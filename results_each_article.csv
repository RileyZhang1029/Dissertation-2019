bioj:a2003-44-SCIENCE,bioj:a2003-44-SCIENCE-C11-mention,ChipViewer,"The creation of new software capable of both visualizing and analyzing the genome tiling arrays was necessary since the concept of genome tiling arrays has not yet been commercialized by Affymetrix. Software capable of chip image deconvolution was developed. The ChipViewer program uses an input file of tiling chip probe information and (x,y) coordinates and multiple CELTM files (containing experimental hybridization data), and produces an output file which contains ordered data for each probe on the chip. Then it sorts the probes of each segment into the actual sequence order of the segment. As output, it generates a file (and a deconvoluted chip image) which lists the intensity values for each probe. The program displays the chip hybridization signals along with various “tracts” including the gene annotation, alongside the full-length cDNA annotation for each corresponding genome segment being interrogated on a tiling chip.
Furthermore, intensity statistics for arbitrary features located on a chip, such as annotated genes and intergenic clusters were computed. Hybridization data were normalized by dividing each probe intensity value in a given experiment by the median intensity value of all probes in that experiment (including PM, MM, and control probes on the chip). The median intensity value of all probes were determined to be a good estimate of the background noise level in a given experiment. Initially we tested the pilot chips and visualization software by hybridizing the arrays with RNA prepared from a single gene. In vitro RNA from an RAFL cDNA clone was synthesized, labeled with biotin and hybridized to one of the four tiling arrays (Fig. S23). Analysis of the hybridization signals using all of the oligos for a particular gene or only the even or odd numbered oligos (Fig. S23), indicate that the gene structures predicted by the visualization software yields the same gene model whether all of the oligos or only the even/odd oligos are used for the prediction. These studies indicated that a genome-wide end-to-end tile of oligos will be equally effective and more space efficient than the overlapping probe design produced for the pilot tiling chips.",

The ranking of candidate EC genes as determined by each of these programmes is illustrated in Table 3. In the case of GeNorm the variable V indi- cating the pairwise variation (Vn/Vn+1) between two sequential normalisation factors (NFn/NFn+1) indicated that three EC genes was the optimal number of genes for accurate normalisation (figure 2), however, target genes expression did not differ significantly if two rather than three EC genes were used (figure 3). Use of all three programmes confirmed that B2M and PPIA was the best combination of genes for normalising RQ-PCR data in CRC tissues (table 3).",
