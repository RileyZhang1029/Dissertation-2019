Inspection of the overlaid structures by using QUANTA (Molec-ular Simulations) clearly shows the presence of a number of extended loops in the VanA N-terminal domain that account for the majority of these extra amino acids (see Fig. 1 b and c).
Numerous attempts to solve the structure of VanA by molecular replacement by using a variety of programs had proved unsuccessful until recent in-house developments in the molecular replacement program MOLREP (10) became available.
Rebuilding from this initial model was carried out by using the X-AUTOFIT routine implemented in the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA).

A variety of parameters was explored in the alignment of the ITS sequences performed with the package ClustalX 1,8-PPC (Thomson et al. 1997). The final alignment was adjusted manually, so as to keep the number of the total mutational changes to a minimum (the aligned data matrix can be obtained from the first author upon request). Indels were included in the analyses and coded according to the principles suggested by Simmons and Ochoterena (2000). Substitutions and indels were given equal weight in all phylogenetic analyses.
All phylogenies were inferred using the program PAUP* version 4.0b6 (Swofford 2001). Bootstrap analyses based on 1,000 replicates were performed to explore the robustness of the trees.

The dynamic modelling of the flux, the interme-diates metabolites and the flux control coefficient de-terminations have been done with the SCAMP (Sim-ulation, Control Analysis, Modelling Package) soft-ware developed by Sauro and Fell [13–16].With this software, the flux control coefficients and the over-all flux response coefficient to an inhibitor are deter-mined by numerical perturbations of the enzyme ac-tivities or inhibitor concentration respectively and re-calculation of the corresponding steady state over a specified range of inhibitor concentrations. The pro-gram also allows calculation of enzyme elasticity with respect to the inhibitors, and partial response coefficients (the product of an enzyme’s flux con-trol coefficient and elasticity with respect to an in-hibitor) [6] in order to assess the relative contribu-tion of each enzyme to the total response to the in-hibitor.
A range of different approaches have been used; for instance FEP [4–6], LIEA [7, 8] and empirical methods such as QSAR [9], CoMFA [10, 11], ‘master equation’ approaches [12–14], total energy correlation [15], ‘knowledge-based’methods [16–19] and methods like CScore [20] and X-Score [21] which combine different approaches.

For comparison, we also computed the inhibition strength of the 53 compounds from our dataset with X-Score [21]. X-Score is a general scoring function and is freely available upon request from its authors. It is derived through multivariate regression analysis of 200 protein–ligand complexes.We applied X-Score to the inhibitor-consensus pocket complexes.
Nevertheless, the 4HVP ligand seems difficult to predict regardless of the compu- tational method used, as it is also mispredicted in three of the four scoring functions employed inCScore [20].
Furthermore, alignment of the Brassica, rice, or wheat ESTs within the IGRs identified an additional 1042 transcription-ally active regions (BLAST e-value < 10 -25, Fig. 1B).
The Phred/Phrap/Consed (2-4) suite of programs was used to assemble sequence reads and perform “finishing” of the assembled sequences.
The creation of new software capable of both visualizing and analyzing the genome tiling arrays was necessary since the concept of genome tiling arrays has not yet been commercialized by Affymetrix. Software capable of chip image deconvolution was developed. The ChipViewer program uses an input file of tiling chip probe information and (x,y) coordinates and multiple CELTM files (containing experimental hybridization data), and produces an output file which contains ordered data for each probe on the chip. Then it sorts the probes of each segment into the actual sequence order of the segment. As output, it generates a file (and a deconvoluted chip image) which lists the intensity values for each probe. The program displays the chip hybridization signals along with various “tracts” including the gene annotation, alongside the full-length cDNA annotation for each corresponding genome segment being interrogated on a tiling chip. 	Furthermore, intensity statistics for arbitrary features located on a chip, such as annotated genes and intergenic clusters were computed. Hybridization data were normalized by dividing each probe intensity value in a given experiment by the median intensity value of all probes in that experiment (including PM, MM, and control probes on the chip). The median intensity value of all probes were determined to be a good estimate of the background noise level in a given experiment. Initially we tested the pilot chips and visualization software by hybridizing the arrays with RNA prepared from a single gene. In vitro RNA from an RAFL cDNA clone was synthesized, labeled with biotin and hybridized to one of the four tiling arrays (Fig. S23). Analysis of the hybridization signals using all of the oligos for a particular gene or only the even or odd numbered oligos (Fig. S23), indicate that the gene structures predicted by the visualization software yields the same gene model whether all of the oligos or only the even/odd oligos are used for the prediction. These studies indicated that a genome-wide end-to-end tile of oligos will be equally effective and more space efficient than the overlapping probe design produced for the pilot tiling chips.
This analysis suggests that 45% of the ANE Arabidopsis genes are transcriptionally active [BLAST e-value < 10 -25,(22)] (Fig. 1A).

The position and orientation of this model were refined against the experimental data using X-PLOR 3.1 (ref. 43). This was performed separately for data from the cell 1 and cell 2 crystal forms. An initial estimate of the particle orientation was obtained from the self-rotation function calculated from the cell 1 data set. Patterson correlation refinement [44] was performed against 60–15-A resolution data to optimize the orientation (final correlation coefficient (cc) of 0.021 for cell 1 and 0.027 for cell 2). The position and orientation of the particle were then refined at 30A with the E1E1 target function [43] (cc = 0.196 for cell 1, 0.195 for cell 2), giving an initial set of non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators for the two cell types. P3 trimers inside the icosahedral asymmetric unit were refined at 6A resolution and NCS operators were re-refined at 8A resolution [43] (cc = 0.375 for cell 1, 0.546 for cell 2). Further refinement of the trimer positions and the NCS operators with data to 5A gave final correlation coefficients of 0.230 and 0.423 for cell 1 and cell 2, respectively.

First, the number of models considered with respect to substi- tution type by ModelTest is a small fraction of the uni- verse of possible models, or even of those models that are reasonable for empirical data sets (Table 1).
For example, appropriate pool of candidate models. For example, ModelTest considers a pool of 56 candidate models. However, with respect to substitution classes, ModelTest examines only eight distinct models.
The program ModelTest (Posada and Crandall, 1998) works in conjunction with PAUP* (Swofford, 2003) to automate this procedure and is presently the most commonly used method of selecting a model for phy-logenetic analysis.

Throughout this study we make use of the restricted growth function notation of partitions to describe mod-els, a scheme for model specification used in PAUP* (Swofford, 2003) and described in Huelsenbeck et al. (2004) to refer to the universe of time-reversible models.
To compare Bayesian and AIC approaches, we used PAUP* (Swofford, 2003) to calculate the AIC score (Akaike, 1973) of each of the 203 time-reversible mod-els for each simulation replicate.
We then used PAUP* (Swofford, 2003) to obtain the likelihood score of this model on the generating tree, estimating the ma-trix parameters and base frequencies (rmatrix = estimate, basefreq = est).

Prime-and-switch phasing in RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2004) was used to minimize model bias. The model was checked and rebuilt manually from the bias-minimized electron-density map from RESOLVE.
The Wind-His, Y53S and Y53F structures were solved by molecular replacement using EPMR (Kissinger et al., 1999) with search models taken from the His-Wind structure (PDB code 1ovn).
The Y55K mutant proved to be more problematic and so PHASER (McCoy et al., 2005) was employed.
The hydrophobic molecular-interac-tion fields at the surfaces of the different mutants were analysed using a DRY probe in the program package GRID (Goodford, 1985). The hydrophobic probe finds favourable locations that interact with other molecule(s) on the surface of a protein in an aqueous environment (Liljefors, 1998). All GRID calculations were performed for the whole volume of the protein using a grid spacing of 1.0 A˚.
The net charge on each of the dimers as calculated using GRIN (Goodford, 1985) are -7.38, -9.05, -11.23 and -13.21 for Wind-His, Y53F, Y53S and Y55K, respectively:
The program ESCET (Schneider, 2002) was used to determine confor-mationally invariant regions between different pairs of mutants. The CSI (conformational similarity index) rela-tive to His-Wind, calculated using ESCET, is in the range of 90% for all the structures except for the Y55K mutant, which has a CSI of around 70%.
The structures were validated with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993).
To analyse the hypothesis that the Wind–Pipe interaction is predominantly hydrophobic, involving aromatic interactions, the relative hydrophobic potentials on the surface shown in Fig. 6 were estimated using a DRY (hydrophobic) probe in the program GRID (Goodford, 1985).

Interval mapping using MapQTL 4.0 to identify the linkage between polymorphic markers and femur total volumetric BMD (vBMD) within the F2 female mice showed three peaks/QTL: peak 1 at marker D1mit453 (Bmd1a, at 165.2 Mb), peak 2 at marker D1mit354 (Bmd1b, at 172.98 Mb), and peak 3 at marker D1mit359 (designated as BMD1-4 at 177.4 Mb) (Fig. 1), which were significantly associated with femoral vBMD.
Map-Maker software also identified three significant linkages at the same positions (Supplemental Table 1), which explained 9.3%, 10.7%, and 9% of the BMD variation within the B6.CAST

Both Statview 5.0 and Prism GraphPad software were used for survival data and mortality curves analysis. We analyzed survival data by Kaplan-Meier analysis in Statview 5.0. The log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test results are presented. Censored data were recorded and analyzed with GraphPad software.
Similar increases in NF1 protein levels were generated by both the heat shock and GAL4-UAS systems, detected by western blot measured using Image J densitometry analysis, mean ± SD of 3 experiments (*:P < 0.05, t - test).
Similar levels of dephosphorylated FOXO were found for w1118, K33 and hsNF1/+;K33, verified by Image J densitometry analysis in 3 experiments, one example shown.
The experimental data was plotted and the constants calculated by using the EnzFitter software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).
In order to evaluate our search strategy, we first analyzed the original SEA matrix using PAUP*4.0b10 (Swofford, 2002) to compare our trees with the SEA topologies. As both analyses resulted in identical trees, the following search strategy was chosen: stepwise addition of 100 random taxa sequences, followed by Tree Bisection-Reconnection (TBR) branch swapping (100 trees held at each step during the stepwise addition, MULTREES on, STEEPEST DESCENT on). Boot-strap analyses were conducted with the same software program, employing a full heuristic search with 500 replicates, a simple addition sequence, and TBR swap-ping (10 trees held at each step, MULTREES on, STEEPEST DESCENT on). The consensus of the bootstrap replicates was used to determine bootstrap values. The search strategy of the wood matrix was adjusted because of excessive computational time to run the analysis to completion. Therefore, MULTREES option was turned off, and a heuristic search using 1000 instead of 100 replicates was carried out. Furthermore, a topological constraint tree had to be postulated in which the ingroup was forced to be monophyletic.
The final cladogram figures were made using MacClade 4.04 (Maddison and Maddison, 2005) and edited with Adobe InDesign CS. As some of the branches in the bootstrap consensus tree are not highly supported, we chose to code uncertainties in character evolution as equivocal. In addition, the option ‘‘soft polytomies’’ was used.

The statistical tests were performed using MorphoCode, an open-source software program that implements the gap weighting method (Schols et al., 2004).
138 of the 222 EST contigs that lacked an alignment over at least 50% of their length had an identifiable alignment to human refseq genes by BLASTP (19) (-e 1e-5), indicating that they are likely to represent bona fide protein-coding transcripts rather than artifactual sequence.
Long branch lengths, indicating increased lev-els of sequence divergence, were found along the fly, nematode, and sea squirt lineages, consistent with systematic trends observed in BLAST-based analyses of ESTs (17, 18).
Of 1,152 sample sequences, 99.9% were passing, and 80% possessed significant BLASTX hits (E-value < 1E-5).
The first and largest group (type I novelty) comprises animal genes that have no identifiable relatives (with BLAST) outside of animals in the available sequence data sets, and accounts for 15% (1186) of ancestral eumetazoan genes.
The shotgun reads were trimmed of low quality and vector-derived sequence, and assembled using JAZZ (10, 11). Approximately one third of the shotgun reads are composed entirely of high copy-number repeat sequences, and are therefore masked at the alignment stage of JAZZ, and therefore remain unassembled.
To approximate the gene repertoire of the eu-metazoan ancestor, we constructed 7766 putatively orthologous gene families that are anchored by reciprocal best-scoring BLAST alignments (33) between genes from anemone and one or more of fly, nematode, human, frog, or puffer-fish (32).
Whereas ~22,000 of all predicted genes have a significant alignment [Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) e value < 10–10] to known proteins in SwissProt/Trembl and therefore have some homology support, analysis of a random sampling of genes suggests that some of these appear to be gene fragments, possible pseudo-genes, relics of transposable elements, or allelic variants, leading to a discounting of the true gene count to ~18,000 (32).
tRNAScan-SE (20) was used to look for tRNAs and BLASTN (19) against nr and Repbase (21) to identify the 5S,18S,28S,U2,U6 RNAs, and two Nematostella transposons (see below).

We aligned the collected transcript sequences to the two genome sequences by using BLAT [51] to obtain a dataset for tag annotations. The threshold parameters set for aligned transcripts are (1) at least 90% identical to their genomic sequences and (2) covering ≥ 90% transcript sequences. When a transcript has more than one hit to genomic sequences, the longest consensus was selected as the best-aligned (true) locus. We further selected sequences that span the 3' end of a predicted gene but do not extend to the next with ≥ 100-bp overlapping sequences.

High-level ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq analysis. Intersect regions. To identify regions of significant intersection between enriched region lists from various data sets, the USeq IntersectRegions application was used. This application counts the number of intersections between two lists of genomic coordinates that occur within a minimum ‘max gap’ distance. To estimate confidence in the intersections, a thousand ‘random’ data sets are generated that were matched to the chromosome and size of the original regions, and randomly picked from the interrogated regions on the array or sequenced regions in the genome.
Intersect lists. To determine whether the 4- and 8-cell transcripts identified in early human embryo correlated with any of our histone modifications we used The IntersectLists USeq application which uses random permutation to calculate the significance of intersection between two lists of genes.
The 26-bp and 36-bp reads were generated using Illumina’s Genome Analyser II and their standard software pipeline. Reads were mapped to the March 2006 NCBI Build 36.1 human genome using the pipeline’s eland_extended aligner.
The USeq package [6] was used to identify regions of histone enrichment relative to input control. This entailed selecting reads that mapped with an alignment score >= 13 (-10log10(0.05)), shifting their centre position 73 bp 3' to accommo-date the 146-bp mononucleosome fragment length, and using a sliding window of 300 bp to score each region in the genome for significant histone enrichment. Significance was determined by calculating a binomial P value for each 300-bp window and controlled for multiple testing by applying Storey’s q value FDR estimation [38], [39].
The gene lists were uploaded in GoMiner (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/gominer/htgm.jsp) to identify over represented Gene Ontology terms.
To assess histone enrichment consistency, the QCSeqs application in the USeq package [6] as used to correlate the read counts between the D1 and pooled sample by calculating a Pearson correlation on the basis of the number of mapped reads falling within 500-bp windowed regions stepped every 250 bp across all chromosomes. Only windows with five or more reads in either of the samples were included in the correlation.

Figure 2 Analysis of candidate EC genes using geNorm. (A): Average expression stability values of eligible EC genes. Expression stability of the control genes as calculated by geNorm. Stability
For GeNorm, lower stability values (M) indicate greater stability. In the case of NormFinder, stability is calculated from inter- and intra-group variation. By grouping the tissues into tumour and normal the best combination of genes was identified. For geNorm stability was based on the estimation of pair-wise variation.

In the present study the stability of expression of candi- date EC genes was determined using a pair-wise com- parison model: geNorm [8] and an MS Excel ANOVA based model, NormFinder [35]. No effect of disease sta- tus EC gene expression was identified in colorectal tis- sue. Since both geNorm and NormFinder are based on the assumption that candidate genes are not differen- tially expressed between samples, this was an important first step prior to their continued use [9,10].

In this study GeNorm was used to identify the most stably expressed EC genes from our panel of candidates and also provided a measure of the optimal number of EC genes. B2M and PPIA were identified as the most stable pairing. In order to achieve a pair-wise variation value (V) below the cut-off of 0.15 additional genes should theoretically be used; however this cut-off point is not absolute [14] and may not always be achievable [42]. No significant difference in target gene expression was observed when the top three most stable EC genes identified by geNorm were used confirming that using of a pair of genes may be more practicable given cost, work load and sample availability considerations.
It is further validated with qBasePlus.
NormFinder was designed to identify EC genes with the lowest stability values; these values are calculated based on intra- and inter-group variation. In this study NormFinder was used to define the best combination of genes using tumour and normal as group identifiers in the calculations
QBasePlus real-time PCR data manager programme was developed based on geNorm and qBase [36] algorithms. QBasePlus was used to confirm our selection of the B2M and PPIA pairing as the best combination of ECs in colorectal tissue.
QBasePlus through its components, geNorm and qBase, identified coefficient of variation (CV) and stability (M) values and thereby the best combination of genes for normalisation only when more than one gene is used.
QBasePlus was used for calculation of PDCD4 expression relative to each of the EC genes. It applies ∆∆Ct method was used where ∆∆Ct =(Ct target gene, test sample - Ct endogenous control, test sample) - (Ct target gene, calibrator sample - Ct endogenous control, calibrator sample). Relative quanti- ties were corrected for efficiency of amplification and fold change in gene expression between groups was cal- culated as E-∆∆Ct ± s.e.m. Where more than one endo- genous control are used, fold change estimates were calculated using the geometric mean of EC quantities relative to the calibrator sample which could be the minimum, maximum or a named sample or an average.
Sta- tistical analysis was carried out with Minitab® 15 (Mini- tab Ltd, Coventry, UK).

Stability of the EC genes expression was evaluated with two freely available statistical models, geNorm and NormFinder.
Stability was further evaluated using qBasePlus [8,36], a commer- cially available RQ-PCR data mining package. These programmes were used to calculate amplification effi- ciency-corrected relative quantities from raw fluores- cence data. The ranking of candidate EC genes as determined by each of these programmes is illustrated in Table 3. In the case of GeNorm the variable V indi- cating the pairwise variation (Vn/Vn+1) between two sequential normalisation factors (NFn/NFn+1) indicated that three EC genes was the optimal number of genes for accurate normalisation (figure 2), however, target genes expression did not differ significantly if two rather than three EC genes were used (figure 3). Use of all three programmes confirmed that B2M and PPIA was the best combination of genes for normalising RQ-PCR data in CRC tissues (table 3).

The GeNorm programme calculates a normalisation factor (NF) which is used to determine the optimal number of EC genes required for accurate normalisation. This factor is calculated using the variable V as the pairwise variation (Vn/Vn + 1) between two sequential NFs (NFn and NFn + 1). To meet the recommended cut off V-value which is the point at which it is unnecessary to include additional genes in a normalisation strategy. The recommended limit for V value is 0.15 but it is not always achievable. In this instance, the GeNorm output file indicated that the optimal number of genes required for normalisation was three.
