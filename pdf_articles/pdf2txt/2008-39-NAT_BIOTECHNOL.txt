More effective therapies are urgently needed against hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of viral hepatitis. We used in vitro
protein expression and microÔ¨Çuidic afÔ¨Ånity analysis to study RNA binding by the HCV transmembrane protein NS4B, which
plays an essential role in HCV RNA replication. We show that HCV NS4B binds RNA and that this binding is speciÔ¨Åc for the
3¬¢ terminus of the negative strand of the viral genome with a dissociation constant (Kd) of B3.4 nM. A high-throughput
microÔ¨Çuidic screen of a compound library identiÔ¨Åed 18 compounds that substantially inhibited binding of RNA by NS4B. One of
these compounds, clemizole hydrochloride, was found to inhibit HCV RNA replication in cell culture that was mediated by its
suppression of NS4B‚Äôs RNA binding, with little toxicity for the host cell. These results yield new insight into the HCV life cycle
and provide a candidate compound for pharmaceutical development.

Over 150 million people are infected with HCV worldwide. Unfortu-
nately, many of these individuals are unable to clear their infection
with the current standard of care, which consists of a combination of
interferon and ribavirin1 (Copegus, Rebetol, Rebetron, Virazole).
Moreover, this treatment is associated with substantial side effects,
precluding its use by many individuals. Thus, current therapies are
inadequate for the majority of patients1, and there is a pressing need
for new HCV drugs1.

The 9.6-kb, positive, single-stranded RNA HCV genome encodes a
3,000-amino-acid polyprotein that is proteolytically processed into
structural proteins, which are components of the mature virus, and
nonstructural proteins (NS), which are involved in replicating the viral
genome2. Like other positive-strand RNA viruses3, HCV appears to
replicate in association with intracellular membrane structures. In the
case of HCV, the structures are termed the membranous web4 and are
believed to be induced by the NS4B protein. NS4B is also required to
assemble the other viral NS proteins within the apparent sites of RNA
replication5. It is not known how viral RNA, especially the negative-
strand template required for production of progeny genomes, might
be incorporated or maintained at these replication sites.

NS4B and HCV RNA have been shown to colocalize to the
membranous web6,7, suggesting that NS4B is in intimate contact
with viral RNA in the context of authentic viral RNA replication.
The hepatitis A and polio picornaviruses have proteins termed 2C,
which are required for replication, bind RNA8,9 and have an
N-terminal amphipathic helix and a nucleotide binding motif 8‚Äì10.
NS4B contains the same structural features, and both of them are
required for HCV replication5,11. We thus hypothesized that NS4B

may similarly bind RNA, that this interaction might be critical for the
HCV life cycle, and that RNA binding by NS4B could be amenable to
pharmacologic disruption. To test these hypotheses, we established an
in vitro RNA binding assay in a format enabling simultaneous
analysis of multiple conditions, mutants, replicates, quantitative
Kd measurements and high-throughput
screening for potential
pharmacologic inhibitors.

Like the majority of drug targets12, NS4B is a membrane protein.
Membrane proteins are notoriously difÔ¨Åcult to express and character-
ize biochemically, especially in the quantities required for pharma-
ceutical screening. Moreover, solubilization by detergents can alter
their natural membrane-associated topology. To ameliorate these
problems, we used microÔ¨Çuidic tools to perform binding assays
with nanoliter protein consumption. This enabled use of an in vitro
cell lysate expression system, which was supplemented with micro-
somal membranes to create more natural folding conditions, under
which the best NS4B topology data available to date have been
obtained13. The reduced yield relative to conventional expression
methods is offset by low sample consumption.

Previous microÔ¨Çuidic tools to measure drug interactions have been
limited to enzymatic targets that can catalyze formation of a Ô¨Çuor-
escent substrate14. In this case we directly measured binding constants
by using mechanical trapping of molecular interactions (MITOMI), a
microÔ¨Çuidic afÔ¨Ånity assay that has previously been used to measure
interactions between transcription factors and DNA15. We have
extended the previous work by showing that MITOMI can be used
to measure both binding constants of membrane protein-RNA inter-
actions and inhibition of such interactions by small molecules in a

high-throughput screen. The latter point was particularly surprising in
that the elastomer used to fabricate the device is known to have
limitations in chemical compatibility16,17; here we show that this does
not prevent its use in a drug screen or the discovery of a small
molecule with the desired pharmacological properties. Taken together,
the results of this paper reveal a novel HCV target and show that
microÔ¨Çuidic technology can be used to discover a new pharmaceutical,
thereby validating the use of microÔ¨Çuidic tools in drug discovery18,19.

RESULTS
We validated the use of the microÔ¨Çuidic platform for RNA binding by
studying two human proteins from the embryonic lethal abnormal
visual system (ELAV) family, the RNA binding activity of which is
well characterized20‚Äì22. We then applied this methodology to study
RNA interactions with the transmembrane HCV NS4B protein. We
(i) tested the hypothesis that HCV NS4B binds RNA, (ii) determined
the Kd for this interaction, (iii) studied the substrate speciÔ¨Åcity of this
binding, (iv) determined the amino acids within NS4B required for
RNA binding and (v) screened a compound library for pharmacologic
inhibitors of NS4B RNA binding and HCV replication.

MicroÔ¨Çuidic assay validation: HuD binding to RNA
HuD is a host cell protein from the ELAV-like family with well-
characterized RNA binding activity20‚Äì22. It is a cytoplasmic protein
that contains three conserved RNA recognition motifs through which
it binds AU-rich elements in the 3¬¢ untranslated region (UTR) of genes
such as those encoding cytokines and proto-oncogenes. Binding was
tested against two Cy3-labeled RNA probes: AU3 and a known AU3
mutant to which HuD binding is impaired21,22 (Fig. 1). RNA binding
experiments with MITOMI were performed essentially as described15,
except that in this case RNA was used instead of DNA (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1 online). BrieÔ¨Çy, we spotted a microarray of target RNA
sequences labeled with Cy3 onto an epoxy-coated slide. These arrays
were used to program the microÔ¨Çuidic devices by aligning each spot in
the array to a unit cell in the device. After bonding the microÔ¨Çuidic
device to a microarray it was subjected to surface patterning that

resulted in a circular area coated with biotinylated antihistidine
antibodies within each unit cell. The device was then loaded with
an in vitro transcription-translation mixture
containing DNA
templates coding for HuD fused in-frame with a C-terminal V5-6
histidine tag (HuD-V5-his) or Gus protein fused in-frame with a
C-terminal 6 histidine tag (Gus-his). Bodipy-labeled tRNALys was
added for protein labeling. Each unit cell was then isolated using
micromechanical valves followed by an incubation to allow protein
synthesis, binding of the synthesized protein to the surface biotiny-
lated anti-his antibodies, solvation of target RNA and equilibration of
proteins and target RNA. MITOMI was then performed by actuation
of a ‚Äòbutton‚Äô membrane to trap surface-bound complexes while
expelling any solution-phase molecules. After a brief wash to remove
untrapped, unbound material, the trapped molecules and expressed
protein were subsequently detected with an array scanner. The ratio of
bound RNA to expressed protein was calculated for each data point by
measuring the median signal of Cy3 to the median signal of bodipy.
The assay detected strong binding of HuD to the AU3 RNA probe;
background binding by Gus-his was 7- to 16-fold lower than the HuD
signal (Fig. 1a). This background level did not increase with RNA
probe concentration and was subtracted from all chambers (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2 online). The binding afÔ¨Ånity of HuD to the AU3 probe
was much greater than that of the AU3 mutant probe: the Kd for AU3
binding was 23 ¬± 5 nM and that for AU3 mutant binding was 268 ¬±
95 nM (Fig. 1a). These values agree with previous measurements in a
gel shift assay21,22 and validate the MITOMI microÔ¨Çuidic afÔ¨Ånity assay
for RNA-protein interactions. RNA binding analysis of another
protein from the ELAV-like family, HuR, is shown in Supplementary
Fig. 3 online.

NS4B binds HCV RNA and Kd is determined by microÔ¨Çuidics
We then tested whether HCV NS4B binds RNA. Because NS4B is
important in viral RNA replication, and initiation of positive-strand
RNA synthesis is likely to start at the 3¬¢ terminus of the negative-
strand RNA, we Ô¨Årst tested binding of NS4B to this region, using a
probe designated 3¬¢ negative terminus. A fusion of the amphipathic

helix of NS5A to the N terminus of GFP5 was used as a negative
control. This protein also binds to membranes and can thus anchor
the microsomal membranes to the device surface through the inter-
action of GFP with anti-GFP (Fig. 1c). The Kd of NS4B binding to the
3¬¢ terminus of the HCV negative-strand RNA was measured at 3.4 ¬±
1.0 nM (Fig. 1d). To the best of our knowledge this is the Ô¨Årst report
that HCV NS4B binds RNA. Conventional glutathione-S-transferase
(GST) pull-down assays and RNA Ô¨Ålter binding assays using recom-
binant forms of puriÔ¨Åed NS4B expressed in Escherichia coli conÔ¨Årmed
this Ô¨Ånding (Supplementary Fig. 4 online), although these were
less convenient and amenable to the types of analyses and high-
throughput format that we sought.

NS4B speciÔ¨Åcally binds the 3¬¢ terminus of the (‚Äì) viral strand
We measured the substrate speciÔ¨Åcity of the observed NS4B-HCV
RNA interaction with three additional HCV probes (Fig. 2a). The
probes designated 5¬¢ UTR pos and 3¬¢ UTR pos correspond to the
5¬¢ UTR and 3¬¢ UTR sequences of the positive viral strand, respectively,

Figure 2 NS4B binds speciÔ¨Åcally to the 3¬¢ terminus of the HCV negative-
strand RNA. (a) Four HCV probes were designed. 5¬¢ UTR pos and 3¬¢ UTR
pos corresponded to the 5¬¢ UTR and 3¬¢ UTR sequences of the positive viral
strand, respectively, and 5¬¢ negative terminus and 3¬¢ negative terminus
corresponded to the 5¬¢ and 3¬¢ terminal regions of the negative strand,
respectively. The position of these sequences with respect to the HCV open
reading frame (ORF) is shown. (b) Fractional binding of NS4B to equimolar
concentrations of the four HCV probes and to a non-HCV RNA (delta virus

the bars represent the standard error.

and 5¬¢ negative terminus corresponds to the 5¬¢ terminus of the
negative strand. The RNA binding experiment was repeated and
binding of NS4B to equimolar concentrations (3 nM) of the various
probes was compared. Whereas NS4B binds all four HCV probes, its
apparent afÔ¨Ånity to the 3¬¢ negative terminus probe is 5- to 12-fold
greater than to the other three HCV RNA regions tested or to an
unrelated delta virus RNA genome sequence23,24 (see Fig. 2b). These
Ô¨Åndings suggest that it is the RNA sequence, and likely the secondary
RNA structure, that determines the speciÔ¨Åcity of NS4B binding to the
3¬¢ terminus of the negative strand.

An ARM in NS4B is essential for RNA binding and HCV
replication
Various structural motifs responsible for the interaction between
proteins and RNA have been reported25. One of these is the arginine
rich motif (ARM). ARMs were originally deÔ¨Åned as short (10 to 20
amino acids) arginine-rich sequences found in viral, bacteriophage
and ribosomal proteins (Fig. 3a)9,25,26. There is little identity between
ARM sequences, other than the preponderance of arginine residues.
Subsequently, ARM-like motifs, consisting of longer sequences con-
taining fewer arginines, were identiÔ¨Åed9,26. Inspection of the primary
sequence of NS4B reveals the presence of multiple positively charged
amino acids (Fig. 3b). The majority of these arginine residues are
within the last 71 amino acids, in the C-terminal region of NS4B
(Fig. 3b,c). This
region is predicted to form a cytoplasmic
segment based on empirical topology studies using glycosylation
markers13. Elements of this region conform with previously described
ARM-like motifs.

Using a series of point mutations, we tested if RNA binding by
NS4B is mediated by some of its positively charged residues. A
substitution of Arg-Arg in positions 192‚Äì193 with Ala-Ala was termed
‚ÄòRRa mutant‚Äô and a similar substitution in positions 247‚Äì248 was
designated ‚ÄòRRb mutant‚Äô. Whereas the RRb mutant decreased binding
by NS4B to the 3¬¢ negative terminus probe by Ô¨Åvefold, RNA binding
activity to the RRa mutant was completely eliminated at the same
probe concentration (1.5 nM; Fig. 3d). These results suggest that the
tested arginine residues mediate RNA binding by NS4B in vitro. To test
the hypothesis that these positively charged residues are also impor-
tant for HCV replication, we introduced these mutations into high-
efÔ¨Åciency subgenomic HCV replicons and assayed them in standard
replicon colony formation assays (data not shown). The various
mutations substantially impaired HCV RNA replication and the
degree of replication inhibition correlated with the degree of NS4B
RNA binding impairment (unpublished data). These results suggest
that efÔ¨Åcient binding of HCV RNA is required for viral replication
in vitro. Alignment of the sequences of natural HCV isolates currently
available in databases reveals that these positively charged residues are
highly conserved across all HCV genotypes. This conservation suggests
that

productive viral infection in vivo.

High-throughput screening for inhibitory compounds
We screened a compound library for small molecules that could inhibit
the RNA-NS4B interaction. We spotted 1,280 compounds from a
small-molecule library on epoxy-coated slides in a microarray format
(Fig. 4a). The array was allowed to dry and was then aligned and
bonded to a microÔ¨Çuidic device. The rest of the assay was performed as
before, except that the device was loaded with NS4B-GFP followed by
Cy5-labeled 3¬¢ terminus negative RNA probe. In the primary screen,
the compounds were spotted at a concentration of B1 mM. The entire
library was screened in duplicate using only two microÔ¨Çuidic devices.
Out of 1,280 compounds, 104 were found to have an inhibitory effect

Figure 4 Small-molecule screen reveals that clemizole hydrochloride inhibits
RNA binding by NS4B and HCV RNA replication in cell culture. (a) The Ô¨Årst
screen represented a low-stringency measurement of inhibition of 1,280
compounds where the latter were categorized as having high (green),
ambiguous (blue) or no (red) inhibition. Based on the initial screen, 214
compounds were then measured again with higher stringency and with a
greater number of replicates and the best 18 inhibitors were tested for their
ability to inhibit HCV replication via a cellular assay. (b) In vitro inhibition of

(490% inhibition) on RNA binding by NS4B. In addition, there were
110 compounds for which there was a substantial discrepancy between
the two tested replicates or for which one or two of the measurements
had been disrupted due to technical errors.

The 214 compounds (104 + 110) identiÔ¨Åed in the primary screen
were subjected to a secondary screen (Fig. 4a). This was done in a
similar manner except that a smaller device was used, the spotted
compound concentration was tenfold lower than in the primary
screen and Ô¨Åve replicates were spotted for each compound. Eighteen
compounds were conÔ¨Årmed to substantially inhibit RNA binding by
NS4B out of the 214 compounds tested (Fig. 4b). Six of these
compounds were tested for speciÔ¨Åcity; Ô¨Åve of them did not inhibit
binding of HuR protein to its own 4A target RNA sequence (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3) nor did they inhibit HuR binding to its previously
described HCV RNA target, that is the 3¬¢ terminus of the negative viral
strand27, suggesting that these hits are speciÔ¨Åc. This data and addi-
tional data supporting the validity of the screen are presented in
Supplementary Data and Supplementary Fig. 5 online.

Inhibitors of HCV RNA replication
We measured the inhibitory effect on HCV RNA replication of the
compounds identiÔ¨Åed in the above screen in cell culture. After
electroporation with a full-length HCV RNA genome harboring a
luciferase reporter gene28, Huh7.5 cells were grown in the presence of
increasing concentrations of these compounds. Luciferase assays were
performed at 72 h. In parallel, the viability of cells in the presence of
the compounds was assessed by an Alamar Blue‚Äìbased assay. Six of
the compounds showed some antiviral effect above that solely
attributable to cellular toxicity. One of these, clemizole hydrochloride
(1-p-chlorobenzyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) methylbenzimidazole
hydro-
chloride), an H1 histamine receptor antagonist, was found to sub-
stantially inhibit HCV replication. A tenfold decrease in viral
replication was measured at 20 mM concentration of the drug, with
an half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of B8 mM (Fig. 4c).
At these concentrations there was no measurable cellular toxicity
(Fig. 4c). Similar results were obtained by real-time PCR assays
performed in clemizole-treated Huh7.5 cells infected with the infec-
tious HCV clone (J6/JFH)29 (Supplementary Fig. 6 online). The
in vitro half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of clemizole for
RNA binding by NS4B is B24 ¬± 1 nM (Fig. 4d).

Clemizole-resistant mutants
The mechanism of action of clemizole‚Äôs antiviral activity was further
substantiated by selecting for clemizole-resistant HCV mutants.
Established HCV replicon-harboring cells and Huh7 cells electropo-
rated de novo with a genotype 1b subgenomic HCV replicon
(Bart 79I)30 were passaged in the presence of the drug, yielding

B60 colonies that were able to grow in the presence of the compound.
Eleven individual colonies were successfully expanded, passaged 5‚Äì10
times and the HCV RNA replicating in the cells was subjected to
sequence analysis. In addition, RNA from a pool of clemizole-resistant
colonies was isolated and subjected to a similar analysis. Three
colonies were found to harbor replicons with mutations that mapped
to the NS4B region, and six colonies were found to harbor replicons
with mutations that mapped to the negative strand 3¬¢ terminus RNA
region. In addition there was one colony with mutations that mapped
to both NS4B and the negative strand 3¬¢ terminus, and one where we
have yet to Ô¨Ånd the location of the mutation conferring resistance to
clemizole. No such mutations were identiÔ¨Åed in ten replicon colonies
that were passaged in parallel in the absence of the drug.

Two of the clemizole-resistant NS4B mutants were characterized in
detail. The Ô¨Årst, W55R is depicted in Figure 5a. It involves the
substitution of an arginine for the tryptophan at amino acid 55
within a predicted cytoplasmically oriented segment of NS4B. This
mutation is sufÔ¨Åcient to confer a clemizole-resistant phenotype in
cells: Huh7.5 cells transfected with either whole-cell RNA extracted
from the W55R mutant cells (Fig. 5b) or with in vitro-transcribed J6/
JFH RNA encoding this point mutation and a linked luciferase
reporter gene (Fig. 5c) were unaffected by 10 mM clemizole. The
EC50 of clemizole on the W55R mutant J6/JFH RNA was B18 mM
(2.25 times the EC50 of the wild-type RNA). Similar to other HCV
mutants resistant to an NS3 protease inhibitor31, the absolute level of
replication of the W55R mutant was lower than that of the wild-type
genome, suggesting that the drug-resistant mutation comes at the cost
of impaired replication Ô¨Åtness.

We also introduced this mutation into the NS4B-GFP vector and
tested it for its RNA binding activity using the in vitro micro-
Ô¨Çuidic assay. Although both mutant and wild-type NS4B proteins

experienced an approximately twofold reduction of RNA binding in
the presence of 10 nM clemizole, because the baseline RNA binding of
the mutant is higher, the residual amount of RNA bound by the
mutant in the presence of clemizole was comparable to that bound by
the wild type in the absence of clemizole (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, this
mutant demonstrates greater apparent afÔ¨Ånity to the viral RNA with a
Kd of 0.75 nM (versus 3.4 nM for wild-type NS4B) (Fig. 5e).

The second clemizole-resistant mutation,

termed R214Q, was
identiÔ¨Åed in a resistant colony as well as in pooled resistant cells. It
involves the substitution of a glutamine for the arginine at amino acid
214 within the cytoplasmic C-terminal segment of NS4B. Similar
results to the Ô¨Årst mutation were obtained in cellular and in vitro
analyses done on this mutation, with an EC50 of 40.3 mM (B5 times
higher than the EC50 on the wild-type RNA) in the luciferase
reporter‚Äìlinked replication assay and a Kd of 0.6 nM in the
in vitro binding assay (data not shown). Presumably both of these
mutations alter the conformation of NS4B so as to increase its
afÔ¨Ånity for the viral RNA. Indeed the Kds measured by the in vitro
RNA binding assay reÔ¨Çect this. Taken together, the above data
provide genetic and biochemical evidence for clemizole‚Äôs mechanism
of action.

DISCUSSION
The above results demonstrate that HCV NS4B binds RNA and that
this binding is speciÔ¨Åc for the 3¬¢ terminus of the negative strand of the
viral genome. Because the in vivo speciÔ¨Åcity of this interaction has not
yet been determined quantitatively, one should use the usual caution
in extrapolating the numerical value of our in vitro results. We also
showed that an arginine rich‚Äìlike motif in NS4B is essential for RNA
binding and for HCV replication. Clemizole hydrochloride was found
to have a substantial
inhibitory effect on HCV RNA replication
mediated by its suppression of NS4B‚Äôs RNA binding.

Because NS4B is associated with membranes5 and is known to
induce membrane replication sites4, its RNA binding activity offers a
mechanism to incorporate the viral genome into the HCV replication
compartment. This may facilitate the initiation of synthesis of the
nascent positive strand from the membrane-anchored negative strand.
NS4B may also act by recruiting the polymerase complex to the HCV
RNA, through its interaction with the NS5B polymerase or other
components of the replication complex32.

The in vitro IC50 of clemizole for RNA binding by NS4B is B24 ¬±
1 nM, whereas its EC50 for viral replication is B8 mM. It is possible
that poor cellular permeability accounts for the B400-fold difference
between the IC50 measured for in vitro RNA binding by NS4B and the
EC50 measured for the antiviral effect in cells. We hypothesize that
improved drug delivery and optimization of the compound after
structure-activity relationship analysis will improve its potency as an
antiviral agent and that the microÔ¨Çuidic platform can facilitate
this process.

This study also demonstrates the utility of a microÔ¨Çuidic approach.
The microÔ¨Çuidic afÔ¨Ånity assay has several important advantages over
currently used methods, which make it a promising and general tool
for drug discovery, especially against membrane-bound targets. First,
protein synthesis by mammalian reticulocyte lysates in the presence
of microsomal membranes provides the natural conditions required
for protein folding. Second, the microÔ¨Çuidic assay eliminates the
need for a high level of protein expression and puriÔ¨Åcation, a
problem common to currently used methods. Third, this assay is
capable of detecting transient and low-afÔ¨Ånity interactions15. Fourth,
the microÔ¨Çuidic device is capable of making many parallel measure-
ments, and therefore can be used for high-throughput screening.
Finally, we have shown, in spite of known chemical compatibility
issues with the elastomer used to fabricate the device, that one can
successfully screen and discover small molecules with desired phar-
macological properties.

As with HIV and tuberculosis, effective pharmacologic control of
HCV will likely best be achieved by a cocktail of several drugs against
independent virus-speciÔ¨Åc targets. Combination of even a moderate
NS4B inhibitor with other emerging anti-HCV agents represents an
attractive paradigm for increasing current virologic response rates.
Although we hypothesize that more potent inhibitors than clemizole
can be obtained, because clemizole has already been extensively used
in humans (albeit for a different indication based on its antipruritic
properties) it may Ô¨Ånd immediate use as a critical component of next
generation anti-HCV strategies.

METHODS
Plasmids. Standard recombinant DNA technology was used to construct and
purify all plasmids. All regions that were ampliÔ¨Åed by PCR were analyzed by
automated DNA sequencing. Plasmid DNAs were prepared from large-scale
bacterial cultures and puriÔ¨Åed by aMaxiprep kit (Marligen Biosciences).
Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs.

The open reading frames (ORF) of HuR and HuD were obtained from the
ORFeome library of cDNA clones (Open Biosystems). These ORFs were
inserted into the expression vectorpcDNA-Dest 40 vector (Invitrogen) by the
use of gateway technology (Invitrogen) allowing addition of a C-terminal
V5-his tag.

The plasmid pcDNA-NS4B-GFP encoding NS4B of genotype 1a fused in
frame with a C-terminal GFP was previously described5. The mutations RRa,
RRb and W55R were introduced into this plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis
(using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene)). The plasmid NS5A(AH)GFP was
constructed as previously reported. Gus-his vector was obtained from Roche.
The plasmids pcDNA3.1-5¬¢ UTR pos, which encodes the 5¬¢ UTR of the
positive viral strand, was generated by ampliÔ¨Åcation of the 5¬¢ UTR positive
sequence from the Bart79I plasmid33 with primers containing EcoRV restriction
sites, digestion with EcoRV and ligation into the corresponding site in
pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The plasmid pcDNA3.1- 3¬¢ negative terminus, which
encodes the 3¬¢ terminal region of the negative RNA strand, was generated
the same way except
the EcoRV-Ô¨Çanked insert was ligated in an
inverse orientation.

The plasmids pcDNA3.1 ‚Äì 3¬¢ UTR pos and 5¬¢ negative terminus were
similarly generated except that the inserted gene was Ô¨Çanked by HindIII and
Xho1 restriction sites.

that

The vector encoding the delta virus genomic RNA sequence was cloned by
inserting NheI-Ô¨Çanked HDV sequence into a pSPT19 vector (Roche Diagnos-
tics) cut with XbaI23,24.

The plasmid FL-J6/JFH-5¬¢C19Rluc2AUbi that consists of the full-length
HCV genome and expresses Renilla luciferase was a gift from Charles M. Rice28.
The W55R mutation was introduced into this plasmid by site-directed
mutagenesis (using the QuikChange kit).

In vitro RNA transcription and Ô¨Çuorescent and radioactive labeling. Plasmid
DNA of the 5¬¢ and 3¬¢ terminal regions of the negative and positive viral strands
were linearized with XbaI. The plasmid DNA of the delta genomic sequence
was linearized with XbaI. Linearized plasmids were then treated with proteinase
K, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitation with ethanol.
The DNA was resuspended in RNase-free water to a Ô¨Ånal concentration of
1 mg/ml. We used 4 mg of DNA as a template for transcription with the T7
MEGAscript (Ambion) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol. The template
DNA was digested by the addition of 5 U of RQ1 DNase (Ambion) and a
15-min incubation at 37 1C. The unincorporated ribonucleotides were removed
by size exclusion with a Micro Bio-Spin P-30 column (Bio-Rad), and the
transcribed RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, followed by precipita-
tion in ethanol. The RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended
in H2O. Determination of the RNA concentration was performed by measure-
ment of the optical density at 260 nm. The integrity of the RNA and its
concentration were conÔ¨Årmed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium
bromide staining.

The RNA sequences were labeled with Cy5 by using Label IT kit (Mirus)
followed by puriÔ¨Åcation on a
according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol
microspin column (Mirus) and ethanol precipitation. The number of Ô¨Çuor-
escent labels per RNA molecule was determined by measuring the spectro-
photometric absorbance of the nucleic-dye conjugate at 260 nm and the lMAX
for Cy5 (650 nm). This was proportional to the probe‚Äôs length and was used to
adjust our binding experiments results.

Cy3-labeled RNA probes used to study RNA binding by HuR and HuD were

purchased from IDT.

Radioactive labeling of RNA probes with 32P was done as previously

described34.

Device design. Device fabrication and design was done essentially as
described15. In brief, a ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô layer, which harbors all channels required to
actuate the valves, is situated on top of a ‚ÄòÔ¨Çow‚Äô layer, which contains the
network of channels being controlled. All biological assays and Ô¨Çuid manipula-
tions are performed on the Ô¨Çow layer. A valve is created where a control channel
crosses a Ô¨Çow channel. The resulting thin membrane in the junction between
the two channels can be deÔ¨Çected by hydraulic actuation. Using multiplexed
valve systems allows a large number of elastomeric microvalves to perform
complex Ô¨Çuidic manipulations within these devices. Introduction of Ô¨Çuid into
these devices is accomplished through stainless steel pins inserted into holes
punched through the silicone. Computer-controlled external solenoid valves
allow actuation of multiplexors, which in turn allow complex addressing of a
large number of microvalves. Each unit cell is controlled by three micro-
mechanical valves as well as a ‚Äòbutton‚Äô membrane (Supplementary Fig. 1). The
‚Äòbutton membrane‚Äô of each unit cell masks a circular area within the Ô¨Çow
channel between two ‚Äòsandwich‚Äô valves. Aligning and bonding a microarray to
the device allows positioning of the spotted material (RNA probes or inhibitory
compounds) within the ‚ÄòRNA chamber‚Äô of each unit cell. This chamber can

RNA binding assay. The approach used was a modiÔ¨Åcation of
the
previously described method for protein-DNA interactions15 (Supplementary

For soluble proteins: RNA arraying and device alignment. A dilution series of
Cy3-labeled target RNA sequences were spotted as a microarray onto epoxy-
coated glass substrates slide (CEL Associates) by OmniGrid Micro (GeneMa-
chines) microarrayer using a CMP3B pin (TeleChem International) with
column and row pitches of 680 mm and 320 mm, respectively. Each sample
solution contained 1% BSA in dH2O to prevent covalent linkage of the target
RNA to the epoxy functional groups as well as for visualization during

alignment. After spotting the arrays were quality controlled on a GenePix4000b
(Molecular Devices). The arrays were then aligned to a microÔ¨Çuidic device by
hand on a SMZ1500 (Nikon) stereoscope and bonded overnight in the dark on
a heated plate at 40 1C.

Surface chemistry (Supplementary Fig. 1c online). All devices were driven
between 10 and 15 p.s.i. in the control line and between 4 and 6 p.s.i. for the
Ô¨Çow line. For the initial surface-derivatization steps the chamber valves
remained closed to prevent liquid from entering the chambers containing the
spotted RNA targets. First, all accessible surface area was derivatized by Ô¨Çowing
a solution of biotinylated BSA (Pierce) resuspended to 2 mg/ml in dH2O for
30 min through all channels, followed by a 10 min PBS wash. Next a 500 mg/ml
neutravidin (Pierce) solution in PBS was Ô¨Çowed for 20 min, followed by a
10 min PBS wash. Next, the button membrane was closed and the PBS wash
continued for an additional 5 min. Then all remaining accessible surface area
except for the circular area of 60 mm masked by the button was passivated with
the same biotinylated solution as above for 30 min, followed by a 10 min PBS
wash. Finally a 1:1 solution ofbiotinylated-5-histidine antibody (Qiagen) in 2%
BSA in PBS was loaded for 2‚Äì5 min, after which the button membrane was
opened and Ô¨Çow continued for 20 min allowing speciÔ¨Åc functionalization of
the previously masked circular area. This was again followed by a 10 min PBS
wash completing the surface derivatization procedure.

Protein synthesis and MITOMI. Next a standard 25 ml TNT T7‚Äìcoupled
wheat germ extract mixture (Promega) was prepared and spiked with 1 ml
tRNALys-bodipy-Ô¨Ç (Promega) and 2 ml of plasmid DNA template coding for
the appropriate protein (HuR, HuD or Gus). The mixture was immediately
loaded into the device and Ô¨Çushed for 5 min, after which the chamber valves
were opened allowing for dead-end Ô¨Ålling of the chambers with wheat germ
extract. The chamber valves were again closed and Ô¨Çushing continued for an
additional 5 min. Next the segregation valves separating each unit cell were
closed followed by opening of the chamber valves allowing for equilibration of
the unit cell by diffusion. The entire device was heated to 30 1C on a
temperature-controlled microscope stage and incubated for up to 90 min to
complete protein synthesis, binding of protein to the surface-bound biotiny-
lated-5-histidine antibody, solvation of target RNA, and equilibration of
proteins and target RNA. MITOMI was then performed by closing the button
membrane as well as the chamber valves allowing trapping surface-bound
complexes while expelling any solution phase molecules. Radial closure pre-
vents solvent pockets from forming between the two interfaces and effectively
creates zero dead volume while preserving the equilibrium concentrations of
the molecular interactions. This was followed by a 5 min PBS wash to remove
untrapped unbound material. The device was then imaged on a modiÔ¨Åed
arrayWoRxe (AppliedPrecision) microarray scanner to detect protein synthesis
and the trapped molecules.

Image and data analysis. All

images were analyzed with GenePix3.0
(Molecular Devices). For each experiment an image was taken after MITOMI
and the Ô¨Ånal PBS wash. This was used to determine the concentration of
surface-bound protein (FITC channel) as well as surface-bound target RNA
(Cy3 channel). Each unit cell generated a single data point that consisted of the
ratio of median signal of Cy3 to median signal of bodipy; thus, representing the
ratio of surface-bound RNA to surface-bound expressed protein. Data from
multiple data points were averaged and their s.d. calculated. Results were then
normalized to 1. Between 10 and 20 replicates were included for each probe
tested. A control protein, Gus-his (Roche) was included in each experiment and
subjected to the same analysis. When present, detected signal with Gus-his was
used for background subtraction.

For membrane-associated proteins. Detection of RNA binding by NS4B
was done as described except for the following modiÔ¨Åcations. NS4B was
expressed off
the microÔ¨Çuidic device by using a coupled transcription/
translation rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega). We added 2 ml canine
microsomal membranes (Promega) to the reaction mixture to allow appro-
priate protein folding. An NS4B-GFP construct was used thus eliminating
the need for tRNALys bodipy Ô¨Ç in the reaction mixture. A biotinylated
anti-GFP antibody (Abcam) was used to speciÔ¨Åcally functionalize the
protected circular area deÔ¨Åned by the button. The protein was anchored to
the chip via its interaction with the surface-bound anti-GFP antibodies.
The surface-bound protein and the Cy5-labeled HCV RNA probes were loaded
into the chip and allowed to incubate for 5‚Äì20 min in a 50-mM HEPES KOH

(pH 6.8) buffer. Next, MITOMI was performed followed by a brief wash in
HEPES KOH (pH 6.8) buffer. The device was then scanned and results
quantiÔ¨Åed as described above. NS4B-GFP mutants and NS5A(AH)-GFP were
assayed the same way. Signal detected with NS5A(AH)-GFP was used for
background subtraction.

Screening of inhibitory compound library. The 1,280 compounds of the
Lopac library (Sigma) solubilized in DMSO were spotted onto epoxy-coated
glass substrates slide by OmniGrid Micro microarrayer using a CMP3B pin as a
microarray. For the primary screen compounds were spotted at a high
concentration (B1 mM) in duplicates. The array was allowed to dry and
was then aligned and bonded to a microÔ¨Çuidic device. Two large devices
(2,400 unit cells per device) were used for the primary screen. The rest of the
procedure was done similarly to the described above (RNA binding assay). In
brief, the device was subjected to surface patterning that resulted in a circular
area coated with biotinylated anti-GFP antibodies within each unit cell. Next,
NS4B-GFP expressed off chip using coupled transcription/translation rabbit
reticulocyte system in the presence of microsomal membranes was loaded
into the chip and bound to the surface biotinylated anti-GFP antibodies.
Cy5-labeled 3¬¢ neg terminus RNA probe was then loaded at a concentration of
1.5 nM. Each unit cell was then isolated followed by a 30 min incubation to
allow binding of the protein to surface-biotinylated anti-GFP antibodies,
solvation of library compounds, and equilibration of proteins and target
RNA. Next, MITOMI was performed trapping surface-bound complexes while
expelling any solution phase molecules. After a brief wash to remove untrapped
unbound material the device was scanned and results analyzed. The ratio of
bound RNA to expressed protein was calculated for each data point by
measuring the median signal of Cy3 to median signal of bodipy. Results were
normalized to signal measured in unit cells containing no inhibitory com-
pound. Greater than 90% inhibition was deÔ¨Åned as the cutoff for inhibition in
the primary screen; 104 compounds which were above this cutoff and an
additional 110 yielding ambiguous results were subjected to a secondary screen.
This was performed similarly, except that two smaller devices (640 unit cells per
each) were used; the spotted compound concentration was 10-fold lower
than in the primary screen, and Ô¨Åve replicates were spotted for each compound.
Inhibition 42.5 fold was considered signiÔ¨Åcant. 18 compounds identiÔ¨Åed
in this screen were further analyzed for their inhibitory effect on HCV
RNA replication.

Determination of IC50 for in vitro RNA binding. For an accurate measure-
ment of IC50s, serial dilutions of the inhibitory compound were loaded onto
the microÔ¨Çuidic device by continuous Ô¨Çow while maintaining a steady con-
centration of the compound in the Ô¨Çow channel. This helped to avoid losses of
the spotted compounds from incomplete solubilization and/or binding of the
compound to PDMS. The experiment was performed essentially as described in
the RNA binding assay for transmembrane proteins except that the expressed
protein and the Cy5-labeled HCV RNA probes were incubated in the device in
the presence of the inhibitory compounds or their absence. IC50s were
measured as described in the statistical analysis section below.

Expression and puriÔ¨Åcation of recombinant NS4B. GST-NS4B and GST were
expressed in E. coli BL21 and puriÔ¨Åed as described elsewhere11. NS4B was fused
in frame with an N-terminal 6his-MISTIC protein (membrane-integrating
sequence for translation of IM protein constructs)35. Overnight cultures of
E. coli transformed with mistic-NS4B plasmid were diluted 1:100 in 400 ml of
fresh medium and grown at 37 1C to an OD of 0.8. IPTG (Invitrogen) was then
added to a Ô¨Ånal concentration of 0.1 mM. After 3 h growth at 37 1C cells were
pelleted and resuspended in 30cml lysis buffer (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris HCL
(pH8), 100 mM imidazole, 10 mM decylmaltoside, Complete EDTA-free
protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were lysed by one cycle in
a French Press at a pressure of 10,000 p.s.i. for 1 min, followed by centrifugation
at 12,000g for 5 min at 4 1C. The supernatant was loaded on a nickel column
(Amersham). After washes, protein was eluted in a buffer containing 400 mM
imidazole. Glycerol was added at a Ô¨Ånal concentration of 20% and samples
were stored at ‚Äì20 1C. PuriÔ¨Åcation was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Total protein
concentration was measured using the RC-DC assay (Bio-Rad). NS4B-mistic
was identiÔ¨Åed by western blot analyses using monoclonal antibodies against

6-his (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and NS4B (Virostat). 6his-mistic was
expressed and puriÔ¨Åed in a similar manner.

GST pull-down assay. Similar to a previously described strategy36, 1 mg of
puriÔ¨Åed GST-NS4B or GST was incubated for 1 h at 37 1C in a 50 ml reaction
mixture containing 32P-labeled in vitro‚Äìtranscribed HCV RNA (corresponding
to the 3¬¢ terminus of the negative viral strand) and binding buffer (10 mM
DTT, 10 mM Na HEPES (pH 7.4), 33 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM
MgCl2). We then added 50 ml oftRNA precoated glutathione-agarose beads
(Sigma), followed by 1 h incubation at 4 1C to allow binding of GST to the
beads. The beads were then washed three times in binding buffer and bound
RNA was measured by liquid scintillation counting of sample aliquots. Control
incubations with an RNA probe prepared in the absence of T7 RNA polymerase
were used for background subtraction.

RNA Ô¨Ålter binding assay. Assays were performed essentially as described34.
BrieÔ¨Çy, various concentrations of mistic-NS4B protein or mistic control were
incubated for 1 h at 30 1C with 3.3 nM 32P-labeled in vitro‚Äìtranscribed HCV
RNA probe in binding buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM
MgCl2, 10 ng/ml tRNA and 0.2 mM decylmaltoside) in a Ô¨Ånal volume of 40 ml.
Membranes were presoaked in the binding buffer and assembled in a dot-blot
apparatus (Schleicher & Schull) from top to bottom as follows: nitrocellulose
(Biorad), Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences), Whatman 3-mm Ô¨Ålter paper.
The binding reactions were loaded onto the dot-blot apparatus and Ô¨Åltered
through the membranes. After washing, the membranes were air-dried and
visualized by phospho-imaging. Results represent percentage of bound RNA
calculated by dividing the signal detected in the nitrocellulose membrane by the
sum of the signals detected in the nitrocellulose and the Hybond membranes.

Cell culture and electroporation. Huh7.5 cells were maintained in DMEM
(Gibco) supplemented with 1% L-glutamine (Gibco), 1% penicillin, 1%
streptomycin (Gibco), 1 nonessential amino acids (Gibco) and 10% FBS
(Omega ScientiÔ¨Åc). Cell lines were passaged twice weekly after treatment with
0.05% trypsin‚Äì0.02% EDTA and seeding at a dilution of 1:5. SubconÔ¨Çuent
Huh7.5 cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation at 700g for 5 min.
The cells were then washed three times in ice-cold RNase-free PBS (BioWhit-
taker) and resuspended at 1.5  107 cells/ml in PBS. Wild-type or mutant
FL-J6/JFH-5¬¢C19Rluc2AUbi RNA for electroporation was generated by in vitro
transcription of XbaI-linearized DNA templates using the T7 MEGAscript kit
(Ambion), followed by puriÔ¨Åcation, essentially as described above (in vitro
RNA transcription and Ô¨Çuorescent labeling). We mixed 5 mg of RNA with
400 ml of washed Huh7.5 cells in a 2-mm-gap cuvette (BTX) and immediately
pulsed (0.82 kV, Ô¨Åve 99 ms pulses) with a BTX-830 electroporator. After a
10 min recovery at 25 1C, pulsed cells were diluted into 10 ml of prewarmed
growth medium. Cells from several electroporations were pooled to a common
stock and seeded in 6-well plates (5  105 cells per well). After 24 h, medium
was replaced and cells were grown in the presence of serial dilutions of the
various inhibitory compounds (Sigma) identiÔ¨Åed in the screen. Seventeen
commercially available compounds, out of the 18 identiÔ¨Åed, were analyzed.
Untreated cells were used as a negative control for water-soluble compounds.
For compounds solubilized in DMSO, untreated cells were grown in the
presence of corresponding concentrations of the solvent as a negative control.
Medium was changed daily. After 72 h of treatment cells were subjected to an
Alamar Blue‚Äìbased viability assay and luciferase assay.

Viability assay. After 72 h of treatment cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 1C in
the presence of 10% Alamar Blue reagent (TREK Diagnostic Systems). Plates
were then scanned and Ô¨Çuorescence was detected by using FLEXstation II 384
(Molecular Devices). Depending on the inhibitory compound‚Äôs solvent, water
or DMSO, signal was normalized relatively to untreated samples or samples
grown in the presence of DMSO, respectively.

Luciferase assay. Viral RNA replication was determined using Renilla luciferase
assay (Promega). The same samples subjected to the viability assay described
above were analyzed in this assay. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and
scraped off the plate into 250 ml of ice-cold Renilla lysis buffer according to the
manufacturer‚Äôs protocol. We then loaded 20 ml of the cell lysates onto 96-well
plates. We injected 100 ml of the Renilla luciferase assay buffer containing the

assay substrate and measured luciferase activity using a Berthold LB 96 V
luminometer. As above, signal was normalized relative to untreated samples or
samples grown in the presence of the corresponding concentration of DMSO.
Luciferase activity detected in samples treated with 100 u/ml interferon a B2
(PBL Biomedical Labs) was used as a positive control, demonstrating three log
reduction at 72 h treatment. The experiment was repeated four times, each time
with triplicates. IC50s were measured by Ô¨Åtting data to a three-parameter
logistic curve using the formula Y ¬º a+(b ‚Äì a)/(1 + 10^(X ‚Äì c)) (BioDataFit,
Chang Bioscience).
Real-time PCR. 5  104 Huh7.5 ells were infected with cell culture-grown HCV
titered at 1.4  104 TCID50/ml, as described29. Two hours after infection, cells
were washed three times in culture medium. Cells were then treated daily with
various concentrations of clemizole. After 72 h samples were subjected to the
viability assay described above, following which TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen)
was added and total cell RNA was extracted in triplicates according to the
manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Reverse transcription was then performed using
random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-
time PCR was performed on the resulting cDNA to quantify the amounts of
HCV and actin RNA (in separate reactions) in each sample. Standards were
made using an in vitro-transcribed HCV RNA and human actin standard
(Applied Biosystems). HCV was quantiÔ¨Åed using primers AGAGCCATAG
TGGTCT and CCAAATCTCCAGGCATTGAGC and probe 6-carboxyÔ¨Çuores-
cein-CACCGGAATTGCCAGGACGACCGG-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine.
Actin was quantiÔ¨Åed using beta-actin control reagents (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. HCV RNA level was adjusted to
actin level and normalized relative to untreated samples.

Selection of resistant mutants. Established HCV replicon-harboring cells and
Huh7 cells electroporated de novo with a genotype 1b subgenomic HCV
replicon (Bart 79I)30 were passaged in the presence of neomycin and increasing
concentration of clemizole (1-16 mM). Colonies that were able to grow in the
presence of the compound were isolated and propagated for 5‚Äì10 passages.
Eleven colonies (out of B60) survived the passages and were subjected to
sequence analysis, as previously described11.

Whole-cell RNA electroporation. Whole-cell RNA was extracted from clem-
izole-resistant replicon clones and from untreated replicon cells using TRIzol
reagent. Equal amounts of whole cell RNA (50 mg) were electroporated into
Huh7.5 cells, as described above. Cells were grown under G418 selection
in the presence or absence of clemizole for 3 weeks. The number of colonies
was determined using Image J (National Institutes of Health) following Ô¨Åxation
and staining with crystal violet.

Statistical analysis. Dissociation equilibrium constants were determined by
Ô¨Åtting data to the equation describing equilibrium binding; Y ¬º a  X/(b + X)
(a and b represent maximum binding and Kd, respectively) by nonlinear least-
squares regression Ô¨Åtting (BioDataFit, Chang Bioscience). IC50s were measured
by Ô¨Åtting data to a three-parameter logistic curve using the formula Y ¬º a +
(b ‚Äì a)/(1 + 10^(X ‚Äì c)) (a, b and c represent minimum binding, maximum
binding and logEC50, respectively)(BioDataFit, Chang Bioscience).
