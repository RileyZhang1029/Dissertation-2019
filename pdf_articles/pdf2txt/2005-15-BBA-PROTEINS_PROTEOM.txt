Abstract

Calcineurin (CN), a Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase, is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic
subunit (CNA) and a regulatory subunit (CNB). The activity of CNA is under the control of two functionally distinct, but structurally similar
Ca2+-regulated proteins, CaM and CNB. The crystal structure of the holoenzyme reveals that the N-terminus and C-terminus of CNB and the
N-terminus of CNA each have a long arm not involved in the active site. We constructed a fusion of the genes of CaM, CNB and CNA in that
order using linker primers containing six and ten codons of glycine. A single-chain CaM–CNB–CNA (CBA) complex was expressed and
purified to near homogeneity. The single-chain complex was fully soluble, and had biochemical properties and kinetic parameters similar to
single-chain CNB–CNA (BA) activated by CaM. It was not regulated by CaM and CNB, but was strongly stimulated by Mn2+, Ni2+ and
Mg2+. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy of the complex showed a change in the environment of tryptophan in the presence of Ca2+ and
circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry revealed an increase in alpha-helical content. Our findings suggest that fusion of CaM, CNB and
CNA does not prevent the structural changes required for their functioning; in particular, CaM within the complex could still interact
correctly with CN in the presence of Ca2+.

1. Introduction

Calcineurin (CN), or protein phosphatase-2B (PP-2B),
belongs to a family of serine/threonine phosphatases includ-
ing protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) and protein phosphatase-
2A (PP-2A), and is the only calmodulin (CaM)-regulated
to dual control by two Ca2+-regulated
enzyme subject
proteins, CaM and the calcineurin B subunit (CNB) [1–3].
The structure of CN is conserved in all eukaryotes, from yeast
to man [4]. Biochemical and genetic studies have identified

four distinct functional domains in calcineurin A (CNA): a
catalytic domain, a CNB binding domain (BBH), a CaM
binding domain, and an autoinhibitory (AI) domain [5,6].
CNB binds four calcium ions and has 35% sequence identity
with CaM, and it is tightly bound to the enzyme even at low
Ca2+ concentration [7]. The site of interaction of CaM for CN,
as well as for myosin light chain kinase, is highly extended
and may include hydrophobic pockets at homologous sites
near the carboxy-terminal ends of the two halves of the
molecule [8]. In addition, CN requires a divalent metal ion for
structural stability and full activity towards either the
nonprotein substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) or the
phosphoprotein substrates. Mg2+ and the transition metals
Mn2+ and Ni2+ are the most potent CN activators [9].

In recent years, several milestones in the determination of
the three-dimensional structure have been achieved by X-
ray diffraction methods [10–12], and key amino acids
affecting the structure and function of CN have been

identified by site-directed mutagenesis [13–15]. At present,
the three-dimensional structure of CN in complex with CaM
remains unknown, and the published crystal structure of CN
is also incomplete. Based on previous experimental results
[16] and the crystal structure of CN, we have created a
fusion of CN and CaM, in which the components retain their
interaction sites. Since CaM and CNB are indispensable for
investigating the structure and function of CNA, we have
asked whether the single-chain complex CaM–CNB–CNA
can provide the functions of both CN and CaM? This paper
answers that question. In addition, we report that a V314
deletion mutant of single-chain CN significantly alters its
phosphatase activity.

Recent advances in protein engineering of a variety of
proteins have come from creating multi-functional mod-
ular chimeric proteins. The modules are typically joined
via an oligopeptide linker, the correct design of which is
crucial for activity of the chimeric protein [17]. Fusion
proteins have been mainly used to solve problems
regarding stability, solubility and membrane anchoring.
It is known that CNA is unstable in the absence of CNB
[3], and soluble monomers of CN are currently obtained
by using double promoters or an SD sequence to
coexpress the two subunits, but
insufficient
to overcome the solubility problem [14]. The construction
of a single-chain complex could solve the problem of
aggregation of CNA expressed in E. coli, and throw light
on the aggregation mechanism.

with 10 codons (in italics) for glycine. To ensure the fidelity
of the PCR reaction, a pyrobest DNA polymerase was used
for all PCR amplifications. The restriction enzyme EcoRI
whose recognition site is present only in the sequence of CNB
was selected to digest the two fusion genes, CaM–CNB and
CNB–CNA. When the two fragments, CaM–CNBN and
CNBC–CNA, were ligated, we obtained the full-length CBA
fusion. All the genes of interest and the blank vector pET21a
were digested with NdeI and BamHI, and positive recombi-
nant colonies harboring the fusion genes were obtained after
ligation, transformation and plasmid screening.

2.2. Protein expression

A single colony of E. coli

strain BL21 (DE3)/
pETCBA from a fresh plate (less than 1 week old)
was inoculated into 50 mL of LB containing 100 Ag/mL
ampicillin (amp) and incubated with shaking at 37 8C
overnight,
then used to inoculate 1 L of TM (amp).
When A600 reached 1.0, IPTG was added to 0.1 mM,
and the culture was shaken continuously at 25 8C for 16
h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2200g
for 10 min and washed once with 50 mL of prechilled
buffer A (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA). All
subsequent purification steps were carried out at 4 8C.
The cell pellet was weighed, resuspended (at 5 mL/g of
wet pellet) in buffer A with 0.2 mM PMSF and 20 mM
h-mercaptoethanol, and lysed ultrasonically. The enzymes

obtained by centrifugation at 14,600g for 30 min were
then purified.

2.3. Protein purification

We used the double-PCR to generate DNA products with
5V NdeI and 3V BamHI sticky ends. The gene for CNB was
amplified from the pETB vector using a 5V primer (5V-
CCGCCATATGGGAAATGAGGCGAGTT-3V) tagged with
an NdeI (underlined) site, and a 3V primer (5V-ACCACCAC-
CACCGCCACCCACATCTACCACCATCTT-3V) tagged
with six codons (in italics) for glycine. The genes for CNA
and its V314 deletion mutant were amplified from pET
vectors containing the corresponding wild-type and mutant
gene using a 5V primer (5V-GGTGGCGGTGGTGGT-
GGTATGTCCGAGCCCAAGGCG-3V) tagged with six
codons (in italics) for glycine, and a 3V primer (5V-
CGCGGGATCCTCACTGAATATTGCTGC-3V)
tagged
with a BamHI site (underlined). In the first PCR we cons-
tructed a full-length fusion from the PCR fragments of CNB
and CNA (or its mutant) using the 5V primer of CNB and the
3Vprimer of CNA for amplification. To form the CaM–CNB–
CNA complex, we first amplified the fusion of CaM–CNB
using a pair of linker primers (5V-GGTGGTGGTGGC-

Ammonium sulfate powder was added to 45% satu-
ration to a small beaker containing the stirred supernatant.
The solution was stirred for another 20 min followed by
centrifugation at 14,600g for 30 min. The protein pellet
was dissolved in 15 mL of buffer B (50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.4, 0.2 mM PMSF, 20 mM h-mercaptoethanol) with
5 mM CaCl2. Fifteen milliliters of the dissolved protein
pellet and 15 mL of phenyl-Sepharose resin equilibrated
with buffer B and 0.5 mM CaCl2 were mixed in a small
beaker and stirred slowly (200 rpm) with a glass rotor for
40 min. The stirred mixture was loaded onto a column
and washed with 300 mL of buffer B and 0.5 mM CaCl2
for 2 h. The column was then eluted with 200 mL of
buffer C (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2
mM PMSF, 20 mM h-mercaptoethanol), and 15-mL
fractions were collected. After a second ammonium
sulfate precipitation,
the protein pellet was dissolved in
2 mL of buffer D (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.2 mM
EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM PMSF, 20 mM h-
mercaptoethanol). Two milliliters of the dissolved protein
pellet was loaded onto a superdex 200 prep grade column

equilibrated with buffer D and monitored by FPLC
(Pharmacia), and 5-mL fractions collected. The fractions
were frozen and dried, and the purity of the proteins was
analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The enzyme was stored at
 20 8C. BA and its V314 deletion mutant were also
purified as described by Qin et al. [16].

2.4. Assay of phosphatase activity

The assay for activity on p-nitrophenyl phosphate as
substrate with Mn2+ as activator was performed in 50 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), 1 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin
(BSA), and 20 mM pNPP. When Ni2+ was used as
activator, MnCl2 was replaced with NiCl2. Reactions were
performed in 0.2-ml volumes at 30 8C for 10 min and
terminated by adding 1.8-ml 0.5 M sodium carbonate.
The absorbance was read at 410 nm. A molar extinction
 1 was used to convert
coefficient of 17,800 M
absorbance values into molar concentrations, and relative
specific activity was converted to nmol/(mind mg). Protein
phosphatase activity was assayed by release of 32Pi from
32P-labeled RII peptide (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE)
labeled with [g-32P] ATP as described by Perrino et al.
[18]. The standard assay mixture (20 AL) was the same as
for the p-nitrophenyl phosphate assay except that 20 mM
of pNPP was replaced by 20 AM 32P-RII. Units of
activity were nanomoles of [32Pi] released per minute per
milligram of enzyme.

2.5. CD spectropolarimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy

CD experiments were performed on a CD instrument
(Jasco J-720, Japan) calibrated with d10-camphorsulfonic
acid. All spectra were recorded at 20 8C with constant N2
flushing. The scans were recorded using a bandwidth of
1.0 nm and an integration time of 4 s at a scan rate of 50
nm/min. All measurements were performed for 10 min
after sample preparation using a 1-mm spectral path
length and the spectra were corrected using a buffer blank
containing 50 mM Tris–HCl. Fluorescence measurements
were performed with a spectrofluorimeter (FluoroMax-2,

America) at 20 8C in a thermostated cell holder with a 1-
mm path-length quartz cell. Bandwidths of 5 nm were
used for excitation and emission beams, and the excitation
wavelength was fixed at 280 nm. Emission spectra were
recorded from 285 to 450 nm at a scan rate of 60 nm/
min. Each maximum emission wavelength (kmax) repre-
sents the average of five measurements.

3. Results

3.1. Molecular cloning of CBA and BA cDNAs

The fusion of the CBA genes in the order CaM, CNB
and CNA was constructed with two pairs of linker primers
containing six and ten codons of glycine, respectively
(Fig. 1A). A fusion of BA and its V314 mutant was also
constructed, as described in Materials and methods (Fig.
1B). All fusion fragment cDNAs were cloned into the
expression vector pET-21a using the same NdeI/BamHI
restriction site, and transformed into the expression vector
E. coli BL21 (DE3). All the recombinant plasmids were
identified by digestion with NdeI and BamHI, and
confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown).

3.2. Gel filtration analysis of CBA, BA and CNA

We examined the gel filtration behavior of CBA, BA
and CNA with a superdex 200 prep grade column. CNA
expressed in E. coli existed mostly as an aggregate, as
judged by the position of the elution peak (Fig. 2A). The
gel filtration chromatogram of BA contained two elution

it represented a
BA monomer. BA without the linker appeared to form the
same monomer, but
there was a small aggregate peak
immediately before the monomer (Fig. 2B), implying that
deletion of the linker between CNA and CNB affected
the solubility of

behaved entirely as a monomer (Fig. 2D), indicating that

problem.

formants were purified to near-homogeneity by phenyl-

Yields of CBA, BA and the mutant were up to 20 mg/l of
culture.

3.4. Analysis of the phosphatase activities

The phosphatase activity of CBA was not affected by
the addition of CaM or CNB, and its constitutive activity
to that of BA when activated by CaM
was equivalent
(Fig. 4A). The basal activity of
the V314 deletion
derivative of BA was also significantly elevated and the
effect of CaM on it was correspondingly decreased. We
also measured the phosphatase activities of the recombi-
nant proteins towards the 32P-RII-peptide. CBA was again
not regulated by added CaM (Fig. 4B). The basal activity
of the mutant was increased, but the regulatory effect of
CaM on it was essentially unchanged.

3.5. Determination of the Km and Vmax of CBA

The kinetic constants Km and Vmax reflect, respectively,
the affinity and catalytic activity of the enzyme for its
substrate. We measured the Km and Vmax of CBA with various
concentrations of pNPP and calculated their values from

3.6. Effect of divalent metal ions

Calcineurin is a metalloenzyme and Mn2+, Ni2+ and
Mg2+ are important activators. We used final concentra-
tions of MnCl2 and NiCl2 from 0 to 10 mM, and of Mg2+
from 0 to 100 mM to determine the effects of the divalent
metal
ions on CBA. Activity increased markedly over
these concentration ranges reaching maxima at 1, 5, and
100 mM, respectively. The order of effectiveness was:
Mg2+NNi2+NMn2+ (Fig. 6).

3.7. Solution conformation analysis

We examined the fluorescence spectra of CaM and
CBA in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Emission was
maximal at 304 and 340 nm,
respectively, and the

4. Discussion

Many cellular processes involve proteins with multiple
domains. The linkers between domains play an essential role
in maintaining cooperative inter-domain interactions and
stabilizing the tertiary structure of the proteins [19]. Argos
[20] carried out a statistical analysis of natural linkers with
the aim of designing linkers for gene fusions with a low
likelihood of disrupting the folding of the flanking domains.
However, few successful cases of fusion have been reported
for proteins with a quaternary structure, or for pairs of
proteins with spatial interaction sites. Based on information
from the crystal structure of CN and previous experimental
results, we constructed a single-chain calcineurin–calm-
odulin complex. The complex was not regulated by addi-
tional CaM or CNB, but was still strongly stimulated by
Mg2+, Mn2+ and Ni2+; it was functionally equivalent to the
linked enzyme BA with added CaM. This showed that
fusion of CaM, CNB and CNA did not affect their folding or

the structural changes required for their functioning. CD and
fluorescence spectra showed that the conformation of CBA
in solution changed in the presence of Ca2+, indicating that
Ca2+ can bind to CaM within the complex, and that the
Ca2+-loaded CaM can interact correctly with CN.

An obvious feature by which CN differs from other
members of the serine/threonine phosphatase family is the
regulation of its activity by CaM. Loop 7 of CNA is
positioned where substrates enter
the binuclear metal
centers, and the V314 residue is in the center of loop 7.
We constructed a V314 deletion mutant of BA and found
that it had increased phosphatase activity, consistent with
the findings of Yan and Wei [15].

We have further validated the technique of forming
single-chain proteins. Many studies of the linker peptides of
a number of protein families have concluded that linkers
lack regular secondary structure, but display various degrees
of flexibility to match their particular purpose [21,22]. Since
glycine is more flexible than the other amino acids, we
designed an oligopeptide containing 10 glycines as linkers
between CN and CaM in the hope of providing a larger gap
with more flexibility for achieving the correct spatial
interaction after the addition of Ca2+. The experimental
results justified this approach.

CaM activated BA to similar extents with or without the
flexible linkers, and their specific activities were alike,
showing that the fusion and linker insertion did not alter the
affinity or catalytic activity of the enzyme. However, BA
without linkers was strongly aggregated during gel filtra-
tion, demonstrating that although the enzymatic activity of
BA did not require the linkers, the hydrophobic interaction
between CNA and CNB was disturbed. The covalent bond
between the two subunits presumably caused a greater
traction resistance to their interaction owing to the absence
of a flexible linker. Some exposure of hydrophobic regions
is likely to be the cause of the severe aggregation. There is
overlap (linker region) between the domains of the native
protein, and the interaction and information transfer between
domains depend on the structure of the linker and the
function of the different domains. Therefore, we believe that
the selection of a suitable linker is indispensable for creating
a desired protein fusion, in order to meet the requirements of
the internal mechanism of that protein.

is that

One disadvantage of expressing heterologous proteins in
the expressed proteins frequently form
E. coli
aggregated folding intermediates, known as inclusion bodies
[23]. The individual expression of the two subunits of CN in
E. coli usually resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies
and soluble aggregates, and coexpression of
the two
to overcome this solubility
subunits was not sufficient
problem. We analyzed the solubility of the CBA, BA and
CNA by gel filtration and found that CNA existed mostly as
aggregates, BA formed some monomers, and CBA was
completely monomeric. These results suggested that the two
hydrophobic sites on CNA, the CNB and CaM binding
domains, were essentially responsible for the formation of
aggregation. When the two hydrophobic regions were
shielded stepwise by constructing BA and CBA, soluble
monomers were expressed in E. coli.

Maximal activation of CN requires excessive CaM,
whereas CBA has a molar ratio of 1:1:1 between CaM,
CNB and CAN. Additional CaM did not
increase the
activity of CBA; instead there was a slight decrease of
activity. Presumably in the absence of Ca2+,
the CaM
module in CBA can only rotate around the holoenzyme
molecule in a radius of the 10 glycines, on account of
restriction by the covalent bond. The cumulative length of
the nine peptide bond planes ensures that CaM and its target
module are close enough for effective interaction. This is
equivalent to increasing the effective local concentration of
CaM. Following the addition of Ca2+, the conformation of
CaM changes, and it interacts with its target molecule. The
additional CaM may interfere with this interaction, thus
causing a slight decrease in activity.
