SUMMARY

Dormant seeds are capable of remaining alive in the hydrated state for extended periods of time without losing
vigor, until environmental cues or after-ripening result in the release of dormancy. Here, we investigated the
possible role of the regulatory subunit of the sucrose non-fermenting-related kinase complex, MtSNF4b, in
dormancy of Medicago truncatula seeds. Expression of MtSNF4b and its involvement in a high-molecular-
weight complex are found in dormant seeds, whereas imbibition of fully after-ripened, non-dormant seeds
leads to dissociation of the complex. MtSNF4b is capable of complementing the yeast Dsnf4 mutant and of
interacting with the MtSnRK1 a-subunit in a double hybrid system. Transcriptome analyses on freshly
harvested and after-ripened RNAi Mtsnf4b and wild-type embryos implicate MtSNF4b in the defense response
in hydrated dormant embryonic tissues, affecting the expression of genes encoding enzymes of ﬂavonoid and
phenylpropanoid metabolism, WRKY transcription factors and pathogenesis-related proteins. Silencing
MtSNF4b also increased the speed of after-ripening during dry storage, an effect that appears to be related to a
change in base water potential. No signiﬁcant difference in ABA content or sensitivity was detected between
mutant and wild-type seeds. Pharmacological studies using hexoses and sugar analogs revealed that mannose
restored germination behavior and expression of the genes PAL, CHR and IFR in RNAi Mtsnf4b seeds towards
that of the wild-type, suggesting that MtSNF4b might act upstream of sugar-sensing pathways. Overall, the
results suggest that MtSNF4b participates in regulation of a constitutively activated defense response in
hydrated, dormant seeds.

Keywords: SNF4b, seeds, Medicago truncatula, dormancy, biotic stress.

INTRODUCTION

The end of seed development is characterized by termina-
tion of seed ﬁlling, a decrease in seed water content and
progressive arrest of metabolism. During this ﬁnal phase,
seeds such as those of Medicago truncatula acquire the
ability to survive the dry state for long periods of time, also
referred to as longevity, and enter into a dormant state.
Dormancy is a genetically and environmentally determined
developmental state that is imposed during imbibition of
freshly harvested seeds, during which metabolism is active,
but growth processes are repressed (Finch-Savage and
Leubner-Metzger, 2006; Bradford and Nonogaki, 2007).

time without

Dormancy is gradually lost during the time-dependent
process of after-ripening (AR) that occurs in the dry seed. In
the dormant state, seeds are capable of remaining hydrated
for extended periods of
losing vigor
(Finch-Savage and Leubner-Metzger, 2006; Bradford and
Nonogaki, 2007). In addition, ﬂuctuations of environmental
conditions will cause the seeds to undergo hydration and
dehydration cycles in the soil, which they can do without
losing their ability to germinate. Dormant seeds have
developed an array of protective mechanisms in order to
remain viable until environmental cues are provided to

MtSNF4b enhances the biotic stress response in dormant seeds 793

The sucrose non-fermenting related kinase (SnRK1) is
known for its central role in energy metabolism, linking
stress, sugar and developmental signals to regulate plant
metabolism, energy balance, growth and stress responses
(Schwachtje et al., 2006; Ananieva et al., 2008; Baena-
Gonzalez and Sheen, 2008). The complex has also been
shown to play a role during seed maturation, affecting
accumulation of storage proteins and occasionally leading
to precocious germination (Radchuk et al., 2006; Rosnoblet
et al., 2007). The SnRK1 complex comprises an auto-inhib-
itory catalytic a subunit that is activated upon interaction
with two other non-catalytic subunits, a b subunit (SnRKb),
which has been suggested to play an essential role in
subcellular localization and the speciﬁcity of recognition
between the kinase complex and its targets, and a c subunit
(SNF4/SnRKc), which is thought to regulate the activity of
the complex (Halford et al., 2000; Kleinow et al., 2000).
Several regulatory b and c subunits exist in plants, and are
differentially regulated at the transcriptional level according
to stress and developmental stage (Bouly et al., 1999;
Buitink et al., 2004). In seeds, several SnRKb and SnRKc
subunits are co-expressed, suggesting co-existence of sev-
eral SnRK1 complexes formed by different regulatory
subunits (Buitink et al., 2004). This might explain the strong
pleiotropic effects observed when the catalytic subunit is
down-regulated (Radchuk et al., 2006; Baena-Gonzalez and
Sheen, 2008).

The expression of one subgroup of SnRKc subunits, Pv42/
LeSNF4/MtSNF4b,
is correlated with the ﬁnal stage of
maturation, when longevity and dormancy are acquired
(Bradford et al., 2003; Buitink et al., 2004). MtSNF4b is
expressed in parallel with the induction of desiccation
tolerance, and its silencing affects oligosaccharide metabo-
lism and longevity during maturation (Bradford et al., 2003;
Rosnoblet et al., 2007). LeSNF4 transcripts are ABA-induc-
ible in tomato seeds, and their accumulation is linked to the
inability of seeds to germinate, with levels remaining high
when radicle protrusion is blocked by ABA, water stress,
far-red light or dormancy (Bradford et al., 2003).

In this study, we investigated the possible role of
MtSNF4b in seed germination and dormancy of M. trunca-
tula seeds. We show that MtSNF4b expression and complex
formation are related to the AR status of the imbibed seeds.
A transcriptomic analysis on imbibed mutant and wild-type
embryos demonstrated that MtSNF4b silencing reduces
gene expression related to biotic stress and secondary
metabolism in dormant embryonic tissues. Silencing
MtSNF4b also increased the speed of AR independently of
ABA. A role of sugar sensing pathways downstream of
SnRK1/SNF4b is suggested by the observation that man-
nose both delays germination and increases PAL, CHR and
IFR expression in RNAi Mtsnf4b seeds. The results suggest

RESULTS

MtSNF4b expression and complex formation are related
to dormancy

To investigate the role of MtSNF4b in dormancy of
M. truncatula seeds, we ﬁrst characterized its dormancy
behavior. Seeds of M. truncatula do not germinate readily
under optimal conditions when imbibed 4 days after har-
vest, and exhibit non-deep dormancy comparable to that of
Nicotiana plumbaginifolia (Grappin et al., 2000; Faria et al.,
2005) (Figure 1a). Subsequent storage of freshly harvested
seeds under controlled, dry conditions led to the gradual
release of dormancy, referred to as AR, and a concomitant
increase in germination speed (Figure 1a). Seeds that are
imbibed after two weeks of AR take 10–14 days to germinate
at 20°C in the dark, whereas breaking of dormancy either by
one year of AR or an incipient cold imbibition (48 h at 4°C)
results in a seed population that germinates within 24 h
under similar imbibition conditions. Incubation in ﬂuridone
to block ABA and carotenoid synthesis released dormancy
and increased the germination speed such that it was com-
parable with that of fully after-ripened seeds (Figure 1a). To
investigate whether MtSNF4b gene expression is regulated

Previous studies using yeast and plant native protein
extracts demonstrated, using chromatography techniques,
that the catalytic subunits, together with their regulatory
counterparts, were present in high-molecular-weight frac-
tions, and that this assembly corresponded to the activity of
the SNF1 complex (Estruch et al., 1992; Sugden et al., 1999).
We previously demonstrated that MtSNF4b is incorporated
into a high-molecular-weight complex during the ﬁnal
stages of maturation (Rosnoblet et al., 2007). To investigate
the link between MtSNF4b complex formation and dor-
mancy, soluble proteins were extracted from hydrated
dormant seeds after imbibition for 48 h at 20°C, or from
hydrated seeds in which dormancy was released by imbibi-
tion at 4°C. No seeds had germinated after 48 h under either
imbibition condition, but cold-treated seeds germinated
within 12 h compared to 12–14 days for seeds that were
imbibed directly at 20°C. Freshly extracted native proteins
were separated by gel ﬁltration, after which the presence of
the SNF4b protein in the various fractions was analyzed by
Western blot (Figure 1c). SNF4b was not only visible in those
fractions corresponding to its own molecular weight
(approximately 42 kDa), but a high-molecular-weight com-
plex of 400–600 kDa containing SNF4b (fractions 1–4) was
also detected in dormant seeds. In contrast, imbibition of
seeds in which dormancy was released resulted in partial
dissociation of the complex, as evidenced by the almost
complete absence of SNF4b in these same fractions. Further
imbibition of non-dormant seeds was previously found to
lead to complete disappearance of SNF4b in fractions
>200 kDa (Rosnoblet et al., 2007). This suggests that the
SNF4b-associated complex remains intact during hydration
of dormant seeds.

MtSNF4b is a functional SNF4 subunit and interacts with
the a subunit of Medicago truncatula

To verify that the complex in which MtSNF4b participates is
a SnRK1 complex, we ﬁrst tested whether MtSNF4b indeed
encodes a functional homolog of the corresponding yeast
gene by complementation of a mutant deﬁcient in SNF4
(snf4D2). In yeast, the SNF4 protein is required for activation
of SNF1 kinase, which is essential for de-repression of sugar-
metabolizing enzymes in the absence of glucose. As a
consequence, snf4D2 mutants are able to grow on glucose
but not on galactose or other carbohydrate sources
(Figure 2a,b). Expression of MtSNF4b in a yeast strain with
a deletion in the SNF4 gene restored growth on galactose
to a level essentially equivalent to that in the wild-type
(Figure 2a).

In addition, a possible interaction with the catalytic a
subunit (SnRK1) was tested using a bacterial double hybrid
system. Screening of the EST databank Medicago truncatula
Gene Index (MTGI) as well as the Medicago truncatula
genome revealed the presence of one SnRK1 gene with 96
and 92.8% similarity to AKIN10 (Q38997) and AKIN11
(P92958) of Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively, and 96.6%
similarity with the SnRK1 of tomato (Q9M726, LeSNF1). The
sequence of this SnRK1, hereafter named MtSnRK1, was
cloned into the pTRG vector, and the MtSNF4b sequence
into the pBT vector. No auto-activation of either subunit
could be detected, but MtSNF4b and MtSnRK1 were capable
interacting with each other (Figure 2c). These data

with the SnRK1 subunit and is likely to play a role in
activation of
the SnRK1 catalytic function. These data
conﬁrm the results obtained for another member of the
PV42/SNF4b family, LeSNF4, which is capable of comple-
menting yeast snf1 and snf4 mutants and physically inter-
acting with LeSNF1 and LeSIP1 in a glucose-dependent
manner in yeast two-hybrid assays (Bradford et al., 2003).

Transcriptome proﬁling indicates a role for MtSNF4b
in gene regulation as a function of after-ripening time

To detect genes that are potentially regulated by MtSNF4b,
we made use of previously produced lines in which
MtSNF4b was silenced by RNAi (Rosnoblet et al., 2007),
together with a set of controls to verify the effects of trans-
formation and RNAi-mediated effects. Silencing MtSNF4b
reduced protein levels of SNF4b to almost undetectable
levels compared to wild-type seeds (Figure S1) (Rosnoblet
et al., 2007). A transcriptome analysis was performed on 6 h-
imbibed embryos of wild-type and RNAi Mtsnf4b lines at
2–3 weeks of AR, referred to as the fresh (F) dataset. As the
SNF4b remained complex only in freshly harvested imbibed
seeds, we also compared wild-type versus RNAi Mtsnf4b
seeds at 6 months of AR, in which the complex dissociated
upon imbibition (referred to as the stored, S, dataset). A third
analysis was added to identify the genes that are differen-
tially expressed in dormant (freshly harvested) versus non-
dormant seeds (after AR), as this dataset is not yet available
for M. truncatula seeds. For this purpose, a comparison was
made between wild-type seeds after 2–3 weeks of AR versus
6 months of AR, using RNA from the F and S datasets
(referred to as the dormancy, D, dataset). Sets of genes that
showed enhanced or decreased expression in each of the
three datasets were identiﬁed, and their overlap is presented
in a Venn diagram (Figure 2 and Appendix S1).

A total of 217 genes are present in the F dataset, compared
to only 37 genes in the S dataset, conﬁrming a dormancy-
related link as found for MtSNF4b expression and complex
formation (Figure 3). Comparison between the F and S
datasets showed that, irrespective of the duration of AR,
only seven genes were differentially up-regulated in both
datasets, such as 12-oxophytodionoate (OPDA) reductase,

a Myb transcription factor and two genes encoding plant
lipid transfer proteins (MtN5). Interestingly, when a thresh-
old P value of 0.05 was used instead of 0.01, an additional
two genes, encoding 12-OPDA reductase aand glutathione-
S-transferase, were detected.

Twenty-one genes overlapped between the D dataset and
the F dataset. Twenty were up-regulated in wild-type seeds
at 2–3 weeks of AR, encoding several pathogenesis-related
proteins (ABR17/18)
that are developmentally regulated
during seed development (Iturriaga et al., 1994), as well as
genes encoding chalcone synthase and chalcone reductase,
peroxidases or caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase (Appen-
dix S1). Only one gene overlapped between the down-
regulated F and D datasets, encoding a small heat-shock
protein. An additional 175 genes were found in the D dataset
that were not detected in the F dataset, including legumins
and caleosins amongst the up-regulated genes and 126
down-regulated genes, such as ribosomal RNAs or several
phosphatase 2C proteins that function as negative regula-
tors in ABA signaling (Figure 3 and Appendix S1) (Gosti
et al., 1999). Silencing MtSNF4b changes the expression of a
subset of genes that are regulated prior to AR.

MtSNF4b silencing reduces gene expression related
to secondary metabolism and biotic stress

From the comparison between the datasets, it is evident that
the largest set of genes that are regulated differentially
between mutant and wild-type are up-regulated genes of the
F dataset (Figure 3). Silencing MtSNF4b results in a decrease
in the expression of these genes when seeds are not yet fully
after-ripened. The main classes characterizing the 162
up-regulated genes in the F dataset are related to secondary
metabolism, biotic stress, the cell wall, transcription factors
and transport (Table 1). A large number of genes are impli-
cated in secondary metabolism, encoding enzymes related
to ﬂavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. A closer
look among them revealed that 27 genes encode various
isoforms of 11 of the 13 enzymes involved in medicarpin
biosynthesis (Appendix S2 and Figure S3). The class of
transcription factors contains ﬁve WRKY transcription fac-
tors and two ethylene-responsive transcription factors. In
addition, four genes related to protein fate encode RING-H2
ﬁnger proteins that belong to the ATL sub-family, which has
been suggested to be involved in the early steps of the plant
defense signaling pathway (Serrano and Guzman, 2004).
These results were conﬁrmed for several genes by quanti-
tative RT-PCR (Figures 4 and S2). In wild-type seeds, tran-
script levels of two genes found in the F dataset, chalcone
reductase (CHR) and a pathogenesis-related protein (PR10),
increased sharply during imbibition after only 2 weeks of
AR, whereas transcript levels remained low when seeds
were imbibed after complete AR (Figure 4a,d). In addition,
for both CHR (Figure 4a–c) and PR10 (Figure 4d–f), the
quantitative RT-PCR analysis conﬁrmed reduced expression

in seeds of three independent RNAi lines compared to wild-
type seeds and seeds transformed with a vector containing
RNAi construction targeted against the proximal region of
the MtENOD40-1 promoter, which serves as control for
RNAi-induced silencing. Comparable observations were
made on a number of other genes involved in secondary

metabolism (IFR, IFS and PAL) at two harvests before and
after AR (Figure S2). Using a PR10 family-speciﬁc antibody
(Ramos and Bisseling, 2003), it was veriﬁed that differences
in PR10 gene expression resulted in differences at the pro-
tein level (Figure 3g). For three independent biological rep-
licates, Western blots conﬁrmed that the PR10 protein level
was higher in control seeds than in mutant seeds.

Classiﬁcation of the 55 down-regulated genes in the F
dataset revealed that 26 genes are related to abiotic stress,
encoding eight heat-shock proteins, ﬁve late embryogenesis
abundant (LEA) proteins and four detoxiﬁcation enzymes
(Table 1 and Appendix S2). It is possible that the absence of
SNF4b provokes a stress response, which is also evident
from the up-regulation of a heat shock transcription factor in
the mutant seeds. Overall, these data suggest a role for
MtSNF4b in activation of constitutive defense responses to
biotic stress when seeds are in a dormant state.

Silencing MtSNF4b affects the speed of AR of freshly
harvested seeds

Given the potential link of MtSNF4b with dormancy, we
tested the effect of MtSNF4b silencing on germination speed
in relation to AR. Seeds of various lines grown under similar
conditions were imbibed in the dark at 20°C for various times
(Figure 5a–d). For wild-type seeds, freshly harvested seeds
germinated only partially (>20%) over 3 weeks of imbibition,
whereas seed lots that were after-ripened for 2–3 weeks
germinated within 8–16 days. Compared to wild-type seeds,
RNAi Mtsnf4b seeds germinated approximately twice as fast
after 2–3 weeks of AR, but were equally dormant when
imbibed straight after harvest. This difference in germina-
tion speed after 2–3 weeks of AR was observed for several

independent harvests in a reproducible manner (data not
shown). AR durations of 3 months and 1 year led to a
comparable germination speed between mutant and control
lines (Figure 5c,d).

Progress towards completion of germination is a function
of the mean base water potential [wb(g)] during imbibition
(Finch-Savage and Leubner-Metzger, 2006; Bradford and
Nonogaki, 2007). To assess how sub-optimal water condi-
tions inﬂuence germination time during the course of AR,
wild-type and mutant seeds after various durations of AR
were imbibed at )0.27 MPa using a polyethylene glycol
solution (Figure 5e–g). Imbibition of seeds after 2–3 weeks
of AR under these conditions exacerbated the differences in
germination behavior between wild-type and mutant seed
batches (Figure 5e). This difference was still observed but to
a lesser extent after 3 months of AR, and had completely
disappeared after 1 year of AR (Figure 5f,g). These data
suggest
that silencing MtSNF4b might be related to
a change in wb(g). While weakening of enclosing tissues is
a prerequisite for germination, embryo growth potential is a
second factor that determines whether a seed germinates or
not (Finch-Savage and Leubner-Metzger, 2006; Bradford and
Nonogaki, 2007). No difference in the penetration of tetra-
zolium was detected between mutant and wild-type seeds

(data not shown), discarding the hypothesis that cell-wall
permeability is at the origin of the reduced dormancy
phenotype, as found for Arabidopsis testa mutants
(Debeaujon et al., 2000). Collectively, these data indicate
that
the phenotype observed as a result of silencing
MtSNF4b is under the inﬂuence of a time-dependent com-
ponent controlled by dry storage and thus AR.

Action of SNF4b occurs downstream of ABA

Given the difference in dormancy and speed of AR induced
by silencing MtSNF4b, we investigated the possible link
between SNF4b and ABA signaling pathways. ABA con-
centrations above 10 lM induced rapid accumulation of the
SNF4b protein in immature seeds (Figure 6a). ABA contents
(Figure 6c,d) were assessed in seeds obtained from harvests
at 1 week and 8 months of AR, respectively, with the corre-
sponding germination behavior shown in Figure 6(b). No
signiﬁcant difference in ABA content after 1 week of AR was
detected between wild-type or RNAi seeds, regardless of
whether they were dry or imbibed for 24 h (Figure 6c),
although a twofold difference in germination speed was
observed. In addition, in the batch of seeds obtained after
8 months of AR, which almost completely relieved
dormancy, no difference between wild-type and mutant ABA
content was observed either.
Imbibition of these seeds
resulted in a slight but signiﬁcant decrease in ABA for the
wild-type and one of the RNAi lines (Figure 6d), but no large
degradation of ABA was detected as found for non-dormant
seeds of N. plumbaginifolia (Grappin et al., 2000). ABA
sensitivity was studied by evaluating the ﬁnal percentage
germination of seed lots after 8 months of AR as a function
of ABA concentration. A comparable sensitivity to ABA is
observed for two independent seed lots of RNAi Mtsnf4b
lines (Figure 4e). Fluridone was found to efﬁciently break
dormancy of both wild-type and mutant M. truncatula
seeds, decreasing the time for 50% germination (T50) from
152 to 20 h for wild-type seeds, and from 80–102 to 20–23 h
for two RNAi Mtsnf4b lines (Table S1). Incubation in pac-
lobutrazol (100 lM), a gibberellic acid (GA) inhibitor, dou-
bled the germination speed in both wild-type and mutant
lines. In contrast, GA3 up to concentrations of 100 lM had
little effect on germination speed and did not change the
germination behavior between mutant or wild-type seeds
(Figure S4). Thus, ABA is capable of inducing gene and
protein expression of MtSNF4b, but signaling pathways
downstream of MtSNF4b are not implicated in changing the
content or sensitivity of ABA during imbibition of M. trun-
catula seeds.

Role of MtSNF4b in sugar signaling

We next investigated a possible role of MtSNF4b in sugar
sensing pathways. Mannose and 2-deoxyglucose, glucose
analogs that are phosphorylated by hexokinase but not fur-
ther metabolized, cause repression of photosynthetic gene

expression at low physiological levels, and inhibit germina-
tion in Arabidopsis (Pego et al., 1999). Glucose produced via
a glycolysis-dependent pathway is capable of inducing the
expression of PR1 and PR5, which belong to the family of
pathogenesis-related proteins (Xiao et al., 2000; Jossier
et al., 2009). 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG), another glucose
analog, is taken up by the plant with the same efﬁciency as
glucose, but, unlike glucose, mannose or 2-deoxyglucose,
cannot be phosphorylated by hexokinase. This analog can
be used to activate a hexokinase-independent signaling
pathway via sugar uptake that activates expression of genes
such as PAL (Rolland et al., 2006). As several PAL genes were

differentially expressed between mutant and wild-type
embryos (Appendix S1), we ﬁrst determined the effect of
3-OMG on germination and gene expression in wild-type
seeds. Surprisingly, 3-OMG was capable of further delaying
the germination of dormant, 2-week AR seeds, but had no
further effect on germination of non-dormant seeds (Fig-
ure S5). Seeds with an intermediate dormancy level showed
an intermediate delay of germination by 3-OMG. Similarly,
3-OMG repressed the expression of PAL, CHR and IFR in
dormant seeds, but increased their expression in non-
dormant seeds (Figures 7a and S6a,g). The delay of germi-
nation in 2-week AR seeds of RNAi Mtsnf4b lines by 3-OMG
was comparable to that of wild-type seeds (Figure S7).
3-OMG has no signiﬁcant effect on gene expression (Fig-
ures 7b and S6b,h), comparable to that of 3-OMG on gene
expression in wild-type seeds at intermediate dormancy level.
In dormant and non-dormant wild-type seeds, mannose
did not affect germination or gene expression (Figures 7e, S5
and S6e,k). However, when MtSNF4b was silenced, mannose
delayed germination and increased gene expression in
2-week AR seeds. Likewise, glucose increased gene expres-
sion in RNAi Mtsnf4b seeds but had no effect in wild-type
seeds (Figures 7c and S6c,i). The effect of glucose on
germination was dependent on the dormancy level, resulting
in an increase in the speed and homogeneity of germination
in both dormant wild-type and RNAi seeds at 2 weeks of AR
(Figures S5 and S7). Glucose had no effect on germination in
non-dormant wild-type seeds, as is the case for Arabidopsis
(Pego et al., 1999). The fact that these observations did not
result from an osmotic effect brought about by the sugars
was veriﬁed by using a polyethylene glycol solution with a
comparable osmotic water potential (Figure S8).

DISCUSSION

This analysis shows that MtSNF4b, a functional subunit of
the SnRK1 complex in M. truncatula, is involved in seed
dormancy-related events. Silencing MtSNF4b affects the
expression of biotic stress-related genes that are expressed
in seeds during imbibition only when they are dormant. In
addition, silencing of MtSNF4b also resulted in faster AR of
freshly harvested seeds. We previously demonstrated a role
for MtSNF4b during maturation (Rosnoblet et al., 2007), and
the present study indicates an additional role for MtSNF4b
during the germination phase of seeds. At the ﬁnal stages of
maturation, concomitant with the formation of a SnRK1/
SNF4b complex, oligosaccharide accumulation was affected
in RNAi Mtsnf4b seeds,
in addition to the longevity of
mature seeds (Rosnoblet et al., 2007). The effect of MtSNF4b
on AR may have an indirect origin via modiﬁcation of cell
walls through activation of biotic defenses. In MtSNF4b-
deﬁcient embryos,
transcriptomic analysis revealed an
up-regulation of genes involved in cell-wall metabolism and
rigidity, such as enzymes involved in the breakdown of
galactomannans (a-galactosidase and b-mannosidase), as

well as down-regulation of a polygalacturonase inhibitor
(Table 1 and Appendix S1). However, several studies have
suggested a role for SNF4b in dormancy or AR (Bradford
et al., 2003; Argyris et al., 2008; Carrera et al., 2008). A
homolog of MtSNF4b in tomato, LeSNF4, was previously
identiﬁed as being highly expressed in non-germinating
tissues, and was suggested to indicate a high effective ABA/
GA ratio in seeds (Argyris et al., 2008). Indeed, genes asso-
ciated with the synthesis and deactivation of GA and ABA
are reciprocally regulated in association with the imposition
and release of dormancy (Cadman et al., 2006). Although
we conﬁrmed that the regulatory subunit SNF4b is ABA-
inducible, our study failed to demonstrate a direct down-
stream link with ABA, either by pharmacological approaches
or transcriptomic analyses (Figure 6 and Appendix S1).
Recently, a study was performed with the aim of separating
the action of ABA in seed dormancy from AR-regulated gene
expression using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants defective in
ABA synthesis or perception (Carrera et al., 2008). Interest-

ingly, the homolog of MtSNF4b in Arabidopsis, At1g15330,
was identiﬁed as one of the 103 genes that were down-reg-
ulated by AR independently of ABA signaling (Carrera et al.,
2008). These data support the suggestion that SNF4b plays a
role in AR rather than dormancy, and conﬁrm the ABA-
independent pathway downstream of MtSNF4b.

Given the suggested link between SnRK1 and sugar
signaling pathways (Tiessen et al., 2003; Jossier et al.,
2009), it is possible that the altered soluble sugar composition
in RNAi seeds observed by Rosnoblet et al. (2007) is related to
the phenotypes observed in this study. We ﬁrst veriﬁed
whether this difference in sugar content had an effect on
osmotic potential, which might explain the germination
phenotype. However, when expressed on a molar basis, no
difference exists in sugar content between mutant and wild-
type seeds, indicating that the ﬁnal difference in osmotic
pressure due to differences in sugar composition is negligi-
ble. Our pharmacological studies and quantitative RT-PCR
experiments indicated a complex relationship between sugar

perception, signaling and dormancy. Whereas glucose and
mannose delay seed germination of Arabidopsis (Pego et al.,
1999), this is not the case for M. truncatula, raising the
question of whether differences in mechanisms of sugar
sensing exist between species. After-ripening modiﬁed the
perception of 3-OMG in M. truncatula seeds. In non-dormant
seeds, 3-OMG induced expression of PAL, CHR and IFR,
whereas expression of these genes was repressed by 3-OMG
in dormant seeds. It remains to be investigated whether this
effect implies sugar sensing via a hexokinase-independent
pathway or perturbed metabolism due to a putative accu-
mulation of 3-O-methylglucose-6-phosphate (Corte` s et al.,
2003), which may have a different effect on dormant versus
non-dormant seeds. The effect of 3-OMG on gene expression
appears to be independent of MtSNF4b. The difference
between wild-type and RNAi seeds is most likely due to a
lower dormancy level in the 2-week AR RNAi seeds, which is
comparable to that of wild-type seeds after 4 weeks of AR.

Our

results rule out

the possibility that a hexose
signaling pathway acts upstream of MtSNF4b, because
this implies that these sugars would activate sugar signal-
ing pathways in wild-type seeds but not in RNAi Mtsnf4b
seeds. However, glucose and mannose appear to act
downstream of MtSNF4b in activating gene expression.
Both sugars are capable of restoring PAL, CHR and IFR
expression in Mtsnf4b mutants to levels comparable to
those of wild-type seeds after 2 weeks of AR. Also,
mannose delays germination of RNAi seeds but not of
wild-type seeds. These results suggest that activation of a
hexokinase-mediated signaling pathway is capable of
restoring the phenotype of
the mutants and coupling
germination behavior with defense gene expression. How-
ever, glucose does not delay germination,
leaving the
possibility open that AR/germination and gene expression
are controlled by two independent signaling pathways that
are both inﬂuenced by MtSNF4b. An alternative explana-
tion is that mannose de-regulates carbon and energy
metabolism more profoundly when MtSNF4b is silenced.
The effect of MtSNF4b on biotic stress-related gene
expression during hydration of dormant seeds appears to
be uncoupled from the maturation phenotype. We showed
that expression of these genes is activated during imbibition
of freshly harvested dry wild-type seeds, and not the result
of accumulation of transcripts during maturation. In SNF4b-
deﬁcient seeds, this activation is largely impeded. The genes
that are differentially expressed as a result of silencing
MtSNF4b are classiﬁed in the groups ‘disease, virulence and
defense’, ‘cell wall’ and ‘secondary metabolism’. MtSNF4b
silencing-induced reduction in PR10 transcripts was also
found at the translational level. However, the role for PR10
proteins in biotic stress is circumstantial. PR10 genes are
known to be induced by pathogens as well as abiotic
stresses (McGee et al., 2001; Hashimoto et al., 2004). Silenc-
ing of PR10 resulted in an increased resistance to Aphano-

myces euteiches, probably due to increased expression of
PR-5b proteins (Colditz et al., 2007). On the other hand, over-
expression of pea ABR17 in Arabidopsis rendered the seeds
and seedlings more tolerant to abiotic stresses (Srivastava
et al., 2006). The functionality of the largest group of genes,
which are related to phenylpropanoid metabolism (PAL, C4H
and CCoAOMT) and ﬂavonoid and isoﬂavonoid biosynthesis
genes (CHS, CHR, CHI, IFS, HID, IFR and VR), remains to be
tested in M. truncatula seeds. Most of these genes were
found to be induced by pathogens or elicitors in M. trunca-
tula and correlate with the accumulation of medicarpin
(Deavours and Dixon, 2005; Dhaubhadel et al., 2007;
Naoumkina et al., 2007). Medicarpin is an anti-fungal ptero-
carpan phytoalexin that is produced by many legumes
(Mundodi et al., 2001). Furthermore, medicarpin has been
found to delay alfalfa seed germination (Miller et al., 1988;
Dornbos et al., 1990). It may be that this phytoalexin is
present in seeds primarily to avoid predation or microbial
infections, but also has an effect on the regulation of
germination in legume seeds.

What might be the downstream targets of the SnRK1/
SNF4b complex that are responsible for the differential gene
expression in relation to biotic stress? Direct targets are most
likely (de)activated through phosphorylation by the catalytic
a subunit and will not be identiﬁed by the transcriptome
analysis. Nonetheless, expression of several WRKY genes in
the F dataset points suggests possible downstream regula-
tion by MtSNF4b. A recent study on a kinase–protein inter-
action in rice identiﬁed SnRK1 as a potential phosphorylation
candidate of WRKY (Ding et al., 2009). WRKY proteins are
involved in the regulation of plant defense responses
(Eulgem and Somssich, 2007). A massive induction of WRKY
transcription factor genes is correlated with the induction of
genes involved in the central phenylpropanoid pathway and
the downstream steps in the biosynthesis of medicarpin
(Naoumkina et al., 2007). Over-expression of the same WRKY
genes as those found in our
transcriptomic analysis
(W100630 and W108715) in transgenic tobacco enhances
typical defense responses such as PR protein production and
accumulation of soluble and wall-bound phenolic com-
pounds (Naoumkina et al., 2008). In addition, they were
shown to be induced by either yeast elicitor or methyl
jasmonate (Naoumkina et al., 2008). Our transcriptomic
analysis also revealed a link to jasmonic acid (JA). Three
12-OPDA reductase genes are down-regulated by silencing
MtSNF4b, irrespective of the AR status of the seeds. These
genes are responsible for the reduction of 12-OPDA to form
OPC-8:0, which is subjected to b-oxidation to yield JA. JA and
OPDA are both active as signaling molecules and induce the
expression of overlapping but distinct sets of genes involved
in biotic stresses (Taki et al., 2005).

Although a number of genes regulated by MtSNF4b are
also found in the D dataset, additional genes related to
defense are also differentially regulated when MtSNF4b is

silenced, suggesting that this subset of genes is directly
related to the action of SNF4b and not simply to the reduced
dormancy status of the mutant embryos. Imbibed dormant
M. truncatula seeds have seed coats that remain devoid of
any contaminating fungi and bacteria for months, whereas
isolated seed coats are readily infected (data not shown).
Expression studies in dormant Arabidopsis seeds demon-
strated that genes related to defense and protection are also
highly expressed (Cadman et al., 2006). It remains to be
tested whether the activation of defense gene expression by
the SNF4b/SnRK1/b complex in seeds renders them more
resistant to pathogen attack. An interesting parallel can be
made with the developmentally induced dormancy in the
drought-tolerant plant Retama raetam, a desert legume
(Pnueli et al., 2002). Dormancy in this plant is accompanied
by the accumulation of
transcripts encoding PR10-like
proteins and WRKY transcription factors, whereas non-
dormant plants subjected to stress conditions contained
transcripts encoding small heat shock proteins.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Detailed experimental procedures used in this study are supplied in
Appendix S3.

Plant material and treatments

Seeds of Medicago truncatula Gaertn. (R108) were harvested at the
same time for all genotypes from plants that were grown side by
side under identical environmental conditions as described by
Rosnoblet et al. (2007). After-ripening occurred during storage at
60% RH, 20°C in the dark. After various durations of AR, batches of
50–100 seeds were scariﬁed using sand paper and imbibed in water
or in a polyethylene glycol solution ()0.27 MPa) at 20°C in the dark,
and were considered to have germinated when the radicle pro-
truded from the surrounding envelope. Statistical analysis of the
germination data was performed using the v2 test, and differences
were considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05. To release dormancy, seeds
were either imbibed for 48 h at 4°C and subsequently transferred to
20°C, or imbibed in 100 lM ﬂuridone [1-methyl-3-phenyl-5-(3-triﬂu-
oromethyl-(phenyl))-4-(1H)-pyridinone]
http://www.
duchefa.com). ABA sensitivity was tested on seeds after 8 months
of AR that were imbibed at various concentrations of ABA (Sigma,
http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/) (control in 0.1% EtOH) in the dark at
20°C, and the ﬁnal percentage germination was determined. For the
microarray analysis, seeds at 2–3 weeks and 6 months of AR were
imbibed in the dark for 6 h. For pharmacological studies, seeds were
imbibed at 20°C in the dark in water or 50 mM 3-O-methylglucose
(Sigma), 60 mM glucose (Sigma), 20 mM mannose (Sigma) or
40 mM glucosamine (Sigma) at various durations of AR. For quan-
titative RT-PCR studies, 20 h-imbibed embryos were removed from
the seed coat and endosperm and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Plasmid construction and plant transformation

SNF4b RNAi plasmid construction using the binary vector
pFGC5941/Gateway (pFRB), transformation of the plasmid into
M. truncatula and selection of positive lines were performed as
described by Rosnoblet et al. (2007). Four homozygous lines (T2)
were retained for further analysis. Two additional transformants
were used as negative controls: an R108 line transformed with the
empty vector (RNAi empty) and an R108 line transformed with

the pFGC5941 vector containing an RNAi construct targeted against
the proximal region (1.2 kb) of the MtENOD40-1 promoter (RNAi
control). All studies were performed on seeds of the T2 or T3
generation.

Gel ﬁltration chromatography and Western blot

Seeds at 1–2 weeks of AR were imbibed for 48 h at 4 or 20°C in the
dark, after which native proteins were extracted and separated
according to their molecular weight as described by Rosnoblet et al.
(2007). Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-
SNF4b antibody as described by Rosnoblet et al. (2007). To study
the effect of ABA, immature embryos at 16 days after pollination
were incubated for 6 h in various concentrations of ABA.
Soluble proteins were extracted and analyzed by Western blotting
(10 lg/lane) using the anti-SNF4b antibody. For PR10 protein
induction, soluble proteins were extracted from 36 h imbibed
embryos after 2 weeks of AR and analyzed by Western blotting
using an antibody against pea PsRH2 that recognizes MtPR10-1
(Ramos and Bisseling, 2003).

Complementation assay

The cDNA of MtSNF4b was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO and
recombined with pYES-DEST52 (Invitrogen, http://www.invitro-
gen.com/). The plasmid pYES-DEST52-MtSNF4b and the empty
plasmid were introduced into the Dsnf4 mutant of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae MCY2634 (MATa his3-D200 leu2-3112 ura3-52 snf4D2).
Strains were plated on yeast nitrogen base (YNB)/2% glucose or
YNB/2% galactose.

Bacterial two-hybrid analysis

MtSNF4b was cloned into the pBT vector fused with a lamba-cl DNA
binding site and MtSNF1 (TC116507) was cloned into the pTRG
vector fused with RNA polymerase-a. Reporter competent cells
were co-transformed with both vectors using bacterioMatch II
(Stratagene, http://www.stratagene.com/) according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol, and spotted on selective (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole
and streptomycin) and non-selective media by 20 ll of saturated
culture (1/1, 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000) and incubated at 37°C for 1 and
2 days, respectively. Negative controls were bacteria co-trans-
formed with pTRGGal11 and pBTMtSNF4b or pTRGMtSNF1 and
pBT vectors.

ABA measurements

ABA content was measured in dry and imbibed seeds at 1 week and
8 months of AR, using two harvests. Imbibition times were 24 h
(1 week AR) or 18 h (8 months AR). Extraction was performed on
three biological replicates of 25 seeds as described by Jiang and
Zhang (2001). ABA concentration was determined using the Phy-
todetek ABA immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Idetek).

Isolation of total RNA and mRNA puriﬁcation

Total RNA was isolated as described by Verwoerd et al. (1989).
Puriﬁcation of mRNA was performed using a PolyATract mRNA
isolation system III kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Promega, http://www.promega.com/). The quality of mRNA was
assessed using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent, http://www.
agilent.com).

Microarray analysis

Three microarray experiments were conducted to compare the
transcriptome in embryos of (i) wild-type versus two RNAi lines at

ª 2010 The Authors

802 William Bolingue et al.

2–3 weeks of AR, (ii) wild-type versus one RNAi line at 6 months of
AR, and (iii) wild-type embryos at 2 weeks versus 6 months of AR
(dormant versus nondormant). Microarray analysis replicates
consisted of three independent biological replicates of 50 embryos,
obtained from different plants. Probe labeling using the
CyScribe cDNA post-labeling kit
(GE Healthcare, http://www.
gelifesciences.com), hybridization and image acquisition were
performed as described by Buitink et al. (2006). Dye-speciﬁc varia-
tions were accounted for using a dye swap between the various
wild-type RNA samples. Hybridization was performed using
Mt16kOLI1Plus chips (Hohnjec et al., 2005). Image data processing
was performed using GENESPRING software (Agilent). Genes with
a signiﬁcant difference (P value <0.01) and >1.5 fold change in
expression were considered.

Real-time quantitative PCR analysis

Reverse transcription reactions were performed on 1 lg of total
RNA using a QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen, http://
www.qiagen.com/). Quantiﬁcation of cDNA by quantitative RT-PCR
was performed using an ABI PRISM 7100 sequence detection sys-
tem (Applied Biosystems, http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/) and
SYBR Green. Values are based on three repetitions. The constitu-
tively expressed mRNA Msc27 was used as a housekeeping gene for
standardizing data and to assess the efﬁciency of quantitative
RT-PCR (Gallardo et al., 2007). Ampliﬁcation primers are listed in
Table S2. Changes in transcript abundance were estimated as the
fold change relative to control conditions (Livak and Schmittgen,
2001).
