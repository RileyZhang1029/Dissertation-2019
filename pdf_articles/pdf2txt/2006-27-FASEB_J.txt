ABSTRACT
that led to tau hyperphosphorylation, nitration, and
accumulation as seen in Alzheimer’s disease brain, and
the underlying mechanisms, we bilaterally injected
SIN-1, a recognized peroxynitrite donor, into the hip-
pocampus of rat brain. We observed that the level of
nitrated and hyperphosphorylated tau was markedly
increased in rat hippocampus 24 h after drug adminis-
tration, and these alterations were prevented by prein-
jection of uric acid, a natural scavenger of peroxyni-
trite. Concomitantly, we detected a
signiﬁcant
activation in glycogen synthase kinase-3␤ (GSK-3␤) and
p38 MAPKs, including p38␣, p38␤, and p38␦, but no
obvious change was measured in the activity of p38␥,
ERK, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK). Both
nitrated tau and hyperphosphorylated tau were aggre-
gated in the hippocampus, in which the activity of 20S
proteasome was signiﬁcantly arrested in SIN-1-injected
rats. Further studies demonstrated that the hyperphos-
phorylated tau was degraded as efﬁciently as normal
tau by 20S proteasome, but the nitrated tau with an
unorderly secondary structure became more resistant
to the proteolysis. These results provide the ﬁrst in vivo
evidence showing that peroxynitrite simultaneously in-
duces tau hyperphosphorylation, nitration, and accu-
mulation, and that activation of GSK-3␤, p38␣, p38␤,
p38␦ isoforms and the inhibition of proteasome activity
are respectively responsible for the peroxynitrite-in-
duced tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation.
Our ﬁndings reveal a common upstream stimulator and
a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer-like neuro-
degeneration.—Zhang, Y-J., Xu, Y-F., Liu, Y-H., Yin, J.,

Neurofibrillary tangle is a deﬁning pathological
alteration seen in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Studies have demonstrated that neuroﬁbrillary

tangle is made up of paired helical ﬁlament (PHF)/
straight ﬁlament (SF), and the major protein compo-
nent of PHF/SF is the hyperphosphorylated microtu-
bule-associated protein tau (1–3). The normal function
of tau is to promote microtubule assembly and to
stabilize microtubules. When tau is abnormally hyper-
phosphorylated, as seen in AD brain, it becomes incom-
petent in binding to and stabilizing microtubules, lead-
ing to aberrant aggregation in the neurons.
In
addition, it has been demonstrated recently that PHF-
tau is also nitrated and the nitrated tau is colocalized
with neuroﬁbrillary tangle in AD brain (4). Moreover,
the nitrated tau also shows a signiﬁcantly decreased
binding activity to microtubules and aggregates in the
brains of patients with tauopathies and in peroxynitrite-
treated cells (4, 5). These studies together suggest that
tau nitration is involved in the formation of ﬁlamentous
tau inclusions. Hence, not only tau hyperphosphoryla-
tion, but also tau nitration appears to contribute to AD
pathology. However, the upstream factor(s) leading to
both hyperphosphorylation and nitration of tau is not
understood.

The majority of cases of sporadic AD are aging
dependent. With brain aging, accumulation of oxidants
may play an important role in initiating the abnormal
posttranslational modiﬁcations of tau. For instance,
peroxynitrite, the product of the diffusion-limited reac-
tion between NO and superoxide (k ⬃1010 M–1s–1) (6),
is a potent nitration mediator and strong oxidant
implicated in AD pathogenesis (7–12). Peroxynitrite
modiﬁes tyrosine residues in protein and thus gener-
ates a stable compound, namely 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT).
As nitration is a permanent footprint, detection of 3-NT
is an indicator for peroxynitrite involvement. In AD
brain, the concentration of 3-NT was elevated mark-
edly, especially in the hippocampus (7). And the signif-
icantly elevated 3-NT was positively correlated with

decreased cognitive functions in AD patients (8). More-
over, uric acid, a proposed endogenous peroxynitrite
scavenger, was decreased in a manner consistent with
the increases of 3-NT (7), whereas the protein nitra-
tion, including tau, increased signiﬁcantly in AD brain
(4, 9 –12). These ﬁndings strongly suggest that the
elevated peroxynitrite may be responsible for the nitra-
tion of tau seen in AD.

Does peroxynitrite also contribute to tau hyper-
phosphorylation? Studies have demonstrated that per-
oxynitrite, acting as a signaling molecule, regulates
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and phos-
phatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3K) -mediated signal trans-
duction pathways. MAPK is a family of serine/threo-
nine kinases activated by dual phosphorylation of
tyrosine and threonine residues. They are subdivided
into extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun
amino-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPKs.
It was reported that peroxynitrite activated all three
MAPKs in a wide variety of cell types (13–19). In contrast
to activating MAPKs, peroxynitrite inhibited the PI 3K
pathway (20). Peroxynitrite induced nitration of p85
regulatory subunit of PI 3K in vitro (21), and this
nitration abrogated its interaction with the catalytic
subunit p110, thus inhibiting PI 3K activity (22). PI 3K
is known to stimulate Akt/PKB, which in turn inhibited
the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3␤ (GSK-3␤) by
phosphorylating GSK-3␤ at Ser-9 (23). Therefore,
down-regulation of the PI 3K pathway could lead to
overactivation of GSK-3␤ (22). MAPKs and GSK-3␤ are
proline-directed protein kinases and play important
roles in hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD brain (24).
From these studies it is suggested that peroxynitrite
may induce tau hyperphosphorylation through overac-
tivating MAPKs and GSK-3␤.

In the present study we injected bilaterally 3-morpho-
lino-sydnonimine (SIN-1), a recognized and widely
used peroxynitrite donor (25–30), into rat hippocam-
pus, and investigated whether or not peroxynitrite
could induce simultaneously nitration and hyperphos-
phorylation of tau and the underlying mechanisms in
vivo. We found that peroxynitrite could induce nitra-
tion/hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau.
The activation of GSK-3␤ and the p38 MAPKs family
and the inhibition of proteasome proteinase activities
are respectively responsible for peroxynitrite-induced
tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation. These
ﬁndings provide new clues in understanding the role of
oxidative and nitrative lesions in AD pathology.

Hippocampus injection

Male Wistar rats (250⫾20 g) were obtained from the Exper-
iment Animal Center of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong
University of Science and Technology. The rats were trained
by Morris water maze (31). Then these rats (n⫽10 for each
group) were deeply anesthetized intraperitoneally with chlo-
ral hydrate (30 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotactic instru-
ment. After a skin incision and exposure of the occipital
bone, holes were drilled at coordinates of 4.0 mM anterior to
posterior (AP) bregma, 2.0 mM mid to lateral (ML), 4.0 mM
dorsal to ventral (DV). Rats were injected ﬁrst into the right
hippocampus of 3 ␮l SIN-1 at 10, 25, and 50 mM, respectively,
or 3 ␮l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as vehicle control. A
second injection was given at the same coordinates into the
left hippocampus. To conﬁrm the effects of peroxynitrite, we
infused uric acid (15 ␮l, 5 mM), a natural scavenger of
peroxynitrite (65– 68), into the left ventricle of the rats at the
coordinates of AP-0.8 mM, ML-1.5 mM and DV-3.8 mM 1 h
before the hippocampal injection of SIN-1 (25 mM). All
surgical procedures were completed under sterile conditions
and penicillin (200,000 U, intramuscularly) was injected to
prevent infection. The animals were tested again for spatial
memory retention in the water maze 24 h after the drug
injection. Though no signiﬁcant spatial memory deﬁcits were
detected in SIN-1-injected rats (data not shown), we found
that the training process was crucial for obtaining the repro-
ducible results in tau hyperphosphorylation and GSK-3 acti-
vation.

Western blot

Rats were sacriﬁced 24 h after the injection, and the hip-
pocampus was immediately homogenized at 4°C using a

TeﬂonTM glass homogenizer in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150
mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM
benzamidine, 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 10
␮g/ml leupeptin, 10 ␮g/ml aprotinin, and 10 ␮g/ml pepsta-
tin. The tissue homogenate was added to one-third volume of
sample buffer containing 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 8% SDS,
40% glycerol, 40 mM DTT and boiled for 10 min in a water
bath, then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 25°C. The
supernatant was stored at – 80°C for Western blot analysis.
The protein concentration in the supernatant was measured
by BCA kit according to manufacturer’s instruction. Equal
amounts of protein were separated by a 10% SDS-polyacryl-
amide gel, then transferred electrically onto nitrocellulose
membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% defatted
milk dissolved in TBS-Tween-20 (TBS-T) (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Tween-20) for 1 h at 37°C. The
blot was then incubated with mAb n847 (1:500), mAb DM1A
(1:1000), pAb R134d (1:5000), mAb PHF-1 (1:500), pAb
pThr-231 (1:500), pAb p38 (1:500), pAb phospho-p38 (1:
500), pAb ERK (1:500), pAb phospho-ERK (1:500), pAb
GSK-3␤ (1:1000), pAb phospho-GSK-3␤ (Ser-9 (1:1000), or
pAb phospho-JNK1&2 (1:500) overnight at 4°C. The mem-
brane was washed three times with TBS-T, then incubated
with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (1:5000) for 1 h at 37°C. The blot was washed
three times with TBS-T, then visualized using the enhanced
chemiluminescence method. The protein bands were quan-
titatively analyzed by Kodak Digital Science 1D software
(Eastman Kodak Company, New Haven, CT, USA). The level
of total tau was calculated based on ␣-tubulin, and the level of
nitrated tau and hyperphosphorylated tau was normalized by
total tau; all tau bands, which may result from differential
posttranslational modiﬁcations and degradation commonly
seen in tau proteins, have been quantitatively analyzed as a
one band per lane. The level of phospho-p38 MAPKs, phos-
pho-ERK, phospho-GSK-3␤, and nitrated p85 was normalized
by total p38, ERK, GSK-3␤, and p85, respectively. All were
expressed as relative level of the sum optical density against
corresponding control.

GSK-3 activity assay

The hippocampus was homogenized as described above and
the homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min at
4°C. The resulting supernatant was assayed for GSK-3 activity
using phospho-GS peptide 2 as described previously (47,63).
Brieﬂy, 7.5 ␮g protein was incubated for 30 min at 30°C with
20 ␮M peptide substrate and 200 ␮M ␥-32P ATP (1,500
cpm/pmol ATP) in 30 mM Tris, pH7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 10
mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM EGTA, and 10 mM ␤-mer-
captoethanol in a total volume of 25 ␮l. The reaction was
stopped with 25 ␮l of 300 mM o-phosphoric acid. Then 25 ␮l
of the reaction mixture was applied in duplicates to phospho-
cellulose units. The ﬁlters were washed 3 times with 75 mM
o-phosphoric acid, dried and analyzed by a liquid scintillation
counter (1450 MicroBeta JET, PerkinElmer Life and Analyt-
ical Sciences, Shelton, CT, USA). Relative activity of GSK-3
activity was expressed.

␮g/ml each aprotinin,
leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mM
Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF). After spinning the homogenate at
14,000 g for 15 min at 4°C, the supernatant (1 ml) was
incubated with 100 ␮l of protein G agarose on a shaker for 10
min at 4°C to remove the nonspeciﬁc binding protein. The
protein G beads were removed by spin at 14,000 g for 10 min
at 4°C. The supernatant (750 ␮g protein in 1 mg/ml) was
incubated with 4 ␮g of anti-p85 antibody (Ab) overnight at
4°C with gentle shaking. The Ag/antibody immunocomplex
was captured by further incubating with 100 ␮l of PBS-washed
protein G agarose beads for 2 h and spinning for 5 s at 14,000
g. The beads were washed three times with PBS and resus-
pended in 60 ␮l 2 ⫻ sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min in
water bath, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at
14,000 g for 1 min. Finally, the proteins were analyzed by
Western blot with pAb p85, and the same membrane was
stripped and reprobed with mAb 3-nitrotyrosine to detect the
nitrated p85.

Immunoﬂuorescence

Rats were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 200
ml normal saline (NS), then perfused with 400 ml 4%
paraformaldehyde solution 24 h after injection of 25 mM
SIN-1 or vehicle. The brain was removed from the skull and
postﬁxed in the same solution for 12 h at 4°C, then sliced into
30 ␮m coronary sections with a Vibratome (LANCER, S100,
image analysis, the 30 ␮m
TPI, Germany). For confocal
vibratome sections were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton
X-100-PBS for 30 min. The sections were blocked with 5%
BSA for 1 h at 37°C and incubated with either mAb n847
(1:500), or mAb PHF-1 (1:250), or pAb cleaved caspase-3
(1:100) for 48 h at 4°C, followed by 1 h at room temperature.
After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with Oregon
Green 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H⫹L) (1:1000)
(n847 and PHF-1) or rhodamine Red-X-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (H⫹L) (1:1000) (cleaved caspase-3) for 2 h at
37°C in the dark, then Hoechst 33258 (10 ␮g/ml) was added
to stain the nuclei. Sections were washed and mounted in PBS
with 10% glycerol, and ﬂuorescence was measured using
Olympus FV500 Laser Scanning Confocal microscope (Olym-
pus Optical, Tokyo, Japan).

Quantitative analysis of the cell nuclei and activated
caspase-3-positive cells

The cell viability in the hippocampus of the SIN-1- or PBS-
(control) injected rats was measured by counting the number
of cells labeled with Hoechst 33258. The cell apoptosis was
estimated by immunostaining of the cells with the activated
form of caspase-3 Ab. Six sections at a 90 ␮m interval in each
rat (3 rats for each group) were used for quantitative analysis
by using Image-Pro Plus 4.5 system (Media Cybernetics, Inc.,
Silver Spring, MD, USA). The number of the cells was
counted in six ﬁelds of each section at an original magniﬁca-
tion of ⫻200 by using Olympus FV500 Laser Scanning
Confocal Microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan).

Immunoprecipitation

Measurement of proteasome activity

As the most obvious changes in GSK-3␤ and tau modiﬁcations
were observed at 25 mM of SIN-1 administration, we used this
concentration for the mechanism studies. Rats were sacriﬁced
24 h after the injection with 25 mM SIN-1. The hippocampus
was quickly dissected out and homogenized in 9 volumes
(m/v) of ice-cold modiﬁed radio-immunoprecipitation assay
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet

Proteasome activity was determined by assaying the chymo-
trypsin-hydrolase peptide hydrolyzing activity (32,33). Brieﬂy,
250 ␮l hippocampus homogenate (2 ␮g/␮l), prepared with
10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.035% SDS, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5
mM ATP, were incubated with 5 mM (2.5 ␮l) synthetic
substrate (H-Ala-Ala-Phe-AMC) at 37°C for 1 h, then the
released concentration of 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)

was measured by ﬂuorimetry at 370 nM excitation and 430
nM emission using Molecular Devices SPECTRAmax M2
Fluorescent Microplate Reader (Process Analysis and Auto-
mation Ltd, Hampshire, UK). The activity of proteasome was
expressed by subtracting the background value, which was
determined by incubating the reaction mixture with 50 ␮M of
lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor, for 30 min before the
addition of proteasome substrate.

Puriﬁcation, nitration, and phosphorylation of tau in vitro

Human tau 39 (Htau39) was expressed in E. coli strain BL21.
The recombinant tau protein was isolated and puriﬁed by
phosphocellulose chromatography followed by Sephacryl
S-300 Gel ﬁltration (5). The nitration of tau by peroxynitrite
was carried out as described previously (5). Brieﬂy, Htau39 (1
mg/ml) dissolved in reaction buffer (100 mM potassium
phosphate, 25 mM sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1 mM diethyl-
enetriamine pentaacetic acid, pH 6.4) was reacted with de-
composed peroxynitrite or 1 mM authentic peroxynitrite at
37°C for 10 min with robust shaking. The concentration of
stock peroxynitrite was determined by measuring the absor-
bance at 302 nM (ε
⫽1670 M–1cm–1). After reaction, the
nitration of tau was determined by Western blot with mAb
3-nitrotyrosine. Phosphorylation of tau by GSK-3␤ was carried
according to the method described (34). Brieﬂy, Htau39 was
incubated in the absence or presence of GSK-3␤ (50 munits/
ml) in a reaction mixture containing 0.25 mg/ml of tau, 10
mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.
The reaction was initiated by the addition of the kinase. After
incubation at 30°C for 4 h, the reaction was stopped by
heating at 95°C for 10 min and the denatured kinase was
removed by centrifugation (10,000 g for 10 min). The phos-
phorylation of tau was determined by Western blot with
PHF-1 Ab.

302

In vitro degradation of tau with 20S proteasome

The degradation of tau by 20S proteasome in vitro was
measured by a method described previously (35). Brieﬂy,
recombinant normal tau, phosphorylated tau, and nitrated
tau were diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 200 nM and
incubated with or without 10 nM puriﬁed human erythrocyte
20S proteasome in 30 ␮l reaction mixture containing 50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.02% Tween-20 (v/v). The mixture was
incubated at 37°C for 1 h or 4 h and the reaction was
terminated by addition of one-third volume of sample buffer.
Tau degradation was revealed by Western blot with pAb
R134d as described above.

Circular dichroism spectroscopy

Circular dichroism (CD) spectra from normal tau or nitrated
tau (0.1 mg/ml) in water were taken using Jasco J-810 spectrapo-
larimeter (Jasco international Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The CD
spectra were recorded in the range of 190–250 nM using a 0.1
cm path length quartz cuvette at 25°C in continuous scanning
mode. The acquisition parameters were 100 nM/min, with a
1.0 s response and a 1.0 nM band width. The data were
accumulated over 10 runs, the presented data being the average.
The results were expressed in term of molecular ellipticity [␪] in
unit of deg.cm2/dmol.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using statistical Packages for the Social
Sciences 10.0 statistical software. The 1-way ANOVA proce-
dure followed by least signiﬁcant differences post hoc tests

was used to determine the statistical signiﬁcance of differ-
ences of the means.

RESULTS

Effects of SIN-1 in nitration and
hyperphosphorylation of tau and cell viability in
rat hippocampus

After injection of 10, 25, and 50 mM of 3.0 ␮l SIN-1 into
the hippocampi of the rat brains, we found an increase
of tau nitration to 2.2- (P⬍0.01), 2.7- (P⬍0.01), and
2.7-fold (P⬍0.01), respectively, of the control level as
measured by Western blots developed with Ab n847
(Fig. 1A, B). This increase of tau nitration conﬁrms the
production of peroxynitrite in the injected rat hip-
pocampus; then changes in the phosphorylation con-
centration of tau were examined by using phosphory-
lation-dependent and site-speciﬁc tau antibodies. We
found that the level of phosphorylated tau (at PHF-1
epitope) increased to 1.5- (P⬍0.01), 1.5- (P⬍0.01), and
1.3-fold (P⬍0.05) of the control concentration in SIN-1-
injected rats (Fig. 1A, B). The phosphorylation concen-
tration of tau at Thr231 was also signiﬁcantly increased,
but no change was seen at tau-1 sites (not shown). The
level of nitrated and phosphorylated tau was normalized
by total level of tau, the latter was also increased to 1.1-,
1.2-, and 1.1-fold of the control
levels at 24 h after
injection of SIN-1 (Fig. 1A, B). To further conﬁrm the
role of peroxynitrite, we injected uric acid, a natural
scavenger of peroxynitrite (65–68), into the rat before
injection of SIN-1. We observed that preadministration of
uric acid prevented tau from nitration and hyperphos-
phorylation (Fig. 1C, D). We also observed that the
hyperphosphorylation and nitration of tau was no longer
obvious at 48 h after the injection of SIN-1 (not shown).
These results together demonstrated that peroxynitrite,
produced by SIN-1, can induce in rat brain both tau
nitration and hyperphosphorylation within 24 h after
administration of the drug. The increased total tau sug-
gests accumulation of nitrated and hyperphosphorylated
tau.

To determine the effect of SIN-1 injection on cell
viability, we measured the cell loss by counting the nuclei
of the cells stained with Hoechst 33258. It was shown that
the average number of nuclei in the hippocampus was not
signiﬁcantly changed (P⬎0.05) after the injection of
SIN-1 (Fig. 1E). To further assess the cell apoptosis, we
stained the cells with the activated caspase-3 Ab. Almost
no positive staining was detected in the hippocampus of
the SIN-1- (Fig. 1E, left panel) and PBS- (not shown)
injected rats. As negative results for the activated caspase-3
were seen in both SIN-1 and PBS-injected rats, we injected
staurosporine (0.5 mM, 3 ␮l), a recognized apoptotic
inducer activating caspase-3 (70), into the rats to serve as
a positive control. Many neurons with activated caspase-3
were seen in the staurosporine-injected hippocampus
(Fig. 1F, right panel). These results indicate that the single
injection of SIN-1 does not induce signiﬁcant cell loss and
cell apoptosis.

Protein kinases involved in tau hyperphosphorylation
in SIN-1-injected rats

To understand the underlying mechanisms for per-
oxynitrite-induced tau hyperphosphorylation, we mea-
sured the activities of GSK-3␤ and MAPKs because
peroxynitrite has been shown to activate both kinases in
vitro, and both kinases efﬁciently phosphorylate tau at
Ser-396/404 sites. We found that although the concen-
tration of total GSK-3 was not changed, the concentra-
tion of Ser-9-phosphorylated GSK-3␤ (inactivated
form) was decreased to 44% (P⬍0.01), 39% (P⬍0.01),
and 41% (P⬍0.01) of the control levels after injection
of the rats with 10, 25 and 50 mM of SIN-1, respectively

(Fig. 2A, B). The activation of GSK-3 in the SIN-1-
injected rats was further conﬁrmed by 32P-labeling assay
of the enzyme activity. The results showed that the
activity of GSK-3 in rat hippocampus was increased to
2.1- (P⬍0.01), 2.5- (P⬍0.01), and 2.2-fold (P⬍0.01) of
the control levels (Fig. 2C) in response to the treatment
with 10, 25, and 50 mM SIN-1, respectively. It is also
reported that p85 is a target for peroxynitrite-induced
protein nitration, and this nitration may consequently
activate GSK-3␤ via inhibiting PI 3K-mediated pathway
(22). To test this, we measured the nitration of p85 by
immunoprecipitation and detected a signiﬁcantly in-
creased level of nitrated p85 protein in SIN-1-injected
rats (Fig. 2D, E) (P⬍0.01). These results suggest that

activation of GSK-3␤ may be involved in peroxynitrite-
induced tau hyperphosphorylation, and simultaneous
nitration of p85 may be an upstream regulator for the
activation of GSK-3␤.

Then the involvement of MAPKs family was mea-
sured by using activity-dependent antibodies (repre-

sented by phosphorylation). It was shown that the
concentration of phosphorylated p38 isoforms,
i.e.,
p38␣, p38␤, p38␦ but not p38␥ was signiﬁcantly in-
creased in SIN-injected rats (Fig. 2F, G). No remarkable
alteration was observed in ERK and JNK and the
concentration of phosphorylated-ERK was even de-

C, E, G, I, J) were shown. Activation of GSK-3 in SIN-1-injected rats was observed by decreased ratio of Ser-9-phosphorylated
GSK-3␤ to the total concentration of the enzyme (A, B) and by 32P-labeling assay of the enzyme activity (C). The concentration
of the nitrated p85 prepared by immunoprecipitation was elevated (D, E), and levels of the activated p38 MAPKs, including
p38␣, p38␤, and p38␦, were also increased in SIN-1-treated rats (F, G), but levels of p38␥ (F, G), ERK (H, I), and JNK (H, J) were
not changed obviously at the same condition. The results were expressed as the mean ⫾ se. (n⫽3) (B, G, I, J), mean ⫾ sd (n⫽3)

creased signiﬁcantly at 50 mM of SIN-1 group (Fig.
2H–J). These data suggest that peroxynitrite may only
selectively activate p38␣, p38␤ and p38␦ but not p38␥,
ERK and JNK. And the activation of p38␣, p38␤ and
p38␦ may contribute to the peroxynitrite-induced tau
phosphorylation in these rats.

Accumulation of nitrated and hyperphosphorylated
tau in SIN-1-injected rat hippocampus

To investigate the cellular distribution of both nitrated
and phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus of the rats,
we did immunoﬂuorescence staining and analysis by
confocal microscopy. We observed that in addition to a
signiﬁcantly enhanced immunoreaction of nitrated tau
in CA2 (Fig. 3A), CA3 (Fig. 3B) and CA4 (Fig. 3C)
regions of the hippocampus, two types of staining
proﬁle were observed in SIN-1-injected rats. First, the
nitrated tau was evenly stained in the cytoplasmic
compartment, and this type of staining proﬁle ac-
counted for the majority of neurons both in SIN-1-
treated (yellow arrow, Fig. 3) and vehicle-treated con-
trol samples, although the latter showed much weaker
staining (Fig. 3). Second, the nitrated tau was largely
accumulated in the perikarya and dendrites (white
arrow and Fig. 3D), as seen in AD brain (4); this type of
staining proﬁle was seen exclusively in cells of SIN-1-
injected rats.

The staining intensity for the phosphorylated tau at
PHF-1 epitope in SIN-1-treated rats was markedly in-
creased compared with that of control rats in CA3 and
CA4 regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 4). In the CA3
sector of the SIN-1-treated rats, the most dramatically
increased staining of PHF-1 was largely located in the
mossy ﬁbers (Fig. 4A); although immunoﬂuorescence
was also shown in cell bodies of the pyramidal neurons
(yellow arrow, Fig. 4A), the latter was not detected in
the control slices. In the CA4 sector of the SIN-1-treated
rats, the phosphorylated tau at PHF-1 epitope was not
only markedly increased in the neuroﬁbers but also
aggregated into the cell body and hillock of the cells to
form tangle-like morphology (white arrow, Fig. 4B, C).
The ﬂuorescence with PHF-1 was almost undetected in
the CA4 sector of the control rats (Fig. 4B). These
results together suggested that peroxynitrite could in-
duce not only tau nitration/hyperphosphorylation but
also tau accumulation in rat brain.

The involvement of proteasome in tau accumulation
in SIN-1-injected rat hippocampus

Figure 3. Accumulation of nitrated tau in the hippocampus of
the SIN-1-injected rats. Double-staining confocal microscopy
with n847 (green) and Hoechst 33258 (blue) were used. The
nitrated tau were evenly distributed in the cytoplasmic com-
partment of the majority SIN-1-treated and control sections
(30 ␮m), but the staining in the control was much weaker
(yellow arrow); accumulation of the nitrated tau (white arrow
and panel D) was seen exclusively in SIN-1-treated rats. Scale
bar ⫽ 20 ␮m.

To explore the underlying mechanism for peroxyni-
trite-induced tau accumulation, we measured the activ-
ity of proteasome in rats treated with 25 mM SIN-1. We
found that the proteasome activity was decreased to
39% of control levels after SIN-1 injection (Fig. 5A),
suggesting the inhibition of proteasome activity by
peroxynitrite. Next we analyzed the degradative nature
of the phosphorylated and nitrated tau by 20S protea-
some in vitro. We found unexpectedly that phosphory-

lated tau at PHF-1 epitope by GSK-3␤ (Fig. 5B) could be
degraded as efﬁciently as normal tau (even better at
4 h) by 20S proteasome (Fig. 5C, D). On the other
hand, we also observed that ⬃80% full-length nitrated
tau (⬃62 kDa) was not degraded by 20S proteasome
while the unnitrated tau was almost completely de-
graded at 4 h of the reaction (Fig. 6A, B). To further
understand the role of structural elements in the
proteolysis-resistant property of the nitrated tau, we

modiﬁcations of tau is not understood. Increasing
evidence suggests that oxidative stress is closely related
to nitrative injury in AD patients. For instance, a
widespread occurrence of 3-nitrotyrosine, an indicator
of peroxynitrite, in neurons of AD patients suggests
that peroxynitrite is excessively produced in AD brain.
Peroxynitrite is a strong oxidant, and it is formed from
NO and superoxide at a high rate. In AD brain, all
three isoforms of NO synthases (NOS) are aberrantly
expressed in different cell types and the expression of
NOS is structurally related to the formation of 3-nitro-
tyrosine, indicating that excessive production of NO
results in the formation of peroxynitrite (36). In addi-
tion, A␤ deposited as senile plaque in AD brain can
stimulate production of NO and superoxide through
activating microglia and astrocytes (37– 42). These data
together suggest that formation of peroxynitrite from
excessive production of NO and superoxide in AD
brain may be an upstream effector for both tau hyper-
phosphorylation and nitration. In the present study we
tested this speculation by injecting bilaterally SIN-1, a
widely recognized and commonly used peroxynitrite-
generating compound (25–30), into rat hippocampus.
We found that the levels of both nitrated and hyper-
phosphorylated tau were markedly increased after the
drug administration. These results indicate that per-

the hippocampus of the SIN-1-injected rats. Double-staining
confocal microscopy with PHF-1 (green) and Hoechst 33258
(blue) was used. Only weak staining of PHF-1 was seen in the
mossy ﬁbers of the CA3 sector in control rats, whereas
increased staining of PHF-1 was observed in the mossy ﬁbers
and the pyramidal neural cells of the SIN-1-injected rats

measured the secondary structure of nitrated tau by CD
spectra analysis. We observed a strong negative peak at
200 nM wavelength (Fig. 6C) representing a more
unordered conformation or a signiﬁcant change of
secondary structure in the nitrated tau protein. These
data together indicate that peroxynitrite may induce
tau accumulation through inhibiting 20S proteasome
and accelerating tau nitration.

DISCUSSION

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common neurodegen-
erative disorder. A pathological hallmark lesion seen in
AD brain is the intracellular accumulation of the ab-
normally modiﬁed tau protein. In addition to be hyper-
phosphorylated, tau in AD brain is also nitrated, but the
upstream factor(s) leading simultaneously to these

peroxynitrite. Therefore, we did not pursue the mech-
anism study for peroxynitrite-induced tau nitration. For
the mechanism of tau hyperphosphorylation, we found
that the activity of GSK-3␤, a crucial kinase involved in
Alzheimer-like tau hyperphosphorylation, was signiﬁ-
cantly increased in SIN-1-injected rats. GSK-3␤ is abun-
dant in the central nervous system. The active form of
GSK-3␤ accumulates in the cytoplasm of pretangle
neurons and its distribution in AD brains is coincident
with the sequence of development of neuroﬁbrillary
alterations (44, 45). Furthermore, GSK-3␤ was shown to
phosphorylate tau at multiple PHF-tau sites, including
PHF-1 and pThr-231 (46), and overactivation of
GSK-3␤ by inhibition of PI 3K led to tau hyperphos-
phorylation (47, 48). Therefore, activation of GSK-3␤
may play a key role in the tau hyperphosphorylation
observed in SIN-1-injected rats. It is known that the
activity of GSK-3 is regulated by the upstream PI3K/
PKB and nitration of the regulatory subunit of PI 3K,
i.e., p85, down-regulates PI 3K. The level of nitrated
p85 was signiﬁcantly elevated, which may at least par-
tially contribute to the overactivation of GSK-3␤ in the
SIN-1-injected rats.

In addition to GSK-3␤, the p38 MAPK family (i.e., ␣,
␤, and ␦) was also stimulated in SIN-1-injected rats. It
was reported that p38 MAPKs could phosphorylate tau
in a manner similar to the PHF-tau characterizing AD
(49, 50), and the kinases as well as its activator, MKK6,
were aberrantly activated in neurons containing ﬁla-
mentous tau in AD brain (51–54). A recently in vitro
study demonstrated that p38 could phosphorylate tau
at Ser-396/404 sites (55). These data suggest the in-
volvement p38␣, ␤, and ␦ in tau hyperphosphorylation
in SIN-1-treated rats. The activities of p38␥, ERK, and
JNK were not changed signiﬁcantly after SIN-1 admin-
istration, ruling out the role of these kinases in the
system.

We also found in the present study that both hyper-
phosphorylated and nitrated tau were accumulated in
the SIN-1-injected rats. According to the observed
morphological characteristics, we presume that the
hyperphosphorylated and nitrated tau might be pri-
marily deposited in the neurons. However, the possibil-
ity of the glial distribution of the modiﬁed tau was not
ruled out because the hyperphosphorylated (33) and
nitrated tau (4) were also found in the ﬁlamentous glial
tau inclusions, a prominent brain lesion of the tauopa-
thies (69).

To understand the underlying mechanism for the
observed tau aggregation, we designed to analyze tau
degradation by 20S proteasome according to the fol-
lowing reasons. First, 20S proteasome is structurally the
core and functionally the catalytic subunit of 26S
proteasome (73); therefore, interpreting the function
of 20S proteasome on tau degradation is signiﬁcant for
understanding the roles of ubiquitin-proteasome sys-
tem on the turnover of the particular proteins. Second,
20S proteasome presents independently in the cells,
and the amount of 20S proteasome is ⬃ 2.5-fold higher
than that of 26S protease (74), indicating the indepen-

Figure 6. Resistance of the in vitro nitrated tau to 20S
proteasome. Equal amount of normal
tau (treated with
decomposed peroxynitrite) and the nitrated tau (treated with
authentic peroxynitrite) was incubated with 20S proteasome
for 1 h or 4 h, as indicated, and tau degradation was
determined by Western blot. Increased resistance of nitrated
tau to 20S proteasome (A, B) and a strong negative band at
200 nM (C) were seen in SIN-1-injected rats. The results were

oxynitrite, generated from SIN-1, can indeed serve as
an in vivo mediator for simultaneous nitration and
hyperphosphorylation of tau as seen in AD brain. We
also observed that the abnormal modiﬁcations of tau
induced by SIN-1 were no longer obvious 48 h after the
injection. This suggests that the Alzheimer-like tau
alterations induced by single injection of the drug are
reversible. We did not observe any obvious cell death at
24 h after the injection of the drug, suggesting that the
acute tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation
might not be toxic to the cells. This is supported by
recent studies, which suggest that tau phosphorylation
and accumulation may represent a protective function
in AD (71, 72). AD is a chronic neurodegenerative
disorder, and thus the peroxynitrite-related oxidative
stress (7–12) may be a long-drawn event. Therefore, in
future study a prolonged infusion of the drug is neces-
sary to disclose the role of chronic oxidative damage in
AD development.

To our knowledge, nitration of tau induced by per-
oxynitrite seems to be simply a chemical reaction
(6,43), i.e., the reaction becomes stronger when the
protein is subjected to the environment with elevated

dent role and the signiﬁcance of the 20S proteasome.
Third, it has been reported that 20S proteasome can
degrade normal tau (35, 64), but the nature of this
proteinase on the degradation of the hyperphosphory-
lated and nitrated tau was unknown. We have demon-
strated for the ﬁrst time that 20S proteasome plays
different roles in degradation of hyperphosphorylated
and nitrated tau proteins (i.e., it degrades the in vitro
GSK-3␤-phosphorylated tau as efﬁciently as normal
tau) but the nitrated tau resists to the proteolysis by 20S
proteasome. We also found that the activity of 20S
proteasome was signiﬁcantly decreased in the hip-
pocampus of the SIN-1-injected rats. This result was in
agreement with the previous study in hepatocytes that
peroxynitrite directly inhibited the 20S proteasome
activity (56). From these data, we speculate that the
peroxynitrite-induced accumulation of the hyperphos-
phorylated tau is relevant to the inhibition of 20S
proteasome. A signiﬁcantly decreased proteasome ac-
tivity was also observed in AD brain (32, 57, 58).
Moreover, it was also reported that tau hyperphosphor-
ylation and aggregation were only transiently expressed
in okadaic acid-treated OLN-t40 cells, but hyperphos-
phorylation followed by proteasome inhibition led to
stable deposition of the ﬁbrillary tau (33). Our results
in vivo further conﬁrm the notion that the decline of
proteasome activity contributes to AD pathology, espe-
cially in the formation of tau aggregates.

Tau nitration is also implicated in the formation of
tau inclusions (4, 5). Although a recent study indicates
that nitration inhibits in vitro tau polymerization (59),
the present study gives direct evidence that nitrated tau
aggregates in the hippocampus in vivo. Mechanisms
leading to the aggregation of nitrated tau may be due
to both decreased proteasome activity and increased
resistance to the proteolysis; the latter may be relevant
to the structural alteration of the nitrated tau. This is
supported by a study showing that nitrated ␣-synuclein
is proteolyzed by 20S proteasome at a slower rate than
control; nitration also induces a more unorderly sec-
ondary structure of ␣-synuclein (60), which has similar
biological and biophysical properties to tau in both
normal and pathological states (61). Moreover, protea-
some inhibition is also believed to contribute to the
aggregation of the nitrated tau, because proteasomal
inhibition by lactacystin is associated with an increased
protein nitration and the formation of nitrated protein
aggregates (62). To understand the relationship be-
tween tau hyperphosphorylation and nitration and the
proteolytic characteristics of this type of tau to the
proteasome, we tried to simultaneously nitrate and
phosphorylate tau in vitro. But we found unexpectedly
that prephosphorylation of tau inhibited its nitration by
peroxynitrite and prenitration of tau inhibited its phos-
phorylation by GSK-3␤. The in vivo relationship be-
tween tau phosphorylation and nitration needs further
study.

Taken together, the present study has provided the
ﬁrst in vivo evidence showing that peroxynitrite induces
nitration, hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of

tau. The concurrent activation of GSK-3␤ and p38
MAPKs may be responsible for the tau hyperphosphor-
ylation while the combined effects of proteasome inhi-
bition and proteasomic resistance (for nitrated tau)
may be the underlying mechanisms for tau aggregation.
These results provide new insight into the deregulatory
pathways in AD pathology.
