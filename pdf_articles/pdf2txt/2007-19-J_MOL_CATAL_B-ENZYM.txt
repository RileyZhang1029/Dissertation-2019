Abstract

A puriﬁed preparation of the versatile peroxidase from Bjerkandera adusta was tested for industrial dye decoloration. This ligninolytic enzyme
efﬁciently oxidizes Mn(II) to Mn(III) and also exhibits Mn(II)-independent activity in the oxidation of aromatic substrates. It was able to decolorize
27 of the 41 industrial dyes tested. The presence of manganese in the reaction mixture did not enhance the decoloration rate, in fact for some
dyes the transformation rate was inhibited. On the other hand, the presence of mediator molecules in the reaction mixture generally enhanced the
decoloration of dyes that showed low activity without mediators, while the dyes that were decolorized rapidly without mediator were unaffected
by the presence of veratryl alcohol, acetosyringone or TEMPO as oxidizing mediators. The role of tryptophan 172 on dye decoloration was
investigated. Chemical modiﬁcation of tryptophan residues using N-bromosuccinimide drastically reduced Mn(II)-independent activity and dye
decoloration, while the Mn(II)-dependent activity was maintained. The loss of Mn(II)-independent and decoloration activities after tryptophan
modiﬁcation was not reversed by the addition of mediators. These results strongly suggest that the tryptophan 172 is involved in both mediator
oxidation and dye decoloration activities, and in Mn(II)-independent activity.

1. Introduction

Since the end of the XIX century several thousands of syn-
thetic dyes have been produced. The world annual textile dye
production has been estimated at 800,000 tonnes [1]. In the tex-
tile industry, it is estimated that 15% of the dyestuff is released
into wastewater efﬂuent [2]. Synthesized dyes are designed to
resist water, sunlight, sweat, some chemicals and microbial
degradation. Thus, many industrial efﬂuents are hardly decol-
orized by conventional wastewater treatment processes [3,4]. In
addition, many of the industrial dyes are toxic, mutagenic or
carcinogenic [5,6].

White rot fungi have been demonstrated to be good candidates
for a biotechnological process for xenobiotic decontamina-
tion. These ligninolytic organisms are able to metabolize a

wide range of chemical molecules, including chlorinated phe-
nols, pesticides, PCBs, dioxins, organophosphorus compounds,
nitrotoluenes, chloranilines, dyes, and other compounds of envi-
ronmental concern [7–9]. Their extracellular enzymatic systems,
which are involved in lignin degradation, consist mainly of
oxidative enzymes: laccases, lignin peroxidases (LiP) and man-
ganese peroxidases (MnP) [10]. Both peroxidases and laccases
carry out substrate oxidation by a mechanism involving free
radicals, and show low substrate speciﬁcity. These ligninolytic
enzymes are directly involved in the degradation of various xeno-
biotic compounds, including industrial dyes. Recently, Wesen-
berg et al. [11] have published an extensive review on industrial
dye decoloration by ligninolytic fungi. This review summa-
rizes the research results and prospective use of fungi and their
enzymes for the treatment of dye-containing industrial efﬂuents.

out Mn(II)-independent activity on aromatic substrates, and
is also able to oxidize various phenolic and non-phenolic
substrates such as 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, guaiacol, ABTS, and
veratryl alcohol, in the absence of Mn(II) [13]. Similar versatile
peroxidases have also been reported in P. eryngii [14–17],
Pleurotus pulmonarius [18], Pleurotus ostreatus [19], as well
as in Bjerkandera adusta [13,14,20,21]. Versatile peroxidase
shows high identity with LiP (58–60%) and MnP (55%) both
from P. chrysosporium [16]. The heterologous expression of
VP in Aspergillus nidulans conﬁrmed the ability of this hybrid
enzyme to oxidize Mn(II) and different aromatic compounds
in the absence of manganese [17]. This enzyme seems to
have a long-range electron transfer pathway similar to those
postulated for LiP [18]. The spectroscopic characterization of
VP by EPR and electronic absorption techniques showed a
protein-centered radical in the presence of hydrogen peroxide,
which was identiﬁed as a tryptophan radical [22].

In this work, the capacity of this versatile peroxidase from
B. adusta to decolorize industrial dyes is demonstrated and the
role of Trp172 on these reactions is investigated.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Chemicals

Industrial dyes were obtained from different manufactur-
ers as indicated in Table 1, and under different commercial
names. Acetosyringone, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), TEMPO
(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, free radical) and veratryl
alcohol were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Co. All buffer salts
and hydrogen peroxide were obtained form J.T. Baker.

2.2. Protein preparation

Versatile peroxidase (VP) from B. adusta UAMH 8258 was
obtained and puriﬁed to a single band on a Coomassie-stained
electrophoresis gel as described previously [22,23]. The puri-
ﬁed preparation showed Reinheitzahl ratio (Rz) (A407/A280) of
2.5, and speciﬁc activities for manganese peroxidase (MnP) of
105 U/mg protein measured by the H2O2-dependent formation
of Mn(III)–malonate complex [24], and for lignin peroxidase
(LiP) of 7.1 U/mg protein measured as veratryl alcohol oxida-
tion [25]. Protein concentration was estimated by using both the
BioRad protein reagent and also using an extinction coefﬁcient
at 407 nm of 77,000 M

−1 for the puriﬁed preparation.

2.3. Decoloration activity

Decoloration activity was determined by measuring the
decrease of the dye absorbance at
their maximum visible
absorbance wavelength. Dye concentration in the reaction mix-
ture was adjusted to 1.0 absorbance unit at the maximum
wavelength in the visible spectrum (Table 1). Reaction mix-
tures were prepared with 0.5 mM MnSO4 at pH 3.0 and without
manganese at pH 4.0 according the optimal pH reported for
pesticide transformation for both conditions [26]. The reactions
were started by adding 0.1 mM hydrogen peroxide and the decol-

oration monitored in a Beckman spectrophotometer model DU
650. All the experiments were performed in triplicate.

The effect of three mediators, acetosyringone, veratryl
alcohol and TEMPO, on dye decoloration was determined by
adding different concentrations of the mediator to the reaction
mixture and monitoring the dye decoloration at the maximal dye
wavelength. The reactions were performed in 50 mM malonate
buffer pH 4.0 and in the presence of 0.1 mM hydrogen peroxide.
Kinetic constants were determined in a 50 mM malonate
buffer pH 4.0 without manganese for Reactive black 5

software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).

2.4. Tryptophan chemical modiﬁcation

The chemical modiﬁcation of tryptophan residues was per-
formed using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), as described by
Spande and Witkop [27]. The effect of the extent of modiﬁcation
on VP activity was determined as follows, VP (25.9 ␮M) was
mixed with different molar excesses of NBS in 0.1 M sodium
acetate, pH 4.0. After 30 min of incubation at room tempera-
ture, reactions were centrifuged and extensively dialyzed against
10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Then, both speciﬁc Mn(II)-
dependent and Mn(II)-independent activities were determined.
The extent of NBS modiﬁcation on tryptophans was spectropho-
tometrically determined at 280 nm after alkalinization of the
modiﬁed VP sample with 10 N NaOH [28]. Because VP contains
no tyrosine, absorbance values were considered to correspond
to tryptophan. The measurements were carried out in triplicate
and expressed as percentage of the unmodiﬁed protein.

3. Results and discussion

Forty-one industrial dyes were assayed for decoloration by
puriﬁed VP from B. adusta UAMH 8258 (Table 1). Two different
reaction conditions were assayed; pH 3.0 with 0.5 mM Mn(II)
and pH 4.0 without manganese. These conditions were reported
as the optimal for lignin peroxidase-like (Mn(II)-independent
activity) and manganese peroxidase-like (Mn(II)-dependent
activity) reactions on pesticide [26] and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon [23] transformations. Twenty-seven dyes were
decolorized at pH 4.0 without Mn(II), and only 15 were decol-
orized at pH 3.0 in the presence of manganese. In general, no
signiﬁcant differences were found in most dyes in both condi-
tions. However, Acid black 194, Direct green 6, Reactive blue
18 and Reactive green 19 showed signiﬁcantly less decoloration
rate, and no decoloration activity could be detected on Acid red
51, Reactive blue 198, and Reactive red 141 in the presence of
0.5 mM MnSO4 at pH 3. Control experiments showed that VP
is needed as a catalyst for the decoloration.

By far the most efﬁcient single class of microorganisms to
break down synthetic dyes are the white-rot fungi, which are
mostly basidiomycetes [11]. The main challenge for enzymatic

decoloration of industrial dyes is the large diversity of chemical
structures among the synthetic dyes, which include polyenes,
polymethines, diarylmethines, nitro and nitroso compounds,
anthraquinones, and azo compounds. The last represent half of
total dyes used in industry. Several works on dye decoloration
have been published using whole cultures [29,30] or using the
well-characterized lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases
[31,32], laccases [33,34], and VP from B. adusta and P. eryngii
[15,35]. As expected, enzymatic decoloration rate is dependent
of the dye chemical structure [36,37].

Versatile peroxidase is different from P. chrysosporium
lignin- and manganese-peroxidases, because it can both
efﬁciently oxidize Mn(II) to Mn(III), and carry out Mn(II)-

independent activity on aromatic substrates, and has been found
in several lignin-degrading fungi [12–14,16,19,20,38]. As in the
case of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [23] and pesticides
[26], the presence of manganese reduces the decoloration rate in
some tested dyes (Table 1). Versatile peroxidase from B. adusta
is able to bleach Reactive black 5, an azo dye which was not
oxidized by manganese peroxidase from P. chrysosporium, in
the presence or in the absence of Mn2+ [14]. Paszczynski et al.
[37] found that some different substituted sulfonated azo dyes
were better oxidized in the presence of Mn(II) whereas others
were better oxidized in the absence of Mn(II). In addition, it
has been demonstrated [35] that Mn2+ acts as a noncompetitive
inhibitor for the oxidation of Reactive black 5 by VP from B.

adusta, according to the presence of two substrate binding sites,
one for Mn(II) and another on the protein surface connected to
the heme by long-range electron transfers [39].

A manganese-binding site has been described for man-
ganese peroxidases (MnP) from Pleurotus, Bjerkandera and P.
chrysosporium [40], and a long-range electron transfer has been
proposed for organic substrate oxidations [22,41]. These two
different catalytic sites, one for Mn and another for veratryl alco-
hol, have been demonstrated in VP from P. eryngii [41]. High
molecular weight substrates are unable to access the heme edge
and they may be oxidized indirectly by superﬁcial residues of
the protein where the substrate electrons are conducted through
an intramolecular pathway to the heme active site, as in the case
of lignin peroxidase [42,43].

Two azo dyes (Reactive black 5 and Reactive violet 5) and
two phthalocyanine dyes (Reactive blue 38 and Reactive blue
72) were selected for determination of kinetic constants under
Mn(II)-independent reactions at pH 4. Catalytic constants (kcat)

afﬁnity constants (KM) varied only slightly for hydrogen perox-
ide (6.8–10.9 ␮M) and more signiﬁcantly, from 22 to 89 ␮M,
for the different dyes.

Versatile peroxidase from B. adusta has been named “dye-
peroxidase” [44] because it is able to oxidize dyes directly
in the absence of redox mediator. We have been exploring
the use of oxidizing mediators with this enzyme, as used
for laccases [45,46]. Veratryl alcohol (the model substrate for
Mn(II)-independent or ligninase activity), acetosyringone and
TEMPO were tested at different concentrations (Figs. 1–3).
While the dyes showing high speciﬁc decoloration activity were,
in general, unaffected by the presence of mediators, the dyes
showing low activity were decolorized signiﬁcantly faster when
mediators were added to the reaction mixture. This decoloration
rate enhancement is dependent of the mediator concentration
(Figs. 1–3). The maximal increments on speciﬁc decoloration
rates were up to 2500% for Direct yellow 58, 2000% for Dis-
persed red 60 and 1700% for Vat blue 7 with the presence of
veratryl alcohol. On the other hand, the decoloration rate of
Reactive yellow 2 increased 390% with acetosyringone, and
630% with TEMPO as mediator. However, none of the dyes
showing low decoloration rate without mediator and showing
signiﬁcant increase in the decoloration in the presence of medi-
ator, reach the decoloration activity values of those that are
rapidly decolorized without oxidizing mediator. Nevertheless,
these results show that the use of oxidizing mediators could

enhance the peroxidase transformation of recalcitrant pollu-
tants, as in the case of laccases [45,47]. It is important to
point out that 13 of the 41 tested dyes, specially the disperse
type, were not decolorized by VP with or without mediator
(Table 1). These recalcitrant industrial dyes are: Disperse black
1, Disperse blue 56, Disperse blue 73, Disperse orange 30,
Disperse red 1, Disperse red 72, Disperse red 161, Disperse
red 167, Disperse yellow 3, Disperse yellow 54, Solvent yel-
low 16, Sulfur black 1, Vat red 10, and Vat yellow 46. The
absence of reaction with certain dyes could be due to the higher
redox potentials of dyes than those of VP and oxidized media-
tors.

Recently, the nucleotide sequence of VP from B. adusta
UAMH 8258 (GenBank DQ060037) has been listed together
with those previously reported for VP’s from Bjerkandera sp.
B33/3 (GenBank AY217015) [38,50], Pleurotus sapidus (Gen-
Bank AM039632) and Lepista irina (GenBank AJ515245) [51];
as well as P. eryngii PS1 (GenBank AF175710) [52], VPL1
(GenBank AF007223) [16] and VPL2 (GenBank AF007224)
[16]. The sequence of VP from B. adusta UAMH 8258 is sim-
ilar to these from Bjerkandera sp. B33/3 (98% homology),
showing only four different residues; Ile57, Ser93, Thr167 and
Thr323. Considering the high sequence homology, the phyloge-
netic proximity and the availability of crystallographic structure,
a molecular model has been constructed of VP from B. adusta
UAMH 8258 [22]. The crystallographic structures of versa-

decoloration speciﬁc rates without mediator are considered as 100%, and they
are shown in the legend of Fig. 1.

A redox mediator should have three properties: (i) it should
be able to be oxidized by one-electron directly from the enzyme
to produce a free radical, (ii) the produced radical should be
stable enough to diffuse and react with the target compound,
and (iii) it should have an appropriate redox potential. The three
mediators used are chemically different. Acetosyringone is a
phenolic compound, veratryl alcohol is a primary alcohol and
TEMPO is compound able to form amoxyl radical. The dif-
ferent mechanisms of oxidation mediated by several mediators
have been recently elucidated in the case of laccase [48,49]. It
seems probable that for the VP-TEMPO system the dyes are oxi-
dized via a persistent oxoammonium ion [49], the formation of
a phenoxyl radical could be involved in the VP-acetosyringone
system, and the VP oxidation of veratryl alchol produces veratryl
aldehyde.

tile peroxidase from P. eryngii (PDB 2BOQ), and the lignin
(PDB 1B80) and manganese (PDB 1MNP) peroxidases from
P. chrysosporium were used as template. The VP shows a typ-
ical plant peroxidase folding and, as in the case of VP from P.
eryngii, contains a binding site for Mn(II) constituted by the
residues Glu37, Glu41 and Asp183. The existence of two dif-
ferent binding sites, one for the manganese ion and another for
the dye, could contribute to the differences in the pH proﬁles
in the presence and in the absence of manganese in the reac-
tion media. Manganese acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor for
pesticide transformation [26] and for the oxidation of azo dyes
[15], showing similar values of inhibition constants for both
substrates.

The nucleotide sequence of VP from B. adusta UAMH 8258
shows two Trp residues and no Tyr, and from the molecular
model, VP contains a surface Trp172 that is structurally and
functionally equivalent to Trp171 of lignin peroxidase from P.
chrysosporium [53] and to Trp164 of versatile peroxidase VPL2
from P. eryngii. Compound I oxidizes this residue generating a
radical which is stabilized by the coupled oxidation of a reduc-
ing substrate [21,22,54,55]. This is the opposite of Mn(II), which
transfers the electrons directly to the heme through the propi-
onates, and Trp172 is oxidized through a long-range electron
transfer pathway as in the case of LiP [41,56]. A tryptophanyl
radical also has been detected in this enzyme and seems to be
functionally analogous to LiP W171 [22,57].

In order to determine the role of tryptophan 172 in dye
decoloration, a speciﬁc chemical modiﬁcation with NBS was
performed. At a NBS/VP ratio of 9.6 only 6.8% (±5.3)
of tryptophans remained unmodiﬁed, the Mn(II)-dependent
activity was unaffected 113% (±11), and remarkably the
Mn(II)-independent activity (ligninase activity) was drastically
decreased to 20.6% (±1.0) (Fig. 4). These results conﬁrm the
catalytic role of Trp172 in the Mn(II)-independent activity as
previously reported for VP [22,55,57]. Four different industrial
dyes were selected to study the effect of chemical modiﬁca-
tion on tryptophans on their decoloration. Two showing high
activity without mediator and in which the presence of media-
tor does not enhance the decoloration rate (Direct blue 199 and
Acid blue 185), and two showing low decoloration rate and in
which the presence of mediator signiﬁcantly increase the decol-
oration rate (Direct yellow 58 and Disperse red 60). Table 3
shows the speciﬁc activities of unmodiﬁed and modiﬁed VP
preparations on these dyes, with and without 10 mM veratryl
alcohol. The chemical modiﬁcation of tryptophans signiﬁcantly
decreased the enzyme capacity to decolorize the dyes showing

chemical modiﬁcation was performed in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.0 using
N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as modifying agent. VP solution was mixed with
different molar excesses of NBS and, after 30 min incubation at room temper-
ature, the reaction was centrifuged and dialyzed against 10 mM sodium acetate
pH 4.0. The Trp content was calculated as percentage of the unmodiﬁed protein.

high activity. The capacity of VP to decolorize Direct blue 199
and Acid blue 185 decreased 99% and 94%, respectively. The
decoloration reduction was not reversed by the presence of ver-
atryl alcohol as an oxidizing mediator. On the other hand, for the
industrial dyes showing low decoloration rate, tryptophan mod-
iﬁcation also reduced the activity but to less extent, 75% and
70% for Direct yellow 58 and Disperse red 60, respectively, and
no decoloration enhancement was detected in the presence of
10 mM veratryl alcohol. These results suggest an important role
for tryptophan 172 in the direct decoloration of dyes and also
in the oxidation of oxidizing mediators, and thus the effect of
mediators for the enhancement of dye decoloration. Though the
absolute rate of decoloration of some dyes, even in the presence
of mediators, is so low as to be of little practical use.

We can conclude so far that VP from B. adusta is able to
oxidize a wide range of industrial dyes. Dye decoloration by VP
does not require manganese(II) ion, and uses hydrogen perox-
ide as electron acceptor. The presence of oxidizing mediators
enhances the decoloration activity of dyes showing low decol-
oration rates, while no effect was found for dyes that are highly
decolorized in the absence of mediator. The chemical modiﬁca-
tion of the two tryptophans of the VP molecule disables it for
both dye direct oxidation and mediator oxidation. Thus the sur-
face Trp172 seems to be involved in VP-mediated industrial dye
decoloration, in agreement with a long-range electron transfer

by versatile peroxidase may improve the transformation of some
recalcitrant pollutants.
