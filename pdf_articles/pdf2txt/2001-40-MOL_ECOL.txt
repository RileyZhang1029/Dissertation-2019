Abstract
In an effort to link quantitative morphometric information with molecular data on the popu-
lation level, we have analysed 19 populations of the conchologically variable land snail
Candidula unifasciata
 from across the species range for variation in quantitative shell traits
and at the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal (r)DNA locus. In genetic analysis, including 21
additional populations, we observed two fundamental haplotype clades with an average
 0.012
pairwise  sequence  divergence  of  0.209 
within clades, suggesting the presence of two different evolutionary lineages. Integrating
additional shell material from the Senckenberg Malacological Collection, a highly signific-
ant discriminant analysis on the morphological shell traits with fundamental haplotype
clades as grouping variable suggested that the less frequent haplotype corresponds to the
, which we propose to regard as a distinct species.

interest (e.g. Bonnin 
1999).  This  is  probably  due  to  the  multitude  of  factors
shaping  phenotypic  traits  in  natural  populations.  The
phenotypic appearance is influenced in a complex fashion
by phylogenetic history, genetic drift, gene-flow, selection,
environment and developmental processes. The relevant

evolutionary  processes  are  supposed  to  take  place  in
natural populations and consequently should be studied
there  (Ritland  2000).  To  gain  information  about  phylo-
genetic  relations  and  population  processes  on  the
species level and beyond, effective neutral genetic markers
such  as  microsatellites,  restriction 
length
polymorphisms (RFLPs) or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
sequences  have  been  widely  used  (reviewed  in  Avise
2000).  This  information  can  be  used  as  a  background
against which the phenotypic variation can be compared
in  order  to  gain  insight  into  the  processes  shaping  the
phenotypic appearance.

populations. A strong population structure is most likely
found in species with poor dispersal capacity. Land snails
with their restricted vagility, therefore, appear very suited
organisms for the study on the issue of phenotypic evolu-
tion.  Phenotypic  variability  of  shell  traits  within  and
among populations of geographically subdivided taxa is
often observed in land snails. While qualitative differences
in shell colour and banding within Helicid snail species is
well studied in conjunction with molecular markers (e.g.
Arter 1990; Davison & Clarke 2000), quantitative variation
has  not  yet  been  explored  and  causes  much  uncertainty
about the evolutionary and taxonomical relevance (Kerney
& Cameron 1979). Substantial variation in shell morpho-
Candidula
logy  can  be  observed  in  the  small  land  snail 
unifasciata
 ssp. (Poiret 1801) throughout the species range
(Gittenberger  1993).  This  has  led  to  the  description  of  at
least four subspecies, based on differences in shell traits:
C. u. unifasciata
 (Michaud
C.  u.  acosmia
1831), 
(Bourguignat 1882). Studying the original descriptions of
the subspecies (Michaud 1831; Bourguignat 1882; Wagner
1933), it becomes clear that the authors refer to quantitative
rather  than  to  qualitative  differences  to  distinguish  the
taxa. Because this makes unequivocal identification diffi-
cult,  there  is  much  confusion  about  the  distribution  of
each subspecies, though most authors agree that there is
a (cid:212)geographical component(cid:213) in the range of each type
(Gittenberger 1993).

In this study, we use the genetic information from mito-
chondrial 16S haplotype analysis as a background to study
quantitative  morphologic  differences  at  the  population
level throughout the core species range of all described
C. unifasciata
 taxa. In particular, we focus on three questions:
(i) does the observed phenotypic variation correspond to
different evolutionary lineages? (ii) How is the phenotypic
variation  distributed  within  and  among  populations  in
relation  to  the  16S  variation?  And  (iii)  Can  we  identify
environmental variables that co-vary with population dif-
ferences in morphology?

Materials and methods

Samples and DNA extraction

Samples  for  this  study  were  collected  from  40  locations,
Candidula unifasciata
comprising the core species range of 
(Kerney  &  Cameron  1979).  Morphologic  analyses  were
performed on individuals from a subset of 19 populations
(Fig. 1 and Table 1). Within these populations, we tried to
analyse  all  available  samples  both  morphologically  and
genetically.  However,  for  some  individuals  the  16S
analysis failed at some point [DNA extraction, polymerase
chain  reaction  (PCR)  or  sequencing]  and  some  indi-
viduals were subadults and not suitable for morphologic

analysis. The overlap of both data sets was therefore not
complete.

Individuals  destined  for  morphological  analyses  were
photographed  (see  below)  prior  to  DNA  extraction.  In
total, 220 individuals were crushed with their shells in 10%
w/v laundry detergent solution for storage at room tem-
perature  and  tissue  digestion  following  the  protocol  of
Bahl & Pfenninger (1996). Additionally, we tried to extract
DNA  from  museum  specimens  that  were  apparently
sampled alive and contained dried remains of tissue. To
preserve the shells, they were soaked in laundry detergent
solution overnight and treated for 5 min with supersonic
to  detach  the  tissue  from  the  shell.  All  samples  were

Boehringer Taq-polymerase in 12.5 m L total reaction volume
with standard reaction conditions. Samples were amplified
for 10 cycles (92 (cid:176) C for 50 s, 44 (cid:176) C for 50 s and 72 (cid:176) C for 40 s)
and 36 cycles (92 (cid:176) C for 30 s, 48 (cid:176) C for 40 s and 72 (cid:176) C for 40 s)
after initial incubation of 90 (cid:176) C for 2 min 30 s. Both strands
of the purified amplification products were cycle-sequenced
with the Perkin Elmer Taq DyeDeoxy“ Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit following the supplier(cid:213)s protocol and read
automatically on the ABI Prism 377¤ sequencing device from
the same manufacturer. Sequences were deposited in GenBank
(Accession  nos  AF407841—AF408058)  and  were  aligned
manually  after  an  initial  alignment  with  the  clustal
option  (Thompson  et al.  1994)  in  the  computer  program
sequencenavigator (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems).

16S Pairwise distance statistics and maximum 
likelihood analysis

The 16S sequences were collapsed to haplotypes with the
collapse  1.0  tool  provided  by  David  Posada  (http://
bioag.byu.edu/zoology/crandall_lab). For the maximum
likelihood (ML) analyses, the best-fit model of nucleotide
substitution (TrNef + G) was selected using the hierarchy of
likelihood ratio tests implemented in modeltest 3.0 (Posada
& Crandall 1998). ML heuristic search was conducted with
100 random sequence addition replicates. Nodal support
was estimated using the bootstrap approach (Felsenstein
1985) with 1000 replicates. ML analyses were performed

divergence  frequency  distribution,  including  16S  rDNA
sequences from the Helicellinae species Trochoidea geyeri
(So(cid:151)s  1926)  (79  sequences,  Accession  nos  AF407751—
AF407829) and C. gigaxii (L. Pfeiffer 1850) (10 sequences
Accession  nos  AF407830—AF407840),  was  calculated.
Analysis of Molecular Variance (amova) was performed
on a matrix of pairwise Euclidean differences between haplo-
types, grouped after population of origin. The calculations
were performed using amova 1.55 (Excoffier et al. 1992).

Morphological analysis

Morphological  analysis  was  performed  on  adult  indi-
viduals of a subset from 19 locations (226 individuals) and
eight  samples  (38  individuals),  from  the  Malacological
Collection  of  the  Senckenberg-Museum  Frankfurt  am
Main, of the four presumed subspecies (Table 1). The data
set for morphological and genetic analysis overlapped
in  105  individuals  for  sampled  populations  and  two
individuals for the museum samples. The locations of first
descriptions for the subspecies C. u. unifasciata and C. u.
rugosiuscula are not very well described in literature, but
the  approximate  areas  were  included  in  our  sampling
scheme  (see  Table 1).  A  lectotype  locality  exists  for C. u.
acosmia (Gittenberger 1993) that was not sampled. However,
in the original description (Bourguignat 1882), neither type
locality nor distribution range were given. C. u. soosiana
was first described from Budapest/Hungary (Wagner 1933)
and is represented by two Museum samples. Individuals
were photographed through a Zeiss ZV8 binocular with
10·
  from  above,
always including a ruler on the image. The paper prints
were digitalized with a resolution of 300 pixel/inch.

  enlargement  from  the  front  and  30·

Variables  for  the  morphological  analysis  were  chosen
based on the original descriptions of the presumed sub-
species of C. unifasciata (Michaud 1831; Bourguignat 1882;
Wagner 1933; Gittenberger 1993). Eight variables repres-
enting  three  character  sets  were  measured  by  digital
image analysis from the individuals. Shell sculpture traits as
the first character set were measured through rib-spacing
as  an  average  distance  between  ribs,  coarseness  as  an
average distance between a base line and perimeter of ribs,
and regularity of ribs as the coefficient of variation of inter-
rib distances. Size independent shell shape (shape 1, 2 and
3) was assessed through the use of the first three relative warp
scores of a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) analysis (Rohlf 1995).
This geometrical analysis of shape was based on 55 land-
marks applied to an electronic image of the individual. The
height and breadth measurements of the shell were taken.

These  standardized  shell  morphology  variables  were
used  to  perform  a  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)
and discriminant analysis (DA), with statistica (StatSoft,
Inc. 1995). The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) type (A or B)
of  the  respective  individual  resulting  from  16S  analysis

' 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Ecology, 10, 2541—2554

was applied as grouping variable in DA. Museum speci-
mens  and  not  genetically  typed  individuals  were  then
classified  a  posteriori  with  equal  a  priori  probability  to
belong to one of the respective groups.

Euclidean squared distance matrices between all indi-
viduals were calculated for all standardized shell varia-
bles together and for each of the 10 variables separately.
These matrices were used to perform an analysis of mor-
phological variance in the same way as described above
for the distance matrix derived from haplotypes. Standard
deviations  and  confidence  intervals  of  the  M-statistics
were obtained by bootstrapping 100 times over popula-
tions.  Note,  however,  that  these  derived  F-statistics
(named here MST for distinction) cannot directly be com-
pared to Spitze(cid:213)s (1993) QST and similar coefficients (e.g.
Yang et al. 1996), because we have no information about
the heritability of the measured traits. Estimates of herit-
ability of quantitative traits were obtained in these studies
from elaborated breeding designs or a priori information
about relatedness. Such information was not available for
C.  unifasciata.  Hence,  the  presented  population  fixation
indices comprise not only their genetic component, but are
also indications of the total morphologic variance.

Associations between genetic, morphological and geo-
graphical  distance  between  populations  were  explored
through Mantel-tests on the pairwise population fixation
indices  derived  from amova  analysis  to  test  for  parallel
evolution  between  genetic  and  morphological  data  and
isolation by distance, respectively.

Partial least square (PLS) analysis was performed using
the  PLS  option  of  the  package ntsys-pc  version  2.2f  to
assess the correlations between the average population
values of quantitative shell traits on the one hand and environ-
mental variables for each population on the other.

Environmental variables

Information about long-term climatical conditions at the
sites  sampled  for  morphological  analysis  was  obtained
from the web sites of MeteoFrance, Deutscher Wetterdienst,
and Bessemoulin (1989). We used annual mean temperature,
annual mean precipitation, and mean precipitation during
the  months  of  June,  July  and  August  (summer  precipit-
ation), and altitude, latitude and longitude as variables for
each sampling site. The precipitation during the summer
months was considered to be important, because most of
the shell growth is achieved during this time.

for  the  morphologic  analysis.  Therefore,  our  morpho-
logical  analyses  comprised  a  large  part  of  the  genetic
variation present in Candidula unifasciata ssp. Base changes
and indels were observed exclusively in regions known to
be  variable  in  molluscs  (Lydeard  et al.  2000).  Accidental
amplification of nuclear copies of 16S target fragments
is  therefore  unlikely.  The  average  pairwise  sequence
divergence between haplotypes was 0.038 (0.065) (mean –
SD) changes per site. The topology of the ML tree strongly
suggested  the  presence  of  two  fundamental  haplotype
clades  named  A  and  B  (see  Fig. 2).  Analysing  each  clade
separately,  the  sequence  divergence  between  haplotype
clades A and B was 0.209 (0.009) changes per site compared
to 0.014 (0.010) and 0.022 (0.016) changes within clade
A  and  clade  B,  respectively.  The  16S  sequences
derived from the museum shells assigned to the subspecies
C. u. acosmia and C. u. soosiana clustered both in haplotype
clade A. Clade B haplotypes occurred only in populations
COU,  STB  and  ROG,  where  no  clade  A  haplotype  was
found.

The frequency distribution of pairwise sequence diver-
gence estimates including sequences from the Helicellinae
species C. gigaxii and Trochoidea geyeri, showed that the
level of divergence between sequences belonging to clades
A and B correspond to between rather than within species
(Fig. 3).

Morphological analyses

The  coarseness  of  the  ribs  was  0.036  (0.032)  mm  (mean
 SD),  their  average  spacing  0.147  (0.057)  mm  and  the
regularity 0.274 (0.105). The first relative warp score of TPS
analysis turned out to be a descriptor of a depressed vs.
globular shell shape (24.95% of total shape variability), the
second opposed roundish vs. elliptical apertures (17.87%)
and  the  third  score  represented  large  apertures  and  a
round  periphery  vs.  a  small  aperture  with  an  angular
periphery  of  the  last  whorl  (13.93%).  The  values  for  the
shell size parameters were 3.828 (0.554) mm for the height,
and 6.333 (0.854) mm for breadth.

Pairwise sequence divergence

[changes per site]

The first two axes of the PCA on all eight standardized
variables accounted for 26.5% and 24.1% of total concho-
logical variation. The plot of the factor scores on the first
two PCA axes shows that the morph-spaces of the museum
specimens assigned to C. u. unifasciata, C. u. acosmia and
C. u. soosiana overlap, whereas C. u. rugosiuscula forms a
distinct cluster (Fig. 4). However, the morph-spaces of all
museum taxa are interconnected or enclosed by sampled
individuals, thus forming a more or less continuous range
of conchological variation.

DA

Using  the  observed  fundamental  haplotypes  A  or  B  as
grouping  variables  in  DA  yielded  a  highly  significant
discrimination model (Wilks(cid:213) l
 = 0.168, appr. F[8,107] = 65.58,
P < 0.0000). All eight variables were retained in the model,
but the single root extracted discriminated the groups mainly
in correlation to the coarseness of the shell. The posterior
classifications of all individuals to clades in the analysis all
had a probability greater than 95%. The result of the DA is
in  concordance  with  the  results  from  haplotype  analysis
insofar as no morphotype associated with haplotype clade
A was found in a population with phenotypes associated
with haplotype clade B and vice versa. The haplotype clade
B morphs are found only in the populations COU, ROG and
STB in the south of the investigated area. Representative
individuals of each clade are depicted in Fig. 4.

The museum specimens classified as C. u. unifasciata,
C. u. acosmia and C. u. soosiana were all predicted to belong
to the phenotype associated with haplotype clade A; the

specimen  named  C.  u.  rugosiuscula  corresponded  to  the
phenotype exhibited by individuals of clade B.

Partition of molecular and morphological variance

Most of the 16S variation (89.47%) is partitioned between
clade A and clade B. There is moderate variation (6.92%)
between  locations  within  the  types,  but  the  populations
tend to be rather uniform (3.61%). In contrast, the morpho-
logical variance component between the clades accounts for
only 18.04% of the total variance. Most of the morphological
variation (70.63%) is due to differences between individuals
within populations, leaving 11.33% of conchological variation
for differences between locations within type A and B. All vari-
ance components were significantly different from zero.

In clade A alone, the FST between populations is as high
as 0.648 (0.038), indicating high phylogenetic relatedness of
haplotypes within and very little gene flow among popu-
lations. This is not matched by overall phenotypic simil-
arity  of  the  shells  within  populations,  where  MST  was
estimated to be 0.292 (0.042). This difference is similar in
type  B,  where  the  FST  was  0.777  and  the  corresponding
morphological  fixation  index  0.219.  All  the  above-
mentioned variance components were highly significantly
different from zero; standard deviations for clade B are
not  given  because  bootstrapping  populations  makes  no
sense with only three populations.

When  looking  at  the  measured  traits  separately,  the
picture becomes more differentiated in haplotype clade A.
Except for the regularity of rib spacing, all fixation indices
were significantly different from zero, indicating population

accounted for 79.8% and 16.8% of the total squared covari-
ance between the character sets. The first canonical axis
showed  that  populations  with  a  high  annual  mean
temperature lying in the south of the species range tend to
be  composed  of  individuals  showing  a  coarse  shell
surface  with  largely  spaced  ribs  and  a  depressed  shell
shape with a small aperture. The second axis revealed a

precipitation and shell trait variables measuring the size
of the specimen (see Fig. 5).

Discussion

Two genetically and morphologically distinct 
evolutionary lineages in Candidula unifasciata ssp

Substantial morphologic and genetic variation within and
among  populations  was  detected  in  the  present  survey
over the greatest part of the range of the taxon that was
described  as  C.  unifasciata  ssp.  The  PCA  on  the
morphometric data showed that the field samples used in
the  present  study  comprised  most  of  the  phenotypic
variance  described  in  this  taxon,  as  evidenced  by  the

inclusion of samples from the Malacological Collection of
the  Senckenberg  Museum  (see  Fig. 4).  Even  though  the
PCA  revealed  a  more  or  less  continuous  distribution  of
individuals  in  morph-space,  the  two  highly  divergent
haplotype clades in 16S analysis indicated the presence
of  two  independently  evolving  lineages.  The  sequence
divergence  between  the  clades  was  almost  as  high  as
between  other  Helicellinae  species  and  was  in  the
magnitude  of  those  reported  between  genera  of  other
gastropod  species  (Koufopanou  et al.  1999;  Medina  &
Walsh 2000; but see Thomaz et al. 1996).

Despite  of  an  almost  continuous  morph-space  when
looking at the overall phenotypic similarity, DA yielded a
highly  significant  discrimination  model  with  the  haplo-
type clade as classification variable (Table 3). This shows
that the haplotype clade of an individual is a good predic-
tor of its morphology. Moreover, DA predicted a posteriori
the clade membership of all individuals not screened for
16S variation with probabilities greater than 95%. This is in
concordance with results from the analysis of variance that
detected  a  significant  variance  component  among  the
clades that accounted for approximately 20% of the total
morphological variance.

The presence of two highly divergent haplotype clades
or evolutionary lineages is therefore in concordance with
morphological differences (Table 3, Fig. 4). This led us to
the conclusion that there are two separately evolving line-
ages in C. unifasciata ssp. This view is strengthened by the
observation that clade B, found only in populations ROG,
COU and STB from the southeast of France, occurs in para-
patry to populations of clade A (Fig. 1), but was not found
together  in  the  same  population  (Table 2).  This  obvious
absence of gene-flow between neighbouring populations
of clade A and clade B suggested reproductive isolation of
the  clades.  Additionally,  initial  surveys  with  allozymes
and random amplified polymorphic DNAs indeed showed
divergence in the nuclear genome as well (data not shown).
The  average  sequence  divergence  among  clade  A  and  B
equalled 0.209 changes per site. Even if we consider a very
high mutation rate of 10% per million years, we have to
assume that the clades diverged at least 2 million years ago.
Most species concepts (reviewed in Hull 1997) would recog-
nize clade B as separate species in the light of the presented
evidence. However, additional evidence, like crossbreed-
ing  experiments  and  analyses  of  habitat  differences,  are
needed to confirm the species status of the inferred clades.

Taxonomic considerations

Having  established  the  presence  of  two  genetically  and
morphologically  distinct  evolutionary 
lineages,  we
wanted  to  know  if  there  were  arguments  that  allowed
assigning  an  existing  taxonomic  name  to  them.  DA
predicted that the rarer haplotype clade B corresponded

' 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Ecology, 10, 2541—2554

to  museum  specimen  named  by  the  collectors  C.  u.
rugosiuscula  as  described  by  Michaud  (1831).  More
evidence for the association of the identified evolutionary
lineage  (clade  B)  with  this  taxon  arises  from  the
correspondence  of  the  morphotype  with  the  original
description and the fact that populations of clade B were
found  exclusively  in  the  type  area  ((cid:212)around  Aix-en-
Provence(cid:213), Michaud 1831). We will therefore refer to clade
B individuals as C. rugosiuscula hereafter. Specimen of each
population have been deposited in the Senckenberg-Museum,
Frankfurt/Germany (Collection nos 322884—322886).

The  museum  specimens  assigned  to  C.  u.  unifasciata,
acosmia  and  soosiana  have  overlapping  morph  spaces  in
PCA, which proposes that either the traits chosen by the
original describers did not define statistically distinguish-
able entities in the first place or that they were not precise
enough to allow successive collectors to distinguish them
unequivocally.  Corroboration  of  this  view  arises  from  a
DA that failed to yield a significant morphologic discrimi-
nation model while using the taxonomic designation of the
museum  specimens  as  classification  variable  (data  not
shown).  In  addition,  neither  PCA  nor  16S  analysis  sug-
gested that there were more than two objectively distin-
guishable groups of individuals present in our sample. The
16S  sequences  obtained  from  museum  shell  material
assigned to C. u. soosiana and C. u. acosmia belonged both to
clade A and were, in case of the latter individual, identical
to the widespread haplotype 4 (see Table 2). However, the
collectors  of  the  museum  material  might  have  misinter-
preted their findings and because the holotype locality
for C. acosmia is unknown and the lectotype locality was
not sampled, we cannot exclude that more than the two
identified  evolutionary  lineages  exist  in  the  southeast  of
France.

We will refer to all individuals with haplotypes of clade
A as C. unifasciata. All sequences from the 20 populations
that  were  not  screened  for  quantitative  shell  variation,
because  no  shell  material  was  available,  belonged  to
haplotype clade A. Since the haplotype clade has proven to
be  a  good  predictor  for  the  two  morphological  types,  it
was likely that these populations corresponded equally to
C. unifasciata. This confirmed our subjective impression
of  the  spatial  distribution  of  this  morphotype  during
the sampling.

The assignment of existing taxonomic names to genetic-
ally identified evolutionary lineages is difficult and arbit-
rary to a certain degree, especially when holotype material
for morphological comparison is not available. However,
additional  support  for  our  taxonomical  interpretation  of
the  presented  results  arises  from  Kerney  &  Cameron
(1999), where C. u. rugosiuscula is described on the basis of
shell characteristics as only a subspecies to C. unifasciata.
The  description  closely  matches  the  morphotype  associ-
ated with clade B.

Associations between 16S haplotypes and morphological 
variability within C. unifasciata

Portions of the molecular and phenotypic variation could
be shown to be due to an obviously long lasting separa-
tion  of  different  evolutionary  lineages  that  we  can
regard as separate evolutionary entities C. unifasciata and
C. rugosiuscula. As this was a rather unexpected result, we
could  not  adjust  the  sampling  scheme  towards  the
inclusion of more populations of C. rugosiuscula into this
study.  This  lack  of  data  prevented  us  from  exploring
further the spatial distribution of phenotypic variation in
this  taxon  and  to  compare  it  to  the  organization  in  C.
unifasciata.  An  initial  survey  of  the  geographical  distri-
bution of C. rugosiuscula suggests however, that there are
differences in habitat preference between the two lineages.
In the area of parapatric occurrence, C. rugosiuscula can be
found in more Mediterranean lowland habitats, whereas
C.  unifasciata  is  more  frequently  found  on  mountainous
grasslands. We are working on a study to quantify these
differences.

The  sequence  variation  exhibited  by  mitochondrial
markers like the 16S rRNA gene is presumably evolving in
a selectively neutral fashion. The spatial distribution of this
variation is therefore shaped mainly by recurrent popula-
tion processes like neutral genetic drift and gene flow as
well  as  singular  historic  events  like  fragmentation  of
populations or range expansions (Avise 1994). These issues
have  been  addressed  in  a  phylogeographic  framework
elsewhere; here we wanted to study how the phenotypic
population structure relates to the background pattern of
selectively neutral evolution at the 16S locus.

The results in Table 3 show that the MST estimates for
quantitative shell traits were significantly smaller than the
corresponding FST, except for the coarseness of the shell,
which  was  indistinguishable  from  the  latter.  This  shows
that the populations did not diverge phenotypically to a
level that should be expected from the estimation of neu-
tral drift among populations. If this variation is heritable,
the large proportion of phenotypic variation within popu-
lations  of  C.  unifasciata  could  be  maintained  by  a  fine-
scaled  spatial  population  structure  within  land  snail
populations  (e.g.  Bahl  et al.  1996;  Pfenninger  et al.  1996;
Arnaud et al. 1999) that tends to maintain genetic diversity
compared  to  an  equal  sized  panmictic  population
(Lacy 1987). Phenotypic plasticity, common in land snails
(Goodfriend  1986),  could  be  another  explication  for  the
observed level of intrapopulation phenotypic variation.

As mentioned above, the presented phenotypic fixation
indices  termed  MST  cannot  be  used  to  infer  directly  the
action  or  direction  of  natural  selection,  because  they  are
obtained from the total morphologic variance of the quant-
itative  traits  and  not  only  their  genetic  component  (see
Podolsky & Holtsford 1995). This has the consequence that

we cannot distinguish between the action of natural selec-
tion, direct influences of the environment and individual
random effects on the exhibited phenotype. The presented
estimates, nevertheless, put an upper limit to the possible
genetic contribution to the phenotypic among-population
variances. There are several approaches to estimate the rel-
ative contribution in natural populations. But they are only
feasible  with  elaborated  breeding  designs  (Spitze  1993;
Lynch  et al.  1999)  or  independent  estimates  of  within
population relatedness, using nuclear markers (Yang et al.
1996) to estimate the heritability of the investigated traits.
Both  approaches  were,  however,  not  practicable  here
because C. unifasciata does not breed in the laboratory and
information about the relatedness of individuals in popu-
lations is not available. Recently, Ritland (2000) reviewed
approaches to jointly estimate both heritability and among
population  genetic  variances  of  quantitative  traits  with
nuclear  markers  that  promise  much  potential  for  future
studies.

The results from the Mantel-tests indicated that the null
hypothesis of no association between population pairwise
FST and among population differences in shell traits could
not  be  rejected  within  C.  unifasciata  (Table 3).  This  sug-
gested that the observed phenotypic differences have not
evolved in concordance with the mitochondrial genome
and  resulting  phenotypic  population  structure  does  not
reflect  the  phylogenetic  history  of  the  populations.  The
significant  phenotypic  divergence  among  populations
must therefore have other explanations.

Associations between the environment and morphological 
variability within C. unifasciata (haplotype clade A)

The  results  from  PLS  analysis  showed  that  differences
between populations in some traits co-varied significantly
with long-term climatic conditions and information about
the  geographical  position  of  the  sampling  site.  Axis  1  in
Fig. 5  shows  that  shells  found  in  climatically  warmer
sampling  sites  in  the  south  tend  to  have  a  coarser  shell,
larger spaced ribs, smaller apertures and more depressed
shells.  This  association  allows  formulating  hypotheses
about the causes for these characteristics: in areas with a
more  Mediterranean  climate,  there  are,  despite  of
considerable mean annual precipitation, prolonged phases
of drought that prevents activity of the snails in order to
avoid  desiccation.  Like  most  other  Helicidae  (McQuaid
et al. 1979), C. unifasciata manages to survive such periods
aestivating at the roots of bushes, under stones or attached
to the vegetation. A small aperture, minimizing the area of
exposed  surface,  and  a  flat  shell,  allowing  to  penetrate
deeper  into  the  vegetation  or  under  stones,  could  thus
constitute a selective advantage by minimizing the loss of
humidity  under  water  stress  conditions,  as  discussed  in
Goodfriend  (1986).  Association  of  shell  shape  with

physical habitat conditions was found as well by Johnson
&  Black  (2000)  in  the  littorine  snail  Bembicium  vittatum.
Because of the independence of gene flow patterns and the
high  heritability  of  shell  shape  in  this  species,  they
conclude that this association is due to local adaptation.

An  adaptive  explanation  for  shell  sculpture  character-
istics is less readily found. Welter-Schultes (2000) found an
altitude dependence of rib density in Albinaria idaea, that
he attributed to the temperature gradient co-varying with
altitude.  Kemperman  &  Gittenberger  (1988)  proposed
humidity  and  temperature  related  effects  like  surface
water adhesion and shell permeability as factors influencing
shell surface adaptation in these species. However, the
formation of coarse, large spaced ribs on the shell surface
could  be  influenced,  at  least  in  part,  by  the  irregular
feeding opportunities forced by aestivation periods (Cameron
1970) and thus probably be shaped mainly by environmen-
tal forces. This view was corroborated by our observation
that the shell of C. unifasciata, after transferring them in a
subadult stage to constant high humidity in the laboratory,
grows much smoother.

The second axis revealed that sampling sites with more
annual precipitation were associated with small snails (see
Fig. 5). This was astonishing at first sight because a humid
climate  allows  more  feeding  activity  and  snails  should
therefore attain a larger size. A similar tendency of increas-
ing size with lower rainfall in small snail species was noted
in Goodfriend (1986), and explained as a potential adapta-
tion of the area/volume ratio to reduce the loss of water in
drier  areas.  Johnson  &  Black  (2000)  on  the  other  hand
found that the growth rate was highly plastic in B. vittatum.
Life history differences related to reproductive traits may
as well be responsible for differences in shell size, as shown
by  Madec  et al.  (2000)  for  Helix  aspersa  populations.  It  is
possible  that  C.  unifasciata  reaches  sexual  maturity,  after
which  there  is  no  further  shell  growth,  earlier  in  wetter
places in order to reproduce earlier. This would offer the
next generation the possibility to reach a bigger size before
winter. Early reproduction could thus constitute a selective
advantage because winter mortality in juveniles has been
shown  to  be  size  dependent  in  H.  aspersa  (Madec  et al.
2000).  Further  experiments  are  needed  to  determine
whether the size/precipitation correlation in C. unifasciata
is due to phenotypic plasticity in response to the prevailing
conditions or whether it has an adaptational significance.

Conclusions

We consider the phenotypic and phylogenetic divergence
between the two identified lineages as sufficiently large to
propose the presence of two distinct evolutionary entities
described  as  Candidula  unifasciata  and  C.  rugosiuscula,
though  additional  studies  are  necessary  to  confirm  a
species  status  for  the  latter.  In  the  absence  of  obvious

qualitative characters to distinguish the two lineages, only
the joint statistical analysis of molecular genetic variation
and quantitative shell traits was able to reveal this hidden
divergence.

On the intraspecific level, the correlation of among popu-
lation divergence to environmental variables in C. unifas-
ciata allowed formulating hypotheses about their adaptive
value. These hypotheses can now be tested in future stud-
ies.  Integrating  environmental,  phenotypic  and  genetic
data was thus a major step from observing and describing
patterns to the understanding of the underlying evolution-
ary processes.
