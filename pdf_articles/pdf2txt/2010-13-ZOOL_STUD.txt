Kurtis Jai-Chyi Pei, Yu-Ching Lai, Richard T. Corlett, and Kai-Yuen Suen (2010) The larger mammal 
fauna of Hong Kong: species survival in a highly degraded landscape.  Zoological Studies 49(2): 253-264.  
We spent 3 yr (2000-2003) surveying the status of larger mammals (> 0.5 kg) in the highly fragmented and 
degraded landscape of Hong Kong using 373 camera-trap sites distributed in 43 terrestrial wildlife habitat 
patches.  In total, 20 mammal species were recorded including 15 larger mammals.  The Malayan porcupine 
(Hystrix brachyura) and red muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) were apparently the most abundant species, while 
the crab-eating mongoose (Herpestes urva), Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla), small Indian mongoose 
(Herpestes javanicus), and yellow-bellied weasel (Mustela kathiah) were the least abundant.  The red muntjac, 
small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), and Malayan porcupine had the widest distributions, while the Chinese 
pangolin, small Indian mongoose, and yellow-bellied weasel were most restricted.  Many species were absent 
from Lantau I., despite its relatively large size (144 km2) and lower current human disturbance, suggesting 
past extirpations.  The key management need for larger mammals in Hong Kong is the protection and 
enhancement of habitat links between adjacent protected areas, especially the cross-border corridor between 
the National Forest Park in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province and the Country Park system in Hong Kong.

Southeast Asia  has  the  highest  rate  of 

deforestation of any major tropical region, and the 
forests that remain suffer from large-scale logging 
and widespread hunting (Sodhi et al. 2004, Corlett 
2007  2009).   A  recent  study  used  a  species-
area  model  to  extrapolate  historical  extinction 
rates for a wide range of well-studied terrestrial 
and freshwater taxonomic groups from the island 
of Singapore to the region as a whole (Brook et 
al. 2003).  It predicted the loss of 13%-42% of 
regional populations for these taxa over the next 
century, with at least 1/2 of these representing 

global species extinctions.  Among terrestrial taxa, 
the highest projected losses were for mammals: 
21%-48% of regional populations.  Most actual 
extinctions  in  Singapore,  and  thus  projected 
extinctions  for  the  region,  were  among  forest 
specialists, while species that prefer or tolerate 
open or forest-edge habitats have survived much 
better.  Overall, however, the prognosis for the 
survival of mammalian diversity in Southeast Asia 
is highly pessimistic.

Hong Kong (22°N, 114°E) is on the north-
eastern  margin  of  the  region  considered  in

the  above  studies.    In  many  ways,  it  can  be 
considered a “worst case scenario” for the survival 
of mammalian diversity.  Seven million people are 
crammed into a land area of 1100 km2 that has 
already seen at least 7000 years of continuous 
human occupation (Dudgeon and Corlett 2004).  
All  but  the  most  rugged  topography  has  been 
cultivated at some time in the last few hundred 
years and there is evidence for massive loss of 
top  soil  from  the  steeper  slopes.   As  a  result, 
although  Hong  Kong  has  a  forest  climate,  no 
substantial remnants of the original forest cover 
have  survived,  and  the  most  extensive  plant 
communities today are fire-maintained grasslands, 
successional shrublands, secondary forests, and 
exotic plantation monocultures.

Despite this long history of massive human 
impacts, surveys over the last 20 yr show that 
Hong Kong still supports a surprising diversity of 
plant and animal species (Dudgeon and Corlett 
2004).  The diversity hotspots of different taxa 
do  not,  in  general,  coincide  (Yip  et  al.  2004), 
suggesting that different groups have been affected 
in different ways by human activities.  Several 
general  factors  seem  to  have  been  important; 
however, in permitting the survival of wild species.  
One  major  factor  is  Hong  Kong’s  very  rugged 
topography, which has not only confined recent 
urban  development  to  <  30%  of  the  total  land 
area, but has also protected scattered pockets of 
woody vegetation from fire and cutting.  Another 
factor has been the local tradition of preserving or 
planting small forest patches (mostly < 4 ha) near 
villages for reasons of feng shui, the traditional 
Chinese theory for determining the most favorable 
location for settlements in order to bring good 
fortune (Yu 1992, Dudgeon and Corlett 2004).  
Both oral traditions and the floristic composition 
suggest that some of these feng shui forests are 
several hundred years old, and it is possible that 
some began as preserved fragments of the original 
forest cover of the region.  However, while feng 
shui theory protects the vegetation, it gives only 
indirect protection to the fauna of these forests.  A 
3rd factor is the relaxation of human impacts in 
upland areas over the last 50 yr.  The declining 
rural population, the progressive abandonment of 
agriculture, and the active prevention and control 
of hill fires have resulted in a great expansion of 
woody vegetation, so that secondary shrublands 
and forests now cover more than a 1/3 of the total 
land area (Dudgeon and Corlett 2004).  There has 
also been a big decline in the hunting and trapping 
of vertebrates over the last 20 yr.

Most of the well-surveyed taxonomic groups 
in Hong Kong are those that are known to survive 
relatively well in small forest fragments (plants, 
amphibians, reptiles, rodents, and many groups 
of invertebrates) and/or are potentially capable of 
reinvading when human impacts are relaxed (birds, 
bats, and butterflies) (Corlett 2000).  By contrast, 
the  study  reported  here  is  the  1st  systematic 
survey  of  the  larger  non-flying  mammals:  the 
taxonomic group that is most sensitive to habitat 
fragmentation and hunting, and for which many 
species have difficulty crossing large areas of 
unsuitable habitat.  Checklists have been compiled 
from casual sightings and a small amount of live-
trapping data, but the distribution, abundance, and 
conservation status of most recorded taxa were 
largely unknown when this study was initiated in 
2000 (Shek 2006).  The primary aim of this study 
was to fill in these gaps, by assessing the current 
status of the larger mammal fauna (body mass > 
0.5 kg) of Hong Kong.  Mammalian nomenclature 
follows Smith and Xie (2008).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
(SAR) of the People’s Republic of China (hereafter 
Hong Kong) encompasses a biogeographically 
arbitrary 1,100 km2 section of coastal southern 
China, along with adjacent islands (Fig. 1).  Hong 
Kong has a subtropical monsoon climate, with hot, 
wet summers and cool, dry winters (Dudgeon and 
Corlett 2004).  The mean monthly temperature 
near sea level varies from 15.8°C in Jan. to 28.8°C 
in July, and the mean annual rainfall ranges from 
1,300 mm at the driest site to > 3,000 mm on the 
highest peaks.  The geology is largely igneous, 
and  the  topography  is  very  rugged,  with  the 
highest point 957 m above sea level.  Natural open 
habitats in the Hong Kong region must have been 
rare, with coastal cliffs, beaches, and perhaps 
seasonally flooded riverine grasslands the only 
ones extensive enough to support a non-forest 
flora and fauna.

Although  early  human  settlements  in  the 
region must have had some impacts on the biota, 
the major period of deforestation seems to have 
begun following increased Chinese immigration 
in the 11th and 12th centuries (Marks 1998).  The 
process accelerated with population increases in 
the 16th and 17th centuries, and was essentially 
completed by the end of the 18th century.  There 
are no descriptions of Hong Kong itself before the 

Pei et al. – Larger Mammal Fauna of Hong Kong

mid-18th century, but earlier European visitors to 
the Pearl River delta region, west of Hong Kong, 
make no mention of forests (Dudgeon and Corlett 
2004).  Even the highest slopes were terraced for 
tea by the late 17th century, and probably earlier, 
and it is hard to see where any substantial area 
of forest could have survived in Hong Kong past 
that time.  The total forest cover probably reached 
a low point in the 19th century and again in 1945, 
when < 4% of Hong Kong’s total land area was 
forested, all in scattered patches of at most a few 
hectares in extent.  Since then, the forest area has 
gradually increased, by both planting and natural 
succession, to around 17% of Hong Kong’s total 
land area, with another 20% covered in secondary 
shrubland (Dudgeon and Corlett 2004).  Forest 
succession  has  been  most  rapid  on  the  lower 
slopes of hills, while the lowlands are increasingly 
urbanized, and the upper slopes are still largely 
covered in fire-maintained grasslands.

Modern Hong Kong exhibits a sharp contrast 
between  rural  habitats  and  very  high-density 
urban  areas,  with  only  a  small  area  of  low-

density suburbs.  Urban areas are therefore not 
a significant habitat for wild mammals, except 
commensal species, and were excluded from this 
survey.  Major habitats for terrestrial mammals in 
Hong Kong today include a variety of open habitats 
(cultivated areas, grasslands, shrubby grasslands, 
and shrublands) and forest types (lowland forests, 
montane  forests,  plantations,  and  feng  shui 
forests).  For this study, terrestrial habitats were 
delineated based on a land-use map generated by 
the Lands Department of the Hong Kong SAR with 
sub-meter accuracy.  Terrestrial land-use types 
were aggregated into 43 terrestrial wildlife habitat 
(TWH) patches, based on their contiguity (Fig. 
1).  The total coverage of the TWH patches was 
593.7 km2, which is about 54% of the total area of 
the entire Hong Kong SAR.  Patches vary in size, 
shape, and degree of connectivity.  Seventeen of 
the larger patches were surveyed, with a total area 
of 529.9 km2, which is approximately 89% of the 
existing wildlife habitat in Hong Kong (Fig. 1).

China) are a 1 piece system with a passive infrared 
sensor that is triggered by moving objects with a 
temperature different from the ambient air.  These 
cameras  were  used  to  conduct  this  survey  of 
larger mammals in Hong Kong from Sept. 2000 to 
Dec. 2003.  In total, 373 camera sites were set up 
during the study period, selected to cover different 
wildlife habitats in Hong Kong (Fig. 2).  To collect 
information more effectively, camera traps were set 
up at locations where there were animal trails or 
tracks.  The number of camera sites in each TWH 
patch ranged from 3 to 45 (X = 21.9; standard 
deviation (SD) = 12.5) depending on the size and 
the degree of habitat heterogeneity.  Cameras were 
installed 1.5-2.5 m above the ground overlooking a 
trail and were angled downwards at 25°-45°, since 
prior experience had shown that this arrangement 
is effective in detecting mammals over the full size 
range present in Hong Kong.  Film collection and 
battery replacement was conducted every 2-4 wk.

Many  studies  have  used  camera-traps 

to assess the status of terrestrial wildlife.  For 
individually  identifiable  species,  camera-traps 
can be used to estimate population densities by 
capture-resight (Karanth et al. 2004, Marnewick et 
al. 2008).  Since estimates from the mark-recapture 
method and the total number identified are strongly 
correlated, photographic rates (i.e., the number of 
camera days per animal photographed) are used 
to assess cryptic mammal densities (Carbone et 
al. 2001, O’Brien et al. 2003).  However, density 
estimates  from  photographic  rates  should  be 
used with caution, since independent estimates of 
animal densities at representative sites are needed 
for calibration and to evaluate the precision of the 
calibration (Carbone et al. 2002, Jennelle et al. 
2002).

In  this  study,  the  occurrence  index  (OI  = 
the number of pictures taken per 1000 camera 
working hours) was used to represent the relative 
abundances  of  mammals  at  each  site.    Serial 
pictures belonging to the same individual taken

during a short period (usually within 30 min) were 
considered a single picture-event to prevent the 
overrepresentation of a lingering individual.  In 
general, the higher the density of a species in 
the area, the more pictures that will be taken, but 
comparisons between species must be treated 
with caution because of differences in size, life-
form, and behavioral patterns.  Since the functional 
relationship between the index and density was 
not calibrated, the OI was not used to estimate 
populations but to indicate the relative abundance 
distributions between TWHs for each species.  For 
each species, the patch OI value was calculated 
as the average of all camera sites in the patch, 
and the overall OI value was the average of the 
patch OIs.  The patch OIs for each species were 
classified  into  5  levels  for  mapping,  based  on 
their deviation from the overall OI for that species: 
medium (within the range of overall OI ± 0.5 SD), 
low (less than the overall OI - 0.5 SD), moderately 
high (between the overall OI + 0.5 and 1.5 SD), 
high (between the overall OI + 1.5 and 2.5 SD), 
and very high (greater than the overall OI + 2.5 
SD).  Trap-site occupancy was calculated as the 
percentage of camera sites at which a species was 
recorded.

RESULTS

In total, 1,442,581 (range, 417-13,025 per 
camera  site;  X  =  3,868;  SD  =  2,718)  camera 
working  hours  were  completed  at  all  camera 
sites.    When  aggregated  by  the TWH  patches 
surveyed, the patch total camera working hours 
ranged 8,097-147,110 (X = 84,858, SD = 44,549) h.  
Twenty mammalian species were recorded during 
the survey period, including 15 larger mammalian 
species  and  Pallas’s  squirrel  (Callosciurus 
erythraeus).  The total number of pictures taken 
was 9,215 (Table 1).  The other 4 species were 
murid rodents and shrews, which could not always 
be distinguished in the photographs and are not 
considered further.

On the basis of the overall OI, the Malayan 
porcupine (Hystrix brachyura) (OI = 1.304) and 
red  muntjac  (Muntiacus  muntjak)  (OI  =  1.006) 
were the species most often photographed, while 
the crab-eating mongoose (Herpestes urva) (OI 
= 0.031), Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) 
(OI = 0.028), small Indian mongoose (Herpestes 
javanicus) (OI = 0.020), and yellow-bellied weasel 
(Mustela kathiah) (OI = 0.010) were the rarest 
(Table 1).  However, the trap-site occupancy of 
each species showed a different trend.  The red 
muntjac (71.2%), small Indian civet (Viverricula 
indica) (59.1%), and Malayan porcupine (54.2%) 
had the highest trap-site occupancy, implying a

wider  distribution,  while  the  Chinese  pangolin 
(5.9%),  small  Indian  mongoose  (5.9%),  and 
yellow-bellied  weasel  (1.5%)  had  the  most 
restricted distributions (Table 2).  Two species 
known to occur in Hong Kong and large enough 
for camera-trap detection were not recorded: the 
Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and greater bandicoot 
rat (Bandicota indica).  Both have highly localized 
distributions (Shek 2006).

When comparing the 3 major regions of Hong 
Kong, i.e., Lantau I., Hong Kong I., and the New 
Territories (Fig. 1), the distribution patterns (Table 2) 
and TWH patch occupancy rates (Figs. 3-5) varied 
among species.  The red muntjac, feral dog (Canis 
familiaris), and Chinese ferret badger (Melogale 
moschata) occurred in most patches and were 
the most widely and evenly distributed species in 
Hong Kong.  The wild boar (Sus scrofa) and feral 
cat (Felis catus) were recorded in all 3 regions, 
but were less evenly distributed.  The small Indian 
civet,  Malayan  porcupine,  masked  palm  civet 
(Paguma larvata), and leopard cat (Prionailurus 
bengalensis)  were  all  apparently  absent  from 
Lantau I. (as was Pallas’s squirrel), while feral 
cattle (Bos taurus) and the Chinese pangolin were 
absent from Hong Kong I.  The remaining species 
were confined to the mainland New Territories, 
where the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and 
small Indian mongoose were quite widespread, 

but the crab-eating mongoose and yellow-bellied 
weasel were confined to the northeast.

DISCUSSION

Hong Kong’s mammal fauna

Hong  Kong  populations  of  the  15  larger 
mammal species recorded in this survey have 
varied historical origins.  On the basis of their 
current and historical distributions in the region, 
9 species – the leopard cat, small Indian civet, 
masked palm civet, Chinese ferret badger, crab-
eating mongoose, Malayan porcupine, Chinese 
pangolin, red muntjac, and wild boar – are probably 
survivors of Hong Kong’s primeval mammal fauna.  
However, the wild boar populations may be mixed 
with feral domestic pigs.

In view of the relatively uniform structure and 
successional status of the major wildlife habitats 
in  Hong  Kong  (Lai  et  al.  2002),  the  irregular 
density distribution patterns of the large mammal 
species  (Figs.  3-4)  are  more  likely  to  reflect 
differing histories of decline, expansion, and/or 
colonization, rather than habitat variations.  For 
example, the feng shui forests, although small  
(< 4 ha) and usually adjacent to active villages, 
may have contributed to the survival of more or

less forest-dependent mammals during the period 
of maximum human impacts in rural areas.  These 
feng  shui  forests,  as  well  as  forested  upland 
ravines, may have served as temporary refuges 
during periods of maximal rural development and 
randomly  preserved  certain  populations.   The 

importance of history is supported by a preliminary 
study on the mitochondrial DNA of rodents that 
showed 3 different genotypes identified for the 
forest-dwelling Niviventer fulvescens collected from 
the 3 major regions, while no genetic differentiation 
was found in the more tolerant Rattus sp. collected

throughout Hong Kong (L.K. Lin unpubl. data).  If 
this explanation is generally true, then significant 
genetic  variation  among  at  least  the  3  major 
regions would be expected for other species that 
survived the period of minimum forest cover in 
Hong Kong.

Hong  Kong’s  rhesus  macaques  are  well 
within the native range of this species, but the 
current population was apparently established from 
introductions that began around 1915 (Dudgeon 
and Corlett 2004).  Pallas’s tree squirrel is also 
within the native range of the species as a whole, 
but populations in Hong Kong were established 
from escaped or released individuals of 2 exotic 
subspecies less than 40 yr ago (Dudgeon and 
Corlett 2004).

The  yellow-bellied  weasel  was  the  1st 
confirmed record for Hong Kong.  It is conceivable 
that  a  small  population  had  previously  been 
overlooked, but its current rarity and restriction 
to the northeastern New Territories, near the only 
remaining non-urbanized corridor for dispersal 
from adjacent  areas of  the Chinese  mainland, 
suggests it has recently colonized or re-colonized 
Hong Kong.  The crab-eating mongoose has a 
similar current distribution as the weasel.  Although 
this  species  was  present  in  Hong  Kong  in  the 
past, it was believed to have been extinct by the 
1950s (Marshall 1967, Hill and Phillipps 1981), 
and it is possible (but not provable) that the current 

population is a result of re-colonization by the 
same route as the yellow-bellied weasel.  The 
small Indian mongoose was first definitely recorded 
in Hong Kong in the 1980s and is now abundant 
in the Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve (outside 
our survey area) and widespread throughout the 
central and northern New Territories (Dudgeon and 
Corlett 2004).  It is a conspicuous diurnal animal 
in open habitats so it seems improbable that it 
was previously overlooked, but there is insufficient 
information  to  distinguish  between  natural 
colonization from the mainland and a deliberate 
introduction.

Feral cats, dogs, and cattle are apparently 
also recent additions to Hong Kong’s mammalian 
fauna, with feral cattle, in particular, only becoming 
established within the last 2 decades following their 
abandonment as farming became uneconomic 
(Dudgeon and Corlett 2004).  Near the margins 
of urban areas, many of the dogs may be 1st-
generation strays, but those in more-remote rural 
areas seem to be genuinely feral.  Feral dogs 
are now the most widespread carnivore species 
in Hong Kong, but feral cats have a much more 
restricted distribution, being widespread only on 
Lantau I., where the ecologically similar leopard 
cat is absent.

casual sightings, it is unlikely that any other large 
mammal species survive in inland habitats in Hong 
Kong.  Four carnivore species reliably recorded in 
the last century, tiger, leopard, large Indian civet, 
and red fox, are undoubtedly extinct.  Excluding 
these extinct species, the addition of the squirrel, 
plus 8 species of murid rodents (including 5 or 
6 commensals) and 2 species of shrew (Chung 
and Corlett 2006), gives a total current non-volant 
terrestrial mammal fauna of 26 species.  A 27th 
species, the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) occurs in 
very small numbers in the coastal Mai Po Marshes 
Nature Reserve in northwestern Hong Kong (Shek 
2006).  In addition, 26 bat species have been 
recorded in Hong Kong (Shek and Chan 2006), to 
give a total of 53 terrestrial mammal species.

It  is  almost  certain  that  other  mammalian 
species  became  extinct  in  Hong  Kong  before 
local records began, including flying squirrels and 
additional species of primates, carnivores, and 
terrestrial herbivores (Corlett 2006), although there 
is no direct evidence for most of these taxa.  The 
known and inferred extinctions were mostly either 
a danger to people, their livestock, or their crops 
(tigers, leopards, dholes, bears, and elephants), 
highly valued in traditional medicine (tigers and 
rhinoceroses), preferred prey of hunters (primates, 
large deer, and civets), and/or highly dependent 
on forest (primates, flying squirrels, and other 
forest rodents).  The survivors have few things in 
common, but they are all relatively small and all 
capable of utilizing non-forest habitats at least to 
some extent.

The spatial distribution of larger mammals in 
Hong Kong

The most striking feature of the geographical 
distribution of larger mammals in Hong Kong is the 
absence of many species from Lantau I., despite 
its  relatively  large  size  (144  km2)  and  rugged 
topography that has confined development to a 
narrow coastal strip.  The absence of macaques 
and tree squirrels probably reflects the absence 
of deliberate introductions, while the absence of 
the  small  Indian  mongoose  and  yellow-bellied 
weasel is also not surprising if they have colonized 
Hong Kong only recently.  However, Lantau also 
has  neither  civet  species,  nor  leopard  cats  or 
porcupines,  all  of  which  occur  on  the  smaller  
(78 km2) and more-developed Hong Kong I.  It is 
possible that some of these species were never 
present on Lantau I., but it seems more likely that 
they were extirpated and have been unable to 

recolonize across the marine barrier, although this 
does not explain their survival on Hong Kong I.  
Indeed, porcupines have been recorded on several 
islands of < 2 km2 in area (Reels 1996).  Within 
the mainland New Territories, which supports all of 
the recorded mammal species, most species are 
widespread, except for those that are likely to be 
recent invasions or introductions.

One interesting observation is that nearly 
1/2 of the existing larger mammals in Hong Kong 
are typically forest edge and open-area species 
elsewhere  (Table  2),  which  was  not  expected 
for  such  a  highly  urbanized  area  where  city 
boundaries are usually immediately adjacent to 
forest edges.  A recent study at Kenting National 
Park (22°N, 121°E), Taiwan, at a similar latitude, 
found the opposite: despite high wildlife habitat 
coverage (80% forest and 13% open habitats; 
Chen and Chung 2003), 80% (4/5) of forest-edge 
and open-area species, including the Chinese 
pangolin, small Indian civet (Francis 2008, Chen et 
al. 2009), leopard cat, and the sika deer (Cervus 
nippon taiouanus), became locally extinct when 
intensive human development near forest edges 
occurred during the past century (Pei 2004).  As 
mentioned earlier, both spontaneous and managed 
reforestation has been much faster in the foothills 
than in higher elevations in Hong Kong, and these 
foothill  forests  may  have  buffered  these  edge 
species.  An analysis of landscape elements would 
be helpful to test this hypothesis.

Implications for conservation

Among native mammals, both civet species, 
the  ferret  badger,  red  muntjac,  wild  boar,  and 
Malayan porcupine are widespread and abundant 
in  existing  protected  areas,  and  thus  of  least 
current conservation concern.  The only obvious 
threat would be from fragmentation of the existing 
populations  if  future  development  of  the  road 
system severed existing links between Country 
Parks.  Currently, the only barrier between adjacent 
Country Parks is typically a secondary road that is 
relatively quiet at night.  Regular sightings and road 
kills show that the surviving large mammal species 
cross such roads, but widening or increased traffic 
could change this.

The leopard cat is widespread but apparently 
less  abundant  than  the  preceding  species.  
Additional research is needed to determine if the 
Hong Kong populations are viable, particularly that 
on Hong Kong I.  Although the Chinese pangolin 
is  widespread,  only  31  pictures  were  taken  in 

262

Zoological Studies 49(2): 253-264 (2010)

total.    If  this  is  an  accurate  indication  of  the 
abundance of this species, then the pangolin will 
need active conservation support, and population 
recovery measures should be considered.  Natural 
dispersal into adjacent Country Parks is possible 
for  the  pangolin  once  the  population  density 
increases; however, to encourage the movement, 
active  microhabitat  management  should  also 
be undertaken in surrounding areas.  There are 
no recent records of this species being trapped 
or  hunted  in  Hong  Kong,  but  given  its  high 
commercial value this remains a potential threat.

The crab-eating mongoose and yellow-bellied 
weasel have similar restricted distributions in the 
northeastern New Territories.  The low numbers of 
both species suggest that, like the pangolin, they 
will need active conservation support to survive, 
including  possible  reinforcement  by  additional 
individuals  from  the  nearest  wild  population 
north of the Hong Kong border.  The small Indian 
mongoose was also rarely photographed in this 
survey, but it favors non-forested habitats that 
were not intensively surveyed, so its abundance 
was certainly underestimated.  Native or not, this 
species is currently of no conservation concern.

The  population  of  rhesus  macaques  (and 
hybrids with released exotic long-tailed macaques, 
Macaca fascicularis) is currently expanding at a 
rate > 5% per year and was expected to reach 
2,000 individuals by the year 2007 (Wong and 
Chow 2004).  Aggressive encounters with park 
visitors continue to be a problem, despite a ban on 
feeding implemented in 1999, but this species is 
clearly of no conservation concern.

The remaining 3 large mammal species are 
feral populations of domesticated animals.  Packs 
of feral dogs are present throughout the protected 
area system, apparently as self-sustaining wild 
populations, although they intergrade with urban 
strays (Dudgeon and Corlett 2004).  In addition 
to  consuming  waste  human  food,  both  field 
observations and photographic evidence show that 
they kill civets, muntjacs, and porcupines, making 
them the top mammalian carnivore in Hong Kong.  
In view of the expense and difficulty of effective 
dog control, research is urgently needed to assess 
the severity of their impacts on prey populations.  
Feral cats are less abundant and some of the 
pictures in this survey may be of wide-ranging 
domestic cats.  Most are relatively small animals, 
and their wild prey is likely to consist only of small 
vertebrates, such as rats, mice, shrews, and birds.  
However, their possible conflicts with the leopard 
cat population should not be overlooked.  Feral 

cattle are the largest wild mammals in modern 
Hong Kong.  Their numbers have increased rapidly 
over the last decade as a result of breeding, rather 
than additional releases, and they are spreading 
into previously unoccupied areas.  Their impacts 
on  the  vegetation  of  open  areas  and  forest 
understory are obvious, both by trampling and by 
selective grazing and browsing, and they appear to 
facilitate the invasion of exotic plant species (Leung 
et al. 2009).  Again, further research is needed into 
both their current impacts and  possible means of 
control.

The  impoverished  mammalian  fauna  of 
Lantau I. provides a unique opportunity for the 
experimental reintroduction of missing taxa into 
a well-studied mammal community.  Among the 
missing carnivores, the leopard cat is an obvious 
target,  as  a  species  of  potential  conservation 
concern, but this would require finding a source 
of surplus individuals in the Hong Kong region.  
An alternative or additional possibility would be to 
reintroduce one or both of the carnivores that were 
lost from Hong Kong in the 1950s, the red fox and 
the large Indian civet.  Interactions between any 
carnivore introductions and the established feral 
cat population would be of particular interest.

Hong Kong’s protected area system already 
includes > 40% of the total land area (Fig. 2), with 
an additional ca. 20% protected from development 
by rugged topography.  As far as large mammals 
are  concerned,  the  key  management  need  is 
the  protection  and,  if  possible,  enhancement, 
of the links between adjacent protected areas, 
most of which are probably too small to support 
viable populations on their own.  Radio-telemetry 
studies are needed to understand how these links 
are used at present.  Habitat improvements and 
the protection of small additional areas may be 
needed to ensure that wildlife movements within 
Hong  Kong  continue  to  be  possible.   The  last 
potential corridor for terrestrial wildlife movements 
between the rest of China and Hong Kong is in the 
northeastern New Territories, where rural habitats 
in Hong Kong’s Frontier Closed Area abut similar 
habitats on the Shenzhen side of the border fence, 
especially the Sha Tau Kok area (Fig. 1), providing 
a link between Shenzhen’s 31 km2 Wutongshan 
National Forest Park and Hong Kong’s Country 
Park system.  None of this corridor receives formal 
protection at present, so development is a constant 
threat.  Urgent consideration should be given to 
preserving this link.

CONCLUSIONS

The main general conclusion from this study 
is that a diverse mammalian fauna can persist in 
a highly degraded tropical Asian landscape.  But 
how  typical  is  Hong  Kong?    Most  other  areas 
of  tropical  East Asia  with  a  similar  degree  of 
landscape degradation appear to have much more 
highly impoverished mammalian faunas (pers. obs. 
by the authors), although no intensive surveys 
were done.  If these apparent differences are real, 
they almost certainly reflect the absence of recent 
hunting pressure in Hong Kong and its prevalence 
throughout almost all the rest of the region (Corlett 
2007 2009).  Hong Kong thus shows the potential 
for such landscapes, but not the current situation 
in most of them.

The large differences between the current 
distributions  of  mammal  species  within  Hong 
Kong  suggest  that  historical  accidents  played 
major  roles  in  the  composition  of  the  fauna, 
with individual species expanding from their last 
refuges or reinvading Hong Kong after a relaxation 
of human pressures in rural areas over the last few 
decades.  We expect the same pattern to prevail 
elsewhere in tropical Asia when human pressures 
relax over the next 30-50 yr as a result of declining 
birth rates and rural-urban migration.  This in turn 
suggests that there will be many opportunities for 
conservation interventions to ensure that the newly 
available habitats are re-occupied with their full 
potential of mammalian faunas.  Hong Kong is an 
ideal place to practice this.
