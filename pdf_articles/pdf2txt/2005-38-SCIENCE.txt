A defect in Klotho gene expression in mice accelerates the degeneration of
multiple age-sensitive traits. Here, we show that overexpression of Klotho in
mice extends life span. Klotho protein functions as a circulating hormone that
binds to a cell-surface receptor and represses intracellular signals of insulin and
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for
extending life span. Alleviation of aging-like phenotypes in Klotho-deficient mice
was observed by perturbing insulin and IGF1 signaling, suggesting that Klotho-
mediated inhibition of insulin and IGF1 signaling contributes to its anti-aging
properties. Klotho protein may function as an anti-aging hormone in mammals.

Klotho was originally identified as a mutated
gene in a mouse strain that accelerates age-
dependent loss of function in multiple age-
sensitive traits (1). An insertional mutation that

disrupts the 5¶ promoter region of the Klotho
gene resulted in a strong hypomorphic allele.
Mice homozygous for the mutated allele (KLj/j
mice) appeared normal until 3 to 4 weeks old

but then began to manifest multiple age-related
disorders observed in humans, including ectop-
ic calcification, skin atrophy, muscle atrophy,
osteoporosis, arteriosclerosis, and pulmonary
emphysema. KLj/j mice suffered premature
death around two months of age.

The Klotho gene encodes a single-pass
transmembrane protein that
is detectable in
limited tissues, particularly the distal con-
voluted tubules in the kidney and the choroid
plexus in the brain. Because a defect in the
Klotho gene leads to systemic age-dependent

degeneration, the Klotho protein may function
through a circulating humoral factor that reg-
ulates the development of age-related disorders
or natural aging processes (2). Notably, some
single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human
KLOTHO gene are associated with altered life
span (3) and altered risk for coronary artery
disease (4), osteoporosis (5–7), and stroke (8).
Little is known about Klotho protein function
and the molecular mechanism by which it
suppresses the development of aging-like pheno-
types. The extracellular domain of Klotho protein

is composed of two internal repeats, KL1 and
KL2, that share amino acid sequence homology
to b-glucosidases of bacteria and plants (20 to
40% identity) (1). However, glucosidase activity
is not present in recombinant Klotho protein (9),
and the essential glutamate residue at the b-
glucosidase active center is replaced with
asparagine and alanine in KL1 and KL2,
respectively (10). Here, we demonstrate that
Klotho is an aging suppressor gene whose
product functions as a hormone that inhibits
intracellular insulin and IGF1 signaling.

Klotho overexpression extends life
span in mice. We previously generated
independent transgenic lines of mice that over-
express Klotho under the control of the human
elongation factor 1a promoter (1) (EFmKL46
and EFmKL48) (fig. S1). Here, we compared
the life span of the transgenic mice with that of
wild-type controls that are near-coisogenic by
virtue of backcrossing onto the C3H back-
ground four times. Each line was previously
confirmed to express functional Klotho protein
from the transgene (1). Mice carrying the

ad libitum, outlived wild-type controls by 20.0
and 30.8%, respectively, in males (Fig. 1A)
and by 18.8 and 19.0%, respectively,
in
females (Fig. 1B).

Caloric restriction is associated with in-
creased longevity in various species (11). To
assess whether mice overexpressing Klotho
were restricting their own diets, we monitored

food intake and oxygen consumption in
transgenic and wild-type mice for 24 hours at
32 to 36 weeks of age. No significant differ-
ences in these parameters were observed (table
S1). Small body size is also associated with
extended longevity in diet-restricted mice and
in mice that are mutant for pituitary or growth
hormone receptor function (12, 13). However,
we did not observe any substantial difference

in growth between EFmKL46, EFmKL48 , and
wild-type mice (Fig. 1C). Both EFmKL46 and
EFmKL48 breeding pairs generated fewer
offspring than wild-type breeding pairs (Fig.
1D). As expected from the evolutionary theory
of longevity, maximum fitness of the organism
is a trade-off between life span and fertility
(14). These data indicate that Klotho system-
ically modulates aging through mechanisms
independent of food intake and growth, but
potentially in association with reproduction.

Klotho increases resistance to insulin
and IGF1. Many genetic data demonstrate
that
inhibited insulin and IGF1 signaling
extends life span in animals from C. elegans,
to Drosophila,
to mice (15–21). Because
Klotho must mediate aging through effects of
a systemic hormone, we investigated whether
the Klotho gene is involved in the inhibition of
insulin or IGF1 signaling. Mice defective in
Klotho gene expression have reduced blood
glucose and insulin levels coupled with en-
hanced sensitivity to insulin (22).

We compared glucose metabolism in the
Klotho-overexpressing transgenic mice with
wild-type animals. Blood glucose levels were
normal
in each transgenic line (Fig. 2A).
However, male EFmKL46 and EFmKL48 mice
had higher blood insulin levels than did wild-
type males (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the male
transgenic mice are somewhat insulin resistant.
We directly assessed sensitivity to insulin with
a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (23). As
expected, male EFmKL46 and EFmKL48 mice
required lower glucose infusion rates than did
wild-type males to maintain normal blood
glucose levels (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, insulin
and IGF1 tolerance tests revealed significant
attenuation in hypoglycemic response to
injected insulin and IGF1 in male transgenic
mice (Fig. 2, D and E). Although we were
unable to detect insulin resistance in female
transgenic mice (Fig. 2, C and D), they were
significantly resistant to IGF1 (Fig. 2E). These
studies demonstrate that Klotho overexpression
induces resistance to insulin and IGF1.

Klotho functions as a hormone. The
extracellular domain of Klotho is shed on the
cell surface and detected in the blood and
cerebrospinal fluid in mice and humans (24).
Immunoblot analysis of plasma with the use
of rabbit anti-Klotho antiserum demonstrated
that the extracellular Klotho peptide can be
detected in wild-type, EFmKL48, and EFmKL46
mice but not in KLj/j mice (fig. S2). Radio-
immunoassay further demonstrated that Klotho
peptide is È100 pM in wild-type mice and
about
two times as high in the transgenic
overexpression strains (fig. S3). The extra-
cellular domain of Klotho may function as a
hormone-like substance (2).

To assess the function of the Klotho extra-
cellular peptide, we generated a soluble form
of recombinant Klotho protein comprising the
952–amino acid extracellular domain, and de-

termined whether this promoted insulin resist-
ance when injected into mice. Intraperitoneal
injection of insulin (0.5 U/kg) and purified
Klotho extracellular peptide (10 mg/kg, Fig.
2F) in wild-type male and female mice atten-
uated the hypoglycemic response expected
from insulin alone (Fig. 2G). Klotho peptide
alone rapidly increased blood glucose levels in
male wild-type mice and to a smaller extent in
females (Fig. 2H). However, Klotho peptide
injection did not induce significant changes in
blood insulin and glucagon levels (fig. S4),
suggesting that Klotho peptide inhibits insulin
action directly in peripheral tissues.

To test whether Klotho antagonizes insulin at
receptive cells, we determined whether re-

combinant Klotho peptide would reduce glucose
uptake by blocking insulin binding to the insulin
receptor. We measured cellular glucose uptake
in cultured myoblastic cells (L6) incubated with
or without insulin in the presence or absence of
100 pM of Klotho extracellular peptide. Klotho
peptide suppressed insulin-induced glucose
uptake by 55% without reducing the binding of
[125I] insulin to the cells (fig. S5). Thus, Klotho
does not appear to inhibit ligand-binding to the
insulin receptor, suggesting that Klotho may
block insulin action by disrupting one or more
alternative insulin-dependent intracellular sig-
naling pathways. Accordingly, we measured
the potential for [125I]-labeled Klotho to bind
directly to the cell surface. Hepatoma cells

bound [125I] Klotho in a dose-dependent
manner and saturated when the total Klotho
concentration exceeded 600 pM, and unlabeled
Klotho peptide inhibited the binding of [125I]
Klotho (fig. S6). Together, these observations
suggest that cells present a receptor at their
surface other than the insulin receptor that
binds to the Klotho peptide.

Klotho inhibits intracellular insulin
and IGF1 signaling. Because membrane-
bound Klotho peptide must inhibit ligand acti-
vation of the insulin receptor within the cells, we
investigated the influence of Klotho on insulin
receptor signal transduction (25, 26). We in-
cubated L6 cells or rat hepatoma cells (H4IIE)
with recombinant Klotho peptide and insulin
(10 nM) or IGF1 (10 nM). Klotho peptide did
not inhibit the binding of [125I] insulin or
[125I ] IGF1 (fig. S5) but suppressed ligand-
stimulated autophosphorylation of insulin
and IGF1 receptors in a dose-dependent man-
ner (Fig. 3, A and B). Additionally, Klotho
reduced activation of signaling events down-
stream of receptor activation, including tyrosine-
phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1
and 2,
the association of the subunit of
phosphoinositide 3–kinase p85 with IRS proteins
(Fig. 3, A and B). Because the inhibitory effect
of Klotho on insulin signaling was observed as
early as 1 min after insulin stimulation (Fig. 3C),
the decline in tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin
and IGF1 receptors is unlikely due simply to the
loss of receptors. Notably, Klotho peptide can
inactivate active insulin receptors that were
previously tyrosine phosphorylated by insulin
stimulation. In H4IIE cells that were exposed to
10 nM insulin before adding Klotho peptide,
Klotho suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of
the insulin receptor (Fig. 3D). We observed a
similar effect on IGF1 receptor autophospho-
rylation in L6 cells with IGF1 before adding
Klotho peptide (9). Importantly, the inhibitory
effect of Klotho on autophosphorylation of re-
ceptor tyrosine kinases is specific. We observed
no inhibitory effect of Klotho on the epidermal
growth factor receptor and the platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (fig. S7). Overall, Klotho
appears to inhibit activation of the insulin and
IGF1 receptor and to repress activated insulin
and IGF1 receptors. Whether Klotho peptide
functions by accelerating removal of tyrosine
phosphorylation from the activated insulin recep-
tor remains to be determined.

Inhibition of insulin and IGF1 signaling
rescues KLj/j phenotypes. If the ability of
Klotho to inhibit insulin and IGF1 signaling
extends survival by retarding senescence, in-
dependent manipulations to inhibit
insulin
and IGF1 signaling may ameliorate some of
the aging-like phenotypes in KLj/j mice.
Accordingly, we crossed a loss-of-function
mutation of IRS-1 into the KLj/j mice (27 ).
Survival was improved in KLj/j mice het-
erozygous for an IRS-1 null allele (KLj/j
IRS-1þ/j) relative to KLj/j control mice

(Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, KLj/j IRS-1þ/j
mice ameliorated many age-related patholo-
gies typical of KLj/j mice, including arterio-
sclerosis, ectopic calcification, skin atrophy,
pulmonary emphysema, and hypogonadism
(Fig. 4, C to N). Heterozygosity of IRS-1
alone (KLþ/þ IRS-1þ/j littermates) appears to
have no effect on survival and the age-
progressive degeneration when compared with
those factors in wild-type littermates during
these experiments (9).

Conclusion. We previously reported that a
defect in Klotho gene expression leads to a
syndrome that may resemble premature aging
(1). Here, we show that overexpression of
Klotho can extend life span, and we suggest
that Klotho functions as an aging suppressor
gene in mammals. We found that the extra-
cellular domain of Klotho protein circulates in
the blood and binds to a putative cell-surface
receptor. Klotho has marked effects on insulin
physiology, apparently because it suppresses
tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin and IGF1
receptors, which results in reduced activity of
IRS proteins and their association with PI3-
kinase,
thereby inhibiting insulin and IGF1
signaling. Extended life span upon negative
regulation of insulin and IGF1 signaling is an
evolutionarily conserved mechanism to sup-
press aging (28). Klotho appears to be a peptide

Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows have provided important clues to the nature
of these massive explosive events, providing direct information on the nearby
environment and indirect information on the central engine that powers the
burst. We report the discovery of two bright x-ray flares in GRB afterglows,
including a giant flare comparable in total energy to the burst itself, each peaking
minutes after the burst. These strong, rapid x-ray flares imply that the central
engines of the bursts have long periods of activity, with strong internal shocks
continuing for hundreds of seconds after the gamma-ray emission has ended.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most power-
ful explosions since the Big Bang, with typical
energies around 1051 ergs. Long GRBs (du-
2 s) are thought to signal the creation
ration

(1–4). The detected signals from the resulting
highly relativistic fireballs consist of prompt
gamma-ray emission (from internal shocks in
