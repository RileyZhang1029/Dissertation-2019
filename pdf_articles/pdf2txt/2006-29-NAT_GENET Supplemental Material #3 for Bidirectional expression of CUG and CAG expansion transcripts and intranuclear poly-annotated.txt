Supplementary Figure 3:  Ataxin 8 (ATXN8) open reading frame and 
flanking sequence.

Sequence analysis of three potential reading frames spanning the SCA8 repeat 
in CAG direction.  Amino acids are indicated by standard one-letter symbols, 
and asterisks indicate stop codons.  Only the polyglutamine-encoding reading 
frame (boxed on RNA sequence and shaded on amino acid sequence) has an 
AUG start codon between the last stop codon and the repeat tract.  This short 
ORF [M(Q)n] is immediately followed by successive stop codons.
