Type 2 Diabetes

Obesity contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes, but the
underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Using cell culture and mouse
models, we show that obesity causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This
stress in turn leads to suppression of insulin receptor signaling through
hyperactivation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and subsequent serine
phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate–1 (IRS-1). Mice deficient in X-
box–binding protein–1 (XBP-1), a transcription factor that modulates the ER
stress response, develop insulin resistance. These findings demonstrate that
ER stress is a central feature of peripheral
insulin resistance and type 2
diabetes at the molecular, cellular, and organismal
levels. Pharmacologic
manipulation of this pathway may offer novel opportunities for treating these
common diseases.

The cluster of pathologies known as meta-
bolic syndrome,
including obesity,
insulin
resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascu-
lar disease, has become one of the most
serious threats to human health. The dramat-
ic increase in the incidence of obesity in
most parts of the world has contributed to the
emergence of this disease cluster, particular-
ly insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
However, understanding the molecular me-
chanisms underlying these individual dis-
orders and their links with each other has
been challenging.
Over the past decade, it has become clear
that obesity is associated with the activation of
cellular stress signaling and inflammatory
pathways (1–4). However, the origin of this
stress is not known. A key player in the
cellular stress response is the ER, a membra-
nous network that functions in the synthesis
and processing of secretory and membrane
proteins. Certain pathological stress condi-
tions disrupt ER homeostasis and lead to
accumulation of unfolded or misfolded pro-
teins in the ER lumen (5–7). To cope with this
stress, cells activate a signal
transduction
system linking the ER lumen with the
cytoplasm and nucleus, called the unfolded
protein response (UPR) (5–7). Among the

conditions that trigger ER stress are glucose
or nutrient deprivation, viral
infections,
lipids, increased synthesis of secretory pro-
teins, and expression of mutant or misfolded
proteins (8–10).
Several of these conditions occur
in
obesity. Specifically, obesity increases the
demand on the synthetic machinery of the
cells in many secretory organ systems .
Obesity is also associated with mechanical
stress, excess lipid accumulation, abnormal-
ities in intracellular energy fluxes, and
nutrient availability. In light of these obser-
vations, we postulated that obesity may be a
chronic stimulus for ER stress in peripheral
tissues and that perhaps ER stress is a core
mechanism involved in triggering insulin
resistance and type 2 diabetes.

Induction of ER stress in obesity. To

examine whether ER stress is increased in
obes ity , we investigated the expression
patterns of several molecular indicators of
ER stress in dietary [high-fat diet (HFD)–
induced] and genetic (ob/ob) models of
murine obesity. The pancreatic ER kinase
o r PKR - l ike k inase (PERK )
is an ER
transmembrane protein kinase that phospho-
rylates the " subunit of translation initiation
factor 2 (eIF2") in response to ER stress.
The phosphorylation status of PERK and
eIF2" is therefore a key indicator of the
presence of ER stress (11–13). We deter-
mined the phosphorylation status of PERK
(Thr980) and eIF2" (Ser51) using phospho-
specific antibodies. These experiments dem-
o n s t r a t e d i n c r e a s e d PERK a n d e I F 2 "
phosphorylation in liver extracts of obese

mice compared with lean controls (Fig. 1, A
and B). The activity of c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) is also increased by ER stress
(14). Consistent with earlier observations
(3), total JNK activity, indicated by c-Jun
phosphorylation, was also dramatically ele-
vated in the obese mice (Fig. 1, A and B).
The 78-kD glucose-regulated/binding im-
munoglobulin protein (GRP78) is an ER
chaperone whose expression is increased
upon ER stress (7). The GRP78 mRNA
levels were elevated in the liver tissue of
obese mice compared with matched lean
controls (Fig. 1, C and D). Because GRP78
expression is responsive to glucose (15), we
tested whether
this up-regulation m ight
simply be due to increasing glucose levels.
Treatment of cultured rat Fao liver cells with
high levels of glucose resulted in reduced
GRP78 expression (fig. S1A). Similarly,
GRP78 levels were not increased in a mouse
model of hyperglycemia (fig. S1B), which
indicates that regulation in obesity is unlike-
ly to be related to glycemia alone.

meostasis, for indications of ER stress in
obesity. As in liver, PERK phosphorylation,
JNK activity, and GRP78 expression were all
significantly increased in adipose tissue of
obese animals compared with lean controls
(fig. S2, A to C). However, no indication for
ER stress was evident in the muscle tissue of
obese animals (16). Taken together,
these
results indicate that obesity is associated
with induction of ER stress predominantly
in liver and adipose tissues.

ER stress inhibits insulin action in liver

cells. To investigate whether ER stress
interferes with insulin action, we pretreated
Fao liver cells with tunicamycin or thapsi-
gargin, agents commonly used to induce ER
stress. Tunicamycin significantly decreased
insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation

of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) (Fig. 2,
A and B), and it also produced an increase in
the molecular weight of IRS-1 (Fig. 2A). IRS-
1 is a substrate for insulin receptor tyrosine
kinase, and serine phosphorylation of IRS-1,
particularly mediated by JNK, reduces insulin
receptor signaling (3). Pretreatment of Fao
cells with tunicamycin produced a significant
increase in serine phosphorylation of IRS-1
(Fig. 2, A and B). Tunicamycin pretreatment
also suppressed insulin-induced Akt phos-
phorylation, a more distal event in the insulin
receptor signaling pathway (Fig. 2, A and B).
Similar
results were also obtained after
treatment with thapsigargin (fig. S3A), which
was independent of alterations in cellular
calcium levels (fig. S3B). Hence, experimen-
tal ER stress inhibits insulin action.

We next examined the role of JNK in ER
stress–induced IRS-1 serine phosphorylation
and inhibition of insulin-stimulated IRS-1
tyrosine phosphorylation. Inhibition of JNK
a c t i v i t y w i t h t h e s y n t h e t i c i n h i b i t o r ,
SP600125 (17), reversed the ER stress–
induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1
(Fig. 2, C and D). Pretreatment of Fao cells
with a highly specific inhibitory peptide
derived from the JNK-binding protein, JIP
(18), also completely preserved insulin re-
ceptor signaling in cells exposed to tunicamy-
cin (Fig. 2, E and F). Similar results were
obtained with the synthetic JNK inhibitor,
SP600125 (16). These results indicate that ER
stress promotes a JNK-dependent serine phos-
phorylation of IRS-1, which in turn inhibits
insulin receptor signaling.

Inositol-requiring kinase–1! (IRE-1!)
plays a crucial role in insulin receptor

signaling. In the presence of ER stress,
increased phosphorylation of IRE-1" leads
to recruitment of
tumor necrosis factor
receptor–associated factor 2 (TRAF2) pro-
tein and activation of JNK (14). To address
whether ER stress–induced insulin resistance
is dependent on intact IRE-1", we measured
JNK activation, IRS-1 serine phosphoryla-
tion, and insulin receptor signaling after
exposure of IRE-1"j/j and wild-type fibro-
blasts to tunicamycin. In the wild-type, but

not IRE-1"j/j cells, induction of ER stress
by tunicamycin resulted in strong activation
of JNK (Fig. 2G). Tunicamycin also stimu-
lated phosphorylation of IRS-1 at the Ser307
residue in wild-type, but not IRE-1"j/j,
fibroblasts (Fig. 2G). It is noteworthy that
tun icamyc in inh ib i ted insu l in-s t imu la ted
tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the
wild-type cells, whereas no such effect was
detected in the IRE-1"j/j cells (Fig. 2H).
The level of insulin-induced tyrosine phos-
pho ry la t ion o f
IRS-1 was d rama t ica l ly
higher in IRE-1"j/j cells, despite lower

total IRS-1 protein levels (Fig. 2H). These
results demonstrate that ER stress–induced
inhibition of insulin action is mediated by an
IRE-1"– and JNK–dependent protein kinase
cascade.

Manipulation of X-box–binding protein–
1 (XBP-1) levels alters insulin receptor

signaling. The transcription factor XBP-1 is
a bZIP protein. The spliced or processed
form of XBP-1 (XBP-1s) is a key factor in
ER stress through transcriptional regulation
of an array of genes, including molecular
chaperones (19–22). We therefore reasoned
that modulation of XBP-1s levels in cells
should alter insulin action via its potential
impact on the magnitude of the ER stress
responses. To test this possibility, we estab-
lished XBP-1 gain- and loss-of-function
cellular models. First, we established an
inducible gene expression system where
exogenous XBP-1s is expressed only in the
absence of tetracycline/doxycycline (Fig.
3A). In parallel, we also studied mouse
embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from
XBP-1j/j mice (Fig. 3B). In fibroblasts
without exogenous XBP-1s expression, tuni-
camycin treatment (2 6g/ml) resulted in
PERK phosphorylation starting at 30 min
and peaking at 3 to 4 hours, associated with a
mobility shift characteristic of PERK phos-
phorylation (Fig. 3C). In these cells, there
was also a rapid and robust activation of
JNK in response to ER stress (Fig. 3C).
When XBP-1s expression was induced, there
was a dramatic reduction in both PERK
phosphorylation and JNK activation after
tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 3C). Hence,
overexpression of XBP-1s rendered wild-
type cells refractory to ER stress. Similar
experiments performed in XBP-1j/j MEFs
revealed an opposite pattern (Fig. 3D).
XBP-1j/j MEFs mounted strong ER stress
responses even when treated with a low
dose of
tunicamycin (0.5 6g/ml), which
failed to stimulate significant ER stress in
wild-type cells (Fig. 3D). Under these con-
ditions, PERK phosphorylation and JNK
activation levels in XBP-1j/j MEFs were
significantly higher than those seen in wild-
type controls (Fig. 3D), which indicates that
XBP-1j/j cells are prone to ER stress. Thus,
alterations in the levels of cellular XBP-1s
protein result in alterations in the ER stress
responses.
Next, we examined whether these differ-
ences in the ER stress responses produced
alterations in insulin action as assessed by
IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and insulin-
stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation.
Tunicamycin-induced IRS-1 serine phospho-
rylation was significantly reduced in fibro-
b las ts exogenous ly express ing XBP -1s ,
compared with that of control cells (Fig. 3E).
On insulin stimulation, the extent of IRS-1
tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly

IRS-1 serine phosphorylation was strongly
induced in XBP-1j/j MEFs compared with
XBP-1þ/þ controls even at
low doses of
tunicamycin treatment (0.5 6g/ml) (Fig. 3G).
After insulin stimulation,
the amount of
IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was signif-
icantly decreased in tunicamycin-treated
XBP-1j/j cells compared with tunicamycin-
treated wild-type controls (Fig. 3H). Insulin-
stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the
insulin receptor was normal in these cells
(fig. S4).

XBP-1+/-- mice show impaired glucose

homeostasis. Complete XBP-1 deficiency
resu l ts in embryon ic le tha l i ty (23) . To
investigate the role of XBP-1 in ER stress,
insulin sensitivity, and systemic glucose
metabolism in vivo, we studied BALB/c-
XBP-1þ/j mice with a null mutation in
one XBP-1 allele. We chose mice on the
BALB/c genetic background, because this
strain exhibits strong resistance to obesity-
induced alterations in systemic glucose
metabolism. Based on our results with cel-
lular systems, we hypothesized that XBP-1
deficiency would predispose mice to the
development of insulin resistance and type
2 diabetes.
We fed XBP-1þ/j mice and their wild-
type littermates a HFD at 3 weeks of age. In
parallel, control mice of both genotypes
were placed on laboratory feed, a regular
diet. The total body weights of both geno-
types were similar with regular diet and until
12 weeks of age when fed HFD. After this
the XBP-1þ/jan ima ls fed HFD
per iod ,
exhibited a small, but significant, increase

in body weight (Fig. 4A). Serum levels of
leptin, adiponectin, and triglycerides did not
exhibit any statistically significant differ-
ences between the genotypes measured after
16 weeks of HFD (fig. S5).
Fed HFD, XBP-1þ/j mice developed
continuous and progressive hyperinsulinemia
evident as early as 4 weeks (Fig. 4B). Insulin
levels continued to increase in XBP-1þ/j
mice for the duration of the experiment.
Blood insulin levels in XBP-1þ/þ mice were
significantly lower than those in XBP-1þ/j
littermates (Fig. 4B). C-peptide levels were
also significantly higher in XBP-1þ/j ani-
mals than in wild-type controls (Fig. 4C).
Blood glucose levels also began to rise in
the XBP-1þ/j mice fed HFD starting at
8 weeks and remained high until the con-
clusion of the experiment at 20 weeks (Fig.
4D). This pattern was the same in both fasted
(Fig. 4D) and fed (16) states. The rise in
blood glucose in the face of hyperinsuline-
mia in the mice fed HFD is a strong indicator
of the development of peripheral
insulin
resistance.
To investigate systemic insulin sensitiv-
ity, we performed glucose tolerance tests
(GTT) and insulin tolerance tests (ITT) in
XBP-1þ/j mice and XBP-1þ/þ controls.
Exposure to HFD resulted in significant
g lucose in to lerance in XBP-1þ/j m ice .
After 7 weeks of HFD, XBP-1þ/j mice
showed significantly higher glucose levels
on glucose challenge than XBP-1þ/þ mice
(Fig. 4E). This glucose intolerance contin-
in XBP - 1þ/j m i c e
u e d to be ev id en t
compared with wild-type mice after 16
weeks of HFD (Fig. 4F). During ITT, the
hypoglycemic response to insulin was also

significantly lower in XBP-1þ/j mice com-
pared with XBP-1þ/þ littermates at 8 weeks
of HFD (Fig. 4G), and this reduced respon-
siveness continued to be evident after 17
weeks of HFD (Fig. 4H). Examination of
islets morphology and function did not re-
veal significant differences between geno-
types (fig. S6). Hence, loss of an XBP-1
allele pred isposes m ice to d ie t- induced
peripheral
insulin resistance and type 2
diabetes.

Increased ER stress and impa ired
insulin signaling in XBP-1+/-- mice. Our

experiments with cultured cells demon-
strated an increase in ER stress and a
decrease in insulin signaling capacity in
XBP-1–deficient cells, as well as reversal of
these phenotypes on expression of high
levels of XBP-1s. If this mechanism is the
basis of the insulin resistance seen in XBP-
1þ/j mice, these animals should exhibit high
levels of ER stress coupled with impaired
insulin receptor signaling. To test this, we
first examined PERK phosphorylation and
JNK activity in the livers of obese XBP-1þ/j
and wild-type mice . These experiments
revealed an increase in PERK levels and
seemingly an increase in liver PERK phos-
phorylation in obese XBP-1þ/j mice com-
pared with wild-type controls fed HFD
(Fig. 5A). There was a significant increase
in JNK activity in XBP-1þ/j mice com-
pared with wild-type controls (Fig. 5B).
Consistent with these results, Ser307 phos-
phorylation of IRS-1 was also increased in
XBP-1þ/j mice compared with wild-type
controls fed HFD (Fig. 5C). Finally, we
studied in vivo insulin-stimulated,
insulin
receptor–signaling capacity in these mice.

There was no detectable difference in any of
the insulin receptor–signaling components
in liver and adipose tissues between geno-
types taking regular diet (fig. S7). However,
after exposure to HFD, major components
of insulin receptor signaling in the liver,
including insulin-stimulated insulin recep-
tor, IRS-1, and IRS-2 tyrosine- and Akt
serine-phosphorylation, were all decreased
in XBP-1þ/j mice compared with wild-type
con t ro l s
(F ig . 5 , D to G ) . A s im i la r
suppression of insulin receptor signaling
was also evident in the adipose tissues of
XBP-1þ/j mice compared with XBP-1þ/þ
mice fed HFD (fig. S8). The suppression of
IR tyrosine phosphorylation in XBP-1þ/j
mice differs from the observations made in
XBP-1j/j cells, where ER stress inhibited
insulin action after the receptor signal
in
the pathway. It is likely that this difference
reflects the effects of chronic hyperinsuline-
mia in vivo on insulin receptors. Hence, our
data demonstrate the link between ER stress
and insulin action in vivo but are not
conclusive in determining the exact
locus
in insulin receptor signaling pathway that is
targeted through this mechanism.
Discussion. In this study, we identify
ER stress as a molecular
link between
obesity, the deterioration of insulin action,
and the development of type 2 diabetes. In-
duction of ER stress or reduction in the com-
pensatory capacity through down-regulation
of XBP-1 leads to suppression of insulin
receptor signaling in intact cells via IRE-1"–
dependent activation of JNK. Experiments
with mouse models also yielded data consist-
ent with the link between ER stress and
systemic insulin action. Deletion of an XBP-1

allele in mice leads to enhanced ER stress,
hyperactivation of JNK,
reduced insulin
receptor signaling, systemic insulin resist-
ance, and type 2 diabetes.
Our
findings point
to a fundamental
mechanism underlying the molecular sensing
of obesity-induced metabolic stress by the
ER and inhibition of insulin action that
ultimately leads to insulin resistance and
type 2 diabetes. We therefore postulate that
ER stress underlies the emergence of the
stress and inflammatory responses in obesity
and the integrated deterioration of systemic
glucose homeostasis.
Although our results in this study pre-
dominantly point to a role for ER stress in
peripheral insulin resistance, earlier studies
have linked ER stress with islet function
and survival. For example, PERKj/j mice
exhib i t a phenotype resembling type 1
d iabe tes resu l t ing f rom pancreat ic is le t
destruction soon after birth (24). PERK
mutations also cause a rare inherited form
of type 1 diabetes in humans (25). Loss of
eIF2" phosphorylation by targeted mutation
of serine 51 residue of eIF2" to alanine also
leads to alterations in pancreatic beta cell
function, in addition to its impact on liver
gluconeogenesis (11, 26). Therefore, we
propose that
the effect of chronic ER
stress on glucose homeostasis in obesity
could represent a central and integrating
me chan i sm unde r ly ing bo th pe r iphe ra l
insu l in resis tance and impa ired insu l in
secretion.
The critical role of ER stress responses in
insulin action may represent a mechanism
conserved by evolution , whereby stress
signals are integrated with metabolic regula-

R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E

tory pathways through the ER. This integra-
tion could have been advantageous, because
proper regulation of energy fluxes and the
suppression of major anabolic pathways
might have been favorable during acute
s tress , pa thogen invas ion , and immune
responses. Hence, the trait would propagate
through natural selection. However, in the
presence of chronic ER stress, such as we see
in obes ity ,
the e ffec t of ER stress on
metabolic regulation would lead to the
development of insulin resistance and, even-
tually, type 2 diabetes. In terms of therapeu-
tics, our findings suggest that interventions
that regulate the ER stress response offer
new opportunities for preventing and treating
type 2 diabetes.
