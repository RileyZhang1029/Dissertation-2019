fauna of Hong Kong: species survival in a highly degraded landscape.  Zoological Studies 49(2): 253-264.  
We spent 3 yr (2000-2003) surveying the status of larger mammals (> 0.5 kg) in the highly fragmented and 
degraded landscape of Hong Kong using 373 camera-trap sites distributed in 43 terrestrial wildlife habitat 
patches.  In total, 20 mammal species were recorded including 15 larger mammals.  The Malayan porcupine 
(Hystrix brachyura) and red muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) were apparently the most abundant species, while 
the crab-eating mongoose (Herpestes urva), Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla), small Indian mongoose 
(Herpestes javanicus), and yellow-bellied weasel (Mustela kathiah) were the least abundant.  The red muntjac, 
small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), and Malayan porcupine had the widest distributions, while the Chinese 
pangolin, small Indian mongoose, and yellow-bellied weasel were most restricted.  Many species were absent 
from Lantau I., despite its relatively large size (144 km2) and lower current human disturbance, suggesting 
pas t ex t i rpa t ions .  The key managemen t need fo r la rge r mamma ls in Hong Kong is the p ro tec t ion and 
enhancement of habitat links between adjacent protected areas, especially the cross-border corridor between 
the National Forest Park in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province and the Country Park system in Hong Kong.

t h e a b o v e s t u d i e s .  I n m a n y w a y s , i t c a n b e 
considered a “worst case scenario” for the survival 
of mammalian diversity.  Seven million people are 
crammed into a land area of 1100 km2 that has 
a lready seen at least 7000 years of cont inuous 
human occupation (Dudgeon and Corlett 2004).  
A l l bu t the mos t rugged topog raphy has been 
cu lt ivated at some t ime in the last few hundred 
years and there is evidence for massive loss of 
top so i l f rom the s teepe r s lopes .  As a resu l t , 
a l though Hong Kong ha s a fo re s t c l ima te , no 
substantial remnants of the original forest cover 
h a v e s u r v i v e d , a n d t h e m o s t e x t e n s i v e p l a n t 
communities today are fire-maintained grasslands, 
successional shrublands, secondary forests, and 
exotic plantation monocultures.
Despite this long history of massive human 
impac ts , su rveys ove r the las t 20 y r show tha t 
Hong Kong still supports a surprising diversity of 
p lant and an ima l spec ies (Dudgeon and Cor lett 
2004 ) .  The d ive rs i ty ho tspo ts o f d i ffe ren t taxa 
do no t , in gene ra l , co inc ide (Yip e t a l . 2004 ) , 
suggesting that different groups have been affected 
in d i ffe ren t ways by human ac t iv i t ies .  Seve ra l 
gene ra l fac to rs seem to have been impo r tan t ; 
however, in permitting the survival of wild species.  
One ma jo r fac to r is Hong Kong ’s ve ry rugged 
topography, wh ich has not on ly conf ined recent 
u rban deve lopmen t to < 30% o f the to ta l land 
area, but has also protected scattered pockets of 
woody vegetation from fire and cutting.  Another 
factor has been the local tradition of preserving or 
planting small forest patches (mostly < 4 ha) near 
v i l lages for reasons of feng shu i, the trad it iona l 
Chinese theory for determining the most favorable 
loca t ion fo r se t t lemen ts in o rde r to b r ing good 
fo r tune (Yu 1992 , Dudgeon and Co r le t t 2004 ) .  
Both oral traditions and the floristic composition 
suggest that some of these feng shui forests are 
several hundred years old, and it is possible that 
some began as preserved fragments of the original 
forest cover of the region.  However, while feng 
shui theory protects the vegetation, it gives only 
indirect protection to the fauna of these forests.  A 
3rd factor is the re laxat ion of human impacts in 
upland areas over the last 50 yr.  The declining 
rural population, the progressive abandonment of 
agriculture, and the active prevention and control 
of hill fires have resulted in a great expansion of 
woody vegetation, so that secondary shrublands 
and forests now cover more than a 1/3 of the total 
land area (Dudgeon and Corlett 2004).  There has 
also been a big decline in the hunting and trapping 
of vertebrates over the last 20 yr.

Most of the well-surveyed taxonomic groups 
in Hong Kong are those that are known to survive 
re lat ive ly we l l in sma l l forest fragments (p lants, 
amph ib ians, repti les, rodents, and many groups 
of invertebrates) and/or are potentially capable of 
reinvading when human impacts are relaxed (birds, 
bats, and butterflies) (Corlett 2000).  By contrast, 
the s tud y repo r ted he re i s the 1 s t s y s tema t i c 
su r ve y o f the la rge r non - f l y ing mamma l s : the 
taxonomic group that is most sensitive to habitat 
fragmentat ion and hunt ing, and for wh ich many 
spec ies have d i ff icu l ty c ross ing la rge a reas o f 
unsuitable habitat.  Checklists have been compiled 
from casual sightings and a small amount of live-
trapping data, but the distribution, abundance, and 
conservation status of most recorded taxa were 
largely unknown when this study was initiated in 
2000 (Shek 2006).  The primary aim of this study 
was to fill in these gaps, by assessing the current 
status of the larger mammal fauna (body mass > 
0.5 kg) of Hong Kong.  Mammalian nomenclature 
follows Smith and Xie (2008).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
(SAR) of the People’s Republic of China (hereafter 
Hong Kong ) encompasses a b iogeog raph ica l ly 
arb i trary 1 ,100 km2 sec t ion o f coas ta l sou thern 
China, along with adjacent islands (Fig. 1).  Hong 
Kong has a subtropical monsoon climate, with hot, 
wet summers and cool, dry winters (Dudgeon and 
Co r le t t 2004 ) .  The mean mon th ly tempe ra tu re 
near sea level varies from 15.8°C in Jan. to 28.8°C 
in July, and the mean annual rainfall ranges from 
1,300 mm at the driest site to > 3,000 mm on the 
h ighest peaks.  The geo logy is large ly igneous, 
a n d t h e t o p o g r a p h y i s v e r y r u g g e d , w i t h t h e 
highest point 957 m above sea level.  Natural open 
habitats in the Hong Kong region must have been 
ra re , w i th coas ta l c l i ffs , beaches , and pe rhaps 
seasona l ly f looded r iver ine grass lands the on ly 
ones ex tens ive enough to suppor t a non- fores t 
flora and fauna.
A l though ea r l y human se t t lemen t s in the 
region must have had some impacts on the biota, 
the major period of deforestation seems to have 
begun fo l low ing increased Ch inese imm igra t ion 
in the 11th and 12th centuries (Marks 1998).  The 
process accelerated with population increases in 
the 16th and 17th centuries, and was essentially 
completed by the end of the 18th century.  There 
are no descriptions of Hong Kong itself before the

mid-18th century, but earlier European visitors to 
the Pearl River delta region, west of Hong Kong, 
make no mention of forests (Dudgeon and Corlett 
2004).  Even the highest slopes were terraced for 
tea by the late 17th century, and probably earlier, 
and it is hard to see where any substantial area 
of forest could have survived in Hong Kong past 
that time.  The total forest cover probably reached 
a low point in the 19th century and again in 1945, 
when < 4% of Hong Kong ’s tota l land area was 
forested, all in scattered patches of at most a few 
hectares in extent.  Since then, the forest area has 
gradually increased, by both planting and natural 
succession, to around 17% of Hong Kong’s total 
land area, with another 20% covered in secondary 
shrub land (Dudgeon and Cor le t t 2004) .  Fores t 
success ion has been mos t rap id on the lowe r 
slopes of hills, while the lowlands are increasingly 
urbanized, and the upper slopes are still largely 
covered in fire-maintained grasslands.
Modern Hong Kong exhibits a sharp contrast

density suburbs.  Urban areas are therefore not 
a s ign i f ican t hab i ta t fo r w i ld mamma ls , excep t 
commensal species, and were excluded from this 
survey.  Major habitats for terrestrial mammals in 
Hong Kong today include a variety of open habitats 
(cultivated areas, grasslands, shrubby grasslands, 
and shrublands) and forest types (lowland forests, 
m o n t a n e f o r e s t s , p l a n t a t i o n s , a n d f e n g s h u i 
forests).  For this study, terrestrial habitats were 
delineated based on a land-use map generated by 
the Lands Department of the Hong Kong SAR with 
sub-me ter accuracy.  Terres tr ia l land-use types 
were aggregated into 43 terrestrial wildlife habitat 
(TWH ) pa tches , based on the i r con t igu i ty (F ig . 
1).  The total coverage of the TWH patches was 
593.7 km2, which is about 54% of the total area of 
the entire Hong Kong SAR.  Patches vary in size, 
shape, and degree of connectivity.  Seventeen of 
the larger patches were surveyed, with a total area 
of 529.9 km2, which is approximately 89% of the 
existing wildlife habitat in Hong Kong (Fig. 1).

sensor that is triggered by moving objects with a 
temperature different from the ambient air.  These 
came ras we re used to conduc t th i s su rvey o f 
larger mammals in Hong Kong from Sept. 2000 to 
Dec. 2003.  In total, 373 camera sites were set up 
during the study period, selected to cover different 
wildlife habitats in Hong Kong (Fig. 2).  To collect 
information more effectively, camera traps were set 
up at locations where there were animal trails or 
tracks.  The number of camera sites in each TWH 
pa tch ranged from 3 to 45 (X = 21 .9 ; s tandard 
deviation (SD) = 12.5) depending on the size and 
the degree of habitat heterogeneity.  Cameras were 
installed 1.5-2.5 m above the ground overlooking a 
trail and were angled downwards at 25°-45°, since 
prior experience had shown that this arrangement 
is effective in detecting mammals over the full size 
range present in Hong Kong.  Film collection and 
battery replacement was conducted every 2-4 wk.

to assess the s ta tus o f te r res t r ia l w i ld l i fe .  Fo r 
ind iv idua l ly iden t i f iab le spec ies , came ra - t raps 
can be used to estimate population densities by 
capture-resight (Karanth et al. 2004, Marnewick et 
al. 2008).  Since estimates from the mark-recapture 
method and the total number identified are strongly 
correlated, photographic rates (i.e., the number of 
camera days per animal photographed) are used 
to assess cryptic mammal densities (Carbone et 
al. 2001, O’Brien et al. 2003).  However, density 
e s t im a t e s f r om p h o t o g r a p h i c r a t e s s h o u l d b e 
used with caution, since independent estimates of 
animal densities at representative sites are needed 
for calibration and to evaluate the precision of the 
ca l ibrat ion (Carbone et a l. 2002, Jenne l le et a l. 
2002).
In th is s tudy, the occu r rence index (O I =

working hours) was used to represent the relative

considered a single picture-event to prevent the 
overrepresen ta t ion o f a l inger ing ind iv idua l .  In 
gene ra l , the h ighe r the dens i ty o f a spec ies in 
the area, the more pictures that will be taken, but 
compa r isons be tween spec ies mus t be t rea ted 
with caution because of differences in size, life-
form, and behavioral patterns.  Since the functional 
re lat ionsh ip between the index and dens ity was 
not ca l ibrated, the OI was not used to est imate 
populations but to indicate the relative abundance 
distributions between TWHs for each species.  For 
each species, the patch OI value was calculated 
as the average of all camera sites in the patch, 
and the overall OI value was the average of the 
patch OIs.  The patch OIs for each species were 
c lass i f ied in to 5 leve ls fo r mapp ing , based on 
their deviation from the overall OI for that species: 
medium (within the range of overall OI ± 0.5 SD), 
low (less than the overall OI - 0.5 SD), moderately 
high (between the overall OI + 0.5 and 1.5 SD), 
high (between the overall OI + 1.5 and 2.5 SD), 
and very high (greater than the overall OI + 2.5 
SD).  Trap-site occupancy was calculated as the 
percentage of camera sites at which a species was 
recorded.

ranged 8,097-147,110 (X = 84,858, SD = 44,549) h.  
Twenty mammalian species were recorded during 
the survey period, including 15 larger mammalian 
s p e c i e s a n d P a l l a s’s s q u i r r e l ( C a l l o s c i u r u s

was 9,215 (Table 1).  The other 4 species were 
murid rodents and shrews, which could not always 
be distinguished in the photographs and are not 
considered further.
On the basis of the overall OI, the Malayan 
porcup ine (Hys tr ix brachyura) (O I = 1 .304) and 
red mun t jac (Mun t iacus mun t jak ) (O I = 1 .006 ) 
were the species most often photographed, while 
the crab-eat ing mongoose (Herpestes urva) (OI

9 spec ies – the leopard ca t , sma l l Ind ian c ive t , 
masked palm civet, Chinese ferret badger, crab-
ea t ing mongoose , Ma layan porcup ine , Ch inese 
pangolin, red muntjac, and wild boar – are probably 
survivors of Hong Kong’s primeval mammal fauna.  
However, the wild boar populations may be mixed 
with feral domestic pigs.

this explanation is generally true, then significant

regions would be expected for other species that

introductions that began around 1915 (Dudgeon 
and Cor lett 2004).  Pa l las ’s tree squ irre l is a lso

but popu lat ions in Hong Kong were estab l ished 
from escaped or released individuals of 2 exotic 
subspec ies less than 40 y r ago (Dudgeon and 
Corlett 2004).

suggests it has recently colonized or re-colonized 
Hong Kong .  The c rab -ea t ing mongoose has a 
similar current distribution as the weasel.  Although 
th is spec ies was p resen t in Hong Kong in the 
past, it was believed to have been extinct by the 
1950s (Marsha l l 1967 , H i l l and Ph i l l ipps 1981) , 
and it is possible (but not provable) that the current 

popu la t ion is a resu l t o f re -co lon iza t ion by the 
same rou te as the ye l low -be l l ied wease l .  The 
small Indian mongoose was first definitely recorded 
in Hong Kong in the 1980s and is now abundant 
in the Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve (outside 
our survey area) and widespread throughout the 
central and northern New Territories (Dudgeon and 
Corlett 2004).  It is a conspicuous diurnal animal

introduction.
Fera l cats, dogs, and catt le are apparent ly 
also recent additions to Hong Kong’s mammalian 
fauna, with feral cattle, in particular, only becoming 
established within the last 2 decades following their 
abandonmen t as fa rm ing became uneconom ic

are now the most widespread carnivore species 
in Hong Kong, but feral cats have a much more 
restricted distribution, being widespread only on 
Lantau I., where the ecologically similar leopard 
cat is absent.

casual sightings, it is unlikely that any other large 
mammal species survive in inland habitats in Hong 
Kong.  Four carnivore species reliably recorded in 
the last century, tiger, leopard, large Indian civet, 
and red fox, are undoubtedly extinct.  Excluding 
these extinct species, the addition of the squirrel, 
p lus 8 spec ies o f mur id roden ts ( inc lud ing 5 or 
6 commensa ls) and 2 spec ies of shrew (Chung 
and Corlett 2006), gives a total current non-volant 
terrestrial mammal fauna of 26 species.  A 27th 
species, the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) occurs in 
very small numbers in the coastal Mai Po Marshes 
Nature Reserve in northwestern Hong Kong (Shek 
2006 ) .  In add i t ion , 26 ba t spec ies have been 
recorded in Hong Kong (Shek and Chan 2006), to 
give a total of 53 terrestrial mammal species.
I t is a lmos t ce r ta in tha t o the r mamma l ian 
spe c ie s be came e x t in c t in Hong Kong be fo re 
local records began, including flying squirrels and 
add i t iona l spec ies o f pr ima tes , carn ivores , and 
terrestrial herbivores (Corlett 2006), although there 
is no direct evidence for most of these taxa.  The 
known and inferred extinctions were mostly either 
a danger to people, their livestock, or their crops 
(tigers, leopards, dholes, bears, and elephants), 
h igh ly va lued in trad it iona l med ic ine (t igers and 
rhinoceroses), preferred prey of hunters (primates, 
large deer, and civets), and/or highly dependent 
on fo res t (p r ima tes , f ly ing squ i r re ls , and o the r 
forest rodents).  The survivors have few things in 
common, but they are all relatively small and all 
capable of utilizing non-forest habitats at least to 
some extent.

The spatial distribution of larger mammals in 
Hong Kong

The most striking feature of the geographical 
distribution of larger mammals in Hong Kong is the 
absence of many species from Lantau I., despite 
i ts re la t ive l y la rge s ize (144 km 2) and rugged 
topography that has conf ined deve lopment to a 
narrow coastal strip.  The absence of macaques 
and tree squirrels probably reflects the absence 
of deliberate introductions, while the absence of 
the sma l l Ind ian mongoose and ye l low -be l l ied 
weasel is also not surprising if they have colonized 
Hong Kong only recently.  However, Lantau also 
has ne i the r c ive t spec ies , no r leopa rd ca ts o r 
po r cup ines , a l l o f wh ich o ccu r on the sma l le r  
(78 km2) and more-developed Hong Kong I.  It is 
possible that some of these species were never 
present on Lantau I., but it seems more likely that 
they we re ex t i rpa ted and have been unab le to 

recolonize across the marine barrier, although this 
does not exp la in the ir surv iva l on Hong Kong I.  
Indeed, porcupines have been recorded on several 
islands of < 2 km2 in area (Reels 1996).  Within 
the mainland New Territories, which supports all of 
the recorded mammal species, most species are 
widespread, except for those that are likely to be 
recent invasions or introductions.
One in te res t ing obse rva t ion is tha t nea r ly 
1/2 of the existing larger mammals in Hong Kong 
are typically forest edge and open-area species 
e lsewhe re (Tab le 2 ) , wh ich was no t expe c ted 
f o r s u c h a h i g h l y u r b a n i z e d a r e a w h e r e c i t y 
boundar ies are usua l ly immed iate ly ad jacent to 
forest edges.  A recent study at Kenting National 
Park (22°N, 121°E), Taiwan, at a similar latitude, 
found the oppos ite: desp ite h igh w i ld l ife hab itat 
cove rage (80% fo res t and 13% open hab i ta ts ; 
Chen and Chung 2003), 80% (4/5) of forest-edge 
and open -a rea spec ies , inc lud ing the Ch inese 
pangolin, small Indian civet (Francis 2008, Chen et 
al. 2009), leopard cat, and the sika deer (Cervus 
n ippon ta iouanus), became loca l ly ext inct when 
intensive human development near forest edges 
occurred during the past century (Pei 2004).  As 
mentioned earlier, both spontaneous and managed 
reforestation has been much faster in the foothills 
than in higher elevations in Hong Kong, and these 
foo th i l l fo res ts may have bu f fe red these edge 
species.  An analysis of landscape elements would 
be helpful to test this hypothesis.

Implications for conservation

Among native mammals, both civet species, 
the fe r re t badge r, red mun t jac , w i ld boa r, and 
Malayan porcupine are widespread and abundant 
in e x i s t ing p ro te c ted a rea s , and thu s o f lea s t 
current conservation concern.  The only obvious 
threat would be from fragmentation of the existing 
popu la t ions i f fu tu re de ve lopmen t o f the road 
sys tem severed ex is t ing l inks be tween Coun try 
Parks.  Currently, the only barrier between adjacent 
Country Parks is typically a secondary road that is 
relatively quiet at night.  Regular sightings and road 
kills show that the surviving large mammal species 
cross such roads, but widening or increased traffic 
could change this.
The leopard cat is widespread but apparently 
l e s s a b u n d a n t t h a n t h e p r e c e d i n g s p e c i e s .  
Additional research is needed to determine if the 
Hong Kong populations are viable, particularly that 
on Hong Kong I.  Although the Chinese pangolin 
is w idesp read , on ly 31 p ic tu res we re taken in

t o t a l .  I f t h i s i s a n a c c u r a t e i n d i c a t i o n o f t h e 
abundance of this species, then the pangolin will 
need active conservation support, and population 
recovery measures should be considered.  Natural 
dispersal into adjacent Country Parks is possible 
f o r t h e p a n g o l i n o n c e t h e p o p u l a t i o n d e n s i t y 
increases; however, to encourage the movement, 
a c t i v e m i c r o h a b i t a t m a n a g em e n t s h o u l d a l s o 
be undertaken in surrounding areas.  There are 
no recent records of th is spec ies be ing trapped 
o r h u n t e d i n H o n g K o n g , b u t g i v e n i t s h i g h 
commercial value this remains a potential threat.
The crab-eating mongoose and yellow-bellied 
weasel have similar restricted distributions in the 
northeastern New Territories.  The low numbers of 
both species suggest that, like the pangolin, they 
will need active conservation support to survive, 
inc lud ing poss ib le re in fo rcemen t by add i t iona l 
i n d i v i d u a l s f r om t h e n e a r e s t w i l d p o p u l a t i o n 
north of the Hong Kong border.  The small Indian 
mongoose was a lso rare ly photographed in th is 
su rvey, bu t i t favo rs non - fo res ted hab i ta ts tha t 
were not intensively surveyed, so its abundance 
was certainly underestimated.  Native or not, this 
species is currently of no conservation concern.
The popu la t ion o f rhesus macaques (and 
hybrids with released exotic long-tailed macaques, 
Macaca fascicularis) is currently expanding at a 
ra te > 5% per year and was expec ted to reach 
2 ,000 ind iv idua ls by the yea r 2007 (Wong and 
Chow 2004) .  Aggress ive encoun ters w i th park 
visitors continue to be a problem, despite a ban on 
feeding implemented in 1999, but this species is 
clearly of no conservation concern.
The remaining 3 large mammal species are 
feral populations of domesticated animals.  Packs 
of feral dogs are present throughout the protected 
area sys tem , apparen t ly as se l f-sus ta in ing w i ld 
populations, although they intergrade with urban 
strays (Dudgeon and Cor lett 2004).  In add it ion 
t o c o n s um i n g w a s t e h um a n f o o d , b o t h f i e l d 
observations and photographic evidence show that 
they kill civets, muntjacs, and porcupines, making 
them the top mammalian carnivore in Hong Kong.  
In view of the expense and difficulty of effective 
dog control, research is urgently needed to assess 
the severity of their impacts on prey populations.  
Fe ra l ca ts a re less abundan t and some o f the 
p ic tu res in th is su rvey may be o f w ide - rang ing 
domestic cats.  Most are relatively small animals, 
and their wild prey is likely to consist only of small 
vertebrates, such as rats, mice, shrews, and birds.  
However, their possible conflicts with the leopard 
cat popu lat ion shou ld not be over looked.  Fera l 

ca t t le a re the la rges t w i ld mamma ls in mode rn 
Hong Kong.  Their numbers have increased rapidly 
over the last decade as a result of breeding, rather 
than additional releases, and they are spreading 
into previously unoccupied areas.  Their impacts 
o n t h e v e g e t a t i o n o f o p e n a r e a s a n d f o r e s t 
understory are obvious, both by trampling and by 
selective grazing and browsing, and they appear to 
facilitate the invasion of exotic plant species (Leung 
et al. 2009).  Again, further research is needed into 
both their current impacts and  possible means of 
control.

exper imenta l re introduct ion of m iss ing taxa into

missing carnivores, the leopard cat is an obvious 
ta rge t , as a spec ies o f po ten t ia l conse rva t ion 
concern, but this would require finding a source 
o f surp lus ind iv idua ls in the Hong Kong reg ion .  
An alternative or additional possibility would be to 
reintroduce one or both of the carnivores that were 
lost from Hong Kong in the 1950s, the red fox and 
the large Indian civet.  Interactions between any 
carnivore introductions and the established feral 
cat population would be of particular interest.
Hong Kong’s protected area system already 
includes > 40% of the total land area (Fig. 2), with 
an additional ca. 20% protected from development 
by rugged topography.  As far as large mammals 
a re con ce rned , the ke y managemen t need i s 
the p ro tec t ion and , i f poss ib le , enhan cemen t , 
o f the l inks be tween ad jacen t p ro tec ted a reas , 
most of which are probably too small to support 
viable populations on their own.  Radio-telemetry 
studies are needed to understand how these links 
are used at present.  Habitat improvements and 
the protect ion of sma l l add it iona l areas may be 
needed to ensure that wildlife movements within 
Hong Kong con t inue to be poss ib le .  The las t 
potential corridor for terrestrial wildlife movements 
between the rest of China and Hong Kong is in the 
northeastern New Territories, where rural habitats 
in Hong Kong’s Frontier Closed Area abut similar 
habitats on the Shenzhen side of the border fence, 
especially the Sha Tau Kok area (Fig. 1), providing 
a link between Shenzhen’s 31 km2 Wutongshan 
Nat iona l Forest Park and Hong Kong ’s Country 
Park system.  None of this corridor receives formal 
protection at present, so development is a constant 
threat.  Urgent consideration should be given to 
preserving this link.

CONCLUSIONS

The main general conclusion from this study 
is that a diverse mammalian fauna can persist in 
a highly degraded tropical Asian landscape.  But 
how typ ica l is Hong Kong?  Mos t o the r a reas 
o f t rop i ca l Ea s t A s ia w i th a s im i la r deg ree o f 
landscape degradation appear to have much more 
highly impoverished mammalian faunas (pers. obs. 
by the au tho rs ) , a l though no in tens ive su rveys 
were done.  If these apparent differences are real, 
they almost certainly reflect the absence of recent 
hunting pressure in Hong Kong and its prevalence 
throughout almost all the rest of the region (Corlett 
2007 2009).  Hong Kong thus shows the potential 
for such landscapes, but not the current situation 
in most of them.
The large d i fferences be tween the curren t 
d i s t r i b u t i o n s o f m amm a l s p e c i e s w i t h i n H o n g 
Kong sugges t tha t h is to r ica l acc iden ts p layed 
m a j o r r o l e s i n t h e c om p o s i t i o n o f t h e f a u n a , 
with individual species expanding from their last 
refuges or reinvading Hong Kong after a relaxation 
of human pressures in rural areas over the last few 
decades.  We expect the same pattern to prevail 
elsewhere in tropical Asia when human pressures 
relax over the next 30-50 yr as a result of declining 
birth rates and rural-urban migration.  This in turn 
suggests that there will be many opportunities for 
conservation interventions to ensure that the newly 
ava i lab le hab itats are re-occup ied w ith the ir fu l l 
potential of mammalian faunas.  Hong Kong is an 
ideal place to practice this.
