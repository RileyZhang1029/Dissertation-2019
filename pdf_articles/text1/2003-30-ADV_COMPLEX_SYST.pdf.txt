This work is a theoretical study of fronts propagating into an uniaxial ferromagnetic
medium with velocity v , when the magnetization, M, is driven by a DC applied mag-
netic (cid:12)eld, H0 , from the demagnetized to the magnetized state. It is assumed that the
dynamics of M is govern by the Landau{Lifshitz{Gilbert equation (LLGE). We also
consider an e(cid:11)ective (cid:12)eld that includes in-plane uniaxial, HU , and shape anisotropy
(cid:12)elds, HD . We show that, in the particular case of uniformly translating pro(cid:12)les, this
equation reduces to a damped-forced Du(cid:14)ng’s equation, with a family of solutions that
describe periodic oscillating (PO), damped oscillating (DO) or exponential front pro-
(cid:12)les (EF). Of particular interest is the existence of a critical speed, v0 , below which
there are no stable states for the magnetization. When the velocity of the pro(cid:12)le exactly
equals vosc , the only stable states are the PO pro(cid:12)les. Above vosc , there is an asymp-
totic speed, v(cid:3) , that separates the DO pro(cid:12)les from EF pro(cid:12)les. This velocity (v (cid:3) ) is
connected with the existence of a non-linear marginal stability point for front propaga-
tion. Both v0 and v(cid:3) depend on the applied (cid:12)eld and on the anisotropy constants of the
material. A stability diagram for front propagation and magnetization curves are also
calculated.

Keywords : Fronts; magnetic waves; Du(cid:14)ng’s equation; non-linear dynamics.

1. Introduction

The study of front propagation in a physical system has been the sub ject of consider-
able attention in the last few years. Intuitively, a front is imagined as an interface
between two regions, and that this interface moves from one side to another. If
suddenly one region invades the other, then we say that a front is propagating into
that region. In general, a stable phase always moves towards an unstable phase.
This dynamics is commonly related with a kind of non-linear partial di(cid:11)erential
equations called in the literature di(cid:11)usion-reaction equations (DRE) [2, 11]. There

are many di(cid:11)erent types of fronts: solitons, shocks, dissipative, uniformly trans-
lating. These fronts arise in many (cid:12)elds of science such as biology [10], population
dynamics [13], chemistry [6], magnetism [14], mathematics [8], and so on. In all
these, fronts develop as domain walls separating an unstable state from some other
stable state. As it propagates, the velocity of the front approaches an asymptotic
value, so the shape of the pro(cid:12)le remains unchanged. Numerical studies indicate
that the velocity of the pro(cid:12)le of a front is selected via some common dynamical
mechanism, and that these selection mechanisms are always related to marginal
stability [15].
Traditionally, a conventional ferromagnetic material is treated as an arrange-
ment of homogeneously magnetized regions, called domains, interacting through an
interface or domain wall. Due to this interaction and below the Curie point, the
magnetization of the local domains align in some direction giving rise to a macro-
scopic magnetization moment. In the absence of an applied (cid:12)eld, this direction is
a preferred one and is called an easy axis. Hence, a magnetic (cid:12)eld must be applied
in order to push the magnetization away from this axis. When the magnetic (cid:12)eld is
applied, the initially magnetized state becomes unstable and the material is mag-
netized to saturation. The energy absorbed during this process is characterized as
uniaxial, and is measured by observing hysteresis loops or magnetization curves.
These materials are also called uniaxial ferromagnets.
During the magnetization rotation, and due to domain wall motion, magnetic
pulses, fronts and other pro(cid:12)les may propagate through a magnetic medium with a
well-de(cid:12)ned dynamics, which leads to various non-linear phenomena. On the other
hand, a magnetic material exhibits a non-linear relation between the magnetization
and the applied magnetic (cid:12)eld that a(cid:11)ects not only the switching process, but
also distorts magnetic pulses that propagate through the medium. Since magnetic
materials are commonly used for technical and practical applications, it is clear
that the study of non-linearities in these systems is of great importance.
In this work,
front propagation in a ferromagnetic system with uniaxial
anisotropy is studied. Based on the Landau{Lifshitz{Gilbert equation (LLGE) [7],
our calculations show that the dynamics of the magnetization is governed by a non-
linear di(cid:11)usion-reaction equation [8, 14], and the velocity of the magnetic front is
determined by a selection mechanism mainly due to the magnetic anisotropy of the
medium. This study enables us to obtain the magnetization curves and stability
diagrams for front propagation in a ferromagnetic medium.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we derive the non-linear partial
di(cid:11)erential equation that governs the dynamic of the magnetization in ferromag-
netic material with uniaxial anisotropy. In Sec. 3 we apply this equation to the
case of pro(cid:12)les uniformly translating through the system, and then we analyze
the asymptotic solutions. It is also shown that these particular states lead to the
damped-forced Du(cid:14)ng’s equation. Section 4 is devoted to solving numerically the
equation resulting from the analysis presented in Sec. 3. In Sec. 5 we summarize
our results.

2. Modeling a Ferromagnet

We start by assuming that the dynamics of the magnetization in a ferromagnet
(FM) is governed by the Landau{Lifschitz{Gilbert equation (LLGE) [7],

@
@ t

M = (cid:0)(cid:13)M (cid:2) H (cid:0) (cid:21)M (cid:2) M (cid:2) H ;

(1)

where (cid:13) and (cid:21), are the gyromagnetic ratio and the Gilbert damping parameter,
respectively, M is the magnetization, H = (cid:0)rM E is the e(cid:11)ective magnetic (cid:12)eld,
and E is the magnetic free energy. The (cid:12)rst term on the right-hand side repre-
sents the precessional torque exerted by the magnetic (cid:12)eld and the second term
is a damping torque due to viscous forces acting on the magnetization. For the
magnetic energy we used the Landau{Ginsburg free energy expanded in powers of
the magnetization near a critical point, which may be expressed as
E = (cid:0)H0 (cid:1) M + Xi
i (cid:0) Xi
M 2 M 2
The (cid:12)rst term on the right-hand side is the Zeeman energy, the second term rep-
resents the uniaxial energy, the third the demagnetizing energy, and the fourth the
exchange energy, with Kui , Di and J denoting the uniaxial anisotropy, demagne-
tizing and exchange constants, respectively. H0 is an external DC applied (cid:12)eld.
With the help of expression (2) and the de(cid:12)nition of the e(cid:11)ective (cid:12)eld, Eq. (1)
transforms into the 3 (cid:2) 3 system:

_My = (cid:0)(cid:13) (MzHx (cid:0) MxHz ) (cid:0) (cid:21)[Mz (MyHz (cid:0) MzHy ) (cid:0) Mx(MxHy (cid:0) MyHx )] ;
_Mz = (cid:0)(cid:13) (MxHy (cid:0) MyHx ) (cid:0) (cid:21)[Mx (MzHx (cid:0) MxHz ) (cid:0) My (MyHz (cid:0) MzHy )] ;

For the sake of simplicity, we will consider a FM of length, L, large compared
to its width, w(w (cid:28) L), and the thickness, t, su(cid:14)ciently small (t (cid:28) w), so that
r ! @ =@ x. The plane of the FM is in the (x; y)-plane and an external DC magnetic
(cid:12)eld, H0 , is applied along the axis of the material (x-axis). It is also considered that
the magnetization is completely in-plane (M 2
z (cid:28) M 2
x +M 2
(cid:24)= M 2 ), and both demag-
netizing and uniaxial (cid:12)elds are parallel to the x-axis. With all these assumptions,
Eqs. (3){(5) are rewritten as

Although the FM is magnetized in-plane, there is always a torque that pushes
the magnetization out-of-plane. To avoid this e(cid:11)ect, let us consider a damping
su(cid:14)ciently high that the torque part can be neglected, so that (cid:13) (cid:28) (cid:21) and _Mz (cid:25) 0.
Since Eqs. (7) and (8) are equivalent, our problem is reduced to solving Eq. (7)
together with the relation

M 2 = Mx(x; t)2 + My (x; t)2 = const :

(13)

Substitution of Eqs. (10), (11) and (13) into (7), lead to the non-linear partial
di(cid:11)erential equation for the magnetization:
’(x; t)(cid:19)2

_’(x; t) = (cid:0)a

(14)

where ’(x; t) = Mx(x; t)=M , Hu = 2Ku=M , HD = 2D=M , HE = J=M , a =
(cid:21)HEM , c0 = c2 = (cid:21)H0M , and c1 = c3 = (cid:21)(Hu (cid:0) HD )M . The resulting model
describes a one-dimensional mean-(cid:12)eld X Y model for a ferromagnet. Within the
mean-(cid:12)eld approximation, we assume that the only important con(cid:12)gurations near
the critical point are those of uniform magnetization density, i.e. @’=@ x = 0, so the
second term in Eq. (14) can be neglected, and it can be expressed in the (cid:12)nal form:

_’(x; t) (cid:24)= (cid:0)a

@ 2
@ x2 ’(x; t) + c3’(x; t)3 (cid:0) c2’(x; t)2 (cid:0) c1’(x; t) + c0 :

(15)

Equation (15) belong to a class of equations termed di(cid:11)usion-reaction. The case
H0 = 0, has no sense in the context of a ferromagnet, however when H0 6= 0 the
demagnetized state (’ = 0) becomes unstable, and the magnetization stabilizes
around some equilibrium state (’S (cid:20) 1). Here, we are interested in the case when
the magnetization is driven from the demagnetized state to a saturated state, by a
applied DC (cid:12)eld.

3. Wave Propagation and the Du(cid:14)ng’s Equation

The mathematical and physical theory of front propagation into magnetic media,
presents a number of unsolved problems. The most relevant are

(cid:15) How do magnetic fronts form in the material?
(cid:15) What is the stability of such a front?
(cid:15) How fast will a wave move through a magnetic medium?

All these questions become more clear by considering solutions of the type

’(x; t) = ’((cid:24) = x (cid:0) v t) ;

(16)

which connect the unstable state ’((cid:24) ) = 0 (demagnetized) and ’((cid:24) ) = ’S (cid:20) 1
(magnetized), or

’((cid:24) ) = 0 ;

’((cid:24) ) = ’S :

lim

(cid:24)!(cid:0)1

lim

(cid:24)!+1

(17)

(18)

These solutions are shape-preserving and move with constant velocity, v , and are
referred to in the literature as uniformly translating pro(cid:12)les [2]. These fronts occur
when the state emerging behind is homogeneous. Substitution of (16) into (15) gives
the ordinary non-linear equation:

v
a

d
d(cid:24)

’((cid:24) ) + c3’((cid:24) )3 (cid:0) c2’((cid:24) )2 (cid:0) c1’((cid:24) ) + c0 = 0 :

d2
d(cid:24) 2 ’((cid:24) ) +
This is the damped Du(cid:14)ng’s equation with a forced term [9]. It is apparent that this
equation has acceptable solutions for any value of v . However, according to other
authors [15, 17] there are some natural conditions for which dynamical velocity
selection takes place, and then the velocity of all acceptable fronts converge asymp-
totically to one particular value.
One of the most common methods for studying stability of fronts is the lineariza-
tion method [4]. For this, let us perturb the magnetized state (stable solution) with
a small term (cid:14)’ such that, ’ ! ’S (cid:0) (cid:14)’ as (cid:24) ! 1, where j(cid:14)’j (cid:28) ’S . Under this
perturbation the magnetization will relax at some rate around it equilibrium state.
Introducing the solution ’ = ’S (cid:0) (cid:14)’ into Eq. (19), and retaining only terms up
to (cid:12)rst order in (cid:14)’, we obtain the linear equation:

d2
d(cid:24) 2 (cid:14)’ +

v

d
d(cid:24)

(cid:14)’ + "(cid:14)’ = 0 ;

where

" = (3c3 (cid:0) 2c2 (cid:0) c1 )=a = 2(Hu (cid:0) HD (cid:0) H0 )=HE

with the corresponding characteristic polynomial:

The roots of this polynomial are given by
2a (cid:19)2

where we have de(cid:12)ned v (cid:3) = 2a"1=2 . This yields the following solutions:

Since we require that (cid:14)’ ! 0 as (cid:24) ! 1, we get the asymptotic form:

This expression gives the branch for asymptotic behavior, and is plotted in Fig. 1
for (cid:13) = 0:1. Every front pro(cid:12)le in this branch is purely exponential and propagates
with velocity v (cid:21) v (cid:3) = 2a"1=2 . Following van Saarloos’s argument [15], this region
is governed by a non-linear marginal-stability scenario, and the speed v = v (cid:3) is

i(v(cid:3)2 (cid:0) v2 )1=2 ], and the front oscillates with \natural frequency" v (cid:3) =2a = "1=2 , and
the damping parameter v=2a. These results are summarized in Fig. 2, where the
relation v(cid:3) = 2a"1=2 is plotted for some value of the parameter (HU (cid:0) HD )=HE .
This curve clearly di(cid:11)erentiates the oscillating fronts from the exponential front
pro(cid:12)les. Each point on this curve corresponds to a minimum in Eq. (27) for each
value of H0=HE and (HU (cid:0) HD )=HE , as shown in Fig. 1. Also, from relation (21) it
is noted that, as (HU (cid:0) HD )=HE increases the region of oscillatory pro(cid:12)les grows,
while for decreasing (HU (cid:0) HD )=HE the oscillations disappear and the only stable
states under perturbations are purely exponential front pro(cid:12)les.

4. Numerical Results

In order to understand the problem of wave propagation through a FM medium,
we must go back to Eq. (19). By means of a Runge{Kutta{Fehlberg scheme [5]
the damped-forced Du(cid:14)ng’s equation is solved numerically with the boundary con-
ditions (17) and (18), for several values of v , and magnetic (cid:12)elds in the range
0 (cid:20) H0 (cid:20) HE , and 0 (cid:20) HU (cid:20) HD (cid:20) HE . We obtain a family of solutions
that describe periodic oscillations (PO), damped oscillations (DO) or exponential
front pro(cid:12)les (EF), depending on the relative value of (HU (cid:0) HD )=HE , and the
wave speed, v . Representative results of these calculations performed on a tape of

there are no stable fronts.

normalized length (cid:24)=L are shown in Fig. 3. We found a critical velocity, v0 (H0 ),
below which there are no stable states for the magnetization. At v = v0 (H0 ), only
PO states are possible. For v > v0 (H0 ), M stabilizes around the state ’S ((cid:20) 1),
through damped oscillations (DO) up to the asymptotic value v (cid:3) (H0 ), where the
magnetized state rapidly invades the demagnetized state and an exponential front
begins to propagate. The dashed line correspond to the value of ’S around which
the magnetization stabilizes asymptotically. The di(cid:11)erent stability regions for a
magnetic tape are presented in Fig. 4, as a function of the DC magnetic (cid:12)eld. The
closed squares indicate the velocities observed in the stable solutions of Eq. (19).
The dashed curve is the asymptotic value determined by the relation v (cid:3) (H0 ). As
noted, the regions of DO and EF pro(cid:12)les are strongly dependent on (HU (cid:0)HD )=HE .
There also exists a region in which all states are unstable (US) and grows as
Fig. 3. Fermin,  J. R., et. al. 
(HU (cid:0) HD )=HE decreases. A small region of unstability is also observed with fronts
propagating with velocity v < vosc (shadowed). The region labeled as NA is phys-
ically inadmissible since ’S > 1. Although linearly stable, these fronts are not
accessible to the system. The dependence of the magnetized state, ’S , with respect
to the magnetic (cid:12)eld and the parameter (HU (cid:0) HD )=HE was also studied. For this,
the value of (HU (cid:0)HD )=HE was (cid:12)xed and the magnetic (cid:12)eld varied until the value of
’S was reached. In this manner, the magnetization curves for the ferromagnet were
obtained as a function of H0 for several values of (HU (cid:0) HD )=HE (closed symbols
in Fig. 5). The solid lines correspond to the solutions of the cubic equation:
(1 (cid:0) ’2 ) + (cid:18) HU (cid:0) HD
(cid:19)(1 (cid:0) ’2 )’ = 0 ;

which results from setting _’(x; t) = @ 2’(x; t)=@ x2 = 0, and are given by ’S = (cid:6)1,
H0=(HU (cid:0) HD ). The magnetization increases linearly with respect to the applied

Fig. 4. Stability diagrams for front propagation in a ferromagnetic material, as obtained from
solving numerically Eq. (19). All stability regions are clearly demarcated, as explained in the text.
The fronts in the shadow region are unstable. As HU (cid:0) HD increases the oscillating fronts invade
the exponential pro(cid:12)les.

(cid:12)eld up to saturation at a saturation (cid:12)eld HS (cid:24)= HU (cid:0) HD . As (HU (cid:0) HD )=HE is
increased, the system becomes magnetically harder. This shows that the dynamics
of the magnetization between states of di(cid:11)erent stability is controlled by the
anisotropy (cid:12)elds.

5. Concluding Remarks

In conclusion, we have shown that the dynamics of the magnetization in a ferromag-
netic material with uniaxial anisotropy is governed by a non-linear di(cid:11)usion-reaction
equation. In the important case of uniformly translating pro(cid:12)les, the propagation
of magnetic waves is governed by the damped-forced Du(cid:14)ng’s equation, and the
velocity of the pro(cid:12)les is determined by a selection mechanism mainly due to the
magnetic anisotropies of the material. When the initially demagnetized system is
perturbed by a DC applied (cid:12)eld damped oscillations and exponential front pro(cid:12)les
can propagate through the medium, depending on the value of the applied (cid:12)eld and
the internal anisotropy (cid:12)elds. This study allowed us to plot stability diagrams for
front propagation and magnetization curves in a ferromagnet.
