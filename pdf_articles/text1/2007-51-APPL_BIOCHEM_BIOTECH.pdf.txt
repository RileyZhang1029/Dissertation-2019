Abstract The aim of the present work is to improve the extraction of an aromatic
compound, 2E-hexenal, from a continuous liquid–gas reactor. Having an improved process
to recover hexenal could be of interest
to obtain this chemical
if produced by any
biotechnological process. The experimental program proposed on the basis of a full 23
factorial design demonstrated that the conditions optima for the extraction are 40°C as a
reactor temperature and −10°C as a temperature of trap for a nitrogen flow of 45 mL s
These conditions allowed to recover more than 75% of hexenal, when this compound was
stripping by a nitrogen stream from the liquid phase. The mass transfer was theoretically
and experimentally studied. The model predictions were validated against experimental
results obtained for a reactor, and good correlation was observed for a simulation.

Introduction

Hexenal in its different isomer forms is a key organoleptic element of green note that is
found in both fragrance and flavors. The 2E-hexenal which is commonly called leaf
aldehyde is widely distributed in fresh leaves, vegetables, and fruits. The traditional sources
of aroma compounds such as plant essential oils cannot give sufficient quantities of
hexenal. This motivated research efforts toward finding alternative natural ways that can
satisfy the increasing demand of this compound. Flavor and aroma can be derived from a
variety of metabolic pathways in plant system. For example hexenal isomers, mainly 3Z-
hexenal and 2E-hexenal, are organoleptically known to possess “green character”, and
therefore, are of commercial interest. They are formed through the lipoxygenase pathway
[1, 2] in which linolenic acid (C 18:3) is converted by the sequential action of lipoxygenase

and hydroperoxide-lyase into aldehydes. Schade et al. [3] used a crude enzyme preparation
from tomato fruit to produce hexanal in a packed-bed reactor coupled to a hollow fiber
system. In industrial applications of immobilized enzymatic reactions, this kind of reactor is
most often used as a continuous operating system because it is easily automated and
controlled, and its operating costs are low [4]. In general, to acquire quantitative and
qualitative information regarding the volatile compounds obtained after a synthetic step, it
was necessary first to isolate the volatile aroma constituents from the involatile bulk of the
medium by distillation [5] or head-space condensation [6]. A configuration that has
received much attention in recent years is the two-phase partitioning bioreactor. The
partition of both reactant and product between the two phases has several advantages
compared with monophasic systems. With this configuration, enzyme inhibition by the
substrate and/or the product may be smaller; also, the amount of water can be reduced to a
level that is just enough to saturate the organic solvent and maintain the activity of the
enzyme. A liquid–gas biphasic system is present also in many applications which involve
gassy substrate and/or product [7]. Herman et al. [7] have characterized the mass transfer
properties of shaken microtiter plates. In this study, the maximum oxygen transfer capacity,
the specific mass transfer area, and the mass transfer coefficient in a single well were
determined. In the liquid–gas biphasic system, the gas may bubble up through the liquid
without being circulated by a mechanical mixer.
The mathematical modeling of biological systems is important for understanding their
complex behavior. The purpose of this paper is to present a model for describing hexenal
transfer in liquid–gas reactor. This reactor can be applied in biocatalytic conversion using
the enzymes of the lipoxygenase pathway to produce hexenal [8–10]. A 23 factorial design
was used for choosing different parameters (nitrogen flow, temperature of the reactor, and
temperature of trap) and to find out their influence on the hexenal transfer. To evaluate the
liquid–gas mass transfer, a detailed mathematical model for the heterogeneous system was
developed.

Materials and Methods

Liquid–Gas Reactor Set-Up

A continuous reactor for the extraction of hexenal: 2E-hexenal (Sigma, France) has been
developed. This reactor was equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a thermometer, a pH
electrode, an inlet and outlet of gas. A bath was used to maintain and adjust the temperature
of the reactor. In the hermetic reactor, the extraction was achieved by passing nitrogen via
the inlet which bubbled up through the reactor containing 0.8 mM of hexenal in glycine
buffer pH 9. The hexenal was then removed with nitrogen through the outlet and finally
trapped in bath controlled at −10°C.

Improvement of the Hexenal Extraction: 23 Factorial Design

The improvement was achieved with a full 23 factorial design after an appropriate choice of
the most important variables implied in the transport phenomena of hexenal in liquid–gas
reactor. Application of this method requires the adequate selection of factors and levels.
Three quantitative parameters were studied (nitrogen flow, reactor temperature, and trap
temperature), and their effects on a response were investigated. Each factor was present at
two levels, + and −, which were used to represent the low and high levels of the factors,

respectively (Table 1). Selection of factors was based on the operating conditions that have
a significant influence on the transfer of hexenal in the reactor, and selection of levels was
carried out based on results obtained in preliminary studies. Eight runs representing
treatment combinations are shown in the design matrix as in Table 2.

Study of the Hexenal Transfer in the Liquid-Gas System

The rate of the hexenal transfer from the liquid to the gassy phase was studied to know the
time necessary for the extraction. Hexenal (0.8 mM) was put
in the 50 mL reactor
containing glycine buffer 0.2 M pH 9 with total liquid volume of 15 mL. The flask crossed
with nitrogen was connected at the exit to a flask put at −10°C and containing the hexane to
facilitate the trap of the hexenal during the gas flowing.

Saturating Hexenal Concentration in the Gas Phase

The hexenal was removed from the liquid phase to the gas phase until reaching the
saturation. This saturating concentration in the nitrogen has been determined experimentally
in a hermetic flask of 1.8 mL. Different concentrations of hexenal have been diluted in
800 μL of glycine buffer and nitrogen passed to fill the flask. To determine the saturating
concentration, an SPME fiber was completely placed in head-space during 20 min for the
hexenal extraction.

Sampling and Analysis of Volatiles

Hexenal concentration was measured by gas chromatography (GC). This compound was
separated on (HP 5890 capillary column; 30 m × 0.32 mm). Oven temperature was initially
−1 up to 220°C. Helium carrier gas was used
70°C and increased after injection at 13°C min
−1, and a flame ionization detector was set at 280°C. For
with a flow rate of 1 mL min
determining the saturating hexenal concentration in the gassy phase (nitrogen),
this
compound was trapped on SPME fiber (60 μm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene) and
was then thermally desorbed at 200°C for 2 min in the injector of GC.

Mathematical Model

Liquid–Gas Hexenal Transfer

It is important to designate two distinct hexenal concentrations in the partitioning reactor.
The model is based on material balance around the reactor. Balance is made for hexenal

Results and Discussion

The hexenal produced by lipoxygenase pathway has specific aromatic properties that can be
used in various applications due to its green note. The expensive extraction of this
compound has encouraged to search an easy way that allow to obtain a better efficiency of
extraction with keeping a high purity of the molecule.
The principal objective of this study was the use of a liquid–gas biphasic system for the
extraction of hexenal. This is a continuous agitated reactor in which hexenal continuously
leaves the reactor by passing nitrogen as a carrier gas through the liquid phase (glycine
buffer pH9) containing 0.8 mM of hexenal. The reactor temperature was maintained con-
stant during the extraction, and the hexenal was driven by nitrogen to be trapped at −10°C.
The first aspect of this research was the study of the variables influencing the transport of
hexenal from the liquid to the gassy phase. Three important parameters needed to be
improved. A quantitative study was performed with a 23 factorial design. The results
presented by this work showed the great potential of this method to achieve optimization in
a short number of experiments allowing the test of different parameters and the study of
their interactions. Temperature is one of the key parameters in liquid/gas system because it
has great
influence on the hexenal partition between liquid and gas phases. Two
temperatures were studied: the reactor temperature and the temperature of trap. The third
parameter studied was the flow of nitrogen.

Experimental Design

A 23 experimental design was performed. It consists of eight runs that allowed the study of
three parameters (see design matrix in Table 2). The values of each parameter at levels −
and + are given in Table 1. The response was determined by the calculation of the yield of
hexenal transfer. This yield was calculated for each treatment combination in the design
according to the following formula:

Y yield of the extraction
¼ ðconcentration of hexenal in the gassy phase=initial hexenal concentration
in the liquid phaseÞ  100:

All experiments were conducted in duplicates, and the results were obtained as the
average of the experiments under the same conditions (Table 2). According to the obtained
contrast coefficients (Table 2),
it maybe concluded that X1 (flow of nitrogen), X2
(temperature of the hexenal extraction), and X3 (temperature of trap) had an effect on the
transport of hexenal. X2 and X3 appears to be the most influencing. However, the factor
X1, when combined with the other factors, has an accentuated effect on the response. This
is demonstrated by the study of interactions (Table 2), which shows that interaction 12,
interaction 13, and the interaction of third order 123 has a significant contrast coefficients.
The important yield of transfer (77%) was given for 40°C as reactor temperature and −10°C
as temperature of the trap. These conditions (run 3) allowed a sixfold increase in the
transfer of hexenal, when compared to run 5 in which the same flow of nitrogen was kept,
and the other parameters were changed.

Transport Phenomena

The second aspect of this study was to analyze the transport phenomena such as mass
transfer between the liquid and gas phases that causes a gradient in the concentration of
hexenal. Thus, to provide adequate hexenal transfer from the liquid to the gas phases, the
conditions improved previously must be carefully adjusted. The mass transfer coefficient
calculated using Eq. 2 was used to determine the rate of hexenal transfer from the liquid to
the gassy phase in the biphasic medium (glycine buffer/nitrogen). The observed mass
transfer coefficient related to the gas phase corresponds to a value of 0.17 m s

The hexenal transfer rate can be described using the Eq. 1: d Ad
Figure (1) shows the saturating hexenal concentration in the gas phase (Ads). This
concentration was determined experimentally in the nitrogen phase and was then analyzed
with the SPME system. The data shows that this concentration was 0.5 mM. The progress
curve of the hexenal transferred to the gas phase was determined in the biphasic system at
the conditions previously improved with the experimental design (Fig. 2).
The coefficient of the mass transfer determined theoretically and the saturating hexenal
concentration determined experimentally were used to simulate the transfer in the biphasic
system using the Matlab program. The model simulates the evolution of reactants in the
system as a function of time. The resulting simulated transfer progress curve and the
experimental data are shown together in Fig. 2. The values given by the program are close
to those determined experimentally. This shows a good correspondence between the ex-
perimentally determined and the modeled evolution of the hexenal concentration in the gas
phase of the reactor. Modeled rate agreed with that determined experimentally. The
aldehyde transport was stabilized at 20 min of the extraction, and the yield of hexenal
transfer in the gas phase reached 77%.

Conclusion

The hexenal mass transfer in a liquid/gas biphasic system has been studied. The
characteristics of the transport phenomena were investigated. The influence of the
temperature and the flow of nitrogen were quantified. It was shown that temperature was
the most important parameter affecting the transfer of aldehyde to the gas phase in the
reactor.
With improved knowledge of this phenomenon, the actual mass transfer of hexenal in
the two-phase system can be predicted with greater confidence and will be used in our
modeling activities to predict the performance of the two-phase partitioning reactor. The
extraction approach described here can serve later for the recovery of volatiles produced in
enzymatic reactors using the enzymes of lipoxygenase pathway. The results found in this
research demonstrated that the extraction of hexenal by passing nitrogen as a carrier gas
through the liquid phase gives a maximum yield of transfer of 77%.
