Cell-free translation reconstituted with purified
components

Kazuya Nishikawa3, and Takuya Ueda2*

We have developed a protein-synthesizing system reconstituted from recombinant tagged protein factors puri-
fied to homogeneity. The system was able to produce protein at a rate of about 160 µ g/ml/h in a batch mode
without the need for any supplementary apparatus. The protein products were easily purified within 1 h using
affinity chromatography to remove the tagged protein factors. Moreover, omission of a release factor allowed
efficient incorporation of an unnatural amino acid using suppressor transfer RNA (tRNA).

The development of cell-free strategies based on purified enzymes is
an expanding field in biotechnology. DNA polymerases have made it
possible to amplify DNA rapidly and efficiently by PCR without the
need for cloning. RNA polymerases are used to synthesize novel
RNA molecules through in v itro evolution methods. Reverse tran-
scriptases generate complementary DNA (cDNA), which does not
exist in natural living systems. The availability of these purified
enzymes essential to the “central-dogma” pathway of molecular biol-
ogy has removed many of the constraints in conventional gene-
manipulation techniques that rely on living cells. So far, however, the
translation process has eluded efficient reconstitution in v itro, in
large part because of its complexity. The achievement of this goal
would offer advantages in many areas of biotechnology.
Two approaches have guided efforts to achieve cell-free transla-
tion. One approach, developed over the past decade, is based on
crude cell extract, often derived from Escherichia coli, rabbit reticulo-
cytes, or wheat germ1,2. But the use of such extracts inevitably
encounters two problems: a rapid depletion of energy charge, inde-
pendent of peptide bond formation3,4, and degradation of protein
products or template nucleic acids by proteases or nucleases. These
problems have been partly overcome by a continuous-flow cell-free
protein-synthesis system5,6.
The second approach attempts to reconstitute protein synthesis
from purified components of the translation machinery. More than
100 molecules participate in prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation,
many of which have been individually purified for biochemical stud-
ies of their functions and structures. In 1977, Weissbach’s group
endeavored to reconstitute a translation system using purified solu-
ble components7 but did not achieve a satisfactory production of
proteins, perhaps because of a complex purification protocol and the
absence of release factor 3 (RF3) and ribosome-recycling factor
(RRF). A few years later, Ganoza and co-workers reconstructed a
cell-free translation system from precharged aminoacyl-tRNAs and
purified translation factors8. Although this system did not require
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the tRNAs were not recycled, resulting
in low productivity. More recently, Pavlov and co-workers produced
an in v itro translation system using a partially purified aminoacyl-
tRNA synthetase mixture with purified translation factors9. They
also constructed a completely purified in v itro translation system

using short artificial messenger RNA (mRNA)10. However, this sys-
tem lacked a full set of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and its produc-
tivity was relatively low.
Here we describe a cell-free translation system reconstructed from
purified histidine (His)-tagged translation factors and “pro-
grammed” by natural mRNA. The system—termed the “protein syn-
thesis using recombinant elements” (PURE) system—contains all
necessary translation factors, purified with high specific activity, and
allows efficient protein production. We succeeded in producing
active dihydrofolic acid reductase (DHFR) with a productivity on
the order of submilligrams in a 1 ml reaction volume. The PURE sys-
tem is also advantageous in terms of product purification. Protein
products in the native form (with no His tag) were purified easily
and rapidly through ultrafiltration followed by affinity chromatog-
raphy to remove the His-tagged translation factors. Omission of
release factor 1 (RF1) allowed the suppression of an amber codon
using chemically synthesized UAG-specific suppressor tRNA with a
chemically attached valine (Val–tRNAsup), demonstrating that the
PURE system can be used for the efficient synthesis of proteins con-
taining unnatural amino acids.

Results

The PURE system. Protein biosynthesis proceeds in three steps: ini-
tiation, elongation, and termination. In E. coli, the translation factors
responsible for completing these steps are three initiation factors
(IF1, IF2, and IF3), three elongation factors (EF-G, EF-Tu, and EF-
Ts), and three release factors (RF1, RF2, and RF3), as well as RRF for
termination. However, RF2 is not required for the translation of
genes terminating with the codons UAG or UAA. The PURE system
includes 32 components that we purified individually : IF1, IF2, IF3,
EF-G, EF-Tu, EF-Ts, RF1, RF3, RRF, 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
(ARSs), methionyl-tRNA transformylase (MTF), T7 RNA poly-
merase, and ribosomes. In addition, the system contains 46 tRNAs,
NTPs, creatine phosphate, 10-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid, 20
amino acids, creatine kinase, myokinase, nucleoside-diphosphate
kinase, and pyrophosphatase.
Purification of translation factors. We overexpressed in E. coli and
purified IF1, IF2, IF3, EF-G, EF-Tu, EF-Ts, RF1, RF3, RRF, 20 ARSs,
MTF, and T7 RNA polymerase. We reconstructed these genes in the

We evaluated the activities of RF1,
RF3, and RRF by determining peptide
release from ribosomes according to
the method of Pavlov et al.10, using a
short synthetic mRNA (mMFL) with
the 
sequence AUGUUCUUGUAA,
corresponding to fMet–Phe–Leu–Stop
(fMFL). Complete peptide release was
dependent on the presence of RF1
(Table 1). The addition of RRF signifi-
cantly increased the amount of peptide
released and gave multiple-turnover
protein synthesis. The observation that
the turnover rate mediated by RF1 and
RRF was enhanced by supplementation
with RF3 indicated that RF3 was puri-
fied as the active form.
From the results of the two experi-
ments, we concluded that all the puri-
fied 
translation components were
active despite the His tags.
Additonal information about the
cloning vectors used for expression of
the translation factors and enzymes, the
yields following purification, the con-
centrations and specific activities of the
purified proteins, and the units used per 50 µ
l reaction is available on
the Web Extras page of Nature Biotechnology Online.
Protein synthesis. We next addressed the construction of the
transcription/translation-coupled PURE system using the purified
translation components and T7 RNA polymerase. The PURE sys-
tem was able to synthesize DHFR of E. coli, λ -lysozyme, green fluo-
rescent protein (GFP), g lutathione S-transferase (GST), and bacte-
riophage T7 gene 10 product as full-length polypeptides (Fig . 2).
Except for GST, more than 100 µ g of each protein was produced in
a 1 ml reaction volume after 1 h (Fig . 2). Although we could not
explain the low production of GST, we concluded that the PURE
system contains all the components essential for translation.
We measured the enzymatic activ ity of the DHFR, the bacter i-
oly tic ability of the λ -lysozyme, and the GFP fluorescence, and

achieving effective purification. Figure 1 shows the sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) gel patterns
of the purified translation factors (Fig. 1A) and enzymes (Fig. 1B).
The electrophoretic pattern indicated that the proteins were purified
to homogeneity.
Activities of the purified translation components. We evaluated
the activities of the purified translation factors and enzymes except
for RF1, RF3, and RRF from the reduction in protein synthesis
caused by excluding each component in turn from the PURE system
(Fig. 1C). The results indicated that most of the components were
indispensable for translation and simultaneously ruled out the pos-
sibility of sample contamination by other E. coli proteins. The results
also suggested that IF1 and MTF were least essential for protein syn-
thesis. These observations are consistent with previous reports
showing that deletion of the gene for MTF results in an extreme
reduction of the viability but not the lethality of E. coli11, and that
formation of the initiation complex can be achieved in the absence
of IF1 (ref. 12). However, it is likely that IF1 and MTF contribute to
the efficiency and accuracy of protein synthesis.

The translation reaction was done according to the method of Pavlov et al.10 with
a slight modification using a shor t synthetic mRNA (mMFL) with the sequence
AUGUUCUUGUAA, corresponding to fMet-Phe-Leu-Stop (fMFL). Reaction mix-
tures (50 µ
l) containing 50 pmol 35S-labeled formyl methionyl-tRNAMet with each
termination factor subtracted in turn were pre-incubated at 37°C for 5 min, fol-
lowed by the addition of 1 µ g MFL mRNA. An aliquot (5 µ
l) was withdrawn after
8 min of incubation and added to the same volume of 1 N HCl. The tripeptides
(fMFL) were extracted by ethyl acetate and the radioactivity was measured.

Figure 3. Productivity and energy consumption of the PURE system.
(A) Time course of DHFR synthesis. Translation reactions used ribosome
concentrations of 1.2 µ M (쎲), 2.4 µ M (왖), or 3.6 µ M (쑗). Reaction
mixtures contained 0.3 mM amino acids to prevent amino acid “starvation.”
The concentrations of EF-G, EF-Tu, and EF-Ts are intensified threefold,
fivefold (왖), and sevenfold (쑗). (B) Abor tive energy consumption in the
PURE and S30 systems. The decrease in the energy charge of each

found that these proteins were synthesized in their active forms.
The specific activ ity of the synthesized DHFR was 16.7 ±
1.1
U/mg , which is similar to the specific activ ity value of DHFR that
we overexpressed in cells and pur ified (16.0 ± 0.80 U/mg). From
these data we concluded that the components of the PURE system
are sufficient to produce active proteins.
Monitoring of the time course of DHFR synthesis at different
ribosome concentrations showed that in each case the reaction rate
decreased after 1 h (Fig. 3A). To clarify the cause of this deceleration,
we simultaneously monitored the biochemical energy level, or ener-
gy charge,—defined by Atkinson13 as ([ATP] + 1/2[ADP])/([ATP] +
[ADP] + [AMP])—in the reaction mixture. Despite supplementa-
tion of the energy-recycling system consisting of creatine kinase,
myokinase, and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, the energy charge
decreased to <30% after 1 h. Thus, it is likely that reaction quenching
resulted mainly from a deprivation of chemical energy. The PURE
system showed no abortive energy consumption, whereas in a crude
cell extract system most nucleotide triphosphates were hydrolyzed
regardless of protein synthesis (Fig. 3B). The PURE system is there-
fore very efficient in terms of energy conversion.
Product purification. Taking advantage of the fact that most com-
ponents of the PURE system exist in the His-tagged form, we designed
the purification process shown in Figure 4A. After the protein-synthesis
reaction was terminated, ribosomes were removed by ultrafiltration
using a membrane with a cutoff of 100 kDa. Next, His-tagged compo-
nents were eliminated by passage through a Ni2+ column. We analyzed
the purity of the product by SDS–PAGE and found that we had
obtained highly purified DHFR (Fig. 4B). The purification steps in the
PURE system can be completed within a few hours, including the 
protein-synthesis reaction. Moreover, the target protein is expressed
and purified in its native form without any tag.
Incorporation of unnatural amino acids. One of the great advan-
tages of cell-free translation is the ease of incorporating unnatural
amino acids14. We attempted to develop the PURE system in this
respect by omitting the release factor RF1. Suppression of an amber
codon using Val–tRNAsup was employed as a model for unnatural-
amino-acid incorporation. The template for the experiment was a
mutant DHFR mRNA in which the codon UAG was substituted for
the Asn37 codon, terminated by the RF2-specific codon UGA. In this
case, RF1 cannot be used as a termination factor and we prepared
RF2 to substitute for RF1. Although the PURE system in the presence

purification procedures. Ribosome was first eliminated by ultrafiltration

components were eliminated by passage through a Ni2+ column. (B) Purity

of RF1 produced a truncated protein terminating at UAG, omission
of RF1 resulted in an extremely faint band corresponding to the trun-
cated protein, which is likely to have resulted from single-turnover
synthesis (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). Addition of Val–tRNAsup produced a
full-length protein, with complete disappearance of the truncated
protein. This finding suggested highly efficient read-through of the
UAG codon by suppressor tRNA. Thus, the PURE system is able to
insert an amino acid corresponding to a particular termination
codon, indicating that it can be used to synthesize proteins contain-
ing unnatural amino acids.

Discussion

We have demonstrated here that the PURE system for reconstitut-
ing translation from purified translation factors is capable of pro-
ducing active proteins from template nucleic acids in considerable
amounts. Because it uses only highly purified components, the sys-
tem is free of inhibitory substances such as nucleases, proteases, and
enzymes that hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates. ATPase activity
in the PURE system was observed to be low, in contrast to the rapid
energy depletion seen when the conventional S30 extract of E. coli
(Fig. 3B) was used. Although the productivity of the PURE system
was generally higher than that of the S30 systems we examined, it
has not yet surpassed that reported by Kim et al., in which protein
was produced at 400 µ g/ml in batch culture15. However, that system
contained fivefold more creatine phosphate (50 mM) than ours,
and its reaction conditions—such as the addition of polyethylene
glycol15—also differed considerably. Because energy conversion in
the PURE system is highly efficient, we estimate that its protein pro-
ductivity in relation to the concentration of the energy source is
high compared with that of S30 systems. Moreover, optimization of
the PURE system is not yet complete; further study of the reaction
conditions should allow us to improve its productivity.
We consider the PURE system as a tool not only for producing
natural proteins but also for synthesizing unnatural proteins with
new functions. The finding that omitting particular factors from the
reaction mixture largely stopped the reaction (Fig. 1C and Table 1)
suggests various strategies for artificially controlling protein synthe-

additional 4 h at 37°C. Collected cells were resuspended in a buffer (50 mM
N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N’-[2-ethanesulfonic acid] (HEPES)–KOH,
pH 7.6, 1 M NH4Cl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1% Triton X-100,
0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 7 mM β -mercap-
toethanol) and were lysed by sonication. Cell debris was removed by cen-
trifugation at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4°C and the supernatant was applied to a
Ni2+ precharged 10-ml Hi-Trap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL) and was washed w ith 100 ml HT buffer 
(50 mM HEPES–KOH, pH 7.6, 1 M NH4Cl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 7 mM 
β -mercaptoethanol) containing 10 mM imidazole. Factors were eluted w ith
a linear gradient from 10 mM to 400 mM imidazole in HT buffer. Fractions
containing His-tagged protein were dialyzed against a stock buffer (50 mM
HEPES–KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 30% g lycerol, and 
7 mM β -mercaptoethanol) and were frozen in small aliquots at -80°C.

Construction of template plasmids used for translation. The gene used for
the translation experiment was cloned into vector pET17b, pET29a
(Novagen), pUC18 (Takara, Shuzo, Japan), or pGEMEX-2 (Promega,
Madison, WI). The gene contained a T7 promoter upstream of a ribosome-
binding site with the “epsilon sequence” originating from bacteriophage T7
gene 10 (ref. 20) followed by a Shine–Dalgarno sequence. The plasmid encod-
ing the N37Amber DHFR mutant was constructed using a QuickChange site-
directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid encoding the
gene for mMFL was transcribed according to the method of Sampson and
Uhlenbeck21 with a slight modification.

Translation reaction. Unless otherw ise specified, the standard translation
mixtures (50 µ
l) were prepared as follows: reaction mixtures were general-
ly prepared in polymix buffer as descr ibed before22,23 w ith a slight modifi-
cation. Reaction mixtures contained 9 mM magnesium acetate, 5 mM
potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 95 mM potassium g lutamate, 5 mM ammo-
nium chlor ide, 0.5 mM calcium chlor ide, 1 mM spermidine, 8 mM
putrescine, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mM each ATP and GTP, 1 mM
each of CTP and UTP, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 2.8 A260 units tRNA mix
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany), 0.5 µ g 10-formyl-5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydrofolic
acid, 0.1 mM each of amino acids, and factor mix. The factor mix con-
tained 12 pmol r ibosome, 1 µ g IF1, 2 µ g IF2, 0.75 µ g IF3, 1 µ g EF-G, 2 µ g
EF-Tu, 1 µ g EF-Ts, 0.5 µ g RF1, 0.5 µ g RF3, 0.5 µ g RRF, 30–300 units of
each ARS and MTF, 0.2 µ g creatine kinase (Roche), 0.15 µ g myokinase
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.054 µ g nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, 0.1 units
pyrophosphatase (Sigma), and 0.5 µ g T7 RNA polymerase. The final con-
centrations of these components, except for the ARSs, were determined by
dose-response translation exper iments. Activ ities of the ARSs conformed
to aminoacylation activ ities in S100 cell extract. After the reaction mixture
was incubated at 37°C for 5 min, the template plasmid was added and the
reaction was incubated at 37°C. The reaction was carr ied out for one hour
and terminated on ice.

Product analysis. Synthesized proteins containing [35S]methionine were
separated by 12% SDS–PAGE. The radioactivity of each product was mea-
sured and the yield was calculated. The activity of DHFR was measured
according to the method of Poe et al.24, with a slight modification. The λ -
lysozyme assay was done according to the method of Schleif et al25.
Fluorescence spectra of GFP were measured with a spectrofluorometer (type
850; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).
Measurement of energy charge. Translation reaction mixtures containing [α -
32P]ATP and 1.2 µ M ribosome without GTP, UTP, CTP, amino acids, template
DNA, and components of the energy-recycling system were incubated at 37°C.
Aliquots (2 µ
l) were withdrawn at different incubation times and added to 
150 µ
l 10% formic acid. An aliquot (0.5 µ
l) of this was then spotted onto a
polyethyleneimine thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate and the reaction
products were separated in 0.75 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 3.75; then
the TLC plates were dried for autoradiography. The S30 extract was purchased
from Promega (Madison, WI).

Fig. 5. Suppression of an amber codon using Val–tRNAsup in the PURE
system. The in vitro suppression reaction included 20 µ
l of RF1-deprived
PURE system, as well as 0.2 A260 unit suppressor tRNA-Val. The DHFR
template (lane 1) and the N37Amber DHFR template (lanes 2–4) were
translated in the PURE system containing RF2 substituted for RF1. A
truncated peptide terminating at UAG is produced in the PURE system
containing RF1 (lane 2), whereas subtraction of RF1 produces an
extremely faint band corresponding to the truncated peptide (lane 3),
which is likely to be the result of synthesis for a single turnover. Addition of
Val–tRNAsup produces a full-length peptide, whereas the truncated
peptide completely disappears (lane 4).

sis—strategies that would not be possible in crude-cell-extract 
systems. Subtraction of RF1 from the PURE system enabled com-
plete conversion of the termination codon to a sense codon (Fig. 5).
With a crude cell extract, competition between suppressor tRNA and
termination factors inevitably causes inefficient incorporation of the
amino acid corresponding to the termination codon. In the PURE
system, this problem is overcome simply by omitting a termination
factor. A similar approach might be adopted with other components,
such as particular aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Substitution of
native aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases with mutant synthetases having
new specificities should enable the construction of a translation sys-
tem founded on a noncanonical genetic code.
In other experiments, we succeeded in producing proteins using
an mRNA-directed PURE system (data not shown), but found vari-
able productiv ity depending on the template mRNAs used. This
variability may arise from mRNA secondary structure. Because the
PURE system lacks RNA helicases, it may be more susceptible to
this problem than a crude-cell-extract system. However, this prob-
lem could be addressed by the addition of RNA helicases. We are
evaluating the influence of mRNA secondary structure on transla-
tion efficiency using the mRNA-directed PURE system. The PURE
system w ill also allow us to examine many factors that interact w ith
the translation apparatus, including chaperones and several factors
thought to stimulate translation efficiency8,16–18.

Experimental protocol

Construction of plasmids for overexpression of components of the PURE
system. The genes encoding ARS, MTF, T7 RNA polymerase, nucleoside-
diphosphate kinase, IF1, IF2, IF3, EF-G, EF-Tu, EF-Ts, RF1, RF2, RF3, and RRF
were amplified by PCR from the E. coli genome and cloned into vector pET21a
(Novagen, Madison, WI), pQE30, or pQE60 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to gener-
ate each His-tagged factor plasmid. The plasmids obtained were transformed
into E. coli BL21/pREP4 (pQE series) or BL21/DE3 (pET series) strains.

Preparation of PURE system components. Tightly coupled ribosomes were
purified from E. coli A19 cells by sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation
according to the method of Spedding19. His-tagged protein was purified as
follows: BL21 cells w ith each vector were grown to an OD600 of 0.5–0.9 in
2–6 L Luria–Bertani (LB) broth. Isopropyl- β -D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was
added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and the cells were grown for an

Purification of product. The DHFR template was translated for 1 h at 37°C in
reaction mixtures containing 2.4 µ M ribosome. After termination of the
translation, the reaction mixtures were loaded onto a Centricon 100 device
(Millipore, Bedford, MA) and centrifuged, and the flowthrough was recov-
ered. Aliquots obtained were then loaded onto Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) and
the flowthrough was recovered.
