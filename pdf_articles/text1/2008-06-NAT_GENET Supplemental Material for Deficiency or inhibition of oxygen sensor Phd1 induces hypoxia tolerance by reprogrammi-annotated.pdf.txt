SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES 

GENERATION OF MICE LACKING PHD1 

To inactivate the Phd1 gene, we constructed targeting vectors in which a fragment 
encoding part of the catalytic domain conferring the prolyl hydroxylase activity 1, (exon 2 and 
3 
for Phd1), was replaced by a neomycin phosphotransferase selection cassette 
(Supplementary Figure 1). The targeting vector was electroporated in embryonic stem (ES) 
cells and homologous recombination was confirmed by appropriate Southern blot analysis 
(Supplementary Figure 1). Targeted ES cell clones were used to generate Phd1-/- mice, which 
were born at the expected Mendelian frequencies and were healthy.  

NORMAL ERYTHROPOIESIS, OXYGEN DELIVERY, VASCULARIZATION AND MYOGLOBIN 
LEVELS IN PHD1-/- MICE 

ERYTHROPOIESIS & OXYGEN DELIVERY: Phd1-/- mice had normal hematocrits (31.4 ± 0.9% in 
wild-type mice versus 32.9 ± 1.2% in Phd1-/- mice; n = 8; P = n.s), hemoglobin levels (not 
shown), and arterial blood gases (PaO2 and O2 saturation: 132 ± 6 mmHg and 98.5 ± 0.4% in 
wild-type mice versus 132 ± 7 mmHg and 98.1 ± 0.4% in Phd1-/- mice; n = 5; P = n.s.).

- 2 - 

Therefore induced erythropoiesis or oxygen delivery does not explain Phd1-/- myofibers 
protection.  

VASCULARIZATION: At seven days after hindlimb ischemia, the total number of collateral side 
branches was not increased in the adductor region in Phd1-/- limbs (second-generation 
collateral side branches/mm2: 22.7 ± 3.1 in wild-type mice versus 22.5 ± 5 in Phd1-/- mice; n = 
7; P = n.s.). The collateral perfusion area, representing the sum of the luminal areas of all 
secondary and tertiary collaterals, was also not significantly altered in Phd1-/- limbs (total 
collateral perfusion area in µm2/mm2: 2,290 ± 282 in wild-type mice versus 2,560 ± 241 in 
Phd1-/- mice; n = 7; P = n.s.). Moreover, capillary density, assessed in viable crural muscle 
areas after seven days of ischemia, was unaltered in Phd1-/- mice (capillaries/mm2: 720 ± 80 
in wild-type mice versus 702 ± 56 in Phd1-/- mice; n = 7; P = n.s.). In accordance with these 
findings, mRNA levels of Vegf were similar in baseline conditions and comparably increased 
at 4 to 6 hours after ischemia in both genotypes (not shown), altogether indicating that the 
hypoxic angiogenic stimulus and revascularization response were comparable in both 
genotypes.  

MYOGLOBIN: Myoglobin, a cytoplasmic hemoprotein expressed in cardiac myocytes and 
oxidative skeletal muscle fibers, reversibly binds O2, therefore serving as an intracellular 
oxygen supply/buffering system. By qRT-PCR analysis, myoglobin transcript levels were 
unaltered in Phd1-/- myofibers (not shown). ELISA revealed also no significant differences in 
myoglobin protein levels in soleus muscle (µg myoglobin/mg total protein: 40.6 ± 8.8 in wild-
type versus 35.5 ± 6.6 in Phd1-/-; n = 3; P = n.s.) and gastrocnemius muscle (µg 
myoglobin/mg total protein: 10.8 ± 1.04 in wild-type versus 9.46 ± 0.28 in Phd1-/-; n = 3; P = 
n.s.). In addition, when analyzing active myoglobin content employing a peroxidase-based 
activity assay 2, we could not detect any genotypic differences in soleus muscle (µg O2 bound 
myoglobin/mg total protein: 69.8 ± 7.6 in wild-type versus 79.7 ± 12.4 in Phd1-/-; n = 5; P = 
n.s.) or gastrocnemius muscle (µg O2 bound myoglobin/mg total protein: 21.7 ± 2.1 in wild-
type versus 25.7 ± 4.1 in Phd1-/-; n = 5; P = n.s.).  

NORMAL VASODILATION AFTER FEMORAL ARTERY LIGATION IN PHD1-/- MICE 

23.10 .07 9:42 AM  

- 3 - 

Since enhanced reactive vasodilation of pre-existing collateral vessels after femoral 
artery ligation might also account for muscle survival in Phd1-/- limbs and Hif’s induce a 
vasodilatory response, we monitored the perfusion of skin vessels (as surrogate for the 
unaccessible deeper collateral vessels) by laser-Doppler imaging. Skin perfusion increased 
significantly during the first six hours of ischemia, however, this compensatory increase was 
comparable in both genotypes (fold-increase of ischemic / contralateral perfusion ratio after 6 
hours of ischemia: 1.9 ± 0.3 in wild-type mice versus 1.5 ± 0.3 in Phd1-/- mice; n = 3; P = n.s.). 

PRESERVED MITOCHONDRIAL PERFORMANCE IN ISCHEMIC PHD1-/- MYOFIBERS  

To assess whether mitochondrial performance was better preserved in ischemic Phd1-
/- myofibers because of the reduced oxidative stress, we measured mitochondrial respiration 
rates of skeletal muscle mitochondria, isolated from mice in baseline conditions and at 6 
hours after femoral artery ligation. The activity of the respiratory electron transfer chain was 
determined by measuring how rapidly mitochondria consumed a fixed amount of oxygen in 
the absence of ADP (state 2 respiration) and in the presence of ADP (when oxygen 
consumption is enhanced to generate ATP; state 3 respiration). We focused on state 3 
respiration as it is more sensitive to ischemic insults than state 2 respiration. Succinate was 
added as an oxidizable substrate and electron donor to complex II of the respiratory chain. 
Because large amounts of mitochondria were required to perform these measurements, 
gastrocnemius muscles from 6 mice were pooled; data of one of two representative 
experiments are shown.  
In wild-type mice, ischemia caused a 35% reduction in state 3 respiration rate (state 3 
respiration rate, relative to the state 2 respiration rate in wild-type mice at normoxic 
conditions: 3.2 in normoxic versus 2.1 in hypoxic muscle). In contrast, in Phd1-/- mice, 
ischemia only insignificantly reduced state 3 respiration rate by 7% (state 3 respiration rate, 
relative to the state 2 respiration rate in normoxic wild-type mitochondria: 2.9 in normoxic 
versus 2.7 in hypoxic muscle), indicating that mitochondrial function was not (or only 
minimally) impaired in Phd1-/- muscle. Thus, in the absence of Phd1, mitochondria are 
capable of functioning (relatively) normally, even after exposure to severe ischemia.  

FATTY ACID OXIDATION IN ISCHEMIC PHD1-/- FIBERS 

23.10 .07 9:42 AM  

- 4 - 

Oxidation of [U-13C]-fatty acids was undetectable in ischemic wild-type myofibers, while 
proceeding at some residual level in ischemic Phd1-/- muscles ([4,5-13C2]-glutamate peak, % 
of total creatine: undetectable (<0.007%) in wild-type mice versus 0.06 ± 0.02% in Phd1-/- 
muscle; n = 6; P < 0.05). Compared to the corresponding baseline values, fatty acid oxidation 
in ischemic wild-type and Phd1-/- myofibers proceeded at <5% and 50% of its normal rate, 
respectively.  

EVALUATION OF EFFICIENCY AND SPECIFICITY OF PHD1 SPECIFIC KNOCKDOWN  

The efficiency and specificity of shPhd1KD and shPhd1CTR were first tested in cultured 
murine C2C12 myoblast cells. Compared to non-transfected cells, transfection of C2C12 cells 
with shPhd1CTR did not affect Phd1 transcript levels (mRNA copies PHD1/103 mRNA copies 
ß-actin: 12.0 ± 1.0 after vehicle versus 11.3 ± 0.3 after shPhd1CTR; n = 4; P = n.s.). In 
contrast, shPhd1KD efficiently lowered Phd1 mRNA levels by 72 % (mRNA copies Phd1/103 
mRNA copies ß-actin: 3.4 ± 0.5 after shPhd1KD; n = 4; P < 0.05 versus shPhd1CTR). shPhd1KD 
did not knock down Phd2 or Phd3 (not shown). We then injected and electroporated these 
constructs into the muscle fibers in vivo, as this method is very efficient and causes negligible 
muscle damage and inflammation.  

The constructs were electroporated five days prior to the ligation of the femoral artery 
because of two reasons: (i) to achieve sufficient elimination of the pre-existing Phd1 
transcripts prior to the induction of ischemia; and (ii) to avoid death of ischemic myofibers 
before their Phd1 transcript levels would be sufficiently reduced to provide protection. Both 
the right and left hindlimb muscles were electroporated, but only the right femoral artery was 
ligated, permitting us to use the right legs for histological scoring of muscle necrosis and the 
left muscles for RNA analysis. To obtain sufficiently low endogenous Phd1 levels after Phd1 
knockdown, we used Phd1+/- mice, which only expressed 50% of the Phd1 transcript levels 
present in wild-type mice (not shown).  

SUPPLEMENTARY EXPERIMENTAL METHODS  

TARGETING VECTORS AND GENE INACTIVATION 

23.10 .07 9:42 AM  

- 5 - 

For construction of the Phd1 targeting vector, the following fragments were cloned in 
pKOScramblerNTKV-1908 (from 5’ to 3’): a 5 Kb EcoRV/XhoI fragment located 0.85 Kb 
upstream of exon 2 (5’ homologous flank), a neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) resistance 
cassette in opposite orientation, a 1 Kb XbaI/EcoRV fragment located 0.15 Kb downstream of 
exon 3 (3’ homologous flank), and a thymidine kinase selection cassette. ES cells (129 SvEv 
background) were electroporated with the linearized targeting vector for Phd1 as described 3. 
Resistant clones were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting 
(Supplementary Figure 1) and PCR (not shown). Correctly recombined ES cell clones were 
aggregated with morula stage embryos. To obtain Phd1+/- germline offspring in a 50% Swiss / 
50% 129 background, chimeric male mice were intercrossed with wild-type Swiss females. 
Subsequently, heterozygous breeding pairs were established to generate homozygous Phd1-
/- progeny. Housing and all experimental animal procedures were approved by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee of the K.U. Leuven. 

KNOCKDOWN OF PHD1 OR PPAR(cid:0) IN MICE AND QUANTITATIVE REAL-TIME PCR 

shPhd1KD and shPpar(cid:0)KD DNA constructs were designed as described 
(www.invitrogen.com/rnai) to produce short hairpin interference RNA against Phd1 or Ppar(cid:0) 
in vivo. As controls, we used appropriate shPhd1CTR and shPpar(cid:0)CTR constructs, which 
differed from shPhd1KD and shPpar(cid:0)KD by a mismatch of 10 nucleotides in the sequence of 
Phd1 and Ppar(cid:0), respectively.  

For sequence information on shRNA oligonucleotides, forward and reverse primers 
and probes, labeled with fluorescent dye (FAM) and quencher (TAMRA), used for quantitative 
real-time PCR, please refer to Supplementary Table 1.  

MYOFIBER TYPING 

Transverse cryostat sections of hindlimb muscles were stained with primary 
monoclonal antibodies directed against fast myosin type IIA and slow myosin type I 
(Developmental studies Hybridoma Bank, IA, USA; dilution 1/20), and secondary antibodies 

23.10 .07 9:42 AM  

- 6 - 

Alexa Fluor 350 anti-mouse IgG1 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) and FITC-
anti-mouse (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, USA). Fiber size, capillary 
density and intercapillary distance were quantified on eight entire muscle sections (each 320 
µm apart).  

INDIRECT CALORIMETRY 

Oxygen consumption was simultaneously determined on ad libitum fed, group-housed 
animals (group A: n = 5 for each genotype, group B: n = 7 for each genotype, 12 weeks old, 
male and female mice) via indirect calorimetry by using an open-circuit calorimeter unit 4. 
Prior to the measurements the animals were allowed to acclimatize to the chambers for 2 
days; measurements were taken during 3 days (with respecting light and night cycles). All 
mice were weighed individually at the beginning and the end of the 3 days trial; oxygen 
consumption and carbon dioxide production measurements were taken at 15 min intervals for 
72 hours. The data generated represent the mean oxygen consumption per ml per gram per 
hour (expressed as O2 consumption: ml per hour per gram body weight). 

MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATION IN PERMEABILIZED MYOFIBERS 

Mitochondrial respiration was determined using high-resolution respirometry (Oroboros 
Oxygraph-2k), using the DatLab Software for data acquisition and analyses (Oroboros 
Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) 5,6. In detail, soleus muscle was dissected from animals and 
put immediately into BIOPS/relaxing solution (Ca2+/EGTA buffer (10 mM), free calcium (0.1 
µM), imidazole (20 mM), K+/4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) (50 mM), dithiothreitol 
(DTT; 0.5 mM), MgCl2 (6.56 mM), ATP (5.77 mM), phosphocreatine (15 mM), taurine (20 
mM), pH 7.1). Individual fiber bundles were separated with two pairs of sharp forceps, 
achieving a high degree of fiber separation. The fiber bundles were permeabilized for 30 min 
in 2 ml of ice-cold relaxing solution containing saponin (50 µg/ml). After rinsing in respiration 
medium (MiR05; Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria) containing sucrose (110 mM), potassium 
lactobionate (60 mM), EGTA (0.5 mM), MgCl2 (3 mM), taurine (20 mM), KH2PO4 (10 mM), 
HEPES (20 mM), sucrose (110 mM), BSA (1 g/l), pH 7.1, the muscle bundles were blotted 
and wet weight was measured on a balance controlled for constant relative humidity, so that 

23.10 .07 9:42 AM  

- 7 - 

all biopsy samples were hydrated to the same degree. The muscle bundles were then 
immediately transferred into Oxygraph-2k chambers containing respiration medium at 37°C in 
the O2 concentration range of 600 µM declining to 200 µM, thus preventing oxygen limitation 
of respiration 6. All measurements of respiration were made in quadruplicate, simultaneously. 
Resting respiration (state 2, absence of adenylates) was measured after the addition of 
malate (2 mM) and pyruvate (5 mM) as the complex I substrate supply, and then state 3 
respiration was assessed by the addition of ADP (2.5 mM). The integrity of the outer 
mitochondrial membrane was assessed by the addition of cytochrome c (10 µM); no 
stimulation of respiration was observed. Subsequent addition of glutamate (10 mM) and 
succinate (10 mM) provided state 3 respiration with convergent electron input to complexes I 
and II 7. The addition of rotenone (0.5 µM) resulted in inhibition of complex I for examination 
of O2 flux with complex II substrate alone, while atractyloside (50 mM) was added to inhibit 
ATP/ADP translocase, which allowed assessing resting respiration in the absence of 
phosphorylation. In separate experiments, the lack of compensatory activation of respiration 
by fatty acid oxidation was assessed by the addition of the short chain fatty acid octanoyl 
carnitine (10 mM) while electron input into complexes I and II was active. 

ASSESSMENT OF VASCULARIZATION 

For assessment of re-vascularization, bismuth gelatino-angiography was carried out, 
and arterioles branching directly from pre-existing collaterals, connecting the femoral and 
saphenous artery in the adductor region of the thigh, were quantified by morphometry as 
described on histological cross sections after 7 days 8. Side branches were categorized as 
second or third generation according to their luminal area (> 300 µm, < 300 µm, respectively). 
For micro-CT angiography, hindlimbs were perfused with a solution containing 30% barium 
sulfate and 5% gelatine, dissected in toto, and the crural vasculature was imaged using a 
high-resolution micro-CT imaging system (SkyScan-1172, Skyscan, Aartselaar, Belgium), 
with a voltage of 50 kVp and a current of 200 µA. Blood flow in non-operated and ligated 
limbs was measured applying 15 µm fluorescent microspheres (1 x 106 beads per ml, 
Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) after maximal vasodilation with sodium nitroprusside (50 
ng/ml, Sigma) as described 9,10.  

23.10 .07 9:42 AM

TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY 

Quantification was performed according to Weibel's standard stereologic principles for 
electron microscopy 11, with the aid of a 84-testline grid superimposed over each EM picture 
(length of short line segment = 0.25 µm; total length of test line = 21 µm). The volume fraction 
occupied by mitochondriae (Vmi) was determined as the number of test points lying on trans-
sections of mitochondria, divided by the number of total points on the test grid. In order to 
determine the collective surface area of mitochondrial cristae (Smc), we counted the number 
of intersections (Ni) between test lines and the surface contour of mitochondrial cristae. Smc 
was subsequently calculated as Ni per test line length, multiplied by 4. In addition, the cristae 
surface-to-mitochondrial volume ratio was calculated. 

NMR SPECTROSCOPY TO DETERMINE ATP CONTENT AND SUBSTRATE OXIDATION 

In vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy experiments on lower limbs were performed at 188 MHz 
in a Bruker Biospec (Karlsruhe, Germany), equipped with a horizontal 4.7 Tesla 
superconducting magnet, using a 10 mm diameter solenoid transmit-receive coil. Prior to the 
measurement, mice were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight 
Nembutal, Sanofi, Belgium). The hindlimbs were positioned directly inside the coil, and serial 
31P NMR spectra were acquired every 3 min during 2 h (30 degree pulse of 9 µs to reduce 
saturation effects, total repetition time (TR)=1.4 s, number of averages (NA)=128; no proton 
decoupling). The peak intensities of PCr, Pi and ATP resonances were quantified with the 
jMRUI software package. The pH was determined from frequency shift of the Pi versus PCr 
peak. Saturation factors were measured separately and peak amplitudes were corrected 
accordingly. For in vivo determination of glucose and fatty acid oxidation rates in the 
hindlimbs 13C-tracer labeled compounds (50 mg of [U-13C]-glucose and [U-13C]-fatty acids, 
respectively) were injected intravenously during 60 minutes. [U-13C]-fatty acids was delivered 
bound to 3% BSA. After perfusion, muscle samples were rapidly excised and immediately 
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Following homogenization in perchloric acid, precipitation of HClO4 
and pH adjustment (pH = 7.5 ± 0.5), samples were dried and resuspended in D2O prior to 
analysis. [1H]- 13CNMR analysis (pulse angle 45deg, TR = 2.5s, scan time = 18-48h, 1H-
decoupled, NOE enhanced) revealed the presence of [4,5-13C2]-glutamate, which is formed 

23.10 .07 9:42 AM  

- 9 - 

during oxidation of [U-13C]-glucose and [U-13C]-fatty acids in the TCA cycle, thus indicating 
the extent of [U-13C]-glucose- or [U-13C]-fatty acid oxidation. Resonances of newly formed [3,-
13C1]- and [3,4,5-13C3]- glutamate were not reliably detectable, we measured the area under 
the curve (AUC) of the de novo formed [4,5-13C2]-glutamate NMR peaks, which were 
corrected for the total creatine (creatine and phophocreatine) peaks intensities (similar results 
were obtained when normalizing to taurine). Peak intensities of lactate, succinate, glutamate 
and total creatine were quantified by integration after baseline correction, using the 
spectrometer processing software. 

DETERMINATION OF GLYCOGEN 

Muscle glycogen was measured based on the hexokinase method after acid hydrolysis 

12. 

ASSESSMENT OF MUCSLE NECROSIS 

Microscopic analysis of crural muscle section was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 
imaging microscope, equipped with an Axiocam HrC camera and KS300 morphometry 
software (Zeiss). The cross-sectional areas of viable and necrotic zones were quantified on 
eight entire sections (each 320 µm apart) of the crural muscles. Necrotic muscle area was 
expressed in absolute mm2, as no significant genotypic differences were observed in the total 
muscle area. For all experiments, except the electroporation studies, the necrotic muscle area 
was measured in all crural muscles (gastrocnemius, plantaris and soleus). For the PHD 
knockdown, the necrotic muscle area was measured in the plantaris muscle, as this muscle 
expressed most of the shRNA constructs (as evidenced after electroporation of a GFP 
expressing construct) without exhibiting any signs of cellular damage due 
to 
the 
electroporation alone. 

MYOGLOBIN DETERMINATION 

Skeletal muscle myoglobin content was determined using a sensitive ELISA for murine 
myoglobin. Therefore samples were prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic 
Extraction Kit (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) and the ELISA was carried out 

23.10 .07 9:42 AM  

- 10 - 

according to the manufacturers instructions (Life Diagnostics Inc., West Chester, PA). In 
addition, concentrations of active myoglobin in murine muscle samples were assessed by a 
peroxidase-based activity assay as previously described 2. 
In brief, samples were 
homogenized in a solution (0.25–0.5 ml/mg dry weight) containing 80 mM KCl and 50 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, on ice for 1.5–2 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 x g for 10 
min at 4°C and 200 µl supernatant was added to the reaction medium. The reaction medium 
consisted of 760 µl water, 40 µl ethanol containing 50 mM ortho-tolidine (Sigma; St Louis, 
MO), and 200 µl of 1 M tertiary-butyl-hydroperoxide (Sigma). After 60 min of incubation at 
room temperature (22–25°C) the absorbance was determined at 436 nm. Equine myoglobin 
(>99% purity; Sigma), dissolved in the homogenization buffer, was used as a standard. 

MEASUREMENT OF GLUTATHIONE 

Gastrocnemius samples were homogenized in 5% metaphosphorous buffer containing 
1mM DETPA. Tissues were glass-to-glass homogenized at 0°C, centrifuged (10 min; 4°C) 
and the supernatant used to measure total and oxidized glutathione. 100 µl of buffer was 
used per 10 mg of tissue. For total glutathione, 10 µl of supernatant as well as blank and 
standard curves (0.25-10 nmoles) were incubated with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) 
(DTNB). DNTB reacts with G-SH to generate GS-SG and 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB; 
peak absorbance at 420 nm); the GS-SG formed as well as oxidized present in the samples 
are back-reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase coupled to NADPH oxidation. In this 
cycling assay, concentrations of the reactants are chosen so that the rate of color formation is 
linear with time, with the slope of the line (absorbance/time (min); A/t (min)) being directly 
proportional to the concentration of total glutathione (GSH + GS-SG; GSt). Assay mixtures 
contained: 10 µl of supernatant, 1100 µl of phosphate buffer (KH2P04, pH7 + 1 mM EDTA), 20 
µl DNTB, 50 µl daily-prepared NADPH (1 mg/ml), and 1 unit of glutathione reductase. 
Oxidized glutathione was measured similarly except that reduced glutathione was masked by 
incubation with N-ethyl maleimide (NEM). Assay mixtures contained: 100 µl of supernatant, 
50 µl of metaphosphorous buffer, 300 µl NEM, 20 mM and 100 µl of 1:1 solution KOH/MOPS 
buffer (pH 7). NEM-derivatized reduced glutathione was excluded by exposure of whole 
samples to C18 cartridges (Bond Elut C18, 500mg; Varian Benelux, Sint-Katelijne-Waver, 
Belgium). Oxidized glutathione was eluted from the column in 1950 µl and the 100 µl was 

23.10 .07 9:42 AM  

- 11 - 

assayed as above using DNTB derivation.  

PDC ACTIVITY DETERMINATION, MITOCHONDRIAL ENZYMATIC ASSAYS AND MUSCLE METABOLITES  

Assays for determination of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC), aconitase, 
citrate synthasea and succinate dehydrogenase activity were performed as described 13,14. 
Metabolites were measured in HClO4 extracts of liver by enzymatic methods 15. 

MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATION MEASUREMENTS IN ISCHEMIC LIMBS  

Mitochondria were isolated from ischemic limbs 6 hours after vascular ligation. For 
each experiment, crural muscles from 6 limbs were pooled in order to obtain a sufficient 
sample size. After fat and connective tissue removal, muscles were minced and homogenized 
in an ice-cold medium containing 100 mM sucrose, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM K2HPO4, 0.1 mM 
EGTA, 0.2% BSA, and 50 mM Tris-Hcl, pH7.4 as previously described 16,17. Respiration of 
skeletal muscle mitochondria was measured using a Clark type electrode with 10 mM 
succinate (plus 5 µM rotenone) as an oxidizable substrate in 1.2 ml of an air saturated 
incubation medium. State 3 respiration was measured by an ADP pulse method after ADP 
was added in limiting amounts (180 µM). 

FENOFIBRATE TREATMENT 

To assess the muscle protective effect of the PPAR(cid:0) agonist fenofibrate, wild-type 
mice received fenofibrate (15mg/day; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) by gavage, or 
vehicle alone for ten days prior to femoral artery ligation. Tissue necrosis was subsequently 
analyzed on histological sections of the crural muscles as outline above; and mRNA 
expression of putative Ppar (cid:0) target genes analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in muscles from 
healthy limbs. In accordance with previous reports 18,19, the fenofibrate dosage used for this 
experiment did not induce toxic side effects, or weight reduction.

Supplementary Figure 1: Generation of Phd1 deficient mice
a, Targeting strategy for inactivation of the Phd1 locus. Top: Wild-type Phd1
allele, indicating the relative position of exons 1 to 5 (dark boxes in genomic
structure). Middle: Outline of
the targeting vector specifying the genomic
sequences used as 5’ and 3’ homology flanks, cloned at both sides of a
neomycine resistance (neo) cassette. A thymidine kinase (TK) gene outside the
flanking homologies allowed for negative selection against random integration
events. Bottom: Replacement of exon 2 and 3 by the neo cassette after
homologous recombination. Diagnostic restriction fragments are indicated with
their relative size by the thin lines under or above the alleles. Inset, Southern blot
analysis of genomic DNA from recombinant ES cells, digested with HindIII and
hybridized with 3’ external probe. The 8.2 kb and 9.6 kb genomic fragments
correspond to wt and Phd1null alleles, respectively. Location of HindIII sites
and probe are indicated in (a); wt, wild-type .
