Metastasis is a multistep process that involves local tumour invasion followed by dissemination to, and re-establish-
ment at, distant sites. Here we show that during multistage tumorigenesis, discrete expression thresholds of activat-
ed Smad2 and H-ras are sequentially surpassed, driving tumour progression through distinct phases from a differen-
tiated squamous carcinoma to a motile invasive stage, followed by an overt change from epithelial to mesenchymal
cell type, finally culminating in metastatic tumour spread. Smad2 activation alone induces migration of tumour cells.
Elevated H-ras levels, however, are required for nuclear accumulation of Smad2, both of which are essential for the
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Having undergone EMT, fibroblastoid carcinoma cells with elevated levels of
activated Smad2, gain the capability to spread to a wide variety of tissues by a further increase in Smad2 expression.
These findings have far-reaching implications for the prevention of tumour growth, invasion and metastasis.

Cancer development and metastasis is a multistep process that
involves local tumour growth and invasion followed by dis-
semination to, and re-establishment at, distant sites. The abil-
ity of a tumour to metastasize is the major determinant of cancer-
patient mortality. Elucidating the molecular pathways essential for
tumour metastasis is, therefore, a high priority in cancer biology, as
well as for small-molecule drug design.
Transforming growth factor β
(TGFβ ) has been implicated in
both tumour suppression and progression1. Although TGF β
inhibits growth of early carcinomas2,3, later in tumorigenesis, and
in co-operation with Ras, it can induce an epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT) towards an invasive, metastatic tumour pheno-
type3–8 . The mechanisms by which TGF β
can act both to promote
and inhibit tumour progression have been extensively studied but
remain unclear. Many studies have suggested that TGF β promotes
EMT5,6,8–11. But most of these studies have focused on one particu-
lar aspect of tumour invasion rather than complete transformation
to a mesenchymal cell type. These include increased cell motility,
characterized by changes in the actin cytoskeleton and adoption of
an invasive phenotype. Ultimately, these cells undergo a fate change
from an epithelial-like cell state that expresses multiple markers of
epithelial origin, towards a fibroblastic cell type that shows drastic
alterations in the cytoskeleton and cell-membrane components. In
particular cell types, features resembling an EMT can be induced by
TGFβ
alone4,5, by Ras–Raf signalling12, or cooperatively by both
pathways6. Several mechanisms of cooperation between Ras and
TGFβ
 have been proposed, including prevention of TGF β -induced
apoptosis by Raf13 or phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)
activation14, repression of TGF β –Smad signalling by oncogenic
Ras15, or a requirement for Raf mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signalling leading to the upregulation of TGF β
required
for an EMT12. Interestingly, the same signalling pathways are
involved in inducing a cell fate change to the mesoderm lineage
during Xenopus development16–20.
The relevance of these biological changes to in vivo models of
multistage tumour progression has not been adequately investigat-
ed. We have exploited a series of well-characterized tumour cell lines
derived from sequential stages of mouse skin carcinogenesis21,22 to

study the significance of changes in threshold levels of H-ras and
TGFβ
activation during progression to the metastatic phenotype.
Early-stage mouse skin papillomas induced by successive treatment
with initiators and promoters of carcinogenesis can progress to
form squamous carcinomas and subsequently to undifferentiated
spindle-cell tumours that resemble fibrosarcomas. These tumours
are initiated by activating mutations in the Hras1 gene, which
undergoes a series of increases in gene copy number and/or expres-
sion during tumour progression21. We have used clonally related
squamous and spindle cells derived from the same primary tumour
to demonstrate that increases in the threshold levels of activated
Smad2 and H-ras drive tumour progression from a differentiated
squamous carcinoma to a motile invasive stage, through overt EMT,
culminating in excess Smad2-dependent metastatic tumour spread.
Activation and nuclear accumulation of Smad2 observed in spindle
cell lines is also seen during tumour progression of chemically
induced mouse skin tumours to the spindle phenotype in vivo,
demonstrating the relevance of these observations to the process of
tumour invasion and metastasis in vivo.

Results

Endogenous TGFβ
signalling is activated in spindle tumour cells.
We investigated the functions of TGF β
signalling in EMT during
tumour invasion and metastasis using a well-characterized series of
cell lines derived from murine keratinocytes and primary skin
tumours that are representative of various stages of tumour pro-
gression (Fig. 1a). In particular, the squamous carcinoma cell clone
B9 was isolated from the same primary tumour as the two spindle
clones, A5 and D3. The common clonal origin of the three cell lines
is demonstrated by identical mutations in Hras1 and Trp53 genes22.
These matched cell lines thus enabled us to investigate the mecha-
nism of a conversion to a spindle phenotype: increased motility, the
switch to the invasive phenotype and the onset of metastasis.
In cells derived from benign tumours and squamous carcinoma
cells, both the basal and TGF β -induced transcriptional activity of a
TGF β -responsive plasminogen activator 
inhibitor 
type 1
(PAI1)–luciferase gene reporter construct23 was relatively low. In

contrast, transcriptional activity of the reporter in the spindle cell
clones was dramatically increased, both in the presence and absence
of exogenous TGF β
(Fig. 1b). These results suggested that endoge-
nous TGFβ
signalling is activated in spindle cell lines.
In the panel of murine carcinomas, spindle tumours secreted

significant amounts of TGF β
, whereas squamous carcinoma cells
did not secrete detectable levels of TGF β
(Fig. 1c). Transfection of
a dominant-negative TGFβ
receptor, T β RIIK187R, or applying TGFβ
neutralizing antibodies, reduced the activity of the PAI1–luciferase
reporter (Fig. 1d), suggesting that activation of the endogenous

TGFβ
signalling pathway in spindle tumours (Fig. 1b) was due, in
part at least, to autocrine stimulation by TGFβ
.
TGFβ
stimulates phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of
the transcription factors Smad2 and Smad3 (ref. 24). Smad2 is
expressed throughout skin tumour progression (Fig. 1e), in con-
trast to Smad3, which is expressed at comparatively low levels
(Fig . 1e and data not shown). To fur ther character ize the
TGFβ –Smad signalling pathway we examined Smad2 phosphoryla-
tion and nuclear-localization status before and after stimulation
with TGFβ
. By both criteria, there was evidence that Smad2 is con-
stitutively activated in invasive spindle tumour cells (Fig. 1e,f ).
Activation of Smad2 alone stimulates cell migration, but not EMT.
Retroviral transduction of Smad2dom.act. (Fig. 1g,h) into B9 squa-
mous carcinoma cells resulted in cell migration (Fig. 2a,b), and
inhibited cell-cycle progression (data not shown). In contrast,
expression of Smad2dom.neg. (Fig. 1g,h) inhibited cell migration even
in the presence of TGF β
(data not shown). Although Smad2dom.act
induced a dramatic relocalization of E-cadherin from the adherens
junctions to the cytoplasmic pool (Fig. 2c,d), similar to squamous
carcinoma cells treated with TGF β
(ref. 8 and data not shown), no
changes in the absolute levels of cytokeratins, vimentin or E-cad-
herin were detected in either Smad2dom.neg .- (not shown) or
Smad2dom.act.-transduced cells (Fig. 3a). TGF β
and Smad2 were,

therefore, not sufficient to induce a complete EMT of squamous
carcinoma cells.
Mutant H-ras must co-operate with activated Smad2 to induce an
EMT. The mutant Hras1 allele present in the squamous B9 cells is
amplified and over-expressed in the A5 and D3 spindle cell lines —
the same is true of almost all spindle tumours21 (S. Frame, R.
Crombie and A. B., unpublished observations). We asked if over-
expression of mutant H-ras could cooperate with upregulation of
TGFβ
signalling to induce EMT in B9 squamous carcinoma cells.
Overexpression of mutant H-ras in squamous tumour cells stimu-
lated TGF β -induced transcription (Fig. 2k). In squamous carcino-
ma cells, stimulation with TGF β
induces carboxy-terminal phos-
phorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 2j) and its accumulation in the nucleus
(Fig. 2f,g). Overexpression of mutant H-ras also induced nuclear
accumulation of phosphorylated Smad2 without significantly
increasing the C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2 itself (Fig.
2h,j). Overexpression of mutant H-ras alone did not induce
changes in cell shape or in the expression of intermediate filaments
that indicate an EMT (Figs 2e and 3a). Strikingly, co-expression of
mutant H-ras and Smad2dom.act. induced the cells to adopt a spindle-
cell morphology (Fig. 2i). At the same time, epithelial intermediate
filaments were replaced by mesenchymal filaments, such as
vimentin (Fig. 3a). There was also de novo expression of α -smooth

muscle actin, a specialized mesenchymal marker. Interestingly,
Smad3dom.act. also cooperated with H-ras to induce EMT (Fig. 3b).
But there EMT could not be induced by either Smad3dom.act. alone,
or by co-expression of H-ras with wild-type Smad2, Smad3 or
Smad4 (Fig. 3b). An increase in the dosage of the mutant Hras1
allele, together with the upregulation of TGFβ
and Smad2 or
Smad3 signalling, is therefore sufficient to induce overt EMT in
squamous tumour cells that can’t be induced to undergo EMT by
TGFβ alone8.
Activated Smad2 is essential to maintain the spindle phenotype.
We next investigated whether Smad signalling is essential for main-
tenance of the invasive spindle-cell phenotype. Expression of
Smad2dom.neg. in invasive spindle cells caused a dramatic reversion to
a more cuboidal, epithelial phenotype (compare Fig. 4a,b) and
the TGF β -responsive promoter
inhibition of
the activ ity of
(Fig. 1h). TGF β
and Smad2 or Smad3 are known to induce cell-
cycle arrest in epithelial cells25,26. Accordingly, inhibiting aberrant
TGFβ
signalling by Smad2dom.neg. expression relieved this checkpoint
and restored cell-cycle progression (Fig . 4d).
Impor tantly,
Smad2dom.neg. expression restored many of the features of a basic
epithelial gene-expression profile in the spindle cells, such as the re-
expression of E-cadherin, α 2 and α 5 integrins and cytokeratin 18,
and simultaneously reduced the expression of the mesenchymal fil-
ament proteins, vimentin and α -smooth muscle actin (Fig. 4f ).
Spindle cells transfected with the Smad2dom.act. had elevated TGF β
reporter gene activity (Fig.1h) and continued to display a mes-
enchymal spindle-cell morphology (Fig. 4c) and gene-expression
profile (Fig. 4f ). We thus conclude that both the induction and
reversal of spindle carcinoma formation can be accomplished by
manipulating Smad2 signalling.

Smad2 activation promotes tumour invasion in vivo. Squamous
cells, derived by infecting spindle tumour cells with Smad2dom.neg.,
lost the invasive capacity characteristic of the parental cell line
when tested for invasion in collagen matr ices (Fig . 4g ,h).
Furthermore, surface expression of α vβ 3 integrin, which has been
associated with the invasive migratory phenotype of tumour cells27,
was completely lost in these Smad2dom.neg.-reverted populations
(Fig. 4e,f ). In contrast, expression of Smad2dom.act. enhanced the
invasiveness of the parental spindle cell (Fig. 4g,i).
The parental spindle-cell population or its Smad2-transfected
derivatives were injected intraperitoneally or subcutaneously into
athymic mice. Squamous cells expressing Smad2dom.neg. lost the abil-
ity to form tumours compared with the parental or Smad2dom.act.
spindle lines, and formed only small cellular nodules at the injec-
tion site or on the mesenteric surfaces (data not shown). In con-
trast, both the parental spindle cells and the population expressing
Smad2dom.act. formed tumours at both locations. The primary sub-
cutaneous tumours produced from Smad2dom.act.-transduced cells,
although significantly smaller than those from parental control
cells, were far more invasive, readily penetrating the overlying skin
and underlying muscle fascia (Fig. 5a,b, and data not shown).
High levels of activated Smad2 drive tumour extravasation and
metastasis. The skin-derived mouse spindle tumour cells used in
this experiment are capable of forming lung metastases after intra-
venous injection, but at exceedingly low frequency. The control
spindle cell population caused no macroscopic metastases six
weeks after intravenous injection of 1 × 106 cells into athymic mice
(Fig. 5c,e). In contrast, cells expressing Smad2dom.act. formed a high
number of perivascular metastatic deposits in the lungs of recipient
animals (Fig. 5d,f ). The observed gain of metastatic capacity of
Smad2dom.act.-expressing tumour cells could result from increased
extravasation into the lung tissue, or from an increased capacity to
establish progressively growing nodules after tissue dissemination.
We therefore analysed the mechanism of this metastatic switch by
investigating the kinetics of dissemination of tumour cells to the
lung. Parental and Smad2dom.act.-expressing tumour cells could both
still be detected at the subcutaneous injection site several days after
injection (Fig. 5g). But after intravenous injection, only cells
expressing Smad2dom.act. were found in the lung (Fig. 5h). Moreover,
these metastasizing cells were seen in the lung as early as 20 min-
utes after injection. We conclude that additional expression of
Smad2 in already invasive cells accomplishes a second critical step
in metastasis, namely, extravasation into the target tissue.
High levels of Smad2 and phosphorylated Smad2 located in the
cytoplasm of tumour cells have been found in human breast-
tumour samples28. To analyse whether endogenous Smad2 hyper-
activation and nuclear accumulation occurs during normal tumour
progression, we analysed primary tumour material from chemical-
ly induced mouse skin tumours, for the status of Smad2 activation
(Fig. 6). In all differentiated tumours and squamous carcinomas,
phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad2 total protein was predominant-
ly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6a,b). Target genes such as
Smad7 were not induced (Fig. 6c). In the spindle tumour cells,
however, phosphorylated Smad2 was predominantly nuclear
(Fig. 6d,e) and Smad7 was strongly induced (Fig. 6f ).

Discussion

Our data support a multistep model for tumour progression and
metastasis that involves a progressive increase in the threshold lev-
els of H-ras and Smad2 activity. Duplication, or in some cases
amplification, of mutant Hras1 has been observed in mouse and
human tumours (reviewed in refs 29,30). TGFβ 1 is frequently over-
expressed in human tumours31 and its expression is associated with
poor prognosis32,33. H-ras has been reported to antagonize growth
inhibition and apoptosis induction by TGFβ
, as well as certain
aspects of Smad2-mediated transcription6,12,13,15. In a cell-culture
model for EMT, Ras-induced PI(3)K activity rescues cells from

TGFβ -induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, whereas Raf kinase
activation is necessary for EMT induction14. Our results provide a
new view of Ras and Smad cooperating to promote tumour devel-
opment by demonstrating that H-ras induces nuclear accumula-
tion of phosphorylated Smad2 and consequent upregulation of
Smad2-mediated transcription. Preliminary analysis of gene-
expression patterns in the cell lines described here, using comple-
mentary DNA microarrays, have shown, for example, that elevated
TGF β
signalling in spindle cells continues to be reflected in
increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax and Bad,
and that expression of these genes is downregulated by introducing
the dominant-negative Smad 2 construct (data not shown). The lack
of overt apoptosis in spindle cells may, therefore, result from con-
comitant upregulation of survival signals induced by the elevated
H-ras levels in the same cells, which is consistent with one model of
cooperation14. We have previously proposed that sequential increas-
es in H-ras levels during tumour progression may be required to
activate different effector pathways to provide the necessary survival
signals at later stages of tumourigenesis29. Interestingly, spindle
tumour cells are more sensitive than corresponding squamous cells
to apoptosis being induced by PI(3)K inhibitors (S. Frame and A. B.,
unpublished observations), consistent with the possibility that

PI(3)K activation occurs at the higher threshold level of H-ras sig-
nalling and is required for survival of spindle cells that overproduce
TGFβ
. The coordinate upregulation of both Ras and TGFβ
can be
seen as a mechanism that allows the tumour cell to adopt the cell-
fate change and invasive properties required for progression without
dying as a consequence of increased levels of pro-apoptotic signals.
The majority of genes whose expression increases dramatically
during EMT are regulated cooperatively by Smad2 and H-ras,
whereas there is only a small number of H-ras-induced genes that
are repressed by TGF β
(M.O., unpublished observations). Taken
together, the changes in gene-expression patterns indicate that both
mechanisms — co-operativity of H-ras and Smad2 on certain pro-
moters and antagonism on others — are functional during H-ras-
and TGFβ -driven tumour progression.
Interestingly, spindle tumour cells that express higher levels of
TGFβ 1 target genes proliferate more slowly in vitro than their
derivatives in which TGFβ
signalling is blocked. Nevertheless, the
former show enhanced tumour formation in vivo. These findings
suggest that selective pressure for tumour outgrowth favours acqui-
sition of invasive properties over increased cell-cycle progression.
These results provide a fascinating parallel with developmental
systems, where both threshold levels of Ras16 or MAPK17 activity

together with threshold levels of the TGFβ
family members, activin
and nodal18,34, control cell-fate decisions during Xenopus mesoderm
induction. Both activin or nodal receptors and TGFβ
receptors
activate Smad2 (ref. 35), and Smad2 is required for mesoderm
induction in mice20 and is sufficient to induce mesoderm in ecto-
dermal explants in Xenopus19. Moreover, whereas low levels of
Smad2 can induce lateral mesoderm in Xenopus, higher doses are
required to induce dorsal mesoderm19. Similar to the changing

threshold levels of Smad2 activity that regulate developmental
processes, during tumour progression intermediate levels of Smad2
cooperate with mutant H-ras to induce spindle-cell transformation
(EMT) and invasiveness of tumour cells. But even higher levels of
Smad2 activity need to be surpassed to facilitate a high frequency of
metastasis, caused by increased penetration through blood-vessel
walls and dissemination into the target tissue.
We propose that differing threshold levels of Smad2 and Ras

metastasis, and suggest that this pathway will provide important
targets for drug discovery, which should lead to new possibilities for
the control of tumour spread.

Methods

Cell culture and retroviral infections

The previously well-characterized cell lines C5N, PDV, B9, E4, H11, A5 and D3, which represent differ-
ent stages of mouse skin tumorigenesis, were used in this study. Note that B9, A5 and D3 were isolated
from the same tumour and are clonally related22, as indicated by connecting lines in Fig. 1a. Tumour
cell lines were grown in DMEM, containing 10% foetal calf serum (FCS).
Activating or inactivating mutants of Smad2 and Smad3 were generated by site-directed mutagene-
sis. The serine phosphorylation sites (SSMS, using single-letter amino acid code) at the C-terminus of
Smad2 were mutated to acidic residues (EDME) to generate a constitutively activate molecule,
Smad2dom.act. or to alanine residues that prevent phosphorylation and generate a dominant-negative
molecule, Smad2dom.neg. (ref. 24; Fig. 1e,f and data not shown).
Parental cells were transduced with supernatants from BOSC23 high-titre retrovirus-producing
cells expressing the respective Smad2 mutants or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a control, as pre-
viously described by us7. Non-clonal populations were selected by culture in G418 media or by cell
sorting using GFP. For co-expression experiments all recombinant plasmids were simultaneously
transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), followed by high G418 drug selec-
tion. Expression levels from exogenous constructs were verified by western-blot analyses. Cell culture,
collagen-invasion assays, western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed as described pre-
viously7. All transduction experiments with the Smad mutant constructs were performed with either
B9 (representative of a squamous cell line) or D3, H11 or A5 (representative of spindle cell lines). PAI-1

reporter assays were performed essentially as described after transient transfection of the cell lines6,23.
Results were normalized for transfection efficiency by co-transfection and assay of a cytomegalovirus
promoter (CMV)- β -galactosidase reporter. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated
at least twice.

Antibodies

Antibodies used for western blot, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunofluorescence
analysis were: keratins (CRP, Denver, CO; Sigma, St Louis, MO), vimentin (Sigma), α -smooth muscle
actin (Sigma), integrins (Transduction, Lexington, KY), Smad2 and Smad3 (Transduction; Santa Cruz,
Santa Cruz, CA), Smad7 (Santa Cruz) and epitope tags (CRP). TGFβ neutralizing antibody (R & D,
Minneapolis, MN) and human Tβ RII-Fc chimera (R & D), were used up to 50 ng ml − 1 in culture
medium.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Cells were washed thoroughly in PBS, and cultured in DMEM without serum for 16 h. The medium
was harvested and assayed for total TGF β activity after acid-activation, using the Quantikine TM ELISA
kit (R & D).

Animal experiments

All cell injections were performed using female Balb/c nu/nu athymic mice. In general 1 × 106 cells
were injected. Animals were killed when the tumours reached 1 cm in diameter, or if the mice showed
signs of physical stress, or at the end of the observation period. All animal experiments were per-
formed in triplicate and repeated at least twice.

Chemical carcinogenesis

Mice (NIH/Swiss, 8 week-old females) received a single topical dose of 7,12-dimethyl benzanthracene
(DMBA; 25 µ g per mouse in 200 µ
l acetone) and, starting one week after initiation, animals were pro-
moted by topical application with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA; 200 µ
l of 10 − 4 M solu-
tion in acetone) twice weekly for 20 weeks. Tumours were allowed to progress to the carcinoma stage,
diagnosed initially according to clinical criteria and thereafter the diagnosis was confirmed by histolog-
ical analysis and the tumour grade determined. All tumours were snap frozen and frozen-fixed sections
were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis.

Metastasis assays

Cells were fluorescently labelled by incubating them with the lipophilic dyes Sp-DiOC18(3) (green) or
Sp-DiIC18(3) (orange) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 2 pg ml− 1 for 24 h. Residual dyes were
washed away with PBS. Within 4 h of labelling, 1 × 106 cells were injected either intravenously or sub-
cutaneously into mice. The lungs and skins of ten mice at each of two time points (20 min and 24 h)
were harvested, and unstained cryo-sections were simultaneously analysed for green and orange fluo-
rescent cells.
