D-alanine-D-lactate ligase from Enterococcus faecium BM4147 is
directly responsible for the biosynthesis of alternate cell-wall
precursors in bacteria, which are resistant to the glycopeptide
antibiotic vancomycin. The crystal structure has been determined
with data extending to 2.5-Å resolution. This structure shows that
the active site has unexpected interactions and is distinct from
previous models for D-alanyl-D-lactate ligase mechanistic studies. It
appears that the preference of the enzyme for lactate as a ligand
over D-alanine could be mediated by electrostatic effects andyor a
hydrogen-bonding network, which principally involve His-244. The
structure of D-alanyl-D-lactate ligase provides a revised interpre-
tation of the molecular events that lead to vancomycin resistance.

R esistance to commonly used antibiotics is a major clin ical
problem. The treatment of life-threaten ing Gram-positive
infections, such as those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphy-
lococcus aureus (MRSA), for example, depends at present on
treatment w ith antibiotics such as vancomycin and teicoplan in.
Vancomycin is now the last line of defense against MRSA and
many other multiple-antibiotic-resistant infections. It targets the
peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria by selectively
binding the D-alan ine-D-alan ine (D-A la) termin i of peptidogly-
can precursors and preventing their cross link ing to adjacent
strands. This sign ificantly weakens the structural integrity of the
cell wall and leads to osmotic lysis. Recently, however, strains of
Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of sepsis and
men ingitis, have become tolerant to vancomycin (1). Because the
more common high-level forms of vancomycin resistance are
associated w ith five genes encoded by mobile genetic elements
(2), there is a real probability that this resistance mechan ism
could well be acquired by other v irulent life-threaten ing infec-
tious agents such as MRSA. The clin ical isolates resistant to
vancomycin are characterized by a subtle change in the structure
of peptidoglycan termin i, as a result of the action of D-alanyl-D-X
ligases, which have dual-subsite specificity at their second amino
acid-binding site. The sw itch from D-A la-D-A la peptidoglycan
termin i to D-alan ine-D-lactate (D-A la-D-Lac) results in the loss
of crucial hydrogen-bonding interactions, causing a 1,000-fold
reduction of vancomycin-binding af fin ity.
Inducible high-level vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus
faecium BM4147 is associated w ith the five genes located on the
transposable element Tn1546 and is the most common clin ical
phenotype (2). A two-component transcriptional-activation sys-
tem of VanS and VanR controls the induction of three structural
genes VanH, VanA, and VanX. VanH is an a-keto acid reduc-
tase that converts py ruvate to D-Lac for D-A la-D-Lac synthesis
by the AT P-dependent desipeptide ligase, VanA (3). VanA is a
38.5-kDa protein capable of utilizing both hydrox yl acids and
D-A la as substrates w ith a concomitant sw itch from ester to
peptide bond formation dependent on pH (4). The presence of
any peptidoglycan chains ending in D-A la-D-A la, as a conse-
quence of endogenous peptidoglycan biosynthesis genes, is ne-
gated by the action of VanX, a Zn21-dependent D-A la-D-A la

dipeptidase (5). Thus the action of these three genes in concert
ensures the production of D-A la-D-Lac-terminating peptidogly-
can chains, which are bound ver y weakly by the glycopeptide
antibiotic vancomycin, rendering the bacteria resistant.
The first step in defin ing the structural and biochemical basis
of vancomycin resistance was the determination of the structure
of the enzyme [D-A la-D-A la ligase (DdlB), from Escher ichia coli]
that synthesizes the D-A la-D-A la moiety incorporated into the
normal vancomycin-susceptible cell walls (6). The sequence of
VanA and DdlB exhibits ’40% identity, and their overall folds
are ver y similar. The enzymes have similar functions in the
biosynthesis of peptidoglycan termin i in bacteria, but the capac-
ity of VanA to form D-A la-D-Lac has a direct correlation w ith
enterococcal resistance to vancomycin. In this paper, we report
the cr ystal structure of VanA complexed w ith a substrate
inhibitor (7) and define the residues involved in substrate binding
that are crucial to the resistance mechan ism.

Materials and Methods
Purification and Crystallization. The purification and cr ystallization
of the enzyme have been described in detail elsewhere (8).
Brief ly, the enzyme was cr ystallized by the hanging-drop-vapor
dif fusion method in the presence of a phosphinate inhibitor
analogue of D-A la-D-A la between 40% and 45% ammon ium
sulfate, 0.1 M Mops, pH 6.0, w ith cr ystals reaching dimensions
of 0.4 3 0.2 3 0.1 mm. A native dataset to 2.5 Å resolution was
collected and the space group determined as C2221 w ith cell
dimensions of a 5 123.2 Å, b 5 225 Å, and c 5 72.4 Å, w ith a
single dimer in the asymmetric un it. Data were collected w ith an
oscillation range of 1° per image by using a Cu-Ka radiation
source and a MAR345 image plate dev ice. Cr ystals were soaked
in mother liquor contain ing a glycerol concentration of 35% as
cr yoprotectant before f lash v itrification in a stream of N2 gas at
120 K. The data were processed and reduced by using the HKL
suite of programs (9).

Structure Determination and Refinement. Numerous attempts to

solve the structure of VanA by molecular replacement by using
a variety of programs had proved unsuccessful until recent
in-house developments in the molecular replacement program
MOLREP (10) became available. A solution was obtained by using

a search model (11), enabling the position of the VanA dimer
w ithin the asymmetric un it to be determined. Before refinement,
5% of the data were randomly f lagged for cross-validation
analysis (12). Rigid-body refinement as implemented in the
program REFMAC (13) was per formed on a polyalan ine model of
the structure solution div ided into three domains. Refinement
was carried out starting from 6 Å resolution w ith gradual
increments in resolution to 2.5 Å. Indiv idual atomic parameters
were refined by using REFMAC. With noncr ystallographic re-
straints, Rcr yst and Rfree values were reduced to 46% and 50%,
respectively. In itial phases were derived from these coordinates
by the program CAD (14) and improved by averaging, solvent
f latten ing, and histogram matching in the program DM (15), by
using a figure of merit calculated in REFMAC. Rebuilding from
this in itial model was carried out by using the X-AUTOFIT routine
implemented in the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations,
San Diego, CA). Af ter several cycles of rebuilding and refine-
ment, the density-modified maps were of suf ficient quality to
allow the modeling of residues 2–342, one AT P molecule and
one phosphinate transition state inhibitor per molecule. In
addition, a total of 397 waters, 3 sulfate ions, and 21 glycerol
molecules were modeled and included in refinement. The elec-
tron density associated w ith the glycerol molecules was larger
than that for a typical water and had a shape consistent w ith the
branched structure of glycerol. In many cases, the density
suggested that the glycerols were in more than one arrangement.
Generally, the atoms refined w ith ver y high B-factors, similar to
the mobile water molecules. It was decided at this stage not to

tr y to interpret these complex peaks in more detail either as
water or glycerol. The concentration of glycerol in the mother
liquor was 35%. Final refinement converged to an Rcr yst value of
0.205 and an Rfree value of 0.284 for data in the range of 15–2.5 Å.

Results and Discussion

Structure of VanA in Complex with ADP and Phosphinate Inhibitor.

The tertiar y structure of VanA in complex w ith ADP and a
phosphor ylated phosphinate inhibitor, an analogue of the tran-
sition-state species (7), is shown in Fig. 1a. The cr ystal structure
is well defined, w ith the electron-density maps continuous from
residues 2 to 342, the penultimate residue at the C terminus. The
structure has been refined w ith data extending to 2.5 Å; statis-
tical data for the final model are presented in Table 1. The
side-chain density for the two terminal residues is insuf ficient to
model side-chain atoms accurately, and these terminal residues
have been assigned as alan ine in our model. The enzyme’s
structure can be div ided into three domains w ith the nucleotide-
and substrate-binding sites formed predominantly between the
central and C-terminal domains; it has the characteristics of the
AT P-dependent carbox ylate –amineythiol
ligase super family
(16 –19). The N-terminal domain runs from A la-2 to Gly-121 and
has an ayb structure contain ing two a-helices and eight
b-strands. A loop extending from the ends of two of these strands
supports Glu-16, which is involved in substrate binding at the first
subsite and two residues, Val-19 and His-99, which are involved
in stabilizing the carbox yl an ion of the transition-state interme-
diate seen in the structure. Additionally,
in the N-terminal
domain there is unambiguous density for a disulphide bridge

formed between cysteines 52 and 64, which is not present in
DdlB. This disulphide bond was unexpected; VanA is a bacterial
intracellular enzyme and therefore is normally in a reducing
env ironment. However, the position ing of this disulphide bridge
is interesting in that it links two adjacent b-strands at the base
of a short loop. It is likely that formation of this disulphide bond
may have aided in the cr ystallization of VanA, as this disulphide-
stabilized loop makes some cr ystal contacts to other molecules
w ithin the cr ystallographic un it cell (8). The central domain runs
from residues Cys-122 to Ser-211 and is composed of three
a-helices and four b-strands, whereas the C-terminal domain
(Gly-212 to A la-342) is composed of three a-helices and five
b-strands. The majority of the residues involved in substrate and
nucleotide binding are present at the inter face between these
two domains.

Comparison of VanA with DdlB. Analysis of the amino acid residues
in close prox imity to the substrate analogue shows there is a high
degree of conser vation between the two structures, except in the
v-loop region, which defines the active-site residues in DdlB (4,
6, 20, 21). The reactions of VanA and DdlB are similar in that
both have two steps: first the in itial D-A la substrate is bound and
phosphor ylated, and second, the peptide or acyl bond is formed
by the second substrate (D-A la or D-Lac) in a nucleophilic
reaction. Moreover, it has been pointed out (22) that D-A la in the
free-base state is, to a first approx imation, an equally good
substrate in VanA and DdlB. The distinctive property of VanA
is therefore its capacity to select D-Lac preferentially at physi-
ological pH.
An extra 37 residues are found in VanA compared w ith DdlB.
Inspection of the overlaid structures by using QUANTA (Molec-
ular Simulations) clearly shows the presence of a number of
extended loops in the VanA N-terminal domain that account for
the majority of these extra amino acids (see Fig. 1 b and c).
However, these additional loops have no obv ious function in
relation to the altered substrate activ ity of the enzyme. Detailed
comparison reveals that the v-loop region, which is important in
activ ity, dif fers in structure and composition between the two
enzymes. In DdlB, this segment consists of residues 205–220 and
contains two residues, Lys-215 and Ty r-216, w ithin a short
two-turn helix (H9) (6). These residues prov ide crucial hydrogen
bonds to the b-phosphate ox ygen atoms of ADP and maintain a
hydrogen bond triad w ith Glu-15 and Ser-150. In VanA, the
equivalent region (Arg-242–Asn-255) ex ists simply as an ex-
tended loop. Inspection of this loop in VanA reveals that His-244
replaces Ty r-216 and presents the appropriate chemistr y for the

Schematic diagram of the active site of VanA from the structure
showing the interaction of various water molecules in addition to amino acid
side chains. The protein backbone of the residues in the region of His-244 and
Tyr-315 is shown as a solid black line. Hydrogen bond distances between
Tyr-315, His-244, and the second subsite carboxyl oxygen of the transition
state inhibitor are 2.77 Å and 2.74 Å, respectively. Two phenylalanine residues
(F169 and F294) form stacking interactions with the adenine nucleotide rings.
Several water molecules in the active site form interactions with the phos-
phosphate and magnesium atoms as well as amino acid side chains. There is an
additional hydrogen bond between water 475 and water 371, which is not
shown for clarity.

sw itch from peptide to cataly tically assisted ester bond-forming
activ ity on binding D-lactate (see Fig. 2).
A more detailed comparison of the active sites of DdlB and
VanA identifies a conser ved water molecule, 444, in the second
subsite (not shown). It makes four tetrahedral hydrogen bonds:
w ith the side-chain amine of Arg-290 (Arg-255 in DdlB), w ith the
main-chain n itrogen of Ty r-318 ( Val-282 in DdlB), w ith
the main-chain carbonyl of Gly-311 (Gly-276 in DdlB), and
w ith the carbox ylate group of the inhibitor in the second subsite.
However, consideration of its position and hydrogen-bonding
interactions make it an unlikely candidate to participate in the
abstraction of a proton from the incoming nucleophile during
catalysis (see below); presumably this water has a structural role.
A second and unanticipated feature of the VanA loop is the
replacement of the DdlB Lys-215, which interacts directly w ith
and balances the charge of the phosphate group by a network of
four well-ordered waters (475, 371, 569, and 575) (see Fig. 3 a
and b). These waters form a stabilizing hydrogen bond network
to the ox ygens of both phosphates of ADP, to one of the bound
magnesium atoms, and to the phosphate of the transition-state
analogue. This arrangement of water molecules also displaces
Asn-292 (Asn-257 in DdlB), which now coordinates to its nearest
magnesium atom v ia water molecule 569, also bound by Asn-304.
The second magnesium atom in the VanA active site maintains
the interactions w ith the ADP and inhibitor phosphates seen in
DdlB and specifically hydrogen bonds w ith Glu-305 and Asn-
307. These interactions are augmented by a bound water atom,
574 (not found in DdlB), and this in turn forms a network w ith
the main-chain carbonyl on Ser-175 and adjacent water.

(a) Comparison of active site waters in E. facieum VanA, which replace Lys-215 in E. coli DdlB. Magnesium atoms are shown in gray with water molecules
in red. The structures of VanA and DdlB were superimposed and the relative positions of waters in VanA and Lys-215 in DdlB compared. Water 475 in VanA takes
an equivalent position to the side-chain nitrogen of Lys-215 in DdlB. Hydrogen-bonding distances between adjacent water molecules, magnesium atoms, and
phosphate atoms are not shown for clarity. Other water molecules, notably W371, W569, and W574, coordinate with magnesium ions in the active site of VanA.

is contoured at 1sby using the ﬁnal 2.5-Å resolution map. Residues in the immediate vicinity of the transition state intermediate are marked. The two magnesium
ions that coordinate with the phosphate ion of the intermediate and the b-phosphate of ADP are displayed in gray, and water molecules in this vicinity are
displayed in red. Water 475 in VanA takes an equivalent position to the side-chain nitrogen of Lys-215 in DdlB. Other water molecules, notably W371 and W574,
coordinate with magnesium ions in the active site of VanA. (c) Stereo diagram of the hydrogen bonding interacts with and in the vicinity of the phosphorylated
phosphinate inhibitor in the active site. The Glu-250, Lys-22, Tyr-4315, and His-244 hydrogen-bonding network is shown, making a 2.7-Å hydrogen bond with
the carboxylate oxygen of the inhibitor. This carboxylate also hydrogen bonds to a conserved serine (316 in VanA), which is not shown for clarity. The position
of His-244 in our structure is such that it cannot make hydrogen-bonding interactions with the Glu-16 and Ser-177, which are structurally conserved in comparison
to DdlB. The later two amino acids form important interactions that anchor D-Ala in the ﬁrst subsite, an analogous situation to that found in DdlB.

A third difference between the two enzymes is the pattern of
contacts with the ligand at the second subsite. This ligand has a
phosphor yl group at the junction of the carbonyl amide bond and
is a transition-state analogue. In the VanA complex, His-244 is in
hydrogen-bonding distance to the inhibitor carboxylate: in DdlB,
however, its spatial equivalent in DdlB, Tyr-216, makes no contacts
to the inhibitor but is linked by hydrogen bonds to Ser-150 and
Glu-15. It is assumed that the real substrate experiences these or
similar interactions during binding and reaction. There will be
differences, probably small, resulting from the absence of amide
NH and ester O and the b-carbon. The hydrogen-bonding network
equivalent to Tyr-216, Ser-150, and Glu-15 in DdlB is broken in the
VanA inhibitor complex by the conformation of the imidazole ring
in His-244 (see Fig. 3c). Nonetheless, in VanA the equivalent
Ser-177 remains H-bonded to Glu-16. It is important to the
discussion below on the VanA specificity that we expect, in the
absence of substrate, that the His-244 forms a H-bonding pattern
equivalent to that of Tyr-216 in DdlB.
The possible role of His-244 in the mechanism has been recently
explored by site-directed mutagenesis (22). As discussed above,
when VanA has only the phosphor ylated alanine in its first subsite,
His-244 is likely to be in a different position than that seen in the
cr ystal structure complex, thus allowing access to the active site by
the second ligand. Then a possible component in VanA’s selectivity
for lactate could come from the positive charge at His-244, which
at neutral pH would at least be partly protonated, a state that would
repel the alanine zwitter ion. And of course a positive charge on the
His-244 would attract the negatively charged lactate to the second
subsite. We note that the mutation His-2443Ala increases Km by
77-fold (0.69 mM to 53 mM) for the D-lac substrate in the second
site, producing a 170-fold change in the kcatyKm specificity constant
(22). In contrast, the same mutation in VanA reduces the Km for
alanine by only 2-fold (160 mM to 87 mM), with a ver y slight
increase in turnover. These observations demonstrate that the
imidazole ring is important mainly in substrate specificity by
preferentially favoring lactate binding over alanine. It is not obvious
why this is so. The H-bonding to the carboxylate present in the
inhibitor complex will occur presumably with D-Lac and D-Ala.
There is no obvious interaction between His-244 and the phos-
phor yl ox ygen and the inhibitor. Perhaps in the real substrate
there is such an interaction, explain ing the high Km for D-L ac.
The kinetic data show that at pH 7.5, the kcat for lactate is 35 per
minute, and that of alanine, 500 (22), indicating that the enzyme’s
active site actually prefers the alanine as the second substrate. The
mutational data (His-2443Ala) on VanA (22) indicate that the
His-244 makes no significant contribution to kcat for the alanine

substrate; there is, on the other hand, a 2-fold reduction in kcat with
this mutation for lactate (22). Thus, although slower, the lactate
reaction appears to involve His-244, possibly as a base. Because the
pK of imidazole nitrogen is about pH 7, at neutral pH, a population
of the His will be unprotonated and able to act as a base, potentially
accepting protons from the lactate OH but evidently not from the
alanine NH2. In conclusion, therefore, VanA’s heightened selec-
tivity for lactate in comparison to other D-Ala-D-Lac ligases rests on
the presence of His-244 as either a charged or neutral species and
on the interactions it makes in the Michaelis complex. Supporting
the structural role of His-244 in VanA is the structure of the D-Ala
D-Lac ligase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, a soil organism with
intrinsic vancomycin resistance (23). In this enzyme, Phe-261
occupies the same spatial position as Tyr-216 in DdlB and His-244
in VanA. The recent x-ray structure for this enzyme suggests that
the smaller size and greater hydrophobicity of the active site in
comparison to DdlB contributes to selectivity for lactate over
alanine (24). However, the L. mesenteroides enzyme has 10-fold
lower selectivity than VanA, suggesting that the potential electro-
static interactions possible with histidine provide greater specificity.
On the basis of the structure of VanA detailed in this work, it
would seem likely that the structure of VanB, an isofunctional
enzyme from Enterococcus faecalis V583 (25) that also possesses
D-A la-D-Lac-forming activ ity, w ill be ver y similar to VanA. The
two sequences are some 75% identical and, importantly, share
ver y close sequence conser vation in the VanA v-loop; identical
residues are found in the His-244 hydrogen-bond network. The
situation w ith VanC and VanC2, which are D-A la-D-serine ligase
from Enterococcus gallinar ium BM4174 and Enterococcus f lave-
scens, respectively (26, 27), is less clear, however. A lthough there
is obv ious general sequence similarity between VanA, VanB,
and the VanC subtypes, this does not include the all-important
v-loop region, where there appears to be a deletion in the VanC
type sequences. A full explanation of these dif ferences must
await a structure determination from this family of enzymes.
Further research into the structure and reactions of these and
other related enzymes w ill help in the design of specific inhibitors
and prov ide a route for new and ef fective antibiotic strategies.

The molecular basis of vancomycin resistance in
clinically relevant Enterococci: Crystal structure
of D-alanyl-D-lactate ligase (VanA)

D-alanine-D-lactate ligase from Enterococcus faecium BM4147 is
directly responsible for the biosynthesis of alternate cell-wall
precursors in bacteria, which are resistant to the glycopeptide
antibiotic vancomycin. The crystal structure has been determined
with data extending to 2.5-Å resolution. This structure shows that
the active site has unexpected interactions and is distinct from
previous models for D-alanyl-D-lactate ligase mechanistic studies. It
appears that the preference of the enzyme for lactate as a ligand
over D-alanine could be mediated by electrostatic effects andyor a
hydrogen-bonding network, which principally involve His-244. The
structure of D-alanyl-D-lactate ligase provides a revised interpre-
tation of the molecular events that lead to vancomycin resistance.

x-ray crystal structure

R esistance to commonly used antibiotics is a major clin ical
problem. The treatment of life-threaten ing Gram-positive
infections, such as those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphy-
lococcus aureus (MRSA), for example, depends at present on
treatment w ith antibiotics such as vancomycin and teicoplan in.
Vancomycin is now the last line of defense against MRSA and
many other multiple-antibiotic-resistant infections. It targets the
peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria by selectively
binding the D-alan ine-D-alan ine (D-A la) termin i of peptidogly-
can precursors and preventing their cross link ing to adjacent
strands. This sign ificantly weakens the structural integrity of the
cell wall and leads to osmotic lysis. Recently, however, strains of
Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of sepsis and
men ingitis, have become tolerant to vancomycin (1). Because the
more common high-level forms of vancomycin resistance are
associated w ith five genes encoded by mobile genetic elements
(2), there is a real probability that this resistance mechan ism
could well be acquired by other v irulent life-threaten ing infec-
tious agents such as MRSA. The clin ical isolates resistant to
vancomycin are characterized by a subtle change in the structure
of peptidoglycan termin i, as a result of the action of D-alanyl-D-X
ligases, which have dual-subsite specificity at their second amino
acid-binding site. The sw itch from D-A la-D-A la peptidoglycan
termin i to D-alan ine-D-lactate (D-A la-D-Lac) results in the loss
of crucial hydrogen-bonding interactions, causing a 1,000-fold
reduction of vancomycin-binding af fin ity.
Inducible high-level vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus
faecium BM4147 is associated w ith the five genes located on the
transposable element Tn1546 and is the most common clin ical
phenotype (2). A two-component transcriptional-activation sys-
tem of VanS and VanR controls the induction of three structural
genes VanH, VanA, and VanX. VanH is an a-keto acid reduc-
tase that converts py ruvate to D-Lac for D-A la-D-Lac synthesis
by the AT P-dependent desipeptide ligase, VanA (3). VanA is a
38.5-kDa protein capable of utilizing both hydrox yl acids and
D-A la as substrates w ith a concomitant sw itch from ester to
peptide bond formation dependent on pH (4). The presence of
any peptidoglycan chains ending in D-A la-D-A la, as a conse-
quence of endogenous peptidoglycan biosynthesis genes, is ne-
gated by the action of VanX, a Zn21-dependent D-A la-D-A la

dipeptidase (5). Thus the action of these three genes in concert
ensures the production of D-A la-D-Lac-terminating peptidogly-
can chains, which are bound ver y weakly by the glycopeptide
antibiotic vancomycin, rendering the bacteria resistant.
The first step in defin ing the structural and biochemical basis
of vancomycin resistance was the determination of the structure
of the enzyme [D-A la-D-A la ligase (DdlB), from Escher ichia coli]
that synthesizes the D-A la-D-A la moiety incorporated into the
normal vancomycin-susceptible cell walls (6). The sequence of
VanA and DdlB exhibits ’40% identity, and their overall folds
are ver y similar. The enzymes have similar functions in the
biosynthesis of peptidoglycan termin i in bacteria, but the capac-
ity of VanA to form D-A la-D-Lac has a direct correlation w ith
enterococcal resistance to vancomycin. In this paper, we report
the cr ystal structure of VanA complexed w ith a substrate
inhibitor (7) and define the residues involved in substrate binding
that are crucial to the resistance mechan ism.

Materials and Methods
Purification and Crystallization. The purification and cr ystallization
of the enzyme have been described in detail elsewhere (8).
Brief ly, the enzyme was cr ystallized by the hanging-drop-vapor
dif fusion method in the presence of a phosphinate inhibitor
analogue of D-A la-D-A la between 40% and 45% ammon ium
sulfate, 0.1 M Mops, pH 6.0, w ith cr ystals reaching dimensions
of 0.4 3 0.2 3 0.1 mm. A native dataset to 2.5 Å resolution was
collected and the space group determined as C2221 w ith cell
dimensions of a 5 123.2 Å, b 5 225 Å, and c 5 72.4 Å, w ith a
single dimer in the asymmetric un it. Data were collected w ith an
oscillation range of 1° per image by using a Cu-Ka radiation
source and a MAR345 image plate dev ice. Cr ystals were soaked
in mother liquor contain ing a glycerol concentration of 35% as
cr yoprotectant before f lash v itrification in a stream of N2 gas at
120 K. The data were processed and reduced by using the HKL
suite of programs (9).

Structure Determination and Refinement. Numerous attempts to

solve the structure of VanA by molecular replacement by using
a variety of programs had proved unsuccessful until recent
in-house developments in the molecular replacement program
MOLREP (10) became available. A solution was obtained by using

a search model (11), enabling the position of the VanA dimer
w ithin the asymmetric un it to be determined. Before refinement,
5% of the data were randomly f lagged for cross-validation
analysis (12). Rigid-body refinement as implemented in the
program REFMAC (13) was per formed on a polyalan ine model of
the structure solution div ided into three domains. Refinement
was carried out starting from 6 Å resolution w ith gradual
increments in resolution to 2.5 Å. Indiv idual atomic parameters
were refined by using REFMAC. With noncr ystallographic re-
straints, Rcr yst and Rfree values were reduced to 46% and 50%,
respectively. In itial phases were derived from these coordinates
by the program CAD (14) and improved by averaging, solvent
f latten ing, and histogram matching in the program DM (15), by
using a figure of merit calculated in REFMAC. Rebuilding from
this in itial model was carried out by using the X-AUTOFIT routine
implemented in the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations,
San Diego, CA). Af ter several cycles of rebuilding and refine-
ment, the density-modified maps were of suf ficient quality to
allow the modeling of residues 2–342, one AT P molecule and
one phosphinate transition state inhibitor per molecule. In
addition, a total of 397 waters, 3 sulfate ions, and 21 glycerol
molecules were modeled and included in refinement. The elec-
tron density associated w ith the glycerol molecules was larger
than that for a typical water and had a shape consistent w ith the
branched structure of glycerol. In many cases, the density
suggested that the glycerols were in more than one arrangement.
Generally, the atoms refined w ith ver y high B-factors, similar to
the mobile water molecules. It was decided at this stage not to

tr y to interpret these complex peaks in more detail either as
water or glycerol. The concentration of glycerol in the mother
liquor was 35%. Final refinement converged to an Rcr yst value of
0.205 and an Rfree value of 0.284 for data in the range of 15–2.5 Å.

Results and Discussion

Structure of VanA in Complex with ADP and Phosphinate Inhibitor.

The tertiar y structure of VanA in complex w ith ADP and a
phosphor ylated phosphinate inhibitor, an analogue of the tran-
sition-state species (7), is shown in Fig. 1a. The cr ystal structure
is well defined, w ith the electron-density maps continuous from
residues 2 to 342, the penultimate residue at the C terminus. The
structure has been refined w ith data extending to 2.5 Å; statis-
tical data for the final model are presented in Table 1. The
side-chain density for the two terminal residues is insuf ficient to
model side-chain atoms accurately, and these terminal residues
have been assigned as alan ine in our model. The enzyme’s
structure can be div ided into three domains w ith the nucleotide-
and substrate-binding sites formed predominantly between the
central and C-terminal domains; it has the characteristics of the
AT P-dependent carbox ylate –amineythiol
ligase super family
(16 –19). The N-terminal domain runs from A la-2 to Gly-121 and
has an ayb structure contain ing two a-helices and eight
b-strands. A loop extending from the ends of two of these strands
supports Glu-16, which is involved in substrate binding at the first
subsite and two residues, Val-19 and His-99, which are involved
in stabilizing the carbox yl an ion of the transition-state interme-
diate seen in the structure. Additionally,
in the N-terminal
domain there is unambiguous density for a disulphide bridge

formed between cysteines 52 and 64, which is not present in
DdlB. This disulphide bond was unexpected; VanA is a bacterial
intracellular enzyme and therefore is normally in a reducing
env ironment. However, the position ing of this disulphide bridge
is interesting in that it links two adjacent b-strands at the base
of a short loop. It is likely that formation of this disulphide bond
may have aided in the cr ystallization of VanA, as this disulphide-
stabilized loop makes some cr ystal contacts to other molecules
w ithin the cr ystallographic un it cell (8). The central domain runs
from residues Cys-122 to Ser-211 and is composed of three
a-helices and four b-strands, whereas the C-terminal domain
(Gly-212 to A la-342) is composed of three a-helices and five
b-strands. The majority of the residues involved in substrate and
nucleotide binding are present at the inter face between these
two domains.

Comparison of VanA with DdlB. Analysis of the amino acid residues
in close prox imity to the substrate analogue shows there is a high
degree of conser vation between the two structures, except in the
v-loop region, which defines the active-site residues in DdlB (4,
6, 20, 21). The reactions of VanA and DdlB are similar in that
both have two steps: first the in itial D-A la substrate is bound and
phosphor ylated, and second, the peptide or acyl bond is formed
by the second substrate (D-A la or D-Lac) in a nucleophilic
reaction. Moreover, it has been pointed out (22) that D-A la in the
free-base state is, to a first approx imation, an equally good
substrate in VanA and DdlB. The distinctive property of VanA
is therefore its capacity to select D-Lac preferentially at physi-
ological pH.
An extra 37 residues are found in VanA compared w ith DdlB.
Inspection of the overlaid structures by using QUANTA (Molec-
ular Simulations) clearly shows the presence of a number of
extended loops in the VanA N-terminal domain that account for
the majority of these extra amino acids (see Fig. 1 b and c).
However, these additional loops have no obv ious function in
relation to the altered substrate activ ity of the enzyme. Detailed
comparison reveals that the v-loop region, which is important in
activ ity, dif fers in structure and composition between the two
enzymes. In DdlB, this segment consists of residues 205–220 and
contains two residues, Lys-215 and Ty r-216, w ithin a short
two-turn helix (H9) (6). These residues prov ide crucial hydrogen
bonds to the b-phosphate ox ygen atoms of ADP and maintain a
hydrogen bond triad w ith Glu-15 and Ser-150. In VanA, the
equivalent region (Arg-242–Asn-255) ex ists simply as an ex-
tended loop. Inspection of this loop in VanA reveals that His-244
replaces Ty r-216 and presents the appropriate chemistr y for the

Schematic diagram of the active site of VanA from the structure
showing the interaction of various water molecules in addition to amino acid
side chains. The protein backbone of the residues in the region of His-244 and
Tyr-315 is shown as a solid black line. Hydrogen bond distances between
Tyr-315, His-244, and the second subsite carboxyl oxygen of the transition
state inhibitor are 2.77 Å and 2.74 Å, respectively. Two phenylalanine residues
(F169 and F294) form stacking interactions with the adenine nucleotide rings.
Several water molecules in the active site form interactions with the phos-
phosphate and magnesium atoms as well as amino acid side chains. There is an
additional hydrogen bond between water 475 and water 371, which is not
shown for clarity.

sw itch from peptide to cataly tically assisted ester bond-forming
activ ity on binding D-lactate (see Fig. 2).
A more detailed comparison of the active sites of DdlB and
VanA identifies a conser ved water molecule, 444, in the second
subsite (not shown). It makes four tetrahedral hydrogen bonds:
w ith the side-chain amine of Arg-290 (Arg-255 in DdlB), w ith the
main-chain n itrogen of Ty r-318 ( Val-282 in DdlB), w ith
the main-chain carbonyl of Gly-311 (Gly-276 in DdlB), and
w ith the carbox ylate group of the inhibitor in the second subsite.
However, consideration of its position and hydrogen-bonding
interactions make it an unlikely candidate to participate in the
abstraction of a proton from the incoming nucleophile during
catalysis (see below); presumably this water has a structural role.
A second and unanticipated feature of the VanA loop is the
replacement of the DdlB Lys-215, which interacts directly w ith
and balances the charge of the phosphate group by a network of
four well-ordered waters (475, 371, 569, and 575) (see Fig. 3 a
and b). These waters form a stabilizing hydrogen bond network
to the ox ygens of both phosphates of ADP, to one of the bound
magnesium atoms, and to the phosphate of the transition-state
analogue. This arrangement of water molecules also displaces
Asn-292 (Asn-257 in DdlB), which now coordinates to its nearest
magnesium atom v ia water molecule 569, also bound by Asn-304.
The second magnesium atom in the VanA active site maintains
the interactions w ith the ADP and inhibitor phosphates seen in
DdlB and specifically hydrogen bonds w ith Glu-305 and Asn-
307. These interactions are augmented by a bound water atom,
574 (not found in DdlB), and this in turn forms a network w ith
the main-chain carbonyl on Ser-175 and adjacent water.

an equivalent position to the side-chain nitrogen of Lys-215 in DdlB. Hydrogen-bonding distances between adjacent water molecules, magnesium atoms, and
phosphate atoms are not shown for clarity. Other water molecules, notably W371, W569, and W574, coordinate with magnesium ions in the active site of VanA.

ions that coordinate with the phosphate ion of the intermediate and the b-phosphate of ADP are displayed in gray, and water molecules in this vicinity are
displayed in red. Water 475 in VanA takes an equivalent position to the side-chain nitrogen of Lys-215 in DdlB. Other water molecules, notably W371 and W574,
coordinate with magnesium ions in the active site of VanA. (c) Stereo diagram of the hydrogen bonding interacts with and in the vicinity of the phosphorylated
phosphinate inhibitor in the active site. The Glu-250, Lys-22, Tyr-4315, and His-244 hydrogen-bonding network is shown, making a 2.7-Å hydrogen bond with
the carboxylate oxygen of the inhibitor. This carboxylate also hydrogen bonds to a conserved serine (316 in VanA), which is not shown for clarity. The position
of His-244 in our structure is such that it cannot make hydrogen-bonding interactions with the Glu-16 and Ser-177, which are structurally conserved in comparison
to DdlB. The later two amino acids form important interactions that anchor D-Ala in the ﬁrst subsite, an analogous situation to that found in DdlB.

A third difference between the two enzymes is the pattern of
contacts with the ligand at the second subsite. This ligand has a
phosphor yl group at the junction of the carbonyl amide bond and
is a transition-state analogue. In the VanA complex, His-244 is in
hydrogen-bonding distance to the inhibitor carboxylate: in DdlB,
however, its spatial equivalent in DdlB, Tyr-216, makes no contacts
to the inhibitor but is linked by hydrogen bonds to Ser-150 and
Glu-15. It is assumed that the real substrate experiences these or
similar interactions during binding and reaction. There will be
differences, probably small, resulting from the absence of amide
NH and ester O and the b-carbon. The hydrogen-bonding network
equivalent to Tyr-216, Ser-150, and Glu-15 in DdlB is broken in the
VanA inhibitor complex by the conformation of the imidazole ring
in His-244 (see Fig. 3c). Nonetheless, in VanA the equivalent
Ser-177 remains H-bonded to Glu-16. It is important to the
discussion below on the VanA specificity that we expect, in the
absence of substrate, that the His-244 forms a H-bonding pattern
equivalent to that of Tyr-216 in DdlB.
The possible role of His-244 in the mechanism has been recently
explored by site-directed mutagenesis (22). As discussed above,
when VanA has only the phosphor ylated alanine in its first subsite,
His-244 is likely to be in a different position than that seen in the
cr ystal structure complex, thus allowing access to the active site by
the second ligand. Then a possible component in VanA’s selectivity
for lactate could come from the positive charge at His-244, which
at neutral pH would at least be partly protonated, a state that would
repel the alanine zwitter ion. And of course a positive charge on the
His-244 would attract the negatively charged lactate to the second
subsite. We note that the mutation His-2443Ala increases Km by
77-fold (0.69 mM to 53 mM) for the D-lac substrate in the second
site, producing a 170-fold change in the kcatyKm specificity constant
(22). In contrast, the same mutation in VanA reduces the Km for
alanine by only 2-fold (160 mM to 87 mM), with a ver y slight
increase in turnover. These observations demonstrate that the
imidazole ring is important mainly in substrate specificity by
preferentially favoring lactate binding over alanine. It is not obvious
why this is so. The H-bonding to the carboxylate present in the
inhibitor complex will occur presumably with D-Lac and D-Ala.
There is no obvious interaction between His-244 and the phos-
phor yl ox ygen and the inhibitor. Perhaps in the real substrate
there is such an interaction, explain ing the high Km for D-L ac.
The kinetic data show that at pH 7.5, the kcat for lactate is 35 per
minute, and that of alanine, 500 (22), indicating that the enzyme’s
active site actually prefers the alanine as the second substrate. The
mutational data (His-2443Ala) on VanA (22) indicate that the
His-244 makes no significant contribution to kcat for the alanine

substrate; there is, on the other hand, a 2-fold reduction in kcat with
this mutation for lactate (22). Thus, although slower, the lactate
reaction appears to involve His-244, possibly as a base. Because the
pK of imidazole nitrogen is about pH 7, at neutral pH, a population
of the His will be unprotonated and able to act as a base, potentially
accepting protons from the lactate OH but evidently not from the
alanine NH2. In conclusion, therefore, VanA’s heightened selec-
tivity for lactate in comparison to other D-Ala-D-Lac ligases rests on
the presence of His-244 as either a charged or neutral species and
on the interactions it makes in the Michaelis complex. Supporting
the structural role of His-244 in VanA is the structure of the D-Ala
D-Lac ligase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, a soil organism with
intrinsic vancomycin resistance (23). In this enzyme, Phe-261
occupies the same spatial position as Tyr-216 in DdlB and His-244
in VanA. The recent x-ray structure for this enzyme suggests that
the smaller size and greater hydrophobicity of the active site in
comparison to DdlB contributes to selectivity for lactate over
alanine (24). However, the L. mesenteroides enzyme has 10-fold
lower selectivity than VanA, suggesting that the potential electro-
static interactions possible with histidine provide greater specificity.
On the basis of the structure of VanA detailed in this work, it
would seem likely that the structure of VanB, an isofunctional
enzyme from Enterococcus faecalis V583 (25) that also possesses
D-A la-D-Lac-forming activ ity, w ill be ver y similar to VanA. The
two sequences are some 75% identical and, importantly, share
ver y close sequence conser vation in the VanA v-loop; identical
residues are found in the His-244 hydrogen-bond network. The
situation w ith VanC and VanC2, which are D-A la-D-serine ligase
from Enterococcus gallinar ium BM4174 and Enterococcus f lave-
scens, respectively (26, 27), is less clear, however. A lthough there
is obv ious general sequence similarity between VanA, VanB,
and the VanC subtypes, this does not include the all-important
v-loop region, where there appears to be a deletion in the VanC
type sequences. A full explanation of these dif ferences must
await a structure determination from this family of enzymes.
Further research into the structure and reactions of these and
other related enzymes w ill help in the design of specific inhibitors
and prov ide a route for new and ef fective antibiotic strategies.
