ABSTRACT. A previous analysis of two chloroplast gene regions, rbcL and the rps16 intron, showed a clear phylogenetic
pattern in Gunnera. However, these regions were not informative enough to completely resolve the phylogeny. In this study
the nuclear ITS region was sequenced for 24 specimens representing 22 species of Gunnera. 223 characters out of 819 were
informative and supported the same monophyletic groups as the chloroplast gene regions. Because of its greater information
content, the ITS region identiﬁed additional well-supported clades. In an analysis based on the three gene regions together,
272 characters out of 3154 were informative. The results show that the South American annual, G. herteri is sister to all other
species. The African G. perpensa is well-supported as sister to the remaining species, which form two well-deﬁned clades,
one with the Malayan G. macrophylla as sister to subgenus Milligania from New Zealand and Tasmania. In the other clade,
the South American subgenus Misandra is sister group to subgenus Panke from South America and Hawaii. Within Panke
the two Hawaiian species form a sister group to the American species. The morphological classiﬁcation of Schindler, together
with some biogeographical and morphological features, is discussed.

The systematically isolated genus Gunnera, with 30–
40 species in Central and South America, Africa, Mad-
agascar, Tasmania, New Zealand, Hawaii, and the Ma-
layan Archipelago (Bader 1961), has long intrigued
botanists. It has usually been included in the Halora-
gaceae in the Myrtales, but the systematic position has
remained doubtful, and the genus is sometimes placed
in a family of its own. Even though the disjunct south-
ern distribution and its unique relationship with en-
dosymbiotic cyanobacteria continued to attract atten-
tion, it was not until recently that the isolated position
of Gunnera in the tricolpate clade was recognized
(Chase et al. 1993).
The only monograph of the genus was published
by Schindler in 1905. He divided Gunnera into ﬁve sub-
genera, Perpensum, Pseudogunnera, Panke, Misandra, and
Milligania, mainly based on size, means of vegetative
propagation, and geographic distribution. Schindler’s
subgenus Perpensum only includes the African G. per-
pensa, which is the type species for the genus (Linnae-
us 1767). For nomenclatural reasons (Greuter et al.
2000), the subgenus name Perpensum should therefore
be replaced with Gunnera. The species from New Zea-
land and the single Australian species G. cordifolia were
included in subgenus Milligania. Subgenus Misandra
includes only two species, G. lobata and G. magellanica,
restricted to the southern part of South America. To
subgenus Panke belong all the huge South and Central
American species of Gunnera as well as the two Ha-
waiian species. Subgenus Pseudogunnera includes only
the Malayan G. macrophylla. Schindler’s classiﬁcation
was completed in 1933 by the addition of a new sub-
genus, Ostenigunnera (Mattfeld 1933),
in connection
with the discovery of the new, morphologically dis-

tinct, species G. herteri, among the sand dunes of the
Atlantic coast in Uruguay. That G. herteri is an annual
species, the only in the genus, was noted only recently
(Wanntorp et al. 2001).
In 1995, some preliminary results on the phylogeny
of Gunnera based on morphological and anatomical
characters were summarized in an abstract by Fuller.
In 2001, Wanntorp et al. published a phylogenetic
study of Gunnera based on sequences from the chlo-
roplast genome (Fig. 1). It was found that the South
American Gunnera herteri is sister to all other species.
Gunnera perpensa from Africa was weakly supported
as sister group to the remaining species, which in turn
formed two, well-supported clades. One included the
Malayan G. macrophylla, the single Australian species
G. cordifolia and the species from New Zealand. The
second clade comprised the South American and Ha-
waiian species.
The rbcL and rps16 intron regions used in that study
gave only 49 informative characters, which was not
enough to completely resolve the phylogeny. The po-
sition of the African G. perpensa remained doubtful.
The relationship was still unresolved between G. ma-
gellanica and the Panke group in the South American
species as was much of the relationship within the Ma-
layan-Australasian clade (Fig. 1).
A better resolved phylogeny of Gunnera will aid in
studying its disjunct distribution as well as in under-
standing the evolution of characters such as means of
propagation and those traits connected with the sym-
biosis with the cyanobacteria (Wanntorp in prep.).
The aim of the present study is to further investi-
gate the phylogeny of Gunnera by including several
more species and by studying another gene region, the

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Choice of Outgroup. A small African genus of shrubby plants,
Myrothamnus, is well supported as sister group and the only close
relative of Gunnera in recent molecular studies based on rbcL, atpB
and 18S (Hoot et al. 1999; Soltis et al. 2000). Myrothamnus includes
two species, M. ﬂabellifolius from parts of Africa and M. moschatus
endemic to Madagascar (Endress 1989). Of these two species, only
M. ﬂabellifolius has been sequenced so far. This species was also
used as outgroup in the previous rbcL/rps16 intron study of Gun-
nera (Wanntorp et al. 2001). Myrothamnus could unfortunately not
be used as outgroup in the present study because the primers used
for the ampliﬁcation of the ITS region in Gunnera did not work for
M. ﬂabellifolius. The lack of adequate primers led us to try universal
primers that produced DNA of low yield. Multiple copies of ITS
were also detected. The rbcL/rps16 intron analysis identiﬁed G.
herteri as sister group to all the other included species of Gunnera
(Wanntorp et al. 2001). The support for this placement was very
high, so G. herteri was used as outgroup in the present ITS anal-
ysis. In the analysis combining rbcL, rps16 intron, and ITS sequenc-
es, M. ﬂabellifolius was used as outgroup and its missing ITS se-
quence was replaced by questions marks.
Ingroup Sampling. The intention of this study was to include
as many species as possible of Gunnera. Sequences of 24 specimens
representing 22 different species of Gunnera (Table 1) were includ-
ed in the combined analysis. Twelve species belonging to subge-
nus Panke were sampled to cover as much of geographic distri-
bution as possible. Unfortunately, Panke is still under-represented
from Colombia, where many endemic species occur (Mora-Osejo
1984). Gunnera chilensis was collected in mainland Chile; G. peltata,
G. bracteata, and G. masafuerae were collected in the Juan Ferna´ ndez
Islands, and the ITS sequences from the latter two species were
kindly provided by Dr. E. Ruiz (Universidad de Concepcio´ n,

Chile). Material of G. brasiliensis collected in the Serra do Mar in
southeastern Brazil as well as a cultivated specimen of G. manicata
were included in the present study. In the previous molecular
study of Wanntorp et al. (2001), the rbcL sequence of G. manicata
was retrieved from GenBank but the rps16 intron for this species
was not sequenced due to the lack of material from the same
source. In this study, a cultivated specimen of G. manicata not stud-
ied previously was sequenced. Although we are working with dif-
ferent specimens for the rbcL and ITS sequences, we treat these
cultivated specimens as representing the same taxon in the com-
bined analysis. Subgenus Panke is also represented by G. boliviana,
G. pilosa, G. talamancana, and G. insignis collected in Bolivia, Equa-
dor, Costa Rica, and Panama, respectively. From Hawaii, G. peta-
loidea was collected on Maui and G. kauaiensis on Kauai. Gunnera
perpensa has sometimes been considered to consist of a complex
of different species or varieties (Schindler 1905; Skottsberg 1936).
For this reason two specimens, one collected in Tanzania, the other
in South Africa, were included. Gunnera macrophylla from subgenus
Pseudogunnera, sometimes regarded as a complex species (van der
Post 1855) was represented by two different specimens from Su-
matra and Java, respectively. The previous discovery of structur-
ally different sequences of rbcL in these specimens (Wanntorp et
al. 2001) was another reason for including both in the present anal-
ysis. Subgenus Misandra from South America was represented by
G. magellanica and G. lobata, both collected in Chile. From subgenus
Milligania, four species from New Zealand were included (G. den-
tata, G. hamiltonii, G. monoica, and G. prorepens), together with G.
cordifolia from Tasmania. Lastly, Gunnera herteri collected in Uru-
guay was added to the ingroup in the rbcL/rps16 intron/ITS anal-
ysis.
DNA Extraction, Ampliﬁcation and Sequencing. Extracts were
made from living plants or from silica-gel dried leaf fragments
collected in the ﬁeld. DNA extractions, PCR ampliﬁcation, and se-
quencing were conducted following Wanntorp et al. 2001. The
primers (18SF and 26SR) used for ampliﬁcation and sequencing of
Gunnera were situated at the 3⬘-end of 18S and the 5⬘-end of the
26S, respectively (the primer sequences were obtained from C. Ry-

din, Stockholm University, Sweden, who designed them). In ad-
dition, the primers C26A (TTTCTTTTCCTCCGCT, designed by Dr.
Youngbae Suh at Seoul National University, Korea) and 340F
(GGCAACGGATATCTCGGCTCTCG, designed by L. Wanntorp)
were used for sequencing. All sequences were assembled and ed-
ited using the Staden package (Staden 1996) and GDE (Smith et
al. 1994). The sequences have been deposited in GenBank. The
Genbank accession numbers are given in Table 1.
In the previous study of Wanntorp et al. (2001) the rbcL sequenc-
es of G. monoica and G. macrophylla were shorter. It was suspected
that the phylogenetic relationship between these two species was
due to a retrieved pseudogene. Recently the rbcL gene of G. mon-
oica was sequenced once again (Wardle et al. 2001), and this time
a sequence of usual length was found. In the combined analysis
of the three genes in the present study we felt more conﬁdent in
using this rbcL sequence instead of the sequence used in the pre-
vious molecular study. New in this analysis is also the rbcL se-
quence of G. lobata (Wardle et al. 2001).
Phylogenetic Analyses. A variety of parameters was explored
in the alignment of the ITS sequences performed with the package
ClustalX 1,8-PPC (Thomson et al. 1997). The ﬁnal alignment was
adjusted manually, so as to keep the number of the total muta-
tional changes to a minimum (the aligned data matrix can be ob-
tained from the ﬁrst author upon request). Indels were included
in the analyses and coded according to the principles suggested
by Simmons and Ochoterena (2000). Substitutions and indels were
given equal weight in all phylogenetic analyses.
An analysis of the ITS region alone was performed using Gun-
nera herteri as outgroup. A combined analysis based on rbcL, rps16
intron, and ITS was then performed using Myrothamnus ﬂabellifol-
ius as outgroup. For some of the species, sequences of all the three
gene regions were not available (Table 1). Question marks were
therefore used for these sequences. We chose to do this, rather than
to prune all these sequences from the analysis, to get as much
information as possible from our material. As a result, 37% of the
total data set was scored as missing data, representing 16% of the
informative data matrix.
All phylogenies were inferred using the program PAUP* version
4.0b6 (Swofford 2001). Bootstrap analyses based on 1,000 repli-
cates were performed to explore the robustness of the trees. The
following options were used for all analyses: parsimony, branch
and bound search, stepwise furthest addition sequence, collapse
zero-length branches. Bremer support (1994) was calculated using
the program Autodecay version 4.0.2⬘ PPC (Eriksson 1998).

RESULTS

The ITS Analysis. The sequenced 22 nucleotides of
the 18S region did not contain any informative char-
acters, six informative characters were detected in the
sequenced part of the 26S region (79 nucleotides), ITS1
and ITS2 contributed 105 and 92 informative charac-
ters, respectively. The conserved 5.8 S subunit yielded
four informative characters. A complication sometimes
encountered working with the ITS region is the pres-
ence of polymorphic copies of this region. This prob-
lem was not encountered in Gunnera.
The ITS analysis included 24 sequences representing
22 species. Using G. herteri as outgroup, 223 characters
out of 819 were informative (including 16 informative
indel characters). The strict consensus tree of 30 most
parsimonious trees is shown in Fig. 2 (tree length ⫽
452; CI ⫽ 0.84; RI ⫽ 0.94).
The two specimens of G. perpensa group strongly to-
gether (bootstrap value 100%; decay index 47) and
form the sister group of all other species of the ingroup
(bootstrap value 100%; decay index 16). These remain-

ing species are divided into two very well-supported
clades, one including the American and Hawaiian spe-
cies (bootstrap value 100%; decay index 31), and an-
other including the species from Malaya, New Zea-
land, and Tasmania (bootstrap value 100%; decay in-
dex 26). The South American/Hawaiian clade forms a
trichotomy. One subclade is formed by the two species
G. magellanica and G. lobata (bootstrap value 100%; de-
cay index 8). The second subclade consists of the Ha-
waiian species, G. petaloidea and G. kauaiensis (bootstrap
value 100%; decay index 15). The third subclade con-
sists of all American species of subgenus Panke (boot-
strap value 99%; decay index 5). Within this subclade
there is generally little resolution. Gunnera manicata and
G. brasiliensis group strongly together (bootstrap value
98%; decay index 4), forming a poorly supported
group with G. boliviana (bootstrap value 52%; decay
index 1). This group is weakly supported as sister
group to the remaining American species. Among
them, the Chilean species form a weakly supported
group (bootstrap value 51 %; decay index 1). This was
in turn divided into two subclades: Gunnera chilensis
groups strongly with G. masafuerae (bootstrap value
98%; decay index 4), G. peltata and G. bracteata are sister
species (bootstrap value 69%; decay index 1).
In the second main clade, the two specimens of the
Malayan G. macrophylla form the sister group (boot-
strap value 87%; decay index 2) to a subclade including
all the species from New Zealand and Tasmania (boot-
strap value 86%; decay index 4). Within this subclade
G. monoica is sister taxon to the other species (bootstrap
value 84%; decay index 3). Next, Gunnera hamiltonii is
the well-supported (bootstrap value 96%; decay index
4) sister to a subclade formed by G. cordifolia, which is
in turn sister to G. dentata and G. prorepens, the latter
two forming a weakly supported group (bootstrap val-
ue 62%; decay index 1).
The Combined Analysis.
In the combined analysis
of rbcL, rps16 intron, and ITS, 272 of 3154 characters
were informative. The strict consensus tree for the 15
most parsimonious trees recovered is shown in Fig. 3
(tree length ⫽ 722; CI ⫽ 0.82; RI ⫽ 0.92). As in the
previous rbcL/rps16 intron analysis, G. herteri emerged
as sister to all other Gunnera species with a very high
support (bootstrap value 100%, decay index 8). Apart
from some different support values, the general topol-
ogy obtained by the ITS analysis was again retrieved
in the combined analysis. The only signiﬁcant change
from the ITS topology is that subgenus Misandra (G.
magellanica and G. lobata) now emerges as a poorly sup-
ported sister group to a monophyletic Panke (bootstrap
value 57%, decay index 1). The Hawaiian species (G.
kauaiensis and G. petaloidea) are now the sister group of
the American species of the subgenus (bootstrap value
99%, decay index 5).

DISCUSSION

The present study has generally corroborated the re-
sults obtained in the rbcL/rps16 intron study (Wann-
torp et al. 2001). The considerably higher number of
informative characters in the ITS region and the en-
hanced number of taxa of this study led to the further
resolution of the tree, and some of the previously sug-
gested monophyletic groups received higher support.
The well-supported position of Gunnera herteri as sister
group to the remaining species, found by the chloro-
plast data (Wanntorp et al. 2001), was not further in-
vestigated in the present study (see Choice of Out-
group). Here, Gunnera perpensa was found as sister to
two main clades, one containing all species from New
Zealand, Tasmania, and Malaya, the other formed by
South American and Hawaiian representatives. Within
the former clade there was good resolution. Within the
South American/Hawaiian clade, the position of the
Hawaiian species as sister to the American Panke was
retrieved with considerable support. The phylogenetic
relationships of the 22 species of Gunnera examined in
the present study is discussed below in relation to the

classiﬁcation of Schindler. Some morphological and
biogeographical issues are also introduced.
Subgenus Ostenigunnera, the Annual Species. Gun-
nera herteri was originally thought to be a perennial like
all other Gunnera species (Mattfeld 1933). Its annual
habit was ﬁrst discovered in the ﬁeld by the two ﬁrst
authors and this was corroborated through cultivation
(Wanntorp et al. 2001). This species is placed at the
base of the cladogram based on the chloroplast se-
quences. Gunnera herteri is somewhat divergent from
the rest of the species in its molecular sequences. Sev-
eral of the traits in its habit are also unique, which
would make G. herteri a poor standard for deducing
ancestral morphological traits in Gunnera. Gunnera her-
teri was also supported as sister to the other species
of the genus in the morphological study of Fuller
(1995).
Subgenus Gunnera, the African Species. The ITS
and the rps16 intron data suggested that G. perpensa is
sister group to a clade consisting of all remaining spe-
cies of Gunnera. The rbcL data, instead, placed G. per-
pensa as sister to the South American subgenera Mis-
andra and Panke. The placement of G. perpensa in a sep-

arate subgenus as suggested by Schindler (1905) is
conﬁrmed by our study (Fig. 3). Like Panke, Gunnera
perpensa is characterised by thick, polystelic rhizomes
(Wilkinson 2000), but in contrast to the erect or as-
cending unbranched stems of Panke, the rhizomes of
G. perpensa are creeping and branching. According to
our results (Fig. 3), the thick, polystelic rhizomes are
not homologous in these two subgenera. The morpho-
logical study of Fuller (1995) suggested that the Afri-
can species G. perpensa and the Malayan G. macrophylla
could ‘‘best be merged into a single lineage.’’ We did
not ﬁnd any support for this result. The position of G.
perpensa as sister to the other species of Gunnera, ex-
cepting only G. herteri, is, in contrast, a well-supported
result of the present study as well as the position of
G. macrophylla as sister to Milligania.
Gunnera perpensa occurs in South Africa and on
mountains along the Great Rift Valley from Zimbabwe
and Mozambique, over Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Ken-
ya, Tanzania, and Uganda all the way to Sudan and
Ethiopia (Boutique and Verdcourt 1973). It is also
found in the central parts of Madagascar. Schindler
(1905) considered G. perpensa to consist of three vari-

eties different in geographic distribution. The variety
growing in Madagascar was named angusta due to its
narrow inﬂorescence. The variety kilimandscharica from
East Tropical Africa and Ethiopia is said to differ from
the South African type specimen by hairless petals and
stalked drupes. Skottsberg (1936) considered the sub-
genus to include four species, one growing in South
Africa, one in Tanzania, one in Ethiopia, and one on
Madagascar, and he thought the distribution to be very
ancient. We had access to two of Skottsberg’s pre-
sumed taxa of G. perpensa, the one from Tanzania and
the other from South Africa. Their ITS sequences were
not completely identical, but still very similar, differing
at a few base pairs only, and grouped together with
high support. We could also notice how similar the
two plants were in morphology, but the differences re-
ported between at least some of the ‘‘varieties’’ seem
to us no less than those considered to separate species
in the subgenus Panke.
Subgenus Pseudogunnera, the Malayan Species.
Subgenus Pseudogunnera consists of the single species
G. macrophylla, which is widespread in the Malayan
area, occurring on mountains in New Guinea, the Sol-

[Volume 27

omon Islands, Sulawesi, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and the
Philippines. The analyses based on the single ITS re-
gion, as well as on all three gene regions, clearly place
G. macrophylla as a well-supported sister to subgenus
Milligania, which includes all species from New Zea-
land and Tasmania (Figs. 2, 3).
In the cladogram from Wanntorp et al. (2001) based
on rbcL and rps16 intron only, G. macrophylla was
placed inside Milligania as sister group of G. monoica
from New Zealand. Because the rps16 intron alone in-
stead placed G. macrophylla as sister group to Milligan-
ia, the previous result was suspected to have been
caused by the isolation of the same paralogous pseu-
dogene copy of the rbcL in these two species (Wann-
torp et al. 2001). A recent study (Wardle et al. 2001)
identiﬁed a rbcL sequence from G. monoica of usual
length. When this sequence was used in the rbcL anal-
ysis there was no longer any indication of a close re-
lationship between G. monoica and G. macrophylla. This
supports the presence of two copies of the rbcL gene
in these species, and that the apparent close relation-
ship between G. monoica and G. macrophylla was due to
the isolation of a pseudogene.
In its large size and reniform leaf shape G. macro-
phylla is somewhat similar to G. perpensa and the spe-
cies of subgenus Panke, but the Malayan species shares
the propagation by slender stolons with the species of
subgenus Milligania and Misandra. As in subgenus Mil-
ligania, the stolons have two opposite apical bracts,
subtending the short erect leafy stem. Also the bright-
colored juicy drupes of G. macrophylla, are more similar
to the fruits of the species in Milligania than to the
greenish, drier drupes mostly present in Panke and G.
perpensa.
Just as in G. perpensa, individuals of G. macrophylla
from different parts of the Malayan area have some-
times been hypothesized to belong to different varie-
ties or species. For example, plants from Sumatra were
identiﬁed by van der Post in 1855 as different from
specimens from Java. Our study includes one specimen
from Sumatra and one from Java. These specimens
showed rbcL sequences of different length (Wanntorp
et al. 2001). The ITS sequences for these two speci-
mens, however, were identical.
Subgenus Milligania, the Species from New Zealand
and Tasmania. This subgenus includes all species
from New Zealand and G. cordifolia from Tasmania
which are characterized by small size and propagation
by stolons. The present study found four well-sup-
ported clades. G. monoica is well-supported as sister to
the remainder of Milligania. It has bisexual inﬂores-
cences carrying female ﬂowers basally and male ﬂow-
ers apically, and is in this respect similar to G. macro-
phylla. In contrast, the other New Zealand species, as
well as the Tasmanian G. cordifolia, have male and fe-
male ﬂowers on separate inﬂorescences.

The position of the Australian G. cordifolia, securely
nested among the New Zealand species, suggests a
comparatively late dispersal from New Zealand rather
than an ancient vicariance involving the Antarctic con-
tinent. If our hypothesis is correct, then the fossil Gun-
nera pollen recorded from upper Cretaceous Campan-
ian strata in Australia, ( Jarzen and Dettmann 1989)
must derive not from this species but from more dis-
tant relatives, possibly closer to G. macrophylla.
Subgenus Misandra, the Stoloniferous South Amer-
ican Species. South America is the area with the
highest diversity of Gunnera with representatives of
three different subgenera. Of these, subgenus Misandra
includes small-sized dioecious, perennial species that
spread by stolons. The shoot apex is protected by a
membranous hood or ochrea, a character that does not
occur in any other species of Gunnera. In most other
traits these species are quite similar to the species of
Milligania, however. Indeed, it was recently suggested
that these two subgenera are not clearly distinguish-
able on morphological grounds and could perhaps be
amalgamated (Wilkinson 2000).
Gunnera magellanica is the most widespread of all
South American Gunnera species and occurs from
Cape Horn and the Falkland Islands along the Andean
Cordillera to Colombia (Mora-Osejo 1984). Gunnera lob-
ata occurs in Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia. In the
former study (Wanntorp et al. 2001), Misandra was rep-
resented by G. magellanica only, which was placed in
an unresolved position with members of the subgenus
Panke. However, the analysis based on the single rps16
intron showed clear support for G. magellanica as close-
ly related to Panke. The ITS study revealed a close re-
lationship between G. lobata and G. magellanica. When
combining the three different gene regions, the group
formed by G. magellanica and G. lobata was found to be
the sister group to subgenus Panke. The phylogenetic
signal in the rbcL gene had obviously been comple-
mented by the ITS data.
Despite the general morphological similarity there is
no evidence for a close relationship between the sub-
genera Misandra and Milligania. Their inclusion in two
clearly separate clades is among the most well-sup-
ported results of the entire analysis. It seems reason-
able to conclude that stolons, which are the main unit-
ing character, may have been an ancestral feature in
Gunnera, possibly excluding G. perpensa and G. herteri.
Their absence in subgenus Panke, then, is due to a loss
of this means of vegetative dispersal.
Subgenus Panke, the Giants of the Cordilleras. The
Andean Cordilleras from Patagonia to Mexico in South
and Central America contain the highest species di-
versity of subgenus Panke, with at least 20 endemic
species, often allopatric and similar in morphology.
Outside the Andes, the two species of Gunnera from
Hawaii also belong in Panke as do the species from the

Juan Ferna´ ndez Islands. Gunnera brasiliensis is also dis-
junct from the rest of the subgenus, being restricted to
the Serra do Mar near the Atlantic coast in southern
Brazil. The difﬁcult demarcation of species and their
frequent hybridization (Palkovic 1978; Pacheco et al.
1991) indicate that speciation within Panke is still on-
going. It seems reasonable to connect at least most of
the diversiﬁcation of Panke with the uprising of the
Andes. This was initiated in the South, already during
the Cretaceous, while the Colombian Cordilleras in the
north are of Plio-Pleistocene age (Putzer 1968).
Neither the previous rbcL/rps16 intron analysis nor
the ITS study strongly supported the monophyly of
subgenus Panke, which morphologically is very clearly
deﬁned. Subgenus Panke are usually large plants with
ascending to erect polystelic rhizomes covered by large
often frilled scales, palmate leaves and huge com-
pound inﬂorescences. The well-supported association
of Misandra and Panke in our analysis, on the other
hand, has almost no support in morphological traits,
unless, as proposed by Skottsberg (1936), the ‘‘ochrea’’
of Misandra is indeed homologous to the large scales,
which are one of the distinguishing features of Panke.
As in the rbcL/rps16 intron analysis, the Hawaiian
species of subgenus Panke are the sister group of the
South American species, but now this relationship is
well-supported. Several Gunnera species have been de-
scribed from the Hawaiian islands (St. John 1946).
Though there seems to be considerable geographical
variation, the number has recently been reduced to the
two species included in this study, G. petaloidea and G.
kauaiensis (Wagner et al. 1990). The Hawaiian species
form a very well-supported clade.
The resolution within subgenus Panke was higher
than in the previous study, but the information in the
ITS region is still insufﬁcient to fully resolve the phy-
logeny of the American species. However, a signiﬁcant
result was the well-supported position of G. manicata
in the tree (Fig. 3) and its corroborated identity with
G. brasiliensis. There exists considerable confusion
about the identity and origin of the frequently culti-
vated G. manicata. This species is sometimes considered
to have been introduced from Brazil (Linden 1867; Ay-
res Fevereiro and Perazzo Barbosa 1976) and to be pos-
sibly identical to the wild G. brasiliensis (Schindler
1905). However, it has also been claimed to be of Col-
ombian origin (Mora-Osejo 1984). This study consti-
tutes a ﬁrst attempt to clarify the matter phylogeneti-
cally. The ITS region of a cultivated plant of G. manicata
of garden origin was sequenced as well as the ITS of
G. brasiliensis. These sequences were completely iden-
tical and the two specimens grouped together with
strong support.
Among the remaining species, those from the South
form a poorly supported clade. Among these, Gunnera
chilensis grows in mainland Chile. It is sister to G. mas-

afuerae, an endemic to Masafuera (the youngest, and
outermost, of the Juan Ferna´ ndez Islands). These two
species are the sister group of G. peltata and G. bracteata
which also appear as sister species. The latter two
grow on Masatierra (the inner and more ancient of the
Juan Ferna´ ndez Islands), where they form hybrids
(Skottsberg 1914, Pacheco et al. 1991). Generally these
four ITS sequences differ in very few base pairs. The
sequences from the morphologically quite distinct G.
peltata and G. bracteata were completely identical. The
Juan Ferna´ ndez Islands are only two to three million
years old (Stuessy et al. 1984), and the diversiﬁcation
of these species is likely to have taken place within this
time span.
In 1959, Macbride suggested that the Peruvian G.
bolivari could be closely related to G. bracteata based on
smaller leaf size and also on the glabrousness of these
plants. A phylogenetic study of the relationship of the
Juan Ferna´ ndez species was undertaken by Pacheco et
al. (1993). This was based on ﬂavonoids and morphol-
ogy and indicated that G. bolivari is more closely relat-
ed to other species such as G. mexicana and G. boliviana
than to G. bracteata. On the other hand, ﬂavonoid com-
pounds unique to G. chilensis and to the species from
Juan Ferna´ ndez Islands were identiﬁed. Based on mor-
phological as well as ﬂavonoid data they considered G.
chilensis to be the closest mainland relative of all the
Juan Ferna´ ndez species. In a phylogenetic analysis of
the relationship of the Juan Ferna´ ndez species they
chose G. chilensis as an outgroup. Gunnera masafuerae
was most closely related to G. peltata, but this clade
was supported by one morphological character only,
while the ﬂavonoid data were uninformative. The pre-
sent phylogenetic study for the ﬁrst time allows the
comparison of the species from the Juan Ferna´ ndez Is-
lands with species not only from Chile, but also from
Tropical South America, Central America and Hawaii.
The close relationship with G. chilensis suggested by
Pacheco et al. (1993) is supported (even though G. bo-
livari is not included in our analysis). The relationship
among the Juan Ferna´ ndez species, however, is in con-
ﬂict since in our analysis G. masafuerae is most closely
related to the mainland G. chilensis, rather than to G.
peltata from Masatierra. This indicates two separate col-
onizations of the Juan Fernandez Islands, one by the
ancestor of G. peltata/G. bracteata and the other by G.
masafuerae. More information is needed to resolve the
positions of G. pilosa from Equador, G. insignis from
Panama, and G. talamancana from Costa Rica.
The South American species of Panke show a high
degree of similarity, morphologically as well as in ITS
sequences, which could support a recent origin for this
part of the subgenus. If so, the late Cretaceous ﬁndings
of Gunnera pollen ( Jarzen and Dettmann 1989), as well
as putative macrofossils of leaves attributed to subge-
nus Panke (Wilkinson 2000) from North America comes

SYSTEMATIC BOTANY

into new light. If Panke, including the Hawaiian spe-
cies, is of southern origin, a late diversiﬁcation seems
to rule out the possibility that the North American fos-
sils could belong to this clade. If these fossils, on the
other hand, truly represent Panke, a quite different and
more complicated history for Gunnera may be envi-
sioned, involving colonization of South America also
from the north. This scenario is in agreement with the
basal position of the Hawaiian species. While few or
no other close South American relatives of Hawaiian
species are known, a relationship between North
America and Hawaii is a well-known biogeographic
feature (Skottsberg 1936; Vargas et al. 1998).
