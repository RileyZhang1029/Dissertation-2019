We conducted ﬁeld experiments manipulating lichens, shrubs, and herbs along a time-since-ﬁre gradient and assessing
effects on three endemic herbaceous species of Florida scrub: Eryngium cuneifolium, Hypericum cumulicola, and Polygonella
basiramia. Responses included seed germination, survival, biomass, and fecundity. Transplants into recently burned patches
generally had higher survival, larger biomass, and greater reproductive output than transplants into long-unburned patches.
Open areas and sites near oaks frequently were more favorable than sites near Florida rosemary. Ground lichens did not
affect germination but increased mortality rate of seedlings. Neighboring small shrubby and herbaceous species did not
affect the performance of these species. Of the three species, naturally occurring E. cuneifolium were farthest from large
shrubs, and their microhabitats had the least ground lichens and shrubs. Eryngium cuneifolium and H. cumulicola are capable
of forming persistent seed banks and their recruitment after ﬁre depends mostly on these dormant seeds. Polygonella
basiramia relies on seed dispersal and immediate seed germination to colonize recently burned patches. Management for
these species should involve variable ﬁre regimes to allow all three species to persist along with many other scrub endemics.

Fire is a major evolutionary and ecological force in
many plant communities (e.g., Gill, 1975; Forman and
Boerner, 1981; Christensen, 1985; Abrams, 1992; Whe-
lan, 1995). The mechanisms proposed to explain ﬁre ef-
fects on plant species include soil heating and burning,
removal of competitors, and elimination of predators and
herbivores (Tyler, 1996, and references therein). Short-
term effects of ﬁre on seed dormancy, germination, and
establishment promote emergence because of changes in
soil structure, nutrient levels, or allelochemics. Long-term
effects of ﬁre on resource availability and aboveground
biomass create opportunities for recruitment and growth
(Tyler and D’ Antonio, 1995; Tyler, 1995, 1996).
Understanding life history traits and ecological attri-
butes limiting species abundance and range is necessary
for improved land management. Comparative approaches

among co-occurring or related species can offer insights
on limiting factors (e.g., Rabinowitz and Rapp, 1981;
Fiedler, 1987; Prober, 1992; Byers and Meagher, 1997).
Fire return intervals, ﬁre intensity, and seasons of burn
may affect species viability (Burgman and Lamont, 1992;
Bradstock et al., 1996; Menges and Dolan, 1998; Enright
et al., 1998). If species respond differentially to changes
produced by different ﬁre regimes, then trade-offs among
species should be considered in management decisions.
Land managers need to discern these trade-offs and make
decisions to manage for mixtures of species or for par-
ticularly critical species.
The Florida scrub is a ﬁre-maintained, shrubby asso-
ciation ranging from open communities dominated by
Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides) to dense stands of
dwarf oaks (e.g., Quercus inopina, Q. chapmanii, and Q.
geminata; Abrahamson and Abrahamson, 1996, Menges,
1998; nomenclature follows Wunderlin, 1998). Eryngium
cuneifolium, Hypericum cumulicola, and Polygonella
basiramia are perennial herbs nearly restricted to this
community (Menges, 1998). These and other herbaceous
species concentrate in gaps among shrubs where their
density decreases with ground lichen cover (Abrahamson
et al., 1984; Hawkes and Menges, 1996). Preliminary ev-
idence suggests that their population dynamics is asso-
ciated with periodic ﬁres and the subsequent availability
of open space that may reduce competition (Abrahamson,
1984; Johnson and Abrahamson, 1990; Hawkes and
Menges, 1995; Menges and Kimmich, 1996; Quintana-
Ascencio and Morales-Herna´ ndez, 1997). The distribu-
tion and demography of these species in different habitats
suggest that they may have contrasting competitive abil-
ities and gap size requirements. Eryngium cuneifolium
has the most limited range and is restricted to large open-
ings between shrubs (Menges and Kimmich, 1996). Hy-

pericum cumulicola has a wider distribution and can be
found in intermediate size gaps. Their demographic per-
formance is best shortly after ﬁre (Menges and Kimmich,
1996; Quintana-Ascencio and Morales-Herna´ ndez, 1997).
The higher incidence of E. cuneifolium and H. cumulicola
in larger and more aggregated Florida rosemary scrub
patches suggests their limited dispersal (Quintana-Ascen-
cio and Menges, 1996). Polygonella basiramia, the most
widespread species, grows in both large and small gaps
in Florida scrub patches.
This study compares the effects of competition and ﬁre
on demographic responses of these three perennial herb
species. The responses of seeds, seedlings, transplants,
and established focal plants were examined in relation to
variation in time since ﬁre, lichen cover, and the impor-
tance of co-occurring herbs and shrubs, through a series
of ﬁeld experiments (Table 1).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study species—The snakeroot E. cuneifolium Small (Apiaceae), The
Highlands scrub hypericum H. cumulicola (Small) P. Adams (Hyperi-
caceae), and the wireweed P. basiramia (Small) Nesom and Bates (Po-
lygonaceae) are narrowly endemic to central Florida (Christman and
Judd, 1990). These are short-lived, nonclonal, perennial herbaceous spe-
cies with basal vegetative stems. All develop erect and branched repro-
ductive stalks. Eryngium cuneifolium and H. cumulicola are bisexual
and self compatible, and P. basiramia is gynodioecious (Menges and
Yahr, 1998). Hypericum cumulicola and P. basiramia are obligate seed-
ers, while E. cuneifolium can rarely resprout after ﬁre (Menges and
Kohfeldt, 1995). Seeds of E. cuneifolium (⬃1–2 mm wide) are at least
2– 4 times larger than H. cumulicola seeds or P. basiramia achenes.
Eryngium cuneifolium and H. cumulicola appear to disperse by gravity
and have limited dispersal distances (⬍2 m; Menges et al., 1998). In
contrast, the persistent calyxes of the achenes of P. basiramia appear
to be adapted for wind dispersal.

Study sites—We established ﬁeld experiments at The Nature Con-
servancy’s Lake Apthorpe Preserve (Apthorpe) and at Archbold Bio-
logical Station (Archbold). Both sites are located in the southern part
of the Lake Wales Ridge, Florida, and are characterized by a mosaic of
Florida scrub, ﬂatwoods, and seasonal ponds (Abrahamson et al., 1984;
Menges, 1998; Menges and Hawkes, 1998). Our study sites included
three recently burned and three long-unburned rosemary scrub patches.
This is a particularly open and xeric type of Florida scrub restricted to
well-drained white sands (Abrahamson et al., 1984; Menges and Haw-
kes, 1998; Menges, 1998). Prescribed ﬁres were applied in April 1994

at Apthorpe, and in September 1993 and May 1995 at Archbold (Kevin
Main and Steve Shatler, personal communication). The three long un-
burned scrub patches have been without ﬁre for at least 20 yr, but
include some large openings of bare sand.

Seed germination, ﬁre, and lichens (experiment 1)—We sowed
seeds of the focal species with and without ground lichens in recently
and long-unburned patches. We collected up to four mature fruits of E.
cuneifolium, H. cumulicola, and P. basiramia from individual plants.
Fruits were opened in the laboratory and examined under the micro-
scope to select seeds without signs of damage or deformation. The seeds
were temporarily stored in aluminum foil within labeled paper bags.
We placed 20 triplets of wire mesh cages (one cage per species; 20
⫻ 20 ⫻ 4 cm with 0.6 cm mesh) every 5 m along random transects in
recently burned rosemary scrub and in available gaps at least 1 m from
the closest Florida rosemary in long-unburned rosemary scrub. Within
each triplet, seeds of each species were placed in their own cage (E.
cuneifolium, 20 fruits, November 1995; H. cumulicola, 80 seeds, July
and September 1995, sown twice to mimic its longer fruiting season;
P. basiramia, 40 fruits, December 1995). In half of the cages, we added
a 3 cm width thallus fragment from each of the two most common
ground lichen genera at the study sites, Cladonia spp. (mostly C. le-
porina) and Cladina spp. (mostly C. evansii). Seeds were deposited on
the ground inside partially buried dark green plastic pots (13 ⫻ 11 ⫻
5 cm pots without bottoms for drainage) within the cages, and watered
once. We also placed two control groups of each species outdoors on
ﬁlter paper within a petri dish and followed their germination for 4 mo.
Seeds, seedlings, and other biological material for all our experiments
were not transferred among sites. Response variables were percentage
germination and subsequent seedling survival.
Log-linear models were employed to compare differences in the pro-
portion of cages with germinated seeds (P) among sites (S), ﬁre (B),
and lichen treatments (L). The signiﬁcance of an interaction was mea-
sured relative to the model to which it was added. We used BLS,P as
‘‘null model,’’ assuming that this table reﬂects treatment distribution of
the cages and the frequency of cages with seedlings, but this frequency
is independent of site, ﬁre, and lichens (Fienberg, 1987). We used
Mann-Whitney U tests to examine seedling number variation among
the same treatments.

Effects of shrubs on transplanted plants (experiment 2)—We trans-
planted E. cuneifolium, H. cumulicola, and P. basiramia to microsites
in the center of open sandy areas and in the proximity of dominant
shrub species. We used Florida rosemary scrub patches with different
ﬁre histories and protected some plants from large herbivores.

Culture, transplantation, and plant measurements—We germinated E.
cuneifolium, H. cumulicola, and P. basiramia seeds on humid ﬁlter

paper in petri dishes and transplanted 2–5 d old seedlings to plastic
bags (⬃250 mL [8 oz] disposable baby feeding bottles) with local soil
(see Table 1). The seedlings were watered as needed, kept under 40 W
ﬂuorescent lamps (F40 agrolite, 1600 lumens) in a unheated greenhouse,
and later transplanted to the ﬁeld. We also excavated 100 P. basiramia
juveniles (before they developed reproductive stems) from each site
between 26 September and 2 October 1995. We used a 20 ⫻ 6 cm PVC
(polyvinyl chloride) tube and a mallet to unearth the plants. The sand
cylinder with the plant was transferred to a plastic bag (⬃250 mL dis-
posable baby feeding bottles), watered, and kept in a greenhouse until
transplanting. All plants were transplanted to the ﬁeld in April 1996
except P. basiramia juveniles in February 1996. We made holes with
a soil auger (8 cm wide) to receive the transplants and removed litter,
ground lichens, and plants within a 10 cm radius. Plants were watered
once after transplant (⬃0.5 L).
We measured height and branch length (or cover) at the time of
transplanting and height, branch length (or cover), reproductive status,
survival, and damage by large herbivores monthly until November
1996. Fecundity (number of ﬂowers and fruits for H. cumulicola and
number of clusters for P. basiramia) was evaluated in July, October,
and November 1996. Plants were removed from the soil in November
1996, dried (Fisher Isotemp Oven Senior Model/Forced draft, Gottin-
gen, Germany) for 48 h, and weighed (Sartorious scale model 1264;
0.01 g). There were no signiﬁcant differences in height and branch
length (or cover) at transplant time among individuals of the same spe-
cies in contrasting microhabitats within sites, except for the height of
H. cumulicola transplanted in Apthorpe (F ⫽ 2.62, P ⫽ 0.043, df 4,
68).

Experiment 2a: plants without cages—We transplanted E. cuneifol-
ium (N ⫽ 6, 5, 7, 8, 7, 6, 7, habitat order as in Figs. 1 and 2), and H.
cumulicola (N ⫽ 17, 18, 15, 13, 15, 15, 15) seedlings and P. basiramia
juveniles (N ⫽ 16, 18, 15, 13, 8, 8, 11, 15, 15, 16) unprotected from
large herbivores to ﬁve experimental microsites resulting from combi-
nations of two different levels of time-since-ﬁre (recently burned and
long-unburned patches) and three microhabitats deﬁned by shrub dis-
tance and shrub species (Florida rosemary height ⫽ 119.9 ⫾ 46.4 cm
[mean and standard deviation]; Quercus spp. height ⫽ 78.8 ⫾ 29.6 cm,
and 97.3 ⫾ 39.6 cm in time since ﬁre, respectively). Microhabitats
adjacent to shrubs were shaded part of the day. We used three microsites
near the southern end of natural gaps: (1) open habitat—1 m away from
any oak canopy and 2 m from any Florida rosemary canopy; (2) near
oak—below the drip line of the northern margin of an oak canopy
bordering an open area; and (3) near Florida rosemary—below the drip
line of the northern margin of the canopy of a Florida rosemary bor-
dering an open area. These three treatments were not applied to E.
cuneifolium and H. cumulicola in the long-unburned area at Archbold.
We used only two microsites in recently burned patches: (1) open sites;
(2) near oak. Recently burned patches contained only seedlings of Flor-
ida rosemary. We distributed transplants randomly among treatments
within sites. One individual of each species was included in a replicated
triplet (except as indicated), 20 cm apart from each other focal plant in
each microhabitat studied. Final sample size was reduced by exclusion
of plants disturbed by animals (probably raccoons).

Experiment 2b: seedlings inside cages—We transplanted seedlings of
E. cuneifolium (N ⫽ 13, 14, habitat order as in Fig. 4), H. cumulicola
(N ⫽ 14, 13), and P. basiramia (N ⫽ 10, 13) into microsites protected
from large herbivores. We chose two microhabitats in Florida rosemary
scrub patches at Archbold: (1) open habitat in a recently burned patch,

approximately every 5 m along two random transects, at least 2 m from
the nearest oak; and (2) near Florida rosemary in a long-unburned patch,
below the drip line of the northern margin of the shrub canopy border-
ing an open area. We distributed transplants randomly (one individual
of each species per group) and 20 cm from every other focal plant.
Each group of plants was enclosed in a wire mesh cage (46 ⫻ 46 ⫻ 40
cm and 0.6 cm mesh).
Contingency tables and G tests were used to compare differences in
survival of transplants between shrub treatments. We described growth
variation within species only in terms of biomass because of the high
correlation between size variables (r 2 ⫽ 0.63–0.82, P ⬍ 0.001 in every
case). The signiﬁcance of differences in ﬁnal aboveground biomass (nat-
ural-log transformed) among transplants in different microhabitats was
evaluated with analysis of variance for H. cumulicola and P. basiramia.
An exact randomization test was employed for E. cuneifolium biomass
data because of its small sample sizes (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981). The
effect of ﬁre and microhabitat on total number of reproductive structures
(using height as a covariate) was assessed using analysis of covariance.

Effect of experimental removal of neighbors (experiment 3)—We
evaluated the effect of neighboring herbaceous and small shrub species
around 20 naturally occurring focal individuals of each of our study
species per site. Plants were selected in a stratiﬁed random fashion,
along the center of randomly located 2 m wide belt transects. We com-
pared naturally occurring H. cumulicola individuals in a recently burned
rosemary scrub patch with those in a long-unburned scrub patch, at
Archbold and Apthorpe. We studied P. basiramia from the same long-
unburned scrub patches, but this species was not present in recently
burned patches. Eryngium cuneifolium was examined in the same re-
cently burned scrub at Apthorpe and at the border of a rosemary scrub
at Archbold. We removed all plants and ground lichens within 30 cm
of half of all focal plants in June 1995 and January and June 1996. We
counted number of stems and total number of reproductive structures
(ﬂowering stalks of P. basiramia) and measured height and total branch
length of each focal H. cumulicola and P. basiramia, and maximum
width and its perpendicular width for each E. cuneifolium.
We counted and identiﬁed all rooted plant species, recorded the pres-

ence of ground lichens within 15 cm of studied individuals, measured
the distance of every individual to the nearest oak and Florida rosemary,
and measured the height of these shrubs. We used Detrended Corre-
spondence Analysis in PC-ORD (McCune, 1993) to depict multivariate
changes in dominance of species neighborhoods for each focal species
in recently burned and long-unburned sites.

RESULTS

Seed germination, ﬁre, and lichens (experiment 1)—
Germination and soil seed dynamics were different
among the three study species. Seed germination was
highest for P. basiramia. Most (⬎95%) seeds of P. bas-
iramia in the control petri dishes germinated during the
ﬁrst 4 d following their placement outdoors. However,
after ⬃120 d, only 20 – 40% H. cumulicola seeds and 5–
20% E. cuneifolium seeds in the petri dishes germinated.
In the ﬁeld, seeds started germinating by December 1995.
Polygonella basiramia seedlings were present in most of
the cages within 1 mo of sowing, and between 12 and
45% of them remained alive after 14 mo (Table 2). By
January 1996, H. cumulicola seedlings occurred in ⬍30%
of cages and no more new seedlings of these species were
found after March 1996. Hypericum cumulicola seedling
survival was generally low. We did not ﬁnd any seedlings
of E. cuneifolium during the ﬁrst 9 mo, but a few seed-
lings germinated between December 1996 and January
1997, a year after sowing (Table 2).
Site and lichen presence affected P. basiramia. The
proportion of cages with P. basiramia seeds germinated
(Table 2) and ﬁnal seedling number per cage (z ⫽ ⫺2.11;
P ⫽ 0.03) were higher in Apthorpe than Archbold. Nei-
ther ﬁre history nor presence of ground lichens affected
the proportion of cages with P. basiramia seeds germi-
nated. Final seedling number was higher in cages without
lichens than with lichens in both sites but only statisti-

We could not analyze the responses of E. cuneifolium and
H. cumulicola seeds and seedlings to the presence of
ground lichens, ﬁre history, or site because of their low
germination rates (Table 2).

Effects of shrubs on transplanted plants (experiments
2a and 2b)—The effects of ﬁre and shrub presence on
survival differed among the three study species. Survival
of E. cuneifolium and H. cumulicola transplanted without
cages was signiﬁcantly higher in recently burned patches
than in long-unburned patches at Apthorpe (Fig. 1; G ⫽
3.94, 1 df, P ⫽ 0.047 for E. cuneifolium; G ⫽ 9.73, 1
df, P ⫽ 0.002 for H. cumulicola). We found no signiﬁcant
survival differences for E. cuneifolium and H. cumulicola

open), nor any signiﬁcant effects of ﬁre or microhabitat
on P. basiramia survival in either site (Fig. 1; P ⬎ 0.15
for any test). Survival rates were fairly high for trans-
plants in most treatments (Fig. 1).
Fire or shrub presence differentially affected ﬁnal bio-
mass of all three study species. Final biomass of surviv-
ing E. cuneifolium transplants in Apthorpe was higher
near oaks in recently burned patches than in any other
microhabitat (Fig. 2; P ⫽ 0.028, randomization test). Fi-
nal biomass of surviving H. cumulicola transplants was
higher in the burned area at Apthorpe, but no signiﬁcant
differences were found due to shrub microhabitat (Fig. 2;
Table 3). Polygonella basiramia transplants in Apthorpe
and near oaks and in open habitats had higher ﬁnal bio-
mass (Fig. 2; Table 3).
Fecundity also varied by treatment. The number of re-
productive structures was larger in open burned habitats
for H. cumulicola in Apthorpe (Fig. 3; Table 3). Poly-
gonella basiramia transplanted to the recently burned
patch in Apthorpe had higher fecundity than those trans-
planted to the long-unburned patch (Fig. 3; signiﬁcant
interaction S ⫻ F in Table 3) but we did not ﬁnd any

signiﬁcant differences in Archbold (Fig. 3). The Poly-
gonella basiramia gender ratio was not signiﬁcantly het-
erogeneous inside treatments (39 females and 32 her-
maphrodites; G ⫽ 1.47, 4 df, P ⫽ 0.831). Transplanted
E. cuneifolium did not ﬂower during the study interval.
We found evidence of herbivory on E. cuneifolium, H.
cumulicola, and P. basiramia throughout the study peri-
od. Many damaged plants were clipped to the base.
After 7 mo, the three species protected inside cages
had lower performance when transplanted near Florida
rosemary in the long-unburned patch than in the open
habitat of the recently burned patch, but they varied in
the strength of their response. Survival of E. cuneifolium
was signiﬁcantly lower than that of P. basiramia and H.
cumulicola in both patch types (Fig. 4; G ⫽ 7.60, 2 df,
P ⫽ 0.022 and G ⫽ 7.52, 2 df, P ⫽ 0.023 in recently
and long-unburned patches, respectively). Survival with-
in species was not signiﬁcantly different among patches.
Final biomass was lower near rosemary in the long-un-
burned patch than in the open area of the recently burned
patch for each of the three species (Fig. 4; Table 4). By
the end of the trial P. basiramia reached higher biomass
than H. cumulicola, which was heavier than E. cuneifol-
ium (Fig. 4; Table 4). Hypericum cumulicola and P. bas-
iramia transplanted near rosemary in the long-unburned
patch ﬂowered later and had lower reproductive output
and reproductive effort than those in the recently burned
patch (Figs. 3, 5; Table 4). Eryngium cuneifolium did not
ﬂower during the experiment.

(experiment 3)—After 12 mo, ⬍20% of target H. cu-
mulicola and E. cuneifolium died, but 50 –80% (by site
and microhabitat combination) of P. basiramia perished.
Reproductive effort (number of ﬂowers and fruits/height)

of focal H. cumulicola in June 1996 (the beginning of
reproductive season) was not signiﬁcantly different be-
tween site, time since ﬁre, or removal treatments (any P

tures on any focal E. cuneifolium or P. basiramia.

Analysis of microhabitat characteristics—We found E.
cuneifolium, H. cumulicola, and P. basiramia in contrast-
ing locations on gradients of distance to shrubs, presence
of lichens, and neighbor ﬂoristic composition and abun-
dance. In long-unburned patches, P. basiramia occurred
closer to oaks and rosemary than H. cumulicola (Fig. 6).
In recently burned patches (which lacked P. basiramia),
H. cumulicola occurred closer to oaks than E. cuneifolium
(Fig. 6).
Ground lichens were present in 60 –75% of the neigh-
borhoods of P. basiramia and H. cumulicola in long un-
burned patches, but in ⬍20% of E. cuneifolium. Fewer
than 30% of the neighborhoods of H. cumulicola and E.
cuneifolium had ground lichens in the patches 2–3 yr
postﬁre.
We found ⬎30 species in the study species’ neighbor-
hoods, including grasses, forbs, and shrubs. Conspeciﬁcs
were frequent in the neighborhoods of the focal species.

herbaceous species common in open areas, were the most
frequent neighbor species. Neighborhood species richness
and abundance were highest for E. cuneifolium and low-
est for P. basiramia.
There were signiﬁcant effects of study site and focal
species on scores of the ﬁrst axes of the neighbor ﬂoristic
gradients detected by DECORANA ordination (eigenval-
ue 0.817, N ⫽ 294; Table 5). The neighborhoods of E.
cuneifolium were subsets of the neighborhoods for the
other two species and grouped in the lower left portion
of the cloud of points in the space deﬁned by the ﬁrst
two axes of the ordination (Fig. 7). This portion of the
graph was mostly characterized by herbaceous species
and a few common shrubs (Opuntia humifusa and Pa-
lafoxia feayii). The neighbors of P. basiramia and H.
cumulicola overlapped considerably and had a wider dis-
tribution in the ordination space.

DISCUSSION

Understanding the relative importance of direct and in-
direct ﬁre effects on postﬁre responses of herbaceous spe-
cies is central for wise management (e.g., Tyler, 1996,
and references therein). Demographic variation in re-
sponse to changes in shrub and lichen cover importance
may help to explain the contrasting distribution of Eryn-
gium cuneifolium, Hypericum cumulicola and Polygonel-
la basiramia along a time-since-ﬁre gradient. Observed
species patterns were concordant with their differential

QUINTANA-ASCENCIO AND MENGES—THREE ENDEMIC SPECIES ALONG A FIRE GRADIENT

sensitivity to ﬁre, presence or absence of gaps and patch
size. Polygonella basiramia survival and biomass were
least affected by time since ﬁre, but its seedlings showed
increasing mortality near ground lichens. Previous work
found P. basiramia natural densities were unrelated to
time since ﬁre but sensitive to the amount of open sand
(Hawkes and Menges, 1995). The lower survival and bio-
mass of transplanted H. cumulicola and E. cuneifolium
in long-unburned paches were similar to that found in
naturally occurring populations (Menges and Kimmich,
1996; Quintana-Ascencio and Morales Herna´ ndez, 1997).
A 10-yr study of E. cuneifolium populations documented
their extinction in Florida rosemary scrub patches be-
tween 20 and 30 yr postﬁre (Menges and Yahr, 1998).
Mortality in H. cumulicola is lowest shortly after ﬁre,
although subsequent patterns are more complex (Quin-
tana-Ascencio, 1997). Overall mortality rates were higher
for P. basiramia than for the other species, consistent
with demographic differences seen in long-term studies
(Menges and Kimmich, 1996; Quintana-Ascencio and
Morales-Herna´ ndez, 1997; Menges, unpublished data).
The analysis of microhabitats that is part of this study
provides additional detail on the microsites within gaps
where these three species can grow. Eryngium cuneifol-
ium appears more sensitive to gaps (Menges and Kim-
mich, 1996), its microhabitats were farther from large
shrubs, less covered by lichens, and ﬂoristically charac-
terized by more herbaceous and fewer shrub species than
the other two species. Polygonella basiramia requires
only small gaps and can even persist in the small, rather
ephemeral gaps of scrubby ﬂatwoods (Young and Men-
ges, 1999).
Because there are predictable changes in rosemary
community structure as the sites age between ﬁres (Haw-
kes and Menges, 1996), the explanations based on ﬁre
and gaps are complementary. As rosemary sites age, the
cover of lichens and the abundance of large shrubs in-
crease (Menges and Kohlfeldt, 1995). Growth of shrubs,
especially Florida rosemary, decreases gap sizes and area
(Hawkes and Menges, 1996). As gaps shrink, microhab-
itats become less favorable ﬁrst for E. cuneifolium, later
for H. cumulicola, and ﬁnally for P. basiramia.
What makes postﬁre environments and open gaps so
critical for E. cuneifolium and H. cumulicola? There are
at least seven possible and nonmutually exclusive hy-
potheses (modiﬁed from Sousa, 1984). These involve
competition from large shrubs, competition from small
shrubs and herbs, competition from ground lichens, com-
petition from the cryptobiotic soil crust, direct effects of
ﬁre, differential herbivory, and seed dormancy and ger-
mination.
This study addresses many of these hypotheses, al-
though not all the answers are clear. Herbaceous species
in unburned sites often survive at higher rates after shrub
removal or trenching to reduce their root competition
(e.g., Swank and Oechel, 1991; Tyler, 1996). In our
study, large shrubs that border the gap appear to have
differential effects depending on the shrub species.
Neighboring oaks in recently burned patches facilitate the
growth of transplants. However, neighboring rosemary
shrubs often were associated with the slowest growth
rates of our study species. Since Florida rosemary is
killed by ﬁre and has only small seedlings in recently

burned sites, its effects are difﬁcult to completely sepa-
rate from the effects of ﬁre per se. In natural populations,
rosemary shrub presence, size, and distance proved to be
among the most important factors predicting demograph-
ic performance of E. cuneifolium (Menges and Kimmich,
1996) and H. cumulicola (Quintana-Ascencio and Mo-
rales-Herna´ ndez, 1997). The mechanisms could involve
allelochemicals that affect germination of other species
(Williamson, Obee, and Weidenhamer, 1992).
On the other hand, there were no signiﬁcant effects of
small shrubs and herbs within the gaps on the perfor-
mance of transplants in this study. This is consistent with
their lack of effects on naturally occurring E. cuneifolium
(Menges and Kimmich, 1996), H. cumulicola (Quintana-
Ascencio and Morales-Herna´ ndez, 1997), and P. basi-
ramia (Hawkes and Menges, 1995).
This study provides some weak evidence that ground
lichens can affect the early stages in the life cycle of
herbaceous species. Lichens increased seedling mortality
in P. basiramia and resulted in lower seedling densities
in H. cumulicola in these experiments. In community
plots in rosemary scrub, seedling recruitment was in-
creased by lichen removal (Menges and Hawkes, unpub-
lished data). Biotic soil crusts could also affect germi-
nation and nutrient cycling and may interact with lichens
as well (Lawrey, 1986; Bever, Westover and Antonovics,
1997; Hawkes, unpublished data).
Fire may have direct effects that are not reﬂected in
changes in community structure, including heating of the
soil, release or combustion of nutrients, smoke produc-
tion, and volatilization of allelochemics (McPherson and
Muller, 1969; Christensen and Muller, 1975b; Keeley and
Keeley, 1987; Tyler, 1996; Keeley and Fotheringham,
1998). Nutrient addition experiments at Archbold suggest
that community responses in scrubby ﬂatwoods are not
strongly tied to any postﬁre nutrient ﬂush (Dawn Berry,
unpublished data), but phosphorus fertilization mimicked
ﬁre effects on ﬂowering for one of two populations of an
herb growing on xeric sandhill soils in Florida (Brewer,
1995). Nutrient addition alone did not affect survival of
herbs in an unburned chaparral (Swank and Oechel,
1991). Heating experiments on seeds of some scrub spe-
cies have not demonstrated any signiﬁcant effects on ger-
mination percentages (Menges, unpublished data). The
fact that the transplant experiments in this study occurred
after ﬁres, yet had qualitatively similar patterns to natural
populations affected by ﬁre, suggests that direct effects
of ﬁre do not account for most of the postﬁre patterns
seen.
Herbivores can affect postﬁre plant survival (Christen-
sen and Muller, 1975a; Swank and Oechel, 1991; Tyler,
1996). In this study, herbivory was quite variable in space
and time and does not seem consistent with being the
major force differentiating early postﬁre and unburned
environments, nor explaining the different positions of
the three study species on a postﬁre gradient. However,
herbivory in Florida scrub remains little studied.
Seed dormancy and germination are clearly important
components of these species’ life histories, and our stud-
ies have garnered some important information in this re-
gard. Polygonella basiramia is the only one of these three
species not to possess a persistent seed bank, according
to our experiments. These results are consistent with its

lack of germination from rosemary scrub soil samples
(Kohfeldt and Menges, unpublished data). In contrast, E.
cuneifolium and H. cumulicola delay some seed germi-
nation and are capable of forming a persistent seed bank,
with germination occurring after ﬁre. Again, this is con-
sistent with a community seed bank survey (Kohfeldt and
Menges, unpublished data) and results of experimental
burial of H. cumulicola seeds (Quintana-Ascencio, Dolan
and Menges, 1998).
Patterns of natural seedling appearance in relation to
ﬁre are also consistent with our experiments. Seedlings
of H. cumulicola and E. cuneifolium appear within a year
of ﬁre, sometimes in large numbers. Polygonella basi-
ramia seedlings appear more gradually within a few years
of ﬁre. This species must be recruiting from seeds dis-
persed from unburned patches, which are common in
rosemary scrub (Main and Menges, 1997). Of the three
species, P. basiramia appears best dispersed. Perhaps as
a consequence of this better dispersal as well as the abil-
ity to use small patches in the surrounding scrubby ﬂat-
woods matrix, P. basiramia is the only species of the
three not to exhibit patterns of site occupancy consistent
with metapopulation dynamics (Quintana-Ascencio and
Menges, 1996).
These results have several implications for manage-
ment. First, prescribed ﬁre is a useful tool in controlling
the competitive effects of large shrubs and lichens on
these herbaceous plants and in providing opportunities
for seedling recruitment. Since each species differs from
the others in its range of postﬁre tolerance, microsite
preferences, and tolerance to competition, variable ﬁre
frequencies and spatially patchy ﬁre intensities are most
likely to retain all three species in the landscape. Variable
ﬁre frequencies will also beneﬁt other endangered species
with different requirements. Patchy ﬁres will beneﬁt P.
basiramia in particular, since it requires dispersal from
unburned patches. However, patchy ﬁres may also be an
advantage to the other two species by allowing recolo-
nization of gaps from small, unburned patches. Variable
and patchy ﬁres are the environmental milieu within
which these scrub species evolved and are likely the best
conditions for maintainance of biodiversity and popula-
tion viability.

We conducted ﬁeld experiments manipulating lichens, shrubs, and herbs along a time-since-ﬁre gradient and assessing
effects on three endemic herbaceous species of Florida scrub: Eryngium cuneifolium, Hypericum cumulicola, and Polygonella
basiramia. Responses included seed germination, survival, biomass, and fecundity. Transplants into recently burned patches
generally had higher survival, larger biomass, and greater reproductive output than transplants into long-unburned patches.
Open areas and sites near oaks frequently were more favorable than sites near Florida rosemary. Ground lichens did not
affect germination but increased mortality rate of seedlings. Neighboring small shrubby and herbaceous species did not
affect the performance of these species. Of the three species, naturally occurring E. cuneifolium were farthest from large
shrubs, and their microhabitats had the least ground lichens and shrubs. Eryngium cuneifolium and H. cumulicola are capable
of forming persistent seed banks and their recruitment after ﬁre depends mostly on these dormant seeds. Polygonella
basiramia relies on seed dispersal and immediate seed germination to colonize recently burned patches. Management for
these species should involve variable ﬁre regimes to allow all three species to persist along with many other scrub endemics.

Fire is a major evolutionary and ecological force in
many plant communities (e.g., Gill, 1975; Forman and
Boerner, 1981; Christensen, 1985; Abrams, 1992; Whe-
lan, 1995). The mechanisms proposed to explain ﬁre ef-
fects on plant species include soil heating and burning,
removal of competitors, and elimination of predators and
herbivores (Tyler, 1996, and references therein). Short-
term effects of ﬁre on seed dormancy, germination, and
establishment promote emergence because of changes in
soil structure, nutrient levels, or allelochemics. Long-term
effects of ﬁre on resource availability and aboveground
biomass create opportunities for recruitment and growth
(Tyler and D’ Antonio, 1995; Tyler, 1995, 1996).
Understanding life history traits and ecological attri-
butes limiting species abundance and range is necessary
for improved land management. Comparative approaches

among co-occurring or related species can offer insights
on limiting factors (e.g., Rabinowitz and Rapp, 1981;
Fiedler, 1987; Prober, 1992; Byers and Meagher, 1997).
Fire return intervals, ﬁre intensity, and seasons of burn
may affect species viability (Burgman and Lamont, 1992;
Bradstock et al., 1996; Menges and Dolan, 1998; Enright
et al., 1998). If species respond differentially to changes
produced by different ﬁre regimes, then trade-offs among
species should be considered in management decisions.
Land managers need to discern these trade-offs and make
decisions to manage for mixtures of species or for par-
ticularly critical species.
The Florida scrub is a ﬁre-maintained, shrubby asso-
ciation ranging from open communities dominated by
Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides) to dense stands of
dwarf oaks (e.g., Quercus inopina, Q. chapmanii, and Q.
geminata; Abrahamson and Abrahamson, 1996, Menges,
1998; nomenclature follows Wunderlin, 1998). Eryngium
cuneifolium, Hypericum cumulicola, and Polygonella
basiramia are perennial herbs nearly restricted to this
community (Menges, 1998). These and other herbaceous
species concentrate in gaps among shrubs where their
density decreases with ground lichen cover (Abrahamson
et al., 1984; Hawkes and Menges, 1996). Preliminary ev-
idence suggests that their population dynamics is asso-
ciated with periodic ﬁres and the subsequent availability
of open space that may reduce competition (Abrahamson,
1984; Johnson and Abrahamson, 1990; Hawkes and
Menges, 1995; Menges and Kimmich, 1996; Quintana-
Ascencio and Morales-Herna´ ndez, 1997). The distribu-
tion and demography of these species in different habitats
suggest that they may have contrasting competitive abil-
ities and gap size requirements. Eryngium cuneifolium
has the most limited range and is restricted to large open-
ings between shrubs (Menges and Kimmich, 1996). Hy-

pericum cumulicola has a wider distribution and can be
found in intermediate size gaps. Their demographic per-
formance is best shortly after ﬁre (Menges and Kimmich,
1996; Quintana-Ascencio and Morales-Herna´ ndez, 1997).
The higher incidence of E. cuneifolium and H. cumulicola
in larger and more aggregated Florida rosemary scrub
patches suggests their limited dispersal (Quintana-Ascen-
cio and Menges, 1996). Polygonella basiramia, the most
widespread species, grows in both large and small gaps
in Florida scrub patches.
This study compares the effects of competition and ﬁre
on demographic responses of these three perennial herb
species. The responses of seeds, seedlings, transplants,
and established focal plants were examined in relation to
variation in time since ﬁre, lichen cover, and the impor-
tance of co-occurring herbs and shrubs, through a series
of ﬁeld experiments (Table 1).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study species—The snakeroot E. cuneifolium Small (Apiaceae), The
Highlands scrub hypericum H. cumulicola (Small) P. Adams (Hyperi-
caceae), and the wireweed P. basiramia (Small) Nesom and Bates (Po-
lygonaceae) are narrowly endemic to central Florida (Christman and
Judd, 1990). These are short-lived, nonclonal, perennial herbaceous spe-
cies with basal vegetative stems. All develop erect and branched repro-
ductive stalks. Eryngium cuneifolium and H. cumulicola are bisexual
and self compatible, and P. basiramia is gynodioecious (Menges and
Yahr, 1998). Hypericum cumulicola and P. basiramia are obligate seed-
ers, while E. cuneifolium can rarely resprout after ﬁre (Menges and
Kohfeldt, 1995). Seeds of E. cuneifolium (⬃1–2 mm wide) are at least
2– 4 times larger than H. cumulicola seeds or P. basiramia achenes.
Eryngium cuneifolium and H. cumulicola appear to disperse by gravity
and have limited dispersal distances (⬍2 m; Menges et al., 1998). In
contrast, the persistent calyxes of the achenes of P. basiramia appear
to be adapted for wind dispersal.

Study sites—We established ﬁeld experiments at The Nature Con-
servancy’s Lake Apthorpe Preserve (Apthorpe) and at Archbold Bio-
logical Station (Archbold). Both sites are located in the southern part
of the Lake Wales Ridge, Florida, and are characterized by a mosaic of
Florida scrub, ﬂatwoods, and seasonal ponds (Abrahamson et al., 1984;
Menges, 1998; Menges and Hawkes, 1998). Our study sites included
three recently burned and three long-unburned rosemary scrub patches.
This is a particularly open and xeric type of Florida scrub restricted to
well-drained white sands (Abrahamson et al., 1984; Menges and Haw-
kes, 1998; Menges, 1998). Prescribed ﬁres were applied in April 1994

at Apthorpe, and in September 1993 and May 1995 at Archbold (Kevin
Main and Steve Shatler, personal communication). The three long un-
burned scrub patches have been without ﬁre for at least 20 yr, but
include some large openings of bare sand.

Seed germination, ﬁre, and lichens (experiment 1)—We sowed
seeds of the focal species with and without ground lichens in recently
and long-unburned patches. We collected up to four mature fruits of E.
cuneifolium, H. cumulicola, and P. basiramia from individual plants.
Fruits were opened in the laboratory and examined under the micro-
scope to select seeds without signs of damage or deformation. The seeds
were temporarily stored in aluminum foil within labeled paper bags.
We placed 20 triplets of wire mesh cages (one cage per species; 20
⫻ 20 ⫻ 4 cm with 0.6 cm mesh) every 5 m along random transects in
recently burned rosemary scrub and in available gaps at least 1 m from
the closest Florida rosemary in long-unburned rosemary scrub. Within
each triplet, seeds of each species were placed in their own cage (E.
cuneifolium, 20 fruits, November 1995; H. cumulicola, 80 seeds, July
and September 1995, sown twice to mimic its longer fruiting season;
P. basiramia, 40 fruits, December 1995). In half of the cages, we added
a 3 cm width thallus fragment from each of the two most common
ground lichen genera at the study sites, Cladonia spp. (mostly C. le-
porina) and Cladina spp. (mostly C. evansii). Seeds were deposited on
the ground inside partially buried dark green plastic pots (13 ⫻ 11 ⫻
5 cm pots without bottoms for drainage) within the cages, and watered
once. We also placed two control groups of each species outdoors on
ﬁlter paper within a petri dish and followed their germination for 4 mo.
Seeds, seedlings, and other biological material for all our experiments
were not transferred among sites. Response variables were percentage
germination and subsequent seedling survival.
Log-linear models were employed to compare differences in the pro-
portion of cages with germinated seeds (P) among sites (S), ﬁre (B),
and lichen treatments (L). The signiﬁcance of an interaction was mea-
sured relative to the model to which it was added. We used BLS,P as
‘‘null model,’’ assuming that this table reﬂects treatment distribution of
the cages and the frequency of cages with seedlings, but this frequency
is independent of site, ﬁre, and lichens (Fienberg, 1987). We used
Mann-Whitney U tests to examine seedling number variation among
the same treatments.

Effects of shrubs on transplanted plants (experiment 2)—We trans-
planted E. cuneifolium, H. cumulicola, and P. basiramia to microsites
in the center of open sandy areas and in the proximity of dominant
shrub species. We used Florida rosemary scrub patches with different
ﬁre histories and protected some plants from large herbivores.

Culture, transplantation, and plant measurements—We germinated E.
cuneifolium, H. cumulicola, and P. basiramia seeds on humid ﬁlter

paper in petri dishes and transplanted 2–5 d old seedlings to plastic
bags (⬃250 mL [8 oz] disposable baby feeding bottles) with local soil
(see Table 1). The seedlings were watered as needed, kept under 40 W
ﬂuorescent lamps (F40 agrolite, 1600 lumens) in a unheated greenhouse,
and later transplanted to the ﬁeld. We also excavated 100 P. basiramia
juveniles (before they developed reproductive stems) from each site
between 26 September and 2 October 1995. We used a 20 ⫻ 6 cm PVC
(polyvinyl chloride) tube and a mallet to unearth the plants. The sand
cylinder with the plant was transferred to a plastic bag (⬃250 mL dis-
posable baby feeding bottles), watered, and kept in a greenhouse until
transplanting. All plants were transplanted to the ﬁeld in April 1996
except P. basiramia juveniles in February 1996. We made holes with
a soil auger (8 cm wide) to receive the transplants and removed litter,
ground lichens, and plants within a 10 cm radius. Plants were watered
once after transplant (⬃0.5 L).
We measured height and branch length (or cover) at the time of
transplanting and height, branch length (or cover), reproductive status,
survival, and damage by large herbivores monthly until November
1996. Fecundity (number of ﬂowers and fruits for H. cumulicola and
number of clusters for P. basiramia) was evaluated in July, October,
and November 1996. Plants were removed from the soil in November
1996, dried (Fisher Isotemp Oven Senior Model/Forced draft, Gottin-
gen, Germany) for 48 h, and weighed (Sartorious scale model 1264;
0.01 g). There were no signiﬁcant differences in height and branch
length (or cover) at transplant time among individuals of the same spe-
cies in contrasting microhabitats within sites, except for the height of
H. cumulicola transplanted in Apthorpe (F ⫽ 2.62, P ⫽ 0.043, df 4,

Experiment 2a: plants without cages—We transplanted E. cuneifol-

juveniles (N ⫽ 16, 18, 15, 13, 8, 8, 11, 15, 15, 16) unprotected from
large herbivores to ﬁve experimental microsites resulting from combi-
nations of two different levels of time-since-ﬁre (recently burned and
long-unburned patches) and three microhabitats deﬁned by shrub dis-
tance and shrub species (Florida rosemary height ⫽ 119.9 ⫾ 46.4 cm
[mean and standard deviation]; Quercus spp. height ⫽ 78.8 ⫾ 29.6 cm,
and 97.3 ⫾ 39.6 cm in time since ﬁre, respectively). Microhabitats
adjacent to shrubs were shaded part of the day. We used three microsites
near the southern end of natural gaps: (1) open habitat—1 m away from
any oak canopy and 2 m from any Florida rosemary canopy; (2) near
oak—below the drip line of the northern margin of an oak canopy
bordering an open area; and (3) near Florida rosemary—below the drip
line of the northern margin of the canopy of a Florida rosemary bor-
dering an open area. These three treatments were not applied to E.
cuneifolium and H. cumulicola in the long-unburned area at Archbold.
We used only two microsites in recently burned patches: (1) open sites;
(2) near oak. Recently burned patches contained only seedlings of Flor-
ida rosemary. We distributed transplants randomly among treatments
within sites. One individual of each species was included in a replicated
triplet (except as indicated), 20 cm apart from each other focal plant in
each microhabitat studied. Final sample size was reduced by exclusion
of plants disturbed by animals (probably raccoons).

Experiment 2b: seedlings inside cages—We transplanted seedlings of
E. cuneifolium (N ⫽ 13, 14, habitat order as in Fig. 4), H. cumulicola
(N ⫽ 14, 13), and P. basiramia (N ⫽ 10, 13) into microsites protected
from large herbivores. We chose two microhabitats in Florida rosemary
scrub patches at Archbold: (1) open habitat in a recently burned patch,

approximately every 5 m along two random transects, at least 2 m from
the nearest oak; and (2) near Florida rosemary in a long-unburned patch,
below the drip line of the northern margin of the shrub canopy border-
ing an open area. We distributed transplants randomly (one individual
of each species per group) and 20 cm from every other focal plant.
Each group of plants was enclosed in a wire mesh cage (46 ⫻ 46 ⫻ 40
cm and 0.6 cm mesh).
Contingency tables and G tests were used to compare differences in
survival of transplants between shrub treatments. We described growth
variation within species only in terms of biomass because of the high
correlation between size variables (r 2 ⫽ 0.63–0.82, P ⬍ 0.001 in every
case). The signiﬁcance of differences in ﬁnal aboveground biomass (nat-
ural-log transformed) among transplants in different microhabitats was
evaluated with analysis of variance for H. cumulicola and P. basiramia.
An exact randomization test was employed for E. cuneifolium biomass
data because of its small sample sizes (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981). The
effect of ﬁre and microhabitat on total number of reproductive structures
(using height as a covariate) was assessed using analysis of covariance.

Effect of experimental removal of neighbors (experiment 3)—We
evaluated the effect of neighboring herbaceous and small shrub species
around 20 naturally occurring focal individuals of each of our study
species per site. Plants were selected in a stratiﬁed random fashion,
along the center of randomly located 2 m wide belt transects. We com-
pared naturally occurring H. cumulicola individuals in a recently burned
rosemary scrub patch with those in a long-unburned scrub patch, at
Archbold and Apthorpe. We studied P. basiramia from the same long-
unburned scrub patches, but this species was not present in recently
burned patches. Eryngium cuneifolium was examined in the same re-
cently burned scrub at Apthorpe and at the border of a rosemary scrub
at Archbold. We removed all plants and ground lichens within 30 cm
of half of all focal plants in June 1995 and January and June 1996. We
counted number of stems and total number of reproductive structures
(ﬂowering stalks of P. basiramia) and measured height and total branch
length of each focal H. cumulicola and P. basiramia, and maximum
width and its perpendicular width for each E. cuneifolium.
We counted and identiﬁed all rooted plant species, recorded the pres-

ence of ground lichens within 15 cm of studied individuals, measured
the distance of every individual to the nearest oak and Florida rosemary,
and measured the height of these shrubs. We used Detrended Corre-
spondence Analysis in PC-ORD (McCune, 1993) to depict multivariate
changes in dominance of species neighborhoods for each focal species
in recently burned and long-unburned sites.

RESULTS

Seed germination, ﬁre, and lichens (experiment 1)—
Germination and soil seed dynamics were different
among the three study species. Seed germination was
highest for P. basiramia. Most (⬎95%) seeds of P. bas-
iramia in the control petri dishes germinated during the
ﬁrst 4 d following their placement outdoors. However,
after ⬃120 d, only 20 – 40% H. cumulicola seeds and 5–
20% E. cuneifolium seeds in the petri dishes germinated.
In the ﬁeld, seeds started germinating by December 1995.
Polygonella basiramia seedlings were present in most of
the cages within 1 mo of sowing, and between 12 and
45% of them remained alive after 14 mo (Table 2). By
January 1996, H. cumulicola seedlings occurred in ⬍30%
of cages and no more new seedlings of these species were
found after March 1996. Hypericum cumulicola seedling
survival was generally low. We did not ﬁnd any seedlings
of E. cuneifolium during the ﬁrst 9 mo, but a few seed-
lings germinated between December 1996 and January
1997, a year after sowing (Table 2).
Site and lichen presence affected P. basiramia. The
proportion of cages with P. basiramia seeds germinated
(Table 2) and ﬁnal seedling number per cage (z ⫽ ⫺2.11;
P ⫽ 0.03) were higher in Apthorpe than Archbold. Nei-
ther ﬁre history nor presence of ground lichens affected
the proportion of cages with P. basiramia seeds germi-
nated. Final seedling number was higher in cages without
lichens than with lichens in both sites but only statisti-

We could not analyze the responses of E. cuneifolium and
H. cumulicola seeds and seedlings to the presence of
ground lichens, ﬁre history, or site because of their low
germination rates (Table 2).

Effects of shrubs on transplanted plants (experiments
2a and 2b)—The effects of ﬁre and shrub presence on
survival differed among the three study species. Survival
of E. cuneifolium and H. cumulicola transplanted without
cages was signiﬁcantly higher in recently burned patches
than in long-unburned patches at Apthorpe (Fig. 1; G ⫽
3.94, 1 df, P ⫽ 0.047 for E. cuneifolium; G ⫽ 9.73, 1
df, P ⫽ 0.002 for H. cumulicola). We found no signiﬁcant
survival differences for E. cuneifolium and H. cumulicola
transplanted to different microhabitats (oak, rosemary, or
open), nor any signiﬁcant effects of ﬁre or microhabitat
on P. basiramia survival in either site (Fig. 1; P ⬎ 0.15
for any test). Survival rates were fairly high for trans-
plants in most treatments (Fig. 1).
Fire or shrub presence differentially affected ﬁnal bio-
mass of all three study species. Final biomass of surviv-
ing E. cuneifolium transplants in Apthorpe was higher
near oaks in recently burned patches than in any other
microhabitat (Fig. 2; P ⫽ 0.028, randomization test). Fi-
nal biomass of surviving H. cumulicola transplants was
higher in the burned area at Apthorpe, but no signiﬁcant
differences were found due to shrub microhabitat (Fig. 2;
Table 3). Polygonella basiramia transplants in Apthorpe
and near oaks and in open habitats had higher ﬁnal bio-
mass (Fig. 2; Table 3).
Fecundity also varied by treatment. The number of re-
productive structures was larger in open burned habitats
for H. cumulicola in Apthorpe (Fig. 3; Table 3). Poly-
gonella basiramia transplanted to the recently burned
patch in Apthorpe had higher fecundity than those trans-
planted to the long-unburned patch (Fig. 3; signiﬁcant
interaction S ⫻ F in Table 3) but we did not ﬁnd any

signiﬁcant differences in Archbold (Fig. 3). The Poly-
gonella basiramia gender ratio was not signiﬁcantly het-
erogeneous inside treatments (39 females and 32 her-
maphrodites; G ⫽ 1.47, 4 df, P ⫽ 0.831). Transplanted
E. cuneifolium did not ﬂower during the study interval.
We found evidence of herbivory on E. cuneifolium, H.
cumulicola, and P. basiramia throughout the study peri-
od. Many damaged plants were clipped to the base.
After 7 mo, the three species protected inside cages
had lower performance when transplanted near Florida
rosemary in the long-unburned patch than in the open
habitat of the recently burned patch, but they varied in
the strength of their response. Survival of E. cuneifolium
was signiﬁcantly lower than that of P. basiramia and H.
cumulicola in both patch types (Fig. 4; G ⫽ 7.60, 2 df,
P ⫽ 0.022 and G ⫽ 7.52, 2 df, P ⫽ 0.023 in recently
and long-unburned patches, respectively). Survival with-
in species was not signiﬁcantly different among patches.
Final biomass was lower near rosemary in the long-un-
burned patch than in the open area of the recently burned
patch for each of the three species (Fig. 4; Table 4). By
the end of the trial P. basiramia reached higher biomass
than H. cumulicola, which was heavier than E. cuneifol-
ium (Fig. 4; Table 4). Hypericum cumulicola and P. bas-
iramia transplanted near rosemary in the long-unburned
patch ﬂowered later and had lower reproductive output
and reproductive effort than those in the recently burned
patch (Figs. 3, 5; Table 4). Eryngium cuneifolium did not
ﬂower during the experiment.

(experiment 3)—After 12 mo, ⬍20% of target H. cu-
mulicola and E. cuneifolium died, but 50 –80% (by site
and microhabitat combination) of P. basiramia perished.
Reproductive effort (number of ﬂowers and fruits/height)

of focal H. cumulicola in June 1996 (the beginning of
reproductive season) was not signiﬁcantly different be-
tween site, time since ﬁre, or removal treatments (any P

tures on any focal E. cuneifolium or P. basiramia.

Analysis of microhabitat characteristics—We found E.
cuneifolium, H. cumulicola, and P. basiramia in contrast-
ing locations on gradients of distance to shrubs, presence
of lichens, and neighbor ﬂoristic composition and abun-
dance. In long-unburned patches, P. basiramia occurred
closer to oaks and rosemary than H. cumulicola (Fig. 6).
In recently burned patches (which lacked P. basiramia),
H. cumulicola occurred closer to oaks than E. cuneifolium
(Fig. 6).
Ground lichens were present in 60 –75% of the neigh-
borhoods of P. basiramia and H. cumulicola in long un-
burned patches, but in ⬍20% of E. cuneifolium. Fewer
than 30% of the neighborhoods of H. cumulicola and E.
cuneifolium had ground lichens in the patches 2–3 yr
postﬁre.
We found ⬎30 species in the study species’ neighbor-
hoods, including grasses, forbs, and shrubs. Conspeciﬁcs
were frequent in the neighborhoods of the focal species.

herbaceous species common in open areas, were the most
frequent neighbor species. Neighborhood species richness
and abundance were highest for E. cuneifolium and low-
est for P. basiramia.
There were signiﬁcant effects of study site and focal
species on scores of the ﬁrst axes of the neighbor ﬂoristic
gradients detected by DECORANA ordination (eigenval-
ue 0.817, N ⫽ 294; Table 5). The neighborhoods of E.
cuneifolium were subsets of the neighborhoods for the
other two species and grouped in the lower left portion
of the cloud of points in the space deﬁned by the ﬁrst
two axes of the ordination (Fig. 7). This portion of the
graph was mostly characterized by herbaceous species
and a few common shrubs (Opuntia humifusa and Pa-
lafoxia feayii). The neighbors of P. basiramia and H.
cumulicola overlapped considerably and had a wider dis-
tribution in the ordination space.

DISCUSSION

Understanding the relative importance of direct and in-
direct ﬁre effects on postﬁre responses of herbaceous spe-
cies is central for wise management (e.g., Tyler, 1996,
and references therein). Demographic variation in re-
sponse to changes in shrub and lichen cover importance
may help to explain the contrasting distribution of Eryn-
gium cuneifolium, Hypericum cumulicola and Polygonel-
la basiramia along a time-since-ﬁre gradient. Observed
species patterns were concordant with their differential

QUINTANA-ASCENCIO AND MENGES—THREE ENDEMIC SPECIES ALONG A FIRE GRADIENT

sensitivity to ﬁre, presence or absence of gaps and patch
size. Polygonella basiramia survival and biomass were
least affected by time since ﬁre, but its seedlings showed
increasing mortality near ground lichens. Previous work
found P. basiramia natural densities were unrelated to
time since ﬁre but sensitive to the amount of open sand
(Hawkes and Menges, 1995). The lower survival and bio-
mass of transplanted H. cumulicola and E. cuneifolium
in long-unburned paches were similar to that found in
naturally occurring populations (Menges and Kimmich,
1996; Quintana-Ascencio and Morales Herna´ ndez, 1997).
A 10-yr study of E. cuneifolium populations documented
their extinction in Florida rosemary scrub patches be-
tween 20 and 30 yr postﬁre (Menges and Yahr, 1998).
Mortality in H. cumulicola is lowest shortly after ﬁre,
although subsequent patterns are more complex (Quin-
tana-Ascencio, 1997). Overall mortality rates were higher
for P. basiramia than for the other species, consistent
with demographic differences seen in long-term studies
(Menges and Kimmich, 1996; Quintana-Ascencio and
Morales-Herna´ ndez, 1997; Menges, unpublished data).
The analysis of microhabitats that is part of this study
provides additional detail on the microsites within gaps
where these three species can grow. Eryngium cuneifol-
ium appears more sensitive to gaps (Menges and Kim-
mich, 1996), its microhabitats were farther from large
shrubs, less covered by lichens, and ﬂoristically charac-
terized by more herbaceous and fewer shrub species than
the other two species. Polygonella basiramia requires
only small gaps and can even persist in the small, rather
ephemeral gaps of scrubby ﬂatwoods (Young and Men-
ges, 1999).
Because there are predictable changes in rosemary
community structure as the sites age between ﬁres (Haw-
kes and Menges, 1996), the explanations based on ﬁre
and gaps are complementary. As rosemary sites age, the
cover of lichens and the abundance of large shrubs in-
crease (Menges and Kohlfeldt, 1995). Growth of shrubs,
especially Florida rosemary, decreases gap sizes and area
(Hawkes and Menges, 1996). As gaps shrink, microhab-
itats become less favorable ﬁrst for E. cuneifolium, later
for H. cumulicola, and ﬁnally for P. basiramia.
What makes postﬁre environments and open gaps so
critical for E. cuneifolium and H. cumulicola? There are
at least seven possible and nonmutually exclusive hy-
potheses (modiﬁed from Sousa, 1984). These involve
competition from large shrubs, competition from small
shrubs and herbs, competition from ground lichens, com-
petition from the cryptobiotic soil crust, direct effects of
ﬁre, differential herbivory, and seed dormancy and ger-
mination.
This study addresses many of these hypotheses, al-
though not all the answers are clear. Herbaceous species
in unburned sites often survive at higher rates after shrub
removal or trenching to reduce their root competition
(e.g., Swank and Oechel, 1991; Tyler, 1996). In our
study, large shrubs that border the gap appear to have
differential effects depending on the shrub species.
Neighboring oaks in recently burned patches facilitate the
growth of transplants. However, neighboring rosemary
shrubs often were associated with the slowest growth
rates of our study species. Since Florida rosemary is
killed by ﬁre and has only small seedlings in recently

burned sites, its effects are difﬁcult to completely sepa-
rate from the effects of ﬁre per se. In natural populations,
rosemary shrub presence, size, and distance proved to be
among the most important factors predicting demograph-
ic performance of E. cuneifolium (Menges and Kimmich,
1996) and H. cumulicola (Quintana-Ascencio and Mo-
rales-Herna´ ndez, 1997). The mechanisms could involve
allelochemicals that affect germination of other species
(Williamson, Obee, and Weidenhamer, 1992).
On the other hand, there were no signiﬁcant effects of
small shrubs and herbs within the gaps on the perfor-
mance of transplants in this study. This is consistent with
their lack of effects on naturally occurring E. cuneifolium
(Menges and Kimmich, 1996), H. cumulicola (Quintana-
Ascencio and Morales-Herna´ ndez, 1997), and P. basi-
ramia (Hawkes and Menges, 1995).
This study provides some weak evidence that ground
lichens can affect the early stages in the life cycle of
herbaceous species. Lichens increased seedling mortality
in P. basiramia and resulted in lower seedling densities
in H. cumulicola in these experiments. In community
plots in rosemary scrub, seedling recruitment was in-
creased by lichen removal (Menges and Hawkes, unpub-
lished data). Biotic soil crusts could also affect germi-
nation and nutrient cycling and may interact with lichens
as well (Lawrey, 1986; Bever, Westover and Antonovics,
1997; Hawkes, unpublished data).
Fire may have direct effects that are not reﬂected in
changes in community structure, including heating of the
soil, release or combustion of nutrients, smoke produc-
tion, and volatilization of allelochemics (McPherson and
Muller, 1969; Christensen and Muller, 1975b; Keeley and
Keeley, 1987; Tyler, 1996; Keeley and Fotheringham,
1998). Nutrient addition experiments at Archbold suggest
that community responses in scrubby ﬂatwoods are not
strongly tied to any postﬁre nutrient ﬂush (Dawn Berry,
unpublished data), but phosphorus fertilization mimicked
ﬁre effects on ﬂowering for one of two populations of an
herb growing on xeric sandhill soils in Florida (Brewer,
1995). Nutrient addition alone did not affect survival of
herbs in an unburned chaparral (Swank and Oechel,
1991). Heating experiments on seeds of some scrub spe-
cies have not demonstrated any signiﬁcant effects on ger-
mination percentages (Menges, unpublished data). The
fact that the transplant experiments in this study occurred
after ﬁres, yet had qualitatively similar patterns to natural
populations affected by ﬁre, suggests that direct effects
of ﬁre do not account for most of the postﬁre patterns
seen.
Herbivores can affect postﬁre plant survival (Christen-
sen and Muller, 1975a; Swank and Oechel, 1991; Tyler,
1996). In this study, herbivory was quite variable in space
and time and does not seem consistent with being the
major force differentiating early postﬁre and unburned
environments, nor explaining the different positions of
the three study species on a postﬁre gradient. However,
herbivory in Florida scrub remains little studied.
Seed dormancy and germination are clearly important
components of these species’ life histories, and our stud-
ies have garnered some important information in this re-
gard. Polygonella basiramia is the only one of these three
species not to possess a persistent seed bank, according
to our experiments. These results are consistent with its

lack of germination from rosemary scrub soil samples
(Kohfeldt and Menges, unpublished data). In contrast, E.
cuneifolium and H. cumulicola delay some seed germi-
nation and are capable of forming a persistent seed bank,
with germination occurring after ﬁre. Again, this is con-
sistent with a community seed bank survey (Kohfeldt and
Menges, unpublished data) and results of experimental
burial of H. cumulicola seeds (Quintana-Ascencio, Dolan
and Menges, 1998).
Patterns of natural seedling appearance in relation to
ﬁre are also consistent with our experiments. Seedlings
of H. cumulicola and E. cuneifolium appear within a year
of ﬁre, sometimes in large numbers. Polygonella basi-
ramia seedlings appear more gradually within a few years
of ﬁre. This species must be recruiting from seeds dis-
persed from unburned patches, which are common in
rosemary scrub (Main and Menges, 1997). Of the three
species, P. basiramia appears best dispersed. Perhaps as
a consequence of this better dispersal as well as the abil-
ity to use small patches in the surrounding scrubby ﬂat-
woods matrix, P. basiramia is the only species of the
three not to exhibit patterns of site occupancy consistent
with metapopulation dynamics (Quintana-Ascencio and
Menges, 1996).
These results have several implications for manage-
ment. First, prescribed ﬁre is a useful tool in controlling
the competitive effects of large shrubs and lichens on
these herbaceous plants and in providing opportunities
for seedling recruitment. Since each species differs from
the others in its range of postﬁre tolerance, microsite
preferences, and tolerance to competition, variable ﬁre
frequencies and spatially patchy ﬁre intensities are most
likely to retain all three species in the landscape. Variable
ﬁre frequencies will also beneﬁt other endangered species
with different requirements. Patchy ﬁres will beneﬁt P.
basiramia in particular, since it requires dispersal from
unburned patches. However, patchy ﬁres may also be an
advantage to the other two species by allowing recolo-
nization of gaps from small, unburned patches. Variable
and patchy ﬁres are the environmental milieu within
which these scrub species evolved and are likely the best
conditions for maintainance of biodiversity and popula-
tion viability.
