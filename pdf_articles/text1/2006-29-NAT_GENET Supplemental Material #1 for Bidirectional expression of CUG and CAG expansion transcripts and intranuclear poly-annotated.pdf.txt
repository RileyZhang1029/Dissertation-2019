Supplementary Figure 1:  Immunohistochemistry of TATA binding protein.  

Because SCA17 is caused by polyglutamine encoding CAG repeat expansion within the 
TBP, autopsy tissue from a genetically confirmed SCA17 patient was used as a positive 
control.  In the SCA17 tissue, TBP staining is found in the nuclei of pontine neurons (a) 
(representative pan-nuclear reaction enlarged in box) and cerebellar granule cells (d).  No 
staining is found in tissues from an SCA8 BAC-Exp mouse (b, e) or an SCA8 patient (c, f) 
in which 1C2-positive intranuclear inclusions/ pan-nuclear reaction were confirmed.  Scale 
bars each = 30Î¼m
