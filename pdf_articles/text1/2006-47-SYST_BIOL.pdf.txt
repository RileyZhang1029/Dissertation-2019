Steel 
(2005) and Pardi and Goldman 
(2005) 
Recently, 
have 
shown 
that being greedy works 
if one 
is interested 
in selecting k taxa from a phylogenetic 
tree that maximize 
the phylogenetic 
diversity. The 
term phylogenetic diversity 
(PD) was 
coined by Faith 
(1992) 
to provide 
an effective 
measure 
of 
the diversity 
of a group 
of 
taxa. The opti 
mal PD describes 
the amount of diversity 
embraced by a 
chosen 
subset of taxa. Faith 
(1992) applied PD 
properly 
to place conservation 
on different 
priorities

the taxa to protect 
reflect a certain value of taxonomic di 
some measurable 
versity. Thus, 
indicator of biodiversity 
defined 
on different 
scales 
(taxa, group of taxa, ecosys 
tems, etc.) 
is assigned 
to the corresponding 
systematic 
categories. With 
the advent 
of molecular 
genetics, 
evo 
lutionary divergence 
on the genomic 
level may also serve 
this purpose 
(Pardi and Goldman, 
2005). 
For 
the following, 
the precise nature of the measure 
of phylogenetic 
is not relevant 
(cf. Humphries 
diversity 
et al., 1995; Williams 
and Araujo, 
2002, 
for a discussion 
on diversity measures). 
should 
Phylogenetic 
diversity 
simply describe 
the overall value of a group of taxa either 
in terms of genetic diversity, 
or social 
regional diversity, 
it is required 
that 
these measures 
diversity. Moreover, 
can be mapped 
onto a phylogenetic 
tree 
in a way 
that 
the branches 
of the tree receive non-negative 
weights. 
The problem 
is then as follows: From a tree with n taxa, 
one wants 
to identify k taxa that retain 
the maximal 
phy 
logenetic diversity, 
therefore 
taking 
into account 
the fact 
that due 
to restricted 
resources 
only a certain percent 
age of the taxa can be sustained. 
Steel 
(2005) and Pardi 
and Goldman 
(2005) have proven 
that a greedy approach 
yields 
the optimal 
set with 
respect 
to PD. The greedy 
strategy 
repeatedly 
selects 
the taxon 
that adds 
the most 
divergence 
to the already 
chosen 
set of taxa. The pro 
cedure 
is repeated 
until k taxa are found. Both proofs 
or 
theory of weighted 
apply?directly

matroids 
and greedy algorithms 
(Korte et al., 1991). From 
this theory 
it follows 
that an algorithm with

Notation 
Following 
Steel 
(2005), we 
call T an unrooted 
phylo 
genetic X-tree; 
that 
is, a tree with 
leaf set X of taxa and 
whose 
interior nodes 
are of degree 
at 
least 
remaining 
three. V denotes 
the set of all nodes of T and ? the col 
lection of edges or branches. 
? denotes 
the edge-weight 
function 
that assigns 
to each edge e = 
(v, w e V) 
(v, w), 
of T a (non-negative) 
branch 
length X(v, w) > 0. 
A path V(a,b) 
denotes 
the collection 
of distinct nodes 

a = 

vq,v\, 

..., 

vm+\

in a tree

v?, u?+i are ad

by an edge. The sum of the edge

of all edges along 
the path between 
two nodes 
weights 
a and b denotes 
their distance 
d(a, b) in the tree. 
To describe 
the algorithms, 
it will be handy 
to root 
T at a node 
r. Then 
the remaining 
leaves are descen 
dents 
from r. Thus, 
for each node 
v eV 
the set Lmax(v) 
is well defined 
and denotes 
the descendant(s) 
farthest 
from v. For 
away 
the sake of clarity, we abbreviate 
the 
d[v, Lmax(v)] as dmax(v).

For a subset W of X we 
consider T\ W, 
the 
induced 
phylogenetic W-tree, 
that connects

ing to T. Finally, ?w assigns 
to each edge 
e of T\ W 
the 
sum of the X(e) values 
over 
those edges 
in T along 
the 
path 
that corresponds 
to the new edge e. The phylogenetic 
diversity of W, denoted PD(W), 
is then

At each pruning
