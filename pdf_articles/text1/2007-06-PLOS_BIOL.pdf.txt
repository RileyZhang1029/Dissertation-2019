Pressure overload–induced hypertrophy is a key step leading to heart failure. The Ca2þ-induced Ca2þ release (CICR)
process that governs cardiac contractility is defective in hypertrophy/heart failure, but the molecular mechanisms
remain elusive. To examine the intermolecular aspects of CICR during hypertrophy, we utilized loose-patch confocal
imaging to visualize the signaling between a single L-type Ca2þ channel (LCC) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in aortic
stenosis rat models of compensated (CHT) and decompensated (DHT) hypertrophy. We found that the LCC-RyR
intermolecular coupling showed a 49% prolongation in coupling latency, a 47% decrease in chance of hit, and a 72%
increase in chance of miss in DHT, demonstrating a state of ‘‘intermolecular failure.’’ Unexpectedly, these modifications
also occurred robustly in CHT due at least partially to decreased expression of junctophilin,
indicating that
intermolecular failure occurs prior to cellular manifestations. As a result, cell-wide Ca2þ release, visualized as ‘‘Ca2þ
spikes,’’ became desynchronized, which contrasted sharply with unaltered spike integrals and whole-cell Ca2þ
transients in CHT. These data suggested that, within a certain limit, termed the ‘‘stability margin,’’ mild intermolecular
failure does not damage the cellular integrity of excitation-contraction coupling. Only when the modification steps
beyond the stability margin does global failure occur. The discovery of ‘‘hidden’’ intermolecular failure in CHT has
important clinical implications.

Introduction

In response to pressure overload, the heart produces an
adaptive response in the form of cardiac hypertrophy to
maintain adequate cardiac output and tissue perfusion [1–3].
In the early stage of hypertrophy, cardiac contractile
dysfunction is not present, and the ventricle is hemodynami-
cally compensated. When the pressure stimuli are persistent,
the heart usually undergoes functional deterioration, even-
tually leading to heart failure [3,4]. In the failure stage, the
heart becomes incapable of generating sufﬁcient pumping
power. To prevent the pathogenesis of heart failure, one
strategy has been to stop or postpone the transition of
hypertrophy from the compensated stage toward the decom-
pensated stage [4]. Therefore, understanding the cellular and
molecular mechanisms involved in cardiac hypertrophy is
important for developing clinical therapies against heart
failure.
At
the ce l lu lar leve l ,
the contracti le power during
excitation-contraction coupling (E-C coupling) is governed
by a mechanism known as Ca2þ-induced Ca2þ release (CICR)
[5,6]. In this process, Ca2þ inﬂux through L-type Ca2þ
channels (LCCs) on the cell surface membrane (including T-
tubules) activates ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2þ release from
the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to generate cell-wide Ca2þ
transients [7–9]. Besides LCCs and RyRs, Ca2þ cycling
proteins, e.g., SR Ca2þ pumps (SERCA), Naþ-Ca2þ exchangers,
and their regulatory mechanisms, are also important in
determining the amplitude and kinetics of Ca2þ transients [8].

All these mechanisms have been studied in a wide variety of
hypertrophy and heart failure models [8,10–14]. Most studies
support the idea that the LCC activity does not change much
during hypertrophy and heart failure [11]. However, the Ca2þ
transients triggered by comparable LCC currents are de-
creased in amplitude and/or slowed in kinetics in most
models of decompensated hypertrophy (DHT) and heart
failure [11,13]. These studies lead to the notion that the Ca2þ
inﬂux through LCCs becomes less effective in triggering RyR
Ca2þ release [13]. Yet the molecular details underlying
defective E-C coupling remain unknown. On the other hand,
studies on compensated hypertrophy (CHT), a stage prior to
DHT, show that the cellular aspects of E-C coupling still
appear to be normal or even slightly enhanced [15]. It is thus

Author Summary

High blood pressure induces hypertrophy, a thickening of the
cardiac muscle that eventually leads to heart failure, a leading cause
of morbidity and mortality. The contractile power of the heart
depends in part on signaling between calcium channels on the cell
membrane (L-type Ca2þ channels) and calcium release channels on a
specialized calcium-regulating organelle called the sarcoplasmic
reticulum. This signaling process is defective in heart failure. We
have found that the signaling efficiency between a single L-type
channel and its controlled Ca2þ release channels decreases during
the transition from hypertrophy to heart failure. Moreover, we find
unexpectedly that the signaling failure between channels occurs
even before any obvious defect in the cardiac cell’s ability to
contract is seen. In normal cells, the timing between calcium influx
and release is rapid; but
in hypertrophy before heart
failure
manifests, there is a delay in this signaling process. In seeking the
underlying mechanisms of this intermolecular failure, we find that a
protein known as junctophilin, which anchors the sarcoplasmic
reticulum to the cell membrane system, is expressed at a lower level.
These results reveal early molecular events associated with the
progression of hypertrophy, and may provide new insights for
developing methods of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent
heart failure.

intriguing to know whether and when the intermolecular
process of CICR is modiﬁed and how the modiﬁcation
eventually leads to cellular failure in E-C coupling.
During past years, we have developed a local Ca2þ imaging
protocol
in conjunction with a loose-seal patch clamp
technique to investigate LCC-RyR intermolecular coupling
[9,16]. In the present study, we utilized this technique and an
aortic stenosis model
to test
the hypothesis that
the
intermolecular coupling between an LCC and RyRs under-
goes a progressive modiﬁcation during the development of
hypertrophy. Our results showed that hypertrophy resulted in
an increase in LCC-RyR coupling latency and a decrease in
intermolecular signaling efﬁciency, which started at the early,
compensated stage when cellular E-C coupling appeared
normal. Our ﬁndings provided intermolecular insights into
the remodeling of Ca2þ signaling during the pathogenesis
leading to heart failure.

Results

To elucidate the microscopic modiﬁcation of E-C coupling
during hypertrophy, we created pressure-overload hyper-
trophy models induced by aortic stenosis [17]. About 7–11 wk
after aorta banding, hemodynamic and echocardiographic
measurements identiﬁed the status of CHT by increased left
ventricle (LV) wall thickness and normal contractile indices,
and the status of DHT by the onset of mild depression of
contractile indices in addition to thickened LV walls (Figure
1A, 1B, and 1C; Table S1). To characterize the cellular aspects
of E-C coupling, we combined a whole-cell patch clamp
technique and confocal line-scan imaging to record simulta-
neously LCC Ca2þ current (ICa) and intracellular Ca2þ
transients when the cell membrane was depolarized to 0
mV (Figure 1D). Cell capacitance (Figure S1A) and contrac-
tion (Figure S1B) were also measured. In DHT, despite the
unchanged ICa density and kinetics (Figure 1E and Figure S1C
and S1D), both the amplitude of Ca2þ transients and cell

contraction decreased signiﬁcantly (Figure 1F and Figure
S1B). As a result, the gain of E-C coupling was signiﬁcantly
lower than that of the control (Figure 1G). By contrast,
neither the amplitude of Ca2þ transients nor the gain of E-C
coupling was altered in CHT, indicating that the hyper-
trophy-associated E-C coupling deﬁciency occurs only in the
late, decompensated stage, but not in the early, compensated
stage.

LCC-RyR Coupling during Hypertrophy
To determ ine whether and how the intermolecular
coupling between LCCs and RyRs is modiﬁed in different
stages of hypertrophy, we utilized loose-patch confocal
imaging [9] to visualize simultaneously the Ca2þ sparklet
from an LCC and the triggered Ca2þ sparks from RyRs. The
visibility of LCC sparklets was enhanced by adding to the
pipette solution 20 mM Ca2þ and 10 lM FPL64176, an LCC
agonist that decreases the channel opening frequency, but
prompts long openings [9,18,19]. Upon depolarization of the
on-cell membrane patch, confocal line-scan imaging detected
two distinct populations of local Ca2þ signals (Figure 2A): the
steep, high-amplitude events, sensitive to ryanodine, were
Ca2þ sparks from RyRs; the ﬂat,
low-amplitude events,
resistant to ryanodine, but sensitive to nifedipine, were
Ca2þ sparklets from individual LCCs [9]. Examination of Ca2þ
sparks identiﬁed no signiﬁcant differences in spark ampli-
tude (Figure 2B) and time to peak (Figure 2C), indicating that
the spark generation process per se was basically unaltered
during hypertrophy.
We then examined the probability of LCC-RyR coupling.
The three recordings in Figure 2A, selected from the control,
CHT, and DHT groups, show that individual LCC Ca2þ
sparklets activated Ca2þ sparks in a hit-or-miss fashion. To
quantify the probability for this stochastic process, we
derived a ‘‘hit index’’ from the percentage of Ca2þ sparks
that were apparently triggered by the ﬁrst Ca2þ sparklets. The
hit index revealed a signiﬁcant decay from 67 6 2% in the
control to 46 6 3% in CHT and 36 6 2% in DHT (Figure
2D). As a backup of this result, we also parameterized a ‘‘miss
index’’ by counting the percentage of depolarization pulses
that occurred without triggering any Ca2þ sparks. The ‘‘bare’’
traces increased from 39 6 3% in the control to 59 6 2% in
CHT and 6762% in DHT (Figure 2E). Hit index and miss
index, based on independent statistics from the loose-patch
imaging data, showed congruously that the intermolecular
coupling efﬁciency between LCCs and RyRs decreased
signiﬁcantly not only in DHT, but also in CHT.
To further quantify the intermolecular aspects of E-C
coupling during hypertrophy, we went on to measure the
kinetics of LCC-RyR coupling. The LCC-RyR coupling latency
was gauged as the delay from the onset of an LCC sparklet to
the takeoff of a triggered RyR spark (Figure 3A). In each
experimental group, the coupling latency had a monotoni-
cally decaying distribution (Figure 3B). Exponential ﬁtting
showed that the time constant for LCC-RyR coupling
increased progressively from 4.5 6 0.3 ms to 5.7 6 0.4 ms
in CHT and to 6.7 6 0.3 ms in DHT (Figure 3C).
With the prolongation of LCC-RyR coupling latency, an
LCC Ca2þ sparklet with a limited lifetime would have a
decreased chance to activate RyR Ca2þ release. Therefore, the
slowed coupling kinetics agrees well with the decreased
chance of hit or increased chance of miss of LCC-RyR

coupling. Taken together, our data provide unequivocal
evidence that LCC-RyR coupling undergoes a progressive
failure during hypertrophy. Notably, this modiﬁcation occurs
not only in DHT, but also in CHT,
indicating that the
intermolecular failure starts as early as the compensated
stage, when the cellular E-C coupling appears intact.

Cellular Tolerance against Intermolecular Failure
How then, if at all, is LCC-RyR intermolecular failure
logically linked to the global performance of E-C coupling?
To seek an answer, we examined the cell-wide patterning of
Ca2þ release activities of
local Ca2þ release sites . We
performed whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments and dia-
lyzed into the cell 10 mM EGTA, a slow Ca2þ buffer that
integral of Ca2þ without
suppresses the spatiotemporal
interfering with CICR [19,20]. When the cell membrane was
depolarized to 0 mV, cell-wide Ca2þ release was visualized as a
line of discrete ‘‘Ca2þ spikes’’
[19,20]
(Figure 4A), each
occurring at a T-tubule–SR junction (identiﬁed by the bright
Z-line structure in the black-and-white strips next to the
images in Figure 4A). Notably, the Ca2þ spikes tended to be
desynchronized in the groups with hypertrophy. To quantify
this phenomenon , we measured the t ime de lay from
depolarization to the peak of each Ca2þ spike (Dspike,
illustrated in trace g of Figure 4B). We found that the time
distributions of Dspike became dispersed, with the peaks

shifting rightward in CHT and DHT in a progressive manner
(Figure 4C) . Accordingly ,
the average Dsp ike increased
signiﬁcantly in CHT and DHT (Figure 4D). These results,
consistent with the loose-patch data, provided independent
evidence that a microscopic defect of E-C coupling indeed
occurs as early as CHT.
The unique advantage of Ca2þ spike imaging is that it links
the local behavior of Ca2þ release to the global performance
of E-C coupling. Despite the desynchronization of Ca2þ
spikes, we found that the cell-wide time integral of Ca2þ
spikes in CHT could still reach a level similar to the control
(Figure 5A). In accordance, Ca2þ spikes could still be activated
at nearly 100% of T-tubules (Figure 5B). This phenomenon
suggested that within a certain limit, for which we adopted
the cybernetic term ‘‘stability margin,’’ the amount of cell-
wide Ca2þ release is stabilized against a moderate variation of
LCC-RyR intermolecular coupling efﬁciency. However, when
the failure of LCC-RyR coupling steps beyond the stability
margin, global performance of E-C coupling falls due to
insufﬁcient activation of Ca2þ release units (CRUs) (Figure
5B) and a degraded time integral of Ca2þ release (Figure 5A).
As a proof of principle, we simulated the dependence of
the fractional activation of CRUs (R) on the sensitivity (S) of
RyRs to LCC Ca2þ inﬂux (L). Based on the stochasticity of
LCC-RyR coupling [9], the R per unit time (dR/dt) relates
positively to L, S, and RyR availability. Due to the refractori-

where k represents the apparent rate constant for Ca2þ
removal from the cytosol. Assuming that both activation and
inactivation of LCCs follow exponential kinetics (Figure 6A),
Equation (1) predicts that, with the decrease of S, dR/dt
becomes reduced and dispersed (Figure 6B), reproducing the
data of Dspike in Figure 4C and 4D. Notably, despite the
progressive decrease in dR/dt, both R and C were initially
insensitive to S (red and orange lines in Figure 6C and 6D)
until the stability margin reached its edge (Figure 6E and 6F),
agreeing well with the data in Figure 5. Therefore, both
numerical simulation and experimental data support the idea
that a stability margin must be broached for global E-C
uncoupling to occur.
To test the above principle directly, we further designed an
experiment (Figure S2A) utilizing the principle that the LCC-
RyR coupling efﬁciency depends on the square of unitary
Ca2þ current [22]. When LCC unitary current was linearly
modulated by membrane voltage [9], the decrease of LCC-
RyR coupling efﬁciency resulted in a sigmoid relationship
between membrane voltage and Ca2þ transient amplitude
(Figure S2B), with the stability margin (light-colored bands in
Figure S2B) agreeing well with the simulated result (gray
bands in Figure 6F). Furthermore, the dynamic range of the
stability margin appeared as a function of the dwell time (T)
of ICa, which could also be reproduced by the simulation in
which slowed ICa inactivation (dashed line in Figure 6A)

Seeking Potential Mechanisms underlying the
Intermolecular Failure
In the present study, our results suggested that the
intermolecular failure started as early as the CHT stage,
when cellular E-C coupling still appeared intact. It was
therefore intriguing to explore the mechanism underlying
the intermolecular dysfunction. Many studies have shown
that SERCA activity is down-regulated, and Na/Ca exchange
up-regulated, in failing heart cells, both preventing the SR
from ﬁlling [8,11]. In order to test whether SR Ca2þ load plays
a role in the intermolecular coupling defect, we measured the
caffeine-induced Ca2þ transients using a lower-afﬁnity Ca2þ
indicator, ﬂuo-5F, to avoid indicator saturation [23]. How-
ever, as previously reported for other hypertrophy models
[13,24], we could not identify a difference in SR Ca2þ load in
resting cells of the control, CHT, and DHT groups (Figure
S3).
It has been postulated that a structural rearrangement
between SR and cell/T-tubule membrane may underlie the

defective E-C coupling in failing heart cells [13]. Many
laboratories found that the T-tubule structure indeed under-
goes structural degradation during heart failure [25,26],
leaving RyRs orphaned [27]. However, when we used the
same method [27] to examine LCC-RyR co-localization
(Figure S4A), we could not detect a change in our hyper-
trophy models (Figure S4B), indicating that the membrane
restructuring observed in the late, failing stage could not be
detected in the early, hypertrophy stage. To explore whether
any molecular event related to structural uncoupling accom-
panies the onset of intermolecular failure, we examined in
the CHT group the expression of junctophilin-2 (JP-2), a
protein anchoring SR to cell/T-tubule membrane and being
down-regulated in mouse models of dilated cardiomyopathy
[28]. Quantitative analysis using real-time reverse transcrip-
tase PCR (RT-PCR) showed that JP-2 mRNA expression,
normalized by GAPDH, was signiﬁcantly decreased in CHT
(Figure 7). Therefore, despite the absence of an apparent
structural modiﬁcation, a subtle physical alteration associ-
ated with decreased JP-2 expression is expected to contribute
to the earliest change in LCC-RyR coupling efﬁciency.

Ca Signaling Failure in Hypertrophy

Direct Determinants of E-C Coupling
The development of hypertrophy and heart failure is a
progressive remodeling characterized by increased wall
thickness,
impaired diastolic function, excessive ﬁbrosis,
increased myocardial stiffness, and altered expression of
genes encoding contractile, regulatory, and structural pro-
teins [1–4]. The present study has been focused on the
mechanisms that modify Ca2þ transient generation, which
depends directly on the following factors:
LCC activity: Depending on different models, LCC activity
is found to be either increased, decreased, or unchanged
during the transition from hypertrophy to heart failure
[13,14]. Our data in Figure 1E and 1G support the idea that
LCC regulation does not play a major role in the modiﬁcation
of E-C coupling during hypertrophy.
Ca2þ release from RyRs: Depolarization-induced Ca2þ
transients can be explained by the spatiotemporal summation
of Ca2þ sparks [29 ,30] . Spontaneous Ca2þ sparks with
increased amplitude were found in hypertrophied sponta-
neously hypertensive rats [24], but not in salt-sensitive rats
[13]. In the present model of hypertrophy, Ca2þ sparks were
triggered by LCC Ca2þ inﬂux. We identiﬁed no difference in
Ca2þ spark parameters, but found a desynchronization of
Ca2þ spike patterning. Desynchronized Ca2þ release has been
found previously in heart failure [31,32], and attributed in
part to an absence of early repolarization in the action
potential [32]. Here we show that desynchronization of Ca2þ
release has already begun in CHT, and is induced by
decreased efﬁciency of LCC-RyR coupling.
Efﬁc iency of LCC-RyR coupling : The degraded E-C
coupling gain with unchanged ICa and Ca2þ sparks lead to
the idea that the efﬁciency of the LCC current to activate RyR
Ca2þ release may be decreased [13]. Here, using a loose-patch
spark imaging technique, we provided direct evidence that
the coupling kinetics between a single LCC and RyRs is

Discussion

The present study aimed to establish the intermolecular
basis for the modiﬁed E-C coupling during hypertrophy that
eventually leads to heart failure. Using rat models of CHT and
DHT, we characterized the cardiac E-C coupling at the
cellular, sub-cellular, and intermolecular levels. For DHT, our
data provided the molecular interpretation that the slowed
response of RyR to unitary LCC triggers results in an
increased chance of failure in LCC-RyR coupling, which then
leads to a degradation in intracellular Ca2þ transients. For
CHT, we found unexpectedly that intermolecular failure
proceeds in the background without altering cellular func-
tion of E-C coupling. The latter is of prominent clinical
signiﬁcance, as it demonstrated a hint of pathogenesis at a
very early stage of heart failure.

Ca Signaling Failure in Hypertrophy

junctional structure may severely alter LCC-RyR signaling
efﬁciency. In heart failure models, structural degradation is
found in the T-tubule system [25,26],
leaving many RyRs
orphaned [27]. Associated with the structural change, JP-2, a
protein that anchors junctional SR to cell membrane, is
down-regulated in cardiomyopathy models showing de-
creased Ca2þ transients but normal ICa [28]. In the present
study, we examined an earlier stage of hypertrophy exhibiting
normal Ca2þ transients and contractility. Although a struc-
tural change was not yet detectable, we did see that JP-2
expression was curtailed by half.
Taken together, LCC-RyR coupling efﬁciency is a multi-
factorial issue. Presently, the structural/ultrastructural mod-
iﬁcation associated with decreased JP-2 expression, which
would physically uncouple LCCs and RyRs,
is the most
plausible mechanism underlying the functional coupling
failure between LCCs and RyRs. Therefore, the upstream
pathways that regulate JP-2 may become putative candidates
for therapeutic targeting against heart failure.

Relationship between Global Performance and
Intermolecular Failure
An interesting ﬁnding in the present study is that
intermolecular failure of LCC-RyR signaling occurs as early
as CHT when global E-C coupling appears intact. This ﬁnding
is backed up by several
independent lines of evidence,
including (1) decreased chance of hit, (2) increased chance
of miss, (3) the prolonged latency of LCC-RyR coupling, and
(4) the prolonged delay and progressive temporal dispersion
of cell-wide Ca2þ spikes. An intriguing question is why and to
what extent cellular E-C coupling is capable of tolerating
intermolecular failure.
In heart cells, the intermolecular coupling between LCCs
and RyRs is intrinsically stochastic, rather than deterministic
[9]. The beauty of such a mode of control is that a RyR CRU
that once fails to respond to an LCC opening still has a
similar chance to be activated by later LCC openings [9]. In
the present study, we demonstrated that slowed kinetics and
increased chance of miss in LCC-RyR coupling in CHT did
not alter the time integral of Ca2þ spikes (Figure 5A),
suggesting that even when the CRUs are less responsive, they
are sufﬁciently activated before ICa inactivation at the
expense of Ca2þ release desynchronization. This speculation
is fully supported by our numerical simulation. With the
decrease of S, although the dR/dt (CRU activation per unit
time) becomes lower in peak, it lasts longer in time (Figure
6B). Within the stability margin, these two trends compensate
for each other, keeping the cumulative CRU activation (R)
relatively unchanged. However, with further decrease of LCC-
RyR coupling efﬁciency, an increasing fraction of CRUs tends
not to be activated before ICa inactivation (Figure 5B; green,
blue, and black lines in Figure 6C); global performance of
Ca2þ release declines.
In testing the principle that a stability margin must be
broached for cellular uncoupling to occur, we found that
decreasing LCC-RyR coupling efﬁciency by a factor other
than hypertrophy obeyed the same principle. Therefore, the
stability margin principle has general meaning in linking the
intermolecular aspect and the global aspect of E-C coupling.
In addition, both experimental and numerical data support
the idea that prolonged ICa exposure can extend the stability
margin (Figure 6E and Figure S2B). With an extended

Sham-Operated and CHT Rats
RNA of JP-2 was quantified by real-time quantitative RT-PCR; the
expression of JP-2 relative to GAPDH was found to be significantly lower
in the control (0.089 6 0.010) compared to CHT (0.046 6 0.007) group (n
¼ 4 rats). Double asterisks (**) indicate p , 0.01 compared with control.

slowed during hypertrophy, resulting in a status of inter-
molecular failure. Moreover, we demonstrated that the
deﬁciency occurs as early as CHT when the cellular perform-
ance of E-C coupling appears normal.
Based on the above discussion, we believe that decreased
LCC-RyR coupling efﬁciency is a major problem of E-C
coupling in hypertrophy, and also may represent the earliest
functional hint that heart failure is developing.

Factors underlying LCC-RyR Coupling Efficiency
To understand the modiﬁcation of LCC-RyR coupling
efﬁciency, the following aspects need to be considered:
SR lumenal regulation: SR Ca2þ load not only determines
the amount of releasable Ca2þ, but also modulates the RyR
sensitivity to Ca2þ [8]. In many heart failure models, decreased
SR Ca2þ load [33,34] due to reduced expression of SERCA
protein [11,33] or impaired SERCA regulation by phospho-
lamban [35,36] are responsible, at least in part, for the E-C
uncoupling. Improving SR Ca2þ uptake function by expres-
sion of SERCA or the pseudophosphorylated mutant of
phospholamban can indeed improve the cardiac perform-
ance in heart failure models [37,38]. Even though, in many
failing models [13,24,39], including the hypertrophy models
in the present study (Figure S3), resting cardiomyocytes with
a normal SR Ca2þ load still exhibit degraded efﬁciency for
LCC Ca2þ inﬂux to activate Ca2þ transients, suggesting that an
SR load-independent mechanism also underlies the defective
E-C coupling.
Molecular Modulation of RyRs: In failing hearts, it has been
found that RyRs are hyperphosphorylated, and the resulting
dissociation of FKBP12.6 is a major cause of the defective E-C
coupling [10,40]. Recently, contrary evidence has also been
presented [41]. Therefore, whether the defective LCC-RyR
coupling involves RyR modiﬁcation is still under debate.
Structural coupling with LCCs: It has been postulated [42],
and recently simulated [43], that the local Ca2þ concentration
generated by LCCs and ‘‘seen’’ by RyRs varies by orders of
magnitude with the distance between junctional SR and
surface/T-tubule membrane. Hence, even a subtle change in

stability margin,
the global performances become less
inﬂuenced by intermolecular failure. Therefore, ﬁnding
strategies that extend the stability margin, e.g., by targeting
LCC inactivation, may have potential implications in devel-
oping therapeutic treatments against heart failure.

Materials and Methods

Aortic stenosis model. Ascending aortic stenosis surgery was
performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight, 50–55 g,
obtained from the Medical Experimental Animal Center of Peking
University) as described previously [17]. Brieﬂy, rats were anesthe-
tized with a ketamine-xylazine mixture (5:3, 1.32 mg/kg intra-
peritoneally). The thorax was opened and a silver clip (0.9-mm
inside diameter) was placed on the ascending aorta. Sham-operated
animals underwent an identical procedure but without the clip. To
characterize the model, echocardiographic measurements were made
using a Vivid 7 Dimension cardiovascular ultrasound system (GE
Healthcare, Fairﬁeld, Connecticut, United States) as described
previously [43]. A 2.0-F high-ﬁdelity nanometer-tipped catheter
(SPR-838; Millar Instruments, Houston, Texas, United States) was
introduced through the right carotid artery and retrogradely across
the aortic valve in the left ventricle to measure hemodynamic
parameters [43]. The parameters measured are listed in Table S1.
Whole-cell patch clamp. Single ventricular myocytes were isolated
using an enzymatic method described previously [44]. The cells were
bathed in an extracellular solution containing (in mM): 137 NaCl, 4.0
KCl, 1.0 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 0.02 tetrodotoxin,
and 10 HEPES, (pH 7.35) adjusted with NaOH. An EPC7 ampliﬁer
(List Medical Electronic, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for the
whole-cell patch clamp technique. For Ca2þ transient measurement,
the patch pipette ﬁlling solution contained (in mM): 127 CsCl, 10
NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 MgATP, 15 tetraethylammonium chloride, 10
HEPES, and 0.2 ﬂuo-4 pentapotassium (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
Oregon, United States), (pH 7.2) adjusted with CsOH. When Ca2þ
spikes occurring at T-tubules were measured, 10 mM EGTA and 4 mM
CaCl2 were included in the pipette solution with the CsCl decreased
to 115 mM. ICa was activated by 200-ms depolarization pulses at 10-s
intervals.
Loose-seal patch clamp. The loose-seal patch clamp technique, as
described previously [9], was performed using the same setup as in the
whole-cell patch clamp. A glass pipette with a resistance (Rp) of 3–5 MX
(;1 lm at the tip) was gently pressed onto the cell surface to form a low-
resistance seal (Rs ¼ 20–30 M). The patch membrane voltage (VP) was
determined based on resting potential (RP) and command voltage (Vcom)
by VP ¼ RP   VcomRs/(RsþRp). The pipettes were ﬁlled with extracellular
solution except that 20 mM Ca2þ and 10 lM FPL64176 were included to
facilitate the visualization of Ca2þ sparklets from LCCs.
Confocal imaging. For whole-cell experiments, the Ca2þ indicator
ﬂuo-4 was already in the pipette solution. To load ﬂuo-4 in loose-
patch experiments, cells were incubated in 2.5 lM ﬂuo-4 AM
(Molecular Probes) in extracellular solution for about 5 min in the
dark at 37 8C. Ca2þ transients, Ca2þ spikes from individual T-tubules,
and Ca2þ sparks were measured using a Zeiss LSM-510 inverted
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). All image
myocyte excited at 488 nm. The Ca2þ level was reported as F/F0,
data were taken in the line-scanning mode along the long axis of the
where F0 is the resting or diastolic ﬂuo-4 ﬂuorescence.
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA from
isolated ventricular myocytes was extracted using Trizol reagent, and
ﬁrst-strand cDNA was generated using the ImProm-II Transcription
System (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States). Quantitative
real-time RT-PCR was performed using the primers of junctophilin
type-2 (59-AGGCGGGTGCCAAGAAGAAG-39; 59-CGATGTTCAG-
CAGGATCACCA-39) and GAPDH (59-ATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG-
CA-39; 59-AAGGTGGAAGAATGGGAGTTG  39). Ampliﬁcations were
performed in 35 cycles using an Opticon continuous ﬂuorescence
detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, United States) with
SYBR Green ﬂuorescence (Molecular Probes). Each cycle consisted of
30 s at 94 8C, 30 s at 56 8C, and 30 s at 72 8C. All samples were
quantiﬁed using the comparative Ct method for relative quantitation
of gene expression, normalized to GAPDH [45].

Statistical analysis. Results are expressed as mean plus or minus the
standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed
using the Student t-test for unpaired samples; a value of p , 0.05 was
considered signiﬁcant. When ﬁtted data were compared, their
difference was divided by the standard error and compared with
the standard normal distribution. During the experiments, we
considered the time difference between CHT (7–9 wk after surgery)
and DHT (9–11 wk). Sham-operated controls were set for each group.
As the data from these two control groups did not differ signiﬁcantly,
they were combined together as the ‘‘control’’ group in this
manuscript.
