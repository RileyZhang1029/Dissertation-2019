2 Resveratrol (RV), a naturally occurring stilbene derivative, is a potent free radical scavenger
causing a number of biochemical and antineoplastic effects. It was shown to induce differentiation
and apoptosis in leukemia cells and was also identiﬁed as an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase
(RR), a key enzyme of DNA synthesis.
In this study, we report about the biochemical effects of RV in HL-60 human promyelocytic
leukemia cells. RV effectively inhibited in situ RR activity. Furthermore, incubation of HL-60 cells
with RV signiﬁcantly decreased intracellular dCTP, dTTP, dATP and dGTP concentrations. In
growth inhibition and clonogenic assays, RV acted synergistically with both Ara-C and tiazofurin
in HL-60 cells. We conclude that RV could become a viable candidate as one compound in the
combination chemotherapy of leukemia and therefore deserves further in vitro and in vivo testing.

INTRODUCTION

The biochemical effects of RV have been subject to intense studies, and
it is understood that its antitumor activity has multifactorial causes. It has
been shown that RV is an effective inhibitor of the enzyme ribonucleotide
reductase (RR, EC1.17.4.1),[ 1 ] which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of de

novo DNA synthesis. The enzyme is signiﬁcantly upregulated in malignant
cells, which makes RR an excellent target for cancer chemotherapy.
We now revealed that RV depletes dNTP concentrations including dCTP
and dGTP pools and that it is able to effectively inhibit the incorporation
of 14C-labelled cytidine into DNA. Furthermore, it was tested whether
a combination of RV and Ara-C or RV and tiazofurin also could yield
synergistic cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in human HL-60 promyelocytic
leukemia cells. The results of these experiments could lead to additional
options for chemotherapy of human leukemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Chemicals and Cell Culture

All chemicals used were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria.
Tiazofurin was kindly provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI
Bethesda, MD).
The HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line was purchased from
ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA).

Growth Inhibition Assays

HL-60 cells were incubated with various concentrations of RV for
72 hours. To determine the IC50 value of RV, cells were then counted.
To analyze the combination effects of RV with Ara-C, HL-60 cells were
simultaneously incubated with various concentrations of RV and Ara-C or
tiazofurin, while keeping the combination ratio constant.

Determination of Deoxynucleoside-Triphosphates

Logarithmically growing HL-60 cells were incubated with RV for
24 hours and dNTPs were extracted as described by Garrett and Santi.[ 2 ]
dNTPs were measured using a Merck “La Chrom” HPLC system equipped
with an L-7200 autosampler, an L-7100 pump, an L-7400 UV detector, and a
D-7000 inter face. The concentration of dNTPs was calculated as percent of
control.

Incorporation of 14C-Labelled Cytidine into DNA

To analyze the effect of RV incubation on the in situ activity of ribonu-
cleotide reductase, an assay was per formed as described previously.[ 3 ]

Hoechst Dye 33258 and Propidium Iodide Double Staining

After incubation for 48 hours with various concentrations of RV and
Ara-C or tiazofurin, cells were stained with Hoechst dye 33258 (5 µg/ml)

and propidium iodide (2 µg/ml), examined by ﬂuorescence microscopy
using DAPI ﬁlters and judged according to their morphology, cell mem-
brane integrity and presence of apoptotic bodies. Results are presented as
percentage of total cell count exhibiting apoptotic features.

Statistical Calculations and Calculation of Synergism

The calculations of combination effects were per formed using the
“Calcusyn” software designed by Chou and Talalay[ 4 ] (Biosoft, Ferguson,
MO, USA). Synergistic combination effects are indicated by a combination
index <1. Signiﬁcant differences were calculated by t-test using the Prism
3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

RESULTS

Changes in Intracellular Concentrations of dNTPs after Treatment
with Resveratrol

All dNTP pools were signiﬁcantly decreased compared with untreated
controls after incubation with 12.5 µM RV for 24 hours (69%, 61%, 26%,
and 30% of control for dCTP, dTTP, dATP, and dGTP concentrations, re-
spectively). Incubation with 6.25 µM RV signiﬁcantly decreased intracellular
dTTP and dGTP pools to 56% and 24% of control values, respectively.

Inhibition of Incorporation of 14C-cytidine into DNA

After treatment of HL-60 cells with 12.5, 25, and 50 µM RV for 24 hours,
14C-cytidine incorporation into DNA was signiﬁcantly decreased to 45%,
31.5%, and 2.5% of control values, respectively. Results are shown in
Figure 1.

the concentrations applied. Combination of RV and tiazofurin doses below

Induction of Apoptosis

All three compounds, RV, Ara-C and tiazofurin induced apoptosis in
a dose-dependent manner. However, RV was capable to synergistically
enhance the number of apoptotic cells in combination with either Ara-C

DISCUSSION

In the present study, we could show that RV inhibits in situ RR activity
in human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells.[ 5 , 6 ] In addition, we revealed
that RV decreased all four intracellular dNTP concentrations, the products
of RR. By inhibition of RR it is possible to speciﬁcally target rapidly
proliferating tumor cells without affecting normal cells. In combinations
with Ara-C and tiazofurin, RV could synergistically enhance the cytotoxic
effects of these compounds. Being an ingredient of grapes and wine, RV,
therefore, might have limited toxic side effects.
The use of RV might be a promising additional option for combination
treatment of human leukemia. Based on our data, in vivo studies using RV
in combination with compounds like Ara-C or tiazofurin, for chemotherapy
of leukemia should be reasonable.
