Summary

The small GTPase Rap1 induces integrin-mediated ad-
hesion and changes in the actin cytoskeleton. The
mechanisms that mediate these effects of Rap1 are
poorly understood. We have identified RIAM as a
Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule. RIAM de-
fines a family of adaptor molecules that contain a RA-
like (Ras association) domain, a PH (pleckstrin homol-
ogy) domain, and various proline-rich motifs. RIAM
also interacts with Profilin and Ena/VASP proteins,
molecules that regulate actin dynamics. Overexpres-
sion of RIAM induced cell spreading and lamellipodia
formation, changes that require actin polymerization.
In contrast, RIAM knockdown cells had reduced con-
tent of polymerized actin. RIAM overexpression also
induced integrin activation and cell adhesion. RIAM
knockdown displaced Rap1-GTP from the plasma
membrane and abrogated Rap1-induced adhesion.
Thus, RIAM links Rap1 to integrin activation and plays
a role in regulating actin dynamics.

Rap1-GTP regulates LFA-1-mediated adhesion upon
TCR, CD31, or CD98 ligation (Katagiri et al., 2000; Reed-
quist et al., 2000; Suga et al., 2001). Rap1 is also involved
in chemokine-induced ␤2 and ␣4 integrin activation and
T cell migration (Shimonaka et al., 2003). However, the
mechanism that links Rap1 to integrin activation re-
mains unclear.
Profilin and Ena/VASP family proteins are important
regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Profilin associates
with G-actin and promotes nucleotide exchange to cre-
ate Profilin-Actin (ATP) complexes. When bound by Pro-
filin, actin monomer is added only to the barbed ends of
F-actin (Pollard and Borisy, 2003). The Ena/VASP family
members Mena, VASP, and Evl are recruited to sites of
actin cytoskeleton remodeling such as lamellipodia, filo-
podia, focal contacts, and the T cell:APC contact site
(Krause et al., 2003). They contain an EVH1 domain that
interacts with the proline-rich motif (D/E)(F/L/W/Y)PPPPX
(D/E)(D/E) (abbreviated as FPPPP) present in proteins
such as Zyxin and Vinculin that target Ena/VASP pro-
teins to focal adhesions (Niebuhr et al., 1997) or in Fyb/
SLAP that recruits Ena/VASP to the T cell:APC interface
(Krause et al., 2000; Renfranz and Beckerle, 2002). They
also have proline-rich regions that bind to SH3 domain-
containing proteins and to Profilin, and an EVH2 domain
that mediates their tetramerization and interacts with G-
and F-actin (Krause et al., 2003).
Here, we report the cloning and the structural and
functional characterization of RIAM, an interactor of
Rap1-GTP. Overexpression of RIAM promoted the ac-
tive conformation of ␤1 and ␤2 integrin and integrin-
mediated adhesion. Knockdown of RIAM expression
displaced Rap1-GTP from the plasma membrane and
reverted Rap1-induced adhesion. RIAM also interacted
with Profilin and Ena/VASP proteins. Overexpression of
RIAM induced changes in actin cytoskeleton, reflected
by increased cell spreading and lamellipodia formation.
In contrast, RIAM knockdown cells had reduced poly-
merized actin content. Therefore, RIAM plays a key role
in Rap1-induced adhesion and interacts with modula-
tors of the actin cytoskeleton.

Introduction

Results

The small GTPase Rap1 (Krev-1), a member of the Ras
superfamily, was identified by its ability to revert K-Ras-
induced transformation (Kitayama et al., 1989). Recent
data indicate that Rap1 does not simply antagonize Ras
function. In mammalian cells, Rap1 plays a role in cell
adhesion and spreading. Fibroblasts deficient for C3G,
a Rap1-GEF, display impaired adhesion and accelerated
migration, phenotypes that can be reversed by overex-
pression of the Rap1-GEFs CalDAG-GEFI or Epac (Ohba
et al., 2001). Similarly, a dominant-negative form of C3G
blocked HGF-induced Rap1 activation and adhesion
(Sakkab et al., 2000), as did overexpression of the Rap1-
GAP Spa1 (Tsukamoto et al., 1999). In lymphoid cells,

Identification of RIAM as a Rap1-Interacting Protein
To search for Rap1-interacting molecules in T cells, we
used the constitutively GTP bound mutant Rap1E63 (Ki-
tayama et al., 1990) as a bait to screen a Jurkat cDNA
library using yeast two-hybrid system. We isolated sev-
eral clones encoding for RGL2, a known interactor of
Rap1 (Peterson et al., 1996), along with clones encoding
partial cDNAs with homology to mouse PRP48 (AF020313).
We named this protein RIAM for Rap1-GTP-interacting
adaptor molecule (AY152730). Later, sequences encoding
for this protein were deposited (NM_019043). RIAM also
has homology to a human clone (LOC54518) that is iden-
tical to RIAM residues 1–261 except for its last 27 amino
acids (aa), suggesting that it is a splice variant of RIAM.
The open reading frame of RIAM is 1998 bp and en-
codes a protein of 665 aa. The human RIAM gene locus is

on chromosome 10p12.1. Northern blot analysis showed
that RIAM, like Rap1, is expressed broadly (Figure 1A).
Two transcripts of 5.4 and 2.8 Kb were detected in im-
mune tissues. In nonimmune tissues, the larger tran-
script predominated. We raised rabbit polyclonal anti-
bodies against the C and N termini of RIAM that
recognized a 110 kDa band in Western blots of various
cell types (Figure 1B). In vitro translation of full-length
RIAM cDNA produced a protein of 110 kDa (Figure 2B),
confirming that the protein recognized by our antibody
is RIAM.

Sequence analysis indicated that RIAM contains a RA
(RalGDS/AF-6 or Ras-association) domain, a PH (pleck-
strin homology) domain, and two proline-rich regions.
Two putative coiled-coil regions are present at the N
terminus (aa 62–89 and aa 149–181) (Figure 1C).

RIAM Belongs to the MRL Family
of Adaptor Molecules
Database searches revealed that RIAM has similarities
with Grb7, Grb10, and Grb14 adaptor molecules. The
protein with highest homology to RIAM is Lamellipodin
(Lpd)
(KIAA1681, AY494951) and Lpd-S (ALS2CR9,
BAB69020), characterized in the accompanying article
by Krause et al. (2004 [this issue of Developmental Cell]).
Furthermore, RIAM is related to proteins CG11940
(AAF49029) in D. melanogaster and Mig-10 (P34400) in
C. elegans (Figure 1C).
Comparison of the domain structure of these proteins
indicated that they comprise two distinct families (Figure
1C). Grb7-related proteins have a conserved central re-
gion containing a RA domain and a PH domain (Manser
and Wood, 1990; Wojcik et al., 1999), a Src homology
2 (SH2) domain at their C-terminal region, and a “be-
tween PH and SH2” (BPS) domain (Han et al., 2001). In
contrast, RIAM, Lpd, CG11940, and Mig-10 lack SH2
and BPS domains and have a proline-rich region at the
C terminus. Moreover, all proteins in the latter group
contain a highly conserved pattern of 27 aa predicted
to be a coiled-coil region immediately N-terminal of the
RA domain. In addition, comparison of the RA and PH
domains shows differences between the Grb7/10/14-
and RIAM-related proteins and conserved regions
among the proteins within each group (Supplemental Fig-
u re S1 a t h t tp : / /www .deve lopmen ta lce l l .com /cg i /
content/full/7/4/585/DC1/). Dendrograms of sequence
relatedness of full-length protein (Figure 1D), the RA and
PH domains (data not shown), confirmed that Grb7- and
RIAM-related proteins are separated into two distinct
families. We propose to name the family of RIAM-related
adaptor molecules the MRL (Mig-10/RIAM/Lpd) family.

RIAM Interacts with Rap1-GTP In Vitro and In Vivo
We examined the specificity of the RIAM-Rap1 interac-
tion and its dependence on the activation state of Rap1.
In a two-hybrid assay, yeast was cotransformed with
RIAM with either Rap1WT, the GTP bound mutants
Rap1E63 and Rap1V12, or Rap1N17, a mutant that re-
mains in nucleotide-free state. Interaction was observed
with Rap1V12, Rap1E63, and Rap1WT but not with
Rap1N17 (Figure 2A). As previously reported, when
transformed in yeast, Rap1WT is mostly in GTP bound
state (McCabe et al., 1992). Only a weak interaction was
observed when RIAM was cotransformed with RasV12
(Figure 2A), suggesting that RIAM preferentially inter-
acted with Rap1-GTP compared to Ras-GTP. Since
Rap1 and Ras share identical effector domains, se-
quences outside the Rap1 effector domain may contrib-
ute to the preferential binding of RIAM with Rap1. When
RIAM was cotransformed with RalA, RalB, Rho, Cdc42,
and Rac, interaction was not detected (data not shown,
see accompanying article by Krause et al. [2004]).
The RIAM/Rap1 interaction was tested by in vitro pro-
tein association assay (Figure 2B). GST-Rap1WT, GST-
Rap1E63, and GST coupled to glutahione-sepharose

RIAM together with the indicated constructs.
LexA and Bicoid were used as negative con-
trols.
(B) Purified fusion proteins and GST control
were analyzed by Coomassie staining (top

Interactions between the indicated
proteins and [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro
translated RIAM (middle panel) or Luciferase
(lower panel) were examined by SDS-PAGE
and exposure on film. In vitro translated RIAM
and Luciferase are shown as controls.
(C) COS cells were cotransfected with HA-
RIAM and either empty vector, Rap1WT, or
Rap1E63. Immunoprecipitations were done
with anti-HA followed by immunoblot with
Rap1 antiserum (first panel) or with Rap1 anti-
serum followed by immunoblot with anti-HA
mAb (second panel). Equal amounts of whole-
cell lysates (WCL) were immunobloted with
anti-Rap1 and anti-HA antibodies (third and
fourth panels).
(D) Jurkat cells were transfected with HA-
RIAM and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. Cell
extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-
HA antibody and sequentially immunobloted
with HA mAb and Rap1 antiserum. Rap1 acti-
vation was determined by pull-down assays
using GST-RalGDS-RBD (third panel). To con-
firm cell activation, the same samples were
immunoblotted with anti-pERK1/2 antibody
(fourth panel) and with ERK1/2-specific anti-
serum (fifth panel).

were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled RIAM or
Luciferase, as negative control. RIAM bound preferen-
tially to Rap1E63, whereas binding to Rap1WT was al-
most undetectable. Binding to Luciferase was not de-
tected (Figure 2B, lower panel).
To examine whether RIAM interacted with Rap1
in vivo, HA-tagged RIAM was expressed in COS cells
with empty vector, Rap1WT, or Rap1E63. Immunopre-
cipitation with anti-HA antibody followed by Rap1 immu-
noblot and reciprocal immunoprecipitation with Rap1
antiserum followed by anti-HA immunoblot
(Figure
2C) showed that RIAM preferentially interacted with
Rap1E63. When RIAM was coexpressed with RasV12,
only minimal amounts of Ras interacted with RIAM (data
not shown). Thus in vivo, RIAM preferentially interacts
with Rap1-GTP as compared to Ras-GTP. Interaction
of RIAM with Rap1-GTP was also detected upon physio-
logical stimulation. Jurkat T cells transfected with HA-
RIAM were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb (Figure 2D).
Rap1 activation was monitored by pull-down assay with
GST-RalGDS-RBD followed by Western blot with Rap1
antiserum (Reedquist and Bos, 1998). Immunoprecipita-
tions with anti-HA antibody followed by Rap1 immu-
noblot indicated that RIAM interacted with endogenous
Rap1 after formation of Rap1-GTP (Figure 2D). Thus,
RIAM interacts only with Rap1-GTP, suggesting that it
is a Rap1-effector.
To determine the region of RIAM that associates with
Rap1, we generated truncation mutants and assayed
them for interaction with Rap1 by yeast two-hybrid (Sup-
plemental Figure S2). Only RIAM fragments containing

both RA and PH domains interacted with Rap1-GTP
(RIAM 150–665, RIAM 150–503, RIAM 150–430). Resi-
dues 1–150 enhanced this interaction as RIAM 1–503 or
full-length RIAM interacted with Rap1 more robustly
than RIAM 150–665. Thus, the RIAM RA-like and PH
domains together are necessary and sufficient for inter-
action with Rap1-GTP, and N-terminal RIAM sequences
enhance this interaction.

RIAM Interacts with Ena/VASP Proteins
and Profilin
RIAM is proline-rich (12.9%) and contains six putative
Profilin binding motifs (XPPPPP) and six putative EVH1
binding motifs (D/E)(F/L/W/Y)PPPPX(D/E)(D/E) (Figure
3A; Niebuhr et al., 1997), suggesting that RIAM may
interact with Profilin and EVH1 domain-containing pro-
teins. In addition, RIAM contains binding motifs for SH3
and WW domain-containing proteins (Holt and Koffer,
2001).
Using the yeast two-hybrids, we detected a strong
interaction between RIAM and Profilin of similar intensity
to that between RIAM and active Rap1 (Figure 3B). We
also detected interaction between RIAM and VASP by
in vitro association assay. GST and GST-fusion proteins
of VASP or VASP mutant (VASP⌬) in which the Profilin
binding region of VASP (Gertler et al., 1996) was elimi-
nated were coupled to glutathione-sepharose and incu-
bated with [35S]methionine-labeled RIAM or Luciferase,
as control. Both VASP and VASP⌬ bound to RIAM (Fig-
ure 3C),
indicating that RIAM interacts directly with
VASP.

shown in gray boxes and six putative EVH1
binding motifs are shown underlined.
(B) The yeast was cotransformed with full-
length RIAM and either Profilin or with
Rap1E63 as positive control. B42AD and VPR
were used as negative controls. Colonies
from each transformation were assayed for
␤-galactosidase activity.
(C) The indicated purified GST-fusion pro-
teins and GST were visualized by Coomassie
staining (top panel). Interactions between the
indicated proteins
and [35S]methionine-
labeled in vitro translated RIAM or Luciferase
were examined by SDS-PAGE and exposure
on film (middle and bottom panel). In vitro
translated RIAM and luciferase are shown
as controls.
(D) Cell extracts from primary T cells either
unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3 and
anti-CD28 mAbs were immunoprecipitated
with RIAM antibody (left panels) or with con-
trol IgG (right panels) followed by immunoblot
with VASP, Evl, Profilin, and RIAM antibodies.
(E) COS cells were cotransfected with HA-
Profilin and Rap1E63 with either Myc-RIAM
or empty vector, and immunoprecipitations
were done with anti-HA mAb followed by im-
munoblot with Rap1, HA, and Myc antibodies.
Equivalent amounts of whole-cell
lysates
(WCL) were used as controls for Rap1E63 and
HA-Profilin expression.

To determine if RIAM interacts with Profilin and Ena/
VASP in vivo, we immunoprecipitated RIAM from pri-
mary human T cell extracts. Coimmunoprecipitation of
Profilin, VASP, and Evl with endogenous RIAM was de-
tected prior and after stimulation via TCR/CD3 and
CD28, indicating that these interactions are constitutive
in T cells (Figure 3D).

RIAM Is a Link between Rap1-GTP and Profilin
Rap1-GTP localizes at the T cell:APC interface (Katagiri
et al., 2002) and is involved in integrin activation (Katagiri
et al., 2000; Reedquist et al., 2000). These events require
reorganization of the cytoskeleton. However, the mech-
anism that regulates docking of Rap1 to the cytoskele-
ton has not been determined. Our observation that RIAM
associates with Ena/VASP and Profilin suggests that
RIAM might provide a link between Rap1-GTP and the
cytoskeleton. Therefore, we examined whether Rap1-
GTP, RIAM, and Profilin may be present in complexes.
HA-Profilin and Rap1E63 were expressed in COS cells
with either Myc-RIAM or empty vector. Immunoprecipi-
tation with anti-HA antibody followed by immunoblot

with Rap1 antiserum (Figure 3E, first panel) showed that
Rap1 was present in a complex with Profilin (Figure
3E, second panel) only when RIAM was expressed, as
indicated by immunoblot with anti-Myc antibody (Figure
3E, third panel). These results indicate that RIAM can
function as a link between Rap1-GTP and the actin regu-
lator Profilin either by direct RIAM binding to Profilin or
by RIAM recruitment of Ena/VASP-Profilin complexes.

RIAM Colocalizes with F-Actin and Induces
Cell Spreading
The interaction between RIAM and the regulators of
actin polymerization, Profilin and Ena/VASP, prompted
us to determine the effect of RIAM on the actin cytoskel-
eton. HEK293 cells stably transfected with RIAM or
empty vector were examined by confocal microscopy.
As shown in Figure 4, cells overexpressing RIAM were
more spread and had almost double the area of controls
(HEK293 RIAM ⫽ 1760 ⫾ 310 ␮m2, n ⫽ 50; HEK293

antibody revealed that RIAM is distributed throughout

Lamellipodia Formation
HEK293 and Jurkat T cells stably transfected
with empty vector or with RIAM were seeded
on fibronectin (HEK293) or poly-Lysine (Jur-
kat). Cells were fixed, stained, and analyzed
by confocal microscopy. RIAM was visual-
ized with RIAM-specific antibody (green) and
polymerized (F)-actin was detected with Cy5-
Phalloidin (red). Points of RIAM localization

bars equal 50 ␮m for HEK293 cells and 10
␮m for Jurkat cells.

the cytoplasm and at the leading edge where it colocal-
izes with F-actin (Figure 4, arrows). This localization of
RIAM is consistent with the reported localization of Ena/
VASP proteins at the leading edge (Gertler et al., 1996;
Rottner et al., 1999), where they are recruited to the fast
growing ends of actin filaments (Bear et al., 2002; also
see accompanying article by Krause et al. [2004]).
To determine whether cell spreading was induced by
overexpression of RIAM in other cell types, we stably
transfected Jurkat T cells with RIAM or empty vector.
RIAM-transfected Jurkat cells formed extensive lamelli-
podia (Figure 4). In these cells, RIAM was detected in
the perinuclear region and at the leading edge (Figure
4, bottom row, arrow).

RIAM Induces ␤1 and ␤2 Integrin-Mediated Adhesion
Rap1-GTP induces ␤1 and ␤2 integrin-mediated ad-
hesion in T cells. To determine if RIAM had a similar ef-
fect, stable Jurkat T cell lines transfected with RIAM,

Rap1E63, or empty vector were added in plates coated
with increasing concentrations of
fibronectin. Cells
transfected with RIAM had a 3- to 4-fold increased adhe-
sion compared to controls (Figure 5A). RIAM-induced
adhesion was comparable to that induced by Rap1E63
and was increased by PMA (Figure 5A). Adhesion was
blocked by an antibody against the ␤1 chain of VLA-4
(Figure 5B; Nojima et al., 1990), indicating that, similar
to Rap1-GTP, RIAM induced ␤1 integrin-mediated adhe-
sion. To determine whether RIAM induced active confor-
mational changes in ␤1 integrins, we analyzed activation
epitope exposure in cells transfected with empty vector,
RIAM, or Rap1E63. Cells were incubated with HUTS4
antibody that specifically binds to ␤1 integrins in their
active conformation (Carman and Springer, 2003; Luque
et al., 1996). In basal conditions, RIAM-transfected cells
showed increased binding to HUTS4 to levels compara-
ble to cells transfected with Rap1E63 (Figure 5C).
To examine if RIAM also regulates ␤2 integrin-mediated

(A and D) Jurkat cells stably transfected with
RIAM (closed square), Rap1E63 (closed trian-

triplicate wells coated with the indicated con-
centrations of fibronectin (A) or ICAM-1 (D).
Bound cells are expressed as percentage of
the total seeded cells. Data are means of at
least four independent experiments. (The p

0.000328 and 0.028 for cells untreated and
treated with PMA, respectively. The p values
for RIAM binding to ICAM are 0.00014 and
0.0033 for cells untreated and treated with
PMA, respectively.)

body (B) or on 200 ng/ml ICAM-1 in the pres-
ence (gray bars) or the absence (black bars)

adhesion, RIAM-, Rap1E63-, and vector-transfected Jur-
kat cells were seeded in ICAM-1-coated plates. RIAM-
transfected cells displayed 3- to 4-fold increase of adhe-
sion as compared to controls (Figure 5D). This adhesion
was comparable to that induced by Rap1E63 and was
increased by PMA. Addition of LFA-1 blocking mAb con-
firmed that increased adhesion was mediated by LFA-1
(Figure 5E). As with ␤1 integrins, RIAM exhibited a ten-
dency to promote active conformation of LFA-1 as de-
termined by using KIM127 antibody that specifically
binds to ␤2 integrins in their active conformation (Fig-
ure 5F).
To test whether RIAM-induced adhesion requires Ena/
VASP proteins, we transfected the Jurkat cell line stably
overexpressing RIAM with proline-rich repeats of ActA
to block interaction between Ena/VASP and proteins
containing EVH1 binding motifs (Krause et al., 2000).
RIAM-induced adhesion was unchanged (data not shown),
suggesting that RIAM binding of Ena/VASP proteins is
not required for RIAM-induced adhesion.
RIAM and its homolog Lpd have RA and PH domains

and both interact with Ena/VASP proteins. Therefore, we
compared the adhesive properties of HEK293 cells over-
expressing RIAM or Lpd. RIAM-transfected cells had
increased adhesion on fibronectin to levels comparable
to Rap1E63-transfected cells. Surprisingly, Lpd-trans-
fected cells showed no increase in adhesion but rather
had a small but reproducible decrease in adhesion com-
pared to controls (Figure 5G).

RIAM Knockdown Reverts Rap1-Induced
Cell Adhesion
The ability of RIAM to bind Rap1-GTP, to induce integrin
activation, and to increase adhesion prompted us to
determine whether RIAM is a downstream effector of
Rap1. Rap1E63 Jurkat cell line was stably transfected with
a vector containing specific RIAM shRNA sequences (this
line is named Rap1E63-RIAM-KD) or with shRNA vector
control (this line is named Rap1E63-control-KD). Rap1E63-
RIAM-KD cells had 80% reduction in RIAM protein com-
pared with controls as determined by Western blot (Fig-
ure 6A). Rap1E63-RIAM-KD, Rap1E63-control-KD, and

cubated with GST-RalGDS-RBD followed by
anti-GST antibody to detect localization of
active Rap1 (a and d) and with Phalloidin to
detect F-actin (b and e) and analyzed by con-
focal microscopy. Overlapping images are
shown in (c) and (f). Scale bars equal 20 ␮m.
Control staining showed no detectable bind-
ing (Supplemental Figure S3).

Rap1E63 cell lines were used in adhesion assays. To
determine baseline adhesion, the vector control Jurkat
cell line used in Figure 5 was also included. Compared to
Rap1E63, Rap1E63-RIAM-KD cells displayed reduced
adhesion on fibronectin to levels similar to vector-trans-
fected Jurkat cells (Figure 6B). In contrast, Rap1E63-
control-KD and Rap1E63 cells showed comparable ad-
hesion to fibronectin. Similarly, Rap1E63-RIAM-KD cells
had reduced adhesion to ICAM-1 as compared to
Rap1E63 cells (Figure 6C). Thus, RIAM is required for
Rap1-induced adhesion. This observation places RIAM
downstream of Rap1-GTP.

RIAM Is Required for the Recruitment
of Rap1-GTP to the Plasma Membrane
Rap1-GTP localizes at the plasma membrane, and this
localization is required for Rap1 to mediate cell adhesion
(Bivona et al., 2004). Based on our observation that
Rap1E63-RIAM-KD Jurkat T cells displayed reduced ad-
hesion, we examined whether distribution of Rap1-GTP
was affected by depletion of RIAM. We used GST-
RalGDS-RBD, which interacts with Rap1-GTP (Reed-
quist and Bos, 1998) and has been used to determine

intracellular localization of Rap1-GTP (Bivona et al.,
2004). Rap1E63-RIAM-KD and Rap1E63-control-KD Jur-
kat cells were seeded on anti-CD3-coated slides, fixed,
and probed with GST-RalGDS-RBD. In Rap1E63-con-
trol-KD cells (Figure 6D, panels a–c), Rap1-GTP was
localized in the perinuclear region and at the plasma
membrane (panel a), consistent with previous reports
(Bivona et al., 2004), where it colocalized with F-actin
(panel c). Strikingly, in Rap1E63-RIAM-KD Jurkat cells
(Figure 6D, panels d–f ), Rap1-GTP was displaced from
the plasma membrane and was detected only in the
perinuclear region (panel d). In these cells, no colocaliza-
tion of Rap1-GTP with F-actin was detected (panel f).
These results indicate that RIAM is required for localiza-
tion of Rap1-GTP at the plasma membrane.

RIAM Is Required to Maintain the Cellular
Content of F-Actin
Our studies showed that RIAM-overexpressing cells dis-
play extensive lamellipodia. The physical force for lamel-
lipodia formation is provided by polymerization of actin
underneath the plasma membrane. RIAM interacts with
Profilin and Ena/VASP proteins, important regulators of

actin polymerization. For these reasons, we examined
whether diminished expression of RIAM might affect
the content of polymerized F-actin. We used our vector
control Jurkat cell
line stably transfected with RIAM
shRNA (RIAM-KD) or with control shRNA (control-KD).
In RIAM-KD cells, expression of RIAM was reduced by
80% (Supplemental Figure S4). F-actin content was de-
tected by staining with Phalloidin. Quantification by flow
cytometry showed that RIAM depletion resulted in sig-
nificant reduction in F-actin content, as RIAM-KD cells
had 38.8% ⫾ 9% downshift in the mean fluorescence
intensity of Phalloidin binding compared to control-KD
cells (Figure 7). However, the total actin content was
comparable in RIAM-KD and control-KD cells (data not
shown), suggesting that RIAM regulates the ratio of F-actin:
G-actin content.

Discussion

Rap1 is a small GTPase with a critical role in cell adhe-
sion and spreading (Bos et al., 2001). Recent studies
have shown that TCR, CD98, and CD31 mediate activa-
tion of LFA-1 integrin in T cells, in a Rap1-GTP-depen-
dent manner. We have identified RIAM, an adaptor pro-
tein that may link Rap1-GTP to integrin activation in
T cells. First, RIAM and Rap1 associated upon TCR
ligation in Jurkat T cells. Second, localization of Rap1-
GTP at the plasma membrane that correlates with the
ability of Rap1 to induce integrin-mediated adhesion
(Bivona et al., 2004) was abrogated in RIAM knockdown
cells. Consistently, knocking down RIAM eliminated ad-
hesion mediated by Rap1-GTP. Third, overexpression
of RIAM promoted the active conformation of integrins
and enhanced cell adhesion. Overexpression of RIAM
enhanced adhesion even in the presence of Spa1, a Rap1
GAP that inactivates Rap1, indicating that RIAM func-
tions downstream of Rap1 (data not shown).

Our data showed that in T cells, RIAM and active Rap1
induced a comparable increase in cell adhesion and
RIAM expression is required for Rap1E63-mediated ad-
hesion. Interestingly, in HEK293 cells, in which expres-
sion of either RIAM or Rap1 could induce adhesion, we
detected only minimal expression of RIAM protein. It is
possible that these low levels of RIAM in HEK293 cells
are sufficient to mediate Rap1-induced adhesion. It is
also possible that Rap1 may induce adhesion by mecha-
nisms that do not require RIAM. Consistent with the
latter possibility is our recent observation that Rap1E63-
transfected HEK293 cells have increased number of fo-
cal adhesions but a low change in active conformation
of ␤1 integrins (E.M.L., C.V.C., A.A.F.L.v.P., M.K., A.B.,
and V.A.B., unpublished data). Thus, in certain cell types,
Rap1 may mediate increase in adhesion by regulating
integrin redistribution rather than integrin affinity.
RIAM interacts with Profilin and with Ena/VASP family
proteins, both known to regulate actin dynamics. Since
Ena/VASP proteins also bind Profilin, it is possible that
RIAM may interact with Profilin directly, indirectly through
Ena/VASP, or both. Ena/VASP proteins are involved in
spreading of platelets, macrophage phagocytosis, for-
mation and locomotion of lamellipodia, actin reorganiza-
tion in T cells, and filopodia formation in neuronal growth
cones and Dictyostelium (Coppolino et al., 2001; Han et
al., 2002; Krause et al., 2000; Laurent et al., 1999; Le-
brand et al., 2004; Reinhard et al., 1992). Both RIAM and
Lpd localize at the leading edge and may recruit Ena/
VASP proteins to this site (see accompanying article by
Krause et al. [2004]). Thus, RIAM may regulate the actin
cytoskeleton through recruitment of Profilin and Ena/
VASP. In fact, we have observed that overexpression of
RIAM induces cell spreading and lamellipodia formation,
processes that require actin cytoskeleton reorganiza-
tion. Conversely, RIAM knockdown cells have a lower
content of F-actin, indicating that RIAM together with
its interacting partners Profilin and Ena/VASP proteins
may play a role in actin polymerization. Strikingly, Lpd
also regulates actin polymerization, as Lpd knockdown
cells had a dramatic reduction in F-actin content (accom-
panying article by Krause et al. [2004]).
Ena/VASP proteins directly regulate actin dynamics
(Krause et al., 2003). When all Ena/VASP proteins were
delocalized in Jurkat T cells, the reorganization of the
actin cytoskeleton at the contact site with anti-CD3-
coated latex beads was impaired (Krause et al., 2000).
Fyb/SLAP also associates with Ena/VASP proteins
(Krause et al., 2000). Interestingly, T cells from Fyb/SLAP-
deficient mice do not have detectable differences in the
content of polymerized actin as compared to control
cells (Peterson et al., 2001). Our present results suggest
that RIAM may substitute for Fyb/SLAP, explaining the
absence of a dramatic phenotype in Fyb/SLAP-defi-
cient cells.
Disruption of the interaction between RIAM and Ena/
VASP by expression of ActA repeats had no effect on
the ability of RIAM to mediate adhesion. Therefore, the
effect of RIAM on integrin activation is likely Ena/VASP
independent. Similarly, despite its overall similarity to
RIAM and shared ability to bind Ena/VASP, Lpd overex-
pression could not induce adhesion. Together, these
observations suggest that the ability of RIAM to mediate

RIAM Mediates Rap1-Induced Adhesion
593

Rap1-induced adhesion may be a RIAM-specific, Ena/
VASP-independent attribute.
Recently RAPL, another Rap1 effector, was described.
RAPL binds to Rap1-GTP and modulates LFA-1 distribu-
tion and ligand binding. It has been proposed that RAPL
may interact with ␣L integrin subunit, thereby destabiliz-
ing the formation of ␣L␤2 heterodimer and upregulating
ligand binding affinity (Katagiri et al., 2003). Our present
data showed that RIAM can induce the active conforma-
tion of ␤1 and ␤2 integrins. Further work will be required
to determine how RIAM induces integrin conforma-
tional changes.
We have identified RIAM as a partner of Rap1-GTP.
In the accompanying article, Krause et al. (2004) have
identified Lpd as a binding partner of Ena/VASP pro-
teins. RIAM and Lpd, along with their C. elegans and
the Drosophila orthologs Mig-10 and CG11940, form a
gene family that we named the MRL family. Members
of the MRL family share a common domain structure
with the presence of a RA domain, a PH domain, and
proline-rich motifs. We have shown that the RA domain
of RIAM binds preferentially to Rap1. In the accompa-
nying article, Krause et al. showed that the PH domain
of Lpd is specific for the phosphoinositide PI(3,4)P2. The
PH domain of RIAM is highly related to the PH domain
of Lpd, suggesting that it may have a similar specificity.
Since generation of PI(3,4)P2 is one of the consequences
of TCR ligation, recruitment of RIAM via its PH domain
to the inner membrane leaflet may take place during
T cell activation. TCR ligation induces the recruitment
of Rap1-GTP to the T cell:APC contact site (Katagiri et
al., 2002). At this location, interaction between Rap1-
GTP and RIAM can take place, resulting in integrin acti-
vation and enhanced cell adhesion. Our studies showed
that RIAM has a critical role in regulating membrane
localization of Rap1-GTP, since constitutively Rap1-
GTP was displaced from the plasma membrane in RIAM
knockdown cells. Although the precise mechanism via
which RIAM affects localization of Rap1-GTP remains
to be determined, it is possible that via its interaction
with phosphoinositides, RIAM may stabilize Rap1-GTP
at the plasma membrane. In agreement with this hypoth-
esis, we have observed that RIAM PH domain is required
to mediate RIAM/Rap1 interaction. To our knowledge,
RIAM is the first Rap1-interacting protein shown to con-
tain a PH domain. Thus, RIAM, an effector of Rap1,
controls Rap1 localization at the plasma membrane, me-
diates Rap1-induced adhesion, and has an additional
role in regulating actin dynamics.

Experimental Procedures

Yeast Expression Plasmids and Interaction Trap
pLexA and pJG4-5 (pB42AD) were used as “bait” and “prey” vectors,
respectively. The yeast strain EGY191 (Invitrogen) was transformed
sequentially with the plasmid pLexARap1E63 and a Jurkat cDNA
library in pJG4-5 (Clontech). Interaction trap was done as described
(Golemis et al., 1994; Gyuris et al., 1993). Rap1WT, Rap1V12, Rap1N17,
Rap1E63 cDNA were cloned in-frame with the DBD of LexA. RIAM
deletion mutants amplified by PCR from cDNA clones were inserted
in pJG4-5. The yeast strain EGY191 and the plasmids pLexA,
pLexAc-H-RasV12, and pRFHM-1 (pLexABicoid) pJG4-5-VPR were
kindly provided by Dr. P. Silver (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute).

Isolation of Full-Length RIAM
We isolated full-length clones by ClonCapture cDNA selection kit
(Clontech) using a Jurkat cDNA library and RIAM (nt 540–841) biotin-
ylated PCR fragment as probe.

Northern Blot Analysis
Human Multiple Tissue Northern blots (Clontech) were incubated
30 min at 42⬚C in prehybridization solution (Molecular Research
Center, Inc.) and hybridized overnight at 42⬚C with multiprime ran-
domly labeled [␣-32P]dATP probes (Megaprime Labelkit, Amersham).

Mammalian Expression Plasmids
The ORF of Rap1WT, Rap1E63, and c-H-RasV12 (kindly provided
by Dr. H. Kitayama, University of Tokyo, Japan) were subcloned into
pAXEF-1 (Anumanthan et al., 1998). Myc-tagged RIAM was inserted
in pAXEF or pcDNA1.1 (Invitrogen) vectors. pSR␣HA (kindly provided
by Dr. C. Rudd, DFCI) was used to express RIAM and Profilin as
HA-tagged fusions. Profilin was PCR amplified from pGADProfilin I
(kindly provided by Dr. L. van Aelst, Cold Spring Harbor). To create
plasmid-expressing RIAM shRNA, specific oligonucleotides were
cloned into pLL3.7 vector (Rubinson et al., 2003). As controls, vector
expressing shRNA for mouse Lpd or empty vector were used. The
sequences of the shRNA oligos can be obtained from the authors
upon request.

Antibody Production
RIAM (aa 480–665) was cloned into pGEX-6P1 vector (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech). GST-RIAM fusion protein was immobilized on
glutathione agarose, digested with Prescission protease (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech), and used to raise the polyclonal rabbit antise-
rum #4612 (Covance). Purified antibody was used for RIAM immuno-
precipitation and immunofluorescence. For Western blot, we used
an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed against the RIAM
peptide 78AEQRTIQAQKSLQNQHH96 (Biosource #5541.1).

In Vitro Protein Interaction Assays
PCR fragments from Rap1 WT, Rap1 E63, VASP, and VASP⌬ were
inserted into pGEX vectors (Pharmacia Pharmacia Biotech), ex-
pressed in E. coli DH10B, and purified on glutathione-sepharose
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 10 ␮g of GST and GST fusion pro-
teins were incubated for 1 hr at 4⬚C with 50 ␮l of glutathione-sepha-
rose in GST-buffer (1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mM Tris-Cl [pH
7.5], 200 mM NaCl, and 2 mM MgCl2). 10 ␮l of [35S]methionine-
labeled RIAM or Luciferase synthesized in vitro (TNT T7 System
Promega) were suspended in GST buffer and incubated for 1 hr at
4⬚C with the indicated GST-fusion proteins coupled on glutathione-
sepharose. The samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and
visualized by autoradiography. 1 ␮l of [35S]methionine-labeled prod-
ucts were analyzed along with the pull-down assays as control.

Stable and Transient Transfections and T Cell Activation
COS, HEK293, and Jurkat cells were cultured routinely. Stable trans-
fections were done by electroporation. Transient transfections in
COS cells were done using DEAE-dextran. Stable cell lines express-
ing shRNAs were generated either by electroporation of the linear-
ized plasmids or by infection with lentivirus according to described
protocol (Rubinson et al., 2003). Cells were sorted for GFP expres-
sion. Primary T cells were isolated from leukapheresis products of
healthy volunteer donors using the RosetteSept Antibody cocktail
(Stem Cell Technology). T cells were left untreated or were incubated
with 1 ␮g/ml anti-CD3 mAb and 1 ␮g/ml anti-CD28 mAb (CLB; Re-
search Diagnostics) for 30 min on ice followed by crosslinking with
rabbit-anti-mouse Ig (DAKO; 20 ␮g/ml) for the indicated time pe-
riods.

GST Pull-Down, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot
GST-RalGDS-RBD fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-
sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 50 ␮g of fusion protein
coupled to beads were incubated with Jurkat cell lysates in GST-
buffer. Eluted proteins were immunobloted with Rap1 antibody. For
immunoprecipitations, cell lysates (1 mg) were incubated overnight
at 4⬚C with the indicated antibodies: RIAM polyclonal antibody
#4612, Rap1 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) precoupled to

Sepharose beads (GammaBind Plus); anti-HA (rat mAb, 3F10 aga-
rose matrix, Roche); and Ras (mouse mAb agarose slurry, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were analyzed by immunodetection
with antibodies against RIAM #5541, Rap1 (Santa Cruz), Ras (mAb,
BD/Transduction Laboratories), c-Myc (mAb 9E10, Santa-Cruz), and
HA (mAb 12CA5, Boehringer). Stripping and reblotting of the blots
was done as described (Boussiotis et al., 1997).

Confocal Microscopy
HEK293 cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated coverslips, and
Jurkat cells were settled on poly-L-lysine coated slides. Cells were
fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PHEM (60 mM PIPES, 25
mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 120 mM sucrose [pH 7.3])
and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton-x-100 in TBS. Samples
were incubated with RIAM polyclonal antibody followed by Texas
red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Cy5-Phalloidin or Rhoda-
mine-Phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used for F-actin staining.
For detection of active Rap1, Jurkat cells were settled onto poly-
L-lysine slides coated with OKT3 antibody (10 ␮g/ml), fixed, permeabil-
ized, and incubated with purified GST-RalGDS-RBD or GST followed
by mAb against GST and Cy-5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse mAb
(Jackson Immunolabs). Samples were analyzed by Zeiss LSM 510
confocal microscope. Images were processed for presentation us-
ing Adobe Photoshop.

Cell Adhesion
96-well flat bottom plates (Falcon, BD Biosciences) were coated
with human fibronectin (Sigma) or 2% BSA (Sigma) as negative
control. For ICAM-1 adhesion, plates were incubated with goat-
anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), followed by human
recombinant ICAM-1 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were la-
beled with 0.5 ␮M BCECF (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), washed,
and resuspended in culture media. When indicated, cells where
preincubated 30 min at 37⬚C with media supplemented with 100
ng/ml PMA, anti-VLA-4, or anti-LFA-1 antibodies. Cells were added
to triplicates (HEK293 25,000 c/well; Jurkat 100,000 c/well) and incu-
bated 30 min at 37⬚C. Input was determined using a fluorescence
plate reader (Perspective Biosystem). Unbound cells were removed
by washing three times with warm 0.2% BSA-PBS. Adherence was
calculated as emission of bound cells divided by emission of total
cells seeded per well.

Integrin Activation Epitope Exposure Assays
Cells were incubated with HBS (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.2], 150 mM
NaCl) containing either 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2 or 1 mM MnCl2
and either control (X63), ␤1 expression (TS2/16), LFA-1 expression
(TS2/4), ␤1 activation-dependent (HUTS4), or ␤2 activation-depen-
dent (KIM127) mAbs. Samples were stained with goat anti-mouse-
FITC, washed, resuspended in HBS with 1 mM cations, and analyzed
by flow cytometry. Signals from the activation-dependent antibodies
HUTS4 or KIM127 were expressed as percentage of signals from
activation-independent antibodies TS2/16 and TS2/4, respectively.

Assessment of Cellular Content of F-Actin
Assessment of F-actin content was done as described (Peterson et
al., 2001). Cells were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/cytoperm
buffer (Pharmingen), stained with Rhodamine-Phalloidin, and ana-
lyzed by flow cytometry.
