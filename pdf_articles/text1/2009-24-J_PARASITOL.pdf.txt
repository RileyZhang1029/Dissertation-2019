ABSTRACT: Recent studies in Vietnam and other Asian countries have shown that ﬁsh-borne zoonotic intestinal trematodes (FZT)
occur very frequently in humans. The dominant intestinal FZT in Vietnamese ﬁsh are species of Haplorchis, in particular H.
pumilio. However, basic studies on the biology and pathology of adult H. pumilio are difﬁcult because of the lack of a standardized
experimental animal model. The objective of this study was to establish and optimize such an animal-infection model for H.
pumilio. Using metacercariae isolated from naturally infected ﬁsh, experiments were conducted to identify a suitable experimental
animal host species, as well as the optimum metacercariae infection dose, and to determine the post-infection interval for patency.
In a series of experiments, mice (Mus musculus) and chickens (Gallus gallus dom.) were infected with different numbers of
metacercariae, and worm recoveries were made at varying intervals post-infection (PI). Based on the mean number of adult ﬂukes
recovered/number of metacercariae inoculated and the percent of hosts infected, mice were signiﬁcantly more susceptible to
infection than were chickens. The proportion of metacercariae developing to the adult stage increased with dose size. The peak
worm recovery (geometric mean) was found to be day 7, although not all recovered ﬂukes were gravid until day 9 PI. These
results describe a mouse infection model with good predictability for intestinal ﬂukes, such as H. pumilio, results which could
facilitate investigations on important biological and pathological aspects of intestinal ﬂuke infections.

More than 40 million people are estimated to be infected by
ﬁsh-borne zoonotic trematodes worldwide, most of them in
Southeast Asia (WHO, 2004). Although the ﬁsh-borne liver
ﬂukes (Opisthorchidae) are receiving a deserved increase in at-
tention, the food safety and health impacts of the larger group
of intestinal ﬁsh-borne ﬂukes are only beginning to emerge
(WHO, 1995, 2004; Chai et al., 2005). These ﬂukes, which
include numerous species belonging mainly to the Heterophyi-
dae and Echinostomatidae, are widely spread and often highly
prevalent as multi-species complexes in humans, especially in
south and east Asia and Africa (WHO, 1995; Chai et al., 2005;
Waikagul and Radomyos 2005; Yu and Xu, 2005). Recent in-
vestigations have shown that zoonotic ﬁsh-borne intestinal
trematodes (FZT) are highly endemic in both humans and ﬁsh
in Vietnam (Dung et al., 2007; Thu et al., 2007). Among these,
Haplorchis pumilio appears to be the most common species of
metacercariae in Vietnam (Hop et al., 2007; Thien et al., 2007;
Thu et al., 2007; Chi et al., 2008), although H. taichui and H.
yokogawai are also present, as they are in other regions (Chai
et al., 2005). Their potential importance to public health and
aquaculture poses the need for more information on the biology,
ecology, and epidemiology of these trematodes. For example,
although there are several reports on pathology in humans due
to infection with H. taichui and other heterophyid ﬂukes (Chai
et al., 2005; Sukontason et al., 2005), little is known regarding
the effects of H. pumilio infection in humans, including the
resulting pathology and immunology. Some studies on worm
infectivity, and development in chickens and mice, have been
reported for H. taichui and several other species of Hetero-
phyidae, including Heterophyopsis continua, Stellantchasmus
falcatus, and Centrocestus armatus (Hong et al., 1989, 1990;

Wongsawad et al., 1998; Sukontason et al., 2001; Kumchoo et
al., 2003). However, published information on H. pumilio is too
limited to standardize a protocol for experimental investigations
on host–parasite interactions for this species.
The range of potential hosts that have been experimentally
infected with H. pumilio is broad and includes rats, hamsters,
mice, chickens, pigeons, dogs, cats, and rhesus monkeys (Pear-
son and Ow-Yang, 1982). However, some studies have reported
conﬂicting results with chickens and have involved mice to only
a very limited extent, although these animal species are well
suited for laboratory investigations (Sommerville, 1982; Umad-
evi and Madhavi, 2006). Because of the particular advantages
associated with the use of mice as an experimental host (e.g.,
greater relevance to human biology and greater knowledge
based on host genetics and immunology), it was desirable to
compare these 2 hosts in a systematic manner to determine their
suitability as an experimental infection model and to standard-
ize an infection protocol. A reliable experimental model could
facilitate host–parasite investigations including pathology and
immune responses to infection, parasite longevity, and efﬁcacy
of various treatment methods. A reliable model could also pro-
vide a biological method to identify unknown ﬁsh metacercar-
iae for both diagnostic and research purposes, as well providing
ﬂuke eggs for laboratory snail infections (Chai, 2004).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Recovery of metacercariae from ﬁsh

Two freshwater ﬁsh, the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) and
the silver carp (Hypothalmichthys molitrix), were obtained from house-
hold ponds in northern Vietnam (Nam Dinh Province), where previous
studies have found a high occurrence of H. pumilio in ﬁsh and humans
(Dung et al., 2007). The ﬁsh were placed on ice and transported to the
Research Institute for Aquaculture No. 1, Tu Son, Bac Ninh Province,
Vietnam located about 120 km from the study site. There, the ﬁsh were
kept in cold storage (4 C) until processed for recovery of metacercariae,
usually within 36 hr of collection.
The metacercariae were recovered using the pepsin digestion proce-
dure described in WHO (1995, Annex 6) and as modiﬁed by Thu et al.
(2007). Fish weighing ⬍100 g were digested whole, and ﬁsh weighing
⬎100 g were divided into 5 sub-sections (ﬁsh head, gill, muscles, ﬁn,
and skin and scales; 10 –20 g/section). The ﬁsh samples were minced

by processing in a meat grinder, until paste-like, and subsequently di-
gested in a solution of 1% pepsin and 0.06 M HCl in distilled water at
37 C for 2–3 hr. The digested sample was ﬁltered through a 1 ⫻
1-mm mesh brass sieve, and the sediment was allowed to settle in 0.85%
saline. This washing step was repeated until the supernatant was almost
clear. The supernatant was then carefully discarded and the sediment
transferred into a Petri dish containing 6–7 ml 0.85% saline and ex-
amined under a stereomicroscope. Any metacercariae present were sep-
arated, counted, and identiﬁed by mounting on a glass slide under a
cover slip and viewing with a compound microscope (⫻100) or a dis-
secting stereomicroscope. Metacercariae identiﬁed as H. pumilio (Ya-
maguti, 1971; Velasquez, 1973; Pearson and Ow-Yang 1982; Scholtz
et al., 1991; Kaewkes, 2003) were separated into a Petri dish containing
0.85% saline until they were used for the animal infections, always
within 12 hr of isolation from the ﬁsh.

Animal infections

All animal-experiment protocols followed the animal care guidelines
of the Research Institute in Aquaculture No. 1. and were approved by
the Research Director. Three-week-old out-bred Swiss mice (Mus mus-
culus) were obtained from the Center of Research and Production of
Experimental Animals at the National Institute for Hygiene and Epi-
demiology in Hanoi, Vietnam. Day-old chickens (Gallus gallus dom.,
strain: Tam Hoang) were obtained from the Department of Parasitology
at the National Institute of Veterinary Research, Hanoi. Fecal parasi-
tological examination of the mice, prior to use, revealed infections only
with pinworms (species not determined). The metacercariae were gav-
aged using a 20-gauge feeding tube into animals lightly sedated with
diethyl ether. For recovery of the adult ﬂukes, the animals were killed
either by cervical dislocation (mice) or administration of an overdose
of diethyl ether (chickens). Their small intestine was removed, opened
in 0.85% saline in a glass beaker, and the contents separated by swirling
the intestine. The contents were allowed to settle, and the supernatant
was poured off. This washing step was repeated until the supernatant
was almost clear; it was then poured into a Petri dish containing 0.85%
saline and examined using a stereomicroscope. The adult ﬂukes were
separated and pooled in a Petri dish containing 0.85% saline; the worms
were ﬁxed by pipetting into near-boiling water, then removed after ap-
proximately 10 sec and stored in 5% formalin until stained for identi-
ﬁcation. Adult ﬂukes from each mouse or chicken group were pooled,
and 10 ﬂukes were randomly selected and stained for approximately 15
min in Meyer’s hematoxylin and identiﬁed using the key developed by
Pearson and Ow-Yang (1982). The length and width of the ﬂuke and
its oral and ventral sucker, along with the number and size of eggs
present, were used as a measure of the development stage (age) of the
adult ﬂukes.
Comparisons of mice and chickens for their suitability as an experi-
mental host, and the determination of the effect of metacercariae dosage
on adult worm development, were investigated in Experiment 1, in
which all adult ﬂukes were recovered at day 5 post-infection (PI). Be-
cause mice proved to be a more-suitable experimental host for H. pum-
ilio in Experiment 1, only mice were used in Experiment 2, which was
designed to determine the optimal day PI for recovering the largest
number of adult ﬂukes. Mice were divided into 4 groups of 10 individ-
uals, and each group was intubated with 100 metacercariae. One group
was then necropsied for recovery of adult ﬂukes at 5, 7, 9, and 11 days
PI. One mouse died at day 9 PI, presumably due to trauma suffered by
oral gavage.

Data analysis

Optimal metacercaria dosage size is deﬁned as the number of meta-
cercariae producing both the highest recovery (number) of adult ﬂukes
and the highest percentage of infections in an animal host group. Total
ﬂuke recovery, logarithmically transformed [ln(x ⫹ 1)], was compared
between animal host species and dosage using a 1- or 2-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA). Mean values of log-transformed ﬂuke recovery,
and their 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI), were back-transformed to the
original scale (for convenience, the back-transformed mean value is
referred to as the geometric mean). The number of adult ﬂukes recov-
ered was divided by the actual metacercariae dosage to yield the pro-
portion recovered. For comparison of these proportions, the fate of each
metacercaria (i.e., found as an adult or not recovered) was compared

between the 4 metacercariae dosages or animal host species using Chi-
square values from cross-tabulations. Logistic regression (Hosmer and
Lemeshow 1989) was used to analyze the 2 factors and possible inter-
action between them. Host animals were scored as infected (at least 1
adult ﬂuke recovered) or negative, and the effect of dosage and host
species on infection prevalence was analyzed using logistic regression.
In Experiment 2, prevalence of infection in hosts was compared, over
time, by Chi-square tests. Adult ﬂuke counts (log-transformed) and
measurements of ﬂukes were compared, among days, using a 1-way
ANOVA, and post hoc comparisons were done with the Scheffe test
(Scheffe´ , 1953). P-values ⬍0.05 were used to indicate signiﬁcant dif-
ferences.

RESULTS
Identiﬁcation of adult ﬂukes

Conﬁrmation of metacercarie identiﬁcation was made on
adult worms recovered in Experiment 2. From each day of re-
covery PI, 10 adult ﬂukes were randomly selected for staining
to verify the identiﬁcation of the metacercariae as H. pumilio.
The identiﬁcations were made based on the general morpho-
logical traits typical for H. pumilio, i.e., the presence of a cen-
tral group of 32– 40 sclerites on the ventral sucker in the ventro-
genital complex. Of the 40 randomly selected stained adult
ﬂukes recovered from experimentally infected mice, 33 could
be clearly identiﬁed as H. pumilio. In the remaining 7 ﬂukes,
either the presence of eggs covering the ventro-genital complex,
or the quality of the stained specimens, made it impossible to
make a ﬁrm identiﬁcation. These ﬁndings conﬁrmed that the
metacercariae used for the inoculation experiments were nearly
all, if not completely, H. pumilio.

Optimal experimental host and infection dosage

In Experiment 1, from the number of ﬂukes recovered at day
5 PI, the proportion of metacercariae recovered as adults and
the proportion of animals with infections was higher in mice
than in chickens (P ⬍ 0.001) at all metacercariae dose sizes
(Table I). The proportion of metacercariae recovered as adults
increased with metacercariae dose in mice (P ⬍ 0.001), al-
though this recovery was very similar at dosages of 20 and 30
metacercariae. Recovery differed signiﬁcantly between meta-
cercariae dosages in the chicken, but the trend was less obvious;
the adult worm recovery increased with metacercariae dose in
both host species, but the pattern was different in mice and
chickens, as indicated by a signiﬁcant interaction term (2-way
ANOVA P ⬍ 0.001)

Optimal time interval for worm recovery

In Experiment 2, the proportion of metacercariae recovered as
adult ﬂukes was signiﬁcantly higher at day 7 PI than at days 5,
9, and 11 PI (Table II). At days 7 and 9 PI, all intubated mice
were infected. The developmental stages of the adult ﬂukes re-
covered at these different time intervals are shown in Table III.
The sizes of the ﬂuke lengths and widths, and the ventral and
oral sucker diameters, were signiﬁcantly smaller at day 7 PI as
compared to day 9 PI. As early as day 5 PI, eggs were present
in ﬂukes in 9 of 10 mice and in 7 of 10 chickens at day PI. All
ﬂukes recovered at days 9 PI and 11 PI were gravid.

DISCUSSION

Our results from the experimental infections with H. pumilio
clearly show that mice are superior to chickens in terms of high

recovery of adult worms and their development. Sommerville
(1982) was the ﬁrst to report infection of mice with H. pumilio,
but was unsuccessful in infecting 3- to 7-day-old chickens.
However, as in our investigation, Umadevi and Madhavi (2006)
were able to infect day-old chickens, indicating host age may
be an important factor. Infectivity to 2-wk-old chickens is also
reported for H. taichui, indicating species differences within
species of Haplorchis (Kumchoo et al., 2003).
At a dose of 100 metacercariae, adult worm recovery, as a
proportion of the number of metacercariae inoculated, was max-
imal at day 7 PI and then declined, although gravid worms were
still present at day 11 PI at the end point of the experiment.
Sommerville (1982) recovered gravid ﬂukes from mice begin-
ning at days 3– 4 PI, although only about 40% had eggs; the
longevity of the ﬂukes was not determined. Similarly, longevity
studies on H. pumilio in chickens have not been done; however,
the data from longevity studies in other species of the Haplor-
chinae (Pearson and Ow-Yang, 1982) are of interest. Martin
(1958) reported that Stellantchasmus falcatus persisted in cats
for at least 44 days, and H. taichui lasted up to 48 days in
chickens (Kumchoo et al., 2003). This suggests that the turn-
over of intestinal heterophyid ﬂukes may not be brief and that
their persistence may be dependent on host species and worm
infrapopulation size. The decline in the number of recovered

adult ﬂukes in this study after day 7 PI may be due to the
initiation of immune-mediated expulsion (‘‘self-cure’’), as de-
scribed for H. pumilio by Khalifa et al. (1977), a phenomenon
observed in many intestinal trematode and nematode infections
(Chai et al., 1984; Yu and Mott, 1994; Toledo et al., 2006; Chai,
2007; Maruyama and Nawa, 2007). Alternatively, the large
number of worms occurring at day 7 PI may have compromised
the survival of some of the worms through density-dependent
competition for resources, as has been reported for other intes-
tinal parasites (Keymer, 1982; Smith, 1987; Elkins et al., 1991).
A crowding effect may also be responsible for the higher re-
covery of adults at a metacercariae dose of 40 than at 100 (0.35
compared to 0.17). The reduction in adult worm size we ob-
served at day 7 PI, and the rebound in size apparent at day 9
PI, may reﬂect the impact of one, or both, of these conditions.
Further reﬁnement of this mouse model for intestinal ﬂuke in-
fections should address the longevity of adult ﬂukes and the
impact of infrapopulation intensity, especially on intestinal pa-
thology and the initiation of a possible immune expulsion event.
This aspect is relevant to human infections, in which large var-
iations in intestinal worm burdens are common (Anderson and
May, 1985; Wakelin, 1994).
The mouse model described in this report meets many of the
requirements for laboratory investigations on the basic and clin-
ical aspects of Haplorchis spp. infections and possibly for other
heterophyid trematodes. However, this model can be further im-
proved. For example, other strains of mice, including inbred
strains, should be evaluated for susceptibility, worm develop-
ment and fecundity, and longevity. Depending upon the nature
of the host–parasite interaction of interest, some strains of mice
may be more useful than others, as is often the case with in-
vestigations on host immunity (Chai et al., 1984; Wakelin,
1994). For the investigation of suitable snail hosts, snail infec-
tion, and cercariae emergence dynamics, this host model can
provide the ﬂuke eggs needed for snail infections. Methodolog-
ically, we also recommend (for animal welfare reasons) that
diethyl ether be replaced by isoﬂurane for anaesthesia, which
would be less irritating for the respiratory pathways of the
mouse and have no affect on infection outcome.
