Supplementary Figure 1. Construction of modified MTERF3 BACs. A. A PCR product 

consisting of the 5’ portion of exon 3, the tetracycline resistance gene (Tet-R) and the 3’ 

portion of exon 3 were used to replace the endogenous exon 3 in the BAC thus creating 

BAC-MTERF3Tet-R. Next, Tet-R was replaced by using an oligonucleotide containing 

homology to the part of exon 3 that is adjacent to the 5’ end of Tet-R and homology to the 

part of exon 3 that is adjacent to the 3’ end of Tet-R. This oligonucleotide creates a 

synonymous codon change in exon 3 that abolish a PstI restriction site, thus creating BAC-

MTERF3M. B. Analysis of the expression of BAC-MTERF3M. PCR amplification of an 

MTERF3 cDNA fragment followed by PstI digestion produces a 588 bp fragment 

corresponding the wild-type allele (MTERF3+), a 248 bp fragment of the knockout 

(MTERF3-) allele and a 744 bp fragment of the BAC-MTERF3M allele. The locations of 

PCR primers are indicated by arrows.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Bioinformatics prediction of subcellular protein localization. 

We used the following software tools to predict subcellular localization of human 

MTERF3: MitoProt II 1.0a4 (http://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html), PSORT 

(http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.html) and TargetP 1.1 

(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP-1.1). 

Confocal microscopy 

We analyzed subcellular localization of MTERF3 with confocal microscopy. A XhoI -SacII 

fragment encoding the complete human MTERF3 protein sequence was cloned into the 

XhoI and SacII restriction sites of the EGFP-N3 plasmid (Clontech). The resulting plasmid 

(MTERF3-GFP) encodes a fusion protein consisting of MTERF3 with an in-frame addition 

of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to its carboxy-terminus. We transfected HeLa cells with 

pEGFP-N3, MTERF3-GFP and a control plasmid containing the mitochondrial targeting 

peptide of ornithine transcarbamylase added in frame to the aminoterminus of GFP (OTC-

GFP). We transiently transfected HeLa cells and used a laser scanning confocal microscope 

to monitor expression of GFP. We observed excitation and emission of GFP at 488 nm and 

400-440 nm, respectively. We labelled mitochondria by adding 25 nM MitoTracker Red 

CMXRos (Molecular Probes) to living cells for 20 min and observed excitation at 568 nm 

and emission at 580-640 nm.

Mitochondrial protein import assays 

The full-length human MTERF3 protein was expressed in vitro using the TnT® Coupled 

Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions in the 

presence of 30 µCi of [35S]methionine. Rat liver mitochondria were obtained by differential 

centrifugation and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. 

Mitochondria were washed twice in import buffer (10 mM tris-HCl, 25 mM sucrose, 75 

mM sorbitol, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM KH2PO4, 0.05 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) and 

resuspended in the same buffer at 2 mg protein/ml. For the import reaction, 5 µl of TnT 

reaction were added to 40 µl of mitochondrial suspension supplemented with 1mg/ml 

bovine serum albumin, 2 mM Na succinate, 1 mM methionine and 1 mM ATP, to a final 

volume of 50 µl. In some experiments, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone 

(CCCP) was included in the reaction mixture at 1.7 µg/ml. The import reaction was carried 

out for 30 min at 37oC in a rotary shaker. In some experiments, the import reaction was 

allowed to proceed for additional 10 minutes in the presence of trypsin (10 µg/ml final 

concentration). After completed import, mitochondria were washed twice in import buffer 

and disrupted in 2xSDS sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 

0.2% bromophenol blue, 20% glycerol, 200 mM dithiothreitol) for 3 min at 95oC. The 

mitochondrial lysates were separated in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was fixed, treated 

with Amplify™ (Amersham), washed in 7% acetic acid/ 7% methanol/ 1% glycerol, dried 

and used for autoradiographic detection of labelled proteins.  

Transmission electron microscopy  

12

Electron micrographs of mitochondria were obtained as previously described (Hansson et 

al., 2004). Briefly, small pieces from the left myocardium were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 

0.5% paraformaldehyde, 0.1M sodiumcacodylate, 0.1M sucrose, and 3mM CaCl2 (pH 7.4) 

at room temperature for 30 min, followed by 24h at 4 oC. Specimens were rinsed in a buffer 

containing 0.15M sodiumcacodylate and 3mM CaCl2 (pH 7.4), postfixed in 2% 

osmiumtetroxide, 0.07M sodiumcacodylate, 1.5mM CaCl2 (pH 7.4) at 4 oC for 2h, 

dehydrated in ethanol followed by acetone and embedded in LX-112 (Ladd, Burlington, 

VT). Ultra-thin sections (40-50 nm) from longitude parts were cut and examined in a 

Tecnai 10 transmission electron microscope (Fei, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at 80 kV. 

In vitro transcription. 

As template for in vitro transcription, a linear DNA fragment encompassing nucleotides 

15910 to 728 of human mtDNA was used. Individual reaction mixtures (25 µl) contained 

3.5 µl S-100 extract supplemented with 2.5 pmol TFAM to boost transcription activity. In 

addition, the reactions contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 

100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4U RNAGuard® (Roche), 0.4 mM ATP, 0.15 mM CTP, 

0.15 mM GTP, 0.01 mM UTP, 1.25 µCi [α32P]-UTP, and 85 fmol DNA template. After 

incubation at 32oC for 30 min, the reactions were stopped by adding 200 µl stop buffer (10 

mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mg/ml glycogen). Samples were 

then incubated with 100 µg/ml proteinase K in the presence of 0.5 % SDS at 42oC for 45 

min and the labeled transcripts were precipitated with 0.6 ml ice-cold EtOH. Pellets were 

resuspended in 10 µl loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.025 % 

13

xylene cyanol, 0.025 % bromophenol blue), heated at 95oC for 4 min, kept on ice for 3 min 

and loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide/7M urea gel in 1 x TBE. After electrophoresis, the gels 

were dried and exposed to a Hyperfilm® (Amersham Biosciences) or, for quantification 

purposes, to a Phosphorimager® screen and scanned with a Personal Molecular Imager FX 

(Bio-Rad). Quantification was carried out with Quantity One 4.6 software (Bio-Rad).
