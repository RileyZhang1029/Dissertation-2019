Abstract

The enzymatic activities of threonine pathway in Escherichia coli are sensitive to pollutants such as cadmium, copper and
mercury, which, even at low concentration, can substantially decrease or even block the pathway at several steps. Our aim was
to investigate the complex effects on a metabolic pathway of such general enzyme inhibitors with several sites of action, using
a previously developed computer simulation of the pathway. For this purpose, the inhibition parameters were experimentally
determined and incorporated in the model. The calculation of the ﬂux control coefﬁcient distribution between the ﬁve steps
of the threonine pathway showed that control remains shared between the three ﬁrst steps under most inhibition conditions.
Response coefﬁcient analysis shows that the inhibition of aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase is quantitatively dominant in
most circumstances. To cite this article: C. Chassagnole et al., C. R. Biologies 326 (2003).

1. Introduction

The enzymatic activities of the threonine pathway
in Escherichia coli are sensitive to pollutants such
as cadmium, copper and mercury, which, even at
low concentration, can substantially decrease or even
block the pathway at several steps. Such multiple sites
of action must be taken into account when consider-
ing two important environmental roles of bacteria: in
bioremediation of soils and as commensals of mam-
malian organisms.
The effects that can arise in the interaction between
threonine pathway and general inhibitors that can
have multiple site of interaction such as pollutants
are complex. For this reason, a computer simulation
of the threonine pathway synthesis [1 –3] was used.
This model is based on kinetic functions developed
from measurements on the pathway enzymes under
near-physiological conditions. In order to represent
the effects of the different pollutants on the threonine
pathway, the model was extended with kinetic terms
for the inhibition.
For this purpose, the kinetic parameters describ-
ing these inhibitions have been determined experimen-
tally. In the ﬁrst part of this experimental work, the
more potent inhibitors were chosen by screening. Then
the effects of these compounds on the different steps
of the pathway were measured by titration of the en-
zyme activities.
The threonine pathway in E. coli involves ﬁve steps
from aspartate (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst step is important ow-
ing to its regulation. It is catalysed by three isoen-

zymes: the aspartokinase I (AKI), which is inhib-
ited by threonine, and the synthesis of which is re-
pressed in presence of threonine and isoleucine (an
amino acid synthesized from threonine); aspartokinase
III (AKIII), which is inhibited by lysine (which is also
synthesized from aspartate in E. coli), and the syn-
thesis of which is repressed by lysine; and aspartok-
inase II (AKII), the synthesis of which is repressed
by methionine, an amino-acid synthesized from aspar-
tate in E. coli (for a review, see Cohen [4] and Nei-
dhardt [5]). AKI and AKII are bifunctional enzymes
that also catalyse the homoserine dehydrogenase re-
action (AKI-HDHI and AKII-HDHII). The amount of
aspartokinase II-homoserine dehydrogenase II is low,
so it may be omitted in an initial modelling approach.
The model will allow simulation not only of thre-
onine production as a function of pollutant concentra-
tions but also of the variations of control coefﬁcients
and of the partial response coefﬁcients [6 –10]. We will
show that these parameters are useful for understand-
ing the pollutants’ effects on the whole threonine path-
way.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Cells

An E. coli strain K12 thiaisoleucine-resistant deriv-
ative (Tir-8) [11], de-repressed for the threonine oper-
on [12], was used in the study. Bacteria were grown in
a minimal medium at 37
C with 0.4% (w/v) glucose
as the carbon source. At the end of the exponential
phase, the cells were harvested, washed and frozen at
−80
C in extraction buffer.

Fig. 1. Threonine pathway from threonine in E. coli. The different
steps are catalysed by aspartokinases I, II and III (AKI, AKII and
AKIII), aspartate semi-aldehyde dehydrogenase (ASD), homoserine
dehydrogenase (HDH), homoserine kinase (HK) and threonine syn-
thase (TS). β-aspartyl phosphate (aspp), aspartic β-semialdehyde
(asa), homoserine (hs) and O -phosphohomoserine (hsp) are the in-
termediate metabolites. (cid:1) means retroinhibition.

2.2. Chemicals

The different pollutants tested, KNO3 , KNO2 ,
CuCl2 , CdCl2 , HgCl2 and ZnCl2 , were purchased
from Sigma. The other chemicals were as described
by Chassagnole et al. [1].

2.3. Enzyme assays

The details of this work can be found in a previous
paper [1].

2.4. Initial screening

In order to study the pollutants’ effects, we decided
in the ﬁrst instance to determine the potential inhi-
bitions by all of these compounds through a rough
screening on all the enzymatic activities, at 5 mM or
the highest possible concentration given the solubility
of the compound in the buffer. All the activities were
measured at substrate concentrations around the Km
value and the percentage inhibition calculated relative
to controls.

2.5. KI , IC50 and Hill-coefﬁcient determination

Each enzyme activity was measured as a function
of the concentration of the inhibitory ion. The KI
and the Hill coefﬁcient were determined by ﬁtting the
inhibition curves with a classical Hill equation using
SigmaPlot 2000.

2.6. Threonine pathway model

The threonine pathway model used here is the cul-
mination of a combined experimental and theoretical
study, the details of this work can be found in [1 –3].
In order to reproduce the in vivo the steady state of
the pathway, the measured in vivo concentrations of
the different substrates and effectors and the enzyme
activities have been introduced into the model.

2.7. Incorporation of the effects of heavy metals in
the model

In order to represent the effects of the different
heavy metals on the different steps of the threonine
pathway, a non-competitive inhibition term, with a
Hill coefﬁcient, had been incorporated in each enzy-
matic rate equation (equation (1)).

(Km + S )(1 + (I /KI )n )

2.8. Simulation

(1)

The dynamic modelling of the ﬂux, the interme-
diates metabolites and the ﬂux control coefﬁcient de-
terminations have been done with the SCAMP (Sim-
ulation, Control Analysis, Modelling Package) soft-
ware developed by Sauro and Fell [13 –16]. With this

software, the ﬂux control coefﬁcients and the over-
all ﬂux response coefﬁcient to an inhibitor are deter-
mined by numerical perturbations of the enzyme ac-
tivities or inhibitor concentration respectively and re-
calculation of the corresponding steady state over a
speciﬁed range of inhibitor concentrations. The pro-
gram also allows calculation of enzyme elasticity
with respect to the inhibitors, and partial response
coefﬁcients (the product of an enzyme ’s ﬂux con-
trol coefﬁcient and elasticity with respect to an in-
hibitor) [6] in order to assess the relative contribu-
tion of each enzyme to the total response to the in-
hibitor.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Initial screening

The pollutants tested on the threonine pathway
were nitrate, nitrite, copper, cadmium, mercury and
zinc. The results of the initial screen of each of these
compounds are shown in Table 1.
We can see that neither nitrite nor nitrate inhibits
the activities, except for weak inhibitions of AKI by
nitrate and threonine synthase (TS) by nitrite. Thus
we consider that these compounds will not inhibit
the threonine pathway signiﬁcantly at environmental
concentrations. On the other hand, we can see that
heavy metals inhibit all enzyme activities; moreover
these inhibitions are strong and in some cases total.
We decided to study further three of these compounds:
cadmium, copper and mercury.

3.2. Kinetic characterisation of the inhibition by
heavy metals

Each enzyme activity was measured as a function
of the concentration of the three toxic compounds cad-
mium, copper and mercury, at a constant concentra-
tion of substrate. Figs. 2 and 3 give two examples
of these measurements. All the enzymes were inhib-
ited by these heavy metals, particularly aspartate semi-
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ASD) by cadmium, copper
and mercury, TS by copper, AKI and homoserine ki-
nase (HK) by mercury. Mercury is the most potent
inhibitor of the whole threonine pathway, though the

most sensitive enzyme varies with the metal. The KI s
and the Hill coefﬁcients of these inhibitions were de-
termined by ﬁtting the data according to equation (1)
and are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.

3.3. Simulation of the effects of different pollutants

The mathematical model, already developed for
threonine pathway [3], has been used to simulate
the effects of the different heavy metals (cadmium,

copper and mercury) on threonine pathway ﬂux values
(Fig. 4). We can see that the IC50 for the whole
pathway ﬂux is always larger than the smallest KI for
the individual steps (Table 2) by a factor of two to four.
With the model it was also possible to calculate
the ﬂux control coefﬁcient distribution between the
different steps of the threonine pathway. In the in
vivo steady-state conditions, the control is shared
between the three ﬁrst steps 0.282, 0.249 and 0.466,
respectively for AK, ASD and HDH. The HK and
the TS (respectively 0.005 and 0.000) ﬂux control
coefﬁcients can be considered as negligible [3].
By increasing the cadmium concentration, we ob-
serve (Fig. 5a) a transfer of the control from AK and
HDH to ASD; the control coefﬁcient of ASD reaches a
maximum of 0.9 beyond 2 mM. This can be explained
by the highest cadmium afﬁnity for ASD. The partial
response coefﬁcients (Fig. 6a) emphasize these varia-
tions and show a slight increase in the participation of
HDH.
These variations in control are accompanied by an
increase in β-aspartyl phosphate (aspp) concentration
and a decrease in homoserine (hs) concentrations, due
to ASD inhibition. Then hs concentration increases as
cadmium concentration, which inhibits HK.
The zero-control coefﬁcient of TS explains why its
contribution to ﬂux inhibition (cf. TS partial response
coefﬁcient in Fig. 6a) is close to zero, even in a
cadmium concentration range inhibiting its activity.
By increasing the copper concentration, we also ob-
serve (Fig. 5b) a transfer of the control from AK and
HDH to the ASD, which attains a ﬂux control co-
efﬁcient of nearly 1.0. Thus by increasing the cop-
per concentration, the ASD becomes the only con-
trolling step and the response of the pathway to
copper is accounted for, almost entirely, by the re-
sponse of ASD (Fig. 6b), even though all the en-
zymes exhibit signiﬁcant inhibitions (elasticities) with
respect to copper throughout the range; as a mat-
ter of fact, TS is more inhibited by copper than
ASD, but this inhibition has practically no effect on
the ﬂux. However, it has an effect on the O -phos-
phohomoserine (hsp) concentrations, which ﬁrst in-
creases (Fig. 7b); the subsequent hsp decrease is due
to the ﬂux decrease following ASD inhibition.
When the mercury concentration increases, we
once again observe (Fig. 5c) a transfer of the control
from AK and HDH to the ASD, up to a maximum

of 1 with sigmoid behaviour due to the cooperativity
of mercury inhibition. This dominant role of ASD in
ﬂux response to mercury inhibition is highlighted in
Fig. 6c. As expected, we observe an increase in aspp
and a decrease in all other metabolites.

4. Conclusions

All these results show the value of using model
for understanding the effects of pollutants such as
heavy metals because these compounds could have
multiple targets in a metabolic pathway. Indeed, it is
not possible to predict the global effect on the ﬂux
from the simple consideration of the KI or IC50 values
of the individual steps. As a matter of fact, an enzyme
modulation can only be transmitted to the whole ﬂux
if its control coefﬁcient is appreciable. This is well
illustrated by the TS inhibition, which has no effect
on the ﬂux due to its zero control coefﬁcient.
Because pollutants affect several steps in the path-
way it is also convenient to plot the partial response
coefﬁcients (response of the step scaled by the re-
sponse of the ﬂux), which gives a quantitative mea-
surement of the participation of each step.
