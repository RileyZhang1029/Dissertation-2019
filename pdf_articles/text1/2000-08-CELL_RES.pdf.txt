ABSTRACT

A non-radioisotopic, quantitative TRAP-based telomerase
activity assay was established mainly by using SYBR Green-I
staining instead of radioisotope. Comparing with conventional
radioisotope based method, it was better in reproducibility and
accuracy. Using this method, we found telomerase activities
were absent in normal human liver cells, while detected in all
of four human hepatoma cell lines (BEL-7404, SMMC-7721,
QGY-7903 and HCCM) without significant differences.

Key words:  Telomerase,   non-radioisotopic   telomerase

INTRODUCTION

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that plays a critical role in telomere
maintenance and cellular immortality. Telomerase has been considered as tumor diag-
nostic marker and potential target for cancer therapy[1], [2]. A sensitive, reliable and
quantitative assay is of high interest in this field. The development of a very sensitive
Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) for measuring telomerase activity in
cell extracts has been proved to be an important tool for understanding the role of
telomerase[3]. However, a peculiar artifact was described which in part results from a
staggered annealing between the elongated TS primer and the reverse primer CX[4]. To
eliminate the described artifact, a 6 bp anchor (5 -GCGCGG-3 ) was added to the
5 -end of CX, and it was called ACX[5]. Although a number of improvements to the

original TRAP assay have been done, radioisotope has been used in almost all modified
methods[6]. In the present study, we reported the establishment of a non-radioisotopic
telomerase assay which increased reliability, and allowed the expression of relative levels
and identification of the presence of inhibitors of Taq polymerase at the same time.
Liver cancer was one of the most common malignant abnormalities in China, but
systematic studies on the relationship between telomerase and liver cancer have not been
reported. As the first step of our research, we analyzed the expression levels of telomerase
activity in human normal liver cells and four human hepatoma cell lines (BEL-7404,
SMMC-7721, QGY-7903 and HCCM).

RESULTS AND DISCCUSION

E s t a b l i s hm e n t o f NR m e t h o d

Products of telomerase activity in BEL-7404 human hepatoma cells started at 50 bp and
displayed 6 bp periodicity (Fig 1, Lane 3). Primer dimer PCR artifacts derived from TS
and reverse primer CX used previously were indistingishable from the genuine telomerase

products. However, the primer dimer PCR artifacts, derived from TS and ACX reverse
primers used now without 6 bp periodicity, could be easily distingushed from the telomerase
products. Several control experiments were done as well. The specificity of telomerase
activity detected by NR method was confirmed by the disappearance of specific TRAP
products upon treatment of RNase and heat (Fig 1, Lane 4, 5). Substitution of cell ex-
tracts with lysis buffer also did not result in the synthesis of specific TRAP products (Fig
1, Lane 1).
The R
 quantification standard oligonucleotide exhibited a characteristic pattern

absolute value. TSNT was an internal control PCR template amplified by TS and NT,
giving a 36 bp product. Incorporation of the TRAP internal control was useful in measur-
ing telomerase activity levels in samples that might contain inhibitors of Taq polymerase
(Fig 1, Lane 3). By this means, false negative results could be easily identified by the
disappearance of the internal control band.

As shown in Fig 2, RL method and NR method were about in the same degree of
sensitivity, and telomerase activity in extracts from only as few as 10 SMMC-7721 hu-
man hepatoma cells could be detected by both methods. The results from three repeated
experiments showed that the reproducibility and accuracy of NR method were better
than RL method (Fig 3).
There were no effects on telomerase activity detection while omitting the expensive
T4g32 protein used in NR method. At the same time, the use of SYBR Green-I was cheaper
than [
-32P]-ATP. All of these modifications make the NR method more economical than
RL method. In addition, NR method can get quantitative result in one day by easy handling,
while RL method needs at least two days.

In this survey, telomerase activity of four human hepatoma cell lines (BEL-7404,
SMMC-7721, QGY-7903 and HCCM) and normal liver cells were examined. All four hu-
man hepatoma cell lines showed telomerase activity, whereas human normal liver cells
were apparently telomerase negative. The relative telomerase activities of BEL-7404,
SMMC-7721, QGY-7903 and HCCM were 75.0, 57.5, 51.1 and 77.3 TPG, respectively (Fig
4). This results indicated that telomerase activity was significant in human hepatoma
cells, thus providing a potential approach of selective liver cancer therapy by targeting
telomerase activity.
Several researchers showed that the levels of telomerase activity was correlated with

tumor stage, metastasis and prognosis of cancer, besides as a marker in tumor diagnosis
and a potential target in tumor therapy[1, 2,8,9]. As a result, it is desirable to develop a
sensitive, fast, easy handling, reliable and quantitative method in telomerase detection.
In this report, we have provided a newly established non-radioisotopic quantitative TRAP-
based telomerase assay with obvious advantages. Compared with the radio-labeled method,
its reproducibility and accuracy are better. Moreover it is also apparently more conve-
nient in handling. Using this method, we have demonstrated that the telomerase activi-
ties are expressed in four human liver carcinoma cell lines but not in normal human liver
cells.

RESULTS AND DISCCUSION

E s t a b l i s hm e n t o f NR m e t h o d

Products of telomerase activity in BEL-7404 human hepatoma cells started at 50 bp and
displayed 6 bp periodicity (Fig 1, Lane 3). Primer dimer PCR artifacts derived from TS
and reverse primer CX used previously were indistingishable from the genuine telomerase

products. However, the primer dimer PCR artifacts, derived from TS and ACX reverse
primers used now without 6 bp periodicity, could be easily distingushed from the telomerase
products. Several control experiments were done as well. The specificity of telomerase
activity detected by NR method was confirmed by the disappearance of specific TRAP
products upon treatment of RNase and heat (Fig 1, Lane 4, 5). Substitution of cell ex-
tracts with lysis buffer also did not result in the synthesis of specific TRAP products (Fig
1, Lane 1).
The R
 quantification standard oligonucleotide exhibited a characteristic pattern

absolute value. TSNT was an internal control PCR template amplified by TS and NT,
giving a 36 bp product. Incorporation of the TRAP internal control was useful in measur-
ing telomerase activity levels in samples that might contain inhibitors of Taq polymerase
(Fig 1, Lane 3). By this means, false negative results could be easily identified by the
disappearance of the internal control band.

C om p a r i s on b e tw e en NR m e th od and RL m e th od

As shown in Fig 2, RL method and NR method were about in the same degree of
sensitivity, and telomerase activity in extracts from only as few as 10 SMMC-7721 hu-
man hepatoma cells could be detected by both methods. The results from three repeated
experiments showed that the reproducibility and accuracy of NR method were better
than RL method (Fig 3).
There were no effects on telomerase activity detection while omitting the expensive
T4g32 protein used in NR method. At the same time, the use of SYBR Green-I was cheaper
than [
-32P]-ATP. All of these modifications make the NR method more economical than
RL method. In addition, NR method can get quantitative result in one day by easy handling,
while RL method needs at least two days.

In this survey, telomerase activity of four human hepatoma cell lines (BEL-7404,
SMMC-7721, QGY-7903 and HCCM) and normal liver cells were examined. All four hu-
man hepatoma cell lines showed telomerase activity, whereas human normal liver cells
were apparently telomerase negative. The relative telomerase activities of BEL-7404,
SMMC-7721, QGY-7903 and HCCM were 75.0, 57.5, 51.1 and 77.3 TPG, respectively (Fig
4). This results indicated that telomerase activity was significant in human hepatoma
cells, thus providing a potential approach of selective liver cancer therapy by targeting
telomerase activity.
Several researchers showed that the levels of telomerase activity was correlated with

tumor stage, metastasis and prognosis of cancer, besides as a marker in tumor diagnosis
and a potential target in tumor therapy[1, 2,8,9]. As a result, it is desirable to develop a
sensitive, fast, easy handling, reliable and quantitative method in telomerase detection.
In this report, we have provided a newly established non-radioisotopic quantitative TRAP-
based telomerase assay with obvious advantages. Compared with the radio-labeled method,
its reproducibility and accuracy are better. Moreover it is also apparently more conve-
nient in handling. Using this method, we have demonstrated that the telomerase activi-
ties are expressed in four human liver carcinoma cell lines but not in normal human liver
cells.
