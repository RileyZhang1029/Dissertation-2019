Abstract

To make inferences about the glacial refugia that harboured the limber pine, 
Pinus ﬂexilis
James, we examined the range-wide population structure of mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) with eight size variants in the second intron of 
nad1
. The data consisted of haplo-
types from 704 trees collected from 40 localities. The value of 
F
 for these populations
was 0.80, which is a much larger value than has been reported for allozymes and chloroplast
DNA (cpDNA) in limber pine, and it suggests that the number of seeds moving among
localities per generation is 
 0.12. Gene ﬂow of this magnitude would allow mutation and
subsequent genetic drift to have a substantial impact on the population structure of
mtDNA. The majority of the mtDNA haplotypes are restricted to minor portions of the
geographical range. The data are consistent with mtDNA differentiation in seven glacial
refugia, followed by dispersal out of those refugia.

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to survey mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) variation across the range of limber pine,
Pinus ﬂexilis
, to test whether the pattern of geographical
variation of mtDNA is consistent with the hypothesis of
differentiation in isolated glacial refugia and subsequent
dispersal. This hypothesis was suggested by results of our
previous survey of mtDNA, chloroplast DNA (cpDNA),
randomly ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and allozymes
among seven populations along an elevational transect
in the Front Range of Colorado (Latta & Mitton 1997).
Among-population variation was low for 10 allozyme loci
(mean 
F
 = 0.016) and for one cpDNA marker (
F
 = 0.013),
and all of these estimates were homogeneous. However,
both the mtDNA (
F
 = 0.679) and the RAPD markers
(predominantly, if not exclusively, nuclear) had much
higher levels of population differentiation, and the RAPD
markers gave heterogeneous estimates of 
F
. The major-
ity of the population differentiation was produced by a
single population, which was strikingly different for mtDNA

and RAPD markers, consistent with a zone of secondary
contact. That study (Latta & Mitton 1997 ) tested and rejected
the hypothesis that genetic variation was associated with
an environmental gradient, but the data suggested the
hypothesis that mtDNA and, to a lesser extent, RAPD
markers became differentiated in refugia east of the Rocky
Mountains and in the Great Basin.
Evidence from two sources reveal that limber pine
resided in several, and perhaps in many, refugia when
glaciers displaced the trees from the high mountains. A
glimpse of the ancient distribution of limber pine can be
gained by examining the macrofossils in packrat middens

materials preserved in middens can be identiﬁed and

(Betancourt

led Wells (Wells 1983a; Wells & Stewart 1987 ) to propose
that the limber pines in eastern Colorado (Pawnee Buttes)
and eastern Wyoming (Pine Bluffs) are relicts of the last
glacial maximum, when conifers, including limber pine
and Engelmann spruce, moved off the mountains and
spread into present-day Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
Similar studies revealed that limber pine was found at
numerous sites between 4000 and 8000 feet in elevation
in the Great Basin and on the Colorado Plateau (Wells 1983b;
Betancourt 1990; Thompson 1990). In addition, macrofossils

document the presence of limber pine 22 720 years before
present (
bp
) in the mountains of Colorado (Fremont Co.)
and between 40 000 and 27 000 years 
bp
 in Bighorn Co.,
Wyoming, less than 300 km south of the southernmost
margin of the glacier (Wells & Stewart 1987 ). Thus, it
appears that limber pine may have had at least four glacial
refugia, but it is probable that there were other refugia
that we have not yet identiﬁed.
Genetic markers in the mtDNA of pines are ideal for
detecting ancient events of differentiation and dispersal
(Sinclair 
et al
. 1999). The nuclear, chloroplast and mito-
chondrial components of the genomes of most conifers

have different modes of inheritance, disparate potentials
for gene ﬂow and heterogeneous degrees of population
structure (Mitton 1997 ). For most species in the family
Pinaceae, mtDNA is inherited maternally (Neale 
et al
. 1991;
Marshall & Neale 1992; Dong & Wagner 1994; but see
Wagner 
et al
. 1991; Neale 
et al
. 1989, 1991), and is dispersed
only by the movement of seeds, whereas cpDNA is inher-
ited paternally, and is dispersed ﬁrst by wind-borne pollen
and then by the movement of fertilized seeds (Neale 
et al
.
1986; Strauss 
et al
. 1989; Dong & Wagner 1994). Nuclear
genes, like cpDNA, are dispersed by both pollen and seeds.
In the absence of selection, gene ﬂow is inversely related

to the degree of population differentiation as measured
using 
F
, a standardized measure of the variance of allelic
frequencies. Because wind-borne pine pollen typically
moves much further than pine seeds, the potential for gene
ﬂow is high for cpDNA and nuclear genes, but low for
mtDNA. Empirical studies of conifers are consistent with
these expectations in that the

Here we present a study of the population structure of
mtDNA in limber pine, which was based on 704 trees
sampled from 40 populations. The data suggest that the
mtDNA of limber pine became differentiated in a minimum
of seven glacial refugia.

Materials and methods

Sample sites are listed in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. 1.
The sites include those sampled previously by Latta &
Mitton (1997 ) and additional sites for this study. A total of
704 trees were sampled from 40 sample sites. More detailed
information on the sites is available from the correspond-
ing author (J. B. M.).
Samples consisted of a single twig and a few needles
taken from a mature tree in the ﬁeld. The twigs were kept

facility at the University of Colorado.
Total genomic DNA was extracted from needle tissue
using the hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)
extraction procedure of Doyle & Doyle (1987 ). The primers
of Demesure 
et al
. (1995) were used to amplify the second
intron of 
nad1
 from the mitochondrial genome. The poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) contained, in a 15-

 of each primer and 20 ng of template
DNA. The ampliﬁcation cycle consisted of an initial 3-
min denaturation at 94 
C followed by 45 cycles of: 1 min
denaturation at 94 
C, 1 min annealing and 2.5 min exten-
sion at 72 
C, with a ﬁnal 10-min extension at 72 
C. The
annealing temperatures employed a touchdown temper-
ature proﬁle, with four cycles at each of a descending
series of temperatures (63 
C, 61 
C, 59 
C and 57 
C); the
following 39 cycles used an annealing temperature of
55 
C. The 2.2-kb fragment was digested with 
Rsa
I, and
visualized by silver staining (Klinkicht & Tautz 1992)
after electrophoresis on a 5% denaturing acrylamide gel.
The cleaved fragments of the ampliﬁed DNA were
assigned numbers: 1 was assigned to the smallest frag-
ment and other fragments were labelled sequentially with
increasing size.
Frequencies of mtDNA haplotypes were treated as allelic
frequencies at a single locus for statistical purposes. 
F
 was
used to describe the variation among populations and
was calculated using 
biosys
 (Swofford & Selander 1981).
The homogeneity of haplotype frequencies was tested

Results

Eight size variants of the cleaved fragment of the second
intron of 
nad1
 were detected (Table 1) and we refer to
these as haplotypes 1 to 8. The sizes of the fragments
from haplotypes 1, 3, 6, 7 and 8 formed a regular series;
the sizes of these fragments were 1080, 1120, 1160, 1200
and 1240, respectively. However, the fragments from
haplotypes 2, 4 and 5, which were 
 1100, 1130 and 1150,
respectively, are interspersed in this series, disrupting the
pattern of even spacing.
A row-by-columns test of independence revealed that
the allelic frequencies were heterogeneous among the geo-
graphical areas (
 = 181.1, 
P
 < 0.001). The value of 
F
for the haplotypes was 0.80, indicating that relatively little
of the variation resided within populations, and that most
of the variation was among populations.

Most of the haplotypes were restricted to a small area
of the range of limber pine (Table 1, Fig. 1). Haplotype 1
reached its highest frequencies in the mountains of New
Mexico, where it was the most common haplotype on
Sandia Crest, and was ﬁxed in the Magdalena Mountains.
Haplotype 1 was found only as a rare variant in a few of
the collection sites in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado
and in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah. Haplotype 2
was found only in the two sites in California; it appeared
to be ﬁxed on Mt. Pinos, and was the most common
haplotype at Horseshoe Meadows. Haplotype 3 was the
most widespread; it was distributed from the Sacramento
Mountains of southern New Mexico to the Porcupine
Hills of Alberta, and from Pawnee Buttes in eastern
Colorado to the Wasatch Mountains of Utah. Haplotype
4 was only found at Horseshoe Meadows, California,
where it was less common than haplotype 2. Haplotype
5 was restricted to the southwest. It was ﬁxed at Ouray,
Colorado, and in the San Francisco Peaks, Arizona, and
it was nearly ﬁxed at Wheeler Peak, Nevada. Haplotype
6 was limited to the Wasatch and Uintah Mountains of
Utah , and in those areas it was less common than
haplotype 3. Haplotype 7 was most common at high
elevation sites along the Continental Divide in Colorado,
and it was also found on Black Mountain and La Veta
Pass, which are also relatively high sites. This haplotype
was not detected in Utah, but it appeared again in the
East Humboldt Mountains and as a rare variant on
Wheeler Peak. In general, this haplotype was only
detected at collection sites with elevations exceeding
3000 m. Haplotype 8 was found in just one collection site,
our most northern site, at Whirlpool Point, Alberta,
where it appeared to be ﬁxed.

Discussion

It is probable that the mtDNA variation among extant
populations (Table 1) evolved when glaciers displaced
limber pines, restricting them to refugia that were repro-
ductively isolated by the distances among them. Macro-
fossils from packrat middens and palynological data
provide evidence that limber pine resided in a minimum
of four glacial refugia: east of the Rocky Mountains in
Colorado and Kansas (Wells 1983a; Wells & Stewart 1987 )
and at numerous sites in the Great Basin (Wells 1983b;
Betancourt 1990; Thompson 1990), Fremont Co., Colorado
(Wells & Stewart 1987 ) and Bighorn Co., Wyoming (Wells
& Stewart 1987 ). Furthermore, it is probable that addi-
tional refugia existed that have not yet been discovered.
The distributions of the haplotypes are informative and
suggest areas that may have served as glacial refugia and
the subsequent routes of dispersal out of them (Fig. 2).
For example, haplotype 1 is common in the Magdalena
Mountains and on Sandia Crest in New Mexico, but rare

in Colorado and Utah, suggesting that it emigrated from
a refugium in southern New Mexico and moved with
limited success to the north. Haplotypes 2 and 4, cur-
rently restricted to sites in California, might have become
ﬁxed in a refugium in the southern Sierra Nevada without
ever invading the remainder of the range of limber pine. The
distribution of haplotype 3 suggests that it predominated
either on the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains or
in refugia further east (Wells 1983a), where it is currently
ﬁxed. Haplotype 5 may have become ﬁxed in a refugium
near the San Francisco Peaks of Arizona, then migrated
north to reach Wheeler Peak in Nevada and the San Juan
of Colorado. Haplotype 6 probably became ﬁxed in refugia
in the Great Basin (Betancourt 1990), for it is restricted to
that area. Haplotype 7 may have become ﬁxed in Fremont
County, Colorado, close to its present distribution, which

meanders from La Veta Pass to the western fringe of South
Park and the Continental Divide in central Colorado. Hap-
lotype 8 is ﬁxed in and restricted to our most northern site
in Canada; perhaps this haplotype became ﬁxed in the
refugium in Bighorn County, Wyoming (Wells & Stewart
1987 ), less than 300 km south of the glacier ’s margin when it
reached its maximum. Trees from this refugium probably
spread to the north as the Wisconsin glacier receded.
Dispersal out of the glacial refugia would have been
assisted by Clark’s nutcracker, 
Nucifraga columbiana
,
which harvest and cache the seeds of limber pine (Tomback
& Linhart 1990). Although the birds would have helped
to carry the seeds for expanding populations, their ﬂight
distances are insufﬁcient to maintain gene ﬂow of mtDNA
across today’s fragmented distribution. Flight distances
of a few hundred metres are probably typical, although

ﬂights up to 22 km have been reported (VanderWall &
Balda 1977; Tomback & Linhart 1990). While 22 km is a
substantial distance, this range of dispersal is insufﬁcient
to connect all the extant portions of the range of limber
pine (Fig. 1). For example, we estimate the minimal distance
between populations of limber pine in the Rocky Mountains
of Colorado and the Uintah Mountains of Utah to be
150 km. This gap could be crossed by wind-borne pollen,
but not by Clark’s nutcrackers carrying seeds. Similarly,
limber pine on Mt. Pinos in California and in the
Magdalena Mountains may be exchanging pollen (and
therefore nuclear genes and cpDNA) with pines in other
populations, but the mtDNA in these populations may be
perfectly isolated. Gene ﬂow of nuclear and chloroplast
genes is substantial in limber pine (Latta & Mitton 1997;
Schuster 
et al
. 1989), as it is in most conifers. For example,
when 10 polymorphic allozyme loci were used to survey
population structure for limber pine populations in the
Front Range of Colorado, the mean 
F
 was 0.02, and
inferences of the number of migrants among populations
ranged from ﬁve to 250 (Latta & Mitton 1997). Similarly,
when 23 polymorphic allozyme loci were used to survey
limber pine populations in the Great Basin and Colorado
Plateau, the mean 
F
 was 0.101 (Hamrick 
et al
. 1994),
yielding an estimate of 2.2 for the number of migrants
among populations per generation. In contrast, the 
F
 for
mtDNA for the limber pine populations in the Front
Range was 0.67 (Latta & Mitton 1997 ), yielding an estimate
of migrants per generation of 0.24. The value of 
F
 for
the data in Table 1 is 0.80, from which we infer that the
average number of migrants per generation is 0.12. Thus,
in comparison to the genes moved by pollen (nuclear
genes and cpDNA), the genes moved only by seeds
(mtDNA) have much lower rates of gene ﬂow.
Not only does the limited gene ﬂow of mtDNA prob-
ably account for the substantial geographical structuring,
but it also provides an explanation for the sharp discontinu-
ity in mtDNA haplotypes found in Colorado. The popu-
lations on the fringe of South Park (Black Mountain, Red
Hill Pass) and the populations to the east have predom-
inantly haplotype 3, while all populations to the west of
South Park (Sheep Mountain, Monarch Pass, Independence
Pass, Weston Pass) are ﬁxed or nearly ﬁxed for haplotype
7. For example, most of the limber pine on Sheep Mountain
have haplotype 7, but Red Hill Pass, less than 16 km east
of Sheep Mountain, is ﬁxed for haplotype 3. Thus, the
mtDNA data indicate that there is little or no exchange of
seed between these localities. This abrupt discontinuity
might be an area of secondary contact of limber pines
from genetically differentiated refugia. The limited dis-
persal of seeds would allow mtDNA to record secondary
zones of contact long after gene ﬂow had erased similar
differentiation for nuclear and chloroplast genes.
We cannot determine whether the haplotype diagnostic

for a geographical area is a unique mutation that became
ﬁxed, or is the sole haplotype remaining after lineage
sorting. At one extreme is the hypothesis that the pre-
glaciation limber pines had little or no mtDNA variation,
and that all of the haplotypes detected here arose by new
mutat ions and became ﬁxed in refug ia iso lated by
distance. At the other extreme is the hypothesis that the
preglaciation limber pines had abundant mtDNA vari-
ation, and that lineage sorting ﬁxed different haplotypes
in the various refugia. Understanding the phylogenetic
relationships among the haplotypes might allow us to
reject one of the hypotheses, and to reﬁne the hypotheses
concerning the number of refugia, their locations and
routes of emigration from them. For example, if the haplo-
types present within a region were sister lineages, then
they probably represent 
de novo
 mutation, whereas if they
were more distantly related, lineage sorting is the more appro-
priate explanation. Currently, however, owing to the
extreme conservation of plant mtDNA sequences, we lack
the variable sites needed to estimate phylogenetic
relationships.
Because the haplotypes are identiﬁed solely by size, it
is possible that some of our haplotype designations con-
tain homoplasies; haplotypes identical in size may not be
identical by descent. For example, we found haplotype 7
along the Continental Divide in Colorado and also in the
East Humboldt Mountains of Nevada. Are these haplo-
types identical by descent or are they the product of separate
mutational events? This a problem common to studies of
organellar genomes, for even haplotypes homogeneous
for a particular sequence may be heterogeneous for other
genes in the organellar genome. However, despite the
potential for additional variation within the haplotypes
we have identiﬁed, the strong geographical structuring of
size variants clearly indicates that seed exchange between
glacial refugia has been very limited.

Abstract

To make inferences about the glacial refugia that harboured the limber pine, 
Pinus ﬂexilis
James, we examined the range-wide population structure of mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) with eight size variants in the second intron of 
nad1
. The data consisted of haplo-
types from 704 trees collected from 40 localities. The value of 
F
 for these populations
was 0.80, which is a much larger value than has been reported for allozymes and chloroplast
DNA (cpDNA) in limber pine, and it suggests that the number of seeds moving among
localities per generation is 
 0.12. Gene ﬂow of this magnitude would allow mutation and
subsequent genetic drift to have a substantial impact on the population structure of
mtDNA. The majority of the mtDNA haplotypes are restricted to minor portions of the
geographical range. The data are consistent with mtDNA differentiation in seven glacial
refugia, followed by dispersal out of those refugia.

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to survey mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) variation across the range of limber pine,
Pinus ﬂexilis
, to test whether the pattern of geographical
variation of mtDNA is consistent with the hypothesis of
differentiation in isolated glacial refugia and subsequent
dispersal. This hypothesis was suggested by results of our
previous survey of mtDNA, chloroplast DNA (cpDNA),
randomly ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and allozymes
among seven populations along an elevational transect
in the Front Range of Colorado (Latta & Mitton 1997).
Among-population variation was low for 10 allozyme loci
(mean 
F
 = 0.016) and for one cpDNA marker (
F
 = 0.013),
and all of these estimates were homogeneous. However,
both the mtDNA (
F
 = 0.679) and the RAPD markers
(predominantly, if not exclusively, nuclear) had much
higher levels of population differentiation, and the RAPD
markers gave heterogeneous estimates of 
F
. The major-
ity of the population differentiation was produced by a
single population, which was strikingly different for mtDNA

and RAPD markers, consistent with a zone of secondary
contact. That study (Latta & Mitton 1997 ) tested and rejected
the hypothesis that genetic variation was associated with
an environmental gradient, but the data suggested the
hypothesis that mtDNA and, to a lesser extent, RAPD
markers became differentiated in refugia east of the Rocky
Mountains and in the Great Basin.
Evidence from two sources reveal that limber pine
resided in several, and perhaps in many, refugia when
glaciers displaced the trees from the high mountains. A
glimpse of the ancient distribution of limber pine can be
gained by examining the macrofossils in packrat middens
—
materials preserved in middens can be identiﬁed and
carbon dated to reconstruct plant communities of the past
(Betancourt 
et al
. 1990, 1991). Studies of packrat middens
led Wells (Wells 1983a; Wells & Stewart 1987 ) to propose
that the limber pines in eastern Colorado (Pawnee Buttes)
and eastern Wyoming (Pine Bluffs) are relicts of the last
glacial maximum, when conifers, including limber pine
and Engelmann spruce, moved off the mountains and
spread into present-day Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
Similar studies revealed that limber pine was found at
numerous sites between 4000 and 8000 feet in elevation
in the Great Basin and on the Colorado Plateau (Wells 1983b;
Betancourt 1990; Thompson 1990). In addition, macrofossils

document the presence of limber pine 22 720 years before
present (
bp
) in the mountains of Colorado (Fremont Co.)
and between 40 000 and 27 000 years 
bp
 in Bighorn Co.,
Wyoming, less than 300 km south of the southernmost
margin of the glacier (Wells & Stewart 1987 ). Thus, it
appears that limber pine may have had at least four glacial
refugia, but it is probable that there were other refugia
that we have not yet identiﬁed.
Genetic markers in the mtDNA of pines are ideal for
detecting ancient events of differentiation and dispersal
(Sinclair 
et al
. 1999). The nuclear, chloroplast and mito-
chondrial components of the genomes of most conifers

have different modes of inheritance, disparate potentials
for gene ﬂow and heterogeneous degrees of population
structure (Mitton 1997 ). For most species in the family
Pinaceae, mtDNA is inherited maternally (Neale 
et al
. 1991;
Marshall & Neale 1992; Dong & Wagner 1994; but see
Wagner 
et al
. 1991; Neale 
et al
. 1989, 1991), and is dispersed
only by the movement of seeds, whereas cpDNA is inher-
ited paternally, and is dispersed ﬁrst by wind-borne pollen
and then by the movement of fertilized seeds (Neale 
et al
.
1986; Strauss 
et al
. 1989; Dong & Wagner 1994). Nuclear
genes, like cpDNA, are dispersed by both pollen and seeds.
In the absence of selection, gene ﬂow is inversely related

to the degree of population differentiation as measured
using 
F
, a standardized measure of the variance of allelic
frequencies. Because wind-borne pine pollen typically
moves much further than pine seeds, the potential for gene
ﬂow is high for cpDNA and nuclear genes, but low for
mtDNA. Empirical studies of conifers are consistent with
these expectations in that the 
F
 values of maternally
inherited markers are greater than the 
 values for

Here we present a study of the population structure of
mtDNA in limber pine, which was based on 704 trees
sampled from 40 populations. The data suggest that the
mtDNA of limber pine became differentiated in a minimum
of seven glacial refugia.

Materials and methods

Sample sites are listed in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. 1.
The sites include those sampled previously by Latta &
Mitton (1997 ) and additional sites for this study. A total of
704 trees were sampled from 40 sample sites. More detailed
information on the sites is available from the correspond-
ing author (J. B. M.).
Samples consisted of a single twig and a few needles
taken from a mature tree in the ﬁeld. The twigs were kept

facility at the University of Colorado.
Total genomic DNA was extracted from needle tissue
using the hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)
extraction procedure of Doyle & Doyle (1987 ). The primers
of Demesure 
et al
. (1995) were used to amplify the second
intron of 
nad1
 from the mitochondrial genome. The poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) contained, in a 15-

 of each primer and 20 ng of template
DNA. The ampliﬁcation cycle consisted of an initial 3-
min denaturation at 94 
C followed by 45 cycles of: 1 min
denaturation at 94 
C, 1 min annealing and 2.5 min exten-
sion at 72 
C, with a ﬁnal 10-min extension at 72 
C. The
annealing temperatures employed a touchdown temper-
ature proﬁle, with four cycles at each of a descending
series of temperatures (63 
C, 61 
C, 59 
C and 57 
C); the
following 39 cycles used an annealing temperature of
55 
C. The 2.2-kb fragment was digested with 
Rsa
I, and
visualized by silver staining (Klinkicht & Tautz 1992)
after electrophoresis on a 5% denaturing acrylamide gel.
The cleaved fragments of the ampliﬁed DNA were
assigned numbers: 1 was assigned to the smallest frag-
ment and other fragments were labelled sequentially with
increasing size.
Frequencies of mtDNA haplotypes were treated as allelic
frequencies at a single locus for statistical purposes. 
F
 was
used to describe the variation among populations and
was calculated using 
biosys
 (Swofford & Selander 1981).
The homogeneity of haplotype frequencies was tested
using a row-by-columns test of independence, wh ich

Results

Eight size variants of the cleaved fragment of the second
intron of 
nad1
 were detected (Table 1) and we refer to
these as haplotypes 1 to 8. The sizes of the fragments
from haplotypes 1, 3, 6, 7 and 8 formed a regular series;
the sizes of these fragments were 1080, 1120, 1160, 1200
and 1240, respectively. However, the fragments from
haplotypes 2, 4 and 5, which were 
 1100, 1130 and 1150,
respectively, are interspersed in this series, disrupting the
pattern of even spacing.
A row-by-columns test of independence revealed that
the allelic frequencies were heterogeneous among the geo-
graphical areas (
 = 181.1, 
P
 < 0.001). The value of 
F
for the haplotypes was 0.80, indicating that relatively little
of the variation resided within populations, and that most
of the variation was among populations.

Most of the haplotypes were restricted to a small area
of the range of limber pine (Table 1, Fig. 1). Haplotype 1
reached its highest frequencies in the mountains of New
Mexico, where it was the most common haplotype on
Sandia Crest, and was ﬁxed in the Magdalena Mountains.
Haplotype 1 was found only as a rare variant in a few of
the collection sites in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado
and in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah. Haplotype 2
was found only in the two sites in California; it appeared
to be ﬁxed on Mt. Pinos, and was the most common
haplotype at Horseshoe Meadows. Haplotype 3 was the
most widespread; it was distributed from the Sacramento
Mountains of southern New Mexico to the Porcupine
Hills of Alberta, and from Pawnee Buttes in eastern
Colorado to the Wasatch Mountains of Utah. Haplotype
4 was only found at Horseshoe Meadows, California,
where it was less common than haplotype 2. Haplotype
5 was restricted to the southwest. It was ﬁxed at Ouray,
Colorado, and in the San Francisco Peaks, Arizona, and
it was nearly ﬁxed at Wheeler Peak, Nevada. Haplotype
6 was limited to the Wasatch and Uintah Mountains of
Utah , and in those areas it was less common than
haplotype 3. Haplotype 7 was most common at high
elevation sites along the Continental Divide in Colorado,
and it was also found on Black Mountain and La Veta
Pass, which are also relatively high sites. This haplotype
was not detected in Utah, but it appeared again in the
East Humboldt Mountains and as a rare variant on
Wheeler Peak. In general, this haplotype was only
detected at collection sites with elevations exceeding
3000 m. Haplotype 8 was found in just one collection site,
our most northern site, at Whirlpool Point, Alberta,
where it appeared to be ﬁxed.

Discussion

It is probable that the mtDNA variation among extant
populations (Table 1) evolved when glaciers displaced
limber pines, restricting them to refugia that were repro-
ductively isolated by the distances among them. Macro-
fossils from packrat middens and palynological data
provide evidence that limber pine resided in a minimum
of four glacial refugia: east of the Rocky Mountains in
Colorado and Kansas (Wells 1983a; Wells & Stewart 1987 )
and at numerous sites in the Great Basin (Wells 1983b;
Betancourt 1990; Thompson 1990), Fremont Co., Colorado
(Wells & Stewart 1987 ) and Bighorn Co., Wyoming (Wells
& Stewart 1987 ). Furthermore, it is probable that addi-
tional refugia existed that have not yet been discovered.
The distributions of the haplotypes are informative and
suggest areas that may have served as glacial refugia and
the subsequent routes of dispersal out of them (Fig. 2).
For example, haplotype 1 is common in the Magdalena
Mountains and on Sandia Crest in New Mexico, but rare

a refugium in southern New Mexico and moved with
limited success to the north. Haplotypes 2 and 4, cur-
rently restricted to sites in California, might have become
ﬁxed in a refugium in the southern Sierra Nevada without
ever invading the remainder of the range of limber pine. The
distribution of haplotype 3 suggests that it predominated
either on the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains or
in refugia further east (Wells 1983a), where it is currently
ﬁxed. Haplotype 5 may have become ﬁxed in a refugium
near the San Francisco Peaks of Arizona, then migrated
north to reach Wheeler Peak in Nevada and the San Juan
of Colorado. Haplotype 6 probably became ﬁxed in refugia
in the Great Basin (Betancourt 1990), for it is restricted to
that area. Haplotype 7 may have become ﬁxed in Fremont
County, Colorado, close to its present distribution, which

meanders from La Veta Pass to the western fringe of South
Park and the Continental Divide in central Colorado. Hap-
lotype 8 is ﬁxed in and restricted to our most northern site
in Canada; perhaps this haplotype became ﬁxed in the
refugium in Bighorn County, Wyoming (Wells & Stewart
1987 ), less than 300 km south of the glacier ’s margin when it
reached its maximum. Trees from this refugium probably
spread to the north as the Wisconsin glacier receded.
Dispersal out of the glacial refugia would have been
assisted by Clark’s nutcracker, 
Nucifraga columbiana
,
which harvest and cache the seeds of limber pine (Tomback
& Linhart 1990). Although the birds would have helped
to carry the seeds for expanding populations, their ﬂight
distances are insufﬁcient to maintain gene ﬂow of mtDNA
across today’s fragmented distribution. Flight distances
of a few hundred metres are probably typical, although

ﬂights up to 22 km have been reported (VanderWall &
Balda 1977; Tomback & Linhart 1990). While 22 km is a
substantial distance, this range of dispersal is insufﬁcient
to connect all the extant portions of the range of limber
pine (Fig. 1). For example, we estimate the minimal distance
between populations of limber pine in the Rocky Mountains
of Colorado and the Uintah Mountains of Utah to be
150 km. This gap could be crossed by wind-borne pollen,
but not by Clark’s nutcrackers carrying seeds. Similarly,
limber pine on Mt. Pinos in California and in the
Magdalena Mountains may be exchanging pollen (and
therefore nuclear genes and cpDNA) with pines in other
populations, but the mtDNA in these populations may be
perfectly isolated. Gene ﬂow of nuclear and chloroplast
genes is substantial in limber pine (Latta & Mitton 1997;
Schuster 
et al
. 1989), as it is in most conifers. For example,
when 10 polymorphic allozyme loci were used to survey
population structure for limber pine populations in the
Front Range of Colorado, the mean 
F
 was 0.02, and
inferences of the number of migrants among populations
ranged from ﬁve to 250 (Latta & Mitton 1997). Similarly,
when 23 polymorphic allozyme loci were used to survey
limber pine populations in the Great Basin and Colorado
Plateau, the mean 
F
 was 0.101 (Hamrick 
et al
. 1994),
yielding an estimate of 2.2 for the number of migrants
among populations per generation. In contrast, the 
F
 for
mtDNA for the limber pine populations in the Front
Range was 0.67 (Latta & Mitton 1997 ), yielding an estimate
of migrants per generation of 0.24. The value of 
F
 for
the data in Table 1 is 0.80, from which we infer that the
average number of migrants per generation is 0.12. Thus,
in comparison to the genes moved by pollen (nuclear
genes and cpDNA), the genes moved only by seeds
(mtDNA) have much lower rates of gene ﬂow.
Not only does the limited gene ﬂow of mtDNA prob-
ably account for the substantial geographical structuring,
but it also provides an explanation for the sharp discontinu-
ity in mtDNA haplotypes found in Colorado. The popu-
lations on the fringe of South Park (Black Mountain, Red
Hill Pass) and the populations to the east have predom-
inantly haplotype 3, while all populations to the west of
South Park (Sheep Mountain, Monarch Pass, Independence
Pass, Weston Pass) are ﬁxed or nearly ﬁxed for haplotype
7. For example, most of the limber pine on Sheep Mountain
have haplotype 7, but Red Hill Pass, less than 16 km east
of Sheep Mountain, is ﬁxed for haplotype 3. Thus, the
mtDNA data indicate that there is little or no exchange of
seed between these localities. This abrupt discontinuity
might be an area of secondary contact of limber pines
from genetically differentiated refugia. The limited dis-
persal of seeds would allow mtDNA to record secondary
zones of contact long after gene ﬂow had erased similar
differentiation for nuclear and chloroplast genes.
We cannot determine whether the haplotype diagnostic

for a geographical area is a unique mutation that became
ﬁxed, or is the sole haplotype remaining after lineage
sorting. At one extreme is the hypothesis that the pre-
glaciation limber pines had little or no mtDNA variation,
and that all of the haplotypes detected here arose by new
mutat ions and became ﬁxed in refug ia iso lated by
distance. At the other extreme is the hypothesis that the
preglaciation limber pines had abundant mtDNA vari-
ation, and that lineage sorting ﬁxed different haplotypes
in the various refugia. Understanding the phylogenetic
relationships among the haplotypes might allow us to
reject one of the hypotheses, and to reﬁne the hypotheses
concerning the number of refugia, their locations and
routes of emigration from them. For example, if the haplo-
types present within a region were sister lineages, then
they probably represent 
de novo
 mutation, whereas if they
were more distantly related, lineage sorting is the more appro-
priate explanation. Currently, however, owing to the
extreme conservation of plant mtDNA sequences, we lack
the variable sites needed to estimate phylogenetic
relationships.
Because the haplotypes are identiﬁed solely by size, it
is possible that some of our haplotype designations con-
tain homoplasies; haplotypes identical in size may not be
identical by descent. For example, we found haplotype 7
along the Continental Divide in Colorado and also in the
East Humboldt Mountains of Nevada. Are these haplo-
types identical by descent or are they the product of separate
mutational events? This a problem common to studies of
organellar genomes, for even haplotypes homogeneous
for a particular sequence may be heterogeneous for other
genes in the organellar genome. However, despite the
potential for additional variation within the haplotypes
we have identiﬁed, the strong geographical structuring of
size variants clearly indicates that seed exchange between
glacial refugia has been very limited.
