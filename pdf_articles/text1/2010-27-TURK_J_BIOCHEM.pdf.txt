ABSTRACT
Object ives: Anti ischemic reperfusion effect of crude methanol ext ract of Desmo-
dium gangeticum root had been repor ted earlier but how is modulating its cardio-
tonic effect to render cardio-protection is largely unknown. 
Methods: The inot ropic effect of methanol ext ract of Desmodium gangeticum root 
was investigated on isolated f rog hear t and fur ther analyzed the physiological and 
biochemical effects in isolated rat hear ts. Global ischemia (30min) and reperfusion 
(45min) were modeled in-vit ro condition by using Langendorff perfusion apparatus.
Results: Our results indicate that methanol ext ract of Desmodium gangeticum root 
showed a dose dependent negative inot ropic and ch ronot ropic effect on isolated 
f rog hear t and mimetic acetylcholine like action. In the isolated rat hear t model for 
ischemia reperfusion injury, the results f rom different biochemical and physiologi-
cal effect of Desmodium gangeticum root suggested the cardio-protective nature of 
the herbal ext ract that acts similar to acetylcholine (G protein agonist). Moreover, 
GS/MS result of Desmodium gangeticum root shows the presence of 4 -[2-(dimeth-
ylamino) ethyl] phenol, a G protein agonist and α-asarone, a potent antioxidant. 
Conclusions: The above results suggest that Desmodium gangeticum root ext ract 
mediates the cardio protection in ischemic reperfusion injury model in rat hear t 
th rough negative inot ropic and ch ronot ropic effect by stimulating the G coupled 
receptors similar to the action of acetylcholine.

Introduction

Several endogenous mediators are released dur ing ische-
mic reperfusion that could potentially modulate intracel-
lular signaling by acting on surface membrane receptors 
or on intracellular components of signaling pathways. 
The endogenous protective mechanism against ische-
mic reperfusion mediated by ischemic precondition is 
receptor mediated and initiated by stimulation of several 
Gi protein-coupled receptors including adenosine A1/A3, 
bradykinin B2, and opioid d receptors. [1] On the other 
hand there are some Gi-coupled receptors on myocardial 
cells that are capable of tr igger ing a preconditioned sta-
te, but agonists for them are either simply not released or 
are released in insuff icient quantity to impar t protection 
dur ing preconditioning ischemia. One such receptor is 
the muscar inic M2 receptor. Previous repor t on muscar i-
nic receptor stimulation by acetylcholine predict the re-
duction of myocardial infract size in dog and rabbit mo-
dels of ischemic reperfusion. [2]
The root of Desmodium gangeticum (DG), has been re-
por ted in the ancient Indian medicinal literature with be-
nef icial effects in hear t diseases. [3] In recent times, ex-
per imental studies have shown that the root of DG has 
signif icant protective effects in ischemic hear t disease. 
[4] Moreover, few recent studies from our laborator ies 
suggest the protective nature of DG against ischemic re-
perfusion injury (IR I). [5] However, the exact mecha-
nism of its cardio-protective effects, in respect to the 
present knowledge of the patho-physiology of IR I, is not 
well investigated. The present study was designed to in-
vestigate the cardio tonic effect of methanol extract of 
DG root in isolated frog hear t and to evaluate how inot-
ropic changes can modulates the mitochondr ial and sar-
coplasmic ATPase function in an isolated rat hear t. An 
understanding of the mechanisms involved in these res-
ponses not only informs us of how the hear t reacts to 
injur ious stimuli, but may provide avenues for develo-
ping novel protective strategies applicable in the set ting 
of ischemia-reperfusion.

Methods and materials
Collection of Plant 

The plant, af ter collection from the herbal garden was 
washed, cleaned and maintained in the depar tment. Des-
modium gangeticum (DC) (Leguminosae) was taxono-
mically identif ied by Prof. James Joseph, Head of the 
Depar tment, Depar tment of Botany, Saint Berchman’s 
College, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala. The vo-
ucher specimen A /C no. 3908 was retained in our labo-
ratory for future reference. 

Preparation of methanol extract of roots of 
Desmodium gangeticum

One kilogram (1 kg) of fresh secondary roots of DG were 
sliced and air-dr ied at room temperature. The sliced, air-
dr ied roots of the plant were milled into f ine powder in a 

war r ing commercial blender. The powdered plant mate-
r ial was soaked in 2L methanol for 72 hrs and the extract 
was f iltered and distilled on a water bath. The last traces 
of the solvent were removed under vacuum dr ier and the 
solid brown mass obtained was stored at –4ºC until fur t-
her use. The yield of the extract was 6.1% w/w of powde-
red methanol extract. 
Drug preparations 
i) Methanol extract
1 g por tions of the lyophilized extract was treated with 
0.2 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and then the 
mixture was topped up with 0.8ml of Frog R inger’s so-
lution to give a stock solution of 1g / ml, from which the 
following ser ial dilutions were made: 100mg /ml, 20mg /
ml, 2mg /ml, 1mg /ml, 0.2mg /ml, and 0.02mg /ml.
ii) Acetylcholine
A stock solution of 10mg /ml was made with Frog 
R inger’s solution. The following working concentrati-
ons were prepared from the stock: 1mg /ml and 0.1mg /ml. 
iii) Atropine
A stock solution of 10mg /ml was made with Frog 
R inger’s solution. The following working concentrati-
ons were prepared from the stock: 1mg /ml and 0.1mg /
ml. 0.5 ml of this concentration was added to the bath 
and used as an antagonism of muscar inic receptor.

Chemicals

DL isocitrate and N-Phenyl-P-Phenylenediamine were 
purchased from Acros organics, New Jersy USA. Acetyl-
choline, Atropine, Cy tochrome C & ATP were purcha-
sed from sigma chemical Co., St. Louis, MO USA.  All 
other chemicals used were of analy tical grade.
Animals
Frogs of Rana hexadactyla species maintained in the 
animal house and male Wistar albino rats (150 to 200 g) 
housed in cages and were maintained in controlled tem-
perature at 23±2°C with 12hr. light / dark cycle were 
used for the studies. The animals were fed with food and 
water ad libitum. The animals were maintained as per 
the norms of CPCSEA and the exper iments were cle-
ared by CPCSEA and the local ethics commit tee (Reg 
No. and date 48/SASTRA /IAEC/RDP, dated 16/6/2009). 
Experimental Protocol I
Frog hear t in situ preparation
Frog hear ts were isolated from specimens of Rana hexa-
dactyla [weighing 22.015± 1.2 g (mean ± SE)] and con-
nected to a perfusion apparatus as previously descr ibed 
[6]. Exper iments were done at room temperature (18– 
21°C). The hear ts were perfused with frog-R inger solu-
tion containing NaCl 6.5g, KCl 0.14g, CaCl2 0.12g, and 
NaHCO2 0.2g, NaH2PO4 0.01g, Glucose 2.0g in g. per li-
ter. The force of contraction was recorded and the rate of 
contraction was counted and tabulated.

Experimental protocol II
The rats were divided into three groups, as follows: Gro-
up 1, the control group; group 2, reperfusion; and gro-
up 3, drug. 
Group 1: Normal control
In normal control group, hear ts (n=6) were perfused for 
90 minutes with KH buffer and used for the biochemi-
cal analysis.  
Group 2: Reperfusion
In reperfusion group, af ter the proper stabilization per i-
od, the 30 minutes ischemic hear ts (n=6 in each sub gro-
ups) were subjected to 30 minutes reperfusion (2.1) and 
45 minutes reperfusion (2.2) respectively.  
Group 3: Drug
The animals in the drug group were subdivided into 5 
groups.
Group 3.1: Rats (n=6) in this groups were pretreated 
orally (through ball tipped classic steel 15-16 gauge 
hypodermic needle) with DG at a dose of  100mg /kg b. 
w t. for thir ty days  Hear ts were perfused for 90 minutes 
with KH buffer and used for the biochemical analysis.
In group 3.2 and 3.3, rats (n=6) were pretreated orally 
(through ball tipped classic steel 15-16 gauge hypoder-
mic needle) with DG at a dose of 100mg /kg b. w t. for 
thir ty days. Af ter equilibration and proper stabilization 
per iod, hear ts were subjected to 30 minutes of global 
ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion and 30 
minutes of global ischemia followed by 45 minutes of re-
perfusion respectively.
In group 3.4 and 3.5, a similar procedure was followed 
as above except, instead of DG a standard drug verapa-
mil (0.2 mg /kg b.w t.) was used.

Heart Preparation

Wistar male rats weighing 250-280 g were anestheti-
zed with 40 mg /kg sodium thiopentenone.  Af ter an int-
ravenous injection of 300U hepar in, the hear t was ra-
pidly excised via a mid-sternal thoracotomy and ar res-
ted in the ice cold K rebs-Henseleit buffer (KH) contai-
ning (mM /L) NaCl 118, KCl 4.7, MgSO41.2, KH2PO4 1.2, 
CaCl2 1.8, NaHCO3 25 and C6H12O6 11.  The hear t was 
at tached to a Langendorff apparatus via an aor ta for ret-
rograde perfusion with KH buffer maintained at 37°C 
and pH = 7.4 and saturated with a gas mixture of 95% O2 
5% CO2.  The coronary perfusion pressure was mainta-
ined at 80 mm Hg. the lef t ventr icular pressure develo-
ped with the ventr icle f illed with K rebs solution. The lef t 
ventr icular pressure developed with ventr icle f illed with 
K reb solution was recorded with a pressure transducer, 
which in turn was connected to a device amplif ier and 
char t recorder. This lef t ventr icular pressure gave an in-
dication of the mechanical performance of the hear t. Co-
ronary f low was measured simply by collecting the per-
fusate draining from the hear t in a graduated cylinder 
for a def ined time. The hear t rate was measured by coun-

ting the number of contractions (obtained from the lef t 
ventr icular pressure record) per minute.
Tissue Preparation
The hear t was excised, r insed in ice cold isotonic sali-
ne, blot ted with f ilter paper, weighed, homogenized in 
0.1M Tr is – HCl (pH 7.4) buffer solution. The homoge-
nate was centr ifuged at 300*g for 5 minutes. The super-
natant was used for the estimation of var ious biochemi-
cal parameters.

Biochemical assays

Mitochondr ia and microsomal fractions from the myo-
cardium was isolated by the method of Johnson and 
Lardy [7], and Schenkman and Ciniti [8], respectively. 
Assay of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) [9], malate 
dehydrogenase (MDH) [10], succinate dehydrogenase 
(SDH) [11], a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (a-KGDH) 
[12], NADH dehydrogenase (NADH dH) [13] and 
cy tochrome c oxides [14] were car r ied out in a UV-1601 
Shimadzu spectrophotometer.  Protein concentration 
was measured with Folin phenol reagent, following the 
procedure descr ibed by Lowry.[15] Assay of creatine ki-
nase,[16] lactate dehydrogenase [17] and aspar tate tran-
saminase [18] were also estimated.

GS/MS Analysis

All analysis was conducted with a Perkin Elmer Clarus 
500 GC equipped with mass spectrometry. The chroma-
tographic conditions were as follows: Column: Elite -1 
(100% dimethyl polysiloxane). Helium was used as the 
car r ier gas with a f low rate of 1ml /minute. The 1mL met-
hanol root extract of DG was injected into the GS–MS 
in split less mode at 250°C. The column oven tempera-
ture was held  at 110°C for 2 minutes, then programmed 
at 75°C/min to 200°C for 1 min, 5°C / min to 280°C and 
held for 9 minutes. 

Statistical analysis:

All data were repor ted as mean ± SD.  Results were 
statistically analyzed by a one-way analysis of var i-
ance (ANOVA) by SPSS sof tware 12.00, followed by 
Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT). P< 0.05 was con-
sidered to be signif icant. 

Results
Recording of inotropic and chronotropic ef-
fects

The baseline reading of cardiac f low rate, hear t rate and 
force of contraction were found to be changed with ext-
ract, acetylcholine and atropine (Table 1). The negati-
ve ionotropic and chronotropic effect shown by the ext-
ract followed a dose dependent change (1mg, 4mg, 8mg) 
and the maximum response was produced by 8mg of the 
extract. However, the decreased hear t rate and force of 
contractions were recovered par tially when 50microg-
rams of atropine was administered along with the ext-
ract (Fig 1). Similarly when Ach was treated af ter atropi-
ne, the hear t rate and force of contraction again declined.

compounds (f igure 2). Major compounds compr ises of 
4-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl] phenol -(Cactine) (Reten-
tion time (R.T) 15.41), glycer in, sucrose, asarone (R.T 
18.66), trans –Z- a- bisabolene epoxide (R.T 20.55),

cene dione (R.T 29.10) and Piper ine (R.T 43.56). It rep-
resents around 33%. 

Physiological and biochemical changes in 
myocardial ischemia reperfusion in isolated 
rat heart

Table 2 shows the hemodynamic changes in the rat hear t 
subjected to ischemia and reperfusion. A signif icant fall 
in the mean ar ter ial pressure, hear t rate, coronary f low 
rate, lef t ventr icular developed pressure and rate pres-
sure products were observed in myocardial ischemia re-

perfused myocardium. Administration of DG and vera-
pamil, calcium channel blocker, had improved the he-
matological parameters to a near normal value showing 
cardio protective effect. Similarly mitochondr ial enz-
ymes and microsomal enzymes like ICDH, SDH, MDH, 
aKGDH, NADH dH  cy tochrome c oxidase, Na+K+ AT-
Pase, Ca2+ ATPase and Mg2+ ATPase were observed to 
be depressed in their activity (Table 3 and 4) dur ing isc-
hemia reperfusion. However, supplementation of Tab-
le V shows the level of cardiac marker enzymes in tis-
sue homogenate and perfusate. In ischemia reperfusion 
control rats, increased level of these enzymes in tissue 
homogenate and perfusate indicate sever ity of damage 
to myocardial membrane. However, administration of 
DG before reperfusion preserved cardiac marker enz-
ymes in both tissue homogenate and perfusate.

Discussions

Our results from this study indicates that methanol ext-
ract of DG stimulate cardiac muscar inic receptors the-
reby mediates its protection against ischemia reperfusi-
on injury in rat hear t. The kymogram results (Table 1, 
Fig 1) indicate negative ionotropic and chronotropic ef-
fect of DG extract similar to the response mediated by 
acetylcholine (Ach) in frog hear t. This physiological res-
ponse was reversed by the addition of acetylcholine re-
ceptor /muscar inic receptor antagonist namely atropine, 
suggesting methanol extract of DG mediate its action 
through Ach receptor/ muscar inic receptor, a G protein 
receptor activator. However the concentration required 
by DG (160mg) was more as compared to Ach (500ng) 

to negate the atropine (50mg) action. This difference in 
concentration for DG and Ach may be due to the nature 
its pur ity. In fact, reversion of physiological response of 
atropine by DG extract re-conf irms the muscar inic re-
ceptor mediated action of the herbal extract. In fact our 
GS/MS results reveals the presence of 4-[2-(dimethyla-
mino)ethyl] phenol (Fig 2)  a known G protein coupled 
receptor agonist. [19] Acetylcholine has for long been 
known as a transmit ter that has the proper ty of lower ing 
the blood pressure and also br inging about bradycardia 
through its muscar inic receptor. [20] Impor tantly, supp-
ressed parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) functi-
on has been found in a var iety of cardiovascular dise-
ases, such as hyper tension, hear t failure, and diabetes. 
Cardiac regulation by the PSNS is pr imar ily mediated 
by the M2 muscar inic acetylcholine receptor. [21] Pretre-
atment of the animal with atropine signif icantly reduced 
hypotensive and negative chronotropic activities of the 
extract. On the contrary, some other studies on perfu-
sed hear t have repor ted coronary vasoconstr iction [22] 
and increase myocardial contractility by acetylcholine. 
The positive ionotropic and coronary vaso-constr iction 
effect of ACh on isolated rat hear t are modulated by the 
release of prostaglandins and NO, and both actions are 
muscar inic receptor mediated. [23]
Isolated rat hear t model was used to evaluate the cardio 
protection stimulated by cardiotonic effect of the ext-
ract. Hemodynamic var iables like lef t ventr icular deve-
loped pressure, mean ar ter ial pressure and rate pressu-
re product were depressed in ischemia reperfusion cont-
rol. But administration of DG remarkable recovery of

hemodynamic var iables (Table 2). This result indicate 
a possible similar ity in their mode of action towards the 
physiological response on hear t as observed in frog he-
ar t. 
Table 3 shows the effect of DG root methanol extract on 
mitochondr ial enzymes. Mitochondr ial enzyme (ICDH, 
MDH, SDH, NADH dH, cy tochrome c oxidase) showed 
a signif icant decrease (P<0.05) in their activity. Expe-
r imental evidences suggested that when the myocardi-
um becomes ischemic, the resulting hypoxia prevents 
oxidative phosphorylation, and consequently resulted 
in decreased tissue ATP concentrations and increased 
AMP and phosphate concentrations. However these enz-
ymes recovered their activities by the administration of 
DG. Previous repor t suggested acetylcholine (muscar i-
nic agonist) mediated protective action against infarcti-
on [24] and is dependent on mitochondr ial K(ATP) chan-
nel opening. Signif icantly improved activity of mitoc-
hondr ial enzymes in DG pretreated rat hear t indicates 
the possibility of mitochondr ia mediated action by DG 
root extract. In addition, α-asarone present in the ext-
ract (Fig 2) exhibits character istic antioxidant proper ties, 
[25] as well as acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. 

[26] Even though administration of the standard drug, 
verapamil improves mitochondr ial enzyme function; its 
effect was not as signif icant as DG extract. This may be 
due to the presence of free radical scavenging molecu-
les along with cardio-stimulant biomolecules in DG ext-
ract (Fig 2). 
Physiological dysfunction of rat hear t dur ing ischemic 
reperfusion is predominantly due to the disturbances in 
ionic balance. Microsomal ATPase analyzed in the pre-
sent study (Table 4) showed an improved activities in DG 
extract treated rat hear t as compared to ischemia reper-
fusion control. Trautween and Dudel, [27] were among 
the f irst to suggested that the action of acetylcholine on 
cardiac muscle involves a specif ic increase of membra-
ne permeability of K+. Fur ther, atropine antagonism of 
Ach produced ar rest observed in kymogram result may 
be linked to the inhibition of both Ach induced sodium 
inf lux and K+ out f lux from atr ial tissue. [28] Hence the 
improved Na+K+ ATPase (Table 4) by the DG extract in 
the present study reemphasizes the acetylcholine like ac-
tion by DG extract. Similarly, the improved Ca2+ATPase 
(Table 4) activity and reduced cardiac marker enzymes 
in myocardial perfusate (Table 5) indicates an improved

Ca2+ sensitivity of contractile protein that is essential to 
cardiac contractility. Myocardial injury was assessed by 
estimating the activity of cardiac markers in both hear t 
tissue and perfusate. Higher cardiac marker enzyme ac-
tivity in the tissue perfusate of ischemia reperfused rat 
hear t indicates the myocardial injury. On the other hand 
low activity of the above enzyme in perfusate as well as 
tissue homogenate of rat hear t pretreated with drug pre-
dicts the cardio-protective nature of drug. The decreased 
level of above enzymes in the perfusate and tissue (Tab-
le 5) substantiate the cardio-protection of the extract. 
We conclude from the above observation that DG metha-
nol extract mediates its cardio protection in isolated rat 
hear t dur ing ischemia reperfusion by eliciting the action 
of muscar inic receptor.
