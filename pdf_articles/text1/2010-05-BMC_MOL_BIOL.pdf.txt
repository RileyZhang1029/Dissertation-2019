Identification of endogenous control genes for
normalisation of real-time quantitative PCR data
in colorectal cancer

Abstract

Background: Gene expression analysis has many applications in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic care.
Relative quantification is the most widely adopted approach whereby quantification of gene expression is
normalised relative to an endogenously expressed control (EC) gene. Central to the reliable determination of gene
expression is the choice of control gene. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a panel of candidate EC genes
from which to identify the most stably expressed gene(s) to normalise RQ-PCR data derived from primary
colorectal cancer tissue.
Results: The expression of thirteen candidate EC genes: B2M, HPRT, GAPDH, ACTB, PPIA, HCRT, SLC25A23, DTX3,
APOC4, RTDR1, KRTAP12-3, CHRNB4 and MRPL19 were analysed in a cohort of 64 colorectal tumours and tumour
associated normal specimens. CXCL12, FABP1, MUC2 and PDCD4 genes were chosen as target genes against which
a comparison of the effect of each EC gene on gene expression could be determined. Data analysis using
descriptive statistics, geNorm, NormFinder and qBasePlus indicated significant difference in variances between
candidate EC genes. We determined that two genes were required for optimal normalisation and identified B2M
and PPIA as the most stably expressed and reliable EC genes.
Conclusion: This study identified that the combination of two EC genes (B2M and PPIA) more accurately
normalised RQ-PCR data in colorectal tissue. Although these control genes might not be optimal for use in other
cancer studies, the approach described herein could serve as a template for the identification of valid ECs in other
cancer types.

Background

Co lorecta l cancer (CRC ) is one o f the mos t common
causes of cancer wor ldwide a ffect ing almost a m i l l ion
people annually and resulting in approximately 500,000
deaths [1]. Approximately 5% of individuals born today

l i v e s , r ep r e s en t in g a l i f e t im e r i s k o f 1 in 19 . CRC
remains a serious threat to life with approximately 20%
of patients presenting with late stage metastatic disease.
Although 5 year survival rates are favourable at 80-90%
for ear ly stage d isease , th is drops s ign i f icant ly to less
than 10% with the presence of distal metastasis.

To accurately quantify an mRNA target by RQ-PCR,

quantification of gene expression is based on the analy-

reliable determination of gene expression is the choice
of control gene with which to normalise real-time data
from target genes. Normalisation can be achieved using
endogenous or exogenous controls; however the use of

to re l iab ly measure leve ls o f gene express ion in many
studies in different tissue types including breast [9-11],
lung [12], kidney [13], brain [14] and liver [15].
An id e a l EC g en e (o r g en e s ) shou ld b e s t ab l y
expressed and unaffected by parameters such as disease
status and in the case of CRC, should remain unaffected
by whether a tissue was derived from normal, adenoma
or carcinoma lesions. Traditionally GAPDH (glyceralde-
hyde phosphate dehydrogenase) has been widely used to
normalise RQ-PCR data . A common feature of earlier
studies was that the stability of reference gene expres-
sion between different sample types was assumed with
little consideration paid to validation of these EC genes
a s su i t ab l e no rm a l i s e r s . Mo r e r e c en t s tud i e s h a v e
brought into quest ion the stab il ity o f commonly used
EC genes such as GAPDH on the basis that gene expres-
sion levels have been found to vary in response to treat-
m en t o r a s a re su l t o f ph y s io log ica l , pa tho log ica l o r
experimental changes. For example, alteration in oxygen
tension and hypoxia were found to be associated with
wide variation in GAPDH, B-ACTIN and CYCLOPHILIN
express ion [16 ] . In add i t ion , GAPDH express ion wa s
found to be s trong ly unregu la ted in d iabe t ic pat ien ts
and down-regulated in response to the administration of

bisphosphonate compounds in the treatment of meta-
static breast cancer [17]. Other evidence indicates that
neoplastic growth can affect EC expression levels [18].
Goidin et al [19] found differences in the expression of
GAPDH and B-ACTIN in two sub-populations of mela-
noma ce l ls der ived from a tumour in a s ing le pat ient .
Treatment agents such as dexamethasone, deprenyl and
isatin also affect EC gene expression [20,21]. Schmittgen

the nuclei of HeLa cells [25].

Thus far , a pervasive stably expressed gene (or genes)

This would indicate that the identification of robust ECs

The aim of this study was to evaluate a panel of thir-

most stably expressed gene (or genes) to normalise RQ-
PCR data derived from primary colorectal tumour and
tumour associated normal (TAN) tissue. Six of the can-

represent the most frequently studied reference genes in
cancer including, but not limited to, colorectal cancer.
Each gene was prev ious ly reported as be ing const itu-

GAPDH [29] , ACTB (beta-actin) [30] , PPIA (peptidyl-

selected from an unpublished whole genome microarray
dataset of 20 human tumour specimens and represented
the most stably expressed probes with a fold-change of
1.0-1.2, (p < 0 .05). Expression of CXCL12 [31], FABP1
[32], MUC2 [33] and PDCD4 genes were chosen as tar-
gets against which to measure the effects of candidate
EC expression on the basis of their previously identified
roles in tumourigenesis. In addition to its tumour sup-
pressor properties, PDCD4 [34] also has diagnostic and
prognostic utility and represents a promising target for
anti-cancer therapy.

Range of Expression of Candidate EC Genes
A range of Ct values was observed across the candidate
EC genes in tumour and TAN tissue from CRC patients
as ind icated in tab le 1 . On ly samp les w ith a standard
deviation < 0.3 from the mean Ct of the triplicates were
included for further analysis. The expression of RTDR1,
HCRT , APOC4 and KRTAP12 -3 cou ld no t b e d e t e r -

genes were excluded from further ana lysis . Sign ificant
differences in variance of EC expression were identified
using Leveneâs test (p < 0.001, figure 2B). These findings

The stability of candidate EC genes was analysed using
geNorm [8] and NormFinder [35] programmes. Stability
was further evaluated using qBasePlus [8,36], a commer-
c ia l ly ava i lab le RQ -PCR da ta m in ing package . The se
programmes were used to calculate amplification effi-

determined by each of these programmes is illustrated
in Table 3. In the case of GeNorm the variable V indi-
cat ing the pa irw ise var iat ion (Vn/Vn+1 ) between two
sequential normalisation factors (NFn/NFn+1) indicated
that three EC genes was the optima l number of genes
for accura te norma l isa t ion ( f igure 2 ) , however , target
genes expression did not differ significantly if two rather
than th ree EC gene s we re u sed ( f igu re 3 ) . U se o f a l l
three programmes confirmed that B2M and PPIA was
the best combination of genes for normalising RQ-PCR
data in CRC tissues (table 3). The Equivalence test [37]
was used to examine the express ion of candidate ECs .
All genes were equivalently expressed between the nor-
mal and tumour colorectal tissues using a fold cut-off of

Th e un ch ang ed t a rg e t g en e e xp r e s s ion l e v e l s in th e

sample sizes the biological milieu may diminish subtle
variations in ind ividual samples. In contrast, when the
smaller sample size was used, no significant differences
in target gene expression were observed . Furthermore
the expression levels of PDCD4 appeared slightly higher
in tumours than in normal tissues. When the same sub-

Discussion

Since its introduction in 1996 [38] many methods have
been deve loped for the ana lys is rea l-t ime quant itat ive
PCR data. Relative quantification has come to the fore
as the method o f cho ice due to its super ior f lex ib i l ity
and reduction in inherent variation associated with sam-
ple preparation. Prior to the availability of high-through-
put realt ime PCR instrumentat ion , a handful of genes
were commonly used to normalise real-time data. Major
technological advances enabling high throughput analy-
sis of both samples and target genes have enabled inves-
t iga t ion and va l ida t ion o f pu ta t ive EC genes pr ior to
their use to normalise target gene expression. It is now
accepted that the use of more than one gene to normal-
ise RQ data improves experimental accuracy compared
to the use of a single EC gene [8,35,38]

tion to a s ingle EC gene was inappropriate for human
tissue samples. Moreover, Vandesompele et al identified
errors of up to 6.5 fold when a single EC gene was used
in comparison to the use of multiple genes for data nor-
malisation [8] thereby clearly indicating the potential for

superior accuracy when due consideration is paid to the
choice of EC genes.
Many analytical programmes for relative quantification
have been developed, certain of which enable the identi-
fication of EC genes from a study population [37,40,41].
In the present study the stability of expression of candi-
date EC genes was determ ined using a pair-wise com-
parison model : geNorm [8] and an MS Excel ANOVA
based model, NormFinder [35]. No effect of disease sta-
tus EC gene expression was identified in colorectal tis-
sue. Since both geNorm and NormFinder are based on
the assumpt ion that cand idate genes are not d ifferen-
tially expressed between samples, this was an important
first step prior to their continued use [9,10].
In this study GeNorm was used to identify the most
stably expressed EC genes from our panel of candidates

and also provided a measure of the optimal number of
EC genes . B2M and PPIA were ident if ied as the most
stable pairing. In order to achieve a pair-wise variation
v a lu e (V ) be low th e cu t -o f f o f 0 .15 add i t iona l gen e s
should theoretically be used; however this cut-off point
is not absolute [14] and may not always be achievable
[42]. No significant difference in target gene expression
was observed when the top three most stable EC genes
identified by geNorm were used confirming that using
of a pair of genes may be more practicable given cost,
work load and sample availability considerations.
NormFinder was designed to identify EC genes with
the lowest stab i l ity va lues ; these va lues are ca lcu lated
based on intra- and inter-group variation. In this study
NormFinder was used to define the best combination of
genes using tumour and normal as group identifiers in

of the control genes as calculated by geNorm. Stability value M is based on the average pair-wise variation between all genes. The least stable
gene with highest M value was excluded and M value recalculated till end up with the most stable pair. (B): Determination of optimal
number of control genes for normalisation. The GeNorm programme calculates a normalisation factor (NF) which is used to determine the
optimal number of EC genes required for accurate normalisation. This factor is calculated using the variable V as the pairwise variation (Vn/Vn +
1) between two sequential NFs (NFn and NFn + 1). To meet the recommended cut off V-value which is the point at which it is unnecessary to
include additional genes in a normalisation strategy. The recommended limit for V value is 0.15 but it is not always achievable. In this instance,
the GeNorm output file indicated that the optimal number of genes required for normalisation was three.

Equivalence testing was developed in biostatistics to

For GeNorm, lower stability values (M) indicate greater stability. In the case of NormFinder, stability is calculated from inter- and intra-group variation. By
grouping the tissues into tumour and normal the best combination of genes was identified. For geNorm stability was based on the estimation of pair-wise
variation. QBasePlus through its components, geNorm and qBase, identified coefficient of variation (CV) and stability (M) values and thereby the best
combination of genes for normalisation only when more than one gene is used.

F igure 6 Non -norma l ised cyc le thresho ld (C t ) o f CXCL12 , FABP1 , MUC2 and PDCD4 in co lo recta l t issue . Us ing th is app roach , the
expression of each gene appears to be down-regulated in tumours compared to normal tissues in the large cohort of patients (30 tumour and
34 normal tissue specimens), similar to previous published reports of reduced expression in colorectal tumours. No significant differences were
noted in expression levels of target genes when using the small cohort of patients (10 tumour and 10 normal tissue specimens) (2-sample t-
test). This confirms the effect of sample size on findings when using non-normalised Ct values and therefore the importance of normalisation
especially in such type of studies

c l in ico-patho log ica lly d iverse t issues to systemat ica l ly
evaluate normalisation of gene expression data in color-
ectal tissues. We also conducted equivalence testing to
con f i rm the equa l i ty o f exp re s s ion o f each EC gene .
Thereby , the risks of incorrect rejection (type 1 error)
and of false negativity (type 2 error) were minimised.
As stated above significant differences in target gene

over, significant effect of EC on the magnitude of error
associated with estimation of target gene expression was
a l so de te rm ined in th i s s tudy ( f igu re 6 ) . Ou r re su l t s
were further confirmed by post hoc testing of individual
levels of EC gene expression (Additional files 1). Reduc-
tion in the magnitude of error achieved using the com-
b in a t ion o f PP IA and B2M in comp a r i son to u s ing
individual EC genes alone, further indicates that using
two EC g en e s to no rm a l i s e r e a l - t im e d a t a a ch i e v e s

Conclusions

The findings reported in this study confirm that use of
two EC gene s to norma l ise RQ -PCR da ta resu l ted in
superior accuracy in the quantification of gene expres-
sion in colorectal tissue. The combined use of B2M and
PPIA was validated as the optimal pair of EC genes with
which to estimate the expression of all four target genes
in colorectal cancer tissue. Although these ECs may not
be idea l in other t issue types , the approach descr ibed

herein could serve as a template to identify valid ECs in
other tissue types.

Methods

Tissue Samples
A s tudy g roup o f 64 b iop s ie s o f human co lon t i s sue
samp les was gathered from consent ing pat ients at the
t ime o f pr imary cura t ive surg ica l resect ion at Ga lway
University Hospital , Ireland . The cohort comprised of
30 co lorec ta l tumour spec imens and 34 and tumour-
associated normal (TAN) tissues. Following excision, all
samples were subject to histopathological review prior
immediate snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen and archival
at -80Â°C until further use. Concomitant clinicopathologi-
cal data on pat ients and specimens was obtained from
the Depa r tmen t o f Su rge ry B iobank , NU I Ga lwa y a s
detailed in Table 4. Ethical approval for this study was
granted by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee, Gal-
way University Hospitals.
RNA Extraction and Analysis
Tissue samples (50-100 mg) were homogenised using a
hand-held homogenizer (PolytronÂ® PT1600E, Kinematica
AG , L i t tau-Luzem , Sw i tzer land ) in 1-2 m l o f Q IAzo l

small RNA (< 200 nt) fractions were isolated separately.
For this study, only large RNA was utilised for further
analysis. RNA was eluted in 60 Î¼l volumes and stored at
-80Â°C.
RNA concentration and purity was assessed in dupli-
cate samples using a using a NanoDropâ¢ ND-1000 Spec-
trophotometer (Thermo F isher Sc ient if ic , USA) . RNA
integrity was evaluated using the RNA 6000 Nano Chip
Kit (Series II) and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System
(Ag i len t techno log ies , Pa lo A l to , CA , USA ) . An RNA
integrity number (RIN) was generated for each sample
u s in g t h e Ag i l en t 2 1 00 E xp e r t S o f tw a r e (V e r s ion
B.02.03) based on the ratio of ribosomal bands and also
the presence or absence of degradation products on the
electrophoretic and gel-like images. A threshold value of
RIN â¥ 7 was applied and RNA purity was verified by an
average A260/A280 ratio of 1 .98 (range 1.97-2.01) and
A260/A230 ration of 1.7 (range 1.5-1.83).
Candidate Endogenous Control Genes
Based on literature search six commonly used candidate
endogenous con tro l genes were se lec ted for ana ly s is :
ACTB , GAPDH , HPRT , B2M , PPIA and MRPL19 . An
add i t ion a l p an e l o f se v en g en e s : HCRT , SLC 2 5A 23 ,
DTX3, APOC4, RTDR1, KRTAP12-3 and CHRNB4, was
also selected for analysis (Table 2) . To our knowledge
all genes have independent cellular functions and were
assumed not to be co-regulated.
cDNA Synthesis and RQ-PCR
First strand cDNA was synthesised using Superscriptâ¢
III reverse transcr iptase (Inv itrogen L ife techno log ies ,
Paisley, UK) and random primers (N9; 1 Î¼g, MWG Bio-
tech, AG, Ebersberg, Germany). Negative control sam-
p les were inc luded in each set o f react ions . React ions
were incubated at 25Â°C for 5 minutes followed by 50Â°C
fo r 1 hou r and f in a l d en a tu r a t ion a t 7 2 Â°C fo r 1 5

minutes. Samples were subsequently diluted to 50 Î¼L in
nuclease-free water and stored at -20Â°C. The expression
of each EC gene was analysed by RQ-PCR using Taq-
Man Â® gene expres s ion as says us ing a 7900HT ins tru-
m en t (App l i ed B io s y s t em s , Fo s t e r c i t y , USA ) . A l l
reactions were performed in 20 Î¼L reactions, in tripli-
cate within the same PCR run. Negative controls were
in c lud ed fo r e a ch g en e t a rg e t und e r a s s a y . On e a ch
plate, an interassay control was included to account for
an y v a r i a t ion s b e tw e en run s . Fo r e a ch w e l l 2 Î¼ l o f
cDNA f rom each samp le wa s added to 18 Î¼ l o f PCR
reaction mix which consisted of 10Ã TaqManÂ® universal
master mix, No AmpErase UNG, 7Ã nuclease free water
and 1Ã g en e e xp r e s s i on a s s a y p r im e r -p r ob e m i x
(Applied Biosystems, Foster city, USA). The PCR reac-
tions were initiated with a 10 minute incubation at 95Â°C
followed by 40 cycles of 95Â°C for 15 seconds and 60Â°C
for 60 seconds , in accordance with the manufacturer âs
recommendations.
PCR Amplification Efficiency
Amplification efficiencies for each EC gene assay were
calculated applying the formula E = (10-1/slope - 1) Ã
100, using the slope of the plot of Ct versus log input of
cDNA (10 - fo ld d i lu t ion s e r i e s ) . A th r e sho ld o f 10%
abo v e and b e low 10 0% e f f i c i en c y w a s app l i ed . PCR
amp l if icat ion eff ic iency for each cand idate EC gene is
shown in table 2.
Data Analysis
Cycle threshold (Ct) is defined as the PCR cycle number
at which the fluorescence generated from amplification
of the target gene within a sample increases to a thresh-
old value of 10 times the standard deviation of the base
line emission and is inversely proportionate to the start-
ing amount of the target cDNA. QBasePlus was used for
calculation of PDCD4 expression relative to each of the

between tumour and normal tissues. One-way ANOVA,
two-sample t-test, Leveneâs test and Spearman and Pear-
son correlations were used to determine association and
comparisons between groups. P values < 0.05 were con-
sidered statistically significant.
