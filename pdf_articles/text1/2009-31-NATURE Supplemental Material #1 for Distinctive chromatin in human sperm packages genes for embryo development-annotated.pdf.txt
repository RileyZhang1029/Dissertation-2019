Supplemental Fig. 1: Composition of human sperm chromatin. a, Quantifying histone 
content of primary fibroblast or human sperm cells by immunoblot analysis with the H3C 
terminus antibody. b, Sequential digestion of sperm chromatin with increasing 
concentrations of micrococal nuclease (MNase) releases mononucleosomes (lanes 1 and 
2), whereas protamine-packaged chromatin resists MNase (lane 6). c, Characterizing the 
mononucleosome fraction released into the MNase supernatant pool from panel b. d, Gel-
purified mononucleosomal DNA used for array hybridization or sequencing. e,
Quantification of the amount of histone released by MNase treatment.  Supernatants were 
pooled. Here, cell equivalents were loaded in each lane; 4% of the total supernatant or 
protamine pellet. The gel was subjected to immunoblotting and quantified on a Typhoon 
(Amersham). f, Western analysis, involving titrations for bulk levels of H3K4me3, 
H3K4me2, H3K27me3 in primary fibroblast cells and mature sperm cells.  Quanitation 
by Typhoon (Amersham) reveals that sperm bear ~4% of the histone H3 present in a 
primary fibroblast. 

Supplemental Fig. 2: Schematic representation of experimental procedures. Two fertile 
donors were used for methylation studies, one donor (D1) was used for all histone 
modifications studied on the arrays. A pool of fertile donors were utilized for 
mononucleosome localization and characterization and to extend the analysis genome-
wide using Illumina GAII.

sequencing) and the x-axis is the annotated physical map (HG18).  a, The HOXA locus.

Supplemental Fig. 4: Certain self-renewal genes as well as genes required for embryonic 
development generally lack DNA methylation and are bivalent. a, SOX2 and FOXD3 are 
member of the pluripotency netwok. SOX2 is demethylated and characterized by the 
presence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, whereas FOXD3 is hypermethylated near their 
transcription start sites. OCT4 and NANOG are also hypermethylated (Supplementary 
Fig. 10c). b, Genes involved in embryonic development are typically DNA 
hypomethylated, and have high levels of H3K4me2/3  and H3K27me3 around their start 
sites The red asterisks indicate the region amplified for bisulfite sequencing in 
Supplementary Fig. 10. The y-axis is the signal intensity (log2 for ChIP-chip arrays, or

Supplemental Fig 7: qPCR testing of epigenetically modified loci enriched by Illumina 
GAII sequencing and/or array analysis. a, qPCR testing of histone occupancy at both 
maternally and paternally imprinted genes (KCNQ1, IGF2, MEST, and IG-DMR), 
miRNAs and noncoding RNA (miR-196, miR-9.2, miR-153-1, miR-17, and HOTAIR),
and at a subset of developmental genes. Negative controls (NCs) (PRKACB and ZP4) are 
regions that had very low levels of histone by Illumina GAII sequencing and/or array 
data. Fold enrichment of histone at these promoters was determined by MNase signal 
divided by the total genomic DNA signal b, Fold enrichment of H3K4me3 was 
determined by normalizing signal from the H3K4me3 IP eluate to the signal from MNase 
(histone pool). Two maternally-imprinted loci in sperm were used as negative controls. c,
H3K27me3 and d, H3K9me3 enrichment were determined as described above. H3K9me3 
positive controls (PCs) were two pericentromeric heterochromatin loci. e, qPCR testing 
of MeDIP data. Enriched loci from MeDIP arrays were binned into the top 100 regions or 
400 enriched regions. qPCR of MeDIP eluates were performed for the bottom 10 regions 
in each of the top 100 and 400 bins. Since all 20 regions enriched for DNA methylation, a 
cutoff of the top 400 genes (approximately 2-fold) was our stringent cutoff for DNA 
methylation.  qPCR fold enrichment was compared to input (total sheared genomic 
DNA). Positive controls were two known methylated (imprinted) regions and negative 
controls were regions that are demethylated in sperm when compared to fibroblast.

Supplemental Fig 8: H2A.Z localizes to pericentric heterochromatin in the mature 
human sperm. Brown bars are the normalized difference scores for pooled donor H2A.Z 
across chromosome 16, and in orange is the FDR.  Other chromosomes showed similar 
peaks flanking the centromere. Pericentric heterochromatin was highly enriched with 
H2A.Z (FDR <0.05). 

Supplemental Fig 9: Genes required for sperm development generally lack DNA 
methylation and are bound by H3K4me3. a, Four genes expressed at different stages of 
spermatogenesis remain DNA demethylated and retain H3K4me3 enrichment. b, Gene 
promoters involved in RNA processing, a process utilized intensely during 
spermiogenesis, are also demethylated and H3K4me3 bound.

of the AIR transcript localizes with H3K4me3, whereas promoters silenced by AIR
(SLCs) lack H3K4me3 c, Similarly, the GNASAS is paternally expressed and has 
H3K4me3, whereas the remaining promoters are maternally expressed and lack 
H3K4me3. 

Supplemental Fig 12: H3K4me2/3 chromatin modifications are correlated with early 
embryonic genes expression at the 4 and 8 cell stage. a, A subset of genes enriched at the 
4 cell stage have significant levels of H3K4me3 b, whereas genes enriched at the 8-cell 
stage were associated with high levels of H3K4me2. Fold enrichment for H3K4me3/2 
was determined by signal from IP eluate divided the signal derived from the pooled 
mononucleosomes.
