Supplementary Figure 1  Gene expression and vector DNA in testis 

after i.v. administration of AAV1, AAV6 and AAV8 in adult mice.  

10 -week-old mice were injected via the tail vein with 1 × 10 12 v.g. of 

dsAAV-CB -GFP vectors, and sacrificed at 2 weeks post vector injection. 

(a) Fluorescent microscopy (20 seconds exposure) of cryosections and 

anti-GFP immuno -fuorescence (IF) staining showed that the GFP 

expressions only existed in interstitial tissues, but not in spermatocytes of 

seminiferous tubules. In immuno -staining, the same section was 

counter-stained with DAPI (label the nuclei) to show the detailed 

histological structure. Control is the testis of untreated mouse.  (b) 

Quantitative analysis of vector DNA in testis. The data was from 3 mice 

and presented a s mean ± s.e . Scale bar, 100 µm.
