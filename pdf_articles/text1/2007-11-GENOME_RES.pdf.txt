It is now well known that bone mineral density (BMD) variance is determined by both genetic and environmental
factors. Accordingly, studies in human and animal models have revealed evidence for the presence of several
quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to BMD variations. However, the identification of BMD QTL genes
remains a big challenge.
In the current study, we focused our efforts to identify the BMD candidate gene in
chromosome 1 (Chr 1) QTL that was detected from a cross involving high BMD CAST/EiJ (CAST) and low BMD
C57BL/6J (B6) mice. To this end, we have combined several approaches including: (1) fine mapping the BMD QTL in
Chr 1 of the B6.CAST F2 female mice using a large number of polymorphic markers; (2) the generation of congenic
sublines of mice by repeated backcrossing of CAST with B6 mice and phenotype characterization; (3) expression
profiling genes in the QTL region; and (4) SNP analyses to identify the mouse Duffy Antigen Receptor for
Chemokines (Darc) as a candidate gene for Chr 1 BMD QTL2. We verified the involvement of the Darc protein in BMD
variation by evaluating the skeletal phenotype of Darc-knockout mice and congenic sublines of mice carrying small
chromosomal segments from CAST BMD QTL. Based on the findings that Darc-antibody blocked formation of
multinucleated osteoclasts in vitro and that Darc from CAST binds chemokines, known to regulate osteoclast
formation, with reduced affinity compared with Darc from B6 mice, we conclude that Darc regulates BMD negatively
by increasing osteoclast formation, and that the genetic association between Darc gene polymorphism and BMD
variations in humans merits investigation.

Osteoporosis is a condition associated with decreased bone
strength and an increased fracture risk. Its prevalence is increas-
ing as more individuals with low bone mineral density (BMD),
the strongest predictor of fracture risk, are detected. Thus, mo-
lecular dissection of the BMD regulatory system may reveal novel
therapeutic targets for the treatment of osteoporosis. Several
studies preformed on both humans and mice have shown that
BMD has a strong heritable component, with estimates that
genes account for 60%–80% of BMD variance (Morrison et al.
1994; Beamer et al. 1996; Devoto et al. 1998; Klein et al. 1998;
Eisman 1999; Niu et al. 1999; Baldock and Eisman 2004). Accord-
ingly, linkage studies in humans and experimental animal mod-
els have identified several BMD QTLs. However, the big challenge
has been identifying the “QTL gene.” To our knowledge, only a
single QTL gene, Alox15, has been identified thus far as a BMD
QTL gene (Klein et al. 2004).
To screen for BMD candidate genes, we have chosen to dis-
sect the BMD QTL in chromosome 1, because this QTL has been
identified in four different intercrosses: C57BL/6J (B6) ⳯ Cast/EiJ
(CAST) (Beamer et al. 1999), B6 ⳯ C3H/HeJ (Beamer et al. 2001),
B6 ⳯ DBA/2 (Klein et al. 1998), and MRL/MpJ ⳯ SJL/J (Masinde
et al. 2002). Furthermore, a syntenic region in human chromo-
some 1q21-q43 carries a previously identified BMD QTL, which
has been reported in independent studies using human popula-

tions (Koller et al. 2000; Ralston 2002). In this report, we present
data on the identification of Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemo-
kines (Darc) as a BMD QTL gene by utilizing a variety of molecu-
lar genetic approaches.

Results

Fine mapping and congenic sublines of mice

In a recently published study (Edderkaoui et al. 2006), we re-
ported the identification of three BMD loci at Chr 1 by superim-
posing the CAST chromosomal regions carried by each congenic
subline. The Bmd1a locus was located between D1mit133 and
D1mit453 (133.2–165.2 Mb), the Bmd1b locus was located be-
tween D1mit113 and D1mit150 (171.86–174.76 Mb), and a
Bmd1c, which regulates BMD negatively, was located between
D1mit221 and D1mit511 (184.86–192.06 Mb). In this study, we
further fine mapped the Chr 1 QTL region by genotyping 565
B6.CAST F2 female mice with a large number of polymorphic
markers from this region. Interval mapping using MapQTL 4.0 to
identify the linkage between polymorphic markers and femur
total volumetric BMD (vBMD) within the F2 female mice showed
three peaks/QTL: peak 1 at marker D1mit453 (Bmd1a, at 165.2
Mb), peak 2 at marker D1mit354 (Bmd1b, at 172.98 Mb), and peak
3 at marker D1mit359 (designated as BMD1-4 at 177.4 Mb) (Fig.
1), which were significantly associated with femoral vBMD. Map-
Maker software also identified three significant linkages at the
same positions (Supplemental Table 1), which explained 9.3%,
10.7%, and 9% of the BMD variation within the B6.CAST

the variation in BMD phenotype be-
tween congenic and B6 mice cannot be
explained on the basis of size difference.

Gene expression profiling

In order to screen for potential BMD
candidate genes in the 172–176 Mb re-
gion, we compared the expression levels
of all known genes and ESTs located in
this region between the bones of the B6
control mice and the two congenic sub-
lines described above. We chose gene ex-
pression change to identify candidate
genes, since it is known that SNPs at
both the regulatory regions (promoter,
3⬘-UTR) and coding regions (via feed-
back loop) could affect the expression of
the gene (Schadt et al. 2003; Chesler et
al. 2005). In addition, this strategy has
been successfully used in a recent study
by Klein et al. (2004) to identify a QTL
gene that negatively regulates peak bone
density. Since C168–172 does not show
a BMD phenotype it was used as a nega-
tive control, so only genes that showed a
difference in the expression between
C168– 176 and B6 , bu t no t be tween
C168–172 and B6, were further ana-
lyzed. Among all genes analyzed, only
the Darc gene , located at 173 .6 Mb ,
showed a sixfold increase of the expres-
sion in the C168–176 congenic subline
when compared with the control pro-
genitors (Supplemental Table 2), while
no difference was found in expression
between the C168–172 and B6 control mice. Since none of the
other genes exhibited more than twofold difference that is sig-
nificant, we focused on Darc as a candidate gene.

Skeletal phenotype of Darc-KO mice

If the increase of Darc gene expression in B6.CAST-1 congenic
mice is responsible for the greater femur BMD exhibited by the
C168–176 mice, we would expect Darc knockout (KO) mice to
show a lower femur BMD compared with control mice. To test
this hypothesis, we compared the phenotype of Darc-KO mice
generated in a B6 background with that of age-gender-matched
wild-type B6 progenitors. Body weight as well as femur length
were similar for the two strains (Fig. 2), while total femur vBMD
was increased in the Darc-KO mice compared with the wild-type
control mice. The trabecular volume was 13% smaller in the
Darc-KO mice compared with the wild-type mice (P < 0.01), the
endosteal circumference was decreased by 3.8%, and there was
no change in periosteal circumference, which resembles the phe-
notype of the C168–176 subline and confirms the involvement
of the Darc gene in BMD variation. Based on these data we con-
sidered an alternate possibility that the high expression of Darc
might be secondary to a loss of the protein function.

SNP analyses

We next sequenced the Darc gene to determine the SNPs that
might be the cause of the difference in the expression between

C168–176, which indicates the approximate proximal and distal megabase limits known for the CAST
chromosomal region, and the congenic subline B6.CAST-1D1mit370-D1mit113 was designated as C168–
172. Data are expressed as a percentage of B6 and are mean Ⳳ SEM. (a) P < 0.01 as measured by

F2 population, respectively. Thus, Chr 1 contains at least four BMD
loci, three of which regulate BMD positively and one negatively.
Since the Bmd1b QTL showed the highest LOD score, we
chose to screen BMD candidate genes within this locus. There-
fore, to narrow down the size of the Bmd1b QTL region to permit
our candidate gene search, we generated additional congenic
sublines from the C168–185 subline, as described in Edderkaoui
et al. (2006). In the present study, we compared the skeletal phe-
notype of the congenic subline that carries the CAST chromo-
somal segment from D1mit370 to D1mit403 (168–176 Mb) and
the congenic subline that carried the CAST chromosomal region
D1mit370-D1mit113 (168–172 Mb) located between the first and
the second peaks/QTL with the B6 control mice (Fig. 1). The
congenic subline C168–176 exhibited a significantly greater
vBMD compared with the B6 mice (7.5%, P = 0.01), while C168–
172 did not show any differences compared with the B6 controls.
Using this data, we could safely eliminate the genes located at the
168–172 Mb chromosomal region from further analyses (Fig. 1),
which narrowed down the size of the Bmd1b locus to 172–176
Mb from the centromere in Chr 1. Furthermore, the C168–176
subline exhibited a significantly smaller femur trabecular volume
and reduced midshaft endosteal circumference, but no difference
in the periosteal circumference (Fig. 2). These changes contrib-
uted to an increase in the cortical thickness and correspondingly
higher vBMD in the femurs of C168–176 subline compared with
the B6 control mice. There was no difference in body weight
between C168–C176 and B6 control mice (Fig. 2), suggesting that

the NCBI database and in-house sequencing, we have identified
28 polymorphisms that distinguish the Darc gene in B6 from

moter region, 15 polymorphism sequences located at the inter-
vening sequence, and 10 polymorphisms at the coding region.

Among the polymorphisms in the coding region, only six led to
amino acid changes (Table 1). None of the polymorphisms dis-
covered in the promoter region covered the consensus sequences
that potentially regulate the transcription process, so it is likely
that the difference in the expression of the Darc gene is due to the
SNPs in the coding region. In order to determine if the SNPs in
the Darc gene could be responsible for BMD variation, we com-
pared the Darc gene sequence of B6 and CAST with another high
BMD strain, namely C3H/HeJ (C3H). We found that the six in-
formative SNPs in the coding region were conserved in both
CAST and C3H, suggesting that one or more of these SNPs could
contribute to the high BMD phenotype exhibited by CAST and
C3H mice (Table 1).

Binding assay

The Darc gene is an acidic glycoprotein that spans the plasma
membrane with seven transmembranous helices, like all mem-
bers of the G-protein-coupled chemokine receptors (Fig. 3). As
the name implies, the Darc protein is known to bind to several
chemokines such as CC chemokines, monocyte chemotactic pro-
tein-1 (Ccl2), Ccl5 (regulated on activation, normal T cell ex-
pressed and secreted), and interleukin-8 (Il8). These cytokines
have been shown to regulate formation and activity of osteo-
clasts via tumor necrosis factor ligand (Tnfsf11)-dependent
and -independent mechanisms (Wise et al. 2002; Bendre et al.
2003, 2005; Kim et al. 2005).
Tournamille et al. (1997) have reported
tha t the chemok ine b ind ing pocke t o f
the Darc protein is located in the first and
fourth extracellular domains, which are
brought into close vicinity by a disulfide
bridge (Fig. 3). Among the six SNPs found in
the coding region, the aspartic acid at posi-
tion 56 seems to be significant due to its
location close to the cysteine at position 49,
which is required to form the disulfide
bridge between transmembrane helices 1
and 7 in the chemokine binding pocket.
The change of a small and neutral amino
acid glycine with a negatively charged as-
partic acid could change the conformation
of the protein as well as the chemical envi-
ronment of the binding sites, which conse-
quently may affect the binding of the Darc
protein to the chemokines and/or the sta-
bility of Darc protein. Accordingly, we pre-
dict that the Darc protein in CAST binds to
chemokines much less efficiently compared
with the Darc protein from B6 mice. The
decreased protein function could contrib-
ute to increased expression as a conse-
quence of loss of the feedback control. To
test this hypothesis, we analyzed the bind-
ing of chemokines to nonadherent bone
marrow cells (NABMC) derived from Darc
knockout and congenic mice. We chose
Ccl2, Ccl5, and Il8 as ligands for the bind-
ing studies based on previous findings that
these chemokines bound to the Darc pro-
tein and all the three chemokines have been
shown to regulate osteoclast formation. By
using 125I-labeled Ccl2, Il8, and Ccl5 for the

5). In contrast, bone formation rate was not significantly differ-
ent in the femurs of Darc-KO mice compared with control mice
(Fig. 5). We are in the process of breeding a congenic subline of
mice carrying the Bmd1b locus for the purpose of performing
histomorphometry studies in order to confirm that the increased
BMD in congenic mice is also due to reduced bone resorption.

Discussion

Osteoporosis is a common disease characterized by reduced bone
mass and increased risk of fragility fractures. Because of the well
recognized importance of a genetic component in the pathogen-
esis of osteoporosis, there is now considerable interest among
researchers in the bone field to identify genes that contribute to
variation in peak bone mass. To identify osteoporosis genes, sev-
eral approaches have been employed that include association
studies and linkage analysis in humans and in experimental
model organisms. While the association studies have identified a
number of potential candidate genes that contribute to osteopo-
rosis susceptibility, relatively few candidate gene polymorphisms
have been validated by large-scale studies. Linkage studies in hu-
mans and various animal models, on the other hand, have re-
vealed evidence in almost every chromosome for the presence of
genetic loci that regulate bone mass (Beamer et al. 1999, 2001;
Koller et al. 2000; Kammerer et al. 2003; Karasik et al. 2004;
Volkman et al. 2004; Peacock et al. 2005; Ralston et al. 2005).
Together, the association and linkage studies point to the fact
that osteoporosis susceptibility is determined by a large number
of genes with a modest or small effect size and not by few genes
of major effect as originally thought. Accordingly, our data with
a large number of congenic strains carrying overlapping CAST
chromosomal segments from Chr 1 BMD QTL have revealed that
there are at least four BMD loci in Chr 1, each contributing to
4%–12% of the variation in peak bone mass (this work and Ed-
derkaoui et al. 2006).
The successful cloning of the QTL gene depends on the abil-
ity to resolve genetic effects into sufficiently small intervals to
make gene identification feasible. In this regard, we were able to
utilize strategies involving high-resolution mapping with a large
number of markers and congenic sublines of B6 mice containing
overlapping segments of CAST Chr 1 in the QTL region to suc-
cessfully narrow down the size of the Bmd1b locus to 4 Mb. Since
the 4-Mb regions did not contain any obvious functional candi-
date gene for peak bone mass, we utilized the alternate approach
of identifying candidate genes based on gene expression changes
and SNP analyses. This approach led to the identification of the
Darc gene, which was subsequently confirmed as a BMD QTL
gene by functional studies. Our findings along with those of
Klein et al. (2004) provide feasibility that the small effect of BMD
QTL genes can be identified by an integrated approach involving
fine mapping, use of congenic sublines containing the QTL gene,
gene expression profiling, SNP analyses, and functional studies.
In the current study, Darc was identified as a BMD QTL1-2
candidate gene based on differential expression and SNP analyses
between congenic sublines and B6 mice. The basis for the in-
creased expression of Darc in congenic mice can only be specu-
lated at this time. In this regard, it is possible that the loss of
protein function caused by changes in key amino acids in the
chemokine binding pocket could lead to increased expression
due to the loss of negative feedback. Accordingly, we found re-

Figure 3. Schematic presentation of the predicted model of Darc pro-
tein based on analogy with the Il8 type A receptor (modified from
Tournamille et al. 1997). The three cysteine residues that form the che-
mokine binding site are brought into close proximity by a disulfide bridge
between the first and the fourth extracellular domains of the Darc pro-
tein. The cysteine residue at the N terminus that forms the bridge is at

binding studies, we found that the specific binding of the three
chemokines was significantly reduced in the NABMC derived
from both the C168–176 subline and Darc-KO mice compared
with B6 mice (Fig. 4A).

In vitro osteoclast formation assay

Since Darc protein binds to a number of chemokines that regu-
late osteoclastogenesis, we next determined if reduced binding of
chemokines to Darc in congenic mice is associated with corre-
sponding changes in osteoclast formation.
We treated nonadherent bone marrow cells (NABMC) with
Tnfsf11 and macrophage colony stimulating factor (Csf1), the
two major cytokines reported to be involved in osteoclast forma-
tion (Quinn et al. 1998; Takahashi et al. 1999). The Darc-KO mice
showed a 50% decrease in the number of TRAP-positive MNC
compared with the wild-type mice. Furthermore, despite the in-
crease of Darc gene expression in C168–176, this subline showed
a 70% decreased formation of TRAP-positive MNC compared
with B6 control mice (Fig. 4B). In addition, treatment of NABMC
with Darc-antibody (Darc-Ab) in the presence of Tnfsf11 and
Csf1 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of TRAP-
positive multinucleated cells (Fig. 4C,D). These data together of-
fer strong evidence that Darc protein is involved in osteoclast
formation and/or activity, and that the reduced osteoclast for-
mation in the NABMC of CAST mice could be explained on the
basis of reduced activity of Darc protein in CAST mice compared
with B6 mice.

In vivo histomorphometry study

Consistent with the in vitro data, we found that the TRAP-
positive bone resorbing surface was significantly reduced both at
the endosteum (47% , P = 0 .002) and the per iosteum (8% ,
P = 0.02) of femurs isolated from Darc-KO mice compared with

involved in transcriptional regulation and/or mRNA stability. In
any case, the proof that the Darc gene is the BMD QTL1-2 gene
came from in vitro and in vivo functional studies. We have found
that Darc-knockout mice exhibited a similar skeletal phenotype
as that of the congenic subline of mice carrying the Bmd1b locus.
The higher BMD in the congenic subline of mice carrying the
Bmd1b locus and Darc-knockout mice is contributed by cortical
thickness that is caused by reduced endosteal circumference. The
reduced bone marrow cavity in the absence of functional Darc
could be due to reduced resorption and/or increased bone for-
mation at the endosteum. In this regard, our in vitro osteoclast
formation assay using NABMC revealed a significant reduction in
osteoclast formation in NABMC derived from congenic as well as
Darc-knockout mice compared with B6 mice. Consistent with
these data, bone resorption but not bone formation was signifi-
cantly reduced in the Darc-knockout mice compared with B6
mice. Based on these data, we conclude that Darc is a negative
regulator of osteoclasts and that bone resorption is reduced in the
absence of Darc, resulting in increased BMD.
As to how Darc regulates osteoclast formation, it is known
that Darc binds to chemokines that are involved in osteoclast
formation. Although Darc was first identified as Duffy blood

antigen (Pogo and Chaudhuri 2000), there is now considerable
evidence that Darc regulates cell trafficking and modulates the
bioavailability of several chemokines such as Ccl2 and Ccl5
(Chaudhuri et al. 2003; Kashiwazaki et al. 2003), which are che-
motactic signals for monocytes and are responsible for the mi-
gration of osteoclast precursors to fuse into differentiated osteo-
clasts (Kim et al. 2005). Therefore, based on our data and the
previously published data about Darc and the chemokines func-
tion, we postulate a model of Darc involvement in osteoclast
formation. As reported by Kim et al. (2005), the activation of
osteoclast precursors by Tnfsf11 and Csf1 leads to an increase in
the expression of Ccl2 and Ccl5, which are known to bind to
Darc. Since Darc is involved in cell trafficking, and based on our
finding that Darc-antibody inhibits osteoclast formation, we pos-
tulate that Darc–chemokine signaling is involved in osteoclast
precursors trafficking for subsequent fusion into differentiated
osteoclasts. Accordingly, the disruption of Duffy as in Darc-KO
mice or C168–176 mice would lead to an alteration of osteoclast
formation (Fig. 6). Our current studies are focused on testing the
possibility that Darc is involved in the trafficking of osteoclast
precursors for subsequent fusion.
In humans, the Duffy blood group system consists of four
alleles, five phenotypes, and five antigens (Pogo and Chaudhuri
2000). Duffy-negative individuals are predominantly Africans
and American blacks; they lack the Duffy protein on erythrocytes
and are resistant to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi
infections (Miller et al. 1975, 1976). In addition, it has been well
established that African-Americans exhibit significantly higher
BMD compared with Caucasians (Yanovski et al. 2000; Cauley et
al. 2005). Our finding that total femur vBMD is increased in
Darc-KO mice compared with B6 mice raises the interesting pos-
sibility that BMD variation between African-Americans and Cau-
casians could be due in part to a difference in the function of
Darc between the two groups.
Since Darc-KO mice were generated in a mixed genetic back-
ground involving 129 and B6 strains, it is important to rule out
the possibility that another gene contributed by the 129 strain
was responsible for the increased BMD in the Darc-KO mice. In
this regard, Darc-KO mice used in this study have been back-
crossed with B6 mice for at least eight generations to minimize
the genetic contribution of the 129 strain. After eight back-
crosses, the genetic contribution of the donor strain is estimated
to be <1% (Silver 1995). Accordingly, much of Chr 1 is derived

from B6 mice except a small region surrounding the Darc gene
that was found to be homozygous for 129 (171–177 Mb), which
was not surprising since homologous recombination to disrupt
the Darc gene was carried out using stem cells derived from 129
mice, and since mice carrying the Darc-KO gene from 129 were
selected for subsequent backcrosses with B6 mice. Our findings
that NABMC derived from both congenic and Darc-KO mice ex-
hibit reduced potential to form TRAP-positive multinucleated os-
teoclasts in vitro and that blockage of Darc action using neutral-
izing antibody to Darc reduced osteoclast formation in NABMC
derived from B6 mice provided further experimental data for the
Darc being the Chr 1 BMD QTL2 gene. However, the ultimate
proof for Darc as a BMD QTL gene will require knock-in of a CAST
copy of the Darc gene in the B6 background or vice versa and
demonstration of the corresponding BMD phenotype in the
knock-in mice.
In conclusion, this was the first study, to our knowledge, to
provide strong evidence that the Darc gene plays an important
role in regulating femur BMD via controlling osteoclastogenesis.
Investigations into the molecular mechanism by which the
Duffy protein regulates osteoclastogenesis could lead to the de-
velopment of novel drug targets for the diagnosis and/or treat-
ment of osteoporosis.

Methods

Mice

The study used two inbred strains of mice, C57BL/6J (B6) and
CAST/EiJ (CAST), which have been previously shown to differ
widely in total femur vBMD at 16 wk of age (Beamer et al. 1999).
The rationale for selecting these two inbred mouse strains was
based on the fact that these strains are highly polymorphic for
genetic differences at >95% of their genomes (Dietrich et al.
1996). The B6.CAST F2 mice were produced and maintained at
the animal research facility of The Jackson Laboratory (TJL; Bar
Harbor, ME), as previously described (Beamer et al. 1999), while
the congenic sublines of mice were generated and maintained at
the Jerry L. Pettis VA Medical Center (LL; Loma Linda, CA) under
the standard conditions previously described by Edderkaoui et al.
(2006). The animal work performed in this study was approved
by the institutional animal care and use committees at both TJL
and LL. Darc-knockout (Darc-KO) mice as well as the control mice
were generated as previously described by Luo et al. (2000), and
were bred and maintained in LL under the same conditions pre-
viously described by Edderkaoui et al. (2006).

Fine mapping the B6.CAST F2 population

Spleens from 565 B6.CAST F2 female mice were received from
Wes Beamer (TJL) to be used for genotyping. Extractions of ge-
nomic DNA from the spleens were performed following the Gen-
tra PurGene protocol (PUREGENE Tissue kit, part no. D-7000A).
In order to fine map the BMD QTL in Chr 1, we used 33 poly-
morphic markers located within the BMD QTL region that covers
24.6 cM in mouse Chr 1, between D1mit106 and D1mit511 as
described by Edderkaoui et al. (2006), instead of the seven mark-
ers that were previously used to identify the major BMD QTL in
this region (Beamer et al. 1999). The number of markers was
increased in order to detect and evaluate the effect of more po-
tential recombinations within the major QTL region.
Genotyping data from the F2 population were analyzed us-
ing MapQTL (4.0) software (CPRO-DLO), and Mapmaker soft-
ware was used to test the reproducibility of MapQTL data.
MapQTL interval mapping was used for quantitative trait loci

mapping, and the LOD score significant thresholds were calcu-
lated using MapQTL permutation tests at a confidence level of
99%.

Generation of congenic sublines and genotyping

The B6.CAST-1D1mit370-D1mit152 congenic (C168–185) subline, pre-
viously described by Edderkaoui et al. (2006), was used to gener-
ate more congenic sublines and break down the cast region first
transferred to the B6 background. Additional crosses between the
C168–185 congenic subline and the B6 progenitor produced new
recombinations carrying smaller overlapping segments that were
fixed by crossing the heterozygous mice of same recombination
between one another. Each subline was genotyped using the
polymorphic markers that encompass the region 168–185 Mb
from the centromere (Edderkaoui et al. 2006).
Darc-KO mice were generated as previously described (Papa-
ioannou and Johnson 1993; Luo et al. 2000) and backcrossed
with C57BL mice. DNA extraction and genotyping were per-
formed as described by Edderkaoui et al. (2006).

Phenotypic analyses

Based on data from previous studies, which showed that rapid
acquisition of vBMD peaked at ∼16 wk, resulting in significant
higher density values in the CAST females compared with the B6
females (Beamer et al. 1999), only females were used in this study
and all measurements were performed at 16 wk of age.
All the measurements for the B6.CAST F2 mice were per-
formed at TJL as described by Beamer et al. (1999). For the B6
control mice and B6.CAST-1 congenic sublines of mice, bones
were stored and processed as described by Edderkaoui et al.
(2006).
The measured parameters for the congenic sublines of mice
as well as knockout mice were expressed as the percentage of B6
control mice and were mean Ⳳ SEM. Characteristics of the con-
genic sublines as well as knockout mice were compared with the
B6 control progeny using a Student’s t-test, and differences were
judged statistically significant when P < 0.05. Data from the con-
genic sublines mice were compared with B6 progenitors provided
by TJL and bred in LL, while the Darc-KO mice data were com-
pared with the B6 control mice provided by Dr. Chaudhuri (New
York Blood Center, New York) and bred in LL.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR analyses

We isolated total RNA from femurs without bone marrow follow-
ing the protocol supplied by Life Technologies Company using
Trizol reagent. Since the BMD phenotype was analyzed in 16-wk-
old female mice, only female mice 14 wk of age were used for
gene expression studies to screen for candidate genes responsible
for this phenotype. We synthesized cDNA by priming 500 ng of
total RNA with oligodT in the presence of M-MLV-reverse tran-
s c r ip t a s e fo l low in g th e m anu f a c tu r e r ’ s p ro to co l (h t tp : / /
www.promega.com/tbs/9pim170/9pim170.pdf).
The quantification of mRNAs was performed in the ABI
Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems)
using SYBR Green as a detector dye. The reaction mixture con-
tained 12.5 µL of Brilliant SYBR Green (Stratagene), 2 pmol of
each primer, 1 µL of template cDNA, and RNase-free water to a
final volume of 25 µL. The oligonucleotide primers were desig-
nated in order to amplify the most specific sequence in the cod-
ing region of each gene or EST. The relative differences in expres-
sion between the groups were determined using cycle time (Ct)
values as follows: The Ct values of the genes of interest were first
normalized with 18S of the same sample; then the relative dif-
ferences between the B6 mice and congenic sublines of mice were

M o u s e D u f f y i s a BM D c a n d i d a t e g e n e i n C h r 1

calculated and expressed as relative increases or decreases, setting
the control as 100%. Assuming the Ct value reflects the initial
starting copy and there is 100% efficiency, a difference of one
cycle is equivalent to a twofold difference in starting copy.
If a significant difference in the expression between the con-
genic sublines and B6 mice was found for a certain gene, another
pair of primers was used to confirm the results, so only the genes
that showed a difference with at least two pairs of primers are
reported herein. For the Darc gene, we have used four pairs of
primers. The first two pairs of primers showed a 12-fold increase
of the RNA expression in C168–176 compared with B6 mice.
However, after sequence analysis, we found that the two primers
used for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) covered the polymorphism se-
quences between B6 and CAST, so we decided to design new
primers to determine whether the difference showed by RT-PCR
was due to the mismatch or due to any difference in mRNA
levels. The new primers that do not cover any SNP showed a
sixfold increase of Darc expression in the C168–176 compared
with B6 control mice.
The primers used to determine Darc gene expression level

are:
Darc-F1. TCGGGTGGAAACCCTTTCA
Darc-R1. AGCTGGTGTCAGGCTGTAGTCA
Darc-F2. CCTGAATCCCAGACTGAATATTGG
Darc-R2. GAAAGGTGCAGAAGCCATTGTAA
Darc-F3. CCCATTCTGGCAGAGTTAGCA
Darc-R3. TCAACAGAGCTTGGGGAAAAA
Darc-F4. TTCTTCCACTGGCAGATTTGC
Darc-R4. ACCATACCCAGTAGCCCAGGTT

SNPs analyses

We identified SNPs by direct DNA sequence analysis of PCR prod-
ucts. To sequence the promoter region, we have designated prim-
ers using the DNA sequence reported by Luo et al. (2000). More
primers were designated to amplify overlapping regions from the
start codon to the stop codon of the Darc gene using a B6 se-
quence from NCBI, accession no. AC084073.

Chemokine binding to nonadherent bone marrow cells

Bone marrow cells were obtained from femurs isolated from
6-wk-old female B6, C168–176 subline, and Darc-KO mice. Fe-
murs were dissected, the ends of the bones were cut, and the
marrow was flushed out using a 2-mL syringe and transferred
into 15-mL Falcon tubes. Bone marrow cells were dispersed by
repeated aspiration of the cell preparation containing Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-
inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone). Cells were seeded
in 10-cm petri dishes and incubated at 37°C in a humidifier in-
cubator with 5% CO2. After 24 h, all NABMC were transferred to
new 50-mL Falcon tubes and were then counted with a hemocy-
tometer. Cells were then spun down, the supernatant was re-
moved, and the pellet was resuspended in binding medium
(DMEM supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA at pH 7.4).
Each reaction contained 2–4 ⳯ 106 cells in a total volume of 250
µL of binding buffer. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with
200,000 CPM 125I-MCP1 (Ccl2)/Il8 and with or without unla-
beled murine Ccl2/Human recombinant Il8 (PeproTech). We
have found that Ccl5 binds better at room temperature (RT), so
the cells were incubated with 125I-RANTES (Ccl5) fo r 3 h at RT
with and without unlabeled murine RANTES (Ccl5). The reac-
tions were terminated by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 rpm.
The supernatant was removed and the precipitates were washed
three times with the binding buffer. Then the radioactivity was

quantified using a gamma counter. Each reaction was carried out
using 8–10 replicates.

Cell culture

NABMC were isolated as described above. The pellet was resus-
pended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at a density of
8 ⳯ 105 cells/mL. Cells were then seeded into 24-well plates at a
density of 2 ⳯ 105 cells/well and treated with murine soluble
Tnfsf11 (100 ng/mL, Peprotech) and murine colony-stimulating
factor (Csf1, 100 ng/mL, Peprotech). The cultures were main-
tained for up to 10 d and re-fed twice a week. After 10 d of
treatment, the adherent osteoclasts were rinsed with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS), fixed with citrate (4%)–acetone (60%), and
then stained using a Leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (Sigma-
Aldrich). A Darc-specific polyclonal antibody (Darc-Ab) gener-
ated in a goat model against the N-terminal domain of the Darc
mouse protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to neutralize
the Darc protein of B6 wild-type mice. NABMC were treated for
6 d with Tnfsf11 and Csf1 (as described above) in presence of
Darc-Ab or control IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). Then the TRAP-positive
(pink/purple) multinucleated (MNC) osteoclasts were visualized
and counted under light microscopy, and only cells with more
than two nuclei were considered.

Histomorphometry study

Femurs from 8-wk-old Darc-KO mice and wild-type B6 mice were
defleshed and embedded in methylmethacrylate. Thick cross sec-
tions (0.5-mm thickness) were cut from the midpoint of the shaft
with a diamond wire Histo-saw (Delaware Diamond Knives). The
cross sections were ground lightly, mounted in aqueous Fluoro-
mount-G (Fisher Scientific), and examined under an Olympus
BH-2 fluorescent/brightfield microscope to measure bone areas
and calcein labels. All bone histomorphometric parameters were
measured as previously described (Kasukawa et al. 2003).
