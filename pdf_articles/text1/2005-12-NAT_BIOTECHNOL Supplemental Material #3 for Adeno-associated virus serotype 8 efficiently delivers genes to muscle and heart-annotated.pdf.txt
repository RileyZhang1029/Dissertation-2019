Supplementary Figure 3  High-efficiency d-sarcoglycan (d -SG) gene 

transfer and profound improvement in histopathology of heart and muscle 

of TO-2 hamsters. Six -week -old Adult TO-2 hamsters were injected 1 × 
10 12 v.g. of dsAAV8-d -SG vector. Heart and leg muscles (triceps) were 
analyzed by d -SG immunofluorescent staining and H & E histology 

staining at 7 months after vector delivery. Supra-normal expression of 
d-GS in numerous cardiomyocytes was apparent (white arrowheads). 

Severe fibrosis and calcification in untreated heart were visible (black 
arrows). Efficient d -GS expression in limb muscle also resulted in normal 

histology, whereas the untreated muscle showed extensive degeneration 

and regeneration, as shown by the presence of centrally localized nuclei 

in myofibers (blue color of DAPI counter staining and H & E staining).
