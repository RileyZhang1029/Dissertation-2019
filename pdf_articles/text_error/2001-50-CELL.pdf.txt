Coregulation of Daughter-Specific Genes and Analysis of Existing WholeGenome Expression Data
(a) Expression of the “SIC1 cluster” genes as yeast progress through the cell cycle after release from  factor-, cdc15-2-, and cdc284-arrest and after collection from an elutriation chamber (Spellman et al., 1998). Members of the first group of daughter-specific genes defined here (CTS1, CST13, DSE1, DSE2, SCW11, DSE3, DSE4 and PRY3) are underlined and marked with a circle. Note that CTS1, CST13, DSE1, DSE2, and SCW11 belong to one branch of this cluster (in cyan) while DSE3 and DSE4 belong to another.
These two genes differ in their regulation from the other daughter-specific genes in response to some perturbations; in particular, DSE3 and DSE4 are not induced by  factor. (b) Daughter-specific genes (marked with circles) are coregulated in response to deletion of different genes (Hughes et al., 2000). Each column corresponds to a different deletion or drug treatment.
(c) Unconditional and conditional daughterspecific genes (marked with circles) cluster together in the environmental stress response data set (Gasch et al., 2000). Stress conditions are heat shock (HS), increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), menadione (M), dithiothreitol (dtt), diamide (D) and sorbitol (Sor), time after amino acid deprivation (aa), nitrogen depletion (N dpl) or growth on YPD (YPD), time course of diauxic shift (DS) or steady state (SS), and growth in different carbon sources (CS). In (a) and (b), we clustered the original raw data using the Cluster software (Eisen et al., 1998); in (c), the clustering was performed by Gasch et al. (2000). Red indicates upregulation and green indicates downregulation with respect to reference mRNA from cells grown asynchronously (a), from wild-type cells (b), and from cells that were not perturbed by stressful treatment (c). Gray boxes indicate data missing from the published datasets.

Since YFP-Ace2 was degraded in late G1 in both cell types, it seemed possible that YFP-Ace2 disappeared faster from mother nuclei because mothers complete G1 more rapidly. To test this possibility, we made a strain that carried the cdc15-2 allele and used this temperature-sensitive mutation to arrest cells at telophase. Mothers and daughters released from such arrest cycle nearly synchronously during the first cell division (Futcher, 1999). After release from cdc15 block, YFP-Ace2 still accumulated in daughter nuclei after a transient state in which it localized to both nuclei (not

daughter nuclei (Figure 5a). Similarly, Cbk1-M429A cells treated with inhibitors showed no YFP fluorescence from PCTS1 and other daughter-specific reporters (not shown). These experiments indicate that Cbk1 kinase activity is required for specific accumulation of Ace2 in the daughter nucleus, and also for an additional function needed to activate transcription of daughter-specific genes.
Active Ectopic Ace2 Activates Daughter-Specific Genes in Mothers
To determine if translocation of active Ace2 to the daughter nucleus was sufficient to bring about daughter-specific gene expression, we delivered active Ace2 to the mother nucleus and determined whether active ectopic Ace2 could induce daughter-specific genes in mothers. Activation and proper localization of wild-type Ace2 requires Cbk1 and Mob2. We reasoned that an Ace2 gain-of-function mutant such as Ace2-G128E, which is active in cbk1 mutants (Racki et al., 2000), might accumulate in both nuclei. To test this idea, we used a reporter plasmid expressing YFP-Ace2-G128E controlled by PACE2 in wt cells. This Ace2 mutant accumulated in mother and daughter nuclei at the end of mitosis (Figure 5b). We then constructed a strain which expressed Ace2-G128E instead of Ace2 and examined expression of PCTS1-YFP. In this strain, PCTS1-YFP expression was visible in both mothers and daughters (Figure 5c). These results are consistent with the idea that localization of Ace2 to the daughter nucleus and its activation by Cbk1/Mob2 are sufficient for daughter-specific gene expression.
Cbk1, Mob2, and Ace2 Are Required to Localize One Another
Cbk1 and Mob2 were required to localize Ace2 to the daughter nucleus. Since Cbk1 and Mob2 interacted and colocalized to the growing bud tip, the bud neck, and born. At that time, phosphorylation by Cdc28 causes accumulation of Ace2 in the cytoplasm (O’Conallain et al., 1999). At the end of anaphase, when Cdc28 kinase activity drops, Ace2 specifically accumulates in the daughter nucleus. Our data suggest that initially, Cbk1/ Mob2-activated Ace2 translocates to both mother and daughter nuclei, perhaps in a complex with Mob2 and Cbk1. Later, import into the mother nucleus stops, and Ace2 in the mother nucleus is either degraded or exported. Meanwhile, import of activated Ace2 into the daughter nucleus triggers expression of daughter-specific genes.

Cell Separation
Cells lacking CBK1 or its target genes CTS1 and SCW11 show defects in mother-daughter separation (Kuranda and Robbins, 1991, Cappellaro et al., 1998). CTS1 encodes chitinase. SCW11 encodes a protein with sequence similarity to glucanases. DSE2 and DSE4 also encode secreted proteins with sequence similarity to glucanases. It seems likely, then, that at least these four
