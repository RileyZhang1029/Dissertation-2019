Abstract

The signiÔ¨Åcant developments in the genetic selection of fast-growing broiler chickens cause difÔ¨Åculties for broilers in
coping with extreme environmental conditions. This study was conducted to elucidate the effect of repetitive short-term
increases in incubation temperature on hatchability and chick‚Äôs body weight (BW) and thermoregulation immediately
after hatch. Thermal manipulation (TM) had no effect on hatchability when the three trials were combined for
statistical analysis, and had no effect on chick‚Äôs BW. It caused a signiÔ¨Åcant reduction in chicks Tb; and signiÔ¨Åcant
decline in plasma thyroid hormones concentration, but had no effect on plasma corticosterone concentration. It can be
concluded that TM did not affect BW but had a positive effect on thermoregulation, most probably in reducing
metabolic rate.

1. Introduction

Recent decades have seen signiÔ¨Åcant developments in
the genetic selection of fast-growing meat-type broiler
chickens. However, this fast growth has coincided with
inferior development of the visceral systems (Havenstein
et al., 2003), causing signiÔ¨Åcant difÔ¨Åculties for broiler
chickens in coping with extreme environmental condi-
tions, i.e., hot spells. To sustain thermal tolerance and to

Hurwitz, 1996; Yahav, 2000, 2002), which exploited the
immaturity of the temperature regulation mechanism in
young chicks during their Ô¨Årst week of life (Dunnington
and Siegel, 1984; Modrey and Nichelmann, 1992).
However, post-hatch environmental temperature ma-

manipulations during incubation would be very likely to
lead to a better thermal response of
the embryo,

chicken.

respectively, in the post-hatch phase (Decuypere, 1984;
Minne and Decuypere, 1984; Janke et al., 2002).

The effects of the duration of alterations of the
incubation temperature can be divided according to
short or long term. A short-term increase of incubation

found to activate the heat

Thyroid hormones are well known to affect develop-
ment of chick embryos (McNabb and King, 1993). Up
to half of the incubation duration, the thyroid gland
appears to possess a limited capability to synthesize
hormones (Thommes, 1987). However, after the hy-
pothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis has been linked at
days 10.5‚Äì11.5 of incubation, the thyroid gland has
begun to function. The concentrations of
thyroid
hormones increase signiÔ¨Åcantly prior to hatching,
in
preparation for their major role in the Ô¨Ånal maturation
of many tissues and their role in integrating physiolo-
gical factors to achieve a successful hatch (Black, 1978;
Mallon and Betz, 1982; Decuypere et al., 1992).

Another important effect of thermal manipulation
(TM) is related to stress. Epple et al. (1997) suggested
that the embryonic chicken is susceptible to stress.
Increasing incubation temperature during the 16th day
of
incubation, while the hypothalamic-hypophysial-
adrenal axis is being activated (Wise and Frye, 1975),
may affect the stress response of the hatched chick.

The present study aimed to elucidate the effects of
repetitive short-term increases in incubation tempera-
ture, prior to chick embryonic stage 45, on the hatching
rate, body weight (BW) and thermoregulation of Cobb
chicks.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Experimental procedure

Three independent trials were conducted to elucidate
the effects of TMs during embryogenesis on hatching
rate, chick BW and thermoregulation immediately after
hatch. Fertile Cobb eggs from Ô¨Çocks at their optimal
period for egg production were used. In the Ô¨Årst two
trials, 200 eggs were weighed and statistically divided
according to JMPs statistics (SAS Institute, 2000) into
10 groups of 10 eggs in each treatment. In the third trial
400 eggs were weighed and statistically divided into 20
groups of 10 eggs in each treatment.

In each trial, the eggs were arranged in homological
locations in two incubators. The incubators (Masalles,
Spain, Type 65Hs), were identical and automatic.

Incubation conditions from day 0 to day 21 were:
37.8C and 56% rh (Bruzual et al., 2000) for the control
group. In the thermally treated eggs during E16, E17
and E18, temperature was increased to 38.5C and rh to
65% for 3 h (09:00‚Äì12:00) on each day. Immediately
after the thermal treatments were terminated, incubation
conditions were restored to the regular levels. Eggs in
both incubators were turned through 270 every hour.
Data loggers, Microlog of Fourier Systems, UIL Ltd.
were placed in each incubator to monitor the conditions
every 30 min.

At the 10th day of incubation, infertile and undeve-
loped eggs were removed after candling. At the 19th day
of incubation, the eggs were transferred to hatching
trays located in each incubator.

In each trial, hatched chicks were removed continu-
ously and alternately from both incubators, and the
number of chicks hatched was recorded every hour. In
the last trial, the data on the Ô¨Årst and the last quarters of
the hatched chicks of each treatment and each gender
were used to compare the BWs of early- and late-
hatched birds. After hatching and feather drying
(approximately 2 h post-hatch), each chick was taken
out of the incubator for further measurements which
were conducted in the following order: Tb; BW; gender
identiÔ¨Åcation; and blood sampling from the jugular vein
of randomly chosen chicks. Females were recognized by
a ‚Äò‚Äòcomb-like‚Äô‚Äô feather arrangement (alternating heights)
of the lateral wing feathers.

2.2. Blood analysis

Radioimmunoassay of thyroxin (T4) and triiodothyr-
onine (T3) was performed in plasma samples, using
commercial Radioimmunoassay kits: Coat-A-Count,
Canine, T4 and T3 kits‚Äî(Diagnostic products Corpora-
tion). The T3 assay was characterized by intra- and
inter-assay variation (cv) of 7.0% and 9.4%, respec-
tively. The T4 assay was characterized by intra- and
inter-assay variation (cv) of 5.0% and 7.5%, respec-
tively.

Plasma corticosterone concentration was measured
with the Radioimmunoassay kit with the ImmuChemt
Double Antibody (ICN Biomedical, Inc., Diagnostics
Division).

2.3. Statistical analysis

Data were subjected to analysis of variance (one way
ANOVA) and to Student‚Äôs t test, by means of the JMPs
software (SAS institute, 2000). Hatchability was ana-
lyzed with the chi-square test. A combined analysis of
hatchability of the three trials was made by Mann and
Whitney test. Means were considered signiÔ¨Åcantly
different at Pp0:05:

3. Results

The hatching rate was signiÔ¨Åcantly enhanced by the
thermal treatment in trial 1 (92.3% vs. 86.9% in the
treated and control embryos, respectively). In trial 2, a
signiÔ¨Åcant and opposite trend was observed: 89% of

treated embryos were hatched compared with 95% of
the control ones. In trial 3, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant
difference between the treatments: hatchability was
94.6% and 96.8% among the treated and control
embryos, respectively. However, a combined analysis
of hatchability of the three trials had demonstrated no
effect of TM on this parameter (P ¬º 0:827).

The BWs of chicks that were not differentiated
according to gender did not differ between treatments
(Trial 1; Table 1). In Trial 2 (Table 2), thermal treatment
did not affect the BW of either gender, but the males
were signiÔ¨Åcantly heavier than the females. In the third
trial (Table 3), there were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences in
BW between genders or between treatments. However,
when the chicks of each gender or treatment were
separated according to hatching time, the late-hatching
females were found to be signiÔ¨Åcantly heavier than the
others.

was signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than that of the control chicks. In
Trial 3, in which chicks were divided according to early
and late time of hatch, early hatched females exhibited a
signiÔ¨Åcantly lower Tb than the late-hatched chicks.
Thermally treated males exhibited similar trend, but
control males had a similar Tb; that was not affected by
hatching time.

Plasma thyroid hormone concentrations were signiÔ¨Å-
cantly lower in chicks that had been thermally treated
during embryogenesis than in the control ones (Trial 1,
Table 1). In Trial 3 (Table 5), only the plasma T3
concentration of the male treated group was signiÔ¨Å-
cantly lower. No signiÔ¨Åcant differences
in plasma
corticosterone concentration were observed (Table 5).

4. Discussion

One of the major concerns in dealing with domestic
animals is how to maintain or even improve perfor-
mance when various manipulative treatments are being
applied.

It was well documented previously that prolonged
heat exposure during the Ô¨Årst week of the chicks‚Äô life
(Yahav and Hurwitz, 1996), or exposure to extremely
high ambient
temperatures (Yahav and McMurtry,
2001) adversely affected the performance of broiler
chickens, although it improved their thermotolerance.
On the other hand, application of a moderate thermal
treatment not only increased thermotolerance, but it
also signiÔ¨Åcantly improved performance (Yahav, 2000;
Halevy et al., 2001).

In the present study, a moderate thermal treatment
was used (38.5C; 65% rh) to minimize any deleterious
effect of the treatment on hatchability and BW of the
chicks after hatch. Indeed out of the three trials, one
demonstrated signiÔ¨Åcant increase in hatching rate, the
second exhibited a signiÔ¨Åcant reduction in hatching rate,
and in the third no differences in hatchability between
treatments were observed. However, a combined statis-
tic analysis had shown no effect of the treatment on
hatchability. The differences may result therefore from a
small number of eggs per treatment.

As for chick‚Äôs BW immediately after hatch, in the
present study no signiÔ¨Åcant effect of
the thermal
treatment during incubation was observed in any of
the three trials. The signiÔ¨Åcant differences observed in
trial 2 were related to the genders. Previous results on
BW differences between males and females after
hatching were conÔ¨Çicting. Some authors (Godfrey and
Jaap, 1952; Khan et al., 1975; Whiting and Pesti, 1983)
found male chicks to be heavier than females, but others
found no gender differences in BW of day-old chicks
(Marks, 1986; Burke, 1992; Reis et al., 1997). In Trial 3,
the signiÔ¨Åcant differences in BW between the early and
late-hatching control females must also be considered in
light of conÔ¨Çicting results in the literature (Hager and
Beane, 1983; Reis et al., 1997).

In the present study, the goal of TM during E16‚ÄìE18
was to elucidate the possibility of changing the embryo‚Äôs
threshold for response to a hot environment, before the
main activities
related to thyroid hormones and
preparation for hatching increased signiÔ¨Åcantly (Decuy-
pere et al., 1992), and such changes were observed in
chicks during their Ô¨Årst week of
the
mechanisms that induced thermotolerance involved the
modulation of heat production, as a result of a
signiÔ¨Åcant and sustained reduction in plasma T3 levels
(Yahav and Hurwitz, 1996; Yahav and McMurtry,
2001). The Ô¨Ånding that chicks could reduce plasma T3
concentration further during thermal challenge sug-
gested that there was a reduction in metabolic rate that
led to improved thermotolerance acquisition (Yahav,
2000).

life. One of

In the present study, the plasma concentration of
thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) was lower to signiÔ¨Åcantly
lower in thermally treated than in control embryos,
immediately after hatch. The reduction in plasma T4
concentration suggested that there was a decline in the
thyroid gland activity, whereas the decline in T3 could be
attributed to reduced peripheral deiodination activity.
These results, together with the Ô¨Ånding of a signiÔ¨Åcant
decline in body temperature of the chicks which had
been thermally treated during embryogenesis, suggest
that there was a reduction in the metabolic rate of the
chicks, and may support the hypothesis of a change in

ARTICLE IN PRESS

249

the threshold of the response of the animals to heat.
However, this must be further studied.

Chicks that were thermally conditioned with low
(Shinder et al., 2002) or elevated ambient temperatures
(Yahav, unpublished data) during the Ô¨Årst week of life
subsequently exhibited reduced levels of the hormone
corticosterone, which suggests a possible change in the
‚Äò‚Äòset point‚Äô‚Äô of response to stress. However, in the present
study, although the incubation temperature was in-
creased during the period of hypothalamic-hypophyseal-
adrenal activation, there was no effect of the treatment
on the post-hatch plasma corticosterone concentration,
which suggests that the treatment had no effect on the
stress response of 1-day-old chicks.

It can be concluded that thermal treatments during
E16‚ÄìE18 of the chick‚Äôs embryogenesis, did not affect
hatchability and BW of
the 1-day-old chick. The
Ô¨Åndings reinforced the evidence for a positive effect on
thermoregulation, with reductions in Tb and in the
plasma thyroid hormone concentrations, which most
probably resulted in a reduced metabolic rate. It can
also be speculated that this treatment did not alter the
stress response of the hatched chicks.

5. Summary

TM (altering incubation temperature and relative
humidity to 38.5C and 65%, respectively, for 3 h in
each of the 16th, 17th and 18th days of incubation)
during broilers embryogenesis had no effect on the
hatchability of the combined trials, and no effect on BW
of the hatched chicks. However, in all experiments, Tb of
chicks exposed to TM during incubation was signiÔ¨Å-
cantly lower than that of the control ones. Both thyroid
hormones were lower to signiÔ¨Åcantly lower in the treated
chicks, whereas there was no effect on plasma cortico-
sterone concentration. It can be concluded that TM
during the 16‚Äì18 days of incubation, did not affect BW
of the 1-day-old chicks, but had a controversial effect on
hatchability. However,
it had a positive effect on
thermoregulation, by causing a reduction in Tb and in
plasma thyroid hormone concentrations, which most
probably resulted in a reduced metabolic rate. It can be
further speculated that the thermal treatment did not
alter the stress response of hatched chicks.
