An ample understanding of the complex interactions between host and pathogen will
improve our ability to develop new prophylactic and therapeutic measures against infec-
tion. Precise classiﬁcation of infectious agents in regards to their infective lifestyles in the
host and corresponding pathogenic implications are required because clear concepts are
essential to plan fruitful research. Classically, pathogenic bacteria are classiﬁed as extra-
cellular, facultative intracellular, and obligate intracellular. In my opinion, this classiﬁcation
is inadequate because, as concluded from data here discussed, it is based on inconsisten-
cies and hyper-valorizes the capacity of the infectious agent replicate in vitro in cell-free
media. For a microbial pathogen, what matters is whether intra- or extracellularity is in the
context of the in vivo life and in association with pathogenicity. When living as a pathogen
in association with its host, what is relevant in microbiological terms is not the ability to
grow in artiﬁcial cell-free bacteriological media or in environmental niches but whether the
intracellular infectious agent, besides the phase of intracellular growth which is behind its
label, also is able to live extracellularly in the natural settings of the extracellular territories
of their hosts. To eliminate the inconsistencies associated with the classical labeling of
bacterial pathogens, I propose that bacterial pathogens be labeled exclusive extracellular,
dual intracellular/extracellular and exclusive intracellular based on their infective lifestyle in
the host, not in the ability to grow in artiﬁcial bacteriological media.

Keywords: extracellular pathogens, facultative intracellular pathogens, obligate intracellular pathogens, dual
intra/extracellular pathogens

INTRODUCTION
Infectious diseases continue to be a major threat to human health.
Factors that contribute to this include the changes in life style
such as the increasing migration, the rising resistance of pathogens
to antibiotherapy, the increasing number of immunosuppressed
patients, and potential bioterrorism threats. Thus, the need for
the development of improved antimicrobial chemotherapeutics
and prophylaxis strategies is increasing. An ample understand-
ing of the complex interactions between host and pathogen will
substantially improve our ability to develop such new measures.
In this sense, the classiﬁcation of infectious agents in regards to
their infective lifestyles in the host and corresponding pathogenic
implications must be precisely deﬁned because clear concepts are
essential to direct fruitful research including in prophylactic and
therapeutic areas.

In symbiotic associations, parasitism is characterized by the
cause of host disease by the microbe. Thus, pathogenic microbes
are infective when they are associated with their hosts and live
from pathogenicity producing host damage, although they may
have separate ways of life like survival or replication in the envi-
ronment. Residence and multiplication of bacterial pathogens
at environmental niches originates a route for transmission to
human and animal hosts through water, food, air, and vectors,
and promotes interaction with free-living protozoa (Yildiz, 2007),
therefore being contributing factors for microbial survival that
increase the changes of a pathogen being a disease producer but

that do not operate as factors of pathogenicity during the in vivo
infection. Moreover, the ability to replicate extracellularly in vitro
requires metabolic pathways and corresponding genes different
from those used in the extracellular growth in the host (Fuchs
et al., 2012). In the present text the analysis is focused on the path-
ogenic life of bacterial parasites since the discussion is related to
the traditional classiﬁcation of bacteria while pathogens. Clas-
sically, infectious agents are labeled as extracellular, facultative
intracellular, and obligate intracellular pathogens (Goodpasture,
1936; Moulder, 1962; Brubaker, 1985). Discussion of published
data revealed inconsistencies with that classiﬁcation of bacterial
pathogens. These inconsistencies (Box 1) will be analyzed in this
article and alternatives proposed.

EXTRACELLULAR PATHOGENS
Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aerug-
inosa, Escherichia coli are typical examples of bacteria which
have been labeled extracellular pathogens, and wound infec-
tions, osteomyelitis, scarlet fever, certain forms of pneumonia,
urinary tract infections are examples of infections caused by
these pathogens (Nahm et al., 1999; Weiser and Nahm, 2008). To
produce disease, extracellular pathogens use any portal of entry
provided a satisfactory ﬂuid medium be established at the site of
injury. Typically, these pathogens multiply in the host at extra-
cellular sites such as mucosal surfaces, vascular, lymphatic, and
body cavity ﬂuids, and in interstitial spaces (Stuart and Ezekowitz,

Classiﬁcation of bacterial pathogens

Box 1 Inconsistencies in the classical labeling of bacterial pathogens.

1. The ability of the pathogen to grow in artiﬁcial cell-free media has been hyper-valorized.
2. Some extracellular bacterial pathogens have been shown to have an intracellular in vivo phase which has pathogenic implications.
3. In the labels “facultative intracellular pathogen” or “facultative intracellular parasite” the use of the term “facultative” is not adequate
since the ability to grow intracellularly during the infectious process is considered facultative while it is obligate and indispensable for
disease production as the term “facultative” is used in the context of the infectious process produced by the pathogen.

4. The term “obligate” in “obligate intracellular pathogens” is based on the incapability to grow in artiﬁcial conditions while what counts for

an infectious agent living from pathogenicity is what happens in the infected host.

2005), although they may be occasionally seen within phagocytes
when these attempt to kill them as a host defense mechanism.

Extracellular pathogens use virulence mechanisms to evade the
antimicrobial capabilities of humoral immunity and phagocytosis
thus promoting extracellular multiplication (Weiser and Nahm,
2008), in contrast with intracellular pathogens that promote the
entry into host cells including macrophages and non-professional
phagocytes such as epithelial cells (Sansonetti, 2001).

Important in the present context is that examples have been
accumulating of bacterial pathogens classically classiﬁed as extra-
cellular which promote their entry into host cells in vivo resulting
in a phase of intracellular residence which is relevant for the initi-
ation of the typical extracellular infection where diverse virulence
factors, speciﬁc to each pathogen, produce the pathology typical
of the disease (Weiser and Nahm, 2008). Examples of extracel-
lular pathogens that use an initial intracellular phase include S.
aureus (Garzoni and Kelley, 2009), S. pyogenes (Medina et al., 2003;
Cole et al., 2010), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Bergmann et al.,
2009), Bacillus anthracis (Russell et al., 2008), E. coli pathovars
[causing neonatal meningitis (NMEC) Croxen and Finlay, 2010,
enteroinvasive (EIEC; same as Shigella (Lan and Reeves, 2002)
Croxen and Finlay, 2010), adherent invasive (AIEC; Barnich et al.,
2007), and uropathogenic (UPEC; Hunstad and Justice, 2010)],
Bordetella pertussis (Saukkonen et al., 1991), and Helicobacter
pylori (Allen, 1999). In agreement with those in vivo results, the
above extracellular pathogens have been shown to replicate or
survive within cells cultured in vitro and have the capacity to sur-
vive/replicate in amoeba (Winiecka-Krusnell et al., 2002; Alsam
et al., 2006; Huws et al., 2008; Evstigneeva et al., 2009; Saeed et al.,
2009).

INTRACELLULAR PATHOGENS
Classical examples of intracellular pathogens are Brucella abor-
tus, Listeria monocytogenes, Chlamydia trachomatis, Coxiella bur-
netii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, and typical
infectious diseases caused by them include brucellosis, listerio-
sis, tuberculosis, and salmonellosis (Pamer, 2008). Intracellular
pathogenic bacteria have the ability to establish a relationship
in the susceptible host which includes a stage of intracellular
multiplication (Moulder, 1962, 1985). To establish an infection,
these pathogens have to make contact with the appropriated
type of host cell that affords suitable intracellular conditions for
growth. Classically, intracellular pathogens have been classiﬁed
as obligate or facultative (Moulder, 1985). This classiﬁcation has
been based on the presence (in facultative intracellular bacte-
ria) or absence (in obligate intracellular bacteria) of the capacity

to multiply in a cell-free environment (Suter, 1956; Moulder,
1985). This feature has been usually evaluated by the ability
to multiply in artiﬁcial bacteriological media (Moulder, 1985;
Renesto et al., 2003; Toft and Andersson, 2010), a perspective
which introduces a serious caveat in that classiﬁcation (see next
section).

Intracellular bacterial pathogens use a wide range of host cells
both professional (macrophages) and non-professional phago-
cytes like epithelial and endothelial cells and hepatocytes (Moul-
der, 1985; Pamer, 2008). After entering the target host cell, the
intracellular pathogen may follow diverse vacuolar or cytosolic
pathways (examples and references in Knodler and Celli, 2010).

As will be later discussed in detail, a central issue here is
that the intracellular stage of infection by facultative intracellular
pathogens is indispensable for the pathogenicity of these bacteria
whenever this has been investigated (reviewed in Leung and Finlay,
1991; Kaufmann, 1999; Bogdan, 2008).

Facultative and obligate intracellular pathogens are located in
the extracellular space before they enter cells and in progressing
intracellular infections the pathogen must transit from one host
cell to the next to spread the infection. Although a few intracel-
lular pathogens are capable of intercellular transmission without
an extracellular phase, most have extracellular passages when in
transit (Hybiske and Stephens, 2008). However, several facultative
intracellular pathogens have another type of extracellular life in
the host independent from the cell–cell transit (Figure 1), which
represents a particular disease stage and confers a dual intracel-
lular/extracellular lifestyle that provides those infectious agents
with survival and pathogenic advantages. The recognition of this
implies that we have to consider that “in vivo bacteria” may include
intracellular and extracellular lifestyles (Hazlett and Cirillo, 2009).
In some cases, this extracellular stage involves systemic dissemina-
tion and multiplication and may be exuberant and responsible for
the severity of the disease, as, for example, in plague (Sebbane et al.,
2005), tularemia (Parmely et al., 2009), melioidosis (Wiersinga
et al., 2006). During this second phase, diverse additional vir-
ulence factors enter into play to produce pathology speciﬁc for
each disease. One frequent complication of the extracellular phase
of infection by facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens when
it becomes serious is severe sepsis, a clinical condition with a
very high mortality rate, that represents a patient’s dysregulated
response to a severe infection (Bone et al., 1992; Stearns-Kurosawa
et al., 2010).

Diverse facultative bacterial intracellular pathogens have brieﬂy
been reported to exhibit the dual style of infectivity showing in
the host a dual biphasic intracellular/extracellular microbiological

Classiﬁcation of bacterial pathogens

PROBLEMS WITH THE CLASSICAL CLASSIFICATION OF
BACTERIAL PATHOGENS
EXTRACELLULAR IN VITRO AND IN VIVO GROWTH AND THE
CLASSIFICATION OF BACTERIAL PATHOGENS
In the life of a microbe, the intracellularity and extracellularity are
vague designations unless clearly related to the setting where it is
living. The ability of the pathogen to grow in artiﬁcial cell-free
media has been hyper-valorized as a parameter for the classiﬁca-
tion of pathogens. Isolation and identiﬁcation of bacteria in vitro
in pure culture in an artiﬁcial medium is invaluable and represents
a major historical landmark of the pioneer studies by Koch, Pas-
teur and followers. In vitro cultivation of bacteria provides several
important functions: (1) isolation and identiﬁcation of bacteria in
pure culture, (2) study of basic microbiology, (3) antibiotic sen-
sitivity testing, (4) production of antigens and vaccines. However,
it is not possible to duplicate in artiﬁcial cell-free bacteriologi-
cal media the complex environment bacteria encounter in vivo
when growing extracellularly, environment that involves much
more than nutritional needs. It is interesting that Koch (1880)
himself recognized that there are no better cultivation conditions
for pathogenic bacteria than the animal body itself. The metabolic
and other physiological parameters that bacteria require to grow
extracellularly in vivo are not the same they use to grow in vitro
as the two environments are quite diverse and impossible to ade-
quately duplicate. In vitro pathogen proteomes are different from
those present in host conditions.

Legionella are considered facultative intracellular pathogens
because they are able to grow in artiﬁcial cell-free media (Pine
et al., 1979; Toft and Andersson, 2010). However, when viewed
as pathogens, Legionella enter and replicate in host cells (Newton
et al., 2010), and there is no available data showing that they are
able to multiply extracellularly in this setting.

Some intracellular bacterial pathogens are able to replicate or
to survive in environmental niches. Residence and multiplica-
tion of bacterial pathogens at environmental niches originates a
route for transmission to human and animal hosts through water,
food, air, and vectors, and promotes interaction with free-living
protozoa (Yildiz, 2007), therefore being contributing factors for
microbial survival. However, a central issue here is that, for a
microbial pathogen, what matters is whether intra- or extracel-
lularity is in the context of the in vivo life and in association
with pathogenicity. When analyzing a bacterial pathogen as an
infectious agent that is producing disease, what is relevant is its
behavior in the host. Thus, intra- or extracellularity should be
considered in the host setting, and the ability to grow in artiﬁ-
cial cell-free media is not relevant. When living as a pathogen in
association with its host, important in microbiological terms is
whether the intracellular infectious agent, besides the phase of
intracellular growth which is behind its label, also is able to live
extracellularly in the settings of the extracellular territories of their
hosts.

THE INCONSISTENCY OF THE LABEL FACULTATIVE
INTRACELLULAR PATHOGEN
In the term “facultative intracellular pathogens” the adjective
“facultative” refers to “intracellular” to indicate that
these
infectious agents are able to replicate inside and outside cells
(Moulder, 1985). But the problem is that the use of the term

behavior. This includes, among others, L. monocytogenes (Hof
et al., 1997), Brucella sp. (Anderson et al., 1986), Erysipelothrix
rhusiopathiae (Bender et al., 2009), Tropheryma whipplei (Ren-
esto et al., 2003), and Shigella (or E. coli pathovar EIEC; Lan and
Reeves, 2002; Croxen and Finlay, 2010). However, the extracellular
behavior of most of these pathogens has not been fully analyzed
in vivo and the relevance for pathogenicity of their extracellular
phases in the host is not yet acceptably clariﬁed.

Examples of

infectious diseases where a dual

intracellu-
lar/extracellular style of infectivity has been well studied include
infections by Yersinia pestis (Perry and Fetherston, 1997; Sebbane
et al., 2005), Francisella tularensis (Eisen et al., 2009; Parmely et al.,
2009), Burkholderia pseudomallei (Reckseidler-Zenteno et al.,
2005), Burkholderia cenocepacia (Wiersinga et al., 2006), S. enter-
ica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium; MacLennan et al.,
2008; Albaghdadi et al., 2009), Edwardsiella tarda (Wang et al.,
2005; Mohanty and Sahoo, 2007), and M. tuberculosis (Dannen-
berg Jr., 1994; Bru and Cardona, 2010). These pathogens have
the ability to produce extracellular infections as a second phase
after the initial intracellular stage (Figure 1). These infections may
include escape from its initial intracellular niche back into the gut
or gall bladder lumen as part of its infectious cycle, as in the case
of Salmonella infection, a step that is essential for dissemination
and transmission to other hosts (Knodler et al., 2010), but in the
above infections the extracellular phase may play a critical role
in the pathogenesis of the infection and may lead to the terminal
infectious episode preceding the death of the infected host.

Classiﬁcation of bacterial pathogens

“facultative” is in the context of pathogenicity since that adjec-
tive is part of the label “facultative intracellular pathogens.” And,
when living as pathogens, the facultative intracellular parasites
must have a phase of intracellular life in the host it infects, phase
which is obligate as it is required for pathogenicity and involves
speciﬁc virulent genes (reviewed in References Leung and Finlay,
1991; Bogdan, 2008; Alkhuder et al., 2010; Fuchs et al., 2012). This
has been speciﬁcally demonstrated for infectious diseases due to Y.
pestis (Oyston et al., 2000; Bliska and Casadevall, 2009), F. tularen-
sis (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Qin et al., 2009), B. pseudomallei (Pilatz
et al., 2006), E. tarda (Okuda et al., 2006), S. Typhimurium (Fields
et al., 1986; Leung and Finlay, 1991), M. tuberculosis (Kaufmann,
1993). This stage of the life cycle of these pathogens (phase A in
Figure 1) has been the preferred topic of most studies and the sub-
ject of many comprehensive reviews (Casadevall, 2008; Malik-Kale
et al., 2011).

Therefore, the use of “facultative” in the label “facultative intra-
cellular pathogens” results in a misleading title as it states that the
pathogen may or may not be intracellular during the in vivo infec-
tion. I propose the label “dual intracellular/extracellular bacterial
pathogens” to refer to infectious agents among those classically
labeled extracellular, facultative intracellular, or obligate intracel-
lular which exhibit the dual pathogenicity-associated capacity to
replicate intracellularly and extracellularly in the host during pro-
gressive in vivo infections (Figure 2). The capacity to invade and
replicate within a variety of host cells and to multiply in host
environments exploited by extracellular parasites, makes several
intracellular/extracellular pathogens capable of causing some of
the more severe human diseases (Moulder, 1962; Brubaker, 1985).
This is the case, for example, of septicemic plague (Perry and
Fetherston, 1997), tularemia (Eisen et al., 2009; Parmely et al.,
2009), and edwardsiellosis (Janda and Abbott, 1993).

THE LABEL OBLIGATE INTRACELLULAR PATHOGEN ALSO IS
INCONSISTENT
The characterization of obligate intracellular parasitism based on
the inability to grow in bacteriological media raises several prob-
lems. First, that parameter is ﬂawed by its dependency on the state
of the cultivation art (Moulder, 1985). Several bacterial pathogens
considered paradigms of obligate intracellular parasitism have
later been shown to be able to multiply in improved cell-free bac-
teriological media as in the classical example with Mycobacterium
lepraemurium (Ishaque, 1981). This is also the case, among others,
with Ehrlichia chaffeensis that was shown to undergo DNA repli-
cation and cell division in vitro when incubated in plasma (Li and
Winslow, 2003), and with T. whipplei (Renesto et al., 2003) and C.
burnetii (Omsland et al., 2009) that exhibits signiﬁcant growth
in new complex bacteriological media. Moreover, as discussed
above, bacteriological media provide artiﬁcial conditions which
do not adequately allow the assessment the pathogen’s ability to
grow in a cell-free mode in natural settings like the host extra-
cellular territories. The ability to grow in vitro outside host cells
suggests the possibility of intracellular pathogens having a phase
of extracellular life with pathogenic implications in the infected
host, but the inability to grow extracellularly in vitro is not proof
that extracellular multiplication is not occurring in the host as
this has not been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, in some
intracellular pathogens like T. whipleii, the presence of intact cells
promotes extracellular bacterial growth when co-cultured in vitro

FIGURE 2 | The three modes of microbial infection. In situation 1 (blue
arrows) only the extracellular phase of infection occurs. I label the bacteria
following this infectious process “exclusive extracellular pathogens.”
In situation 2 (red arrows) extracellular replication occurs after a phase of
intracellular multiplication. I label these infectious agents “dual
intracellular/extracellular pathogens.” In some infections the extracellular
phase may originate new phases of intracellular replication, as is the case
of pulmonary tuberculosis (Dannenberg Jr., 1994; see main text).
In situation 3 (green arrows) only the intracellular phase occurs. I label
these infectious agents “exclusive intracellular pathogens.” The outcome of
the infections will depend on the virulence of the pathogen and on the
immune competence of the host.

Box 2 Important questions for future research.

Further in vivo research is needed to clarify the following points:

1. What is the actual relevance of the occurrence of pathogenicity-associated intracellular life among the classically labeled extracellular

pathogens?

2. What is the actual relevance of the occurrence of extracellular infective life of classically labeled facultative intracellular pathogens?
How important for pathogenesis are the incomplete descriptions of extracellular residence/replication of some facultative intracellular
pathogens, including L. monocytogenes, Brucella sp., E. rhusiopathiae, T. whipplei and Shigella (or E. coli pathovar EIEC)?

3. What is the actual relevance of the occurrence of extracellular infective life of classically labeled obligate intracellular pathogens? Is it
possible to have in vivo extracellular replication in infections by obligate intracellular parasites that have so far been impossible to grow
in vitro in cell-free media?

Classiﬁcation of bacterial pathogens

FIGURE 3 | The group of bacterial pathogens with a dual
intracellular/extracellular life style in the host is widespread and
expanding. Scheme showing the advanced perspective that the
group enclosing intracellular/extracellular bacterial pathogens is
continuously enlarging. With advances in the research in the ﬁeld,
traditionally labeled extracellular bacterial pathogens (left) have been
transferred to the group of dual intracellular/extracellular pathogens
(center) through the demonstration that they use to their advantage
the virulence-associated ability to grow intracellularly in the host. On
the other hand, traditionally labeled obligate intracellular pathogens
(right) have been found to be capable of cell-free replication in vitro

although the implications for pathogenicity in vivo of this attribute
have not been assessed. Perspectives similar to those in this scheme
have previously been hypothesized in relation to the traditionally
labeled obligate intracellular or extracellular parasites by Moulder
(1985) and Casadevall (2008), respectively. Emerging evidence
discussed in this review has strengthened the view of a trend toward
the progressive enlargement of the group of intracellular/extracellular
bacterial pathogens at the expenses of extracellular and obligate
intracellular infectious agents and by discovering new cases of
intracellular/extracellular bacteria among facultative intracellular
pathogens.

with cells (La Scola et al., 2001). The presence of large aggregates
of bacteria including dividing cells in these culture supernatants
suggested that T. whipplei may not be a strictly intracellular bac-
terium (La Scola et al., 2001) and, indeed, this pathogen was latter
able to grow axenically (Renesto et al., 2003). This promotion
of in vitro extracellular growth of T. whipplei by the presence of
intact host cells indicates that extracellular multiplication in the
host may occur even with pathogens that have not been cultivated
in cell-free media. However, the likely pathogenetic implications of
the capacity of obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens to repli-
cate in bacteriological media have not been thoroughly evaluated
(Box 2).

CONCLUSION
In the life of a microbe, intracellularity and extracellularity are
vague designations unless clearly related to the setting where it is
living. For a microbial pathogen when living as a pathogen, what

matters is whether intra- or extracellularity is in the context of
the in vivo life and in association with virulence not the ability to
survive/replicate in the environment or artiﬁcial cell-free media.
In my opinion, a major point is that the characterization of
bacteria as pathogenic agents should be based on the infective
lifestyles they exhibit in infected hosts or in adequate experi-
mental hosts as these are the relevant environments to evalu-
ate pathogenicity. From this perspective, the classical classiﬁca-
tion of microbial pathogens in extracellular, facultative intra-
cellular, and obligate intracellular is inadequate and I pro-
pose, according to their lifestyles in the host, to label these
groups as exclusive extracellular, dual intracellular/extracellular,
and exclusive intracellular pathogens, respectively (Figure 2).
The distribution of bacterial pathogens following this classiﬁ-
cation is not a static process since it will be dependent on the
likely discovery of new cases of dual intracellular/extracellular
pathogens.

Classiﬁcation of bacterial pathogens

The ability for a dual life style with pathogenic implications
of bacterial infectious agents in the host appears as an important
trait which has been underappreciated and not thoroughly ana-
lyzed. Information in this topic is largely incomplete creating an
important area of ignorance that urges for further research (see
Box 2) which likely will be an expanding process revealing new
cases of dual intra/extracellular pathogens among the three types
of bacterial parasites (Figure 3).

Precise classiﬁcation of infectious agents in regards to their
infective lifestyles in the host and understanding the immunolog-
ical and pathogenic implications of those lifestyles, are required
because clear concepts are essential to direct fruitful research and
to deﬁne prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Research on
microbial and host factors that contribute to the success of the

pathogens with a dual lifestyle may lead to novel strategies for
prevention and treatment.
