Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized by abnormal deposition of α-synuclein aggregates 
in many regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Accumulating evidence suggests that the α-synuclein pathology 
initiates in a few discrete regions and spreads to larger areas in the nervous system. Recent pathological studies of PD patients have 
raised the possibility that the enteric nervous system is one of the initial sites of α-synuclein aggregation and propagation. Here, we 
evaluated the induction and propagation of α-synuclein aggregates in the enteric nervous system of the A53T α-synuclein transgenic 
mice after injection of human brain tissue extracts into the gastric walls of the mice. Western analysis of the brain extracts showed 
that the DLB extract contained detergent-stable α-synuclein aggregates, but the normal brain extract did not. Injection of the 
DLB extract resulted in an increased deposition of α-synuclein in the myenteric neurons, in which α-synuclein formed punctate 
aggregates over time up to 4 months. In these mice, inflammatory responses were increased transiently at early time points. None of 
these changes were observed in the A53T mice injected with saline or the normal brain extract, nor were these found in the wild type 
mice injected with the DLB extract. These results demonstrate that pathological α-synuclein aggregates present in the brain of DLB 
patient can induce the aggregation of endogenous α-synuclein in the myenteric neurons in A53T mice, suggesting the transmission 
of synucleinopathy lesions in the enteric nervous system.

symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, 
gait disorder, and tremor [1]. However, non-motor symptoms, 
such as hyposmia, gastrointestinal abnormalities, and autonomic 
dysfunction are increasingly accepted as integral part of PD 
clinical manifestations and often precede the classical motor 
symptoms [2]. Pathologically, selective neurodegeneration and the 
occurrence of Lewy bodies (LB) in central and peripheral nervous 
systems are observed in PD at autopsy [3]. The neuronal protein 
α-synuclein aggregates are major LB component. Mutations

in α-synuclein gene have been linked to monogenic forms of 
familial PD [4-8]. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies 
suggested that sporadic PD is also associated with the genetic 
variations in α-synuclein gene [9]. 
Recent neuropathological studies indicate that α-synuclein 
pathology progresses in a highly specific and predictable pattern 
in the central nervous system (CNS). Braak and colleagues have 
divided this progressive pattern into six stages, spreading from 
the lower brain stem and the olfactory bulb to the limbic system, 
and finally, to several regions of the neocortex [10, 11]. Although 
the precise sequence of progression is under debate, it is accepted 
that α-synuclein pathology spreads from a few discrete regions to 
larger areas in the brain. An increasing body of evidence suggests 
that a direct cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein aggregates is the 
underlying mechanism for the pathological spreading [12, 13]. 
α-synuclein pathology in PD is not limited to the brain but is also 
found in other nervous systems including sympathetic gang lia, the 
enteric nervous system (ENS), cardiac and pelvic plexuses, skin, 
etc. [14]. Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is a common fea ture in PD, 
and deposition of α-synuclein in the ENS of PD pa tients has been 
reported in the myenteric and submucosal plexu ses of GI tracts 
[15-17]. α-synuclein containing aggregates were also observed in 
the myenteric plexus of the normal aging rats [18]. α-synuclein 
aggregates were detected in the ENS prior to the changes in the 
CNS in a transgenic mouse model [19]. These previous studies have 
raised the possibility that the α-synuclein pathology could be ini-
tiated from the ENS, and propagate to the CNS through the vagus 
nerve [10]. 
Here, we determined whether pathogenic α-synuclein aggregates 
in Lewy body disease could induce α-synuclein pathology in the 
ENS of a mouse model. Brain extracts from a DLB patient and a 
normal control subject were injected into the gastric walls of α-sy-
nu clein A53T transgenic or C57BL6 control mice, and the α-synu-
clein pathology and inflammatory responses were assessed. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials
The primary antibodies used are as follows: α-synuclein 
monoclonal antibody (Syn-1; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, 
USA), human α-synuclein specific monoclonal antibody 274 from 
our laboratory [20], anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 
antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and anti-MHC-II 
antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). 

Human brain tissues
The human brain tissues were from the South Australia Brain Bank. 

The normal control brain tissue is from a 72 year old male with 30 
hours postmortem delay and had no neurofibrillary tangles, pla ques, 
or Lewy body pathology. DLB patient brain tissue was from a 77 year 
old male with 19 hours postmortem delay who had diffuse Lewy 
body pathology. The pathological stains were performed by the 
Bielschowsky silver and specific immuno-diagnostic stains.

Mouse strains
C57BL6 and A53T tg [B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-SNCA*A53T)1Sud/J] mice 
were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, 
USA). Housing and breeding of animals were performed at the animal 
care facility of Konkuk University. The experiments were approved 
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commi ttee of Konkuk 
University (IACUC #KU11023).

Preparation of brain extracts
The brain homogenates from normal and DLB patient brains 
were obtained by sonicating unfrozen temporal cortices in PBS with 
pro tease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The pro tein 
concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, 
IL, USA).

Western blotting
The procedure for western blotting is described elsewhere [21]. 
Chemiluminescence detection was performed using the FUJIFILM 
Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-3000 and Multi Gauge (v3.0) 
software (FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan).

Stomach injection experiments
Ten to twelve weeks old male and female mice were anesthetized 
by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Zoletil50 (75 mg/kg; Virbac, 
Carros cedex, France), rompun (5 mg/kg; Bayer AG, Leverkusen, 
Germany), and saline mixture (1 : 1 : 18). Using the clean forceps 
and scissors, the stomach cavity was opened and 100 μg brain ex-
tract proteins was injected using the syringe into the several places 
of body area in the stomach wall, being careful not to puncture the 
stomach wall. After suturing, mice were maintained as usual. The 
num ber of animals used are described below: saline 1month (3), 
nor mal brain extract 1month (4), DLB extract 1month (5), saline 
2 months (4), normal brain extract 2 months (5), DLB extract 2 
months (5), saline 3months (2), normal brain extract 3 months (2), 
DLB extract 3 months (4), saline 4 months (4), normal brain ex-
tract 4 months (2), and DLB extract 4 months (6). 

Tissue preparation
Mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection of Zoletil50 (75 mg/
kg), rompun (5 mg/kg), and saline mixture (1 : 1 : 18). The mice

were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% 
paraformaldehyde (PFA). Stomach, brain, and spinal cord were 
re moved and postfixed and stored for further analyses. Stomach 
was cut and laid flat on the sponge before post-fixing with 4% pa-
ra formaldehyde overnight. Fixed stomach tissue was then rinsed 
in DMSO three times 5 minute each to ease the separation of 
sto mach wall layers. It was rinsed in PBS several times to remove 
DMSO. Using the thin forceps, mucosa, submucosa, muscularis 
ex terna layers were carefully removed to expose myenteric plexus.

Whole-mount immunohistochemistry
The prepared stomach tissue was immunostained for further 
analy sis. After washing 3 times in PBST (PBS/0.2% Triton X-100), 
the tissue was blocked using Vector M.O.M. kit (Vector Labs, 
Burlingame, CA, USA) for 1 hour at RT. The primary antibodies 
were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated for 48 hours at 4oC 
with slow rotation. After washing 3 times in PBST, fluorescence 
dye (Cy2-, Rhodamine Red X-) conjugated secondary antibodies 
were added and incubated for 1 hour at RT. After washing 3 times 
in PBST, the nuclei were stained with TOPRO-3 (Invitrogen, 
Carls bad, CA) for 10 min at RT and washed again in PBST. The 
stained tissue was mounted on slide using Antifade reagent from 
Invitrogen.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were blind-coded and repeated three-to-
four times. The values in the figures are expressed as the mean ± 
SEM. Differences were considered significant if p values were < 
0.05. The graphs were drawn with Prism 5 software (Graphpad 
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). For determination of statistical 
significance, values were compared by one-way ANOVA with 
Bonferroni’s post-test using InStat (version 3.05) software 
(Graphpad Software Inc.).

RESULTS

α-synuclein aggregates in the brain extract of a DLB patient 
α-synuclein in the brain extracts from the normal subject and a 
DLB patient were compared by Western blotting (Fig. 1). The amount 
of monomer (arrow) was not different between the normal and 
DLB extracts. However, higher levels of α-synuclein aggregates 
were detected in the DLB brain extract than in the normal extract. 
Immunohistochemical analyses of temporal cortex of opposite 
hemisphere revealed comparable background α-synuclein staining 
in both cases, but only the DLB patient contained LBs (data not 
shown). We have used these extracts in the following experiments 
to determine possible interactions of exogenous α-synuclein with

aggregates.

Deposition  of α-synuclein  in  the  myenteric  plexus  of 
injected A53T mice
Brain extracts were injected into the stomach walls of the A53T 
heterozygous tg mice, and the α-synuclein deposition was exami-
ned in the enteric nervous system within the stomach tissues1 to 
4 months after the injection (Fig. 2). After 30 days of injection, mostly 
diffused α-synuclein immunoreactivity was more prominent in the 
myenteric plexus neurons of the DLB extract-injected mice than 
in those of saline-injected or the normal extract-injected mice 
(Fig. 2A; enlarged). At 60 days, α-synuclein staining in the DLB 
extract-injected mice showed small punctates in some neurons 
of the myenteric plexus (Fig. 2B enlarged; arrows), however, these 
structures were not observed in the saline- or normal extract-
injected mice. At 90 days, α-synuclein punctates grew larger in 
DLB extract-injected mice (Fig. 2C enlarged; arrows). Finally, 
after 4 months of injection, the number of the myenteric plexus 
neurons with α-synuclein punctates were increased, and the 
size of individual punctates became larger (Fig. 2D). Some of 
the saline- and the normal extract-injected mice started to show 
small punctates after 4 months. The size and prevalence of these 
structures were similar to those observed in the DLB-injected mice 
at 30 days. In contrast to the results in α-synuclein tg mice, wild 
type C57BL6 mice injected with the DLB extract did not show the 
punctate α-synuclein patterns even after 4 months (Fig. 5 upper 
panel). Therefore, the α-synuclein aggregates found in the A53T 
tg mice injected with the DLB extract are the result of the induced 
aggregation of neuronal α-synuclein and not the result of simple 
deposition of the exogenously injected proteins. The graph in Fig. 
3 summarizes the changes in the patterns of α-synuclein staining

α-Synuclein Transmission in the ENS

DISCUSSION

The discovery of abnormal deposition of α-synuclein in the ENS 
of PD patients early in the disease [15-17] has raised the spe cu-
la tion that the ENS might be an initiation site for the α-synuclein 
pa tho logy, which then propagates to the CNS possibly via the va-
gus nerve. Supporting this, in a transgenic mouse model, accumu-
lation of α-synuclein aggregates in the ENS precedes the changes 
in the CNS [19]. In the present study, we have shown that injection 
of the total brain extract of a DLB patient into the gastric walls of 
α-synuclein A53T transgenic mice resulted in an accumulation of 
α-synuclein aggregates in the enteric neurons. In contrast, injec-
tion of control brain extract failed to produce the aggregates. The 
spreading of aggregates was much more robust in the transgenic 
mice than in non-transgenic control mice, suggesting the inter ac-
tion between the exogenous and neuronal endogenous α-synu-
clein proteins. Our results suggest that once α-synuclein aggregates 
are formed in some neurons in the GI system, they can spread to 
a larger neuronal population in the ENS, thereby increasing the 
chan ce to propagate the aggregates to the CNS. 
The GI system is one of the most susceptible systems to envi ron-
mental stresses in the body as it is in direct contact with environ-
men tal agents. Recently, intragastric administration of rotenone 
in mice resulted in a progressive deposition of α-synuclein in both 
the ENS and the CNS neurons that are affected by PD, such as 
the neurons in the myenteric plexus, the dorsal motor nucleus of 
vagus (DMV), the spinal cord, and the SN [22]. Injection of pro-
teasome inhibitors to the ventral wall of the stomach also led to 
the formation of α-synuclein-immunopositive aggregates in the 
DMV in rats [23]. These studies suggested that environmental 
stresses to the GI system could lead to the α-synuclein pathology 
in the CNS. The mechanism by which environmental agents in-
du ce α-synuclein aggregation is unknown. However, a recent 
study showed that α-synuclein expression in the ENS could be 
up regulated by agents that cause depolarization and increase the 
levels of cyclic AMP [24]. 
We and several other groups have previously shown that a 
small amount of α-synuclein could be secreted from neuronal 
cells via exocytosis [13]. A significant portion of the released 
α-sy nu clein is in oligomeric states [25, 26]. After the release, the 
extra cellular α-synuclein can be internalized into neighboring 
neu rons, astrocytes, and microglia via endocytosis [27, 28]. These 
findings inspired the studies, in which direct cell-to-cell transfer of 
α-synuclein has been demonstrated in both cell culture and animal 
models [29-32]. Transfer of α-synuclein resulted in the formation 
of LB-like inclusion bodies and neurodegeneration [29]. The 
direct cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein might be the underlying

from slight, diffused staining (scale 0) to larger aggregates (scale 3) 
in the DLB extract-injected mice. Only the mice injected with the 
DLB extract showed an increase in α-synuclein aggregates over 
time. These results suggest that exogenous α-synuclein aggregates 
could induce the aggregation of the endogenous protein in the 
myenteric neurons, thereby propagating synucleinopathy lesions 
within the enteric nervous system.

Changes in the inflammatory responses in the DLB extract-
injected A53T mice
To determine if inflammatory responses are related to the 
changes in the α-synuclein aggregation, activation of macrophage 
was evaluated by the immunostaining for major histocompatibility 
complex class 2 (MHCII) (Fig. 4). There was slight increase in 
the MHCII staining in the DLB extract-injected mice at 30 days 
(Fig. 4A). MHCII expression increased further at 60 days in the 
DLB extract-injected mice (Fig. 4B). However, 90 and 120 days 
after injection, the expression levels for MHCII dropped to the 
levels of saline and normal extract controls (Fig. 4C, D). There 
were little changes in the MHCII immunoreactivity in the saline 
and normal extract-injected mice (Fig. 4) and in wild-type mice 
injected with the DLB extract (Fig. 5 lower panel) during the entire 
period of the experiment. There were no significant changes in 
glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity, suggesting 
little effect on enteric astrocytes (Fig. 4). This result shows that the 
inflammatory responses precede the changes in the α-synuclein 
aggregation and may have an important role in the transmission of 
synucleinopathies.

current study. 
Another interesting finding from our experiments was the 
transient activation of macrophages at earlier time points 
(1~2 months). Chronic inflammation is a critical component 

in the progression of PD and might be an inducer of protein 
aggregation [33]. We have previously shown that α-synuclein can 
be directly transferred from neurons to astroglia, and as a result, 
pro-inflammatory responses were induced [34]. Microglia and 
macrophages were also activated by ectopically administered

α-synuclein proteins [35, 36]. Microglial activation was detected 
in early stages of PD, suggesting that the neuroinflammatory 
responses are significant factors in the disease progression [37]. 
In the current study, we did not detect any changes in astroglia in 
the ENS after injection of the DLB extract. However, macrophage 
activation was observed transiently prior to accumulation of 
α-synuclein aggregates. These results suggest that inflammatory 
responses in the GI tissues may contribute to the initiation 
of α-synuclein aggregation in the ENS and perhaps to the 
propagation of aggregates within the ENS. 
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that when exogenously 
introduced, pathological α-synuclein aggregates present in the 
brain of DLB patient can induce the aggregation of endogenous 
α-synuclein in the ENS neurons. These results would be an 
important foundation for future research to verify the progressive 
transmission of α-synuclein pathology from the ENS to the CNS 
in PD and related disorders.
