Polyamines (PAs) are ubiquitous substances considered to be bioregulators of numerous
cell functions; they take part in cell growth, division, and differentiation. These biogenic
amines are also involved in tissue repair and in intracellular signaling; in fact, because
of their polycationic character, they interact to a large extent with membrane phospho-
lipids and may play an important role in the regulation of membrane-linked enzymes. The
intracellular polyamine content derives from the simultaneous regulation of the synthesis,
catabolism, uptake, and elimination of the polyamines; furthermore, PAs are present in
all cell types at different concentrations, but the highest levels are found in rapid-turnover
tissues. In addition to spermidine, spermine, and putrescine, also agmatine (AGM), deriv-
ing from arginine and identiﬁed in mammals in the 1990s, is a polyamine and several
studies have reported its potentially positive role in the production of secretagogues, and
in neuronal, vascular, metabolic, and therapeutic functions. Because of the low arginine
decarboxylase (ADC) activity in mammalians, the amounts of AGM found in their tissues
can be only minimally ascribed to an endogenous de novo synthesis by ADC, while a sub-
stantial quantity of AGM may be of dietary origin. Several food products contain only small
amounts of polyamines, while higher concentrations can be found in fermented foods. PAs
could also be considered as indicators of freshness in ﬁsh and meat products; as these
moieties are produced during food storage, it would seem to conﬁrm the main role of
microorganisms in their synthesis. In particular, high levels of AGM are present in alcoholic
beverages, such as wine, beer, sake, which would seem to conﬁrm the role of yeasts in
AGM production. Although many biological functions have been attributed to polyamines,
high levels of these compounds in foodstuffs can have toxicological effects; however, no
safe level for the intake of polyamines in a diet has yet been established. In this paper the
presence of AGM in different foodstuffs is discussed, also taking into account the various
factors affecting its presence and concentration.

INTRODUCTION
Biogenic amines (BAs) are ubiquitous substances occurring in
every living cell. They play different roles in cellular metabolism: in
particular, polyamines (PAs), such as agmatine (AGM), putrescine
(PUT), spermine (SPM), and spermidine (SPD) are considered
to be bioregulators of numerous cell functions, being involved in
the process of cell growth, division, and differentiation (Galgano
et al., 2003). These BAs are also involved in tissue repair and in
intracellular signaling; in fact, because of their polycationic char-
acter, they interact to a large extent with membrane phospholipids
and may play an important role in the regulation of membrane-
linked enzymes. The intracellular polyamine content derives from
the simultaneous regulation of the synthesis, catabolism, uptake,
and elimination of the polyamines; furthermore, PAs are present
in all cell types at different concentrations, but the highest lev-
els are found in rapid-turnover tissues (Moinard et al., 2005).
In mammals their diet also provides a daily supply of PAs and
the distribution of the different PAs varies according to the food
type. The highest amounts are present in fermented foods and
beverages, especially in protein-rich foods, e.g., ﬁsh and ﬁsh prod-
ucts, meat and meat products, eggs, cheeses, fermented vegetables,

fruits, nuts, chocolate, soybean products, and wine (Silla Santos,
1996). Moreover, also processing and additives can inﬂuence BA
formation in foods: for example, BAs are heat stable compounds
and their level is not signiﬁcantly reduced by high temperature
treatment (Naila et al., 2010).

Biogenic amines in foods are generated either as the result
of endogenous amino acid decarboxylase activity in raw food
materials or by the growth of decarboxylase-positive microorgan-
isms under conditions favorable to enzyme activity (Halász et al.,
1999a). As the microbial spoilage of food may be accompanied by
the increased production of decarboxylases, the presence of BAs
might serve as a useful indicator of food spoilage (Silla Santos,
1996).

Although many biological functions have been attributed to
PAs, high levels of these compounds in foodstuffs can have toxico-
logical effects. In fact, even if individually they are not considered
toxic, PAs can enhance the effects of histamine (HIS) and tyramine
(TYR) by interacting with the aminooxidases and interfering with
detoxifying mechanisms. Similarly, other compounds, like alcohol
and acetaldehyde, can enhance the toxic potential of BAs, since
they promote the transportation of these moieties through the

intestinal wall. For these reasons, it is difﬁcult to establish the safety
threshold of BAs in a given product, because their toxicity does not
depend merely on their presence (type and level), but also on indi-
vidual detoxiﬁcation mechanisms and on the occurrence of other
compounds affecting their activity (EFSA Panel on Biological
Hazards (BIOHAZ), 2011; Ruiz-Capillas and Jiménez-Colmenero,
2004).

ORIGIN OF AGMATINE
The presence of AGM in plants, bacteria, and invertebrates has
been known for a long time, but its occurrence in mammals was
reported for the ﬁrst time only in the 1990s and since then grow-
ing attention has been focused on this polyamine (Moinard et al.,
2005).

AGM is produced from l-arginine by arginine decarboxylase
(ADC) and is a PUT precursor, one of the main BAs associ-
ated with microbial food spoilage. PUT can originate from argi-
nine via ornithine decarboxylase, or another pathway is by AGM
deamination involving three enzymes (AGM deiminase, PUT
carbamoyltransferase, and carbamate). This pathway has been
demonstrated only in a few microorganisms, such as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa PAO1, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC11700, Bacillus cereus
ATCC14579, and Lactobacillus hilgardii X1B (Arena and Manca de
Nadra, 2001; EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ), 2011;
Landete et al., 2008). In particular, the amino-biogenic activity
of the latter microorganism has been widely demonstrated, espe-
cially with regards to the production of AGM and PUT at high
concentrations (EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ),
2011; Landete et al., 2008).

The presence of pyridoxal, Mg2+

can enhance ADC
activity as well as that of other amino decarboxylases, but agma-
tine deiminase does not seem to be affected by the presence of
these cofactors; conversely, arginine, glucose, and fructose have
been shown to exert an inhibitory effect on AGM deamination,
whereas high levels of AGM can enhance the production of PUT
(Arena and Manca de Nadra, 2001; EFSA Panel on Biological
Hazards (BIOHAZ), 2011; Landete et al., 2008). Landete et al.
(2008) have reported a positive correlation between the presence
of succinate, SPM and SPD, and PUT production in P. aeruginosa
PAO1. Conversely, in the case of E. faecalis ATCC11700, B. cereus
ATCC14579, and L. hilgardii X1B succinate did not have any effect,
while SPD and SPM always contributed to the reduction of AGM
deamination.

, and Mn2+

The ability of bacteria to produce BAs is widely documented,
whereas there are few reports regarding the formation of BAs by
yeasts, even if considerable quantities of AGM and other BAs have
been found in wines and other alcoholic beverages (Izquierdo-
Pulido et al., 1996; Glória et al., 1998; Galgano et al., 2003, 2011).
Caruso et al. (2002) have reported the ability of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae to produce ethanolamine and AGM in inoculated grape
must; also other yeast strains isolated from grapes and wines,
belonging to the species Candida stellata, Kloeckera apiculata,
Metschnikowia pulcherrima, and Brettanomyces bruxellensis, are
thought to be capable of producing AGM. In Photobacterium phos-
phoreum the presence of AGM and PUT has been reported to
inﬂuence the occurrence of histamine (HIS), consequently inhibit-
ing histidine decarboxylase activity (Karovicová and Kohajdová,
2005).

ROLE OF AGMATINE
Moinard et al. (2005) have reported that AGM concentrations
in the brain have been found to be comparable to that of typ-
ical neurotransmitters, thus suggesting that AGM might be a
neurotransmitter.

A variety of effects have been demonstrated in response to
AGM in vivo and in vitro, but the biological signiﬁcance of these
effects is still under debate, because the concentrations at which
the effects were induced were much higher than those present
in blood and tissues (Molderings et al., 2002). However, AGM
is known to have secretagogue properties, such as the modula-
tion of insulin release and glucose metabolism, the stimulation of
adrenaline, and noradrenaline secretion. AGM antagonizes some
hyperalgesic states and enhances the dose-related analgesic effect
of morphine (Moinard et al., 2005; Wade et al., 2008).

AGM appears to inﬂuence appetite regulation. The administra-
tion of a high dose of AGM to satiated rats triggered an increase
in their caloric intake and their carbohydrate preferences, whereas
AGM does not modulate caloric intake in hungry rats (Prasad and
Prasad, 1996). AGM also plays an important role in polyamines
homeostasis: by inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase, AGM inhibits
smooth muscle proliferation (Moinard et al., 2005).

AGM is recognized as an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, an
enzyme that, starting from arginine, catalyzes the production of
nitric oxide (NO), an intercellular messenger implicated in the
regulation of various physiological functions in central neuro-
transmission. It has been suggested that NO may be involved in
the mechanism of anxiety, therefore NO inhibitors, such as AGM,
may be a potential tool for the treatment of anxiety (Uzbay and
Lal, 2002), even though Krass et al. (2008) failed to demonstrate
the reported antidepressant and anxiolytic-like activity of AGM.
However, it is highly probable that AGM will play a role in
the therapeutic treatment of a number of different diseases. In
the treatment of cancer, it has been established that AGM has a
antiproliferative effect due to its suppression of polyamine syn-
thesis and cellular polyamine uptake through the induction of
antizyme (Agostinelli et al., 2010).

It has also been suggested that AGM could play an important
role in the control of ureagenesis, representing a signiﬁcant contri-
bution to the therapeutic removal of waste toxic nitrogen from the
body. Moreover, AGM could be useful in the treatment of sepsis,
because its administration to endotoxemic rats has been shown to
prevent the decrease in blood pressure and renal function usually
associated with sepsis (Moinard et al., 2005).
AGM is also able to protect brain mitochondria against the
drop in energy capacity by the Ca2+
-dependant induction of per-
meability transition in rat brain mitochondria (Battaglia et al.,
2010). Furthermore, AGM may also be considered as a regulator of
mitochondria cell death. In addition, by increasing the expression
of antizyme, a protein that inhibits polyamine biosynthesis and
transport, AGM exhibits a regulatory effect on cell proliferation
(Agostinelli et al., 2010).

The high content of AGM in the lumen of the gastrointestinal
tract may also originate from the bacteria of the physiological gut
microﬂora, as well as from pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori.
After oral administration of radiolabeled AGM to rats in vivo,
radioactivity was retrieved in all organs investigated, as well as
in blood and urine indicating that AGM is absorbed from the

stomach and the gut by means of an energy-dependent trans-
port mechanism and distributed to the organs via the blood
stream. Moreover, the accumulation of radioactivity in organs and
distal gut luminal content decreases with the administration of
increasing doses of PUT (Molderings et al., 2002).

Because of the low ADC activity in mammalians, only a fraction
of AGM in the tissues of the organism can be due to endogenous
de novo synthesis by ADC, while a substantial portion can be of
dietary origin (Molderings et al., 2002).

and meat products, as they are produced during food storage, thus
conﬁrming the main role of microorganisms in their synthesis. In
particular, AGM is present at high levels in alcoholic beverages,
such as wine, beer, and especially in sake (114 mg/L; Okamoto
et al., 1997), while low levels have been found in fermented
non-alcoholic beverages, such as Turkish shalgam (Özdestan and
Üren, 2010a). This fact could conﬁrm the role of yeasts in AGM
production.

In Table 1 is summarized the AGM mean content in several

Agmatine in fermented foods

amines in wines depends on several factors, such as winemaking
processes, time and storage conditions, raw material quality, and
microbial contamination during winery operations. Moreover,
some amines are normal constituents of grapes, and their level
may vary with grape variety and degree of ripening, as well as with
soil type and composition. Therefore, geographical characteriza-
tion based on the BA content has also been proposed as a criterion
to discriminate several types of wines from different countries or
regions (Galgano et al., 2009, 2011). BAs usually investigated in
wines are cadaverine (CAD), HIS, 2-phenylethylamine (2-PHE),
PUT and tyramine (TYR); AGM, and ethanolamine can be abun-
dant in wines, but they are rarely investigated. Low amounts of
BA, as normal constituents of the raw materials, can be released
in must from grapes during the winemaking process, and the BA
concentration may increase as a consequence of alcoholic fermen-
tation, yeast autolysis, malolactic fermentation, and wine aging,
red wines usually having a richer amine content than white wines.
Generally PUT and AGM can contribute signiﬁcantly to the total
amine content in alcoholic beverages, while CAD, SPM, and SPD
are rare (Galgano et al., 2003, 2009, 2011). In particular, PUT is
the most abundant BA in wine, while AGM is the most prevalent
in beer (Alberto et al., 2007).

For AGM, the concentration has been reported to vary from not
detected to 22 mg/L in red wines and from not detected to 6.5 mg/L
in white wines, while PUT has been found in red wines at con-
centrations ranging from 0.6 to 21 mg/L and from not detected
to 9 mg/L in white wines (Galgano et al., 2009). SPD and SPM
originate from PUT, which derives from AGM; the latter is gener-
ally recognized as an intermediate in the PUT formation pathway,
starting from arginine, the most abundant amino acid in grape.
PUT can also derive from decarboxylation of ornithine. However,
PUT levels increase during fermentation from must to alcoholic, to
malolactic fermentation, thus supporting the hypothesis that the
principal biosynthetic pathway for PUT formation is via arginine-
AGM rather than via ornithine (Galgano et al., 2009). Moreover,
arginine, from which AGM derives, is present in must at concen-
trations higher than those found in the ﬁnished wine (Galgano
et al., 2009). In addition, wines with a low PUT content have been
shown to possess a high level of AGM and total polyphenols and
vice versa (Galgano et al., 2011). The phenolic compounds seem
to be a natural way of reducing PUT formation in wine, because
these moieties can protect the cells against oxidative stress (Alberto
et al., 2007; Rodríguez et al., 2009).

BEER
PAs are natural beer constituents and are present in malt and yeast
at higher concentrations then in hops (De Borba and Rohrer, 2007;
Sohrabvandi et al., 2012), while TYR, HIS, and CAD are consid-
ered to be indicators of microbial contamination during brewing
(Izquierdo-Pulido et al., 1996). In several beers AGM is the most
abundant amine with concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 42 mg/L
(Izquierdo-Pulido et al., 1996; Kvasnicka and Voldrich, 2006; De
Borba and Rohrer, 2007). Barley variety, malting technology, and
fermentation conditions can inﬂuence the BA content in beer both
qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, during wort process-
ing, signiﬁcant increases of AGM, and PUT have been observed,
together with the decrease of SPD and SPM (Halász et al., 1999a).

COFFEE
The proﬁle and levels of BAs in green and roasted coffee are differ-
ent; in particular, the degree of roasting signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the
amine proﬁle and levels. AGM has been detected in coffee roasted
at a high temperature for a long time. In fact, extensive roast-
ing (12 min at 300˚C) contributes to AGM formation (1.2 mg/kg)
by decarboxylation of arginine, which is present in green coffee
at levels ranging from 2 to 5 g/100 g. Conversely, AGM was not
found in American coffee, which was roasted for 6 min at 300˚C.
Furthermore, PUT is the most abundant amine in green coffee
(10 mg/kg), while it is not present in roasted coffee (Cirilo et al.,
2003). Also the processing of instant coffee can inﬂuence both the
type and level of BAs; instant coffee contains low levels of AGM
(0.4 mg/kg), while the most abundant BA is serotonin, followed by
CAD, TYR, and SPD (Leite da Silveira et al., 2007).

CEREALS AND VEGETABLES
In cereal foods, in particular in ﬂour and bread samples, PUT is
reported to be the most abundant BA, at even higher levels than
40 mg/kg, while AGM has been found only in cereal derivates, in
particular in different types of bread samples, at concentrations
ranging from 3 to 5 mg/kg of dry matter (Farkas and Hajós, 1998).
AGM is also a natural constituent of the seedlings of the winged
bean, while is not found in the common bean nor in soybean (Mor-
ris, 2003). Since several varieties of molds, yeasts, and lactic acid
bacteria are involved in the fermentation processes occurring in
the production of several soybean products, and as the substrate
is very rich in proteins, the formation of various amines might
be expected during fermentation. Several studies have highlighted
that BAs in fermented soybean products are most probably formed
by the lactic microﬂora that remains active during fermentation
(Kirschbaum et al., 2000). Among many fermented foods that
have been consumed for thousands of years in Asian countries,
soy sauce, and miso are the most important, and they are obtained
by the fermentation of soybean with or without the addition of
rice and wheat (in the case of soy sauce) or rice and barley (in the
case of miso), using a mix of molds, yeasts, and lactic acid bacteria.
In these products AGM has rarely been detected, whereas PUT is
one of the most abundant amines that can be found (Kirschbaum
et al., 2000). Conversely, in Doenjang, a traditional Korean soy-
bean paste produced by the fermentation of naturally occurring
bacteria and fungi, the presence of AGM was reported, in con-
centrations ranging from not detected to over 5500 mg/kg (Shukla
et al., 2010).

Recently Özdestan et al. (2011) have investigated the BA content
in Kumru, a traditional Turkish fermented cereal food produced
from chickpeas. In this case not detectable amounts of AGM were
found in the product, while other BAs, such as PUT, CAD, SPD,
SPM, and HIS were present in all samples.

Fermentation temperature, salt concentration, and starter
selection have a signiﬁcant effect on BA production in sauerkraut
(fermented cabbage). In particular, the AGM level seems to be
dependent on the inoculum concentration of Lactobacillus curva-
tus. In sauerkraut brine,AGM was found to be the prevalent amine,
reaching a maximum value of 12 mg/L (Halász et al., 1999b). Con-
versely, other authors have reported that lactic fermented cabbage
juices do not contain AGM, while PUT, estimated at levels of up

Agmatine in fermented foods

to 360 mg/L, is the most abundant amine, with assessed levels up
to 360 mg/L; Kirschbaum et al., 2000).

FISH AND FISH DERIVED PRODUCTS
SPM and SPD are usually the main PAs present in fresh tissues,
at concentrations of less than 10 mg/kg. Depending on the ﬁsh
species, the free amino acids present in the tissues, and the exposure
conditions to spoilage bacteria, other amines can originate during
storage or processing, reaching harmful levels, as reported for HIS
in the case of animals belonging to the mackerel and herring fam-
ilies (Clifford and Walker, 1992; Önal, 2007). The existence of a
synergic relationship between SPM, SPD, and HIS with potentially
negative consequences on health, has been hypothesized (Silla San-
tos, 1996). Therefore, various indexes have been proposed for ﬁsh
derived products, such as the“BA index,”corresponding to the sum
of the HIS, PUT, CAD, and TYR content (Veciana-Nogues et al.,
1997), or the “quality index,” directly related to the HIS, PUT, and
CAD content and inversely related to the amounts of SPM and
SPD (Mietz and Karmas, 1997). Moreover, several authors have
indicated that AGM may be used as a freshness index, because
immediately after catch AGM can not be detected or its level is
very low, but then in various ﬁsh species the AGM content increases
progressively during chilling storage, reaching concentrations of
over 300 mg/kg after 7 days of storage (Yamanaka et al., 1987;
Paarup et al., 2002; Baker et al., 2010; Chotimarkorn, 2011). The
formation of BAs, commonly related to ﬁsh spoilage (HIS, TYR,
CAD, and AGM), was found to be signiﬁcantly higher in the ﬁrst
stage of ripening in ungutted anchovies than in gutted ones. Con-
versely, no differences have been observed regarding the content of
SPM and SPD (Pons-Sanchez-Cascado et al., 2003). In Rihaakuru,
a cooked ﬁsh paste, the AGM concentration is extremely vari-
able, ranging from not detected to 161 mg/kg (Naila et al., 2011),
whereas in other fermented and non-fermented ﬁsh paste, AGM is
not detectable (Kirschbaum et al., 2000). Fish storage conditions
can help to reduce the processes favoring the formation of BAs.
In particular, refrigeration with ﬂaked ice, traditionally applied to
ﬁsh, signiﬁcantly reduces AGM and the formation of other BAs
compared with refrigeration at the same temperature, but with-
out ice (Chotimarkorn, 2011). Protective atmosphere packaging
(PAP) is frequently used to prolong the shelf-life of foodstuffs,
and effectively reduces BA concentrations in different ﬁsh. In par-
ticular, Ruiz-Capillas and Moral (2004) have shown that for tuna
a gas mixture containing 60% CO2 is more effective in reducing
these moieties than a gas mixture containing 40% CO2. This was
particularly true in the case of white muscle of tuna, where after
25 days of storage an atmosphere containing 60% CO2 caused a
10-fold reduction of the AGM level compared with the control
stored in air.

MEAT AND MEAT PRODUCTS
Biogenic amines can be found in processed meat products as a con-
sequence of microbial activity related to fermentation occurring
during processing, or to microbial contamination of poor quality
raw meat. Therefore, in cooked meat products (non-fermented)
BAs may represent a useful indicator for assessing the hygienic
quality of the raw meat utilized for preparing these foodstuffs
(Bover-Cid et al., 2001). Furthermore, the nitrosable secondary

amines (AGM, SPD, and SPM) can form nitrosamines by reac-
tion with nitrites, chemical agents considered to possess major
carcinogenic properties. This is particularly important in some
meat products with high polyamine levels and whose produc-
tion process requires the use of nitrates and nitrites (Ruiz-Capillas
and Jiménez-Colmenero, 2004). As with ﬁsh, also fresh meat nor-
mally contains PAs such as SPM and SPD, the levels of which may
vary slightly in fermented and ripened meat products. In fresh
meat AGM can be found at levels ranging from not detectable
to about 3 mg/kg, while in fermented and ripened meat products
the AGM content may range more widely from not detectable to
about 43 mg/kg. However, it has been reported that in these prod-
ucts a low formation of PUT can be related to the presence of high
levels of AGM, the latter being an intermediate metabolite in the
PUT production pathway from arginine. Generally cooked meat
products show lower polyamine concentrations than fresh meat
(Hernández-Jover et al., 1996; Bover-Cid et al., 2001).

Dry-cured “lacón” is a traditional cured meat product made
in Spain, following manufacturing processes very similar to those
utilized in the production of dry-cured ham. During the manu-
facture of dry-cured lacón the content of BA may vary greatly, as
is also the case with ham. In addition, higher levels of TRYPT have
been found in fresh lacón pieces than in fresh meat, whereas AGM
has not been detected. However, AGM was generated during the
drying-ripening stage, both with and without additives and the
values reached in the ﬁnal product (around 8 mg/kg) were higher
than those found in ham (Lorenzo et al., 2007).

The technology applied in meat processing may inﬂuence BA
production. For example, sugar omission in the production of
slightly fermented sausages is not recommended, because it may
cause an increase in AGM and the accumulation of other BAs
during manufacture and storage (Bover-Cid et al., 2001). Fur-
thermore, different concentrations of BAs have been found in
fresh, fermented, and cooked meat products, either treated with
high pressure processing (HPP) or under PAP, which were closely
related to the type of product and the processing conditions. In
general, PAP has a positive effect in reducing BA formation in
these products. In commercial meat products treated with HPP,
higher BA concentrations, particularly AGM, have been reported
compared with non-treated samples. This negative effect of HPP
has also been observed in frankfurters, butifarra, cooked ham,
and chorizo; for the latter product, it has been observed how
commercially available non-treated samples may contain AGM
concentrations of about 2 mg/kg, while chorizo treated by HPP
may show a 20-fold increase in AGM content (Ruiz-Capillas and
Jiménez-Colmenero, 2004; Ruiz-Capillas et al., 2007).

MILK AND DAIRY PRODUCTS
In milk, as in other fresh foods derived from animals, SPM and
SPD are the prevalent PAs, whereas it must be reported that AGM
was not detectable (Novella-Rodríguez et al., 2002). Also in indus-
trial keﬁr, a milk product belonging to the category of mixed lactic
acid and ethanol fermented beverages, AGM was not detectable.
The estimated BA content in keﬁr, ranging from 2 to 35 mg/L, is
generally lower than that found in other fermented foods. Short
fermentation time, the use of starter culture, controlled produc-
tion conditions such as heating at 90–95˚C before fermentation

and a low microbial count in the raw material are the main reasons
for the low BA content. Higher BA levels can be expected in
artisanal or home-made keﬁr compared with industrial samples,
because of worse hygienic conditions (Özdestan and Üren, 2010b).
Cheeses represent an ideal environment for the production of
amines. The factors inﬂuencing the formation, accumulation, and
type of amines are: the availability of amino acids, the presence of
bacteria capable of decarboxylating amino acids, pH, salt concen-
tration, water availability, temperature and duration of ripening
and storage, bacterial density, the presence of cofactors, and amine
catabolism. The pH of cheese is appropriate for BA production,
generally between 5.0 and 6.5, depending on the age and type of the
products. Cheeses are also rich in pyridoxal phosphate, which is
required for amino acid decarboxylase activity. Studies have shown
that in cheese the concentration of BAs decreases with increased
fat content. This phenomenon has been attributed to changes in
the water activity, which inhibits the growth of proteolytic bacte-
ria, causing a reduction of free amino acid concentration in the
medium (Ruiz-Capillas and Jiménez-Colmenero, 2004). Numer-
ous bacteria, both intentional or adventitious and isolated from
cheese, have been reported as BA producers (Vale and Glória,
1998; Novella-Rodríguez et al., 2002). Several outbreaks of HIS
poisoning have occurred following the consumption of cheese;
also cases of hypertensive crisis and migraine headache have been

observed after the ingestion of cheeses with high levels of TRYPT
and 2-PHE. The use of bacteriocin-producing starters can prevent
the formation of HIS. Moreover, the addition of microbial isolates
that degrade BAs in order to prevent the presence of hazardous lev-
els of amines in the ﬁnal products has been proposed. Although
the type and levels of amines in each kind of cheese may vary con-
siderably, AGM is a polyamine which is rarely present in cheeses
(Vale and Glória, 1998; Novella-Rodríguez et al., 2002; Custódio
et al., 2007).

CONCLUSION
PAs are produced in all living organisms and play an impor-
tant role in cell growth and development, as well in protecting
stressed cells. Our diet also provides a daily supply of PAs, and
high PA concentrations in food can trigger toxic effects and
intensify the toxicological effect of HIS. Moreover, the beneﬁcial
effects of the polyamine AGM for human health, in its various
functions from neurotransmitter or neuromodulator, to stim-
ulator of insulin release and tumor suppressor agent are well
known. As only a limited amount of this amine is produced
in mammal cells, food ought to contain a certain quantity of
the AGM. However, the appropriate AGM level in different food
types is a complex relationship which depends on numerous
factors.
