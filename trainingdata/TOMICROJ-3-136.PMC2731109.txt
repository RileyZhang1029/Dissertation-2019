Abstract:  In  S.  cerevisiae  neither  disruption  of  the  phospholipase  B  triple  knockout  mutant  (plb1plb2plb3;  plb123)  nor 
over-expression of phospholipase Bs (PLBs) result in a phenotype different from wild type. In performing experiments to 
characterize  candidate plant phospholipase  (PLA) genes, we  found, surprisingly, that  ectopic  expression of  either of two 
different  A.  thaliana  PLA2  or  PLA1  genes  in  the  yeast  plb123  mutant  completely  inhibited  cell  growth.  We  proposed  
that  while  PLBs  might  not  be  essential  for  growth  and  metabolism  of  yeast  cells,  they  may  play  an  important  role  in  
cell  survival  by  metabolizing  excess  intracellular  lysophospholipids.  To  test  our  hypothesis,  we  overexpressed  a  plant 
phospholipase  A2  (PLA2)  in  both  WT  and  plb123  cells,  producing  a  pool  of  lysophosphatidylcholine  (lysoPtdCho)  in  
both transformants. In 14C acetate labeling experiments, WT cells were able to catabolize the resultant labeled lysoPtdCho, 
preventing  accumulation,  and  the  cells  grew  normally.  In  contrast,  in  the  triple  plb123  mutant  PLA2  transformant,  
lysoPtDCho  accumulated  more  than  4-fold  to  a  toxic  level,  inhibiting  cell  growth.  However,  this  growth  inhibition  was 
complemented by co-expression of either PLB1, PLB2 or PLB3 in the plb123 triple mutant  already expressing the plant 
PLA2. Furthermore, in labeling experiments, the rescued cells exhibited a 60-75% reduction in  14C-lysoPtdCho build-up 
compared  to  plb123PLA2  cells.  Our  data  provides  conclusive  evidence  that  yeast  PLBs  can  metabolize  intracellular  
lysoPtdCho  produced  by  plant  PLA2  overexpression  in  yeast.  Our  experiments  indicate  the  utility  of  ectopic  plant  
phospholipase  A  gene  expression  to  characterize  poorly-understood  phospholipid  metabolism  mutants  in  yeast  or  other  
organisms.

INTRODUCTION 

 
Phospholipids  are  primary  components  of  all  cell  mem-
branes. The main glycerolphospholipids in S. cerevisiae cells 
include,  from  most  to  least  abundant,  phosphatidylcholine 
(PtdCho),  phosphatidylethanolamine  (PtdEtn),  phosphatidy-
linositol  (PtdIns),  phosphatidylserine  (PtdSer)  and  phos-
phatidic  acid (PtdOH).  Membrane homeostasis is a dynamic 
condition  wherein  lipid  synthesis,  trafficking  and  degrada-
tion  are  coordinated  to  provide  and  sustain  the  integrity  
of  different  membranous  subcellular  structures  [1].  In  S.  
cerevisiae,  lipid  biosynthesis,  its  regulation  and  degradation 
are quite well understood, but  much less  is known about the 
biological function of lipid turnover, as well as the molecular 
mechanisms  that  coordinate  those  processes  leading  to 
membrane equilibrium.  

  As  phospholipid  turnover  products,  lysophospholipids 
(LysoPLs)  have  key  roles  in  cell  homeostasis.  Due  to  their 
amphipathic  nature,  LysoPLs  have  surfactant  and  detergent-
like  properties.  As  a  result,  control  of  the  in  vivo  levels  of 
LysoPLs is essential for the function and survival of cells. In 
yeast  biological  membranes,  LysoPLs  are  typically  found  at

very low concentrations, approximately 0.02 to 0.08% of dry 
cell biomass, as derived from data of Blagovic et al. [2] and 
Summers  et  al.  [3],  respectively.  The  total  lipid  content  of 
yeast  varies  widely  with  the  species.  The  majority  of  yeasts 
contain  7%-15%  total  lipids  as  a  proportion  of  dry  weight 
[4].  Accordingly,  the  proportion  of  LysoPLs  would  fall  
into  a  range  from  0.1%-1.1%  of  total  lipids  in  different  
species.  At  low  non-toxic  concentrations,  lysophospholipids 
which  are  metabolites  of 
the  mitogenically-responsive  
enzyme phospholipase A2, may be a mechanism for modulat-
ing  the  activity  of  downstream  effector  molecules.  Lyso- 
phospholipids  also  interact  with  Ras  proteins,  regulatory 
elements  for  adenylyl  cyclase,  which  catalyze  the  synthesis 
of  cAMP,  a  secondary  messenger  critical  for  cell  cycle  
progression [5]. However, higher  concentrations of LysoPLs 
have been shown to disturb membrane  conformation,  affect-
ing  the  activities  of  many  membrane-bound  enzymes,  
and may even lead to cell lysis and death [6]. As reported by 
Ko et al. [7], yeast (1,3)-(cid:1)-glucan synthase was shown to be 
inhibited  by  phospholipase  A2  and  its  reaction  products, 
principally lysophospholipids; the inhibition was due, in part, 
to  non-specific  detergent-like  membrane  disruption.  This 
may partially explain the resultant inhibition of cell multipli-
cation. In wild type yeast cells, a typical phospholipid profile 
analysis  does  not  show  any  appreciable  lyso-phospholipid 
content  [8].  In  general,  elevated  LysoPL  levels  are  usually

characteristic of  altered membrane phospholipid  metabolism 
and impaired membrane integrity in particular. 

 
In yeast, the de-acylation of PtDCho to produce glycero-
phosphodiester  and  FFA  is  currently  known  to  be  catalyzed 
by  the  enzymes  Phospholipase  B1,  B2,  B3  (Plb1p,  Plb2p, 
Plb3p)  and  neuropathy  target  esterase  (Nte1p),  encoded  by 
PLB1,  PLB2,  PLB3  and Nte1p genes, respectively.  The PLB 
genes  are  highly  similar  (>60%  identity  at  the  DNA  level). 
Phospholipase  B  activity  catalyzes  the  deacylation  of  glyc-
erophospholipids  at  both  sn-1  and  sn-2  positions.  Plbps  are 
located at the plasma membrane and in the periplasmic space 
with  different  properties  [9].  Plb1p  is  the  main  enzyme  
responsible  for  PtdCho  deacylation  with  its  product,  glyc-
erophosphocholine  (GroPCho),  released  into  the  extracellu-
lar  medium.  At  their  pH  optima,  substrate  preferences  of 
Plb1p and Plb2p are similar; both appear to accept  all major 
phospholipid  classes,  whereas  Plb3p  accepts  only  PtdIns  
and  PtdSer  as  substrates.  At  the  physiological  pH  of  yeast 
growth  medium  (around  pH 5),  Plb1p  is  primarily  respon- 
sible  for  the  degradation  of  PtdCho,  and  to  some  extent, 
PtdIns. Interestingly, overexpression of Plb2p does not result 
in  degradation  of  PtdCho  or  PtdIns,  while  Plb3p  hydrolyses 
PtdIns,  but  not  PtdCho,  in  agreement  with  the  substrate  
selectivity  observed  in  vitro  [9,  10].  Nte1p  is  a  phospho- 
lipase  B  which  resides  in  the  endoplasmic  reticulum,  
and  prefers  to  deacylate  PtdCho  produced  through  the  
CDP-choline  (Kennedy)  pathway  [11].  PtdCho  can  also  
be  hydrolyzed  by  phospholipase  D  (Spo14p)  to  produce 
phosphatidic acid (PA) [12].  

  Both  the  triple  PLB  knockout  mutant  (plb123)  and  nte1 
null  mutant  (nte1)  strains  are  viable  and  do  not  exhibit  any 
detectable phenotype beyond the lack of GroPCho formation 
[10]. It was reported that while the plb2 mutant and plb1plb2 
double mutant grew at slightly reduced rates  compared with 
wild  type  cells  when  plated  on  complete  YEPD  media  [9, 
10],  the  plb3  mutant  and  plb1plb3  double  mutant  and  the 
plb1plb2plb3  triple  mutant  grew  the  same  as  wild  type  
on  fermentable  and  non-fermentable  carbon  sources  [9,  10]. 
Merkel  et  al.  [9]  suggested  that  this  may  be  due  to  the  
presence  of  alternative  pathways,  as  was  indicated  by  some 
residual  release  of  GroPIns  and  GroPCho  from  a  strain  
lacking  all  three  phospholipase  Bs.  In  fact,  the  plb123  
mutant grows even better than wild-type cells [9; the current 
study), prompting questions about the possible physiological 
role of Plbps. 

S.  cerevisiae  has  proven  to  be  a  valuable  experimental 
 
system  to  express  and  identify  the  function  of  plant  genes 
involved  in  lipid  metabolism.  Because  the  plb123  triple  
mutant  cells  have  a  low  background  phospholipid  deacyla-
tion  activity, we  initially  tried to use  the  mutant  as  a system 
for  screening  and  expressing  some  candidate  plant  phos- 
pholipase  A  (PLA)  genes.  Surprisingly,  we  found  that  
overexpressing  some  of  the  putative  PLA  genes  in  plb123 
completely  inhibited  the  triple  mutant  cell  growth,  which 
suggested  an  important  physiological  role  for  PLBs.  It  
had  been  reported  that  overexpression  of  PLB2  conferred 
resistance  to  the  toxic  effects  of  exogenous  lysophos- 
phatidylcholine  (lysoPtdCho)  supplied  in  the  medium  at  a 
concentration  of  10  mM  (ca  0.5%  w/v  based  on  the  MW  of 
sn-1  palmitoyl  LPC),  which  was  thought  to  be  consistent 
with its function as an extracellular lysophospholipase [8, 9]. 

information  on 

Considering  this  result,  the  fact  that  Plbsp  are  located  in 
plasma  membranes,  and  because  of  the  existence  of  other 
PtdCho-hydrolysing  pathways  (like  that  involving  Nte1p), 
we  proposed  that  Plbps,  while  perhaps  not  essential  for  
metabolism and growth of yeast, may also play an important 
role  in  cell  survival  by  catabolizing  excess  intracellular  
lysophospholipids.  In  order  to  test  our  hypothesis,  we  
decided  to  reverse  conventional  approaches  and  instead  of 
using  yeast  as  a  vehicle  to  characterize  plant  genes,  use  a 
known  plant  phospholipase  A2  (PLA2),  to  collect  relevant 
metabolic 
the  poorly-understood  yeast 
plb123  mutant.  Theoretically,  overexpressing  plant  PLA2  
in  yeast  cells  will  produce  a  pool  of  lysophospholipids.  If  
the  cells  posses  the  capacity  to  catabolize  these  lysophos-
pholipids,  preventing  accumulation,  the  cells  will  grow  nor-
mally.  In  contrast,  if  the  cells  are  devoid  of  this  capacity, 
lysophospholipids  will  accumulate  to  a  toxic  concentration. 
This test system provided direct proof that Plbps, as opposed 
to  other  pathways,  can  scavenge  intracellular  lysoPtdCho 
produced by overexpression of PLA2. Moreover, it indicated 
the  utility  of  using  plant  PLA  genes  to  screen  yeast  
phospholipid  mutants  and  understand  nature  of  the  lesions 
therein.

using  the  S.c.  EasyCompTm  Transformation  kit.  Genomic 
yeast  DNA  was  isolated  and  prepared  for  gene  cloning  
by  the  method  of  Sambrook  and  Russell  [13].  Escherichia

and  used  for  plasmid  transformation  by  a  standard  method 
[14].  

Cloning  the  PLA2  from  Arabidopsis  and  Expression  in 
Yeast 

  Total  RNA  was  extracted  from  Arabidopsis  leaves  using 
the  RNeasy®  plant  Mini  Kit  and  cDNA  was  synthesized  by 
superscript II® reverse transcription according to the product 
instructions.  The  primers  PLA2F87  and  PLA2R536  (see 
Table  2)  were  designed  to  amply  the  coding  region  of  
phospholipase  A2  (At2g06925)  [14],  designated  as  PLA2. 
Arabidopsis  leaf  cDNA  was  used  to  amplify  PLA2  by  Pfu 
Turbo®  DNA  polymerase.  To  the  resultant  blunt  end  PCR 
product,  an  adenine  overhang  was  added  at  the  3'  end  using 
Taq  DNA  polymerase,  and  the  amplicon  cloned  into  the 
yeast  shuttle  vector  pYES2.1  in  the  Top  10F’  strain.  After 
confirming  cloning  integrity  by  sequencing,  the  vector  was 
transformed  into  both  the  WT  and  the  plb123  triple  mutant 
yeast  strains  using  the  S.c.  EasyCompTm  Transformation  
kit.  The  self-ligated  pYES2.1  was  also  transformed  into  the 
triple mutant and WT strains as controls (see Table 1).

RT-PCR Confirmation of PLA2 Expression in WT Yeast 

  Both  wild-type  S.  cerevisiae  bearing  the  empty  vector 
and  yeast  cells  bearing  PLA2  were  inoculated  in  YPD

medium  containing  2%  of  dextrose.  Cells  were  cultured  at 
28°C for 24 hr, followed by culture in YPD medium contain-
ing  2%  (cid:2)-galactose  at  28°C  for  12  hr.  Total  RNA  was  
isolated from both wild-type S.  cerevisiae bearing the empty 
vector  and  transgenic  cells  bearing PLA2  using  the  standard 
method of Sambrook and Russell [13]. To examine the trans- 
cript  levels  in  transformed  yeast,  two  micrograms  of  DNase 
I-treated  RNA  were  used  as  a  template  for  cDNA  synthesis 
(Invitrogen  superscript  First-Strand  Synthesis  kit).  To  
exclude  genomic  DNA  contamination,  DNA-free  RNAs 
were  tested by PCR using pLA2 primers (See Table 2). The 
yeast  actin  gene  ACT1/YFL039C  was  amplified  (using 
primers  ACTF  and  ACTR,  Table  2)  and  used  as  an  endo- 
genous  standard  to  confirm  mRNA  quality.  The  cDNA  
samples  were  diluted  50-fold  for  PCR  amplification.  The 
PCR  program:  DNA  denaturation  at  94°C  for  4  min,  
followed  by  35  cycles  of  PCR  at  94°C  for  30  seconds; 
primer  annealing  at  53°C  for  30  seconds  and  extension  and 
incubation  at  72°C  for  5.75  min,  then  cooling  at  4°C.  PCR 
products  were  resolved  by  electrophoresis  on  1%  agarose 
gels. The expected amplified fragment size of yeast actin and 
pLA2  are  525  bp  and  450  bp,  respectively.  Functional  
expression  of  the  PLA2  was  confirmed  by  phospholipase  
A2 assay as described below. 

Plate Assay of Strain Growth 

  All  strains  were  cultured  to  stationary  phase  in  SC  
medium  with  glucose  and  adjusted  to  an  OD600  of  3.0  as  a 
starting  concentration;  cells  were  also  diluted  1:10,  1:100 
and  1:1000  with  SC  medium  without  saccharide.  Ten  μl  of 
each  was  spotted  on  plates  with  different  media  containing 
either glucose or galactose. After 2, 3 and 5 days, the degree 
of cell growth was determined.  

Phospholipase A2 Assay 

 
PLA2 activity was measured as the release of radioactive 
free [1-14C] oleic  acid from the substrate L-(cid:1)-1-palmitoyl-2-
oleoyl[1-14C]-PtdCho.  The  substrate  was  dried  under  a 
stream  of  N2  before  adding  the  other  reaction  components. 
Standard enzyme assay mixtures contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, 
pH 8.0, 10 mM  CaCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1μCi of 
the substrate (55mCi/mmol), in a total volume of 200 μl. The 
mixtures were emulsified by sonication at room temperature 
for 3 min. and reactions started by addition of 60 μg of trans-
formant  lysate  protein.  The  reactions  were  incubated  in  a 
shaking water bath at 30ºC for 30 min and terminated by the 
addition  of  750  μL  of  chloroform:  methanol  (1:2,  v/v).  The 
lipids were extracted and spotted onto a thin layer chromato- 
graphy  plate  (Silica  Gel  G),  which  was  developed  with  
chloroform: methanol: NH4OH: water (73:30:4:1). The spots 
corresponding  to  the  lipid  standards  FFA  and  lysoPtdCho, 
were  then  scraped  into  vials,  4  ml  scintillation  fluid  added 
(Aquasol-2,  DuPont)  and  the  radioactivity  determined  by 
standard scintillation counting. 

Labeling  Yeast  Cells  with  Radioactive  Sodium  Acetate 
and Lyso-Phosphocholine Analysis 

  Yeast  cells  were  cultured  in  SC-URA  medium  with  
glucose. The cells from stationary stage cultures were diluted 
to  OD600  0.1  in  a  20  ml  volume.  30(cid:1)Ci  of  [1-14C]-  labeled 
sodium  acetate  was  diluted  in  SC  medium  and  the  labeled 

solution filtered before adding to the cultures. The cells were 
inoculated  and  incubated  for  10  hours  at  28ºC.  The  cultures 
were then divided in half; One half continued to be incubated 
in glucose medium, while with the other half, collected cells 
were  washed  twice  with  sterilized  water  and  transferred  
to  galactose  medium.  After  5  hours  incubation,  cells  were 
collected  and  washed  twice  with  PBS  (10  mM  phosphate, 
2.7  mM  KCl,  137  mM  NaCl,  pH7.4),  to  be  analyzed  for  
lipids.  Cells  were  homogenized  with  an  equal  volume  of 
glass  beads  using  the  BeadBeater  at  4ºC  using  3  bursts  of  1 
min.  Total  lipids  were  extracted  by  adding  2  ml  of  chloro-
form:methanol:KCl/HNO3(1:2:0.8,v/v/v)  vortexing  and  then 
adding  2ml  dichloromethane  and  the  total  lipids  were 
recovered  from  the  lower  organic  phase.  The  labeled  lipids 
were  separated  by  two-dimensional  thin  layer  chromato- 
graphy  on  Silica  gel  60  plates  using  chloroform/methanol/ 
acetic  acid/water  (80:9:12:2)  as  the  first,  and  chloro-
form/methanol/acetic  acid/water  (50:25:10:2)  as  the  second 
developing  solvent,  respectively.  The  TLC  plates  were 
screened  by  a  TLC  Imaging  Scanner  (Bioscan,  WA,  USA). 
Relevant spots were scraped and quantified by liquid scintil-
lation counting.  

Co-Culture Experiments 

  The  plb123  mutant  was  transformed  by  two  empty  
vectors  with  URA  and  LEU  selection  markers  respectively 
(designated plbEVEV). while the wild type  cells were  trans-
formed  by  PLA2  expression  vector  or  its  empty  vector 
pYES2.1  with  URA  selection  marker  only  and  designated  
as  WTPLA2  and  WTEV,  respectively.  The  WTPLA2  was 
then  co-cultured  with  plbEVEV  (WTEV  co-cultured  with 
plbEVEV was used as the control). Under the induced condi-
tion,  we  wanted  to  determine  whether  WTPLA2  could  
release enough lysoPC to affect the growth of plb123 mutant 
cells.  In  order  to  fully  reflect  the  PLA2  effect,  10-times  the 
number  of  WTPLA2  cells  and  WTEV  cells  were  grown 
against  plbEVEV  cells,  which  were  mixed  together  for  
co-culture as follows: After WTEV, WTPLA2 and plbEVEV 
were cultured to OD600 3.0, WTEV and WTPLA2 cells were 
each diluted to OD600 1.0 while plbEVEV  cells were diluted 
to  OD600  0.1  and  then  the  preparations  co-cultured.  Then 
either  before  induction  or  after  two  days  induction  in  the 
presence of galactose, cultures were diluted 100-fold and 10 
(cid:1)l  was  spread  on  plates  with  SC-URA-LEU  medium  and 
colonies counted.  

Cloning  the  PLB1,  PLB2  and  PLB3  Genes  from  Yeast 
and Expression in the plb123 triple Mutant 

  Yeast  DNA  was  extracted  by  the  method  of  Sambrook 
and  Russell  [13].  The  primers  PLB1F1,  PLB1R1995, 
PLB2F1,  PLB2R2121,  PLB3F1,  PLB3R2061  (see  Table  2) 
with NotI or SacI sites (underlined) were designed to amply 
the  coding  region  of  PLB1,  PLB2,  and  PLB3,  respectively 
using  Pfu  Turbo®  DNA  polymerase.  To  the  resultant  blunt 
end  PCR  products,  adenine  overhangs  were  added  at  the  3' 
ends  using  Taq  DNA  polymerase  and  the  amplicons  cloned 
into  pCR®2.1-Topo®  TA  vector.  After  confirming  sequence 
integrity,  the  plasmids  were  digested  by  NotI/SacI,  the 
1.99kb  PLB1,  2.12kb  PLB2  and  2.06kb  PLB3  were  recov-
ered from the gel and each ligated into the NotI/SacI sites in 
the  yeast  shuttle  vector  pESC-LEU.  The  plasmids  and  the 

140    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2009, Volume 3 

pYES2.1PLA2  (described  above)  were  co-transformed  into 
the  plb123  triple  mutant  using  the  S.c.  EasyCompTm  Trans-
formation  kit  and  transformant  cells  selected  on  SC-LEU-
URA  medium.  The  self-ligated  pYES2.1  and  empty  pESC-
Leu  vector  were  also  used  to  transform  the  triple  mutant 
strain  as  a  control.  The  product  strains  and  their  genotypes 
are shown in Table 1.  

RESULTS 

  While screening a number of putative plant PLA genes by 
over-expression  in  the plb123 triple  mutant  strain, we found 
that  there  was  generally  a  complete  inhibition  of  growth. 
Thus,  we  considered  using  a  reverse  strategy-  one  of  using  
a  known  plant  PLA2  gene  to  determine  whether  PLBs  may 
play  an  important  role  in  cell  survival,  perhaps  by  scaveng-
ing excess lysophospholipids. Although there are reports that 
PLA  activity  can  be  measured  in  yeast,  there  have  been  no 
yeast PLA genes cloned thus far [15], making the availability 
of  the  plant  PLA  gene  even  more  valuable  in  probing  yeast 
phospholipid  metabolism  mutations.  A  PLA2  gene  from 
Arabidopsis (At2g06925) encodes a 149-amino acid protein, 
identified  as  phospholipase  A2,  which  deacylates  phosphol-
ipids  at  the  sn-2  position  to  produce  lysophospholipids  
and  FFAs  [14].  The  Arabidopsis  PLA2  was  cloned  into  the 
yeast  shuttle  vector  pYES2.1,  in  which  PLA2  was  driven  
by  GAL1  promoter  (see  Materials  and  methods).  The GAL1 
promoter  can  be  inhibited  by  glucose  and  stimulated  by  
galactose [16].  

Functional Expression of the Arabidopsis PLA2 in Yeast 

  WT  yeast  strain  W3031A  was  transformed  with  either 
pYESPLA2  plasmid  or  with  empty  vector  (control).  PLA2 
expression  was  confirmed  by  RT-PCR  (Fig.  1).  To  assess 
whether  the  expressed  AtPLA2  had  functional  activity,  
cells were  collected from exponential  stage cultures induced  

Zhang et al. 

in  galactose  medium,  lysed  and  the  lysate  used  in  phos- 
pholipase A2 assays as described in Materials and methodol-
ogy.  The  release  of  sn-2  14C-labeled  oleic  acid  from  L-(cid:1)-1-
palmitoyl-2-oleoyl[1-14C]-PtdCho  was  15-fold  higher  than 
the  low  background  activity  in  the  WT  yeast.  This  experi-
ment  confirmed  that  the  plant  PLA2  gene  was  functionally 
expressed  in  yeast  cells  and  encoded  a  protein  with  
phospholipase  A2  activity.  Furthermore,  expression  of  the 
AtPLA2 was not toxic to WT yeast. 

The  Over-Expression  of  Plant  PLA2s  Completely  
Inhibits  the  Growth  of  Yeast  plb123  Triple  Mutant  
Cells but has no Obvious Effect on Wild Type Cells 

  When  the  Arabidopsis  PLA2  was  introduced  into  the 
plb123  triple  mutant  and  maintained  on  SC-URA  medium 
with glucose, the PLA2 was not expressed, and there were no 
obvious  changes  in  cell  growth  compared  to  the  empty  vec-
tor controls or the WTPLA2 transformants. Once cultured in 
the  medium  containing  galactose,  the  empty  vector  control 
cells  and  WTPLA2  cells  grew  normally,  but  the  growth  of 
plb123  cells  harbouring  PLA2  (plbPLA2)  was  completely 
inhibited  (Fig.  2).  The  results  were  identical  even  after  5 
days of incubation (data not shown). These results show that 
the growth  inhibition of the plb123 triple mutant was due  to 
the expression of PLA2, and that such inhibition acts only in 
the plb123 triple mutant cells, but not in wild type cells.  

  To  determine  whether  the  cells  were  dead  or  growth 
merely  inhibited  when  PLA2  was  expressed,  cells  induced 
for  3  and  6  days  in  galactose  liquid  medium  were  collected 
and  washed,  re-suspended  in  glucose  medium  and  re-plated 
on  glucose  plates.  The  cells  were  once  again  able  to  grow, 
suggesting  that  overexpression  of  AtPLA2  was  not  lethal  to 
the plb123 cells, but rather, temporarily inhibited cell growth 
(data not shown).

free RNA as the template there is no signal with the PLA2 primers, confirming that there is no possibility that genomic DNA contamination 
in the cDNA templates could have resulted in the PLA2 band as observed in Lane 4.

The  Over-Expression  of  Plant  PLA2s  Leads  to  A  Toxic 
Accumulation of lysoPtdCho in plb123 Cells 

  Once we confirmed that the plant PLA2 was functionally 
expressed (see  above), we speculated  that  its overexpression 
could  be  used  to  stimulate  an  accumulation  of  lysophos- 

pholipids  and/or  free  fatty  acids,  which  might  be  toxic  to  
the  plb123  cells.  No  obvious  accumulation  of  free  fatty  
acids  was  found  in  growth-inhibited  cells  (data  not  shown). 
Because  of  the  very  low  level  of  endogenous  lysophos- 
pholipids,  such  as  lysoPtdCho,  in  yeast  cells,  it  was  neces-
sary  to  label  the  phospholipids  by  feeding  cells  with  14C  
acetate to estimate relative polar lipid pool sizes. In prelimi-
nary  experiments,  we  found  that  the  phospholipids  were 
well-labeled  during  the  exponential  phase  but  not  in  later 
phases (data not shown). This is consistent with the fact that 
neutral, not polar,  lipids  accumulate  in the  late phase of cell 
growth. Thus labeling was performed during the exponential 
phase of growth.  

  While  most  major  phospholipids  of  WTEV,  WTPLA2, 
plbEV  and  plbPLA2  strains  were  all  labeled,  among  lyso 
phospholipids  only  lysoPtdCho  (and  not  lysoPtdEtn,  lyso 
PtdIns,  lysoPtdSer)  was  significantly  labeled.  The  level  of 
lysoPtdCho  in  induced  plbPLA2  increased  more  than  4-fold 
over  the  low  endogenous  level  consistently  observed  in  
control cells (Fig. 3). In WT cells expressing PLA2 (WTPLA2) 
there  was no  enhanced accumulation of lysoPtdCho and cell 
growth was unaffected.  Collectively, these results mean  that 
the  over-expression  of  plant  PLA2  can  be  used  to  produce 
lysophospholipids,  mainly  lysoPtdCho,  which  can  be  cata- 
bolized by wild type yeast, but accumulates  in the plb triple 
mutant.  This  suggests  that  phospholipase  Bs  play  an  impor-
tant  role  in  scavenging  excessive  lysoPtdCho  in  yeast  cells 
and that the plb123 mutant has lost this ability.

(cid:1)Ci  14C-sodium  acetate  for  10  hours.  Half  of  culture  remained  in  glucose  medium  while  the  other  half  was  induced  in  galactose  medium  
for 5 hours. The total lipids were extracted and resolved by two dimensional thin layer chromatography and each of the phospholipids was 
quantified (see Materials and methodology). The proportions of 14C-labeled LysoPtdCho (relative to the total 14C phospholipids) are depicted

respectively 

  Because  in  Arabidopsis,  PLA2,  has  been  observed  in 
both intracellular and extracellular spaces [14] , the possibil-
ity remained that the expressed AtPLA2 is producing lysoPC 
extracellularly  at  a  level  high  enough  to  also  inhibit  the 
growth  of  the  plb123  mutant.  In  that  case,  using  PLA2  
expression  to  produce  lysoPC  would  not  be  a  qualitatively 
different  experiment  than  providing  lysoPC  to  the  culture 
media.  To  demonstrate  that  it  was  the  ectopic  expression  of 
the  plant  PLA2  giving  rise  to  increased intracellular lysoPC 
that  was  primarily  responsible  for  the  growth  inhibition,  we 
designed  the  following  co-culture  experiment:  The  plb123 
mutant  was  transformed  by  two  empty  vectors  with  URA 
and  LEU  selection  markers, 
(designated 
plbEVEV),  while  the  wild  type  cells  were  transformed  with 
the  PLA2  expression  vector  or  with  its  empty  vector 
pYES2.1,  with  URA  selection  marker  only,  and  designated 
as  WTPLA2  and  WTEV,  respectively.  We  then  co-cultured 
WTPLA2  with  plbEVEV  and,  as  a  control,  we  co-cultured 
WTEV with plbEVEV. Under induced (+ gal) conditions, we 
wondered  whether  WTPLA2  might  release  some  amount  of 
extracellular  lysoPC,  which  might  affect  the  growth  of  the 
plb123  mutant  cells.  After  two  days  of  induction,  the  co-
cultures  were  diluted  and  spread  on  plates  with  SC-URA-
LEU  medium. Due to  the presence of  the both selection nu-
trients, only plbEVEV cells were able to grow, while WTEV 
or WTPLA2  could  not.  By  counting  colony  numbers  it  was 
possible  to  evaluate  the  effect  of lysophospholipids  released 
by  WTPLA2  on  plbEVEV  cells.  Our  results  showed  that 
there  is no difference in growth between the two co-cultures 
(Table  3).  Combining  these  results  with  those  from  14C  
acetate  labeling  experiments  (above),  it  is  clear  that  the  
intracellular  accumulation  of  lysoPC  by  AtPLA2  expression 
was  the  principle  reason  for  the  growth  inhibition  of  the 
plb123 mutant.  

 
In  order  to  determine  whether  one  or  other  of  the  
phospholipase Bs could rescue plb123 cell growth which had 
been  inhibited by  the over-expression of AtPLA2,  each PLB 
gene  was  co-expressed  separately  with PLA2  in  plb123.  All 
three PLB genes could rescue cell growth (Fig. 4). Under our 
experimental  conditions,  there  was  no  difference  in  the  rate 
of growth in the rescued cells. Most importantly,  14C acetate 
labeling  experiments  showed  that  those  cells  rescued  by  co-
expression of any of the three PLB genes exhibited a 60-75% 
reduction  in  the  14C  lysoPtdCho  which  otherwise  accumu-
lated  to  a  toxic  level  in  the  case  of  the  plb123PLA2  trans-
formant  (Fig.  5).  Thus,  it  appears  that  lysoPtdCho  threshold 
proportions of 0.5% or higher are highly toxic to  the plb123 
mutant, which is supported by the earlier findings of Merkel 
et  al.  [9]  and  Fyrst  et  al.  [8]  in  studies  of  PLPB2  as  a  puta-
tive  extra-cellular  lysophospholipase.  We  also  co-expressed 
in  plb123,  one  of  PLB1,  PLB2  or  PLB3  with  another  
Arabidopsis  PLA  gene,  PLA1  (At2g44810),  and  found  that 
the  growth  inhibition  caused  by  this  PLA1  could  also  be  
rescued by each of the PLBs (data not shown). These results 
demonstrate  that  PLBs  are  redundant  in  scavenging  excess 
lysoPtdCho, and that such mechanisms are generally induced 
by plant PLA expression in plb123 cells.  

DISCUSSION 

LysoPtdCho  is  an  important  lysophospholid  in  cells;  its 
 
potential generation and degradation in yeast cells is summa-
rized in the simplified model shown Fig. (6). The production 
of  lysoPtdCho  occurs  via  different  pathways:  One  is  via the 
deacylation  of  PtdCho  by  Plb1p,  Plb2p  and  Nte1p  [8,  9,  11, 
17];  In  the  other  pathway,  lysoPtdCho  is  taken  up  into  the 
intracellular  compartment  by  the  action  of  Dnf2p  [18,  19]. 
When  GroPcho  is  taken  up  into  yeast  by  Git1p, lysoPtdCho 
can  be  produced  by  GPCAT  [20,  21].  LysoPtdCho  can  be

lation  of  lysoPC.  In  Co-Cultivation  Experiments,  the  plb123  Mutant  was  Transformed  by  Empty  Vectors  pYES2.1  and 
pESC  with  URA  and  LEU  Selection  Markers  (Called  plbEVEV),  WT  was  Transformed  by  the  Empty  Vector  (Called 
WTEV)  or  by  PLA2  (Called  WTPLA2)  with  the  URA  Selection  Marker.  The  WTPLA2  was  Then  Co-Cultured  with 
plbEVEV  (WTEV  Co-Cultured  with  plbEVEV  was  Used  as  the  Control).  Cells  were  Induced  to  Determine  Whether 
WTPLA2 Could Release Enough lysoPC to Affect the Growth of plb123 Mutant Cells. In Order to Fully Reflect the PLA2 
Effect, 10-Times the Number of WTPLA2 Cells and WTEV Cells were Grown Against plbEVEV Cells, which were Mixed 
Together  for  Co-Culture  as  Follows:  After  WTEV,  WTPLA2  and  plbEVEV  were  Cultured  to  OD600  3.0,  WTEV  and 
WTPLA2 Cells were Each Diluted to OD600 1.0 while plbEVEV Cells were Diluted to OD600 0.1 and Then the Preparations 
Co-Cultured.  Then  Either  Before  Induction  or  After  Two  Days  Induction  in  the  Presence  of  Galactose,  Cultures  were  
Diluted 100-fold and 10 (cid:1)l was Spread on Plates with SC-URA-LEU Medium and Colonies Counted.

sis  that  this  effect  was  due  primarily  to  intracellular,  rather 
than extracellular, lysoPtdCho accumulation.  

  There  are  several  ways  to  eliminate  excess  lysoPtdCho. 
LysoPtdCho  can  be  converted  to  PtdCho  in  the  presence  of 
acyl-CoA  by  lysophosphylcholine:acyl-CoA  acyltransferase 
(LPCAT;  EC  2.3.1.23)  and  there  are  several  recent  reports  
to  support  this  [23-27].  Over-expression  of  LPCAT  can  
enhance  the  cell’s  resistance  to  lysoPtdCho  [27].  In  yeast, 
there  is  also  a  mitochondrial  acyl-CoA-independent  LPCAT 
activity,  mediated  by  Taz1  [28].  Finally,  lysoPtdCho  can  
also be  catabolized via Plb1p,  Plb2p,  Plb3p or Nte1p. Over-
expression of PLBs was known to enhance  cell resistance  to 
lysoPtdCho  and  the  plb123  triple  mutant  cells  showed  more 
sensitivity  to  LysoPtdCho  [8,  9]  .  At  the  time,  extracellular 
PLB activity was known but  the existence of  the exogenous 
lysolipid metabolism (ELM) pathway, reported only recently 
[19],  was  not.  Thus  it  was  thought  that  PLBs  could  degrade 
exogenous  lysophospholipids  and  increase  the  resistance  to 
the occurrence of such lipids in the medium; the degradation 
of LysoPtdCho by PLBs was considered to occur only extra-
cellularly. 

 
In  our  hands,  and  consistent  with  these  previous  studies, 
when  cultured  on  synthetic  minimal  medium  (SC)  supple-
mented  with  appropriate  nutrients  (BSM-URA  or  BSM-
LEU-URA  plus  glucose  or  galactose),  we  did  not  observe 
any apparent difference in growth rate between the wild type 
and  plb1plb2plb3  triple  mutant.  In  this  study,  by  means  of 
expressing  an  AtPLA2  in  plb123  and WT  cells  and  compar-
ing their growth with un-induced cells, we found that expres-
sion  of  AtPLA2  could  completely  inhibit  growth  of  the 
plb123  triple  mutant  cells,  but  not  that  of  wild  type  cells. 
Further  investigation  revealed  that  excessive  lysoPtdCho 
accumulation  occurred  only  in  plb123  cells  expressing  the 
AtPLA2.  Co-cultivation  experiments  supported  the  hypothe-

inhibition, 

from  growth 

  Complementation  experiments  showed  that  all  three 
PLBs  could  rescue  the  growth  inhibition  of  plb123  triple 
mutant  cells  caused  by AtPLA2  expression.  Finally,  in  addi-
tion 
the  cells  of 
plb123PLA2  complemented  with  PLBs  also  exhibited  a 
dramatic  60-75%  reduction  in  lysoPtdCho  accumulation. 
Collectively,  these  findings  directly  support  our  hypothesis 
that  Plbps  play  a  very  important  role  in  catabolizing  excess 
intracellular  lysoPtdCho.  Phospholipase  B  exhibits  three 
activities  in  vitro:  1)  phospholipase  A  activity;  2)  lysophos-
pholipase  activity;  3)  transacylase  activity.  The  lysophos-
pholipase  activity  of  Plb1p  and  Plb2p  is  about  100  fold 
higher than its PLPase A activity; even its transacylase activ-
ity  is  higher  than  that  of  PLPase  A.  In  this  regard,  it  is 
probably more suitable to refer to Plbs as lysophospholipases 
or transacylases, rather than phospholipase Bs. As the excep-
tion,  no  lysophospholipase  activity  has  been  detected  in 
Plb3p,  but  it  shows  some  transacylase  activity  [12].  Thus, 
our  observation  that  Plb3p  can  rescue  the  growth  inhibition 
of the plb123 triple mutant expressing the AtPLA2, might be 
due to Plb3p acting as a transacylase.  

CONCLUSION 

 
In conclusion, our results show  that PLBs can efficiently 
eliminate  excess lysoPtdCho produced by  PLA2  to maintain 
healthy cell growth. In the  absence of  any experimental  evi-
dence, it cannot be excluded that extrusion and processing by 
transporters such as Nte1p,  also contribute to  the processing 
of lysoPC to maintain homeostasis. It is, however, interesting 
to note that, even though NTE1 and LPCAT are still present 
in the plb123 mutant, our results suggest that the intracellular 
lysoPtdCho  which  accumulates  in  the  presence  of  over-

expressed  Arabidopsis  PLAs  is  more  reliant  on  PLBs  to 
maintain  yeast  membrane  homoestasis  through  lipid  catabo-
lism. Our results do not preclude other roles for PLBs. Given 
that the common reaction product of PLAs acting on PtdCho 
is  lysoPtdCho,  and  that  we  were  able  only  to  observe  
increases  in  this  specific  lyso-phospholipid  upon  expression 
of PLA2, it is reasonable  to assume that  the over-expression 
product in this case is solely lysoPtdCho. However, this does 
not  a  priori,  rule  out  other  unknown  lipid  products  being 
produced.
