Ubiquitination is a post-translational modiﬁcation in which one or more ubiquitin molecules
are covalently linked to lysine residues of target proteins. The ubiquitin system plays a key
role in the regulation of protein degradation, which contributes to cell signaling, vesicu-
lar trafﬁcking, apoptosis, and immune regulation. Bacterial and viral pathogens exploit the
cellular ubiquitin system by encoding their own proteins to serve their survival and repli-
cation in infected cells. Recent studies have revealed that Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV) manipulates the ubiquitin system of infected cells to facilitate cell
proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and evasion from immunity. This review summarizes recent
developments in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms used by KSHV to interact
with the cellular ubiquitin machinery.

INTRODUCTION
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as
human herpesvirus 8, is classiﬁed as a rhadinovirus in the γ-
herpesvirus subfamily and was the eighth human herpesvirus
to be discovered from Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) specimens (Chang
et al., 1994). KSHV is closely associated with KS and is also linked
to AIDS-related lymphoproliferative disorders, such as primary
effusion lymphoma (PEL, also known as body cavity-based lym-
phoma) and plasmablastic variant multicentric Castlemans dis-
ease (Russo et al., 1996; Ganem, 2007). The neoplastic potential
of KSHV is well-established, especially in the context of immuno-
suppressed patients who are undergoing organ transplants, or who
are co-infected with human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV).

Like other herpesviruses, KSHV has two life cycles (i.e., latency
and lytic replication). In latency, the KSHV genome circularizes
and forms a double-stranded DNA, the episome, in the nucleus of a
host cell. The KSHV genome contains several homologs of human
genes such as viral cyclin D (v-cyclin), viral FLICE inhibitory pro-
tein (v-FLIP), viral G-protein coupled receptor (vGPCR), vIRF1,
vBcl2, and vIL6 (Jenner and Boshoff, 2002), which contribute
directly to KSHV-induced pathogenesis. KSHV establishes a latent
infection in KS and PEL expressing several viral genes, includ-
ing latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA), v-FLIP, v-cyclin,
kaposin, and microRNAs. LANA (also called LANA1) encoded by
ORF73 is required for replication and maintenance of the KSHV
episomal DNA (Ballestas et al., 1999) and is expressed in all KSHV-
associated malignancies (Järviluoma and Ojala, 2006). LANA also
contributes to KSHV-associated oncogenesis through interaction
with cellular molecules. KSHV alternates between lytic replica-
tion (productive infection) and latency (latent infection) by way
of replication and transcription activator (RTA) expression. RTA,

encoded by the immediate-early gene ORF50, is a critical switch
molecule for initiating lytic replication (Deng et al., 2007). During
lytic infection, progeny viruses are generated and released from
host cells.

Kaposi’s

sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and other her-
pesviruses have a unique feature: KSHV can manipulate cellu-
lar machineries, such as cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and
immune surveillance, by hijacking the cellular ubiquitin system,
including polyubiquitin-dependent degradation by the 26S pro-
teasome. The ubiquitin system plays fundamental roles in the
regulation of cellular events, such as protein degradation, sig-
nal transduction, endocytosis, protein trafﬁcking, and immune
responses (Pickart, 2001; Ciechanover, 2005). It is well known
that many viruses exploit the ubiquitin system in various ways for
entry or release of progeny virus (Bieniasz, 2006) and also manip-
ulate the system to overcome the cellular apoptosis machinery and
immune responses. Additionally, viruses target deubiquitinating
enzymes (DUBs) to stabilize cellular and viral proteins needed
for viral processes (Sulea et al., 2006). In this review, we discuss
how KSHV can hijack the cellular ubiquitin system to promote
successful viral infection.

THE UBIQUITIN SYSTEM AND 26S PROTEASOME AS
TARGETS OF KSHV’S STRATEGY
THE UBIQUITIN SYSTEM AND KSHV
In the ubiquitin system, a substrate protein is tagged with a
polyubiquitin chain or a single ubiquitin molecule via isopeptide
bonds that are formed between the carboxyl termini of ubiquitin
molecules and either the ε-amino groups of the lysine residues
in the target protein or the ubiquitin molecules themselves.
Ubiquitin conjugation is catalyzed by the sequential actions of

The ubiquitin system and KSHV

ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
(E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3). In this system, ubiquitin, a
polypeptide of 76 amino acid residues, is ﬁrst transferred to the E1
in an ATP-dependent manner (Figure 1A). This activated ubiqui-
tin is then transferred to the E2. Finally, the ubiquitin is covalently
attached to the target protein by E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to the
formation of a polyubiquitin chain (Pickart, 2001; Ciechanover,
2005; Weissman et al., 2011).

Ubiquitin has seven internal Lys residues, at positions 6, 11, 27,
29, 33, 48, and 63; Lys48 is most commonly used for the formation
of a polyubiquitin chain. Ubiquitination consists of monoubiq-
uitination and polyubiquitination, and ubiquitination can be
classiﬁed into two types: a degradation signal for the 26S protea-
some (Figure 1B), and a non-degradation signal (Figures 1C,D).
Polyubiquitination can be reversed by the isopeptidase activi-
ties of DUBs, also called deubiquitinase and isopeptidase, and
of the POH1/Rpn11 subunit of the 26S proteasome. DUBs dis-
assemble polyubiquitin chains from polyubiquitinated substrates,
and also replenish the pool of free ubiquitin. Monoubiquitina-
tion, the conjugation of a single ubiquitin molecule, is involved
in DNA repair, protein–protein interactions, and endocytosis of

membrane proteins (Hicke, 2001). The polyubiquitin chain, linked
through Lys48 (K48-linked polyubiquitin), functions as a signal
for degradation by the 26S proteasome. On the other hand, it
has been thought that the polyubiquitin chain linked through
Lys other than Lys48 (i.e., Lys6, 11, 27, 29, 33, and 63), plays a
role in numerous cellular events. In particular, K63-linked polyu-
biquitin is involved in protein–protein interactions, cell signaling
pathways, DNA repair, the stress response, and ribosomal function
(Weissman et al., 2011; Figure 1C). Moreover, K63-linked polyu-
biquitination functions as a signal that induces internalization and
lysosome-mediated degradation through endocytosis toward cell
surface proteins (Hicke, 1999; Figure 1D).

Recent studies have shown that KSHV targets the ubiquitin
system to manipulate cell signaling pathways, apoptosis, cell cycle
regulation, IFN response, and antigen presentation. KSHV dysreg-
ulates the stabilities of regulator molecules p53, p27, IκB, Notch,
and β-catenin. By hijacking regulator molecules, KSHV is able to
alter viral and cellular gene expression. Additionally, KSHV can
utilize the ubiquitin system by providing its own viral protein as
an E3 enzyme or as a component protein of the E3 complex. It
was reported that KSHV-encoded RTA acted as the E3 ubiquitin

FIGURE 1 | Schematic of the ubiquitin system and 26S
proteasome-mediated degradation. (A) Ubiquitin is ﬁrst transferred to
E1 in an ATP-dependent manner. This process requires the initial
ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin, with the release of PPi, followed by
binding of ubiquitin to a cysteine residue of E1 through a thioester linkage.
Then, the activated ubiquitin is transferred to E2. Some selectivity for
substrate occurs in this step, but the exquisite selectivity of intracellular
proteolysis comes from the E3 ubiquitin ligases, which couple with E2 to
bind substrates and catalyze the transfer of the activated ubiquitin from
the E2 to the substrate, processively forming a chain of ubiquitins. (B) In
the case of conjugation with K48-linked polyubiquitin, the
polyubiquitinated protein is recognized by the 26S proteasome and is

destroyed in an ATP-dependent manner. The 26S proteasome consists of
the 19S regulatory complex (19RP) and a proteolytic core particle, the 20S
proteasome. The 20S proteasome is arranged as a stack of four rings,
composed of two outer α rings and two inner β rings. Three β subunits (β2,
β5, β1) of a β ring are responsible for the distinct trypsin-like,
chymotrypsin-like, and caspase-like proteolytic activities, respectively. (C)
Modiﬁcations of a monoubiquitin and a polyubiquitin chain linked through
Lys other than Lys48 (for example, Lys63, Lys11, and Lys29) play a role in
many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, DNA repair, and
localization through protein–protein interactions. (D) Monoubiquitination
and K63-linked polyubiquitination are also involved in the internalization
and endocytosis of membrane proteins.

ligase, and mediates polyubiquitination of IFN regulatory factor 7
(IRF7) for proteasomal degradation. KSHV-encoded LANA func-
tions as a potential component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
for polyubiquitination of p53 and VHL (Figure 1B). KSHV also
encodes ubiquitin ligases (K3 and K5) that induce the K63-linked
polyubiquitination and internalization of major histocompatibil-
ity complex class I (MHC-I) molecules (Figure 1D). Furthermore,
KSHV encodes a viral DUB which can disassemble polyubiquitin
chains to stabilize the cellular and viral proteins. Thus, KSHV can
create a favorable environment for the proliferation and survival
of KSHV-infected host cells using these encoded proteins.

KSHV AND THE 26S PROTEASOME
Proteins conjugated with a K48-linked polyubiquitin chain are
rapidly degraded by the 26S proteasome in an ATP-dependent
manner (Figure 1B). Attachment of a chain composed of four or
more ubiquitins is required for 26S proteasome-mediated protein
degradation. The 26S proteasome consists of the 19S regulatory
complex (19RP) and the 20S proteasome (Ciechanover, 2005;
Weissman et al., 2011). The 20S proteasome is arranged as a stack
of four rings, two outer α rings and two inner β rings, that have
trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and caspase-like proteolytic activ-
ities. The 19S RP can bind to a polyubiquitinated protein through
the S5a/Rpn10 subunit, detach the polyubiquitin chain through
the action of the Rpn11 subunit, and unfold the substrate and
move it into the 20S proteasome for degradation. In the case
of the globular proteins, the substrate undergoes ATP-dependent
unfolding by the association with the 19S ATPases, followed by
translocation into the entrance opening of the 20S proteasome.
Finally, peptides ranging in length from 10 to 25 amino acid
residues emerge from the 20S proteasome.

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus dysregulates cellular
antiviral responses in various ways: (1) downregulation of MHC-I
molecules, (2) suppression of the IFN response by IRF7 degrada-
tion, and (3) inhibition of the proteasomal processing process
needed for antigen production. Virus-infected cells are recog-
+
nized by CD8
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) upon display
of virus-derived peptides by MHC-I. These virus-derived pep-
tides are generated by the 26S proteasome, and then the viral
peptides are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum where
they form a complex with MHC-I, with the assistance of pep-
tide transporters (TAP) and chaperones. In particular, it is known
that EBV prevents antigen presentation by inhibiting the 26S pro-
teasome. EBV-encoded EBNA1 is required for the maintenance
of EBV genomes. Furthermore, EBNA1 blocks the ability of the
26S proteasome to produce antigenic peptides (Levitskaya et al.,
1995). EBNA1 is separated into N- and C-terminal domains by a
Gly-Ala repeat domain, which disturbs the presentation of EBNA1
epitopes to MHC-I and also inhibits EBNA1 mRNA translation,
thus minimizing protein levels in infected cells (Yin et al., 2003).
EBNA1 is thus protected from endogenous presentation through
the MHC-I pathway and this is also likely to be responsible for the
long half-life of the EBNA1 protein. KSHV-encoded LANA, like
EBNA1, may contribute to disturbing the antigen presentation by
inhibition of the 26S proteasome activity. In fact, LANA also func-
tions as a cis-acting inhibitor of antigen presentation (Zaldumbide
et al., 2007). LANA has no sequence homology to EBNA1 but

is apparently functionally analogous. LANA is a 220 kDa protein
with unique N- and C-terminal regions separated by an acidic cen-
tral repeat (CR) region, which contains three sets of repeats that
are rich in Asp and Glu, Pro and Gln, and Pro and Glu, respec-
tively. The CR region does not contain any proteolytic site for the
proteasome. The LANA CR region can be further subdivided into
three subdomains, based on differences in amino acid (aa) repeat
sequences: CR1 (aa 321–428 in ORF73 of the BC-1 sequence, CR2
(aa 430–768), and CR3 (aa 769–937). It is known that the subdo-
main containing CR2CR3 contributes to LANA stability in vitro
and in vivo and also retards LANA protein synthesis, minimizing
LANA protein levels (Kwun et al., 2007). A recent study showed
that the LANA CR1 subdomain inhibited MHC-I peptide antigen
presentation in cis (Kwun et al., 2011). The CR2 subdomains retard
LANA proteasomal processing but do not inhibit LANA peptide
processing by MHC-I. These ﬁndings suggest that LANA physi-
cally inhibits the proteasome by insertion of the repeats into the
proteolytic core particle of the 26S proteasome; however, KSHV
and EBV use different mechanisms to evade host CTL-dependent
surveillance.

KSHV AND E3 UBIQUITIN LIGASES
VIRAL PROTEINS AS COMPONENTS OF E3 UBIQUITIN LIGASES
Various combinations of E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligases determine
the speciﬁcity toward target proteins and the types of ubiquitin
linkages of the polyubiquitin chains. It is believed that there are
in excess of 1000 different ubiquitin ligases in our genomes. E3
ubiquitin ligases are a large family of proteins that can be classiﬁed
into three major and structurally distinct types: (1) HECT-type,
(2) RING-ﬁnger-type, and (3) U-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligases
(Pickart, 2001; Weissman et al., 2011). HECT-type E3s directly
bind the substrate and contain a HECT domain that binds E2 and
catalyzes the ubiquitin ligation (Figure 2A). Ubiquitin is trans-
ferred from the E2 to an active-site cysteine residue within the
HECT domain, forming an E3 ubiquitin thioester complex. Ubiq-
uitin is then transferred to the target protein. In humans, there are
more than 50 kinds of HECT-type E3 enzymes. E6AP was the ﬁrst
HECT-type E3 identiﬁed, and this protein mediates K48-linked
polyubiquitination of p53 in cells that express the E6 of human
papillomavirus (HPV), types 16 and 18. The HPV E6 protein
forms a complex with cellular E6AP, and increases the afﬁn-
ity for p53. RING-ﬁnger-type E3s contain RING-ﬁnger domains
that interact with E2. RING-ﬁnger-type E3s can be sub-classiﬁed
into monomeric RING-ﬁnger E3s (Figure 2B) and multimeric
complex RING-ﬁnger E3s (Figure 2C), such as SCF and ECS
(Lipkowitz and Weissman, 2011). RING-ﬁnger-type E3s func-
tion primarily as scaffolds, orienting the E2-ubiquitin thioester
complex and the target protein for ubiquitin transfer. Mdm2
(Figure 2B-2) is monomeric RING-ﬁnger E3 for K48-linked
polyubiquitination of p53 in normal cells. Multimeric RING-
ﬁnger E3s [also called Cullin (Cul)-based E3s] constitute the
largest subfamily and include the SKP1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF)
complex, the elongin C-elongin B-Cul5-SOCS-box (ECS) com-
plex, and the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C).
The SCF complex (Figure 2C-4) is composed of Skp1 (adaptor
protein), Cul1 (scaffold protein), Rbx1/Roc1 (E2-binding protein),
and F-box protein. F-box protein, classiﬁed into Fbw (β-TrCP and

for the K48-linked polyubiquitination of p53 in normal cells. (B-3) K3 and K5

degradation in lysosomes. (C-4) The SCF complex consists of Skp1
(adaptor protein), Cul1 (scaffold protein), Rbx1/Roc1 (E2-binding protein),

and F-box protein that binds to Skp1 and recognizes the substrate. (C-5)
The ECS complex is composed of elongin B, elongin C, Cul5, Rbx2, and
substrate receptor SOCS-box protein. ECV is composed of elongin B,

LANA functions as a SOCS-box-like protein in the ECS/ECV complex,
consisting of elongin B, elongin C, Cul5, and Rbx1. LANA SOCS-box-like
motif consists of an elongin B/C box (N-terminus) and a Cul box
(C-terminus). LANA binds to p53 protein through its C-terminus and binds
to VHL protein through its N-terminus. (C-7) The human homolog of
Drosophila Siah-1 has a RING-ﬁnger domain to bind E2 and forms an E3
complex composed of SIP, Skp1, and Ebi that recognizes β-catenin. Siah-1
binds to APC and this binding promotes degradation of β-catenin.

Fbw7), Fbl (Skp2), and Fbx types, binds through its F-box motif
to Skp1 and recognizes the substrate. The F-box protein also binds
to Skp1, which can link the F-box protein to Cul1. Cul1 functions
as a scaffold, binding the RING-ﬁnger protein, Rbx1, and an E2.
The ECS complex (Figure 2C-5) is composed of elongin B, elon-
gin C, Cul5, Rbx2, and SOCS-box protein. SOCS-box binds to the
Skp1 homologs elongin C and elongin B. ECV consists of Cul2 in
place of Cul5 in ECS, Rbx1 in place of Rbx2 in ECS, and also the
VHL-box protein that binds HIF-1α.

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus proteins may func-
tion as potential components of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes.
Because E3 ubiquitin ligase can directly destabilize target pro-
teins, the cellular polyubiquitin machinery is dysregulated by a
spurious E3 ubiquitin ligase containing viral components. KSHV-
encoded LANA plays an important role in the maintenance of the
KSHV genome, and also contributes to KSHV-associated onco-
genesis through interaction with pRb (Radkov et al., 2000), p53
(Friborg et al., 1999), and GSK-3 (Fujimuro et al., 2003). LANA
also functions as a potential component within the ECV/ECS com-
plex, and targets the tumor suppressor, VHL, and p53 protein
for polyubiquitination (Cai et al., 2006). LANA contains a puta-
tive SOCS-box motif, which is necessary for its assembly into the
Rbx1-Cul5-elongin B-elongin C complex (Figure 2C-6). LANA

binds to p53 protein through its C-terminus and binds to VHL
protein through its N-terminus. VHL protein, a component of
ECV, functions as a receptor for hydroxylated HIF-1α and induces
K48-linked polyubiquitination of HIF-1α (Figure 2C-5). The
oxygen-sensitive transcription factor, HIF-1α (or HIF-2α), binds
to hypoxia-responsive DNA promoters involved in angiogenesis
and cell proliferation. During normoxia, hydroxylated HIF-1α and
2α are recognized by VHL protein, resulting in their polyubiqui-
tination and degradation. LANA stabilizes HIF-1α and increases
HIF-1α-dependent transactivation by down-regulating VHL pro-
tein. Thus, LANA directly serves as a substrate receptor in ECS
to promote degradation of the VHL and p53. It is known that
multiple KSHV proteins, apart from LANA, are involved in p53
polyubiquitination for proteasomal degradation. KSHV encodes
viral IFN regulatory factor 4 (vIRF4) that binds Mdm2, leading to
the proteasomal degradation of p53 in KSHV-infected cells (Lee
et al., 2009). The central region of vIRF4 interacts with MDM2,
leading to inhibition of MDM2 autoubiquitination and, thereby,
increased MDM2 stability. Moreover, KSHV-encoded vIRF1 also
contributes to destabilizing the protein level of p53 by manipu-
lating ATM kinase, which is activated by DNA damage. ATM can
phosphorylate the Ser15 residues of p53, and this phosphorylation
inhibits the interaction with Mdm2, resulting in p53 stabilization.

The ubiquitin system and KSHV

However, vIRF1 suppresses Ser15 phosphorylation of p53 by ATM,
resulting in an increase of p53 ubiquitination and degradation by
the proteasome (Shin et al., 2006).

Replication and transcription activator, a key regulator for
KSHV reactivation from latent to lytic infection, may function
as a E3 ubiquitin ligase for IRF7. In concert with UbcH5α as an E2
enzyme, RTA mediates the polyubiquitination of IRF7 depending
on its Cys/His-rich domain, resulting in proteasomal degradation
of IRF7 (Yu et al., 2005). RTA also autoregulates its own polyu-
biquitination and stability. The Cys/His-rich domain in the RTA
N-terminal region is not categorized into a RING-ﬁnger domain
and is composed of six Cys and one His residues (Cys3HisCys3).
RAUL, a HECT-type E3, mediates polyubiquitination of IRF7 and
IRF3. It is known that RTA induces the stabilization of RAUL and
enhances the ability of RAUL to degrade IRF7 and IRF3 (Yu and
Hayward, 2010). Furthermore, RTA induces the downregulation of
“Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing
beta-interferon” (TRIF; Ahmad et al., 2011), the cellular transcrip-
tional repressor, Hey1 (Gould et al., 2009), and K-RBP (KSHV RTA
binding protein)/human hypothetical protein MGC2663 (Yang
et al., 2008). RTA interacts with Hey1 and K-RBP, and RTA medi-
ates polyubiquitination, dependent on the Cys/His-rich domain
of RTA, resulting in proteasomal degradation, while the Cys/His-
rich domain of RTA is partially necessary for TRIF degradation,
and RTA-mediated degradation of TRIF is partially mediated
through the ubiquitin system. Thus, RTA manipulates the sta-
bilities of various cellular proteins to dysregulate innate immunity
and transcriptional regulation. However, it remains to be deter-
mined whether RTA Cys/His-rich domain directly binds E2. It is
not known what kind of signal, such as protein–protein inter-
action, conformational switch or post-transcriptional modiﬁca-
tion of the substrate, is necessary to trigger interaction between
RTA and it’s substrates. These issues are of great importance
to many researchers and are expected to be resolved in future
studies.

K3 AND K5
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus has elaborate machiner-
ies to escape innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses.
KSHV establishes a life-long infection in healthy human hosts,
and it is fundamentally important for KSHV to evade the host
immune response. KSHV thus exploits the cellular ubiquitin sys-
tem by providing its own viral E3 enzymes. KSHV-encoded K3
and K5 proteins (Figure 2B-3), a class of viral RING-CH-ﬁnger
E3 ubiquitin ligases, also called the “membrane-associated RING-
CH” (MARCH) family E3 ubiquitin ligases, can downregulate the
cellular surface display of MHC-I proteins, by inducing endo-
cytosis (Brander et al., 2000; Coscoy and Ganem, 2000; Ishido
et al., 2000a). Furthermore, K3 and K5 both target γ-interferon
receptor 1 (IFN-γR1) and induce its ubiquitination, endocytosis,
and degradation, resulting in downregulation of IFN-γR1 surface
expression (Li et al., 2007). K3 and K5 proteins exhibit 40% amino
acid homology to each other and localize to the plasma membrane.
The RING-CH domains in their cytosolic N-termini are respon-
sible for polyubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail region of the
MHC-I protein, and the two transmembrane regions are required
for recognizing MHC-I. K3 and K5-mediated polyubiquitination

of MHC-I leads to rapid internalization of MHC-I from the cell
surface and subsequent endolysosomal degradation.

The RING-CH domain of K5 interacts with UbcH5a as an E2
enzyme (Coscoy et al., 2001), which is involved in K63-, K11-,
and K48-linked polyubiquitination (Bosanac et al., 2011). K5 also
downregulates other cell surface molecules, such as natural killer
cell activators ICAM-1, B7-2 (Ishido et al., 2000b; Coscoy and
Ganem, 2001), CD1d (Sanchez et al., 2005), MHC class I-related
chain A/MICA (Thomas et al., 2008), HFE (Rhodes et al., 2010),
and CD31/PECAM (Mansouri et al., 2006) by enhancing endocy-
tosis and subsequent endolysosomal degradation, leading to the
escape of infected cells from natural killer cells. K5 also targets
the cytoplasmic tail of tetherin (also known as BST2 and CD317)
for ubiquitination, leading to relocalization of tetherin to endo-
somal compartments (Mansouri et al., 2009; Pardieu et al., 2010).
Tetherin is an interferon-induced antiviral membrane protein that
prevents the release of many enveloped viral particles, including
KSHV and HIV. Thus, K5 contributes to efﬁcient KSHV particle
release by down-regulating tetherin.

K3 mediates the K63-linked polyubiquitination of MHC-I,
which is necessary for the efﬁcient endocytosis and lysosomal
degradation of MHC-I. K3 also mediates MHC-I monoubiqui-
tination, and K3-mediated polyubiquitination through the K63-
linkage requires both UbcH5 and Ubc13 as E2 enzymes for
initiating monoubiquitination and subsequent K63-linked polyu-
biquitination, respectively, of MHC-I (Duncan et al., 2006). Ubc13
has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, such as cell
signaling and DNA repair, and has the ability to catalyze formation
of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on various substrates.

CELLULAR EVENTS MODULATED BY KSHV THROUGH
UBIQUITINATION
SUBSTRATE RECOGNITION BY THE SCF COMPLEX
Many substrates of the 26S proteasome are modiﬁed by the
post-translational modiﬁcation before their K48-linked polyu-
biquitination. E3 ubiquitin ligases strictly recognize the post-
translational modiﬁed forms of the target substrates: several dif-
ferent types of triggers for polyubiquitination – phosphorylation,
proline hydroxylation and glycosylation – function as recognition
signals for E3s. However, it is not clear how KSHV E3s (i.e., K3,
K5, LANA, and RTA) recognize their substrates. There is very lim-
ited information available concerning LANA and RTA substrate
recognition. It is not known what type of post-transcriptional
modiﬁcation of the substrate triggers interaction with LANA or
RTA. Prospective studies are expected to resolve these important
issues. Furthermore, it remains to be determined which amino
acid residue of the substrate is modiﬁed and what type of polyu-
biquitin chain is conjugated with their substrate. These issues are
also expected to be cleared in future studies.

In contrast to KSHV E3s, the substrate recognitions of cellular
SCF-type E3s are well known. Many F-box proteins of SCF-type
E3s can recognize phosphorylated forms of target substrates (Lip-
kowitz and Weissman, 2011). The SCF complex consists of Skp1,
Cul1, Rbx1/Roc1, and F-box protein that binds the substrate
(Figure 2C-4). More than 70 F-box proteins in humans can be
categorized into three types (Figure 3): F-box proteins containing
WD40 repeats domain (Fbw/FBXW), F-box proteins containing

downregulation of cell cycle accelerators, such as c-Myc, c-Jun, and
Notch, whereas SCFSkp2 is involved in downregulation of cell cycle
break molecules, such as p21, p27, p57, and p130. As described
in the next section, KSHV can also promote the phosphorylation
of Thr187 of p27, leading to polyubiquitination of p27. For the
many substrates recognized by the SCF complex, phosphorylation
is required for binding with the respective F-box proteins and for
initiating K48-linked polyubiquitination.

As described previously, the ubiquitin system controls the sta-
bilization of regulatory factors involved in cell signaling pathways,
which serve in the progression of cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis,
and control of the viral life-cycle. It is known that KSHV dysregu-
lates recognition signals for cellular SCF complex E3s and exploits
polyubiquitinating activities of SCF E3s. KSHV manipulates the
upstream regulators of these cell signals in order to utilize cellu-
lar SCF E3s and control cell signalings. By targeting the speciﬁc
recognition signals for the SCF complex – the phosphorylation of
substrates such as IκB, β-catenin, and p27 – KSHV can affect cell
cycle regulation, NF-κB signaling, and Wnt signaling (described
in the following sections).

CELL CYCLE REGULATION
G1-S phase progression is strictly regulated by cyclin-dependent
kinase (Cdk)-cyclin complexes. The cyclin D-Cdk4 (or Cdk6) and
cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes phosphorylate pRb from mid-G1 to the
late-G1 stage. These pRb phosphorylations lead to release, and
activate E2F for the S phase progression. Cdk inhibitors (CKIs),
negative-regulators of cyclin-Cdk complexes, can be classiﬁed into
the Cip/Kip family (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2) and the INK4
family (p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d). Cip/Kip
family proteins bind cyclin-Cdk complexes, leading to inhibition
of Cdk activity, and are targeted for K48-linked polyubiquitination
by SCFSkp2 complex E3 (Nakayama and Nakayama, 2006).

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus mimics and uses these
regulatory factors. KSHV v-cyclin/ORF72, a human cyclin D2
homolog, interacts with and activates Cdk4 and Cdk6 to achieve
phosphorylation of pRb and cellular cyclin D, leading to G1-S
phase progression (Chang et al., 1996; Mittnacht and Boshoff,
2000; Järviluoma and Ojala, 2006). Interestingly, unlike the cellu-
lar cyclins, v-cyclin-Cdk complex is resistant to the CKIs, p21, p27,
and p16 (Swanton et al., 1997), and this complex thus functions as a
constitutively active kinase. The v-cyclin-Cdk6 complex phospho-
rylates p21 on Ser130, and this phosphorylated p21 cannot inhibit
Cdk2 (Järviluoma et al., 2006). Furthermore, v-cyclin-Cdk6 com-
plex interacts with p27 and phosphorylates p27 at Thr187, leading
to polyubiquitination of p27 for degradation (Ellis et al., 1999;
Mann et al., 1999; Järviluoma et al., 2004). This regulation of p27
is normally performed by cellular cyclin E-Cdk2. Skp2 F-box pro-
tein of SCFSkp2 complex can bind Thr187-phosphorylated p27 and
mediates its modiﬁcation with a K48-linked polyubiquitin chain
(Figure 3), leading to its degradation.

NOTCH SIGNALING
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded proteins manip-
ulate upstream regulators in cell signaling and exploit the ubiquitin
system to alter the stabilization of target proteins. Furthermore,
KSHV proteins can directly bind a component of E3 ubiquitin

FIGURE 3 | Molecular diversity of SCF E3 complexes. The SCF complex
consists of Skp1, Cul1, Rbx1 (E2-binding protein), and F-box protein that
binds Skp1 and recognizes the substrate. There are more than 70 F-box
proteins in humans and the F-box protein decides the substrate speciﬁcity
of SCF. F-box proteins can be categorized into three types: F-box proteins
containing a WD40-repeat domain (Fbw), F-box proteins containing a
leucine-rich-repeat domain (Fbl), and F-box proteins containing other
domains “X” (Fbx). Each F-box protein binds the phosphorylated consensus
sequence of the speciﬁc substrate, resulting in K48-linked
polyubiquitination.

leucine-rich repeats domain (Fbl/FBXL), and F-box proteins con-
taining other domains (Fbx/FBXO; Nakayama and Nakayama,
2006). The SCFβTrCP complex, containing β-TrCP/Fbw1 as the
Fbw-type F-box protein, binds to cellular signaling regulators, such
as β-catenin, NF-κB inhibitors (IκBα, β, ε), ATF4, Snail, DIG1,
Cdc25, and Wee1A. β-TrCP recognizes the conserved DpSGXXpS
motif (with phosphorylated serine residues) in the substrate. The
phosphorylation of Ser32 and Ser36 of IκBα is necessary for bind-
ing of β-TrCP, and the phosphorylation of Ser33 and Ser37 of
β-catenin is necessary for binding of β-TrCP. As described in the
following sections, KSHV can promote these phosphorylations of
IκBα and β-catenin in order to up-regulate NF-κB and Wnt sig-
naling. The SCFFbw7 complex, containing Fbw7 as the Fbw-type
F-box protein, recognizes c-Myc, c-Jun, Notch-1, Notch-4, cyclin E,
and presenilin. The SCFSkp2 complex, containing Skp2/Fbl1 as the
Fbl-type F-box protein, recognizes p21, p27, p57, p130, cyclin A, -
D, -E, E2F, Foxo1, Orc1, and Cdk9. SCFFbw7 complex is involved in

ligases to inhibit the E3 activity for polyubiquitination, leading to
stabilization of target substrates. The SCFFbw7 complex (Figure 3)
is composed of Fbw7 as an F-box protein, which recognizes and
binds the intracellular regions of Notch-1, -3, and -4 (Nakayama
and Nakayama, 2006; Matsumoto et al., 2011). The F-box protein
Fbw7, also known as Sel-10 in C. elegans and hCDC4 in humans, is
thus a critical component of SCFFbw7, while it is a negative regula-
tor of Notch signaling. Notch signaling plays roles in cell fate deci-
sions, proliferation, and differentiation. When a Notch ligand, such
as Jagged or Delta, binds the Notch receptor, a γ-secretase com-
plex, including presenilin, cleaves the intramembrane region of the
Notch receptor, Notch-1, 2, 3, and 4, resulting in release of intra-
cellular Notch (ICN, also called the Notch intracellular domain,
NICD). ICN, which functions as a transcriptional activator, enters
the nucleus and binds“CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1”(CSL),
upregulating transcription of its targets (Hayward et al., 2006).

It is known that, in addition to ICN, KSHV RTA interacts with
CSL and activates target gene expression in cooperation with co-
activators (Liang and Ganem, 2003). KSHV also has another way
to activate Wnt signaling. KSHV LANA binds Fbw7/Sel-10, a com-
ponent of SCFFbw7, to inhibit polyubiquitination of intracellular
Notch-1 (ICN), which leads to stabilization of ICN. The carboxyl-
terminus of LANA binds the F-box domain and the WD40 domain
of Fbw7/Sel-10, whereas it competes with ICN for interaction with
Fbw7/Sel-10, resulting in inhibition of ICN polyubiquitination
and degradation (Lan et al., 2007). Stabilization of ICN by LANA
is also related to the proliferation of KSHV-infected cells.

NF-κB SIGNALING
NF-κB signaling, regulated by the ubiquitin system, inﬂuences
cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and inﬂammation. KSHV acti-
vates NF-κB pathways to promote host cell proliferation, sur-
vival, and angiogenesis. Additionally, constitutive activation of
NF-κB signaling is essential for latent infection of KSHV and
survival in KSHV-infected PEL cells. In normal resting cells, the
canonical NF-κB signaling pathway is suppressed by IκBα pro-
tein. The NF-κB pathway is further regulated by IKK complex,
consisting of IKKα, β, and a scaffold subunit (IKKγ/NEMO).
A stimulus, such as TNF-α or IL-1β,
induces activation of
the IKK complex via TRAF6 and TRAF2. TRAF6 can modify
NEMO by K63-linked polyubiquitination, in collaboration with
Ubc13. K63-linked polyubiquitinated NEMO then activates the
IKK complex, which phosphorylates IκBα. Phosphorylation of
Ser32 and Ser36 IκBα can be a trigger for K48-linked polyu-
biquitination by SCFβTrCP (Figure 3). Phosphorylated IκBα is
then subjected to SCFβTrCP-mediated K48-linked polyubiquiti-
nation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This releases
active NF-κB (p50–p65/RelA heterodimer). There is another
upregulation system for IKK complex: TGF-β-activated kinase
(TAK1) also phosphorylates and activates IKK. TAK1 forms a
complex with TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) and TAB2 (or
TAB3). TAB2 stimulates TAK1 kinase activity and binds to K63-
linked polyubiquitinated NEMO (or TRAF6) through the Zn-
ﬁnger domain of TAB2. In response to TNF-α stimuli, receptor-
interacting protein (RIP) is modiﬁed with K63-linked polyubiq-
uitin chain, and polyubiquitinated RIP recruits NEMO into the
IKK complex.

(cid:2)

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded v-FLIP, K7,
and microRNA can induce NF-κB transcriptional activation by
targeting the protein level of IκB. v-FLIP (ORF 71) achieves anti-
apoptosis by activating NF-κB signaling (Chaudhary et al., 1999;
Keller et al., 2000; Chugh et al., 2005). v-FLIP can activate the IKK
complex through interaction with NEMO of the IKK complex,
including Hsp90 (Field et al., 2003) and RIP (Chaudhary et al.,
1999; Liu et al., 2002). Additionally, TRAF2 leads to the associa-
tion of v-FLIP with the NEMO of the IKK complex (Guasparri
et al., 2006). Activated IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα, leading
to K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
miR-K1 of the miRNA cluster, encoded by the KSHV genome, can
decrease IκBα in a ubiquitin system-independent manner. miR-
K1 reduces expression of IκBα protein by targeting the 3
-UTR
of its transcript (Lei et al., 2010). Thus, miR-K1 upregulates NF-
κB activity and inhibits viral lytic replication in PEL cells. KSHV
small membrane protein, K7, inhibits caspase-3-induced apoptosis
and interacts with ubiquitin/PLIC1 (Feng et al., 2004). Ubiquilin
has an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and a C-terminal
ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. The UBA domain binds
to the K7 protein and the polyubiquitin chain. The interaction
between K7 and ubiquilin induces the degradation of IκB and
concomitant activation of NF-κB signaling. Thus, to activate the
NF-κB pathway, KSHV may induce the phosphorylation of IκBα
for SCFβTrCP-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitination, resulting
in reduced IκBα protein. Interestingly, K7 induces the degrada-
tion of KSHV-encoded ORF74/vGPCR, which is a pirated version
of the human IL-8 receptor gene. vGPCR is a ligand-independent,
constitutively active signaling molecule that activates NF-κB sig-
naling and promotes cell proliferation. K7 causes vGPCR to be
retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and induces the proteaso-
mal degradation of vGPCR. Furthermore, K7 expression reduces
vGPCR tumorigenicity in nude mice (Feng et al., 2008).

Wnt SIGNALING
The Wnt signaling pathway, also regulated by ubiquitin and the
proteasome, is involved in several key developmental processes
and in tumorigenesis. The Wnt signaling cascade is triggered when
Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled receptors and the signal is transmitted
through Disheveled to the axin-APC-GSK-3β complex, resulting
in the disruption of this complex. The β-catenin level is regu-
lated by GSK-3β (GSK-3), Ser/Thr kinase, which phosphorylates
β-catenin and targets it for K48-linked polyubiquitination and,
subsequently, proteasomal degradation. Displacement of GSK-
3 from the complex leads to stabilization of β-catenin, which
translocates to the nucleus and forms a complex with Lef (or
Tcf4) transcription factors, stimulating the expression of c-Myc,
c-Jun, and cyclin D1. Phosphorylation of β-catenin is essen-
tial for binding SCFβTrCP complex, containing the β-TrCP that
recognizes the DpSGXXpS motif in β-catenin. SCFβTrCP com-
plex can mediate K48-linked polyubiquitination for β-catenin
(Figure 3). GSK-3 kinase recognizes and phosphorylates serine
and/or threonine residues in the context of the S/Txxx pS/pT
motif. The downstream Ser or Thr residue must ﬁrst be phos-
phorylated by a priming kinase. In β-catenin, phosphorylation of
Ser45 by casein kinase I serves as the priming event for GSK-3
kinase, which then phosphorylates the Thr41, Ser37, and Ser33

residues. Phosphorylation of Ser33 and Ser37 of β-catenin is
necessary for binding of the SCFβTrCP complex and K48-linked
polyubiquitination.

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus dysregulates Wnt sig-
naling by LANA (Fujimuro and Hayward, 2003; Fujimuro et al.,
2003, 2005). The β-catenin protein accumulates in latently KSHV-
infected PEL cells and KS cells. The mechanism of β-catenin dys-
regulation is related to the interaction of LANA and GSK-3 kinase.
LANA associates with GSK-3, leading to nuclear translocation of
GSK-3. Although GSK-3 is localized primarily in the cytoplasm,
a small proportion of GSK-3 is known to enter the nucleus dur-
ing S phase (Diehl et al., 1998), and LANA increases the number
of cells in S phase (Fujimuro et al., 2003). Because LANA binds
to nuclear GSK-3, LANA induces depletion of cytoplasmic GSK-
3. In the absence of cytoplasmic GSK-3, β-catenin accumulates
in the cytoplasm and enters the nucleus to stimulate transcrip-
tional activation of downstream target genes. Additionally, LANA
binds ERK1/2, which participates in the phosphorylation of Ser
9 of GSK-3, resulting in inactivation of GSK-3 (Liu et al., 2007).
The stability of c-Myc is regulated by the c-Myc phosphorylation
at Ser62, mediated by Erk, and at Thr58, mediated by GSK-3.
This phosphorylation of c-Myc is necessary for the interaction
with Fbw7 protein of SCFFbw7 and K48-linked polyubiquitination
(Yada et al., 2004). Inactivation of nuclear GSK-3 by LANA may
increase the stability and activity of c-Myc and further contribute
to LANA-mediated growth dysregulation. In fact, abnormally sta-
ble c-Myc protein can be observed, and LANA is responsible for
this stability in PEL cells (Bubman et al., 2007).

EBV upregulates Wnt signaling through a different mechanism
than that in KSHV (Hayward et al., 2006). EBV LMP1 represses
expression of the transcripts for Siah-1 (Jang et al., 2005), the
human homolog of Drosophila seven in absentia. Siah-1 binds E2
enzyme with its N-terminal RING-ﬁnger domain and forms an E3
ubiquitin ligase complex, consisting of Siah-1, SIP, Skp1, and Ebi
that binds the β-catenin protein (Figure 2C-7). This E3 ubiquitin
ligase promotes the degradation of β-catenin through a mecha-
nism independent of GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation; Siah-1
binds to APC and this binding directly promotes degradation of
β-catenin. On the other hand, an E3 complex including Siah-1
targets KSHV protein for polyubiquitination. The KSHV-encoded
ORF45 protein is capable of inhibiting virus-dependent interferon
induction and appears to be essential for both early and late stages
of infection. Siah-1 complex induces the destabilization of ORF45
protein through polyubiquitination (Abada et al., 2008).

KSHV AND DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME
Polyubiquitination is reversed by the isopeptidase activities of
DUBs. DUBs disassemble polyubiquitin chains from substrates,
resulting in inhibition of the recognition by the 26S proteasome,
and induce stabilization of substrate proteins. It is well known that
human herpesviruses utilize activities of DUBs for stabilization of
their viral proteins. DUBs disassemble polyubiquitin chains from
polyubiquitinated proteins, resulting in stabilization of substrate
proteins.

USP7 (also called HAUSP) is an evolutionary-conserved mam-
malian DUB, which was originally identiﬁed as a protein binding
to the EBNA1 of EBV and ICP0 of HSV-1 (Canning et al., 2004;

Holowaty and Frappier, 2004). USP7 can remove the K48-linked
polyubiquitin from the EBNA1 and ICP0, and stabilize them.
Interestingly, recent studies show that KSHV also targets DUBs to
stabilize the cellular and viral proteins needed for viral processes.
KSHV encodes a viral DUB (ORF64) that can disassemble both
K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (González et al., 2009),
while ORF64 protein suppresses RIG-I-mediated IFN signaling
by reducing the polyubiquitination of RIG-I (Inn et al., 2011).
Additionally, RTA targets the USP7 to stabilize the HECT-type
E3, RAUL (Yu and Hayward, 2010). KSHV, directly or indirectly,
may exploit DUBs to stabilize its own proteins and other cellular
proteins involved in its survival and replication in infected cells.

CONCLUSION
Ubiquitination plays a key role in controlling the function and
stability of target proteins. KSHV hijacks the ubiquitin system
and the degradation-by-proteasome system for the purpose of cell
proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and evasion from immune surveil-
lance in infected cells. KSHV-encoded proteins and E3 enzymes
take advantage of cellular ubiquitins and induce the degradation
of host proteins that are antagonistic to infection. KSHV also uti-
lizes the activities of DUBs for stabilization of their viral proteins.
However, there are many questions about these KSHV dysregulat-
ing mechanisms. It remains to be determined how K3, K5, LANA,
and RTA recognize and dock their substrates. Particularly, it is not
known what type of signal (such as post-transcriptional modiﬁca-
tion of the substrate, conformation-changing of substrate, or other
protein interaction with substrate) can trigger interactions with
KSHV E3s. These questions need to be resolved in a future study.
Additionally, a very interesting discovery has been made with RTA
Cys/His-rich domain, which is not categorized into RING-ﬁnger
domain, and which may be a new type of RING-ﬁnger. However,
it is unclear whether or not RTA Cys/His-rich domain binds to
E2. This important question also needs to be answered in a future
study.

With the exception of ubiquitination, several post-translational
modiﬁcations of cellular and viral proteins, such as glycosylation,
methylation, acetylation, sumoylation, and S-nitrosylation, have
been described by numerous studies. Because these modiﬁcations
play critical roles in regulating functions of substrate proteins, we
need to consider these modiﬁcation as well as ubiquitination. Fur-
ther study is expected to reveal how KSHV associates with these
post-translational modiﬁcations.

To further elucidate KSHV pathogenesis, it should be resolved
how KSHV dysregulates and exploits ubiquitin pathways through
advanced proteomic approaches. A better understanding of the
interaction between KSHV infection and the ubiquitin system will
provide new insights into the viral evasion of host immunity and
the process of carcinogenesis triggered by KSHV, and may provide
the basis for theories for the development of novel therapeutic
interventions against KSHV-related cancers.
