The Gram-negative facultative intracellular rod Burkholderia pseudomallei causes melioido-
sis, an infectious disease with a wide range of clinical presentations. Among the observed
visceral abscesses, the liver is commonly affected. However, neither this organotropism of
B. pseudomallei nor local hepatic defense mechanisms have been thoroughly investigated
so far. Own previous studies using electron microscopy of the murine liver after systemic
infection of mice indicated that hepatocytes might be capable of killing B. pseudomallei.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to further elucidate the interaction of B. pseudomallei
with these cells and to analyze the role of hepatocytes in anti-B. pseudomallei host defense.
In vitro studies using the human hepatocyte cell line HepG2 revealed that B. pseudomallei
can invade these cells. Subsequently, B. pseudomallei is able to escape from the vacuole,
to replicate within the cytosol of HepG2 cells involving its type 3 and type 6 secretion sys-
tems, and to induce actin tail formation. Furthermore, stimulation of HepG2 cells showed
that IFNγ can restrict growth of B. pseudomallei
in the early and late phase of infection
whereas the combination of IFNγ, IL-1β, and TNFα is required for the maximal antibacterial
activity. This anti-B. pseudomallei defense of HepG2 cells did not seem to be mediated by
inducible nitric oxide synthase-derived nitric oxide or NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide.
In summary, this is the ﬁrst study describing B. pseudomallei intracellular life cycle char-
acteristics in hepatocytes and showing that IFNγ-mediated, but nitric oxide- and reactive
oxygen species-independent, effector mechanisms are important in anti-B. pseudomallei
host defense of hepatocytes.

INTRODUCTION
The Gram-negative saprophyte Burkholderia pseudomallei is the
causative agent of melioidosis, an emerging infectious disease of
humans and animals in certain areas of the tropics and subtropics.
B. pseudomallei is an intracellular pathogen that can invade a vari-
ety of host cells (Jones et al., 1996). After invasion, B. pseudomallei
can escape from the endocytotic vesicle of murine macrophage
cells into the host cytosol depending on a functional type 3 secre-
tion system-3 (T3SS-3; Stevens et al., 2002; Burtnick et al., 2008;
Muangsombut et al., 2008; Gong et al., 2011). Within the cytosol
bacteria can multiply and induce the BimA-dependent formation
of actin tails, facilitating intracellular motility as well as spread-
ing of B. pseudomallei into neighboring cells (Kespichayawattana
et al., 2000; Breitbach et al., 2003; Stevens et al., 2005). A recent
paper proposed that B. pseudomallei-induced cell fusion and the

formation of multinucleated giant cells represent the primary path
for intercellular spread and plaque formation of this pathogen
(French et al., 2011).

Several reports have shown that interferon γ (IFNγ) is essential
for the early control of B. pseudomallei infection in mice (Santani-
rand et al., 1999; Breitbach et al., 2006). In vitro experiments also
demonstrated a pivotal role for IFNγ to eliminate intracellular B.
pseudomallei in macrophages (Miyagi et al., 1997; Utaisincharoen
et al., 2001). We recently demonstrated that the downstream effec-
tor molecule of IFNγ, nitric oxide (NO), has a dual role among
resistant and susceptible mouse strains after B. pseudomallei infec-
tion. NO had rather detrimental effects in innate resistant C57BL/6
mice in a murine model of melioidosis and was not involved in
killing activity of C57BL/6 macrophages (Breitbach et al., 2006,
2011). In contrast, NO contributed to complete resistance in innate
susceptible BALB/c mice and to growth restriction of B. pseudoma-
llei in macrophages from those mice (Breitbach et al., 2011). In a
previous study we revealed that NADPH oxidase-mediated mech-
anisms contribute to early resistance in bone marrow-derived
macrophages and C57BL/6 mice (Breitbach et al., 2006).

The liver plays an essential role in the innate immune response,
providing the ﬁrst line of defense against microbes crossing the
intestinal barrier (Crispe, 2009). Kupffer cells are important for the
rapid clearance of microorganisms from the systemic circulation,

and can facilitate the generation of a local inﬂammatory response
leading to recruitment of inﬂammatory cells. Furthermore, hepa-
tocytes can also secrete inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines
in response to cytokine activation and/or bacterial invasion (Row-
ell et al., 1997; Santos et al., 2005). However, to date little is known
about the antimicrobial responses of hepatocytes. Only few studies
indicate that IFNγ can restrict growth of Listeria monocytogenes
and Salmonella typhimurium in murine hepatocytes (Gregory and
Wing, 1993; Lajarin et al., 1996).

In previous studies we and others revealed that the organotro-
pism of B. pseudomallei for the spleen and liver in melioidosis
patients can be mimicked by infection of mice (Hoppe et al.,
1999; Santanirand et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2002). Electron micro-
scopic investigations of the murine liver demonstrated that B.
pseudomallei-containing phagosomes in hepatocytes fuse with
lysosomes, leading to bacterial degradation (Hoppe et al., 1999).
Therefore, the present study aimed to establish an in vitro hepato-
cyte infection model with human polarized HepG2 cells to study
host defense mechanisms against B. pseudomallei. We investigated
whether B. pseudomallei is able to invade and survive within hepa-
tocytes and whether bacterial replication is dependent on the
B. pseudomallei type 3 or type 6 secretion systems. Finally, we
addressed the role of cytokines in enhancing anti-B. pseudomallei
activity in HepG2 cells and a possible contribution of nitric oxide
and reactive oxygen species in the bactericidal activity against B.
pseudomallei.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MATERIALS
Cytochalasin D (CytoD), latrunculin B (LatB), jasplakinolide
(Jasp), and nocodazole (Noco) were obtained from Enzo Life
Sciences (Lörrach, Germany). Catalase–polyethylene glycol (CAT–
PEG), superoxide dismutase–polyethylene glycol (SOD–PEG),
N -acetyl-cysteine (NAC), aminoguanidine (AG), and colchicine
(Col) were from Sigma Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany). hIFNγ
was purchased from Miltenyi Biotec GmbH (Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany), and both mIL-1β and mTNFα were from Roche
(Mannheim, Germany). Apocynin (Apo) was obtained from
Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany).

BACTERIAL STRAINS
Burkholderia pseudomallei wild-type strain E8 comprises a soil iso-
late from the surrounding area of Ubon Ratchathani in northeast
Thailand (Wuthiekanun et al., 1996) and was used throughout
the study. T3SS-3 mutant ΔBPSS1539 (16:48) and T6SS-1 mutant
ΔBPSS1509 (5:45) were generated by Tn5-OT182 mutagenesis of
B. pseudomallei E8 as previously described (Pilatz et al., 2006). Bac-
teria were grown on Columbia agar at 37˚C for 24 h and adjusted to
the desired concentration in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline
(D-PBS; Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) or the respective cell
culture medium.

CELL CULTURE AND INFECTION OF HepG2 CELLS
Human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells were obtained
from the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen
und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) sup-
plemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories GmbH,

Cölbe, Germany) at 37˚C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing
95% air and 5% CO2.
Twenty-four hours prior to infection, cells were seeded in 48
well plates (1.5× 105 cells per well), grown to 80% conﬂuence, and
infected with B. pseudomallei strain E8 at the indicated multiplicity
of infection (MOI). For invasion assays well plates were addition-
ally centrifuged for 4 min at 120× g. After infection for 30 min
cells were washed twice with D-PBS and incubated in kanamycin
(250 μg/ml) containing medium to eliminate remaining extracel-
lular bacteria. To minimize re-infection and extracellular replica-
tion the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium containing
125 μg/ml kanamycin 6 h after infection. At indicated time points
(time zero was taken 25 min after incubation under antibiotic-
containing medium) the number of intracellular colony forming
units (CFU) was determined. Consequently, cells were washed
twice with D-PBS and subsequently lysed using 150 μl D-PBS con-
taining 0.5% Tergitol TMN (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) per well. After 15 min of incubation
appropriate dilutions of lysates were plated on Mueller–Hinton
agar and incubated at 37˚C for 48 h.

Activation of HepG2 cells was performed using 500 ng/ml
IFNγ, 50–200 U/ml IL-1β, or 10 ng/ml TNFα 24 h prior to
infection. For in vitro inhibition of inducible nitric oxide syn-
thase (iNOS), NADPH oxidase, or ROS generation, HepG2 cells
were treated by adding 2 mM aminoguanidine (24 h), 500 μM
apocynin, or 20 U/ml superoxide dismutase, 200 U/ml catalase,
and 200 μM N -acetyl-cysteine or corresponding vehicle into
the culture medium 1 h (unless otherwise indicated) prior to
infection and during the incubation with kanamycin-containing
medium. For in vitro inhibition of the actin cytoskeleton or
the microtubules, HepG2 were incubated for 1 h with 1 μM
cytochalasin D, 0.1 μM latrunculin B, 0.5 μM jasplakinolide,
10 μM nocodazole, 5 μM colchicine, or corresponding vehicle,
followed by infection with B. pseudomallei. All inhibitors and
vehicles were kept in the infection medium throughout the
experiment.

IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE STAINING
Twenty-four hours prior to infection, HepG2 cells were seeded on
collagen type I coated cover slips in 24 well plates (2× 105 cells
per well) and infected with B. pseudomallei strain E8 at a MOI
of 400 by centrifugation of the well plates for 4 min at 120× g.
After infection for 30 min cells were washed twice with D-PBS and
incubated in kanamycin (250 μg/ml) containing medium to elim-
inate remaining extracellular bacteria. At indicated time points
HepG2 cells were washed with PBS, incubated for 10 min in ice-
cold methanol, and washed three times with IF buffer [0.2%
(w/v) BSA, 0.05% (w/v) saponin, 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide in
PBS, pH 7.4]. To block non-speciﬁc antibody binding, cells were
incubated for up to 1 h in IF buffer followed by an overnight incu-
bation at 4˚C in a humidity chamber with monoclonal mouse
anti-B. pseudomallei 3015 γ2b (1:2000; Pilatz et al., 2006) and
polyclonal rabbit anti-β-actin (1:100; Cell Signaling, Frankfurt am
Main, Germany) or monoclonal mouse anti-lysosomal-associated
membrane protein-1 (anti-LAMP-1) γ1 (1:400; BD Biosciences,
Heidelberg, Germany) antibodies. After a wash with IF buffer, the
immunoreacted primary antibodies were visualized with green

ﬂuorescent Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG2b (1:800; Invitro-
gen, Darmstadt, Germany) and red ﬂuorescent Cy3-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) or
red ﬂuorescent Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse IgG1 (1:800; Invitro-
gen) by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After
another wash with IF buffer, slices were covered with Fluorprep
(bioMérieux, Nürtingen, Germany) and observed by ﬂuorescent
microscopy with a BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence Corporation,
Neu-Isenburg, Germany).

LDH ASSAY
To quantify the extent of cell damage after infection, release of lac-
tate dehydrogenase (LDH) in cell culture supernatants was deter-
mined. HepG2 cells were seeded in 96 well plates (3.75× 104 cells
per well) and infected at the indicated MOI with B. pseudoma-
llei for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with D-PBS, and 100 μl
of medium containing 250 μg/ml of kanamycin was added to
each well to eliminate extracellular bacteria. At the indicated time
points, cell culture supernatant was collected, and LDH activity
was detected by using the CytoTox-One homogeneous mem-
brane integrity assay (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, 50 μl of supernatant
was added to the kit reagent and incubated for 10 min. After
addition of stopping solution, the ﬂuorescence intensity was mea-
sured using the microplate reader Inﬁnite M200 PRO (Tecan,
Crailsheim, Germany) at excitation wavelength of 560 nm and
emission wavelength of 590 nm.

REAL-TIME CELL ANALYSIS
HepG2 cells were seeded in 96 well E-plates (3× 104 cells per
well), grown for 24 h, and then infected at the indicated MOI with
B. pseudomallei for 30 min followed by incubation in kanamycin
(250 μg/ml) containing medium. Cellular events were monitored
in real-time using the xCELLigence system according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The system
measures electrical impedance across gold microelectrodes inte-
grated into the bottom of tissue culture E-plates providing real-
time, quantitative information about the biological status of the
cells, including cell number, viability, morphology, and degree of
cell adhesion. In the absence of cells on the electrode surface, the
electrical impedance describes only the background. Changes in
impedance are dependent on either the number of cells attached
to the electrodes or the dimensional change of attached cells on
the electrode surface. The xCELLigence system detects changes
in impedance and calculates them as dimensionless parameter

termed Cell Index: CI= (Z i − Z 0)/15 where Z i is the impedance
at an individual time point of the experiment and Z 0 describes
the background measurement at the beginning of the experiment.
To evaluate the impact of B. pseudomallei on HepG2 cells, the
normalized cell index (NCIti) was used. Consequently, all selected
wells were set on impedance value of 1 at a given time point (time
of infection), and all further values were calculated as the cell
index at a given time point (CIti) divided by the Cell Index at the
normalization time point (CInml_time).

DATA PRESENTATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Figures and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad
Prism, version 4.0. Student’s t -test was used to detect statistically

signiﬁcant differences in the intracellular bacterial numbers.
p-Values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
BURKHOLDERIA PSEUDOMALLEI IS ABLE TO INVADE AND REPLICATE
WITHIN HepG2 CELLS
The invasion and intracellular replication of B. pseudomallei in
hepatocytes or hepatocyte cell lines has not been investigated so
far. Therefore, we ﬁrst investigated the invasion and the course of
the intracellular bacterial burden in human hepatocellular carci-
noma HepG2 cells after infection with B. pseudomallei wild-type
strain E8 at a MOI of 29 and 599, respectively. As shown in
Figure 1A, B. pseudomallei was able to enter HepG2 cells. Within
the ﬁrst 3 h after infection, a strong reduction in Burkholderia
counts could be observed which indicates that effective bacterici-
dal defense mechanisms are activated in HepG2 cells in the early
phase of infection. Six hours after infection the intracellular bac-
terial burden increased, suggesting that B. pseudomallei is able to
multiply within cells. After 24 h 10-fold more bacteria were found
in Burkholderia-infected HepG2 cells compared to the beginning.
To provide some information about the mechanism used by B.
pseudomallei to enter HepG2 cells, we analyzed the role of the host
actin cytoskeleton as well as microtubules by using well deﬁned
inhibitors. As shown in Figure 1B, there was a tendency of actin
cytoskeleton inhibitors (1 μM cytochalasin D, 0.1 μM latrunculin
B, 0.5 μM jasplakinolide) as well as microtubule inhibitors (10 μM
nocodazole, 5 μM colchicine) to reduce invasion of B. pseudo-
mallei, as determined by enumeration of intracellular bacteria,
although statistical signiﬁcance was not reached. Therefore, our
results indicate that the host actin cytoskeleton may contribute
to B. pseudomallei uptake in HepG2 cells, but other invasion
mechanisms may also play an important role.

As B. pseudomallei type 3 and type 6 secretion systems (T3SS,
T6SS) are important for invasion of murine macrophages or
human epithelial cells as well as for intracellular survival (Stevens
et al., 2002, 2003; Burtnick et al., 2011), we analyzed whether
they are also involved in the replication of B. pseudomallei in
hepatocytes. Consequently, HepG2 cells were infected with B.
pseudomallei wild-type strain E8, as well as a type 3 (ΔBPSS1539)
and type 6 (ΔBPSS1509) secretion mutant, which have previ-
ously been shown to be attenuated in vivo (Pilatz et al., 2006).
Surprisingly, mutant ΔBPSS1509, but not ΔBPSS1539 revealed a
signiﬁcantly higher invasion in HepG2 cells compared to the wild-
type strain (Figure 1C). However, 24 h postinfection intracellular
CFU counts were at least one log lower in cells infected with both
mutant strains than in those infected with the wild-type strain.
These results suggest that B. pseudomallei can infect and replicate
in human hepatocytes and that the T3SS and T6SS contribute to
optimal replication.

BURKHOLDERIA PSEUDOMALLEI CAN ESCAPE FROM THE VACUOLE
AND INDUCE FORMATION OF ACTIN TAILS IN HepG2 CELLS
To further characterize the hepatocyte–pathogen-interaction
we examined the intracellular localization of B. pseudomallei
wild-type, T3SS, and T6SS mutant strains in HepG2 cells rela-
tive to LAMP-1 containing vacuoles as well as actin tail formation.
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy revealed that 8 h after infection

the wild-type was rarely seen co-localized with regions of LAMP-
1 staining (Figure 2A), however a part of the B. pseudomallei
population was able to induce actin tails (data not shown). Six-
teen hours after infection the majority of bacteria displayed long
actin tails (Figure 2B). In contrast, T3SS mutant ΔBPSS1539 was
almost exclusively observed in association with LAMP-1, suggest-
ing that the mutant is unable to escape from endocytotic vesicles
8 h after infection (Figure 2A). In accordance with our recent
study using HeLa cells (Pilatz et al., 2006) this mutant was still
able to multiply within the phagosomes of HepG2 cells, leading to
large vesicles ﬁlled with bacteria. As B. pseudomallei was trapped
within the phagosomes, no actin tail formation could be observed
at this time point (data not shown). However, 16 h after infec-
tion some of these huge vacuoles seemed to become leaky and B.
pseudomallei ΔBPSS1539 could be detected within the cytosol in
association with actin tails (Figure 2B). As the wild-type the T6SS
mutant ΔBPSS1509 was rarely seen associated with LAMP-1 8 h
after infection, but actin tails could not be detected at this time
point (data not shown). However, 16 h after infection the mutant
was able to induce actin tails, but to a lesser degree compared to
the wild-type (data not shown).

BURKHOLDERIA PSEUDOMALLEI INFECTION INDUCES CELL DAMAGE
OF HepG2 CELLS
To determine whether B. pseudomallei affects the viability of
hepatocytes, cytosolic LDH activity was measured in cell culture
supernatants of infected and control HepG2 cells at 24 h postinfec-
tion as an indicator of cytotoxicity. Figure 3A demonstrates that
infection of HepG2 cells with B. pseudomallei wild-type strain E8
induced only a small MOI-dependent release of LDH compared
to uninfected cells. However, this slight cytotoxicity was not found

FIGURE 1 | Burkholderia pseudomallei can multiply in human

multiplicities of infection of 29:1 (opened circles) and 599:1 (closed circles),
and cells were lysed at different time points after infection to determine the
number of viable intracellular bacteria by plating lysates on Mueller–Hinton
agar. (B) Invasion of B. pseudomallei in HepG2 cells at a MOI of ∼400:1 in

0.5 μM) as well as inhibitors of microtubules, including nocodazole (Noco,
10 μM) and colchicine (Col, 5 μM). Invasion of B. pseudomallei in the
absence of an inhibitor was set to 100%. (C) HepG2 cells were infected
with either B. pseudomallei wild-type (WT), T3SS-3 mutant ΔBPSS1539, or
T6SS-1 mutant ΔBPSS1509 using a MOI of ∼40:1, and intracellular
replication was monitored as above. Data are presented as mean with SEM
of triplicate determinations. One representative experiment out of three
independent experiments is shown. Statistical analyses were performed
using a Student’s t-test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

to be mediated by activation of apoptotic caspases 3 and 9 using
Western blot analysis (data not shown).

Since B. pseudomallei infection led to detachment of hepato-
cytes after 24 h in a MOI-dependent manner as determined by
microscopic analyses (data not shown), we aimed to quantify
these cellular damages by performing electrical impedance mea-
surements providing real-time information about the biological
status of hepatocytes such as viability, morphology, and degree of
cell adhesion. Such an experimental approach has recently been
described for meningococcal infection in human brain microvas-
cular endothelial cells (Slanina et al., 2011). HepG2 cells were
grown for 24 h leading to an increase of the Normalized Cell
Index (Figure 3B). Infection with B. pseudomallei wild-type strain
E8 at MOI of 37 or 350 resulted in a transient decrease of the
corresponding Cell Index caused by the cell culture medium
exchange. Due to the proliferation and spreading of hepatocytes,
non-infected cells led to enhanced electrical impedance within
110 h. In contrast, infection of HepG2 cells with B. pseudoma-
llei at a MOI of 37 resulted in a loss of electrical impedance 36 h
after infection, whereas infection at a MOI of 350 led to a loss of
electrical impedance already 24 h postinfection (Figure 3B), corre-
lating with the low LDH release after 24 h (Figure 3A). To exclude
that the impedance was inﬂuenced by bacterial overload of the
electrodes, electrical impedance was investigated in response to
bacterial growth over the same period. However, no effect on the
Cell Index could be observed when bacteria alone were grown in
the wells (data not shown).

To determine whether reduced intracellular growth of T3SS
and T6SS mutants correlates with an increased viability of hepa-
tocytes, we measured the electrical impedance after infection of
HepG2 cells with B. pseudomallei wild-type as well as the T3SS
(ΔBPSS1539) and T6SS (ΔBPSS1509) mutants at a MOI of ∼400.
Figure 3C illustrates that the electrical impedance of HepG2 cells
after infection with the T6SS mutant ΔBPSS1509 did not differ
signiﬁcantly from the one of uninfected cells whereas infection
with the wild-type strain resulted in a strong loss of electrical
impedance. The decrease of the Normalized Cell Index observed
in HepG2 cells infected with the T3SS mutant ΔBPSS1539 was sig-
niﬁcantly delayed compared to wild-type infected cells. Our data
indicate that B. pseudomallei induces cell damage of HepG2 cells
depending on a functional T3SS and T6SS.

INTERFERON γ INCREASES ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF HepG2 CELLS
AGAINST B. PSEUDOMALLEI
IFNγ is crucial for in vivo resistance against B. pseudomallei (San-
tanirand et al., 1999; Breitbach et al., 2006) and has been shown
to restrict replication of B. pseudomallei in macrophages (Miyagi
et al., 1997; Utaisincharoen et al., 2001). We therefore compared
the intracellular growth of B. pseudomallei between unstimulated
or IFNγ-stimulated (500 ng/ml) HepG2 cells. Although invasion
of B. pseudomallei into HepG2 cells was comparable, already 3 and
6 h after infection intracellular bacterial load was reduced in IFNγ-
activated cells, which was most prominent after 24 h (Figure 4A).
These data indicate that IFNγ is able to increase the antibacterial
capacity of HepG2 cells against intracellular B. pseudomallei in the
early and late phase of infection.

mutant ΔBPSS1509 at MOI of ∼400:1, and cell response was monitored

Burkholderia pseudomallei and hepatocytes

PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES ENHANCE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY
OF IFNγ-ACTIVATED HepG2 CELLS
IFNγ, IL-1β, and TNFα have been detected in livers of BALB/c and
C57BL/6 mice after B. pseudomallei infection (Ulett et al., 2000a,b),
and numerous studies have shown that early cytokine responses
are important for resistance to intracellular pathogens (Ehlers
et al., 1992; Autenrieth et al., 1994; Bohn et al., 1994; Santani-
rand et al., 1999). To examine the impact of these inﬂammatory
cytokines in controlling intracellular B. pseudomallei growth in
hepatocytes, we analyzed the intracellular survival kinetics of B.
pseudomallei in HepG2 cells in the presence of several cytokines.
Therefore, HepG2 cells were stimulated with IFNγ (500 ng/ml),
IL-1β (50–200 U/ml), TNFα (10 ng/ml), or a combination of these
cytokines for 24 h followed by infection with B. pseudomallei. As
shown in Figure 4B, IL-1β or TNFα alone had no or only a mar-
ginal effect on intracellular bacterial replication, whereas the com-
bination of both cytokines caused a small, but signiﬁcant growth
inhibition of B. pseudomallei. In contrast, IFNγ alone reduced bac-
terial multiplication. This inhibitory effect was enhanced, when
IFNγ was combined with either IL-1β or TNFα. The combination
of all three cytokines produced a maintained decrease in intracel-
lular bacterial growth compared to that observed in unstimulated
controls (Figure 4C), suggesting that IFNγ, IL-1β, and TNFα are
essential for the maximal activation of hepatocytes.

INDUCIBLE NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO ELIMINATE
B. PSEUDOMALLEI
Previous studies provided evidence for a crucial role of NO in
growth inhibition of B. pseudomallei in BALB/c macrophages,
whereas NO did not play any role in killing activity of C57BL/6
macrophages (Breitbach et al., 2006, 2011). Thus, we investigated
the role of iNOS-generated NO with respect to intracellular elimi-
nation of B. pseudomallei in HepG2 cells. First, we determined the
amount of NO released from untreated and IFNγ-treated HepG2
cells 24 h after infection with B. pseudomallei. However, we could
neither detect NO in cell culture supernatants nor iNOS protein
expression in lysates of infected HepG2 cells (data not shown).
To assess the contribution of the NO pathway in the antibacte-
rial effect of activated HepG2 cells, we used the iNOS inhibitor
aminoguanidine (2 mM). However, after treatment with the iNOS
inhibitor and infection of resting or IFNγ-stimulated HepG2
cells, we could not observe any signiﬁcant difference in intra-
cellular killing of B. pseudomallei (Figure 5). This suggests that
iNOS-derived NO is not necessary to eliminate B. pseudomallei in
hepatocytes.

NADPH OXIDASE IS NOT INVOLVED IN THE CONTROL OF
B. PSEUDOMALLEI INFECTION
In a recent study we demonstrated that NADPH oxidase-mediated
mechanisms contribute to early resistance in C57BL/6 mice in vivo
and in BMM (Breitbach et al., 2006). Consequently, we investi-
gated the role of NADPH oxidase in the intracellular B. pseudo-
mallei elimination of hepatocytes. For this reason unstimulated
and IFNγ-stimulated HepG2 cells were pretreated with apocynin
(500 μM), a potent and selective inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, fol-
lowed by infection with B. pseudomallei. In spite of a signiﬁcantly
higher invasion of apocynin-inhibited cells (data not shown), our

experiments indicated that bacterial growth of B. pseudomallei
was not impaired by apocynin (Figure 6), suggesting that, in con-
trast to primary murine macrophages, NADPH oxidase does not
contribute to antibacterial activity of human hepatocyte cells.

SCAVENGERS/INHIBITORS OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES DO NOT
INHIBIT THE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY
To further study the involvement of reactive oxygen species as
effector molecules of the antibacterial activity of hepatocytes,
unstimulated, and IFNγ-stimulated HepG2 cells were incubated

oxide dismutase (SOD, 20 U/ml), and/or N -acetyl-cysteine (NAC,
200 μM) prior to infection with B. pseudomallei. Figure 7 shows
that treatment of IFNγ-stimulated HepG2 cells with catalase and
SOD slightly, but not signiﬁcantly reversed the antibacterial activ-
ity. The effect of both antioxidant enzymes added at the same
time was not further enhanced by addition of NAC. However,
treatment of resting HepG2 cells did not increase the number of
CFU recovered, indicating that basal, ROS-mediated antibacter-
ial mechanisms do not exist in hepatocytes. Our results imply that
reactive oxygen species do not play an important role in the control
of B. pseudomallei replication.

DISCUSSION
The liver consists of both hepatocytes and different types of non-
parenchymal cells including endothelial sinusoidal cells, Kupffer
cells, and other immune cells. Although hepatocytes comprise 60%
of cells in the liver and 80% of the hepatic volume (Malarkey et al.,
2005), their role in antimicrobial defense is poorly understood. As
the liver is among the most commonly affected organs in melioi-
dosis, the present study was designed to examine the contribution
of hepatocytes in host defense against B. pseudomallei.

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study showing that B. pseudo-
mallei can infect and replicate within HepG2 cells (Figure 1A).
The intracellular multiplication in hepatocytes is in accordance
with the well-known ability of B. pseudomallei to proliferate inside
several cell types, including phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells
(Jones et al., 1996; Harley et al., 1998; Kespichayawattana et al.,
2000). In addition, our results are consistent with other recently
published data describing that intracellular L. monocytogenes (Gre-
gory and Wing, 1993; Gregory et al., 1993; Wood et al., 1993; Szalay
et al., 1995), S. typhimurium (Lajarin et al., 1996), and Brucella

Burkholderia pseudomallei and hepatocytes

abortus (Delpino et al., 2010) are able to invade and multiply
within primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cells, respectively.

Several in vitro studies have demonstrated that B. pseudoma-
llei T3SS-3 facilitates bacterial invasion of non-phagocytic cells
(Stevens et al., 2003), contributes to escape from endosomes,
intracellular survival, and replication (Stevens et al., 2002), and
is necessary for the induction of caspase-1-dependent cell death
in phagocytic cells (Sun et al., 2005). It has been reported that
BsaU seems to be essential for control of needle length in T3SS-
3 secretion apparatus (Sun and Gan, 2010) and important for
the secretion of the T3SS-3 translocator protein BipD as well as
the effector protein BopE (Hii et al., 2008). We report here that
the intracellular growth of B. pseudomallei in hepatocytes is par-
tially dependent on a functional T3SS, since mutant ΔBPSS1539
(BsaU) exhibited reduced intracellular replication (Figure 1C) as
well as decreased cell damage (Figure 3C) in HepG2 cells. In agree-
ment with our previous study using HeLa cells (Pilatz et al., 2006),
we found here that the transposon mutant of BsaU is unable
to escape from the endocytotic vesicle after invasion, but is still
able to proliferate within the vacuole (Figure 2A). We previously
described that mutant ΔBPSS1509, encoded within the B. pseudo-
mallei T6SS-1 cluster, displays no intracellular growth defect in
J774A.1 macrophages and HeLa cells, but is required for viru-
lence in mice (Pilatz et al., 2006). In contrast, the present study
indicates that mutant ΔBPSS1509 reveals delayed and reduced
induction of actin polymerization (data not shown) as well as
decreased intracellular replication (Figure 1C) and reduced cell
damage (Figure 3C) in hepatocytes compared to the wild-type.
These results are in line with recent reports showing that different
T6SS-1 mutants of B. pseudomallei exhibit reduced intracellu-
lar growth and cytotoxicity in RAW264.7 macrophages (Burtnick
et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2011). Thus, our results suggest that
BPSS1539 encoded by T3SS-3 and BPSS1509 encoded by T6SS-
1 are potential virulence determinants that enable intracellular
growth of B. pseudomallei and induce cell damage in hepatocytes.
However, these factors are unlikely the main players responsible
for intracellular survival in these cells, since HepG2 cells were not
able to eliminate the corresponding mutants.

Hepatocytes have been shown to express a variety of cytokines
(Rowell et al., 1997; Stonans et al., 1999) and to respond to bac-
terial or viral infections with enhanced secretion of inﬂammatory
cytokines and chemokines (Rowell et al., 1997; Santos et al., 2005).
Since it has been shown that numerous cytokines can modu-
late resistance to intracellular bacterial infections, primarily by
stimulating antimicrobial activities (Ehlers et al., 1992; Autenri-
eth et al., 1994; Bohn et al., 1994; Santanirand et al., 1999), we
investigated the impact of cytokine-activated hepatocytes in intra-
cellular B. pseudomallei clearance. IFNγ was previously shown
to be a major factor in primary host defense to B. pseudomallei
(Santanirand et al., 1999; Breitbach et al., 2006). In addition, sev-
eral reports described that both primary murine hepatocytes and
hepatocyte cell lines are efﬁciently activated by IFNγ to kill intra-
cellular L. monocytogenes or S. typhimurium (Gregory and Wing,
1993; Lajarin et al., 1996). This study, demonstrating that IFNγ
is capable to enhance the anti-Burkholderia activity of HepG2
cells (Figure 4A) argues for a potential role of activated hepatoma
cells in host defense against this pathogen. Although IL-1β and

TNFα alone failed to signiﬁcantly activate antibacterial activity
of HepG2 cells, the combination of both cytokines together with
IFNγ caused the most prominent growth inhibition in hepatoma
cells (Figures 4B,C). These results are in line with several reports
indicating that murine hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines stim-
ulated with a combination of IFNγ, TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, or LPS
exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against L. monocyto-
genes (Szalay et al., 1995; Haponsaph and Czuprynski, 1996) and
S. typhimurium (Lajarin et al., 1996, 1999). Therefore, our ﬁnd-
ings suggest that inﬂammatory cytokines, particularly IFNγ, are
important for resistance of hepatocytes against B. pseudomallei.

However, the mechanism responsible for the anti-B. pseudoma-
llei activity of cytokine-activated hepatoma cells remains unclear.
In a previous study we could show that iNOS-generated NO
contributes to resistance in innate susceptible BALB/c mice in
a murine model of melioidosis as demonstrated by enhanced
mortality rates and higher bacterial loads in liver and spleen
of aminoguanidine-treated mice compared to untreated control
mice (Breitbach et al., 2011). Moreover, inhibition of iNOS in
IFNγ-stimulated and B. pseudomallei-infected BALB/c-derived
macrophage cell lines revealed that reactive nitrogen species are
involved in restricting the intracellular growth of B. pseudomallei
(Miyagi et al., 1997; Utaisincharoen et al., 2001, 2003). Our present
data indicate, however, that reactive nitrogen species do not play
any role in controlling B. pseudomallei growth in hepatocytes since
inhibition of NO production by aminoguanidine did not reverse
the antibacterial activity of HepG2 cells (Figure 5). These results
are in good accordance with reports demonstrating that elimina-
tion of L. monocytogenes (Gregory et al., 1993; Szalay et al., 1995;
Haponsaph and Czuprynski, 1996) and S. typhimurium (Lajarin
et al., 1996) from activated hepatocytes is not mediated by nitric
oxide.

Besides the production of NO, the generation of ROS is another
potential mechanism in the control of bacterial pathogens (Inoue
et al., 1995; Vazquez-Torres et al., 2000; Breitbach et al., 2006).
In a previous study we demonstrated that NADPH oxidase is
able to restrict intracellular replication of B. pseudomallei
in
primary murine macrophages (Breitbach et al., 2006). But the
present ﬁndings suggest that neither NADPH oxidase (Figure 6)
nor other ROS-generating enzymes (Figure 7) are involved in
the anti-B. pseudomallei activity of activated hepatoma cells.
In contrast, some reports provided evidence of ROS-dependent
mechanisms in both primary murine hepatocytes and hepato-
cyte cell lines against intracellular L. monocytogenes (Gregory
and Wing, 1993) or S. typhimurium (Lajarin et al., 1996) since
antibacterial activity was inhibited by the presence of scav-
engers or inhibitors of reactive oxygen species. In this context,
Lajarin et al. (1999) indicated that cyclooxygenases (COX) are
a potential source of ROS in S. typhimurium infected murine
hepatocyte cell lines, and thus contribute to antibacterial host
defense. However, several studies revealed that COX are involved
in intracellular replication and survival of different pathogens
(Uchiya and Nikai, 2004; Sadikot et al., 2007; Serezani et al.,
2007).

In summary, the present study describes the in vitro invasion
and intracellular replication of B. pseudomallei in human hepato-
cyte HepG2 cells involving type 3 and type 6 secretion systems.

Burkholderia pseudomallei and hepatocytes

We provide evidence that IFNγ contributes to growth restric-
tion of B. pseudomallei whereas the combination with IL-1β and
TNFα is necessary for the maximal antibacterial activity of hepa-
tocytes. As the IFNγ-mediated effects are independent of NO and
ROS production, we assume that other defense mechanisms are
important to inhibit intracellular multiplication of B. pseudo-
mallei. Thus, further investigations are required to elucidate the

NO- and ROS-independent mechanisms responsible for restrict-
ing intracellular growth of B. pseudomallei in cytokine-activated
hepatocytes.
