It is now well established that Iron (Fe) is a limiting element in many regions of the open
ocean. Our current understanding of the key processes which control iron distribution in the
open ocean have been largely based on thermodynamic measurements performed under
the assumption of equilibrium conditions. Using this equilibrium approach, researchers
have been able to detect and quantify organic complexing ligands in seawater and exam-
ine their role in increasing the overall solubility of iron. Our current knowledge about iron
bioavailability to phytoplankton and bacteria is also based heavily on carefully controlled
laboratory studies where it is assumed the chemical species are in equilibrium in line with
the free ion association model and/or its successor the biotic ligand model. Similarly most
ﬁeld work on iron biogeochemistry generally consists of a single proﬁle which is in essence
a “snap-shot” in time of the system under investigation. However it is well known that the
surface ocean is an extremely dynamic environment and it is unlikely if thermodynamic
equilibrium between all the iron species present is ever truly achieved. In sunlit waters
this is mostly due to the daily passage of the sun across the sky leading to photoredox
processes which alter Fe speciation by cycling between redox states and between inor-
ganic and organic species. Episodic deposition events, dry and wet, are also important
perturbations to iron cycling as they bring in new iron to the system and alter the equilib-
rium between iron species and phases. Here we utilize new ﬁeld data collected in the open
ocean on the complexation kinetics of iron in the surface ocean to identify the important
role of weak iron binding ligands (i.e., those that cannot maintain iron in solution indeﬁnitely
at seawater pH: αFeL < αFe(cid:48)) in allowing transient increases in iron solubility in response to
− source SOTS-1 also indicate the
iron deposition events. Experiments with the thermal O2
short term impact of this species on iron solubility also with relevance to the euphotic
zone. This data highlights the roles of kinetics, redox, and weaker iron binding ligands in
the biogeochemical cycling of iron in the ocean.

INTRODUCTION
That Iron (Fe) is an important limiting nutrient for primary
productivity over large areas of the ocean has been clearly demon-
strated in iron enrichment experiments in the open ocean over
the last 20 years (Martin et al., 1994; Boyd et al., 2000; de Baar
et al., 2005). Since the ﬁrst proposals that linked low productivity
in the open ocean with distance from the coast and iron sources
(Gran, 1931; Harvey, 1937), and since the ﬁrst evidence showing
the link between low iron and slow growth in the open ocean (Mar-
tin and Fitzwater, 1988), studies on the (geo)chemical aspects of
iron biogeochemistry were mainly focused on conditions of ther-
modynamic equilibrium. The thermodynamically favored redox
form of Fe in seawater, Fe(III), is only weakly soluble in seawa-
ter (Millero, 1998). The reduced form, Fe(II), is found in oxic
waters as a transient species, primarily generated by photochemical
processes (Johnson et al., 1994; Croot et al., 2008), and existing at
extremely low concentrations (picomolar or less) because of rapid
oxidation by O2 and H2O2 in warm surface waters. The oxidation
of Fe(II) to the less soluble Fe(III) species, leads to the formation

of colloidal oxyhydroxide (Kuma et al., 1996) species which coag-
ulate and form particulate iron (Johnson et al., 1997). Dissolved
iron (<0.4 µm) has been shown to be strongly organically com-
plexed throughout the water column (Rue and Bruland, 1995;
Boye et al., 2001) and is comprised of colloidal material or truly
soluble (<100 kDa) complexes (Boye et al., 2010). In the absence
of organic ligands iron solubility is extremely low (<80 pM) Fe
(Kuma et al., 1996; Liu and Millero, 2002). Iron solubility however
varies in the ocean with higher concentrations in coastal waters
(Kuma et al., 1998b, 2000; Schlosser and Croot, 2009), than in the
Open Ocean (Kuma et al., 1998a; Nakabayashi et al., 2001).

The main supply routes for iron to the open oceans is via
upwelling or atmospheric dust deposition (Jickells et al., 2005).
Dust deposition is episodic in nature and alters the equilib-
rium between soluble, colloidal, and particulate iron phases. The
daily cycle of the sun also strongly imprints a photo-induced
redox iron cycle in the euphotic zone (Johnson et al., 1994) and
involves transient Fe(II) species existing (Croot et al., 2001, 2008;
Roy et al., 2008) at concentrations far above that predicted by

thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. Indeed it also has been
known for some time that iron uptake by phytoplankton is under
kinetic rather than thermodynamic control (Hudson and Morel,
1990, 1993). Thus information about the kinetics of exchange
between these phases is critically important to our understand-
ing of the biogeochemical cycling of iron in seawater as the system
is normally far from any thermodynamic equilibrium state.

A key controlling factor in the kinetics is the rate of water
exchange (or loss) for the inner coordination sphere of Fe, as this
sets the upper rate at which ligand exchange reactions can occur.
The inorganic speciation of Fe(III) in seawater is dominated by
hydroxide complexes and measurements of the water exchange
(cid:48)
rate under seawater conditions for Fe
(the sum of all the inor-
ganic Fe(III) species) has been measured kex = 8× 106 M
−1
(Hudson et al., 1992). This is consistent with measurements in
simple solutions for the individual iron hydroxy species: Fe(III)
1.6× 102 M
−1 (Grant and
Jordan, 1981), Fe (OH)+
−1 (Schneider, 1988). The rate of water exchange for the
109M
aquo Fe(II), kex ∼ 1× 107 M
−1 (Helm and Merbach, 1999),
is considerably faster than that of Fe(III). Once formed an iron
organic complex may dissociate via either an adjunctive pathway,
involving the direct attack of the incoming species on the initial
complex and the formation of a ternary intermediate species, or a
disjunctive pathway involving complete dissociation of the initial
complex (Hering and Morel, 1990a,b). For a complete description
of the mechanisms involved in the different dissociation pathways

the reader is referred to Morel and Hering (1993). It has been
found for many Fe(III) siderophore complexes that adjunctive
pathways are important with the loss of the iron initiated by the
formation of a ternary complex with another ligand (inorganic or
organic) resulting in either the simple exchange of the iron or a
subsequent reduction to Fe(II) via an external reductant or photo-
chemical process followed by release of the iron from the complex
(Dhungana and Crumbliss, 2005; Mies et al., 2006).

A small number of studies performed over the last 20 years have
indicated that thermodynamically weak iron binding ligands, i.e.,
those that cannot maintain iron in solution indeﬁnitely at seawa-
(cid:48)), may be important as transient species
ter pH (i.e., αFeL < αFe
either as short term soluble species (Gerringa et al., 2007) or
for their involvement in photochemically induced redox cycling
(Kuma et al., 1995). The mesoscale iron enrichment experiments
performed over the last 20 years, for a summary see de Baar et al.
(2005), are now classic examples of the functioning of the iron
biogeochemical cycle to a transient episodic event and how the
system responds. Based on these and other recent ﬁndings we use
Figure 1 to illustrate the key processes and exchange mechanisms
affecting dissolved iron concentrations identiﬁed to date. Figure 1
also highlights the main natural inputs that perturb the system and
prevent it from achieving “geochemical” thermodynamic equilib-
rium. Note that in this context iron in upwelled waters may be
considered closer to equilibrium due to the water mass age and
so is neglected here. In the present work we focus on the kinet-
ics of processes involving weak ligands with regard to important

lar in the here we focus on the role that weak ligands can play
in maintaining soluble iron in the surface ocean over short time
scales through a series of kinetic experiments employing different
analytical approaches (voltammetry and radiotracers). This work
highlights the importance of kinetic processes in the temporal evo-
lution of iron speciation and biogeochemistry in dynamic marine
systems.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
IRON SPECIATION
Competitive ligand exchange-cathodic stripping voltammetry
In the present work we determined conditional stability constants
for natural iron binding ligands using an established cathodic
stripping voltammetry (CSV) technique (Croot and Johans-
son, 2000) utilizing the ligand 2-(2-thiazolylazo)-4-methylphenol
(TAC). A brief description of the procedure for TAC is listed here:
Sub-samples (20 mL) of seawater were pipetted into a series of pre-
cleaned Teﬂon bottles (125 mL) and 100 µL of 1 M EPPS buffer
[N -(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N
-2-propanesulfonic acid; pKa
8.00; SigmaUltra] added. Iron was added to all but two of the bot-
tles, yielding concentrations from 0 to 12 nM. The added Fe was left
to equilibrate with the natural ligands for 1 h at laboratory temper-
ature (21.0± 0.1˚C). At the end of this equilibration period, 20 µL
of 10 mM TAC was added and the sample left to equilibrate for
a further 12 h before analysis by voltammetry (Metrohm VA757).
The samples were then transferred to a Teﬂon cell cup, the sam-
ple deaerated for 4 min with dry nitrogen gas, subsequently the
Fe(TAC)2 complexes in the sample were adsorbed onto a fresh
Hg drop at an applied potential of −0.40 V for 10 min, while the
sample was stirred. At the completion of the adsorption period,
the stirrer was stopped and the potential was scanned using the
fast linear sweep mode from −0.40 to −0.90 V at 10.1 V s
−1 and
the stripping current from the adsorbed Fe(TAC)2 recorded. The
Teﬂon cups were rinsed only with MQ between analyses and the
samples were run in the order of increasing Fe additions. Two +0
samples were run, as a check for possible contamination of the cell.
Each Teﬂon bottle was consistently used for a constant Fe addition.
Full details of the theory behind the CSV approach can be found
in Croot and Johansson (2000). Values for the total iron binding
ligand concentration (LT) and conditional stability constant (Log
k) were determined by non-linear methods (Gerringa et al., 1995).

Kinetic method for Fe speciation (CSV-KIN)
Rate constants for FeL formation (kf), and FeL dissociation (kd),
were determined at seawater pH using the same kinetic approach
as earlier (Wu and Luther, 1995; Witter and Luther, 1998; Wit-
ter et al., 2000) with the exception that the CSV ligand used in
those works, 1-Nitroso-2-Naphthol (1N2N), was replaced by TAC
(Croot and Johansson, 2000). A similar approach using TAC has
been made earlier by Gerringa et al. (2007), as the TAC method
(Croot and Johansson, 2000) is more sensitive and better suited
for Fe determination at seawater pH than 1N2N. As noted by Wit-
(cid:48)
ter and Luther (1998), for consistency we note that Fe
indicates
all inorganic forms of Fe(III), Fe3+
is only the hexaaquo species
[Fe(H2O)6]3+
, and FeL is the ligand complex. Note that in the
(cid:48)
following we also use the commonly used term Fe
L, to represent

(cid:48)
the iron ligand complex formed from Fe
and L however we are
not suggesting the existence of a mixed inorganic and organic lig-
and complex as there is no information currently available for this
with respect to the natural iron binding ligands.

Determination of kf for FeL formation
The formation rate constant, kf, of the Fe3+
-organic ligand com-
plex (represented as FeL) was estimated from the initial rate of
complexation of an aliquot of Fe
added to seawater containing
natural organic ligands at ambient pH.

The rate law for formation of FeL used to calculate the formation
rate constant, kf is shown below:

(cid:48)][L]

(2)

Experimentally this involved the addition of Fe to a seawater sam-
ple and at different time intervals, the competing ligand TAC was
added and the TAC labile iron measured. Mass balance consid-
erations resulted in the calculation of FeL. For the purposes of
(cid:48)
Eq. 2, the initial concentration of Fe
was set to the iron con-
centration added (in this case typically ∼7 nM) and [L] was
estimated from the amount of free ligand present at equilib-
rium (L = LT − FeL) as determined in the Competitive Ligand
Exchange-Cathodic Stripping Voltammetry (CSV-CLE) titration.

Calculation of kd (rate of dissociation for recovery of Fe from FeL)
The dissociation rate constant, kd, for recovery of added Fe from
FeL could be determined after addition of TAC to seawater which
had been pre-equilibrated with an aliquot of 7 nM Fe at ambient
pH. Reaction between TAC and Fe (from FeL) results in electroac-
tive complexes which are detected at the hanging mercury drop
electrode. In the present work we modiﬁed the approach of Witter
and Luther (1998) to determine the dissociation rate of both weak
and strong ligands. Full details can be found in the appendix to
this manuscript.

Measurement of iron solubility kinetics (FESOL-KIN)
The experimental design was principally the same as described
previously for iron solubility experiments (Kuma et al., 1996;
Nakabayashi et al., 2002; Schlosser and Croot, 2009; Schlosser et al.,
2011). An adaptation of these studies was required for the ﬁltration
of the samples, as the 0.02 µm Anotop syringe ﬁlter (Whatman)
previously used (Schlosser and Croot, 2009) were not obtainable
and the alternative ﬁlter material (Millipore MF) was not avail-
able in a syringe ﬁlter. The change in ﬁlter material required a
new ﬁltration system to be constructed. All the equipment used
was constructed from Teﬂon components available commercially
(Savillex). The collection vessel was a 500 mL standard jar with
transfer closure and two tube ports. A 47 mm ﬁlter holder, incor-
porating the 47 mm diameter 0.025 µm ﬁlter (Millipore MF), was
connected in between the ﬁrst of the tube ports and a 200 mL
reservoir tube. The sample solution was poured into the reservoir
tube immediately prior to ﬁltration. To the second tube port of the

jar, vacuum tubing was attached and connected to a trace metal
clean Teﬂon lined vacuum pump (ILMVAC MPR060E) to allow
vacuum ﬁltration of the samples.

In this work we used the radioisotope 55Fe (Perkin Elmer) for all
experiments: speciﬁc activity 1985.42 MBq/mg Fe, concentration
1466.79 MBq/mL. The 55Fe solution was dissolved in 0.1 M HCl
and dilution standards were produced with MQ water and acidi-
ﬁed with Q-HCl to a pH <2. Seawater (200 mL) collected from dif-
ferent depths throughout the water column using trace metal clean
GO-FLO sampling bottles was transferred into Teﬂon FEP bottles
(1 L) and an aliquot of 55Fe was added to the bottles to give an
addition of 21 nM. Sub-samples (20 mL) for ﬁltration were taken
after 3, 6, 24, and 48 h and were ﬁltered through 47 mm 0.025 µm
Millipore MF ﬁlters using the above described Teﬂon ﬁltration unit
(Savillex), the ﬁltrate was collected in a Teﬂon vial. Duplicate sam-
ples of both ﬁltered (0.025 µm) and unﬁltered seawater (400 µL)
were acidiﬁed and transferred into 6 mL vials in which 4.5 mL of
scintillation ﬂuid (Lumagel Plus®) were added. Sample storage,
treatment, and measurement were performed at room tempera-
ture (23˚C) in the isotopic container located on the RV Polarstern.
The activity of the 55Fe solutions were determined by scintilla-
tion counting (Packard, Tri-Carb 2900TR) and then converted to
soluble Fe concentrations, taking into account the activity of the
added isotope solution and the in situ dissolved Fe concentration
of each sample. Quench curves for 55Fe were produced by adding
an identical amount of radiotracer and scintillation ﬂuid to a series
of samples containing a range of seawater additions.

Kinetic analysis of iron solubility
This approach has recently been described (Croot et al., 2011)
however a brief account is given here. Starting from the mass
balance for soluble iron in seawater:

Where [Fe

ciation of Fe(II) is not considered in this case, as due to the long
equilibration times used in these experiments almost all Fe(II)
should have been oxidized. Reactions between one class of the

The approach applied here uses the assumption that the
detected decrease in soluble iron with time is due to the exchange of
Fe between the weak organic ligands and the colloidal phase which
does not pass through the ﬁlter. This assumption is supported by
the ﬁnding that inorganic iron colloids will rapidly form due to
oversaturation in the solution (Nowostawska et al., 2008) and be
considerably larger (Hove et al., 2007, 2008) than the cutoff of the
ﬁlter (Millipore MF 0.025 µm). Earlier work by Okumura con-
ﬁrms that in the absence of a strong chelator over 95% of the Fe is
found in the >0.025 µm fraction (Okumura et al., 2004).

The formation and dissociation of Fe complexes are thus
described by Eqs 4a and 4b from above. We now further assume
that the ligands can be divided into two classes, a strong ligand
(LS) that is practically inert to dissociation and a weaker ligand
(LW) that at equilibrium is not able to keep iron in solution. The
time dependence of the soluble Fe fraction can then be described
by the following equation, assuming that the formation of both
weak and strong complexes is equally fast.

Fesol = FeLs + FeLW

Fesol is the detected soluble iron, FeLS is the concentration of the
strong ligand and FeLW is the concentration of the weaker ligands,
which at thermodynamic equilibrium do not prevent the precip-
itation of iron from solution, and k is the observed dissociation
rate of the weaker iron organic complexes. The measured values of
Fesol are ﬁtted then to Eq. 6 using a non-linear least squares ﬁtting
procedure implemented in Labview™ (National Instruments).

2 on iron solubility kinetics

Examination of the inﬂuence of O−
For a limited number of iron solubility experiments we also exam-
−
ined the inﬂuence of O
2 on the solubility of iron by additions
of SOTS-1 [Di(4-carboxybenzyl)hyponitrite; Molecular weight
−1; Heller and Croot, 2010a] as a thermal source. SOTS-
330.3 gmol
1 is an azo-compound which can be stored stably at −80˚C but at
higher temperatures decomposes thermally to yield either directly
or indirectly electron rich carbon-centered radicals that react with
−
O2 to yield carbocations and O
2 (Ingold et al., 1997). Five hundred
micrograms aliquots of SOTS-1 were used as received (Cayman
Chemicals) and stored at−80˚C until required. Immediately prior
to the start of any experiment the 500 µg SOTS-1 aliquots were
dissolved in DMSO (Fluka, puriss p.a. ≥99.9%) before further
−
dilution in seawater. The ﬁnal concentration calculated for O
2
produced from SOTS-1 in this study was 1.51 µM (500 µg SOTS-
1 in 200 µL DMSO, 40 µL in 200 mL). Experiments in which only
DMSO was added showed no discernable difference when com-
pared to the controls (no DMSO, no SOTS-1). For the experiments
presented in this work, we used paired samples following the same
protocol as for the iron solubility kinetics experiments described
above. After the addition of the radiotracer (see above) to both
samples, SOTS-1 was added immediately to one of the paired
samples (experimental) and the other was left unamended (con-
trol). The iron solubility was assessed at different time points as
described above. In the current work we use the ratio between the

experimental (E) and the control (C), ratio= [Fesol]E/[Fesol]C, to

−
assess the impact of O
2 on iron solubility.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
IRON KINETICS AS DETERMINED BY CSV
Kinetic experiments (Table 1) were performed on samples from
the chlorophyll maximum along a west to east transect in the
Tropical North Atlantic in Oct/Nov 2002 during the Meteor 55
research expedition. Data on the dissolved iron concentrations
found along this transect have been published previously (Croot
et al., 2004). The results of the ﬁve kinetic experiments performed
can be found in Table 1. Figure 2 illustrates the time course in
TAC labile Fe as a function of the reaction time (here denotes
as the TAC exchange time) for two different initial time points;
immediately and 14 h after the addition of Fe to the sample. In
Figure 2 it can be clearly seen that the amount of TAC labile
iron decreases with the time since iron addition and that much
of this iron was recoverable after the addition of TAC. The grad-
ual increase in the TAC labile Fe is interpreted as the exchange
of all the weakly complexed Fe with TAC, though it will ulti-
mately include a contribution from strong iron complexes related
to the thermodynamic equilibrium ﬁnally established between
TAC and the natural ligands. Figure 3 illustrates the decrease in
the labile Fe(TAC) concentration with incubation time resulting
from the increase in FeL as the natural ligands complex the iron
in solution.

Upon addition of TAC the exchange of iron between the nat-
ural ligands and TAC begins. Figure 4 illustrates that this exchange
is effectively come to equilibrium within 6 h and the resulting
Fe(TAC) concentration is identical to that found in the 12 h equi-
libration used in the determination of the thermodynamic data
(Croot and Johansson, 2000). It is clear though from the data in
Figure 4 that equilibration times less than 6 h would be insufﬁ-
cient to reach equilibrium. Data like this for the other ligands used
in the CSV determination of iron organic complexation (Rue and
Bruland, 1995; van den Berg, 2006) is urgently needed to address
this issue as some studies have incorporated equilibration times as
short as 15 min.

Estimates of the formation rate constant for the natural iron
complexes were relatively constant throughout the samples mea-
sured (Table 1) and similar to other open ocean studies (Table 2).
In our study kf values were slightly lower than that found for the
siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFO-B), 2× 106 M
−1 (Hud-
son et al., 1992) but is similar to measurements of other model Fe
ligands (Witter et al., 2000). Dissociation rates found in our work

−1 s

were also similar to other published data from the open ocean
(Tables 1 and 2).

Comparison with the estuarine data of Gerringa et al. (2007)
revealed problems with their model based results, as they indi-
cate that the thermodynamically stronger ligands have both faster
dissociation and formation kinetics than the weak ligands. It is
highly unlikely that the formation rates for the strong ligands are
−1
faster than the water exchange for Fe
(Hudson et al., 1992). While this is mathematically feasible it does
not make chemical sense and indicates that their model was opti-
mizing for the stability constant (K ) of the process and that there
were insufﬁcient constraints on the kinetic rates. This can easily
arise when there are six or more independent variables but only
one or two measured components and no other constraints in
place.

Recently there have been a number of general speciation mod-
els (thermodynamic) that have treated iron complexation in the
ocean as a continuum of ligand binding strengths based on humic
complexation (Hiemstra and van Riemsdijk, 2006; Stockdale et al.,
2011). In these models there is a relationship between the ligand
concentration and the binding strength, with weak ligands present
in high concentrations and only trace amounts of strong ligands.
Criticisms of this approach with regard to iron usually involve
the production of siderophores by organisms as they are speciﬁc
strong binding ligands capable of being produced in high concen-
trations in response to iron limitation (Vraspir and Butler, 2009;
Butler and Theisen, 2010). However in terms of weak ligands this
approach may have some validity but is yet to be applied in a
kinetic approach and may be important for resolving the underly-
ing processes occurring in the colloidal phase with regard to humic
complexation (Batchelli et al., 2010).

IRON SOLUBILITY KINETICS
Experiments on the kinetics of soluble iron formation and
loss were performed at ﬁve stations (Table A1 in Appendix)
along a Atlantic meridional section during Polarstern expedition
ANTXXVI-4 in April/May 2010. In all experiments the concen-
tration of soluble Fe that passed through the Millipore MF ﬁlter
decreased with time. Figure 5 shows the vertical distribution of
soluble Fe over time after iron addition at station 294. Overall
most data ﬁtted the exponential decay model well and suggested
the presence of a weaker Fe binding ligand which was exchanged

solution over short timescales. This ﬁnding is particularly relevant
to the processes occurring during atmospheric deposition (Baker
and Croot, 2010; Duggen et al., 2010) of iron and would help to
solubilize iron at the surface and increase the transport of sol-
uble iron throughout the mixed layer and into pycnocline. The
estimated lifetime for the retention of iron by weak ligands is
from 1 to 2 days, which is signiﬁcantly shorter than the residence
time for dissolved iron in surface waters (weeks to months) of
the same region (Croot et al., 2004). This strongly suggests that
weakly complexed iron plays an important role in the exchange
between soluble and colloidal iron fractions and that colloidal iron
is important over longer time scales for maintaining dissolved iron
levels (Wu et al., 2001; Bergquist and Boyle, 2006; Bergquist et al.,
2007).

Comparison with the CSV data also suggests that TAC can
rapidly remove iron from the weaker complexes as solubility mea-
surements with radiotracers indicate that the concentration of
soluble iron decreases with time to a constant value while Figure 3
illustrates that FeL measured by CSV increases with time to a con-
stant value. Thus it appears that the weak ligands that solubilize
iron also react within the time scale of the CSV measurement
(i.e., minutes) to exchange their iron with TAC suggesting a rapid
adjunctive mechanism accelerated by the presence of 10 µM TAC.
In the case of the natural ligands this process is considerably slower
due to the much lower concentrations of ligands encountered.
The rate of exchange between the natural ligands and TAC is
slightly faster than that observed with 55Fe and suggests a signiﬁ-
cant adjunctive reaction is occurring in the presence of TAC (see
the appendix to this manuscript for details) but it is assumed that
the dissociation kinetics (Tables 1 and 2) for the iron complexes
in the absence of TAC is of a predominantly disjunctive character.
Our modeling approach is similar to that used recently by
Schlosser et al. (2011), with the exception that we focus solely on
the soluble Fe and not Fe adsorbed to the bottle walls or retained as

subsequent time points a subsample was removed,TAC added and the
labile Fe measured by CSV). The corresponding FeL concentration, as
determined by mass balance, is plotted as gray diamonds (dotted line). The
gray triangle represents the [L] determined by the conventional

over the course of the experiment into the colloidal/particulate
phase and with any remaining strong ligand.

The measured dissociation rates for the weak ligands are slightly
slower than the values obtained by CSV (see above and Table 2),
and this may suggest that the dissociation of the weak iron bind-
ing ligands is slightly accelerated in the presence of TAC due to
an adjunctive pathway in addition to the disjunctive pathway seen
in the radiotracer experiments (see also the electronic appendix
to this manuscript). Overall this data indicates the importance
of weak ligands in the soluble size range for maintaining iron in

that initially most of the added Fe is complexed by soluble weak lig-
ands which slowly exchange with colloidal sized ligands (Schlosser

icant sink for added iron in these experiments and is important
to consider in the choice of equipment and experimental design

their pulse radiolysis studies that O

address this issue in the surface ocean. In the single samples from

in the sample which is itself dependent on reactivity with Cu, Fe,

a transient species such as Fe(II) may have been responsible for

this result and required time to accumulate in the initial stages

but decayed away under lower O
−
with O
2 appears to be related to the availability of an accessi-
ble coordination site on the Fe complex, which is also related to
the stability of the complexes (Dhungana and Crumbliss, 2005)
thus the weaker FeEDTA complex is signiﬁcantly more reactive
than the stronger complexes ferrioxamine B and FeDTPA (Fisher
−
et al., 2004). This suggests that O
2 most likely reacts with weakly
bound iron and facilitates its release, while strongly bound iron is
−
inert. Once released the Fe(II) may also react with O
2 leading to a
rapid redox cycle between inorganic Fe(II) and Fe(III) whose turn
−
over rate is related to the O
2 ﬂux. The lag time before achieving
the maximum soluble Fe may then be related to a slow reactivity
(cid:48)
between the weak iron binding ligand relative to Fe
. Further work
is needed however to fully elucidate this mechanism.

For the vertical proﬁle collected at station 279 there was no
statistically signiﬁcant variation (paired t -test) from unity for the
ratio between the soluble iron determined in the SOTS amended
treatment and the control for samples below 100 m. However
in the upper 100 m (Figure 7) there were signiﬁcant differences
observed. Initially all samples in the upper 100 m had ratios lower
than 1 and with time the deeper samples (75 and 100 m) converged
toward a ratio of 1. Interestingly the sample from 25 m continued
to decrease with time to be at 0.46 after 48 h. The sample from
50 m however behaved very differently with the ratio increasing
with time to 1.18 after 48 h. The reasons for these differences may
be related to vertical differences in redox reactions initiated by

2 ﬂuxes from the decay of SOTS-1 in the exper-

(all other experiments) higher than would be found in situ based

after 6–12 h and continued to decrease with time in essence sim-

Oceanic biogeochemical iron cycling kinetics

APPENDIX
METHODS
Kinetic method for Fe speciation
Calculation of kd (rate of dissociation for recovery of Fe from
FeL). Two conditions may result after the recovery period: 100%
recovery of added Fe, or <100% recovery of added Fe (i.e., equi-
librium is established between Fe, natural ligands and TAC). The
solutions described here are adapted from earlier works (Wu
and Luther, 1995; Witter and Luther, 1998). For an alternative
derivation of the rate laws see the later sections of this appendix.

[as Fe(TAC)2] from Fe3+

Weak ligands – all added Fe recovered. The overall reaction for the
recovery of Fe3+
L (which is abbreviated
FeL) is given in A1 as an associative reaction. It was previously
assumed (Wu and Luther, 1995; Witter and Luther, 1998) that this
process can be described by an associative reaction and that Fe3+
(cid:48)
does not accumulate in solution as Fe
FeL + 2 (TAC)

kobs−−→ Fe(TAC)2 + L

(A1)

.

The overall reaction rate is pseudo ﬁrst order in [TAC] due to the
large excess of this ligand and can be expressed as:
− ∂ [FeL]

= ∂ [Fe(TAC)2]

= kobs [FeL] [TAC]

(A2)

∂t

∂t

Integrating gives the following solution:

ln [FeL] = −kobs [TAC] t

(cid:48)

by applying the steady state

(cid:2)Fe

(cid:48)(cid:3) [L] − k2

(cid:2)Fe

(cid:48)(cid:3) [TAC]

(A7)

We can write the rate eq. for Fe
approximation:

(cid:48)(cid:3)

0 ≈ δ(cid:2)Fe
(cid:48)(cid:3) =
(cid:2)Fe

Solving for Fe

Substituting A8 into A9 gives A10:

(cid:48)

(A5):

(A9)

(A10)

In Wu and Luther (1995), two possibilities to simplify A10 were
discussed. First, assuming kf[L] < < k2[TAC] because [TAC]
(1× 10
−δ [Fel]

−5 M) is much larger than [L] then A10 reduces to:

= δ [Fe(TAC)2]

= kd [FeL]

(A11)

(A3)

Integrating A11, and comparing it to A3 gives A12–A13:

(cid:48)

A1 can be broken into two elementary reaction steps; the dissocia-
tion of the natural organic ligand complex to form Fe
(A4), where
Fe
represents the inorganic forms of Fe at ambient pH; and the
reaction of Fe
(cid:48) + L

with TAC (A5):

(A4)

FeL

(cid:48)

(cid:48)

(cid:48) + 2 (TAC) k2−→ Fe(TAC)2

(A5)

The overall reaction A5 is comprised of two sequential steps with
the ﬁrst step (A51) being the rate limiting step:

(A51)

(cid:48) + TAC
Fe (TAC) + TAC

k2−→ Fe (TAC)
k2−→ Fe(TAC)2

(cid:48)

As [TAC] is greatly in excess over [L] ([TAC]= 1× 10

(A52)
−5 M
compared to [L] ∼ 1− 4.0× 10
formed will react
faster with TAC than with [L], and the product Fe(TAC)2 will not
revert to Fe
and TAC during the timescale of the experiment. The
overall reaction rate for A5 will be pseudo ﬁrst order in [TAC] due
(cid:48)
to its large excess. Since TAC forms complexes with Fe
very rapidly
(k2 ∼ 1× 106 M s
−1), there will be no accumulation of Fe
(cid:48)
and/or
(cid:48)
subsequent formation of particulate iron. Therefore, the Fe
con-
centration will always be very small (steady state approximation)
and we can conclude:
δ[Fe
δt

≈ 0

ln [FeL] = −kd t

The dissociation rate constant, kd, can be calculated when 100%
recovery is achieved using A12. A plot of ln[FeL] (M) versus time
−1) allows calculation of kd (M
−1). The conditional stability
(s
constant, K Fe3+L, can then be calculated from A 14 to 15.
KFe(cid:48)L = kf
kd
KFe3+L = αFe(cid:48) × KFe(cid:48)L

(A14)

(A15)

The inorganic side reaction coefﬁcient for Fe used in this work,
(cid:48) = 1010, was determined previously by Hudson et al. (1992).
aFe
The second possible solution (Wu and Luther, 1995) arises from
the observation that the uptake rate of iron by the natural ligands
and TAC are indistinguishable:

kf [L] = k2 [TAC]

then A10 simpliﬁes to:

∂ [Fe(TAC)2]

∂

= kd [FeL]

(A16)

(A17)

Gerringa et al.
(2007) previously estimated the value of
k2 for Fe(TAC)2 formation to vary between 1.14× 107 and

−1 with the highest values found at lower salini-
ties. These values are higher however than the water loss rate of
(cid:48)
Fe
under these conditions (Hudson et al., 1992) and must be
considered an artifact of the modeling scheme they employed.
Our own estimates (unpublished) indicate a value of k2 for
Fe(TAC)2 ∼ 1× 106 M
−1. Using this value in A10, no assump-
tions are necessary in calculating kd. The difference in KFe
L cal-
culated based on A10 with and without assumptions based on
the relative magnitude of kf[L] to k2[TAC] is 100.3, and is not
considered as signiﬁcant.
<100% recovery of added Fe3+
(full equilibrium is established).
If less than 100% recovery of added Fe occurs, the conditional
stability constant for Fe complexation can be determined by con-
sidering that the system has reached equilibrium. In seawater with
natural organic ligands present, Fe3+
shifts from being complexed
by organic ligands as Fe3+
L to Fe(TAC)2 through an associative
(cid:48)
type mechanism so Fe
never forms. A4 can then be expressed in
equilibrium form as:

(cid:48)

(cid:2)Fe3+(TAC)2
(cid:3) [L]
(cid:2)Fe3+L(cid:3) [TAC]2

Krec =

and a stability constant for the reaction can be calculated. Sub-
stituting A19 for Fe3+
L in A18 above and rearrangement to A23
allows calculation of K Fe3+L, since K rec is related to the conditional
stability constant with respect to Fe3+

(K Fe3+L).

The stability constant for K Fe(TAC)2 has been determined exper-
imentally at pH 8.0 to be 1022.4 (Croot and Johansson, 2000).
(cid:48)
Finally a conditional stability constant with respect to Fe
can be
calculated by considering:

KFe(cid:48)L = KFe3+L
αFe(cid:48)

(A21)

(cid:48) at pH 8.0 of 1010 (Hudson et al.,
In this study, we used an αFe
1992). The dissociation rate constant, kd, can then be calculated
from A23 using the values for kf and KFe
L obtained by experiment
(see the methods section in the main text for details).

Alternative derivation of the kinetic method for iron speciation:
The approach used by Luther and colleagues (Wu and Luther,
1995; Witter and Luther, 1998) considers the overall reaction to
be adjunctive (associative) but the rate determining step for the
dissociation of FeL is a purely disjunctive mechanism (A4). The

dependence on the competing ligand arises from inclusion of
a kinetic term incorporating the formation of the electroactive
species in solution. This is therefore in many regards not a strictly
adjunctive mechanism as no ternary intermediate complex (e.g.,
M-L-TAC) is postulated. An alternative derivation of the rate equa-
tions is developed here which considers that a disjunctive (kdis) and
adjunctive (kadj) pathway are occurring simultaneously.

In the present case we assume that there is no reaction between
Fe(TAC)2 and L. The overall reaction is then the same as that
described in A1:
FeL + 2 (TAC)

kobs−−→ Fe(TAC)2 + L

(B6)

The loss rate of FeL can then be described by the following using
the equations described above:

(cid:48)(cid:3) [L] + k−1 [FeL] − k−4 [FeL (TAC)]

In the context of the present work, the terms involving k1
(cid:48)
can be omitted as the concentrations of Fe
, L will always
be small compared to [FeL] and [TAC]. If it is assumed that
[FeL(TAC)](cid:28) [FeL] (see below) then B7 reduces to:
− ∂ [FeL]

= k−1 [FeL] + k4 [FeL] [TAC]

(B8)

∂t

Rearranging leads to:

∂t

(B9)

= (k−1 + k4 [TAC]) [FeL]

− ∂ [FeL]
As above we assume that FeL, Fe(TAC)2 (cid:29) Fe
, FeL(TAC), and
Fe(TAC). A not unreasonable assumption given the stabil-
ity of these complexes under the analytical conditions, then
the following rate law can be postulated from mass balance
considerations:
− ∂ [FeL]

= (k−1 + k4 [TAC]) [FeL]

= ∂ [Fe(TAC)2]

(B10)

(cid:48)

∂t

∂t

Then the loss rate of formation of the natural ligands can thus be
described by the following relationship:

− ∂ [FeL]

∂t

= kobs [FeL]

Where

kobs = kdis + kadj [TAC] = (k−1 + k4 [TAC])
In this formulation kdis = k−1 and kadj = k4.

(B11)

(B12)

Integrating Eq. B11 and applying the appropriate initial and

ﬁnal conditions results in the following relationship:

[FeL]t − [FeL]∞
[FeL]0 − [FeL]∞

= −kobst

(B13)
ln
Where the subscripts 0 and ∞ represent the initial and ﬁnal time
points and the subscript t indicates the time since the experiment
started.

Case I: 100% recovery of FeL
In this case B13 reduces to the following:

ln [FeL]t = −kobst + ln [FeL]0

(B14)

Thus a plot of ln[FeL]t against time has slope kobs. B14 is thus anal-
ogous to A12, though in this case kobs includes both an adjunctive
and disjunctive term.

Case II: <100% recovery of FeL
In this case B13 rearranges to the relationship:

ln ([FeL]t − [FeL]∞) = −kobst + ln ([FeL]0 − [FeL]∞)
Thus a plot of ln([FeL]t − [FeL]∞) against time has slope kobs.
This approach uses kinetic data to determine the value of kobs
from which the values of kdis and kadj can be calculated, and is an
alternative to the thermodynamic approach employed by Luther
and co-workers (see above).

(B15)

Is there a signiﬁcant adjunctive mechanism using TAC?
Unfortunately due to logistical constraints we have no data as yet
with the following; (i) where different concentrations (multiple
detection windows) of TAC have been employed or (ii) simulta-
neous radiotracer and CSV measurements have been performed
on the same water sample. This excludes then a direct assess-
ment of the signiﬁcance of an adjunctive mechanism in Fe(TAC)
formation and this is clearly a goal for future work. However com-
parison of the maximum and minimum rates measured in the
CSV experiments (TAC present) with the radiotracer experiments
−1 and
−1. This suggests then that the adjunctive
mechanism is a signiﬁcant reaction (70–90% of the overall rate)
even at 10 µM TAC.

(TAC absent) gives estimates of kdis = 10
kadj = 5.8 to 17.2 M

Note on Ternary Complex Formation: Central to the deriva-
tion above is the premise that the concentration of [FeL(TAC)]
is always low,
thermodynamically this is likely given that
[TAC](cid:29) [L] but the kinetics of this reaction have yet to be inves-
tigated thoroughly. There is growing evidence for the formation
of such ternary iron complexes, with a recent example being the
investigation of a series of iron-desferrioxamine B – citric acid
complexes (Ito et al., 2011). In the case of TAC, or other ligands
used for CSV, it is not yet known if any of the ternary complexes
formed might also be electroactive.

Special Case I: When reactions B4a and B4b are in pseudo-
equilibrium (steady state approximation) then the following
equilibrium applies:
K4 = k4
k−4

= [FeL (TAC)]
[FeL] [TAC]

(B16)

B7 then reduces to the following:

− ∂ [FeL]

∂t

= k−1 [FeL]

(B17)

In this case the reaction is only disjunctive in character. That is the
adjunctive mechanism, while occurring, is not rate determining.

The values of Ls, Lw, and kd (s−1) were obtained by ﬁtting the raw iron solubility data to Eq. 6 in the main article. Notes: aThe kinetic plots indicated a possible two
step process with an initial rapid iron loss from the soluble phase followed by a slower exchange after 6 h. The data presented is calculated using the single kinetic ﬁt
described in the text.
