cells. Emerging data

During animal development, micro-

tubules (MTs) play a major role in
directing cellular and subcellular pattern-
ing, impacting cell polarization and sub-
cellular organization,
thereby affecting
cell fate determination and tissue archi-
tecture. In particular, when progenitor
cells divide
asymmetrically along an
anterior-posterior or apical-basal axis,
MTs must coordinate the position of
the mitotic spindle with the site of cell
division to ensure normal distribution of
cell fate determinants and equal sequest-
ration of genetic material into the two
daughter
from
diverse model systems have led to the
prevailing view that, during mitotic
spindle positioning, polarity cues at the
cell cortex signal for the recruitment of
NuMA and the minus-end directed MT
motor cytoplasmic dynein.1 The NuMA/
dynein complex is believed to connect,
in turn, to the mitotic spindle via astral
MTs, thus aligning and tethering the
spindle, but how this
connection is
achieved faithfully is unclear. Do astral
MTs need to search for and then capture
cortical NuMA/dynein? How does
dynein capture the astral MTs emanating
from the correct spindle pole? Recently,
using the classical model of asymmetric
cell division—budding yeast S. cerevisiae
—we
successfully demonstrated that
astral MTs assume an active role in
cortical dynein targeting,
in that astral
MTs utilize their distal plus ends to
deliver dynein to the daughter cell cortex,
the site where dynein activity is needed to
perform its spindle alignment function.
This observation introduced the novel
idea that, during mitotic spindle orienta-
tion processes, polarity cues at the cell

receptors

cortex may actually signal to prime the
cortical
for MT-dependent
dynein delivery. This model is consistent
with the observation that dynein/dynac-
tin accumulate prominently at the astral
MT plus ends during metaphase in a
wide range of cultured mammalian cells.

Spindle Positioning
in Budding Yeast

In budding yeast, at least two distinct but
complementary mechanisms dictate the
alignment and positioning of the mitotic
spindle along the cell polarity axis—
termed Kar9 and Dynein pathways. The
Kar9 pathway uses a class-V myosin,
Myo2, which guides the plus ends of
astral MTs along cortical actin cables
toward the apex of the bud cell cortex.2,3
Myo2 binds Kar9, the yeast Adenomatous
Polypopsis Coli (APC) homolog, via its
tail domain. Kar9 in turn binds Bim1, the
yeast EB1 homolog, which interacts with
the plus end of astral MTs. As Myo2
motors along the actin cables (which are
polarized toward the bud tip), it transports
the MT plus end (as cargo) toward the
bud cell tip. There, an attachment-coupled
MT depolymerization event (or capture-
shrinkage) results in the translocation of
the spindle toward the bud cell. These
capture-shrinkage events, which are biased
toward the bud cortex,4 are thought to
be mediated by a MT depolymerase,
the identity of which is still unknown,
although evidence points
to Kip3 (a
kinesin-8)5,6
and/or Kar3 (a kinesin-
14),7-10 both of which exhibit plus end-
specific MT depolymerase activity. The
motor may induce MT depolymerization

with wild-type cells.13,21 A similar pheno-
type was observed when genes encoding
subunits of the dynactin complex were
deleted (discussed below). These data led
to the proposal
that cortical dynein is
delivered (or ‘offloaded’) from the plus
ends of dynamic astral MTs to the cell
cortex (see Fig. 1). The mechanism by
which a minus end-directed motor accu-
mulates at the plus ends of astral MTs
and stays associated with the growing or
shrinking plus end remains a confound-
ing and intriguing mystery. However, the
identities of numerous factors that facil-
itate the targeting and/or the maintenance
of dynein at this site have been revealed,
and to a certain extent their distinct roles
have been characterized.

DHC/Dyn1. As in higher eukaryotes,
the dynein complex in budding yeast
consists of
four different polypeptides,
including the light chain (LC8/Dyn2),
the light-intermediate chain (LIC/Dyn3),
the intermediate chain (IC/Pac11), and
the heavy chain (HC/Dyn1), the latter of
which is solely responsible for the motor
activity of
the complex. Each dynein
complex at the astral MT plus end con-
sists of two subunits of HC/Dyn1, four
of IC/Pac11,
three of LIC/Dyn3, and
likely eight of LC8/Dyn2.22,23 Dyn1
consists of an N-terminal
tail domain,
which is responsible for cortical targeting
in budding yeast (discussed below), and
a C-terminal motor domain (Fig. 2). The
motor domain consists of a MT-binding
domain amidst a concatenated series of six

In contrast, during the Dynein path-
way,4,13 dynein motors attached to the
bud cell cortex cause spindle movements
by walking along astral MTs toward the
spindle pole body (SPB; equivalent
to
centrosome in animal cells). Because the
anchored, dynein’s walking
motor
generates pulling forces at
the cortex.
Also, because the minus end of the astral
MT is stably attached at the SPB, the
astral MT that is being pulled by dynein
slides along the bud cortex, dragging
the spindle into the bud neck, thereby
aligning the spindle along the polarized
cell axis prior to anaphase onset. The
events that conspire to properly position
the spindle are seemingly well coordinated
and tightly regulated since cell division
appears
in a rhythmic and
dependable manner. Our recent data are
beginning to uncover the intricate and
complex series of events that ultimately
result in the targeting of dynein to the cell
cortex in a timely and spatially restricted
manner.

From the Cytoplasm
to the MT Plus End

In a wide variety of cell types, cytoplasmic
dynein is found at the distal tip, or the
plus end, of astral MTs.14-17 Studies from
budding yeast have indicated that
the
targeting of dynein to this site is not
sufficient for Dynein pathway activity in
this organism; rather, the association of
dynein with the cell cortex is required for
dynein function in vivo. Thus, dynein
does not elicit its activity from MT plus
ends. What
the role of plus end-
targeting in dynein function? The first
insight
into this question came from
genetic studies in which the gene coding
for the cortical receptor protein, Num1,18-20
was deleted. In addition to a complete
loss of cortical dynein foci and disrupted
dynein pathway activity,
these mutants
exhibited an enhanced accumulation of

Figure 1. Offloading model for dynein function in budding yeast. Cytoplasmic dynein adopts a
‘masked’ configuration, thus preventing it from being directly recruited from the cytoplasm to
cortical Num1 receptor sites. Dynein associates with Pac1 in the cytoplasm (step 1) forming a
complex that is competent for binding to the astral MT plus end (step 2), which occurs in a Bik1-
dependent manner. Plus end-associated dynein then recruits the dynactin complex (step 3), which
triggers the unmasking event allowing the dynein tail domain to bind to cortically anchored Num1
(step 4; offloading). Cortical dynein-dynactin then binds to astral MTs anchored at the spindle pole
body, and walks toward the minus end, thus pulling the nucleus and associated mitotic spindle into
the neck connecting mother and daughter cells (step 5).

required for the targeting of dynein to

and quantitative fluorescence microscopy
studies have revealed that Pac1 associates
with the dynein complex in a 1:1 ratio in
the cytoplasm prior to its association with
MT plus ends (Fig. 1, steps 1 and 2).22
Interestingly, Pac1 is unable to associate
ends directly, but

dynein for
this activity. Thus, dynein
and Pac1 together comprise a complex
that is competent for plus end-targeting.
A precise mechanistic role for Pac1/
LIS1 in affecting dynein plus end-targeting
remains unknown, but studies in which
dynein motility has been reconstituted in
vitro have revealed possible mechanisms of
action. Recent studies with yeast dynein27
and vertebrate dynein28,29
showed that
both Pac1 and LIS1 reduce the velocity
of dynein motility. One such study using
an optical tweezer found that LIS1 induces
a persistent MT-bound state of dynein

it requires the presence of EB1 for this

Kinesin-7/Kip2. This plus end-directed
kinesin has been shown to transport Bik1
along astral MTs toward the distal tip.36 In
vivo studies37 and in vitro reconstitution
experiments38 demonstrated that the same
phenomenon also occurs with Tea2 and
Tip1, the fission yeast homologs of Kip2
and Bik1, respectively. Since the dynein-
Pac1 complex presumably associates with
Bik1 at astral MT plus ends,
it is not
surprising that dynein has also been obser-
ved to be transported toward the plus end
in a Kip2-dependent manner.26 However,
fluorescence intensity measurements of
Dyn1 in wild-type and kip2Δ mutant cells
indicate
that Kip2-mediated transport
accounts for only ~30% of the dynein-
Pac1 complex at astral MT plus ends.
Direct recruitment
from the cytoplasm
likely accounts for the remaining ~70% of
these proteins at the plus end, although
further studies will be required to test this.
NudEL/Ndl1. Ndl1, a NudE-like pro-
tein, is required for the normal wild-type
frequency of dynein targeting to astral MT

plus ends.39 Genetic and cell biological
analyses showed that Ndl1 may stabilize or
enhance the efficiency of Pac1 binding to
dynein at the plus end, a role consistent
with a subsequent in vitro study in which
the effects of mammalian NudE and LIS1
on dynein motility were determined.28
Intriguingly, a truncated form of yeast
dynein containing only the motor domain
(termed Motor; see Fig. 2) requires Pac1,
but not Ndl1, for astral MT plus end-
targeting,26 suggesting that the dynein tail
domain (termed Tail; see Fig. 2) and Ndl1
are involved in the steps prior to dynein-
Pac1 interaction with the MT plus end.
Both Tail and Ndl1 may cooperate to
promote Pac1 binding to Motor (which
then becomes competent for plus end-
binding via Bik1), as proposed.28 Alterna-
tively, as suggested by our data, Tail might
inhibit Pac1 binding to Motor, and Ndl1,
or other
factors may help relieve this
inhibition.

LIC/Dyn3. Unlike higher eukaryotes
in which multiple isoforms of the dynein
light intermediate chain are found, bud-
ding yeast possesses only a single gene
coding for this accessory chain. Although
the role of Dyn3 in the Dynein pathway
is still unclear, our studies have revealed
that it functions in promoting a proper
and stable conformation of
the dynein
heavy chain. Initial efforts to characterize
Dyn3 led to the proposal
it was
important for the offloading of dynein to
the cell cortex. This was based on the
observation that cortical Dyn1 foci were
absent
lacking Dyn3, whereas
motile cytoplasmic foci of Dyn1, pre-
sumed to be plus end-associated, appeared
to be unaffected.40 However,
two-color
imaging of Dyn1–3GFP and mCherry-
labeled MTs
revealed
that these motile cytoplasmic Dyn1 foci
are not associated with MT plus ends
or any other apparent cellular structure,
suggesting aggregation of Dyn1 in dyn3Δ
cells (Fig. 3A). Immunoblotting of Dyn1
revealed that loss of Dyn3 partially com-
promises Dyn1 protein stability (Fig. 3B).
These data are consistent with findings
in other organisms, in which disruption
of LIC significantly reduced the protein
levels of DHC.41,42 Thus, Dyn3 is required
for the proper targeting of the dynein
complex to astral MT plus ends, possibly

(mCherry-Tub1)

due to the maintenance of a proper Dyn1
conformational state.

As in higher eukaryotes,16,43 the recruit-
ment of dynein to the cell cortex in
budding yeast occurs in a spatially and
temporally restrictive manner. Our studies
in budding yeast have indicated that
dynein must first be targeted to the plus
ends of MTs prior to associating with
cortical Num1 receptor
the
daughter cell cortex (see Fig. 1). What
prevents dynein from being directly
recruited to Num1 in the absence of plus
end-targeting? If dynein has the inherent
ability to bind to cortically anchored
Num1,
inability to bind to
Num1 in the absence of plus end-targeting
intimates the presence of an inhibitory
mechanism. Intriguingly, a truncated form
of yeast dynein containing only the tail
domain is capable of associating with
Num1 receptor sites in the absence of
plus end-targeting. In fact, association of
Tail with the cell cortex is much more
robust than full-length Dyn1. These data
strongly suggest
the dynein tail
domain has an inherent affinity for cortical
Num1 that is independent of MT-bind-
ing.26 Thus, we propose that,
in the
context of the full-length dynein mole-
cule, this activity is negatively regulated
through an intramolecular ‘masking’ of the
tail domain by its motor head.

We recently obtained evidence support-
ing this hypothesis using an engineered
yeast dynein mutant in which a peptide
was inserted into the junction between the
tail and motor domains.27 This mutant
possessed wild-type motor activity but
exhibited targeting characteristic of a con-
stitutively unmasked dynein, which can
also be seen offloading from astral MT
plus ends to the cell cortex. We observed
that the majority of offloading events for
both the mutant as well as wild-type
dynein took place at the daughter cell
cortex. Thus, delivery of dynein to the
place where it is needed appears to be
intrinsic to the offloading mechanism. We
believe that dynein recruitment

Given the localization of dynein to
astral MT plus ends in a wide variety of
cell types, plus end-targeting is likely a
key point of regulation for cortical dynein
activity.
In budding yeast, a regulated
interaction between Dyn1 and Pac1 is
likely an important means by which plus
end-targeting, and thus Dynein pathway
activity,
regulated. Quantitation of
plus end and cortical dynein foci revealed
that dynein targeting is enhanced at both
sites as cells progress from G1 through
mitosis.26 At least two possible scenarios
may account
this enhancement of
dynein-Pac1 targeting to MT plus ends:
(1) upregulation of Pac1 or Dyn1 expres-
sion levels as the cell approaches mitosis;
or, (2) an enhanced affinity of Pac1 for
Dyn1. The first possibility provides a
simple, yet elegant manner
to restrict
dynein activity to the time it is needed
most. However, such a mechanism would
be slow to decrease dynein activity after
the time it is needed, and would be limited
by the half-life of the dynein complex
stability in the cell. Combining such a
mechanism with targeted proteolysis (e.g.,
ubiquitination or sumoylation) may pro-
vide the needed timely removal of dynein
from the astral MT plus ends, and the
concomitant reduction in dynein activity,
however
such a
mechanism would provide the potentially
rapid response time needed for proper
dynein-mediated spindle orientation. An
enhanced interaction between dynein and
Pac1, the second possibility, would result
in an enhanced association of the dynein-
Pac1 complex with astral MT plus ends,
and concomitantly the cell cortex. This

ing to cortical Num1 sites. Our data also
suggested that, after astral MT plus end-
targeting, subsequent association of dynein
with the dynactin complex may mediate
the unmasking event, thus ensuring that
only intact dynein-dynactin complexes are
offloaded to the cortex (see Fig. 1, steps 3
and 4). In support of
this hypothesis,
deletion of genes encoding the various
components of
the dynactin complex
results in a loss of dynein from the cell
cortex without affecting plus end-targeting
of dynein.13 If true, our model proposes
that dynactin would trigger a conforma-
tional change in the dynein heavy chain.
Future structural
studies utilizing such
techniques as super-resolution fluorescence

microscopy or electron microscopy will
shed light on whether dynactin can affect
conformational changes within dynein and
how dynactin controls dynein function at
the astral MT plus ends. Reconstitution of
the offloading phenomenon in vitro will
provide invaluable information pertaining
to the role of each of the dynein pathway
components in offloading, and will shed
light on the mechanism by which it occurs.

the dynein:dynactin ratio is reduced to
from 2:1 to 1:1. Accordingly, she1Δ cells
exhibit
augmentation of
Dynein pathway activity. While She1
may affect other aspects of Dynein path-
way activity, these data suggest that She1
has a role in regulating the interaction
between cortically-anchored dynein with
dynactin, and that this interaction poses
yet
another means by which dynein
pathway activity may be regulated in
the cell.
