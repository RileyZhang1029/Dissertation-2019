Wildlife is normally not exposed to clinically used antimicrobial agents but can acquire
antimicrobial resistant bacteria through contact with humans, domesticated animals and
the environment, where water polluted with feces seems to be the most important vector.
Escherichia coli, an ubiquitous commensal bacterial species colonizing the intestinal tract of
mammals and birds, is also found in the environment. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases
producing E. coli (ESBL-E. coli) represent a major problem in human and veterinary med-
icine, particular in nosocomial
infections. Additionally an onset of community-acquired
ESBL-E. coli infections and an emergence in livestock farming has been observed in recent
years, suggesting a successful transmission as well as persistence of ESBL-E. coli strains
outside clinical settings. Another parallel worldwide phenomenon is the spread of ESBL-
E. coli
into the environment beyond human and domesticated animal populations, and
this seems to be directly inﬂuenced by antibiotic practice. This might be a collateral conse-
quence of the community-onset of ESBL-E. coli infections but can result (a) in a subsequent
colonization of wild animal populations which can turn into an infectious source or even a
reservoir of ESBL-E. coli, (b) in a contribution of wildlife to the spread and transmission of
ESBL-E. coli into fragile environmental niches, (c) in new putative infection cycles between
wildlife, domesticated animals and humans, and (d) in problems in the medical treatment of
wildlife.This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on ESBL-E. coli in wildlife, in
turn underlining the need for more large scale investigations, in particular sentinel studies
to monitor the impact of multiresistant bacteria on wildlife.

INTRODUCTION
The mere occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and correspond-
ing resistance genes in the environment is an ancient phenomenon
which results from the simple fact that most of the antimicrobial
substances currently in use are based on natural precessors pro-
duced by soil bacteria likeStreptomycetes (D’Costa et al., 2011).
The function of these precessors of modern day antibiotics was
presumably more related to microbial competition for an ecolog-
ical niche, and thus is very distinct from the “weapon-shield” role
they play in clinical settings today (Martinez, 2009a,b; Allen et al.,
2010). Nevertheless the increase in non-intrinsic antimicrobial
resistance in pathogenic bacteria started after the introduction of
antibiotics in medicine some 60 years ago suggesting a correlation
between antimicrobial pressure and the emergence of resistance
in pathogens (Allen et al., 2010; Bonnedahl, 2011). Although
we consider the detection of multidrug resistant pathogens like
Extended-spectrum beta-Lactamases producing Gram-negatives
in wildlife as a new phenomenon, it could have been anticipated,
as antimicrobial resistant bacteria other than intrinsically resis-
tant soil organisms were already found in environmental samples
apparently free from any antimicrobial pressure decades ago (Sato
et al., 1978; Kanai et al., 1981; Hughes and Datta, 1983; Tsubokura
et al., 1995).

While various bacterial species are important in terms of mul-
tiresistance and nosocomial infections in human and veterinary

medicine, we consider the Gram-positive Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Extended-spectrum beta-
lactamases producing Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli
(ESBL-E. coli) as being key indicator pathogens to trace the evo-
lution of multiresistant bacteria in the environment and wildlife.
Both multiresistant organisms also made their way into livestock
farming and companion animals (Smet et al., 2010b; Ewers et al.,
2011; Wieler et al., 2011). Recent surveillance data on antimicrobial
resistance among these organisms in human clinical settings dis-
play two major trends. According to the EARS-NET database1 the
prevalence of MRSA has remained on a high but stable level over
the last years, whereas that of ESBL-E. coli has been on a contin-
uous rise during the last decade. Although the majority of ESBLs
are still reported from human clinical isolates (Bradford, 2001;
Bonnet, 2004; Pitout, 2010), they are also increasingly recorded
in community-acquired bacterial infections. This indicates that
ESBL-E. coli have made their way out of the clinics, have been suc-
cessfully transmitted and now persist in the community (Arpin
et al., 2005; Pitout et al., 2005; Wieler et al., 2011).

population, it is important to keep in mind the general E. coli
population as well. E. coli is ubiquitous, and asymptomatically
colonizes the gut of birds and mammals. Therefore, E. coli are
found globally, not only in the gut but also in the environment
(Wirth et al., 2006; Goldberg et al., 2008; Rwego et al., 2008). The
intestinal population of E. coli in mammals and birds varies enor-
mously between individuals even of the same species. This is why
knowledge on the E. coli population of a single species is actually
scarce and limited to single studies only, which do not represent
the species as a whole (Schierack et al., 2008a,b; Leser and Molbak,
2009) It is however clear, that the use of antimicrobial compounds
selects for resistant clones, with one mechanism being horizontal
gene transfer between strains (LeClerc et al., 1996).

Although so far it is not clear how ESBL-E. coli make their
way into the natural environment, they were seen to occur in the
environment two decades after the ﬁrst ESBL-E. coli outbreaks
in human clinical settings (Kitzis et al., 1988; Bauernfeind et al.,
1989; Costa et al., 2006). Simultaneously a community-onset of
ESBL-E. coli has taken place and one might speculate whether
environmental ESBL-E. coli are a spill-over form of environmen-
tal pollution from highly human inﬂuenced settings (Arpin et al.,
2005; Pitout et al., 2005; Martinez, 2009a). Interestingly the ﬁrst
reports on ESBL-E. coli in wildlife date back shortly after their
appearance in livestock farming which could also hint toward
a manure driven spread of ESBL-E. coli into the environment
(Kummerer, 2009). It seems unlikely that pathogens isolated from
wildlife have acquired resistance through new parallel mutations in
the respective genes. Horizontal transfer of resistance genes from
clinical isolates or the intake of already resistant bacteria from
human waste, sewage, and domesticated animal manure might be
more probable (Kummerer, 2009; Martinez, 2009b).

Escherichia coli from wildlife may thus express a multiresis-
tant phenotype, not due to the nearby use of antimicrobials or
antimicrobials in subtherapeutic concentrations in natural envi-
ronments, but because distant use had caused a multiresistant
organism to evolve in the ﬁrst place which subsequently spread
to different ecological niches (O’Brien, 2002). The presence of
commensal and pathogenic bacteria in fecal contaminations can
be assumed to be a link between settings with regular or even
constant antimicrobial pressure (livestock farming, aquaculture,
human, and veterinary clinical settings) and the environment,
resulting in a constant release of antibiotic-resistant human and
animal bacteria into the environment through wastewater or
manure (Martinez, 2009b). The detection of antimicrobial resis-
tant bacteria in aquatic environments affected by human and
animal wastewater and soil provides evidence for this hypothesis
(Kummerer and Henninger, 2003). In this context the common
use of antibiotics in aquaculture of ﬁsh is also of utmost impor-
tance due to possible direct inﬂuences on waterbirds (Baquero
et al., 2008; Smith, 2008). As intestinal bacteria like E. coli can
be easily disseminated in different ecosystems through water they
are intensively used as indicator species for fecal pollution, but
S. aureus is also regularly isolated from fecal samples. Therefore
they could also be used to track the evolution of antimicro-
bial resistance into different ecosystems (Van Den Bogaard et al.,
2000). Furthermore E. coli despite its commensal character is fre-
quently implicated in animal and human infections that require
the use of antibiotics which adds public health concerns to the

list of implications that arise from the spread of ESBL-E. coli into
wildlife.

In contrast to studies on the appearance of ESBL-E. coli in
humans and domesticated animals, their presence in wildlife has
been addressed rarely. This review therefore summarizes currently
available data on the presence of ESBL-E. coli in wildlife, con-
centrating on birds and rodents. It aims to bring about awareness
about the urgent need to gather knowledge on the impact of ESBL-
E. coli to the microbiota of wild animals and the consequences
arising thereof for the environment and public health, acknowl-
edging the zoonotic potential of E. coli and its abundance in nature
(Allen et al., 2010; Bonnedahl, 2011).

BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS
The class of beta-lactam antibiotics is among the most important
groups of antimicrobial agents in human and veterinary medicine.
The chemical substances are in principal identical in both ﬁelds of
clinical use. Besides the ﬁrst widely used antimicrobial substance
penicillin, other members of this family have gained a similar
importance over the last decades, namely the ﬁrst- to fourth-
generation cephalosporins and the beta-lactamase-inhibitors. In
the veterinary context the few studies that exist conﬁrm that beta-
lactam antimicrobials are the most commonly prescribed antimi-
crobials in small animals (DANMAP, 2007; SVARM, 2008). In
livestock, a decrease in the use of beta-lactam antimicrobials could
be observed over the last years (NORM/NORM-VET, 2010), basi-
cally due to restrictions in prescription. All beta-lactams interfere
with the ﬁnal stage of peptidoglycan synthesis through acting on
penicillin-binding proteins, thereby preventing the bacterial cell
wall from forming. The peptidoglycan constitutes a layer between
the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane which main-
tains the cell shape and protects the bacterium against osmotic
forces. The most common resistance mechanism of Enterobacte-
riaceae spp. against beta-lactams is the inactivation of the drug by
hydrolytic cleavage of the beta-lactam ring system (Greenwood,
2000).

BETA-LACTAMASES
More than 400 different beta-lactamase enzymes are currently
known, sharing the same resistance mechanism but differing in
their range of substrates and susceptibility against inhibitory sub-
stances2. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases display an extended
substrate spectrum, and this has directly inﬂuenced a global
change in the epidemiology of beta-lactamases since the early
1990s in human medicine and since 2000 in veterinary medicine
(Kong et al., 2010; Pitout, 2010; Smet et al., 2010b). The term
extended-spectrum determines the ability of ESBLs to hydrolyze
a broader spectrum of beta-lactam antimicrobials than the par-
ent beta-lactamases they were originally derived from. While they
are capable of inactivating beta-lactam antimicrobials contain-
ing an oxyimino-group such as oxyimino-cephalosporins (e.g.,
ceftazidime, cefotaxime) as well as oxyimino-monobactam (aztre-
onam), ESBLs are not active against cephamycins and carbapen-
ems. They are usually inhibited by beta-lactamase-inhibitors like
clavulanic acid and tazobactam, which marks a difference between

ESBL-E. coli in wildlife

ESBL- and AmpC–beta-lactamases producing bacteria (Bradford,
2001). Several different classiﬁcation schemes for bacterial beta-
lactamases have been described, including the system devised by
Bush et al. (1995) which is based on the activity of the beta-
lactamases against different beta-lactam antimicrobials, and the
currently most widely used Ambler system, which divides beta-
lactamases into four classes (A, B, C, and D), based on their amino
acid sequences (Ambler, 1980). The majority of ESBLs belong
to Ambler class A and to the Bush group 2be. ESBLs have been
found in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria, but the vast
majority of bacterial hosts belong to the family of Enterobac-
teriaceae, including Klebsiella spp., E. coli, Salmonella enterica,
Citrobacter spp., and Enterobacter spp. (Bradford, 2001). Four
enzyme families, namely TEM (Temoneira) -type beta-lactamases,
SHV (Sulfhydryl variable) -type beta-lactamases, CTX (cefotax-
imase) -M-type beta-lactamases, and OXA (oxacillinase) -type
beta-lactamases are currently regarded the most common ESBLs
among Enterobacteriaceae spp. TEM-type beta-lactamases are
derivatives of TEM-1, which was ﬁrst demonstrated in 1965 in an
E. coli isolate from a patient in Athens, Greece, named Temoneira,
and of TEM-2 and consist of more than 150 different enzymes.
While the majority of TEM beta-lactamases are ESBLs, TEM-1,
TEM-2, and TEM-13 are only able to hydrolyse penicillin derivates
and thus are not regarded as ESBLs (Livermore, 1995).

Similar to TEM-type enzymes the majority of SHV enzymes
are ESBLs. All currently recognized SHV enzymes are derivatives
of SHV-1 and SHV-2. Whereas SHV-1 merely confers resistance
to broad-spectrum penicillins, SHV-2, which was ﬁrst described
in 1983 in a Klebsiella ozaenae strain isolated in Germany, is able
to hydrolyse cefotaxime (Gupta, 2007). In contrast to TEM- and
SHV-type beta-lactamases, most of the members of the OXA-
type beta-lactamase family are not regarded as ESBLs because
they do not hydrolyze third generation cephalosporins with the
exception of OXA-10, OXA-2, and their derivatives3. However, dis-
tinct OXA-types (OXA-carbapenemases) play an important role in
antimicrobial resistance, e.g., of Acinetobacter baumannii (Pfeifer
et al., 2010).

Currently regarded as the most important ESBL enzyme family
are the CTX-M-type beta-lactamases, named after their ability
to hydrolyze cefotaxime. They are supposed to originate from
beta-lactamases from Kluyvera spp. and currently comprise of
more than 70 different CTX-M enzymes divided into ﬁve groups
depending on their amino acid sequence (CTX-M-1, CTX-M-
2, CTX-M-8, CTX-M-9, and CTX-M-25; Hawkey and Jones,
2009; Pitout, 2010; Naseer and Sundsfjord, 2011). AmpC–beta-
lactamases confer resistance to most of the beta-lactam antimi-
crobials with the exception of methoxy-imino-cephalosporins
(cefepime) and carbapenems, while they are not inactivated by
beta-lactamase-inhibitors like clavulanic acid.

Within the last years the emergence of carbapenem-hydrolyzing
beta-lactamases like NDM-1, KPC, and OXA has threatened
the clinical utility of
(Pfeifer et al.,
2010, 2011; Poirel et al., 2010; Walsh, 2010). Carbapene-
mases are beta-lactamases that are active not only against the

this antibiotic class

3http://www.lahey.org/studies/

oxyimino-cephalosporins and cephamycins but also capable of
hydrolyzing carbapenems like imipenem or meropenem. These
substances often display the “last line of defense” in the treatment
of infections with multiresistant Gram-negative pathogens. This
group of beta-lactamases is very diverse and can be found in three
different β-lactamase classes (class A, B, and D). Detailed informa-
tion on these enzymes is given in some excellent reviews (Walsh,
2010; Patel and Bonomo, 2011).

ESBLs IN HUMAN AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS
The ﬁrst nosocomial outbreak of CTX-M-1 type ESBLs was
recorded in an intensive care unit in a hospital in Paris, France
(Kitzis et al., 1988). Shortly after that, Bauernfeind et al. (1989)
reported on a clinical cefotaxime-resistant E. coli strain in Ger-
many which produced a CTX-M-1 type beta-lactamase. In the
following 10 years several studies reported about an explosive
dissemination of ESBLs in human clinical settings worldwide
(Bernard et al., 1992; Gniadkowski et al., 1998; Radice et al., 2002;
Canton and Coque, 2006). Several review articles provide detailed
insight into the occurrence and molecular epidemiology of ESBL
producing Enterobacteriaceae in humans and animals (Bradford,
2001; Bonnet, 2004; Canton and Coque, 2006; Livermore et al.,
2007; Cantón et al., 2008; Oteo et al., 2010; Pfeifer et al., 2010;
Pitout, 2010; Wieler et al., 2011).

Since about 2000, the CTX-M enzymes have formed a rapidly
growing family of ESBLs in human clinical and community set-
tings (Bonnet, 2004; Pitout and Laupland, 2008; Mshana et al.,
2009), whereas the prevalence of classical ESBL enzymes like TEM
or SHV is decreasing (Livermore et al., 2007). With the begin-
ning of the twenty-ﬁrst century E. coli producing CTX-M-15 have
emerged and disseminated worldwide as an important cause of
both nosocomial and community-onset urinary tract and blood-
stream infections in humans (Coque et al., 2008; Hunter et al.,
2010; Oteo et al., 2010; Pitout, 2010). A number of molecular epi-
demiological studies revealed that the sudden worldwide increase
of CTX-M-15-producing E. coli has been largely inﬂuenced by the
spread of one single clonal group of strains, namely B2:O25b:H4-
ST131-CTX-M-15, across different continents (Nicolas-Chanoine
et al., 2008; Rogers et al., 2011). The recent emergence of yet
another clonal group, ABD-O1:H6-ST648-CTX-M-15, envisions
the potential of just a limited number of clones to spread glob-
ally (Doi et al., 2010; Zong and Yu, 2010; Van Der Bij et al., 2011;
Wieler et al., 2011). Unraveling the microevolution of strains of
these clones in habitats and ecological niches others than human
and veterinary clinics offers the chance to understand what leads
to persistence of ESBL-E. coli in surroundings lacking selective
antibiotic pressure.

In the ﬁeld of veterinary medicine an SHV-12-type beta-
lactamase producing E. coli was the ﬁrst clinical ESBL producing
bacteria isolated from a dog with recurrent urinary tract infection
in Spain in 1998 (Teshager et al., 2000). This was followed by the
detection of ESBL producing E. coli (mostly TEM and SHV) in
dogs from Italy, and Portugal (Feria et al., 2002; Carattoli et al.,
2005).Very recently several studies also reported companion ani-
mals as hosts for ESBL-E. coli harboring CTX-M enzymes, leading
to the assumption that CTX-M-type enzymes will dominate the
situation in veterinary medicine in the future as well (Vo et al.,

ESBL-E. coli in wildlife

2007; Carattoli, 2008; O’Keefe et al., 2010; Smet et al., 2010b).
This is exempliﬁed by the emergence of the clonally related group
of E. coli B2-O25b:H4-ST131-CTX-M-15 in the ﬁeld of compan-
ion animals, as well (Pomba et al., 2009; Ewers et al., 2010, 2011;
Biohaz, 2011; Wieler et al., 2011).

Extended-Spectrum beta-lactamases mostly of the TEM, CTX-
M, and SHV-type have been frequently demonstrated in the micro-
biota of food-producing animals which has nicely been reviewed
by Smet et al. (2010b). Within the last decade, the number of
publications reporting ESBL-E. coli isolated from food-producing
animals has increased drastically. Noticeably, most ESBL enzymes
identiﬁed in E. coli from livestock are likewise present in bacteria
from humans (Smet et al., 2010b).

ESBLs IN WILDLIFE
A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
The ﬁrst reports on the presence of resistance determinants in E.
coli from human and animal populations lacking selective antimi-
crobial pressure date back to the 1960s (Mare, 1968). Antimicrobial
resistant E. coli isolates originating from wildlife species were
reported for the ﬁrst time at the beginning of the 1980s from
Japanese wild birds (Sato et al., 1978; Kanai et al., 1981; Tsubokura
et al., 1995) and 5 years later in South African baboons feeding on
human refuse (Rolland et al., 1985; Routman et al., 1985). With the
new millenium the number of studies describing the occurrence
of antimicrobial resistant E. coli in wildlife increased signiﬁcantly
(Gilliver et al., 1999; Souza et al., 1999; Sherley et al., 2000; Fallacara
et al., 2001; Livermore et al., 2001; Osterblad et al., 2001; Swiecicka
et al., 2003; Cole et al., 2005; Lillehaug et al., 2005; Middleton and
Ambrose, 2005; Sayah et al., 2005; Skurnik et al., 2006; Dolejska
et al., 2007; Literak et al., 2007; Carattoli, 2008; Gionechetti et al.,
2008; Ewers et al., 2009; Guenther et al., 2010c).

However, the detection of ESBL-E. coli of wildlife origin dates
back to 2006 only (Costa et al., 2006). Since then several reports
followed (Costa et al., 2008; Poeta et al., 2008, 2009; Bonnedahl
et al., 2009, 2010; Dolejska et al., 2009; Literak et al., 2009a,b, 2010;
Guenther et al., 2010a,b; Hernandez et al., 2010; Pinto et al., 2010;
Radhouani et al., 2010; Simoes et al., 2010; Smet et al., 2010b;
Garmyn et al., 2011; Ho et al., 2011; Silva et al., 2011; Sousa et al.,
2011; Wallensten et al., 2011).

A GEOGRAPHICAL PERSPECTIVE
Although ESBL-E. coli isolates of wildlife origin have only been
reported from Europe (Costa et al., 2008; Poeta et al., 2008, 2009;
Bonnedahl et al., 2009, 2010; Dolejska et al., 2009; Literak et al.,
2009b, 2010; Guenther et al., 2010a,b; Pinto et al., 2010; Radhouani
et al., 2010; Simoes et al., 2010; Garmyn et al., 2011; Silva et al.,
2011; Sousa et al., 2011; Wallensten et al., 2011), Africa (Literak
et al., 2009a), and Asia (Hernandez et al., 2010; Ho et al., 2011) so
far, their absence in the Americas, Antarctica, and Australia might
simply reﬂect the different number of studies performed in these
continents. As multiresistant E. coli have already been reported
from the latter continents (Souza et al., 1999; Sherley et al., 2000;
Fallacara et al., 2001; Cole et al., 2005; Middleton and Ambrose,
2005; Sayah et al., 2005; Kozak et al., 2009; Silva et al., 2009) one
could anticipate ESBL-E. coli of wildlife origin to be present as well.
Nevertheless data from one continent or region may not act as a

suitable baseline for another, and may not correlate with the level
of antibiotic use in the regions involved. Besides simple geograph-
ical effects like the continent of origin it seems more appropriate
to reconsider the type of region where the isolates originate from.
Parameters which have been assumed as important criteria include
the natural preservation state, livestock, and human density or the
remoteness of an area (Allen et al., 2010). The level of resistant
bacteria observed in wild animals seems to correlate well with the
degree of association with human activity (Skurnik et al., 2006;
Allen et al., 2010). Nevertheless, several studies report the occur-
rence of ESBL-E. coli in remote places or preservation areas as well
(Hernandez et al., 2010; Pinto et al., 2010) underlining the com-
plexity of the spread of antimicrobial resistance in wild animals.
These ﬁndings suggest on the one hand an inﬂuence of migra-
tory behavior of wild birds for instance into remote areas or on
the other hand the omnipresence of human inﬂuence in various
ecological niches of the planet basically via human feces. Most
studies on ESBL-E. coli in wildlife originate from Central Europe,
an area with high livestock and human density and an assumable
frequent interaction of wildlife with human inﬂuenced habitats of
any kind like livestock farms, landﬁlls, sewage systems, or waste-
water treatment facilities, resulting in a higher risk for wildlife
acquiring antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Allen et al., 2010). It has
previously been shown that gulls shared strains of E. coli with
isolates cultured from landﬁlls and wastewater treatment plants
(Nelson et al., 2008). This underlines the possibility of bacterial
exchange between human sewage and birds.

As summarized in Table 1 the detection rates of ESBL-E. coli
in different geographical areas ranged from 0.5% in birds of the
remote Azores islands in the Atlantic Ocean (Silva et al., 2011) to
32% for birds of the Iberean peninsula (Simoes et al., 2010). How-
ever, one should certainly keep in mind differences with regards
to host species, sampling schemes, and geographic regions and the
limitations that arise from this when interpreting these data. Nev-
ertheless, for Central Europe the number of studies performed
is relatively high, and there does not seem to be a difference in
the detection rates between agriculturally used lands or urban
environments compared to natural preserve areas, since in both
types of areas detection rates higher than 20% have been observed
(Table 1). Only in remote areas like the Azores or the Kamchatka
peninsula the rates seem to be lower with approximately 1% ESBL-
E. coli (Hernandez et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2011), suggesting a
possible dilution effect of the pollution of wild animals with ESBL-
E. coli. Nevertheless our own data from birds of prey from the
Mongolian Gobi-Desert, an area among the ones with the lowest
human density, revealed ESBL rates which were comparable with
the situation in Central Europe (Guenther et al., 2010c).

A HOST SPECIES PERSPECTIVE
General information about the microbiota of wild living birds and
rodents is scarce and restricted to single species as hosts of certain
pathogens. E. coli is a common gastrointestinal but very versatile
bacterium, and can be grouped into non-pathogenic (commensal)
and pathogenic strains; the latter cause intestinal or extraintestinal
diseases in humans and animals (Johnson and Russo, 2002; Wirth
et al., 2006). The ubiquitous occurrence of E. coli is based on its
asymptomatical colonization of the gut of birds and mammals

and in turn the resulting spread into the environment (Rwego
et al., 2008; Schierack et al., 2008a). The degree of colonization
varies a lot between different bird species (Gordon and Cowling,
2003) and the same has been shown for rodents and small mam-
mals (Swiecicka et al., 2003; Guenther et al., 2010c). E. coli is most
likely to be isolated from omnivore birds and mammals (Gor-
don and Cowling, 2003). More than 30 wild animal species have
been found shedding ESBL-E. coli and most of them were birds
or rodents (Table 1). The occurrence of ESBL-E. coli is therefore
clearly inﬂuenced by the host spectrum of E. coli and furthermore
by the degree of synanthropic behavior shown by the host animal
species. In other words, animals living in urbanized areas are more
likely to carry E. coli than animals living in remote areas (Allen
et al., 2010; Bonnedahl, 2011).

Other basic questions concerning the occurrence of ESBL-
E. coli in fecal samples are still unsolved. Future studies should
therefore address the nature of the abundance of these mul-
tiresistant strains in feces to clarify if they are just shedded in
short terms, present transient, or long term colonizations of

the gut of the animals asymptomatically or even are persistent
infections.

When reviewing the current literature it appears that wild birds
could be the main wildlife hosts for ESBL-E. coli. This impression
is created because most of the studies were carried out on wild
birds; however, taking into account studies involving other wildlife
animals such as deer, small ruminants, small and large predators,
lagomorphs, reptiles, and amphibians (Costa et al., 2006; Literak
et al., 2009b) an insigniﬁcant number of ESBL-E. coli was observed.
Due to their diversity in ecological niches, and their ease in
picking up human and environmental bacteria, wild birds might
act as mirrors of human activities. Within the heterogeneous class
of birds two groups seem to be in the focus of ESBL carriage
in wildlife: waterfowl/water related species (Poeta et al., 2008;
Bonnedahl et al., 2009, 2010; Dolejska et al., 2009; Guenther et al.,
2010b; Hernandez et al., 2010; Literak et al., 2010; Simoes et al.,
2010; Garmyn et al., 2011; Wallensten et al., 2011) and birds of
prey (Costa et al., 2006; Pinto et al., 2010; Radhouani et al., 2010;
detailed species information is given in Table 1). Other groups

of birds like passerines (Guenther et al., 2010a; Silva et al., 2011)
seem to carry ESBL-E. coli less often or sometimes not at all (Silva
et al., 2010). This ﬁnding might be inﬂuenced by differences in the
composition of the microbiota and the harboring of E. coli within
these diverse avian species. In a recent study we were able to show
that if E. coli could be isolated from different bird species, mul-
tiresistant E. coli clones originated from birds of prey or waterfowl
(Guenther et al., 2010d). Other avian hosts reported were Owls
(Costa et al., 2006; Pinto et al., 2010) and Ravens (Pinto et al.,
2010), birds which display a feeding behavior comparable to birds
of prey.

While the dominance of waterfowl within the avian host spec-
trum of ESBL-E. coli can be explained by fecal pollution of water
by human or livestock sources, the transmission scenarios for the
other main group – birds of prey – seem to be more complex. As
birds of prey are on top of the food chain they could accumulate
ESBL-E. coli from their typical prey, like mice and shrews. Due to
their synantropic behavior, they are presumably more often in con-
tact with humans or livestock. Indeed for mice it has been shown
that proximity to livestock farming increases the carriage rates of
multiresistant E. coli (Kozak et al., 2009). Although rodents have
earlier been in the focus of research on ESBL in wildlife (Gilliver
et al., 1999; Kozak et al., 2009; Literak et al., 2009b; Guenther et al.,
2010c), to the best of our knowledge ESBL-E. coli have not yet been
detected in rodents with the exception of urban rats (Guenther
et al., 2010b; Ho et al., 2011).

Our own data from Germany revealed a very low abundance for
multiresistant E. coli in rodent and shrews, indicating that other
groups of prey and transmission routes between the human inﬂu-
enced ecosphere and birds of prey might be possible (Guenther
et al., 2010c). Furthermore, many of the bird species which have
been tested positive for ESBL-E. coli carriage display migration
behavior which provides a possible mechanism for the estab-
lishment of new endemic foci over great distances from where
a multiresistant microorganism was ﬁrst acquired (Bonnedahl,
2011).

As mentioned above another important host of ESBL-E. coli
seems to be a group of rodents namely Norway rats and Black rats
with reports on ESBL producing isolates from different continents
(Literak et al., 2009a; Guenther et al., 2010b; Ho et al., 2011). This
synantropic species can easily pick up human waste and often
interacts with human feces in the sewage system in urban envi-
ronments and can therefore easily acquire multiresistant bacteria.
Interestingly wild boars have also been reported as host s of ESBL-
E. coli in Central Europe, which might reﬂect their omnivorous
feeding behavior (Literak et al., 2009b; Poeta et al., 2009). Other
mammals found to be positive hosts of ESBL producing bacteria
were deer and foxes (Costa et al., 2006). Very recently there has
been a report on a marine ﬁsh, the Gilthead Sea bream (Sousa
et al., 2011) as a carrier of ESBL-E. coli, indicating a dissemination
of ESBL-E. coli into the Atlantic ocean.

A PERSPECTIVE ON ESBL ENZYMES
In parallel to the current situation in human and veterinary medi-
cine the type of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases found in wild
animals are clearly dominated by the blaCTX-M gene-family. With
the exception of one study (Sousa et al., 2011) all wildlife studies

identiﬁed the blaCTX-M genes as the main ESBL enzyme. In 35%
of the studies different SHV enzymes were additionally detected.
As shown in Table 1, most of the studies reported blaCTX-M-1, fol-
lowed by blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-32, and blaCTX-M-9.
Only occasionally blaCTX-M-2, blaCTX-M-13, blaCTX-M-55, and
blaCTX-M-65 were detected (Table 1). Besides the blaCTX-M-type
family only blaSHV-12 and blaTEM-52 were also often detected.
Other less prevalent ESBL genes were blaOXA-1, blaSHV-5, and
blaTEM-20. The spectrum of the different enzyme types found in
wild animals is very narrow compared to clinical isolates of human
and veterinary origin (Pitout, 2010; Smet et al., 2010b). While the
reason for this is unknown, we offer the following hypotheses:
these ﬁndings might simply reﬂect the small number of studies
performed on wildlife so far, or they could indicate that certain
types of beta-lactamases are more successful in the environment,
for example due to co-selection of other non-resistance genes
accompanied by these beta-lactamases. Another explanation could
be that the types of ESBLs found in wild animals simply reﬂect the
ones that are most prevalent in human and veterinary clinics and in
livestock farming, such as blaCTX-M-1 or blaCTX-M-15 (Pitout, 2010;
Smet et al., 2010b). This could lead to the assumption that the situ-
ation we are observing in wild animals is just presenting spill-over
effects from clinics and livestock farming. If this was true, future
studies presumably should ﬁnd a rise in those pandemic CTX-M-
15 types, exempliﬁed by the clonal E. coli lineages of ST131 and
ST648. Several studies observed a similarity in the overall resis-
tance proﬁles of wild animal isolates with human or veterinarian
clinical isolates which supports this hypothesis (Costa et al., 2008;
Literak et al., 2009b; Guenther et al., 2010d). The most preva-
lent non-ESBL resistant phenotype in wildlife E. coli is resistance
to streptomycin, ampicillin, and tetracycline. This pattern is also
very common in human and livestock populations in Europe (Van
Den Bogaard et al., 2000; Guerra et al., 2003). As mentioned above
the types of ESBL genes are basically the same in human, livestock,
and wildlife, which strengthens the hypothesis that wildlife isolates
resemble those found in animal and human patients. However, as
the dissemination of ESBL genes is highly driven by horizontal
gene transfer through plasmids, the occurrence of identical ESBL
genes could also be based on the spread of ESBL-plasmids which
are randomly distributed in the environment. In summary, unrav-
eling the basis of the ESBL-E. coli spill-over into wildlife needs to
include both a characterization of the clonal nature of bacterial
strains isolated from different hosts as well as an accurate iden-
tiﬁcation of the ESBL genes and their episomal or chromosomal
localization.

A ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL PERSPECTIVE
Regarding the basic question of the zoonotic potential of E. coli it
is useful to address the population genetics of this bacterial species.
Besides comparative whole genome analysis of bacteria, this can
also be done by other approaches like Multi-locus sequence typ-
ing (MLST)4. Although it is based on a small set of marker genes
only, this method seems to reﬂect the microevolution of the E.
coli core genome. In general, MLST analysis revealed the exis-
tence of strains belonging to identical sequence types (STs) and

ESBL-E. coli in wildlife

being isolated from different hosts rather being the rule than the
exception. This indicates a common phylogeny and therefore a
zoonotic potential for most strains analyzed so far (Wirth et al.,
2006). Indeed, several research groups found clusters of E. coli
causing systemic infections in birds, and urinary tract infection
and neonatal meningitis in humans, which are genetically so simi-
lar, that a zoonotic potential is foreseen (Johnson and Russo, 2002;
Ewers et al., 2007; Moulin-Schouleur et al., 2007). So far the num-
ber of ESBL-E. coli from wildlife in that global data base is rather
limited. However, if the same clusters of E. coli can cause disease
in humans and domesticated birds, their transmission scenarios
become important and such routes of transfer indeed are a plausi-
ble transfer mechanism of ESBL-E. coli from humans to wild birds
and vice versa.

To answer the question about the similarity of human clinical,
livestock, companion animal, and wildlife ESBL-E. coli isolates we
need to gain insight into the clonal relatedness of isolates from
all these groups. Initial MLST paired with pulsed ﬁeld gel elec-
trophoresis (PFGE) is an ideal tool to reveal clonal relatedness or
even clonal identity of epidemiologically unrelated isolates. This
attempt has been put forward by a small number of studies on wild
birds, all clearly pointing out that similar STs or clonal groups are
present in humans, domestic animals, and wild birds (Bonnedahl
et al., 2009, 2010; Guenther et al., 2010a; Hernandez et al., 2010;
Simoes et al., 2010). Overall up to 35 different STs have been
detected in wild avian ESBL-E. coli (Table 1; Figure 1). Although
some of the “avian” STs appeared twice in different wildlife stud-
ies like ST746 (Bonnedahl et al., 2009; Hernandez et al., 2010) and
have not been detected in human clinical samples yet, the majority
of the STs found in avian ESBL-E. coli, such as ST131, ST10, ST90,
ST648, or ST69, are also present in human clinical isolates.

Figure 1 shows a minimum spanning tree (MSTree) display-
ing human, domestic animal, and wildlife ESBL–STs based on
data of the MLST database5 as of October 2011 and the current
literature on human and animal ESBL-E. coli isolates providing
MLST data (Minarini et al., 2007; Yumuk et al., 2008; Blanco
et al., 2009; Hrabak et al., 2009; Naseer et al., 2009; Oteo et al.,
2009; Sidjabat et al., 2009; Suzuki et al., 2009; Valverde et al.,
2009; Coelho et al., 2010; Doi et al., 2010; Peirano et al., 2010;
Smet et al., 2010a; Zong and Yu, 2010; Ben Slama et al., 2011;

et al., 2011; Van Der Bij et al., 2011; Woerther et al., 2011). In
the MSTree each circle represents a ST and the size of the circle
is proportional to the number of ESBL-E. coli isolates belong-
ing to this ST. Here is becomes remarkably clear that ESBL-E.
coli of wildlife, domestic animal, and human origin share identi-
cal STs suggesting an interspecies transmission of phylogenetically
related multiresistant strains. This hypothesis is further strength-
ened by the detection of the worldwide emerging clonal group of E.
coli speciﬁed as B2-O25b:H4-ST131 in human (Nicolas-Chanoine
et al., 2008), veterinary clinical settings (Ewers et al., 2010), and in
a Glaucous winged gull in Kamchatka (Hernandez et al., 2010).

In another study (Bonnedahl et al., 2010) in south Sweden
ESBL-E. coli of several new STs were detected, including ST1646

which is closely related to ST648 previously also found in wild
birds in Germany (Guenther et al., 2010a) and in humans in Africa,
Asia, and the United States (Doi et al., 2010; Zong and Yu, 2010).
Interestingly, ST648 has been detected as one of the STs associated
with the carriage of the newly emerging carbapenemase NDM-
1 which underlines unforeseeable consequences of the entry of
certain multiresistant clones into wild bird populations (Mushtaq
et al., 2011).

As mentioned above there are currently three studies that pro-
vide evidence for the frequent occurrence of ESBL-E. coli in rats
(Literak et al., 2009a; Guenther et al., 2010b; Ho et al., 2011). How-
ever, comparative data on the clonal relatedness of these isolates

ESBL-E. coli in wildlife

and those of human or domestic animals as assessed by MLST or
PFGE is limited to a single study only (Guenther et al., 2010b). Here
an ESBL-E. coli from a rat belonging to the pandemic clone B2-
O25b:H4-ST131 was detected, which might point toward a direct
transmission from human feces to the rat in an urban sewage
system.

CONCLUSION
The current data on ESBL-E. coli in wild animals reveals that car-
riage of these multiresistant strains is widespread in at least some
wild populations like waterfowl, birds of prey, and rodents, even
though these have never been exposed continuously to antibi-
otics. This clearly undermines the presumption that resistance
will decline with the absence of antibiotic treatment alone. It
underlines the very complex nature of the spread of antimicrobial
resistance which has been also already pointed out for non-beta-
lactam resistance in human populations in remote areas in South
America (Pallecchi et al., 2007; Bartoloni et al., 2009).

The origins of resistance and the selection mechanisms respon-
sible for maintaining high prevalence of resistance are largely
unknown and therefore need to be addressed more soundly
(Gilliver et al., 1999). The common occurrence of ESBL-E. coli in
wildlife, especially in avian hosts, has several implications. Firstly,
wildlife has the potential to serve as an environmental reservoir
and melting pot of bacterial resistance. Secondly by taking into
account the zoonotic potential of E. coli and the concomitant
observation that ESBL-E. coli of wildlife origin are basically the
same than the ones found in clinical isolates they additionally
have the potential to re-infect human populations. Bird’s feces are
omnipresent in urban and rural settings and smear infections of
humans by avian droppings should not be underestimated. Many
bird species, including those that were already identiﬁed as carri-
ers of ESBL-E. coli, display considerable mobility, often involving
the crossing of continents. In the same way the phenomenon of
bird migration creates the potential for the establishment of new
endemic foci of disease along their routes like it has been seen for
the West Nile Virus in the USA (Reed et al., 2003), antimicrobial

hosts. Bird migration could therefore contribute to the dissemina-
tion of resistance over the globe as has previously been observed for
human travelers (Peirano et al., 2011). One might think that this is
of minor impact compared to human travel but we have to keep in
mind that in contrast to the human population there is no sewage
system for bird feces, and droppings are therefore directly exposed
to the environment as well as to human and animal population.

Avian mobility and spread of ESBL-E. coli might also have
unpredictable consequences through possible interactions of these
birds with environmental bacterial ecosystems in remote areas
reached mainly by migrating birds. We have to keep in mind that
the role of antimicrobial substances or their ancestors in natural
ecosystems like soil differs considerably from their antinfective
function in clinical settings. This in turn means that the crosstalk
of bacterial communities in fragile ecosystems could be highly
inﬂuenced by the entry of multiresistant bacteria (Allen et al.,
2010).

Future studies should address whether ESBL-E. coli can persist
in the environment or circulate in animals for long periods and
may thus be disseminated by wildlife and other vectors. The pan-
demic spread of certain ESBL-E. coli lineages into the environment
highlights the complexity of dissemination of antimicrobial drug
resistance. As previously suggested, thorough spatial and tempo-
ral studies of antimicrobial drug resistance in different natural
habitats are warranted (Gilliver et al., 1999; Hernandez et al.,
2010) to fully understand the importance of wildlife as a source of
antimicrobial resistance.
