Abstract: This  study examined the metabolic  activity of pure cultures of five root pathogens commonly found in closed 
hydroponic  cultivation  systems  (Phytophthora  cryptogea  (PC),  Phytophthora  capsici  (PCP),  Pythium  aphanidermatum 
(PA), Fusarium oxysporum  f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL)  and Fusarium solani  (FS)) using sole carbon source utilisa-
tion in order to develop  effective biocontrol  strategies  against these pathogens. Aliquots of 150 μL of  the mycelial  sus-
pension  were  inoculated  in  each  well  of  GN2  microtitre  plates.  On  the  basis  of  average  well  colour  development  and 
number of positive wells, the pathogens were divided into two groups, (i) PA and FORL and (ii) PC, PCP and FS. Group 
(i)  was  characterised  by  a  short  lag-phase,  a  rapid  exponential  phase  involving  almost  all  carbon  sources  offered  and  a 
long stationary phase, while group (ii) had a more extended lag-phase and a slower utilisation rate of the carbon sources 
offered. The three isolates in group (ii) differed significantly during their exponential phase. The lowest utilisation rate of 
carbon  sources  and  number  of  sources  utilised  was  found  for  PCP.  Of  the  major  group  of  carbon  sources,  six  carbohy-
drates, three carboxylic acids and four  amino acids were  rapidly used by all isolates tested at  an early stage. The carbon 
sources  gentibiose,  (cid:1)-D-glucose,  maltose,  sucrose,  D-trehalose,  L-aspartic  acid,  L-glutamic  acid,  L-proline  persisted  to 
the  end  of  the  exponential  phase.Moreover,  similarities  between  the  metabolic  profiles  of  the  tested  pathogen  and  the 
those of the resident microflora could also be found. These findings are of great importance as regards the role of the resi-
dent microflora in the biocontrol.

INTRODUCTION 

  Closed hydroponic growing systems are considered to be 
environmentally  sound  due  to  the  reuse  of  excess  nutrient 
solution  and  easy  management  of  water  and  nutrient  supply 
in  these  systems,  which  decreases  nutrient  leakage  into  the 
environment.  However,  the  spread  of  root-borne  pathogens 
such  as  species  of  Phytophthora,  Pythium  and  Fusarium  in 
these  systems  is  a  matter  of  great  concern  [1].  There  are 
technical  and  biological  methods  available  to  reduce  or 
eliminate the spread of root-borne pathogens with the circu-
lating nutrient solution [2]. However, these do not affect the 
dispersal  of  pathogens  between  plants  connected  to  one  an-
other  through  their  root  system,  i.e.  plants  within  the  same 
slab  or  on  the  same  irrigation  board.  Here,  addition  of  bio-
logical control agents may be an attractive measure.  

 
In  order  to  prevent  dispersal  of  root  pathogens  in  hydro-
ponic  cropping  systems,  early  warning  systems  and  systems 
for  timing  of  biological  control  agents  are  needed. Warning 
systems  operate  by  predicting  an  outbreak  or  disease  inten-
sity  in  cultivation  systems,  host  and/or  pathogen  conditions. 
Information  on  the  behaviour  and  ecology  of  the  pathogens 
is  thus  essential  for  the  development  of  such  systems  and 
thereby  for  effective  biocontrol  strategies  against  root  dis-
eases.

In this initial study, we examined the ability of pure cul-
tures  of  three  oomycetes  and  two  species  of  Fusarium,  all 
prominent  in  hydroponic  systems  with  vegetables  and  ber-
ries, to utilise sole carbon sources. Previous investigations on 
the  functional  diversity  of  the  resident  microflora  in  hydro-
ponic  systems  have  indicated  differences  in  the  metabolic 
profiles affected by plant species and cultivar [3] and by sea-
sonal variations during the cultivation period [4]. Moreover, 
faster  utilisation  of  sole  carbon  sources  by  the  resident  root 
microflora has also been indicated using Biolog GN2 panels 
after  exposure  of  tomato  roots  to  the  fungal  root  pathogen 
Pythium  ultimum  [5].  The  use  of  sole  carbon  source  utilisa-
tion profiles (SCSUP) based on Biolog GN2 panels to assess 
the  metabolic  activity  of  fungal  root  pathogens  as  pure  cul-
tures  is  therefore  of  great  importance  in  discriminating  it 
from the metabolic activity of the resident microflora.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Fungal Cultures 

f.sp. 

radicis-lycopersici 

  The  pathogens  Phytophthora  cryptogea  (isolate  307.62), 
Fusarium  oxysporum 
(isolate 
1011587),  Phytophthora  capsici  (isolate  521.77),  Fusarium 
solani  (isolate  115659)  and  Pythium  aphanidermatum  (iso-
late  634.70)  were  obtained  from  Centraalbureau  voor 
Schimmelcultures (CBS), Baarn, the Netherlands. All patho-
gens  were  maintained  in  the  dark  on  potato  dextrose  agar 
(DIFCO 213400). The plates were incubated at 23oC.  

 
Pure cultures of these pathogens were cultivated on PDA 
plates  for  two  weeks.  For  harvesting  of  the  cultures,  10  mL

of  0.85%  sterile  NaCl  were  added  to  the  plates  before  abra-
sion.  Ten  plates  (replicates)  were  used  for  each  fungal  spe-
cies.  

Carbon Source Utilisation 

  Utilisation  of  organic  compounds  was  studied  on  Mi-
crolog  GN2  panels  (Biolog,  Haywood,  CA,  USA).  The  96 
wells  of  the  microtitre  plates  contain  a  low  concentration, 
buffered  nutrient  medium,  a  carbon  source  (except  the  con-
trol  well)  and  the  redox  dye  tetrazolium.  According  to  [6], 
the carbon compounds in the GN2 panel can be divided into 
11  groups:  alcohols,  amides,  amines,  amino  acids,  aromatic 
compounds,  brominated  compounds,  carbohydrates,  carbox-
ylic  acids,  esters,  phosphorylated  compounds  and  polymers. 
The redox dye tetrazolium is soluble in water in its oxidised 
state  and  appears  colourless.  Through  microbial  respiration, 
tetrazolium  blue  is  reduced  to  the  insoluble  violet  formazan 
complex, irreversibly deposited inside the bacterial cell [7]. 

  Aliquots  of  0.5  mL  of  the  mycelial  suspension  were  re-
suspended  in  0.85%  NaCl  andadjusted  to  OD590  0.100  ± 
0.098. Aliquots of 150 μL were inoculated into each well of 
GN2  microtitre  plates.  The  plates  were  incubated  at  room 
temperature  and  utilisation  of  the  sole  compounds  was 
measured  spectrophotometrically  by  recording  the  colour 
change of the redox dye tetrazolium at 590 nm, using a com-
puter-integrated  microtitre  plate  reader  (Digiscan,  Asys, 
Linz,  Austria;  software:  Digiwin),  directly  afterinoculation 
and  after  4,  18,  24,  36,  48,  60,  72,  96,  120,  144,  168,  192, 
216, 240 and 264 h of incubation.  

CALCULATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES 

 
In  analysis  of  carbon  source  utilisation,  no  adjustment 
was  made  for  negative  values.  The  measured  values  from 
carbon utilisation can be separated into different hierarchical 
levels.  Here,  utilisation  of  the  whole  panel,  utilisation  of 
groups of compounds and utilisation of single C sources was 
examined  as  previously  described  by  [8].  The  average  well 
colour  development  (AWCD,  expressing  the  sum  of  absor-
bance  units  of  all  96  wells  divided  by  the  total  number  of 
wells)  and  the  number  of  positive  wells  (defined  as  wells  in 
which  mean  OD590  nm  was  twice  as  high  as  OD590  nm  in  the 
control  well)  with  an  absorbance  level  >0.5  per  microtitre 
plate  were  calculated.  Furthermore,  the  average  well  colour 
development  of  the  total  per  group  of  substrates  (AWCDG, 
expressing  the  sum  of  absorbance  units  of  individual  sub-
strate sets divided by the number of compounds belonging to 
the  substrate  group),  and  the  ratios  of  actual  and  potentially 
positive  wells  belonging  to  the  same  substrate  group  were 
calculated. All data were analysed for each isolate and read-
ing time by one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance), consid-
ering  LSD  (least  significant  difference  method/Fisher´s 
LSD)  with  p<0.05  as  significance  level  (Minitab  statistical 
software, release 15 for Windows, State College, Pennsylva-
nia). 

 
Functional  profiles  were  analysed  at  three  cardinal 
points:  (i)  during  lag-phase  (36  h),  (ii)  at  the  end  of  the  ex-
ponential phase (96 h) and (iii) at the end of the observation 
period  (264  h),  using  cluster  analysis  with  single  linkages 
and  Euclidean  (Minitab  statistical  software,  release  15  for 
Windows, State College, Pennsylvania) distance and canoni-
cal  discriminant  analysis  (SAS,  version  9.1,  SAS  Institute 

Khalil and Alsanius 

Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA,  licensed  by  Uppsala  University).  Ca-
nonical  discriminant  analysis  involves  a  mathematical  pro-
cedure that reduces data dimensionality by performing a co-
variance analysis between factors. The first function, canoni-
cal function 1 (Can 1), accounts for as much of the variation 
in  the  data  as  possible,  and  each  succeeding  function  ac-
counts for as much of the remaining variation as possible. 

RESULTS 

  The  overall  results  on  AWCD  and  number  of  positive 
wells allowed the five isolates to be divided into two groups, 
comprising (i) Pythium aphanidermatum (PA) and Fusarium 
oxysporum  f.sp.  radicis-lycopersici  (FORL)  and  (ii)  Phy-
tophthora  cryptogea  (PC),  P.  capsici  (PCP)  and  Fusarium 
solani (FS) (Fig. 1). Group (i) distinguished itself by a short 
lag-phase,  a  rapid  exponential  phase  involving  almost  all 
carbon  sources  offered  and  a  long  stationary  phase.  During 
the  exponential  phase,  the  two  isolates  differed  significantly 
and FORL terminated its exponential phase 24 h earlier than 
PA. The three isolates in group (ii) had a slower rate of utili-
sation  of  the  carbon  sources  offered,  with  a  more  extended 
lag  phase  in  terms  of  both  AWCD  and  number  of  positive 
wells  compared  with  group  (i).  These  three  isolates  differed 
significantly during their exponential phase. The lowest utili-
sation of carbon sources and number of sources utilised was 
found for PCP.

cant  differences  between  the  three  metabolically  less  active 
isolates.  This  ranking  was  also  supported  by  the  third  major 
group  of  compounds,  aromatic  and  amino  acids,  with  PCP 
distinguished  by  its  substantially  low  utilisation  of  these 
compounds.  At  the  end  of  the  observation  period  only  40% 
of  the  compounds  offered  were  used  by  PC.  Table  1  shows 
the overall results from the compound groups on the basis of 
AWCDG. 

  When  comparing  the  three  most  common  compound 
groups,  carbohydrates,  carboxylic  and  amino  acids,  seven 
compounds showed high extinction values for all fungal iso-
lates  tested,  namely  gentiobiose,  (cid:1)-D-glucose,  D-trehalose, 
(cid:1)-hydroxy-butyric  acid,  L  glutamic  acid,  L-proline  and  L-
serine. At an early stage (36 h after incubation) six carbohy-
drates  (gentiobiose,  (cid:1)-D-glucose,  maltose,  D-raffinose,  su-
crose, D- trehalose), three carboxylic acids (cis-aconitic acid, 
D,  L-lactic  acid,  succinic  acid)  and  four  amino  acids  (L-
alanyl-glycine,  L-aspartic  acid,  L-glutamic  acid,  L-proline) 
had  been  consumed  by  all  isolates  tested.  However,  genti-
biose, (cid:1)-D-glucose, maltose, sucrose, D-trehalose, L-aspartic 
acid,  L-glutamic  acid,  L-proline  persisted  to  the  end  of  the 
exponential phase.  

  Cluster  analyses  conducted  on  data  obtained  at  the  three 
cardinal points during the observation period grouped all five 
isolates. However, the similarity within PA was weaker than 
for all other isolates on any of these three occasions. After 36 
h  the  similarity  between  PA  and  FORL  was  low,  and  these 
two  isolates  also  deviated  strongly  from  PC,  PCP  and  FS 
(Fig.  2).  At  later  readings,  the  similarity  between  PA  and 
FORL increased substantially. 

  At all three cardinal points, the five isolates could be dis-
tinctly  differentiated  (Fig.  3).  The  most  distinct  groupings 
were  found  at  the  transition  from  lag  to  exponential  phase 
(36 h) and from exponential to stationary phase (96 h). After 
96  h  of  incubation,  canonical  function  1  discriminated  be-

tween PC, FS, PCP and PA, FORL, which in turn were sepa-
rated by canonical function 2.  

  On  the  basis  of  discriminant  analyses  (DA)  executed  for 
the three cardinal points, the following compounds separated 
the  isolates:  After  36  h:  glycogen,  i-erythritol,  D-melibiose, 
D-psicose, turanose, citric acid, p-hydroxy phenylacetic acid, 
(cid:1)-ketoglutaric  acid,  quinic  acid;  after  96  h:  i-erythritol,  L-
fucose,  D-psicose,  cis-aconitic  acid,  D-galactonic  acid,  D-
galacturonic  acid,  (cid:1)-hydroxybutyric  acid,  p-hydroxy  pheny-
lacetic  acid,  D,  L  lactic  acid,  malonic  acid;  and  after  264  h: 
N-acetyl-D-galactosamine,  D-arabinose,  i-erythriol,  xylitol, 
citric acid, D-galacturonic acid, sebacic acid, glucuronamide, 
L-ornithine,  phenylethylamine.  The  compound  i-erythritol 
overlapped  as  a  decisive  compound  on  all  three  reading  oc-
casions. D-psicose and phenylacetic acid occurred decisively 
after  36  and  96  h  of  incubation,  whereas  citric  acid  was 
found  decisively  both  at  early  and  late  stages  of  utilisation. 
D-galacturonic  acid  was  a  decisive  compound  at  the  two 
later cardinal points, 96 h and 144 h. 

DISCUSSION 

 
Information  on  the  ecological  requirements  of  root 
pathogens  in  closed  hydroponic  systems  is  a  key  factor  that 
could support the development of effective biocontrol strate-
gies in these systems. Analysis of sole carbon source utilisa-
tion profiles (SCSUP) provides an indication about the capa-
bility of the community to adapt its metabolism [6]. Moreo-
ver,  evaluation  of  the  metabolic  capability  of  pathogen,  an-
tagonist  and  resident  microflora  can  reveal  evidence  of  any 
direct  competition  if  these  microorganisms  show  similar 
affinities to sole carbon sources.  

  Many  investigations  using  this  technique  have  been  per-
formed for characterising complex communities from differ-
ent  environments,  but  few  studies  document  the  functional 
diversity of fungal communities in general and those of fun-

gal  pathogens  in  particular.  However,  a  specific  panel  for 
filamentous  fungi  has  been  developed  by  Biolog  Inc.  In  the 
present study, we disregarded this type of panel, as we aimed 
to use the present data for comparison with previous SCSUP  

from  hydroponic  greenhouse  systems  [3-5]  and  with  the  
biocontrol  agents  [9].  On  the  basis  of  AWCD  and  positive 
wells,  the  root  pathogens  PA  and  FORL  yielded  a  greater 
metabolic  response  than  PC,  PCP  and  FS  (Fig.  1).  This 
might  indicate  their  rapid  adaptation  to  the  high  substrate 

concentrations in the microplates in the form of fast growth, 
depleting  most  of  the  substrate.  The  short  lag  phase  (Fig. 1) 
of  these  pathogens  also  indicates  efficient  utilisation  of  car-
bon  sources.  As  regards  rhizobacterial  communities,  previ-
ous  investigations  [10]  showed  that  the  populations  that  de-
velop  in  Biolog  plates  are  largely  fast-growing  species

Fig.  (3).  Discriminant  analysis  of  sole  carbon  source  utilisation  by  pure  cultures  of  Phytophthora  cryptogea  (PC),  Phytophthora  capsici 
(PCP), Pythium aphanidermatum (PA), Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) and Fusarium  solani  (FO)  after 36 , 96 and 
264 h of incubation on Biolog GN2 panels. Can 1 and can 2= canonical functions 1 and 2. 

and L-serine, maltose, D-raffinose, sucrose, D-trehalose, cis-
aconitic  acid,  D,  L-lactic  acid,  succinic  acid,  L-alanyl-
glycine,  L-aspartic  acid)  were  carbon  sources  utilised  by  all 
pathogens tested (Table 1). In previous studies, these carbon 
sources  were  among  those  identified  as  being  related  to  the 
utilisation  pattern  of  Pythium  oligandrum  [11],  Pythium  ul-
timum  [12],  Pythium  arrhenomanes,  Pythium  myriotylum 
and Pythium dissotocum [13]. However, little is known about 
the  SCSUP  of  the  root  pathogens  belonging  to  the  fungal 
groups  Fusarium  and  Phytophthora.  Some  studies  have  re-
ported  that  the  carbon  sources  glucose,  fructose  and  sucrose 

are  needed  for  the  growth  of Phytophthora  capsici  [14]  and 
that  fructose,  mannose  and  galactose  are  needed  for  the 
growth of Fusarium solani [15]. The results from the present 
study  showed  that  the  pathogens  belonging  to  the  fungal 
groups  Fusarium  and  Phytophthora  utilised  not  only  carbo-
hydrates  but  also  alcohols,  esters,  carboxylic  and  amino  ac-
ids (Table 1).  

 
Furthermore, SCSUP of the resident microflora [3, 4] has 
indicated higher utilisation of carbohydrates and amino acids 
by  the  microbial  communities  on  young  and  old  roots  re-

spectively.  Substantial  use  of  amino  acids  has  also  been 
found for Trichoderma spp., Gliocladium sp. and Streptomy-
ces  griseoviridis  in  commercial  biocontrol  products  [9]. 
Similarities  in  the  SCSUP  between  the  pathogens,  resident 
microflora  and  biocontrol  agents  might  indicate  direct  com-
petition between these strains for carbon sources. This would 
thereby  leads  to  difficulties  in  discriminating  the  metabolic 
profiles  of  the  pathogens  from  those  of  the  resident  micro-
flora  or  the  introduced  biocontrol  agents  as  it  was  expected 
in  our  purpose  of  the  study.  Furthermore,  both  cluster  and 
discriminate  analysis  (Figs.  2  and  3)  separated  the  root 
pathogens  PA  and  FORL  compared  with  PC,  PCP  and  FS, 
indicating  differences  in  carbon  source  utilisation  ability 
between  the  fungal  pathogens  PA  and  FORL  compared  to 
PC, PCP and FS. Furthermore, the results might also indicate 
similarities in the metabolic activity between PA and FORL. 
Discrimination  between  different  pathogens  during  an  early 
growth  stage  might  also  provide  the  potential  for  using 
SCSUP-based  data  for  the  development  of  early  warning 
systems in closed hydroponics.
