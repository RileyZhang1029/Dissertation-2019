Abstract: The  cells of innate and adaptive immunity, although activated by different ligands,  engage in  cross talk to en-
sure a successful immune outcome. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune system and have 
the ability to detect microbial infection and trigger host defence  responses. Otherwise, human T lymphocytes  are able  to 
produce  most  TLRs.  Thus,  we  analyze  the  capability  of  some  TLR  ligands  to  modulate  the  function  of  highly-purified 
CD4+  T  cells.  We  found  that  agents  acting  via  TLRs  (poly  I:C,  a  TLR3  ligand;  flagellin,  a  TLR5  ligand;  and  R848,  a 
TLR7/8  ligand)  are  able  to  regulate  the  expression  of  costimulatory  molecules  both  on  purified  antigen  presenting  cells 
and on purified T lymphocytes. Moreover, the activation mediated by TLRs determines a kinetic  expression of B7-family 
members such as through an inhibition of T lymphocytes delayed proliferation. These findings suggest a functional role of 
some invading microorganisms in regulating acquired immunity. 

Key Words: B7-family receptors; T lymphocytes; Toll-like receptors. 

INTRODUCTION 

Host  defense  against  invading  microbial  pathogens  is 
elicited  by  the  immune  system:  innate  and  acquired  immu-
nity.  Both  components  of  immunity  recognize  invading  mi-
croorganisms  as  non-self,  which  triggers  immune  responses 
to  eliminate  them.  In  acquired  immunity  B  and  T  lympho-
cytes  utilize  antigen  receptors  such  as  immunoglobulins  and 
T cell receptors to recognize the non-self.  

At  the  end  of  the  20th  century,  Toll  was  shown  to  be  an 
essential receptor for host defense against fungal infection in 
Drosophila, which only has innate immunity [1]. Soon after, 
a  mammalian  homolog  of  the  Toll  receptor  (now  termed 
Toll-like receptor-4, TLR4) was shown to induce expression 
of genes involved in inflammatory responses [1]. These stud-
ies lead  innate  immunity to become a very attractive subject 
of research. To date, at least eleven members of the Toll fam-
ily have been identified [2]. This type I transmembrane pro-
teins family is characterized by an extracellular domain with 
leucine-rich  repeats  and  a  cytoplasmic  domain  with  homol-
ogy  to  the  type  I  IL-receptor.  Functionally,  a  critical  role  of 
TLR4 when recognizing the microbial component (i.e. LPS) 
was  initially  characterized.  TLR4  physically  associates  with 
another molecule called MD-2, along with CD14. This com-
plex is responsible for LPS recognition and signalling [3].  

In this article, we focus our attention on some of the other 
TLR  family  members  such  as  the  TLR3  which  recognizes 
double stranded (ds) RNA and induces both the activation of 
NF-kB  through  MyD88-dependent  and  independent  path-
ways  and  the  production  of  type  I  interferons  (IFN-(cid:1)/(cid:2))  [4, 
5]. TLR4, as well as TLR2, are pattern recognition receptors 
and signal molecules in response to bacterial lipoproteins and

have  been  implicated  in  innate  immunity  and  inflammation  
[6]. TLR5 recognizes bacterial flagellin [7]. TLR7 and TLR8  
are  structurally  highly  conserved  proteins,  and  recognize  a  
nucleic acid-like structure of the virus [8].   

Costimulatory  molecules  are  considered  as  critical  in  
eliciting  cellular  proliferation  and  cytokine  production  upon  
stimulation.  Our  knowledge  of  the  signals  mediated  through 
B7 family molecules (CD80, CD86, B7-H1 and B7-DC) and 
their  corresponding  receptors  (CD28,  CD152,  and  PD-1) 
have become more complex and it is now clear that they play 
critical roles in immune regulation. CD28 is present on rest-
ing  T  cells  and  is  therefore  likely  to  be  related  to  initial 
costimulatory  activity.  CD152  (CTLA-4)  is  an  inducible  in-
hibitory  receptor  homologous  to  CD28  and  its  engagement 
triggers  phosphatases  which  dephosphorylate  molecules  of 
the  CD3/TCR  activation  cascade.  Conversely,  blockade  of 
CD152  by  specific  mAb  increases  proliferation  of  CD4+  T 
cell  blasts  and  clones  [9-13].    CD152  mRNA  is  detectable 
within  one  hour  after  T  cell  activation  and  cell  surface  ex-
pression of the protein, although weak, reaches a peak one to 
three days later [14].  In addition, the engagement of CD152 
inhibits  specific  target  cell  lysis  mediated  by  CD8+  T  lym-
phocytes [15], down-regulates proliferation of T cells as well 
as IL-2, IFN-(cid:3), IL-4, and IL-13 production, and up-regulates 
the  production  of  IL-10  and  TGF-(cid:2)  [16].  PD-1  is  expressed 
by  B  cells,  T  lymphocytes  (activated  but  not  resting),  and 
myeloid cells, in contrast to the more restricted expression of 
CD28 and CD152. PD-1 is also expressed in the thymus pri-
marily  on  CD4–CD8–  T  cells,  during  this  transition  from 
double  negative  to  double  positive  [17].  B7-H1  binds  its  re-
ceptor  PD-1  along  with  another  ligand,  B7-DC.  The  overall 
expression  of  B7-H1  and  B7-DC  transcripts  is  similarly  
found  in  various  lymphoid  and  non-lymphoid  tissues,  
whereas  the  expression  profiles  of  their  proteins  are  quite  
distinct [18-22].                                                                       

The  immunomodulating  activity  of  bacterial  components  

may  be  related  to  their  ability  to  induce  expression  of  reac-

tive molecules on responding cells. For this reason,  we veri-
fied the in vitro capacity of flagellin, poly (I:C) and R848 to 
induce  the  expression  of  the  costimulatory  molecules,  such 
as  CD80,  CD86,  B7-H1,  B7-DC  on  DC  and  CD28,  CD152, 
PD-1  on  T  cells.  The  further  understanding  of  these  path-
ways  will  create  new  and  exciting  possibilities  for  therapeu-
tic fine-tuning of the immune system. 

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY 

anti-mouse  (GAM)  antiserum  (Southern  Biotechnology  As-
sociates, Birmingham, AL, USA). 

Quantification of IFN-(cid:1). 

The level of IFN-(cid:1) in the supernatant was measured using 
an  ELISA  kit  according  to  the  manufacture’s  protocol 
(Alexis-Italia,  Milano,  Italy).  The  deviation  between  tripli-
cates was <10% for any reported value. 

Cell Cultures 

Mixed Leukocyte Reaction 

Human  peripheral  blood  samples  were  obtained  from 
healthy  donors  according  to  institutional  guidelines.  Periph-
eral  Blood  Mononuclear  Cells  (PBMC)  were  purified  by 
Ficoll-Hypaque  density  gradient  centrifugation.  Monocytes 
and CD4+ T lymphocytes were isolated by positive selection 
with  magnetic  beads  coated  with  mAb  to  CD14  and  CD4 
(MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA). To induce DC 
differentiation,  purified  monocytes  were  cultured  for  4  days 
in  the  presence  of  200  ng/ml  rhGM-CSF  (Shering-Plough 
Research  Institute,  Kenilworth,  NJ)  and  10ng/ml  rhIL-4 
(Immunotools, Friesoythe, Germany). These cells are termed 
immature  DCs.  Cells  were  cultured  in  RPMI  1640  supple-
mented  with  10%  heat-inactivated  FCS,  5  mM  L-glutamine 
and  50  IU/ml  penicillin-streptomycin  (from  here  on  referred 
to as complete medium).  

Antibodies 

The  following  mAbs  were  used  for  immunophenotypic 
and functional analyses: anti-human B7-DC, anti-human PD-
1    (clone  MIH  18,  and  clone  JI16  eBiosciences,  San  Diego, 
CA,  USA);  PE-conjugated  anti-HLA-DR,  anti-CD80,  anti-
CD86  and  anti-CD152  (BD  Pharmingen,  San  Diego,  CA, 
USA). Anti-CD28 mAb was a gift from D. Olive (Marseille, 
France).  

In Vitro Stimulation  

The  activating  factors  used  in  the  final  concentrations 
were the following: 10 ng/ml Flagellin from S. thyphimurium 
(InvivoGen,  San  Diego,  CA,  USA);  1  μg/ml  LPS  from  Es-
cherichia  coli,  serotype  RE515  (referred  to  as  LPS-RE515, 
Alexis-Italy,  Florence,  Italy)  or  1  μg/ml  Escherichia  coli 
LPS  (referred  to  as  LPS,  Sigma-Aldrich,  Milan,  Italy);  25 
μg/ml  poly  (I:C)  (Polyinosinic:polycytidylic  acid;  Sigma-
Aldrich);  and  10  μM  R-848  (imidazoquinoline  resiquimod; 
GLSynthesis,  Worcester,  MA,  USA).  All  of  these  TLR 
ligands  were  previously  tested  in  order  to  obtain  doses  that 
repeatedly  generate  the  same  maximum  response  (data  not 
shown). While studying the activation of DCs via TLR, sev-
eral  samples  were  treated  with  7.5  μg/ml  rabbit  anti-human 
IFN-(cid:1)  antibody  (Prodotti  Gianni,  Milan,  Italy)  to  neutralize 
the  IFN-(cid:1).  DCs  and  T  lymphocytes  were  collected  after  24, 
48  and  72 hrs,  and  cell  surface  markers  were  tested  by  flow 
cytometry.  

Flow Cytometry 

The surface phenotype of monocyte-derived DCs was as-
sessed  by  flow  cytometric  analysis  (FACSCalibur,  Becton 
Dickinson).  The  secondary  reagent  was  PE-labelled  goat 

Two-way  MLR  was  used  to  test  functional  activity  fol-
lowing  the  activation  via  TLR.  The  cells  used  in  these  ex-
periments were extracted from a panel of HLA typed labora-
tory  volunteers  and  were  selected  to  provide  two  HLA-DR 
mismatches.  DCs  and  T  lymphocytes  were  pre-treated  for 
three days, as previously described. After in vitro stimulation 
DCs  and  T  lymphocytes  were  harvested,  washed,  and  resus-
pended in complete medium. Then 105 purified allogeneic T 
cells were harvested, washed, and incubated with 104 DCs in 
a  0.2  ml  volume  in  96-well  round-bottom  plates  with  5% 
CO2  at  37°C.  Triplicate  cultures  were  set  up  and  incubated 
for  5  days.  The  cultures  were  then  pulsed  with  0.5  mCi  3H-
thymidine and harvested 18 h later. 

Neutralizing  anti-human-CD80,  -CD86,  -CD152,  -B7-
H1, B7-DC, PD-1 mAb, and irrelevant isotype-matched con-
trol mAb were added into the MLR as indicated.  

Statistical Analyses 

Statistical  analyses  were  performed  in  Microsoft  Excel 
5.0 (Microsoft) using two-tailed Student’s t tests. The p value 
<0.05 was considered statistically significant. 

RESULTS 

Flagellin,  LPS,  poly  (I:C)  and  R848  are  able  to  regulate 
the  expression  of  co-stimulatory  receptors  on  the  membrane 
of T lymphocytes.  

First,  we  analysed  the  effect  of  TLR  stimulation  on 
freshly  isolated  CD4+  T  lymphocytes  (Fig. 1).  Results  show 
that  the  stimulation  leads  to  a  decrease  of  CD28  expression, 
whereas  the  CD152  and  PD-1  expression  increases  after  72 
hrs  of  treatment  (Fig.  1A).  In  addition,  expression  of  CD69 
was evaluated as a positive control of activation. 

The kinetic of CD28 molecules expression shows that the 
greatest  decrease  is  reached  after  72  hrs  of  stimulation  (Fig. 
1B).  Interestingly,  the  CD152  reaches  its  maximum  expres-
sion  on  the  membrane  of  T  cells  after  48  hrs  of  stimulation, 
whereas the maximum for PD-1 is achieved after 72 hrs (Fig. 
1C). In addition, the expression of these inhibitory molecules 
rapidly decreases after 96 hrs (data not shown). 

Although gene knockout mouse demonstrates that TLR-4 
is  the  key  receptor  of  LPS  [23],  in  vitro  transfection  assay 
shows  that  many  commercial  preparations  of  LPS  [24-25] 
including  the  E.  coli  LPS  from  Sigma  [26]  possess  both 
TLR-4  and  TLR-2  activities.  For  this  reason  we  utilized 
LPS-RE515,  a  strong  activator  of  TLR-4,  that  does  not  acti-
vate TLR-2 or other TLRs [27]. As can be depicted from Fig. 
1A,  LPS  modulates  the  expression  of  co-stimulatory  mole-

Human CD4+ T lymphocytes, purified from peripheral blood cells, were cultured as described in Materials and Methods.  
Panel A. Shows that T cells activation via TLRs is able to up-regulate the expression of CD152 and PD-1 at the membrane cell level. Expres-
sion of CD69 was a positive control for T lymphocytes activation. Numbers indicate the Mean Fluorescence Intensity of each curve. 
Panel B. The expression of CD28 decreases following treatment of T cells with flagellin, poly (I:C) and R848. Data  are shown as means ± 
standard deviations (error bars) of five experiments. 
Panel C. Shows the increasing of respectively CD152 and PD-1 expression. It is interesting to note that CD152 reaches the maximum of ex-
pression after 48 hrs, whereas PD-1 after 72 hrs. Data are shown as means ± standard deviations (error bars) of five experiments.

cules  on  T  lymphocytes,  whereas  LPS-RE515  was  slightly 
less  effective.  Thus,  we  could  presume  these  effects  were  a 
result  of  a  specific  activation  via  TLR-2  ligand,  excluding  a 
role mediated by TLR-4 [28-29].  

Figure 2B shows both the kinetic of the CD86 expression 
over a period of 72 hrs and the increasing of the mean fluo-
rescence intensity of differently treated DC stained with anti-
CD80, -B7-H1 and -B7-DC mAb also over a 72 hrs period. 

Flagellin, LPS, poly (I:C) and R848 can regulate the ex-
pression of co-stimulatory molecules on the DC membrane.  

Fresh  monocytes,  isolated  by  positive  selection  using 
magnetic  beads  coated  with  anti-CD14  mAb,  were  cultured 
for 4 days with GM-CSF and IL-4 (immature DCs, iDC), and 
further  stimulated  for  up  to  3  days  with  flagellin,  LPS,  poly 
(I:C)  and  R848  (mature  DCs,  mDC).  We  analyzed  the  ex-
pression of  CD80, CD86,  B7-H1 and  B7-DC at  the  cell sur-
face level of iDC and mDC (Fig. 2A). The experiment shown 
represents  the study of five donors. The iDC expressed very 
low  amount  of  B7  family  receptors  and  CD80  was  the  most 
represented  (Fig.  2A).    In  addition,  our  results  demonstrate 
that  flagellin,  LPS,  poly  (I:C)  and  R848  selectively  up-
regulate  the  expression of all tested costimulatory molecules 
on  mDC,  although  poly  (I:C)  seems  to  have  a  greater  effect 
on the induction of B7 family member expressions (compare 
different  rows  in  Fig.  2A).  Expression  of  HLA-DR  was 
evaluated through positive control of activation,  

Effect  of  IFN-(cid:3)  Neutralization  on  the  Expression  of  Co-
Stimulatory Molecules 

Viral,  as  well  as  bacteria,  infections  induce  innate  im-
mune  responses  including  the  production  of  type  I  interfer-
ons, IFN-(cid:1)/(cid:2). Thus, these agents could induce costimulatory 
molecules  up-regulation  in  response  to  type  I  interferon  sig-
nalling. Otherwise, up-regulation of costimulatory molecules 
on airway epithelium does not seem to depend on these inte-
ferons  [29].  For  this  reason,  we  measured  IFN-(cid:3)  concentra-
tion  in  the  supernatant  of  activated  DC  (Fig.  3A).  The  con-
centration  of  IFN-(cid:3)  was  markedly  increased  in  the  super-
natant  of  TLR-stimulated  cells  up  to  448  pg/ml  (stimulation 
via  poly  (I:C),  compared  with  that  of  unstimulated  cells). 
Interestingly,  although  the  pretreatment  of  cell  culture  with 
saturing  amount  of  anti-IFN-(cid:3)  antibody  completely  neutral-
ized  IFN-(cid:3)  in  the  supernatant,  it  failed  to  suppress  the  TLR-
induced upregulation of B7-H1 and B7-DC on DC (Fig. 3B).

Dendritic cells (DC) were obtained by in vitro differentiation of monocytes. For cellular stimulations, DC were cultured for 24, 48 and 72hrs 
with medium alone or in the presence of different stimuli.

sion of B7-family members on mature DC  (mDC)  after 72 hrs of  treatment with  flagellin, poly  (I:C)  and R848 respectively. Expression of 
MHC-Class II was a positive control for iDC activation. 
Panel B. Only the kinetic of CD86 expression is shown, whereas the expression of the other costimulatory molecules is displayed at the best 
time point (72 hrs). Data  are  expressed as increasing of Mean fluorescence intensity. Data  are  shown as means  ± standard deviations (error

The  Interaction  of  CD152  and  PD-1  with  Their  Natural 
Ligands Inhibits T Cell Proliferation 

Because  TLRs  ligation  induced  the  expression  of  co-
stimulatory  molecules  on  DC  as  well  as  the  expression  of 

inhibitory  receptors  on  T  cells,  we  next  examined  the  im-
munoregulatory  properties  of  flagellin,  LPS,  poly  (I:C),  and 
R848 by determining their effects on two-way MLR. Results 
are shown in Fig. 4A. Only the pre-treatment of DCs and T

with saturing amount of anti-IFN-b antibody failed to suppress the TLR-induced upregulation of B7-H1 and B7-DC on iDC. Data are shown 
as means ± standard deviations (error bars) of five experiments. 
 
lymphocytes with the TLR-acting agents evidence a decrease 
of  thymidine  incorporation.  Otherwise,  T  lymphocytes  and 
DCs,  not  pre-activated  via  TLRs,  added  to  the  double-MLR 
assay were able to normally proliferate (Fig. 4A). Finally, in 
order to evidence the role played by CD152 and PD-1 recep-
tors in inhibiting T cell proliferation, we set up a similar ex-
periment adding a cocktail of mAb specific to CD80, CD86, 
CD152  and  B7-H1,  B7-DC,  PD-1.  Results  (Fig.  4B)  proved 
that  the  interfering  mAb  reconstitute  the  normal  ability  of  T 
cells  to  proliferate.  These  results  were  obtained  independ-
ently  when  the  cocktail  mAb  used  were  directed  to  the  in-
hibitory  receptors  (i.e.  CD152  or  PD-1)  or  to  their  ligands 
(i.e. CD80, CD86, B7-H1 or B7-DC). Thus it seems that the 
interaction  between  inhibitory  receptors  and  ligands  is 
blocked by these mAb. Furthermore, the adding to the prolif-
eration  test  of  isolated  mAb  showed  a  partial  reconstitution 
effect  (data  not  shown).  Thus,  the  inhibitory  effect  seems  to 
be  related  principally  to  the  induction  of  the  expression  of 
these  B7-family  members  on  the  membrane  level  in  this  ex-
perimental model. 

ized.  However,  these  receptors  are  present  only  in  verte-
brates,  and  therefore  we  do  not  fully  understand  the  mecha-
nism for non-self recognition in invertebrate organisms. The 
important  role  of  individual  TLRs  during  innate  immunity 
has  been  established,  above  all  in  recognizing  specific  mi-
crobial components derived from pathogens including bacte-
ria, fungi, protozoa and viruses and in inducing antimicrobial 
immune  response  and  furthermore,  activation  of  innate  im-
munity  is  a  critical  step  to  the  development  of  antigen-
specific acquired immunity [30-31]. 

DCs  are  central  to T  lymphocyte  activation and differen-
tiation  into  T  helper  and  cytotoxic  T  lymphocyte  effectors. 
The  generation  of  acquired  immunity  begins  with  DCs  cap-
turing  microbial  antigens  in  the  peripheral  tissues.  Subse-
quently, DCs migrate to the draining lymph nodes to present 
the processed peptides to naïve T lymphocytes in the context 
of  MHC  molecules.  Once  inside  the  lymph  nodes,  DCs  mi-
grate to the T cell areas, seek out antigen-specific T cells and 
induce  their  activation  and  differentiation  into  effector  cells. 
This  migration  is  mediated  by  TLR-induced  downregulation 
of inflammatory chemokine receptors and upregulation of the 
receptors for lymphoid chemokines [32-34].    

DISCUSSION 

The  immunomodulating  activity  of  bacterial  components 
may  be  related  to  their  ability  to  induce  expression  of  reac-
tive  molecules  on  responding  cells.  The  mechanisms  by 
which  the  antigen  receptors  recognize  foreign  antigens  have 
been  intensively  analyzed,  and  the  major  mechanisms,  such 
as diversity, clonality and memory, have been well character-

Signals  through  TLRs  generally  result  in  the  activation 
and maturation of all DCs, as measured by enhanced expres-
sion of the costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and CD40. 
Induction  of  the  costimulatory  molecules  expression  on  the 
surface  of  DCs  is  a  particularly  important  step  in  the  initia-
tion  of  acquired  immunity.  The  originally  described  mem-

Panel A. Pre-treatment of DC and T cells with agents  acting via TLRs is able to significatively inhibit a two-way MLR. A positive  control

Panel B. A cocktail of mAb specific for the B7/CD28-family members added to the assay is able to revert the capability of T lymphocytes to 
proliferate. In addition, the presence of a cocktail of irrelevant isotype-matched mAb does not perturbate the inhibitory effect observed.  The 
averages ± standard deviations (error bars) of three different experiments are shown. Similar results were obtained in three separate experi-
ments from a variety of donor/recipient combinations.

CD152 [35]. While B7-1 and B7-2 were once thought to rep-
resent  the  major  source  of  signal  2  by  DCs,  the  recent  dis-
covery  of  additional  B7  family  members  highlights  the  mo-
lecular  complexity  of  costimulation.  The  overall  expression 
of B7-H1 and B7-DC transcripts is similarly found in various 
lymphoid  and  non-lymphoid  tissues,  whereas  the  expression 
profiles of their proteins are quite distinct. The expression of 
B7-H1  protein,  although  virtually  absent  in  normal  tissues 
except for macrophage-like cells, could be induced in a vari-
ety  of  tissues  and  cell  types,  such  as  APCs,  B  cells,  T  cells, 
epithelial  cells,  muscle  cells,  trophoblast,  endothelial  cells 
and tumour cells. In contrast, expression of B7-DC was only 
detected  on  DCs  and  monocytes.  B7-H1  was  first  identified 
as  a  T  cell  costimulatory  molecule  that  augments  human  T 
cell proliferation and IL-10 secretion in the presence of either 
anti-CD3 or  alloantigens  [36-37]. B7-DC was also found to 
have  similar  functions  in  vitro  [38].  However,  the  receptor 
PD-1  is  believed  to  be  an  inhibitory  receptor  because  of  its 
phenotypes  of  lymphoproliferative/autoimmune  diseases  in 

PD-1-deficient mice [39]. This seemingly contradictory data, 
however,  could  be  best  interpreted  by  expression  of  addi-
tional costimulatory receptor on T cells other than PD-1.  In 
addition,  it  is  known  that  the  induction  of  type  I  interferon 
(i.e.  IFN-(cid:1)(cid:2)  constitutes  a  primary  signal  for  upregulation  of 
costimulatory molecules induced by LPS and (ds) RNA [40, 
41].  Nevertheless,  we  show  that  the  neutralization  of  IFN-(cid:1) 
did  not  block  the  upregulation  of  B7-H1  and  B7-DC,  sug-
gesting  that  their  expression  on  DCs  may  not  depend,  in 
these experimental conditions, on the induction of IFN-(cid:1).   

TLR  messages  have  been  reported  to  be  present  in  T 
cells.  TLRs  have  been  associated  principally  with  the  T 
helper  cell  response  [42].  For  all  of  these  reasons,  we  first 
addressed  our  attention  on  the  capability  of  TLR-mediated 
signals  to  modulate  the  expression  of  some  B7-famly  mem-
bers at the membrane level of DCs and T lymphocytes. Sub-
sequently,  we  have  analyzed  the  functional  role  of  TLR-
mediated  signals  on  DC  maturation  and  T  cells  activation. 
The induction of the expression of inhibitory receptors, such 
as  CD152  and  PD-1,  may  represent  a  mechanism  able  to 
regulate the intensity of T cell response. What is of interest is 

TLR Modulate Expression of Costimulatory Molecules

the kinetic of expression of these two molecules and of their 
counter-receptors,  showing  the  possibility  to  down-regulate 
the  on-going  of  the  cellular-mediated  immune-response.  In 
fact,  we  observed  an  inhibition  of  T  cells  proliferation  in  a 
two-way MLR when both CDs and T lymphocytes were pre-
activated  via  TLRs.  In  addition,  this  effect  was  partially  ab-
rogated  when  mAb  specific  to  B7-family  members  were 
added to the assay. Thus, we evidenced a possible functional 
role  of  TLRs-stimulation  in  regulating  acquired  immunity 
acting  both  on  DCs  and  T  cells  level.  Finally,  the  using  of 
purified LPS indicates a prevalent role of TLR2 in activating 
T  cells  (obtained  by  non-purified  LPS),  partially  excluding 
the effects mediated by TLR4 [28].  

An interesting observation is due to the effects of flagel-
lin  in  the  modulation  of  costimulatory  molecules,  both  on  T 
lymphocytes  and  DC.  These  results  could  suggest  that  the 
bacterial  protein  flagellin,  the  primary  structural  component 
of  flagella,  plays  a  role  in  mediating  gut  inflammation  asso-
ciated  with  infection  by  enteric  pathogens  and  in  inflamma-
tory  bowel  disease.  Recent  findings  revealed  that  flagellin, 
via  ligation of TLR-5, is a major means of activating the in-
nate  immune  responses  defining  active  intestinal  inflamma-
tion  [43-44].  In  addition,  human  studies  demonstrated  that 
flagellin is also a major antigenic target of immune responses 
associated  with  Crohn’s  disease,  suggesting  that  immune 
responses  to  flagellin  are  not  only  associated  with  Crohn’s 
disease,  but  can  promote  the  pathogenic  response.  Thus,  we 
can hypothesize that the innate immune response to flagellin 
provides a degree of direct protection against flagellated mi-
crobes promoting inflammation and causing perturbations of 
immune cell homeostasis to lead to development of both pro-
tective adaptive immunity and, under select circumstances, a 
pathogenic  disease.  The  ability  to  appropriately  respond  to 
pathogenic  assault  is  critical  to  survival,  and  the  TLRs  are 
the  first  point  of  contact  that  we  have  with  invading  organ-
isms.  

The  mechanisms  regulating  the  TLR  response  must  be 
controlled tightly, first to respond properly to the pathogenic 
challenge  and  second,  to  avoid  excessive  activation  of  the 
TLR  signaling  pathway.  Therefore  control  damaging  injury 
to  the  host  system  following  TLR  activation.  Thus,  a  better 
understanding of the mechanisms behind TLR activation will 
hopefully  lead  to  the  development  of  novel  therapeutic 
strategies in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and auto-
immunity.
