Abstract
Root system architecture (RSA) describes the dynamic spatial configuration of different types and
ages of roots in a plant, which allows adaptation to different environments. Modifications in RSA
enhance agronomic traits in crops and have been implicated in soil organic carbon content. Together,
these fundamental properties of RSA contribute to the net carbon balance and overall sustainability of
biofuels. In this article, we will review recent data supporting carbon sequestration by biofuel crops,
highlight current progress in studying RSA, and discuss future opportunities for optimizing RSA for
biofuel production and soil carbon sequestration.

Introduction and context
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the major anthropogenic
greenhouse gas (GHG) and its atmospheric concentra-
tion has risen by approximately 100 parts per million
since the Industrial Revolution. With current CO2
accumulation rates, global temperatures are predicted
to increase between 1.4°C and 5.8°C by the end of this
century [1]. Fossil fuel consumption releases carbon (C)
from underground stores into the atmosphere and is a
major contributor to the increase of GHG. In contrast,
biofuels can be considered C-neutral or C-negative
because the majority of C emitted from their consump-
tion is fixed from ambient CO2. However, estimates of
GHG balances from biofuel crop production vary from
C-negative to C-positive depending on the assumptions,
components, and boundaries used in the analysis [2].
The uncertainties that contribute to these variable
estimates include GHG emissions from energy inputs
during crop production and biofuel processing as well as
terrestrial C loss due to converting land to agriculture.
Furthermore, biofuel crop cultivation may raise land use
issues, including competition with food production and
destruction of natural habitats [3]. What is clear from
these studies is that
the sustainability of biofuels

depends on the availability of feedstocks that can grow
on low-quality soils like abandoned farmland, are
productive with minimal energy inputs, and can
potentially increase soil organic carbon (SOC) accumu-
lation [4].

Root system architecture (RSA) describes the spatial
configuration of different types and ages of roots in a
plant. RSA is highly plastic and varies with growth
conditions to allow soil exploration for nutrients;
variation in RSA is found between species and between
varieties within a species that are adapted to different
environments [5]. In agricultural crops, RSA has been
shown to enhance yield, drought tolerance, and nutrient
efficiency, which can increase productivity and reduce
input requirements [6-9]. For optimal growth on
marginal
lands, biofuel crop RSA should promote
shallow adventitious roots and dispersed lateral roots
to forage topsoils for diffusion-limited nutrients and
reduce runoff on steep grades as well as deeper roots to
increase water and soluble nutrient uptake [9]. Further-
more, root tissue and exudates contribute to terrestrial C
pools. Increasing root biomass, in particular with deeper
roots, has been predicted to increase C sequestration

because C loss due to microbial decomposition is
concentrated in the upper soil strata [10].

Herbaceous perennial grasses such as switchgrass and
Miscanthus can grow on marginal lands, efficiently fix C,
and reduce net CO2 emissions through C sequestration
in deep roots [11]. Low-input, high-diversity perennial
grasses grown for biofuels have been estimated to
sequester 4.85 tons/hectare per year of CO2, while
current corn grain ethanol and soybean diesel are
C-positive [12,13]. Despite these attributes, perennial
grasses have not been widely adopted commercially
because cellulosic ethanol is not cost-competitive with
fossil fuels in the current market [14,15]. Increasing the
agronomic productivity and environmental benefits of
biofuel crops by modifying RSA can facilitate the entry of
biofuels into the marketplace.

Major recent advances
Changes in soil organic carbon under biofuel crops
A large-scale switchgrass field study recently reported
net energy gains of cellulosic ethanol and increase in
SOC [16,17]. This study was conducted on 10 farms
averaging 6.7 hectares across a 930-km latitude range in
the central and northern Great Plains in the US. SOC
underwent significant increases: 4.0 megagrams of CO2/
hectare per year at a soil depth of 0-30 cm and 10.6
megagrams of CO2/hectare per year at a soil depth of
0-120 cm [17]. Another
recent study re-analyzed
changes in soil organic C under biofuel
feedstock
cultivation across a set of 46 experiments representing
146 site treatment combinations [18]. These experi-
ments tested four types of biofuel
feedstocks (corn
stover, sugarcane, Miscanthus, and switchgrass) and
mixed native prairie grasses. All feedstocks, except corn
stover, were correlated with an increase in SOC.
Notably, Miscanthus and switchgrass were estimated
to increase SOC by 5-25% at a soil depth of 0-60 cm in
5-20 years. Sugarcane plots were found to accumulate
SOC in smaller amounts and at shallower depths than
switchgrass. Mixed native grasses that were not har-
vested for biofuel production were predicted to have the
highest potential to accumulate SOC [18]. The results
were complicated by the effects of site soil character-
istics, management practices, and climate. Nonetheless,
the results were generally consistent with predictions
that SOC would decrease as a result of conversion of
native ecosystems to agricultural use, and that SOC
would accumulate as a result of conversion of farmland
to grassland. [19]. Globally, there are approximately
400 megahectares of abandoned farmland that have not
been converted to other uses [20]. Cultivating perennial
grasses on this land for energy crop production is
projected to sequester up to 1.9 gigatons/year of CO2.

Phenotyping and optimizing root system architecture in
biofuel crops
Functional RSA traits for biofuel feedstocks, including
increased root depth and branching, are proposed to
increase productivity on marginal land and promote
C sequestration [9,10]. These root
traits have been
referred to as traits of the second Green Revolution
because they enhance crop tolerance to drought and low-
nutrient conditions that are prevalent in the developing
world [9]. Unfortunately, owing to high-input condi-
tions used during selection as well as the difficulty of
observing underground tissues, these traits have often
been neglected in traditional programs for breeding.
implementation of noninvasive in vivo root
Recent
imaging systems such as gel-based optical
imaging
[21], X-ray imaging [22], nuclear magnetic resonance
[23], and short-lived radioisotope imaging [24] is
expediting efforts to characterize RSA traits. Further
advances in automating image capture and analysis
methods have been reported in Arabidopsis and rice
[21,25] and will facilitate genome-wide identification of
RSA traits in biofuel crops.

While recent studies support perennial grasses for
efficient soil C sequestration [16-18], they also raise the
issue of a trade-off in C allocations aboveground and
belowground, which contribute to biofuel crop produc-
tivity and SOC accumulation, respectively [18,26]. In
addition, SOC has been correlated with levels of nitrogen
[19,27],
likely in part through modulation of plant
C cycles and RSA. Efforts to optimize RSA for nitrogen
uptake efficiency can potentially increase C sequestration
capabilities. Understanding how plants respond to C and
nitrogen inputs in variable environments and how these
inputs are allocated into shoot biomass aboveground for
harvest and root biomass belowground for C sequestra-
tion are interesting research areas for biofuel crop
improvement.

Genetic control of root system architecture in grasses
Studies on genetic determinants of RSA have been
pursued largely in the model dicot Arabidopsis as well
as in the cereals rice and maize (reviewed in [28-31]). In
Arabidopsis, RSA is defined by iterative development of
lateral roots beginning on the radicle-derived primary
root. Arabidopsis lateral root development, from initia-
tion through patterning events after emergence,
is
coordinated largely by the phytohormones auxin and
cytokinin [29,30,32]. Elongation of primary and lateral
roots is mediated by both cell division and cell expansion
control, including cell wall biosynthesis and modifica-
tion mechanisms [30,33]. Adaptive RSA results from
lateral root development and directional root elongation
responses to environmental signals such as nutrient

levels and mechanical stimuli, which are modulated in
part by phytohormones [34,35]. Rice, maize, and other
monocots generate a more complex fibrous root system
that includes embryonic primary and seminal roots,
postembryonic soil-borne or air-borne adventitious
roots, and lateral roots that arise from all of
the
aforementioned types. Recent cloning of a number of
genes mutated in rice and maize root branching-defective
mutants has identified genes involved in polarized auxin
transport and response and identified cytokinin response
pathways [29,30] and transcription factors, including
auxin-inducible LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY tran-
scription factors in maize [36] and rice [37] and a
cytokinin-regulated WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene
in rice [38]. These findings suggest that conservation in
root branching mechanisms between monocots and
dicots persists despite major differences in RSA and
lend support to comparative genomic approaches.

In perennial grasses, the study of RSA genes is in its
infancy and this is primarily due to their large and
complex genomes. Recently, genome sequencing of the
cultivated grass Sorghum bicolor [39] and the wild grass
Brachypodium dystachion [40] has been completed, and
genome sequencing of proposed biofuel
feedstocks
foxtail millet and switchgrass is under way. Comparative
genomics has identified homologs and regions of
synteny between these grasses [40-43], and these regions
will facilitate identification of orthologous gene sets
involved in RSA in biofuel crops.

A recent major breakthrough in Arabidopsis root
development was the identification of microRNAs
(miRNAs) that regulate lateral root branching and root
patterning [44-46]. Genomic approaches have identified
miRNAs in maize [47-49], rice [50], Brachypodium
[51,52], and switchgrass [53]. Artificial miRNAs have
been used to modulate gene expression in many
experimental systems [54], and understanding miRNAs
in grasses can potentially develop this tool for manip-
ulating RSA in biofuel crops.

Global
transcriptional profiling experiments using
microarrays have identified rice genes responsive to
environmental changes in nitrogen and water stress
conditions [55,56]. A high-resolution transcriptional
map of the rice root and gene expression profiles of
several maize root cell types (wild-type and mutant) that
regulate root branching have been generated by means of
laser capture microdissection [57,58]. Comparison of
these gene expression profiles with high-resolution gene
expression profiles generated from Arabidopsis [59]
implicates sets of common and distinct genetic mechan-
isms in RSA determination.

Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping in rice and maize
is ongoing, and many QTLs controlling root traits in rice
and maize have been identified but none has yet been
cloned [6,28,29]. The gene expression data will also
inform RSA candidate gene prioritization in QTLs in
the future. Genetic tools in biofuel crops, including
germplasms of natural accessions, recombinant- and
near-inbred line populations, mutants, and genetic
and physical maps as well as genetic transformation
methods, are being developed to advance trait identifica-
tion in biofuel crops [60-63].

Future directions
Genetic tools, as mentioned above,
including germ-
plasms of natural accessions and mutants as well as
genetic and physical maps of biofuel crops, are currently
being developed. These tools, coupled with large-scale
phenotyping and genotyping pipelines, will expedite
discovery of RSA traits and genes for breeding and
genetic manipulation to generate improved C-negative
biofuel crops with sustainable biomass production.
