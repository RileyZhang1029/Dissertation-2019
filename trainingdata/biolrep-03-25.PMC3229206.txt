Abstract
life sciences.
Autophagy is one of the newest and fastest emerging research areas in biomedical
Autophagosomes,
large double-membrane vesicles enclosing cytoplasmic components targeted for
degradation, are the hallmark of this catabolic pathway. The origin of the lipid bilayers composing these
transport carriers has been the central enigma of the field since the discovery of autophagy. A series of
recent studies has implicated several cellular organelles as the possible source of the autophagosomal
membranes, if anything further clouding our view. In this compendium, we will discuss these apparently
contradictory results and briefly emphasize the relevance of determining the lipid source used for
autophagy for future translational research, for example in drug discovery programs.

Autophagy as a gatekeeper of cellular functions
The degradation of damaged and excess organelles as well
as the elimination of invading pathogens is essential to
maintain cell homeostasis. Autophagy is the principal
catabolic pathway allowing the cell to survive the stress
of these and other intrinsic and extrinsic insults. Because
of its ability to rapidly eliminate unwanted structures,
this conserved eukaryotic pathway plays a central role in
a multitude of physiological processes including type II
programmed cell death, development, cellular remodel-
ling and differentiation [1-3]. In addition, it plays a
protective role against aging, tumorigenesis, neurodegen-
eration and infections [4-7]. As a consequence of its crucial
role in cell and organism physiology, impaired autophagy
is correlated with various severe pathologies including
cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, neuro- and
myo-degenerative disorders, and malignancies [8-10].

Autophagy in five stages
During autophagy, structures targeted for degradation are
sequestered into large double-membrane vesicles called
autophagosomes. Two characteristics make autophago-
somes a unique type of cellular transport carrier. First, the
cargo is surrounded by two lipid bilayers and second,

these giant vesicles generally have an average diameter of
approximately 700 nm, which can further expand to
accommodate large structures such as cellular organelles
and bacteria [11-13]. Autophagosome biogenesis and con-
sumption can be divided in five discrete steps: induction,
expansion, vesicle completion, fusion and cargo degrada-
tion (Figure 1) [11, 12]. The initial event upon autophagy
induction is the formation of a membranous cistern called
the phagophore or isolation membrane [14-16]. This
compartment appears to be generated from what has been
defined in yeast as the phagophore assembly site or pre-
autophagosomal structure [11, 12, 17-19], a putative early
autophagosomal precursor structure that is formed by
the sequential association of at least a subset of the Atg
(autophagy-related) proteins, proteins specifically
involved in autophagy. The subsequent expansion of the
phagophore through the acquisition of extra lipids permits
the engulfment of the intracellular material targeted for
destruction (Figure 1). The double-membrane vesicle is
completed when the inner and outer bilayer fuse to form
two distinct membranes, one inside the other. Then,
complete autophagosomes first fuse with endosomal struc-
tures to form amphisomes, an event that appears not to
occur in yeast, and then with the mammalian lysosome or

Figure 1. Model for autophagosome biogenesis and cargo degradation

The process of autophagy can be divided in five steps. The induction (1) is elicited by the formation of the phagophore (or isolation membrane), which then
expands (2) around the material targeted for degradation. The omegasome probably represents a phagophore expansion intermediate. The closure of the
growing phagophore (3) leads to the formation of a complete autophagosome. The autophagosome then fuses with endosomal structures to become an
amphisome, an organelle specific to high eukaryotic cells, where the sequestered material starts to be degraded. Subsequently, the amphisome fuses (4) with
lysosomes (vacuoles in plants and yeast) to generate autolysosomes, in the interior of which resident hydrolases break down the internal membrane of
autophagosomes (dashed lines) and the cargo into basic metabolites (5). These metabolites are finally transported in the cytoplasm where they are reused as
either a source of energy or building blocks for new proteins and lipids. Abbreviations: PAS, phagophore assembly site.

the yeast and plant vacuole, allowing the degradation of
the inner vesicle and its cargo by acid hydrolases residing
in these lytic compartments (Figure 1). The basic meta-
bolites generated from this catabolic processing of
biological macromolecules are finally transported in the
cytoplasm, where they are reused as either a source of
energy or as building blocks for new proteins and lipids.
To define the membranes of the autophagy pathway
shown in Figure 1, we propose a working definition based
on which Atg proteins characterize the different inter-
mediate structures of autophagy (Figure 2).

The autophagosomal membranes and their
promiscuous origin
During the last decade, an immense effort has been inves-
ted to try to understand how autophagosomes are formed.
One of the key questions in the field that still lacks a clear
answer is the identity of the source of the membranes
composing these large transport carriers (Figure 3) [20,
21]. One major difficulty has been that phagophores

as well as autophagosomes can be considered unique
organelles because they do not contain any marker
proteins of other subcellular compartments [19, 22-24].
Recently, several groups have approached this question
using cutting-edge microscopy techniques combined with
biochemistry approaches. The results of their work are
controversial because they point to different subcellular
origins of the lipid bilayers composing the phagophores
and/or the autophagosomes.

The endoplasmic reticulum
Originally, the first organelle proposed as the source of
autophagosomal membranes has been the endoplasmic
reticulum, through morphological studies performed in
the 60’s [22, 25]. These observations were subsequently
supported by immuno-ultrastructural observations made
by Bill Dunn in 1990, in which integral membrane proteins
of the rough endoplasmic reticulum were detected in both
the inner and outer membranes of these vesicles [26]. More
recently, using electron tomography, two groups have

A defined order for the Atg (autophagy-related) protein recruitment to the phagophore assembly site has been established in yeast [18] and recent results in
mammalian cells suggest that this hierarchy is conserved [17]. Based on the available experimental data, it is possible to use a few proteins to begin to
molecularly define the various autophagosomal intermediates. The distribution of the following marker proteins is shown: Atg14L is a subunit of the
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase complex involved in autophagy [60]. FIP200 associates with ULK1/2, Atg13, Atg101 into the ULK1/2 complex [61]. DFCP-1
(double FYVE-containing protein 1) could represent the marker protein that allows us to distinguish omegasomes from phagophores [30]. Atg12, Atg5 and
Atg16 form a complex, e.g. Atg12-5-16, which predominantly localizes to the phagophore, but Atg16L may have an even earlier role in autophagy [41].
Lipidated LC3, e.g. LC3-II, and Lamp-1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1) are well-characterized marker proteins of the late compartments of
autophagy. Note that LC3-II is present in the interior of the amphisome/autophagosome and sensitive to lysosomal hydrolyases while Lamp-1 is an integral
membrane protein and resistant to these hydrolyases. Abbreviations: Atg, autophagy-related; DFCP1, double FYVE-containing protein 1; LAMP1, lysosomal-
associated membrane protein 1.

confirmed and emphasised these pioneering observations
by revealing the existence of a physical connection between
the endoplasmic reticulum and the forming autophago-
somes [27, 28]. In the study of Hayashi-Nishino and
co-workers, preparations from cells expressing (or not)
the Atg4BC74A construct, which allows the accumulation
of unsealed autophagosomes [29], were submitted to a
3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. This analysis revealed
that the endoplasmic reticulum and the growing phago-
phore are intimately associated, and form an endoplasmic
reticulum-isolation membrane complex, suggesting that
the nascent autophagosome is a subdomain of the endo-
plasmic reticulum. The most interesting observation was
that the rough endoplasmic reticulum is connected to the
outer as well as the inner membrane of the phagophore
through a single point of contact, supporting the notion
that lipids could be supplied via direct transfer at the sites of
membrane contact. Ylä-Anttila and co-workers obtained
similar findings in a different cell type (Table 1) but they
have reported the existence of several points of contact
between these two organelles [28]. This discrepancy could
be due to either the different experimental systems used or
the fact that the 3D membrane profile models are inter-
preted and hand drawn by a person, and variations can
emerge if the same electron microscopy images are
processed into a tomogram by different people.

Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, a phosphoinositide
essential for autophagosome formation, is enriched in
specific endoplasmic reticulum subdomains under
autophagy-inducing conditions [30]. This finding has
been corroborated by a new report revealing that Atg14L,
a subunit of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase complex
involved in autophagy, is associated with the endoplasmic
reticulum surface [31]. It has also been shown that cup-
shaped structures called omegasomes emerge from these
phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-rich subdomains [30].
The fact that these compartments are positive for com-
ponents of the autophagy machinery, such as Ulk1/Atg1,
Atg14L, Atg16L, LC3/Atg8 and two mammalian homo-
logues of yeast Atg18, WIPI1 and WIPI2, provides evidence
that omegasomes are nascent autophagosomes [17, 30-32].
Double FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1), an endo-
plasmic reticulum resident protein,
is associated with
omegasomes [30] and was found to be present in the
autophagosomal membranes connected to the endoplas-
mic reticulum in one electron tomography study, strength-
ening the functional link between autophagy and the
endoplasmic reticulum [27]. Are, then, phagophores and
omegasomes the same structure? Currently, in the absence
of a detailed molecular and mechanistic characteriza-
tion, the answer to this question is just a matter of opinion
and definition. We favor, however, a model where

Figure 3. Possible sources of the lipids bilayers for the different intermediates of autophagy

The plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria and the Golgi have been proposed to contribute to phagophore biogenesis. In addition,
the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi and mitochondria, could also provide the membranes necessary for the phagophore expansion, while endosomal
compartments are necessary for the maturation of autophagosomes into amphisomes. Abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic reticulum.

omegasomes represent expanding phagophores (Figure 1).
In the absence of ATG5, phagophores can be observed by
electron microscopy [16], but LC3 and DFCP1 are not
recruited to these membrane cisternae [16, 17] suggesting
that these two proteins are required for a step subsequent
to the phagophore formation, very likely its expansion.
As a result, DFCP1 and possibly LC3 could be bona fide
marker proteins to differentiate the omegasome from the
phagophores (Figure 2).

It has also been revealed that Rab1/Ypt1, a small GTPase
mediating membrane transport in the early steps of the
secretory pathway, is also involved in autophagy [33-36].
It remains to be established, however, whether Rab1/Ypt1
is regulating lipid bilayer delivery from the endoplasmic
reticulum to the nascent autophagosomes or is present
on membranes other than that from the endoplasmic
reticulum during autophagy. All together, these data corro-
borate the original idea that autophagosomes emerge
from the endoplasmic reticulum. Importantly, 30% of the

autophagosome precursors observed in the 3D tomo-
graphic studies were not part of
the endoplasmic
reticulum-isolation membrane complex, raising the pos-
sibility that there may be at least one other membrane
source for autophagy [27]. A careful analysis of the
autophagosome membranes not in the endoplasmic
reticulum-isolation membrane complex is required to
determine if, for example, they contain DFCP1. It is
interesting to note that yeast does not possesses a DFCP1
homologue and that, in this organism, autophagosomes
do not appear to form in proximity to the endoplasmic
reticulum vacuole but rather close to the vacuole [37, 38].

Mitochondria
In 2010, the group of Lippincott-Schwartz proposed the
outer membrane of the mitochondria as the main source
of the autophagosomal lipid bilayers [39]. Their findings
were obtained from extensive fluorescent microscopy
analyses in cells stably expressing CFP-LC3 and in most
cases overexpressed mitochondrial outer membrane

probes. Under amino acid starvation conditions (designed
to induce autophagy), these two sets of marker proteins
were found to co-localize on both mitochondria and
autophagosomes suggesting that the membranes of this
carrier and those of mitochondria are linked. The idea that
there is a potential direct physical connection between
these two organelles was reinforced by the visualization of
growing autophagosomes in close proximity to mitochon-
dria using live-cell
imaging technology and electron
microscopy. The model that the authors proposed is that
there is lipid transfer between these two organelles, with
the mitochondria supplying the forming autophagosomes
with newly synthesized phospholipids, in particular the
phosphatidylethanolamine required for LC3 lipidation
[11, 12, 40]. While the co-localization of their mitochon-
drial marker proteins with LC3 indicates that mitochon-
dria are involved in phagophore expansion,
their
experiments have not clarified whether the mitochondrial
lipids are also necessary for generation of the phagophore.
In the same study the authors also showed that the con-
nection between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochon-
dria is crucial because in its absence, starvation-induced
autophagosomes are not formed [39]. This observation
has led them to suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum
contribution and the mitochondria could be equally

important as membrane providers for autophagy. Another
possible interpretation, however, is that disruption of
endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis could affect
the
contribution of mitochondria (or an organelle connec-
ted to it) to phagophore biogenesis and/or expansion.
Recently, it has been shown that Salmonella-containing
autophagosomal structures are positive for DFCP1 and
associated with the endoplasmic reticulum but nega-
tive for the mitochondrial marker protein used by the
Lippincott-Schwartz group suggesting that mitochond-
rial lipids may not be involved in the biogenesis of all
autophagosomes [33].

The plasma membrane
In parallel, the laboratory of David Rubinsztein has
reported that lipids of the plasma membrane directly
contribute to forming autophagosomes [41]. In particular,
their study shows that the clathrin heavy chain, an element
of the endocytic vesicle coat, binds to Atg16L1, a com-
ponent of the Atg autophagy machinery. This association
appears to be crucial for the generation of an early
autophagosomal precursor, possibly a phagophore or an
omegasome, because the formation of autophagosomes
is reduced when the interaction between Atg16L1 and
the clathrin heavy chain is disrupted [41]. Additional

investigations from the same group have emphasized
this initial discovery by revealing that maturation of the
Atg16L1-positive early autophagosomal precursors
requires their homotypic fusion through the action of the
plasma membrane-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-
factor attachment receptor (SNARE) protein VAMP7 and
its interacting partners [42]. The involvement of plasma
membrane SNAREs in the early steps of autophagy has
also been highlighted by work performed in yeast [43].
Additional support for the plasma membrane in autopha-
gosome biogenesis has also indirectly provided through
the discovery that components of the exocyst, a tethering
complex that, in concert with SNAREs, mediates the fusion
of post-Golgi vesicles with the plasma membrane,
associates with nascent autophagosomes and is essential
for nutrient starvation-induced autophagy [44, 45].

The Golgi
These last two studies have also raised the idea of the Golgi
being a potential source for autophagosomal membranes
because the exocyst complex is present at the trans-Golgi
network as well as on post-Golgi vesicles [44, 45]. Also,
the work on yeast revealed that plasma membranes
SNAREs regulate the organization of Atg9-positive tubulo-
vesicular membrane organelles [44], Interestingly, Atg9, a
transmembrane Atg protein essential
for autophagy,
localizes to the trans-Golgi network, post-Golgi and endo-
somal compartments [19, 46, 47] and in yeast plays a
central role in generating the phagophore assembly site
[19]. In the 90’s, the Golgi was implicated in autophago-
some biogenesis because the growing extremities of the
phagophores as well as complete autophagosomes were
decorated with lectins that recognize glycans exclusively
present in post-Golgi membranes [48]. This concept has
recently been reinforced by work in yeast [49], where it has
also been shown that large multi-subunit Golgi tethering
complexes, lobe B of the conserved oligomeric Golgi
complex and subunits of TRAPPIII, a complex homologous
to the TRAPPI and TRAPPII oligomers, are essential for
autophagy [34, 50].

Can all these membrane sources be reconciled
in a single model?
While studies on the membrane origin of autophago-
somes have started to provide some answers about the
molecular mechanism and machinery, they have also
created some confusion regarding the source of the lipids
forming the membrane carriers mediating autophagy.

conditions used to trigger autophagy (Table 1), with cells
able to derive the membranes from the most suitable or
expendable reservoirs.

This hypothesis could explain the reported contradictory
results as different studies used different cell types, organ-
isms and diverse conditions to induce starvation (Table 1).
Thus, in a tissue with a defined function, in response to
a specific stress stimulus, autophagy would be supplied
with membranes from the most optimal reservoir: an orga-
nelle that could guarantee the delivery of a large amount of
lipids, but ideally would not adversely affect the specific
functions of the tissue. From a cursory look at the current
available data, one might conclude that fasting animals
utilize endoplasmic reticulum while nitrogen-starved yeast
use Golgi (Table 1). However, accurate comparative studies
are needed to determine whether, for example, NRK cells
starved of amino acids indeed use the endoplasmic reticu-
lum as the source for autophagosomal membranes [28] and
if they turn to mitochondria when autophagy is induced
by either serum, or serum and amino acid, deprivation [39].
Along the same lines, it would be important to study the
various marker proteins used to implicate the different
organelles in autophagy [26, 39, 41, 42] in parallel in the
same experimental setup.

Another possibility that should not be discarded a priori
is that autophagosomes could be mosaics of membranes
derived from more than one organelle. For example, the
phagophore could originate from one compartment and
the additional lipid bilayers required for its expansion
could be acquired from another source (Figure 3). For
example,
the plasma membrane and Atg9-positive
membranes could contribute to the formation of the
phagophore while the endoplasmic reticulum, mito-
chondria and/or Golgi might be necessary for its
expansion. In this regard, it is important to note that
the endosomal system provides the membranes required
for the last steps of autophagy, i.e. amphisome and
autolysosome formation (Figure 3) [51]. The advantage
to the cell of having a spectrum of membrane sources to
choose from is the availability of a large supply of lipids
to sustain the progression of autophagy; autophago-
somes are huge carriers and a multitude of them are
produced upon induction of this degradative pathway.
One could imagine that a single intracellular organelle
could not provide enough membranes, especially during
prolonged period of starvation or stress.

This apparent discrepancy between the conclusions
reached by the different laboratories could be in part due
to different experimental approaches and techniques used
in the various laboratories. More importantly, the different
contributions could vary depending on the tissues and

Finally, it still remains to be determined whether the
different organelles implicated so far in autophagosome
biogenesis, contribute to non-selective bulk autophagy
or to selective forms of autophagy such as mitophagy
(selective degradation of mitochondria), or pexophagy

the phagophore [26-28] could suggest

(selective degradation of peroxisomes). In this regard,
the observation that the endoplasmic reticulum is found
connected to both the inside and the outside membrane
of
the
endoplasmic reticulum found in the interior of the
closing phagophore is not undergoing the general
process of bulk autophagy but rather is specifically
degraded through a seleletive type of autophagy known
as endoplasmic reticulumphagy or reticulophagy [52,
53]. A similar explanation could be applicable to the
other organelles acting in the phagophore and autopha-
gosome biogenesis.

that

Is this hypothesis,
implicating multiple membrane
sources for autophagosomes, something reconcilable at
the molecular mechanistc level? Potentially yes. Apart
from the transmembrane protein Atg9, the core Atg
machinery is composed of soluble proteins that tran-
siently associate with membranes. Consequently, the cell
could select the membrane source by targeting the signal
and/or the molecule initiating the assembly of the Atg
machinery to the organelle of choice.

Autophagosomal membranes and drug therapies
Experimental evidence indicates that autophagosome
biogenesis is probably a very complex process on
different levels, including its regulation in response to
the different cellular and environmental cues, and in the
choice of membrane sources.

Is there any therapeutic value in determining, or at the very
least understanding, the origin of the autophagosomal
membranes? We believe this discovery will not have a
significant therapeutic value per se but it will be a funda-
mental step forward in the investigation of autophago-
some biogenesis. However, defects in autophagy underlie
various diseases, and the delivery of lipid bilayers from
their source to the site of autophagosome formation is a
highly regulated process that involves several of the pro-
teins that have been shown to be essential for the pro-
gression of autophagy and these could be the target for
drugs modulating autophagy [54]. It is also worth bearing
in mind that the task of assigning a function to a protein is
generally better facilitated when the step of a pathway in
which it participates is defined.

A good example is the transmembrane protein Atg9.
Because of its intrinsic association with lipid bilayers, it has
been postulated that Atg9 could be involved is supplying
constituents of the membranes necessary to the biogenesis
of autophagosomes. This concept is supported by the
finding that a change in Atg9 trafficking is directly asso-
ciated with autophagy induction [19, 47], probably
because of
its key contribution to the phagophore

assembly site/phagophore formation [19]. Not surpris-
ingly, Atg9 transport is controlled by signaling cascades
[55]. While Atg9 itself has not been to date associated to
particular diseases, alterations of factors regulating the
trafficking of this protein such as the phosphatidylinositol-
3-kinase complex involved in autophagy [47, 56] are the
direct cause of tumorigenesis [57, 58]. In this context, the
tumor-suppressor Bif-1 has also been linked to Atg9 [59].
These observations support the possibility that specific
illnesses could be the phenomenological manifestation of
a misregulation of lipid bilayer flux during autophagy. As a
result, the factors modulating these pathways would be the
optimal
targets for drugs aimed to restore normal
membrane supply and consequently proper progression
of autophagy.

Conclusions and future directions
Since the discovery of autophagy, the membrane origin
of the autophagosomes has been the subject of intense
debate in the field. The recent studies employing
advanced technologies have confirmed and extended
the pioneering ultrastructural observations and have
provided some insights on the membrane origin of these
unique carriers. The diverse conclusions of the recent
work, however, have not given an unequivocal answer
yet, but rather they have raised new questions that now
need to be addressed. The work on this phenomenon has
just started.
