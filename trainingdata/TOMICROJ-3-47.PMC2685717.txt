Abstract: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) sense conserved structures of pathogens and influence macrophage functions. Here 
we investigated the  impact of TLR signaling on the modulation of macrophage defense mechanisms against infection of 
Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  (MTB),  the  causative  agent  of  tuberculosis.  We  found  that  a  synthetic  derivative  of  the 
TLR2/6  agonist  MALP-2  and  the  potent  TLR4  agonist  lipopolysaccharide  inhibited  the  intracellular  growth  of  MTB  in 
murine  macrophages.  Likely  the  microbicidal  effect  was  mediated  by  production  of  nitric  oxide  while  it  is  still  unclear  
the  role  played  by  release  of  TNF-(cid:1),  IL-6,  MIP-1(cid:2)  and  IL-10.  These  results  suggest  that  the  activation  of  microbicidal  
defense via TLR ligands is an appealing target for the establishment on immune intervention against tuberculosis.  

Key Words: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toll-like receptor ligands, nitric oxide, cytokines, macrophages, killing mechanisms.  

INTRODUCTION 

  A series of pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like 
receptors  (TLRs)  sense  conserved  structures  of  pathogens 
and  activate  dendritic  cells  (DC)  and  macrophages.  Signals 
via  TLRs  enhance  DC  antigen-presentation  and  favour  the 
development  of  B  and  T  cell  immunity  during  vaccination 
[1],  thus  several  TLR  ligands  are  under  investigation  as 
novel  candidate  vaccine  adjuvant.  On  macrophages,  trigger-
ing  of  TLRs  promote  the  release  of  pro-inflammatory  
cytokines,  chemokines,  nitric  oxide  (NO),  and  prostagland-
ins  [2,  3],  which  in  turn  can  affect  microbicidal  defence 
mechanisms.  The  impact  of  TLR  signalling  on  macrophage 
pathogen  growth  control  is  particularly  relevant  for  those 
intracellular pathogens,  such  as Mycobacterium  tuberculosis 
(MTB),  which  survive  and  grow  primarily  within  host 
macrophages.  MTB  is  the  causative  agent  of  tuberculosis 
(TB),  a  still  dreadful  infectious  disease  which  causes  of  al-
most 2 million deaths per year [4].  MTB or its cell wall  lip-
ids, bind to several TLRs expressed on macrophages. Myco-
bacterial  ligands  for  TLR2  or  the  heterodimers  TLR2/1  and 
TLR2/6 include the mycobacterial p19 lipoprotein arabinose-
capped  Lipoarabinomannan  (LAM),  PIM,  lipomannan  and 
trehalose  dimycolate;  while  for  TLR9  the  CpG-containing 
DNA,  and  for  TLR4,  a  heat-sensitive  but  still  unidentified 
mycobacterial  component  have  been  established  as  ligands 
[5,  6].  Engagement  of  macrophage  TLRs  by  mycobacterial 
ligands promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory media-
tors (IL-12, IL-18, TNF-(cid:1), MCP-1, and MIP1(cid:1)) and antimy-
cobacterial  effectors  (Irgm-1/LRG47,  cathelicidin,  NO  and 
other  reactive  nitrogen  intermediates),  and  also  induces 
phagosome  maturation  [5,  7,  8,  9].  In  addition,  signalling

through MyD88, the adaptor molecule necessary for all TLR 
(apart  from  TLR3),  is  essential  for  protection  against  MTB 
infection in mice [10]. However, MTB has developed several 
immune-evasion  mechanisms  inside  the  macrophage,  often 
through  TLR  ligands,  such  as  the19  kDa  mycobacterial  
lipoprotein,  which  dampen  the  innate  immune  response  
and  allow  MTB  to  survive  also  in  activated  macrophages 
[11-14].  

 
In  this  variegate  context,  we  asked  whether  non-
mycobacterial  TLR  ligands  could  modify  intracellular  MTB 
viability  in  infected  macrophages.  This  should  be  addressed 
to  verify  whether  TLR  ligands  could  be  new  target  for  
TB  drugs  and  to  evaluate  the  risk  of  TLR  ligand-mediated 
adjuvant  use  in  MTB-infected  individuals.  In  the  present 
study  we  investigated  the  effects  resulting  from  TLR2/6  
engagement  by  a  synthetic  derivative  of  the  Mycoplasma-
derived  macrophage-activating 
lipopeptide  of  2 kDa 
(MALP-2)  and  from  TLR4  triggering  by  lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)  on  murine  MTB-infected  macrophages.  MALP-2  
derivatives  are  attractive  candidate  adjuvants  for  both  
mucosal and systemic vaccine formulations [15, 16]. In fact, 
MALP-2  derivatives  induce  secretion  of  pro-inflammatory 
cytokines/chemokines  in  DC  [2,  17],  enhance  the  capacity  
to  process  and  present  antigens  to  T  and  B  cells  [17],  
and 
immunity  against  co-
administered antigens [15, 16]. Among MALP-2 derivatives, 
the  S-[2,3-bispalmitoyloxy-(2R)-propyl]-R-cysteinyl-amido-
monomethoxylpolyethyleneglyvcol, is a safe compound with 
low  toxicity  and  pyrogenicity  when  administered  in  vivo 
[18].  The  S-MALP-2  steroisomer  is  >  100  times  less  active 
than  R-MALP-2  in  stimulating  the  release  of  cytokines, 
chemokines and NO by macrophages [19]. Restricting TLR-
induced  signals  is  very  important  since  a  strong,  protracted 
and non controlled stimulation of TLRs can induce excessive 
inflammation, which  could damage host tissues  and even be 
lethal, as for example in case of septic shock induced by LPS

[18, 20]. Despite its high in vivo toxicity, LPS was used as a 
golden  standard  in  our  studies  since  it  is  one  of  the  most  
potent  inducer  of  macrophage  activation in  vitro.  Moreover, 
LPS  activates  different  pathways  respect  to  those  triggered 
by  MTB  TLR4  ligands  [21]  and  activates  NF-kB  and  
IFN-responsive  genes  through  MyD88-independent  and  -
dependent pathways in macrophages [22]. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Microorganism  

  MTB  H37Rv  (ATCC  27294)  was  grown  at  37°C  in  
Middlebrook  7H9  medium  under  agitation  (120  rpm)  up  to 
mid-exponential  phase.  Aliquoted  stocks  were  stored  at  -
70°C until use; the titers of stocks were verified on a regular 
basis  by  counting  the  numbers  of  CFU  on  Middlebrook 
7H10 agar plates. 

Reagents 

  LPS  from  E.  coli  was  purchased  from  Sigma  Aldrich  
Co,  St  Louis,  MO.  The  MALP-2  derivative  of  3,000  Da,  
S-[2,3-bispalmitoyloxy-(2R)-propyl]-R-cysteinyl-amido 
monomethoxylpolyethyleneglyvcol,  was  synthesized  and 
purified by silica gel chromatography (>95%), as previously 
described  [15].  This  derivative  was  free  from  LPS  contami-
nation. 

Preparation  of  Murine  Bone  Marrow-Derived  
Macrophage  

  Bone  marrow-derived  macrophages  were  prepared  as 
previously described [23]. Briefly, bone marrow was flushed 
from  femurs  of  healthy  C57BL/6  mice  with  Dulbecco’s 
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) and cells were plated at 
2  x  106  in  24-well  plates  in  complete  DMEM  medium 
(cDMEM:  Fetal  Bovine  Serum  10%,  L-glutamine  1%,  (cid:2)-
mercapto-ethanol)  with 
the  addition  of  10%  L-929-
conditioned medium. After 1 day of incubation, the  medium 
was  replaced  with  antibiotic-free  cDMEM  supplemented 
with  10%  L-929-conditioned  medium.  The  cells  were  
incubated  for  an  additional  7  days,  with  medium  replaced 
every 2 days before use in MTB-infection experiments. 

Infection of Macrophages with MTB 

 
Following  the  7-day  culture  period,  the  macrophage  
cultures were infected with MTB, according to the following 
protocol:  bacteria  were  diluted  from  frozen  stocks  in 
cDMEM  and  added  at  a  multiplicity  of  infection  (MOI)  of 
1:1 or 1:0.1 (macrophage  to bacterium ratio) for 2 or 8 days 
of culture, respectively.  MTB was  co-incubated with macro-
phages  at  37°C  in  5%  CO2  for  3  h  and  then  washed  3  to  5 
times  in  DMEM  to  eliminate  extracellular  bacteria.  Follow-
ing  the  last  wash,  cells  were  replaced  in  cDMEM  and  the 
stimuli (LPS and MALP-2) were added and left for the entire 
length  of  the  experiments.  Cells  were  infected  with  the  two 
different MOI of infection in order to obtain after 2 or 8 days 
of  culture  a  significant  percentage  of  infected  cells  without 
evident  sign  of  cell  suffering  (as  checked  by  visualization  
of the macrophage culture by optical microscopy). After 2 or 
8  days  of  incubation  culture  fluids  were  filtered  through 
membranes  (pore  size  0.22  μm,  Millipore,  Malsheim, 
France)  and  then  used  for  cytokine/chemokine  and  nitrite 
detection.  The  bacterial  load  was  evaluated  through  colony

CFU Assay 

  After 8 days of culture, the number of bacteria in macro-
phage  culture  was  enumerated  by  CFU  assay.  Undiluted  or 
diluted in distilled water culture supernatants were plated on 
Middlebrook 7H10 agar  to evaluate the presence of external 
MTB.  The  intracellular  MTB  was  revealed  by  lysing  the 
macrophages  with  distilled  water  containing  0.1%  saponin 
for  3  min,  and  then  plating  10-fold  dilutions  in  distilled  
water  of  the  culture  lysate  on  Middlebrook  7H10  agar.  The 
MTB colonies were counted visually after 21 days of incuba-
tion.  The  value  of  CFU  was  the  sum  of  both  external  and 
intracellular  MTB  CFU.  In  our  macrophage  cultures  more 
than  96%  of  viable  MTB  were  intramacrophagic,  as  calcu-
lated by enumerating MTB in supernatants and lysates. 

Cytokine Detection 

  MTB-infected  macrophage  culture  supernatants  were 
harvested at 2 and 8 days and assayed for IL-6, IL-10, MIP-
1-(cid:2),  MIP-1-(cid:1)  and  TNF-(cid:1)  by  specific  quantitative  sandwich 
ELISA  Kits  (mouse  Quantikine,  R&D  System,  Abingdon, 
UK),  in  accordance  with  the  manufacture’s  instructions. 
Quantification  was  made  against  a  standard  curve  obtained 
for individual cytokine standards provided by manufacturer. 

Nitric Oxide Measurement 

  Culture  supernatants  were  harvest  at  48  h,  and  proteins 
were  removed  by  ultrafiltration  using  10,000  MW  cut-off 
filters  (Millipore).  Nitric  oxide  concentrations  were  deter-
mined  by  colorimetric  detection  of  nitrite  as  an  azo  dye 
product  of  the  Griess  Reaction  using  a  specific  colorimetric 
kit  (ParameterTM  Total  NO/nitrite/nitrate,  R&D  System).  To 
measure  total  nitrite,  an  enzymatic  conversion  of  nitrate  to 
nitrite  by  nitrate  reductase  was  performed,  in  accordance 
with the manufacturer’s instructions.  

Statistical Analysis 

 
Statistical differences were determined by using ANOVA 
and  Bonferroni’s  multiple  t-tests  or  Student’s  t-test.  Linear 
regression  analysis  was  used  to  correlate  amount  of  NO  
produced  and  MTB  growth  inhibition  in  macrophages 
treated with MALP-2 derivative or LPS. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

  The  effect  of  the  TLR2/6  agonist  MALP-2  derivative, 
tested  at  concentrations  ranging  from  5-500  ng/ml  on  the 
intracellular growth of MTB in bone marrow-derived murine 
macrophages.  An  optimal  concentration  of  LPS  (500  ng/ml) 
was also tested in parallel to gain strong macrophage activa-
tion  through  TLR4.  We  found  that  macrophage  treatment 
with  the  lowest  concentrations  of  the  MALP-2  derivative  
(5-50  ng/ml)  and  LPS  significantly  reduced  the  intracellular 
growth  of  MTB  as  compared  to  untreated  MTB-infected 
macrophages  (P<0.01  by  ANOVA-Bonferroni’s  multiple  
t-test  or  Student’s  t-test)  (Fig.  1  A  and  B).  However,  the  
degree  of  microbicidal  effect  induced  by  lower  MALP-2 
derivative  concentrations  was  significantly  different  from

Fig. (1). The  MALP-2 derivative  and LPS reduced intracellular  replication of MTB  in murine macrophages. Bone marrow-derived  macro-
phages infected with MTB (MOI 1:0.1) were stimulated with either LPS or the MALP-2 derivative  at the indicated concentrations. After 8 
days, bacteria in the macrophage cultures were enumerated by CFU assay, as described in Materials and Methods. In panel A, the number of 
CFU is shown as mean ± SEM of triplicate determinations of a single representative experiment out of 4. In panel B, the percentages of MTB 
growth  are  shown  as  the  mean  ±  SEM  of  4  independent  experiments.  Responses  that  were  significantly  different  from  control  untreated

2  derivative  and  P<0.01  LPS  versus  5  ng/ml  MALP-2  
derivative  by  ANOVA-Bonferroni’s  multiple  t-test).  These 
data  clearly  demonstrated  that  the  engagement  of  TLR2/6 
and  TLR4  with  non-mycobacterial  ligands  can  activate  mi-
crobicidal mechanisms in macrophages, suggesting that TLR 

deserve  to  be  investigated  as  new  targets  for  anti-TB  drugs. 
In  addition,  considering  that  TLR2/6  and  TLR4  are  targets 
for many bacterial compounds, our finding suggests that the 
capability  of  macrophages  to  kill  intracellular  MTB  may  be 
modulated by the presence of co-infection or the presence of 
commensal microbial flora in MTB-infected individuals.

  Notably,  the  highest  concentration  of  the  MALP-2  
derivative  (500  ng/ml)  resulted  in  a  poor  control  of  MTB 
replication (Fig. 1 A, B). An ANOVA-Bonferroni’s multiple 
t-test  revealed  a  significant  difference  (P<0.01)  of  MTB 
growth  inhibition  induced  by  lower  MALP-2  derivative  
concentrations  compared  to  the  effect  caused  by  the  highest 
concentration.  In  the  search  of  a  mechanism  to  explain  why 
lower  concentrations  of  MALP-2  derivative  were  more  
effective  in  reducing  MTB  intracellular  growth,  we  meas-
ured the release of NO, the most powerful anti-mycobacterial 
defense  mechanism  in  mice  [25,  26].  In  fact,  a  genetic  dis-
ruption for the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was associated 
with  a  significantly  higher risk  of  dissemination  and  mortal-
ity  in  mice  infected  with  MTB  [27].  We  found  that  the 
MALP-2  derivative,  in  a  concentration  dependent  manner, 
and  LPS,  more  potent,  were  NO  inducers  (Table  1).  This 
suggests  that  the  control  mechanism  for  MTB  intracellular 
growth  may  rely  heavily  upon  NO,  although  this  does  not 
rule  out  the  possibility  of  other  contributing  mechanisms. 
The  microbicidal  power  of  NO  was  however  insufficient  
to  induce  MTB  killing  upon  stimulation  with  the  highest 
concentration  of  the  MALP-2  derivative.  In  fact,  despite  
a  consistent  NO  production,  no  MTB  load  reduction  was 
observed.  In  addition,  the  relatively  weak  NO  induction  
observed  after  treatment  with  the  lowest  concentrations  
of  MALP-2  derivative  was  sufficient  to  achieve  intra-
macrophagic  killing  of  MTB,  in  comparison  with  the  
high  level  of  NO  induction  observed  after  LPS  treatment. 
Thus,  a  linear  regression  analysis  revealed  no  correlation 
(R=0.2)  between  amount  of  NO  produced  and  inhibition  of 
MTB  growth  in  macrophages  treated  with  LPS  or  MALP-2 
derivative.  These  data  indicate  that  after  reaching  a  critical 
threshold  higher  concentrations  of  MALP-2  derivative  or 
LPS  have  no  additional  effect,  rather  they  can  even  antago-

completely  surprising  in  view  of  the  capacity  of  MTB  to

the  NO-mediated  killing  of  MTB.  This 

  On  the  other  hand,  the  release  of  other  mediators  by  
activated  macrophages  may  contribute  to  MTB  survival  
independently  from  a  direct  effect  on  the  NO  pathways. 
Thus,  we  investigated  macrophage  production  of  IL-6,  IL-
10,  TNF-(cid:1)  and  MIP-1(cid:2).  TNF-(cid:1)  is  a  cytokine  critically  im-
portant  for  host  defense  against  MTB  infection  [29],  which 
enhances  release  of  reactive  nitrogen  intermediates  from 
macrophages [30, 31]. However, the production of this cyto-
kine does not always correlate with the extent of growth con-
trol  in  MTB-infected  macrophages  [32,  33].  Infection  with 
virulent  MTB  strains  induced  the  secretion  of  higher  levels 
of  bioactive  TNF-(cid:1)  than  attenuated  strains,  which  in  turn 
correlates  with  their  ability  to  multiply  intracellularly. 
Treatment  of  human  infected  macrophages  with  anti-TNF-(cid:1) 
antibodies  reduces  the  growth  rate  of  intracellular  bacteria, 
whereas  bacterial  replication  is  augmented  by  addition  
of  exogenous  TNF-(cid:1)  [34].  On  the  other  hand,  MIP-1(cid:2)  
was  found  to  suppress  intracellular  MTB  growth  and  its 
diminution  may  promote  intracellular  survival  of  MTB  
in  human  macrophages  [35].  IL-6,  a  cytokine  required  for 
protection against MTB infection [36], can reduce the activa-
tion  of  uninfected  macrophages,  thereby  contributing  to  

Palma et al. 

the  inability  of  the  immune  response  to  eradicate  infection 
[37].  Finally,  IL-10,  an  important  negative  regulator  of  Th1 
immunity  in  tuberculosis  [38],  can  also  inhibit  macrophage 
activation [39]. With this background, we measured the pro-
duction of the above cytokine by MTB-infected cells, treated 
or untreated with the  MALP-2 derivative or LPS. We found 
that  after  2  days  of  culture,  LPS  greatly  induced  production 
of  IL-6,  MIP-1(cid:2)  and  TNF-(cid:1)  in  MTB-infected  macrophages 
(Table 1). Although to  a  lesser  extent  than  that observed for 
LPS,  the  highest  concentrations  of  the  MALP-2  derivative 
enhanced release of these three cytokines, whereas only IL-6 
secretion  was  enhanced  at  low  MALP-2  derivative  concen-
trations  (Table 1).  After  8  days  of  culture,  we  observed  that 
upon  LPS  stimulation,  the  accumulation  of  both  IL-6  
and  TNF-(cid:1)  was  still  greater  compared  to  untreated  MTB-
infected  macrophages,  whereas  MIP-1(cid:2)  accumulation  
was  reduced  (Table  1).  Similar  results,  with  the  exception  
of  almost  undetectable  TNF-(cid:1)  secretion,  were  obtained  at 
the  highest  concentrations  of  the  MALP-2  derivative, 
whereas  the  lower  concentrations  of  MALP-2  reduced  only, 
in  a  concentration  dependent  manner,  the  accumulation  of 
MIP-1(cid:2).  The  accumulation  of  IL-10,  after  2  or  8  days  of 
culture,  was  modified  neither  by  LPS  nor  by  the  MALP-2 
derivative. 

that, 

the  enhancement  of  MTB 

  Although the secretion of these mediators does not allow 
a  clear  elucidation  of  their  correlation  with  MTB  viability, 
we  observed 
intra-
macrophagic  killing  by  the  MALP-2  derivative  is  unrelated 
to  the  production  of  these  selected  cytokines.  In  fact,  the 
MALP-2  derivative  killed  intracellular  MTB  without  the 
need to secrete TNF-(cid:1) and by inducing only very weak IL-6 
secretion.  This  is  an  important  advantage  in  the  context  of 
potential  in  vivo  application,  since  TNF-(cid:1)  is  the  main  re-
sponsible for LPS-mediated lethal toxicity [20] and IL-6 is a 
potent pyrogenic  mediator [40]. Moreover, we can speculate 
that  the enhancement of IL-6 and TNF-(cid:1) secretion observed 
in  MTB-infected  macrophages  upon  stimulation  with  either 
LPS  or  the  highest  concentration  of  MALP-2  may  have  
promoted  mechanisms  favoring  MTB  replication  at  the  
expense of NO-mediated killing.  

 
In conclusion,  the  MALP-2 derivative, at  low concentra-
tions, reduces intracellular growth of  MTB without  the need 
of  releasing  pro-inflammatory  mediators  implicated  in  sys-
temic toxicity. Our data  also  suggest that  it can be proposed 
the safe use of  the  MALP-2 derivative  as  adjuvant  in  MTB-
infected  people,  since  it  has  not  increased  MTB  replication, 
even at  the highest concentrations tested. The opportunity to 
modulate  macrophage  anti-mycobacterial  defense  mecha-
nisms  through  low  toxic  non-mycobacterial  TLR  ligands 
opens  favorable  perspectives  towards  the  development  of 
new  anti-MTB  drugs,  which  are  urgently  needed  for  this 
dreadful disease.
