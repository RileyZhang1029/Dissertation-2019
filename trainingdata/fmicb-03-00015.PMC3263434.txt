It is known that Sphagnum associated methanotrophy (SAM) changes in relation to the
peatland water table (WT) level. After drought, rising WT is able to reactivate SAM. We
aimed to reveal whether this reactivation is due to activation of indigenous methane (CH4)
oxidizing bacteria (MOB) already present in the mosses or to MOB present in water. This
was tested through two approaches: in a transplantation experiment, Sphagna lacking
SAM activity were transplanted into ﬂark water next to Sphagna oxidizing CH4. Already
after 3 days, most of the transplants showed CH4 oxidation activity. Microarray showed
that the MOB community compositions of the transplants and the original active mosses
had become more similar within 28 days thus indicating MOB movement through water
between mosses. Methylocystis-related type II MOB dominated the community. In a
following experiment, SAM inactive mosses were bathed overnight in non-sterile and
sterile-ﬁltered SAM active site ﬂark water. Only mosses bathed with non-sterile ﬂark water
became SAM active, which was also shown by the pmoA copy number increase of over
60 times. Thus, it was evident that MOB present in the water can colonize Sphagnum
mosses. This colonization could act as a resilience mechanism for peatland CH4 dynamics
by allowing the re-emergence of CH4 oxidation activity in Sphagnum.

INTRODUCTION
Peatlands store over one third of global
terrestrial carbon
(Gorham, 1991). Although these ecosystems are carbon dioxide
(CO2) sinks they are also a major source of methane (CH4),
formed as the ﬁnal product of anaerobic degradation of organic
matter. Most carbon in these systems is derived from Sphag-
num mosses (Clymo and Hayward, 1982), the dominant plant in
bog-type northern peatlands. Mosses sequester atmospheric CO2
directly through photosynthesis. Methanotrophic bacteria (MOB)
living inside the moss hyaline cells and on leaf surfaces (Raghoe-
barsing et al., 2005; Kip et al., 2010) also play an important role
in carbon binding. These bacteria provide CO2 for the plant via
CH4 oxidation, a mechanism that is especially important in sub-
merged conditions where CO2 diffusion is slow (Kip et al., 2010).
This phenomenon is of local and global importance as it has been
detected in all 23 Sphagnum species of a peatland area (Larmola
et al. (2010)) and in geographically distant peatlands (Kip et al.,
2010) and may be partly responsible for the lower CH4 emissions
of Sphagnum bogs in relation to other peatland types (Nykänen
et al., 1998).

About 10–15 (Raghoebarsing et al., 2005) or 10–30% (Larmola
et al., 2010) of Sphagnum biomass carbon is from CH4 oxida-
tion by MOB. Thus, it seems clear that mosses beneﬁt from their

partners and the relationship has been discussed to be symbi-
otic (Raghoebarsing et al., 2005). Still, there is evidence that the
bacteria involved are only loosely connected to Sphagnum (Basi-
liko et al., 2004; Larmola et al., 2010). The study by Larmola
et al. (2010) showed that peatland water table (WT) level is the
main factor inﬂuencing MOB activity in mosses. Sphagnum associ-
ated methanotrophy (SAM) became de-/reactivated upon natural
WT ﬂuctuation. However, Larmola et al. (2010) did not provide
evidence whether reactivated CH4 oxidation was caused by reac-
tivation of the original MOB community, invasion of new MOB
from the surrounding water or by both mechanisms. The ability of
MOB to colonize Sphagnum from surrounding water would make
ecosystem CH4 dynamics less vulnerable to extended periods of
drought than a tight symbiosis between MOB and Sphagnum or
relaying on the reactivation of original community. To test the
importance of colonization we examined the question more thor-
oughly. First, we conducted a similar transplantation trial as in
Larmola et al. (2010) where inactive mosses were planted next to
active ones. Colonization process was followed by measurement of
CH4 oxidation potentials and community analysis by a microarray
that proﬁles diversity within the pmoA gene coding for particu-
late methane mono-oxygenase (pMMO), a key enzyme in CH4
oxidation (Bodrossy et al., 2003). By using this method covering

Sphagnum and methanotrophy

a wider range of MOB diversity than Larmola et al. (2010) we
aimed to reveal more detailed changes in community composi-
tions. We hypothesized that colonization of MOB through the
water phase is a substantial reason for methanotrophic reactiva-
tion. Since we presume that all mosses are colonized through the
same pathway this should be reﬂected in MOB of the neighboring
mosses inﬂuencing the microbial community of the transplanted
moss. Second, we tested the hypothesis in the laboratory by treat-
ing inactive Sphagnum mosses with water from a wet depression
(ﬂark) harboring methanotrophic active Sphagnum mosses. As a
control, parallel samples were treated with the same water after
MOB removal through ﬁltration. CH4 oxidation potentials were
measured and MOB communities analyzed by pmoA-based quan-
titative PCR (qPCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) analysis followed by sequencing.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
TRANSPLANTATION EXPERIMENT
Sphagnum transplantation
The experiment was conducted at the Lakkasuo mire (61˚48
N,
24˚19
E; 150 m. a.s.l), a boreal raised bog complex in southern
Finland. On 7 July 2008, patches (8 cm in diameter) of inactive
Sphagnum rubellum from site O were transplanted to six different
ﬂark sites (A–F) showing high Sphagnum associated methan-
otrophic (SAM; CH4 oxidation) activity (Figure 1). To control the
effect of transplantation, S. rubellum was replanted in the original
site and the native Sphagnum species (Table A1 in Appendix) gath-
ered from each of six different ﬂark sites were also returned to their
original places. Thus, all samples were of transplanted Sphagnum.
Moss samples were gathered at the beginning of the experiment
(0 day), after 3 days, and 28 days. After gathering, mosses were
rinsed with deionized water and dried overnight at +4˚C. Only

upper 10 cm of the moss plants were included in the following
analysis. Ecological variables of the transplantation sites are listed
in Table A1 in Appendix.

Methane oxidation potential
Methane oxidation potentials were measured as described in Lar-
mola et al. (2010). Brieﬂy, 30 g of moss was incubated in a 600 mL
ﬂask with an initial CH4 concentration of 10000 ppm in the dark
at +15˚C and the oxidation was monitored after 24 and 48 h by
gas chromatography. Results are presented in micromole CH4 per
gram dry weight per hour (μmol g dw

−1 h

−1).

Analysis of methanotrophic community composition by
pmoA-microarray
Community composition of MOB in Sphagnum samples was
investigated using a microarray (Bodrossy et al., 2003) designed
to detect diversity within the pmoA gene. DNA was isolated as in
Siljanen et al. (2011). A fragment of the pmoA gene was ampliﬁed
using a semi-nested PCR approach with primer pairs A189f/T7–
A682r and A189f/T7–mb661r as in Siljanen et al. (2011) with the
exception that after the ﬁrst PCR-step, products not detectable on
the gel were diluted 1:10 before being used as templates in the sec-
ond PCR. Concentration of PCR products was quantiﬁed using a
Qubit ﬂuorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). In vitro tran-
scription and hybridization was performed as in Stralis-Pavese
et al. (2004) and the applied probe set was similar to that applied
by Abell et al. (2009). One of three parallel original inactive moss
samples from the 0 day time point could be successfully analyzed
(see Larmola et al. (2010) that SAM inactive Sphagnum mosses
host MOB DNA). Probing pmoA diversity cannot detect Methy-
locella or the recently discovered Methyloferula (Vorobev et al.,
2011) methanotrophs as the pMMO enzyme is not present in
these bacteria. It should be noted that another newly discovered
methanotroph group, Verrucomicrobia, is also not detectable by
the probes we used.

Statistical analysis of microarray data
The quantitative nature of the microarray data was converted to
a binary matrix (presence= 1, absence= 0) to reveal the commu-
nity changes caused by different groups of MOB colonizing mosses
after transplantation, and also to prevent false interpretation origi-
nating from non-quantitative nested PCR approach. The data were
then analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) carried
out with CANOCO Version 4.52 (ter Braak and Smilauer, 2002).
Sites A–F (Figure 1) were analyzed separately (n = 1) and as paral-
lel samples (n = 6). Universal MOB probes (positive controls) and
probes not hybridizing to any of the samples were excluded from
the analyses (threshold for positive samples≥3 after normalization
of the data to the scale of 0–100).

potentials at the time of sampling are included (±; values over
0.005 μmol g dry mass−1 h−1 were considered positive). Dominant
Sphagnum species on transplantation sites were S. papillosum (sites A–C),
S. cuspidatum (sites D and E), and S. majus (site F). The original site O and
the transplanted immigrant mosses consisted of S. rubellum.

BATHING EXPERIMENT
Flark water bathing
Sphagnum mosses were gathered from Sallie’s Fen in NH, USA
W 110 m. a.s.l.). Triplicate (n = 3) fresh sam-
(43˚12.5
ples of approximately 30 mL (volume based on the volume of water
replaced by the mosses) of inactive S. magellanicum were subjected
to the following treatments: (I) no treatment; (II) overnight (11 h)

incubation in SAM active S. majus 200 mL ﬂark; (III) overnight
incubation in 200 mL 0.45 μm ﬁltered SAM active S. majus ﬂark
water; (IV) overnight incubation in 200 mL SAM active S. majus
ﬂark water followed by rinsing with deionized water. In the ﬁnal
treatment, S. majus gathered from the active (ﬂark) site was
included as a positive control (n = 3) in the analyses described
below. SAM active ﬂark water was collected directly from a wet
depression next to S. majus vegetation and did not contain any
macroscopic plant material. Each overnight incubation was con-
ducted in the dark at +20˚C. Following treatment, all mosses were
dried overnight at +4˚C. Only upper 10 cm of the moss plants
were included in the following analysis.

Methane oxidation potential and statistical analysis
Methane oxidation potentials were measured as above in the
transplantation experiment but on a Shimadzu 14A gas chromato-
graph equipped with a ﬂame ionization detector (Shimadzu Corp.,
Kyoto, Japan). The results are presented in micromole CH4 per
gram dry weight per hour. The difference between sample treat-
ments was tested using Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric analysis
of variance followed by Nemenyi test for pairwise comparisons
(p < 0.05; Zar, 1999).

Analysis of community composition by DGGE and sequencing
Diversity of MOB in Sphagnum samples from the bathing exper-
iment was explored by pmoA-based PCR–DGGE analysis and
sequencing as previously described (Tuomivirta et al., 2009; Lar-
mola et al., 2010) using the primer pair A189f/GC-621r designed to
target methanotrophs abundant in boreal peatlands (Tuomivirta
et al., 2009). DNA was isolated as above in the transplantation
experiment. Determined pmoA gene sequences were submitted to
Genbank under accession numbers HQ651182 and HQ651183.

Quantiﬁcation of pmoA genes and statistical analysis
Quantitative PCR was carried out as previously described
(Tuomivirta et al., 2009) using the same primer pair as in the
DGGE analysis (A189f/GC-621r). Results are expressed in pmoA
copy number per gram dry weight. To test the difference between
sample treatments, values were ln transformed to normalize the
data followed by ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test (p < 0.05).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the transplantation experiment SAM inactive Sphagnum rubel-
lum mosses were planted on six different SAM active sites. Most

potentials (>0.005 μmol CH4 g
(Figure 1). Comparing transplantation sites individually indicated
that initially different MOB communities became more similar
with time (Figure A1 in Appendix). Averaging over the entire
data set, the pmoA-microarray showed that the MOB commu-
nity of the originally inactive mosses started to resemble that of
the native mosses in the active site after 3 days (Figure 2). After
28 days, MOB communities from the majority of inactive Sphag-
num mosses transplanted to active sites (immigrants in Figure 1)
were more similar to those of native active mosses than to those
in the inactive site at 0 day. Thus, this ﬁeld experiment indicated
that MOB could be transferred between mosses through the water

phase. In addition, the original inactive Sphagnum (site O) became
active after transplantation in its original site and had a differ-
ent MOB community than before transplantation, demonstrating
possible new MOB movement through the water phase (Figures 2
and 3 and Figure A1 in Appendix). However, although SAM activ-
ity was induced in most of the samples together with invasion of
new MOB this was not always the case and SAM activity could also
be induced without major changes in community composition
(Site E, Figure A1 in Appendix). Thus there are methanotrophs
that move through water but we cannot state that for all commu-
nity members. Some members of the methanotroph community
seem to be permanently associated with the mosses regardless of
whether conditions favor CH4 oxidation or not. In our trans-
plantation experiment this factor hindered us from seeing the
invading members of the community and partly explains why large
changes in community composition were not always seen when
CH4 oxidation was reactivated. As Methylocystis-related type II
MOB were present in practically all samples in the transplantation
experiment (Figure 3 and Figure A2 in Appendix), as shown by
the probes Mcy413, Mcy522, Mcy270, Mcy459, Msi232, Peat264,
II509, and II630, their movement between mosses could not be
clearly detected. Still, probes targeting Methylocystis strain M
(McyM309), Methylocystis subgroup B (McyB304), and the genus
Methylosinus (Mst214, Mst314, MsS475, Msi294, NMsiT.271) gave
more variable presence patterns among the type II methan-
otrophs, suggesting water-mediated movement. Compared to α-
proteobacterial type II MOB, the other main methanotrophic

lineage, the γ-proteobacterial type I, was present more rarely and
with more variability. Prior to transplantation, no type I methan-
otrophs were detected in inactive mosses. After 28 day, they were
present in four of six “immigrant” samples transplanted to active
sites. Type Ia subgroup was found only in mosses transplanted in
the active ﬂarks and the native mosses of these sites, suggesting
that this group moved from the native mosses to the transplanted
“immigrants.” Type I MOB could not be clearly linked to the emer-
gence of CH4 oxidation activity, although they were present in
most of the active samples and absent from most of the inac-
tive ones. Consequently, based on the transplantation experiment
alone, we cannot exclusively state that invasion by nearby MOB is
an imperative route in the reactivation of SAM activity.

To examine the hypothesis “the colonization of MOB through
the water phase is a substantial reason for methanotrophic
reactivation” further, a more simpliﬁed experiment was con-
ducted in laboratory conditions. In this bathing experiment,
SAM inactive S. magellanicum mosses exposed to unﬁltered,
SAM active ﬂark water began CH4 oxidation within 11 h, as

icum increased in average by a factor of 63. Also, DGGE revealed
the transfer of two Methylocystis-related methanotrophs through
unﬁltered water (Figure 5). Filtered water did not induce CH4 oxi-
dation activity. This experiment clearly demonstrated the water-
mediated dispersal of MOB, but it also showed that compared to

invasion by new MOB, reactivation of the original MOB was not
a major mechanism in the reactivation of CH4 oxidation process
in the studied mosses. In the DGGE gel the two Methylocystis
bands are faintly present already in the unbathed negative con-
trol. Bathing of the mosses with sterile-ﬁltered water caused these
bands to fade away as shown also by the qPCR. On the contrary,
treatment with unﬁltered water caused emergence of high num-
bers of MOB and also high SAM activity. Thus the reactivation of
the CH4 oxidation activity must have been brought up by MOB
invading the moss through the water phase or the growth in MOB
numbers should have been seen also in the moss bathed with
ﬁltered water. Moreover, known Methylocystis strains have dou-
bling times of several hours when growing on CH4 in laboratory

conditions (Wise et al., 1999; Dedysh et al., 2007; Baani and Liesack,
2008) suggesting that it would be highly unlikely for these MOB
to increase their numbers over 60 times higher in 11 h, as seen in
the bathing experiment. Therefore we accept the posed hypothesis
with a minor modiﬁcation: MOB colonization through the water
phase occurs and it obviously supports the reactivation of CH4
oxidation in Sphagnum mosses, but our experiments cannot rule
out the possibility of reactivation of original community members.
This could be investigated in a prolonged bathing experiment in
combination with diurnal light rhythm, but was beyond the scope
of this investigation.

Based on our results that MOB colonize the mosses from water,
the relationship between MOB and Sphagnum seems to be a loose,
mutually beneﬁcial association rather than a tight symbiosis. This
result is in line with a recent ﬁnding by Bragina et al. (in press)
who showed by pyrosequencing that some bacteria are passed
from the Sphagnum sporophyte to the gametophyte but no known
methanotrophs were among them. Representatives of the genus
Methylocystis, however, were detected in the gametophyte. Still,
even though methanotrophs may not be obligately dependent
on the mosses, they most likely prefer the plant cells over life
in the water phase. This is supported by our results from the
bathing experiment. Despite having slightly lowered the amount
of pmoA detected, mosses rinsed with sterile water had almost the
same potential CH4 oxidation activity as unrinsed ones, indicat-
ing that loosely attached methanotrophs play only a minor role
in the process. In addition, the rapid (<11 h) increase in pmoA
copy number suggests that methanotrophs present in the water
phase quickly colonize Sphagnum. Compared to free-living bac-
teria, those associated with plants may gain an advantage from
a stable CH4 gradient and supply of oxygen from photosynthe-
sis, but it has yet to be demonstrated. In the bathing experiment
methanotrophs moved to the mosses even in the dark when oxygen
was not formed in photosynthesis, indicating that at the very least
oxygen is not the only advantage bacteria gain from the mosses.
In another study no CH4 oxidation activity was detected in peat
water surrounding Sphagnum mosses (Kip et al., 2010), also indi-
cating that, although present, MOB are not actively oxidizing CH4
in the water phase. Since the only MOB, Methylocystis, detected in
the bathing experiment, is non-motile (Dedysh, 2009), it remains
open how these MOB cells end up on the moss surface and inside
the hyaline cells. On the other hand another peatland inhabiting
type II MOB genus, Methylosinus (Dedysh et al., 2003; Chen et al.,

(GQ121280).

2008), does contain motile species (Bowman et al., 1993) and has
been isolated from Sphagnum mosses (Kip et al., 2011a).

Similar to previous studies (Tuomivirta et al., 2009; Larmola
et al., 2010; Yrjälä et al., 2011) of Finnish peatlands, DGGE of
our bathing experiment samples from Sallie’s Fen, located in NH,
USA, detected only Methylocystis-like MOB. These were also the
dominant methanotrophs in our transplantation experiment, run
on the Finnish Lakkasuo raised bog complex, when the pmoA-
microarray was used. Dominance of type II MOB in our samples
is in line with previous studies. Especially the high prevalence of
Methylocystis in Sphagnum samples is not surprising as it is com-
monly found in northern peatlands (McDonald et al., 1996; Morris
et al., 2002; Jaatinen et al., 2005; Dedysh et al., 2006; Chen et al.,
2008). Although Kip et al. (2010) found, in contrast to our results,
a high diversity of type I methanotrophs, Methylocystis was still
the dominant species in their globally gathered Sphagnum sam-
ples (Kip et al., 2010) and also very abundant in mosses from a
Dutch peat bog (Kip et al., 2011b).

We have demonstrated that water serves as an essential route for
methanotroph dispersal and is thus an imperative part of Sphag-
num–methanotroph association. This is likely to act as a backup
mechanism for peatland CH4 dynamics. Drainage of peatlands can
alter the methanotroph community composition (Jaatinen et al.,
2005; Yrjälä et al., 2011) and reduce Sphagnum coverage (Yrjälä
et al., 2011), consequently compromising this mutualistic associ-
ation. A case study (Yrjälä et al., 2011) found that the particular
Methylocystis sp., which was found now also in the mosses of Sal-
lie’s Fen (northeastern USA) of our bathing experiment and in the
mosses of Lakkasuo (Larmola et al. (2010)), was lost when the WT
dropped by 14 cm, which is similar to the predicted drawdown
for northern peatlands in the global warming scenario by 3˚C

(Roulet et al., 1992). Restoration of drained peatlands aims to
reactivate ecosystem function and restart methanogenesis (Tuit-
tila et al., 2000). Any peatland restoration program should also
aim to re-establish the conditions for the mutualistic association
between methanotrophs and Sphagnum. Our study indicates that
this could be done via transplantations of Sphagnum from donor
sites with undisturbed CH4 dynamics. In natural environments
Sphagnum associated methanotrophic communities may reduce
the methane ﬂux by as much as 80% (Kip et al., 2010). It is not
yet known whether this phenomenon can reach that scale also in
compromised ecosystems.

CONCLUSION
Here we showed, by two complementing experiments, that inva-
sion of new MOB through water occurs and that it can be an
important mechanism in the reactivation of CH4 oxidation in
Sphagnum mosses. Based on this result, the relationship between
Sphagnum and methanotrophs is a loose, mutually beneﬁcial asso-
ciation, although some methanotrophs may have an even tighter
connection to the mosses.

the binary microarray data divided into transplantation sites
(A–F) (original 0 day= original inactive moss, original
28 days= original moss transplanted back to the original site,

immigrant= original moss transplanted to the active ﬂark site,
native= native moss of the active ﬂark site). The ﬁrst and second
PCA axes explain 25 and 11% of the compositional variation,

FIGURE A2 | Heatmap of semiquantitative microarray results. Each site
(A–F and O) is showed separately together with the original 0 day sample data
for comparison. Microarray analysis was successful for only one of three
parallel inactive original_0 day samples. Samples that were inactive in CH4

oxidation at the time of sampling are marked with a black dot (•). A value of
100 (see color code bar) indicates maximum signal for an individual probe and
zero represents no hybridization. Only probes with a positive hybridization
signal on any of the samples are shown.
