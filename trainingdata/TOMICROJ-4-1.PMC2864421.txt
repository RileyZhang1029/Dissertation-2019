Abstract:  Objective:  Human  tuberculosis  (TB)  has  re-emerged  at  an  alarming  rate  as  one  of  the  deadliest  contagious  
diseases;  not  only  in  the  developing  world,  but  also  in  the  developed  countries.  Its  re-emergence  indicates  failure  to  
control its transmission. What causes part of the alarm is the growing number of isolates displaying resistance to the first 
line drugs used in its control. The very high volume of travel to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is yet another reason for 
concern over the spread of the disease. This study reports on the pattern of multiple drug (MDR) resistance exhibited by 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates from a major hospital in the UAE. 
Methods:  All  pulmonary  and  extrapulmonary  tuberculosis  patients  with  positive  culture  results  from  January  2001  to  
December 2008 were included in the study. Cultures were performed at the mycobacteriology laboratory of the Emirati 
Hospital, Abu Dhabi, UAE, using the conventional Lewes-Johnson media. M. tuberculosis was isolated by standard pro-
cedures. M. tuberculosis complex was identified by conventional biochemical tests. Anti-mycobacterial sensitivity testing 
was done by the disk method as described by Wayne & Krasnow. 
Results: From 2002 to 2008, 43 nonrepetitive culture-positive cases were identified. The resistance rates of M. tuberculo-
sis  to  tested  first-line  agents  were  as  follows:  isoniazid,  34.5%;  pyrazinamide,  34.8%;  rifampin,  32.5%;  streptomycin, 
25.6%;  and  ethambutol,  20.9%.  The  resistance  rate  to  isoniazid,  rifampin  and  pyrazinamide  was  7%;  to  isoniazid,  
rifampin and streptomycin was 2.3%; and to isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin and pyrazinamide was 2.3%. The resistance 
rate to all the five agents together was 4.6%. 
Conclusion:  This  study  is  the  first  in  the  UAE  to  report  such  high  levels  of  resistance  to  anti-TB  drugs;  27.7%  for  
anti-tuberculosis  Drugs  such  as  isoniazid  and  pyrazinamide  are  of  great  significance  to  achieve  proper  treatment  in  
M. tuberculosis infections in future. Indeed, isoniazid and rifampicin are important components of any regimen for the 
treatment of drug susceptible TB.

INTRODUCTION 
  Human  tuberculosis  (TB)  continues  to  be  the  deadliest 
contagious infectious disease. It is estimated that one third of 
the world population is infected with the aerobic pathogenic 
bacterium,  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis,  which  usually  es-
tablishes its infection in the lungs. TB is transmitted mainly 
by inhalation of infectious droplets produced during cough-
ing, sneezing, laughing or shouting, by persons with pulmo-
nary  or  laryngeal  disease.  The  TB  bacilli  invade  the  body 
through mucous membrane and/or damaged skin [1].  
  The  impact  of  tuberculosis  (TB)  on  global  health  has 
grasped  the  international  attention  after  the  increase  in  the 
number  of  cases  worldwide,  including  the  developed  coun-
tries [2]. There are approximately 10 million new cases and 
three  million  deaths  annually  throughout  the  world.  More 
than  90%  of  the  cases  occur  in  developing  countries.  In 
1993, TB was declared by the WHO as a global public health 
emergency [1].

  The  number  of  cases  of  tuberculosis  showed  an  initial 
decline in the United States from 84,304 in 1953 to 22,201 in 
1985.  The  number  of  reported  cases  of  tuberculosis  in  the 
United States increased in 1992 by 18% [3]. The reversal of 
the  downward  trend  was  due  to  multiple  factors,  including 
the AIDS epidemic and the emergence of drug resistance. 
  Treatment consists of a combination from the six essen-
tial  anti-TB  drugs,  namely;  isoniazid,  rifampicin,  pyrazina-
mide, streptomycin, ethambutol and thioacetazone. Strains of 
M.  tuberculosis  resistant  to  chemotherapeutic  agents  have 
been recovered with increasing frequency [2]. 
  Control  measures  and program implementation had sev-
eral  obstacles  that  limited  their  targeted  achievements  [4]. 
Complicating  the  matters  more,  the  resurgence  of  TB  in 
many areas was also associated with increasing rates of drug 
resistant  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  (M.  tuberculosis). 
Multidrug-resistant  tuberculosis  (MDR-TB)  is  associated 
with  higher  rates  of  failure  and  death  than  in  drug-
susceptible TB [3] and it is  more difficult and expensive to 
treat  [2].  A  survey  on  global  anti-TB  drug  resistance  was 
conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the 
International  Union  against  Tuberculosis  and  Lung  Disease 
2010 Bentham Open 

2    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2010, Volume 4 

(IUATLD);  the  released  report  indicated  that  the  data  
obtained represent all geographical areas of the world except 
the Eastern Mediterranean Region [5]. United Arab emirates 
(UAE) is one of the countries in this region. It receives mil-
lions of visitors a year for commerce and work purposes. No 
information was reported on the pattern of MDR resistance. 
Thus, we undertook this study to evaluate the prevalence and 
trends of resistance of M. tuberculosis in a major hospital in 
the United Arab Emirates. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
  All pulmonary  and extrapulmonary tuberculosis patients 
with positive culture results from January 2001 to December 
2008 were included  in the study.  The  medical records were 
reviewed for the age, sex, nationality, and the site of the cul-
ture. Cultures were performed at the mycobacteriology labo-
ratory  of the  Emirati  Hospital,  Abu  Dhabi,  UAE,  using  the 
conventional Lowwenstein-Johnson media [6]. M. tuberculo-
sis was isolated by standard procedures [6]. M. tuberculosis 
complex  was  identified  by  conventional  biochemical  tests. 
Anti-mycobacterial  sensitivity  testing  was  done  by  the  disk 
method  as  described  by  Wayne  &  Krasnow  [7].  Although 
this is a retrospective study, quality control was usually per-
formed during susceptibility testing using the reference strain 
provided  by  the  College  of  American  Pathologists.  The  
concentrations of the drugs used were as follows: isoniazid,  
1  µg/mL  and  5  µg/mL;  rifampin,  5  µg/mL;  streptomycin,  
10  µg/mL;  and  ethambutol,  25  µg/mL.  The  tested  isolate  
was considered resistant if the proportion of the tested isolate 
was > 1% of the control population. Drug-resistant tubercu-
losis  was  calculated  for  single  first-line  agents.  Multidrug-

Alfaresi and Hag-Ali 
resistant  M.  tuberculosis  (MDR-TB)  was  defined  as  resis-
tance to two or more first-line drugs.  

RESULT 
 
From 2002 to 2008, a total of 37 distinct positive culture 
findings  for  M.  tuberculosis  were  identified.  The  annual  
incidence rates per 100,000 outpatient population are shown 
in  Fig.  (1)  and  Table  1.  The  incidence  in  2002  was  0.64/ 
100,000,  increased  to  1.22/100,000  in  2004  and  reached 
1.29/100,000  in  2008.  An  increasing  trend  in  incidence  
rates  of  culture-positive  tuberculosis  was  observed  during 
the  study  period.  This  was  not  stastistically  significant 
(P=0.064). 
  Of the total patients, there were 33 Emirati (76.7%), and 
the remaining 10 patients (23.3%) were non-Emirati. Of the 
total patients, 34 were male (79%) and 9 were female (21%). 
The  isolates  were  obtained  from  pulmonary  specimens  (n= 
30, 69.7%) and the extrapulmonary sites (n= 13, 30.3%). The 
majority  of  the  extrapulmoary  isolates  were  obtained  from 
abscesses. 

Resistance to Single Antituberculsis Medication 
  The  resistance  rate  of  M.  tuberculosis  to  any  single  
drug  was  23%  (n=10)  (Table  1).  The  resistance  rate  of  M. 
tuberculosis  to  the  tested  first-line  agents  were  as  follows: 
Isoniazid,  34.8%;  ethambutol,  20.9%  (n=9);  streptomycin, 
25.6  (n=11);  rifampin,  32.5%  (n=14);  and  pyrazinamide, 
34.8% (n=15). The rates are shown in Table 2. There was no  
statistical difference in the rate of resistance between Emirati 
and  non-Emirati  patients.  In  addition,  there  was  no  differ-

MDR-TB 
  MDR-TB was defined as resistance to two or more first-
line agents. The rates of MDR-TB are shown in Table 3. The 
resistance  rate  for  any  combination  of  MDR  was  16.2% 
(n=7). The resistance rate to isoniazid , rifampin and pyrazi-
namide was 7%(n=3), to isoniazid , rifampin and streptomy-
cin was 2.3%(n=1), and to isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin 
and pyrazinamide was 2.3%(n=1). The resistance rate to all 
the five agents together was 4.6%(n=2). 
DISCUSSION 
  Tuberculosis continues to be a major concern for health-
care workers throughout the world. The numbers of tubercu-

losis  cases  have  declined  steadily  in  western  and  central 
Europe, North and South America, and the Middle East, and 
have increased in countries of the former Soviet Union and 
in sub-Saharan Africa [8]. In the United States, there were a 
total  of  14,871  tuberculosis  cases  (5.1/100,000  population) 
during  2003,  representing  a  1.9%  decline  in  the  rate  from 
2002 [9]; however, tuberculosis rates have increased in cer-
tain states in the United States [9].  
  The  incidence  of  smear-positive  tuberculosis  in  Saudi 
Arabia was estimated to be 20 per 100,000 populations [10]. 
The  incidence of smear-positive tuberculosis in  The United 
Arab  emirates  was  estimated  to  be  20  per  100,000  popula-
tions [10]. The incidence rates of culture-positive tuberculo-
sis in our study per 100,000 populations were 0.64 in 2002, 
1.22 in 2004, and 1.29 in 2008. Thus, the incidence of tuber-
culosis in the current study showed an increasing linear trend 
over the study period from 2002 to 2008; however it was not 
statistically significant (p=0.064).  
  The  prevalence  of  drug  resistance  of  tuberculosis  varies 
from one part of the world to another. In the United States, 
drug-resistant  tuberculosis  was  detected  in  14.2%  in  1991 
[10]  and  10%  in  1997  [11].  In  the  United  States,  isoniazid 
resistance was the most prevalent and accounted for 8% [12]. 
Isoniazid resistance has ranged from 0%  in New  Caledonia 
to  7.9%  in  Mozambique  [12],  and  is  10%  in  India  [13].  In 
Saudi  Arabia,  isoniazed  resistance  was  the  most  prevalent 
and  it  varied  from  one  part  of  the  country  to  another.  The 
highest rate (41%) was observed in Gizan [14-16]. 
 
In  the  current  study,  isoniazid  and  pyrazinamide  resis-
tance was 34.7% each. The second most common resistance 
pattern  in  our  study  was  found  in  rifampin  (32.5).  A  high 
rate  of  rifampin  resistance  was  reported  from  Riyadh- 
KSA  (9%)  [17,  18].  In  other  parts  of  the  world,  the  preva-
lence  of  rifampin  resistance  was  0%  in  New  Zealand  and 
New  Caledonia,  1.7%  in  the  United  States,  and  1.8%  in  
Mozambique [12]. 
In our study, the rate of resistance of M. tuberculosis to 
 
streptomycin was 25.6%. Similarly, in a study from Jeddah-
KSA,  streptomycin  resistance  was  22.7%  [16].  The  rates 
were 14.5% in Sierra Leone and 6.6% in India.  
  The  resistance  rate  to  ethambutol  was  20.9%  in  our 
study. This is much higher than other reports worldwide. A 
high rate of ethambutol resistance was observed  in Uganda 
(2.4%) and Thailand (3%). In a study from India, the rate of 
ethambutol resistance was 6.6%. 
  The rate of MDR-TB in our study was high. The highest 
rate  of  resistance  was  to  isoniazid,  rifampin  and  pyrazina-
mide (7%). The prevalence of MDR-TB among new cases of

tuberculosis was 44% Gizan-KSA, 14% in Estonia, 10.8% in 
Henan  Province  in  China,  9%  in  Latvia,  9%  in  Ivanovo 
Province in Russia, 5% in Iran, and 4.5% in Zhejiang Prov-
ince in China [11]. 
  The  importance of knowing susceptibility results for M. 
tuberculosis  became  more  significant  especially  in  our  re-
gion of the world, because of the increase in resistance rates, 
high travel activity of hosts and the limited available agents. 
Appreciating the importance of documenting the susceptibil-
ity findings of M. tuberculosis, the WHO has inaugurated a 
worldwide program for surveillance [6]. 
  Multi-drug-resistant  M.  tuberculosis  (MDR-TB)  as  de-
fined  by  Centers  for  Diseases  Control  and  Prevention,  the 
World  Health  Organization,  and  the  International  Union 
against  Tuberculosis  and  Lung  Disease  is  resistance  to  at 
least  isoniazid  and  rifampin  with  or  without  resistance  to 
other agents [9-10]. First-line agents are isoniazid, rifampin, 
streptomycin,  ethambutol,  and  pyrazinamide.  We  have 
adopted 
recommended  by  WHO  and 
IUATLD for anti-TB drug resistance surveillance [11].  
  We are well aware of the limitations of meta-analysis as 
an  evidence-based  approach  in  the  field  of  infectious  dis-
eases [12]. It was indicated that there was only one report on  
M.  tuberculosis  susceptibility  from  Saudi  Arabia  [13].  In 
fact,  Al-Jama  et  al.  [19]  also  reported  on  the  susceptibility  
of  isolates  of  M.  tuberculosis  from  the  Eastern  province  in 
1999. 
  This study is the first in the UAE to report such high lev-
els of resistance to anti TB drugs; 21% for Anti tuberculosis 
Drugs  such  as  isoniazid  and  pyrazinamide  are  of  great  
significance  to  achieve  proper  treatment  in  M.  tuberculosis 
infections  in  future.  Indeed,  isoniazid  and  rifampicin  are  
important  components  of  any  regimen  for  the  treatment  of 
drug  susceptible  TB.  Resistance  to  those  two  agents,  by 
definition,  indicates  MDR-TB  [20].  This  definition  marks 
the  threshold  for  grave  consequences  of  resistance  to  those 
agents in TB treatment [21]. 
 
In conclusion, in this study we examined the pattern and 
incidence  of  resistance  of  tuberculosis  to  first-line  agents 
over time. The resistance rate to isoniazid and pyrazinamide 
showed a significant decline over the study period, whereas 
the  resistance  rate  of  ethambutol  remained  low  and  stable. 
Further  studies  and  continued  surveillance  of  the  resistance 
pattern of M. tuberculosis is needed to further delineate the 
risk  factors  and  to  formulate  the  plans  for  the  future  man-
agement of tuberculosis.
