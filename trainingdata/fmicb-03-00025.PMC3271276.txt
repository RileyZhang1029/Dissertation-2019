High-pressure is a key feature of deep subsurface environments. High partial pressure of
dissolved gasses plays an important role in microbial metabolism, because thermodynamic
feasibility of many reactions depends on the concentration of reactants. For gases, this is
controlled by their partial pressure, which can exceed 1 MPa at in situ conditions.Therefore,
high hydrostatic pressure alone is not sufﬁcient to recreate true deep subsurface in situ
conditions, but the partial pressure of dissolved gasses has to be controlled as well. We
developed an incubation system that allows for incubations at hydrostatic pressure up to
60 MPa, temperatures up to 120˚C, and at high gas partial pressure. The composition and
partial pressure of gasses can be manipulated during the experiment. To keep costs low,
the system is mainly made from off-the-shelf components with only very few custom-
made parts. A ﬂexible and inert PVDF (polyvinylidene ﬂuoride) incubator sleeve, which is
almost impermeable for gases, holds the sample and separates it from the pressure ﬂuid.
The ﬂexibility of the incubator sleeve allows for sub-sampling of the medium without loss
of pressure. Experiments can be run in both static and ﬂow-through mode. The incuba-
tion system described here is usable for versatile purposes, not only the incubation of
microorganisms and determination of growth rates, but also for chemical degradation or
extraction experiments under high gas saturation, e.g., ﬂuid–gas–rock-interactions in rela-
tion to carbon dioxide sequestration. As an application of the system we extracted organic
compounds from sub-bituminous coal using H2O as well as a H2O–CO2 mixture at elevated
temperature (90˚C) and pressure (5 MPa). Subsamples were taken at different time points
during the incubation and analyzed by ion chromatography. Furthermore we demonstrated
the applicability of the system for studies of microbial activity, using samples from the Isis
mud volcano. We could detect an increase in sulfate reduction rate upon the addition of
methane to the sample.

INTRODUCTION
The incubation of deep subsurface microorganisms under high-
pressure conditions is necessary because under non-in situ con-
ditions (especially low pressure) metabolic processes and survival
of microorganisms adapted to high hydrostatic pressure are nega-
tively impacted (Yayanos and Dietz, 1983; Fang et al., 2010). Since
the ﬁrst isolation of a pressure-adapted bacterium by Yayanos
et al. (1979) numerous studies on the effect of elevated pressure
on genetic, metabolic, and physiological aspects of microorgan-
isms were carried out. Multiple biological effects of pressure on
organisms were observed: shifts in metabolic activity (Abe et al.,
1999; Bothun et al., 2004), transcription proﬁles (e.g., Boon-
yaratanakornkit et al., 2007), and the dissociation of ribosomes
(e.g., Schulz et al., 1976), changes in growth rates (Yayanos, 1986;
Boonyaratanakornkit et al., 2006; Takai et al., 2009), gene reg-
ulation (Bartlett et al., 1989), stabilization of proteins (Hei and
Clark, 1994; Sun and Clark, 2001), and the composition of mem-
brane lipids (Delong and Yayanos, 1985; Kaneshiro and Clark,
1995). For reviews of pressure effects on biological processes see
Jaenicke (1983) and Bartlett (2002). Biochemical processes are also
inﬂuenced by physical implications of high hydrostatic pressure,

because the thermal expansion coefﬁcient (Frank, 1970) as well as
viscosity and ﬂuidity of water (Horne and Courant, 1965) affect
chemical reactions and cellular processes.

The idea of constructing and using a high-pressure vessel for
studying deep-sea life is quite old. Zobell and Oppenheimer (1950)
described a simple pressure vessel for the application of high
hydrostatic pressure on microorganisms. Pressure was applied to a
culture tube with a neoprene stopper working as piston for trans-
mitting pressure to the sample. This type of pressure application
is still being used today (Orcutt et al., 2008). Yayanos (1969) and
later Taylor and Jannasch (1976) presented techniques for sub-
sampling of media and bacteria and the determination of reaction
rates without decompression, thereby eliminating the repetitive
and time-consuming decompression. The use of glass syringes or
a ﬂexible Teﬂon container instead of a sealed culture tube (Schmid
et al., 1978) had the beneﬁt of an inert reaction chamber. How-
ever, the leakage of gases from the media into the pressure liquid or
vice versa required a gas-tight incubation chamber. Bernhardt et al.
(1987) used ﬂexible nickel tubes for incubations of methanogenic
microorganisms with hydrogen. Also ﬂexible cells made of gold
(Seyfried, 1979) or titanium (Seyfried and Janecky, 1985) were

used as high-pressure reaction chamber. However, such devices
were designed for studies of hydrothermal alteration of basalt and
therefore made for much higher temperatures than what is nec-
essary for biological incubations. All described techniques are still
in use. Recently Parkes et al. (2009) presented a high-pressure sys-
tem that can accept drill cores, taken with a high-pressure corer
without decompression. The system also allows for sub-sampling
without decompression.

Temperature also has an effect on growth rates and other phys-
iological characteristics of all microorganisms. Thermophilic and
thermotolerant microorganisms can be found at hydrothermal
vents, terrestrial hot springs, and intraterrestrial habitats (Peder-
sen, 2000) like salt mines (Vreeland et al., 1998), groundwater deep
within Earth (Lin et al., 2006; Chivian et al., 2008), or oil reservoirs
(e.g., L’Haridon et al., 1995).

Several techniques for the incubation of these thermophilic
microorganisms are used: thermistors (e.g., Bernhardt et al., 1987),
drying ovens (Miller et al., 1988; Takai et al., 2008), and water baths
(e.g., Jannasch et al., 1996). Incubators and water baths became the
most commonly used techniques for keeping pressure vessels at the
desired temperature.

The application of elevated gas concentration in high-pressure
incubations started about 25 years ago. Gases were applied to
high-pressure vessels to maintain anaerobic conditions in incu-
bations of hyperthermophilic archaea (e.g., Raven et al., 1992), to
obtain higher cell densities during incubation (e.g., Mukhopad-
hyay et al., 1999) or as substrate for methanogenic microorganisms
(Bernhardt et al., 1987; Takai et al., 2008). Nauhaus et al. (2002)
incubated sediment samples from a methane hydrate ﬁeld at differ-
ent partial pressures of methane and showed a strong correlation
between microbial activity and methane partial pressure. None

of these incubation systems allowed manipulation of the gas
partial pressure during the incubation or sub-sampling without
decompression.

Here, we present

an inexpensive high-pressure high-
temperature incubation system that allows the incubation of a
sample at high hydrostatic pressure as well as the manipulation
of the composition and concentration of the dissolved gasses in
the medium during incubation. It is designed for both static and
ﬂow-through experiments and allows for sub-sampling the liquid
phase including the dissolved gases without decompression. The
key objective was to build a moderately priced incubation system
that can easily be constructed and operated. To keep costs low we
used standardized off-the-shelf items and only a few custom-made
parts.

With this system not only microbiological experiments under
high hydrostatic and gas partial pressure can be performed. Geo-
chemical experiments, for example the extraction of organic and
inorganic compounds from rock samples under speciﬁc pressure
and temperature conditions or mineral alteration studies are also
possible.

Initial tests of the system included applications for geochemical
and microbiological experiments. The effect of high concentra-
tions of CO2 dissolved in water on the release of low molecular
weight organic acids from sub-bituminous coal from the Waikato
Basin (NZ) was studied, as well as the effect of high methane
partial pressure on microbial activity in samples from the Isis mud
volcano (IMV), off the Mediterranean coast of Egypt.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The high-pressure incubation system (Figure 1) is composed of
a reservoir vessel and a reaction vessel for the application of

FIGURE 1 | Schematic drawing of the high-pressure incubation system. The medium is pressurized and enriched with gas in the reservoir vessel prior to
ﬂowing through the incubator sleeve that hangs inside the reaction vessel. Pressure in the reaction vessel is set and kept constant by a HPLC pump and a
backpressure valve.

High-pressure incubations

hydrostatic pressure on an incubator sleeve, which hangs inside
the pressure vessel and holds the sample. A sub-sampling sys-
tem allows the retrieval of liquid subsamples during the exper-
iment without decompression. Temperature is maintained by a
heating/cooling bath (Julabo Labortechnik GmbH, Seelbach, Ger-
many) that pumps the liquid through heating jackets around
the reservoir and the reaction vessel. Medium is circulated in a
closed loop and HPLC pumps maintain hydrostatic pressure. A
photograph of the entire unit is shown in Figure 2.

For microbiological experiments all parts of the high-pressure

incubation system can be sterilized by autoclaving.

RESERVOIR VESSEL
The task of the temperature-controlled reservoir vessel is to satu-
rate the medium with gas to the desired level and to hold a reservoir
of medium that is pumped through the system.

The reservoir vessel is stainless steel cylinder (Dunze GmbH,
Hamburg, Germany), with a volume of 255 cm3 (inner dimen-
sions: 3.4 cm diameter, 28.15 cm high; Figure 3A). Top and bottom
are closed with plugs with bores for 1/16
HPLC lines to allow for
transfer of gas and medium in and out of the vessel.

(cid:2)(cid:2)

REACTION VESSEL
The reaction vessel (Figure 3B) is a stainless steel cylinder (Dunze
GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). The cylinder has an inner diameter
of 3.5 and 27.0 cm in length (volume of 259.7 cm3). Top and bot-
tom are closed with plugs, each with bores for four 1/16
HPLC
lines each. The vessel is sealed with banjo screws that push the
plugs into their seals.

(cid:2)(cid:2)

INCUBATOR SLEEVE
The incubator (Figure 3C) is a sleeve of polyvinylidene ﬂuoride
(PVDF, Novoplast, Halberstadt, Germany), a polymer that is inert

(cid:2)(cid:2)

to almost all chemicals. Although this material is not as ﬂexible
as polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) or ﬂuorinated ethylene propy-
lene (FEP), it was chosen due to its very low permeability for
gases (Table 1). The sleeve is closed with two gold-coated stain-
less steel plugs (3 μm gold thickness; Schempp and Decker, Berlin,
Germany) with two gutters, each holding a perﬂuoro-elastomer
O-ring (FFKM, Parker Hanniﬁn, Pleidelsheim, Germany). FFKM
was used for its chemical resistance. Both stoppers have a central
threaded bore for the connection with a 1/16
HPLC line: one
for inﬂow of medium at the bottom of the incubator and one for
outﬂow at the top of the incubator. The incubator was designed
to avoid corrosion, therefore only inert materials (PVDF, FFKM,
and gold) were used. The sleeve has a diameter of 25 mm and
can have a maximum length of 22 cm, which leads to a maximum
volume of 68 cm3. Inside the incubator the medium ﬁrst has to
pass through a 1.5 cm thick layer of 2 mm diameter glass beads,
followed by a 1.5 cm thick layer of quartz wool (organic free by
annealing in a mufﬂe furnace) so that the stream of medium passes
evenly through the sample material over the entire cross section
of the incubator sleeve. On top of the sample, the described layers
follow in opposite order; ﬁrst quartz wool for holding back most
of the ﬁne particles that could clog the lines and valves, followed by
glass beads until the incubator is full and the sample well packed.
Additional to the chemical resistance and the almost complete
impermeability for gases, further advantages of using a PVDF
sleeve is its relatively low price, allowing for the possibility of using
it as a disposable article. Thereby, cross contamination between
samples can be excluded. Furthermore, mechanical stress leading
to a weakening of the material and, therefore, a possible leakage of
medium or inﬂow of pressure ﬂuid will be prevented. The incuba-
tor sleeve hangs inside the reaction vessel and is connected to the
(cid:2)(cid:2)
top plug of the incubation vessel via the 1/16

HPLC lines.

SUB-SAMPLING SYSTEM
A sub-sampling device allows taking ﬂuid samples during the
experiment without decompression (Figure 3D). It is attached
to the high-pressure line between the reservoir vessel and the reac-
tion vessel. The sub-sampler is made from 1/4
stainless steel
tubing (7.9 cm in length, inner diameter 0.225 cm, total volume
0.513 cm3) and has a three-way-valve (Swagelok Limited, Tro-
mode, UK) at the top and a shut-off valve (Supelco) at the bottom.
The three-way-valve connects the sub-sampler to the incubation
system. The third connection of the valve is used to either apply
vacuum to the sub-sampler prior to sampling to avoid oxidation of
the sample or to apply overpressure (nitrogen gas) to push out the
remainder of the sample. After the sub-sampler is evacuated, the
three-way-valve is turned and the sample enters the sub-sampler.
Then the three-way-valve is closed and the shut-off valve at the
bottom of the system is opened and the sample transferred into a
sampling vial. Nitrogen Gas is added through the three-way-valve
to push out the remaining sample.

GAGES AND PUMPS, OTHER HARDWARE
Pressure is generated by a modiﬁed HPLC pressure pump (SYKAM
S 1122, Sykam GmbH, Fuerstenfeldbruck, Germany, modiﬁcations
according to Kallmeyer et al., 2003). A second identical pump is
used to circulate the medium through the reservoir vessel and the
incubator sleeve. Pressure is kept constant through a backpressure
valve (pressure regulator series KHB, Swagelok Limited, Tromode,
UK).

All pressure vessels (reservoir and reaction vessel) are connected
to 100 MPa pressure gages (WIKA Alexander Wiegand SE and Co.

with 1/16
HPLC lines (CS Chromatographie, Langerwehe, Ger-
many). If not mentioned otherwise all valves were obtained from
Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA.

GAS TRAP
To avoid the possible entry of gas bubbles into the pump, an
empty HPLC column (25.1 cm in length, inner diameter 0.45 cm,
total volume 4 cm3; Sykam GmbH, Fuerstenfeldbruck, Germany)
is used as a gas trap, mounted vertically between the reaction ves-
sel and the pump to collect any gas bubbles that may form. The
medium ﬂows from top to bottom, so the gas bubbles are trapped
at the top.

High-pressure incubations

APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM
We used the system for the extraction of low molecular weight
organic acids, which are a potential microbial energy source, from a
coal sample using water and water–carbon dioxide mixture at 90˚C
and 5 MPa. In a second application we incubated sediment from
a mud volcano that is known to exhibit high rates of anaerobic
methane oxidation at 23˚C and 10 MPa total pressure and 4 MPa
methane partial pressure (96 mmol/l) and measured an increase
in sulﬁde concentration.

COAL SAMPLE
We selected a sub-bituminous coal sample [vitrinite reﬂectance
(R0): 0.29%] from the Whangamarino formation (latest Miocene
to late Pliocene), which is part of the Tauranga group. The sam-
ple was from a depth of 64.69 m below surface, taken from the
DEBITS-1 well, which was drilled in 2004 within the scope of
the deep biosphere in terrestrial systems (DEBITS) project at
Ohinewai in the Waikare Coal Field of the Waikato Basin on the
North Island of New Zealand.

The well had a total depth of 148 m and penetrated interbedded
layers of organic-rich carbon (lignites and sub-bituminous coals)
as well as mudstones, siltstones, and sandstones. The total organic
carbon (TOC) content in the sample is approximately 30%. For
further information about the sample material and the geology of
the Waikato Basin see Glombitza et al. (2009).

Low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) such as for-
mate, acetate, and oxalate are known to be the main organic
compounds obtained from aqueous extractions of lignites and
coals (Vieth et al., 2008). The LMWOAs are also components
of the macromolecular organic material of the coal (Glombitza
et al., 2009) and are released from the coal matrix during ongoing
maturation into the surrounding pore water.

MUD VOLCANO SEDIMENT
Isis mud volcano lies on the Egyptian continental margin in the
Nile deep-sea fan (NDSF) in a water depth of ∼991 m and cov-
ers an area of approximately 10 km2. The NDSF is a sedimentary
wedge that is deposited since the late Miocene by the Nile river
(Loncke et al., 2004) with an assumed thickness of up to 10 km.
Deeper sediments become strongly overpressured by the thick sed-
imentary overburden, resulting in an upward migration of ﬂuids
and gases (Loncke et al., 2004). Among other mud volcanoes in
the area, IMV is emitting large volumes of gas (Dupré et al., 2008),
including methane, ethane, and propane (Mastalerz et al., 2009).
These gases are probably a mixture from different sources, because
their isotopic composition is rather inconclusive with regards to a
thermogenic or microbial origin (Mastalerz et al., 2007).

The emitted gases – mostly methane – are substrates for
microorganisms. In sediment samples of the IMV Omoregie
et al. (2009) found several genera of sulfate-reducing bacteria
(Desulfosarcina, Desulfococcus, Desulfocapsa, Desulfobulbus) as well
as Methanococcoides, a methanogenic Archea, and the anaerobic
methane oxidizers ANME-1, ANME-2, and ANME-3.

(cid:2)

The sample was taken during the NAUTINIL expedition in
2003 at 32˚22
E in 1020 m water depth and stored in
a glass bottle at 4˚C with a nitrogen headspace. About a week
prior to the experiments, the headspace was ﬂushed with methane.

N; 31˚23

(cid:2)

Immediately prior to the incubation experiments, concentration
of hydrogen sulﬁde and methane in the pore water was around 6
and 4.8 mmol/l, respectively.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
We extracted the coal sample at elevated temperature (90˚C) and
pressure (5 MPa) using deionized water in the ﬁrst experiment and
a water–carbon dioxide mixture in the second. Five grams (approx.
9.4 cm3) of the freeze-dried and powdered coal sample were placed
in the incubator sleeve. For the water extraction, the experiment
was started after reservoir and reaction vessel had reached 5 MPa
and 90˚C. In the second experiment with the H2O–CO2 mixture,
gas was added to the reservoir vessel after heating to 90˚C and left
overnight for equilibration. The experiment and the circulation
of the gas-saturated medium started after equilibration. Pressure
was generated by adding CO2 until 5 MPa were reached and pres-
sure had stabilized as maximum gas saturation had been reached
(approximately 106 g/l or 2.4 mol/l of dissolved CO2).

Extractions were carried out for a total of 48 h. Subsam-
ples (0.513 cm3) of the medium were taken after 6, 22, 30,
and 48 h and ﬂushed into 513 μl of a 3.6/3.4 mmol/l solution
of Na2CO3/NaHCO3 containing 2% isopropanol to reduce the
volatility of the LMWOAs thereby avoiding a loss of these com-
pounds. The subsamples were immediately frozen until analy-
sis (within 1 week). Sample analysis was performed by ion
chromatography (IC) without further dilution.

The incubation of sediment samples from IMV was performed
at a pressure of 10 MPa and a temperature of 23˚C, using an arti-
ﬁcial seawater medium (Widdel and Bak, 1992) with a sulfate
concentration of 27 mmol/l.

In the ﬁrst experiment the medium contains just 0.1 mmol/l
of methane (from the dilution of the sediment sample pore water
methane), whereas in the second experiment the medium con-
tained 96 mmol/l methane. In order to be able to detect even small
amounts of hydrogen sulﬁde, the volume of the reservoir vessel was
reduced to 145 ml by adding glass beads (5 mm diameter). Inside
an anaerobic glove box 10 cm3 of IMV sediment were loaded into
the incubator sleeve. The experiment with only artiﬁcial anoxic
seawater medium was started after reservoir and reaction vessel
were equilibrated to 10 MPa and 23˚C. In the second experiment
the medium was ﬁrst pressurized with methane to 4 MPa, leading
to a methane concentration of approximately 1.6 g/l or 96 mmol/l
of dissolved methane and left overnight for equilibration. After
methane saturation was complete, pressure was increased hydro-
statically to 10 MPa with anoxic artiﬁcial seawater medium. The
sample was loaded into the incubation vessel and pressurized prior
to the experiment; circulation of the gas-saturated medium started
after equilibration.

Incubations were carried out for a total of 432 h (9 days). Sub-
samples (0.513 cm3) of the medium were taken every 2 days. The
subsamples were mixed with equal volumes of a 5% (w/v) zinc
acetate solution to ﬁx the volatile sulﬁde as zinc sulﬁde. The ﬁxed
subsamples were immediately frozen until photometric analysis.

SAMPLE ANALYSIS BY ION CHROMATOGRAPHY
The samples were analyzed in replicates using IC. The IC sys-
tem (Sykam GmbH, Fuerstenfeldbruck, Germany) was equipped

High-pressure incubations

with an LCA A 20 column, a suppressor (SAMS, SeQuant, Swe-
den) and a SYKAM S3115 conductivity detector. The mobile
phase was a 1.8/1.7 mmol/l Na2CO3/NaHCO3 mixture. Elu-
tion was performed at isocratic conditions. The eluent ﬂow
was set to 0.8 ml/min. A blank sample (deionized water) and
a multi-compound standard containing each 50 mg/l formate,
acetate, and oxalate (for the extraction of coal) were measured
prior to each sample. Standard deviation of sample and stan-
dard quantiﬁcation was below 10% (determined from replicate
analysis).

HYDROGEN SULFIDE QUANTIFICATION
Hydrogen sulﬁde concentration was quantiﬁed according to Cline
(1969). In brief, 5 ml of deionized water and 400 μl of Cline-
reagent (1.6 g of N,N -dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate plus
2.4 g of FeCl3·6H2O in 100 ml 50% HCl) are added to the sam-

ple. Adsorption is measured in a photometer at 680 nm after
20 min. The minimum detection limit with a 1 cm cell is around
50 μmol/l.

RESULTS
The main organic compounds extracted with water at 5 MPa
and 90˚C are formate, acetate, and oxalate. Vieth et al. (2008)
reported comparable results from aqueous Soxhlet extraction of
similar sample material from the DEBITS-1 well. The amounts
of extracted LMWOAs increase over the course of the experiment
(Figure 4, blue circles). The strongest increase in concentration of
LMWOAs was observed during the ﬁrst 22 h of extraction. In the
following 26 h a slow but steady increase of extracted LMWOA was
observed, suggesting that the experiment did not run to comple-
tion after 48 h. Nevertheless, the yields of the extracted LMWOAs
are approaching steady state. Total amounts of extracted LMWOAs
after 48 h were 2.3 mg/gTOC formate, 3.8 mg/gTOC acetate, and
5.2 mg/gTOC oxalate.

In the second coal extraction experiment we used an H2O–
CO2 mixture under the same pressure and temperature condi-
tions (90˚C, 5 MPa) but with 2.4 mol/l CO2. Under these con-
ditions, the same organic compounds (formate, acetate, and
oxalate) were extracted (Figure 4, green circles). Like in the
experiment with deionized water, the amounts of extracted
LMWOAs increase with increasing extraction time, with the main
increase during the ﬁrst 20 h. The total amounts of extracted
LMWOAs after 48 h were 2.4 mg/gTOC for formate, 2.7 mg/gTOC
for acetate, and 4.5 mg/gTOC for oxalate. These numbers are
somewhat lower than in the pure water extraction experiment
(Figure 4).

During the ﬁrst 48 h of both IMV sediment incubation
experiment, hydrogen sulﬁde concentration increased to about
0.3 mmol/l due to the mixing of the sediment’s pore water hydro-
gen sulﬁde with the medium. Over the course of the ﬁrst exper-
iment the concentration remained around 0.3 mmol/l for the
remainder of the experiment (Figure 5, red circles).

In the second experiment with the added methane (4 MPa,
96 mmol/l), sulﬁde concentration remained around 0.3 mmol/l
until ca. 144 h, before increasing almost exponentially (Figure 5,
blue circles). The experiment was stopped after 432 h at a hydrogen
sulﬁde concentration of 0.93 mmol/l.

FIGURE 4 | Extraction of (A) formate, (B) acetate, and (C) oxalate from
sub-bituminous coal sample taken from the DEBITS-1 well at Waikato
Coal Area, North Island, New Zealand. Five grams of coal (approximately
30% TOC) were extracted for 48 h at 5 MPa and 90˚C. Extractions were
performed with water (blue circles) and water–carbon dioxide mixture
(green triangles). Sample analysis was performed by ion chromatography.

DISCUSSION
The extracted LMWOAs (formate, acetate, and oxalate) have also
been found to be the main organic acids obtained from water
extraction of other low mature coals (Bou-Raad et al., 2000; Vieth
et al., 2008; Glombitza, 2011).

High-pressure (5 MPa) extraction with pure water in our sys-
tem resulted in signiﬁcantly higher yields (2.4–4.5 mg organic
acids/gTOC) than what was reported from Soxhlet extraction of
coal samples from a similar depth interval of the DEBITS-1 well,
which yielded between 0.7 and 1.4 mg organic acid/gTOC for indi-
vidual LMWOAs (Vieth et al., 2008). The extraction of LMWOAs
resulted in a decrease of pH in the extraction medium. The pH in

the reservoir of a Soxhlet apparatus decreases to approximately pH
4 after 48 h of extraction with deionized water (data not shown).
However, the sample only gets into contact with freshly distilled
water (pH 7) that drips over the sample. In the high-pressure sys-
tem the extraction medium containing the extracted organic acids
circulates through the system, thereby extracting the coal with a
low-pH medium. The lower pH is supposed to enhance the release
of LMWOAs from macromolecular organic matter in the coal
by hydrolysis (Glombitza, 2011). This might explain the higher
extraction yields of LMWOAs in our reactor system as compared
to Soxhlet extraction.

Under in situ conditions, the extracted LMWOAs will remain
in the pore water and thereby cause a drop in pH before they are
eventually removed by diffusion or ﬂuid ﬂow. As Fry et al. (2009)
reported from samples from the DEBITS-1 well, the majority of
microbial activity and abundance is not found in the coals but
rather in the surrounding and more porous sandstones. So the
consumption of the produced LMWOA does not take place inside
the coal seams but above or below them and removal of these
substances from the coals is controlled by diffusion or ﬂuid ﬂow,
not by microbial activity. It is therefore reasonable to assume that
our high-pressure system provides reaction conditions that are
much more realistic than Soxhlet extraction because the extracted
compounds are not removed from the reaction.

When comparing the results of the ﬁrst extraction with deion-
ized water and the second extraction with an H2O–CO2 mixture,
it becomes obvious that CO2 reduces the amount of extracted
acetate by a factor of 1.39 and oxalate by a factor of 1.16. For for-
mate no clear inﬂuence of CO2 on the extraction efﬁciency could
be observed. At ﬁrst sight, this result is surprising because car-
bon dioxide dissolved in water lowers the pH due to formation
of carbonic acid (Meyassami et al., 1992). The lower pH was

expected to enhance hydrolysis and, therefore, increase the yield of
extractable LMWOAs. However, we observed a suppressing effect
of CO2.

The LMWOAs found in the extraction ﬂuid may not just result
from the actual extraction of the coal but also from different
secondary reactions. It was suggested that oxalate in aqueous
extracts of coals is a result of the decomposition of 1,2-dihydroxy-
carboxylic acids (Bou-Raad et al., 2000). Therefore it has to be
assumed that at least for oxalate (and maybe for other LMWOAs
as well) the extraction yield is not only affected by hydrolysis but
also by secondary reactions, which may be inhibited or suppressed
in the presence of CO2 in the extraction medium.

The incubation experiment with sediment samples from the
Isis mud volcano clearly showed the positive effect of elevated
methane concentration on the rate of sulﬁde production, which is
a direct result of sulfate reduction. Omoregie et al. (2009) con-
ducted whole core 35SO2−
radiotracer incubations of samples
from the same mud volcano at atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa)

and with a maximum methane concentration of >10 μmol l

They measured sulfate reduction rates of 7–240 nmol cm
We conducted our experiment at much higher methane concen-
−1) and in situ pressure (10 MPa), and measured
tration (96 mmol l
−3
a signiﬁcantly higher sulfate reduction rate of ca. 2000 nmol cm
−1, which we attribute to the elevated methane concentration,
day
as already shown by Nauhaus et al. (2002).

The aim of this paper is to present a new high-pressure incu-
bation system and experiments to demonstrate the application of
elevated temperature and pressure as well the use of elevated gas
saturation and their effects on geochemical and microbiological
processes. Therefore, we can only speculate about the reasons for
the observed suppressing effect of the CO2. This effect still remains
puzzling and will be the topic of future investigations.

High-pressure incubations

CONCLUSION
The high-pressure high-temperature incubation system is a mod-
erately priced alternative to existing systems. Furthermore, it is
easy to construct and to handle. Initial experiments demon-
strate that the system is suitable for a wide range of appli-
cations in geo- and bio-sciences. The system allows the incu-
bations at elevated pressure and temperature conditions (up
to 120˚C and 60 MPa) as well as manipulating the dissolved
gases throughout the experiment. The system also allows sub-
sampling of the ﬂuid phase during the course of the experiment
without decompression. Extraction of a sub-bituminous coal
samples under high-pressure and temperature conditions showed
a higher yield in LMWOAs from macromolecular organic mat-
ter as compared to an extraction with a Soxhlet apparatus. The
high-pressure extraction of the coal sample with CO2-saturated
water revealed a suppressing effect of the CO2 on the extrac-
tion yield or secondary formations of LMWOAs. Possible reasons
for this effect are not identiﬁed yet and will be in the focus of
future investigations. The incubation of sediment samples from a

mud volcano harboring sulfate-reducing methanotrophs showed
a clear positive response of methane addition on the sulfate
reduction rate. Our high-pressure high-temperature incubation
system has proven its suitability for a broad range of scientiﬁc
applications.
