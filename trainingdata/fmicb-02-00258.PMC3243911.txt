Human APOBEC3 (A3) proteins are cellular cytidine deaminases that potently restrict the
replication of retroviruses by hypermutating viral cDNA and/or inhibiting reverse transcrip-
tion. There are seven members of this family including A3A, B, C, DE, F, G, and H, all
encoded in a tandem array on human chromosome 22. A3F and A3G are the most potent
inhibitors of HIV-1, but only in the absence of the virus-encoded protein, Vif. HIV-1 utilizes
Vif to abrogate A3 functions in the producer cells. More speciﬁcally, Vif, serving as a sub-
strate receptor, facilitates ubiquitination of A3 proteins by forming a Cullin5 (Cul5)-based
E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets A3 proteins for rapid proteasomal degradation.
The speciﬁcity of A3 degradation is determined by the ability of Vif to bind to the target.
Several lines of evidence have suggested that three distinct regions of A3 proteins are
involved in the interaction with Vif. Here, we review the biological functions of A3 fam-
ily members with special focus on A3G and base our analysis on the available structural
information.

INTRODUCTION
During coevolution of mammalian organisms and retroelements,
the hosts have developed defense systems to restrict replication of
these elements. The restriction factors include the A3 family of
DNA cytidine deaminases, which is characterized by the presence
of one or two Zn clusters consisting of (H/C)XE(X)23–28CXXC
motifs (reviewed in Wedekind et al., 2003). In humans, there
are seven members of the A3 family (A3A, B, C, DE, F, G, and
H), each encoded in a tandem array on chromosome 22 (Jar-
muz et al., 2002; Figure 1A). Each protein has been found to have
different inhibitory effects on various retroelements that are medi-
ated by cytidine deamination and other mechanisms (reviewed in
Goila-Gaur and Strebel, 2008; Albin and Harris, 2010). In order
to overcome A3 antiviral activity, the viruses have acquired their
own strategies (Yu, 2006). HIV-1 encodes the Vif protein to coun-
teract the most potent inhibitors, human A3G (hA3G) and A3F
(Sheehy et al., 2002; Wiegand et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2004;
Simon et al., 2005; Miyagi et al., 2010). Vif binds the A3 pro-
teins and serves as a substrate receptor to recruit the Cul5-based
E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase complex, which facilitates the polyu-
biquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation
(Yu et al., 2003). The elimination of A3 during virus produc-
tion prevents its encapsidation into progeny viruses. Thus, given
Vif ’s critical role in eliminating A3 function, it may be viewed as
one of the most attractive pharmacologic targets for an anti-HIV
drug, which would restore the activity of the intrinsic antiviral
factor in the context of HIV infection. Here, we brieﬂy review
what is known about A3-Vif interactions and the subsequent

ubiquitination, based on the available biological and structural
information.

THE HUMAN A3 FAMILY OF CYTIDINE DEAMINASES
The seven members of the human A3 family have a deﬁning fea-
ture: each protein has one or two conserved zinc (Z)-coordinating
deaminase domains. Zinc coordination is mediated by a histidine
and two cysteines, which form a catalytic center for a cytidine
deaminase activity. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the Z
domains fall into three types: Z1 [A3A and the C-terminal half
domains (CTD) of A3B and A3G], Z2 [A3C, both halves of A3DE
and A3F, and the N-terminal domains (NTD) of A3B and A3G],
and Z3 (A3H; LaRue et al., 2009; Figure 1A). Within the Z2 types,
the domain can be further subdivided into three subgroups based
on the identity of the amino acid sequence: (1) the A3F NTD; (2)
the A3G NTD; (3) the A3F CTD (Figure 1B). Each subgroup has
highly conserved amino acid sequences. For example, A3F CTD is
77 and 88% identical to A3C and A3DE CTD, respectively, whereas
it is 42% identical to A3G NTD. As described in more detail below,
only the Z3 type (A3H) and the Z2 type (more speciﬁcally, the
A3G NTD and the A3F CTD subgroups) contain a critical inter-
face for binding HIV-1 Vif (Figure 1B). It is thought that there
is a common structural feature for the organization of cytidine
deaminases: all Z domains are believed to have a conserved core
structure composed of ﬁve β-strands (β1–β5) and six α-helices
(α1–α6; Figure 2A). Although, to date, only the three-dimensional
structure of the A3G CTD has been determined by NMR (Chen
et al., 2008; Furukawa et al., 2009) or by X-ray crystallography

Structural basis of A3-Vif interaction

African green monkeys, determines species speciﬁcity by inﬂu-
encing Vif–A3G binding (Bogerd et al., 2004; Mangeat et al., 2004;
Schrofelbauer et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004). In addition, extensive
site-direct mutagenesis revealed that the 128DPD130 motif of A3G,
located at the loop between β4 and α4 shown in red (Figures 2B,C),
is crucial for direct binding to HIV-1 Vif (Huthoff and Malim,
2007). Furthermore, there is a report that residue T32, which may
be potentially phosphorylated by protein kinase A, is also involved
in the Vif–A3G interaction by collaborating with R24 (Shirakawa
et al., 2008). All of these critical residues are mapped on the vari-
able loop structure in proximity to the nucleic acid binding surface
(Figure 2B).

In contrast, two independent studies have shown that two C-
terminal A3F residues, E289 and E324, located in helices α3 and α4,
respectively, are critical for the interaction with HIV-1 Vif (Albin
et al., 2010; Smith and Pathak, 2010). Interestingly, in the struc-
tural model of the A3F CTD, these two residues are close to some
negatively charged surface residues although the location of these
residues is separate from 128DPD130. In accord with phylogenetic
similarities, A3F E289 and E324 are highly conserved in hA3C
(E106 and E141) and hA3DE CTD (E302 and E337). These ﬁnd-
ings suggest that structural features of the Vif-binding interfaces
might be conserved among the A3F CTD, A3C, and A3DE CTD,
but different from the A3G NTD. In the case of A3H, the interface
for Vif is likely to have a surface area close to that of 128DPD130
in the A3G NTD. The A3H gene is polymorphic, with four major
haplotypes in humans. The four proteins have different levels of
antiviral activity and sensitivity to HIV-1 Vif, in which haplotype
II has the highest antiviral activity (Dang et al., 2008a; OhAinle
et al., 2008; Harari et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010).
By comparing the A3H variants, Zhen et al. (2010) identiﬁed a
critical residue, E121, in A3H haplotype II for binding to HIV-
1 (Figures 2B,C). Because the identity of amino acid sequences
between Z2 and Z3 types, particularly the β4–α4 loop and the α4,
is quite low, it is assumed that the putative Vif interface structure of
A3H might be different from those of the A3G NTD or A3F CTD.

RESIDUES OF HIV-1 VIF THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR BINDING A3
PROTEINS
Extensive mutational analysis of HIV-1 Vif has led to the charac-
terization of several distinct motifs in HIV-1 Vif that are required
for formation of the Cul5-based E3 Ub ligase complex and recruit-
ment of human A3 proteins (reviewed in Albin and Harris, 2010;
Figure 3). The C-terminal half of Vif contains three conserved
motifs: (1) the HCCH domain, which chelates zinc mediates the
interaction with Cul5; (2) the SLQ motif, which binds elongin C
(Elo C); and (3) the PPLP motif, which is important for Vif dimer-
ization and recruitment of A3G, albeit by an unknown mechanism.
Meanwhile, the N-terminal half of Vif is involved in the interaction
with A3 proteins. Figure 3 shows the compiled map of the critical
residues that have been identiﬁed by several groups (Schrofelbauer
et al., 2006; Tian et al., 2006; Russell and Pathak, 2007; He et al.,
2008; Zhang et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Pery et al., 2009; Zhen
et al., 2010; Binka et al., 2011). Overall, it appears that the criti-
cal residues for binding to each Z domain type are discontinuous.
This suggests that the interfaces in Vif might be determined by
conformational constraints.

FIGURE 1 | Three types of Z domains in human A3 family. (A) Seven
members of human A3 family, encoded by human chromosome 22, are
illustrated. The protein products consist of one or two Z domains, each of
which is phylogenetically grouped into three distinct types: Z1, Z2, and Z3.
(B) Three subgroups of the Z2 domains are enclosed with dotted lines in
the phylogenetic tree. The arrows point to the domains that are responsible
for HIV-1 Vif interaction.

FIGURE 2 | Model structure of A3G NTD and location of responsible
residues for Vif interaction. (A) Ribbon diagram of the A3 core structure
for the model is depicted based on the crystal structure of the A3G CTD
(PDB ID# 3IR2). The loop regions are removed. The α helices (α1–6) and β
sheets (β1–5) are shown in red and yellow, respectively. (B,C) In the
structure model, the amino acid determinants, T32, R24, and 128DPD130, for
A3G are colored in red. The analogous residues T106 and K141 in A3F E289
and E324 (blue), and E133, corresponding to A3H E121 (green) are also
shown. The critical residues, 125YFW127, for nucleic acid binding are colored
in orange. (C) Predicted surface of the A3G NTD model is shown. All the
critical residues are predicted to be surface exposed.

(Holden et al., 2008; Shandilya et al., 2010), no structure of the Z
domain having an HIV-1 Vif interface has been solved yet.

THREE DISTINCT INTERFACES OF A3 Z DOMAINS INTERACT

Structural basis of A3-Vif interaction

FIGURE 3 | Map of critical residues in HIV-1 Vif. Important domains in Vif
(HIV-1 HXB2) are illustrated in the schematic diagram. The domains labeled
“A3,” “Cul5,” and “Elo C” are responsible for Vif’s functional interactions. The
“A3” domain is responsible for binding to A3 family proteins. The amino acid
sequence motifs, “HCCH,” “SLQ,” and “PPLP” are important for binding to

Cul5, and Elo C, and Vif dimerization, respectively. The positions and the
names of amino acid residues that were identiﬁed by several groups are
shown. The residues that were identiﬁed as important for forming an interface
with human A3 proteins are mapped in Vif, i.e., A3G (red), A3F, A3C, and
A3DE (blue), and A3H (green).

Interestingly, some residues are unique among the three types
of Z domains, suggesting that such residues might determine bind-
ing speciﬁcity. For example, K22, K26, Y30, Y40, H43, Y44, and L59
are important for interaction only with A3G, whereas the residues
W11, M16, R17, L24, V25, and W79 are required for speciﬁc inter-
actions with A3F. These residues tend to have two characteristics:
they are positively charged or hydrophobic. Interestingly, the elec-
trostatic charge of the Vif residues is mostly positive whereas the
key residues that comprise the A3 interfaces are negatively charged.
Thus, such electrostatic interactions might be one of the com-
mon features for binding between human A3 proteins and HIV-1
Vif. This could also determine the species-speciﬁc interactions
between Vif and A3 proteins, as demonstrated in the case of Vif–
A3G (Bogerd et al., 2004; Mangeat et al., 2004; Schrofelbauer et al.,
2004; Xu et al., 2004). In contrast to the aforementioned regions,
there are some aromatic or hydrophobic residues, W5, W21, W38,
W70, and W89, which are commonly responsible for binding to
two (the A3G NTD and the A3F CTD), or L64, I66, Y69, and L72 to
all types of Z domains. These regions could play fundamental roles
in maintaining the overall conformation of A3-binding interfaces
or could form a partly shared structure of the interface for either
two or all Z domains.

VIF-MEDIATED UBIQUITINATION/DEGRADATION
Information concerning the speciﬁc interaction between Vif and
A3G in the E3 Ub ligase complex suggests that there may be a
speciﬁc mechanism for Ub conjugation of the A3G protein. Pre-
viously, our studies using structure-guided mutagenesis demon-
strated that four lysine residues (K297, 301, 303, and 334) near the
C-terminal end of A3G are critical sites for HIV-1 Vif-mediated
A3G ubiquitination and degradation (Iwatani et al., 2009). The
data suggested that these sites, which are located on the oppo-
site end of A3G relative to the Vif-binding interface, might be
speciﬁcally dictated by the rigid structure of the Cul5-based scaf-
fold. In addition, the study clearly demonstrated that the addi-
tional residues, particularly lysines near the C-terminal tag of A3G
could be potential targets for Vif-induced ubiquitination. How-
ever, recently, Wang et al. (2011) showed that a detectable level of
Vif-mediated ubiquitination occurs at the N-terminus in addition

to certain lysine residues within 20 lysine residues of A3G. In
contrast, another group could detect no N-terminal ubiquitina-
tion (Dang et al., 2008b). Although these apparent contradictions
might be due to differences in the detection level of ubiquitina-
tion, it is important to consider the possibility that different tags
attached at the C-terminal end of an A3G protein could create
potential ubiquitination sites and/or mask the area where the four
lysine residues are located (Iwatani et al., 2009). Moreover, while
ubiquitination is associated primarily with the lysines in the CTD,
the observation that there is also N-terminal ubiquitination could
be of interest. The evidences of two distal ubiquitination sites in
A3G may provide important structural insight, which implies two
distinct types of structural conﬁguration for Vif–A3G interaction.
Further studies are needed to clarify Vif-mediated ubiquitination
in the context of the E3 Ub ligase complex and to allow us to answer
the following two questions: (1) How can we rationalize the rela-
tionship between the conﬁguration of the N-terminal end and the
proximal Vif-binding interface? (2) In particular, how can the Ub
molecules be conjugated at the N-terminus, which is predicted to
be a structurally ﬂexible end?

CONCLUSION
Phylogenetic analyses and genetic studies of A3 and Vif have pro-
vided important evidence for three distinct types of interactions
between human A3 and HIV-1 Vif proteins, which are determined
by the characteristic Z domain types of A3G, A3F/C/DE, and
A3H. Further understanding of Vif–A3 interactions could advance
efforts to develop novel anti-HIV drugs, which would function
as anti-Vif inhibitors. Although presenting a tremendous chal-
lenge, complementary studies focusing on the structure of the
Vif-interactive A3 domain and Vif are also critical to accelerate
future progress in this ﬁeld.
