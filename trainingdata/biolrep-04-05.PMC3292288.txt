Abstract
Approximately 120-130 million individuals are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV)
worldwide, although it is curable by therapy. Until recently, treatment of chronic hepatitis C was based on
the combination of pegylated interferon-a and ribavirin. A number of models have been developed to
study the HCV lifecycle and screen for potential HCV inhibitors. They led to the development of antiviral
agents that specifically target a viral function (direct acting antivirals), and host-targeted agents that inhibit
HCV replication. Direct acting antivirals in clinical development include NS3-4A protease inhibitors (two
of which, telaprevir and boceprevir, have recently been approved for treatment of HCV genotype 1
infection in combination with pegylated interferon-a and ribavirin), nucleoside/nucleotide analogue and
non-nucleoside inhibitors of HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and NS5A inhibitors. Host-
targeted agents include cyclophilin inhibitors. This article describes the direct acting antivirals and host-
targeted agents that have recently been approved or have been tested in HCV-infected patients and
discusses their two current paths of clinical development: with or without interferon-a.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was discovered in 1989 [1]. It was
found to be responsible for the vast majority of so-called
chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis and cryptogenetic liver
diseases [2-4]. In adults, acute HCV infection leads to
chronic infection in approximately 80% of cases. Chronic
HCV infection is responsible for chronic hepatitis, which is
complicated by cirrhosis in approximately 20% of cases.
Patients with cirrhosis are exposed to life-threatening
complications, including end-stage liver disease, esopha-
geal varices hemorrhage and the development of hepato-
cellular carcinoma, which occurs at an incidence of 4%-
5% per year in these patients [5]. Approximately 120-130
million individuals are chronically infected with HCV
worldwide [6]. Chronic HCV infection has become the
leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver
cancer) and the first indication of liver transplantation in
industrialized countries [5]. Six genotypes (1 to 6) and a
number of subtypes have been described. Genotype 1
(subtypes 1a and 1b) is by far the most frequent genotype
worldwide [7].

Unlike other known chronic viral infections, HCV infec-
tion is curable by therapy. Cure of infection is character-
ized by the “sustained virological response”, defined as
undetectable HCV RNA in peripheral blood by means of
sensitive molecular biology-based techniques. Until
recently, treatment of chronic hepatitis C was based on
the combination of a pegylated form of interferon (IFN)-a
(pegylation improves the pharmacokinetic and pharma-
codynamic properties and enhances the antiviral potency
of IFN) and ribavirin [8-10]. This combination cures
approximately 80% of infections in patients infected with
HCV genotypes 2 or 3, but only 40%-50% in patients
infected with genotypes 1 or 4. This emphasizes the need
for more efficient antiviral strategies.

Over the past 10 years, a number of models have been
developed to study the HCV lifecycle and screen for
potential HCV inhibitors [11]. These models include cell-
free enzyme assays for the HCV NS3-4A protease and
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, hepatoma cell lines
harboring subgenomic and genomic replicons (nucleic

acids capable of autonomous replication), an infectious
cell culture system (limited to genotype 2a), and
humanized mouse models infectable by HCV. They led
to the development of antiviral agents that specifically
target a viral function, now collectively termed “direct
acting antivirals”. In addition, “host-targeted agents” that
inhibit HCV replication are also in development. This
article describes the direct acting antivirals that have
recently been approved and direct acting antivirals and
host-targeted agents that have been tested in HCV-infected
patients and discusses their current paths of clinical
development: with or without IFN-a.

several drug families that block viral replication, including
nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors of
the HCV RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase, non-nucleoside inhibitors
of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and inhibi-
tors of the NS5A viral protein which plays a regulatory role
in replication. Host-targeted agents that inhibit the host
cell protein cyclophilin A, a protein required to interact
with the replication complex for efficient viral genome
production, are also in clinical development. Table 1
summarizes the drugs that have been tested in clinical trials
and for which results have been published or presented at
medical meetings as of November 2011.

New HCV drugs in development
In principle, every step of the HCV lifecycle, including
receptor binding, endocytosis, fusion, uncoating, transla-
tion, polyprotein processing, RNA replication, virion
assembly, maturation, transport and release, can be a
target for new anti-HCV drugs [12]. Thus far, drugs target-
ing two major steps of the HCV lifecycle have reached
clinical development. They include inhibitors of the HCV
NS3-4A protease that block polyprotein processing and

Barrier to resistance of HCV drugs
Like antiretroviral drugs, HCV direct acting antivirals have
been shown to select drug-resistant viral variants, the
outgrowth of which is responsible for virological break-
through and disease progression [13]. In vivo, the “barrier
to resistance” of an HCV drug is influenced by three
parameters: (a) the “genetic barrier to resistance” of the
drug, defined as the number of amino acid substitutions
needed for a viral variant to acquire full resistance to the

drug in question (if a single substitution is sufficient to
confer high-level resistance, the drug is considered to have
a low genetic barrier to resistance, while the need for three
or more substitutions represents a high genetic barrier);
(b) the “in vivo fitness” of the resistant viral variant
population, defined as its ability to survive and grow in
the replicative environment; and (c) drug exposure,
defined as the drug concentration achieved in vivo relative
to the 50% and 90% inhibitory concentrations (in enzyme
assays) and efficient concentrations (in cellular assays)
[13]. HCV drugs in development can be split into two
groups according to their barrier to resistance, including
drugs with a low barrier to resistance, and drugs with a high
barrier to resistance.

HCV drugs with a low barrier to resistance
HCV drugs with a low barrier to resistance include the
following direct acting antivirals: first-generation NS3-4A
protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside inhibitors of HCV
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and NS5A inhibitors.

A large number of NS3-4A protease inhibitors have
reached clinical development,
including two drugs,
telaprevir and boceprevir (Table 1), that have recently
been approved for use in combination with pegylated
IFN-a and ribavirin in patients infected with genotype 1.
NS3-4A protease inhibitors have closely related chemical
structures. They inhibit viral replication by 3.5 to 4.5 Log
international units (IU)/mL when administered alone for
a few days (one log reduction means that the viral level has
been divided by 10, 2 log by 100, etc). Telaprevir and
boceprevir are active against genotypes 1 and 2 only,
whereas other protease inhibitors have broader genotype
coverage; however, none of the first-generation NS3-4A
protease inhibitors are active against genotype 3. A large
number of amino acid substitutions conferring resistance
to protease inhibitors have been shown to pre-exist at
generally low levels in infected patients and are selected
within a few days to weeks on drug monotherapy [13].
Different resistance profiles have been reported for
subtypes 1a and 1b. Second-generation NS3-4A protease
inhibitors, such as MK-5172 or ACH-2684 (Table 1), are
expected to have broader genotypic coverage and higher
barriers to resistance.

Extensive cross-resistance has been reported between
drugs targeting the same site, and cross-resistance can
also occur between drugs targeting different sites.

NS5A inhibitors are potent antiviral drugs that block the
function of the NS5A protein through an, as yet, unclear
mechanism (Table 1). They have broad genotypic cover-
age, but a low barrier to resistance, with the highest levels
of resistance conferred by single amino acid substitutions
in subtype 1a.

the catalytic site of

New HCV drugs with a high barrier to resistance
HCV drugs with a high barrier to resistance include
nucleoside/nucleotide analogues and host-targeted
agents, such as cyclophilin inhibitors. Nucleoside/nucleo-
tide analogues target
the RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase. Several nucleoside and
nucleotide analogues have reached clinical development,
including purine and pyrimidine analogues. They are
effective on all known genotypes and subtypes. Although
these drugs have a low “genetic barrier” to resistance (as
one single amino acid substitution is sufficient to confer
resistance to the drug), these amino acid substitutions alter
the conformation of the enzyme catalytic site. Thus,
resistant variants exhibit low fitness and are not clinically
meaningful. In this respect, nucleoside/nucleotide analo-
gues have a high “barrier” to resistance in vivo, as resistant
viral populations on single drug administration grow very
slowly with virological breakthrough eventually occurring
after months of treatment.

Cyclophilin A plays an important role in the HCV
replication cycle by binding to both NS5A and the RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase within the viral replication
complex. Blocking cyclophilin peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
isomerase enzyme activity results in a significant inhibi-
tion of HCV replication both in vitro and in vivo, through
molecular mechanisms that remain unclear. Because
their target is a host protein, cyclophilin inhibitors have
broad genotypic coverage and a favorable resistance
profile. Amino acid substitutions in the NS5A protein
can be selected by these drugs, but they confer low-level
resistance and the corresponding variants exhibit low
fitness.

In contrast to protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside inhi-
bitors of HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are a
heterogeneous group of drug families targeting one of
four allosteric sites at the surface of the viral enzyme
(Table 1). Their antiviral action is thus far restricted to
HCV genotype 1. Different non-nucleoside inhibitors
may have different antiviral potencies and select amino
acid substitutions conferring resistance that is generally,
but not always, located in close vicinity to their target site.

Newly approved NS3-4A protease inhibitors
The first available direct acting antivirals for clinical
development in patients infected with HCV genotype 1
were the NS3-4A protease inhibitors telaprevir and
boceprevir. Due to their low barrier to resistance, it soon
appeared that they could not be used alone and should be
combined with other compounds with potent antiviral
properties and no cross-resistance with the protease
inhibitors. Only pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin were

available for combination in Phase II and III clinical trials.
It soon became apparent that ribavirin was also needed to
improve the cure rates in combination with pegylated
IFN-a and a protease inhibitor [14]. In 2011, the results of
several Phase III trials have led to the approval of both
telaprevir (Incivek, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, in the US;
Incivo, Janssen,
in Europe) and boceprevir (Victrelis,
Merck) in combination with pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin
[15-18]. Complex treatment algorithms have been issued
in the US Food and Drug Administration and European
Medicines Agency labels, which substantially differ
between the two protease inhibitors (Tables 2 and 3).
Treatment duration must be tailored to the severity of liver
disease, prior virological response to pegylated IFN-a and
ribavirin in previously treated patients, and the virological
response during therapy (response-guided therapy). Sus-
tained virological response rates in the range of 66% to
75% have been achieved in treatment-naïve patients in
Phase III trials, significantly higher than with pegylated
IFN-a and ribavirin alone [16,18]. In previously treated
patients, the results strongly depended on the prior
response to pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin, with sustained
virological response rates of the order of 30% in prior null
responders and up to approximately 85% in prior
responder-relapsers [15,17].

In addition to the complexity of the approved treatment
regimens, the new triple combination therapies raise a
number of issues.

(a) They are restricted to HCV genotype 1.

(b) The addition of a third drug to pegylated IFN-a and
ribavirin is associated with additional, and eventually
severe, side effects. The principal adverse reactions
associated with telaprevir are anemia, pruritus and rash
[17,18]. Rash is observed in approximately half of cases.
It is generally benign and responds well to topical

corticosteroids; however, severe cases have been reported
in clinical trials, including occasional cases of Stevens-
Johnson syndrome and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia
and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. These
complications can be life-threatening and impose rapid
treatment interruption. Therefore, telaprevir therapy
requires strict adherence to the rash management plan,
in close collaboration with experienced dermatologists.
Boceprevir administration is associated with anemia that
aggravates hemolytic anemia due to ribavirin and
dysgueusia [15,16].

(c) Selection of viral variants that are resistant to the
protease inhibitor is an inevitable consequence of treat-
ment failure, i.e. the failure to eradicate the virus on triple
combination therapy. Such failure is due to an inadequate
response to pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin, which does not
prevent outgrowth of resistant variants selected by the
protease inhibitor [13]. After treatment cessation, resistant
viral populations progressively decrease in proportion and
are no longer detectable with population sequencing after
a period of a few months to two years [19-21]. Selection of
resistant HCV variants does not appear to have a negative
impact on the outcome of liver disease. Theoretically, it
should not compromise the chance for a subsequent cure
with another drug regimen.

(d) The addition of a protease inhibitor substantially
increases the cost of therapy, raising issues regarding
screening policies and access to care.

Two paths of clinical development of HCV direct
acting antivirals
Issues raised by the recent approval of telaprevir and
boceprevir in combination with pegylated IFN-a and
ribavirin emphasize the need for alternative therapeutic
strategies that ensure broader genotypic coverage, better
efficacy, better tolerance and limited selection of resistant

HCV variants. The clinical development of new HCV
drugs currently follows two paths, according to whether
or not pegylated IFN-a is included in the drug
combination.

IFN-based regimens
Most of the new direct acting antivirals and host-targeted
agents in development are currently tested as part of
triple combinations with pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin.
The results of Phase II trials have been encouraging
with other NS3-4A protease inhibitors, such as TMC435 or
BI201335 (currently in Phase III evaluation), the NS5A
inhibitor daclatasvir (BMS-790052), or the cyclophilin
inhibitor alisporivir (DEBIO-025, currently in Phase III
evaluation), with sustained virological response rates
of the same order as those with telaprevir and boce-
previr [22-25]. Results of trials with two non-nucleoside
inhibitors, filibuvir and tegobuvir, have been disappoint-
ing. However, this result cannot be generalized to the
wider group of non-nucleoside inhibitors of HCV RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase, as it seems to be essentially
the result of the modest antiviral efficacy of the two
individual compounds. Results are awaited with other
drugs, tested in ongoing clinical trials. As with telaprevir
and boceprevir, the response to IFN and ribavirin is a key
determinant of the final outcome of therapy. It is too early
to say whether the effect of IFN responsiveness will be
attenuated when drugs with a high barrier to resistance are
used in combination with pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin.

Interest was recently raised about quadruple combina-
tion treatment regimens that combine pegylated IFN-a,
ribavirin, and two direct acting antivirals belonging to
different drug classes without cross-resistance. In a study
in patients who previously experienced a null response to

pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin, 10 out of 10 patients
receiving a quadruple combination including both
daclatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor) and asunaprevir (an
NS3-4A protease inhibitor) showed a sustained virologi-
cal response [26]. The number of patients in this study
was too small to draw firm conclusions, and it also
remains to be established whether two drugs with a low
barrier to resistance do better in combination with
pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin than one drug with a
high barrier to resistance, or whether quadruple combi-
nations may be further improved by including at least
one drug with a high barrier to resistance.

All-oral, IFN-free regimens
Enthusiasm about IFN-free regimens has recently risen
dramatically with reports of sustained virological
response rates of the order of 100% in small groups of
patients treated with one or two direct acting antivirals
alone, with or without ribavirin. What is known about
IFN-free regimens can be summarized as follows: (a) the
combination of two oral drugs with a low barrier to
resistance results in early virological breakthroughs due
to the selection of viral populations that are resistant to
both drugs [26-28]; (b) ribavirin accelerates HCV
clearance in combination with direct acting antivirals in
the absence of IFN and is useful for shortening treatment
duration and preventing post-treatment relapses [27];
(c) the use of a nucleotide analogue (PSI-7977) with
ribavirin in patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 and 3
[29], or of a combination of an NS3-4A protease
inhibitor (asunaprevir) and an NS5A inhibitor (dacla-
tasvir) in patients infected with genotype 1b [30], a
population in which daclatasvir has a reasonably high
barrier to resistance, yielded 100% sustained virological
response rates in small groups of patients.

http://f1000.com/reports/b/4/5

Overall, these results provide a proof-of-concept that HCV
infection can be cured by an all-oral IFN-free treatment
regimen within 12 to 24 weeks and that very high
sustained virological response rates can be achieved with
drugs or drug combinations that have a high barrier to
resistance. They strongly suggest that the IFN era is coming
to an end in hepatitis C therapy, although this end cannot
yet be precisely dated. Further results are awaited that will
allow the establishment of an ideal all-oral IFN treatment
regimen for patients with chronic HCV infection.

Conclusion
A new standard-of-care is now available for patients
infected with HCV genotype 1, based on the triple
combination of pegylated IFN-a, ribavirin, and either
telaprevir or boceprevir. However, these new therapies are
associated with increased costs, additional side effects and
more complex treatment strategies, whereas pegylated
IFN-a and ribavirin remain the standard treatment for all
other genotypes, as well as in resource-limited settings
where the cost of these new therapies cannot be afforded.
A universal, cost-effective, well-tolerated all-oral first-line
treatment regimen is needed and will most likely be
available within a few years, when more is known about
the ideal combination of drugs and the optimal doses and
duration. Nevertheless, antiviral
the
solution to definitively eradicate HCV infection, most of
the 120-130 million chronic carriers live in areas where
screening, cost and access to care preclude the use of these
novel therapies. An efficient prophylactic vaccine is still
urgently needed. This will be the next, and probably last,
challenge of the HCV story.
