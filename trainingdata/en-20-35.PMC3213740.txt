ABSTRACT

to 

Dual-specificity  tyrosine  (Y)-phosphorylation-regulated  protein  kinase  1A  (Dyrk1A)  is 
the  mammalian  homologue  of  Drosophila  melanogaster  minibrain  and  its  human  gene 
is  mapped 
the  Down  syndrome  critical  region  of  chromosome  21.  Dyrk1A 
phosphorylates  several  transcription  factors,  including  NFAT  and  CREB  and  a  number 
of  cytosolic  proteins  such  as  APP,  tau,  and  α-synuclein.  Although  Dyrk1A  is  involved 
in  the  control  of  cell  growth  and  postembryonic  neurogenesis,  its  potential  role  during 
cell  death  and  signaling  pathway  is  not  clearly  understood.  In  the  present  study,  we 
show  that  Dyrk1A  is  activated  under  the  condition  of  apoptotic  cell  death.  In  addition, 
Dyrk1A  is  coupled  to  JNK1  activation,  and  directly  interacts  with  apoptosis  signal- 
regulating  kinase  1  (ASK1).  Moreover,  Dyrk1A  positively  regulates  ASK1-mediated 
JNK1-signaling,  and  appears  to  directly  phosphorylate  ASK1.  These  data  indicate  that 
Dyrk1A  regulates  cell  death  through  facilitating  ASK1-mediated  signaling  events.

INTRODUCTION

Dual-specificity  tyrosine  (Y)-phosphorylation-regulated 
protein  kinase  1A  (Dyrk1A)  is  firstly  identified  as 
Minibrain  in  Drosophila  (Tejedor  et  al.,  1995).  Dyrk1A 
is  mapped  within  the  Down  syndrome  (DS)  critical 
region  (a  4-megabase  region  containing  60∼100 
genes  between  markers  D21S17  and  ETS2)  of 
chromosome  21,  which  is  associated  with  a  variety 
of  DS  abnormalities,  including  mental  retardation 
(Smith  et  al.,  1997).  Transgenic  mice  carrying  extra 
copies  of  Dyrk1A  exhibit  neurodevelopmental  delays, 
motor  abnormalities,  and  cognitive  deficits  (Altafaj  et

al.,  2001).  Dyrk1A  knockout  mice  also  show  a 
general  delay  in  fetal  development  and  embryonic 
lethality, 
the  vital  and  non-redundant 
biological  functions  of  Dyrk1A  (Fotaki  et  al.,  2002).
    Diverse  types  of  proteins  have  been  identified  as 
the  substrates  of  Dyrk1A,  including  transcription 
factors,  including  NF-AT  and  Forkhead  (Woods  et 
al.,  2001;  Arron  et  al.,  2006;  Gwack  et  al.,  2006), 
several  endocytosis  and  synaptic  vesicle  recycling 
proteins,  such  as  dynamin  1  and  amphiphysin  1 
(Chen-Hwang  et  al.,  2002;  Murakami  et  al.,  2006), 
and  cytosolic  proteins,  such  as  APP  and  tau  (Ryoo 
et  al.,  2007;  Ryoo  et  al.,  2008),  implying  that  Dyrk1A 
participates  in  various  biological  responses.  Regar-
ding  to  the  functional  role  of  Dyrk1A,  active  Dyrk1A 
phosphorylates  the  transcription  factor  cAMP  res-
ponse  element  (CRE)-binding  protein  (CREB),  which 
subsequently 
the  stimulation  of  CRE-

mediated  gene  transcription  during  neuronal  differen-
tiation  (Yang  et  al.,  2001).  Yak1p,  the  Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae  homolog  of  Dyrk1A,  was  identified  as  a 
functional  antagonist  of  the  RAS/protein  kinase  A 
pathway  and  has  been  characterized  as  a  negative 
regulator  of  growth  (Holtzman  et  al.,  1993;  Raths  et 
al.,  1993).  Thus,  it  is  suggested  that  Dyrk1A  is  a 
key  regulator  of  neuronal  cell  growth  and  differen-
tiation.
    Recently,  Dyrk1A  appears  to  be  involved  in  the 
pathogenesis  of  several  neurodegenerative  diseases 
such  as  Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD),  Parkinson’s 
disease,  and  Huntington’s  disease  (HD).  For  exam-
ple,  Dyrk1A  phosphorylates  α-synuclein  and  regul-
ates  its  inclusion  formation,  and  potentially  affecting 
neuronal  cell  viability  (Kim  et  al.,  2006).  In  addition, 
up-regulation  of  Dyrk1A  in  immortalized  hippocampal 
progenitor  H19-7  cells  causes  AD-like  pathogenesis 
through  the  formation  of  tau  inclusion  and  the 
generation  of  β-amyloid 
fragment  (Park  et  al., 
2007).  However,  the  exact  role  of  Dyrk1A  and  its 
signal  transduction  leading  to  cell  death  is  not 
clearly  elucidated  yet.

Apoptosis  signal-regulating  kinase  1  (ASK1),  a 
member  of  the  mitogen-activated  protein  kinase 
kinase  kinase  family,  is  composed  of  an  inhibitory 
N-terminal  domain,  a  kinase  domain,  and  a  C- 
terminal  regulatory  domain  (Ichijo  et  al.,  1997).  ASK1 
can  promote  apoptosis  in  response  to  common 
pro-apoptotic  stresses,  such  as  oxidative  stress 
(Song  et  al.,  2002),  death  receptor  ligands  (Nishitoh 
et  al.,  1998),  and  endoplasmic  reticulum  stress 
(Nishitoh  et  al.,  2002).  ASK1  also  phosphorylates 
and  activates  both  p38  and  JNK  pathways  (Ichijo  et 
al.,  1997).  The  mechanism  of  ASK1  activation  is 
positively  regulated  by  its  binding  proteins  such  as 
TNF  receptor-ssociated  factors  2/6  (Noguchi  et  al., 
2005)  and  Daxx  (Chang  et  al.,  1998).  On  the  other 
hand,  several  cellular  proteins,  including  thioredoxin 
(Saitoh  et  al.,  1998),  Hsp90  (Zhang  et  al.,  2005), 
and  14-3-3  (Zhang  et  al.,  1999),  have  been  reported 
to  interact  with  ASK1  and  inhibit  ASK1  activity.

In  the  present  study,  we  investigated  whether  and 
how  Dyrk1A  becomes  activated  during  cell  death. 
We  found  that  Dyrk1A  is  linked  to  JNK  signaling 
pathway  and  acts  as  the  upstream  kinase  of  JNK. 
Additionally,  Dyrk1A  interacts  with  and  positively 
regulates  ASK1  under  various  cell  death  conditions. 

finding  suggest 

These 
that  Dyrk1A  plays  an 
important  role  in  ASK1-mediated  transmission  of 
cell  death  signals.

Cell  culture  and  preparation  of  cell  lysates

    Human  embryonic  kidney  293  (HEK293)  cells 
were  maintained  in  DMEM  containing  10%  FBS  and 
100  unit/ml  penicillin-streptomycin.  The  cells  were 
transfected  with  various  expression  vectors  using 

to 

LipofectAMINE  PLUS  reagent,  according 
the 
manufacturer’s  protocols.  In  order  to  prepare  cell 
lysates,  the  cells  were  rinsed  twice  with  ice-cold 
phosphate-buffered  saline,  and  then  solubilized  in 
lysis  buffer  (50  mM  Tris,  pH  7.5,  containing  1.0% 
Nonidet  P-40,  150  mM  NaCl,  10%  glycerol,  1  mM 
Na3VO4,  1  μg/ml  leupeptin,  1  μg/ml  aprotinin,  1  mM 
EGTA,  1  mM  EDTA,10  mM  NaF,  and  0.2  mM  phenyl-
methylsulfonyl  fluoride).  The  cells  were  scraped, 
and  the  supernatants  were  collected  after  centri-
fugation  for  20  min  at  14,000xg  at  4oC.

Immunoprecipitation  and  immunoblot  assay

    One  microgram  of  suitable  antibodies  was  incu-
bated  with  0.5  to  1  mg  of  cell  extracts  prepared  in 
cell  lysis  buffer  overnight  at  4oC.  Fifty  microliter  of  a 
1：1  suspension  of  Protein  A-Sepharose  beads 
was  added  and  incubated  for  2  h  at  4oC  with  gentle 
rotation.  After  beads  were  pelleted  and  washed 
extensively  with cell lysis  buffer,  the  immunocomplexes 
were  dissociated  by  boiling  in  SDS-PAGE  sample 
buffer,  separated  onto  SDS-PAGE  gel,  and  transferred 
to  a  nitrocellulose  membrane  (Millipore,  Japan). 
Membranes  were  then  blocked  in  TBST  buffer  (20 
mM  Tris,  pH  7.5,  137  mM  NaCl,  and  0.1%  Tween 
20)  plus  5%  nonfat  dry  milk  for  1  h  at  room  tem-
perature,  and  incubated  overnight  at  4oC  in  TBST 
buffer  with  3%  nonfat  dry  milk  and  the  appropriate 
primary  antibodies.  Membranes  were  washed  three 
times  in  TBST,  and  then  incubated  with  appropriate 
secondary  IgG-coupled  horseradish  peroxidase  anti-
bodies  for  1  h  at  room  temperature.  The  membranes 
were  washed  three  times  with  TBST  and  visualized 
with  ECL  reagent.

In  vitro  kinase  assay

    After  cells  were  harvested  and  lysed  in  lysis 
buffer,  the  protein  extracts  (∼500  μg)  were  incu-
bated  with  appropriate  antibody  for  overnight  at 
4oC.  The  immunocomplexes  were  mixed  with  protein 
A-Sepharose  beads,  and  washed  three  times  in 
lysis  buffer.  For  JNK  assay,  the  kinase  reaction  was 
carried  out  at  30oC  for  30  min  in  20  μl  of  kinase 
buffer  (25  mM  HEPES,  pH  7.4,  25  mM  glycero-
phosphate,  25  mM  MgCl2,  100  μM  sodium  ortho-
vanadate)  containing  10  μM  ATP,  5  μCi  of  [γ- 
32P]  ATP,  and  5  μg  GST-c-Jun  as  a  substrate.  For 
Dyrk1A  kinase  assay, 
immunocomplexes  were

resuspended  in  the  kinase  reaction  buffer  (20  mM 
Tris-HCl,  pH  7.5,  20  mM  MgCl2)  containing  10  μM 
ATP,  5  μCi  [γ-32P]ATP,  and  incubated  for  15  min 
at  30oC  in  the  presence  of  5  μg  of  GST-ASK1  as 
a  substrate.  The  reactions  were  stopped  by  adding 
SDS-sample  buffer,  and  analyzed  by  SDS-PAGE 
followed  by  autoradiography.

RESULTS

Dyrk1A  becomes  activated  by  toxic  stimuli, 
such  as  TNFα and  hydrogen  peroxide

    In  a  previous  report  we  have  shown  that  the 
addition  of  etoposide  to  embryonic  hippocampal 
H19-7  cells  causes  the  activation  of  Dyrk1A,  which 
facilitates  the  interaction  between  Hip-1  and  cas-
pase-3  and  then  leads  to  the  cell  death  (Kang  et 
al.,  2005).  In  addition  to  etoposide,  we  firstly  exa-
mined  whether  Dyrk1A  becomes  activated  upon  the 
stimulation  with  other  toxic  stimuli,  such  as  tumor 
necrosis  factor-α  (TNFα)  and  hydrogen  peroxide 
(H2O2).  After  HEK293  cells  were  incubated  with 
hydrogen  peroxide  or  TNFα,  cell  lysates  were 
subjected  to  immunoprecipitation  with  anti-Dyrk1A, 
followed  by  immunoblotting  with  anti-phosphotyrosine. 
As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  the  auto-phosphorylation  of 
Dyrk1A  was  significantly  increased  upon  the  expo-
sure  to  these  two  stimuli,  reaching  the  maximum 
value  of  Dyrk1A  activity  at  2  hr  and  sustained 
thereafter  until  4  hr  of  post-stimuli  treatment.  The 
quantification 
bands 
revealed  a  14.92-  and  1.81-fold  increase  of  Dyrk1A 
activity  in  response  to  TNFα and  H2O2,  respectively 
(Fig.  1).  These  results  suggest  that  Dyrk1A  becomes 
activated  in  response  to  toxic  stimuli.

TNFα (100  ng/ml;  A)  or  H2O2  (1  mM;  B)  for  the  indicated  times. 
Cell  lysates  were  subjected  to  immunoprecipitation  with  anti- 
Dyrk1A,  and  the  levels  of  Dyrk1A  and  active  Dyrk1A  were 
analyzed  by  immunoblot  using  anti-Dyrk1A  or  anti-phosphotyro-
sine  IgGs.

Fig.  2A,  while  the  addition  of  etoposide  caused  JNK 
activation,  transfection  of  wild  type  Dyrk1A  led  to  a 
synergistic  increase  in  the  level  of  phospho-JNK  in 
a  dose-dependent  manner.  To  further  check  whether 
Dyrk1A  causes  the  JNK  activation,  in  vitro  kinase 
assay  was  performed.  HEK293  cells  were  transfected 
a  plasmid  encoding  either  Xpress-tagged  wild  type 
Dyrk1A  (Xpress-Dyrk1A)  or  its  kinase-deficient  mutant 
(Xpress-Dyrk1A-K188R),  or  HA-tagged  kinase-defective 
SEK1,  the  upstream  activator  of  JNK  (HA-SEK 
mutant),  and/or  pre-incubated  with  JNK  inhibitor 
SP600125  for  24  hr.  The  cells  were  then  left  un- 
stimulated  or  treated  with  etoposide  for  1  hr,  and 
the  total  cell  lysates  were  immunoprecipitated  with 
anti-JNK  followed  by  in  vitro  kinase  assay  by  using 
bacterial  recombinant  c-Jun  fused  to  GST  as  a 
substrate.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2B,  the  phosphorylation 
of  GST-c-Jun  was  enhanced  upon  the  stimulation 
with  etoposide.  Furthermore, 
the  expression  of 
Dyrk1A  resulted  in  an  enhancement  of  phosphorylated 
c-Jun  levels,  compared  with  the  cells  stimulated  by 
etoposide  alone  (Fig.  2B).  Meanwhile,  marked  re-

either  mock-transfected  or  transfected  with  Xpress-Dyrk1A  in  a 
dose-dependent  manner  for  24  hr,  as  indicated.  Then  the  cells 
were  stimulated  with  etoposide  (50  μM)  for  1  hr,  and  cell  lysates 
were  subjected  to  immunoblot  with  anti-Xpress,  anti-phosphoJNK, 
and  anti-JNK  IgGs.  (B)  Where  indicated,  HEK293  cells  were 
transfected  for  24  h  with  a  plasmid  encoding  Xpress-tagged  wild 
type  Dyrk1A  (Xpress-Dyrk1A-WT)  or  kinase-defective  K188R 
mutant  (Xpress-Dyrk1A-KD),  or  HA-tagged  kinase-inactive  SEK 
mutant.  Then,  the  cells  were  preincubated  with  SP600125  (20  μM) 
for  24  hr,  and  treated  with  etoposide  (50  μM)  for  1  hr,  as 
indicated.  After  cells  were 
immunoprecipitated  with  anti-JNK 
antibodies,  the  JNK  activity  of  immunocomplexes  was  examined 
by  in  vitro  kinase  assay  using  GST-c-Jun  as  a  substrate.  To 
check 
lysates  were 
immunoblotted  with  anti-Xpress  or  anti-HA  antibodies.

the  proper  expression  of  plasmid,  cell 

duction  of  phospho-c-Jun  levels  was  observed  under 
the  inhibition  of  Dyrk1A  arising  from  the  transfection 
of  kinase-deficient  Dyrk1A  mutant.  These  results 
suggest  that  Dyrk1A  activates  JNK  signaling  path-
way.  This  finding  was  further  supported  by  the 
observation  that  the  levels  of  phospho-c-Jun  were 
decreased  by  JNK  inhibitor  (SP600125)  or  kinase- 
deficient  SEK  mutant  type  (Fig.  2B),  which  is  pre-
sent  upstream  component  of  apoptotic  JNK  path-
way.

Dyrk1A  binds  to  ASK1,  which  is  enhanced  by 
toxic  stimuli

    To  further  characterize  how  Dyrk1A  is  linked  to 
JNK  pathway,  we  examined  the  possibility  that 
Dyrk1A  directly  interacts  with  JNK.  After  HEK293 

Functional  Link  between  Dyrk1A  and  ASK1 39

cells  were  transfected  with  Xpress-Dyrk1A  or/and 
Flag-JNK  alone  or  together,  cell  lysates  were  immu-
noprecipitated  with  anti-Flag  followed  by  immuno-
blotting  with  anti-Xpress.  As  shown  in  Fig.  3,  the 
anti-Flag-JNK  immunoprecipitates  did  not  include 
Xpress-tagged  Dyrk1A,  suggesting 
that  Dyrk1A 
does  not  bind  with  JNK  directly,  whereas  it  is 
related  to  JNK  signaling  pathway.
      Like  as  other  MAP  kinase  family  member,  ERK 
and  p38,  JNK-mediated  signaling  pathway  consists 
of  three  components,  such  as  upstream  MAP3K 
(ASK1),  MAP2K  (MKK4/7  or  SEK1),  and  JNK/SAPK, 
(JNK1  and  JNK2)  (Kanamoto  et  al.,  2000).  Next  we 
examined  whether  Dyrk1A 
interacts  with  ASK1. 
After  HEK293  cells  were  transfected  with  HA-ASK1 

Fig.  3.  Dyrk1A  does  not  interact  with  ASK1.  After  HEK293  cells 
were  transfected  for  24  hr  with  Xpress-Dyrk1A  or/and  Flag-JNK, 
cell  lysates  were  subjected  to  immunoprecipitation  with  anti-Flag, 
followed  by  immunoblot  with  anti-Xpress  or  anti-Flag  IgGs.  As  a 
control,  cell  lysates  were  also  immunoblotted  with  anti-Xpress 
and  anti-Flag  antiserum.

subjected  to  immunoprecipitation  with  anti-HA,  and  then  immunoblot  assay  was  performed  with  anti-Xpress  or  anti-HA  antibodies.  To 
examine  the  proper  expression  of  plasmid,  cell  lysates  were  immunoblotted  with  anti-HA  and  anti-Xpress  IgGs.  (B)  After  HEK293  cells 
were  transfected  for  24  h  with  Flag-ASK1  alone  or  together  with  either  Xpress-tagged  wild  type  (WT)  or  kinase-defective  Dyrk1A  (KD), 
cell  lysates  were  subjected  to  immunoprecipitation  with  anti-Flag,  followed  by  immunoblot  assay  with  anti-Xpress  antibodies.  The  proper 
expression  of  plasmid  was  examined  by  immunoblot  assay  with  anti-Xpress  or  anti-Flag  antibodies.  (C)  HEK293  cell  lysates  were 
subjected  to  immunoprecipitation  with  mouse  anti-Dyrk1A  or  preimmune  mouse  anti-IgG,  followed  by  immunoblot  with  anti-ASK1  IgG.  The 
cell  lysates  were  also  immunoprecipitated  with  mouse  anti-ASK1  or  preimmune  mouse  anti-IgG,  followed  by  the  immunoblot  with 
anti-Dyrk1A  antiserum.  The  levels  of  endogenous  proteins  were  measured  by  immunoblotting  with  anti-Dyrk1A  and  anti-ASK1  antibodies, 
as  indicated.  (D)  Where  indicated,  HEK293  cells  were  treated  with  H2O2  (1  mM),  TNFα (100  ng/ml),  or  etoposide  (100  μM)  for  30  min. 
Cell  lysates  were  subjected  to  immunoprecipitation  with  anti-ASK1,  and  then  immunoblot  assay  was  performed  by  using  anti-Dyrk1A  or 
anti-ASK1  antiserum.

blotted  with  anti-Xpress.  As  shown  in  Fig.  4A,  when 
the  cells  were  co-transfected  with  Dyrk1A  and 
ASK1,  Dyrk1A  binds  to  ASK1.  We  further  investigated 
whether  the  kinase  activity  of  Dyrk1A  is  necessary 
for  its  binding  to  ASK1.  As  shown  in  Fig.  4B, 
HEK293  cells  were 
transfected  with  a  plasmid 
encoding  either  Xpress-tagged  wild  type  or  kinase- 
defective  Dyrk1A  alone  or  together  with  Flag-ASK1. 
Co-immunoprecipitation  assay  revealed  that  ASK1 
interacts  with  kinase-deficient  Dyrk1A  as  well  as 
with  wild  type  (Fig.  4B).  These  data  suggest  that 
the  kinase  activity  of  Dyrk1A  appears  not  to  be 
required  for  the  interaction  between  Dyrk1A  and 
ASK1.
    Next  we  examined  whether  the  mutual  interaction 
between  endogenous  Dyrk1A  and  endogenous 
ASK1  still  occurs.  After  HEK293  cell  lysates  were 
immunoprecipitated  with  mouse  anti-Dyrk1A,  followed 
by  immunoblotting  with  anti-ASK1  and  anti-Dyrk1A, 
Dyrk1A  well  interacts  with  ASK1  endogenously  (Fig. 
4C).  Immunoprecipitation  of  the  same  lysates  with 
mouse  monoclonal  anti-ASK1  antibody  with  followed 
by  immunoblotting  with  anti-Dyrk1A  in  a  reverse 
order  produced  the  same  binding  band  (Fig.  4C). 
As  a  control,  the  immunoprecipitation  with  mouse 
preimmune  anti-IgG  produced  no  band  with  anti- 
Dyrk1A  or  anti-ASK1,  confirming  the  validity  of  assay 
(Fig.  4C).  This  data  confirms  that  the  mutual  inter-
action  between  ASK1  and  Dyrk1A  is  not  an  artifact 
arising  from  the  DNA  transfection,  and  still  occurs 
inside  cells.
interaction  between 
    To  examine  whether 
Dyrk1A  and  ASK1  is  being  affected  by  toxic  stimuli, 
including  H2O2,  TNFα,  or  etoposide,  HEK293  cells 
were  incubated  with  each  stimuli  for  1  hr.  When  cell 
lysates  were  immunoprecipitated  with  anti-ASK1, 
followed  by  immunoblotting  with  anti-Dyrk1A,  the 
binding  of  Dyrk1A  to  ASK1  was  significantly  increased 
by  the  exposure  with  these  toxic  stimuli  (Fig.  4D). 
While 
the  most 
remarkable  increased  binding  of  Dyrk1A  to  ASK1, 
H2O2  and  etoposide  had 
less  effect  (Fig.  4D). 
These  results  suggest  that  toxic  stimuli  facilitate 
interaction  between  Dyrk1A  and  ASK1.

immunoprecipitated  with  anti-Dyrk1A,  followed  by 
immunoblotting  with  anti-phosphotyrosine.  As  shown 
in  Fig.  6A,  the  exposure  of  TNFα caused  the  acti-
vation  of  Dyrk1A  as  well  as  JNK,  and  the  presence 
of  kinase-defective  ASK1  resulted  in  the  significant 
reduction  of  JNK  activity,  suggesting  that  ASK1  is 
present  upstream  of  JNK.  Unlike  to  JNK,  the  levels 
of  phospho-Dyrk1A  levels  were  not  changed  re-
markably  by  kinase-inactive  ASK1,  compared  to  the 
cells  in  the  absence  of  ASK1  mutants  (Fig.  6A). 
When  the  same  experiments  were  performed  under 
the  condition  of  H2O2-  and  etoposide-induced  cell 
death,  the  similar  activation  pattern  of  JNK  and 
Dyrk1A  was  observed  in  HEK293  cells,  whereas 
these  two  stimuli  caused  much  less  activation  of 
Dyrk1A  than  TNFα  (Fig.  6A).  However,  the  pre-
sence  of  kinase-defective  ASK1  did  not  affect  the 
activation  of  Dyrk1A  induced  by  H2O2  and  etopo-
side  (Fig.  6A).  Taken  together,  these  results  suggest 
that  ASK1  does  not  affect  Dyrk1A  activity.
    We  next  examined  whether  Dyrk1A  acts  as  an 
upstream  regulator  of  ASK1-JNK  signaling.  After 
HEK293  cells  were  co-transfected  with  HA-ASK1 
alone  or 
together  with  kinase-defective  Xpress- 
Dyrk1A-K188R,  the  activation  pattern  of  ASK1  and 
JNK  under  the  condition  of  toxin-induced  cell  death 
was  determined  by  immunoblot  assay  with  anti- 
phospho  ASK1  and  anti-phospho  JNK.  As  shown 
Fig.  6B,  when  the  cells  were  co-transfected  with 
ASK1  plus  kinase-defective  Dyrk1A,  the  activation 
of  ASK1  and  JNK  was  significantly  inhibited  by  TNF
α,  H2O2,  and  etoposide,  compared  with  the  cells 
transfected  with  ASK1  alone.  These  data  indicated 
that  Dyrk1A  as  a  upstream  regulator  positively 
modulates  ASK1-JNK  signaling  during  toxin-induced 
cell  death.
    To  examine  Dyrk1A  directly  phosphorylates  ASK1, 
in  vitro  kinase  assay  was  performed.  After  trans-
fected  with  a  plasmid  encoding  Xpress-Dyrk1A  for 
24  h,  HEK293  cells  were  stimulated  with  eto-
poside.  Then,  cell  lysates  were  immunoprecipitated 
with  anti-Xpress  antiserum,  followed  by  in  vitro 
kinase  assay  by  using  bacterial 
recombinant 
ASK1750-1013  or  ASK11014-1374  fragment  fused  to  GST 
as  a  substrate.  As  shown  in  Fig.  7,  both  of  these 
two  ASK1  fragments  were  well  phosphorylated  by 
Dyrk1A.  These  results  suggest  that  Dyrk1A  directly 
phosphorylates  the  C-terminal  domain  of  ASK1.

Where 
indicated,  HEK293  cells  were  mock-transfected  or 
transfected  for  24  hr  with  HA-tagged  kinase-defective  ASK1. 
Then,  the  cells  were  left  un-stimulated  or  treated  with  TNFα
(100  ng/ml),  H2O2  (1  mM),  or  etoposide  (100  μM)  for  1  hr.  After 
cell  lysates  were  immunoprecipitated  with  anti-Dyrk1A,  the  levels 
of  Dyrk1A  and  active  Dyrk1A  in  the  immunocomplexes  were 
analyzed  by  immunoblot  with  anti-Dyrk1A  and  anti-phosphotyrosine 
antiserum.  Toxin-induced  JNK  activation  and  the  proper  expre-
ssion  of  HA-ASK1  were  examined  by  immunoblotting  of  cell 
lysates  with  anti-HA,  anti-phosphoJNK,  or  anti-JNK  antibodies. 
(B)  After  HEK293  cells  were  mock-transfected  or  transfected  with

etoposide  (100  μM)  for  1  hr,  as  indicated.  The  activation  of  ASK1 
was  examined  by  immunoblot  assay  using  anti-phospho  ASK1 
(Thr-845).  The  levels  of  HA-ASK1,  JNK,  and  active  JNK  in  cell 
lysates  were  also  immunoblotted  with  anti-Xpress,  anti-JNK,  or 
anti-phosphoJNK  antibodies,  respectively.

    Based  on  the  finding  that  Dyrk1A  is  linked  to  JNK 
signaling  pathway  and  interacts  with  ASK1,  we  next 
examined  how  Dyrk1A  is  linked  to  ASK1  and/or 
JNK  signaling  cascades.  To  firstly  determine  whether 
the  activation  of  Dyrk1A  is  mediated  by  ASK1,

DISCUSSION

    Dyrk1A  activity  is  involved  in  cell  proliferation  and 
differentiation  (Dierssen  and  de  Lagran,  2006).  For 
example,  while  Ras-dependent  signaling  is  required 
for  promoting  or  maintaining  neuronal  differentiation, 
Dyrk1A  modulates  ERK  activation  by  interacting 
with  Ras,  B-Raf,  and  MEK1  and  by  facilitating  the 
formation  of  a  Ras/B-Raf/MEK1  multi-protein  complex 
(Kelly  and  Rahmani,  2005).  Recently,  many  studies 
implicated  a  potential  role  of  Dyrk1A  during  cell 
death.  For  example,  Dyrk1A  caused  the  formation 
of  abnormal  protein  aggregates  through  the  phos-
phorylation  of  α-synuclein,  APP,  and  tau  (Kim  et 
al.,  2006;  Park  et  al.,  2007;  Ryoo  et  al.,  2008). 
Furthermore,  these  cells  show  a  marked  increase  of 
apoptotic  cell  death  (Park  et  al.,  2007),  indicating 
that  the  overexpression  of  Dyrk1A  induces  cell 
death.  Moreover,  Dyrk1A  seems  to  participate  in 
the  pathogenesis  of  Huntington  disease  by  modula-
ting  the  interaction  of  toxic  huntingtin  and  Hip-1  in 
hiipocampal  neuronal  cells  (Kang  et  al.,  2005). 
However,  the  functional  role  of  Dyrk1A  during  cell 
death  and  its  signal  transduction  pathway  have  not 
been  elucidated  yet.  Presently,  we  demonstrated 
that  the  activation  of  Dyrk1A  occurs  during  toxin- 
including  TNFα,  hydrogen 
induced  cell  death, 
peroxide,  and  etoposide.  In  addition,  while  the  acti-
vation  of  Dyrk1A  is  linked  to  and  positively  stimu-
lates  JNK-signaling,  Dyrk1A  did  not  directly  bind  to 
JNK.

    Pro-apoptotic  ASK1  mediates  the  induction  of 
apoptosis  under  the  stimulation  of  diverse  stress 
through  the  activation  of  JNK  signaling  pathway. 
This  hypothesis  was  confirmed  by  the  current  find-
ing.  We  demonstrated 
that  Dyrk1A  physically 
interacts  with  ASK1  and  enhances  ASK1  and  acts 
as  a  positive  regulator  of  ASK1.  Moreover,  Dyrk1A 
appears  to  directly  phosphorylate  the  C-terminal 
domain  of  ASK1.  Similar  to  Dyrk1A,  several  pro-
teins  were  reported  to  positively  regulate  ASK1 
activity.  For  example,  TRAF  family  and  Gemin5 
promoted  the  homo-oligomerization  of  ASK1  (Nishitoh 
et  al.,  1998;  Kim  et  al.,  2007),  and  CaMKII  induces 
the  phosphorylation  of  ASK1  in  Ca2＋-influx  condi-
tion  (Takeda  et  al.,  2004).  Further  study  is  required 
how  Dyrk1A  positively  regulates  ASK1.

localization  signal  and  13  histidine  repeat  for  nuclear 
speckle  targeting,  Dyrk1A  has  been  detected  in  the 
soma  and  dendrites  of  neurons.  Therefore,  it  is  not 
surprising  that  Dyrk1A  substrates  comprise  both 
nuclear  and  cytosolic  proteins,  including  transcrip-
tional  factors  (CREB,  NFAT,  STAT3,  FKHR,  Gli1),

the  current  finding  demonstrates  that  Dyrk1A  inter-
acts  with  and  phosphorylates  other  cytosolic  protein 
kinase,  ASK1.
    Although  Dyrk1A  is  linked  to  JNK  signal  trans-
duction  pathway  during  cell  death,  the  direct  effect 
of  Dyrk1A  on  cell  viability  or  cell  death/  survival  was 
not  assessed  yet.  The  current  finding  that  Dyrk1A 
enhances  the  activities  of  ASK1  and  JNK1,  it  could 
act  as  a  pro-apoptotic  player.  This  speculation  was 
further  supported  by 
the  previous  reports.  For 
example,  the  activation  of  Dyrk1A  has  been  reported 
in  several  neurodegenerative  diseases,  such  as  DS 
and  AD.  For  example,  Ts65Dn  mouse,  a  well-

known  mouse  model  of  DS  with  abnormal  1.5-fold 
accumulation  of  Dyrk1A,  exhibits  hippocampal  hypo-
cellularity  in  early  development  and  adult  (Lorenzi 
and  Reeves,  2006),  and  increased  mitochondrial 
superoxide 
level  (Schuchmann  and  Heinemann, 
2000).  Besides,  the  susceptibility  of  cell  death  has 
been  increased  in  various  types  of  cells  from  DS 
patients  (Busciglio  and  Yankner,  1995;  Roat  et  al., 
2007).  Furthermore,  the  cells  overexpressing  Dyrk1A 
exhibited  abnormal  processing  of  several  AD-related 
pathogenic  proteins  (Park  et  al.,  2007).  Like  to 
Dyrk1A,  ASK1  activity  also  contributes  to  the  cell 
death  in  the  neurodegenerative  diseases,  including 
AD  and  HD.  The  accumulation  of 
intracellular 
aggregates  induced  cellular  stress,  which  subse-
quently  leads  to  neuronal  cell  death  in  an  ASK1- 
dependent  manner  in  HD  (Nishitoh  et  al.,  2002). 
ROS-induced  activation  of  ASK1  is  also  a  key 
mechanism  for  β-amyloid-induced  neurotoxicity  in 
AD  (Hashimoto  et  al.,  2003;  Kadowaki  et  al.,  2005). 
Based  on 
it  would  be 
interesting  to  examine  whether  and  how  Dyrk1A 
leads  to  cell  death  through  ASK1-JNK  signal  trans-
duction.
    In  conclusion,  the  current  study  demonstrated  that 
Dyrk1A  positively 
regulates  ASK1-JNK  activation 
during  toxin-induced  cell  death.
