Actin is one of the most abundant

proteins in eukaryote cells, which
forms a double stranded filament. The
actin filament is not only a main com-
ponent of the cytoskeleton, but also acts
as a motor protein which moves toward
one specific end, the barbed end, driven
by polymerization at the barbed end and
depolymerization at the other end, the
pointed end, without any associated
proteins. This motor activity is referred
to as “treadmilling” and it represents the
simplest motor system known, consisting
of only one 42 kDa protein, actin. Here
we report the minimum requirements of
the actin-like motor system elucidated
by computer simulations: (1) Nucleotide
binding and ATPase activity in the
(2) Polarity in the rates of
filament;
polymerization
depolymerization
between the two ends; and (3) The
dependence of the subunit-subunit inter-
actions on the bound nucleotide. These
requirements are simple and this know-
ledge should facilitate the development
of artificial molecular motor systems in
the future.

Actin is one of the most abundant proteins
in eukaryote cells, which forms a double
stranded filament.1 The actin filament is
involved in various kinds of cellular func-
tions, including cell adhesion, cell moti-
lity, cell division, cytoskeletal arrangement
and muscle contraction. In most cases, the
actin filament is dynamic through depoly-
merization and polymerization at both
ends.2,3 The actin dynamics in lamellipo-
dia and filopodia is typical. Actin filaments
move toward one specific end, the barbed
end, by polymerization at this end and
depolymerization at the other end, the

pointed end. This process leads to the
outward expansion of the cell membrane.
It is widely known that the actin fila-
ment with ATP, in vitro, moves toward
the barbed end without any other pro-
teins by polymerization at the barbed end
and depolymerization at the pointed end.
The polymerization and depolymerization
processes occur at the same rate when the
steady-state is reached and the movement
is referred to as “treadmilling.” Therefore,
actin acts as a motor system. It is the
simplest motor system known, because
the actin motor system consists of only
the 42 kDa protein actin. The mechan-
isms of molecular motors are not fully
understood, although many motors have
been identified, including myosins, kine-
sins, dyneins and F1-ATPase. Therefore,
knowing the minimum requirements of
the actin-like motor system may help us
to understand not only actin-like motors
but also many other motors. We have
already reported that a combination of
simple parameters reproduce the unidirec-
tional movement of treadmilling.4 How-
ever, this simple set of parameters does
not represent the minimum requirements
of treadmilling, because the system is still
too complex.

The actin-like treadmilling motor sys-
tem requires three elements. First, ATP
hydrolysis occurs within the filament and
the exchange of the bound nucleotide in
the filament is negligible. Second, polarity
in the rates of polymerization and depoly-
merization exist between the two ends,
that is, both rates of polymerization and
depolymerization at the fast end (corres-
ponding to the barbed end in the actin
filament) are substantially higher
than
those at the slow end (corresponding to
the pointed end in the actin filament). In

hydrolysis and phosphate release tend
to occur at the less dynamic slow end
before the next monomer is incorporated,
whereas ATP-monomer molecules poly-
merize rapidly at the fast end. Therefore,
the fast end is predominantly in the ATP-
state, whereas
the slow end contains
primarily the ADP-state. Here the critical
concentration, which is equivalent to the
ratio of the depolymerization rate to the
polymerization rate, is the same at both
ends when the bound nucleotide is the
same.5,6 Third, the critical concentration
of the monomer with ATP is lower than
that with ADP. This results in a lower

ATPase rate in the filament and corre-

are the critical concentrations of the mole-
cules with ATP and ADP, respectively,
where CT , CD, and these two parameters
represent the third element. kFT and kFD
are the polymerization rates at the fast
end. The depolymerization rates at the

calculated as kFTCT and kFDCD, respect-
ively. Conversely, kST = rkFT and kSD =

constants for polymerization with ATP

The results of the simulation based on
realistic parameters determined by direct
measurements7 are presented in Figure 2A
and C. The filament moves toward the
fast end at a constant velocity, indicating
that the three elements were sufficient to
reproduce the unidirectional movement.
The speed of the movement can clearly
be changed by altering the parameters.
For example, when the critical concentra-
tion of
the monomers with ADP was
increased by nine-fold, the rate also increa-
sed by ~7-fold (Fig. 2B, D and G), indi-
cating the depolymerization with ADP at
the slow end was rate-limiting when the
realistic parameters were used (Fig. 2A
and C).

To elucidate the importance of

the
three elements, further simulations were
performed. When there was no ATPase
activity, kATPase = 0, the filament did not

Figure 1. A simplified model for a treadmilling motor system. The thickness of the arrows at each end of the filament is proportional to the
polymerization and depolymerization rates which are used in the simulation with the realistic parameters (Fig. 2A). In our model, we start with the
filament consisting of ATP subunits (the first panel). As time passes, the slow end tends to have ADP subunits because of the ATPase in the filament and
the polarity in the dynamics. At the steady-state (the latter two panels), the filament of the actin-like treadmilling motor moves toward the fast end
without changing its length by polymerization at the fast end and depolymerization at the slow end.

single filament of the actin-like treadmilling motor, with the slow end to the left. On the horizontal line, each dot represents a subunit with ATP or ADP in

was chosen so that the average length of the actin filament remained constant. The time interval of the simulation was 0.005 sec. The filament moves
toward the fast end at a constant velocity. (B) The time course of the simulation with the same parameters as (A) except for CD = 18 mM. The filament

represent the results with the same parameters as (A), (B) and (E), respectively. “No polarity” represents the result with the same parameters as (A) except
for r = 1, there was no polarity in the dynamics. “CT = CD” represents the result with the same parameters as (A) except for CD = 0.1 mM, the same as CT.

move (Fig. 2E–G),
indicating that
the
first element was
indispensable. When
the polymerization and the depolymeriza-
tion rates were identical at both ends,
r = 1, the filament did not move either
(Fig. 2G), indicating the second element
was essential to the unidirectional move-
ment. The third element was also essential
because when the critical concentration
was independent of the nucleotide species,
CT = CD, the filaments did not move.
Therefore, the three elements represent

the minimum requirements to reproduce
the treadmilling movement.
The structural basis of

the second
element has been characterized. We deter-
mined the three-dimensional structure of
the actin pointed end by cryo-electron
microscopy and single-particle analysis8
and the resultant structure showed that a
specific loop to loop interaction at the
pointed end is the basis of the slower
dynamics at the pointed end than at the
barbed end.4 The requirements for the

polarity in the dynamics is reviewed by
Narita, 2011.6 There are two simple
requirements. The double
(or more)
stranded form of the filament and one
specific interaction at the slow end were
essential.

Unfortunately, the structural basis of
the first and the third elements remain
unresolved. Three models of
the actin
filament determined by X-ray fiber dif-
fraction1 and electron microscopy9,10 have
been published, the first was with Ca2+ and

and the third with Mg2+ and ADPPi.10
However, the mechanisms of the ATPase
in the filament and the affinity change
between the subunits according to the
bound nucleotide species are not well
understood. This is because of a lack of
resolution in each structure, and due to
the absence of a structure when ATP is

bound. To understand the ATPase mech-
anism and the small affinity change (~20
fold) within the structure requires a clear
understanding of the side-chain conforma-
tions, which could not be seen in any of
the three models. For a full understand-
ing of the actin motor system, the actin
filament structures at higher resolution
with ADP, ADPPi and ATP are required.

Nonetheless, the computer simulation
has shown that the three elements repres-
ent the minimum requirements to repro-
duce the treadmilling one-way movement
(Fig. 2). The requirements are simple and
relatively easy to achieve using an artificial
motor system. This knowledge may facili-
tate the development of artificial molecular
motor systems in the future.
