The objective of this study was to determine shifts in the microbial community structure
and potential function based on standard Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) storage
procedures for sediment cores. Standard long-term storage protocols maintain sediment
temperature at 4˚C for mineralogy, geochemical, and/or geotechnical analysis whereas
standard microbiological sampling immediately preserves sediments at −80˚C. Storage at
4˚C does not take into account populations may remain active over geologic time scales
at temperatures similar to storage conditions. Identiﬁcation of active populations within
the stored core would suggest geochemical and geophysical conditions within the core
change over time. To test this potential, the metabolically active fraction of the total micro-
bial community was characterized from IODP Expedition 325 Great Barrier Reef sediment
cores prior to and following a 3-month storage period. Total RNA was extracted from com-
plementary 2, 20, and 40 m below sea ﬂoor sediment samples, reverse transcribed to
complementary DNA and then sequenced using 454 FLX sequencing technology, yield-
ing over 14,800 sequences from the six samples. Interestingly, 97.3% of the sequences
detected were associated with lineages that changed in detection frequency during the
storage period including key biogeochemically relevant lineages associated with nitrogen,
iron, and sulfur cycling. These lineages have the potential to permanently alter the physical
and chemical characteristics of the sediment promoting misleading conclusions about the
in situ biogeochemical environment. In addition, the detection of new lineages after stor-
age increases the potential for a wider range of viable lineages within the subsurface that
may be underestimated during standard community characterizations.

INTRODUCTION
The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) and its prede-
cessor programs Deep Sea Drilling Program and Ocean Drilling
Program have led scientiﬁc drilling of the marine subsurface for
over 40 years. Three main repositories [Gulf Coast Repository,
Bremen Core Repository (BCR), and Kochi Core Repository] col-
lect and store drill material from around the world, providing a
resource to land based scientists in an effort to expand the research
potential of the Program. The main focus of subsurface research
has been chemical and physical characterizations. However, recent
initiatives have emphasized the importance of understanding the
subseaﬂoor biosphere (Bickle et al., 2011). With this new direction
has come new technology and awareness to determine the biolog-
ical effects on subsurface. Previous studies have described some
aspects of the physical, chemical, and biological effects of long-
term storage on core integrity (König et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2010),
however a detailed analysis of changes in the active microbial
community during core material storage has not been presented.
Advancements in drilling technology and expeditions dedicated
to microbiology have provided an increase in the number of sam-
ples suitable for enhanced microbial community characterization.
Resulting studies have produced a better understanding of in situ

community structure and further described natural diagenetic
processes deep beneath the seaﬂoor. Multiple biological processes
catalyzed by subsurface microbial populations have been shown to
alter the physical and chemical structure of subsurface sediment
and rock (reviewed in Fry et al., 2008). With minimal geochemical
alteration in subsurface environmental conditions over short time
scales (Jørgensen, 2011) the community structure would remain
stable in composition and expressed metabolic processes. There-
fore, disruptions to in situ ﬂuid ﬂow, temperature, or pressure, such
as those created during the drilling process and subsequent core
storage would be hypothesized to create shifts in both community
structure and overall function. This newly structured population
would utilize different chemical compounds at different rates com-
pared to the undisturbed population and thus would change the
physical and chemical composition of the stored material. Key to
this assumption is the availability of a dormant fraction of the
population, or a minor fraction that becomes more metabolically
active following a disruption event. Dormancy is a valuable and
common trait to microbial populations (Jones and Lennon, 2010)
but has been more frequently associated with environments that
experience periodic perturbations or shifts in environmental con-
ditions (Fuhrman et al., 2006; Jones and McMahon, 2009). Lin

Microbial shifts during sample storage

et al. (2010) suggested the presence of potential dormant popu-
lations in subsurface sediments by describing a shift in microbial
community structure within stored IODP sediment samples. The
next step is to determine a shift in metabolically active populations
during storage to better describe both the microbial community
and associated functional processes threatening core integrity.

This study provides a detailed examination and comparison of
the metabolically active fraction of the microbial population at
the time of sample recovery, representing near in situ conditions,
and active microbial populations detected after 3 months of stan-
dard core storage. Total community 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
transcripts were sequenced from multiple sediment depths col-
lected during IODP Expedition 325 on the Great Barrier Reef.
High throughput sequencing using 454 FLX provided the sequenc-
ing capacity to statistically determine shifts in the population
over time. This work supports and advances a previous study by
Lin et al. (2010) by providing unique insight into the metaboli-
cally active microbial populations that would be contributing to
alterations in physical and chemical properties of sediment cores
during storage. These alterations should be considered during
post-expedition sediment analysis. This study also demonstrates
that minor and/or dormant lineages can be revived when envi-
ronmental conditions change, providing evidence for a viable
fraction of the community. A viable fraction would represent
a sink for genetic material and metabolic processes potentially
underestimated in current biosphere characterizations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLING ACQUISITION AND STORAGE
Sediment samples were collected during the IODP Expedi-
tion 325 aboard the mission speciﬁc platform Greatship Maya.
Drilling occurred April 5th, 2010, at Noggin Pass (17˚6.3461
S,
(cid:2)
146˚33.7526
E) drill hole M0058A using the advance piston cor-
ing (APC) drilling system. Immediately following recovery, whole
round core sections were cut from the drill core liner at three
depths below surface at 2, 20, and 40 m below sea ﬂoor (mbsf).
For the purposes of this manuscript, the samples collected onboard
the Greatship Maya are identiﬁed as “offshore samples” within this
manuscript. These samples were transferred to −80˚C freezer and
shipped on dry ice to the Mills Laboratory after the completion of
the expedition. The remaining core material was then maintained
at 4˚C during transit, shipping, and storage at the BCR in Bre-
men, Germany. During expedition onshore activities at the BCR,
sediment was collected July 13, 2010 from the same core sections
sampled offshore, at locations directly adjacent to the whole round
core sections. A 2-cm wide sediment section was collected from
the center of the core, homogenized, and frozen at −80˚C prior
to being shipped on dry ice to the Mills Laboratory. The samples
stored at 4˚C prior to sub-sampling at the BCR are identiﬁed as
“onshore samples” within this manuscript.

GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSES
Sediment interstitial water was collected shipboard using Rhi-
zon syringes for geochemical analysis. Samples designated for
onshore analysis at BCR were preserved immediately upon col-
lection by refrigerated acidiﬁed (cations) or by frozen unacidiﬁed

shipboard using a gas stripping technique described in Hall and
Aller (1992). Porewater anions (e.g., SO2−
,) were mea-
sured onshore using ion chromatography at BCR and cations (e.g.,
Fe, Mn, Ca, S) were measured onshore using inductively coupled
plasma–optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES) at BCR. Total
carbon (TC) and total organic carbon (TOC) was analyzed on
50 mg dried sediment taken every 50 cm using a LECO CC-125
carbon–sulfur analyzer onshore at BCR.

NUCLEIC ACID EXTRACTION AND RNA PURIFICATION
Nucleic acids were extracted from both offshore and onshore sam-
pled sediments using a method modiﬁed from Mills et al. (2008).
The description below provides details not previously published
and represents the most updated version of this versatile extrac-
tion method. Key to the method was reducing time spent during
the extraction process with extraction yields being inversely pro-
portional to duration of extraction procedure. All chemicals were
molecular biology grade (MBG) where available. All water for
solutions was autoclaved and treated with diethylpyrocarbonate
(DEPC) to remove nucleases. A 0.5-g sample was quickly chipped
from frozen sediment under sterile conditions and placed into
a 2-ml screw top tube with rubber gasket in lid. All samples
remained frozen prior to extraction. Between 100 and 250 μl of
extraction buffer [250 μl of 1 M Tris–HCl (MP Biomedicals; Solon,
OH, USA; pH 8.0), 200 μl of 500 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid (EDTA; EMD Chemicals; Gibbstown, NJ, USA; pH 8.0), and
230 μl of 40% glucose (Calbiochem; La Jolla, CA, USA) raised
to a total 10 ml volume with sterile deionized water] was added
to each sample tube. The ﬁnal concentration of the extraction
buffer is as follows: 25 mM Tris–HCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.92%
glucose. Volume added of the extraction buffer was determined
by the amount of porewater in sample and should be adjusted
accordingly. Sufﬁcient volume of buffer added is achieved when
the sample can be adequately vortexed; forming a soft, well-mixed
mud. Samples were cycled ﬁve times through a 45-s vortex, frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and thawed for 1 min at 55˚C. Samples were
rapidly and completely thawed during 55˚C incubation, but tem-
peratures remained low to avoid increasing activity of DNases
and RNases. After ﬁve cycles were completed, the following solu-
tions were added: 0–150 μl extraction buffer (total volume of
extraction buffer added equaled 250 μl between this and the pre-
vious addition steps), 100 μl lysozyme solution [extraction buffer
−1 lysozyme (Rockland, Inc.; Gilbertsville, PA, USA)
with 4 mg ml
added], and 50 μl of 500 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). Samples were incu-
bated for 10 min at 30˚C while shaking at 150 rpm. A solution
of phenol (EMD Chemicals; Gibbstown, NJ, USA):chloroform
(BDH; West Chester, PA, USA):isoamyl alcohol (MP Biomedicals;
Solon, OH, USA, 25:24:1) was added at 800 μl along with 50 μl of
10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; EMD Chemicals; Gibbstown,
NJ, USA). Phenol was not buffered with Tris hydrochloric acid so
that the pH remained acidic. Acidic phenol is optimal for RNA
extraction. Samples were vortexed for 1 min to create an emulsion
prior to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (21,100× g ) for 3 min at
room temperature. The top aqueous layer was transferred to a new
2 ml screw top tube containing 800 μl phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol. Samples were again vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged
for 3 min at 15,000 rpm (21,100× g ) at room temperature. The

aqueous layer was transferred to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge
tube avoiding any traces of the phenol solution. A total of 50 μl
of 3 M sodium acetate (J. T. Baker; Phillipsburg, NJ, USA; pH 6.4)
and 1 ml 200 proof MPG ethanol was added to each sample prior
to a 15-min centrifuge step at 15,000 rpm (21,100× g ) at 4˚C. The
supernatant was slowly removed and the pellet dried for 10 min.
Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of sodium citrate (pH 6.4) to
optimize for RNA preservation. If DNA is desired, resuspend in
autoclaved, deionized water (pH 8.0), and buffer the phenol to
raise the pH to 8. For RNA sample preparation, extractions were
treated with Turbo DNA Free (Ambion, Inc.; Austin, TX, USA)
according to manufacturer’s instructions to remove residual DNA
co-extracted with the RNA.

RNA REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION
Small subunit (SSU) rRNA was reverse transcribed according to
Reese et al. (2012). In brief, complementary DNA (cDNA) was
produced using moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse
(cid:2)
transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and 518R (5

cDNA that spanned three hyper-variable regions (V1 through V3;
Handl et al., 2011). cDNA amplicons from each of the sediment
samples were sequenced at the Research and Testing Laboratory
(Lubbock, TX, USA). Amplicons from each sample were ﬁrst
labeled with a 10 base unique multiplex identiﬁer (MID) sequence
to allow all samples to be sequenced on a single run of a Roche
454 FLX (454 Life Sciences; Branford, CT, USA). Downstream
sequence analysis parsed the individual sequences into sample spe-
ciﬁc libraries. Resulting libraries were screened for reads less than
200 bases, reads lacking a Roche-designed four base key sequence,
and non-bacterial reads lacking speciﬁc 28F primer recognition
site. Sequences were checked for chimeras using the black box
chimera check software (B2C2; Gontcharova et al., 2010). All
sequences passing quality control were denoized prior to phy-
logenetic and statistical analysis. Sequences were then deposited
to the National Center for Biotechnology Information database
using Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number
SRA049351.

PHYLOGENETIC AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All sequences passing quality control were taxonomically classi-
ﬁed (percent of total sequence length that aligned with a given
database sequence) using the NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search
Tool (BLASTn) .NET algorithm (accessed January 2011; Dowd
et al., 2005). Sequences with identity scores greater than 97% iden-
tity (<3% divergence) to known or well characterized 16S rRNA
sequences were resolved at the species level, between 95 and 97% at

the genus level, between 90 and 95% at the family, and between 85
and 90% at the order level, 80 and 85% at the class and 77–80% at
phyla (Stackebrandt and Goebel, 1994). Only sequences meeting
the genus taxonomic classiﬁcation were incorporated into statisti-
cal analyses. Predictions of functional diversity were derived from
genus level taxonomic characterization using previous studies for
reference. Lineages with multiple metabolic functions identiﬁed
were assigned to multiple groups to reduce effects of limited geo-
chemical data. The percentage of sequences identiﬁed to individual
lineages was determined for each sample providing relative abun-
dance information within and among the samples based upon
reads per sample. Sequences were further clustered into oper-
ational taxonomic units (OTU) using the Ribosome Database
Project (RDP; University of Michigan; Lansing, MI, USA) using
a 95% sequence similarity cutoff (corresponding to a genus level
classiﬁcation). The sequences were not trimmed prior to cluster-
ing to avoid potential biases for or against indel regions common
to 16S rRNA. The authors recognize potential problems with this
decision; however, using a lower sequence similarity cutoff (95%
compared to a typical 97%) produced a reproducible calculation
of OTUs with multiple clustering runs. Chao1, Shannon Wiener,
and Evenness were calculated from the OTU clustering using RDP.

RESULTS
GEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION
Cations, anions, and TOC were measured onshore at BCR whereas
ammonia and alkalinity were measured shipboard. Alkalinity, pH,
and chloride concentrations were unchanged with depth into the
sediment. Concentrations of ammonia increased from 0.1 mM
near the sediment surface to 2.2 mM at 40 m depth (Figure 1).
Conversely, sulfate concentrations decreased from 29 mM at the
surface to 18 mM at depth. Iron concentrations were low in the
top 5 m (1 μM) and increased sharply at 9 m (14 μM) followed by
a decrease in concentration until 25 m (0.7 μM). Another sharp
increase in iron concentration was observed at 29 m (11.7 μM) and
at 36 m (10.9 μM). Manganese followed the same general trend as
iron with spikes in concentration at the same depths. Manganese
was highest in the surface (0.6 μM) and lowest at 34 m (0.1 μM).
Total carbon was 8.7 wt% on average in hole M0058A. Within
the TC, TOC comprised 3% and total inorganic carbon (TIC;
carbonates) was 97%. The TOC in M0058A averaged 0.3 wt%
throughout the sediment column.

PHYLOGENETIC DISTRIBUTION OF BACTERIAL LINEAGES
All samples collect onboard the Greatship Maya and immediately
stored at −80˚C are referred to as “offshore” samples. This sam-
pling strategy is commonly considered indicative of an in situ
population characterization. Samples collected at the BCR follow-
ing 3 months of storage at 4˚C prior to being cryogenically frozen
are referred to as “onshore” samples.

A total of 14,897 16S rRNA cDNA sequences passed quality
control from the two sets of 2, 20, and 40 mbsf sediment samples.
Twelve phyla representing 71 families were identiﬁed. Sequences
derived from offshore samples contained a total of 38 families,
while the onshore samples had 54 families. This increased diver-
sity following 3 months storage was also observed in Chao1 and
Shannon Wiener calculations (Table 1). With the exception of

Microbial shifts during sample storage

the 20-mbsf sample collected during post-cruise operations, the
evenness increased during storage. Changes in trends in sequence
abundance per lineage were observed between the offshore and
onshore samples (Figure 2). A majority of the samples had more
than 99% of the total sequences represented by lineages that shifted
in frequency of detection between sampling time points. Twenty
families represented less than 1.0% of the total sequences and were
omitted from this analysis. These 20 families accounted for 4.0%
of the total sequences from the 2-m sample collected after storage,
whereas they incorporated less than 0.8% of the total sequences
for four of the other ﬁve samples.

MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE – OFFSHORE SAMPLES
A total of 40 families were detected from samples immediately
frozen shipboard at −80˚C. A subset of 19 families (83.4% of the
offshore sequences) was more frequently detected at all depths

iron and total manganese (B).

compared to the samples collected during the onshore portion
of Expedition 325 (Table 2). These families represented 94.5%
at 2 mbsf, 87.5% at 20 mbsf, and 68.2% at 40 mbsf of the in situ
sequences detected. In contrast, these families represented only
4.3, 14.8, and 23.8%, respectively, of the total sequences obtained
from the corresponding depths in the onshore sediment samples.
Of the 19 families detected in the 2-mbsf offshore sediment
samples, Lachnospiraceae (24.5%), Ruminococcaceae (17.0%),
Clostridiaceae (10.1%), Lactobacillaceae (9.3%), Enterococcaceae
(8.1%), and Xanthomonadaceae (7.8%) were detected the most
frequently (Table 2). These lineages collectively only represented
2.8% of the sequences obtained from the 2-mbsf sediments col-
lected during on shore sampling. Functional classiﬁcation suggest
over 66% of these sequences were associated with lineages capable
fermentative processes (Figure 3). Aerobic lineages com-
of
prised 5.2% of the sequences while groups capable of carbonate
dissolution represented 17.0%.

A total of 19 families were detected at 20 mbsf depth. Although
the number of families detected was similar to the 19 families
at 2 mbsf sample, a population shift was observed at 20 mbsf
with no Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiaceae, Enterococcaceae, and
Xanthomonadaceae detected (Table 2). Lactobacillaceae and
Ruminococcaceae increased in abundance to represent 35.2 and
27.2% of the sequences obtained from this depth, respectively.
Ruminococcaceae was not detected in the sediments after the
storage period at 4˚C. Similarly, Pseudomonadaceae represented
10.9% of the total sequences at this depth, but only 0.7% after
the 3-month storage. Lactobacillaceae was detected at 13.6% of
the total sequences obtained from the 20-mbsf sediment stored
at 4˚C. Rhizobiaceae (6.1%) and Enterobacteriaceae (5.5%) were
also detected at greater than 5% abundance of total sequences
(Table 2). Similar to the 2-mbsf sample, fermentative lineages
were the most frequently detected (68.5% of total sequences;
Figure 3). Aerobic lineages were again 5.0% of the sequences how-
ever groups capable of carbonate dissolution represented 27.2%
of the total sequences. Nitrate reducing lineages increased in
frequency detected (16.1% of the total sequences).

At 40 mbsf, 19 families were identiﬁed. Both Lactobacil-
laceae and Ruminococcaceae decreased in abundance (20.1 and
13.6%, respectively) compared to the 20-mbsf sample (Table 2).
Other lineages detected at 40 mbsf included Microbacteriaceae
(10.6%), Comamonadaceae (9.3%), Enterobacteriaceae (8.9%),
Sphingomonadaceae (7.1%), and Corynebacteriaceae (7.0%). A

Microbial shifts during sample storage

frequently detected with 45.7% of the sequences attributed to this
group (Figure 3). While fermentative lineages were also detected
after the 3-months, the frequency decreased over 50% compared to
the offshore samples. Nitrate, iron, and sulfate-reducing lineages
represented 4.1, 10.2, and 6.4%, respectively. In contrast to the off-
shore 2 mbsf sample, carbonate reducing lineages accounted for
only 1.1% of the sequences.

A total of 20 families were detected in the 20 mbsf sediment
samples collected during the onshore portion of the Expedition
(Table 2). Within this set, 23.3% of the total sequences were rep-
resented by 10 families that were more abundant in the stored
sediments at all depths compared to the offshore samples. An
additional 62.5% of the sequences from this sample were related to
Comamonadaceae (44.3%), Microbacteriaceae (8.6%), and Enter-
obacteriaceae (8.6%; Table 2). Sequences related to Comamon-
adaceae increased in abundance by an order of magnitude between
the offshore sampling (4.5%) and the post-cruise sampling period
at 20 mbsf (44.3%). However, this lineage was not included in the
initial percent calculations due to the abundance decreasing at
40 mbsf from 9.3 to 0.3% after 3 months at 4˚C. A similar trend
was determined for Microbacteriaceae with an increase at 20 mbsf
from 0.2 to 8.6% during the 3-month period at 4˚C, whereas in
samples at 40 mbsf the abundance decreased from 10.6 to 0.0%.
The 20 mbsf sample was the only depth where Enterobacteriaceae
was more frequently detected in onshore sampled sediment (8.6%)
compared to the offshore sampled sediment (4.3%). Collectively,
the 10 families plus Comamonadaceae, Microbacteriaceae, and
Enterobacteriaceae equal 84.9% of the sequences from the 20-m
sample collected onshore, compared to 11.6% of the sequences
from the corresponding offshore sample. Additional families
detected frequently at 20 mbsf included Clostridia (7.3%), Oscil-
latoriales (3.7%), and Propionibacteriaceae (3.6%). In contrast to
the 2-mbsf sediments, Halomonadaceae, Clostridia, Flavobacte-
riaceae, Geobacteraceae, Carnobactericeae, Oceanospirillales, and
Desulfobulbaceae were not detected as this depth. Nitrate reduc-
ing lineages incorporated 45.0% of the total sequences while
fermenters remained constant with depth (Figure 3).

At 40 mbsf, sequence annotation identiﬁed 29 total families
within the sediments. A subset of 14 families represented 71.6%
of the total sequences at this depth (Table 2). These families
included Halomonadaceae (27.9%), Altermonadaceae (11.2%),
Piscirickettsiaceae (7.7%), Flavobacteriaceae (6.2%), Streptococ-
caceae (4.6%), and Solirubrobacteraceae (4.3%). Only Streptococ-
caceae was also detected (1.8%) in the offshore samples. Although
Lactobacillaceae (10.3%) and Enterobacteriaceae (4.6%) were
detected frequently in the onshore samples, they were two times
less that the number of sequences detected in sediments preserved
on the ship. Aerobic lineages represented 44.6% of the sequences
detected while fermenters accounted for 21.4% (Figure 3). Lin-
eages associated with methylotrophs incorporated 7.8% of the
total sequences while carbonate dissolution groups represented
3.4% of the sequences, the most at any depth in the onshore
samples.

DISCUSSION
This study describes a shift in population structure within sed-
iment core material obtained from borehole M00058A during

Sequences were annotated using RDP Classiﬁer. Identiﬁcation was
determined with a conﬁdence interval of 70%. Sequence data supports a

storage.

general trend of increasing abundance with depth was noted with
all of these lineages. In addition, these lineages were detected over
three times more frequently in the offshore samples compared to
the onshore samples. A similar distribution of functional process
was observed compared to the 20-m sample with the exception of
no aerobic lineages detected (Figure 3).

MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE – ONSHORE SAMPLES
A total of 57 families were detected in the three samples collected
during the onshore portion of Expedition 325 following 3 months
of storage at 4˚C (Table 2). There were 24 families with a higher
sequence abundance (62.1% of the total sequences) at all three
depths following the 3-month storage at 4˚C (?? in Appendix)
compared to the samples collected and preserved at −80˚C on
the ship. These families accounted for 91.4% at 2 mbsf, 23.3% at

contrast, the same 24 families represented only 0.2, 1.4, and 2.3%
of the sequences obtained from 2, 20, and 40 mbsf, respectively,
from sediments stored immediately at −80˚C.

At 2 mbsf, a total of 33 families were detected with 20 fam-
ilies representing 90.3% of the sequences (Table 2). The most
frequently detected lineages included Halomonadaceae (24.2%),
Clostridia (19.7%), Flavobacteriaceae (12.2%), Geobacteraceae

IODP Expedition 325 to the Great Barrier Reef following 3 months
storage at 4˚C. These data indicate subsurface microbial popula-
tions remain metabolically active under these conditions and are
thus capable of altering sediment geochemistry during storage.
Unique to this analysis is the use of RNA-based targets to deter-
mine the metabolically active fraction of the total population. The
concentration of ribosomes, and thus copies of SSU rRNA within
a cell, is linearly correlated to cellular metabolic activity (Delong
et al., 1989; Kerkhof and Ward, 1993; Lee and Kemp, 1994),
with dormant and dead cells having few to no ribosomes present
(Fegatella et al., 1998). The active population both responds to and
changes the geochemistry in the environment. Therefore, charac-
terizing this population provided a proxy for identifying potential

shifts in the geochemistry and assessment of the integrity of the
core. In addition, a change in this population determined a frac-
tion of the population that was below detection limits or dormant
during in situ geochemical conditions, but active during storage
conditions. This viable fraction of the community represented a
source for different metabolic processes available to the commu-
nity when the environment changed and highlighted a potentially
underestimated portion of the community. Further enrichment-
based culturing has the potential to deﬁne a larger amount of
diversity and function within this and other communities.

A shift at the family taxonomic level following 3 months of
storage between the offshore and onshore sampling time points
incorporated as much as 90% of the sequence data set from the

from an IODP expedition, results describing microbial activity at
4˚C should be considered when storing any non-sterilized samples
for subsequent analysis.

SHIFTS IN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE
Metabolically active microbial populations alter their surround-
ing environments through the consumption and production of
chemical compounds. As populations shift, the consumption and
production rates change and are no longer representative of
in situ conditions. During initial characterization of the in situ
metabolically active community structure,
lineages associated
with fermentation, including Lactobacillaceae, Clostridiaceae, and
Ruminococcaceae, were detected at highest frequency compared to
other lineages (Figure 3). In total, lineages associated with fermen-
tation processes accounted for nearly 70% of the 2 and 20 mbsf
samples and over 40% for the 40-mbsf sample. The prevalence of
fermentative lineages in the shallow subsurface has been previously
noted (Tofﬁn et al., 2005), providing support for the annotation
presented. These lineages may play a signiﬁcant role in the con-
version of organic matter present in the shallow sediments (Tofﬁn
et al., 2005).

Following storage for 3 months, the number of groups associ-
ated with fermentative sequences decreased over two times. This
discrepancy may be attributed to a reduction of substrate due
to disrupted in situ ﬂuid ﬂow. As the geochemical conditions
changed, the niche advantage decreased allowing other lineages to
become more abundant. In the 2- and 40-mbsf samples, fermenta-
tion capable lineages were in part replaced by an increase in aerobic
lineages (Figure 3). While this group was detected in the offshore
samples at 2 mbsf, no aerobic lineages were detected at the 40-
mbsf sample. After the 3-months at 4˚C, 44.6% of the sequences
obtained related to aerobic organisms compared to 0.0% in the
offshore sample at the same depth. This suggests oxygen intru-
sion into the core. Oxygen can affect both the biology as well
as the chemistry of the sediments and should be avoided where
possible. Lin et al. (2010) observed sulﬁde oxidation to sulfate
when sediment cores experienced oxygen penetration. Addition-
ally, the increase in sulfate was predicted to promote a community
shift favoring sulfate-dependent methane oxidizers. While the Lin
et al. (2010) study was DNA based, this current RNA-based study
supports their conclusion as methylotrophs were detected in the
metabolically active fraction of the total populations. The deple-
tion of sulfate by these lineages may inhibit geochemical detection
of the sulﬁde oxidation process, stressing the importance of mol-
ecular analyses coupled to geochemical measurements to better
environmental characterizations. In contrast to the 40-mbsf sam-
ple, it is hypothesized that oxygen remained limiting in the sample
collected at 20 mbsf as a rise in nitrate reducers were observed. An
increase in nitrogen cycling populations, including Comamon-
adaceae, Rhodospirillaceae, and Rhodobacteraceae, would affect
ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite analysis to levels not reﬂective of
the in situ conditions. Differences between the 20- and 40-mbsf
biogeochemical proﬁles suggest variable storage affects between
core sections, adding to the unpredictability of geochemical and
microbiological results from stored sediments.

A large percentage of offshore sequence data sets were associ-
ated with lineages capable of carbonate dissolution (Figure 3).

active fraction of the population. Active microbial processes alter
both the chemical and physical composition of subsurface sed-
iments. These diagenetic processes are common and have been
well studied in situ, however the potential for alteration has been
less understood when the sediments were removed from the envi-
ronment and placed in cold storage conditions. The integrity of
core material is critical for post-expedition research and sedi-
ment curation efforts for programs like IODP. This manuscript
serves to better understand the microbial populations that are
metabolically active during sediment core storage and provide
descriptions of potential processes acting on those sediments. In
addition, increased diversity in the stored sediments compared
to in situ analysis suggests that species diversity in the subsur-
face may be underestimated. Although sediments selected here are

Microbial shifts during sample storage

This was expected given the location of the sediments being
in close proximity to the Great Barrier Reef. However, follow-
ing incubation, the frequency of detection for these groups
dropped an order of magnitude on average with the 20-mbsf
sample populations shifting from 27.2% of the total sequences
to undetectable. This shift suggests a major alteration of the
geochemical environment, requiring speciﬁc analysis to deter-
mine the cause and implications. Due to shipboard limitations,
this analysis could not be preformed and thus was beyond the
capacity of this study. These data represent the ﬁrst step to
being able to identify metabolic processes within stored sedi-
ments and provide a more clear prediction of sediment alteration
capacity.

A signiﬁcant rise in the number of sequences related to iron
and sulfate-reducing lineages was observed in the sediments
obtained onshore compared to the offshore samples. Both iron
and sulfate-reducing functional groups were only detected after
sediment storage and accounted for over 10 and 6% of the
total sequences. These populations becoming metabolically active
would affect any post-expedition analysis of sulfur and iron chem-
istry. They have the potential to reduce sulfate and Fe(III) con-
centrations in marine systems to below detection limits while
forming multiple iron sulfur mineral compounds. Secondary
effects would change the pH of the sediment and alter organic
matter content and concentration. In addition, the paleomag-
netic record within the sediments, or other material would be
altered by both iron reducing and oxidizing populations (Kostka
and Nealson, 1995; Zachara et al., 1998 reviewed in Kopp and
Kirschvink, 2008). An active microbial population would alter
multiple characterization efforts within the sediment proﬁle.
Understanding these processes and how to better reducing them
is required.

VIABLE FRACTION OF THE POPULATION – METABOLIC SINK
A community shift within a closed system implies that a portion
of the population was either metabolically active but below detec-
tion limits, or dormant in situ. The implications of these shifts
are critical for the core preservation strategies and down stream
analysis reliability, as well as, for understanding the overall viable
fraction of the subsurface biosphere. To verify a closed system, sed-
iments collected were examined for contamination resulting from
the drilling process. Results suggest that the contamination poten-
tial was very low, but the authors recognize that this possibility
cannot be fully ruled out. A general contamination during drilling
or storage would have resulted in a homogenization of the detected
community structure. Variations in the detection frequency of
multiple lineages suggest a general contamination did not occur.

Aerobic populations were detected in the 40-mbsf onshore sam-
ple. These two lineages, Alteromonadaceae and Flavobacteriaceae
were detected in the 2-mbsf sample as well, but not in the 20-mbsf
sample. The increase in abundance of related sequences suggests
oxygen intrusion into the sediment may have occurred, however
these populations can be facultatively anaerobic as well. These two
populations were not detected at 20 mbsf, reducing the potential
for this to be a drilling contamination or air borne contamina-
tion during storage. Additional testing beyond the scope of this
paper would be required to determine the true origin of this
population.

These results support a fraction of the population remaining
viable but dormant within the subsurface. The lower amount
of diversity reported in the metabolically active in situ popula-
tion (offshore sample) compared to the higher level of diversity
observed on shore supports niche diversiﬁcation during storage
and the revival of dormant populations. The coring process dis-
rupted multiple environmental factors, including resource avail-
ability, pressure, and temperature. These stressors have con-
tributed to shifts in community composition in other environ-
ments (Hunter et al., 2006; Lewis, 2007). Within these samples,
the environmental changes revived microbial populations in sed-
iments dated to over 50 kyr cal before present (Yusuke et al.,
2011). The subsurface is considered geochemically stable with
slow change over time; a characteristic that has the potential to
limit diversity (Orcutt et al., 2011) and the effectiveness of dor-
mancy as a strategy to maintain a viable population (Jones and
Lennon, 2010). However, the population characterized in these
samples potentially provided a source of functional diversity for
community activity over geologic timescales. This expands the
potential range of such survival strategies beyond environments
with periodic shifts in geochemical and geotechnical conditions
(Cohen, 1970; Fuhrman et al., 2006; Jones and Lennon, 2010), and
should be considered in estimates of community functional capac-
ity. Future studies will quantify the depth of the functional sink
available to respond to changing environments. In addition, the
length of time these dormant populations remain viable will be
determined to better understand the effect of temporal isolation.
