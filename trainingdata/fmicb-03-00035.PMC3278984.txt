Fluvial ecosystems process large quantities of dissolved organic matter as it moves from
the headwater streams to the sea. In particular, hyporheic sediments are centers of high
biogeochemical reactivity due to their elevated residence time and high microbial biomass
and activity. However, the interaction between organic matter and microbial dynamics in
the hyporheic zone remains poorly understood. We evaluated how variance in resource
chemistry affected the microbial community and its associated activity in experimentally
grown hyporheic bioﬁlms. To do this we fed beech leaf leachates that differed in chemical
composition to a series of bioreactors ﬁlled with sediment from a sub-alpine stream. Dif-
ferences in resource chemistry resulted in differences in diversity and phylogenetic origin
of microbial proteins, enzyme activity, and microbial biomass stoichiometry. Speciﬁcally,
increased lignin, phenolics, and manganese in a single leachate resulted in increased phe-
noloxidase and peroxidase activity, elevated microbial biomass carbon:nitrogen ratio, and
a greater proportion of proteins of Betaproteobacteria origin. We used this model system
to attempt to link microbial form (community composition and metaproteome) with func-
tion (enzyme activity) in order to better understand the mechanisms that link resource
heterogeneity to ecosystem function in stream ecosystems.

INTRODUCTION
Headwater streams are increasingly being recognized as biogeo-
chemical hotspots and key players in the processing of organic
matter as it proceeds toward the sea (Battin et al., 2008, 2009;
Mulholland et al., 2008; Beaulieu et al., 2010). Intimately con-
nected with the landscape, headwaters receive signiﬁcant amounts
of terrestrial organic matter, which they retain, transform, and
transport to larger downstream ecosystems (e.g., Wallace et al.,
1997; Bernhardt et al., 2003; Fisher et al., 2004; Battin et al., 2008;
Mulholland et al., 2008). It is generally recognized that most of
the processing in headwater streams occurs in the hyporheic zone,
the transition within the streambed where surface water mixes
with groundwater (GW; Valett et al., 1996; Boulton et al., 1998).
The sediments of the hyporheic zone also offer a very large surface
area for colonization by microbial bioﬁlms, the major contributors
to biogeochemical transformations in streams (Battin et al., 2003,
2008). Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of the controls on
these microbial communities is of central importance in develop-
ing a broader understanding of what constrains biogeochemistry
in stream ecosystems.

Inputs in allochthonous organic matter in the headwaters of
lotic ecosystem can vary in chemical composition due to regional
differences in ﬂora, driven by differences in geology, topogra-
phy, and climate. This in turn inﬂuences the form and func-
tion of stream microbial communities. In a large spatial survey,
differences in stream microbial community composition among

biomes were linked to chemical differences of the organic matter
entering these streams (Findlay and Sinsabaugh, 2006). In a dif-
ferent study, amendments with leaf leachates affected microbial
community respiration, enzymatic activity, and composition in
stream sediments (Findlay et al., 2003). Furthermore, experimen-
tally amending organic matter and nutrients to benthic stream
bioﬁlms has shown that resource chemistry may inﬂuence bacte-
rial communities at the phyla level (Olapade and Leff, 2005). But
few studies have explicitly related changes in complex resource
chemistry to community structure and function using the novel
molecular techniques now available to microbial ecologists.

In this study, we assess the response of hyporheic bioﬁlm
community structure and function to variations in the chemical
composition of the microbial resource pool. While there are gen-
erally large differences in chemical composition (both organic and
inorganic) between plant species (Osborne et al., 2007), there can
also be signiﬁcant differences in elemental composition within
a given species (Wanek et al., 2010). In order to better under-
stand how differences in resource chemistry affect structure and
function of hyporheic bioﬁlms we constrained the resource land-
scape by collecting a single plant species (European Beech, Fagus
sylvatica) from various regions in Austria. This allowed us to
limit the diversity of chemistry present in complex plant com-
munities and explore how more subtle variations in chemical
composition affected the structure and function of microbial
bioﬁlms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We operated 20 Plexiglass bioreactors (∼660 mL; Battin et al.,
1999) with hyporheic sediment from a third order sub-alpine
(cid:2)
stream (Steinbach, 47˚47
E, 552 m above
sea level). Bioreactors were packed equally with hyporheic sed-
iment that was sieved (2–4 mm) and maintained in the dark to
avoid growth of phototrophs. Steinbach drains a pristine catch-
ment dominated by Norway Spruce (Picea abies) and European
Beech (Fagus Sylvatica). We fed bioreactors with carbonate-rich
groundwater (GW) mixed with different beech leaf leachates
at a dilution of ∼200:1 to simulate upwelling of shallow GW
mixed with terrigenous resource supply. As is typical for high-
gradient and karst streams, Steinbach has pronounced hydro-
dynamic exchange between sub-surface water and stream water.
Bioreactors were operated for 94 days in a once-through ﬂow mode
−1 using peristaltic pumps (Ecoline VC
at a rate of ∼110 mL h
MS/CA2, ISMATEC). Average hydrologic residence times were
approximately 4 h for all bioreactors and did not differ signiﬁ-
cantly between treatments as determined from conservative tracer
injections (Uranin AP, 45350, Merck).

To test the effect of resource chemistry on the sediment micro-
bial community composition and function, we amended GW
with leachates from beech leaves that differed in their organic
and inorganic chemistry. Substantial loads of terrigenous dis-
solved organic carbon (DOC) entering the stream via shallow
subsurface ﬂow paths have been shown to subsidize hyporheic
microbial metabolism in our study catchment (Battin et al., 1999).
To simulate this, leachates were made from beech leaves col-
lected from multiple locations within Austria [Schottenwald (SW):
(cid:2)
48˚14
E, 370 m above sea level, Klausen-Leopoldsdorf
(KL): 48˚07
E, 510 m above sea level, and Ossiach (OS):
(cid:2)
46˚40
E, 889 m above sea level]. Dried leaves (see Wanek
et al., 2010 for collection and leaf processing details) were ground
to a similar particle size and then extracted in MilliQ-water for ∼
24 h at 4˚C. After centrifugation and ﬁltration (Whatman GF/F
and 0.22 μm Millipore stericup ﬁlter cups), leaf extracts were
−1.
diluted with MilliQ-water to a concentration of 500 mg C L
Leachate concentrate was further diluted online with untreated
GW in 1 L glass bottles (Schott), continuously stirred with a mag-
−1.
netic mixing bar to a ﬁnal input concentration of ∼2 mg C L
Although we did not measure the pH of the leachate directly,
the substantial dilution with carbonate-rich GW ensured that the
inﬂuence of leachate pH on media fed to the bioreactors was neg-
ligible. Five replicate bioreactors were assigned for each of three
treatments (OS, SW, and KL) and ﬁve additional bioreactors served
as a control treatment and were fed untreated GW. Input DOC
−1. At the
concentration in the GW treatment averaged 0.7 mg C L
end of the experiment, bioreactors were sacriﬁced and sediment
from each bioreactor was equally partitioned into an inﬂow, mid-
dle, and outﬂow section (each ∼1/3 of the total bioreactor volume)
and preserved (−80˚C) for further processing and analyses.

ANALYSIS OF RESOURCE CHEMISTRY
To evaluate the resource pool, we determined the elemental and
organic chemistry of each leachate before dilution with GW. DOC
was analyzed using a Sievers TOC analyzer (GE, Boulder, CO,
USA). Inorganic nutrients (P–PO4, N–NO3, N–NO2, N–NH4)

were determined using a ﬂow-through autoanalyzer (SYSTEA
Analytical Technologies, Anagni, Italy) and metal concentrations
were determined using ICP-MS. Differences in organic chemistry
between leachates were determined by Curie-point-pyrolysis–
GC/MS using a GSG Pyromat (GSG Mess und Analysegeräte,
Bruchsal, Germany) coupled to a Thermo Trace GC and a DSQ
MS detector (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Organic material was pyrolyzed
at 590˚C and pyrolysates separated on a carbowax column (Supel-
cowax 10, Sigma-Aldrich) with a linear temperature gradient from
50 to 260˚C in 30 min. Peaks were assigned based on NiSt 05
MS library and comparison with reference material measured.
Pyrolysis products were assigned to their substances of origin
by comparison to reference material and structural similarity in
accordance with Schellekens et al. (2009). In total 39 peaks were
selected for high peak area and diagnostic value. Peak areas are
reported as a fraction of total area of all integrated peaks of a
sample (Table 1).

BIOFILM ANALYSES
Enzyme Assays
For all assays, after deconstruction of the bioreactors, samples of
alliquoted sediment were sonicated gently (1 min, Branson Dig-
ital Soniﬁer 250, 13% amplitude, 1 s pulse) to detach bioﬁlms
from the sediments as described below. The slurry was placed
into triplicate microtiter well containing the respective sub-
strate and the incubation was carried out at room temperature
over 48 h with repeated measurements (Sinsabaugh et al., 1999).
Fluorometrically labeled [4-methylumbelliferone (MUF) and 7-
amino-4-methyl coumarin (AMC)] substrates were used for the
measurement of cellulase (MUF-cellobioside), chitinase (MUF-
triacetylchitotrioside), phosphatase (MUF-phosphate), and pro-
tease (leucine-AMC) at 1, 0.5, 2, and 0.5 mM concentrations,
respectively. Peroxidase and phenoloxidase activity were also mea-
sured ﬂuorometrically by adding sample and substrate [20 mM
l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanin (DOPA) in Na-acetate buffer] in a
1:1 ratio (200 μl sample+ 200 μl substrate) for phenoloxidase
activity. Peroxidase activity was measured in the same manner
as phenoloxidase, but with additional 10 μl of 0.3% H2O2 added
10 min prior to addition of DOPA as a substrate (Sinsabaugh et al.,
1999).

Elemental analysis of microbial biomass
To analyze elemental content of the microbial communities, a
known volume of sediment was mixed with MilliQ-water (mil-
lipore; 15 mL) in sterile centrifuge tubes (BD Falcon). Samples
were thoroughly vortexed (10 s) and sonicated (1 min, Bran-
son Digital Soniﬁer 250, 13% amplitude, 1 s pulse, e.g., Battin
et al., 2003). After sonication the supernatant was decanted,
the sediment rinsed twice with MilliQ-water (total 10 mL), and
decanted again. The supernatant containing the microbial bio-
mass was frozen (−80˚C) and lyophilized. Between 1.5 and 5 mg
of lyophilized biomass (including mineral particles) was weighed
into Eppendorf tubes and treated with HCl (10% w/v, p.a.) to
remove inorganic carbon. Samples were dried (60˚C, 48 h), re-
suspended in MilliQ-water, transferred into tin capsules (Lüdi
AG, cat. no. 184.9927.26) and dried again (60˚C, 48 h). Carbon
and nitrogen content were determined using an elemental analyzer

The mean relative abundance (SD) of three replicate preparations of each leachate are listed in the column denoted with the corresponding treatment initials (SW, OS,
or KL). Each product was assigned a precursor category labeled “origin.” The mean relative abundance of each product was tested to see if treatment signiﬁcantly
affected its relative abundance using a standard analysis of variance (ANOVA).The p-value for the ANOVA is reported in the column labeled p. In addition, we conducted
Tukey HSD pair-wise comparisons to look if differences between mean values were signiﬁcant between treatments. Superscript letters indicate groups of values that
were signiﬁcantly different (p < 0.05).

(EA1110, CE Instruments ThermoFisher), and phosphorus con-
tent was determined using the persulfate digestion method (Eaton
et al., 2005).

Microbial community analysis
To assess relative differences between the most abundant taxa
among treatments terminal-restriction fragment length poly-
morphism (T-RFLP) ﬁngerprinting was conducted on all three

sections of each bioreactor. In addition, in order to evaluate dif-
ferences in total microbial diversity between treatments, for a
subset of the samples (inﬂow section from three replicates of
each of the four treatments), we analyzed the community 16S
rRNA genes with 454 pyrosequencing. For both analyses DNA
was extracted from sediments using a Power Soil DNA extraction
Kit (MoBIO, cat no. 12888-100; Besemer et al., 2009). For T-
RFLP we used the hexachloroﬂuorescein-labeled bacteria-speciﬁc

;
Eiler and Bertilsson, 2007). The 16S rRNA gene was ampliﬁed
using an initial denaturation step of 94˚C for 3 min, followed by
30 cycles of denaturation at 94˚C (40 s), annealing at 55˚C (40 s),
and extension at 72˚C (1 min). After PCR, amplicons were cleaned
using the PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen cat no. #28106; Moes-
eneder et al., 1999) and were digested with the restriction enzyme
Hha1 (Besemer et al., 2009). T-RFLP proﬁles were produced by
running the samples on a 3130 XL sequencer (Applied Biosystems)
using the default settings for fragment analysis with 50 cm capillary
length and POP7 gel matrix (Applied Biosystems). Size standards
(MM-1000-ROX, BioVentures Inc.) and operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) were assigned using a freeware designed for T-RFLP
analysis in the computing environment R (Jones and McMahon,
2009).

For 454 pyrosequencing, we ampliﬁed the V4 and V5 regions
of bacterial 16S rRNA genes using the fusion primers adaptor
A-MID-515F (GTG NCA GCM GCC GCG GTA A) and adap-
tor B-926R (CCG YCA ATT YMT TTR AGT TT; Quince et al.,
2011) containing the GS FLX Titanium sequencing adapters and
in case of the forward primer a sample speciﬁc 8 bp multiplex
identiﬁer (Hamady et al., 2008). PCR was performed using Phu-
sion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes) according to the
manufacturers recommendations. Samples were ampliﬁed using a
25-cycle touchdown PCR protocol with an initial annealing tem-
perature of 62˚C decreasing 0.5˚C with every cycle. Each sample
was ampliﬁed using two different multiplex identiﬁers and each
PCR was performed in duplicate reactions to account for PCR
drift. PCR-products were cleaned with the QIAquick Gel Extrac-
tion Kit (Qiagen) and quantiﬁed using agarose gel electrophoresis
and the Low DNA Mass Ladder (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of
the barcoded PCR-products were mixed and submitted to the Cen-
tre for Genomic Research (Liverpool, UK) for pyrosequencing on
a 454 GS20 FLX Titanium platform. Pyrosequencing data were
cleaned using the software package AmpliconNoiseV1.21 follow-
ing the procedure published by Quince et al. (2011). The cleaned
reads were clustered to OTUs with a complete linkage algorithm
on a 97% sequence identity level, yielding a clean dataset of 47,267
reads constituting 1,509 OTUs. The microbial diversity of the sam-
ples was calculated from Bayesian ﬁtting of Sichel distribution
curves to the abundance distributions and as the Chao estima-
tor of richness using the Bayesian Diversity Estimation software
(Quince et al., 2008). The sequence data have been submitted
to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under accession number
SRX099855.

Metaproteome analysis
Total proteins from the inﬂow section of three replicate bioreactors
were extracted from ca. 40 g of sediment in 20 mL of extrac-
tion buffer [50 mM Tris, pH 7.5 (NaOH), 1% SDS]. Samples
were vortexed vigorously (2 min), sonicated (5 min) on ice, boiled
(15 min), and gently shaken (4˚C, 1 h). Samples were then cen-
trifuged (1000 g, 5 min, 4˚C) and the supernatant containing the
extracted proteins was transferred into a sterile tube. This proce-
dure was repeated on the sediment, and the supernatants pooled.
Proteins in the supernatant were concentrated and puriﬁed by

acetone precipitation (acetone: sample 5:1) overnight (−20˚C).
The resulting pellets were re-suspended in 1 mL 50 mM Tris, pH
7.5 (NaOH), 1% SDS. Equal amounts (30 μl) of re-suspended
protein pellet were separated by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970)
using 12% polyacrylamide gels. Protein lanes were cut into four
slices and gel slices were immediately subjected to in-gel tryptic
digestion (Shevchenko et al., 1996). The resulting peptide mix-
tures were analyzed on a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer
(ThermoFischer Scientiﬁc, Bremen, Germany) interfaced with a
nanoelectrospray ion source as described earlier (Schneider et al.,
2010)

We conducted protein database searches using the Mascot
Search Engine (version no. 2.2.04). The reference database con-
tained all proteins from UniRef100 (9808438 entries, down-
loaded from the European Bioinformatics Institute webpage
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniref/on January, 26th 2010) and protein
sequence information from a metagenome of microbial com-
munity of a Minnesota farm silage soil (Tringe et al., 2005;
184,374 entries, downloaded from http://img.jgi.doe.gov on Octo-
ber 15th, 2009) as well as common contaminants like keratin
and trypsin (total number of entries 9,993,117). All MS/MS
ion searches were performed as described in Schneider et al.
(2010).

To validate and quantify MS/MS-based peptide and protein
identiﬁcations we used Scaffold (version Scaffold 2.02.01, Pro-
teome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA). Peptide identiﬁcations
were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95%
probability as speciﬁed by the Peptide Prophet algorithm (Keller
et al., 2002). Protein identiﬁcations were accepted if they could be
established at greater than 90% probability and contained at least
one identiﬁed peptide. Protein probabilities were assigned by the
Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003).

Semi-quantitative analyses of protein abundances were per-
formed on the basis of the number of unique spectra that were
assigned to a protein by the Scaffold software. Finally, proteins
were assigned to functional and phylogenetic groups followed by

STATISTICAL ANALYSES
All statistical analyses were performed with the analytical software
JMP or using the software and statistical computing environment
R. Direct comparisons of values between treatments were ana-
lyzed with an ANOVA and using a post hoc Tukey HSD for direct
pair-wise comparisons as speciﬁed in the text.

RESULTS
RESOURCE CHEMISTRY
Although all leachates were made from the same plant species
we found marked differences in the chemistry (both organic and
inorganic) of the individual treatments. Most elements increased
in elemental content from KL to SW to OS, respectively (Figure 1).
However, SW was signiﬁcantly (Tukey HSD, p < 0.05) depleted in
Na and enriched in Mn relative to the other treatments. Notably
the Mn concentration in SW was at least twice as high as in the

other two leachates (Figure 1). GW, which was the base of the
resource supply, contained insigniﬁcant amounts of all elements
−
with the exception of NO
3 , which was three orders of magnitude
higher than that of the leachates and thus negated any difference in
dissolved nitrogen between treatments (Figure 1). In addition, the
leachates differed in organic compounds as determined by Curie-
point-pyrolysis–GC/MS (Table 1). Notably, the SW treatment was
signiﬁcantly enriched for three of eight lignin products, and one
of three products attributed to phenolics and lignin, relative to
the other two treatments (Table 1). When pyrolysis products were
grouped by category, SW was signiﬁcantly enriched in both lignin
and phenolics categories, while OS was signiﬁcantly enriched
in carbohydrate biomarkers and depleted in protein biomarkers
relative to the other treatments (Table 2).

leachates as determined by Tukey HSD post hoc analysis. The leachate
−
treatments were not signiﬁcantly different in NO
3 but the GW was
signiﬁcantly higher than all leachate treatments.

MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION
The bioﬁlm associated microbial communities differed in
their composition between treatments as assessed by T-RFLP
(Figure 2A). A multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) of the Jacquard
similarity index indicated that the GW, KL, and OS treatments
clustered separately from each other, with some overlap, and were
spread along the same plane in MDS space. A portion of the
within-cluster variance could be attributed to the section of the
bioreactor from which the community was derived (Figure 2A).
The SW treatment also showed differences in the community com-
position between sections of the bioreactor. However, the SW
treatment primarily varied along the primary MDS axis while
the other three treatments were spread equally along both axes
(Figure 2A). A MDS plot of a Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index
generated from 454 pyrosequencing data of the inﬂow section of
each treatment showed that the communities separated clearly
by treatment with the GW treatment being the most dissimi-
lar from the other treatments (Figure 2B). However, there were
no pronounced differences in the most abundant phylogenetic
groups between treatments (Figure 3). Generally, the Proteobacte-
ria (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-proteobacteria) constituted
a higher percentage in KL, SW, and OS compared to the GW
treatment, with the highest contribution to the SW commu-
nity. Microbial diversity calculated as the Chao estimator and the
Bayesian estimate of richness (Quince et al., 2008) was similar
between treatments (Figure 4). Thus, while there were treat-
ment level differences in the community composition as assessed
by T-RFLP and, for the inﬂow section communities, as assessed
by pyrosequencing, the microbial diversity did not differ sig-
niﬁcantly between treatments that received different leachates
(Figure 4).

BIOMASS STOICHIOMETRY AND EXTRACELLULAR ENZYME ACTIVITY
We also found signiﬁcant differences in both biomass stoichiom-
etry and enzyme activity between leachate treatments (Figures 5
and 6), but only when sections of the bioreactors were evaluated
separately. Biomass stoichiometry differed signiﬁcantly between
treatments primarily in the inﬂow section of the bioreactor
(Figure 5). SW had higher C:N but lower C:P and N:P biomass
than either KL or OS, however this difference was only signiﬁcant
(ANOVA, p = 0.001) for C:N. In addition, while the mean values
for elemental ratios were similar within each treatment between

increased along the ﬂowpath of the reactor (Figure 5). This was
most pronounced for C:N of all treatments.

other treatments we found no signiﬁcant differences in enzyme
activity between treatments in the middle section or for any of the
other enzymes we assayed (Figure 6).

METAPROTEOME
Differences in enzyme activity between treatments led us to evalu-
ate the origin of the proteins in our samples. To do so we analyzed
the metaproteome for the inﬂow section for three bioreactors from
each of the four treatments. While we did not directly identify
any proteins in the metaproteome that were related to oxidative
enzyme activity, we were able to gain insight into differences of
the active microbial communities between treatments. Speciﬁcally,
between 60 and 95% of all spectra to which a phylogenetic origin
could be assigned were contributed by bacteria with additional
spectra associated with protists or metazoans, and virtually none
from fungi or plants (Figure 7A). Further analysis of the metapro-
teome revealed differences in the total number of assigned spectra
in each treatment. While OS had the highest total spectra (891),
SW had the most unique spectra (464, Figure 7B). In addition,
while 13% of all assigned spectra were cosmopolitan (i.e., shared
by all treatments), SW shared only 12–13% additional spectra with
KL or OS while KL and OS shared ca. 40% of spectra between each
other (Figure 7B). Differences in spectra abundance and percent of
shared spectra between treatments were supported by differences

in phylogenetic assignment of spectra. While virtually all identiﬁ-
able bacterial spectra were assigned to Proteobacteria (Figure 7C).
SW treatment had signiﬁcantly more alpha and betaproteobacte-
ria spectra, and fewer gammaproteobacteria spectra than either
OS or KL (Figure 8). Comparison of the metaproteome with
the pyrosequencing data of the Proteobacteria alone showed a
clearly higher proportion of Gammaproteobacteria and a clearly
lower proportion of Alphaproteobacteria in the metaproteome
(Figure 8).

DISCUSSION
The exceptional chemical and biological diversity inherent in
aquatic ecosystems makes it challenging to understand the mech-
anisms that underlie the relationship between the two. We
attempted to limit the chemical diversity by focusing on the
extracted DOC from leaves of a single tree species. While the
system we chose to address remains reasonably complicated, we
were able to arrive at some insight into the drivers of microbial
community structure and function. In all of the treatments we
noticed shifts in community composition (T-RFLP), variance in
biomass stoichiometry, and enzyme activity along the ﬂow path of
the reactor indicative of well described patterns of resource gra-
dients that occur in hyporheic sediments (Boulton et al., 1998).
However, we focused on the pronounced differences between the

resource treatments, and in particular in SW relative to the other
treatments, to identify how resource chemistry affected microbial
community composition and function.

Speciﬁcally, we found that differences between the beech leaf
leachates led to differences in composition and activity of the
microbial community in SW relative to the other leachate treat-
ments. Notably the SW treatment signiﬁcantly differed from the
other two treatments in biomass stoichiometry, enzyme activity,

and metaproteome composition. Analysis of the resource pool
for each treatment suggested that the form and function of the
microbial community of the SW treatment was affected by sig-
niﬁcant differences in organic chemistry (i.e., elevated levels of
compounds assigned to the lignin and phenolics class) and Mn
content of the SW leachate. Furthermore, differences in commu-
nity composition of the most abundant phyla (as determined by
T-RFLP) were also most pronounced in SW relative to the other

treatments (Figure 2A), although there were no clear differences in
total microbial diversity (as indicated by the 454 pyrosequencing
data) between treatments that received leachate (Figure 4). Thus,
multiple results indicated that differences in the composition of
the SW leachate drove differences in community composition
and function of the microbial communities in the SW treatment.
This suggests a relationship between microbial form and func-
tion that was detectable at a relatively coarse level of phylogenetic
resolution. The idea that composition and function of microbial
communities may be evident at higher taxonomic levels has been
suggested previously (Phillippot et al., 2010). In the current study,
we show that these broad phylogenetic shifts in the active com-
munity (metaproteome) may be attributed to relatively few phyla
and thus suggests one approach to dealing with the exceptional
diversity of environmental microbial communities.

The SW community, compared to the other two leachate treat-
ments, had elevated peroxidase and phenoloxidase activity on the
same order of magnitude as those reported for soil ecosystems
(Figure 6; Sinsabaugh, 2010). Enzymes that express peroxidase
and phenoloxidase activity are involved in the breakdown of com-
plex organic substrates, such as lignin. Activity of both of these
families of enzymes is known to increase with increasing levels of
lignin and complex organic compounds (Sinsabaugh, 2010). Dif-
ferences in the organic composition among our leachates should
have been greatly reduced by using leachate extracted from a sin-
gle tree species. However, we found SW to be enriched in both
lignin and phenolic derivatives relative to the other two leachates
(Tables 1 and 2). These differences in organic chemistry between
treatments suggested that an increased abundance of complex
organics (i.e., organic carbon molecules enriched in aromatic moi-
eties) in the SW treatment may have stimulated phenoloxidase and
peroxidase activity of the microbial community.

Previous work on stream bioﬁlms have shown explicit links
between organic matter composition and differences in bacterial

community composition. For example, a study on bioﬁlms grown
on substrate-amended clay pots found that low molecular weight
labile carbon enriched for Gammaproteobacteria relative to Alpha
and Betaproteobacteria (Olapade and Leff, 2005). A more recent
marine study similarly showed that production of high levels
of labile dissolved organic matter also enriched for Gammapro-
teobacteria (Condon et al., 2011). In the current study the SW
treatment only showed slightly different total community compo-
sition in the T-RFLP analysis, and was not more dissimilar than
the other two leachate treatments when the more rare phyla were
considered using pyrosequencing data (Figure 2).

However, SW did stand apart from the other treatments in our
analysis of the active community as indicated by the metapro-
teome. The phylogenetic assignment of the spectra from the
metaproteome revealed shifts in the relative abundance of phyla
between treatments with SW being most distinct from the other
two treatments that received leachate (Figure 7B). Speciﬁcally,
we saw a decrease in spectra assigned to Gammaproteobacte-
ria and an increase in the Alpha- and Beta-proteobacteria in
the SW treatment (Figure 8B). While an enrichment of spectra
of Gammaproteobacteria origin in the metaproteome is consis-
tent with an increased supply of labile carbon in the KL and OS
treatments, we did not see a pronounced relative increase in the
Gammaproteobacteria sequences as determined by sequencing of
the 16S amplicon (Figure 8A). This may be due to the dynamic
nature of the ﬂow-through bioreactor system with differences in
enzyme activity being reﬂected in the structure of the active com-
munity (metaproteome) but not the total community (16S rRNA
gene).

It is also possible that differences in phenoloxidase and perox-
idase activity were stimulated by the elevated level of Mn which
was approximately two times greater in SW than the other two
treatments (Figure 1). There are a set of phenoloxidases and per-
oxidases whose activity is associated with Mn (Sinsabaugh, 2010).

Resource chemistry and stream bioﬁlms

Mn is oxidized by both phenoloxidase and peroxidase enzymes
and then reacts with the bonds in complex carbon molecules such
as lignin. In previous studies the breakdown of terrestrial organic
matter has been shown to be stimulated by Mn concentration in
leaf litter. A study of pine species from a wide range of habitats
found Mn to be the single most important factor in determining
the decomposition rates of pine litter (Berg et al., 2010). A separate
study of a more diverse litter types (i.e., pine, spruce, alder, birch)
also found that late stage decomposition was strongly correlated
−1 dry mass lit-
with a threshold Mn concentration near 2 mg Mn g
ter (Berg et al., 2007). Mn concentrations of the dry litter used to
−1
produce leachate in this study were 0.74, 1.37, and 2.15 mg Mn g
litter dry mass for OS, KL, and SW, respectively (unpublished).
Thus, at least in the dry leaf litter, Mn concentration of SW was in
the range that has been shown to have a signiﬁcant effect on carbon
processing in terrestrial decomposition studies. These differences
in Mn between treatments were maintained in the dissolved phase
with Mn concentrations in the SW being at least twice as high as
in OS or KL (Figure 1).

While the above studies used inherent variation in litter Mn
concentration as we did, other studies have more directly eval-
uated the effect of Mn concentrations on litter decomposition
and microbial activity by experimentally manipulating Mn lev-
els. Additions of Mn to beech leaf litter stimulated microbial
respiration, leading to increased CO2 production and decreased
DOC release from the remaining litter over the course of a year-
long incubation (Trum et al., 2010). In addition, Mn has also
been shown to stimulate peroxidase activity at the organismal
level. A study using a pure culture of a forest soil Basidiomycete
showed that increased Mn concentrations increased the expres-
sion of Mn peroxidase resulting in increased decomposition of
humic acids in the culture (Steffen et al., 2002). This last study
provides direct mechanistic support for Mn stimulation of micro-
bially derived enzyme activity involved in breakdown on complex
organic substrates (Steffen et al., 2002).

While in the current study fungi played a minor role, if any,
there are several bacteria known to be directly involved in the
oxidation of Mn including Leptothrix sp. and members of the
Hyphomicrobium (Nealson, 2006). Our 16S pyrosequence data
revealed four hits for Leptothrix sp. and 21 hits for Hyphomicro-
bium, however, these were distributed across the treatments and
were not overrepresented in SW compared to the other treatments.
Other known Mn oxidizers in the Aurantimonas family and Metal-
logenium group were absent from the 454 pyrosequence data and
the metaproteome.

Further analysis of

the metaproteome spectra that were
enriched in SW relative to the other treatments did not reveal
any spectra that were related to oxidases or associated with Mn
(Table 3). However, the shifts in Proteobacteria classes observed
in the metaproteome between SW and the other leachate treat-
ments could be attributed to relatively few phyla within each
class of Proteobacteria. The decrease in the SW treatment of the
Gammaproteobacteria was primarily due to the absence of spec-
tra attributed to members of the family Pseudomonadaceae and in
particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Table 3). Similarly increases
in spectra attributed to the Betaproteobacteria in SW relative to
the other treatments were due to increases in spectra attributed to

Dechloromonas aromatica and a handful of other species, while
increases in Alphaproteobacteria classes could be attributed to
increases in spectra from the family Sphingomonadaceae and
Sphingopyxis alaskensis in particular (Table 3).

While P. aeruginosa is a cosmopolitan species with diverse
metabolism, D. aromatica and S. alexensis are a noted for unique
metabolisms (Cavicchioli et al., 2003; Salinero et al., 2009), specif-
ically their ability to degrade aromatic compounds and proliferate
in oligotrophic environments, respectively. Enrichment of D. aro-
matica in the SW treatment is consistent with the higher level of
phenol and lignin in the SW treatment. In addition, an overview
of the annotated genes in the genome of each D. aromatica and
S. alaskensis showed several genes that code for functions that
required Mn and/or were involved in oxidative processes. These
included a series of Mn or Mn/Zn transporters present in D.
aromatica (e.g., ABC-type Mn/Zn transport systems, COG1121
and COG1108, and a zinc/manganese transport system substrate-
binding protein) and superoxide dismutases with a Mn co-factor
thought to be involved in oxidative stress present in the genome
of both D. aromatica and S. alaskensis [e.g., superoxide dismu-
tase, Fe–Mn family (EC:1.15.1.1)]. However, the ABC-type Mn/Zn
transport systems were also present in the P. aeruginosa genome,
while the superoxide dismutases present in both the D. aromatica
and S. alaskensis were absent in P. aeruginosa. We interpret these
results to suggest that either the increase in phenolics and lignin
and/or the additional Mn in the SW leachate stimulated activity
by D. aromatica and to a lesser extent S. alaskensis. The absence
of spectra directly related to oxidative function may be due to
the ﬂow-through nature of our experimental system and/or the
low abundance of functional proteins relative to total proteins
associated with the complete proteome of any given phyla.

While it is possible that the intermediate levels among treat-
ments of the other elements led to differences in activity and
composition of the communities, we know of no mechanism that
would explain those differences. Rather we suggest that increased
amounts of lignin, phenolics, and Mn of the SW leachate led to
differences in the community structure and function of the micro-
bial bioﬁlm communities. The elevated levels of phenoloxidase
and peroxidase activity in the leachate with higher Mn, phenolic,
and lignin contents, the evidence of stimulation of these enzymes
systems by Mn in microbial culture, and enhanced decomposi-
tion with increasing Mn levels in a wide range of litter, including
beech, all suggest a mechanistic and novel role for Mn as a control
on organic carbon dynamics in aquatic ecosystems.

While the SW treatment was clearly different in metaproteome
composition, phylogenetic origin of proteins, and activity of the
oxidative enzymes, it is not clear how those metrics were related to
the increased C:N of microbial biomass we observed in SW relative
to the other treatments. We propose two mechanisms that could
explain such a shift. Stimulation by Mn or organic chemistry could
have resulted in an up-regulation of oxidative enzyme production
in the SW treatment as was seen in the Basidiomycetes study (Stef-
fen et al., 2002). Increased enzyme production may have resulted
in increased cellular N demands to synthesize N-rich enzymes.
This would result in a decrease in biomass N and an increase in
biomass C:N relative to the other treatments. Similarly, increased
oxidative enzyme activity could have resulted in an increase in

Hall et al.

Resource chemistry and stream bioﬁlms

labile organic carbon, enriching the microbial biomass in C thus
increasing microbial C:N. With the current study it is not clear
which mechanism, if either, was responsible for the increase in
microbial C:N. Regardless, our biomass stoichiometry fell within
the range of microbial communities reported elsewhere (Cleve-
land and Liptzin, 2007; Cotner et al., 2010) and small differences
in biomass stoichiometry have been shown to result in large differ-
ence nutrient recycling (see Hall et al., 2011, Figure 3). This implies
that chemical control of biomass stoichiometry by elements other
than the limiting nutrients may result in differential nutrient recy-
cling of limiting nutrient (e.g., N) among communities accessing
distinct resource pools.

Microbial ecology of streams has received signiﬁcantly more
attention over the last years (Findlay, 2010). While benthic com-
munity composition becomes increasingly studied (e.g., Hullar
et al., 2006; Besemer et al., 2009; Vishnivetskaya et al., 2010), the
community composition of hyporheic bioﬁlms remains poorly

addressed (e.g., Feris et al., 2003). Furthermore, most of these
studies do not link microbial community structure to function,
although this has been recognized as a major area of potential
advancement of stream microbial ecology (Findlay, 2010). Our
ﬁndings on differences in resource quality inducing shifts in com-
munity structure and function of hyporheic bioﬁlms add to this
rapidly growing ﬁeld of stream microbial ecology.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The authors would like to acknowledge Gerti Steniczka and Mar-
garete Watzka, Claudia Hinterleitner, and Ieda Häemmerle for
assistance in the laboratory. Financial support came from the
Austrian Science Fund (FWF) projects START (Y420-B17) and
MICDIF (S10005-B17) to T. J. Battin. The manuscript was greatly
improved by addressing a series of speciﬁc critiques from three
reviewers and an additional comment from Claudia Michaela
Boot.
