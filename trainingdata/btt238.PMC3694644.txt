Although several methods for multi-locus mapping have been proposed, it is often unclear how to relate the detected loci to the growing knowledge about gene pathways and networks.
The few methods that take biological pathways or networks into account are either restricted to investigating a limited number of predetermined sets of loci or do not scale to genome-wide settings.
Results: We present SConES, a new efficient method to discover sets of genetic loci that are maximally associated with a phenotype while being connected in an underlying network.
Our approach is based on a minimum cut reformulation of the problem of selecting features under sparsity and connectivity constraints, which can be solved exactly and rapidly.
SConES outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in terms of runtime, scales to hundreds of thousands of genetic loci and exhibits higher power in detecting causal SNPs in simulation studies than other meth- ods.
On flowering time phenotypes and genotypes from Arabidopsis thaliana, SConES detects loci that enable accurate phenotype predic- tion and that are supported by the literature.

1 INTRODUCTION  Twin and family/pedigree studies make it possible to estimate the heritability of observed traits, that is to say the amount of their variability that can be attributed to genetic differences.
In the past few years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), in which several hundreds of thousands to millions of single nucleo- tide polymorphisms (SNPs) are assayed in up to thousands of individuals, have made it possible to identify hundreds of genetic variants associated with complex phenotypes (Zuk et al., 2012).
Unfortunately, although studies associating single SNPs with phenotypic outcomes have become standard, they often fail to explain much of the heritability of complex traits (Manolio et al., 2009).
Investigating the joint effects of multiple loci by mapping  *To whom correspondence should be addressed.
sets of genetic variants to the phenotype has the potential to help explain part of this missing heritability (Marchini et al., 2005).
Although efficient multiple linear regression approaches (Cho et al., 2010  Rakitsch et al., 2012  Wang et al., 2011) make the detection of such multivariate associations possible, they often remain limited in power and hard to interpret.
Incorporating biological knowledge into these approaches could help boosting their power and interpretability.
However, current methods are limited to predefining a reasonable number of candidate sets to investigate (Cantor et al., 2010  Fridley and Biernacka, 2011  Wu et al., 2011), for instance by relying on gene pathways.
They consequently run the risk of missing biologically relevant loci that have not been included in the candidate sets.
This risk is made even likelier by the incomplete state of our current biolo- gical knowledge.
For this reason, our goal here is to use prior knowledge in a more flexible way.
We propose to use a biological network, defined between SNPs, to guide a multi-locus mapping approach that is both efficient to compute and biologically meaningful: We aim to find a set of SNPs that (i) are maximally associated with a given phenotype and (ii) tend to be connected in a given biological network.
In addition, this set must be computed efficiently on genome-wide data.
In this article, we assume an additive model to characterize multi-locus association.
The network constraint stems from the assumption that SNPs influencing the same phenotype are biologically linked.
However, the diversity of the type of relationships that this can encompass, together with the current incompleteness of biological knowledge, makes provid- ing a network in which all the relevant connections are present unlikely.
For this reason, although we want to encourage the SNPs to form a subnetwork of the network, we also do not want to enforce that they must form a single connected compo- nent.
Finally, we stress that the method must scale to networks of hundreds of thousands or millions of nodes.
Approaches by Chuang et al.
(2007) or Li and Li (2008)  Nacu et al.
(2007) developed to analyze gene networks containing hundreds of nodes do therefore not apply.
Although our method can be applied to any network between genetic markers, we explore three special types of networks (Fig.
1):    GS network: SNPs adjacent on the genomic sequence (GS) are linked together.
In this setting, we aim at recovering sub- sequences of the genomic sequence that correlate with the phenotype.

Small examples of the three types of networks considered    GM (gene membership) network: SNPs are connected as in the sequence network described earlier in the text  in add- ition, SNPs near the same gene are linked together as well.
Usually, a SNP is considered to belong to a gene if it is either located inside said gene or within a predefined distance of this gene.
In this setting, we aim more particularly at re- covering genes that correlate with the phenotype.
GI (gene interaction) network: SNPs are connected as in the GM network described earlier in the text.
In addition, sup- posing we have a gene gene interaction network (derived, for example, from protein protein interaction data or gene expression correlations), SNPs belonging to two genes con- nected in the gene network are linked together.
In this set- ting, we aim at recovering potential pathways that explain the phenotype.
Our task is a feature selection problem in a graph-structured feature space, where the features are the SNPs, and the selection criterion should be related to their association with the pheno- type considered.
Our problem is different from subgraph selec- tion problems such as those encountered in chemoinformatics, where each object is a graph and each feature is a subgraph of its own (Tsuda, 2011).
Several approaches have already been developed for selecting graph-structured features.
A number of them (Le Saux and Bunke, 2005  Jie et al., 2012) only use the graph over the features to build the learners evaluating their relevance, but do not en- force that the selected features should follow this underlying structure.
Indeed, they can be applied to settings where the fea- tures connectivity varies across examples, whereas here, all indi- viduals share the same network.
The overlapping group Lasso (Jacob et al., 2009  Liu et al., 2012) is a sparse linear model designed to select features that belong to the union of a small number of predefined groups.
If a graph over the features is given, defining those groups as all  i172  pairs of features connected by an edge or as all linear subgraphs of a given size yields the so-called graph Lasso.
A similar approach is taken by Huang et al.
(2009): their structured sparsity penalty encourages selecting a small number of base blocks, where blocks are sets of features defined so as to match the structure of the problem.
In the case of a graph-induced structure, blocks are defined as small connected components of that graph.
As shown in Mairal and Yu (2011), the overlapping group Lasso aforementioned is a relaxation of this binary problem.
As the number of linear subgraphs or connected components of a given size grows exponentially with the number of nodes of the graph, which can reach millions in the case of whole-genome SNP data, only the edge-based version of the graph Lasso can be applied to our problem.
It is however unclear whether it is sufficient to cap- ture long-range connections between graph nodes.
Li and Li (2008) propose a network-constrained version of the Lasso that imposes the type of graph connectivity we deem de- sirable.
However, their approach has been developed with net- works of genes (rather than of SNPs) in mind and does not scale easily to the datasets we envision.
Indeed, the implementation they propose relies on a singular value decomposition of the Laplacian of the network, which is intensive to compute and cannot be stored in memory.
Chuang et al.
(2007) also searched subnetworks of protein  protein interaction networks that are maximally associated with a phenotype  however, their greedy approach requires fixing be- forehand a (necessarily small) upper-limit on the size of the sub- networks considered.
In the case of directed acyclic graphs, Mairal and Yu (2011) propose a minimum flow formulation that makes it possible to use for groups (or blocks) the set of all paths of the network.
Unfortunately, the generalization to undirected graphs with cycles, such as the SNP networks we consider, requires randomly assigning directions to edges and pruning those in cycles without any biological justification.
Although this can work reasonably well in practice (Mairal and Yu, 2011), this is akin to artificially removing more than half of the network connections without any biological justification.
In what follows, we formulate the network-guided SNP selec- tion problem as a minimum cut problem on a graph derived from the SNP network in Section 2 and evaluate the performance of our solution both in simulations and on actual Arabidopsis thaliana data in Section 3.
2 METHODS  2.1 Problem formulation Let n be the number of SNPs and m the number of individuals.
The SNP  SNP network is described by its adjacency matrix W of size n   n. A number of statistics based on covariance matrices, such as the Hilbert- Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), (Gretton et al., 2005) or the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) (Wu et al., 2011), can be used to compute a measure of dependence c 2 Rn between each single SNP and the phenotype.
Under the common assumption that the joint effect of several SNPs is additive (which corresponds to using linear ker- nels in those methods), c is such that the association between a group of SNPs and the phenotype can be quantified as the sum of the scores of the SNPs belonging to this group.
That is, given an indicator vector f 2 f0, 1gn such that, for any p 2 f1, .
.
.
, ng, fp is set to 1 if the p-th   P p¼1 cpfp ¼ c f.  n  SNP is selected and 0 otherwise, the score of the selected SNPs is given by QðfÞ ¼ We want to find the indicator vector f that maximizes QðfÞ while ensuring that the solution is made of connected components of the SNP network.
However, in general, it is difficult to find a subset of SNPs that satisfies the above two properties.
Given a positive integer k, the problem of finding a connected subgraph with k vertices that maxi- mize the sum of the weights on the vertices, which is equivalent to QðfÞ of our case, is known to be a strongly NP-complete problem (Lee and Dooly, 1996).
Therefore, this problem is often addressed based on enu- meration-based algorithms, whose runtime grows exponentially with k. To cope with this problem, we consider an approach based on a graph- regularization scheme, which allows us to drastically reduce the runtime.
2.2 Feature selection with graph regularization Rather than searching through all subgraphs of a given network, we reward the selection of adjacent features through graph regularization.
As it is also desirable for biological interpretation, and to avoid selecting large numbers of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium, that the selected sub- networks are small in size, we reward sparse solutions.
The first require- ment can be addressed by means of a smoothness regularizer on the network (Ando and Zhang, 2007  Smola and Kondor, 2003), whereas the second one can be enforced with an l0 constraint:  f  z      c   ﬄﬄ zﬄﬄ     f  Lf                  ﬄﬄ zﬄﬄ      f  0  association  connectivity  sparsity  arg max f2f0, 1gn  ð1Þ  where L is the Laplacian of the SNP network.
L is defined as L ¼ D   W, where D is the diagonal matrix where Dp, p is the degree of node p. Here, we directly minimize the number of nonzero entries in f and do not require the proxy of an l1 constraint to achieve sparsity (of course in the case of binary indicators, l1 and l0 norms are equivalent).
Positive parameters   and   control the importance of the connectedness of selected features and the sparsity regularizer, respectively.
As Wp, q ¼ 1 if q is a neighbor of p (also written as p   q), and 0 otherwise, if we denote by NðpÞ the neighborhood of p, then the degree of p can be rewritten Dp, p ¼ q2NðpÞ 1.
The second term in Equation (1) can therefore be rewritten as    X  P  ð2Þ  f  Lf ¼ X  n  p q  ðfp   fqÞ2, X  and the problem in Equation (1) is equivalent to  arg min f2f0, 1gn  p¼1  fpðcp    Þ      ðfp   fqÞ2:  p q  ð3Þ  As ðfp   fqÞ2 is 1 if fp 6¼ fq and 0 otherwise, it can be seen that the connectivity term in Equation (1) penalizes the selection of SNPs not connected to one another, as well as the selection of only subnetworks of connected components of the SNP network.
It does not prohibit the selection of several disconnected subnetworks.
In particular, solutions may include individual SNPs fully disconnected from the other selected   SNPs.
Also, as n f in our case, the sparsity term in Equation (1) is equivalent to reducing the individual SNP scores c by a constant  40.

As fs ¼ 1 and ft ¼ 0 enforce that s 2 S and t=2S, it follows that Equation (1) is an s/t min-cut problem on the trans- formed graph defined by the adjacency matrix A over the vertices of G augmented by s and t. The aforementioned still holds if W is a weighted adjacency matrix, and therefore the min-cut reformulation can also be applied to a weighted network.
g  It is therefore possible to use maximal flow algorithms to ef- ficiently optimize the objective function defined in Equation (1) and select a small number of connected SNPs maximally asso- ciated with a phenotype.
In our implementation, we use the Boykov Kolmogorov algorithm (Boykov and Kolmogorov, 2004).
Although its worst case complexity is in Oðn2nEnCÞ, where nE is the number of edges of the graph and nC the size of the minimum cut, it performs much better in practice, particu- larly when the graph is sparse.
We refer to this method as SConES, for Selecting CONnected Explanatory SNPs.

3 RESULTS  We evaluate the ability of SConES to detect networks of trait- associated SNPs on simulated datasets and on datasets from an association mapping study in A.thaliana.
3.1 Experimental settings  For all of our experiments, we consider the three SNP networks defined in Section 1: the GS network, the GM network and the GI network.
For SConES, the association term c is derived from Linear SKAT (Wu et al., 2011), which makes it possible to cor- rect for covariates (and therefore population structure).
SKAT has been devised to address rare variants association problems by grouping SNPs to achieve statistical significance, but it can equally be applied to common variants.
Univariate linear regression: As a baseline for comparisons, we run a linear regression-based single-SNP search for association and select those SNPs that are significantly associated with the phenotype (Bonferroni-corrected P-value   0:05).
Linear mixed model: Similarly, we run a linear mixed model (LMM) single-SNP search for association (Lippert et al., 2011) and select those SNPs that are significantly associated with the phenotype (Bonferroni-corrected P-value   0:05).
Lasso: To compare SConES to a method that also considers all additive effects of SNPs simultaneously with a sparsity con- straint, but without any network regularization, we also run a Lasso regression (Tibshirani, 1994), using the SLEP implemen- tation (http://www.public.asu.edu/ jye02/Software/SLEP) of the Lasso.
ncLasso: In addition, we compare SConES to the network- constrained Lasso ncLasso (Li and Li, 2008), a version of the Lasso with sparsity and graph-smoothing constraints equivalent to that of SConES.
Given a genotype matrix G and a phenotype r, ncLasso solves the following relaxed problem (f 2 Rn):                                 arg min  f2Rn  1 2  Gf   r  2  2þ f    Lf þ   f  ð5Þ  1  therefore not applicable when its  The solution for ncLasso proposed by Li and Li (2008) re- quires to compute and store a single value decomposition of L and is exceeds 100 000   100 000 by far.
However, a similar solution can be obtained by decomposing L as the product of the network s in- cidence matrix with its transpose, an approach that is much faster (particularly when the network is sparse).
sizes  groupLasso and graphLasso: Eventually, we also compare our method to the nonoverlapping group Lasso (Jacob et al., 2009).
The nonoverlapping group Lasso solves the following relaxed problem:                  X                  arg min  f2Rn  1 2  Gf   r  2  2þ   g2G  G  f  2  ð6Þ  where G is a set of (possibly overlapping) predefined groups of SNPs.
We consider the following two versions:    graphLasso, for which the groups are directly defined from the same networks as considered for SConES as all pairs of vertices connected by an edge   i174    groupLasso, for which the groups are defined sensibly as  follows:   GS groups: pairs of adjacent SNPs (this gives raise to the same groups as for graphLasso with the sequence network)     GM groups: SNPs near the same gene    GI groups: SNPs near either member of two interacting genes.
Here, SNPs near genes that are not in the inter- action network get grouped by gene.
We use the SLEP implementation of the nonoverlapping group Lasso, combined with the trick described by Jacob et al.
(2009) to compute the overlapping group Lasso by replicating features in nonoverlapping groups.
Setting the parameters: All methods considered, except for the univariate linear regression, have parameters (e.g.
and   in the case of SConES) that need to be optimized.
In our experiments, we run 10-fold cross-validation grid-search experiments over ranges of values of the parameters: seven values of   and   each for SConES and ncLasso and seven values of the parameter   for the Lasso and the nonoverlapping group Lasso (ranging from 10 3 to 103).
We then pick as optimal the parameters leading to the most stable selection and report as finally selected the features selected in all folds.
More specifically, we define stability accord- ing to a consistency index similar to that of Kuncheva (2007).
The consistency index between two feature sets S and S0 is defined as ICðS, S0Þ ¼ njS\S0j jSjjS0j found in the Supplementary Materials).
For an experiment with k folds, the consistency is computed as the average of the kðk   1Þ=2 pairwise consistencies between the sets of features selected over each fold.

To assess the perform- ance of our methods, we simulate from 100 to 200 000 SNPs for 200 individuals and generate exponential random networks with a density of 2% (chosen as an upper limit on the density of currently available gene-gene interaction networks) between those SNPs.
We report the real CPU runtime of one cross-validation, for set parameters, over a single AMD Opteron CPU (2048 KB, 2600 MHz) with 512 GB of memory, running Ubuntu 12.04 (Fig.
3).
Across a wide range of numbers of SNPs, SConES is at least two orders of magnitude faster than graphLasso and one order of magnitude faster than ncLasso.
3.3 Simulations  To assess the performance of our methods, we simulate pheno- types for m¼ 500 real A.thaliana genotypes (214 051 SNPs), chosen at random among those made available by Horton et al.
(2012), and the A.thaliana protein protein interaction in- formation from The Arabidopsis Internet Resource (TAIR, http://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/proteome/proteinInteract.jsp, resulting in 55 584 646 SNP SNP connections).
We use a window size of 20 000 bp to define proximity of a SNP to a gene, in accordance with the threshold used for the interpret- ation of GWAS results in Atwell et al.
(2010).

frequency larger than 10%, we pick 20 of the SNPs to be causal, and generate phenotypes yi ¼ w gi þ  , where both the support weights w and the noise   are normally distributed.
We consider the following scenarios: (a) the causal SNPs are randomly distributed in the network  (b) the causal SNPs are adjacent on the genomic sequence  (c) the causal SNPs are near the same gene  (d f) the causal SNPs are near either of two, three and five interacting genes, respectively.
We then select SNPs using univariate linear regression, Lasso, ncLasso, the two flavors of nonoverlapping group Lasso and SConES as described in Section 3.1.
We repeat each experiment 30 times and compare the selected SNPs of either approach with the true causal ones in terms of power (fraction of causal SNPs selected) or false discovery rate (FDR, fraction of selected SNPs that are not causal).
We summarize the results with F-scores (harmonic mean of power and one minus FDR) in Table 1.
As SConES returns a binary feature selection rather than a feature ranking, it is not possible to draw FDR curves or com- pare powers at same FDR as is often done when evaluating such methods.
Figure 4 presents the average FDR and power of the different algorithms under three of the scenarios, depending on the network used.
The closer the FDR power point representing an algorithm to the upper-left corner, the better this algorithm at maximizing power while minimizing FDR.
As it is easy to get better power by selecting more SNPs, we also report on the same figure the number of SNPs selected by each algorithm and show that it remains reasonably close to the true value of 20 causal SNPs.
SConES is systematically better than its state-of-the-art com- parison partners at leveraging structural information to retrieve the connected SNPs that were causal.

Furthermore, we observe that removing a small frac- tion (1 15%) of the edges between causal features does not harm the performance of SConES (Supplementary Table S1).
This means that SConES is robust to missing edges, an important point when the biological network used is likely to be incomplete.
Nevertheless, the performance of SConES, as that of all other network-regularized approaches, is strongly negatively affected when the network is entirely inappropriate [Scenario (a)].
In add- ition, the decrease in performance from Scenario (c) to Scenario (f), when the number of interacting genes near which the causal SNPs are located increases from 1 to 5, indicates that SConES, like its structure-regularized comparison partners, performs better when the causal SNPs are less spread out in the network.
Finally, ncLasso is both slower and less performing than SConES.
This indicates that solving the feature selection prob- lem we pose directly, rather than its relaxed version, allows for better recovery of true causal features.
3.4 Arabidopsis flowering time phenotypes We then apply our method to a large collection of 17 A.thaliana flowering times phenotypes from Atwell et al.
(2010) (up to 194 individuals, 214 051 SNPs).
The groups and networks are again derived from the TAIR protein protein interaction data.
We filter out SNPs with a minor allele frequency lower than 10%, as is typical in A.thaliana GWAS studies.
We use the first prin- cipal components of the genotypic data as covariates to correct  i176  for population structure (Price et al., 2006): the number of prin- cipal components is chosen by adding them one by one until the genomic control is close to 1 (see Supplementary Figure S1).
The direct competitors of SConES on this problem are the methods that also impose graph constraints on the SNPs they select, namely, graphLasso and ncLasso.
However, graphLasso does not scale to datasets such as ours with 4200 k SNPs (see Fig.
3).
Hence, we had to exclude it from our experiments.
While even our accelerated implementation of ncLasso could not be run on 4125 000 SNPs in our simulations, the networks derived for A.thaliana are sparser than that used in the simulations, which makes it possible to run ncLasso on this data.
Instead, we compare SConES to ncLasso and groupLasso, which uses pairs of neighboring SNPs, SNPs from the same gene or SNPs from interacting genes as predefined groups.
The groupLasso on sequence-neighboring SNPs is identical to graphLasso on the sequence network, which is the only instance of graphLasso whose computation is practically feasible on this dataset.
We run Lasso, ncLasso, groupLasso and SConES on the flowering time phenotypes as described in Section 3.1.
However, for many of the phenotypes, the Lasso approaches select large number of SNPs (410 000), which makes the results hard to interprete.
Using cross-validated predictivity, as is generally done for Lasso, still does not entirely solve this issue, particularly for large group sizes (see Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).
We therefore filter out solutions containing41% of the total number of SNPs before using consistency to select the optimal parameters.
To evaluate the quality of the SNPs selected, we perform ridge regression on each phenotype in a cross-validation scheme that uses only the selected SNPs and report its average Pearson s squared correlation coefficient in Figure 5.
We also report, as an additional baseline, the cross-validated predictivity of a stand- ard best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) (Henderson, 1975).
Although the features selected by groupLassoþ GS achieve higher predictivity than SConESþ GS on most phenotypes, the features selected by SConESþ GM are at least as predictive as those selected by groupLassoþ GM in two thirds of the pheno- types  the picture is the same for SConESþ GI, whose selected than those of SNPs are on average more predictive groupLassoþ GI.
The superiority of groupLasso in that respect is to be expected, as predicitivity is directly optimized by the regression.
Also in 80% of the cases, if any of the feature selec- tion methods achieves high predictivity (R240:6), SConES out- performs all other methods including BLUP.
Next, we checked whether the selected SNPs from the three methods coincide with flowering time genes from the literature.
We report in Table 2 the number of SNPs selected by each of the methods and the proportion of these SNPs that are near flower- ing time candidate genes listed by Segura et al.
(2012).
Here, the picture is reversed: SConESþ GS and groupLassoþ GI retrieve the highest ratio of SNPs near candidate genes, whereas groupLassoþ GS, SConESþ GI and SConESþ GM show lower ratios.
At first sight, it seems surprising that the methods with highest predictive power retrieve the least SNPs near can- didate genes.
To further investigate this phenomenon, we record how many distinct flowering time candidate genes are retrieved on average by the various methods.
A gene is considered retrieved if the   (a)  (b)  (c)  Network-guided multi-locus mapping  Fig.

method selects a SNP near it.
Our results are shown in Table 3.
Methods retrieving a large fraction of SNPs near candidate genes do not necessarily retrieve the largest number of distinct candi- date genes.
Good predictive power, as shown in Figure 5, how- ever, seems to correlate with the number of distinct candidate genes selected by an algorithm, not with the percentage of se- lected SNPs near candidate genes.
groupLassoþ GI has the highest fraction of candidate gene SNPs among all methods but detects only three distinct candidate genes.
This is probably due to groupLasso selecting entire genes or gene pairs  if groupLasso detects a candidate gene, it will pick most of the SNPs near that gene, which leads to its high candidate SNP ratio in Table 2.
We also compare the selected SNPs to those deemed signifi- cant by a LMM ran on the full data (see Supplementary Table S4).
SConES systematically recovers more of those SNPs than the Lasso approaches.
To summarize, SConES is able to select SNPs that are highly predictive of the phenotype.
Among all methods, SConESþ GM discovers the largest number of distinct genes whose involvement in flowering time is supported by the literature.
4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  In this article, we defined SConES, a novel approach to multi- locus mapping that selects SNPs that tend to be connected in a given biological network without restricting the search to prede- fined sets of loci.
As the optimization of SConES can be solved by maximum flow, our solution is computationally efficient and scales to whole-genome data.
Our experiments show that our method is one to two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art Lasso-based comparison partners and can there- fore thousands of SNPs.

superior  selected by SConES is  On real GWAS data from A.thaliana, the predictive ability of the features to that of groupLasso on two of the three network types we consider.
When using more biological information (gene membership or interactions), SConES tends to recover more distinct explanatory genes than groupLasso, resulting in better phenotypic prediction.
The constraints imposed by groupLasso and SConES are dif- ferent: although the groups given to groupLasso and the net- works passed to SConES come from the same information, the groups force many more SNPs to be selected simultaneously when they may not bring much more information.
This gives SConES more flexibility and makes it less vulnerable to ill-defined groups or networks, which is especially desirable in the light of the current noisiness and incompleteness of biological networks.
Our results on the GS network actually indicate that graphLasso, using pairs of network edges as groups, may achieve the same flexibility as SConES  unfortunately, it is too computationally demanding to be run on the most informative networks.
We currently derive the SNP networks from neighborhood along the genome sequence, closeness to a same gene or proxim- ity to interacting proteins.
Refining those networks and explor- ing other types of networks as well as understanding the effects of their topology and density is one of our next projects.
Although we do not explicitly consider linkage disequilibrium, the l0 sparsity constraint of SConES should enforce that when several correlated SNPs are associated with a phenotype, a single one of them is picked.
On the other hand, if SConES is given a GS network such as the one we describe, the graph smoothness constraint will encourage nearby SNPs to be selected together, leading to the selection of subsequences that are likely to be haplotype blocks.
Such a network should therefore only be used when the goal of the experiment is to detect consecutive sequences of associated SNPs.
i178  For now, SConES considers an additive model between genetic loci.
Future work includes taking pairwise multiplicative effects into account.
Replacing the association term in Equation (1) by a sum over pairs of SNPs rather than over individual SNPs results in a maximum flow problem over a fully connected net- work of SNPs, which cannot be solved straightforwardly, if only because the resulting adjacency matrix is too large to fit in memory on a regular computer.
It might be possible, however, to leverage some of the techniques used for two-locus GWAS (Achlioptas et al., 2011  Kam-Thong et al., 2012) to help solve this problem.
Extensions of SConES to other models include the use of mixed models to account for population structure and other confounders.
This is currently a challenge, as it is unclear how to derive additive test statistics from such models.
An interesting extension to study would replace the Laplacian by a random-walk-based matrix, derived from powers of the adjacency matrix, so as to treat disconnected SNPs that are close-by in the networks differently from those that are far apart.
Although we already observe that SConES is robust to edge removal, this would likely make it more resistant to missing edges.
Another important extension of SConES is to devise a way to evaluate the statistical significance of the set of selected SNPs.
Regularized feature selection approaches such as SConES or its Lasso comparison partners do not lend themselves well to the computation of P-values.
Permutation tests could be an option, but the number of permutations to run is difficult to evaluate as is that of hypotheses tested.
Another possibility would be to im- plement the multiple-sample splitting approach proposed by Meinshausen et al.
(2009).
However, the loss of power from per- forming selection on only subsets of the samples is too large, given the sizes of current genomic datasets, to make this feasible.
Therefore, evaluating statistical significance and controlling FDRs of Lasso and SConES approaches alike remain a chal- lenge for the future.
Finally,  further exciting research topics include applying SConES to larger datasets from human disease consortia (we estimate it would require less than a day to run on a million of SNPs) and extending it to the detection of shared networks of markers between multiple phenotypes.
