Measles is one of the most contagious viral diseases, and remains a major cause of
childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. The measles virus (MV), a member of the
family Paramyxoviridae, enters cells through a cellular receptor, the signaling lymphocyte
activation molecule (SLAM), CD46 or nectin-4. Entry is mediated by two MV envelope glyco-
proteins, the hemagglutinin (H) and the fusion (F) protein.The H protein mediates receptor
attachment, while the F protein causes membrane fusion. The interaction between the
H and F proteins is essential to initiate the cell entry process. Recently determined crys-
tal structures of the MV-H protein unbound and bound to SLAM or CD46 have provided
insights into paramyxovirus entry and the effectiveness of measles vaccine.

INTRODUCTION
Measles virus (MV), the agent that causes measles, is an enveloped,
non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus, a member of the
genus Morbillivirus, the family Paramyxoviridae (Grifﬁn, 2007).
Paramyxoviruses also include, among others, mumps virus, New-
castle disease virus (NDV), human parainﬂuenza viruses (hPIV),
and emerging Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), mem-
bers of the genus Henipavirus (Lamb and Parks, 2007). MV enters
cells through membrane fusion in a pH-independent manner,
like other paramyxoviruses. MV possesses two glycoproteins on
its envelope, an attachment protein hemagglutinin (H) (MV-H)
and a fusion (F) protein (MV-F) (Grifﬁn, 2007). MV-H and MV-
F form hetero-oligomer, which is required to induce membrane
fusion. Upon receptor binding, MV-H is thought to undergo a
conformational change, which in turn would trigger a structural
rearrangement of MV-F from the metastable pre-fusion form to
the intermediate and post-fusion forms (Plemper et al., 2011).
This conformational change of MV-F would drive the fusion
between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane. Currently,
the detailed structural organization of MV-H and MV-F remains
elusive.

The paramyxovirus attachment proteins are classiﬁed into
three groups based on their functions, the hemagglutinin–
neuraminidase (HN) protein, the H protein, and the G protein.
Although these attachment proteins may have a common assem-
bly process, their interaction with the F protein may be viral
species-dependent, and different paramyxoviruses may use differ-
ent strategies for fusion activation (Lamb and Parks, 2007; Iorio
and Mahon, 2008; Connolly et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009; Plemper
et al., 2011). Among paramyxoviruses, only those belonging to the

genera Morbillivirus and Henipavirus recognize protein receptors
expressed on the target cell surface. This is in marked contrast to
most other members of the family Paramyxoviridae, which con-
tain the neuraminidase domain in their HN proteins and recognize
sialic acid-containing receptors.

Three protein molecules have been identiﬁed as MV receptors,
the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM), CD46, and
nectin-4. On the other hand, NiV and HeV utilize as receptors
ephrin (Eph) B2 and EphB3, which belong to the highly conserved
Eph family of tyrosine kinase receptors (Bonaparte et al., 2005;
Negrete et al., 2005, 2006). Although both MV and henipaviruses
recognize protein receptors, there is a large structural difference
between MV-H and henipavirus G proteins (Bowden et al., 2010).
The G proteins exhibit a structural-fold property closer to that of
HN proteins. This suggests that MV-H and henipavirus G pro-
teins have independently evolved the ability to recognize protein
receptors.

One clinical isolate obtained from a child in 1954 known as the
Edmonston strain gave rise to the majority of current MV vaccine
strains (Katz, 2009). After 50 years, its progeny (Edmonston lin-
eage) are still effective as live attenuated vaccines. It is estimated
that more than 4.5 million measles deaths have been prevented
annually through implementation of the vaccination strategies
developed by WHO and UNISEF (Bellini and Rota, 2011).

Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of MV
entry, based on crystal structures of MV-H–receptor complexes
as well as functional studies. We compare the attachment protein-
receptor complex of MV with those of other paramyxoviruses, and
provide a general principle of paramyxovirus entry. We also dis-
cuss why MV has only one major serotype and why our current

MV vaccine prepared more than ﬁve decades ago from a single
strain is still effective.

MV RECEPTORS
CD46
Currently, three receptors are identiﬁed, which facilitate MV entry.
CD46 (also called membrane cofactor protein) is the ﬁrst MV
receptor discovered by two groups independently in 1993 (Dorig
et al., 1993; Naniche et al., 1993). CD46 is a type I membrane pro-
tein that belongs to the regulators of complement activation (RCA)
family. CD46 comprises an N-terminal signal sequence, four short
consensus repeats (SCR1–SCR4), a transmembrane region, and
a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Each SCR module contains ∼60
amino acids that fold into a compact β-barrel structure (Persson
et al., 2010). N-terminal domains SCR1 and SCR2 participate in
the interaction with MV-H (Santiago et al., 2010).

CD46 is expressed on all nucleated human cells, and acts as a
cofactor in the proteolytic inactivation of C3b and C4b by factor
I. Monkey, but not human, erythrocytes express CD46, allowing
hemagglutination by MV (Cole et al., 1985; Kemper and Atkinson,
2009). Interestingly, only vaccine and laboratory-adapted strains
of MV can utilize CD46 as a receptor, while clinically isolated MV
strains employ different receptors for entry.

SIGNALING LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION MOLECULE
Measles viruses were found to be efﬁciently isolated from clini-
cal specimens by using the marmoset B cell line B95a or other
human B cell lines (Kobune et al., 1990; Schneider-Schaulies et al.,
1995). Further, MVs obtained using these cell lines were unable to
downregulate CD46 or induce cell-to-cell fusion in CD46-positive
cell lines (Lecouturier et al., 1996; Bartz et al., 1998; Tanaka et al.,
1998). These observations suggested the presence of MV recep-
tor(s) other than CD46. In 2000, SLAM (also known as CD150)
was identiﬁed as a principal cellular receptor for all MV strains
(Tatsuo et al., 2000).

Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule, a member of the
immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, is a type I membrane protein
that possesses an N-terminal signal sequence, two Ig-like domains
(V-set and C2-set), a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic
tail (Cocks et al., 1995). Each Ig-like domain has ∼110 amino acid
residues. Only the membrane-distal V-set domain is necessary and
sufﬁcient for MV-H binding. The V domain is comprised of the
(cid:2)(cid:2) β-sheet, which utilize a Cys32–Cys132 disul-
BED and AGFCC
ﬁde bond to stabilize the A–G interstrand interaction (Hashiguchi
et al., 2011).

C

(cid:2)

In humans, SLAM is expressed on thymocytes, activated lym-
phocyte, mature dendritic cells, macrophages, and platelets. How-
ever, it is absent from monocytes, natural killer cells, and gran-
ulocytes (Schwartzberg et al., 2009). The distribution of SLAM
nicely explains the tropism and immunosuppressive nature of MV
(Yanagi et al., 2009).

NECTIN-4
Although epithelial cells do not express SLAM, MV antigens, and
syncytia have been observed in the epithelia of various organs
from measles patients and experimentally infected monkeys. It
was found that a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line NCI-H358

supports SLAM- and CD46-independent MV infection (Takeda
et al., 2007). Furthermore, several polarized epithelial cell lines
have been reported to be susceptible to MV (Takeda et al., 2007;
Leonard et al., 2008; Tahara et al., 2008). Together, these data hinted
at the presence of a third MV receptor.

Recent studies have identiﬁed nectin-4 as an epithelial cell
receptor (Muhlebach et al., 2011; Noyce et al., 2011). Human
nectin-4 is expressed mainly in placenta cells, and to a lesser degree
in trachea cells (Reymond et al., 2001). Nectin-4 is a member of
the poliovirus receptor-like proteins (PVRLs), which are adhe-
sion receptors of the Ig superfamily. Similar to SLAM, this type I
membrane protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence, three
Ig-like domains (V-set and two C2-set), a transmembrane region,
and a cytoplasmic tail. Each Ig-like domain is predicted to be ∼105
amino acid residues. Both wild type and the Edmonston lineage
MV strains can use nectin-4 as a receptor.

MV-H PROTEIN
The MV-H is a type II membrane glycoprotein comprised of an
N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region, a stalk, and
a C-terminal receptor-binding head domain. The head domain
of MV-H exhibits a six-bladed β-propeller fold, a feature con-
served among all head domains of paramyxovirus attachment
proteins thus far crystallized (Colf et al., 2007; Hashiguchi et al.,
2007). Without a neuraminidase domain, MV-H targets protein
receptors, SLAM, CD46, and nectin-4. The difference in receptor
preference between H and HN proteins reﬂects the difference in
their head domain structures (see below).

Crystal structure of the MV-H head domain reveals a top
pocket reminiscent of the sialic acid binding cavity found in
both HN proteins and the neuraminidase (NA) of inﬂuenza virus
(Flu). However, the pocket in MV-H is enlarged and lacks several
key residues that contribute to sialic acid binding. In addition,
the N-linked sugar at position 215 of MV-H (located at the
rim of the pocket) renders the top pocket inaccessible to sialic
acid, antibodies or other molecules. The MV-H head domain
exhibits a cubic shape, and forms a homodimer (Hashiguchi
et al., 2007). Two neighboring N-linked sugars at position 200
(one each from both monomers), located at the homodimer inter-
face, likely block access to the region, which in HN of NDV, has
been proposed to contain a second sialic acid binding site. Sim-
ilarly, HNs of hPIV3 and PIV5 do not contain a second sialic
acid binding site due to N-linked sugar at Asn523 and Asn497,
respectively.

INTERACTION BETWEEN MV-H AND RECEPTORS
Mutagenesis studies have suggested that receptor-binding sites on
MV-H are located on the side of the β-propeller, which was subse-
quently conﬁrmed by the crystal structures of MV-H complexed
with SCR1 and SCR2 of CD46 or with the V domain of SLAM
(Figure 1A; Santiago et al., 2010; Hashiguchi et al., 2011). By con-
trast, attachment proteins of NDV, hPIV3, and PIV5, NA of Flu
and G proteins of NiV and HeV utilize the top pocket of the β-
propeller structure for binding to their corresponding receptors
or ligand (Figure 1B; Burmeister et al., 1992; Crennell et al., 2000;
Lawrence et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2005; Bowden et al., 2008; Xu
et al., 2008).

MV-H tetramer with each monomer bound to SLAM (cyan). MV-H
monomers A (green) and B (light green) form one dimer, whereas

Crystal structure of MV-H bound to CD46 reveals that β-sheet
4 (β4) and β5 of the β-propeller structure interact with SCR1
and SCR2 of CD46 (Figure 1A; Santiago et al., 2010). Key residues
Tyr481 and Gly546 on MV-H make hydrogen bonds with the main
chain oxygen group of Cys65 and the main chain amino group
of Glu63 on CD46, respectively. Furthermore, a serine-to-glycine
mutation at position 546 on MV-H (found in some CD46-using
MV strains) likely increases ﬂexibility of the β5s3–β5s4 region,
which is favorable for CD46 binding. Pro38 and Pro39 on CD46
are sandwiched between β4 residues Leu464 and Leu500 and β5
residues Tyr541 and Tyr543 on MV-H, while Tyr67 on CD46 makes
a hydrophobic interaction with Val451 on MV-H. The interac-
tion between MV-H and CD46 is relatively week (K d, 2.2 μM;
Hashiguchi et al., 2007).

Crystal structure of MV-H in complex with SLAM shows that
β4–6 and loop regions on the lateral surface of the MV-H β-
propeller structure interact with GFCC
region of the SLAM-V
domain (Figure 1A; Hashiguchi et al., 2011). This interaction is

C

(cid:2)

also conﬁrmed by functional assays, surface plasmon resonance
and infectious assay in vitro. Salt bridges formed by residues
Asp530 and Arg533 on MV-H and Glu123 on SLAM play a key
role in stabilizing the MV-H–SLAM complex. An intermolecular
β-sheet, comprised of residues Pro191-Arg195 (β6) of MV-H and
residues Ser127-Phe131 (G sheet) of SLAM-V, further stabilizes the
MV-H–SLAM complex. Mouse SLAM does not contain the MV-
H-interacting key residues, including His61 and Arg130, and there-
fore does not act as a MV receptor (Ono et al., 2001). Although
SLAM interacts with another SLAM through its V domain, the
afﬁnity of SLAM–SLAM interaction (K d of ∼200 μM) is over
400-fold lower than that of the MV-H–SLAM interaction (K d
of 0.29 ∼ 0.43 μM; Hashiguchi et al., 2007). Therefore, upon MV
infection, SLAM preferentially interacts with MV-H rather than
adjacent SLAM.

Mutagenesis studies have mapped nectin-4 binding sites in a
region partly shared by SLAM-binding sites (Leonard et al., 2008;
Tahara et al., 2008). Amino acids in this region are highly conserved

among morbilliviruses, whereas CD46 binding sites are not. Thus,
it is likely that many morbilliviruses utilize this region of the H
protein to infect immune and epithelial cells.

Like other paramyxovirus attachment proteins, MV-H forms a
homodimer (or tetramer, see below). Interestingly, two monomers
forming the MV-H dimer are highly tilted from each other, in
contrast to other paramyxovirus attachment proteins (Hashiguchi
et al., 2007). As a result, the receptor-binding sites on MV-H
(located at the side of the β-propeller) are oriented upward in
such a way that they are readily accessible to cellular receptors.
This structural property and the inaccessibility of the top pocket
due to N-linked sugar at position 215 account for the difference in
receptor-binding sites between MV-H and other paramyxovirus
attachment proteins.

MV-H TETRAMER AND MEMBRANE FUSION TRIGGERING
The mechanism by which receptor-binding leads to F protein-
mediated membrane fusion is not well understood. However,
crystal structures of MV-H–CD46 and MV-H–SLAM have also
provided clues for this intriguing process (Santiago et al., 2010;
Hashiguchi et al., 2011). No large structural change is observed in
the MV-H monomer between receptor-free and receptor-bound
forms. Furthermore, the relative orientation of two monomers
in the MV-H dimer also remains essentially identical before and
after receptor binding (r.m.s. deviation of 1.95 Å for 751 Ca atoms
in MV-H–SLAM; r.m.s. deviation of 1.33 Å for 791 Ca atoms in
MV-H–CD46).

Interestingly, crystal structures of the MV-H–SLAM complex
reveal two different tetrameric conﬁgurations (dimer of dimers),
form I and form II (Figure 1C; Hashiguchi et al., 2011). The
tetrameric formation of MV-H is also detected by native PAGE
and immunoblotting when the full-length MV-H is transiently
expressed in cells. Recently reported crystal structures of NDV
and PIV5 also reveal a four-helix bundle stalk (Bose et al., 2011;
Yuan et al., 2011). MV-H monomers A and B form one dimer, while
monomers C and D form another, and SLAM is bound to each MV-
H monomer. Form I exhibits a conformation similar to previously
reported head domains of NDV-HN, hPIV3-HN, PIV5-HN, and
Flu-NA, although the relative position of monomers in the dimer
units varies depending on the viral protein. In form II, a shift in the
dimer of dimers occurs, enabling SLAM to bridge two neighboring
monomers. Monomers A and C form the dimer–dimer interface
in form I (contact area of 1.312 Å), whereas monomers B and D
mainly form the dimer–dimer interface in form II (contact area of
2.099 Å). Based on these structural features, we propose the follow-
ing fusion triggering mechanism. Upon the virus–cell interaction,
the MV-H–SLAM complex in form I is formed. This structure
renders the orientation of SLAM parallel rather than perpendic-
ular in relation to the host membrane, and substantially reduces
the distance between viral envelope and host membrane. This may
prepare the environment suitable for subsequent conformational
changes of MV-H and MV-F. The ensuing conformational shift of
MV-H from form I to form II reorganizes the stalk region, allow-
ing MV-F to refold and interact with the target cell membrane
(Hashiguchi et al., 2011).

In a recent study, disulﬁde bonds were introduced at the protein
interface to covalently anchor the two head domains in the MV-H

dimer, leading to the block of its fusion-support activity (Navarat-
narajah et al., 2011). The authors proposed that the two head
domains in an MV-H dimer twist relative to each other upon recep-
tor binding, which triggers membrane fusion. However, twisting of
the head domains is not consistent with crystal structures of MV-H
bound and unbound to receptors (Hashiguchi et al., 2007, 2011;
Santiago et al., 2010). These introduced disulﬁde bonds might
somehow prevent the proper formation of MV-H tetramer or its
conformational shift upon receptor binding (Saphire and Old-
stone, 2011). The similar experiment with the NDV-HN protein
did not affect its fusion-support activity (Mahon et al., 2008).

Two models have been proposed for fusion triggering in
paramyxoviruses. In one model, the attachment protein undergoes
a conformational change upon receptor binding. This conforma-
tional change directly affects the F protein, causing its refolding
which in turn drives membrane fusion. This model is consis-
tent with the data for viruses using sialic acid as a receptor. In
cells infected with hPIV3 and PIV5, the HN protein is associated
with the F protein on the cell surface, but not in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) (Paterson et al., 1997). Furthermore, the increased
strength of the HN-F interaction enhances fusion activity. These
results suggest that upon receptor binding, HN actively acts on the
F protein and facilitates its refolding (Connolly et al., 2009). In
the second model, the attachment protein serves as a clamp that
stabilizes the F protein in its pre-fusion state. Receptor binding
of the attachment protein releases the F protein from the clamp
to facilitate its spontaneous conformational change. MV entry is
consistent with this model. MV-H is already associated with MV-
F within the ER (Plemper et al., 2001), and the conformational
shift of the tetramer is likely to facilitate the release of MV-F from
the heteromeric H–F oligomers. This release model is also sup-
ported by the data that a weaker interaction between MV-H and
MV-F results in increased fusogenicity (Plemper et al., 2002; Corey
and Iorio, 2009). A similar release model has also been proposed
for NiV and HeV (Aguilar et al., 2006, 2007; Bishop et al., 2007).
Thus, different paramyxoviruses may use different mechanisms of
fusion triggering, although the overall cell entry mechanism may
be similar among them.

STRUCTURAL INSIGHT INTO MV SEROTYPE AND VACCINE
Crystal structure of MV-H sheds light on why measles vaccine
has been successful for a long time (Hashiguchi et al., 2007, 2011;
Ruigrok and Gerlier, 2007). The structure suggests that N-linked
sugars (at positions 168, 187, 200, and 215) on MV-H cover a
considerable portion of its surface, only exposing a small area for
receptor and antibody bindings (Figures 2A,B). Indeed, crystal
structures of MV-H–SLAM and MV-H–CD46 complexes indi-
cate that both receptors target this exposed area. Mutagenesis
studies have also revealed that nectin-4 binds to this region as
well. Furthermore, a majority of MV-H monoclonal antibodies
are mapped onto this exposed receptor-binding area, indicating
that this area acts as the epitope “hot spot.” This overlap of bind-
ing sites for receptors and neutralizing antibodies explains why
measles vaccine, derived from a single strain, remains effective
against all 23 distinct MV genotypes. A functional importance
(receptor binding) likely exerts a restrain that renders this region
highly unfavorable to mutation. As a result, MV still occurs in

only a single serotype (Hashiguchi et al., 2011). Interestingly, this
receptor-binding area is highly conserved not only among MV
strains but also among morbilliviruses, suggesting that this region
could serve as a template for a universal vaccine targeting all
morbilliviruses (Hashiguchi et al., 2007). The human immunod-
eﬁciency virus glycoprotein lacks the similarly conserved region
to be targeted by antibodies, which has hampered the vaccine
development.

PERSPECTIVE
Recent advances in our understanding of MV-H structures, com-
bined with functional studies, have provided new insights into the
mechanism of MV entry. Although the receptor-binding mode
of MV-H is different from that of other paramyxovirus HN and
G proteins, the overall entry process may be common among
paramyxoviruses. MV-H forms tetramer (dimer of dimers), like
other HN and G proteins, and we propose a model for fusion trig-
gering, based on the presence of two forms of MV-H tetramer.

However, further structural studies of MV-H and MV-F are
required to completely understand the whole process of MV entry.
Crystal structures have also illuminated how a sugar-uncovered,
exposed area of MV-H is targeted by receptors as well as by neu-
tralizing antibodies. This nicely explains why only a single serotype
occurs for MV and why measles vaccine, derived from one strain,
has been effective for a long time. It is hoped that better under-
standing of the MV entry process will not only contribute to our
measles eradication effort worldwide, but also allow us to develop
effective vaccines for other challenging pathogens.
