Abstract:  Relatively  little  is  known  about  the  microbial  communities  adapted  to  soil  environments  contaminated  with 
aged complex hydrocarbon mixtures, especially in the subsurface soil layers. In this work we studied the microbial com-
munities in  two different  soil profiles down to the depth of 7 m which originated from  a 30-year-old site contaminated 
with petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) and from a clean site next to the contaminated site. The concentration of oxygen in 
the contaminated soil profile was strongly reduced in soil layers below 1 m depth but not in the clean soil profile. Total 
microbial  biomass  and  community  composition  was  analyzed  by  phospholipid  fatty  acid  (PLFA)  measurements.  The  
diversity of fungi and actinobacteria was investigated more in detail by construction of rDNA-based clone libraries. The 
results revealed that there was a significant and diverse microbial community in subsoils at depth below 2 m, also in con-
ditions where oxygen was limiting. The diversity of actinobacteria was different in the two soil profiles; the contaminated 
soil  profile  was  dominated  by  Mycobacterium  -related  sequences  whereas  sequences  from  the  clean  soil  samples  were  
related to other, generally uncultured organisms, some of which may represent two new subclasses of actinobacteria. One 
dominating fungal sequence which matched with the ascomycotes Acremonium sp. and Paecilomyces sp. was identified 
both in clean and in contaminated soil profiles. Thus, although the relative amounts of fungi and actinobacteria in these 
microbial  communities  were  highest  in  the  upper  soil  layers,  many  representatives  from  these  groups  were  found  in  
hydrocarbon contaminated subsoils even under oxygen limited conditions.  

INTRODUCTION 

 
Soil microbial communities are among the most complex 
and  diverse  assemblages  in  the  biosphere  and  they  play  an 
important  role  in  all  the  ecosystem  services  provided  
by  soils.  Therefore  microbial  processes  in  soils  have  been 
frequently studied especially in the uppermost soil layers. In 
contrast,  studies  of  subsurface  soil  environments  have  often 
not adequately characterized microbial community composi-
tion and diversity partly because of the cost and difficulty in 
obtaining large numbers of samples. Therefore, it is not clear 
if  the  subsurface  microbial  communities  are  closely  linked  
to  the  surface  soil  microbes  or  if  they  represent  a  distinct 
microbial community [1]. The role of microbial communities 
and  especially  their  activities  in  subsurface  environments  
is  receiving  increased  attention  due  to  their  importance  to 
ecosystem  function,  agriculture  and  environmental  manage-
ment  [2,  3].  The  bioremediation  processes,  where  micro-
organisms  degrade  hazardous  compounds  like  petroleum 
hydrocarbons  (PHCs)  to  non-hazardous  inorganic  com-
pounds, is an example of environmental services provided by 
soils.  The  hazardous  compounds  will  in  most  cases  not  be 
restricted to the upper soil layer but will eventually percolate 
to the subsurface [4], where they are a potential threat to the 
quality of groundwater resources.

In  Finland  200  new  cases  of  environmental  contamina-
tion due to oil leakage are reported annually. Bioremediation 
processes  in  surface  soils  are  often  efficient  and  can  be 
monitored relatively  easily.  Less  is known about  the micro-
bial  populations  in  soil  environments  contaminated  with 
complex hydrocarbon mixtures, especially in  the subsurface 
soil  layers.  It  is  likely,  that  the  degrading  micro-organisms 
and the degradation processes in subsurface soils differ from 
the  surface  soils  because  of  differences  in  the  chemical  and 
physical  environment  (e.g.  organic  matter  content  and  gas 
composition).  Traditionally  bioremediation  studies  have  
focused  on  fast  growing  and  nutrient-demanding  bacterial 
groups  such  as  Pseudomonas.  It  is  possible  however,  that 
these traits are not very useful in subsurface soils where nu-
trients are scarce and the environmental conditions are harsh. 
Therefore the use of such organisms for bioremediation pur-
poses  may  often  have  been  unsuccessful  due  to  limited 
knowledge  of  prevailing  in  situ  conditions  and  microbial 
requirements  during  the  bioremediation  process.  Moreover, 
the  microbial  community  composition  varies  between  soil 
types,  and  different  populations  of  degraders  therefore  
become dominant in different soils [5].  

 
In subsurface soils, the substrate consumption leads with 
time to mass transfer-limited conditions and soil populations 
are  most  likely  not  growing,  except  for  transient  growth  on 
decaying  cells  [6,  7].  These  conditions  are  likely  to  favor 
microbes with low growth rates and long-term survival char-
acteristics like low energy demands as well as investment of 
energy in maintenance. Gram positive bacteria and fungi are

typical representatives of this group of micro-organisms. The 
Gram  positive  actinobacteria  are  aerobes  or  microaerophils, 
but it is not known if they posses possible  anaerobic degra-
dation properties. The actinobacteria have been  encountered 
in late succession stages of soil [8] and they have also been 
reported to increase with increasing soil depth [9]. Members 
of  the  actinobacteria  have  been  reported  to  aerobically  and 
microaerobically  degrade  hydrocarbons  in  many  soils  [5], 
including  alpine  [10]  and  polar  soils  [11].  Most  fungi  are 
obligate aerobes, but many yeasts and several mycelial fungi 
are facultative anaerobes, being able to ferment sugars or to 
use nitrate or sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. How-
ever, there is hardly any information on the anaerobic degra-
dation  of  contaminants  by  fungi.  Some  fungi  are  able  to 
aerobically degrade a wide range of PHCs and are thought to 
play an important role in the primary attack of poorly avail-
able  pollutants  making  them  more  susceptible  to  bacterial 
degradation [12]. Under some conditions fungi may even be 
more effective degraders than bacteria [13], since the initial 
attack  on  high  molecular  weight  hydrocarbons  by  fungal 
exoenzymes may give them an advantage compared to bacte-
ria  in  soil  [6].  Therefore  the  role  of  fungi  in  degradation  of 
PHCs  may  be  important.  Until  now  studies  on  fungi  and 
actinobacteria  that  degrade  PHCs  in  subsoil  are  scarce.  The 
reason  that  these  groups  of  microbes  have  not  received  the 
attention  they  deserve  is  that  they  are  slow  growing  and  
often  demanding  to  culture  by  current  culturing  techniques. 
With the use of molecular tools, which take advantage of the 
species specific nucleic acids sequences, the microbial com-
munities in different environments can be described without 
the  need  of  culturing  them  in  laboratory  conditions.  Recent 
studies  on  microbial  community  composition  using  cloning 
and sequencing of PCR  amplified bacterial 16S rDNA have 
shown  that  actinobacteria  are  commonly  found  in  small 
amounts  in  anoxic  contaminated  environments.  Dojka  and 
coworkers  [14]  found  that  actinobacteria  constituted  0.5  % 
of the members of the bacterial domain in a hydrocarbon and 
solvent  contaminated  anoxic  aquifer.  Kasai  and  coworkers 
[15]  found  a  2  %  proportion  of  all  bacteria  to  belong  to  
actinobacteria  in  an  anoxic  soil.  To  our  knowledge,  no  
studies  of  contaminated  subsurface  so  far  have  included 
fungi in their community analyses. 

In the present study we  estimated  the biomass and  com-
 
position  of  micro-organisms  in  two  different  soil  profiles 
down  to  7  m  depth  originating  from  an  aged  contaminated 
soil  profile  that  was  contaminated  with  PHCs  and  a  clean 
soil profile next to the contaminated site. Special interest was 
paid  to  investigating  the  fungal  and  actinobacterial  commu-
nities since little is known about the role of these groups for 
in situ remediation of PHC contaminated subsurface soils. 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Soil Samples 

 
Soil samples were  taken from a closed landfill in South-
ern  Finland  where  PHC  containing  wastes  have  been 
dumped 30 years ago. The study area is known to be heavily 
contaminated  with  lightweight  fuel  and  lubrication  oils  in 
both  the  saturated  and  unsaturated  zone  and  partly  with 
heavy  metals  in  the  top  soil  [16].  Samples  were  taken  from 
two sampling points using a medium size drilling rig apply-
ing  the  core  sampler  technique.  The  soil  profile  from  the 

Björklöf et al. 

highly  contaminated  point  was  divided  into  0.5  m  subsam-
ples and the soil profile from a corresponding clean reference 
point  was  divided  into  1  m  subsamples.  The  samples  were 
sieved at the site with a 8 mm sieve, stored in glass jars and 
frozen  until  analysis.  The  dry  weights,  ignitions  losses  and 
mineral  soil  concentrations  were  determined  according  to 
[16].  The  oxygen  levels  at  the  sampling  points  were  meas-
ured  from  gas  monitoring  wells  situated  a  few  meters  from 
the sampling points.  

PLFA 

 
Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were extracted from 45 
g  of  soil  and  analysed  on  a  Perkin  Elmer  AutoSystem  XL 
gas chromatograph using the software TurboChrom (version 
6.1.1)  as  described  previously  [3].  Individual  fatty  acid 
methyl  esters  were  identified  using  a  pre-established  data 
base  [17]  and  quantified  by  means  of  an  internal  standard 
(nonadecanoate methyl ester 19:0).  

 
PLFAs representing bacterial biomasses were i15:0, 15.0, 
i16:0,  16:1(cid:1)7t,  i17:0,  a17:0,  17:0,  cy17:0,  18:1(cid:1)7  and 
cy19:0  [18].  Guilds  or  single  PLFAs  representative  of  spe-
cific  taxonomical  groups  were  treated  as  biomass  estimates 
using  the  fatty  acids  10Me17:0  and  10Me18:0  indicative  of 
actinomycetes,  18:2(cid:1)6  and  18:2(cid:1)9  indicative  of  fungi, 
cy17:0,  cy19:0  and  18:1(cid:1)7  for  Gram  negative  bacteria, 
i15:0,  a15:0,  i16:0,  i17:0  and  a17:0  for  Gram  positive  
bacteria,  and  16:1(cid:2)5  found  in  arbuscular  mycorrhizal  
fungi  and  certain  Gram  negative  bacteria  of  the  Cytophaga/ 
Flexibacter-group [19].  

 
Principal  component  analyses  (PCA)  on  the  PLFA  data 
were  performed  using  standardized  mol%  values.  The  tests 
were  carried  out  using  correlation  matrices  on  the  MatLab 
software (version 6, Mathworks, Inc., Natick, Ma, USA) and 
one way ANOVA  as well  as  Tukey's-b Post Hoc tests were 
performed by SPSS version 11.5.1. (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, 
USA).  

DNA Extraction, PCR and DGGE 

  DNA  was  extracted  from  soil  samples  with  the  Power-
Soil  DNA  isolation  kit  (Mo  Bio  Laboratories,  Inc.)  using 
0.25-0.3 g soil. DNA concentrations were determined by the 
Quant-iT™  PicoGreen  ®  dsDNA  Assay  kit.  Actinobacteria-
specific  16S  rDNA  primers  S-C-Act-235-a-S-20  and  S-C-
Act-878-a-A-19 were used [20]. For DGGE analysis the fol-
lowing  GC-clamp  was  added  to  the  S-C-Act-235-a-S-20 
primer:  5'-CGC  CCG  CCG  CGC  CCC  GCG  CCC  GGC 
CCG CCG CCC CCG CCC C -3' [21]. The final concentra-
tions  in  the  50  (cid:1)l  PCR  reactions  containing  1  (cid:1)l  template 
were 1 x Taq buffer containing (NH4)2SO4 (MBI Fermentas), 
500  μg  ml-1  BSA  (New  England  Biolabs),  2  mM  MgCl2 
(MBI Fermentas), 200 μM of each nucleotide (MBI Fermen-
tas),  200  nM  of  each  primer,  0.5  U  Taq  polymerase  (MBI 
Fermentas). After a first denaturing step (95°C 4 min) ampli-
fication  for  DGGE  analysis  was  performed  in  a  PTC-200 
Thermal Cycler (MJ Research) for 30 cycles in the following 
way; 95°C, 45 s; 59°C, 45 s; 72°C, 1 min and a final elonga-
tion step (72 °C, 5 min). The PCR product was 640 bp long. 
The annealing temperature was 66 °C for cloning. 
 
For  fungal  PCR  reactions  nested  primers  were  used.  In 
the first PCR reaction the 18S rDNA specific fungal primers 

Micro-Organisms in Subsurface Soil

nu-SSU-0817-5’ and nu-SSU-1536-3’ were used [22]. In the 
second  PCR  reaction  nu-SSU-0817-5’  and  nu-SSU-1196-3’ 
were  used  resulting  in  a  420  bp  long  product.  For  DGGE 
analysis  the following GC clamp was added to the nu-SSU-
1196-3’  primer:  5'-CGC  CCG  GGG  CGC  GCC  CCG  GGC 
GGG GCG GGG GCA CGG GGG G-3' [23]. The final con-
centrations  in the 50  (cid:1)l PCR reactions  containing 1  (cid:1)l  tem-
plate were 1 x Taq buffer containing KCl (MBI Fermentas), 
500  μg  ml-1  BSA  (New  England  Biolabs),  2.5  mM  MgCl2 
(MBI Fermentas), 250 μM of each nucleotide (MBI Fermen-
tas),  400  nM  of  each  primer,  0.5  U  Taq  polymerase  (MBI 
Fermentas) and 2 % formamide (BDH Laboratory Supplies). 
After a first denaturing step (94°C, 5 min) amplification was 
performed in a  PTC-200 Thermal  Cycler (MJ Research) for 
35  cycles  in  the  following  way;  94°C,  45  s;  50°C,  45  s; 
72°C, 1 min and a final elongation step (72°C, 5 min).  
  Denaturing  gradient  gel  electrophoresis  (DGGE)  was 
performed using the DcodeTM Universal  Mutation Detection 
System  (BIO-Rad,  Hercules,  CA,  USA),  using  6  %  (w/v) 
polyacryleamide  gels  in  0.5  x  TAE  (20  mM  Tris;  10  
mM  acetate,  0.5  mM  EDTA).  The  denaturing  gradient  was 
35-65  %  for  actinobacterial  DNAs  and  15-50  %  for  fungal 
DNAs.  On  top  of  the  gradient  gels  a  stacking  gel  without 
denaturant was added. A volume of 2-25 μl of samples were 
used.  Electrophoresis  was  run  for  at  150  V  for  10  min  fol-
lowed by 70 V for 18 h. Gels were stained with SYBR Green 
(Cambrex) for 30 min and the gels were photographed using 
the Bio-Rad Gel Doc 2000 equipment and the Quantity One 
-software  (Bio-Rad,  Hercules,  CA,  USA).  Each  band  in  the 
DNA profile was assumed to represent one microbial type.  

Genomic Libraries 

 
Samples  from  both  clean  and  contaminated  soil  profiles 
corresponding  the  soil  layers  with  highest  PHC  concentra-
tions in the contaminated profile were selected for more de-
tailed  studies  of  the  microbial  species  composition  using 
cloning  and  sequencing.  Cloning  was  performed  from  one 
parallel soil sample for Actinobacteria and two parallel sam-
ples  for  fungi.  Cloning  was  performed  using  the  pGEM®-T 
Easy Vector kit (Promega) and clones were grouped accord-
ing  to  their  restriction  fragment  length  polymorphism 
(RFLP)  using  the  HaeIII  and  Tru1I  restriction  enzymes  for 
actinobacteria  and  Tru1I  and  a  mixture  of  BcnI,  DpnI  and 
PdiI restriction enzymes (MBI Fermentas) for fungi. Actino-
bacterial  sequences  were  tested  against  chimeras  using  the 
Ribosomal  Database  Project  II  database  v  8.1  CHIMERA 
CHECK  -program  (http://rdp8.cme.msu.edu/cgis/chimera. 
cgi?su=SSU)  and  fungal  sequences  were  tested  against  
chimeras manually in the GenBank database. Selected clones 
representing  at  least  one  samples  from  the  different  RFLP 
groups  were  sequenced  at  the  Institute  of  Biotechnology 
(University  of  Helsinki,  Finland)  and  compared  to  known 
sequences  in  the  GenBank  database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/BLAST/). The partial rDNA sequences of all clones 
reposted  here  are  available  under  the  following  GenBank 
accession  numbers:  EU708341-EU708433.  Each  clone  was 
assumed  to  represent  one  single  operational  taxonomic  unit 
(OTU). Phylogenetic trees based on ME minimum evolution, 
were  composed  using  the  BioEdit  -program  (v.  7.0.4.1)  
[24]  and  the  PAUP*-program,  version  4.0,  beta  10  [25]. 
Rarefaction  analysis  of  the  clone  libraries  averaged  over  50 
simulations  were  performed  using  the  EstimatesWin800  

software  (version  8.0.0.,  http://viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/ 
estimates) [26]. 

RESULTS  

Characterization of the Soil Samples 

  The  measured  soil  parameters  of  the  soil  samples  in  the 
two  soil  profiles  are  presented  in  Table  1.  The  soils  were 
generally very dry, sandy soils with low organic matter con-
tents.  An  exception  was  the  contaminated  sample  at  the 
depth  of  3.0-3.8.m,  where  the  organic  matter  content  was 
40.6  %  and  the  dry  weight  was  only  47.6  %.  This  sample 
also had the highest PHC content, corresponding to 11 % of 
the organic matter content  in the sample.  The soil layer  im-
mediately  below  this  fraction  at  3.8-4.0  m  depth  contained 
no  PHCs.  This  sample  represented  a  clear  separate  20  cm 
soil layer that differed in color from the rest of the profile.  

  The  oxygen  concentration  in  the  contaminated  soil  pro-
file was reduced  already at less  than 1m below  the soil sur-
face  and  was  less  than  1  %  in  the  lower  soil  layers  where 
PHC  concentrations  were  highest  at  3-3.8  m.  In  layers  with 
reduced oxygen levels, carbon dioxide and methane concen-
trations were highly elevated (Table 1). The oxygen concen-
tration  was  only  slightly  reduced  below  4  m  depth  at  the 
clean  sampling  point  and  the  carbon  dioxide  concentration 
was  correspondingly  slightly  elevated.  No  methane  was  
detected in clean soils.  

Microbial Biomass in the Soil Profiles Based on PLFA 

  The  total  amount  of  PLFA  was  fairly  constant  in  the  
contaminated soil profile down to 6 m depth (180-340 nmol 
g-1 org matter), except for the layer at 0.5-1.0 m depth where 
620 nmol g-1 org matter was found, and  the  layer at 3.0-3.8 
m  depth  in  which  only  10  nmol  g-1  org  matter  was  found 
(Table  2).  The  clean  soil  profile  had  a  larger  microbial  
biomass  in  the  top  layer,  but  the  total  amount  of  PLFAs  
decreased  already  at  2  m  depth.  Bacterial  PLFAs  were  
between  4  and  320  nmol  g  organic  matter)-1,  corresponding 
to  bacterial  concentrations  from  3  x  108  bacterial  cells  
(g  organic  matter)-1  to  2  x  1010  bacterial  cells  (g  organic  
matter)-1  when  using  the  conversion  factor  1.4x10-17  mol 
PLFA  bacterial  cell-1  [18].  The  bacterial  biomass  at  depths 
below  2.0  m  was  about  5  times  higher  in  the  contaminated 
profile  compared  to  the  clean  profile,  except  for  the  layer  
3.0-3.8  m  in  the  contaminated  profile  where  the  bacterial 
biomass  was  very  low.  The  reason  for  this  low  value  is  
unclear;  it  could be a real value, or an artifact as  a result of 
inefficient PLFA extraction due to presence of high amounts 
of PHCs in this sample (40.6 % organic matter compared to 
the surrounding layers that had 0.9 and 0.3 % organic matter, 
see Table 1). The fungal biomass in the top layer was similar 
in  the  two  profiles,  47  nmol  g-1  organic  matter,  but  it  
decreased  more  rapidly  with  depth  in  the  clean  profile  
compared  to  the  contaminated  profile.  At  3-6  m  fungal 
PLFAs  were  frequently  detected  in  the  contaminated  soil 
profile. Similar as for the fungi, the actinobacterial indicator 
10Me18:0 was highest in the upper 2 m of both soil profiles 
and was only found in low amounts below 2.5 m (Table 2).  

 
Principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  based  on  mol%  of 
the  PLFAs  separated  the  samples  into  three  distinct  groups 
along the principal  component 1 (PC1), which explained 22

Fig.  (1).  Biplot  of  soil  samples  in  principal  component  analysis 
(PCA)  based  of  the  molar  ratios  (mol%)  of  PLFAs  from  the  
contaminated soil profile (filled symbols) and the clean soil profile 
(open  symbols).  Numbers  next  to  the  symbols  indicate  the  higher 
limit of the corresponding soil profile. (cid:1)  

  The  most  important  grouping  variables  for  principal 
component  1  (PC1)  were  the  PLFAs  cy17:0,  cy19:0  and  
18:1(cid:1)7,  indicative  of  Gram  negative  bacteria;  10Me18:0 
indicative of actinomycetes, and 18:2(cid:1)6  indicative of fungi, 
which were  all found at higher proportions in  the clean soil 
and  in  the  upper  part  of  the  contaminated  soil  whereas  the 
PLFAs 15:0, 14:0, a15:0, and 18:0 were found at higher pro-
portions in the lower layers of the contaminated soil (Fig. 2). 
Samples from the two lowest sampling layers (2.0-3.0 m and 
5.0-6.0  m)  from  the  clean  soil  grouped  separately  from  the 
rest  of  the  samples  according  to  principal  component  2 
(PC2). The mol% values of two of the four indicator PLFAs 
for  Gram  positive  bacteria  were  higher  in  the  deeper  layers 
compared to the upper layers of the contaminated soil profile 
(Table  3). The  mol% values of all four indicator PLFAs for 

Gram  negative  bacteria  were  lower  in  the  deeper  contami-
nated soil layers than in the upper soil layers of the contami-
nated soil profile. In the clean soil profile on the other hand, 
the  mol%  of  indicator  PLFAs  for  Gram  negative  bacteria 
increased with soil depth in three cases out of four. Although 
statistical differences between the upper (0-2.5 m) and lower 
(3.0-7.0  m)  are  scarce,  this  indicates  that  gram  positive  
bacteria  may  be  more  dominant  in  the  lower  soil  layers  of 
contaminated sites but probably not in clean subsurface soils. 

Microbial  Community  Composition  Based  on  Extracted 
DNA  

  DNA  was  extracted  from  the  four  uppermost  soil  layers 
of the two soil profiles. DNA levels were low in all samples 
and  decreased  with  depth,  corresponding  to  the  decrease  in 
microbial  numbers  indicated  by  PLFAs  (data  not  shown). 
The highest values were found in the most contaminated soil 
layer  at  the  depth  of  3.0-3.8  m  and  the  lowest  yield  in  the 
deepest soil sample of the clean soil.  

  The  actinobacterial  DGGE  profiles  were  different  in  the 
contaminated and the clean soil profiles. In both soil profiles, 
the  uppermost  soil  contained  most  bands;  approximately  25 
bands  were  detected  in  the  contaminated  soil  sample  and 
approximately 16 bands were detected in the clean soil sam-
ple (Fig. 3). The number of bands decreased with soil depth 
especially  in  the  contaminated  soil  profile.  On  the  other 
hand,  in  the  deepest  soil  sample  (3.0-3.8  m),  containing 
much organic matter and highest PHCs, but reduced oxygen, 
the number of bands was slightly higher than in the previous 
layer (2.0-2.5 m). In the clean soil profile, where the oxygen 
level did not decrease with depth, the decrease in number of 
bands  was  less  pronounced  (Fig.  3).  Actinobacterial  DGGE 
profiles from parallel DNA extractions were similar indicat-
ing  that  DNA  extraction  and  PCR  procedures  were  repro-
ducible. 

  The  number  of  bands  in  fungal  DGGE  profiles  did  not 
significantly  decrease  with  soil  depth  (Fig.  4).  To  our  sur-
prise, the parallels of the fungal DGGE profiles differed and

often  one  of  the  parallel  samples  contained  only  one  domi-
nating  band.  This  was  the  case  for  three  of  the  four  soil  
layers  studied  in  the  clean  soil.  In  the  contaminated  soil 
layer,  one  strong  band  appeared  in  one  of  the  parallels  at  
3.0-3.8 m depth but not in the other three soil depths studied.  

Species Composition of Soil Layers from a Depth of 4 m 

  Clone  libraries  were  constructed  from  samples  taken  
at  3-4  m  depth.  A  total  of  96  and  95  actinobacterial  clones 
were  selected  for  further  studies  from  the  contaminated  
and  clean  soil  layers,  respectively.  From  the  two  replicate 

Micro-Organisms in Subsurface Soil

fungal  clone  libraries  a  total  of  15  and  91  clones  from  the 
contaminated  soil  and  14  and  48  from  the  clean  soil  were 
selected.  The  clone  libraries  represented  by  only  14  or  15 
clones studied were derived from the fungal replicate sample 
A with only a few bands in the DGGE profile. The leveling 
off  of  the  rarefaction  curves  (plots  of  cumulative  number  
of  OTUs  as  a  function  of  a  clone  number)  indicate  that  the 
majority of the OTUs in the sample were represented in the 
clone libraries (Fig. 5).

over 50 simulations using the computer program EstimateS.  

  A total of 16 and 21 different actinobacterial OTUs were 
identified by RFLP and sequenced in the clean soil and con-
taminated  soil  samples,  respectively.  The  major  part  (90%) 
of the actinobacterial OTUs from the clean soil layer at 4 m 
matched only to uncultured bacteria or uncultured actinobac-
teria  and the match was often  less than 97% (Table  4). The 
three most frequently found OTUs, of which all were related 
to uncultured bacteria, represented 60 % of the clone library. 
Some of the OTUs from clean soil formed two phylogeneti-
cally  distinguished  groups  separate  from  any  reference 
OTUs  in  the  phylogenetic  tree  between  the  subclasses 
Coriobacteridae and Rubrobacteridae (Fig. 6). It is possible 
that  these  groups  of  actinobacteria  may  represent  new  sub-
classes.  Other  uncultured  OTUs  grouped  phylogenetically 
with  the  subclasses  Acidimicrobidae,  Actinobacteridae  and 
one OTU with  Gemmatimonadetes, which  is not  considered 
an actinobacterial group. The three clones related to Acidimi-
crobium may also represent a separate group of bacteria. The 
OTUs  from  the  contaminated  soil  all  grouped  with  the  sub-
class  Actinobacteridae  (Fig.  6).  Contrary  to  the  OTUs  in 
clean  subsurface  soil,  most  OTUs  at  the  contaminated  soil 
sample from the same depth matched cultured actinobacterial 
phyla. Six types of OTUs, of which only two matched uncul-
tured strains, represented 60 % of the clone library and 30 % 
of  the  clone  library  of  the  contaminated  sample  matched 
with Mycobacterium (Table 4).

Fig. (6). Phylogenetic tree of Actinobacterial OTUs as isolated from contaminated and clean soil samples from a depth of 4 m in relation to 
selected OTUs from Genbank (accession numbers of GenBank OTUs are indicated in brackets). OTUs are reported as Genbank accession 
numbers. Bootstrap values (%) are indicated for the branches which were similar in more than 50 % of the 1000 regenerated trees. 

  A total of 19 and 10 different fungal OTUs were identi-
fied by RFLP in the contaminated and the clean soil samples, 
respectively. From both fungal clone libraries B, which were 
expected  to  have  higher  diversity  based  on  DGGE  results, 
OTUs  grouped  phylogenetically  with  the  Ascomycota  and 
Basidiomycota  (Fig.  7).  The  RFLP  groups  detected  in  the 
clean  soil  sample  B  were  fewer  than  in  the  contaminated 
soil.  As  expected,  all  OTUs  in  the  contaminated  soil  and 

clean  soil  samples  A  represented  the  same  OTU  and  they 
matched  to  Acremonium  sp  and  Paecilomyces  sp  in  Gen-
Bank.  Phylogenetically  these  clones  were  closely  related 
(Fig.  7).  In  the  more  diverse  B  sample,  OTUs  relating  to 
Acremonium sp  and Paecilomyces sp was only found in the 
contaminated  soil,  where  it  represented  10  %  of  the  clone 
library.

DISCUSSION 

  Two different soil profiles down to the depth of 7 m were 
examined  in  this  study.  The  profiles  originated  from  a  30-
year-old site contaminated with PHCs  and from a  clean site 
next to the contaminated site. The concentration of oxygen in 
the  contaminated  soil  profile  was  strongly  reduced  in  soil 
layers below 1 m depth but not in the clean soil profile. The 
microbial  biomasses  based  on  bacterial  and  fungal  PLFAs 

varied  from  90-330  nmol  (g  organic  matter)-1  in  the  upper-
most 2 m of both soil profiles to less than 10 nmol (g organic 
matter)-1  in  the  lowest  part  of  the  clean  soil  profile.  This  is 
ten times less than have earlier been reported for top soils in 
forest soil [27] but similar  to subsoils (3-4 m) contaminated 
with benzotriazole [3]. At soil depths below 2 m  the micro-
bial PLFA concentrations in the contaminated soil was more 
than  5  times  higher  than  in  the  corresponding  clean  soil  
layers at the same depth, despite the fact that the availability 

84    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2009, Volume 3 

of  oxygen  was  very  low  in  the  contaminated  soil  profile. 
Bacterial  numbers  in  the  deepest  soil  layers  estimated  
based  on  the  PLFA  data  [18]  were  1.2  x  107  bacterial  cells  
(g  dry  weight)-1  or  3.1  x  109  bacterial  cells  (g  organic  
matter)-1 in the contaminated soil layer at 7 m and 3.3 x 106 
bacterial  cells  (g  dry  weight)-1  or  3.9  x  108  bacterial  cells  
(g  organic  matter)-1  in  the  clean  subsurface  soil  at  6  m.  
Information  on  bacterial  numbers  in  deep  subsurface  is 
scarce  but  recent  reports  indicate  that  bacterial  numbers  of 
specific groups in deep subsurface soils may be considerable 
[2]. The impact of  PHC as potential  carbon source explains 
the  larger  bacterial  numbers  in  the  anaerobic  contaminated 
soil compared to the clean soil [9].  

 
Principal  component  analysis  based  on  PLFA  data  (Fig. 
1)  demonstrated  that  the  microbial  community  composition 
in  the  clean  soil  profile  differed  from  that  of  the  contami-
nated  soil  profile  and  also  that  the  microbial  community  in 
the  upper  2.5  m  layers  of  the  contaminated  soil  profile  dif-
fered  from  the  lower  soil  layers.  This  grouping  cannot  only 
be due to the redox situation in the soil as oxygen depletion 
was  recorded  already  below  1  m.  Our  results  indicate  that 
Gram positive bacteria increased and Gram negative bacteria 
decreased with depth in the contaminated soil profile. Simi-
lar observations have earlier been reported several  times for 
the upper 2-3 m of soil profiles [9, 28, 29]. In both soil pro-
files,  the  amount  of  fungi  decreased  with  depth  but  in  con-
taminated  soil  fungal  PLFAs  were  detected  also  at  3-6  m 
depth. These results indicate that Gram positive bacteria may 
be  relevant  for  bioremediation  purposes  in  subsurface  soils. 
In the  clean soil profile, the Gram negative bacteria did not 
decrease  with  soil  depth  but  instead  increased  in  samples 
below 3 m. The reason for this remains unclear. The propor-
tion of actinobacteria found of in the present study (0-1 % of 
the total bacteria, based on PLFA values) was in accordance 
with  other  investigations  showing  similar  proportions  of 
actinobacterial  clones  in  clone  libraries  from  anoxic  con-
taminated subsurface [15, 30]. 

  The  composition  of  actinobacterial  communities  based 
on  rDNA  sequences  in  DGGE  analyses  were  surprisingly 
diverse in both subsoil profiles. It is possible that the limited 
oxygen  conditions  in  the  contaminated  profile  caused  the 
observed decrease in DGGE bands  at 1-3.8 m.  Many OTUs 
in the contaminated soil sample matched to  Mycobacterium. 
Mycobacterium strains may metabolize polyaromatic hydro-
carbons  (PAHs)  at  low  nutrient  conditions  [31]  and  their 
specific  genes  involved  in  n-alkane  degradation  have  been 
detected in contaminated Alpine soils [10]. In the clean soil 
profile  the  decrease  in  actinobacterial  OTUs  was  less  pro-
nounced. The actinobacterial community was different in the 
clean and the contaminated soil profile. It is especially note-
worthy that most of the actinobacterial OTUs detected in the 
clean soil at 3-4 m represent bacteria that have not been cul-
tured  and  that  some  of  these  seem  to  represent  new,  previ-
ously undescribed subclasses of Actinobacteria. Three of the 
isolated OTUs showed similarity to the subclass Acidimicro-
bidae, which also is a relatively unknown group, because of 
the small amount of isolates in this subclass [32]. It thus ap-
pears  that  there  was  an  uncharacterized  community  of  acti-
nobacteria  in  the  subsurface  which  may  be  unexploited  for 
different applications. 

Björklöf et al. 

  We  found  several  different  fungal  rDNA  sequences  in 
DGGE analyses  also  at  lower depths, both in  clean  soil and 
contaminated  soil  with  reduced  oxygen  concentrations.  The 
closest  matches  for  most  of  these  in  the  GenBank  database 
were only obtained to  the family  level or higher.  More  spe-
cific  taxonomic  grouping  was  not  achieved  for  most  of  the 
OTUs  because  they  matched  with  several  different  fungal 
groups  with  same  similarity  percentages.  The  18S  rDNA 
primers used in this study may not be specific enough to give 
a  better  distinction  and  inclusion  of  primers  for  ITS  se-
quences  could  have  given  more  specific  identification.  It  is 
interesting  that  often  one  dominating  group,  related  to  the 
Acremonium  sp.  and  Paecilomyces  sp.  was  found  both  in 
contaminated and in clean soil samples. A fungal isolate be-
longing to Acremonium sp. was recently found in Malaysian 
crude  oil  [33]  and  was  earlier  shown  to  degrade  hydrocar-
bons in batch cultures [34]. Contrary to the analyses of acti-
nobacterial DNA, the fungal replicate samples in the DGGE 
profiles did not show similar band patterns. The distribution 
of  fungal  species  in  soil  is  known  to  be  spatially  clustered 
leading  to  hot  spot  distributions  due  to  their  hyphal  growth 
[35]. It has been observed that small soil samples exhibited a 
larger  variation  in  fungal  community  composition  between 
replicas than larger soil samples [36]. It was concluded, that 
samples <1 g are convenient for obtaining reproducible bac-
terial fingerprinting, but samples of at least 1 g are required 
for obtaining reproducible fungal fingerprinting. 

  The  use  of  molecular  tools  for  characterization  of  the 
microbial community in subsoils enabled detection of groups 
of  micro-organisms  that  have  been  considered  to  be  strictly 
related  to  aerobic  environments.  Similar  observations  have 
been reported for aerobic fungi in anaerobic sediments [37]. 
The  use  of  specific  primers  for  the  actinobacteria  group  
allowed a better insight into which actinobacteria are present 
in  this  environment,  because  better  resolution  is  obtained 
than  when  using  general  bacterial  primers  as  in  most  other 
analyses of microbial community composition. The fact that 
many clones affiliated with mycobacteria were found in the 
contaminated subsurface could  suggest  that these organisms 
may  possess  an  unknown  ability  to  degrade  contaminants 
under  aerobic  or  microaerophilic  conditions.  The  methods 
used  here  do  not  distinguish  between  active  microbial  cells 
and cells that are in a resting stage. Both of the groups stud-
ied here, the Actinobacteria and the fungi, often form resting 
stages  like  spores  to  endure  unfavorable  environmental  
conditions.  Single  spore  cells  are  however  unlikely  to  be 
detected  with  these  methods,  because  several  copies  of  
the  target  DNA  is  usually  needed  for  detection  with  these 
methods in environmental samples. It should also be kept in 
mind that the microbial DNA profiles in the upper soil layers 
often differed from the microbial DNA profiles in lower soil 
levels. It is likely that some organisms establish more easily 
than  others  in  the  lower  layers,  thus  also  leading  to  differ-
ences  in  community  composition.  Therefore  the  upper  soil 
layer  is not  a likely a source for the  micro-organisms in the 
lower part of the soil profile. 

 
In this work we show that the cell number decreases with 
soil  depth  but  also  that  microbial  community  size  and  
species number (determined as OTUs) in soil layers below 2 
m are considerable both in clean and PHC contaminated soil

profiles.  It  is  well  known  that  the  amount  of  molecular 
markers  does  not  reflect  the  total  diversity  of  populations 
[38].  The  microbial  communities  differed  between  the  two 
very  different  subsurface  environments  and  they  differed 
also  with  depth.  Low  oxygen  concentration  and  high  PHC 
concentration did not restrain the diversity of these groups of 
micro-organisms at this 30-year-old contaminated site. In the 
clean soil profile, most of the actinobacterial OTUs matched 
to uncultured strains. Some of these OTUs might even repre-
sent  a  new  subclass  in  the  actinobacterial  phyla  reflecting 
that little is known about the whole microbial diversity in the 
biosphere.  The  metabolic  state  of  the  micro-organisms  
described in this work was not studied. More effort is needed 
to gain insight into the in situ activities of microbial commu-
nities in subsurface soils. The results indicate that fungi and 
actinobacteria  may  be  important  components  of  the  micro-
bial  communities  in  hydrocarbon  contaminated  and  oxygen 
limited  subsoils  and  more  knowledge  about  these  groups 
may help to develop more effective inocula to be used in soil 
bioremediation.  New  information  from  genomics  may  also 
help  to  reveal  if  actinobacteria  and  fungi  possess  hitherto 
unknown abilities to degrade contaminants.
