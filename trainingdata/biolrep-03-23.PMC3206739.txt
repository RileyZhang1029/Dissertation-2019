Abstract
Gout is a chronic arthritic disease associated with high levels of urate in blood. Recent advances in research
have permitted the identification of several new and common genetic factors underlying the disease.
Among them, a polymorphism in the ABC transporter gene ATP-binding cassette transporter isoform G2
has been highlighted. ATP-binding cassette transporter isoform G2 was found to be involved in renal urate
elimination, and the presence of the Q141K polymorphism to induce a 2-fold decrease in urate efflux. The
Q141K variant has been shown to have impaired trafficking, leading to its intracellular retention, whereas
the wild type protein is expressed on the cell surface. Several agents are being studied for the purpose of
improving folding, trafficking and function of various ABC transporters, including ATP-binding cassette
transporter isoform G2. If successful, this strategy opens doors to potential new therapies for gout.

Introduction
Gout is a common chronic form of arthritis reported to
afflict about 8.3 million people in the United States,
6.4 million in the European Union, and 2.9 million in
Japan in 2008 [1,2]. This disease is characterized by high
blood urate levels that provoke painful acute inflamma-
tory attacks. In recent years, efforts have been made to
determine the genetic causes of gout. Different polymorph-
isms have been identified as associated with elevated
serum urate levels and gout. Among them, a polymorph-
ism in the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 (ATP-
binding cassette transporter isoform G2), initially known
because of its involvement in chemotherapy drug efflux,
was highlighted. This review aims to discuss the genetic
causes of gout in the population, the association of the
ABCG2 C421A polymorphism with gout, and the char-
acterization of the ABCG2 variant protein in which a lysine
replaces a glutamine. We will address potential new treat-
ment strategies involving ABCG2 variant rescue.

Causes of hyperuricemia and gout
Gout is a progressive disorder caused by impaired urate
metabolism, leading to high serum urate levels (hyper-
uricemia) and the formation of urate crystals that

accumulate in joints. Although asymptomatic hyper-
uricemia is the precursor state to the development of
gout, many people with high serum urate never develop
gout,
the risk varying depending on the degree of
hyperuricemia.

Urate is the final metabolite of dietary and endogenous
purine metabolism. Food contains little urate, which is
mainly produced in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the
small intestine. A third of the urate is excreted via the
gastrointestinal tract, and two-thirds via the kidneys,
although 90% of urate filtered by the kidneys is reabsorbed
[3].

High serum urate levels and gout have been attributed
to different causal factors: genetics, nutrition, medication,
gender, age, and environment. About 90% of hyperur-
icemic individuals present with impaired renal urate
excretion while around 10% of them overproduce urate
[4]. Urate over-production can be due to acquired causes
such as eating purine-rich food, being overweight, fructose
ingestion, and alcohol intake—the latter two inducing
acceleration of ATP degradation to AMP, a precursor
of uric acid. Some diseases (i.e. myeloproliferative and

lymphoproliferative disorders, psoriasis, and hemolytic
anemia) are associated with enhanced turnover of nucleic
acid, which can also lead to hyperuricemia. The presence
of mutations in enzymes involved in purine metabolism
(i.e. hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase
deficiency and PRPP [phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate]
synthetase superactivity) have also been identified as rare
genetic causes of hyperuricemia and gout [3,4].

Multiple etiologies have also been described for urate
excretion failure. Hereditary renal disorders with rare
mutant alleles cause clinically distinct forms of familial
gout. For example, mutations in the uromodulin and renin
genes have been associated with hyperuricemia, gout, and
progressive renal failure. A mutation in the aldolase B gene
causes the recessive disease hereditary fructose intolerance
in patients, most of them also presenting hyperuricemia
and gout. Hypertension has also been described as a risk
factor for hyperuricemia or gout, partly due to decrea-
sed renal urate excretion. Diuretic use, lead exposure, and
cyclosporine immunosuppressive therapy also affect urate
renal excretion [3,4].

Other factors increase gout incidence. Men have a 2-fold
higher risk of gout compared to women, and those over
the age of 65 are the most affected population. People
who migrate to a westernized country have a higher risk
of developing gout than those who remain in their native
country, as do people who undergo westernization in
their country, due to changes in lifestyle and diet [5,6].

Genetic causes of gout
A genome-wide search for genes affecting serum uric acid
levels had demonstrated that the heritability of serum
urate levels is about 63% [7]. Until recently, our knowl-
edge of the genetics of gout was limited to the rare genetic
mutations discussed above. In the last few years, develop-
ment of new tools to investigate the human genome has
permitted important advances in our understanding of
disease. Among them, genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) are a recently developed research technique to
identify DNA polymorphisms distributed across different
large populations, and they permit the determination of
common genetic factors that influence health and disease.
Since 2008, different GWAS identified nine DNA loci asso-
ciated with serum urate concentration, with four linked to
gout in several populations [8-11]. These new data led
researchers to determine the function of genes associated
with the loci and their relationship with urate levels and
gout, along with the relevant single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) for each involved gene. The four loci
associated with gout all correspond to urate transporters
located in the epithelial cells of renal proximal tubules
(Figure 1).

The locus most strongly linked to gout corresponds to
the glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9), also known as the
solute carrier 2A9 (SLC2A9). In contrast to the three
other loci that are linked to an increased risk of gout,
several variants of GLUT9 are linked to a reduced risk.
The transporter is predominantly expressed in liver and
kidney but is also found in chondrocytes from human
cartilage, where,
in gout, urate is deposited. It was
initially identified as a glucose/fructose transporter [12],
then functional studies demonstrated that SLC2A9 was
also able to transport urate in renal reabsorption [13].
SLC2A9 exists as two isoforms that differ by the length of
their cytoplasmic domain and by their apical or
basolateral
localization in renal epithelial cells [14].
Several variants of SLC2A9 are associated with hypour-
icemia and a lower risk of gout [13,15]. It seems that
instead of impairing the protein function, the variants
might influence the relative expression level of the two
isoforms, leading to reduced reabsorption and increased
excretion of uric acid [13,15].

The second locus linked to gout corresponds to the gene
encoding the urate transporter 1, URAT1 (also named
solute carrier 22A12). The gene was cloned in 2002 and
immediately identified as a urate-organic anion exchan-
ger, re-absorption being triggered by high intracellular
loads of lactate and several other organic anions [16].
Localized in the apical membrane of kidney cells, URAT1
is one of the essential transporters involved in urate
reabsorption. URAT1 SNPs were first linked to hypour-
icemia [16,17]. Since then, several mutations in the
URAT1 gene have been linked to hyperuricemia and gout
in different populations [18-20], and a GWAS performed
in 2009 linked the locus to an increased risk of gout [9].
The molecular mechanism causing this urate level
increase has still not been elucidated.

The third locus linked to gout encodes the renal sodium
phosphate transport protein 1 (NPT1, or solute carrier
17A1), which is localized at the apical membrane of
renal proximal tubules. It was initially identified in 1993
as a sodium-phosphate cotransporter [21]. Following its
linkage to gout by GWAS [9], it was shown to also be a
voltage-driven urate transporter involved in urate secre-
tion [22]. The studied protein variant exhibited lower
urate transport activity compared with the wild-type
protein [22]. Then, several other SNPs in the NPT1 gene
were associated with increased risk of gout in humans
[23].

The last locus linked to gout corresponds to the ABCG2
gene, a transporter initially known for its involvement
in resistance to chemotherapy. We discuss below the
unexpected association between ABCG2 SNPs and gout.

Figure 1. Urate transporters in proximal tubule epithelial cells

Urate transporters are involved in both urate tubular secretion and postsecretory reabsorption, which determine the net urate excretion. In the urate
secretion mechanism, the anion transporters OAT1 and OAT3 (organic anion transporter 1 and 3), localized on the basolateral membrane, have been
shown to have the ability to transport urate depending on the gradients for exchanged anions. On the apical membrane, 4 transporters are involved in
secretion: UAT (uric acid transporter), NPT1 (sodium phosphate transport protein 1), and the ATP-binding cassette transporters MRP4 (multidrug
resistance related protein 4) and ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette transporter isoform G2). Various ABCG2 and NPT1 variants with impaired function
have been linked to increased risk of gout, and were described to decrease urate excretion, explaining the hyperuricemia. In renal reabsorption, the
apical urate-anion exchanger URAT1 is considered to be essential in urate homeostasis and has been estimated to be responsible for 50% of urate
reabsorption. OAT4 and OAT10 (organic anion transporter 4 and 10) are also apical mediators of this. In addition to these transporters, GLUT9
(glucose transporter 9) may play a dominant role in reabsorption. The short isoform, S-GLUT9, localizes exclusively to the apical membrane while the
long isoform, L-GLUT9, is thought to mediate basolateral efflux of urate. GLUT9 and URAT1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been
identified by GWAS to be significantly associated with decreased and increased risk of gout, respectively. While some GLUT9 SNPs would be linked to
the decrease in urate reabsorption leading to hypouricemia, the mechanism by which the URAT1 SNPs cause hyperuricemia and gout remains to be
elucidated.

As a transporter previously associated with multidrug
resistance, the identification of a physiological role for
ABCG2 has opened up new avenues in which this
protein could become an important target for clinical
therapy.

ABCG2 variants and their association with gout
in various populations
ABCG2 was identified as a new locus related to urate
levels and gout
from 2008 onwards [8,9]. GWAS
associated the missense ABCG2 C421A SNP (Q141K),

which replaces a glutamine with a lysine at amino acid
141, with elevated urate levels and gout
in both
Caucasian-Americans and African-Americans, with a
stronger effect in men than women [8]. It was also
established that the ABCG2 Q141K variant might be a
potential causal candidate for a 70% elevation in gout
risk. Six months later, another GWAS conducted from 14
studies in Europe confirmed the Q141K polymorphism
as a common variant associated with the disease [9]. The
C421A allele frequency is very high in the Japanese and
Chinese population (between 27 and 34%), while it is
approximately 10% for Caucasians and less than 5% in
the African population [24].

Following the linkage by GWAS, a functional assay was
performed to evaluate causality between gout and ABCG2
Q141K. The transporter had been previously shown to
be expressed in the human kidney proximal tubule apical
membrane [25]. In 2009, Woodward et al. [26] demon-
strated that ABCG2, already known as a xenobiotic efflux
pump, can also transport urate. Moreover, they observed
that the presence of the Q141K mutation reduced urate
transport by 54% compared with the wild-type form when
tested in Xenopus oocytes. They then showed a significant
association between gout and the SNP in an American
population-based study and determined that among the
Caucasian study participants, 10% of gout cases could be
attributed to the Q141K mutation.

A study conducted in a Japanese population highlighted
a second ABCG2 SNP strongly linked to gout [27].
C376T (Q126X) is a missense mutation encoding a stop
codon instead of a glutamine, which prevents the
expression of ABCG2. It was observed that, in patients
carrying the Q126X variant,
the risk of gout was
dramatically increased. A functional study also showed
that urate transport capacity was nearly eliminated in cells
transfected with the Q126X variant compared to those
with the wild-type protein, and confirmed that the Q141K
polymorphism halved urate efflux. A combination of
these two SNPs led to a more than 75% reduction of
protein function. Although this combination was found in
10% of gout patients involved in this study, the frequency
of the Q126X SNP only reaches 1–2% in the Asian
population and is not found in African and Caucasian
populations.

In 2010, two other studies were reported relating to the
C421A SNP and gout [28,29]. The first one, conducted
on a Chinese Han ethnic group, confirmed the associa-
tion between C421A polymorphism and the disease. The
second study was done in New Zealand, where gout rates
are high, and revealed an association between C421A
SNP and gout in New Zealand Caucasians and Pacific

Island populations, but not in the indigenous Maori
population, underlining sub-population differences.

ABCG2 C421A characterization
ABCG2 was described for the first time in 1998. It is a
member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
family. Its structure consists of one intracytoplasmic
ATP binding domain, followed by a six transmembrane
domain. ABCG2 is an energy-dependent efflux transporter
that must dimerize to function, and may exist as a tetramer
or higher order oligomer. It is mainly expressed in placenta
and hematopoietic stem cells, but is also found in the
brain, testis, uterus, digestive system, liver, kidneys, and the
mammary gland during lactation. It can transport numer-
ous chemotherapeutics, but also antivirals, antibiotics,
carcinogens and toxins out of the cell. Moreover, it has
been identified as a transporter of endogenous compounds
such as steroids, porphyrins, heme and vitamins in
different tissues. Likely physiological roles include control
of oral bioavailability, protection in the blood-brain and
maternal-fetal barrier, drug elimination, and normal stem
cell protection [30].

The C421A SNP leads to an amino-acid change localized
in the ATP-binding domain. The ATPase activity of the
variant protein is reduced by about 1.3- to 1.8-fold, along
with a reduction in its transport efficacy (compared with
that of the wild-type protein). Moreover, ABCG2 Q141K
protein expression is decreased 2-fold to 4-fold compared
with the wild-type, whereas the mRNA level is equal,
suggesting that the variant protein is unstable or degraded.
A decreased surface expression of the variant has also been
observed, coupled with incomplete trafficking to the cell
membrane in some studies. In vitro, cells harboring the
SNP are less resistant to ABCG2 substrate anticancer drugs
than cells bearing the wild-type protein. This correlates
with clinical studies showing that patients harboring the
Q141K polymorphism display reduced clearance of
substrate drugs, including anticancer drugs, antibiotics,
or cholesterol-lowering drugs [30,31].

Variant rescue by the pharmacological
chaperones
In recent years, it has been shown that the trafficking and
function of some ABC transporter variants can be rescued
by the use of pharmacological chaperones. These com-
pounds are small molecules that function much like
protein chaperones by promoting interactions between
protein domains during the folding process. This helps to
stabilize the protein by improving its folding, which results
in a recovery of the function originally lost due to mutation.

The efficacy of these pharmacological chaperones was
first demonstrated with rescue of the Y490 P-glycoprotein

mutant, which was retained in the endoplasmic reticu-
lum. The addition of a drug substrate improved the
targeting of neosynthetized protein to the cell surface in
an active conformation [32].

a long way from a clinical therapy, these experiments
could be extended to the Q141K variant to identify and
determine the ability of correctors and potentiators to
recover normal trafficking and function.

Since then, this method has been fruitfully tested in vitro
with the ABC transporter CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmem-
brane conductance regulator) and has gone on to yield
agents with activity in preclinical and clinical studies in
the treatment of cystic fibrosis lung disease. Indeed, cystic
fibrosis is caused by various mutations in CFTR, and the
use of the corrector VX-809 and the potentiator VX-770
enhance the function of the CFTR variants [33].

in vitro experiments showed that
In the same way,
mitoxantrone, an ABCG2 ligand, was able to improve
trafficking of an ABCG2 T402L-G406L-G410L mutant
that was misfolded and intracellularly retained [34]. As
illustrated in Figure 2, the ABCG2 mutant is partly
retained in the cytoplasm of the untreated cells while
24-hour treatment with mitoxantrone induces a relocali-
zation of the transporter mainly to the cell surface. While
recognizing that in vitro rescue is a simpler objective and

HEK293 cells transfected with the ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette
transporter isoform G2) T402L-G406L-G410L dimerization mutant were
submitted to 24-hour exposure of 5 µM mitoxantrone before indirect
immunostaining with the anti-ABCG2 antibody bxp21 according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Kamiya Biomedical, Seattle, WA), and DAPI
nuclear stain. An overlay of the two stains is shown by confocal microscopy
in the lower panels. Before treatment, the ABCG2 variant is partly retained
in the cytoplasm. Mitoxantrone rescued the trafficking defect of the variant,
leading to a significant increase in the amount of ABCG2 on the cell surface.

Conclusion: toward a new target for gout therapy?
Gout may not be curable, but it can be treated. Two
alternative treatments exist, according to the type of gout.
In the case of acute gout, anti-inflammatory drugs (includ-
ing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and
colchicine) are used to reduce the crystal-caused inflamma-
tion and ensuing pain. Chronic gout is treated with urate-
lowering medication, which aims to prevent gout attacks.
In this case, allopurinol (a xanthine-oxidase inhibitor)
decreases urate production whereas uricosuric agents, such
as probenecid and benzbromarone, are prescribed to in-
crease urate elimination [1].

However, among the 8 million gout-afflicted Americans,
conventional treatment is contraindicated or has been
ineffective for many patients. For example, it has been
recently shown in a clinical study that 35–40% of patients
had strong contraindications to multiple gout medications
[35]. The increasing understanding of the pathophysiology
of hyperuricemia and gout has led to a better comprehen-
sion of the failure of some therapeutics for patients with
difficult-to-treat gout. For example, the uricosuric agents
probenecid and benzbromarone, recently shown to inhibit
urate movement transduced by URAT1 and GLUT9, were
found to be ineffective in patients bearing a homozygous
loss-of-function mutation on URAT1 [17,36]. These newer
molecular insights offer the promise of adding to the
therapeutic armamentarium. The recent findings on the
role of the Q141K polymorphic ABCG2 in gout may open
the door to the use of a pharmacological chaperone
treatment for ABCG2 as a potential new target for gout
therapy.
