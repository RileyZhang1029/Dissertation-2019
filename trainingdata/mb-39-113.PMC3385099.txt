A  laboratory  experiment  was  conducted  to  study  the  induction  of  constricting  rings  and  test  predation  of  Dactylaria  bro-
chopaga  isolates  against  second  stage  juveniles  (J2s)  of  Meloidogyne  graminicola.  Among  the  five  fungal  isolates,  isolate  D
showed  the  greatest  number  of  predatory  rings  and,  consequently,  trapped  the  maximum  number  of  M.  graminicola  J2s
in  dual  cultures.  Another  pot  experiment  was  conducted  to  study  the  effect  of  D.  brochopaga  (isolate  D)  on  the  management
of  wheat  root-knot  disease.  Applying  a  mass  culture  (10 g/pot)  and  a  spore  suspension  of  the  fungus  with  and  without  cow
dung  manure  to  soil  infested  with  2,000  M.  graminicola  juveniles  significantly  improved  plant  height,  root  length,  weights
of  shoots,  roots,  panicles  and  grains  per  hill  compared  to  those  in  the  control.  Moreover,  the  fungus  significantly  reduced
the  number  of  root-knots,  the  number  of  egg  masses,  juveniles,  and  females  per  hill  compared  to  those  in  the  control.  Bio-
efficacy  of  the  fungus  was  heightened  when  the  mass  culture  and  a  spore  suspensions  were  used  in  combination  with  cow
dung  manure  to  improve  the  plant  growth  parameters  and  reduce  the  number  of  root-knot  and  reproductive  factors.  Further
investigations  should  be  conducted  to  identify  the  impact  of  this  fungus  in  the  field.

Meloidogyne  graminicola  is  one  of  the  most  economi-
cally  important  root-knot  nematodes  and  is  becoming  a
serious pest, particularly in rice-wheat cropping systems in
the  Indo-Gangetic  plains  of  South  Asia  and  rice  produc-
ing  areas  of  southeast  Asia  [1, 2].  In  India,  this  disease
was  first  reported  by  Israel  et  al.  [3],  and,  later,  the  dis-
ease  was  reported  from  different  states  by  many  scientists
viz.,  Andhra  Pradesh  [4],  Assam  [5],  Bihar  [6],  Haryana
[7], Tripura [8], Uttar Pradesh [9-11] and from West Bengal
[12].  M.  graminicola  is  a  well-established  pest  of  sandy
loam  to  loamy sand  soil  [2]  and  can  cause  yield  losses  of
20~80%  [13, 14].  However,  the  reduction  in  grain  yield
was up to 98% in pot experiments [15]. Soomro and Hague
[16]  reported  that  M.  graminicola  significantly  suppresses
root  growth  of  graminaceous  plants  such  as,  rice,  wheat,
sorghum, and Echinochloa colonum L. and that the amount
of damage varies with plant species. Moreover, this nema-
tode  can  survive  long  anoxic  periods  and  rapidly  rein-
vade  roots  when  soils  drain  [13, 17].  Soil  flooding  and
nematicides  are  two  of  the  most  effective  control  mea-
sures. Although nematicides provide immediate and effec-
tive  management  of  plant  parasitic  nematodes,  they  are
too  expensive  for  use  in  developing  countries  where  their

uses  are  limited  to  a  few  cash  crops  [18].  Concern  about
these chemicals has led to an increased interest in biologi-
cal  control  to  achieve  eco-friendly  methods  for  reducing
nematode damage.

Biological control using nematophagous fungi has been
investigated  for  the  effective  and  eco-friendly  management
of  plant  parasitic  nematodes  [19-31].  Furthermore,  apply-
ing  organic  manures  in  combination  with  nematophagous
fungi  stimulates  the  performance  of  these  fungi  and  results
in reducing the population of root-knot nematodes [21-26,
29].  However,  the  basic  mechanisms  behind  these  obser-
vations are unknown.

Dactylaria  brochopaga is  a predacious  fungus  that  dra-
matically  traps  and  kills  saprophytic  and  parasitic  nema-
todes in vivo and in vitro by producing three-celled trapping
rings  [1, 26, 28, 32, 33].  D.  brochopaga  is  a  common  fun-
gus in agricultural soils, decaying substrates and old-decayed
root-knots [23, 24, 28, 29, 32, 33]. The performance of this
fungus  for  reducing  the  number  of  root-galls  and  popula-
tions  of  M.  graminicola  and  M.  incognita  has  been
reported  by  Singh  et  al.  [28]  and  Kumar  and  Singh  [23],
respectively.  Five  D.  brochopaga  isolates  were  obtained
from  agricultural  soil,  leaf  litter,  and  decaying  root-galls

from  different  locations  in  India  and  were  tested  for  their
predation against second-stage juveniles (J2s) of M. gramini-
cola in vitro. Among the five isolates, isolate D of D. bro-
chopaga was  mass cultured on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor)
grains  and  tested  for  its  ability  to  control  root-knot  dis-
ease  in  wheat  (variety  Malviya-234)  in  a  pot  experiment.
The  observations  of  the  same  are  described  in  the  present
paper.

Materials  and  Methods

Isolation  and  maintenance  of  D.  brochopaga  and  col-
lection  of  M.  graminicola  J2s. Five  D.  brochopaga
isolates  were  obtained  from  different  agricultural  soils,
decaying  leaf  litter,  and  decaying  root-galls  from  different
locations  in  India  by  the  method  described  by  Dudding-
ton  [34]  with  a  slight  modification  by  Bandyopadhyay
and  Singh  [35].  All  five  D.  brochopaga  isolates  were
purified  by  single  spore  isolation  [36]  and  each  isolate
culture  was  maintained  at  29 ± 1oC  on  corn  meal  agar
(CMA) medium with regular subculturing at 15 day inter-
vals.  J2s  populations  of  M.  graminicola  were  obtained
from  rice  and  wheat  plant  pot  cultures  regularly  main-
tained  in  the  greenhouse  of  the  Department  of  Mycology
and  Plant  Pathology,  Institute  of  Agricultural  Sciences,
Banaras  Hindu  University  (BHU),  Varanasi.  A  sufficient
number  of  nematode  egg  masses  were  collected  from
root-knots  of  rice  and wheat  plants  and placed in  a cavity
block  for  hatching  at  room  temperature  (25~30oC)  for  2
days to obtain the required J2s population.

Predation  test. To  identify  the  response  of  the  five  D.
brochopaga  isolates  to  M.  graminicola  J2s,  observations
and  their  numbers  were  taken  when  constricting  rings
were  initiated  in  dual  cultures.  Numbers  of  constricting
rings per microscopic field (1.6 mm2) were noted daily for
6  days  under  a  microscope  at  ×10  magnification.  Several
observations  on  the  number  of  constricting  rings  were
made  from  center,  middle,  and  periphery  of  Petri  dishes
after  nematode  inoculation.  Observations  on  the  number
of  constricting  rings  formed  on  the  surface  and  deep  into
the  medium  were  also  made  at  24 hr  intervals  for  6  days,
and  the  average  number  of  induced  rings  was  calculated.
Three  Petri  dishes  were  used  as  replicates  for  each  fun-
gus  isolate-nematode  interaction.  Predation  of  the  five  D.
brochopaga  isolates  against  the  M.  graminicola  J2s  in
dual  cultures  was  tested  by  the  methods  described  by  den
Belder and Jansen [37]. A 5 mm fungal discs of each iso-
late  were  taken  from  the  periphery  of  10  day  old  cultures
and  transferred  to  50 mm  Petri  dishes  containing  solidi-
fied  CMA  (1 : 10)  medium  (0.2%  agar,  2 mm  thickness).
The fungal discs were placed upside down in the center of
the  Petri  dishes  containing  CMA.  The  Petri  dishes  were
incubated  at  28 ± 1oC  in  the  dark.  When  the  fungal  col-

ony  had  covered  the  plate  almost  to  the  edge,  the  fungal
discs  were  removed  aseptically.  A  drop  of  sterile  water
containing  50  nematodes  (thoroughly  rinsed)  was  poured
into  each  Petri  dish  with  the  aid  of  a  sterilized  dropper.
Petri  dishes  were  then  incubated  at  28 ± 1oC  for  observa-
tion. Similarly, data on captured nematodes were recorded
at  24 hr  intervals  for  6  days,  and  the  percentage  of  cap-
tured  nematodes  was  calculated.  Three  replications  were
maintained  for  each  treatment,  and  the  experiments  were
repeated three times.

Mass  culture. To  prepare  the  D.  brochopaga  mass  cul-
ture (isolate D), 20 g of sorghum grains were added sepa-
rately  to  a  250 mL  conical  flask  and  moistened  with
35 mL  of  water.  The  flasks  were  plugged  with  cotton  and
sterilized two times at 15 psi for 20 min. A 10 mm fungal
disc was cut from the periphery of the 10 day old D. bro-
chopaga  culture  with  a  sterilized  cork  borer  and  inocu-
lated into the center of the substrate contained in the flask
with  the  help  of  a  sterilized  inoculation  needle.  One  disc
was  inoculated  into  each  250 mL  conical  flask.  The  inoc-
ulated  flaks  were  incubated  at  room  temperature  (25~
30oC) for 25 to 30 days.

Performance  test  of  D.  brochopaga  mass  culture  and
spore  suspensions  against  wheat  root  knot  disease.
Nematode-infested  soil  containing  2,000  M.  graminicola
J2s  individuals  was  used  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  Dac-
tylaria  brochopaga  mass  culture  and  spore  suspensions
against  the  nematode.  The  experiment  was  conducted  in
the  wire  net  house  at  the  Department  of  Mycology  and
Plant  Pathology,  Institute  of  Agricultural  sciences,  BHU,
Varanasi.  Infested  soil  was  thoroughly  mixed  to  homoge-
nize  the  nematode  inoculums.  The  infested  soil  was  thor-
oughly  mixed  by  hand  to  create  a  uniform  population  of
nematodes before amendment. Mass culture was amended
at  the  rate  of  1%  (10 g/pot)  and  D.  brochopaga  containing
4 × 106  colony  forming  unit  (CFU).  The  spore  suspension
(undiluted)  and  diluted  spore  suspension  (10  times)  was
amended with or without 5% well decomposed cow dung
manure  (CDM).  The  mass  culture,  the  spore  suspension,
and  a  ten-fold  diluted  spore  suspension  with  and  without
CDM was uniformly mixed in the infested soil before fill-
ing  the  pots.  Root-knot  infested  soil  and  amended  soil
were  added  to  pots  (1,000 g/pot),  and  20  wheat  seeds
(variety Malviya-234) were sown in each pot on the same
day.  Five  replications  were  used  for  each  treatment.  Obser-
vations  on  the  number  of  root-knot  shoots,  root  length,
fresh  weight  of  the  shoots  and  roots,  panicle  length,  and
grain  weight  per  hill  were  recorded  after  the  wheat  plants
matured.  Also,  the  populations  of  eggs,  juveniles,  and
females were recorded. The number of females, egg masses
per root system, and J2s individuals were estimated by the
methods  described  by  Kumar  and  Singh  [25].  The  total

root  population  to  obtain  the  total  number  of  nematodes
present  in  the  soil  and  infected  roots.  Data  were  statistically
analyzed  using  an  analysis  of  variance.  Treatment  means
were compared by Duncan’s multiple range test [38].

Results  and  Discussion

The  formation  of  constricting  rings  and  predation  of  the
five D. brochopaga isolates against M. graminicola J2s in
a  dual  culture  were  studied  in  the  laboratory  (Figs.  1  and
2).  The  three-celled  constricting  rings  were  recorded  in
isolate  D  at  24 hr  after  the  nematodes  were  inoculated.
After  48  hr,  rings  had  formed  in  all  isolates.  The  number
of  rings  per  unit  area  increased  with  time.  Maximum  ring
induction  on  day  6  was  formed  in  isolate  D  followed  by
isolate  C,  whereas  a  minimum  number  of  induced  con-

stricting  rings  was  recorded  in  isolate  E  followed  by  iso-
late B. (Fig. 1). These results indicated significantly different
sensitivities  of  the  D.  brochopaga  isolates  for  ring  induc-
tion.  The  significant  variation  in  predation  of  the  five  D.
brochopaga  isolates  to  M.  graminicola  J2s  may  be  attrib-
uted  to  the  virulence  of  the  isolates  and  the  number  of
predatory  rings  formed  in  response  to  J2s.  Nematode  size
is  also  a  major  factor  for  predation  variation  of  preda-
cious  fungi  [23, 25, 26].  The  J2s  of  M.  graminicola  were
captured  in  dual  cultures  of  isolate  D  24 hr  after  nematode
inoculation.  After  48  hr,  nematodes  were  captured  by  the
constricting  rings  of  all  fungal  isolates.  The  maximum
percentage  of  nematodes  that  were  captured  was  recorded
for  isolate  D  followed  by  isolate  C,  whereas  the  mini-
mum  number  was  recorded  for  isolate  E  (Fig.  2).  Isolate
D  captured  and  killed  the  highest  number  M.  graminicola
J2s,  which  seemed  to  be  related  to  the  maximum  induc-
tion of rings in response to the nematode. The diameter of

the J2s was narrower, so they were easily captured by the
trapping  rings,  whose  internal  diameter  was  suitable  for
nematode  entry.  The  capturing  of  M.  graminicola  J2s
occurred  frequently  at  the  head  or  tail  region.  Trapping
rings  were  also  occasionally  seen  in  the  middle  of  the
nematode body.

Observations  on  the  effect  of  mass  culture  and  D.  bro-
chopaga  spore  suspensions  (isolate  D)  with  and  without
CDM  on  growth,  parameters  of  the  wheat  plant  and  the
reproduction  factors  are  presented  in  Table  1.  From  these
data, it was evident that all growth parameters of the wheat
plants were significantly enhanced when seeds were sown
in soil infested with 2,000 juveniles of M. graminicola per
“1,000 g,”  which  was  amended  with  a  mass  culture  or
spore  suspensions  of  the  fungus.  Moreover,  even  after
diluting  the  spore  suspension  of  the  D.  brochopaga  mass
culture,  the  plant  growth  parameters  were  enhanced  sig-
nificantly  more  than  those  of  the  control.  The  maximum
increase  in  growth  was  recorded  in  pots  treated  with  the
D.  brochopaga  mass  culture  and  CDM,  closely  followed
by  undiluted  and  diluted  spore  suspensions  with  CDM.
Applying diluted and undiluted spore suspension and mass
culture  without  CDM  reduced  the  number  of  root-knots  of
wheat  plants  by  25.64,  38.46,  and  46.15%  respectively,
whereas  diluted  and  undiluted  spore  suspensions  and  the
mass culture with CDM reduced root-knots by 51.28, 64.10,
and  71.79%,  respectively.  Similarly,  applying  diluted  and
undiluted  spore  suspensions  and  the  mass  culture  reduced
the  number  of  females  by  34.93,  49.34,  and  58.51%,  and
egg masses by 28.84, 37.68, and 47.89% and juveniles by
25.82, 40.55, and 56.64%, respectively. Performance of D.
brochopaga  isolate  D  as  a  nematode  antagonist  was
enhanced when diluted and undiluted spore suspensions and
the  mass  culture  were  applied  with  CDM,  which  reduced
the  number  of  females  by  50.65,  69.86,  and  73.36,  egg
masses  by  51.42,  71.29,  and  73.19%  and  juveniles  by
41.93, 78.79, and 83.36%, respectively.

The reduction in root-knot galling and reproductive fac-
tors  in  this  study  was  consistent  with  previously  obtained
results  for  this  fungus  [23].  The  enhanced  growth  of  the
wheat  plants  and  reduced  root-knots  and  populations  of
M.  graminicola  could  be  attributed  to  the  D.  brochopaga
spores  and  mycelia  [23].  Applying  D.  brochopaga  in
combination  with  CDM  saved  plants  by  capturing  and
killing  a  greater  number  of  (J2s)  of  M.  incognita  and  in
turn,  heightened  the  growth  parameters  due  to  a  greater
reduction  in  infection.  The  results  of  the  present  study
also  showed  that  the  spore  suspension  of  the  fungus
enhanced  plant  growth  and  reduced  the  root-knots  and
expression of the reproductive factors.

The  well-developed  roots  duly  protected  at  the  initial
stage by the capture and killing of nematodes by this fun-
gus  supported  plant  growth  and  the  reduction  in  the  M.
graminicola  population.  These  findings  are  more  or  less

similar  to  Stirling  et  al.  [31],  who  reported  that  A.  dacty-
loides  caused  a  57~96%  reduction  in  the  number  of  root-
knots  and  a  75~80%  reduction  in  the  number  of  nema-
todes  per  tomato  plant  in  pots  and  field  experiments,
respectively.  The  other  possibility  for  the  increased  effect
of D. brochopaga may be due to an increase in the popu-
lation  of  saprophytic  nematodes,  which  after  their  capture
and killing possibly increased the fungal population. Nota-
bly,  plant  growth  increased  conspicuously  with  better  root
system in pots treated with the fungus and CDM. Recently,
Kumar  and  Singh  [23]  reported  that  this  fungus  reduces
the  root  knots  of  eggplant  by  31.1~57.9%,  females  by
24.2~49.9%, egg masses by 22.1~42.9%, and juveniles by
30.8~60.7%  and  further  enhanced  plant  growth  in  pot
experiments. Furthermore, the effect of D. brochopaga was
enhanced  when  the  fungus  was  applied  in  combination
with  CDM.  The  results  of  this  study  suggest  that  preda-
cious  fungi  are  very  useful  for  managing  root-knot  dis-
ease  of  wheat  and  rice,  and  that  D.  brochopaga  is  an
efficient  agent  for  the  biocontrol  of  M.  graminicola.  This
fungus  should  be  applied  in  combination  with  CDM  to
infested  soil  so  that  it  can  proliferate  sufficiently  in  the
soil for better control. Further studies are needed to under-
stand  the  mode  of  action  and  mechanisms  of  this  fungus
Moreover,  investigations  should  also  be  conducted  to
identify the impact of this fungus in the field.
