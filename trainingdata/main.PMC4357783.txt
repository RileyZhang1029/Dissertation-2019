Titulaer *  Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, 1100 DD Amsterdam, The Netherlands  Received 30 November 2012  revised 21 February 2013  accepted 28 February 2013 Available online 2 April 2013  KEYWORDS  Orbitrap  Mass spectrometry  Peptide proﬁling  Biomarkers  Glioma  Abstract Candidate protein biomarker discovery by full automatic integration of Orbitrap full MS1 spectral peptide proﬁling and X!Tandem MS2 peptide sequencing is investigated by analyzing mass spectra from brain tumor samples using Peptrix.
Potential protein candidate biomarkers found for angiogenesis are compared with those previously reported in the literature and obtained from previous Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) peptide proﬁling.
Lower mass accuracy of peptide masses measured by Orbitrap compared to those measured by FT-ICR is com- pensated by the larger number of detected masses separated by liquid chromatography (LC), which can be directly linked to protein identiﬁcations.
The number of peptide sequences divided by the number of unique sequences is 9248/6911   1.3.
Peptide sequences appear 1.3 times redundant per up-regulated protein on average in the peptide proﬁle matrix, and do not seem always up-reg- ulated due to tailing in LC retention time (40%), modiﬁcations (40%) and mass determination errors (20%).
Signiﬁcantly up-regulated proteins found by integration of X!Tandem are described in the literature as tumor markers and some are linked to angiogenesis.
New potential biomarkers are found, but need to be validated independently.
Eventually more proteins could be found by actively involving MS2 sequence information in the creation of the MS1 peptide proﬁle matrix.

A comparable instrument, the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer, has a slightly better mass accuracy of 6 1 ppm [1].
However, the per- formance of FT-ICR depends on the magnet strength chosen, e.g., 9.4 T, and thus it takes up a lot more space because of the sizeable magnet.
Orbitrap has a shorter time scale of measur- ing than FT-ICR and can therefore be more conveniently linked to a nano-LC column to measure peptide fractions of a trypsin-digested sample.
Comparison of mass spectra from different samples is called peptide proﬁling.
Peptide proﬁling creates a matrix of  1672-0229/$ - see front matter ª 2013 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of China.

There are a number of open-source software applications for comparing Orbitrap mass spectra from large numbers of samples in different groups [3 5].
Open-source software applications running on Windows operating system (OS), which combine the full spec- tral MS1 peptide masses and protein identiﬁcations by frag- mentation of peptide masses (MS2 or MS/MS), are scarce.
A few such examples are MsInspect, MSight, MSQuant and MaxQuant [3 6].
The majority of open-source packages use commercial search engines such as Mascot and Sequest to cor- relate MS2 fragmentation spectra with proteins in *.fasta dat- abases, such as MSQuant and the early version of MaxQuant [4,6,7].
Other open-source software packages that compare  MS1 spectra from various samples with each other can only be installed on the Linux OS [5].
There are applications which use statistics to ﬁrst determine differentially expressed MS1 peptide masses between the samples [8].
The masses that are differentially expressed with peak intensities in the groups are linked to a protein using MS2 fragmentation spectra.
Some applications determine relative quantities of a protein between samples on the basis of the number of times that a protein s peptide sequence is detected in an MS2 scan in a nano-LC Orbitrap measurement.
For example, in MaxQuant [7], for label-free quantiﬁcation, the maximum number of pep- tides between any two samples is compared, resulting in a ma- trix of protein ratios.
There are a number of drawbacks associated with this spectral count technique.

The underlined proteins are also up-regulated in GT compared to NT.
and therefore protein identiﬁcation is measured relatively less often for peptide masses with a low intensity in the MS1 spectrum [3].
The Xcalibur instrument software uses exclusion criteria in a nano-LC MS measurement to exclude selected MS1 parent masses for MS2 fragmentation in order to obtain as many protein identiﬁcations as possible (www.thermoscientiﬁc.com).
Performance of Peptrix was compared with that of MsIn- spect [2] and the results were remarkably different, since the software applications differ greatly in their techniques for pro- cessing the mass spectra.
Peptrix runs on an average computer system with the Windows OS.
Peptrix is written in Java and uses around 1 GB of memory with a maximum memory heap size,   Xmx1024 M, setting of the Java executable.
Peptrix does not use any statistics to make the peptide proﬁle matrix [1].
Peptrix uses the freely available MS2 sequencing applica- tion X!Tandem (http://www.thegpm.org/tandem/) [9] for link- ing the protein identiﬁcations through MS2 peptide sequences to the MS1 peptide masses.
The interesting points and results from this new link will be discussed.
Gliomas are among the most vascularized tumors.
There- fore, identiﬁcation of new angiogenesis-related proteins is important for the development of anti-angiogenic therapies [10].
A glioma type brain tumor dataset containing glioma and endometrium control samples is analyzed using Peptrix in this study.
To discriminate between physiological and pathological angiogenesis, protein expression proﬁles of proliferating vessels in glioma are compared with those of endometrium tissue where physiological angiogenesis takes place.
The potential protein biomarkers for glioma angiogenesis obtained are compared with proteins that have previously been reported in the literature [11 16].
The Orbitrap analysis results are also compared with FT-ICR MS analysis results from a comparable sample set [1].
Results  Peptrix performance  The processing of the 40 mass spectra in a peptide proﬁle ma- trix shown in Figure 1 takes a total of 70.5 or 1.75 h per ﬁle on average.
A peptide proﬁle matrix for peptide masses with a se- quence and protein label, and the average peak intensities of the masses in the spectra for the groups GV, GT, NV and NT are created.
The peptide proﬁle matrix consists of 24,249 mass-retention time bins, of which 9248 (38%) have a sequence  and protein label.
A large part of the low intensity peptide masses in the MS1 spectra is not selected for MS2 sequencing or sequencing is not successful.
Among the 24,249 peptides, 52% are up-regulated with intensity ratio GV/NV   1 (+), and 48% were down-regulated with intensity ratio GV/ NV   1 ( ).
The instrumental coefﬁcient of variance (CV) of the Orbi- trap mass spectrometer is 10% for measurements of high intensity peaks of technical replicates [2].
When working with peak lists, peak ﬁnding and matching low intensity peaks in- crease the CV.
The average CV of measured peak intensities of technical replicates is 25% for Peptrix [2].
The biological variability of peak intensities is large.
The CV of peak intensi- ties when measured for all samples of a group, 7350 times in the 24,249 mass retention time bins of the peptide proﬁle ma- trix, is about 100% of the mean intensity.
A small selection of proteins that have differentially ex- pressed peptide peak intensities between GV and NV is shown in Table 1.
The average spectrum peak intensities for the pep- tide masses for myosin-9 in the four groups examined are shown in Table S1.
The average mass accuracy of all identiﬁed peptide masses was 4 ppm compared to the calculated value.
The Orbitrap peptide masses are approximately less accurate by a factor of 4 7 than those measured with FT-ICR MS.
The number of unique sequences is 6911 in the Orbitrap peptide proﬁle matrix, which means that sequences appear redundant 1.3 times on average in the matrix.
The number of peptide sequences divided by the number of unique se- quences is 9248/6911   1.3.
Majority of the sequences appear once (about 85%) or twice (about 10%), while some sequences appear three times (about 4%) or more (about 1%) (Tables 1 and S1).
There are three reasons why peptide sequences appear in the peptide proﬁle matrix more than once.
Firstly, in approx- imately 40% of cases, the repetition of the sequences is caused by tailing possibly combined with mismatching of the peptide mass with other masses in the elution proﬁle for the nano-LC.
For example, the sequence FSVNLDVK for protein CRY- AB_HUMAN (alpha-crystallin B chain) shown twice with a difference in retention time binning of 1408 s (7157   5749 s), which is  300 s (5 min) (Table 1).
Another example is the peptide mass with the sequence IAQLEEQLD- NETK for myosin-9 in Table S1.
The difference in retention time between two bins is 1357 s (7199   5842 s), which is  300 s (5 min) too.
Secondly, in approximately 40% of cases, the sequence is present more often in the peptide proﬁle matrix  is   Titulaer MK / Integration Peptide Proﬁling and MS2 Sequencing  191  through mass modiﬁcations of the peptide.
The sequence QEEEMMAKEEELVK for myosin-9 is present in three mass retention time bins in Table S1, i.e., with mass 1705.7642, 1721.7544 and 1722.7951 Da.
The mass of the peptide without modiﬁcation is 1722.7951 Da.
The ﬁrst modiﬁcation of peptide with mass 1705.7642 Da is an N-terminal loss of NH3 with  17.0265 Da and cyclization of glutamine (Q) [17], while the second modiﬁcation of peptide with mass 1721.7544 Da is an ex- tra oxidation of methionine (M), which leads to an increase of the mass by 15.999 Da (net change 15.999 17.0265    1 Da).
Finally, in approximately 20% of cases, the sequence is mea- sured more often because of faults in the determinations or mis- matching of the masses of the peptides.
The mass difference is slightly greater than 10 ppm and the peptide appears in a differ- ent mass retention time bin in the matrix, while it should be pres- ent in one bin.
The peptide with sequence YSVQTADHR for fascin (Table 1) is such an example.
The difference in mass is 17 ppm ( 10 ppm binning), while the retention time binning i.e., the bins differ by is not more than 5 min different, 5880   5760 = 120 s.  The number of unique proteins linked to the peptide proﬁle matrix is 1873.
Each protein is identiﬁed with approximately 4 (6911/1873) unique peptide sequences.
The MS2 protein labels from the peak lists from the individual samples are currently passively matched with the MS1 peptide proﬁle matrix in the last step of the process shown in Figure 1.
The number of un- ique peptide sequences in the peak lists from the individual samples is 10,259 and the number of protein labels is 2569.
The peptide proﬁle matrix has approximately 67% (6911/ 10,259) of the peptide sequence and 73% (1873/2569) of the protein information from the peak lists from the individual samples.
Modiﬁcations detected by X!Tandem  Compared to the commercial search engine Mascot, the search engine X!Tandem detects a large number of non-tryptic pep- tide fragments due to a different search algorithm employed, approximately 11% of the total (Tables 1 and S1).
Two such examples are the sequence DYEEVGVDSVEGEGEEEGEE from tubulin alpha-1A chain split at EY (Table 1) and the se- quence KTELEDTLDSTAAQQELR from myosin-9 split at LK in Table S1.
Approximately 20% of the sequences have a modiﬁcation (Tables 1 and S1).
In approximately 1/3 of the cases, this in- volves an N-terminal loss of  NH3 and cyclization of Q for  17.0265 Da, while in approximately 1/3 of the cases, oxidation of M (+O) adds +15.999 Da.
In addition, in approximately 1/4 of the cases there occurs deamidation ( NH2 + OH) of aspar- agine (N) or Q to increase +0.984 Da, and in some cases (the remaining approximately 1/10), acetylation (+COCH2) of M or alanine (A) confers an augmentation of +42.0106 Da.
An N-terminal loss of  NH3 and Q cyclization increases the hydrophobicity of the peptide.
Consequently, the retention time of the peptide masses clearly increases by approximately 2200 s (36 min) through this N-terminal loss [17].
For peptide with sequence QAQQERDELADEIANSSGK from myosin-9, the increased retention time is 7610   5496 = 2114 s and 7610   5363 = 2247 s (Table S1).
There are two different val- ues due to binning (errors), since the retention times 5496 and 5363 should have been in one mass-retention time bin.
From all observed modiﬁcations, only M oxidation is given as an input variable in the graphical user interface (GUI) of Peptrix.
Peptrix stores the modiﬁcations in the ﬁle default_in- put.xml used by tandem.exe (Figure 1).
The other modiﬁca- tions are detected by X!Tandem as standard, when the template default_input.xml is used, which can be downloaded together with tandem.exe in the distribution of X!Tandem.
The default_input.xml can be changed according to personal needs.
The modiﬁcations including N-terminal loss of ammo- nia and Q cyclization, oxidation of M, acetylation of M or A, as well as which amino acid this concerns, are reported in the ﬁle output.xml (Figure 1).
The deamidation of N or Q is not detected as such, but is reported as an increase of mass of approximately 1 Da, compared to the theoretical mass.
Selection of candidate biomarkers for glioma angiogenesis  Candidate biomarkers for glioma angiogenesis (Table S2) are selected from the peptide proﬁle matrix based on the following criteria: (1) at least two unique peptide sequences are up-regu- lated in the GV versus NV group with intensity ratio GV/ NV   1 (+).
This results in 597 protein labels, which are about 32% of the total number of 1873 protein labels  (2) no more than 1 of 6 sequences exclusively down regulated for each protein ( ), this is 17% of the peptide sequences for each pro- tein.
This results in 328 protein labels, which are about 18% of the total number of protein labels  (3) at least one or preferably more peptides with a Wilcoxon Mann Whitney P va- lue   0.1.
This results in 235 protein labels (Table S2), which are about 13% of the total number of protein labels.
Apparent down-regulated peptide masses with intensity GV   NV ( ) due to tailing in retention time are not consid- ered.
In most cases, the peptides of proteins that are up-regu- lated in GV are also up-regulated with peak intensities GV   NV (+).
For some sequences of peptide masses in Ta- ble 1, a different pattern can be observed with peptide peak intensity GV   NV ( ).
This usually concerns sequences that appear more than once in the peptide proﬁle matrix through tailing of the peptide mass in the elution proﬁle from LC, mod- iﬁcations of the peptide or errors in determining the mass.
Such examples include the sequences YSVQTADHR from fas- cin, LTNSQNFDEYMK from fatty acid-binding protein, brain, LGVRPSQGGEAPR and SYTITGLQPGTDYK from ﬁbronectin and LDHKFDLMYAKR from tubulin alpha-1A chain.
Proteins can be selected from the list of 235 up-regulated protein labels (Table S2) and proteins that were previously named in the literature as a tumor biomarker or linked with angiogenesis [1,10 16] are displayed in bold in Table 2.
The up-regulated proteins in GV were classiﬁed according to a scheme set-up [15] and information provided at www.uni- prot.org.
As presented in Table 2, a large number of proteins are cytoskeleton proteins, involved in cell migration and cell shape or cross linking of actin [1] in bundles, the ﬁlopodia [18], such as fascin, cell division control protein 42 homolog and spectrin beta chain, brain 1.
Fibronectin (Table 2) is an example of the KEGG hsa04512 ECM receptor interaction pathway, connecting with cell surface protein integrins, regu- lating cell-to-ECM and cell-to-cell adhesion.
Other members of this pathway including agrin, integrin, laminin, tenascin [10,12,14,15] are also listed in Table 2.
192  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 182 194  New potential biomarkers for glioma angiogenesis can be se- lected from the list of up-regulated proteins in Table 2, but need to be validated independently.
For example, clusterin was previ- ously reported to be related to multiple sclerosis [19], while excit- atory amino acid transporter 1 is perhaps associated with the glutamate dehydrogenase 1, mitochondrial (Accession No.
P00367, Table S2) [10,11], since both glutamate transporters and glutamate dehydrogenase play roles in the developing brain [20].
In addition, 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase is an exam- ple of a candidate involved in the lipid and fatty acid metabolic process and regulation.
It is interesting to note that angiogenesis and metastasis are reduced by the inhibition of fatty acid syn- thase with the anti obesity drug Orlistat [21].
In the previous study, the comparison of GT and NT also shows a sharp skewed distribution toward low Wilcoxon  Mann Whitney P values [2].
A large number of peptides are differentially expressed between GT and NT.
These proteins are underlined in Table 2.
69 of the selected 235 protein labels (29%) appear also up-regulated in GT, compared to NT.
Dif- ferences observed between GV and GT are not presented in Table 2, while no signiﬁcant differences appear between NV and NT at all [2].
The candidate biomarker Cdc42 effector protein 3 [1] is not found in the peptide proﬁle matrix.
Peptide sequences from Cdc42 effector protein 4 (B3KUS7) are however deﬁned in the peak lists of GV.
The peak intensity of a peptide mass with se- quence TPFLLVGTQIDLR from a related protein Cdc42 homolog (E7ETU3) is up-regulated in GV compared to NV with a factor of 17.2 (Table 1).
Myosin-9 [15] is also not present in the list of selected candidates.
The considerably lower Wilco- xon Mann Whitney P values and greater intensity ratios GV/ NV measured by FT-ICR [1] are not observed in the present analysis.
The Wilcoxon Mann Whitney P values between GV and NV of peptide masses (marked with * in Table S1) remain constantly high at about 0.6 from position 712 up to position 1755 of the primary structure of myosin-9.
In addition, annexin A5 [1,12,14] is up-regulated in GV compared to NV, but absent from the list of selected candidates in Table 2, due to lack of pep- tide mass with Wilcoxon Mann Whitney P value   0.1.
Dif- ferent from an earlier ﬁnding [1], desmin (Swiss-Prot Accession code P17661) does not appear to be up-regulated in GV compared to NV, but is instead down-regulated ( ) as re- ported in another study [15].
The down regulation of desmin could be attributed to the use of a different control sample set, proliferating endometrium (representing physiological angio- genesis) instead of the normal control hemispheric brain used in the FT-ICR study.
Even so, desmin is related to angiogenic micro vessels and is localized together with vimentin, a marker for pericytes [15,22].
Estimation of the FDR  The false discovery rate (FDR) of a protein is estimated based on how many single peptides of the protein are up- or down regulated.
All proteins mentioned in Table S2 are taken up-regulated and the majority of the proteins have been reported to be asso- ciated with tumor growth in the literature (Table 2).
The 235 protein labels represent 2133 mass intensity bins in the peptide proﬁle matrix (Table S2), from which 312 appear down- regulated ( ) in GV versus NV group.
The chance of having  a single peptide measured as down-regulated by mistake is esti- mated as 0.15 (312/2133) for an assumed up-regulated protein.
Since approximately half of the peptides are either up-reg- ulated or down-regulated in the peptide proﬁle matrix, the FDR is therefore set as 0.15.
The FDR of protein with two po- sitive (+) peptides is 0.02.
The FDR of fascin (Table 1) found with 5 positive (+) and one negative ( ) peptide for example is 0.0004 [(0.15)5   (0.85)   6!/(5!
1!)].
Discussion  Peptrix implements the MS2 sequencing application X!Tan- dem and detects label-free differentially expressed candidate biomarkers for angiogenesis in a small dataset, by comparing the average peak intensities in combination with the non-para- metric Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test.
In this way, Peptrix is capable of detecting meaningful biomarkers, despite the large biological variability of peak intensities and zero values (pep- tide peak intensity is below detection limit or peak detection fails).
As a result, biomarkers that have been reported previ- ously in the literature are identiﬁed.
Peptide proﬁling from Orbitrapä MS ﬁles results in less pro- nounced intensity ratios between GV and NV than with previous FT-ICR measurements.
There is therefore no sign (Table S1) of the supposed up-regulation of peptide masses on the C-terminus of myosin-9 [1].
The level of up-regulation can now be determined with peptide masses at more positions in the protein, because more peptide masses are measured from myosin-9 through LC separa- tion than those measured by FT-ICR.
The lower mass accuracy of Orbitrapä MS compared to FT- ICR MS is compensated by greater number of masses and pro- tein identiﬁcations, which can be directly linked to the peptide proﬁle matrix.
Through LC separation, the Orbitrapä peptide proﬁle matrix contains approximately 10 times more bins (24,249/2275) than the FT-ICR peptide proﬁle matrix obtained from a comparable dataset.
The signal is averaged over more MS1 measurements than with FT-ICR MS as well.
A distorted image of up- or down-regulated peptide masses from a protein is however sometimes created through tailing, modiﬁcations, incorrectly-determined masses and mismatching.
Peptide masses from up-regulated protein intensity GV   NV (+) in some mass retention time bins can appear down-regu- lated with intensity GV   NV ( ).
The peptide matrix contains approximately 70% of the MS2 labels of the individual peak lists together.
Loss of MS2 sequencing information occurs when matching the individual peak lists in the last step of the creation of the peptide proﬁle matrix (Figure 1).
It is therefore important not to match the MS2 sequencing information passively, but to actively involve it in the creation of the matrix, so that all MS2 sequencing information is retained.
This active matching should be implemented while retaining maximal speed of Peptrix and the minimal memory usage of the work station.
Materials and methods  Dataset  A glioma type brain tumor dataset containing glioma and endometrium control samples is analyzed in this study.
The dataset consists of 10 micro-dissected tissue samples from   Titulaer MK / Integration Peptide Proﬁling and MS2 Sequencing  193  glioma blood vessels (GV), 10 from tissue around these blood vessels (GT), 10 from normal endometrium blood vessels (NV), and 10 from endometrium tissue around these blood vessels (NT).
The origins and preparation of the micro-dis- sected tissue samples are described in [10].
In the present anal- ysis, NV and NT of proliferating endometrium (representing physiological angiogenesis) are used as control samples [10], whereas normal control hemispheric brain samples were used in the FT-ICR study [1,16].
Peptrix label-free peptide proﬁling software  The Orbitrapä MS measurements are described previously in [2,10].
Forty *.RAW ﬁles exported by the Xcalibur instrument software with an average size of 523 MB are imported in Pep- trix for analysis.
The Peptrix architecture is described in [23].
The imported *.RAW ﬁles are saved on an FTP server.
Re- cords with the ﬁle names of these *.RAW are created in the Table Sample in a MySQL database (Supplementary File 1).
The ﬁles are assigned to GV, GT, NV or NT group, respec- tively, in the Java Swing graphic user interface (GUI) of Pep- trix.
The links between ﬁle name and group code are saved as records in the table Results of the MySQL database (Supple- mentary File 1).
The mass and retention time window for bin- ning the peptide masses in the peptide proﬁle matrix, which is set as 10 ppm and 5 min, respectively, are entered in the GUI.
The expected modiﬁcations of the peptide masses can also be entered.
Only the (ﬁxed) modiﬁcation carbamidomethyl cys- teine (C), mass + C2H3NO 57.022 Da, and (variable) oxida- tion of M, mass + O 15.999 Da, are currently implemented.
The precursor mass tolerance of the parent peptide and MS2 fragment mass tolerance, which are set as 10 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively, are entered in the GUI.
The processing of the MS ﬁles is displayed in Figure 1, which is done by pressing the button once without any further user interaction.
Peptrix uses the following applications and ﬁles invisibly: (1) R.exe (http://www.r-project.org/) to trace differentially expressed peptides in the groups with the Wilco- xon Mann Whitney module  (2) Readw.exe (version 4.3.1, http://sourceforge.net/projects/sashimi/ﬁles/) converting the *.RAW ﬁles into *.mzXML ﬁles  (3) the *.fasta ﬁle and HUMAN.fasta in this study, which is the text database to cor- relate MS2 fragmentation masses to a protein and (4) tan- dem.exe to search for the most likely protein.
Tandem.exe reads both Mascot generic ﬁles, *.MGF, with the peptide par- ent mass and the MS2 fragmentation masses, and the 38.1 MB HUMAN.fasta ﬁle.
The HUMAN.fasta ﬁle can be downloaded as HUMAN.fasta.gz archive (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/dat- abases/uniprot/) in the directory current_release/knowledge- base/proteomes/.
Peptrix generates a MGF ﬁle for each Orbitrapä ﬁle.
for  At ﬁrst, a pop-up window is displayed by Peptrix to search for the ﬁles and programs in the computer ﬁle sys- tem: (1) R.exe  (2) Readw.exe (version 4.3.1)  (3) *.fasta ﬁle and (4) tandem.exe.
The paths to the ﬁles in the ﬁle system and ﬁle names are saved as records in the Table Itemvalue of the MySQL database (Supplementary File 1).
Peptrix once again prompts for the ﬁle or the program when the ﬁles or programs are not found in a subsequent analysis, for example, because they have been deleted from the computer ﬁle system.
Availability and requirements  Peptrix is freely available.
It requires Microsoft Windows 2000 OS or higher, R (R-2.15.1-win.exe or higher), Quick  n Easy FTP Server Lite version 3.2 or higher, MySQL 5.5.27 (mys- ql-5.5.27-win32.msi) or higher database, Java Runtime Envi- ronment (JRE) 7 Update 7 or higher (jre-7u7-windows- i586.exe), Eclipse Classic (Eclipse Juno 4.2.0)   Windows, edtftpj-2.3.0 or higher (edtftpj.jar), Connector/J (mysql-con- nector-java-5.1.22-bin.jar or higher), X!Tandem (tandem- win-11-12-01-1.zip) (tandem.exe), HUMAN.fasta (HUMAN.
fasta.gz) and Readw.exe (version 4.3.1) (ReAdW-4.3.1.zip) for running.
The source code of Peptrix is available as a zip ﬁle (http://sourceforge.net/projects/peptrix/ﬁles/), as well as the database script (Supplementary File 1), with detailed installa- tion and running instructions and URLs of the software pro- viders.
The raw Orbitrapä ﬁles conversion to mzXML formatted ﬁles was tested with Readw.exe version 4.3.1.
Be- cause the Readw.exe program depends on Windows-only ven- dor libraries from Thermo, the code for Orbitrapä data handling will only work under Windows with Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁcs  Xcalibur software installed.
If the Readw.exe pro- gram does not work properly, zlib1.dll should be downloaded (http://sourceforge.net/projects/peptrix/ﬁles/).
The library zlib1.dll can be placed in the c:/windows/system32/directory and   regsvr32 c:/windows/system32/zlib1.dll   or   regsvr32 zlib1.dll   can be executed in the Windows command prompt (MSDOS box).
If a 64-bit version of Windows is used, zlib1.dll should be copied in C:/Windows/SysWOW64/.
