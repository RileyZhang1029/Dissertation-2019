The single-cell growth probability of Listeria monocytogenes was characterized in tryptone
soy broth supplemented with 0.6% yeast extract at temperature ranging from 5 to 25˚C,
pH ranging from 4.4 to 6.5, and water activity ranging from 0.919 to 0.989. Growth was
monitored visually in 96-microwell plates and the growth probability was deduced from
concentrations estimated with the MPN calculation. Models were proposed to describe
the increase of the probability from 0 to 1 with increasing values of environmental factors.
An exponential model was used for the temperature and the individual minimal tempera-
ture for growth ranged from −3.6˚C [−4.5˚C, −2.7˚C] to 17.3˚C [16.0˚C, 18.6˚C]. An inverse
exponential model was convenient for the pH and the minimal pH for growth of individ-
ual cells ranged from 4.34 [3.93, 4.75] to 5.93 [4.85, 7.01]. A linear model was used for
the water activity and the minimal value for growth of individual cells ranged from 0.917
[0.909, 0.925] to 0.988 [0.966, 1]. In spite of the great between-experiment variability, the
minimal values estimated for the growth limits of individual cells were in accordance with
values usually proposed for L. monocytogenes populations. This study provides models
allowing the prediction of the growth probability of a few cells contaminating chilled foods
with suboptimal pH and water activity improving thus the assessment of the behavior of
L. monocytogenes cells naturally contaminating foods.

INTRODUCTION
Listeria monocytogenes is a well-known foodborne pathogen and
constitutes a kind of paragon for quantitative microbiology since
its ubiquitous nature leading to a frequent contamination of food
and its ability to multiply in many foods during chilled storage
encouraged the development of predictive modeling and quanti-
tative microbial risk assessment. Many risk assessments were thus
published aiming at assessing the probability of severe listeriosis
when eating ready-to-eat foods (Anonymous, 2003, 2004; Pouil-
lot et al., 2009; Ross et al., 2009a; Mataragas et al., 2010), ranking
the most risky foods (Anonymous, 2003; Ross et al., 2009a), or
assessing the impact of management options on the listeriosis
probability (Anonymous, 2003, 2004; Pouillot et al., 2009; Ross
et al., 2009b; Mataragas et al., 2010). The assessment of the micro-
bial behavior of the pathogen is of the highest importance when
performing these assessments since the listeriosis cases are pre-
dominantly linked to the consumption of highly contaminated
foods (Anonymous, 2004) and considering the variability of this
behavior is of paramount in the context of risk analysis framework
(Anonymous, 2008). The major sources of variability affecting
microbial responses in foods are the initial contamination level,
the variability in processing factors, the variability in the food
characteristics, in the storage conditions, and the biological vari-
ability, i.e., the variability of microbial behavior. For several years,
it is accepted that the accurate behavior prediction of L. monocy-
togenes in food requires a single-cell approach taking into account
the physiological state of cells initially contaminating foods since

this will strongly inﬂuence the lag phase duration of the bacte-
rial population. Theoretical developments (Baranyi, 1998) and
experimental results (Elfwing et al., 2004; Guillier et al., 2005;
Pin and Baranyi, 2006; Métris et al., 2008) describing the vari-
ability of single-cell lag times among clonal bacterial populations
and showing the increase of this variability when inimical treat-
ments are applied to bacterial cells were published. It is also
known for decades that bacterial injury can inhibit the growth
initiation of some cells in a population and this is of ﬁrst impor-
tance when studying the resuscitation of stressed cells in selective
culture media (Wu, 2008). It was shown that it is possible to char-
acterize the single-cell growth probability corresponding to the
probability for an individual cell to initiate growth in a given cul-
ture medium (Dupont and Augustin, 2009). Some experiments
have also suggested the possibility that minimal values of envi-
ronmental factors allowing the multiplication of individual cells
can vary from one cell to another. Pascual et al. (2001) observed
an increase of the inoculum size needed to initiate growth of L.
monocytogenes when increasing the NaCl concentration in the
growth medium or when decreasing its pH. Koutsoumanis and
Sofos (2005) observed that the growth boundaries of L. monocyto-
genes according to the temperature, the pH, and the water activity
were affected by the inoculum size and that higher numbers of cells
increased the growth probability. Koutsoumanis (2008) reported
similar observations with Salmonella.

The aim of this study was to characterize the single-cell growth
probability of L. monocytogenes according to the three major

environmental factors, i.e., the temperature, the pH, and the water
activity, and then to characterize the variability of the individual
minimal temperature, pH, and water activity for growth of a strain
of this pathogen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STRAIN AND INOCULUM PREPARATION
Listeria monocytogenes LM14 (serotype 4b, environment of meat
industry isolate) was maintained at −20˚C on cryobeads (AES
Laboratoire, Combourg, France). The strain LM14 is the refer-
ence strain of the French program in predictive microbiology
Sym’Previus1.

Cryobeads were incubated at 30˚C for 24 h in tryptone soy broth
supplemented with 0.6% yeast extract (TSBye, LEB Oxoid, Uni-
path Ltd., Basingstoke, UK). The ﬁrst bacterial culture was diluted
to obtain an initial bacterial concentration of approximately 103
−1 in TSBye. This bacterial suspension was then incubated
cells ml
−1 in the exponential
in TSBye for 18 h at 25˚C to obtain 108 cells ml
growth phase. TSBye was eliminated by centrifugation (3,000× g,
10 min, 4˚C), cells were washed in 0.85% NaCl (AES Laboratoire),
and centrifuged again. The supernatant was discarded and the
cells were recovered in tryptone salt broth (TS, AES Laboratoire).
Aliquots of 1 ml of TS containing 108 cells were stored at −20˚C
for 48 h to 6 months.

IMPACT OF TEMPERATURE, pH, AND WATER ACTIVITY ON THE
SINGLE-CELL GROWTH PROBABILITY
The probability for individual cells of L. monocytogenes to initiate
growth was studied in TSBye adjusted to different suboptimal tem-
peratures, pH, or water activities. TSBye incubated at 37˚C was the
reference condition assumed to be the most favorable condition
for growth allowing the growth of all the viable cells. The tested
conditions for temperature were 5, 7.5, 10.5, 13, 15, and 20.5˚C,
pH of TSBye was adjusted to 7 and no salt was added (i.e., water
activity equal to 0.997). The tested conditions for pH were 4.4, 4.5,
4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5 by adding HCl
(Prolabo, Paris, France) to TSBye and incubation was performed
at 15 and 37˚C. The tested conditions for water activity were 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, and 12% (wt/vol) of added NaCl
to pH 7 TSBye incubated at 15 and 37˚C. The corresponding water
activities, aw, were calculated according the relationship published
by Chirife and Resnik (1984):

aw = 1 − 0.0052471 · WPS − 0.00012206 · WPS2

(1)

where WPS is the percentage of water phase salt.

The deduced aw were 0.989, 0.983, 0.977, 0.971, 0.964, 0.957,
0.950, 0.947, 0.943, 0.939, 0.935, 0.931, 0.928, and 0.919, respec-
tively. Each tested condition was replicated between 3 and 18 times
(10 times on average).

ESTIMATION OF SINGLE-CELL GROWTH PROBABILITY
Aliquots of cells stored at −20˚C were thawed at room tempera-
ture and diluted in TSBye. Two 96-microwell plates were ﬁlled with

dilutions adjusted to obtain between 10 and 90% of wells showing
growth in reference and tested conditions or 24 wells were each
ﬁlled with three successive 10-fold dilutions of cell suspensions.
The microplates were covered with paraﬁlm to avoid dehydration
and then incubated at 37˚C for 48 h for reference condition and
for up to 3 months for tested conditions. Wells exhibiting turbidity
in TSBye were considered as positive for growth.

Assuming a Poisson distribution of cells in the wells, the cell
concentrations in reference and tested conditions were calculated
with the BAM-MPN Excel spreadsheet developed by Garthright
and Blodgett (2003) from the observed proportion of positive
wells obtained for each inoculated dilutions. The Excel spread-
sheet is freely available on the US Food and Drug Administration
website2.

The probability for a single-cell to initiate growth, p, is equal to

(Dupont and Augustin, 2009):

(cid:2)

p = ci

cref

(2)

where c i is the cell concentration in tested conditions i and c ref
is the concentration in reference conditions. Strictly speaking, the
single-cell growth probability, p, is effectively related to the ability
for an individual cell to multiply but also to the multiplication
ability of its daughter cells.

DEVELOPMENT OF MODELS DESCRIBING THE EVOLUTION OF THE
SINGLE-CELL GROWTH PROBABILITY WITH TEMPERATURE, pH, AND
WATER ACTIVITY
The single-cell growth probability, p, increase from 0 to 1 when
environmental factors values increases to more favorable condi-
tions. We thus deﬁne two theoretical parameters X inf and X sup
where X represents the temperature, T, the pH, or aw. When X is
smaller than X inf, p is equal to 0 and when X is greater than X sup,
p is equal to 1. The increase of p when X increased from X inf to
X sup was exponential for T, inverse exponential for pH, and linear
for aw.

The following models were used to describe these trends:

This equation was used to correct single-cell growth probabili-

MODEL FITTING AND SINGLE-CELL GROWTH PROBABILITY
PREDICTION
Since great between-experiments variability was observed, we used
a non-linear mixed effects model to model the random effects cor-
responding to the between-experiments variability. The normal
distributions describing the parameter variability were estimated
using the Monolix software3.

Monte Carlo simulations were performed to predict the single-
cell growth probability distribution according to the environmen-
tal factors. Parameters values were independently and randomly
selected from their respective normal distributions and 104 itera-
tions were performed with the Matlab software R2010 (The Math-
Works Inc., Natick, MA, USA). These simulations allowed deﬁning
variation or credibility intervals for estimated probabilities.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Evolutions of the single-cell growth probability, p, according to
T, pH, and aw are presented in Figure 1. The observed between-
experiment variability was large and, for instance, p-values ranged
from 0.52 to 0.94 at 15˚C, from 0.27 to 0.97 at pH 5, and from
0.19 to 0.79 at aw 0.95. This variation is unexplained. It is partly
due to the great uncertainty of concentrations estimated with the
MPN method and also perhaps to the variability in physiologi-
cal state of microbial populations used in experiments. This great
between-experiment variability in single cell growth probability
was already observed by Dupont and Augustin (2009) and can be
partly explained by the difﬁculty to experimentally reproduce spe-
ciﬁc microbial physiological states. In this study, we chose 48 h to
six months frozen storage to standardize the microbial population,
but despite an approximately stable cell viability observed on non-
selective culture media during the storage length, no trend in the
single cell growth probability with the storage duration, and the
great variability observed for same aged aliquots experimentally
used the same day, we can imagine that the observed variabil-
ity is essentially linked to physiological heterogeneity of bacterial
aliquots.

The estimated model parameters are presented in Table 1. The
proposed models described satisfactorily the observed increases in
probability with environmental factors and the random effects
quantiﬁed by σexperiment allowed the prediction of a variation
region in accordance with observed probabilities (Figure 1).

Single-cell growth probability of Listeria monocytogenes

The theoretical cellular minimal temperature for growth var-
ied from −3.6 to 17.3˚C with a 95% variation interval for −3.6˚C
ranging from −4.5 to −2.7˚C. The interval for the upper value is
[16.0˚C, 18.6˚C]. These values match the usual minimal tempera-
tures estimated for L. monocytogenes populations which classically
vary between−4 and 2˚C (Anonymous, 2004; Augustin et al., 2005;
Couvert et al., 2010; Mejlholm et al., 2010). For the pH, the cellular
minimal value for growth varied from 4.34 to 5.93 and the 95%
variation interval for 4.34 ranged from 3.93 to 4.75. The interval
for the upper value is [4.85, 7.01]. These values also match the usual
population estimations for minimal pH adjusted with HCl allow-
ing the growth of L. monocytogenes which are located between 4.2
and 4.3 (Anonymous, 2004; Augustin et al., 2005; Couvert et al.,
2010; Mejlholm et al., 2010). For the water activity, the cellular
minimal value for growth ranged from 0.917 to 0.988 with a 95%
variation interval ranging from 0.909 to 0.925 for the lower value.
The interval for the upper value is [0.966, 1]. The classical estima-
tions for the minimal population water activity ranged from 0.91
to 0.93 (Anonymous, 2004; Augustin et al., 2005; Couvert et al.,
2010; Mejlholm et al., 2010). Aguirre and Koutsoumanis (2011)
studied the aw growth limits of individual cells of another strain
of L. monocytogenes on tryptone soy agar (TSA). They observed
a distribution of individual limits varying from 0.937 to 0.997.
These higher values obtained on TSA in comparison with those
observed in our study in TSBye are not surprising since Kout-
soumanis et al. (2004) already observed a signiﬁcant difference
between the growth limits in broth and agar with a substantial
increase in growth limits on agar.

The model proposed in Eq. 6 can then be used to estimate
the growth probability of a L. monocytogenes population in sub-
optimal conditions for the environmental factors, temperature,
pH, and water activity according to the number of cells present

in the population. In this case the growth probability is equal to
1− (1− p)n with n the number of cells. The model was applied
to predict the evolution of the growth probability of L. mono-
cytogenes with the inoculum size. Figure 2 shows examples of
predicted growth/no growth interfaces in the same conditions as
Koutsoumanis and Sofos (2005) used for L. monocytogenes in tryp-
tic soy broth at 15˚C. The growth/no growth interface logically
moved with the inoculum size and, for instance, the water activity
corresponding to a growth probability of 0.5 for pH 5 was 0.93
with a 95% credibility interval between 0.92 and 0.945 for an ini-
tial population of 0.9 log cells (Figure 2A), this minimal water
activity decreased to 0.92 (with a 95% credibility interval between
0.91 and 0.925) when the initial population increased to 4.2 log
cells (Figure 2B). Although the minimal values for growth seemed
different (mainly the minimal water activity), the growth/no inter-
faces were close for a small initial population (Figure 2A). On the
other hand, a signiﬁcant gap was observed between the interfaces
describing the limits of a large population (Figure 2B). This gap
was partly linked to the very low water activity allowing growth
of high inoculum obtained by Koutsoumanis and Sofos (2005).
They observed a value of approximately 0.89 (Figure 2B) signiﬁ-
cantly lower than our mean estimation for minimal water activity
of 0.917. Moreover, the shape of the growth/no growth interface
observed by Koutsoumanis and Sofos (2005) for low pH poten-
tially indicated synergistic effects of environmental factors that are
not taken into account in the model Eq. 6.

Although supplementary experiments are necessary to investi-
gate the potential effect of interactions between the environmental
factors on the single-cell growth probability, the results presented
in this paper, and the provided models are useful to assess the
behavior of a few L. monocytogenes cells contaminating a food.
The complementary use of this model with models describing the
