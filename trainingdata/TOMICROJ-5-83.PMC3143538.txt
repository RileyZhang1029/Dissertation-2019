Abstract:  This  study  compared  the  proteomic  profile  of  outer  membrane  proteins  (OMPs)  from  one  strain  of  atypical  
enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (aEPEC) and one of typical EPEC (tEPEC). The OMPs fractions were obtained using 
sarcosine  extraction,  and  analyzed  by  one-  and  two-dimensional  gel  electrophoresis  (1DE  and  2DE,  respectively).  The 
1DE  OMPs  analysis  of  typical  and  atypical  EPEC  evidenced  similar  patterns;  however,  the  2DE  OMP  profile  from  the 
aEPEC revealed more protein spots in the 40- to 70-kDa region. 2DE image analysis identified 159 protein spots in both 
strains whereas 53 protein spots were observed only in tEPEC and 128 were observed only in aEPEC. Remarkably, 41.5% 
of aEPEC spots showed higher levels of expression compared to tEPEC, some of which with two, others four or even five 
times more. Twenty-four selected spots were identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and they corresponded to 
proteins involved in cell structure and metabolism, as well as in gene regulation. Some of these proteins showed similarity 
with proteins  identified  in other E.  coli pathotypes. Besides,  the differential expression of  some proteins in aEPEC  may 
suggest that it  could be related  to their  features that  ascertain the  adaptation to distinct  environments  and the worldwide 
spread distribution of these pathogens. 

Keywords: Atypical and typical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, proteome, OMP profiles.  

INTRODUCTION 

  Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC)  infections  are one 
of  the  major  causes  of  morbi-mortality  in  developing  and 
even  in  industrialized  countries.  Among  the  DEC  patho-
types,  the  enteropathogenic  E.  coli  (EPEC)  is  still  a  signifi-
cant  pathogen  involved  in  infantile  diarrhea  [1].  The  patho-
genesis  of  EPEC  infection  is  the  consequence  of  the  attach-
ing and effacing (A/E) lesion on the intestinal mucosa, which 
is characterized by microvilli destruction, intimate adherence 
of  bacteria  to  the  epithelium,  aggregation  of  polarized  actin 
and  other  elements  of  the  cytoskeleton  at  site  of  bacterial 
attachment leading to pedestal-like structures [2]. The ability 
to  induce  the  A/E  histopathology  is  encoded  by  genes  pre-
sent on a 35-kb pathogenicity island named  locus of entero-
cyte  effacement  (LEE)  [3].  LEE  encodes  a  94-kDa  outer 
membrane  protein  (intimin)  responsible  for  the  intimate  ad-
herence of the bacteria to the enterocyte membrane; its trans-
located  receptor  (Tir);  components  of  a  type  III  secretion 
system;  and  effector  molecules  that  interfere  with  the  
eukaryotic cell processes [4].

Some EPEC strains  carry  a plasmid named EPEC  adher-
ence  factor  (EAF),  which  encodes  a  type  IV  pilus  called 
bundle-forming  pilus  (BFP),  which  interconnect  bacteria 
within  three-dimensional  microcolonies  [5].  EPEC  was  
subgrouped  in  typical  and  atypical,  based  on  the  presence 
and  absence  of  EAF,  respectively  [6].  Currently,  aEPEC  is 
defined as E. coli strains which may or not fit in the classical 
EPEC  serogroups,  induce  the  characteristic  A/E  lesion,  do 
not express BFP and lack Shiga-toxin genes [7-10]. 

  The  outer  membrane  (OM)  constitutes 
the  border  
between  the  bacteria  and  the  environment,  and  as  one  of  its 
major  functions,  protects  Gram-negative  bacteria  against 
adversities. This concentric lipid bilayer covering the cell has 
50% of its mass  composed by proteins, either integral mem-
brane  proteins  or  anchored  lipoproteins  [11].  More  than 
twenty  diverse  outer  membrane  proteins  (OMPs)  have  been 
identified in E. coli, and several different characteristics have 
been  already  described,  including  adhesion,  invasion,  bacte-
riophage receptors, resistance to antibiotics and permeability 
controls,  as  well  as  structural  functions  [11,  12].  OMPs  so 
far  described  in  EPEC  as  virulence  factors  include  intimin 
[13] and Efa1/LifA [14] acting as adhesins. 

 
Proteomic  approaches  have  been  described  as  powerful 
platform  technology  for  the  study  of  protein  expression  and 
identification (reviewed in reference [15]).

  Li et al. [16] compared the proteomic profile of extracel-
lular proteins of tEPEC E2348/69 and  enterohemorrhagic E. 
coli  (EHEC)  EDL933,  demonstrating  that  besides  the  four 
common  extracellular  proteins  EspA,  EspB,  EspD  and  Tir, 
26  other  proteins  were  conserved  in  both  strains.  Here  it 
must  be  emphasized  that  the  most  recent  proteomic  data  for 
EPEC  is  related  to  the  prototype  strain  E2348/69  (serotype 
O127:H6). 

 
Since  the  recognition  of  aEPEC  as  enteropathogens,  
several  geographic  epidemiological  reports  evidenced  its 
clear  predominance  as  agent  of  diarrhea  syndromes  [17-22]. 
The  latest  studies  have  been  demonstrated  the  replacement  
of  tEPEC  by  aEPEC  in  developed  countries  and  the  high 
prevalence of the latter in developing countries [8, 21, 23]. 

  Thus  in  this  original  study  we  analyzed  by  two-
dimensional  gel  electrophoresis  (2DE)  and  MALDI-TOF 
mass  spectrometry  the  OMP  extracts  of  both  tEPEC  and 
aEPEC  belonging  to  the  O55  serogroup  showing  that  some 
of  the  identified  proteins  have  some  similarity  with  proteins 
identified  in  other  E.  coli  pathotypes.  Besides,  the  higher 
expression  of  some  aEPEC  proteins  may  be  related  to  their 
features that ascertain the adaptation to distinct environments 
and the worldwide spread distribution of these pathogens.  

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions 

  Two  EPEC  strains  belonging  to  the  same  serogroup:  tE-
PEC  O55:H6  (strain  23)  and  aEPEC  O55:H7  (strain  07), 
were selected for this study. These strains belong to the bac-
terial  collection  Laboratory  of  Bacteriology  (Butantan  Insti-
tute,  São  Paulo,  Brazil)  and  were  previously  characterized 
[24]. Cultures  were grown during 18 h at 37°C, under shak-
ing  (250  rpm),  in  100  ml  of  Luria-Bertani  broth  (LB)  or  in 
Dulbecco’s  modified  Eagle  medium  (DMEM)  for  the  outer 
membrane proteins extraction.  

Isolation of Outer Membrane Proteins (OMPs) 

  OMPs  were  isolated  by  the  method  described  by  Acht-
man  et  al. [25]  with  minor  modifications.  After  growth,  the 
bacterial cells were recovered by  centrifugation at 4,300 x g 
for  15  min  at  4°C,  and  suspended  in  5  ml  of  10  mM  Tris 
buffer  pH  8.0  supplemented  with  1  mM  phenylmethyl-
sulfenylfluoride  (PMSF)  (Sigma-Aldrich  Co.,  St.  Louis, 
MO). Cells were disrupted by sonication at 50 % output, 2 x 
80  sec,  and  the  cell  debris  were  removed  by  centrifugation. 
The  supernatant  was  centrifuged  at  49,500  x  g  for  60  
min  at  4°C  and  the  pellet  was  treated  with  1.67%  N-
lauroylsarcosine  (Sigma-Aldrich  Co  St.  Louis,  MO)  for  20 
min at room temperature. The OMPs were recovered by cen-
trifugation  at  23,000  x  g  for  90  min  at  4°C.  The  pellet  was 
resuspended  in  50  ml  of  10  mM  Tris  buffer  pH  8.0  with  1 
mM  PMSF  and  the  protein  concentration  was  quantified  by 
the  Bradford  method  [26]  and  stored  at  -20°C.  The  OMP 
fractions of both bacterial strains were extracted  at  the same 
time and under the same conditions.  

One-Dimensional Electrophoresis (1DE) 

  OMPs  extracts  were  separated  by  12.5%  polyacrylamide 
gel  electrophoresis  containing  dodecyl  sodium  sulphate 

Taddei et al. 

(SDS/PAGE)  according  to  Laemmli  [27]  on  a  Bio-Rad  Pro-
tean  3  mini-system,  and  visualized  by  silver  staining  [28]. 
For  immunoblotting  analysis,  OMPs  extracts  resolved  by 
1DE were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and treated 
as  described  by  Towbin  et  al.  [29],  using  mouse  polyclonal 
anti-OMP  sera,  and  anti-mouse  IgG  conjugated  to  horserad-
ish peroxidase, were used as secondary antibodies. The reac-
tion was developed with a mixture of diaminobenzidine and 
3% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma).  

2-Dimensional Electrophoresis (2DE) and Image Analysis 

IPGphor 

Isoeletric  Focusing  System 

 
Prior  to  the  first  dimension,  precast  IPG  strips  (24  cm, 
pH 4-7, linear, GE Healthcare) were rehydrated with 450 (cid:1)L 
of DeStreak rehydration solution (GE Healthcare) containing 
0.8% IPG buffer (GE Healthcare) and 170 (cid:1)g of proteins, for 
16 h at room temperature. First dimension was carried out in 
an  Ettan 
(GE 
Healthcare)  at  20°C  with  current  limit  50  (cid:1)A/strip  until  fo-
cusing  reached  70  kVh.  After  focusing,  the  proteins  were 
reduced and alkylated by sequential incubation in the follow-
ing solutions: 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 2% SDS; 30% glyc-
erol,  6  M  urea,  0.006%  bromophenol  blue  (equilibration 
buffer-EB), 20 mg/mL DTT in EB; and then a solution of 30 
mg/mL  iodoacetamide  in  EB.  Then,  the  strips  were  directly 
applied  to  12%  polyacrylamide  gels.  Molecular-weight 
markers  (were  applied  at  the  basic  end  of  the  IPG  strips. 
Electrophoresis  was  carried  out  for  12  h  at  10°C.  Following 
separation  in  the  second  dimension,  the  gels  were  fixed  and 
then stained with silver. Images were analyzed (ImageMaster 
2D Platinum software, version 5.0; GE Healthcare, Uppsala, 
Sweden) as follows. Observed molecular masses for resolved 
proteins  were  calculated  by  comparing  their  mobility  to 
those  of  molecular  weight  markers,  and  the  pI  values  were 
calculated  according  to  linearity  of  the  IPG  strips  using  the 
software.  ImageMaster  2D  Platinum  detection  parameters, 
such  as  number  of  smooth,  saliency,  and  minimum  area, 
were adjusted for every selected region of each gel  to detect 
protein  spots  automatically.  Subsequently,  each  protein  spot 
received  an  identification  number,  which  was  confirmed 
visually.  Spots  found  along  the  edges  of  the  gels  and 
streaked  spots  were  not  considered  for  further  analysis.  For 
each  protein,  the  spot  volume  was  calculated,  according  to 
the software manual, as above of the mark border situated at 
75% of the spot height (measured from the peak of the spot), 
which permitted the automatic subtraction of the background 
values. The volume percentage of each spot was determined 
in relation to the total amount of all marks in the gel. In order 
to  evaluate  the  reproducibility  between  the  duplicates  and 
independent  experiments,  the  correlation  coefficient  was 
calculated  according  to  the  volume  percent  of  paired  spots 
[30].  Spots  of  each  gel  of  aEPEC  and  tEPEC  were  matched 
and  the  percent  volume  of  spots  was  compared.  The  protein 
spot  levels  were  considered  to  have  higher  or  lower  volume 
when there was at least a 1.5-fold difference [31-33]. 

Protein Digestion and Mass Spectrometry Identification 

 
For  protein  identification,  protein  bands  were  excised 
from  the  2DE  gels,  destained,  and  in-gel  trypsin  digested 
[34].  The  tryptic  peptide  mixture  was  lyophilized,  dissolved 
in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, subjected to ZipTip C18 (Milli-
pore  Co.,  Bedford,  MA),  and  spotted  onto  the  sample  plate

Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) mixed to the same volume of 
a  saturated  solution  of  (cid:1)-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic  acid 
(Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) in 50% acetonitrile / 0.1% 
trifluoroacetic  acid,  and  analyzed  using  P14R  [(M+H)+ 
1533.8582]  and  angiotensin  II  [(M  +  H)+  1046.5423] 
(Sigma-Aldhrich,  Saint  Louis,  MO)  as  external  calibrants. 
Mass  lists  were  used  to  screen  against  database  including 
Mascot  (www.matrixscience.com)  programs  using  the  Na-
tional  Center  for  Biotechnology  Information  nonredundant 
database  (NCBI  nr  2005.01.06).  The  resulting  spectra  were 
searched  against  non-redundant  protein  database  (NCBI) 
using  Mascot  with carbamidomethylation as fixed modifica-
tion,  oxidation  of  methionine  as  variable  modifications,  one 
trypsin missed cleavage and a mass tolerance of 0.5 Da.  

RESULTS 

Comparison of OMPs Profiles by 1DE and 2DE 

  The 1DE OMP analysis was carried out in order to estab-
lish  the  possible  differences  between  tEPEC  and  aEPEC  af-
ter  being  cultivated  in  LB  or  DMEM.  The  expression  of 
OMPs was more prominent for both strains when they were 
cultivated  in  LB  (Fig.  1).  However,  no  significant  differ-
ences were observed between the two strains. These findings 
were  confirmed  by  immunoblotting  using  mouse  polyclonal 
anti-OMP serum, suggesting that, under these conditions, the 
qualitative 1DE is not appropriated to compare OMP expres-
sion in EPEC (Fig. 2).

  High-resolution  2DE  to  separate  OMPs  was  conducted 
with extracts from aEPEC and tEPEC cultivated in LB, since 
the  expression  of  OMPs  was  higher  in  this  medium  as  indi-
cated by 1DE analysis.  

 
Initially,  a  broad-range  immobilized  pH  gradient  (IPG) 
strips (pH 3-10) and narrow-range IPG strips (pH 4-7) were 
tested.  Better  separation  was  achieved  when  pH  4-7  IPG 

strips  were  employed  (data  no  shown).  Therefore,  pH  4-7 
IPG  strips  were  chosen  for  isoelectric  focusing  in  the  2DE 
experiments.  To  compare  silver-stained  protein  spots  of 
aEPEC and tEPEC gels, these were concomitantly stained in 
the  same  tray,  and  digitalized  as  tagged  image  files  (TIF) 
immediately  after  staining.  2DE  OMP  profiles  from  four 
pairs of silver-stained analytical gels from four different ex-
periments  were  compared.  Fig.  3  (A  and B)  shows  the  elec-
trophoretical  profiles  of  aEPEC  (07)  and  tEPEC  (23)  OMP 
extracts, respectively.

OMP extract reacted with a pool of negative control sera. 
 
  The gels were submitted to image analysis using the Im-
age  Master  Computer  program,  which  detected  159  protein 
spots  in  aEPEC  and  tEPEC  gels.  Using  as  analysis  parame-
ters the pI value and the molecular mass of each spot present 
in  both  gels,  the  ratios  of  spot  volume  between  them  were 
estimated. As shown in Table 1, 53 spots of aEPEC showed 
similar or lower intensity than the correspondent spot of tE-
PEC,  while  40  spots  showed  a  somewhat  higher  intensity. 
Interestingly,  the  remaining  66  spots  of  the  aEPEC  strain 
showed  two  times  and  in  some  cases  four  or  five  times 
higher abundance than the corresponding spots in the tEPEC 
strain (Fig. 3).  

  Moreover, 53 protein spots were observed only in tEPEC 
(Fig. 3B) and 128 spots only in aEPEC (Fig. 3A). The 2De gels 
of  OMPs  from  aEPEC  showed  more  protein  spots  ranging 
from  40  kDa  to  70  kDa,  which  were  not  present  in  tEPEC 
(Fig. 3B) or expressed in a lower level, suggesting that tEPEC 
and aEPEC OMP proteomes are significantly different. 

Protein Identification 

 
For  protein  identification,  24  spots  were  chosen  and  ex-
cised from the gels and submitted to in-gel trypsin digestion 
for  mass  spectrometric  identification.  The  chosen  spots  in-
cluded  some  observed  only  on  the  aEPEC  gel,  and  some 
observed  in  both  gels,  however  with  a  greater  expression 
level in aEPEC extract (Tables 2 and 3). 

  Among the identified spots, sixteen were present in both 
OMP  extracts,  but  the  majority  showed  higher  expression

1.86 fold changes (Table 2). The other two spots (07-117 and 
07-282) were four and three times over expressed in aEPEC, 
respectively, in comparison to tEPEC (Table 2).

algorithm  [35]  and  the  results  are  shown  in  Table  3.  The  
predicted  cellular  location  of  five  out  of  eight  proteins  

was  determined  as  unknown,  and  the  other  three  were

DISCUSSION 

 
In this study we analyzed the OMP profile of aEPEC and 
tEPEC  strains  belonging  to  the  O55  serogroup  using  1DE 
and  2DE  methodologies.  No  differences  were  observed 
comparing  the  OMP  profiles  from  both  strains  by  1DE 
analysis,  neither  regarding  protein  band  presence  nor  inten-
sity. This finding indicates that the comparison of OMP pro-
files  between  different  strains  using  only  1DE  analysis 
should be considered with precaution. 

  The choice of O55 serogroup was based on the fact that it 
is  one  of  the  few  serogroups  shared  by  aEPEC  and  tEPEC 
[1].  Besides,  EPEC  O55:H6  (tEPEC)  used  to  be  the  third-
most-frequent  serogroup  implicated  in  infantile  diarrhea 
[24],  while  EPEC  O55:H7  (aEPEC)  is  a  distinct  clone,  ge-
netic  related  to  O157:H7  since  these  two  clones  seems  to 
have the same most recent ancestor [36], making this aEPEC 
serogroup a specialized enteric pathogen with a propensity to 
acquire new virulence genes [24].

  Rosensheine et al. [37] reported  that some virulence fac-
tors  related  to  the  LEE  region  were  better  expressed  when 
the bacteria were  cultivated in DMEM. In our study, the ex-
pression of OMPs of EPEC strains was not significant when 
they were cultivated in DMEM, either in the presence of CO2 
or  when  the  bacterial  was  cultivated  in  pre-conditioned 
DMEM (data not shown). This finding must be better eluci-
dated,  but  it  seems  s  that  these  proteins  present  in  outer 
membrane  of  EPEC  strains  do  not  have  their  expression 
regulated by the LEE region. 

  Although  the  aim  of  this  study  was  the  characterization 
of OMP profiles, the methodology employed for their extrac-
tion [25] resulted in the identification of some cytoplasmatic, 
periplasmatic  and  inner  membrane  proteins  involved  in  bio-
chemical  and  genomic  regulation.  It  has  been  well  estab-
lished  that  some  cellular  proteins  other  than  OMPs  may  be 
present  in  outer  membrane  extracts  [38].  In  order  to  assure 
that these results were reproducible, the same amount of pro-
tein  was  loaded  on  each  gel,  and  the  same  profile  was  ob-
served  in  the  different  assays.  Lai  et  al.  [39]  reported  the 
OMPs  profile  of  E.  coli  minicell,  and  the  more  prominent 
protein  spots  were  identified  as  OmpA,  OmpT  and  OmpX, 
ranging  from  14  kDa  to  40  kDa.  The  same  profile  was  ob-
served  in  aEPEC  and  tEPEC  OMPs  in  our  study.  OmpA  
resolved in multiple spots of different masses and isoelectric 
points,  suggesting  protein  degradation  and/or  modifications. 
Similar  migration  profile  of  these  proteins  was  previously 
reported [39, 40].  

of them were three, four or even five times over expressed in 
aEPEC; however the same volume ratio was observed for the 
proteins  appointed.  This  higher  expression  of  some  aEPEC 
proteins may suggest that it could be related to their features 
that ascertain the adaptation to distinct environments and the 
worldwide spread distribution of these pathogens. 

  We  have  validated  the  expression  of  9  proteins  assigned 
as  hypothetical  proteins  of  unknown  function  by  genome 
annotation.  The  proteome  expression  of  these  proteins  in 
EPEC O55 strains validates their  existence within the bacte-
ria.  These  proteins  were  not  related  to  OMPs  by  the  pre-
dicted  cellular  location  analysis,  although  they  may  be  in-
volved  in  EPEC  pathogenesis  or  be  related  to  phenotypic 
features  in  aEPEC,  since  they  are  located  in  bacterial  mem-
brane,  and  may  be  the  first  step  in  host  interaction.  These 
findings are under investigation in our laboratory.

  Also noteworthy is the fact that the most of these proteins 
showed  similarity  with  those  identified  in  other  E.  coli 
pathotypes,  showing 
the  genetic 
backbone  of  the  E.  coli  ancester  strains.  Spots  07-162  and 
07-179  correspond  to  proteins  involved  in  transcriptional 
regulation.  The  first  one  was  reported  in  EHEC  strains,  and 
the  second  was  reported  in  enteroinvasive  E.  coli  strain 
53638  (accession  number:  NZ_AAKB02000001).  The  07-
192  spot  corresponds  to  a  protein  involved  in  conjugation 
mobilization,  and  spot  number  07-293  corresponds  to  an 
isomerase, reported in an avian pathogenic E. coli [41].  

  The  analysis  of  expression  ratios  between  the  EPEC 
strains  revealed  interesting  results.  Forty  one  percent  of  the 
spots  observed  in  both  OMP  extracts  showed  a  higher  
volume in aEPEC, and the ratio analysis indicated that some 

  We  could  not  demonstrate  the  presence  and  differences 
in expression rates of intimin of two EPEC strains. This may 
be explained by the fact that the pI of intimin is 8, i.e., higher 
than  the  pI  range  used  in  this  study.  In  a  strip  with  a  pH

range  from  3  to  10,  the  OMP  proteins  mass  do  not  well  re-
solved.  Besides,  it  is  already  established  that  the  pH  range 
for OMP best resolutions is 4 to 7 [38].  

 
In the present study we identified in aEPEC by MALDI-
TOF-MS methodology proteins involved in the cell structure 
and biochemistry,  as well  as  in gene regulation and some of 
these  proteins  showed  similarity  with  proteins  identified  in 
other  E.  coli  pathotypes.  Furthermore,  these  findings  repre-
sent  the  first  analysis  of  outer  membrane  profiles  of  aEPEC 
and tEPEC belonging  to the O55 serogroup and should con-
tribute  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  genetic  and  bio-
chemical regulation of these strains.
