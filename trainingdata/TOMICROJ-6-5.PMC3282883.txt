Abstract:  The Enteritidis and Dublin serovars of Salmonella enterica are closely related, yet they differ significantly in 
pathogenicity  and  epidemiology.  S.  Enteritidis  is  a  broad  host  range  serovar  that  commonly  causes  gastroenteritis  and 
infrequently causes invasive disease in humans. S. Dublin mainly colonizes cattle but upon infecting humans often results 
in invasive disease.To gain a broader view of the extent of these differences we conducted microarray-based comparative 
genomics between several field isolates from each serovar. Genome degradation has been correlated with host adaptation 
in  Salmonella,  thus  we  also  compared  at  whole  genome  scale  the  available  genomic  sequences  of  them  to  evaluate 
pseudogene composition within each serovar. 

Microarray  analysis  revealed  3771  CDS  shared  by  both  serovars  while  33  were  only  present  in  Enteritidis  and  87  were 
exclusive to Dublin. Pseudogene evaluation showed 177 inactive CDS in S. Dublin which correspond to active genes in S. 
Enteritidis, nine of which are also inactive in the host adapted S. Gallinarum and S. Choleraesuis serovars. Sequencing of 
these  9  CDS  in  several  S.  Dublin  clinical  isolates  revealed  that  they  are  pseudogenes  in  all  of  them,  indicating  that  this 
feature  is  not  peculiar  to  the  sequenced  strain.  Among  these  CDS,  shdA  (Peyer´s  patch  colonization  factor)  and  mglA 
(galactoside transport ATP binding protein), appear also to be inactive in the human adapted S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A, 
suggesting  that  functionality  of  these  genes  may  be  relevant  for  the  capacity  of  certain  Salmonella  serovars  to  infect  a 
broad range of hosts.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Infection  with  non-typhoidal  Salmonella  enterica  is  a 
 
major  cause of food-borne disease in humans worldwide [1-
3].  Animals  and  their  products  are  regarded  as  the  main 
sources  of  this  pathogen,  although  it  may  also  be  present  in 
other potential sources,  such as fresh vegetables [4-6]. From 
over 2500 different serovars of Salmonella enterica (defined 
by their surface antigenic properties, both somatic O antigen 
and  flagellar  H  antigens)  about  50  are  significant  pathogens 
of  animals  and  humans.  Acute  infections  in  humans  can 
develop  in  one  of  four  ways:  enteric  fever,  gastroenteritis, 
bacteremia,  or  extraintestinal  focal  infection  [7].  As  with 
other  infectious  diseases,  the  course  and  outcome  of  the 
infection  depend  on  a  variety  of  factors,  including  the 
inoculating  dose,  the  immune  status  of  the  host,  and  the 
genetic  background  of  both  the  host  and  the  infecting 
organism. 

  Although  S.  enterica  serovars  are  genetically  very 
similar,  they  differ  significantly  in  host  range  and  disease

spectrum.  S.  enterica  serovars  may  be  classified  as 
ubiquitous,  host-restricted  or  host-specific.  Ubiquitous 
serovars,  which  include  Typhimurium  and  Enteritidis,  most 
commonly produce self-limiting gastrointestinal infections in 
a wide range of hosts. Host-specific  serovars, such  as  Typhi 
in  humans  or  Gallinarum  in  fowl,  cause  severe  systemic 
diseases  in  their  specific  hosts.  A  few  Salmonella  serovars, 
such  as  Choleraesuis  and  Dublin,  have  a  narrow  host  range 
and are classified as host-restricted [8]. 

  Host-restricted  and  host-specific  serovars  are  generally 
more prone to cause invasive disease than ubiquitous serovars 
[9,  10].  Globally,  human  extra-intestinal  salmonellosis  is 
generally  associated  with  those  serovars  that  are  also 
associated  with  gastroenteritis,  as  is  the  case  with  S. 
Enteritidis  and  S.  Typhimurium.  However,  certain  serovars 
are more prone to cause invasive infections than others, as is 
clear when the percentage of isolates from bacteremia related 
to  total  cases  (invasive  index)  is  calculated  [7,  11].  For  S. 
Typhimurium  and  S.  Enteritidis,  the  invasive  index  ranges 
from  1  to  7%  [11,  12],  while  for S.  Dublin  different  reports 
indicate  that  the  invasive  index  ranges  from  50%  to  70%  
[7,  11,  13-15].  Loss  of  gene  function  through  pseudogene 
accumulation  has  been  indicated  as  a  hallmark  of  host-

specific  pathogenic  bacteria  as  compared  to  their  host-
generalist relatives [16-22].  

  The  Enteritidis  (O:  1,  9,  12:  gm:  -)  and  Dublin  (O:1,  9, 
12:  gp:  -)  serovars  share  antigenic  properties  and  are 
phylogenetically  closely  related,  yet  they  seem  to  differ 
significantly  in  pathogenic  potential  [23,  24].  S.  Enteritidis 
commonly  causes  gastroenteritis  but  rarely  causes  invasive 
disease  in  humans.  S.  Dublin  usually  infects  cattle  causing 
abortion  and  systemic  infection,  but  occasionally  can  be 
found infecting other hosts such as pigs and humans. On the 
rare  occasions  when  it  infects  humans  it  often  results  in 
bacteraemia  with  severe  disease  and  high  mortality  [25-27]. 
Characterization  of 
these 
differences  is central  to a more general understanding of the 
invasiveness  of  salmonellae.  To  date  only  one  complete 
genome of a S. Enteritidis strain (P125109, hereafter referred 
as PT4) and two S. Dublin isolates (CT_02021853 and 3246) 
have been sequenced and annotated and are publicly available 
[28], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj/19467] [29].  

the  mechanisms  underlying 

  To  gain  new  insights  into  genetic  differences  that  could 
help  to  understand  the  basis  of  such  marked  different 
pathogenic  behaviors,  here  we  describe  a  comparative  study 
between  S.  Enteritidis  and  S.  Dublin.  We  conducted 
microarray-based  comparative  genomics  between  four  S. 
Dublin clinical isolates and the core genome resulting of the 
comparative  genome  analysis  of  29  S.  Enteritidis  isolates 
previously  reported  by  us  [30].  Further  the  pseudogene 
content  of  each  serovar  was  also  evaluated  using  the 
available genome sequences. 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1. Bacterial Strains 

  Twenty-nine S.  enterica  serovar  Enteritidis  isolates  from 
diverse origins in Uruguay were previously characterized by 
microarray and phenotypic assays [30, 31]. Seven S. enterica 
serovar  Dublin  isolates  from  human  infections  in  Uruguay 
were used in this study (Table 1).  

Isolates  were  maintained  frozen  at  -80°C 

 
in  LB 
containing 25% glycerol. Bacteria were cultured in LB broth, 
or  on  LB  containing  1.6%  agar,  or  Tryptic  Soy  Agar.  All 
isolates  were 
identified  as  Salmonella  enterica  using 
standard  biochemical  tests  and  microbiological  methods. 

Betancor et al. 

Serovar was determined by the slide agglutination test for O 
antigen  and  the  tube  agglutination  test  for  H  antigen,  using 
commercially  available  anti-O  and  anti-H  antisera  (Difco, 
France). Differentiation between S. Enteritidis and S. Dublin 
was  confirmed  by  PCR  for  the  detection  of  genetic  regions 
specific for Enteritidis [32] and by sequencing the fliC gene, 
which differs between these serovars.  

2.2.  Comparative  Genomic  Hybridization  Analysis 
(CGH) 

the 

from 

Four  S.  Dublin  strains  were  analyzed  by  CGH  using  the 
 
Salmonella  generation  IV  microarray  [30,  33,  34]  with  PT4 
DNA  [28]  as  reference.  The  array  is  non-redundant  and 
contains  coding  sequences 
following  eight 
genomes:  S.  enterica  serovar  Typhi  (S.  Typhi)  CT18,  S. 
Typhi  Ty2,  S.  Typhimurium  LT2  (ATCC  700220),  S. 
Typhimurium  DT104  (NCTC  13348),  S.  Typhimurium 
SL1344 (NCTC 13347), S. Enteritidis PT4 P125109 (NCTC 
13349),  S.  Gallinarum  287/91  (NCTC  13346),  and  S. 
bongori  12419  (ATCC  43975).  Total  DNA  (including 
plasmid  DNA)  was  extracted  from  each  strain  using  a 
Genome  DNA  extraction  kit  (Promega)  and  quantified  by 
agarose  gel  electrophoresis.  Labeled  DNA 
from  S. 
Enteritidis  PT4  (control  sample)  and  one  of  the  query 
Salmonella  strains  (experimental  sample)  were  mixed  in 
equal  volumes  and  concentrations  and  hybridized  to  the 
microarray  slides  as  previously  described  [30].  Data  were 
normalized  to  the  median  value,  and  the  total  list  of  6,871 
genes  was  filtered  by  removing  those  spots  with  a  high 
background  and  those  without  data  in  at  least  one  of  the 
replicates  (three  slides  per  strain,  duplicate  features  per 
slide). After filtering, a list of 5,695 genes was obtained that 
corresponded to genes that presented a valid signal in at least 
one of the strains analyzed. Data  analysis was performed on 
Excel files, following criteria previously described [30]. 

  Genes  assigned  as  absent/divergent  in  all  S.  Dublin 
isolates  were  compared  to  the  core  genome  of S.  Enteritidis 
as  defined  in  our  previous  study  [30].  Genes  detected  as 
present  in  all  S.  Dublin  isolates  but  absent  in  S.  Enteritidis 
PT4  were  compared  with  the  S.  Enteritidis  dispensable 
genome  as  well  as  with  the  fully  sequenced  Salmonella 
isolates  available  in  the  NCBI  database.  Genes  encoded  in 
plasmids were not considered in this analysis.

3. RESULTS 

3.1.  Microarray-based  Comparative  Genomics  of  S. 
Enteritidis and S. Dublin Isolates 

  The  genetic  content  of  the  4  S.  Dublin  isolates  was 
evaluated  by  microarray  and  a  core  genome  (i.e.  genes 
present  in  all  strains)  was  defined.  To  explore  the  genetic 
determinants  underlying  the  phenotypic  differences  between 
S.  Dublin  and  S.  Enteritidis,  we  compared  the  core  genome 
of  S.  Dublin  with  the  previously  defined  core  genome  of  S. 
Enteritidis  [30].  We  found  3771  genes  shared  by  both 
serovars,  whereas  33  genes  were  only  present 
in  S. 
Enteritidis  strains  (Table 3)  and  87  genes  were  only  present 
in  S.  Dublin  isolates  (Table  4).  The  regions  of  difference 
found  by  CGH  analysis  are  similar  to  the  regions  of 
difference  obtained  from  comparison  of  the  genomes  of  the 
two  sequenced  strains  PT4  and  CT_02021853  (results  not 
shown). From these 120 (33 + 87) genes which are exclusive 
of one serovar or the other, 53 are bacteriophage-encoded.  

  As shown in Table 3 four DNA regions and seven single 
genes  were  present  only  in  S.  Enteritidis.  Region  En1 
(SEN083-SEN085)  encodes  two  putative  secreted  proteins 
and  one  sulphatase.  BLAST  analysis  revealed  that  this 
region  has  homologues  in  several  fully  sequenced  serovars 
of  Salmonella, 
including  S.  Gallinarum,  S.  Typhi,  S. 
Paratyphi A, S. Paratyphi B, S. Choleraesuis, S. Typhimurium, 
S.  Agona,  S.  Newport  and  S.  Heidelberg.  Region  En2 
(SEN1379-1395),  corresponds  to  phage  SE14  [28],  that 
includes  genes  encoding  for  DNA  nucleases  and  membrane 
proteins,  and  was  previously  postulated  to  be  a  region  of 
difference  between  S.  Enteritidis  and  all  other  Salmonella 

Betancor et al. 

serovars [30, 36] . Region En3 (SEN1432-1435) corresponds 
to a genomic island previously described as ROD13 [28] that 
encodes for idonate dehydrogenase, gluconate dehydrogenase, 
proteins  involved  in  sugar  transport,  and  proteins  similar  to 
those  required  for  hexonate  uptake.  This  genomic  island  is 
present  in the S. Gallinarum genome  sequence, but is  absent 
from  all  other  salmonellae  sequenced  to  date.  Region  En4 
(SEN1500-1506)  corresponds  to  part  of  another  genomic 
region,  named  ROD14  [28],  and  encodes  for  a  putative 
transcriptional  regulator  akin  to  the  LacI  family,  and  other 
regulatory  proteins  probably  involved  in  drug  efflux.  This 
region  is  present  in  the  genome  sequences  from  various  S. 
Typhimurium  strains,  but  is  degraded  in  the  S.  Gallinarum 
and PT4 genome sequences. 

 
Six  regions  and  six  isolated  genes  are  present  only  in S. 
Dublin  (Table  4).  Region  Du1  comprises  thirteen  genes 
previously  annotated  within  the  genome  of  S.  Gallinarum 
(SG1032-1044)  which  include  proteins  that  are  members  of 
the  Rhs family, Clp proteases and exported proteins. Region 
Du2  (SG1182-1195  and  SG1211-1219)  corresponds  to  part 
of the Gifsy-2-like prophage remnant present in the genome 
of  S.  Gallinarum  [28].  Region  Du3  corresponds  to  genes 
found in SPI-6 from S. Typhi CT18.  

  Regions  Du4,  Du5  and  Du6,  correspond  to  prophages 
found in the genome sequence of S. Typhi CT18 [16]. Single 
genes  present  only  in S.  Dublin  strains  include  a  membrane 
transport  protein  (SG3368),  a  putative  glycolate  oxidase 
(STY1444) and several phage-related proteins. 

  Microarray  methodology  allowed  us  to  detect  only 
presence  or  absence/divergence  of  genes,  but  not  small

variations  in  gene  sequences.  Considering  that  pseudogene 
accumulation  has  been  postulated  to  be  involved  in  host 
restriction  and  adaptation,  we  decided  to  compare  the 
pseudogene content  among the  available genomic sequences 
of  both  serovars  and  then  evaluate  if  the  Uruguayan  S.

respectively.  From 

  Analysis  of  the  genomes  available  in  the  NCBI  database 
for  S.  Dublin  CT_02021853  and  S.  Enteritidis  PT4  strains, 
show  that  they  have  289  CDS  and  111  CDS  annotated  as 
pseudogenes 
the  289  S.  Dublin 
pseudogenes,  7  have  no  homologues  in  the  S.  Enteritidis 
sequence,  and  32  correspond  to  intergenic  regions.  Among 
the  others,  38  are  homologous  with  29  pseudogenes  in  S. 
Enteritidis,  whereas  the  other  212  pseudogenes  in S.  Dublin 
correspond to 177 active genes in S. Enteritidis. Conversely, 
there  are  83  S.  Enteritidis  pseudogenes  that  appear  to  be 
functional  in  S.  Dublin  CT_02021853.  We  analyzed  the 
pseudogenes  specific  of  each  serovar,  and  grouped  them  in 
different  classes  according  with 
their  homology  with 
functional CDS (Table 5).  

S. Enteritidis, S. Dublin and S. Gallinarum form a related 
 
cluster  of  serovars  but  with  marked  differences  in  host-
specificity,  thus  we  also  included  S.  Gallinarum  in  the 
pseudogene  analysis.  There  is  a  single  annotated  genome 
sequence for this serovar that contains 309 pseudogenes [28] 
and  among  them  only  21  are  also  annotated  as  pseudogenes 

in S. Dublin but not in S. Enteritidis (Table 6). This group of 
CDS  includes  nine  that  are  also  inactive  (7)  or  completely 
absent (2) in the other host-restricted serovar S. Choleraesuis 
[37] and are described in Table 6.

restricted  serovars,  thus  we  decided  to  evaluate  their 
sequences in all S. Dublin Uruguayan isolates obtained from 
human  infections  (4  strains  analyzed  by  CGH  as  described 
above  plus  3  other  isolates,  Table  1).  We  found  that  all  
7  isolates  have  these  9  CDS  inactivated  as  pseudogenes, 
either  by  the  same  point  mutations  that  are  present  in  the 
fully  sequenced  S.  Dublin  CT_02021853  strain  (7  of  the  9 
CDS)  or  by  a  different  deletion  as  is  the  case  of  the  CDS 
homologous  to  SEN2493  and  SEN4290.  Recently  the 
genome  sequence  of  another  S.  Dublin  strain  (S.  Dublin 
3246),  was  publicly  released  (GenBank:  CM001151)  [29]. 
We found that all 9 CDS are also pseudogenes in this strain. 
Further,  in  all  but  one  of  them  the  inactivation  is  due  to  the 
same changes than in S. Dublin CT_02021853. Interestingly, 
the  exception  is  the CDS corresponding to SEN4290, which 
possess  the  same  deletion  than  the  Uruguayan  strains 
analyzed here. 

DISCUSSION 

S.  Enteritidis  and  S.  Dublin  are  two  closely  related 
 
serovar  with  marked  differences  in  pathogenic  traits  and 
epidemiological  behavior,  thus  it  is  reasonable  to  assume 

that  genomic  comparison  between  them  could  shed  some 
light  on  the  molecular  basis  of  these  differences.  A  single 
previous  report  described  a  microarray-based  genome 
comparison  [38],  and  here  we  conducted  a  similar  analysis 
using  a  different  set  of  field  isolates  and  microarray  chip. 
Further,  we  now  report  a  comparison  of  the  full  genome 
sequences of S. Enteritidis and S. Dublin particularly looking 
at differences in pseudogene composition between them. 

  Our  comparative  genome  hybridization  study  predicted 
33  genes  specific  to  S.  Enteritidis  and  87  specific  to  S. 
Dublin. The analysis revealed four genetic regions and seven 
single  genes  that  seem  to  be  exclusive  of S.  Enteritidis  core 
genome,  as  well  as  six  regions  and  six  single  genes  specific 
for  S.  Dublin.  These  results  corroborate  and  extend  the 
previous  report  where  3  S.  Dublin  and  24  S.  Enteritidis 
strains where compared [38]. This report described the same 
four regions specific for Enteritidis but only one of the six S. 
Dublin  regions  found  by  us.  This  particular  region,  that  we 
denominated  Du3,  corresponds  to  regions  B24,  B25_a  and 
B25_b  as  of  the  earlier  report.  Region  Du3  corresponds  to 
genes  found  in  SPI-6  from  S.  Typhi  CT18.  This  region 
encodes  a  ClpB  heat-shock  protease-like  protein,  as  well  as

different  membrane  proteins  and  lipoproteins  that  belong  to 
the  T6SS  encoded  in  this  island.  Interestingly,  this  region 
includes  a  gene  in  the  rhs  family  (STY0321)  that  has  no 
homologue in the CT_02021853 genome sequence.

recently  proposed 

  Among the other regions specific for S. Dublin described 
here,  Region  Du1  was 
to  be  a 
pathogenicity  island  (SPI-19)  identified  in S.  Gallinarum, S. 
Dublin,  S.  Weltevreden  and S.  Agona  that  encodes  a  type-6 
secretion  system  (T6SS)  [39].  In  S.  Enteritidis,  an  internal 
deletion  has  eliminated  most  of  the  island.  Region  Du2, 
includes 
proteins, 
recombinases,  transposases,  and  structural  proteins.  It  also 
includes  one  gene  (SG1186)  previously  annotated  as 
encoding  a  putative  phage-encoded  cell  division  inhibitor 
protein belonging to the kil super-family and associated with 
the  capacity  to  inhibit  the  essential  ftsZ  cell-division  gene 
[40]. ftsZ expression  is altered during  the  intracellular phase 
of infection with S. enterica, a process that is independent of 
sulA, a known inhibitor of ftsZ [41]. Genes encoding proteins 
belonging  to  the  same  super-family  are  also  present  in 
several  S.  Typhi  genome  sequences,  as  well  as  in  other 
enterobacteria (e.g. different STEC strains, Shigella flexneri, 
Shigella  dysenteriae  and  others)  as  revealed  by  Blast-p 
analysis,  suggesting  a  possible  role  for  these  proteins  in 
pathogenesis. Regions Du1 and Du2 were not represented in 
the  microarray  used  by  Porwollik  and  collaborators  [38], 
thus  we  cannot  exclude  that  these  regions  were  also  present 
in the strains studied  there, but simply not found because of 
the  particular  microarray  used.  Regions  Du4,  Du5  and  Du6, 
correspond to prophages found in the genome sequence of S. 
Typhi  CT18  [16].  Region  Du4  comprises  17  genes  from  a 
lambdoid  bacteriophage  that  include  several  CDS  encoding 
for DNA binding proteins. Region Du5 includes 3 genes that 
are  part  of  a  degenerate  bacteriophage;  one  of  these 
(STY2044)  encodes  a  putative  endolysin  similar  to  several 
lysozymes  from  E.  coli  and  Shigella  strains.  Region  Du6 
spans  10  genes  including  a  DNA  adenine  methylase 
(STY3667),  regulatory  proteins  and  endonucleases.  These  3 
regions  of  difference  were  not  found  in  the  earlier  report, 
despite the CDS been present in the microarray. Instead, that 
work  reported  differences  in  other  prophage-derived  genes. 
Thus, it could that the genomes of the particular set of strains 
used  in  both  studies  posses  different  prophage  composition. 
The  analysis  of  Du4-Du5-Du6  in  both  S.  Dublin  sequenced 
isolates,  revealed  that  regions  Du5  and  Du6  are  very 
conserved  in  both  strains  whereas  region  Du4  is  almost 
complete 
less 
conserved  in  strain  3246,  supporting  the  hypothesis  of 
different content in phage genes among S. Dublin isolates.  

in  CT_  02021853  but 

incomplete  and 

  Among  the  seven  single  genes  that  are  for  the  first  time 
described  here  as  absent 
in  S.  Dublin  strains,  safA 
(SEN0281)  and  dcp  (SEN1539)  are  of  special  interest. safA 
is  the  first  gene  of  the  saf  fimbrial  operon  and  encodes  a 
lipoprotein.  The  operon  forms  part  of 
the  degraded 
pathogenicity island SPI-6 in the S. Enteritidis  chromosome. 
This  operon  is  not  annotated  in  the  S.  Dublin  genome 
sequences  available.  However,  Blast  analysis  revealed  that 
this  is  a  region  highly  conserved  at  a  nucleotide  level 
between  PT4  and  both  S.  Dublin  sequenced  isolates.  There 
are  several  stop  codons 
the  S.  Dublin  sequence 
homologous  to  safA,  suggesting  that  this  gene  is  in  process 

in 

of degradation. The fact that we cannot detect safA by  CGH 
in the S. Dublin Uruguayan isolates may be related with this. 
The  dcp  gene  encodes  for  dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase  II, 
which  is  highly  conserved  among  the  Enterobacteriaceae. 
This  gene  has  been  described  previously  as  a  frequent  site 
for  SNPs  in  S.  Enteritidis  [42],  and  it  is  absent  from  the 
CT_02021853 sequence. 

  Overall, 
the  CGH  analyses  did  not  detect  clear 
differences  in  genes  that  have  been  previously  reported  as 
required  for  virulence 
in 
pathogenicity  of  both  serovars.  However,  the  presence/ 
absence of a gene, as detected by this methodology, does not 
inform  about  its  expression,  thus  these  results  should  be 
interpreted with caution. 

the  differences 

to  explain 

in 
  The  high  number  of  pseudogenes  detected 
CT_02021853  suggests  that  this  mechanism  might  be 
relevant  in  the  process  of  host  adaptation  of  this  serovar,  as 
well  as  in  the  different  epidemiological  and  pathogenic 
behavior  of  S.  Dublin  when  compared  with  S.  Enteritidis.  
As  we  describe  in  Table  5,  we  observed  a  differential 
distribution  of  functionality  amongst  the  CDS  inactive  in S. 
Enteritidis and S. Dublin. More than 40% of the pseudogenes 
specific  for  S.  Enteritidis  correspond  to  CDS  related  to 
phages or  transposases but only 12% with those  involved  in 
metabolism  and  regulatory  proteins.  Conversely,  among  the 
pseudogenes  specific  for S.  Dublin  33%  correspond  to  CDS 
encoding  proteins 
in  central  metabolism  or 
regulatory  proteins  and  37%  to  CDS  related  to  surface 
structures  but  only  3%  to  phages  and  transposases.  These 
observations  may  be  relevant  to  understand 
the  host 
restriction of S. Dublin. 

involved 

  We  found  21  CDS  that  appear  to  be  active  genes  in  the 
broad  host-range S.  Enteritidis  but  pseudogenes  in  the  host-
restricted  S.  Dublin  and  in  the  host-specific  S.  Gallinarum. 
From this set of CDS, 9 are pseudogenes as well in the other 
host-restricted  serovar  S.  Cholerasuis  suggesting  that  their 
inactivation could be relevant as genetic determinants of host 
adaptation.  These  nine  CDS  correspond  to  two  hypothetical 
proteins  (SEN0784  and  SEN2783),  one  putative  transport 
protein  (SEN0042),  the  gene  encoding  the  outer  membrane 
usher  protein  LpfC  (SEN3461),  one  probable  phospho- 
transferase system permease (SEN3672), one gene  encoding 
a  putative  Type  I  restriction  modification  system  protein 
(SEN4290),  and  the  gene  encoding  a  probable  glucarate 
dehydratase 2 (SEN2806 or ygcY).  The other two genes  that 
complete this list are mglA (SEN2182) and shdA (SEN2493), 
which  are  pseudogenes  in  S.  Typhi  CT18  and  Ty2  as  well  
as  in  S.  Paratyphi  A  ATCC  9150  and  S.  Paratyphi  A 
AKU_12601  [22].  ShdA  is  involved  in  colonization  of 
Peyer’s  patches  by  S.  Typhimurium  and  in  shedding  of  the 
bacteria  after  infection  [43-45].  MglA  is  a  galactoside 
transport  ATP  binding  protein.  The  roles  of  these  genes  
in  the  broad  host-range  of  S.  Enteritidis  remain  to  be 
established.  

  All  these  nine  CDS  are  pseudogenes  in  the  seven  S. 
Dublin  clinical  isolates  evaluated  in  this  work,  as  well  as  in 
the other fully  sequenced  isolate S. Dublin 3246, suggesting 
that  the  lost  of  their  functionality  is  not  a  consequence  of 
random  mutation.  Two  of  these  9  pseudogenes  in  the 
Uruguayan isolates have lost their functionality by mutations 

12    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2012, Volume 6 

that  are  different  from  those  seen  in  the  sequenced  strain 
CT_02021853  suggesting  that  this  loose  of  functionality 
involves a process of convergent evolution. 

In  conclusion,  our 

 
results  show  several  genetic 
differences  that  may  help  to  explain  why  such  close  related 
organisms  can  nevertheless  behave  with  such  marked 
differences. Comparison of larger numbers of field strains at 
full  genome  scale  is  becoming  increasingly  feasible,  and 
may  provide  new  insights  into  the  genetic  basis  of  host 
adaptation.
