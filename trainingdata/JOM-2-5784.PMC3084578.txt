Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontal disease (PD) have shown similar physiopathologic mechanisms
such as chronic inflammation with adjacent bone resorption in an immunogenetically susceptible host;
however, PD has a well-recognized bacterial etiology while the cause of RA is unclear. Some reports have
indicated that an infectious agent in a susceptible host could be one possible trigger factor for RA, and it has
been suggested that oral microorganisms, specialty periodontal bacteria could be the infectious agent (mainly
Porphyromonas gingivalis). It has been reported that PD is more frequent and more severe in patients with
RA, suggesting a positive association between both diseases. There have been reports regarding the detection
of antibodies against periodontal bacteria while other studies have identified periodontal bacterial DNA in
serum and synovial fluid of RA patients and have explored the possible pathways of transport of periodontal
bacterial DNA. In conclusion, there is no question that RA and PD have pathologic features in common and
there is strong evidence of an association between both diseases, but further studies, including experimental
models, are needed to demonstrate the arthritogenicity of oral microorganisms.

Periodontal disease (PD) is one of the most common

chronic disorders of infectious origin known in
humans with a prevalence of 1060% in adults
depending on the diagnostic criteria (1). It includes gin-
givitis, an inflammatory condition of the soft tissues
surrounding the tooth and periodontitis that involves loss
of alveolar bone. Patients affected by PD respond to
bacterial dental plaque biofilm by mobilizing their defen-
sive cells and releasing cytokines like interleukin-1b,
tumor necrosis factor-a, and interleukin-6, which lead
to tissue destruction by stimulating the production
of the collagenolytic enzymes: matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) (2).

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is considered an autoim-
mune disease and while genetic factors are important in
the development of
the disease, not all susceptible
patients develop RA (3, 4). RA is characterized by
inflammation of the synovial membrane, leading to an
invasion of the synovial tissue into the adjacent cartilage
matrix with degradation of the articular cartilage and

bone destruction. It affects approximately 1% of the adult
population and environmental factors have also been
shown to play a role in the etiology of RA (5). It has been
proposed that synovial and adjacent soft tissue inflam-
mation may be initiated by a number of microbial factors,
including bacterial DNA, CpG motifs, heat
shock
proteins, and lipopolysaccharides (69). The thought
that RA may be triggered by an unknown infectious agent
has been a longstanding concept in its pathogenesis. It has
been well established that in the case of refractory
RA, infectious agents triggering joint inflammation are
involved. Gastrointestinal and urogenital bacterial species
such as Yersinia, Salmonella, Camphylobacter, Shigella,
and Chlamydia have all been associated with RA (1015).
The pathophysiological mechanisms of cartilage and
bone destruction in RA are not exactly understood.
However, it is known that MMPs, cathepsins, and osteo-
clast activation contribute to bone resorption (16, 17).
A number of cytokines like TNF-a, IL-1, and macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) are also involved (18).

Epidemiological association between
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontal
disease (PD)
There have been recent reports suggesting a significant
association between RA and PD (19, 20). The hypothesis
that RA is an infectious disease has been postulated
for over 70 years (21). It is proposed that RA patients
have direct contact with microorganisms and their viru-
lence factors, which activate an immune response in the
synovial membrane with the accumulation of immuno-
competent T- and B-cells. This reaction is mediated by
neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes (both T and
B), leading to the release of proteinases, cytokines, and
prostaglandins that stimulate osteoclast activity and bone
resorption (22). While some reports have indicated that an
infectious agent in a susceptible host could be one possible
trigger factor for RA (23), the published studies vary
widely with respect to study design and methods used for
the diagnoses of RA and PD, which in turn make it
difficult to ascertain the association between RA and PD.
The clinical designs most commonly used were case-
control and cross-sectional studies with the main concern
being the criteria used to define control subjects. Most of
the volunteers were recruited from the staff at the study
centers or were patients attending dental clinics, such that
the results of these studies need to be treated with caution.
trials have shown that
individuals with RA are more likely to experience
moderate to severe PD compared with healthy subjects,
while others have reported a high incidence of RA in
patients with periodontitis. There is evidence that RA
patients have deeper periodontal pockets (OR2.47) and
greater severity of periodontitis (OR2.27) (24). In a
recent case-control study that involved 57 RA patients
and 52 healthy subjects, RA patients showed a positive
association (OR8.05) with PD (25).

Some prospective clinical

Common pathophysiologic mechanisms
The fact that RA and PD have similar physiopathologic
mechanisms, such as chronic inflammation with adjacent
bone resorption, has led some authors to suggest that RA
and PD are a variety of the same disease. Both are
chronic inflammatory reactions in an immunogenetically
susceptible host (19); however, PD has a well-recognized
bacterial etiology while on the other hand the cause of
RA is unclear. It has been accepted that many different
arthritogenic stimuli exist that could include exogenous
infectious factors (26) or endogenous substances such as
connective tissue proteins (collagens and proteoglycans)
and altered immunoglobulins resulting in an autoimmune
response (22).

Periodontal bacteria are able to activate immunologi-
cal responses by different mechanisms; one such mechan-
ism includes the ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to
produce a peptidyl arginine deaminase enzyme (PAD),

which leads to citrullination of host proteins and the
production of putative autoantigens (20). At the same
time, antibodies against heat shock proteins (hsp 70) of
Prevotella nigrescens and Prevotella intermedia have been
found in synovial fluid of patients with RA possibly
triggering an immune response (27, 28). It has also been
reported that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are
directly associated with RA and PD. These are powerful
risk factors for both diseases, further suggesting a close
connection. The main HLA marker for both diseases is
the highly polymorphic HLA-DRB1 locus (29, 30).

Another possible biological link is the fact that IL-1
cytokines are the main mediators of
the immune
response, inflammation, and tissue destruction in both
diseases. There are increased levels of IL-1b in synovial
tissue macrophages and gingival crevicular fluid in
patients with RA and PD (22). Studies in animal models
have shown high levels of tissue MMPs, tumor necrosis
factor-a, and IL-1b in both diseases indicating a similar
pattern of tissue destruction (31).

Mechanisms of tissue destruction in rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) and periodontal disease (PD)
The mechanisms of alveolar bone destruction in PD and
articular surfaces in RA are similar. There is an over-
production of a variety of cytokines and MMPs that
appear to be common in both diseases (22). PD and RA
both have persistent high levels of proinflammatory
cytokines, including IL-1b and tumor necrosis factor-
alpha (TNF-a), and low levels of cytokines that suppress
the immunoinflammatory response such as IL-10 and
transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) (32). These cyto-
kines, together with low levels of metalloproteinases
inhibitors (TIMPs), and high levels of MMPs and
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are associated with disease
activity (22).

The link between periodontal disease (PD) and
rheumatoid arthritis (RA): oral bacteria
Most of the clinical studies that have implicated specific
infective triggers for RA have relied on serological
methods to detect prior exposure to bacteria or to viruses.
These studies have either detected antibodies against a
target microorganism or identified genetic material
in
blood or synovial fluid (3337). There have been studies
exploring the association of periodontopathogenic bac-
teria with RA, these were mainly focused on the detection
of antibodies against the different bacteria associated
with periodontitis in both synovial fluid and serum,
Table 1. In a case-control study, serum antibodies against
disease-producing periodontal bacteria were identified
more frequently in subjects affected by RA and period-
ontitis than control subjects (38, 39). In particular anti-P.
gingivalis, antibodies have been reported to be more
frequent in RA subjects compared with controls and that

the titer of RA-related autoantibodies and C-reactive
protein concentrations are also higher in individuals
infected with P. gingivalis suggesting that this organism
plays a role in disease risk and progression in RA (40).

On the other hand,

it has been proposed that the
detection of bacterial DNA in the synovial fluid of RA
patients is more important than the detection of anti-
bodies as it suggests the transport of bacterial DNA from
sites of infection to the joints of RA patients. Recently,
there have been reports that have focused on the detection
of bacterial DNA in RA-affected joints using checker-
board DNADNA-hybridization or PCR assays (39, 41).
In this context, it has been reported that P. gingivalis,
Tannerella forsythia, and P. intermedia have been identi-
fied in synovial fluid samples from RA and psoriatic
arthritis patients using the checkerboard DNADNA-
hybridization assay (39). A recent cross-sectional study
involving 19 subjects with periodontitis and refractory
RA (these patients received intensive treatment with
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs DMARDs: meth-
otrexate, sulfasazine, leflunomide, and chloroquine) has
shown that P. intermedia (89.4%), P. gingivalis (57.8%),
and P. nigrescens (21.0%), were frequently detected with
PCR (41). These two studies clearly demonstrate that

chromosomal DNA from bacteria associated with PD is
present in serum and synovial fluid from patients with
RA. Although bacterial DNA might be associated with
chronic inflammation of the joints,
it remains to be
determined whether these microbial factors are a cause or
are a result of the disease.

Synovial inflammation facilitates trapping of oral
bacterial DNA
In the early stages of PD, the epithelium ulcerates to
expose the underlying connective tissues and vasculature
to the subgingival biofilm, this then provides for the entry
of periodontopathic into the bloodstream during eating
and brushing (42, 43). It is well established that patients
affected by PD have frequent episodes of bacteremia. The
frequency of bacteremia after ultrasonic scaling is 13%,
after periodontal probing 20%, and after tooth brushing
it is 3% (42).

Finally, it has been reported that synovial inflamma-
tion in the joint affected by RA favors trapping of oral
bacterial DNAs (39). Hence, it is unknown whether the
presence of oral bacteria in the inflamed joint is a cause
or a result of the inflammation.

Pathways of transport of bacterial DNA
There could be three possible pathways of transport of
periodontal bacterial DNA from periodontal sites to the
synovium:

1. As whole viable cells leading to infection in the
joint and reactivation of RA in spite of rheumatic
treatment.

2. Via intracellular capture by immune cells, as evi-
denced by the fact that synovial fluid contains
phagocytosed material including IgG, IgM, rheu-
matoid factor, fibrin, antinuclear factors, immune
complexes, and DNA particles.

3. Via free DNA transportation in the bloodstream

(39).

A number of different experiments have been carried out
to probe these potential pathways. These include inocu-
lation of synovial fluid in different culture media, under
aerobic, and anaerobic conditions. As no bacterial
growth was detected, these results suggest that there were
no viable bacterial cells in the samples studied. Isolated
leukocytes from whole blood have also been tested by
PCR to detect bacterial DNA and, again, there were no
positive samples to any periodontal bacterial species
studied suggesting that DNA does not
from
periodontal sites to joints inside immune cells. In the
absence of these two possible mechanisms,
it would
appear that the transport of bacterial DNA is as free
DNA (41).

P. gingivalis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
P. gingivalis is the main organism associated with chronic
PD. It is a gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, the fimbriae
of which allow binding of the bacterial cell to host
proteins (44).

The IgG and IgA antibody levels against P. gingivalis,
together with other periodontopathic organisms such as
P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and T. forsythia were higher in
serum and synovial fluid from RA patients when com-
pared with controls. The presence of these antibodies
could be important in the etiopathogenesis of RA and
could represent a potential connection between period-
ontal and joint diseases (38, 45). On the other hand, it has
been reported that the same level of IgG antibody against
P. gingivalis occurs in serum of patients with a rapidly
progressive form of periodontitis, RA, chronic period-
ontitis, and a control group (34). These authors did not
detect differences between RA subjects and the control
group, although this could be attributed to the study
design and the small sample size involved (34).

As mentioned previously, RA is an autoimmune disease
showing a reaction to citrullinated proteins. Citrullina-
tion, also termed deamination,
is a modification of
arginine side chains catalyzed by peptidylarginine deami-
nase (PAD) enzymes. This posttranslational modification
has the potential to alter the structure, antigenicity, and
function of proteins. In RA, antibodies to cyclic citrulli-
nated peptides are used in clinical diagnosis. The citrulli-
nated antigens are: fibrinogen, vimentin, collagen type II,
and alpha-enolase, all of which are expressed in the joint.
Antibodies to citrullinated fibrinogen and collagen type II
mediate inflammation by the formation of
immune
complexes, both in human and animal models, Table 2
(46). P. gingivalis produces a microbial enzyme, equivalent
to the human PAD enzyme. It has been thought to
represent a susceptibility factor for RA. The antigens
generated by this enzyme lead the production of rheuma-
toid factor and local inflammation of both the gingivae
and synovium (20). PAD leads to the citrullination of
putative RA autoantigen such as fibrin in the synovium,
which in association with major histocompatibility com-
plex molecules and antigen-presenting cells, leads to the

production of anti-CCP antibody (47). In addition, it has
been suggested that the immune response to P. gingivalis
may be involved in breaking immune tolerance to
citrullinated antigens (48, 49). As well there are reports
of a similarity of sequence and cross-reactivity with
bacterial enolase (50).

chronic

Some studies have investigated the association between
P. gingivalis and RA in animal models. One recent study, in
which heat-killed P. gingivalis was injected into the backs
of DA rats, has shown that P. gingivalis promotes the
development of arthritis as measured by paw swelling (51).
This study clearly showed that a pre-existing, extra-
synovial
inflammatory lesion induced by
P. gingivalis promotes the development of arthritis in an
animal model (51). In another study, P. gingivalis and
Aggregatibacter actinomyctemcomitans were used to in-
duce periodontal disease in a mouse model. It was
observed that in a genetically susceptible mouse strain
the reaction was associated with higher levels of TNF-a,
IL-1b, IL-17, MMP-13, and RANKL, suggesting a shared
hyperinflammatory genotype and functional interferences
in innate and adaptive immune responses (31).

Another possible mechanism to explain the association
between P. gingivalis and RA is its effect on cell cycle
progression and apoptosis of human articular chondro-
cytes. Studies have shown that P. gingivalis can adhere to
and infect primary human chondrocytes affecting cell
cycle progression. In this context, P. gingivalis might
contribute to the tissue damage seen in RA (52). It has
also been shown that P. gingivalis can cause cell apoptosis
and the breakdown of extracellular matrices into macro-
molecular fragments. Fibronectin fragments are asso-
ciated with disease severity in both RA and PD but the
mechanism is unclear, Table 2 (53).

It has been reported that interleukin-17 (IL-17), a
proinflammatory cytokine secreted by the CD4() Th17
subset, contributes to bone destruction in RA but, at the
same time, it is essential in the host innate immune defense
against pathogens such as P. gingivalis (54). While recent
evidence has shown that Th17 cells are more osteoclasto-
genic than other T helper subsets such as Th1 or Th2 and
ablation of IL-17 signaling prior to the onset of infection
with P. gingivalis increases susceptibility to periodontal
bone loss (55), IL-17RA deficient mice showed enhanced
periodontal bone destruction suggesting a bone-protective
role for IL-17 (54).

Finally, IgG antibodies to the 40-kD heat shock protein,
from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are signifi-
cantly higher in RA sera than in the sera of healthy
controls (28). Other bacteria such as Staphylococcus
aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis have also been
cited as possible bacterial etiologic agents in late prosthetic
infections in RA patients (56, 57). It is also interesting to
note that both of these bacterial species can be found in the
mouths of some people.

RA and oral bacteria

Control of periodontal infection reduces active
rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
Recent studies have shown that control of periodontal
infection and inflammation by means of scaling, root
planing, and oral hygiene in subjects with moderate and
severe PD might contribute to a reduction in the signs
and symptoms of active RA in terms of a reduction in the
serum levels of TNF-a (58). In addition, recent clinical
trials have suggested that the treatment of PD might have
an important impact on RA severity (5860).

Dual purpose therapies based on
biological links
Tetracyclines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), and biphosphonates (61) have all been used
in the treatment of both RA and PD. Tetracyclines are
active against gram-negative and gram-positive organ-
isms and have also been shown to inhibit the collagenase
activity of MMPs (20). These enzymes are responsible for
bone destruction in both diseases and it has been
reported that MMPs have an enhanced activity in the
synovium of patients with RA (62). Therefore, it follows
that tetracyclines may be useful in patients with RA and
PD, since they are effective against the putative micro-
organisms implicated in periodontitis and possibly in RA
and also in decreasing bone destruction by inhibiting
MMPs (63, 64).

NSAIDs act by inhibiting cycloxygenase, the enzyme
responsible for the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Period-
ontally diseased tissues have high prostaglandin levels,
which are considered to be important mediators of bone
resorption in periodontitis (65). NSAIDs are commonly
used in the treatment of RA to reduce pain and inflamma-
tion. Some NSAIDs can directly inhibit the activation and
function of neutrophils (66), and can inhibit TNF-a
release from monocytes and natural killer cells (67). These
cycloxygenase independent effects may contribute to the
efficacy of NSAIDs in the treatment of RA.

Conclusions
There is no question that PD and RA have many
pathologic features in common. In the last few decades,
periodontal research has provided strong evidence for a
correlation between elevated concentrations of serum
antibodies against periodontal pathogens and disease
severity (34, 45, 68, 69). At the same time, some studies
have attempted to identify periodontopathic bacteria in
serum and synovial fluid samples from patients with RA
using molecular biological assays (39, 41). At the present
time however, the detection of microorganisms (viable
replicating form) or bacterial DNA in the synovium is
not necessarily indicative of an active role in the
pathogenesis of RA. While emerging evidence suggests
a strong association between the extent and severity of
PD in patients affected by RA,
this relationship is

unlikely to be causal. Experimental models, especially
animal models, need to be established to demonstrate the
arthritogenicity of oral microorganisms more definitively.
