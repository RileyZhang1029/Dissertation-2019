The Serotonin-6 Receptor as  
a Novel Therapeutic Target

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter that is found in both the central and peripheral nervous 
systems. 5-HT mediates its diverse physiological responses through 7 different 5-HT receptor families: 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 
5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. Among them, the 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R) is the most recently cloned serotonin receptor and 
plays important roles in the central nervous system (CNS) and in the etiology of neurological diseases. Compared to other 5-HT 
receptors, the 5-HT6R has been considered as an attractive CNS therapeutic target because it is expressed exclusively in the CNS and 
has no known isoforms. This review evaluates in detail the role of the 5-HT6R in the physiology and pathophysiology of the CNS 
and the potential usefulness of 5-HT6R ligands in the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CNS disorders. 
Preclinical studies provide support for the use of 5-HT6R ligands as promising medications to treat the cognitive dysfunction 
associated with Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, depression, and anxiety.

SEROTONIN (5-HT) AND 5-HT RECEPTORS

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), one of best known 
neu ro transmitters, modulates neural activities and a wide range of 
neuro psychological processes [1]. The first step in 5-HT synthesis 
is the catalysis of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) 
by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH); this is the rate-limiting step in 
5-HT synthesis. Two TPH enzymes are known; TPH1 is found 
in several tissues, while TPH2 is a brain-specific enzyme. The 
en zyme 5-HTP decarboxylase next converts 5-HTP to 5-HT 
[2]. In the brain, 5-HT is taken and stored from cytoplasm to sy-
nap tic vesicles by vesicular monoamine transporters. 5-HT is 
relea sed into the synapse through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, 
and its reuptake from the synapse is induced by the serotonin

trans porter (SERT). SERT is the principal site of action of many 
antidepressants (mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 
SSRI; serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, SNRI; tri-
cy clic antidepressants, TCA) and represents a primary target of 
in terest in antidepressant pharmacogenetics. Interestingly, alte ra-
tion of tryptophan metabolism elicited by proinflammatory cy-
to kines has recently gained attention as a new concept to explain 
the etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of major de-
pression [3-5].
5-HT plays an important role in the regulation of many pivo tal 
functions, including emotion, mood, cognition, sleep, cir ca di an 
rh ythm, motor function, reproductive behaviors, thermo regu la-
tion, and endocrine functions, as well as in pathological states such 
as depression, anxiety, Alzheimer’s diseases, schizophrenia, drug 
addic tion, autism, and obesity [6-8]. Therefore, the components 
of the 5-HT system have developed as important therapeutic tar-
gets in the clinic. 5-HT mediates its diverse physiological res pon-
ses through its receptors. Based on structural, biochemical, and 
pharmacological differences, 5-HT receptors (5-HTR) are classi-

fied into 7 distinct receptor families: 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 
5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. The complexity of the 5-HT 
sys tem is further increased by alternative splicing and mRNA edi-
ting of several 5-HT receptors [9, 10]. With the exception of the 
5-HT3 receptors (consists of the 5-HT3A, 5-HT3B, 5-HT3C, 5-HT3D 
and 5-HT3E receptors), which are ligand-gated ion channels, all 
5-HT receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), trans-
mi tting their signals via G-proteins (Table 1) [11].
As a brief introduction to each 5-HT receptor (5-HTR), the 5-HT1R 
and 5-HT5R are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase via Gi/o pro-
teins, and they induce inhibition of cAMP formation. The 5-HT1R 
family comprises the subtypes 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, 
and 5-HT1F receptors, which are known to play roles in the brain 
as well as the heart and gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT5R family 
con sists of 2 subtypes: the 5-HT5A and 5-HT5B. Although the 
5-HT5AR has been found on neurons and neuronal-like cells of the 
ca ro tid body, both receptors are limited in distribution to the CNS 
[12]. However, the 5-HT5R family has not been extensively charac-
teri zed pharmacologically. The 5-HT2R couples to Gq/11 proteins 
and activates phospholipase C leading to the production of ino si-
tol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, intracellular Ca2+ release, and protein ki-
nase C activation. The 5-HT2R family currently comprises 3 recep-
tor subtypes, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C, and has important roles 
in the brain, heart, gastrointestinal tract, platelets, and smooth 
mu scle [11, 13-15]. The 5-HT3R family members are non-selective 
ca tion ligand-gated ion channels. Their effects are excitatory, and 
they exist mainly in the peripheral nervous system, particularly 

on nociceptive afferent neurons and on autonomic and enteric 
neu rons. 5-HT3R antagonists (e.g. ondansetron and tropisetron) 
are used predominantly as anti-emetic drugs [16]. The 5-HT4R, 
5-HT6R, and 5-HT7R are positively coupled to adenylate cyclase 
via GS proteins and they elevate cAMP formation. The 5-HT4R 
con si sts of multiple subtypes (5-HT4A, 5-HT4B, 5-HT4C, 5-HT4D, 
5-HT4E, 5-HT4F, 5-HT4G, 5-HT4H, and 5-HT4HB receptors), and 
the 5-HT7R consists of 4 subtypes (5-HT7A, 5-HT7B, 5-HT7C, and 
5-HT7D receptors) [9, 17]. The 5-HT4R and 5-HT7R play roles in 
the CNS as well as other systems. The 5-HT6R is known to have 
im por tant functions specifically in the CNS due to its exclusive 
dis tri bution in the CNS [6, 11, 18].

DISCOVERY, GENETICS, AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE 5-HT6R

The 5-HT6R is one of the most recently discovered 5-HT re cep-
tors. The history of 5-HT6R was started with the finding of a no vel 
5-HT receptor in the brain since a 5-HT-stimulated ade ny late 
cy clase activity was detected in the striatum which did not fit with 
any of the known classes of 5-HT receptors. Further more, some 
neu  ro blastoma cells (NCB-20 and N18TG2) showed 5-HT-sti-
mu la ted cAMP production that was sensitive to anti psy cho tics in 
a manner suggestive of a novel receptor [19, 20]. The rat 5-HT6R 
was identified and sequenced by 2 groups in 1993 [21, 22], and 
in 1996, the human gene was cloned and shown to have 89% se-
quen ce homology with its rat equivalent [23]. The re com bi nant 
hu man 5-HT6R is positively coupled to adenylate cy clase and has

pharmacological properties similar to the rat re cep tor, exhibiting 
high affinity for several typical and atypical anti psy cho tics, inclu-
ding clozapine. The 5-HT6R protein is a glyco pro tein com prising 
440 amino acids in humans and mice, and 438 amino acids in rats. 
All known 5-HT6R homologues have 7 trans memb rane domains 
that form 3 intracellular and 3 extra cellular loops [24].
The gene for the human 5-HT6R maps to the chromosome re-
gion 1p35-p36 and has an open reading frame of 1,320 bp [23]. 
The gene has 3 exons, which are separated by a 1.8-kb intron at 
po si tion 714 and a second intron of 193 bp at position 873, corres-
pon ding to intracellular loop 3 and extracellular loop 3. In contrast 
to the complexity of the 5-HT receptor isoforms generated by 
al ter native splicing and mRNA editing, as shown in Table 1, the 
5-HT6R has no known isoforms. A non-functional truncated 
splice variant of the 5-HT6R has been identified, but it appears to 
have no physiological significance.
Within the 5-HT6R gene, there is a silent polymorphism at bp po-
si tion 267 within a tyrosine codon, where a cytidine is substituted 
for a thymidine (C267T variant). Based on a number of genetic 
lin ka ge studies, the distribution of C and T alleles appears to be 
more or less equal among the general population. Although this 
poly morphism does not affect the identity of the tyrosine codon, 
it has been further analyzed for biased distribution in several 
hu man diseases. In this regard, several studies have investigated 
whe ther 5-HT6 polymorphisms are associated with brain-related 
varia bles, such as neuropsychiatric disorders. Because several 
anti psychotic agents (notably clozapine) and antidepressants 
have high affinity for and are antagonists of 5-HT6Rs, several ge-
ne tic studies have examined the possible association of 5-HT6 
poly morphisms with schizophrenia and depression [25]. No 
asso ciation of the C267T polymorphism with schizophrenic was 
found in studies of Japanese and French patients. In addition, 
when pharmacogenetic studies were undertaken to assess the 
association between the C267T polymorphism and the response 
of schizophrenic patients to atypical antipsychotic drugs, no 
significant association was observed for patients taking clozapine. 
However, risperidone caused greater improvement in positive 
symptoms in patients carrying a thymidine substitution at the 267 
position [26]. The association of the C267T polymorphism with 
patients suffering from depression has also been investigated, but 
failed to show a significant correlation [27]. A subsequent study 
reported that patients with major depressive disorder carrying the 
C267T polymorphism showed a better response to antidepressant 
medications [28]. Several additional genetic studies have been 
performed to investigate the association of this polymorphism 
and other 5-HT6R polymorphisms on with bipolar disorder, 
Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. However, the results

of these studies have not been reproducible and their significance 
remains to be established [25].
The 5-HT6R is expressed earlier in brain development than 
other 5-HT receptors. High levels of 5-HT6R are first expressed 
on embryonic day 12 (E12) in the rat brain, expression decreases 
slightly on E17, and then remains stable through to adulthood. 
This expression pattern coincides with the emergence of 
serotonergic neuron, implying a role for 5-HT6Rs early in the 
neuronal growth process involving the serotonergic system 
[29]. Rat and human 5-HT6R mRNA is detected in the striatum, 
amygdala, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, cortex and olfactory 
tubercle, but has not been found in peripheral organs. Using 
the highly specific radiolabelled 5-HT6R antagonist [125I] SB-
258585, autoradiographic binding studies in the rat brain show 
high receptor levels in caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, 
striatum, and olfactory tubercles, and choroid plexus. Moderate 
recptor levels are seen in the hippocampus, thalamus, cerebral 
cortex, and frontal and parietal cortex [24, 30]. Similarly, 
immunohistochemical staining shows high receptor levels 
in nucleus accumbens, striatum, olfactory tubercles, cortex, 
hippocampus, and hypothalamus [31, 32]. In in situ hybridization 
and RT-PCR analyses [22, 31], 5-HT6R levels exhibit a similar 
pattern in rats and humans. However, relatively little 5-HT6R 
expression has been demonstrated in the mouse, and it is not 
clear why the mouse 5-HT6R homolog does not exhibit the 
widespread brain expression seen in rats and humans. Indeed, 
many 5-HT6R antagonists that induce enhanced cognition in 
rats have very little effect in mice, which may be due to the low 
expression in mice or to differences in ligand affinity across species 
[33]. Immunohistochemical staining for the 5-HT6Rs has revealed 
that on neurons it is localized on dendrites, cell bodies, and 
postsynaptic sites, and is expressed in GABAergic, cholinergic, and 
glutamatergic neurons [24, 32].

5-HT6R AGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS

Although there are several well-known non-selective 5-HT 
ligands that bind strongly to 5-HT6Rs, such as lysergic acid 
diethylamide (LSD), for many years there were no selective 
5-HT6R agonists or antagonists available. Since the discovery of 
the human 5-HT6R by Kohen et al. [23], an increasing number 
and diversity of selective and novel 5-HT6R ligands have been 
developed using 5-HT6R-specific high-throughput screening 
technologies [34, 35]. The synthesis of 5-HT6R ligands, especially 
5-HT6R antagonists, has been very successful, with a number of 
highly potent ligands being reported. 
Although a variety of highly selective 5-HT6R ligands has been

reported, the major efforts have focused on antagonism because 
of the positive effects of 5-HT6R antagonists in several animal 
models, as discussed below. Before the discovery of such 5-HT6R 
antagonists, 5-HT6Rs were known to have high affinity for various 
atypical antipsychotic drugs and tricyclic antidepressants, but 
they displayed no clear selectivity [36]. Currently, more than 20 
selective 5-HT6R antagonists have been discovered. The most 
potent and selective 5-HT6R antagonists are Ro 04-6790 (displays 
100-fold selectivity for 5-HT6R over other 5-HT receptors), Ro 
63-0563 (100-fold selectivity), SB-271046 (50-fold selectivity), SB-
258585 (100-fold selectivity), and SB-399885 (200-fold selectivity) 
[37-39]. Although Ro04-6790 and SB-271046 were the first 
identified and the most studied 5-HT6R antagonists, respectively, 
they have limited capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier and 
appear to be orally active [37, 39]. Other 5-HT6R antagonists such 
as SB-699929, SB-357134, and SB-399885 appear to have better 
pharmacokinetical and pharmacological profiles than SB-271046 
and SB-258585 [40]. AVN-322, BVT-74316, PRX-07034, R-1485, 
SYN-114, SYN-120, and SUVN-502 are additional 5-HT6R 
antagonists that are being developed for the treatment of cognitive 
disorders and are currently in phase I clinical trials [41]. Several 
5-HT6R antagonists including AVN-211, SAM-531, SB-742457, 
and SGS-518 have reached phase II clinical trials for cognitive 
disorders [41]. [11C]-GSK215083 is a radiolabeled 5-HT6R 
antagonist being developed as a PET radiotracer for the 5-HT6R, 
and is in phase I trials [42].
Compared to the 5-HT6R antagonists, considerably fewer 
compounds claim to be selective 5-HT6R agonists. Examples 
are 2-ethyl-5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (EMDT), 
EMD386088, WAY-466, E-6801, LY586713, WAY-208466, WAY-
181187, and R-13c [40]. EMD386088 displays 20-fold selectivity 
for the 5-HT6R over other 5-HT-binding receptors, including 
the 5-HT transporter protein and dopamine receptors [43]. 
R13-c displays 50-fold selectivity over other 5-HT and dopamine 
receptors [44]. E-6801and E-6837 are potent partial agonists of 
the 5-HT6R [45]. Thus, there are few 5-HT6R agonists, and only 
WAY-181187 (displays 50-fold selectivity against serotonergic and 
other receptors) has been characterized and widely used [46, 47]. 
Recently, a new 5-HT6R agonist, ST1936, has been reported and 
compared with the characteristics of WAY-181187 [48]. 

THE ROLES OF THE 5-HT6R IN THE CNS

Taken together, the high affinity of the 5-HT6R for atypical 
antipsychotic drugs and tricyclic antidepressants, and its abundant 
distribution in the brain (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and 
hypothalamus) imply that the 5-HT6R plays important roles 

in the CNS and in the etiology of neurological diseases. The 
5-HT6R shares a signaling mechanism with 5-HT4R and 5-HT7R 
in that they are the three 5-HT receptors positively coupled to 
Gs proteins, inducing cAMP production through stimulation of 
adenylate cyclase activity. However, since the 5-HT6R is almost 
exclusively expressed in the brain compared with the expression 
patterns of the 5-HT4R and 5-HT7R, recently developed selective 
5-HT6R ligands may represent attractive new therapeutic options 
for several types of diseases.

Depression 
Many of the current treatments for depression act by increasing 
serotonergic neurotransmission with selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), and data from SSRIs form the basis for the mo-
noamine hypothesis of affective disorders [3]. However, a causative 
role of perturbed 5-HT function in depression has been difficult 
to prove, and the specific serotonergic receptors responsible for 
antidepressant efficacy are poorly defined. Preclinical data suggests 
a possible role for 5-HT6Rs in depression; however, the results of 
pharmacological studies are equivocal since both blockade and 
stimulation of 5-HT6Rs may evoke antidepressant-like effects.
Research in mice and rats has shown that 5-HT6R agonists 
produce antidepressant effects in a number of tests. As mentioned 
above, the first 5-HT6R agonists (LY-586713 and WAY-466) have 
been identified and are being evaluated as potential treatments 
for depression. Antidepressants such as the SSRIs upregulate 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression [49], 
and the 5-HT6R is a candidate for mediating these changes. The 
selective 5-HT6R agonist, LY-586713, upregulates BDNF mRNA 
in the hippocampus and cortex. This effect was observed at 1 
mg/kg LY-586713 and was completely blocked by pre-treatment 
with the selective 5-HT6R antagonist SB-271046 (10 mg/kg) 
[50]. The 5-HT6R agonist EMDT reduced immobility in tail 
suspension tests in mice, whereas the 5-HT6R antagonist SB-
271046 prevented the antidepressant effects of EMDT and that 
of the antidepressant fluoxetine [51]. It was also recently shown 
that the selective 5-HT6R agonists WAY-181187 and WAY-208466 
have antidepressant-like effects in established behavioral tests 
such as the forced swim test in rats [52]. These findings suggest 
that 5-HT6R agonists may represent a new class of antidepressant 
compounds that possess a number of advantages over currently 
available treatments. Paradoxically, selective 5-HT6R antagonists 
have also been reported to produce antidepressant-like effects. 
Using the forced swim and tail suspension tests, the 5-HT6R 
antagonist SB-399885 produced anti-depressant-like effects in 
both rats and mice [53]. SB-399885 also augmented the anti-
immobility effects of antidepressants in the forced swim test [54].

However, the same authors recently reported that the 5-HT6R 
agonist EMD386088 produces antidepressant effects in rats 
after intrahippocampal administration [55]. This effect was fully 
blocked by the selective 5-HT6R antagonist SB-399885 when 
administered at a dose that had been reported as inactive in their 
previous studies [53, 54]. 
Thus, both 5-HT6R agonists and antagonists show antidepre-
ssant-like effects in preclinical studies, although the reason for 
their analogous effects is currently unclear. One likely explanation 
for the paradoxical effects of 5-HT6R agonists and antagonists 
is that their similar behavioral effects are mediated through di-
ffe rent neurochemical mechanisms. The antidepressant-like 
effects of 5-HT6R antagonists could be produced through non-
serotonergic mechanisms while the activation of 5-HT6Rs would 
likely produce behavioral effects similar to those of SSRIs through 
global stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. Supporting 
this explanation, microdialysis studies suggest that the 5-HT6R 
antagonist SB-271046 increases dopamine and nora d renaline 
concentrations in rat medial prefrontal cortex [56]. The in volve-
ment of these neurotransmitters in the anti-immo bility action of 
5-HT6R antagonist has been supported by a study demonstrating 
that a selective 5-HT6R antagonist enhanced the anti-immobility 
action of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor desipramine and 
the dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion in forced swim tests 
[54]. The antidepressant-like action of a 5-HT6R antagonist has 
also been attributed to its action at dopamine D1 and D2 receptors 
and α2-adrenoceptors [57]. Indeed, the antidepressant-like effects 
of the 5-HT6R antagonist SB-399885 persisted after 5-HT de ple-
tion, suggesting that the effects of this compound were not depen-
dent on endogenous serotonergic neurotransmission [57]. 

Anxiety
There are surprisingly only few studies that have explored 5-HT6R 
activity in anxiety compared with the involvement of other 5-HT 
receptor subtypes. Both 5-HT6R agonists and antagonists show 
anxiolytic-like effects, similar to their actions in depression [58]. 
When the selective 5-HT6R agonist WAY-181187 was admini-
stered acutely, it effectively decreased water intake by rats that 
had not been water-deprived in the schedule-induced polydipsia 
test, a model considered to be predictive for efficacy in obsessive-
compulsive disorder [47]. However, blockade of 5-HT6Rs can 
also produce anxiolytic activity. Wesolowska and Nikiforuk [53] 
have observed that the selective 5-HT6R antagonist SB-399885 
produced specific anxiolytic-like activity in animal models of 
anxiety, such as the conflict drinking (Vogel) and elevated plus 
maze tests in rats and the four-plate test in mice. 
Current therapeutic agents for the treatment of anxiety dis or-

The Serotonin-6 Receptor as a Novel Therapeutic Target

ders include benzodiazepines and SSRIs that act either directly or 
in directly to modulate GABAergic neurotransmission. Benzo dia-
ze pines, which act as positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA 
re ceptor/Cl- ion channel complex, enhance GABA signaling 
following receptor stimulation. SSRIs may enhance levels of GABA 
as predicted from recent imaging studies in humans. Interestingly, 
immunohistochemical studies suggest that the 5-HT6R colocalizes 
with GABAergic neurons. In neurochemical studies, both WAY-
181187 and WAY-466 consistently elevate levels of GABA in many 
regions of the brain regions associated with anxiety, including the 
frontal cortex and amygdala [47]. The ability of 5-HT6R agonists 
to enhance extracellular GABA levels and decrease stimulated 
glutamatergic neurotransmission seems to support the hypothesis 
that 5-HT6R agonists may be effective agents for the treatment 
of anxiety. Unfortunately, there are no neurochemical studies 
on the effect of SB-399885 on GABA release. Therefore, further 
studies are necessary to explain the anxiolytic-effects of 5-HT6R 
antagonists and to demonstrate the effect of 5-HT6R agonists and 
antagonists in various animal models of anxiety.

Cognitive dysfunction associated with Alzheimer’s disease
Significant reductions in 5-HT6R density have been found in 
cor ti cal areas of the brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients, al thou-
gh the reductions were unrelated to the cognitive status before 
dea th. As 5-HT6R blockade induces acetylcholine release, the 
observed reductions in 5-HT6R density may represent an effort 
to restore acetylcholine levels in a deteriorated cholinergic system 
[25]. Based on these findings, there has been increasing interest 
in the role of the 5-HT6R in higher cognitive processes such as 
memory. An increasing number of recent studies support the use 
of 5-HT6R antagonism as a promising mechanism for treating 
cognitive dysfunction. Most studies, in healthy adult rats, report 
that 5-HT6R antagonists enhance retention of spatial learning in 
the Morris water maze, improve consolidation in autoshaping 
tasks, and reverse natural forgetting in object recognition. 5-HT6R 
antagonists appear to facilitate both cholinergic and glutamatergic 
neurotransmission, reversing scopolamine-induced and NMDA 
receptor antagonist-induced memory impairments. Thus, there is 
current interest in the role of 5-HT6Rs in cognitive enhancement 
as a therapeutic approach in Alzheimer’s diseases [59, 60]. Based 
on the preclinical data demonstrating their beneficial effect 
on cognition [41, 61], a number of 5-HT6R antagonists have 
undergone successful phase I clinical studies, and some have 
been evaluated in phase II clinical studies for the treatment of 
Alzheimer’s disease. PRX-07034 and SB-742457 are the 5-HT6R 
antagonists currently in phase I and II studies, respectively [62]. 
Other phase II trials are being performed with SB-742457, SGS-

518, or SAM-531, either alone or as add-on therapy with the 
acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, donepezil [41]. 
Compared with 5-HT6R antagonists, there have been few studies 
on the role of 5-HT6R agonists in cognition. In a recent study, 
selective 5-HT6R agonists and antagonists were administered 
either alone, after a scopolamine-induced impairment, or 
combined with sub-effective doses of the acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitor, donepezil, or the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist, 
memantine, in a novel object discrimination paradigm in adult 
rats [63]. The authors reported that the 5-HT6R agonist E-6801 
produced significant and dose-dependent increases in novel object 
exploration, indicative of memory enhancement. More intriguing 
were the results obtained when combining non-active doses of the 
5-HT6R agonist E-6801 and the 5-HT6R antagonist SB-271046, 
which produced an improvement in novel object discrimination. 
However, more behavioral experiments using diverse and selective 
5-HT6R agonists are required to elucidate the role of 5-HT6R 
agonists in cognition.

NEUROCHEMICAL MECHANISMS OF 5-HT6RS

As a member of the Gs-GPCR family, it is well known that enga-

ge  ment of the 5-HT6R activates cAMP signaling path ways through 
adenylate cyclase stimulation. In addition, Svenningsson et al. [64] 
reported that the activation of 5-HT6Rs increases phosphorylation 
of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of molecular 
weight 32,000 (DARPP-32) by protein kinase A. However, there 
are still insufficient studies on the mechanisms of 5-HT6R-
mediated signal transductions to understand the receptor’s various 
roles in physiological and pathological states in the CNS, including 
Alzheimer’s disease, depression, cognition, and obesity. This is 
mainly due to the lack of pharmacological tools able to selectively 
activate 5-HT6Rs in the CNS. The selective 5-HT6R agonists have 
only recently been developed and characterized [47, 48, 65]. This 
lack of appropriate tools has also contributed to the inconsistent 
observations on the pharmacological and neurochemical effects of 
5-HT6R antagonists.
To identify the mechanism of 5-HT6R function and its cellular 
me cha nisms in the CNS, we employed a yeast two-hybrid scree-
ning system on a human brain cDNA library, with the 5-HT6R 
intracellular loop 2 (iL2), intracellular loop 3 (iL3), and the car-
boxyl terminus as bait (Fig. 1). We first reported that Fyn, a mem-
ber of the Src family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, is 
bound to the carboxyl terminus of the 5-HT6R [32]. The expre-

Fig. 1. 5-HT6R-mediated signal transduction pathways. The activation of 5-HT6R increases DARPP-32 activities by PKA [64] and ERK1/2 activities 
via Fyn- and PKA-dependent pathways [32]. Fyn also leads to the surface expression of 5-HT6R via a direct interaction be tween Fyn and the carboxyl terminus 
of 5-HT6Rs [32]. In addition, a novel interaction between human HT6R (iL3 and the carboxyl ter mi nus) and Jab1 was demonstrated by Yun et al. [68]. The 
expression of Jab1 mediates the modulation of the membrane expression and activity of 5-HT6Rs. 5-HT6Rs also affect the cytosol/nuclear distribution of Jab1 as 
well as the interaction between Jab1 and c-Jun, a target protein downstream of Jab1.

ssion of Fyn increases 5-HT6R activity by increasing receptor 
surface expression without changing total cellular expression 
of 5-HT6R protein. Reciprocally, the activation of 5-HT6Rs also 
increases Fyn phosphorylation at Tyr-420. Phosphorylation at Tyr-
420 was blocked when the 5-HT6R-Fyn interaction was blocked 
by overexpression of the Fyn SH3 domain, the best-characterized 
do main for Fyn-mediated protein-protein interactions. We fur-
ther demonstrated that the activation of 5-HT6Rs activated extra-
cellular signal regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) activity through Fyn- 
and PKA-dependent pathway. We recently showed that 2 selective 
5-HT6R agonists, ST1936 and WAY-181187, also increased Fyn 
phosphorylation [48]. Because Fyn is known to be involved in 
Alzheimer’s disease through modulation of the microtubule-asso-
cia ted tau and amyloid-β proteins [66, 67], our observations may 
provide a cellular mechanism for 5-HT6R-mediated cognition and 
mood changes in the brain. It is also interesting to note that the 
5-HT6R agonist, LY-586713, increases expression of cortical and 
hippocampal BDNF which could mediate its pro-cognitive effect; 
however, the cortical increase in BDNF was not antagonized by 
SB-271046 [50], suggesting the increased BDNF expression is 
mediated through a different mechanism. 
Our group has also characterized a second 5-HT6R-interacting 
pro tein:  Jun  activation  domain-binding  protein-1  (Jab1,  Fig.  1). 
We re cen tly discovered a novel interaction between human 5-HT6R and 
Jab1, and we observed Jab1-mediated modulation of the mem brane 
expression and activity of 5-HT6Rs [68]. In addition, we found 
that 5-HT6Rs affect the cytosolic and nuclear distribution of Jab1 
as well as the interaction between Jab1 and c-Jun, a target protein 
downstream of Jab1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 5-HT6Rs 
and Jab1 play important roles under conditions of in vitro hypoxia 
and in vivo cerebral ischemia. A recent study has suggested that 
Jab1 is involved in the onset of neuronal diseases such as Alz-
hei mer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease through interaction 
with the endoplasmic reticulum stress transducer IRE1 [69]. 
There fore, these data provide new insights into the physiological 
roles of 5-HT6Rs and Jab1 in the CNS at both the molecular and 
cellular levels. In addition to Fyn and Jab1 binding proteins, we 
are currently investigating 2 other proteins as candidate 5-HT6R-
binding proteins.
To explore the neurochemical mechanisms involved in 5-HT6R 
functions, several microdialysis studies have been performed using 
selective 5-HT6R ligands. In studies using in vivo microdialysis, 
increased acetylcholine levels were observed in the rat medial pre-
frontal cortex after acute administration of the 5-HT6R antagonist 
SB-399885 [70] but not in the hippocampus after administration 
of another antagonist, Ro04-6790 [71]. Another selective 5-HT6R 
antagonist, SB-357134, has been reported to increase high KCl-

stimulated acetylcholine release in vitro in rat cortical and stria-
tal slices [72]. However, no in vitro or in vivo microdialysis 
stu dies have yet been reported on acetylcholine release using 
selec tive 5-HT6R agonists. Glutamate is a major excitatory neuro-
transmitter in the CNS. 5-HT6R antagonists have been shown 
to in crease the extracellular concentration of glutamate both 
in vivo by SB-271046 in the frontal cortex and hippocampus 
[73], and in vitro by SB-357134 in the cortex and striatum [72]. 
Interestingly, it was reported that the selective 5-HT6R agonist 
WAY-181187 attenuated the stimulated glutamate levels elicited by 
sodium azide and high KCl in vitro but not in vivo [47]. A recent 
electrophysiological study using whole-cell patch-clamp recording 
showed that 5-HT6R activation by ST1936 inhibits corticostriatal 
glutamatergic transmission, which was mimicked by a different 
agonist, WAY-181187 [65]. This finding is consistent with the 
reported in vitro microdialysis data using WAY-181187 [47].
Woolley et al. [24] reported on the immunohistochemical co-
localization of 5-HT6R with GABAergic neurons in many areas of 
the cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. 
These co-localization data together with the microdialysis 
data suggest that 5-HT6R agonists/antagonists may modulate 
cholinergic and/or glutamatergic systems via disinhibition of 
GABAergic neurons. If 5-HT6Rs do modulate cholinergic and/or 
glutamatergic systems in this manner, then 5-HT6R antagonists 
should decrease GABA release. In fact, no study has yet reported 
on the modulation of GABA release by 5-HT6R antagonists using 
microdialysis or electrophysiological methods. On the other hand, 
the 5-HT6R agonist WAY-181187 has been shown to significantly 
increase extracellular GABA concentrations in the hippocampus, 
striatum, and amygdala, but had no effect on GABA levels in the 
nucleus accumbens or thalamus [47]. Another 5-HT6R agonist, 
WAY-208466, also preferentially elevated cortical GABA levels 
following acute and chronic administration, indicating that 
neurochemical tolerance does not develop following repeated 
5-HT6R stimulation. These in vivo data were also confirmed by in 
vitro electrophysiological investigations. WAY-181187 increased 
the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents 
(sIPSC) recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons [74]. This 
effect was blocked by the 5-HT6R antagonist SB-399885, which 
confirmed it to be mediated by activation of 5-HT6Rs. Collectively, 
the results of these microdialysis and electrophysiological 
experiments suggest that 5-HT6R agonists/antagonists may 
modulate cholinergic, glutamatergic, and/or GABAergic systems.

PERSPECTIVES

The 5-HT6R has gained increasing attention over the past decade,

and has become a promising target for the treatment of CNS 
diseases. Currently, consistent effects have been demonstrated 
with 5-HT6R antagonists in preclinical models of cognition and 
5-HT6Rs have obvious pharmaceutical potential. Although the 
majority of 5-HT6R research has focused on their pro-cognitive 
effects, the role of these receptors in depression and anxiety 
has also been postulated. However, the preclinical results are 
equivocal since blockade and stimulation of 5-HT6Rs may evoke 
pro-cognitive, antidepressant-like, or anti-anxiety-like effects. 
The explanation for these paradoxical effects remains unclear. 
The function of the 5-HT6R has been revealed to be much more 
complex than initially defined. Based on the existing data, and 
depending on the drug used, different cellular pathways may be 
activated. However, the full characterization of the functional 
profile of 5-HT6Rs is still pending. The drug discovery process 
may benefit considerably from this complexity, in terms of the 
quantity and quality of potential new therapeutic molecules. Thus, 
the functions of 5-HT6Rs must be studies at both molecular and 
cellular levels in order to understand their roles in the CNS and to 
develop novel drug targets for neurological diseases.
