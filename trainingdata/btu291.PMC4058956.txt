Usually, their results are incomplete and fragmented into hundreds of contigs.
Repeats in genomes and sequencing errors are the main reasons for these complications.
With the rapidly growing number of sequenced genomes, it is now feasible to improve assemblies by guiding them with genomes from related species.
Results: Here we introduce AlignGraph, an algorithm for extending and joining de novo-assembled contigs or scaffolds guided by closely related reference genomes.
It aligns paired-end (PE) reads and pre- assembled contigs or scaffolds to a close reference.
From the ob- tained alignments, it builds a novel data structure, called the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph.
The incorporated positional informa- tion from the alignments and PE reads allows us to extend the initial assemblies, while avoiding incorrect extensions and early termin- ations.
In our performance tests, AlignGraph was able to substantially improve the contigs and scaffolds from several assemblers.
For in- stance, 28.7 62.3% of the contigs of Arabidopsis thaliana and human could be extended, resulting in improvements of common assembly metrics, such as an increase of the N50 of the extendable contigs by 89.9 94.5% and 80.3 165.8%, test, AlignGraph was able to improve the assembly of a published genome (Arabidopsis strain Landsberg) by increasing the N50 of its extendable scaffolds by 86.6%.
These results demonstrate AlignGraph s efficiency in improving genome assemblies by taking advantage of closely related references.

In another  1 INTRODUCTION  Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence new genomes at a fraction of the time and cost required only a few years ago.
These improvements now allow experimental scientists to integrate genome sequen- cing approaches into their daily research.
In the absence of a close reference genome, whole-genome shotgun NGS sequencing is the most common approach where a de novo assembly algo- rithm is used to join reads into longer continuous contigs and scaffolds.
Most NGS de novo assemblers create a string or de Bruijn graph representing the connections among the reads and output the paths in the graph as assembled contigs.
Examples of these algorithms include Edena (Hernandez et al., 2008), Velvet  *To whom correspondence should be addressed.
differs  from alignment-based  (Zerbino and Birney, 2008), ABySS (Simpson et al., 2009), ALLPATHS-LG (Gnerre et al., 2011), SOAPdenovo (Li et al., 2010  Luo et al., 2012), MaSuRCA (Zimin et al., 2013), CABOG (Miller et al., 2008), Euler-USR (Chaisson et al., 2009) and IDBA (Peng et al., 2010).
This de novo assembly approach fun- resequencing damentally approaches, where the NGS reads are not assembled but aligned against a similar reference genome using a variant tolerant short read aligner and structural variant detection algorithms (Ossowski et al., 2008  Zeitouni et al., 2010).
Large parts of the sequence of the target genome can then be reconstructed from the mismatches, indels and rearrangements observed in the align- ment results.
De novo assemblies tend to be computationally more challenging than alignment-based approaches.
Additional limitations include (i) the assembly results are often fragmented into large numbers of contigs, (ii) the genome covered by the assembled contigs/scaffolds is commonly incomplete and (iii) the frequency of falsely assembled contigs can be high because of chimeric joins.
The most important reasons for these compli- cations are usually sequencing errors, repeat sequences in the target genome, non-uniform sequencing depth and limited read length of NGS data.
These error sources result in false-positive, incomplete and branched paths in the assembly graph, and thus greatly limit the lengths and completeness of the final contigs (Chaisson and Pevzner, 2008  Peng et al., 2010  Zerbino and Birney, 2008).
Combining both de novo assembly and align- ment-based approaches presents a powerful alternative when a closely related reference genome sequence is available, but its genetic differences relative to the target genome are too pro- nounced to resolve them with an alignment approach alone (Phillippy et al., 2008  Schatz et al., 2013  Schneeberger et al., 2011).
In this case, one can first assemble the reads into contigs and then align them together with the reads to the reference.
The much longer contigs facilitate the identification of complex re- arrangements, whereas the read alignments are useful for detect- ing smaller variations in regions that are not covered by contigs.
Because of the rapidly increasing number of reference genomes becoming available for most organism groups, this reference- assisted assembly approach will soon become the default option for many genome sequencing projects.
Compared with de novo assemblies, reference-assisted assemblies have many advantages.
First, the alignments of the contigs and reads against the close reference provide valuable proximity information that can be used to extend contigs with additional reads and to join contigs even if they overlap only by a few nucleotides.
Second, the prox- imity information in the alignment can also be used to orient and order contigs along the reference to build a scaffold map of the entire assembly.
Third, the alignment map can be used to evalu- ate the quality of contigs and pinpoint potential misassemblies.

largely based on existing assembly software  Previous studies on reference-assisted assemblies include the AMOScmp software (Pop et al., 2004a), an add-on tool for the ARACHNE assembler (Gnerre et al., 2009) and custom work- flows (e.g.
Schneeberger et al., 2011).
The first two were designed primarily for Sanger reads, whereas the latter has been used for NGS genome assembly.
Downstream of the primary assembly, scaf- folding algorithms, such as RACA (Kim et al., 2013), can be used to order and orient preassembled contigs to a connection map by incorporating additional sequence information from mate pair or PE reads and/or from closely related genomes (Boetzer et al., 2011  Dayarian et al., 2010  Gao et al., 2011  Gritsenko et al., 2012  Pop et al., 2004b  Salmela et al., 2011).
The resulting scaffolds often contain gaps, which are unresolved sequence areas between the original contigs.
Dedicated gap- filling algorithms can be used to partially fill these gaps (Boetzer and Pirovano, 2012  Luo et al., 2012  Tsai et al., 2010).
More recently, components of reference-based strategies have also been incorporated into some of the de novo assembly suites themselves such as the cheat mode option of ALLPATHS- LG (Gnerre et al., 2011) and IDBA-hybrid (unpublished).
This study proposes a novel algorithm, called AlignGraph, for improving the lengths and completeness of contigs or scaffolds by reassembling them with help provided by a reference genome of a closely related organism.
In contrast to existing reference- assisted methods, AlignGraph is a secondary assembly algorithm that loads the alignment information of PE reads and pre- assembled contigs/scaffolds against the reference into a novel assembly graph, called the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph, that we specifically designed for facilitating secondary assem- blies.
By traversing this graph, the contigs or scaffolds of the primary assembly can be extended and joined.
AlignGraph dif- fers from most scaffolding algorithms by extending contigs ex- clusively with resolved rather than unresolved bases (Ns) and by acting either upstream and/or downstream of them.
AlignGraph s functionalities are unique by solving several challenges in improving assembly results.
As a de Bruijn graph-based method, it solves limitations typical for many heur- istic extension methods that are often used in the de novo assem- bly area (Dohm et al., 2007  Jeck et al., 2007  Warren et al., 2007).
For instance, if there are multiple solutions for how to extend a contig, then finding the correct one can be challenging with most heuristic methods.
Those ambiguous solutions, which correspond to branched paths in the de Bruijn graph, are usually caused by repetitive sequences in genomes and frequently lead to early terminations of the contig extension process.
The de Bruijn graph method is often more efficient than heuristic methods in finding the correct solution here because the contextual informa- tion, required for resolving these ambiguities, is maintained in the graph (Chaisson and Pevzner, 2008  Zerbino and Birney, 2008).
This issue is not as pronounced in assemblies with much longer Sanger reads, as those are more likely to span non-repeti- tive regions with repetitive regions in between (Gnerre et al., 2009).
Thus, it is particularly important to address this problem in assemblies with short reads.
In comparison with the conven- tional de Bruijn graph, our PE multipositional de Bruijn graph has several additional advantages.
First, many branched paths can be eliminated directly in the graph with the help of the add- itional PE read and alignment information.
This simplifies the  i320  identification of correct paths.
Second, many false-positive paths, caused by sequencing errors, can be eliminated by correcting erroneous reads with correct reads that align to the same position in the reference genome.
Third, guided by the alignment infor- mation to the reference genome, the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph is less affected by regionally low read coverage that often gives rise to incomplete paths in the conventional de Bruijn graph.
As a result, many incorrect extensions and early termin- ations can be avoided.
2 METHODS  2.1 AlignGraph algorithm This section describes the AlignGraph algorithm.
Its workflow can be divided into the following three major steps.
Figure 1B illustrates these steps with an example.
(i) Alignment maps.
The PE reads are aligned against both the pre- assembled contigs and the close reference genome  the contigs are aligned against the reference.
(ii) Contig reassembly.
The alignment mapping results are used to construct a positional variant of the de Bruijn graph, called the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph.
(iii) Graph traversal.
The resulting graph is edited and traversed to  obtain extended contigs.
Throughout the text, the source genome of the PE reads and the pre- assembled contigs is referred to as the target genome, whereas the genome of the closely related species for guiding the contig improvement steps is referred to as the reference genome.
For simplicity, the following descrip- tion of AlignGraph refers mostly to contigs, but it also applies to scaf- folds containing a limited amount gaps.
Prerequisites Before the above steps, the user is expected to generate genomic PE reads for the target genome of interest and to assemble them with a de novo NGS genome assembler.
Because most genome assemblers perform better with PE than single-end data, AlignGraph also depends on this sequence type.
A major advantage of AlignGraph is its design to work with most genome assemblers, but the quality of the initial de novo assembled contigs is expected to impact the final results (see Section 3.2).
For optimal results, it is also important to follow the recommendations of the chosen de novo assembler with respect to insert length of the sequen- cing library, minimum coverage of the target genome with PE reads and other recommendations.
If scaffolds are inputted, it is usually beneficial to fill them with a gap-filling algorithm before processing them with AlignGraph (e.g.
Boetzer and Pirovano, 2012).
Another requirement for AlignGraph is the availability of a closely related reference genome sequence.
Nearly complete reference genomes of high quality will yield the best results, but partially sequenced genomes can be used as well.
(i) Alignment maps In the initial preprocessing step of AlignGraph, the PE reads, used for the de novo assembly in the Prerequisite section, are aligned to the contigs and to the reference genome, and the contigs are also aligned to the reference genome.
Aligning the reads to the contigs simplifies their alignments to the reference by guiding them with the much longer contigs as backbone (see below).
Generating reliable alignments among the PE reads and the contigs is relatively straightforward because both are from the same genetic background, thus requiring a low level of variant tolerance in the alignments.
Aligning the contigs to the reference genome demands a higher level of variant tolerance.
However, because of the relatively large length of the contigs, their alignments to the reference can also be generated reliably, as long as the evolutionary distance be- tween the target and reference genome is not too large.
The current im- plementation of AlignGraph uses Bowtie2 and BLAT for these two   AlignGraph  A  B  Fig.

Overview of the AlignGraph algorithm.
The outline on the top (A) shows AlignGraph in the context of common genome assembly workflows, and the one on the bottom (B) illustrates its three main processing steps.
(A) In Step 1, the PE reads from a target genome are assembled by a de novo assembler into contigs (here c1  c2 and c3).
Subsequently (Step 2), the contigs can be extended (blue) and joined by AlignGraph (e1 and e2).
(B) The workflow of AlignGraph consists of three main steps.
(i) The PE reads are aligned to the reference genome and to the contigs, and the contigs are also aligned to the reference genome.
(ii) The PE multipositional de Bruijn graph is built from the alignment results, where the red and blue subpaths correspond to the aligned contigs and sequences from PE reads, respectively.
(iii) The extended and/or joined contigs (here e1 and e2) are generated by traversing the graph  alignment steps, respectively (Kent, 2002  Langmead and Salzberg, 2012).
In contrast to this, aligning the relatively short PE reads to the reference genome is a more challenging task owing to the difficulty of generating reliable short alignments containing larger numbers of mismatches and gaps.
This problem does not apply to the reads aligning to the contigs because their alignment positions to the reference genome can be inferred from the more robust contig alignments.
For the PE read to reference genome alignment, it is important to choose a highly variant tolerant short read aligner that is able to reliably align most of the short reads to their true source locations in the reference genome while minimizing the number of false-positive read placements.
Clearly, the latter would negatively impact the precision performance of AlignGraph by leading to chimeric joins in the downstream contig extension steps.
Although a wide range of short read aligners has been developed over the past years (Li and Homer, 2010), none of them has been specifically designed or opti- mized for aligning short reads against reference genomes with sequence differences more pronounced than those observed among genomes within the same species.
To minimize the above challenges, we have chosen for this critical step the highly tunable Bowtie2 aligner with parameter set- tings that we optimized for aligning PE reads from a target genome to a reference genome sharing variable degrees of sequence similarity.
The use of PE read alignments in this step is also important because the additional sequence information, provided by the second read in a PE, increases the specificity of the alignment process compared with single-end reads, and thus reduces the number of false read placements.
To account for re- arrangements among the two genomes, we use for the alignments of the PE reads against the reference genome more relaxed insert length variation settings than in the alignments against the contigs.
(ii) Contig reassembly with PE multipositional de Bruijn graph The core functionality of AlignGraph is the extension of the contigs by reassembling them using the alignment results obtained in the previous step.
To achieve this efficiently, we build from the alignment maps a variant of the de Bruijn graph, here called the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph.
This method combines the PE de Bruijn graph (Medvedev et al., 2011) and the positional de Bruijn graph (Ronen et al., 2012), where we incorporate both PE read information and align- ment positions into the graph (Pevzner et al., 2001).
The former was  Table 1.

Our approach solves several problems in improving assembly results that we briefly discussed in Section 1 (see also Table 1).
The following describes our modified de Bruijn graph in more details, where we first introduce im- portant concepts of conventional de Bruijn graph-based assembly methods.
Background The most widely used method for genome assemblies from short reads is the de Bruijn graph method (Pevzner et al., 2001).
A de Bruijn graph is a directed graph: two connected nodes represent k + 1 bases, where the first node represents the first k bases, and the second node the second k bases (called k-mer).
To construct a de Bruijn graph, l   k+1 connected nodes are constructed from each read of length l, and two nodes from different reads are joined if they share the same k-mers.
In theory, the graph contains a walk representing the full sequence of the genome if traversed properly.
However, this walk is hard to obtain in practice because of false-positive, incomplete and branched connections in the graph that are caused by errors in the reads and  i321   E.Bao et al.
repeats in the genome.
The false-positive and incomplete paths are due to false-positive k-mers with sequencing errors and missing k-mers from regions of low sequencing depth, respectively.
The branched paths are caused by joins of k-mers from repetitive regions.
Several variations of the de Bruijn graph have been proposed to solve these limitations, especially the branched paths, while preserving all of its genome information (Medvedev et al., 2011  Peng et al., 2010  Ronen et al., 2012).
The PE de Bruijn graph (Medvedev et al., 2011) is built from PE reads, where each k-mer contains k bases from the left pair plus its corresponding k bases from the right pair.
In contrast to this, the positional de Bruijn graph (Ronen et al., 2012) incorporates read alignment information by including in each k-mer the k bases plus its alignment position.
With the additional information assigned to the k-mers, k-mers from repetitive regions can often be distinguished, and thus the number of branches in the graph can be reduced.
In addition, because the positional de Bruijn graph is built from read alignments, false-positive and incomplete paths can be largely avoided.
We emphasize that the PE de Bruijn graph re- quires the left pair forward-strand read and the right pair reverse-strand read or vice versa, but it is difficult to know their orientation.
This prob- lem can be resolved if the PE de Bruijn graph is built from aligned reads, where their orientation can be obtained from the alignments.
PE multipositional de Bruijn graph We derive the PE multipos- itional de Bruijn graph as a combination of the PE de Bruijn graph and the positional de Bruijn graph.
Each k-mer of the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph is composed of three left/right element pairs: the k bases of each the left and the right read pair (called left or right k bases), the alignment position of each the left and the right k bases to the contigs and the alignment position of each the left and the right k bases to the reference genome.
Two k-mers can be joined if they have similar k bases and close alignment positions within the constraints defined in the for- mulas below.
Formally, let s be the k bases from the left read pair and s0 the corresponding k bases from the right read pair, then the k-mer of PE multipositional de Bruijn graph is a 6 tuple (s  s0  c  g, c0  g0), where c is the alignment position of s to the contigs, g is the alignment position of s to the reference genome, c0 is the alignment position of s0 to the contigs and g0 is the alignment position of s0 to the reference genome.
Two k-mers 0) can be joined if con- (si  si strains (1) (6) are met:  0) and (sj  sj  0  cj  gj  cj  0  ci  gi  ci  0  gi  0  gj  mismatchðsi  sjÞ5  mismatchðsi 0Þ5   0  sj  jci   cjj5  or ci=   1 or cj=   1  jgi   gjj5   jci  0   cj  0j5 +2D or ci  0  =   1 or cj  0  =   1  jgi  0   gj  0j5 +2D  ð1Þ ð2Þ ð3Þ ð4Þ ð5Þ ð6Þ  where   and   are small numbers with the default values 5 and 25, re- spectively, and D is the variability of the insert length I of the PE reads.
The variability D is equal to max fIu   I  I   Ilg, where Iu and Il are the upper and lower limits of I, respectively.
The variables in the above for- mulas are explained below.
: To join two k-mers and tolerate sequencing errors, we allow a 0 small number of mismatches   between si and sj and between si and sj  0 in (1) and (2), respectively.
: We allow a small shift   between each pair of alignment positions 0) from in (3) (6) because the same k bases si and sj (or si different reads may align to different but close positions in the con- tigs or genome, as discussed in Ronen et al.
(2012).
0 and sj  i322  0 and sj  0 s alignment positions to the 2D: We allow a shift 2D of si contigs in (5) and to the reference genome in (6).
The maximum and minimum alignment distances between a read pair are I   l+D and I   l   D, respectively, where l is the read length, assuming the same read length for both members in a pair.
Thus, the maximum alignment distance of two right reads with left reads aligned at the same position is ðI   l+DÞ   ðI   l   DÞ=2D.
This distance is equal to the distance between any two k-mers from the same position in the right read pairs, so the maximum distance between si  0 will be 2D.
0 and sj  0 and sj  0) can be joined if one or both of them are  1: si and sj (or si aligned directly to the reference genome rather than guided by the de novo contigs.
In those cases, we assign  1 as alignment position to the contigs.
This is important because we allow contig extensions only if the alignable and unalignable bases to contigs can be joined.
It is important to guarantee that each k-mer corresponding to an inser- tion of a read alignment has a position in the reference genome.
To achieve this, we append the inserted k-mer to the end of the genome sequence.
In our implementation of the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph, we first iteratively load sections of the reference genome into memory.
Then we perform the following operation.
We test for each k-mer in each aligned read at genome position g, whether there is already a k-mer at g and whether the new k-mer can be joined with it.
If so then we join the two k-mers  otherwise, we attach the new k-mer to position g. The connection between two k-mers is recorded by using pointers, and the read coverage for each k-mer is stored along with it.
Figure 2 illus- trates the main advantages of the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph compared with the positional de Bruijn graph with several examples (see also Table 1).
This includes the contig-guided PE read alignment against the reference genome resulting in a larger number of alignable reads, and thus a more complete de Bruijn graph (Fig.
2B), as well as the reduction of branched paths in the graph by distinguishing reads from different repetitive regions (Fig.
2C and D).
For space reasons, the ad- vantages over the conventional de Bruijn graph in reducing false-positive and incomplete paths are not shown.
The PE multipositional de Bruijn graph can converge to the positional de Bruijn graph by relaxing the above constraints (2), (3), (5) and (6).
In our tests, the former shows usually an up to 5% better performance than the latter with respect to several sensitivity measures (see below for definitions).
This improvement is considerable because the number of branches that are only resolvable by the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph is usually not large.
(iii) Graph traversal returns extended contigs To remove errors, the de Bruijn graph needs to be edited before its traversal.
The three major types of errors are tips, bubbles and erroneous connections (Chaisson and Pevzner, 2008  Peng et al., 2010  Zerbino and Birney, 2008).
Most of them are caused by errors in the reads.
A tip is a short path with a dead end, whereas a bubble consists of two short paths sharing the same start and end nodes.
Most of the tips and bubbles can be corrected by joining k-mers with 5  mismatches.
The remaining errors can be removed by applying a coverage cut-off filter similar to the strategies used by most de novo assemblers.
Because of the add- itional information encoded in the modified de Bruijn graph, one can use here a relatively small coverage threshold.
After these error removal steps, the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph is traversed, using a breadth-first strategy, to generate the final contigs.
Each traversal stops at a branch position and an extended contig is returned.
After returning the extended contigs, the remaining unextended contigs (iden- tical with initial de novo contigs) are provided to the user in a separate file.
Finally, contigs with sufficient PE read connections and a path between them can be joined.
Occasionally, those connections can be missed by the above filtering step because of too low read coverage in local areas of the connecting path.

Advantages of the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph compared with the positional de Bruijn graph.
In the target genome given on the top, A and A0  C and C0  E and E0  G and G0 are repetitive regions.
Each PE read of length 2  4 bp is sequenced with one pair from region ABCDA0C0 and the other from the corresponding position of region EFGHE0G0 (the pair from EFGHE0G0 is omitted for simplicity).
In comparison with the target genome, the reference genome has a repeat-free region ABC similar to ABCDA0C0 and a region EFGHE0 similar to EFGHE0G0.
The reads from region ABCDA0C0 are assembled with a de novo assembler into a contig starting from CDA0C0, but regions A and B are not assembled because of low sequencing depth, repeats or other problems.
When aligning the contig to the reference genome, the repetitive regions C and C0 are both aligned to C in the reference genome, and the insertion D is assigned to the end of the reference.
In (A) reads are aligned directly to the reference genome to build the initial positional de Bruijn graph, and in (B D) the reads are aligned to the preassembled contigs and then aligned to the reference to build first the extended positional de Bruijn graph and then the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph.
(A) The initial positional de Bruijn graph is built here with 3-mers.
Some reads cannot be aligned to the reference genome because of sequence differences in the target genome, as indicated here by 3-mers with  1 as alignment position.
The repetitive regions A and A0 (or C and C0) are collapsed into one path in red in the graph.
(B) The initial positional de Bruijn graph is constructed with help from the read-to-contig alignment information.
The read-to-reference genome alignment information yields a more complete positional de Bruijn graph, but the repetitive regions A and A0 (or C and C0) are still collapsed resulting in branch points.
(C) An extended positional de Bruijn graph is built by incorporating into each 3-mer the read alignment position to the contig.
As a result of this operation, the repetitive regions C and C0 can be distinguished into two paths, where the 3-mers have different alignment positions in the contig, but A and A0 are still collapsed.
(D) The PE multi- positional de Bruijn graph is constructed by incorporating into each 3-mer their PE read alignment positions to the reference genome (the right three bases and their alignment position to the contig is omitted here).
With this information the repeats A and A0 can be distinguished into two paths, as the 3-mers have different PE alignment positions in the reference genome.
The final graph contains only one single path allowing to output an extended contig corresponding to the region ABCDA0C0 in the target genome  i323   E.Bao et al.
2.2 Software implementation AlignGraph is implemented in C++ for Linux operating systems.
Its required input includes the PE reads, the preassembled de novo contigs and the reference genome.
Its output includes the extended contigs as well as the remaining non-extended contigs.
AlignGraph runs the alignment steps with BLAT and Bowtie2 automatically, but both need to be in- stalled on the system.
AlignGraph s run time is currently 23 57 min per million aligned reads.
In the performance tests of this study, the memory usage was 36 50 GB, and it stays 5100 GB even for entire mammalian genomes.
These requirements are more moderate than those of most de novo assemblers (Luo et al., 2012).
3 EVALUATION  3.1 Experimental design  Background To evaluate AlignGraph s efficiency in improving genome assemblies, we performed a series of systematic perform- ance tests.
For this, we downloaded publicly available assemblies and/or assembled genomic PE read sets from organisms of vari- able genome complexity with seven widely used de novo assem- blers, extended the resulting contigs with AlignGraph, and then evaluated the improvements with a set of standard metrics for comparing assembly results (Table 2).
In these tests, it was im- portant to choose the NGS read samples from organisms where the genome sequence of both the target genome and a close ref- erence genome are known.
This way one can evaluate the com- pleteness and correctness of the results against a true result rather than one that is unknown or only partially known.
To also assure the improvements obtained by AlignGraph are not simply the result of insufficient optimizations of the upstream de novo assembly, we included preassembled contig and scaffold sets that are widely accepted by the community as benchmark datasets for evaluating assembly software.
Today s requirements for assembling genomes from NGS were met by choosing read samples with  75 bp and PE read information.
In total, we per- formed assembly tests on the following three sample sets.
3.1.1 Arabidopsis thaliana sample The first sample set was from the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, which is a flowering plant with a compact genome of 130 Mb in size.
The PE read set chosen for this test is from a genomic Illumina NGS library with a read length of 2  75 bp.
As de novo assemblers, we included in this test Velvet and ABySS, which we chose here as software representatives performing well on single library data and be- cause of their good sensitivity and precision performance (Lin et al., 2011).
The VelvetOptimiser tool was used to optimize the parameter settings for the Velvet assembly.
ABySS was run with the same k-mer length as Velvet, whereas the remaining param- eters were set to their defaults.
To extend the preassembled con- tigs with AlignGraph, we used the publicly available genome sequence from the related Arabidopsis lyrata species as reference [Table 2(a)].
The latter was chosen because it constitutes a more challenging reference genome for testing AlignGraph s perform- ance in improving genome assemblies than the references used in the other tests below.
This is the case for the following reasons (Hu et al., 2011): A.lyrata and A.thaliana diverged 410 million years ago  their genomes differ by many regional rearrange- ments  the sequence similarity in the common regions of their  i324  genomes is only 80%  and the A.lyrata genome sequence is still incomplete and fragmented into many scaffolds.
3.1.2 Human sample from Genome Assembly Gold-standard Evaluations The second sample set is from the community pro- ject GAGE (Genome Assembly Gold-standard Evaluations), from which we selected the sample for the human chromosome 14 (Salzberg et al., 2012).
Its Illumina sequences consist of PE reads with a length of 76 101 bp from three different libraries.
We downloaded the preassembled contig sets provided by the GAGE project for the five assemblers that ranked highest in the benchmark tests by Salzberg et al.
(2012) in assemblies from multiple genome libraries with variable insert lengths.
Those included ALLPATHS-LG, SOAPdenovo, MaSuRCA, CABOG and Bambus2.
As reference sequence for guiding AlignGraph, we genome.
For ALLPATH-LG in its cheat mode, we reassembled the contigs ourselves because this assembler exhibits a better sensitivity and precision performance when providing a closely related reference genome.
Here it was important to compare the performance of ALLPATHS-LG with AlignGraph when both are guided by the same reference genome.
chimpanzee  used  the  In addition to contigs, we evaluated AlignGraph s perform- ance in improving the scaffold sets provided by the GAGE pro- ject for the same human sample set.
Before their reassembly with AlignGraph, we reduced the number of unresolved sequence re- gions (gaps filled with ambiguous N bases) in the scaffolds by applying the GapFiller algorithm, which is currently one of the most efficient gap-filling methods (Boetzer and Pirovano, 2012).
To also evaluate the influence of the similarity shared among the reference and target genomes on AlignGraph s performance, we included tests with four reference genomes of variable simi- larity to the human genome.
The reference genomes chosen for this test were from gorilla, orangutan, gibbon and macaque.
The genome sequence from gibbon was the only one that is still in- complete containing scaffolds rather than fully assembled chromosomes.
3.1.3 Published genome In addition to the tests above, we were interested in evaluating to what extent AlignGraph can improve the genome sequence generated with another reference assisted assembly approach.
For this test, we chose the published genome sequence from Landsberg erecta (Ler-1  Schneeberger et al., 2011).
The latter is a strain of A.thaliana, which is too diverged from the known references to resolve its genome sequence with a simple resequencing approach.
Thus, Schneeberger et al.
(2011) assembled its genome with a reference-assisted pipeline approach that included ALLPATHS-LG and several refinement steps.
3.1.4 Data sources The genome sequences used in the above tests were downloaded from the following community sites: A.thaliana from TAIR, A.lyrata from JGI, Landsberg erecta from 1001 Genomes and human and other primates from Ensembl.
From the GAGE site, we downloaded the PE read sets and the preassembled contigs and scaffolds for the human chromosome 14 sample (Salzberg et al., 2012).
The PE read sets from A.thaliana and Landsberg erecta were downloaded from NCBI s Sequence Read Archive and the 1001 Genome site, re- spectively.
The A.thaliana read set contained 32 million 2  75 bp PE reads (accession: SRR073127), the human read set contained   Table 2.

The resulting contigs were extended with AlignGraph using as reference the genome sequence from A.lyrata.
(b c) The subsequent panels contain assembly results for the human chromosome 14 sample from the GAGE project where the chimpanzee genome served as reference.
(b) Contig assembly results are given for the de novo assemblers ALLPATHS-LG, ALLPATHS-LGc (in cheat mode), SOAPdenovo, MaSuRCA, CABOG and Bambus2.
(c) Scaffolded assembly results are given for SOAPdenovo, MaSuRCA, CABOG and Bambus2.
The results are organized row-wise as follows: the number of initial contigs obtained by each de novo assembler1, the  extendable  subset of the initial contigs that AlignGraph was able to improve2, and the extension results obtained with AlignGraph3.
The additional columns give the number of contigs4, N50 values5, the number of covered bases6, the average7, and maximum8 length of the contigs, the number of misassemblies per million base pairs (MPMB)9, and the average identity among the true contigs and the target genome10.
More details on these performance criteria are provided in Section 3.1.5.
62 million 2  76 101 bp PE reads and the Ler-1 read set con- tained 73 million 2  40 101 bp PE reads.
3.1.5 Performance measurements Most of the performance measures used by this study are adapted from the GAGE project (Salzberg et al., 2012).
To evaluate the completeness of the con- tigs, we aligned them to the target genome with BLAT.
If a contig could not be aligned as a single global alignment, it was  split according to the local alignment results into the smallest possible number of subcontigs.
The resulting contigs are called true contigs.
The precision measures include the number of mis- assemblies per million base pairs (MPMB) and the average iden- tity between contigs and target genome.
Misassemblies caused by misjoin errors result in chimeric contigs.
Their number can be calculated as the number of splits necessary to obtain the true contigs.
Thus, MPMB = m  L   106, where m is the numbers of  i325   E.Bao et al.
n ti   li P n li  misassemblies, and L is the cumulative length of the contigs.
The average identity between true contigs and the target genome is  P  where ti is the identity for contig i, and li calculated as is the length of contig i (05i   n).
In this formula, the identity ti of the true contigs i is calculated as the number of aligned bases over the length of the alignment.
The sensitivity measures include the N50 value and the number of covered bases.
The former is the contig size at 50% of the total number of contig bases, and the latter is the total number of genome bases covered by the contigs.
Two additional measures are the average length and maximum length of the true contigs.
In all tests, we considered only contigs with a length of at least 1000 bp but used the entire set (including the shorter ones) in AlignGraph s extension steps.
3.2 Results  3.2.1 Extension of A.thaliana contigs The performance test re- sults for the A.thaliana dataset are given in Table 2(a).
In com- parison with the initial contig sets assembled by Velvet or ABySS, AlignGraph extends 28.7 37.8% of them when guided by the A.lyrata genome as reference.
The resulting set of ex- tended contigs contains 27.9 33.2% less sequences because AlignGraph has joined many of the initial contigs.
This leads to improvements of the N50, the number of covered bases, aver- age contig length and maximum contig length for the extendable contig set by 89.9 94.5%, 15.9 24.1%, 69.3 69.2% and 54.9  81.6%, respectively.
These improvements are accompanied only by minor increases of MPMB errors.
The MPMB values of the extendable and extended contigs are usually much lower than for the complete set because of their pre-filtered nature that improves their quality.
As expected the average identity also drops slightly (2.8 2.9%) because with increased length of the assembled sequences, internal sequence variations accumulate and complicate the alignment of the extended contigs against the target genome.
A similar trend can be seen in the results below for the much longer scaffolds where the average identity is always lower for all of the tested assemblers [Table 2(c)].
For all three sample sets (Sections 3.2.1 3.2.4), the AlignGraph re- sults contain a comparable number of sequence variations to the target genomes as the results of de novo assemblers (data not shown).
This indicates a high sequence quality of the reassembled contigs.
3.2.2 Extension of human contigs and scaffolds from GAGE The test results for the human chromosome 14 contigs are given in Table 2(b).
Of the contigs assembled by ALLPATHS-LG, 38.2% can be extended and the extension result contains 53.1% less contigs because of the joins generated by AlignGraph.
These improvements are more pronounced than in the above experi- ment with A.lyrata as reference because the genomes of human and chimpanzee share a much higher sequence similarity than the genomes of A.thaliana and A.lyrata.
The N50, the number of covered bases, average contig length and maximum contig length for the extendable contig set consistently improve by 80.3, 1.9, 118.0 and 52.6%, respectively.
Similar results could be obtained with the other de novo assemblers SOAPdenovo, MaSuRCA, CABOG and Bambus2.
After AlignGraph process- ing, their extendable contigs improved for the same four  i326  Table 3.

evaluation metrics by 88.8 165.8, 3.4 16.8, 82.6 160.6 and 30.3 54.8%, respectively.
If ALLPATHS-LG is run in its cheat mode by guiding it with the same reference genome as AlignGraph, then both the sensitivity and precision measures of the ALLPATHS-LGc contigs improve compared with the assembly without a reference.
Nevertheless, AlignGraph is still able to extend 33.6% of the ALLPATHS-LGc contigs, and the extension results contain 53.1% less contigs, whereas the four evaluation metrics improve by 89.4, 10.0, 123.5 and 7.0%, re- spectively.
These improvements indicate that the reference-as- sisted approach used by AlignGraph is more efficient than the one from ALLPATHS-LG in its cheat mode at the contig as- sembly stage.
AlignGraph s performance results on the scaffolds from the same human chromosome 14 dataset are given in Table 2(c).
The scaffold sets from SOAPdenovo, MaSuRCA, CABOG and Bambus2 contain much smaller numbers of sequences than their corresponding contig sets.
Nevertheless, AlignGraph is able to extend 11.6 31.0% of them and improve the N50 value and the number of covered bases by 9.4 152.7 and 14.8 29.0%, respectively.
The extension results for the scaffold set of Bambus2 contain a slightly larger number of sequences (14) than the extendable set.
The reason for this is that many of them are short, and AlignGraph extends them often to scaffolds with a length above the 1000 bp requirement, thus increasing the number of reported scaffolds (see Section 3.1.5).
This trend also explains the slightly lower average length of the extended scaffold set from Bambus2.
3.2.3 Influence of similarity of reference genome To assess AlignGraph s performance with reference genomes of variable similarity to the target genome, we post-processed the de novo assemblies of the human dataset with AlignGraph using as ref- erence the genome sequences from five different primates.
The columns in Table 3 list these organisms according to their evo- lutionary distances to the human genome (increasing from left to right).
To avoid confusions, exact sequence similarity values to the human genome are not provided because there are many possibilities to calculate them, which can lead to different results.
As expected, the performance measures degrade with the evolu- tionary distance between the target and reference genomes.
Although the first four reference genomes show respectable im- provements, the macaque genome seems to be too diverged from   Table 4.

human to achieve any major improvements.
However, this per- formance drop is mainly due to the difficulty of aligning short reads to a highly diverged reference.
Future improvements in NGS read length and alignment algorithms are likely to enhance AlignGraph s performance in this regard.
3.2.4 Improvements to published genome The test results for the published Landsberg erecta genome are shown in Table 4.
The initial scaffold set used in this test consisted of 1676 sequences.
AlignGraph extended 27.6% of these scaffolds, whereas the ex- tended set contains 20.3% fewer In addition, AlignGraph improves the N50 value, the number of covered bases, the average contig length and maximum length values for the extendable scaffolds by 86.6, 8.1, 35.7 and 8.1%, respect- ively.
These improvements demonstrate AlignGraph s usefulness in improving published genome sequences, even for those that have been carefully curated by their authors.
scaffolds.
In summary,  the above performance tests demonstrate AlignGraph s efficiency in improving the results of a variety of de novo assemblers and species with variable genome complexity by taking advantage of closely related reference genomes.
4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  This study introduces a novel de Bruijn graph-based algorithm for improving de novo genome assemblies guided by sequence information from a closely related species.
The chosen PE multipositional de Bruijn graph approach provides an elegant and efficient solution to this problem.
Our performance results demonstrate that the implemented AlignGraph software is able to improve the results of a wide range of de novo assemblers for complex genomes even with relatively diverse and suboptimal guide sequences as reference.
Moreover, our results demonstrate AlignGraph s usefulness improving unfinished genome assemblies.
Another advantage is that AlignGraph can be used in combination with most existing de novo assemblers.
In the future, we will expand AlignGraph in the following areas: (i) we will provide support for additional variant-aware alignment tools for both PE read and contig data, such as GSNAP and GMAP, respectively, (ii) de novo assembly functionality will be added to AlignGraph to further optimize assemblies at many stages of the reference-assisted workflow, (iii) utilities will be  for  AlignGraph  incorporated for detecting and resolving misassemblies either in the initial contigs or in the extensions and (iv) the processing of scaffolds with large gaps will be improved.
