Abstract
During the last decade, biogerontologists have labored to understand the biological basis of the aging
process by studying the genes and signaling pathways that regulate it. But the last year has seen a
breakthrough in a different direction: toward treatments that might slow aging by mimicking the
effects of dietary restriction.

Introduction and context
The effects of biological aging make up a sizeable
proportion of the sum of human suffering. Aging is the
predominant risk factor for the many horrible illnesses of
later life, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and
neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.
From a biological perspective, aging very much resem-
bles a complex disease syndrome [1,2]. Because of this
complexity, treatments for aging for have long seemed
a forlorn hope. Moreover, the biological mechanisms
of aging remain uncertain, although several promising
hypotheses (e.g., that aging is caused by the accumulation
of molecular damage) are currently under investigation
[3]. Yet recent developments suggest that it might be
feasible to treat aging even without fully understanding it.

In laboratory animals, it is possible to slow aging by
using a variety of interventions – dietary, genetic, and
pharmacological. For example, dietary restriction (DR),
the measured reduction of food intake without starva-
tion, can increase life span in organisms ranging from
budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to dogs [4]. An
important detail is that organisms under DR remain in a
youthful state into late life and are resistant to aging-
associated pathologies. This is consistent with the view of
aging as a single, complex disease syndrome.

How does DR act to slow aging? One idea is that it affects
nutrient-sensitive endocrine and intracellular signaling

pathways that regulate aging. This is supported by
studies of long-lived mutants (e.g., in the nematode
worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster). These studies have identified a network of
nutrient- and stress-sensitive pathways that control
aging. For example, mutations that reduce insulin/
insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS) can increase
adult life spans in worms (as much as 10-fold [5]), flies,
and mice [6].

Were these DR-responsive pathways druggable, then,
in principle, one could induce a DR-like state with
resistance to aging-related disease. Such DR mimetic
drugs could be an efficient way to improve late-life health
and well-being in the future [7]. Several nutrient-sensing
pathways, including IIS and the NAD+-dependent his-
tone deacetylases (sirtuins), have been postulated to
mediate the effects of DR [4]. Initial reports suggested
that DR-induced longevity in yeast, worms, and flies was
attributable to sirtuin activation, although this was
subsequently challenged [4]. Also pursued were sirtuin-
activating DR mimetic drugs such as the plant-derived
polyphenol resveratrol. However, initial observations of
sirtuin activation by resveratrol seem attributable to
experimental artefact [8].

Recent studies have focused increasingly on a different
nutrient-sensing pathway, which includes target of rapa-
mycin (TOR) kinase and ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K).

This pathway regulates cell growth, ribosome biogenesis,
and protein turnover. Evidence from yeast, worms, and
flies suggests that this pathway mediates the effects of DR
on life span [4,6]. The proximal mechanisms involved
remain unclear, although a candidate effector in yeast is
the nutrient-sensitive transcription factor Gcn4 [9]. These
findings raise a number of questions: Does the TOR/S6K
pathway influence aging and mediate the effects of DR
in mammals? Could drugs that target this pathway act
as DR mimetics? Could these work in humans? This last
year has seen progress in providing answers to all of these
questions.

Major recent advances
First, it was shown that mutation-induced loss of mouse
S6K1 increases life span and resistance to age-related
pathologies [10]. Also, the physiology and gene expres-
sion of S6K1 mutant mice resembled those of wild-type
mice subjected to DR. This suggests that, as in lower
organisms, TOR/S6K signaling mediates DR effects. If this

view is correct, then pharmacological inhibition of this
pathway should recapitulate the effects of DR. Consistent
with this, it was recently shown that the TOR inhibitor
rapamycin (sirolimus) increases life span in flies [11] and
also in mice, in which it was administered from mid-life
onwards [12]. This perhaps suggests broad efficacy of DR
mimetics consumed in later life.

S6K1 mutant mice also showed elevated activation of
the nutrition-sensitive enzyme AMPK (adenosine
monophosphate-activated kinase) [10], hinting that
AMPK activation might promote longevity under DR.
In C. elegans, longevity induced by loss of S6K (rsks-1)
proved to be AMPK-dependent [10], supporting this
view. The biguanide drug metformin, widely used as a
treatment for type 2 diabetes, activates AMPK, inhibits
TOR [13], and can induce a DR-like mRNA profile in
mice [14]. It can also increase life span in both worms
[15] and short-lived mouse strains [16] but not in
male rats [17]. However, aging seems to be more

The pathways that mediate the effects of DR have been delineated in model organisms (worms, flies, mice, and rhesus monkeys). The challenges now are to
understand how DR works and to apply these findings to humans. Red indicates recent discoveries. S6K, ribosomal S6 kinase; TOR, target of rapamycin.

difficult to slow in males; for example, effects on
aging in S6K1 mutant mice are confined largely to
females [10]. The greater phenotypic plasticity (in
aging) that females seem to possess warrants further
investigation.

Whether DR slows human aging remains unclear.
However, studies were initiated in the late 1980s to
discover whether DR can increase life span in primates
(rhesus macaques).
Interim results were reported
recently and show that DR does reduce pathology and,
potentially, mortality [18], consistent with results of an
earlier, smaller trial [19].

Future directions
These recent discoveries motivate further studies that
could pave the way to DR mimetic drugs for humans
(Figure 1). Here, many questions remain. For example,
does DR slow human aging? There are hints that it might.
In Okinawa, Japan, a culture of DR is associated with an
elevated frequency of centenarians [20], and in the US,
those who practice DR show signs of improved cardio-
vascular health [21]. But further human studies, such as
the ongoing CALERIE (Comprehensive Assessment of the
Long-term Effect of Reducing Intake of Energy) study [22],
are needed. Also, is there any evidence that metformin,
rapamycin, or related compounds might slow human
aging? Here, effects on diseases that are aging-related may
provide clues. For example, DR reduces cancer incidence,
at least in rodents and non-human primates, as do
rapamycin and metformin [23]. Another issue is adverse
side effects. Metformin can cause gastrointestinal upset,
and rapamycin has immunosuppressant effects. To be a
practical medical intervention, DR mimetics would need
to be effective without inducing significant side effects. A
final remaining question is how the TOR/S6K pathway
controls aging. To answer this, the puzzle of aging itself
will need to be solved.
