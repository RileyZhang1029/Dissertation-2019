Abstract: During the cholera survey in Namdinh province (northern Vietnam) in July, 2010, one strain of Vibrio cholerae 
O139 was isolated from 7 environmental water samples positive for ctxA, toxR, VCO139 genes and named as V. cholerae 
O139, ND1 strain. This  strain was lysogenic harbouring  a genome similar to the  filamentous phage fs1. The replicative 
form DNA of this phage (named as ND1-fs1, 6856 bp) was sequenced and compared with the other filamentous phages. 
The filamentous phage ND1-fs1 integrates into the region between ctxB and rtxA genes. The genetic organization of the 
CTX(cid:1) of V. cholerae O139, strain ND1 was determined and the schematic representation of the genetic organization was 
shown together with the ND1-fs1 prophage. 

Keywords: Vibrio cholerae O139, filamentous phage fs1, ctx gene cassette.  

INTRODUCTION  

  Vibrio cholerae O139 Bengal has caused large explosive 
outbreaks  in  India,  Bangladesh  and  neighbouring  countries 
since  it  first  appeared  in  late  1992.  In  1993,  nine  cases  
were  reported  from  Bangkok,  Thailand  [1].  In  spite  of  
rapid  spread  of  O139  in  Southeast  Asia,  however,  little 
information  on  cholera  in  Vietnam  due  to  O139  is  available 
in the national and international scientific literature.  

  Therefore,  we  conducted  a  survey  on  cholera  due  to  V. 
cholerae  O139  between  2006  and  2010  in  Vietnam  to  shed 
light  on  the  present  situation  of  V.  cholerae  O139  in  the 
aquatic  environment  in  Vietnam.  During  the  survey  in 
Namdinh  in  2010,  we  isolated  one  strain  of  V.  cholerae 
O139  from  an  aquatic  environment.  Strains  of  V.  cholerae 
O139  are  subtyped  according  to  the  organization  of  CTX(cid:1) 
[2].  
  The  6.9  kb  CTX(cid:1) genome  contains  genes  of  core  and 
RS2  regions.The  core  region  encodes  ctxA,B  and  contains 
genes  involved  in  phage  morphogenesis.  The  RS2  region 
contains  genes  required  for  replication  (rstA),  integration 
(rstB)  and regulation (rstR) of CTX(cid:1)  [3]. The  CTX(cid:1) is often 
flanked  by  the  satellite  phage  RS1  that  contains  the

rstC  gene  in  addition  to  genes  present  in  the  RS2  element 
[4]. Based on the variations in the repressor gene rstR, CTX(cid:1) 
has  been  classified  into  three  major  types,  CTXClass (cid:1) 
(Classical  type),  CTXET (cid:1)  (El  Tor  type),  and  CTXCalc (cid:1) 
(Calcutta  type)  [5].  In  addition  to  the  CTX(cid:1), another  two 
types of filamentous phage group are reported in V. cholerae 
O139,i.e. fs1 group (fs1, VGJ (cid:1), VSK, VEJ (cid:1))  and fs2 group 
(fs2, phage 493). 

  We  report  the  characterization  of  V.  cholerae  O139, 
strain ND1, first isolated in Vietnam with special attention to 
the  CTX(cid:1)  organization  and  the  other  filamentous  phage 
integration. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Sampling Sites  

  Water samples were  collected in May 2010 at 14 sites in 
Namdinh  province,  including  a  deep  well,  a  container  for 
rain, and 1 kg of home made ice. The other 11 samples were 
collected  from  a  large  canal.  The  ice  was  left  in  a  sterile 
plastic beaker to thaw, then transferred into a 1L-bottle. Each 
water  sample  was  collected  500  ml  in  a  sterile  1L  glass 
bottle. 

  The  sampling  sites  were  located  120  km  from  the 
National  Institute  of  Hygiene  and  Epidemiology  (NIHE). 
The  samples  were  sent  to  NIHE  at  room  temperature  by  car 
as soon as collected.

Bacteriology 

  Each 450-ml water sample was mixed in a 1L flask with 
50  ml  of  10  X  alkaline  peptone  water  (Bactopeptone  10%, 
NaCl  10%;  pH  8.5)  used  as  an  enrichment  medium  and 
incubated  at  37°C  for  18h.  Thiosulfate-citrate  bile  salts-
sucrose  agar  (TCBS;  Eiken,  Tokyo,  Japan)  was  used  as  
the  selective  medium  for  the  isolation  of  V.  cholerae. 
Presumptive  identification  was  performed  on  the  basis  of 
standard  biochemical  reactions,  including  oxidase  activity, 
Gram  stain,  growth  in  nutrient  broth  containing  0%  NaCl, 
and  acid  production  from  glucose,  inositol,  mannitol,  and 
sucrose.  All  suspected  V.  cholerae  isolates  were  tested  by 
agglutination  tests  with  polyvalent  O1  and  O139  antisera. 
Ten ml of culture in alkaline peptone water was used for the 
extraction of genomic DNA. 

DNA Extraction from Water Samples 

  Ten  ml  of  alkaline  peptone  water  (primary  culture)  was 
harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 10 min at 4°C. The 
pellet  was  resuspended  in  600  μl  of  TESS  buffer  (30  mM 
Tris-HCl,  pH  7.5,  5  mM  EDTA,  25%  sucrose),  then 
supplemented  with  200 μl  of  lysozyme  (5  mg/ml  in  10  mM 
Tris HCl [pH 8.0]., 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl) and kept at 
37 °C for 30 min.One hundred μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml 
in  autoclaved  water))  was  added  to  the  suspension  and 
further  incubated  for  30  min  at  37°C,  then  100  μl  of  10% 
sodium  dodecyl  sulfate  was  added  and  mixed  well.  DNA 
was extracted by the phenol  chloroform method and  ethanol 
precipitation  was  performed  as  described  by  Maniatis et  al., 
[6]. DNA was recovered using a toothpick, then washed with 
70%  ethanol  once  and  with  100%  ethanol  once,  dried  by 
Micro  Vac  (TOMY,,  Tokyo,  Japan),  then  suspended  with 
200 μl of sterilized water and stored at -20°C until use. 

DNA Extraction from a Pure Culture 

 
In  the  case  of  pure  culture,  Vibrio  cholerae  O139  was 
grown  overnight  in  10  ml  of  LB  (Luria-Bertani)  broth  [6]. 
Total  cellular  DNA  was  extracted  and  purified  as  described 
above. 

Multiplex PCR 

  The  primers  used  in  this  study  are  listed  in  Table  1. 
Amplification  with  the  four  primer  pairs  was  performed 
simultaneously  in  0.2  ml  microcentrifuge  tubes.  Samples  (1 
μl)  were  added  to  the  PCR  mixture  in  a  30 μl  volume  of  a 
final  mixture  of  GoTaq  Green  Master  Mix  (Promega, 
Madison,  WI,  USA)  containing  0.25  μM  of  each  pair  of 
primers  for  toxR,  ctxA,  O1,  and  O139.  The  amplification 
conditions  were  as  follows:  5  min  at  94°C  for  initial 
denaturation of DNA and 35 cycles, each consisting of 1 min 
at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, 1 min at 72°C, with a final one cycle of 
extension for 7 min at 72°C in an iCycler (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).  

Purification of Replicative form DNA (RF DNA) 

  The  RF  DNA  was  extracted  from  a  10  ml  culture  in  LB 
broth by using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). 

GENE,  Tokyo,  Japan),  separated  by  electrophoresis  in  1  % 
agarose  gels  and  blotted  on  to  nylon  membrane  (Hybond-
N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotec) by Southern blotting [14]. 
The  gene  probe  used  to  detect  ctxA  was  a  0.56  kb  fragment 
amplified  by  PCR  from  V.  cholerae  A104,  an  El  Tor  strain 
isolated in Kenya  in 1983; the  CTX(cid:1)  core probe was 1.5 kb 
fragment amplified from the same strain; RS probe was a 0.9 
kb amplified from the same strain; rstRET probe was a 320 bp 
PCR  amplified  product  from  the  same  strain, zot  probe  was  
a  0.84  kb  fragment  amplified  from  the  same  strain  by  
PCR  The  probes  used  for  hybridization  were  labeled  with  
the DIG DNA Labeling and Detection Kit (Roche Molecular 
Biochemicals,  Indianapolis,  Ind).  For  Southern  hybridization, 
the  membranes  were  prehybridized  at  42°C  for  30  min  in  a 
solution  containing  2x  SSC  (1x  SSCis  0.15  M  NaCl  plus 
0.015 sodium citrate). The membranes were then hybridized 
with  the  freshly  denatured  digoxigenin-labeled  gene  probes 
at  42°C  for  15  h.  The  hybridized  membranes  were  washed 
twice  in  2x  SSC-9.1%  SDS  for  5  min  at  room  temperature 
and  twice  in  0.1x  SSC-0.1%  SDS  for  15  min  at  68°C.  
Non  radioactive  detection  was  based  on  digoxigenin-anti-
digoxigenin enzyme–linked immunosorbent assay, according 
to the instructions for the DIG DNA Labeling and Detection 
Kit  instructions.  For  typing  of  the  filamentous  phage,  heat-
denatured  RF  DNA  of  filamentous  phage  fs1  was  used  for 
Southern blotting after labeling with digoxigenin. 

Nucleotide and Protein Sequence Analysis 

  Each  PCR  amplicon  was  gel  purified  by  using  QIAEX® 
(Qiagen).  Nucleotide  sequencing  of  all  PCR  products  was 
carried  out  with  the  Taq  Dye-terminator  Sequencing  Kit 
(Perkin-Elmer)  and  an  ABI  PRISM®  3100  Avant  Genetic 
Analyzer  (Applied  Biosystems).  The  BLAST  program  was 
used  to  search  for  homologous  DNA  and  protein  sequences 
in databases. 

Electron Microscopy (EM) 

  The  Filamentous  phage  from  a  V.  cholerae  O139  was 
purified  as  reported  before  [15].  For  negative  staining,  one 
drop  of  the  phage  solution  was  placed  on  a  sheet  of 
PARAFILM”M”  (American  Can  Co.,  Greenwich,  Conn., 
U.S.A.) and a Formvar-coated copper grid was floated on the 
drop for 2 min. The excess solution was removed with filter 
paper.  The  specimen  was  washed  3  times  with  distilled 
water,  then  stained  with  1%  uranyl  acetate  for  30  sec.  The 
excess  stain  was  removed  by  blotting  with  a  filter  paper.  
The  specimen  was  examined  with  a  JEOL  JEM  1230 
transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV. 

Nucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers 

  The  nucleotide  sequences  of  ND1-fs1,  attR,  attL  regions 
and  ctxB  gene  of  V.  cholerae  O139,  strain  ND1  were 
deposited  in  the  GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ  database  under 
accession  numbers  AB572858,  AB646687,  AB646688,  and 
AB615200.

Surprisingly,  a  positive  sample  was  found  in  the  ice, 
which was produced locally under poor hygienic conditions, 
but  the  water  from  a  deep  well,  used  for  making  ice,  was 
negative for VCO1, VCO139, toxR, ctxA. However, six of the 
environmental  water  samples  were  positive  for  VCO139, 
toxR,  ctxA.  This  finding  suggested  that  the 
ice  was 
contaminated  with  environmental  water,  but  the  actual 
source  of  contamination  remained  unknown.  The  sampling 
sites  were  located  along  the  same  canal.  The  first  sampling 
site is located about 10 km away from the last sampling site. 
When  an  environmental  water  sample  is  shown  to  be 
positive  for  ctxA,  VCO139,  the  source  of  contamination  
is  most 
likely  from  clinical  cases.  The  clonality  of 
environmental strains of V. cholerae O1 and O139 with ctxA 
gene  is  closely  related  with  clinical  strains  [16].  Therefore, 
the  finding  of  multiplex  PCR  suggested  the  presence  of 

sporadic  cases  of  cholera  due  to  V.  cholerae  O139  in 
Namdinh province. 

Isolation of V. cholerae O139 

  Out  of  seven  samples  found  to  be  positive  for  VCO139, 
ctxA,  toxR,  we  isolated  V.  cholerae  O139  strain  from  only 
one  sample  (lane  1  in  Fig.  1).  This  strain  was  named  as  V. 
cholerae O139, ND1. We don’t know exactly why only one 
sample  culture was positive among 7 specimens positive for 
VCO139,  ctxA,  toxR  by  PCR  But  we  experience  great 
hardships  in  isolating  V.  cholerae  O1  and  O139  from  the 
environmental water samples which show positive for VCO1 
or  VCO139  and  ctxA  by  PCR.  We  speculate  that  the  vibrio 
cell concentration may differ between 103-108 cfu/ml among 
the  samples  positive  for  ctxA,  toxR,  and  VCO1  or  VCO139.

Fig.  (1).  Multiplex  PCR  to  detect  O1,  O139,  ctxA,  and  toxR  genes  in  environmental  water  samples  in  Nam  Dinh  province  in  June 
2010. Lanes: P1, P2; positive control for VCO1 (strain HN1), VCO139 (strain AI4450) genes, 1; ice locally produced, 2; water from a deep 
well (150 m in depth), 3; water from a container for rain with a tight cover, 4-14; water samples from a canal. 

This  strain  was  lysogenic  and  produced  filamentous  phages 
similar  to  fs1  [15]  (Figs.  2  and  3).  The  phage  was  named 
ND1-fs1. 

Genomic Organization of ND1-fs1 

  The  ND1-fs1  DNA  sequence  is  similar  to  sequences  of 
other  previously  described  phages,  such  as  fs1  (96%) 
[15],  VGJ(cid:1) (97%)  [17],  VSK  (97%)[18],  and  VEJ(cid:1) (95%) 
[19].  The  whole  genome  of  ND1-fs1  consisted  of  6856 
nucleotides  and  had  a  G+C  content  of  42.9  mol%,  which  is 
slightly  lower  than  the  G+C  content  of  its  V.  cholerae  host 
(47.7%  for  chromosome  I  and  46.9%  for  chromosome  II) 
 [19].  The  ND1-fs1  genome  has  12  putative  ORFs  as  shown 
in  Fig.  (4).  It  contained  RstR,  RstA,  RstB,  RstC,  zot  like 
protein,  and  minor  and  major  coat  proteins.  This  phage  was 
integrated in an environmental V. cholerae O139. The role of 
this  type  of  filamentous  phage  in  pathogenesis  remaines  
to  be  clarified.  The  other  type  of  filamentous  phage  fs2  
may  play  an  important  role  in  vivo.  These  two  types  

of  filamentous  phages  were  found  in  fresh  strains  of  
V. cholerae O1 (manuscript in preparation). 

Integration  Site  for  ND1-fs1  in  V.  cholerae  O139,  Strain 
ND1 

Since  the  ND1-fs1  phage  is  similar  to  fs1,  VGJ(cid:1), VSK, 
 
and  VEJ(cid:1),   the  integration  site  for  ND1-fs1  was  sought 
between ctxB and rtxA genes. The two amplicons, ca. 500 bp 
and  600  bp,  produced  by  PCR  with  the  two  sets  of  primers 
ctxB-F2  /  attP-L-R  and  attP-R-F  /  rtxA-Ri  were  exactly  the 
left  and  right 
junction,  respectively,  as  revealed  by 
sequencing  (Fig.  5).  When  amplified  using  the  two  sets  of 
primers,  3’zot-F/  rtxA-Ri  and  ctxB-F2  /  rtxA-Ri,  two 
amplicons  of  2  kb  and  700  bp  appeared  (Fig.  6).  The 
sequence  data  of  these  two  amplicons  showed  that  the  two 
sequences were identical  to  those between zot and rtxA, and

between  ctxB  and  rtxA  genes,

integration  by  ND1-fs1,  even  though  DNA  extracted  from 
the  lysogenic  strain was used  as  a  template. A similar result 
was  reported  from  K139  phage  [20],  suggesting  that  the 
template DNA from any type of lysogenic strain is a mixture 
of  two  types  of  bacteria,  lysogenic  and  non-lysogenic, 
probably due to spontaneous curring. The DNA regions with 
attP, attB, attL and attR sites are shown in Fig. (5). The attP 

sequence  of  ND1-fs1  was  similar  to  that  of  VGJ(cid:1),  but  the 
attB sequence of V. cholerae O139, strain ND1 was different 
from that of strain N16961 [17]. 
Genetic  Organization of CTX(cid:1) of  V.  cholerae 139, Strain 
ND1  

  Diverse  CTX  phages  among  Vibrio  cholerae  O139  were 
reported  [21-26].In  rstR  allele  specific  PCR,  this  strain 
(ND1) produced an amplicon of 320 bp corresponding  to El 
Tor  type  of  rstR  without  amplicons  of  rstRCalc  and  rstRClass 
(Fig. 7). This prompted us  to  investigate  the  arrangement of 
CTX  element  in  this  strain.  To  determine  the  copy  number 
and  the  arrangement  of  CTX  genetic  element,  DNA  from 
strain  ND1  was  digested  with  different  restriction  enzymes 
with recognition sites within the CTX element. Southern blot 
hybridization  of  chromosomal  DNA  digested  with  AvaI, 
BglI,  PstI,  BglII,  and  HindIII  revealed  a  single  band  with 
ctxA  probe  (Fig.  8a),  a  single  band  with  AvaI,  BglI,  BglII, 
HindIII, and  two bands with PstI on hybridization with  core 
probe  (Fig.  8b).  The  hybridization  patterns  between  RS  and 
rstRET probes (Fig. 8c and d) were similar in the 2.7 kb band. 
The  presence  of  2.7  kb  band  in  this  strain  suggests  the 
presence  of  tandemly  arranged  RS1  element  upstream  of 
CTX(cid:1)  prophage.  The  higher  intensity  of  2.7  kb  fragment 
revealed  with  the  RS  and  rstRET probes  (Fig.  8c  and  d,  lane 
BII)  suggested  the  presence  of  more  than  one  copy  of  the 
rstRET  gene.  The  restriction  enzyme  BglII  has  one  site  in 
rstRET  The  hybridization  pattern  with  zot  probe  showed  a 
single  band  with  AvaI,  PstI,  BglII  and  two  bands  with  BglI

some  difference 

In conclusion, V. cholerae O139 seemed to spread widely 
 
in the environmental water sources in northern Vietnam. Our 
findings  suggested  the  significance  of  testing  diarrhea 
specimens with  attention  to V. cholerae O139. We found an 
environmental strain of V. cholerae O139 with an integrated 
filamentous  phage.  Filamentous  phages  of  V.  cholerae  were 
reported  after  the  appearance  of  V.  cholerae  O139  [15,  27]. 
We 
the 
lysogenicity  between  V.  cholerae  O1  and  O139.  The  strain 
of  ND1  has  an  El  Tor  type  of  ctxB  gene  (AB15200)  and  a 
single copy of the  ctx gene.  Most strains isolated  in India  in 
1993 had two copies of the ctx gene in tandem connected by 
two RSs [28]. Previously we reported the integration sites of 
vibriophage  fs2  in  a  classical  strain  and  in  a  strain  of  V. 
cholerae  O139  [29].  It  is  noteworthy  to  examine  whether 
two  filamentous  phages,  fs1  and  fs2  integrate  into  the 
chromosome  of  epidemic  strains  of  V.  cholerae  O1  at  the 
same time as shown in this study and the previous study [29] 
flanking the CTX phage.
