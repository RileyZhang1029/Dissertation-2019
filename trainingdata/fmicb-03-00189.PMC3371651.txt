We investigated the concentration dependent uptake of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and
adenosine-5(cid:2)-triphosphate (ATP) in microbial populations in the North Paciﬁc Subtrop-
ical Gyre (NPSG). We used radiotracers to measure substrate uptake into whole
water communities, differentiated microbial size classes, and two ﬂow sorted groups;
Prochlorococcus (PRO) and non-pigmented bacteria (NPB). The Pi concentrations, uptake
rates, and Pi pool turnover times (Tt) were (mean, ±SD); 54.9± 35.0 nmol L−1 (n
= 22),
4.8± 1.9 nmol L− day−1 (n = 19), and 14.7± 10.2 days (n = 19), respectively. Pi uptake into
>2 μm cells was on average 12± 7% (n = 15) of the total uptake. The kinetic response
to Pi (10–500 nmol L−1) was small, indicating that the microorganisms were close to their
maximum uptake velocity (V max). V max averaged 8.0± 3.6 nmol L−1 day−1 (n = 19) in the
>0.2 μm group, with half saturation constants (K m) of 40± 28 nmol L−1 (n = 19). PRO
had three times the cell speciﬁc Pi uptake rate of NPB, at ambient concentrations, but
when adjusted to cells L−1 the rates were similar, and these two groups were equally
competitive for Pi. The Tt of γ-P-ATP in the >0.2 μm group were shorter than for the Pi
pool (4.4± 1.0 days; n = 6), but this difference diminished in the larger size classes. The
kinetic response to ATP was large in the >0.2 μm class with V max exceeding the rates
at ambient concentrations (mean 62± 27 times; n = 6) with a mean V max for γ-P-ATP of
2.8± 1.0 nmol L−1 day−1, and K m at 11.5± 5.4 nmol L−1 (n = 6). The NPB contribution to
γ-P-ATP uptake was high (95± 3%, n = 4) at ambient concentrations but decreased to
∼50% at the highest ATP amendment. PRO had K m values 5–10 times greater than NPB.
The above indicates that PRO and NPB were in close competition in terms of Pi acquisition,
whereas P uptake from ATP could be attributed to NPB.This apparent resource partitioning
may be a niche separating strategy and an important factor in the successful co-existence
within the oligotrophic upper ocean of the NPSG.

INTRODUCTION
Phosphorus (P) is a major bioelement required for all life, and is
frequently in low, or limiting supply relative to biological demand
in aquatic ecosystems (Krom et al., 1991; Cotner et al., 1997; Wu
et al., 2000; Moutin et al., 2005; Thingstad et al., 2005). In the
North Paciﬁc Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), however, primary pro-
duction has long been viewed as being controlled by the availability
of nitrogen (N: Eppley et al., 1973; Codispoti, 1989). Never-
theless, it has been hypothesized that natural, climate induced
changes have exerted selective pressure on the microorganisms
in the NPSG, favoring small, non-eukaryotic phototrophs, such as
Prochlorococcus (PRO) and Synechococcus (SYN), as well as dis-
solved nitrogen gas (N2)-ﬁxing organisms (Karl et al., 1992, 1997;
Karl, 1999), the latter which potentially may relieve the system of
N-limitation. The presence and activity of N2-ﬁxing organisms,
such as Trichodesmium sp., Crocosphaera sp., or symbiotic relation-
ships between diatoms and N2-ﬁxing symbionts such as Richelia

sp., have been well documented over the past decade at Station
ALOHA, and elsewhere in the NPSG, as have their important role
in providing new N to the upper euphotic zone, and contribution
to export production (Villareal, 1991; Karl et al., 1992, 2002, 2012;
Letelier and Karl, 1996; Zehr et al., 2001; Church et al., 2005a,b). A
supply mechanism for“new”P, analogous to that of N2-ﬁxation for
N, does not exist, and resupply of P into the euphotic zone is pre-
dominantly restricted to inﬂux of nutrient enriched deeper waters.
Although atmospheric deposition does occur, it contributes only
minimally to new P as the N to P ratio is much higher than the
canonical Redﬁeld stoichiometry of 16:1 (Redﬁeld et al., 1963; Gra-
ham and Duce, 1979; Paerl, 1993; Chadwick et al., 1999). Hence,
over long time scales, these constraints on new P delivery into the
productive layers of the upper ocean, together with increased N2-
ﬁxation, are expected to drive these marine ecosystems toward P
limitation (Falkowski, 1997). Indeed, concomitant to the rise in
N2-ﬁxation and presumable increased inventories of bioavailable

Microbial P uptake kinetics

N, the decadal trends in the dissolved inorganic P (Pi) and par-
ticulate P (PP) inventories (0–100 m) at Station ALOHA show
large drawdown in both, with ∼70% lower Pi and ∼50% lower PP
than at the beginning of the Hawaii Ocean Times-series (HOT)
program in 1988 (Karl, 2007). Based on these N and P trends, it
has been hypothesized that intensiﬁcation in the cycling of P will
occur in this region, as well as increased utilization of the much
larger dissolved organic P (DOP) pool (Karl et al., 1997; Karl and
Björkman, 2002).

Marine microorganisms, such as PRO and non-chlorophyll
ﬂuorescent picoplankton cells (hereafter called non-pigmented
bacteria; NPB), are osmotrophic and rely on a mixture of dissolved
inorganic and organic P compounds to support their nutritional
needs (Thingstad et al., 1993). These two groups may be in direct
competition, as well as with larger pico- and nano-phytoplankton,
when essential resources are in short supply. In addition, the rel-
ative success of the speciﬁc groups of microorganisms may be
related to their kinetic response characteristics, and small cells
are typically believed to be at a competitive advantage over larger
cells due to their greater surface to volume ratios. Nutrient uptake
kinetic theory has often been used to assess potential nutrient
stress or limitation in a given environment, but can also be applied
to investigate the relative competitiveness among microbial groups
(Perry, 1976; Donald et al., 1997). For example, the success of PRO
in the NPSG may well be related to the perennially oligotrophic
conditions of this environment, where larger cells rarely experi-
ence high enough nutrient ﬁelds to reach their maximum uptake
velocity,V max, and therefore may be at a competitive disadvantage.
Hence the kinetic response by microorganisms to nutrient pulses,
their ability to cope at perennially low concentrations, or their
potential for utilizing organically bound nutrients, may determine
the relative competitiveness and ultimate success of various micro-
bial taxa, and thus the composition of the microbial community.
The partitioning of P among the main groups of microorgan-
isms is yet poorly characterized, therefore, identiﬁcation of the
competitive ability in P utilization among different osmotrophs is
necessary for the prediction of changes in species composition in
microbial communities, in the functioning of the microbial sys-
tem and in the microbially mediated degradation of organic matter
(Thingstad et al., 1993; Tanaka and Rassoulzadegan, 2003).

Recently, ﬂow cytometric cell sorting of targeted groups of
microorganisms, such as PRO, SYN, and NBP, combined with
radiotracer techniques has been used to investigate the speciﬁc
utilization and uptake rates of both Pi (Larsen et al., 2008; Casey
et al., 2009; Duhamel et al., in revision), and in a few studies,
(cid:2)
select DOP compounds, in the form of adenosine-5
-triphosphate
(ATP; Løvdal et al., 2007; Casey et al., 2009; Michelou et al., 2011).
These studies have revealed differences in P partitioning between
the selected microbial groups, and sampling sites with respect to
both Pi and ATP acquisition rates, although the reasons for the
differences between similar groups remain unclear.

In addition, cell sorting to elucidate P dynamics on the group
speciﬁc level has yet to be applied in the NPSG and, to our knowl-
edge, no information exists on the kinetic response to increased
substrate concentrations.

It is therefore of interest to gain a better understanding of
the utilization of both inorganic and organic forms of P by

microorganisms in oligotrophic marine environments, such as
the NPSG. In addition, the competition for potentially limit-
ing resources between phototrophic and heterotrophic plankton
groups is poorly resolved (Thingstad et al., 1998; Tanaka et al.,
2004), and in the NPSG, these interactions are predominantly
occurring within the domain Bacteria with PRO being the dom-
inant phototrophic organism (Campbell and Vaulot, 1993). Here
we present P uptake kinetics in whole water samples collected
over several years in the NPSG near Hawaii, containing the mixed
microbial biota. The primary objective in the initial set of experi-
ments (2002–2009) was to investigate the P dynamics and kinetic
response to the addition of increasing Pi concentrations, in both
whole water and different size classes of the microbial community.
In 2010, the added capability of ﬂow sorting radiolabeled cells at
sea was used to assess the relative response of two microbial groups
as characterized by their size and pigmentation (PRO and NPB),
to both Pi and organic phosphorus, here ATP.

We discuss the implications of the observed P uptake dynamics
and kinetic response to P loading, with respect to P acquisition
of different microbial size classes, or ﬂow sorted groups. We also
assess the case for resource partitioning between PRO and the NPB
as revealed by group speciﬁc utilization of Pi versus ATP.

HYDROGRAPHY DATA
In addition to the parameters measured with the environmen-
tal sensors, discrete seawater samples were also collected. These
included samples for Pi and chlorophyll a (chl a). The sample
collections and analyses were all according to the HOT stan-
dard protocols (hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/). In brief,
for chl a determination, 150 mL of seawater was typically ﬁl-
tered through a glass ﬁber ﬁlter (GF/F; Whatman), and the ﬁlter
placed into test tubes containing 5 mL of 100% acetone. The sam-
ples were extracted for 5–7 days at −20˚C in the dark prior to
ﬂuorometric analysis (Turner Designs; model 10-AU). Samples
for ambient nutrient concentrations were collected into high-
density polyethylene bottles, stored upright and frozen (−20˚C)
until analyzed in the shore-based laboratory (Dore et al., 1996).
In addition, samples for Pi analyses were collected from each
experimental Pi amendment. The Pi concentrations were mea-
sured using the MAGnesium Induced Co-precipitation technique
(MAGIC: Karl and Tien, 1992), followed by standard colorimetric

INCUBATION CONDITIONS AND P AMENDMENT
Seawater for investigating the P uptake kinetics was collected
from water depths between 25 and 45 m and always sampled
within the mixed layer. After P amendment, the samples were
incubated in on-deck incubators, cooled with running, surface
seawater and shielded with blue plexiglass (Rohm-Haas #2069)
to achieve the approximate light level and spectral quality of the
sample depth. The incubations were carried out in acid-washed,
distilled water and sample-rinsed, clear polycarbonate (PC) bot-
tles (Nalgene: 250 mL 2002–2009, 75 mL 2010) and amended with

Microbial P uptake kinetics

measured in seawater and there is prior knowledge about its pool
size in the NPSG (Björkman and Karl, 2001). For Pi uptake exper-
iments, the samples were spiked with radiolabeled P in the form
of 32P-orthophosphate (MP Biomedicals #064014L, carrier free).
In experiments investigating ATP uptake rates and pool turnover,
either ATP labeled in the gamma (γ) position with 32P, or with
tritium on the purine base was used (MP Biomedicals #0124009;
−1, #013502; γ-32P-

However, in experiments designed for cell sorting by ﬂow cytome-

magnitude in the upper water column (observed range at Station
ALOHA: 0.06–0.21 nmol ATP L

−1; Björkman and Karl, 2001).

For experiments conducted during the years 2002–2009 the
incubation bottles were subsampled three to four times during
a 6–8 h incubation period. In 2010 the sampling was conducted
using end point ﬁltrations only. To assess the incorporation of
radioactivity into the particulate fraction 10–50 mL aliquots were
routinely ﬁltered onto polycarbonate (PC) membrane ﬁlters. The
ﬁlters were rinsed 3 times with 5 mL each of ﬁltered seawater and
placed into scintillation vials. Scintillation cocktail (Ultima Gold
LLT, Perkin Elmer) was added to each vial and the radioactiv-
ity counted on a Packard liquid scintillation counter (TriCarb
2770TR/LT), and quench corrected by using the internal SIE
protocol.

SIZE FRACTIONATION AND CELL SORTING
Size fractionation of the microbial community was performed
by ﬁltering the whole water samples through PC membrane ﬁl-
ters of different pore sizes. Typically these included the >2 and
>0.2 μm size classes. In the later cruises in 2010, a third size cat-
egory (>0.6 μm) was included to attempt to separate the NPB
and PRO cells from the slightly larger sized SYN component. The
size classes 0.2–0.6 and 0.6–2 μm were derived by the difference in
particulate activity between the 0.2 and 0.6 μm, and the 0.6 and
2 μm ﬁlters respectively.

On the two cruises in 2010 (KM1013, KM1016) we used a
Cytopeia Inﬂux Mariner ﬂow cytometer to sort radiolabeled cells
into ﬂow cytometrically deﬁned microbial groups. The Inﬂux was
equipped with two lasers (448 and 457 nm) that were both focused
through the same pinhole. This conﬁguration improved the res-
olution of PRO populations from background noise in the upper
water column, an important improvement. PRO cells frequently
have very low chl ﬂuorescence at the near-surface depths sampled
and may otherwise have been undetectable in unstained sam-
ples, and may hence be mistaken for NPB in stained samples.
Sheath ﬂuid solution (BioSure cat. #1020) was diluted 16× with
de-ionized water and ﬁltered through a 0.2 μm PC membrane
ﬁlter prior to use. Samples were analyzed live as soon after collec-
tion as possible, but typically within 8 h. To minimize continued

uptake of Pi the samples were chased with non-radiolabeled Pi to
−1 P. In incubations where
a ﬁnal concentration of ∼100 μmol L
ATP had been the substrate, ATP was used as the cold chase to a
−1 P. The reason not to use a
ﬁnal concentration of ∼100 μmol L
preservative was that large, rapid initial losses of the radiolabeled
−1
material from the cells have been observed for 32Pi (∼15% h
over 3 h, stabilizing after 6 h at ∼70% loss; data not shown). This
loss is possibly due to increased permeability of the cell mem-
branes upon preservation with paraformaldehyde and subsequent
loss of low molecular weight compounds. Our observations of
these losses are much larger than previously recorded (Larsen
et al., 2008; Michelou et al., 2011) and is expected to vary with
growth rates, biosynthesis and other properties. The cold chased
samples may also lose activity over time, as the result of recycling
and isotope dilution effects, however, our limited dataset indicated
no signiﬁcant loss over 3 h, which is consistent with results from
Talarmin et al. (2011). Two populations were ﬂow sorted; PRO and
NPB. The PRO population was deﬁned by its forward scatter and
chl-based red (692/40 nm) ﬂuorescence characteristics, and fur-
ther distinguished from SYN by its relative lack of a phycoerythrin
signal (orange ﬂuorescence). The NPB population was visualized
by staining with SYBR Green I (Invitrogen; 1X ﬁnal concentration,
−1 of sample). These samples were allowed to stain for a
5 μL mL
minimum of 30 min. This longer staining time has been found
to give good results with unpreserved samples (Talarmin et al.,
2011). All samples were amended with ﬂuorescent, spherical ref-
erence beads (1 μm, Fluoresbrite), to maintain proper alignment
and focus of the instrument. Because the PRO population can-
not be uniquely distinguished in the SYBR stained samples in the
upper water column, the NPB cell numbers were determined as
the difference between PRO in unstained samples and the total cell
numbers of the stained sample. The Inﬂux data acquisition used
the Spigot software (Cytopeia), and cell numbers for each PRO
and NPB were determined using the FlowJo software (Tree Star
Inc.). Microbial biomass estimates were based on the measured
−1 for
cell abundances multiplied by 10 fg C cell
NPB and PRO respectively (Christian and Karl, 1994; Zubkov et al.,
1998). Approximately 25,000–100,000 cells were sorted per sample
depending on experiment and cell type, to achieve sufﬁcient signal.
Two sort streams were simultaneously collected directly into sepa-
rate 7 mL plastic scintillation vials (Simport). The primary stream
contained the microbial cells selected and the second the reference
beads. The second vial containing the beads was used to account
for radioactivity in the small volume of seawater associated with
the sorted cells and was subtracted from the radioactivity obtained
from the cells themselves. The radioactivity per cell was calculated
−1 to obtain the Pi or ATP
and multiplied by the number of cells L
turnover or uptake rate. This assumes that the cells sorted con-
stitute a representative subsample of the whole target population,
even though a range of activities are likely to occur within a given
group of microorganisms.

of radiolabel uptake into the particulate fraction (Bq L
In time course experiments this rate was determined from lin-
ear regression of the incubation time and radioactivity of the
ﬁlters. This calculation assumes that the speciﬁc activity of the
substrate pool is constant during the incubation period. In our
experiments <10% of the radiolabel was taken up during the
incubation time, with the exception of the unamended control
samples from OPEREX stations 15 and 36, where 31 and 70% was
incorporated, respectively. At such high proportions of the radio-
label taken up, the calculated uptake rate will be biased as recycling
of the pool is likely to have occurred, and may lead to underesti-
mates of the actual rate of uptake. The rate of Pi or ATP uptake,

concentration of 0.2 nmol L
seawater, based on previous, direct measurements of dissolved
ATP within the same region of the NPSG by Björkman and Karl
(2001). They reported mean summer time concentrations of dis-
solved ATP at 25 m at Station ALOHA of 0.17± 0.02 nmol L

where S = substrate concentration, V = substrate uptake velocity
and S/V = Tt of the P-pool. Note that the Tt was determined inde-
pendently of S (see above). By plotting S against S/V the kinetic
parameters K m and V max can be derived from the linear regres-
sion where the slope= 1/V max and the intercept= V max/K m. The

biomass differences among experiments in the V max parameter

is acknowledged that chl a is not the ideal biomass indicator as
non-photosynthetic microorganisms also utilize P and clearly will
not be included.

(HOT 142, 153) prior to the winter mixing of the upper water
column (Table 1).

The population structure in terms of cell numbers for PRO,
SYN, picoeukaryotes (PEUK), and NPB varied little over the
2007–2010 period (Table 2). PRO cell numbers ranged from
1.70× 108 to 2.84× 108 cells L
−1, with an average abundance of
2.01± 0.42× 108 cells L
−1 (n = 16) and PRO was the dominant
group of chl a containing cells (>98% by numbers; the con-
tribution of PRO to phototrophic biomass has been found to
be >70% within the mixed layer; Campbell et al., 1994). SYN
and PEUK population numbers were within the climatology for
Station ALOHA at 1.1± 0.4× 106 and 0.7± 0.2× 106 cells L
−1
respectively, with a combined contribution of <0.5% of the total
cell numbers (n = 11, data not shown). The NPB cell abundance
ranged from 4.03× 108 to 5.93× 108 cells L
−1, with an average
of 5.17± 0.71× 108 cells L
−1. The relative contribution of PRO
ranged from 23.2 to 36.5%, and NPB 63.5 to 76.6% (mean
27.8± 3.5%; 72.0± 3.4%; n = 16, respectively) of the total ﬂow
cytometry cell counts. The biomass contribution, derived from the
−1 for PRO and 4.0–
cell abundances, ranged from 4.0 to 8.5 μg C L
−1; 5.2± 0.7; n = 16,
−1 for NPB (mean 6.0± 1.2 μg C L
6.3 μg C L
respectively) with an average relative contribution by PRO of
51.7± 4.1% and NPB 44.6± 4.0% (Table 2), the remaining 3–
4% of the biomass being SYN and PEUK. The cell numbers and
biomass observed during this study were all within the climatology
of Station ALOHA for these microbial groups (Table 2).

PHOSPHORUS TURNOVER TIME AND UPTAKE RATE AT AMBIENT
CONCENTRATIONS
The Tt of the Pi pool ranged from 0.4 to 34 days, with a median of
12.5 days and mean of 14± 10 days (n = 19; Table 3). The short-
est turnover times were associated with the cyclonic eddy during
the OPEREX cruise. The measured Pi pool concentrations versus
the calculated Pi uptake rates showed no correlation (r 2 < 0.000;
p > 0.05; n = 19; Figure 2A), whereas Tt and the ambient concen-
tration of Pi showed a signiﬁcant, positive relationship (r 2 = 0.675;
p < 0.001; n = 19; Figure 2B). The Tt in the >2 μm fraction was
always much longer than for the smaller fractions (0.2–2 μm, or
0.6–2 μm; Table 3) reﬂecting their smaller contribution to the
microbial biomass, and ranged from ∼16 to 300 days. The uptake
into the >2 μm size fraction as a proportion of the total, was
also typically small (mean 13.1± 7.3%, n = 15), but contributed
more in areas where blooms were observed (e.g., BLOOMER sta-
tion 20: 29.7%, KM1016, station 5: 23.7%: Figure 3). Within the
cyclonic eddy feature the >2 μm fraction represented <3% of the
total community Pi uptake (Figure 3). During cruises conducted
in 2010, when a smaller pore size ﬁlter (0.6 μm, PC) was also
included, Pi taken up into the smallest (0.2–0.6 μm) fraction still
dominated the Pi assimilation and averaged 62.8± 3.4% (n = 5;
Figure 4A). Pi uptake rates by the whole water microbial commu-

nity ranged from 0.8 to 7.9 nmol L

The Tt of the γ-32P-ATP pool ranged from 3.3 to 5.7 days (mean
4.5± 0.8 days; n = 6) and was approximately three to seven times
faster than the corresponding Tt for the Pi pool (Table 3). How-
ever, the Tt for 3H-ATP ranged from 15 to 62 days and was as long
or longer than that of the Pi pool and 5–10 times longer than the Tt
of the γ-P of ATP (Table 3). Note, however, that the relatively low

speciﬁc activity of the 3H-ATP tracer, resulting in nmolar addi-
tions of ATP in these experiments, could well have affected the Tt,
and most likely did affect the rates in the “zero” addition incuba-
tion. This potential biasing effect would diminish with increasing
concentrations. Hence, the rates calculated for ambient concen-
trations are in all likelihood overestimates of the unamended rate.
The calculated rates of ATP uptake were still low, reﬂecting the low
concentrations of the ambient pool and measured in the pmolar
range with γ-P-ATP uptake in the whole water community of
44.4± 10.9 pmol L

rate observed for γ-P-ATP with a range in uptake rate from

low for γ-P-ATP at 3.5± 2.5% of the total community uptake,
whereas 83.5± 8.8% could be attributed to microorganisms in
the 0.2–0.6 μm size class (Table 3; Figure 4C). In comparison,
14.5± 10.4% of the 3H-ATP uptake was by the >2 μm microor-
ganisms and 73.1± 8.5% was by the smallest size class (Table 3;

making the determination of the K m parameter unreliable, as

(mean 8.2± 3.7 and 90± 40 respectively, n = 19; Table 4). The
lowest K m values measured were in the cyclonic eddy sampled
during OPEREX (stations 15 and 36), and were most likely due
to the very low ambient Pi concentrations, which made it possible
to resolve changes in uptake rates to relatively small increases in
Pi concentration. Likewise the ambient Pi concentrations during
HOT 142 and 153 were below the upper ocean long-term mean for
Pi at Station ALOHA, and the addition of Pi resulted in increased
uptake rates (Figures 5, and 6A). Yet, in other experiments (e.g.,
HOT 138, 139 and KM1016-2 and KM1016-3) the ambient Pi con-
centrations were above the long-term mean, and the rate responses
were small and variable (Figure 5). Nevertheless, the V max data,
although widely variable among experiments, were signiﬁcantly
higher (paired t -test, n = 19) than the measured rates at ambient
concentrations, and Pi uptake rates in the unamended incubations
were on average 61± 17% (n = 19) of V max. In addition, the Pi

the highest Pi amendment (+150 nmol Pi L
−1), and were signiﬁ-
cantly greater than the rates at ambient concentrations (one-way
ANOVA, p = 0.02; df 27). The increase was predominantly the
result of higher uptake rates in the largest (>2 μm) size class
(Figures 3 and 4B) which increased approximately threefold, to
an average contribution of 30± 17% (n = 15; Figure 3) of the
total uptake. There were two notable exceptions; OPEREX sta-
tions 15 and 36 within the cyclonic eddy, where the Pi uptake rate
−1
in the >2 μm size class was ∼25 times higher at the 150 nmol L
Pi addition, than at ambient concentrations, and contributed to
61 and 42% of the total Pi uptake respectively (Figure 3). The
uptake rate of the 0.2–2 μm size class was not statistically dif-
ferent from rates at ambient Pi concentrations, whereas the Pi
uptake rate in the >2 μm class was (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.004,

df 27). The response to increased concentrations of ATP on
uptake of either the γ-P of ATP or the 3H-labeled purine, sig-
niﬁcantly increased the rate of uptake at all concentrations added,
and could reach >70 times (mean 44± 17; n = 11) of the ini-
tial rate at the highest concentrations tested (Figures 4D,F and
6C,E). The relative rate increase was not different between the
two differently labeled ATP. The greatest relative increase was
observed in the largest size class, however, the contribution from
the >2 μm cells was highly variable and ranged from 3 to 43%
of the total rate (mean 12.5± 11.9; n = 11). In the three exper-
iments where Pi and the two ATP sources were tested simulta-
neously (KM1013-1, -2, and KM1016-2-3) the contribution by
the >2 μm size class increased by the same relative factor from
ambient to the highest concentration tested. Furthermore, whereas

the same type of kinetics, and typically did not appear to sat-
urate even at the highest tested ATP amendment (Figure 6E).
Hence, kinetic parameters were calculated for only two 3H-ATP
experiments (KM1013-1, -2), but for all six γ-P-ATP experi-
ments (Table 4; Figure 6C). In contrast to Pi kinetics, the γ-P
uptake at ambient concentrations was only a small fraction (2–

GROUP AND CELL SPECIFIC UPTAKE AND KINETIC OF Pi AND ATP
Uptake of Pi and ATP into group speciﬁc compartments, using
ﬂow cytometric cell sorting, was investigated on selected samples
from experiments conducted in the summer of 2010 (KM1013
and KM1016). The Pi uptake by PRO, at ambient concentrations,

and the Pi uptake rate ranged from 5.4 to 20.1 amol cell

PRO or NPB, and the data are insufﬁcient for any conclusive state-
ment (Table 5). In contrast to Pi, the uptake of the γ-P of ATP
was almost exclusively by the NPB with an average contribution
to the total uptake of 95± 3% (n = 4) and PRO showed higher
K m values than did NPB (Table 5, Figure 6D). The mean per cell

uptake of γ-P of ATP ranged from 0.024 to 0.109 amol L

uptake of 3H-ATP also showed dominance by the NPB popula-
tion, although the rates were lower than those observed for γ-P by
∼75% (Table 5, Figure 6F).

DISCUSSION
The NPSG is characterized by its perennially stratiﬁed conditions
and prevailing low nutrient concentrations within the euphotic
zone (Mann and Lazier, 1991). Within this ecosystem nutrients,
and particularly P, are intensely recycled, although the ﬂux rates
among biogeochemical compartments are still poorly constrained.
The dynamics of P uptake and turnover of the Pi pool have been
studied for some time within oligotrophic gyre environments
(Perry and Eppley, 1981; Sorokin, 1985; Björkman et al., 2000;
Duhamel et al., 2011). However, these studies have revealed great
variability in rates, e.g., the Tt appear to be shorter today (∼days
to weeks), than reported in the 1980s (weeks to months), possi-
bly reﬂecting changes in P inventories, or diminishing supplies of
bioavailable P. Indeed, the presence of alkaline phosphatase activ-
ity (Perry, 1976; Duhamel et al., 2010, 2011), C:P and N:P ratios of
the particulate pools (Hebel and Karl, 2001; Karl et al., 2001) indi-
cate an ecosystem where P is in relatively short supply. The high
variability in the upper ocean Pi concentrations observed in this

study (3–110 nmol L

heterogeneity in the near-surface Pi inventories. This is not atyp-
ical for this region, and the NPSG has been shown to be a much
more dynamic system in biogeochemical parameters than previ-
ously assumed (Karl and Lukas, 1996; Karl, 1999; Corno et al., 2007;
Calil and Richards, 2010), but emphasizes the variable nutrient
ﬁelds the microbial community experiences over relatively short
time scales. The potential bioavailability of dissolved organic P
(DOP), which pool size typically is much larger than that of Pi
in the NPSG (Karl et al., 1997; Karl and Björkman, 2002), should
constitute a nutritional buffer to the microbial community. How-
ever, the bioavailability of DOP is less well documented, but there
is evidence that select compounds groups, such as nucleotides, are
available on short time scales (Azam and Hodson, 1977; Ammer-
man and Azam, 1985, 1991; Björkman and Karl, 1994; Björkman
et al., 2000; Løvdal et al., 2007) although Pi appears to be the most
readily bioavailable form of P (Cembella et al., 1984; Cotner and
Wetzel, 1992). Nevertheless, it has been shown that DOP can sup-
ply up to half of the P taken up by microorganisms in the NPSG,
but on time scales of hours to days, this P utilization may con-
stitute only a minor (1–5%) fraction of the potentially available
DOP pool (Björkman and Karl, 2003).

Pi AND ATP UPTAKE IN WHOLE WATER, AND SIZE FRACTIONATED
MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES
In this study, the Tt of the P-pool for the whole water microbial
community appeared to correlate with Pi concentrations, whereas

the Pi uptake rates were not correlated to the size of the ambient Pi
pool. This may indicate that overall Pi requirements of the extant
community often were met at the prevailing Pi inventories in the
upper water column in the NPSG. In addition, turnover times of
the P-pool were typically in the order of a week to weeks in all but
a few experiments (Tt of ∼0.5 days) that coincided with unusually
low concentrations of ambient Pi. Hence, it follows that in the
majority of our experiments the kinetic response to increased Pi
amendments of the extant whole water community was muted,
and the microorganisms were most likely not proximately con-
trolled by Pi availability. The conclusion that the NPSG is not
currently under P limitation has been drawn from other investi-
gations on P dynamics in the NPSG (Björkman et al., 2000; Van
Mooy and Devol, 2008; Duhamel et al., 2011). However, the calcu-
lated V max parameter was always higher than the observed uptake
rates at ambient Pi concentrations, and the response was predomi-
nantly driven by increased uptake by the largest size class (>2 μm)
tested. This may indicate that although the whole water microbial
community does not appear to be limited by Pi availability, the
larger celled members may be at a competitive disadvantage at the
prevailingly low Pi concentrations. Additionally, we observed sup-
pressed rates at ambient Pi concentration, and increased uptake
rate with Pi additions (e.g., HOT 142, 153, KM1016-5), when
the ambient concentrations of Pi were well below the long-term
mean for Station ALOHA (0–25 m; 58± 3 and 38± 8 nmol L

1999–2009). In contrast, we did not observe suppressed rates
within the cyclonic eddy during the OPEREX cruise. This fea-
ture had exceedingly low Pi concentrations and turnover times of
less than a day, but rates were as high as at stations with much
higher Pi concentrations. These stations also had elevated AP
activities relative to other stations outside of the eddy (Duhamel,
personal communication). The latter has also been observed in
the NPSG correlating with low Pi concentration (Duhamel et al.,
2010). Another difference shared among these stations was that

the Pi uptake by >2 μm plankton contributed a smaller frac-
tion than in other experiments, and this group may have been
unable to compete for Pi under the extant conditions. Neverthe-
less, the response in this size class to Pi additions were among
the highest observed here, together with OPEREX station 26, and
KM1016-5-8 (Figure 3). The OPEREX station 26 was located in
the frontal zone between the cyclonic feature and an anti-cyclonic
eddy, and was associated with elevated particulate material and
concentrations of chl a. This observed increase in biomass has been

cells’ higher capacity for rapid uptake of Pi at high concentrations
(Rhee, 1972), but also, their relatively higher K m will make them
less competitive with both phototrophic and heterotrophic bacte-
ria under the typically oligotrophic conditions in the NPSG. Perry
(1976) conducted pioneering work in the NPSG with regard to P
dynamics and kinetic response to P amendments. She found V max
−1, which is very similar to
values of ∼80 mmol P L
the chl a normalized V max for Pi uptake that we found. However,
our calculated K m was typically substantially lower (mean of ∼40
−1), possibly due to the lower P additions (+10
versus 180 nmol L
−1 versus 0.1 to 5 μmol P L
−1) used in our ﬁeld
to 150 nmol P L
experiments, but could also reﬂect differences in the microbial
community composition.

attributed to physical forcing within this area, resulting primarily
in particle accumulation, and possibly higher production rates. At
KM1016-4 and -5 there were phytoplankton blooms in progress
manifested in high chl a, and also in increased rates of primary and
bacterial production (data not shown). These dynamics point to
situations where Pi inventories could be drawn down to concen-
trations where only the smallest components of the community
are at a competitive advantage, as observed in other P-limited sys-
tems such as the Mediterranean Sea (Van Wambeke et al., 2002;
Moutin et al., 2005; Thingstad et al., 2005).

However, in these oligotrophic systems the effective competi-
tion for P is most likely within the domain Bacteria, and in the
NPSG the <2 μm size class will contain the dominant photosyn-
thesizers, both in terms of numerical abundance and biomass,
Prochlorococcus sp., as well as the second most abundant Syne-
chococcus sp. (Campbell and Vaulot, 1993; Campbell et al., 1994,
1997). Synechococcus abundance and biomass in the NPSG is
however very low (<0.1% of total bacterial cell numbers, <1%
of the microbial biomass). We did ﬁnd that the 0.2–2 μm size
class always dominated Pi uptake, both at ambient and amended
concentrations, but the response in Pi uptake rate was not sig-
niﬁcantly different between the ambient and the highest tested
addition. However, the >2 μm size class increased their uptake
rates signiﬁcantly more in response to high Pi, and their relative
contribution to the total Pi uptake also increased. This response
may be interpreted as a form of luxury uptake, and possibly the
potential of these larger cells to rapidly capitalize on high concen-
tration nutrient pulses, an ability the smaller microbial cells may
lack. In addition, larger cells have been shown to take up more P,
and have higher primary production, than their contribution to
the chlorophyll inventory would imply (Li et al., 2011; Mahaffey et
al., 2012) and, as shown here, contributes progressively more the
higher the P concentration. This could well be related to the larger

-nucleotidase (5

Uptake of ATP is most likely mediated by the bacterial
ectoenzyme 5
Nase) that recognizes the purine
or pyrimidine bases of nucleotides. This enzyme sequentially
hydrolyzes all the three phosphate groups of ATP, a mechanism
that appears to be requisite for the subsequent uptake of either the
Pi or nucleoside components (Bengis-Garber and Kushner, 1982).
Several studies have attributed the hydrolysis of ATP in marine
environments to 5
Nase (Ammerman and Azam, 1985; Björkman
and Karl, 1994) and it has been proposed that this activity alone
can sustain bacterial P-requirements (Tamminen, 1989; Ammer-
man, 1991). In addition, 5
Nase activity often results in substantial
regeneration of Pi released into the surrounding waters (Tam-
minen, 1989; Björkman and Karl, 1994; Siuda and Güde, 1994)
possibly indicating a preference for the nucleoside over the Pi by
these bacteria. AP can also hydrolyze ATP, and the measurement of
AP activity is often used to assess P stress or limitation in marine
microorganisms (Dyhrman and Ruttenberg, 2006; Van Wambeke
et al., 2008; Duhamel et al., 2010). AP activity has been observed
in the NPSG but rates are typically low relative to what would be
expected in P-limited environments (Perry, 1972; Duhamel et al.,
2011). Duhamel et al. (2011), estimated that AP activity would
only regenerate a couple of percent of Pi to the extant pool. Nev-
ertheless, if the Pi derived from AP activity was all taken up, this
source could provide up to ∼40% of the net P uptake at Station
ALOHA. Here we observed a more rapid turnover of the ATP pool
relative to the Pi pool by approximately a factor of ﬁve. This recon-
ﬁrms that ATP, although only a small fraction of the total DOP,
is preferentially utilized by the microbial community. Björkman
and Karl (2005), using 3H-ATP, estimated that the ﬂux through
this P-pool could be ﬁve times faster than that of the bulk DOP
−1
pool. They showed K m values ranging from 1 to 26 nmol L
−1 at their lowest concentra-
and V max of 0.3–1.4 nmol L
−1). Finally, they reported what appeared to
tions (0.2–57 nmol L
be multiphasic uptake of ATP, with potentially much higher V max
rates and K m values at high ATP concentrations (Björkman and
Karl, 2005), a phenomenon also observed for the microbial utiliza-
tion of glucose (Azam and Hodson, 1981). Multiphasic kinetics
are to be expected with mixed microbial assemblages, which most
likely possess different metabolic traits and nutrient uptake poten-
tials. The ATP uptake rates, as well as the kinetic parameters found
here, are similar to those presented by Björkman and Karl (2005).
In a study conducted in the Sargasso Sea, ATP uptake rates
−1 were reported (Casey
ranging from 120 to 960 pmol L
et al., 2009). However, they based their calculation on an assumed

ATP pool size of 1 nmol L
concentration adopted in this study, based on previous, direct mea-
surement within the NPSG. If taking this difference into account,
our rates are comparable to those observed from the North Atlantic
subtropical gyre. Casey et al. (2009) also reported Pi uptake rates
that were similar to those measured in this study, as well as rates
three to four times higher. This could be a result of the dominance

of PRO in the NPSG versus the much greater proportion of SYN
found in the Sargasso Sea, with the higher rates possibly driven by
SYN.

In addition, we observed a difference in Tt at ambient concen-
trations between Pi and ATP in the smallest size class (0.2–0.6 μm)
compared to the largest (>2 μm). The relative difference in P

fourfold greater for γ-P-ATP than Pi (e.g., KM1013; Tables 3 and
4). This could indicate that uptake into the larger size class was
not by the direct hydrolysis of ATP, but uptake of Pi regener-
ated from ATP and mixed into the ambient Pi pool. Furthermore,
we observed that the turnover time of 3H-ATP was substan-
tially longer than that of γ-P-ATP in all size classes, and that
the calculated uptake rates at ambient concentrations were about
twice as high for γ-P-ATP. This may also indicate that ATP must
be hydrolyzed before becoming generally available and could
also be related to differential uptake of the P versus the purine
moiety. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the 3H in 2,8-
position of ATP may exchange during metabolic processes and

be partially lost as 3H2O. We did not take this into account in our
calculations.

GROUP AND CELL SPECIFIC UPTAKE AND UTILIZATION OF Pi AND ATP
In recent years the application of sorting radiolabeled microbial
cells by ﬂow cytometry has lead to new insights into group speciﬁc
uptake and utilization of compounds such as different amino acids
(Zubkov et al., 2004; Michelou et al., 2007; Mary et al., 2008), as
well as Pi and ATP (Larsen et al., 2008; Casey et al., 2009; Michelou
et al., 2011).

In the oligotrophic Sargasso Sea, Casey et al. (2009) showed
that SYN and PRO were superior to larger chl pigmented cells in

acquiring P from both Pi and ATP. They concluded that SYN and
PRO were about equally competitive for Pi, whereas P derived from
ATP was always less than Pi for PRO (approximately by a factor
of 2–10). Michelou et al. (2011), in a study conducted at the same
time and place as Casey et al. (2009), focused on the relative uptake
of Pi and ATP by PRO and heterotrophic bacteria (equivalent
to our NPB population). They found that heterotrophic bacte-
ria dominated the Pi uptake on a community basis, but had an
approximately equal per cell rate of uptake as PRO. Our data dif-
fer from this in that PRO per cell rates exceeded those of the NPB
population by approximately threefold. These divergent results
may reside in the relative biomass difference between PRO and
NPB (here a factor 3:1 PRO:NPB), and therefore a higher require-
ment of P for balanced growth in PRO, or in the ability of PRO
to substitute sulfur for P in its membrane lipids, a phenomenon
that seems to be more pronounced during P stress (Van Mooy
et al., 2009) and hence may be more prevalent under ultra-low P
conditions found in the North Atlantic. Additionally, the observed
differences between experiments conducted in the NPSG and the
Sargasso Sea could also have originated from the experimental
designs employed. We incubated our samples at the light level
from which the samples had been collected, whereas both stud-
ies in the Sargasso Sea (Casey et al., 2009; Michelou et al., 2011)
incubated their samples in the dark. It has been shown that light
enhances the uptake of amino acids in PRO (Michelou et al., 2007)
and more recently, Duhamel et al. (in review) report that Pi uptake
in PRO also is enhanced by light.

Our results with respect to group speciﬁc utilization of ATP
suggest that PRO is not competitive relative to NPB at any concen-
tration tested, and ATP hydrolysis and subsequent P acquisition
by NPB appeared tightly coupled. Although, in culture experi-
ments, various strains of PRO have been shown to be able to
fulﬁll their P-requirements using ATP as the sole source of P
(Moore et al., 2005), and may still have the requisite enzymes
for nucleotide hydrolysis. Furthermore, the substantially shorter
Tt for γ-P than for Pi in experiments where a direct cross compar-
ison could be made (e.g., KM1016-2-3), imply that ATP utilization
and uptake of γ-P appear to occur independently from the uptake
of Pi. This is consistent with the activities of 5
Nase, an enzyme
known not to be inhibited by Pi (Bengis-Garber and Kushner,
1981, 1982; Ammerman and Azam, 1985). These results indi-
cate that utilization of ATP appears to be mediated primarily
by the NPB and again suggest that the uptake of the γ-P by
the larger size classes may be the result of the γ-P released and
mixed with the ambient Pi pool prior to uptake. Whereas the
uptake of ATP could almost exclusively be attributed to the NPB
population in the NPSG, no statistical difference in uptake was
found between PRO and NPB in the Sargasso Sea (Michelou et al.,

for PRO and NPB respectively], again possibly indicative of the
more P-stressed environment of the Sargasso Sea. Indeed, a recent
comparative, population genomics study of PRO and Pelagibacter,
from both HOT and Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS)
sites, found a signiﬁcantly higher abundance of genes related to P
acquisition and metabolism at BATS for both PRO and Pelagibacter
(Coleman and Chisholm, 2010). Such divergences among micro-
bial genotypes may also explain the apparent differences between
our results, particularly in terms of ATP utilization, within the
NPSG versus the studies conducted in the periodically severely
P-starved Sargasso Sea.

In closing, the implementation of ﬂow cytometric cell sorting,
in combination with more traditional ﬁltration techniques, in the
investigation of Pi or DOP utilization by speciﬁc microorganism
groups, has provided a novel tool to begin the unraveling of the
intricate P dynamics in the vast subtropical ecosystems. Our results
imply that the utilization of different phosphorus resources by
the smallest phototrophic cyanobacterium PRO and by NPB may
constitute a niche separating strategy. Although apparently equally
competitive for Pi, NPB was nearly exclusively responsible for the
utilization of ATP. This could be an important mechanism by
which groups of microorganisms co-exist and compete for limited
resources in the sunlit oligotrophic environments of the subtrop-
ical and tropical oceans. Further studies of Pi and DOP dynamics
should yield exciting new insights into the microbial mediation of
the P ﬂux through the particulate and dissolved pools.
