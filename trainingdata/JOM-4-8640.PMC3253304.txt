Background: The aim of this study was to assess subgingival microbiological changes in smokers versus
non-smokers presenting severe chronic periodontitis after supragingival periodontal therapy (ST).
Methods: Non-smokers (n10) and smokers (n10) presenting at least nine teeth with probing pocket
depth (PPD) (]5 mm), bleeding on probing (BoP), and no history of periodontal treatment in the last
6 months were selected. Clinical parameters assessed were plaque index (PI), BoP, PPD, relative gingival
margin position (rGMP) and relative clinical attachment level (rCAL). Subgingival biofilm was collected
before and 21 days after ST. DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with the universal
primer pair, 27F and 1492R. Amplified genes were cloned, sequenced, and identified by comparison with
known 16S rRNA sequences. Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t and Chi-Square tests (a5%).
Results: Clinically, ST promoted a significant reduction in PI and PPD, and gain of rCAL for both groups,
with no significant intergroup difference. Microbiologically, at baseline, data analysis demonstrated that
smokers harbored a higher proportion of Porphyromonas endodontalis, Bacteroidetes sp., Fusobacterium sp.
and Tannerella forsythia and a lower number of cultivated phylotypes (pB0.05). Furthermore, non-smokers
featured significant reductions in key phylotypes associated with periodontitis, whereas smokers presented
more modest changes.
Conclusion: Within the limits of the present study, ST promoted comparable clinical improvements in
smokers and non-smokers with severe chronic periodontitis. However, in smokers, ST only slightly affected
the subgingival biofilm biodiversity, as compared with non-smokers.

the primary goal of periodontal
therapy is to target the subgingival biofilm present in

periodontally-diseased sites, which is associated with the
progressive destruction of the supportive periodontal
tissues. It is well documented that conventional therapy,
i.e. subgingival scaling and root planing, is effective in the
achievement of this goal. Supragingival biofilm control
has been shown to play a critical role in the success of
periodontal therapy due to its impact on the subgingival
re-colonization (79).

supragingival biofilm control on the composition of
established subgingival biofilm in untreated periodontal
sites are found in the literature (1014).

Smoking has been implicated as a factor that reduces
the effectiveness of treatment. Smokers show less favor-
able responses to various kinds of periodontal treatments,
such as non-surgical, surgical, regeneration procedures,
and mucogingival surgery (1517). The mechanisms by
which smoking affects the response to periodontal
treatment might be related to the altered inflammatory
and immune response that has been observed in smokers
and/or to the persistence of pathogenic flora in smokers
after treatment (2, 18, 19). Studies have, therefore, aimed
to document a possible role of smoking in the oral
microbiota and, although no conclusive findings have
been reported, some data have demonstrated that there
are important differences in the composition of subgin-
gival biofilm between smokers and non-smokers with
chronic periodontal disease; which may, in fact, account
for the lower response of smokers to therapy (2022).

in the subgingival environment

With the concepts discussed above in mind, there is an
interest in the possible effect of supragingival biofilm
control
in untreated
periodontitis sites in smokers. In smokers, in the only
study available, supragingival periodontal therapy has
been shown to affect the total bacterial
load in the
subgingival biofilm with a non-significant
tendency
towards lower amounts of recognized periodontal patho-
gens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyro-
monas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia) in the treated
sites (23). However, in a recent and pioneer study in the
field, Shchipkova et al. (24) demonstrated that not only
red complex bacteria, but several other uncultivated
phylotypes, including ‘unsuspicious’ species in the sub-
gingival biofilm, may play a role in the disease etiology,
highlighting the necessity of expanding the analysis of the
periodontal microbiome to open-ended techniques. As
such,
it was hypothesized that
supragingival therapy (ST), consisting of supragingival
biofilm/calculus removal and dental surface polishing,
removal of biofilm retainers, oral hygiene instruction, and
reinforcement after 7 days, could affect subgingival
biofilm biodiversity at sites with untreated severe chronic
periodontitis in smokers. Microbiological analyses were
performed using the non-culture-dependent 16S rRNA
cloning and molecular sequencing. In addition, smokers
and non-smokers were followed clinically with respect to
the impact of the ST on the tissue stability.

in the present study,

Materials and methods

Ethics
This study was designed as a parallel, single-arm, and
controlled study to evaluate the clinical and microbiolo-
gical effects of ST on the biodiversity of subgingival

biofilm collected in smokers and non-smokers with
chronic periodontitis. Subjects included in the present
study were examined, treated by ST, and re-evaluated
21 days later. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) and patients received a detailed
description of the proposed treatment and gave their
informed and written consent.

Patient selection and groups
Potential patients were selected from those referred to the
Graduate Clinic of Piracicaba Dental School, University
of Campinas  UNICAMP, Brazil. All patients received a
complete periodontal examination,
including a full-
mouth periodontal probing, radiographic examination
and complete anamnesis.

The study inclusion criteria were:

(1) diagnosis of chronic periodontitis, according to the
criteria of the 1999 International Classification (25);

(2) presence of at least 20 teeth;
(3) at least nine teeth presenting probing pocket depth
(PPD)]5 mm with bleeding on probing (BoP; being
at least two with PPD]7 mm);

(4) 35 years of age.

treatment

Patients who:

(i) were pregnant or lactating;

(ii)
required antimicrobial pre-medication for the perfor-
mance of periodontal examination and treatment; (iii)
were suffering from any other systemic diseases (cardio-
vascular, pulmonary, liver, cerebral, or diabetes); (iv) had
received antimicrobial
in the previous
3 months; (v) were taking long-term anti-inflammatory
drugs; and/or (vi) had received a course of periodontal
treatment within the last 6 months; were excluded from
the study. A parallel, non-blinded and prospective study
was designed to enroll the following two groups: non-
smoker group (n10): patients diagnosed with general-
ized and severe chronic periodontitis and that had never
been smokers; and smoker group (n10): patients
diagnosed with generalized and severe chronic period-
ontitis and that had a smoking habit for at least 10 years
and smoked at least 20 cigarettes per day. Sample size was
determined by the Bioestat program, using a standard
deviation of 1.0 and a power value of 80% to detect a
difference between groups of 1.0 mm.

Supragingival therapy (ST)
After a full mouth examination and consent in participa-
tion, patients of both groups received a full mouth
prophylaxis, supragingival calculus, and biofilm removal,
using Gracey curettes, an ultrasonic scaler, bicarbonate
spray and floss, or interdental brushes, according to the
interdental space. Extraction of condemned teeth and
biofilm retentive factors removal were also performed.
The patients were also individually instructed on how to

perform oral self-care,
flossing, and tongue brushing. All
the
inter-dental
subjects of
the study received a standard fluoride
dentifrice, toothbrushes, and floss as necessary; and
were asked to perform complete oral self-care hygiene
at least twice a day. A week after this first instruction
session, patients returned to a reinforcement of oral self-
care instructions. Twenty-one days after ST, clinical re-
evaluation was performed and subgingival samples were
collected for microbiological analysis. The same indivi-
dual (DP) was trained to perform ST in all the patients,
whereas another individual was trained to perform base-
line and post-therapy clinical assessments (TM).

Clinical parameters
The following clinical parameters were assessed immedi-
ately before therapy: full-mouth plaque index (FMPI),
according to Ainamo and Bay (26), and full-mouth
bleeding score (FMBS), according to Mu¨ hlemann and
Son (27); these were calculated after assessing dichot-
omously the presence of dental biofilm at the site or BoP
from the bottom of the pocket when probing with a
manual probe.1 The percentage of total sites that revealed
the presence of plaque or bleeding was calculated. All
teeth presenting at least one site with PPD]5 mm were
selected for clinical evaluation. These teeth did not
present pulpal disease or furcation lesion (in order to
avoid bias). From those previously selected teeth, one site
(the deepest one) was selected and followed-up during the
experimental period, using an individually manufactured
acrylic stent in which a groove was made to standardize
the measurements. This selection resulted in a mean of
10.091.8 sites per patients evaluated during this study.
For the sites selected, clinical parameters were:

(1) probing pocket depth (PPD  distance from the

bottom of the pocket to the margin);
relative clinical attachment level (rCAL  distance
from the bottom of the pocket to the stent margin);
relative gingival margin position (rGMP  distance
from the gingival margin to the stent margin).

All parameters were evaluated using a periodontal
probe at baseline and 21 days after ST. The examinations
were performed by a calibrated examiner (TM). For this
calibration, three patients were selected and full mouth
rCAL and PPD were measured, twice, within 24 hours,
with at least 1 hour between the examinations. The intra-
class correlation was calculated for each parameter,
resulting in 93.5% reproducibility for rCAL and 94.3%
for PPD.

Supragingival therapy in smokers: clinical and microbial effects

Subgingival biofilm analysis
Subgingival biofilm collection
After a full-mouth examination, all sites previously
selected for clinical
follow-up were included in the
subgingival biofilm analysis, as described. Following the
careful removal of supragingival biofilm, the areas were
washed with a water spray, isolated with cotton rolls and
gently dried. A sterile paper point2 was inserted into the
bottom of the periodontal pocket for 30 s. Each paper
point was placed separately in sterile plastic tubes
containing 0.01 M Tris EDTA solution, pH 8.0 (TE).
DNA collection and extraction were performed as
described by Casarin et al. (28). For each patient, samples
from the selected sites were pooled together to allow the
16S cloning sequencing.

Cloning and sequencing
First, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using a universal
primer set (27f and 1492r) as described by de Lillo et al.
(29). Cloning procedures were performed using a TOPO-
TA cloning kit,3 following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Briefly, the amplicons resulting from universal
amplification were cloned into Escherichia coli and then
cultured overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) plates (contain-
ing ampicilin and X-gal) for posterior colony selection.
After colony selection, each colony was separately
cultivated overnight, in LB broth media.4 The LB broth
samples were then centrifuged to form a bacterial pellet
containing E. coli that received vectors/bacterial DNA.
After vector extraction, the products were purified5 and
sequenced.6 After sequencing, a partial sequence of 600
bp was generated. These sequences were initially aligned
and a similarity matrix was constructed from the align-
ments by the method of Jukes and Cantor (30) (Bioedit
7.0 Program (31)). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by
the neighbor joining method (Dotur Program (32)).
Sequences were compared using the HOMD database
(33) applying a level of 98.5% sequence identity as cut-off.
Sequences presenting 98% or greater similarity within a
genus were considered as the same species.

Data management and statistical analysis
Clinical parameters were analyzed by Student’s t test (for
baseline intergroup comparisons) and repeated-measures
ANOVA/Tukey (for clinical changes occurring after ST),
using the PROC GLM procedure of the SAS program.7
For microbiological data, a variance-stabilizing transfor-
mation, described by Shchipkova et al. (24), was used,

promoting a normal distribution of the data. After data
transformation, MannWhitney and Wilcoxon tests (for
inter and intragroup analysis, respectively) were used for
data analysis. For distribution and frequency analysis, the
Chi-Square test was employed. A 5% level of significance
was considered for clinical and microbiological data
analysis.

Results

Demographic and clinical data
Demographic characteristics and baseline comparisons
between groups are displayed in Table 1. There were no
statistical differences between groups regarding age or
gender, as well as in relation to full mouth clinical
parameters: plaque, BoP, periodontal probing depth,
and clinical attachment level (p0.05). Table 2 illustrates
the effect of ST on the clinical parameters assessed in the
selected sites (PPD]5 mm). At baseline,
intergroup
analysis
showed no
significant differences for any of the parameters assessed
(p0.05). The same results were seen after ST, with no
differences between the groups (p0.05). In contrast,
intragroup analysis (i.e. baseline vs.after ST, within the
same experimental group) demonstrated that ST led to a
significant reduction in PI, PPD, and rCAL (pB0.05);
whereas no significant changes were found with respect to
BoP and GMP, in smokers and non-smokers (p0.05).

status (cultivated and not-yet-cultivated). There was no
difference in phylum distribution between smokers and
non-smokers, neither at baseline nor after ST. In regards
to cultivation status, non-smoker subjects presented a
higher prevalence of cultivated indexes compared with
smokers at baseline, and at after ST (pB0.05). In
addition, 21 days after ST, an increase in cultivated
phylotypes was seen only in non-smokers (pB0.05).

Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of 16S clonal
analysis by genera in non-smokers and smokers, before
and after ST. As noted, at baseline, smokers demon-
strated significantly greater levels of the genera Fusobac-
terium and Bacteroides, whereas non-smokers presented
higher levels of Eubacterium, Synergistes, and Strepto-
coccus (Chi-Square test, pB0.05).

Moreover, ST altered the genera distribution in both
groups. In non-smokers, a significant reduction in some
genera such as Eubacterium, Filifactor, Tannerella, Tre-
ponema, and Fusobacterium was observed, whereas only
Filifactor and Fusobacterium were reduced in smokers
after ST (pB0.05). The difference in genera distribution
was still observed after ST, where Streptococcus was more
present in non-smokers (pB0.05) and Bacteroides and
Porphyromonas were found more in smokers (pB0.05).

The 20 most detected phylotypes were analyzed
separately with regard to their frequency and proportions
in the subgingival biofilm (Table 4). Significant differ-
ences were observed in levels of certain species between
current and never-smokers. Smokers presented higher
levels of Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii and

non-smokers presented lower levels of Filifactor alocis,

their microbial profile.

Discussion
The habit of smoking has been reported to negatively
affect periodontal tissues, cell defense, and host response.
In addition, microbiological evaluations also indicate a
possible influence on subgingival microflora. However,
very limited information is available with respect to the
effect of ST on the biodiversity of the subgingival biofilm
in smokers with chronic periodontitis. With this in mind,
it was hypothesized that ST, consisting of standard
methods used for supragingival biofilm removal and
control, including supragingival biofilm/calculus removal

and dental surface polishing, removal of biofilm retai-
ners, oral hygiene instruction and reinforcement after
7 days, would affect subgingival biofilm profile in
smokers with severe chronic periodontitis. Subgingival
biofilm biodiversity was assessed by the 16S gene cloning
technique and clinical parameters were also used to
illustrate clinical conditions at baseline and after ST in
smokers and non-smokers. Data analyses demonstrated
that: (i) there were significant differences in the sub-
gingival biofilm composition, at baseline,
in smokers
versus non-smokers; (ii) subgingival biodiversity was
significantly affected by ST in non-smokers, whereas
only a slight effect was observed for smokers; and (iii)
clinical response was not affected by dissimilar micro-
biological outcomes to ST in smokers versus non-
smokers.

With non-surgical subgingival therapy as the main
treatment modality, most authors report greater reduc-
tions in probing depth in non-smokers, compared with
smokers (19, 3438). It is, therefore, important to note
that there is substantial evidence for the clinical improve-
ment in smokers after treatment, indicating that smoking,
as a risk factor, will compromise rather than prevent

tissue healing. In non-smokers, ST results in a reduction
in gingival bleeding, probing depth, and a gain in
attachment level (7, 9, 13, 14, 39, 40). In smokers,
however, there was a lack of information on the impact
of ST on the periodontal tissues at untreated sites.

Gomes et al., in 2007 (40), were the only group to
assess the changes in periodontal tissues after a supra-
gingival periodontal therapy. In their study, ST consisted
of supragingival calculus removal with hand curettes,
extractions, endodontic treatment, placement of tempor-
ary restorations, and prostheses. Similarly to the findings
of the present study, Gomes et al. (40) demonstrated that
a comparable clinical outcome was reached for smokers
and non-smokers regardless of the severity of the disease.
Both groups featured a reduction in plaque and bleeding
indices, as well as a reduction in probing depth, and gain
in clinical attachment level after 30 days of ST, which was
maintained for up to 180 days (40). In addition, as
previously reported by others, in the present study, data
analyses demonstrated that smokers presented a lower
reduction in plaque index (PI) than non-smokers. More-
over, as expected, deep pockets presented only a mild
change after ST: only a discrete reduction in BoP index
was observed in smokers and non-smokers. In summary,
available clinical data suggest that smokers and non-
smokers with severe chronic periodontitis may similarly
benefit from ST.

In the present study, we aimed to determine whether or
not ST affected subgingival biofilm biodiversity in both
groups. Often, studies have focused on assessing,
in
smoking and non-smoking conditions,
the effect of
periodontal therapy on genera associated with period-
ontal disease, including P. gingivalis, Treponema denti-
cola, and T. forsythia (7, 11, 12, 41, 42). However, an
important study demonstrated that tobacco might also
affect the levels of genera not always associated with
periodontal disease (24). In the present study, using an
open-ended approach, a comparison between the sub-
gingival biofilm composition of smokers and non-smo-
kers at baseline (before ST), revealed a higher presence of
certain genera, such as Fusobacterium (genus associated
with periodontal disease) and Bacteroides; and lower
levels of Streptococcus, Synergistes, and Eubacterium.
These findings seem to confirm that tobacco exposure
may lead to a subgingival biofilm composed not only in a
higher proportion by pathogens associated with period-
ontal disease, but also some species, not commonly
included as periodontal pathogens in target-ended or
selective techniques.

However,

in addition to presenting a reduction in
‘health-associated’ biofilm and an increase in ‘disease-
associated’ biofilm, in the present study, smokers showed
a lower response to ST, compared with non-smoker
subjects as regards the microbiological composition of
the subgingival biofilm. Non-smokers had a significant

reduction in five species commonly associated with
periodontal disease following ST, whereas in smokers
only the levels of F. alocis were significantly reduced. In
addition, after ST in smokers, disease-associated species,
including P. endodontalis, were found to be increased.

P. endodontalis has been listed as one of the potential
‘new species’ associated with periodontal disease (43),
and the fact that P. endodontalis has additionally been
shown to be reduced in subgingival biofilm when the
smoking habit is given up (44), suggesting this species as
an important factor that might contribute to the patho-
genesis of periodontal disease in smokers. The apparent
reduction in some species in the subgingival biofilm after
ST may be explained by the intimate relationship between
both supra- and subgingival environments (45), and also
as a result of the mild, but statistically significant, clinical
benefits promoted by ST after 21 days. The probing depth
reduction may have led to significant changes in nutri-
ents, oxygen, and microorganisms disposable in period-
ontal pockets, altering subgingival microflora. Moreover,
the reduced microbiological effect of ST on smoker-
subgingival microbiota, has been a common goal
in
previous studies. Furthermore when subgingival scaling
and root planing are performed, smokers appear to
remain positive for periodontitis-associated species, in-
cluding P. gingivalis, T. denticola, T. forsythia, P. inter-
media, F. nucleatum, and Parvimonas micra (41, 46, 47).
Therefore, after ST performance and the assessment of
baseline and follow-up parameters, all
the patients
enrolled in this study were then treated by the conven-
tional subgingival scaling and root planing approach.

In conclusion, in smokers, ST only slightly affected the
subgingival biofilm biodiversity, as compared with non-
smokers. However, clinically, the response in smokers and
non-smokers was similar regardless of the differential
impact of ST on the subgingival biofilm composition in
these groups of patients.
