The thermally dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the causative agent of
paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the most frequent systemic mycosis that affects the rural
populations in Latin America. Despite signiﬁcant developments in antifungal chemother-
apy,
its efﬁcacy remains limited since drug therapy is prolonged and associated with
toxic side effects and relapses. In response to these challenges, it is now recognized
that several aspects of antifungal immunity can be modulated to better deal with fungal
infections. A common idea for halting fungal infections has been the need to activate a cell-
based, pro-inﬂammatoryTh1 immune response to improve the fungal elimination. ArtinM, a
D-mannose binding lectin from Artocarpus heterophyllus, has the property of modulating
immunity against several intracellular pathogens. Here, we review the immunomodulatory
activity of ArtinM during experimental PCM in mice. Both prophylactic and therapeutic pro-
tocols of ArtinM administration promotes aTh1 immune response balanced by IL-10, which
outstandingly reduces the fungal load in organs of the treated mice while maintaining a
controlled inﬂammation at the site of infection. A carbohydrate recognition-based interac-
tion of ArtinM withToll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) accounts for initiating the immunomodulatory
effect of the lectin. The precise identiﬁcation of the TLR2 N-glycan(s) targeted by ArtinM
may support novel basis for the development of antifungal therapy.

BALANCING RESISTANCE AND TOLERANCE TO FUNGI
The two main components of the host immune response to
fungi, namely, resistance (the ability to limit fungal burden) and
tolerance (the ability to limit host damage caused by immune
response or other mechanisms) highlight the bipolar nature of the
inﬂammatory process in fungal infections. Both components must
be considered when developing any therapeutic or prophylactic
antifungal procedure.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are primarily responsible for antigen
recognition, decoding this information, and then stimulating var-
ious T cell pathways using speciﬁc cytokine signals. The T cell
subsets in turn secrete cytokines that mediate protective or detri-
mental/pathogenic effects on phagocytes and the inﬂammatory
process. The primary protective response against fungal disease is
the cell-mediated Th1 response (Calich and Kashino, 1998; Netea
et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2009; Ito, 2011). Th1 lymphocytes pro-
duce IFN-γ, which stimulates the antifungal activity of PMN and
macrophages.

Otherwise, some cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 provide sig-
nals that favor a Th2-mediated immune response by lymphocytes.
By diminishing the Th1 cell response and promoting antibody
production and T regulatory cells,
it favors fungal infections,
fungus-associated allergic responses, and disease relapse (Benard
et al., 1997; Netea et al., 2004; Müller et al., 2007). Therefore, Th2
immunity is associated with severe and disseminated forms of
fungal infections. This pattern is well established and reported
in cryptococcosis (Müller et al., 2007), paracoccidioidomycosis

(PCM; Calich and Kashino, 1998; Ruas et al., 2009), and candidi-
asis (Netea et al., 2004; Haraguchi et al., 2010).

In this review, we discuss the role of a plant lectin named
ArtinM in a murine model of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infec-
tion, highlighting its immunomodulatory properties and the
importance of
the modulation of a cell-mediated immune
response in the resistance to the fungus. We discuss the aspects
that make this lectin an excellent candidate for further studies as
a potential therapeutic for severe cases of PCM in human patients
or for development as a prophylactic for individuals at risk for
severe disease.

IMMUNITY TO PARACOCCIDIOIDES BRASILIENSIS
INFECTION
The most common human systemic mycosis in Latin America
is PCM, which is caused by the dimorphic fungus P. brasiliensis.
Infection occurs by inhalation of fungal spores or particles, which
transform into the pathogenic yeast form after reaching the pul-
monary alveolar epithelium (Restrepo-Moreno, 1993). Yeast can
either be eliminated by immune-competent cells or disseminate to
other tissues through lymphatic and hematogenous routes, result-
ing in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, which vary from
asymptomatic, benign and localized to severe and disseminated
forms (Borges-Walmsley et al., 2002). Clinical and experimen-
tal evidences indicate that, similar to other systemic mycosis,
Th1 immunity exerts a singular role in the asymptomatic form
of PCM, while a Th2 pattern is associated with progression to

the severe disease form (Cano et al., 1998; Karhawi et al., 2000;
Benard et al., 2001; Oliveira et al., 2002; Peraçoli et al., 2003;
Ruas et al., 2009).

These immune patterns of resistance or susceptibility to fungal
infections have been studied in murine models of infection that
simulate human mycosis. Animal models facilitate the study of
immune response mechanisms involved in PCM. Resistant mice
produce early and sustained levels of IFN-γ and IL-2, whereas sus-
ceptible mice produce low levels of IFN-γ, but signiﬁcant levels of
IL-5 and IL-10 (Calich and Kashino, 1998; Kashino et al., 2000).
Murine models have also showed that IFN-γ and TNF-α activate
macrophages to exert effects against P. brasiliensis (Brummer et al.,
1989; Gonzales et al., 2003). The essential role of these cytokines
has been further demonstrated using mice that are genetically deﬁ-
cient in either the IFN-γ or the TNF-α receptor (Cano et al., 1998;
Souto et al., 2000). Indeed, the presence of cytokines accounting
for the activation of macrophages, which is necessary for fungal
killing, has been consistently documented (Gonzales et al., 2000;
Moreira et al., 2008, 2010).

The importance of innate immunity in the recognition of
fungi has been extensively reviewed elsewhere (Roeder et al.,
2004; Romani, 2004), and it has been recently characterized for
P. brasiliensis infection (Loures et al., 2009, 2010, 2011). The lack
of the receptors Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or TLR4 did not
alter the survival rates of mice infected with P. brasiliensis. TLR2
knockout (KO) mice infected with P. brasiliensis presented with
increased Th17 immunity, associated with an impaired regulatory
T cell expansion, which resulted in an uncontrolled inﬂamma-
tory reaction. Therefore, the authors concluded that the presence
of TLR2 in P. brasiliensis infection is important to downregulate
Th17 immunity and lung pathological condition (Loures et al.,
2009). TLR4-deﬁcient mice presented lower fungal loads than the
TLR4-normal mice, but these mice were unable to clear the infec-
tion completely owing to enhanced regulatory T cells and low
inﬂammation (Loures et al., 2010).

Current treatment for PCM relies on antifungal chemother-
apy to control the disease. Clinically, the antifungal drugs most
commonly used for PCM treatment include amphotericin B,
sulfa derivatives, and azoles, but their toxicity can be a lim-
iting factor in the treatment (Mendes et al., 1994). Treatment
regimens with these agents often require extended periods of
maintenance therapy, which may range from months to years,
and are usually associated with relapses (Shikanai-Yasuda et al.,
2006). Moreover, even after prolonged administration of these
drugs, there is no guarantee that the fungus will be completely
eradicated.

Based on these data, there is a strong need for alternative clin-
ical treatments to chemotherapy. Researchers have focused their
efforts in investigating fungal components able to promote cellular
immune responses and host protection. Immunization with heat-
shock proteins (HSPs) from P. brasiliensis has also been shown
to provide some degree of protection against experimental dis-
ease (Soares et al., 2008; Ribeiro et al., 2009, 2010). Recently, it
was shown that plasmid immunization with a peptide derived
from the 43-kDa glycoprotein antigen from the fungus, called
P10, was shown to be protective against PCM, inducing a reduc-
tion in fungal load in the lungs of experimentally infected mice

(Rittner et al., 2012). Although these studies focused on the use
of fungal components to immunize mice against P. brasiliensis
infection, it was shown that immunotherapy with a Th1-inducing
adjuvant that was independent of Pb antigens has a beneﬁcial effect
against PCM (Oliveira et al., 2008). A single-dose administration
of the adjuvant in infected mice was sufﬁcient to restore their abil-
ity to mount an effective immune response to the fungus. These
data support that stimulation of the host Th1 immune response
is a promising approach toward expanding available treatment
options for systemic fungal diseases,
including PCM. More-
over, Th1 stimulation may be achieved irrespective of whether
P. brasiliensis antigens are used, providing new possibilities for the
use of alternative drugs against the disease

IMMUNOMODULATION BY ArtinM
ArtinM (also known as KM
or Artocarpin) (Pereira Da Silva et al.,
2008) is a lectin from Artocarpus heterophyllus seeds that speciﬁ-
cally recognizes the trisaccharide Manα1–3 [Manα1–6] Man core
of N-glycans. ArtinM is a homotetramer formed by 13-kDa sub-
units, each one corresponding to a β-barrel, with a β-prism fold-
ing, which includes a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD).
ArtinM cDNA has been cloned and heterologously expressed in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli (Silva et al., 2005).
Native (ArtinM) and recombinant (rArtinM) proteins share the
same sugar recognition speciﬁcity and are equivalents in terms
of the kinetics of binding afﬁnity to a glycoligand (Pesquero
et al., 2010). The ArtinM CRD is preserved in rArtinM, and the
recombinant protein retains the same biological properties as the
native form, with the advantage that it does not form oligomers.
ArtinM possesses many relevant biological properties in cells of the
immune system, which is reﬂected in the modulation of immu-
nity during infection with intracellular pathogens. The lectin acts
on mast cells and induces degranulation (Moreno et al., 2003).
It also acts on neutrophils and induces haptotactic migration,
as well as phenotypic and functional changes, which include
intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation, shedding of L-selectin,
release of inﬂammatory mediators, phagocytic and cell-killing
activities, and increased expression of TLR2 (Ganiko et al., 2005;
Toledo et al., 2009).

The pioneering observation on the ArtinM immunomodula-
tory activity was its ability to induce IL-12 production in murine
macrophages. This cytokine production then promoted a switch
in the BALB/c mouse immune response from Th2- to Th1-
mediated immunity against Leishmania major antigens. Cytokine
production was dependent on the CRD of the lectin, since IL-12
production was selectively inhibited by D-mannose, which is an
ArtinM-speciﬁc ligand (Panunto-Castelo et al., 2001).

Additional studies have shown that the beneﬁts provided by
the immunomodulation induced by ArtinM can be extended
to several infections in which a Th1-biased immunity is nec-
essary for resistance, including the murine model of Candida
albicans infection. Infected mice that were treated with ArtinM
developed Th1- and Th17-mediated immune responses; their
macrophages and neutrophils exhibited increased phagocytical
and candidacidal activities (Custodio et al., 2011). The augmented
phagocytosis of yeast cells by macrophages from ArtinM-treated
mice occurred via mannose and dectin-1. This effect explains

the faster clearance of C. albicans in the initial phase of infec-
tion in mice, which favors ArtinM-induced protection against
disseminated candidiasis (Loyola et al., 2012).

Knowledge about the immunomodulatory effects of ArtinM
on PCM is derived from studies that used an experimental model
developed in BALB/c mice that had been intravenously infected
with P. brasiliensis. Trials involving several protocols for the thera-
peutic and prophylactic administration of ArtinM showed that the
most effective therapeutic protocol consisted of a single subcuta-
neous injection of ArtinM 10 days after infection, whereas the best
prophylaxis was attained by the administration of two subcuta-
neous injections of ArtinM on day 10 and day 3 before infection.
The beneﬁcial effects of therapeutic and prophylactic regimens
(Coltri et al., 2008, 2010) of ArtinM on the severity of P. brasilien-
sis infection, which manifested on day 30 post-infection, included
marked decrease in fungal burden and absence of granulomas
in the lungs, which exhibited a well-preserved bronchoalveolar
architecture. This pattern was in contrast to what was observed
in the untreated mice, which had disseminated infection and

multiple sites of focal and conﬂuent epithelioid granulomas with
lymphomonocytic halos circumscribing a high number of viable
and non-viable yeast cells (Figure 1). The lesions were larger
and still disseminated on day 60 after infection, while ArtinM-
treated mice had no granulomas or yeast cells in the liver, spleen or
lung tissue.

The advantages of ArtinM administration correlate with an
adequate milieu of pulmonary mediators. Lung homogenates
from mice that were infected with P. brasiliensis and then sub-
jected to prophylactic or therapeutic ArtinM regimen showed
higher levels of the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-12 and TNF-
α, and NO. ArtinM administration drove cytokine production
from a Th2 immune response pattern to a Th1 immune response
pattern. High concentrations of IL-4 and low concentrations
of IFN-γ were detected in untreated control mice, whereas in
ArtinM-treated mice, lower IL-4 and higher IFN-γ concentra-
tions were stably produced during the course of the disease, as
illustrated in Figure 2. It was clear that a drive toward Th1-
mediated immunity is stimulated in vivo by ArtinM. Interestingly,

lesions in the lungs, with epithelioid granulomas surrounding a large number
of yeast cells. Infected mice treated with ArtinM present no granulomas, and
lung architecture is similar to that of uninfected mice. The lung sections were
stained with H&E (Modiﬁed from Coltri et al., 2010).

lower IL-4 and higher IFN-γ and NO pulmonary levels, which reﬂected in
lower fungal load.

stable IL-10 production was also veriﬁed in the ArtinM-treated
mice, indicating that the induced Th1 response is balanced by
the effects of this anti-inﬂammatory cytokine. Studies involv-
ing IL-12 KO mice have demonstrated the importance of IL-12
for ArtinM-mediated beneﬁcial effects on experimental PCM.
When these mice were infected with P. brasiliensis, treatment with
ArtinM exerted no protective effects against the infection. The
parallel utilization of an ArtinM recombinant form to treat the
P. brasiliensis-infected mice has provided evidence that the admin-
istration of ArtinM or its recombinant form (rArtinM) exerts an
equally protective effect against P. brasiliensis infection (Coltri
et al., 2008, 2010).

ArtinM TARGETS TLR2 N-GLYCANS TO INDUCE IL-12
PRODUCTION
The role of the 70-kDa heterodimeric cytokine IL-12 in the activa-
tion of type 1 immune response is largely recognized. Its bioactive
IL-12p70 form is composed of two disulﬁde-linked subunits: a
40-kDa heavy chain of (p40) and a 35-kDa light chain (p35).
Macrophages and DCs are the major cell types producing this
cytokine, which is released as the biologically inactive peptide
IL-12p40 as well as the biologically active IL-12p70. IL-12 acts
on T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and induces
IFN-γ production. This hallmark Th1 cytokine is responsible for
T cell proliferation and enhancement of macrophage cytotoxic
activity (Kobayashi et al., 1989; Wolf et al., 1991).

IL-12 production by phagocytes is generally initiated by the
interaction of cell-surface TLRs with pathogen-associated molec-
ular patterns (PAMPs). TLRs constitute a protein family of cellular
receptors that mediate recognition of microbial pathogens and
subsequent inﬂammatory response in vertebrates. These receptors
confer PAMP recognition and their signaling triggers synthesis
followed by release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, and induces
expression of co-stimulatory molecules for promoting activa-
tion of adaptive immunity during antigen presentation (Janeway
and Medzhitov, 2002). Upon recognition of respective PAMPs,
TLRs recruit a speciﬁc set of adaptor molecules that harbor TIR
domains, such as MyD88 and TRIF, and initiate downstream sig-
naling events that lead to the activation of the transcription factor
and its translocation into the nucleus to induce the expression of
pro-inﬂammatory genes, including the IL-12-coding gene. Inﬂam-
matory cytokines are released from the cell into the extracellular
matrix, and they promote the recruitment of neutrophils to the site
of infection, activation of macrophages, and induction of IFN-γ-
stimulated genes, resulting in direct killing of invading pathogens.
Moreover, activation of TLR signaling leads to the maturation of
DCs, which contributes to the induction of adaptive immunity
(West et al., 2006).

The involvement of MyD88-mediated signaling in the
enhanced secretion of ArtinM-induced IL-12 was proved by the
fact that macrophages from MyD88KO mice did not respond
to in vitro stimulation with the lectin. To investigate whether
TLR2 was involved in ArtinM-induced IL-12 production, an
in vitro assay was performed to quantify the IL-12 concen-
trations released by ArtinM-stimulated macrophages from the
TLR2KO or TLR4-deﬁcient mice. Macrophages from TLR2KO
mice, distinctly from those from TLR4-deﬁcient or WT mice,

were unable to produce IL-12 in response to ArtinM stimulus.
Moreover, IL-12 production by ArtinM-stimulated macrophages
was inhibited by D-mannose, which indicates that its production
is dependent on the lectin CRD. These results demonstrate that
TLR2 plays a critical role in ArtinM-mediated production of IL-12
(Coltri et al., 2008).

Potential N-linked glycosylation sites have been revealed by
amino acid sequencing analysis of all known TLRs. Several lines
of evidence indicate that oligosaccharides attached to TLRs play
important roles in the recognition of PAMPs, and in the formation
of a functional receptor complex on the cell surface (Ohnishi et al.,
2001, 2003; da Silva Correia and Ulevitch, 2002; Weber et al., 2004).
Concerning human TLR2,
its ectodomain contains N-glycans
linked to the residues Asn114, Asn199, Asn414, and Asn442;
among them, the glycan linked to Asn442 was reported to con-
tribute to efﬁcient secretion of the TLR2 ectodomain (Weber et al.,
2004) and cellular recognition of PAMPS (Kataoka et al., 2006).
Direct interaction of ArtinM with TLR2 was further demon-
strated by a gene reporter assay involving TLR2-transfected cells
(unpublished data). Currently, TLR2 mutants for the ectodomain
glycosylation sites (generated in Dr. Nicholas Gay’s laboratory,
University of Cambridge, UK) are being used to identify the
glycan(s) targeted by ArtinM.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND PERSPECTIVES
ArtinM administration interferes with the outcome of P. brasilien-
sis infection by modulating host immunity according to the
following events:

(a) recognition of TLR2 glycans by the lectin,
(b) induction of IL-12 production,
(c) generation of Th1-balanced immunity, and
(d) protection against P. brasiliensis, mainly manifested by the

occurrence of milder lung lesions and low fungal burden.

IL-12-dependent mechanism of protection is a process trig-
gered by the MyD88/TLR2 signaling pathway. Detection of IL-10
production in ArtinM-treated animals reveals that the induced
Th1-prone immune response is regulated in a way that prevents
systemic immune pathology, as indicated by the absence of exac-
erbated inﬂammatory lesions in ArtinM-treated animals (Coltri
et al., 2008, 2010). As part of a study on the pleiotropic activ-
ities of ArtinM, we are trying to identify the IL-10-producing
cells.

Observations concerning the immunomodulatory effects of
ArtinM support the use of this protein, in its native or recom-
binant form, as an immunomodulatory agent that can stimulate
balanced Th1 immunity, which is required to protect the host
against fungal infection. Otherwise, complete characterization of
the N-glycan(s) recognized by ArtinM in TLR2 molecules may
provide an adequate target for the development of novel antifungal
therapies.
