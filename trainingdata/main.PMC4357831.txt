However, biological knowledge is still needed to improve the understanding of complex mechanisms such as plant immune responses.
Better knowledge of this process could improve crop production and management.
Here, we used holistic analysis to combine our own microarray and RNA-seq data with public genomic data from Arabidopsis and cassava in order to acquire biological knowledge about the relationships between proteins encoded by immunity-related genes (IRGs) and other genes.
This approach was based on a kernel method adapted for the construction of gene networks.
The obtained results allowed us to propose a list of new IRGs.
A putative function in the immunity pathway was pre- dicted for the new IRGs.
The analysis of networks revealed that our predicted IRGs are either well documented or recognized in previous co-expression studies.
In addition to robust relationships between IRGs, there is evidence suggesting that other cellular processes may be also strongly related to immunity.

How- ever, the data stored in genomic databases does not itself pro- vide an understanding of biological processes and has not always been generated under biological conditions of interest.
Nevertheless, available data could be combined with own data generated in-house for the biological condition of interest to improve results and generate more conﬁdent biological conclu- sions.
The new challenge is to develop mathematical methods  1672-0229/$ - see front matter ª 2013 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of China.

Approaches to extract knowledge from genomic dat- abases and combine these data with new experimental data should allow the integration, interpretation and analysis of genomic and post-genomic data and should represent the ac- quired biological knowledge in the form of gene or protein net- works showing functional/co-expression relationships or other structured representation.
This representation should reﬂect relationships at the individual and categorical levels, which would assemble genes/proteins of known, unknown and hypo- thetical functions.
Several different approaches have been developed in recent years to assess relationships between functionally known and unknown genes/proteins through biological networks and pre- dict new functions of genes/proteins, especially in humans [1].
These methods are often supervised and allow the integration of multiple genomic data sources in different ways [2,3], thus generating reliable and robust results, often including the pre- diction of new protein functions [4].
Due to the speciﬁc and complicated characteristics of genomic data, proper analysis and generation of useful inference represent real mathematical and statistical challenges.
Predictions of function are better conducted using methods that allow the integration of prior knowledge (supervised methods), the identiﬁcation of non-linear relationships and the fusion of heterogeneous genomic and post-genomic data.
Kernel methods [5] have these characteristics and among them, kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) can be useful in relating proteins of known function with those of unknown function to predict participation in processes of interest.
Earlier studies have reported the use of KCCA methods to predict the functions of unknown proteins [4,6,7].
KCCA of- fers a rigorous mathematical but also intuitive framework to represent biological data through kernel [4,5].
KCCA provides a methodology for supervised network infer- ence and does not require exhaustive data assumptions [8].
It is therefore in contrast to alternative strategies such as Naı  ve Bayes (NB) models [9], which require regularization methods and have challenges of computational efﬁciency in the presence of many data sets [10].
functions  (PPRs) or  resistance (R) proteins,  Losses caused by plant pathogens represent one of the most important limitations in crop production, which can compro- mise the food supply [11].
Plant immunity depends on the rec- ognition of conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) or strain-speciﬁc effectors by pattern recognition receptors leading to MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI), respectively [11,12].
Upon recognition, plants activate a complex network of responses that includes signal transduction pathways, novel protein interactions and coordi- nated changes in gene expression [13].
Detailed information concerning speciﬁc and punctual interactions between effector and resistance proteins has been accumulated in the recent years  in some cases, a global picture for some of these interac- tions has been established [9,14].
Immunity networks have been described for model plants such as Arabidopsis and rice primarily using yeast-two hybrid experiments [15,16].
In this study, we employed a kernel-based approach to reconstruct functional relationships between genes based on genomic and post-genomic data from various sources (primar- ily extracted from databases but also produced by laboratory  experiments) for a group of well-characterized immunity-re- lated genes (IRGs).
We employed this approach to analyze Arabidopsis and cassava (Manihotesculenta), a staple crop with little genomic information available, following challenge with bacterial pathogens.
This approach allowed us to identify a group of new IRGs in both species.
Many of the identiﬁed genes were of unknown function.
Based on our further detailed analyses and literature knowledge, we established a list of top gene candidates potentially related to immune responses.
These results indicate that publically-available data can be combined with in-house generated data using novel data-min- ing methods to potentially answer challenging biological questions.
Results  Exploratory analysis of categorical data  A total of 22 datasets were collected for Arabidopsis and cas- sava (see Materials and methods section for more details).
Number of genes and the number of columns for each dataset are listed in Tables S1 and S2.
To obtain a preliminary archi- tecture of the data, we conducted classical descriptive multi- variate analyses using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) [17] as a ﬁrst step to evaluate the data structure, reveal un- known relationships and reveal clusters of genes potentially in- volved in immune responses.
Our results showed that no groups of IRGs were clearly detected, indicating that func- tional relationships cannot be extracted using linear descriptive methods.
Nevertheless, we were able to summarize the infor- mation of microarray data with fewer variables using an exploratory descriptive analysis.
We found that most of the information contained in the microarrays is correlated and can be represented with two new variables (principal compo- nents).
Accordingly, only a small portion of genes have differ- ent expression behaviors across experiments, which could be new IRGs.
Furthermore, we found that RNA-seq data con- tains information that complements the microarray data.
These results are useful and indicate that expression data con- tains valuable information to differentiate IRGs from non- IRGs if a more appropriate method is implemented.
All in all, the exploratory analyses showed that IRGs can- not be grouped together using only linear methods and meth- ods such as KCCA (introduced in following section) are desired.
For details on the procedure and the results of explor- atory analyses, see the Supplementary File 1.
Relationship between genes/proteins obtained using KCCA  Since linear relationships between gene expression variables did not show any structure or pattern that allowed the group- ing of IRGs based on either categorical or continuous data, we used non-linear kernel methods to integrate both types of data for extraction of relationships between genes.
We used the supervised KCCA method [6] to predict functional relation- ships between genes.
To do this, two reference datasets were used in the KCCA, including the real reference dataset and a random reference dataset of IRGs constructed by randomly placing a similar number of IRGs from the real reference in ﬁve categories to emulate ﬁve types of IRGs.

We pre- dicted   partners   or new IRGs per each known IRG.
New IRGs were identiﬁed when they were projected closer to known IRGs with a chosen distance threshold (Table 1).
This procedure provided a network and therefore a list of partners per IRG.
Networks were drawn using Cytoscape 3.0 [18] for Arabidopsis and cassava (Figure 1).
Some types of interactions in the networks were identiﬁed (Figure 2).
These include direct interaction between a known IRG with another known IRG or newly-predicted IRG (Fig- ure 2A).
Indirect interaction between two known IRGs was also observed via bridging effect of a newly-predicted IRG (Figure 2B).
In addition, ternary direct interaction among known IRGs was also noticed (Figure 2C).
The statistics of these types of interactions are summarized in Table 2.
KCCA relationships and their interpretation showed differences be- tween species.
There are 19 partners on average for each IRG in Arabidopsis and 30 in cassava.
However, in Arabidop- sis, IRGs were mainly connected to other IRGs, where as such pattern was not observed in cassava.
Moreover, the global clustering coefﬁcient for Arabidopsis was much higher than that for cassava, showing high connectivity among IRGs.
The results obtained using random reference datasets showed different patterns, compared to the real reference datasets of IRGs.
In both species, the average number of partners per  IRG regarding the total interaction was much higher.
In addi- tion, 20,305 non-IRGs in Arabidopsis were predicted to be partners of IRGs, which include almost all genes in this species (approximately 27,000 genes in total).
In cassava, a less dense network was generated, possibly due to the low number of microarray experiments that only cover a small spectrum of conditions.
These results indicate that our method showed higher selectivity with real datasets than with random datasets, thus the identiﬁed interactions would be unlikely random but instead speciﬁc.
The average degree of the nodes and the global clustering coefﬁcients are plotted in Figure 3.
High level of connectivity is detected when an IRG is excluded from the network and both the average node degree and clustering coefﬁcient decrease (large downward peaks for the same IRG).
According to our analysis, some IRGs and their predicted neighbors are highly connected with each other.
IRGs that have a low number of partners (small downward peak in Figure 3, left panels for aver- age node degrees) and belong to many triplets (large downward peaks in Figure 3, right panels for clustering coefﬁcients) are thought to have highly speciﬁc interactions to form small clus- ters.
In contrast, IRGs having many partners (large peaks in Fig- ure 3, left panels) could be identiﬁed as hubs in the network.
Median (middle line) in boxplots in Figure 3 shows that Arabid- opsis IRGs (top panels) have fewer but more highly intercon- nected partners than cassava IRGs (bottom panels).
Common features in the predictions for both species  Fisher s exact test [19] was applied and it allowed us to identify 89 and 87 GO terms that were overrepresented in the networks from Arabidopsis and cassava, respectively.
Among them, 61 terms were overrepresented in both networks, suggesting that the genes identiﬁed in both plants are functionally similar.
The most overrepresented terms in both networks included various types of kinase activity, stress responses, immune re- sponses and processes related to cell death.
However, these  IRG networks for Arabidopsis and cassava  Figure 1 Network representation of functional relationships obtained for Arabidopsis (A) and cassava (B).

data should be taken with caution, since some genes sharing the same GO category could be orthologous genes.
Analysis of predicted relationships in Arabidopsis  We then focused on some of the most important IRGs and performed a detailed analysis of the predicted partners of 12 well-known IRGs described in the literature and gene network databases (Table 3).
Based on the data, we were able to show that BRI1, for example, is one of the partners of BAK1.
BAK1 is a regulator of the tradeoff between immunity and responses to hormones [20] and a co-receptor of FLS2 that triggers plant immunity after the recognition of ﬂagellin [21].
Interestingly, previous studies indicated that BAK1 interacts with BRI1, a  for  receptor the growth hormone brassinosteroid [22].
Therefore, our prediction is strengthened with the biological data reported in the literature.
Similarly, we found that CLV2 was among the top 10 partners for CLV1.
CLV1 is a receptor kinase expressed in the center of the shoot apical mer- istem and interacts with CLV2 and other proteins to control meristem development [23].
Furthermore, a link between mer- istem development and plant immunity in the shoot was re- cently established [24].
A third example is extracted from the partners of CERK1.
CERK1 is achitin receptor that triggers a response to fungi [25].
Arabidopsis plants expressing a mu- tant CERK1 also exhibited compromised resistance to bacteria [26].
Among the top 10 partners for CERK1 are the genes NDF4 and GSTL2, which code for an electron carrier and a glutathione S-transferase, respectively.
The expression of these two genes is co-regulated, as reported in the CoEXpression network [27].
GSTL2 is a protein involved in the redox balance and the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are central to plant immunity.
Besides, ROS production is one of the primary responses mediated by CERK1 [25].
In addition to analyzing the data presented in the literature, we also searched for the functions of the top 10 partners through BLASTX to complement the information about rela- tionships of predicted IRG partners.

assigned to 51 of 107 predicted partners in Arabidopsis (see Supplementary File 2).
This information is also useful to ﬁlter the partners and to select the best ones for future experiments that employ the corresponding Arabidopsis mutants.
The BLASTX results allowed us to reinforce the results of our pre- dictions.
An example is given for RPS2.
RPS2 is a very well- known NBS-LRR resistance protein that mediates resistance to strains of Pseudomonas syringae expressing the avirulence protein avrRpt2 [28].
We identiﬁed important genes that are related to plant immunity among the top 10 partners for this particular R gene.
These include ACOS5, transcription factor DREB1A and AT1G61190, an NBS-LRR-coding gene.
ACOS5 is a protein carrier involved in the reinforcement of the cell wall and in vesicular trafﬁcking [29].
Vesicular trafﬁck- ing is proposed to transport speciﬁc enzymes involved in the production of compounds such as 1,3 b-glucans to reinforce the cell wall and prevent colonization by the pathogen [29,30].
In addition, DREB1A is involved in the response to dehydration and in the response of Arabidopsis to Hyalopero- nospora arabidopsidis [31], indicating that this protein plays a  role in responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses.
In addi- tion, AT1G61190, an NBS-LRR-coding gene was also among the top 10 partners of RPS2, suggesting a network connection between proteins of this large class of resistance proteins.
Analysis of predicted relationships in cassava  We analyzed the predicted IRGs in cassava to identify their roles in defense.
In particular, we analyzed the gene RXam2 (cassava4.1_031234 m), which is an NBS-LRR gene that colo- calizes with a quantitative trade loci (QTL) associated with resistance to Xanthomonas axonopodis pv manihotis [32,33].
RXam2 was predicted to be associated with a serine-threonine protein kinase (cassava4.1_027765), an NAD-dependent epi- merase (cassava4.1_023284) and a transcription factor (cas- sava4.1_014914).
Associations with this type of gene were commonly found for known immunity genes in Arabidopsis.
Six of the Arabidopsis partners analyzed in detail were associ- ated with transcription factors and serine threonine kinases, and among them, CLAVATA was associated with an NAD- dependent epimerase.
These interactions suggest that RXam2   350  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 345 353  could be involved in pathways in cassava that are similar to those in Arabidopsis (Supplementary File 3).
Discussion  We were able to gather a large amount of genomic and post- genomic information from public and private databases on both Arabidopsis and cassava, with each dataset represented as a kernel matrix to apply KCCA.
In the newly-projected space, we calculated relationships between IRGs and other genes to predict a potential IRG network.
We showed, after a functional analysis, that these relationships are useful as a starting point to predict potential IRGs or genes coding for proteins strongly related to immune processes in both plant species.
The quality of genomic information depends primarily on genome annotation and the connection of this information to other databases, including literature data.
The data on the model plant Arabidopsis are much more reliable than the data on cassava due to more genomic data available and better gen- ome annotation.
The quality of predictions and the ability to interpret them biologically also depends on the quality of the data.
The level of conﬁdence in the predictions, independent of the estimated statistical error, is higher for Arabidopsis.
Pre- dictions for Arabidopsis can be veriﬁed and explored to gener- ate biological hypotheses for validation, although predictions for cassava should be taken more cautiously.
Nevertheless, the predictions and ﬁndings for cassava are very valuable be- cause they constitute one of the ﬁrst predictions for this plant species.
The quantity of data is often directly proportional to the amount of redundancy found in the databases [17], which can be observed in the preliminary cluster analysis and PCA.
In both cases, the original variables were reduced more efﬁciently for Arabidopsis than for cassava, suggesting that variables of Arabidopsis are more correlated.
In the PCA we found that microarray and RNA-seq data behave orthogonally, meaning that, for the same genes, the gene expression levels measured using these two techniques are different.
Although very few RNA-seq experiments were used, this result could indicate that these gene expression measurements are indeed complementary and do not contain the same type of information.
RNA-seq is a novel strategy to obtain information about gene expression, and although not much information has been generated by this strategy, some data suggest that there is not a direct relationship be- tween the data from microarrays and the data from RNA- seq.
The percentage of information obtained by the linear PCA was more or less maintained in the KCCA, where RNA-seq was calibrated to a weight of 0.01, in contrast to the microarray data, which had a weight of 0.6.
The applied procedure suggests that the reconstruction of biological net- works is successful when data from different sources are used but it is important to weigh the importance of each variable.
We investigated the importance of the reference category by conducting predictions based on a random reference category.
We obtained  61% of correct predictions (Table 1) when the random reference was used in Arabidopsis.
Accordingly, the predictions are almost random and less accurate when a ran- dom category is used.
Other studies [15,16,27] have shown that the accuracy of functional predictions is relatively high.
For example a rice network proposed by Lee and colleagues [16] allowed the pre- diction of 14 genes involved in XA21-mediated immunity, and 3 of which were in fact validated biologically to be important for plant defense against Xanthomonasoryzae pv.
oryzae.
Here we obtained a prediction precision of ﬁve new genes among the top 50 candidates for each biological process.
For Arabidopsis, a pathogen stress network modeled by Atias et al.
[27] was the- oretically validated through GO enrichment and a cluster was revealed, in which 8 of 45 genes were associated with the   re- sponse to biotic stimulus   and   defense response   GO terms.
Additionally, Mukhtar et al.
[15] experimentally validated 9 of 18 proteins predicted to be targets of effectors from two patho- gens for Arabidopsis.
Although our strategy was different, we expect that a relatively high percentage of the predicted genes in this study are most likely important in plant immunity.
The overall shape and topological features of the obtained IRG networks were different between Arabidopsis and cassava.
The average number of interactions between IRGs was higher in Arabidopsis than in cassava (Table 2).
Furthermore, in Ara- bidopsis, a higher global clustering coefﬁcient of IRGs was ob- served (Figure 3C and D).
These data could have a biological meaning suggesting that genes involved in immune processes are a much more deﬁned group in Arabidopsis and other cellu- lar functions (i.e., metabolic functions) are less involved in im- mune processes in Arabidopsis than in cassava.
Thus, in cassava, the IRGs seem to be connected with more non-IRGs.
Nevertheless, this conclusion needs to be used with caution, since it could be due to the lack of information on non-IRGs in cassava.
Some summary statistics were calculated when each IRG was removed from the network (Figure 3).
The relatively fewer negative peaks for degree of nodes are an indicative that Ara- bidopsis network seems to have fewer hubs than cassava net- work, while IRGs from Arabidopsis appear to be better clustered than in cassava as shown by the higher clustering coefﬁcient.
Again, biological explanations of these topological differences should be taken cautiously.
Effector proteins are directed to hubs of plant immunity networks [15].
Conse- quently, an interpretation is that Arabidopsis network has few- er hubs but removing of them as is done using the tolerance algorithm does not obviously affect the overall connectivity.
Thus, the immunity network in Arabidopsis might be consid- ered as a robust or tolerant network against attacks, where other IRGs can be imputed the same functional relationships of those IRGs suppressed.
On the other hand, the clustering coefﬁcient of the cassava network is reduced when IRGs are removed.
Therefore, immunity processes in cassava could be more vulnerable to be fragmented when hubs are preferentially attacked.
In-depth analysis of for 12 well-known IRGs and their pre- dicted interaction partners in Arabidopsis yielded interesting ﬁndings.
Our results indicate that strong relationships between IRGs exist and that other cellular processes are also strongly related to immunity.
Partners either well documented or pro- posed in previous co-expression studies were veriﬁed by our predictions.
The putative functions of some partners were rec- ognized inside the immune pathway based on BLASTX searches and biological annotations.
The methodology applied in this study allowed constructing networks which would be useful for functional prediction in   Leal LG et al / Data-mining for Prediction of Plant Immunity Genes  351  Arabidopsis and cassava.
Although the data quality was very different from the beginning, predictions in both species would facilitate generating new biological hypotheses for further investigation.
Materials and methods  Construction of genomic datasets  A reference dataset of IRGs was constructed with the genes coding for canonical immune protein domains (WRKY, TIR, NBS, kinase and LysM).
These domains were downloaded from Pfam [34] and searched in the proteomes of Arabidopsis and cassava.
HMM search [35] was used to examine the occurrence of these domains using an e-value of 1E-10 and the default parameters [36].
The reference data- set for Arabidopsis was complemented with a graph of 119 IRGs extracted from BAR (http://bar.utoronto.ca/welco- me.htm).
To test the reliability of the reference dataset, we constructed a random reference dataset by randomly assign- ing genes to ﬁve non-sense categories (emulating ﬁve types of IRGs).
Other genomic datasets were obtained as follows.
Catego- ries obtained from KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) were used to construct a dataset indicating the participation of a gene product in all metabolic categories from this data- base.
The cellular localization of the proteins was assessed by searching the proteomes of Arabidopsis and cassava for sig- nal peptides using the program TargetP, including ChloroP and SignalP [37].
The assigned GO ID (gene ontology), KOG ID (eukaryotic orthologous groups) and PfamID (protein families) for proteins of both species were queried using a BioMart tool accessible from the Phytozome project version 7.0 (http://www.phytozome.net).
GO annotations for cassava are not currently available.
Data for experimentally from Arabidopsis were validated miRNA target genes obtained from the MPSS Arabidopsis PARE Database [38].
Target genes for the identiﬁed miRNAs in cassava were obtained from predictions made by Pe  rez-Quintero and colleagues [39].
Sequences up to 1000 nucleotides upstream of each identiﬁed cassava and Arabidopsis gene was extracted from the Phytozome database v7.0 (www.phytozome.net) for identiﬁcation of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) as described by Megraw and Hatzigeorgiou [40] using Java scripts.
Construction of post-genomic datasets  The Arabidopsis microarray dataset related to pathogen resis- tance was obtained by downloading GEO datasets, which are publicly available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
In addition, genes present in these datasets were assessed with the TAIR gene annotation (also publicly available at http:// www.arabidopsis.org).
A total of 51 datasets related to patho- gen resistance were collected for analysis (see Supplementary File 3).
The cassava microarray dataset was obtained from a previous study [41].
The RNA-seq data for Arabidopsis were generated at the Ohio State University using libraries obtained from Arabid- opsis plants (wild-type Col-0 (C) and the R-gene mutant  (rps4 1)).
Plants were either hand-inoculated with Pseudo- monas syringae pv phaseolicola strain NPS3121, which ex- presses the AvrRps4 resistance protein recognized by RPS4, at 1   108 CFU/mL [42] or mock inoculated and plant stem tissues were collected at three different time points post-inoculation (6, 12 and 24 h).
RNA-seq data for cassava were generated by the Manihot Biotech re- search group at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (Mun  oz et al., unpublished) using libraries obtained from cassava leaf tissues inoculated with Xanthomonas axonopo- dis pv manihotis (Xam) or a Xam strain lacking the TAL effector, TALEXam1.
The quality of RNA-seq libraries was evaluated using Fast- QC and in-house Perl (http://www.bioinformat- ics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).
Reads were unpaired and 50 bp in length.
Adapters and reads containing   N  s were removed.
Reads with more than 50% of their bases having Phred scores lower than 30 were also removed.
scripts  Sequencing reads were mapped onto coding sequences from the respective plant genome obtained from Phytozome v7.0 (www.phytozome.net) using seq-map [43] with no mismatches, and the ﬁnal expression values (RPKM) for each gene were ob- tained using R-seq with default parameters [44].
RPKM values were used for the network.
Data preprocessing  Microarray and RNA-seq RPKM data were normalized using the R [45] vsn library through the glog transformation pro- posed by Huber [46].
Kernel canonical correlation analysis  Kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) uses kernels (similarity matrices between objects, here genes) for each type of data to conduct a regularized canonical correlation analysis [5].
We used polynomial kernels for categorical data, Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels for continuous data and diffusion kernels for graphs as described previously [4,6].
The sigma parameters for the RBF kernel, regularization for the diffusion kernel and degree for the polynomial kernel were obtained by leave-one-out cross validation following Yamani- shi et al.
[6] (Tables S1 S3).
To combine genomic data, we fused kernels by weighted  addition [6]: K ¼ w1K1 þ w2K2 þ ::: þ wiKi  ð1Þ where Ki denotes the kernel and wi denotes the weight of each kernel.
The weights must add up to 1 to preserve the value on the diagonal of the ﬁnal kernel.
KCCA was conducted and their parameters were obtained by cross validation (Tables S3, S4 and S5).
We calculated dis- tances between genes in the new space obtained by KCCA.
Gene   predictions   were retained when they were under a cho- sen distance threshold, which was calculated as the 25% of the maximum distance between IRGs (Table 1).
A theoretical percentage of correct predictions was calcu- lated with the KCCA results (Table 1).
The percentage re- ﬂects how closer the IRGs in the new space are.
Therefore, a high percentage is an indicative that KCCA accurately   352  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 345 353  reconstructs the functional relationships between IRGs.
The percentage was calculated as follows.
(i) The distances be- tween genes were arranged in increasing order and ranked.
For example, if 100 genes (30 IRGs and 70 other genes) were projected in the new space, we calculated and ordered the 10,000 distances between them.
(ii) A rank threshold for IRGs distances was assessed.
For example, 900 distances were obtained if 30 IRGs were projected and thus, the rank threshold is 900 in this example.
(iii) The distances between IRGs that were under the threshold rank were considered correct.
For example, if only 90 distances between IRGs were found under the rank of 900, we concluded that 10% of the predictions were correct.
All of the IRGs and their partners under the chosen dis- tance threshold (Table 1) were assumed to be part of a net- work.
Genes were represented by nodes, which were joined by edges.
These edges were obtained by using the KCCA.
The network was described by an adjacency matrix A:  A ¼ ðau vÞ ð2Þ where u and v are two genes, and au,v = 1 if and only if u and v are joined by a prediction  in other cases, au,v = 0.
From the adjacency matrix, the average node degree was  analyses of networks and the GO enrichment analyses analysis and contributed equally to all the mentioned steps.

The global clustering coefﬁcient (CC) was used to deter- mine how many IRGs are clustered together based on IRG triplets:  CC ¼ 3   nD  nIRG  ðnIRG 1Þ  2  ð4Þ  where nIRG is the number of IRGs and nD is the number of triplets formed only by IRGs.
To determine whether the cassava network had features the Arabidopsis network, a singular similar to that of enrichment analysis (SEA, Fisher s exact test, P   0.005) was performed to identify overrepresented GO terms in the sets of genes related to resistance in the genome using AgriGo [19].
Through a bibliographic search using PubMed,  the functions of 12 well-known IRGs and their 10 closest partners were established.
In addition, a search for co-expression networks in the public Arabidopsis databases ATTED-II [48], CoEXpression [27] and GeneCat [49] was carried out.
A BLASTX search of the ﬁrst 10 predicted partners was performed.
