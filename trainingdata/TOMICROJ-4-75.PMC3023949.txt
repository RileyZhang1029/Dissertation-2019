Abstract:  Mammalian  electron  transfer  flavoproteins  comprise  a  mitochondrial  matrix  heterodimer,  and  an  electron  
transfer  flavoprotein  dehydrogenase  localized  in  the  mitochondrial  inner  membrane.  Electrons  from  primary  acyl-CoA 
dehydrogenases, of mitochondrial metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids, are transferred to the matricial heterodimer 
and,  subsequently,  to  the  electron  transfer  flavoprotein  dehydrogenase,  which  transfers  electrons  to  ubiquinone  of  the  
mitochondrial  electron  transport  chain.  Several  evidences  suggest  that  these  proteins  may  convey  electrons  directly  to  
molecular  oxygen,  yielding  reactive  oxygen  species.  In  this  work,  we  investigated  phenotypes  of  the  yeast  mutants  
affected  in  the  orthologous  genes  of  the  matrix  heterodimer  (AIM45  and  YGR207c/CIR1)  and  of  the  electron  transfer  
flavoprotein  dehydrogenase  (YOR356w/CIR2).  The  mutant  strains aim45  and  yor356w/cir2  displayed  better  growth  on 
several non-fermentable carbon sources, which depended on the component of the electron transport chain that accepts the 
electrons resulting from its mitochondrial oxidation. Furthermore, upon heat shock, the mutant strains presented decreased 
intracellular  oxidation,  suggesting  that  these  flavoproteins  are  a  source  of  reactive  oxygen  species.  Other  phenotypes  
identified suggest that AIM45, YGR207c/CIR1 and YOR356w/CIR2 can protect cells from oxidative and heat stress, which 
encompass increased heat stress sensitivity, superoxide sensitivity, both only on non-fermentable carbon sources. 

Keywords: Electron transfer flavoproteins (ETF), mitochondrion, intracellular oxidation under stress conditions.  

INTRODUCTION 

  Mitochondria  are  essential  organelles;  they  perform  fun-
damental functions in the energetic metabolism by providing 
ATP  for  energy-requiring  cellular  processes,  in  the  anabo-
lism of amino acids,  and even in programmed cell death. To 
understand  how  the  organelle  functions  we  need  to  deter-
mine  the  function  of  all  its  proteins,  which  are  encoded  by 
the  nuclear  and  the  mitochondrial  genomes.  The  simple  eu-
karyotic  organism  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  has  been 
proven  to  be  a  fundamental  model  for  the  research  of  many 
aspects  of  cell  biology,  including  the  study  of  mitochondria 
at  physiological,  genetic  and  molecular  levels.  In  fact,  most 
of  its  mitochondrial  proteins  are  similar  to  those  found  in 
human  mitochondria  but  investigation  on  yeast  mitochon-
drial proteome has shown  the  existence of proteins with un-
known  function  [1,  2].  It  is  the  case  of  the  putative  electron 
transfer  flavoprotein  (ETF)  and  the  electron  transfer  flavo-
protein  dehydrogenase  (ETF-dH),  where  the  corresponding 
genes  are  still  functionally  unknown,  in  contrast  with  the 
human orthologs [3]. 

In  mammals,  the  ETF  is  a  heterodimer  composed  of 
 
subunits ETF(cid:1) and ETF(cid:2), involved in electron transfer from 
primary  acyl-CoA  dehydrogenases  to  ETF-dehydrogenase 
(ETF-dH),  associated  to  the  mitochondrial  inner  membrane,

which  transfers  electrons  to  ubiquinone  (CoQ)  of  the  mito-
chondrial  electron  transport  chain  (ETC).  Electron-donor 
metabolic  reactions  in  which  acyl-CoA  dehydrogenases  are 
catalysts  are  (cid:2)-oxidation,  amino acid catabolism [4],  choline 
catabolism [5] and sarcosine and dimethylglycine catabolism 
[6].  In  the  case  of  (cid:2)-oxidation,  ETF  and  ETF-dH  transfer 
electrons  from  the  first  reaction  catalyzed  by  acyl-CoA  de-
hydrogenases  (with  specificity  of  action  depending  on  the 
length  of  the  fatty  acid)  to  CoQ  [7].  The  ETF  heterodimer 
becomes  reduced  (ETFH2)  and  transfers  electrons  to  the 
mitochondrial  inner  membrane-bound  ETF-dH  that,  in  turn, 
becomes  reduced  and  able  to  transfer  electrons  to  CoQ.  In 
the  catabolism  of  the  amino  acids  lysine,  hydroxylysine  and 
tryptophan,  reports  have  suggested  that  ETF  is  coupled  to 
oxidative  decarboxylation  of  glutaric  acid,  catalyzed  by  the 
flavo-enzyme  glutarylCoA  dehydrogenase,  in  the  metabolic 
pathway leading to acetyl-CoA [6, 4].  For the  catabolism of 
the  amino  acids  leucine  and  valine/isoleucine,  acyl-CoA  de-
hydrogenases  catalyzing  one  reaction  in  leucine  oxidation 
(isovaleryl-  CoA  dehydrogenase)  and  valine/isoleucine  oxi-
dation  are  known  to  transfer  electrons  to  ETF  [8].  Choline 
catabolism  involves  conversion  to  glycine  betaine  through 
two  dehydrogenation  reactions  catalyzed  by  mitochondrial 
choline  oxidase,  which,  subsequently  transfer  electrons  to 
ETF [9]. Catabolism of sarcosine and dimethylglycine is also 
coupled to the mitochondrial electron transport system by the 
transfer  of  electrons  from,  respectively,  the  flavo-enzymes 
sarcosine  dehydrogenase  and  dimethylglycine  dehydro-
genase to the ETF [6].

  The  dehydrogenation  of  the  heterodimer  ETFH2  to 
ETFH  and  ETF  is  catalyzed  by  ETF-dH  and  the  rate  of  this 
reaction  is  decreased  by  mutations  in  ETF(cid:1).  This  causes  a 
decrease  in  the  rate  of  reduction  of  CoQ  and  (cid:2)-oxidation 
impairment.  These  mutations,  together  with  mutations  in 
ETF(cid:2) and ETF-dH have been demonstrated to cause the dis-
ease  glutaric  aciduria  type  II  [10].  In  mammalian  cells,  (cid:2)-
oxidation takes place in both mitochondria and peroxisomes, 
depending  on  fatty  acid  length  and  number  and  position  of 
double  bonds.  Indirect  evidence  suggests  the  existence  of  a 
(cid:2)-oxidation  metabolon  in  mitochondria  [11],  associating  (cid:2)-
oxidation enzymes together and with other proteins like ETF 
and ETF-dH. On  the other hand,  in yeast, (cid:2)-oxidation  is ex-
clusively  peroxisomal  and,  hence,  not  directly  coupled  to 
ATP  generation.  The  yeast  orthologues  of  ETF(cid:1),  ETF(cid:2)  and 
ETF-dH  were  reported  to  be  mitochondrial  proteins  [12,  1] 
and  are  encoded  by,  respectively,  AIM45,  YGR207c/CIR1 
and  YOR356w/CIR2.  Several  evidence  suggest  that  yeast 
ETF  and  ETF-dH  could  play  additional  roles  in  mitochon-
drial  metabolism.  In  an  approach  involving  analysis  of  
yeast  cell  extracts  by  two-dimensional  electrophoresis  and 
identification  by  mass  spectrometry,  it  was  proposed  that 
Ypr004c/Aim45 and Yor356w/Cir2 are associated in a mito-
chondrial  dehydrogenases  supramolecular  complex  [12]. 
This  complex  associates  mitochondrial  dehydrogenases  of 
the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, dehydrogenases bound to 
the  mitochondrial  inner  membrane  involved  in  oxidation  of 
NADH and glycerol 3-phosphate and the aldehyde dehydro-
genase  of  ethanol  metabolism.  Furthermore,  genetic  interac-
tion  of YPR004c/AIM45  with SDH1,  encoding  succinate  de-
hydrogenase,  suggests  yeasts  may  use  both  succinate  dehy-
drogenase  and  ETF  with  ETF-dH  to  convey  electrons  to 
ubiquinone  [13].  Interestingly,  macromolecular  complexes 
involving ETF and ETF-dH have been reported in mammal-
ian  cells  [14].  These  complexes  associate  ETF  and  ETF-dH 
with  ubiquinone,  complex  III  and  succinate  dehydrogenase 
or  medium-chain  acyl-CoA  dehydrogenase.  Another  physi-
cal  interaction  involves  Ypr004c/Aim45  and  Ygr207c/Cir1 
with  frataxin,  a  protein  involved  in  mitochondrial  iron  ho-
meostasis  and  in  mitochondrial  energy  conversion  and  oxi-
dative  phosphorylation  [15].  Together,  these  results  point  to 
an  activity  of  ETF  and  ETF-dH  close  to  succinate  dehydro-
genase  complex  and  frataxin  in  transferring  electrons  to 
ubiquinone [13]. 

  The  close  interaction  of  ETF  and  ETF-dH  with  mito-
chondrial  dehydrogenases  and  their  role  in  electron  transfer 
from  metabolic  reactions  to  the  ETC,  suggest  that  they  can 
be part of the oxidative stress response and to be a source of 
reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  under  impairment  of  mito-
chondrial  function.  In  this  study,  we  used  aim45,  ygr207c/ 
cir1 and yor356w/cir2 mutants to assess the growth perform-
ance,  intracellular  redox  state  and  oxidative  and  heat  stress 
sensitivity  to  show  that  the  yeast  putative  ETF  and  ETF-dH 
can  be  a  source  of  reactive  oxygen  species  and  can  partici-
pate  in  the  cellular  response  against  oxidative  stress  under 
stress conditions.

CIR2  are  hereafter  referred  as  aim45,  ygr207c/cir1  and 
yor356w/cir2, respectively. For all experiments, strains were 
grown on YPD (yeast extract, 1% w/v; peptone, 2% w/v and 
glucose,  2%  w/v),  YNBDUra-  (yeast  nitrogen  base,  0.67% 
w/v;  glucose,  2%  w/v;  and  auxotrophic  requirements,  40mg

nose, 2% w/v; and auxotrophic requirements, 40 mg mL-1) at 
30ºC or 39ºC, 200r.p.m. and monitored for growth spectrofo-
tometrically  at  600nm.  For  growth  plate  assays,  cells  were 
grown  overnight  on  YPD,  diluted  to  OD600=1,  serially  di-
luted  with  sterilized  deionized  water  and  3μL  of  each  dilu-
tion  were  spotted  on  each  culture  medium.  Media  tested 
were  based  on  YPD  supplemented  with  agar  (2%  w/v)  and 
replacement of the carbon source by ethanol (YPEth), acetate 
(YPAcet),  lactate  (YPLact),  pyruvate  (YPPyr),  malate  (YP-
Mal) and succinate (YPSucc), all  at 2% (w/v) concentration, 
and  methanol  (YPMeth)  at  0.5%  (v/v).  For  oxidative  stress 
resistance  tests,  3.5mM  hydrogen  peroxide  or  0.025mM  
menadione  sodium  bisulfite  were  added  to  YPD  or  YPEth.

Oxidative Fluorescence 

  The  methodology  for  intracellular  oxidation  measure-
ment  was  based  on  the  method  described  previously  [17]. 
Briefly,  cells  were  grown  overnight  on  YPD,  centrifuged  to 
discard the medium, resuspended in fresh YPD to OD600=0.1 
and  incubated  under  the  same  conditions  to  allow  further 
growth  for  two  generations.  For  each  assay,  20mL  of  this 
culture  were  further  incubated  with  the  oxidant-sensitive 
probe  2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein  diacetate  (H2DCFDA, 
50μM  final  concentration)  for  60  minutes  at  30ºC  and 
200r.p.m.,  to  load  the  cells  with  the  fluorochrome.  Cells 
were  washed  twice  with  ice-cold  50mM  phosphate  buffer, 
pH6.0  and  resuspended  in  1mL  of  the  same  buffer  in  a 
1.5mL microtube. Subsequently, cells were heat shocked in a 
water bath at 50ºC for 30 minutes and immediately placed on 
ice  before  further  manipulation.  Then,  cells  were  washed 
twice  with  ice-cold  phosphate  buffer,  mixed  with  an  equal 
volume  of  glass  beads  (0.5mm  diameter),  resuspended  on 
500μL  of  the  same  buffer  and  disrupted  by  vortexing  for  1 
minute 5 times with 1 minute interval on ice. Cell debris and 
glass  beads  were  sedimented  by  centrifugation  and  the  su-
pernatant  was  collected  and  maintained  on  ice  until  fluores-
cence  measurement. Fluorescence  measurements were made 
in  200μL  of  cell-free  extract  mixed  with  2mL  phosphate 
buffer  using  a  Perkin-Elmer  LS-50  spectrofluorimeter  with 
excitation wavelength at 504nm and emission wavelength at 
524nm.  Fluorescence  values  were  divided  by  the  total  pro-
tein of each supernatant determined with the Bio-Rad Protein 
Assay kit.

Plasmid Construction and S. cerevisiae Transformation 

Plasmid  Pro41  containing  a  gene  fusion  encoding  the  
 
green  fluorescent  protein  (GFP)  fused  in  frame  with  the  
peroxisome-targeting  sequence  serine-lysine-leucine  (GFP: 
skl) in  its  C-terminal end  and the auxotrophic marker URA3  
was  constructed  from  plasmid  Pca41,  kindly  supplied  by  
Ronald  Wanders  [18].  The  centromeric  Pca41  plasmid  
contains  the  mentioned  construct  downstream  the  catalase  
(CTA1)  promoter  and,  additionally,  a  TRP1  auxotrophic  
marker.  In  order  to  be  able  to  select  transformants  and  to  
maintain  the  plasmid  in  the  strains  used  in  this  study,  the  
TRP1  marker  was  replaced  by  the URA3  marker  as  follows.  
A  ligation  reaction  was  set  up  with  the  products  of  Pca41  
double  digestion  with  BglI  and  BglII  (yielding  a  BglI-BglI  
3550-bp  fragment  containing  the  3’  end  of ampR,  the CTA1  
promoter,  the  insert  GFP:skl  and  the  5’  end  of lacZ;  a BglI- 
BglII  fragment  of  1736-bp  containing  the  5’  end  of  ampR,  
the TRP1 marker and part of the ARS1 sequence; and a BglII- 
BglI  fragment  of  1550-bp  containing  part  of  the  ARS1  
sequence and the 3’ end of lacZ) and of the YCplac33 diges- 
tion  with  BglI  (yielding  a  1568-bp  fragment  containing  
the  3’  end  of  ampR  and  the  5’  end  of  lacZ  and  a  4035-bp  
fragment  containing  the  5’  end  of ampR,  the URA3  marker,  
the  ARS1  sequence  and  the  3’  end  of  lacZ).  After  E.  coli  
transformation  with  the  reaction  mixture,  colonies  were  
screened  for  Pro41  plasmid  yielding  BglI-BglI  3550-bp,  
BglI-BglII  2485-bp  and  BglII-BglI  1550-bp  fragments  upon  
BglI and BglII double digestion. After selection of the E. coli  
transformant  harboring  the  correct  plasmid,  plasmid  DNA  
was  purified  by  the  alkaline  lysis  method  and  DNA  was  
kept  at  4ºC  until  use.  Ligation  reactions,  restriction  enzyme  
digestion  reactions,  E.  coli  transformation  and  plasmid  
extraction  were  performed  according  to  manufacturer’s  
instructions and to standard protocols [19]. 

Peroxisome Proliferation 

Plasmid  Pro41  was  used  to  transform  BY4741,  aim45, 
 
ygr207c/cir1 and yor356w/cir2 strains by the lithium acetate 
method  [19].  Cells  were  plated  on  minimal  medium  with 
auxotrophic  requirements  except  uracil  (YNBDUra-)  to  se-
lect  transformants.  For  each  strain,  three  independent  trans-
formants  were  isolated,  grown  on  methanol  as  sole  carbon 
and energy source and checked for GFP fluorescence with a 
Leica Microsystems DM fluorescence microscope. The pres-
ence  of  punctuated  green  fluorescence  inside  the  cells  was 
indicative  of  the  presence  of  peroxisomes,  successful  trans-
formation  with  the  Pro41  plasmid  and  expression  of  the 
GFP:skl  reporter.  For  peroxisome  proliferation  experiments, 
cells were grown overnight on YNBDUra- (30ºC, 200r.p.m.),  
washed  once  with  sterilized  deionized  water,  resuspended  
in  the  same  volume  of  fresh  YNBDUra-  or  YNBMethUra-  
media  and  incubated  for  4h  or  6h,  respectively,  at  the  same  
conditions  (YNBMethUra-  and  YNBDUra-)  or  at  39ºC,  
200r.p.m. (YNBDUra-) before observation. For antimycin A  
induction  of  peroxisome  proliferation,  cells  were  grown  
overnight  on  YNBRUra-  at  30ºC,  200r.p.m.,  antimycin  A  
was  added  at  1μg  mL-1  final  concentration  and,  after  28h  
incubation,  cells  were  observed.  For  fluorescence  micros- 
copy observation, an aliquot of the culture was used and the  
number  of  cells  with  punctuated  fluorescence  was  recorded.  
A  minimum  of  100  cells  was  counted  and  results  were  

expressed as percentage of cells with peroxisomes referred to 
the total number of cells. 

Statistical Analysis 

  Data  are  expressed  as  mean  values  ±SD  of  at  least  three 
independent  assays.  Values  were  compared  by  t  test  and  
p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. 

RESULTS 

in  AIM45,  YGR207c/CIR1  and 
Mutants  Affected 
YOR356w/CIR2  Display  Higher  Growth  Rate  on  Non-
fermentable Carbon Sources 

  Alignment  of  the  predicted  amino  acid  sequences  of 
Aim45, Ygr207c/Cir1 and Yor356w/Cir2 with human ETF(cid:1), 
ETF(cid:2)  and  ETF-dH,  respectively,  shows  significant  homol-
ogy,  the  identity  ranging  from  46%  in  Ygr207c/Cir1  and 
ETF(cid:2)  to  50%  in  Aim45  and  ETF(cid:1)  and  52%  in  Yor356w/ 
Cir2 and ETF-dH. This homology might correspond to simi-
lar  functions  in  yeast  cells,  however,  fundamental  differ-
ences  between  mitochondria  from  mammalians  and  yeasts, 
like  the  absence  of  (cid:2)-oxidation  in  yeast  mitochondria,  sug-
gest that these proteins could have other functions. As a first 
approach,  we  investigated  the  growth  performance  of  the 
mutant  strains  on  glucose  and  on  different  non-fermentable 
carbon  sources,  including  metabolites  that  feed  electrons  to 
the mitochondrial external NADH dehydrogenases Nde1 and 
Nde2  (ethanol,  pyruvate  and  acetate),  the  mitochondrial  in-
ternal  NADH  dehydrogenase  Ndi1  (ethanol,  pyruvate,  lac-
tate,  malate  and,  indirectly,  fumarate),  complex  II  from  the 
electron transport chain (ETC) (succinate) and a peroxisome-
metabolizable  substrate  (methanol)  (Fig.  1).  Generally,  mu-
tants  affected  in  AIM45  and  YOR356w/CIR2  were  the  best 
growth-performing  strains  on  substrates  that  feed  electrons 
to  the  ETC  (all  substrates  except  methanol).  The  ygr207c/ 
cir1  mutant displayed  clear better growth than the wild  type 
only  on  fumarate,  a  substrate  that  feeds  electrons  to  the  
internal  NADH  dehydrogenase.  Besides  pyruvate,  malate 
and  lactate,  this  substrate  conveys  electrons  exclusively  
to  this  dehydrogenase,  which  is  not  the  case  for  ethanol. 
Only  the  yor356w/cir2  mutant  grew  better  than  the  other 
strains  when  methanol  was  used.  This  substrate  is  metabo-
lized  in  peroxisomes  yielding  dihydroxyacetone  phosphate, 
which  is  subsequently  metabolized  in  the  cytosol  and  
mitochondria. 

AIM45,  YGR207c/CIR1  and  YOR356w/CIR2  Protect 
Against Superoxide and Heat Stress Only when Cells are 
Respiring 

  The  putative 
role  of  Aim45,  Ygr207c/Cir1  and 
Yor356w/Cir2  in  electron  transfer  reactions  could  provide  a 
target for oxidative stress agents and, hence, protect cells. To 
investigate this hypothesis, we assayed all strains for growth 
in  the  presence  of  two  oxidative  agents:  hydrogen  peroxide 
and menadione, a superoxide-generating compound (Fig. 2). 
Growth on glucose was similar in all strains under all condi-
tions.  In  the  presence  of  hydrogen  peroxide,  the  growth  dif-
ferences  between  the  four  strains  tested  have  remained  con-
stant when  compared with growth on  ethanol  as sole  carbon 
and  energy  source  at  30ºC.  On  the  other  hand,  mutants  dis-
played  a  slightly  higher  sensitivity  to  menadione  on  ethanol

Fig. (1). Mutants  affected  in genes encoding ETF and ETF-dH display higher growth rate on non-fermentable  carbon sources. Cells  of the 
parental strain (BY4741) and of mutants affected in AIM45 (aim45), YGR207c/CIR1 (cir1) and YOR356w/CIR2 (cir2) were grown overnight 
and  diluted  to  OD600=1.  From  this  suspension,  3μL  of  10-1-10-5  dilutions  were  spotted  on  rich  media  containing  glucose  (YPD),  acetate 
(YPAcet), fumarate (YPFum), ethanol (YPEth), lactate (YPLact), succinate (YPSucc), pyruvate (YPPyr), malate (YPMal) or methanol (YP-
Meth)  as  sole  carbon  source.  After  48h  incubation  at  30ºC,  plates  were  photographed.  Photographs  represent  typical  results  from  at  least 
three independent experiments. 

as  sole  carbon  and  energy  source.  As  the yor356w/cir2  mu-
tant  grows  better,  on  ethanol  at  30ºC,  than  the  other  strains 
(Fig.  1),  our  results  suggest  that  this  mutant  may  be  consid-
erably more sensitive than aim45 and ygr207c/cir1 to oxida-
tive  stress  by  menadione,  when  compared  to  the  parental 
strain. It is well known that heat stress causes perturbation to 
mitochondria,  which  results  in  higher  ROS  production  [20]. 
We  wanted  to  investigate  whether  high  temperature  could 
mimic  oxidative  stress  results  by  incubating  all  strains  at 
37ºC  on  YPD  and  YPEth  (Fig.  2).  Mutant  strains  displayed 
higher sensitivity than the parental strain under 37ºC incuba-
tion  on  YPEth  in  a  similar  pattern  when  compared  to  me-
nadione  as  stress  agent  (Fig.  2),  suggesting  that  AIM45, 
YOR356w/CIR2  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  YGR207c/CIR1  are 
involved in protection against superoxide. 

Intracellular Oxidation upon Heat Shock  is Decreased  in 
aim45, ygr207c/cir1 and yor356w/cir2 Mutants 

  The  unusual  phenotype  of  better  growth  performance 
when  genes  are  deleted  (Fig.  1)  can  be  explained,  among 
other  causes,  by  affected  redox  state  in  mitochondria  during 
respiratory  metabolism,  for  instance  by  decreased  ROS  pro-
duction  in  the  mutant  strains  or  by  a  better  performance  of 
the  ETC  in  these  mutants. In  an attempt  to understand  these 
growth phenotypes and the ones of heat  and oxidative stress 
(Fig. 2) displayed by the mutant strains, we investigated the 
involvement of AIM45, YGR207c/CIR1 and YOR356w/CIR2 
in the oxidation state of the cell when mitochondria are per-
turbed by heat shock. To measure the intracellular oxidation, 
we  used  the  fluorescent  oxidant-sensitive  probe  H2DCFDA. 
This  compound  can  diffuse  freely  through  plasma  mem-

branes  to  the  cytosol  where  it  is  deacetylated  by  cellular  es-
terases,  becoming  unable  to  diffuse  through  the  plasma 
membrane.  After  loading  with  the  fluorescent  probe,  cells 
were heat-shocked by incubation at 50ºC for 30min and fluo-
rescence  was  recorded  in  the  cell  lysate.  As  expected,  upon 
heat  shock,  higher  levels  of  fluorescence  from  the  oxidized 
probe  were  measured  as  compared  to  incubation  at  30ºC, 
indicating an increase in intracellular oxidation state (Fig. 3). 
Intracellular  oxidation  is  similar  among  all  strains  at  30ºC; 
however,  after  incubation  at  50ºC,  all  mutants  presented 
nearly  half  fluorescence  in  relation  to  the  parental  strain. 
These  results  suggest  that,  upon  heat  shock  conditions, 
Aim45,  Ygr207c/Cir1  and  Yor356w/Cir2  contribute  to  the 
increase in intracellular oxidation state of yeast cells.

AIM45, 
 
YGR207c/CIR1  and  YOR356w/CIR2,  suggest  a  significant 
involvement of these genes in mitochondrial function, which 
is particularly highlighted under stress conditions. An impor-
tant adaptation to mitochondrial dysfunction is the retrograde 
regulation,  which  involves  altered  gene  expression,  metabo-
lism  and  organelle  homeostasis  [21].  One  of  the  remarkable 
adaptations is peroxisome proliferation that, together with an 
increased  expression  of  genes  encoding  enzymes  of  the 
glyoxylate  cycle  (CIT2)  and  of  first  three  reactions  of  the 
tricarboxylic  acid  cycle  (CIT1,  ACO1  and  IDH1/2),  allows 
efficient use of two carbon compounds, like ethanol and ace-
tate, and the maintenance of anabolic reactions for nitrogen-

based  compounds  like  glutamate  and  lysine.  Therefore,  we 
reasoned that the aim45, ygr207c/cir1 and yor356w/cir2 mu-
tants  could  have  an  activated  retrograde  regulation  pathway 
due  to  altered  mitochondrial  function,  particularly  under 
stress conditions. A simple method to assess this is to meas-
ure  peroxisome  proliferation  by  fluorescence  microscopy  in 
cells  expressing  GFP  fused  with  the  skl  peroxisome-
targeting  peptide  [22].  To  test  heat  stress,  we  used  a  lower 
temperature (39ºC) than the one from the intracellular oxida-
tion  assay  in  order  to  allow  survival  of  cells  long  enough  to 
induce  peroxisome  proliferation.  Under  these  conditions, 
strains  did  not  display  significant  differences.  The  strain  af-
fected  in  AIM45  presented  a  reproducible  slightly  higher 
percentage of cells with more than 2 peroxisomes suggesting 
that  this  gene  could  be  important  for  normal  functioning  of 
mitochondria under heat stress (Fig. 4A). We also tested the 
complex  III-inhibitor  antimycin  A  in  cultures  of  all  strains 
and determined the percentage of cells with peroxisome pro-
liferation  [23]  (Fig.  4B).  Only  the  ygr207c/cir1  mutant  dis-
played  statistically  significant  increased  peroxisome  prolif-
eration. These results suggest that ETF(cid:1),  ETF(cid:2)  and ETF-dH 
act  differently  upon  the  action  of  different  mitochondria-
perturbing  agents  and  that  they  may  be  important  for  mito-
chondrial function under stress conditions. This conclusion is 
supported  by  the  lack  of  difference  in  peroxisome  prolifera-
tion  between  all  strains  when  the  assay  was  performed  on 
cells  grown  on  the  peroxisome  metabolizable  substrate 
methanol in the absence of stress (not shown).

DISCUSSION 

  Mammalian  ETF  and  ETF-dH  are  fairly  well  studied, 
namely  their  protein  structure,  interaction  with  substrates, 
kinetics  of  electron  transfer  and  metabolism  (for  a  recent 
review  see  [3]).  Function-inactivating  mutations  cause  a 
metabolic  disorder  known  as  glutaric  aciduria  II,  character-
ized  by  a  dysfunction  in  acyl-CoA  dehydrogenases  of  fatty 
acids,  amino  acids  metabolism  and  renal  excretion  of  glu-
taric  and  lactic  acids.  The  yeast  orthologs  are  still  poorly 
characterized.  Several  observations  suggest  that  yeast  ETF 
and  ETF-dH  orthologs  may  have  additional  roles  besides 
those identified for the mammalian counterparts: (cid:2)-oxidation 
does not take place in mitochondria, regulation of genes en-
coding mitochondrial proteins is subject to catabolite repres-
sion  by  glucose,  Ypr004c/Aim45  and  Ygr207c  interact  with 
the frataxin-homolog iron chaperone Yfh1 [13] and microar-
ray analysis indicate that the genes encoding ETF and ETF-
dH  have  altered  expression  upon  environmental  changes 
such  as  heat,  cold  and  oxidative  shocks  [24].  Our  results 
suggest  that  the  yeast  orthologous  genes  encoding  ETF(cid:1), 
ETF(cid:2) and ETF-dH are involved in cellular protection against 
superoxide  and  are  involved  in  intracellular  oxidation,  par-
ticularly under mitochondrial perturbation conditions such as 
heat shock. 

  The  better  growth  effect  on  non-fermentable  carbon 
sources by the knockout mutations on AIM45, YGR207c/CIR1 
and YOR356w/CIR2 can be explained by an indirect effect like 
less  production  of  ROS  during  respiratory  metabolism.  Our 
results  indicating  decreased  intracellular  oxidation  under heat 
shock in all mutants (Fig. 3) partially support this assumption. 
Altered  growth  rate  was  specific  according  to  mutation  and 
carbon source (Fig. 1), that is, each gene mutation only caused 
altered growth on carbon sources according to the ETC com-

30ºC for 28h (B) and cells containing more than 2 peroxisomes were counted on a fluorescence microscope. C: bright field and GFP fluores-

ponent  functioning  as  acceptor  of  electrons.  This  could  be  a 
consequence  of  the  spatial  arrangement  of  mitochondrial  de-
hydrogenases in the supramolecular complexes [12]. As some 
of  these  dehydrogenases  are  TCA  cycle  enzymes,  the  su-
pramolecular  dehydrogenase  complex  could  have  a  different 
activity depending on the type of carbon source. However, in 
all cases, the increase in growth rate observed is not very pro-
nounced,  suggesting  that  the  energetic  metabolism  might  be 
unchanged  or  only  slightly  increased.  Accordingly,  oxygen 
consumption rates were nearly the same on isolated mitochon-
dria  from  each  strain  with  several  of  the  substrates  tested  in 

growth  experiments  (our  unpublished  results).  The  notion  of 
competition between dehydrogenases for oxidized ubiquinone 
has been reported [25] to explain different levels of hydrogen 
peroxide production by rat isolated mitochondria when respir-
ing  on  substrates  that  feed  electrons  to  different  ETC  com-
plexes. A similar competition between ETF and ETF-dH with 
complex  II  (succinate  dehydrogenase,  Sdh1),  the  internal 
NADH  dehydrogenase  (Ndi1)  and  the  external  NADH  
dehydrogenases  (Nde1  and  Nde2),  would  explain  the aim45, 
ygr207c/cir1 and yor356w/cir2 mutants better growth by a more 
efficient oxidation of ubiquinone by these dehydrogenases.

  Different sensitivities observed with the aim45, ygr207c/ 
cir1  and  yor356w/cir2  mutants  to  oxidative  stress  agents 
hydrogen  peroxide  and  menadione  can  be  interpreted  in 
terms  of  the  different  mechanisms  of  action  of  these  com-
pounds  in  the  cellular  context.  While  peroxide  toxicity  is 
mediated  by  the  Fenton  reaction,  which  releases  hydroxyl 
radicals  upon  reaction  with  Fe2+,  menadione  generates  the 
highly  oxidized  radical  superoxide,  which  causes  more  pro-
nounced  inhibitory  effects  on  mitochondrial  enzymes  than 
peroxide  [26].  Some  of  these  enzymes  are  dehydrogenases 
from  the  TCA  cycle  that  could  become  more  sensitive  or 
more  exposed  to  superoxide  activity  when  one  of  the  su-
pramolecular  complex  dehydrogenases  is  missing,  namely, 
Aim45, Ygr207c/Cir1 or Yor356w/Cir2. 

In the model proposed by Davidson and Schiestl [20], the 
 
cofactor  flavin  is  a  source  of  ROS,  whose  amount  depends 
on  mutations  (coq7,  affecting  ubiquinone  synthesis  and 
nde1nde2,  affecting  the  external  NADH  dehydrogenases) 
and  heat  stress.  Our  results  of  intracellular  oxidation  state 
(Fig. 3) can be explained assuming that ETF and ETF-dH are 
flavoproteins  that  contribute  to  the  bulk  of  superoxide  pro-
duction.  In  fact,  the  possibility  of  ROS  production  by  ETF 
and ETF-dH has been proposed earlier for rat skeletal muscle 
and  heart  mitochondria  respiring  on  any  substrate  [25].  In 
addition,  expression  of  AIM45  is  repressed  at  37ºC,  as  are 
the  genes  involved  in  the  synthesis  and  assembly  of  com-
plexes II, III, IV and V [27], suggesting that the ETC activity 
is  decreased,  presumably  as  an  adaptation  preventing  exces-
sive ROS production. This similar expression regulation and 
the  observed  lower  intracellular  oxidation  in  the  mutant  af-
fected in AIM45 (Fig. 3) are compatible with its involvement 
in the ETC. 
  An  association  of  YGR207c/CIR1  to  the  mitochondrial 
function  in non-physiological  conditions  is suggested by the 
peroxisome  proliferation  observed  in  the  correspondent  mu-
tants  (Fig.  4).  This  is  a  cellular  response  to  mitochondrial 
dysfunction  by  ETC  impairment  or  mitochondrial  genome 
loss,  involving  the  so-called  retrograde  pathway,  allowing 
circumventing insufficiency of mitochondrial metabolism by 
providing  nitrogen-based  compounds  precursors  of  several 
amino  acids  like  glutamate  and  lysine.  Recently,  a  model 
explaining  the  ETF  specific  interactions  with  different  pro-
teins,  in  its  role  of  electron  transfer  to  the  ETC,  has  been 
proposed,  which  differs  from  the  classical  induced  fit  inter-
action mechanism [3]. In this new proposed mechanism, the 
FAD  domain  of  ETF  becomes  mobile  upon  ETF-protein 
complex formation, allowing random motion so that, eventu-
ally,  an  optimal  geometry  is  established  leading  to  efficient 
interprotein  electron  transfer  in  a  process  called  “conforma-
tional  sampling”.  This  suggests  a  wide  interaction  of  ETF 
and ETF-dH with substrates and other dehydrogenases com-
patible  with  the  phenotypes  associated  with  the  mitochon-
drial functions of the mutants observed in this work. In addi-
tion,  a  phenotype  of  higher  frequency  of  mitochondrial  ge-
nome loss in the aim45 mutant was observed in an approach 
combining  computational  prediction  methods  with  quantita-
tive  experiments  [28].  The  induction  of  peroxisome  prolif-
eration reported in this work is in accordance with this find-
ing  and  suggests  interplay  with  mechanisms  of  genome  in-
tegrity maintenance. 

CONCLUSION 
  This work presents evidence pointing to a role of AIM45, 
CIR1  and  CIR2  in  the  redox  state  of  the  cell  under  non-
physiological  conditions.  In  addition,  results  suggest  that 
Aim45,  Cir1  and  Cir2  can  be  a  source  of  reactive  oxygen 
species  in  conditions  of  mitochondrial  perturbation,  in  par-
ticular under extreme heat stress.
