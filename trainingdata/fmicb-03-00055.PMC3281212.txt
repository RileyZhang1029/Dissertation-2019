Human immunodeﬁciency virus type-1 (HIV-1) encodes a polypeptide called Gag that is able
to form virus-like particles in vitro in the absence of any cellular or viral constituents. Dur-
ing the late phase of the HIV-1 infection, Gag polyproteins are transported to the plasma
membrane (PM) for assembly. In the past two decades, in vivo, in vitro, and structural
studies have shown that Gag trafﬁcking and targeting to the PM are orchestrated events
that are dependent on multiple factors including cellular proteins and speciﬁc membrane
lipids. The matrix (MA) domain of Gag has been the focus of these studies as it appears
to be engaged in multiple intracellular interactions that are suggested to be critical for
virus assembly and replication. The interaction between Gag and the PM is perhaps the
most understood. It is now established that the ultimate localization of Gag on punctate
sites on the PM is mediated by speciﬁc interactions between the MA domain of Gag and
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], a minor lipid localized on the inner leaﬂet
of the PM. Structure-based studies revealed that binding of PI(4,5)P2 to MA induces minor
conformational changes, leading to exposure of the myristyl (myr) group. Exposure of the
myr group is also triggered by binding of calmodulin, enhanced by factors that promote
protein self-association like the capsid domain of Gag, and is modulated by pH. Despite
the steady progress in deﬁning both the viral and cellular determinants of retroviral assem-
bly and release, Gag’s intracellular interactions and trafﬁcking to its assembly sites in the
infected cell are poorly understood. In this review, we summarize the current understanding
of the structural and functional role of MA in HIV replication.

Human immunodeﬁciency virus type-1 (HIV-1), the causative
agent of AIDS, is blamed for over 34 million deaths and is poised to
claim over two million lives a year in the absence of efﬁcient ther-
apeutic intervention (UNAIDS report 2011). HIV-1 replication is
strongly dependent on the cellular machinery to produce progeny
virus. Since its discovery, efforts have focused on the development
of effective vaccines and drugs that target different stages of the
HIV lifecycle. Combinations of drugs that target protease, reverse
transcriptase, integrase, or virus fusion form the basis of current
antiretroviral therapy (ART; Greene et al., 2008). However, the
genetic diversity and the ability of the virus to mutate to evade
drug treatment remains a threat to the future success of ART. The
discovery of cellular factors that participate in HIV-1 replication
pathways has provided new insights into the molecular basis of
virus–host cell interactions. Recent studies have identiﬁed hun-
dreds of cellular factors that are involved in HIV replication (Brass
et al., 2008; König et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2008; Jäger et al., 2011;
Lever and Jeang, 2011). Drugs that target the essential interactions
of viral factors with host-proteins have the potential to not only
complement current therapy, but may also overcome the prob-
lem of viral escape. As host-factors are stable and not diverse, the
mutational capacity of the virus that usually allows for drug escape
is thus restricted by the requirement to remain compatible to an

invariant host-factor. Elucidation of the molecular interactions
between the host cell and HIV are important for understanding
the virus replication and the subsequent cytopathogenesis in the
infected cell, which will aid in the development of more efﬁcient
antiviral drugs.

Retroviral genomes encode a polyprotein called Gag (Figure 1)
that contains all the viral elements required for virus assembly and
is capable of forming virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro in the
absence of viral and cellular constituents (Gheysen et al., 1989;
Campbell and Rein, 1999; Campbell et al., 2001a). Subsequent
to their synthesis, Gag proteins are targeted to the plasma mem-
brane (PM) for assembly and budding (Adamson and Freed, 2007;
Chu et al., 2010). During or shortly after budding, the virally
encoded protease cleaves off Gag proteins at ﬁve positions into
matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), spacer peptide 1
(SP1), spacer peptide 2 (SP2), and P6, which rearrange to form
mature and infectious virions (Figure 1; Turner and Summers,
1999; Adamson and Freed, 2007; Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2008;
Briggs and Kräusslich, 2011).

It is widely accepted that HIV-1 Gag budding and assembly
occur predominantly on the PM (Figure 1; Hermida-Matsumoto
and Resh, 2000; Jouvenet et al., 2006, 2008; Finzi et al., 2007;

Role of HIV-1 matrix in virus assembly

1999; Bouamr et al., 2003). However, pioneering NMR structural
studies by the Summers lab conﬁrmed that the myr group can
adopt sequestered [myr(s)] and exposed [myr(e)] conformations
even in the isolated MA protein (Tang et al., 2004). Equilibrium
data revealed that while myr(+)MA resides in monomer–trimer
equilibrium, the myr(−)MA protein maintains the monomeric
character in solution under all conditions (Tang et al., 2004).
In addition, exposure of the myr group is coupled with protein
trimerization (Tang et al., 2004). The myr switch was found to be
sensitive to protein concentration, which led to the proposition of
the “entropic switch mechanism” (Tang et al., 2004). Additionally,
inclusion of the CA domain increases exposure of the myr group,
which indicates that exposure of the myr group is dependent on
Gag multimerization (Tang et al., 2004). Most recently, we have
shown that myr exposure is also modulated by pH (Fledderman
et al., 2010). Since these factors (protein concentration, multimer-
ization, and pH) are intrinsically conﬁned to the MA protein, we
call them the “internal modulators.”

Gag MULTIMERIZATION, A TRIGGER FOR myr EXPOSURE AND
A REQUIREMENT FOR EFFICIENT MEMBRANE ASSOCIATION
As mentioned above, previous studies revealed that exposure of the
myr group is coupled with protein trimerization and is enhanced
by factors that promote protein self-association, such as increasing
protein concentration or inclusion of the CA domain (Tang et al.,
2004). HIV-1 Gag multimerization is directly linked to efﬁcient
membrane binding and is required for particle formation and viral
infectivity (Burniston et al., 1999; Ono et al., 2000a; Lindwasser
and Resh, 2001; Li et al., 2007). The oligomerization properties
of HIV-1 Gag, MA, and MACA constructs have been extensively
studied (Morikawa et al., 1998, 2000; Tang et al., 2004; Alfadhli
et al., 2007, 2009a,b; Dalton et al., 2007; Datta et al., 2007b; Li et al.,
2007; Saad et al., 2007a,b; Dou et al., 2009; Hogue et al., 2009). The
CA domain contains a dimerization site in the C terminus and is
known to play a central role in mediating Gag–Gag interactions
(Li et al., 2000; Joshi et al., 2006; Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2007,
2008; Wright et al., 2007; Briggs et al., 2009; Hogue et al., 2009;
Chukkapalli and Ono, 2011). Other domains such as SP1 and NC
also play important roles in Gag multimerization and assembly
(Dawson and Yu, 1998; Burniston et al., 1999; Campbell and Rein,
1999; Cimarelli et al., 2000; Morikawa et al., 2000; Muriaux et al.,
2001; Wright et al., 2007; Briggs et al., 2009). Altogether, despite
the lack of a detailed structural mechanism these ﬁndings indicate
that myr exposure is enhanced through synergistic intermolecular
interactions between Gag subdomains that cooperatively promote
assembly.

et al., 2009a; Ono, 2009, 2010). Membrane binding is mediated by
Gag’s N-terminal myristoylated MA domain [myr(+)MA; Adam-
son and Freed, 2007; Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2008; Ono, 2009;
Chukkapalli and Ono, 2011; Hamard-Peron and Muriaux, 2011].
The myristyl (myr) group functions in concert with a group
of conserved basic residues to facilitate membrane anchoring
and assembly of Gag. Mutations that either block myristoyla-
tion or disrupt the basic patch lead to inefﬁcient Gag targeting
to the PM, resulting in dramatically reduced virus production
(Bryant and Ratner, 1990; Freed et al., 1994; Spearman et al., 1997;
Hermida-Matsumoto and Resh, 2000; Ono et al., 2000b).

Role of the MA protein in HIV replication has been exten-
sively examined. In this review, we focus on the functional role of
MA in the late phase of infection. In the last few years, efforts
have been focused on the identiﬁcation of structural require-
ments that enable efﬁcient Gag-membrane association. Success
in producing the ﬁrst retroviral matrix myristoylated protein for
structural studies (Tang et al., 2004) afforded invaluable insight
into understanding speciﬁc factors that regulate the myr switch
and the potential implication in virus assembly.

INTRINSIC FACTORS THAT MODULATE THE myr SWITCH IN
HIV-1 MA
In vitro studies have established that Gag binds membranes more
efﬁciently than the isolated MA protein (Zhou and Resh, 1996;
Spearman et al., 1997; Hermida-Matsumoto and Resh, 1999; Ono
and Freed, 1999; Paillart and Gottlinger, 1999; Bouamr et al.,
2003). This led to the hypothesis that the myr group is exposed
in HIV-1 Gag and sequestered in the MA protein, which has
come to be known the “myristyl switch mechanism” (Spearman
et al., 1997; Hermida-Matsumoto and Resh, 1999; Ono and Freed,

MYRISTYL EXPOSURE IS MODULATED BY pH
One of the key characteristics of the HIV-1 myr(+)MA is the pres-
ence of the myr group in two energetically stable states: exposed
and sequestered (Tang et al., 2004). In solution, these two states are
at equilibrium. However, it seems that subtle changes in sample
conditions such as protein concentration can perturb the equilib-
rium state (Tang et al., 2004). Analysis of the HIV-1 myr(+)MA
structure revealed that the imidazole ring of His-89, which is
highly conserved among all strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian
immunodeﬁciency virus (SIV; Los Alamos National Laboratory,

Ghanam et al.

Role of HIV-1 matrix in virus assembly

http://www.hiv.lanl.gov), forms a salt bridge with Glu-12(COO−)
in HIV-1 myr(−)MA but not in the myr(+)MA protein. Histi-
dine residues play important roles in biological activity as they
are frequently included in the active sites of enzymes and con-
tribute to protein stability and function. The intrinsic pK a of
the histidine imidazole group, which varies depending on the
degree of burial or exposure within proteins (Edgcomb and Mur-
phy, 2002), typically lies between 6.0 and 7.0 (Liu et al., 1997;
Edgcomb and Murphy, 2002). Previous studies have shown that
mutation of His-89 led to targeting of Gag to intracellular com-
partments and severely reduced virus production (Freed et al.,
1994). We have recently shown that deprotonation of the His-89
imidazole ring in myr(+)MA destabilizes the salt bridge formed
between His-89(Hδ2) and Glu-12(COO−; Figure 2), leading to
tight sequestration of the myr group and a shift in the equilibrium
from trimer to monomer (Fledderman et al., 2010). By using NMR
methods, we calculated the pK a of the histidine imidazole group
in both myr(−)MA and myr(+)MA to be 6.5 (Fledderman et al.,
2010). Furthermore, we have shown that oligomerization of a Gag-
like construct containing MACA is also pH-dependent. Increasing
the pH to 8 inhibited the formation of trimers for MA and MACA
(Figure 3; Fledderman et al., 2010). These ﬁndings indicate that
trimerization of Gag in vitro, although enhanced by CA, is solely
driven by the MA domain and tightly regulated by pH. Based on
these ﬁndings, we suggested that changes in pH might have an
effect on the afﬁnity of MA and Gag binding to membranes.

Earlier studies have also shown that mutation of His-89 and
other residues in the vicinity led to targeting of Gag to intracellular
compartments and severely reduced virus production (Freed et al.,
1994). We recently found that the internal Gag puncta observed
with H89G mutation colocalized extensively with CD63, indicat-
ing multivesicular bodies (MVB) localization (Fledderman et al.,
2010). These results indicate that His-89 is essential for proper tar-
geting of Gag to the PM and efﬁcient particle formation in HeLa
cells. Structural studies have shown that substitution of His-89
destabilized the tertiary structure, triggering myr exposure, and
promoting high-order protein self-association (Fledderman et al.,
2010).

Altogether, structural studies revealed that MA acts as a “pH
sensor” and that, at least in vitro, myr exposure is regulated by
pH. A potential role of pH variations in subcellular localization
and targeting of Gag has not yet been established. Intracellular pH
often ﬂuctuates (6.3–7.8) in response to cell growth, development,
and apoptosis (Schuldiner and Rozengurt, 1982; Moolenaar et al.,
1983; Gottlieb et al., 1995). Alterations in the PM function can
also be induced by cytopathic viruses including HIV-1 (Maku-
tonina et al., 1996). A signiﬁcant decrease in pH from 7.2 to as
low as 6.0 was observed in cells infected by HIV-1 (Makutonina
et al., 1996). Despite the in vitro evidence for pH effect on the
myr switch, it has yet to be established whether manipulation of
intracellular pH can alter kinetic pathways and sites or efﬁciency
of Gag assembly.

MA RESIDUES THAT REGULATE THE myr SWITCH
MECHANISM AND/OR Gag ASSEMBLY SITES
Mutagenesis studies in the past two decades have identiﬁed sev-
eral residues in the MA domain that can alter Gag targeting and

assembly (Bryant and Ratner, 1990; Freed et al., 1994; Zhou et al.,
1994; Ono et al., 1997, 2000b; Ono and Freed, 1999, 2004; Pail-
lart and Gottlinger, 1999; Joshi et al., 2009a; Chukkapalli et al.,
2010). Several of these residues are located in the N-terminus of
MA and are considered critical for proper membrane selection
(Freed et al., 1994; Ono et al., 1997; Ono and Freed, 1999; Pail-
lart and Gottlinger, 1999). More speciﬁcally, V7R, L8A, and L8I
mutations give rise to a phenotype similar to that observed for the
unmyristoylated protein without blocking myristoylation. These
mutants, which display a hazy, non-punctate staining pattern typi-
cal of HIV-1 Gag mutants that are defective in membrane binding,
cause a signiﬁcant increase in cytosolic localization of Gag and
severely inhibit virus assembly and release (Freed et al., 1994; Ono
et al., 1997; Ono and Freed, 1999; Paillart and Gottlinger, 1999). In
order to identify the structural basis for weak membrane associa-
tion and diminished assembly of Gag V7R, L8A and L8I mutants,
NMR, and analytical centrifugation studies have been performed
on MAV7R, L8A, and L8I mutants (Saad et al., 2007b). NMR struc-
tures revealed that the backbone atoms of these mutants are very
similar to the coordinates of the wild-type MA protein, indicating
that single mutations in the N-terminal loop had no effect on the
globular fold of the protein (Saad et al., 2007b). These studies,
however, have shown that these mutations shut off the myr switch
and lead to complete sequestration of the myr group (Saad et al.,

Role of HIV-1 matrix in virus assembly

2007b). The main differences between the structures are localized
within the disordered loop formed by residues Gly-2–Ser-9. For
example, in the V7R MA structure the side chain of Arg-7 makes
a salt bridge with the side chain of Glu-52, and the methylene
groups of Arg-7 contribute to the hydrophobic interactions with
the methylene groups of the myristate (Saad et al., 2007b). For
L8A, the less bulky methyl group of Ala-8 creates a better cavity
for the myristate group, which packs closer to Trp-16. Thus, struc-
tural changes involve only residues located near the mutation site,
which may have only average intrinsic conformational mobility.
The sensitivity of the myristyl switch equilibrium to subtle mole-
cular changes is evident in the conservative substitution of Leu-8
by Ile, which is sufﬁcient to block myristate exposure under con-
ditions in which exposure is normally highly favored (Saad et al.,
2007b). Altogether, in vivo, biochemical, and structural studies
conﬁrm that even conserved structural changes in the N-terminus
of MA can lead to major effects on the myr switch, which in turn
abrogate Gag binding to the PM and inhibit virus assembly.

Interestingly, the phenotype observed for mutants in the N-
terminus is very different from that observed for mutants in the
basic domain (e.g., K30E and K32E) or between residues 85 and
89, which have been shown to associate speciﬁcally with intra-
cellular compartments like MVBs (Freed et al., 1994; Ono et al.,
1997, 2000b; Ono and Freed, 2004; Joshi et al., 2009a). While the
structural effect of K30E and K32E mutations on the myr switch is
not yet known, we predict that substitutions between residues 85
and 89 may directly perturb the myr switch equilibrium. As men-
tioned above, H89G substitution in myr(+)MA led to formation
of protein aggregates as a result of exposure of the myr group (Fled-
derman et al., 2010). Thus, it appears that sequestration or lack of
myr group favors cytosolic localization rather than MVB asso-
ciation. Although targeting of Gag K30E/K32E mutant to MVB
compartments led to severely defective virus particle production
in HeLa cells (Ono et al., 2000b; Ono and Freed, 2004), recent
evidence revealed that it can still support highly efﬁcient assem-
bly and release in T cells (Joshi et al., 2009a). It was suggested that
under some circumstances, late endosomal compartments serve as
productive sites for HIV assembly in some cell types (Joshi et al.,
2009a).

ROLE OF PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-4,5-BISPHOSPHATE
[PI(4,5)P2] IN HIV-1 Gag TARGETING, MEMBRANE BINDING,
AND VIRUS ASSEMBLY
It is well established that assembly of retroviral Gag proteins
occur predominantly on the PM (Hermida-Matsumoto and Resh,
2000; Jouvenet et al., 2006, 2008; Finzi et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007;
Welsch et al., 2007; Gousset et al., 2008; Joshi et al., 2009a; Ono,
2009, 2010). Membrane selection appears to be critical for pro-
ductive virus production. Rein and co-workers have shown that
Gag constructs assemble in vitro into VLPs with diameters sig-
niﬁcantly smaller (25–30 nm) than those of authentic particles,
whereas particles assembled in the presence of reticulocyte lysates
exhibit normal diameters (∼100 nm; Campbell et al., 2001a). Fur-
ther studies identiﬁed inositol pentaphosphate (IP5) as the active
agent that promotes normal particle morphology and is capable of
conferring resistance to disassembly in RNase, NaCl, and trypsin
assays. Other inositol phosphates and IP derivatives, including
inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) and PI(4,5)P2 (Figure 4A) had
similar inﬂuence on in vitro Gag assembly, and mutagenesis studies
suggested that they promote HIV-1 particle assembly by interact-
ing with the MA domain of Gag (Campbell et al., 2001a; Crist
et al., 2009). A Gag protein lacking residues 16–99 in its MA
domain lost the requirement for inositol phosphates in assem-
bly in vitro. Further exploration of the binding properties of IP6
to a Gag construct lacking the myr group and the p6 domain
[myr(−)GagΔp6] revealed that both MA and NC domains of
Gag contribute to IP6 binding (Datta et al., 2007b). Equilibrium
studies have shown that myr(−)GagΔp6 undergoes an equilib-
rium switch from monomer–dimer in the absence of IP6 to
monomer–trimer upon binding to IP6. However, myr(−)GagΔp6
with a mutation in the dimer interface of CA is monomeric
in the presence of IP6, suggesting that the “dimer interface” is
essential for the trimeric interaction (Datta et al., 2007b). These
ﬁndings supported by hydrodynamic and small-angle neutron
scattering (SANS) data led to the suggestion that the participa-
tion of both MA and NC domains of Gag in IP6 interaction is
evidence for a folded conformation of Gag in solution, with its
ends close to each other in the three-dimensional space (Datta
et al., 2007a).

Role of HIV-1 matrix in virus assembly

(cid:2)

HIV-1 MA and a cellular constituent, the two most intriguing
observations were the PI(4,5)P2 binding mode and the effect of
binding on the myr switch. The three-dimensional structure of the
MA-PI(4,5)P2 complex revealed that the acyl chain attached to the
(cid:2)
-position of the glycerol packs within the β-II–V cleft against the
2
side chains of Leu-21, Lys-27, Tyr-29, His-33, Trp-36, and Ser-
77, while the phosphoinositide head group packs against Leu-21
(cid:2)
-fatty acid chain (Figure 4A). The 1
and Lys-27, burying the 2
-
acyl chain, however, is exposed to solvent with PI(4,5)P2 molecule
adopting an “extended lipid” conformation. Binding of PI(4,5)P2
to MA induces a minor conformational change entailing a repo-
sitioning of helix I and destabilization of the hydrophobic cavity,
leading to myr exposure. These results indicate that PI(4,5)P2 acts
as both a trigger of the myr switch and as a membrane anchor and
suggest a potential mechanism for targeting Gag to membrane
rafts (Figure 4B; Saad et al., 2006). Interestingly, the proposed
membrane binding mode is very similar to the “extended lipid”
conformation predicted in the phospholipid–cytochrome c model
(Kinnunen et al., 1994; Rytömaa and Kinnunen, 1995; Tuominen
et al., 2002).

(basic side chains shown in blue) in a manner expected to synergistically

Studies by Freed, Ono, and co-workers thereafter have pro-
vided compelling evidence that the ultimate localization of HIV-1
Gag on the PM is critically dependent on PI(4,5)P2 (Ono et al.,
2004; Chukkapalli et al., 2008, 2010; Chukkapalli and Ono, 2011).
PI(4,5)P2 is a membrane marker for proteins that are speciﬁcally
targeted to the PM (Behnia and Munro, 2005; McLaughlin and
Murray, 2005). Depletion of PI(4,5)P2 by overexpression of 5-
phosphatase IV (5ptase IV) led to accumulation of Gag at the
membranes of late endosomes and MVBs, inhibited HIV assem-
bly, and severely reduced virus production (Ono et al., 2004).
Likewise, overexpression of a constitutively active form of Arf6
(Arf6/Q67L), which induces the formation of PI(4,5)P2-enriched
endosomal structures led to retargeting of Gag to these vesicles
and severely reduced virus production. Sensitivity of Gag local-
ization and assembly to PI(4,5)P2 manipulation was lost upon
substitution of the MA domain with the N-terminus of Fyn kinase
[Fyn(10)ΔMA/delNC], which is not affected by 5ptaseIV overex-
pression. Altogether, these ﬁndings supported the hypothesis that
interactions between MA and PI(4,5)P2 are essential for proper
Gag targeting and membrane binding.

NMR studies have been utilized to identify how MA interacts
with PI(4,5)P2 (Saad et al., 2006). NMR chemical shift pertur-
bation data obtained for the MA protein revealed that residues
Arg-22, Lys-26, Lys-27, His-33, Glu-73, Leu-75, and Ser-77 were the
most affected upon binding of soluble analogs of PI(4,5)P2 (Saad
et al., 2006). These residues reside on a cleft formed by helices
II and V, and a β hairpin (β-II-V cleft). Although these studies
marked the ﬁrst structural evidence for direct interactions between

Of particular note, our studies represent the ﬁrst evidence that
PI(4,5)P2 can adopt an extended conformation. The hydropho-
bic cleft that interacts with the 2
-acyl chain of PI(4,5)P2 analogs
with short chains (four- and eight-carbon atoms) is also capa-
ble of accommodating longer fatty acids without inducing any
major changes in the protein structure. A model of the trimeric

PI(4,5)P2:myr(+)MA–membrane complex constructed by using

(cid:2)
-acyl chains is shown in Figure 4B.
18- and 20-carbon 1
Native PI(4,5)P2 forms micelles in aqueous solution, making it vir-
tually impossible to study its interaction with MA by NMR meth-
ods (Janmey et al., 1987). Difﬁculties in characterizing the binding
of native PI(4,5)P2 with the MA protein have only been overcome
upon encapsulating the protein in reverse micelles (Valentine et al.,
2010). Titration of MA with native PI(4,5)P2 in reverse micelles
has led to signiﬁcant chemical shift changes in a subset of amide
signals. Mapping of the chemical shift changes on the MA surface
indicates a binding mode similar to that of the soluble analogs
with short chains.

Binding of native PI(4,5)P2 to myr(−)GagΔp6 has been char-

acterized by mass spectrometric protein footprinting (Shkriabai
et al., 2006). NHS-biotin modiﬁcation approach was used to iden-
tify lysine residues in Gag that are exposed to solvent or those
that are protected from biotinylation due to direct Gag-PI(4,5)P2
contacts. Data revealed that among 21 surface Lys residues readily
modiﬁed in free Gag, only MA K30 and K32 are protected in the
Gag-PI(4,5)P2 complex. Although NMR and mass spectrometry
methods provide evidence for direct binding of native PI(4,5)P2
to MA, the exact binding interface, and a high-resolution struc-
tural model have yet to be determined. Based on the NMR data
obtained for MA in reverse micelles, our best guess is that the
20-carbon 2
-acyl chain of PI(4,5)P2 is sequestered by the protein.
Confocal microscopy data revealed that Gag molecules assem-
ble at punctate sites on the PM (Hermida-Matsumoto and Resh,
2000). What are these punctate sites and why does Gag select
these sites? To address these questions, we recall a few previous
observations that could support the structural studies and the
MA–PI(4,5)P2 binding mode as well as the overall association

Role of HIV-1 matrix in virus assembly

with the PM. First, there is evidence that punctate sites com-
prise lipid raft microdomains (Aloia et al., 1993; Nguyen and
Hildreth, 2000; Campbell et al., 2001b; Ono and Freed, 2001, 2005;
Ding et al., 2003; Holm et al., 2003; Waheed and Freed, 2009).
Lipid rafts are typically liquid-ordered membrane structures that
contain elevated levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids with sat-
urated fatty acids (Brown and London, 1997, 1998; Melkonian
et al., 1999; Zacharias et al., 2002; Ono and Freed, 2005; Waheed
and Freed, 2009). Proteins that associate with lipid rafts gener-
ally contain two saturated acyl chains or are anchored by adap-
tor molecules that contain two saturated chains (for example,
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins; Brown and Lon-
don, 2000; Ono and Freed, 2005). Because PI(4,5)P2 contains
(cid:2)
stearate (18-carbon saturated acyl chain) at the 1
-position and
arachidonate (20-carbon acyl chain with four non-conjugated
(cid:2)
double bonds) at the 2
-chain
is likely to reduce the afﬁnity of PI(4,5)P2 for ﬂuid regions of
the membrane and promote its association with rafts. Since pre-
vious studies also suggest that PI(4,5)P2 molecules are homoge-
neously dispersed within the PM of quiescent cells but they can
colocalize with lipid rafts upon stimulation (Golub and Caroni,
2005), sequestration of the 2
-acyl chain by MA may suggest a
potential mechanism for the lateral targeting of PI(4,5)P2:Gag
complexes to lipid raft microdomains (Saad et al., 2006). Sec-
ond, the proposed mechanism for Gag binding to membrane is
supported by the ﬁnding that substitution of the saturated myr
group of HIV-1 Gag by unsaturated lipids reduces the afﬁnity of
Gag for rafts and inhibits particle assembly (Lindwasser and Resh,
2002).

Gag-PI(4,5)P2 INTERACTIONS IN OTHER RETROVIRUSES
In the past few years, efforts have been focused on whether Gag tar-
geting and virus assembly in other retroviruses are also dependent
on PI(4,5)P2. Subsequent to our studies on HIV-1, we discovered
that HIV-2 MA binds speciﬁcally to PI(4,5)P2 in a manner iden-
tical to that of HIV-1 (Saad et al., 2008). However, in HIV-2 MA
the myr switch is less sensitive to PI(4,5)P2 binding as the myr
group is found to be sequestered in the complex. The subcellular
site of HIV-2 Gag assembly is also regulated by PI(4,5)P2. Like
HIV-1, overexpression of 5ptaseIV or Arf6/Q67L also signiﬁcantly
reduced levels of released HIV-2 virions, indicating that the pro-
duction of HIV-2 particles is inhibited by PI(4,5)P2 perturbation
(Saad et al., 2008).

In most retroviruses, membrane anchoring is strongly depen-
dent on the myr group. However, Gag proteins of some retro-
viruses, notably alpha retroviruses [the prototype of which is Rous
sarcoma virus (RSV)] and the lentivirus equine infectious anemia
virus (EIAV), lack myr modiﬁcation, and Gag targeting and bind-
ing to the PM is mainly mediated by electrostatic interactions
(Erdie and Wills, 1990; Provitera et al., 2000; Dalton et al., 2005).
For example, the association of RSV MA protein with liposomes
of deﬁned composition is electrostatic in nature and is depen-
dent on the presence of a biologically relevant concentration of
negatively charged lipids like phosphatidylserine (Dalton et al.,
2005). In addition, MA-PI(4,5)P2 interactions have been detected
in Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) and Mason-Pﬁzer
monkey virus (MPMV; Stansell et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2008;
Chen et al., 2008; Hamard-Peron et al., 2010). As has been observed

for HIV-1 and HIV-2 MA, NMR-based studies have shown that
a soluble analog of PI(4,5)P2 interacts directly with EIAV MA,
suggesting a potential role of this lipid in EIAV Gag assembly (Chen
et al., 2008). However, a most recent study investigating the role of
PI(4,5)P2 in assembly of EIAV show that Gag was detected on the
PM and in compartments enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3,5-
biphosphate [PI(3,5)P2; Fernandes et al., 2011]. NMR studies have
shown that EIAV MA binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate
[PI(3)P] with a higher afﬁnity than that of PI(4,5)P2 (Fernandes
et al., 2011). Treatment of cells with YM201636, a kinase inhibitor
that blocks production of PI(3,5)P2 from PI(3)P led to Gag colo-
calization with aberrant compartments and inhibited VLP release
(Fernandes et al., 2011). In contrast to HIV-1, release of EIAV VLPs
was not signiﬁcantly diminished by coexpression with 5ptase IV.
Taken together, these results indicate that membrane targeting in
EIAV proceeds via a mechanism that is probably distinct from that
in HIV-1 or HIV-2. On the other hand, when compared to HIV-1
and HIV-2 recent studies have shown that human T-lymphotropic
virus type (HTLV-1) and RSV Gag proteins have either lower or no
requirement for PI(4,5)P2 for membrane association (Chan et al.,
2011; Inlora et al., 2011).

ROLE OF Gag IN ENVELOPE (Env) INCORPORATION
Retroviral Env protein is a glycosylated polyprotein synthesized
as intact gp160 precursor that is subsequently cleaved by cellular
proteases to form a complex of a surface unit (gp120) and trans-
membrane domain (gp41). During virus assembly, the gp120/gp41
complex is incorporated in the lipid bilayer of the nascent virions.
Despite the progress made in understanding the structural details
of Env and its components as well as the trafﬁcking pathway of Env
polyprotein, the mechanism by which Env is incorporated into
virus particles is not completely understood. The Gag protein has
long been implicated in Env incorporation based on the proposed
interaction between the MA domain and the cytoplasmic (CT)
domain of gp41 (Yu et al., 1992; Dorfman et al., 1994; Freed and
Martin, 1995, 1996; Mammano et al., 1995). However, importance
of this interaction is controversial since in many cell lines (HeLa,
293T, CV-1, and COS), deletion of the CT domain has virtually no
effect on Env incorporation (Wilk et al., 1992; Freed and Martin,
1995, 1996; Murakami and Freed, 2000). Checkley et al. (2011)
have recently reviewed the current understanding of HIV-1 Env
trafﬁcking and incorporation into virions. Several models have
been proposed to explain Env incorporation into virus particles
(Checkley et al., 2011):

(i) “Passive” model: Env is expressed on the host PM and sub-
sequently incorporated into budding virions. Support of this
model stems from the observation that host membrane pro-
teins are abundantly incorporated into retrovirus particles
(Lusso et al., 1990; Arthur et al., 1992; Ott, 2008).

(ii) Direct Gag–Env interaction: Genetic data revealed that the
MA domain of Gag is required for Env incorporation (Yu
et al., 1992; Dorfman et al., 1994; Freed and Martin, 1995,
1996). Mutations in or deletion of the MA domain of Gag
decreased Env incorporation (Freed and Martin, 1995, 1996;
Mammano et al., 1995; Reil et al., 1998; Brandano and Steven-
son, 2012), while deletion of the gp41 CT domain reversed the
Env incorporation defect dictated by MA mutations (Freed

Role of HIV-1 matrix in virus assembly

and Martin, 1995, 1996; Mammano et al., 1995), or MA dele-
tion (Reil et al., 1998). Altogether, these studies suggest that
MA is required for full-length Env incorporation whereas
Env–MA interaction is apparently not required for incorpo-
ration of truncated Env. The requirement of the MA and CT
domains for Gag–gp41 interactions appears to be supported
by a few studies albeit evidence for direct interactions is still
weak. For example, previous studies have shown that HIV-1
Env is localized to the basolateral surface of polarized epithe-
lial cells (Owens and Compans, 1989). Gag has been shown to
bud in a non-polarized manner in these cells when Env was
not expressed. Budding, however, was restricted to the basolat-
eral surface upon coexpression of Gag and Env (Owens et al.,
1991). Mutations in MA or CT truncation undermined the
ability of Env to direct basolateral budding of Gag (Lodge et al.,
1994). Although these studies suggest a cross-talk between the
MA and CT domains, they do not necessarily indicate a direct
interaction (Checkley et al., 2011).

(iii) Gag–Env cotargeting : As mentioned above, the absence of com-
pelling evidence for direct interactions between Gag and gp41
may suggest that a cellular constituent like a protein or mem-
brane acts as a bridge or a docking platform for the Gag–Env
complex. A role of a cellular factor(s) in Env incorporation is
perhaps supported by the results showing that the requirement
of CT domain is strongly dependent on the cell type (permis-
sive cells like HeLa, COS, and 293T; Wilk et al., 1992; Akari
et al., 2000; Murakami and Freed, 2000). In non-permissive
cell lines (e.g., T cells and macrophages), removal of gp41 CT
led to ∼10-fold decrease in Env incorporation (Murakami and
Freed, 2000). The identity of cellular factors required for Env
incorporation in permissive and non-permissive cells have yet
to be determined.

(iv) Indirect Gag–Env interaction: Since it is not clear whether
there is a direct interaction between the MA domain of Gag
and gp41 CT, it is conceivable that the interaction is medi-
ated by cellular protein(s). Among the gp41 CT-interacting
proteins are the adaptor protein complexes AP-1 and AP-2.
The AP complexes are heterotetramers that mediate both the
recruitment of clathrin to membranes and the recognition of
sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane
cargo molecules (Robinson and Bonifacino, 2001; Boehm and
Bonifacino, 2002; Nakatsu and Ohno, 2003). While AP-1 has
been shown to regulate the subcellular localization of Env via
binding to a dileucine motif in gp41 CT (Berlioz-Torrent et al.,
1999; Byland et al., 2007; Wyss et al., 2011), AP-2 has been
shown to bind to the gp41 CT domain and drive clathrin-
mediated endocytosis of Env from the PM (Ohno et al., 1997;
Boge et al., 1998). Interestingly, AP-1 and AP-2 has been shown
to bind to the MA domain of Gag (see below; Batonick et al.,
2005; Camus et al., 2007). Other proteins like the 47-kDa tail
interacting protein (TIP47) and calmodulin (CaM) have been
proposed to play some role in Env incorporation (discussed in
more details below).

POTENTIAL ROLE OF MA IN GENOMIC RNA PACKAGING
Although MA’s role in HIV-1 Gag targeting and assembly on the
PM is the best understood, there is mounting evidence that it also

plays a role in retroviral genome packaging. A recent review has
shed light on the current understanding of the functional role of
MA in genome packaging (Parent and Gudleski, 2011). Since the
MA protein is usually associated to the lipid bilayer and on the
opposite end from the NC domain, the biological importance for
the proposed MA–RNA interactions is controversial and has been
under scrutiny for a long time. Interest in assessing the functional
role of MA in genome packaging stems from earlier studies on
the interactions between HIV-1 MA and other retroviruses (e.g.,
RSV and bovine leukemia virus) with single-stranded and double-
stranded DNA and RNA (Leis et al., 1978; Darlix and Spahr, 1982;
Méric and Spahr, 1986; Steeg and Vogt, 1990; Katoh et al., 1991; Ott
et al., 2005; Alfadhli et al., 2009b; Cai et al., 2010; Ramalingam et al.,
2011). It has been shown that MA binds directly to an RNA mol-
ecule that is highly homologous to a fragment of the pol domain
(Purohit et al., 2001). The interaction interface of MA is conﬁned
to the basic domain; substitutions in the basic residues led to weak-
ened afﬁnity to RNA in vitro and a delay in virus replication in vivo
(Purohit et al., 2001). However, it has yet to be established whether
MA binds directly to the packaging signal (ψ) of the RNA genome.
Most recent studies by Akira Ono and co-workers revealed that
the highly basic region (HBR) in the N-terminus of MA not only
contributes to binding of PI(4,5)P2 to Gag, but is also capable of
binding to RNA (Chukkapalli et al., 2010). These results are con-
sistent with in vitro and NMR studies (Purohit et al., 2001; Hearps
et al., 2008; Alfadhli et al., 2011). Interestingly, binding of RNA to
HBR was found to inhibit association of Gag to membrane lipo-
somes in the absence of PI(4,5)P2 (Chukkapalli et al., 2010). As a
consequence, RNA was considered as a negative regulator of Gag-
membrane binding. Thus, the interplay between Gag, PI(4,5)P2,
and RNA appears to be an important aspect of Gag assembly that
has to be examined further.

THE MISSING LINK: HIV-1 Gag EN ROUTE TO THE PLASMA
MEMBRANE?
Great progress has been made in deﬁning both the viral and cellu-
lar determinants of HIV-1 assembly and release (Chu et al., 2010).
However, the trafﬁcking pathway used by Gag to reach its assembly
sites in the infected cell is poorly understood. There is mounting
evidence that HIV-1 Gag interacts with several cellular proteins
during the replication cycle. These include CaM (Radding et al.,
2000), the human adaptor protein complexes AP-1,AP-2, and AP-3
(Batonick et al., 2005; Dong et al., 2005; Camus et al., 2007), TIP47
(Lopez-Vergès et al., 2006), Golgi-localized gammaear containing
Arf-binding protein (GGA; Joshi et al., 2008, 2009b), ADP ribo-
sylation factor (Arf; Joshi et al., 2008), the suppressor of cytokine
signaling 1 (SOCS1; Ryo et al., 2008; Nishi et al., 2009), a lymphoid
speciﬁc Src kinase (Lck; Strasner et al., 2008), N -ethylmaleimide-
sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE; Joshi et al.,
2011), Filamin A (Cooper et al., 2011), vacuolar protein sorting-
associated protein 18 (Vps18; Tomita et al., 2011), Mon2 (Tomita
et al., 2011), and Lyric (Engeland et al., 2011). The majority of
these proteins have been implicated in retroviral assembly. Since
we are focusing on the MA protein, we will summarize the cur-
rent understanding of the proposed interactions between the MA
domain of Gag and a small selection of the proteins described
above including CaM, AP-3, TIP47, SOCS1, and Lyric.

Role of HIV-1 matrix in virus assembly

POTENTIAL ROLE OF CaM IN HIV REPLICATION
CaM is a ubiquitous calcium-binding protein expressed in all
eukaryotic cells. It binds to and regulates different protein targets,
thereby affecting many different cellular functions (Osawa et al.,
1999; Chin and Means, 2000; Hoeﬂich and Ikura, 2002; Vetter and
Leclerc, 2003; Yamniuk and Vogel, 2004; Ishida and Vogel, 2006). It
binds more than 100 proteins “speciﬁcally” (Rogers and Strehler,
1996) and is found in different subcellular locations, including
the cytoplasm, within organelles, or associated with the plasma or
organelle membranes (Osawa et al., 1999; Chin and Means, 2000;
Hoeﬂich and Ikura, 2002; Vetter and Leclerc, 2003; Yamniuk and
Vogel, 2004; Ishida and Vogel, 2006). CaM is perhaps one of the
most characterized cellular proteins and its interactions with pro-
teins have been extensively studied (Chattopadhyaya et al., 1992;
Finn et al., 1995; Chin and Means, 2000; Fallon and Quiocho,
2003). Binding of calcium to CaM triggers a major conforma-
tional change and helical rearrangement, enabling it to bind to
speciﬁc proteins for a speciﬁc response.

Subcellular distribution of CaM in HIV-infected cells has been
shown to be distinct from that observed in uninfected cells
(Radding et al., 1996). In vivo and in vitro studies revealed that
CaM interacts with HIV-1 Gag, Nef, and gp160 proteins (Towler
et al., 1988; Srinivas et al., 1993; Radding et al., 2000; Hayashi et al.,
2002; Matsubara et al., 2005). Pioneering studies by Hunter and
co-workers have shown that HIV-1 Gag can interact with CaM in a
calcium-dependent manner (Radding et al., 2000). Gag and CaM
colocalize in a diffuse pattern in the cytoplasm. Investigation of the
underlying mechanism of Gag–CaM interactions has gained some
momentum recently. Our lab (Ghanam et al., 2010) and others
(Chow et al., 2010) have shown that CaM binds directly to the MA
protein with 1:1 stoichiometry in a Ca2+
-dependent manner. We
have also established that: (i) CaM-binding to myr(+)MA induces
a structural change that triggers myr exposure (Figure 5), (ii) the
myr group is not involved in CaM-binding, and (iii) CaM–MA
interaction is hydrophobic and entropically driven, while electro-
static interactions appear to be inconsequential (Ghanam et al.,
2010).

Radding et al. (2000) have shown that peptides from the N-
terminus of MA bind to CaM with variable afﬁnities and in
different modes. These studies have prompted others to conduct
SAXS experiments to elucidate the global features of CaM bound
to short peptides derived from the MA protein (Izumi et al., 2008).
SAXS studies conducted on CaM complexed with full-length MA
shed light on the global features of the complex (Chow et al.,
2010). However, SAXS methods cannot provide details on the
complex interface and cannot identify speciﬁc residues that are
important for the formation and stabilization of the complex. We
have utilized NMR, biochemical, and biophysical methods to elu-
cidate the precise molecular mechanism of MA–CaM interactions
(Samal et al., 2011). In this work, we have (i) identiﬁed the inter-
action interface of CaM bound to short peptides derived from the
MA protein, (ii) shown that MA peptides bind to CaM with vari-
able afﬁnities and diverse modes, and (iii) identiﬁed the minimal
CaM-binding domain of MA as residues 8–43 (MA-8–43).

A typical CaM-binding peptide is 15–30 residues long with
amphipathic character and a propensity to form an α-helix (Ishida
and Vogel, 2006), features that helices I and II of MA possess

FIGURE 5 | CaM-binding to MA triggers myr exposure. Surface

Spheres represent Ca2+ ions.

(Figure 6). The 36-residue long MA-8–43 peptide is perhaps one
of the largest CaM-binding motifs to be discovered. The fact that
MA-8–43 forms two helices is another striking feature of this pep-
tide since almost all known CaM-target proteins usually possess
a domain that forms only one α-helix. In many of the classical
CaM-binding targets, hydrophobic residues usually occupy con-
served positions at 1–5–10 or 1–8–14, which point to one face
of the helix (Ishida and Vogel, 2006). Although these patterns are
typically found in many CaM-binding proteins, numerous unclas-
siﬁed examples were also identiﬁed (Ishida and Vogel, 2006). By
using a web-based tool to identify a sequence pattern with potential
CaM-binding sites (Yap et al., 2000), the region between Arg22 and
Glu40 (Figure 6) scored the highest. Scores are based on several
criteria including hydropathy, α-helical propensity, residue weight
and charge, hydrophobic residue content, helical class, and occur-
rence of particular residues. Arg22–Glu40 represents the majority
of helix II. However, this peptide does not contain a motif that
matches any of the known patterns of CaM-binding sites. Thus,
MA-8–43 is considered a novel and unclassiﬁed CaM-binding
sequence that is substantially different (in length and composition)

Role of HIV-1 matrix in virus assembly

signaling through a “Ca2+

cytoplasm of the infected cell may suggest a role of CaM in
the (pre)assembly stage. Could it be that CaM facilitates Gag
transport to the PM? This is a reasonable hypothesis given the
fact that one of the major functions of CaM is shuttling pro-
teins to the PM. However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested.
One interesting characteristic of CaM is its preferential binding
to myristoylated proteins. Membrane association and dissocia-
tion of myristoylated proteins are often regulated by intracellular
Ca2+
-myr switch” such as recoverin
(Tanaka et al., 1995), neurocalcin (Faurobert et al., 1996), and S-
modulin (Matsuda et al., 1998). As a consequence, intracellular
localization from the cytosol to the membrane is dependent on
Ca2+
binding (Braunewell and Gundelﬁnger, 1999). Other myris-
toylated proteins including myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase
substrate (MARCKS), brain-speciﬁc protein kinase C substrate
(CAP-23/NAP-22) and HIV-1 Nef interact with CaM via the myr
group to facilitate their intracellular localization and membrane
targeting (Matsubara et al., 2003, 2004, 2005). Our structural stud-
ies were the ﬁrst of their kind to be conducted on binding of CaM
to a native myristoylated protein and the ﬁrst to show the subse-
quent exposure of the myr group (Figure 5). The ﬁnding that the
myr group is not“grabbed” by CaM may suggest a novel functional
role of CaM in the trafﬁcking and/or targeting of Gag to the PM
for assembly.

The functional role of CaM in the HIV replication cycle could
be rather complex since interactions with gp160 and Nef have
also been detected. Expression of the HIV-1 gp160 protein has led
to a marked increase in CaM distribution (Radding et al., 1996).
The CaM-binding region in gp160 was identiﬁed to be a heli-
cal peptide in gp41. Deletion of this region led to diminished
virus infectivity (Srinivas et al., 1993; Radding et al., 1996). On the
other hand, mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of gp41 elim-
inated co-immunoprecipitation of Env with calmodulin but had
no signiﬁcant effect on viral production or Env expression (Micoli
et al., 2006). Confocal microscopy data conﬁrmed the elevated
level of CaM distribution and also showed that CaM colocalizes
with the gp160 protein (Radding et al., 1996). Thus, the interplay
between gp160, CaM, and Gag could be important in HIV repli-
cation. Although it is reasonable to hypothesize that HIV–CaM
protein interactions may lead to disruption of CaM-dependent
cell-signaling pathways and contribute to immune dysfunction
during HIV pathogenesis, the exact functional role of CaM in
HIV replication has yet to be examined.

ROLE OF THE ADAPTOR PROTEIN COMPLEXES IN Gag
TRAFFICKING
To understand the critical steps of the molecular mechanism of
HIV assembly, it is vital to identify the cellular machinery, its
components, and how these components interact with each other
and/or the HIV proteins. Although it is widely accepted that in
most cell types HIV-1 Gag budding and assembly occur on the
PM (Hermida-Matsumoto and Resh, 2000; Jouvenet et al., 2006,
2008; Finzi et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007; Welsch et al., 2007; Gousset
et al., 2008; Joshi et al., 2009a; Ono, 2009, 2010), several research
groups have shown that late endosomal compartments can serve
as major assembly sites (Nguyen et al., 2003; Nydegger et al., 2003;
Pelchen-Matthews et al., 2003; Sherer et al., 2003; Grigorov et al.,

from all known CaM-binding domains. These ﬁndings conﬁrm
the enormous versatility of CaM-target complex formation and
suggest a novel CaM-binding mode that requires engagement of
hydrophobic residues from both helices I and II of MA (Ghanam
et al., 2010; Samal et al., 2011).

The exact functional role of CaM in HIV replication is not
known. The observation that CaM colocalized with Gag in the

Role of HIV-1 matrix in virus assembly

2006). To further explore the assembly pathway in late endosomal
compartments, efforts focused on cellular proteins and protein
complexes that typically play roles in protein sorting to and from
the endosomal pathway. Several of these factors, which are impli-
cated in Gag trafﬁcking and assembly have been discovered. These
include AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 (Batonick et al., 2005; Dong et al.,
2005; Camus et al., 2007). AP-3 appears to be involved in the sort-
ing of a subset of transmembrane proteins targeted to lysosomes
and lysosome-related organelles. Studies by Spearman et al. (1997)
indicate that HIV-1 Gag binds to the δ subunit of the AP-3 complex
(Dong et al., 2005). The AP-3 binding domain in Gag is suggested
to be within the N-terminal region of MA (helix I; Figure 6). Gag
constructs lacking the MA domain failed to bind and recruit the
AP-3 complex. In addition, particle formation by WT Gag was
severely diminished by a dominant negative AP-3 δ fragment and
by siRNA depletion of AP-3, indicating that interaction between
Gag and AP-3 is essential for normal productive trafﬁcking path-
way of Gag in the cell (Dong et al., 2005). The trafﬁcking of Gag
to CD63-positive intracellular compartments was also eliminated
when Gag–AP-3 interaction was disrupted.

In addition to binding to Gag, the cytoplasmic tail of gp41
contains a tyrosine-based signal that has been shown to be active
in promoting clathrin-mediated endocytosis through interactions
with the μ subunit of AP-2 (Boge et al., 1998; Berlioz-Torrent et al.,
1999). This observation has led to the hypothesis that the Env pro-
tein is internalized to sorting/recycling endosome compartment
where it becomes associated with Gag (Dong et al., 2005). The
dual role of AP complexes in Env and Gag trafﬁcking pathways
and compelling evidence for direct physical interactions between
MA and AP-3 have yet to be determined.

TIP47: ROLE IN Gag LOCALIZATION AND Env
INCORPORATION
TIP47 is an essential protein for endosome-to-TGN retrograde
transport of mannose-6-phosphate receptors, has been shown to
form a ternary complex by bridging between the Env and Gag
proteins (Lopez-Vergès et al., 2006). The interaction between Gag
and TIP47 is mediated by the MA domain. Mutations in the MA
domain of Gag that abrogate TIP47 binding were found to inhibit
Env incorporation, Env–Gag colocalization, and virus infectiv-
ity (Lopez-Vergès et al., 2006). Silencing of TIP47 was found
to impair Env incorporation and infectivity and abolished co-
immunoprecipitation of Gag and Env. Based on these ﬁndings,
it was suggested that TIP47 acts as a connector between Gag and
Env during assembly (Lopez-Vergès et al., 2006). Interestingly, sev-
eral point mutations and deletions within the ﬁrst 23 residues of
MA resulted in loss of TIP47 binding and thus Env incorpora-
tion. Among these mutations were W16A and E17A. Mutations in
helix I of MA (L13, W16, E17, and K18) have been shown to block
Env incorporation (Dorfman et al., 1994; Freed and Martin, 1996;
Davis et al., 2006), which led to the suggestion that MA interacts
directly with the Env protein. Altogether, studies on TIP47 suggest
a functional role of this protein in Env incorporation and colocal-
ization of Gag and Env. However, role of TIP47 in HIV biology
remains unclear as studies conducted in other laboratories have
failed to support any role of TIP47 in particle production or virus
replication (Checkley et al., 2011).

Gag–SOCS1 INTERACTIONS
SOCS1, a member of negative regulators of cytokine signaling
(Yoshimura et al., 2007) has been recently shown to be an inducible
host-factor during HIV-1 infection and to regulate the late stages
of the virus replication pathway (Ryo et al., 2008; Nishi et al.,
2009). SOCS1 interacts with the MA and NC regions of Gag to
facilitate its intracellular trafﬁcking and stability. The depletion of
SOCS1 caused a severe reduction in Gag trafﬁcking and assembly
(Ryo et al., 2008). It has been also shown that SOCS1 is involved in
regulating Gag trafﬁcking via the microtubule-dependent cellular
machinery (Nishi et al., 2009).

Genetically, SOCS family members have a central SH2 domain
and a conserved SOCS box (Yoshimura et al., 2007). Structure–
function analyses revealed that the SH2 domain is critical for
efﬁcient binding to its substrates (Narazaki et al., 1998). Ryo et al.
(2008) reinforced these ﬁndings by showing that a mutant lacking
the SH2 domain does not bind HIV-1 Gag, whereas an N-terminus
or a SOCS1 box deletion did not affect binding to Gag in 293T cells.
Thus, elucidation of the structural requirements of Gag–SOCS1
interactions will provide insights into the functional role of SOCS1
in Gag trafﬁcking and stability throughout the HIV replication
cycle.

LYRIC–Gag INTERACTIONS
Lyric is a ubiquitously expressed 64 kDa protein with several iso-
forms due to differential splicing, which differ in their intracellular
localization, and is normally involved in various signaling path-
ways (Thirkettle et al., 2009). Previous studies have shown that
Lyric is an HIV-inducible gene that is involved in various signal-
ing pathways and acts in a positive-feedback loop promoting HIV
replication (Thirkettle et al., 2009). A recent study has identiﬁed
Lyric as an HIV-1 Gag-interacting protein. Endogenous Lyric has
been shown to be incorporated in HIV-1 virions (Engeland et al.,
2011). Both MA and NC appear to be required for Lyric binding.
However, deleting NC and fusing MA with a GCN4 motif to drive
trimerization led to the same binding afﬁnity to Lyric. Thus, it is
possible that Lyric binding to Gag is mostly dependent on the MA
protein but also requires multimerization. Gag-interacting region
in the Lyric protein has been mapped to a region spanning residues
101–289. Expression of this region increased Gag expression and
viral infectivity. Interestingly, the observation of Gag–Lyric inter-
actions in MMLV and EIAV (Engeland et al., 2011) suggests that
Lyric’s role in the replication cycle is probably a conserved feature
among retroviruses. Despite the experimental evidence for Gag–
Lyric interaction, the precise functional role for Lyric has yet to be
established.

SUMMARY
Several cellular factors have been proposed to interact directly
with the MA domain to facilitate Gag trafﬁcking and assembly.
However, molecular interactions have yet to be validated and char-
acterized in most cases. Despite the tremendous progress achieved
in understanding the structural properties of Gag and its domains,
high-resolution structures of their complexes with cellular part-
ners are very limited. The discovery of new cellular factors that
bind to Gag or Gag components (Brass et al., 2008; Jäger et al.,
2011) should pave the way for further structural investigation and

hopefully will lead to identiﬁcation of novel mechanisms and/or
pathways critical for virus assembly. Such knowledge should facil-
itate the development of better approaches for the treatment of
HIV.

NOMENCLATURE
MA mutants are named based on the myr group being designated
as residue 1. In contrast, studies that performed the characteri-
zation of the mutants discussed here considered the N-terminal
Gly of the myristoylated protein as residue 1 (Freed et al., 1994;
Ono and Freed, 1999, 2004; Ono et al., 2000a; Joshi et al., 2009a;

Chukkapalli et al., 2010). Thus, the mutant names are offset by
one residue.
