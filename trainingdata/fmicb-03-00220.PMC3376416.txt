Candida albicans forms oral bioﬁlms that cause disease and are difﬁcult to treat with
conventional antifungal agents. Tea tree oil (TTO) is a natural compound with reported
antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities.The aims of the study were to evaluate the
antifungal efﬁcacy of TTO and key derivatives against C. albicans bioﬁlms, to assess the
toxicological effects ofTTO on a clinically relevant oral cell line, and to investigate its impact
on inﬂammation. TTO and its derivatives were examined against 100 clinical strains of C.
albicans. Planktonic minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the
CLSI M-27A broth microdilution method. Sessile MICs were determined using an XTT
reduction assay. Inhibition, time-kill, and mode of action studies were performed. OKF6-
TERT2 epithelial cells were used for cytotoxicity and cytokine expression assays. Planktonic
C. albicans isolates were susceptible to TTO, terpinen-4-ol (T-4-ol), and α-terpineol, with an
MIC50 of 0.5, 0.25, and 0.25%, respectively.These three compounds also displayed potent
activity against the 69 bioﬁlm-forming strains, of whichT-4-ol and α-terpineol displayed rapid
kill kinetics. For all three compounds, 1× MIC50 effectively inhibited bioﬁlm growth when
C. albicans were treated at 0, 1, and 2 h post adhesion. By scanning electron microscopy
analysis and PI uptake, TTO and derivative components were shown to be cell membrane
active. TTO and T-4-ol were cytotoxic at 1× MIC50, whereas at 0.5× MIC50 T-4-ol displayed
no signiﬁcant toxicity. Transcript and protein analysis showed a reduction of IL-8 when
treated with TTO and T-4-ol. These data provide further in vitro evidence that TTO and its
derivative components, speciﬁcally T-4-ol, exhibit strong antimicrobial properties against
fungal bioﬁlms. T-4-ol has safety advantages over the complete essential oil and may be
suitable for prophylaxis and treatment of established oropharyngeal candidosis. A clinical
trial of T-4-ol is worthy of consideration.

INTRODUCTION
Many cancer therapies have a profound negative impact on
oral health, causing serious complications (Dreizen, 1990). These
include both non-infectious and infectious side-effects with
potential for systemic spread (Wingard, 1990). Oral fungal infec-
tions, caused predominantly by Candida species, are common in
patients suffering from cancer at all stages of the disease, espe-
cially those receiving palliative care (Sweeney et al., 1998; Sweeney
and Bagg, 2000; Davies et al., 2006). Candida albicans is known
to form complex bioﬁlms (Ramage et al., 2005; Ganguly and
Mitchell, 2011) and other Candida spp. also have this ability to
varying degrees, though it is strain-dependent (Silva et al., 2009).
Such bioﬁlms form on the oral epithelium or on the surfaces
of intra-oral prostheses (Williams et al., 2011), and can result in
pseudomembranous or erythematous candidosis.

The effectiveness of most antifungal agents is signiﬁcantly
reduced if yeasts are in a bioﬁlm as opposed to the planktonic
state (Kuhn and Ghannoum, 2004; Lamfon et al., 2004; d’Enfert,
2006). Furthermore, in recent years there has been growing con-
cern about the increasing prevalence of infections caused by yeasts
that are resistant to commonly used antifungal drugs (Bagg et al.,
2003), with the emergence of strains of C. albicans that are resis-
tant to the azole antifungals (Casalinuovo et al., 2004), in addition
to the inherently reduced drug susceptibility of many non-albicans
yeasts that can be selected through over-use of antifungal drugs
(Davies et al., 2002; Bagg et al., 2003). There is a need to identify
new methods of preventing and treating oral candidosis among
immunocompromised patients, including those with cancer, both
to improve treatment of established infections and to limit further
development of drug resistance. Given the extensive evolutionary

interaction that exists between plants and microorganisms it is
unlikely that resistance would be cause for concern, neverthe-
less, clinically we would anticipate natural compounds to augment
existing antifungal agents opposed to direct replacement.

One agent which merits consideration is tea tree oil (TTO;
Hartford and Zug, 2005; Carson et al., 2006), which has recently
reported to have minimal impact on developing resistance (Ham-
mer et al., 2012). TTO is produced as a distillate of leaves of the
Melaleuca alternifolia shrub, which grows in New South Wales,
Australia. It is a complex mixture of essential oils, comprising
approximately 100 components, most of which are monoterpenes,
sesquiterpenes, and their related alcohols (Carson et al., 2006).
TTO has been shown to possess a number of therapeutic prop-
erties, including anti-inﬂammatory activities (Hart et al., 2000;
Koh et al., 2002; Pearce et al., 2005) and there is current inter-
est in its possible anti-tumor properties (Bozzuto et al., 2011).
However, it is best known for its antimicrobial activity against
a wide spectrum of microorganisms, for example Staphylococcus
aureus (including MRSA; Thompson et al., 2008; Kwiecinski et al.,
2009), a range of oral bacteria (Hammer et al., 2003b), and certain
viruses, including herpes simplex and inﬂuenza viruses (Carson
et al., 2001; Garozzo et al., 2011). TTO also has potent activ-
ity against many fungi (Hammer et al., 2003a, 2004), including
some azole-resistant yeasts (Mondello et al., 2003; Bagg et al.,
2006) and there is some evidence for its efﬁcacy in treating ﬂu-
conazole refractory oral candidosis in AIDS patients. This raises
the possibility of using TTO preparations for the prevention and
treatment of oral candidal infections. Oral care products are now
available containing TTO (Soukoulis and Hirsch, 2004), including
an alcohol-free mouthwash. However, hypersensitivity reactions
to TTO have been reported (Knight and Hausen, 1994; Mozelsio
et al., 2003; Hammer et al., 2006; Rutherford et al., 2007) and the
palatability of the agent as an oral preparation is poor. Moreover,
given the complex chemical composition of TTO, which results in
batch-to-batch variability, then the ability to accurately interpret
its clinical utility is limited. Some of the individual components
of TTO are believed to have antimicrobial properties (Mondello
et al., 2006) and may be more appropriate for development into
oral care products with respect to safety and consistency.

This study had three aims. The ﬁrst was to evaluate the efﬁcacy
of TTO and two of its key derivatives [terpinen-4-ol (T-4-ol) and
α-terpineol] against bioﬁlms formed by a clinically diverse panel
of C. albicans isolates. Secondly, the toxicological effects of TTO
and derivative components were assessed by means of a clinically
relevant oral cell line. Finally, the study aimed to investigate further
the previously reported anti-inﬂammatory effects of TTO.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STRAINS AND GROWTH CONDITIONS
One-hundred clinical strains of C. albicans were used in the course
of this study, which were isolated from a wide variety of patient
groups, including those with denture stomatitis (Glasgow Den-
tal School, n = 26), those receiving palliative care for advanced
cancer (Accord Hospice, Paisley, n = 30), neonates (Royal Hos-
pital for Sick Children, Glasgow, n = 36), and those with blood-
stream infections (Glasgow Royal Inﬁrmary, n = 8). All strains
were maintained routinely on Sabouraud dextrose (SAB) agar

(Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) stored at 4˚C, and stored indeﬁnitely
on Microbank beads (Prolab Diagnostics) at −80˚C.

ANTIFUNGAL COMPOUNDS
Tea tree oil and seven HPLC-grade derivatives of the oil obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset) were used in the study.
The derivatives included terpinen-4-ol (T-4-ol), α-terpineol, 1-
8-cineole, terpinolene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, and p-cymene.
Stock concentrations of each component were prepared in RPMI-
1640 AutoMod™ medium (Sigma, UK), containing 0.5% (v/v)
Tween® 80 (ICI Americas, Inc.). Each compound was prepared as
a 4% v/v solution for testing and serially diluted for both plank-
tonic and sessile susceptibility testing. All procedures were carried
out in a laminar ﬂow cabinet (Hera Safe laminar ﬂow cabinet,
Kendro, Model K515).

SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING AND BIOFILM INHIBITION
Antifungal testing to determine planktonic minimum inhibitory
concentrations (PMICs) was performed using the CLSI M-
27A broth microdilution method (Clinical Laboratory Standards
Institute, 2008). For sessile susceptibility testing, C. albicans
bioﬁlms were formed as previously described on polystyrene,
ﬂat-bottomed, 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Incorporated,
Corning, NY, USA; Ramage et al., 2001). These were treated with
a range of concentrations of each antifungal compound (0.0625–
2%) in RPMI-1640 containing 0.5% (v/v) TWEEN 80®. After 24 h
challenge the sessile minimum fungicidal concentrations (SMFCs)
were determined as a 50% inhibition compared to the untreated
control using a XTT reduction assay, as described previously
(Ramage et al., 2001). For time-kill studies C. albicans bioﬁlms
(n = 3) were grown for 24 h, then exposed to TTO, T-4-ol, or α-
terpineol at a concentration of 2× MIC90 for 2, 5, 15, and 60 min.
Metabolic activity was quantiﬁed by the XTT assay and bioﬁlm
viability assessed as a relative reduction in absorbance in com-
parison to untreated controls. For inhibition, C. albicans isolates
(n = 4) were plated in 96-well microtiter plates for bioﬁlm growth
(1× 106 cells/ml) then treated at 0, 1, 2, or 4 h after adhesion with
TTO, T-4-ol, and α-terpineol at 0.5 and 1× MIC50. The cells were
then incubated for a further 24 h at 37˚C. The levels of bioﬁlm
inhibition were compared to an untreated control using a crys-
tal violet biomass assay, as previously described (Mowat et al.,
2007). All experiments outlined above were performed on two
independent occasions with a minimum of three clinical isolates
in triplicate.

MODE OF ACTION
We investigated whether TTO or T-4-ol interacted with the mem-
brane using a propidium iodide (PI) uptake assay, as previously
reported (Sherry et al., 2012). PI is a ﬂuorescent dye that dif-
fuses through the membranes of dead cells and is incorporated
within nuclear DNA, therefore increased ﬂuorescence directly cor-
relates with reduced membrane integrity. C. albicans (3153A) was
grown in an overnight broth as described previously, and stan-
dardized to 1× 107 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 and treated with TTO,
T-4-ol, or α-terpineol at a concentration of 2× MIC50 for 10,
20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min. Following treatment, cells were cen-
trifuged at 10,000 rpm to remove the compounds, washed with

PBS, stained with 20 µM of propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich,
UK), and incubated at 37˚C for 15 min to allow the dye to bind to
DNA. One-hundred microliters of each sample were transferred
to a black microtiter plate (Corning Incorporated, NY, USA) and
ﬂuorescence measured using a microtiter plate reader (FluoStar
Omega, BMG Labtech) at excitation and emission wavelengths
535/617 nm, respectively. Raw data were corrected for background
ﬂuorescence and the assay was carried out in triplicate. In addition,
the physical effect of these compounds was assessed microscopi-
cally using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). C. albicans was
adhered to Thermanox™coverslips (Nunc Inc., Thermo Fisher Sci-
entiﬁc) for 2 h within 24 well tissue culture plates then treated
with TTO and T-4-ol at 2× MIC50 for 24 h. The cells were ﬁxed
using 2% w/v para-formaldehyde, 2% v/v glutaraldehyde, 0.15 M
sodium cacodylate, and 0.15% Alcian Blue (pH 7.4), and pre-
pared for SEM as previously described (Erlandsen et al., 2004). The
ﬁxed and dried bioﬁlm samples were sputter-coated with gold and
viewed under a JEOL JSM-6400 scanning electron microscope.

ORAL EPITHELIAL CELL LINE
OKF6-TERT2 epithelial cells were used as previously described
(Ramage et al., 2012). This is an immortalized human oral ker-
atinocyte cell line provided by the Rheinwald Laboratory (Brigham
and Woman’s Hospital, Boston). These cells were immortalized
by forced expression of telomerase, and resemble primary oral
keratinocytes in studies of cytotoxicity or inducible cytokine
and beta-defensin expression (Dongari-Bagtzoglou and Kashleva,
2003). The cells were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium
(KSFM) supplemented with 100 IU penicillin, 100 µg/ml strepto-
mycin, 25 µg/ml bovine pituitary extract (BPE), 0.2 ng/ml epider-
mal growth factor (EGF), and 0.3 mM CaCl2 (0.4 mM total Ca2+
).
Primary periradicular ﬁbroblasts (PRF, kind gift of Professor Colin
Murray, University of Glasgow) were cultured in standard Dul-
becco’s Modiﬁed Eagles Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 IU penicillin, and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin. Both cell lines were passaged at approximately 90%
conﬂuence, using 0.05% Trypsin EDTA. Experiments were used
with cells between passages 5 and 10.

TOXICITY STUDIES
TTO and T-4-ol dilutions were prepared in KSFM or DMEM
with 0.25% (v/v) Tween® 80 for OKF6 or PRF cells, respec-
tively. To assess cytotoxicity, cells were seeded at 1× 105 cells
per well per ml
in KSFM or DMEM in a 24 well culture
plate and grown until 90–100% conﬂuent. Medium was then
removed and cells exposed to 0.5 and 1× MIC50 of each com-
pound for 2 min, then cells were washed gently (×3) in Hanks
balanced salt solution. The viability of the cells was assessed
using an XTT assay (0.25 mg/ml XTT and 1µM of menadione
in KSFM or DMEM), in which the cells were incubated in 5%
CO2 at 37˚C for 2 h, and the absorbance quantiﬁed at 490 nm
in an automated microtiter plate reader (Tecan Sunrise, Jen-
cons, UK). Viability was calculated based on unexposed control
cells.

CYTOKINE EXPRESSION STUDIES
OKF6 cells were grown in 12 well tissue culture trays were
seeded and grown as described above and treated with TTO

(cid:48)

and T-4-ol at 0.5× MIC50 for 2 min, washed then stimulated
with zymosan (50 µg/ml). Media and zymosan controls were
also included. Supernatants were collected after 4 and 24 h
and RNA extracted using TRIzol® according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland). Total RNA
was treated with DNase I (Promega, Southampton, UK) at 37˚C
for 30 min. RNA quality and quantity was assessed using a
NanoDrop™spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Labtech International
Ltd., Ringmer, East Sussex, UK), prior to cDNA production
using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). qPCR
was then performed using an MxPro MX3000P Quantitative
PCR machine (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) with the fol-

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For assessing the statistical signiﬁcance of observed changes in
metabolic activity and biomass of C. albicans and IL-8 protein
levels in oral keratinocyte culture ﬂuids (data that conformed
to a near normal distribution) a one-way ANOVA with Bonfer-
roni multiple comparison post-test was performed. ANOVA and
post hoc tests were also used on natural log transformations (to
normalize) of proportional data for the analysis of IL-8 mRNA
abundance in these cells. p < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. The
analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for
Windows (GraphPad Software, CA, USA).

RESULTS
TTO AND DERIVATIVE COMPONENTS ARE EFFECTIVE AGAINST
CANDIDA ALBICANS BIOFILMS
The planktonic C. albicans isolates tested were susceptible to
TTO, T-4-ol, and α-terpineol, with an MIC50 of 0.5, 0.25, and
0.25%, respectively, and an MIC90 of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.5%, respec-
tively (Table 1). There was minimal variation in susceptibility as
determined by the concentration ranges for the 100 strains tested.
These three compounds also displayed potent activity against the
69 strains capable of forming bioﬁlms, with the SMIC50 for T-4-ol
and α-terpineol showing no change when compared to median
effective planktonic concentration (SMFC50 = 0.25%). However,
the concentration of TTO required to show a similar effect was
double that required to inhibit planktonic cells (SMFC50 = 1%).
All other compounds tested showed relatively poor activity against
the isolates tested.

The bioﬁlm rate of kill for the three most effective components
(TTO, T-4-ol, and α-terpineol) at 2× SMIC50 was performed,
where time dependent killing was observed (Figure 1). TTO was
shown to reduce the viability of the bioﬁlms within 2 min by 44%,
but after 5, 15, and 60 min this had declined only slightly to 46,
56, and 65%, respectively. However, both T-4-ol and α-terpineol
displayed comparable and more effective killing, reducing the via-
bility rapidly after 2 min by approximately 55%. This anti-bioﬁlm
activity remained, reducing bioﬁlm viability by approximately 61,
75, and 94% after 5, 15, and 60 min, respectively. Both T-4-ol and
α-terpineol showed signiﬁcantly better activity than TTO only at
60 min (p < 0.001).
Inhibition of bioﬁlm formation was assessed for these three
compounds at 0.5 and 1× MIC50 by assessing bioﬁlm biomass.
It was shown for all compounds that 1× MIC50 was able to
inhibit bioﬁlm growth effectively when treated at 0, 1, and 2 h post
adhesion (8.5−12% biomass compared to control). At 4 h post
adhesion, by which time cells had began to form hyphae, treatment
with TTO, T-4-ol, and α-terpineol further suppressed bioﬁlm pro-
liferation by 71, 74, and 82% that of the control (Figure 2A). No
signiﬁcant differences were observed between the treatments at
each time point. Treatment with 0.5× MIC50 was overall less effec-
tive at inhibiting bioﬁlm growth most notably with TTO, which
displayed a time dependent reduction in inhibition, showing a
44% inhibition of cells treated at 4 h (Figure 2B). Both T-4-ol
and α-terpineol were signiﬁcantly more effective against 1 and
2 h cells (p < 0.05), inhibiting bioﬁlm formation by >80%. How-
ever, this inhibition was reduced against the 4 h cells (54 and 58%,
respectively).

TTO AND DERIVATIVE COMPONENTS ARE CELL MEMBRANE ACTIVE
Scanning electron microscopy analysis of TTO and T-4-ol treated
cells was performed. It was noted that compared to the control
(untreated) cells (Figure 3Ai), both compounds had ruptured
the cells, allowing the cell contents to leak out, giving a punc-
tured appearance (Figures 3Aii,iii). The cell damage was shown
to be more extensive for T-4-ol treated cells. Given this appear-
ance we hypothesized that cell membrane integrity had been

were incubated in ﬂat-bottomed 96-well plates for 24 h, washed in PBS, and
treated with 2× SMIC50 at 2, 5, 10, 15, and 60 min. Metabolic activity of
treated bioﬁlms was then quantiﬁed using the XTT assay by reading at
492 nm in a microtiter plate reader (FluoStar Omega, BMG Labtech). Three
isolates were used for each assay, and this was performed on two
independent occasions in triplicate. **p < 0.001. Error bars represent the

compromised. We therefore undertook PI uptake experiments, as
previously reported (Sherry et al., 2012). For TTO, PI uptake was
shown to be relatively slow, with maximal ﬂuorescence obtained
at 30 min (Figure 3B). In comparison, for T-4-ol ﬂuorescence was
shown to increase in a time dependent manner up to 40 min, twice
that of TTO, after which time this reached a plateau. These data
show similar kinetics to the time-kill data presented.

TTO AND TERPINEN-4-ol ARE BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE AGAINST
MAMMALIAN CELLS
The effect of a short exposure (2 min) of TTO and T-4-ol on
cellular toxicity was investigated. It was shown that TTO and T-4-
ol were toxic to both ﬁbroblast and epithelial cells at 1× MIC50,
reducing the viability of PRF to approximately 12% and OKF6

allowed to develop for 24 h. Resultant bioﬁlms were quantiﬁed using a

cells to 35 and 15%, respectively (Figure 4A). At 0.5× MIC50 T-
4-ol displayed no toxicity (98% viable) against PRF compared
with TTO (63% viable). Both 0.5× T-4-ol and 0.5× TTO were
non-toxic to OKF6 cells (>100% viable).
Given that the concentration of 1× MIC50 is cytotoxic, all sub-
sequent work was performed with 0.5× MIC50. Transcriptional
expression of IL-8 was assessed by qPCR, using zymosan as a
potent cell inﬂammatory agonist. Generally, greater IL-8 mRNA
levels were observed at 4 h compared to 24 h. TTO and T-4-ol pre-
treatment of the cells had no effect on the induction of the IL-8
gene when compared to the control (Figure 4B). In zymosan-
stimulated cells pre-treatment with TTO did not reduce IL-8
expression signiﬁcantly at either 4 or 24 h (p > 0.05). Although
T-4-ol showed up to a twofold reduction in IL-8 expression in
cells at both 4 and 24 h, though this reduction was not statistically
signiﬁcant (p > 0.05).

Analysis of IL-8 protein levels after 4 and 24 h stimulation
with zymosan showed that neither TTO or T-4-ol were able

to signiﬁcantly affect IL-8 levels in culture ﬂuids (p > 0.05) of
untreated and zymosan-stimulated oral keratinocytes (data shown
for zymosan only). Nevertheless, a signiﬁcant (50%) reduction in
IL-8 expression was observed in culture ﬂuids of TTO treated
zymosan-stimulated cells (p < 0.05), and a modest reduction of
approximately 14% of IL-8 was noted for T-4-ol treated zymosan-
stimulated cells (Figure 4C). These compounds had no effect on
the IL-8 ELISA (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Increasing use of conventional antifungal agents, such as azoles,
in parallel with larger groups of susceptible individuals (aging
population and more common immunosuppressive therapies) has
resulted in the emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida strains
(Sanglard and Odds, 2002; Akins, 2005; Cannon et al., 2007; Niimi
et al., 2010). Non-compliance due to toxic side-effects and palata-
bility may also exacerbate this escalating trend. Consequently,
there is a demand for novel therapies to manage these infections.
Our current and previous data investigating the effect of TTO on a
wide variety of yeast species clearly demonstrate that it is effective
against C. albicans planktonic and bioﬁlm cells (Bagg et al., 2006).
Given the complex chemical composition of TTO we aimed to
investigate key individual components to assess speciﬁc activities.

T-4-ol and α-terpineol exhibited the greatest and comparable
antifungal activity against both planktonic and sessile cells, which
has been conﬁrmed from reports elsewhere (Hammer et al., 2003a;
Mondello et al., 2006; Terzi et al., 2007). Moreover, time-kill studies
showed a rapid and sustained level of activity of both compounds,
signiﬁcantly superior to TTO at 2× MIC90 after 60 min. This supe-
rior activity was less evident during the early bioﬁlm inhibition
studies (0–2 h), however, at 4 h TTO showed a signiﬁcant decline
in its ability to inhibit bioﬁlm growth. Both T-4-ol and α-terpineol
have hydroxyl groups in their chemical structures, making them
moderately water-soluble. This allows them to diffuse through
water, enter, and destabilize cell membranes, resulting in osmotic
shock (Straede et al., 2007). This was evident from analysis of
cell membrane integrity using a PI uptake assay and microscopic
examination by SEM.

T-4-ol and α-terpineol both showed excellent activity, but the
remainder of the studies compared TTO with T-4-ol, primarily
because of the high bioavailability of the latter within TTO and
its overall antifungal proﬁle (Carson et al., 2006). Cytotoxicity was
observed at MIC50 levels for both TTO and T-4-ol, whereas at
0.5× MIC50 (concentrations able to inhibit C. albicans growth)
OKF6 cells remained viable. Previous reports have demonstrated
varying levels of cytotoxicity to primary ﬁbroblasts and primary
epithelial cells, with a 1 h exposure to 0.03%TTO shown to be
toxic (Soderberg et al., 1996). Further reports indicated that a 4 h
exposure to 0.28% TTO was required to inhibit the HeLa epithelial
cell line (Hayes et al., 1997). In addition, it was shown previously
that TTO was highly toxic to monocytes and neutrophils, but after
a prolonged 20 h exposure (Hart et al., 2000). The relevance of
this length of exposure is difﬁcult to interpret. Collectively, these
studies highlight the importance of the cell line being tested and in
what context. Given that our primary interests lay in developing a
mouthwash to prevent candidal growth as opposed to treating an
active infection, a 2 min exposure of sub-inhibitory concentrations
was deemed optimal.

These data were used to assess the impact of TTO-based
compounds on inﬂammation, using IL-8 as a biomarker. Both
transcriptional and protein analysis showed that IL-8 was regu-
lated by both compounds, with TTO showing protein reduction
of approximately 50% 24 h post treatment, whereas T-4-ol only
caused a 14% reduction. However, at 4 h post treatment T-4-ol
inhibited IL-8 protein production by 53% opposed to 16% for
TTO, although neither was signiﬁcant. The differences observed
may be accounted for by the quantitative composition of TTO,
which contains approximately 40% T-4-ol. A previous study of
LPS stimulated monocytes demonstrated a signiﬁcant IL-8 sup-
pression by 0.052% T-4-ol after 40 h (Hart et al., 2000). The
discordance with our data can be explained through differences
in concentration and exposure time. Irrespective, both studies
indicate that these molecules have the potential capacity to sup-
press inﬂammatory mediators, which are common within the oral
cavity of OPC sufferers. Indeed, there is in vivo evidence to sup-
port this. Several murine studies have shown inhibitory effects on
inﬂammatory processes, including reduced contact hypersensitiv-
ity (Brand et al., 2002a), reduced histamine-induced edema (Brand
et al., 2002b), and blocking of zymosan-induced inﬂammation
by inhaled TTO (Golab and Skwarlo-Sonta, 2007). In humans,

unexposed control cells. For cytokine studies OKF6 cells were grown in 12

nickel-induced contact hypersensitivity has been reduced by the
topical application of 100% TTO (Pearce et al., 2005). Both TTO
(Koh et al., 2002) and T-4-ol (Khalil et al., 2004) have also been
shown to reduce histamine-induced weal and ﬂare reaction in
human skin. Conversely, other studies have implicated TTO as
being pro-inﬂammatory (de Groot and Weyland, 1992; Ruther-
ford et al., 2007). Given the apparent contradictory reports in the
literature it seems prudent to focus on utilizing the most biologi-
cally active and abundant compound from TTO, i.e., T-4-ol. This
will enable investigators to determine accurately the medicinal
beneﬁts of pure T-4-ol and exclude deleterious effects caused by
the other terpenes that comprise TTO.

In summary, these studies have added to the body of in vitro
evidence indicating that TTO and some of its individual com-
ponents, speciﬁcally T-4-ol, exhibit strong antimicrobial efﬁcacy
against fungal bioﬁlms. Furthermore, this has also demonstrated
a potential bioﬁlm inhibiting activity, suggesting that this agent

may be suitable for use in prophylactic oral hygiene products such
as mouth rinses and denture cleansers, as well as treatment for
established OPC infections. The use of T-4-ol, a single component
from TTO, has advantages over the complete essential oil in terms
of product safety and consistency. Oral candidosis is a continuing
problem for cancer patients, as well as other groups of immuno-
compromised hosts. In the face of increasing resistance to azoles
and other established antifungal drugs, the need for novel pre-
ventive and therapeutic agents has never been greater. The weight
of laboratory data that has now accumulated and the anecdo-
tal reports of clinical efﬁcacy suggest that clinical trials of TTO
components, particularly T-4-ol, would be merited.
