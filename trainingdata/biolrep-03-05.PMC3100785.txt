Abstract
Medulloblastoma, a cancer of the posterior fossa, is the most common malignant brain tumor in children.
Although 80% of patients with average-risk medulloblastoma are cured, their quality of life is often
compromised by treatment-related side effects. Recently, molecular and genomic studies have shown
medulloblastoma to be a heterogeneous disease made up of distinct disease subtypes. The importance of
this finding is that response to therapy appears to be subtype-specific. Nevertheless, most patients are still
treated according to risk stratification methods based on the clinically defined presence or absence of
disseminated disease, which take no account of these newly defined subtypes. The potential, however, to
vastly reduce therapy-mediated toxicity to patients with tumor subtypes that have good outcomes, while
improving therapy through targeting for the poor responders, is now palpable. Critical to this effort will be
the ongoing refinement of our understanding of medulloblastoma subgroups at the molecular level and
the development of mouse models that faithfully recapitulate tumor subtypes.

Introduction and context
Each year, around 1,000 children (mostly between the
ages of 3 and 7 years old) worldwide will develop
medulloblastoma [1]. Although advances in neurosur-
gery, radiation oncology, and chemotherapy have led to
dramatic increases in survival rates, 20% percent will die.
For those that survive, current treatments have significant
morbidity. Surgery carries a high risk of the development
of postoperative cerebellar mutism [2]. Radiation ther-
apy leads to a broad spectrum of cognitive and endocrine
impairments [3]. Chemotherapy at the current doses
designated to treat medulloblastoma frequently results
in hearing loss, infertility, and neuropathies [4].

Not surprisingly, treatment failures have been noted to
be higher in children whose cancer has metastasized at
diagnosis [4,6]. Risk stratification is used to attempt to
identify the severity of the disease and hence how intense
the therapy should be, and consequently, clinical trials
apply higher intensity treatment to the patients with
disseminated disease than those without. Nevertheless,

the only feature associated with
metastasis is not
outcome. Medulloblastomas have also long been recog-
nized by pathologists to have differing histologic
characteristics and there are five variants recognized in
the 2007 World Health Organization classification of
central nervous system tumors [7]. Most of these variants
can be categorized into three major pathologic groups:
the classic, the nodular desmoplastic, and the large-cell
anaplastic [5,7]. When outcome is measured accordingly,
the large-cell anaplastic medulloblastomas fare the worst
and the desmoplastics the best. Furthermore, if one uses
immunohistochemical staining to identify those tumors
that localize beta-catenin (CTNNB1) to the nucleus,
another subgroup of classic histology emerges. These
patients, with nucleopositive CTNNB1 tumors, have near
complete survival on current therapy and, therefore,
carry the most favorable prognosis [8,9]. Curiously, these
tumors have been found to occur in older children
and adolescents. Nodular desmoplastic tumors, on the
other hand, generally occur in younger children [8,9].
The sum of these findings suggests that there are subtypes

of medulloblastoma that have inherent differences on
the cellular level. Unfortunately, the histologic diagnosis
of medulloblastoma is complicated by individual patho-
logists interpreting the histology differently and
difficulties in defining subtle features like anaplasia.
Improvements in technology have allowed research
to delve into tumors at the molecular level, in order
to find a more incontrovertible system for diagnosing
medulloblastoma.

Molecular characterization
What has emerged is a series of studies that identify four
to six subgroups of medulloblastoma on the basis of
molecular differences [10-12]. Despite the disparity in
the number of subtypes, there is a lot of common ground
among the studies. All describe a subtype with aberrant
Sonic Hedgehog pathway signaling (often PTCH1 muta-
tions), which has a high incidence amongst desmoplastic
tumors [10-12]. Another subtype has aberrant signaling
in the Wingless (WNT) pathway (frequently CTNNB1
mutations), a classic histology that commonly affects
older children [5,10-12]. Additionally, a less favorable
subtype emerged from the latest studies [12], which
associates MYC overexpression and amplification with
poor prognostic features (i.e., high prevalence of meta-
static disease and large-cell anaplastic histology).

All these subtypes have correlations with the histologic
variants (i.e., the Sonic Hedgehog subtype are largely
desmoplastic tumors and the MYC subtype are fre-
quently large-cell anaplastic tumors), so the molecular
profiling of these tumors should reduce the inconsis-
tencies between different pathologists’ interpretations.
Signaling pathways that promote growth (e.g., Sonic
Hedgehog, WNT, Notch, Hippo, and IGF/PI3K) or
suppress proliferation (e.g., BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7)
can now be analyzed by subtype [13,14]. Furthermore it
is likely that tumor suppressors, oncogenes, microRNAs,
and epigenetic mediators will be identified as we
continue to analyze the molecular profile and conduct
next generation sequencing on an increasing number of
tumors. Such molecular analysis of
tumors should
ultimately allow us to use targeted therapies directed at
the defective pathway.

The cellular origin of medulloblastoma
subgroups
Recent studies have suggested that medulloblastomas
arise from neuronal stem/progenitor cells in the cere-
bellum as a result of defects in genes that regulate nor-
mal growth and differentiation [5]. As such, identifying
the cell of origin of these embryonal tumors is also
an intense ongoing area of investigation. For example,
granule neuron progenitors (GNPs), a type of progenitor

cell in the brain, rely on the mitogen Sonic Hedgehog
binding with the transmembrane receptor PTCH for their
expansion [15], and it was recently demonstrated that
the subgroup of medulloblastomas with mutations that
lead to constitutive activation of this pathway originate
from GNPs [16]. Similarly, albeit in a mouse model,
medulloblastomas with mutated Ctnnb1, which resem-
ble the human WNT subgroup [17], were shown to arise
from a distinct germinal zone of the hindbrain called the
lower rhombic lip that develops into structures within
the brainstem [17]. The finding that the two best-known
subgroups originate from different developmental zones
of the hindbrain further supports the hypothesis that
different subgroups of medulloblastoma arise from diff-
erent progenitors. In addition, these progenitors differ
from each other as they appear to be uniquely susceptible
to disruption by different mutations. Unfortunately,
despite great strides into the molecular analysis of the
disease, it is still unclear from which cells the other
subgroups of medulloblastomas arise.

Targeted therapies
Our increasing understanding of Sonic Hedgehog signal-
ing has led to the discovery and development of multiple
mouse models with mutations that disrupt this pathway.
These models, in turn, have led to the discovery of drugs
that inhibit proteins activated by this pathway. Because
these compounds have worked remarkably well
to
suppress medulloblastomas in mouse models [18], they
have recently entered clinical trials [19]. Early results are
promising even in highly aggressive relapsed tumors [19].
Unfortunately, these effects are not all permanent and
even highly responsive tumors appear to be able to
generate resistance when the compounds are given as
monotherapy [20]. Like most chemotherapy, remission
may only become sustainable when given as a part of
multiregimen treatment plan.

Future directions
The information we gain from the molecular analysis of
medulloblastomas should enable physicians to better
target therapies [21,22]. Currently, one can envision how
early identification of the WNT subgroup at diagnosis
could be used to stratify these patients to a less aggressive
treatment arm, thus lessening the negative secondary
effects of treatment. Also, if proven safe, it will not be
long before inhibitors of Sonic Hedgehog signaling
can be given to patients with Sonic Hedgehog-subtype
tumors as part of their therapy. We remain, however,
desperate to find better therapy for all patients, especi-
ally those who are succumbing to high risk aggressive
tumors. This improvement in therapy can only come
from an improved understanding of the disease itself and
every effort needs to be made to increase our knowledge

of medulloblastoma at
the molecular level. Under-
standably, the molecular defect in all the medullo-
blastoma subtypes will enable us to develop new and
improved mouse models that recapitulate the human
disease, which in turn will lead to targeted treatment
with the potential to cure all the forms of this once
devastating disease.
