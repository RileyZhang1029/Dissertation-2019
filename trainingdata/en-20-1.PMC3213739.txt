ABSTRACT

to 

tried 

inhibitors 

(MAO-I)  belong 

the  earliest  drugs 

Monoamine  oxidase 

in 
Parkinson’s  disease  (PD).  They  have  been  used  with  or  without  levodopa  (L-DOPA). 
Non-selective  MAO-I  due  to  their  side-effect/adverse  reaction  profile,  like  tranylcypromine 
have  limited  use  in  the  treatment  of  depression  in  PD,  while  selective,  reversible  MAO-A 
inhibitors  are  recommended  due  to  their  easier  clinical  handling.  For  the  treatment  of 
akinesia  and  motor  fluctuations  selective  irreversible  MAO-B  inhibitors  selegiline  and 
rasagiline  are  recommended.  They  are  safe  and  well  tolerated  at  the  recommended 
daily  doses.  Their  main  differences  are  related  to  (1)  metabolism,  (2)  interaction  with 
CYP-enzymes  and  (3)  quantitative  properties  at  the  molecular  biological/genetic  level. 
Rasagiline  is  more  potent  in  clinical  practise  and  has  a  hypothesis  driven  more 
favourable  side  effect/adverse  reaction  profile  due  to  its  metabolism  to  aminoindan. 
Both  selegiline  and  rasagiline  have  a  neuroprotective  and  neurorestaurative  potential.   
A  head-to  head  clinical  trial  would  be  of  utmost  interest  from  both  the  clinical  outcome 
and  a  hypothesis-driven  point  of  view.  Selegiline  is  available  as  tablet  and  melting 
tablet  for  PD  and  as  transdermal  selegiline  for  depression,  while  rasagiline  is  marketed 
as  tablet  for  PD.  In  general,  the  clinical  use  of  MAO-I  nowadays  is  underestimated. 
There  should  be  more  efforts  to  evaluate  their  clinical  potency  as  antidepressants  and 
antidementive  drugs  in  addition  to  the  final  proof  of  their  disease-modifying  potential.  In 
line  with  this  are  recent  innovative  developments  of  MAO-I  plus  inhibition  of  acetyl-
choline  esterase  for  Alzheimer’s  disease  as  well  as  combined  MAO-I  and  iron  chelation 
for  PD.

substrates  are  noradrenaline,  adrenaline,  dopamine, 
β-phenylethylamine  (PEA)  and  serotonin.  These 
substrates  are  underlying  in  the  biochemical  patho-
logy  of  “depression”  and  Parkinson’s  disease  (PD). 
The  deficiency  of  serotonin,  noradrenaline  and  dopa-
mine  builds-up  the  hypothesis  of  “depression”  while 
a  loss  of  dopamine,  noradrenaline  and  serotonin  is 
the  biochemical  basis  of  degenerative  processes 
underlying  PD.  Therefore,  supplementation  of  defi-
cient biogenic amine neurotransmitters with 3,4-dihydroxy-

2 Peter  Riederer  and  Gerd  Laux

phenylalanin  (L-DOPA)  has  been  established  as 
early  as  the  late  50th  and  early  60th  of  the  last 
century  including  the  use  of  MAO-inhibitors.  This 
class  of  psychopharmacological  active  compounds 
inhibits  the  break-down  of  biogenic  amine  neuro-
transmitters  and  thus  increase  their  concentration  in 
the  synaptic  cleft  and  at  respective  postsynaptic 
receptor  sites.  A  mood  elevating  effect  in  patients 
with  tuberculosis  after  treatment  with  iproniazid  was 
first  described  by  Kline  (1958).  In  PD  the  first 
reports  were  published  by  Sano  (1960;  Foley  et  al., 
2000)  using  iproniazid  and  pheniprazine  alone  or  in 
combination  with  D,L-DOPA  in  a  small  number  of 
patients,  Degkwitz  et  al.  (1960),  who  used  iproniazid 
in  combination  with  L-DOPA  and  in  reserpin  treated 
patients with schizophrenia and Birkmayer, Hornykiewicz 
and  Bernheimer,  who  tried  a  variety  of  compounds 
like  harmine,  isocarboxazid  and  other  MAO-I’s  (Bern-
heimer  et  al.,  1961;  Birkmayer  and  Hornykiewicz 
1961;  1962;  1964)  alone  or  in  combination  with  L- 
DOPA  in  PD.  The  effects  were  mild  or  not  existing 
when  these  MAO-I  were  given  alone.  However  all 
theses  early  reports  agree  that  MAO-I  potentiated 
the  effect  of  (D),  L-DOPA  but 
intensified  also 
adverse  reactions.  Further  examination  and  post 
mortem  studies  gave  evidence  that  MAO-I  given 
shortly  before  patients  deaths  were  restoring  the 
levels  of  noradrenaline  and  serotonin  with  no 
significant  effect  on 
the  concentration  of  brain 
dopamine  (Bernheimer  et  al.,  1962;  1963).  This 
data  pointed  to  a  combination  therapy  of  L-DOPA 
and  MAO-I  already  in  the  early  60th  of  the  last 
century.  An  extensive  description  of  detailed  historical 
aspects  of  MAO  and  its  inhibitors  is  given  in  the 
excellent  overview  on  treatment  strategies  in  PD  by 
Foley  (2001).  A  further  break-through  was  the  dis-
covery  of  multiple  forms  of  MAO,  MAO-A  and 
MAO-B,  by  Johnston  (1968).  MAO-A  deaminates 
especially  serotonin,  noradrenaline  and 
tyramine 
and  is  inhibited  selectively  at  low  concentrations  (μM) 
of  clorgyline  while  MAO-B  is  insensitive  to  clorgyline 
and  in  the  human  brain  desaminates  PEA  and  to  a 
high  degree  dopamine  (Glover  et  al.,  1977).  The 
first  selective  MAO-B-I  was  L-deprenyl 
(E-250, 
L-deprenyl,  selegiline),  synthezised  by  Zoltan  Ecseri 
in  1962,  patented  as  antidepressant  in  1965,  1966 
and  developed  by  Jozsef  Knoll  as 
“psychic 
energizer  (Knoll  et  al.,  1965).”  The  combination  of 

in 

in  PD  and  especially 

selegilines  selective  MAO-B-I  properties  and  the 
short-lasting  stimulant  effect  of  one  of  its  meta-
bolites,  metamphetamine,  (later  proved  to  be  also  a 
reversible  MAO-inhibitor  see  also  Foley  2001  for 
details  of  such  early  developments)  was  indeed  a 
concept  to  put  forward  new  antidepressant  agents 
(Varga  and  Tringer,  1967).  Knoll  mentioned  in  his 
1965  publication  that  selegiline  does  not  increase 
motility  and  lowers  blood  pressure  in  experimental 
animals.  Using  tyramine  (a  MAO-A  and  -B  substrate) 
it  became  evident  that  selegiline  antagonizes  the 
socalled  “cheese-effect”  (increase  of  blood  pressure 
noteable  especially  after  consumption  of 
larger 
amounts  of  cheese  in  patients treated with unselective 
or  MAO-A-inhibitors)  (Knoll  and  Magyar,  1972).  As 
dopamine  in  rodent  brain  is  s  preferred  MAO-A 
substrate  an  effect  of  MAO-inhibitors  on  motility 
(see  above)  has  not  been  observed.  PD,  therefore, 
was  not  the  focus  for  using  MAO-B-I  as  therapeutic 
strategy.  The  suggestion  in  late  1974  for  selegilines 
use 
treating  ON-OFF 
symptoms  by  one  of  use  (PR)  was  based  on  (1) 
the  early  and  in  principle  beneficial  effects  of  MAO-I 
when  combined  with  L-DOPA  (see  above),  (2)  the 
effects  of  selegiline  in  antagonizing  the  cheese- 
effect  and  (3) 
in 
for  MAO-B. 
humans  might  well  be  a  substrate 
Convincing  Moussa  Youdim  about  using  selegiline  for 
a  first  trial  in  PD  patients  in  PD  he  agreed  to 
provide  Walther  Birkmayer  and  myself  (P.R.)  with 
some  grams  of  selegiline  that  he  had  obtained  from 
Josef  Knoll.  The  trial  was  showing  a  beneficial  effect 
in  the  symptomology  of  PD  (Birkmayer  et  al.,  1975; 
1977;  Foley,  2001;  for  historical  notes  see  Riederer 
2004;  Youdim,  2006).  Later  (Birkmayer  et  al.,  1983; 
1985)  we  provided  evidence  for  selegiline  having 
neuroprotective  action,  a  concept  that  is  still  followed 
and  seems  to  be  proven  by  the  follow-up  pro-
pargylaminoderivative  rasagiline  as  shown  recently 
in  the  ADAGIO-study  (Olanow  et  al.,  2008;  2009).
    The 
innovating  basic  research  and  beneficial 
actions  of  selegiline  in  PD  were  responsible  for 
intensive  MAO-I  drug  developments  for  both  PD 
and  “depression”.  In  this  review  we  present  the 
major  compounds  currently  being  used  as  well  as 
an  outlook  of  further  such  developments.

MAO-I  in  clinical  practise

    Monoamine  oxidase  (MAO)  inhibitors  (MAOIs)  at 
present  can  be  classified  into  3  types:

ㆍOlder,  irreversible  nonselective  agents  such  as 

phenelzine  and  tranylcypromine

ㆍIrreversible,  selective  drugs  (MAO-B-I’s)  such 

activity  disorder  and  cognitive  deficits  in  dementia 
for  moclobemide  (Chan-Palay,  1992;  Berlin  et  al., 
1995).

ㆍReversible,  selective  MAO-A  inhibitors  (RIMAs 
=  reversible  inhibitors  of  MAO-A)  such  as  moclo-

1995)

    The  clinical  indications  and  efficacy  of  the  MAOIs 
are  established  for  disorders  as  follows:
    ㆍParkinson’s  disease  (PD)
    ㆍDepressive  disorders
    ㆍAnxiety  disorders  (social  phobia,  panic  disorder, 

PTSD)

    Other  potential  therapeutic  uses  and  indications 
can  be  smoking  cessation,  attention  deficit  hyper-

    Both,  selegiline  and  rasagiline  (Table  1)  are  bene-
ficial  in  treating  motor  symptoms  in  PD  as  mono-
therapy  and  in  combination  with  L-DOPA  and  a 
decarboxylase  inhibitor.  Rasagiline  is  more  effective 
in  this  regard  as  shown  also  in  the  daily  dosis 
necessary  for  a  symptomatic  effect:  5∼10  mg/day 
selegiline,  1  mg/day  rasagiline.  Long-term  trials  with 
selegiline  point  to  the  fact  that  30∼40%  of  the  daily 
L-DOPA  dosis  can  be  spared  when  combined  with 
the  MAO-B-I  (Szeleny,  1993;  Lees  et  al.,  1995; 
Myllylä  et  al.,  1997).  It  is  not  far-fetched  to  assume, 
that  PEA,  which  increases  after  selegiline  treatment 
in  brain  tissue  (Reynolds  et  al.,  1978)  and  by  this 
exerts  dopamine  release-promoting  properties,  contri-
butes  to  dopamine’s  behavioural  effects  including 
improvement  of  motility  (Foley,  2001;  Gerlach  et  al., 
2007;  Riederer,  2009).
    There  is  overwhelming  evidence  that  selegiline 
has  beneficial  effects  on  motoricity  and  motorfluc-
tuations  as  shown  already  in  the  first  clinical  trial 
(Birkmayer  et  al.,  1975)  and  in  follow-up  clinical 
studies  as  summarized  by  Gerlach  et  al.  (2007).
    Rasagiline  effects  on  motoricity  are  even  stronger 
as  shown  by  the  TEMPO-(Parkinson  Study  Group, 
2002;  2004),  PRESTO- 
(Parkinson-Study-Group, 
2005),  LARGO-  (Rascol  et  al.,  2005)  and  ADAGIO- 
(Olanow  et  al.,  2008;  2009)  studies.
    In  all  these  and  additional  clinical  studies  (eg 
Rabey  et  al.,  2000;  Thebault  et  al.,  2004;  Rascol, 

4 Peter  Riederer  and  Gerd  Laux

2005;  Biglan  et  al.,  2006;  Siderowf  and  Stern, 
2006)  it  could  be  shown  that  rasagiline  is  well 
tolerated,  safe,  improves  motor  symptoms,  prevents 
motor  complications  in  PD,  has  beneficial  effects  on 
quality  of  life  parameters,  is  effective  as  mono-
therapy  or  in  adjunctions  to  L-DOPA-therapy,  is 
beneficial  in  early  and  late  stages  of  PD,  is  safe 
when  combined  with  all  other  PD-relevant  therapies 
including  COMT-inhibitors  and  may  have  disease- 
modifying  properties.

Neuroprotection  and  disease-modification

    Selegiline  and  rasagiline  are  “suizide-inhibitors” 
which  inhibit  the  enzyme  irreversibly  and  for  a 
rather  long  time.  Therefore  only  newly  synthesized 
enzyme  will  recover  MAO  activity  sufficient  to  meta-
bolize  its  substrates  in  an  adequate  amount.  Positron- 
emission  tomography  (PET)  studies  have  shown  a 

biological  half-life  time  (HLT)  of  MAO-B  recovery 
after  selegiline  -  (Fowler  et  al.,  1994)  or  rasagiline- 
(Freedman  et  al.,  2005)  induced  blockade  of  about 
30∼40  days.  As  described  earlier  (Riederer  and 
Lachenmayer,  2003;  Gerlach  et  al.,  2007)  PET- 
studies  are  only  in  part  suitable  to  detect  the  HLT 
of  MAO-inhibitors  as  they  only  detect  the  distri-
bution  of  radiolabeled  inhibitor  and  its  metabolites. 
In  addition  the  exact  kinetic  properties  underlying 
these  PET-studies  have  been  described  only  at 
random  (Arnett  et  al.,  1987).  In  contrast,  measure-
ment  of  PEA,  the  pure  MAO-B  substrate,  in  the 
urine  of  healthy  individuals  after  selegiline  dosing 
showed  recovery  (decline)  of  this  amine  concentration 
to  normal  values  already  2∼3  days  after  withdrawal 
of  selegiline  (Clarke  et  al.,  2001).  Such  data  agree 
with  other  pharmacological  studies  as  described  by 
Riederer  and  Lachenmayer  (2003)  and  point  to  the

the 

conclusion  that  the  HLT  of  MAO-B  recovery  after 
irreversible  inhibition  by  selegiline  is  about  7  days. 
According  to  Green  et  al.  (1977)  an  80%  inhibition 
of  MAO-isoenzymes  is  necessary  to  increase  con-
centration  of  biogenic  amines  significantly.  This 
means  that  newly  synthesized  enzyme  in  the  range 
of  20  to  30%  is  sufficient  to  lose  any  symptomatic 
behavioural  effect  after  withdrawal  of  any  MAO- 
inhibitor.  In  line  with  this  are  studies  by  Youdim  and 
Tipton  (2002)  who  could  not  detect  selegiline- 
induced  stereotyped  behaviour  due  to  PEA  increase 
4  days  after  withdrawal  of  selegiline.  At  this  time 
MAO-B  recovery  was  already  20%.  Taking  these 
findings  into  account  a  wash-out  phase  of  two 
weeks  or  after  selegiline/rasagiline  withdrawal  is 
sufficient  to  avoid  any  symptomatic  effect  of  these 
the 
MAO-I’s.  Therefore,

selegiline  cannot  be  excluded 
(Riederer  and 
Lachenmayer,  2003;  Gerlach  et  al.,  2007).  Table  2 
(taken  in  part  from  Riederer  and  Lachenmayer  2003 
with  permission)  illustrates  the  major  outcomes  of 
the  most 
trials  with 
selegiline.  While  treatment  of  patients  in  an  early 
phase  of  PD  with  selegiline  shows  sufficient  results 
regarding  motoricity  and  disease-modification  the 
unconclusive 
the  DATATOP-follow-up 
clinical  trials  may  demonstrate  a  bias  in  severity  of 
patients  grouping  as  given  in  the  first  follow-up 
study  (Parkinson  Study  Group,  1996a)  or  that  the 
patients  have  non-response  based  on  disease- 
progression  and/or  accompanying  diseases  (Table 
3).  As  there  were  no  final  conclusions  about  the 
neuroprotective  effect  of  selegiline  the  development 

interpretations  of 

important  clinical 

results  of 

long-term 

follow-up 

trials 

of  more  efficient  clinical  trial  designs  have  been 
investigated 
including  PET-controlled  studies  as 
shown  with  dopaminergic  agonists.  More  recently 
the  “delayed-start  study  design”  has  been  developed 
as  discussed  by  D’Agostino  (2009).  Rasagiline  has 
been  the  first  drug  tested  in  such  clinical  trial.  In 
fact  the  ADAGIO-study  has  given  profound  evi-
dence  for  a  disease-modifying  effect  of  1  mg/day 
rasagiline,  while  there  was  not  such  benefit  at  a  2 
mg/day  dosis  (Table  4).  Although  -  and  in  com-
parison  to  the  negative  outcome  of  a  delayed- 
start-study  with  pramipexol  (Schapira  et  al.,  2009)  - 
there  is  ample  evidence  for  a  significant  disease- 
modification  with  low  dosis  rasagiline  this  clinical 
outcome  has  been  questioned  recently  (Ahlskog 
and  Uitti,  2010;  Sampaio  and  Ferreira,  2010; 
Schwarzschild,  2010).  Caslake  et  al. 
(2009) 
conclude  in  their  Cochrane  Database  report:  “MAO-B 
inhibitors  are  one  option  for  the  early  treatment  of 
PD  although  they  have  weaker  symptomatic  effects 
than  levodopa  and  dopamine  agonists.  They  may 
reduce  the  rate  of  motor  fluctuations  compared  with 
initial 
fewer 
significant  adverse  effects  than  the  older  agonists 
but  data  are 
to  provide  reliable  con-
clusions”.
    Neuroprotective,  neurorestaurative  and  disease- 
modifying  effects  of  selegiline  and  rasagiline  are 
substantiated  by  in  vitro-as  well  as  in  vivo  experi-
mental  studies  (Table  5).  There  is  ample  evidence 
that  compounds  attached 
to  a  propargylamino 
group  induce  molecular  processes  which  act  against 
cell  death  mechanisms  like  apoptosis,  excitotoxicity 
and  oxidative  stress.  These  are  non-MAO  based 
mechanisms  and  they  act  not  only  on  a  functional 
level  but  rather  on  influencing  gene  expression  and 

therapy  and  may  have

Depression  in  PD

    With  a  prevalence  of  approximately  40%  depression 
is  considered  to  be  the  most  frequent  psychiatric 

manifestation  in  PD  (Burn,  2002;  McDonald  and 
DeLong,  2003;  Veazey  et  al.,  2005).  Particular 
clinical  features  of  the  depressive  symptom  profile 
in  patients  with  PD  have  been  described  (Wermuth 
and  Bech,  2006;  Brand  et  al.,  2007)  and  recommen-
dations 
(Burn 
2002).  About  50%  of  the  patients  meet  the  criteria 
for  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD),  50%  have 

recognition  given 

towards  better 

minor  depression  or  dysthymia  (Chaudhuri  et  al., 
2006).  Depression  in  PD  is  associated  with  increased 
disability  and  reduced  quality  of  life,  the  impact  of 
depressive  symptoms  in  early  PD  especially  should 
not  be  underestimated  (Ravina  et  al.,  2007).

MAOIs  in  depression

    While  early  studies  suggested  that  MAOIs  were 
not  as  effective  as  other  antidepressants,  more 
recent  studies  have  demonstrated  that,  when  pre-
scribed 
in  adequate  dosages,  phenelzine  and 
tranylcypromine  are  as  effective  as  other  anti-
depressants  (Pare,  1985).  Table  6  gives  a  summary

of  important  controlled  studies  with  tranylcypromine. 
In  a  recent  study  tranylcypromine,  60  mg  daily,  was 
found  effective  in  the  treatment  of  panic  disorder 
and  social  anxiety  disorder  comorbidity  (Nardi  et  al., 
2010).
    The  main  indications  for  the  classical  irreversible 
MAOIs  are  subgroups  of  depression  such  as 
atypical  depression,  dysthymia  or  for  patients  who 
do  not  respond  to  reuptake  inhibitors,  so-called 
therapy  resistant  depressions  (Nolen  et  al.,  1994; 
Paykel,  1995;  Bauer  et  al.,  2002).
    The 
therapeutic  efficacy  of  moclobemide  has 
been  assessed  in  numerous  controlled  studies  com-
paring  it  with  placebo  and  established  antidepressants 
(for  reviews  see  Laux,  1989;  Fitton  et  al.,  1992; 
Fulton  and  Benfield,  1996;  Laux  et  al.,  2002).  An 
overview  of  the  most  relevant  trials    is  given  in 
Table  7.
    Large  trials  in  patients  with  major  depression 
have  generally  confirmed 
the  efficacy  of 
moclobemide  is  equivalent  to  that  of  TCAs  beside 
some  negative  studies.  Moclobemide  treatment  was 
usually  fixed  up  to  300,  400  or  600  mg/day.  It 
should  be  noted,  however,  that  the  use  of  dosages 
of  up  to  900  mg/d  has  been  established  due  to 
clinical  experience  nowadays  particularly  in  patients 
with  refractory  depression  (Guentert  et  al.,  1995).  A 
meta-analysis  of 
that 
higher  dosages  (＞450  mg/day)  of  moclobemide  are 
needed  for  full  therapeutic  effect  in  patients  with 
severe  depression  (Angst  et  al.,  1995).
    Subgroup  analyses  of  patients  revealed  moclo-

bemide  to  be  effective  in  patients  with  dysthymia  or 
atypical  depression  especially  (Lonnqvist  et  al., 
1995). 
    Several  trials  have  evaluated  moclobemide  alone 
or  in  combination  with  TCAs  or  SSRIs  in  the 
treatment  of  refractory  depression  (Bakish  et  al., 
1995)  reporting  positive  results.  These  data  are 
limited  and  great  caution  is  necessary  because  of 
the  potential 
induce  the  serotonin  syndrome 
when  combining  moclobemide  with  serotoninergic 
drugs.
    Uncontrolled  long  term  follow-up  studies  demon-
strated  continued  effectiveness  of  moclobemide 
over  the  treatment  period  of  1  year  with  more  than 
60%  of  patients  having  continued  response  (Fulton 
and  Benfield,  1996).  The  role  of  MAOIs  in  mainte-

to 

nance  treatment  of  depression  still  has  to  evaluated 
(Kennedy,  1997).
    MAO-B  inhibitors  like  selegiline  in  high  dosage 
have  been  used  in  therapy-refractory  depressions 
probably  due  to  non-selective  MAO  effects  (see 
review  Laux,  1993).  Recently,  transdermal  selegiline 
has  been  approved  and  released  in  the  USA  for 
treatment  of  major  depression  with  a  target  dose  of 
6  mg/24  hours.  This  dosage  and  application  over-
comes  the  MAO-B  selectivity  and  leads  to  MAO-A 
inhibition,  seen  to  be  necessary  for  antidepressive 
effects.  In  several  controlled  studies  selegiline  trans-
dermal  system  exhibited  significant  treatment  effects 
on  MDD 
including  core  depression  symptoms, 
vegetative  symptoms  and  motor  retardation  (Frampton 
and  Plosker,  2007;  Robinson  et  al.,  2007).  A  combi-

nation  of  selegiline  and  5-hydroxytryptophan  has  been 
tested  in  a  pilot  study  and  proved  antidepressant 
efficacy  (Mendlewicz  and  Youdim,  1978).

Treatment  with  antidepressants  and  MAOIs  in 
PD

reuptake 

inhibitors 

    The  scientific  knowledge  about  the  treatment  with 
antidepressant  drugs  among  PD  patients  is  nearly 
missing.  A  pharmaco-epidemiological  study  in  Dan-
mark  showed  that  persons  treated  with  antiparkinson 
drugs  have  higher  frequency  of  antidepressant  drug 
treatment  than  have  controls  (Brandt-Christensen  et 
al.,  2007).  Most  authors  conclude,  that  recommen-
dations  for  the  optimal  drug  treatment  of  depression 
in  PD  are  difficult  to  give  (Burn,  2002).  Serotonin 
selective 
(SSRIs)  are  given 
frequently,  the  benefit  of  SSRI  treatment  in  PD  has 
not  been  established,  however  (Wermuth  and  Bech, 
2006).
    Thirty-seven  patients  with  early  PD  have  been 
treated  successfully  with 
tranylcypromine  (TCP), 
parkinsonian  symptoms  improved  slightly,  follow-up 
after  1.5  years  on  average  revealed  only  slight 
worsening  (Fahn  and  Chouinard,  1998).  No  other 
studies  have  been  reported  with  TCP  so  far.
    Ten  patients  with  PD  have  been  treated  success-
fully  with  moclobemide  vs.  moclobemide  with  selegiline 
under  tyramine  restriction  (Steuer  and  Ballering, 
1997).  Sufficient  data  allowing  conclusions  are 
missing.

Dosage  and  administration

    The  recommended  initial  dosage  of    tranylcypro-
mine  is  10∼20  mg/day,  of  moclobemide  300  to  450 
mg/day,  given  in  2  to  3  divided  doses.  Subsequent 
dosage  increase  to  a  maximum  of  60  mg/day,  900 
mg/day  respectively,  are  made  as  clinically  indicated 
(Beckmann  and  Laux,  1991;  Fitton  et  al.,  1992). 
Clinical  experience  and  studies  in  the  last  years 
clearly  have  shown  the  necessity  of  higher  dosage 
of  moclobemide  pointing  out 
lack  of  early 
sufficient  dose-finding  studies.  Recommended  daily 
doses  of  phenelzine  are  30  to  90  mg,  of  isocarbo-
xazid  30  to  60  mg,  respectively.
    Dietary  restrictions  are  essential  for  tranylcypromine 
(tyramine-rich  food),  unnecessary  for  moclobemide 
taken  at  the  end  of  a  meal.  A  2  week  wash-out 
period  is  required  for  switching  between  tranylcy-

the 

MAO-I  in  Parkinson’s  Disease 9

promine  and  other  classes  of  antidepressants,  not 
between  moclobemide  and  other  antidepressants.
    In  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment,  trany-
lcypromine  and  moclobemide  dosages  should  be 
reduced  by  one-third  to  one-half  in  such  patients 
(Atkinson  and  Ditman,  1965;  Fitton  et  al.,  1992).
    The  target  dose  of  selegiline  transdermal  (not 
released  in  Europe  so  far)  is  6  mg/24  hours.

Tolerability  and  safety

frequently 

the  potential 

for  dangerous 

reported  adverse  effects 

    The  most  frequent  adverse  effects  of  irreversible 
MAOIs  are  orthostatic  hypotension,  sleep  disturbances 
and  nervousness/agitation  (Remick  et  al.,  1989). 
The  mostly  limiting  factor  in  the  use  of  these  MAOIs 
is 
interactions  with 
tyramine-rich 
foods  and  sympathomimetic  and 
serotoninergic  substances.  Therefore,  prescription  is 
only  possible  to  patients  being  strongly  compliant 
with  dietary  restrictions.  In  the  case  of  RIMAs  like 
moclobemide  there  is  no  need  for  dietary  restrictions. 
For  “selegiline  transdermal  system”  tyramine  dietary 
restrictions  are  not  needed.  The  incidence  of  the 
most 
from 
patients  receiving  MAOIs  are  summarised  in  Table 
7.
    Insomnia  and  impotency  in  men  have  been  the 
most  frequent  side  effects  of  TCP  in  patients  with 
early  PD  (Fahn  and  Chouinard,  1998). 
    Unlike  nonselective,  irreversible  MAOIs  and  tricy-
clics,  moclobemide  has  little  effect  on  the  cardio-
vascular  system  and  lacks  anticholinergic  properties 
associated  with  TCAs  (Moll  et  al.,  1994;  Fulton  and 
Benfield,  1996).  In  almost  all  controlled  clinical  studies 
comparing  moclobemide  with  TCAs  moclobemide 
showed  clearly  superior  tolerability  (Versiani  et  al., 
1990;  Fitton  et  al.,  1992;  Fulton  and  Benfield,  1996). 
Headache,  insomnia  and  agitation  were  the  only 
one  side  effects  being  reported  more  frequently  with 
moclobemide  compared  to  re-uptake  inhibiting  anti-
depressants.  Dizziness  and  nausea  have  been 
noticed  additionally.  No  systematic  changes  in  blood 
pressure  were  observed  with  moclobemide,  whereas 
increases  in  both  blood  pressure  and  pulse  were 
recorded  for  tranylcypromine  (Laux  et  al.,  1996). 
Body  weight  gain  has  been  observed  with  phenel-
zine  and  isocarboxazid,  no  clearcut  cases  with 
tranylcypromine  or  moclobemide  have  been  reported 
(Cantu  and  Korek,  1988).  Compared 
to  SSRIs

moclobemide  showed  fewer  gastrointestinal  adverse 
effects  and  sexual  dysfunction  have  not  been 
reported  with  moclobemide  (Philipp  et  al.,  1999).
    Regarding  cognitive  functions  data  in  favour  of 
moclobemide  compared  to  other  antidepressants 
are  available:  Behavioural 
toxicity  assessed  by 
choice  reaction  time  is  very  low  or  missing,  psy-

tively  perhaps  even  improved  (Hindmarch  et  al., 
1992).
    The  principal  side  effects  of  selegiline  transdermal 
were local dermal reactions and  (dose-related) insom-
nia  (Robinson  and  Amsterdam,  2008).
    After  ingestion  of  up  to  20  g  of  moclobemide  no 
fatalities  were  observed,  so  moclobemide  can  be 
considered  as  a  ‘safe’  antidepressant  (DeJonghe 
and  Swinkels,  1992;  Chen  and  Ruch,  1993).  Several 
fatal  overdoses  have  been  reported  when  moclo-
bemide  was  combined  with  serotoninergic  antidepre-
ssants  like  citalopram,  clomipramine  or  fluoxetine 
due  to  occurrence  of  a  serotonin  syndrome  (Neu-
vonen  et  al.,  1993).  In  contrast,  irreversible  MAOIs 
like  tranylcypromine  must  be  regarded  as  less  safe 
regarding  to  the  fatal  toxicity  index  (Henry  et  al., 
1995).

Side  effects  of  selegiline  and  rasagiline

    Selegiline  is  well  tolerated.  Side  effects/adverse 
reactions  like  sleeplessness,  nausea,  vomiting,  dizzi-
ness,  dry  mouth,  orthostatic  hypotension  and  dyski-
nesias  have  been  all  observed  in  the  range  of  2∼
5%  of  PD  patients  (Parkinson-Study-Group,  1993; 
Reichmann  et  al.,  2002)  which  is  comparable  to 
placebo.  Other  side  effects  like  headache,  heart 
beating,  dyspnoe,  edema,  confusion,  micturition 
dysfunction,  loss  of  appetite  and  anxiety  are  even 
more  rare  and  below  2%  (Reichmann  et  al.,  2002).
    Rasagiline
    Adverse  reactions  as  seen  with  other  dopami-
nergic  drugs,  like  nausea,  vomiting,  orthostatic  hypo-
tension,  somnolence,  hallucinations  and  dyskinesias 
are  tolerable  in  most  cases.  Vomiting  was  noteable 
at  1  mg/day  in  the  PRESTO-study,  as  was  the 
occurrence  of  dyskinesias  but  such  adverse 
reactions  have  not  been  described  in  other  clinical 
trials  like  the  LARGO-trial.  Cognitive  and  behavioural 
symptoms  of  PD  are  not  changed/worsened  at  1 
mg/day  rasagiline  (Elmer  et  al.,  2006).

    Although  interactions  may  be  suggested  when 
MAO-B  inhibitors  are  combined  with  COMT-inhibitors, 
such  adverse  reactions  have  not  been  reported  to 
be  of  relevance.  In  fact  rasagiline  is  effective  and 
well  tolerated  in  PD  patients  with  L-DOPA  induced 
motor  fluctuations  receiving  entacapone  (Elmer  et 
al.,  2006).

The  cardiovascular  risk  in  selegiline  and 
rasagiline  treated  PD

    Selegiline  is  metabolized  mainly  to  desmethyl- 
selegiline,  L-amphetamine  and  L-metamphetamine. 
Given  these  facts  there  was  always  a  profound 
discussion  about  the  contribution  of  these  meta-
bolites  to  selegiline’s  clinical  symptomatic  effects 
(Reynolds  et  al.,  1978;  Elsworth  et  al.,  1982)  and 
selegilines  adverse 
reactions,  predominantly  of 
cardiovascular  origin  (Churchyard  et  al.,  1997).  L- 
Amphetamine  has  about  a  ten  times  lower  activity 
on  the  peripheral  sympathetic  system  compared  to 
D-amphetamine.  On 
the  other  hand,  both  are 
equipotent 
in  blocking  striatal  dopamine  uptake 
(Coyle  and  Snyder,  1969).  A  clinical  trial  of  daily  10 
mg  selegiline  vs.  the  calculated  dosis  and  ratio  of 
L-amphetamine  and  L-  metamphetamine 
in  PD 
patients  came  to  the  conclusion  that  selegiline  did 
show  antiakinetic  efficacy  while  the  metabolites  did 
not  (Elsworth  et  al.,  1982).  Therefore,  selegiline  is 
not  acting  via  the  amphetamine  metabolites.  Also, 
from  the  side  effect  profile  as  reported  in  the  large 
selegiline  based  trials  there  is  no  evidence  for 
enhanced  cardiovascular  risk  (eg.  Parkinson  Study 
Group,  1989;  1993).  This  holds  true  also  when 
selegiline 
treatment  based  on 
L-DOPA  and  dopaminergic 
receptor  agonists. 
However,  head-to  head  comparison  is  missing.
    Nevertheless,  to  avoid  further  such  discussion  a 
sublingual  galenic  form  of  selegiline  treatment  has 
been  developed  named  Zydis-selegiline  (Clarke  et 
al.,  2003a;  2003b).  This  “melting-tablet”  avoids  a  first- 
pass  effect  and  therefore  a  significant  break-down 
to  L-amphetamine  and  L-metamphetamine  in  the 
range  of  90%.  A  reduction  of  the  daily  dosis  of  10 
mg  selegiline  to  1,  25  mg  selegiline  is  advised.  The 
bioavailability  of  selegiline  when  given  as  “melting- 
tablet”  is  more  homogene  and  better  reproduceable 
compared  to  the  peroral  type  of  application  (Clarke 
et  al.,  2003a;  2003b).  In  addition  a  transdermal 

is  compared 

to 

first-pass  biotransformation 

galenic  form  of  selegiline  has  been  developed  for 
the  treatment  of  major  depression  again  reducing 
selegilines 
(Frampton 
and  Plosker,  2007;  Robinson  et  al.,  2007). 
    Melting  tablet  and  transdermal  selegiline  avoid 
first-pass  metabolism,  cause  higher  drug  availability 
in  MAO-B  preferring  organs  and  reduce  the  concen-
tration  of  metabolites.  Increased  drug  concentration 
may  cause  significant  inhibition  of  both  MAO-B  and 

−A  in  brain  but  not  in  the  periphery.  This  explains 

selegilines  antidepressant  activity  when  combined 
with  5-hydroxytryptophan  without  the  cheese-effect 
and  without  the  serotonin  syndrome  (Mendlewicz 
and  Youdim,  1978).
    Under  clinical  conditions  selegiline  is  not  more 
“toxic”  than  other  dopaminergic  treatment  strategies. 
In  fact  the  side  effect  and  adverse  reaction  profile 
of  selegiline  has  been  evaluated  as  being  well 
tolerated  and  “mild”  compared  to  other  PD  treatment 
strategies,  eg.  orthostatic 
reactions  have  been 
noteable  in  only  3,  7%  of  patients  (Reichmann  et 
al.,  2002).
    It  should  be  mentioned  that  L-amphetamine  is  in 
clinical  use  for  the  treatment  of  attention-deficit- 
hyperactivity  syndrome  (ADHD)  without  major  side 
effects.  In  line  with  this  are  several  studies  as 
summarized  by  Reidenberg  (1994)  showing  no 
abuse  liability  of  selegiline.
    The  contribution  of  desmethylselegiline  (DMS)  to 
the  effects  of  selegiline  has  been  underestimated 
so  far.  DMS  is  a  weak  inhibitor  of  MAO-B  and 
seems to have glutathione related properties (Heinonen, 
1997;  Heinonen  et  al.,  1997).
    In  contrast  to  selegiline,  rasagiline  is  not  meta-
bolized  to  amphetamine.  The  main  metabolite  of 
rasagiline  is  aminoindan.  Therefore  any  cardiovascular 
responses  of  rasagiline  are  neglectible  as  shown  in 
animal  studies  (Finberg  et  al.,  2006)  and  in  all 
clinical 
(Parkinson 
Study  Group,  2002),  PRESTO-  (Parkinson  Study 
Group,  2005),  LARGO-  (Rascol  et  al.,  2005)  and 
ADAGIO-study  (Olanow  et  al.,  2008;  2009).
    In  the  recommended  therapeutic  dosis  of  1  mg/ 
day  rasagiline  does  not  potentiate  the  tyramine 
induced  cheese-effect  (de  Marcaida  et  al.,  2006). 
This  is  in  agreement  with  earlier  findings  in  rats  and 
cats  (Finberg  et  al.,  1981;  Chen  and  Swope,  2005; 
Finberg  et  al.,  2006).

this  combination.  Severe,  sometimes 

    Coadministration  of  SSRIs  and  other  serotoni-
nergic  substances  to  tranylcypromine  is  contraindi-
cated  due  to  the  risk  of  serotonin  syndrome.  With 
moclobemide  great  caution  should  be  exercised 
with 
fatal, 
interactions  between  nonselective,  irreversible  MAOIs, 
moclobemide  as  well  as  selegiline  and  pethidine 
and  dextromethorphan  have  been  reported.  Indirectly 
acting  sympathomimetics 
(tyramine,  ephedrine, 
pseudoephedrine)  should  be  administered  with 
caution  in  patients  treated  with  MAOIs  (Dingemanse, 
1993).
    The  elimination  of  moclobemide  is  significantly 
reduced  by  cimetidine  making  dose  adjustment 
necessary.
    Although  selegiline  has  been  reported  to  have 
antidepressant  actions  when  combined  with  5-hydroxy-
tryptophan  (Mendlewicz  and  Youdim,  1978)  MAO-B- 
inhibitors  may  not  be  safe  enough  to  avoid  the 
“serotonin-syndrome”  when  given 
to 
serotonin-reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  to  treat  depre-
ssion  and  anxiety  in  PD  patients.  However,  there  is 
a 
the  “serotonin- 
syndrome”  in  selegiline  treated  patients  (Richard  et 
al.,  1997).  Also  the  results  of  a  small  number  of  PD 
patients 
tricyclics  and  SSRIs  plus 
rasagiline  in  the  TEMPO-,  PRESTO-  and  LARGO- 
studies  do  not  give  evidence  for  the  “serotonin- 
syndrome”,  the  population  incidence  of  serotonin 
toxicity  in  those  patients  has  a  9,  5%  probability  of 
being  less  than  1,  2%  (Pannisset  et  al.,  2007; 
Montgomery  and  Panisset,  2009).  However,  a 
clinical  trial  with  a  biostatistic  power  relevant  to  give 
a  definite  answer 
is  missing. 
Therefore  MAO-B  inhibitors  have  not  to  be  com-
bined  with  drugs  stimulating 
the  serotoninergic 
system.
    Meperidin  plus  selegiline  has  been  reported  to  be 
dangerous  as 
it  causes  severe  hypertension 
(Zornberg  et  al.,  1991).
    Selegiline  transdermal  without  tyramine  restriction 
revealed  no  acute  hypertensive  reactions  in  trials, 
until  more  data  are  available,  foods  that  are  rich 
sources  of  tyramine  should  be  avoided,  however. 
    As  described  by  Chen  and  Swope

while  CYP1A2  inducers  like  omeprazol  decrease  it, 
as  it  may  decrease  in  heavy  smokers.
    Minor  time-dependent  mechanism-based  inhibition 
of  CYP2D6  has  been  described  for  selegiline  and 
moclobemid  in  experimental  designs;  the  significance 
in  human  beings  remains  to  be  investigated  (Polasek 
et  al.,  2006).  For  selegiline  interactions  with  CYP 
3A4  and  CYP  2E1  may  be  relevant  too.

Expert  commentary

    While  selective  MAO-B-inhibitors  demonstrate  a 
significant  benefit  in  PD  and  improve  motoricity  and 
motor  fluctuations  eventually  causing  disease-modi-
fication  in  general  MAOIs  to  date  play  a  subor-
dinate  therapeutic  role  in  the  treatment  of  depre-
ssion  in  PD  compared  to  SSRIs  or  reboxetine,  a 
selective  noradrenergic  reuptake  inhibitor.  This  attitude 
is  primarily  due  to  the  risk  of  adverse  effects  and 
compliance  problems  (e.g.  dietary  restrictions,  inter-
action  problems)  with  MAOIs.  Moclobemide  according 
to  its  favourable  adverse  effect,  interaction  and 
toxicity  profile  can  be  used  in  depressed  Parkinson 
patients  when  activating  properties  are  necessary, 
especially. 
    Overall,  the  clinical  use  of  MAOIs  may  be  limited 
by  the  possible  adverse  effects  of  restlessness  and 
insomnia  -  but  see  rasagiline.  As  far  as  long  term 
and  prophylactic 
the 
place  of  MAOIs  still  has  to  be  verified  as  anti-
depressant  or  antidementive  drugs  in  PD  (Tariot  et 
al.,  1987;  Sano  et  al.,  1997;  Filip  and  Kolibas, 
1999;  Sterling  et  al.,  2002;  Elmer  et  al.,  2006;

    It  would  be  worthwile  to  perform  clinical  studies 
to  demonstrate  the  capacity  of  MAO-B  inhibitors  as 
antidepressants  and  antidementive  drugs.  New 
substances  like  ladostigil  (MAOA/B  inhibitor;  AchE- 
inhibitor)  or  M30  and  HLA-20  (MAO-A/B  inhibitor, 
iron-chelator)  and  M30P  (MAO-A/B  inhibitor,  carbonate 
cholinesterase  inhibitor)  give  future  aspects  of  using 
MAO-I’s  in  a  variety  of  clinical  indications  (Weinreb 
et  al.,  2010).  The  pharmacological  properties  of 
aminoindan  have  to  be  elucidated  as  they  may  be 
neuroprotective  (Bar-Am  et  al.,  2010).

be  made  between  the  neuroprotective/neurorestaurative 
properties  of  selegiline  and  rasagiline.
    Aminoindan  has  to  be  tested  in  vivo  in  order  to 
get  insight  into  its  anti-parkinsonian  efficacy.
    The  many  molecular  biological  and  -genetic  data 
evolved  from  in-vitro  studies  have  to  be  confirmed 
in  in-vivo  experiments  to  prove  relevance  in  human 
beings.  That  other  MAO-Is,  even  reversible  ones 
might  well  be  important  in  neuroprotection/disease 
modification  is  a  just  ongoing  important  issue.  In 
addition,  the  respective  role  of  MAO-A  has  to  be 
elucidated  in  more  detail.
