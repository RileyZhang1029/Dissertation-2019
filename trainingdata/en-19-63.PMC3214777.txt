ABSTRACT

Tetrahydropapaveroline  (THP),  a  neurotoxic  tetrahydroisoquinoline  alkaloid  formed  by 
condensation  between  dopamine  and  dopaldehyde,  has  been  speculated  to  cause 
Parkinson’s  disease  and  also  to  contribute  to  alcohol  dependence.  Having  two  catechol 
moieties,  THP  may  readily  undergo  oxidation  to  form  an  o-quinone  intermediate  with 
concomitant  production  of  reactive  oxygen  species,  which  can  cause  neuronal  cell 
death  and  DNA  damage.  This  review  will  deal  with  the  current  knowledge  of  neurotoxic 
effects  of  this  endogenous  alkaloid  and  underlying  biochemical  mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

    Tetrahydroisoquinolines  (THIQs),  which  belong  to  a 
group  of  cyclized  condensation  adducts  of  biogenic 
amines  with  aldehydes,  are  referred  to  as  mam-
malian  alkaloids  (Collins  et  al.,  1979).  They  include 
salsolinol  (1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-
isoquinoline;  SAL)  and  tetrahydropapaveroline  (6,7- 
dihydroxy-1-(3',4'-dihydroxybenzyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroi
soquinoline;  THP)  that  are  derived  from  dopamine 
through  condensation  with  acetaldehyde  and  do-
paldehyde  (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde),  respec-
tively  (Sandler  et  al.,  1973).  THP  is  a  putative 
dopaminergic  neurotoxin  that  is  implicated  in  the 
pathology  of  Parkinson's  disease  (McNaught  et  al., 
1998;  Collins  2004;  Soto-Otero  et  al.,  2006).  It  is 
known  that  THP  is  detected  at  a  high  level  in  the

1973;  Cashaw,  1993)  of  parkinsonian  patients  un-
der  3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine  (L-DOPA)  therapy. 
In  addition,  significant  levels  of  THP  have  also  been 
detected  in  the  brain  after  ethanol  uptake  (Cashaw, 
1993)  and/or  L-DOPA 
treatment  (Turner  et  al., 
1974;  Cashaw  et  al.,  1987;  Cashaw,  1993),  and 
this  endogenous  alkaloid  is  considered  to  account 
for 
the  neurobehavioral  abnormalities  associated 
with  alcoholism  and  may  act  as  a  neurotransmitter 
(Sango  et  al.,  2000).  In  this  review,  we  will  focus 
on  the  neurochemical/neuropharmacological  proper-
ties  of  THP  and  related  THIQs  with  regards  to  their 
possible

neuronal  disorders  including  Parkinsonism  and  al-

disease  involve  bradykinesia,  resting  tremor,  and 
muscular  rigidity.  The  most  prominent  neuropatho-
logy  in  PD  is  the  progressive  loss  of  dopamine 
neurons 
the  substantia  nigra  pars  compacta 
(SNc).  Dopaminergic  neurons  in  the  SNc  project  to 
the  dorsolateral  striatum  and  upon  stimuli,  they 
release  an  important  neurotransmitter,  dopamine. 
Therefore,  the  loss  of  dopamine  neurons  of  SNc 
results  in  reduction  of  striatal  DA  level,  and  further 
results 
in  symptoms  of  Parkinson’s  disease. 
1-Methyl-4-phenyl-  1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine  (MPTP) 
is  a  well  known  exogenous  dopaminergic  neurotoxin 
and  is  converted  by  monoamine  oxidase  (MAO)  to 
the  1-  methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium  ion  (MPP＋),  that 
selectively  kills  the  nigrostriatal  dopamine  neurons 
(Collins  et  al.,  1979;  Nagatsu,  1997;  McNaught  et 
al.,  1998;  Storch  et  al.,  2002).  THIQs  and  their 
N-methylated  metabolites  may  function  in  a  manner 
similar 
  and  has  been  de-
monstrated  that  they  can  provoke  parkinsonian-like 
symptoms 
(Nagatsu  and  Yoshida, 
1988).  Since  THP  bears  two  catechol  moieties,  the 
compound  may  readily  undergo  redox  cycling  to 
produce  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  as  well  as 
toxic  quinoids  (Surh,  1999). 
the  natural  precursor  of 
    Although  L-DOPA, 
frequently 
dopamine, 
prescribed  drug  for  controlling  symptoms  of  Par-
kinson's  disease  (Marsden,  1994),  the  dopaminergic 
neurons  continue  to  die  in  parkinsonians  during  the 
L-DOPA  therapy  (Ogawa,  1994).  L-DOPA  treatment 
may  even  hasten  the  underlying  neurodegenerative 
process  (Fahn  and  Cohen,  1992)  and  also  pro-
vokes  some  side  effects  (Morris,  1978),  a  phe-
nomenon  referred  as  “L-DOPA  paradox”.  The  do-
paminergic  neurotoxicity  and  other  adverse  effects 
of  L-DOPA  may  be  due  to  the  elevated  levels  of 
THP  (Sandler  et  al.,  1973;  Matsubara  et  al.,  1992; 
Cashaw,  1993;  McNaught  et  al.,  1998;  Collins, 
2004).  Accumulation  of  dopamine  after  L-DOPA 
treatment,  increases  the  formation  of  THP  in  par-
kinsonian  patients  and  experimental  rats  (Turner  et 
al.,  1974;  Cashaw  et  al.,  1987;  Cashaw,  1993).  In 
addition, 
treatment  of  PC12  cells  with  L-DOPA 
induced  apoptosis  by  generating  ROS,  which  was 
aggravated  by  THP  cotreatment  (Lee  et  al.,  2003).
    Therefore,  parkinsonian  patients  treated  with  L- 
DOPA  for  long-term  need  to  be  monitored  for  the 

the  most  effective  and

relationship  between  plasma  concentrations  of  THP 
and  any  plausible  symptoms  of  neurotoxicity  (Kim 
et  al.,  2006).  Moreover,  it  would  also  be  worthwhile 
determining  any  differences  in  the  levels  of  THP 
among  untreated  parkinsonian  subjects,  those  on 
L-DOPA  medication  and  normal  individuals.
    Despite  lack  of  direct  evidence  supporting  the 
role 
in  Parkinson’s 
diease,  accumulating  data  from  cell  culture  and 
animal  studies  suggest  that  this  endogenous  THIQ 
may  act  as  a  dopaminergic  neurotoxin  (Nagatsu, 
1997;  McNaught  et  al.,  1998;  Collins,  2004)  and 
the  neurotoxic  potential  of  THP  is  summarized  in

ALCOHOL  DEPENDENCE  AND  THP

    THIQs  have  been  also  postulated  to  play  a  role 
in  the  pathogenesis  of  chronic  alcoholism  (Collins  et 
al.,  1979;  Nace,  1986).  Collins  proposed  that  oxi-
dative  metabolites  of  endogenous  THIQs  may  be 
responsible  for  neuronal  damage  associated  with 
chronic  alcoholism  (Collins  et  al.,  1979). 
    Possible  implications  of  THIQs  in  alcohol  depen-
dence  were  inferred  from  the  observation  that  rats 
which  normally  rejected  alcohol  would,  following 
direct  delivery  of  THP,  drink  ethyl  alcohol  in  in-
creasingly  excessive  amounts  (Myers  and  Melchior, 
1977).  When  rats  were  injected  with  THP,  the 
preference  for  alcohol  lasted  up  to  10  months 
(Duncan  and  Deitrich,  1980;  Myers  and  Privette, 
1989).  Likewise,  microinjection  of  THP  into  the 
ventral  tegmental  area  of  anesthetized  high-etha-

dopamine  may  inhibit  aldehyde  dehydrogenase  (Tu-
ran  et  al.,  1989),  thereby  blocking  the  conversion  of 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde  into  3,4-dihydroxy-
phenylacetic  acid.  The  accumulation  of  a  relatively 
high  concentration  of  3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetalde-
hyde,  together  with  the  high  levels  of  dopamine 
derived  from  L-DOPA  administration,  may  favor  the 
formation  of  THP  (Soto-Otero  et  al.,  2006). 
    It  was  postulated  that  excess  acetaldehyde,  se-
condary  to  ethanol  metabolism,  would  competitively 
inhibit  the  breakdown  of  dopaldehyde  by  aldehyde 
dehydrogenase  (Davis  et  al.,  1970).  The  resultant 
accumulation  of  dopaldehyde  would  lead  to  an 
additional  condensation  reaction  with  dopamine  to 
augment  THP  formation  (Davis  et  al.,  1970;  Nace, 
1986).  THP  was  detected  in  specific  brain  regions 

nol-preferring  (HEP)  rats  directly  altered  the  function 
of  the  mesolimbic  pathway  and  the  dopaminergic 
system.  Such  a  perturbation  could  account  for  the 
induction  of  alcohol  preference  (Myers  and  Ro-
binson,  1999). 
    Since  (S)-THP  can  serve  as  an  intermediate  in 
de  novo  synthesis  of  more  complex  alkaloids  in-
cluding  morphine  and  codeine  in  mammals  (Haber 
et  al.,  1997;  Sango  et  al.,  2000),  overproduction  of 
THP  during  alcohol  consumption  may  increase  syn-
thesis  of  morphine  and  codeine  and  this  may  be 
associated  with  alcohol  addiction  (Kirby,  1967;  Davis 
and  Walsh,  1970;  Nace,  1986).  Although  the  phy-
siologic  roles  of  endogenous  morphine  and  codeine 
are  unknown,  they  are  known  to  have  analgesic 
effect  and  to  invoke  physical  dependence  (Weitz  et 
al.,  1986;  Donnerer  et  al.,  1987).  The  complete  mor-
phine  and  codeine  biosynthetic  pathways  in  mam-
malian  species  are  still  unclear,  but  THP  has  been 
suggested  as  a  possible  precursor  as  in  the  case  of 
plants  (Davis  and  Walsh,  1970;  Matsubara  et  al., 
1992).  If  THP  is  an  intermediate  for  the  morphine 
and  codeine  biosynthesis  in  mammals,  the  levels  of 
all 
in  L-DOPA- 
treated  parkinsonian  patients  should  be  higher  than 
those  in  normal  control  subjects.  When,  Matsubara 
and  colleagues  measured 
levels  of 
morphine  and  codeine  as  well  as  THP  in  par-
kinsonian  patients  under  L-DOPA 
they 
were  found  to  be  significantly  higher  than  those  in 
healthy  non-drinker  controls 
(Matsubara  et  al., 
1992).  It  is  also  noteworthy  that  there  were  very 
low  levels  of  THP,  morphine  and  codeine  in  the 
urine  of  abstinent  alcoholics.  Thus,  these  narcotic 
substances,  endogenously  formed  from  THP  as  an 
intermediate,  might  contribute  to  alcohol  depend-
ence  (Davis  and  Walsh,  1970;  Collins,  2004).

GENERATION  OF  THP

    THP  is  considered  to  be  formed  spontaneously 
by  non-enzymatic  Pictet-Spengler  condensation  of 
dopamine  with  its  aldehyde  metabolite  (3,4-dihy-
droxyphenylacetaldehyde)  produced  by  monoamine 
oxidase  (MAO)  (Fig.  1)  (Holtz  et  al.,  1964;  Walsh  et 
al.,  1970).  In  parkinsonian  patients  receiving  L- 
DOPA  treatment,  L-DOPA  is  converted  into  do-
pamine  by  DOPA  decarboxylase  and  the  excess

tyrosine  hydroxylase  and  further  to  dopamine.  Although  the  Pic-
tet-Spengler  condensation  reaction  of  dopamine  with  its  aldehyde 
metabolite  (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde)  produced  by  mono-
amine  oxidase  (MAO)  yields  racemic  THP,  (S)-enantiomer  is  pre-
dominantly  found  in  the  brain  of  man,  suggesting  the  occurrence

of  the  rat  after  acute  ethanol  administration  (3  g/kg 
body  weight),  but  not  in 
the  same  regions  of 
untreated  animals.  Most  brain  regions  had  de-
tectable  levels  of  THP  100  minutes  after  the  ani-
mals  received  ethanol,  and  the  striatum  contained 
the  highest  concentration  of  the  alkaloid  (Cashaw, 
1993).  THP  can  be  detected  in  the  brain  of  rats  not 
only  after  acute  ethanol  administration  (Cashaw, 
1993),  but  also  when  animals  were  subjected  to 
alcohol  consumption  ad  libitum  for  a  longer  period 
(Haber  et  al.,  1997).  In  the  latter  study,  alcohol 
administration  for  18  months  induced  formation  of 
the  (S)  enantiomer  of  THP  only  in  the  striatum  of 
the  rat  brain. 
    The  stereo-chemically  specific  THP  has  also  been 
identified  in  human  brains  in  a  later  study  (Sango  et 
al.,  2000)  and  interestingly,  only  the  (S)  enantiomer 
of  THP  was  detected,  suggesting  that  this  en-
dogenous  dicatechol 
is  presumably 
synthesized  in  the  brain  by  an  enzyme-catalyzed 
reaction.  It  is  reported  that  some  edible  plants 
adopt 
the 
synthesis  of  (S)-THP  (Rueffer  et  al.,  1983),  and 
exogenous  THP  consumed  by  man  is  anticipated  to 
cross  the  blood-brain  barrier  (Cashaw  and  Geraghty, 
1991).  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  the  stereo-chemically 
specific  exogenous  or  peripheral  origin  of  THP  is 
detected  in  the  brain.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that 
dietary  sources  of  SAL  contribute  to  its  detection  in 
biological  samples  (Smythe  and  Duncan,  1985), 
and  this  may  also  be  the  case  for  THP.

NEUROTOXIC  EFFECTS  AND 

MECHANISMS

    As  mentioned  previously,  THP  has  been  spe-
culated  to  be  implicated  in  the  etiology  of  several 
human  neurological,  behavioral,  and  psychiatric  dis-
orders,  such  as  parkinsonism  and  alcohol  addiction 
(Collins  et  al.,  1979;  Collins,  2004).  In  this  part  of 
review,  we  will  address  the  possible  neurotoxic 
mechanisms  of  THP.

Inhibition  of  tyrosine  hydroxylase  and  dopa-
mine  uptake

    It  is  reported  that  THP  significantly  decreased  the 
intracellular  dopamine  content  in  PC12  cells  (Kim  et 
al.,  2006).  THP  also  reduced  the  activity  of  tyrosine 

tyrosine  hydroxylase.  Since 

hydroxylase,  the  rate-determining  enzyme  for  the 
production  of  DOPA,  and  had  an  inhibitory  effect  on 
bovine  adrenal 
the 
reduction  of  dopamine  content  by  THP  in  PC12 
cells  was  inversed  by  the  antioxidant  N-acetyl-L- 
cysteine  (NAC),  it  is  believed  that  the  reduction  of 
the  basal  dopamine  content  by  THP  is  caused  by 
oxidative  stress  (Kim  et  al.,  2006).
    When  Okada  et  al.,  examined  the  Ki  values  of 
THP  and  three  synthetic  derivatives  for  inhibition  of 
dopamine  uptake,  they  were  almost  similar  to  that 
of  MPP
.  These  results  suggest  that  THP  and  its 
derivatives  might  be  transported  through  DAT  and 
be  involved  in  Parkinson's  disease  (Okada  et  al., 
1998).

Inhibition  of  mitochondrial  respiration  and  se-
rotonin  production

induce  Parkinson's  disease.  Since 

    MPTP-like  toxins,  THIQs,  have  been  speculated 
to 
the  neu-
rodegeneration  in  MPTP-induced  parkinsonism  is 
thought  to  be  caused  by  the  inhibition  of  mito-
chondrial  respiration,  the  effects  THP  on  the  mi-
tochondrial  respiration  were  investigated  (Suzuki  et 
al.,  1990;  Morikawa  et  al.,  1996;  Nagatsu,  1997). 
THP  significantly  inhibited  the  state  3  and  4  re-
spiration  and  reduced  the  respiratory  control  ratio. 
Toxic  properties  of  THP  on  mitochondrial  respiration 
were  quite  similar  to  those  of  MPP＋,  supporting  the 
hypothesis  that  MPTP-  or  MPP
-like  substances 
may  be  responsible  for  the  dopamine  neuron  de-
generation  (Nagatsu,  1997;  McNaught  et  al.,  1998; 
Collins,  2004). 
    THP  is  also  known  to  decrease  serotonin  content 
in  a  concentration-dependent  manner  in  serotonin- 
producing  mastocytoma  cells  (Kim  et  al.,  2003). 
Furthermore,  the  activity  of  tryptophan  hydroxylase 
was  also  inhibited  when  exposed  to  THP,  sug-
gesting  that  THP  treatment  leads  to  a  decrease  in 
serotonin  content  by  inhibiting  tryptophan  hydroxy-
lase  activity  (Kim  et  al.,  2003).

MECHANISMS  UNDERLYING 

THP-INDUCED  NEUROTOXICITY

Redox  cycling  and  cytotoxicity

    The  oxidation  chemistry  of  THIQ  analogs  was 
extensively  studied  by  electrochemical  approaches. 

Catechol-bearing  THIQs  can  undergo  auto-oxidation 
or  enzymatic  oxidation  (Zhang  and  Dryhurst,  2001; 
De  Marco  et  al.,  2002)  and  subsequent  generation 
of  reactive  quinones  via  semiquinones  may  cause 
the  degeneration  of  dopaminergic  neurons  and 
other  injuries.  The  catechol-quinone  redox  cycling, 
that  is,  the  one-electron  reduction  of  quinone  to 
semiquinone,  and  the  auto-oxidation  of  semiquinone 
to  the  quinone,  is  able  to  release  large  quantities  of 
superoxide  anion  which,  in  turn,  can  spontaneously 
or  by  superoxide  dismutase  (SOD)  action  be  trans-
formed  into  hydrogen  peroxide  (H2O2).  H2O2,  via  the 
Fenton  reaction,  can  readily  be  decomposed  to  give 
rise  to  hydroxyl  radical,  which  represents  extremely 
reactive  species  with  devastating  action  on  prac-
tically  every  cell  components  and  organelles  (De 
Marco  et  al.,  2002).  Although  quinoidal  forms  of 
THIQs  are  anticipated  to  be  reactive  per  se,  they 
can  be  converted  back  to 
the  parent  catechol 
molecules,  with  concomitant  production  of  ROS  ca-
pable  of  damaging  critical  cellular  molecules,  such 
as  DNA,  RNA,  protein  and  membrane  lipid.  Ac-
cording  to  previous  studies  in  our  laboratory,  redox 
cycling  of  SAL  (Jung  and  Surh,  2001;  Kim  et  al., 
2001)  and  THP  (Soh  et  al.,  2003;  Shin  et  al.,  2004) 
was  facilitated  in  the  presence  of  certain  transition 
metal  ions  such  as  Cu2＋
  leading  to  ROS  over-
production  and  subsequently  oxidative  cell  death 
and  DNA  damage.  Therefore,  ROS  overproduction 
is  likely  to  contribute  to  the  mechanisms  underlying 
deleterious  effects  of  THP  and  other  THIQs  (Mc-
Naught  et  al.,  1998;  Soto-Otero  et  al.,  2006).  The 
presence  of  ascorbate  enhances  this  process  by 
establishing  a  redox  cycle,  which  regenerates  THP 
from  its  quinoidal  form.  Ascorbate-promoted  THP 
auto-oxidation  caused  an

carbonyl  content,  which  was  increased  when  the

(McNaught  et  al.,  1998). 
    Dopamine-derived  catechol-bearing  THIQs  are 
neurotoxic  to  some  extent  and  might  be  implicated 
in  the  pathogenesis  of  Parkinson's  disease.  THP 
predominantly  caused  necrosis  whereas  papavero-
line  and  N-methyl-papaveroline  induced  apoptosis  in 
SH-SY5Y  cells  when  evidenced  by  typical  features 
of  condensed  and  fragmented  nuclei  (Maruyama  et 
al.,  2000).  The  cell  death  type  appeared  to  depend 
on  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP)  level,  since  THP

the  effect  of  SAL  and  THP  on  the  viability  of 
melanoma  cell  lines  was  investigated,  THP  ap-
peared  to  be  more  cytotoxic  than  SAL  and  DOPA 
(De  Marco  et  al.,  2002).  THP-induced  cytotoxicity 
was  partially  protected  by  exogenous  catalase  and 
SOD,  and  completely  abolished  by  reduced  glu-
tathione  (GSH)  and  NAC,  suggesting  that  THP 
toxicity  was  likely  due  to  increased  oxidative  stress 
(De  Marco  et  al.,  2002;  Shin  et  al.,  2004).  Inter-

which  also  supports  the  involvement  of  ROS  in 
THP  induced  cytotoxicity  (Kobayashi  et  al.,  2006). 
In  addition,  THP  exerted  toxicity  toward  the  mito-
chondrial  respiratory  chain  (Suzuki  et  al.,  1990; 
Morikawa  et  al.,  1996).  Mitochondrial  metabolism  in 
terms  of α-ketoglutarate  dehydrogenase  activity 
was  inhibited  in  murine  and  human  melanoma  cells 
and  human  epithelial  keratinocytes  in  the  presence 
of  THP  (De  Marco  et  al.,  2002;  Foppoli  et  al., 
2005). 
    The  effects  of  THP  and  SAL  on  human  primary 
melanocytes  were  re-evaluated  by  treating  the  cells 
with  variable  concentrations  of  each  THIQ  (Perluigi 
et  al.,  2003).  When  the  cytotoxicity  was  compared, 
THP  became  overtly  toxic  in  lower  concentrations 
while  SAL  showed  no  cytotoxic  effect  up  to  100μ
M.  In  contrast  to  SAL,  THP  strongly  caused  dra-
matic  decrease  of  α-ketoglutarate  dehydrogenase 
activity  (Perluigi  et  al.,  2003).

    THP-induced  cytotoxicity  appeared 
diated  by  c-Jun-terminal  kinase  and  p38  mitogen- 
activated  protein  kinase  (MAPK),  as  evidenced  by 
results  that  pretreatment  with  inhibitors  of  these 
kinases  rescued  the  glioma  cells  from  THP-induced 
cytotoxicity.  THP-treated  PC12  cells  exhibited  in-
creased 
intracellular  accumulation  of  ROS  and 
underwent  apoptosis  as  determined  by  poly(ADP- 
ribose)  polymerase  cleavage,  an  increased  ratio  of 
Bax 
transferase-me-
diated  dUTP  nick  end  labeling  (TUNEL),  and  nu-
clear  fragmentation/condensation  (Shin  et  al.,  2004). 
Furthermore,  exposure  of  PC12  cells  to  THP  com-
bined  with  L-DOPA  elicited  synergistic  effects,  in-
creasing  the  proportion  of  TUNEL-positive  apoptotic

cells.
    Taking  all  the  aforementioned  findings  together,  it 
is  evident  that  THP  provokes  cytotoxicity  in  many 
different  cell  lines  through  induction  of  oxidative 
stress.  However,  the  molecular  milieu  mediating 
THP-induced  oxidative  cell  death  needs  to  be  un-
covered.

DNA  damage

ion,  THP  caused 
    In 
phiX174  supercoiled  DNA  or  calf 
thymus  DNA 
damage  determined  by  strand  scission  or  formation 
of  8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine.  The  DNA 
damage  in  the  presence  of  THP  and  copper  was 
ameliorated  by  some  ROS  scavengers/antioxidants 
and  catalase  (Soh  et  al.,  2003). 
    In  the  presence  of  Fe(III)EDTA,  THP  caused 
DNA  damage  at  every  nucleotide  whereas  in  the 
presence  of  Cu(II),  THP  caused  the  damage  at  T 
and  G  of  5'-TG-3'  sequence  (Kobayashi  et  al., 
2006).  The  DNA  damage  was  attenuated  by  ca-
talase  and  the  metal  chelators  (Kobayashi  et  al., 
2006).  Table  2  highlights  the  biochemical  basis  of 
THP-induced  neurotoxicity.

CELLULAR  PROTECTIVE  RESPONSE 

AGAINST  THP-INDUCED  INJURIES

    As  THP  has  two  catechol  moieties,  it  undergoes 
auto-oxidation  or  enzymatic  oxidation  to  produce 
ROS,  which  may  contribute  to  the  THP-induced 
cytotoxicity.  Although  overproduction  of  ROS  is 
cytotoxic, 
initial  accumulation  of  moderate 
amounts  of  ROS  may  provoke  defense  responses 
of  cells.  The  body's  antioxidant  defense  system 
serves 
from  excess  ROS 
production  and  is  comprised  of  both  endogenous

and  exogenous  entities  (Fisher-Wellman  and  Bloo-
mer,  2009).  The  endogenous  antioxidant  defense 
include  radical  scavengers  (e.g.,  GSH,  thioredoxin, 
bilirubin,  uric  acid,  etc.),  and  antioxidant  enzymes, 
such  as  SOD,  catalase,  glutathione  peroxidase, 
glutathione  S-transferase,  glutamate-cysteine  ligase, 
NAD(P)H:quinone  oxidoreductase  1,  etc.  The  ex-
ogenous  antioxidants  (e.g.,  carotenoids,  tocophe-
rols,  ascorbate,  bioflavonoids,  etc.)  are  provided  as 
diet,  especially  fruits  and  vegetables. 
    Keratinocytes  of  the  human  epidermis,  a  tissue 
particularly  exposed  to  oxidant  stimuli,  possess  a 
wide  range  of  antioxidant  and  detoxifying  mechan-
isms  aimed  to  avoid  oxidative  damage  of  the  tissue. 
It 
that  THP  and  L-DOPA  up-
regulated  expression  of  intracellular  antioxidant  en-
zymes  to  a  different  extent  in  normal  keratinocytes 
of  human  epidermal  origin  when  compared 
to 
transformed  ones  (Foppoli  et  al.,  2005).  Normal 
diploid  keratinocytes  adequately  scavenge 
toxic 
substances  through  the  coordinated  activation  of 
several  concurrent  antioxidant  pathways.  Conver-
sely,  in  transformed  cells,  the  whole  oxidative  bur-
den  must  be  neutralized  by  the  limited  set  of 
conserved  pathways  that,  accordingly,  has  to  be 
highly  activated  (Foppoli  et  al.,  2005). 
    THP  treatment  activated  the  redox-sensitive  nu-
clear  factor  κB  (NF-κB).  Preincubation  of  PC12 
cells  with  NF-κB  inhibitors,  such  as  L-1-tosyla-
mido-2-phenylethyl  chloromethyl  ketone  and  parthe-
nolide,  aggravated  THP-induced  cytotoxicity  (Shin  et 
al.,  2004).  In  addition,  THP  treatment  altered  sur-
vival  or  death  signals  including  not  only  MAPK  but 
also  Akt/protein  kinase  B.
    The  redox-sensitive  transcription  factor  Nrf2  is 
known  to  regulate  expression  of  detoxifying  and 
antioxidant  enzymes  and  other  defensive  proteins 
against  oxidative  stress  and  other  noxious  con-
ditions  (Motohashi  and  Yamamoto,  2004).  THP 
treatment  elevated  nuclear  translocation  of  Nrf2 
and  its  subsequent  binding  to  antioxidant  response 
element.  An  important  enzyme  that  plays  an  es-
sential  role  in  cellular  survival  response  to  a  wide 
is  heme  oxygenase-1  (HO-1).

Treatment  of  PC12  cells  with  THP 
increased 
expression  of  HO-1,  and  THP-induced  cytotoxicity

2007).  When  PC12  cells  were  transfected  with 
dominant-negative  Nrf2  after  THP  treatment,  the 
cytotoxicity  was  increased  and  HO-1  expression 
was  decreased.  These  results  suggest  that  cells  try 
to  protect  themselves  from  THP-mediated  cell  death 
by  activating  Nrf2  and  inducing  antioxidant/cytopro-
tective  enzymes,  particularly  HO-1. 

CONCLUDING  REMARKS

    Over  the  past  three  decades,  THP  and  other 
structurally 
related  THIQ  alkaloids  have  been 
studied  for  neurotoxic  potential  in  parkinsonism  and 
alcoholism.  Additional  studies  are  necessary 
to 
uncover  the  molecular  targets  of  this  neurotoxin, 
especially 
in  cell  death  or  cell 
defense  intracellular  signaling  cascades.  In  addition, 
the  adverse  effects  of  THP  on  cellular  functions 
other  than  neurotoxic  activity  merit  further  inve-
stigation.
