Iron- and methane-cycling are important processes in wetlands with one connected to
plant growth and the other to greenhouse gas emission, respectively. In contrast to acidic
habitats, there is scarce information on the ecology of microbes oxidizing ferrous iron
at circumneutral pH. The latter is mainly due to the lack of isolated representatives and
molecular detection techniques. Recently, we developed PCR–DGGE and qPCR assays
to detect and enumerate Gallionella-related neutrophilic iron-oxidizers (Ga-FeOB) enabling
the assessment of controlling physical as well as biological factors in various ecosystems.
In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of Ga-FeOB in co-occurrence with
methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) in a riparian wetland. Soil samples were collected at
different spatial scales (ranging from meters to centimeters) representing a hydrological
gradient. The diversity of Ga-FeOB was assessed using PCR–DGGE and the abundance of
both Ga-FeOB and MOB by qPCR. Geostatistical methods were applied to visualize the
spatial distribution of both groups. Spatial distribution as well as abundance of Ga-FeOB and
MOB was clearly correlated to the hydrological gradient as expressed in moisture content
of the soil. Ga-FeOB outnumbered the MOB subgroups suggesting their competitiveness
or the prevalence of Fe2+ over CH4 oxidation in this ﬂoodplain.

INTRODUCTION
Wetland ecosystems are sites of intense biogeochemical cycling
due to the interactions between the oxic surface and deeper anoxic
soil layers making them highly productive ecosystems (Weiss et al.,
2003; Gutknecht et al., 2006; Hartman et al., 2008; Burgin et al.,
2011). Apart from being a crucial habitat for many animals, plants,
and humans, wetlands are also the largest biological source of
the greenhouse gas methane (Ringeval et al., 2011). Cycling of
nutrients and emission of methane from wetlands is strongly
intertwined due to the oxic–anoxic conditions in close proximity
(Kogel-Knabner et al., 2010; Burgin et al., 2011) which is especially
distinct for iron and methane (Laanbroek, 2010).

Oxic–anoxic interfaces in wetland soils are signiﬁcantly
extended by roots of wetland plants which are known to release
oxygen from their roots, a phenomenon called “radial oxygen loss”
(ROL; Armstrong, 1964; Bodelier et al., 2006; Laanbroek, 2010).
Next to this, oxygen is also introduced into anoxic soils by other
physical or biological processes (Doyle and Otte, 1997; Coci et al.,
2005; Mermillod-Blondin and Lemoine, 2010) resulting in sharp
redox gradients characteristic of wetland soils and sediments.

As one of the most important elements in biogeochemical redox
reactions (Fortin and Langley, 2005), iron interacts with other

) to ferrous iron (Fe2+

elemental cycles, which in turn affect the growth and activities of
plants and microorganisms. Iron oxides are widely distributed in
wetland environments and will be reduced rapidly under anoxic
conditions by anaerobic iron(III)-reducing bacteria, that couple
the oxidation of organic carbon compounds to the reduction of
iron (Fe3+
; Lovley, 1997; Burgin et al., 2011).
Ferrous iron can be oxidized chemically, however, in freshwater
wetlands microbial activity accounts for a large part of the pro-
duction of iron oxides under circumneutral pH conditions, despite
the fact that chemical oxidation under these conditions proceeds
much faster. This contradiction triggered studies detecting iron-
oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) associated with iron oxides in samples
from circumneutral environments (Emerson and Moyer, 1997;
Weiss et al., 2003; Chan et al., 2009). Actual bacterial mediation of
iron oxidation was also conﬁrmed, further pointing to the impor-
tant role of FeOB in the formation of iron oxides (Neubauer et al.,
2002).

Despite the fact that a number of FeOB have been isolated and
our understanding of the role of these microorganisms in iron
oxidation has signiﬁcantly progressed (Emerson et al., 2010) vir-
tually nothing is known about the environmental factors affecting
the diversity and distribution of FeOB in their natural habitats.

Spatial patterns of iron and methane oxidizers

Sundby et al. (2003) have proposed that seasonal changes of O2
concentration and pore water Fe2+
availability resulting from the
growth and death of roots exert a major control on the precipi-
tation of iron oxides. Neubauer et al. (2007) reported signiﬁcant
temporal changes in the iron-oxidizing community in microcosm
studies with plants, which suggests that plant biomass and activ-
ity play a key role in rhizospheric Fe(II) oxidation. Changes in
the Gallionella-related FeOB community composition have been
observed to depend on season and hydrology in a tidal freshwater
marsh (Wang et al., 2011), probably connected to the effects these
parameter have on oxygen availability.

Next to chemical oxidation, there are quite a few biotic processes
that consume oxygen, such as the oxidation of ammonium,
methane, and sulﬁde, which are all products of anaerobic micro-
bial processes. Thermodynamically, Fe(II) oxidation yields more
energy than other chemolithotrophic reactions under oxygen-
limiting conditions (Thauer et al., 1977), suggesting that sub-oxic
conditions may be the niche occupied by FeOB in wetland soils.
However, no information is available on the spatial distribution
of niches suitable for FeOB as well as the competition for limit-
ing amounts of oxygen between iron-oxidizing bacteria and other
oxygen-consuming organisms.

A well characterized group of microbes also thriving at oxic–
anoxic boundaries are aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB),
utilizing methane for carbon as well as energy source (Semrau
et al., 2010). The aerobic MOB are represented in the phylum of the
Proteobacteria and recently also MOB have been identiﬁed within
the Verrucomicrobia (Op den Camp et al., 2009). Many environ-
mental factors controlling the ecology of MOB have been studied
and indentiﬁed (Conrad, 2007; Semrau et al., 2010; Bodelier,
2011). The proteobacterial MOB have traditionally been divided
into type I and II, based on phylogeny, physiology, and morphol-
ogy. On the basis of phylogeny, type I has been subdivided in three
subtypes Ia, Ib, and Ic (Lüke and Frenzel, 2011). The obligatory
aerobic metabolism of most MOB suggest that their environmen-
tal distribution and demands are similar to those for FeOB. For
type II and Ia MOB different ecological strategies are emerging,
type II being slow responders to substrate availability but persistent
in the environment, whereas type Ia harbors species that respond
and grow fast upon substrate availability (Steenbergh et al., 2010;
Bodelier et al., 2012). Considering this, the vast ecological knowl-
edge available about various environmental as well as isolated
subtypes of MOB may be extrapolated to possible co-occurring
FeOB. Besides using microbial co-occurrence, the distribution of
FeOB according to spatial gradients of controlling environmen-
tal conditions is another way of obtaining ecological information.
Since the soil is a highly heterogeneous environment, soil compo-
nents, and properties may exhibit high spatial variations (Franklin
and Mills, 2003; Baker et al., 2009; Ferreira et al., 2010). In particu-
lar, the perceived microbial community structure may depend on
the spatial scale of observation, in the range of centimeters to a few
hundred meters (Ettema and Wardle, 2002; Philippot et al., 2009b).
Sampling of microbial communities in a spatial design followed
by geostatistical analyses has rendered important ecological infor-
mation on the functioning and distribution of ammonia oxidizers
(Wessen et al., 2011), denitriﬁers (Philippot et al., 2009b), methane
oxidizers (Siljanen et al., 2011) as well as total microbial commu-
nities (Philippot et al., 2009a) by estimating the distribution in

unsampled areas of experimental plots. However so far nothing
is known about the spatial distribution of iron-oxidizing bacterial
communities.

The aim of this paper is to assess the spatial distribution of the
Gallionella-related FeOB (Ga-FeOB) and MOB communities and
their interactions in an irregularly ﬂooded riparian wetland. Col-
lecting samples at different spatial scales representing a hydrolog-
ical gradient allowed investigating the effect of ﬂooding intensity.
Special attention is paid to the inﬂuence of sampling scale and ele-
vation on the distribution of both Ga-FeOB and MOB. Commu-
nity structure of Ga-FeOB were measured by a previously designed
nested PCR–DGGE and abundances of both Ga-FeOB and MOB
by qPCR. Community was linked to environmental variables. Spa-
tial distribution of bacterial groups was visualized by interpolated
spatial maps. We hypothesized that the community structure of
iron-oxidizing bacteria changes with sampling scale and elevation,
having an effect on the presence of MOB or vice versa.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SITE AND SAMPLING
N,
Soil samples were collected from the Ewijkse Waard (51˚88
5˚73
E), a riparian ﬂoodplain along the River Waal (i.e., a tributary
of the River Rhine) in the Netherlands, in November 2006. The soil
properties have been described previously in detail (Kemnitz et al.,
2004; Steenbergh et al., 2010; Bodelier et al., 2012). The sampling
site is located on the embankment of a small oxbow lake which is
connected to the river on one side but is separated from the river by
an outﬂow barrier, ensuring that the oxbow lake does not become
dry completely. This outﬂow barrier results in slow retreat of water
from the sampling plot after ﬂooding, which results in series of dif-
ferent ﬂooding days within the plot; the highest part being ﬂooded
up to 2 weeks per year, while the lowest part can be ﬂooded up to
150 days per year (Bodelier et al., 2012). To assess spatial depen-
dence and heterogeneity a nested design was used as described by
Franklin and Mills (2003). In total 73 soil cores (1.8 cm× 5 cm)
were collected in a 10 m× 10 m plot (Figure 1A). The large-scale
spatial level of sampling comprised 24 cores arranged evenly dis-
tributed along the sides and diagonals of the plot as depicted in
Figure 1A. Nested around the intersection of the diagonals of
the large plot, 23 samples were taken using the same distribu-
tion but now on a 1 m× 1 m grid (medium scale; Figure 1B).
Nested around the same diagonal again 24 samples were obtained
in a 20 cm× 20 cm grid (small scale; Figure 1C). The 10 m× 10 m
plot was situated on a slope on the embankment of the oxbow lake
resulting in an elevation difference of 1.1 m between the lowest and
highest point of the plot. The samples taken at the three spatial
scales were classiﬁed according to their elevation in the following
elevation level classes, low (0–0.33 m), intermediate (0.34–0.66 m),
and high (0.67–1.1 m). Soil water content (based on dry weight),
soil density, total soil organic matter, and water ﬁlled pore space
were analyzed using standard methods.

DNA EXTRACTION
DNA was extracted using a modiﬁcation of the method described
Yeates and Gillings (1998), based on the FastDNA spin kit for soil
(MP Biomedicals, LLC, Solon, OH, USA), as described earlier (Pan
et al., 2010). Soil (0.3 g) and 780 μl lysis buffer [200 mM NaPO4

added into a multimix FastPrep tube and incubated at 37˚C for
30 min. MT buffer (122 μl), provided with the kit, was added and
tubes were shaken in the FastPrep instrument (MP, Biomedicals,
−1. Subsequently, samples
LLC, Solon, OH, USA) for 30 s at 5.5 m s
were centrifuged for 15 min at 10000 rpm and 700 μl supernatant
was collected. The pellet was re-extracted by adding lysis buffer
(500 μl) and 50 μl MT buffer to the FastPrep tubes, shaken in the
−1 again followed by the
FastPrep instrument for 30 s at 5.5 m s
transfer of the second 700 μl of supernatant into separate Eppen-
dorf tubes. At this step, 2 μl× 700 μl supernatant was obtained
−1 freshly made
from each sample. Five microliters of 10 mg ml
proteinase K was added to each tube. Tubes were incubated at 65˚C
for 30 min. Samples were extracted with phenol–chloroform–
isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), followed by a chloroform–isoamyl alco-
hol (24:1) extraction. One hundred twenty-ﬁve microliters of
7.5 M potassium acetate was added, samples were incubated on ice
for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min. Super-
natants (2× 700 μl per soil sample) were transferred to new tubes,
700 μl Binding Matrix was added, and tubes were mixed for 5 min
on a rotator. Binding Matrix, with bound DNA, was pelleted by
1 min centrifugation at 10000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded
and pellet was resuspended in 500 μl wash buffer. The resulting
suspension was added into a Spin ﬁlter, and centrifuged for 1 min
at 10000 rpm. The eluent was discarded and the pellet was washed
again in 500 μl wash buffer. After discarding the second eluent,
the Spinﬁlter was centrifuged for another 10 s to dry the pellet.
The ﬁlter was taken into a new tube and 50 μl of TE pH 8.0 was
added. The ﬁlter was incubated at room temperature for 1 min
and centrifuged for 1 min. The ﬁlter was re-eluted in the same way
with 50 μl of TE pH 8.0. The eluent collected in the catch tube
contained the puriﬁed DNA. A total of 18 out of 73 samples (i.e.,
L1–5, M25, M31, M 46, M 49, S50, S52, S53, S56, S60, S63, S65,
S67, and S72) did not give products during PCR procedures and
were excluded from further analysis.

PCR–DGGE
A nested PCR–DGGE targeting Ga-FeOB was performed using
a previously developed assay (Wang et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, 1 μl of
−1 puriﬁed environmental DNA was used for the ﬁrst step
50 ng μl
PCR with primer set 122F–998R. The PCR was run in a 50-μl reac-
tion volume containing 5 μM of each primer, 2.5 mM of dNTPs,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM BSA, and 1.25 units Taq DNA polymerase.
The PCR conditions included 1 cycle of 5 min at 94˚C, followed
by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94˚C, 1 min at 55˚C, and 1.5 min at 72˚C,
the ﬁnal extension cycle was 10 min at 72˚C. The PCR products
were diluted 10 times and 2 μl of the dilution was used for a
second-step PCR using universal primers set GC-F357 and 907R
following a touch-down PCR cycle (Schäfer et al., 2001). Clones
generated in a previous study (Wang et al., 2009), representing
different phylogenetic taxa, were re-ampliﬁed using general bac-
terial DGGE primers GC-F357 and R907 (Muyzer et al., 1993),
and used as markers. DGGE was performed with the Bio-Rad
Protean II system as described previously (Muyzer et al., 1993).
An 8% polyacrylamide gel with a vertical gradient of 30–60%
of the denaturant was used to analyze the 550 bp PCR products.

Spatial patterns of iron and methane oxidizers

Equal volumes of the PCR products obtained after the second
PCR reaction were loaded. The running conditions was 100 V
at a constant temperature of 60˚C in 23 L of 0.5× TAE buffer
(20 mM Tris acetate, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 18 h. The DGGE
gels were visualized using an UV transilluminator after ethidium
bromide-staining. The representative bands were excised, puri-
ﬁed, and sequenced. The sequences were checked and manually
modiﬁed using Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corporation,
City, USA) and aligned in the ARB program (Ludwig et al., 2004).
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor Join-
ing method. Sequences were deposited with GenBank under the
following accession numbers JQ060106–JQ060114, representing
DGGE bands G14–G37, respectively.

REAL-TIME PCR
A recently developed real-time PCR assay (Wang et al., 2011)
was used to quantify the Ga-FeOB bacteria in the samples col-
lected. The primer set includes a degenerate forward primer
628F (GBMAGGCTAGAGTGTAGC) and a reverse primer 998R
(CTCTGGAAACTTCCTGAC). DNA from soil samples was puri-
−1. The
ﬁed and diluted accurately to a concentration of 10 ng μl
real-time PCR was performed in a 25-μl reaction volume contain-
ing 2.5 μl puriﬁed DNA and 22.5 μl SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix
−1.
(Invitrogen). The concentration of each primer was 5 pmol μl
The PCR involved 45 cycles, with each cycle consisting of denatu-
ration at 95˚C for 20 s, annealing at 56˚C for 20 s, and extension at
72˚C for 45 s. Data acquisition was done at 82˚C for 10 s, to avoid
signal from primer dimer formation. The DNA copy number of
Ga-FeOB in each sample was estimated by comparing the Ct value
of each sample to those of the standard regression line, which was
made by using reference clones (Wang et al., 2009, 2011). Three
methanotrophic subgroups were quantiﬁed by pmoA-based quan-
titative PCR based on the assays described by Kolb et al. (2003). The
type Ia, Ib, and II assays were carried out as previously described
(Pan et al., 2010) with 25 μl reaction containing 12.5 μl 2× SYBR
green mix (AB gene, Epsom, UK), 2.5 μl of diluted DNA template
and 0.8 mM each of primers. The samples were diluted accurately
−1. The thermal cycle started with an initial denatura-
to 1 ng μl
tion at 95˚C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at
95˚C for 20 s, annealing at 64˚C for 20 s, and extension at 72˚C for
45 s. Fluorescence was recorded at 84˚C and DNA melting curve
analysis was performed at temperatures ranging from 70 to 99˚C.
All assays (Ga-FeOB and MOB) were performed with a Rotor-
Gene 6000 thermal cycling system (Corbett Research, Eight Mile
Plains, QLD, Australia), where samples were added to aliquots of
the master mixture using a CAS-1200 (Corbett Robotics Eight Mile
Plains, QLD, Australia) liquid handling system. Every sample was
performed in duplicate. Quantiﬁcation analysis was performed by
the Rotor-Gene software. A number of samples failed to reach the
detection limit of the assays: Ga-FeOB (M25, M27, M31, M37,
M48, S49–S59, S63, S64, S65, S67). Type Ia MOB (L2, S50, S52,
S54–S59, S60, S61, S64, S65). Type Ib MOB (S52). Type II MOB
(M45).

DATA ANALYSIS
DGGE gels were analyzed using Phoretix gel analysis software
(Phoretix International, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The number

of bands of each lane was deﬁned and a matrix of band intensity
was created. Lanes were created manually, with a ﬁxed width of 5%
of the standard lane width. Each lane represents one sample. Back-
ground noise was subtracted by using the Rolling Ball algorithm
with a radius of 50 pixels. Bands were detected automatically with
a minimum slope of 100 and a noise reduction of 4. Then bands
were assessed and corrected by eye, matched to a reference lane
(Markers), and quantiﬁed. The relative abundance of each band
was deﬁned as the intensity ratio of each band to the total intensity
of individual lanes.

Similarity between DGGE community proﬁles was analyzed
using multivariate analyses in PRIMER 5 software (Plymouth
Marine Laboratory, Plymouth, UK). Relative abundance data
derived from the DGGE gels were used in non-metric Multidi-
mensional Scaling (MDS) analyses. The input of MDS analyses
were Bray–Curtis similarity matrices generated using log (x + 1)
transformed relative abundances data. The MDS analyses results in
a two-dimensional plot where the distance between samples indi-
cates the similarity of these samples relative to other samples in the
plot. The accuracy of the two-dimensional representation is indi-
cated by the “Stress” value (Kruskal’s stress formula). Stress values
<0.1 indicate a good ordination with no prospect of misleading
interpretation. Stress values <0.2 still give a good two-dimensional
representation where not too much reliance should be put on the
detail. Theoretical aspects of the MDS analyses used are described
by Clarke and Warwick (2001). One-way ANOSIM in PRIMER
software test was used to compare samples between different scales
(Clarke and Warwick, 1998). Data of the relative abundance of
each band was log-transformed and analyzed using Statistica soft-
ware package (Statistica version 9, StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, USA),
together with the qPCR results, and a number of deﬁned envi-
ronmental parameters. The distribution of bacterial abundance at
different elevation levels and sampling scales was compared using
ANOVA. Post hoc Tukey analysis was used to further compare the
difference among samples. The relation between Ga-FeOB and
MOB was done using non-parametric pair wise correlation in
Statistica.

To model the spatial structures of the total abundance of Ga-
FeOB (logarithm of the total 16s rRNA gene copy number), MOB
(logarithm of the total pmoA gene copy number), and the mois-
ture content (weight percentages) geostatistics were applied. These
methods originate from mineralogy and soil science and are a com-
mon tool to identify and model spatial patterns (Legendre and
Legendre, 1998). The basic principle is autocorrelation of spatial
variability, i.e., close-set samples are more similar than those fur-
ther apart (Ettema and Wardle, 2002). In a ﬁrst step a variogram
analysis was performed. In brief, semi-variances between sam-
ples were calculated and plotted against their spatial separation;
the slope indicated whether a spatial structure is present or not
(Ettema and Wardle, 2002). The Hawkins and Cressie’s modulus
estimator was calculated to create variograms and maximum likeli-
hood (ML) estimations with Matérn covariance function was ﬁtted
to semi-variance values (Cressie, 1993). The estimated model para-
meters have been used for kriging. This is a geostatistical method
to visualize spatial structures of properties by spatial interpolation
maps (Ribeiro and Diggle, 2001). Before kriging, goodness of ﬁt
of the model parameters has been tested by cross validation. To

Hc9 and Hc16, respectively (Figure 4) isolated from a freshwa-

related to Gallionella-related clones (Hc8) obtained from the same
wetland (Wang et al., 2009).

RESULTS
COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF GALLIONELLA-RELATED FeOB
Between one and four bands in each sample were retrieved from
the DGGE gels (Figure 2). There is a trend toward fewer bands
in the samples collected at the small scale. Taking the relative
intensities of the bands as input matrix for multivariate analyses
using multidimensional scaling showed that the Ga-FeOB com-
munity in samples taken from large and medium scales differed
from the samples collected at small scale, but not from each other
(Figure 3; ANOSIM analyses, R = 0.42, large vs small, R = 0.43
medium vs small). A total of nine bands were retrieved from
the DGGE gels and sequenced. They were distantly related to
known cultures, with uncultured clones as most close relatives
(Figure 4). The most dominant band (G35, G14, Figure 2) from
the medium-scale and large-scale samples was closely related to a
recently isolated neutrophilic Ga-FeOB strain HDD (Wang, 2011).
The most closely isolated relative to Band G37, G16, and G17
is Sideroxydans lithotrophicus strain LD-1 (Weiss et al., 2007), a
microaerophilic iron-oxidizing bacterium. Bands G33 and G34

EFFECTS OF SPATIAL SCALE AND ELEVATION LEVEL ON THE
ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF GALLIONELLA-RELATED FeOB AND

Spatial scale
The abundance of Gallionella-related FeOB as determined by copy
numbers of 16s rRNA genes, ranged from 1× 103 to 3.9× 108
per gram dry soil. Five out of 23 medium-scale samples did not
yield product in the qPCR analyses, indicating that their 16s
rRNA copy numbers were below the detection limit, and thus
were excluded from the analyses. The highest copy number was
observed in sample L20, taken in the high elevation part. The
average copy numbers of the 16s rRNA gene from samples taken
at large and medium scales, i.e., 4.6× 107 and 3.7× 107 copies per
gram dry weight, respectively, were signiﬁcantly higher than that
of the small-scale samples (5.4× 106 copies per gram dry weight;
Figure 5A).

lionella-related iron-oxidizing bacteria as well as methane oxi-
dizers across spatial scales (Table 1). Post hoc Tukey test indi-
cated that the abundance of both Ga-FeOB and MOB in samples

(x + 1) transformed relative abundance of the DGGE bands of the
samples taken at different spatial scales.

At large- and medium-sampling scales, the total gene copy
numbers of the different bacterial groups followed the sequence,
Ga-FeOB > MOB type II > type 1b > type Ia (Figure 5A). Signif-
icant differences were detected between all the groups except for
type II and type Ib MOB. In the small-scale sampling plot, the
abundance of MOB type Ia was signiﬁcantly lower than in the rest
of the samples (Figure 5A).

A diverse pattern of relative abundance of the bands retrieved
from the DGGE gels was obtained. Among all the bands detected,
band G35 and band G36 were the most abundant ones (Figure 2)
off which G35 showed a similar trend to the average abundance
detected using qPCR (Figure 6A). The relative abundance of band
G35 dropped signiﬁcantly at small-sampling scale as compared to
large- and medium-scale samples whereas G36 did not. The rest of
the bands did not show a clear trend given spatial level as a factor.

Elevation level
ANOVA analyses demonstrated that elevation signiﬁcantly
affected the numbers of FeOB and type I a MOB (Table 1). With
the increase of elevation, the abundance of FeOB increased sig-
niﬁcantly (Figure 5B). Again in this case, the relative abundance
of band G35 followed the same positive trend with increasing
elevation which was not the case for G36 (Figure 6B). MOB
showed a similar trend as the Ga-FeOB except for type Ia, which

of Ga-FeOB and MOB of all three sub-types were positively
correlated (Table 2).

Spatial interpolation maps
Interpolated maps revealed that Ga-FeOB and MOB abundances
display different spatial patterns (Figures 7B–E). While a gra-
dient was observed in Ga-FeOB and type I MOB abundances,
type II MOB did not follow a gradient. A comparison between
interpolated maps of soil moisture content and Ga-FeOB abun-
dance data indicated a negative correlation between these two
factors (Figures 7A,B). This was conﬁrmed by Spearman corre-
lation analyses using only the measured data (Table 2). Similarly,
type I MOB abundances (Figures 7A,C,D) indicated a negative
correlation with moisture content which was supported by Spear-
man correlation (Table 2). Ga-FeOB and type Ib showed also the
highest spatial dependencies (Table 3). Type Ib displayed a very
similar distribution as Ga-FeOB while type Ia abundance tends to
be highest at intermediate elevations levels of the study site. Type
II showed a distinctly deviating distribution (Figure 7E) which did
also not correlate with moisture content (Table 2). Interestingly
the lowest moisture content was observed not at the top of sam-
pling plot, but to the side of the plot with the highest plant biomass
(i.e., 0.56–1.12 m higher than the lowest point of the plot).

DISCUSSION
The present study gives insights into the spatial patterns of
microbes involved in two important geochemical processes along
a hydrological gradient. Ga-FeOB outnumber MOB but their
abundance is positively correlated to various subgroups of MOB,
indicating that there are shared controlling environmental factors.
The strong increase in numbers of iron-oxidizing bacteria with
elevation and the negative correlation with soil moisture content
indicate that the hydrological gradient is one of the important
environmental factors that control the distribution of the Ga-
FeOB. However, the distribution of Ga-FeOB in the present study
was opposite to the distribution of Ga-FeOB in a tidal freshwa-
ter marsh showing higher numbers in the regularly ﬂooded, lower
parts of the marsh compared to the higher parts (Wang et al.,
2011). The strong relationship with Fe(III) availability and Ga-
FeOB abundance in the study of Wang et al. (2011) pointed to
iron as the primary controlling factor, a fact recently also observed
in drinking water distribution systems (Li et al., 2010). Although
we did not measure iron availability at time of sampling in the
present study, an earlier study at the same site showed that total Fe
in these soils is around 5 ppm (Conrad et al., 2008). This observa-
tion combined with the orders of magnitude higher numbers of
Ga-FeOB found as compared to the tidal freshwater marsh, indi-
cates that iron availability was not limiting at the ﬂoodplain site.
As soil moisture content decreases with elevation (Figure 7A), the
availability, and penetration depth of oxygen into the soil likely
increases also, which in itself should favor bacterial iron oxida-
tion. However, when soil oxygenation increases, more ferrous iron
may be consumed by chemical iron oxidation. A decrease in soil
moisture content may also lead to less iron reduction, which conse-
quently slows down the redox turnover of iron (Blothe and Roden,
2009). Together, this would lead to low ferrous iron supply, a key
factor for iron-oxidizing activity. Apparently, the conditions also

displayed maximum abundance in the intermediate elevation level
(Figure 5B). There was a signiﬁcant difference between the abun-
dance of type Ia in samples taken from medium (33–46 cm) and
low level (0–33 cm). No difference was observed among the abun-
dance of other types of methane oxidizers along the elevation
gradient.

The total 16s rRNA gene copy numbers detected for Ga-FeOB
was much higher (10- to 100-fold) than the pmoA gene numbers
of the different types of methane oxidizers at all elevation lev-
els. The only reported 16s RNA copy numbers for iron-oxidizing
genomes reported indicate two copies per genome (Fleming et al.,
2011) while MOB generally have two to three copies of the pmoA
gene (Kolb et al., 2003) supporting the absolute dominance of Ga-
FeOB over MOB in terms of cell numbers. Overall, abundance

in the upper parts of the ﬂoodplain are such that oxygen and fer-
rous iron are both available and that Ga-FeOB can compete with
chemical oxidation.

All Ga-FeOB so far isolated are all lithotrophic obligatory aer-
obic bacteria which mainly are controlled by the availability of
+
Fe
2 and O2 (Emerson et al., 2010). The dominant Ga-FeOB in
this study (represented by band G35 and G36) display a clearly
different distribution. G35 increases with elevation related to the
lower water content and probably to the connected oxygen avail-
ability. The sequence is closely related to an isolate also derived
from an irregular ﬂooded riparian soil and tentatively called “Fer-
ricurvibacter nieuwersluisensis”(Wang, 2011) which also grew in
gradient tubes under microaerophilic conditions but also could
tolerate exposure to higher amounts of oxygen (Wang, 2011). G36
did not display an elevation-related distribution in this irregular
ﬂoodplain but is highly related to a sequence (Hc8 in Figure 2)
which was the most dominant one in a tidal marsh, where it also
correlated positively with iron availability (Wang, 2011). Although,
we have no physiological data to support any ﬁrm conclusions
regarding environmental control, it seems that within the Ga-
FeOB there is habitat preference and niche differentiation likely
+
related to the local regimes of O2 and or Fe
2 availability. Con-
sidering the limited number of isolates and lack of physiological
knowledge of these isolates, it would be too speculative to discuss
other environmental controls. However, considering the phyloge-
netic diversity in the proposed order Gallionellales (Emerson et al.,
2010; Figure 4) it can be expected that behind the sequences there
will be microbes with a broader metabolic repertoire and different
oxygen tolerances than isolated so far, offering explanations for
the environmental patterns observed in various environments.

The irregular ﬂooded riparian ﬂoodplain studied and the tidal
marsh investigated in a previous study (Wang et al., 2011) were
very similar in terms of Ga-FeOB community composition but
differed markedly in Ga-FeOB abundance Although the primers
are targeting Gallionella-related FeOB only, the range of differ-
ent sequence types or strains potentially detected by the primers

used is much higher than detected in both studies (Wang et al.,
2009) rendering it unlikely that the resemblance is due to a primer
bias. This leads to the conclusion that physico-chemical condi-
tions at the irregularly ﬂooded site are better for performance of
the dominant Ga-FeOB at that site. The alternative explanation
would be that competition with other microbes and processes is
more intense in the tidal freshwater marsh.

According to thermodynamics (Thauer et al., 1977; Sobolev and
Roden, 2002), the oxidation processes should follow the order of
ferrous iron > methane > sulﬁde > ammonium oxidation under
conditions of oxygen limitation. It has been suggested by Neubauer
et al. (2002) that neutrophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria may com-
pete for limiting amounts of O2 in the rhizosphere and therefore
inﬂuence other wetland biogeochemical cycles. van Bodegom et al.
(2001b) also reported that iron oxidation was the most important
oxidative process in a rice paddy rhizosphere and accounted ini-
tially for 97% of the consumed oxygen using a detailed mechanistic
model (van Bodegom et al., 2001a). However, in an accompanying
study these authors did not detect iron oxidizers by means of tra-
ditional cultivation-dependent most probable number counts and
concluded that this oxidation was mainly chemical and that micro-
bial iron oxidation was negligible (van Bodegom et al., 2001b).
However, in our irregularly ﬂooded site the Ga-FeOB outnumber
the various groups of MOB yielding the ﬁrst experimental evi-
dence suggesting that on microbial population level microbial iron
oxidation can prevail over methane consumption and that chemi-
cal iron oxidation may not be as dominant as assumed. We have to
bear in mind though that this conclusion is based on DNA-based
abundance assessment and not on measured processes.

The recent isolation and genomic description of a marine neu-
trophilic iron oxidizer provided evidence for the microaerophilic
nature and high afﬁnity for oxygen of FeOB, which would enable
them to be active at lower oxygen concentrations than chemi-
cal oxidation and methane oxidizers can (Singer et al., 2011).
However, there are no clues to the extent to which this infor-
mation can be extrapolated to freshwater wetlands. The recent

−1/day) to net emission (180 mg CH4 m

Alternative to the ability to compete with MOB, the dominance
of FeOB over MOB may also be caused indirectly due to sup-
pression of methanogenesis caused by substrate competition with
iron reducers. Hence, sub-optimal methane supply would restrict
the activities of MOB. The lag in methanogenic activity as mea-
sured in methane production assays on this site in an earlier study
points into that direction (Kemnitz et al., 2004). Methane ﬂux
measurements executed on the same day as sampling was done
in this study yielded values ranging from methane uptake (24 mg
−1/day; data not

shown). This highly variable emission, with negative values and
values even in the range of rice ﬁelds does not allow for conclusive
statements toward methane availability for MOB. However, earlier
studies on this site demonstrated immediate in vitro methane con-
sumption displaying rates in the range of high methane habitats
(Steenbergh et al., 2010; Bodelier et al., 2012) suggesting continu-
ous methane availability for MOB. It will require more detailed
studies, monitoring soil iron (Fe2+
) as well as methane
availability in parallel to FeOB and MOB community assessments
to obtain supporting evidence for “competitive ability” or the
“substrate limitation” hypotheses.

In contrast to the distribution based on the measured points
only, spatial interpolation maps of Ga-FeOB and MOB abun-
dances reveal that Ga-FeOB and type Ib MOB display spatial
autocorrelation which reﬂects the underlying hydrological gra-
dient (i.e., combined effects of moisture content and elevation;
Figure 7). Type Ia and II MOB displayed a distribution not
spatially correlated to the hydrological gradient, with type Ia dis-
playing highest abundances at intermediate moisture and type II
showing a patchy distribution over the entire gradient. This dif-
ferential distribution may be related to the different ecological
“strategies” described for the various types of MOB (Steenbergh
et al., 2010) with the fast-growing, responsive MOB (i.e., type Ia)
abundant where substrates are available and type II occupying
patches where survival of periods without substrate is required.
A very similar spatial distribution of type II and type Ia MOB
was found in a hydrological gradient in a littoral zone of a fresh-
water lake (Siljanen et al., 2011) supporting niche differentiation
of MOB with respect to hydrology-associated environmental fac-
tors. In the study of Siljanen et al., type Ib also displayed a strong
spatial autocorrelation with the hydrological gradient, but in con-
trast to the present study a positive relationship was found with
moisture content. This can be explained by the fact that what is
assigned as type Ib MOB contains uncultured as well as cultured
representatives with quite different characteristics as might be con-
cluded from their original habitats (Lüke et al., 2010; Semrau et al.,
2010). Hence, interpreting the similarity between the distribution
of type Ib and Ga-FeOB in our irregularly ﬂooded riparian site as
being groups that have similar ecological characteristics, would be
rather speculative. The most likely explanation for the strong co-
occurrence is the common dependence on oxic–anoxic interfaces
and microaerophilic conditions, which Ga-FeOB require to com-
pete successfully with chemical oxidation(Emerson et al., 2010)
and to ensure the availability of O2, Fe2+
, and methane. Addi-
tional support for common ecological niches comes from the fact
that type Ib MOB are abundant members of the MOB commu-
nity in rice ﬁeld soils (Lüke et al., 2010; Ho et al., 2011), a habitat

development of a cultivation-independent molecular detection
assay allows for the reliably revealing of Ga-FeOB in environmen-
tal settings (Wang et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010) and the ability to
relate their distribution to that of other microbes and chemical
oxidation processes. The strong correlation we ﬁnd in this study
between the abundance of Ga-FeOB and some of the MOB indi-
cates similar controlling factors, comparable competitive abilities
or both. The scarce culture information of FeOB shows that neu-
trophilic obligate FeOB (Weiss et al., 2007) have similar growth
rates as compared to methanotrophs (Dedysh et al., 2007; Belova
et al., 2011). However, growth rates under environmental condi-
tions can be quite different from optimal conditions in cultures
(Mohanty et al., 2006; Steenbergh et al., 2010) and thus the inter-
actions and competitive abilities of FeOB and MOB have to be
veriﬁed under environmental conditions.

which is very similar to the studied ﬂoodplain soil (Conrad et al.,
2008).

A striking phenomenon in our study was the clear deviating
Ga-FeOB and MOB abundances at the small (i.e., cm) scale. For
type Ia MOB and the FeOB, gene copies were below detection
limit in a large number of samples (Typ Ia 11 out 23, FeOB 17
out 23), but also for type Ib as well as type II the abundances
were generally signiﬁcantly lower. Siljanen et al. (2011) observed
much less spatial structure and variance at the cm scale within a
littoral hydrological gradient than at a larger scale. Abundance is
obviously affected by small scale differences, disconnected from
the large-scale environmental gradient. The only measured vari-
ables that deviated in small scale plot are moisture and organic
matter contents, which are both signiﬁcantly higher in the small
scale samples. The combination of these factors can put con-
straints on the availability of oxygen by a more intense competition
with heterotrophs (van Bodegom et al., 2001b). Nevertheless, the
lack of direct experimental evidence for competitive interactions
between heterotrophs, Ga-FeOB, and MOB renders every explana-
tion speculative. Fact is though that the observed local deviations
in diversity and abundance of Ga-FeOB and MOB would have

gone unnoticed in a more coarse sampling design along with the
useful ecological information associated to it. Other authors have
observed clear spatial patterns in response to agricultural man-
agement on meter scales (Philippot et al., 2009a,b; Wessen et al.,
2011) using geostatistical approaches. It would be exciting to see
whether the generalizations derived from these latter sampling
schemes would hold when small scale assessments would have
been executed.

Besides the variation between sampling scales there is also large
variation in gene abundance over several orders of magnitude
between samples from the same sampling scale, even when cm
apart. This holds both true for Ga-FeOB as well as MOB. Hence,
the possible solutions for the observed variability should come
from factors affecting both groups of microbes. Considering the
conﬂicting aspects of Fe(III) and methane availability (i.e., com-
petition of methanogens and iron reducers), oxygen would be the
most likely factor affecting both the distribution of Ga-FeOB and
MOB. The sampled ﬂoodplain soil consists of heavy clay which has
already limited air penetration that can even be worse when the
soil is compacted. The latter has been show to inﬂuence methane
oxidation in soil (Dalal et al., 2008; Gebert et al., 2011.). In this
ﬂoodplain this can both be caused by the ﬂoodwater itself but also
by trampling of the cows which are present in this area for nature
management purposes. This would lead to a highly irregular pat-
tern of compacted parts of the soil where possibilities for growth
and activity for aerobes are very limited. The higher number of
samples below the detection limit in the 20 cm× 20 cm plot may
be simply because due to the size of cores taken, the whole sur-
face area was samples and hence, the chance of hitting these “cold
spots”is simply higher as compared to the large- and medium-scale
samples.

Hence, heterogeneity of physico-chemical conditions and asso-
ciated substrate availability may one part of the explanation.

The physics of the soil may also inﬂuence biological factors
like predation by protozoa (Ranjard and Richaume, 2001). The
compaction may lead to a heterogenous pattern of soil space
inaccessible for protozoa, leading to locally higher numbers of
Ga-FeOB and MOB. However, since we have no detailed informa-
tion on soil-macro and microstructure for the respective samples
the explanations offered will remain speculative.

CONCLUSION
Gallionella-related neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria are abun-
dant throughout the studied riparian ﬂoodplain, their distribu-
tion reﬂecting the hydrological gradient. They outnumber various
groups of methane oxidizers, demonstrating that FeOB are both
able to compete for oxygen with methanotrophs as well as with
chemical iron oxidation. The spatial distribution of Ga-FeOB
resembles the distribution of type Ib MOB, whereas it deviates
from those of type Ia and type II MOB pointing to the fact only
one MOB subgroup has similar ecological strategies to Ga-FeOB.
Abundances of Ga-FeOB as well as MOB differed signiﬁcantly
from larger scales when sampled on cm scale demonstrating com-
mon local limiting factors, which may indicate environmental
boundaries for growth of Ga-FeOB and MOB.
