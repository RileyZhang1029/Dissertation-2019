Typical food and geographical 
indicaTions
Over  the  past  decades,  traditional  food 
systems  have  evolved  from  poorly  coor-
dinated networks to globalized complexes 
of  regulated  trade,  and  the  geographical 
indications  (GIs)  agro-food  market  size 
is  approximately  $50  billion.  Belonging 
to the intellectual property law as collec-
tive property rights, the “GI is a sign used 
on goods that have a specific geographi-
cal  origin  and  possess  qualities,  reputa-
tion, or characteristics that are essentially 
attributable to that place of origin” (World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), 
2011). The global impact of “GI” is widely 
testified through the scientific, social, and 
economic importance of traditional foods 
(World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO), 2011; World Trade Organization 
(WTO), 2011). In fact, GIs are known to be 
the earliest type of trademarks. From an 
edible perspective, this concept is simply 
and well presented by Bisson et al. (2002): 
“consumers expect wine from a particu-
lar region to possess unique qualities that 
differentiate  it  from  other  wines  of  the 
same varietal from other regions.” The GI 
system is based upon the concept of “ter-
roir,” a French word used to describe all 
geographical aspects of the environment, 
including  the  climate,  geology,  cultivar, 
human,  technical,  and  cultural  practices 
(and the interactions of these factors) that 
can influence local production. The form 
of  protection  is  generally  in  accordance 
with signed accords and treaties such as 
the  TRIPS  (Trade-Related  aspects  of 
Intellectual  Property  Rights)  Agreement 
or  the  Lisbon Agreement.  Even  if  at  the 
national  level,  they  are  specifically  pro-
tected by a variety of laws or instruments. 
For instance, in the European Union (EU), 
GIs  for  agricultural  products  and  food-
stuffs  are  protected  by  (EC  Regulation 
510/2006, 2006; these rules do not apply 
to  wine-sector  products  which  are  cov-

ered by separate rules; Kireeva, 2011) and, 
according to estimates, it represents a total 
annual sales volume of approximately €14 
billion  (Italy,  8.9;  France,  2.3;  Germany, 
2.0; Spain, 0.9; Profeta et al., 2009).

food Microbiology and 
geographical indicaTions
The  importance  of  fermented  foods  in 
the context of GIs is particularly relevant, 
due  to  the  historic,  cultural,  and  tradi-
tional  significance  (Battcock  and  Azam-
Ali,  1998;  Holtzman,  2006).  For  example, 
without considering wines, the percentages 
of the following food categories in the EU 
were:  37%  cheeses,  20%  beer,  16%  meat 
products, 4% fruit and vegetables, 4% bak-
ery  products,  biscuits,  confectionery  (EU 
Newsletter,  2010).  The  fermentation  of 
foods, the “oldest biotechnology,” has been 
an effective form of food preservation for 
millennia (Ross et al., 2002) and, as sharply 
observed  by  Suzzi  (2011),  the  knowledge 
on how wild strains become domesticated 
represents a common research priority for 
food microbiologists (for an overview of the 
principal selective processes involved in this 
phenomenon see Suzzi, 2011). Historically, 
food fermentations were based on naturally 
occurring  microorganisms,  and  in  the 
framework of industrial food production, 
food  bio-preservation  is  usually  achieved 
with  the  necessary  amount  of  selected 
strains (starter cultures) to ensure consist-
ency, safety, and quality of the final product. 
Microbial  ecology  of  food  fermentations 
continues to play a crucial and complex role 
in fermented foods. It is widely recognized 
that the emergence of a given microbiota in 
a food matrix influences the global quality 
and  uniqueness  of  the  final  product.  The 
study  of  microbial  biodiversity  related  to 
food  GIs  has  been  receiving  growing  sci-
entific  attention  and  world  interest  (e.g., 
Benito et al., 2007; De Angelis et al., 2008; 
Ercolini et al., 2008; Gala et al., 2008; Gullo 
and  Giudici,  2008;  Capozzi  et  al.,  2010; 

Csoma  et  al.,  2010; Valmorri  et  al.,  2010; 
Cocolin et al., 2011; Cordero-Bueso et al., 
2011;  Tristezza  et  al.,  2011).  In  GIs  prod-
uct  specification,  the  microbial  attributes 
are recognized as geographical (territorial) 
traits and/or as a part of production charac-
teristics (list of autochthonous species and 
strains,  preparation  of  the  natural  starter 
culture, use of specific commercial starter 
cultures,  the  chemico-physical  foodstuff 
factors  responsible  of  microbial  develop-
ment). It is important to underline that the 
commercial starter cultures use might lead 
to losses in “unique qualities,” while the pur-
suit of wild natural fermentations (natural 
starter culture) can result in fermentation 
arrests and/or the production of undesired 
metabolites responsible for food deprecia-
tion or human toxicity.

Microbes of proTecTed origin
Is it time for a GI regimen in food micro-
biology? Do microbial resources belong to 
“terroir” aspects? We argue that criteria on 
microbial  resources  employed  in  GI  fer-
mented foods should be clearly legislatively 
defined in the framework of policies on pro-
tected GIs. In fact, plant varieties and local 
animal breeds are not the only geographi-
cal attributes. GI fermented foods are also 
based on other forms of biodiversity, rang-
ing from traditional knowledge to microbial 
ecosystems. Even if the real characteristics 
and dimensions of strains of terroir (Renouf 
et al., 2006) remain a scientifically open ques-
tion, it appears that selective pressure from 
environmental parameters and processing 
conditions in addition to the geographical 
determinants contribute to the domestica-
tion process (Suzzi, 2011). Collectively, the 
role of microbial biodiversity for different 
food products and the repercussions on GI 
unique traits is clear. The technical proce-
dures in production of GI fermented foods 
might comprise a list of microbial strains 
representing the “virtuous” microbial bio-
diversity of a specific environment and for a

Microbial terroir

given food production. The autochthonous 
strains should have genotypic/phenotypic 
characterization in the context of applica-
tion and deposited in microbial collections. 
Different  cellular  biomarkers  (selected  by 
coupling  different-omics  strategies  and 
classical  microbiology)  should  be  used 
in  function  of  food  matrices  (nutrient 
potentials  and  stress  conditions)  and  of 
desired fermentative behavior. Mainly, the 
biomarker  should  be  quantitatively  cor-
related with stress adaptive behavior (den 
Besten et al., 2010; Abee et al., 2011) and 
fermentative performances. The biomarker 
strategy  accelerates  laboratory  screening 
and,  followed  by  the  necessary  industrial 
scale-up activities, leads to design robust-
ness and efficient starter culture formula-
tion for a given GIs production. An example 
of biomarker is the mRNA abundance of 
the  gene  encoding  the  only  small  heat 
shock protein in the malolactic bacterium 
Oenococcus  oeni  (Coucheney  et  al.,  2005; 
Capozzi  et  al.,  2010).  The  transcript  level 
was  positively  correlated  with  adaptation 
to  the  harsh  wine  environment  and  with 
malolactic performance (Coucheney et al., 
2005; Capozzi et al., 2010). Starting from 
the selected strains, GI fermented food pro-
ducers  might  formulate  their  own  multi-
strains starter culture. From this point of 
view, a concrete example is represented by 
Roquefort  product  specifications: “Before 
it  is  pressed,  the  raw  cheese  is  cultured 
with  spores  of  Penicillium  roqueforti  […] 
The Penicillium roqueforti culture is added 
either in liquid form at the renneting stage 
or in powder form when the curd is placed 
in the mold […] The cheese is left exposed 
in caves in Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, located 
in the scree of the Combalou mountain, for 
the length of time needed for the Penicillium 
roqueforti to develop successfully” (Official 
Journal  of  the  European  Union,  C  298, 
11/12/2007,  pp.  28–33).  “The  inocula-
tion is done with powders and cultures of 
Penicillium roqueforti prepared from tradi-
tional strains isolated in the microclimate 
of  the  caves  in  the  delimited  area  of  the 
town  of  Roquefort-sur-Soulzon  defined 
in the Article 6” (Ministère de l’agriculture 
et  de  la  pêche.  Décret  du  22  janvier  2001 
relatif  à  l’appellation  d’origine  contrôlée 
“Roquefort.” J.0. Numéro 21 du 25 janvier 
2001 page 1283). Summarizing, in the case 
of Roquefort, microbial resources were con-
sidered as part of the geographical attrib-

utes, belonging to the raw material (even if 
strain names are not specified, remaining a 
certain level of unclear microbial informa-
tion), and practices connected to microbial 
management are clearly defined.

Microbes of proTecTed origin and 
organic producTion
Also the organic agro-food system has been 
strongly evolved in the last two decades. The 
proposed innovations should also represent 
an economic, scientific, and environmental 
sustainable approach to assure the safety of 
organic fermented food, respecting an equil-
ibrated integration of traditional dynamics 
with advanced biotechnologies. As a matter 
of fact, when the organic food production 
requires a fermentation step, field-based evi-
dences indicate that an increasing number of 
manufacturers rely on wild microbial con-
sortia. They follow the idea that “synthetic 
pesticides  and  fertilizers”  are  to “farming” 
as “commercial microbial starter cultures” 
are to “food fermentations.” Naturally, this 
productive behavior may lead to microbial 
production  of  toxic  compounds,  such  as 
ochratoxin A, ethyl carbamate, and biogenic 
amines (Egmond et al., 2007; Spano et al., 
2010; Pozo-Bayón et al., 2012). As the mar-
ket for organic food continues to grow, the 
problem becomes more and more urgent. In 
this context, the food biotechnological sci-
entific community should offer an organic-
friendly solution able to reconcile organic 
viewpoint  with  safe  food  fermentations. 
Hence,  the  formulation  and  the  produc-
tion of a multi-strain microbial starter that 
mimics the natural diversity and function 
of the biotechnological processes might be 
a reliable alternative to organic uncontrolled 
fermentations, increasing the organoleptic 
qualities  of  production  and  minimizing 
the risk of foodborne pathogens, microbial 
toxic compound productions, and microbial 
spoilage.

perspecTives
The  principal  implication  of  a  systems 
ecology perspective is the improvement of 
product “unique qualities” via an enhanced 
management  of  microbial  biodiversity  in 
food  environments,  maintaining  a  high 
attention  to  biological  risks  for  human 
health and industrial exigencies of product 
standardization. Pertinent to this concern, 
we  underline  the  reliable  potential  of  a 
possible  world  driver  of “glocal”  innova-

tion  in  the  sector  of  one  of  the  “oldest” 
 biotechnologies, like wine- or bread-mak-
ing. With respect to technological transfer, 
this  interdisciplinary  (Max-Neef,  2005) 
innovation might lead to the development 
of opportunities for local research teams in 
microbial ecology and food microbiology, 
academic spin-off companies, bioentrepre-
neurs, and microbial collections. Hence, it 
would  be  an  exciting  opportunity  of  sys-
temic  design  (Kuehr,  2007),  distributed 
economies (Johansson et al., 2005), ex situ 
microbial biodiversity conservation (Gams, 
2004),  and  microbial  commons  regimen 
(Dijkshoorn et al., 2010) in the knowledge-
based bio-economy landscapes. Indeed, the 
proposed  approach  is  coherent  with  the 
existing  microbial  patenting  framework 
(Sekar and Kandavel, 2004; Webber, 2006), 
in fact a multi-strain starter culture essen-
tially satisfies the patentable criteria. Finally, 
highlighting the idea that microbial biodi-
versity belongs to the geographical attributes 
of fermented food, we propose a possible 
concrete role of microbial resources in eth-
nobiology and ethnomedicine, in accord-
ance  with  the  consideration  that  human 
food chain and microorganisms represent 
a case of co-evolution (Guerzoni, 2010).
