Scaffolding proteins that are associated

with glutamate receptors in dendritic
spines govern the location and function
of receptors to control synaptic trans-
mission. Unraveling the spatio-temporal
dynamics of protein-protein interactions
within components of
the scaffolding
complex will bring to light the function
of
these interactions. Combining bio-
luminescence resonance energy transfer
(BRET) imaging to electrophysiological
recordings, we have recently shown that
GKAP, a core protein of the scaffolding
complex, interacts with DLC2, a protein
associated with molecular motors.
Synaptic activity-induced GKAP-DLC2
interaction in spines stabilizes the scaf-
folding
the
NMDA currents. Interestingly, this work
placed emphasis on the bioarchitectural
dependence of protein-protein inter-
action dynamics. Depending on physio-
logical conditions,
the modulation in
space and time of protein-protein inter-
action is acutely regulated, engendering a
subtle control of synaptic transmission in
the state of the individual synapse.

The communication between neurons is
mainly achieved at the level of chemical
synapses.
In the presynaptic terminal,
synaptic vesicles containing neurotrans-
mitters (NT) are recruited to specialized
release sites termed active zones. Once
released,
the NT diffuses within the
synaptic cleft and binds to postsynaptic
receptors
the membrane
potential and initiate signal transduction
cascades. Glutamate is the main excitatory
NT in the mammalian brain. Most excita-
tory inputs find postsynaptic connections
at dendritic spines. Spines are postsynaptic

the control of receptor functions is well
established, the molecular detail of the
endogenous interactions and the roles that
they play in the regulation of synaptic
transmission is poorly defined because of
the dearth of methods for acutely and
specifically monitoring the binding inter-
actions and their dynamics. Recently, a
chemically based approach for acutely

proved the importance of scaffolds in the
stabilization of glutamate receptors at the

the
dynamics of such synaptic receptor scaf-

is an essential query. In particular, the
molecular mechanisms

postsynaptic targeting and assembly of
neurotransmitter receptors and associated
scaffolding proteins in the PSD are still
poorly understood. Guanylate kinase-
associated protein (GKAP)

protein of
the PSD95-GKAP-Shank-
Homer scaffolding complex linking glu-
tamate receptors (NMDA and group I
mGlu receptors, Fig. 1). This complex
governs glutamate receptor location and
function in dendritic spines.8-12 Interest-
ingly, GKAP also interacts with DLC2,13 a
light chain shared by cytoplasmic dynein
and myosin-V.14 This adaptor protein
functions as a molecular motor that drives
the trafficking of cargoes along micro-
tubules and actin filaments.15-17 The asso-
ciation of GKAP with molecular motors
raised the question of its functional inter-
action in the organization and activity of
the glutamate receptors. An original com-
bination of bioluminescence resonance
energy transfer (BRET) imaging18,19 with
immunofluorescence staining and electro-
physiological recordings recently allowed
us to better understand the physiological
role of GKAP-DLC2 complex in post-
synaptic glutamate receptor assembly and
function.20 Studying the spatio-temporal
dynamics of GKAP-DLC2 interaction in
living hippocampal neurons, we found
that GKAP-DLC2 interaction was pro-
minent in dendritic spines and could be
exacerbated by sustained synaptic activity.
Indeed DLC2 specifically interacts with
GKAP but not other PSD-associated
scaffolding elements. We showed that
GKAP-DLC2 interaction has two com-
plementary functions, both solicited by
neuronal activity (Fig. 1): First, GKAP-
DLC2 interaction within dendritic spines
stabilizes the postsynaptic complex at the
PSD, highlighting the role of DLC2 as a
hub protein that interacts with partially
disordered proteins
their
adequate organization. Second, GKAP-
DLC2 increases

to promote

expression of GKAP and its cognate
scaffolding partners in dendritic spines.
As a light chain of myosin V, DLC2 seems
to be an adaptor protein that functions
as a molecular motor to drive the specific
trafficking of GKAP toward dendritic
spines along actin filaments. The overall
functional consequence of GKAP-DLC2
interaction is the enhancement of NMDA
synaptic currents. This extended role of
GKAP-DLC2 complex is in agreement
with the existence of non-synaptic clusters
of synaptic proteins21 and would explain
the essential role of the actin cytoskeleton
in both maintenance and reorganization
of the PSD.22

signal

In their physiological

environment,
membrane receptors form complexes with
scaffolding proteins that link them to the
cytoskeleton as well as receptor’s intra-
cellular
transduction pathways.
Despite the relatively stable structure of
such receptor-associated scaffolds,
the
exchange of
individual adaptor proteins
within complexes can occur within a short
period of time and in a highly regulated
manner, which provides fine-tuning, speed
and specificity to the receptor’s signaling.
Depending on physiological conditions,
protein-protein interactions will be modu-
lated in space and time. Therefore, an
essential biological concern is to under-
stand how proteins are activated as free
molecules or part of complexes. Our study
throws new light on the spatio-temporal
dynamic of GKAP-DLC2 interaction and
its function. Thus, modulation of protein-
protein interactions within scaffold com-

transmission.
Interestingly, BRET signals
(reporting
the
interaction between GKAP and
DLC2) differed between spines. These
differences placed emphasis on physio-
logical disparities between spines. The
amount of proteins per spine may be
different, thus small differences in DLC2
and GKAP protein expression ratio will
influence the effectiveness of the inter-
action. But more importantly, spines are
dendritic protrusions allowing the isola-
tion of
the biochemical and electrical
signals generated by receptors. Neuronal
activity is not homogenous and will vary
from one spine to another, controlling the
efficiency of GKAP-DLC2 interaction.
DLC2 is a light chain of myosin V, this

adaptor protein links GKAP to the
molecular motor and drives the specific
trafficking of GKAP along actin filaments
up to the PSD in spines. This confirms the
critical role of filamentous actin in deter-
mining the extent of dynamic reorganiza-
tion in PSD molecular composition.22
Spines have
an elaborate mechanical
nature that is regulated by actin fibers.23
This morphology-dependent modulation
of protein-protein interactions introduces
a supplemental level of complexity in the
control of cell signaling. These subtle and
confined variations of interactions accur-
ately control the cell signaling. Regarding
neuron morphology in particular, spines
are especially advantageous to neurons due
to their role in compartmentalizing bio-
chemical and electrical signals. This can
help to encode changes in the state of an
individual
synapse without necessarily
affecting the state of other synapses of
the same neuron. This undoubtedly affects
the efficiency of protein-protein interac-
tions between spines.

We evidenced for the first time the
spatio-temporal occurrence and dynamics
of protein-protein interactions in living
neurons to control receptor function and
synaptic transmission.

The development of

sensitive tools
(rather than general approaches that miss
subtle variations of protein interactions in
space and time) is a major advance in the
field of cell
signaling. Thus, activity-
induced modulation can be directly com-
pared with the basal
interaction in the
same neuron, same spine, pixel by pixel.
The present
findings provide a novel
regulatory pathway of synaptic transmis-
sion that depends on activity-induced
remodeling of
the postsynaptic scaffold
protein complex. Other regulatory roles
for
soon be
revealed. For example, scaffold remodeling
also represents a form of homeostatic
control of synaptic excitability.24 Indeed,
the PSD95-GKAP-Shank-Homer scaffold-
ing complex disassembly (triggered by
sustained activation of synaptic NMDA
receptors) induces a physical and func-
tional
interaction between NMDA and
group I mGlu receptors.
Interestingly,
this protein scaffold remodeling is spine-
confined and results in a negative feed-
back loop on NMDA receptor activity. It

teins have a crucial
role in regulating
various signaling cascades in many other
cell types (such as immune-cell signaling,25

protein interactions within scaffolding
