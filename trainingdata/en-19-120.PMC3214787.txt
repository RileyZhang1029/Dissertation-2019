ABSTRACT

Alzheimer’s  disease,  the  most  common  cause  of  dementia,  is  characterized  by  two 
major  pathological  hallmarks:  amyloid  plaques  and  neurofibrillary  tangles.  Based  on 
these  two  indicators,  an  amyloid  cascade  hypothesis  was  proposed,  and  accordingly, 
most  current  therapeutic  approaches  are  now  focused  on  the  removal  of  β-amyloid 
peptides  (Aβ from  the  brain.  Additionally,  strategies  for  blocking  tau  hyperphosphory-
lation  and  aggregation  have  been  suggested,  including  the  development  of  drugs  that 
can  block  the  formation  of  tangles.  However,  there  are  no  true  disease-modifying  drugs 
in  the  current  market,  though  many  drugs  based  on  theories  other  than  Aβ and  tau 
pathology  are  under  development.  The  purpose  of  this  review  was  to  provide  in-
formation  on  the  current  development  of  AD  drugs  and  to  discuss  the  issues  related 
to  drug  development.

INTRODUCTION

    In  the  last  century,  the  world  transitioned  from  a 
young  to  aging  population  that  increasingly  suffers 
from  major  health  problems  such  as 
infectious 
disease  to  chronic  illness.  Especially,  neurodege-
nerative  diseases  are  a  major  concern  in  aged 
countries.  Among  these  diseases,  Alzheimer’s  di-
sease  (AD)  is  the  most  prevalent  with  the  number 
of  the  patients  about  30  million  worldwide,  and  this 
will  reach  more  than  80  million  in  2040  (Prince  and 
Jackson,  2009).

    AD,  the  most  common  cause  of  dementia,  is  a 
chronic  disorder  characterized  by  a  progressive  de-
cline  in  cognitive  function.  Major  pathological  hall-
marks  include  extensive  neuronal  loss,  formation  of 
intracellular  neurofibrillary  tangles  (NFT)  and  ex-
tracellular  deposition  of  β-amyloid  peptides  (Aβ). 
Despite  extensive  research,  the  cause  of  sporadic 
AD  (more  than  90%  of  all  AD)  is  still  unknown 
(Brunden  et  al.,  2009;  Bettens  et  al.,  2010).  Ad-
ditionally,  there  are  no  true  disease-modifying  drugs 
in  the  market;  drugs  currently  available  are  ace-
tylcholine  esterase  inhibitors  and  a  N-methyl  D- 
aspartic  acid  (NMDA)  receptor  modulator,  which  are 
for  symptomatic  treatments  only  (Mangialasche  et 
al.,  2010).
    Amyloid  cascade 
tauopathy  have 
been  proposed  as  the  cause  of  AD  based  on  two 
pathological  hallmarks  (NFT  and  Aβ).  Accordingly, 
drug  development  has  focused  on  the  removal  of 

theory  and 

Aβ and  NFT  from  the  brain.  However,  many  drugs 
are  currently  under  development  based  on  other 
theories  of  the  etiology  of  AD.  Disease-modifying 
treatments  are  highly  desirable  but  are  thus  far 
unsuccessful.  The  failed  efficacy  of  recent  multi- 
center  clinical  trials  could  be  due  to  systematic  and 
random  measurement  errors,  as  well  as  improper 
design,  monitoring,  analysis  and  interpretation  (Be-
cker  and  Greig,  2008).  However,  several  of  the 
compounds  currently  being  developed  could  be-
come  drugs  with  additional  technical  innovations 
and  methodological  improvements  for  clinical  trials.
    The  purpose  of  this  article  was  to  provide  a  brief 
overview  on  the  current  development  of  drugs  for 
Alzheimer’s  disease  and  offer  some  prospective 
comments.

DRUG  DEVELOPMENT  TO  TARGET  Aβ 

(TABLE  1)

    The  amyloid  cascade  hypothesis  is  a  compelling 
model  that  the  aberrant  production  of  Aβ 1-42  is 
the  causative  agent  in  the  pathogenesis  of  AD. 
There  are  many  strategic  approaches  to  reduce  the 
level  of  toxic  Aβ  1-42  in  the  brain:  (1)  immuno-
therapy,  (2)  γ-secretase  inhibitors,  (3)  β-secretase 
inhibitors,  (4)  Aβ  oligomerization 
inhibitors,  (5)

inhibitors  that  prevent  transport  of  Aβ from  blood 
to  the  brain,  (6)  degradation  of  Aβ.

Immunotherapy

to  avoid  an 

    Several  immunotherapies  targeting  Aβ have  been 
conducted  in  clinical  trials  based  on  previous  data 
on  improved  cognition  in  mouse  models  of  AD 
(Dodart  et  al.,  2002;  Kotilinek  et  al.,  2002;  Lee  et 
al.,  2006).  The  first  generation  vaccine  targeting 
Aβ  was  AN-1792,  but  its  phase  II  clinical  trial  (CT) 
was  discontinued  due  to  the  development  of  aseptic 
meningoencephalitis  in  6%  of  patients  (Gilman  et 
al.,  2005).  The  second-generation  vaccine,  ACC- 
001,  was  developed 
inflammatory 
response  and  currently  undergoing  phase  II  CTs 
(Fagan,  2008a). 
    Passive  immunizations  have  also  been  attempted. 
Among  them,  bapineuzumab,  a  humanized  mono-
clonal  antibody  targeting  Aβ,  completed  its  phase 
II 
to  moderate  AD  patients. 
Although  it  failed  to  show  a  clear  clinical  benefit,  it 
moved  to  phase  III  CTs  based  on  its  safety  and 
biomarker  data  generated  by  positron  emission 
tomography  (PET)  (Strobel,  2008a).  Recently  its 
highest  dose  (2  mg/kg)  was  abandoned  to  reduce 
the  risk  for  vasogenic  edema  (Strobel,  2009)  but 
the  interim  data  of  phase  III  show  reduction  of

amyloid  load  in  the  brains  (Landhuis,  2010b).  Like 
bapineuzumab,  LY2062430  (Solanezumab)  and  PF- 
04360365  are  monoclonal  antibodies  against  Aβ 
peptide.  The  former  completed  its  phase  I  and  II 
trials  and  is  currently  in  phase  III  (Siemers  et  al., 
2010;  CT  1  and  CT  2  in  ref.),  whereas  the  latter 
completed  phase  I  CTs  and  is  undergoing  phase  II 
(Landhuis,  2009a;  CT  3  in  ref.).     
    Since  a  mixture  of  intravenous  immunoglobulin 
(IVIg)  of  human  blood  contains  the  antibody  against 
Aβ  it  could  be  used  to  quench  a  pool  of  Aβ 
(Dodel  et  al.,  2002).  In  a  small  trial  (24  people)  for 
18  months,  IVIg  (Gammagard)  slowed  clinical  de-
cline  and  protected  brains  against  shrinkage.  The 
mechanism  for  protection  against  AD  could  be  due 
to  direct  targeting  of  Aβ  by  IVIg  or  an  indirect 
immunomodulatory  effect.  A  larger  (360  AD  pa-
tients)  multi-center  phase 
is  underway 
(Dodel  et  al.,  2010;  Fagan,  2010e).  There  are 
several  active  (AFFITOPE  AD01  and  AFFITOPE 
AD02,  GSK933776A,  MABT5102A  and  V950)  as 
well  as  passive  (R1450  and  RN  1219)  immuni-
zations  for  Aβ  under  development  currently  (Le-
mere  and  Masliah,  2010).

γ-secretase  inhibitors

(more 

    Gamma-secretase  is  the  final  enzyme  involved  in 
the  cleavage  of  amyloid  precursor  protein  (APP)  in 
the  membrane,  and  it  consists  of  a  complex  of  four 
different  proteins  (presenilin,  nicastrin,  Aph-1  and 
Pen-2)  (Takasugi  et  al.,  2003;  Wolfe,  2008).  Among 
the  four  proteins  in  the  complex,  presenilin  is  the 
key  enzyme  that  cleaves  APP.  However,  γ-se-
cretase  cleaves  other  proteins 
than  50 
protein  substrates)  in  addition  to  APP,  which  makes 
finding  an  APP-specific  inhibitor  for  γ-secretase 
very  difficult  (Beel  and  Sanders,  2008).  Further-
more,  presenilin  is  an  unusual  protein  with  more 
than  150  mutations  in  its  gene  that  are  autosomal 
dominant  for  the  early  onset  of  AD  (PS1  mutation 
database  in  ref.).  Many  mutations  discovered  in 
earlier  studies  increase  the  release  of  Aβ  42,  a 
neurotoxic 
the  brain. 
Accordingly,  strategies  for  blocking  its  enzymatic 
activity  have  been  intensely  pursued.  Regarding  γ- 
secretase,  substrate  specificity  is  challenging  be-
cause  it  cleaves  many  substrates  such  as  Notch, 
which  is  an  important  regulator  in  many  physio-

form  of  Aβ  peptides, 

in 

logical  processes  (De  Strooper  et  al.,  1999).
    The  first  in  vivo  proof  of  γ-secretase  as  a  the-
rapeutic  target  of  AD  was  obtained  using  DAPT  in 
a  transgenic  mouse  model,  which  resulted  in  re-
duced  Aβ  in  the  brain  after  oral  administration 
(Dovey  et  al.,  2001;  Lanz  et  al.,  2003).  LY411575 
showed  adverse  effects  on  the  immune  system  and 
intestine  in  a  mouse  model,  and  it  was  later  found 
to  have  poor  selectivity  for  APP  over  Notch  (Wong 
et  al.,  2004).  Additionally, 
the  side  effects  of 
LY411575  have  prevented  the  viability  of  a  clinical 
trial.  Later,  LY450139  (Semagacestat)  was  deve-
loped  to  avoid  such  adverse  side  effects.  Phase  II 
trials  with  LY450139  was  unusual  to  estimate  the 
clinical  endpoint  by  measuring  biomarkers  (e.  g.  the 
plasma  concentration  of  Aβ)  rather  than  measur-
ing  the  cognitive  or  clinical  improvements  (Strobel, 
2007b).  Even 
though  LY450139  did  not  have 
excellent  selectivity  for  APP  over  Notch  (E50=1：
2.8),  it  did  move  on  to  phase  III  trials  but  halted 
due  to  the  treatment  group  showing  faster  decline 
in  cognition  than  the  placebo  group  (Strobel,  2007a; 
Martone  et  al.,  2009;  Fagan,  2010d).
    BMS-299897  and  MRK-560  were  developed  for 
improvement  of  substrate  selectivity  of  γ-secretase, 
and  they  have  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  animal 
models  without  any  sign  of  Notch  inhibition  (Barten 
et  al.,  2005;  Best  et  al.,  2007).  However,  they  were 
not  found  in  the  stage  of  clinical  trials.  GSI-953 
(Begacestat)  also  has  excellent  selectivity  for  APP 
cleavage  over  Notch  (E50=1：16.8)  (Mayer  et  al., 
2008).  Phase  I  CTs  for  GSI-953  have  been  con-
ducted  but  no  data  have  been  disclosed. 
    In  addition  to  classical  inhibitor  approaches,  com-
pounds  that  modulate  the  enzymatic  activity  of  γ- 
secretase  have  been  developed.  Certain  non-ste-
roidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  have  been 
toxic  Aβ  42 
found 
(McGeer  and  McGeer,  2007).  For  instance,  ta-
renflurbil  (Flurizan),  which  is  the  R-form  of  flur-
biprofen  lacking  COX-inhibitory  activities,  was  the 
first  γ-secretase  modulator  to  be  developed  (Erik-
sen  et  al.,  2003;  Kukar  et  al.,  2007).  Tarenflurbil 
showed  promising  outcomes  in  early  preclinical  and 
clinical  trials.  However,  it  failed  to  show  any  dif-
ference  compared  to  the  placebo  group  in  phase  III 
CTs  (Green  et  al.,  2009).  This  failure  could  have 
been  due  to  an  insufficient  amount  of  tarenflurbil  in 

the  amount  of 

to  reduce

the  brain,  as  an  earlier  study  (21-day)  did  not 
reduce  Aβ42  in  the  plasma  or  cerebrospinal  fluid 
(CSF)  (Galasko  et  al.,  2007).
    Recent  data  suggest 
that  the  mechanism  by 
which  γ-secretase  modulates  NSAIDs  could  be 
based  on  binding  of  the  substrate  (APP  in  this 
case)  rather  than  γ-secretase  itself.  Binding  of  the 
compounds  to  APP  prevents  dimerization  of  APP 
and  shifts  the  cleavage  site  such  that  less  toxic  Aβ 
fragments  are  produced  (Richter  et  al.,  2010).
    Carriers  of  mutations  in  the  presenilin  gene  share 
heterogeneity  among  their  pathological  phenotypes. 
At  the  time  of  its  discovery,  it  was  suggested  that 
the  presenilin  gene  undergoes  gain-of-function  mu-
tations,  but  since  then  more  than  150  mutations 
have  been  identified  (PS1  mutation  database  in 
ref.).  Many  of  the  mutations  were  found  to  be 
reduction-of-function  by  in  vitro  assays  involving 
simpler  organisms  such  as  C.  elegans  (Okochi  et 
al.,  2000;  Wolfe,  2007).  Moreover,  conditional  knock-
out  of  PS1  in  postnatal  forebrain  leads  to  cognitive 
deficit  in  the  mouse,  suggesting  that  PS1  is  re-
quired  for  normal  neuronal  function  in  the  adults 
(Yu  et  al.,  2001).  This  could  be  a  significant  factor 
in  the  development  of  γ-seretase  inhibitors,  and 
the  cause  of  recent  failures  in  CTs  with  γ-se-
cretase  inhibitors  could  be  due  to  the  disturbance  of 
normal  presenilin  functions.

BACE  inhibitors 

    Beta-site  amyloid  precursor  protein  cleaving  en-
zyme  (BACE1)  was  cloned  to  measure  the  en-
zymatic  activity  of  β-secretase,  which  is  the  en-
zyme  responsible  for  initiating  Aβ generation  (For 
review,  Cole  and  Vassar,  2008).  Thus,  BACE  is 
one  of  the  best  drug  targets  for  the  therapeutic 
inhibition  of  Aβ  production.  Moreover,  it  is  con-
sidered  to  be  a  better  target  than  γ-seretase  for 
disease-modifying  drugs  since  the  knockout  mouse 
of  BACE1  does  not  produce  Aβ and  shows  only 
minor  behavioral  changes  (Cai  et  al.,  2001;  Ro-
berds  et  al.,  2001).  Even  though  the  structure  of 
BACE1  has  been  solved,  the  design  of  potent 
inhibitors  is  still  problematic  since  the  active  site  is 
so  large  (Hong  et  al.,  2000).  CTS-21166  (CoMentis) 
is  the  first  BACE1  inhibitor  tested  in  phase  I  CTs. 
According  to  information  provided  by  the  company, 
CTS-21166  is  safe,  well-tolerated  and  shows  do-

dose-dependent  reduction  of  plasma  Aβ in  phase  I 
CTs.  However,  its  trials  were  terminated  due  to 
additional  non-clinical  toxicology  data  which  was 
found  in  the  middle  of  the  CTs.  Nonetheless,  it  was 
clearly  demonstrated  that  BACE1  is  a  druggable 
target  (Rogers,  2010).  TAK-0707,  a  promising  non- 
peptidic  and  lipophilic  compound,  is  non-competitive 
for  substrates  and  results  in  reduction  of  Aβ and 
cognitive 
in  a  mouse  AD  model 
(Fukumoto  et  al.,  2010).  However,  no  CT  on 
TAK-0707  is  being  currently  conducted.  Other  com-
pounds  which  are  derived  from  peptidomimetics  and 
non-peptides  have  nano-molar  potency  in  in  vitro 
assays.  However,  they  lack  in  vivo  efficacy  data  in 
mouse  models.  (Hills  and  Vacca,  2007)
    Alternatively,  compounds  that  modulate  the  ac-
tivity  of  β-secretase  could  be  candidates  for  AD 
therapeutics.  Posiphen  is  enantiomer  of  phenserine 
and  is  inactive  in  inhibiting  acetylcholine  esterase 
while  phenserine  has  cholinergic  activity  (see  be-
low).  Posiphen  reduces  both  Aβ 40  and  Aβ 42  in 
mice  and  it  acts  by  reducing  β-secretase  activity 
as  well  as  that  of  APP  transcription  (Lahiri  et  al., 
2007).  Recently,  recruitment  is  ongoing  for  a  phase 
I  study  in  subjects  with  amnestic  mild  cognitive 
impairment  (CT  4  in  ref.). 
    The  recent  discovery  that  BACE1-knockout  mice 
produce  excess  sodium  channels  in  their  axons, 
have  increased  neuronal  excitability,  and  are  more 
susceptible  to  seizures  than  normal  mice  sends  a 
caution  to  the  developers  of  BACE1  inhibitors  (Hu 
et  al.,  2010).

Aβ  oligomerization  inhibitors

    Tramiprosate  binds  to  soluble  Aβ and  prevents 
formation  of  amyloid  plaques  (Gervais  et  al.,  2001). 
This  drug  was  the  first  to  have  been  developed 
based  on  amyloid  cascade  theory,  reaching  late- 
stage  development.  However,  the  outcome  of  its 
phase  III  CTs  was  not  conclusive  despite  promising 
results  in  phase  II  (Wong,  2007).  These  poor  re-
sults  could  have  been  due  to  its  promotion  of  tau 
aggregation  or  unusually  large  placebo  response 
rate  (Santa-Maria,  2007;  Wong,  2007).

    Phenserine  was  developed  as  an  inhibitor  of 
acetylcholine  esterase  and  later  demonstrated  cog-
nitive 
in  animal  models.  Use  of 
phenserine  reduced  the  amount  of  APP  by  mo-
dulating  APP  translation  through  interaction  with  the 
5’UTR.  Even 
though  moderate  success  was 
attained  in  phase  II,  the  drug  failed  to  show  any 
significant  benefit  over  placebo  in  phase  III  trials 
(Strobel,  2005).  ELND005  (formerly  known  as  AZD 
103)  is  a  scillo-inositol,  one  of  the  8  possible 
stereoisomeric 
the 
accumulation  of  Aβ  oligomers  and  suppressed 
memory  loss  in  transgenic  mice  (Hawkes  et  al.,

not  show  significant  improvements  in  cognition  even

(Fagan,  2010c).  PBT2,  an  anti-fibrillar  agent,  is  a 
metal-protein-attenuating  compound  that  alters  the 
interaction  between  Aβ and  metals.  The  phase  IIa 
trial  of  PBT2  showed  the  reduction  of  Aβ  42  in 
CSF  without  affecting  the  plasma  biomarkers  of  AD. 
Even  though  no  major  adverse  effects  were  ob-
served,  cognitive  improvement  was  restricted  to  a 
part  of  executive  functions  (Lannfelt  et  al.,  2008).

Inhibitors  of  Aβ  transport:  RAGE  inhibitors

    The  receptor  for  advanced  glycation  end  products 
(RAGE)  binds  Aβ and  transports  it  from  plasma  to 
the  brain  via  the  blood-brain  barrier  (Deane  et  al., 
2003).  Thus,  RAGE  has  been  suggested  as  a 
therapeutic  target  for  preventing  the  accumulation  of 
Aβ in  the  brain.  PF-04494700  (formerly  TTP488), 
the 
for  AD,  was  recently 
developed.  Phase  II  CTs  for  evaluation  of  safety 
and 
tolerance  have  been  completed.  Currently, 
phase  II  for  efficacy  is  underway  but  subjects  have 
not  been  recruited  (CT  5  in  ref.).

Degradation  of  Aβ

    Degradation  of  Aβ could  be  the  most  effective 
strategy  for  its  removal  from  the  brain.  There  are 
some  proteases  that  degrade  Aβ,  as  evidenced  in 
vivo  using  knock-out  or  over-expressing  transgenic 
mice.  Such  proteases  are 
insulin-degrading  en-
zymes,  including  neprilysin  and  plasmin  activator 
inhibitor-1  (PAI-1) 
inhibitor.  The  development  of 
compounds  that  enhance  the  degradation  of  Aβ is 
still  in  the  exploratory  stage.  The  only  compound 

that  has  reached  CTs  is  PAZ-417,  a  PAI-1  inhibitor 
(Jacobsen  et  al.,  2008).  Despite  the  possibility  of 
bleeding  by  activation  of  the  plasmin  system,  there 
were  no  severe  side  effects  in  any  animal  model. 
Two  phase  I  trials  have  been  completed  while  a 
third  was  terminated  (CT  6  in  ref.).

tau  could  be  an  effective 

    Even  if  Aβ is  considered  to  be  the  major  cause 
of  AD  pathology,  tau  could  play  an  important  role 
in  AD  pathogenesis  (Iwatsubo,  2006).  Therefore, 
blocking 
therapeutic 
strategy.  Tau  is  a  protein  found  in  the  cytoplasm 
that  binds  to  tubulin  for  the  stabilization  of  mi-
crotubules.  During  AD,  tau  is  hyperphosphorylated, 
resulting  in  NFTs  inside  neurons,  which  are  toxic  to 
neurons  (Iqbal  et  al.,  1994).  Kinases 
that  are 
involved  in  the  hyperphosphorylation  of  tau  are 
considered  as  drug  targets.  However,  there  are  not 
many  drug  candidates  compared  to  those  of  Aβ 
pathology.
    A  major  therapeutic  approach  for  tau  pathology 
is  developing  inhibitors  of  kinases  of  tau  hyper-
phosphorylation.  Several  kinases  are  reported  to 
phosphorylate  tau  protein,  including  Glycogen  syn-
thase  kinase  3β  (GSK3β),  cyclin-dependent  ki-
nase  5  (CDK5),  extracellular  signal-regulated  kinase 
(ERK),  P38  and  c-Jun  N-terminal  kinase  (JNK) 
(Iwatsubo,  2006).  Two  well  known  drugs  for  psy-
chiatric  disorders,  valproic  acid  and  lithium,  inhibit 
GSK3  and  reduce  tau  phosphorylation.  Although 
valproic  acid  reached  phase  III  CTs,  it  failed  to 
show  any  improvement  of  neuropsychiatric  symp-
toms  in  AD  patients  (Landhuis,  2009a).  Lithium  also 
failed  to  show  any  change  in  CSF  markers  or 
cognitive  improvement  in  a  small  trial  (Hampel  et 
al.,  2009).
    Among  the  several  GSK3  inhibitors  under  de-
velopment,  NP-031112  (NP-12),  which  is  non-com-
petitive  to  ATP,  reduces  tau  phosphorylation  and 
amyloid  deposits  in  the  brain  of  animal  models 
(Sereno  et  al.,  2009).  A  phase  II  trial  with  this  drug 
has  been  completed,  but  the  result  has  not  been 
published.
    Alternatively,  there  are  approaches  preventing  tau 
aggregation  or  promoting  aggregate  disassembly. 

Methylthioninium  chloride  (methylene  blue,  Rember), 
a  widely  used  dye  for  protein  staining,  interferes 
with  tau  aggregation  and  also  enhances  mitochon-
drial  function.  Phase  II  trials  showed  slow  disease 
progression,  but  efficacy  and  safety  still  need  to  be 
confirmed  in  phase  III  CTs  (Strobel,  2008b). 
    Davunetide  has  been  developed  as  both  an 
intranasally  administered  peptide  of  8  amino  acids 
(AL-108,  NAP)  and  as  an  intravenous  formulation 
(AL-208).  Although  the  neuroprotective  mechanism 
is  not  clear,  AL108  inhibits  tau  hyperphosphory-
lation  and  protects  the  brain  from  Aβ  toxicity  in 
animal  models  (Matzuoka  et  al.,  2007).  A  phase  II 
study  on  AL-108  in  patients  with  amnestic  mild 
cognitive  impairment  showed  positive  effects  on 
cognitive  function  (Fagan,  2009a).  However,  the 
study  was  short  (12  weeks)  and  needs  to  be 
confirmed  by  additional  studies.

OTHER  THEORIES  (TABLE  2)

its  neuroprotective  activity 

    Dimebon,  which  was  developed  as  a  non-se-
lective  antihistamine,  weakly  inhibits  acethylcholine 
esterase  (Bachurin  et  al.,  2001).  It  also  inhibits 
NMDA  receptors  and  voltage-gated  calcium  cha-
nnels,  but 
is  mainly 
derived 
the  enhancement  of  mitochondrial 
function  (Bachurin  et  al.,  2003).  A  phase  II  CT  in 
2007  showed  clear  improvement  for  all  outcome 
measures  (Doody  et  al.,  2008).  However,  the  same 
positive  results  were  not  confirmed  in  phase  III 
trials  (Fagan,  2010a).
    Since  AD  patients  show  reduced  insulin  signaling 
in  the  brain  and  diabetes  increases  the  risk  of 
developing  dementia,  there  are  many  approaches  to 
increase  insulin  in  the  brain.  Recently,  a  four-month 
phase  II  study  on  intranasal  administration  of  insulin 
in  patients  with  MCI  or  early  AD  showed  improved 
cognition  and  daily  function,  with  larger  phase  III 
trials  planned  (Landhuis,  2010a).  Insulin-like  growth 
factor-1  (IGF-1)  is  also  considered  a  treatment  for 
neurodegenerative  disorders.  However,  MK-677  (ibu-
tamoren  mesylate),  a  potent 
IGF-1 
secretion,  did  not  benefit  AD  patients  (Sevigny  et 
al.,  2008).  Recent  data  from  IGF-1  receptor  knock- 
out  mouse  is  more  confusing:  the  results  suggested 
that  reducing  insulin/IGF-1  signaling  helps  avoid

dementia  (Fagan,  2009b).  A  clinical  trial  to  assess 
the  relationship  between  the  levels  of  IGF-1  system 
components  and  cognitive  status  in  patients  with 
AD  is  underway  (CT  7).  Drugs  that  modulate  insulin 
signaling  have  also  been  developed.  However, 
rosiglitazone  and  pioglitazone,  both  peroxisome 
proliferator-activated  receptor-γ (PPARγ)  agonists, 
did  not  show  significant  benefits  in  patients  with 
mild  to  moderate  AD  (Strobel,  2006).
    Ginkgo  biloba  is  an  herb  that  is  widely  used  to 
prevent  and  treat  cognitive  decline  in  aging  people. 
However,  CTs  conducted  for  six  years  (2002∼
2008)  showed  that  daily  doses  of  standardized 
ginkgo  biloba  leaf  extract  failed  to  delay  the  de-
velopment  of  AD  in  1,545  treated  seniors  (Dekosky 
et  al.,  2008).  Huperzine  A  is  a  natural  alkaloid 
compound  with  neuroprotective  effects  in  addition  to 
inhibitory  activity  of  acetylcholine  esterase.  Despite 
positive  results  in  phase  II  CTs,  further  trials  are 
not  ongoing  (Wang  et  al.,  2009).
    Elevated  levels  of  cholesterol  are  associated  with 
a  risk  of  AD  (Kivipelto  and  Solomon,  2006),  and 
cholesterol-lowering  statins  have  been  suggested  to 
reduce  the  risk  of  AD.  A  transgenic  mouse  model 
was  used  to  demonstrate  that  a  high  level  of 
cholesterol  increases  the  production  of  Aβ (Refolo 
et  al.,  2000).  However,  clinical  studies  on  treatment 
with  statins  in  patients  with  AD  have  not  produced 
any  beneficial  effects  so  far.  Atorvastatin  failed  to 
show  any  benefit  in  phase  III  trials  (Feldman  et  al., 
2010),  and  trials  with  pitavastatin  or  simvastatin  for 
the  prevention  and  therapy  of  AD  are  ongoing

treatment 

(Fagan,  2008b).
    Epidemiological  data  and  a  neuroinflammation 
model  of  AD  suggest  that  NSAID  can  be  effective 
for  the  treatment  and  prevention  of  AD  (Townsend 
and  Pratico,  2005;  Tuppo  and  Arias,  2005).  To  find 
the  relationship  between  NSAIDs  and  AD,  four 
prospective  clinical  studies  were  conducted  and 
they  showed  a  reduced  risk  for  AD  upon  treatment 
with  NSAIDs.  However,  double  blind  randomized 
CTs  with  placebo  groups  failed  to  show  that  NSAID 
is  an  effective 
for  prevention  of  AD 
(ADAPT  Research  Group,  2009).  Recent  data  sug-
gest  the  prevention  should  be  done  in  very  early 
stage  of  AD  (Varvel  et  al.,  2009).
    Antagonists  or  agonists  of  many  neurotransmitter 
receptors  have  been  suggested  as  drug  candidates 
for  AD  (Doraiswamy  and  Xiong,  2006),  including 
SB-742457  (serotonergic,  5-HT6  receptor  antagonist; 
Maher-Edwards  et  al.,  2010),  PRX-03140  (5-HT4 
agonist,  terminated),  SR57746A  (xaliproden)  and 
Lecozotan  SR  (5-HT1A  receptor  antagonist,  lack  of 
efficacy),  SGS-742  (GABAB-receptor  antagonist,  un-
(α4β2-selective  neuronal 
successful),  AZD3480 
nicotinic  receptor  agonist;  Dunbar  et  al.,  2010), 
CX717  (AMPA-type  glutamate  receptor  modulator; 
Hampson  et  al.,  2009)  and  RO5313534  (MEM 
3454,  nicotinic  α7  receptor  agonist;  Rezvani  et  al., 
2009).
    Phosphodiesterase  4  inhibitors  show  neuropro-
tective  and  neurorengenerative  activities  in  a  mouse 
AD  model.  MK-0952  completed  phase  II  trials  in 
patients  with  mild  to  moderate  AD,  but  the  results 
have  not  been  published  and  no  further  clinical 
trials  are  going  (CT  8).  PF-04447943,  which  is  a 
selective  phosphodiesterase  9A  inhibitor,  was  tested 
for  its  AD  therapeutic  efficacy.  Phase  I  was  com-
pleted,  and  currently  AD  patients  are  recruiting  for 
phase  II  CTs  (Fagan,  2010b).
    Women  have  higher  risk  than  men  for  AD.  It 
could  be  due  to  changes  in  hormonal  regulation 
after  menopause.  Modulation  of  hormones  has 
been  suggested  as  a  treatment  for  AD  in  women. 
Raloxifene,  a  selective  estrogen  receptor  modulator, 
was  tested  for  the  prevention  of  cognitive  decline  in 
postmenopausal  women  with  osteoporosis.  High 
dose  (120  mg/day)  of  raloxifen  reduced  the  risk  of 
mild  cognitive 
(Yaffe  et  al.,  2005; 
Legault  et  al.,  2009).  However,  no  further  deve-

impairment 

to  deliver  NGF 

lopment  was  reported  for  the  drug  in  the  prevention 
of  AD.
    Nerve  growth  factor  (NGF)  supports  survival  and 
fiber  outgrowth  of  basal  forebrain  cholinergic  neu-
rons,  and  data  suggest  NGF  imbalance  activates 
the  production  of  Aβ,  leading  to  neurodegeneration 
in  AD  patients  (Cattaneo  et  al.,  2008).  There  have 
been  many  attempts 
to  basal 
forebrain  cholinergic  neurons.  However,  intracere-
broventricular  infusion  of  NGF  was  interrupted  by 
adverse  effects  (Eriksdotter  Jonhagen  et  al.,  1998). 
Nonetheless,  intracerebral  injection  of  genetically 
modified  cells  producing  NGF  showed  an  overall 
lower  rate  of  cognitive  decline  (Tuszynski  et  al., 
2005).  Encapsulated  biodelivery  of  NGF  cholinergic 
basal  forebrain  neurons  was  also  attempted,  and  it 
increases  expression  of  nicotinic  receptors  and 
cognitive  improvement  (Eriksdotte  et  al.,  2010).
    Neuroreplacement  therapies  for  neurodegenera-
tive  diseases  based  on  stem  cells  have  also  been 
suggested  (Sugaya  and  Merchant,  2008).  Other 
approaches  involving  vitamin  E  or  omega-3  poly-
unsaturated  fatty  acids  have  also  been  attempted 
but  the  results  were  inconclusive  (Freund-Levi  et 
al.,  2006;  Bjelakovic  et  al.,  2007).  Resveratrol,  a 
phenolic  compound  derived  from  grapes  and  red 
wine,  has  neuroprotective  effects  and  has  been 
suggested  for  AD  therapeutics  (Sun  et  al.,  2010).

CONCLUSION

    AD  is  a  complex,  multi-factorial  disorder,  the 
mechanism  of  which  has  not  been  fully  understood. 
After  considerable  success  in  the  drug  develop-
ment  of  symptomatic  AD  treatments,  the  clinical 
development  of  new  drugs  for  treatment  of  AD  has 
resulted  only  in  disappointment.  Considering  recent 
failures  in  clinical  trials,  more  innovative  approa-
ches  are  greatly  needed.  Approaches  based  on  a 
single  target  should  be  revised  because  there  are 
several  levels  of  interactions  (especially  environ-
ment)  in  AD  pathogenesis.  Therefore,  mutli-target 
therapies  should  be  considered  more  seriously,  with 
mitochondrial  protection  and  multi-target  directed 
ligands  serving  as  recent  examples.
    Most  of  the  positive  results  in  AD  animal  models 
have  not  been  recapitulated  in  clinical  trials,  which 
implies  that  the  current  animal  models  for  AD  drug 

Drug  Development  for  Alzheimer’s  Disease:  Recent  Progress 127

development  should  be  reconsidered.  Especially, 
rodent  models  might  have  a  more  powerful  ability  to 
recover  brain  cells  compared  to  that  of  human  brain 
(Harrison  et  al.,  2010).
    Many  studies  suggest  that  certain  lifestyle  factors 
could  modify  the  risk  of  developing  AD.  Among 
them,  physical  exercise  may  be  an  effective  way  to 
reduce  the  risk  of  AD.  It  has  been  demonstrated 
that  physical  exercise  increases  the  many  factors 
involved  in  neurogenesis  (e.g.  BDNF,  TrkB,  CREB, 
IGF-1),  contribute  to  Aβ  clearance,  and  improve 
cognition  in  animals  (Vaynman  et  al.,  2003;  Plou-
ghman  et  al.,  2007).
