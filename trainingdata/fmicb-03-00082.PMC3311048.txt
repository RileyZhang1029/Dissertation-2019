Bacterial communities can exert signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the biogeochemical cycling of
arsenic (As). This has globally important implications since As in drinking water affects the
health of over 100 million people worldwide, including in the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta
region of Bangladesh where geogenic arsenic in groundwater can reach concentrations of
more than 10 times theWorld Health Organization’s limit.Thus, the goal of this research was
to investigate patterns in bacterial community composition across gradients in sediment
texture and chemistry in an aquifer with elevated groundwater As concentrations in Arai-
hazar, Bangladesh.We characterized the bacterial community by pyrosequencing 16S rRNA
genes from aquifer sediment samples collected at three locations along a groundwater ﬂow
path at a range of depths between 1.5 and 15 m. We identiﬁed signiﬁcant differences in
bacterial community composition between locations in the aquifer. In addition, we found
that bacterial community structure was signiﬁcantly related to sediment grain size, and sed-
iment carbon (C), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) concentrations. Deltaproteobacteria and
Chloroﬂexi were found in higher proportions in silty sediments with higher concentrations
of C, Fe, and Mn. By contrast, Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria were in higher
proportions in sandy sediments with lower concentrations of C and metals. Based on the
phylogenetic afﬁliations of these taxa, these results may indicate a shift to more Fe-, Mn-,
and humic substance-reducers in the high C and metal sediments. It is well-documented
that C, Mn, and Fe may inﬂuence the mobility of groundwater arsenic, and it is intriguing
that these constituents may also structure the bacterial community.

INTRODUCTION
Throughout the last decade considerable research effort has
focused on characterizing the mechanisms leading to elevated
groundwater arsenic (As) concentrations in aquifers throughout
South Asia. These studies have demonstrated that groundwater As
mobility is affected by a number of factors including redox con-
ditions (Zheng et al., 2004), sediment properties (Winkel et al.,
2008), hydrology (Polizzotto et al., 2005), organic matter qual-
ity (Mladenov et al., 2010; Neumann et al., 2010), and microbial
activity (Islam et al., 2004; Dhar et al., 2011). In the Ganges–
Brahmaputra delta (GBD) region of Bangladesh, where ground-
water As concentrations are on average about 10 times higher than
the World Health Organization’s drinking water guideline value,
groundwater As concentrations are heterogeneous (van Geen et al.,
2003) and often decoupled from bulk sediment As concentrations
(Dhar et al., 2008). In the GBD, areas with high groundwater

As concentrations typically share similar sediment characteristics,
hydrology, and organic matter chemistry. Sediment layers within
aquifers containing higher proportions of ﬁne-grained material
such as silts generally feature higher groundwater As concentra-
tions than sands (van Geen et al., 2006a), which, by contrast, tend
to have lower organic matter concentrations. Silty layers have a
lower permeability, thereby favoring the accumulation of dissolved
As in the groundwater (van Geen et al., 2006b). In addition, ﬁne-
grained sediments often exhibit higher concentrations of sediment
organic matter and metals including iron (Fe), manganese (Mn),
and As (McArthur et al., 2004), which may fuel relevant microbial
processes.

Indeed, it is clear that microbial processes are also impor-
tant in regulating As mobilization in the GBD (Islam et al.,
2004; Radloff et al., 2008). Groundwater As mobilization may be
enhanced in ﬁne sediments, as microorganisms pair the oxidation

of organic carbon (C) to the reductive dissolution of Fe-oxides
(Lovley and Phillips, 1988), which liberates As from Fe-oxide
mineral surfaces (Cummings et al., 1999; McArthur et al., 2001;
Tufano and Fendorf, 2008). To a lesser extent, the desorption
of As from the microbial reduction of Mn oxides may also
promote elevated As concentrations (Inskeep et al., 2002; Luna
et al., 2009), and the release of reduced Mn into groundwa-
ter often occurs with the release of As (Zheng et al., 2004; van
Geen et al., 2006b). In addition, microorganisms reduce humic
substances (HS; Mladenov et al., 2010) which promotes an elec-
tron cascade resulting in Fe-oxide reduction and As desorp-
tion (Kappler et al., 2004; Jiang and Kappler, 2008), as well as
the reduction of As(V) to the more mobile As(III; Jiang et al.,
2009). Microorganisms can also enhance As mobility in anaer-
obic aquifers by mediating redox reactions with As. Speciﬁcally,
the detoxiﬁcation pathway encoded by the ars operon (Rosen
et al., 1991; Macy et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2004) and dissimila-
tory As(V) reduction (Saltikov and Newman, 2003) results in
the reduction of As(V) to As(III). Also, microorganisms trans-
form As species during methylation (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2002)
although evidence of methylation has not been observed in the
GBD environment (Islam et al., 2004). By contrast, microbial
sulfate reduction can decrease the mobility of As in groundwa-
ter (Kirk et al., 2004; Saalﬁeld and Bostick, 2009). Sulﬁde co-
precipitates with As(III) and Fe to form As trisulﬁde (Newman
et al., 1997) under anoxic, reducing conditions (Rittle et al., 1995).
Given the diverse array of microbial metabolisms with potential
affects on As cycling, a better understanding of the patterns in
microbial community structure across sediment characteristics
could help elucidate the roles of speciﬁc taxa involved in bio-
geochemical processes that affect As mobility in these anaerobic
aquifers.

Recent research investigating the role of microbial communities
in groundwater As cycling has used molecular phylogenetic tools
to characterize the taxonomic composition of microbial commu-
nities in the GBD groundwater environment. The analysis of SSU
rRNA gene sequences from microcosm experiments with As-rich
aquifer sediment show the addition of a labile C source pro-
motes bacterial community shifts characterized by an increased
proportion of Deltaproteobacteria, and corresponding increases
in Fe-reduction and As mobilization (Islam et al., 2004; Lear et al.,
2007; Rowland et al., 2007), as well as bacterial sulfate reduction
(Héry et al., 2010). These microcosm results indicate that patterns
in bacterial community composition are related to changes in As
cycling in groundwater environments. However, questions remain
about the types of microorganisms found in ambient conditions
in the environment, and how their distribution varies with native
geochemical conditions.

Thus, the goal of this work was to advance our understanding
of microbial communities in As-rich groundwater sediments by
combining high-throughput gene sequencing methods with envi-
ronmental chemistry and statistical analysis. We were especially
interested in the investigation of relationships between environ-
mental chemistry and microbial community structure at the level
of the entire aquifer since previous research at our study site has
shown that groundwater arsenic increases with aquifer depth and
location along the ﬂowpath (Radloff et al., 2008; Mladenov et al.,

2010), and that dissolved organic matter chemistry changes with
depth (Mladenov et al., 2010). We used the natural environmental
gradients created by the groundwater ﬂowpath and depth within
the aquifer to demonstrate that patterns in bacterial community
composition are correlated to sediment chemistry across a ground-
water As concentration gradient in a GBD aquifer. The results from
this work show that bacterial community structure is signiﬁcantly
different between separate locations in the groundwater aquifer.
In addition, we demonstrate that variations in sediment grain size,
as well as sediment C, Mn, and Fe concentrations correspond to
variations in bacterial community structure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SITE DESCRIPTION
This research was conducted at Site K (Radloff et al., 2008) in Arai-
hazar, Bangladesh, approximately 30 km northeast of Dhaka (23˚
47
E). The regional climate is monsoonal, and
receives more than 50% of the annual precipitation (average of
2354 mm) between June and September (Immerzeel, 2008). Con-
sequently, like similar sites in Araihazar (Stute et al., 2007), stream
and groundwater levels at Site K vary seasonally and peak during
July and August when most of the study site is ﬂooded. Site K is
located in a rural area within the ﬂoodplain of the Old Brahmapu-
tra River, an abandoned river channel that has been ﬁlled through
sedimentation and reduced to a small stream (Figure 1). Previous
research at Site K has extensively characterized the hydrology and
groundwater geochemistry (Radloff et al., 2008; Radloff, 2010).
Like elsewhere in the GBD, shallow groundwater As concentra-
tions are spatially variable, and can exceed 400 μg/l (Radloff et al.,
2008). We examined groundwater and sediment samples from
three monitoring nests along a groundwater ﬂowpath at the study
site. Well nest K240 is located 240 m from the river within a village,
whereas well nests K150 and K60, located 150 m, and 60 m from
the river respectively, are located within cultivated rice ﬁelds. Based
on groundwater age estimates, the mean direction of groundwater
ﬂow at the study site is from the village to the Old Brahmaputra
River (Radloff, 2010). Thus, K240 is located near the beginning
of the groundwater ﬂowpath, K150 is located in the middle, and
K60 is located at the end of the ﬂowpath, directly upgradient
of the river (Figure 1). During the wet season (approximately
May–October), all three well nests at Site K are completely satu-
rated due to groundwater table rise, with the exception of depths
between 0 and 0.5 m within the village. In February, at the height
of the dry season (Stute et al., 2007), depths between 0 and 3 m
below the ground surface are unsaturated at all sampling locations
at Site K.

The groundwater chemistry at Site K changes with loca-
tion along the ﬂowpath and depth within the aquifer (Radloff,
2010). Like other sites in Araihazar (Dhar et al., 2008), there are
not marked seasonal changes in groundwater As concentrations
(Radloff, 2010). Dissolved groundwater Fe and As concentrations
are lowest at shallow depths at K240, and generally increase with
depth at each well location (Radloff, 2010). In addition, ground-
water As concentrations increase along the groundwater ﬂowpath,
and peak at K60 at 15 m (429 μg/l). Groundwater Mn, by contrast,
does not show patterns with depth or position along the ﬂowpath
(Radloff, 2010).

SAMPLE COLLECTION AND PREPARATION
We used the natural environmental gradients created by the
groundwater ﬂowpath and depth within the aquifer to examine the
relationship between sediment chemistry and bacterial commu-
nity composition. We collected sediment cores from three different
sites within the aquifer, K240, K150, and K60 (Figure 1), adjacent
to the monitoring well nests in July 2008. At each location we
collected cores from seven aquifer depths: 1.52, 3.05, 4.57, 6.10,
7.62, 10.67, and 15.24 m. We rinsed the sediment core liners with
100% ethanol prior to placing them in the coring device in order
to minimize contamination. Also, we excised the top and bottom
of each core with an ethanol-sterilized saw to remove sample that
had contact with drilling ﬂuids. We preserved the sediment cores
in airtight mylar bags with oxygen-absorbing packets and placed

them on ice in the ﬁeld for approximately 4 h; thereafter the cores
were stored at −80˚C. In the laboratory we opened each sediment
core with a sterilized dremel tool, placed the sediment in a sterile
bag, and then homogenized the sediment by hand from the 21
different cores (seven depths at three sites). During sieving, we did
not observe plant roots or invertebrates such as worms.

SEDIMENT CHEMICAL AND GRAIN SIZE ANALYSES
We measured pH with an Accumet® AB15 pH meter (Fisher Sci-
entiﬁc, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) in each of the homogenized
sediment core samples after adding 1 g of the wet sediment to 1 ml
of de-ionized water (Carter, 1993). In order to quantify the per-
centage of C and nitrogen (N) in each sample we ﬁrst dried 5 g of
homogenized sediment at 70˚C for 48 h; dried sediments were then

ground to a ﬁne powder (Cleveland et al., 2006). We used a Thermo
Scientiﬁc FlashEA 1112 Elemental Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tiﬁc, Inc.,) with high temperature (950˚C) dry combustion to mea-
sure the percentage C and N in each sample (Matejovic, 1997). We
estimated soil moisture in sediment samples by dividing the differ-
ence between the mass of the wet sediment and the mass of dried
sediment by the mass of the wet sediment. The Laboratory for
Environmental and Geological Studies (LEGS) at the University
of Colorado (http://www.colorado.edu/geolsci/legs/indexa.html)
conducted the analysis for determining the concentrations of Mn,
As, and Fe in each oven-dried, homogenized sediment sample. Sed-
iment concentrations of Mn, As, and Fe were determined using a
protocol modiﬁed from Farrell et al. (1980). Brieﬂy, 5 ml of a 7:3
mixture of hydrochloric acid and hydroﬂuoric acid and 2 ml of
nitric acid were added to sediment samples in digestion tubes.
Tubes were then heated to 95˚C in a digestion block for 2 h. Next,
samples were cooled and the volume of each sample was increased
to 50 ml with a 1.5% by weight boric acid solution. Samples were
reheated to 95˚C for about 15 min, and then cooled to room tem-
perature again. Metals concentrations were analyzed in the cooled
solutions on a SCIEX inductively coupled plasma mass spectrom-
eter, (Elan DRC-e, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) using an
Indium internal standard.

We used a second set of aquifer sediment samples collected at
K240, K150, and K60 from depths between 1 and 16 m to inves-
tigate grain size. We used a modiﬁcation of the USGS East Coast
Sediment Analysis Procedures protocol for this analysis (Poppe
et al., 2000). Sediments were freeze-dried for 48–72 h and then
oven-dried at 60˚C for 48 h. In order to disaggregate the sedi-
ment, we suspended samples in distilled water for 24 h. Then we
passed each wet sub-sample serially through 150 and 63 μm sieves.
Sediment fractions were dried and weighed and grain size distrib-
utions were reported as percentage sand (i.e., greater than 150 μm
in diameter), silty-sand (between 150 and 63 μm in diameter),
and silt (63 μm in diameter and smaller; Wentworth, 1922). In the
statistical analyses we included data from only one grain size class,
percentage silt, since percentage sand, percentage silty-sand, and
percentage silt were strongly autocorrelated.

PHYLOGENETIC DATA ANALYSIS
DNA was extracted from homogenized sediment samples using
the Mo Bio PowerSoil™DNA Isolation Kit following the manu-
facturer’s suggested protocol (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc., Carls-
bad, CA, USA). We PCR-ampliﬁed bacterial 16S rRNA genes
from the genomic DNA of the 21 sediment samples for pyrose-
quencing (Margulies et al., 2005) analysis. We used a univer-
sal bacterial primer set described in Hamady et al. (2008) that
(cid:2)
included the highly conserved bacterial primers 27F (5

and 338R, with a unique, error-correcting barcode that iden-
tiﬁes the PCR product in each sample (5

;
Fierer et al., 2008). Each reaction contained 3 μl of genomic
DNA, 30 μM (ﬁnal concentrations) forward and reverse primers,
and 22.5 μl of Platinum SuperMix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Reaction conditions were performed as described by Fierer
et al. (2008). We performed PCRs for each of the 21 samples

(cid:2)

in triplicate, and then pooled the products from each sample
for downstream processing. No template controls were included
to ensure that sample DNA was not contaminated with foreign
DNA. PCR products were cleaned with the Mo Bio UltraClean-
htp PCR Clean-up Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc.,) according to
the manufacturer’s recommended protocol, and then pooled in
equal concentrations. The University of South Carolina Environ-
mental Genomics Core Facility performed the sequencing of our
16S rRNA gene amplicons on a Roche FLX 454 pyrosequencing
machine.

First, we used QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010a) to apply a
sequence quality ﬁlter to the original 16S rRNA gene sequence
dataset based on the sequence quality log ﬁle. This quality ﬁl-
ter eliminated sequences that were shorter than 200 nucleotides
in length, in addition to those with one or more ambiguous
bases, and/or had received a quality score of less than 25. After
this sequence quality ﬁlter, pyrosequencing yielded 31,517 qual-
ity short-read (average length of 231 nucleotides) 16S rRNA gene
sequences total, and an average of 1500 sequences per sample (with
a SD of 189). We used QIIME to conduct all of the following phy-
logenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA sequences (Caporaso et al.,
2010a). We deﬁned bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
at 97% identity with the uclust (Edgar, 2010) and the cd-hit algo-
rithm (Li and Godzik, 2006). As a source for comparison, we also
deﬁned bacterial OTUs at 90, 95, and 99% identity with the cd-hit
algorithm. We conducted all of the subsequently described analy-
ses on each of these OTU tables in order to identify any discrepan-
cies based on the OTU deﬁnition and patterns between bacterial
community structure and chemistry (ﬁve tables total). Next, we ﬁl-
tered our dataset to eliminate OTUs represented by only one 16S
rRNA gene sequence (singletons), as well as OTUs present in only
one sample (Zhou et al., 2011). The number of sequences present
in each sample after applying ﬁltering is included as Table A1 in
Appendix. Then, we aligned the 16S rRNA gene sequences using
the PyNAST alignment algorithm (Caporaso et al., 2010b) with the
Greengenes database (DeSantis et al., 2006). In QIIME, we used the
RDP Classiﬁer (Wang et al., 2007) to assign the taxonomic classiﬁ-
cation to each OTU using the Greengenes database (DeSantis et al.,
2006). To create a phylogeny, we implemented the FastTree algo-
rithm (Price et al., 2009). We performed rarefaction analysis, and
calculated collector’s curves (Schloss and Handelsman, 2004) for
many different alpha diversity metrics including the Chao1 rich-
ness estimator (Chao, 1984) and Shannon diversity index (Weaver
and Shannon, 1949). To investigate patterns in beta diversity, we
calculated the pairwise distances between bacterial communities
with the UniFrac distance metric (Lozupone and Knight, 2005).
Sequences and sediment chemistry parameters were deposited in
the MG-RAST database (Meyer et al., 2008) under accession num-
ber qiime:130 according to MIMARKS standards (Yilmaz et al.,
2011).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We used univariate and multivariate statistical techniques in order
to elucidate relationships between the natural gradients within the
aquifer, such as depth and well location, and the environmental
chemistry and the bacterial community. We applied log transfor-
mations to percentage sediment C concentration, and square-root

transformations to sediment As and Fe concentrations because the
raw data for these variables had non-normal distributions (Gotelli
and Ellison, 2004). Then we performed linear correlation analy-
ses using MATLAB® 7.9.0 (2009b) and the Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient (Zar, 1999). We performed permutational multivariate
ANOVA tests using the adonis function in the vegan package in
R (Oksanen, 2007) in order to evaluate the role of depth and well
location in structuring the bacterial community, as characterized
by both unweighted UniFrac distances and proportions of bacter-
ial taxa within the aquifer. Then, to examine the effects of sediment
chemical parameters on structuring bacterial communities we per-
formed Mantel tests on the bacterial community structure (i.e., the
UniFrac distance matrix) and sediment chemistry data.

Next, we performed non-metric multidimensional scaling
(NMDS), an unconstrained ordination technique, with the
metaMDS function in the vegan package in R (Oksanen, 2007)
on the unweighted UniFrac distance matrix in order to further
examine patterns in bacterial community structure and environ-
mental parameters. Then we used the envﬁt function in the vegan
package in R (Oksanen, 2007) to ﬁt vectors of the environmental
parameters that were signiﬁcantly related to bacterial commu-
nity structure in the Mantel tests (square-root transformed Fe,

log transformed %C, Mn, and % silt) to the NMDS ordination
(Oksanen, 2007).

RESULTS
SEDIMENT GRAIN SIZE AND CHEMISTRY
The percentage of the sediment classiﬁed as sand ranged from
2.5 to 96 while the percentage silt ranged between 1.4 and 76.8
(Figure 2). The range in percentage silty-sand was from 1.6 to
77.4%. The grain size distribution of the sediment samples var-
ied based on the sample depth. Silt-sized grains predominated
in the sediments collected at shallow depths (<7 m) within the
aquifer, whereas sediments collected at deeper depths (>7 m) were
primarily composed of sands. Sediment C ranged from 0.04 to
0.67% across all samples (Figure 3), while sediment N was at or
below the detection limit of the analytical method (0.01%) for 15
of the 21 samples. The samples were all circumneutral and pH
ranged from 6.9 to 7.8. Sediment Mn concentrations ranged from
∼140 to 1100 ppm, Fe from 10 to 50 ppt and As from 5 to 39 ppm
(Figure 3). Sediment Mn concentration was the only chemical
parameter that showed statistically signiﬁcant differences between
well sites, and was nearly twice as high at K60 than at K150 or K240
(ANOVA, p < 0.05). Depth was signiﬁcantly negatively correlated

BACTERIAL COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS
Rarefaction analysis demonstrated that there was a large varia-
tion in the total number of OTUs between the samples. Collector’s
curves for the Chao1 richness estimator and Shannon diversity
index showed that the overall diversity approached an asymptote
in a majority of the samples (Figure A1 in Appendix), suggesting
that the sequence coverage was sufﬁcient to capture the diversity of
the bacterial communities. Interestingly, it appeared that the alpha
diversity of samples was related to the well location: the number of
OTUs per sample was highest at Well K240 and lowest at well K60.

Although 35 phyla were present in the 21 samples, only four
phyla comprised more than 5% of the community in every sam-
ple (Figure 4). Proteobacteria comprised approximately 28%
of the average community across all samples, whereas Chlo-
roﬂexi and Acidobacteria each comprised approximately 11%
of the community. The proportion of Firmicutes was approxi-
mately 5%, while other phyla represented much smaller propor-
tions of the bacterial communities. Acidobacteria and Firmicutes
were highly variable, with ranges in proportions of two orders
of magnitude across all of the bacterial communities sampled,
whereas the proportions of Chloroﬂexi and Proteobacteria varied
by roughly one order of magnitude across the 21 samples. The
sub-phyla Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Deltapro-
teobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria composed an average of
7, 7, 8, and 5% of the overall bacterial community, respectively.

FIGURE 4 |The bacterial communities, as characterized by the UniFrac
metric, are signiﬁcantly distinct at the three well locations at our
study site (PERMANOVA, R 2 = 0.23; p ≤ 0.001). The bar graphs show the
relative abundances of dominant (>5% total abundance) bacterial taxa at

the three well locations (n = 7 depths for each well) and in all wells
combined. Although there are gradients in sediment texture and chemistry
within the aquifer, only Mn was signiﬁcantly different between wells
(ANOVA, p < 0.05).

Bacterial community composition was not signiﬁcantly related
to depth (Table 1). Instead, bacterial communities clustered by well
site; a permutational multivariate ANOVA using the adonis func-
tion in the vegan package (Oksanen, 2007) revealed that well site
accounted for a signiﬁcant amount of the variation in community
composition (R2 = 0.23; p < 0.001). This relationship was signif-
icant (p < 0.05) for unweighted UniFrac distance matrices calcu-
lated from the pre-ﬁltered and ﬁltered datasets, and OTU tables
calculated from different clustering methods (uclust and cd-hit)

and different identity thresholds (90, 95, 97, and 99%). Next, we
investigated how the proportions of bacterial taxa contributed to
these observed differences. The proportions of the most common
(at least 5% of the total community) bacterial phyla and sub-
phyla along the groundwater ﬂowpath were signiﬁcantly different
between well locations (p < 0.05). Speciﬁcally, Deltaproteobacte-
ria and Chloroﬂexi were found in higher relative abundance while
Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria,
and Firmicutes were in lower proportions in K60 (near the river)

FIGURE 5 | As shown in the Venn diagram, a greater percentage of the
OTUs present within the bacterial communities at well locations K240

In addition, K150 and K60 shared a greater percentage of OTUs
(approximately 30%).

than K150 (middle of the ﬂowpath) or K240 (village site, Figure 4).
The proportion of Acidobacteria was highest at K150, and lowest
at K60.

While roughly 30% of the OTUs in the bacterial communi-
ties at well K240 and well K60 were unique to that location, 17%
of the bacterial communities at K150 were comprised of unique
OTUs (Figure 5). Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobac-
teria, and Betaproteobacteria were the most frequently observed
OTUs unique to well K240. Acidobacteria dominated the unique
OTUs at K150. The OTUs that were unique to K60, the site closest
to the river, were primarily Chloroﬂexi (30%), and 50% of these
Chloroﬂexi OTUs were classiﬁed in the Dehalococcoidetes class.
All three of the well locations shared 294 OTUs; a majority of
those OTUs (22%) were classiﬁed within the Acidobacteria. The
bacterial communities at K150 and K60 had the highest number of
shared OTUs, which largely belonged to the Chloroﬂexi, Acidobac-
teria, and Deltaproteobacteria (comprising 16, 15, and 11% of the
shared OTUs, respectively), the taxa that comprised the largest
proportion of the 16S rRNA gene dataset at Site K. Only two
taxonomic groups, Acidobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, each
comprised greater than 10% of the OTUs shared between K240
and K150. By contrast, the OTUs common to K240 and K60 were
more taxonomically distributed: OTUs in the Betaproteobacteria,
Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes
each comprised greater than 10% of the shared OTUs between
K240 and K60.

Mantel tests revealed that bacterial community composition,
as characterized by the unweighted UniFrac metric (Lozupone
and Knight, 2005), was signiﬁcantly related to percentage silt, and
sediment C, Mn, and Fe concentrations, but not sediment As or
pH (Table 1). We performed the Mantel tests using unweighted

FIGURE 6 | This non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)
ordination shows that the bacterial communities cluster based on well
location. Each point on the ordination is a different bacterial community
(n= 21), and the location of the points is based on UniFrac distances. The
points are colored based on well location. In addition, the vectors on the
ordination represent the gradient in the chemical variables for all the
samples in the dataset.

UniFrac distance matrices calculated from the pre-ﬁltered and
ﬁltered datasets, as well as OTU tables calculated from different
clustering methods (uclust and cd-hit), different identity thresh-
olds (90, 95, 97, and 99%), and different numbers of sequences
per sample (Table A2 in Appendix). We found signiﬁcant rela-
tionships between bacterial community structure and percentage
silt, and sediment C, Mn, and Fe concentrations for each of these
UniFrac distance matrices (Table A2 in Appendix) suggesting that
the correlations observed are robust to issues related to sampling
and OTU deﬁnition.

The results from the NMDS analysis, depicted in an ordination
plot (Figure 6), demonstrate the relationship between bacterial
community structure and environmental parameters. Each point
on the ordination represents a bacterial community from a spe-
ciﬁc sample location and depth. The distances between samples
(points) in the ordination indicate their level of similarity, as char-
acterized by unweighted UniFrac distances. In order to investigate
the validity of the NMDS ordination analysis we performed a stress
plot, which showed that the UniFrac distances and the ordination
distances were highly correlated (R2 = 0.98).

The NMDS ordination (Figure 6) demonstrates that bacter-
ial communities, in general, cluster based on well location, which
supports results from a permutational multivariate ANOVA. Also,
the ordination shows that bacterial communities at K60 are more
different from one another than at the other well
locations.
Whereas bacterial communities from the deepest depths at K60
cluster with communities from K150, bacterial communities at
depths of 3.05 m, 4.57 m, and 6.1 m at K60 form a distinct cluster
between 0.6 and 0.7 on NMDS axis 1 (Figure 6). Similarly, the

bacterial community from the shallowest depth at K60, 1.52 m,
is positioned at roughly 0.55 on NMDS axis 2, far from the
other communities on the ordination (Figure 6). This suggests
that the bacterial community structure at 1.52 m at K60 is dis-
tinct from bacterial communities at other locations at the study
site. The direction and position of the environmental parame-
ter vectors on the ordination, calculated with the envﬁt function
in the vegan package (Oksanen, 2007), represent the gradient
in each parameter (i.e., from lowest to highest concentration)
as well as the strength of the correlation between the environ-
mental parameter and the ordination (i.e., bacterial community
structure, as characterized by UniFrac distances). The vectors pro-
vide a graphical representation to identify relationships between
environmental gradients and patterns in bacterial community
structure.

DISCUSSION
Bacterial community structure at Site K is signiﬁcantly related
to well location, grain size, and chemical differences in ground-
water sediments, including percentage silt, and sediment C, Mn,
and Fe concentrations (Table 1). Taxa such as Alphaproteobac-
teria, Betaproteobacteria, and Acidobacteria were more abundant
at the village site (K240), in aquifer sediments with higher con-
centrations of sand and lower concentrations of C and metals. In
addition, the OTUs that were present only at well location K240
belonged to these taxa. By contrast, OTUs classiﬁed as Deltapro-
teobacteria and Chloroﬂexi comprised a larger proportion of the
communities in silty sediments with higher concentrations of C,
Fe, and Mn (Figure 4). These results suggest that the considerable
heterogeneity in sediment chemistry at Site K drives signiﬁcant
differences in bacterial community structure across the three well
locations.

The dominant members (greater than 5% of the community)
of the bacterial communities at Site K, Acidobacteria, Chloroﬂexi,
Firmicutes, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Deltapro-
teobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria (Figure 4), are abundant
in many soil and sediment environments. Recent 16S rRNA gene
sequence-based analyses have found that Acidobacteria and Pro-
teobacteria are the dominant members of soil bacterial commu-
nities across ecosystem types (Fierer et al., 2009). A global survey
of 21 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries found that while Pro-
teobacteria and Acidobacteria comprised roughly 40 and 20%
of the bacterial communities respectively, Chloroﬂexi and Fir-
micutes were also relatively abundant (greater than 5% of the
community), in a range of soil environments (Janssen, 2006).
Recent research shows that although these groups are domi-
nant across soil types, the relative proportion of the bacterial
community that each of these dominant groups comprises is
inﬂuenced by factors such as pH, depth within the soil proﬁle,
the degree of soil saturation, and anaerobiosis (Hansel et al.,
2008; Fierer et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2009). In our study, we
found that shifts in bacterial community structure were related
to changes in the sediment grain size distribution and changes
in sediment C, Mn, and Fe rather than soil moisture or depth
(Table 1).

Our ﬁnding that bacterial community structure is signiﬁcantly
related to sediment grain size is supported by other research

that has shown that sediment grain size inﬂuences microbial
biomass and bacterial community structure (Sessitsch et al., 2001),
and enzyme kinetics (Grandy et al., 2008). Silts typically have
higher concentrations of organic matter (Sparks, 2003), especially
aromatic carbon compounds and humic acids (Guggenberger
et al., 1995), and metals (Thorne and Nickless, 1981; Murray et al.,
1999). Sandy sediments, characterized by grain sizes larger than
150 μm, usually contain lower organic carbon and metal con-
centrations (Sparks, 2003). In the sandy sediments with high Si
concentrations at Site K, phyla such as Firmicutes and Alphapro-
teobacteria are the dominant groups in the bacterial community.
By contrast, Chloroﬂexi and Deltaproteobacteria were the domi-
nant members of the bacterial community in silty sediments with
high C and metal concentrations. Heavy metal concentrations have
been shown to correlate with bacterial community structure and
function in both soil and groundwater environments (Stefanowicz
et al., 2008).

Deltaproteobacteria are abundant across different soil and sed-
iment environments (Spain et al., 2009). There is evidence that
Deltaproteobacteria are more abundant in anaerobic soils (Hansel
et al., 2008), perhaps because members of Deltaproteobacteria can
use a variety of electron acceptors. For example, organisms within
the Geobacteraceae family can use labile C to reduce Fe, Mn, and
HS (Lovley and Phillips, 1988; Lovley et al., 1996). There is ample
evidence that Fe-, Mn-, and HS-reducing Deltaproteobacteria are
prevalent in anaerobic freshwater sediments (Coates et al., 2002;
Lovley et al., 2004), and previous research has documented that
the relative abundance and diversity of members of Geobacter-
aceae corresponds to Fe and Mn concentrations in groundwater
environments (Luna et al., 2009).

Although the overall community composition was not found
to be correlated with sediment As (Table 1), it is important to note
that there is a poor relationship between sediment and groundwa-
ter As concentrations in this environment (Radloff et al., 2008).
However bacterial community structure is signiﬁcantly correlated
to sediment characteristics, such as percent silt, sediment C, and
sediment metal concentrations, which are related to groundwater
As concentrations (van Geen et al., 2006b). Thus, the relation-
ship between the proportion of Deltaproteobacteria in the bac-
terial community and percent silt and concentrations of C and
Fe in the aquifer sediment may have important implications for
understanding how the native microbial community inﬂuences
groundwater As mobility at Site K. Fe-reducing Deltaproteobac-
teria could promote the mobilization of As by mediating the
reductive dissolution of Fe-oxides, which results in the desorption
of As from the Fe-oxide surface (McArthur et al., 2001; Jiang et al.,
2009). In fact, results from GBD sediment microcosm experiments
demonstrated that labile carbon additions promoted higher rates
of Fe(III)-reduction and As mobilization, as well as increases in
the relative abundance of Deltaproteobacteria (Islam et al., 2004).
Additional evidence from sediment microcosm experiments sug-
gests that microbial Fe-reduction is enhanced by the presence
of redox-active HS in aquifer sediments, which can shuttle elec-
trons to Fe(III), promoting Fe-oxide reduction and As desorp-
tion (Mladenov et al., 2010). Thus, Fe-reducing and HS-reducing
Deltaproteobacteria could play a signiﬁcant role in groundwater
As mobilization.

High arsenic aquifer bacterial communities

Deltaproteobacteria could also inﬂuence groundwater As
mobilization more directly. First, as mentioned above, although
the overall community composition was not related to sedi-
ment As, it was correlated to the percent silt in the sediment.
Fine-grained silts are less permeable than sands and often have
higher dissolved As concentrations. Thus Deltaproteobacteria in
the silty sediments at Site K may be more adapted to high ground-
water As concentrations. Members of Deltaproteobacteria genera
Desulfovibrio (Li and Krumholz, 2007), Desulfomicrobium (Macy
et al., 2000), and Geobacter (Methe et al., 2003) are known to
reduce As(V) to As(III) through a detoxiﬁcation pathway encoded
by the ars operon (Rosen et al., 1991). Groundwater As concen-
trations at Site K are highest at well K60 between 7 and 15 m,
and as a result these conditions may favor bacteria that can detox-
ify As. Thus, the potential for Deltaproteobacteria to mediate the
As detoxiﬁcation, Fe-reduction, Mn-reduction and HS-reduction
pathways could explain their higher abundance at K60 (Figure 4).
Chloroﬂexi at Site K are also signiﬁcantly more abundant in
silty sediments with higher concentrations of sediment C, Fe,
and Mn. Approximately 50% of the Chloroﬂexi OTUs at Site K
belonged to the halorespiring Dehalococcoidetes class, and these
OTUs were only present in the C- and metal-rich silty sediments
at well K60. Halorespiring Chloroﬂexi have also been discovered
in other pristine freshwater environments (Lofﬂer et al., 2000),
and recent research suggests that halorespiring bacteria could
also use other respiratory pathways including Se(VI)- reduction,
As(V)-reduction, Fe(III)-reduction, Mn(IV)-reduction, as well as
the oxidation and reduction of a model compound for quinone-
containing HS (Luijten et al., 2004). Also, two members of the
Dehalococcoides genus have the As resistance gene, arsC, within
their genome (Kube et al., 2005; Seshadri et al., 2005). Conse-
quently, Chloroﬂexi may have an advantage at well K60 over other
bacteria that do not have such adaptations to the local groundwater
geochemical conditions.

Based on the phylogenetic afﬁliations of these taxa, it is pos-
sible that these results indicate a shift to more Fe-, Mn-, and
humic substance-reducers in the silts with high C and metal
concentrations (Lovley and Phillips, 1988; Lovley et al., 1996;
Luijten et al., 2004). However, research is needed to further

elucidate the speciﬁc roles of taxa such as Deltaproteobacteria and
Chloroﬂexi in the groundwater environment at Site K. For exam-
ple, our study suggests that sediment C is important in structuring
bacterial communities and thus, further work on the source and
chemical characteristics of the sediment C may provide insight
into the dominant processes underlying the relationship between
C and bacterial community composition. For example, if the C is
serving largely as a nutrient source, we may conclude that observed
community shifts are an example of the copiotrophic–oligotrophic
continuum described by Fierer et al. (2007). By contrast, more
recalcitrant, redox-active C sources such as HS may be impor-
tant for electron shuttling that promotes Fe-reduction and As
mobilization (Mladenov et al., 2010).

CONCLUSION
Results from this research have led to a more complete under-
standing of the bacterial community structure within GBD aquifer
sediments. It is well-documented that sediment grain size, C, Mn,
and Fe inﬂuence the mobility of groundwater arsenic, and it is
intriguing that these constituents also structure the bacterial com-
munity. This work has also demonstrated the importance of deeper
16S rRNA gene sequencing in identifying environmentally relevant
patterns in bacterial community structure across groundwater As
gradients.

The UniFrac distances were calculated two different OTU-clustering methods (uclust and cd-hit), and for four different OTU identity thresholds (90, 95, 97, and 99%)
for the cd-hit method. In addition, UniFrac distances were calculated for rariﬁed datasets within each cluster method and identity threshold (i.e., 100 sequences from
the each sample for cd-hit at 97%). In the table the r statistics are listed, followed by the p-value.
p-values which are underlined are less than or equal to 0.05.

FIGURE A1 | Collector’s curves for the Chao1 richness estimator and
Shannon diversity index for two different OTU-picking methods. These

curves show that the alpha diversity of a majority of the samples approaches
an asymptote, and there is a wide range in the alpha diversity of the samples.
