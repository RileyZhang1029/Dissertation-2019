Since ancient times, even in today’s modern world, infectious diseases cause lots of
people to die. Infectious organisms, pathogens, cause diseases by physical interactions
with human proteins. A thorough analysis of these interspecies interactions is required
to provide insights about infection strategies of pathogens. Here we analyzed the most
comprehensive available pathogen–human protein interaction data including 23,435 inter-
actions, targeting 5,210 human proteins.The data were obtained from the newly developed
pathogen–host interaction search tool, PHISTO. This is the ﬁrst comprehensive attempt to
get a comparison between bacterial and viral infections. We investigated human proteins
that are targeted by bacteria and viruses to provide an overview of common and spe-
cial infection strategies used by these pathogen types. We observed that in the human
protein interaction network the proteins targeted by pathogens have higher connectivity
and betweenness centrality values than those proteins not interacting with pathogens.
The preference of interacting with hub and bottleneck proteins is found to be a common
infection strategy of all types of pathogens to manipulate essential mechanisms in human.
Compared to bacteria, viruses tend to interact with human proteins of much higher connec-
tivity and centrality values in the human network. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of
the human proteins targeted by pathogens indicates crucial clues about the infection mech-
anisms of bacteria and viruses. As the main infection strategy, bacteria interact with human
proteins that function in immune response to disrupt human defense mechanisms. Indis-
pensable viral strategy, on the other hand, is the manipulation of human cellular processes
in order to use that transcriptional machinery for their own genetic material transcription.
A novel observation about pathogen–human systems is that the human proteins targeted
by both pathogens are enriched in the regulation of metabolic processes.

INTRODUCTION
According to a report of World Health Organization (WHO), more
than 20% of total deaths in the world are due to infectious diseases
(World Health Organization, 2008). Different types of microor-
ganisms (bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses) act as pathogens
for such diseases. The mechanism of infection is based on the
interactions between the proteins of pathogen and host. Thanks to
the developments in high-throughput protein interaction detec-
tion methods, it is possible to identify pathogen–host protein–
protein interactions (PHIs) at large-scale. Infection strategies have
been studied through intraspecies protein interactions of various
pathogens (Flajolet et al., 2000; McCraith et al., 2000; Rain et al.,
2001; LaCount et al., 2005; Uetz et al., 2006; Calderwood et al.,
2007; Wang et al., 2010) as well as through interspecies protein
interactions between pathogens and human (Filippova et al., 2004;
Mogensen et al., 2006; Uetz et al., 2006; Calderwood et al., 2007;
König et al., 2008). Notwithstanding these, a general overview of
infection mechanisms of different types of pathogens is missing
since there has been a lack of interspecies interactome data until
very recent years.

A major step toward a complete picture of the pathogenesis
of infectious diseases and consequently identifying drug targets
is the cataloging of large-scale PHIs. There are few PHI-speciﬁc
databases, which enable the access to PHI data for each type
of pathogen from a single source (Driscoll et al., 2009; Kumar
and Nanduri, 2010). Nevertheless these databases have not been
updated since their ﬁrst release, and miss lots of recently reported
PHIs. Therefore, we have recently developed a pathogen–host
interaction search tool (PHISTO), which serves as a centralized
and up-to-date source for the entire available PHI data between
various pathogen strains and human via a user-friendly and
functional interface1.

The systemic analysis of PHI data has so far focused mainly on
virus-based infections due to the scarcity of data for other types of
pathogenic organisms (Uetz et al., 2006; Calderwood et al., 2007;
Dyer et al., 2008). We have enough bacterial PHIs to get statis-
tically meaningful results, providing a good opportunity to get a

systemic picture of the pathogenesis of bacterial infections. In this
work, we studied up-to-date PHI data reported in PHISTO with a
speciﬁc focus on comparison between bacterial and viral infections
of human. We constructed various sets of human proteins targeted
by bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses to pick out speciﬁc infec-
tion strategies of different pathogen types. On the other hand, the
set of human proteins targeted by both bacteria and viruses were
used to obtain common infection strategies of these pathogens.
We computed degree (connectivity) and betweenness centrality
distributions of the human protein sets targeted by bacteria and
viruses to observe the network properties of targeted human pro-
teins. Additionally, we computed gene ontology (GO; Ashburner
et al., 2000) terms enriched in each above-mentioned protein set to
ﬁnd out attacked mechanisms in human. GO enrichment analysis
was also performed for sets of human proteins targeted by each
pathogen group included in our PHI data to decipher the pathogen
group(s) manipulating speciﬁc processes in human.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
PATHOGEN–HOST INTERACTION SEARCH TOOL
We have developed PHISTO that presents experimentally veriﬁed
pathogen–human protein interaction data in the most compre-
hensive and updated manner. The database provides the entirety
of relevant information about the physical PHIs in a single non-
redundant resource to researchers. It offers access via a user-
friendly and functional web interface (see text footnote 1) with
various searching, ﬁltering, browsing, and extraction options.
Results are displayed in a very clear and consistent presentation
format. PHISTO enables the users to reach additional information
easily by providing links in the search results to external databases.
Proteins, pathogens, and publications listed in the search results
are linked to UniProt, NCBI Taxonomy, and PubMed, respectively,
offering users quick navigation in these informative databases.

We downloaded the pathogen–human PHIs from PHISTO in
October 2011. The data cover 23,435 physical interactions occur-
ring between 5,210 human proteins and 3,419 proteins of 257
pathogen strains of 72 pathogen groups (24 bacterial groups, 3
fungal groups, 2 protozoan groups, and 43 viral groups; Table 1).
In PHISTO, pathogen strains are grouped to provide an option to
present PHI results together for related strains. Bacterial groups
are sets of strains of the same genus as the names of the groups
are the names of the genuses. For viral groups, there are two
deﬁnitions. Some viral groups are sets of strains of the same fam-
ily as the names of the groups are the names coming from the
families of the strains (e.g., papillomaviruses, herpesviruses, poly-
omaviruses). Some viral strains are grouped based on the related
infections caused by them, as the names are generally coming
from the diseases (e.g., HIV, hepatitis viruses, anemia viruses).
Detailed PHI data for 72 groups are given in Data Sheets 1–4 in
Supplementary Material.

HUMAN PPI DATA
To obtain degree and betweenness centrality values of pathogen-
targeted proteins, the human protein–protein interaction (PPI)
network was constructed by downloading 194,006 interactions
between 13,015 human proteins from BioGRID (Stark et al., 2011),
DIP (Salwinski et al., 2004), IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2012), Mint

(Ceol et al., 2010), and Reactome (Matthews et al., 2009; Croft
et al., 2011) in April 2011.

HUMAN PROTEIN SETS
A total of 10 sets of human proteins interacting with pathogens
were constructed from PHI data to analyze the properties of
targeted human proteins as follows: The sets targeted by bacte-
rial pathogens (bacteria-targeted set), fungal pathogens (fungi-
targeted set), protozoan pathogens (protozoa-targeted set), and
viral pathogens (virus-targeted set) were analyzed for speciﬁc
infection strategies of these different pathogen types. For a deeper
comparison between bacterial and viral infections, human pro-
teins interacting with at least two bacterial groups (two-bacteria-
targeted set) and two viral groups (two-viruses-targeted set)
and also human proteins interacting with at least three bacte-
rial groups (three-bacteria-targeted set) and three viral groups
(three-viruses-targeted set) were used. To obtain common infec-
tion strategies of pathogens, sets of human proteins targeted by
all types of pathogens (pathogen-targeted set) and by both bac-
teria and viruses (bacteria–virus-targeted set) were also analyzed.
Finally, 72 sets of human proteins each targeted by a pathogen
group reported in Table 1 were additionally used in GO enrich-
ment analysis to investigate the human mechanisms attacked by
each pathogen group in the PHI data. Totally, 82 human protein
sets were constructed and analyzed.

DEGREE AND BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY CALCULATIONS
Degree of a protein within a network is deﬁned as its number
of connections. Betweenness centrality of a protein is equal to
the number of shortest paths between any pairs passing through
that protein. The degree and centrality values of proteins in inter-
action networks provide valuable information about the role of
corresponding proteins in the network’s functional organization
using the topology of the interconnections. For instance, hubs
(highly connected proteins) and bottlenecks (central proteins to
many paths in the network) are critical players in the intraspecies
protein networks for information ﬂow (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004;
Yu et al., 2007).

The undirected human PPI network was represented as an
adjacency matrix, and the degree and centrality values of each
protein in the network were calculated in MATLAB environment.
Betweenness centrality calculations were performed by freely avail-
able MATLAB BGL package developed by David Gleich2. The
results were normalized by (n − 1)(n − 2), where n is the num-
ber of all proteins in the PPI network. Self-interactions were not
taken into account in these calculations.

GO ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS
Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) enrichments of all 82
human protein sets were performed using BiNGO plugin (ver.
2.44) of Cytoscape (ver. 2.8.1; Maere et al., 2005). Signiﬁcance
level was set to 0.05 meaning that only terms enriched with a
p-value of at most 0.05 were considered. All three GO terms (bio-
logical process, molecular function, and cellular component) were

RESULTS
PATHOGEN-TARGETED HUMAN PROTEINS
The distribution of 5,210 human proteins on their targeting
pathogens are shown in the Venn diagram (Figure 1). Detailed
properties of all pathogen-targeted human proteins including
number and types of targeting pathogens together with degree
and betweenness centrality values in the human PPI network
are given in Data Sheet 5 in Supplementary Material. The most
targeted human proteins are listed in Table 2. The top of this
list, P53 (Tumor suppressor), DRA (HLA class II histocompati-
bility antigen, DR alpha chain), SUMO1 (Small ubiquitin-related
modiﬁer 1), JUN (Transcription factor AP-1), NPM (Nucleophos-
min), ROA1 (Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1), and
UBC9 (SUMO-conjugating enzyme) and the following proteins
have potential to give important insights about infections.

DEGREE AND CENTRALITY DISTRIBUTIONS
Figure 2 displays the comparison between the degree distributions
of non-targeted proteins in the human PPI network and bacteria
and virus-targeted sets. For both cases of bacteria and virus-
targeted sets, it is observed that pathogen-targeted human proteins
have generally higher degree values than non-targeted ones. How-
ever a difference is observed in trends of degree distributions of

The targeting pathogenic proteins for each human protein can be obtained from Data Sheets 1–4 in Supplementary Material.

to justify these global trends, the same analyses was then repeated
with human protein sets excluding the overrepresented pathogens,
i.e., Bacillus, Yersinia, and HIV which target the largest number of
human proteins (Table 1). Similar results are still obtained when
major pathogen groups are eliminated (Figure 4).

GO ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS
All enriched GO terms for each human protein set are avail-
able in Data Sheets 6–10 in Supplementary Material for fur-
ther detailed analyses. Special attention should be paid to the
results of sets of human proteins interacting with three and
more bacterial groups and three and more viral groups for a
comparison between their infection strategies. The human pro-
teins targeted by more pathogen groups reﬂect more speciﬁcity
to infection mechanism of the corresponding pathogen (bac-
teria or virus). The enriched GO terms in human proteins

interacting with both bacterial and viral pathogens are also impor-
tant to highlight common infection mechanisms. The ﬁrst 20
enriched GO process terms for three-bacteria-targeted-set, three-
viruses-targeted-set, and bacteria–virus-targeted set are listed in
Tables 3–5 to point out the human processes that are attacked by
pathogens.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we aim to provide a general overview of infection
strategies used by different pathogens based on the comprehensive
PHI data in PHISTO. Although large-scale pathogen–human pro-
tein interaction data have been identiﬁed in the last few years, the
data for fungal and protozoan systems are still scarce (Table 1) to
extract signiﬁcant conclusions about their infection mechanisms.
On the other hand, interspecies protein interaction networks for
bacterial and viral pathogens with human have been identiﬁed,

enough to provide some insights about their strategies to subvert
human cellular processes during infection.

With increasing PHI data of bacterial and viral pathogens, stud-
ies have been performed to enlighten speciﬁc bacteria–human
(Mogensen et al., 2006; Dyer et al., 2010) and virus–human
(Filippova et al., 2004; Uetz et al., 2006; Calderwood et al.,
2007; König et al., 2008) interaction systems. Although some
studies provided global views of infection strategies of viruses
(Dyer et al., 2008) and bacteria (Dyer et al., 2010) separately,
they do not provide a direct comparison between bacterial and

viral infections. In fact, only <2% of the PHI data of Dyer
et al. (2008) are for bacteria–human interactions whereas it
is more than 36% in our database of PHISTO. Hence, our
study constitutes the ﬁrst extensive comparison between bacteria–
human and virus–human interspecies protein interaction net-
works to retrieve information about infection strategies speciﬁc
to each system and then common to both systems. Our ﬁndings
should be interpreted with caution since the protein interac-
tion networks between pathogens and human are not complete
yet.

SPECIAL INFECTION STRATEGIES
In recent studies it has been suggested that viral proteins (Calder-
wood et al., 2007; Dyer et al., 2008; Itzhaki, 2011) and bacterial
proteins (Dyer et al., 2010) have evolved to preferentially inter-
act with hubs and bottlenecks in the human PPI network. The
degree and betweenness centrality distributions of the bacteria-
targeted and virus-targeted human protein sets are displayed in
comparison with non-targeted proteins in the human PPI net-
work in Figures 2 and 3. We observe that the degree and centrality
values of human proteins increase with increasing number of tar-
geting bacterial and viral groups, conﬁrming the previous results
with the most comprehensive PHI data. A novel ﬁnding by our
comparative analysis is that the increase in degree and centrality
values with increasing number of pathogen groups is much more
pronounced in virus-targeted cases than bacteria-targeted cases
(Figures 2 and 3). Therefore we can conclude that attacking to
hub and bottleneck proteins in the human interaction network is
more speciﬁc to viral infections.

In our PHI data, some pathogen groups are overrepresented
with their larger number of reported interactions with human
(Table 1). As most of these large-scale data have been produced
with high-throughput detection methods, which are prone to
experimental biases and errors, it was necessary to check whether
the distributions of degree and centrality values of the pathogen-
targeted human proteins would be same without the groups with
large number of interacting partners of human proteins (i.e., Bacil-
lus,Yersinia, and HIV). Hence, we performed the above-mentioned
analyses with human protein sets excluding these major pathogen
groups. 1,199 human proteins targeted by only Yersinia strains
were excluded from the bacteria-targeted set, and 1,283 human
proteins targeted by only HIV strains were excluded from the
virus-targeted set to obtain the degree and betweenness central-
ity values of the remaining human proteins. We also analyzed
the human proteins targeted by bacteria other than Bacillus and

Yersinia to exclude the effect of large-scale data of the two. 1,199
only Yersinia-targeted and 847 only Bacillus-targeted human pro-
teins were excluded from the bacteria-targeted set. The behavior of
the remaining human proteins can be observed in Figure 4 result-
ing in similar trends with the global case. Additionally, a direct
comparison of the degree and centrality between bacteria and
virus-targeted interaction partners with respect to non-targeted
human proteins is also given in Figure 4. The difference in the
behavior of the bacteria- and virus-targeted sets are clear espe-
cially in degree distributions (Figure 4A). The degree values of
bacteria-targeted human proteins with or without Bacillus and
Yersinia are nearly same. On the other hand, attack of viruses to
more connected human proteins is more clear when HIV data are
excluded.

From the enriched GO process terms in human proteins tar-
geted by at least three bacterial groups (Table 3), we can conclude
that bacteria may have adapted to attack proteins involved gener-
ally in human immunity pathways. Therefore, the most speciﬁc
bacterial infection strategy is through evading or suppressing
human immune responses as also concluded previously (Lai et al.,
2001; Park et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2005; Dyer et al., 2010).
The human immune system is manipulated by bacterial pro-
teins attacking human proteins functioning in innate and adaptive
immunity (i.e., TLR4 and TLR7), inﬂammation (i.e., NF-κB and
BCL6), and activation of T cells (i.e., CXCR4 and LCK; Zhang and
Ghosh, 2000; Alonso et al., 2004; Oda and Kitano, 2006; Dyer et al.,
2010). In our PHI data it is observed that Yersinia bacteria attack all
these human defense mechanisms targeting all mentioned human
proteins. Proteins of Bacillus and Francisella interact with NF-κB
and LCK (Dyer et al., 2010) aiming to disrupt the mechanisms of
inﬂammation and T cell responses. On the other hand, proteins of
Chlamydia, Escherichia, and Neisseria interact with crucial players
of innate and adaptive immunity, toll-like receptors (TLR4 and
TLR7; Croft et al., 2011) to collapse the human immune system.

There are several other bacteria-targeted human proteins involved
in the immune system. Their interactions with bacterial proteins
should be investigated carefully for a complete understanding of
bacterial strategies targeting human defense mechanism during
infection.

Viruses attack human cellular processes (Table 4) enabling
themselves to proliferate in human during infection. All viruses use
this mechanism since they need host’s transcriptional machinery
for viral genetic material transcription. Even the human proteins
targeted by only one viral group are enriched in GO process
terms relevant to regulation of cellular mechanisms (Data Sheet 10
in Supplementary Material). Viruses manipulate human cellular
mechanisms by interacting with various proteins functioning in
cell cycle (i.e., DLG1, PTMA, and EP300), with human transcrip-
tion factors to promote their own genetic material transcription
(i.e., E2F1 and TAF1), with key proteins controlling apoptosis

their genetic material across the nuclear membrane (i.e., RAN, and
SUMO1; Lechner and Laimins, 1994; Thompson et al., 1997; Car-
rillo et al., 2004; Thomas et al., 2005; Dyer et al., 2008). In our PHI
data, Adenoviruses, HIV, Papillomaviruses, and Polyomaviruses
are observed to target one or more proteins in each of four groups;
cell cycle proteins, transcription factors, apoptosis regulator, and
nuclear membrane proteins. Proteins of Hepatitis viruses interact
with PTMA, EP300, TAF1, and p53 while proteins of Herpesviruses
interact with PTMA and SUMO1. On the other hand, viral groups
of Inﬂuenza, Puumala, Tula, SARS, and Vaccinia are observed
to target nuclear membrane proteins. The other virus-targeted
human proteins involved in cellular mechanisms should be inves-
tigated comprehensively for a complete understanding of viral
strategies targeting human cellular mechanism.

We can conclude that the main infection strategies of bacteria
and viruses are through attacking human immune system and cel-
lular processes, respectively. However, there are some exceptions
such that some bacterial groups target human proteins functioning
in cellular mechanisms whereas some viral groups target human
proteins functioning in defense mechanisms. In the case of bacte-
ria, the difference might arise from the life-style, e.g., intracellular
bacteria like Chlamydia, Listeria, and Mycoplasma are able to grow
and reproduce only within the host cells just like viruses (Kauf-
mann, 1993). Therefore, human protein sets targeted by these
intracellular bacterial groups are enriched in GO process terms
related to the cellular mechanisms (e.g., regulation of cellular

processes, regulation of transcription) in addition to the immune
sytem (Data Sheet 6 in Supplementary Material). On the other
hand, viruses like herpes and pox (ectromelia, molluscum, orf,
vaccinia) viruses as well as HIV have the ability to evade human
immune system (Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000) as observed in
our results (Data Sheet 9 in Supplementary Material).

For more speciﬁc infection strategies of pathogen groups, the
results of GO enrichment analysis for the human protein sets tar-
geted by each of the 72 groups in the PHI data can be used (Data
Sheets 6–9 in Supplementary Material). Additionally, intranet-
works of pathogenic proteins in each pathogen group should be
analyzed for drug target identiﬁcation after a thorough under-
standing of pathogenesis via interspecies protein interactions.

COMMON INFECTION STRATEGIES
In spite of the difference in the trends of distributions of degree
and centrality values of human proteins in bacteria-targeted and
virus-targeted sets, the tendency to attack human proteins that
are highly connected (hubs) and central to shortest paths (bot-
tlenecks) is common to all types of pathogens. We observed in
our PHI data that the degree and centrality values of pathogen-
targeted human proteins are generally greater than non-targeted
ones. This infection strategy of pathogens, attacking more con-
nected and central nodes in the human PPI network, is probably
due to enabling themselves to control and disrupt essential com-
plexes and pathways more easily. With scale-free nature, the human
PPI network is robust to attacks on random nodes. However, the
selective attacks to even a small number of nodes of high degree can

dramatically change the topology and functionality of the network
(Albert et al., 2000; Li et al., 2006).

Although bacteria and viruses have a tendency to interact with
different human proteins (Figure 1), they together target those
(779 human proteins) enriched in the regulation of metabolic
processes in addition to cellular processes (Table 5). For instance,
a pyruvate kinase isozyme, KPYM, functions in glycolysis catalyz-
ing the transfer of a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP) to ADP, generating ATP. This metabolic human protein
is targeted by three bacterial (Bacillus, Francisella, and Yersinia)
and three viral groups (Hepatitis, Herpesviruses, and Papillo-
maviruses) in the PHI data. Alpha-enolase is another bacteria–
virus-targeted enzyme which functions in glycolysis, just before
KPYM enzyme, converting 2-phospho-glycerate to PEP. A meta-
bolic step operating again around lower glycolysis is the produc-
tion of lactate from pyruvate. Both isoenzymes (LDHA, LDHB)
are found to be a target for bacterial and viral groups. In addition
to lower glycolysis, some enzymes functioning in lipid metabo-
lism (ACSA, ACOT9, CPT1A) were identiﬁed as common targets
of bacteria and viruses. Interestingly, two enzymes functioning
for protection against oxidative-stress are in our common-target
list: catalase (CATA) and glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3). These
enzymes remove H2O2, which is a reactive oxygen species (ROS)
harmful for the cell.

To our knowledge, the human proteins targeted by both bacte-
ria and viruses have not been investigated in any previous study.
Through our analyses using large-scale PHI data we can conclude
that both bacteria and viruses attack to the proteins functioning
in human metabolic processes as a common infection strategy. All
bacteria–viruses-targeted human proteins involved in metabolic
processes should be investigated carefully for a complete picture
of commonalities in bacterial and viral infections.
