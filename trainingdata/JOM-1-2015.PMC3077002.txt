Background: Population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated
with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the
human oral commensal microbiota.
Design: In this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (rodA), which is
associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the
diversity of the rodA gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. Moreover, we
developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method based on the diversity
of the rodA gene (rodA-DGGE) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely,
Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus
gordonii, Streptococcus vestibularis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus
sobrinus.
Results: This rodA-DGGE method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation,
isolation, and phenotypic characterization.
Conclusion: Analysis of the oral microbiota by rodA-DGGE offers a higher resolution than the conventional
DGGE using 16S rDNA and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)

analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) is
used for investigating entire bacterial commu-
nities without cultivation (1). The advantage of this
method is that it uses 16S rDNA, which is present in
all bacteria and can be amplified with a set of universal
bacterial primers. Bacterial species are differentiated on
the basis of differential migration on a denaturing
gradient gel due to their melting behavior, which is based
on the difference in the GC content. A bar code-like
profile is obtained, with each band presumably represent-
ing a different microorganism within the microbial

communities (13). This molecular technique has become
an important tool for studying complex bacterial com-
munities and has been applied for the analyses of various
microbiotas, such as those found in environmental
biofilms, food fermentation processes, feces,
intestine,
gastrointestinal tract infections, corneal ulcer, and vagi-
nosis (410).

DGGE analysis using 16S rDNA (16S rDNA-DGGE)
has also been applied for analyzing the microflora found
in the periodontal pocket, dental plaque, and saliva in
order to identify the pathogens causing periodontitis,
dental caries, and halitosis (1114). These reports indicate

that the pathogenic bacteria of oral diseases, such as
Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetem-
comitans, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nuclea-
tum, and Streptococcus mutans, are clearly detected by
16S rDNA-DGGE. However, viridans
streptococci,
which are closely associated with bacteremia and sub-
acute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), have not been clearly
detected. One of the reasons is that the 16S rDNA genes
of several viridans streptococci are highly homologous
and that there is evidence of homologous recombination
between species (15). The 16S rDNA genes of Strepto-
coccus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus
pneumoniae,
in particular, exhibit more than 99% se-
quence homology with each other (16). Therefore, it is
difficult to clearly identify these species by 16S rDNA-
DGGE as this method is based on differences in the G
C content. Hence, our hypothesis was that some other
gene, the evolutionary rate of which is higher than that of
16S rDNA, would be a useful target for DGGE analysis
aiming at detecting the abovementioned streptococci.

Previously, during the sequencing of the glucosyltrans-
ferase gene (gtfR) of S. oralis (17), we found three open
reading frames upstream of gtfR. By using the basic local
alignment search tool, one of them was identified as the
rod shape-determining protein (RodA) gene (rodA),
which is widely present in gram-positive and gram-
negative bacteria. This gene determines cellular morphol-
ogy and is associated with peptidoglycan degradation
during elongation and septation (18). In addition, since it
has been suggested that rodA of Streptococcus thermo-
philus is associated with oxidative stress defense and
streptonigrin tolerance (19, 20), it becomes one of the
interesting genes in the study of bacterial response against
environmental stress. Our preliminary alignment analysis
revealed 78% similarity of rodA of S. oralis to that of
S. mitis; further, this similarity was lower than that
between 16S rDNA of S. oralis and that of S. mitis. Thus,
we thought that the streptococcal rodA gene would
exhibit sufficient phylogenetic diversity to aid in identify-
ing viridans streptococci by DGGE.

streptococci, and phylogenetically
analyzed them as the identification tool of those species.
In addition, we developed a DGGE method based on the
phylogenetic diversity of the rodA gene for detecting
dominant streptococci in human oral cavity.

Methods

Sampling of streptococcal strains in saliva
The study group comprised eight healthy adult volun-
teers. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics
Board of the Institute of Dentistry, Nagasaki University,
and informed consent was obtained from all the subjects.
Non-stimulated saliva was used as the clinical sample in

this study, since it roughly represents a summary of the
oral microbiota of the teeth, tongue, and mucosa of the
upper respiratory tract. These samples were obtained by
collecting whole saliva in a sterile tube before tooth
brushing. The samples were serially diluted and inocu-
lated on mitis-salivarius (MS) agar (Difco Laboratories,
Detroit, MI). From the inoculated MS agar plates, 20
colonies were randomly selected and streptococcal strains
in saliva were isolated. These clinical
isolates were
identified by a combination of phenotypic characteriza-
tion performed using STREPTOGRAM (Wako Pure
Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) (21), polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) based on the species-specific variety of gtf
genes (22), and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (16)
and were examined for the rodA sequence according to
the following method.

Bacterial strains and culture
The reference strains used in this study were taken from
our own culture collection (Table 1) (21, 23). These were
selected as the streptococcal species that could be
detected in the oral cavity. The strains designated
ATCC, NCTC, CCUG, and GTC were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection, National Collec-
tion of Type Cultures (Colindale, London, England),
Culture Collection of the University of GoÂ¨ teborg (GoÂ¨ -
teborg, Sweden), and Gifu Type Culture Collection
(Gifu, Japan), respectively. These organisms were routi-
nely cultured in brain heart infusion broth (BHI; Difco
Laboratories) and on 5% defibrinated sheep blood agar
(Nissui Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).

Preparation of DNA for PCR
DNA of the cultured bacteria was obtained as previously
described (17). In brief, the organisms were grown in BHI
broth at 378C for 18 h, collected, and then washed by
centrifugation. The cells were suspended in a solution of
50 mM NaCl and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and then
digested with mutanolysin (final concentration, 33.3 U
mL1; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) at 508C for 1
h. Thereafter, the cells were lysed by adding N-lauroyl
sarcosine (final concentration, 1.5%) and Ethylenediamin
etetraacetic acid (EDTA) (final concentration, 10 mM).
The lysate was treated with RNase (0.3 mg mL1; Wako
Pure Chemicals) and proteinase K (0.3 mg mL1; Sigma-
Aldrich Co.). DNA was purified from the cell lysate by
phenol, phenol-chloroform, and chloroform extractions
and collected by ethanol precipitation.

Further, the bacterial DNA from the saliva samples
was extracted as previously described (22). In brief, the
organisms in the saliva were harvested from 500 mL of the
samples by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min. The
bacterial cells were heated in a microwave oven at 500 W
for 5 min to destroy the cell walls and then digested in 100
mL of 200 U mL1 mutanolysin (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) at

tree was constructed by using the neighbor-joining
algorithm with MEGA 4 (25) on the basis of nucleotide
sequences by using the maximum composite likelihood
model. The corresponding parameter of the neighbor-
joining algorithm was set as âcomplete deletion.â

Phylogenetic analysis of the known rodA sequences
To evaluate the appropriateness of
the phylogenetic
reconstruction based on rodA genes and to design the
primers used in this study, relevant, available gene
sequences of rodA and 16S rDNA genes were obtained
from the GenBank database and analyzed. The phyloge-
netic distances were calculated with the abovementioned
algorithm and parameter using MEGA 4.

Design of PCR primers
The primers used in this study to amplify the fragments
of the rodA gene and to determine their sequence were
Rd_uni-F (5?-CCDTCAGARTTTATGAAGATWTCC-
3?) and Rd_uni-R (5?-AATCATATCHSWYTCDCG-
DACWGG-3?). Approximately 520-bp-long fragment of
the rodA gene was amplified with these primers. These
oligonucleotide primers were designed on the basis of
conserved sequences, which were identified by aligning
the streptococcal rodA genes in the GenBank nucleotide
database. The DGGE sample was amplified using
Rd_uni-F and a primer constructed by the addition of
the GC clamp (CGCCCGGGGCGCGCCCCGGGC
GGCCCGGGGGCACCGGGGG-) to Rd_uni-R.

PCR conditions
The rodA gene was amplified by performing PCR in 50 mL
of a reaction mixture containing 0.5-U Takara Ex TaqTM
Hot Start (HS) Version (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), 0.5 mM of
the
DNA
(B20 ng mL1), and 1.5 mM of MgCl2, according to
the manufacturerâs instructions. Amplification was per-
formed using GeneAmpâ  System 9700 (Applied Biosys-
tems, Foster City, CA), under the following conditions: 35
cycles of denaturation at 988C for 10 s, primer annealing
at 488C for 30 s, and extension at 728C for 30 s. The PCR
products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophor-
esis, after staining with ethidium bromide. The amplicons
were then purified with a Qiagen PCR purification kit
(QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and used as the
template for subsequent sequencing and amplification of
the DGGE sample. The DGGE samples were amplified
by PCR by changing the annealing temperature to 538C
and using the purified amplicons as the template.

DGGE analysis
In this study, the DGGE analyses were performed with
the DCodeTM universal mutation detection system (Bio-
Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), according to the
manufacturerâs instructions. The DGGE analysis was
initially performed with a perpendicular denaturing
gradient gel
in order to determine the conditions for
that with a parallel gradient gel. To determine the
streptococcal rodA genes having the highest and lowest
melting temperature (Tm) among nine dominant strepto-
coccal species
in the human oral cavity, S. mitis,
Streptococcus sanguinis, S. oralis, Streptococcus gordonii,
Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus
salivarius,
Streptococcus vestibularis, S. mutans, and Streptococcus
sobrinus (26, 27), the Tm values of the rodA amplicons
were calculated using the following formula: Tm
81.58C16.6 (log10[Na])0.41(%[GC])(500/n) (28).
The samples with genes having the highest and lowest
Tm values were applied on a perpendicular denatur-
ing gradient gel containing 6% of acrylamide and
070% linear gradient of denaturant (100% denaturant
was equivalent to 7 molÃL1 urea and 40% deinonized
formamide) and separated at 80 V for 2 h at 568C. On
the basis of the result obtained, the appropriate constant
denaturant concentration in the DGGE analysis to detect
the selected nine streptococcal species was manually
determined by changing it
into every 2% from the
dissociable denaturant concentration of
the lowest-
Tm rodA fragment to that of the highest-Tm fragment.
The electrophoresis patterns of nine streptococcal refer-
ence strains were adopted as the reference markers
to identify these species. In the constant denaturing
gel electrophoresis, a gel containing 8% (w/v) of acryl-
amide and 28% of denaturant was used, and electro-
phoresis was performed at 260 V for 6 h at 568C.
The electrophoresed gels were visualized by staining
with SYBRâ  Gold (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA).

Registration of sequences
The newly determined rodA sequences were deposited in
DDBJ. Their accession numbers are shown in Table 1.

Results

Phylogenetic analysis of reference rodA genes from
selected gram-positive bacteria and sequence
analysis of streptococcal rodA genes
At first, in order to investigate the prevalence of rodA gene
in Streptococcus spp., we performed phylogenetic analysis
of the sequences obtained from members of the genus
Streptococcus and related genera. We obtained 26 rodA
genes, derived from the members of the genera Strepto-
coccus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and
Listeria, from the GenBank database. The phylogenetic
tree of
these genes was constructed, with its root
representing the rodA gene of Listeria monocytogenes
(Fig. 1A). This tree clearly divides the tested strains at the
genus and species levels. Therefore, the streptococcal rodA
genes were considered to exhibit sufficient phylogenetic
diversity to classify the genus at the species level. More-
over, when the sequence similarities of rodA genes among
S. pneumoniae R6, S. mitis NCTC 12261, and S. oralis
ATCC 10557 were calculated, the similarity between S.
pneumoniae and S. mitis, S. pneumoniae and S. oralis, and
S. oralis and S. mitis was 93%, 77%, and 78%, respectively.
These similarity values were smaller than those of the 16S
rRNA genes among the three abovementioned strains.

Next, we performed the alignment analysis of the
streptococcal rodA gene sequences retrieved in order to
design the universal PCR primers that could amplify all
the streptococcal rodA genes. As a result, we constructed
the primers that could amplify approximately 520-bp-
long fragment from the N-terminus region of 1,200-bp-
total length of the rodA gene and the amplicons isolated
from 21 nonhemolytic streptococci were sequenced (Table
1). In the phylogenetic analysis, approximately 370-bp
sequence determined with fidelity was used.

Phylogenetic analysis of the streptococcal
rodA genes
The phylogenetic distances of the rodA (approximately
370 bp) and 16S rDNA (approximately 1,200 bp) genes
among streptococcal strains in Table 1 were computed
with MEGA 4 by using the following: bootstrap analyses
(500 replicates), gap/missing data (complete deletion),
model (maximum composite likelihood), and substitution
(d; transitiontransversion) (Table 2). The mean phylo-
genetic distance of
the rodA and 16S rDNA genes
was calculated and found to be 0.527 (SE, 0.474) and
0.043 (SE, 0.005), respectively. For this reason, the base

DGGE analysis of streptococcal rodA genes

Fig. 2. Negative image of the rodA-DGGE analyses. The appropriate denaturant concentration in the following experiment was
determined by the ethidium bromide-stained perpendicular DGGE gel. The rodA gene fragments of S. sobrinus (with highest
Tm) and S. mutans (with lowest Tm) were ampliï¬ed with the GC-clamped primer set. The amplicons were applied on the same
perpendicular denaturing gradient gel containing 6% of acrylamide and 070% linear gradient of denaturant and
electrophoresed at 80 V for 2 h at 568C. The electrophoretic bands of these two amplicons were separated at concentrations
of the denaturant ranging from 22 to 56% (A). The rodA-DGGE analysis with parallel constant denaturant gel was applied to
detection of viridans streptococci in saliva. In this experiment, a parallel constant denaturant gel containing 8% (w/v) of
acrylamide and 28% of constant denaturant was used, and the GC-clamped rodA gene fragments were separated at 260 V for 6 h
at 568C in 0.5 Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer. As the reference markers to identify the streptococcal species, the GC-clamped rodA
fragments of S. sobrinus (sob), S. sanguinis (san), S. oralis (ora), S. mitis (mit), S. vestibularis (ves), S. salivarius (sal), S.
parasanguinis (par), S. gordonii (gor), and S. mutans (mut) were used. The Arabic numerals identify the individual subjects (B).

substitution rates in the rodA genes were observed to be
considerably higher
than those in the 16S rDNA
sequences, though the phylogenetic distance between
the rodA genes of Streptococcus australis and Strepto-
coccus infantis was 0.00. The phylogenetic tree also
indicated that the evolutionary rates of the rodA genes,
except those of S. australis and S. infantis, were higher
than those of the 16S rDNA sequences (Fig. 1B and C).
Thus, it was revealed that the phylogenetic analysis based
on the rodA sequences of Streptococcus spp. except S.
australis and S. infantis, would be able to differentiate the
species that are closely related by 16S rDNA analysis.

Determination of the conditions for DGGE with
constant denaturing gradient gel
As for the nine dominant streptococcal species in the
human oral cavity, the GC content (%) and Tm value
(8C) were estimated from these sequence data in order to
determine the conditions for the subsequent DGGE
analysis. The rodA genes of S. sobrinus and S. mutans
showed the highest (49.78C) and lowest (37.68C) Tm
values, respectively. The fragments of the genes obtained
from these two strains, which were amplified with the GC-
clamped primer set, were applied to perpendicular dena-
turing gradient gel to determine the optimal concentration

of the denaturant (Fig. 2A). It was observed that these two
amplicons separated between 22% and 56% of
the
denaturant and that the double-strand rodA fragment of
S. mutans and S. sobrinus started to denature at 22% and
34% of the denaturant, respectively. Thus, the appropriate
constant denaturant concentration in the DGGE analysis
to detect the nine streptococcal species was fixed at 28%. In
this condition, the rodA fragments from the nine species
showed clearly different mobility (Fig. 2B) in order of the
estimated Tm value except S. sanguinis and S. mitis (data
not shown).

Detection of nine Streptococcus species by DGGE
analysis based on the diversity of the rodA gene
As shown in Fig. 2B, the electrophoresis patterns of the
rodA gene fragments of
samples were
compared with those of nine reference streptococcal
strains, and the streptococci present in the saliva samples
were expected (Table 3). Then, we extracted the DNA
fragments from the band on the DGGE gel in Fig. 2B
and carried out direct sequence. The sequence of the
streptococci asterisked in Table 3 were consistent with the
rodA sequence of the corresponding bacterial species
isolated from MS agar, although the fragments extracted
from thin bands in lanes 2, 3, and 4 could not be
sequenced. On the other hand, all species listed in Table 3
were contained in the sample of streptococci isolated
from MS agar plate cultures. Thus, it was revealed that
the rodA-DGGE analysis could detect the streptococcal
species as well as the cultivation method.

Discussion
RodA is the molecule that participates with penicillin-
binding protein 2 in peptidoglycan synthesis and cell
division (29). Peptidoglycan synthesis by these two
molecules has been investigated in association with
susceptibility to antibiotics such as penicillin (30), and
many studies on this subject have been reported not only

as S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci
Therefore, it is important that peptidoglycan synthesis
and cell division by RodA and penicillin-binding protein
2 is studied in these streptococci in the future. Further, it
is thought that phylogenetic analysis of the streptococcal
rodA gene, which is one of the genes associated with the
abovementioned biological activities, is more important
as the initial step in the investigation of the mechanism
underlying drug resistance in streptococcal
infection.
However, until now, there is no report on the phyloge-
netic analysis of the streptococcal rodA gene. In the
present study, we investigated the prevalence of the rodA
gene in viridans streptococci and determined the phylo-
genetic relationship of the streptococcal rodA gene in
certain representative gram-positive bacteria by con-
structing a phylogenetic tree. It was revealed that the
genus Streptococcus, together with the genus Lactococcus,
formed one cluster of cocci in the dendrogram rooted by
genus Listeria, while Leuconostoc mesenteroides was
classified in the bacilli cluster.

In the field of

the water examination, since the
microbial population associated with denitrification can-
not be precisely identified by 16S rDNA-DGGE alone,
DGGE methods based on nirS and nirK have been
developed and applied (4244). Similarly, the application
of the DGGE to analysis of other housekeeping and/or
prevalent genes as an alternative or supplement to 16S
rDNA-DGGE is thought to offer a higher resolution to
analyses of complex microbial populations such as that of
the human oral cavity. In this study, for developing the
DGGE method for the analysis of the oral streptococcal
population, we used the rodA gene. We first performed a
phylogenetic analysis of the rodA gene derived from the 21
streptococcal species that may be isolated from the oral
cavity. The analysis results revealed that the phylogenetic
tree of
except
S. australis and S. infantis, with a phylogenetic resolution
that was 10 times that of the phylogenetic tree based on
16S rDNA. These results suggested that the rodA gene
possesses sufficient genetic diversity to identify viridans
streptococci and that phylogenetic analysis of this gene
may be an efficient tool for their classification and
identification. However, this phylogenetic analysis has a
potential limitation, since any analysis of oral streptococci
based on single gene loci may be flawed by inter-species
homologous recombination, which is not uncommon in
these bacteria (15, 45). In the present study, one possible
example of this may be the lack of discrimination between
S. australis and S. infantis. For this reason, we should
make an allowance for homologous recombination in the
identification based on single gene loci.

Next, we succeeded in developing a DGGE method
based on the diversity of rodA (rodA-DGGE) in order to

detect nine selected streptococcal species, which fre-
quently are isolated from the oral cavity and associated
with oral disease such as dental caries, and systemic
disease such as bacteremia and SBE (21). As we could
detect and differentiate the nine species in saliva by rodA-
DGGE without cultivation, it was suggested that our
developed method is an efficient initial screening test for
the detection of the pathogenic and commensal strepto-
cocci derived from the human oral cavity. Especially, in
the situation where the SBE-causing streptococci had
been isolated, our rodA-DGGE would provide the
opportunity to simultaneously evaluate the existence of
the infecting organism in the oral cavity, blood, the
infected organ, and saliva of the patient. Even though a
causative organism cannot be identified by this DGGE
method, sequencing analysis followed by Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search of the tested
rodA fragment will be able to identify the species among
the other 12 Streptococcus species that were not adopted
as reference markers. Although these 12 Streptococcus
species are minor in human saliva, e.g. Streptococcus
anginosus is one of the bacteria associated with bacter-
emia (21). For this reason, a database of rodA gene
sequences as well as other housekeeping genes is im-
portant (45). Moreover, we believe that identification
based on a combination of phylogenetic analysis of rodA
gene and 16S rDNA offers a higher resolution and
overcomes weaknesses in each method. For example,
although our method could not distinguish S. infantis
and S. australis, the phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA
could classify these species (46, 47). On the other hand,
although the phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA could
not clearly identify S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae
(16), our method could divide them.

In conclusion, we showed the prevalence and phyloge-
netic analysis of rodA gene in viridans streptococci and
demonstrated that identification based on the diversity of
rodA genes, containing rodA-DGGE, was convenient and
effective as an initial screening of viridans streptococci. In
our future clinical study, we will apply the phylogenetic
analysis of rodA gene containing rodA-DGGE to the
detection of SBE-causative streptococci by using the
bacterial DNA samples extracted from the isolated strep-
tococci, the blood, infected organ, and saliva of their host.
