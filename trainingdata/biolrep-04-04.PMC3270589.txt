Abstract
The lipid phosphatidic acid is an important metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of lipids in all
eukaryotic cells, but it is even more than that. Phosphatidic acid is emerging as a lipid that is both
composer and conductor, where in addition to its role as biosynthetic precursor (composer) it is also a
potent signaling molecule (conductor) that integrates membrane biogenesis with nutrient sensing and
cell growth. This article discusses recent advances in yeast that give praise for phosphatidic acid as one
of life’s conductors.

Introduction
Phospholipids are the core building blocks of most cellular
membranes, without which cells themselves would not
exist. The plasma membrane defines the outer-most
boundary for the chemistry of life and the inner membrane
systems or organelles provide an organisational framework
to compartmentalise the chemical reactions that we know
as cellular metabolism. And it is the combination of these
activities, membrane biogenesis and energy metabolism,
that enable cells to grow and multiply. It seems rather
obvious then, that cells need to co-ordinate membrane
biogenesis with basic metabolism to ensure successful
replication and the passing-on of their genes. This is
especially true for single-celled organisms that are, by
nature, at the mercy of the elements and must respond
to environmental changes quickly and efficiently, but is
also tremendously important during embryo-genesis in
metazoans, in which a single cell gives rise to a complex
multicellular organism.

How then do cells co-ordinate membrane production
with metabolism? To begin to answer this question we
will turn to a simple model eukaryotic cell, the budding
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast, because it is single-
celled, has evolved elaborate and dynamic ways to
control membrane synthesis in response to its environ-
ment. In the past three decades, tremendous progress has

been made in defining the fundamental metabolic
pathways that contribute to phospholipid synthesis
and turnover as well as defining many of the regulatory
mechanisms. Much of this foundation has arisen from
genetic and biochemical characterisation of yeast
mutants from a small group of key labs (for extensive
reviews see [1-3]). Their work has paved the way for
recent studies that, in large part through the use of new
cell and systems biology approaches, are uncovering
surprising links between membrane biogenesis and the
cell cycle.

This article will discuss the pivotal role for the lipid
phosphatidic acid as a signaling hub for the integration
of metabolic signals with membrane biogenesis. But why
phosphatidic acid? The reason is that phosphatidic acid
is a key metabolic precursor in the synthesis of both
phospholipids (which make up membranes) and neutral
lipids (such as triacylglycerol that is stored in cytoplas-
mic lipid droplets) and therefore sits at the crossroads
between membrane biogenesis and lipid storage (see
Figure 1). What better a lipid to sense the levels of then?
We will discuss the effects of key nutrients - inositol, zinc
and glucose - on regulation of
lipid metabolism,
emphasising how these affect the signaling activity of
phosphatidic acid to couple membrane biogenesis to
metabolism.

Control of membrane biogenesis, metabolism
and the cell cycle
Co-ordinate regulation of phospholipid metabolism by
phosphatidic acid and the transcriptional repressor Opi1
Lipid metabolism is co-ordinately regulated at
the
transcriptional level by a yeast transcription factor called

Opi1, which binds to and represses the bHLH transcrip-
tional activator complex Ino2-Ino4 at the promoters of
over 30 phospholipid metabolic genes. This regulation
has been extensively reviewed elsewhere [1]. Opi1 is
repressed by binding directly to phosphatidic acid in the
endoplasmic reticulum, which enables retention of Opi1

http://f1000.com/reports/b/4/4

outside of the nucleus away from the Ino2-Ino4 activator
complex [4]. Opi1 specifically senses endoplasmic reticu-
lum phosphatidic acid, because it
is this pool of
phosphatidic acid that acts as the metabolic precursor
for de novo synthesis of phospholipids and neutral lipids.
Depletion of endoplasmic reticulum phosphatidic acid
causes rapid unbinding and translocation of Opi1 to the
nucleus where it represses Ino2-Ino4 and the synthesis
of phospholipids. Co-ordinate transcriptional regulation
by Opi1 enables simultaneous control of synthesis of
multiple classes of phospholipids. By inhibiting Opi1,
phosphatidic acid promotes membrane biogenesis.

Regulation by inositol
Inositol
is a critical precursor for the synthesis of
phosphatidylinositol and the phosphoinositides, which
are major components of yeast cell membranes. Inositol
is a potent regulator of Opi1;
it acts by depleting
phosphatidic acid in the endoplasmic reticulum through
its conversion into phosphatidylinositol by the action of
phosphatidylinositol synthase (encoded by PIS1; see
Figure 1). The gene most dynamically regulated by Opi1
is INO1, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the
synthesis of inositol from glucose. This provides tight
feedback regulation of synthesis of inositol (i.e., high
levels of inositol deplete phosphatidic acid, activating
Opi1),
thus conserving glucose in the presence of
exogenous inositol. So why does the inositol signal act
through phosphatidic acid and repress synthesis of other
classes of phospholipids, namely phosphatidylcholine?
One answer is that, in addition to conserving glucose for
other metabolism, when inositol is abundant, yeast can
build membranes primarily with phosphatidylinositol
and therefore can afford to synthesize less phosphatidyl-
choline [4,5]. Abundance of inositol, likely from dead/
lysed yeast, may also indicate that other lipid precursors
are abundant, such as choline/lyso-phosphatidylcholine
that can be used to make phosphatidylcholine via salvage
pathways [6], thus supporting cell growth and conserving
glucose for other pathways. Thus, although it seems
counterproductive that in the presence of inositol, de novo
phospholipid synthesis is repressed, yeast are actually
conserving energy by directing glucose away from inositol
synthesis while simultaneously building membranes with
phosphatidylinositol. This decision in the end supports
membrane biogenesis and cell growth.

Regulation by zinc
Zinc is an essential mineral required for growth, where it
acts as a cofactor for many metabolic enzymes. Zinc
depletion can therefore generally be thought of as a stop-
growth signal and,
in yeast, zinc depletion provides
another example of co-ordinate regulation via phospha-
tidic acid signaling [1]. When cells are starved of zinc, the

zinc-sensitive transcriptional activator Zap1 upregulates
expression of two critical genes controlling the level of
phosphatidic acid in the endoplasmic reticulum. Upregu-
lation of phosphatidylinositol synthase, encoded by PIS1,
lowers the level of endoplasmic reticulum phosphatidic
acid through its conversion into phosphatidylinositol,
while upregulation of phosphatidic acid phosphatase,
encoded by PAH1, lowers endoplasmic reticulum phos-
phatidic acid through its conversion to diacylglycerol. This
combined effect of
lowering endoplasmic reticulum
phosphatidic acid in response to zinc depletion results
in co-ordinate repression of phospholipid metabolic
genes by Opi1, which shuts-down de novo phospholipid
synthesis. Regulation by zinc therefore provides the
cell with a rapid mechanism to downregulate membrane
biogenesis in anticipation of halted growth resulting from
an eventual decrease in metabolism.

Glucose, phosphatidic acid and the cell cycle
Clearly membrane biogenesis must be coupled with the
cell cycle such that the morphogenic cycle is in sync with
replication of the nucleus. Glucose is in prime position as
the master regulator of both the morphogenic and
nuclear cycles, given its dual roles as metabolic precursor
and energy source (see Figure 1). Glucose regulation of
yeast growth has been reviewed extensively elsewhere [7].
Glucose regulates the nuclear cycle by activating the
major Cdk in yeast, Cdc28, through a combination of
mechanisms including activation of the cyclins [8],
protein kinase A [9], TOR kinase [9] and likely through
other as-yet undefined pathways. Yeast happily use
glucose as their sole carbon source, meaning it is the
precursor in the synthesis of all classes of lipids. But does
the cell also use glucose availability as a signal regulating
lipid metabolism?

Kurat et al. in a very lucid study have uncovered a direct
link between the cell cycle and mobilisation of fat in the
form of triacylglycerol [10]. They find that the activity of
the triacylglycerol lipase, Tgl4, is directly regulated by
phosphorylation by Cdc28. Cdk activation of Tgl4
coincides with and is required for cells to enter G1 of
the cell cycle, and they find that the top signal for
activation is glucose availability. Triacylglycerol hydro-
lysis in the presence of glucose mobilises fat stores into
diacylglycerol and, through the co-operative action of
diacylglycerol kinase (Dgk1) [11],
into phosphatidic
acid, which can then be used as precursors for the
synthesis of phospholipids. The source of the triacylgly-
cerol is likely cytoplasmic lipid droplets, since this is the
location of the lipases, and lipid droplets are rapidly
consumed upon glucose addition. In fact, when de novo
fatty acid synthesis is blocked pharmacologically, lipid
droplets are sufficient to provide the precursors for

membrane synthesis and re-entry into the cell cycle [10].
An important consequence of this burst in triacylglycerol
hydrolysis is an increase in phosphatidic acid in the
endoplasmic reticulum, which, by repressing Opi1, turns
on de novo phospholipid biosynthetic pathways. Thus,
the signalling function of phosphatidic acid co-ordinates
cell cycle-activated hydrolysis of fat with production
of membranes, promoting cell growth in response to
glucose.

If triacylglycerol hydrolysis is the yin of fat metabolism
then phosphatidic acid hydrolysis is the yang. Pah1 is the
major phosphatidic acid hydrolase responsible for
conversion of phosphatidic acid in the endoplasmic
reticulum into diacylglycerol [12,13], which can then be
used for the synthesis of triacylglycerol in lipid droplets
[14]. Activation of Pah1 is therefore a key decision point
for the cell since Pah1 acts on the pool of phosphatidic
acid that is also the precursor for phospholipid synthesis
and hence membrane biogenesis. In fact, loss of Pah1
prevents lipid droplet formation and decreases cellular
triacylglycerol levels [14] and at the same time causes
expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum [13]. Blocking
de novo phospholipid synthesis, on the other hand,
elevates phosphatidic acid levels in the endoplasmic
reticulum, which results in increased triacylglycerol synth-
esis and the formation of so-called “super-sized” lipid
droplets [15]. Phosphatidic acid may even have a
regulatory role here beyond simply being a triacylglycerol
precursor, where its presence on the surface of lipid
droplets may control their size, number and fusion [15].
Importantly, balancing the flow of phosphatidic acid
between neutral lipids and phospholipids is critical for cell
growth and is an important function of Pah1.

Not surprisingly then, the activity of Pah1 is cell cycle-
regulated. Pah1 is phosphorylated by Cdk, which inhibits
its hydrolase activity [13,16]. During periods of the cell
cycle requiring membrane biogenesis, Pah1 is predomi-
nantly phosphorylated, which inhibits its activity,
diverting phosphatidic acid away from neutral
lipid
synthesis and making it available for synthesis of
phospholipids. Because this phosphatidic acid is located
in the endoplasmic reticulum, it also serves a signalling
function by regulating Opi1. The resulting increase in
endoplasmic reticulum phosphatidic acid represses Opi1,
which increases expression of phospholipid metabolic
genes that further promotes phospholipid synthesis. Pah1
is dephosphorylated and positively regulated by a con-
served phosphatase, Nem1; however, the links between
Nem1 and the cell cycle have yet to be established [17,18].
Nevertheless, constitutive activation of Pah1 through
overexpression of Nem1 arrests the cell cycle, which is
likely a result of triacylglycerol synthesis at the expense of

phospholipids, emphasising the impact that Pah1 and
ultimately phosphatidic acid in the endoplasmic reticu-
lum play in co-ordinating membrane biogenesis with
growth.

Phosphatidic acid is a pH biosensor
An unanticipated recent discovery was a role for intracel-
lular pH (pHi) in metabolic control of lipid metabolism.
pHi in all cells is rigorously maintained; however, until
now it was unclear if pHi was also used as a biological
signal. The major regulators of pHi in yeast are a P-type
ATPase of the plasma membrane, Pma1, and the V-ATPase
(for an excellent review see [19]). Pma1 controls pHi by
pumping protons generated by glycolysis directly out of
the cell [20], while the V-ATPase affects pHi directly and
indirectly, by pumping protons from the cytoplasm into
the vacuole and by regulating the trafficking of Pma1 [21].
Not surprisingly, glucose is also an important activator of
the pumps, which prevents over-acidification of the cyto-
plasm as a consequence of glycolysis. Glucose starvation
results in rapid pump inactivation and an acute drop in pHi
from ~7 to ~6. However, it was never established if the
drop in pHi was also a productive signal.

By taking a comprehensive systems-biology approach to
uncover new regulators of phospholipid metabolism,
Young et al. [22] have discovered that pHi is a signal
regulating binding of phosphatidic acid to Opi1. Their
genome-wide screen for yeast mutants that failed to grow
in the absence of inositol found an enrichment for genes
with functions in pHi regulation, including both the
V-ATPase and Pma1. Acidification of the cytoplasm
causes Opi1 to unbind the endoplasmic reticulum and
translocate to the nucleus, turning off phospholipid
metabolism. Because the headgroup of phosphatidic acid
is a phosphomonoester (most other phospholipids have
phosphodiesters) it has a pKa in the physiological range,
which means it becomes protonated with decreasing pHi
[23]. Young et al. find that Opi1 has lower affinity for
protonated compared with deprotonated phosphatidic
acid, and that binding is pH-dependent. These results are
consistent with the “electrostatic/hydrogen bond switch
model”, which provides an elegant explanation for
charge-dependent phosphatidic acid binding [24]. Lastly,
Young et al. [22] find that the drop in pHi upon glucose
starvation is the physiological signal that releases Opi1
from phosphatidic acid in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Thus, in addition to its role as a metabolic precursor,
glucose also exploits the signaling function of phospha-
tidic acid through changes in pHi
lipid
metabolism. In this special case, phosphatidic acid acts
as a pH biosensor that detects the metabolic status of the
cell and couples nutrient availability with membrane

to control

biogenesis. pH-sensing by phosphatidic acid enables the
cell to rapidly shut down phospholipid synthesis in
anticipation of depleted lipid precursors. But does pHi
then also signal lipid storage? Work by Dechant et al.
suggests it does [25,26]. They show that the drop in pHi
upon glucose starvation is a signal regulating protein
kinase A, which is likely sensed by the V-ATPase. Repression
of protein kinase A by low pHi may divert phosphatidic
acid away from phospholipids into neutral lipids by
dampening Cdk (Cdc28) activity and lowering the activity
of Tgl4 and Dgk1 while at the same time derepressing Pah1.
Thus, co-ordinated signaling functions for pHi, through
both protein kinase A and phosphatidic acid directly, may
be a means to rapidly balance the metabolic flux between
lipid storage and membrane biogenesis.

Conclusion
Because of our recent comprehensive understanding of the
lipid metabolic pathways, the location of the enzymes, and
even more recently, of the diversity and location of the lipid
species themselves (largely thanks to mass spectrometry
technologies) yeast lipids research is poised to be at the
forefront of new breakthroughs in lipid physiology. What
does the future hold? Let us turn back to the crossroads, to
phosphatidic acid, and to the cell’s decision to store fat or
to build membranes. Our work in yeast is telling us that
phosphatidic acid is poised to be a key molecule regulating
fat storage in humans, a process that is directly implicated
in multiple metabolic diseases including obesity, type 2
diabetes and the lipodystrophies [27]. The obvious role for
phosphatidic acid is as a lipid precursor, or composer, in the
synthesis of triacylglycerol, a major constituent of lipid
droplets. The availability of phosphatidic acid in the
endoplasmic reticulum and the regulation of key enzymes,
especially the lipin family of phosphatidic acid phospha-
tases, will be critical
factors [27]. But what about
phosphatidic acid as conductor? Tellingly, lipin plays a
dual transcriptional role in regulating hepatic lipid home-
ostasis, which is now found to involve nutrient sensing by
mTOR [28]. Phosphatidic acid is an important regulator of
mTOR [29], suggesting that phosphatidic acid is also
playing a signaling role in regulating lipid homeostasis in
humans. It therefore seems that real parallels can be drawn
between the yeast and mammalian systems, and that
perhaps lipids, as conductors, are the key to co-ordinating
membrane biogenesis with metabolism.
