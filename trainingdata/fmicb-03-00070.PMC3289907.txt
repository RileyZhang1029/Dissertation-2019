Northern peatlands are a large repository of atmospheric carbon due to an imbalance
between primary production by plants and microbial decomposition. The James Bay Low-
lands (JBL) of northern Ontario are a large peatland-complex but remain relatively unstud-
ied. Climate change models predict the region will experience warmer and drier conditions,
potentially altering plant community composition, and shifting the region from a long-term
carbon sink to a source. We collected a peat core from two geographically separated (ca.
200 km) ombrotrophic peatlands (Victor and Kinoje Bogs) and one minerotrophic peatland
(Victor Fen) located near Victor Bog within the JBL. We characterized (i) archaeal, bacterial,
and fungal community structure with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
of ribosomal DNA, (ii) estimated microbial activity using community level physiological
proﬁling and extracellular enzymes activities, and (iii) the aeration and temperature depen-
dence of carbon mineralization at three depths (0–10, 50–60, and 100–110 cm) from each
site. Similar dominant microbial taxa were observed at all three peatlands despite differ-
ences in nutrient content and substrate quality. In contrast, we observed differences in
basal respiration, enzyme activity, and the magnitude of substrate utilization, which were
all generally higher at Victor Fen and similar between the two bogs. However, there was
no preferential mineralization of carbon substrates between the bogs and fens. Microbial
community composition did not correlate with measures of microbial activity but pH was
a strong predictor of activity across all sites and depths. Increased peat temperature and
aeration stimulated CO2 production but this did not correlate with a change in enzyme
activities. Potential microbial activity in the JBL appears to be inﬂuenced by the quality of
the peat substrate and the presence of microbial inhibitors, which suggests the existing
peat substrate will have a large inﬂuence on future JBL carbon dynamics.

INTRODUCTION
Peatlands are important to the global carbon cycle as they are
large repositories of atmospheric carbon, with estimates ranging
between 270 and 455 Pg (1015) carbon, despite only covering 3%
of the Earth’s surface (Gorham, 1991; Turunen et al., 2002). This
is due to a relative imbalance between rates of net primary pro-
duction by plants and microbial decomposition (Clymo, 1984),
resulting from persistently water saturated environments and con-
sequent anoxia (Moore and Basiliko, 2006). Such conditions also
favor microbial CH4 production, thus peatlands are also signiﬁ-
cant sources of atmospheric CH4 (Moore et al., 1998; Laine et al.,
2007; Roulet et al., 2007), which has a global warming potential
23 times higher than CO2 under the IPCC’s 100-year timeframe
(Forster et al., 2007).

The James Bay Lowlands (JBL) are a large peatland-complex
that form the southeast part of the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada,
the second largest peatland area in the world (325,000 km2) after
the Western Siberian Lowlands (Riley, 1982; Gorham, 1991). Few
studies have been conducted on carbon biogeochemistry in the JBL

(Roulet, 2000; Yu et al., 2010), which represents a massive atmos-
pheric carbon store characterized by a mosaic of peatland types
that were formed under varying environmental conditions and
may differ in their sensitivity to environmental change (Martini,
2006). The JBL therefore represents both an important frontier
in peatland ecology and a signiﬁcant factor for the atmospheric
carbon balance.

Concern has been raised over the stability of the JBL carbon
store as climate models predict an increase in mean annual air tem-
perature of 3–4˚C by 2020 and 5–10˚C by 2050, with only minor
increases in precipitation of 10–20% in this region by the end of the
twenty-ﬁrst century (Hengeveld, 2000; Gagnon and Gough, 2005).
Warmer temperatures are expected to increase evapotranspira-
tion resulting in lower water table levels (Gorham, 1991; Roulet
et al., 1992). Short-term water table level ﬂuctuations may increase
decomposition as the presence of bimolecular oxygen (O2) acti-
vates phenol oxidases responsible for the degradation of phenolic
compounds (Sinsabaugh, 2010). This change can release hydro-
lase enzymes, responsible for labile carbon degradation, from

inhibition and has been referred to as the “enzymic latch theory”
(Freeman et al., 2001, 2004). Continued lowering of the water
table height may lead to a complete shift in plant community
composition (Weltzin et al., 2003; Laiho, 2006; Robroek et al.,
2007), potentially altering litter decomposability (Dorrepaal et al.,
2005), heterotrophic respiration (Moore and Basiliko, 2006), and
increased CH4 production (Hines et al., 2008).
Many studies have demonstrated that

temperature and
hydrology-related redox state directly control carbon mineral-
ization in peatlands (e.g., Moore and Dalva, 1993; Updegraff
et al., 1998; Keller et al., 2004). However, microorganisms ulti-
mately control peat decomposition and evidence indicates that the
soil microbial community composition is important to ecosystem
processes (Balser and Firestone, 2005; Reed and Martiny, 2007);
but its effects on carbon mineralization are unresolved (Waldrop
and Firestone, 2006; Bardgett et al., 2008; McGuire and Treseder,
2010). Soil pH has been identiﬁed as one of the most inﬂuential
factors controlling microbial diversity and community compo-
sition across soils types (Fierer and Jackson, 2006; Allison and
Treseder, 2008; Rousk et al., 2010). However, peatland micro-
bial diversity has not been extensively categorized (Kraigher et al.,
2006) but differences in microbial community structure have been
identiﬁed between peatland types (i.e., bogs and fens; Jaatinen
et al., 2007; Ausec et al., 2009; Peltoniemi et al., 2009) as well as
among depths down the peat proﬁle (Morales et al., 2006; Jaatinen
et al., 2007), potentially due to changes in pH.

Differences in microbial community composition among peat-
lands should be expected as vegetation varies from poorly decom-
posable mosses and shrubs in ombrotrophic bogs that only receive
nutrients from dry and wet deposition (Aerts et al., 1999) to more
easily decomposable sedges, herbs, and shrubs in minerotrophic
fens that receive nutrients from groundwater (Bragazza et al.,
2007). Although ecosystem models assume that microbial com-
munities are functionally redundant (Reed and Martiny, 2007)
differences in microbial activity have been observed among peat-
land habitats and depths (Fisk et al., 2003). Moreover, plant litter
decomposition rates have been shown to vary depending on both
the structure of the microbial community and the past resource
inputs a community has experienced (Strickland et al., 2009).
Given the contrasting botanical composition between bog and fen
peatlands, microbial communities may preferentially utilize their
“native” organic compounds to a greater extent than microbes that
have been exposed to peat with a different chemical composition.
In this study we used multiple approaches to characterize
depth-dependent microbial community structure and function in
two bogs and a fen within the JBL. This included molecular ﬁn-
gerprinting techniques, two independent estimates of microbial
activity and in vitro assays of microbial responses to changes in
aeration and temperature. We hypothesized that (i) pH is the dom-
inant control of microbial community composition and activity
among sites and depths, with more diverse communities observed
at higher pH, (ii) substrate utilization patterns of carbon com-
pounds will differ between the bogs and the fen, with the fen pref-
erentially mineralizing labile compounds and bogs mineralizing
more chemically complex compounds, (iii) measures of microbial
activity and community composition correlate with carbon min-
eralization, and (iv) higher peat temperature and aeration results

in greater rates of microbial activity, with the largest response
occurring in surface peat.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND PREPARATION
The climate of the JBL is described as being humid microthermal-
subarctic (Dcf), according to the Köppen Climate Classiﬁcation
System (Christopherson and Byrne, 2009). Annual total precipi-
tation ranges from 610 to 660 mm and mean temperatures range
from −29 to −15˚C in January and 12 to 18˚C in July between 50˚
and 52˚N (Martini, 2006). The region is essentially roadless, thus
it is difﬁcult to access and required the use of helicopters.

Three sampling locations were chosen based on their nutrient
status and distance from one another. Kinoje (51˚35
W)
(cid:2)
and Victor (52˚42
W) Bogs are separated by 206 km
and have similar characteristics. Both are ombrotrophic, char-
acterized by Sphagnum mosses and lichen (>50%), ericaceous
shrubs (primarily members of the genera Vaccinium and Kalmia;
>50% cover), and stunted black spruce (Picea mariana; ∼10%
cover). Victor Fen is located near Victor Bog (∼1.1 km), but
is minerotrophic and dominated by Carex spp. (>50%), with
patches of Sphagnum and brown mosses (Drepanocladus, Scor-
pidium, Aulacomnium; <50% cover), ericaceous shrubs (<25%
cover), and larch (Larix laricina; ∼10%). Due to logistical con-
straints, we were able to collect one peat core (Russian pear corer)
per site in the summer of 2009 to a depth of 2 m. All cores were col-
lected from hollows and immediately frozen at −18˚C at a nearby
research station prior to transport back to Toronto.

Subsamples from each core were taken at 0–10 cm (Surface,
above the water table), 50–60 cm (Middle, in a zone of ﬂuctuating
water table), and 100–110 cm (Deep, always below the water table).
Surface samples from both bog cores were weakly decomposed
and classiﬁed as H3 using the von Post system of humiﬁcation
(Rydin and Jeglum, 2006), while the fen surface was classed as
H4. All middle and deep samples were highly decomposed and
categorized as H8 and H9, respectively. To preserve the in situ
microbial community from being altered by thaw–refreeze cycles,
each sub-section was cut vertically in half while still frozen. The
microbial community composition and activity was assessed on
one of the sections while the second vertical section was subjected
to a temperature and aeration manipulation experiment (below).
When required for analysis the peat was thawed at 21˚C and gently
homogenized to reduce the variation within the sub-sample. Peat
moisture content was determined gravimetrically by drying 1 g of
wet peat at 105˚C for 24 h and peat pH was measured in reverse
osmosis puriﬁed water after 1 h (soil-to-water ratio of 1:4).

PROFILING THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY
Archaeal, bacterial, and fungal community structure within the
peat samples was proﬁled using terminal restriction fragment
length polymorphism analysis (T-RFLP). DNA was extracted from
each peat sample using the MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit
(MoBio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. To minimize DNA extraction bias
(e.g., Feinstein et al., 2009), three successive extractions were
pooled per peat sample. Archaeal rDNA genes were ampliﬁed

Edel-Hermann et al., 2004). The reaction mixture (50 μl) con-
sisted of 20 ng soil DNA, 36.5 μl H2O, 5 μl 10× buffer, 4 μl MgCl2,
1.25 μl dNTPs, 2 μl primers (forward and reverse), and 0.25 μl Taq
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA). DNA was ampliﬁed by PCR using a Primus
96 plus thermal cycler (MWG Biotech, Germany) with the follow-
ing reaction conditions: 5 min 94˚C, followed by 30 cycles of 94˚C
for 1 min, annealing temperature 1 min, 72˚C for 2 min and a ﬁnal
extension at 72˚C for 10 min. The annealing temperature for the
bacterial primers was 50 and 52˚C for archaeal and fungal primers.
For each sample, the PCR product of three reactions was pooled
to minimize ampliﬁcation bias.

The PCR products were puriﬁed in order to remove resid-
ual primers using a GenElute PCR clean-up kit (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and quantiﬁed
using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc, USA).
Archaeal T-RFLP analysis followed the method outlined by Lued-
ers and Friedrich (2000). Aliquots of puriﬁed archaeal amplicons
(50 ng) were digested using TaqI (3 U) and 1 μl of appropriate
buffer supplied by the manufacturer (New England BioLabs, USA)
and 1 μl of bovine serum albumin were combined to a total
volume of 10 μl and digested at 65˚C for 2 h. Bacterial T-RFLP
analysis followed the method outlined by Lukow et al. (2000).
Aliquots of puriﬁed bacterial amplicons (50 ng) were digested with
the restriction endonuclease MspI (10 U) and 1 μl of appropriate
buffer supplied by the manufacturer to a total volume of 10 μl
and digested at 37˚C for 3 h. Fungal T-RFLP analysis followed the
method outlined by Edel-Hermann et al. (2004). Aliquots of puri-
ﬁed fungal amplicons (50 ng) were double digested with AluI and
MboI (5 U) and 1 μl of the appropriate buffer supplied by the
manufacturer to a total volume of 10 μl and digested at 37˚C for
3 h. Terminal restriction fragments were measured on an ABI3730
DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with
GeneScan1000-ROX™fragment size standards (Applied Biosys-
tems) at the University of Guelph Lab Services (ON, Canada).
Terminal restriction fragment (T-RFs) lengths between 50 and
1200 bp were determined relative to the standards. T-RFs differing
by less that 2 bp were considered to be the same fragment and their
data combined and only T-RFs that represented≥ 1% of the total
sample were included for statistical analysis. The abundance (A)
of each T-RF was calculated as:

(cid:2)

A = ni

N × 10, 000

where ni is the peak height of one T-RF, N is the sum of all peak
heights in that sample, and multiplied by 10,000 so the data could
be analyzed using traditional ecological methods. Peak heights

were used in preference to peak area due to overlapping peaks
(Blackwood et al., 2003) and this method is more accurate at estab-
lishing relative gene abundances (Lueders and Friedrich, 2003).

Microbial biomass carbon (MB-C) and nitrogen (MB-N) was
determined using slight modiﬁcations to the chloroform (CHCl3)
fumigation extraction method by Vance et al. (1987). Three repli-
cate 10 g (wet weight) samples of peat from the sub-sections were
each split into two 5 g samples One sample was placed inside a
vacuum desiccator and fumigated with ethanol-free CHCl3 in
the dark for 24 h. Due to the high moisture content of the peat
soil, 0.5 ml of CHCl3 was added directly to the surface to aid cell
lysis (Ocio and Brookes, 1990) and a beaker of 1 N NaOH was
placed inside the desiccator to remove any excess CO2. CHCl3
vapor and residue was removed through repeated evacuation. All
peat samples were sealed in containers with 40 ml of 0.5 M K2SO4,
shaken for 1 h at 200 rpm on an oscillating shaker, and ﬁltered
through 0.45 μm glass ﬁber ﬁlters. The dissolved organic carbon
(DOC) and N (DON) concentration of the peat soil extracts was
measured with a TOC/TN analyzer (IL550, Lachat Instruments,
USA). MB-C and MB-N was calculated by subtracting the non-
fumigated extractable DOC/DON from the fumigated extractable
DOC/DON after correcting for differences in initial peat moisture
content.

ESTIMATING THE ACTIVITY OF THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY
Microbial metabolic potential within each JBL sample was esti-
mated by measuring the mineralization rates of four natural and
six synthetic substrates of varying chemical complexity and mol-
ecular weight. Brieﬂy, synthetic substrates were selected based on
their prevalence in natural plant tissues and ranged from simple,
low molecular weight compounds to large chemically complex
substances. These substrates included: alkali lignin and methyl-
cellulose, potentially representative of major, complex, high car-
bon concentration, structural compounds in many plants and
p-coumaric acid (a lignin derivative from non-woody plant tis-
sues), sodium benzoate (an aromatic organic acid and potential
lignin derivative), glucose (a cellulose derivative), and a com-
mercially available mixture of amino acids (protein derivatives,
Sigma-Aldrich catalog # R7131). The pH of the synthetic solu-
tions was adjusted to that of reverse osmosis water to avoid a
pH effect. Dissolved organic matter extracts from four plant types
(two sedge and two Sphagnum) were made by autoclaving chopped
plant material in reverse osmosis water and ﬁltered through a
0.45-μm glass ﬁber ﬁler. Each substrate was adjusted to a standard
concentration of 1 mg carbon ml

−1.

Substrate induced respiration (SIR) assays were conducted by
adding 10 ml of substrate (10 mg carbon) to 5 g of peat (wet
mass) in 30 ml serum vials each capped with a rubber stopper
and crimped. Reverse osmosis water acted as the control (basal
microbial activity). Vials were vigorously shaken by hand for 30 s
to ensure mixing and incubated under oxic conditions for 48 h
and anoxic conditions for 72 h. Anoxic conditions were created
through repeated evacuation with a vacuum pump and back-
ﬂushing with nitrogen (N2) gas and brought to atmospheric pres-
sure. Gas samples were taken using a 1-ml syringe following mixing
of the gas in the vial and CO2 concentrations were measured using
an infrared gas analyzer (Qubit Systems, Kingston, ON, Canada).

Peatland microbial communities and activities

CO2 production was monitored at ﬁve times periods (0, 4, 16, 24,
48 h) for the oxic assay and six time periods (additional measure-
ment at 72 h) for the anoxic assay and was calculated and expressed
as total mass of CO2 produced (using the ideal gas law) per gram of
dry peat. Preliminary analysis revealed that CO2 production rates
increased exponentially after 16 (oxic) and 48 (anoxic) h. Thus
to represent the initial responses of in situ microbial community
to substrate addition, comparisons of CO2 production were made
after 16 and 48 h for oxic and anoxic conditions, respectively. SIR
data are expressed as the ratios of CO2 production divided by basal
(control) respiration, allowing inter-site comparisons.

Potential extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) were deter-
mined following the method outlined by Saiya-Cork et al.
(2002). Brieﬂy, the activity of 1,4-β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase,
1,4,-β-N -acetyl-glucosaminidase, phosphatase, and sulfatase were
determined ﬂuorometrically using 200 μM methylumbelliferone
(MUB)-linked substrates. Peroxidase and phenol oxidase activities
were determined with a colorimetric assay using 25 mM l-3,4,-
dihydroxy-phenylalanine (l-DOPA) as a substrate; 10 μl of 0.3%
H2O2 was added to the peroxidase assay. A soil slurry was created
by combining 0.5 g of peat (wet mass) to 125 ml of acetate buffer
(50 mM, pH 5) and homogenized for 60 s with a hand blender. A
preliminary study showed that estimated enzyme activity was not
inﬂuenced by the mass of peat used (max. 2.5 g). For each enzyme
assay, 200 μl of soil slurry and 50 μl of speciﬁc substrate were
loaded onto a 96-well microplate with eight analytical replicates.
Each plate contained a positive and negative control. All assays
were incubated at 21˚C for 2 h, except for phosphatase and 1,4,-β-
N -acetyl-glucosaminidase assays which were incubated for 0.5 h.
To stop the reaction in the ﬂuorometric assays 10 μl of 0.5 N NaOH
was added at the end of the incubation period. Fluorescence (exci-
tation energy 365 nm, emission 460 nm) and absorbance (460 nm)
was measured using a multi-plate spectrophotometer (Synergy
HT, Biotek, USA).

TEMPERATURE AND AERATION CONTROL OF MICROBIAL ACTIVITY
To test how future environmental change might inﬂuence micro-
bial activity, peat microcosms for each sub-sample were established
by adding 5 g of homogenized wet peat to 20 ml serum vials. Each
vial was capped with a rubber stopper and crimped. Vials were
randomly allocated to one of four treatments with two tempera-
tures and either oxic or anoxic conditions: 4˚C oxic, 4˚C anoxic,
14˚C oxic, and 14˚C anoxic. Each treatment had three replicates.
Anoxic conditions were established by repeated evacuation and
back-ﬂushing with N2 gas and brought to atmospheric pressure.
Gas samples were taken at 90, 144, and 270 h and transferred to
10 ml pre-evacuated glass 10 ml crimped glass vials with butyl
rubber stoppers (Geo-Microbial Technologies Inc., Ochelata, OK,
USA), where they were later measured for CO2 and CH4 con-
centration using a SRI 8610-0040 gas chromatograph with a FID
and methanizer (SRI Instruments, Torrance, CA, USA). As the
enzyme assays required destructive sampling (0.5 g was removed),
one replicate per treatment was analyzed for each enzyme activity
per time period. The mass of the remaining peat was recorded
and the treatment conditions re-established. The fractional rate
of increase in microbial activity in the 14˚C over 4˚C temperature
(the Q10) was calculated for each site and depth.

STATISTICS
Enzyme activity and SIR ratios were analyzed with non-metric
multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination using Bray–Curtis
distance, while T-RF proportional abundance data (square-root
transformed) was analyzed with Sørensen’s distance. All the
NMDS ordinations were run using a random starting conﬁgu-
ration, a maximum of 250 iterations and an instability criterion of
0.00001; two dimensions were used for all plots and Monte Carlo
tests (1,000 randomized runs) was used to determine signiﬁcance.
The Shannon–Wiener index (Hill et al., 2003) was used to esti-
mate T-RF diversity. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s
post hoc test was used to determine differences in basal respiration.
Classiﬁcation and regression tree analysis (CART) was conducted
to partition the relative effects of peat sample and the experi-
mental variables on CO2 and CH4 production in the microcosm
experiment. Relationships between CO2 and CH4 concentration
were determined using Pearson’s correlation analysis. Exploratory
analysis of the measured variables was analyzed in two steps, as
there are more variables than peat samples, following a similar
method to Hudson et al. (2003). Firstly, variables that correlated
with basal CO2 respiration, pH, enzyme activity, and SIR data to a
probability level of < 0.1 were identiﬁed. Then, backward stepwise
linear multiple regression was used to identify the most important
variables. The residuals met the parametric assumptions of the
model. All statistics were performed following tests for normality
and heteroscedasticity. Data were natural log transformed when
parametric assumptions were not met and pH data were log10
transformed prior to analysis. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using R v. 2.13. (R Development Core Team, 2011) with
the package vegan for NMDS ordination (Oksanen et al., 2011)
and mvpart for CART analysis (De’ath, 2011).

RESULTS
PEAT pH
Victor Fen surface peat had the highest pH of 5.8 and there was
no difference in pH between middle and deep samples (pH 5.0).
Kinoje and Victor bogs were more acidic and had the same pH
value of 3.4 at surface and similar pH values of 3.2 and 3.4 were
observed in the middle peat samples and 3.8 and 3.5 in the deep
peat, respectively.

MICROBIAL COMMUNITY CHARACTERIZATION
NMDS ordination showed that the bacterial T-RFs among the peat
samples appeared to form a single cluster (Figure 1A), as many
abundant T-RFs were found among the peat samples (Table A1
in Appendix). However, bacterial richness was greatest in Kinoje
and Victor bogs and many of the same taxa were present in the
two peatlands although more unique T-RFs were found at Victor
Bog primarily at 0–10 cm and 50–60 cm (Table A1 in Appendix).
NMDS ordination of the archaeal T-RFs showed clustering among
the peatland types (Figure 1B), however many of the same T-RFs
were identiﬁed at each site and clustering appears to be driven by
a few rare T-RFs (Table A1 in Appendix). There was not enough
dissimilarity among the fungal T-RFs to separate by peat sample
with NMDS ordination.

Kinoje Bog MB-C at 0–10 cm was approximately six times
greater than at both Victor Bog and Fen (Table 1). MB-C generally

biomass 1.7 times greater than the surface. The carbon:nitrogen
ratio typically decreased from the surface to deep samples, but the
ratio was similar among all depth samples at Victor Bog.

MICROBIAL ACTIVITY
Aerobic basal CO2 respiration was signiﬁcantly higher in the Vic-
tor Fen surface and middle depth peat samples compared with the
deep fen peat and peat from all depths at both Kinoje and Victor

Bogs (F 4,18 = 84.0, p < 0.001; Figure 2). There was little difference
in CO2 production among the bog peat samples, except for Vic-
tor Bog middle depth where CO2 production was approximately
two times greater than surface and deep peat. Patterns of anaero-
bic basal respiration were similar to aerobic basal respiration and
were strongly correlated (data not shown).

The overall magnitude of substrate utilization in the oxic
SIR assay generally increased with depth as indicated by the

the NMDS ordination of the oxic SIR ratios revealed that most
of the deep peat samples clustered together (Figure 3A). Kinoje

the sites, but Kinoje and Victor Bog appear to have a similar
response. There was little clustering among the Victor Fen samples
(Figure 3B).

Enzyme activity generally decreased with depth, but the Kinoje
Bog middle depth sample had higher B-xylosidase, cellobiohydro-
lase, sulfatase, and peroxidase activities (Table 3). NMDS ordina-
tion of the initial EEAs showed that Victor Bog and Fen surface
samples had similar activities (Figure 3C). While Kinoje Bog sur-
face peat had much lower enzyme activities (between 2.5 and 6
times; Table 3) the samples did cluster close to the Victor peat-
land surface samples. Similarly, Kinoje and Victor bog middle and
deep samples clustered together, whereas Victor Fen middle and
deep peat formed their own group as enzyme activities were much
higher (range 0.5–12.7 times).

INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND AERATION ON MICROBIAL
ACTIVITIES
Temperature only affected potential CO2 production rates in the
surface peat samples at Victor Bog and Victor Fen (Figure 4), where

rates were highest in the oxic treatment at 14˚C and lowest in the
anoxic treatment at 4˚C. Although potential CO2 production rates
in an oxic environment were greatest at Victor Fen, the largest
effect of temperature was observed at Victor Bog in both aera-
tion conditions. Mean Q10 values at Victor Bog were 1.57± 0.05
and 2.34± 0.07, and 1.46± 0.03 and 1.52± 0.16 at Victor Fen in
an oxic and anoxic environment, respectively. In contrast, simi-
lar potential CO2 production rates were observed in the middle
and deep samples at both Victor Bog and Victor Fen. Interestingly,
temperature and aeration states did not have an affect on poten-
tial CO2 production rates at Kinoje Bog, where higher rates were
found in deeper peat. Overall, anoxic potential CO2 production
rates followed a similar pattern to oxic production rates, and there
was a strong correlation between the two (t 52 = 15.5, p < 0.001,
r 2 = 0.82).

Similarly, temperature had no effect on potential CH4 pro-
duction rates in any peat sample and there was no difference in
potential CH4 production rates among the middle and deep peat
samples at all three peatlands (Figure 5). Compared to middle

and deep peat samples the potential CH4 production rates in
surface peat at Victor Fen were 2 times greater and 3.7 times
greater at Victor Bog, but were approximately 50% lower at Kinoje
Bog. Moreover, anoxic CH4 production rates correlated with oxic
(t 52 = 5.2, p < 0.001, r 2 = 0.34) and anoxic (t 52 = 4.7, p < 0.001,
r 2 = 0.29) CO2 production rates.

Measured EEA in the microcosm experiment at 90, 180, and
270 h did not correlate with CO2 production in either the oxic or
anoxic environments, except for a weak correlation between oxic
CO2 production and sulfatase (t 106 = 4.3, p < 0.001, r 2 = 0.15),

but this was primarily driven by the absence of enzyme activity in
deep peat.

INTERACTIONS AMONG MEASURED VARIABLES
Although basal CO2 respiration correlated well
for several
variables with r values ranging from 0.6 to 0.85 (Table 4),
only pH was included in the ﬁnal regression model (basal
−1 = 0.07+ 0.48(pH); F 1,7 = 8.5, p < 0.05, adjusted
CO2 mg g
r 2 = 0.49). Similarly, pH could also explain anoxic SIR val-
ues (Anoxic NMDS SIR= 1.41–0.35(pH); F 1,7 = 32.3, p < 0.001,
adjusted r 2 = 0.77), but not oxic SIR values. Despite pH corre-
lating well with several enzyme activities, it was not signiﬁcant
in the ﬁnal regression model. Interestingly, bacterial and fun-
gal diversity did not correlate with pH, but good correlations
were observed for measures of archaeal diversity and pH. Overall

Peatland microbial communities and activities

(0–15 cm) than in deep peat (1 m). Although this may have been
due to the relatively low detected richness level relative to Morales
et al. (2006), it suggests that at least the dominant members of
the microbial community are always present, despite presumed
differences in oxygen content with depth.

Little is known about the role of fungi in peatlands, but diverse
communities have been found beneath the Sphagnum mat and in
close association with ericaceous shrubs (Thormann, 2006; Artz
et al., 2007) and different fungal communities have been linked to
the vegetation and nutrient status of peatlands (Artz et al., 2007;
Trinder et al., 2008). Fungi are generally thought to predominate
in peatland lawns and hummocks (Jaatinen et al., 2007) as they
cannot utilize alternative electron acceptors in anoxic environ-
ments and successfully compete with bacteria for carbon substrates
(Killham and Prosser, 2007). Thus it was interesting that most
fungal taxa were identiﬁed at all three depths among the three
JBL peatlands. Fungi are typically most competitive under an oxic
environment, however they can carry out fermentation. So their
abundance at depth may in part be due to a lack of alternative inor-
ganic electron acceptors (e.g., sulfate) that might otherwise have
facilitated anaerobic bacterial respiration in these deep anoxic peat
samples. This might also imply that facultative fungi supply fer-
mentation products that ultimately fuel methanogenesis (Conrad,
2007).

Consistent with prior studies, microbial biomass decreased
with depth probably due to the presence of more labile organic
matter and higher redox states typically found near the surface
of peat proﬁles (Blodau and Moore, 2002; Blodau et al., 2004;
Basiliko et al., 2007). Although microbial biomass across sites was
generally quite small compared to other bogs and fens (Moore and
Basiliko, 2006), it was similar to that in mined peatlands in more
southern regions of Canada that have relatively low nutrient and
carbon availability (Basiliko et al., 2007); which might indicate
that substrate or nutrient availability for heterotrophic microbial
communities is low even in the fen site. Decreasing MB-C:MB-N
ratios with depth has been observed elsewhere (e.g., Basiliko et al.,
2007) and is probably due to decreasing fungal:bacterial ratios
with depth and the fact that bacteria typically have higher ana-
bolic N requirements (Killham and Prosser, 2007). Bacteria often
predominate in deeper more anoxic peat layers as they can utilize
alternative electron acceptors (Killham and Prosser, 2007). Micro-
bial biomass did not correlate with potential CO2 production rates
in contrast to previous studies (Blodau et al., 2004; Basiliko et al.,
2007). However, this may simply reﬂect the low microbial biomass
and low amount of labile carbon in our sites.

MICROBIAL ACTIVITIES
Despite the similarity of the microbial communities among the
three peatlands, there were differences in basal respiration, ini-
tial enzyme activities and substrate utilization patterns. Greater
microbial activity was observed in the fen compared to the bogs,
possibly due to the higher in situ nutrient concentrations and
greater carbon substrate availability typically found in fens (Moore
and Basiliko, 2006; Knorr and Blodau, 2009). Overall the average
oxic SIR ratio response was very similar among deep peat samples
in all three peatlands and greater than those in both the surface and
middle peat samples. Deeper peat is older and typically has lower

depths (0–10, 50–60, and 100–110 cm) from peatlands in the James Bay
Lowlands, Canada. See Figure 4 for CART explanation.

enzyme activity (NMDS values) correlated with bacterial diversity,
but the regression was not signiﬁcant, but there was no relationship
with archaeal or fungal diversity.

DISCUSSION
MICROBIAL COMMUNITY CHARACTERIZATION
The same dominant microbial taxa identiﬁed using T-RFLP were
found among all three peatlands despite differences in geographic
location, nutrient status, and plant community composition. This
contradicts our initial hypothesis and previous studies where
differences in microbial community composition have been iden-
tiﬁed among peatlands with different vegetation characteristics
(Ausec et al., 2009; Peltoniemi et al., 2009; Andersen et al., 2010).
However, this ﬁnding is consistent with previous peatland studies
comparing bacterial communities in two similar fens in Slove-
nia (Kraigher et al., 2006) and archaea and bacteria in Sphagnum
dominated bogs across the northeastern USA (Basiliko et al., 2003;
Morales et al., 2006). In contrast to previous studies (Bååth and
Anderson, 2003; Fierer and Jackson, 2006; Rousk et al., 2010),
where higher bacterial diversity is associated with more neutral
pH, a greater number of taxa were actually detected in the more
acidic bogs rather than the fen. Moreover, there was no correlation
between pH and the microbial community structure or diversity
indices. However, the range of peat pH values in the JBL was rel-
atively small, which may explain why diversity was not explained
by pH. Furthermore, pH also appeared not to inﬂuence microbial
community composition in other peatland studies (Kraigher et al.,
2006; Ausec et al., 2009), suggesting that the relationship between
pH and microbial diversity in general might be less important in
peatland ecosystems.

Richness was also similar among the depths with few taxa con-
ﬁned to a single depth proﬁle, in contrast to Morales et al. (2006)
who found a greater number of bacterial T-RFs in surface peat

levels of labile carbon (Glatzel et al., 2003; Artz et al., 2006). Thus,
the microbial community at these depths was probably substrate
limited relative to the surface peat. However, this trend disappeared
in the anoxic SIR assay, as there was little difference in the response
among depths between Kinoje and Victor bogs. In contrast, Vic-
tor Fen had greater average SIR values in the surface peat sample,
likely as a result of higher redox substrate concentrations (Knorr
and Blodau, 2009; Webster and McLaughlin, 2010).

This apparent contradiction between microbial activity and
community composition may be explained by differences in peat
organic matter quality. Plant litter from bogs and fens have differ-
ent nutrient concentrations (Bragazza et al., 2007) and therefore
microorganisms in these contrasting habitats will have different
nutrient requirements. Recently, Straková et al. (2011) identiﬁed
litter type as the main factor affecting microbial EEA in bog peat
soil. Similar to our study the authors reported higher enzyme activ-
ities in peat composed of vascular plants, typical in fens, rather
than Sphagnum dominated peat and also failed to identify a strong
relationship between microbial community composition and EEA.
Moreover, the differences in SIR activities, identiﬁed by the NMDS
ordination, among sites was primarily due to the magnitude of
the response, but the relative substrate utilization patterns (i.e.,

among the 10 substrates) were actually similar among the three
peatlands despite our hypothesis that the two bogs and fen would
preferentially mineralize different substrates, probably because the
microbial communities were similar. The subdued response to
substrate addition in the bogs may be due to inhibitory effects of
Sphagnum leachates on microbial activity (Verhoeven and Toth,
1995; Hättenschwiler and Vitousek, 2000; Hájek et al., 2010). Fur-
thermore, vegetation type has been shown to inﬂuence microbial
activity more than water table drawdown (Trinder et al., 2008;
Straková et al., 2011) and small changes in the plant community
composition can have profound affects on microbial processes,
such as methanogenesis (Hines et al., 2008).

The relatively high N -acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity
throughout the peat proﬁle suggests a high metabolic demand
for N released during chitin turnover (Sinsabaugh et al., 1993)
and corresponds with presence and identiﬁcation of fungal taxa
at all peat depths. This contradicts our previous ﬁnding that
carbon:nitrogen ratio decreases with depth and might represent
bacterial dominance of decomposition due to higher N demand.
However, it is not certain whether fungi or bacteria produced
these enzymes or what the speciﬁc activity of the fungi is in
deep peat. Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis found that shifts

Peatland microbial communities and activities

in bacterial to fungal dominance across environmental gradients
often do not correlate with changes in element cycling and may
be due to niche overlap between fungal and bacterial commu-
nities (Strickland and Rousk, 2010). In an antibiotic inhibition
assay, Winsborough and Basiliko (2010) showed that bacteria
dominated peatland microbial activity; while fungal activity did
increase in acidic dry bogs it was still lower than bacterial activ-
ity. Although we do not have direct measurements of fungal
biomass, these results suggest that our understanding of the rela-
tionship between fungi and ecosystem function in peat soil is
incomplete.

We did not ﬁnd a relationship between microbial community
composition and activities in contrast to our hypothesis. Although
this could be due to the issues of the taxa-level resolution using T-
RFLP small-subunit rDNA, this ﬁnding highlights the importance
of carbon substrate as a proximate control of microbial commu-
nity dynamics because similar communities can perform different
functions given different resources and conditions.

ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
As predicted and consistent with previous studies (Moore and
Dalva, 1993; Updegraff et al., 1998; Keller et al., 2004), an increase
in aeration of the peat soil stimulated CO2 production rates, but
only in Victor Bog and Fen, and temperature only affected rates
in the surface peat samples. This suggests that oxygen availability
is more important than temperature in increasing mineralization
rates, possibly brought about by an increase in enzyme activity
in response to a release from inhibition through the “enzymic
latch theory” (Freeman et al., 2001, 2004). However, CO2 produc-
tion did not correlate with enzyme activity probably because the
enzymes measured in this study may only be a subset of those actu-
ally involved in peat decomposition (Horwath, 2007). Potential
CO2 production rates among the depths were lower in anoxic con-
ditions but there was a strong correlation between oxic and anoxic
CO2 production consistent with previous investigations (Moore
and Dalva, 1997; Yavitt et al., 1997; Glatzel et al., 2004). These ﬁnd-
ings suggest that similar peat properties control the activities of

CONCLUSION
Microbial community composition was very similar among peat-
lands and at depths within the JBL despite differences in geo-
graphic location and nutrient status. In contrast, microbial activity
appears to be determined by the quality of the peat substrate and
the presence of potential microbial inhibitors. As climate change
is expected to cause a shift in JBL plant community composition,
this study suggests that the microbial community will respond
quickly to changes in plant litter and root exudate quality but
the existing peat substrate will probably have a large inﬂuence
on future microbial activity. For example, a shift from Sphagnum
to sedge-dominated peatlands may not necessarily result in the
expected increase in carbon mineralization due to the antimicro-
bial properties of the Sphagnum-peat. Interestingly, we identiﬁed
fungal taxa in deep peat but it is unclear what anaerobic processes
are occurring and how these organisms inﬂuence carbon cycling.
Thus, more in depth proﬁling of the JBL microbial community
and identiﬁcation of the potential constraints on microbial activ-
ity is required in order to better predict future peatland carbon
dynamics.
