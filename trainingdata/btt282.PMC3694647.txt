BIOINFORMATICS  EDITORIAL  Vol.
29 ISMB/ECCB 2013, pages i1 i2 doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt282  Editorial  This special issue hosts the proceedings of the joint 21st annual meeting of Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) and 12th European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB), which will take place in Berlin, Germany, between July 21 and 23, 2013 (http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013).
This official conference of the International Society for Computational Biology (http://www.iscb.org/), preceded by 11 Special Interest Group (SIG) meetings of 1 or 2 days, two satel- lite meetings, a Student Council Symposium, Junior Principal Investigators Symposium and two half-day tutorials during July 19 20, 2013, is likely to be the largest annual gathering in the field.
The 40 articles in this volume were selected from 233 submis- sions divided into 13 research areas, led by 26 area chairs.
The chairs selected their area s program committee and oversaw the reviewing process.
The chairs included a blend of individuals with experience from previous years and newcomers.
Twelve sub- missions for which area chairs were in conflict were reviewed within  Applied Bioinformatics  headed jointly by the two area chairs and the proceedings chair  four were accepted.
Areas, co- chairs and acceptance data are listed in Table 1.
A two-tire review procedure was used, which is different from previous years.
Of the total submissions, 89 were accepted to round two, including some with conflicting opinions.
Of these, 85 were submitted to the second round.
The final decision was  made based on the revised submissions, taking into consideration the authors response to the reviewer reports, as well as reviewer reports on the revisions.
Only 40 articles could be accommodated in the proceedings, forcing us to turn down 35, many of which were of high quality.
I was hoping that the authors of most of these would be granted the opportunity to submit revised manu- scripts to Bioinformatics, where they could be evaluated while their review history is considered.
Unfortunately this opportunity was granted only to 11 manuscripts  I hope that if submitted, these will be readily accepted.
More importantly, I would like to extend my apology to the authors of the remaining 24 who went through highly demanding and painful review process.
I am hopeful that the authors of these manuscripts found the reviewer comments helpful.
The division into areas was somewhat different this year.
Two new areas were defined:  Metabolic Networks  and  RNA Bioinformatics  and chairs and reviewers with suitable expertise recruited.
Databases and Ontologies  and  Text Mining  were merged into a single area.
All in all 368 members of the bioinformatics community pro- vided reviews.
Most articles were assigned to three reviewers and some to four or more.
There was significant discussion of the merits of the articles first between referees and the area chairs, and then between area chairs and the proceedings chair.
The review also included two conference calls with the area chairs.

I thank the area chairs and reviewers for their hard work in maintaining a professional review process  it has been harder and longer this year.
I thank Steven Leard s team for extensive tech- nical support with the EasyChair submission and reviewing  system  the team at Oxford University Press for type-setting the articles  Conference Chairs Burkhard Rost, Anna Tramontano and Martin Vingron, as well as the ISMB 2013 Steering Committee, for their valuable input  and Steven Leard for helping us oversee the process.
Special thanks to Mona Singh for her valuable notes from 2010 and to Bonnie Berger for many good advices at critical moments.
