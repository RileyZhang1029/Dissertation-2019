Enhanced anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) have disturbed their biogeo-
chemical cycling in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.The N and S cycles interact with one
another through competition for labile forms of organic carbon between nitrate-reducing
and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Furthermore, the N and S cycles could interact through nitrate

INTRODUCTION
Human-induced disturbances to the nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S)
biogeochemical cycles, resulting for instance from atmospheric
deposition and agricultural activities, have altered the global stor-
age and ﬂuxes of those elements (Schlesinger, 1997; Galloway et al.,
2008). More speciﬁcally, the N and S loadings to aquatic ecosys-
tems have increased dramatically due to anthropogenic activities
in recent decades (Schlesinger, 1997), which lead to intensiﬁed
interactions between the N and S cycles. For example, increased
N loading associated with coastal development may lead to over-
lapping zones of abundant N and S in tidal creeks and salt marsh
estuaries (Howarth et al., 1996). Furthermore, S content in fresh-
water ecosystems used to be too low (Holmer and Storkholm,
2001) for interactions between the N and S cycles to play a signif-
icant role in the biogeochemical cycles of those elements in such
systems. However, salt water intrusion due to frequent hurricanes
and storm surge caused by climate change in coastal areas (Eric-
son et al., 2006) have resulted in an increase in S concentrations in

freshwater systems. Furthermore, whereas atmospheric S deposi-
tion from fossil fuel burning has decreased in North America and
Europe due to air pollution control measures (Mayewski et al.,
1990; Fischer et al., 1998), it is still important in southern Asia
(Duan et al., 2007). There is consequently a pressing need to
understand how biogeochemical processes constitutive of the N
and S cycles will interact with one another in these human-altered
environments. The N and S cycles are driven by microbially medi-
ated reactions affecting the redox states of both elements, and
consequently their mobility and availability. Among them, denitri-
−
ﬁcation converts nitrate (NO
) to dinitrogen gas (N2), effectively
3
removing N from the soluble and bioavailable pools (Knowles,
1982). Similarly, S cycling in anoxic aquatic sediments involves
both reductive and oxidative processes (Holmer and Storkholm,
) are commonly used as
2001). Both NO

anoxic sediments, with NO

than SO2−

a widespread process carried out by members of the alpha, beta,
gamma, and epsilon Proteobacteria, Gram-positive Bacteria, and
Archaea (Zumft, 1997; Philippot, 2002), sulfate reduction is more
specialized and restricted to members of the delta Proteobacte-
ria and Archaea (Wagner et al., 1998; Muyzer and Stams, 2008).
Whether as a competitive or inhibitory phenomenon, a decrease
in sulfate reduction has been reported upon nitrate addition
(Westermann and Ahring, 1987; Whitmire and Hamilton, 2005).
Sulﬁde as the ﬁnal product of sulfate reduction can be microbially
oxidized coupled to nitrate, manganese, and iron reduction in
anoxic environments or rapidly incorporated into minerals such
as iron monosulﬁdes (FeS) and pyrite (FeS2) (Thamdrup et al.,
1994). An important interaction between the N and the S cycles
is denitriﬁcation coupled with biotic sulﬁde oxidation (Brettar
and Rheinheimer, 1991; Garciagil and Golterman, 1993; Burgin
−
and Hamilton, 2007). The biogeochemical importance of NO
3
use by S-oxidizing bacteria has been widely recognized in marine
sediments (Brettar and Rheinheimer, 1991) as well as freshwater
sediments (Brunet and GarciaGil, 1996; Whitmire and Hamilton,
2005) and groundwater systems (Engesgaard and Kipp, 1992; Jor-
gensen et al., 2009). This process is used to mitigate toxic sulﬁde
−
production in organic-rich sludge through NO
3 - mediated sul-
ﬁde oxidation (Schwermer et al., 2010). Vice versa, elemental sulfur
−
has also been applied to wastewater treatment to remove NO
3 by
−
coupled sulfur oxidation and NO
3 reduction (Sierra-Alvarez et al.,
2007).

Numerous studies have investigated the environmental (physi-
cal and biogeochemical) factors controlling the N and S cycling to
better understand the processes involved, interpret the observed
rates, and extrapolate them across temporal and spatial scales
(Cornwell et al., 1999; Seitzinger et al., 2006; Wallenstein et al.,
2006; Burgin and Hamilton, 2007). Most of those studies however,
have examined the N and S cycling separately, either on individ-
ual sites or single ecosystem and the controls vary across systems.
Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate the envi-
ronmental factors controlling N and S biogeochemical reaction
rates in a range of littoral sediments. For that purpose we compared
fourteen surﬁcial aquatic sediments from lakes, rivers, estuaries,
salt marshes, and marine coastal sites that were characterized by a
wide range of water salinity, pH, NO
concentration,
as well as sediment porosity, organic carbon (Corg), N, Arsenic
(As), and iron (Fe) contents. We subsequently investigated pos-
sible interactions between the N and S cycles via comparison of
−
N and S biogeochemical reaction rates measured when NO
3 and
SO2−
4 were present separately or concomitantly. Understanding
the effects of environmental parameters on the coupled N and S
cycles will help us elucidate potential mechanisms that lead to this
coupling and generalize our ﬁndings across ecosystems types.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STUDY SITES
We conducted a multi-site study, investigating surﬁcial sediments
from 14 aquatic systems ranging from freshwater to hypersaline in
the USA and Europe. Identical analytical methods were used at all
sites and a large number of water and sediment physical and chem-
ical characteristics were measured as described below. The sites
include temperate lakes, rivers, salt marshes, estuaries, and marine

coastal waters in France, the Netherlands, and the USA (California;
see Table 1). Sites were selected to encompass a range of salinities,
as well as NO
concentrations in sediment overly-
ing waters. We sampled two freshwater sites (Tresmes, Créteil),
eight estuarine and salt marsh sites covering brackish (Elkhorn
Slough, Elkhorn Slough Marsh, Waarde), brackish/saline condi-
tions (Pescadero, Baylands) and saline conditions (Hourdel Port,
Hourdel Salt Marsh, Rattekaai), two marine sites (Humboldt Bay
and North CA Coast) and two hypersaline sites (Mono Lake Boat
Launch and Mono Lake Black Point). Intact surﬁcial sediment
cores (4.2 cm inside diameter) were collected from each site and
samples corresponding to the top 1 cm of the sediments were used
for the ﬂow-through experiments and physico-chemical charac-
terization (except North CA Coast and Humboldt Bay where the
top 2 cm were used). All estuarine sediments were sampled by
hand in intertidal mudﬂats. River and lake sediments were sam-
pled by hand 1–2 m from the river bank in water depths no greater
than 0.5 m to avoid surface perturbations and sediment resuspen-
sion. Marine sediments from the North California (CA) Coast
and Humboldt Bay were sampled from a ship at water depths of
70 and 10 m, respectively, using a bottom grab device that left the
sediment surface intact. All sediment samples were transported
and stored at 4˚C under anoxic conditions for 1–3 days until the
experiments started.

from the weight loss of a known volume of wet sediment sample
after drying (2 days at 105˚C or freeze drying). Corg, total N and
total S contents were determined using a Carlo Erba CN analyzer.
Mean grain size of bulk sediment was determined with a Malvern
Instruments Mastersizer S, after removal of organic matter (with
6% H2O2) and carbonate (with 1 N HCl), followed by chemical
(in 4.5% Na4P2O7 + 4.2% Na2CO3) and ultrasonic dispersion.

As and Fe were extracted from sediments after 0.2 g freeze dried
samples were digested in 10 mL 2 M trace metal grade HCl for
24 h. Total As concentrations were determined by graphite fur-
nace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) on a Unicam_989
QZ spectrometer. Total Fe concentrations were determined by a
ﬂame atomic absorption spectrometer and a solar S spectrometer.

FLOW THROUGH REACTOR EXPERIMENTS
Steady-state reaction rates [e.g., maximum potential nitrate and
sulfate reduction rates, and nitrite and ammonium production
rates] were measured on intact sediment slices using recently
developed ﬂow-through reactors (FTRs; Roychoudhury et al.,
1998; Laverman et al., 2006; Pallud and Van Cappellen, 2006;
Pallud et al., 2007). Undisturbed surface sediment slices were col-
lected directly in Plexiglas® reactor cells (4.2 cm inside diameter
and 1 or 2 cm long) between June 2006 and July 2008. Input
solutions were supplied to the reactors at a constant ﬂow rate
(Q = 2± 0.15 mL h
−1) using peristaltic pumps, and the reactor

The input solutions were sterilized, then made anoxic by boiling

in Mono Lake, the inﬂow pH for these reactors was adjusted using
Na2CO3 (0.047 M) and NaHCO3 (0.28 M). For each site, two sets
of duplicate reactors were treated as follows: one set was supplied

POTENTIAL REACTION RATE CALCULATIONS
For each of the N1, N2, S1, S2, N1S2, N2S1 steps, potential
steady-state reaction rates were calculated. Nitrate reduction rates
(NRR), nitrite production rates (NiPR), ammonium production
rate (APR), and sulfate production rates (SPR) were calculated for
N1 and N2. Sulfate reduction rate (SRR), and APR were calculated
for S1 and S2. Finally, NRR, NiPR, SRR, and APR were calculated
for N1S2 and N2S1. Rates were determined by multiplying the

and output solutions normalized per volume of sediment for time
intervals during which the outﬂow concentrations of the externally
supplied electron acceptors (NO

stant (Laverman et al., 2006; Pallud et al., 2007), which typi-
cally happened after 10–24 h. Rates are expressed throughout in

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
MATLAB 9.0 was used to compute descriptive statistics and gen-
erate box plots of variables. Since the data were skewed, variables
were log transformed before correlations and regressions were
calculated. Variables having zero values were expressed as log
(variable+ 1). Log transforms improved the symmetry of the dis-
tributions. Differences in reaction rates across treatment types
were tested with one way repeated measures ANOVA.

A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on
the environmental variables and biogeochemical reaction rates,
respectively. A multivariate analysis was conducted to analyze the
relationships between explanatory variables (i.e., environmental
variables) and response variables (i.e., biogeochemical reaction
rates). The ﬁrst step is to use detrended correspondence analyses
(DCA) to obtain the gradient length of response variables. The lin-
ear model redundancy analysis (RDA) was suggested by the small
gradient lengths (<1.5 SD). Stepwise RDA (Canoco Version 4.53;
Wageningen, the Netherlands) was selected to study the effects
of environmental variables on sediment biogeochemical reaction
rates. RDA is a type of direct gradient analysis (Vandenwollen-
berg, 1977) that summarizes all the variance of response variables
which is related to the explanatory variables and, at the same time,
provides a synthetic and simple interpretation of the relationships
between response and explanatory variables. Signiﬁcant predic-
tors were chosen using Canoco’s forward selection procedure in the
order of greatest additional contribution to the explained variance,
but only if their addition did not cause any variation inﬂation fac-
tor to exceed 3.0. Statistical signiﬁcance of variation components
were tested with Monte Carlo Permutation tests (104 unrestricted
permutations) on the trace statistic (Terbraak and Verdonschot,
1995). In the RDA triplot, the correlation between environmental
variables and biogeochemical reaction rates is given by the cosine
of the angle between the two vectors. Vectors pointing in roughly
the same direction indicate a positive correlation, vectors cross-
ing at right angles indicate a near zero correlation, while vectors
pointing in opposite direction show a high negative correlation.

RESULTS
WATER AND SEDIMENT CHARACTERISTICS
Physical and chemical characteristics of the sediment and water
column from the 14 study sites are summarized in Table 1. The
overlying water pH and salinity values ranged from 6.5 to 10.8
and from 0.5 to 79.6, respectively. The Corg:N ratio ranged from
3.6 to 19.1. The highest values (11.6 and 19.1) were observed in the
freshwater sediments. The sediment S and Fe content ranged from
−1 dry sediment,
0.07 to 2.04% and from 5.53 to 112.11 μmol g
respectively, with the lowest values measured in the freshwater
sediments. Sediment As content varied from below detection limit
−1 dry sediment and the lowest sediment As
(bdl) to 696.62 nmol g
content were observed in the freshwater sediments.

The results of the PCA of the environmental variables revealed
two main axes that explain most of the variation in all water and
sediment characteristics (Figure 1). The ﬁrst two principal compo-
nents (PCs) explained 32 and 20% respectively of the total variance
in the data. Correlations can be estimated by perpendicularly pro-
jecting the arrow tips of the other variables onto a particular
variable arrow. The ﬁrst component was mainly related to salinity,
−
SO2−
3 concentration in the overlying water and sed-
iment As content. The second PC was associated with sediment
grain size and, to a lesser extent, with sediment total Fe content.
Sediment total Fe content tended to increase with decreasing grain
size. Coarse-grained sediments were generally poor in total Fe. In
addition, sediment Fe content correlated positively with sediment
S contents. The Fe and sulfur contents were negatively correlated
to the Corg:N ratio. The highest measured sediment N contents
were associated with the highest measured Fe and/or S content. In
general, sample sites were heterogeneously distributed around the
origin of the coordinate system. On the basis of the distribution
of sample PC scores on the PC1 and PC2 axes, several distinct
sectors can be described: (1) the two hypersaline Mono lake sites
(#13 and 14) characterized by high pH, salinity, SO2−
in over-
lying water and sediment As content; (2) the river sediment site
−
at Tresmes (#1) characterized by the highest NO
3 in overlying
water and the highest Corg:N ratio; (3) the salt marsh estuarine
site Rattekaai (#10) characterized by high sediment S and Fe con-
tent; (4) the salt marsh site and two near coast marine sites (#6,
11, and 12) characterized by ﬁne texture and high sediment Fe
content. The rest of the sample sites were within these extreme
sectors.

BIOGEOCHEMICAL REACTION RATES OF N AND S CYCLES

rather than ﬁeld observed actual rates. The ﬁrst two PCs explained
58 and 26% respectively of the total variance in the data. The
ﬁrst axis is related to NRR, NiPR, APR, and SPR. The second axis
is deﬁned mainly by SRR. NiRR increased with increasing NRR.
Furthermore, NRR and APR for N treatments (i.e., N1 and N2)
correlated strongly with those for NS treatments (i.e., N1S2 and
N2S1). In contrast, there was no signiﬁcant correlation between
SRR for S treatment (i.e., S1 and S2) and SRR for NS treatments
(i.e., N2S1 and N1S2). Several distinct sectors can be distinguished
in all sediment sites based on the PC scores distribution: (1) the
two hypersaline Mono Lake sites (#13 and 14) characterized by
−
high NRR and NiPR, and low SRR in the presence of NO
3 ; (2)
the river sediment site at Tresmes (#1) and the freshwater lake site
at Créteil (#2) characterized by the highest SRR; (3) the estuarine
site Rattekaai (#10) characterized by the highest APR; (4) the two
near coast marine sites (#11 and 12) characterized by the lowest
NRR and APR.

Nitrate reduction rates were highly variable within a given
treatment [coefﬁcient of variance (CV) ranged from 39 to 64%,
Figure 3]. There was no signiﬁcant difference for the NRR (p = 0.5,
repeated measures ANOVA) among the four treatment groups
(i.e., N1, N2, N1S2, N2S1). The variances of NRR for N treatments
were slightly larger than those for NS treatments.

Sulfate reduction rates varied greatly within a treatment (CV
ranged from 46 to 94%, Figure 4). The simultaneous application

Note that the SRR here represented an apparent or net SO2−
removal after subtracting SO2−
produced by sulﬁde oxidation.
By adding the SPR for the N treatments to the net SRR, we obtain
estimates of the gross SRR (i.e., corrected SRR). Interestingly, there
was no signiﬁcant difference in the gross SRR between the S and NS
treatments (p = 0.64, repeated measures ANOVA). Additionally,

The largest within-treatment variance was observed in APR

the NS treatments had a greater variation of APR than the N or S
treatment. The extremely high APR values indicated by the three
outliers were all from the Rattekaai site.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS ON BIOGEOCHEMICAL REACTION RATES
Relationships between N and S biogeochemical reaction rates and
the environmental variables measured were examined by RDA
using the potential reaction rates measured on intact sediment
slices as response variables for both separate and simultaneous
addition of NO
(see Flow Through Reactor Exper-
iments and Potential Reaction Rate Calculations) and the envi-
ronmental variables listed in Table 1 as explanatory variables. The
relative importance of various environmental factors is shown in
Table 3. The single variable that explained the greatest percent-
age of variability in sediment biogeochemical reaction rates was
the pH (lambda, the percentage of the variability explained by a
single variable, is 0.24), followed by sediment As content, grain
size, and N content that explained 21, 17, and 13% of the variabil-
ity, respectively. After stepwise forward selection by RDA, three
variables, namely pH, salinity, and N content, that had a signif-
icant effect on the reaction rates in the sediments were retained
(p < 0.05 tested by Monte Carlo permutation, Table 3). The pH,
salinity, and sediment N content describe the most variance (54%)
in the set of response variables that included all reaction rates.
Exploratory RDA indicated that the pH of overlying water had
the largest effect (lambda A, the additional percentage of vari-
ability explained by a variable after the forward selection, is 0.24,
Table 3) for the N and S reaction rates. Salinity and sediment
N content, as strong indicators of freshwater-marine ecosystem
gradients, added an additional 18 and 12% to the total explained
variance.

Redundancy analysis results are visualized in triplot ordination
diagrams. Figure 6 shows the ordination diagram derived from
running an RDA using the reaction rates measured when only one

1Lambda 1 indicates the percentage of the variability in the sediment biogeo-
chemical reaction rates explained by a single variable.
2Lambda A indicates the percentage of the variability explained by a variable after
the forward selection starting from the best variable (marginal effects).
Each subsequent variable is ranked on the basis of the ﬁt that the variable gives
in conjunction with the variables already selected (conditional effects). p and F
values indicate the level of signiﬁcance of each variable obtained by Monte Carlo
permutations under the null model with 499 random permutations.The signiﬁcant
environmental variables were marked in italic bold.

electron acceptor was added (treatments N and S). The ﬁrst axis
(horizontal) displayed a gradient of APR, and to a lesser extent, of
SPR, NRR, and NiRR. The second axis (vertical) represented SRR,
which were negatively correlated with salinity of the overlying
water. In addition, the pH vector points in the same direction as
the NRR and NiPR vectors indicating a signiﬁcant positive corre-
lation between pH and NRR and NiPR. pH explained 23% of total
variance, followed by salinity that contributed an additional 23%
and by sediment N content that explained an additional 15% of
the total variance in reaction rates. The sites 1–5, 8, and 13 fol-
lowed the salinity gradient strongly, while the sites 1–5, 7, and 12
were predominantly affected by the gradient of sediment N con-
tent. Finally, the variations associated with sites 5, 6, 8, 9, and 14
were mainly attributed to the variations in pH.

An ordination diagram derived from running an RDA using the
reaction rates measured for the NS treatments is shown in Figure 7.
Again, pH and salinity are the two most dominant environmental
variables that explained 30 and 17% of the total variance in reac-
tion rates, respectively. The ﬁrst RDA axis (horizontal) increased
with decreasing pH and the second RDA axis (vertical) increased
with salinity. The vectors of NRR and NiPR loaded negatively on
the ﬁrst axis, and pointed in a same direction as pH, indicating a
positive relationship with this explanatory variable. On the other
hand, the vectors of SRR pointed roughly in a direction opposite
to the salinity vectors, suggesting an inverse relationship between

these variables. Contrary to the RCA results for reaction rates
measured when only one TEA is present (N and S treatments,
Figure 6), sediment N content was not selected as a signiﬁcant
environmental factor on the reaction rates for the NS treatments.
To study the effect of environmental factors on the relative dif-
ferences in NRR and SRR measured for separate (N or S) and
simultaneous (NS) additions of NO
4 , we derived a
new set of response variables named Ratio_NRR and Ratio_SR,
deﬁned as the ratio of NRR and SRR measured in NS treatment
compared to NRR and SRR measured for N and S treatment,
respectively. These ratios indicate either an increase or a decrease
in NRR or SRR when both TEAs are added compared to the supply
of only one TEA. Stepwise RDA analysis (Figure 8) showed that the
sediment As content (28%), Fe content (17%), and Corg:N (14%)
accounted for 59% of the total variance of the differences in NRR
and SRR between separated or simultaneous addition of TEAs.

DISCUSSION
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS ON POTENTIAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL
REACTION RATES
The PCA and RDA results revealed three dominant gradients in
the variations in the sediment potential biogeochemical reaction
rates. Gradient (1) is characterized by variations in the NRR, NiPR,
and SPR, which were closely correlated with the overlying water
pH. Gradient (2) is characterized by variations in the APR, which
were mainly controlled by the sediment N content. Gradient (3) is
characterized by variations in the SRR, which were correlated with
the overlying water salinity.

Environmental controls on nitrogen and sulfur cycles

The RDA analysis suggested a signiﬁcant positive relationship
between in situ water pH and NRR and NiRR, which is in agree-
ment with previous ﬁndings. Song et al. (2011) found a correlation
between potential denitriﬁcation rates and the pH of the overlying
water in constructed wetlands. In fact, several studies have shown
that acidic conditions may reduce or even completely inhibit the
nitrate reduction process in aquatic sediments (Knowles, 1982).
In the present study, the in situ pH of overlying water is mostly
slightly alkaline except for a slightly acidic pH of 6.5 at the near
shore marine site, and for a hyperalkaline pH at the two Mono
lake sites. Glass and Silverstein (1998) found that NRRs as well
as the nitrate to nitrite ratios increased with above-neutral pH in
activated sludge of a synthetic wastewater containing high nitrate
concentration. Similar results were obtained in laboratory batch
experiments by Zhang et al. (2009) showing increased nitrite
accumulation with increasing pH. Nitrite accumulation associated
with nitrate reduction with increasing pH might be attributed to
inhibition of nitrite reductase at high pH (Zhang et al., 2009).

Furthermore, our results suggest a positive correlation between
APR and the sediment N pool. Sediment N can originate from
various sources such as phytoplankton, benthic algae, and littoral
deposition. As a result, littoral sediments are usually associated
with high N content. In this study, the highest APR corresponded
to the N rich sediment at the Rattekaai site, whereas the low-
est APRs were found at two deep non-littoral marine sediments
(#11 and #12). High N content sediments might lead to high APR
through intensive anaerobic organic matter degradation and con-
sequent nitrogen mineralization. Previous studies also observed
+
increasing NH
4 production with decreasing Corg:N ratio (Black-
burn and Henriksen, 1983). Under anoxic conditions, another
+
NH
source is dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium
4
(DNRA). Our results, however, did not conﬁrm that DNRA is
+
signiﬁcant. In fact, if DNRA was a major source of NH
4 , higher
APR would be observed in the N only treatments than in the S only
treatments. However, we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant difference in
APR between these two treatments.

Finally, a freshwater to saline water gradient, represented by
salinity in overlying water explained a large portion of variance
of the sediment SRR. In situ salinity showed an inverse relation-
ship with SRR. Under in situ conditions, SRR in most freshwater
systems are usually very low and considerably lower than in most
marine systems (Capone and Kiene, 1988) due to the limited SO2−
present in the overlying water. Despite these low in situ rates and
activities, sulfate reducers have shown to be present and diverse
in freshwater sediments (Kondo et al., 2007; Miletto et al., 2008),
and with high potential activities (this study, Pallud and Van Cap-
pellen, 2006; Kondo et al., 2007), most likely due to their metabolic
diversity (Muyzer and Stams, 2008). In addition, in hypersaline
anaerobic environments, the signiﬁcant energetic requirements
associated with halophilism may preclude the existence of micro-
bial groups that obtain little energy from dissimilatory processes,
including sulfate reduction (Oren, 2011). This could explain why
the lowest SRR were observed in the two hypersaline sites.

4

We found both similarities and differences in the sets of envi-
ronmental factors that explain the variance in the sediment N
and S potential reaction rates between separate and simultaneous
addition of NO
4 . Both treatments suggest that pH and
salinity are the two most important predictors of variability of

sediment N and S reaction rates. However, when NO
were added separately, the APR were also signiﬁcantly affected by
sediment N content, but not when NO
4 were added
concomitantly. This indicates that other process(es) than anaer-
+
obic organic nitrogen mineralization might contribute to NH
4
production when N and S were added together.

Distinct biogeochemical processes in response to separate and
simultaneous addition of NO
can also be suggested by
the comparison of NRR and SRR between separate addition and
simultaneous addition of NO
4 . Sediment As, Corg:N
ratio, and Fe content were the main factors that explained the
variation of the NRR and SRR changes. The coupled sediment S,
As, and Fe cycles, probably through the reactions listed in Table 4,
explained the lower SRR in sediments when NO
4 were
present. On the other hand, the quality of sediment organic mat-
ter, indicated by Corg:N ratio, might account for the majority of
variance in the NRR changes.

well likely, considering the metabolic versatility of both the SO2−

of nitrate is due to the use of different electron donors by the
two bacterial groups. In addition, the sediment matrix could
provide a spatial separation of the different microbial groups
resulting in coexistence instead of a competition between the
two processes within these sediments. Whether spatial separa-
tion or the use of different carbon pools allows the coexistence
of sulfate and nitrate reduction in these sediments is subject to
ongoing work.

sulﬁde produced as a result of SO2−
reduction, did not signiﬁ-
cantly affect NRR. The strong correlation between NRR measured
for N only and for NS treatments suggested that same processes
−
must be involved in NO
3 reduction. Sulﬁde has been shown to
inhibit nitrate reduction in estuarine and coastal sediments (Senga
et al., 2006; Aelion and Warttinger, 2009). However, a positive effect
of sulﬁde addition on NRR has been found in oxidized and low
organic matter sediments (Canﬁeld et al., 2010). Recent work in a
marine environment off the Chilean northern coast suggests that
−
NO
3 reduction is enhanced by sulﬁde addition in ocean waters
(Canﬁeld et al., 2010). In our study, however, the amount of sulﬁde
produced as a result of SO2−
reduction was too low to enhance or
−
inhibit NO
3 removal
due to sulﬁde oxidation to SO2−
4 by multiplying the ratio of the
−
measured SPR to NRR by 1.6, which is the molar ratio of NO
reduced to SO2−
3
4 produced as shown in Equation 1 (Table 4). In
−
our survey, NO
3 mediated sulﬁde oxidation accounts for a small
−
portion (∼9%) of total NO
3 reduction on average, implying that
−
this process did not affect overall NO
3 reduction signiﬁcantly.
Furthermore, the observation that SO2−
4 was produced in the
absence of SO2−
addition suggests that sediment S content is the
main source of sulﬁde in our systems, probably from sediment
bound sulﬁde rather than produced by SO2−
reduction. How-
ever, the effect of SO2−
reduction as a sulﬁde source cannot be
underestimated due to the fact that sediment sulﬁde is ultimately
regenerated from SO2−
−
4
In addition to NO
3 , oxidized metal(loid) species, such as Fe,
Mn, and As, could be preferentially used over SO2−
4 by microor-
ganisms as TEA for anaerobic respiration. For example, it has
been shown that direct sulﬁde oxidation by Fe(III) might lead
to SO2−
4 production (reaction 4, in Table 4; Holmer and Stork-
holm, 2001). In our study, SRR decreased in the NS treatments
with increasing sediment As content suggesting that SRR might be
inhibited by As, possibly by As(V) produced via As(III) oxidation
coupled to NO3-reduction. Such an anoxic oxidation of As(III)
linked to chemolithotrophic denitriﬁcation was shown to be fea-
sible in continuous bioreactors (Sun et al., 2010). The oxidized As
subsequently affect the sediment S cycle in two ways. First, As(V)
and/or As(III) inhibit SO2−
reduction, presumably through a toxic
effect (Dowdle et al., 1996). Second, SO2−
4 might be produced
through As(V)-mediated sulﬁde oxidation (reaction 5 in Table 4).
Recent studies (Hoeft et al., 2004; Oremland et al., 2005; Hol-
libaugh et al., 2006) found that sulﬁde oxidation coupled to As(V)

reduction appears to proceed via a two electron transfer, resulting
in the production of As(III) and of an intermediate S compound
such as thiosulfate that is subsequently disproportionated into sul-
fate. Oxidized Mn might also serve as electron acceptor to oxidize
iron sulﬁde minerals (reactions 6 and 7 in Table 4). However, we
did not measure sediment Mn content in our study and conse-
quently cannot conﬁrm the occurrence of Mn-mediated sulﬁde
oxidation.

ALTERNATIVE NITRATE REMOVAL PATHWAYS
Our observation that in 70% of the studied sites SO2−

coupled to sulﬁde oxidation by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria is sup-
ported by research in both marine and freshwater ecosystems
(Dannenberg et al., 1992; Fossing et al., 1995; Brunet and Gar-
ciaGil, 1996; Otte et al., 1999). On average, 9% of the NRR can
be accounted for by sulﬁde oxidation to sulfate in our studied
sediments (Laverman et al., 2012), which is much lower than the
range of 25–40% reported for freshwater ecosystems (Burgin and
Hamilton, 2008). Note that these could be minimum estimates
because of the possibility that some of the S oxidation does not
proceed completely to SO2−
4 .

−
3 to NH4+

We were not able to ascertain the ultimate fate of the added
−
NO
3 (i.e., denitriﬁcation or DNRA) in our sediments. Inhibition
of denitriﬁcation by the presence of free sulﬁde might favor the
reduction of NO
rather than to N2O and N2 (Brunet
and GarciaGil, 1996), though accumulation of N2O has also been
observed (Senga et al., 2006). An increase in NRR due to DNRA
coupled with S oxidation would likely be accompanied by an
increase in APR (Payne et al., 2009). However our results did not
show signiﬁcant increase in APR when NO
4 were added
together, ruling this hypothesis out. On the other hand, metal-
bound sulﬁdes (e.g., FeS) could potentially enhance denitriﬁcation
to N2 (Brunet and GarciaGil, 1996). We consequently speculate
−
that denitriﬁcation instead of DNRA is the major pathway of NO
3
reduction that couples with metal-bound sulﬁde oxidation in the
present study.

−
3 and SO2−

Our RDA results revealed that nitrate-mediated oxidation of
iron sulﬁde (FeS) or Fe disulﬁde (FeS2), rather than free sulﬁde,
might account for SO2−
4 production (reactions 2 and 3 in Table 4).
This is supported by the positive correlation between change of
SRRs (NS vs. S) and sediment Fe contents in our RDA analysis.
FeS and FeS2 are compounds resulting from the chemical pre-
cipitation of reduced Fe and sulfur, and are commonly found in
sediments, such as those investigated in this study. The sediment
Fe content correlated positively with sediment S contents in this
study, which indicated that iron and sulﬁde could be present as
iron sulﬁde minerals such as FeS and FeS2. The oxidation of iron
disulﬁde coupled to NO
as end prod-
uct (Brunet and GarciaGil, 1996). Under anoxic conditions FeS or
FeS2 can be used as electron donors for denitriﬁcation by faculta-
tive anaerobic lithotrophs (Benz et al., 1998; Schwientek et al.,
2008). Jorgensen et al. (2009) recently found that around 65–

CONCLUSION
−
3 and/or
Our study shows that the effects of the presence of NO
SO2−
on biogeochemical N and S cycles are complex, depend-
ing on various environmental factors. The environmental factors
that explained the variability in the N and S biogeochemical reac-
tion rates when NO
4 were present simultaneously
were in situ water pH and salinity, whereas sediment N con-
tent, in situ water pH and salinity were the best explanatory
variables when NO
4 were present separately. More
speciﬁcally, potential NRR were positively correlated to in situ
water pH and potential SRR were inversely correlated with salinity.
Furthermore, the highest sediment As or Fe content was associ-
−
ated with the largest reduction in the potential SRR when NO
or SO2−
3
4 were both present. Finally, our results indicate that the
simultaneous presence of NO
led to sulfur oxida-
−
tion coupled with NO
3 reduction and metal-bound S, instead of
free sulﬁde produced by SO2−
reduction, was responsible for this

implies that sediment N cycling is closely linked to the S cycling
across a wide range of sediments. Increased SO2−

in freshwater ecosystems will lead to sulﬁde production in such

ecosystems, where sulﬁde concentrations are usually low (Capone
and Kiene, 1988). This sulﬁde can either be oxidized coupled to
nitrate reduction as shown in this study, or serve as a sink for poten-
tially toxic metals, such as As, Cd, Hg, and Pb (Moller et al., 2004).

Increasing anthropogenic NO
3 input from acid deposition and
agricultural runoff to ecosystems might affect the S cycle by stim-
ulating anoxic iron sulﬁde oxidation in iron sulﬁde rich sediments.
As observed in this study, the magnitude of the sulﬁde oxidation
−
coupled to NO
3 reduction increases with increasing sediment As
and Fe content, which means that saline sediments rich in metal
(such as As and Fe) would be more strongly affected. Through the
release of toxic metals by metal sulﬁde oxidation (Morse, 1994;
Haaijer et al., 2007), this stimulation will have adverse effects on
aquatic ecosystems. It is therefore crucial to better understand the
coupling between the N and the S cycles given that NO
inputs to ecosystems are enhanced by anthropogenic activities, and
are expected to increase in the future.
