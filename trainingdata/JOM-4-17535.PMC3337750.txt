Aim: Find the periodontal treatment that best maintained clinical results over time evaluated by changes
in pocket depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL).
Methods: 229 patients with chronic periodontitis from USA (n134) and Sweden (n95) were randomly
assigned to eight groups receiving (1) scalingroot planing (SRP) alone or combined with (2) surgery
(SURG)systemic amoxicillin (AMOX)systemic metronidazole (MET); (3) SURGlocal tetracycline
(TET); (4) SURG; (5) AMOXMETTET; (6) AMOXMET; (7) TET; and (8) SURGAMOXMET
TET. Antibiotics were given immediately after SRP. Plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing,
suppuration, PD, and CAL were recorded at baseline and after 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Treatment
effects were evaluated by linear multilevel regression and logistic multilevel regression models. We considered
only data from sites with a baseline PD of at least 5 mm of 187 patients completing the study.
Results: Surgically treated patients experienced most CAL loss. Adjunctive therapy including SURG
was most effective in reducing PD. Combining SURG with AMOX, MET, and TET gave significant clinical
benefits. Past and current smoking habits were significant predictors of deeper PD. Only current smoking
was a significant predictor of CAL loss. Bleeding, accumulation of plaque, gingival redness, and suppuration
were significant predictors of further CAL loss and deeper PD.
Conclusions: Both surgical and non-surgical therapies can be used to arrest chronic periodontitis. SURG
AMOXMETTET gave best maintenance of clinical results.

Chronic periodontitis in mild to moderate forms

is considered the most common form of period-
ontitis occurring worldwide with prevalences
from 13 to 57% in different populations depending upon
oral hygiene and socioeconomic status (1). Treatment
combinations are often recommended for periodontitis.
Such combinations include removal of tooth-borne bac-
terial plaque and calculus often in conjunction with
periodontal surgery (SURG). Addition of antibiotics

aims at suppressing pathogenic microorganisms and
allowing recolonization with those compatible with
health (2).

In the current study, the effectiveness of eight different
therapies including combinations of therapies on two
established markers of periodontitis, pocket depth (PD)
and clinical attachment level (CAL), was compared. The
therapies were scaling and root planing (SRP), SURG,
and systemic and local antibiotics.

The necessity for pocket elimination by SURG has
been challenged. The main objective of SURG is to
contribute to long-term preservation of the periodontium
by promoting plaque removal and infection control.
However, it has been suspected that SURG may initiate
loss of CAL through a detrimental effect on osteo-
blasts. Subantimicrobial doses of doxycycline reduce
gingival collagenolytic activity by inhibiting neutro-
phil matrix metalloproteinases (38). The present study
assessed whether loss of CAL associated with SURG
could be diminished by combining SURG with antibio-
tics such as systemic amoxicillin (AMOX) and systemic
metronidazole (MET) and locally delivered tetracycline
(TET).

Studies on periodontal

treatment have generally
indicated that it immediately improves clinical para-
meters of periodontitis. Usually, adjunctive systemic
antibiotic treatment provides better results than SRP
alone, particularly in terms of PD reduction and gain
of CAL (911).

Several studies have tested the effect of local appli-
cation of TET in the management of periodontitis
(1216). MET has been used alone (11, 17, 18) or in
combination with AMOX (1820). AMOX has been used
to suppress periodontal pathogens and increase the
gain of clinical attachment (21). METAMOX have
been applied successfully in the treatment of adult
periodontitis, especially in Aggregatibacter actinomyce-
temcomitans-associated infections (22, 23). Even though
systemically administered adjunctive antibiotics may
provide better clinical results than SRP alone, little is
known if any of these agents are more effective than
others when long-term clinical effects are considered.

The effectiveness of a therapy is usually masked by
risk factors for health such as smoking habits. Responses
after periodontal treatment are thought to be modified
by cigarette consumption. Current smokers experience
poorer clinical responses than former or never smokers

(2426). A therapy may also work well in one ethnic
group and fail to reproduce similar results in a different
ethnic group. Differences have been demonstrated in the
prevalence of periodontitis between and across continents
(27, 28). In the present study, white Americans, Swedes,
African Americans, and Asians were examined to see
how they maintained over time the beneficial clinical
status achieved by different periodontal therapies. There
are no clear inherent differences between males and
females in their susceptibility to periodontitis, but men
have worse periodontal health than women in multiple
studies from different populations (2830).

When analyzing clustered longitudinal clinical data
on periodontal disease, tooth sites are nested in teeth,
which are in turn nested within patients and share a
common feature of correlated observations. Because of
this hierarchical structure (Fig. 1), analysis assuming
independence of observations is rendered inappropriate.
Any method of analysis that attempts to aggregate the
data at patient level results in loss of valuable information
and may not explicitly reflect the site-specific nature of
periodontal disease (31, 32). Furthermore, it is reasonable
to assume that based on the severity of the disease,
periodontal therapies are likely to vary not only between
patients but also between tooth sites in subjects.

The use of random effects in multilevel modeling is
one common and convenient way to model such grouping
structure (33, 34). It is therefore appropriate to consider
‘site within tooth’ and ‘tooth within patient’ to be
random factors. We used this approach that takes into
account the clustering effect of the data and provides
reasonable explanations
for how therapeutic effects
change over time.

The main aim of the present study was to compare
the clinical effectiveness of eight different therapies in
periodontitis. We examined changes in PD and CAL to
assess treatment effects. In particular, we were interested
in comparing if patients receiving SURG alone main-

tained their improved clinical status for a shorter period
than patients treated with SURG combined with systemic
or local antibiotics. The hypothesis was that SURG
combined with systemic or local antibiotics gives better
long-term clinical results than SURG alone. All treat-
ments were compared to SRP (control).

The study also aimed at determining whether treatment
reduced PD in sites or subjects by1.5 mm or if it
could produce CAL gain of 1.5 mm. We also examined
the effects on the periodontal treatment of underlying
explanatory variables
smoking habits,
race, nationality and gender. The current study, based
on previously published data (35),

version is given here.

Study group
A total of 229 (109 females and 120 males) American
(n134) and Swedish (n95) patients aged 2079 years
(mean 48) were originally recruited for this 2-year follow-
up study. The Americans were collected at the Forsyth
Institute and at Boston University, Boston, and the
Swedes at the University of Go¨ teborg. In the Swedish
population, 98% of the subjects were white versus 60%
in the US population. Current smokers constituted 57%
of Swedish subjects and 25% in US subjects. Patients
were in good general health and had at least 15 natural
teeth including minimum one molar in each quadrant
and at least 4 teeth with PD]5 mm and 8 teeth with
CAL3 mm at baseline. Males and females of any race
were accepted to participate. Participants, of whom 187
completed the study, were followed up for 2 years and
the data on different clinical measurements recorded
from all teeth except third molars. The experiments were
undertaken with the understanding and written consent
of each subject. The study design was independently
reviewed and approved by the Review Boards of the
Forsyth Institute, Boston University, and the Ethics
Committee at the University of Go¨ teborg.

Exclusion criteria were known allergies to the anti-
biotics to be used, antibiotic or periodontal treatment
last 3 months, pregnancy, nursing, or systemic conditions
that would influence the course of periodontal treatment,
or allergy to amoxicillin, metronidazole, tetracycline,
lidocaine, or chlorhexidine.

Experimental design and treatment
The patients were stratified into current smokers and
non-smokers and randomly assigned to permuted blocks

of eight different treatment combinations. A clinical
co-coordinator assigned the patients to each group.
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the
patients in the eight groups. All patients had equal
chances of being assigned to any of
the therapies.

SRP
At baseline, all subjects received SRP performed under
local anesthesia and usually finished in four weekly visits.
During SRP treatment, subjects rinsed twice daily with
0.1% chlorhexidine.

Systemic antibiotics
Systemic antibiotics were given as 14 days of medication
(metronidazole 250 mg3 and amoxicillin 500 mg2).
This therapy started immediately after the first session
of SRP and was administered parallel to local tetracy-
cline fiber application. Compliance was reported by the
patients.

Local tetracycline
Local antibiotics were given as
tetracycline fibers
(Actisite†, Proctor and Gamble, Cincinnati, OH) in
pockets]5 mm immediately after mechanical
instru-
mentation at the SRP visits. The fibers were removed
after 7 days, i.e. at the next appointment for quadrant-
wise SRP.

Surgery
Surgery was performed at
the 3-month monitoring
visit following SRP. Subjects who had residual PDs]5
mm and bleeding on probing (BOP) received modified
Widman flap surgery at weekly intervals as needed.
Chlorhexidine, 0.1%, was used as a mouth rinse for
1 min twice daily during the surgical phase and 2 weeks
following the last surgical session.

Home care
Each subject was provided with a powered toothbrush
and triclosan-containing toothpaste and instructed to
brush twice daily and to perform daily interdental
cleaning with dental floss, toothpicks, and/or interdental
brushes.

Post-treatment care
At each follow-up visit,
the patients’ oral hygiene
standard was checked and reinforced when indicated.
Furthermore, at
the 12-month recall, all sites with

There were no significant baseline differences between patients who were in the control group (SRP) and those receiving other treatments
as evidenced by the large p-values.
Plus-minus values are means9standard deviations.
$Race was self-reported. Other races included Native Hawaiians, American Indian/Alaskan and unknown.

PD]5 mm and BOP were subjected to subgingival
mechanical debridement.

Clinical assessments
At each visit, visible plaque, gingivitis, BOP, suppuration,
probing depth, and CAL were recorded at four sites
per tooth (mesiobuccal, distobuccal, distolingual, and
mesiolingual). Full-mouth computations included only
approximal sites measuring]5 mm at baseline. At each
study visit, PD and CAL measurements were repeated
and the means of
the pairs of each measurement
were used to determine changes in these parameters.
A North Carolina periodontal probe
(Hu-Friedy,
Chicago, IL, USA) was used for PD and CAL recordings.
The same clinician did measurements at all visits for a
given subject, but the clinician making the measurements
did not perform treatment on that subject. Each clinician
examined or treated the same number of patients in each
group. The calibration of the performance of clinicians

was done as described by Haffajee et al. (10). Correlation
within examiner was 0.82 for PD and 0.78 for CAL and
between examiners pairwise correlations were 0.75 for PD
and 0.82 for CAL. Correlations between centers was
controlled by calibration sessions.

Data structure
Clinical parameters were measured at baseline and at
3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months for each tooth site with
PD]5 mm. The patients were at the highest level of the
structural data hierarchy (level 4), the 28 teeth excluding
the third molars in each patient were in level 3, and
level 2 comprised the four tooth sites. The bottom level
of the data hierarchy had the time variables at baseline
and the five monitoring time points. All the variables
indicating the units of analysis (level 2) and the clusters
of units (levels 3 and 4) were assumed to be random
factors in the analysis.

Multilevel modeling
We considered a four-level model with random intercept
and random effect of time on patients at level 3, random
intercept for teeth at level 2, and tooth sites at level 1. The
PD for any given patient at time t corresponding to the
baseline visit and the 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months visits on
site i, in tooth j nested within patient k denoted PDtijk, is
given by model 1:

a0k a1ktimet a0jk a0ijk otijk (random)
The parameter estimates b0 through to b13 represent fixed
effects associated with the intercept, time effect, treat-
ment, gender, age, race, nationality, smoking habits,
baseline PD, plaque accumulation, BOP, suppuration,
gingival redness, and the interaction of treatment with
time. For the random part, a0k and a1k represent the
patient random effect associated with the intercept and
time slope, respectively. a0jk is the random effect of a
tooth nested within a patient, a0ijk the random effect
of a site nested in a tooth, which in turn is nested in
patients, and otijk is the random error, which is assumed
to be homogeneous and uncorrelated with mean 0 and
variance s2.

The model parameter estimates were obtained in the
statistical software R using the restricted maximum
likelihood method (REML). We also considered a
similarly structured model for CAL loss.

A therapy that reduces PD by1.5 mm or results in
gain of CAL of 1.5 mm would be considered clinically
effective. Such binary response variables were also of
interest. The binary responses were modeled by logistic
multilevel regression given by model 2:

Ytijk is 1 if patient k at time t on site i nested in tooth

study. We considered a similarly
structured model for CAL gain of1.5 mm. These
generalized linear mixed models were estimated by
Laplace approximations through the lmer routine in R.

Results
Dropout rate of the US subjects (32% at the Forsyth
Institute, 24% at Boston University) was much greater
than in the Swedish material (7%). Those in the SURG
group dropped out more often than those receiving
antibiotics. During the active treatment phase, 25 teeth
were extracted, 41 during post-therapy monitoring.
SURG increased the number of extracted teeth whereas
systemic antibiotics gave reduced tooth loss. During
follow-up, 66 teeth were extracted in 48 subjects.

There were no significant baseline differences between
patients in the control group (SRP) and those receiving
other treatments (Table 1).

Pocket depth
Table 2 gives mean changes in PD for the effect of all
treatments over time when compared to SRP obtained by
fitting model 1. As expected, SURG was more effective in
PD reduction after 6 months but combining it with
systemic AMOX and MET gave better long-term clinical
improvement. Positive estimates represent mean PD
increase whereas negative estimates mean PD decrease
at various time points. For example, the estimated effect
of AMOXMETTET produced significant negative
estimates after 6 months, suggesting that patients treated
with AMOXMETTET had significant PD reduc-
tions over time compared to SRP. However, SURG
AMOXMETTET had larger significant estimates
in absolute terms after 6 months, suggesting that there
were more PD decrease for patients on this combination
therapy than for any other therapy across the study
period when compared to SRP.

Fig. S1 in the Appendix section is a plot of the mean
PD at each study time point. It shows that sites treated
with SURGAMOXMETTET had the least mean
PD while sites that were treated with SRP and TET had
the largest mean PD. A plot of the mean difference in PD
from the mean PD at the previous visit also shows similar
trends with SURGAMOXMETTET producing
the least PD (Fig. S3). In Fig. S2, sites that were treated
by SRP and with TET reverted to baseline conditions
after 6 months.

Fixed effects on PD
Table 3 shows the fixed effects on PD from fitting
model 1. The overall estimated effect of age on PD was
significant [0.01(0.01, 0.03)]. This means that, for every
year increase in age, the PD was expected to increase by
0.01 mm. However, the effects of gender and nationality
were not significant. The overall effect of site-level

covariates (accumulation of plaque, BOP, gingival red-
ness, and suppuration) on PD was highly significant.

Smoking habits
Both past [0.19 (0.02, 0.35)] and present [0.23 (0.08,
0.38)] smoking habits increased PD significantly by 0.19
and 0.23 mm, respectively.

We also fitted a model with a third-order interaction
between treatment, time, and smoking status in order
to investigate to what extent treatment effect varied
with smoking status (not shown). A significant third-
order interaction was found with regard to both PD and
CAL. This means that the effect of treatment on either
PD or CAL differed significantly between smokers and
non-smokers. The difference was clearly expressed for
the reference group (SRP), in favor of the non-smokers,
while for the other treatment groups, the difference was
somewhat smaller.

Pairwise treatment comparison on PD
We carried out a Tukey’s all-pairwise comparison of
the treatments on PD to establish those statistically
significant from each other at specific time points. The
results are given in Table S1 and include only compar-
isons that had significant outcome. After 3 months,
SURGTET were the least effective treatment when
compared to AMOXMET, TET, and SURG
AMOXMETTET. After 6 months, the effect of
SRP waned and the following therapies produced sig-
results when compared to SRP; SURG
nificant
AMOXMET, SURGTET, SURG, and SURG
AMOXMETTET, which were also significantly
effective when compared to TET. From the 12th months
visit through to the 24th months visit, the effectiveness
of all therapies leveled off (see also Fig. S1). After
12 months, SURGAMOXMETTET would be a
better choice than TET (pB0.01), better than SRP at
18 months (pB0.01), and at 24 months, it was better
than SRP and TET (pB0.01).

Decreases in PD of 1.5 mm
Table 4 and S2 show estimates obtained from the analysis
of model 2. The effectiveness of therapies including
SURG in reducing PD by 1.5 mm over time is clearly
seen in Table 4. SURG combined with AMOX, MET,
and TET was significantly more likely to achieve PD
reduction of 1.5 mm than any other therapy. The
odds of former smokers gaining on PD more than 1.5
mm was significantly reduced by 36% and was also
reduced significantly by 39% in patient who were smokers
compared to patients who had never smoked before.

CAL loss/gain

of all treatments over time when compared to SRP

Sites experienced significant reductions in mean PD and CAL over time. For each year increase in age, mean PD increased by 0.01 mm
and CAL also increased by 0.03 mm. Tooth site effects such as accumulation of plaque, bleeding on probing, suppuration and gingival
redness as well as smoking were all significant predictors of deeper pockets. Former smokers had pockets that were on average 0.19 mm
deeper than patients who had never smoked and those who were smoking had pockets that were on average 0.23 mm deeper than
patients who had never smoked before. Patients who suppurated had pockets that were 0.76 mm deeper than those who did not while
those who bled on probing had pockets that were 0.45 mm deeper than patients who did not bleed on probing.
On average, treated sites were expected to have a CAL gain of 0.87 mm after 3 months and only 0.53 mm after 24 months compared to
baseline conditions. Males and Swedish subjects experienced significant losses in CAL. Significant losses in CAL were also observed in
subjects who smoked. All tooth site effects which include accumulation of plaque, bleeding on probing, suppuration and gingival redness
increased mean CAL.
*Significant results at 0.05 when compared to SRP at baseline visit.

obtained by fitting model 1. Negative estimates imply
that there was gain of CAL and positive estimates
represent further loss of CAL. SURG increased further
loss of CAL compared to SRP at the 12-month visit.
Sites that were surgically treated had lost more CAL
than their baseline level conditions. However, when
combined with AMOXMETTET,
SURG was
significant gain of CAL was observed. AMOXMET
produced significant gain of CAL from the 6-month
visit.

In Fig. S4, sites that were treated with SURG
AMOXMET had the least mean loss in clinical
attachment. As shown in Fig. S5, only sites that had
been treated with AMOXMETTET, AMOXMET,
and SURGTET had slight gains in clinical attachment
compared to their baseline conditions after 6 months.

However, sites that were treated with AMOXMET
TET gained most on clinical attachment but SURG
treated sites gained less (Fig. S6).

Fixed effects on CAL
The fixed effects on CAL from fitting model 1 are shown
in Table 3. All tooth site-level covariates like visible
plaque, BOP, gingival redness, and suppuration produced
highly significant positive estimates, thus were strong
predictors for further loss of CAL. We did not find any
effect of past smoking on loss of CAL but current
smokers had higher risk of further loss of CAL.

However, we did not find other significant predictors,
which either reduced or increased chances of sites gaining
CAL by 1.5 mm in the logistic multilevel model (results
not shown).

Sites that had been surgically treated only (SURG) were 3.86 times more likely to gain 1.5 mm of PD after 6 months and 4.95 times more
likely to gain 1.5 mm of PD after 12 months compared to SRP. However, the odds ratios for antibiotics only were relatively smaller than the
odds ratios for SURG and SURG plus antibiotics. For example, the odds ratios for sites treated with AMOXMETTET were 2.36 and
2.35 after 6 and 12 months respectively when compared to SRP. On the other hand, sites treated with SURGAMOXMET were 5.47 and
7.77 times more likely to gain 1.5 mm of PD after 6 and 12 months respectively when compared to SRP after 3 months. We conclude that
at any point in time, these therapies were more likely to have PD reductions of more than 1.5 mm when compared to SRP at 3 months post
treatment.
All therapies were compared to SRP. Other fixed effects from the model are given in Table S1.
*Significant results at 0.05 compared to SRP.

Pairwise treatment comparison on CAL
We also carried out Tukey’s all-pairwise comparison of
the treatments on CAL and the results given in Table S3
include only comparisons that had significant outcomes.
After 3 months, sites that were treated with SURG
AMOXMET were on average 1.39 mm deeper than
sites that were treated with AMOXMETTET. Surgi-
cally treated sites were on average 1.31 mm deeper after
18 months and 1.26 mm deeper after 24 months
compared to sites that were treated with AMOX
METTET.

Discussion
A multilevel approach to study factors influencing the
outcome of periodontal treatment has been used pre-
viously (3639). The advantage of this approach over the
traditional methods of generalized linear models is that it
takes into account the relatedness of observations mea-
sured over time.

The results of the present study revealed that, for sites
with a baseline PD of at least 5 mm, SURG and any
therapy combined with SURG significantly reduced PD.
When combined with AMOX, MET, and TET, SURG
produced highly significant clinical benefits, which were
maintained throughout the 2-year study period. Our
results indicate that, if non-surgical therapies are to be
used in arresting periodontitis, then the best therapy
would be AMOXMETTET. These antibiotics must
be used as a combination therapy since using them on
their own does not produce long-lasting clinical benefits.
On the other hand, if surgical treatment is preferred, then
the best choice would be to combine SURG with AMOX,
MET, and TET. Actually,
this study revealed that

SURGAMOXMETTET produced more clinical
benefits than any other treatment. Also Goodson et al.
(35) found that AMOXMET provided CAL gain and
PD reduction.

We did not

find any effect of gender, race, or
nationality on PD. However, site level effects such as
baseline PD, accumulation of visible plaque, gingival
redness, BOP, and suppuration were significant predic-
tors of PD increase. The effect of past and present
smoking was also highly significant, and each year
increase in age was significantly associated with an
increase in PD.

In terms of CAL loss, major improvements in the
clinical parameters occurred from 6 months in subjects
who were treated with AMOXMETTET, AMOX
MET, and SURGAMOXMETTET. Sites from
patients who had been surgically treated experienced an
increase in CAL loss. This might be due to a detrimental
effect on osteoblasts through SURG. CAL loss was
common in all sites that had been surgically treated
only. Although SURG increased CAL loss, the effect
could be improved if SURG was combined with anti-
biotics. We concluded that combination therapies with
SURG were better than SURG at maintaining post-
treatment effects on attachment.

In the present study, we did not find the effect of race
and past smoking habits on loss of attachment in treated
patients although current smokers and males were at a
higher risk of CAL loss. This is in concordance with
previous observations that responses after periodontal
treatment are modified by cigarette smoking (2426).
However, accumulation of visible plaque, BOP, gingival

Modeling treatment effects on periodontitis

redness, and suppuration were significant predictors of
further CAL loss.

Our study revealed that sites of the Swedish subjects
experienced significant CAL loss after treatment com-
pared to sites of the American subjects. In a study of 79
Swedish and 79 US citizens with a healthy periodontium
or minimal periodontal disease, Haffajee et al. (40) found
differences in the subgingival microbiota of the two
populations. After adjusting for multiple comparisons
five species (Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, Strep-
tococcus sanguinis, Eikenella corrodens, Tannerella for-
sythia, and Prevotella melaninogenica) were more
abundant in the Swedish than in the American patients.
How the microbiota relates to clinical changes in the
present study groups remains to be investigated.

Periodontal diseases are common infections in man in
which the supporting tissues of
teeth are attacked
resulting in CAL loss. They are common even in
developed countries and a leading cause of tooth loss
(1). Despite the fact that different periodontal therapies
are being used, continued CAL loss is common in some
patients. The current study aimed to investigate the
maintenance over time of clinical effects after different
combinations of treatments of periodontitis. The major
objective was to find a treatment that could arrest
periodontal breakdown and maintain the beneficial
effects of treatment during a 2-year follow-up period.
We have shown that while standard periodontal treat-
ments such as SRP or SURG may improve periodontal
conditions,
the use of adjunctive systemic or local
antibiotic treatments would be a better choice especially
if used as combination therapies. If SURG is to be used,
it should be combined with AMOXMETTET to
maintain the best clinical results.

The present study is part of a series of studies in
modeling of infectious disease using periodontitis as basis
where we try to combine concepts and techniques from
different disciplines. The use of multilevel analysis is on
the frontier in periodontal research. However, available
software for analyzing such models sometimes gives
different results, and if the data are huge and depending
on the hierarchy of the model to be fitted, they tend to
converge slowly and in some cases never converge at all.
