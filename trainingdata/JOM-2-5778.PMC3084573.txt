Ã¦FOREWORD

SYSTEMIC DISEASE AND ORAL BACTERIA

Note from the Editor-in-Chief
Two major

topics of JOURNAL OF ORAL
MICROBIOLOGY are oral
infections and sys-
temic diseases. This thematic cluster of articles is
devoted entirely to these topics and their interplay. The
reason for this is that a relationship between oral
infections and systemic diseases has increasingly been
recognized over the past two decades. Systemic diseases
involved include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,
low
birth-weight pre-term babies, respiratory disease, and
several other conditions
such as osteoporosis and
rheumatoid arthritis. The oral diseases include, in parti-
cular, periodontal diseases.

Gregory J. Seymour, Dean, Faculty of Dentistry,
University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand, has been
invited to act as Guest Editor for this special issue since he
is very familiar with the oral infectionsystemic disease
relationship and has reported on it on several occasions.
He and his co-workers are greatly acknowledged for their
efforts to produce this collection of highly interesting
articles.
