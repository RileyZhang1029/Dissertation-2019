Such data is necessary, as predicted sites may serve as excellent starting locations for future omics studies to develop transcriptional regulation hypotheses.
In order to gen- erate this resource, we employed a phylogenetic footprinting approach  using sequence conserva- tion across cattle, human and dog  and position-speciﬁc scoring matrices to identify 379,333 putative TFBSs upstream of nearly 8000 Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) annotated genes within the cattle genome.
Comparisons of our predictions to known binding site loci within the PCK1, ACTA1 and G6PC promoter regions revealed 75% sensitivity for our method of discovery.
Additionally, we intersected our predictions with known cattle SNP variants in dbSNP and on the Illumina BovineHD 770k and Bos 1 SNP chips, ﬁnding 7534, 444 and 346 overlaps, respectively.
Due to our stringent ﬁltering criteria, these results represent high quality predictions of putative TFBSs within the cattle genome.

Introduction  The detection of functional transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) remains an elusive goal in the post-genome world [1].
Much of the difﬁculty in TFBS discovery comes from the short length of the sequencing reads as well as their degenerate nature.
Additionally, transcription factors (TFs) can often bind sequences completely dissimilar to their canonical TFBS motif and some TFBSs can be lineage-speciﬁc, thereby  * Corresponding author.

Given these difﬁculties, experimental discovery and annotation re- mains the most reliable method for TFBS discovery  however, such validation is often unavailable for individual TFs.
The proliferation of genome sequencing and assembly has made possible the use of comparative genomics approaches for TFBS discovery.
The reasoning behind the use of comparative genomics as a means of TFBS discovery is that conserved se- quence upstream of a gene is likely to contain essential TFBSs due to selective pressures to conserve the sequence across sev- eral different species [3].
Since TFs typically bind to non-cod- ing regions of the genome, accurate identiﬁcation of their binding sites could provide important context to the recent in- ﬂux of genetic variation discovery studies that often identify variants outside of coding regions.
In silico prediction methods for the detection of TFBSs can be classiﬁed by the order in which they apply sequence homol- ogy among several related species.

By contrast, phylogenetic footprinting uses con- served sequence alignments across several animal species as a starting point for TFBS motif detection [4].
Both techniques are subject to unique beneﬁts and disadvantages based on their starting approaches.
In our previous study, we identiﬁed novel TFBSs upstream of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK or PCK1) promoter and applied a TFBS prediction algorithm to detect TFBSs upstream of all genes available in the human genome [5].
In this study, we applied a phylogenetic footprinting approach using the transcription factor binding site locator (TFLOC) algorithm initially developed to detect conserved TFBSs within multiple genome alignments for the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser [6].
Implementation  TFLOC uses a position-speciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM) algo- rithm to identify putative TFBSs across multiple genome align- ment ﬁles through the generation of a similarity matrix score for each putative position [5].
The PSSMs that we used were derived from the JASPAR CORE, FAM and phyloFACTs databases, which contain freely available consensus TFBS scoring matrices that were experimentally determined or statis- tically predicted [7].
We chose the Btau4.0 reference assembly for our analysis for two reasons: (1) it is currently the most extensively-annotated cattle reference assembly and (2) simul- taneous comparative alignments against other mammalian genomes already exist for Btau4.0 (downloaded from: http:// hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/bosTau4/multiz5way/).
We chose the 1000 bp upstream multiple alignment ﬁle (maf) for our analysis as proximal TFBSs tend to be found within 1000 bp of the transcription start site (TSS) of a gene [8].
After downloading the 1000 bp maf from the UCSC genome brow- ser, we removed alignments from Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) and mouse (Mus musculus) due to their large se- quence divergences from cattle (Bos taurus).
Unfortunately, promoter sequence for similar genes could not be found within the genomes of some animals.
For example, platypus and mouse only shared promoter sequence synteny with cattle 1437 times (1437/8740  16%) and 7649 times (7649/8740  88%), respectively, compared to 8440 times (97%) for human (Homo sapiens) and 8165 times (93%) for dog (Canis lupus familiaris).
By focusing on multiple alignments containing se- quences only from cattle, human and dog, we were able to investigate 7764 locations that had homology among three  species as opposed to only 1335 locations if we included align- ments that contained sequences from all ﬁve species.
Application  Computational TFBS prediction methods are often marred by high false positive rates (FPRs), so we initially sought to deﬁne stringent ﬁlters for the algorithm in order to focus on highly- likely TFBS motifs.
Similar to Liu et al.
s approach [5], we tested the ﬁt of raw TFLOC prediction scores for all surveyed PSSMs to a Gaussian distribution and found that 176 out of 315 of the motifs (55.9%) had signiﬁcant deviations from a standard distribution.
We also identiﬁed 8 different distribu- tion types for TFLOC prediction scores, similar again to the previous report [5].
For all subsequent predictions, we consid- ered non-Gaussian distributions of TFLOC scores by using ﬁne-tuned ﬁltering values for each PSSM.
The ﬁnal ﬁlter val- ues were derived from an empirical test consisting of compar- isons between well-characterized TFBSs identiﬁed within the PCK1, ACTA1 and G6PC promoters and TFLOC predictions.
To estimate the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of our predictions, we sought to use these promoter regions with relatively high numbers of coordinate-converted TFBS positions.
If we in- clude promoter regions with fewer characterized TFBS posi- tions, the speciﬁcity estimation could be artiﬁcially penalized due to a lack of experimental TFBS information rather than a real ﬂaw in our algorithm.
Based on 44 characterized sites upstream of the human PCK1, ACTA1 and G6PC genes that could be converted to Btau4.0 reference coordinates using the liftOver tool [9] as a standard [10 13], we measured the overlap of predictions at incremental cutoff values (Table 1).
We deﬁned sensitivity as the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives in addition to the false nega- tives.
Speciﬁcity was deﬁned as the percentage of predictions that overlapped known sites by at least 50%, similar to the cri- terion described previously [5].
A cutoff value of 0.04% was chosen for future TFBS predictions as it produced superior sensitivity and speciﬁcity while making fewer overall predic- tions than the higher cutoff values (Figure 1).
While it is very likely that some TFBSs with in vivo activity may have been ex- cluded due to this stringent ﬁlter, our analysis focused on puta- tive, high percent similarity binding sites that likely have functional signiﬁcance due to their conservation across species.
We also compared TFBS detection results from our method to results from another phylogenetic footprinting tool, Mul- tiTF [14].
Using the same 1 kb upstream regions from PCK1, ACTA1 and G6PC, we aligned the sequences with the Mulan webtool (http://mulan.dcode.org/) and loaded the alignments  Table 1 Performance of TFLOC predictions at various score thresholds  Known sites Predicted sites False negatives 50% Overlapping predictions Total predictions Sensitivity (%) Speciﬁcity (%)  Threshold ( 0.01%)  MultiTF  1  44 24 20 24 93 55 25  2  44 31 13 40 179 70 22  3  44 32 12 66 284 72 23  4  44 33 11 78 359 75 22  5  44 33 11 81 416 75 20  6  44 33 11 84 452 75 19  44 29 15 88 215 66 41   Bickhart DM and Liu GE / TFBS Prediction in the Cattle Genome  197  Figure 1 Comparison of known and predicted sites upstream of the PCK1 locus on the Btau4.0 reference assembly The chromosome position (Chr13: 59,379,179 59,379,654) is listed at the top of the diagram, with vertical gray bars serving as scale bar markers.

in MultiTF for TFBS detection using the default settings.
Only 29 of the 44 known TFBSs in the three genes were detected by MultiTF (66% sensitivity) compared to the 33 sites identiﬁed in our method (75% sensitivity).
Both methods made a similar number of predictions within the analyzed regions (361 predic- tions for MultiTF and 359 for TFLOC).
Therefore, differences in predicted sites may be attributed to the use of different TFBS PSSMs, as our method used the JASPAR databases [7], while MultiTF uses the TRANSFAC database [15].
Although both methods provide high degrees of sensitivity for TFBS detection in promoter regions, TFLOC was able to detect the 0.04% cutoff ﬁlter than MultiTF.
four more experimentally-validated TFBSs at  Our analysis predicted 379,333 TFBSs upstream of 7764 MGC annotated loci within the Btau4.0 reference assembly.
Many of the placed MGC annotations (683 loci) on Btau4.0 lacked sequence conservation in either dog or in human, so we were unable to predict TFBSs in these regions.
Another portion of MGC upstream alignments (293 loci) were removed as the up- stream region fell within gap or repeat regions of the Btau4.0 assembly.
Despite these losses, we were able to predict TFBSs at  80% (7764 out of 9706) of the currently-annotated MGC loci in the Btau4.0 assembly and  89% (7764 out of 8740) of the MGC loci present in the maf alignment.
We then checked for previously-annotated variants that might overlap with our predictions by comparing our TFBS loci with the 9 million plus SNP variant calls within the cattle genome that are present in the dbSNP variant (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ projects/SNP/) [16].
Since the variants present in dbSNP have  repository  coordinates on the UMD3.1 reference assembly, we used the UCSC s liftOver tool to convert the SNP coordinates to the Btau4.0 assembly ( 98% conversion rate).
We identiﬁed 7534 TFBS predictions that overlapped with variant SNP loci (Table S1).
We also compared our TFBS loci with SNPs present on the Illumina BovineHD 770k and Affymetrix Bos 1 SNP chips and identiﬁed 444 and 346 intersections, respectively.
Gi- ven the potential for SNP variants to cause changes within the sequences of TFBSs and theoretically impact the binding afﬁn- ities of TFs, we counted the number of SNP TFBS intersections that were within conserved nucleotides (monomorphic) of the TFBS consensus sequence (Table S1).
We found a high number of SNP TFBS intersections that changed conserved TFBS consensus sequences (5598 in dbSNP  243 in Bos 1 and 327 in BovineHD 770k).
These SNP TFBS intersections were also identiﬁed upstream of 1887 MGC annotated genes.
Several of these overlaps occurred upstream of essential genes, such as the CTCF binding site of HLA-DMA (encoding histocompati- bility antigen, DM alpha chain), the NKX3_1 binding site of LYZ1 (encoding lysozyme) and the FOXF2 binding site of HSP40/DNAJB4 (encoding heat shock protein 40/DnaJ homo- log, subfamily B, member 4).
Conclusion  In this study, we identiﬁed 379,333 putative transcription fac- tor binding sites (TFBSs) within the promoter regions of 7764 annotated genes in the cattle genome.
Intersections of known   198  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 195 198  SNP sites from dbSNP (5598 sites), the Bos 1 array (243 sites) and the BovineHD 770k array (327 sites) with our predicted TFBSs revealed interesting overlaps.
It is feasible that future GWAS, QTL mapping and whole genome sequencing studies are able to investigate our identiﬁed SNP TFBS intersections to link variants within our TFBS predictions to phenotypes.
Currently, our predictions represent high priority regions of interest for future surveys such as RNA-seq, which can tag dif- ferences of expression with animal genotypes.
