Microbial Fe(II) oxidation using NO

Fe(II) oxidation, NDFO] has been studied for over 15 years. Although there are reports

−
are known organotrophic NO
3 -reducers that require the presence of an organic, primary
substrate, e.g., acetate, for signiﬁcant amounts of Fe(II) oxidation. Although the thermo-

2 reduction,
−
the kinetics of abiotic Fe(II) oxidation by NO
3 are relatively slow except under special
conditions. NDFO is typically studied in batch cultures containing millimolar concentra-

tions of Fe(II), NO
2 is often observed
−
to accumulate in culture media during Fe(II) oxidation. Compared to NO
3 , abiotic reac-
−
tions of biogenic NO
2 and Fe(II) are relatively rapid. The kinetics and reaction pathways
−
of Fe(II) oxidation by NO
2 are strongly affected by medium composition and pH, reactant
concentration, and the presence of Fe(II)-sorptive surfaces, e.g., Fe(III) oxyhydroxides and
cellular surfaces. In batch cultures, the combination of abiotic and microbial Fe(II) oxidation
can alter product distribution and, more importantly, results in the formation of intracellular
precipitates and extracellular Fe(III) oxyhydroxide encrustations that apparently limit further
cell growth and Fe(II) oxidation. Unless steps are taken to minimize or account for poten-
tial abiotic reactions, results of microbial NDFO studies can be obfuscated by artifacts of
the chosen experimental conditions, the use of inappropriate analytical methods, and the
resulting uncertainties about the relative importance of abiotic and microbial reactions. In

this manuscript, abiotic reactions of NO
solid-phase Fe(II) are reviewed along with factors that can inﬂuence overall NDFO reaction
rates in microbial systems. In addition, the use of low substrate concentrations, continuous-
ﬂow systems, and experimental protocols that minimize experimental artifacts and reduce
the potential for under- or overestimation of microbial NDFO rates are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
To state the obvious, some geomicrobiological systems are eas-
ier to work with than others. In the same way that microbial,
microaerophilic Fe(II) oxidation at circumneutral pH presents
experimental challenges (Emerson and Floyd, 2005) microbial
−
NO
3 -dependent Fe(II) oxidation (NDFO) present a variety of
complexities that can complicate experimental design and con-
fuse interpretation of results. Fe(II) is usually initially provided
as soluble Fe2+
, but can also be introduced as sorbed Fe(II)
or Fe(II)-bearing minerals of varying crystallinity and reactiv-
ity. The oxidized Fe(III) produced precipitates rapidly at cir-
cumneutral pH forming oxyhydroxides, thereby providing highly
sorptive and reactive surfaces not initially present and fre-
quently forming extensive cell coatings which can strongly effect
microbial metabolism. Although usually not measured, the ﬁnal
product of NO
reduction, based on stoichiometry and lack
+
of NH
4 production, is typically assumed to be N2 or N2O.

Rather than present new data, this manuscript will review
−
potential abiotic reactions between either NO
2 and
homogeneous solutions of Fe2+
or heterogeneous systems con-
taining solid-phase Fe(II). Numerous studies have been conducted
for more than four decades (e.g., Chao and Kroontje, 1966), often
under signiﬁcantly different experimental conditions and result-
ing in varying reports of reactivity, reaction rates, and disparate
distributions of products. This manuscript will describe previ-
ous abiotic studies in the context of microbial NDFO, attempt
to provide deeper insights into the potential for simultaneous
abiotic and biotic reactions of Fe and N, and assist in inter-
preting relative contributions of both reaction types in studies
of microbial NDFO.

Calculations based on commonly used thermodynamic data
(Stumm and Morgan, 1981) show that the standard free energy
change at pH 7 for all reactions is favorable. Even though the
thermodynamics are favorable, the kinetics of abiotic aqueous
−
Fe2+
oxidation by NO
3 at circumneutral pH in the absence of
catalytic ions or surfaces are relatively slow. With respect to cat-
alysts for abiotic reactions, Cu2+
and other metal ions have been
shown to increase reaction rates (Buresh and Moraghan, 1976;
Ottley et al., 1997). In an oft-cited study, Buresh and Moraghan
−
(1976) described the oxidation of aqueous Fe2+
3 over a
pH range of 6–10 in the presence of 0–160 μM Cu2+
as a catalyst.
−
In the presence of 0.0 and 1.6 μM Cu2+
, NO
3 was stable over the
24-h experiment regardless of the pH. In the presence of Cu2+
−
at concentrations of 16 μM or greater, NO
3 reduction occurred,
and the extent of reduction increased with pH, becoming quite
−
signiﬁcant at pH 8 and above. When Cu-catalyzed NO
3 reduc-
tion occurred, Fe(OH)2 or other solid phases were presumed to
be the reducing agents rather than soluble Fe2+
due to increased
−
3 reduction at pH values >7 where extensive production of
NO
solid-phase Fe occurred. Ottley et al. (1997) further examined
in the presence of 7 μM to 7 mM
the reduction of NO
Cu2+
and other trace metal ions at pH 7–8.5. Relatively rapid

again increased at
alkaline pH and the authors determined that solid-phase Cu pro-
duced during incubations was catalytically active rather than the
soluble Cu2+
Solid-phase Fe(II), whether adsorbed or crystalline, has been
shown to be a more effective reductant than aqueous Fe2+
for
reactions involving both organic and inorganic compounds (Sung
and Morgan, 1980; Tamura et al., 1980; Klausen et al., 1995; Cui
and Eriksen, 1996; Kim and Picardal, 1999; Amonette et al., 2000;
Williams et al., 2005; Neumann et al., 2009). The importance of
−
solid-phase or adsorbed Fe(II) in the abiotic reduction of NO

appears to be dependent upon the time scale of the studies, pH, and
characteristics of the solid phase. Postma (1990) studied reduction

cate minerals at pH 2–7 over periods of 1000–2000 h. No aqueous

all NO
3 reduction rates were quite low, however, and reduction
by Fe(II)-bearing silicate minerals was considered to be important
only in groundwater systems with long residence times. Although
the Postma study may have signiﬁcance for microbial NDFO as an
environmental process in suitable sediments, the acidic pH regime

3 and Fe2+
and low micromolar concentrations of NO
used in his
studies make it difﬁcult to extrapolate his ﬁndings to laboratory
studies of microbial NDFO.

In the work of Ottley et al. (1997), weeklong incubations of
−
3 and initially aqueous Fe2+
NO
in the absence of metal ion cat-
−
alysts at pH 8 showed a 15% NO
3 loss. Such losses would be
important in microbial experiments where incubations are often
conducted over similar or longer time scales. Since such losses of
−
NO
3 are typically not observed in microbiological experiments
with aqueous Fe2+
(Straub et al., 1996; Weber et al., 2001; Blothe
and Roden, 2009), it is not clear if trace amounts of O2 caused

3 reduction by sorbed
oxidation and subsequent NO
or solid-phase Fe(II). As also described by Ottley et al. addition

reduction. Since goethite is sometimes a product of microbial
NDFO (described below), this shows the potential importance
of solid phases and suggests that sorption of Fe2+
to some Fe(III)
−
oxyhydroxides may increase abiotic NO
3 reduction rates.
−
Petersen (1979) described the abiotic oxidation of NO
3 by
Fe2+
over a pH range of 4–9. Reaction rates were very slow at pH
≤6 and maximal at pH 8. Petersen suggested that the reductant
was a colloidal form of Fe(OH)2 which began to precipitate at
pH 6. Although Petersen’s experiments were conducted at 70˚C
and should be carefully considered when working with hyperther-
mophiles, the applicability of his results to microbial experiments
typically done at much lower temperatures is questionable.

NH
4 at temperature (3–41˚C), pH (5.45–7.45), and concentration
regimes appropriate to microbial studies (Rakshit et al., 2005).
−
In addition, clear evidence of rapid abiotic reduction of NO
3
by green rust (GR) minerals has been provided by Hansen and
coworkers (Hansen et al., 1994, 1996, 2001) and others (Choi and
Batchelor, 2008). The GRs are highly reactive and consist of tri-
octahedral Fe(II)–Fe(III) hydroxide layers separated by hydrated
anionic interlayers. The anions in the GR interlayer are variable,
e.g., sulfate in GRSO4 or chloride in GRCl. Both GRSO4 and GRCl
+
have been shown to abiotically reduce NO
4 during oxi-
dation of the GR to magnetite (Hansen et al., 1996, 2001). The
kinetics of these reactions at circumneutral and slightly alkaline
pH are sufﬁciently rapid to provide a competing pathway for
−
microbial NO
3 reduction when GR is present at sufﬁciently high
concentrations.
Considering all of the above studies, several generalities are pos-
−
sible. Firstly, Fe2+
3 are generally stable at circumneutral
and NO
pH over the time scale used in most microbial NDFO experiments.
This is quite apparent in the killed-cell or uninoculated controls
typically used in NDFO batch experiments (Straub et al., 1996;
Weber et al., 2001, 2006a; Kappler et al., 2005). In addition, both

Abiotic and microbial interactions

instead of Fe2+
(Kumaraswamy et al., 2006; Chakraborty et al.,
2011). Although catalysis by Cu2+
and other trace metal ions may
have importance in some natural, sedimentary environments, such
catalyzed reactions will likely be unimportant in the culture media
commonly used in laboratory NDFO experiments. Trace metal
solutions used in anaerobic studies (Stra˛po´c et al., 2008; Wolfe
et al., 2011) typically result in ﬁnal Cu2+
concentrations more
than one to two orders-of-magnitude less than the lowest effective
catalytic concentration found in the above studies.
−
Solid-phase or adsorbed Fe(II) may reduce NO
3 in some cases,
but the effectiveness of the reductant is largely determined by the
pH and the identity of the solid phase. The ability of the solid phase
−
to function as a catalyst for NO
3 reduction may also be dependent
on the simultaneous presence of Fe2+
. In controls without supple-
mental Fe2+
using pasteurized, microbially reduced goethite, and
−
other Fe(II)-bearing solid phases, concomitant losses of NO
3 and
Fe(II) were not observed (Weber et al., 2001; Chakraborty et al.,
2011). GR minerals are effective reductants, especially at slightly
alkaline pH, and their transient formation in experimental systems
used in microbial NDFO experiments should always be consid-
ered. The usual method of GR synthesis involves either controlled
oxidation of aqueous FeCl2 or FeSO4 (Tamaura et al., 1984b), the
same compounds often used to study microbial Fe2+
oxidation, or
an “induced hydrolysis” method involving reaction of Fe2+
with
HFO in a pH 7, carbonate-buffered system (Hansen, 1989). In
addition, GR-like minerals may also be transiently formed during
conversion of other Fe(III) oxyhydroxides, e.g., lepidocrocite, to
magnetite during incubation with Fe2+
(Tamaura et al., 1984a;
Sørensen and Thorling, 1991). Since similar conditions needed
for GR synthesis may exist during microbial NDFO studies, tran-
sient formation of minor GR-containing phases during microbial
experiments must be taken into consideration. Typical uninoc-
ulated or killed-cell controls would not be suitable controls for
a possible abiotic GR reaction since GR synthesis from aqueous
Fe2+

requires Fe2+
The Fe(III) mineral phases that form as products are often
poorly crystalline and their mineralogy can be determined by fac-
tors such as pH, phosphate, or bicarbonate concentrations used
in the culture media, rates of Fe(II) oxidation, presence of humic
compounds or other ligands, and other factors. In cases where
mineral identity has been characterized, end-products such as
goethite, lepidocrocite, HFO, or Fe(III) phosphates are usually
identiﬁed (Lack et al., 2002; Kappler et al., 2005; Senko et al.,
2005; Miot et al., 2009; Larese-Casanova et al., 2010). Early work
included one report of formation of GR and magnetite (Chaud-
huri et al., 2001), but later work by the same authors using the
same culture and media found formation of HFO with no evi-
dence of GR formation (Lack et al., 2002). The authors attributed
the disparate ﬁnding to differences in the rate of Fe(II) oxidation
by variously treated cultures. Clear evidence of GR formation dur-
ing Fe(II) oxidation by Acidovorax sp. strain BoFeN1 was recently
reported (Pantke et al., 2012) and the relative contribution of enzy-

only 4% of 3.6 mM NO
2 remained after 24 h incubation with
25 mM Fe2+
at pH 5. It is not clear, however, if air was excluded
from their reaction system. Moraghan and Buresh (1977) con-
ducted experiments with 14 mM Fe2+

and found complete removal of 1.8 mM NO
2 after 24 h at pH
8 with N2O as the primary product. At pH 6, only 12% of the

NO
2 was reduced during the same period, although the pres-
ence of Cu2+
dramatically increased reaction rates. Since Fe(III)
oxyhydroxide precipitates formed during their studies, the role of
heterogeneous reactions could not be deﬁnitively ascertained. Van

is enhanced by the presence of solid phases. Van
Cleemput and Baert (1983) reported that the addition of amor-

greatly accelerated rates of reaction compared to systems con-
taining Fe2+

systems was especially pronounced at pH 6 and 8 where rates of

over a pH range of 6–8.5 under anoxic conditions. Rates of reduc-

tion of NO
2 , primarily to N2O, occurred much more rapidly in
the presence of lepidocrocite than in its absence and increased pro-
gressively from pH 7.5 to 8.5. Fe2+
reacted with the solid phase to
form magnetite (Fe3O4) and the authors suggest that a transient
GR phase may have formed at pH 8 and above during magnetite
formation. Sorption of Fe2+
to goethite was also found by Coby
−
and Picardal (2005) to increase reduction of NO
2 to N2O at pH
7 compared to systems lacking goethite.
−
The ability of GRSO4 to reduce NO
2 has been shown by Hansen
−
et al. (1994) who proposed that NO
2 can be both reduced rapidly
during GR formation and more slowly by Fe(II) in the GR lat-
tice. In a recent report by Kampschreur et al. (2011), reduction of
−
2 to NO and N2O by Fe2+
NO
at pH 5.6–7.6 was attributed both
to reaction with aqueous Fe2+
and the transient formation of GR-
like compounds although a characterization was not done of the
solid-phase formed during the reaction. With the exception of a
recent report (Pantke et al., 2012) as described above, GR minerals
are typically not found as ﬁnal products during microbial NDFO
exists in spite of conditions, i.e., presence of Fe2+
and freshly pre-
cipitated Fe(III) oxyhydroxides (Hansen, 1989), that may favor
transient appearance during reaction progress.
In addition to reactions with GR and Fe2+

sorbed to Fe(III)
−
oxyhydroxides, other studies have shown abiotic reactions of NO
2
with various forms of solid-phase Fe(II). Weber et al. (2001)
−
demonstrated that NO
2 can abiotically oxidize Fe(II) in micro-
bially reduced goethite and subsoils in addition to biogenic mag-
netite. In their experiments, neither biogenic nor chemically pre-
−
cipitated siderite (FeCO3) was abiotically oxidized by NO
2 . This
contrasts with the subsequent experiments of Rakshit et al. (2008)
−
who demonstrated abiotic reduction of NO
2 to N2O by chemi-
cally precipitated siderite at increasing rates as the pH was reduced
from 7.9 to 5.5. In a separate study, Rakshit et al. (2005) also

showed that wüstite (FeO) was able to reduce NO

signiﬁcantly greater than corresponding NO

NO
2 may also be reactive with Fe(II)-EDTA although results

are equivocal. In 6-day, abiotic experiments with 2.5 mM NO

compound were observed (Chakraborty and Picardal, unpub-
lished data). In the experiments of Kumaraswamy et al. (2006) at
the same pH, however, 18% of 10 mM Fe(II)-EDTA was oxidized
−
after 24 h. The greater reactivity of NO
2 has also been highlighted
in studies (Cooper et al., 2003; Coby and Picardal, 2005) which
−
described abiotic reactions between NO
2 and Fe(II) sorbed to
microbial cell surfaces. The products of this reaction were N2O and

subsequent transport of soluble substrates into cells.

A uniﬁed and comprehensive understanding of abiotic reac-

sometimes conﬂicting results in some of the above studies, likely
due to the wide range of reactant concentrations (micromolar to
tens of millimolar), different pH regimes, varying experimental

Fe speciation, potential transient formation of reactive species

POTENTIAL ABIOTIC INTERACTIONS
Nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation was ﬁrst described by Straub
et al. (1996) and is catalyzed by phylogenetically diverse bacte-
ria in a variety of environments (Hafenbradl et al., 1996; Benz
et al., 1998; Straub and Buchholz-Cleven, 1998; Straub et al.,
2004; Kumaraswamy et al., 2006; Muehe et al., 2009; Weber et al.,
2009). NDFO has been demonstrated in a variety of sediment
enrichments, microbial consortia, and pure cultures, including
both autotrophic and mixotrophic cultures. In addition to the
autotrophic enrichment culture originally described by Straub
et al. (1996), autotrophic growth has been reported for Pseudogul-
benkiania sp. Strain 2002 (Weber et al., 2006a, 2009), Paracoccus
ferrooxidans using organically complexed Fe(II) (Kumaraswamy
et al., 2006), and a hyperthermophilic archaeum (Hafenbradl
et al., 1996). Most pure cultures capable of NDFO, however, are

organotrophic, NO

presence of an organic cosubstrate such as acetate, either cometa-
bolically or through a mixotrophic physiology. Examples of such
bacteria include Paracoccus denitriﬁcans (Muehe et al., 2009), vari-
ous Acidovorax sp. (Straub et al., 2004; Kappler et al., 2005; Muehe
et al., 2009; Byrne-Bailey et al., 2010; Chakraborty et al., 2011),

bers of the α-, β-, γ-, and δ-subgroups of the Proteobacteria in
addition to Gram-positive bacteria (Straub and Buchholz-Cleven,

Fe(II) oxidation by mixotrophic organisms may be linked
to energy conservation and growth or, in some cases, result
from a summation of both enzymatic reactions and abiotic side
reactions that occur fortuitously during organotrophic growth.
Fe(II)-oxidation-enhanced growth has been clearly shown during
mixotrophic growth by some Acidovorax sp. In experiments with
two different Acidovorax isolates (Muehe et al., 2009; Chakraborty
et al., 2011), increases in growth yield in batch cultures using
−
4–10 mM Fe2+
3 , and 1.5–5 mM acetate were con-
sistently greater in the presence of Fe2+
than in its absence. In the
experiments of Chakraborty et al. growth typically ceased after sev-
eral days, regardless of the presence of remaining substrate, likely
as a result of Fe(III) oxyhydroxide coatings that develop on cells.
When Fe(II)-EDTA was used instead of Fe2+
in their experiments,
oxyhydroxide encrustations did not form and further additions
of substrate could be utilized. In a continuous-ﬂow system using
−
50–250 μM Fe2+
, 100 μM NO
3 , and 20 μM acetate, they did not
observe formation of cell encrustations and cell growth was sus-
tained over a 14-day period rather than the 3–4 days observed
using higher concentrations in batch cultures. Overall, it is clear
that NDFO can enhance growth of some mixotrophic Fe(II) oxi-
dizers and that the formation of cell encrustations in batch systems
at millimolar substrate concentrations can limit growth and sub-
strate utilization. These cell encrustations are commonly observed

Abiotic and microbial interactions

during NDFO in batch culture and their characterization has
received detailed scrutiny (Kappler et al., 2005, 2010; Miot et al.,
2009; Schädler et al., 2009).

Although it is clear that NDFO is a biological process that can
increase growth yields in some bacteria, the possibilities of abi-
otic reactions between Fe(II) and oxidized N species during the
course of batch NDFO studies requires that experimenters con-
sider both biotic and abiotic mechanisms when evaluating results.
This is particularly important since typical abiotic controls in
such experiments do not effectively mimic the changing aque-
ous and solid-phase chemical conditions that occur in live-culture
replicates. Uninoculated or killed-cell controls in microbiological
NDFO experiments typically consist of anoxic bottles containing
culture medium components, ferrous iron (usually aqueous Fe2+
)
−
and NO
3 (Straub et al., 1996; Weber et al., 2001). Controls of this

type have established that NO
or
the solid-phase Fe(II) initially added over the time period used in
typical experiments.

−
2 .

Such controls, however, do not contain the freshly precipitated
Fe(III) oxyhydroxides that form in live-culture replicates. These
materials likely include a spectrum of metastable oxyhydroxides
of unknown mineralogy that are able to sorb Fe2+
from the aque-
ous phase and which are subject to continuing phase changes over
the course of the experiment. The ﬁnal phases formed will be a
function of the solution chemistry, buffer choice, Fe2+
concentra-
tion, and Fe(II) oxidation rate. Although the predominant mineral
phases present at the conclusion of the experiment have been char-
acterized in a number of studies (Lack et al., 2002; Kappler et al.,
2005; Miot et al., 2009), these identiﬁed phases represent a “snap-
shot” at a particular time and may also not capture highly reactive
minor phases. Such reactive phases, especially in the presence of
the 5- to 10-mM Fe2+
concentrations used in typical batch exper-
−
iments, may lead to limited abiotic reactions with NO
3 and, to a
greater extent, with biogenic NO

−
The accumulation of NO
2 in live cultures can potentially be
−
more problematic than NO
3 in producing abiotic artifacts due
to greater possibility of reactions with Fe2+
sorbed to cellular
materials or biogenic Fe(III) oxyhydroxides.The accumulation of
−
0.5–1.5 mM NO
2 in NDFO batch cultures has been noted in sev-
eral studies (Kappler et al., 2005; Larese-Casanova et al., 2010;
−
Chakraborty et al., 2011). This NO
2 accumulation did not occur
during organotrophic growth with acetate and often coincides
with Fe2+
oxidation. In some studies, controls have been used
to attempt to discount the contribution of abiotic Fe(II) oxidation
−
by NO
2 . These controls contained NO
(Kappler et al., 2005) or solid-phase Fe(II) (Weber et al., 2001),
but not both. Since the abiotic studies described above have shown
that NO
sorbed to Fe-containing minerals,
controls lacking both a Fe(III) oxyhydroxide and millimolar Fe2+
concentrations are not truly representative of conditions present
in live cultures and may underestimate abiotic reaction kinetics.
It is therefore currently difﬁcult to accurately ascertain the rela-
tive contributions of abiotic and biotic reaction pathways in most
studies where NO

−
2 accumulates in batch culture media.

−
The reason why NO
2 accumulates in mixotrophic, Fe(II)-
oxidizing batch cultures but not
growing
organotrophically is also subject to speculation. One possibility

−
2 and either soluble Fe2+

−
2 can react with Fe2+

in cultures

is that electrons from Fe(II) enter the respiratory electron trans-
port chain at a branch point where electron transport is possible
−
−
2 . Alternately, Fe2+
to NO
could diffuse into the
3 but not to NO
−
periplasm and sorb to a periplasmic NO
2 reductase. Since studies
−
have shown that Fe2+
sorbed to cellular material can reduce NO
(Coby and Picardal, 2005), abiotic oxidation of the sorbed Fe2+
2
−
2 could result in accumulation of Fe(III)-mineral
by biogenic NO
−
precipitates on the NO
2 reductase and in the periplasm. Periplas-
mic accumulations of Fe(III) minerals have indeed been observed
(Miot et al., 2009, 2011; Schädler et al., 2009). Although it is not
clear if these periplasmic mineral accumulations are the result of
abiotic or enzymatic Fe2+
oxidation, the recent observation (Miot
et al., 2011) of mineralized protein globules in the periplasm and
outer face of the plasma membrane supports the hypothesis that
−
NO
2 accumulation in Fe(II)-oxidizing cultures results from inhi-
bition of the nitrite reductase by mineral deposition. Ultimately,
very little is deﬁnitively known at the current time about mech-
anisms of microbial NDFO and the location of Fe(II) oxidation.
−
The demonstration of NO
3 -dependent oxidation of solid-phase
Fe(II) (Weber et al., 2001), however, strongly suggests that phys-
iological oxidation takes place outside the cell since solid-phase
Fe(II) is unlikely to enter cells.

Although alternate mechanisms governing production of min-
eral cell encrustations during mixotrophic NDFO have been pro-
posed (Kappler and Newman, 2004; Kappler et al., 2005; Schädler
et al., 2009), the sorption of Fe2+
to cell surfaces in media con-
−
taining NO
2 is sufﬁcient for abiotic cell encrustation by Fe(III)
oxyhydroxides (Coby and Picardal, 2005). When Fe(II)-EDTA
was used in batch cultures instead of Fe2+
in the studies of
Chakraborty et al. (2011) encrusted cells did not develop and uti-
lization of additional amendments of soluble substrate was not
−
blocked, even though >1 mM NO
2 accumulated . In continuous-
ﬂow systems in which advective transport and low-micromolar

lation, they observed no signiﬁcant cell encrustations. Lack of
encrustations in continuous-ﬂow systems may also be a result of
advective removal of nanoscale Fe(III) oxide precipitates before
they have an opportunity to aggregate and accumulate on cells.

−
3 concentrations prevent NO

, acetate, and NO

The use of such continuous-ﬂow systems may be helpful in
establishing whether Fe(II)-oxidation can be coupled to energy
conservation and growth in other isolates. Since measurements of
substrate conversion are problematic in a continuous-ﬂow system
operated at low micromolar substrate concentrations (described
in Chakraborty et al., 2011), batch systems are still likely required
to examine reaction stoichiometry and achieve a mass balance
of reactants and products. In such cases, reducing concentrations
of one or all substrates may lower abiotic reaction rates relative
−
to microbial rates, reduce NO
2 accumulation, and thereby min-
imize development of cell encrustations. Alternately, it may be
possible to develop opposing-gradient culture systems based on
those used to study microaerophilic Fe(II) oxidation (Emerson
and Floyd, 2005). Additional studies are needed to determine if
such approaches are useful alternatives to the use of 5–10 mM

CONCLUSION
Although the focus of this paper has been on potential abiotic reac-
−
tions between Fe(II) and NO
2 , it should be emphasized
that the microbial oxidation of Fe(II) can clearly be enzymatically
catalyzed by microorganisms and conservation of energy from
the reaction can, at least in some cases, be coupled to growth.
Microaerobic Fe(II) oxidizers active at circumneutral pH must
compete with the abiotic oxidation of Fe(II) by O2 and potential
Fe(III) oxide encrustations by specializing in environments, e.g., at

oxic:anoxic boundaries with low substrate concentrations, where
abiotic reactions are not overly detrimental (Emerson, 2000).
−
Likely to a lesser extent, NO
3 -dependent Fe(II) oxidizers must
similarly exist in natural aquatic systems in a deﬁned environ-
mental milieu or substrate concentration regime where abiotic and
biotic reactions can coexist, inhibitory accumulations of mineral
−
encrustations do not form, and NO
2 accumulations are mini-
mized. These environments certainly differ from the “unnatural”
conditions used in most batch studies. As in microaerobic systems,
although possibly to a lesser extent, experimenters will need to deal
with special challenges that arise from the potential abiotic reac-
tions when designing experiments and interpreting experimental
results.
