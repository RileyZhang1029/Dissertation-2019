Under anoxic conditions in sediments, acetogens are often thought to be outcompeted
by microorganisms performing energetically more favorable metabolic pathways, such as
sulfate reduction or methanogenesis. Recent evidence from deep subseaﬂoor sediments
suggesting acetogenesis in the presence of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis has
called this notion into question, however. Here I argue that acetogens can successfully
coexist with sulfate reducers and methanogens for multiple reasons. These include (1)
substantial energy yields from most acetogenesis reactions across the wide range of
conditions encountered in the subseaﬂoor, (2) wide substrate spectra that enable niche
differentiation by use of different substrates and/or pooling of energy from a broad range
of energy substrates, (3) reduced energetic cost of biosynthesis among acetogens due
to use of the reductive acetyl CoA pathway for both energy production and biosynthesis
coupled with the ability to use many organic precursors to produce the key intermediate
acetyl CoA. This leads to the general conclusion that, beside Gibbs free energy yields,
variables such as metabolic strategy and energetic cost of biosynthesis need to be taken
into account to understand microbial survival in the energy-depleted deep biosphere.

INTRODUCTION
Past studies on anoxic sediments have demonstrated a redox zona-
tion among terminal organic matter remineralizing microbes in
relation to electron acceptor availability (e.g., Froelich et al., 1979;
Canﬁeld et al., 1993). Organisms using the electron acceptor with
the highest Gibbs free energy yields dominate over groups using
energetically less favorable electron acceptors (e.g., Cappenberg,
1974; Lovley and Goodwin, 1988; Hoehler et al., 1998). Higher
energy yields support faster growth rates and result in compet-
itive exclusion of groups using less favorable electron acceptors
(Cord-Ruwisch et al., 1988). Energy substrates with high turnover
rates, e.g., hydrogen (H2) and acetate, can even be drawn down
to thermodynamic threshold concentrations, at which only the
most energetically favorable electron acceptor present provides
sufﬁcient energy for proton translocation across the cell mem-
brane, ATP formation, and growth (Hoehler et al., 2001; Hoehler,
2004). Evidence supporting the notion of biological redox zona-
tion comes from freshwater and coastal marine sediments, as well
as laboratory-based chemostat and coculture experiments.

Consistent with the notion of redox zonation, the processes
of denitriﬁcation, manganese and iron reduction, and sulfate
reduction should exclude energetically less favorable reactions
involving CO2 reduction or disproportionation, wherever the
available nitrate, manganese (IV), iron (III), and sulfate pools
are not rate-limiting (e.g., Froelich et al., 1979; Canﬁeld et al.,
1993). In freshwater and coastal marine sediments depletion of
the most favorable oxidants often occurs shallowly owing to an
excess of electron donors produced by fermentation and hydrol-
ysis reactions (Capone and Kiene, 1988). This creates a niche

for methane-producing Archaea (methanogens) and acetate-
synthesizing microbes (acetogens), groups that are able to harvest
energy from CO2 reduction in underlying layers (e.g., Phelps and
Zeikus, 1984; Avery et al., 2002; Ferry and Lessner, 2008; Liu
and Conrad, 2011). Contrastingly, in more oligotrophic offshore
marine sediments, which cover most of the Earth’s surface, organic
matter and hence electron donor availability are typically limiting.
Depletion of nitrate, oxidized metals, sulfate, and/or even dioxy-
gen (O2) does not occur until tens of meters below the seaﬂoor – if
at all (e.g., D’Hondt et al., 2004; D’Hondt et al., 2009). Accordingly
methanogens and acetogens should be absent or at best lead fringe
existences – dormant, or surviving in small numbers on non-
competitive energy substrates not used by the other groups, such
as methylated C1 compounds or methoxylated aromatic com-
pounds (Franklin et al., 1988; Lever et al., 2010). Hence, recent
evidence from deeply buried marine sediments indicating signiﬁ-
cant accumulation of biogenic methane in the presence of sulfate
and metal reducing populations seems surprising (Wang et al.,
2008). Moreover, even though sulfate reducers and methanogens
gain more energy than acetogens from shared energy substrates,
there is increasing evidence that acetogens play a quantitatively
important role in organic carbon cycling in the marine and terres-
trial deep biosphere (Heuer et al., 2006, 2009; Griebler and Lueders,
2008; Pedersen et al., 2008; Lever et al., 2010).

In the following sections I will examine possible reasons for the
coexistence of acetogenesis with other pathways that are consid-
ered to be energetically more favorable in the deep subsurface. In
my analyses, I will (1) conservatively calculate the energy yields of
widespread acetogenesis reactions in the subsurface, (2) examine

the potential for substrate generalism as a successful strategy under
extreme energy limitation, and (3) examine the cost of biosyn-
thesis and potential ways by which acetogens may reduce energy
expended on biosynthesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Potential energy yields were calculated for a total of 14 acetogenic
substrates and 20 acetogenesis reactions (Table 1). Criteria for
the choice of these substrates were (1) widespread use by aceto-
gens, (2) previously shown quantitative importance of these or
related substrates as metabolic intermediates in anaerobic sed-
iments, (3) representation of a wide range of substrate types
used by acetogens, and (4) previously published thermodynamic
properties (Table 2). The reactions included inorganic substrates
(H2–CO2, CO), monocarboxylic acids (formate, lactate), dicar-
boxylic acids (glycolate, oxalate), alcohols (methanol, ethanol),
ketones (pyruvate), carbohydrates (glucose, cellobiose), methyl
halides (methyl chloride, CH3Cl; also known as chloromethane),
and methoxylated aromatic compounds (syringate, vanillate).

Given the scarcity/absence of concentration data for most of
these compounds from the deep subseaﬂoor, I used conservative
concentration estimates. This means that educt concentrations
used in calculations were in the lower end of the spectrum previ-
ously determined for these or similar substrates in the sedimentary
or marine setting, whereas product concentrations were near the
upper end of the previously measured concentration spectrum
(Meyer-Reil, 1978; Ansbaek and Blackburn, 1979; Sørensen et al.,
1981; Kaiser and Hanselmann, 1982; King et al., 1982, 1983; Smith
and Oremland, 1983; Smith et al., 1985; Edenborn and Litchﬁeld,
1987; King, 1988, 2007; Lovley and Goodwin, 1988; Martens, 1990;
Liu and Suﬂita, 1993; Hoehler et al., 1998; Chidhaisong et al.,
1999; Ballschmiter, 2003; Dhillon et al., 2005; Finke et al., 2006;

Chapelle and Bradley, 2007; Heuer et al., 2009; Lever et al., 2010).
Accordingly, a concentration of 0.1 nM was used for dissolved
gaseous energy substrates (CO, CH3Cl; H2 see next sentence),
while 100 nM were assumed for all other energy substrates. To
compensate for the high uncertainty regarding the accuracy of
existing H2 concentration data from below the seaﬂoor, due to
the importance of hydrogen as a (co-)substrate in several ace-
togenesis reactions (Table 1), and due to previously published
evidence suggesting acetogenesis via CO2 reduction with H2 in
the deep subsurface (Heuer et al., 2009), two hydrogen con-
centrations were used, 0.1 nM and 1 μM. These concentrations
include the range measured across a wide range of organic-rich
to ultra-oligotrophic subsurface sites during ocean drilling pro-
gram (ODP) Legs 201 and 204, IODP Expedition 329, and Meteor
Expedition M76 to the Benguela Upwelling Regime (Shipboard
Scientiﬁc Party, 2003; Lorenson et al., 2006; Expedition 329 Scien-
tists, 2011; Lin et al., 2011). For acetogenesis reactions involving H2
as a co-substrate, 1 μM H2 should be non-limiting. For metabolic
products, I assumed a 1-mM concentration of acetate, 100 nM gal-
late and protocatechuate, and typical seawater concentrations of
−8 M) and chloride (0.56 M; Pilson, 1998). Bicarbon-
protons (10
ate concentrations of 2 mM (typical seawater concentration) were
used when bicarbonate was an educt, and 200 mM when bicarbon-
ate was a product. For sulfate reduction reactions, I used sulfate
concentrations of 10 mM, and sulﬁde concentrations of 1 mM. For
methanogenesis reactions, I assumed methane concentrations of
1 mM. The pH used in all calculations was 8.0.

For calculations of the in situ energy yields of acetogene-
sis reactions from H2–CO2, formate–H2, and formate, I used
published data generated during ODP Leg 201 to the Equator-
ial Paciﬁc and Peru Margin (Shipboard Scientiﬁc Party, 2003).

acetate concentrations were used, in addition to pH. In situ tem-
perature was calculated from the measured thermal gradient at
each site. In situ pressure was calculated from the water and
sediment depth, assuming an average water density of 1.029 g
−3 and using average sediment bulk density values for site-
cm
speciﬁc sedimentary subunits (Shipboard Scientiﬁc Party, 2003).
Measured amino acid concentrations (glutamate, aspartate, ser-
ine, glycine) in ODP Leg 201 sediment cores were obtained from
Mitterer (2006).

Gibbs free energies per reaction were calculated for standard
conditions (25˚C, 1 atm), as well as temperature and pressure
extremes inclusive of most subsurface sediments on Earth (Stumm
and Morgan, 1981). −1.9˚C, the freezing temperature of most
seawater, represents the lower temperature boundary likely to be
encountered in the deep biosphere, while 122˚C marks the upper
temperature boundary tolerated by known life (Takai et al., 2008).
The pressure range of 1–1000 atm applies from shallow coastal sed-
iments to the vast majority of subsurface sediments in the open
ocean. Activities were approximated from concentrations by using
the measured activity coefﬁcient, γ, of bicarbonate (0.532) for

anionic acetogenesis substrates/products (formate, acetate, lactate,
oxalate, glycolate, syringate, vanillate), as well as the measured
activity coefﬁcient of methane (1.24) for gases (H2, CO) and
alcohols (methanol, ethanol; both from Millero and Schreiber,
1982). The activity coefﬁcients of water, carbohydrates (glucose,
cellobiose), and amino acids (aspartate, glutamate, glycine, serine)
were set to 1.0. Published activity coefﬁcients were used for sulfate
(0.104) and sulﬁde (0.410; Millero and Schreiber, 1982).

Gibbs energies per substrate were calculated from Gibbs ener-
gies per reaction by dividing the latter by the number of substrates
per reaction. Thermodynamic threshold concentrations of each
(cid:3)
substrate were calculated by setting ΔG
r to a an estimated biologi-
cal energy quantum (BEQ) of −10 kJ mol
−1 and solving the equa-
tion for the substrate concentration, all other educt, and product,
concentrations remaining the same and as outlined above.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
THE THERMODYNAMIC ARGUMENT
To assess the energetic feasibility of microbial metabolic reac-
tions (Table 1) in deep subseaﬂoor sediments, it is helpful to

conservatively calculate their energy yields under conditions that
resemble those found in situ. In this section, I examine the
energetic potential of various acetogenesis reactions to occur in
deep subseaﬂoor sediments by examining (1) Gibbs free energy
yields per reaction (ΔG
), (2) Gibbs free energy yields per substrate
(ΔG
), (3) thermodynamic threshold concentrations of substrates
for acetogenesis reactions to be thermodynamically favorable, (4)
in situ energy yields of the reactions for which educt and prod-
uct concentrations have been quantiﬁed in subseaﬂoor sediments,
and (5) energy yields per hydrogen molecule (H2) of the vari-
ous litho- and organotrophic acetogenesis reactions involving H2
compared to competing hydrogenotrophic sulfate reduction and
methanogenesis reactions.

Which acetogenesis reactions are thermodynamically favorable?
Calculated Gibbs free energies indicate that most acetogenesis
reactions are thermodynamically favorable in deep subseaﬂoor
=
sediments – with energy yields exceeding the BEQ (ΔG
−10 kJ mol
−1) under a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and

(cid:3)

hydrogen concentrations (Table 3). The highest energy values with
(cid:3)
−1 are in carbohydrates, pyruvate, methyl
ΔG
r
chloride, methoxylated aromatic compounds, and lactate. Other
substrates, such as glycolate, oxalate, methanol, and ethanol also
produce energy yields exceeding the BEQ. By contrast, the classic
autotrophic (“homoacetogenic”) reaction from H2–CO2 and reac-
tions from formate are endergonic at 0.1 nM H2 concentrations
(Table 3A), and only yield energy at 1 μM H2 concentrations and
low to intermediate temperatures (Table 3B). For energy-yielding
substrates that can be used with or without H2, i.e., carbon monox-
ide, lactate, methanol, and syringate, reactions not involving H2
yield more energy at [H2]= 0.1 nM than reactions involving H2;

in the case of carbon monoxide and lactate, this difference is
crucial, since reactions without hydrogen produce high-energy
yields, whereas reactions with H2 are endergonic (Table 3A). At
[H2]= 1 μM this changes, i.e., energy yields of some of the reac-
tions with hydrogen are exergonic, yielding more energy than the
BEQ (Table 3B); in one case (lactate, −1.9˚C) free energy yields
even exceed those of acetogenesis from lactate alone at low to

Within the calculated ranges, temperature has a much greater
impact on free energy yields of acetogenesis reactions than pres-
sure. For pressure changes from 1 to 1000 atm, the largest effect is
in reactions that include H2, with lactate+ H2 having the greatest

The magnitude of temperature effects seems to follow trends.
First of all, of the six reactions involving H2 or formate for which
temperature effects could be calculated, none are thermodynami-
cally favorable at 122˚C. This, and the vast overall decrease in free
energy yields for acetogenesis reactions involving H2 or formate in

response to temperature, suggests a strong selection against these
reactions at temperatures approaching the known upper limit of
life – unless H2 or formate concentrations at high temperatures
are much higher than assumed here. Secondly, there appears to be
a systematic difference in how temperature affects energy yields.
For all C1–C3 substrates except reactions from lactate alone, free
energy yields decrease with temperature; for reactions from lac-
tate alone, there is a slight increase with temperature. By contrast,
the free energy yields of acetogenesis reactions from the carbohy-
drates glucose (C6) and cellobiose (C12) show strong increases in
response to temperature. Based on the small number of substrates
included in these calculations and that the only two large substrates
included are carbohydrates, it is premature to argue that larger
carbon substrates should be consumed preferably at high temper-
atures. Yet, the fact that certain substrates or acetogenesis reactions
increase, while others decrease in energy yield in response to tem-
perature, suggests that temperature exerts an important control
over which substrates are consumed and energy-yielding reactions
performed by acetogens in the deep biosphere.

Acetogenesis in the deep biosphere

(cid:3)

< −100 kJ mol

Which acetogenesis reactions are most likely under the conditions
examined?
The Gibbs free energy yield of a metabolic reaction indicates
whether this reaction can be used as a source of energy in a
given environment. Under substrate-limiting conditions, as are
likely in the deep biosphere, one might, however, expect micro-
bial consumer choices – assuming they follow optimum foraging
behavior – to be driven by energy yields per mole of substrate – as
long as the overall reaction produces more energy than the BEQ.
For substrates that can be metabolized via multiple reactions that
each yield more energy than the BEQ, e.g., methanol at −1.9˚C
(Table 3), one might expect consumers to show a preference
toward the reactions with the highest energy yield per substrate.
Additionally, it is possible that organisms, despite being energy-
starved, show a preference toward certain substrates over others
based on energy content per substrate molecule. To examine pos-
sible consequences of an optimum foraging behavior that is driven
by energy yields per substrate, the latter were calculated (Table 4).
Comparing different substrates on a per-substrate-level, Gibbs
−1) for cel-
free energy yields remain high (ΔG
lobiose, glucose (all T and P), lactate+ H2 (only at [H2]= 1 μM,
−1.9 and 25˚C; all unchanged compared to Table 3), as well as
syringate (Table 4). Provided their availability in the deep bios-
phere, and that acetogens make choices based on energy per
substrate molecule, these substrates should be consumed pref-
erentially over the others examined. Other good substrates may
include – in order of descenting energy yields – vanillate, methyl
chloride, lactate, pyruvate, methanol, and oxalate. The classic
lithoautotrophic reaction from H2–CO2, and reactions from for-
mate and glycolate, are the least energy-yielding on a per-substrate-
level, and therefore the least likely to be consumed, should energy
content on a substrate-level determine acetogenic substrate choice.
When comparing energy yields of acetogenesis substrates for
which multiple reaction pathways are known, i.e., CO, formate,
lactate, methanol, and syringate, the same overall trends seen on a
per-reaction-level still hold for formate and syringate – indepen-
dent of H2 concentrations (Tables 3 and 4). For carbon monoxide,
lactate, and methanol, the same trends occur at [H2]= 1 nM, but
not at [H2]= 1 μM. In spite of the overall reaction from carbon
monoxide+ H2 at high [H2] (Table 4), acetogenesis from car-
bon monoxide+ H2 yields more energy on a per-substrate-level
(Table 4). For lactate, reactions from lactate+ H2 at high H2
yield more energy per lactate than reactions from lactate alone –
not only, as previously, at −1.9˚C (Table 3), but also at +25˚C
(Table 4). And for methanol – unlike before (Table 3) – reac-
tions with H2 yield more energy per methanol at high H2 and low
temperature (−1.9 to 25˚C) than reactions with methanol alone
(Table 4). These results conﬁrm the importance of calculating
energy yields on a per-substrate-level. Moreover, they underscore
the likely importance of temperature in regulating which acetoge-
nesis reactions are occurring in situ – even when these reactions
involve the same carbon substrate.

monoxide yielding more energy than the reaction from carbon

The potential advantages for survival in energy-starved envi-
ronments are apparent. Yet, it is not known whether microbes
express any form of substrate selectivity in the energy-starved
deep biosphere, or rather indiscriminately consume any metab-
olizable substrate that enters their reach. The strategy employed
by an individual cell may not solely depend on the energy yield per
substrate. Other factors, such as substrate turnover rate, energetic
cost of substrate/metabolite transport across the cell membrane,
and energy return on investment for each enzyme that needs to be
synthesized to catabolize an additional energy substrate will most
likely also affect which substrates are consumed.

Which acetogenesis reactions are likely to occur in situ?
The calculated free energy yields presented so far are based on
limited published information on concentrations of acetogenic
substrates. Only H2, formate, and acetate concentration data have
been published for the deep subseaﬂoor biosphere (Shipboard Sci-
entiﬁc Party, 2003; Lorenson et al., 2006; Heuer et al., 2009; Lever
et al., 2010; Expedition 329 Scientists, 2011); concentrations of
the other substrates had to be approximated using data from sur-
ﬁcial marine sediments (Meyer-Reil, 1978; Sørensen et al., 1981;
King et al., 1983; Smith and Oremland, 1983; Parkes et al., 1989;
Martens, 1990; Hoehler et al., 2001; Dhillon et al., 2005; Finke
et al., 2006; King, 2007), freshwater sediments (King et al., 1982;
Lovley and Goodwin, 1988; Chidhaisong et al., 1999; Keppler et al.,
2000), marine water columns (Edenborn and Litchﬁeld, 1987;
Ballschmiter, 2003), and the terrestrial deep biosphere (Chapelle
and Bradley, 2007). Since concentrations of H2, formate, and
acetate in the deep biosphere overlap with the concentrations of
these species in other sedimentary environments, it seems realistic
to conservatively approximate subseaﬂoor concentrations of other
substrates, such as glucose or oxalate, with the lowest values mea-
sured in other sedimentary environments. This cannot hide the
fact that actual concentrations have not been measured, however.
An alternative to calculating energy yields at assumed substrate
concentrations is therefore to calculate the threshold concentra-
tions required for acetogens to meet the BEQ from a substrate.
This can be done conservatively, since the concentrations of most
other reaction educts and products, i.e., H

H2, Cl
, are well-constrained for the deep biosphere and/or set
to conservative values (see Materials and Methods). Thermody-
namic threshold concentrations were, as previously, calculated for

[H2]= 0.1 nM and 1 μM (Table 5).

At ﬁrst glance it is clear that the concept of threshold con-
centrations is only relevant for a subset of acetogenic sub-

strates. For glucose, cellobiose, syringate, as well as syringate+ H2
at 1 μM [H2], threshold concentrations are lower than a sin-
gle molecule of
the substrate per liter. In fact, thermody-
namic threshold concentrations for glucose and cellobiose are
even orders of magnitude lower than one molecule per Earth’s
entire ocean volume (Table 5)! For carbon monoxide, lactate,

pyruvate, methyl chloride, syringate+ H2 at low [H2], or lac-
tate+ H2 at high [H2] it also seems unlikely that meeting the

The extent to which microbes can detect and respond to
(minor) differences in energy yields of different reactions involv-
ing the same substrates, thereby optimizing their foraging behavior
with respect to energy yields per substrate, is poorly understood.

BEQ is a realistic obstacle. For these reactions, threshold con-
centrations are at most in the low picomolar range – and
with that ∼2–3 orders of magnitude lower than microbes are
known to draw limiting metabolite concentrations down to (e.g.,

Fuhrman and Ferguson, 1986; Hoehler et al., 2001; Stolper et al.,
2010). If previously measured concentrations of organic substrates
in deep subsurface sediments, which have for the most part been
(0.1 μM (e.g., Shipboard Scientiﬁc Party, 2003; Mitterer, 2006;
Heuer et al., 2009; Lever et al., 2010), are a good reference, then
we are left with the same conclusions as before (Table 4), i.e., that
most acetogenesis reactions produce energy yields in excess of the
BEQ, even at substrate concentrations that are low for the deep
biosphere.

More interestingly, perhaps, examining those substrates that
were previously considered less likely to be used by acetogens
(based on Tables 3 and 4), suggests that even formate and H2–CO2
are potential acetogen substrates in some subsurface environ-
ments. Formate concentrations from low micromolar to tens of
micromolar (Table 5) have been documented for sites ranging
from organic-rich (ODP Site 1230) to highly oligotrophic (ODP
Site 1231; Shipboard Scientiﬁc Party, 2003). Thermodynamic cal-
culations based on measured formate concentrations suggest that
formate could be a substrate of acetogenesis at certain depths in
subsurface sediments on the Juan de Fuca Ridge Flank (Lever et al.,

2010). Accurate quantiﬁcations of hydrogen concentrations in the
deep biosphere are fraught with uncertainty, with two different
methods yielding results differing by up to two orders of magni-
tude (Lin et al., 2011). Yet, independent of the method used, mea-
sured concentrations exceeding 10 nM are not uncommon (Ship-
board Scientiﬁc Party, 2003; Lorenson et al., 2006; Expedition 329
Scientists, 2011; Lin et al., 2011), and suggest that even acetogenesis
from H2–CO2 is possible in some places, if not widespread.

In situ energy yields of acetogenesis reactions based on measured
concentrations
To the best of my knowledge, the only subseaﬂoor sediment sam-
ples for which all educt and product concentrations of acetogenesis
reactions have been quantiﬁed are from ODP Leg 201 (Shipboard
Scientiﬁc Party, 2003). The seven sites sampled during this expe-
dition vary from organic-rich to oligotrophic and cover a range of
energy conditions that is likely to include most anoxic subseaﬂoor
sediments on Earth. For these samples, the concentrations of for-
mate and hydrogen (and no other acetogenic substrates) were
measured in parallel with concentrations of acetate, DIC (proxy

for bicarbonate), and pH, allowing for the calculation of in situ
energy yields of acetogenesis reactions from H2–CO2, formate,
and formate+ H2 (Figure 1).

Calculated free energy yields for the three reactions show clear
trends: reactions from H2–CO2 are mostly endergonic, and only
yield energy in excess of the BEQ value at a few shallow depths at
ODP Site 1231 (Figure 1A). Reactions from formate are exergonic
with energy yields around or exceeding the BEQ across all sites

and depths sampled (Figure 1B). Reactions from formate+ H2,

are for the most part slightly exergonic, but only exceed the BEQ
at a few depths at ODP Sites 1225, 1230, and 1231 (Figure 1C).

Based on these results, one might suppose that acetogene-
sis from formate is possible across a wide range of subseaﬂoor
habitats, whereas acetogenesis reactions involving H2–CO2 or for-
mate+ H2 are unlikely. Yet, the high uncertainty associated with
the quantiﬁcation of porewater H2 concentrations needs to be
taken into account. H2 concentrations measured during ODP Leg
201 were obtained via an incubation method, which assumes head-
space hydrogen to be in equilibrium with dissolved hydrogen in
pore ﬂuids after an incubation period (Lovley and Goodwin, 1988;
Hoehler et al., 1998). When compared to a new, extraction-based
method on the same samples, the incubation method yields con-
centration measurements that are consistently lower by one to two
orders of magnitude (Lin et al., 2011). If in situ concentrations of
H2 in sediments sampled during Leg 201 are one order of magni-
(cid:3)
tude higher than measured previously, this would lower the ΔG
−1. In this case, close
r
for acetogenesis from H2–CO2 by ∼22 kJ mol
to half of the samples would have energy values exceeding the BEQ
(Figure 1A). If in situ concentrations are two orders of magnitude
(cid:3)
higher, this will lower the ΔG
r for acetogenesis from H2–CO2 by
−1 of the
an additional ∼22 kJ mol
reaction compared to the measured H2 data. In this case, energy
yields of acetogenesis from H2–CO2 would exceed the BEQ in the
overwhelming majority of samples collected during Leg 201.

Energy yields of acetogenesis reactions involving H2 compared to
competing sulfate reduction and methanogenesis reactions
The main empirical support for the concept of redox zona-
tion comes from isotopic tracer studies and measurements of

hydrogen concentrations in sulfate-reducing and methanogenic
freshwater and coastal surface sediments (e.g., Cappenberg, 1974;
Capone and Kiene, 1988; Lovley and Goodwin, 1988; Hoehler
et al., 1998; Heimann et al., 2010). Acetogenesis has received
less attention in sediments due to the difﬁculty of detecting
the process; after all the end product acetate is also a key sub-
strate to sulfate reducers and methanogens, and rapid turnover
results in acetate typically not accumulating to high concentra-
tions – unlike the end products of sulfate reduction and methano-
genesis, sulﬁde, and methane. Moreover, acetogenesis is often
equated with the“homoacetogenic”reaction from H2–CO2, which
is thermodynamically unfavorable under thermodynamic con-
trol of H2 concentrations in sulfate-reducing or methanogenic
sediments. Only rarely have energy yields of organotrophic ace-
togenesis reactions that include H2 been taken into account
(Liu and Suﬂita, 1993; Lever et al., 2010). Here I compare the
energy yields of various acetogenesis reactions involving H2 to
those of the widespread hydrogenotrophic sulfate reduction and
methanogenesis reactions at a wide range of H2 concentrations
(Figure 2).

At ﬁrst glance it is apparent that acetogenesis from H2–CO2
is thermodynamically less favorable than sulfate or methanogen-
esis reactions from H2–CO2, independent of H2 concentrations
(Figure 2A). Under the conditions used in calculations, sul-
fate reducers can meet the BEQ down to H2 concentrations of
∼0.6 nM, methanogens down to 11 nM, whereas acetogens require
410 nM H2 concentrations. Acetogenesis from formate+ H2 is
also unlikely, as its energy yields are below the BEQ unless H2
concentrations are in the micromolar range. More energetically
favorable than sulfate reduction or methanogenesis is, however,

the acetogenic reaction from syringate+ H2, which even at H2
concentrations as low as 0.01 nM produces high-energy yields
(∼−90 kJ mol
−1) – concentrations at which both sulfate reduc-
tion and methanogenesis are endergonic. Moreover, while sul-
fate reduction from H2–CO2 is the overall second most energy-
yielding reaction, acetogenesis reactions from CO, methanol, and
lactate produce more energy than hydrogenotrophic methano-
genesis at H2 concentrations within the typical range measured in
deep subseaﬂoor sediments.

When energy yields are considered on a per hydrogen molecule
level, the results are even more striking. Acetogenesis reactions

from syringate+ H2, methanol+ H2, and CO+ H2 all provide
more energy per H2 molecule than sulfate reduction from H2–
CO2 (Figure 2B). The reaction from lactate+ H2 yields less energy

than hydrogenotrophic sulfate reduction, but slightly more than
hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, while acetogenesis reactions

from formate+ H2 and H2–CO2 produce the least amount of
energy per H2 molecule and are endergonic except at micromolar
H2 concentrations (Figure 2B).

One might argue that carboxydo- and organotrophic aceto-
genesis reactions involving H2 are unlikely in marine sediments.
After all, reactions involving the same carbon substrate without
H2 yield more energy except when high H2 concentrations coin-
cide with low temperature (Tables 3 and 4) – a condition that has
traditionally only been observed during season-induced tempo-
rary disequilibria in shallow sediments (Hoehler et al., 1999) and
is perhaps unlikely in seasonally stable subsurface sediments. Yet,
the method-dependent discrepancies in measured H2 concentra-
tions in deep subsurface sediments (Lin et al., 2011) leave room for
high uncertainty; if the higher [H2] measurements obtained with a
new extraction-based method (Lin et al., 2011) turn out to be accu-
rate, then carboxydo- and organotrophic acetogenesis reactions
with H2 may be competitive, if not energetically favorable, over
carboxydo- and organotrophic reactions without H2 in the pre-
dominantly cold, deep biosphere. Evidence supporting the impor-
tance of organotrophic reactions with H2 comes from subsurface
sediments of the Atlantic Coastal Plain (Liu and Suﬂita, 1993).
An acetogenic isolate from these sediments only showed growth
through O-demethoxylation of syringate under an H2–CO2
atmosphere, while no growth on syringate was observed under
an N2–CO2 or N2 atmosphere. And by metabolizing syringate
with H2, this organism was able to outcompete hydrogenotrophic
methanogens for H2 in the initial sediment enrichment.

The ability to gain energy from the demethoxylation of
syringate or other lignin monomers is widespread among aceto-
gens, but not among sulfate reducers or methanogens, suggesting
that methoxy-groups on aromatic rings might represent non-
competitive substrates (Lever et al., 2010). The same is not true
for the other substrates, lactate, CO, and methanol (Figure 2).
Lactate serves as a growth substrate not only to many acetogens
(Lever et al., 2010), but also to many sulfate reducers (Rabus et al.,
2006), which can be expected to have higher energy yields from
competing sulfate reduction reactions. Similarly, despite being less
widely used as growth substrates than among acetogens (Lever
et al., 2010), CO, and methanol can also serve as energy substrates
to certain sulfate reducers (reviewed in Mörsdorf et al., 1992), as
well as several methanogens (reviewed in Whitman et al., 2006,
and in Ferry, 2010). Both sulfate reducers and methanogens can
be expected to gain more energy from reactions involving CO or
methanol than acetogens. Hence, evidence suggesting an impor-
tant role for acetogenesis in the cycling of CO and methanol in
marine and freshwater sediments might be surprising (King, 2007;
Jiang et al., 2010). In the following section, I will argue that the
ability of acetogens to use a wide range of substrates is a viable
survival strategy under conditions of energy limitation – despite
lower energy yields per substrate.

METABOLIC STRATEGIES OF ACETOGENS
A striking feature of acetogens as a metabolic guild is the wide-
spread ability to use a large number and wide diversity of carbon
compounds as energy substrates. Over half of all cultured strains
test positively for growth on H2/CO2, carbon monoxide, formate,
methanol, ethanol, other aliphatic compounds such as lactate, and
methoxylated aromatic compounds (Lever et al., 2010). Further
widely used growth substrates include carbohydrates, other short-
chain fatty acids and alcohols, methoxylated aliphatic compounds,
betaines, amino acids, and aldehydes (Drake et al., 2006). Even

Acetogenesis in the deep biosphere

complex organic polymers, such as cellulose or carboxymethylcel-
lulose, are used by some strains (Wolin and Miller, 1994; Karita
et al., 2003; Wolin et al., 2003). Due to the limited number of
energy substrates on which growth is typically tested, substrate
ranges of acetogens may signiﬁcantly exceed the currently known
spectrum. Any methyl or methoxyl groups of compounds found in
the environment represent potential energy substrates, that, given
thermodynamically favorable conditions, might be combined with
CO2 to form acetate.

Considering the striking metabolic versatility of acetogens, it
seems plausible that the resulting plasticity with respect to sub-
strate use is part of the strategy that enables acetogens to coexist
with sulfate reducers and methanogens. In the following sections,
I will examine two hypotheses that seek to explain the beneﬁts of
a wide metabolic spectrum. The ﬁrst hypothesis is that acetogens
can coexist with sulfate reducers and methanogens due to niche
differentiation with respect to substrate use. In other words, ace-
togens may avoid competition by consuming substrates not used
by sulfate reducers or methanogens. The second hypothesis is that
the ability to pool energy from a wide range of metabolic reactions
enables coexistence despite lower energy from shared substrates.
These two hypotheses are not incompatible, but should rather
be regarded as two complementary advantages of a generalist
metabolic strategy.

Niche differentiation based on substrate use
When viewed collectively, sulfate reducers, though not to the
same extent as acetogens, can also exploit a large variety of sub-
strates. When examined more closely, however, it appears that
only the ability to use H2, short-chain fatty acids, and ethanol
is truly widespread across the various genera (Rabus et al., 2006).
Common acetogenic substrates such as methanol, glucose, fruc-
tose, carbon monoxide, and methoxylated lignin monomers are
not substrates to the vast majority of sulfate reducers (Mörsdorf
et al., 1992; Rabus et al., 2006). The thermodynamic advantage of
higher energy yields of sulfate reduction compared to acetogen-
esis thus only plays out for a subset of acetogenic substrates that
are also utilized by sulfate reducers. Tracer experiments indicat-
ing H2 and short-chain fatty acids as the main electron donors
used by sulfate reducers in estuarine and marine sediments sup-
port this conclusion (Sørensen et al., 1981; Parkes et al., 1989).
Similarly, experimental evidence indicating acetogens as key con-
sumers of CO and methoxyl groups in sulfate-reducing marine
sediments (Küsel et al., 1999; King, 2007) suggests that, despite
overlaps in substrates, acetogens, and sulfate reducers practice a
form of niche differentiation in which each group favors different
energy substrates where they coexist.

Vastly less metabolically versatile than acetogens or sulfate
reducers, the substrate range of methanogens is limited to (1) CO2
reduction (H2/CO2, formate, a few use carbon monoxide or alco-
hols), (2) acetate disproportionation, and (3) demethylation of C1
compounds (methanol, methyl sulﬁdes, and methylamines). With
the exception of one genus (Methanosarcina), most methanogens
are substrate specialists and only capable of growth on one of these
three substrate groups (Whitman et al., 2006). Hence, potential
competition between acetogens and methanogens for substrates is
limited to a small subset of acetogenic substrates.

Niche differentiation, resulting in use of different energy sub-
strates where the groups coexist, may thus explain why sulfate
reducers and methanogens do not competitively exclude aceto-
gens in anoxic sediments. Why have sulfate reducers not adapted
to use the full spectrum of substrates used by acetogens? And,
given that both acetogens and methanogens utilize the reductive
acetyl CoA pathway for energy production and/or C ﬁxation and
overlap in substrate use (Drake et al., 2006; Whitman et al., 2006),
why might these two groups differ so drastically with respect to
their metabolic versatility? The ultimate evolutionary explanations
remain subject to speculation. On a more proximal level, differ-
ences in energy yields and turnover rates of energy substrates may
have played a role in driving differences in metabolic strategies.

The most common substrates used by sulfate reducers and
methanogens, i.e., H2 and acetate, so called central intermedi-
ates of organic carbon degradation (e.g., Valentine, 2001; Dolﬁng
et al., 2008), are presumably the electron donors with the highest
turnover rates in anoxic sediments. Other short-chain fatty acids,
which represent important energy substrates to sulfate reduc-
ers are also known to have high turnover rates (Sørensen et al.,
1981; Parkes et al., 1989); even methylated compounds used by
methanogens, i.e., methanol, methylamines, and methyl sulﬁdes,
are known to have high turnover rates in certain environments
(e.g., Zhilina and Zavarzin, 1990; Mitterer et al., 2001; Jiang et al.,
2010; Lin et al., 2010). Substrates with high turnover rates are
typically small, as they derive from a variety of individually less
abundant, larger source molecules; they also often harbor less
energy than larger organic molecules with lower turnover rates
(Tables 3 and 4). Why might certain groups utilize substrates with
high turnover rates but low-energy yields, while others use sub-
strates with low turnover rates but high-energy yields? Part of
the answer may lie in the universal requirement of cells to meet
maintenance energy requirements.

−Ea/RT

Meeting maintenance energy requirements is especially chal-
lenging in deep subsurface sediments, as these have typically been
cut off from fresh organic matter supplies for thousands to mil-
lions of years. Here the vast majority of cells is likely to be in a
permanent state of starvation (D’Hondt et al., 2004; Jørgensen
et al., 2006) and starvation may even represent the primary source
of mortality. Based on chemostat experiments, the following rela-
tionship between maintenance energy and temperature has been
established (Tijhuis et al., 1993; Harder, 1997):
ME = A ∗ e

where ME is the maintenance energy (kJ (g dry mass)
A a constant [4.99× 1012 kJ (g dry mass)

vation energy (69.4 kJ mol

−1 K
stant (0.008314 kJ mol
value of the constant A was calculated from the energy sup-
ply rate at which microbial cell growth and replication stops in
chemostat experiments (Tijhuis et al., 1993). It has since been
estimated that the actual threshold energy required for cell main-
tenance is three orders of magnitude lower than the threshold for
growth/replication (Price and Sowers, 2004; Biddle et al., 2006).
Therefore, I will use a value of 4.99× 109 kJ (g dry mass)
−1 for
A in all calculations of ME. Based on this value of A, a maintenance

ate at one-half, one-third, or one-fourth the substrate turnover

to meet MEcell diminishes with increasing energy yields per sub-
strate (MEB, Figure 3C). It follows that the minimum turnover
rates of the three competing methanogenesis and sulfate reduc-
tion reactions are only lower by 9, 17, and 23%, when the energy

Returning to the question raised earlier in this section, i.e.,
whether methanogens/sulfate reducers and acetogens may prac-
tice a form of niche differentiation, in which each group uses
different substrates where they co-occur, the model presented here
provides clear answers. Feeding on high-energy, low turnover sub-
strates is a viable survival strategy for microbes, as is feeding on
low-energy, high turnover substrates. The two strategies may, at
least in part, explain the coexistence of acetogenic with sulfate-

Calculations are shown for four different “pathways”; “plus 0” is the pathway with the lowest Gibbs free energies, and an analog for acetogenesis; “plus 10,” “plus
20,” and “plus 30” are energetically more favorable pathways that produce 10, 20, and 30 kJ more energy per mole of substrate. These energetically more favorable
pathways are analogs for methanogenesis and sulfate reduction reactions. The ratios in required substrate turnover rates for the plus 0 pathway vs. the other three

why sulfate reducers/methanogens may mainly use low-energy,
high turnover substrates is their vast energetic advantage over
(cid:3)
acetogens in metabolizing these substrates. At high ΔG
s, the
energetic advantage of sulfate reducers/methanogens over ace-
togens decreases, and other guild-speciﬁc traits may increase in
importance. One of these will be discussed in the following section.

Specialist vs. generalist arguments
The potential advantages of a specialist vs. a generalist life style
have been the subject of discussions among ecologists for over ﬁve
decades. A traditional view is that selectivity (specialization) pays
off under non-limiting energy conditions, while less discrimina-
tion toward food sources (generalism) is the more effective survival
strategy under energy limitation (e.g., Emlen, 1966; Dykhuizen
and Davies, 1980; for reviews see Pianka, 1994; Egli, 1995). With
respect to microbial ecology, this argumentation has been called
into question by certain microbial growth experiments, in which
long starvation periods appeared to favor specialists (e.g., Kuenen,
1983).

A fundamental difference between microbes and macrobiota
under energy limitation is that microbes not only struggle to
meet maintenance energy requirements, but also to acquire a
minimum free energy (BEQ) from a metabolic reaction to even

be able to produce ATP. Hence, substrate specialists are often
equipped with high substrate afﬁnities down to very low concen-
trations that enable them to outcompete not only other metabolic
guilds, but also other members of their own metabolic guild.
A classic example among methanogens is the obligately aceti-
clastic Methanosaeta genus which can grow on acetate concen-
trations below 10 μM (Jetten et al., 1992). By comparison, the
(by methanogen standards) “generalistic” Methanosarcina genus,
members of which can grow via CO2 reduction, acetate dis-
proportionation, and demethylation of C1 compounds, requires
acetate concentration of at least 200 μM for growth (Jetten
et al., 1992). High substrate afﬁnity appears to be a strategy
among specialists by which they can more efﬁciently take up
substrates and drive substrate concentrations below the thresh-
old concentrations required by generalists. This form of energetic
(i.e., thermodynamic) exclusion, which only occurs in microbes,
provides a gateway for substrate specialists, provided they can
meet maintenance energy requirements. The costs of substrate
specialization are a smaller accessible energy pool due to uti-
lization of fewer energy substrates and lower energy yields per
substrate.

In energy-starved environments, such as deep subsurface sed-
iments, a specialist metabolic strategy may work effectively for

Acetogenesis in the deep biosphere

substrates with high turnover rates. High turnover rates and rel-
atively high cell densities are necessary to maintain the low sub-
strate concentrations that enable specialists to thermodynamically
exclude less efﬁcient consumers of the same substrate. As shown
earlier (Tables 1–3), thermodynamic exclusion of acetogens is
only likely for the low-energy substrates H2 and formate, how-
ever. Other, less common, but more energy-rich substrates occur
at concentrations exceeding the thermodynamic threshold, and
provide little incentive for specialization due to the impossibility
of thermodynamically excluding other groups, such as acetogens,
from consuming them. Hence, a more generalist metabolic strat-
egy may be more effective among consumers of these more rare,
energy-rich substrates.

As discussed in a previous section, substrate generalism is a
widespread trait among acetogens. With respect to meeting main-
tenance energy requirements, there are clear advantages to using
more than one substrate (Figure 4); for instance, at high turnover
rates and low ΔGs (−10 kJ mol
−1 substrate) combining the energy
(cid:3)
yields of two substrates, A and B, with the same ΔG
s and kcell may
enable acetogens to lower their required substrate turnover by 50%
and successfully compete with methanogens/sulfate reducers that
gain 10 kJ more energy per mole of substrate A (MEA; Figure 4;
Table 6B). While this is an improvement of competitiveness, pool-
ing the energy from two substrates is still insufﬁcient to compete
with methanogens/sulfate reducers gaining 20 or 30 kJ more per
mole of substrate, which still can meet MEcell on turnover rates that
are 33 and 50% lower, respectively (Table 6B). To match energy
yields of the latter, energy from three or four substrates with the
properties of substrate A would need to be pooled – a consid-
erable disadvantage in terms of energy efﬁciency as one might
argue. This changes for substrates with high-energy yields (e.g.,
−100 kJ mol
−1 substrate) and resultingly low required turnover
rates (MEB; Figure 4). For these, pooling the energy from two sub-
strates would enable an acetogen to grow at a signiﬁcantly lower
turnover rate than any of the competing methanogens/sulfate
reducers utilizing only one substrate – a signiﬁcant advantage
(Figure 4; Table 6B). It follows from this that pooling the energy
from multiple substrates would increase acetogenic competitive-
ness with sulfate reducers and methanogens overall – and in
particular for energy-rich substrates.

The same principle as in comparing the beneﬁts of using two
vs. one substrates applies in comparing the beneﬁts of using more,
e.g., 3 vs. 2, 5 vs. 4, 10 vs. 5, etc., substrates. The main point is that
acetogens typically have wider substrate spectra than sulfate reduc-
ers or methanogens, and that pooling energy from a larger number
of substrates may enable acetogens to in some cases survive on
lower substrate turnover rates than the other groups, despite
lower energy yields per substrate. Experimental evidence that
conﬁrms pooling of energy sources as the explanation for the coex-
istence of acetogenic with sulfate-reducing and/or methanogenic
populations in the deep biosphere is still missing. However, the
same principle has been demonstrated in continuous-ﬂow cul-
tures involving other groups of microorganisms that were grown
under carbon-limiting conditions: here several studies have shown
substrate generalists to grow at lower substrate concentrations
than substrate specialists when incubations included multiple

FIGURE 4 | The same relationship as in Figure 3C, except that turnover
rates required for MEA and MEB (“plus 0”) are now calculated for the

the same as before.

substrates (Gottschal et al., 1979; Dykhuizen and Davies, 1980;
reviewed in Egli et al., 1993; Egli, 1995).

Based on the calculations presented (Figure 4; Table 6B), one
might conclude that pooling energy is only an effective strategy
for subseaﬂoor acetogens to meet MEcell if it involves high-energy
substrates. For low-energy substrates, more specialized organisms
with higher energy yields per substrate, i.e., sulfate reducers and
methanogens, should have a vast advantage (Figure 4), provided
that energy yields of acetogenesis reactions even exceed the BEQ.
Even the most efﬁcient specialist will reach a limit when substrate
turnover rates drop below the threshold required to meet MEcell,
however; at this point the specialist is either forced to consume
additional substrates, or to allow substrate concentrations above
the thermodynamic threshold. Evidence potentially supporting
the latter comes from oligotrophic sediments of the South Paciﬁc
Gyre and Equatorial Paciﬁc, where H2 concentration peaks in
the tens of nanomolar range have been reported for subsurface
horizons with exceedingly low microbial activities (Shipboard Sci-
entiﬁc Party, 2003; Expedition 329 Scientists, 2011). If substrate
specialists are forced to allow substrate concentrations above the
thermodynamic threshold, they become vulnerable to less efﬁ-
cient, more generalistic organisms competing for their preferred
substrate. Ultimately, because of the larger accessible substrate and
hence energy pool, one might therefore expect substrate generalists
to dominate under the most energy-depleted conditions.

The results presented thus far suggest that it is very difﬁ-
cult to predict the outcome of the complex competition between
acetogens and other groups for substrates in the deep biosphere.
Beside physical variables, such as temperature and pressure, it may

be necessary to measure concentrations of all educts and prod-
ucts of relevance – a very challenging task with acetogens, due to
their wide substrate spectra – as well as measure substrate-speciﬁc
turnover rates – a seemingly impossible undertaking given the
very low turnover rates in the deep biosphere. Even with complete
knowledge on concentrations and turnover rates, predicting com-
petitive outcomes on a substrate-level would be compromised
by our still limited knowledge on the metabolic capabilities of
microbes inhabiting anoxic (subseaﬂoor) sediments, as well as
other important life history traits. One of the latter is the ener-
getic cost of biosynthesis – a variable that is likely to vary widely
across microbes and microbial metabolic guilds.

THE ENERGETIC COST OF BIOSYNTHESIS AMONG ACETOGENS
Of the currently known six pathways of autotrophic carbon ﬁxa-
tion, the reductive acetyl CoA pathway is the simplest and energet-
ically most favorable due to the absence of complex biochemical
intermediates (Russell and Martin, 2004; Berg et al., 2010). This
strictly anaerobic pathway only consists of a carbonyl branch, in
which CO2 is reduced to an enzyme-bound carbonyl group, and
a methyl branch, in which CO2 is reduced to a cofactor-bound
methyl group. The bifunctional enzyme CO dehydrogenase/acetyl
CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) carries out both the reduction of CO2
to CO, as well as the synthesis of the end product, acetyl CoA, by
joining the carbonyl and methyl groups (e.g., Hügler and Sievert,
2011). The reductive acetyl CoA pathway is unique among C ﬁx-
ation pathways in that it is linear; given geochemically favorable
conditions, e.g., in alkaline hydrothermal vent environments, each
step is exergonic, meaning that CO2 ﬁxation can occur sponta-
neously (Martin and Russell, 2007). It has therefore been suggested
that this pathway started as a geochemical pathway (Russell and
Martin, 2004). Moreover, due to it being the only known C ﬁxation
pathway that occurs in both Bacteria and Archaea, it has been con-
jectured that the reductive acetyl CoA pathway is the most ancient
C ﬁxation pathway (Fuchs and Stupperich, 1985), or even the very
ﬁrst biochemical pathway to have evolved on Earth (Peretó et al.,
2004). The great simplicity and low energetic cost suggest that
anaerobic organisms using this pathway have an energetic advan-
tage over organisms using other C ﬁxation pathways, such as the
reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle.

The reductive acetyl CoA pathway is found in all known aceto-
gens and methanogens, as well as several autotrophic sulfate reduc-
ers and anammox bacteria (Schauder et al., 1989; Drake et al., 2006;
Strous et al., 2006; Whitman et al., 2006). Certain methanogens
and autotrophic sulfate reducers use the pathway exclusively
for biosynthesis, while others, including acetate-oxidizing sul-
fate reducers, aceticlastic methanogens, and syntrophic acetate
oxidizers, can produce energy by reversing the pathway so it
becomes oxidative (e.g., Spormann and Thauer, 1988; Hattori
et al., 2005; Liu and Whitman, 2008). Acetogens, and among
these I include facultative acetogens, such as certain sulfate reduc-
ers, methanogens, and anaerobic acetate oxidizers (e.g., Jansen
et al., 1984; Rother and Metcalf, 2004; Hattori et al., 2005; Lessner
et al., 2006; Henstra et al., 2007), are the only group known to
perform this pathway both for biosynthesis and energy produc-
tion. A possible advantage of using the same pathway for energy
production and biomass assimilation is that smaller genomes

and fewer enzymes need to be produced and maintained. Since
starvation mode is likely to be the rule rather than the excep-
tion among microbes in energy-deprived subseaﬂoor sediments
(Jørgensen et al., 2006), reducing the energetic cost of genome
maintenance and enzyme synthesis may confer a signiﬁcant advan-
tage to microbes that are able to carry out energy production and
biosynthesis via the same pathway.

It has, in fact, been postulated that the synthesis and main-
tenance of enzymes to repair DNA from depurination reactions
and proteins from racemization reactions are the main energy
expenditures among microorganisms in survival mode (Price and
Sowers, 2004). While too little is known about cell-speciﬁc enzyme
concentrations and turnover rates in the deep subseaﬂoor to cal-
culate the energetic cost of synthesizing and maintaining these
enzymes, concentrations of protein building blocks, i.e., certain
amino acids (aspartate, glutamate, serine, glycine), have been mea-
sured in subsurface sediments of the Peru Margin and Equatorial
Paciﬁc (Mitterer, 2006). I use these here to calculate the ener-
getic cost of their lithoautotrophic synthesis. Irrespective of the
site, a high energetic cost can be expected for the synthesis of
all four amino acids (Figure 5). Assuming that this is a gen-
eral trend across amino acids, the lithoautotrophic synthesis of
proteins, and hence enzymes, can be expected to be an energeti-
cally costly process in subseaﬂoor sediments. A key intermediate
during amino acid synthesis under anaerobic conditions is the
energy-rich acetyl CoA molecule, which is also a crucial inter-
mediate during acetogenesis. Assuming that acetogenesis from
H2–CO2 is associated with an energetic cost (Figure 1A), then
obligate lithoautotrophs, including many methanogens and sul-
fate reducers, which synthesize amino acids from H2 and CO2,
will spend signiﬁcant amounts of energy on the reductive synthe-
sis of acetyl CoA alone. By contrast, the majority of organotrophic
acetogenesis reactions are exergonic (Table 3). Most acetogens
may therefore be able to cut back energy expenditures during
enzyme synthesis, compared to obligately autotrophic organisms,
by using organic substrates to synthesize the amino acid precursor
acetyl CoA.

CONCLUSION
If energy yields per substrate are the only important variable
controlling microbial metabolism in energy-starved subsurface
sediments, then acetogenic microbes should be outcompeted by
other anaerobic microbes that perform energetically more favor-
able pathways, such as sulfate reduction and methanogenesis.
While this may be the case in some places, recent δ13C-isotopic
analyses that indicate a signiﬁcant acetogenic contribution to total
acetate turnover have suggested otherwise (Heuer et al., 2009;
Lever et al., 2010). In this study, I discuss several potentially advan-
tageous traits of acetogenic microbes that may enable them to
coexist with sulfate reducers and methanogens in spite of lower
energy yields per substrate.

Using conservative calculations, I show that most acetogenic
substrates are likely to occur at concentrations that vastly exceed
the thermodynamic threshold concentration for acetogenesis and
are thus potential energy substrates to acetogens in the deep bios-
phere. Due to their ability to metabolize certain substrates via

multiple different reactions, e.g., methanol alone, methanol+ H2,

or methanol+ formate, acetogens have a remarkable metabolic
ﬂexibility compared to sulfate reducers and methanogens, which
in some cases may enable them to gain higher energy yields per
substrate than these two groups. Acetogens also have a greater
metabolic versatility with respect to the number and breadth of
substrates utilized than sulfate reducers and methanogens. As a
result, they may avoid competition via niche differentiation, i.e.,
by feeding on substrates not utilized by most sulfate reducers or
methanogens. The greater substrate breadth furthermore means
that acetogens are able to access energy from a greater overall
number of substrates. Rather than evolving to become highly efﬁ-
cient and specialized consumers of abundant single substrates,
acetogens are therefore likely to be substrate generalists with the
capacity to draw on a large pool of less abundant (rare) substrates.
A further advantage of the acetogenic lifestyle may lie in the
ability of acetogens to curb energy spent on biosynthesis. Aceto-
gens use the reductive acetyl CoA pathway, the energetically least
costly of all C ﬁxation pathways. By using this pathway for both
energy production and biosynthesis, they may cut back on energy
that other groups spend on the maintenance of additional genes
and enzymes. Use of organic compounds rather than H2/CO2
as starting blocks of biomass synthesis may moreover enable

acetogens to circumvent energetically costly lithoautotrophic C
ﬁxation. Given the high energetic cost of amino acid synthesis
in deep subsurface sediments, and the fact that synthesis and
maintenance of enzymes for DNA and protein repair are likely
to be the main energy expenditures of microbes in starvation
mode, acetogens may be able to save crucial energy for survival
by virtue of the simplicity and versatility of their biochemical
pathway.

Given that the vast majority of cells in deep subsurface sedi-
ments are probably in starvation mode with generation times of
hundreds to thousands of years (Biddle et al., 2006; Jørgensen
et al., 2006), basic questions regarding the ecology of these organ-
isms remain unanswered. Are the cells found highly recalcitrant
survivors from surface environments, or have they adapted to the
conditions of extreme energy limitation? Have microbes actively
colonized sediments long after their accumulation, or have they
been present since their initial deposition? Irregardless of the
answers to these questions, it is likely that the ability of aceto-
gens to use wide substrate ranges and perform biosynthesis at low
energetic cost represent valuable survival traits in the deep bios-
phere – even if they did not originally evolve as adaptations to this
environment.
