Background: Direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and DNADNA hybridization have previously demon-
strated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (ORN). The purpose of our study was
to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible
after radiation therapy.
Design: Bacterial DNA was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six
cases), including one patient with relapse. 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified, cloned, transformed into
Escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives.
Results: From the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were detected, 27% of which have not been
cultivated. The predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were Campylobacter gracilis,
Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone FG014, uncultured bacterium clone RL178,
Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella spp. The study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria
present in ORN. In contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members
of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case.
Conclusions: Diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of ORN in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected
by culture independent molecular techniques. To better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the
therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with ORN is
necessary.

Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a late complication

and calculated risk to conventional radiation
therapy used in treatment of cancer in the
craniofacial skeleton. As a consequence, adverse effects
of radiation therapy affect normal tissue cells and the
vascular system of bone, cartilage, and soft tissue. The
complexity of
leaves the definition,
etiology, and pathogenesis of ORN unclear (1, 2). ORN
was earlier attributed to secondary infection in the
traumatized irradiated tissue following the non-healing
wounds and exposed bone (3, 4). Marx stated in 1983
that infection associated with ORN was only superficial

and secondary, and that the microorganisms found in
resections were surface contaminants. The statement was
based on a study that failed to describe microorganisms
in the medullar parts of the resections (5). Støre and
Olsen (6) demonstrated the existence of a diverse micro-
biota of the medullar parts of the mandible visualized by
scanning and transmission electron microscopy and by
DNADNA hybridization in a checkerboard assay (7).
The detection of anaerobes indicates that infection might
play an important role in the pathogenesis of ORN (6, 7).
Based on analysis of irradiated bone biopsies from a high
number of patients with post-operative complications,
Hansen et al. (1, 8) also demonstrated an association
between Actinomyces and infected osteoradionecrosis
(IORN). Nason and Chole (2) described formation of

biofilm in association with ORN of the temporal bone
after external beam radiation. Phylogenetic analysis of
complex bacterial communities in biofilms relies on the
sequences of housekeeping genes in bacteria, like the 16S
rRNA gene, and includes both the cultivable and not-yet
cultivable segment of the bacterial flora. By using modern
molecular techniques, studies have shown the breadth of
microbial diversity of the whole gastrointestinal tract in
health and disease, and it has been discovered that as
much as 50% of the oral (9) and 80% of the intestinal (10)
indigenous bacterial flora consist of uncultured phylo-
types. Detection of all members of the complex bacterial
communities is necessary to better understand the role of
infection in the pathogenesis of ORN. The aim of this
study was to use culture independent molecular techni-
ques to unveil the bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the
mandible after radiation therapy.

Materials and methods

Specimens and subjects
Eight specimens (six consecutive cases) from mandibular
ORN and one relapse subject were used in this study. All
subjects recruited for the study required a full segmental
resection larger than 5 cm during the course of treatment.
The participants received a conservative treatment regi-
men of local wound care and continuous treatment with
tetracycline (doxycycline 100 mg daily). In cases of
clinical exacerbation this dose was doubled, or a limited
supplementary regimen of clindamycin, 150 mg three
times daily, was prescribed.

Bone samples
All resections were made from the mandibular body
region. Deep medullar bone specimens were obtained
using sterile trepan burrs
(3 mm wide), collecting
bicortical cylinders from areas previously covered by
mucoperiost and at a minimum distance of 3 cm from any
surface exposed by oro-cutaneous fistulas. The cortical
segments were removed from the specimens and the
marrow part was suspended in 50 mM tris buffer (pH
7.6), and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8, for further analysis. The
size of the lesion in the specimen from subject 1 allowed
collection of two bicortical cylinders. The bone marrow
samples were analyzed separately to assess the reprodu-
cibility of
techniques. After primary
infection and the subsequent treatment, subject 2 experi-
enced a relapse resulting in a second resection. Specimens
of the primary infection (p) and the relapse infection (r)
were analyzed independently (Fig. 1).

the molecular

DNA extraction
The marrow part of small bone cylinders was ground in
liquid nitrogen to fine powder in a sterile mortar in a
laminar airflow cabinet. The powder was suspended in 50

mM tris-HCl and DNA was extracted from the bone
tissue samples by using the ChargeSwitch Forensic DNA
Purification Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according
to the protocol of the manufacturer.

Amplification of 16S rRNA gene
The 16S rRNA gene was amplified under standardized
conditions using a universal forward primer (5?-GAG
AGT TTG ATY MTG GCT CAG-3?) and a universal
reverse primer (5?-GAA GGA GGT GWT CCA RCC
GCA-3?) (11). PCR was performed with the GeneAmp
PCR systems 9700 (ABI, Foster City, CA). One microliter
of DNA template was added to a reaction mixture (final
volume, 50 ml) containing 20 pmol of each primer, 40
nmol of deoxytriphosphates, and 1 U of Platinum Taq
polymerase (Invitrogen). In a hot-start protocol, the
samples were preheated at 958C for 4 min, followed by
amplification under the following conditions: 958C for 45
s, 608C for 45 s, and 728C for 1.5 min, with an additional
5 s for each cycle. A total of 30 cycles were performed,
which was followed by a final elongation step at 728C for
15 min. The results of the PCR amplification were
examined by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. DNA
was stained with Ethidium bromide and visualized under
short-wavelength UV light.

Cloning procedures
Cloning of PCR-amplified DNA was performed with the
TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, transformation was
done with competent Escherichia coli TOP10 cells. The
transformed cells were plated onto Luria-Bertani agar
plates supplemented with kanamycin (50 mg/ml), and the
plates were incubated overnight at 378C. Colonies were
transferred to 70 ml of 10 mM tris-HCl. Correct sizes of
the inserts were determined in a PCR with a forward
primer M13 and a reverse primer M13 (Invitrogen). Prior
to sequencing, the amplified PCR 16S rRNA fragments
were purified and concentrated by using the QIAquick
PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

16S rRNA gene sequencing and data analysis
Purified DNA from the PCR was sequenced with an ABI
Prism cycle sequencing kit (BigDye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase FS,
GeneAmp PCR systems 2700 and 9700; ABI). The
protocol and primers used for sequencing have been
described previously (11). The sequencing reactions were
run on an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer (ABI). The number
of sequenced clones per sample ranged from 45 to 84,
with an average of 62.6 clones. A sequence of approxi-
mately 500 bases was obtained first to determine identity
or approximate phylogenetic position. For identification
of closest relatives, the sequences of the inserts were
compared to the 16S rRNA gene sequences of over

98% similarity. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by
the neighbor-joining method of Saitou and Nei (14).
TREECON, a software package for
the Microsoft

and drawing of evolutionary trees (15). We are aware of
the potential creation of 16S rRNA chimera molecules
assembled during the PCR (16). Chimeric sequences were
identified by using the Chimera Check program in the
Ribosomal Database Project, by treeing analysis, or by
base signature analysis. Sequences suspected or identified
as chimeric were excluded from phylogenetic construction
and analysis. Nucleotide sequences are available for

Results and discussion
Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (6)
demonstrated the presence of bacteria in marrow spaces
of the mandible. Another study based on DNADNA
hybridization (7)
from our group documented the
presence of cultivable bacterial flora in ORN specimens.
In the present study, eight specimens from six additional
subjects with ORN were selected for further analysis
with culture independent molecular
for
identification of both cultivable and not yet cultivable
bacteria. From a total of 438 clones, a diverse bacterial
flora of 59 taxa was detected from eight specimens of
ORN. Six phyla were identified,
including Firmicutes,
Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Spirochaetes,
and Bacteroidetes. Of
the identified bacteria, 27%
cannot be cultivated. The two bone marrow samples
collected from the lesion in subject 1 (1a, 1b) were
analyzed separately to test whether
the microbial
profiles of the same lesion were uniform or differed in
composition. The analyzed results show how the profiles
clustered (Fig. 1). They indicated that bicortical cylin-
ders when analyzed with sensitive molecular techniques
reveal representative microbial flora associated with the
actual lesion. The specimens analyzed from subject 2,
represented primary (2p) and relapse infection (2r) after
treatment (Fig. 1). The bacterial profile after primary
infection was dominated by Streptococcus anginosus,
Dialister spp. and Prevotella spp. S. anginosus is a
member of the indigenous flora of the gastrointestinal
tract, but has previously been detected in osteoarthritis,
endocarditis, spondylodiscitis, osteomyelitis, and sub-
dural empyema (1720). From the relapse specimen only
five bacterial species were identified compared to the 18
species detected in the primary infection. Members of
the normal oral
flora, such as Streptococcus oralis,
Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus sp. oral strain

7A, dominated among the species detected, indicating
an opportunistic situation due to treatment failure.

In the last decade, culture independent techniques have
underlined the need to include all members of
the
bacterial flora to understand the role of bacteria in
health and disease. Despite the challenges related to
DNA extraction from bone tissue, Fenollar et al. (21)
reported bacterial diversity, which included not cultivated
phylotypes, from 525 samples of infected bones and
joints. The bone and joint samples were collected from
the whole body. Their results confirmed previous findings
(7, 22) suggesting that anaerobes are underestimated and
can play a central role in polymicrobial
infections in
bone. From the ORN data in the present study, we also
recognized a predominance of anaerobes (Fig. 1). In
accordance to Fenollar et al. (21), who detected several
human pathogens not previously reported or rare in bone
and joint
infections, species like Parvimonas micra,
Peptoniphilus lacrimalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica,
and Prevotella buccalis (Fig. 1) were found in the present
study.

From the eight

specimens analyzed, Actinomyces
israelii was only detected at a low level in one subject
(Fig. 1). This result differed from a previous study from
our group, based on DNADNA hybridization, where
Actinomyces spp. were detected in all 12 specimens of
ORN (7). In a retrospective study of 50 subjects with
ORN of the jaws, Curi et al. (23) diagnosed Actinomyces
in six cases (12%) with ORN. From culture dependent
and histochemical techniques, Hansen et al. (1) found
Actinomyces colonies in 20 of 31 patients (64.5%) that
underwent high-dose irradiation with the typical clinical
symptoms of IORN. A semi-nested PCR testing based on
16S rRNA genes for the presence of Actinomyces species
was performed in three cases, which confirmed the
presence of A. israelii. In a material of head and neck
neoplasm where bone biopsies of radiographically af-
fected mandibulas were analyzed, Hansen et al.
(8)
demonstrated with histology Actinomyces spp. in 16 out
of 25 patients. The variation in Actinomyces recovery may
be ascribed to differences in techniques and microfloras.
Streptococcus intermedius was among the predominant
bacterial species detected in the present study (Fig. 1). S.
intermedius is a member of the indigenous bacterial flora
of the mouth and the upper respiratory tract. In the
healthy oral cavity, S.
intermedius is a commensal of
supra-/sub-gingival habitats of the teeth and in the crypts
of the tonsils (9). In addition to being a member of the
normal flora, S. intermedius is associated with pyogenic
infections
like endocarditis, pneumonia, abdominal,
or cerebral abscess (2427) Calza et al. (28) concluded
that S.
intermedius and the ‘milleri group’ should be
considered as elusive pathogens in osteomyelitis and
muscular abscess as well.

The present study defined diverse bacterial profiles of
specimens of ORN in marrow spaces of the mandible
through culture independent molecular techniques. Com-
plex bacterial communities, represented by cultivable and
not yet cultivable bacteria, in a wide range of bacterial
taxa, emphasize the need to include all the members of
putative pathogens for the future clinical management
and choice of antibacterial therapy in patients suffering
from ORN.
