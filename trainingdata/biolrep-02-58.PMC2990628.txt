Abstract
Centrioles organize both centrosomes and cilia. Centriole duplication is tightly regulated and
coordinated with the cell cycle to limit duplication to only once per cell cycle. Defects in centriole
number and structure are commonly found in cancer. Plk4/SAK and the functionally related
Caenorhabditis elegans ZYG-1 kinases initiate centriole duplication. Several recent studies have
elucidated the regulated activity of these kinases and potential downstream targets for centriole
assembly.

Introduction and context
Centriole assembly facilitates the formation of
two
centrosomes with a pair of resident centrioles at their
core, providing the basis for bipolar spindle organization
during mitosis. Duplication also ensures that each
daughter cell receives a pair of centrioles with one old,
mother centriole and one new, daughter centriole [1,2].

is competent

Centriole biogenesis occurs via a series of conserved
morphological stages that culminate in a cylindrical
structure that
to recruit pericentriolar
material for centrosome function and to nucleate cilia
(reviewed in [3-7]). The new daughter centriole is first
detected as an amorphous electron density and a
cartwheel adjacent to the proximal end of the mother
centriole. The cartwheel is composed of a central tubule
of approximately 25 nm in diameter and nine spokes
that extend outward from the central tubule. Triplet
microtubules form at the end of each spoke to form the
pro-centriole. The pro-centriole then matures into a
centriole by additional triplet microtubule growth and
the assembly of accessory molecular components and
structures.

The coiled-coil protein Sas6 is a conserved component of
central tubules that is essential for central tubule and,
ultimately, centriole formation [8-14]. In Drosophila,

overexpression of Sas6 initiates both central
tubule
and centriole formation, suggesting that this protein is
important for early centriole assembly, and possibly
limiting in the process [13,15]. Furthermore,
the
centriole functions of the cartwheel protein Bld10 [10],
and of SAS-4/CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated pro-
tein), which directs microtubule assembly [16-19], both
depend on prior Sas6 function in the pathway. It is this
core group of proteins (Sas6, Sas4 and Bld10) that make
up a conserved, ancestral module [20,21]. Cartwheels are
thought to be dynamic in that they are required to
initiate pro-centriole assembly but, in many cell types,
are no longer detected in mature centrioles [17,22].
Consistent with the central tubule loss from mature
centrioles, Sas6 also disappears with centriole matura-
tion in human cells whereas Sas6 and the central tubule/
cartwheel remain at centrioles in Chlamydomonas and
Tetrahymena, in which the cartwheel is detected in mature
centrioles [10,11,22].

for

A number of models exist
the licensing and
regulation of new centriole assembly (reviewed in
[1,2,23]). One conserved mechanism is the regulation
of centriole assembly by the Polo-like kinase Plk4/SAK,
and the functionally related kinase Caenorhabditis elegans
ZYG-1 [20,21,24-26]. Two recent studies have explored
the evolution of these protein kinases [20,21]. Here, we

review additional studies that begin to uncover the
regulation of Plk4/SAK/ZYG-1 and how these kinases
may directly activate Sas6.

Major recent advances
Regulating Plk4/SAK/ZYG-1 kinase activity
Plk4/SAK/ZYG-1 localizes to centrioles and centrosomes
and is required for normal duplication [24,25,27,28].
Active Plk4/SAK kinase is present at duplicating mother
centrioles during G1/S and the protein levels increase at
both centrioles into mitosis [29]. In addition to centriole
localization, Plk4/SAK protein levels are regulated and,
when aberrant, centriole assembly is either amplified or
decreased corresponding to levels of Plk4/SAK [30,31].
Defects resulting in either too much or too little Plk4/
SAK are deleterious and correlate with chromosome
instability (CIN) and cancer [32,33].

Importantly,

Plk4/SAK is a low abundance protein that is SCF/Slimb
ubiquitinated and targeted for destruction by the 26S
proteosome in Drosophila [34-36]. This destruction limits
centrosome/centriole amplification.
the
SCF-mediated destruction of Plk4/SAK is also affected
by its autophosphorylation at a phosphodegron motif
[37]. Thus, Plk4/SAK self-regulates its activity by phos-
phorylation to promote its own destruction. In addition
to protein destruction, Plk4/SAK phosphorylated in the
phosphodegron (S305) is differentially localized to the
centrosome pericentriolar material [29]. This may be a
mechanism of sequestration to further control
the
activation of centriole duplication. As Plk4/SAK kinase
activity increases, the protein becomes destroyed and re-
localized in a self-regulating mechanism to limit centriole
re-duplication. Plk4/SAK levels become highest during
mitosis. Finally, centrosome levels of C. elegans ZYG-1 are
also regulated by the conserved, putative RNA binding
protein SZY-20 [38]. Thus, the regulation of Plk4/SAK/
ZYG-1 appears to undergo multiple mechanisms of
regulated activity, reflecting the tight cell cycle coordina-
tion and potentially multiple cellular functions for these
kinases.

Capitalizing on the multiple mechanisms for regulating
Plk4/SAK/ZYG-1 kinases, variant activity is observed
depending on cell type and cell cycle differences. For
example, C. elegans ZYG-1 is differentially regulated
during mitosis and meiosis via dissimilar localization
dependencies and this may reflect both positive and
negative mechanisms for ZYG-1 activity in centriole
duplication [39].

ZYG-1 was recently found to phosphorylate SAS-6 at
Ser123 in C. elegans [40]. Ser123 is not a conserved
residue in the Sas6 protein family, suggesting that the site
of regulation is divergent, as are the kinases controlling
centriole duplication. Consistent with conservation in
the regulatory mechanism, however, HsSas6 localization
is, in part, regulated by Plk4 [22].

SAS-6 mutations that mimic the phosphorylation
(S123D) can restore centriole duplication in a partial
ZYG-1 knockdown [40] that would normally arrest cells
with monopolar spindles due to inhibition of centriole
duplication [28]. Despite its ability to compensate for a
partial loss of ZYG-1 function, the phospho-mimetic
SAS-6 mutant cannot rescue the complete loss of ZYG-1,
indicating that ZYG-1 has other roles in promoting
centriole duplication.

SAS-6 S123 phosphorylation is required for normal
SAS-6 maintenance at centrioles [40]. The protein
localization dynamics suggest a model in which SAS-6
phosphorylation is not required for recruitment
to
centrioles but S123 phosphorylation is required to
maintain SAS-6 at centrioles later in the cell cycle. This
is consistent with human studies where Plk4 is required
to maintain Sas6 at centrioles during mitosis and less so
during interphase [22].

Future directions
The coordination of centriole assembly with the cell cycle
is critical for regulated spindle assembly. A series of recent
studies describing the regulation and a downstream target
of Plk4/SAK/ZYG-1 protein kinases has begun to describe
the complexity of this process.

Perhaps the most intriguing feature of these studies is the
observation that Plk4/SAK activity peaks at mitosis and
promotes maintenance of Sas6 during this same time in
the cell cycle. While both of these proteins are clearly
important to initiate centriole assembly, multiple func-
tions are revealed by these studies. An added layer of
complexity also comes from the differences between ZYG-
1 regulation in mitotic and meiotic cells [39]. In addition
to its role in centriole function, Plk4’s cell division role
is likely to be more complex, with key functions in
cytokinesis. Plk4 may regulate Rho GTPase and cytokin-
esis by phosphorylating the Rho guanine nucleotide
exchange factor Ect2 [41]. Altered Plk4 activity may also
drive carcinogenesis by disrupting Plk4’s cytokinesis
function [41,42].

What are the Plk4/SAK/ZYG-1 kinase substrates?
The target(s) of Plk4/SAK/ZYG-1 phosphorylation for
centriole assembly is not well understood. However,

Finally, the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms
of Sas6 may have unique properties to facilitate both
central tubule assembly and other functions that remain

to be discovered. New central tubule formation for the
initiating stages appears to not require Sas6 phosphoryla-
tion. Along these lines, such modification may negatively
regulate the Sas6 oligomerization that can generate tubule
formation in vitro [43]. The differential phospho-Sas6
may be required for centriole maturation to form a stable
structure. Beyond its regulation are questions concerning
how Sas6 contributes to central tubule formation and the
creation of ninefold radial symmetry in attachment of the
cartwheel spokes to the central tubule.
