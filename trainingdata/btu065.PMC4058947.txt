Despite mounting evidence that genetic subgroups of the same clinical dis- ease exist, little attention has been given to exploring how this hetero- geneity time-to-event model building and how to accommodate it.
Methods able to diagnose and model heterogeneity should be valuable additions to the biomarker discovery toolset.
Results: We propose a mixture of survival functions that classifies subjects with similar relationships to a time-to-event response.
This model incorporates multivariate regression and model selection and can be fit with an expectation maximization algorithm, we call Cox- assisted clustering.
We illustrate a likely manifestation of genetic het- erogeneity and demonstrate how it may affect survival models with little warning.
An application to gene expression in ovarian cancer DNA repair pathways illustrates how the model may be used to learn new genetic subsets for risk stratification.
We explore the implications of this model for censored observations and the effect on genomic pre- dictors and diagnostic analysis.

In ovarian cancer, for example, Vaughan et al.
(2011) argue that the set of patients with the same clinical disease have distinct molecular diseases.
With respect to inference, this implies that the same regression models may not be valid for every patient and further that it is unclear which patients should be considered together (Ko  bel et al., 2008).
Therefore, a major statistical task is to organize patients into previously unknown classes while sim- ultaneously fitting their time-to-event models.
*To whom correspondence should be addressed.
The examples throughout the article are taken from our on- going analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which has the goal of cataloging all of the genomic alterations in cancer.
For each patient, there is a tremendous amount and var- iety of data: 12 000 genes in expression arrays, 1 million single- nucleotide polymorphism genotypes, exome and whole-genome sequences, methylation of thousands of CpG islands and the expression of microRNA.
From this plurality of data, we antici- pate that exploratory methods will serve to extract and charac- terize genetic subgroups relevant time clinical outcomes.
to survival  For summarizing the impact of a genetic signature, one often stratifies patients to demonstrate separation between class- defined survival curve estimates.
Unfortunately, as Na et al.
(2009) review, current methods either awkwardly dichotomize a continuous score at a post hoc threshold or rely on hierarchical clustering to define subgroups with no necessary relation to sur- vival.
In that sense, it is desirable to have a method that identifies genetic subgroups supervised by their survival times.
The standard methods for dealing with non-homogenous time-to-event data do not apply when our goal is to discover unknown subgroups.
Continuous frailty models (Aalen, 1988) treat all individuals separately and therefore do not produce sub- groups.
O Quigley and Stare (2002) emphasize the use of random effects and stratified regression models when subgroups are known.
Classification and regression tree methods have been adapted for survival responses (Lostritto et al., 2012  Segal, 1988).
However, these methods partition the predictor space to form a single piecewise functional estimate, and our interest is in the subgroups that exist in similar regions.
Some treatment of heterogeneity relevant to survival time where a subgroup of patients does not expire appears in the cure rate model literature (Farewell, 1982).
Our situation is dis- tinct in three ways: a subgroup may have variable time-to-event outcomes (cured patients have infinite survival times), the vari- ables of interest to each mixture component may be distinct and the set of patients in each subgroup is not known.
In this article, we propose a discrete mixture regression model that synergizes with potential heterogeneity in time-to-event data.
Concretely, we assume that observations belong to un- labeled classes with class-specific proportional hazards (PH) re- gression models relating their genetic covariates to survival time outcomes (Section 3).
This conditional semi-parametric model leads to a surprising variety of model effects, which we illustrate  ß The Author 2014.

In Section 4, we describe an algorithm and the considerations for fitting the model.
Simulations highlight the use of censored data (Section 5) and a data analysis demonstrates a single-pathway hypothesis-driven model (Section 6).
Our dis- cussion (Section 7) again emphasizes the exploratory role that this analysis may address.
2 ILLUSTRATIONS  2.1 Genetic heterogeneity  There is evidence that distinct molecular subgroups lead to the same clinical presentation of ovarian cancer (Cooke et al., 2010  Ko  bel et al., 2008  Konstantinopoulos et al., 2008  Vaughan et al., 2011).
This form of genetic heterogeneity may arise be- cause the commonalities leading to cancer may aggregate within pathways and not on the level of genes (Jones et al., 2008).
In the following case study, we highlight the ability of the mixture to produce unusual associations between covariates and survival and how it may augment our understanding of subgroup discovery.
Suppose that X   Nð0, 1Þ represents a single typical normal- ized gene expression measurement and that patients do have survival times arising from two distinct hazard models, h1ðtjxÞ ¼ h0ðtÞ expð 2xÞ and h2ðtjxÞ ¼ h0ðtÞ expðþ2xÞ.
These hazards represent an extreme version of heterogeneity in  expression  in one class, the gene has a protective effect and in the other it is equally deleterious.
Assuming the baseline hazard is exponential ðh0ðtÞ ¼ 1Þ, we generate 1000 complete survival times, Y, under each of these hazards and plot them on the log scale with their randomly gen- erated expression in Figure 1A.
Without knowledge of the true classes, fitting a standard Cox regression to these data finds no significant relationship between Y and X ( ^  ¼  0:0314, P ¼ 0:1).
This effect is strong enough that the relationship is easily identified the true classes are known ( ^ 1 ¼ 1:93, P50:001 and if ^ 2 ¼  2:12, P50:001).
A standard diagnostic technique to estimate non-linear rela- tionships between Y and X is to use a smoothing estimate on the added variable plot (Fig.
1B).
In this case, it fails to identify any important effects.
Estimating a time-varying effect is another diagnostic for assessing PH (Grambsch and Therneau, 1994).
Again it does not discern any non-proportional effect (P ¼ 0:116) or time-varying effect (Fig.
1C).
So, by the standard analyses, this important gene would not be identified for further study.
With respect to gene expression analyses, this is a case where differential expression (DE) models that look for mean difference will fail: there is no true underlying survival difference between classes that may be attributed to X (Fig.
1D).
This means that models that try to estimate a rule 1fX4cg that can classify patients are not applicable.
So, the mixture reflects a different way to  A  C  B  D  Fig.

The question remains about whether this kind of example exists in real data.
We present a gene that does just this in the following illustration.
different survival experiences.
The mixture model should let us estimate labels and should be able to resolve non-PH.
2.2 Cytoreduction and epiregulin  We draw known class labels from a measured surgical covariate, which is presently used as a biomarker.
Cytoreduction, the amount of tumor remaining after surgery, is a measure of success of surgical debulking, which is a component of primary therapy in ovarian cancer.
Patients who are suboptimally cytoreduced have a clinically significant amount of residual tumor that will seed future recurrent disease and progression (Bhoola and Hoskins, 2006).
Using the TCGA study to be introduced in Section 6, we sep- arate the patients into optimal and suboptimal categories and provide a kernel smoothing estimate of their hazards (Fig.
2).
The estimated hazards are clearly non-proportional [P¼ 0.007, Grambsch and Therneau (1994)], reflecting the early protective effect of optimal cytoreduction and its transient nature.
Fitting separate models in each subgroup, we searched for genes whose relationship with survival inverts over classes finding epir- egulin (interaction P¼ 0.004), which has been recently highlighted as a progression marker (Amsterdam et al., 2011).
In optimally cytoreduced patients, increased expression is detrimental to sur- vival ( ^  ¼ 0:156, P ¼ 0:014)  in suboptimal patients, increased expression is protective ( ^  ¼  0:452, P ¼ 0:012).
In Figure 2, we have plotted the estimated survival for high and low epiregulin expression for optimal and suboptimal patients.
Noting that epir- egulin has been shown to inhibit epithelial tumor cells and stimu- late cancer-associated fibroblasts (Toyoda et al., 1995), the surgical outcomes may indicate a more epithelial or more fibrous tumor  a fair biological explanation is that epiregulin expression leads to the inhibition of tumor burden (a better prognostic out- come), or the stimulation of fibroblasts that leads to cancer progression.
Thus, these effects do exist and imply surprisingly deep biolo- gical connections.
Following a genomic survey, this type of effect is an ideal target for functional studies.
Given that we want to identify genetic subgroups with different prognoses, we should favor a model that admits unknown and possibly dramatically  survival  3 METHODS Let ðYi,  i, xiÞ, i ¼ 1, .

To account for heterogeneity, we propose that each patient arises from k  k ¼ 1. one of K latent classes with probability  k, k ¼ 1, .

(2011).
In particular, recall that a right- censored observation following a PH model has the density fkðy,  jxÞ ¼ h0kðyÞ expðx0 kÞ   exp  H0kðyÞ expðx0 kÞ Y X  ð1Þ where h0kðtÞ and H0kðtÞ are the baseline hazard and baseline cumulative hazard for the kth class.

The discrete mixture leads to the model s interpretation as organizing observations into clusters that are not known a priori.
This type of clus- tering should not be confused with clustered survival data, which typically refers to the case where class labels identifying multiple observations from the same source (e.g.
treatment centers or year of diagnosis) are known.
Instead, observations are gathered according to their best-fitting regres- sion model.
Additionally, our mixture relaxes the PH assumption  we only need to assume that hazards are proportional within their given clusters.
The practical interpretation of this property is highlighted in the example given in Section 2.2.

Smoothed hazard rate estimates stratified on optimal and suboptimal cytoreduction classes show a non-proportional relationship.
We identify gene epiregulin whose relationship to survival inverts across these underlying classes  1692   models (O Quigley and Stare, 2002) are other common methods for accommodating heterogeneity, but they still rely on the PH framework.
In addition to presenting a novel approach for handling heterogeneity and subgroup discovery for time-to-event data, our approach offers a new contribution to the finite mixture model literature (McLachlan and Peel, 2000  Fru  hwirth-Schnatter, 2006).
The problem of finite mixtures has been explored in mixed effects models (Qin and Self, 2006), general- ized linear models (Wedel and DeSarbo, 1995) and discrete-time survival models (Muthe  n and Masyn, 2005)  our approach extends the idea to PH regression.
4 ALGORITHM: COX-ASSISTED CLUSTERING     We refer to the following algorithm for maximizing the mixture   likelihood as Cox-assisted clustering (CAC).
For convenience, we write the parameters to be estimated as   ¼ ð 1,  2, .

.
.
, h0KðtÞ , the set of baseline hazard functions and   ¼ ð 1, .
.
.
,  KÞ, the coefficient vectors.
We further abbreviate the hazards at their evaluation points: h0ki ¼ h0kðYiÞ and H0ki ¼ H0kðYiÞ.
The complete data likelihood with mixing parameters   and class-specific parameters h and   may be separated into a mixing distribution part and a component distribution part: log Lð , h,    Y,  , UjxÞ ¼ log L1ð   UÞ þ log L2ðh,    Y,  jU, xÞ: The first is simply  !
X  n  X  K  log L1ð   UÞ ¼  uik  log  k,  k¼1  i¼1  ð4Þ  and the likelihood associated with the component distributions is  X log L2ðh,    Y,  jU, xÞ ¼  X  K  n  k¼1  i¼1   iuik log h0ki þ  iuikx0    i k   uikH0ki exp x0  i k     ð5Þ  :  To compute the maximum likelihood estimate, we follow an EM approach that estimates and optimizes the observed data log likelihood by plugging ^uik ¼ EðuikjYi,  i, xÞ into the complete data likelihood.
Supposing that the current values of the param- ðmÞ eters at the mth iteration are   k , the algo- rithm proceeds as follows.
ðmÞ 0ki and    ðmÞ 0ki , H  ðmÞ k , h  h      h ðmÞ 0ki exp x0 i  h ðmÞ 0k0i exp x0 i  h  ðmÞ k     h i h   i exp  H exp  H   i   i  ðmÞ k0  ðmÞ 0ki expðx0 i  ðmÞ 0k0i expðx0 i   ðmÞ k Þ ðmÞ k0 Þ  i  i  ð6Þ  In the E-step, conditional mean is  P ^uik ¼   k0  ðmÞ k  ðmÞ k0     after the application of Bayes rule.
We note that, unlike the standard Cox regression setting, computing the baseline hazard is necessary to compute the conditional means.
It can be shown that if we assume a common baseline hazard across clusters, the E-step update depends only on the current estimates of   and  .
In the M-step, the update for mixing proportions  k is  straightforward:  P  n  ðmþ1Þ k     ¼  ^uik  i¼1 n  :  ð7Þ  Cox-assisted clustering  To update h, we make a profile likelihood argument that leads to a partial likelihood (Johansen, 1983).
Suppose we hold  k constant.
Maximizing over h0k, we obtain profile estimates of the hazards as a function of the   that are similar to Breslow (1974):  ðmþ1Þ k  ðmþ1Þ h 0k  P ðYiÞ ¼ X  j:Yj Yi  ðmþ1Þ 0k  H  ðYiÞ ¼  ðmþ1Þ k  Þ  ^uik  ^ujk expðx0 j  P  ^ulk  l:Yl Yi  j:Yj Yl  ^ujk expðx0 j   ðmþ1Þ k  Þ:  ð8Þ  ð9Þ  The profiled M-step objective is a partial likelihood weighted  by the ^uik:    X    log L2 hð Þ,    Y,  , ^Ujx X  8  : ^uikxi0  k   log  K  n  ¼   i  k¼1  i¼1  X     exp ^ujkxj0  k  j:Yj Yi     9=  :  ð10Þ  ðmþ1Þ k  Each component indexed by k may be maximized separately to obtain the   update using standard statistical software.
The M-step is operationally equivalent to fitting K-weighted Cox models.
Finally, one iterates between the E and M step until the increment in log-likelihood is small.
4.1 Starting conditions and number of classes  As an iterative procedure, the EM algorithm requires initial values  ð0Þ,  ð0Þ.
For analyses that begin with strong biological hypotheses, the corresponding parameters may be set directly.
An alternative is to choose starting parameters by assigning ob- servations to specific classes and estimating the initial  ð0Þ and  ð0Þ.
This is equivalent to setting an initial value for every ^uik and running the algorithm forward.
This assignment may be random  one may set a randomly selected ^uik to 0.8, say, and divide the remaining weight among the other classes.
In practice, we use multiple random starts and pick the best by the fitted log- likelihood.
As in other clustering problems (Fraley and Raftery, 1998), we select the number of classes using the Bayesian information cri- terion (BIC).
Let LðKÞ ¼ LðhK,  K,  K  Y,  , UjxÞ, where we have added the K subscript to emphasize the dependence.
The BIC criterion is expressed as  BICðKÞ ¼  2 log LðKÞ þ pK logðnÞ,  ð11Þ  where p is the dimension of X and n is the number of observed patients.
The value of K minimizing BIC(K) is a penalized com- P promise between fit and complexity.
Also, while Volinsky and Raftery (2000) propose weighting by the number of observed events, logð i  iÞ, because logðnÞ is always larger, the standard BIC is a more conservative criterion.
As a measure of model sensitivity to additional clusters, we consider an adaption of the DFBETA statistic (Hamilton, 1992).
Given a model fit for K classes, each patient i can be assigned a  1693   K.H.Eng and B.M.Hanlon  parameter vector  ð  u component j, we simply consider the average change over K:  ðKÞ i  .
For each       ðKÞ i     X  Þ given their assigned class,  u          ðK 1Þ    j  u i ðK 1Þ  u i  ðKÞ  u i            i¼1   j   j  n          DFBETAðj, KÞ ¼ n 1  ð12Þ  This statistic will be large when the coefficients change dra- matically between cluster numbers.
Conversely, if the (Kþ 1)th cluster simply subdivides an existing cluster, the statistic will be small.
5 SIMULATION STUDIES   i  time for  the ith patient  Although there are several properties of the model and algorithm to highlight, we focus on its treatment of censored data and a demonstration of its estimation ability.

As is common in gene expression studies, we will work with scaled and centered X, so   reflects the sensitivity of the analysis to this standardization.
The relationship between survival and X is controlled by     0, where the first class has  1 ¼   and the second class has  2 ¼   .
The survival then Ti ¼ expðXi ðUiÞÞ where  i   Exponentialð1Þ.
The censoring time is generated from Ci   Uniformð0,  Þ, where   depends on the choice of   and   and a target censoring rate.
Finally, the observed survival time is Yi ¼ minðTi, CiÞ.
We set n¼ 200 patients in each class and set   ¼ 3 so that  1 ¼ þ3 and  2 ¼  3.
We target 40% censoring by setting   ¼ expð0:99Þ for   ¼ 0 and   ¼ expð12:83Þ for   ¼ 5.
For this simulation, we run our algorithm at the true number of clusters K¼ 2.
We study the same scenarios over 1000 simulations.
In Table 1, we report the estimated  k (choosing ^ 1   ^ 2 for iden- tifiability) alongside the oracle estimator that knows the true classes.
Intuitively, if the data are perfectly classified, the oracle estimate will have properties consistent with the well-studied Cox model estimate.
Thus, the accuracy, the proportion of patients  is  Table 1.

Considering the standard Cox model in this heterogeneity setting, the median parameter esti- mate for the   ¼ 0 case is 1.8e-05 (range  0.26 0.28) implying that heterogeneity has masked all detectable association with the covariate of interest.
P  The results imply that the clustering algorithm works well des- pite heavy censoring and mean mis-specification.
We note a bias toward larger absolute parameter estimates ( CAC, 14 oracle, 1) that we believe comes from the algorithm greedily reinforcing what it has already learned.
A censoring bias in the   ¼ 5 scen- ario appears as  CAC, 2 is smaller than it should be  this group is more likely to be censored so it has a lower effective sample size.
Variation in per cluster censoring rates is a novel data consider- ation, and we recommend tracking the number of events in each cluster (see for example Section 6).
When the cluster sizes are i Ui   Binomial ð2n, 1=2Þ, the estimates are simi- generated by lar and the standard errors increase reflecting the variation in Ui (Supplementary Material).
To consider the ability of CAC to identify heterogeneity, we tested the above   ¼ 0 scenario with the DFBETA statistic noting that DFBETA(K¼ 2) is greater than DFBETA(K¼ 3) in all cases  the median DFBETA(K¼ 2) was 60 (IQR: 92), implying the model was much more sensitive to two clusters than one, whereas the median DFBETA(K¼ 3) was 0.91 (IQR: 0.21), sufficient.
Conversely, if we generate data where all patients come from the than DFBETA(K¼ 3) in 61.2% of cases with medians 0.83 and 0.81, respectively.
This implies that, along with appropriate con- text and judgment, the DFBETA statistic is a useful tool for diagnosing heterogeneity.

The study collected banked surgical samples from n¼ 503 patients with highly annotated clinical follow-up whose cancers had been surgically debulked and who had been treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (Bhoola and Hoskins, 2006).
Platinum resistance is an important concept in the treatment of ovarian cancer because these cancers respond poorly to any type of chemotherapy (Bookman, 2005).
Although resistance is not an ideal predictive marker because it is defined through treat- ment, the development of an independently queried molecular model is precisely the promise of a large repository study like TCGA.
One unaddressed complication is the expectation of genetic heterogeneity: patients with similar survival outcomes may have dissimilar molecular profiles.
If this heterogeneity appears to take the form of subgroups and mixtures (as in the illustra- tions), we anticipate that our model and algorithm will be able to address it.
Therefore, we demonstrate the use of our model to explore possibly heterogenous data by modeling a potential mechanism of platinum resistance in TCGA patients.
Because recent reviews of resistance highlight the homologous repair pathway for repair- ing DNA damage (Martin et al., 2008  Cooke and Brenton, 2011), we focus on modeling the function of this set of genes.
The homologous repair pathway is defined by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation (hsa:03440) (Kanehisa et al., 2010) and corresponds to 27 unique gene symbols.
We fit our model for K ¼ 2, .
.
.
, 10 using 100 random starts for each K and selecting the best fit by log likelihood.
By BIC, we select K¼ 5 clusters (Supplementary Material).
Survival times are truncated at 60 months of observation to reduce the influence of 76 patients who are observed beyond the time of interest.
In total, 186 of 503 (37%) patients are censored before 60 months.
Table 2 describes the quality of the cluster fits by the relative i ^uik), the number of patients assigned weight of each cluster ( (n) and the mean posterior probability for patients in their as- signed clusters.
The number of events in each cluster and the restricted mean (up to 60 months) are listed.
P  We observe that, although they have the largest number of patients assigned, clusters 4 and 5 have the smallest mean pos- terior probabilities, implying that their members are less similar internally.
The clustering appears to be driven by the poor prog- nosis patients in clusters 1, 2 and 3.
Noting the presence of cross- ing survival functions, the five class log-rank test is significant (P¼ 1.26e-09).
With respect to low posterior probabilities, we observe that the algorithm makes intuitively reasonable use of the censored ob- servations.
We plot the maximum posterior probability for each patient by their survival time in Figure 3A.
Because censored patients do not have definitive events, the algorithm is less cer- tain about which cluster to assign them.
Patients with the least follow-up time have maximum posterior probability close to 0.2 (i.e.
1 of 5), and as they are observed, longer the certainty of their maximum assigned cluster rises.
To wit, the hardest to classify patients are the least observed.
Within each cluster, we check model diagnostics and look for influential points.
Noting that there was moderate evidence (P ¼ 0:059) for non-PH (Grambsch and Therneau, 1994) when considering all the patients as a single group, after fitting our model, the within-cluster tests are all strongly insignificant.
All influence statistics for all genes in each cluster are smaller than 1 standard deviation, implying no leverage points.
Because the mixture allows different clusters to have different in Figure 3B, we used a kernel baseline hazard functions, smoothing algorithm to visualize their estimates (Mu  ller and Wang, 1994).
We emphasize the non-proportionality of the haz- ards for clusters 3 and 5: patients in cluster 3 have a sudden acceleration in their hazard after 30 months, which may be con- sistent with the loss of effect in platinum chemotherapy.
In Figure 3C, we have plotted the estimated coefficients for clusters 3 and 5.
Keeping in mind that the linear predictor in the Cox model scales hazard relative to the cluster-specific baseline hazard, we highlight coefficients ð 3,  5Þ ¼ ðþ7:13,   5:90Þ imply that it has a strong deleterious effect in cluster 3 (exacerbating the jump in hazard), while it has a strong protective effect in cluster 5.

RPA3 ð 0:96, þ 6:24Þ, which only increases risk in cluster 5, and TOP3A ð 7:54,   0:54Þ, which is protective in cluster 3 only.
At this point in the analysis, these genes are good candidates for follow-up studies: we have identified their effect specific to a subgroup of patients.
Further, the clustering model may still recover a sense of DE for survival data.
Because we have learned risk classes, we may consider DE across clusters.
We focus on DE across clusters 3 and 5, SHFM1 (Bonferroni adjusted t-test, P¼ 0.011), RPA3 (P¼ 0.011) and RAD51L3 (P¼ 0.020), all have significant shifts in expression.
Notably, RPA4 and TOP3A do not show significant DE, implying that they fit into the class of variables that only differ in regression model effects.
Representative of prognostic signature development, Kang et al.
(2012) conducted a study of selected DNA repair pathways and produced a risk signature in this dataset.
To compare with their model (using 151 genes across eight pathways) and a typical Cox model approach (using the 27 gene homologous repair path- way), we stratified patients based on survival to 3.7 years [as in Kang et al.
(2012)] and produced receiver operating characteris- tic plots for all of the signatures (Fig.
4A).
While the standard Cox model underperforms at area under the curve (AUC) 0.61 (comparable with a clinically derived model reported by Kang and colleagues), the K¼ 5 CAC model has AUC 0.73 compar- able with Kang s model (AUC 0.70).
The key advantage of the CAC approach is the ability to de- scribe risk sets.
By itself, the Cox model describes continuous risk and must be dichotomized post hoc for survival curve plots of high- and low-risk subsets.
In Figure 4B, we have illustrated the typical continuous risk score plot that describes sensitivity of high- and low-risk sets to the cutpoint.
The CAC model naturally separates patients into risk classes (clusters 3 and 5 are high- lighted, Fig.
4C) and these can be further described by processing their continuous risk scores.
Based on our analysis, we conjecture that we are able to iden- tify a subgroup of patients (cluster 3) who experience a signifi- cant increase in hazard around month 30.
We are able to identify genes whose expression leads to increased risk specific to a sub- group or whose relationship inverts across clusters.
There is a tremendous amount of untapped information remaining in the fitted model.
For example, every pairwise comparison between clusters their holistic  should be informative as well as  1695   K.H.Eng and B.M.Hanlon  A  B  C  Fig.

7 DISCUSSION  In this article, we have presented a model for heterogeneity in time-to-event data.
Although its actual formulation is straight- forward, the treatment of unknown classification, a consider- ation of the implications for censoring, the effect on genomic predictors and diagnostic analysis have not been previously con- sidered.
Finally, we have presented a novel and informative ana- lysis in Section 6, which begins to identify the set of survival- associated and subgroup-dependent alterations in expression.
Admirably, this model relaxes the whole model PH assump- tion to conditional PH given cluster membership.
In an explora- tory situation, the utility of this flexibility cannot be overstated.
Both our simulated and applied analysis highlight that our understanding of censoring has been augmented and the use of information in the model is intuitively simple.
In a data analytic view, informaticists are familiar with un- supervised clustering analysis and class-label supervised cluster- ing analysis.
Our algorithm may be seen as a way to use a survival time (possibly censored) to supervise the clustering of gene expression data.
This clustering property is distinct from ensemble-type methods [e.g.
Jordan and Jacobs (1994)], where  covariate information may be used to reweight components.
As we saw with its treatment of posterior class probabilities, the mixture believes each observation comes from a single compo- nent, while averaging over weak learners or hidden layers may be relevant to a more admixed sample.
With respect to developing ovarian cancer biomarkers, our data analysis has shown an example where class identification leads to risk stratification.
We might further identify high- and low-risk classes within the assigned clusters as is standard prac- tice, but this is no longer a required post-processing part of the expression analysis.
The CAC algorithm has also given us its posterior weights allowing a concrete measure of uncertainty for downstream analyses.
In the TCGA project, as in many other cancer genomic stu- dies, there are issues of both high-dimensional data and variable selection.
As presented, the CAC regression framework does not incorporate these, but it can be extended with additional study.
