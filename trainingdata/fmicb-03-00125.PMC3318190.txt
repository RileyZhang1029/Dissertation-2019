Bacteria are key in the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which
are widespread environmental pollutants. At least six genotypes of PAH degraders are
distinguishable via phylogenies of the ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase (RHD) that initiates
bacterial PAH metabolism. A given RHD genotype can be possessed by a variety of bacterial
genera, suggesting horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important process for dissemi-
nation of PAH-degrading genes. But, mechanisms of HGT for most RHD genotypes are
unknown. Here, we report in silico and functional analyses of the phenanthrene-degrading
bacterium Delftia sp. Cs1-4, a representative of the phnAFK2 RHD group.The phnAFK2 geno-
type predominates PAH degrader communities in some soils and sediments, but, until now,
their genomic biology has not been explored. In the present study, genes for the entire
phenanthrene catabolic pathway were discovered on a novel ca. 232 kb genomic island
(GEI), now termed the phn island. This GEI had characteristics of an integrative and con-
jugative element with a mobilization/stabilization system similar to that of SXT/R391-type
GEI. But, it could not be grouped with any known GEI, and was the ﬁrst member of a new
GEI class. The island also carried genes predicted to encode: synthesis of quorum sensing
signal molecules, fatty acid/polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis, a type IV secretory sys-
tem, a PRTRC system, DNA mobilization functions and >50 hypothetical proteins. The
50% G+ C content of the phn gene cluster differed signiﬁcantly from the 66.7% G+ C
level of the island as a whole and the strain Cs1-4 chromosome, indicating a divergent
phylogenetic origin for the phn genes. Collectively, these studies added new insights into
the genetic elements affecting the PAH biodegradation capacity of microbial communities
speciﬁcally, and the potential vehicles of HGT in general.

INTRODUCTION
Bacteria are key agents affecting the fate and behavior of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are widespread environ-
mental pollutants. At least six genotypes of PAH degraders have
been identiﬁed from phylogenies of the ring-hydroxylating dioxy-
genase (RHD) that initiates PAH metabolism (Moser and Stahl,
2001). The RHD genotypes also show conservation in the orga-
nization of other PAH degradation enzymes that are associated
with the RHD (Moser and Stahl, 2001; Stolz, 2009). A given RHD
genotype can be possessed by a variety of bacterial genera, sug-
gesting horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important process
for dissemination of PAH-degrading genes. Moreover, the RHD
genotypes have characteristic patterns of distribution, and typi-
cally occur within genera of a single bacterial family (Moser and

Stahl, 2001), possibly reﬂecting different pathways of gene ﬂow
that are operative within differing phylogenetic groups. Informa-
tion on such pathways is limited, but their elucidation is essen-
tial to understand processes shaping the function of microbial
communities.

Information on mechanisms of HGT in proteobacterial PAH
degraders is mostly derived from analyses of sphingomonads
(Romine et al., 1999; Demaneche et al., 2004; Stolz, 2009), and
species of Pseudomonas (Dennis and Zylstra, 2004; Li et al., 2004;
Basu and Phale, 2008; Heinaru et al., 2009). For both, studies
have focused on plasmids. In Pseudomonas, PAH-degrading genes
are characteristically of the nah phylotype, which are invariably
located on IncP-9 plasmids. Complete sequencing of one such ele-
ment, pDTG1, revealed all nah genes were contained within a Tn3-
like transposon (Dennis and Zylstra, 2004), potentially providing
a means of intracellular gene movement as well. But, although
IncP-9 plasmids have a host range that spans the alpha-, beta-, and
gamma-proteobacteria (Suzuki et al., 2010), these elements have
not yet been identiﬁed to carry PAH-degrading genes beyond the
genus Pseudomonas. Plasmids of the sphingomonads show a sim-
ilar pattern, and are limited to that group. Thus, mechanisms of
HGT for other RHD genotypes are largely unknown.

The phn island

Many vehicles of HGT exist as elements integrated into bacterial
chromosomes rather than autonomously replicating plasmids, and
are termed integrating conjugative elements (ICE) or genomic
islands (GEI). High throughput sequencing has revealed that GEI
are wide spread in bacterial genomes, and can encode a variety of
adaptive traits (van der Meer and Sentchilo, 2003; Dobrindt et al.,
2004; Mario et al., 2009). However, while there has been exten-
sive study of GEI associated with pathogenicity-related functions,
comparatively little is known about GEI that confer other types
of phenotypes, including biodegradation activities. To date, the clc
element is the only biodegradation-related GEI examined in some
detail, and it is a pKLC102/PAGI-type GEI (Toleman and Walsh,
2011) that encodes degradation of chlorocatechols/aminophenols
(Gaillard et al., 2006). Involvement of GEI in PAH biodegradation
has not been examined, although these are now being revealed by
genome sequencing projects. For example, in Alteromonas sp. SN2
(Jin et al., 2011), genes for an nah-type RHD are carried on 100 kb
Tn3-like transposon, a structure similar to that of the nah genes
on pDTG1. Also, in Polaromonas naphthalenivorans CJ2, nag -type
RHD genes are associated with an unclassiﬁed GEI (Yagi et al.,
2009).

Recently, genomes were determined for two bacteria of the
phnAFK2 genotype: Delftia sp. Cs1-4 (closed genome sequence) and
Burkholderia sp. Ch1-1 (shotgun genome sequence). The phnAFK2
genotype is interesting as it has appeared as a predominant class
of PAH degraders in surveys of some soils and marine sediments
(Lozada et al., 2008; Ding et al., 2010), but relatively little is known
about this group. To date, the most extensive genetic informa-
tion about the phnAFK2 genotype has been limited to a ca. 24 kb
GenBank entry (AB024945) from Alcaligenes faecalis AFK2 that
included genes for the RHD and nine downstream enzymes. This
GenBank entry, however, was not associated with any empirical
evidence for the predicted functionality, which as yet remains un-
established. Furthermore, while HGT of the phnAFK2 genotype is
indicated by its structural conservation across multiple genera, the
vehicle(s) mediating transfer are unknown.

Here, we present the ﬁrst genomic and functional analyses of
the phnAFK2 genotype. The studies focused on the closed sequence
of Delftia sp. Cs1-4 and, where relevant, additional analyses were
done with Burkholderia sp. Ch1-1. Our ﬁndings included: elu-
cidation of a new ca. 232 kb GEI that encoded the entire path-
way for PAH (phenanthrene) catabolism, discovery of four new
genes associated with PAH degradation and elucidation of a novel
operon structure for a key pathway enzyme (o-phthalate dioxy-
genase). Collectively, these studies provided new insights into
the evolutionary and metabolic processes associated with PAH
degradation and HGT in microbial communities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
BACTERIAL STRAINS, PLASMIDS, AND CULTURE CONDITIONS
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table
S1 in Supplementary Material. Burkholderia sp. strain Ch1-1 and
Delftia sp. strain Cs1-4 were isolated from PAH-contaminated soil
collected in Chippewa Falls, WI, USA, based on their abilities to
grow on phenanthrene as sole carbon source (Vacca et al., 2005).
Cells of strain Ch1-1 and Cs1-4 were routinely grown on min-
eral salt medium (MSM; Hickey and Focht, 1990) supplemented
with phenanthrene as a sole carbon source (1 g/l) and incubated

at 25˚C with shaking at 150 rpm. When pyruvate was used as a
substrate, it was added to MSM from a ﬁlter-sterilized stock to a
ﬁnal concentration of 50 mM. E. coli strains were grown at 28 or
37˚C on Luria–Bertani (LB) medium supplemented as appropriate
with antibiotics. The PAH were obtained from Aldrich Chemicals
(Milwaukee, WI, USA), Packard (La Grange, IL, USA), ACROS
Organics, and PFALTZ and Bauer (Waterbury, CT, USA) at the
highest purity available.

PROTEOMICS

Phenanthrene-grown cells (200 ml, OD600 = 0.6) were ﬁltered
through glass wool and then recovered by centrifugation at
3,800× g for 5 min. The cells were washed twice with phosphate
buffer and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline. Pyruvate-
grown cells were prepared similarly, except for omission of the ﬁl-
tration step. “In Liquid” digestion and mass spectrometric analysis
was done at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Biotechnol-
ogy Center, Mass Spectrometry Facility. Cells were incubated on
ice (15 min) in 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid/acetone (10-fold
excess) and precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation
(10 min, 16,000× g ). The protein pellets were washed sequentially
with ice-cold acetone (2×), ice-cold methanol (1×), and then sol-
ubilized in 4 μl of 8 M urea in 100 mM NH4HCO3 (ABC). After a
10-min incubation, this denatured protein solution was diluted to
25 μl by addition of 1.25 μl 25 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μl acetonitrile
(ACN), 15.12 μl 25 mM ABC, 0.12 μl 1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), and
2.5 μl trypsin [100 ng/μl Trypsin Gold (Promega Corp.) in 25 mM
ABC]. Following a 12-h of trypsin digestion (37˚C) another 2 μl
of trypsin was added and a second digestion done for 2 h at 42˚C.
Digestion was terminated by addition of triﬂuoroacetic acid to a
ﬁnal concentration of 0.3% (w/v).

Peptides were analyzed by nanoLC–MS/MS using an Agilent
1100 nanoﬂow system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA)
connected to a hybrid linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer
(LTQ-Orbitrap XL, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, San Jose, CA, USA)
equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. Capillary HPLC was
done using an in-house fabricated column with integrated elec-
trospray emitter essentially as described by (Martin et al., 2000)
except that 360 μm× 75 μm fused silica tubing was used. The
column was packed with Jupiter 4 μm C12 particles (Phenomenex
Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) to ca. 12 cm. Sample loading (8 μl) and
desalting were achieved using a trapping column in line with the
autosampler (Zorbax 300SB-C18, 5 μm, 5 mm× 0.3 mm, Agilent

Technologies). During sample loading and desalting, an isocratic
mobile phase of 1% (v/v) ACN, 0.1% formic acid (w/v) was used,
and run at 10 μl/min. Peptides were then eluted by a gradient
(200 nl/min) of 0.1% (w/v) formic acid in water (Buffer A) and
95% (v/v) ACN, 0.1% (w/v) formic acid in water (Buffer B) with
increasing Buffer A from 0 to 40% (75 min), 40 to 60% (20 min),
and 60 to 100% (5 min). The LTQ-Orbitrap acquired MS/MS
spectra in data-dependent mode with MS survey scans (m/z 300–
2,000) collected in centroid mode at a resolving power of 100,000.
Spectra were collected on the ﬁve most-abundant signals in each
survey scan. Dynamic exclusion was used to increase dynamic
range and maximize peptide identiﬁcations, and excluded pre-
cursors between 0.55 m/z below and 1.05 m/z above previously
selected precursors; precursors remained on the exclusion list for
15 s. Singly charged ions and ions for which the charge state could

not be assigned were rejected from consideration for MS/MS.
Raw MS/MS data was searched against the non-redundant Delftia
sp. Cs1-4 amino acid sequence database (5,867 protein entries;
GenBank entry NC_015563) using an in-house Mascot search
engine allowing variable modiﬁcations (methionine oxidation;
glutamine, asparagine deamidation) a peptide mass tolerance of
15 ppm and 0.6 Da fragment mass.

Protein annotation and signiﬁcance of protein identiﬁcations
were done with Scaffold (version 3.00.07, Proteome Software Inc.,
Portland, OR, USA). Peptide identiﬁcations were accepted if iden-
tities of at least two unique, matching peptides were established
at ≥90.0% probability via the Peptide Prophet algorithm (Keller
et al., 2002). Protein identiﬁcation probabilities were assigned by
the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003). Pro-
teins that contained similar peptides and could not be differen-
tiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the
principles of parsimony.

DNA MANIPULATIONS, CLONING, AND SEQUENCE ANALYSIS
Standard procedures were used for DNA manipulations (Sam-
brook et al., 1989). Restriction enzymes were obtained from
Promega (Madison, WI, USA) or New England Biolabs (Beverly,
MA, USA). Genomic DNA was extracted using Wizard Genomic
DNA Puriﬁcation kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Primers
were synthesized by the UW–Madison Biotechnology Center. Ex
Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Madison, WI, USA) was used in
PCR ampliﬁcation reactions. DNA Fragments were puriﬁed from
agarose gels with QIAquick spin columns (QIAGEN, Valencia,
CA, USA) and sequenced at the Univ. Wisconsin Biotechnol-
ogy Center. GenBank ﬁles of all sequences used in this study
were imported into Geneious (v. 5.4.5; Biomatters Ltd., Auck-
land 1010, New Zealand) for manual curation, and alignment
by Clustal, MUSCLE, or MAUVE, as appropriate. Whole genome
sequences were uploaded to Islandviewer1 for identiﬁcation of
GEIs. Alignment ﬁgures were generated with Geneious v. 5.4.5
(http://www.geneious.com).

GENERATION OF ΔphnAcAd MUTANTS AND MUTANT
COMPLEMENTATION
Genes putatively encoding the phenanthrene dioxygenase large
and small subunits (phnAcAd), upstream (Cs1-4 genome positions
1959578–1960237) and downstream (strain Cs1-4 genome posi-
tions 1962038–1962817) fragments were ampliﬁed with primers
phnAcbglII/phnACKpnI and phnACsacII/phnAcsacI, respectively
(Table S2 in Supplementary Material). The amplicons were gel
puriﬁed and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (pSCH448 and pSCH449).
These fragments were sequentially assembled on the same sites
on pJK100 (pSCH453). Next, pSCH453 was introduced into E.
coli BW19851 (λ pir) then conjugated into strain Cs1-4 and
Tcs and Kmr transconjugants were selected (strain SCH455,
ΔphnAcAd:Km). Replacement of phnAcAd with the kanamycin
resistance gene was conﬁrmed by PCR using primers phndectF
and phndetcR.

For

complementation, a 2,064-bp fragment

containing
phnAcAd (strain Cs1-4 genome positions 1960120–1962184) was

1http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandviewer/

ampliﬁed with primers PhnAcNdeF1 and PhnAcSacIIR1 (Table
S2 in Supplementary Material) using strain Cs1-4 genomic DNA
as a template. The amplicon was then cloned into pGEM-
T easy (pSCH434). The insertion was released by SacII and
cloned into the site on pSCH442 and under the control of a
strong promoter (PnpdA) identiﬁed in strain Cs1-4 (Chen and
Hickey, 2011). A construct with the correct insertion (pSCH462,
PnpdA+ phenAcAd) was identiﬁed by sequencing multiple ran-
dom colonies, which was then introduced into the ΔphenAcAd:Km
mutant, yielding strain SCH471. The phenAcAd expression vector
pSCH453 was used in a similar manner to test for complementa-
tion of a Burkholderia sp. Ch1-1 ΔphnAcAd:Km mutant.

HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION
The pET5a expression system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was
used for gene expression in E. coli. Primers, phnF and phnR (Table
S2 in Supplementary Material) were used for cloning of the 5.3-kb
phn RHD (phnAb–Ad) cluster from genomic DNA of Burkholde-
ria sp. Ch1-1. The puriﬁed fragment was cloned into pGEM-T
Easy, yielding pTPHE2 and propagated in E. coli DH5α. The
Fragment inserted into pTPHE2 was released by digestion with
NdeI, and then puriﬁed and ligated into NdeI-digested pET5a
to give pPHE2. The orientation and sequence of phnAb–Ad in
pPHE2 was conﬁrmed by sequencing. Plasmids were introduced
by electroporation into E. coli strain BL21 AI strain for heterol-
ogous expression. Single colonies of E. coli BL21 AI (pPHE2)
and the negative control E. coli BL21 AI (pET5a) were inocu-
lated into separate tubes of LB (3 ml) and incubated overnight at
37˚C. Aliquots of each culture (2 ml) were then inoculated into

fresh LB (100 ml), incubated at 37˚C. Upon reaching OD600 = 0.6,

arabinose was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.2% (w/v) for
induction. Following overnight incubation at 25˚C, cells were col-
lected by centrifugation (3,800× g, 5 min) then washed with, and
resuspended in, M9 medium (43). For substrate speciﬁcity tests,
PAH were added from hexane stocks to a ﬁnal concentration of
100 μM. The cells were incubated at 25˚C, and the reaction was
stopped by addition of an equal volume of ethyl acetate. Analy-
sis of phenanthrene and phenanthrene metabolites was done in a
manner similar to that described by Kang et al. (2003).

RESULTS
STRUCTURE OF THE phn ISLAND
The Delftia sp. Cs1-4 genome consisted of a single, 6.8 Mb chro-
mosome. MAUVE Alignment of the strain Cs1-4 chromosome
with that of its closest relative with a complete genome sequence,
Delftia acidovorans SPH1, indicated that genes encoding the
entire pathway for phenanthrene catabolism were located within
a 232,325-bp region absent in D. acidovorans SPH1 (Figure 1A).
Analysis by GEI detection algorithms also identiﬁed this 232 kb
region as a GEI (Figure 1B), now termed the phn island. The 3
ter-
minus of the island was located in a non-coding region, upstream
of a gene putatively encoding an S ﬁmbrial protein. This terminus
was delimited by a 57-bp sequence, which also occurred nearby in
the chromosomal region as an inverted repeat (Figures 2A,B).

There were 10 clusters of genes related by encoding: (1) phenan-
threne catabolism to o-phthalate, (2) o-phthalate degradation
to protocatechuate, (3) protocatechuate catabolism to central

(5) a type IV secretory system, (6) a PRTRC system, (7) ele-
ment integration, and (8–10) hypothetical proteins. The island
also contained genes encoding quorum sensing signal molecules
(Figure 2A). Genes encoding phage-like mobilization functions
and prophage stabilization were distributed across the element,
and a 32-bp palindromic sequence was present at two locations
(Figures 2A,B). While the G+ C content of the phn island as a
whole was similar to that of the strain Cs1-4 chromosome (66.7%),
that of the region encoding the upper pathway for phenanthrene

degradation (phn cluster; Figure 2A) showed a marked divergence
at ca. 50% G+ C.

The cluster encoding phenanthrene catabolism to o-phthalate
encompassed 17 phn genes (phnAa to phnI ; Figures 3 and 4)
interspersed with genes for glutathione S-transferase, regula-
tory elements, transposons/integrases and hypothetical proteins.
Alignment of the phn clusters of strain Cs1-4 with those of A.
faecalis AFK2 and Burkholderia sp. Ch1-1 revealed general con-
servation of phnAb–phnD, the exception being strain Ch1-1 in
which a transposon was inserted between phnAb–Aa (Figure 4).

Further downstream, there were two regulatory genes: tetR was
present in strains Cs1-4 and Ch1-1, but fragmented in A. faecalis
AFK2, while a marR regulator was conserved between the clusters.
The gst gene was also conserved, as were phnH–G. But, the clus-
ters diverged at phnI, which was interrupted by a transposase in
strain Cs1-4. In strain Cs1-4, phnI was the last gene in the cluster
(Figure 4).

Four new genes (termed phnJKLM ) were identiﬁed (Figure 4),
which proteomics indicated were linked to phenanthrene degra-
dation (see below). The ﬁrst of these, phnJ, encoded a pro-
tein containing a signal peptide, and a conserved domain of
unknown function (DUF) 1302. The product of the follow-
ing gene, phnK, contained a signal peptide and DUF 1329. The
phnL product was a Ycf48-like protein, which in phototrophs,

functions in the assembly of Photosystem II (Komenda et al.,
2008; Rengstl et al., 2011). Lastly, phnM, encoded an RND-type
hydrophobe/amphiphile efﬂux protein. In the other phnAFK2 phy-
lotypes, phnJ was either truncated (A. faecalis AFK2) or frag-
mented (Burkholderia sp. Ch1-1). Further comparison of the
phnJKLM cluster could be done only with strain AFK2, which dif-
fered from strain Cs1-4 in that phnLM were fragmented and only
phnK was intact. GenBank searches revealed the phnJKLM cluster
was widely distributed across diverse alpha-, beta-, and gamma-
proteobacteria, the latter with representatives from terrestrial and
marine environments (Table 1). A common feature linking these
diverse organisms was the location of phnJKLM adjacent to genes
for oxidoreductases (Table 1).

In strain Cs1-4, the lower pathway of phenanthrene catab-
olism entails transformation of o-phthalate to protocatechuate
(PCA), and PCA degradation to oxaloacetate and pyruvate via
the meta pathway (Figure 3). The genes for o-phthalate and PCA
degradation (oph and pmd, respectively) occurred in separate clus-
ters (Figures 2A, 5, and 6). The organization of the oph cluster
(Figure 5) was generally similar to that of Comamonas testos-
teroni KF-1. However, a signiﬁcant difference between the oph
clusters of strain Cs1-4 and that of C. testosteroni KF-1 was the
presence in the strain Cs1-4 cluster of two non-identical copies
of ophA2 (Figure 5), which encodes the oxygenase component of
phthalate-4,5-dioxygenase (Batie et al., 1987).

The pmd cluster occurred in two loci, one located on the phn
island (Cluster 1; Figures 2A and 6) and the other outside of it
(Cluster 2; Figure 6). There was also a third locus in strain Cs1-4
where additional copies of pmdAB [protocatechuate 4,5 (meta)-
dioxygenase] were located, but were not associated with any other
PCA degradation genes (DelCs14_3008, 3009). The structure of
pmd Cluster 1 was similar to that of Ramlibacter tataouinensis
TTB310 while Cluster 2 organization was like that of other Coma-
monadaceae as exempliﬁed by Comamonas sp. DJ-12 (Figure 6).
The structures of the pmd clusters diverged in two ways (Figure 6).

First, Cluster 1 lacked pmdK/pmcT (putatively encoding an aro-
matic acid transporter) and instead had a gene for a predicted
LTTR-domain protein located in that position. Secondly, Cluster
1 encompassed a gene predicted to encode an NAD-binding dehy-
drogenase, the function of which in the meta pathway is unknown.
The latter gene was conserved in the pmd clusters of strains Cs1-
4 and TTB310, but the NAD-binding dehydrogenase was present
only in strain Cs1-4 (Figure 6).

(cid:3)
A cluster of genes near the 5

end of the island-encoded
enzymes were predicted to link biosynthesis of fatty acids with
that of the carbon storage polymers, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA;
Figure 2A). Key intermediates of fatty acid synthesis used in
production of medium chain length PHA are enoyl-CoA, 3-
ketoacyl-CoA, (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA and 3-hydroxyacyl-acyl-
carrier-protein (Witholt and Kessler, 1999). Enzymes linking
these to PHA synthesis are enoyl-CoA hydratase (Fiedler et al.,
2002; Tsuge et al., 2003), 3-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reduc-
tase (Ren et al., 2000), and epimerase (Madison and Huisman,
1999; Witholt and Kessler, 1999). Within the putative PHA clus-
ter, three genes (DelCs14_1623, 1625, 1627) were predicted to
encode MaoC-like proteins, which have been demonstrated as
important in PHA biosynthesis (Park and Lee, 2003). These
MaoC-like proteins were orthologs of the (R)-speciﬁc enoyl-
CoA hydratase, PhaJ1 (Park and Lee, 2003). The product of
DelCs14_1636 was a FabG ortholog, which is a 3-ketoacyl-
(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase. Epimerase activity could be pro-
vided by two genes predicted to encode MmgE/PrpD family
proteins (DelCs14_1624, DelCs14_1635) for which this func-
tion has recently been established (Lohkamp et al., 2006).
Other genes with potential
links to fatty acid biosynthesis
were (locus): enoyl-CoA reductase (a.k.a. butyrl-CoA dehydro-
genase; DelCs14_1626), acetyl-CoA synthetase (DelCs14_1645),
crotonase (DelCs14_1643), and NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidore-
ductases (DelCs14_1637) for the inter-conversion of aldehy-
des/ketones and alcohols.

Reactions catalyzed by oph gene products are summarized in Figure 3.

Another function of the PHA cluster may be to synthesize pan-
tothenate. This compound is essential for coenzyme-A (CoA),
which in turn is required for fatty acid metabolism, and thus
PHA biosynthesis as well. β-Alanine is required for pantothenate
production, and is produced primarily by aspartate decarboxyla-
tion (Williamson and Brown, 1979); the enzyme catalyzing this
reaction, l-aspartate decarboxylase, was the predicted product
of DelCs14_1648. Aspartate formation in turn proceeds from
oxaloacetic acid (OAA), a product of the phenanthrene lower
pathway. Levels of OAA (and acetyl-CoA) could also be modu-
lated by formyl-CoA transferase (DelCs14_1628), which catalyzes
the reversible transfer of CoA between acetyl-CoA and OAA,
and citryl-CoA lyase (DelCs14_1639, _1629), which transforms

citryl-CoA into acetyl-CoA and OAA. The PHA cluster contained
ﬁve proteins of a complete ABC transport system with similar-
ity to that for branched chain amino acids. The function of the
transporter is unknown, but the presence of a periplasmic binding
protein (DelCs14_1630) suggested substrate import.

The phn island contained 25 genes predicted to be involved
in some aspect of DNA mobilization (Table 2). Like other GEI,
it possessed a bacteriophage P4-like integrase located near the
site of insertion, which had the greatest similarity to an integrase
from Burkholderia phage BcepC6B (Table 3). While additional

close orthologs (≥60% homology; Bi et al., 2012) of IntCs14

were not identiﬁed, a number of low similarity hits were found
in betaproteobacterial genera of the Burkholderiales, including

the pathogens Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia thai-
landensis (Table 3). A feature common to most of these was
integrase localization adjacent to genes predicted to encode
RngG/CafA-orthologs (RNaseG; Table 3).

The type IV secretion system (T4SS) of the phn island was
similar to that of the F-plasmid in overall arrangement of the tra
functions, and possession of ﬁve tra genes speciﬁc to F-plasmid-
like T4SS (Lawley et al., 2003; Table 4). But, the phn island T4SS
lacked a number of the F-plasmid T4SS genes, and contained seven
hypothetical genes the F-plasmid lacks. One gene notably absent
from the phn island was traJ that, on the F-plasmid, controls T4SS
gene transcription (Frost et al., 1994). The phn island TraI protein
belonged to the PFL_4751 family of relaxases, which are required
for transfer of SXT/R391 elements, as well as ICE of Pseudomonas
ﬂuorescens Pf-5 (Flannery et al., 2011).

Genes encoding other types of DNA integration/excision func-
tions were dispersed throughout the island (Figure 2A; Table 2).
There were 10 transposases, and those of the IS4- and IS66-type
were closely associated with the phn cluster. Seven genes had
predicted functions that could have roles in GEI stabilization or
regulation of GEI excision. Potential regulators were a LexA-like
protein and FlhC ortholog (Flagellar transcriptional activator).
The LexA family includes bacterial prophage repressor proteins
involved in the SOS response (Beaber et al., 2004) while FlhC (ﬂa-
gellar transcriptional activator) orthologs can function in global
regulation of cellular processes. Both LexA and FlhC are part of a
regulatory loop that is activated as part of the SOS response, which
controls excision and transfer of SXT-type GEI (Beaber et al.,
2002; Burrus and Waldor, 2003). Proteins that encoded potential
toxin/antitoxin systems that could function in GEI stabilization
included (Table 2): a protein with a PIN (PilT N terminus) domain,
two Fic/Doc (Filamentation induced by cAMP/Death on curing)-
like proteins and the OLD protein/UvrD pair (Overcome lysogeny
defect/UV repair). The latter combination is commonly associ-
ated with putative GEI, and has been hypothesized to be either a
toxin–antitoxin system (RNase toxin linked with an antitoxin), or
a recombinase possibly involved in GEI integration (Khan et al,
2010). The phn island also contained all seven constituents of a
“PRTRC” system, which is cataloged in TFAM as “a genetic system
associated with mobile elements”2

Lastly, the lasI /luxR pair (Figure 2A) could direct the forma-
tion of N -acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) cell signaling molecules.
The role of AHL as global regulators of many cellular functions
is well established, and lasI /luxR orthologs have been identiﬁed
on GEI in Burkholderia cepacia (Baldwin et al., 2004). However, in
strain Cs1-4, deletion of lasI had no detectable effect on its growth
or degradation of phenantherene (Chen and Hickey, 2011); thus,
the function of a LasI-encoded AHL are unknown.

12 proteins of the phenantherene degradation upper pathway and
13 proteins of the lower pathway (Table 5). The relative abundance
of PhnF was the greatest of all phenanthrene degradation pathway
proteins detected, and ranked third overall in relative abundance
in the phenanthrene proteome (Table S3 in Supplementary Mate-
rial). In the pyruvate proteome, the same array of upper pathway
proteins were identiﬁed, but at lower abundances. In contrast, no
proteins of the lower pathway were detected in the pyruvate-grown
cells. Based on comparative abundance of peptide scans in pyru-
vate vs. phenanthrene-grown cells, all phenanthrene degradation

proteins detected exhibited induction during growth on phenan-
threne, except perhaps PhnG (Table 5). Peptides were detected
for all four of the new phenanthrene degradation genes described
above (phnJKLM ), and of these PhnJ ranked just behind PhnF in
terms of overall abundance (Table S3 in Supplementary Mater-
ial). Furthermore, all four proteins showed apparent induction by
growth on phenanthrene. In the lower pathway, peptides match-
ing both copies of OphA2 were identiﬁed, with those from locus
DelCs14_1655 more abundant. Likewise, peptides matching gene
products from both pmd clusters were detected, including both

GENETIC ANALYSES OF phnAa–d
The genes encoding the RHD large and small subunits, phnAcAd,
were deleted by allelic exchange in strain Cs1-4, and the resul-
tant ΔphnAcAd mutant was unable to grow on phenanthrene
(Figure 7A). Complementation in trans with phnAcAd restored
growth of the ΔphnAcAd mutant to levels similar to that of the
wild type (Figure 7A). The growth impairment imposed upon the
ΔphnAcAd mutant was speciﬁc to use of phenanthrene as a sole
carbon source, as the mutant’s growth on pyruvate was indistin-
guishable from that of the wild type or complemented mutant
(Figure 7B). The phnAa–d cluster was cloned from Burkholde-
ria sp. Ch1-1, and expressed in E. coli; phnAa–d from Ch1-1 to
determine if interruption by a transposon (see above) affected the
ability of the cluster to produce a functional enzyme. Heterol-
ogous expression was successful, and E. coli harboring phnAa–d
transformed all PAH tested (Figure 7C). No transformation was
detected by the control E. coli BL21 (AI)(pET5a). Naphthalene

pounds were not detectable by HPLC after 1 h of incubation. For
the remaining PAH tested, the apparent preference of the RHD
decreased in the order of phenanthrene > anthracene > pyrene
(Figure 7C). Notably, the RHD transformed ca. 50% of pyrene
to pyrene dihydrodiols.

DISCUSSION
The phn island represented a type of GEI that, to the best of our
knowledge, has not been previously reported. Classes of GEI are

www.frontiersin.org

April 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 125 | 11

Hickey et al.

The phn island

deﬁned by having an integrase homology of ≥60%, signiﬁcant
structural synteny and a common site of chromosomal integra-
tion (Bi et al., 2012). For the phn island, the only protein reaching
the 60% homology threshold with IntCs14 was the integrase of the
podophage BcepC68, an element with no additional similarities to
the phn island. Thus, other GEI of the phn island class have not
yet been revealed by genome sequencing projects.

The preferred site(s) of integration for phn island-like ele-
ments cannot be conclusively identiﬁed without orthologs of
IntCs14 for comparison. But, one of the most common targets
for GEI, tRNA genes, can probably be ruled out as the nearest such
gene was ca. 60 kb downstream of the phn island. Integration of
GEI at sites besides tRNA loci is most extensively studied with
the SXT/R391-type elements, which target prfC (Peptide Chain
Release Factor 3; Burrus and Waldor, 2003). Because tRNA genes
and prfC encode essential functions, they are widely conserved
and sequences embedded in these can serve as effective targets
(attB sites) for homologous regions (attP site) in an ICE (Tole-
man and Walsh, 2011). It is unclear whether the ﬁmbrial protein
(cid:3)
gene present in the chromosome at the 3
end of the phn island had
the broad conservation typical of ICE integration loci. However,
(cid:3)
the 57-bp sequence located in the 3
terminus of the phn island
and repeated in the adjacent chromosomal region strongly resem-
bled an attP–attB pair, but was far larger than any such sequence
recognition site yet reported. Further study is needed to elucidate
the potential function of that 57-bp motif.

Processes governing GEI mobilization are key components of
their biology and, while these are currently undetermined for
the phn island, that element possessed genes known to mediate
mobilization of SXT/R391-type GEI. Conjugal transfer of the SXT
element occurs via a T4SS, and TraD (T4SS conjugal coupling
factor) of the phn island was a protein of the SXT/TOL subfamily.
Also, both the phn island and the SXT element possessed orthologs
of FlhC and the lambda CI repressor (SetC and SetR, respectively
in the SXT element), which are key (along with FlhD) in reg-
ulating SXT element’s excision and circularization (Burrus and
Waldor, 2003). The phn island and SXT element differed in that
the latter has an ﬂhD ortholog (setD) adjoining setC, whereas the
phn island did not. But, there was a second locus in strain Cs1-4
(DelCs14_4452, _4453) that could supply FlhD. With the SXT ele-
ment, these regulatory proteins are part of a system that triggers
its excision in response to DNA damage, which can result from
exposure to UV light or reactive oxygen species (ROS). A simi-
lar system could operate with the phn island and ROS exposure
might be particularly important, as ROS would be generated via
activity of oxygenases the island encodes for phenanthrene catab-
olism, and/or catecholic metabolites that are produced during that
process (Elstner, 1982; Dalton et al., 1999; Schweigert et al., 2001).
Genomic islands are emerging as key elements shaping the
biodegradative capacity of bacterial communities. Other GEI that
carry biodegradation functions are the (substrates degraded):
100 kb clc element (chlorocatechols, aminophenols; Gaillard et al.,
2006), 90 kb bph–sal element (biphenyl; Nishi et al., 2000), 55 kb
biphenyl catabolic transposon Tn4371 (biphenyl; Toussaint et al.,
2003), 100 kb Tn3-like Alteromonas sp. SN2 transposon (naph-
thalene; Jin et al., 2011) and an unclassiﬁed GEI in P. naph-
thalenivorans CJ2 (naphthalene; Yagi et al., 2009). In terms of

catabolic activity, all of these GEI (except for the clc element)
were similar to the phn island in encoding both the “upper”
and “lower” pathways for catabolism of a polyaromatic com-
pound. However, the ca. 235 kb phn island was distinct from all
of the above in encoding additional functions such as a potential
link of catabolism to PHA/fatty acid biosynthesis, production of
AHL signaling molecules and >50 hypothetical proteins. Thus,
phn island-encoded functions likely extended to cellular processes
beyond biodegradation. The phn island was also distinguished
from other biodegradation GEI as it was the only element of this
group with apparent similarity in its mobilization biology to that
of SXT/R391-type GEI.

The present study provided the ﬁrst insight into a potential
mechanism of HGT for the phnAFK2 genotype. “Curing” experi-
ments with A. faecalis AFK2 indicated possible association of the
phenanthrene degradation phenotype with a ca. 43 kb plasmid
(Kiyohara et al., 1990). But, which, if any, of the phn, oph, or pmd
genes were carried by that plasmid was not reported. The diver-
gence in G+ C content of the phn cluster (ca. 50%) indicated a
phylogenetic origin distinct from any host of the phn genes that
is currently known. As noted above, the G+ C content for Delf-
tia sp. Cs1-4 was 66.7%, while that of A. faecalis AFK2 was 68%
(Kiyohara et al., 1982) and 62.5% for Burkholderia sp. Ch1-13.
The G+ C content for Acidovorax sp. NA3 has not been reported,
but in other Acidovorax genomes, it ranged from 64.9 to 66.8%
(see text footnote 3). Thus, the phn cluster constituted a module
mobilized independently of the phn island. Mechanisms for HGT
of the phn cluster are unknown, but the bracketing by IS4- and
IS66-type transposons may have implicated participation in HGT
by those elements. Finally, although the phylogenetic origin of the
phn cluster cannot be unequivocally determined, a betaproteobac-
terial source would be consistent with that of other phn island
components (e.g., T4SS cluster, PRTRC cluster, etc.). Also, while
the 50% G+ C content of the phn cluster was divergent from the
genomic G+ C content of its known hosts, which were all of the
order Burkholderiales, it would be in line with the median genomic
G+ C content for the betaproteobacteria as a whole (Lightﬁeld
et al., 2011).

Six other GEI were identiﬁed by BLAST searches that had
a T4SS cluster with high homology to that of the phn island;
three of these also contained a PRTRC region like that of the
phn island. All of these GEI were located in betaproteobacteria of
the Comamonadaceae (Acidovorax sp. JS42) or Rhodocyclaceae
(Alicycliphilus denitriﬁcans K601, Dechloromonas aromatica RCB),
although none could be classed with the phn island because of

low integrase homology with IntCs14 (≤23%). But, the GEI from

strains JS42 and K601 were of the same class based on high inte-
grase homology (96%), a common site of insertion (tRNAAla), and
overall synteny.

Two signiﬁcant ﬁndings regarding the phn cluster in strain Cs1-
4 were the relocation of phnI, and the identiﬁcation of four new
genes, phnJKLM. The latter were not annotated in the GenBank
record for strain AFK2, but were readily identiﬁed by ORF analysis
of that sequence, and it is alignment with the phn region of strain

The phn island

Cs1-4. The degeneration of phnJLM in strain AFK2 suggested
these genes were part of an ancestral phn module common to
strains AFK2 and Cs1-4, but not utilized in the former. In con-
trast, while speciﬁc functions of phnJKLM in strain Cs1-4 were
unknown, all exhibited apparent induction by growth on phenan-
threne, suggesting some role in the utilization of that compound.
Furthermore, since phnJKLM orthologs were associated with oxi-
doreductases for metabolism of a variety of hydrocarbons, their
functions may be broadly applicable in hydrocarbon degradation,
rather than speciﬁc to degradation of phenanthrene, or even PAH
in general.

Segregation of phnI from the main body of the phn cluster
could potentially have signiﬁcant regulatory and metabolic impli-
cations. Singleton et al. (2009) demonstrated that in Acidovorax
sp. AN3 phnAc, phnB, and phnC were co-transcribed and, since
phnI was upstream of phnC, it too would be included in that
transcript. But, in strain Cs1-4, such co-transcription of phnI is
uncertain as ca. 8 kb and ﬁve genes separate it from the body of the
phn cluster. In this case, phnI expression may be under separate
transcriptional control, which could potentially affect the cata-
bolic pathway. PhnI catalyzes the last step of the upper pathway
(2-carboxybenzaldehyde conversion to o-phthalate), and a notable
difference between strains Cs1-4 and Ch1-1 (in which phnI was
included within the phn cluster) was that the former accumu-
lated o-phthalate during growth on phenanthrene while the latter
did not (Shetty, 2011). In strain Cs1-4, o-phthalate accumulation
could reﬂect dis-synchronization of PhnI activity with that of the
upstream enzymes in the phn catabolic pathway.

Growth on phenanthrene is known to induce phn expression
(Singleton et al., 2009), but regulatory mechanisms controlling
transcription of the phn genes are unknown. Conservation of the
marR-like element within the phn cluster may have indicated it
served a regulatory function in phenanthrene degradation that is
common to all of the phn genotype bacteria. The marR elements
are generally responsive to aromatic compounds in general (Alek-
shun and Levy, 1999), and in P. naphthalenivorans CJ2, regulates
expression of naphthalene degradation genes (Jeon et al., 2006).
Also, marR genes can be up-regulated by exposure to naphthenic
acids (Zhang et al., 2011), chemicals that have some resemblance to
metabolites produced during phenanthrene metabolism. Thus, a
possible role for marR is regulation of the phn genes via interaction
with one or more phenanthrene metabolites.

The oph and pmd clusters each presented interesting types of
apparent redundancy. The multiple pmd clusters were similar to
that in other bacteria, such as the multiple phenol degradation
clusters (mhp genes) in Dechloromonas aromatica (Salinero et al.,
2009). The physiological signiﬁcance of such redundancy is as yet
unknown. But, for Delftia sp. Cs1-4, proteomics data presented
here proved both pmd paralogs were expressed, and apparently
induced by growth on phenanthrene. A search of all currently
available genomes possessing genes annotated as “phthalate 4,5-
dioxygenase” yielded no other examples of an oph operon with
two copies of ophA2. Two nearly adjacent copies of phthalate
4,5-dioxygenase oxygenase were located in the actinobacterium
Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190 (Psed_3921, Psed_3923;
NC_015312.1), but these were not associated with any other oph
genes. Thus, the structure of the oph cluster in strain Cs1-4 is likely

the ﬁst example of its kind. Phthalate dioxygenase is composed of a
reductase, OphA1, and a single alpha subunit, OphA2 (Batie et al.,
1987; Kweon et al., 2008), and thus the roles of two non-identical
copies of OphA2 is unknown. Proteomics data established expres-
sion of both copies, but the within-cluster copy (DelCs14_1655)
appeared more abundant from spectral scans. We speculate that
the second copy of OphA2 may be optimized for a substrate other
than o-phthalate.

Heterologous expression and targeted mutagenesis established
phnAa–d as encoding the RHD responsible for initiating metab-
olism of phenanthrene. As yet, evidence for this activity has been
indirect, such as monitoring transcript production (Singleton
et al., 2009). Heterologous expression demonstrated that, like other
PAH RHD, the phnAa–d enzyme transformed a number of PAH
including a four-ring compound, pyrene. However, a notable dif-
ference between the phn RHD and the nah-like RHD was that
organisms possessing the latter typically grow on many of the PAH
that are substrates for the nah RHD. But, phenanthrene is the only
PAH that supports growth of all currently cultured bacteria with
the phnAFK2 genotype (Acidovorax sp. NA3, Delftia sp. Cs1-4, and
Burkholderia sp. Ch1-1).

In conclusion, the present analyses of the phn island have added
new dimensions to our knowledge of PAH biodegradation, mech-
anisms of HGT that shape microbial communities and the nature
of GEI in general. This study has provided starting points for inves-
tigations into new biodegradative functions, such as the roles of
PhnJKLM or the two copies of OphA2, as well as identiﬁcation
of molecular mechanisms mediating phn island mobilization. The
acquisition of complete genome sequences for additional bacte-
ria of the phnAFK2 genotype and/or possessing close orthologs of
IntCs14 would greatly facilitate future studies on the structure and
function of phn island-type GEI.
