Abstract:  Klebsiella  pneumoniae  liver  abscess  syndrome  (KLAS)  is  an  emerging  invasive  infection  caused  by  highly 
virulent  community-acquired  strains  of  K.  pneumoniae  displaying  hypermucoviscosity.  The  salient  features  of  this  
syndrome  include  the  presence  of  bacteremia,  primary  monomicrobial  liver  abscess,  and  metastatic  complications.  A  
previously healthy Argentinean man presented with fever and found to have liver abscess caused by K. pneumoniae with 
metastatic seeding of gastric wall. Cultures from blood and liver abscess grew hypermucoviscous K1 K. pneumoniae with 
sequence  type  (ST)  23  by  multilocus  sequence  typing  (MLST),  positive  for  rmpA  (regulator  of  mucoid  phenotype  A), 
wzyKpK1  (capsular  polymerase)  and  aerobactin  genes.  The  hypermucoviscous  phenotype  of  this  K.  pneumoniae  isolate  
was readily identified by the "string test" (colonies formed a long string when touched with a loop). The patient responded 
favourably to percutaneous drainage of the abscess and antibiotics. This is the first documented report of KLAS described 
in Argentina, and may signal the emergence of this syndrome in South America.

INTRODUCTION 

  Highly  invasive  community-acquired  strains  of  K.  pneu-
moniae  with  a  particular  hypermucoviscous  phenotype  have 
been  reported  as  a  cause  of  a  distinctive  syndrome  of  com-
munity-acquired  cryptogenic  monomicrobial  liver  abscess 
with bacteremia, particularly in Taiwan where this disease is 
endemic  [1-10].  Although  it  is  still  most  frequent  in  Asia 
where  more  than  900  cases  have  been  reported,  scattered 
cases  are progressively being reported outside of this region 
[11]. More than one-half of patients with KLAS have diabe-
tes  mellitus,  whereas  the  remainder  are  otherwise  healthy 
individuals  [5,  12,  13].  Septic  metastatic  complications  are 
frequent [8, 10, 14, 15]. 

  Hypermucoviscous  strains  of  K.  pneumoniae  grow  in 
sticky  colonies  on  agar  plates  and  can  be  identified  by  a 
"string test" Fig. (1) [3, 10, 14]. 

  Most  of  the  isolates  from  patients  with  KLAS  belong  
to  the  K1  and  to  lesser  extent  K2  serotypes,  which  are

considered  to  be  the  most  virulent  strains  of  K.  pneumoniae 
[10,  16-20].  MagA  (mucoviscosity-associated  gene  A)  is  
a  chromosomal  gene  (recently  renamed  wzyKpK1)  that  is  
required  for  exopolysaccharide  web  biosynthesis.  This  
gene,  located  in  the  cps  (capsular  polysaccharide  synthesis) 
operon,  is  specific  of  K1  serotype  [11,  12,  21],  thus  is  a  
well-accepted  target  for  the  detection  of  K1  serotype  [18]. 
MagA-positive  (or  serotype  K1)  K.  pneumoniae  is  accord-
ingly  recognized  as  the  main  pathogen  of  pyogenic  liver  
abscess [15]. 

  The  plasmid  gene rmpA  (regulator  of  mucoid  phenotype 
A)  has  been  shown  to  be  a  transcriptional  activator  of  the 
wzyKpK1  cps  loci,  thus  enhancing  extracapsular  polysaccha-
ride synthesis in K. pneumoniae [11]. The hypermucoviscous 
phenotype results from overproduction of extracellular poly-
saccharides, which is  encoded by the chromosome and posi-
tively controlled by rmpA gene located on a plasmid [15]. 

  Most  isolates  of  serotype  K1  K.  pneumoniae  from  pa-
tients with KLAS in Asia belong to ST23. 

  The  following  case  illustrates  the  salient  features  of 
KLAS  and  demonstrates  the  global  spread  of  this  infectious 
disease into South America.

  Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with double 
contrast  showed  a  15  cm  hypodense  lesion  with  internal 
septa  in  the  liver  Fig.  (2a),  and  a  hypodense  tumour-like  
lesion  with  narrowing  of  the  gastric  lumen  Fig.  (2b).  The 
latter  was  further  investigated  by  endoscopy-ultrasound 
(EUS),  which  showed  a 3-cm  well-circumscribed hypoechoic 
submucosal  mass  suggestive  of  intramural  gastric  abscess 
Fig. (3a,b).  Chest x-ray, transthoracic echocardiography and 
abdominal  Doppler  ultrasound  were  normal.  Blood  cultures 
were taken. 

  A presumptive diagnosis of liver  abscess was made. The 
patient  was  started  on  ceftriaxone  plus  metronidazole  
empirically.  Sonography-guided  percutanous  drainage  was 
placed  yielding  60  ml  of  purulent  fluid  whose  Gram  stains 
showed  gram-negative  bacilli.  Histological  examination  dis-
closed  inflammatory  cells  and  was  negative  for  malignancy. 
Blood  and  abscess  aerobic  cultures  yielded  a  gram-negative 
lactose-fermenting  bacillus  identified  as  Klebsiella  pneumo-
niae,  whose  colonies  were  particularly  sticky.  Hypermu-
coviscous  phenotype  was  confirmed  by  a  positive  string  
test:  formation  of  viscous  strings  (cid:1)  5  mm  in  length  when  a 
standard bacteriologic loop was used to stretch the colony on 
agar  plate  Fig.  (1).  Antibiotic  susceptibility  testing  was  per-
formed  by  Etest  according  to  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Stan-
dards Institute guidelines. The strains were only intrinsically 
resistant to ampicillin. 

  Metronidazole  was  discontinued.  Two  weeks  after  ad-
mission  the  patient  became  afebrile  and  drainage  was  re-
moved. The gastric lesion markedly decreased in size during 
hospitalization.  He  was  discharged  on  oral  ciprofloxacin  to 
complete  a  6-week  course.  A  follow-up  CT  after  antibiotic 
therapy  was  completed  showed  resolution  of  the  abscesses. 
Patient turned to his usual state of health. 

Materials and Methodology  

 
Four isolates of K. pneumoniae from the patient (2 strains 
from liver abscess and 2 strains from blood) were sent to the 

 

Fig. (1). String test  result for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Stretching of 
K. pneumoniae colonies isolated from our patient’s sample resulted 
in  the  formation  of  a  string  >5  mm  in  length,  demonstrating  the 
hypermucoviscosity phenotype. 
 

CASE REPORT 

  A 55-year-old previously healthy man was admitted with 
12 days history of fever and fatigue. He was white, native of 
Argentina,  and  denied  recent  foreign  travel,  alcohol  or  drug 
abuse. He had no significant medical history. He had neither 
vomiting,  nor  abdominal  spontaneous  pain.  Clinical  exami-
nation  showed  temperature  of  40°C  and  tenderness  to  per-
cussion  over  the  right  upper  quadrant  of  the  abdomen.  The 
remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. 

tests  were  remarkable  for 

leukocytosis  
  Laboratory 
(41  900  cells/mm3),  erythrosedimentation  rate  73  mm/hour, 
C  reactive  protein  372  mg/L,  and  moderate  elevation  of  
alkaline  phosphatase  and  g-glutamyl  transpeptidase.  HIV 
serology  was  negative.  Fasting  plasma  glucose  levels  were 
normal.

Isolates  were  serotyped  using  capsule  swelling  reaction 
with antisera obtained from Health Protection Agency in UK 
and by PCR as previously described Table 1. In addition, one 
tube  multiplex  PCR  for  K1,  K2  and  K5  were  performed  ac-
cording to previously published method [18]. 

 
Since  magA,  rmpA  and  aerobactin  are  virulent  genes 
associated with KLAS, PCR was used to  target these genes. 
An  overnight-cultured  bacterial  colony  was  added  to  300 μl 
water and boiled for 15 min to release DNA template. Previ-
ously published primers used for PCR were listed in Table 1. 

The  reaction  mixture  was  kept  at  95°C  for  5  min,  followed 
by 40 temperature cycles of 95°C for1 min, 50°C for 1 min, 
and 72°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 7 min [11, 14].  

  MLST  was  performed  according  to  Turton  et  al.  [9],  to 
characterize the genotype of the isolates, by determining the 
nucleotide  sequences  of  seven  housekeeping  genes  (gapA, 
infB,  mdh,  pgi,  phoE,  rpoB,  and  tonB).  Sequences  of  these 
housekeeping  genes  were  obtained  for  isolates  from  liver 
abscess  patients  and  carriers.  Sequences  information  was 
compared  with  those  MLST  web  site  (http://pubmlst.org/ 
kpneumoniae/)  developed  by  Keith  Jolley.  Alleles  and  STs 
were  assigned  accordingly.  Sequences  of  any  alleles  that 
were  not  on  the  database  were  submitted  to  the  curator  and

obtained  for  the  allele  number.  Difference  in  two  or  more 
alleles was considered to be unrelated. 

  Bacterial  DNA  was  prepared  and  subjected  to  PFGE  as 
previously described [9]. The restriction enzyme XbaI (New 
England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) was used at the manu-
facturer’s suggested temperature. Restriction fragments were 
separated  by  PFGE  in  1%  agarose  gel  (Bio-Rad,  Hercules, 
CA,  USA)  in  0.5(cid:1)TBE  buffer  (45  mmol/L  Tris,  45  mmol/L 
boric acid, 1.0 mmol/L EDTA, pH8.0) for 22 h at 200 V at a 
temperature  of  14oC,  with  ramped  times  of  2  to  40  s  using 
the  Bio-Rad CHEF  MAPPER  apparatus (Bio-Rad Laborato-
ries,  Richmond,  CA,  USA).  Gels  were  then  stained  with 
ethidium  bromide  and  photographed  under  ultraviolet  light. 
The resulting genomic DNA profiles, or “fingerprints”, were 
interpreted according to established guidelines [22]. 

  Virulence  was  determined  by  mouse  inoculation:  ten 
mice  were  used  as  a  sample  population  for  each  bacterial 
concentration.  Since  all  isolates  were  identical,  one  isolate 
was selected for lethal dose causing 50% death (LD50). A 10-
fold serial dilution of CFU of  K. pneumoniae was made and 
BALB/c  mice  were  injected  intraperitonially  with  0.1  ml  of 
each  concentration.  Symptoms  and  signs  of  infection  were 
observed  for  14  days.  Survival  of  the  inoculated  mice  was 
recorded and  the LD50 was calculated using SigmaPlot ver-
sion 7.0 from SPSS Inc. (Chicago, IL). 

Results 

  The  results  obtained  were  as  follows.  All  strains  from 
different  isolation  sites  were  serotype  K1  by  PCR  and  had 
identical  profile  by  PFGE  Fig.  (4).  All  strains  were  positive 
for rmpA, wzyKpK1 and aerobactin genes as revealed by PCR 
using specific primers Fig. (5), Fig. (6). By using MLST, all

DISCUSSION 

  KLAS  is  a  community-acquired tissue  invasive infection 
endemic in Taiwan, where its incidence has increased in the 
past 20 years [15]. The syndrome seems to be spreading into 
other  geografic  areas,  as  sporadic  cases  have  been  reported 
in North America and Europe [3, 9, 12, 16, 23, 24]. 

 
It  is  remarkable  that  most  of  the  cases  of  KLAS  outside 
Asia  have  involved  patients  of  Asian  ethnicity  including 
Filipinos [1, 8, 24-26]; the reasons for this are not known [2, 
23]. Our patient was white. 

  Although  half  of  the  cases  occur  in  otherwise  healthy 
people  with  no  underlying  hepatobiliary  problems,  diabetic 
patients  are  more  susceptible  to  K.  pneumoniae  infection 
because  poor  glycemic  control  plays  an  important  role  in

phagocytic  resistance  against  K.  pneumoniae  [1,  5,  6,  8,  12, 
26-29]. 

 
Patients  often  complain  of  vague  constitutional  symp-
toms,  such  as  fever  and  fatigue.  Only  one-half  of  patients 
present with more specific clinical clues as right upper quad-
rant abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatomegaly [1, 24]. Our 
patient  only  exhibited  signs  of  fever,  and  had  no  abdominal 
complaints.  The  development  of  metastatic  infection,  a  rare 
infectious  complication  of  gram-negative  bacteremia  affects 
10 – 13% of patients with KLAS [1, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 30, 31]. 
Indeed,  if  defervescence  is  delayed,  a  gallium  scan  is  rec-
ommended to detect the presence of metastatic infection [1]. 

  Our  patient  presented  a  unique  septic  metastatic  compli-
cation. Although many distant suppurative lesions have been 
described, [15, 29] abscess of the gastric wall has never been 
described  as  a  metastatic  complication  of  KLAS  Fig.  (2), 
Fig. (3). 

  Treatment, including pigtail catheter drainage and antim-
icrobial  therapy  for  2–8  weeks,  is  highly  effective  [1,  24]. 
Due  to  the  presence  of  chromosomally  mediated  SHV-1  ß-
lactamase,  which  inactivates  cefazolin  in  an  inoculum-
dependent  manner,  ceftriaxone was prescribed in our patient 
rather  than  cefazolin.  It  has  been  shown  that  extended-
spectrum  cephalosporin,  instead  of  cefazolin  optimizes  the 
outcome of KLAS [8]. 

  Multiple  virulence  characteristics  are  responsible  for  the 
invasiveness  of  hypermucoviscous  K.  pneumoniae  strains. 
The conspicuous difference between K. pneumoniae and the 
other enterobacteria is the presence of a thick polysaccharide 
capsule,  which  helps  the  bacterium  avoid  phagocytosis,  be-
ing its principal virulence factor [10, 11, 21, 32]. According 
to the capsular polysaccharide, K. pneumoniae can be classi-
fied  into  77  serological  K  antigen  types,  distributed  across 
different geographical areas. K1 is the predominant serotype 
that causes KLAS in Asia [5, 6, 33-35]. 

  Hypermucoviscous  phenotypes  are  encapsulated  strains 
of K. pneumoniae (mostly K1 and to a lesser extent K2) that 
produce  vasts  amounts  of  extracapsular  polysaccharide  con-
stituting  a  mucoviscous  web  that  protects  these  strains  from 
phagocytosis by neutrophils and from serum killing by com-
plement  [24,  30,  36].  Hypermucoviscous  isolates  demon-
strate increased virulence in mice [4, 10], and grow in sticky 
colonies  that  form  long  (>5  mm)  mucous  strings  when 
touched  with  a  bacteriological  loop  (string  test)  [9,  10,  37, 
38]  (Fig.  (1)).  This  test  provides  an  easy,  rapid  diagnostic 
tool and was prominently seen for the K pneumoniae isolated 
from our patient [8, 39]. 

  The biochemical nature of the mucoid phenotype may be 
unrelated  to  capsular  polysaccharide  but  rather  related  to 
extracapsular  polysaccharide  [10].  A  number  of  chromoso-
mal  and  plasmid  genes  have  been  proposed  or  suggested  to 
play  key  roles  generation  of  the  hypermucoviscous  pheno-
type [23]. Chromosomal magA gene, which encodes a struc-
tural  outer  membrane  protein  essential  for  the  production  of 
the  exopolysaccharide  web,  is  associated  with  hypermu-
coviscous  phenotype  [14].  Further  sequencing  of  magA 
flanking  region  revealed  that  magA  was  the  serotype  K1  
allele  of  the  polymerase  wzy  loci  in  the  cps  operon  (i.e.,  
serotype  K1  polymerase  gene)  [6,  11,  12,  16,  32,  40,  41]. 

Although  the  wzy  gene  has  been  proposed  to  encode  an  O-
polysaccharide  polymerase  that  recognizes  and  extends  the 
O-antigen  polysaccharide-repeating  units  in  the  capsular 
synthesis process [42], recent investigations have shown it is 
responsible  for  K-  but  not  O-antigen  polymerization  [12]. 
The  cps  gene  clusters  of  serotypes  K1,  K2,  K5,  K20,  K54, 
and  K57  have  different  alleles  at  both wzy  and  wzx  loci  [6]. 
With the confirmation that magA was  a K1-antigen–specific 
polymerase, and in accordance with the bacterial polysaccha-
ride  gene  nomenclature  scheme,  it  has  been  proposed  that 
magA  has  to  be  renamed  wzyKpK1,  the  capsular  polymerase 
specific to K. pneumoniae serotype K1 [12]. So  wzyKpK1 is  a 
chromosomal  gene  located  in  the  cps  gene  cluster  for  sero-
type  K1  capsular  formation,  therefore  it  is  restricted  to  and 
present  in  all  of  the  isolates  of  this  serotype,  regardless  of 
virulence  [11,  12,  43,  44].  Although  the  deletion  mutant  of 
the wzy gene decreases mucoviscosity [42], this gene should 
be  considered  a  component  of  K1  capsule  formation  rather 
than  an  independent  specific  virulence  gene  for K.  pneumo-
niae strains causing liver abscess [16, 44]. 

  Two  plasmid  encoded  virulence  genes,  rmpA  and  aero-
bactin,  are  significant  correlated  with  the  high  virulence  of 
the  invasive  strains  [17,  36,  45,  46].  RmpA  gene  was  first 
described  by  Nassif  et  al.  in  1989  [47].  Yu  et  al.  demon-
strated  that  rmpA-carrying  strains  were  associated  with  the 
hypermucoviscous  phenotype,  as  well  as  with  the  invasive 
clinical  syndrome  [26,  32,  48].  RmpA  gene  is  a  transcrip-
tional  activator  of  the  cps  genes  and  functions  as  a  positive 
regulator  of  extracapsular  polysaccharide  synthesis  [49]. 
Mostover,  mutation  in  rmpA  lowers  in  13%–29%  capsule 
production [11]. 

  Overproduction  of  extracellular  polysaccharide  is  en-
coded by the chromosome and positively controlled by rmpA 
located on a plasmid. 

  The growth of bacteria  in host tissues is limited not only 
by  host  defense  mechanisms  but  also  by  its  supply  of  avail-
able  iron.  Many  bacteria  attempt  to  secure  their  supply  of 
iron  in  the  host  by  secreting  high  affinity  iron  chelators 
called siderophores, like aerobactin. Aerobactin can increase 
virulence  in  mouse  lethality  tests  by  100-fold  [46,  50].  The 
aerobactin and rmpA genes have been identified to be simul-
taneously  located  on  a  180-kilobase  plasmid  [10,  17],  thus, 
the presence of rmpA gene and phenotypic evidence of aero-
bactin production are closely correlated [10]. 

  The K. pneumoniae  isolate of our patient was  a K1 sero-
type  with  hypermucoviscous  phenotype  carrying  rmpA, 
aerobactin and wzyKpK1 genes. It is noteworthy that K1 sero-
type is infrequent in clinical isolates from Western countries 
[33]. 

  Although  K  serotyping  has  been  the  dominant  common 
language for recognition of related K. pneumoniae strains  in 
epidemiological  and  virulence  studies,  demonstration  of 
clonal dissemination requires genotypic studies. Comparison 
of isolates by PFGE has several limitations, including differ-
ent  definitions  of  clonality  from  different  laboratories. 
MLST  is  a  nucleotide  sequence–based  typing  method  that 
successfully  catalogs  bacterial  pathogens,  with  complete 
reproducibility  among  laboratories,  overcoming  the  limita-
tions  of  band-based  typing  methods  [34,  51].  Isolates  with 

112    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 

the same K  type  may belong  to unrelated STs. Indeed, most 
K-types  belong  to  unrelated  STs,  and  the  shared  K  type  re-
sults from horizontal transfer of the cps operon among unre-
lated  genotypes.  Therefore,  knowledge  of  the  K  type  pro-
vides unreliable prediction of clone identity [21]. 

 
It  has  been  shown  that  K1  serotype  K.  pneumoniae 
strains  responsible  for  endemic  KLAS  in  Asia,  are  geneti-
cally  homogeneous,  and  belong  to  ST23  [34],  which  have 
been  shown  to  be  more  virulent  in  animal  lethality  studies 
than  other  STs.  (L.  K.  Siu,  personal  communication).  Our 
isolation belonged to ST23, suggesting its global dissemina-
tion. 

  All ST23  clinical strains reported  are susceptible to  anti-
biotics  commonly  used  for  Klebsiella  infections  [51].  This 
pattern  of  susceptibility  has  remained  unchanged.  Virulence 
and  resistance  are  not  independent  properties;  furthermore, 
genes and environment interact to determine the fitness costs 
of  resistance.  The  relationship  between  virulence  and  resis-
tance  may play  an important role  in the pathogenesis of this 
invasive infection. It is plausible that the acquisition of resis-
tance may affect the virulence of the bacteria [1, 14]. 

  This  represents  the  first  reported  case  of  hypermucovis-
cous  serotype  K1  K.  pneumoniae  associated  with  liver  ab-
scess and bacteremia in Argentina. These strains can be read-
ily detected by the string test (Fig. (1)). MLST and molecular 
characterization  of  hypermucoviscous  phenotype  associated 
genes  is  straightforward.  Further  geographic  dissemination 
of  hypermucoviscous  K1  K.  pneumoniae  strains  of  ST23  is 
likely.  Increased  awareness  about  KLAS  by  physicians  and 
public  health  officials  in  South  America  and  worldwide 
could  allow  earlier  detection  and  optimal  treatment  of  
patients  [26].  A  rising  number  of  cases  from  other  
geographic  regions  indicate  that  this  is  a  globally  emerging 
infectious disease.
