Abstract:  Yeasts  isolated  from  a  freshly  tapped  palm  wine  obtained  from  Akure,  Nigeria  were  identified  as  Schizosac-
charomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Debaryomyces hansenii, Geotrichum lactis and Zygosaccharomyces roux-
ii. Each of the isolates was used to ferment wheat flour dough and baked. Sensory analysis of the doughs was carried out 
on leavening, texture, aroma, taste and appearance. Saccharomyces cerevisiae performed best in leavening the dough whi-
le Debaryomyces hansenii produced doughs with the best taste  and aroma. Appearances of the doughs made with all the 
isolated yeasts did not differ significantly (P<0.05) from that of the dough that lacked yeast.

INTRODUCTION 

Palm wine is an alcoholic beverage produced by the natu-
ral fermentation of the sap of various palm trees. Among the 
palms  used  are  coconut  (Cocus  nucifera),  oil  palm  (Elaeis 
guineensis),  date  palm  (Phoenix  clotifera)  and  raphia  palm 
(Raphia hookeri) [1]. The unfermented sap is a clean, sweet, 
colourless  syrup  containing  about  10-12%  (w/v)  sugar, 
which is mainly sucrose [2]. Upon fermentation by the natu-
ral microflora, the level of this sugar decreases as it converts 
to  alcohol  and  other  products  whereas  the  sap  becomes 
milky white due to the increased microbial suspension result-
ing from the prolific growth of fermenting organisms [3]. 

Previous  study  on  the  microbiology  of Elaeis  guineensis 
have  incriminated  several  bacteria  and  yeast  flora  to  be  in-
volved  in  the  fermentation  process  [2].  Ezenroye  and  Oker-
entugba [4] reported  the genetically and physiologically dif-
ferent isolated yeasts from palm wine. These variants include 
nine species of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three Candida sp-
ecies,  one  Schizosaccharomyces  species  and  one  Kluyvero-
myces species. 

Literatures have shown that bakers have used palm wine 
as  a  cheap  alternative  dough-leavening  agent.  Palm  wine  is 
able  to  raise  dough  because  it  harbours  many  yeast  species. 
However, fermented baked dough produced using palm wine 
as a substitute for baker’s yeast is usually characterized by a 
sharp  sour  taste,  pronounced  palm  wine  flavour  and  short 
shelf  life  (Personal  communication  in  2007  with  Kole,  Kole 
bakery,  Akure,  Ondo  State,  Nigeria).  This  sour  taste  and 
short  shelf  life  could  be  attributed  to  the  large  number  of 
microbial flora, particularly the lactic acid bacteria present in 
palm wine [5] that produce metabolites undesirable for bread 
production.

  Elaeis  guineensis  harbours  many  yeast  species  [2].  Al-
though considerable amount of work has been done in  char-
acterizing  the  yeast  strains  present  in  palm  wine,  there  are 
only  few  information  available  on  the  leavening  ability  of 
the yeasts. Also, the location or environment where the palm 
wine is  can determine  the exact type of yeasts present in the 
drink. Therefore, this work was designed to isolate and iden-
tify  yeasts  present  in  palm  wine  freshly  tapped  in  Akure, 
Nigeria  and  determine  the  dough  leavening  ability  of  these 
yeasts. The organoleptic properties of the doughs made with 
these microbes were investigated. 

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY 

Microbial Analysis 

A  1  mL  aliquot  of  freshly  tapped  palm  wine  was  asepti-
cally collected from an Ijoka farm, Akure, Nigeria. The sam-
ple  was  serially  diluted  100  folds  after  which  1  mL  was 
pour-plated  [6]  in  triplicate  using  PDA  containing  0.1% 
(w/v)  lactic  acid.  The  plates  were  placed  at  30oC  ±  2oC  for 
48  –  72  hours.  After  good  growth  of  the  colonies,  distinct 
colonies were purified on fresh PDA by streaking. Each col-
ony was confirmed to be yeast by examining it under a light 
microscope using oil immersion objective after staining with 
lactophenol-in-cotton-blue dye. Pure isolates were placed on 
PDA slants and stored at 4oC until needed. 

The  yeasts  isolate  were  characterized  based  on  their  cul-
tural characteristics (colony shapes, pigment, elevation, edge 
and surface appearance). Biochemical characterization of the 
isolates  was  done  by  testing  for  ability  of  the  yeasts  to  fer-
ment  and  assimilate  sugars,  utilize  nitrate,  form  pellicle, 
spore,  pseudomycelium  and  mycelium  according  to  the 
methods  of  Harrigan,  Olutiola  et  al.,  Barnett  et  al.  and  Fa-
wole & Oso [6-9].  

Cultivation of Yeast Isolates for Dough Fermentation 

The  yeasts  isolated  were  cultured  separately  at  25oC  ± 
2oC in peptone broth medium  containing 20% (w/v) glucose 
and  lactic  acid  at  concentration  of  0.2%  in  1  litre  conical

flask  equipped  with  air  locks.  The  set-up  was  agitated  con-
tinuously for 72 hours in rotary shaker regulated at 150 rpm. 
After  good  growth  was  observed,  the  biomass  concentrate 
for  each  yeast  species  was  obtained  by  centrifuging  it  in  an 
MSE  centrifuge  machine  at  12,168  (cid:1)103  g  for  10  min.  The 
yeast  concentrates  were  washed  sufficiently  with  sterile  dis-
tilled water after which they were resuspended in sterile dis-
tilled  water.  The  same  procedure  was  applied  to  the  com-
mercial yeasts (Saf-instant and STK Royal) used as controls.  

Determination of Fermentative Ability of the Yeasts 

All the yeast isolates were used to ferment dough in order 
to test their fermentative ability. Samples of dough were pre-
pared as described by Cauvian and Young [10]. Each dough 
sample contained wheat, flour, salt, water, sugar and fat. All 
the ingredients were properly mixed. Each yeast isolate (1.41 
x 109 Cfu/mL) was used to ferment the dough. Baker’s yeast 
(STK  Royal  and  Saf-  instant)  were  used  separately  as  posi-
tive  control  yeasts  to  ferment  the  dough.  Another  set  of 
dough formulation that did not contain any yeast sample was 
prepared  as  the  negative  control.  The  dough  samples  were 
left to ferment at room temperature at 37oC ± 2oC for about 1 
hour. The doughs were baked in an oven for 1 hr at 200oC. 

Comparative Analysis of the Baked Dough Samples 

The  baked  dough  samples  were  subjected  to  sensory 
analyses by using panel of 26 enlightened judges to evaluate 
the  following  physical  parameters  namely:  leavening,  taste, 
texture, appearance and aroma. Five points grade was used in 
the analysis starting with Excellent =5, Very Good = 4, Good 
= 3, Satisfactory = 2 and Poor = 1. 

Analysis of Data 

All data obtained from sensory evaluation were subjected 
to  statistical  analysis  by  using  Analysis  of  Variance  and 
DUNCAN Multiple Range Test. Significance of variations in 
the analyzed data was tested at 95% confidence limit. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Five  morphologically  different  yeast  strains  namely 
Schizosaccharomyces  pombe,  Debaryomyces  hansenii, 
Geotrichum  lactis,  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  and  Zygosac-
charo-myces  rouxii  were  obtained  from  the  freshly  tapped 
palm wine (Table 1). The quantity and  complexity of yeasts 
isolated  from  the  palm  wine  used  in  this  study  is  in  agree-
ment  with  the  findings  of  Ezenronye  and  Okerentugba  [4]. 

The complexity  and variation in species of yeasts  isolated  is 
related  to  the  fact  that  the  yeasts  originate  from  several 
sources  such  as  the  tapping  container  (which  may  retain 
some  yeasts)  and  from  the  tapping  environment.  Further-
more, palm wine contains  a high level of  sucrose (10-12%). 
This high sugar level favours the growth of yeasts. It further 
gives credence  to the general belief held in the early days of 
research that yeasts are found in sugary substances [11]. 

The organoleptic properties of doughs fermented with the 
various yeast isolates are presented in  Figs. 1-5.  The figures 
show  that  they  compared  well  with  doughs  produced  using 
commercial  yeasts  (Saf–instant  and  STK  Royal)  in  all  sen-
sory  attributes  tested  (leavening,  texture,  aroma,  taste  and 
appearance).  All  the  isolates  showed  fermentative  ability  as 
depicted  by  their  leavening  activities  (Fig.  1).  Mean  ratings 
of  the  leavening  activities  of  the  yeasts  range  between  2.33 
(Zygosaccharomyces rouxii) and 2.83 (Saccharomyces  cere-
visiae).  This  corresponds  to  good  leavening  abilities  on  the 
sensory scale used at significant level of P<0.05. 

The analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that one of the 
commercial  yeasts  (Saf-instant)  did  not  differ  significantly 
from  Schizosaccharomyces  cerevisiae  and  Debaryomyces 
hanseni  (P<0.05)  in  its  leavening  performance.  The  com-
mercial yeasts STK  Royal and Saf-instant had mean  leaven-
ing  activities  of  2.70  and  2.40  respectively  while  the  nega-
tive control (dough which lacked yeast) scored 2.29.  

When  compared  with  the  negative  control,  the  data 
showed  that  the  isolated  yeasts  increased  the  size  of  doughs 
which  they  fermented  considerably.  This  confirms  the  basis 
of using palm wine as a substitute for baker’s yeast by some 
bakers.  The  result  is  supported  by  the  abilities  of  the  yeasts 
to  ferment  sugars  especially  glucose  and  fructose,  the  break 
down  of  which  brings  about  the  release  of  carbon  dioxide 
that  causes  dough  to  rise.  The  highest  leavening  activity  re-
corded for S. cerevisiae indicates that it is the best biological 
wheat  dough  leavener  obtained  in  this  work  because  it  per-
formed  better  than  the  two  commercial  yeasts  used  as  con-
trols. The result is in agreement with the findings of Somiari 
and  Udoh  [12]  and  Adenaike  et  al.  [13]  who  reported  that 
Saccharomyces species isolated from palm wine were found 
to be the best in leavening wheat dough. 

The  mean  texture  ratings  obtained  for  the  doughs  fer-
mented with the yeast isolates range between 2.84 (S. cerevi-
siae)  and  2.14  (Zygosaccharomyces  rouxii)  (Fig.  2).  This 
score range falls within good on the sensory scale used. The 
texture score recorded for S. cerevisiae followed the same

trend as  its leavening activity since the highest texture score 
was obtained for it. Olorunfemi and Adetuyi [14] reported  a 
similar finding. Geotrichum lactis had the next high score for 
texture  (2.82)  followed  by  Debaryomyces  hansenii  and 
Schizosaccharomyces  cerevisiae  at  2.56  and  2.40  ratings 
respectively.  Generally,  the  texture  ratings  of  doughs  fer-
mented  with  these  yeasts  are  at  very  close  range  to  their 
leavening  activity ratings, thus suggesting that besides caus-
ing dough to rise, the yeasts have improved the texture of the 
doughs they fermented. This confirmed the statement of Cor-
riher [15] that expansion of dough due to the carbon dioxide 
produced by yeasts leads to a characteristic porosity and tex-
ture  of  fermented  baked  dough.  The  low  leavening  activity 
and  texture  ratings  of  the  negative  control  (dough  which 
lacked  yeast)  confirms  the  effect  of  yeast  on  the  fermented 
baked doughs. 

Boboye et al. 

Doughs fermented with the yeasts showed varying accep-
tance  levels  of  aroma  (Fig.  3).  Debaryomyces  hansenii  pro-
duced  dough  with  the  best  aroma  (3.16).  This  was  followed 
by  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae,  Schizosaccharomyces  pombe, 
Zygosaccharomyces  rouxii  and  Geotrichum  lactis  with 
aroma  ratings  of  2.91,  2.80,  2.67  and  2.65  respectively.  All 
the  yeasts  produced  doughs  with  aroma  ratings  comparable 
with  those  of  the  commercial  yeasts.  The  good  and  very 
good  ratings  of  aroma  indicate  that  the  yeasts  were  able  to 
produce  compounds  such  as  carbonyls,  aldehydes  and  ke-
tones that have imparted appealing flavours into the doughs.  

The  mean  taste  and  appearance  scores  obtained  for  the 
dough  fermented  with  the  isolated  yeasts  and  those  of  the 
commercial  yeasts  as  well  as  the  dough  which  lacked  yeast 
range between 2.87 and 3.32 for taste and 2.76 and 3.17 for 
appearance  (Figs.  4  and  5).  The  taste  and  appearance  of  the

positive control did not differ significantly from the negative 
control.  This  means  that  the  appearance  and  tastes  of  fer-
mented doughs after baking may not be totally dependent on 
yeast activity, rather on the ingredient formulation as all the 
dough samples contained the ingredients in equal proportion. 
Hence, the iso-lated yeasts produced doughs with acceptable 
sensory attributes of taste and appearance with no significant 
difference from the commercially available yeasts. 

In  conclusion,  this  work  has  shown  that  palm  wine  con-
tains  yeasts  that  can  produce  baked  doughs  with  good  sen-
sory  attributes  that  compares  favourably  with  commercial 
yeasts  used  for  baking.  The  yeasts  isolated  from  palm  wine 
have shown considerable leavening activity.
