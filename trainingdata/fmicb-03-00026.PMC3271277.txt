In this study, both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods were used to
determine whether the iron sulﬁde mineral- and nitrate-rich freshwater nature reserve
Het Zwart Water accommodates anoxic microbial iron cycling. Molecular analyses (16S
rRNA gene clone library and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization, FISH) showed that sulfur-
oxidizing denitriﬁers dominated the microbial population. In addition, bacteria resembling
the iron-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing Acidovorax strain BrG1 accounted for a major part of the
microbial community in the groundwater of this ecosystem. Despite the apparent abun-
dance of strain BrG1-like bacteria, iron-oxidizing nitrate reducers could not be isolated,
likely due to the strictly autotrophic cultivation conditions adopted in our study. In contrast
an iron-reducing Geobacter sp. was isolated from this environment while FISH and 16S
rRNA gene clone library analyses did not reveal any Geobacter sp.-related sequences in
the groundwater. Our ﬁndings indicate that iron-oxidizing nitrate reducers may be of impor-
tance to the redox cycling of iron in the groundwater of our study site and illustrate the
necessity of employing both culture-dependent and independent methods in studies on
microbial processes.

INTRODUCTION
Redox cycling of iron has profound effects on the chemistry of soils
and sediments due to the sheer abundance of iron, and the inter-
dependence with the cycling of virtually all other biochemically
relevant elements (Stumm and Sulzberger, 1992; Davison, 1993;
Nealson et al., 2002). Iron species are subject to both chemical and
microbial transformations. Iron can be abiotically reduced in var-
ious manners. Photoreduction, and interactions with sulfhydryl
groups, organic acids, and reducing ligands, all result in reduction
of ferric oxides (Nealson and Saffarini, 1994; Castillo-Gonzalez
and Bruns, 2005). In sulfur-rich, mainly marine, environments,
hydrogen sulﬁde reduces ferric iron oxides which results in the
formation of iron sulﬁde (FeS), pyrite (FeS2), and elemental sulfur
(Thamdrup et al., 1994; Carey and Taillefert, 2005). In non-
sulﬁdogenic anoxic soils and sediments however, microbial iron
reduction, coupled to organic carbon or hydrogen oxidation, is the
dominant process (Sobolev and Roden, 2002). The importance of
microbial iron reduction has been unequivocally demonstrated:
in many environments it accounts for signiﬁcant turnover of
organic carbon, and has inhibitory effects on sulfate reduction and
methanogenesis (Nealson and Saffarini, 1994; Thamdrup, 2000;
Nealson et al., 2002). The ﬁrst described iron-reducing bacterial
species were fermenting bacteria that make use of the reduc-
tion as a means to dispose of electron equivalents (Lovley and
Phillips, 1988). Nowadays, also a large variety of microorgan-
isms, ranging from slightly psychrophilic to thermophilic, have
been described that use energy generated through iron reduc-
tion for growth. Examples of such dissimilatory iron reducers
are Geobacter sp., Rhodoferax ferrireducens, Geothrix fermentans,
Ferribacterium limneticum, Geoglobus ahangari, and Shewanella

sp. These microorganisms couple iron reduction to oxidation of a
large variety of organic compounds, hydrogen, or elemental sulfur
(Nealson and Saffarini, 1994; Cummings et al., 1999; Thamdrup,
2000; Tor et al., 2001; Kasheﬁ et al., 2002; Nevin and Lovley, 2002;
Finneran et al., 2003). Especially Geobacter species have received
considerable attention because of their ability to convert pollu-
tants such as uranium, aromatic hydrocarbons, and chlorinated
solvents (Anderson et al., 1998; Lin et al., 2005; Nevin et al., 2005;
Sung et al., 2006).

The microbial contribution to iron oxidation has long been
subject of debate between microbiologists and geochemists
(Ghiorse, 1984), especially because abiotic iron oxidation occurs
rapidly in the presence of oxygen (Sobolev and Roden, 2002;
Emerson and Weiss, 2004). Under anoxic conditions, nitrite is
a chemical oxidant of ferrous iron (Moraghan and Buresh, 1977;
Cooper et al., 2003; Coby and Picardal, 2005), although this may
require millimolar amounts. In spite of these chemical reactions,
it is presently accepted that microorganisms can contribute sig-
niﬁcantly to iron oxidation. Aerobic, acidophilic iron-oxidizing
microorganisms play an important role in the generation of acid
mine drainage (AMD; Baker and Banﬁeld, 2003). Aerobic, neu-
trophilic, iron-oxidizing microorganisms, that have to compete
with the rapid chemical oxidation, have been isolated from marine
as well as freshwater environments, ranging from iron seeps,
groundwater, and hydrothermal vents to root-plaque of wetland
plants (Emerson and Revsbech, 1994; Emerson and Moyer, 1997;
Emerson et al., 1999; Edwards et al., 2003, 2004). The ability to gain
energy from anaerobic oxidation of iron is widespread among bac-
teria. Ferrous iron serves as an electron donor for phototrophic,
purple, non-sulfur bacteria, and green sulfur bacteria under anoxic

conditions (Ehrenreich and Widdel, 1994; Heising et al., 1999).
Several bacterial species and an archeon, Ferroglobus placidus, have
been described that couple ferrous iron oxidation to nitrate reduc-
tion (Hafenbradl et al., 1996; Benz et al., 1998; Straub et al., 2004;
Senko et al., 2005; Kumaraswamy et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2006).
It has been suggested that on a global scale nitrate-reducing, iron-
oxidizing bacteria are more important than the phototrophs, since
they are not limited by the availability of light (Straub et al., 2001).
Straub et al. (1998) used ferrihydrite produced by iron-
oxidizing nitrate reducers to enrich iron-reducing bacteria. Indica-
tions for the coexistence of aerobic iron-oxidizing and anaerobic
iron-reducing microorganisms in close proximity to each other
were found by Weiss et al. (2003) and Roden et al. (2004). Fur-
thermore, microbial anoxic iron cycling by a single organism
(a Geobacter sp.) capable of both dissimilatory iron reduction
and nitrate-dependent iron oxidation was proposed by Weber
et al. (2005) and iron respiration with formate as electron donor
as well as iron oxidation with nitrate as electron acceptor was
demonstrated for the anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacterium
Kuenenia stuttgartiensis (Strous et al., 2006).

Iron sulﬁde mineral- and nitrate-rich soils in freshwater
ecosystems provide both a source of reduced iron and an elec-
tron acceptor that could promote growth of anaerobic, non-
phototrophic iron-oxidizers. Oxidized iron species resultant from
iron-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing activity could in turn serve as
electron acceptors for microbial iron reducers. To determine
whether the iron sulﬁde mineral- and nitrate-rich freshwater
environment of the nature reserve Het Zwart Water (Venlo, The
Netherlands) provides a suitable habitat for anoxic microbial iron
cycling, groundwater from an iron sulﬁde/and nitrate-rich soil was
examined using both culture-dependent and culture-independent
methods.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLING PROCEDURE
In October 2004, a groundwater sample was collected in the fresh-
water nature reserve Het Zwart Water (51˚24
E, Venlo,
The Netherlands) at 1.5 m depth, at a site situated 1.5 m from the
edge of lake De Venkoelen. Previous measurements had shown
increased concentrations of acid volatile sulfur (an indication
for the presence of iron sulﬁde minerals) nitrate, soluble iron,
and sulfate around the groundwater table of this system (Haai-
jer et al., 2006). The collected groundwater was enriched in
iron(hydr)oxides (visible orange precipitates). The sample was
transported to the lab in a glass serum bottle (10 ml) closed with
an aluminum crimp seal. Immediately upon arrival at the lab,
high molecular weight DNA was extracted by standard proce-
dures from 0.2 ml of sample and 0.3 ml of the sample was ﬁxed
for ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) by addition of 4%
w/v paraformaldehyde (0.9 ml), incubating on ice (2 h), centrifug-
ing (15 min, 13.000 rpm), and washing the resulting pellet with
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and ﬁnally adding 100% EtOH
and PBS (1:1) after which the sample was stored at −20˚C until
analysis. Furthermore, mineral media enrichment cultures (20 ml,
for composition, see Haaijer et al., 2006) were established through
10-fold dilution and supplemented with either ferrous iron chlo-
ride and nitrate (iron oxidizer culture medium) or ferric iron

citrate and acetate (iron reducer culture medium), from anaerobic
sterile stock solutions (5 mM ﬁnal concentrations). These enrich-
ment cultures were incubated under a gas atmosphere of N2/CO2
(80/20%), and incubated at 30˚C and 150 rpm for 1.5 months
to determine whether the groundwater possessed anoxic iron-
oxidizing respectively iron-reducing capacity. All further liquid
culturing was performed under the same conditions for at least
3 weeks with ﬁnal concentrations of 8 mM ferrous iron and 2 mM
nitrate in the iron oxidizer culture medium and 8 mM ferric iron
citrate and 1.5 mM acetate in the iron reducer culture medium
unless speciﬁed otherwise.

ENRICHMENT AND ISOLATION OF ANAEROBIC IRON-OXIDIZING AND
IRON-REDUCING BACTERIA
The initial iron-oxidizing and reducing enrichment cultures were
transferred by 10-fold dilution and after 1.5 months of incubation
used to inoculate iron oxidizer and iron reducer dilution series
(10 ml tubes, 10-fold dilutions down to 1010 dilution). These dilu-
tion series were incubated for 1 month without agitation. The three
highest dilutions (106, 107, and 108 for the iron reducer series,
103, 104, and 105 for the iron oxidizer series) exhibiting activity
(changes in color: green to whitish-orange for the iron oxidizer,
orange to white/green for the iron reducer series) were then used
to inoculate new iron oxidizer and reducer cultures (20 ml vol-
ume, 20-fold dilution). Ferric and ferrous iron, nitrate, and nitrite
concentrations were determined (see below) at least once a week.
When a substrate was depleted, new additions were done from ster-
ile stock solutions. The same procedure was applied to subsequent
subcultures.

The 20-ml iron-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing culture obtained
from the 105 dilution was used to inoculate a larger volume enrich-
ment culture (50-fold dilution, 50 ml) that was transferred once
(50-fold dilution, 50 ml). To obtain template DNA for PCR (see
below), 25 ml of this last culture was centrifuged (40× g, 1 min)
to pellet ferrous iron precipitates, the supernatant taken and cen-
trifuged (2600× g, 5 min) to pellet the bacteria, and the resulting
pellet was used to isolate high molecular weight DNA.

The 20-ml iron-reducing culture obtained from the 108 dilu-
tion was used to inoculate a larger volume enrichment culture
(50-fold dilution, 50 ml). This culture was then transferred once
(50-fold dilution, 50 ml) and from the resulting culture a 500-ml
enrichment (100-fold dilution, incubation at room temperature,
magnetic stirring: 150 rpm) was derived. Medium of this culture
was replenished when ferric iron was depleted by allowing it to
settle for at least 6 h and decanting after which fresh medium was
added and the anaerobic gas atmosphere re-applied. The medium
was replenished three times before DNA for PCR was extracted
from 25 ml culture material as described above. The 500-ml culture
was transferred six times (10-fold dilution). To exclude non-iron-
reducing contaminants, the iron-reducing culture was checked by
plating 1 ml portions on rich Luria Bertani (LB) medium supple-
−1).

These plates were incubated at 30˚C under a N2/CO2 80/20%
gas atmosphere. As long as growth was observed on these plates,
iron-reducing dilution series were repeated (3×). When no more
contaminant, non-iron-reducing, growth was detected, concentra-
tions of acetate, ferric iron, and ferrous iron were monitored in a

50-ml iron-reducing culture over a 90-h period. After this, 0.3 ml
of the culture was ﬁxed for FISH analyses as described before.
To obtain single colonies of iron-reducing bacteria, liquid iron

reducer mineral medium was solidiﬁed with agarose (15 g l
and inoculated with 1 ml aliquots from iron-reducing cultures
and incubated at 30˚C under a N2/CO2 80/20% gas atmosphere
for at least 1 month.

ISOLATION OF THIOBACILLUS DENITRIFICANS STRAIN K6.2: A
SULFUR-OXIDIZING DENITRIFIER
An enrichment culture capable of iron sulﬁde oxidation at the
expense of nitrate had been obtained previously from an iron
sulﬁde-rich soil layer (Haaijer et al., 2006) and was used to iso-
late a sulfur-oxidizing denitriﬁer (Thiobacillus denitriﬁcans strain
K6.2). In short, a dilution series (10 consecutive 10 ml volume 10-
fold dilutions) in mineral medium (for composition: see Haaijer
et al., 2006) amended with 5 mM thiosulfate and 8 mM nitrate
per dilution was derived from the enrichment. After incubation
at 30˚C, 150 rpm under a gas atmosphere of N2/CO2 (80/20%)
for 2 weeks, the highest dilution (105) exhibiting growth was
identiﬁed by visual inspection (turbidity) and used to establish
a 50-ml culture which was subsequently transferred twice (20-
fold dilution after 1 month of incubation). Aliquots of culture
material were checked for the presence of heterotrophic contam-
inants as described above for the iron reducer cultures. Finally,
half of the ﬁnal pure subculture’s volume was used to extract
DNA for PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis as described
below.

CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
Nitrate, nitrite, ferrous iron, and total iron analyses were per-
formed as described previously (Haaijer et al., 2006, 2007). Acetate
was measured through injections (10 μl) of acidiﬁed (5% v/v
formic acid) samples on a Hewlett–Packard model 5890 gas chro-
matograph equipped with a ﬂame ionization detector (195˚C) and
a HP INNOwax column (30 m× 0.32 m× 0.5 μm). Column tem-
perature was increased from 35 to 110˚C. Isobutyric acid (0.4 mM
ﬁnal concentration) was added as an internal standard.

16S rRNA GENE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS
Because most samples contained a high amount of iron species,
isolated high molecular weight DNA was puriﬁed prior to PCR
(QIAEX II gel extraction kit, Qiagen). Hot-start PCR reac-
tions were performed in a Tgradient PCR apparatus (What-
man Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). Primer speciﬁcations were
described previously (Haaijer et al., 2006). The general bac-
terial 16S rRNA gene PCR primers 616F and 630R yielded
products of about 1500 bp. Direct sequencing was performed
on the PCR product obtained for the pure culture of T. den-
itriﬁcans strain K6.2 using sequencing primers M13F, M13R,
1390R, and 610IIF. PCR products of the iron-reducing and oxi-
dizing enrichments were puriﬁed once again prior to cloning.
The TOPO TA cloning kit was used according to the instruc-
tions supplied by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Groningen, The
Netherlands). Isolation of plasmid DNA was performed with
the FlexiPrep kit (Amersham Pharmacia P-L Biochemicals Inc.).
Clones were checked by restriction analysis of plasmid DNA

(EcoR1, Fermentas UAB, Vilnius, Lithuania). A clone library of
the groundwater was constructed by partial sequencing (594–
840 bp fragments) of 67 clones with primer 610IIF. Preliminary
screening of the iron-oxidizing and iron-reducing cultures was
performed by partial sequencing (10 clones and 5 clones respec-
tively) with primer 610IIF. One of the clones from the iron-
reducing culture was selected for full-sequencing with sequencing
primers M13F, M13R, 1390R, and 610IIF. In addition, a persis-
tent non-iron-reducing contaminant growing on rich medium
plates inoculated with material from the iron-reducing culture
was identiﬁed by using colony material suspended in MQ as a
PCR template, followed by direct partial sequencing with primer
610IIF. 16S rRNA gene sequences were compared with their clos-
est relatives by BLASTN searches1 or by pairwise alignment with
selected relatives2. With the RDP classiﬁer tool3 (Wang et al.,
2007), clones were assigned to the taxonomical hierarchy pro-
posed in Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, release 6.04.
Further phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were
conducted using the software program MEGA version 5.0 (Tamura
et al., 2011). The clone library data was organized by deﬁn-
ing operational taxonomic units (OTU’s) in which sequences
exhibited ≥97% sequence identity. To evaluate the sampling
effort in the clone library (Singleton et al., 2001), the cover-
age of the library (C) was calculated according to the equation

C = [1− (n1/N )]× 100%, where n1 is the number of OTUs rep-

resenting a single clone, and N is the total number of clones
analyzed.

ACCESSION NUMBERS
Sequences (16S rRNA gene) from the groundwater clone library
are available in GenBank under accession numbers DQ997625–
DQ997691. Sequences from cultures are available under acces-
sion number EF014493 (representative clone oxo8 from the
iron-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing culture), EF014495 (nearly full-
length sequence from the iron-reducing culture), EF014494 (con-
taminant in the iron-reducing culture), and EF079668 (nearly
full-length sequence of T. denitriﬁcans strain K6.2).

FISH AND MICROSCOPIC INSPECTIONS
Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses were performed as
described before (Haaijer et al., 2006). Vectashield (Vector Lab-
oratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) mounting medium with
DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was used to enhance the
ﬂuorescent signal and stain all DNA. Probes were selected based
on the sequencing results from the clone library and cultures. A
bacterial probe mix of Cy-5-labeled probes EUB338, EUB338 II,
and EUB338 III (Daims et al., 1999) was used to hybridize all Bac-
teria. Probes Geo 1423, EPS 681 (targeting Geobacter sp. respec-
tively Epsilonproteobacteria, Haaijer et al., 2008), Betthio 1001
(betaproteobacterial Thiobacilli, Haaijer et al., 2006), BrG1-829,
and BrG2-830 (iron-oxidizing denitriﬁers, Straub and Buchholz-
Cleven, 1998) were used to speciﬁcally detect organisms of interest.

Freshwater anoxic iron cycling bacteria

The total cell number (DAPI) in the groundwater was determined
by analysis of 50 images. To quantify speciﬁc probe signals, 10
images were analyzed for each probe. As a control, background
ﬂuorescence was determined by analysis of 10 images of DAPI-
stained groundwater without probes. Speciﬁc probe signals were
only regarded as signiﬁcant when they exceeded this number
(5± 1.8% of the total DAPI count) in a statistically signiﬁcant
manner (Student’s t -test).

CELL COUNT AND 16S rRNA CLONE LIBRARY
The iron sulﬁde- and nitrate-rich freshwater wetland Het Zwart
Water was assumed to provide a suitable environment for anoxic
iron cycling bacteria. The groundwater collected from Het Zwart
Water contained 8± 3× 107 ml
−1 bacteria based on the enumer-
ation of DAPI-stained cells. The 16S rRNA gene sequence-based
clone library derived from the bacteria present in the groundwa-
ter had a coverage of 66% and resulted in the identiﬁcation of
30 separate OTU’s. Table 1 provides an overview of these OTU’s
and provides information on the microbial processes that the ﬁrst
BLASTN hit with a cultured species is associated with for each
OTU whenever such physiological information was available. If no
published data was available for the microbial processes associated
with the ﬁrst BLASTN hit with a cultured species from GenBank,
source information is listed in Table 1 instead. An exception was
made for OTU 1 which encompasses 16S rRNA gene sequences
within the genus Thiobacillus. This genus harbors both species
converting nitrate only to nitrite (e.g., Thiobacillus thioparus) and
T. denitriﬁcans a species capable of complete denitriﬁcation to
dinitrogen. These species share a high 16S rRNA gene sequence
similarity of about 98%. Therefore, a comparison was made for
OTU 1 sequences with the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the denitri-
fying, sulfur-oxidizing T. denitriﬁcans strain K6.2 obtained within
this study.

As described below, the culture-independent and culture-
dependent methods used in this study, yielded contrasting results
for iron-oxidizing nitrate reducers, and iron reducers, respectively.
In addition, sulfur-oxidizing denitriﬁers were found the most
abundant physiologically distinct group.

IRON-OXIDIZING, NITRATE REDUCERS
The clone library data from the groundwater (Table 1) con-
tained multiple (OTU11, 9% of total clones) sequences strongly
resembling (≥97% sequence identity) the iron-oxidizing, nitrate-
reducing Acidovorax strain BrG1 (Buchholz-Cleven et al., 1997;
Straub et al., 2004). FISH analysis of the groundwater sample,

with a combination of probe BrG1-829, and competitor probe
BrG2-830, showed the in situ abundance of strain BrG1-like
microorganisms (25± 9% of the total DAPI count). The pri-
mary iron-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing enrichment culture derived
from the groundwater exhibited activity (visible as a color change
from green to whitish-orange due to the oxidation of ferrous
iron). The dilution series derived from this primary enrichment

demonstrated the presence of 105 ml
Subsequent subcultures exhibited iron-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing
activity. Stoichiometry of these cultures was in good agree-
ment with the theoretical values of 10 mol ferrous oxidized at
the expense of 2 mol of nitrate. In one of the subcultures for
example 1.5 mM of ferrous iron was oxidized at the expense of
0.4 mM nitrate, accompanied by a minor formation of nitrite
(0.05 mM).

Despite the abundance of Acidovorax strain BrG1 iron-
oxidizing denitriﬁers suggested by the clone library and FISH
analyses data, these organisms were not detected in the ﬁnal 50 ml
volume enrichment culture by 16S rRNA analysis. Instead, a Kleb-
siella-like bacterium was detected. The consensus 16S rRNA gene
sequence obtained from the enrichment (10 clones, 830 bp), was
identical to the sequence of representative clone oxo8 and exhib-
ited 99% sequence similarity to the Klebsiella pneumoniae strain
described by Ludwig et al., 1995, accession number X87276). The
clone library of the original sample contained a clone (Table 1;
OTU13) with 99% sequence identity to the 16S rRNA gene
sequence obtained from the culture, indicating the presence of
this organism in the groundwater. Upon further transfer of the
iron-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing culture, the activity was lost and
addition of acetate as an organic co-substrate did not restore
activity (data not shown).

IRON REDUCERS
No 16S rRNA gene sequences of known iron-reducing species
could be identiﬁed within the clone library data. FISH analysis
of the groundwater using Geobacter-speciﬁc probe Geo1423 did
not yield signiﬁcant hybridization (<5± 1.8% of the total DAPI
count cells hybridized). The iron-reducing dilution series of the
initial enrichment culture however showed that this culture con-
−1 iron-reducing bacteria. Subcultures were readily
tained 108 ml
obtained and very active: the medium of all subcultures needed
to be replenished at least once a week. 16S rRNA gene sequence
analysis demonstrated the presence of a Geobacter sp. in the ﬁnal
enrichment. The consensus sequence (ﬁve clones, 804 bp) and the
nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence (1526 bp) generated
exhibited 100% sequence identity. Both sequences exhibited 99%
sequence identity to the Geobacter sp. previously described by
Cummings et al., 2000, accession number Y19191). Plating on
rich medium showed a persistent contamination with a Citrobac-
ter freundii-like organism. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequence
of 684 bp obtained from this organism exhibited 99% sequence
identity to C. freundii strain DSM 30039 (accession number
AJ233408, Sproer et al., 1999). The C. freundii-like organism
did not possess any iron-reducing capacity as demonstrated by
a lack of iron reduction after 2 months of incubation of 250 ml
iron reducer medium inoculated with this organism. Incuba-

Haaijer et al.

Freshwater anoxic iron cycling bacteria

these microorganisms are proposed as the mediators for anoxic
iron oxidation in the groundwater from Het Zwart Water. In the
iron sulﬁde- and nitrate-rich environment of Het Zwart Water
these bacteria could be of particular importance. Edwards et al.
(2004) demonstrated accelerated iron sulﬁde mineral dissolu-
tion in the presence of iron-oxidizing bacteria. This hypothesis
is supported by earlier ﬁndings of the presence of this type of
bacterium in an iron sulﬁde- and nitrate-fed enrichment cul-
ture (Haaijer et al., 2006). However, despite their abundance,
strain BrG1-like bacteria were not detected in the ﬁnal 50 ml
volume enrichment culture. Instead, a Klebsiella-like bacterium
was detected. Iron-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing activity by Kleb-
siella sp. cells has been described by Senko et al. (2005) under
non-growth conditions. It therefore seems likely the K. pneumo-
niae-like organism detected in the iron-oxidizing nitrate-reducing
culture did not possess the capacity of generating sufﬁcient energy
for growth by coupled iron oxidation and nitrate reduction. This
fact together with the absence of any obvious iron-reducing bac-
teria in the groundwater, as demonstrated with the molecular
methods, shows that complete microbial iron cycling could not
be convincingly demonstrated in the groundwater of Het Zwart
Water. The isolation of the iron-reducing Geobacter sp., however,
indicates that bacterial iron reduction at the least could be impor-
tant in other compartments (e.g., the surrounding soil) of Het
Zwart Water.

The iron-reducing Geobacter isolate converted 1 mM of acetate
at the expense of 5 mM ferric iron and FISH analysis conﬁrmed
the pure culture status. This ratio does not agree well with the the-
oretical stoichiometry of 8 mM ferric iron reduced at the expense
of 1 mM acetate (Lovley et al., 1987). The contribution of assim-
ilation to the total amount of acetate consumed, however, can be
high: 46% of total acetate metabolized was assimilated by Geobac-
ter sulfurreducens grown in batch culture on fumarate and acetate
(Galushko and Schink, 2000). This phenomenon may also explain
the observed low amount of ferric iron reduced in the Geobacter
sp. culture described presently.

DIFFERENCES IN THE DETECTION OF IRON-OXIDIZING NITRATE
REDUCERS AND IRON REDUCERS
Molecular analyses (16S rRNA gene clone library and FISH)
showed that the Acidovorax strain BrG1-like,
iron-oxidizing
nitrate reducers accounted for a major portion of the microbial
community of the groundwater sample from Het Zwart Water.
In contrast to the abundance demonstrated by the molecular
data, the cultivation procedure did not lead to the enrichment
or isolation of this type of bacterium. A probable cause is the
completely autotrophic culturing conditions adopted in the iron-
oxidizing enrichments. Iron-oxidizing nitrate-reducing activity
was ﬁrst reported (Straub et al., 1996) for a solely lithotrophic
enrichment culture. Isolated strains, however, seem dependent
on the presence of organic co-substrates (Straub et al., 2004).
In contrast to the results for iron-oxidizers, an iron-reducing
Geobacter sp. culture was readily obtained. The molecular analy-
ses, however, suggested the contribution of this bacterium was of
little numerical relevance in the groundwater sample. Together,
these results, conﬂicting as they are for the functional groups
of interest in this study, illustrate the necessity to employ both

FIGURE 1 | Activity of the pure iron-reducing Geobacter sp. culture.

SULFUR-OXIDIZING NITRATE REDUCERS
The clone library data (Table 1; OTU 1) revealed 42% of the clones
exhibited a sequence identity higher than 98% to the 16S rRNA
gene sequence of T. denitriﬁcans strain K6.2. FISH analysis of
the groundwater material from Het Zwart Water with betapro-
teobacterial Thiobacilli-speciﬁc probe Betthio1001 corroborated
the abundance of these microorganisms (23± 9% of the total
DAPI count). Iron sulﬁde- and nitrate-rich environments like Het
Zwart Water will be enriched in sulﬁde in addition to reduced iron
as a possible electron donor for microbial growth. In addition to
betaproteobacterial Thiobacilli, likely candidates for sulﬁde oxida-
tion at the expense of nitrate are epsilonproteobacterial species like
Sulfurimonas denitriﬁcans (previously known as Thiomicrospira
denitriﬁcans; Schippers and Jørgensen, 2002; Takai et al., 2006)
and members of the genus Sulfuricurvum (Kodama and Watan-
abe, 2004). Signiﬁcant numbers of Epsilonproteobacteria were
not detected (probe EPS 681) in the groundwater. In addition,
the clone library did not contain epsilonproteobacterial sequences
(Table 1).

DISCUSSION
IRON CYCLE BACTERIA IN THE GROUNDWATER OF HET ZWART WATER
Although T. denitriﬁcans possesses iron-oxidizing capacity in the
presence of nitrate, speciﬁc reaction rates are much lower, weeks
opposed to days, than those of the speciﬁc iron-oxidizing nitrate
reducers previously described by Straub et al. (1996). Given the
abundance of strain BrG1-like bacteria, it therefore seems most
likely that the betaproteobacterial Thiobacilli detected in the
groundwater are primarily involved in the oxidation of reduced
sulfur compounds in Het Zwart Water as was demonstrated before
(Haaijer et al., 2006, 2007).

Based on the abundance of Acidovorax strain BrG1-like bac-
teria, suggested by the clone library and FISH analyses data,

on microbial activity. To choose only one approach is to disre-
gard the biases inherent to this approach, such as primer-induced
biases in clone libraries (Forney et al., 2004), or selection of
fast-growing microorganisms in culture media (Grosskopf et al.,
1998). Inventory descriptive studies like ours, allow development

of more direct approaches, necessary to understand ecosystem
functioning.
