Cellular 

functions  are 

intimately 
associated  with  rapid  changes  in 
membrane shape. Different mechanisms 
interfering with the lipid bilayer, such as 
the insertion of proteins with amphipatic 
helices  or  the  association  of  a  protein 
scaffold, trigger membrane bending. By 
exerting force on membranes, molecular 
motors can also contribute to membrane 
remodeling. Previous studies have shown 
that actin and myosin 1 participate in the 
invagination  of  the  plasma  membrane 
during  endocytosis  while  kinesins  and 
dynein  with  microtubules  provide  the 
force to elongate membrane buds at recy-
cling  endosomes  and  at  the  trans-Golgi 
network (TGN). Using live cell imaging 
we have recently shown that a myosin 1 
(myosin  1b)  regulates  the  actin  depen-
dent post-Golgi traffic of cargo and gen-
erates force that controls the assembly of 
F-actin foci and promotes with the actin 
cytoskeleton  the  formation  of  tubules 
at the TGN. Our data provide evidence 
that  actin  and  myosin  1  can  regulate 
membrane  remodeling  of  organelles  as 
well as having an unexpected role in the 
spatial  organization  of  the  actin  cyto-
skeleton.  Here,  we  discuss  our  results 
together with the role of actin and other 
myosins that have been implicated in the 
traffic of cargo.

Introduction

During  embryonic  development  numer-
ous  biological  processes,  including  cell 
migration,  membrane  traffic  and  tissue 
reorganization,  require  rapid  changes 
in  membrane  shape.  For  example  dur-
ing 
intracellular  transport  of  cargo, 
membranes  of  organelles  acquire  curved 
shapes 
formation  of 

leading  to  the 

tubular  and  vesicular  carrier  precursors. 
The current model regarding membrane 
remodeling is largely based on studies of 
plasma membrane deformations that lead 
to  membrane  invagination  during  endo-
cytosis.  This  model  involves  two  major 
steps  for  membrane  deformation  and  a 
third  step  that  implies  change  in  mem-
brane continuity and triggers the scission 
of vesicles from the plasma membrane.

In  the  first  step,  membrane  bend-
ing can be achieved by different mecha-
nisms.  Change  in  lipid  composition  or 
integral membrane proteins can influence 
membrane bending.1 Proteins that insert 
amphipatic helices into the proximal lipid 
monolayer, such as proteins with ENTH 
(Epsin  N-Terminal  Homology) 
or 
ANTH  (AP180N-Terminal  Homology) 
domains,  also  induce  membrane  curva-
ture.2 These proteins have been involved 
at the plasma membrane for endocytosis 
and  at  the  trans-Golgi  network  (TGN) 
for  the  exit  of  CI-mannose-6-phosphate 
receptor  (MPR).  Scaffolding  proteins, 
including  proteins  with  BAR  domains, 
make  membrane  curvature  by  imposing 
their  crescent  shape  on  the  membrane 
with  which  they  interact.3,4  F-BAR  pro-
teins with a positive curvature have been 
implicated  at  the  plasma  membrane  for 
endocytosis.5,6  Clathrin,  or  other  coats 
that are recruited to membrane domains 
by  adaptor  complexes  like  AP1,  AP2, 
AP3, AP4, are believed to also contribute 
to  membrane  curvature.7  Interestingly, 
proteins  with  ENTH,  ANTH  or  BAR 
domains  interact  with  the  adaptor  com-
plexes,  suggesting  that  the  adaptor/coat 
machinery  coordinates  the  formation  of 
membrane  curvature  with  the  sorting 
of  cargo  addressed  to  different  cellular 
destinations.2,8

In our recent study we found that a pool 
of Myo1b localizes at the TGN in HeLa 
cells.23  We  thus  investigated  whether 
Myo1b  participates  in  the  trafficking  of 
different  cargo  that  transit  through  the 
TGN.  We  showed  that  the  cellular  dis-
tribution  of  MPR  that  cycles  between 
the  TGN  and  sorting  endosomes  was 
impaired  by  down  expression  or  overex-
pression  of  Myo1b  in  HeLa  cells.  Using 
live  cell  imaging  we  showed  that  the 
exit  of  GFP-MPR  from  the  TGN  was 
inhibited  in  cells  depleted  for  Myo1b  by 
siRNA,  while  the  traffic  of  MPR  from 
endosomes  to  the  TGN  was  not  altered. 
The  delivery  of  newly  synthesized  lyso-
somal  hydrolases  to  endosomes,  such  as 
cathepsin  D  and  β-hexosaminidase,  was 
also  affected.  However,  instead  of  being 
secreted,  as  previously  reported  in  KO 
cells for MPR,24 β-hexosaminidase activ-
ity  was  decreased  in  cell-culture  media 
in the absence of Myo1b. These findings 
suggest  that  Myo1b  inhibits  not  only 
post-Golgi  transport  to  endosomes  but 
also  post-Golgi  transport  to  the  plasma 
membrane. Indeed, the kinetics of TGN 
exit  of  the  neurotrophin  receptor  p75 
(p75), that localizes at the plasma mem-
brane  at  steady-state,12  was  slowed  down 
in  the  absence  of  Myo1b.  Interestingly, 
the exit of MPR and p75 depends on an 
intact actin cytoskeleton.25-27 In contrast, 
the  exit  of  a  lipid-raft  anchored  protein 
(GPI-GFP),  that  leaves  the  TGN  inde-
pendently  of  the  actin  cytoskeleton,  was 
not  regulated  by  Myo1b.26,27  We  con-
cluded  that  Myo1b  controls  the  exit  of 
cargos requiring actin dynamics and that 
are  delivered  either  to  endosomes  or  via 
the exocytic pathway to the plasma mem-
brane.  Previous  reports  have  suggested 
that  inhibition  of  cargo  exit  from  TGN 
impairs  the  homeostasis  of  the  Golgi 
complex  and  consequently  disturbs  its 
morphology.28-30 We observed by conven-
tional electron microscopy that depletion 
of Myo1b produced shorter Golgi stacks, 
dilated mostly at the rims, and an abnor-
mal accumulation of peri-Golgi vesicular 
profiles with various shapes and sizes. Exit 
of  MPR  from  the  TGN  depends  on  the 
formation  of  tubular-carrier  precursors 
that  elongate  and  break  into  post-Golgi 
carrier  vesicles.14,31  Using 
time-
lapse  imaging  we  observed  a  dramatic

deformation at the plasma membrane or at the tgn. (A) By interacting with npF, F-BAR protein or 
Etnh proteins control the side of actin polymerization for membrane invagination at the plasma 
membrane and at the tgn. (B) Kinesin and microtubules then elongate the membrane of the tgn.

In the second step, in the case of mor-
phogenesis of carrier vesicles, a generation 
of forces allows for the elongation of the 
membrane leading to membrane tubules 
prior  to  scission.  Motor  proteins  and 
cytoskeleton  are  commonly  employed 
to  generate  forces.  Actin  polymerization 
itself can push membranes. At the plasma 
membrane, proteins with F-BAR domains 
interact  with  members  of  the  Wiskott 
Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP) fam-
ily,  also  named  nucleation-promoting 
factors  (NPF),  that  activate  the  Arp2/3 
complex  and  hence  induce  actin  polym-
erization.5  If  the  BAR  domain  protein 
is  located  between  NPF  molecules,  the 
force  generated  by  actin  polymerization 
leads to membrane invagination (Fig. 1). 
In  addition  to  actin  polymerization,  a 
yeast  myosin  from  class  I  has  been  pro-
posed to contribute to membrane invagi-
nation  during  endocytosis  (Fig.  1).9,10 
In  contrast,  kinesins  and  dynein  with 
microtubules  provide  the  force  to  elon-
gate  membrane  buds  at  recycling  endo-
somes and at the TGN, two of the main 
protein sorting stations of the cell at the 
cross roads of the exocytic and endocytic 

pathways (Fig. 1).11-13 Recent experimen-
tal evidence indicates that several NPFs, 
including WASP, WASH and WHAMM, 
and several myosins from the classes II, V, 
VI  and  XVIII,  contribute  to  cargo  traf-
ficking  at  the  TGN  and  endosomes.14-19 
Do these myosins and actin polymeriza-
tion  participate  in  membrane  remodel-
ing  leading  to  the  formation  of  carrier 
vesicles? We recently raised this question 
and  showed  that  the  actin  cytoskeleton 
and a myosin I (myosin 1b) promote the 
formation of tubular-carrier precursors at 
the TGN.

Myo1b Regulates TGN Exit  
and Formation of Tubular- 

Precursor Carriers

We  have  shown  previously  that  myo-
sin1b  (Myo1b)  localizes  at  the  plasma 
membrane in regions enriched with actin 
filaments,  and  at  early  endosomes,  mul-
tivesicular  endosomes  and  lysosomes.20,21 
Furthermore, Myo1b was involved in the 
traffic of cargo along the endocytic path-
way  and  together  with  F-actin  it  modu-
lated the shape of sorting endosomes.20,22

and cytoplasmic carrier vesicles in absence 
of  Myo1b.  Conversely,  overexpression  of 
Cherry-Myo1b  induced  the  formation  of 
long  GFP-MPR  tubular-precursors.  To 
determine whether the force generated by 
Myo1b triggers cargo exit from the TGN 
and  could  be  at  the  origin  of  membrane 
deformation, we analyzed whether Myo1b 
rigor mutant (N160A) with a single muta-
tion  in  the  motor  domain  and  a  Myo1b 
mutant  (E476K)  with  a  single  mutation 
in  the  “switch  2”  of  the  motor  domain, 
both  being  unable  to  generate  force  to 
move  F-actin  in  vitro,  could  rescue  the 
normal distribution of MPR upon endog-
enous Myo1b KD. We found that expres-
sion  of  recombinant  wild-type  Myo1b, 
but  not  Myo1b-rigor  or  Myo1b-E476K, 
rescued  the  normal  steady-state  distribu-
tion of MPR. We concluded that Myo1b 
regulates the exit of cargo from the TGN 
by generating a force that could contrib-
ute to the formation of tubular-precursor 
carriers.

Myo1b Controls the Assembly  

of F-Actin Foci at the TGN

Growing evidence indicates that the actin 
cytoskeleton  plays  a  role  in  membrane 
trafficking  at  the  TGN.14,25,28,29  and  that 
actin foci localizes in the TGN region.28,32 
However, the role of actin dynamics at an 
early  stage  of  post-Golgi  carrier  biogen-
esis,  such  as  formation  of  tubular-carrier 
precursors, was unknown. By monitoring 
the  behavior  of  F-actin  foci  at  the  TGN 
in  cells  expressing  Cherry-LifeAct  and 
GFP-MPR,  we  observed  that  F-actin 
foci  remained  relatively  non  motile  and 
stable  at  the  opposite  of  the  behavior  of 
F-actin  at  the  plasma  membrane  where 
a  burst  of  actin  occurs  during  the  for-
mation  of  coated  pits  to  enable  vesicle 
formation  and  ligand  uptake.33  Thirty 
percent of F-actin foci codistributed with 
MPR associated to the TGN and F-actin 
foci were in close proximity to the TGN 
membrane  when  MPR  tubules  formed, 
suggesting that F-actin foci interact with 
the  TGN  membrane.  We  showed  that 
F-actin foci are required for the formation 
of  tubular-carrier  precursors  emanating 
from the TGN and give rise to the forma-
tion  of  post-Golgi  carriers.  The  Arp2/3

end of F-actin. if myo1b is immobilized because of its interaction with the membrane then the

complex  has  been  proposed  to  nucleate 
the  actin  filaments  that  compose  F-actin 
foci at the TGN membrane.34 The reduc-
tion  of  F-actin  foci  in  the  TGN  region, 
upon  Arp2/3  complex  KD  by  siRNA, 
phenocopied  the  accumulation  of  MPR 
in  the  TGN,  as  seen  in  the  Myo1b  KD. 
Furthermore, KD of the Arp2/3 complex 
reduced  the  formation  of  tubular-carrier 
precursors  and  consequently  the  num-
ber  of  cytoplasmic  MPR  carrier  vesicles. 
Myosins  generate  force  by  interacting  in 
an  ATP  dependant  manner  with  F-actin 
filaments.  We  found  that  Myo1b  was  in 
association with F-actin foci in the TGN 
region and that its depletion reduced the 
number  of  F-actin  foci  at  the  TGN  by 
60%. Myo1b depletion also decreased the 
number  of  Arp2/3  structures  in  the  vol-
ume occupied by MPR in the TGN area, 

but not at the ventral plasma membrane. 
While  Myo1b  overexpression  increased 
the  number  of  Arp2/3  structures  in  the 
Golgi region with no significant increase 
at the ventral plasma membrane.

Together, these findings allowed us to 
propose that Myo1b tethers F-actin foci to 
the  TGN  membrane.  Recently,  Kobama 
and  colleagues  reported  the  ability  of  
Myo1b,  to  bind  to  phosphoinositides.35 
As  Myo1b  contains,  in  its  tail  domain, 
a  cluster  of  basic  amino  acids  as  well  as 
a  PH-like  motif,  Myo1b  could  bind  the 
TGN membrane via its PH motif. Similar 
to the other members of the subgroup of 
short tail myosins 1, Myo1b does not con-
tain  a  second  actin  binding  domain  or  a 
protein-protein interacting motif, such as 
a  single  Src  homology  domain  3  (SH3), 
that  can  bind  proteins  involved  in  actin

ber  of  the  short  tail  myosin  1  subgroup, 
myosin 1c has been proposed to spatially 
control actin assembly to the plasma mem-
brane  in  Xenopus  Oocytes  via  its  motor 
domain.37  Myo1b,  similarly  to  Myo1c, 
could  spatially  control  actin  assembly  at 
the  TGN  membrane  by  interacting  with 
F-actin  via  its  motor  domain  and  at  the 
membrane via its PH motif. In agreement 
with  this  hypothesis,  we  found  that  the 
force  generated  by  Myo1b  was  required 
to  tether  F-actin  foci  to  the  TGN  mem-
brane. Using an in vitro motility assay, we 
observed that the rigor mutant remained 
bound to F-actin while the E476K mutant 
displayed  a  weak  affinity  for  F-actin. 
Myo1b,  but  not  Myo1b-rigor  or  Myo1b-
E476K,  rescued  the  normal  steady-state 
distribution of F-actin foci at the TGN.

Our  findings  can  be  summarized  in 
a  model  where  the  force  generated  by 
Myo1b  controls  F-actin  foci  orientation 
and binding to the TGN membrane. The 
force  generated  by  Myo1b  could  thereby 
facilitate  actin  polymerization  and  con-
tribute  to  membrane  curvature  of  the 
TGN  (Fig.  2).  According  to  this  model, 
Myo1b-Tail  interactions  with  the  TGN 
membrane  should  be  strong  enough  to 
avoid Myo1b-Tail slipping and Myo1b dis-
sociation  in  the  TGN  membrane  during 
the  force  produced  by  Myo1b-motor  on 
F-actin. Further work needs to be done to 
test this hypothesis.

Is Myo1b Function Coordinated 

with Actin Nucleation?

The Arp2/3 complex can be activated and 
recruited  to  the  TGN  through  the  inter-
action  of  clathrin  coat  with  Cyfip1/2, 
triggering  WAVE/N-WASP  actin  nucle-
ation.14  However,  this  mechanism  can-
not  account  for  the  actin  dependent  exit 
of p75 since this receptor exits the TGN 
independently of clathrin.38 ARF1 (ADP-
ribosylation  factor  1)  recruits  COPI  and 
clathrin  coat  complexes  on  Golgi  sub-
domains  and  also  activates  the  Arp2/3 
complex  via  cdc42  and  N-WASP.39-41 
Furthermore,  expression  of  an  active  
cdc42  mutant  activates  the  TGN  exit  of 
p75  (ref.  42).  In  addition,  several  NPFs, 
including  WASP  and  WHAMM,  con-
tribute  to  the  trafficking  of  cargo  at  the 

Golgi and TGN.14,17 These data, together, 
highlights the existence of multiple TGN 
exit  pathways  with  distinct  mechanisms 
to  recruit  and  activate  the  Arp2/3  com-
plex  at  the  TGN  membrane.  It  is  likely 
that  Myo1b  functions  in  these  different 
pathways  by  tethering  the  newly  polym-
erized  F-Actin  to  the  TGN  membrane. 
Furthermore, we have previously reported 
that Myo1b participates in membrane traf-
ficking along the endocytic pathway and in 
particular to the transfer of cargo from the 
membrane of the sorting endosomes to the 
internal vesicles.22 We observed that over-
expression of Myo1b increases membrane 
extensions  at  the  surface  of  these  endo-
somes.  Conversely,  we  recently  observed 
that  Myo1b  KD  decreases  the  formation 
of such extensions (Almeida CG, unpub-
lished  data).  Thus,  Myo1b  may  function 
to tether newly polymerized F-actin to the 
membranes of different types of organelles 
and thereby trigger membrane remodeling 
of organelles.

Do Other Myosins Implicated  
in Membrane Traffic Contribute  

to Membrane Remodeling  

of Organelles?

Myosins from classes I and II could con-
tribute  to  organelle  and  plasma  mem-
brane  remodeling.  Yeast  myosins  1,  with 
a long tail that interacts with NPF via an 
acidic  motif  at  its  C-terminus,  were  the 
first  myosins  reported  to  be  involved  in 
membrane  remodeling.9,10  More  recently, 
another  long  tail  myosin  1,  myosin  1e, 
that could interact with NSF via its SH3 
domain,  has  been  suggested  to  play  a 
similar role in mammalian cells.43,44 It has 
been  proposed  that  these  myosins  elon-
gate the plasma membrane and/or cleave 
the  newly-formed  membrane  invagina-
tion leading to the endosomes.10 A recent 
report  showed  that  depletion  of  myosin 
II inhibits scission of tubular-carrier pre-
cursors  positive  for  Rab6.16  We  observed 
that  inhibition  of  the  ATPase  activity  of 
this myosin inhibits the scission of MPR 
tubules. This suggests that myosin II con-
tributes to membrane remodeling leading 
to  scission  of  tubular  carrier  precursors 
downstream  of  Myo1b  function  at  the 
TGN  (Almeida  CG,  unpublished  data). 
Whether this myosin contributes directly 

to the scission or whether it acts in coor-
dination  with  dynamin  remains  to  be 
clarified.

Recent experimental evidence indicates 
that members of other classes of myosins 
contribute to membrane trafficking along 
both the endocytic and exocytic pathways 
and suggests that these myosins function 
by  using  distinct  molecular  mechanisms 
in  distinct  pathways.  For  example,  myo-
sin  VI  has  been  found  to  be  involved  in 
the  first  step  of  endocytosis  as  well  as  in 
the endocytic recycling pathway and more 
recently in the fusion of secretory vesicles 
to  the  plasma  membrane.19,45-47  Although 
depletion  of  myosin  VI  reduces  tubule 
formation in the endocytic recycling path-
way, its direct role in membrane remodel-
ing for these different steps of membrane 
trafficking needs to be further examined.19 
Myosins  V  contribute  to  endocytic  recy-
cling of a variety of receptors and cargos. 
Yet,  although  the  isoform  Vb  is  associ-
ated  with  tubular  networks,  there  is  no 
evidence  indicating  that  myosins  V  can 
remodel membrane of the recycling endo-
somes.48-50 It is likely that myosin 18a par-
ticipates in retrograde trafficking since its 
membrane  receptor,  GOLPH3,  has  been 
shown  to  contribute  to  retrograde  Golgi 
trafficking  in  yeast  and  to  be  associated 
with the retromer complex in mammalian 
cells.51 Myosin 18a depletion inhibits the 
frequency of formation of Golgi  carriers. 
However,  due  to  the  question  raised  by 
the sequence of its motor domain, it is not 
clear whether this myosin can generate a 
force  to  remodel  membrane.  Myosin  18a 
presents  a  non-conserved  residue  in  the 
“switch  2”  region  of  the  motor  domain 
that abolishes cellular function of myosin 
II  in  dictyostellium  and  instead,  myosin 
18a  presents  an  actin-binding  site  in  an 
unusual  PDZ  domain  at  its  N-terminus 
in order to have an ATP dependent actin-
binding  site.52  Further  work  needs  to  be 
done to determine whether these myosins 
contribute  to  membrane  remodeling  of 
organelles  by  generating,  with  F-actin,  a 
force on organelle membrane.

In conclusion, our recent work with that 
of  Miserey-Lenkei  and  colleagues,  pro-
vides two examples of myosins involved in 
membrane  trafficking  that  control  mem-
brane remodeling of organelles.16,23 These 
new results provide an emerging concept

of the machinery implicated in membrane 
elongation  and/or  membrane  scission, 
two  steps  of  membrane  remodeling  that 
lead  to  the  formation  of  carrier  vesicles. 
Furthermore, they suggest that the func-
tion of some of these myosins needs to be 
coordinated  to  achieve  the  formation  of 
carrier vesicles.
