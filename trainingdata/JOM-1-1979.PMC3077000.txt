Background: Plasma antibody measurements of antibody levels to periodontal pathogens may be used to
support diagnosis, disease activity, classification, and prognosis of periodontitis.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term stability of plasma antibody levels against
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis.
Design: Plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels against the pathogens were analyzed annually
during 15 years from 21 voluntary subjects, whose periodontal status was not known at the point of selection.
The total number of plasma samples was 315. In connection of the last sampling, the clinical and
radiographic periodontal status was examined. Pooled bacterial samples from periodontal pockets, as well as
salivary samples were collected for A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis detection, and antibody
determinations, respectively. According to the clinical status, six subjects had periodontitis, whereas 15 did
not.
Results: Plasma IgG-class antibody levels to periodontal pathogens remained extremely stable during the
15-year period and no significant (p0.05) intra-individual variations were observed. Retrospectively, the
average plasma IgG antibody levels against A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were 1.62.3 (pB0.05)
and 1.41.7 (pB0.05) fold higher in the subjects with periodontitis than those without, respectively, during
the whole 15-year tracking. As expected, at the time of the periodontal examination the plasma and salivary
IgG antibody levels were associated both with periodontitis and bacterium-positivity.
Conclusions: Plasma IgG levels against A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis are extremely stable during
15 years both in subjects with and without periodontitis.

Major periodontal pathogens include Aggregati-

bacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyro-
monas gingivalis. The association between
P. gingivalis and periodontitis is stronger even though a
carrier-state of the species may exist (1). A. actinomyce-
temcomitans has a dual role in the oral flora: it has been
associated with aggressive forms of periodontitis (2), but
the bacterium can also be found in the oral cavity of

healthy individuals (3). The bacterial load in periodontal
pockets leads to the activation of host-bacterial interac-
tions. To establish an infection,
the pathogen must
overcome numerous surface barriers, such as epithelium
and mucus, and also the innate immunity and adaptive
immunity (4). Periodontal pathogens stimulate B cell
antigen-pecific
activation mainly
immune
and

actinomycetemcomitans

through classical

response. A.

P. gingivalis are capable of
inducing high antibody
response that can in fact exceed those found in many
other pathological bacterial infections (5).

Plasma and saliva antibody measurements have
been used to diagnose periodontitis, estimate its activity,
classification and prognosis, and success of treatment (5).
Several studies have reported elevated levels of plasma
immunoglobulin G (IgG) against periodontal pathogens
especially in patients with aggressive periodontitis (69).
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the predominant immunoglo-
bulin in saliva, and salivary IgA plays a role in the local
immune defense system. In addition to the plasma-derived
IgG and IgA, certain subclasses of IgG and IgA can be
produced locally in the periodontal pockets (10). Antibody
production, especially that of IgG and IgA, is considered to
have a protective role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis
(11, 12). It has also been suggested that antibodies may not
necessarily need to decrease periodontal pathogen loads in
order to exert a protective effect, but they may neutralize
toxins and proteolytic enzymes as well as promote opso-
nization, and complement activation (11).

The stability of IgG-class antibody levels has been
investigated in a few follow-up studies. The follow-up
time in those studies has varied from two to three years
(13, 14). IgG-class antibody levels showed long-term
stability; no decrease has been reported after periodontal
treatment (6, 14) or treatment has lowered the IgG levels
only temporarily (15).

Earlier studies have mainly focused on the relationship
between antibody levels and severity of periodontitis or
between bacterial presence and their homologous anti-
bodies. The aim in this study was therefore to investigate
the long-term stability of plasma antibody levels against
A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis in plasma
samples analyzed annually from the same individuals
during 15 years.

Material and methods

Subject sample
This report is based on the 15-year collection of blood
samples from a rural population in Leppa¨virta, Savolax,
Finland, whose selenium status was followed by annual
blood sampling. The original sample included 26 men
and 19 women in 1985 (16). The local public health-care
center recruited subjects. Volunteers for the periodontal
examination were recruited by a questionnaire, and 9 men
and 12 women participated. During the 15 years, the
subjects had had dental check-ups by their general
practitioners and none of them had previously been
treated by a periodontologist. However,
they were
instructed to seek periodontal treatment after the exam-
ination if necessary. The characteristics of the partici-

pants at the end of the study are shown in Table 1. All the
participating subjects gave their informed consent.

Clinical and radiographic examination
The subjects were examined with respect to visible plaque
and bleeding on probing (17), probing depth (periodontal
pockets]5 mm), and clinical attachment loss at six sites
per tooth, at all present teeth (Table 1). One dentist (JA)
performed all the clinical examinations. WHO probe (LM
Dental LM 550B Si, LM-instruments Oy/Ab, Pargas,
Finland) was used in the examinations. Subjects were
categorized into those with and without periodontitis
according to the following criteria: subjects with period-
ontitis had at least one site with a periodontal pocket
deeper than 5 mm and clinical attachment loss (see
Table 1).

Periodontal status and possible infectious foci of
periodontium and/or alveolar bone were detected from
analog panoramic tomographs. The number of peri-
apical lesions, angular bony defects (they were at least to
the middle third of the root length), furcation lesions in
molars, and pericoronitis in third molars were recorded.

Plasma and salivary samples
Plasma samples were collected once a year for 15 years
from the 21 participants and stored at 208C. The
following samples were collected at the end of the 15-year
period.

Paraffin-stimulated salivary samples were collected for
five minutes. The salivary sample was divided into two
aliquots, of which 2 ml was centrifuged immediately at
12,000 rpm for five minutes and frozen on dry ice. The
frozen samples were brought to the research laboratory
at the Institute of Dentistry, University of Helsinki,
Helsinki, within 48 hours and stored at 708C.

Bacterial samples and antibody measurements
From the 21 participants in the study, pooled bacterial
samples from the 14 most inflamed periodontal pockets
in each subject were collected with sterile curettes at the
end of
the study. The samples were transported to
the laboratory in vials containing 2 ml of viability
preserving medium no. III (VMGA III) medium, and
cultured. A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were
identified as previously described (18, 19). Briefly, for A.
actinomycetemcomitans, 100-ml aliquots of undiluted and
102 dilutions of samples were inoculated on Tryptic soy
bacitracin vancomycin (TSBV)-agar plates and incubated
in 5% CO2 in air at 368C for three days. A. actinomyce-
temcomitans grew as typical adherent colonies, which
were catalase-positive. For P. gingivalis, 100-ml aliquots of
104 and 105 were inoculated on Brucella agar plates
and incubated in anaerobic jars at 378C for 10 days.
P. gingivalis grew as dark-pigmented colonies, which had

Bacterial DNA was isolated from the VMGA III
medium according to the manufacturer’s instructions
using Chelex 100 resin, and A. actinomycetemcomitans
and P. gingivalis were detected by PCR as reported earlier
(20, 21). In every series of PCR, chromosomal DNA
extracted from A. actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC43718)
and P. gingivalis (W50) strains served as positive controls,
and water served as a negative control.

Plasma IgG and salivary IgG and IgA antibodies
against A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were
detected by multiserotype-ELISA as previously described
(6). The strains used as formalin-killed whole cell
antigens were ATCC29523, ATCC43781, ATCC33384,
IDH781, IDH1708, and C59 representing A. actinomy-
cetemcomitans serotypes a, b, c, d, e, and a non-
serotypeable strain, respectively, and ATCC33277, W50,
and OMGS434 representing P. gingivalis serotypes a, b,
and c, respectively. Plasma or saliva diluted in antibody
buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.5% bovine
plasma albumin) was incubated at room temperature for

two hours. For the determinations, four dilutions of each
sample were used in duplicate. The dilutions were as
follows: plasma samples for the detection of A. actino-
IgG 1:500, 1:1,500, 1:4,500, and
mycetemcomitans
1:13,500 and for the detection of P. gingivalis IgG
1:100, 1:400, 1:1,600, and 1:6,400, and salivary samples
for the detection of either A. actinomycetemcomitans or
P. gingivalis IgG and IgA were 1:3.3, 1:10, 1:30, and 1:90.
The results were calculated as area under the plasma
concentration time curve (AUC)
from the dilution
curves. The inter-assay coefficients for variation as
calculated from values of the reference serum applied
on each plate were 6.3 and 5.5% for A. actinomycetem-
comitans and 5.1 and 4.7% for P. gingivalis IgA and IgG,
respectively.

Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using the SPSS for Win-
dows, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
Differences in the clinical characteristics and antibody
levels between the two study groups were analyzed by
the MannWhitney U test or Chi-square test. Interac-
tions between parameters were examined using Pearson

Results

Demographic and clinical data
Table 1 provides a summary of the demographic and
clinical data of the subject sample. According to our
classification criteria, the subjects with periodontitis at
the time of the clinical examination had higher number of
deep (]5 mm) periodontal pockets, attachment
loss
levels, and community periodontal index of treatment

needs (CPITN) value compared to those without period-
ontitis. No differences were found in the bleeding on
probing and visible plaque or in the number of angular
bony defects detected from the radiographic pictures
between the two groups. There were no statistical
differences in the general health and current smoking
between the subjects with (n6) and without (n15)
periodontitis.

Antibody levels at the end of the study
Mean plasma and salivary IgG antibody and salivary IgA
antibody levels against A. actinomycetemcomitans and P.
gingivalis in the periodontitis and non-periodontitis
groups at the end of the study are shown in Table 2.

levels (m), and standard deviation (vertical lines). One box plot column represents one subject. Subjects marked with # are those
who were PCR-positive for P. gingivalis (a) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (b) at the end of the study.

Mean salivary IgG antibody levels against A. actinomy-
cetemcomitans and both salivary and plasma IgG levels
against P. gingivalis were significantly higher in subjects
with periodontitis compared to the levels in the period-
ontally healthy subjects. There were no differences in the
salivary IgA antibody levels against A. actinomycetemco-
mitans and P. gingivalis between the groups.

Long-term inter and intra-individual antibody
variations
The mean annual plasma antibody IgG levels against
A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis during the

15-year period in subjects with and without periodontitis
are shown in Fig. 1. Plasma IgG levels against A.
actinomycetemcomitans were 1.62.3 fold higher in sub-
jects with periodontitis than in those without (pB0.05).
Mean IgG levels against P. gingivalis were 1.41.7 fold
higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally
healthy subjects (pB0.05). The intra-individual variation
in plasma IgG antibodies against P. gingivalis (Fig. 2a)
and A. actinomycetemcomitans (Fig. 2b) during the
15 years are shown for all subjects. The individual

Detection of bacteria
Mean plasma and salivary IgG levels were associated with
the bacteria detected by PCR (Table 3). IgG levels against
A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis in both
plasma and saliva were significantly higher in subjects
positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis
compared to the subjects negative for the bacteria,
respectively. Salivary IgA levels against A. actinomyce-
temcomitans and P. gingivalis were not significantly
elevated in PCR-positive subjects for either of
the
bacteria. Of the two A. actinomycetemcomitans PCR-
positive subjects one was culture-positive. Seven subjects
were PCR-positive for P. gingivalis, and five of them were
culture-positive.

Correlation analyses
Correlation coefficients between the periodontal status
and plasma, and salivary IgG and IgA antibody levels
against A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis at the
end of the study are shown in Table 4. The number of
angular bony defects correlated with IgG antibody levels
against P. gingivalis in plasma and saliva and IgA antibody
levels against A. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva. The
number of deepened periodontal pockets (]5 mm) corre-
lated with IgG antibody levels against P. gingivalis in both

Discussion

Tracking of plasma antibodies
The present study is a retrospective 15-year tracking of
plasma antibody levels against A. actinomycetemcomitans
and P. gingivalis. Throughout the whole time frame, the
mean plasma antibody levels remained extremely stable,
and only minor, non-significant
individual variation
was seen. Furthermore, our data showed elevated mean
antibody levels against both A. actinomycetemcomitans
and P. gingivalis in subjects, who were diagnosed as
having periodontitis at the end of the 15-year time period,
compared to the periodontally healthy.

The main result in the present study was the remark-
able stability of plasma IgG levels in both the period-
ontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, even though
the periodontal classification was done at the end of the
study. The limitation of the study is that we did not have
the dental history of the subjects who participated in the
study, and it is possible that they had had active period-
ontitis at some point during the 15 years. This is, however,
not likely since at the time of the dental examination,
none of them were currently in periodontal treatment or
in the maintenance care. The subjects had got occasional
periodontal treatment by their general practitioners, but
none of them had sought for treatment by a specialized
periodontologist.

Tracking of plasma antibodies

The antibody detection method we use in our labora-
tory has been published earlier (22). Antigens in the assay
represent A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes ae and a
non-serotypeable strain, and P. gingivalis serotypes ac
(6). When the IgG-class antibody levels to pathogens are
summed up, the assay has a specificity and sensitivity of
90 and 71%, respectively, for finding periodontitis by
measuring antibody levels from plasma samples (6). Since
the aim of the present study, however, was not to validate
further the multiserotype-ELISA, the antibody levels
were not summed up.

Our findings are consistent with previous studies.
Papapanou and co-workers demonstrated an overall
stability of plasma IgG-class antibody titers to 19 period-
ontal bacteria over a 30-month period for both period-
ontitis patients and periodontally intact control subjects
(14). Periodontal treatment among those with the disease
did not affect the plasma antibody levels. Furthermore,
Dye and co-workers (2009) reported that serum IgG titers
to selected periodontal species are feasible in epidemio-
logic studies using a combined serologic/demographic
approach (23). Several other studies have shown higher
plasma IgG levels against specific periodontal pathogens
in patients with periodontitis than in periodontally
healthy individuals (5, 9, 24, 25). It has been suggested
that elevated antibody levels against A. actinomycetem-
comitans and P. gingivalis exert a protective role in the
progression of periodontitis (11). In a 36-month follow-
up study, the patients who had low homologous plasma
antibody levels together with cultivable A. actinomyce-
temcomitans and P. gingivalis, showed a positive predic-
tive value for periodontitis disease recurrence (11). Our
retrospective study, however, does not suggest a protec-
tive role for the plasma IgG-class antibody levels.

Cultivable A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis
can serve as markers for destructive periodontal disease in
adult subjects (26). In the present study, we were able to
detect two A. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects and
seven P. gingivalis-positive subjects by PCR. From those
subjects, bacteria could be cultivated in one and five cases,
respectively. Plasma and salivary IgG levels were elevated
in the P. gingivalis-positive subjects as detected with both
PCR method and cultivation. In the A. actinomycetemco-
mitans-positive subjects, the plasma and salivary IgG levels
were elevated in the PCR-positive group. This can be
explained by the small number of A. actinomycetemcomi-
tans-positive subjects in the population.

Plasma and salivary IgG levels correlated with each
other. At the year of periodontal examination, both
plasma and salivary antibody levels against P. gingivalis
were significantly higher in the periodontitis group than in
the periodontally healthy group. Concerning A. actinomy-
cetemcomitans only the salivary IgG levels were elevated in
the periodontitis group. A trend was seen also for plasma
IgG against A. actinomycetemcomitans to be elevated in

the periodontitis group even though not statistically
significant. The small study population may explain this;
from 28 subjects participating originally in the study
annually during the 15 years, only 21 attended the clinical
examination. In addition, all affected subjects had chronic
periodontitis, that is more commonly associated with the
presence of P. gingivalis than A. actinomycetemcomitans
(27). Although IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin in
saliva, our study showed elevated salivary IgG levels
against both A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis
in periodontitis. In the whole saliva samples, the total
immunoglobulin originates both from crevicular fluid and
exocrine secretion. Therefore, there is some discrepancy
compared to previous studies, in which salivary IgA have
been measured in subjects with periodontitis.

Ha¨gewald and co-workers reported that a group of
patients with aggressive periodontitis had lower total IgA
levels than periodontally healthy subjects (28), whereas
Henskens and associates found no difference in saliva IgA
concentrations between patients with chronic periodontitis
and periodontally healthy subjects (29). The present study
supports the latter observation showing no differences in
the IgA levels of periodontitis and periodontally healthy
groups.

Overall, plasma and salivary IgG and IgA levels
against A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis cor-
related significantly with periodontal status. There was a
positive correlation with the number of
sites with
deepened periodontal pockets, mean attachment loss,
and angular bony defects detected from the radiographic
pictures. Only three of the 21 participants in the present
study were current smokers, and all of them belonged to
the periodontally healthy group. Smoking is a strong risk
factor for periodontal diseases and may have an impact
also on immunoglobulin levels (8, 12, 30), but in this
study the number of current smokers was too small to
study the effect of smoking on the antibody production.
In conclusion, the mean plasma IgG levels against
A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were stable
during the entire 15-year period. The mean plasma
antibody levels were also correlated with the periodontal
status, the levels were significantly higher in subjects with
periodontitis compared to the periodontally healthy. In
this study population, periodontitis was moderate and
the number of subjects with periodontitis was small.
Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm the
observations among patients with severe periodontitis.
