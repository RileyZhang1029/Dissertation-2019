Vitis  hybrid  (Sheridan)-Robus  coreanus  red  wine  was  vinified  by  fermentation  of  a  mixture  of  Vitis  hybrid  and  Robus  coreanus
must  at  25oC  for  10  days.  The  Vitis  hybrid-Robus  coreanus  red  wine  had  ethanol  contents  of  10.9%.  It  had  high  antihy-
pertensive  angiotensin  I-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitory  activity  of  57.8%  and  antioxidant  activity  of  64.8%.  Changes
in  the  physicochemical  properties  and  functionality  of  the  Vitis  hybrid-Robus  coreanus  red  wine  was  investigated  during  a
post-fermentation  period  of  three  months.  The  ACE  inhibitory  activity  of  the  red  wine  increased  as  the  post-fermentation
period  prolonged,  and  showed  the  highest  ACE  inhibitory  activity  of  70.4%  60  days  post-fermentation.  However,  the  anti-
oxidant  activity  declined  significantly  to  47.2%  during  the  post-fermentation  period  of  60  days.  In  terms  of  sensory  eval-
uation,  the  Vitis  hybrid-Robus  coreanus  red  wine  had  the  best  acceptability  60  days  post-fermentation.

Grapes  contain  phenolic  compounds  which  have  numer-
ous  biological  health  benefits,  such  as  antioxidant  activity
[1],  inhibitory  activity  on  lipoprotein  oxidation  [2-4],  plate-
let  aggregation  inhibitory  activity  [5],  anti-inflammatory
activity  [6],  blood  cholesterol  lowering  activity,  and  anti-
microbial  activity  [7, 8].  Many  results  on  the  health  bene-
fits  of  red  wine  have  also  been  reported  [9-11].  Kallithraka
et  al.  [12]  reported  that  red  wine  may  reduce  mortality
rate  from  coronary  heart  disease.  Arnous  et  al.  [13]  also
reported  that  the  1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl  radical  scav-
enging  activity  and  the  hydroxyl  radical  scavenging  activ-
ity  of  red  wine  were  closely  correlated.  However,  only
some  studies  on  the  quality  and  acceptability  of  Korean
red wines from various grape varieties have been reported
because they are extremely limited in offering unique char-
acteristics,  acceptability,  and  high-value  physiological  func-
tionality [14, 15]. In spite of some functionalities of Korean
red  wines,  such  as  the  antioxidant  activity  of  wines  [16,
17]  and  the  cardiovascular  and  antidementia  functional-
ities  of  red  wines  [18],  it  is  necessary  to  develop  new
functional red wines with good acceptability.

Rubus  coreanus  (Bokbunja)  belongs  to  the  family
Rosaceae  and  it  is  found  exclusively  in  South  Korea,
China,  and  Japan  [19].  It  has  some  therapeutic  effects  on
spermatorrhea,  enuresis,  asthma,  and  allergies  because  it
contains  various  bioactive  compounds,  including  phenolic

acids,  triterpenosides,  flavonoids,  and  ellagitannin  [20].
Therefore,  consumption  of  Rubus  coreanus  has  increased
as by raw material of some juices and functional foods.

In  a  previous  paper  [21],  we  reported  on  the  quality
and  antihypertension  activity  of  Vitis  hybrid-Vitis  coigne-
tiae  red  wine.  In  this  study,  we  describe  physiological
functionalities  of  Vitis  hybrid  (Sheridan)-Rubus  coreanus
red  wine  brewed  with  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  KCTC
7904.  We  also  studied  changes  in  the  physicochemical
properties  and  functionality  of  the  red  wine  during  three
months of post-fermentation at 4oC.

Materials  and  Methods

Materials,  yeast  and  chemicals. Vitis  hybrid  (Sheridan)
and  Rubus  coreanus,  harvested  in  2010,  were  purchased
from  a  commercial  market.  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae
KCTC  7904  from  the  Laboratory  of  Food  Biotechnology
at  Paichai  University  (Daejeon,  Korea)  was  used  for  pre-
paring the red wine.

The  angiotensin  I-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  was
extracted from rabbit lung acetone powder (Sigma Chemi-
cal Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), and hippuric acid-histidine-
leucine,  fibrin,  pyrogallol,  and  2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydra-
zyl  (DPPH)  were  purchased  from  Sigma  Chemical  Co.
Unless otherwise specified, all the chemicals were of ana-

Vinification  of  Vitis  hybrid  (Sheridan)-Rubus  coreanus
red wine. Vitis hybrid grapes were washed, crushed, and
supplemented  with  Rubus  coreanus  (5%).  The  mixture
was  then  adjusted  to  24o  brix  by  the  addition  of  sugar.
After  adding  150 ppm  of  K2S2O5,  we  left  the  mixture  to
settle for 5 hr and then inoculated it with 1% Saccharomy-
ces  cerevisiae  KCTC  7904  which  was  incubated  in  must
for  24 hr.  The  mixed  must  was  fermented  for  10  days  at
25oC and then filtered and stored at 4oC for 90 days [18].

General  analysis  and  sensory  evaluation. pH  was
measured with a pH meter (Fisher Scientific, Denver, CO,
USA)  and  the  ethanol  content  was  determined  with  an
alcoholic  meter  (Ceti  Optical  Instruments,  Antwerp,  Bel-
gium) after water distillation [22].

Sensory  evaluation  of  the  Vitis  hybrid-Rubus  coreanus
red  wine  was  performed  by  50  trained  sensory  panels  on
the  basis  of  a  quantitative  descriptive  analysis  [22].  The
taste  and  odor of  the  red wines  were  evaluated  on  a  scale
of  1  to  5,  where  5  was  the  best  score.  The  mean  scores
were obtained and plotted as a polygonal graph. The over-
all  acceptability  according  to  the  taste  and  odor  was  eval-
uated  using  the  mean  value  of  a  hedonic  scale  with
scoring values from 1 (extremely disliked) to 9 (extremely
well liked).

Assay  of  physiological  functionalities. After  concen-
trating  50 mL  samples  of  the  Vitis  hybrid-Rubus  coreanus
red wine to 5 mL, we assayed the activity of ACE inhibi-
tion  using  the  method  of  Cushman  and  Cheung  [23].  We
preincubated a mixture containing 100 mM sodium borate
buffer  (pH  8.3),  300 mM  NaCl,  3 units  of  ACE,  and  an
appropriate  amount  of  red  wine  for  10 min  at  37oC.  The
reactions  were  initiated  by  the  addition  of  50 µL  of  hip-
his-leu  at  a  final  concentration  of  5 mM.  The  reactions
were  terminated  after  30 min  of  incubation  through  the
addition  of  250 mL  of  1.0 N  HCl.  The  liberated  hippuric
acids  were  extracted  with  1 mL  of  ethyl  acetate  and
0.8 mL  of  the  extracts  were  dried  with  a  Speed  Vac  Con-
centrator  (EYELA  Co.,  Tokyo,  Japan).  The  residue  was
then  dissolved  in  1 mL  of  the  sodium  borate  buffer  and
the  absorbance  was  measured  at  228 nm  to  estimate  the
ACE inhibitory activity.

Fibrinolytic  activity  was  assayed  by  the  method  of
Fayek  and El-Sayed  [24]. We  added 0.5 mL  of each sam-
ple to 3 mL of the substrate solution (0.6% fibrin in 0.1 M
McIlvaine  buffer,  pH  7.0)  and  incubated  them  at 40oC  for
10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 mL
of  0.4 M  TCA  for  30 min  and  then  filtered  with  What-
man  filter  paper  No.  2.  We  then  placed  a  reaction  mix-
ture  of  1 mL  filtrate,  5 mL  0.4 M  Na2CO3,  and  1 mL  1 N
Folin  reagent  at  room  temperature  for  30 min.  The  amount

of  tyrosine  released  from  the  fibrin  was  determined  from
a  tyrosine  standard  curve  based  on  absorbance  meas-
urements  at  660 nm.  One  unit  of  activity  was  defined  as
the  production  of  1 µg  of  tyrosine  per  min  for  a  1 mL
sample.

The  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA 

(HMG-CoA)
reductase inhibitory activity was assayed spectrophotomet-
rically  by  measuring  the  rate  of  decrease  in  absorbance  at
340 nm  due  to  the  oxidation  of  NADPH  [25].  A  0.5 mL
volume  of the  reaction mixture contained  the following:  a
potassium  phosphate  buffer,  pH  7.0,  50 µM;  dithiothio-
threitol,  2 µM;  NADPH,  0.3 µM;  HMG-CoA,  0.15 µM;
and  enzyme,  100 µg  of  protein.  Two  reaction  mixtures
were  preincubated  in  a  2 mm  light  path  glass  cuvette  for
5 min at 37oC. For the assay, we added HMG-CoA to one
reaction  mixture  and  we  added  HMG-CoA  with  each  red
wine  extract  in  the  other  reaction  mixture.  The  mixtures
were  assayed  at  37oC  in  a  recording  spectrophotometer.
The  initial  velocity  of  the  reaction  was  measured  and  the
net rate of the NADPH oxidation was determined by sub-
tracting the rate of oxidation in the absence of HMG-CoA
from  the  rate  observed  with  both  substrates  present.  We
calculated  the  HMG-CoA  reductase  inhibitory  activity  as
follows:

HMG-CoA reducatse inhibitory activity (%)

= [1 − (A340 of sample − A340 sample of blank)/

(A340 of control − A340 control of blank)] × 100

The antioxidant activity was assayed using DPPH [17]. A
0.8 mL  DPPH  solution  (12.5 mg  of  DPPH  dissolved  in
100 mL  of  ethanol)  was  added  to  0.2 mL  of  a  sample,
shaken  for  10 sec,  and  left  for  10 min.  We  then  deter-
mined  the  absorbance  at  525 nm.  The  antioxidant  activity
was  calculated  as  [1 − (absorbance  of  reaction  mixture-
absorbance of sample alone)/absorbance of blank] × 100.

Results  and  Discussion

Ethanol  content  and  physiological  functionalities  of
Vitis  hybrid  (Sheridan)-Rubus  coreanus  red  wine. As
shown  in  Table  1,  ethanol  content  of  the  Vitis  hybrid-
Rubus  coreanus  red  wine  was  10.9%  after  fermentation
for 10 days. This was similar or slightly lower than results
of  a  previous  study  on  Vitis  hybrid-Vitis  coignetiae  red
wine  (13.9%)  [21]  and  than  the  alcohol  content  in  four
kinds of Korean red wines (11.4 to 12.0%) [18].

Vitis hybrid-Rubus coreanus red wine had antihyperten-
sive  ACE  inhibitory  activity  of  57.8%  after  fermentation
for  10  days.  This  ACE  inhibitory  activity  of  the  red  wine
was  lower  than  the  corresponding  value  of  Vitis  hybrid-
Vitis  coignetiae  red  wine  (68.5%)  [21],  Paecilomyces  japon-
ica wine (67.3%) [26], Ganoderma lucidum wine (63.4%)
[22], Korean Vitis labrusca L (Concord) red wines (65.1%)
[18], and chamomile wine (36.7%) [27].

Furthermore,  Vitis  hybrid-Rubus  coreanus  red  wines
had  an  antioxidant  activity  of  64.8%  after  10  days  fermen-
tation.  This  suggested  that  consumption  of  this  red  wine
may  help  in  regulating  free  radical  reaction-mediated  dis-
orders,  such  as  coronary  heart  disease,  atherogenesis,  and
aging.  No  fibrinolytic  activity  or  HMG-CoA  reductase
inhibitory activity of Vitis hybrid-Rubus coreanus red wine
were detected or were detected in only very low levels.

Changes  in the  antihypertensive  ACE  inhibitory  activ-
ity and antioxidant activity of Vitis hybrid-Rubus corea-
nus  red  wine  during  post-fermentation. As  shown  in
Table  2,  the  ACE  inhibitory  activity  of  the  Vitis  hybrid-
Rubus  coreanus  red  wine  increased  as  the  post-fermenta-
tion period extended to 60 days. After 60 days of post-fer-
mentation,  the  level  of  ACE  inhibitory  activity  reached
70.4%.  However,  the  antioxidant  activity  was  significantly
decreased  to  47.2%  during  a  post-fermentation  period  of
60 days.

nus red wine. The total acceptability of the Vitis hybrid-

and  odor  of  Vitis  hybrid  (Sheridan)  Robus  coreanus  red
wine  after  60  days  and  90  days  of  post-fermentation.

post-fermentation was investigated (Fig. 1). The Vitis hybrid-
Rubus coreanus red wine had a strong sour and sweet fla-
vors  and  very  weak  bitter  or  alcoholic  flavors.  From  this
sensory  evaluation,  we  concluded  that  the  Vitis  hybrid-
Rubus  coreanus  red  wine  after  60  days  of  post-fermenta-
tion  is more acceptable  than  after  90 days  of  post-fermen-
tation. These results are similar to Vitis hybrid-Vitis coignetiae
red wine after 60 days of post-fermentation [21].

In  conclusion,  the  optimal  vinification  process  of  the
Vitis hybrid-Rubus  coreanus red wine was done using 5%
Rubus  coreanus  in  Vitis  hybrid  must.  The  mixture  was
fermented for 10 days at 25oC with Saccharomyces cerevi-
siae  KCTC  7904  and  then  subjected  to  60  days  of  post-
fermentation. We suggest that the Vitis hybrid-Rubus core-
anus  red  wine  from  this  study  is  a  new  functional  red
wine  with  a  high  antioxidant  activity,  high  antihyperten-
sion, and good acceptability.
