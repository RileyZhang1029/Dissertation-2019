The family Reoviridae is one of the largest virus families with genomes composed of 9–12
double-stranded RNA segments. It includes members infecting organisms from protists to
humans. It is well known that reovirus genomes are prone to various types of genome alter-
ations including intragenic rearrangement and reassortment under laboratory and natural
conditions. Recently distinct genetic alterations were reported for members of the genus
Mycoreovirus, Mycoreovirus 1 (MyRV1), and MyRV3 with 11 (S1–S11) and 12 genome seg-
ments (S1–S12), respectively. While MyRV3 S8 is lost during subculturing of infected host
fungal strains, MyRV1 rearrangements undergo alterations spontaneously and inducibly.
The inducible MyRV1 rearrangements are different from any other previous examples of
reovirus rearrangements in their dependence on an unrelated virus factor, a multifunctional
protein, p29, encoded by a distinct virus Cryphonectria parasitica hypovirus 1 (CHV1). A total
of 5 MyRV1 variants with genome rearranged segments (S1–S3, S6 and S10) are generated
in the background of a single viral strain in the presence of CHV1 p29 supplied either trans-
genically or by coinfection. MyRV1 S4 and S10 are rearranged, albeit very infrequently, in a
CHV1 p29 independent fashion. A variant of MyRV1 with substantial deletions in both S4
and S10, generated through a combined reassortment and rearrangement approach, shows
comparable replication levels to the wild-type MyRV1. In vivo and in vitro interactions of
CHV1 p29 and MyRV1 VP9 are implicated in the induction of MyRV1 rearrangements. How-
ever, the mechanism underlying p29-mediated rearrangements remains largely unknown.
MyRV1 S4 rearrangements spontaneously occurred independently of CHV1 p29. In the
absence of reverse genetics systems for mycoreoviruses, molecular and biological char-
acterization of these MyRV1 and MyRV3 variants contribute to functional analyses of the
protein products encoded by those rearranged segments.

INTRODUCTION
The family Reoviridae accommodates a wide range of members
that infect protists, fungi, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates,
and are characterized by 9–12 segmented double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) genomes, multi-layered virion structures, and particle-
associated enzymes for RNA synthesis. The family now con-
sists of 15 genera divided into two subfamilies Spinareovirinae
(“turreted” or spiked reoviruses) and Sedoreovirinae (non-spiked
reoviruses) (Attoui et al., 2012). Among the 15 genera is a relatively
recently established genus Mycoreovirus containing three members
(Mycoreovirus 1–3, MyRV1-3) that were isolated in two phytopath-
ogenic fungi, speciﬁcally, the chestnut blight fungus (MyRV1 and
MyRV2) and the white root rot fungus (MyRV3) by the groups of
Drs. Bradley I. Hillman, William MacDonald, and Naoyuki Mat-
sumoto (Enebak et al., 1994; Hillman and Suzuki, 2004; Hillman
et al., 2004; Suzuki et al., 2004; Wei et al., 2004). MyRV1 and
MyRV2 have 11-segmented genomes (Figure 1; S1–S11, termed

with an increasing order of mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis), while MyRV3 has a 12-segmented genome (S1–
S12). The Mycoreovirus belongs to the Spinareovirinae subfamily
and its members retain conserved NTP binding motif and di-
histidine motif speciﬁcally conserved in the subfamily (Suzuki
et al., 2004; Supyani et al., 2007; Spear et al., 2012).

Like point mutations, rearrangements and reassortments are
major driving forces for reovirus genome molecular diversity
and evolution. Both could involve large extents of genome seg-
ment alterations, but they are different in the generation mech-
anism. Reassortment events, involving exchange of genome seg-
ments between two viruses, occur at varying rates during genome
packaging in coinfected cells. Genome rearrangements, deﬁned
as “alterations of considerable tracts of sequence within single
genome segments often in the form of deletions and extensions”
(Taniguchi and Urasawa, 1995), are a common phenomenon in
all major genera of the family Reoviridae (Table 1). They occur

reoviruses (Nuss, 1984). Rearrangements can be regarded as non-
homologous, intramolecular RNA recombination and exclude
intermolecular RNA recombinations that are documented fre-
quently in plus-sense (+), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses
but are infrequently reported for reoviruses (Taniguchi and Ura-
sawa, 1995; Desselberger, 1996). Rearrangements are hypothe-
sized to happen by copy choice (template switch) mechanism
during RNA synthesis mediated by the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) complex, as is RNA recombination in ssRNA
viruses.

In this review article we overview genome alterations, with a
focus on unusual genome rearrangements observed in mycore-
oviruses and discuss differences between other reovirus rearrange-
ments in type of genome segment alterations and possible mech-
anisms underlying their occurrence. Readers are referred to excel-
lent review articles on RNA recombination (Lai, 1992; Nagy and
Simon, 1997; Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011; Sztuba-Solinska
et al., 2011).

THREE TYPES OF UNUSUAL GENOME SEGMENT
ALTERATIONS IN THE GENUS MYCOREOVIRUS
Three types of very unusual genome alterations were reported to
occur in mycoreoviruses that differ from those reported for other
reoviruses. The ﬁrst example is complete loss of one of the seg-
ment S8 reported for MyRV3, a very rare event for a reovirus.
Reovirus genome segment sorting and assembly is tightly regu-
lated during virus replication. An entire set of genome segments
are believed to be incorporated and packaged into single core par-
ticles during replication (plus-sense strand synthesis). Therefore,
all reovirus strains with rearranged segments still contain a set
of all genome segments whether intact or altered. To our knowl-
edge, the MyRV3 strain reported by Kanematsu et al. (2004) is
the only example of reovirus that lacks a genome segment and is
still viable. These observations allowed the authors to conclude
that MyRV3 S8 is dispensable for maintenance under laboratory
conditions.

The second type of mutations found in MyRV1 is unique
among reovirus examples in their dependence on a distinct virus or
a viral protein. Speciﬁcally, MyRV1 rearrangements are observed at
extremely high rates in the fungal host either coinfected with the
prototype hypovirus Cryphonectria hypovirus 1/EP713 (CHV1-
EP713) or expressing a multifunctional protein p29 encoded by
CHV1-EP713 (Sun and Suzuki, 2008). After repeated subcultur-
ing of those fungal strains for one to two months, several dozen
percent of resulting MyRV1 isolates carry genome rearrange-
ments. From doubly infected fungal mycelia, a MyRV1 variant,
MyRV1/S10ss is isolated from 22.4% of subcultures, which har-
bors an altered segment S10ss, a deleted form of S10, in place
of an intact S10. S10ss lacks approximately 75% of the inter-
nal ORF region while retaining the 5’ and 3’ terminal regions
(Sun and Suzuki, 2008). In transformant fungal strains with the
CHV1 p29 coding domain, a variety of rearrangements are gen-
erated in addition to S10ss that include S1L, S2L, S3L, and S6L
(Figure 2). In contrast to S10ss, these rearranged segments involve
ORF extensions, but are distinct from many previously reported
animal reovirus examples. Extensions have been reported mostly
from rotaviruses and those entail all head-to-tail tandem partial

S1–S11. Each segment has a large single ORF corresponding between 42
and 98% of its entire size. Light gray boxes refer to ORFs and the sizes of
their protein products are shown. The locations and assigned functions of
encoded proteins are denoted below. RdRp, guanylyltransferase, and NTP
binding protein are assigned to S1, S3, and S6. VP4 and VP10 are
dispensable for replication, while they are required for normal symptom
induction. (B) Basic structure of the MyRV1 genome segment. The
plus-sense strand of each dsRNA segment possesses the strictly
conserved 5’ pentanucleotide (5’-GAUCA—), single ORF and 3’
heptanucleotide (—GCAGUCA-3’). (C) Electron microscopy of MyRV1

2008) and laboratory conditions, for example, by serial passage
of rotaviruses at high multiplicities of infection (MOIs; Hund-
ley et al., 1985; Kojima et al., 2000) and exclusive maintenance in
one of their two hosts (plant, vector insect) in the case of plant

to duplicated sequence while red color gradation is to indicate orientation
(head-to-tail for all rearrangements). In internal deletion mutations S4ss and
S10ss (E,F), only 11–22% (for S4ss) and 10–43% (for S10ss) of the intact
ORFs are retained. S4ss was generated spontaneously in a CHV1 p29
independent manner. Note that S4ss and S10ss each have at least 4
(S4ss1–S4ss4) and 2 variants (S10ss1 and 2) and one each of them (S4ss1
and S10ss1) are shown in (E) and (F), respectively. Solid lines denote the 5’
and 3’ UTRs, while blue and green boxes refer to the N and C terminal
portions of ORF retained after each rearrangement event. Nucleotide
positions for the start and stop codons, and rearrangement breakpoints are
shown above the diagrams of each normal segments. Nucleotide and aa
sequences adjacent to the altered sites on normal and rearranged
segments are also shown below the diagrams of each altered segment.
Neither sequence heterogeneity nor mismatch was detected at the
junction sites for S1L, S2L, and S3L, while mismatches are found at or
close to breakpoints of S4ss and S10ss (Sun and Suzuki, 2008;
Eusebio-Cope et al., 2010).

duplication occurring downstream of the termination codon of
the authentic ORF. Thus, unaltered protein products are being
synthesized from their cognate transcripts in infected cells. How-
ever, altered MyRV1 genome segments, i.e., S1L, S2L, S3L, and
S6L are all with duplicated ORFs in-frame with their preceding
ORFs, resulting in extension of ORFs by 1.4–1.9 fold. Impor-
tantly, the products of the expected sizes are detectable in mycelia
infected with MyRV1 variants although S1L-encoded product
remains to be detected (Sun and Suzuki, 2008; Tanaka et al., 2011).
These extended segments S1L, S2L, S3L, and S6L are frequently
concomitant with S10ss although its signiﬁcance is unclear. S1,
S3, and S6-encoded proteins carry sequence motifs characteris-
tic of RdRp (Hillman et al., 2004), guanylyltransferase (Supyani
et al., 2007), and NTP binding proteins (Suzuki et al., 2004).
It should be noted that these sequence motifs are duplicated
in the expected protein products. The capacity of core parti-
cles to encapsidate reovirus genomic segments is limited. The
maximum size expansion of an orthoreovirus was predicted to
be 10% of the entire size (approximately 2.0 kb) (Roner and
Steele, 2007). Congruent with this notion, MyRV1/S1L+ S10ss
variant, with the largest extension per segment (approximately
2.3 kb), has a genome-based extension of 1.8 kb after deduc-
tion of the deleted S10 sequence in S10ss. MyRV1/S6L extends
its entire genome-size by approximately 1.9 kb. These extensions
correspond to approximately an 8% increase on a genome-size
(23,433 bp) basis.

The third example is obtained through a combined reassort-
ment and rearrangement approach. MyRV1 S4 (Eusebio-Cope
et al., 2010) and S10 (Suzuki, unpublished results), albeit very
infrequently, are rearranged in a CHV1 p29 independent fashion.
MyRV1/S4ss variants carry deletion mutations on S4 (S4ss1, S4ss2,
S4ss3, and S4ss4) lacking approximately 80% of the S4 ORF but
retaining its ability to be transcribed and replicated. The genome
segments including S4ss, S4ss1–S4ss4 are different from each other
in deletion endpoint. A reassortant variant of MyRV1 that contains
substantial deletions in both S4 and S10 (MyRV1/S4ss1+ S10ss2)
was generated in fungal colonies coinfected with MyRV1/S4ss1 and
MyRV1/S10ss2. Surprisingly, MyRV1/S4ss+ S10ss shows compa-
rable replication levels to the wild-type MyRV1. This is the ﬁrst

FIGURE 2 | Schematic representation of the organization of MyRV1
rearranged segments. There are two types of MyRV1 rearrangements
reported: extensions (S1L, S2L, S3L, and S6L) and deletions (S4ss and

in-frame ORF fusion but S4ss and S10ss do not always involve in-frame
ORF deletions. Genetic organizations of the normal (top) and rearranged

Mycoreovirus genome alterations

example of a reovirus that is replication-competent without two
viral proteins.

IMPLICATIONS IN THE FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF MyRV1
GENOME SEGMENTS UNDERGOING REARRANGEMENTS
Unlike members of the genera Orthoreovirus (Kobayashi et al.,
2007), Orbivirus (Boyce et al., 2008; Matsuo et al., 2010), and
Rotavirus (Komoto et al., 2006), no reverse genetics system
has been developed for mycoreoviruses. However, the MyRV1
rearrangements (shown in Figure 2) provide insights into the
functional roles of the genome segments and their protein prod-
ucts. Common to all these altered rearrangements, they are com-
petent to be packaged and transcribed given the comparable
accumulation levels of their transcripts in infected cells. These
results show that signals for packaging, transcription, and replica-
tion reside within the remaining genome sequence. The viability of
MyRV1/S4ss+ S10ss indicates that neither MyRV1 non-structural
protein encoded by S4 (VP4) nor S10 (VP10) is required for virus
replication. Furthermore, Eusebio-Cope et al. (2010) reported
that VP4 contributes to mycelial growth and efﬁcient vertical
transmission through conidia. VP10 contributes inversely to the
reduction of aerial mycelial growth induced by the virus (Sun and
Suzuki, 2008). Recombination events altering protein sequences
are often deleterious to its function and puriﬁed from the popu-
lation (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011; Sztuba-Solinska et al.,
2011). In fact, most extensions reported previously for reoviruses
occur downstream of the termination codon and thus result in no
change of protein sequences (Kojima et al., 1996). In this sense,
the fact that several MyRV1 variants with extension rearrange-
ments are viable is surprising. Interpretation of functional roles for
extended segments (S1L, S2L, S3L, and S6L) in virus replication is
complex due to coexistence of the extended and normal unaltered
genome segments in fungal colonies infected by MyRV1 variants.
Therefore, heterocomplementation of rearranged segments by the
normal segments cannot be ruled out. In this regard, an interesting
observation was made by Tanaka et al. (2011), that fungal colonies
infected with MyRV1/S1L+ S10ss2, MyRV1/S2L+ S10ss2, and
MyRV1/S3L+ S10ss2 are similarly restored in aerial mycelial
growth to some extent (Figure 3). The restoration levels of aer-
ial mycelial growth increase as the ratio of transcript levels of
rearranged S1L to normal segment S1 rises (Tanaka et al., 2011).
As in other reoviruses, rearrangements are considered to con-
tribute to evolution and molecular diversity of mycoreoviruses,
while mycoreoviruses with such rearrangements including the
MyRV3 S8 loss are found under laboratory conditions, but not
in the natural environment. MyRV1 variants with large deletions
may have selective advantages in replication or packaging over
wild-type MyRV1. MyRV1 variants with large extensions require
CHV1 p29 for their maintenance, suggesting no selective advan-
tage of these variants in the absence of p29. Maintenance of
animal viruses in cultured host cells frequently induces muta-
tions that confer selective advantages under laboratory conditions
and lead to virulence attenuation in host animals. In this regard,
MyRV1 with genome rearrangements are different because they
retain the ability to induce symptoms, while distinct from those
induced by wild-type MyRV1 (Figure 3), including the reduction
of host virulence to plants. Rather, MyRV1 is reminiscent of plant

wild-type MyRV1 (MyRV1), MyRV1/S10ss2 (MyRV1/S10ss), MyRV1/S1L +
S10ss2 (MyRV1/S1L + S10ss), MyRV1/S2L + S10ss2 (MyRV1/S2L +
S10ss), or MyRV1/S3L + S10ss2 (MyRV1/S3L + S10ss). Virus-free EP155

reoviruses which undergo various mutations when they are main-
tained exclusively in one of their hosts, plant and insect vectors
in laboratory conditions. Examples include those of would tumor
virus (WTV) and rice dwarf virus (RDV) that are vectored by
different species of leafhoppers (Table 1). In fact, transmission
defective isolates of WTV emerge after being maintained for a
long period of time in cultured insect cells that carry internal dele-
tions on segments encoding structural and non-structural proteins
(Nuss, 1984; Anzola et al., 1987). In the case of RDV maintained
only in plants, point mutations rather than internal deletions accu-
mulate resulting in little expression of protein products encoded by
the mutated segments. Consequently, such isolates dominate the
virus population. However, one single passage in cultured insect
vector cell lines resulted in inverse population structures (Pu et al.,
2011).

MECHANISMS OF GENERAL RNA RECOMBINATION AND
REOVIRUS REARRANGEMENTS
Rearrangements are a type of RNA recombination. Two major
mechanisms are proposed for it, speciﬁcally, replication indepen-
dent breakage-rejoining recombination, and replication depen-
dent RdRp-mediated recombination (template switch or copy
choice). The non-replicative, breaking-joining mechanism entails
dsRNA or ssRNA fragmentation and re-ligation for which several
variations are proposed such as self-recombination requiring no
proteins, and RNase-catalyzed cleavage and ligation (Chetverin,
1999). The second model, replicase-mediated mechanism is more
widely accepted (Lai, 1992; Nagy and Simon, 1997; Sztuba-
Solinska et al., 2011). In this model, the nascent RNA and RdRp
complex jumps after proceeding to a certain point from one

Mycoreovirus genome alterations

template to another (intergenic or intermolecular recombina-
tion) or to another point of the same template (intragenic or
intramolecular recombination). Template switches could occur in
homologous and non-homologous (illegitimate) manners such
that their crossover regions are of similar and unrelated sequences
respectively. Replicative non-homologous recombination is some-
times considered to be facilitated by sequences features of template
and acceptor strands, such as direct, inverted repeats and/or sec-
ondary structures. A number of viral RNA and protein elements
as well as host factors are involved in RNA recombinations in dif-
ferent single-stranded, plus-sense RNA plant virus/host systems
(Serviene et al., 2005; Sztuba-Solinska et al., 2011). Recently, RNA
silencing was shown to contribute to the generation of defective-
interfering (DI) RNAs of the prototype hypovirus (CHV1; Zhang
and Nuss, 2008), associated with the picornavirus superfamily
(Koonin et al., 1991), that infects the chestnut blight fungus and
confers hypovirulence.

Rearrangements reported for members of the family Reoviridae
could be accounted for by an intramolecular template switch,
in which the replicase complex jumps backward (for extension)
or forward (for deletions) on the same template molecule. For
example, intragenic rearrangements of human rotavirus segment
S11 are hypothesized to be generated in the process of plus-sense
strand synthesis (transcription) mediated by short direct repeats of
4–6 nucleotides (Kojima et al., 1996; Schnepf et al., 2008; Table 1).
Gault et al. (2001) inferred that duplications of human rotavirus
genes 7 and 11 were presumed to occur by template switch medi-
ated by an inverted repeat-involving secondary structure during
the replication step (Gault et al., 2001; Table 1). A rare exam-
ple is intergenic recombination with a crossover of two rotavirus
segments encoding NSP2 and NSP5,6 (Cao et al., 2008; Table 1).
Recent structural studies led to 3D modeling of RdRps from two
reoviruses, human orthoreovirus and rotavirus. They are com-
monly characterized by 4-window structures which allow entry
of substrates (rear window) and templates (left window), and
exit of template RNA (front window) and nascent RNA (bottom
window; Tao et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2008; Guglielmi et al., 2010).
Based on this RdRp structural prediction, a loop model was pro-
posed to explain how reovirus extension rearrangements occur
(Matthijnssens et al., 2006). According to this model, extension
rearrangements occur during the transcription step via intramol-
ecular template switch from the transcribed region of the minus-
strand to upstream regions of the same molecule re-entering from
the left channel. It remains unknown how the mechanism of inter-
genic recombination or large deletion rearrangements ﬁts into the
RdRp 3D model.

IMPLICATION IN THE MECHANISM OF CHV1 P29-MEDIATED
GENERATION OF MyRV1 REARRANGEMENTS
Addressing how p29 is involved in the enhanced emergence of
MyRV1 rearrangements is an interesting challenge. Before dis-
cussing this issue, replication of hypoviruses and reoviruses should
be brieﬂy explained. Hypovirus RNA are replicated in Golgi-
derived vesicles of ∼80 nm whose production is enhanced in the
cytoplasm upon viral infection (Fahima et al., 1994; Hillman and
Suzuki, 2004; Jacob-Wilk et al., 2006). Reovirus RNAs are synthe-
sized in viroplasms or virus factories formed in the cytoplasm of

infected cells by viral and host components (Patton et al., 2006;
Cheung et al., 2010). CHV1 p29 is a multifunctional protein act-
ing as a symptom determinant (Choi and Nuss, 1992; Craven et al.,
1993; Suzuki et al., 1999, 2003), protease (Choi et al., 1991a,b), an
RNA silencing suppressor (Segers et al., 2006), and an enhancer
of heterologous and homologous viruses (Suzuki et al., 2003; Sun
et al., 2006). Some functional domains of p29 are mapped such as
the N terminal aa 1–24 essential for virus viability, adjacent 25–74
for the symptom determinant and the C terminal half for the pro-
teolytic catalytic domain (Suzuki and Nuss, 2002; Hillman et al.,
2004).

Two possibilities are proposed to account for the p29-mediated
generation of MyRV1 rearrangements. Firstly, p29 may interact
the RNA synthesis machinery to perturb transcription (plus-sense
RNA synthesis) and/or replication (minus-sense RNA synthesis),
leading to enhanced rate of template switch of RdRp-mediated
via RNA sequence features such as inverted or direct repeats.
Another possibility is that p29 alters the physiological state of
infected cells, which enhances selection of pre-existing mutant
viruses with rearranged segments by unknown means. These
two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Regarding the ﬁrst
possibility, it remains unknown whether CHV1 p29 reside in
MyRV1 core particles viewed as a nano-scale RNA synthesis fac-
tory (Guglielmi et al., 2010) to perturb MyRV1 RNA synthesis.
Sun and Suzuki (2008) showed that CHV1 p29 interacts with
MyRV1 VP9, considered to be a non-structural protein, in vitro
and in vivo, providing a clue to the mechanism. As in cells infected
with other reoviruses, viroplasm is produced in MyRV1-infected
cells (Sun and Suzuki, unpublished data). One or two viral non-
structural proteins are required as matrix proteins for production
of reoviral viroplasms which are believed to be the site of virus
replication where core particle assembly and RNA synthesis occur.
Consistent with this notion, knocking-down of the genes respon-
sible for functional viroplasm formation is detrimental for virus
replication (Campagna et al., 2007; Shimizu et al., 2009, 2011).
As discussed above, a MyRV1 variant shows comparable repli-
cation competency without VP4 and VP10. Therefore, VP4 and
VP10 are unlikely to be matrix proteins of viroplasms given the
essentiality of viroplasm. One of key points to be addressed is
what the possible role of VP9 in MyRV1 replication is. It is
of interest to infer that VP9 is a viroplasm matrix protein that
is remodeled upon interaction with p29. Moreover, to explore
whether CHV1 p29 is incorporated into MyRV1 core particles
is a prerequisite.

The other possibility may be associated with the reason why
almost a half of the MyRV1 segments, whether encoding structural
or non-structural proteins, are generated at high rates. CHV1 p29,
as a symptom determinant, slightly enhances mycelial growth and
suppresses asexual sporulation and orange pigmentation, which
involve complex regulatory pathways. Additionally, p29 is an RNA
silencing suppressor which may potentially be able to perturb the
cellular physiological state. The p29 protein might be involved
in selection and maintenance of MyRV1 variants with rearrange-
ments. Apparent“reversion”of S1L, S2L, S3L, and S6L to respective
normal segments (Sun and Suzuki, 2008; Tanaka et al., 2011) in the
absence of p29 suggests a role for the protein in the maintenance
of the extended segments.

Mycoreovirus genome alterations

CONCLUSION
Three unusual types of genome alterations are found in the
genus Mycoreovirus; a S8-deﬁcient MyRV3 mutant, a MyRV1
variant with two rearranged segments (S4ss and S10ss) each
lacking three fourths of the ORF, and MyRV1 variants with
genome rearrangements (S1L, S2L, S3L, S6L, and S10ss) induced
by a multifunctional protein p29 of an unrelated virus, CHV1.
While S8-lacking MyRV3 strains have properties indistinguishable
from wild-type MyRV3, most MyRV1 variants with rearranged
segments induced different symptoms in the chestnut blight
fungus than the wild-type virus. Therefore, these genome seg-
ment alterations are useful for gaining insights into functional
roles of genome segments of mycoreoviruses for which a reverse
genetics system is unavailable like many other Reoviridae mem-
bers. The CHV1 p29-dependent rearrangements of MyRV1 are
a novel type of intriguing virus/virus interactions, and accord-
ingly there are a few important unanswered questions. What

is the biological signiﬁcance of the interactions between the
two viruses? Do either of the viruses beneﬁt from the interac-
tions? What function of CHV1 p29 is related to rearrangements?
Does p29 contribute to generate de novo genome rearrange-
ments or to select pre-existing rearrangements by altering the
cellular state, while it is poorly deﬁned at present? Does CHV1
p29 induce genome rearrangements on other reoviruses such
as MyRV2 and MyRV3? Experiments to address these issues are
underway.
