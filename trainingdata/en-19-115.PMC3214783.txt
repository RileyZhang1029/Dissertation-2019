ABSTRACT

New  genetic  and  environmental  studies  of  Parkinson’s  disease  have  revealed  early 
problems  in  synaptic  function  and  connectivity  indicating  that  axonal  impairment  may 
be  an  important  hallmark  in  this  disorder.  Since  many  studies  suggest  that  axonal 
dysfunction  precedes  cell  body  loss,  it  is  critical  to  target  axons  with  treatments  aimed 
at  preserving  “connectivity”  as  well  as  to  develop  and  verify  “biomarkers”  with  which  to 
assess  disease  progression  and  drug  efficacy.

Key  words:  axon  transport,  mitochondria,  Wallerian  degeneration,  MPTP

    Parkinson’s  disease  (PD)  is  a  common  neuro-
degenerative  disorder  with  at 
least  one  million 
people  in  the  United  States  and  six  million  world-
wide  being  affected.  The  clinical  symptoms  of  PD, 
tremor,  rigidity  and  bradykinesia,  primarily  arise 
from  the  loss  of  dopaminergic  cells  in  the  sub-
stantia  nigra  pars  compacta.  Characteristic  path-
ological  changes  include  decreased  mitochondrial 
complex  I  activity  and  increased  indices  of  oxidative 
stress  as  well  as  the  presence  of  intracellular  and 
axonal  deposits  called  Lewy  bodies  and  Lewy 
neurites,  respectively  (Samii  et  al.,  2004).  Although 
the  etiology  of  PD  remains  unknown,  both  genetic 
and  environmental  factors  appear  to  play  a  role. 
A  number  of  genes  associated  with  familial  PD 
have  been  identified  (e.g.  a-synuclein,  parkin,  DJ-1, 
PINK1,  LRRK2,  UCHL1,  ATP13A2)  demonstrating 
that  molecular  mechanisms  underlying  PD  are  com-
plex  and  likely  to  be  heterogeneous  (Schapira  et 
al.,  2009;  Westerlund  et  al.,  2010).  In  addition,

1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine  (MPTP)  or  its  active  de-
rivative,  MPP＋,  results  in  a  disorder  that  mimics 
many  aspects  of  this  disease  (Westerlund  et  al., 
2010).
    Most  knowledge  about  the  molecular  mechanisms 
underlying  PD  has  come  from  postmortem  tissue 
studies  as  well  as  the  genetic  associations  and 
environmental 
the  disorder 
(Schapira  et  al.,  2009;  Westerlund  et  al.,  2010).  In 
general,  these  studies  support  the  view  that  in  PD, 
dopaminergic  neurons  die  via  programmed  cell 
death  or  apoptosis.  Thus 
therapeutic  strategies 
aimed  at  halting  the  underlying  causes  of  cell  loss 
in  PD  have  targeted  apoptotic  pathways  with  some 
success,  at  least  in  animal  models.  Unfortunately, 
there  is  little  clinical  evidence  to  show  that  blocking 
cell  death  is  neuroprotective  (Waldmeier  et  al., 
2006).  These  results  underscore  the  need  for  bro-
adening 
the  models  of  PD  pathogenesis.  Fur-
thermore,  it  is  increasingly  apparent  that  preserving 
critical  circuits  can  only  be  achieved  by  “staying 
connected”.   
    Recently,  ultrastructural,  physiological,  and  gene-
tic  studies  have  revealed  early  abnormalities  in

synaptic  function  and  connectivity  in  PD.  Thus, 
mounting  evidence  indicates  that  axonal  dysfunction 
may  be  an  important  hallmark  in  PD,  one  that 
unifies  the  many  disparate  models  (Hilliard,  2009; 
Morfini  et  al.,  2009). 
    How  does  impaired  axonal  transport  lead  to  axon 
pathology?  Neurons  are  the  most  highly  polarized 
of  vertebrate  cells  with  axons  extending  up  to 
10,000  times  the  width  of  their  cell  bodies.  Thus, 
neurons  depend  upon  efficient  transport  systems  to 
get  “cargos”  (proteins,  vesicles,  and  other  organe-
lles)  where  they  need  to  go.  Cargos  move  along 
tracks  of  microtubules  with  the  help  of  specialized 
proteins.  For  instance,  cargos  are  transported  in  the 
anterograde  direction  by  kinesin  motor  proteins 
while  cargos  returning  to  the  cell  body  are  largely 
transported  by  dynein  motors  (Cai  and  Sheng, 
2009).  When  either  process  is  disrupted,  cargos 
can  accumulate  leading  to  protein  aggregation,  the 
sequestration  of  cellular 
factors  and  organelles, 
activation  of  cell  stress  signaling  cascades,  dis-
ruption  of  the  tracks  themselves  and  ultimately, 
axonal  degeneration.  Defective  axonal  transport  will 
also 
loss  of  new  material  and/or 
vesicles  at  the  distal  axon,  the  loss  of  neurotropic 
signaling,  the  failure  to  degrade  defective  proteins 
and  potentially  the  activation  of  programmed  cell 
death  pathways.  Finally,  even  very  subtle  changes 
in  axon  transport  may  lead  to  the  re-distribution  of 
important  organelles  such  as  mitochondria  with  an 
ensuing  loss  of  energy  and  consequently  disruption 
of  energy-driven  processes  such  as  synaptic  func-

the  evidence 

in  PD?  First, 

from 
the  disorder  suggesting 

tion,  movement  of  other  cargoes,  etc.  (Cai  and 
Sheng,  2009).  A  model  of  some  of  these  key 
features  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.   
that  defective  axonal 
    What 
is 
transport  plays  a  role 
the  earliest 
widespread  axonal  pathology 
stages  of 
that  axonal 
function  is  impaired  (Braak  et  al.,  2004).  Moreover, 
in  patient,  non-human  primate  and  animal  models 
of  PD,  the  loss  of  axons  appears  to  precede  the 
loss  of  cell  bodies  (Dauer  and  Przedborski,  2003). 
For  example,  the  onset  of  symptoms  in  patients 
appears  after  most  of  the  axonal  dopamine  in  the 
striatum  has  been  depleted  (70∼80%)  and  about 
half  of  the  nigral  dopamine-producing  cells  have 
died  (Bernheimer  et  al.,  1973).  Also,  the  appear-
ance  of  α-synuclein-positive  Lewy  neurites  almost 
always  precedes  that  of  Lewy  Bodies  (Braak  et  al., 
2004;  Orimo  et  al.,  2008).  These  observations  have 
led 
that  nigral  neurons  de-
generate  through  a  “dying  back”  axonopathy  in 
which  degeneration  begins  in  the  distal  axon  and 
proceeds  over  weeks  or  months  towards  the  cell 
body  (Raff  et  al.,  2002).
    Second,  mutations  in  the  PD-linked  Leucine-Rich 
Repeat  Kinase  2  (LRRK2)  gene,  which  represent 
the  most  common  genetic  cause  for  familial  (6%) 
and  idiopathic  (1∼2%)  PD  is  also  associated  with 
aggregated  axonal  α-synuclein  as  well  as  with  tau 
pathology  (Ballatore  et  al.,  2007).  Knockdown  of 
LRRK2  or  introduction  of  “kinase-dead”  constructs 
leads  to  long,  highly  branched  neuritic  processes

features  of  PD 

whereas  constructs  with  increased  kinase  activity 
exhibit  very  short  simple  processes  in  neuronal 
cultures  or  transduced  nigrostriatal  models  (Mac-
Leod  et  al.,  2006).  Moreover,  transgenic  mice  ex-
pressing  the  PD-linked  mutation  LRRK2  (R1441G) 
recapitulate  key 
including 
motoric,  neurochemical  and  pathological  features  (Li 
et  al.,  2009).  Importantly,  these  animals  exhibit  an 
early,  progressive  decline  in  dopaminergic  terminal 
fields  with  a  more  than  8-fold  increase  in  dystrophic 
processes  and  abnormal  axonal  swellings  (Li  et  al., 
2009).  Thus,  these  data  also  support  the  idea  that 
impaired  axonal  transport  plays  an  early,  pivotal 
role  in  LRRK2-associated  PD. 
    Third,  α-synuclein-positive  Lewy  neurites  precede 
Lewy  bodies  in  the  brain  (Braak  et  al.,  2004)  as 
well  as  in  the  cardiac  sympathetic  nervous  system 
(Orimo  et  al.,  2008).  Specifically  α-synuclein  ag-
gregates  appear  first  in  distal  axons  then  as  these 
regress,  aggregates  accumulate  in  more  proximal 
axons  and  subsequently  cell  bodies  (Braak  et  al., 
2004;  Orimo  et  al.,  2008).  Conceivably,  this  early 
chronology  mirrors 
the  pathological  mechanism 
associated  with  PD.  Additionally,  α-synuclein  mu-
tants.  accumulate  in  the  cell  soma  when  over-
expressed  in  cortical  neurons,  suggesting  reduced 
axonal  transport  as  well  (Saha  et  al.,  2004).  Recent 
studies  examining  protein  domains  associated  with 
transport  indicate  that  those  regions  involved  in 
membrane  binding  decreased  the  number  of  α
-synuclein  particles  present 
in  hippocampal  sy-
napses  (Yang  et  al.,  2010).  Authors  speculate  that 
α-synuclein  might  function  as  a  scaffolding  protein 
linking  membranous  cargoes  with  microtubule-de-
pendent  axonal  transport  (Yang  et  al.,  2010) 
    Fourth,  genetic  mutations  in  the  PD-linked  genes, 
Parkin,  an  E3  ligase,  and  PINK1  (PTEN-induced 
putative  kinase  1  protein)  a  mitochondrially-targeted 
kinase,  have  been  shown  to  regulate  mitochondrial 
fission/fusion  machinery  and  alter  axonal  transport 
(Lu,  2009;  Bueler,  2010).  For  example,  mitochon-
dria  are  not  only  transported  up  and  down  the  axon 
they  also  undergo  dynamic  interconversion  events 
in  which  two  mitochondria  fuse  to  form  a  long 
tubular  structure  (fusion)  or  a  single  mitochondria 
splits  in  two  (fission).  Fusion/fission  processes  are 
thought  to  be  intimately  involved  in  mitochondrial 
transport  since  1)  mutations  associated  with  Drp1,  a

the  key  mitochondrial 

fusion  promoting  gene,  impair  axonal  transport  (Lu, 
2009);  2)  fused,  elongated  mitochondria  are  less 
mobile  then  short,  vesicular  structures  (Cai  and 
Sheng,  2009);  and  3)  fission  generates  healthy 
mitochondria  that  are  transported  down  the  axon 
whereas  damaged,  dysfunctional  mitochondria  are 
sent  back  to  the  cell  body  for  repair  by  fusion  or 
degraded  via  mitophagy  (Miller  and  Sheetz,  2005). 
Very  recent  data  indicate  that  PINK  1  is  selectively 
stabilized  on  depolarized  mitochondrial  membranes. 
This  in  turn  acts  as  a  signal  for  Parkin  recruitment 
which  tags  Pink-positive,  depolarized  mitochondria 
for  destruction  via  autophagy  (i.e.  mitophagy;  Na-
form  a 
rendra  et  al.,  2010).  PINK1  can  also 
complex  with 
transport 
proteins,  Miro  and  Milton  (Weihofen  et  al.,  2009). 
Taken  together  these  data  suggest  that  PINK1/ 
Parkin  PD-linked  mutations  lead  to  impaired  mito-
chondrial  dynamics  resulting  in  altered  transport, 
distribution  and  loss  of  synaptic  function.   
    Fifth,  environmental  toxins  known  to  mimic  PD 
such  as  rotenone  and  MPTP  or  MPP
,  not  only 
inhibit  mitochondrial  Complex  I  activity,  but  also  de- 
polymerize  microtubules  which  take  on  a  beaded, 
broken  appearance  leading  to  axon  fragmentation 
(Cappelletti  et  al.,  2005;  Ren  et  al.,  2005).  This 
might  be  due  to  a  direct  interaction  or  indirectly  as 
a  consequence  of  Complex  I  inhibition  resulting  in 
the  loss  of  ATP  and  increased  oxidative  stress 
(Cappelletti  et  al.,  2005;  Ren  et  al.,  2005).  In  either 
case,  loss  of  microtubule  integrity  would  clearly  lead 
to  axonal  degeneration  (Fig.  1). 
    Sixth,  recent  data  suggest  that  the  Wallerian 
degeneration  slow  fusion  protein  (WldS)  can  delay 
axonal  degeneration  about  10-fold  from  a  wide 
variety  of  genetic  and  toxin-inducing  stimuli  in  vivo 
and  in  vitro.  WldS  is  a  chimeric  protein  composed  of 
the  N-terminal  70  amino  acids  of  the  ubiquitination 
factor  Ube4b  followed  by  a  18  amino  acid  linker 
region  and  the  entire  sequence  of  Nmnat1,  a  key 
enzyme  in  the  biosynthesis  of  NAD＋  (Mack  et  al., 
2001).  Most  studies  suggest  that  catalytically  active 
Nmnat1  is  necessary  for  axonal  protection  although 
it  is  unclear  whether  increased  NAD＋  is  responsible 
(Sasaki  et  al.,  2009).  Despite  WldS  being  primarily 
localized

studies  have  found  substantial  amounts  of  WldS

hance  ATP  synthesis  (Yahata  et  al.,  2009),  prevent 
free  radical  formation  (Press  and  Milbrandt,  2009), 
or  maintain  mitochondrial  membrane  potential  (Ike-
gami  and  Koike,  2003).  Data  from  this  lab  has 
shown  that  in  the  mouse  MPTP  model,  the  WldS 
gene  product  enhances  survival,  prevents  nigro-
striatal  axon  degeneration,  and  attenuates  neuro-
transmitter  loss  but  does  not  rescue  cell  bodies 
(Hasbani  and  O’Malley,  2006).  Despite  this  striking 
field  preservation,  how  WldS  prevents 
terminal 
axonal  dysfunction  is  unknown  but  may  be  related 
to  its  effects  on  mitochondrial  function. 
    Finally  results  using  the  isolated  squid  axoplasm 
model  support  the  notion  that  MPP＋  directly  inhibits 
fast  axonal  transport  independent  of  mitochondria 
＋
effects  (Morfini  et  al.,  2009).  Specifically,  MPP
 
increases  retrograde  trafficking  of  organelles  in  a 
PKCδ,  caspase  3-dependent  process.  This  in  turn 
leads  to  a  loss  of  appropriate  neurotransmission 
and  failure  to  generate  post  synaptic  responses 
(Morfini  et  al.,  2009).  Taken  together,  these  data 
＋
provide  direct  evidence  that  the  PD-mimetic,  MPP
 
rapidly  affects  critical  axonal  processes.  Moreover, 
using  compartmented  chambers  and  dopaminergic 
neurons  derived  from  genetically  altered  animals 
expressing  targeted  GFP,  we  have  been  able  to 
show  that,  like  the  squid  giant  axon,  MPP
  affects 
axonal  trafficking  (Unpublished  results). 
    Taken  together,  results  from  both  environmental 
and  genetic  factors  linked  to  PD  support  an  early, 
critical  role  for  axonal  impairment  in  this  disorder. 
Therefore,  it  is  critical  to  target  new  drugs  to  axons 
in  order  to  preserve  “connectivity”.  At  the  very  least, 
efforts  to  delay  axonal  dysfunction  may  push  back 
the  disease  clock  allowing  those  afflicted  to  main-
tain  an  improved  quality  of  life.  Ultimately,  thera-
peutics  targeted  towards  both  the  axon  and  the  cell 
body  may  provide  the  most  efficacious  treatment  of 
all.
