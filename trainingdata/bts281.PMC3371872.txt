28 ISMB 2012, page i1 doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts281  Editorial  This special issue comprises the papers accepted for presentation at the 20th Annual International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, an ofﬁcial conference of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB  http://www.iscb.org).
ISMB 2012 (http://www.iscb.org/ismb2012/) will take place in Long Beach, California, USA, from July 15 17, 2012  preceded during July 13 14 by eleven 1 or 2 day Special Interest Group (SIG) meetings, two satellite meetings and two half-day tutorials.
The 35 papers in this volume were selected from 268 submitted papers.
Submitted papers were assigned to 13 areas.
Area Chairs led each topic area by selecting their area s program committee and overseeing the reviewing process.
Many area chairs were new compared with 2011.
Fourteen papers for which area chairs were in conﬂict were reviewed under a  Conﬂicts Management  section headed by the Proceedings Chair  ﬁve such papers were accepted.
Areas, co-chairs and acceptance information are listed in Table 1.
Compared with prior years, ﬁve mature topic areas had steady submissions,  Evolution and Comparative Genomics ,  Gene Regulation and Transcriptomics ,  Protein Structure and Function ,  Protein Interactions and Networks  and  Sequence Analysis .
The latter s rose by 30% with many strong submissions.
Two areas newer to ISMB had a good showing this year,  Bioimaging  and  Disease Models and Epidemiology .
One area more than doubled,  Disease Models , partly as a result of taking some of  Population Genomics  load  and one quadrupled,  Bioimaging .
Databases and Ontologies ,  Massspec  and  Text Mining  each received roughly six submissions.
Across the areas, 224 members of the bioinformatics community provided reviews.
Most papers received three reviews and several received four or more.
There was signiﬁcant discussion of the merits of the papers ﬁrst between referees and the area chairs, and then between area chairs and the proceedings chair.
Initial decisions to accept papers were made during a comprehensive conference call with the area chairs, and several papers underwent a further evaluation by additional area chairs before acceptance decisions  Table 1.
Areas, co-chairs and acceptance information  Topic area  Area co-chair  in several cases reviewers  were ﬁnalized.
We appreciate that opinions might have changed with additional input or further clariﬁcations from the authors  because the ISMB 2012 timeline did not allow for a second round of reviews, however, only papers where referees suggested minor revisions could be accepted.
For several papers where referee comments might have been unclear to the authors, area chairs added additional comments and explanations.
In total, 36 papers were conditionally accepted, pending revision.
After acceptance notices were sent, the authors had two weeks to modify their papers according to the suggestions made by the reviewers and to respond to reviewers  comments.
Modiﬁed papers and authors  responses were re-examined during the next week to ensure each paper was modiﬁed appropriately in response to the reviewers  comments.
We were pleased that 35 conditionally accepted papers were ﬁnally accepted for the conference.
The ﬁnal acceptance rate was 13%, signiﬁcantly lower than rates of 20 and 19% in the two prior years, based on the decision to accept fewer proceedings papers.
Collectively, the 35 accepted papers had 133 authors from 12 countries across 5 continents, with 89 authors from North America, 25 from Europe, 7 from Asia, 2 from Israel and 10 from Australia.
We thank the area chairs and reviewers for their hard work and dedication to maintaining a professional review process.
We thank all authors of submitted papers and authors of accepted papers for their diligences in responding to reviewer comments within two weeks.
We thank Steven Leard s team for extensive technical support with the EasyChair submission and reviewing system  Mona Singh, Joel S. Bader, Terry Gaasterland and Martin Vingron for sharing their experiences from prior years  the team at Oxford University Press for type-setting the papers  Conference Chairs, Terry Gaasterland, Richard H. Lathrop, Burkhard Rost and Sydney Brenner (Honorary Chair), as well as the ISMB 2012 Steering Committee, for their valuable input  and Steven Leard for helping us oversee the process.
