Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes not only intrahepatic diseases but also extrahepatic
manifestations, including metabolic disorders. Chronic HCV infection is often associated
with type 2 diabetes. However, the precise mechanism underlying this association is still
unclear. Glucose is transported into hepatocytes via glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). Hepato-
cytes play a crucial role in maintaining plasma glucose homeostasis via the gluconeogenic
and glycolytic pathways. We have been investigating the molecular mechanism of HCV-
related type 2 diabetes using HCV RNA replicon cells and HCV J6/JFH1 system. We found
that HCV replication down-regulates cell surface expression of GLUT2 at the transcrip-
tional level. We also found that HCV infection promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis in HCV
J6/JFH1-infected Huh-7.5 cells. HCV infection transcriptionally up-regulated the genes for
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase), the
rate-limiting enzymes for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Gene expression of PEPCK and G6Pase
was regulated by the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) in HCV-infected cells.
Phosphorylation of FoxO1 at Ser319 was markedly diminished in HCV-infected cells, result-
ing in increased nuclear accumulation of FoxO1. HCV NS5A protein was directly linked with
the FoxO1-dependent increased gluconeogenesis.This paper will discuss the current model
of HCV-induced glucose metabolic disorders.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-sense, single stranded RNA
virus that belongs to the genus Hepacivirus of the family Flaviviri-
dae. The approximately 9.6-kb HCV genome encodes a unique
open reading frame that is translated into a polyprotein of about
3,000 amino acids, which is cleaved by cellular signalases and viral
proteases to generate at least 10 viral proteins, such as core, enve-
lope 1 (E1) and E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B
(Choo et al., 1991; Lemon et al., 2007).

Hepatitis C virus is the main cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cir-
rhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. More than 170 million peo-
ple worldwide are chronically infected with HCV (Poynard et al.,
2003). Persistent HCV infection causes not only liver diseases but
also extrahepatic manifestations. It is well established that HCV
perturbs the glucose metabolism, leading to insulin resistance and
type 2 diabetes in predisposed individuals. Several epidemiologi-
cal, clinical, and experimental data suggested that HCV infection
serves as an additional risk factor for the development of dia-
betes (Mason et al., 1999; Negro and Alaei, 2009; Negro, 2011).
HCV-related glucose metabolic changes and insulin resistance and
diabetes have signiﬁcant clinical consequences, such as accelerated
ﬁbrogenesis, increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and
reduced virological response to interferon (IFN)-α-based therapy
(Negro, 2011). Therefore, it is very important to clarify the mol-
ecular mechanism of HCV-related diabetes. However, the precise
mechanisms are poorly understood.

Experimental data suggest a direct interference of HCV with
the insulin signaling pathway. Transgenic mice expressing HCV

core gene exhibit insulin resistance (Shintani et al., 2004; Koike,
2007). In this transgenic mice model, both tyrosine phospho-
rylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 are
decreased. These decreases are recovered when the proteasome
activator PA28γ is deleted, suggesting that the HCV core protein
suppresses insulin signaling through a PA28γ-dependent pathway
(Miyamoto et al., 2007). Several other reports also showed a link
of the HCV core protein with insulin resistance (Kawaguchi et al.,
2004; Pazienza et al., 2007).

Hepatocytes play a crucial role in maintaining plasma glucose
homeostasis by adjusting the balance between hepatic glucose
production and utilization via the gluconeogenic and glycolytic
pathways, respectively. Gluconeogenesis is mainly regulated at the
transcriptional level of the glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) genes, whereas gly-
colysis is mainly regulated by glucokinase (GK). Gluconeogenesis
and glycolysis are coordinated so that one pathway is highly active
within a cell while the other is relatively inactive. It is well known
that increased hepatic glucose production via gluconeogenesis is a
major feature of type 2 diabetes (Clore et al., 2000).

To identify a novel mechanism of HCV-related diabetes, we
have been investigating the effects of HCV on glucose produc-
tion in hepatocytes using HCV RNA replicon cells (Lohmann
et al., 1999) and HCV J6/JFH1 cell culture system (Lindenbach
et al., 2005; Wakita et al., 2005; Bungyoku et al., 2009). We pre-
viously reported that HCV replication suppresses cellular glucose
uptake through down-regulation of cell surface expression of glu-
cose transporter 2 (GLUT2; Kasai et al., 2009). Furthermore, we

recently reported that HCV promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis via
an NS5A-mediated, forkhead box O1 (FoxO1)-dependent path-
way, resulting in increased cellular glucose production in hepato-
cytes (Deng et al., 2011). This paper discusses our current model
for HCV-induced glucose metabolic disorders.

HCV REPLICATION DOWN-REGULATES CELL SURFACE
EXPRESSION OF GLUT2
The uptake of glucose into cells is conducted by the facilitative
glucose carrier, glucose transporters (GLUTs). GLUTs are inte-
gral membrane proteins that contain 12 membrane-spanning
helices. To date, a total of 14 isoforms have been identiﬁed in the
GLUT family (Wu and Freeze, 2002; Macheda et al., 2005; Godoy
et al., 2006). Glucose is transported into hepatocytes by GLUT2.
We previously reported that HCV J6/JFH1 infection suppresses
hepatocytic glucose uptake through down-regulation of surface
expression of GLUT2 in human hepatoma cell line, Huh-7.5 cells
(Kasai et al., 2009). We also demonstrated that GLUT2 expres-
sion in hepatocytes of the liver tissues from HCV-infected patients
was signiﬁcantly lower than in those from patients without HCV
infection. Our data suggest that HCV infection down-regulates
GLUT2 expression at transcriptional level. We are currently ana-
lyzing transcriptional control of human GLUT2 promoter in HCV
replicon cells as well as in HCV J6/JFH1-infected cells.

gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Therefore, we examined whether
HCV infection induces gluconeogenesis or glycolysis. We found
that the PEPCK and G6Pase genes were transcriptionally up-
regulated in J6/JFH1-infected cells (Figure 1). On the other
hand, the GK gene was transcriptionally down-regulated in HCV-
infected cells. We obtained similar data in HCV replicon cells (both
in subgenomic replicon cells and full-genomic replicon cells).
When HCV replication was suppressed by IFN treatment, the
up-regulation of PEPCK and G6Pase gene expression as well as
the down-regulation of GK gene expression were canceled. From
these results, HCV infection selectively up-regulates PEPCK and
G6Pase genes, whereas HCV infection down-regulates GK gene
(Deng et al., 2011).

Both HCV replicon cells and HCV-infected cells produced
greater amounts of glucose than the control cells. IFN treatment
canceled the enhanced glucose production in HCV replicon cells
as well as in HCV-infected cells. G6P is an important precur-
sor molecule that is converted to glucose in the gluconeogenesis
pathway (Figure 1). Our metabolite analysis showed that a sig-
niﬁcantly higher level of G6P was accumulated in HCV-infected
cells than in the control cells, suggesting that HCV indeed pro-
motes hepatic gluconeogenesis to cause hyperglycemia. There is a
trend toward an increase in gluconeogenesis in HCV-infected cells
(Figure 1).

HCV INFECTION PROMOTES HEPATIC GLUCONEOGENESIS
Then we analyzed hepatic glucose production and expression of
transcription factors using HCV replicon cells and HCVcc system
in order to clarify a role of HCV infection in glucose meta-
bolic changes. Hepatic glucose production is usually regulated by

2008), Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15; Takashima et al., 2010), and
cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB;
Rozance et al., 2008). While we were analyzing these factors in
both HCV replicon cells and HCV J6/JFH1-infected cells, we found
the involvement of the FoxO1 in the transcriptional activation of
G6Pase and PEPCK (Deng et al., 2011). It is known that the FoxO1
enhances gluconeogenesis through the transcriptional activation
of various genes, including G6Pase and PEPCK (Gross et al., 2008).
The function of FoxO1 is regulated by post-translational modiﬁ-
cations, including phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and acetyla-
tion (Tzivion et al., 2011). The phosphorylated form of FoxO1
is exported from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in loss
of its transcriptional activity (Figure 2). Phosphorylation sta-
tus of FoxO1 at Ser319 is critical for FoxO1 nuclear exclusion
(Zhao et al., 2004). Although the total amounts of FoxO1 protein
were unchanged, FoxO1 phosphorylation at Ser319 was markedly
suppressed in HCV-infected cells compared to that in the mock-
infected cells. It is known that the FoxO1 is phosphorylated by the
protein kinase Akt and is exported from the nucleus to the cytosol,
resulting in loss of its transcriptional activity (Tzivion et al., 2011).
The majority of FoxO1 was accumulated in the nuclear fraction in
HCV-infected cells, whereas in control cells FoxO1 was distributed
in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Akt phosphoryla-
tion was enhanced in HCV-infected cells, although the protein
levels of total Akt protein were comparable, which is consistent
with the report by Burdette et al. (2010). Our ﬁndings suggest
an interesting scenario in which the HCV-mediated suppression
in FoxO1 phosphorylation is caused by an unknown mechanism
independent of Akt activity.

HCV-INDUCED JNK ACTIVATION IS INVOLVED IN THE
SUPPRESSION OF FoxO1 PHOSPHORYLATION
It is known that the stress-sensitive serine/threonine kinase JNK
regulates FoxO at multiple levels (van der Horst and Burgering,
2007; Karpac and Jasper, 2009). We demonstrated that HCV infec-
tion induces phosphorylation and activation of JNK in a time-
dependent manner, which is similar to that observed for the sup-
pression of FoxO1 phosphorylation. As a result, c-Jun, a key sub-
strate for JNK, got phosphorylated and activated in HCV-infected
cells. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 clearly prevented the phospho-
rylation of c-Jun, and concomitantly recovered the suppression
of FoxO1 phosphorylation in HCV-infected cells, suggesting that
HCV activates the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway, resulting in the
nuclear accumulation of FoxO1 by reducing its phosphorylation
status. The detailed mechanisms of HCV-induced suppression
of FoxO1 phosphorylation via the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway
remain to be explored. There are at least two possibilities. The
JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway (1) suppresses a protein kinase, or
(2) activates a protein phosphatase to reduce phosphorylation of
FoxO1.

HCV-INDUCED MITOCHONDRIAL REACTIVE OXYGEN
SPECIES PRODUCTION IS INVOLVED IN INCREASED
GLUCOSE PRODUCTION THROUGH JNK ACTIVATION
Hepatitis C virus infection increases mitochondrial reactive oxy-
gen species (ROS) production (Deng et al., 2008). N -acetyl cys-
teine (NAC; a general antioxidant) clearly prevented the phos-
phorylation of JNK, and concomitantly canceled the suppression
of FoxO1 phosphorylation in HCV-infected cells, suggesting that

HCV infection induces mitochondria damage and ROS production, leading to
JNK activation. HCV NS4A protein is involved in mitochondrial damage. HCV

NS5A protein is involved in ROS production. HCV-induced ROS production
causes JNK activation, resulting in the decreased phosphorylation and nuclear
accumulation of FoxO1. Nuclear accumulation of FoxO1 up-regulates gene
expression of PEPCK and G6Pase, leading eventually to increased glucose
production by gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels in the hepatocytes may
confer an advantage in efﬁcient replication of HCV.

HCV-induced glucose metabolic disorders

HCV-induced ROS production is involved in the JNK activation.
There was no signiﬁcant difference in HCV RNA replication or
infectious virus release between SP600125- or NAC-treated HCV-
infected cells and non-treated HCV-infected cells. These results
suggest that ROS-mediated JNK activation plays a key role in the
suppression of FoxO1 phosphorylation, nuclear accumulation of
FoxO1, and enhancement of glucose production in HCV-infected
cells (Deng et al., 2011).

HCV NS5A IS INVOLVED IN THE ENHANCEMENT OF
GLUCOSE PRODUCTION
Then we sought to determine which HCV protein(s) is involved
in the enhancement of glucose production. Transient expres-
sion of NS5A protein in Huh-7.5 cells signiﬁcantly promoted
the gene expression levels of G6Pase and PEPCK determined
by real time quantitative RT-PCR. Promoter assay revealed that
the level of PEPCK promoter activity was signiﬁcantly higher in
NS5A-expressing cells than in the control cells. Our results suggest
that NS5A activate both the PEPCK promoter and the G6Pase
promoter, leading to an increase in glucose production (Deng
et al., 2011). The study by Banerjee et al. (2010) suggests that
the HCV core protein modulates FoxO1 and FoxA2 activation
and affects insulin-induced metabolic gene regulation in human
hepatocytes. Our results, however, suggest that the HCV core pro-
tein is not signiﬁcantly involved in the increased gluconeogenesis
(Deng et al., 2011). The difference between these two studies needs
to be explored.

There were previous reports suggesting that ROS production
is induced in NS5A-expressing cells (Dionisio et al., 2009) or in
hepatocytes of NS5A transgenic mice (Wang et al., 2009). We there-
fore sought to determine whether NS5A contributes to increased
hepatic gluconeogenesis through the induction of ROS produc-
tion. NS5A-expressing cells displayed a much stronger signal of
ROS than in control cells. NS5A-expressing cells promoted phos-
phorylation level at Ser63 of c-Jun and suppressed FoxO1 phos-
phorylation at Ser319, suggesting that NS5A mediates JNK/c-Jun
activation and FoxO1 phosphorylation suppression. These results
suggest that NS5A play a role in the HCV-induced enhancement of
hepatic gluconeogenesis through JNK/c-Jun activation and FoxO1
phosphorylation suppression.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Taken together, we propose a model of HCV-induced glucose
metabolic disorders as shown in Figure 2. HCV infection down-
regulates cell surface expression of GLUT2 in hepatocytes at the
transcriptional level. HCV down-regulates a transcription fac-
tor involved in GLUT2 gene expression through an unknown
mechanism. As GLUT2 is a facilitative GLUT, it ensures large
bidirectional ﬂuxes of glucose in and out the cell due to its low
afﬁnity and high capacity (Leturque et al., 2009). Down-regulated

cell surface expression of GLUT2 results in disruption of bidi-
rectional transport of glucose in hepatocytes. Even in the fasting
state, down-regulation of GLUT2 may result in low glucose uptake
of hepatocytes, causing hyperglycemia. In the fed state, glucose
secretion from hepatocytes may be suppressed due to low level
cell surface expression of GLUT2, as GLUT2 is a bidirectional
transporter.

Hepatitis C virus infection induces mitochondria damage and
ROS production, leading to JNK activation. HCV NS4A protein
is involved in mitochondrial damage (Nomura-Takigawa et al.,
2006). HCV NS5A protein is involved in ROS production (Dion-
isio et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Deng et al., 2011). HCV-
induced ROS production causes JNK activation, which results
in the decreased phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of
FoxO1 by an unidentiﬁed mechanism. Nuclear accumulation of
FoxO1 up-regulates gene expression of PEPCK and G6Pase, lead-
ing eventually to increased glucose production by gluconeogenesis
(Deng et al., 2011).

These two pathways, HCV-induced down-regulation of GLUT2
expression and up-regulation of gluconeogenesis, may con-
tribute to development of type 2 diabetes in HCV-infected
patients at least to some extent. HCV-induced down-regulation
of GLUT2 expression and up-regulation of gluconeogene-
sis may result
in high concentration of glucose in HCV-
infected hepatocytes. As suggested in a recent study, low glu-
cose concentration in the hepatocytes inhibits HCV replication
(Nakashima et al., 2011). Therefore, high glucose levels in the
hepatocytes may confer an advantage in efﬁcient replication
of HCV.

Our understanding of HCV-induced glucose metabolic disor-
ders will require much more work to fully unfold this pathway.
Further investigation including the mechanism of HCV-induced
GLUT2 downregualtion, JNK-mediated decreased phosphoryla-
tion of FoxO1, and the possible effect(s) of the dysregulation of
hepatic gluconeogenesis on the HCV life cycle and host cells are
currently under way.
