Abstract
A current strategy for the design of neutralizing antibody-based vaccines to prevent HIV-1
transmission is that of reverse engineering, starting from a neutralizing antibody and working back to
reconstruct its epitope by structure-based design technology. However, the field has been impeded
by a lack of appropriate antibodies for use as templates. Recently, new antibodies have been
described that may fulfil this role, invigorating the field.

Introduction and context
The human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is
the cause of AIDS and responsible for a major global
pandemic, with an estimated 33 million people infected.
The most cost-effective mechanism of infectious disease
control is vaccination, but to date we have seen only
modest success at reducing HIV-1 transmission in a
single vaccine efficacy trial [1].

Of the two effector arms of the adaptive immune system
involved in vaccine-mediated protection against infec-
tious disease (cytotoxic T cell and antibody), antibodies
are most
likely to be effective in preventing HIV-1
infection [2-4]. The only target of neutralizing antibodies
(NAbs) on HIV-1 is the virally encoded Env glycoprotein.
Env is a trimer of heterodimers, each of which is
composed of a receptor-binding surface glycoprotein
(gp120) and a fusogenic transmembrane glycopro-
tein (gp41),
linked together by non-covalent bonds
(Figure 1a) [5]. The majority of Env is cloaked in
carbohydrate (Figure 1b) and is highly variable (a) in
terms of amino acid sequence between individual virus
strains and (b) within an individual virus in terms of Env
tertiary and quaternary conformational flexibility [6,7].
These potent immune evasion strategies mean that most
NAbs will bind to only a few strains of virus and
frequently only with low avidity.

A recent concept is that of using NAbs as templates for
recreation of their epitopes in a context different from that
of the natural antigen [7-9]. For example, the sequence of
a linear epitope can be used to design synthetic peptides
that may induce the same specificity of antibody when
used as an immunogen. Unfortunately, all linear NAb
epitopes discovered to date in Env, excluding some
binding within the membrane-proximal external region
(MPER) of gp41 (see below), are highly variable and so
induce only antibodies that neutralize a narrow range of
viral strains. But neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
(NMAbs) that recognize conformation-dependent epi-
topes and that neutralize a wide spectrum of viral strains
exist, and these are under development as templates for
vaccine antigen design. Until this past year, four NAbs of
human origin had dominated the field: IgG1b12, a
recombinant NAb derived from a phage-display library
that recognizes the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) on gp120;
2G12, an NMAb binding a glycan epitope on gp120; and
2F5 and 4E10, two NMAbs binding the MPER of gp41
(Figure 1) [2,6,7]. Although the epitopes of all of these
antibodies are defined and have been excellent prototypes
for studying breadth of neutralization, each of these
NMAbs has specific difficulties that so far have prevented
its successful use as an antigen design template (for
details, see [7,8]). Moreover, it is unclear whether these
antibodies represent rare or even unique events in B-cell

The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is shown as a transparent mesh and represents three gp120 molecules non-covalently linked to three gp41
molecules on the surface of an HIV-1 virion [7]. The overall Env structure was obtained at a resolution of approximately 20 Ã… by cryo-electron
tomography and was modified from [21]. gp120 (red) was located into the electron tomography model using the b12-bound atomic coordinates [22].
(a) Regions on gp120 or gp41 approximating to prototype broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (BNMAb) and new BNMAb epitopes are labelled with
arrows. The IgG1b12-binding surface is labelled yellow, and the bases of the variable regions (missing in this structure) are labelled blue, green, and pink.
(b) The same model with the gp120 glycans shown in blue reveals the extensive glycosylation present as an antibody evasion mechanism on Env, and
glycans implicated in BNMAb 2G12 binding are highlighted in white and labelled with an arrow. HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type-1; MPER,

clonal selection or affinity maturation (or both). A related
question is whether the relatively rare HIV-1-infected
individuals with high-potency, broad-spectrum neutrali-
zing antisera make individual NAbs with specificities that
target highly conserved surfaces on Env or whether the
neutralization breadth and potency of their sera are
predominantly the sum of multiple responses each
directed against a strain-specific epitope. We now have
answers to these questions in the form of an analysis of
the specificities of neutralization in high-titer antisera and
several new NMAbs of unusual breadth and potency.

Major recent advances
The availability of high-throughput neutralization assays
containing chimeric viruses expressing panels of Env
cloned from diverse HIV-1 strains has allowed estimates
of the proportion of HIV-1-infected individuals with
substantial breadth and titer of serum neutralization
[10]. This figure approaches 25% of chronically infected
individuals [11-13], raising hope that such responses
could be elicited by vaccination in a sizeable proportion
of the general population. Strategies based mainly upon
affinity trapping of distinct antibody specificities fol-
lowed by functional analysis of neutralization have
allowed mapping of the serum NAb response to HIV-1
with improved resolution and have revealed that the
CD4bs is an important target of broadly neutralizing
antibody (BNAb) [14,15]. Other regions targeted more
rarely by BNAb are the gp41 MPER and the coreceptor-
binding region [12]. Several of
the studies found
multiple NAb specificities, some of which were not
accounted for by the known BNAb epitopes, implying
novel conserved targets [15-17]. Representatives of such
novel specificities were recently reported by Walker and
colleagues [18] in the form of two related broadly
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (BNMAbs) (PG9
and PG16) that neutralized approximately 80-90% of
representative HIV-1 strains with potencies approxi-
mately 10-fold greater than those of
the previous
BNMAbs. These BNMAbs were cloned from B cells of
an HIV-1-infected individual with unusual breadth of
serum neutralization activity and were found to bind
complex discontinuous epitopes present only on the
functional Env structure [18] (Figure 1a). Currently, it is
unclear whether these BNMAbs bind epitopes that span
more than one protomer within the trimer or whether
they bind individual protomers that require a trimeric
context
the
quaternary structure dependency of the epitope will
present particular challenges for antigen design. Another
study found a new BNMAb (HJ16) reactive with an
epitope within the CD4bs which is distinct
from
IgG1b12 but neutralizes a similar proportion (30-40%)
of strains [19]. The epitope appears to be robustly

expressed on monomeric gp120 under various condi-
tions, suggesting that it may be amenable to structure-
based reiteration. Finally, using a new structure-based
strategy for selecting CD4bs-specific B cells, a very recent
study reports on the isolation of antibodies (VRC01 and
VRC02) that neutralize up to 90% of circulating strains
of virus at

infected individuals gives hope that vaccine antigens

low concentration [20]. At present,

Future directions
The concept of structure-based vaccine design relies on
the elucidation of the atomic structure of the target
epitope, and this is under way for the recently isolated
BNMAbs described above. The translation of structures
into antigens for re-eliciting such NAb specificities is a
major hurdle since the field has yet to demonstrate proof
of principle for this concept. Antibody epitopes that are
continuous or conformationally stable (or both) will be
the easiest to mimic, and since epitope discovery is
largely empiric, it will be important to isolate as many
BNMAbs as possible to improve the chances of success in
the design of antigens. Once antigens that re-elicit the
desired antibody specificities are available,
the next
challenges to overcome will be those of B-cell immuno-
dominance and of
increasing the magnitude and
persistence of the B-cell response to vaccination. Not
enough is known of the mechanisms underlying these
factors, but much will depend upon the adjuvants used
to deliver robust T-cell help, B-cell activation, and
subsequent affinity maturation and the long-term
persistence of antibody-producing plasma cells at the
appropriate anatomical locations. Research into all of
these areas should be carried out in parallel as a high
priority.
