Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are accumulated in our body through food chain and cause a variety of adverse health eff ects 
including neurotoxicities such as cognitive deficits and motor dysfunction. In particular, neonates are considered as a high risk 
group for the neurotoxicity of PCBs exposure. Th  e present study attempted to analyze the structure-activity relationship among 
PCB congeners and the mechanism of PCBs-induced neurotoxicity. We measured total protein kinase C (PKC) activities, PKC 
isoforms, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and induction of neurogranin (RC-3) and growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) mRNA 
in cerebellar granule cells of neonatal rats with phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu) binding assay, western blot, ROS assay, and 
reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis respectively following the different structural PCBs exposure. Only non-coplanar 
PCBs showed a significant increase of total PKC-α and βII activity as measured with [3H]PDBu binding assay. ROS were more 
increased with non-coplanar PCBs than coplanar PCBs. The mRNA levels of RC-3 and GAP-43 were more induced with non-
coplanar PCBs than coplanar PCBs, indicating that these factors may be useful biomarkers for diff erentiating non-coplanar PCBs 
from coplanar PCBs. Non-coplanar PCBs may be more potent neurotoxic congeners than coplanar PCBs. This study provides 
evidences that non-coplanar PCBs, which have been neglected in the risk assessment processes, should be added in the future to 
improve the quality and accuracy of risk assessment on the neuroendocrinal adverse eff ects of PCBs exposures.

INTRODUCTION

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are typical aromatic environ-
mental pollutants that are accumulated through the food chain,

decades, also cause environmental pollution on a continuous basis 
through industrial products have been generated in the past [1]. 
PCBs are characterized by carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, 
and immunotoxicity and have recently been known to disrupt 
neurotransmitters [2-4]. In animal testing, PCBs, which disrupt 
control of neurotransmitters and thyroid hormone in the brain, 
hinder normal brain development and exert eff ects on intellectual 
developments, such as behavior, cognition, and memory. These 
effects are known to be more serious especially in the brain of 
fetuses or infants where neuronal cells are developing actively [5].
PCBs have 209 theoretical congeners, the chemical structures

of which can make differences to toxicities; therefore, toxic 
actions based on the structures are important in assessing 
their toxicities. Since dioxin and dioxin-like compounds are 
known to make diverse toxic actions via the medium of an aryl 
hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor, the Toxic Equivalent Factor (TEF), 
which assesses toxicity on the basis of reaction to an Ah receptor, 
has been introduced to the concept of toxicity assessment [1]. 
PCBs are divided into coplanar (dioxin-like) PCBs reacting to 
an Ah receptor and non-coplanar (non-dioxin-like) PCBs with 
no affinity to an Ah receptor. The former has a similar structure 
to dioxin and makes similar toxic actions to dioxin while the 
latter tends to be neglected in risk assessment since it has shown 
no remarkable action mechanism or serious toxicity. However, 
the results of animal testing show that when Aroclor 1256 with 
both coplanar and non-coplanar structures is administered non-
coplanar structure is mostly accumulated in the brain [6]. Since 
non-coplanar PCBs have greater eff ects on the changes in neural 
development in brain cells than coplanar PCBs, many researches 
are being conducted on neurotoxicities of non-coplanar PCBs 
[7]. As non-coplanar PCBs have recently been known to have 
no reaction to an Ah receptor but be sensitive to the secondary 
signaling system and neurotransmitters of the brain, be detected 
most frequently in breast milk, and be able to affect intellectual 
and behavioral development of young children, it is necessary to 
introduce a new concept of risk assessment [8].
Non-coplanar PCBs are known to activate protein kinase 
C (PKC) in cerebellar granule cells. PKC has 11 congeners or 
more, which vary in their intracellular distribution or action. 
While PKC-α and PKC-ε were shown to be target substances for 
2,2’-dichlorobiphenyl [4], it is not known what PKC congeners are 
targets for PCB congeners and how their intracellular distribution 
varies.
It is known that PCBs decrease thyroid hormone (T4) of the 
brain in the growth period and that the decrease in thyroid 
hormone of the brain is closely related to oxidative stress [9]. 
Dioxin-like compounds greatly increase cytochrome p450 
(CYP1A1, 1A2) via an Ah receptor. This increase in metabolic 
enzyme forms reactive-oxygen metabolites and causes oxidant 
stress [10]. As an important signal to cause such phenomena as 
apoptosis, the oxidative stress is also known to aff ect the cell cycle 
and have association with hypothyroidism in the growth-phase 
brain. So while oxidative stress may be a main action mechanism 
of PCBs-induced neuroendocrine disruption, there has been no 
research on this issue.
Neurotoxicity related to neuroendocrine disruption is 
getting much attention as a new feature of PCBs [8, 11]. PCBs 
neurotoxicities related to the neuroendocrine system cause

changing of signaling pathway, hindrance to dopamine and 
serotonin synthesis, and decreased thyroid hormone in the 
growth-phase brain. Among them, the decrease in thyroid 
hormone is a typical phenomenon, which can transform 
neurofi lament present within neuronal cells and prevent normal 
cell growth. In particular, thyroid hormone plays an important role 
in extracellular matrices, such as myelin-associated glycoprotein, 
Tenescin-C, GAP (growth associated protein)-43, and fi bronectin, 
which are involved in neuronal cell migration and development 
[12-14]. Th  yroid hormone is also known to control PKC activity 
through neurogranin (RC-3), which is a PKC matrix present in the 
brain alone [15]. However, relations between many types of PCBs 
and extracellular matrices are rarely researched.
This study aims to analyze a neural action mechanism for 
different structural PCBs affecting growth and development of 
neuronal cells and control of neuroendocrine hormone in order 
to help the understanding of the eff ects of PCBs on neurotoxicity. 
An attempt is also made to help effi  cient risk assessment of PCBs 
and provide basic data to assess neurotoxicity more effi  ciently via 
developing a biomarker sensitive to the structural features.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reagents and materials
This study used Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) produced 
by AccuStandard (New Haven, CT, USA) and other essential 
reagents produced by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 
Reagents related to cell culture, including Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle’s medium (DMEM), were purchased from Gibco BRL 
(Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and those related to assessment of 
reactive oxygen species from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). 
The following PCB congeners were selected to make a relative 
comparison between coplanar and non-coplanar structures: 
3,3’,4,4’,5-Penta-CB (PCB 126), 3,3’,4,4’,5,5’-Hexa-CB (PCB 169), 
2,2’-Di-CB (PCB 4), and Aroclor 1256.

Methods
Cytotoxicity test: Cells were treated with PCBs for 24 hours 
and centrifuged to isolate cells from a cell culture medium. 1% 
concentration of Triton X-100 was finally added to the isolated 
cells, which were then observed for 30 minutes for lysation. 100 
μl of 4.6 mM pyruvic acid and 100 μl of 0.4 mg/ml β-NADPH 
were mixed with the cell culture medium and cell lysate, 
respectively, with absorbance measured at 340 nm. As for lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) isolation, LDH activities measured in the 
cell culture medium and cell lysate, respectively, were revised in 
volumes to present as a percentage of LDH isolated from the total

LDH.
Cerebellar granule cell culture: Since neurotoxicity of PCBs 
is closely related to the cerebellum and the brain of newborn 
babies at the active growth phase is especially sensitive to it, this 
study used a 7-day-old cerebellar granule cell at the active growth 
phase as an experimental model. The cerebellum of a 7-day-old 
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat was isolated and treated with trypsin. 
Th  e fi nal cell concentration was fi xed at 1×106 cells/ml; 1.5 ml cell 
suspension was added to the 12-well culture plate treated with 
poly-L-lysine, which was then cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 
37oC. Cytosine arabinoside (5 μM) was administered to inhibit 
growth of non-neuronal cells 24 to 48 hours aft er cell implantation 
[7]. It was cultured for 7 days and, then, exposed to endocrine 
disruptors.
[3H]phorbol ester binding: Cells cultured in a 12-well cul-
ture plate for 7 days were cleansed with Locke’s buffer (154 mM 
NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 3.6 mM NaHCO3, 2.3 mM CaCl2, 5.6 mM 
D-glucose, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) and cultured for 15 minutes 
with Locke’s buffer containing 1 nM [3H]PDBu (phorbol 
12,13-dibutyrate) and experimental materials. After removing 
the culture medium, it was cleansed with a buffer solution three 
times and made turbid by 1 ml of 0.1 M NaOH; then, 0.7 ml of it 
was mixed with 9 ml of Ultima gold to measure radioactivity with 
scintillation spectroscopy [7].
Cell fractionation: To extract PKC isozyme from between 
cytosol and membrane fraction, the cultured cell or brain tissue 
exposed to an environmental pollutant was treated with buff er A 
(20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 M sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, protease 
inhibitors, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfl uoride (PMSF), 10 μg/
ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin). By implementing centrifugation 
at 100,000×g for an hour after sonication, the upper layer was 
isolated with cytosol fraction, deposits were extracted with buff er 
B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 
mM EGTA, 1mM EDTA, protease inhibitors) for 30 minutes and 
centrifuged, and supernatant was isolated with detergent-soluble 
membrane fraction.
Western blot: Western blot was performed on cellular fraction 
to measure the changes in PKC congeners. A sample of cellular 
fraction was electrophoresed (7.5% SDS-PAGE) in 12.5% gel, 
blotted on nitrocellulose paper at 400 mA using Bio-rad’s transfer 
chamber for 4 hours, and made to react with blocking buff er for an 
hour, with each of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies diluted at 
a proper level and made to react for an hour. It was cleansed twice 
with Tris-buff ered saline, made to react with secondary IgG for an 
hour, made to react using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) 
system, exposed to an X-ray fi lm for the optimum period of time, 
and developed [16].

Analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS):  2’,7’-dichloro-
fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) is lipophilic, passes well 
into cells, and is transformed into the fluorescent material 
2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by hydrogen peroxide and 
peroxidase within cells. So it is widely used to measure activities of 
intracellular ROS through DCE measurements. Aft er cell culture 
in a 12-well culture plate, it was cleansed with lock’s buff er, treated 
with the fluorescent material DCFH-DA in a darkroom for 15 
minutes, cleansed again, given cell lysis with NaOH, and measured 
at excitation 488 nm and emission 525 nm using luminescence 
spectrometer. Other details of the procedure are based on other 
studies [17]. To evaluate interactions with mercury well known as 
a neurotoxic material, comparison was made between treatment 
with mercury chloride alone and co-treatment with PCBs.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR): Since neuroendocrine hormone control disorder is 
closely related to changes in extracellular matrices of neuronal 
cells, mRNA manifestation of RC-3 and GAP-43, which are 
extracellular matrices related to neuronal cell migration and 
development, was analyzed using RT-PCR to assess the effects 
on growth and development of neuronal cells. Total RNA was 
extracted from the cells, oligo d(T) primer was added to 1 μg of 
total RNA, which was then made to react at 60oC for 5 minutes 
to recover mRNA. 30 μl RT mix (0.1 M DTT, RNA guard, RT-
buffer, dNTP, dH2O, RT) was added to each sample, which was 
then stagnated at 37oC for 60 minutes and at 70oC for 10 minutes 
and stored in ice to synthesize cDNA. After the cDNA process, 
47.5 μl of PCR mix [PCR-buff er, dH2O, Taq polymerase, 5’-primer, 
3’-primer, dNTP-mix (32P-labelled)] was added to 2.5 μl of cDNA, 
and annealing temperature and the number of cycles were fixed 
at the optimum level on the basis of primer. Primer sets for 
Interleukin-1 (Forward: ATGGCGAGAAGTACCTAAGCT, 
Re v               erse: ACACAAATTGCATGGTGAAGT), Interleukin-6 
(Forward: ATGAACTCCTTCTCCACAAGCGC, Reverse: GAA-

ward: ATGAGCACAGAAAGCATGATC, Reve rse: TACAGGCT-
TGTCACTCGAATT), and GAPDH (Forward: GCACAGTCAA-
GGCCGAGAAT, Reverse: GCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAA) were 
used (Table 1). It was electrophoresed in 10% PAGE, dried with 
a gel dryer, stored in an X-ray cassette at 75oC below zero, and 
developed [16].

On the basis of this result, therefore, the contents showing no

exposure.

Eff ects of protein kinase C
When general activity of PKC was analyzed using [3H]PDBu, 
non-coplanar PCBs were found to be more active than coplanar 
PCBs (Table 2). While PCB 126 and PCB 169 in the coplanar 
structure showed no remarkable change even at 50 μM, PCB 
4 in the non-coplanar structure had binding increased by 
approximately 1.5 times. The commercial mixture containing a 
large amount of non-coplanar PCBs, Aroclor 1256, also showed 
the same level of increase in binding to PCB 4. It was therefore 
suggested that PCB causing PKC activity within neuronal cells 
had a significant non-coplanar structure. When PKC congeners 
playing an important role for the signaling system were analyzed 
with western blot, PKC-α made no apparent migration in PCB 
126 or PCB 169 but made apparent migration from cytosol 
to membrane in PCB 4 and Aroclor 1256 (Fig. 2A). Similar 
observations were made from PKC-βII (Fig. 2B).

Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
In terms of involvement of PCBs in ROS generation for neuronal 
cells, PCBs in the coplanar structure, such as PCB 126 and PCB 
169, increased ROS generation by 1.3 times while PCB 4 and 
Aroclor 1256 increased it by 1.7 times. While both PCB structures 
were involved in ROS generation, non-coplanar PCBs generated 
more ROS (Fig. 3A). When making a comparison between 
treatment with mercury chloride alone and co-treatment with 
PCBs, the former increased it by 1.2 times while co-treatment 
with both coplanar and non-coplanar PCBs synergistically 
increased ROS generation (Fig. 3B). But only marginal statistical 
signifi cances were observed in the ROS generation tests.

Structure-activity relationship for neuronal cell growth 
factors 
When extracellular matrices related to neuroendocrine hormone 
control disorders were analyzed using RT-PCR, mRNA of RC-3 
showed no change in PCB 126 or PCB 169 but increased in non-
coplanar PCBs, such as PCB 4 and Aroclor 1256, suggesting that 
a structure-activity relationship existed (Fig. 4A). The mRNA 
of GAP-43 increased in non-coplanar PCBs, such as PCB 4 and 
Aroclor 1256 but showed no increase in coplanar PCBs (Fig. 4B). 
But only marginal statistical significances were observed in the 
tests using growth factors.

DISCUSSION

PCBs disrupt control of neuroendocrine systems, such as thyroid 
hormone (T4), serotonin, and dopamine in the brain, and also 
exert eff ects on the secondary messenger related to the signaling 
pathway in the nervous system. A typical example of disruption 
in the neuroendocrine systems by PCBs is a decrease in thyroid 
hormone, which is known to control PKC activity through RC-3 
which is the PKC matrix present in the brain alone [15], and the 
decrease in thyroid hormone is known to be closely related to 
activity of PKC [18]. PKC also plays an important role in main 
action mechanisms of the neurotoxic symptoms of PCBs such as 

motor dysfunction and decreased learning ability and memory. 
The cerebellum was used as the target area for experiment since 
the neurotoxicities of PCBs are closely related to the cerebellum. 
Since the brain of newborn babies at the active growth phase is 
especially sensitive to the eff ect of neurotoxicity, this study used a 
7-day-old cerebellar granule cell at the active growth phase as an 
experimental model.
In terms of [3H]PDBu binding, which means PKC migration to 
membrane for binding, non-coplanar PCBs were more infl uential 
on PKC activation than coplanar PCBs. It was therefore suggested 
that there was structure-activity relationship in the PKC-related 
signaling pathway. Dependence of an Ah receptor is important in

establishing basis for comparison risk assessment of neurotoxicity 
of environmental pollutants with the existing Equivalency Factor 
(TEF) value. Th  erefore, the diff erent eff ects based on the structure 
alone in this study may be very useful in predicting possibility of 
neurotoxicity.
As for PCBs-induced PKC activity using western blot, PKC-α 
and βII were higher than other PKC congeners, therefore they 
may be usable as indicators of the neurotoxic effects according 
to the PCBs structure. They can also give an opportunity to 
discover target substances of PCBs, possibly contributing to the 
understanding of mechanism of the signaling pathway in the 
PCBs-related neurotoxicity.
In the ROS assay, non-coplanar PCBs increased ROS generation 
more than coplanar PCBs. Th  is implies that damage to neuronal 
cells by PCBs was related to structure-activity. Th  ere were greater 
increases in ROS generations with mercury chloride regardless of 
the PCBs structure. So there is more damage to the nervous system 
caused by PCBs exposure when the existing neurotoxic substances 
are present. This implies that as for daily exposure to PCBs via 
industrial products, intake of foods possibly high in mercury, such 
as tuna and shark, can increase damage to the nervous system.
RC-3 and GAP-43 play an important role in controlling 
intracellular calcium concentration and are also closely related to 
PKC activity. When PCBs-induced changes of RC-3 and GAP-43 
were analyzed using RT-PCR, non-coplanar PCBs increased RC-3 
and GAP-43 while coplanar PCBs made no significant change. 
Th  ese results are assumed not to be mediated by an Ah receptor 
but to be involved in a specifi c action mechanism of non-coplanar 
PCBs. Th  e fact that the increase in GAP-43 is irrelevant to an Ah 
receptor implies that GAP-43 is playing a specific role in non-
coplanar PCBs-induced PKC activity and intracellular calcium 
concentration. Therefore, any change in growth-related factors, 
such as RC-3 and GAP-43, in the growth-phase brain cells may 
be used as an indicator determining coplanar and non-coplanar 
structure-activity relationship in PCB mixture.

This study obtained the cerebellar granule cells from a 7-day-
old SD rat and secured a technique for isolating, purifying, 
and culturing over 90% pure neurons to study an intracellular 
mechanism for many compounds related to neurotoxicity. This 
study also obtained a growth-phase brain cell model to screen 
neurotoxic substances to which the cells were vulnerable in the 
growth period. PCBs-induced neurotoxic mechanism for the 
fetus or infant group has been rarely known. Th  is study indicate 
that non-coplanar PCBs were an important neurotoxic substance 
in the brain cells by exerting greater effects on PKC activity and 
neuronal cell growth factors in the growth-phase cerebellar cells 
than coplanar PCBs.
The results from this study can provide the base for screening 
coplanar and non-coplanar structures among PCB mixtures 
present in environment or foods. They are also assumed to 
be usable in understanding and distinguishing neurotoxic 
mechanisms of other similar environmental pollutants this study 
didn’t deal with. The results will help securing structure-activity 
relationship (SAR) of PCBs, effi  ciently screening neuroendocrine 
disrupting factors present in foods or environment, and 
contributing to improvement in effi  ciency of risk assessment.
