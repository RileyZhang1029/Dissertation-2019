Leishmania are transmitted by the bite of their sand ﬂy vector and this has a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the virulence of the resulting infection. From our studies into the interaction
between parasite, vector, and host we have uncovered an important missing ingredient dur-
ing Leishmania transmission. Leishmania actively adapt their sand ﬂy hosts into efﬁcient
vectors by secreting Promastigote Secretory Gel (PSG), a proteophosphoglycan (PPG)-rich,
mucin-like gel which accumulates in sand ﬂy gut and mouthparts. This has the effect of
blocking the ﬂy, such that during bloodfeeding both parasites and gel are co-transmitted in
an act of regurgitation. We are discovering that this has further implications for the mam-
malian infection, again, in favor of the parasite. Experimentally, PSG exacerbates cutaneous
and visceral leishmaniasis and can promote the chronicity of Leishmania infection, even
in mouse strains normally capable of controlling leishmaniasis. The underlying mechanism
of PSG’s action is a major focus of our ongoing work. This review aims to synthesize what
is known about the role and action of PSG and its constituent proteophosphoglycans, for
parasite colonization of the sand ﬂy, transmission, and mammalian infection. Lastly, we dis-
cuss potential exploitation of this important vector-transmitted product and future avenues
of research.

INTRODUCTION
Leishmaniasis is a signiﬁcant neglected tropical disease placing
350 million people in 88 countries Worldwide at risk of infection
(WHO, 2010). It is caused by protozoa of the genus Leishma-
nia, which require a female phlebotomine sand ﬂy for transmis-
sion. Depending on the species of parasite and the host immune
response leishmaniasis can range from self-limiting cutaneous
lesions through to life-threatening infections of the liver and spleen
if not detected and treated early enough.

To be transmitted by a sand ﬂy the Leishmania must overcome
a number of challenges within the sand ﬂy gut and complete up to
four transformations to the mammal infective stage, the metacyclic
promastigote (Sacks and Kamhawi, 2001 and references therein).
However, the majority of Leishmania’s interaction with its vector
at the molecular level still remains unknown. A common feature
of Leishmania-infected sand ﬂies is the presence of a mass of par-
asites embedded within a gel-like material (Stierhof et al., 1999).
The origin of the gel was unknown until relatively recently, when
it was demonstrated to derive from the parasite, now termed the
promastigote secretory gel (PSG; Rogers et al., 2002). PSG is com-
prised largely of Leishmania proteophosphoglycans (PPGs). It has
been proposed that the PSG improves the efﬁciency of Leishmania
transmission by blocking the lumen of the insect’s anterior midgut
and stomodeal valve, resulting in a regurgitation of metacyclic pro-
mastigotes during an attempted bloodmeal (Stierhof et al., 1999).
We have elaborated on this model and have shown that Leishma-
nia PPGs in the form of PSG can manipulate the bloodfeeding
behavior of its vector and the immune system of the mammalian

host to promote Leishmania transmission and infection. This adds
PPGs/PSG to the list of known components of Leishmania trans-
mission, accompanying parasites and vector’s saliva into the skin
(Figure 1).

LEISHMANIA PROTEOPHOSPHOGLYCANS AND THE
PROMASTIGOTE SECRETORY GEL
Leishmania synthesize abundant phosphoglycan (PG)-containing
molecules made up of [Gal-Man-PO(4)] repeating units, includ-
ing the surface lipophosphoglycan (LPG), and the surface and
secreted PPGs (Figure 2). To date around 70 species of sand
ﬂy have been incriminated as vectors of leishmaniasis, of which,
30 have convincing evidence (Lane, 1993; Bates, 2007). In a
signiﬁcant number of these vectorial combinations a notice-
able feature of heavily infected sand ﬂies is the presence of
the blockage in the anterior midgut formed by a mass of
parasites embedded in PSG (Table 1); including a Leishma-
nia species isolated from day biting midges, the causative agent
of cutaneous leishmaniasis in red kangaroos (Dougall et al.,
2011). Scanning electron microscopy of Phlebotomus papatasi
and Lutzomyia longipalpis midguts infected with Leishmania
major and L. mexicana, respectively, found a dense matrix
of ﬁlaments which surrounded the parasites (Stierhof et al.,
1999). These networks were identiﬁed as ﬁlamentous proteophos-
phoglycan (fPPG), the largest molecule secreted by Leishma-
nia (3–6 nm diameter and up to 6 µm length) and is bio-
chemically indistinguishable from fPPG secreted by parasites in
culture.

The role of proteophosphoglycans in leishmaniasis

In culture Leishmania tend to form aggregates. Electron
microscopy of these clumps of cells revealed a ﬁbrous material
in the center; extruded from their ﬂagellar pockets (Stierhof et al.,
1994). These ﬁbers have been puriﬁed and extensively character-
ized by Ilg and colleagues. Filamentous PPG appears to be made
by all species of Leishmania since a large variety of New and Old
World Leishmania species (L. mexicana, several strains of L. major,
L. amazonensis, L. braziliensis, L. aethiopica, L. infantum, and L.
donovani) have been shown to secrete this material in culture (Ilg
et al., 1994, 1996; Stierhof et al., 1994, 1999). It is comprised pre-
dominantly of LPG-like phosphoglycans attached to a serine-rich
protein backbone such that every second amino acid bears a PG
molecule. Glycosylation of fPPG accounts for ∼75% of its total
molecular mass (Ilg, 2000). The PG molecules are formed of three
variably substituted phosphodisaccharides that terminate with a
neutral cap structure. It is this extensive phosphoglycosylation
which inhibits the formation of secondary structures and gives
fPPG its characteristic thread-like appearance. Leptomonad pro-
mastigotes are the main producers of fPPG in sand ﬂies (Rogers
et al., 2002). Filamentous PPG can be detected in L. mexicana or

L. infantum-infected Lu. longipalpis guts from day 2/3 onward,
with a signiﬁcant peak in production from days 5–7 post infec-
tion (Rogers et al., 2002; Gossage et al., 2003; Rogers and Bates,
2007). This corresponds precisely with the peak appearance of
leptomonad promastigotes. These forms are derived from nec-
tomonad promastigotes which migrate to the anterior thoracic
midgut after bloodmeal digestion and defecation. It is here that
leptomonads re-initiate cell division and multiply vigorously in
the gut lumen achieving densities of 1010–1011/ml (Rogers et al.,
2002; Gossage et al., 2003). Within the conﬁnes of this part of
the sand ﬂy gut (∼10 nl) fPPG accumulates and condenses into a
gel-like mass, the PSG (Figure 3). Similarly, fPPG puriﬁed from
culture supernatants forms a gel above 5–10 mg/ml (Ilg et al., 1996;
Stierhof et al., 1999). The concentration of fPPG from a single L.
mexicana-Lu. longipalpis infection is conservatively estimated at
1 g/ml. During the production of the PSG the majority of lep-
tomonads enter metacyclogenesis and differentiate into infective
metacyclic promastigotes (Rogers et al., 2002). The cues which ini-
tiate PSG production remain unknown but metacyclogenesis and
PSG production in sand ﬂies seem inextricably linked.

Herein I will refer to PSG, fPPG, and PPG interchangeably.

PPGs ENABLE SAND FLY COLONIZATION
Within the sand ﬂy, Leishmania need to achieve numerous tasks
in order to have a chance at transmission. They must multiply,
negotiate their way to sand ﬂy’s anterior midgut and mouthparts
and differentiate into the mammal infective form, the metacyclic
promastigote. Along the way Leishmania encounter a number of
barriers to successfully colonize the sand ﬂy. Leishmania need to:
(i) survive hydrolytic attack from the sand ﬂies’ digestive enzymes,
(ii) negotiate their way out of the chitinous peritrophic membrane
that surrounds the bloodmeal, (iii) resist being expelled when the
sand ﬂy defecate their digested bloodmeal, and (iv) survive the
sand ﬂy’s immune response (lectins and antibacterial peptides).
There are a number of PPGs expressed by promastigotes in the
sand ﬂy host (reviewed by Ilg, 2000) and we are just beginning to
realize their diverse roles for the Leishmania-sand ﬂy interaction.
Observations made from sand ﬂy infections using mutant L. major
deﬁcient in LPG (lpg1) or deﬁcient for all surface and secreted PGs
(lpg2) have pointed toward a role for secreted PPGs for the early

The role of proteophosphoglycans in leishmaniasis

FIGURE 3 | The PSG plug. (A) The typical position of Leishmania PSG in the
gut of heavily infected sand ﬂies (FG, foregut; TMG, thoracic midgut; AMG,

survival of promastigotes during bloodmeal digestion (Sacks et al.,
2000; Svárovská et al., 2010). In vitro experiments with promastig-
otes incubated with sand ﬂy midgut lysates prepared at various
times post bloodmeal showed that secreted PPGs confer protec-
tion from enzyme mediated attack (Secundino et al., 2010). In an
elegant series of experiments, Secundino and colleagues showed
that puriﬁed PPG, and not LPG, could passively adhere to the sur-
face of lpg2 parasites to confer this protection. These studies tell us
number of things – ﬁrstly, they show that PPG has the potential to
stick to the surface of promastigotes, which may be relevant dur-
ing the initial stages of mammalian infection; and, secondly, PPGs
have multiple roles for the parasite inside the sand ﬂy. In the future
it will be interesting to investigate the kinetics of PPG production
and its precise interaction with the sand ﬂy. With an expanding
knowledge of sand ﬂy genomics, coupled with the development
of RNAi as a new tool for interrogating sand ﬂy gene function
(Sant’anna et al., 2009; Coutinho-Abreu et al., 2010), studies of
this kind will greatly improve our understanding of sand ﬂies as
vectors of leishmaniasis.

PPGs ALTER SAND FLY FEEDING BEHAVIOR
Sand ﬂies belong to a large group of arthropod vectors known as
pool feeders, which include tsetse ﬂies, black ﬂies, midges, ticks,
and ﬂeas. Sand ﬂies saw into the skin of the mammalian host with
their barbed mouthparts, lacerating dermal capillaries to form a
pool of blood. This is in direct contrast to other vectors such as
mosquitoes which cannulate individual blood vessels, causing less
damage to the skin. Whilst biting, sand ﬂies continuously secrete
their saliva into the wound to keep the blood liquid. They then suck
the blood from the pool into the pharyngeal chamber before it is
pushed through the cardiac or stomodeal valve into the midgut.

Here it is rapidly encapsulated in a peritrophic matrix, allowing
the process of digestion to begin. One of the clearest roles for PPG,
in the form of PSG, in the sand ﬂy vector is its ability to modify its
bloodfeeding behavior for parasite transmission. Since the discov-
ery of sand ﬂies as vectors of leishmaniasis various workers have
observed distinct changes to the behavior of infected sand ﬂies.
Notably, infected sand ﬂies probe more frequently, take longer
to feed, and are more likely to take incomplete meals compared
to their uninfected siblings (Shortt et al., 1931; Killick-Kendrick
et al., 1977; Beach et al., 1985; Rogers et al., 2002; Rogers and
Bates, 2007; Maia et al., 2011). Although the observation that
infected sand ﬂies can experience difﬁculty with feeding is not
new, the connection between this behavior and the likelihood of
increased parasite transmission was not made until the late 1970s
when Killick-Kendrick et al. (1977) re-analyzed the data of Chung
et al. (1951). They showed that Phlebotomus chinensis were more
likely to transmit L. donovani to hamsters when ﬂies probed and
took no blood compared to those infected ﬂies that took a blood-
meal. This demonstrated that Leishmania could manipulate the
feeding ability of the sand ﬂy to promote its own transmission
success.

There are a large number of studies that show that parasites
can manipulate the behavior of their arthropod vectors, but rarely
is a “manipulator molecule” identiﬁed (Rossignol et al., 1984;
Hurd, 2003). In 2002 a clear relationship between the intensity
of Leishmania infection and the feeding ability of sand ﬂies was
established (Rogers et al., 2002). It was found that the major-
ity of heavily infected ﬂies (87%) were only capable of taking a
partial bloodmeal and this was associated with accumulation of
PSG, resulting in a threefold increase in the volume of the ante-
rior midgut and signiﬁcant expansion of the stomodeal valve. In

its quest for transmission, Leishmania can also cause pathology to
the chitin-lined stomodeal valve by attaching to it, through mod-
iﬁcation of their ﬂagellum and the secretion of chitinase (Schlein
et al., 1992; Volf et al., 2004; Rogers et al., 2008). The combination
of these two events results in the blockage of the anterior midgut
with a plug of Leishmania promastigotes and their accompanying
gel, which distends and permanently holds open the eroded valve.
This is hypothesized to adapt the sand ﬂy for efﬁcient transmission
by promoting the reﬂux of parasites during blood feeding and the
deposition of large numbers of infective forms – the “blocked ﬂy
hypothesis” (Shortt and Swaminath, 1928; Figures 3 and 4).

When considering the behavioral manipulation of vectors by
parasites it is important to bear in mind that host contact and
blood feeding do not come without risks and present a consid-
erable danger to both vector and parasites alike when the host
defends itself (Klowden and Lea, 1979; Davies, 1990; Anderson
et al., 2000), so it is possible that these effects alone are not nec-
essarily selectively advantageous. Therefore, the timing of vector
feeding with respect to parasite development is a crucial, since suc-
cessful transmission of parasites requires their vectors to survive
long enough for the parasites to complete their development to an
infective stage (the extrinsic incubation period; Anderson et al.,
1999, 2000; Hurd, 2003; Thomas et al., 2005). In a seminal exper-
iment using the rodent malaria–mosquito model of Plasmodium
yoelii and Anopheles stephensi, Anderson et al. (1999) observed the
bloodfeeding of infected mosquitoes to be more persistent once
the extrinsic incubation period was completed. In such a scenario,
the timing of transmission opportunities is critical in order to
reduce the risk of premature death of the infected vector and pro-
mote its survival long enough to complete the parasite’s extrinsic
incubation period. Feeding persistence is the repetition of feeding
attempts when prevented from feeding, i.e., when a host defends

itself. The biting persistence of a vector to resume feeding after
interruption is considered an important parameter of vectorial
capacity (Koella et al., 1998).

In a comprehensive study of Lu. longipalpis infected with L.
infantum and L. mexicana (natural and experimental combina-
tions, respectively) it was found that interrupted ﬂies were more
persistent in their bloodfeeding (Rogers and Bates, 2007). This
increased in parallel with the development of the parasites, the
number of transmission stages (metacyclic promastigotes), and
the accumulation of fPPG – the main component of PSG. As a
consequence, ﬂies with the highest number of metacyclic pro-
mastigotes were also found to be more likely to initiate a second
feed on naive hosts. The lesions generated from the bites of indi-
vidual L. mexicana-Lu. longipalpis demonstrated that this form
of behavioral manipulation directly resulted in enhanced parasite
transmission. Importantly, these changes to the vector’s behavior
were only seen when the ﬂies were interrupted and infected ﬂies
presented to anesthetized animals usually bit once and fed until
they were engorged. This study conﬁrmed that inﬂuencing a sand
ﬂy’s biting persistence is a developmental strategy for Leishmania
and a form of adaptive manipulation because: (i) it relies on the
successful establishment and development of the parasite within
the sand ﬂy, requiring many intrinsic barriers to be overcome, (ii)
the behavior is only exhibited when the parasite is ready for trans-
mission, (iii) the fPPG gel appears to have arisen independently in
other Leishmania-sand ﬂy combinations, and (iv) the manipula-
tion directly increases the ﬁtness of the parasite through enhanced
transmission.

Previously, it was suggested that the attachment of Leishmania
parasites in contact with the foregut might interfere with the func-
tion of mechanoreceptors that detect blood ﬂow, and this might
explain the reduced ability of ﬂies to take a blood meal (Jenni et al.,

FIGURE 4 | The blocked ﬂy hypothesis and regurgitative model of

shown, scale bar: 1 mm) feed from a pools of blood (in red) in the skin.
(A–D) Represent cross-sections through the sand ﬂy head as it feeds and
show how PSG promotes parasite regurgitation: During feeding, uninfected
sand ﬂies (A,B) draw blood into the pharynx which is diverted into the
midgut through the one-way cibarial or stomodeal valve where it is digested.
In heavily infected sand ﬂies (C,D) Leishmania parasites attach to the valve
and multiply in the anterior midgut. At the same time the parasites secrete
ﬁlamentous proteophosphoglycan (fPPG) which condenses to form the
promastigote secretory gel (PSG – in blue) obstructing the midgut and

pharynx. Gel blockages have been observed in a large number of
Leishmania-sand ﬂy combinations described to date and characterized in
both experimental (L. mexicana in Lu. longipalpis) and natural (L. major in P.
papatasi, L. infantum in Lu. longipalpis) Leishmania-sand ﬂy combinations.
The PSG blockage forces open the cibarial valve allowing parasites and gel to
reach the pharynx and foregut, allowing blood to mix with PSG when it is
taken into the pharynx (C). Since PSG is highly soluble, when blood is
eventually drawn through the parasite-gel obstruction a proportion of midgut
parasites and PSG are regurgitated by backﬂow into the skin of the
vertebrate host (D). Sand ﬂy photo is courtesy of Prof. R.W. Ashford and the

1980; Molyneux and Jefferies, 1986). However, in view of these
results it was proposed that the functioning of these mechanore-
ceptors is impaired by fPPG, which plays the role of manipulator
molecule. This in turn may promote the hunger state and the per-
sistence of the ﬂy, or alternatively, increase the threshold blood
volume at which blood-seeking behavior is inhibited. However,
what we may be seeing is just the tip of the ice-berg; where PSG
may affect many different neuronal, gustatory, endocrine, or even
odor-sensing pathways to inﬂuence bloodfeeding.

One of the next challenges is to investigate whether this manip-
ulation is relevant for transmission in the ﬁeld. It has been
observed for a variety of different Leishmania species in differ-
ent parts of the World that cases of leishmaniasis or Leishmania
seropositivity often cluster at the village and sometimes house-
hold level (Ashford et al., 1992; Evans et al., 1992; Schenkel et al.,
2006; Bousslimi et al., 2010). The risk of Leishmaniasis is com-
monly associated with crowded households and multiple lesions
for particular Leishmania species are not uncommon (Ashford
et al., 1992; Ampuero et al., 2006; Bousslimi et al., 2010; Singh et al.,
2010). Tentatively, these pieces of evidence suggest the behavioral
manipulation of sand ﬂies in action. Recently, a 3 year community
wide study in India and Nepal concluded that insecticide impreg-
nated bed nets do not signiﬁcantly protect against P. argentipes
bites (Gidwani et al., 2011) and visceral leishmaniasis (Picado et al.,
2010). This was surprising because it was assumed that P. argen-
tipes, an indoor, night-biting vector, was an ideal candidate for such
an intervention strategy. This highlights the urgent need to re-
examine and re-evaluate our knowledge of this, and other, impor-
tant Leishmania vectors; particularly their behavior when infected.

PPGs AND THE BLOCKED FLY HYPOTHESIS OF LEISHMANIA
TRANSMISSION
To gain insight into the mechanisms that govern Leishmania infec-
tion in the wild and replicate natural infection more closely in the
lab it is important to understand the context of the infectious bite,
i.e., the site and dose of parasites and the role of molecules egested
from the infected vectors. The site and dose of Leishmania trans-
mission by sand ﬂies is likely to affect the evolution of the disease
(Bretscher et al., 1992; Doherty and Coffman, 1996; Belkaid et al.,
1998). In the vast majority of experimental studies little atten-
tion is given to the kinetics of Leishmania infection by sand ﬂy
bite. Models of cutaneous leishmaniasis mice are typically initi-
ated with large doses of parasites (105–107), derived from in vitro
culture and delivered intradermally or subcutaneously by needle to
the skin (Kimblin et al., 2008). For visceral models of leishmaniasis
the situation is worse, where skin is rarely used as the site of inoc-
ulation. Rather, the sand ﬂy is bypassed entirely and animals are
often infected intravenously or intracardially, with large doses of
amastigotes or axenic promastigotes (Maia et al., 2011). Although
Leishmania are exclusively transmitted by sand ﬂies, studies of
infection from the bites of infected ﬂies are very rare. Neverthe-
less, on the occasions they have been used (Kamhawi et al., 2000;
Rogers et al., 2004, 2006, 2008; Rogers and Bates, 2007; Kimblin
et al., 2008; Maia et al., 2011) they have proved very instructive.

Different approaches have been employed to determine the
dose of Leishmania delivered by sand ﬂies, including: (i) direct

counting of egested parasites following force-feeding with micro-
capillaries (Warburg and Schlein, 1986), or following (chick skin)
membrane feeding (Rogers et al., 2004, 2010), or (ii) indirectly,
through quantitation of Leishmania transcripts from bitten mouse
ears by real time PCR (qPCR; Kimblin et al., 2008; Maia et al.,
2011). Each have their advantages and disadvantages but ulti-
mately information from the number of parasites in bitten skin
using qPCR – a technique that, when optimized, can detect as few
as 10 egested parasites, has provided the most physiologically rele-
vant data to date. Moreover, these types of study have the power to
resolve the variability of individual ﬂy transmission and identify
important features of the infection that may determine of suc-
cessful transmission. In the L. major – P. duboscqi model, it was
demonstrated that the number of promastigotes inoculated by
individual sand ﬂies ranged between 10 and 100,000 Leishmania
(Kimblin et al., 2008). Within this range a bimodal distribution
of parasite delivery was observed, where ∼75% of transmitting
ﬂies delivered fewer than 600 parasites and the rest delivered sig-
niﬁcantly higher doses of more than 1,000 parasites. In another
study that investigated the numbers of L. infantum from single
P. perniciosus and Lu. longipalpis strikingly similar results were
found (Maia et al., 2011). The average dose was 500, with the
majority of transmitting females inoculating less than 600 para-
sites. In this instance there was a signiﬁcant correlation between
the prefeeding infection intensity and the transmitted dose. From
the L. major-P. duboscqi study, high dose transmission also corre-
lated with large midgut infections of over 30,000 promastigotes.
Because of the sensitivity of qPCR and the ability to track the
infection outcome of small groups, or even single infected ﬂies it is
possible to interrogate the data from these experiments to obtain
infection parameters in the ﬂy which successfully predict trans-
mission. Meta-analysis of L. major transmission by groups of four
to ﬁve infected P. duboscqi allowed the authors to show that ﬂies
with ∼70%+ metacyclics in their gut were predictive of successful
transmission to the majority (≥70%) of bitten animals (Stamper
et al., 2011). It was concluded that the rare but high dose trans-
missions probably result from a regurgitation of parasites from
the PSG-blocked midgut. Further corroborating the blocked ﬂy
hypothesis, both transmission studies of L. major and L. infantum
found a strong correlation between the midgut infection intensity
and the ability of the ﬂy to engorge satisfactorily on blood.

As PSG production relies upon metacyclogenesis we hypothe-
sized that the quantity of egested PSG would also correlate with the
size of the sand ﬂy infection. To test this we used capillary feeding
to assess the transmission of L. mexicana from Lu. longipalpis, an
experimental combination which generates generous amounts of
PSG (up to 1 µg/ﬂy) and is highly transmissible to mice (typically
≥85% single infected bites lead to cutaneous lesions; Rogers et al.,
2006, 2008; Rogers and Bates, 2007). Capillary feeding gave ﬁner
control over individual ﬂies, allowing us to standardize the feeding
process. By analyzing the egestate of each ﬂy by semi-quantitative
immunodot-blot we could group them into those that regurgi-
tated high (average± SD: 0.03± 0.06 µg) and low (average± SD:
0.0004± 0.00016 µg) amounts of PSG (Rogers et al., 2009). This
correlated signiﬁcantly with the intensity of their midgut infec-
tions and revealed that sand ﬂies egesting high amounts of PSG
tended to transmit more parasites. These results reinforce the idea

that parasite fPPG can greatly inﬂuence the number of transmitted
parasites and the proportion of co-regurgitated gel. In this regard
it will be worth addressing the role of PSG in determining the par-
asite dose and composition more closely, as it may prove to be a
more accurate predictor of successful transmission and infection.
Ultimately, testing the importance of PSG in transmission would
beneﬁt enormously from a fPPG-deﬁcient parasite line. The main
reason that we don’t have fPPG null mutant is that the gene is too
large for knocking out (∼50kb); but it may be amenable to gene-
disruption. Currently the closest we have come is the generation of
lpg2 null parasites, which lack all phosphoglycans – surface bound
and secreted. Unfortunately, this parasite does not survive past the
bloodmeal phase of development as it is expelled by the sand ﬂy
during defecation (Sacks et al., 2000). I rather suspect that the
same would happen to a fPPG null infection, as it appears that the
gel anchors the infection in the anterior midgut.

Until recently sand ﬂy transmission was regarded as a single
ﬂy activity. A recent study using Lu. longipalpis has challenged
this concept when it was observed that sand ﬂies tended to feed
in aggregates (Tripet et al., 2009). Flies that did so fed more efﬁ-
ciently, obtaining more blood in a faster amount of time compared
to single feeding ﬂies. The authors also noted that aggregated ﬂies
used less of their saliva for feeding and speculated that by shar-
ing resources this may represent a cooperative behavior amongst
sand ﬂies which provides them with numerous ﬁtness gains. Inter-
estingly, the beneﬁt of aggregated feeding was most pronounced
when the ﬂies were offered saliva-immunized mice as a bloodmeal.
In contrast, ﬂies fed singly on immunized mice was detrimental
to the volume of blood taken and the number of eggs generated
(Milleron et al., 2004). In this scenario and ﬂies that aggregate may
be taking advantage of an increased local blood ﬂow to the bite
site caused in part by a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction to
the vector saliva (Belkaid et al., 2000). It would be interesting to
test whether this behavior is affected at different points during the
sand ﬂy infection and the accumulation of PSG, or if transmission
would beneﬁt from the presence of uninfected ﬂies in an aggregate?
I often get asked by colleagues what is the dose of Leishmania
from a sand ﬂy bite? For convenience I tell them the average num-
ber of parasites delivered per bite. For L. mexicana this is currently
1,000; for L. infantum it is 500 and for L. major it is between 500
and 1,000. It is tempting to satisfy ourselves with this reductionist
approach to transmission, however, as discussed above Leishmania
transmission can be highly variable and inﬂuenced directly by the
parasite itself. So perhaps it is more pertinent to think in terms of
how many parasites is a ﬂy capable of delivering, or likely to deliver
during feeding? Undoubtedly, information like this will eventually
have to take into account the development of the parasite, and the
secretion of fPPG, which can inﬂuence the feeding behavior of the
sand ﬂy and the parasite dose.

PPGs ENHANCE LEISHMANIA INFECTION OF THE
MAMMALIAN HOST
Needle injection of Leishmania metacyclic promastigotes with
sand ﬂy saliva does not faithfully reproduce the effects of infected
sand ﬂy bite, and discrepancies in epidermal cytokine responses
(in particular, the Th2-driving cytokines IL-4 and IL-5) have been
reported (Kamhawi et al., 2000). This indicates that in addition

to saliva other sand ﬂy factors affect immune responses to Leish-
mania. From our work there appeared to be a convincing role for
PSG in the blocked ﬂy and regurgitative mode of transmission. In
2004 we took this one step further and asked whether the regur-
gitated PSG could actively inﬂuence the Leishmania infection in
the mammalian host? From membrane feeding experiments, using
groups of L. mexicana-infected Lu. longipalpis, we found that PSG
was actively egested by infected ﬂies (Rogers et al., 2004). Co-
infection experiments in mice using the physiologically relevant
dose of 1,000 metacyclic promastigotes we showed conclusively
that PSG could potently exacerbate cutaneous L. mexicana infec-
tion (Rogers et al., 2004) and enhance its transmission back to ﬂies
(unpublished results). This effect was observed both in terms of
parasite lesion evolution (lesions were faster to appear than the
controls and grew larger) and ﬁnal amastigote burden. Strikingly,
this effect was evident in both Leishmania-resistant (CBA/Ca) and
Leishmania-susceptible (BALB/c) strains of mice. Furthermore,
in healer CBA/Ca mice we found PSG to enhance the chronic-
ity of L. mexicana infection. Using this infection model we have
since found that PSG can beneﬁt L. mexicana over a wide range
of doses (10–10,000), hinting that it is important to the parasite
irrespective of the bloodfeeding attempt – i.e., it may be able to
exacerbate infections from those ﬂies that just probe or from those
that feed for longer and take a full bloodmeal (Rogers et al., 2009).
The component of PSG responsible for promoting leishmania-
sis was identiﬁed as glycans donated from fPPG, the scaffold of
the gel (Rogers et al., 2004). Curiously, in combination with the
saliva from the vector, another important component of trans-
mission, the disease enhancing properties of PSG is reduced but
the net result is still beneﬁcial to the parasite. Recently we have
established a role for PSG for infection with a number of other
Leishmania species (Table 1), including L. infantum, the agent of
zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in South America (Rogers et al.,
2010). For this parasite it was interesting to observe that the com-
bination of PSG and Lu. longipalpis saliva was additive in their
ability to PSG enhanced both the skin and visceral phase of infec-
tion depending on dose. In addition, we have observed a role for
PSG for L. major, L. tropica, and L. braziliensis infections (unpub-
lished results), demonstrating that it is likely to be important for
a wide range of Leishmania species, from natural or experimental
parasite-vector combinations.

During the ﬁrst few days of infection the parasite is most vul-
nerable to the potent innate immune responses of the host to the
sand ﬂy bite. This is exaggerated for sand ﬂies since they inﬂict
more damage to the skin – by lacerating the capillary loops of the
upper dermis with their serrated proboscis to feed from a pool
of blood. This means that the PSG and vector saliva operate in a
wound environment. In this context, we found that PSG was able
to strongly inﬂuence neutrophil and macrophage recruitment, and
worked in alliance with saliva (Rogers et al., 2009). This effect was
and was observable by 4 h in mouse dermal air pouches. Since neu-
trophils and macrophages host Leishmania (Sacks and Kamhawi,
2001; Peters et al., 2008) the sand ﬂy bite, saliva, and parasite PSG
work synergistically to provide more potential host cells to the site
of infection.

Next, we found that the presence of PSG with macrophages,
in vitro or in vivo, beneﬁted infection, irrespective of the activation

status of the cell. Potentially, this allows Leishmania to survive in
hostile environments such as inﬂamed skin exposed to the bites
of the vector or immunized with its saliva. It appears that PSG
reduces the efﬁciency of parasite elimination in inﬂammatory
macrophages (M1 or classically activated macrophages – CAMΦ).
In these cells l-arginine is catabolized by nitric oxide synthase
2, also known as inducible nitric oxide synthase, (NOS2/iNOS) to
generate nitric oxide (NO), which mediates one of the most potent
killing mechanisms of intracellular Leishmania parasites (Bogdan,
2001). Nitric oxide synthase 2 is expressed in vivo in the early phase
of infection (Stenger et al., 1996) when macrophages respond to
innate recognition pathways and the activation of toll like receptors
(TLRs; Kropf et al., 2004). It has been shown that NOS2 expres-
sion can be suppressed in vitro by the saliva of sand ﬂies, including
Lu. longipalpis (Hall and Titus, 1995). In our hands, Lu. longipalpis
saliva did not inﬂuence NO generation or the course of L. mexicana
infection in vitro. Furthermore, L. mexicana PSG, either alone or in
combination with sand ﬂy saliva, did not inﬂuence NO production
directly. Instead, we found that PSG enhanced the alternative acti-
vation of macrophages, by increasing their arginase-1 expression
and activity (Rogers et al., 2009). Therefore, PSG may compete
with NOS2 for l-arginine, indirectly reducing NO production.

Leishmania have developed numerous strategies to prevent
immune elimination. One such mechanism targets the l-arginine
metabolism of macrophages (Figure 5). Macrophages can either
kill or host intracellular amastigote forms of Leishmania depend-
ing on the balance of two inducible enzymes, nitric oxide synthase
2 (NOS2/iNOS; Wei et al., 1995) and arginase-1 (Kropf et al., 2005)
which share the same substrate, l-arginine and are controlled by
the environmental balance of Th1/pro-inﬂammatory (e.g., IFNγ,
TNFα) and Th2/anti-inﬂammatory (e.g., IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, IL-
21) cytokines (Figure 5A). Increased arginase is associated with
resistance to worm infections, allergic conditions such as asthma

and Th2 induced pathologies (Tominaga, 1989; Kropf et al., 2004;
Schleicher et al., 2007; Whitaker et al., 2008). Th1 cytokines
induce classical activation of macrophages (CAMΦ), upregulat-
ing iNOS which catabolizes l-arginine into the Leishmania-toxic
metabolite nitric oxide (NO). Th2 cytokines alternatively activate
macrophages (AAMΦ) and induce arginase-1 which hydrolyzes
l-arginine into urea and l-ornithine; the latter being the ﬁrst
building block for the synthesis of polyamines. Polyamines are
small cationic molecules required for cell growth, wound heal-
ing, homeostasis, and are essential for intra-macrophage growth
of Leishmania (Kropf et al., 2005).

Since PSG can also promote the chronicity of cutaneous leish-
maniasis in “healer” strains of mice there may be a potent effect
on the adaptive immune response to these parasites. In humans
it is generally accepted that immunosuppression is a common
feature of non-healing cutaneous leishmaniasis (Bomﬁm et al.,
1996) and visceral leishmaniasis (Ho et al., 1983; Sacks et al.,
1987; Nylen and Sacks, 2007). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
from these patients typically have an impaired ability to prolifer-
ate, produce IFNγ or are anergic to antigen restimulation (Ho
et al., 1983; Barral et al., 1986; Sacks et al., 1987; Nylen and
Sacks, 2007). Similarly, studies of mouse T cell function recov-
ered ex vivo from the site of cutaneous leishmaniasis show similar
immune hyporesponsiveness (Rodriguez et al., 2002, 2003, 2004,
2007; Bronte and Zanovello, 2005; Munder et al., 2005, 2006;
Kropf et al., 2007). From murine models of cutaneous leishmani-
asis it is now becoming clear that Leishmania additionally beneﬁt
from a high accumulation of AAMΦ in cutaneous lesions via
their high demand for, and local depletion of, l-arginine in the
microenvironment (Figure 5B). In contrast to macrophages, T
lymphocytes are acutely sensitive to l-arginine starvation (Choi
et al., 2009); rapidly becoming hyporesponsive to antigen stimu-
lation and exhibiting impaired proliferation, cytokine secretion,

FIGURE 5 | Arginine and Leishmania survival. (A) L-arginine can have a
direct inﬂuence on Leishmania intra-macrophage survival. L-arginine can
inﬂuence the macrophage’s ability to host or kill Leishmania, depending on
the cytokine milieu they are exposed to. In the classically activated state,
macrophages can metabolize L-arginine into nitric oxide (NO) when they
perceive Th1 cytokines or pro-inﬂammatory mediators. Nitric oxide is
potently toxic to Leishmania amastigotes. In direct contrast, alternatively
activated macrophages can catabolise L-arginine into polyamines when
they experience Th2 cytokines/anti-inﬂammatory mediators. Polyamines
are an essential food source for intracellular amastigotes. Promastigote
secretory gel appears to promote the alternative activation of
macrophages, corrupting them into “superfeeders” for the parasites they

host (NOS2, nitric oxide synthase 2; OH-arg, naturally occurring
endogenous inhibitor of arginase; nor-NOHA, selective competitive
arginase inhibitor). (B) L-arginine can also inﬂuence the adaptive immune
response indirectly by affecting T cell function. T cell proliferation, T cell
receptor signaling, and cytokine secretion are acutely responsive to the
levels of extracellular L-arginine. Within cutaneous Leishmania lesions of
mice the accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages leads to the
depletion of extracellular L-arginine. As a consequence, T cell function is
severely impaired, and the long-term survival of the parasites enhanced. A
role for PSG in this model of immunopathology for leishmaniasis has yet to
be determined but is speculated to occur. The ﬁgures are after Kropf et al.
(2005) and Müller et al. (2009).

The role of proteophosphoglycans in leishmaniasis

CD3ζ T cell receptor chain expression, and T cell receptor signal-
ing. For experimental L. major infection of BALB/c and CBA/Ca
mice, by needle inoculation, it has been show that these two mech-
anisms contribute toward uncontrolled growth of parasites within
the cutaneous lesion (Modolell et al., 2009; Munder et al., 2009).
Speciﬁcally, uncontrolled replication of L. major in BALB/c mice
correlated with abnormally high levels of arginase activity, a reduc-
tion in local l-arginine levels and a local suppression of CD4+
T cell responses within the lesion and not at the draining lymph
node. Along with questions regarding the quantity and persistence
of PSG in skin, how relevant this model is for natural infection by
sand ﬂy bite still remains to be addressed. Moreover, in humans
modulation of l-arginine in the microenvironment is more likely
to come from the action of neutrophils and not macrophages
(Rotondo et al., 2011; Sippel et al., 2011). Arginase released by
degranulating activated or dying neutrophils can bind to and
sequester l-arginine, reducing its bioavailability (Müller et al.,
2009 and references therein). Since we now know that neutrophils
transiently host Leishmania until macrophages arrive (Peters et al.,
2008), investigating the interaction between PSG and neutrophils
may prove very revealing for the earliest stages of infection.

The other major component of Leishmania transmission is
sand ﬂy saliva. This is essential for efﬁcient bloodfeeding for the
sand ﬂy by promoting blood ﬂow to the bite site and by modulating
the immune response to the bite. Not surprisingly therefore, these
factors also play important roles in the establishment of Leishma-
nia infection. Injection of P. papatasi salivary gland sonicates can
induce a rapid expression of IL-4 from mouse epidermal cells and
Lu. longipalpis saliva can induce IL-10 expression from mouse ear
tissue and cultured macrophages (Mbow et al., 1998; Norsworthy
et al., 2004; Monteiro et al., 2007). Both these cytokines syner-
gize in the alternative activation of macrophages, the expression
of arginase in macrophages and the promotion of parasite growth
(Kropf et al., 2005). Despite this, saliva and PSG did not act addi-
tively on macrophage arginase activity or parasitism, reﬂecting
previous infections in mice (Rogers et al., 2004). Recently, it has
been shown that cytokine-dependent, STAT 6-dependent path-
ways as well as TLR-dependent, STAT 6 independent pathways
can induce arginase-1 in macrophages depending on the type
of infection (El Kasmi et al., 2008). Indeed, it has been shown
that increased Leishmania survival in TLR4-deﬁcient host cells
correlates with enhanced arginase activity (Kropf et al., 2004).
Furthermore, the disparity in the cytokine responses invoked by
the injection of salivary gland sonicate with Leishmania (Belkaid
et al., 1998) and infected sand ﬂy bite (Kamhawi et al., 2000) may
be due to the unaccounted presence of PSG in the latter; suggesting
that PSG and sand ﬂy saliva may indeed act via different pathways
or cytokines.

It has been shown that resistance of mice to L. major infec-
tion was associated with high collagen deposition and a faster rate
of wound healing, controlled in part by three leishmaniasis sus-
ceptibility loci mapped to chromosome 17 (Sakthianandeswaren
et al., 2005). However, it has also been established experimen-
tally in mice that L. amazonensis can readily metastasize to a fresh
skin cut (Bertho et al., 1994) and clinical cases of new cutaneous
Leishmania lesions following local trauma to the skin has been
recorded (Wortmann et al., 2000 and references therein), therefore,

our understanding of leishmaniasis and the wound response is less
than complete. The inﬂuence of PSG strongly suggests that Leish-
mania can modulate the early wound healing process. Wound
healing, however, is a highly complex and dynamic process involv-
ing many cell types, so for the future it would be important to
dissect further the inﬂuence of PSG on the wound healing process
itself. Collectively, these data suggest that Leishmania, through
secretion of PSG, has evolved mechanisms to modulate both the
wound healing process and the adaptive immune response to
ensure its own survival and transmission.

THE USE OF SAND FLIES IN LEISHMANIA RESEARCH
We and others have shown that sand ﬂies generate inocula and
immune responses that are qualitatively very different from sim-
ply injecting parasites by needle. Throughout this review I have
taken care to highlight the research involving natural and experi-
mental Leishmania-sand ﬂy combinations. In an ideal World every
Leishmania research lab would have their own sand ﬂy colony per-
tinent to the species of parasite they worked on; however, there are
very good reasons why one may favor particular sand ﬂy species
over another. According to their vectorial capacity, sand ﬂies can
be broadly categorized into “restrictive vectors” – which sustain
the development of only one Leishmania species (e.g., L. major in
P. papatasi, L. tropica in P. sergenti) or “permissive vectors” – which
can host a wide range of Leishmania species until maturity (e.g.,
Lu. Longipalpis, P. argentipes; Myskova et al., 2007). Understand-
ably, many labs favor the use of permissive vectors, or a mixture of
permissive and restrictive species.

When studying transmission and infection by ﬂy bite, hav-
ing the natural Leishmania-sand ﬂy combination may have added
beneﬁt. For example, the morphology of that particular sand ﬂy
may inﬂuence the ability of the ﬂy to bloodfeed or transmit, as
dimensions in mouthparts or cibarial armature can be strikingly
different. The microﬂora of the sand ﬂy gut may also have an as yet
undeﬁned role to play in Leishmania colonization of their vector,
or transmission and infection of the mammalian host itself. More
directly however, is the composition or quantity of the sand ﬂy
saliva as this may have speciﬁc interactions with the parasite PSG
and/or the host’s skin that may inﬂuence the infection.

Rearing, maintaining, infecting, and manipulating sand ﬂies
is hard to do. It is time consuming and labor intensive, requir-
ing considerable experience, expertise, and resources. Therefore,
the practicality of doing Leishmania-sand ﬂy research, particularly
transmission work, is such that some parasite-vector combinations
are favored over others. Some sand ﬂies are easier to rear than oth-
ers, for example, Lu. Longipalpis is a sand ﬂy that can be reared
in relatively large numbers – although this is still far from trivial.
Similarly, one may opt to use certain sand ﬂies for other biological
traits such as their ability to bite experimental animals, to survive
egg laying, and re-feed when infectious (e.g., P. duboscqi vs. P. pap-
atasi) – all of which can dictate the feasibility an experiment. From
the perspective of PSG, although its role in infection appears to
be relevant to many Leishmania species transmitted from natural
or unnatural sand ﬂy hosts, we favor L. mexicana in Lu. Longi-
palpis, an experimental combination, as our workhorse model
because it generates large infections and efﬁciently transmits to
mice. Personally, I do not see that using experimental Leishmania-

The role of proteophosphoglycans in leishmaniasis

sand ﬂy combinations should be a barrier to Leishmania research.
Quite the opposite, I feel that they can offer good models for
exploring new hypotheses regarding transmission or the biology
of the parasite-vector interaction. However, when researchers wish
to extrapolate their lab experiments to the situation in the ﬁeld,
and comment on the epidemiology of speciﬁc leishmaniases, then
it would be advisable to use relevant combinations. Having said
that, for the reasons given above it is not always possible to do so.
At the end of the day transmission by bite, irrespective of the sand
ﬂy used, can still be very revealing if it is interpreted correctly.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
There is still much to learn about leishmaniasis by studying nat-
ural infection by sand ﬂy bite. Leishmania PPGs and PSG are an
important part of Leishmania transmission and infection, how-
ever, its presence is largely ignored (Costa et al., 2011). There is an
urgent need for Leishmania vaccines and the earliest opportunity

is to interrupt mammalian infection immediately following an
infected bite, whilst the parasites are establishing infection in the
skin. Despite the generation of numerous experimental formula-
tions only two have been tested against infected sand ﬂy bite and in
both cases radically different outcomes to needle-based challenge
were observed (Rogers et al., 2006; Peters et al., 2009). Because
of the uniqueness of sand ﬂy transmission more effort should be
made to use sand ﬂies as vectors of leishmaniasis and not rely
entirely on needles for parasite delivery (Costa et al., 2011).

An old English proverb says that, “a hungry ﬂy bites sore” (Hey-
wood, 1562). Given the profound role of PPGs and PSG for
Leishmania transmission this is certainly true for infected sand
ﬂies.
