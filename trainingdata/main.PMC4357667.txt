Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 1  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics  www.elsevier.com/locate/gpb  www.sciencedirect.com  EDITORIAL  GPB at 10  Jun Yu*  Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China  The arrival of 2013 marked the 10th anniversary of Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics   GPB.
According to our outline [1], we have been improving GPB with visible benchmarks and events.
First, the numbers of sub- missions and published articles have both reached the highest in the history of GPB.
Second, a special issue on microRNAs was successfully edited by our board members Tongbin Li and William Cho (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/ 16720229/10/5).
Third, editorial board members have been encouraged to be more actively involved in the journal opera- tion.
Most of the submissions are now handled by editorial board members for an initial screen, followed immediately by an in-depth review that is roughly half of the original sub- missions, and such a thrifty relay shortens the process signiﬁ- cantly.
Fourth, we started to provide Articles in Press service since (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/ journal/aip/16720229), and the accepted articles reach readers before printing.
Fifth, efforts have been made to promote journal awareness and readership by exhibition at meetings and recruiting new reviewers and editors, especially from the countries where we do not have editors and reviewers previ- ously.
Sixth, we held a formal gathering of the GPB editorial board members in Beijing last December during a genomics meeting.
Finally, we would like to proudly announce that GPB was elected to be one of The Excellent International Impact Academic Journals of China (Science/Technology/ Medicine) (EII-CAJ), ranked the 4th among 175 journals in this category (http://www.hii.cnki.net/cajz/topmag.aspx page =1&tabid=3#tab).

At age 10, GPB still has a lot of room to become even better and competitive in a faster pace.
First, GPB s Open-Access ofﬁcially began in 2013.
To celebrate this, we organized a special issue in which all submissions are from our board mem- bers, and an open invitation for editing special topics is valid through all this year.
In the 3rd issue of the year, we will have another special issue on Gene Regulatory Network organized by Roger Patient and Matt Loose (http://www.journals.else- vier.com/genomics-proteomics-and-bioinformatics/call-for-pa- pers/special-issue-on-gene-regulatory-network/).
The third special issues on Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) will be organized by Qi Zhou (http://www.journals.elsevier.com/ genomics-proteomics-and-bioinformatics/call-for-papers/ special-issue-on-induced-pluripotent-stem-cells/).
Second, we are organizing the 3rd International Conference of Genomics in Qingdao, China, this fall.
An editorial board meeting of GPB will be held at the same time.
This conference will cover the topics related to genome sequencing and analysis, as well as genome technology and applications.
GPB will host a spe- cial collection of this conference.
Looking forward to meeting you in Qingdao and seeing your articles published by GPB!
As a ﬁnal note, we would like to express our appreciation for the great support of our board members and to expect more in 2013.
We would like to thank our reviewers for their time and effort by publishing a list of reviewers who provided manuscript review for GPB in 2012.
Of course, the last but not the least, we would like thank all our authors for choosing GPB to publish their works.
We are sure that GPB will grow better with supports from all of you.
Again, let s Go Publish- ing Better!
