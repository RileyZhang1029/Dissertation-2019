For reverse genetic approaches inactivation or selective modiﬁcation of genes are required
to elucidate their putative function. Sulfolobus acidocaldarius is a thermoacidophilic Cre-
narchaeon which grows optimally at 76°C and pH 3. As many antibiotics do not withstand
these conditions the development of a genetic system in this organism is dependent on
auxotrophies. Therefore we constructed a pyrE deletion mutant of S. acidocaldarius wild
type strain DSM639 missing 322 bp called MW001. Using this strain as the starting point,
we describe here different methods using single as well as double crossover events to
obtain markerless deletion mutants, tag genes genomically and ectopically integrate for-
eign DNA into MW001. These methods enable us to construct single, double, and triple
deletions strains that can still be complemented with the pRN1 based expression vector.
Taken together we have developed a versatile and robust genetic tool box for the crenar-
chaeote S. acidocaldarius that will promote the study of unknown gene functions in this
organism and makes it a suitable host for synthetic biology approaches.

INTRODUCTION
In contrast to the bacterial domain, research on Archaea has long
been hampered by the absence of genetic tools to study gene
functions in vivo. One major reason for this was that archaea
are resistant to most commonly used antibiotics that are used
in microbial genetics as selectable markers (Leigh et al., 2011).
These compounds very often target the peptidoglycan synthesis
which is absent in most archaea (Albers and Meyer, 2011) or the
antibiotics are readily degraded at the conditions at which various
archaea live.

Genetic

systems were described for haloarchaea

and
methanogens only in the late 1990s, respectively, and have con-
stantly improved since then (Leigh et al., 2011). For another
euryarchaeon Thermococcus kodakariaensis an effective gene dele-
tion system was established by Sato et al. (2003, 2005) for which
also a complementary expression vector has been optimized (San-
tangelo et al., 2008). The most recent system was developed for
Pyrocococus furiosus. Hence, nowadays genetic toolboxes exist for
a variety of euryarchaeota (Waege et al., 2010).

In the kingdom crenarchaeota, only for organisms of the order
Sulfolobales genetic systems have been developed. Sulfolobales
are thermoacidophilic microorganisms that grow optimally at
temperatures around 80˚C and pH values between 2.5 and 3.5.
Since the ﬁrst description of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius by Brock
et al. (1972), members of the Sulfolobales have developed into
model organisms for studying DNA transcription, replication,
translation, DNA repair, RNA processing, and cell division. More-
over, most Sulfolobales possess the non-phosphorylated Entner–
Douderoff pathway and its regulation upon temperature shifts
was the topic of a systems biology approach (Albers et al., 2009).
This initiative has led to the development of standard operating

procedures for omics approaches in Sulfolobales and should facil-
itate the exchange and comparability of obtained data (Zaparty
et al., 2009).

The ﬁrst shuttle vectors and a gene deletion method in S. sol-
fataricus were based on the β-galactosidase, LacS, as a selection
marker (Worthington et al., 2003; Aucelli et al., 2006; Berkner et al.,
2007) and this method was successfully employed in a number of
studies (Schelert et al., 2004, 2006; Szabo et al., 2007; Zolghadr
et al., 2007; Frols et al., 2008; Maaty et al., 2009). However, as the
selection is based on minimal media containing only lactose as a
carbon source, this method is quite tedious as Sulfolobus species do
not grow well on sugar minimal media. In some archaeal genetic
systems the complementation of uracil auxotrophic mutants by the
pyrEF genes is used on uracil free media to obtain gene deletion
mutants. This marker also enables for the use of 5-ﬂuoroorotic
acid (5-FOA), which can be employed as counter selection marker
for constructing markerless deletion mutants. For S. islandicus a
system for obtaining unmarked deletion mutants relying on the
pyrEF selection including a shuttle vector has been established
(Deng et al., 2009; Peng et al., 2009) and successfully used in dif-
ferent studies (Zhang et al., 2010; Gudbergsdottir et al., 2011).
Other Sulfolobus shuttle vectors that rely on pyrEF selection were
constructed based on the virus SSV1 and the plasmid pRN1
(Jonuscheit et al., 2003; Berkner et al., 2007). For S. islandicus it has
furthermore been shown recently that the drug simvastatin can be
used to select for the presence of plasmids in a host that overex-
presses the hmg gene, encoding the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A (HMG-CoA; Zheng et al., 2012).

Recently, we employed pyrEF as a selectable marker to obtain
insertional deletion mutants in S. acidocaldarius and moreover
for persistence of a shuttle vector with an inducible promoter

for expression (Wagner et al., 2009; Berkner et al., 2010). It was
earlier demonstrated that S. acidocaldarius can efﬁciently recom-
bine primers down to a length of 14 bp into its genome (Grogan
and Stengel, 2008). Taking advantage of this ability Grogan and
colleagues showed very recently that short ﬂanking regions of
only 40–50 bp incorporated into the 5’ end of primers led to site-
speciﬁc integration of the obtained PCR products containing pyrE
as a selectable marker into the S. acidocaldarius genome (Sakof-
sky et al., 2011). This method has been used in high-through put
screens especially in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and opens these pos-
sibilities now for S. acidocaldarius. However, these methods lead
to the consumption of the only available marker and therefore
abolish the possibility of complementation in trans and also the
construction of double or triple gene mutants.

Therefore we established different efﬁcient methods to obtain
unmarked deletion mutants in S. acidocaldarius relying on uracil
auxotrophy as a selectable marker using the pop in/pop out
method. These methods were employed for genomically tagging
of genes enabling pull down experiments for studies on pro-
tein complexes. In addition, an ABC transporter of S. solfataricus
was ectopically inserted into the upsE locus of S. acidocaldarius.
Moreover, we present the use of a copper inducible promoter for
homologous and heterologous production of proteins. Summa-
rizing, we present here a versatile and complete genetic toolbox
for S. acidocaldarius.

RESULTS
CONSTRUCTION OF MW001
Several different auxotrophic mutants of S. acidocaldarius were
published before. However, quite a few of these were obtained by
UV mutagenesis (Grogan, 1991). Therefore the possibility existed
that these mutants would also contain secondary mutations in
their genomes. For that reason a new directed S. acidocaldar-
ius pyrE deletion mutant was constructed. This mutant, dubbed
MW001, was obtained by transforming the S. acidocaldarius wild
type strain DSM639 with a PCR product that contained 930–
1500 bp of the up- and downstream ﬂanking regions of the pyrE
gene (saci1597 ), which would delete the full length pyrE gene
by homologous recombination. After transformation the cells
were streaked on gelrite plates containing uracil and 5-FOA. Sur-
prisingly, none of the obtained colonies exhibited the expected
complete deletion of the pyrE gene, but only a deletion of 322 bp
(91–412 bp). This phenomenon happened repeatedly and this
particular deletion has also been isolated before (Grogan and
Hansen, 2003). The deletion of the 322 bp in pyrE in MW001
was conﬁrmed by PCR (Figure 1B) and sequencing. Growth of
MW001 in medium containing NZ-amine medium was only pos-
sible upon the addition of uracil and was completely restored at a
concentration of 10 μg/ml uracil (Figure 1A).

IN-FRAME UNMARKED DELETION MUTANTS
We employed three different methods
to obtain in-frame
unmarked deletion mutants in S. acidocaldarius MW001. The
ﬁrst method is based on the classical “pop in/pop out” scheme
using a single crossover recombination step (see Figure 2A). We
designed pSVA406 for this purpose, which contained the pyrEF
cassette of S. solfataricus (pyrEFSSO) and a multiple cloning site

upstream of it, which was used to insert the approximately 500 bp
long up- and downstream ﬂanking regions of the gene of inter-
est. The obtained deletion mutant plasmid was methylated and
100 ng plasmid DNA was electroporated into MW001. Cells were
streaked on ﬁrst selection plates that contained no uracil to select
for the cells that would integrate the plasmid into their genome
via a single crossover (Figure 2A). To enforce the “pop out” by
a second single crossover recombination event, cells were then
streaked on second selection plates that contained 5-FOA as only
pyrEF - cells are resistant to 5-FOA. This second single crossover
recombination step will either produce the wild type situation or
the expected deletion mutant (Figure 2A). The method is here
illustrated by deleting upsE (saci1494). In the last screening step
we obtained in 50% of the colonies the wild type situation and
50% of analysed colonies we got the expected in-frame deletion
mutants (Figure 3A). As upsE is part of the UV inducible pili
operon in S. acidocaldarius which encodes proteins that after UV
induction mediate cellular aggregation (Ajon et al., 2011), we con-
ﬁrmed that the obtained ΔupsE strain could indeed not aggregate
anymore upon UV treatment (Figure 3B). The correctness of the
obtained deletion mutants was conﬁrmed by sequencing of PCR
products that were achieved by using primers that were at least
200 bp up and downstream located to the primers used to con-
struct the ﬂanking regions for the deletion plasmid. This deletion
method has been successfully used to produce single gene deletion
mutants (Ellen et al., 2011; Meyer et al., 2011), and also double
and triple deletion mutants as the marker cassette can be reused
as often as wanted (Henche et al., 2012; Lassak et al., 2012). These
mutants have also been successfully complemented by expression
vectors.

To improve the deletion mutant procedure we introduced
the reporter gene lacS that encodes a β-galactosidase from S.

in-frame mutants. (A) Plasmid pSVA406 integrates via single crossover into
the genome and by addition of 5-FOA it can be selected for a second single
crossover event that leads either to the wild type situation or the aimed add
deletion mutant. (B) By using pSVA407 deletion mutants can be obtained via
the same method as employed by pSVA406, only that pSVA407 contains the
lacS gene in the selection cassette that allows for the easy identiﬁcation of

integrants at the ﬁrst selection level. (C) pSVA431 allows for double crossover
insertion via the sequence of the gene and a downstream region of the gene
of interest of the selection cassette. Thereby positives clones should be
staining blue. Upon selection on 5-FOA plates the selection cassette will be
excised and positive deletion mutants should be white. Goi, gene of interest;

solfataricus into pSVA406 yielding the deletion mutant plas-
mid pSVA407 (Figure 2B). Cells expressing lacS turn blue
when sprayed with substrates like X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-
indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside), therefore integrants could be
easily detected on the ﬁrst selection plate. Figure 3C shows an
example of such a plate, also demonstrating that most of the
growing colonies were lacS positives.

Furthermore, we developed a third method which yields mark-
erless deletion mutants via double crossover events. The deletion
mutant plasmid pSVA431 consists of the pyrEFSSO marker cas-
sette together with lacS reporter cassette that are ﬂanked by two
different multiple cloning sites. The ﬁrst multiple cloning site har-
bors an approximately 500 bp part of the gene of interest and in
the second multiple cloning site the up and downstream ﬂanking
regions were placed consecutively (Figure 2C). This cassette was
transformed as a linear fragment into MW001. As the absence of
uracil on the ﬁrst selection plates selects for colonies containing
the pyrEFSSO cassette, cells will only be able to form colonies when
they integrate the linear fragment with double crossover via the
matching part of the gene and the downstream ﬂanking part of the
gene (Figure 2C). Therefore all obtained colonies on ﬁrst selection
plates by means of this method turned blue after X-gal spraying
(data not shown). When these strains were streaked on second
selection plates containing 5-FOA and uracil, only the cells that
loop the pyrEFSSO cassette and the lacS gene via a single crossover
of the upstream ﬂanking region out, can form colonies. Conse-
quently, all white colonies that grow on second selection plates are
deletion mutants (Figure 3D, right half of the gel). One further
advantage of this method is that the genotype of integrants still

harbors the functional full length gene of interest. If via this tech-
nique no colonies can be obtained on second selection plates or if
the obtained colonies stay blue after X-gal spraying (which would
mean that point mutations in the pyrEFSSO cassette occurred), the
target gene can be considered essential for growth under these
conditions.

ECTOPIC INTEGRATION OF FOREIGN DNA INTO THE S.
ACIDOCALDARIUS MUTANT
To demonstrate that we can introduce ectopically DNA sequences
into the S. acidocaldarius genome, we introduced the glucose
transporter of S. solfataricus (sso2847-sso2850; glcS,T,U, and V,
respectively, see Figure 4A; Albers et al., 1999) into the upsE locus
(saci1494) of MW001. To this end plasmid pSVA445 was con-
structed containing the whole glucose transporter under the con-
trol of the maltose inducible promoter of malE (saci1665; Berkner
et al., 2010) and the ﬂanking regions that matched the sequence
of upsE. pSVA445 was methylated and transformed linearized into
MW001. Cells were plated on ﬁrst selection plates. Colonies that
had integrated pSVA445 were streaked on second selection plates.
Obtained colonies were screened for positive clones that would
have integrated the glucose transporter cassette of 4700 bp (glc
transporter with promoter; 4450 bp only transporter; 6220 bp glc
transporter together with pyrEF marker; data not shown) under
the control of the maltose promoter. Successful production of the
glucose transporter from the S. acidocaldarius genome was tested
by analyzing wild type cells and the insertion mutant by western
blot analysis using antibodies against GlcV, encoded by the last
gene of the glucose transporter operon. As shown in Figure 4B,

2073/2015 on either MW001 or any of the ΔupsE mutants. (B) As upsE is
part of the pili operon that leads to aggregation of UV treated S.
acidocaldarius cells (Ajon et al., 2011), an aggregation assay was performed
with all the ΔupsE deletion mutants that were either obtained using

pSVA406, pSVA407, or pSVA431. A typical result of an UV induced aggregation
assay is shown. Aggregation of wild type and deletion mutant were scored
before (gray bar) or after UV treatment (black bar). (C) First selection plate
colonies from a pSVA407 transformation was sprayed with X-gal. (D) A typical
result of a mutant PCR screen with primers 2073/2015 using either plasmid
pSVA406 or pSVA431 to obtain the deletion mutant.

GlcV was detected in the membrane fraction of the insertion
mutant, showing that the mal promoter upstream of glcS was
sufﬁcient to drive expression of the whole ABC transporter operon.

GENOMICALLY TAGGING OF PROTEINS
To enable tag based afﬁnity puriﬁcation of homologously pro-
duced proteins and identiﬁcation of native protein complexes, we
used the “pSVA406” method (Figure 2A) to add tags to genes of
interest in the genomic context that encoded for, e.g., His- or One-
Strep-tags. Two examples will be discussed here, the puriﬁcation
of AglB (Saci_1274), a multiple spanning membrane protein, and
of Saci_1210, a cytosolic protein. AglB was tagged in the genome
by constructing plasmid pSVA1252 that contained the C-terminal
part of aglB in which the stop codon was exchanged by a One-
Strep-tag coding sequence and the downstream part of aglB. Using
the pop in/pop out method the tag was inserted into the genome of
MW001 and correct insertion was veriﬁed by sequencing MW001
saci1274::saci1274-One-Strep. This strain was grown and cells
processed as described in Section “Materials and Methods.” Sol-
ubilized membrane proteins were subjected to Strep-tag afﬁnity
chromatography and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotted with Streptactin antibodies (Figures 5A,B).

The puriﬁed AglB-One-Strep appeared fuzzy, most probably as
it is glycosylated, but its identity was conﬁrmed by mass spec-
trometry. Two other proteins were co-puriﬁed that were identiﬁed
as Saci_0260 and Saci_0262, subunits of the pyruvate carboxylase.
These two proteins seem to be biotinylated proteins that bind to the
chromatography material. The same proteins have been observed
during Strep afﬁnity puriﬁcations from cell extracts from S. solfa-
taricus (Albers et al., 2006). Binding of these two proteins can be
avoided by the addition of avidin to the cytoplasmic fraction.

In contrast to AglB, Saci_1210 was tagged with a tandem tag
containing a Strep and a 6xHis-tag. This enabled us to test puriﬁ-
cation by either Strep- or His afﬁnity chromatography using the
same strain. Strep afﬁnity chromatography of Saci_1210-Strep/His
resulted in the same two contamination bands seen also in the AglB
puriﬁcation and no detectable Saci_1210 (data not shown). His-
tag afﬁnity chromatography resulted in highly pure Saci_1210-
Strep/His in one step (Figures 5C,D). However, in contrast to
S. solfataricus S. acidocaldarius exhibits a 14.7 kDa hypothetical
protein, Saci_0386, that contains a natural stretch of six histidine
residues at the C-terminus and therefore this protein co-puriﬁes
during His afﬁnity chromatography (not shown in this blot).
Concluding, His-tag afﬁnity chromatography seems to be better

INDUCIBLE PROMOTERS
Several promoters have already been tested for efﬁcient produc-
tion of proteins in S. acidocaldarius of which the maltose inducible
promoter of the maltose binding protein (saci1165) turned out to
be the most reliable one (Berkner et al., 2010; Meyer et al., 2011;
Henche et al., 2012; Lassak et al., 2012). Still this promoter exhibits

quite some basic expression even under non-induced conditions.
As a possible alternative we examined the copper inducible pro-
moter of the copper inducible copper resistance cassette (saci0874–
saci0872) that encodes CopT, the regulator of the operon, CopM,
a metallochaperon, and CopA, a P-type copper ATPase (Ettema
et al., 2006; Figure 6A). On the one hand CopT was described
to be a negative regulator (Ettema et al., 2006) and on the other
hand in a recent study (Villafane et al., 2011) CopT (called CopR
in that publication) was described to be an activator of the cop
operon. Therefore, the mal promoter of pCmalLacS was replaced

respectively). (D) Speciﬁc LacS activity by induction of PcopMA with

with the copMA promoter region together with copT (highlighted
in Figure 6A by a gray line, plasmids are schematically shown in
Figure 6B). Hence, LacS expression would be driven by the copMA
promoter (Figure 6A). The regulatory gene copT was included to
ensure correct repression/activation of the copMA promoter.

The pSVA1673 was transformed into MW001 which was grown
in medium supplemented with a minimal trace element solution to
ensure very low levels of copper. The basic levels of expression were
half of that obtained by the mal promoter under comparable con-
ditions (Figure 6C). However, the induction of the promoter was
only 1.4 fold after 4 h at a copper concentration of 1 mM whereas
the maltose promoter was induced up to 1.8 fold. The copper pro-
moter could be induced gradually by varying the amount of copper
present in the medium (Figure 6D). Copper concentrations higher
than 2 mM were not suitable because of cell lysis.

DISCUSSION
Detailed in vivo studies were long hampered in archaea as the
development of genetic systems was very often obstructed by the
absence of plasmids or selection markers. However, in the last

few years enormous progress has been made and for most of
the archaeal model systems genetic tools now exist (Leigh et al.,
2011). Especially in the Sulfolobales genetic systems have been
developed. For S. solfataricus and S. islandicus, respectively (Wor-
thington et al., 2003; Albers and Driessen, 2008; She et al., 2009)
these are proven to be successful as work based on them has been
published.

Here we present a complete and versatile genetic system for
S. acidocaldarius. Our system advances the system developed by
Grogan that is based on marker insertion into the target gene
(Sakofsky et al., 2011), to a system in which the selection marker
can be reused. This therefore enables us to construct multiple allele
mutants (single, double, and triple), speciﬁcally mutate genes in
the genomic background or tag proteins genomically and com-
plement obtained mutants by using an expression vector. In this
manuscript we showed exemplary three different methods that can
be employed to obtain markerless deletion mutants. We have used
the same method for different projects in which we deleted target
genes, constructed single, double, and triple mutants and comple-
mented these using the pCmal based vector system (Berkner et al.,

2007; Ajon et al., 2011; Meyer et al., 2011; Henche et al., 2012;
Lassak et al., 2012).

We have also experienced that some genes could not be deleted
by the pop in/pop out method, but we were able to obtain a dele-
tion mutant by the PCR based insertion method (Sakofsky et al.,
2011). This might be due to regulatory elements that might be
disturbed by the insertion method. Therefore both methods can
and should be used complementary.

We demonstrated that we can genomically tag genes in cis which
will facilitate protein complex isolation and testing protein trun-
cates or point mutations in their original genomic neighborhood.
For afﬁnity puriﬁcation of such tagged proteins, His-tag afﬁn-
ity chromatography in our experience yielded better puriﬁcation
results, which could of course be due to a better accessible tag as
the His-tag was located at the outmost C-terminus of the protein
whereas the Strep-tag might have been occluded. However, His-
tag afﬁnity puriﬁcation only yields one co purifying impurity. In
the future other tags as, e.g., FLAG and HA tag will be tested to
expand the genetic tool box.

Moreover, we introduced a ∼5 kB ABC transporter operon
from S. solfataricus into the S. acidocaldarius genome and could
demonstrate that the last gene was transcribed and translated cor-
rectly. This opens the option of integrating large sequences into the
S. acidocaldarius genome and therefore streamlines its application
in synthetic biology approaches.

For the expression in S. acidocaldarius we also tested the cop-
per inducible copMA promoter, which showed decreased basic
expression levels in comparison to the maltose inducible promoter.
Therefore the copMA promoter might be useful for production of
toxic proteins in S. acidocaldarius, especially regarding that the
expression levels can be tightly titrated by the amount of copper
added to the medium.

Concluding, we present here a very robust and versatile genetic
tool box for S. acidocaldarius that has already proven to be widely
applicable and very useful in delineating gene functions in this
organism. We are currently working on the development of addi-
tional selective markers and the optimization of the expression
vector.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STRAINS AND GROWTH CONDITIONS
Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639, MW001, and all constructed
deletion mutants were aerobically grown in Brock media (Brock
et al., 1972) with a pH of 3 at 76˚C. The media were supple-
mented with 0.1% (w/v) tryptone or with 0.1% (w/v) N-Z-Amine
and 0.2% dextrine. The growth of the cells was monitored by
measurement of the optical density at 600 nm.

For pouring Sulfolobus plates a two times concentrated Brock
media was supplemented with 6 mM CaCl2 and 20 mM MgCl2.
For ﬁrst selection plates 0.2% NZ-Amine (Fluka) and 0.4% dex-
trin, for second selection plates 0.2% tryptone, 0.4% dextrin,
200 μg/ml 5-FOA, and 20 μg/ml uracil was added to the two
times concentrated solution and prewarmed to 75˚C. This solu-
tion was mixed with an equal volume of fresh boiling 1.4% Gelrite
solution (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and poured in 40 ml
portions into petri dishes (150× 20 mm, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht,
Germany).

CONSTRUCTION OF DELETION MUTANT PLASMIDS
To obtain an uracil auxotrophic mutant of S. acidocaldarius DSM
639 deletion plasmid pSVA402 was constructed. To this end the up-
and downstream regions of pyrE (saci1597 ) were ampliﬁed using
primers 390/916 and 917/920, respectively. An overlap extension
PCR was performed with both PCR products and the resulting
pyrE deletion fragment was blunt end cloned into pGEM-T Easy
(Promega, Mannheim, Germany) yielding pSVA402.

For the construction of the deletion plasmid pSVA406 the pyrEF
(sso0615–sso0616) cassette of S. solfataricus together with its own
promoter region was ampliﬁed using primers 938 and 939 (primer
sequences available in the Appendix). This marker cassette was
cloned into the MluI NsiI site of the recirculated pGEM-T Easy
vector. Primer 938 contained additional BamHI and AvrII sites to
expand the multiple cloning site of the resulting plasmid.

For construction of the deletion plasmid pSVA407 the lacS
(sso3019) gene of S. solfataricus, encoding a β-galactosidase, was
ampliﬁed with primers 933 and 940 and fused to the maltose
inducible promoter of the maltose binding protein (saci1165) of
S. acidocaldarius, which was ampliﬁed with primers 937 and 932,
via overlap extension PCR. The resulting reporter cassette was
cloned into the NsiI site of pSVA407. A correctly oriented clone
was identiﬁed by restriction analysis.

The deletion plasmid pSVA431 was constructed by amplify-
ing the pyrEF (sso0615–sso0616) and lacS (sso3019) cassette of S.
solfataricus from pSVA407 using primer 939 and 1072. The result-
ing marker – reporter cassette was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy
vector. The pSVA431 exhibited two multiple cloning sites up and
downstream to the marker – reporter cassette, respectively.

For the construction of the upsE (saci1949) deletion plasmids
via single crossover event the upstream region of upsE was ampli-
ﬁed with the primers 2010 and 2011 and the downstream region
was ampliﬁed with the primers 2012 and 2013. With both PCR
products an overlap extension PCR was performed and cloned
into the ApaI BamHI sites of pSVA406 and pSVA407 leading to
the plasmids pSVA1804 and pSVA447. For the construction of the
upsE deletion plasmid via double crossover the upsE gene was
ampliﬁed with primers 532 and 639. The resulting PCR product
was cloned into the BamHI and Pst I site of the MCSI of pSVA431.
A PCR was performed on pSVA1804 with the outer primers 2264
and 2265 to introduce different restriction sites and cloned into
the NcoI and KpnI site of MCSII.

For the construction of the ectopic integration plasmid of the
S. solfataricus glucose transporter into S. acidocaldarius pSVA445
the upsE (saci1949) upstream region was ampliﬁed using primers
2256 and 2257. The promoter region together with the signal
sequence of the maltose binding protein (saci1165) was ampli-
ﬁed employing primers 2258 and 986. glcS (sso2847) without
signal sequence was ampliﬁed using the primers 987 and 988.
glcT (sso2848), glcU (sso2849), and glcV (sso2850) were ampli-
ﬁed in a single PCR with the primers 989 and 2259. The pyrEF
marker cassette of S. solfataricus was ampliﬁed with the primers
2260 and 2261 and for the ampliﬁcation of the upsE downstream
region the primers 2262 and 2263 were used. All six PCR products
were mixed together to perform an overlap extension PCR. The
resulting PCR product was blunt end cloned into pGEM-T Easy
following the standard protocol yielding pSVA445.

To simplify the puriﬁcation of saci1274 by afﬁnity chromatog-
raphy, a One-Strep-tag was fused to this gene in the genome. For
the construction of the insertion plasmid 900–1000 bp fragments
of the up- and downstream regions of saci1274 were PCR ampli-
ﬁed. For the upstream region the forward primer introduced an
ApaI restriction site at the 5
end, whereas the reversed primer
was designed to incorporate the One-Strep-tag sequence in front
of the Stop codon (primers 1818 and 1819, respectively). For
the downstream fragment the forward primer 1820 was designed
to incorporate the complementary strand of the One-Strep-Tag,
while the reverse primer 1821 contained a BamHI restriction site.
Both fragments were fused via an overlapping PCR and the ampli-
ﬁed PCR fragment was digested with ApaI and BamHI and ligated
into plasmid pSVA407 yielding plasmid pSVA1224. The correct
sequence was conﬁrmed by sequencing. To increase the accessi-
bility of the One-Strep-tag a longer linker sequence was added
leading to the One-Strep sequence that was synthesized with a
ﬂanking 5
Pst I restriction site (sequence present in
Figure A1 in Appendix). The product was digested with AccI and
Pst I and ligated into the plasmid pSVA1224, predigested with the
same restriction enzymes, yielding the plasmid pSVA1252. Trans-
formation and selection of the mutant strain was performed as
described above.

To obtain genomically His-tagged saci1210 primers 1583 and
3106 were used to amplify the gene together with the C-terminal
tag (Strep/His-tag). For the downstream region ampliﬁcation with
the primers 3107 and 1578 resulted in a PCR product with over-
lapping regions to the gene together with the tag. The overlap
extension PCR product was cloned into the NcoI, BamHI site of
pSVA406 yielding plasmid pSVA1097.

For the construction of copper inducible expression plasmid
the promoter region of copM (saci0873) was ampliﬁed together
with the predicted regulator copT (saci0874) with the primers
3428 and 3429. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the
SacII, NcoI site of pCMalLacS which led to an exchange of the
maltose inducible promoter of the maltose binding protein with
the copper inducible promoter together with its regulator yielding
pSVA1673.

PREPARING COMPETENT MW001 CELLS
Sulfolobus acidocaldarius MW001 were grown in 50 ml Brock
media supplemented with 0.1% NZ-Amine, 0.2% sucrose, and
20 μg/ml uracil and adjusted to pH 3 with sulfuric acid. When
the culture reached an OD600 nm of 0.5–0.7 (exponential growth
phase) an aliquot was transferred to 400 ml fresh medium and har-
vested at an OD600 nm of 0.2–0.3. The culture was cooled down on
ice, then centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 g and washed twice with
250 ml ice cold 20 mM sucrose. The pellet was resuspended with
ice cold 20 mM sucrose to a theoretical ﬁnal OD600 nm of 10 and
aliquotted in 50 μl portions. The aliquots were directly used for
transformation or frozen at −80˚C without using liquid nitrogen
for storage.

TRANSFORMATION OF PLASMIDS INTO S. ACIDOCALDARIUS
Prior to transformation into S. acidocaldarius, suicide- and shut-
tle plasmids were methylated to prevent restriction by the SuaI
restriction enzyme. For that purpose E. coli ER1821 (New England

Biolabs) bearing the additional plasmid pM.EsaBC4I (New
England Biolabs, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) was transformed
with plasmid DNAs.

Methylated deletion plasmids were electroporated in electro-
competent wild type cells MW001 using a Gene Pulser Xcell
(BioRad, München, Germany) with a constant time protocol with
input parameters 1.5 kV, 25 μF, 600 Ω in 1 mm cuvettes. Before
plating on uracil lacking and NZ-Amine containing plates, cells
were regenerated for 30 min at 75˚C in two-fold recovery solu-
tion (1% sucrose, 20 mM β-alanine, 1.5 mM malate buffer, pH 4.5,
10 mM MgSO4). The plates were sealed in plastic bags to avoid
drying-out and incubated for around seven days at 75˚C.

COLONY PCR OF S. ACIDOCALDARIUS
Single colonies appearing on plates were analyzed by colony PCR.
To that end, single colonies were picked and lysed in 30 μl 0.2 M
NaOH and the solution neutralized with 70 μl 0.2 M Tris pH 7.8.
To amplify the genomic region of interest 0.5 μl lysate was used in
30 μl PCR reactions using Phusion High-Fidelity polymerase with
Phusion HF buffer and monitored on an agarose gel.

BLUE–WHITE SCREENING
Integration of pSVA407 or pSVA431 constructs could be visualized
by X-Gal spraying of cells using a 25 mg/ml X-Gal stock solution
in DMF diluted 1:5 with water. The 5 mg/ml X-Gal solution was
sprayed on plates when single colonies appeared after around one
week and the plates were directly put back into the 75˚C incuba-
tor for 30 min. Transformants on ﬁrst selection plates and point
mutants on second selection plates turned blue while deletion
mutants on second selection plates stayed white.

PURIFICATION OF SACI1274-ONE-STrEP
Ten liter culture of the strain MW001 Saci1274::Saci1274-One-
Strep was grown in Brock medium until an OD of 0.8. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation (3000 g ; 4˚C; 20 min). The cell pel-
let was resuspended in 40 ml buffer A (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM
Tris HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) and lysed by a 20 min soniﬁca-
tion with an intensity of 60% and an interval 20 s (Bandelin
Sonopuls). Unbroken cells were removed by a low spin centrifu-
gation 3000 g at 4˚C for 20 min. The supernatant was centrifuged
at 120,000 g at 4˚C for 45 min and the membrane pellet resus-
pended in 12 ml of buffer A. 6 ml of the membrane fraction
solubilized at 42˚C under shaking condition in 30 ml Buffer S (2%
n-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside (DDM), 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris
HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) supplemented with PMSF. Undissolved
membranes were pelleted by an ultracentrifugation (120,000 g ;
4˚C for 45 min). The supernatant was added twice to a 0.8 ml
STREP-Tag column (Strep-Tactin®Superﬂow®, IBA, Goettingen,
Germany). Before loading the column was equilibrated with 10×
column volume of buffer E (0.05% DDM, 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM
Tris HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) and after the loading of the super-
natant washed with 15× column volumes of the same buffer.
The fusion protein was eluted with the buffer E containing 1 mM
desthiobiotin.

Puriﬁcation of Saci-Strep/His was performed with the differ-
ence that the cytoplasm was used for puriﬁcation. For His afﬁnity
chromatography His-SELECT material from Sigma was used.

WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS
From each puriﬁcation step 30 μl samples were loaded on a 11%
SDS-PAGE and run at 100 V. Transfer to a PVDF membrane
and blotting were performed as commonly done. The gener-
ated chemiﬂuorescence of the Precision StrepTactin-AP Conju-
gate antibody (Biorad) or His-AP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was
measured in a Fujiﬁlm LAS-4000 Luminescent image analyzer
(Fujiﬁlm, Duesseldorf, Germany).

PROMOTER ACTIVITY ASSAY
For the promoter activity assay pSVA1673 and pCmalLacS were
transformed into MW001. Single colonies containing pCmalLacs
were inoculated in Brock Medium with 0.1% NZ-Amine and
0.2% sucrose whereas pSVA1673 containing cells were grown in
Brock medium supplemented with 0.2% maltose and 0.2% xylose.
Moreover, for these cells the trace element solution only con-
tained Na2B4O7 and MnCl2. For induction, 0.4% maltose or 1 mM
CuSO4 were added to the medium, respectively.

Promoter activity was analysed by measuring the cleavage of
o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranosid (ONPG) by LacS of S. solfa-
taricus as described in Lassak et al. (2012). All given strains were
assayed in biological as well as technical triplicates. The produc-
tion of ONP was measured at 410 nm over a period of 4 h at 42˚C
using an Inﬁnite 200 luminometer (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzer-
land). Miller units were calculated as described previously (Lassak
et al., 2012). With respect to the temperature optimum of LacS a
conversion factor FT= 7 was determined and included in the ﬁnal
equation.
