 Abstract: Studies on Rhizobium-legume symbiosis show that trehalose content in nodules under drought stress correlates 
positively with an increase  in plant  tolerance to this stress. Fewer  reports describe trehalose  accumulation in mycorrhiza 
where,  in  contrast  with  rhizobia,  there  is  no  flux  of  carbohydrates  from  the  microsymbiont  to  the  plant.  However,  the  
trehalose dynamics in the Mycorrhiza-Rhizobium-Legume tripartite symbiosis is unknown. The present study explores the 
role  of  this  tripartite  symbiosis  in  the  trehalose  content  of  nodules  grown  under  contrasting  moisture  conditions.  Three 
wild genotypes  (P.  filiformis, P. acutifolis  and P.  vulgaris)  and two commercial genotypes of Phaseolus vulgaris  (Pinto 
villa and Flor de Mayo) were used. Co-inoculation treatments were conducted with Glomus intraradices and a mixture of 
seven native rhizobial strains,  and trehalose  content was determined by GC/MS. The results showed a negative effect of 
mycorrhizal  inoculation  on  nodule  development,  as  mycorrhized  plants  showed  fewer  nodules  and  lower  nodule  dry 
weight compared to plants inoculated only with Rhizobium. Mycorrhizal colonization was also higher in plants inoculated 
only with Glomus  as  compared  to plants  co-inoculated with both  microsymbionts.  In  regard  to trehalose,  co-inoculation 
negatively  affects  its  accumulation  in  the  nodules  of  each  genotype  tested.  However,  the  correlation  analysis  showed  a 
significantly positive correlation between mycorrhizal colonization and nodule trehalose content.

INTRODUCTION 

  Common  beans  represent  the  most  important  source  of 
dietary protein in developing countries. However, in most of 
these  countries,  its  cropping  has  been  relegated  to  marginal 
production  areas,  characterized  for  their  poorly  developed 
soils and low nutrient content. Generally speaking, beans are 
sown  under  rainfed  systems  which  expose  the  plant  to  vari-
able  periods  of  drought.  In  this  regard,  an  important  effort 
has been made to produce common bean cultivars tolerant to 
these  challenging  conditions.  An  agronomic  practice  associ-
ated with increased yield in these systems is inoculation with 
Rhizobium.  This  type  of  inoculation  improves  not  only  the 
nutritional  status  of  nodulated  plants,  derived  from  the  bio-
logical  nitrogen  fixation  (BNF)  process,  but  recently  it  has 
been  recognized  that  this  inoculation  may  also  increase 
drought  or  osmotic  tolerance  of  nodulated  legumes  such  
as  acacia,  common  bean,  lotus,  and  medicago,  through  the

biosynthesis  of  trehalose  ((cid:1)-D-glucopyranosyl-[1-1]-(cid:1)-D- 
glucopyranoside)  [1-4].  The  accumulation  of  trehalose  by 
different  organisms  (bacteria,  yeast,  fungi,  nematodes,  etc.) 
has  been  related  to  survival  under  different  environmental 
stresses,  like  osmotic,  low  pH,  high  and  low  temperatures 
and dehydration [5-7]. In the nodule, disaccharide is synthe-
sized  by  the  bacteroid,  and  its  accumulation  depends  on  the 
rhizobial  strain,  legume  genotype  and  environmental  condi-
tions [8]. It was reported that under well-watered conditions, 
there is a basal amount of trehalose in the nodules, having a 
negative correlation with the BNF, but under drought condi-
tions,  nodule  trehalose  levels  increase  significantly  and  may 
contribute  to  maintain  BNF  under  these  circumstances  [2] 
and  to  improve  the  plant  tolerance  to  drought  [2,  8].  Under 
field conditions, it was observed that trehalose is detected in 
seeds from nodulated plants, with a positive correlation with 
seed longevity [9]. 

 
It  has  been  reported  that  mycorrhizal  inoculation  in-
creases  the  plant’s  tolerance  to  drought.  The  most  accepted 
mechanism  for  this  effect  is  the  improvement  of  water-use 
efficiency  of  the  mycorrhized  plant  [10-13].  Interestingly,  it 
is  also  known  that  ecto  and  endo  mycorrhizae  synthesize 
trehalose  [14,  15].  Nevertheless,  in  this  case,  it  was  demon-

strated  trough  the  use  of  14C  that  there  is  no  carbohydrate 
flux  from  the  fungi  to  the  plant  [16],  and  fungi  trehalose  is 
mostly  localized  at  the  spores  where  it  may  serve,  as  in 
Trichoderma and  Aspergillus, to  increase  the  survival of the 
spores 17-18]. In a recent in vitro study, it was observed that 
mycorrhizal  roots  under  osmotic  stress  mobilized  trehalose 
from  the  mycorrhizal  root  to  the  external  mycelia  (Farias-
Rodriguez, unpublished data), supporting the idea that treha-
lose  biosynthesis  in  mycorrhizal  symbiosis  is  only  localized 
in fungal tissues and does not contribute to plant stress toler-
ance as in Rhizobium.  

 
In  the  case  of  co-inoculation  (rhizobia  and  mycorrhiza) 
experiments  on  legumes,  most  of  the  reports  argue  for  a  
synergistic  effect  of  both  microsymbionts  on  plant  develop- 
ment  [19].  However,  in  common  bean,  examples  in  the  
literature  show  a  negative  effect  of  mycorrhiza  on  nodule  
development  [20].  The  objective  of  this  work  was  to  study  
the  effect  of  mycorrhiza  inoculation  on  trehalose  accumula- 
tion in the nodule. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Biological Material 

  The  common  bean  genotypes  used  here  were  the  wild 
accessions  Phaseolus  filiformis  P1535309,  P.  acutifolius 
G40142 and P. vulgaris  P1325687, and the  commercial  cul-
tivars P  vulgaris  cv.  Pinto  Villa  and P.  vulgaris  cv.  Flor  de 
Mayo.  The  seeds  were  donated  by  Jorge  Acosta  Gallegos 
from INIFAP-Celaya. 

  Glomus  intraradices  spores  were  donated  by  Javier  Vil-
legas from IIQB-UMSNH and maintained at (cid:1)70°C in a 50% 
glycerol  solution. The Rhizobium strains used (Fcin1, Fcin2, 
Fcin3,  Fcin4,  Fcin5,  Fcin6,  and  Fcin7)  were  isolated  in  a 
previous  experiment  [9].  Stock  cultures  were  maintained  at 
(cid:1)70°C in PY medium (in g L(cid:1)1: yeast extract 3, CaCl2 • 2H2O 1, 
casein peptone 5), containing 50% (v/v) glycerol. 

Inoculation Treatment 

 
Seeds  were  surface  disinfected  with  2.5  M  NaOCl  for  5 
min  and  rinsed  with  sterile  distilled  water  before  use.  Three 
inoculation  treatments  were  imposed  as  follows:  a)  Rhizo-
bium inoculation was performed by soaking the seeds for 1 h 
in a mixture of native rhizobial strains prepared as described 
by  Altamirano-Hernandez  et  al.  [9];  b)  Glomus  inoculation 
was  performed  during  sowing  by  adding  to  each  seed  1  mL 
of  a  Glomus  spore  suspension  (30  spores  mL-1);  c)  co-
inoculation was performed by first  inoculating Rhizobium  as 
described  previously,  then  1  mL  of  a Glomus  spore  suspen-
sion  was  added  to  each  seed  during  sowing.  Control  plants 
were not inoculated, instead they were watered with a Jensen 
solution  (in  g  L-1:  1  Ca(H2PO4)2.H2O,  0.2  K2HPO4,  0.2 
MgSO4.7H2O, 0.2 NaCl, 0.1  FeCl2.4H2O, and 1 mL of min-
eral  solution  [2.86  boric  acid,  0.22  ZnSO4.7H2O,  1,81 
MnCl2.7H2O, 0.09 K2MoO4]) containing 0.05% KNO3. 

Drought Stress 

 
Plants  from  different  inoculation  treatments  (previously 
described) were watered every three days, and once a week a 
Jensen  solution  was  used.  Drought  stress  was  imposed  on 
plants at the flowering stage (R7) by suspending watering for 

Ballesteros-Almanza et al. 

16  days.  At  the  end  of  this  period,  plant  total  biomass  and 
leaf  area  were  recorded.  From  the  Rhizobium  and  co-
inoculation  treatments,  nodules  were  harvested  by  hand  and 
nodule number and dry weight were measured. 

  Root  samples  were  collected  from  co-inoculated  and 
Glomus-inoculated  plants  to  measure  mycorrhizal  coloniza-
tion. 

Trehalose Analysis 

  Nodule  trehalose  was  extracted  by  grinding  the  nodules 
in  boiling  80%  (v/v)  ethanol  and  evaporated  to  dryness  be-
fore resuspension in 1 mL of 80% (v/v) ethanol. Aliquots of 
100  μL  from  each  sample  were  derivatized  to  obtain  the  al-
donitrile peracetylated forms of the sugars, 25 μg of perseitol 
were  added  as  internal  standard,  and  then  analyzed  by  gas 
chromatography–mass  spectrometry  (HP6850-HP5973)  on 
an HP-5 MS column (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) 
as described by Macias-Rodriguez et al. [21]. 

RESULTS 

Nodulation Parameters 

 
In  general  terms,  it  was  observed  that  co-inoculation  of 
Glomus  and  Rhizobium  in  bean  plants  had  a  negative  effect 
on  nodulation  parameters  (Figs.  1  and  2).  In  this  sense,  the 
wild  accession  of P.  vulgaris  P1325687  showed  the  highest 
number of nodules under both watering regimes and inocula-
tion  treatments.  In  the  well-watered  treatment  (Fig.  1a),  P. 
vulgaris  P1325687  presented  on  average  500  nodules  per 
plant  when  inoculated  only  with  the  rhizobial  mixture,  but 
when  co-inoculated  with  Glomus,  the  number  of  nodules  in 
this  bean  genotype  significantly  decreased  (p<0.05)  to  an 
average  of  300  per  plant.  The  commercial P.  vulgaris  geno-
types (Flor de Mayo and Pinto Saltillo) inoculated only with 
Rhizobium  presented  65  nodules  per  plant  on  average,  but 
when  co-inoculated  with  Glomus,  the  number  of  nodules 
decreased to 45. P. filiformis and P. acutifolius showed a low 
number of nodules, with an average of 12 nodules per plant; 
under  co-inoculation  they  showed  an  average  of  7  nodules 
per plant. 

  When  drought  was  imposed  on  these  bean  plants,  the 
number  of  nodules  decreased  in  the  two  inoculation  treat-
ments  when  compared  with  their  well-watered  counterparts 
(Fig.  1b).  P.  vulgaris  P1325687  had  350  nodules  per  plant 
when  inoculated  with  Rhizobium,  and  only  100  when  co-
inoculated  with  Glomus.  Under  watering  conditions,  there 
was a significant difference among the two commercial bean 
cultivars. P. vulgaris cv. Flor the Mayo presented 45 nodules 
when  inoculated  with  Rhizobium  and  35  when  the  mycor-
rhiza  was  co-inoculated.  Interestingly,  P.  vulgaris  cv.  Pinto 
Saltillo  had  10  nodules  when  inoculated  only  with  Rhizo-
bium  and  40  when  the  mycorrhiza  was  co-inoculated.  This 
was the only case recorded in this work in which the number 
of nodules increased with Glomus inoculation. In contrast, P. 
filiformis  and  P.  acutifolius  had  10  nodules  with  rhizobial 
inoculation  and  4  with  co-inoculation  under  this  drought 
treatment. 

  Variability  in  the  dry  weight  of  nodules  among  the  dif-
ferent  bean  genotypes  was  lower  as  compared  to  that  re-
corded for the total number of nodules (Figs. 1 and 2). Under

well-watered  conditions  (Fig.  2a),  when  plants  were  inocu-
lated  with  the  rhizobial  mixture,  P.  acutifolius  showed  the 
largest  nodules,  with  an  average  dry  weight  of  0.55  mg  
nodule-1. P. vulgaris P1325687 nodules weighed 0.43 mg on 
average. The last three genotypes had on average nodules of 
0.21  mg.  Under  the  co-inoculation  treatment,  the  weight  
of  nodules  significantly  (p<0.05)  decreased  in  P.  vulgaris 
P1325687  (0.35  mg  nodule-1),  P.  acutifolius  (0.23  mg  
nodule-1) and P. vulgaris cv. Pinto Saltillo (0.15 mg nodule-1). 

  Nodule  weight  decreased  under  drought  condition  (Fig. 
2b). As in well-watered plants, P. acutifolius had  the largest 
nodules when inoculated only with Rhizobium, with an aver-
age dry weight of 0.38 mg nodule-1, followed by P. vulgaris 
P1325687 with 0.30 mg nodule-1. The smallest nodules were 
reordered in P. vulgaris cv. Pinto Saltillo with an average of 
0.10  mg  nodule-1.  When  these  bean  genotypes  were  co-
inoculated  with  Glomus,  nodule  weight  decreased  signifi-
cantly  (p<0.05)  in  all  genotypes,  with  a  maximum  value  of 

0.19 mg nodule-1 in P. vulgaris P1325687, and a minimum of 
0.1 mg nodule-1 in P. acutifolius. In contrast, P. vulgaris  cv. 
Pinto Saltillo nodules showed significant (p<0.05) increases, 
with 0.16 mg nodule-1. 

Nodule Trehalose Content 

  The effect of mycorrhizal co-inoculation on nodule treha-
lose content is shown in Table 1. Mycorrhizal co-inoculation 
caused  a  decrease  in  trehalose  content  of  nodules.  Under 
well-watered  condition,  in  plants  inoculated  only  with 
Rhizobium, the average trehalose content in the nodules was 
36 mg g-1, the highest value corresponded to P. filiformis (50 
mg  g-1),  and  the  lowest  to  P.  vulgaris  cv  Flor  de  Mayo  (20 
mg  g-1).  In  the  co-inoculation  treatment,  the  average  nodule 
trehalose  content  of  these  five  genotypes  significantly 
(p<0.05)  decreased  to  16  mg  g-1,  the  maximum  value  of  25 
mg g-1 corresponding to P. filiformis and the minimum of 10 
mg g-1 to P. acutifolius and P. vulgaris cv. Flor de Mayo.

  Under  drought  stress,  trehalose  content  of  nodules  sig-
nificantly  (p<0.05)  increased  in  both  inoculation  treatments 
in  comparison  to  their  well-watered  counterparts.  The  
average  nodule  trehalose  content  for  the  five  genotypes  
with  Rhizobium  inoculation  in  this  water  regime  was  of  
67  mg  g-1.  The  highest  trehalose  content  was  recorded  in 
nodules of P. vulgaris P1325687 (90 mg g-1), and the lowest 

in  P.  vulgaris  cv.  Flor  de  Mayo  (45  mg  g-1).  In  the  
co-inoculation  treatment,  the  trehalose  content  of  nodules 
significantly  (p<0.05)  decreases  in  all  genotypes,  with  an 
average  value  of  31  mg  g-1.  The  maximum  trehalose  value 
corresponded to P. filiformis (40 mg g-1) and the minimum to 
P. vulgaris cv. Flor de Mayo (18 mg g-1).

Mycorrhizal Colonization 

  To  better  understand  the  negative  effect  of  Glomus  in-
oculation  on  the  nodule  parameters  described  previously, 
mycorrhizal  colonization  was  recorded  and  the  results  are 
shown  in  Fig.  (3).  Interestingly,  mycorrhizal  colonization 
was  higher  when  the  plants  were  only  inoculated  with 
Glomus  in  all  genotypes  evaluated,  and  decreased  when  the 
co-inoculation  Glomus-Rhizobium  was  performed.  Under 
well-watered  conditions,  mycorrhizal  colonization  among 
the five evaluated bean genotypes was quite uniform, with an 
average  colonization  of  22%.  The  maximum  value  was  
recorded  for  P.  vulgaris  cv.  Pinto  Saltillo  (27%)  and  the 
minimum  for  P.  vulgaris  cv.  Flor  de  Mayo  (15%).  When  
co-inoculated  with  Rhizobium,  mycorrhizal  colonization  
decreased to an average of 15%. The highest value was 18% 
for  P.  filiformis  and  P.  vulgaris  P1325687,  and  the  lowest 
value was 10% for P. vulgaris cv. Flor de Mayo.  

  Under drought stress it was observed that, as opposed to 
nodulation,  mycorrhizal  colonization  increased,  with  an  av-
erage value of 37%. P. filiformis showed the highest coloni-
zation with 50%, while P. vulgaris cv. Flor de Mayo showed 
the  lowest  with  10%.  In  the  co-inoculation  treatment, 
Glomus  colonization  significantly  (p<0.05)  decreased,  as 
occurred  under  well-watered  conditions,  with  an  average  of 
21%,  the  maximum  value  being  for  P.  filiformis  (35%)  and 
the minimum for P. vulgaris cv. Flor de Mayo (5%). 

Correlation Between Nodulation and Mycorrhization 

  When  a  correlation  analysis  was  performed  to  evaluate 
the  effect  of  mycorrhiza  on  nodule  parameters,  it  was  inter-
esting  to  observe  that  under  well  watered  conditions,  com-
paring  data  from  the  five  bean  genotypes,  the  correlation 
indices  showed  a  positive  relationship  between  Glomus 
colonization  and  nodulation  (although  it  wasn’t  statistically

significant).  This  would  indicate  that  bean  genotypes  that 
have  the  highest  mycorrhizal  colonization  showed  the  high-
est  number  of  nodules,  nodule  dry  weight  and  nodule  treha-
lose content (Fig. 4a), regardless of the fact that individually, 
in  each  genotype  mycorrhizae  decreased  the  values  of  these 
parameters. The correlation index values for Glomus coloni-
zation were r=0.38 for nodule number, r=0.63 for nodule dry 
weight,  and  r=  0.48  for  trehalose  content.  However,  under 
drought  conditions,  some  changes  were  observed  in  these 
correlations  indices  (Fig. 4b).  The  number  of  nodules  had  a 
negative  correlation  with  mycorrhization  (r=0.15).  Even 
though  the  correlation  index  observed  with  nodule  dry 
weight  decreased,  a  positive  correlation  was  still  observed 
(r=0.26).  Interestingly,  trehalose  correlation  index  increased 
to a significant value of 0.98. 

Effect of Co-Inoculation on Bean Biomass and Leaf Area 

Plant  leaf  area  with  the  different  inoculation  treatments 
 
under  both  water  regimes  is  shown  in  Table  2.  Under  well-
watered  conditions,  the  response  of  the  five  bean  genotypes 
to  the  different  inoculation  treatments  was  very  heterogene-
ous.  Nevertheless,  control  plants  that  where  chemically  fer-
tilized  showed  the  greatest  leaf  area  (149  cm2),  followed  by 
the  plants  co-inoculated  with  Rhizobium  and  Glomus  (138 

cm2).  Plants  inoculated  with  Rhizobium  had  an  average  leaf 
area  of  118  cm2,  and  the  minimum  recorded  value  corre-
sponded  to  plants  inoculated  with  Glomus  (103  cm2).  Also, 
considering  only  the  inoculated  treatments,  it  was  observed 
that  in  P.  filiformis  and  P.  acutifolius  plants,  co-inoculation 
resulted  in  a  negative  effect  by  reducing  the  leaf  area  when 
compared  to  the  maximum  area  obtained  under  inoculation, 
which  corresponded  to  Rhizobium  inoculation.  On  the  other 
hand,  co-inoculation  had  a  positive  effect  on  P.  vulgaris 
P1325687  and  P.  vulgaris  cv.  Flor  de  Mayo  genotypes, 
which  showed  the  greatest  leaf  area  under  this  treatment  in 
comparison to single inoculations.  

  Under  drought  stress,  bean  plants 
inoculated  with 
Glomus  presented  the  greatest  leaf  area  (96  cm2),  followed 
by  plants  inoculated  with  Rhizobium  (90  cm2).  Leaf  area  in 
fertilized control plants decreased to 85 cm2, and the smallest 
leaf  area  was  recorded  in  co-inoculated  plants  (84  cm2). 
Again,  considering  only  inoculation  treatments,  it  was  ob-
served  that  in  P.  acutifolius  and  P.  vulgaris  P1325687,  the 
maximum leaf area was obtained under Glomus  inoculation, 
and co-inoculation negatively affected this parameter. On the 
other  hand,  P.  acutifolius  and  P.  vulgaris  cv.  Flor  de  Mayo 
showed  greater  leaf  area  with  Rhizobium  inoculation,  being 
negatively  affected  by  co-inoculation.  P.  vulgaris  cv.  Pinto

Saltillo  represented  the  only  case  in  which  a  positive  effect 
of co-inoculation was observed, with maximum leaf area. 

  The  effect  of  inoculation  on  total  biomass  is  shown  in 
Table 3. In this case, the Rhizobium inoculation produced the 
highest biomass of all five genotypes tested, both under well-
watered  and  drought  stressed  plants.  The  total  biomass  for 
Rhizobium  inoculated  plants  under  well-watered  conditions 
was  2  mg  plant-1,  followed  by  plants  inoculated  with 
Glomus, with a biomass of 1.5 mg plant-1, and of the inocu-
lated plants, those  that were co-inoculated showed the  lower 
biomass  (1.4  mg  plant-1).  Plants  under  drought  stress  inocu-
lated  with  Rhizobium  showed  a  biomass  of  1.4  mg  plant-1; 
plants  inoculated  with  Glomus  showed  a  biomass  of  1  mg 
plant-1, and those co-inoculated showed 0.7 mg plant-1. 

  Considering  the  plant  biomass  obtained  under  well-
watered  conditions  as  100%  of  growth  for  the  different  in-
oculation  treatments,  inhibition  caused  by  drought  was  re-

corded and the results are shown in Fig. (5). Although there 
was  no  statistical  significance  (p<0.05)  among  inoculation 
treatments, the bean plants less affected by drought were the 
chemically  fertilized  ones  with  an  average  of  30%  biomass 
reduction when compared to their well-water counterpart. 

  Among  the  inoculated  treatments,  plants  inoculated  with 
Rhizobium were the least affected by drought (33% biomass 
reduction), followed by plants inoculated with Glomus (37% 
biomass reduction), and  the plants  most  sensitive to drought 
were the ones co-inoculated, with an average biomass reduc-
tion of 44%. 

DISCUSSION 

  The  biosynthesis  of  trehalose  has  been  correlated  with 
tolerance to different types of stress. Although this carbohy-
drate is widespread in nature, it is considered to be absent in 
superior  vascular  plants  in  the  past  decade.  Several  efforts

have  been  made  to  obtain  transgenic  plants  that  express  
the  microbial  genes  for  the  synthesis  of  trehalose,  with  the 
aim  of  increasing  plants’  tolerance  to  dehydration  [22,  23]. 
Up  until  today,  the  presence  of  trehalose  genes  in  several 
plants  has  been  reported  [24-26],  but  the  carbohydrate  has 
been  rarely  detected  [27],  and  assays  on  transgenic  plants 
continue  [28-31].  On  the  other  hand,  when  plants  are  in 
symbiosis  with  different  microorganisms,  trehalose  is  com-
monly  detected.  The  role  of  trehalose  in  these  interactions 
has been  mostly studied in the  Rhizobium-legume symbiosis 
and  less  work  has  been  conducted  in  regard  to  fungi-plant 
interaction. 

  Today, there are no reports in the literature that have con-
sidered  the  effect  of  co-inoculation  with  bacteria  and  fungi 
on plant trehalose accumulation. In this sense, studies on co-
inoculation  of  Rhizobium  and  mycorrhiza  on  legumes  have 
focused  on  mycorrhiza  performance  and  its  effect  on  plant 
nutrient  uptake  and,  only  in  a  few  cases,  on  plant  drought 
tolerance. For example, in faba bean (Vicia faba) it has been 
reported that mycorrhizal inoculation increased nodule num-
ber  when  compared  to  non-mycorrhized  plants,  and  this 
positive  effect  on  nodulation  was  also  observed  under 
drought  conditions,  but  when  plant  drought  tolerance  was 
discussed,  only  the  mycorrhizal  parameters  were  considered 
[32].  

  There  are  scarce  reports  on  common  bean,  and  these  re-
ports  point  to  a  negative  effect  of  mycorrhiza  on  nodule  de-
velopment and nitrogen fixation [20, 33]. Therefore, consid-
ering all the reports that establish that trehalose accumulation 
in  legume  nodules  is  related  to  increased  plant  drought 
stress,  the aim of the present work was to analyze the effect 
of  mycorrhizal  colonization  on  nodulated  common  bean 
based on parameters related to drought tolerance. 

  This  work  is  in  agreement  with  previous  reports  on 
common  bean,  which  support  the  idea  that  co-inoculation 
has  a  negative  effect  on  the  microsymbionts  that  are  in-
volved in this process [33], since nodulation and mycorrhizal 

colonization  were  higher  when  inoculated  independently, 
and  both  parameters  decreased  with  co-inoculation.  Of  the 
three wild beans used in this work, P. filiformis and P. acuti-
folius showed the lowest number of nodules in all treatments. 
This could be attributed to the origin of the rhizobial strains, 
which  were  isolated  from  a  field  devoted  to  common  bean 
production  and  may  not  be  the  most  adequate  strains  for 
these  two  genotypes.  On  the  contrary,  there  was  no  differ-
ence  in  mycorrhizal  colonization  between  these  three  geno-
types  under  well-watered  conditions.  P.  filiformis  showed 
high  mycorrhizal  colonization  under  drought  conditions. 
When  co-inoculation  was  assayed,  both  mycorrhizal  coloni-
zation and nodulation decreased in all bean genotypes tested. 
This  behavior  was  probably  due  to  a  competition  for  plant 
photosynthates  between  both  microorganisms,  imposed  by 
the  experimental  conditions  used  at  this  work.  Interestingly, 
when  the  data  from  the  five  bean  genotypes  were  combined 
to compute the correlation indexes, the opposite correlations 
were observed 

  Under  well-watered  conditions,  nodule  number  and  dry 
weight correlate positively with mycorrhizal colonization. In 
other words, among the different bean genotypes, the higher 
the  mycorrhization  the  higher  the  nodulation;  however,  as 
mentioned  earlier,  this  type  of  co-inoculation  reduced  the 
value  of  these  two  parameters  when  compared  to  plants  in-
oculated  only  with  Rhizobium.  In  drought  stressed  plants, 
correlation  indexes  between  nodulation  and  mycorrhizal 
colonization parameters were negative, indicating that nodu-
lation  is  more  sensitive  to  dehydration  than  the  mycorrhiza. 
Also,  as  mycorrhiza  is  more  widely  distributed  in  the  root, 
there  is  the  possibility  that  this  fungus  could  better  exploit 
the limited photosynthates available in this condition.  

 
In  regard  to  trehalose  accumulation,  in  co-inoculation 
treatments  there  was  a  decrease  in  its  nodule  content  when 
compared  with  plants  inoculated  only  with  rhizobia.  It  was 
observed  that  under  both  watering  regimes,  the  correlation 
index was positive, and under drought  it became highly sig-
nificant (r=0.98). Up until today, the precise biochemical and

molecular  control  of  trehalose  biosynthesis  in  the  nodule  is 
not understood. Although some data suggest that nodule  tre-
halose could be mobilized to the plant, there is no conclusive 
evidence.  Therefore,  if  there  is  a  trehalose  release  from  the 
nodule  under  drought  to  the  plant  tissue,  it  would  be  possi-
ble,  under  this  circumstance,  for  the  mycorrhiza  to  utilize  it 
and  export  the  trehalose  to  the  external  mycelia  and  spores, 
and this fungal dependency on nodule trehalose may provoke 
this  high  correlation  index.  The  mobilization  of  trehalose 
from  the  mycorrhizal  roots  to  the  external  mycelia  has  been 
previously observed in an experiment using as a study model 
transformed  carrot  roots,  which  once  mycorrhized,  were 
submitted to osmotic stress; it was observed that under these 
conditions, there was a higher trehalose content in the exter-
nal mycelia as compared to the non-stressed controls (Farias-
Rodriguez,  unpublished  data).  As  this  work  focused  on  re-
producing  the  soil  environment  under  field  conditions,  it’s 
very difficult to understand the basic mechanisms underlying 
this observation; in order to elucidate this relationship, future 
work  should  be  conducted  with  the  use  of  in  vitro  systems, 
that  will  allow  a  better  understanding  of  the  phenomena  re-
ported here. 

  When  considering  biomass  production  as  an  estimate  of 
drought  tolerance,  it  was  observed  once  again  that  plants 
inoculated  only  with  rhizobia  or  mycorrhiza  were  less  af-
fected  by  drought,  whereas  when  co-inoculated,  a  higher 
decrease in biomass production was observed as compared to 
the  plants’  well-watered  counterparts.  In  conclusion,  the  re-
sults  presented  in  this  work  support  the  idea  that  the  use  of 
rhizobial  or  mycorrhizal  inoculation  separately  would  result 
in  better  bean  drought  tolerance  than  the  co-inoculation 
treatment.
