Biogenic amines show biological activity and exert undesirable physiological effects when
absorbed at high concentrations. Biogenic amines are mainly formed by microbial decar-
boxylation of amino acids and thus are usually present in a wide range of foods, fermented
sausages being one of the major biogenic amine sources. The use of selected starter
cultures is one of the best technological measures to control aminogenesis during meat
fermentation. Although with variable effectiveness, several works show the ability of some
starters to render biogenic amine-free sausages. In this paper, the effect of different starter
culture is reviewed and the factors determining their performance discussed.

Keywords: starter cultures, biogenic amines, amino acid decarboxylase, fermented sausages, amino oxidase,

INTRODUCTION
Biologically active amines are nitrogenous low-molecular-weight
substances with biological functions in animals, plants, and
microorganisms. The biologically active amines known as biogenic
amines include tyramine, histamine, phenylethylamine, trypta-
mine, putrescine, and cadaverine. They are mainly derived from
the bacterial decarboxylation of precursor amino acids and can
be found in nearly all types of foods in a wide and variable
range of concentrations (Halász et al., 1994; Vidal-Carou et al.,
2007).

Histamine, tyramine, and to lesser extent phenylethylamine are
the main dietary biogenic amines associated with certain health
disruptions, mainly involving vasoactive and psychoactive reac-
tions: histaminic intoxication, food intolerance due to enteral
histaminosis, food-induced migraines, and interaction between
tyramine and MAOI drugs (Mariné-Font et al., 1995; Spano et al.,
2010; Linares et al., 2011). Additionally, high contents of bio-
genic amines in foods have traditionally been used as an index
of undesired microbial activity as a result of hygienically defective
manufacturing or storage practices (Mariné-Font et al., 1995; Suzzi
and Gardini, 2003; Ruiz-Capillas and Jiménez-Colmenero, 2004).
However, the manufacture of fermented foods involve the activ-
ity of a variety of microorganisms, not only associated with the
desired technological fermentative properties but also undesired
contaminants. Both types of microbial activities entail noticeable
risk of biogenic amine production. In this respect, the control
of biogenic amine accumulation in fermented products is one of
the present challenges of the food industry (Vidal-Carou et al.,
2007). In this review, the inﬂuence of starter cultures as a tech-
nological measure to control aminogenesis during meat fermen-
tation is reviewed and the factors determining their performance
discussed.

BIOGENIC AMINE CONTENTS IN FERMENTED SAUSAGES
Fermented meat sausages, together with other fermented foods
or beverages, constitute one of the food products that can accu-
mulate higher biogenic amine contents (Suzzi and Gardini, 2003;
Spano et al., 2010; EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ),
2011). Table 1 summarizes the occurrence of biogenic amines
in retail fermented meat products of different countries. Tyra-
mine is usually the most frequent and abundant biogenic amine
found in fermented sausages. In terms of average values, it has
been reported that fermented sausages show the highest tyramine
content among fermented products (EFSA Panel on Biological
Hazards (BIOHAZ), 2011). In fermented sausages, tyramine is
produced by fermentative microbial population, mainly lactic acid
bacteria (LAB, including lactobacilli and enterococci) and more
rarely coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS; Straub et al., 1994;
Masson et al., 1996; Montel et al., 1999; Bover-Cid et al., 2001a;
Aymerich et al., 2006; Martín et al., 2006; Latorre-Moratalla et al.,
2010a; Talon and Leroy, 2011). Latorre-Moratalla et al. (2010a)
reported that 48% of LAB and 13% of staphylococci isolated from
spontaneously fermented sausage are able to decarboxylate one or
more amino acids.

The occurrence of putrescine and cadaverine is also quite
common but more variable than tyramine. Although the con-
tents of diamines in fermented sausages are relatively low, in
a few cases their levels are extremely high, exceeding those of
tyramine. The production of diamines is usually attributed to
contaminant Gram-negative bacteria, such as enterobacteria and
pseudomonas (Bover-Cid et al., 2001a; Durlu-Özkaya et al., 2001;
Suzzi and Gardini, 2003). However, a number of publications show
several LAB and CNS strains with a powerful capability of produc-
ing putrescine and/or cadaverine (Straub et al., 1995; Bover-Cid
et al., 2001a; Martín et al., 2006; Latorre-Moratalla et al., 2010a).

Therefore, fermentative activities can also result in a considerable
diamine accumulation.

In contrast, histamine is usually more scarcely found in fer-
mented sausages. However, in some particular samples it may
reach quite high levels, usually accompanied by high amounts
of other biogenic amines. Histamine production seems to be
delimited to some strains of a reduced number of isolates of
enterobacteria or LAB, which are not commonly found unless spe-
ciﬁc contaminations occur (Maijala and Eerola, 1993; Roig-Sagués
et al., 1996; Silla-Santos, 1998; Bover-Cid et al., 2001a).

Phenylethylamine and tryptamine could be considered minor
amines occurring in fermented sausages. Their accumulation
seems dependent on the occurrence of high contents of tyramine
associated with some LAB or CNS (Vidal-Carou et al., 2007).

Levels of biogenic amines in fermented sausages show a great
variation among different types of products, manufacturers and
products from the same manufacturer. The inﬂuence of the micro-
biological quality of raw materials, which varies in each production
batch, is a key parameter to explain this variability. Addition-
ally, other factors such as ingredients and additives (sugar, curing
agents, spices, etc), diameter of sausage and technological ripening
conditions (temperature and relative humidity) can also inﬂuence
the phenomena associated with aminogenesis, including microbial
growth, acidiﬁcation, proteolysis, and activity of decarboxylases
(Maijala et al., 1995; Bover-Cid et al., 1999a, 2001b; Parente et al.,
2001; González-Fernández et al., 2003; Bozkurt and Erkmen, 2004;
Komprda et al., 2004; Latorre-Moratalla et al., 2012).

STARTER CULTURES FOR AMINOGENESIS CONTROL IN
FERMENTED SAUSAGE
TECHNOLOGICAL ROLE OF STARTER CULTURES IN RELATION TO
AMINOGENESIS
The hygienic quality of meat raw materials and ingredients is
crucial to minimize the occurrence of microbial contaminants,
and it thus constitutes a key point in controlling aminogene-
sis in fermented meat products (Maijala et al., 1995; Bover-Cid
et al., 2000a,b; Naila et al., 2010). However, hygiene is a necessary,
though not sufﬁcient condition and additional technological mea-
sures focused on the control of aminogenic activity of endogenous
microbiota are usually needed. Among the possible technological
strategies, the use of starter cultures is one of the most impor-
tant factors quantitatively affecting the accumulation of biogenic
amines during sausage fermentation (Bover-Cid et al., 2000c; Suzzi
and Gardini, 2003; Naila et al., 2010; EFSA Panel on Biological Haz-
ards (BIOHAZ), 2011; Talon and Leroy, 2011). Indeed, the mech-
anism of starter cultures is based on preventing the outgrowth of
the potential aminogenic endogenous bacteria together with their
own inability to produce biogenic amines (Lonvaud-Funel, 2001;
Suzzi and Gardini, 2003).

Strains of LAB and CNS speciﬁcally selected as starter cul-
tures have to comply with some technological criteria, among
which the adaptation to meat fermentation, the ability to com-
pete with the natural (endogenous) microbiota of raw materials
and the lack of amino acid decarboxylase capability are the most
relevant for the control of biogenic amine production (Buck-
enhüskes, 1993; EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ),
2011; Talon and Leroy, 2011). Some LAB and CNS species usually

Starters for aminogenesis control in fermented sausages

used as meat starters (i.e., L. curvatus and S. carnosus) have been
reported as strong biogenic amine producers, mainly of tyramine
(Latorre-Moratalla et al., 2010a; Talon and Leroy, 2011). In con-
trast, species such as L. sakei, L. plantarum, and S. xylosus are
usually described as weak or non-aminogenic microorganisms
(Bover-Cid et al., 2001a; Aymerich et al., 2006; Latorre-Moratalla
et al., 2010a; Linares et al., 2011). However, though some genera
or species are more frequently reported than others to be able
to produce speciﬁc biogenic amines, the ability to decarboxy-
late amino acids is a strain-dependent property (Bover-Cid and
Holzapfel, 1999; Lonvaud-Funel, 2001; Linares et al., 2011). There-
fore, it is necessary to carry out a case-by-case evaluation of the
aminogenic activity of the strains to be selected as amine nega-
tive starter culture. For this purpose, several procedures have been
reported (Marcobal et al., 2006; Landete et al., 2007; EFSA Panel
on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ), 2011). Amino acid decarboxy-
lase potential might be tested by molecular techniques detecting
speciﬁc genes coding for amino-acid decarboxylase. Nevertheless,
the aminogenic potential of a given strain should be conﬁrmed
through the study of the phenotypic expression of this activity,
both in vitro (as a screening procedure) and ﬁnally in real fermen-
tation and ripening conditions (EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards
(BIOHAZ), 2011).

EFFECTIVENESS OF AMINE-NEGATIVE DECARBOXYLASE STARTER
CULTURES IN BIOGENIC AMINE REDUCTION
Several studies have evaluated the use of commercial and exper-
imental starter cultures in order to reduce aminogenesis during
the fermentation of sausages. Although a number of studies have
demonstrated the beneﬁcial effect of starter cultures in reducing
biogenic amine accumulation (Maijala et al., 1995; Hernández-
Jover et al., 1997b; Bover-Cid et al., 1999b; González-Fernández
et al., 2003; Gençcelep et al., 2007; Gücükoglu and Küplülü, 2010;
Lu et al., 2010; Baka et al., 2011), other studies failed to demonstrate
the efﬁciency of starter cultures to reduce the presence of biogenic
amines in some fermented meat products (Rice and Koehler, 1976;
Buncic et al., 1993; Bauer et al., 1994; Paulsen and Bauer, 1997;
Roig-Sagués et al., 1997; Parente et al., 2001; Bozkurt and Erkmen,
2002).

Table 2 summarizes the relative reduction of biogenic amines
by the use of negative amine producer starter cultures obtained
from different experiments. In these studies, different percentages
of biogenic amine reduction are observed depending on the bac-
terial species inoculated, varying from 9% to practically 100%.
Moreover, some starters showed an ability to reduce the produc-
tion of all amines and in other cases only reduce certain amines
(Ayhan et al., 1999; Bover-Cid et al., 1999b; Gençcelep et al., 2007;
Coloretti et al., 2008; Baka et al., 2011; Casquete et al., 2011).

In general, starters containing LAB species showed a higher
effectiveness in biogenic amine reduction than starters includ-
ing only CNS (Bover-Cid et al., 1999b, 2001b). LAB starter cul-
tures could exert a more efﬁcient replacement of endogenous
microbiota with potential aminogenic ability, usually consist-
ing of lactobacilli and enterococci. In particular within starters
including LAB species, those containing L. sakei or L. plantarum
are reported to signiﬁcantly inhibit amine accumulation, though
with different intensity depending on the strain and product

(Hernández-Jover et al., 1997b; Coloretti et al., 2008; Latorre-
Moratalla et al., 2010b; Baka et al., 2011; Tosukhowong et al., 2011).
Within CNS, although their proteolytic activity could stimulate
the aminogenesis by means of providing the amino acid precur-
sors, Bover-Cid et al. (1999b) showed the potential of proteolytic
staphylococci to inhibit biogenic amine production.

Several studies support a greater efﬁciency in biogenic amine
reduction when L. sakei was used as the starter in comparison with
other species (González-Fernández et al., 2003; Gençcelep et al.,
2007; Latorre-Moratalla et al., 2010b; Baka et al., 2011). L. sakei are
usually well adapted to the ecology of meat fermentation and are
competitive between the temperatures of 15 and 25˚C, which is the
temperature range for sausages manufacture in European Coun-
tries (Hugas and Monfort, 1997; Bover-Cid et al., 2001b). In the
study carried out by González-Fernández et al. (2003), among all
the decarboxylase negative strains tested, L. sakei K29 showed the
most efﬁciency in reducing amine production probably because
this strain caused a rapid pH drop during sausage fermentation.
Bover-Cid et al. (2001b) also described that the amino acid decar-
boxylase negative strain L. sakei CTC494 showed a strong ability to
reduce biogenic amine formation in Spanish fermented sausage.
However, when this same strain (L. sakei CTC494) was com-
bined with S. carnosus LHT 2102, S. xylosus CTC3037 or S. xylosus
CTC3050 an even more effective reduction of amine accumulation
was achieved compared with the effect of each strain used alone
(Bover-Cid et al., 1999b, 2000c). Similarly, Latorre-Moratalla et al.
(2010b) described that the rate of reduction was improved when a
mixed starter was used. Thus, after the addition of a single strain of
S. equorum, the contents of cadaverine were reduced by 45% and
the single strain of L. sakei inoculated in the same product was far
more effective, reducing cadaverine by 75%. However, both strains
(L. sakei and S. equorum) used together as a mixed starter reduced
cadaverine by 89%. In fact, mixed starters may perform better than
single starters being able to control the growth of different bacter-
ial groups (Bover-Cid et al., 2000c; Latorre-Moratalla et al., 2010b;
Naila et al., 2010).

Commercial starters usually used in industrial manufacture
may not be fully adapted to the meat fermentation environment
or more speciﬁcally to traditional fermenting conditions. Nowa-
days, for the fermentation of artisanal sausages the addition of
the so-called autochthonous starter cultures consisting of selected
strains originating from each speciﬁc fermented meat product is
recommended (Benito et al., 2007; Talon et al., 2007; Casquete
et al., 2011). Thus, an autochthonous starter helps to maintain the
typical unique characteristics of artisanal products (Talon et al.,
2007). This better adaptation and competitiveness of autochtho-
nous starters compared with commercial ones could explain the
greater reduction of biogenic amine contents in artisanal meat
fermented products.

In this line, commercial mixed starters combining different
LAB and staphylococci species (Hernández-Jover et al., 1997b;
Ayhan et al., 1999; Gücükoglu and Küplülü, 2010) showed poorer
amine reductions than those provided by mixed autochthonous
starter cultures (Talon et al., 2008; Latorre-Moratalla et al., 2010b;
Casquete et al., 2011). Talon et al. (2008) and Latorre-Moratalla
et al. (2010b) evaluated the effect of autochthonous starter cul-
tures without amino decarboxylase activity on biogenic amine

reduction in different artisanal European fermented sausages. The
work demonstrated the importance of case-by-case basis strain
selection to obtain a good adaptation to the meat fermentation
environment and in turn a good biogenic amine prevention.

It has been suggested that the use of bacterial strains with
amine oxidase activity might enhance the reduction of biogenic
amine accumulation by metabolizing the amines formed during
the fermentation. Amine oxidase activity, metabolizing tyramine
and/or histamine under in vitro conditions, has been described in
microorganisms involved in sausage fermentation, such as speciﬁc
strains of LAB (L. sakei or L. plantarum) and CNS (S. xylosus;
Leuschner and Hammes, 1998; Martuscelli et al., 2000; Fadda
et al., 2001; Gardini et al., 2002). However, under real condi-
tions of sausage fermentation, amine-oxidizing microorganisms
have shown a limited effect on tyramine and histamine levels,
likely due to a low oxygen availability inside the sausage and/or an
insufﬁcient number of amine-oxidizing bacteria, e.g., below the
minimum 107 cfu/g, required for amine degradation (Leuschner
and Hammes, 1998; Gardini et al., 2002).

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE PERFORMANCE OF STARTER
CULTURES IN REDUCING BIOGENIC AMINE ACCUMULATION
The magnitude of reduction of biogenic amine accumulation
achieved by a starter culture depends on the factors that deter-
mine the presence of endogenous microbiota as well as the
competitiveness and implantation of the added starter culture.

It is clearly demonstrated that poor hygienic quality of raw
materials and ingredients diminished the protective effect of the
amine negative starter culture. Bover-Cid et al. (2001b) reported

reduction in the effectiveness of the amino acid
a signiﬁcant
decarboxylase negative strain L. sakei CTC494 when sausages were
made from raw materials of relatively poor hygienic quality, since
high bacterial loads (both of Gram-negative and Gram-positive)
increase the number of potentially aminogenic microorganisms
and also hamper the implantation and competitiveness of amine
negative technological microbiota.

Different processing environment (e.g., pilot plant versus tra-
ditional processing plant) and the different type of formulation
(e.g., chorizo or fuet ) can also signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the perfor-
mance of the amine negative starter culture. The addition of a
mixed starter culture including L. sakei (CTC6469+ CTC6626)
and S. xylosus (CTC6013+ CTC6169) with no amino acid decar-
boxylase activity was successfully used in a fermentation study
carried out in pilot plants by Garriga et al. (2005). The starter
prevented the accumulation of tyramine, putrescine, and cadav-
erine by up to 90% of total amines. However, when the same
strains (L. sakei CTC6626+ S. xylosus CTC6013) were inoculated
into products produced in a traditional real processing plant, the
starter culture showed a weaker effect, only slightly reducing the
contents of tyramine and cadaverine, by 19 and 46%, respectively
(Latorre-Moratalla et al., 2010b).

In the literature, several studies have evaluated the effect of
factors that inﬂuence starter culture on biogenic amine reduction,
such as the type and quantity of sugar added (González-Fernández
et al., 2003) or the addition of some additives (Bozkurt and Erk-
men, 2007; Coloretti et al., 2008). According to the results reported
by González-Fernández et al. (2003), when the starter culture,
especially L. sakei K29, was used with a sugar concentration of

0.5 or 1%, the presence of biogenic amines decreased consider-
ably in comparison with the control and low sugar concentration
sausage. Bozkurt and Erkmen (2007) described a higher decrease
of tyramine, histamine and putrescine contents when a mixture
of antimicrobials (nitrite and nitrate), antioxidants, and ﬂavor-
ing and coloring compounds were added with the starter culture
mixture of Pediococcus acidilactici, L. plantarum, and S. carnosus.
The inﬂuence of processing temperatures on the reducing
effect of starter cultures has been fully studied (Maijala et al.,
1995; Komprda et al., 2001; Gücükoglu and Küplülü, 2010; Cas-
quete et al., 2011). Gücükoglu and Küplülü (2010) reported that
higher ripening temperatures (26˚C versus 22˚C) potentiated the
reduction of putrescine by different starter cultures (L. sakei + S.
xylosus B-FM, L. plantarum + S. carnosus TD66, and L. curva-
tus + S. carnosus + S. xylosus RM-10) in experimental Turkish
fermented sausages. However, the fermentation temperatures did
not have any signiﬁcant effect on tyramine reduction. Similarly,
Casquete et al. (2011) described an inﬂuence of temperatures on

the development and activity of autochthonous starter cultures
consisting of P. acidilactici MS200+ S. vitulus RS34 and P. acidi-
lactici MS198+ S. vitulus RS34. In this case, higher fermentation
temperature (12˚C versus 7˚C) also obtained the highest reduction
of amines, probably due to a better adaptation of the starters to
the meat fermentation environment.

In conclusion, the absence of decarboxylase activity should be a
criterion for the selection of strains intended for use as starter cul-
tures to obtain fermented sausages free of biogenic amines. Mixed
starter cultures consisting of amine negative strains of LAB and
CNS species, well adapted to the meat fermentation environment,
seem the best alternative. Moreover, the use of autochthonous
strains is presented as a promising control measure especially for
the manufacture of traditional fermented sausages. High qual-
ity raw materials and optimal technological conditions are cru-
cial factors to ensure a proper performance of starter cultures
for the reduction of biogenic amine accumulation in fermented
sausages.
