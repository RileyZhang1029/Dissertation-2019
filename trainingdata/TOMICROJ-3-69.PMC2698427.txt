Abstract:  Leptospirosis  is  a  worldwide  zoonotic  infection  of  human  and  veterinary  concern.  Caused  by  pathogenic  
spirochetes  of  the  genus  Leptospira,  the  disease  presents  greater  incidence  in  tropical  and  subtropical  regions.  The  
identification  of  proteins  that  could  be  involved  in  the  bacteria  host  interactions  may  facilitate  the  search  for  immune  
protective  antigens.  We  report  the  proteomic  analysis  of  Leptospira  interrogans  serovar  Pomona  virulent  strain  LPF  
cultured from kidney and liver of infected hamsters. Total protein extracts were separated by two-dimensional gel electro-
phoresis (2-DE), 895 spots were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS), and 286 were identified as leptospi-
ral proteins, corresponding to 108 distinct proteins. These proteins are allocated in all the bacterial cell compartments and 
are  distributed  in  every  functional  category.  Furthermore,  the  previously  described,  known  outer  membrane  proteins, 
OmpL1,  LipL21,  LipL31,  LipL32/Hap-1,  LipL41,  LipL45,  LipL46,  LruA/LipL71,  and  OmpA-like  protein  Loa22  were  
all  recognized.  Most  importantly,  this  research  work  identified  27  novel  leptospiral  proteins  annotated  as  hypothetical 
open  reading  frames  (ORFs).  We  report  for  the  first  time  an  array  of  proteins  of  the  Leptospira  expressed  by  virulent,  
low-passage  strain.  We  believe  that  our  studies,  together  with  the  genome  data  will  enlighten  our  understanding  of  the 
disease.

INTRODUCTION 

  The  spirochete  Leptospira 
interrogans  is  a  highly  
invasive  pathogen  and  the  causal  agent  of  leptospirosis,  one 
of  the  most  widespread  zoonosis  of  human  and  veterinary 
concern  [1-5].  The  leptospires  chronically  infect  domestic 
and  wild  mammalian  species  that  harbor  the  bacteria  in  
their renal tubules, shedding them through the urine into the 
environment,  contaminating  soil,  water,  and  re-infecting 
other  animals.  Humans  are  accidental  hosts  in  the  transmis-
sion process of leptospirosis [5, 6]. The leptospires enter the 
body  via  abrasions  on  the  skin,  or  enter  actively  through  
mucosa,  spreading  to  any  tissue,  but  specifically  colonizing 
the  kidneys  and  liver.  Fever,  headache,  anorexia,  muscle 
pain,  and  constipation  are  the  general  symptoms  of  the  
disease.  About  5-15%  of  the  cases  evolve  more  severely, 
presenting  hemorrhages  with  renal  and  hepatic  failure  -  a 
condition  known  as  Weil’s  syndrome,  with  a  mortality  rate 
of  5-40%  [4,  5].  Leptospirosis  also  has  a  great  economic 
impact,  since  the  disease  affects  the  livestock  inducing  
abortions,  stillbirths,  infertility,  reduced  milk  production,  
and  death  [5].  Despite  its  importance,  the  aspects  of

pathogenesis, virulence, and invasion processes by which the 
leptospires infect the hosts and initiate tissue colonization are 
poorly characterized. 

  The genomic sequences of five strains of Leptospira, four 
pathogenic  [7-9]  and  one  non-pathogenic  [10],  are  now 
available.  The  genomic  comparison  and  analysis  in  the 
pathogenic species revealed many hypothetical open reading 
frames  (ORFs)  and  proteins  with  unknown  functions  that 
might  be  involved  in  the  pathogenesis  and  virulence  of  
the  leptospires.  Although  the  genomic  tools  are  important  
to  reveal  the  general  aspects  of  the  organism,  it  does  not 
characterize which proteins are being expressed under a certain 
condition.  For  instance,  it  has  already  been  demonstrated  
that  some  leptospiral  virulence  factors  are  down-regulated 
after  several  passages  in  the  culture  medium  [11-13].  
Accordingly, proteomics is being used in an attempt to solve 
some  of  these  questions;  however,  so  far,  only  a  few  
Leptospira  proteomic  or  immunoproteomic  studies  have 
been  published  [14-18].  Furthermore,  these  works  have  
focused  on  the  identification  of  Triton  X-114-derived  
membrane  proteins  [16,  19],  affinity  capture  of  biotinylated 
membrane proteins [14], outer membrane vesicles [15], or in 
the case of immunoproteomics, the identification of proteins 
that  are  reactive  with  immune  mouse  serum  [17]  or  serum 
from chronically infected rats [20]. 

 
In this study, we report the analysis of the protein expres-

cultured,  low-passage,  from  kidney  and  liver  of  infected 
hamsters.  The  choice  of  the  serovar  was  due  to  the  well  
established  virulence  of  this  strain  in  our  laboratory.  We 
identified  by  2-DE/mass  spectrometry  (MS)  286  leptospiral 
proteins,  corresponding 
to  108  distinct  proteins.  We  
confirmed  the  expression  of  27  novel  proteins  that  are  
genome  annotated  as  hypothetical.  Additionally,  we  identi-
fied  some  uncharacterized  predicted  outer  membrane  
proteins,  which  are  a  class  of  proteins  that  have  been  the 
focus of the leptospirosis research worldwide. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Bacteria 

  The  virulence  of  the  L.  interrogans  serovar  Pomona 
strain  LPF  was  maintained  by  iterative  passages  in  Golden 
Syrian  hamsters.  Recently  weaned  hamsters  were  intraperi-
tonially  infected  with  500  (cid:1)L  of  approximately  1  (cid:2)  104  
virulent  leptospires.  The  animals  were  sacrificed  after  the 
appearance of symptoms, such as loss of weight and mobility 
(approximately 5 days post-infection). Kidney and liver were 
removed  and  macerated.  The  leptospires  recovered  from 
these  organs  were  cultured  at  28oC  in  semi-solid  EMJH-
modified  medium  supplemented  with  10%  rabbit  sera,  
followed  by  sub-culture  in  liquid  EMJH  (Difco(cid:1)-  USA)  
supplemented  with  10%  rabbit  sera,  until  the  density  of  
approximately 108 cells/mL was reached.

were  covered  with  mineral  oil  to  prevent  dehydration  and 
oxidation, and the process was carried out overnight at room 
temperature  in  the  Immobiline  Dry-Strip  Reswelling  Tray 
(GE  Healthcare).  The  focusing  protocol  was  30  V  for  180 
Vh, 150 V for 300 Vh, 350 V for 350 Vh, 500 V for 500 Vh, 
1000  V  for  1000  Vh,  3000  V  for  3000  Vh,  and  5000  V  for 
65000 Vh, with a 50 (cid:1)A/strip maximum-setting at 20oC. The 
strips were equilibrated twice (reduced and alkylated) for 15 
min  in  15  mL  equilibration  solution  (0.05  M  Tris-HCl,  pH 
8.8,  6.0  M  urea,  30%  [v/v]  glycerol,  and  2%  [w/v]  SDS), 
first  with  the  addition  of  1%  DTT,  and  finally  with  2.5% 
iodoacetamide.  After  equilibration, 
the  
molecular-mass  marker  proteins  were  attached  to  the  12% 
SDS-PAGE,  1  mm  thickness,  using  1%  agarose.  The  
electrophoretic  conditions  were  as  follows:  5  W/gel  for  30 
min and 17 W/gel until the end of the running. The gels were 
stained  for  24-48  h  using  Coomassie  Blue  R350  (PhastGel 
Blue  R  -  GE  Healthcare)  under  gentle  agitation,  and  then 
were rinsed with ultrapure water (MilliQ grade). The destain-
ing of the spots was  carried out  in the  solution of 40% (v/v) 
ethanol and 10% (v/v) acetic acid. The gels were digitalized 
in  transparency  mode,  and  analyzed  with  Image  Master-2D 
Platinum  version  6.0  software  (GE  Healthcare,  USA).  The  
2-DE  gels  were  performed  in  triplicates  for  the  protein  
extracts  of  leptospires  cultured  from  kidney  and  liver  of  
infected hamsters.

Mass Spectrometry 

  The culture was harvested by centrifugation at 12800(cid:2) g 
at 4oC for 10 min. Pellet was washed ((cid:2)5) by resuspension in 
35  mL  phosphate-buffered  saline  (PBS)  containing  5  mM 
MgCl2,  followed  by  centrifugation  under  similar  conditions 
described earlier. The pellet was weighed and resuspended in 
DeStreak Rehydration Solution (GE Healthcare, USA) at the 
proportion  of  5  (cid:1)L/mg  of  the  bacteria.  The  cells  were  lysed 
by  vigorous  vortexing  followed  by  mechanical  pressure 
through  a  syringe.  The  cellular  debris  was  separated  by  
centrifugation  at  20800(cid:2)  g  for  10  min  at  room  temperature 
and  the  supernatant  was  collected.  Total  protein  content  
was  determined  according  to  the  Bradford  method  (Pierce  
Biotechnology, USA), following the manufacture’s protocol. 
Bovine  serum  albumin  (BSA)  was  used  to  generate  a  
standard  reference  curve  (0-10  (cid:1)g).  The  protein  solution  
was  mixed  at  the  appropriate  proportions  with  the  Bradford 
reagent  dye,  and  after  30  min  of  incubation  at  room  
temperature, the readings were taken at 595 nm. The protein 
concentration  from  each  sample  was  calculated  based  
on  BSA  standard  absorbance  curve.  Samples  of  700  (cid:1)g  of 
protein were adjusted to 340 (cid:1)L with DeStreak Rehydration 
Solution  (GE  Healthcare,  USA),  along  with  0.8%  (v/v)  IPG 
buffer, with a pH range of 3-10 (GE Healthcare). The protein 
extracts  were  obtained  in  triplicate  from  bacteria  cultured 
from kidney and liver of infected animals.  

Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (2-DE Gels) 

First-dimension isoelectric focusing was performed using 
 
the  IPGphor-System  (GE  Healthcare,  USA),  and  the  second 
dimension  was  conducted  on  the  Ettan  DALTsix  system  
(GE  Healthcare).  The  IPG  gel  strips  (18  cm)  with  a  linear 
separation  of  immobilized  pH  ranging  from  3  to  10  were 
rehydrated  directly  with  the  solubilized  samples.  The  strips 

  The  samples  were  analyzed  by  MALDI-TOF  (Matrix 
Assisted  Laser  Desorption  Ionization-Time  of  Flight)  MS, 
using  (cid:3)-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic  acid  as  the  matrix  on  an 
Ettan  MALDI-TOF/Pro  instrument (Amersham  Biosciences, 
USA).  Briefly,  the  gel  spots  were  isolated  and  dehydrated 
with  acetonitrile  (ACN).  Then,  the  treated  spots  were  
rehydrated with 40 ng/μL trypsin solution in 50 mM ammo-
nium  acetate,  and  the  reaction  was  carried  out  overnight  at 
37°C. The tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel spots 
using  an  H2O/ACN/TFA  (1:1:0.05)  solution  and  this  proce-
dure  was  repeated  3X.  The  peptide  solutions  were  concen-
trated  and  desalted  with  ZipTip  C-18  pipette  microcolumns 
(Millipore)  prior  to  analysis.  The  samples  were  pre-mixed 
with  the  matrix  solution  (1:1  [v/v])  and  approximately  0.5 
μL  was  dropped  on  the  sample  loader  and  let  to  dry  over  
the  bench.  The  MS  was  performed  on  the  reflectron  mode 
and  internal  calibration  (trypsin  autolysis  peptide).  External 
calibration  was  also  carried  out  in  case  the  trypsin  peptides 
were not present or clear. 

Database Searches 

  The  MALDI-TOF  obtained  mass  lists  were  analyzed  
by  peptide  mass  fingerprinting  (PMF)  algorithms  on  the 
server  MASCOT  (http://www.matrixscience.com/cgi/ 
search_form.pl?FORMVER=2&SEARCH=PMF)  for  matches 
with  known  protein  sequences  deposited  on  the  public  or 
proprietary  databases.  The  searches  were  performed  against 
MSDB  non  redundant  and  L.  interrogans  serovar  Copenha-
geni  databases  without  any  MW  or  pI  restrictions.  One 
missed  cleavage  site  per  peptide  was  allowed,  and  an  error 
tolerance of ±0.2 Da on the mass measurement was used for 
the  search  and modifications such  as, carbamidomethylation 
of  cysteines  and  random  oxidation  of  methionines  were

taken into account. The positively identified protein matches 
were considered to be those that were statistically significant 
by  the  probability-based  MOUSE  scoring  of  the  server 
MASCOT  (score>42),  which  takes  into  account  a  value  of 
p<0.05 for the random matches.

Additional Bioinformatic Analyses 

RESULTS  

  The  indentified  L.  interrogans  proteins  were  further  
analyzed  by  the  bioinformatics  tools.  The  web-based  tool  
P-CLASSIFIER [21] that considers five primary localization 
sites  of  Gram-negative  bacteria  (cytoplasm,  extracellular 
space, inner membrane, outer membrane, and periplasm) was 
used  to  predict  the  subcellular  localization  of  the  identified 
proteins  (http://protein.bii.a-star.edu.sg/localization/gram-
negative/),  taking  into  account  the  greatest  probability.  The 
LipoP  server  [22]  (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LipoP/) 
was  used  to  predict  the  lipoproteins  and  discriminate  
between  lipoprotein  signal  peptides  (SpII),  other  signal  
peptides (SpI), and n-terminal membrane helices (TMH) that 
might  be  present  in  the  proteins.  This  program  is  specific  
for  Gram-negative  bacteria  and  is  based  on  the  lipobox  
consensus  sequence.  For 
the  purpose  of  analysis  of  
functional  category  of  the  identified  proteins,  the  genomic 
database  of L.  interrogans serovar  Copenhageni  (http://aeg. 
lbi.ic.unicamp.br/world/lic/),  (http://cmr.jcvi.org/cgi-bin/ 
CMR/GenomePage.cgi?org=ntli03)  and  the  Entrez  Gene  
of  National  Center  for  Biotechnology  Information  (NCBI) 

Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (2-DE Gels) 

 
Protein  extracts  were  fractioned  by  2-DE  gels,  focalized 
in  the  pH  range  of  3-10  and  molecular  mass  separated  in 
12%  acrylamide  gels.  Representative  Coomassie  Blue  R 
stained gels, from three independent experiments, of protein 
extracts  of  Leptospira  cultured  from  kidney  and  liver  are 
shown  in  Fig.  (1),  where  some  identified  proteins  are  illus-
trated. The protein spots were observed to be mainly distrib-
uted between de pIs 5-7 and were almost absent in the basic 
or  acid  extreme  regions  of  the  strips  (Fig.  1).  Our  data  are  
in  agreement  with  the  published  studies  that  have  shown 
leptospiral-protein  focalization  between  pIs  4  and  7  [19], 
including proteins of whole Leptospira [2].  

Mass Spectrometry 

  All  the  isolated  and  visible  major  protein  spots  were  
excised from each gel and were separately processed for MS. 
After  MALDI-TOF  MS,  the  obtained  PMF  mass  lists  were 
searched  and  compared  against  the  L.  interrogans  serovar

spots  were  analyzed,  resulting  in  positive  identification  of 
286  spots  (31.9  %)  as  leptospiral  proteins.  The  108  recog-
nized  proteins  are  representative  of  all  functional  categories 
used  in  genome  annotation,  and  their  respective  percentages 
are  depicted  in  Fig.  (2).  The  proteins  were  assigned  in:  (a)

showed  that  the  allocation  of  the  proteins  is  similar  to  all 
categories,  with  the  highest  number  of  proteins  being  
presented  in  the  hypothetical  category  (Fig.  2).  This  data  is 
very  important,  because  it  validates  the  expression  of  these 
leptospiral  proteins  with  unknown  function.  A  complete  list 
with general  analysis of identified proteins of L. interrogans 
serovar  Pomona  cultured  from  kidney  and  liver  of  infected 
animals  is  presented  in  Table  1  (supporting  information). 
Sequences of matched peptides of each identified protein are 
shown in Table 2, supporting information.  

Bioinformatics Analysis 

  The  identification  of  the  surface  proteins  is  an  important 
theme  of  the  current  leptospiral  research.  Owing  to  their  
location,  the  leptospiral  surface  proteins  are  expected  to  
be  relevant  in  the  host-cells  interactions  in  the  context  of 
pathogenesis  and  their  potential  ability  to  promote  heterolo-
gous  immunity.  Predicted  membrane  proteins,  according  
to P-CLASSIFIER program, with or without signal peptidase 
I  or  II  cleavage  sites,  as  predicted  by  LipoP  program,  are 
compiled  in  Table  1  (supporting  information).  The  analysis 
of the subcellular localization of the proteins, as predicted by 
P-CLASSIFIER [21] revealed that the identified proteins are 
allocated  in  all  the  bacterial  cell  compartments:  cytoplasm 
(78),  periplasm  (8),  inner  membrane  (4),  outer  membrane 
(14), and extracellular (3) (Table 1, supporting information). 

  The  108  identified  proteins  in  L.  interrogans  serovar 
Pomona  were  also  observed  in  L.  interrogans  serovars  
Lai  and  Copenhageni  genomes  [7,  8,  23],  99  of  them  were 
conserved  in  both  the  strains  of  L.  borgpetersenii  serovar 
Hardjo  and  80  were  present  in  L.  biflexa  serovar  Patoc  
sequenced  strains  [9,  10].  Protein  conservation  among  these 
later  strains  is  depicted  in  Table  3  (supporting  information) 
that  shows  (in  gray)  that  8  of  the  hypothetical  proteins  
validated  in  this  work  are  absent  in  the  saprophytic  non-
pathogenic L. biflexa.

DISCUSSION 
It is well known that leptospires lose their ability to infect 
 
after a long period of cultivation. This may be owing to the 
differential  expression  of  essential  virulence  factors  that 
could  be  suppressed  according  to  the  environmental  condi-
tions [5].  Recently, proteins  that  are down-regulated during 
the  culture-attenuation  process  and  up-regulated  in  condi-
tions  that  approximate  the  host  environment  have  been  
identified  [12,  13].  Our  work  aimed  to  evaluate  the  global 
picture  of  proteome  expression  of  virulent,  low  passage  L. 
interrogans  serovar  Pomona  sub-cultured  from  the  kidney 
and  liver  of  infected  animals.  Under  these  conditions  
we  succeeded  to  have  high  cellular  density  and  therefore 
sufficient  amount  of  proteins  to  perform  the  proteomic 
analysis.  In  addition,  it  is  well  documented  that  one  sub-
culture preserves the virulence of Leptospira [5, 12, 13, 24].  
  A  total  895  spots  were  analyzed,  resulting  in  positive 
identification  of  286  spots  (31.9  %)  as  leptospiral  proteins. 
The 286 spots identified by mass spectrometry corresponded 
to  108  different  leptospiral  proteins,  some  of  them  being 
present  in  multiple  spots  with  pI  and/  or  molecular-mass 
variations. The multiplicity of the spots might be due to protein 
isoforms  resulting  from  post-translational  modifications  or 
protein  degradation  during  the  2-DE  procedure,  and  have 
also  been  observed  in  other  proteomic  studies  [14,  16,  19, 
25]. The total number of proteins detected in this study by 2-
DE  gels  coupled  with  MALDI-TOF  MS  is  not  high  when 
compared with the total proteins predicted in the pathogenic 
strains by genome sequencing [7-9, 23]. This is probably due 
to  the  limitation  of  2-DE  such  as,  protein  solubilization  in 
aqueous  media,  the  pH  range  for  isoelectric  focusing,  the 
amount of protein expressed and the dynamic range of 2-DE 
electrophoretic  separation  allied  to  the  limitation  of  MS 
method that does not always identify the proteins regardless 
of the noticeable amounts exhibited by protein staining. This 
is possibly a consequence of site-specific trypsin used in spot 
gel-derived for proteinase digestion [15]. Additional identifi-
cation of leptospiral proteins may be improved by the use of 
other pH gradients for isoelectric focusing and by alternative 
proteinase  cleavage  conditions  by  the  use  of  MS/MS  
compatible instruments. 
  The  previously  described  leptospiral  membrane  proteins 
identified  using  Triton  X-114-extract  OMPs  [19],  biotiny-
lated-surface  proteins  [14],  outer  membrane  vesicles  [15], 
and  in  outer  membrane  proteome  of  L.  interrogans  serovar 
Copenhageni  [16]  were  recognized  in  this  study:  OmpL1 
(LIC10973)  [26],  LipL31  (LIC11456)  [2],  LipL32/Hap-1 
(LIC11352)  [27,  28],  LipL41  (LIC12966)  [29],  LipL45 
(LIC11643)  [30],  LipL21  (LIC10011)  [31],  LruA/LipL71 
(LIC11003)  [32],  OmpA-like  protein  Loa22  (LIC10191) 
[33].  In  addition  to  these  proteins,  our  work  also  identified 
LipL46, a recently characterized lipoprotein (LIC11885) [34] 
and,  most  importantly,  5  novel  hypothetical  SpI-  and  SpII-
containing  proteins  (Table  1).  However,  the  leptospiral  im-
munoglobulin-like  A  (LigA)  protein,  detected  in  TX-114-
extracted proteins [16] was not observed in our study. Addi-
tionally,  the  24-kDa  LfhA/  Lsa24/LenA  [35-37]  and  Lsa21 
proteins  [13]  were  not  identified.  Separation  of  proteins  by 
2-DE  is  limited  for  large  and  highly  hydrophobic  proteins 
that are difficult to solubilize, and that might be the case of 

the  high  molecular-mass  LigA  protein  [11].  In  spite  of  
intense  studies,  majority  of  leptospiral  membrane  proteins 
and lipoproteins identified in the genome sequences [7-9, 23] 
were still assigned as hypothetical proteins of unknown func-
tion. The proteome expression of these proteins identified in 
virulent,  low-passage  Leptospira  validates  their  existence 
within  the  bacteria,  and  allows  some  speculation  of  their 
possible role  in the process of leptospiral pathogenesis. We 
have  identified  34  hypothetical-annotated  proteins,  being  7 
of them previously validated by Nally et al. [15] and Sakol-
varee  et  al. [17] (see  Table  1, supporting information). The 
27 novel proteins comprise 2 SpI-containing proteins, 3 pre-
dicted SpII lipoproteins and 2 proteins containing TMH do-
mains,  as  predicted  by  the  Lipo-P  program  [22].  Addition-
ally,  we  have  identified  7  proteins  related  to  the  flagella 
structure  and 
the  previously  characterized  chaperones 
GroES/Hsp10,  DnaK  (Hsp70),  GroEL,  Hsp15  [14,  38-40]. 
As mentioned earlier, some proteins appeared  in  more  than 
one spot, such as the known chaperones, DnaK (LIC10524) 
and GroEL (LIC11335) that were identified in 2 and 5 spots, 
respectively. The elongation factor Tu (LIC12875) was iden-
tified 10 times in one gel and 5 times in the other. Further-
more,  the  membrane  lipoproteins  OmpA-like  (LIC10191), 
LipL32  (LIC11352),  LipL45  (LIC11643),  and  LipL41 
(LIC12966),  the  flagellins  LIC11531  and  LIC11890,  the 
ATP synthase subunits A and B (LIC11241 and LIC11243), 
and 
the  hypothetical  proteins  LIC11848,  LIC12621, 
LIC13050  and  LIC13166  were  also  the  proteins  observed  
in  the  multiple  spots  over  the  gels.  In  the  case  of  LipL32, 
distinct  molecular  mass forms and pI  isoforms were shown 
to comprise approximately 31% of the gel-separated protein 
spots  of  Triton  X-114-derived  OMPs  [19].  We  have  also 
validated the expression of 8 proteins assigned as hypotheti-
cal by genome annotation, that are absent in the saprophytic 
non-pathogenic L. biflexa, a data that may implicate them in 
leptospiral pathogenesis. 
 
In conclusion, we report for the first time the proteomic 
analysis of whole-cell, low-passage virulent strain,  L.  inter-
rogans  serovar  Pomona  sub-cultured  from  kidney  and  liver 
of infected hamsters. We have analyzed 895 spots and identi-
fied  286  of  them  as  leptospiral  proteins  that  corresponded  
to  108  different  proteins  -  the  highest  number  of  proteins 
recognized  by  proteomics  to  date  [15,  16,  18,  19].  These 
proteins  are  assigned  in  all  functional  categories  and  
allocated  in  all  bacterial  cell  compartments.  We  have  
validated the expression of 27 novel hypothetical leptospiral 
proteins,  5  of  them  containing  SpI  or  SpII  signal  peptide 
cleavage  sites  and  8  that  are  absent  in  the  non-pathogenic  
L.  biflexa.  We  trust  that,  the  global  snapshot  of  proteome  
of  L.  interrogans  expressed  by  virulent  strain  presented  
in  this  study  would  help  to  identify  proteins  of  importance  
in  pathogenesis,  and  hence,  potential  antigens  for  the  
development of vaccine against leptospirosis.
