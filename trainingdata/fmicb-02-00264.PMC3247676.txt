Retroviruses can cause diseases such as AIDS, leukemia, and tumors, but are also used
as vectors for human gene therapy. All retroviruses, except foamy viruses, package two
copies of unspliced genomic RNA into their progeny viruses. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms of retroviral genome packaging will aid the design of new anti-retroviral drugs
targeting the packaging process and improve the efﬁcacy of retroviral vectors. Retroviral
genomes have to be speciﬁcally recognized by the cognate nucleocapsid domain of the Gag
polyprotein from among an excess of cellular and spliced viral mRNA. Extensive virological
and structural studies have revealed how retroviral genomic RNA is selectively packaged
into the viral particles. The genomic area responsible for the packaging is generally located
in the 5(cid:2) untranslated region (5(cid:2) UTR), and contains dimerization site(s). Recent studies have
shown that retroviral genome packaging is modulated by structural changes of RNA at the
5(cid:2) UTR accompanied by the dimerization. In this review, we focus on three representative
retroviruses, Moloney murine leukemia virus, human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 and
2, and describe the molecular mechanism of retroviral genome packaging.

INTRODUCTION
Retroviruses belong to a diverse family of RNA viruses caus-
ing various diseases, such as leukemia, tumors, demyelinization
disease, and AIDS. One unique feature of retroviruses is their
integration of reverse transcribed genome into the host chromo-
some as a provirus. Some retroviruses have been engineered to
function as vectors for the delivery of corrective human genes,
and vectors derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus
(MoMLV) have been used for the treatment of severe combined
immunodeﬁciency (Nelson et al., 2003). An understanding of
the molecular mechanism of retroviral replication is needed for
the development of anti-retroviral therapies as well as retroviral
vectors.

All retroviruses, except foamy viruses, package two copies of
full-length genomic RNA into progeny viruses, the genomic RNA
having to be speciﬁcally selected from among a large amount of
spliced viral and cellular RNA (Figure 1; Berkowitz et al., 1996).
Virological and genetic studies have shown that the speciﬁc pack-
aging of retroviral genomic RNA is mediated via interaction with
the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of the Gag polyprotein (Rein,
1994; Berkowitz et al., 1996; Jewell and Mansky, 2000; Greatorex,
2004; Paillart et al., 2004b; Russell et al., 2004). Retroviral NC
domains are generally highly basic and contain one or two zinc
knuckle motifs composed of C–C–H–C arrays (Henderson et al.,
1981; Summers et al., 1990; Kodera et al., 1998; D’Souza and
Summers, 2004; Matsui et al., 2007). The zinc knuckles form a
metal-coordinating “reverse turn” stabilized by NH–S hydrogen
bonds. Most retroviral zinc knuckles contain a hydrophobic cleft
on the surface of the mini globular domain, recognizing spe-
ciﬁc structures of RNA or DNA. The basic N- and C-terminal

tails of NC domains are conformationally labile (Summers et al.,
1992).

Retroviral genomes are known to be non-covalently dimer-
ized in progeny virions (Rizvi and Panganiban, 1993). The region
responsible for retroviral genome packaging is generally located
between the splice donor (SD) site and the gag start codon in
(cid:2)
the 5
leader region (Watanabe and Temin, 1982; Mann and Balti-
more, 1985; Lever et al., 1989; Mansky et al., 1995; Kaye and Lever,
1999; Browning et al., 2003; Mustafa et al., 2004). Interestingly, the
packaging signal generally overlaps with the site of dimerization
(Paillart et al., 1996, 2004a; Greatorex, 2004; Hibbert et al., 2004),
implying that the packaging event is coupled with genome dimer-
ization (Russell et al., 2004). Inhibition of genome dimerization
by deletion or insertion mutations at dimer initiation sites (DIS)
causes a drastic reduction in genome packaging (Berkhout, 1996;
Paillart et al., 1996; Laughrea et al., 1997; McBride and Pangani-
ban, 1997). Moreover, studies with mutant viruses containing two
(cid:2)
5
untranslated region (UTR) packaged monomeric genome, indi-
cate that genome packaging is achieved by the interaction of two
(cid:2)
5
UTRs (Sakuragi et al., 2001, 2002). Experiments with MoMLV
have indicated that the conformational change induced by genome
dimerization causes the exposure of NC-binding sites (D’Souza
and Summers, 2004). A recent study also indicated that human
immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) employs a similar strat-
egy for genome packaging (Lu et al., 2011a). In addition, several
structures have been determined among complexes of NC and
RNA fragments functioning in genome packaging, which provide
the molecular mechanism for retroviral genome recognition of
NC at the atomic level. In this review, we describe the molecular
mechanisms of retroviral genome packaging.

Retroviral genome packaging

retroviral genomic RNA is exported from the nucleus to cytoplasm and used
as the mRNA for ribosomal synthesis of the Gag and Gag–Pol polyproteins.
(A) The retroviral genomic RNA promotes conversion of the dimeric form of
genomic RNA via the NC domain of Gag. (B) The Gag and retroviral genomic

RNA complex is transported to the plasma membrane, where further
assembly and budding occur, mediated by the myristoylated MA domain of
Gag. (C) In contrast, spliced viral RNA or cellular RNA is not bound to the NC
domain of Gag or may be bound to a small number of Gag polyproteins
insufﬁcient for trafﬁcking to the plasma membrane.

MOLONEY MURINE LEUKEMIA VIRUS
Moloney murine leukemia virus is a simple prototypical retro-
virus, with a single splicing event producing a spliced RNA for
synthesizing Env during its life cycle. MoMLV is one of the most
(cid:2)
extensively studied retroviruses. Nucleotides 215–565 of the 5
UTR have been identiﬁed as a responsible site for genome pack-
aging (Ψ-site; Mann et al., 1983). The secondary structure of the
(cid:2)
5
UTR was determined by RNase protection assays using cross-
linking reagents combined with computational analyses such as
phylogenetic and free-energy calculations (Tounekti et al., 1992;
Mougel et al., 1993). The monomeric Ψ-site is composed of a
series of RNA stem-loops. Differences in RNase protection pat-
terns were observed for the dimeric Ψ-site (Tounekti et al., 1992;
Mougel et al., 1993; D’Souza and Summers, 2005). It was reported
that a dimerized RNA fragment containing the entire Ψ-site was
bound to a signiﬁcant number of NCs (Miyazaki et al., 2010a).
Meanwhile, a mutant RNA fragment that inhibited dimerization
was bound to a few NCs. Thus, dimerization-dependent genome
packaging is strongly indicated in MoMLV.

The minimum region sufﬁcient for genome packaging is
referred to as the core encapsidation signal (ΨCES), though a
virus containing only ΨCES exhibits less efﬁcient packaging than
a virus containing the entire Ψ-site (Bender et al., 1987; Adam
and Miller, 1988; Murphy and Goff, 1989; Mougel and Barklis,
1997; Yu et al., 2000). ΨCES consists of three RNA stem-loops
(DIS-2, SL-C, and SL-D, see Figures 2A,B). DIS-2 harbors a palin-
dromic sequence and is able to convert heterologous extended
dimers. The structure of NC in a complex with a mutant RNA of
ΨCES mimicking the dimer-like conformation was determined by
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Figures 2C,D;
D’Souza and Summers, 2004). UAUCUG residues sequestered by

base-pairing in the monomeric conformation are exposed as a
linker by dimerization. NC recognizes the UCUG sequence. NC is
a highly basic protein, consisting of a zinc knuckle motif and labile
tails in both the N- and C-terminus. Biophysical study indicated
that NC speciﬁcally recognizes RNA fragments including a Py (C
or U) – Py-Py-G sequence (Dey et al., 2005). The interface of NC–
UCUG is complementary in both shape and charge (D’Souza and
Summers, 2004; Dey et al., 2005). The guanosine base attaches to
the deep hydrophobic pocket of the zinc knuckle via hydropho-
bic and hydrogen bonds. The three upstream nucleotides make
contact with hydrophobic residues on the surface of the zinc
knuckle.

(cid:2)

SL-C and SL-D, which are part of ΨCES, promote genome
packaging (Mougel et al., 1996; Mougel and Barklis, 1997; Fisher
and Goff, 1998). Both are highly conserved among gamma-
retroviruses and contain GACG loops (Konings et al., 1992; Kim
and Tinoco, 2000; D’Souza et al., 2001). A stem loop RNA frag-
ment containing the GACG tetra-loop has a unique property (Kim
and Tinoco, 2000). The C and G (3
) residues of the loop undergo
intermolecular base-pairing (kissing interactions). This property
of the stem loop containing GACG has led to speculation that SL-
C and SL-D function in genome dimerization (Kim and Tinoco,
2000; D’Souza et al., 2001; Hibbert et al., 2004). Interestingly,
the RNA fragment of SL-C forms two alternative conformations
(one containing the GACG tetra-loop and the other, a CGAGU
loop; Miyazaki et al., 2010b). NMR data showed that SL–CD was
in a state of equilibrium between kissing and non-kissing inter-
actions even at a high sample concentration and physiological
ion-strength. The two alternative conformations of SL-C may reg-
ulate genome dimerization though the biological meaning of this
is not yet clear.

The tertiary structure of a RNA fragment of a SL–CD mutant
locking to form a single conformation containing the GACG terra-
loop was determined by NMR spectroscopy and conﬁrmed by
Cryo-electron tomography (Miyazaki et al., 2010b). The struc-
ture revealed that SL–CD is dimerized by intermolecular cross-
kissing (SL-C to SL-D
). These intermolecular
cross-kissing interactions were also proposed based on selective

and SL-D stack end to end. Consequently, the two residues at the

-end of the SL–CD dimer are separated by ∼20 Å. There are two
UCUG sequences just upstream of SL-C. The intermolecular kiss-
ing interactions of SL-C and SL-D induce the proximity of four

(cid:2)

of the NC-binding sites. The genomic RNA has been suggested to
promote the retroviral Gag/Gag interaction (Dawson and Yu, 1998;
Burniston et al., 1999; Campbell and Rein, 1999; Cimarelli et al.,
2000; Sandefur et al., 2000; Khorchid et al., 2002; Huseby et al.,
2005). Both the DIS DIS-1 and DIS-2 are followed by two UCUG
elements. The abundance and proximity of exposed UCUG and
(cid:2)
related elements within the dimeric 5
UTR may facilitate Gag–Gag
interactions (Figure 2E).

Of note, a totally different monomeric structure for a por-
tion of the Ψ-site (nucleotides 205–374) was proposed based on
SHAPE (Gherghe and Weeks, 2006), where the RNA region span-
ning nucleotides 231–315 forms a large stem-loop structure, which
contains residues corresponding to DIS-2. SL-C also differed from

the structure previously reported, where the bottom of the stem is
unstructured. It is suggested that the intermolecular kissing inter-
actions of SL-C and SL-D induce the conformational change of
SL-C and promote the dimerization of DIS-2. The difference in
RNA structures may be due to the difference of RNA fragments
used in those studies.

leader region
Virological studies have indicated the HIV-1 5
(cid:2)
including the entire 5
UTR and a portion of the gag coding
region to be involved in genome packaging (Lever et al., 1989;
Aldovini and Young, 1990; Clavel and Orenstein, 1990; Poznansky
et al., 1991; Buchschacher and Panganiban, 1992; Kim et al., 1994;
Luban and Goff, 1994; Parolin et al., 1994; Berkowitz et al., 1995;
McBride and Panganiban, 1996, 1997; McBride et al., 1997; Harri-
son et al., 1998; Helga-Maria et al., 1999; Clever et al., 2002; Russell
et al., 2002; Sakuragi et al., 2003, 2007). The 5
leader RNA con-
sists of a series of RNA stem-loops referred to as the transacting
responsive element (TAR), primer-binding site (PBS), polyadeny-
lation signal [poly(A)], DIS, SD, and residues spanning the gag
start codon (AUG; Figure 3; Hayashi et al., 1992, 1993; Baudin
et al., 1993; Skripkin et al., 1994; Clever et al., 1995; McBride and
Panganiban, 1996, 1997; Clever and Parslow, 1997; Harrison et al.,
1998; Damgaard et al., 2004; Wilkinson et al., 2008; Watts et al.,
2009). It has been suggested that an RNA fragment of the 5
leader
RNA has two alternative conformations, whose secondary struc-
ture has been determined by chemical probing assays (Berkhout
and van Wamel, 2000). One conformation is referred to as the long
distance interaction (LDI) structure, in which the residues of DIS
are base-paired with those of poly(A) and SD. The other confor-
mation is referred to as the branched multiple hairpin structure
(BMH), in which the residues of DIS, SD, and Ψ form a stem-loop
structure as indicated before (Huthoff and Berkhout, 2001). In
addition, the residues of AUG form base-pairs with the residues
of the unique 5
region (U5). Of note, it has been proposed a lot
of secondary structural models for the 5
leader (Lu et al., 2011b).
NC catalyzes LDI to BMH. DIS is exposed as a stem-loop in BMH,
which promotes the kissing dimer conformation and following the
genome packaging event. However, the BMH structure is mostly
observed in HIV-1-infected cells, but the LDI structure fails to be
detected (Paillart et al., 2004a). Thus, the biological signiﬁcance of
the BMH/LDI riboswitch model remains to be elucidated.

RNA fragments of DIS, SD, Ψ, and AUG have been studied
extensively since the region from DIS to AUG was initially identi-
ﬁed as a Ψ-site (Lever et al., 1989; Aldovini and Young, 1990; Clavel
and Orenstein, 1990; Poznansky et al., 1991; Harrison and Lever,
1992; Kim et al., 1994; McBride and Panganiban, 1996, 1997; Har-
rison et al., 1998). The RNA fragments of SD and Ψ are bound
to NC with high afﬁnity (Clever et al., 1995; Amarasinghe et al.,
2000a,b), whereas the RNA fragments of DIS and AUG are bound
to NC with relatively low afﬁnity (Darlix et al., 1990; Amaras-
inghe et al., 2001; Lawrence et al., 2003). The RNA fragment of Ψ
is bound to NC with the highest afﬁnity (K d = 100 nM) among

these four RNA fragments (Amarasinghe et al., 2000b). Deletion
or destabilization of the stem of Ψ results in a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in genome packaging efﬁciency (Clever and Parslow, 1997;
McBride and Panganiban, 1997). This indicates that the stem-loop

FIGURE 3 | (A) Genomic organization of HIV-1. (B) The latest model for
HIV-1 genome packaging. Conformational change of RNA in the 5(cid:2) leader
region regulates genome dimerization and genome packaging. The
stem-loop structure of AUG causes sequestering of DIS via long range
interaction with the residues of U5, resulting in the inhibition of HIV-1
genome dimerization (left). In this conformation of the 5(cid:2) leader RNA, a
small number of NCs are capable of binding the 5(cid:2) leader RNA. In contrast,
the interaction of AUG with U5 residues promotes genome dimerization via
exposure of DIS (center). In this conformation of the 5(cid:2) leader RNA, a
greater number of NCs are capable of binding the 5(cid:2) leader RNA. The
different RNA elements in the 5(cid:2) leader region are color coded: DIS (red),
SD (blue), Ψ (orange), and AUG (green).

structure of Ψ is important for genome packaging. Ψ consists of a
GGAG tetra-loop and a stem. The structure of the ribonucleopro-
tein complex NC–Ψ has been determined by NMR spectroscopy.
Guanosine residues of the GGAG tetra-loop are inserted into the
hydrophobic clefts of both the N- and C-terminal zinc knuckles
(De Guzman et al., 1998). The adenosine residue of the loop packs
against the N-terminal zinc knuckle and an N-terminal alpha-helix
domain binds to the major groove of the RNA stem. Thus, over-
all, NC residues are involved in binding with Ψ RNA, by which
the tight binding of NC–Ψ is achieved. In addition, the intra-
molecular interaction of two zinc knuckles may help to stabilize
the complex of NC and Ψ RNA.

The RNA fragment of SD is also bound to NC with high afﬁnity
though the binding is slightly weaker than that of Ψ (Amarasinghe
et al., 2000a). SD RNA contains a GGUG tetra-loop and a stem
containing a characteristic AUA triple base-pairing structure. All
guanosine residues of the loop inserted into the hydrophobic clefts
of zinc knuckles as observed in the complex of NC and Ψ RNA.
A major structural difference between the NC and SD RNA com-
plex and the NC and Ψ RNA complex is the orientation of the
N-terminal alpha-helix domain of NC. The domain does not stick
into SD RNA and is exposed outside of SD RNA. The N-terminal
zinc knuckle interacts with an AUA triple base-pairing motif in
the minor groove of the SD RNA stem. A mutant virus with a
disrupted lower stem structure of SD exhibited a 20% reduction
in genome packaging compared with the wild-type virus, despite
the robust binding of Ψ RNA and NC (McBride and Panganiban,

1997). Further study will be needed to clarify the link between the
tight binding of SD RNA with NC and its biological relevance.

Dimer initiation site contains a GC-rich palindromic sequence
and an inner bulge (G-AGG) in the middle of the stem. This inner
bulge is recognized by NC. As described above, guanosine residues
not in base-pairs possibly play an important role in the binding to
NC (Mihailescu and Marino, 2004). However, the binding afﬁn-
ity of NC–DIS is relatively weak (approximately ﬁve times weaker
than that of NC–SD/ Ψ; Lawrence et al., 2003). NC catalyzes the
conversion of DIS from a kissing dimer to a more stable extended
duplex conformation (Darlix et al., 1990; Feng et al., 1996). Viro-
logical studies have suggested that interaction between the two
(cid:2)
5
UTR is required for genome packaging (Sakuragi et al., 2001,
2002). A very recent study indicated that genome dimerization is
controlled by a unique strategy (Figure 3B). RNA containing the
entire 5
UTR and the ﬁrst 21 residues of the gag coding region
forms two alternative conformations (Lu et al., 2011a). In one con-
formation, DIS is sequestered via a long range interaction with U5,
which inhibits genome dimerization. In the other conformation,
DIS is exposed by release from the interaction with U5, which
promotes genome dimerization.

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

AUG was believed to form a stem-loop structure, consisting
of a GAGA tetra-loop and an unstable short stem containing two
wobble G–U base-pairs (Amarasinghe et al., 2001). The GAGA
tetra-loop is a type of GNRA (N is A, C, G, or U; R is A or G)
tetra-loop, which is frequently observed in ribosomal RNA. GNRA
tetra-loop helps fold stem-loops, and one Watson–Crick base-pair
is enough to close off the RNA fragment. However, it has been
suggested that AUG does not form a stem-loop structure and a
portion of the residues of AUG may have a long range interaction
with the residues of U5 as indicated in the BMH structure (Abbink
and Berkhout, 2003; Damgaard et al., 2004; Spriggs et al., 2008;
Wilkinson et al., 2008; Watts et al., 2009). Studies using deletion
mutants indicate that the entire 5
UTR and gag coding regions
are important for genome packaging (Buchschacher and Pangani-
ban, 1992; Luban and Goff, 1994; Parolin et al., 1994; Clever et al.,
2002; Russell et al., 2002). Evidence of the importance of long
range interactions for genome packaging was reported recently
(Figure 3B; Lu et al., 2011a). It shows that AUG regulates genome
dimerization. AUG forms two alternative conformations. One is
a stem-loop conformation as initially suggested. The other is a
complex with the residues of U5. The interaction of AUG with
U5 leads to the exposure of DIS, promoting genome dimerization.
Of note, when the residues of AUG form a stem-loop structure,
in which the dimerization of the 5
leader RNA is inhibited, a

small number of NCs can bind the 5
On the other hand, when the residues of AUG interact with the
residues of U5, a greater number of NCs can bind the 5
leader
RNA. Thus, AUG has a critical role in genome dimerization and
genome packaging. In addition, it is suggested that the residues
ranging from the end of Ψ to the start of AUG form base-pairing
with the residues of the 3
terminus of PBS. That is also proposed
by earlier work Lu et al. (2011b). In fact, Sakuragi et al. (2003,
2007) indicate these residues are indispensable both for genome
dimerization and genome packaging in vivo.

Ψ works in the model suggested by Lu et al. (2011a). This will
be the next question to answer for a better understanding of the
molecular mechanism of HIV-1 genome packaging.

HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TYPE 2
Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is one of two
human lentiviruses that can cause AIDS. HIV-1 and HIV-2 exhibit
approximately 55% nucleotide sequence identity. However, they
differ signiﬁcantly in their 5
UTR of
HIV-2 (HIV-2ROD) consists of 535 nucleotides, whereas that of
(cid:2)
HIV-1 (HIV-1NL432) consists of 335 nucleotides. The 5
leader
RNA of HIV-2 contains three unique RNA elements referred to as
Ψ-1, Ψ-2, and Ψ-3 in addition to a series of RNA stem-loops, TAR,
poly(A), PBS, DIS, SD, and AUG, those are commonly observed
leader of HIV-1 (Figure 4; Berkhout, 1996). The struc-
in the 5
ture of HIV-2 NC also exhibits some different features. A major
difference in NC between HIV-2 and HIV-1 is the structure of the
N-terminal ﬂanking domain (Berkhout, 1996; Jewell and Mansky,
2000; Matsui et al., 2009). The N-terminal domain of HIV-1 NC
forms an alpha-helix, whereas that of HIV-2 NC is too short to
do so. Another difference is the intra-molecular interaction of two
zinc knuckles of HIV-2 NC, by which HIV-2 NC forms a more
globular structure than HIV-1 NC. These structural differences of
NCs between HIV-1 and HIV-2 may affect RNA recognition.

(cid:2)

It has been suggested that Ψ-3 can be bound to NC (Tsuka-
hara et al., 1996; Damgaard et al., 1998). A study using RNase
protection assays suggested that the NC–Ψ-3 ribonucleoprotein
exhibited strong protection at the loop of Ψ-3. This was supported
by NMR experiments. The guanosine residue of the UUAGAC
loop is inserted into the hydrophobic cleft of the C-terminal zinc
knuckle (Matsui et al., 2009). The N-terminal zinc knuckle does
not bind the RNA fragment of Ψ-3. However, virological study has
suggested that Ψ-3 is not essential for either genome dimerization
or genome packaging (McCann and Lever, 1997). In agreement
with that, a recent study showed that NC binds the RNA fragment
of Ψ-3 with 100 times lower afﬁnity than HIV-1 NC binds the
RNA fragment of HIV-1 Ψ (Purzycka et al., 2011).
(K d = 100 nM), equivalent to the afﬁnity of HIV-1 Ψ RNA and the

The RNA fragment of DIS is bound to NC with high afﬁnity

cognate NC (Purzycka et al., 2011). HIV-2 NC recognizes the inner
bulge of DIS, and does not bind to the loop. HIV-1 DIS is weakly
bound to the cognate NC (Lawrence et al., 2003; Andersen et al.,
2004). Interestingly, HIV-2 TAR and poly(A) is bound to the NCs
with relatively high afﬁnity (TAR–NC Kd= 450 nM, poly(A) –
NC Kd= 550 nM). All the tight NC-binding sites [DIS, TAR, and
poly(A)] are located upstream of SD. The regions responsible
for the genome packaging of retroviruses are generally located
downstream of SD, by which the genomic RNA is selectively
packaged from an excess amount of spliced viral RNA. It is sug-
gested that HIV-2 genome packaging is primarily mediated by cis
packaging mechanism (Kaye and Lever, 1999; Grifﬁn et al., 2001;
L’Hernault et al., 2007). The Gag packages genomic RNA from
which it is translated. Therefore, the HIV-2 Gag is not required
to distinguish the genomic RNA from viral spliced RNAs. Recent

FIGURE 4 | (A) Genomic organization of HIV-2. (B) Representative secondary
structures predicted for the 5(cid:2) UTR of HIV-2. Variations among recent
predictions for AUG (green) are shown. The residues of AUG have been
suggested to form a stem-loop structure and show long range interaction

with the residues of U5. It has been suggested that HIV-2 genome’s
dimerization is employed the same mechanism as HIV-1. However, it remains
to be clear whether NC preferentially binds the 5(cid:2) leader RNA containing the
U5–AUG interaction.

studies, however, indicated that HIV-2 genome packaging is pri-
marily mediated by trans packaging mechanism (Ni et al., 2011).
TAR contains a palindromic sequence and has been suggested
to form a dimer (Berkhout et al., 1993; Andersen et al., 2004).
The dimerization of TAR may also function for efﬁcient genome
packaging. Further study will be needed to determine how the
RNA elements located upstream of SD are involved in genome
packaging.
(cid:2)

Despite signiﬁcant differences in the recognition of NC by the
5
leader RNA, HIV-1, and HIV-2 may employ similar mecha-
nisms for genome packaging. Dirac et al. (2002) observed that the
(cid:2)
RNA fragment of the 5
leader region forms two alternative con-
(cid:2)
formations as observed for the HIV-1 RNA fragments of the 5
leader region. The long range interaction of U5–AUG is observed
for the BMH conformation though it is not clear whether the
LDI/BMH riboswitch mechanism is utilized for genome packag-
ing in vivo. Recent study also indicated the U5–AUG interaction
by SHAPE analysis (Purzycka et al., 2011). Of note, it is sug-
gested that the U5–AUG interaction regulates the HIV-2 genome
dimerization as indicated in HIV-1 (Baig et al., 2008). Lu et al.
(cid:2)
(2011a) suggest that the 5
leader RNA containing the U5–AUG
interaction of HIV-1 is preferentially bound to the cognate NC.
A major question is whether the U5–AUG interaction of HIV-2
(cid:2)
leader RNA (Figure 4B).
also promotes the NC-binding to the 5

Phylogenetic and computational analyses suggested that the U5–
AUG long range interaction is widely conserved among retro-
viruses (Damgaard et al., 2004). The long range interaction of
U5–AUG may be important for retroviral genome dimerization
and genome packaging.

PERSPECTIVES
It has been indicated that the MoMLV NC domain of Gag binds
predominantly to dimeric genomes (D’Souza and Summers, 2004;
Miyazaki et al., 2010a). HIV-1 was indicated to have a similar
system (Lu et al., 2011a). MoMLV showed proximal NC-binding
motifs in ΨCES, implying that Gag–Gag multimerization is initi-
ated by genomic RNA (Miyazaki et al., 2010b). A major question
is whether the proximity of NC-binding motifs is observed for
other retroviruses such as HIV-1 and HIV-2. In addition, is the
proximity of NC-binding motifs essential for retroviral genome
packaging? Further study for these questions will lead to a better
understanding for the molecular mechanism underlying retroviral
genome packaging.
