Abstract:  Internalization  of  PAK  strain  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  into  human  respiratory  epithelial  cell  lines  and  HeLa 
cervical  cancer  cells  in  vitro  was  readily  demonstrable  via  a  gentamycin  protection  assay.  Depletion  of  target  cell  gly-
cosphingolipids (GSLs) using a glucosyl ceramide synthase inhibitor, P4, completely prevented P. aeruginosa internaliza-
tion. In contrast, P4 treatment had no effect on the internalization of Salmonella typhimurium into HeLa cells. Internalized 
P.  aeruginosa  were  within  membrane  vacuoles,  often  containing  microvesicles,  between  the  bacterium  and  the  limiting 
membrane.  P.  aeruginosa  internalization  was  markedly  enhanced  by  target  cell  pretreatment  with  the  exogenous  GSL, 
deacetyl gangliotetraosyl ceramide (Gg4). Gg4 binds the lipid raft marker, GM1 ganglioside. Target cell pretreatment with 
TLCK,  but  not  other  (serine)  protease  inhibitors,  prevented  both  P.  aeruginosa  host  cell  binding  and  internalization. 
NFkB  inhibition  also  prevented  internalization.  A  GSL-containing  lipid-raft  model  of  P.  aeruginosa  host  cell  bind-
ing/internalization is proposed.

INTRODUCTION 

  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  is  an  opportunistic  pathogen 
primarily  associated  with  the  lung  pathology  and  morbidity 
of  cystic  fibrosis  patients  [1].  It  is  highly  motile  due  to  fla-
gella  and  type  4  pili  (T4P)-mediated  twitching  [2].  T4P  are 
also  involved  in  attachment  of  the  organism  to  both  target 
cells  and  inert  surfaces  [3].  The  organism  is  also  prone  to 
form  T4P  dependent  biofilms  [4],  sessile  protected  micro-
colonies,  at  the  site  of  infection  making  antibiotic  manage-
ment difficult [5]. P. aeruginosa expresses a broad spectrum 
of pathological virulence factors responsible for disease [6].  

  The  organism  is  largely  an  extracellular  pathogen,  how-
ever,  internalization  of  P.  aeruginosa  into  target  cells  has 
been  reported  [7,  8].  This  internalization  process  has  been 
proposed  to  be,  in  part,  responsible  for  the  normal  elimina-
tion  of  the  organism  by  induction  of  host  cell  apoptosis  and 
macrophage clearance, a process proposed deficient in cystic 
fibrosis cells [9].  

  The  neutral  glycosphingolipid  (GSL)  gangliotetraosyl 
ceramide,  Gg4  (also  referred  to  as  asialoGM1)  has  been  re-
ported  to  bind  many  pathogenic  bacteria  including  P.  aeru-
ginosa [10, 11]. Gg4 has been proposed to provide the respi-
ratory  epithelial  cell  receptor  for  P.  aeruginosa  infection 
[12-16].  Gg4  expression  levels  have  been  shown  to  be  
increased  in  epithelial  cells  derived  from  cystic  fibrosis  
patients,  consistent  with  their  enhanced  susceptibility  to

infection [17]. We have verified increased Gg4 expression in 
a  CF-derived  respiratory  cell  line  [18].  However,  we  also 
demonstrated  that  P.  aeruginosa  does  not  bind  to  Gg4  in 
solid  phase  binding  assays  or  when  expressed  within  the 
plasma membrane of target host cells [18]. We did neverthe-
less, find that T4P sheared from the P. aeruginosa organism 
could specifically bind Gg4 (and Gg3) in an in vitro receptor 
ELISA.  We  therefore,  have  continued  to  explore  the  poten-
tial role of GSLs in P.aeruginosa pathology. 

Internalization of the standard PAK P.aeruginosa labora-
 
tory  strain  into  eukaryotic  cells  is  src  kinase  dependent  [19-
21]  and  is  modulated  by  CFTR  and  caveolin1  [8].  We  now 
show  the  P.  aeruginosa  internalization  pathway  is  a  GSL-
dependent process. Prevention of binding and internalization 
by protease inhibition suggests a novel src kinase dependent 
P.aeruginosa host cell interaction mechanism. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Bacterial Strains and Cultured Cells 

  P.  aeruginosa  strains  PAK  [22],  PAK-np  (kindly  
provided  by  Dr  L.  Burrows,  McMaster  University),  and  
Salmonella  typhimurium  SL  1344  were  maintained  in  
glycerol  at  -80  ºC.  Bacteria  were  grown  on  Luria-Bertani 
(LB)  agar  plates,  over  night  at  37  ºC  prior  to  epithelial  cell 
infection.  IB3-1  (derived  from  a  CF  patient  with  (cid:1)F508/ 
W1282X  mutant  CFTR)  and  S9  (transfected  IB3-1  cells 
transfected with full length wildtype CFTR) brochial epithe-
lial  cells  were  grown  as  previously  [18].  HeLa  cervical 
epithelial  carcinoma  cells  were  from  ATCC  and  maintained 
as described [23].

GSL Depletion 

P4  (1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol) 
 
was  a  generous  gift  from  Dr.  J.  Shayman,  University  of 
Michigan. It is an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, the 
enzyme catalyzing the first glycosylation step in the synthe-
sis  of  glucosylceramide-based  glycosphingolipids  [24]  to 
prevent the synthesis of most gangliosides and neutral GSLs. 
IB3-1-1, S9 and HeLa cells were maintained in medium con-
taining 1(cid:1)M P4 reconstituted in DMSO, for at least 10 days 
as previously [18]. To test the effect of selective neutral GSL 
depletion on P. aeruginosa internalization, cells were treated 
with  8(cid:1)M  cyclosporine  A  [25]  for  a  minimum  of  3  days 
prior to confluency and bacterial internalization assay.  

Synthesis of Deacetyl Gangliotetraosyl Ceramide 
  A solution of gangliotetraosyl ceramide (Gg4, 2 mgs, 1.5 
μmol,  weighted  average  molecular  weight,  1291.8  gmol-1, 
prepared  from  acid  hydrolysis  of  GM1  ganglioside  [26]), 
was portioned into a reaction tube and dried under a flow of 
nitrogen.  Sample  was  kept  under  vacuum  in  a  desiccator 
containing phosphorus pentoxide for 6 hours. The dry sam-
ple  was  dissolved  in  methanolic  NaOH  (2  mLs  of  1  M 
NaOH  in  dry  MeOH),  sonicated  and  heated  at  72  to  74   C 
for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled  to room tem-
perature,  neutralized  with  HCl  (6  M  HCl)  and  most  of  the 
methanol  was  removed  under  vacuum  to  yield  a  syrupy  
material.  This  material  was  dissolved  in  water  (15  mLs), 
desalted on a C-18 reverse phase column and the methanolic 
fraction  was  dried.  Sample  was  then  dissolved  in  CHCl3: 
MeOH: H2O; 90: 10: 0.5 (3 mLs) and loaded on to a silica 
column  (silica:  35-70  micrones,  suspended  in  CHCl3: 
MeOH;  98:  2,  bed  volume:  1.5  cm  o.  d.,  2  cm  height)  
column and eluted with the following solvents; C: M: H2O; 
90:15:1 (1, 15 mL fraction), C: M: H2O; 80: 20: 2 (6, 2 mL 
fractions), C: M: H2O; 65: 25: 4 (until product was eluted).  

TLC Overlay to Detect GSL-GSL Binding 
 
2(cid:1)g GSL were spotted on TLC. Plates were blocked for 
1hr  at  room  temp.  with1%BSA  in  PBS  and  washed  3x  in 
PBS. The plates were incubated with 10(cid:1)g/mL Gg4 in RPMI 
1640  containing  10%  FBS  for  30  mins  at  37oC.  The  plates 
were  washed  and  incubated  with  Mab  antiGg4  for  2  hr  at 
room  temp.,  washed,  and  incubated  with  HRP  conjugated 
anti mouse  antibody for 1hr. After  washing, bound antiGg4 
was detected using 4-chloronaphthol. 

Gentamycin  Resistance  Assay  for  Quantification  of  
Internalized Bacteria 
 
IB3-1  and  S9  cells  P4  treated  and  untreated  were  
grown in LHC-8  media. HeLa  cells were grown in DMEM 
media.  All  cell  lines  were  grown  in  6  or  12  well  plates  at 
37ºC to reach  confluency for internalization assay.  Bacteria 
were grown on LB plates over night, scraped from the plate 
and  washed  in  PBS  by  centrifugation  at  3000  r.p.m.  for  5 
minutes.  They  were  resuspended  in  RPMI-160  with  10% 
fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS)  supplemented  with  1%  Hepes 
buffer to OD of 0.07-0.09 (~ 108 bacteria ml-1).  Salmonella 
typhimurium was grown in 2 ml LB broth with 50 (cid:1)g/ml of 
gentamycin at 37 ºC, over night  to remove  any hypersensi-
tive organisms, and subcultured (300 (cid:1)l was added to 10 ml 
of LB) for a further 3 hours at 37 ºC. The culture was then 

centrifuged  at  10000g  for  2  minutes,  resuspended  in  PBS 
supplied  with  Mg2+  and  Ca2+ and  adjusted  to  an  OD  of  0.1 
prior  to  infection.  Bacterial  cultures  were  confirmed  to  be 
100%  susceptible  to  400(cid:1)g/mL  gentamycin.  Cells  were  in-
fected  with  bacteria  (M.O.I  of  ~100)  for  30  minutes.  This 
time was the maximum under which P.aeruginosa host cell 
binding  was  T4P-dependent  [18].  Unbound  bacteria  were 
washed off three times with PBS. The remaining extracellu-
lar  bacteria  were  killed  with  400  (cid:1)g.ml-1  gentamycin  in 
RPMI  1640,  for  2  hours  at  37  ºC.  Cells  from  at  least  three 
wells  were  washed  and  lysed  with  0.5%  Triton  X-100 
(Sigma)  in  PBS  for  15  minutes  at  room  temperature.  Ali-
quots of cell lysates were serially diluted  and plated on LB 
plates. The plates were incubated over night at 37 ºC and the 
colonies were counted the next day.  
  To test the effect of soluble GSL analogues or inhibitors 
on P. aeruginosa internalization, epithelial cells were grown 
in  96  well  plates  just  to  confluency  and  preincubated  with 
varying  concentrations  of  the  compounds  for  30  minutes. 
Cells  were  washed  with  medium  3x  prior  to  P.  aeruginosa 
infection and internalization. 

Statistical Analysis 
  Data  for  gentamycin  protection  assays  are  reported  as  a 
mean of at least three experiments with error bars represent-
ing  standard  deviation.  Significance  was  calculated  using  a 
two-tailed  t-test  with  significance  defined  and  a  p  value  of 
less than 0.05. 

Electron Microscopy TEM 
 
For  transmission  electron  microscopy,  S9,  IB3-1-1  and 
P4  treated  S9  cells  were  grown  in  10-cm-diameter  tissue 
culture  dishes  until  confluent.  The  cells  were  then  infected 
with P. aeruginosa PAK, as described above. After washing 
six times in PBS to remove nonadherent bacteria, the mono-
layers were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1  M phos-
phate  buffer,  pH  7.4,  for  10  minutes  at  room  temperature. 
Cells were scraped from the tissue culture dishes and centri-
fuged  at  600  rpm  in  the  buffered  fixative.  The  cell  pellets 
were next postfixed in 1% aqueous osmium tetroxide for 1 h. 
Dehydration was then performed in graded acetone, followed 
by embedding in epoxy resin. Osmium fixation, dehydration, 
and embedding were conducted  in  a Pelco  Biowave micro-
wave  oven  (Pelco  International,  Redding,  CA).  One-
micrometer-thick  sections  were  stained  with  toluidine  blue, 
and  ultrathin  sections  were  stained  with  uranyl  acetate  and 
lead  citrate.  Transmission  electron  microscopy  examination 
was  performed  using  a  JEM  1011  (Joel  USA  Corp., 
Peabody, MA) transmission electron microscope with a CCD 
camera system (AMT, USA.) attached.  

RESULTS 
GSL Dependency of P. aeruginosa Invasion  
  P.  aeruginosa  internalization  into  IB3-1  and  S9  cells 
could  be  readily  detected  by  protection  from  gentamycin. 
There  was  no  significant  difference  between  internalization 
into  these  cell  lines  (Fig.  1).  P.  aeruginosa  internalization 
into HeLa cells was slightly less effective. Although we have 
shown  that  GSL  depletion  of  target  cells  has  no  effect  on 
initial P.  aeruginosa adhesion [18], depletion of neutral and

acidic host cell GSLs by P4 had a major inhibitory effect on 
P.  aeruginosa  internalization  in  S9,  IB3-1  and  HeLa  cells 
(Fig.  1a).  In  contrast,  selective  inhibition  of  neutral  GSL 
biosynthesis  with  cyclosporin  had  little  inhibitory  effect  
(Fig. 1b), indicating the acidic ganglioside GSL fraction was 
of  primary  importance.  Internalization  was  pili  dependent 

since the T4P mutant P. aeruginosa strain did not internalize 
(Fig.  1c).  However,  this  may  result  from  the  lack  of  cell 
attachment seen for this mutant [18]. 

  We  compared  the  effect  of  GSL  depletion  on  the  inter-
nalization of P. aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium into

experiments. Internalization was unaffected by P4 treatment 

the same cells viz HeLa cells, commonly used in the study of 
Salmonella  internalization,  and  S9  cells.  Salmonella  typhi-
murium is an obligate intracellular pathogen and the mecha-
nism  of  host  cell  invasion  is  well  characterized,  involving  a 
type  III  secretion  system  [27,  28].  Although  interaction  be-
tween Salmonella components and host cell GSLs have been 
reported [29], no role  in internalization has been  implied. In 
contrast  to  P.  aeruginosa,  Salmonella  internalization  into 
either  S9  or  HeLa  cells  was  unaffected  by  GSL  depletion 
(Fig. 2). 

P. aeruginosa Containing Vacuoles  

  Electron  microscopy  showed  that  the  GSL-dependent 
internalized  P.  aeruginosa  were  contained  within  tightly 
apposed  membrane  vacuoles  (Fig.  3a,b).  In  cross  section, 
only  a  single  organism  per  vacuole  was  seen  (Fig.  3b  A). 
Occasional  longitudinal  sections  showed  two,  head  to  head 
organisms. Organisms near the cell periphery tended to show 
close apposition of bacterial and host vacuole membrane. In 
the  more  central vacuoles  in  the  cell,  a  significant space be-

tween  these  membrane  was  observed  and  this  space  con-
tained very small bilayer vesicles (Fig. 3b  E,F). A few  such 
vesicles  could  be  distinguished  between  the  bacterium  and 
host membrane even in the tightly enveloped vacuole. 

GSL Stimulation of P. aeruginosa Invasion  

  Although P. aeruginosa do not bind GSLs on target cells, 
we  established  that  the  type  IV  pili  (T4P)  when  released 
from the organism, can in fact, bind Gg4 [18]. Since the pili 
are  lost  from  internalized  P.  aeruginosa,  we  questioned 
whether the GSL binding T4P phenotype played any role  in 
GSL  dependent  P.  aeruginosa  invasion.  As  a  first  step,  po-
tentially  competitive  exogenous  GSLs  were  tested.  Pretreat-
ment of S9 or IB3-1 cells with purified deacetylGg4 resulted 
in  a  remarkable  stimulation  of P.  aeruginosa  internalization 
(Fig. 4). Gg4 had a similar, but less potent stimulatory effect. 
A  control  GSL  analogue  deacetylGb4,  had  no  effect.  When 
cells  were  pretreated  with  P4  to  deplete  endogenous  GSLs, 
deacetylGg4  stimulation  less,  suggesting  endogenous  GSLs 
play  a  role  in  the  stimulation.  To  determine  whether  the

apposed to the bacterium for organisms proximal to the cell surface (A,B,C). For more distal vesicles, a space between these membranes is 
apparent (B,C). This space contains microvesicles (D-F) associated with both the host (D,E) and bacterial (E,F) membranes. No overt mor-
phological distinction was seen for the few P. aeruginosa containing vesicles in P4 treated cells.

cin protection assay. A shows the results of internalization by S9, B shows internalization by IB3-1, after pretreatment with deacetylGg4. C

effect of BAPTA on P. aeruginosa internalization into  IB3-1  cells. P. aeruginosa  internalization  is  significantly  enhanced by pretreatment 
with deacetylGg4 but not deacetylGb4. Native Gg4 is less effective and deacetylGg4 stimulation is not significant for P4 treated cells. Calcium 
chelation by BAPTA does not affect internalization indicating no role for GSL regulated purine receptors. The concentration of exogenous 
GSL analogues in (cid:1)g/mL are shown. Data represent means ± SD of three experiments. * indicates p<0.05. 

known  linkage  between  Gg4  and  calcium-dependent  purine 
nucleotide  receptor  signaling  [30,  31]  could  play  a  role,  the 
effect  of  the  standard  calcium  chelator,  BAPTA  [32]  was 
assessed.  This  did  not  reduce  P.  aeruginosa  internalization, 
suggesting that  the  BAPTA-sensitive purine receptor  signal-
ing pathway is not involved. 

DeacetylGg4 Binds to GM1 Ganglioside 

 
Since  GSL  depletion  was  found  to  reduce  deacetylGg4 
stimulated  P.  aeruginosa  internalization,  we  considered 
whether endogenous GSLs could play a role in this process. 
We  assessed  whether  a  carbohydrate-carbohydrate  interac-
tion might be important by determining the direct interaction 

Glycolipid-Dependent, Protease Sensitive Internalization

of  deacetylGg4  with  a  panel  of  purified  GSLs  by  using  a 
TLC overlay immunodetection procedure (Fig. 5). We found 
significant  binding  to  GM1  ganglioside,  Gg3  and  lactosyl 
ceramide  (LacCer).  No  binding  to  Gb4  was  observed.  The 
lack  of  binding  to  GM3  as  compared  to  strong  binding  to 
LacCer,  indicates  charge  plays  no  role,  or  even  inhibits, 
deacetylGg4–GSL binding. 

Protease Inhibition Prevents P. aeruginosa Epithelial Cell 
Invasion  

S9 represents wildtype respiratory epithelial cells, strongly 
 
protected  by  GSL  depletion.  Brief  pretreatment  of  the  S9 
cells  with  the  trypsin  inhibitor,  TLCK  prevented  P.  aerugi-
nosa internalization as effectively as GSL depletion (Fig. 6). 
Elimination  of  the  antibiotic  treatment  to  assess  cell  bound, 
in  addition  to  internalized  organisms  (Fig.  6B)  shows  that 
TLCK  reduces  P.  aeruginosa  cell  binding,  in  addition  to 
internalization.  We  estimate  1  organism  is  internalized/100 
untreated  cells  and  previous  assessment  of  binding  [18] 
shows  ~4  organisms  bound/cell,  giving  an  internalization 
efficiency  of  ~0.25%.  Thus  TLCK  treatment  of  target  cells 
prevents  >99%  P.  aeruginosa  cell  binding.  The  inhibitory 
effect  was  not  a  consequence  of  trypsin  inhibition  since  the 
trypsin inhibitor, AEBSF was without effect. 

  TLCK  also  is  active  against  some  serine  proteases  such 
as  thrombin  and  plasmin  and  some  cysteine  proteases  such

as  papain.  In  addition,  TLCK  is  a  selective  inhibitor  of 
NF(cid:1)B  [33].  In  preliminary  studies,  we  established  that  the 
NF(cid:1)B  inhibitor,  PPM-18  [34]  also  prevented  P.  aeruginosa 
internalization  (Fig.  6C  panel  A),  suggesting  that  this  tran-
scription  factor  could  be  involved  in  the  GSL  dependent  P. 
aeruginosa  entry  process.  Suramin,  an  inhibitor  of  tyrosine 
phosphatases  [35],  CFTR  [36]  and  serine  proteases  [37],  
had  no  significant  effect  on  P.  aeruginosa  internalization 
(Fig. 6C panel B). 

DISCUSSION 

GSL Dependent Internalization  

  We have shown a GSL-dependent pathway for the selec-
tive  internalization  of  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  into  human 
epithelial  cells. Treatment of  target  cells with P4 under con-
ditions to completely deplete GSLs [18] prevents internaliza-
tion.  This  is  not  a  general  prevention  of  bacterial  invasion 
since Salmonella internalization is unaffected. P. aeruginosa 
without  T4P  were  not  internalized  but  this  mutant  is  defec-
tive  in  target  cell  binding  [18]  which  is  likely  a  crucial  step 
for  internalization.  The  intracellular  vacuoles  containing  P. 
aeruginosa  are  morphologically  consistent  with  previous 
studies on P. aeruginosa invasion [38] in which the vacuoles 
were defined as endosomes fused with secondary lysosomes 
[39].  PLC-dependent  vaculolar  membrane  destruction  and 
free  cytosolic  bacteria  have  been  observed  within  one  hour 
[39].  While  free  cytosolic  bacteria  were  not  found  in  our 
short-term studies, the small intravacuolar vesicles observed 
for  the  more  distal  organisms  could  represent  an  early  stage 
of  this  escape  process.  P.  aeruginosa  produce  such  vesicles 
in culture and these contain virulence factors including PLC 
and proteases [40]. These vesicles are increased by gentamy-
cin treatment, but gentamycin was not used  in our EM stud-
ies.  Moreover,  bacteria  more  distant  from  the  plasma  mem-
brane  were  associated  with  more  vesicles  than  those  more 
proximal to the cell surface, presumably more recently inter-
nalized, and a vesicle-containing space between the bacterial 
and  host  cell  membranes  becomes  apparent.  This  would  be 
consistent  with  intracellular  induction  of  bacterially  derived 
vesicle  formation  and  the  destruction  of  the  host  vacuolar 
membrane by the hydrolytic enzymes they contain. 

GSLs and Src Kinase Rafts  

  P. aeruginosa host cell invasion is dependent on tyrosine 
phosphorylation  and  inhibition  of  lipid  raft  associated  src 
kinases  [19-21,  41]  or  the  src-related  Abl  kinase  [42]  pre-
vents  internalization  without  affecting  P.  aeruginosa  cell 
binding.  Raft  depletion  per  se,  via  cholesterol  restriction, 
also  prevents  internalization  [41,  43]  and  depletion  of  the 
cholesterol  binding  caveolin1  also  restricts  entry  [8].  Src 
kinases  are  found  associated  with  the  cytosolic  face  of  GSL 
enriched plasma membrane lipid microdomains or rafts [44]. 
Lipid  rafts  containing  CFTR  have  been  implicated  in  P. 
aeruginosa internalization [8, 45 , 46]. Gangliosides, particu-
larly  GM3  [47-50],  have  been  found  associated  with  Src 
kinases and have been shown to modulate Src kinase activity 
[51].  These  GM3/src  kinase  containing  domains  have  been 
termed  a  ‘glycosynapse’  [52].  GM3  can  selectively  recruit 
Csk,  a  negative  regulator  of  src  kinase,  to  such  a  glycosyn-
apse  [53].  Gangliosides  can  also  modulate  growth  factor

receptor kinase activity within lipid rafts [54, 55]. Thus, GSL 
modulation of raft kinase signaling may provide the basis of 
the  GSL  dependent  P.aeruginosa  internalization  we  have 
found. 

 
Inhibition  of  glucosyl  ceramide  synthase  prevents  the 
synthesis  of  most  GSLs(neutral  and  acidic)  [24].  A  few  ga-
lactosyl  ceramide-based  GSLs  (primarily  galactosyl  cera-
mide  and  sulfogalactosyl  ceramide)  remain  unaffected.  We 
have previously shown that inhibition of MDR1 by inhibitors 
such  as  CsA,  results  in  the  depletion  of  cell  neutral  GSLs 
without  affecting  the  acidic  ganglioside  fraction  [25,  56]. 
Our  finding  that  P4  was  more  effective  to  prevent  internali-
zation than cyclosporin A, may therefore implicate target cell 
gangliosides in this process. GM1 is the major ganglioside of 
many cells and is used as the gold standard lipid raft marker 
in  many  studies  [57].  GSL-enriched  lipid  rafts  are  involved 
in  the  internalization  of  many  microbial  pathogens  [58]  in-
cluding  P.  aeruginosa  [41  ,  43].  Stimulation  of  P.  aerugi-
nosa internalization by pretreatment of target cells with Gg4, 
might  indicate  that  raft  GM1  mediates  the  GSL-dependent 
internalization pathway, if Gg4 was sialylated to form  GM1. 
Gg4  has  been  shown  to  accumulate  in  CF  cells  [17,  59]  and 
we have verified this for IB3-1 versus S9 cells [18]. The Gg4 
accumulation  in  CF  cells  has  been  ascribed  to  a  defect  in 
sialylation  [60]  (which  would  reduce  GM1  synthesis),  in-
duced  by  an  altered  Golgi  pH  in  CF  cells,  resulting  in  the 
accumulation  of  Gg4  [61].  However,  the  common  GM1  is 
GM1a in which the sialic acid is linked to the internal galac-
tose.  Gg4  (asialoGM1)  is  not  the  precursor  of  GM1a  and 
therefore, lack of sialylation would not result in Gg4 accumu-
lation. Thus, exogenously added (or endogenous) Gg4 would 
not be anabolized to generate GM1a ganglioside.  

  Ligation  of  Gg4  has  been  shown  to  mediate  signal  trans-
duction  through  the  purine  nucleotide  receptor  [31]  to  acti-
vate  Erk  kinase  and  this  has  been  shown  to  augment  signal-
ing  through  Toll-like  receptor  5  [30].  However,  this  process 
of  Erk  activation  has  been  shown  to  be  strictly  calcium  de-
pendent  and  we  were  unable  to  demonstrate  any  effect  of 
calcium  chelation  in  our  studies,  suggesting  that  Gg4/purine 
nucleotide receptor signaling is not central. 

  GSLs are poorly water-soluble and this hampers their use 
as pharmacological tools. We have designed a procedure for 
the generation of soluble GSL mimics which retain bioactiv-
ity  by  exchanging  the  GSL  fatty  acid  for  an  adamantane 
frame  [62].  The  generation  of  such  mimics  for  aminosugar 
containing GSLs is more complex since deacetylation of the 
amino sugar can be a confounding problem. We have devel-
oped procedures for  the selective deacetylation/reacetylation 
of amino sugars and deacylation/reacylation of the sphingoid 
base  [63].  In  the  present  studies  however,  we  found  that 
deacetylation of the amino sugar of Gg4 alone was sufficient 
to  engender  significant  water  solubility,  likely  due  to  the 
generation  of  the  charged  amino  function.  DeacetylGg4  was 
more stimulatory for internalization than was Gg4 itself, and 
exogenous  Gg4  has  been  previously  reported  to  stimulate  P. 
aeruginosa internalization [15]. Pretreatment of the bacteria, 
rather  than  target  cells,  with  deacetylGg4  had  no  effect  on 
subsequent  target  cell  internalization.  Thus,  the  effect  is  de-
pendent  on  host  cell  factors.  In  the  time  frame  of  our  ex-
periments, exogenous deacetylGg4 could be reacetylated and 
incorporated  as  a  plasma  membrane  component.  IB3-1  cells 
contain  more  endogenous  Gg4  than  S9  cells  and  the  surface 
expression  of  Gg4  in  IB3-1  cells  is  much  greater  than  S9 
cells (barely detectable) [18]. Since IB3-1 cells were slightly

less susceptible to P. aeruginosa internalization, a direct role 
for endogenous Gg4 is unlikely.  

sion.  GM1  binding  by  exogenous  Gg4  could  modulate  this 
pathway. 

  The  role  of  cell  internalization  in  clinical  P.  aeruginosa 
pathology,  particularly  in  cystic  fibrosis,  remains  controver-
sial. Defective binding and internalization in CFTR deficient 
cells  may  reduce  apoptosis  to  promote  inflammation  in  CF 
[9].  However,  P.  aeruginosa  host  cell  binding  can  be  inde-
pendent  of  CFTR  surface  expression  [18,  64].  Despite  the 
significantly increased Gg4 content of IB3-1 compared to S9 
cells [18], GSL dependent P. aeruginosa internalization was 
not  significantly  different  from  S9  cells.  Although  our  stud-
ies  only  define  a  virulence  mechanism  of  P.  aeruginosa, 
rather  than,  as yet, provide insight  into  the pathology of this 
infection  in  cystic  fibrosis,  inhibition  of  epithelial  cell  GSL 
synthesis  (by  an  inhibitor  of  glucosyl  ceramide  synthase 
similar  in  action  to  P4)  results  in  the  loss  of  P.  aeruginosa 
induced inflammation [65]. 

  Our  studies  infer  a  greater  importance  of  gangliosides  in 
P.  aeruginosa  internalization  and  inhibition  of  endogenous 
GSL synthesis compromised the stimulatory effect of exoge-
nous  deacetylGg4.  This  would  be  consistent  with  a  role  for 
endogenous GM3 ganglioside in src signaling and P. aerugi-
nosa  internalization.  Src  family  kinases  bind  the  GSLs,  sul-
fogalactosyl  ceramide  and  GM3  ganglioside  in  vitro  [66]. 
GM3/src provides a potential target for deacetylGg4 stimula-
tion  of  P.  aeruginosa  internalization.  However,  our  in  vitro 
binding  assay  showed  deacetylGg4  bound  to  several  GSLs, 
but  not  GM3  ganglioside.  (Thus,  deacetylGg4-GSL  binding 
is  not  charge  dependent.)  This  previously  unreported  [67] 
carbohydrate-carbohydrate  interaction  with  GM1,  could  im-
plicate  GM1  in  the  deacetylGg4 stimulation  mechanism.  Src 
kinases  are  associated  with  cholesterol/GSL  enriched  lipid 
rafts,  marked  by  the  presence  of  GM1  ganglioside.  Src 
kinase  activity  regulates  caveolin1-mediated  caveolar  endo-
cytosis  [68]  and  decreasing  caveolin-1  decreases  P.  aerugi-
nosa internalization [8]. The stimulation of internalization by 
exogenous  Gg4  could  be  mediated  via  GM1  modulation  of 
receptor  kinase  activity  [55,  69]  within  lipid  rafts  required 
for internalization [46]. 

Serine Protease Activity  

  The protective effect of TLCK against binding may relate 
to  early  studies  showing  trypsin  increased  P.  aeruginosa 
buccal  cell  attachment  [70].  However,  AEBSF  was  ineffec-
tive,  although  this  serine  protease  inhibitor  prevents  proto-
zoan  host  cell  invasion  [71].  The  protective  effect  of  TLCK 
may thus be due to the additional inhibition of plasmin.  

  The  type  1  plasma  membrane  protein,  gp140  and  its 
plasmin  cleavage  product,  p80,  are  the  major  epithelial  sub-
strates for src family kinases [72] and are expressed in IB3-1 
and S9 cells(in progress). Proteolytic  cleavage of gp140 and 
src  mediated  tyrosine  phosphorylation  correlate  with  cell 
monolayer  [72],  and  such  wounding  predisposes  to  P.  
aeruginosa  infection  [73]  and  internalization  [74].  TLCK 
prevents  gp140  cleavage  and  suramin  increases  gp140/p80 
phosphorylation  [72].  The  molecular  basis  of  P.  aeruginosa 
host cell binding remains unclear [18] but gp140 provides an 
attractive  candidate.  Gp140  ligation 
induces  clustering 
within  lipid  rafts  [75]  necessary  for  GM1  involved,  src-
mediated  phosphorylation  and  signaling  to  alter  cell  adhe-

  The TLCK protective effect could also result from inhibi-
tory  action  on  NF(cid:1)B.  Our  demonstration  that  the  NF(cid:1)B  in-
hibitor  PPM-18,  prevented  internalization  and  that  TLCK 
prevented  target  cell  binding  as  well  as  internalization,  sug-
gest both these activities could be involved. NF(cid:1)B activation 
is  observed  within  0.25-1hr  of P.  aeruginosa exposure  [76], 
which would be in the preincubation time-frame we used for 
TLCK  and  PPM-18,  but  longer  could  be  required  for  the 
phenotypic response.  

  A model of P. aeruginosa host cell binding and internali-
zation, consistent with our findings would include: 1) exoge-
nous  GSL  modulation  of  GSL-dependent  src  family  kinase 
activity  within  lipid  rafts,  2)  a  serine  protease  sensitive  pro-
tein  (gp140?)  required  for  P.  aeruginosa  host-cell  binding 
and  3)  kinase-mediated  tyrosine  phosphorylation  cascade  to 
activate NF(cid:1)B dependent P. aeruginosa host-cell invasion. 

  P.  aeruginosa  internalization  has  been  proposed  as  an 
important  feature  of  pathogenesis  since  this  induces  target 
cell apoptosis to facilitate clearing of the organism, which is 
defective  in  the  absence  of  functional  CFTR  [9].  Without 
clearance,  epithelial  cell  synthesis  of  inflammatory  media-
tors is upregulated to exacerbate pathology. We suggest GSL 
mediated  manipulation  of  internalization  may  influence  the 
pathology of P. aeruginosa infection.
