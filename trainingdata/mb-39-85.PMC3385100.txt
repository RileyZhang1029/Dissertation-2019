We  investigated  the  effect  of  nutritional  and  environmental  factors  on  Ophiocordyceps  longissima  mycelial  growth.  The  longest
colony  diameter  was  observed  on  Schizophyllum  (mushroom)  genetics  complete  medium  plus  yeast  extract,  Schizophyllum
(mushroom)  genetics  minimal  medium,  and  Sabouraud  dextrose  agar  (SDA);  however,  malt-extract  yeast-extract  agar,  SDA
plus  yeast  extract,  yeast-extract  malt-extract  peptone  dextrose  agar,  SDA,  oatmeal  agar,  and  potato  dextrose  agar  showed
higher  mycelia  density.  A  temperature  of  25oC  was  optimum  and  7.0  was  the  optimum  pH  for  mycelial  growth.  Colony
diameter  was  similar  under  light  and  dark  conditions.  Maltose  and  yeast  extract  showed  the  highest  mycelial  growth  among
carbon  and  nitrogen  sources  respectively.  The  effect  of  mineral  salts  was  less  obvious;  however,  K3PO4  showed  slightly  better
growth  than  that  of  the  other  mineral  salts  tested.  Among  all  nutrition  sources  tested,  complex  organic  nitrogen  sources
such  as  yeast  extract,  peptone,  and  tryptone  were  best  for  mycelial  growth  of  O.  longissima.  Ophiocordyceps  longissima  com-
posite  medium,  formulated  by  adding  maltose  (2%  w/v),  yeast  extract  (1%  w/v),  and  K3PO4  (0.05%  w/v)  resulted  in  slightly
longer  colony  diameter.  In  vitro  mycelial  O.  longissima  growth  was  sustainable  and  the  production  of  fruiting  bodies  could
be  used  for  commercial  purposes  in  the  future.

Many Cordyceps species grow on nymphs (larvae) of cicada
(Cicadidae,  Homoptera)  [1-3].  One  is  C.  longissima  Koba-
yasi, which was first reported from Japan on Tanna japon-
ensis  nymphs  [2].  This  species  was  later  confirmed  in
Korea  in  1998  [4].  One  year  later,  it  was  reported  in
China  together  with  its  Hirsutella  anamorph  [5].  Li  et  al.
confirmed  the  anamorph  as  H.  longissima  Li  et  al.  [6].
Recently,  Sung  et  al.  transferred  C.  longissima  to  a  new
genus Ophiocordyceps based on a phylogenetic classification
and renamed it O. longissima (Kobayasi) Sung et al. [7].

The stromata of O. longissima are 5~20 cm long, some-
times  much  longer  (Fig.  1).  The  stroma  of  O.  longissima
is  characterized  by  a  long  stalk  with  a  terminal  clavate
fertile part without any clear demarcation between the two
parts.  Perithecia  are  ovoid  to  long  ovoid,  with  a  short
neck,  440~590 × 130~300 µm;  asci  and  secondary  spores
measure  190~350 × 5~6 µm  and  8~11 × 1~1.2 µm  respec-
tively (Figs. 2 and 3).

Cordyceps species, including cicadicolous fungi such as
O.  sobolifera,  are  regarded  as  medicinal  mushrooms  in
oriental  society  [2, 8-11].  In  this  context,  many  researchers

have begun to study cultivation characteristics of Cordyceps
and  allied  species  [5, 12-23].  Within  the  past  few  years,
O.  longissima  specimens  have  been  collected  by  the
Cordyceps  Research  Institute  (CRI),  Mushtech,  Korea  on
Mt.  Halla  at  Jeju-do  and  on  Mt.  Duryun  at  Jeollanam-do
Korea.  In  this  study,  we  provide  detailed  information  on
mycelial  growth  characteristics  of  O.  longissima  collected
in Korea for the first time.

Materials  and  Methods

Fungal  isolates. Multi-ascospore  isolates  were  derived
from  fresh  O.  longissima  specimens  CRI  C-6764,  CRI  C-
7080,  and  CRI  C-8587  following  the  method  of  Sung  et
al.  [24].  Specimen  CRI  C-6764  was  collected  on  Mt.
Duryun  at  Jeollanam-do  on  July  8,  2001.  Similarly,  two
other specimens,  CRI  C-7080  and  CRI  C-8587,  were  col-
lected  on  Mt.  Halla  at  Jeju-do  on  July  10  and  12,  2001
respectively.  The  specimens  have  been  preserved  at  CRI,
Mushtech,  Korea.  The  multi-ascospore  isolates,  after  grow-

media and incubated at 25oC for 30 days. Water agar (2%,
WA)  was  used  as  the  control.  Colony  diameter  (CD)  was
measured  in  mm  and  mycelial  density  (MD)  was  qualita-
tively  graded  as  thin  (+),  moderate  (++),  or  compact
(+++) after the incubation.

Schizophyllum  (mushroom)  genetics  minimal  medium
(MM)  and  malt-extract  yeast-extract  agar  (MYA)  showed
better  mycelial  growth  and,  hence,  were  used  for  select-
ing  the  optimum  temperature  for  growth  of  the  O. longis-
sima  isolates.  Mycelial  discs  were  inoculated  on  MM  and
MYA  agar  plates  and  incubated  at  various  temperatures
ranging  from  15~35oC  at  regular  intervals  of  5oC  for  30
days.  Similarly,  to  observe  the  effect  of  light  on  growth,
mycelial  discs  were  inoculated  on  MM  agar  plates  and
incubated  under  continuous  light  and  dark  conditions  for
30  days  at  25oC.  CD  and  MD  were  recorded  after  the
incubation, as described above.

Liquid MM (100 mL MM without agar) was prepared in
250 mL  Erlenmeyer  flasks.  The  pH  of  the  liquid  medium
was adjusted from 4.0~10.0 at intervals of 1.0 before ster-
ilization.  Five  mycelial  discs  were  inoculated  in  the  liq-
uid  medium  with  different  pH  levels  and  incubated  on  a
rotary  shaker  at  120 rpm  for  30  days  at  25oC.  The  liquid
cultures  were  then  filtered  through  Whatman  no.  2  filter
paper,  the  residual  mycelia  were  dried  at  60oC  for  24 hr,
and  the  dry  weight  (DW)  of  the  mycelium  was  measured
in g.

(2%  w/v)  in  250 mL  Erlenmeyer  flasks  were  inoculated
with  the  isolates.  Similarly,  isolates  were  inoculated  in  WA
and MM liquid media supplemented with nitrogen sources
(2%  w/v)  only.  Different  mineral  salts  (0.05%  w/v)  were
also tested  for  their  effect  on  mycelial  growth  of  O.  long-
issima  isolates  in  WA  and  MM  liquid  media.  Agar  cul-
tures  and  liquid  cultures  were  incubated  as  described
above.

Maltose  and  yeast  extract  were  the  best  carbon  and
nitrogen  sources  respectively  for  the  mycelial  growth  of
O. longissima isolates. Hence, they were added together in
the  WA  and  MM  liquid  media  at  different  ratios  of  20 : 1,
10 : 1,  5 : 1,  2 : 1,  1 : 1,  1 : 2,  1 : 5,  and  1 : 10  and  inocu-
lated with the isolates. Maltose concentration was fixed at
0.5%,  1.0%,  and  2.0%  (w/v)  for  all  ratios.  Agar  and  liq-
uid  cultures  were  incubated  as  described  above,  and  WA
medium  was  used  as  the  control.  CD  and  MD  were
recorded  on  agar  cultures,  and  DW  was  measured  in  liq-
uid cultures, as described above.

Comparison of O. longissima composite medium (OLCM)
with  MYA.  OLCM  was  prepared  by  adding  maltose,
yeast  extract,  and  K3PO4  at  concentrations  of  2%  (w/v),
1%  (w/v),  and  0.05%  (w/v),  respectively,  on  WA.  The  O.
longissima  isolates  were  inoculated  on  OLCM  and  MYA
agar  plates  and  observed  for  CD  and  MD.  WA  was  used
as the control.

Results  and  Discussion

Selection  of  optimum  medium,  temperature,  and  pH.
The CD of O. longissima isolates was relatively longer on
Schizophyllum (mushroom) genetics complete medium plus
yeast  extract,  MM,  and  Sabouraud  dextrose  agar  (SDA);
however,  compact  or  moderate  density  was  observed  on
MYA,  SDAY,  yeast-extract  malt-extract  peptone  dextrose
agar,  SDA, potato  dextrose  agar  (PDA),  and  oatmeal  agar
(Table  2).  CD  differed  among  the  isolates;  CRI  C-7080
and  CRI  C-8587  grew  faster  than  CRI  C-6764.  It  was
clear  that  media  that  induced  a  compact  density  produced
a  shorter  CD  compared  to  media  that  produced  moderate
density  (Table  2),  as  shown  in  C.  militaris  isolates  [25].
This  result  indicates  that  MD  and  CD  of  the  isolates  do
not  correlate  with  each  other  on  agar  culture.  Czapek-dox
agar  (CDA)  produced  a  thin  density  and  the  shortest  CD
in  O.  longissima  isolates,  as  reported  in  other  Cordyceps
species  [26, 27].  CDA  does  not  contain  an  organic  nitro-
gen  source,  which  may  be  why  it  could  not  support  rich
growth  of  the  O.  longissima  isolates.  Li  et  al.  [5, 6]
showed  longer  CD  of  O.  longissima  isolates  on  Czapek
agar than that on PDA, but did not report the MD. CD of
O.  longissima  isolates  in  our  study  was  generally  longer
than that of Li et al. [5, 6].

The  longest  CD  was  observed  at  25oC  (Fig.  4),  agree-

[25].  In  our  study,  the  O.  longissima  isolates  produced
reddish  white  pigmentation  under  light,  similar  to  that
observed  by  Li  et  al.  [5, 6].  In  addition  to  pigmentation,
light  also  controls  fruiting  morphology,  such  as  elonga-
tion  and  branching  in  culture  [14].  Cycles  of  dark/light
periods  may  be  critical  in  some  species  to  induce  fruiting
bodies  [16].  A  pH  of  7.0  produced  the  highest  DW,  fol-
lowed  by  pH  8.0,  which  was  similar  to  previous  studies
(Fig. 6) [14, 26, 28].

observe the effect of carbon source on mycelial growth of
O.  longissima  in  agar  culture  because  the  CD  was  too
short  in  all  carbon  sources  tested,  particularly  for  the  CRI
C-6764  isolate  (Table  3).  Furthermore,  all  carbon  sources
produced only a thin density of mycelia, showing that car-
bon sources do not sustain rich mycelial growth (Table 3).
Among  the  carbon  sources  tested,  maltose  produced  the
highest  DW  in  liquid  culture,  whereas  the  remaining  car-
bon  sources  produced  less  than  half  of  that  of  maltose.
Based on DW, maltose was the best carbon source among
those tested.

Among  the  nitrogen  sources  tested,  yeast  extract  pro-
duced  the  highest  mycelial  growth,  followed  by  peptone

ing with previous studies [5, 14, 24, 26, 28, 29]. O. longis-
sima  isolates  had  a  similar  CD  at  20oC  and  30oC,  which
was  similar  to  Metacordyceps  yongmunensis  and  O.  het-
eropoda [27, 29]. However, this was in contrast to C. car-
dinalis  that  showed  no  growth  at  30oC  and  above  [26].
Almost  no  mycelial  growth  of  O.  longissima  isolates
occurred at 15oC and 35ºC (Fig. 4).

No  obvious  difference  was  observed  in  the  CD  of  O.
longissima  between  light  and  dark  conditions  (Fig.  5).
The  prime  effect  of  light  is  the  induction  of  pigmentation

and  tryptone  in  both  agar  and  liquid  cultures  (Table  4).
Yeast  extract,  peptone,  and  tryptone  also  produced  much
better  mycelial  growth  than  the  carbon  sources.  NaNO3,
KNO3, glycine, and ammonium tartrate all produced short,
thin  densities,  as  with  WA  (Table  4).  However,  L-aspar-
agine  produced  moderate  density  and  a  similar  CD  as
NaNO3,  KNO3,  glycine,  and  ammonium  tartrate.  These
results  showed  that  complex  organic  nitrogen  sources  such
as  yeast  extract,  peptone,  and  tryptone  sustain  favorable
growth of O. longissima, as in other Cordyceps and allied
species  [25-27, 29].  Yeast  extract  was  selected  as  the  best
nitrogen  source  for  mycelial  growth  of  O.  longissima  iso-
lates  and  was  used  for  further  tests.  Mineral  salts  showed
the  poorest  mycelial  growth  among  all  nutritional  sources
tested  (Table  5).  All  mineral  salts  tested  produced  thin
MD  and  CD,  similar  to  WA.  K3PO4  showed  slightly  bet-
ter mycelial growth than that of other mineral salts. Nota-
bly,  CuSO4·5H2O  showed  a  rather shorter  CD  than  that  of
WA in all isolates (Table 5).

O.  longissima  isolates  produced  compact  MD  at  all  C/
N  ratios  (Table  6).  However,  C/N  ratios  of  2 : 1  and  1 : 1

showed  the  longest  CD  (Table  6).  Nitrogen  favors  myce-
lial  growth  but  higher  nitrogen  ratios  slowed  CD,  proba-
bly due to higher nutrient concentrations; thus, increasing the
water  potential  of  the  medium  and  consequently  decreas-
ing  the  amount  of  water  available  to  the  isolates.  A  2 : 1
C/N  ratio  was  selected  with  maltose  and  yeast  extract  at
concentrations  of  2%  and  1%,  respectively,  to  formulate
the OLCM.

Comparison  of  OLCM  with  MYA. Both  OLCM  and
MYA produced compact MD (Table 7). However, OLCM
produced  slightly  longer  CD  than  that  of  MYA.  A  higher
concentration  of  yeast  extract  is  likely  favorable  for  O.
longissima  mycelial  growth,  as  in  C.  militaris  [25].  The
medium  is  the  most  important  factor  for  mycelial  growth
and  fruiting  body  formation  in  Cordyceps  species.  Com-
monly used mycological media can support profuse myce-
lial growth  in Cordyceps  species.  In  contrast,  cereals such
as  rice,  supplemented  with  pupal  power,  sawdust,  pep-
tone,  and  yeast  extract  are  used  for  fruiting  body  produc-
tion [5, 14]. Fruiting medium is much more complex than
mycelial growth medium. Obviously, fruiting body forma-
tion is a much more complex physio- and morpho-genetic
process.  As  with  mycelial  growth,  nitrogen  sources  are
likely the most important nutritional factor for fruiting body
formation.  Fruiting  body  formation  of  O.  longissima  has
been reported by Li et al. [5, 6] in rice medium. It is con-
cluded  that  various  nutritional  and  environmental  factors
should  be  tested  to  induce  profuse  fruiting  bodies  in  O.
longissima,  so  that  it  can  be  commercially  utilized  as  a
health and medicinal food.
