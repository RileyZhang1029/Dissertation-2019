Despite nearly two score years of research on RNA secondary structure and RNA RNA inter- action prediction, the accuracy of the state-of-the-art algorithms are still far from satisfactory.
So far, researchers have proposed increas- ingly complex energy models and improved parameter estimation methods, experimental and/or computational, in anticipation of endowing their methods with enough power to solve the problem.
The output has disappointingly been only modest improvements, not matching the expectations.
Even recent massively featured machine learning approaches were not able to break the barrier.
Why is that  Approach: The first step toward high-accuracy structure prediction is to pick an energy model that is inherently capable of predicting each and every one of known structures to date.
In this article, we introduce the notion of learnability of the parameters of an energy model as a measure of such an inherent capability.
We say that the parameters of an energy model are learnable iff there exists at least one set of such parameters that renders every known RNA structure to date the min- imum free energy structure.
We derive a necessary condition for the learnability and give a dynamic programming algorithm to assess it.
Our algorithm computes the convex hull of the feature vectors of all feasible structures in the ensemble of a given input sequence.
Interestingly, that convex hull coincides with the Newton polytope of the partition function as a polynomial in energy parameters.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach toward computing the RNA Newton polytope and a systematic assessment of the inherent capabilities of an energy model.
The worst case complexity of our algorithm is exponential in the number of features.
However, dimen- sionality reduction techniques can provide approximate solutions to avoid the curse of dimensionality.
Results: We demonstrated the application of our theory to a simple energy model consisting of a weighted count of A-U, C-G and G-U base pairs.
Our results show that this simple energy model satisfies the necessary condition for more than half of the input unpseudo- knotted sequence structure pairs (55%) chosen from the RNA STRAND v2.0 database and severely violates the condition for  13%, which provide a set of hard cases that require further investi- gation.
From 1350 RNA strands, the observed 3D feature vector for 749 strands is on the surface of the computed polytope.
For 289 RNA strands, the observed feature vector is not on the boundary of the polytope but its distance from the boundary is not more than one.
A distance of one essentially means one base pair difference between the observed structure and the closest point on the boundary of the polytope, which need not be the feature vector of a structure.
For  *To whom correspondence should be addressed.
171 sequences, this distance is larger than two, and for only 11 sequences, this distance is larger than five.

Furthermore, with the advent of synthetic biology at the whole organism level (Gibson et al., 2010), high-throughput accurate RNA engineering algorithms are required for both in vivo and in vitro applications (Seeman, 2005  Seeman and Lukeman, 2005  Simmel and Dittmer, 2005  Venkataraman et al., 2007  Yin et al., 2008).
Since the dawn of RNA secondary structure prediction nearly two score years ago (Tinoco et al., 1973), the research community has proposed increasingly complex models and algorithms, hoping that refined features together with better methods to estimate their parameters would solve the problem.
Early approaches considered mere base pair counting, followed by the Turner thermodynamics model, which was a significant leap forward.
Recently, massively feature-rich models empowered by parameter estimation algo- rithms have been proposed, but they provide only modest improvements.
Despite significant progress in the last three decades, made possible by the work of Mathews et al.
(1999) on measuring RNA thermodynamic energy parameters and the work of several groups on novel algorithms (Bernhart et al., 2006  Chitsaz et al., 2009a, b  Dirks and Pierce, 2003  McCaskill, 1990  Nussinov et al., 1978  Rivas and Eddy, 1999  Waterman and Smith, 1978  Zuker and Stiegler, 1981) and machine learning approaches (Andronescu et al., 2010  Do et al., 2006  Zakov et al., 2011), the RNA structure prediction accuracy has not reached a satisfactory level yet (Rivas et al., 2012).
Why is it so  Up to now, human intuition and computational convenience have led the way.
We believe that human intuition has to be equipped with systematic methods to assess the suitability of a given energy model.
Surprisingly, there is not a single method to assess whether the parameters of an energy model are learnable.
We say that the parameters of an energy model are learnable iff there exists at least one set of such parameters that renders every known RNA structure to date, determined through radiograph or NMR, the minimum free energy structure.
Equivalently, we say that the parameters of an energy model are learnable iff 100% structure prediction accuracy can be achieved when the training and test sets are identical.
The first step toward high-accuracy structure prediction is to make sure that the  ß The Author 2013.

its parameters are learn- able.
In this work, we provide a necessary condition for the learnability and an algorithm to verify it.
The problem of learn- ability was previously studied for sequence alignment using simi- lar methods (Dewey et al., 2006).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach toward a systematic assessment of the suitability of an energy model for RNA structure prediction.
Note that a successful RNA folding algorithm needs to have the generalization power to predict unseen structures as well.
However, if an energy model is inherently incapable of predicting known structures correctly, then it does not matter if it has the generalization power.
We leave analysis of the generalization power for future work.
2 BACKGROUND  2.1 RNA secondary structure models  An RNA secondary structure model is often a context-free gram- mar together with a scoring function for either the rules, in the case of stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) (Eddy and Durbin, 1994), or the alphabet, in the case of thermodynamics models (Mathews et al., 1999).
Such scoring functions induce scoring on the entire generated language.
The word with optimal score then yields a predicted structure for the given sequence.
For the sake of brevity, we focus on thermodynamics models in this article, but it is obvious that our methods apply to other models including SCFG as well.
In our context, the scoring function is the thermodynamics free energy.
A secondary struc- ture y of a nucleic acid is decomposed into loops, a free energy is associated with every loop in y and the total free energy G for y is the sum of loop free energies (Mathews et al., 1999).
The same loop decomposition principle applies to interacting nucleic acids such that the total free energy G is still the sum of the free energies of loops and interaction components (Chitsaz et al., 2009b).
2.2 Estimation of energy parameters  Generally, RNA structure prediction algorithms are divided into probabilistic and non-probabilistic categories.
Besides machine learning approaches for the probabilistic methods, e.g.
SCFGs, which are evaluated in (Rivas et al., 2012), existing machine learning algorithms for parameter estimation in the non-prob- abilistic RNA structure prediction can be grouped into two categories:    Likelihood-based methods, where the maximum likelihood or maximum conditional likelihood principle is used to estimate the parameters of the model (e.g.
Do et al., 2006)  and    Large-margin methods, where the model parameters are estimated to maximize the margin between the score of the true structure and the second best structure.
This has been done using an online passive-aggressive training algorithm (Zakov et al., 2011) and Iterative Constraint Generation (Andronescu et al., 2007).
The likelihood-based techniques estimate the best Gibbs distri- bution, which not only assists in predicting the best secondary  RNA Newton polytope  structure but also is used in determining the thermodynamic parameters.
Besides some probabilistic methods (Rivas et al., 2012), one of the most successful methods for learning the thermodynamics of RNA has been the MCL method, as in CONTRAfold (Do et al., 2006), which maximizes the probability of RNA structures y given RNA sequences x for the training set D. That is, the conditional log likelihood of the training data (using the Boltzmann distribution) is maximized to estimate the best model parameters h  2 Rk:  X    h  :¼ arg max  LðD  hÞ ¼ max  logpðyjx, hÞ  h  h  ðx, yÞ2D pðyjx, hÞ :¼ e Gðx, y, hÞ=RT Qðx, hÞ  ð1Þ  ð2Þ  where k denotes the number of different motifs defined in the energy model, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute tempera- ture, Gðx, y, hÞ is the free energy and  X  Qðx, hÞ :¼  e Gðx, s, hÞ=RT  s2EðxÞ  ð3Þ  is the partition function (Chitsaz et al., 2009b  Dirks and Pierce, 2003  McCaskill, 1990) with EðxÞ being the ensemble of possible structures of x.
The free energy  ð4Þ is a linear function of the parameters h where cðx, sÞ 2 Zk is the features vector.
Gðx, s, hÞ :¼ cðx, sÞ, h     The best performing method for RNA STRAND v2.0 is Contextfold (Zakov et al., 2011).
However, Contextfold per- forms worse than other methods in other datasets that are struc- turally different from RNA STRAND v2.0 (Rivas et al., 2012).
Essentially, it seems that Contextfold suffers from overfitting because it uses a myriad of features in its model.
A systematic evaluation of the learnability using our algorithm in this article may help design a more concise set of features that is powerful enough to achieve high accuracy but not too powerful to suffer from overfitting.
The question that we ask before parameter estimation is  does  3 LEARNABILITY there ever exist parameters hy such that for every ðx, yÞ 2 D, y ¼ arg mins Gðx, s, hyÞ   If the answer to this question is no,  then there is no hope that one can ever achieve 100% accuracy using the given model.
The answer reveals inherent limitations of the model, which can be used to design improved models.
We provide a necessary condition for the existence of hy and  a dynamic programming algorithm to verify it through comput- ing the Newton polytope for every x in D. We will define the RNA Newton polytope below.
Not only our algorithm provides a binary answer, it also quantifies the distance from the bound- ary.
For our 3D model, this distance roughly captures the dif- ference between the number of base pairs in the observed structure and the number of base pairs in the closest point on the boundary of the polytope.
Note that the closest point on the boundary of the polytope need not be the feature vector of a structure.

The reason for naming this polytope the Newton polytope will be made clear below.
Inequality equation (9) implies that cðx, yÞ 2 @NðxÞ is on the boundary of the convex hull of the feature ensemble of x with a support hyperplane normal to hy.
Therefore, we have the following theorem.
THEOREM 1.
Let  ðx, yÞ 2 D and 0 6¼ hy 2 Rk.
Assume y minim- izes Gðx, s, hyÞ as a function of s. In that case, cðx, yÞ 2 @NðxÞ, i.e.
the fea- ture vector of ðx, yÞ is on the boundary of the Newton polytope of x.
PROOF.
To the contrary, suppose cðx, yÞ is in the interior of NðxÞ.
Therefore, there is an open ball of radius  40 centered at cðx, yÞ com- pletely contained in NðxÞ, i.e.

For ðx, yÞ 2 D, a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of hy such that y minimizes Gðx, s, hyÞ as a function of s is that cðx, yÞ lies on the boundary of NðxÞ the Newton polytope of x.  i302  ð12Þ ð13Þ  ð16Þ  ð17Þ  ð18Þ  ð19Þ  the  4.2 Relation to the Newton polytope In addition to D, the set of experimentally determined structures, we often have a repository of thermodynamic measurements, e.g.
melting curves, which can help better estimate energy parameters.
Currently, optical melting measurements are analyzed using a two-state model (Siegfried and Bevilacqua, 2009).
However, a more accurate ana- lysis of such melting experiments can be done through relating the meas- urements to the energy parameters through equations involving the partition function and its derivatives with respect to temperature (Chitsaz et al., 2009b).
We show that with a change of variables, the partition function becomes a polynomial.
Therefore, such equations become a system of polynomial equations the solving of which algebra- ically requires computation of the Newton polytope of each polynomial (Emiris, 1994  Emiris and Canny, 1995).
Recall the partition function defined in equation (3) and energy in equation (4), and conclude  X  Qðx, hÞ ¼  e  s2EðxÞ  h   cðx, sÞ, h  i=RT:  Let cðx, sÞ ¼ ðc1ðx, sÞ, .

Define new variables  Zi :¼ e hi=RT, 1   i   k  and replace them in equation (16).
We obtain the partition function  X  Qðx, ZÞ ¼  Zcðx, sÞ  s2EðxÞ  in the form of a polynomial in R½Z  where  Zcðx, sÞ  :¼  Zciðx, sÞ  i  Y  k  i¼1  is a monomial as 0   ciðx, sÞ 2 Z.
The Newton polytope of Q is defined to be the convex hull of the monomials power vectors, i.e.
Newton Qðx, ZÞ    :¼ conv cðx, sÞ j s 2 EðxÞ That is why we call NðxÞ the Newton polytope of x.
¼ NðxÞ:  ð20Þ              4.3 RNA Newton polytope algorithm We give a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the Newton polytope for a given nucleic acid sequence x. Denote the length of x by L and the ith nucleotide in x by ni.
Denote the subsequence of x from the ith to the jth nucleotide, inclusive of ends, by ni     nj.
The following lemma allows us to formulate a divide-and-conquer strategy for computing the Newton polytope, which will in turn lead to our dynamic programming algorithm.
LEMMA 1.
Let f and g be two polynomials in R½Z .
The Newton polytope of the product of f and g is the Minkowski sum of individual Newton polytopes, and the Newton polytope of the sum of f and g is the convex hull of the union of individual Newton polytopes, i.e.
ð        Þ [ Newton gð Þ  Newton fgð Newton f þ g  Þ ¼ Newton fð Þ   Newton gð Þ Þ ¼ conv Newton fð  ð21Þ ð22Þ in which   represents the Minkowski sum of two polytopes (Emiris, 1994).
This lemma allows us to use the same divide-and-conquer strategy that was used for calculating the partition function (Chitsaz et al., 2009b  Dirks and Pierce, 2003  McCaskill, 1990).
We can use the same recursions (grammar) as in the partition function algorithm but with the Minkowski sum   instead of multiplication, convex hull of union instead of summa- tion and the corresponding feature vector c instead of e hc, hi=RT.
Furthermore, because union is invariant with respect to repetition of points, the dynamic programming is allowed to be redundant, or equiva- lently the grammar is allowed to be ambiguous.
Hence, any complete   RNA structure or RNA RNA interaction prediction dynamic program- ming algorithm can be transformed into a Newton polytope algorithm by replacing the energy with the corresponding feature vector, summation with the Minkowski sum   and minimization with the convex hull of union.
As explained above, we transform any complete partition function or structure prediction dynamic programming algorithm, for single RNA, RNA RNA interaction or multiple interacting RNAs, into a Newton polytope algorithm.
For the sake of illustration, we explicitly spell below only the case of single RNA with separate A-U, C-G and G-U base pair counting energy model.
All the other cases are trivially obtained following the transformations above.
In this case, the feature vector  cðx, sÞ ¼ ðc1ðx, sÞ, c2ðx, sÞ, c3ðx, sÞÞ  is 3D: c1ðx, sÞ is the number of A-U, c2ðx, sÞ the number of C-G and c3ðx, sÞ the number of G-U base pairs in s. Our dynamic programming algorithm starts by computing the Newton polytope for all unit length subsequences, followed by all length two subsequences , .

, up to the Newton polytope for the entire sequence x.
We denote the Newton poly- tope of the subsequence ni     nj by Nði, jÞ, i.e.
Nði, jÞ :¼ Nðni     njÞ  ð23Þ  The following dynamic programming will yield the result  Nði, jÞ ¼  2 6664  8        :  conv [      Nði,  Þ   Nð  þ 1, jÞ, i       j   1     ð1, 0, 0Þ     ð0, 1, 0Þ ð0, 0, 1Þ    Nði þ 1, j   1Þ   Nði þ 1, j   1Þ   Nði þ 1, j   1Þ  if ninj ¼ AUjUA if ninj ¼ CGjGC if ninj ¼ GUjUG        3 7775  ð24Þ  with the base case Nði, iÞ ¼ ð0, 0, 0Þ .
To compare with only (AU, CG) base pair counting, we also compute the 2D Newton polygon by just projecting the 3D polytope onto the first two coordinates.
There are two different approaches for polytope representation: (i) vertex representation, which is a set of points, and (ii) half plane repre- sentation, which is a set of linear inequalities.
The former is often called V-representation and the latter H-representation.
Although they are equivalent, and there are algorithms to transform one into the other, computing Minkowski sum is more convenient with the V-representation, and convex hull of union works more efficiently with the H-representa- tion.
The choice of representation and algorithms will affect the running time.
In this article, we use the V-representation.
Owing to the complexity of the convex hull problem, the worst case complexity of our algorithm is exponential in the number of features.
4.4 Verification of the necessary condition On computation of NðxÞ and cðx, yÞ, the feature vector of the experimen- tally determined structure, it remains to verify whether cðx, yÞ 2 @NðxÞ.
Often, NðxÞ is represented by its vertices (V-representation) or its confining half planes (H-representation), two equivalent representations that can be transformed into one another.
In an H-representation, cðx, yÞ is on the boundary of NðxÞ iff there is at least one confining plane on which cðx, yÞ lies.
This is true because cðx, yÞ 2 NðxÞ anyways.
Therefore, the necessary condition can be easily checked by checking membership of cðx, yÞ in every confining plane.
Because the vertices of NðxÞ are on the integer lattice, all calculations are rational and hence can be performed exactly.
4.5 Dataset We used 1350 unpseudoknotted RNA sequence structure pairs from RNA STRAND v2.0 database as our dataset D. RNA STRAND v2.0  RNA Newton polytope  contains known RNA secondary structures of any type and organism, particularly with and without pseudoknots.
RNA STRAND v2.0 (Andronescu et al., 2008) is a convenient source of RNA sequences and structures selected from various Rfam families (Burge et al., 2013).
There are 2334 pseudoknot-free RNAs in the RNA STRAND database.
We sorted them based on their length and selected the first 1350 ones, whose lengths vary between 4 and 121 nt.
We excluded pseudoknotted structures because our current implementation is incapable of considering pseudo- knots.

To verify the  i304   RNA Newton polytope  necessary condition, i.e.
whether the experimentally determined feature vector lies on the boundary of the Newton polytope, we calculated the distance of the feature vector from the boundary of the polytope using the  p_poly_dist  MATLAB function (Yoshpe, 2006).
A zero distance corresponds to the case where the feature vector lies on the boundary, i.e.
the condition is satisfied, and a positive distance to the case where the feature vector is in the interior of the Newton polytope.
We nor- malized the distance by third root of the volume of the polytope (square root of the area in the case of a polygon).
The normalized distance quantifies how far the feature vector is from the boundary.
We parallelized our MATLAB code using MATLAB  parfor .
The length of input RNA sequences varied between 4 and  120 nt.
For the smallest ones, our program took a fraction of a second and for the longest ones it took510 min to run on a 2.5 GHz 12-Core AMD Opteron CPU.
5 RESULTS For each strand of RNA, the distance between cðx, yÞ, the real feature vector of the secondary structure and the computed convex hull, NðxÞ, is calculated using (Yoshpe, 2006).
We denote this distance by r(x) here.
The necessary condition for the learnability is satisfied if rðxÞ ¼ 0 for all x in the dataset, which shows that the observed feature vector lies on the bound- ary of NðxÞ.
Figure 1 illustrates the secondary structure of a ribosomal RNA and its 2D and 3D Newton polytopes.
This RNA is 116 nt long, and the distance between the polytope and the observed feature vector for this RNA is 2.
In the 2D (AU, CG) model, this distance is 10.
The observed feature vector has moved closer to the boundary, going from 2D to 3D, as GU pairs are accounted for in the 3D model.
Figure 2 shows a shorter HIV-1 RNA with the length of 32 nt.
The distance between the 3D polytope and the observed feature vector for this RNA is 0, while there is a distance of 2 in the 2D model.
In this case also, the observed feature vector has moved closer to the boundary, going from 2D to 3D.
Because there is no GU pair in this observed structure, the observed feature vector lies on the c3ðx, yÞ ¼ 0 face, which is on the boundary of the polytope.
Figure 3 illustrates Escherichia coli 5S ribosomal RNA, which is 121 nt long, and the distance between the feature vector and the polytope is 7 in this case.
The distance has not changed in the 3D model.
Figure 4 demonstrates the histogram of r(x) for the input dataset.
Out of 1350 strands of RNA, the observed feature vector is on the surface of the 3D Newton polytope for 749 (55%) sequences.
The distance r is not zero, but not more than one, for 289 (21%) sequences.
For 141 ( 10%) strands, this  Distance Histogram  Distance  800  700  600  500  400  300  200  100  s e c n e u q e S    f o   r e b m u N  0 0  1  2  3  4  Distance  5  6  7  8  Normalized Distance  0.15 0.3 Distance/3rd Root(Volume)  0.25  0.2  1200  1000  800  600  400  200  s e c n e u q e S    f  o   r e b m u N  0 0  0.05  0.1  p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ VolðNðxÞÞ  350  300  250  200  150  100  50  0 0  250  200  150  100  50  s e c n e u q e S    f  o    r e b m u N  s e c n e u q e S    f o   r e b m u N  2  4  6  Distance  8  10  12  14  Normalized Distance  Fig.

(Bottom) Scatter plot of the number of vertices versus strand length in the 2D model  distance is between 1 and 2, and for 171 (13%) strands, it is more than 2, and just for 11 ( 1%) sequences, this distance is above 5.
As it is clear from Figure 4, the largest r is 8 bp in the 3D model.
The second plot in Figure 4 shows the normalized distance histo- gram.
The third root of the polytope s volume is used as the normalization factor.
For the same set of strands, the observed feature vector of only 176 strands lies on the boundary of the 2D Newton polygon.
For 327 sequence, this distance is larger than 5.
As you can see in Figure 5, the maximum distance between an observed feature vector and the polygon is 14 in the 2D model.
The second plot in Figure 5 shows the normalized distance histo- gram.
The square root of the polygon s area is used as the nor- malization factor.
Figure 6 shows the histogram of the number of faces of the 3D Newton polytope  79 strands have a polytope with less than 10 faces.
The minimum number of faces is five, and 118 strands yield a polytope with more than 100 faces.
For 211 strands, the polytope has more than 10 but no more than 20 faces.
Only 47 strands have more than 150 faces.
The second plot in Figure 6 depicts the histogram of the number of vertices of the Newton polytope.
Figure 7 shows the relation between the length and number of vertices for the 2D and 3D models.
The number of vertices in 2D is not more than 15, but that number increases to about 180 in 3D.
6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  We introduced the notion of learnability of the parameters of an energy model as a measure of its inherent capability.
We derived a necessary condition for the learnability and gave a dynamic programming algorithm to assess it.
Our algorithm computes the convex hull of the feature vectors of all feasible structures in the ensemble of a given input sequence.
Also, that convex hull coin- cides with the Newton polytope of the partition function as a polynomial in transformed energy parameters.
Our theory applied to a simple energy model that counts A-U, C-G and G-U base pairs separately revealed that about half of chosen known structures could potentially be predicted using this simple energy model.
For another one-fifth, the necessary con- dition is barely violated, which suggests that augmenting this en- ergy model with more features is expected to satisfy the necessary condition for them.
The condition is severely violated for 13% of sequences, which will be the subject of future investigation.
The twilight zone ( 10%) is also interesting and requires deeper examination.
The Newton polytope lies in the core of computer algebra for solving polynomial equations.
Therefore, we envision applica- tions of our RNA Newton polytope in symbolic estimation of  i306   RNA Newton polytope  energy parameters.
Our algorithm has a worst case exponential complexity due to the computation of the convex hull.
However, we envision efficient approximation of the Newton ploytope through topology-preserving dimensionality reduction methods.
Applying our method to increasingly complex models as well as design of energy models using our analysis method will be pursued in the future.
Sufficient conditions for the learnability, and also assessing the generalization power of an energy model, remain for future work.
