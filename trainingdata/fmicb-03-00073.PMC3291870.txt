Soon after the discovery of Kaposi sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), it was
appreciated that this virus was associated with most cases of multicentric Castleman
disease (MCD) arising in patients infected with human immunodeﬁciency virus. It has sub-
sequently been recognized that KSHV–MCD is a distinct entity from other forms of MCD.
Like MCD that is unrelated to KSHV, the clinical presentation of KSHV–MCD is dominated by
systemic inﬂammatory symptoms including fevers, cachexia, and laboratory abnormalities
including cytopenias, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, and elevated C-reactive protein.
Pathologically KSHV–MCD is characterized by polyclonal, IgM-lambda restricted plasmacy-
toid cells in the intrafollicular areas of affected lymph nodes. A portion of these cells are
infected with KSHV and a sizable subset of these cells express KSHV lytic genes including
a viral homolog of interleukin-6 (vIL-6). Patients with KSHV–MCD generally have elevated
KSHV viral loads in their peripheral blood. Production of vIL-6 and induction of human (h)
IL-6 both contribute to symptoms, perhaps in combination with overproduction of IL-10
and other cytokines. Until recently, the prognosis of patients with KSHV–MCD was poor.
Recent therapeutic advances targeting KSHV-infected B cells with the anti-CD20 mono-
clonal antibody rituximab and utilizing KSHV enzymes to target KSHV-infected cells have
substantially improved patient outcomes. Recently another KSHV-associated condition,
the KSHV inﬂammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS) has been described. Its clinical mani-
festations resemble those of KSHV–MCD but lymphadenopathy is not prominent and the
pathologic nodal changes of KSHV–MCD are absent. Patients with KICS exhibit elevated
KSHV viral loads and elevation of vIL-6, homolog of human interleukin-6 and IL-10 compa-
rable to those seen in KSHV–MCD; the cellular origin of these is a matter of investigation.
KICS may contribute to the inﬂammatory symptoms seen in some patients with severe KS
or primary effusion lymphoma. Additional research is needed to better deﬁne the clinical
spectrum of KICS and its relationship to KSHV–MCD. In additional, research is needed to
better understand the pathogenesis and epidemiology of both KICS and KSHV–MCD, as
well as the optimal therapy for both of these disorders.

KAPOSI SARCOMA-ASSOCIATED HERPESVIRUS AND
ASSOCIATED DISEASES
Kaposi sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a gamma
herpesvirus that is established as the causative agent of a sev-
eral human illnesses, including KS, primary effusion lymphoma
(PEL), and, in the setting of human immunodeﬁciency virus
(HIV) infection, almost all cases of multicentric Castleman dis-
ease (MCD; Chang et al., 1994; Cesarman et al., 1995; Soulier
et al., 1995). In KS, the predominant cell type is the spindle cell,
which expresses endothelial markers, while the cell of origin in
PEL and KSHV–MCD is of B-cell lineage. KS and KSHV–MCD
are polyclonal in nature, while PEL is considered to be mon-
oclonal. Like other herpesviruses, KSHV infection can exhibits
both latent and lytic phases, distinguished by their viral gene

expression patterns (Moore and Chang, 1998; Staskus et al., 1999;
Sun et al., 1999). KSHV can establish latency in various cell types
including endothelial cells and B-lymphocytes (Monini et al.,
1999; Wu et al., 2006; Della Bella et al., 2008). Gene expression
in latent phase is extremely limited (Jenner et al., 2001), with
expressed genes primarily being directed to enhance cell survival,
inhibit apoptosis, and evade the host immune response (Moore
and Chang, 1998; Wen and Damania, 2010). Following activa-
tion of the lytic switch gene, RTA, encoded by open reading
frame (ORF) 50, the virus enters the lytic phase, wherein the full
complement of viral encoded genes is expressed and the host cel-
lular machinery is redirected to the manufacture and assembly
of progeny virions. The triggers of lytic activation in vivo remain
unclear. It is speculated that intermittent lytic cycles may play a

role in maintaining viral persistence in the host (Gregory et al.,
2009).

its pathogenesis (Oksenhendler et al., 2000; Aoki et al., 2001a;
Polizzotto et al., 2011).

The KSHV genome is notable for its molecular piracy of cel-
lular genes (Moore et al., 1996; Ganem, 2010). These appear
to promote viral survival, and there is evidence that they con-
tribute to the pathogenesis of KSHV-associated diseases through
interactions with the human cellular machinery and immune sys-
tem. These gene mimics include viral homologs of interferon
regulatory factors (IRF), ORF K9/vIRF-1, and ORF K11.5/vIRF-
2; a viral homolog of human interleukin-6 (hIL-6) called viral
IL-6 (vIL-6; encoded by ORF K2); and a constitutively active
G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) with pro-angiogenic and
immunomodulatory functions encoded by ORF74 (Aoki et al.,
2000; Jenner et al., 2001; Yarchoan, 2006). While vIL-6 is com-
monly referred to as a lytic gene, in some circumstances it may
be expressed in the absence of full lytic activation (Chatterjee
et al., 2002). KSHV also encodes at least 12 small non-coding
microRNAs (miRNAs), whose functions are still to be compre-
hensively determined (Ganem and Ziegelbauer, 2008; Umbach
and Cullen, 2010). There is evidence that these also interact with
host proteins in ways that favor viral survival and may also induce
expression of other host inﬂammatory proteins including IL-10
(Abend et al., 2010; Lei et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2010; Qin et al.,
2010).

Viral IL-6 exhibits a number of important differences from its
human counterpart. Their sequence homology is approximately
25% (Moore et al., 1996; Neipel et al., 1997). vIL-6 has a signal-
ing potency 100- to 1000-fold lower that that seen with hIL-6 in
in vitro models (Aoki et al., 2000). However, unlike hIL-6, vIL-
6 is able to signal by forming a tetrameric complex with the IL-6
receptor superfamily gp130 component, which is widely expressed
in human tissues, without requiring binding to the classical gp80
IL-6 receptor (Heinrich et al., 1998; Boulanger et al., 2004; Meads
and Medveczky, 2004; Hu and Nicholas, 2006). As a result, vIL-6
may be able to initiate signaling in a wider variety of cell types than
does hIL-6 (Osborne et al., 1999; Meads and Medveczky, 2004).
In addition, there is in vitro evidence of vIL-6 autocrine action in
lytically infected cells, though the function and signiﬁcance of this
activity is as yet uncertain (Chen et al., 2009a,b).

In the absence of HIV infection or other causes of immun-
odeﬁciency, most infection with KSHV is clinically silent, even
when intermittent lytic activation cycles occur. However, as T
cell immunity declines, KSHV-infected patients become increas-
ingly likely to develop KSHV-associated tumors, particularly KS.
It is not unusual for patients to manifest more than one KSHV-
associated tumor. Each of these tumors has also been reported in
other immunosuppressed and older individuals (Teruya-Feldstein
et al., 1998). In KS tissue, KSHV is found predominantly in latent
phase as assessed by immunohistochemical and genetic analysis
of tumor tissue, while there is limited expression of KSHV viral
genes, especially vIL-6, in PEL cells (Teruya-Feldstein et al., 1998;
Jones et al., 1999; Staskus et al., 1999; Parravicini et al., 2000).
By contrast, and unusually among herpesvirus-associated tumors,
KSHV–MCD is associated with lytically active KSHV in a substan-
tial proportion of KSHV-infected cells (Oksenhendler et al., 1996;
Staskus et al., 1999; Parravicini et al., 2000). This lytic activation,
and particularly the production of vIL-6, is thought to underlie

MULTICENTRIC CASTLEMAN DISEASE
There are several forms of Castleman disease, which historically
have been distinguished by clinical ﬁndings (based on whether
involved nodes are singular or multiple), pathologic ﬁndings, and
more recently etiology (idiopathic or KSHV-associated; Cronin
and Warnke, 2009). The idiopathic forms, as originally described,
include a hyaline vascular form (usually unicentric) and a plasma-
cytoid form (usually multicentric). The KSHV-associated form
is characteristically multicentric, with distinct pathologic features
mirroring its unique etiology, as described below (Oksenhendler
et al., 1996). Nearly all Castleman disease arising in the setting
of HIV infection is KSHV-associated MCD (KSHV–MCD), while
KSHV–MCD also rarely occurs in non-HIV infected individuals,
particularly the immunocompromised. KSHV–MCD is consid-
ered to be rare, although its incidence is not well deﬁned. By
contrast to KS, there is evidence that MCD has become more
common since the advent of combination anti-retroviral therapy
(cART; Powles et al., 2009).

KSHV-MCD is characterized by intermittent ﬂares of inﬂam-
matory symptoms, including fevers, fatigue, and cachexia, and
edema, together with lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly
(Oksenhendler et al., 1996; Stebbing et al., 2008). Gastrointestinal
and respiratory symptoms are common. Flares are often severe
and can be fatal. Common laboratory abnormalities include ane-
mia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, and
elevated inﬂammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP;
Oksenhendler et al., 2000; Oksenhendler, 2009). The clinical
course waxes and wanes, but until recently, has generally been
fatal within 2 years of diagnosis, with patients succumbing to
the severe inﬂammatory syndrome, concurrent infections, or pro-
gressing to lymphoma (Oksenhendler et al., 2000; Stebbing et al.,
2008). The differential diagnosis of fever and adenopathy, even
with other laboratory abnormalities, in the HIV infected individ-
uals is broad. As a result, KSHV–MCD may be difﬁcult to diagnose
and is often missed. Also, while there are few reports of KSHV–
MCD in Africa, there is recent evidence that it may be substantially
underdiagnosed in this region (Ayers et al., 2011).

The diagnosis of KSHV–MCD is made pathologically by a
lymph node biopsy demonstrating hypocellular germinal centers
with a vascularized core and by a proliferation of polyclonal, IgM
λ-restricted plasmacytoid cells in the interfollicular area (Oksen-
hendler et al., 1996; Du et al., 2001; Chadburn et al., 2008). A
proportion of these cells are KSHV-infected, as demonstrated by
expression of the KSHV latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA-
1), and of these a subset express KSHV lytic genes, especially vIL-6
(Du et al., 2001; Figure 1). Areas of KS spindle cell proliferation in
affected nodes are also not uncommon (Naresh et al., 2008). How-
ever, the majority of the cellular burden within affected nodes is
comprised of uninfected plasmacytoid B-lymphocytes (Chadburn
et al., 2008; Naresh et al., 2009).

As noted, the symptom complex of KSHV–MCD is asso-
ciated with inﬂammatory dysregulation attributable to KSHV
lytic activation. Both production of vIL-6 and induction of host
production of hIL-6 have separately been postulated to contribute

to symptoms, perhaps in combination with enhanced produc-
tion of human interleukin-10 (IL-10) and other human cytokines
(Oksenhendler et al., 2000; Aoki et al., 2001a,b; Bower et al.,
2009). Viral and human IL-6 over-expression in mouse models can
each produce phenotypes resembling that of KSHV–MCD (Brandt
et al., 1990; Aoki et al., 2001b). Symptomatic episodes (“ﬂares”) are
also associated with high KSHV viral loads (Oksenhendler et al.,
2000; Polizzotto et al., 2011). Histopathologic evaluation of nodes
involved by KSHV–MCD suggests that the cellular origins of vIL-6
and hIL-6 are largely distinct: involved nodes show vIL-6 produc-
tion within the periphery of affected germinal center, in the lytic
subset of the relatively small number of KSHV-infected cells. By
contrast, the larger number of KSHV-uninfected cells in the core
of affected nodes can produce hIL-6 but not vIL-6 (Chadburn
et al., 2008).

KSHV INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE SYNDROME
In addition to these well-recognized KSHV-associated diseases,
our group has recently described what appears to be a novel
inﬂammatory symptom complex associated with KSHV infec-
tion (Uldrick et al., 2010a). In six patients with HIV and KSHV
co-infection, but without any pathological evidence of MCD,
we observed an inﬂammatory syndrome resembling that seen
in MCD. These patients presented with abnormalities including

fevers, sweats, fatigue, wasting, cytopenias, hypoalbuminemia, and
hyponatremia, associated in some cases with lymphadenopathy
or effusions (Table 1). Notably, four of the six patients also
had severe KS. Each patient underwent a least one tissue biopsy
to rule out KSHV–MCD as a cause of symptoms. None had
pathologic evidence of KSHV–MCD (or KSHV-associated lym-
phoma), although abnormal KSHV-infected mononuclear cells
were sometimes detected in biopsy specimens. None developed
KSHV–MCD on follow-up, and one patient who died had no evi-
dence of KSHV–MCD or lymphoma at autopsy (Uldrick et al.,
2010a).

We hypothesized that while these symptoms did not appear to
be caused by KSHV–MCD, they might nonetheless similarly result
from KSHV lytic activation and consequent cytokine production.
On investigation, this cohort indeed exhibited KSHV viral burdens
and cytokines proﬁles similar those seen with KSHV lytic activity
in MCD ﬂares, including substantial elevation of vIL-6 and hIL-6
(Figure 2; Uldrick et al., 2010a). Patients also exhibited markedly
elevated KSHV viral loads in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
While the number of patients is small, the large differences in
the immunologic and virologic milieu in these patients compared
to KS patients without inﬂammatory symptoms was statistically
signiﬁcant (Figure 2). Our ﬁndings in this small cohort provide
evidence that patients with lytically active KSHV may manifest
systemic clinical symptoms even in the absence of the pathologi-
cal changes diagnostic of MCD. These features are distinguishable
from the chronic immune activation of HIV infection by the pres-
ence both of markedly elevated KSHV VLs in peripheral blood
and by the detection of vIL-6 in KSHV inﬂammatory cytokine
syndrome (KICS). As seen in Figure 2, neither of these features are
evident in patients with KSHV and HIV co-infection who have KS
but do not have systemic inﬂammatory symptoms. While in the
original series all patients were HIV infected, we have subsequently
observed this syndrome in patients without HIV.

Based on this original cohort, we have proposed naming this
putative clinical syndrome KICS. The assessment of this small
retrospective cohort of patients suggest that clinical manifesta-
tions of KICS are protean, and none are speciﬁc to the syndrome.
Rather, they likely reﬂect common endpoints of proinﬂammatory

KSHV–MCD and KICS

FIGURE 2 | Viral and cytokine elevations in patients with KICS,
KSHV–MCD, and KS. Statistically signiﬁcant differences in KSHV viral load,
viral, and human cytokines were seen in KICS patients compared with
controls with KS alone, at levels comparable to those seen in KSHV–MCD.
Horizontal lines indicate median value, and the dashed line indicates the lower

limit of detection. Values are log transformed; viral and human IL-6 and IL-10
are picograms per milliliter; KSHV VL is copies/106 cells. Note that several of

cytokine deregulation in the setting of KSHV lytic replication
and pathologic expression of KSHV encoded genes such as vIL-
6. These symptoms may also be observed in other inﬂamma-
tory states, and at times can be confused clinically with sepsis.
KICS is therefore a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring pathologic
exclusion of MCD; careful evaluation to exclude alternate expla-
nations for the clinical manifestations, such as serious intercurrent
infection; demonstration of systemic inﬂammation; and demon-
stration of KSHV viral activity. Based on the initial case series,
we have proposed a working case deﬁnition for KICS (Table 2),
incorporating clinical, laboratory, and radiographic manifesta-
tions together with evidence of KSHV activation and systemic
inﬂammation, and a requirement that KSHV–MCD be excluded
on pathological examination. A clinical protocol to study this syn-
drome prospectively is underway at the National Cancer Institute,

National Institutes of Health, based on this working deﬁnition
(NCT01419561).

The precise relationship of KICS to KSHV–MCD is unclear,
and it is possible that KICS is a heterogeneous condition. Patho-
logical evaluation and perhaps functional imaging with 18-[F]-
ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)
may shed additional light on this question, and perhaps assist in
identifying lymph nodes to biopsy that may reveal KSHV–MCD.
We have preliminary evidence to show that in KSHV–MCD, patho-
logically involved nodes are detectable by FDG-PET, and that PET
ﬁndings are distinct from those of suppressed HIV or intercurrent
lymphoma (Polizzotto et al., 2010). Comparison of PET ﬁndings
in KICS and KSHV–MCD may also provide a non-invasive means
to assess disease activity and shed light on syndrome pathogen-
esis, including the possible cellular sites of disease activity. It is

The working case deﬁnition of KICS requires the presence of at least two clinical manifestations drawn from at least two categories (1a, b, and c), together with each
of the criteria in 2, 3, and 4. Clinical manifestations for the working deﬁnition are drawn from the initial case series and from ﬁndings commonly seen in KSHV–MCD.

also possible that some patients with KICS may represent a pro-
drome to KSHV–MCD or an unusual or limited presentation of
KSHV–MCD, and may eventually evolve into frank KSHV–MCD.
Alternatively, certain patients may have another cellular source
apart from lymphocytes responsible for the excess vIL-6 cytokine
production, perhaps extensive KS spindle cells or KSHV-infected
monocytes or macrophages. Notably, while several patients with
KICS in the original cohort had severe KS, several other patients in
this cohort with severe KS had less severe laboratory abnormali-
ties suggestive of KICS in conjunction with detectable vIL-6 levels,
although these abnormalities were not sufﬁciently severe for the
patients to be identiﬁed as KICS based on the clinical criteria used
for the initial case series. Similarly, PEL patients can exhibit severe
inﬂammatory symptoms with disease activity, and may exhibit
elevated KSHV viral loads (Uldrick et al., 2011b). Taken together,
these observations raise the possibility that KSHV lytic activa-
tion and associated inﬂammatory clinical manifestations may be
more common than appreciated in patients with other KSHV-
associated diseases. It is possible that signiﬁcant clinical overlap
exists between KICS, KS, and PEL.

Among patients with KSHV and HIV co-infection, KICS may
be an important cause of morbidity and mortality. KICS was
associated with 50% mortality in our small series (which likely
captured relatively severe cases). We also hypothesize that KS may
be relatively refractory to therapy in patients with KICS because
the cytokine excess can help drive KS spindle cell proliferation.
In a small number of patients our group has seen with KICS and
KS that was difﬁcult to treat, strategies to reduce KSHV burden
and intercurrent inﬂammation (including rituximab with cyto-
toxic chemotherapy) appear to have led to improvements in KS.
One can thus hypothesize that KICS may in some cases be associ-
ated with the worsening of KS that can be observed after starting
cART [KS immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS)], although
KICS has not been formally studied in this setting. Notably, some

investigators report elevated hIL-6 levels in IRIS patients without
KS, though KSHV and viral cytokines have not, to our knowledge,
been assessed in relation to systemic symptoms (Stone et al., 2001).

RATIONAL THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES IN KSHV–MCD AND
KICS
There is no standard therapy for KSHV–MCD, and most arti-
cles describing therapy have consisted of case reports or very
small series. Some of the approaches that have shown activity
include interferon-alpha, surgical resection of the spleen, cytotoxic
chemotherapy (either single agents or combinations), ganciclovir,
glucocorticoids, and rituximab (Boulanger et al., 2004; Waterston
and Bower, 2004; Dispenzieri and Gertz, 2005; Neuville et al., 2005;
Bower et al., 2007; Mylona et al., 2008; Bower, 2010). Our group has
explored selective targeting of KSHV–MCD plasmablasts based on
their expression of KSHV lytic genes that phosphorylate certain
drugs (Davis et al., 2007). One KSHV lytic gene, ORF36, encodes
a phosphotransferase that activates ganciclovir to a cytotoxic
triphosphate moiety, and another, ORF21, encodes a thymidine
kinase that phosphorylates zidovudine (AZT), again to a cytotoxic
moiety (Cannon et al., 1999; Gustafson et al., 2000). Members
of our group have shown that PEL cells in which KSHV was
lytically activated produced increased amounts of triphosphate
moieties of AZT and ganciclovir and that AZT and ganciclovir
had synergistic toxicity, at doses attainable in patients, against
these PEL lines with activated KSHV (Davis et al., 2007). No
comparable cytotoxicity was seen in non-KSHV-infected Burkitt
lymphoma cell lines. Based on these in vitro results, we explored
the combination of high dose zidovudine and valganciclovir, an
oral pro-drug of ganciclovir, in 14 patients with HIV infection and
KSHV–MCD (Uldrick et al., 2011a). This regimen delivered symp-
tomatic control and normalization of correlates of lytic KSHV
activity (including KSHV viral load, vIL-6, and hIL-6) in a high
proportion of MCD patients. Responses were evaluated based on

newly established criteria (NCI–HAMB criteria) for improvement
in clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters (including hemo-
globin, platelets, CRP, albumin, and sodium), and radiographic
parameters (Uldrick et al., 2011a). Overall, 12 patients (86%)
attained major clinical responses by these criteria, with seven
patients (50%) attaining clinical complete responses, three (21%)
attaining symptom free disease, and two (14%) attaining par-
tial clinical response. In addition, seven patients (50%) attained
major biochemical responses, with three (21%) attaining a com-
plete response, four (29%) attaining a partial response. Finally, ﬁve
patients (36%) attained a major radiographic responses includ-
ing four (29%) with complete radiographic responses. Relapses
were relatively common with this regimen, and the progression-
free survival was 6 months. However, patients overall did well,
and with 43 months of median follow-up, the overall survival
was 86%.

Several recent studies have reported that KSHV–MCD can
respond to therapy with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rit-
uximab (Corbellino et al., 2001; Marcelin et al., 2003; Ocio et al.,
2005; Bower et al., 2007). It is postulated that in this setting, it acts
by targeting the B-lymphocyte KSHV reservoirs, though it should
be noted that the level of expression (weak or absent) of CD20
on lytic KSHV-infected B-lymphocytes themselves is contentious.
Alternatively, it may target IL-6 production by other B cells that
are stimulated by the KSHV-infected plasmablasts. However, dif-
ferent investigators have reported variable results with this agent,
and two studies noted that its use was associated with a wors-
ening of KS (Neuville et al., 2005; Bower et al., 2007). Because
of this concern, and because many patients with MCD either
have KS or are at risk of KS, we have explored the combination
of rituximab and liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) in KSHV–MCD
(R/Dox). Liposomal doxorubicin has a high afﬁnity for the path-
ogenic spindle cell in KS lesions, and, when available, is currently
the standard of care for ﬁrst line therapy of KS (Northfelt et al.,
1998; Cianfrocca et al., 2010). It was also possible that it could
help target the KSHV-infected MCD plasmablasts. In an ongo-
ing study, we have treated 12 patients with this R/Dox regimen
(Uldrick et al., 2010b). R/Dox was highly effective even in heav-
ily pretreated patients. All achieved a clinical CR by NCI–HAMB
criteria (after median two cycles therapy, range 1–5); nine (75)
achieved a biochemical CR, one (8%) biochemical PR, and two
(17%) biochemical SD; while best radiographic response (nodes
and spleen) was CR in six (50%) and PR in six (50%). Toxic-
ity was not marked, comprising predominantly infusion reactions
and neutropenia.

Until recently, the expected survival of most patients with
KSHV–MCD was 2 years or less (Oksenhendler et al., 2000). With
the recent advances in therapy, along with the use of highly active
anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) for those patients with HIV-
associated KSHV–MCD, the overall prognosis of patients with
KSHV–MCD has improved markedly, and a number of patients
can now attain long remissions. Nonetheless, patients with ﬂares
of KSHV–MCD can rapidly become critically ill, with a clinical
presentation similar to patients with sepsis, and may require care-
ful monitoring, sometimes in an intensive care unit, during the
initial treatment. Our experience is that some patients may ben-
eﬁt from short-term glucocorticoids during initial KSHV–MCD

treatment, although patients should be probably weaned as soon
as possible as glucocorticoids may mask intercurrent infections
and can exacerbate KS (Gill et al., 1989). It should be noted, how-
ever, that there is no standard therapy for KSHV–MCD and it
may be worthwhile to consider a variety of approaches, depend-
ing on disease severity and other parameters. Our group has
been exploring the use of consolidation therapy after patients
achieve remissions with several months of either interferon-alpha
or high dose zidovudine with valganciclovir. Additional stud-
ies will be needed to explore new therapies, to establish the
best therapy for KSHV–MCD, and perhaps through a combina-
tion of treatments, to establish the best way to optimize ther-
apy for different patients with the goal of durable long-term
remission.

Because of the small number of patients with KSHV–MCD,
there is little commercial interest in developing drugs speciﬁcally
for this disease, and it is unlikely that a therapeutic antibody to
vIL-6 will be developed in the near future. However, an antibody
to the IL-6 receptor is in clinical use for rheumatoid arthri-
tis, while a different antibody against IL-6 is being evaluated in
the setting of MCD not associated with KSHV. Because hIL-6 is
markedly elevated and believed to contribute to disease patho-
genesis in KSHV–MCD, antibodies targeting IL-6 signaling may
have activity, and we are currently conducting a clinical study
of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody in patients with
symptomatic KSHV–MCD (NCT01441063).

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus inﬂammatory cytokine
syndrome is a newly described syndrome, and there is little clinical
experience to guide therapy. In those cases where KICS accom-
panies KS or PEL, it is reasonable to hypothesize that treatment
of the underlying tumor may help reduce the KSHV-associated
cytokines. However, it should be noted that in the original series
describing this syndrome KS was often quite difﬁcult to treat, per-
haps because of stimulation by the IL-6 or other cytokines. It
may be worthwhile to consider treatment approaches to KICS
similar to those used for KSHV–MCD. These may include, for
example, antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir with activity against
KSHV, the use of high doses of zidovudine or ganciclovir that
can be activated by KSHV to toxic moieties as described above,
the use of rituximab to kill B cells that may harbor KSHV or
be producing cytokines, or the use of liposomal doxorubicin
to kill KS spindle cells. In the original series of six patients of
KICS, one patient received high dose zidovudine and valganci-
clovir, one patient received valganciclovir alone, and two received
liposomal doxorubicin alone (Uldrick et al., 2010a). The patient
who received zidovudine/valganciclovir demonstrated an initial
improvement in laboratory parameters, though his clinical course
was later complicated signiﬁcantly by intercurrent illness, while
one patient who received valganciclovir monotherapy had a tran-
sient clinical response. The two patients who received liposomal
doxorubicin (both with KS requiring therapy) also had transient
clinical responses.

SUMMARY AND FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
Soon after the discovery of KSHV in 1994, it became apparent
that KSHV-associated PEL and KSHV–MCD were separate dis-
ease entities. Since that time, we have learned much about the

KSHV–MCD and KICS

pathogenesis of these diseases, and for KSHV–MCD in partic-
ular, therapeutic advances have led to substantial improvement
in survival. At the same time, many questions remain concerning
KSHV–MCD and its relationship to other KSHV-induced diseases.
More recently, KICS has been described as a new syndrome caused
by KSHV; but there is much to be learned about this entity. What
cells are primarily responsible for the cytokine overproduction in
KICS, and what pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for
its overproduction? What is the spectrum of disease, and what is its
incidence and prevalence in different populations? How is it best
managed? It is not unreasonable to hope that answers to many of
these questions will be forthcoming in the next decade and that
this research will help lead to improved tools to diagnose and treat
these entities.
