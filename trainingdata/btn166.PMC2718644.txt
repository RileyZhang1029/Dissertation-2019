This knowledge for engineering thermostable would be particularly relevant enzymes.
this issue has been serendipitously addressed.
It would be therefore convenient providing a computational method that predicts when a given protein mutant is more thermostable than its corresponding wild-type.
Results: We present a new method based on support vector machines that is able to predict whether a set of mutations (including insertion and deletions) can enhance the thermostability of a given protein sequence.
When trained and tested on a redundancy- reduced dataset, our predictor achieves 88% accuracy and a correlation coefﬁcient equal to 0.75.
Our predictor also correctly classiﬁes 12 out of 14 experimentally characterized protein mutants with enhanced thermostability.
Finally, it correctly detects all the 11  C. mutated proteins whose increase in stability temperature is  10 Availability: The dataset and the list of protein clusters adopted for the web site http://lipid.biocomp.unibo.it/ ludovica/thermo-meso-MUT.

In this respect, it is of great relevance developing a tool that can score protein sequences in order to screen thermostable mutants among a plethora of alternative mutated sequences (Hoppe and Shomburg, 2005).
The accumulation of genomic data, comprising thermophilic organisms, allows for a comprehensive investigation of nucleotidic and amino acidic sequences with the aim of discovering universal determinants of thermophilic life.
Many studies have attempted to correlate thermostability to both the genome and proteome compositions.
At the DNA level, differences in the codon usage between thermophilic and mesophilic organisms have been described (Lobry and Chessel, 2003  Lobry and Necsulea, 2006  Lynn et al., 2002  Singer and Hickey, 2002  Takami et al., 2004).
Recently, a codon frequency index could highlight robust determinants of thermostability capable of discriminating thermophilic from mesophilic genomes (Montanucci et al., 2007).
When residue composition in proteomes and/or protein sequences and structures were analyzed, the increased frequency in charged residues and ion pairs was recognized as the most remarkable feature of thermostable proteins (Farias and Bonato, 2003  Kreil and Ouzounis, 2001  Shure and Claverie, 2003  Szilágyi and Závodsky,    To whom correspondence should be addressed.
2000  Zhang and Fang, 2006a).
However, many other compositional features may inﬂuence protein thermostability (see Zhou et al., 2008, for a recent review, and references therein) and molecular determinants of thermal resistance at the protein level still remain elusive.
Recently, the fraction of a set of protein residues (I, V, Y, W, R, E, L) in the proteome was correlated with the optimal growth temperature of the correspondent organism (Zeldovich et al., 2007).
In this article, we address the problem of screening mutations that affect protein thermostability and develop a novel method able to sort out thermostable protein variants at the sequence level.
As discussed above, several methods have been described for discriminating among thermophilic and mesophilic proteins.
In the present work, our approach is different in that we aim at predicting whether a set of mutations (including deletions and insertions) can enhance the thermostability of a given protein.
For this reason, and differently from previous implementations (Zhang and Fang, 2006b) we trained a SVM method on the compositional difference computed for 2328 pairs of mesophilic and thermophilic proteins that share high pairwise sequence identity ( 70%).
2 METHODS 2.1 Training dataset Our training/testing dataset consists of 2328 pairs of protein sequences with the property that one member belongs to a thermophilic microbial organism and the other to a mesophilic one.
Since we are interested in detecting small differences in composition, we considered only protein pairs sharing a sequence identity  70%.
The corresponding pairwise alignment coverage is  80% for the vast majority of the cases ( 90%).
This dataset was derived from an extensive all-against-all BLAST search among the proteomes of 112 prokaryotes (12 of which are thermophilic) belonging to different genera, comprising Archaea and Bacteria.
From the outputs of the BLAST runs only aligned sequence pairs comprising a mesophilic and a thermophilic protein were selected.
Only protein pairs sharing at least 70% of sequence identity were retained.
The ﬁnal number of pairs is 2328, including 378 thermophilic and 1015 mesophilic proteins.
2.2 Deﬁnition of training and testing sets One of the major problems in developing and evaluating predictors is avoiding the similarity between training and testing sets  usually random splitting is not a correct procedure (Appendix 1).
For this reason we clustered proteins using a very conservative method.
We considered protein sequences as graph nodes.
Two nodes are linked by an edge if the local identity between the two corresponding sequences is  30%.
The graph is then a forest and the connected components deﬁne our clusters.
In this way, a cluster may contain proteins that by themselves do not share a sequence identity  30% but that are connected through a path of similar proteins.
This procedure grouped the 1393 protein sequences of the dataset into 184 non-overlapping clusters, containing the 2328 pairs of interest.
Also, each cluster contains proteins that are  30% identical to those of all the other clusters.

[20:27 18/6/03 Bioinformatics-btn166.tex]  Page: i190  i190 i195   Predicting protein thermostability changes  Although apparently too restrictive, this clustering procedure is safer for deﬁning training and testing sets.
We then used a  leave-one-cluster-out  training procedure by predicting all the proteins of one cluster with the model trained on the remainder of the data set.
In order to prove the necessity for a similarity-clustered validation scheme, we generated also a random splitting of the data set and we trained and tested the method accordingly.
From Table A1 of Appendix 1, it is evident that when random splitting is adopted, the SVM performance increases due to the higher level of homology between the training and testing sequences.
2.3 A test set of experimentally investigated  protein mutations  To validate our method with real-world applications, we collected an experimental dataset derived from the literature.
This set consists of mesophilic proteins that have been experimentally mutated resulting in proteins that show an increased optimal functional temperature (or melting temperature Tm).
This experimental set consists of 14 mutants derived from 10 different wild-type proteins (for details, see Table 1).
Among the data reported in the literature we did not consider examples that: (i) do not specify the optimal (nor the melting) temperature increment  (ii) describe proteins thermally stabilized by means of chemical post-translational modiﬁcations instead of residue mutations (such as Annaluru et al., 2007  Siddiqui and Cavicchioli, 2005  Li et al., 2007  Minagawa et al., 2007  Ruller et al., 2007  Salazar et al., 2003  Stephens et al., 2007).
2.4 Support vector machines Two support vector machines trained with linear kernel functions, using the libsvm package (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/  cjlin/libsvm).
They differ in the input encoding adopted.
The ﬁrst SVM  (SVMs) were  (L20) takes as input 20-valued vectors containing the difference of the residue composition in each pair of the dataset.
The second SVM (L400) takes as input 400-valued vectors containing the difference of the dipeptide composition in each pair of the dataset.
For each encoding type (L20 and L400) and for each protein pair in the data set, two different input vector sets were derived: a vector set encoding the composition (residue or dipeptide) difference between the thermophilic sequence and the mesophilic one (positive set), and a vector set encoding the composition (residue or dipeptide) difference between the mesophilic sequence and the thermophilic one (negative set).
By this a total of 4656 input vectors were deﬁned.
This encoding procedure ensures balancing of the positive and negative examples.
For each trained SVM we evaluated the performance using different values for the C parameter in the range of 0.1 100 000 (see the libsvm package).
The linear kernel SVM showed a high degree of robustness and the accuracy was not signiﬁcantly affected by a speciﬁc value of the C parameter.
The results presented below are computed using values for the C parameter equal to 10 000 and 1000 for L20 and L400, respectively.
Finally, a combined SVM was derived by taking the average values of the  probabilities given by L20 and L400.
2.5 Evaluating the predictor performances The evaluation of the performance of the two-class classiﬁers was determined using the following statistical indexes.
The two classes are indicated as positive (+: increased thermostability) and negative ( : decreased thermostability).
The overall accuracy of the classiﬁer is deﬁned as:  Accuracy= P N  (1)  Table 1.

It ranges from 0 to 9.
3 RESULTS 3.1 Scoring the SVM predictors The scoring indexes of the different methods were evaluated with the  leave-one-cluster-out  procedure and are reported in Table 2.
It is evident that both SVM L20 and SVM L400 perform quite well and that accuracies are almost indistinguishable in spite of the fact that L400 has far more detailed input to work with.
This indicates that the most relevant information is contained in the composition difference of two highly homologous thermophilic and mesophilic proteins ( 70%) and that more detailed information of the difference in dipeptide composition does not signiﬁcantly increase the performance.
However, the two predictors are able to extract slightly different features as indicated by the ﬁnding that the combined SVM predictor outperforms the single L20 and L400, reaching an accuracy of 88% and a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.75.
The scoring improvement of the combination of two different methods is not unexpected since it is theoretically founded when they capture different features (Sollich and Krogh, 1996).

We should also consider that  the predictions are very well balanced, reaching the same sensitivity and speciﬁcity values for the two classes.
3.2 Robustness of the performance The SVM performance can be affected by the encoding procedure given the different protein identity values (70 92%) and different protein lengths (35 1512 residues) in the dataset of protein pairs.
In Figures 2 and 3, we show the accuracy of the combined SVM as a function of protein sequence identity (Fig.
2) and length (Fig.
3) of the pairs, respectively.
It is evident that the performance is quite independent of both the identity value and protein length of the pair.
An important issue when implementing and testing a predictive method is the possibility to compute a reliability score of the  Fig.

In particular, since our kernel is linear, we easily obtained the hyper-plane vector W used by SVM for classiﬁcation (Burges, 1998).
The components of the vector normal to the discriminative hyper-plane can be computed as  (cid:1)  (cid:2)=(cid:7)  W  j  (cid:1)  (cid:2)  αiXi  j  (9)  i  where j runs from 1 to 20 and i runs over all the SVM support vectors  the αi are the positive and negative Lagrange multipliers and the Xi are the support vectors, respectively.
In practice, given our choice of input vectors, the positive components of W imply a thermophilic propensity while the negative ones indicate a mesophilic character.
The 20 components (one for each residue) of the W hyper-plane vector are plotted in Figure 5.
These components can be contrasted with the average residue composition difference among thermophilic and mesophilic protein pairs as computed on the whole dataset (Figure 5, line and dots).
It can be noticed that although the majority of the residues have the same sign in the two types of plots, the relevance of the single components is different.
The SVM selection of the best hyper-plane induces a different and weighted choice of the components with respect to a simple statistical classiﬁer (as highlighted in Figure 5).
In particular, we can observe that residues that have been previously identiﬁed as robust determinants of thermostability (Montanucci et al., 2007, and references therein) are also highlighted by the SVM method.
These are: (i) the increased abundance of glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K) and (ii) the decreased abundance of glutamine (Q) in thermostable chains.
Besides glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K), the combined SVM classiﬁer also highlights other residues as peculiar of a thermophilic character : alanine (A), isoleucine (I), leucine (L), methionine (M), proline (P), valine (V), tryptophan (W), tyrosine (Y), arginine (R) and histidine (H).
In turn, the remaining residues (C, F, G, N, Q, S, T, D) are highlighted as indicative of a mesophilic character.
It should be stressed, however, that none of these components alone is statistically signiﬁcant to infer thermostability versus mesophilicity.
Indeed, the distribution of the SVM components of the hyperplane vector is different from that of the simple average composition difference between thermophilic and mesophilic sequences in the data set (Figure 5, line and dots).
The most unexpectedly relevant component highlighted by SVM is the tryptophan difference.
The relative low abundance of tryptophan in protein sequences may have hampered this ﬁnding by previously  i193  Fig.

prediction.
This helps in scoring the performance of the method  furthermore, it can also be used to sort out the set of mutations that are more likely to increase protein thermostability in a rational computer-aided protein design.
In this respect, we tested the behavior of our method by computing its accuracy as function of the reliability measure [see Section 2, Equation (8)].
From the data shown in Figure 4 it can be concluded that for about half of the dataset the method accuracy is  95%.
3.3 A blind test on experimentally validated data In order to validate our methods on a real-world application we further tested them on an experimentally veriﬁed dataset.
For  sake of precision we checked if  the sequences of the experimental set were included in the training set.
For this reason, the 10 wild-type sequences of the experimental set were aligned with the BLAST program against all the sequences of the training set.
In nine cases, BLAST gave no hits.
Only the Bacillus subtilis CSP (BsCSP) retrieved BLAST hits with nine (seven of which mesophilic and two thermophilic) proteins in the training set.
Since these proteins were all included in a unique cluster, the predictions  [20:27 18/6/03 Bioinformatics-btn166.tex]  Page: i193  i190 i195   L.Montanucci et al.

mesophilic sequences was exploited.
The problem was also tackled by means of SVM and others machine learning approaches (Zhang and Fang, 2006b).
In this article, we address a different issue since we try to derive automatic rules to predict when a set of mutations (including deletions and insertions) can enhance protein thermostability and this is novel.
For this reason, a direct comparison with previous works is not possible, given the different inputs and goals.
To our purpose, we explicitly sorted out the subset of protein sequences among thermophilic and mesophilic organisms that share a high degree of similarity and this was adopted for training/testing with a similarity-clustered procedure.
A careful analysis of the support vectors of our method highlights that residues contributing the most to protein thermostability in the protein set are the same derived by previous approaches on different protein sets, corroborating our observations.
Finally, our methods are tested on experimentally determined and never-seen-before protein mutants with enhanced thermostability.
The results indicate that our best combined SVM predictor correctly classiﬁes 12 mutated proteins out of 14.
Furthermore, it correctly detects all the 11 mutated proteins that are endowed by an increase of the melting/optimal functional temperature, as experimentally   characterized, of  10  C (Table 3).

However, this feature is in agreement with more recent data indicating that a fraction of a set of protein residues (I, V, Y, W, R, E, L), including tryptophan, in the proteome is correlated with the optimal growth temperature of the correspondent organism (Zeldovich et al., 2007).
4 CONCLUSIONS Several papers addressed so far the problem of characterizing determinants of thermostability.
This is possible at the genome and at the proteome level, provided that determinants are statistically robust enough (Montanucci et al., 2007  Zeldovich et al., 2007, references therein).
Other works have also attempted to discriminate whether a given sequence might belong to a thermophilic or a mesophilic organism (Zhou et al., 2008, for a recent review, and references therein).
To perform this task, the information derived from entire genomes, proteomes or sets of thermophilic and  i194  [20:27 18/6/03 Bioinformatics-btn166.tex]  Page: i194  i190 i195   REFERENCES al.

APPENDIX 1 A.1 Results on a random splitting of training and  testing sets  A three-fold cross validation was carried out using random splitting of the 4656 examples in the training set.
The examples in the dataset were randomly split into three sets.
The training/testing splitting was therefore carried out regardless of the redundancy and sequence similarity among the considered sequences.
At each cross-validation run, 3104 examples were used for training and 1552 for the test.
The performances of the obtained classiﬁer are shown in Table A1.
When these results are compared to those shown in Table 1, it is evident that SVM scoring is enhanced when redundancy among the training and testing set is retained.
Table A1.

L400 is trained with the difference in dipeptide composition of the sequences.
Symbols + and   indicate increased and decreased thermostability classes, respectively.
