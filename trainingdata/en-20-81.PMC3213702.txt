Epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation plays essential roles in many aspects of cellular function 
and development of animals. There is an increasing amounts of evidence for dynamic changes in the histone acetylation of specific 
gene segments, but little attempt was made to examine global pattern changes in the histone acetylation in developing nervous 
system. In this study, we found that acetylated histone H3 and H4 immunoreactivities were relatively weak in neuroepithelial cells in 
the ventricular zone of developing rat cerebral cortex or chick spinal cord, compared to the immature young neurons in the cortical 
plate of a rat embryo or lateral motor column in chick spinal cord. On the other hand, adult neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus 
(DG) of rat hippocampal formation did not exhibit such diminished histone acetylation, compared to neuroblasts and mature DG 
neurons. These results suggest that the level of histone acetylation is highly dynamic and tightly linked to the neuronal types and the 
differentiation stages.

INTRODUCTION

Many biological processes are not only determined by DNA code 
itself, but also regulated by activity-related chromosomal re mo deling 
(Clapier and Cairns, 2009). Since acetylation of histone modifies the 
basicity of histone protein which affects histone-DNA association, 
histone acetylation is essential event for the epigenetic control of 
gene expression (Allfrey et al., 1964; Hebbes et al., 1988; Riccio, 
2010). The amount of histone acetylation is controlled by histone 
acetyltranferases (HATs) (Brownell et al., 1996) and histone de-
ace ty lases (HDACs) (Ruiz-Carrillo et al., 1975; Annunziato and 
Seale, 1983). During the development, changes in the histone ace-
ty lation greatly affect the differentiation of stem cells (Lee et al.,

2004), neuronal maturation (Hsieh et al., 2004), and programmed 
cell death (Pelzel et al., 2010) via modulation of specific gene ex-
pre ssions which are responsible for these biological processes. It is 
belie ved that gene transcription machineries recruit histone mo di-
fication enzymes into their transcriptome complex, and in this way 
specific gene transcription-mediated biological processes would be 
promoted. For instance, histone acetylation level declines during 
the differentiation of embryonic stem cells, which affects the gene 
transcription of stemness genes, such as Oct4 and Brachyury (Lee 
et al., 2004). Therefore, treatments of HDAC inhibitors, such as 
tri cho statin A (TSA) and valproic acid (VPA), or deficiency of 
HDAC greatly affect many aspects of brain function, including di-
fferentiation of neurons and oligodendrocytes (Marin-Husstege et 
al., 2002; Hsieh et al., 2004), neuronal apoptosis (Pelzel et al., 2010), 
motor innervation (Mejat et al., 2005), and memory consolidation 
(Korzus et al., 2004). 
While there have been extensive investigations of the histone 
acetylation patterns of specific gene promoter regions, little

attempt was made to explore global changes in the histone 
acetylation during the normal embryonic development. In this 
study, we found that histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels were 
stronger in the early differentiating neurons in the rat cortex and 
chick spinal cord, comparing to the proliferating neuroepithelial 
cells in the ventricular zone. These results suggest that transient 
enhancement of histone acetylation may be an important event 
for neuronal differentiation. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals
Time-pregnant C57Bl/6 mice were obtained from Orient Co. (Korea), 
and fertilized eggs were obtained from Pulmuone (Korea). Eggs 
were incubated in humidified incubator at 38oC for 3 days. Stage of 
chick embryo was identified according to the Hamilton-Ham bur-
ger’s criteria (Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992). All experiments 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines of Korea 
University, and with the approval of the Animal Care and Use Co-
mmi ttee of Korea University. 

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical analyses were performed as previously 
re ported (Sun et al., 2003). Briefly, brain or trunk tissues were iso la-
ted from embryos and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. 
Tissues were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, sectioned (20 µm) 
and attached on a gelatin-coated slide glass. Acetylated Histone 

H3 (Upstate, #06- 599, 1 : 500) and H4 (Upstate, #06-866, 1 : 1,000) 
antibodies were applied overnight. After several washes with PBS, 
secondary antibodies were applied for 30 minutes. Subsequently, 
sections were washed, counter-stained with Hechest33342, moun-
ted and observed with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss LSM510, 
Goettingen, Germany). 

RESULTS 

Acetylation of histone H3 and H4 in developing rat cerebral 
cortex
Embryonic rat cerebral cortex (E17) was immunolabeled with anti-
acetylated histone H3 or H4 antibodies (Fig. 1). Interestingly, both 
acetylated histone H3 and H4 immunoreactivities were strong in 
the cortical plate (CP) where post-mitotic neurons localize, com-
pared to the ventricular zone (VZ) and intermediate zone (IZ) 
enriched for mitotic/migrating neuroblasts. The concentration of 
histone proteins was proportional to the total DNA density, which 
may be affected by the size of nuclei. Therefore, we counterstained 
the nuclei DNA by Hoechst33342, and the relative densities of 
ace tylated histones and DNA were measured. This analysis further 
confirmed the preferential histone acetylation in the CP. 

Acetylation of histone H3 and H4 in developing chick 
spinal cord
To determine whether similar difference in histone acetylation 
levels in developing nervous system in other species appear, we 
also examined the developing chick (E7) spinal cord (Fig. 2). 
Similar to the rat cerebral cortex, the level of histone acetylations 
were strong in the lateral motor column (LMC) where post-
mito tic motor neurons localize, whereas histone acetylation

were relatively weak in the periventricular regions enriched for 
proliferating neuroepithelial cells. Another important aspect 
of histone acetylation pattern is the heterogeneity within the 
same population. For instance, large magnification images of 
LMC clearly show that the intensities of acetylated histones were 
different among motor neurons.

Acetylation of histone H3 and H4 in in adult mouse dentate 
gyrus
These results suggest that histone acetylation is closely associated 
with the mitosis and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor 
cells. Neural stem cells remain in the specific areas of adult 
brain, and they continue to produce neurons. Therefore, we next 
examined whether adult neural stem cells and their progenitors 
also showed different levels of histone H3 acetylation (Fig. 3). 
To identify different cell types, three specific markers were used; 
glial fibrary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrocytes and 
neural stem cells, doublecortin (DCX), a marker for neuroblasts, 
and neuronal nuclei (NeuN), a marker for differentiated neurons. 
Although a considerable heterogeneity of histone H3 acetylation 
levels was observed among the same cell populations, there was no 
significant difference among cell types.

for neural stem cells (GFAP, B), early neuroblasts (DCX, E), and mature 
neurons (NeuN, H) were co-labeled with acetylated histone H3 (A, D, G). 
Nuclei were counter- stained in blue with Hoechst33342. Merged images 
were shown in C, F, and I. Arrowheads in A~F indicate double-labeled 
cells, and arrows in G~I indicate NeuN-negative nuclei in the subgranular 
zone.

Histone Acetylation in CNS Development

DISCUSSION

Increased acetylation of histones may promote the overall gene 
transcription efficiency. In this study, we found that developing 
neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex and chick spinal cord 
exhibit considerably high level of histone H3 and H4 acetylation, 
compared to the proliferating stem/progenitor populations. The 
level of histone acetylation was reported to increase during the 
postnatal development of rat brain (Serra et al., 1986), consistent 
with our current observation. Although there was little attempt 
to compare histone acetylation or RNA synthesis rates between 
stem cells and progenitor neurons, neurons appear to have higher 
histone acetylation level than glial cells (Hsieh et al., 2004; Shen 
et al., 2005; Humphrey et al., 2008). Considering that the size of 
neurons greatly expands during the differentiation, it appears that 
neurons have high demands for synthesis of many different RNA 
species during neuronal differentiation. However, it is noted that 
histone acetylation does not directly indicate the rate of RNA 
synthesis., Histone acetylation do not control the RNA polymerase 
activity, but it allows RNA polymerases to bind to the DNA. In 
this respect, increased histone acetylation may be linked to other 
biological processes. 
In contrast to our in vivo data, it has been reported that cultured 
neural stem cells in vitro exhibit high level of global histone 
acetylation compared to their progenitor neurons or glial cells 
(Hsieh et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2005; Humphrey et al., 2008). 
Although it is unclear why these in vitro results are opposite 
to our current in vivo observations, it is important to note that 
epigenetic modification mainly depends on the extracellular 
signals, rather than cell autonomous events (Turner, 2009; Riccio, 
2010). In this respect, it is no wonder that in vitro situation and in 
vivo environment resulted in different histone acetylation profiles. 
Considering that histone acetylation allows the “active” status of 
stem cells, and thus many stemness gene promoter regions are less 
acetylated, it does not mean that the global histone acetylation 
level should be high in less differentiated stem/progenitor cells. 
Another important aspects about global histone acetylation 
levels identified in this study, is the heterogeneity among the 
same cell population. For instance, we found that only a subset of 
LMC chick motoneurons exhibited very strong level of histone 
acetylation. We failed to correlate the levels with known MN 
subtypes (data not shown), suggesting that these are differences 
among the same type of cells. This heterogeneity may be caused 
by highly dynamic nature of histone acetylation. In fact, histone 
acetylation is mainly regulated by two enzyme systems, histone 
acetyltransferases (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDAC) 
(Riccio, 2010). Since these enzyme activities are dynamically

regulated by multiple mechanisms, it is believed that the level of 
histone acetylation in cells are flexible and modulated by multiple 
factors, which may produce the diversity of histone acetylation 
even in the same population of cells. 
In contrast to the developmental nervous system, we failed to 
detect any significant difference in the global histone acetylation 
levels among neural stem cells, neuroblasts, and mature neurons in 
the adult dentate gyrus. Compared to the embryonic development, 
neural stem cells and their progenitor neurons are similar in size 
and space, thus they may experience less dramatic changes in cell-
autonomous gene transcription and extracellular environment. 
Additional studies would clarify how these differences occur, and 
the mechanism/significance underlying it.
