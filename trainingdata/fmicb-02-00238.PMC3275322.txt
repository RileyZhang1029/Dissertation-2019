Wildlife may facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance (AR) between human-dominated
habitats and the surrounding environment. Here, we use functional metagenomics to sur-
vey the diversity and genomic context of AR genes in gulls. Using this approach, we found
a variety of AR genes not previously detected in gulls and wildlife, including class A and
C β-lactamases as well as six tetracycline resistance gene types. An analysis of the ﬂank-
ing sequences indicates that most of these genes are present in Enterobacteriaceae and
various Gram-positive bacteria. In addition to ﬁnding known gene types, we detected 31
previously undescribed AR genes. These undescribed genes include one most similar to
an uncharacterized gene in Verrucomicrobium and another to a putative DNA repair protein
in Lactobacillus. Overall, the study more than doubled the number of clinically relevant
AR gene types known to be carried by gulls or by wildlife in general. Together with the
propensity of gulls to visit human-dominated habitats, this high diversity of AR gene types
suggests that gulls could facilitate the spread of AR.

INTRODUCTION
The vast majority of research on emerging antibiotic resistance
(AR) has focused on AR in clinical settings. However, there is grow-
ing recognition that resistance acquired outside of hospital settings
(community-acquired infections) is a serious and growing threat
(Pitout et al., 2005). Antibiotics are likely important for bacterial
interactions in natural communities as resistance genes originated
in environmental bacteria long before the antibiotic era (Aminov
and Mackie, 2007; Martinez, 2008; Davies and Davies, 2010). The
collection of all resistance genes and their precursors in patho-
genic and non-pathogenic microorganisms has been termed the
antibiotic “resistome” (Wright, 2007).

Bacteria can readily exchange DNA via lateral transfer of mobile
genetic elements (e.g., plasmids or transposons). Thus, AR genes
from non-pathogenic environmental microorganisms have the
potential to be transferred to pathogens infecting humans, espe-
cially when use of antibiotics imposes heavy selective pressure.
Indeed, as a result of widespread antibiotic use in medicine and
agriculture, multidrug resistant bacteria and resistance genes have
been detected in many environments (e.g., Sayah et al., 2005;
Seyfried et al., 2010). Antibiotics and AR bacteria originating from
human-made AR“reservoirs”may be released into nearby ground-
water, streams, rivers, and estuaries (Li et al., 2009; Martinez, 2009),
potentially leading to emergence of novel mechanisms of resis-
tance in pathogenic organisms. However, discovery of new AR
mechanisms is limited because most studies focus on culturable
bacteria and known genes detected via PCR. This approach has
resulted in a heavily biased and incomplete understanding of the
broader environmental resistome.

Wildlife may facilitate exchange of AR bacteria and genes
between human-made and natural environments. AR bacteria
and, more recently,AR genes have been detected in a variety of wild
birds and mammals (e.g., Mallon et al., 2002; Literak et al., 2009;
Marrow et al., 2009). Many species of wildlife visit human-made
areas such as farms and sewage lagoons where they may acquire AR
(Osterblad et al., 2001; Blanco et al., 2009). Further, some studies
have discovered high abundances of AR bacteria in wildlife with
little or no apparent exposure to anthropogenic sources (Williams
et al., 2011).

Gulls may be a particularly important carrier of AR because
of their close association with humans. During the past several
decades, gull populations have increased worldwide due in large
part to burgeoning human populations along coasts and the asso-
ciated increase in availability of human-derived foods (Duhem
et al., 2008; Schwemmer et al., 2008). Gulls carry a diverse array
of potentially pathogenic bacteria including Salmonella spp. (Skov
et al., 2008), Campylobacter spp. (Waldenstrom et al., 2007), Liste-
ria spp. (Fenlon, 1985), and vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia
coli O157 (Wallace et al., 1997), which they likely acquire by feeding
and loaﬁng at sewage lagoons, garbage dumps, and farms (Ben-
skin et al., 2009). Moreover, several recent studies have detected
clinically relevant AR bacteria (Cizek et al., 2007; Rose et al., 2009)
and AR genes (e.g., Dolejska et al., 2007; Bonnedahl et al., 2010)
in gull feces.

Here, we use functional metagenomics to characterize the diver-
sity of the gull resistome. Previous studies of AR genes in gulls and
other wildlife have relied on initial cultivation of bacteria or PCR
of speciﬁc, known gene variants. However, studies using functional

metagenomics have revealed a diverse array of previously unde-
scribed AR genes in soils (Rondon et al., 2000) and humans
(Diaz-Torres et al., 2006; Sommer et al., 2009). We assay: (1) the
most abundant AR classes and gene types within these classes
that confer resistance to four antibiotics; (2) information about
the genes’ genomic context (i.e., the genomic neighborhood) as
revealed by the ﬂanking sequences; and (3) microdiversity within
the abundant gene types. Speciﬁcally, we screened the libraries
for resistance against ampicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, and tetra-
cycline. These four antibiotics were chosen due their historical
importance, differences in resistance mechanism, and range of tar-
get organisms. Penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin are β-lactam
antibiotics. In the past 20 years, bacterial strains that produced
extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) – enzymes conferring
broad resistance to β-lactam antibiotics – have emerged posing a
major threat to public health (Pitout and Laupland, 2008). Tetracy-
clines have been used for more than 40 years in clinical and agricul-
tural settings and are broad-spectrum agents, exhibiting activity
against a wide range of organisms (Chopra and Roberts, 2001).
Resistance to tetracyclines is also widespread in the environment
(e.g., Nascimento et al., 2003; Bryan et al., 2004).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLING
Fecal samples were collected from four Herring Gulls in a breeding
colony at the Shoals Marine Laboratory on Appledore Island, ME
(42˚ 58
W) located approximately 10 km off the coast of
mainland United States. Approximately 650 pairs of Herring Gulls
nest on the island (Ellis, unpublished data). We collected fresh
samples by observing individual birds until defecation occurred
and immediately collecting samples from the ground using a ster-
ile syringe. For comparison, one soil and two gull samples were also
collected from the mainland (Rochester, NH, USA). Samples were
immediately placed on ice. DNA extraction was performed with
the FastDNA Spin for Soil kit (MP Biomedical, CA, USA) using
the protocol of the manufacturer with the following changes. Cells
were lysed using the MP Biomedicals FastPrep24 (setting 5.0 twice
for 45 s and once for 20 s, cooling on ice in between). The precipi-
tation step was carried out twice with 250 μl protein precipitation
solution (PPS) from the FastDNA Spin for Soil kit (MP Biomed-
ical, CA, USA). We used 1.5 ml binding matrix and inverted for
4 min. We discarded 1 ml of the supernatant. The ﬁnal pellet was
resuspended in 75 μl of the provided water.

CLONING AND SCREENING
Three micrograms of genomic DNA from gull feces was sheared to
a target size of 3 kb with a Covaris S2 instrument (Covaris Inc., MA,
USA). The 3-kb fragments were end-repaired with the DNA Ter-
minator End Repair kit (Lucigen, WI, USA). The DNA was loaded
on a 1% low melt agarose gel and fragments between 1 and 3 kb
were extracted with Zymoclean Gel Recovery kit (Zymo Research,
CA, USA). DNA was eluted in 10 μl TE elution buffer and ligated
into pSMART–HCkan vector (accession number AF532107) using
the Clonesmart blunt end cloning kit (Lucigen,WI, USA). Ligation
was carried out overnight at room temperature. E. coli 10G elec-
trocompetent cells (Lucigen, WI, USA) were transformed by elec-
troporation using a BTX electroporator and 1.0 mm gap cuvettes.

Electroporation conditions were 25 μF, 200 Ω, and 1800 V. The
transformation was incubated for 1 h at 37˚C and, after adding
30 μg/ml kanamycin, the transformation mixture was incubated
another 2 h at 37˚C. We plated 0.1 μl of the transformation mixture
on kanamycin LB plates for titer counts and 100–200 μl on ampi-
cillin (50 μg/ml), amoxicillin (20 μg/ml), penicillin (50 μg/ml),
and tetracycline (8 μg/ml) containing plates. Screened clones were
picked and grown up over night without shaking in LB+ 10%
glycerol. Sequencing was done using the SL1 forward primer
(cid:2)
(5
) and SR2 reverse primer
(cid:2)
(5
; as suggested by
Lucigen) and sequenced at Beckman Coulter Genomics.

MINIMAL INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION
Antibiotic resistance clones were tested in duplicate for growth in
the following concentrations of ampicillin: 60, 100, 200, 350, 500,
800, and 1000 μg/ml. Five microliters of live culture was inoculated
into 96-well plates containing 225 μl LB Broth plus kanamycin
(30 μg/ml) and the above concentrations of ampicillin. We also
included a “no-cell” control for contamination and background
OD. The cultures were incubated at 37˚C and growth was measured
at OD600 every 15 min for 24 h.

Tn5 TRANSPOSON “KNOCKOUT” OF AR GENES
To identify the AR gene in selected inserts, we randomly inserted a
Tn5 transposon in the clones using the EZ-TN5 <TET-1> Inser-
tion Kit (Epicentre, CA, USA). We used a molar ratio Tn5 to AR
plasmid of one to minimize multiple insertion events. One micro-
liter of a transposon reaction was electroporated (BioRad BTX)
into 50 μl of E. Cloni 10G Electrocompetent Cells (Lucigen).
Cells were plated on LB Agar containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml)
and tetracycline (10 μg/ml). Colonies were next screened for Tn5
“knockouts”based on lack of ampicillin resistance in LB Broth plus
kanamycin (30 μg/ml), tetracycline (10 μg/ml), and ampicillin
(60 μg/ml). A replicate control 96-plate was also inoculated with
the same colony in LB Broth plus kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and tetra-
cycline (10 μg/ml). Both plates were grown at 37˚C (without shak-
ing) overnight. Sequencing was done using the TN5 <TET-1>
forward and reverse primers (provided in Epicentre kit).

SEQUENCE ANALYSIS
We trimmed the paired-end sequences using Phrap and analyzed
the inserts using blast against both GenBank nr and the Antibiotic
Resistance Genes Database (ARDB; Liu and Pop, 2009). For β-
lactamases, the ARDB classiﬁcation scheme generally follows other
systems for organizing resistance genes (Bush and Jacoby, 2010).
However, here we rely entirely on a sequence-based comparison.
Using ARDB, genes are divided into the four major β-lactamase
classes (A–D), then into speciﬁc ARDB types, and ﬁnally into
sequence variants within each type. We detected some sequences
that were identical to β-lactamases used in common cloning vec-
tors; because we cannot determine whether these sequences are
contaminants we removed them from the analysis.

Sequences from each ARDB type were assembled into con-
tigs using Geneious (Biomatters). For selected inserts, we aligned
and translated the sequences and built phylogenetic trees with
Phylip (100 bootstraps) using neighbor-joining (protein distance

likelihood methods (Jones–Taylor–Thornton correction and con-
stant rate of change among sites; Felsenstein, 2006). The phy-
logenetic trees were visualized with the Interactive Tree of Life
(iTOL, http://itol.embl.de/index.shtml; Letunic and Bork, 2007).
Sequences from this study have been submitted to GenBank under
accession numbers JM426721–JM427844.

RESULTS
AR GENE DIVERSITY
To target AR in gulls, we sampled feces from four gulls on Apple-
dore Island, Maine, and two gulls in Rochester, NH, USA. For
comparison, we also sampled soil in Rochester without any gulls
nearby (Table 1). We extracted and sheared the DNA, then cloned
3 kbp DNA fragments into E. coli. The number of resulting clones
ranged between 1× 105 and 4.4× 106 per library. Based on these
numbers, we estimate that up to 5% of the bacteria in gull feces
are resistant to antibiotics (Table 1). We found ampicillin, amox-
icillin, and penicillin resistance genes in all gulls assayed, whereas
we detected tetracycline AR genes in only two out of six gulls.
Although it is difﬁcult to compare across antibiotics due to differ-
ences in potency and concentration, resistance to ampicillin was
found in higher occurrence than amoxicillin and penicillin.

Gulls carried an extensive genetic diversity of both known
and previously undescribed AR genes. To characterize this diver-
sity in the metagenomic libraries, we paired-end sequenced the
resistant clones and ﬁrst classiﬁed the genes using ARDB (Liu
and Pop, 2009; Tables 2 and 3). Overall, we found that similar
genes conferred resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, and peni-
cillin, including nine different class A and C β-lactamase ARDB
categories. The most common category was bl1_ec, which was
100% similar to a β-lactamase in E. coli strain 1.1.43. Another
common category detected was the extended-spectrum class A β-
lactamase (ARDB category: bl2b_tem1). However, the bl2b_tem1
types were not identical to known variants in the database and
on average shared only 92% sequence similarity. Combined, these
two ARDB categories constituted more than 50% of the AR clones
(Table 2). The last common ARDB category was the class A CTX-M
type. However, these genes only shared 72% amino acid sequence
similarity to CTX-M genes in E. coli (Table 3). A broader search
in GenBank and a phylogenetic analysis revealed that the gene was
100% similar to the β-lactamase variant RAHN-2 in the Gram-
negative enteric bacterium Rahnella aquatilis Y9602 (Ruimy et al.,
2010) and therefore, was likely not a CTX-M variant (Figure 1).

Beyond the class A and class C β-lactamases, we also found
ampicillin- and penicillin- resistant clones encoding for efﬂux

Antibiotic resistance in gulls

pumps (acrA and macB type) and a membrane carboxypeptidase
(ARDB category: pbp1a). Finally, we observed a high proportion
of clones (38%) that had no clear match in ARDB.

The tetracycline resistant genes detected belonged to several
ARDB categories including tet C, tet J, and tet L efﬂux pumps and
tet M, tet O, and tetW ribosomal modiﬁcation proteins. These
genes were generally very similar to known genes (Table 3) and
likely do not constitute new variants.

For comparison, we also analyzed the genetic diversity of AR
in a nearby soil sample. Keeping in mind that we only analyzed
one soil sample, we found a lower frequency of AR genes in the
soil sample compared to the gulls. With the exception of tetW,
all ARDB categories observed in soil were also detected in gulls.
Furthermore, we did not detect the RAHN-2/CTX-M category in
soil. Thus, it appears that many AR genes in gulls are also found
in soil (and vice-versa), with perhaps some exceptions.

GENOMIC NEIGHBORHOOD
Antibiotic resistance genes are known to move around between
hosts via lateral gene transfer, thus the AR gene sequence itself is
not a good indicator of the organism with the gene. Therefore, we
analyzed the ﬂanking sequences around the AR genes (Figure 2;
Tables 2 and 3). Data regarding the genomic neighborhood can
give information about the host organism and/or whether the gene
was located on a mobile genetic element. Our attempts to assemble
clones belonging to the same ARDB category yielded good contigs,
indicating that the detected AR genes shared ﬂanking sequences.
An example of that was the common class C β-lactamase belong-
ing to the ARDB category bl1_ec. All clones associated with this
category were located on a genomic fragment syntenous with E.
coli strain K-12 substr. DH10B and several other E. coli strains
(Figure 2A). Similar to DH10B, the gene was ﬂanked by fumarate
reductase subunits frdB, frdC, and frdD, an outer membrane
lipoprotein (Blc), a quaternary ammonium compound-resistance
protein (sug E), and the toxin entericidin (Durfee et al., 2008).
Overall, this suggests that the most common class C β-lactamase
found in the gulls was located on a genomic fragment similar to
that found in E. coli. Similarly, the β-lactamase variant RAHN-2
also assembled into one contig which suggested a fragment synte-
nous with the genome from R. aquatilis Y9602 (Figure 2B). This
contig including a chemotaxis gene and a hypothetical protein.
This supports the hypothesis that this variant is indeed located in
a Rahnella genome.

In contrast to the bl1_ec and RAHN-2 variants, clones match-
ing the TEM class A β-lactamases (bl2b_tem1) were found in a
range of genetic neighborhoods. The genes ﬂanking bl2b_tem1
sequences were in some cases most closely related to Gram-positive
bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Clostridium) and in
other cases, to Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., E. coli, Shigella, and
Salmonella).

There were two major types of tetracycline resistance genes
in our samples – efﬂux pumps (tet C, tet J, and tet L) and riboso-
mal modiﬁcation proteins (tet M, tet O, and tetW; Table 2). With
the exception of tet J, these were all associated with Gram-positive
bacteria including Bacillus, Enterococcus, and Clostridium. Several
of them were located on what appeared to be mobile elements
including plasmids and transposons.

FIGURE 1 | Phylogenetic tree of the bl2be_ctxm type class A
β-lactamase gene from metagenomic clones. The phylogenetic tree is a
majority rule consensus tree based on protein similarity using
neighbor-joining. Bootstrap values (total 100) are calculated with
neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods. Klebsiella pneumoniae
CTX-M is the outgroup.

AR GENE MICRODIVERSITY
In addition to detecting multiple classes of AR genes, we found sev-
eral DNA polymorphisms in the bl1_ec type. To further explore
this result, we aligned the sequences matching this ARDB type
and built a phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). All gull bl1_ec sequences
grouped with E. coli 1.1.43 with high bootstrap support. In con-
trast, sequences retrieved from the soil samples formed three
separate clades, with only one soil clone clustering with the gull
variants. Instead, the one clade of soil AR sequences were 100%
similar to E. coli H120, whereas the other genes branched away
from known E. coli genes. Overall, this indicates that the bl1_ec
diversity is related to its environmental origin. We also analyzed the
sequence variation among clones from the RAHN-2 β-lactamase
genes but only observed one variant.

CHARACTERIZATION OF UNDESCRIBED AR GENES
In addition to the known AR gene categories in ARDB, we
detected 31 gene types not previously described (Table 3). The

novel AR genes were associated with a wide range of phyloge-
netic lineages including Pseudomonas, Bacteroides, Gram-positives,
Verrucomicrobia, and different genera afﬁliated with Enterobacte-
riaceae. To further characterize these, we ﬁrst measured the min-
imum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ampicillin. All ampi-
cillin/penicillin/amoxicillin resistant clones had an MIC above
1000 μg/ml ampicillin and thus clearly conferred resistance to this
antibiotic.

Two of these clones assembled to a 2800-bp DNA fragment
(unk15 in Table 3). One end of the fragment shared 84%
amino acid similarity to the hypothetical protein VspiD_21980
in Verrucomicrobium spinosum from the phylum Verrucomicro-
bia. The other part of the fragment was 45% similar to a C-
terminal protease in Gemmata obscuriglobus from the phylum
Planctomycetes.

We next identiﬁed the genomic region in the clone that encoded
for AR by randomly inserting a Tn5 transposon followed by testing
for ampicillin resistance and DNA sequencing of the clones. The
Tn5 “knockout” revealed that insertions in both genes interrupted
the resistance whereas several insertions between the two genes
had no effect. This represents a completely novel AR gene system
that confers resistance in E. coli, but at present, we do not know the
speciﬁc mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
study to identify an AR gene in either the phylum Verrucomicrobia
or Planctomycetes.

A second previously uncharacterized AR gene (unk1) shared
85% amino acid similarity to a protein in the Gram-positive
Carnobacterium sp. AT7 that was annotated as a putative DNA
repair protein. A Tn5 insertion in this gene interrupted the
resistance. Next to this putative AR gene was a gene 85% simi-
lar to pilT in another Gram-positive lineage, Enterococcus faecalis.
Another previous unrecognized AR gene (unk31) was 92% similar
to a DNA repair gene of the ImpB/MucB/SamB family in Lacto-
bacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens KCTC 3535. Multiple Tn5
insertions in this gene also interrupted the resistance. None of
these DNA repair genes have previously been shown to confer AR,
so the exact mechanism of resistance is unclear.

DISCUSSION
Using a functional metagenomics approach, we detected an exten-
sive diversity of AR genes in gulls, including both well-known and
undescribed AR genes. Less than half of the gene types detected
have been reported previously in gulls (Table 2). We also detected

several completely unknown AR genes including one associated
with the lesser-known phyla Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes.
These results highlight the strength of the functional metagenomic
approach: the ability to reveal the most abundant genes confer-
ring resistance to a particular antibiotic, without requiring prior
knowledge of the gene classes of interest. In contrast, most studies
of antimicrobial resistance have used PCR to characterize speciﬁc
AR genes, often known from clinically relevant bacterial isolates
(such as, E. coli, Salmonella, Enterococcus spp. – see references in
Table 2). Our results suggest that these previous studies, while use-
ful, may impart a heavily biased view of the AR genes carried by
wild animals.

The functional metagenomic approach also has several advan-
tages over a straight sequencing-based metagenomic analysis of
a community. By including a functional screening, we can iden-
tify previously unknown AR genes that we would not have been
able to identify by sequence homology searches (e.g., Sommer
et al., 2009). Further, most metagenomic analyses only target
the most abundant lineages, whereas the functional metage-
nomic approach allows for screening even rare members in the
community.

Of course, there are limitations to the method used here.
The approach is unlikely to detect mechanisms that require large
(>3 kb) gene cassettes or that confer resistance by modifying reg-
ulation of genes in another genomic region (Viveiros et al., 2007).
Further, it will only ﬁnd AR genes that confer resistance in E.
coli. Nonetheless, 42% of the gene types we detected originated
from Gram-positive hosts (e.g., Enterococcus and Clostridium) as
well as lesser-studied phyla like Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes.
This indicates that this bias may not be as dramatic as would
be expected. Further, the functional assay yields the additional
useful information that the genes are expressed in E. coli and there-
fore have the potential to be transferred and functional in human
pathogens.

Wild animals are probably natural reservoirs of AR bacteria and
genes, carrying them as part of their commensal ﬂora (Wright,
2010). Alternatively, animals may acquire AR genes through expo-
sure to human activities, including agriculture and animal hus-
bandry (Osterblad et al., 2001). Without a much broader under-
standing of natural AR gene diversity, we cannot determine the
source of AR genes in gulls. However, the gulls sampled in this
study carried a variety of AR genes that are commonly found
in bacteria isolated from humans and domestic animals. This

Antibiotic resistance in gulls

result, similar to that of other recent studies of gulls and other
wildlife, suggests that AR genes arising from the use of antibiotics
in humans and animals may have spread to wildlife. The genes may
then be further disseminated by wild animals, particular those that
migrate long distances such as birds (Sjolund et al., 2008; Drobni
et al., 2009).

Studies of gull ecology conducted at Appledore Island, Maine
(where most of our samples were taken) indicate that gulls not
only carry AR genes, but also have the potential to be a vector
of the genes between human-dominated habitats and the envi-
ronment. Appledore-banded gulls have been found at a variety
of human habitats across New England and as far away as Florida
(Ellis, unpublished data). They have been observed loaﬁng at land-
ﬁlls and wastewater treatment plants and share strains of E. coli
in common with wastewater from these sites (Nelson et al., 2008).
Garbage brought back from the mainland is also a large part of
the diet of gulls on Appledore Island (Ellis et al., 2005). Finally,
the birds are frequently observed at public beaches in coastal New
Hampshire and Maine during the summer, where they come into
close contact with humans. Thus, the combination of the traveling
patterns of gulls and the extensive diversity of AR genes that they
carry suggest that gulls may be important vectors for spreading
AR genes in areas where humans live.

The most common gene detected in our study was bl1_ec, a
class C β-lactamase. The microdiversity within this gene type pro-
vides further evidence that gulls could move AR genes from human
habitats to the environment. The gull variants were highly simi-
lar (some sharing 100% aa identity) to that of E. coli 1.1.43, an
isolate from a human gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, while the
soil sample contained the gull variant, it also contained sequence
diversity that did not match any known clinical isolates. Hence, gull
AR gene diversity does not appear to simply reﬂect the diversity
found in soils (and therefore, perhaps, the broader environment),
although further work is needed to conﬁrm this hypothesis.

Class A β-lactamases were also common in our samples. In a
recent study of AR in Alaskan soil, class B β-lactamases were most
common (Allen et al., 2009). We did not detect any class B types
from our samples, however, indicating that the relative abundance
of β-lactamase classes may vary by environment or location.

Only two of the ARDB β-lactamase gene types that we identiﬁed
have been reported previously in gulls (Table 2). Notably, one of
these genes was classiﬁed as a CTX-M-like ESBL. ESBL-producing
organisms are a major public health concern in clinics and com-
munities (Pitout and Laupland, 2008). However, the variant was
also 100% similar to that previously found in R. aquatilis (Enter-
obacteriaceae), and the ﬂanking sequences also suggest a Rahnella
host. Rahnella has been implicated in several instances of infec-
tious disease in humans, causing bacteremia (Chang et al., 1999;
Tash, 2005). R. aquatilis has also been found in the guts of insects
(e.g., Morales-Jimenez et al., 2009) and a wild ﬁsh (Skrodenyte-
Arbaciauskiene et al., 2008); however, as far as we know, this is the
ﬁrst report of the genus in a wild bird.

Although we generally detected few tetracycline resistance genes
in our samples, we identiﬁed ﬁve known tetracycline resistance
gene types in gulls and a sixth type in soil. tet L and tet M have
been reported before in a few studies of gulls and other wildlife
(Table 1). Notably we did not detect tetA and tet B, which have

FIGURE 3 | Phylogenetic tree of the bl1_ec type class C β-lactamase
gene from metagenomic clones and sequenced representative strains
from ARDB. The sequenced clones are from samples from gulls or soil,
whereas we did not detect any bl1_ec type clones in samples from
wastewater. Metagenomic clones were isolated on ampicillin, amoxicillin,
or penicillin as listed for each entry. The phylogenetic tree is a majority rule
consensus tree based on protein similarity using neighbor-joining. Bootstrap
values (total 100) are calculated with neighbor-joining and maximum
likelihood methods. Edwardsiella tarda sp. EIB202 is the outgroup.

been widely reported in other wildlife (e.g., Silva et al., 2010; Alroy
and Ellis, 2011). The gene tetW has only been reported in one
study of wild animals (Jeters et al., 2009). tet C has also only been
reported in one other study of wildlife; the gene was found in small
rodents trapped at swine farms, suggesting that the presence of the
gene may have resulted from agricultural use of antibiotics. Inter-
estingly, several other studies were unable to detect tet C in wildlife
using PCR (e.g., Rybarikova et al., 2010; Ahmad et al., 2011). One
other study of wild animals detected tet O in houseﬂies and Ger-
man cockroaches at swine farms (Ahmad et al., 2011). Thus, gulls
from Appledore Island may have acquired some tet genes from
agricultural sources.

In addition to these well-known AR genes, both gulls and soil
also harbor a variety of previously unknown AR genes. Given that
the genes confer resistance in E. coli, they clearly have the poten-
tial to be functional in human pathogens. Some of these genes
may have originally derived from human bacteria and have yet
to be detected in clinical settings. Indeed, Sommer et al. (2009)
detected a variety of novel AR genes in healthy humans using the

same method. Alternatively, the genes may be intrinsic to the birds’
commensal ﬂora or more broadly, to the environment. In this case,
the mixing of human and gull fecal bacteria could result in novel
combinations and mechanisms of AR in human beings.

In conclusion, by using a functional metagenomics approach,
this study more than doubled the number of clinically relevant AR
gene types known to be carried by gulls or by wildlife in general.
Together with the propensity of gulls to visit human-dominated
habitats, this high diversity of AR gene types suggests that gulls
can facilitate the spread of AR. Further, the large number of novel
genes that we identiﬁed suggests that gulls also have the potential to
introduce new mechanisms of AR back to the human microﬂora.
