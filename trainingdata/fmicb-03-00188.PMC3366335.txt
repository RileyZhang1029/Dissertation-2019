The presence of biogenic amines (BAs) in raw and processed seafood, associated with
either time/temperature conditions or food technologies is discussed in the present paper
from a safety and prevention point of view. In particular, storage temperature, handling
practices, presence of microbial populations with decarboxylase activity and availability
of free amino acids are considered the most important factors affecting the production
of BAs in raw seafood. On the other hand, some food technological treatments such as
salting, ripening, fermentation, or marination can increase the levels of BAs in processed
seafood. The consumption of high amount of BAs, above all histamine, can result in food
borne poisoning which is a worldwide problem. The European Regulation established as
maximum limits for histamine, in ﬁshery products from ﬁsh species associated with high
histidine amounts, values ranging from 100 to 200 mg/kg, while for products which have
undergone enzyme maturation treatment in brine, the aforementioned limits rise to 200
and 400 mg/kg. Preventive measures and emerging methods aiming at controlling the
production of BAs are also reported for potential application in seafood industries.

INTRODUCTION
Seafood may harbor a number of biological, chemical, and physi-
cal hazards, the most prevalent of which are biogenic amines (BAs)
and biotoxins (chemical), pathogenic bacteria and viruses (biolog-
ical), and metal inclusion (physical). BAs are low molecular weight
organic bases with biological activity that are formed in foods by
microbial decarboxylation of the corresponding amino acids or by
transamination of aldehydes and ketones by amino acid transam-
inases (Zhai et al., 2012). The most important BAs, histamine,
tyramine, tryptamine, putrescine, and cadaverine, are formed
from free amino acids namely histidine, tyrosine, tryptophane,
ornithine and lysine, respectively. Spermidine and spermine arise
from putrescine (Zarei et al., 2011). Putrescine, cadaverine, sper-
midine, and spermine have an aliphatic structure; histamine,
and tryptamine have a heterocyclic structure and tyramine and
phenylethylamine have an aromatic structure (Mohamed et al.,
2009). The free amino acids either occur as such in foods or may
be liberated through proteolysis. In addition to the availability of
precursors (amino acids), BAs accumulation in foods requires the
presence of microorganisms with amino acid decarboxylases and
favorable conditions for their growth and decarboxylation activ-
ity (Zarei et al., 2011). Storage temperature is the most important
factor contributing to BAs formation (Chong et al., 2011). Other
parameters (i.e., pH, water activity, NaCl concentration, additives)
may inﬂuence the variation of microbiota composition and lead
to the differences in BAs content (Suzzi and Gardini, 2003). In
addition, modiﬁed atmosphere packaging and vacuum packaging
represent popular preservation methods which may inhibit the
growth and increase the lag phase of microorganisms with amino
acid decarboxylase activity (Chong et al., 2011).

The toxicological

level of BAs is very difﬁcult to estab-
lish because it depends on individual characteristics and the

presence of other amines. However, a maximum total BAs level
of 750–900 mg/kg has been proposed (Ladero et al., 2010).

The microbiological complexity of seafood is linked to the spe-
ciﬁc as well as non-speciﬁc microbial contaminants originating
from the natural environment or being acquired during process-
ing. The wide range of environmental habitats (freshwater to
saltwater, tropical waters to arctic waters, pelagic swimmers to
bottom dwellers, and degree of pollution) and the variety of pro-
cessing practices (iced ﬁsh products to canned products) are all
important factors in determining the initial contamination of ﬁsh
and ﬁsh products (Gram and Huss, 1996). The types of bacte-
ria that are associated with histamine production are commonly
present in the saltwater environment. They naturally exist on the
gills, on external surfaces, and in the gut of live, saltwater ﬁsh,
with no harm to the ﬁsh. Upon death, the defense mechanisms
of the ﬁsh no longer inhibit bacterial growth in the muscle tis-
sue, and histamine-forming bacteria may start to grow, resulting
in the production of BAs [Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
2011]. Evisceration and removal of the gills may reduce, but not
eliminate, the number of histamine-forming bacteria. Packing of
the visceral cavity with ice may aid in chilling large ﬁsh in which
internal muscle temperatures are not easily reduced. However,
when done improperly, these steps may accelerate the process
of histamine development in the edible portions of the ﬁsh by
spreading the bacteria from the visceral cavity to the ﬂesh of the
ﬁsh. With some harvesting practices, such as long-lining and gill-
netting, death may occur many hours before the ﬁsh is removed
from the water. Under the worst conditions, histamine forma-
tion can already be under way before the ﬁsh is brought onboard
the vessel. This condition can be further aggravated with certain
tuna species that generate heat, resulting in internal temperatures
that may exceed environmental temperatures and increasing the

likelihood of conditions favorable to growth of enzyme-forming
bacteria (FDA, 2011).

Some technological processes such as salting, ripening, fermen-
tation or marination can increase the possibility of formation of
BAs. A low pH (4.0–5.5), which can be achieved in salted anchovies,
for instance, is favorable for enhanced amino acid decarboxylase
activity (Pons-Sánchez-Cascado et al., 2005a). Moreover, impor-
tant proteolysis is observed during ripening of salted anchovies,
resulting in the liberation of peptides and free amino acids includ-
ing histidine (Hernández-Herrero et al., 2002). The association of
salted ﬁsh with histamine formation is probably due to the pres-
ence of halophilic or halotolerant microorganisms. For instance,
Hernández-Herrero et al. (1999) reported that Staphylococcus epi-
dermidis and Staphylococcus capitis, isolated from salted anchovies,
showed a powerful histamine-forming activity, producing 1000
and 400 μg/ml, respectively. They assumed that the presence of
these bacteria could be the result of contamination of ﬁsh dur-
ing capture and subsequent unhygienic handling. BAs can also be
produced throughout the manufacturing process, as well as during
storage of the end product if improper holding temperatures are
employed (Periago et al., 2003; Yongsawatdigul et al., 2004).

BACTERIA IN FISH
The microorganisms of ﬁsh intended for human consumption
depend on the environmental conditions of its natural habitat. In
particular, the microﬂora of ﬁsh from temperate water consists
primarily psychrotrophic Gram-negative bacteria belonging to
the genera Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Acinetobacter, Shewanella, and
Flavobacterium. Members of the Vibrionaceae (Vibrio and Photo-
bacterium) and the Aeromonadaceae (Aeromonas spp.) families are
also common aquatic bacteria and typical of the ﬁsh ﬂora [Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 1995]. Although Gram-
negative bacteria are the predominant microorganisms in ﬁsh,
Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus, Micrococcus, Clostridium,
Lactobacillus, and coryneforms can also be found at various levels.
Aeromonas spp. are typical of freshwater ﬁsh, whereas a number
of bacterial genera such as Vibrio, Photobacterium, and Shewanella
require sodium for growth and are, thus, typical of marine waters
(Gram et al., 1990). In polluted waters, high numbers of Enterobac-
teriaceae may be found. In clean temperate waters, these organisms
disappear rapidly, but it has been shown that Escherichia coli and
Salmonella can survive for very long periods in tropical waters,
and that once introduced, they may become indigenous to the
environment (Fujioka et al., 1988).

The composition of ﬁsh microbiota changes quite dramati-
cally during spoilage. Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa have been identiﬁed as the prominent spoilage bacte-
ria of fresh ﬁsh (Gram and Huss, 1996). At ambient temperature
(25˚C), the microbiota at the point of spoilage is dominated by
mesophilic Vibrionaceae and, particularly if the ﬁsh is caught in
polluted waters, Enterobacteriaceae. Some Pseudomonas spp. are
the speciﬁc spoilers of iced stored tropical freshwater ﬁsh and
are also spoilers of marine tropical ﬁsh stored in ice (Gram and
Huss, 1996). Many different bacterial species of the Enterobac-
teriaceae family are known to possess histidine decarboxylase
activity and have the ability to produce histamine, including the
species Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Hafnia alvei,

Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enter-
obacter cloacae, Serratia fonticola, Serratia liquefaciens, Raoultella
(formerly Klebsiella) planticola, Raoultella ornithinolytica, Prov-
idencia stuartii, and Citrobacter freundii (Kim et al., 2003). In
addition to the enteric bacteria, Clostridium spp., Vibrio alginolyti-
cus, Acinetobacter lowfﬁ, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Pseudomonas
putida, Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens, Aeromonas spp., and Photobac-
terium spp. have also been reported as histamine formers (Chen
et al., 2010). Emborg et al. (2006) identiﬁed Morganella psychrotol-
erans, a strong histamine-former, as a novel psychrotolerant bac-
terium, whereas the study of Kanki et al. (2004) revealed that these
low temperature-adapted bacteria could play a role in scombroid
poisoning.

BIOGENIC AMINES PRODUCTION IN RAW SEAFOOD
Histamine levels in freshly caught ﬁsh are generally low, usually
below 0.1 mg/100 g (Auerswald et al., 2006). At any time, expo-
sure of certain ﬁsh to elevated temperatures after the catch and
before consumption can cause formation of histamine from his-
tidine by bacterial histidine decarboxylases. While most studies
agree that histamine formation is negligible in ﬁsh stored at 0˚C or
below, data concerning storage conditions at higher temperatures
are variable and do not allow for the establishment of standard pro-
cedures for avoiding potential negative effects of transport/storage
conditions on ﬁsh safety (Rossano et al., 2006). However, ﬁsh is
more likely to form BAs when decomposition occurs at harvest or
in the ﬁrst stages of handling on the ﬁshing vessels, rather than
later in the distribution chain (Staruszkiewicz et al., 2004).

The term “scombroid” is derived from the name of the family
Scombridae which includes the ﬁsh species that were ﬁrst impli-
cated in histamine intoxication (i.e., tuna and mackerel). These
species of ﬁsh share in common high levels of free histidine in their
muscle tissues. It is known that other non-scombroid ﬁsh species
are also implicated in scombroid poisoning, such as mahi-mahi
(Coryphaena spp.), sardines (Sardinella spp.), pilchards (Sardina
pilchardus), anchovies (Engraulis spp.), herring (Clupea spp.),
marlin (Makaira spp.), blueﬁsh (Pomatomus spp.), Western Aus-
tralian salmon (Arripis truttaceus), sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus
nerka), amberjack (Seriola spp.), Cape yellowtail (Seriola lalandii),
and swordﬁsh (Xiphias gladius). With the exception of salmon
and swordﬁsh, most of these ﬁsh species are rich in free histidine
(Hungerford, 2010). However, it has been found that histamine
poisoning may not be caused to all the people consuming contami-
nated ﬁsh. Given that histamine-forming bacteria may be diversely
distributed in ﬁsh, the diffusion of produced histamine may also
vary widely in different parts of the animal. For instance, while
50 mg/kg of histamine may be found in one ﬁsh section, its level
may exceed 500 mg/kg in another (FDA, 2011). Thus, even if the
same histamine-containing ﬁsh is ingested, some consumers may
be poisoned and some may not (Tao et al., 2002, 2009).

Histamine is produced in raw ﬁsh from the action of bacterial
histidine decarboxylase following temperature/time abuse. Pro-
duction of histamine is greater, however, at high abusive tempera-
tures (21.1˚C or higher) than at moderate abusive temperatures
(7.2˚C), while its generation is particularly rapid at tempera-
tures near 32.2˚C (FDA, 2011). According to European Regulation

cooked and chilled products from crustaceans and mollusks must
be maintained at a temperature approaching that of melting ice
(European Commission, 2004). Rapid chilling of scombrotoxin-
forming ﬁsh immediately after death is the most important ele-
ment in any strategy for preventing the formation of histamine,
especially for ﬁsh that is exposed to warm waters or air, and for
tunas which generate heat in their tissues. Failure to chill onboard
may permit bacteria and enzymes, including those that form his-
tamine, to increase to high levels (FDA, 2011). Even if ice storage
is recommended, temperature/time abuse conditions often occur
in the ﬁsh merchandising chain. Delays in removing ﬁsh from the
water after capture, such as those captured by a longline, may sig-
niﬁcantly limit the amount of time left for chilling and may allow
some ﬁsh to heat up. Moreover, mishandling coupled with high
temperature abuse are likely when handling ﬁsh and may signiﬁ-
cantly enhance histamine formation. The amount of post-harvest
time at elevated temperatures (after proper chilling onboard the
harvest vessel) to which a ﬁsh can be exposed (e.g., during pro-
cessing, storage, and distribution) without adverse effects depends
primarily on whether the ﬁsh was previously frozen (e.g., in the
harvest vessel) or heat-processed sufﬁciently to destroy histamine-
forming bacteria (FDA, 2011). Rossano et al. (2006) studied the
inﬂuence of storage temperature and time of freezing on hista-
mine formation in anchovies, showing the ability of freezing to
inhibit or slow down its formation.

Many scientists have studied the effects of storage tempera-
tures on histamine formation in ﬁsh and their results have been
very often ambiguous. This can be explained by the differences
in the composition and the level of microorganisms in the ﬁsh.
Histamine producing bacterial species and strains vary consider-
ably in amounts of histamine formation, and the type of spoilage
bacteria present depends on the aquatic environment. It has been
reported that M. morganii, K. pneumoniae, and P. vulgaris are pro-
liﬁc histamine formers, producing >1000 mg/kg in the culture
broth (López-Sabater et al., 1996; Rawles et al., 1996; Kim et al.,
2001). These species have rarely been detected in fresh ﬁsh, but
have mostly been isolated from ﬁsh spoiled under controlled stor-
age conditions, above 20˚C (Ababouch et al., 1991; Kim et al.,
2001). Bacteria occurring naturally in marine environments such
as Photobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp.,Vibrio alginolyticus, and
Aeromonas spp. have indeed been frequently isolated from ﬁsh
stored at refrigeration temperature for extended periods (Middle-
brooks et al., 1988; Morli et al., 1988). However they are weak
histamine formers, producing <500 mg/kg in the culture broth
(Frank et al., 1985). Then, in raw ﬁsh histamine content is linked
to the type of histamine-forming bacteria, the type of seafood, and
temperature/time storage conditions (Table 1). Typically, boats
ﬁsh overnight in a trip of up to 12 h. Storage is at ambient temper-
ature until unloaded at the processing plant, with the ﬁrst-caught
ﬁsh being already stored for up to 10 h. Such a long period may
cause histamine-producers to undergo nine doublings, an increase
of 1000 times (three log scales) over the assumed initial level of 10/g
or cm2, reaching a level of 10000/cm2 at ﬁsh surfaces or 10000/g
in the gut (FAO, 2004).

In addition to their toxicological implications, BAs are related
to ﬁsh spoilage, since they accumulate as a result of the prote-
olytic and amino acid decarboxylase activity of microorganisms

(Table 2). The use of more than a single BA (i.e., a BA index
that consists of a combination of BAs) can be used as a qual-
ity indicator for ﬁsh freshness. Some examples are the sum of
cadaverine and putrescine (Stede and Stockemer, 1981), the index
of Mietz and Karmas (1981), which considers the increases in
putrescine, cadaverine and histamine levels along with the cor-
responding decreases in spermidine and spermine, as well as the
index described by Veciana-Nogués et al. (1997a) for tuna, which
includes putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, and tyramine. In their
study, Baixas-Nogueras et al. (2005) used these indexes for the
freshness evaluation of iced Mediterranean hake (Merluccius mer-
luccius) in the chilling conditions as applied in the merchandising
chain. Putrescine and cadaverine were the main amines accu-
mulated, whereas histamine and tyramine were less abundant.
Cadaverine was the amine best correlated with S. putrefaciens, the
speciﬁc spoilage organism, while putrescine showed the most satis-
factory correlation with the genus Pseudomonas. According to the

obtained results, the authors proposed a BAs index limit of accept-
ability in a range of 15–20 μg/g. The study of Veciana-Nogués
et al. (1997a), indeed, considered BAs as hygienic quality indica-
tors in tuna (Thunnus thynnus), a ﬁsh belonging to the Scombridae
family and therefore, with high levels of free histidine in its mus-
cle. So, the value of 50 μg/g for the sum of histamine, tyramine,
putrescine, and cadaverine, which was not exceeded in samples
stored at 0˚C before organoleptic rejection, was proposed as a
guiding limit value for tuna acceptance.

BIOGENIC AMINES IN PROCESSED SEAFOOD
BAs formation is possible during processes such as brining, salt-
ing, smoking, drying, fermenting, and pickling until the product
is fully shelf-stable (Table 3). Refrigeration can be used to inhibit
histamine formation during these processes (FDA, 2011). Sam-
ples of fermented ﬁsh products (ﬁsh sauce, ﬁsh paste, and shrimp
paste) were analyzed for histamine content (Tsai et al., 2006), which
was 394, 263, and 382 mg/kg, respectively. Three ﬁsh sauces, two
ﬁsh pastes, and two shrimp paste products contained greater than
500 mg/kg of histamine. Moreover 7.4% of the tested samples
contained >1000 mg/kg. The average content of various BAs in
tested samples was less than 90 mg/kg. The ﬁsh paste Rihaakuru,
which is an important condiment in the Maldives, could con-
tain high concentrations of BAs, due to raw tuna, from which
the product is made from, being subjected to temperature abuse.
Twenty-eight samples of Rihaakuru (Naila et al., 2011), were ana-
lyzed for some BAs; in particular, histamine was detected at the
highest concentration (5487 mg/kg). Tryptamine was not detected
in most of the samples (only three samples contained <5 mg/kg)
and phenylethylamine only occurred at low levels (<25 mg/kg).
The authors supposed that the histamine found in Rihaakuru
samples was most likely to have originated from Gram-negative
bacteria growing in the ﬁsh before processing or within the ﬁsh
during the early steps of manufacture. There are other processed
seafood which have been investigated for BAs content. In south-
ern China, three ﬁsh products are widely consumed: salted and
fermented ﬁsh, canned ﬁsh, and packaged ﬁsh. Zhai et al. (2012)
examined 49 ﬁsh products from the China market. The max-
imum total BAs content of lightly cured horse mackerel was
484.42 mg/kg compared to 167.86 mg/kg or less for the other salted
and fermented ﬁsh products. In the Spanish mackerel sample,
histamine was detected within the range of 15.74–28.70 mg/kg,
whereas the maximum histamine level was 26.95 mg/kg in canned
anchovies, 22.38 mg/kg in canned sardines and less than 10 mg/kg
in all other canned samples tested (Zhai et al., 2012). Mah et al.
(2002) found high levels of histamine (155–579 mg/kg) in fer-
mented ﬁsh products made from anchovies, whereas Huang et al.
(2010) reported large amounts of histamine in dried ﬁsh products
(63.1–479.0 mg/kg).

Ripened, semi-preserved anchovies are prepared from ﬁsh of
the Engraulis encrasicholus species, and are a common tradition
in some Mediterranean countries. Pons-Sánchez-Cascado et al.
(2005a) studied BAs in salt-ripened anchovies reporting that
tyramine was the most abundant amine, reaching values up to
90 mg/kg, whereas histamine did not exceed 20 mg/kg. Then, the
same authors analyzed samples of vinegar-marinated anchovies
and reported higher values for tyramine than histamine (7.81

and 0.54 mg/kg, respectively) in 14 days of refrigerated storage
(Pons-Sánchez-Cascado et al., 2005b).

The applicability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in ferment-
ing whole ﬁsh has been demonstrated. The fermentation process
for ﬁsh may fulﬁll the conditions required for abundant forma-
tion of BAs, i.e., availability of free amino acids, the presence
of decarboxylase-positive microorganisms and conditions allow-
ing bacterial growth, decarboxylase synthesis, and decarboxylase
activity (Petäjä et al., 2000). Some ﬁsh sauce products, particu-
larly those made from sardine and mackerel, often contain large
quantities of histamine, about 1000 mg/l or greater (Tsai et al.,
2006; Kuda and Miyawaki, 2010), as a result of the histidine
decarboxylase of Tetragenococcus spp., a halophilic lactic acid bac-
terium. However, most studies (Thapa et al., 2006; Muñoz-Atienza
et al., 2011) showed that in fermented ﬁsh products LAB pro-
duced no histamine or other BAs. Kuda et al. (2012) reported
the possibility of regulation of histamine accumulation in salted
and fermented ﬁsh products by the addition of halophilic LAB,
like a starter culture, isolated from nukazuke (salted and fer-
mented ﬁsh with rice bran). In a total of 200 isolates from
nukazuke ﬁsh, 13 strains produced histamine in histidine con-
taining broth (0.5%) at levels more than 200 μg/ml, whereas 130
isolates produced no histamine. Furthermore, 22 of the tested
strains appeared to suppress histamine production (Kuda et al.,
2012).

HISTAMINE FORMATION AND POISONING
Histamine poisoning occurs throughout the world and is perhaps
the most common form of toxicity caused by the ingestion of
ﬁsh (Table 4). However, reliable statistics about its incidence do
not exist because poisoning incidents are often unreported due
to mild symptoms, lack of adequate reporting systems, or misdi-
agnoses by medical personnel of histamine poisoning as a food
allergy (FAO, 2004).

Many BAs have been found in ﬁsh, but only histamine, cadav-
erine, and putrescine have been identiﬁed as signiﬁcant concerns
with regard to ﬁsh safety and quality (Al Bulushi et al., 2009).
Despite the widely accepted association between histamine and
scombroid food poisoning, histamine alone appears to be insuf-
ﬁcient to cause toxicity, and putrescine and cadaverine have been
suggested to potentiate its toxic activity by inhibiting the intestinal
histamine-metabolizing enzymes, diamine oxidase and histamine
N-methyltranferase (Stratton et al., 1991). The onset of scombroid
poisoning is typically from 10 min to 1 h following consumption of
ﬁsh and can last from 12 h to a few days. The symptoms are variable
and include peppery or metallic taste, oral numbness, headache,
dizziness, palpitations, rapid and weak pulse, drop in blood pres-
sure, difﬁculty in swallowing, and thirst. Also noteworthy are
allergy-like symptoms such as hives, rash, ﬂushing, and facial
swelling (Hungerford, 2010). Symptoms involving the central ner-
vous system such as anxiety are less frequently observed. Less
speciﬁc symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps,
and diarrhea are also experienced (Gilbert et al., 1980). Serious
cardiac and respiratory complications may be caused in individu-
als with preexisting conditions (Ascione et al., 1997). In a few rare
cases hospitalization, including treatment for anaphylactic shock,
has been required (Sanchez-Guerrero et al., 1997).

According to the FDA guidelines (FDA, 2011), the toxicity and
defect action levels of histamine, established for tuna, mahi-mahi,
and related ﬁsh, are the 50 mg/100 g and 5 mg/100 g, respectively;
the term “defect action level” refers to the level of histamine natu-
rally or inevitably occurring in foods without, however, presenting
a considerable hazard for humans. According to the EU Regulation
No 2073/2005 nine samples should be taken from each batch of ﬁsh
species of the following families: Scombridae, Clupeidae, Engraul-
idae, Coryfenidae, Pomatomidae, Scombresosidae. These samples
must fulﬁll the following requirements:

Mean value of all samples must not exceed 10 mg/100 g;
Two samples may be >10 mg/100 but <20 mg/100 g;
No sample may exceed 20 mg/100 g.

However, ﬁsh belonging to these families that have undergone
enzyme ripening in brine may have higher histamine levels, but
not more than twice the above values.

ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR BAs DETECTION
The number and variety of methods developed for laboratory hist-
amine testing of ﬁsh and ﬁshery products is impressive. In contrast
to many of the other more potent seafood toxins, the relatively
high action levels established for histamine in ﬁsh allow for its
detection by a variety of different approaches ranging from sim-
ple and inexpensive thin layer chromatography (TLC) procedures
to resource-intensive and more powerful liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods (Hungerford, 2010). Most
of the histamine separation methods applied in ﬁsh use reversed-
phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with
detection schemes based on pre-column derivatization (Mietz
and Karmas, 1978; Hui and Taylor, 1983; Malle et al., 1996) or
post-column derivatization (Glória et al., 1999; Brillantes and
Samosorn, 2001) to produce ﬂuorescent products or strong chro-
mophores, but direct UV detection of histamine imidazole ring
has also been applied (Shakila et al., 2001; Cinquina et al., 2004b).

Other popular separation-based methods include ion chromatog-
raphy (Cinquina et al., 2004a), capillary electrophoresis (Zhang
and Sun, 2004), paper electrophoresis (Sato et al., 2002, 2006),
TLC (Bajc and Gacnik, 2009), and gas chromatography-mass spec-
trometry (Marks and Anderson, 2006). In addition, there is a need
for methods well suited to high-speed screening. The most rapid
method for detecting histamine is based on ﬂow injection analy-
sis (FIA) and is capable of screening 60 sample extracts/hour
(Hungerford et al., 1990). Enzymatic methods are attractive for
their selectivity and ﬂow injection has been used in combina-
tion with enzyme electrodes for easy automation (Watanabe et al.,
2007). Many other commercial test kits are available, based on
selective antibodies (Lehane and Olley, 2000; Köse et al., 2009).
Commercial test kits based on immunoassay methods for hista-
mine analyses became popular because of their user friendliness
and reduced time requirements compared to those of traditional
analytical techniques. Recently many authors (Köse et al., 2011;
Tahmouzi et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2011; Hungerford and Wu, 2012)
report different methods for rapid determination of histamine in
ﬁsh.

CONTROL MEASURES
The FDA has issued industry guidelines aiming at establishing pro-
cedures for the safe processing and importing of ﬁsh and ﬁshery
products based on the hazard analysis and critical control points
(HACCP) approach (FDA, 2011). According to the most recent
HACCP guidelines for the control of histamine production, a core
temperature of 4.4˚C or less should be achieved and maintained
throughout handling, processing, and distribution of potentially
hazardous ﬁsh. The primary goal of these guidelines is the growth
inhibition of spoilage bacteria capable of producing histamine
through proper handling and chilling of ﬁsh (FDA, 2011). In order
to achieve this objective, all boats should ice ﬁsh immediately after
landing aboard the vessel so that the temperature at sites of micro-
biological concern is reduced at levels capable of controlling the
growth of histamine-producing bacteria. Moreover, an ice-plant

Biogenic amines in ﬁsh

could be built and ice made available at reasonable cost. Other
spaces could also be modiﬁed so that the boats could be capable of
carrying up to 100 kg of ice (FAO, 2004). It must be highlighted,
however, that the time required to lower the internal temperature
of ﬁsh after capture depends on a number of factors, including:
(i) the harvest method; (ii) the size of the ﬁsh; (iii) the chill-
ing method. Once chilled, the scombrotoxin-forming ﬁsh should
be maintained as close as possible to the freezing point (or held
frozen) until it is consumed (FDA, 2011).

At the processing plant, ﬁsh is gilled and gutted, then stored
in ice until packed for air transport to the consumer country.
Histamine decarboxylase activity could lead to a 10-fold increase
in histamine during processing, air freight and marketing. The
preventive measures for this step include controlling refrigeration
temperature in the plant or performing proper icing during stor-
age of raw material, in-process product as well as ﬁnished product
(FAO, 2004). During processing of ﬁsh (butchering, cleaning,
brining, salting, smoking, drying, fermenting, pickling, mixing,
stufﬁng, packing, labeling, and staging), it is recommended that
it is not exposed to ambient temperatures above 4.4˚C for more
than 12 h cumulatively, if it has been previously frozen or heat-
processed sufﬁciently to destroy histamine-forming bacteria, or for
more than 4 h in the other case (FDA, 2011). Given the heat-stable
nature of histamine, the intended use of the product is not likely to
affect the signiﬁcance of this hazard. Recontamination of seafood
with enzyme-forming bacteria in conjunction with temperature
abuse may also allow for histamine formation following cooking.
Thus, a conscientious sanitation program during seafood process-
ing is of vital importance in order for recontamination events to
be avoided.

Many recent studies proposed a new approach based on the
employment of microorganisms or substances (additives, spices,
disinfectants) able to inhibit histamine-forming bacteria. Mah
and Hwang (2009a) studied the effects of food additives on
BAs-producing strains of Bacillus licheniformis isolated from
Myeolchi-jeot, with the greatest inhibitory effect being observed
for glycine. The same product (Myeolchi-jeot) was ripened with
the addition of a starter culture of Staphylococcus xylosus, which

was shown to be capable of degrading histamine and tyramine
(Mah and Hwang, 2009b), while the use of spices, in particular
garlic, also showed an inhibitory effect (Mah et al., 2009). The
development of post-harvest treatments for reducing histamine-
forming bacteria in ﬁsh upon harvest is an important intervention
strategy to prevent histamine formation in ﬁsh and control scom-
broid poisoning. Phuvasate and Su (2010) investigated the efﬁcacy
of treatments with electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water and EO ice,
containing 100 ppm chlorine. According to these researchers, soak-
ing of ﬁsh (salmon) in EO water reduced Enterobacter aerogenes
and Morganella morganii by 1.3 and 2.2 log CFU/cm2 respec-
tively, while soaking yellowﬁn tuna in EO ice reduced the same
microorganisms by 2.4 and 3.5 log CFU/cm2, respectively. More-
over, emerging methods potentially applied as control measures
include the addition of starter cultures that degrade histamine,
the application of hydrostatic pressure, irradiation, and packaging
(Naila et al., 2010).

CONCLUSION
Seafood is susceptible to contamination by BAs-producing
microorganisms at different points of the food chain. High levels
of BAs can be prevented through the application of good hygiene
practices and proper temperatures during handling, delivery and
storage. Although BAs formation is the result of bacterial growth,
the presence of these undesirable compounds, especially hista-
mine, is not always noticed by consumers. In fact, while a ﬁsh
with obvious spoilage will most likely not be consumed, a ﬁsh
with a good appearance and no detectable spoilage odors may
be consumed even if it contains a high histamine level. Thus,
the application of appropriate control measures is fundamental
for assuring seafood safety and such a responsibility is shared
among the seafood catchers, processors, distributors, retailers, and
merchants.
