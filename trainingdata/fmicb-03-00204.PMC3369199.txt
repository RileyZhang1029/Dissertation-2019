In addition to control by major nutrient elements (nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon) the
productivity and species composition of marine phytoplankton communities are also reg-
ulated by a number of trace metal nutrients (iron, zinc, cobalt, manganese, copper, and
cadmium). Of these, iron is most limiting to phytoplankton growth and has the greatest
effect on algal species diversity. It also plays an important role in limiting di-nitrogen (N2) ﬁx-
ation rates, and thus is important in controlling ocean inventories of ﬁxed nitrogen. Because
of these effects, iron is thought to play a key role in regulating biological cycles of carbon
and nitrogen in the ocean, including the biological transfer of carbon to the deep sea,
the so-called biological CO2 pump, which helps regulate atmospheric CO2 and CO2-linked
global warming. Other trace metal nutrients (zinc, cobalt, copper, and manganese) have
lesser effects on productivity; but may exert an important inﬂuence on the species com-
position of algal communities because of large differences in metal requirements among
species.The interactions between trace metals and ocean plankton are reciprocal: not only
do the metals control the plankton, but the plankton regulate the distributions, chemical
speciation, and cycling of these metals through cellular uptake and recycling processes,
downward ﬂux of biogenic particles, biological release of organic chelators, and mediation
of redox reactions. This two way interaction has inﬂuenced not only the biology and chem-
istry of the modern ocean, but has had a profound inﬂuence on biogeochemistry of the
ocean and earth system as a whole, and on the evolution of marine and terrestrial biology
over geologic history.

INTRODUCTION
Life in the ocean is dependent on ﬁxation of carbon (C) and nitro-
gen (N) by planktonic microalgae, ranging in diameter from <1
to >100 μm. These “phytoplankton” consist of eukaryotic algae,
which photosynthetically ﬁx carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic
matter, and cyanobacteria that ﬁx CO2 and also ﬁx di-nitrogen
(N2) to form ammonium. They make up less than 1% of the plant
biomass on earth, but account for almost 50% of global primary
production (Field et al., 1998) and are a major source of trace gases
such as dimethylsulﬁde that inﬂuence climate (Charlson et al.,
1987; Andreae and Crutzen, 1997). Up until the ground breaking
experiments of John Martin (Martin and Fitzwater, 1988; Martin
et al., 1991), the growth of marine phytoplankton was thought
to be primarily limited by the availability of the major nutrient
nitrogen and to a lesser extent phosphorus. However, numerous
iron-addition experiments in bottles and in mesoscale patches of
surface seawater in the ensuing decades have demonstrated that
the trace metal nutrient iron limits the growth of phytoplank-
ton and regulates their species composition in 30–40% of the
world ocean, especially in high nitrate-low chlorophyll (HNLC)
regions: the Southern Ocean, the equatorial and subarctic Paciﬁc,
and some coastal upwelling systems (Hutchins et al., 2002; Moore
et al., 2002, 2004; Coale et al., 2004; Boyd et al., 2007). In addition,
there is substantial evidence that iron limits the ﬁxation of N2 by

cyanobacteria in the ocean, and thus, controls oceanic inventories
of biologically available ﬁxed nitrogen (Rueter, 1983; Falkowski,
1997; Wu et al., 2000; Sohm et al., 2011). Several other trace metal
nutrients (zinc, cobalt, manganese, and copper) have also been
shown to stimulate phytoplankton growth in bottle incubation
experiments with natural ocean water, but their effects are usu-
ally less substantial than those for iron (Coale, 1991; Crawford
et al., 2003; Franck et al., 2003; Saito et al., 2005). However, these
metals may play important roles in regulating the species compo-
sition of phytoplankton communities because of large differences
in cellular trace metal concentrations and growth requirements
among species (Brand et al., 1983; Sunda and Huntsman, 1995a,b;
Crawford et al., 2003; Ho et al., 2003).

In this review, I will discuss interactions between trace metal
nutrients [iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), cop-
per (Cu), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and molybdenum (Mo)] and
phytoplankton in the ocean. These interactions involve not only
the effect of the metals on the growth and species composition
of phytoplankton communities, but also the profound effect of
marine plankton on the distribution, speciation chemistry, and
biological availability of these nutrient metals (Figure 1). There
are many aspects to consider in these interactions, including (1) the
distribution of metal nutrients in the ocean on various temporal
and spatial scales; (2) the sources, sinks, and cycling of metals; (3)

the river-derived particulate Fe via reduction to soluble Fe(II), and
thereby provide an important Fe source to the ocean (Moore and
Braucher, 2008). Another equally if not more important source of
iron to the ocean is aeolian deposition of iron-containing mineral
dust transported by the wind from arid regions (Duce and Tindale,
1991; Jickells et al., 2005). These aeolian inputs change seasonally
with variations in rainfall and prevailing winds and are highest in
waters downwind of deserts (Measures and Vink, 1999; Jickells and
Spokes, 2001). Regions far removed from aeolian and sedimentary
continental sources, such as the South Paciﬁc and Southern Ocean
receive low external iron inputs and are among the most iron-
limited areas of the oceans (Martin et al., 1990; Behrenfeld and
Kolber, 1999; Coale et al., 2004). Other external sources such as
glaciers/iceberg melt, seasonal sea ice melting, island wakes, vol-
canism, and hydrothermal activity can provide important local
inputs of iron and other metals (Boyd and Ellwood, 2010).

Because of the much lower trace metal concentrations in the
open ocean relative to those in coastal waters, oceanic algal species
have evolved the ability to grow at much lower external and intra-
cellular concentrations of Fe, Zn, and Mn (Brand et al., 1983;
Brand, 1991; Sunda and Huntsman, 1986, 1992, 1995a,b). In doing
so they have been forced to rearrange their metabolic architecture
(e.g., by decreasing the abundance of iron-rich protein complexes
[photosystem I and the cytochrome b6/f complex] in photosyn-
thesis; Strzepek and Harrison, 2004), by switching from iron-
containing enzymes to less carbon-efﬁcient metal free enzymes
(the replacement of ferredoxin by ﬂavodoxin in photosynthetic
electron transport (La Roche et al., 1996) and N2-ﬁxation (Saito
et al., 2011), or by switching from scarce metals to more-abundant
ones in some critical metalloenzymes [e.g., the replacement of
cytochrome c 6 which contains iron with the copper protein plas-
tocyanin in photosynthetic electron transport (Peers and Price,
2006)].

Residence times of trace metal nutrients in the ocean vary over
a wide range – from 20 to 40 years for Mn (Landing and Bruland,
1987; Bruland et al., 1994) to ∼800,000 years for Mo (Emerson
and Huested, 1991; Morford and Emerson, 1999). Concentrations
of Zn, Cd, Ni, and Cu, which have intermediate to long residence
times (3000–100,000 years; Bruland and Lohan, 2003) relative to
the average ventilation time of ocean water (∼1000 years for deep
ocean water), increase with depth, similar to increases observed for
major nutrients (nitrate, phosphate, and silicic acid; Figures 2 and
3). In the northeast Paciﬁc, ﬁlterable concentrations of Zn and Cd
increase by 80-fold and 400-fold, respectively, between the surface
and 1000 m (Bruland, 1980). The similarity between vertical pro-
ﬁles of trace metal nutrients and those of major nutrients suggest
that both sets of nutrients undergo similar biological uptake and
regeneration processes in which each is taken up by phytoplankton
in sunlit surface waters and are thereby efﬁciently removed from
solution. Much of these assimilated metals and major nutrients
are recycled within the euphotic zone by the coupled processes of
zooplankton grazing and excretion, viral lysis of cells, and bacterial
degradation of organic materials (Hutchins et al., 1993; Hutchins
and Bruland, 1994; Poorvin et al., 2004; Strzepek et al., 2005; Boyd
and Ellwood, 2010). However, a portion of the assimilated metals
and major nutrients is continuously lost from the euphotic zone
by vertical settling of biogenic particulate matter, including intact

trace metal nutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, Co, Cu, Mo, and Cd) and
phytoplankton in the sea. In these interactions the chemistry of trace
metal nutrients (their concentrations, chemical speciation, and redox
cycling) regulate the productivity, species composition, and trophic
interactions of marine phytoplankton communities. These communities in
turn regulate the chemistry and cycling of the trace metals through cellular
uptake and assimilation, vertical transport of biogenic particles (intact cells
and fecal pellets), mediation of metal regeneration processes (by grazers,
bacteria, and viruses), production of organic chelators, and biological
mediation of metal redox cycling.

of biological organization (molecular, cellular, population, com-
munity, ecosystem, ocean/earth system), and (5) the inﬂuence of
phytoplankton and the planktonic community as a whole on the
chemistry and cycling of metal nutrients in the ocean.

METAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE OCEAN
The distribution patterns of trace metal nutrients in the ocean
have a profound inﬂuence on phytoplankton communities. Con-
centrations of ﬁlterable Fe and Zn (that which passes through a
0.2 or 0.4 μm-pore ﬁlter) are often extremely low (0.02–0.1 nM)
in surface open ocean waters (Bruland, 1980; Martin et al., 1989;
Johnson et al., 1997). Filterable concentrations of Cd, a nutrient
analog for Zn, can reach values as low as 0.002–0.004 nM in sur-
face waters of the North Paciﬁc and Atlantic Oceans (Bruland,
1980; Bruland and Franks, 1983; Table 1). Filterable levels of these
and other trace metal nutrients can increase by orders of mag-
nitude in surface transects from the open ocean to coastal and
estuarine waters owing to metal inputs from continental sources:
rivers, ground water, aeolian dust, and coastal sediments (Bru-
land and Franks, 1983; Sunda, 1988/89). Filterable Fe can reach
micromolar levels in estuaries and 10–20 μM in high humic rivers,
1000 to 10,000-fold higher than concentrations in surface ocean
waters. Filterable iron in rivers occurs largely as colloidal particles
(0.02–0.4 μm diameter), which are rapidly lost from estuarine and
coastal waters via salt-induced coagulation and particulate settling
(Boyle et al., 1977). Because of this efﬁcient removal, much of the
iron in rivers is deposited in estuarine and coastal sediments, and
little directly reaches the open sea. However, reducing conditions in
organic-rich shelf and margin sediments can re-mobilize some of

Dupont, 2007).

algal cells, zooplankton fecal pellets, and organic detritus. The
macro- and micro-nutrients contained in these settling biogenic
particles are then returned to solution in non-lit deeper waters by
bacterial degradation processes, with the rate of this regeneration
decreasing exponentially with water depth. Over time the uptake,
settling, and regeneration processes deplete trace metal and major
nutrients in sunlit surface waters to low levels and increase con-
centrations at depth at elemental ratios equal to average values in
phytoplankton. This set of processes also transfers CO2 to the deep
sea and is important in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentra-
tions (Sigman and Boyle, 2000). The cycle is completed when the
nutrient and CO2 reservoirs in deeper waters are returned to the
surface via vertical mixing and advection (upwelling) processes.

Based on the above dynamics, the plots of trace metal nutrients
with longer residence times (Cu, Zn, Ni, and Cd) vs those of major
nutrients (e.g., phosphate) should have slopes equal the average
ratios of trace metals to major nutrients in marine plankton. Such
behavior was previously demonstrated for depth dependent plots
of nitrate vs phosphate concentrations in which the slope of these
−1) equaled the average N:P measured
relationships (16 mol mol
in ocean plankton (Redﬁeld et al., 1963). Similar behavior has been
observed for plots of Zn, Cd, Ni, and Cu vs phosphate, but with
several caveats (Martin et al., 1976; Sunda and Huntsman, 1992,
1995c, 2000; Croot et al., 2011; Figure 4). In depth proﬁles for
the northeastern Paciﬁc (Figure 2), the concentrations of three of
the metals (Ni, Cu, Cd) within the nutricline are linearly related
to those of phosphate, and for Cu and Cd, the metal:P slopes
(or equivalent metal:C ratios) agree well with values measured in
net plankton samples or in algae cultured at the concentration of
unchelated metal [M
] (or other controlling metals in the case of
Cd) observed in the sunlit surface layer (Figures 4B,C; Table 2).
However, unlike N vs P plots, these relationships have positive

(cid:2)

y-intercepts for Cu and Ni, indicating that these metals are not
completely “used up” biologically in N- and P-depleted surface
waters. By contrast, the Zn:P relationship exhibits increasing slopes
with increasing Zn concentrations and a negative y-intercept for
a linear regression of Zn vs P (Figure 4A; Table 2). Here the
Zn:P slope (and associated Zn:C molar ratio) in the productive
surface layer (0–185 m) agrees with Zn:P and Zn:C values for
(cid:2)
marine algae grown at the measured [Zn
] range within the sur-
face layer (Tables 1 and 2; Figure 5) and the Zn:C ratio (3.7 μmol
−1) in phytoplankton growing in near-surface seawater in the
mol
northeast Paciﬁc (Lohan et al., 2005). However at greater depths
(185–800 m), the Zn:P slope and associated Zn:C ratio (22 μmol
−1) is similar to average values for phytoplankton growing
mol
(cid:2)
at the much higher [Zn
] range observed at depth (Sunda and
Huntsman, 1992; Table 2; Figure 5).

The non-linearity of the Zn vs P plots likely reﬂects the very
(cid:2)
large variation in [Zn
] in ocean waters and the associated variation
in Zn:P and Zn:C ratios in phytoplankton growing in these waters
(cid:2)
(Sunda and Huntsman, 1992). Although waters with high [Zn
] are
usually found below the photic zone, and thus, cannot inﬂuence
the removal of metals by algal growth and uptake, thermoha-
line and wind-driven upwelling can bring these high-nutrient,
high-zinc waters to the surface, especially in polar regions. As a
consequence of these processes, ﬁlterable Zn in surface waters of
the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean increased from 0.5 nM
at a latitude of 46˚S to 4.5 nM at 66˚S along with increases in phos-
phate and nitrate (Croot et al., 2011). The [Zn
] in surface waters
increased to as high 1.8 nM, as the zinc concentration exceeded
that of strong Zn binding ligands (Baars and Croot, 2011), a value
(cid:2)
∼400-fold higher than mean surface [Zn
] in the North Paciﬁc
(Table 1). Subsequently, the lateral changes in nutrient and metal
concentrations in these near-surface waters caused by algal uptake,

samples.

biogenic particulate settling, and net regeneration in deeper waters
are transposed to deeper depths and more northern latitudes with
downwelling and lateral advection, which is most intense during
winter (Redﬁeld et al., 1963). In this way near-surface processes
of algal uptake, settling, and shallow water regeneration can inﬂu-
ence the composition and vertical structure of major and trace
metal nutrients in deep ocean waters worldwide. Indeed, at depths
at and just above the phosphate maximum in the Atlantic Ocean
(600–800 m; see Figures 2B and 3A), about half of the phosphate
occurs as “preformed phosphate,” which was present when the
water originally subducted from the surface to form the Antarctic
Intermediate water layer, while the remainder occurs as regener-
ated phosphate (Redﬁeld et al., 1963). Likewise, only a portion of
the trace metal nutrients at depth are likely derived from regenera-
tion of settling biogenic particles, while the remainder must occur
as “preformed metal nutrients.”

The deep water concentrations of both major nutrient elements
(N, P, and Si) and many longer-lived metal micro-nutrients (Zn,
Cd, Ni, and Cu) are two- to ﬁvefold higher in deep waters of the

North Paciﬁc than the North Atlantic (Figures 2 and 3) because
of large scale differences in the thermohaline circulation patterns
between the Atlantic and Paciﬁc oceans. In the Paciﬁc the major
water inﬂow occurs at depth where concentrations of nutrients
and longer-lived nutrient metals are high (Broecker, 1991). Con-
sequently, the Paciﬁc acts as a nutrient trap and concentrates high
levels of nutrients and longer-lived nutrient metals in its deeper
waters (Broecker, 1991). The Atlantic, by contrast, has the oppo-
site circulation pattern, with its major inﬂow at the surface where
nutrients and metals are depleted, and its major outﬂow at depth,
the North Atlantic Deep water. As might be expected, this circu-
lation pattern tends to lower deep water concentrations of major
nutrients and longer-lived nutrient metals.

Two trace metal nutrients with short ocean residence times (Mn
and Co), show the opposite pattern to Cu, Zn, Cd, and Ni, and
have highest concentrations at or near the surface and lower deep
water concentrations in North Paciﬁc than in the North Atlantic
(Figures 2H and 3D; Landing and Bruland, 1987; Jickells and
Burton, 1988; Martin et al., 1989). The short residence times and

Ocean (Ocean Station Papa, 50.0˚N, 145.0˚W, August 1987; Martin et al., 1989) and the Northeast Atlantic (40˚N, 20˚W, May 1989; Martin et al., 1993).

low concentrations in the older deep waters of the North Paciﬁc
are due to bacterially catalyzed oxidation of soluble Mn(II) and
Co(II) to insoluble Mn(III and IV) and Co(III) oxides, and subse-
quent removal via particulate aggregation and settling as the water
advects along its ﬂow path. Likewise, iron is scavenged from deep
ocean waters by oxide formation and adsorption onto particles,
but it is also avidly taken up by phytoplankton in surface waters. It
has moderately short residence times (∼70–200 years) and shows
similar deepwater concentrations in the North Atlantic and Paciﬁc
(Johnson et al., 1997; Figure 3B). It exhibits surface depletion
and increasing concentrations with depth in iron-limited regions
such as the subarctic Paciﬁc and northeast Atlantic during spring
(Figure 3B), but can show pronounced surface maxima in strat-
iﬁed ocean waters receiving high aeolian inputs (Bruland et al.,
1994; Measures and Vink, 1999).

In contrast to the other nutrient metals, Mo occurs at essen-
tially the same concentration (100–110 nM) independent of depth
or ocean basin (Collier, 1985). Its concentration is roughly propor-
tional to salinity and its lack of depletion in surface waters indicates
minimal removal of Mo by marine plankton relative to its seawater
concentration, which is orders of magnitude higher than surface
levels of other trace metal nutrients (Figures 1 and 2).

COMPLEXATION AND REDOX CHEMISTRY
Trace metal nutrients in the ocean exist as a variety of different
chemical species and forms, which strongly inﬂuences their bio-
logical uptake and biogeochemical cycling. All but Mo occur as
cationic metal ions that are complexed to varying degrees by inor-
ganic and organic ligands or are adsorbed onto or bound within
various abiotic and biotic particles. Many of these metals (Fe, Cu,
Mn, and Co) occur in different oxidation states, which have dif-
ferent solubilities, binding strengths with organic ligands, ligand
exchange kinetics, and biological availabilities. Consequently, the
redox chemistry of these metals has a major inﬂuence on their
chemical behavior, biological uptake, and biogeochemical cycling.

Ni, Zn, and Cd exist in oxygenated seawater as soluble diva-
lent cations that are complexed to varying degrees by inorganic
ligands (Cl
3 ; Byrne et al., 1988) and organic
chelators. Only a small percentage of Ni is complexed by organic
ligands (0–30%; Saito et al., 2004), while ∼97% of the ﬁlterable
zinc (Bruland, 1989) and ∼63% of ﬁlterable cadmium (Bruland,
1992) is chelated in North Paciﬁc surface waters by unidentiﬁed
strong organic ligands present at low concentrations (Table 1).
Similar strong chelation of Zn has been observed in the North
Atlantic and in subantarctic waters (Ellwood and van den Berg,
2000; Ellwood, 2004). Based on Zn concentrations in ﬁltered sur-
face waters from the North Paciﬁc (0.06–0.9 nM; Bruland, 1980)
and organic complexation data (Bruland, 1989), the concentration
of biologically available dissolved inorganic zinc species (Zn
) can
be as low as 1–2 pM in surface ocean water, low enough to limit
the growth of at least some algal species (Sunda and Huntsman,
1992, 1995a). However, in deep ocean waters (Bruland, 1989), and
upwelled surface waters in the Southern Ocean (Baars and Croot,
2011), Zn concentrations exceed the concentration of strong Zn
(cid:2)
binding ligands, resulting in up to 1000-fold increases in Zn
levels
(Table 1).

Manganese exists in seawater in three oxidation states: Mn(II),
Mn(III), and Mn(IV). Insoluble Mn(III) and Mn(IV) oxides are
the stable redox forms of this metal in oxygenated seawater,
although Mn(III) also occurs as soluble chelates with organic
ligands in some environments (e.g., hypoxic waters; Trouwborst
et al., 2006). These oxides can be reduced chemically and pho-
tochemically to dissolved Mn(II), which is highly soluble and is
not bound appreciably by organic ligands (Sunda and Huntsman,
1994). Although Mn(II) is unstable with respect to oxidation by
molecular oxygen (O2), the chemical kinetics of this reaction are
exceedingly slow in seawater (with a half life of 500 years at pH 8.1),
allowing Mn(II) to persist despite its thermodynamic instability
(Morgan, 1967). Enzymes present within the outer polysaccharide
sheath of certain bacteria, catalyze Mn(II) oxidation to Mn(IV)

bacterial formation of Mn oxides, and their subsequent removal
via particle settling results in short residence times and low-Mn
concentrations in deep ocean waters as noted earlier (Figure 2H).
In the ocean’s surface mixed layer, oxidation is greatly diminished
owing to photo-inhibition of the Mn-oxidizing bacteria while
Mn oxides are dissolved by photo-reduction to Mn(II; Sunda
and Huntsman, 1988, 1994; Moffett, 1990). In the southwestern
Sargasso Sea, Mn oxidation rates increased from undetectable lev-
−1 at
els (<0.2% day
160 m just below the chlorophyll maximum (Sunda and Hunts-
man, 1988). By contrast, estimated rates of Mn oxide reductive
−1 over this same
dissolution decreased from ∼70% to 8.5% day
depth interval. The combination of decreased Mn(II) oxidation
rates and increased rates of Mn oxide reductive dissolution caused
a large decrease in Mn oxide concentration between 160 m and the
surface and a concomitant four- to ﬁvefold increase in dissolved
Mn(II). Similar high concentrations of dissolved Mn(II) in surface
seawater are widespread in the ocean (Figure 2H), enhancing the
supply of Mn needed to support algal photosynthesis (Sunda and
Huntsman, 1988).

The chemical behavior of iron, biologically the most important
trace metal nutrient, is arguably the most complex. In oxygenated
seawater its stable oxidation state Fe(III) forms sparingly soluble
iron hydroxide and oxide precipitates, whose solubility, lability,
and biological availability decreases with oxide aging (Wells et al.,
1991; Kuma et al., 1996; Lui and Millero, 2002; Yoshida et al.,
2006). This oxide formation and the tendency of ferric ions to
adsorb onto particle surfaces results in low deep ocean concentra-
tions (0.4–0.8 nM; Johnson et al., 1997; Boyd and Ellwood, 2010)
despite iron’s high crustal abundance (it is the fourth most abun-
dant element by weight). Most (>99.9%) of the ﬁlterable Fe(III)
in seawater is strongly bound to complex mixtures of organic lig-
ands (Gledhill and van den Berg, 1994; Rue and Bruland, 1995;
Buck and Bruland, 2007; Gledhill and Buck, 2012). This organic
complexation minimizes iron adsorption and precipitation, and
thus reduces iron removal from seawater by particulate scaveng-
ing processes (Johnson et al., 1997). Titrations utilizing ligand
competition/cathodic stripping voltammetry reveal two classes of
iron chelating ligands in near-surface seawater, a high-afﬁnity class
(L1) and lower afﬁnity class (L2), with most of the ﬁlterable iron
bound to the L1 class (Rue and Bruland, 1995; Cullen et al., 2006;
Table 1). However in deeper water (≥500 m) only L1 class lig-

ands are detected (Table 1), suggesting that they are produced by
biological processes in the productive surface layers of the ocean.
The two ligand classes and their iron chelates exist in both solu-
ble (i.e., dissolved) and colloidal (0.02–0.4 μm size range) phases,
with most of the ligands present in the soluble phase and some of
the colloidal iron being inert to ligand exchange (Wu et al., 2001;
Cullen et al., 2006).

The identity of the two ligand classes is yet to be determined
(Vraspir and Butler, 2009; Gledhill and Buck, 2012). Many of
the high-afﬁnity ligands may be bacterial siderophores, strong
ferric chelators produced by bacteria to solubilize iron and facil-
itate its intracellular uptake (Macrellis et al., 2001). Individual
siderophores, largely in the hydroymate class, have been identi-
ﬁed in ocean waters, but their concentrations account for only a
few percent of the strong iron-binding ligands (Mawji et al., 2008,

polysaccharides (Hassler et al., 2011a,b), and secreted chelating
compounds such as domoic acid (Rue and Bruland, 2001).

Ferric iron can be reduced in seawater to highly soluble Fe(II)
(ferrous iron) by several processes, including, biological reduc-
tion at cell surfaces (Maldonado and Price, 2001; Shaked et al.,
2005), direct photolysis of ferric chelates (Kuma et al., 1992; Bar-
beau et al., 2001; Barbeau, 2006), reduction by photochemically
−
or biologically produced superoxide radicals (O
2 ; Voelker and
Sedlak, 1995; Rose et al., 2005; Kustka et al., 2005), or reduc-
tion within O2 depleted zones in organic particles or aggregates
(Balzano et al., 2009). As a result up to 64% of the ﬁlterable iron
in near-surface seawater occurs as Fe(II), with the highest per-
centage observed during daytime near the surface, suggesting a
largely photochemical or algal source (Waite et al., 1995; Croot
et al., 2008; Roy et al., 2008; Shaked, 2008; Sarthou et al., 2011).
Because Fe(II) binds much more weakly to organic ligands than
Fe(III) and because direct photolysis of ferric chelates involves
oxidation and degradation of the ligand, the photo-reduction or
biological reduction of chelated-Fe(III) often results in dissoci-
ation of Fe(II) from the chelate (Barbeau, 2006; Figure 6). The
resulting soluble Fe(II) is unstable in the presence of O2, and
(cid:2)
is re-oxidized to dissolved Fe(III) hydrolysis species [Fe(III
)’],
which are then re-chelated by organic ligands (Sunda, 2001).
Because Fe(II)
are continuously produced during
redox cycling, elevated steady state concentrations of each are
often established (Sunda and Huntsman, 2003), with Fe(II) res-
idence times that increase with decreasing temperature, pH, and
concentrations of oxidants (primarily O2; Santana-Casiano et al.,
2005). In air-equilibrated seawater at pH 8.0, computed resi-
dence times for Fe(II)
range from 3.2 h at 0˚C to 2.2 min at
30˚C (Santana-Casiano et al., 2005). There is evidence for Fe(II)
chelation by unidentiﬁed organic ligands, which retards oxidation
rates in some regions (Croot et al., 2008; Roy et al., 2008) and
increases them in others (Roy and Wells, 2011), apparently linked
to differences in the chemical nature of the complexing ligands.
The nature and degree of organic complexation of Fe(II) needs
to be quantiﬁed as it not only affects redox cycling of iron, but
may also inﬂuence iron uptake by phytoplankton (Shaked and Lis,
2012).

range for ocean water is shown based on data of Bruland (1989) (Table 1).

2011; Velasquez et al., 2011). The low measured abundance of
identiﬁable siderophores, however, may largely reﬂect our inabil-
ity to quantitatively isolate other more-abundant classes of marine
siderophores (e.g., catecholates and carboxylates) or reﬂect the
presence of a large number of yet to be identiﬁed siderophores
released by marine bacteria (Velasquez et al., 2011; Gledhill and
Buck, 2012). There is also evidence that humic substances com-
prise at least some of the iron-binding ligands in coastal and deep
ocean water and that many of these ligands may be derived from
rivers and sedimentary sources (Laglera and van den Berg, 2009;
Laglera et al., 2011). Other iron ligands with weak to moder-
ate binding strengths are released from biological sources (e.g.,
grazing, viral lysis, and algal or bacterial secretion) and include

concentrations (2–6 nM in open ocean waters), which decreases
concentrations to very low levels (0.001–10 pM; Coale and
Cu(II)
Bruland, 1990; Moffett, 1995; Moffett and Dupont, 2007; Buck
et al., 2010; Table 1). Different electrochemical methods show
consistent strong chelation of Cu in surface waters; however, in the
deeper waters of the North Paciﬁc (>200 m) the results diverge,
with differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry showing a
complete loss of the strong L1 ligand class at depths below 200 m,
while ligand competition/cathodic stripping voltammetry shows
continued strong complexation of copper by this ligand class down
to at least 2500 m (Coale and Bruland, 1988, 1990; Moffett and
Dupont, 2007). The reasons for these analytical differences are not
known, but may be related to a change in the nature of the ligands
and possibly the oxidation state of the bound copper between the
surface and deeper waters (Moffett and Dupont, 2007).

Cu(II) can be reduced to Cu(I) by photochemical processes
(Moffett and Zika, 1988), reduction at cell surfaces (Jones et al.,
1987) or by reaction with chemical reducing agents, such as sulfur
containing organic ligands (Leal and van den Berg, 1998). In sur-
face waters, the resulting Cu(I) is re-oxidized by reaction with O2
on time scales of minutes and steady state Cu(I) concentrations
can comprise 5–10% of the ﬁlterable copper (Moffett and Zika,
1988; Sharma and Millero, 1988). However, the effect of this redox
cycling on the biological availability of copper is not known.

The chemistry of cobalt is also highly complex. Cobalt exists
in seawater as soluble Co(II) or as Co(III), which forms insol-
uble oxides at the pH of seawater. The formation of these oxides
appears to be microbially mediated and may be largely responsible
for the removal of this metal from deep ocean waters (Tebo et al.,
1984; Moffett and Ho, 1996; Figure 3D). Much of the ﬁlterable
Co in seawater (up to100%) is strongly bound to organic ligands
(Ellwood and van den Berg, 2001; Saito and Moffett, 2001; Saito
et al., 2005). The conditional stability constant(s) for the Co com-
plexes is extremely high (1015.6 to ≥1016.8 M–1), consistent with
Co binding as kinetically inert Co(III) chelates (Saito et al., 2005).

CELLULAR UPTAKE PROCESSES
Trace metal nutrients, like major nutrients, are taken up intra-
cellularly by specialized transport proteins on the cytoplasmic
membrane of algal cells. Consequently, uptake rates generally
follow Michaelis Menten enzyme kinetics

Uptake rate = Vmax[M]
(Ks + [M])

as observed for Mn, Fe, Zn, and Cu (Sunda and Huntsman, 1986,
1998a; Hudson and Morel, 1990; Lane et al., 2008; Guo et al.,
2010). In Eq. 1 V max is the maximum uptake rate, [M] is the con-
centration of chemical species that react with receptor sites on the
transport protein (and thus are bioavailable by deﬁnition), and K s
is the [M] at which half of the transport sites are bound to the
nutrient metal and the uptake rate is half of V max. Virtually all
of these proteins act as pumps and require energy for intracellu-
lar transport. With some exceptions, the binding of metals to the
receptor sites on these proteins is determined by the concentra-
tion of free aquated metal ions or in many cases, the concentration
of kinetically labile dissolved inorganic species, M
(aquated metal

FIGURE 6 | Photo-redox cycling of ferric chelates (Fe(III)L), such as
photoactive siderophore complexes. The cycle is initiated by the
absorption of light by the ferric chelate and a subsequent photolytic reaction
in which the iron is reduced to Fe(II) and the ligand is oxidized. The Fe(II)
dissociates from the degraded chelate to give dissolved inorganic ferrous
species (Fe(II)(cid:2)) which are then rapidly oxidized to dissolved inorganic ferric
hydrolysis species (Fe(III)(cid:2)) by molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The
Fe(III)’ is then re-chelated by the ligand to reform the ferric chelate. The
cycle increases the uptake rate of iron by algal cells by increasing the
steady state concentrations of biologically available Fe(II)(cid:2) and Fe(III)(cid:2). The
transport system T directly accesses Fe(II)(cid:2) and indirectly accesses Fe(III)(cid:2)
by reduction to Fe(II)(cid:2). Once inside the cell, much of the iron is used for
synthesis of cytochromes (Cyt) and Fe-S redox centers, needed in high
amounts in photosynthesis.

and Fe(III)

Thus, iron undergoes a dynamic redox cycling in surface sea-
water, which can greatly enhance its biological availability to
phytoplankton by increasing concentrations of highly available
dissolved inorganic Fe(II)
species (Anderson and
Morel, 1982; Sunda, 2001; Maldonado et al., 2005; Fan, 2008;
Figure 6). The photochemical enhancement of iron uptake by
phytoplankton increases with decreasing temperature because the
photolysis of Fe(III) chelates should be largely insensitive to tem-
perature while the oxidation rates of photochemically produced
(cid:2)
Fe(II) to dissolved Fe(III)
slows as does the re-chelation of Fe(III)
by organic ligands (Sunda and Huntsman, 2011; Figure 6). These
slower reoxidation and re-chelation rates at lower temperatures
increases the steady state concentrations of the highly biologically
available Fe(II)
species in the presence of sunlight,
as shown for ferric complexes with the synthetic chelator EDTA
(Sunda and Huntsman, 2003, 2011). This enhanced photochemi-
cal effect should increase the availability of iron to phytoplankton
in iron-limited polar regions such as the Southern Ocean, and
without this effect, these regions might experience even more
severe iron limitation.

Other micronutrient metals such as Cu and Co also exist in
different oxidation states and are heavily chelated by organic
ligands. Copper can exist in seawater as thermodynamically sta-
ble Cu(II), or as instable Cu(I) (Moffett and Zika, 1988). Most

Although Eq. 1 is relatively simple, its application is not entirely
straight forward. One complicating factor is that the relevant
substrate concentration, [M], is that at the surface of the cell mem-
brane, which can be much less than that in bulk seawater in cases
where the uptake rate approaches the maximum rate of diffusive
ﬂux of available metal species to the cell surface (Hudson and
Morel, 1993). This indeed occurs for uptake of Zn and Co(II)
by small diatoms and coccolithophores (3.5–6 μm diameter) at
(cid:2)
low Zn
concentrations (Sunda and Huntsman, 1995a;
Figure 7). Since diffusive ﬂux per unit of cell biovolume varies
with the inverse square the cell diameter, diffusion limitation of
uptake intensiﬁes substantially as the cell size increases, and can
be a major impediment for the uptake of some nutrient metals
(Zn, Co, Fe) in larger cells (Hudson and Morel, 1993; Sunda and
Huntsman, 1995a; Sunda, 2001). Another complicating factor is

were held constant at 2.7 and 1.5 pM, respectively, within the range of
values for near-surface ocean water (Bruland, 1992; Saito et al., 2004).
Uptake rates for Cd and Co increase by at least two orders of magnitude
when Zn(cid:2) concentrations decrease below 10−10 M. The large increase in
uptake rates reﬂect the induction of a high-afﬁnity cellular transport system
(or systems) for Cd and Co in response to declining intracellular Zn levels or
transport of the two metals into the cell by an inducible high-afﬁnity Zn
transport system. Data are from Sunda and Huntsman (2000).

that the V max of metal uptake systems is often under negative
feedback regulation by the cell and can decrease substantially with
increases in [M
] and intracellular metal pools (Sunda and Hunts-
man, 1992, 1998b). This behavior can be particularly problematic
in ﬁtting Eq. 1 to the results of short-term metal uptake experi-
ments as the V max of the transport system investigated can vary
during the course of the experiment (Sunda and Huntsman, 1985,
1986, 1992). A ﬁnal complicating factor is that the values of K s
can increase and V max decrease with increasing concentrations of
competing metals that bind with and are taken up intracellularly
by the transport system, as occurs for Cu, Cd, and Zn inhibition
of Mn uptake and Cu inhibition of Zn uptake (Sunda and Hunts-
man, 1996, 1998c). All of these complicating factors must be taken
into account for the proper application of the Michaelis Menten
equation to laboratory and ﬁeld metal uptake data.

Uptake systems are highly variable and range from simple to
highly complex depending on the chemical speciation of the metal,
its biological demand (requirement) relative to its seawater avail-
ability, and the range of concentrations of available metal species.
Uptake systems appear to be simplest for dissolved Mn(II), which
is taken up in phytoplankton by a single high-afﬁnity transport
) that is under negative feedback
regulation (Sunda and Huntsman, 1985, 1986). In this negative
(cid:2)
feedback, as the concentration of Mn(II)
decreases, the V max of
the transport system is increased to maintain relatively constant
Mn uptake rates and intracellular Mn concentration. This constant
regulated cellular Mn level is two to four times higher than that
needed to support the maximum growth rate, providing a buffer
(cid:2)
against decreasing Mn
concentrations ([Mn
]) or increases in cel-
lular demand, as occurs with decreasing light intensity (see below).
(cid:2)
At sufﬁciently low [Mn

stant value and the cellular Mn uptake rate and intracellular Mn

Uptake systems for Zn, Cd, Co, and Cu are more complex.
Like that of Mn(II), algal uptake of these metals is believed to be
related to the concentration of dissolved inorganic metal species
(M
) and metal chelates are generally not
directly available for metal uptake, with the exception of some Cu
chelates at low Cu
levels (Hudson, 1998; Sunda and Huntsman,
1998b; Guo et al., 2010). The phytoplankton species examined
to date have at least two separate Zn transport systems, a low-
afﬁnity system whose V max is relatively constant, and an inducible
high-afﬁnity system, whose afﬁnity (1/K s) and V max increase with
decreasing Zn

higher V max and K s values and transports Zn at high [Zn

high and low-afﬁnity uptake systems, whose high-afﬁnity uptake
system is under negative feedback regulation, are observed for Cu
in an oceanic diatom (Guo et al., 2010). The existence of high and
low-afﬁnity transport systems results in sigmoidal relationships
between uptake rates for Zn and Cu (and cellular Zn:C and Cu:C

Co and sometimes Cd can metabolically substitute for Zn in
many Zn enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase (Price and Morel,

substitution, the uptake of these divalent metals is increased by
over 100-fold in diatoms and coccolithophores with decreasing

[Zn
tions, Cd is taken up into the cell by the cellular Mn(II) transport
system (Sunda and Huntsman, 1996, 2000) or a putative Fe(II)
transport system (Lane et al., 2008), and consequently, is inversely

uptake of Cd in the ocean is regulated by complex interactions

among dissolved concentrations of Cd

(Sunda and Huntsman, 2000; Cullen and Sherrell, 2005; Lane et al.,

], biologi-
cal removal of Co often does not occur until after Zn is depleted, as
observed in the subarctic Paciﬁc (Figure 8; Sunda and Huntsman,

Iron is the most limiting trace metal nutrient, and its chemistry
is arguably the most complex. As noted earlier, iron is highly bound
in seawater as ferric chelates and ferric ions associated with various
particulate phases such as Fe(III) oxyhydroxides. Early evidence
suggested that cyanobacteria and eukaryotic marine algae utilized
fundamentally different uptake systems to access this bound iron
(Wilhelm and Trick, 1994; Hutchins et al., 1999). Both cyanobac-
teria and heterotrophic bacteria were thought to utilize primarily
siderophore uptake systems, in which high-afﬁnity Fe(III)-binding
ligands (siderophores) were released extracellularly, followed by
intracellular uptake of the resulting ferric-siderophore chelates
(Martinez et al., 2000; Sandy and Butler, 2009). Siderophore uptake
systems are widespread in terrestrial and enteric bacteria, and may
also be common in sedimentary and particle-associated marine
bacteria (Sandy and Butler, 2009). However, recent genomic data
from cultures and natural communities shows little evidence
for proteins involved in siderophore biosynthesis or for cellu-
lar uptake of ferric-siderophore chelates in the picocyanobacteria
(Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus) that often dominate open
ocean phytoplankton communities, or by major oceanic N2-ﬁxing
cyanobacteria such as Trichodesmium or Crocosphaera (Hopkin-
son and Morel, 2009; Hopkinson and Barbeau, 2012). Instead
these species possessed a high abundance of Fe3+
ATP binding
cassette (ABC) transporters, which can acquire iron from ligand
exchange reactions with dissolved labile Fe(III) species such as
Fe(III)
(Hopkinson and Barbeau, 2012). A reductive step, how-
ever, may be required to free the iron from ferric chelates, prior to
its uptake (Rose et al., 2005; Kranzler et al., 2011; Shaked and
Lis, 2012), and many marine cyanobacteria also possess non-
speciﬁc metal transporters that transport Fe(II) and other divalent
metals (Hopkinson and Barbeau, 2012). A coastal Synechococ-
cus isolate produced a suite of siderophores (synechobactins),
which like many other marine siderophores, are both photoreac-
tive and amphiphilic (Ito and Butler, 2005). But how widespread

decreasing phosphate is caused by the simultaneous removal of both
metals via cellular uptake and assimilation by phytoplankton. Cobalt
decreases with decreasing phosphate only after zinc concentrations drop to
very low levels (<0.2 nmol kg−1). This pattern is consistent with metabolic
replacement of Co for Zn, as observed in phytoplankton cultures (see

binds to Fe(II) recep-
tors on speciﬁc transmembrane proteins, which transport the iron
into the cell. This intracellular transport involves the reoxida-
tion of bound Fe(II) to Fe(III) by a copper protein (a multi-Cu
oxidase; Maldonado et al., 2006). The ability of this transport
system to access iron is dependent on the ease of reduction of

ferric complex species, which is inversely related to the stabil-
ity of the Fe(III) coordination complex (Maldonado and Price,
2001). Weakly complexed ferric hydrolysis species Fe(III)
are
reduced at orders of magnitude higher rates than strongly bound
Fe-siderophore chelates, and are thus much more accessible for
cellular uptake (Shaked et al., 2005; Morel et al., 2008). Likewise
Fe(III) colloids are less available because of their slow diffusion
kinetics within the cell’s diffusive boundary layer and because
interior ferric ions within the colloid are not readily accessible
for reduction and subsequent release as dissolved Fe(II). As a con-
sequence, iron uptake by this system is highly dependent on the
chemical speciation of iron in seawater, and increases in dissolved
Fe(II)
concentrations can considerably increase the bio-
logical availability of iron (Hudson and Morel, 1990; Morel et al.,
2008). Photo-reductive dissociation of ferric chelates increases
iron uptake by diatoms and other eukaryotic algae by increas-
ing steady state Fe(II)
concentrations, as shown
in culture experiments with photolabile ferric complexes with
synthetic chelators (e.g., ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, EDTA;
Anderson and Morel, 1982; Sunda and Huntsman, 2011), marine
siderophores (Barbeau et al., 2001; Amin et al., 2009), and sugar
acids (Ozturk et al., 2004; Figure 6). Similarly, in an incubation
experiment in the Southern Ocean, natural planktonic assem-
blages exhibited higher iron uptake rates from an added photoac-
tive siderophore (57Fe-aerobactin) in the presence of sunlight than
from a non-photoactive one (57Fe-desferrioximine b; Buck et al.,
2010).

and Fe(III)

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

In other recent iron uptake experiments in Southern Ocean
waters, the pre-equilibration of 55Fe-labeled iron with the mono-
saccharide glucuronic acid increased the uptake of the radiolabeled
iron by ∼2-fold compared to the uptake observed when iron was
added by itself (Hassler et al., 2011b). Similar enhanced uptake was
observed with the addition of polysaccharides. These effects may
be attributed to the formation of more biologically available weak
organic chelates (Hassler et al., 2011b; Benner, 2011). However as
noted above, dissolved ferric chelates and coordination complexes
of adsorbed sugar acids and polysaccharides on the surfaces of
iron oxyhydroxides can undergo photolysis and subsequent iron
redox cycling, which should increase Fe(II)
concen-
trations (Kuma et al., 1992; Ozturk et al., 2004; Steigenberger et al.,
2010), thereby providing a plausible alternative explanation for the
observed results. The inﬂuence of mono and polysaccharides on
iron chemistry, photochemical redox cycling, and bioavailability
needs further investigation given the high abundance of these com-
pounds in dissolved and colloidal marine organic matter and the
widespread production of extracellular polysaccharides by marine
phytoplankton and bacteria (Steigenberger et al., 2010; Benner,
2011; Hassler et al., 2011a,b).

CELLULAR TRACE METAL QUOTAS AND METAL:CARBON
RATIOS
The trace metal concentration in algal cells normalized to cell
volume or to cell carbon is not only dependent on the rates of intra-
cellular metal uptake by transport systems (as discussed above) or
adsorption on cell surfaces (Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2003), but also
by the rate of biodilution by new biomass or cell carbon (Sunda
and Huntsman, 1998b). The rate of change in cellular metal per

mole of cell carbon (dQ/dt) equals the cellular uptake rate V M
(normalized to cell carbon) minus the rate of biodilution, which
equals the net speciﬁc rate of C-ﬁxation (μc) times the cellular
metal:C ratio (Q):

= VM − μcQ

At steady state dQ/dt = 0 and the equation collapses to:

(cid:2)

Based on these equations, any factor that decreases growth rate
but has no or a lesser effect on the metal uptake rate will increase
the cellular metal:C ratio. This is seen in the response of cell Fe:C,
Mn:C, and Zn:C ratios in diatoms and dinoﬂagellates to light lim-
itation of growth rate, where a 60–70% decrease in speciﬁc growth
rate with a decrease in light intensity from 500 to 50 μmol quanta

−1 increased the cell metal:C ratios by two- to threefold for
m
a given [M
] (Sunda and Huntsman, 1997, 1998c, 2005). For Mn
and Fe, the higher Mn:C and Fe:C values helped the cells to pho-
toacclimate to the low light conditions (see Fe and Mn sections
below and Figure 9), and for Zn, the higher Zn:C ratio lowered
the [Zn
] needed to achieve maximum growth rate. However, as
discussed previously, decreasing light can also decrease Fe and
Mn uptake rates by decreasing [Fe
] levels, so the
overall effect of lower light may still be to lower cell Fe:C and
Mn:C ratios (Sunda and Huntsman, 2011). Temperature, another
major growth-controlling factor, could potentially also affect cellu-
lar M:C ratios, but in the one case examined to date, a temperature
decrease from 20 to 10˚C caused similar decreases in V M and
speciﬁc growth rate (at constant [Fe
]) so there was no effect on
cellular Fe:C ratios (Sunda and Huntsman, 2011).

Equations 2 and 3 also have important implications for diel
changes in cellular M:C ratios. Carbon is photosynthetically ﬁxed
only during the day (and a portion is respired at night), but metal
uptake can continue during both the light and dark period (Sunda
and Huntsman, 2004). Consequently, cellular M:C ratios should
decrease during the light period and increase at night. In agree-
ment with this prediction, the cell Fe:C ratio in an iron-limited
diatom (Thalassiosira pseudonana) growing at a speciﬁc rate of

from the beginning to the end of the 14 h light period (Sunda
and Huntsman, 2004). This result was for a metal chelate system
(Fe-nitrilotriacetic acid) with no photochemical enhancement of
(cid:2)
[Fe
] during the day, and the diel effect can be less or even reversed
in marine systems with substantial photochemical redox cycling
of iron (Sunda and Huntsman, 2004). For Zn, Co, Cd, and Ni,
where photochemical cycling does not occur, the cellular M:C
ratios should also decrease during the light period. This effect was
observed in the diatom T. pseudonana where cell Zn:C decreased by
twofold over the course of the light period (Sunda and Huntsman,
2004).

Metal uptake rates invariably increase with the concentration
of available metal as observed for Zn uptake in the oceanic diatom
Thalassiosira oceanica (Figure 7). For this diatom and the coccol-
ithophore Emiliania huxleyi the speciﬁc growth rate is unaffected

Cellular metal:C ratios can vary substantially among species.
The cell Zn:C was two- to ﬁvefold higher in the coccolitiophore E.
huxleyi than the diatoms T. oceanica and T. pseudonana, depend-
ing on the [Zn
] in the culture medium (Sunda and Huntsman,
1995a; Figure 5). Data of Ho et al. (2003) are consistent with
those of Sunda and Huntsman (1995a) and show a 10-fold varia-
tion in Zn:C ratios in 15 different marine algal species representing
ﬁve major algal groups (Figure 5). Even larger variations of 13-,
71-, and 50-fold, respectively, were observed for Cu:C, Co:C, Cd:C
(cid:2)
ratios in these same algal species grown at a constant set of [M
]
values (Ho et al., 2003).

Recent advances in synchrotron X-ray ﬂuorescence microscopy
has allowed measurement of metal:P and metal:S ratios in sin-
gle cells for a wide array of trace metals. As in the above culture
data, large intriguing variations were observed in different algal
cells and cell types present in the same water samples (Twining
et al., 2004, 2010, 2011). In a recent study in the equatorial Paciﬁc,
diatoms had sevenfold higher Ni:P ratios and fourfold higher Fe-P
and Zn:P ratios than autotrophic ﬂagellates (e.g., coccolithophores
and dinoﬂagellates), but had 2.5-fold lower Co:P ratios (Twining
et al., 2011).

Cells have the capacity to take up iron and other nutrient
metals in far excess of that needed to support growth and metab-
olism, which helps them to take advantage of pulsed inputs, such
as episodic increases in aeolian iron deposition associated with
large desert dust storms (Sunda and Huntsman, 1995b; Marche-
tti et al., 2006). This “luxury” uptake also protects cells from
future declines in metal availability as blooms develop or to
increases in metabolic demand for iron and other metals linked
to decreases in light or increases in temperature (Sunda and
Huntsman, 2011). In addition, because of a certain degree of
non-speciﬁcity of transport systems, many reactive trace metals

(including metal nutrients, e.g., Cu and Cd), can leak into cells
via the transport systems for other metal nutrients such as Mn
and Zn (Sunda and Huntsman, 1996, 1998c). Within the cell
unchelated redox active metals such as iron and copper can medi-
ate the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species (e.g., hydroxyl
radicals via Fenten chemistry) and reactive metals such as Cu,
Cd, and Zn can adventiciously bind with coordination sites of
proteins or displace nutrient metals from their active sites in met-
alloproteins (Hartwig, 2001; Valko et al., 2005). Consequently,
it is essential that “excess” concentrations of these metals be
sequestered within algal cells to prevent metal toxicity or inhibi-
tion of metabolism (Finney and O’Halloran, 2003). Excess iron
not occurring in metabolic proteins is bound within the iron
storage protein ferritin in the pennate diatom Pseudo-nitzschia
(Marchetti et al., 2009), and in Dps protein (another member
of the ferritin protein family) in the N2-ﬁxing cynaobacterium
Trichodesmium (Castruita et al., 2006). Both of these algae have
unusually high storage capacities for excess iron (Kustka et al.,
2003a; Marchetti et al., 2006). Many marine picocyanobacteria
(e.g., Synechococcus) possess genes for Dps or bacterioferritin iron
storage proteins although the actual presence of these proteins
has not yet been veriﬁed (Scanlan et al., 2009). Other marine
eukaryotic phytoplankton such as centric diatoms also have sub-
stantial capacities to store excess intracellular iron (Sunda and
Huntsman, 1995b), but the means by which they do so remains
unclear.

High intracellular levels of Cd or Cu in a variety of eukaryotic
phytoplankton are bound by phytochelatins, a set of sulfhydryl
containing chelating ligands found in terrestrial plants, microal-
gae, and fungi. These ligands consist of small polymers of
glutathione with the structure (γ-glutamate-cysteine)n-glycine,
where n = 2–11 (Ahner et al., 1995; Ahner and Morel, 1995; Ahner
et al., 1997). Although low basal levels of these cellular chelators
exist in cells, the cellular synthesis of phytochelatins is up-regulated
by exposure to high concentrations of toxic nutrient or non-
nutrient metals (e.g., Cd, Cu, or Hg) or low levels of competing

metal nutrients such as Zn or Mn, which promote increased
cellular Cd or Cu uptake (Ahner et al., 1998; see Figure 7).

METABOLIC METAL REQUIREMENTS AND THEIR RELATION
TO OTHER LIMITING RESOURCES
Trace metal nutrients are essential for the metabolism, growth,
and reproduction of all marine phytoplankton. They play essen-
tial roles in photosynthetic C-ﬁxation, respiration, N2-ﬁxation,
and the uptake and metabolic assimilation of major nutrient ele-
ments (N, P, and C). Thus the growth requirements of speciﬁc
metals are inﬂuenced by the availability of light and the concen-
tration and chemical forms of inorganic carbon, phosphorus and
nitrogen species. Of the trace metal nutrients, iron is needed in
the greatest amount for algal growth and most frequently limits
the growth of marine phytoplankton. It serves essential metabolic
functions in photosynthetic electron transport, respiration, nitrate
and nitrite reduction, sulfate reduction, N2-ﬁxation, and detox-
iﬁcation of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide radicals
and hydrogen peroxide (Raven, 1988; da Silva and Williams, 1991;
Raven et al., 1999).

The major requirement for iron in phytoplankton and likely all
phototrophs is in the primary photochemical reactions of photo-
synthesis and associated photosynthetic electron transport (Raven,
1990; Strzepek and Harrison, 2004). To acclimate to low, sub-
saturating light conditions, phytoplankton increase the cellular
concentration of photosynthetic pigments, reaction centers, and
electron transport proteins and protein complexes, and to do this
they need an increased amount of cellular iron (Raven, 1990).
These iron-containing photosynthetic components include pho-
tosystem II (2–3 Fe), the cyt f/b6 complex (5 Fe), photosystem I
(12 Fe), cytochrome c 6 (1 Fe), and ferredoxin (2 Fe; Raven et al.,
1999). This increased growth requirement for iron under low light
conditions has been conﬁrmed in culture experiments (Sunda and
Huntsman, 1997, 2011; Strzepek and Harrison, 2004; Figure 9A).
Such interactions between light and iron limitation can lead to
iron-light co-limitation of algal growth in low light environments
such as occur with deep vertical mixing during winter at higher lat-
itudes (e.g., the subarctic Paciﬁc and Southern Ocean; Maldonado
et al., 1999) and in the deep chlorophyll maximum near the bottom
of the photic zone in thermally stratiﬁed mid-ocean gyres (Sunda
and Huntsman, 1997; Hopkinson and Barbeau, 2008). Algal cells
acclimate similarly to a decrease in the photoperiod by increasing
their photosynthetic pigments and cellular iron requirement for
daily C-ﬁxation and growth (Sunda and Huntsman, 2004, 2011;
Figure 9A). Such day length effects could contribute to a higher
level of iron limitation of phytoplankton growth during the shorter
days of the fall than during the spring at high latitudes.

Iron is also needed for the assimilation of important chemical
forms of nitrogen, which next to carbon is the second most abun-
dant nutrient element in the cell. Nitrogen limits the growth and
biomass of phytoplankton in roughly 60% of the ocean (Moore
et al., 2002, 2004) and the overwhelming majority of biologi-
cally available ﬁxed nitrogen in deep ocean reservoirs occurs as
nitrate (Figure 2A). Nitrate is supplied to sunlit surface waters
by upwelling and vertical mixing of deep ocean waters, but to
utilize this substrate algal cells must ﬁrst reduce it to ammo-
nium, a process catalyzed by two iron-containing enzymes: nitrate

reductase and nitrite reductase. In addition, both enzymatic reac-
tions require the input of cellular energy (adenosine triphosphate,
ATP) and reductant molecules (NADPH), and large amounts of
cellular iron are needed for their photosynthetic production. Based
on model calculations (Raven, 1988) and empirical measurements
(Maldonado and Price, 1996), algal cells growing on nitrate require
∼50% more iron to support a given growth rate than do cells grow-
ing on ammonium. Consequently, iron can be especially limiting
in oceanic upwelling systems (such as the equatorial and subarctic
Paciﬁc) where waters containing high nitrate concentrations, but
low-iron, are advected to the surface (Martin and Fitzwater, 1988;
Coale et al., 1996; Boyd et al., 2007). The low-iron concentrations
favor the growth of small phytoplankton, which are rapidly grazed
by microzooplankton, preventing blooms from developing, whose
formation ultimately must be supported by inputs of upwelled
nitrate (Price et al., 1991, 1994). The rapid grazing also supplies
recycled ammonium which is more efﬁciently assimilated by the
iron-limited cells. Thus the net population growth of such systems
can be viewed as being co-limited by iron and nitrate due to the
high iron requirement for nitrate utilization (Price et al., 1994).

A more important iron-nitrogen linkage is provided by the
large metabolic requirement for iron in N2-ﬁxation. All eukary-
otic algae and most cyanobacteria are incapable of assimilating
N2 which is present at a high concentration in the atmosphere
(a mole fraction of 0.81) and in all ocean waters. Certain marine
cyanobacteria, such as members of the genera Trichodesmium and
Chrocosphera, are able to enzymatically reduce N2 to ammonium
(referred to as N2-ﬁxation; Zehr, 2011). N2-ﬁxation requires very
high amounts of cellular iron, and consequently, Trichodesmium
growing on N2 as a nitrogen source require up to ﬁve times more
cellular iron for growth than cells growing on ammonium (Kustka
et al., 2003a). This much higher iron requirement is partly caused
by the large amount of iron in the N2-ﬁxation enzyme nitro-
genase, and the low catalytic rate of this enzyme (Kustka et al.,
2003b). However, it is also caused by the large amount of energy
in the form of ATP needed to break the N2 triple bond (16 ATP per
N2 molecule), which must be supplied either directly or indirectly
from photosynthesis. As a result of the high metabolic iron cost
and the low-iron concentrations in seawater, iron appears to limit
N2-ﬁxation in large regions of the ocean, and along with denitri-
−
ﬁcation (respiratory reduction of NO
3 to N2), controls oceanic
inventories of ﬁxed nitrogen (Rueter et al., 1992; Falkowski, 1997;
Kustka et al., 2003a; Sohm et al., 2011). Consequently, nitro-
gen is the primary limiting major nutrient in most ocean waters
(Moore et al., 2004), while in lakes, where iron concentrations are
much higher, phosphate is typically the primary limiting nutrient
(Schindler, 1977). Because the low level of ﬁxed nitrogen in the
ocean is largely caused by iron limitation of N2-ﬁxation, the ocean
can be viewed as being co-limited by iron and nitrogen.

Ocean N2-ﬁxation is largely restricted to warm tropical and
subtropical waters (Moore et al., 2004; Zehr, 2011). N2-ﬁxation
varies regionally in these waters and is greatest in areas receiving
high iron inputs from deposition of desert dust (or other conti-
nental sources), such as the subtropical North Atlantic, Arabian
Sea, and the western margin of the Paciﬁc (Sohm et al., 2011). And
N2-ﬁxation is lowest in the South Atlantic and South Paciﬁc where
continental inputs of iron are low. N2-ﬁxation in regions with high

Phytoplankton and trace metal nutrients in the ocean

atmospheric iron inputs tend to be dominated by Trichodesmium,
which typically forms colonies 1–3 mm in diameter (Sohm et al.,
2011). The colonies are able to intercept iron-containing dust par-
ticles and physically transport them to the colony’s interior where
the iron is solubilized and assimilated by unidentiﬁed reductive
processes (Rueter et al., 1992; Rubin et al., 2011). The colonies can
−1, as enabled by the
vertically migrate at velocities exceeding 3 m h
large colony size and variations in speciﬁc gravity (Walsby, 1992).
This vertical movement increases the colony’s encounter frequency
with iron-containing dust particles, which further facilitates iron
uptake (Sunda, 2001).

In the mid-ocean waters of the subtropical and tropical Paciﬁc,
continental inputs of iron are low as are iron concentrations,
and here N2-ﬁxation is dominated by much smaller unicellular
cyanobacteria, such as Crocosphaera watsonii (Montoya et al., 2004;
Sohm et al., 2011). The much smaller cell size (2–6 μm diameter),
and attendant higher surface to volume ratios and higher diffu-
sive ﬂux of soluble iron to cell surfaces (per unit of biomass)
help increase cellular iron uptake by these cyanobacteria in these
low-iron waters (Sunda, 2001). In addition, recent proteomic data
indicate that these cells undergo a large scale diel cellular cycle in
which a portion of the iron-containing proteins involved in photo-
synthesis are degraded near the end of the light period and the iron
released is then used to synthesize the iron-containing nitrogenase
needed for nighttime ﬁxation of N2, which is fueled by the ATP
produced from respiratory consumption of stored carbohydrates
(Saito et al., 2011). The nitrogenase proteins are then degraded
near the end of the dark period and the liberated iron is reused to
synthesize iron-containing photosynthetic proteins needed for C-
ﬁxation. This cellular strategy is energetically expensive, but solves
two critical problems in iron-limited oceanic waters: it tempo-
rally separates N2-ﬁxation and photosynthesis, and thereby avoids
poisoning of nitrogenase enzyme complex by photosynthetically
produced O2 (Zehr et al., 2001); and equally important, it reduces
the cellular iron requirement for diazotrophic growth by ∼40%
(Saito et al., 2011). The combination of higher iron uptake rates
related to small cell size and the lower cellular iron requirement
for diazotrophic growth provide a competitive advantage to Cro-
cosphaera in low-iron oceanic waters, such as those in vast regions
of the tropical and subtropical Paciﬁc.

Due to iron limitation of C-ﬁxation and N2-ﬁxation in major
regions of the ocean, iron plays a signiﬁcant role in regulating
carbon and nitrogen cycles in the ocean. It thus helps regulate
the biological CO2 pump discussed earlier, which along with the
physical CO2 pump, controls the ocean/atmosphere CO2 balance
and CO2-linked greenhouse warming (Martin, 1990; Sigman and
Boyle, 2000). There is evidence that climatically driven variations
in the input of iron-rich continental dust to the ocean has played
an important role in regulating glacial-interglacial climate cycles
by inﬂuencing the intensity of the biological CO2 pump (Martin,
1990; Falkowski, 1997; Martínez-Garcia et al., 2011).

Manganese may inﬂuence the growth and species composition
in certain low-Mn environments such as the subarctic Paciﬁc and
Southern Ocean, where Mn additions have been observed to stim-
ulate algal growth in bottle incubation experiments (Buma et al.,
1991; Coale, 1991). Mn occurs in the water oxidizing complex
of photosystem II (which contains four Mn atoms), and thus is

essential for oxygenic photosynthesis. Consequently, like iron, it
is needed in higher amounts for algal growth at low light intensi-
ties (Raven, 1990; Sunda and Huntsman, 1998d; Figure 9B), such
as the bottom of the photic zone where Mn concentrations are
often lower than at the surface (Figure 2H). Mn also occurs in
superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme that removes toxic
superoxide radicals, produced as byproducts of photosynthesis
(Peers and Price, 2004; Wolfe-Simon et al., 2006). Because it has
fewer metabolic functions, its cellular growth requirement is less
than that for iron (Figure 9A, B).

Quantitative requirements for Zn in marine phytoplankton are
similar to those for Mn (Sunda and Huntsman, 1995a, 1998d). Zn
is needed in a variety of essential proteins needed for cell growth
and replication (da Silva and Williams, 1991). It occurs in carbonic
anhydrase (CA), an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reaction:

−
HCO
3

+ H

+ ↔ CO2 + H2O

(4)

Thus CA is critical to intracellular CO2 transport and ﬁxation
and is needed to support the cell’s CO2 concentrating mecha-
nism(s) (Badger and Price, 1994). Higher amounts of this enzyme
are needed at low CO2 concentrations, leading to potential co-
limitation by Zn and CO2 in the ocean (Morel et al., 1994; Sunda
and Huntsman, 2005). However, the ∼40% increase in CO2 in
the atmosphere and surface ocean waters from the burning of
fossil fuels makes Zn-CO2 co-limitation less likely in the mod-
ern ocean than in pre-industrial times. Zinc occurs in zinc ﬁnger
proteins and RNA polymerase, involved in DNA regulation and
transcription, and in tRNA synthetase, involved in tRNA transla-
tion into proteins (da Silva and Williams, 1991). It is also found
in alkaline phosphatase, needed to acquire orthophosphate via
hydrolysis of organic phosphate esters, which dominate phosphate
pools in surface ocean waters with low P concentrations (Lomas
et al., 2010). Consequently, Zn and P may co-limit algal growth
in ocean regions where both nutrients occur at low levels such as
the Sargasso Sea (Wu et al., 2000; Shaked et al., 2006; Jakuba et al.,
2008). Zn additions have been found to stimulate algal growth
in bottle incubation experiments in the subarctic Paciﬁc and in
some coastal upwelling regimes along the eastern margin of the
Paciﬁc, but the effects were modest relative to those for added Fe
(Coale, 1991; Crawford et al., 2003; Franck et al., 2003). However,
Zn addition had a large effect on algal species composition, and
preferentially stimulated the growth of the coccolithophore E. hux-
leyi (Crawford et al., 2003), which has an unusually large cellular
uptake and growth requirement for Zn/Co (Sunda and Hunts-
man, 1995a; see Figure 5). E. huxleyi and other coccolithophores
are largely responsible for calcium carbonate formation and regu-
lation of ocean water alkalinity, which in turn inﬂuences the air-sea
exchange of CO2 (Dymond and Lyle, 1985). Thus, by affecting the
growth of coccolithophores, Zn (and possibly Co, see below) could
indirectly affect atmospheric CO2 and global climate.

Co and sometimes Cd can substitute for Zn in CA, alkaline
phosphatase and other Zn enzymes, leading to complex interac-
tions among the three metals in marine phytoplankton (Price and
Morel, 1990; Sunda and Huntsman, 1995a; Xu et al., 2007; Jakuba
et al., 2008; Saito and Goepfert, 2008; Figure 7). The presence
of Cd in CA appears to explain its nutrient-like distribution in

ocean waters (Figure 2E), and the identiﬁcation of a unique Cd-
CA enzyme in zinc-limited marine diatoms means that it functions
as a micronutrient in these microalgae (Park et al., 2007; Xu et al.,
2008). However, the substitution of Zn for Cd in this protein yields
a more catalytically active enzyme (Xu et al., 2008), suggesting that
Zn may have been evolutionarily the original metal center for this
enzyme.

Co also occurs in vitamin B12, an essential vitamin required for
growth of many eukaryotic algal species (Croft et al., 2005). This
vitamin is synthesized by bacteria but not by eukaryotic phyto-
plankton, resulting in potential interactions among Co availability,
B12-production by bacteria and B12-utilization by eukaryotic algae
in the ocean (Croft et al., 2005; Bertrand et al., 2007; Panzeca et al.,
2008). A speciﬁc requirement for Co not involving B12 or a meta-
bolic replacement for Zn is seen in marine cyanobacteria, including
members of the genera Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, but the
biochemical basis for this is not known (Sunda and Huntsman,
1995a; Saito et al., 2002). A similar Co-requirement for optimal
growth is observed in the bloom-forming prymnesiophytes E.
huxleyi (Sunda and Huntsman, 1995a; Jakuba et al., 2008) and
Chrysochromulina polylepis (Granéli and Risinger, 1994). Because
of its unique requirement by cyanobacteria, Co may inﬂuence
their growth in the ocean, as demonstrated by growth stimulation
of Synechococcus by added Co in the Costa Rico upwelling dome
(Saito et al., 2005).

Copper is also an essential micronutrient. It occurs along with
iron in cytochrome oxidase, the terminal protein in respiratory
electron transport that reduces O2 to H2O (da Silva and Williams,
1991). And it occurs in plastocyanin, which substitutes for the
iron protein cytochrome c 6 in photosynthetic electron transport
in oceanic diatoms (Peers and Price, 2006), some cyanobacteria
(Scanlan et al., 2009), and the prymnesiophyte E. huxleyi (Guo
et al., 2012). It is also an essential component of the high-afﬁnity
iron transport system of at least some eukaryotic algae (Maldon-
ado et al., 2006; Kustka et al., 2007) and possibly some oceanic
cynaobacteria (Guo et al., 2012). Because Cu is needed for Fe
uptake and can metabolically substitute for Fe, co-limitations
can occur for Cu and Fe, as observed in diatom cultures (Peers
et al., 2005; Annett et al., 2008), and also in deck-board incuba-
tion experiments in iron-limited ocean water (Coale, 1991). These
co-limitations are most prevalent for oceanic algal species, where
substitutions of Cu proteins (plastocyanonin and Cu/Zn-SOD)
for iron enzymes (cytochrome c6 and Fe-SOD) may help decrease
the Fe growth requirements of oceanic species (Annett et al., 2008;
Guo et al., 2012).

Nickel has only a minimal known usage in marine phytoplank-
ton. It serves as the active metal center in urease, which hydrolyzes
urea to ammonium. Consequently, it is essential for utilization of
urea, an important nitrogen source in N-limited oceanic waters
(Price and Morel, 1991). Recently a Ni-superoxide dismutase (Ni-
SOD) was found to occur in marine cyanobacteria, a dominant
group of picophytoplankton in open ocean waters (Dupont et al.,
2008a,b). This ﬁnding may explain the unusually high Ni:P ratios
in picoplankton (which were presumed to be cyanobacteria) in
the equatorial Paciﬁc (Twining et al., 2011). The Ni-SOD ﬁndings
may be of signiﬁcance evolutionarily as other forms of this critical
antioxidant enzyme, which contain other metals in their catalytic

centers (i.e., Fe-SOD, Mn-SOD, and Cu/Zn-SOD), are the main
SODs in eukaryotic algae and virtually all land plants and ani-
mals. Thus, the occurrence of Ni-SOD in oceanic cyanobacteria
may help to reduce the biochemical demand for other micronu-
trient metals (Fe, Zn, Cu, and Mn) which generally occur at lower
concentrations than Ni in surface ocean waters (see Figures 2
and 3).

Mo occurs with Fe in several key N-assimilation enzymes,
including nitrogenase and nitrate reductase (da Silva and Williams,
1991). Thus, it is important in the ocean’s nitrogen cycle; however,
it is unlikely to limit algal growth due to the high concentration of
molybdate ions in ocean water (105 nM; Collier, 1985). In addi-
tion to the Fe-Mo enzyme, some N2-ﬁxing bacteria also contain
other isoforms of nitrogenase, one that contains a homologous Fe-
S cluster without Mo in its active center and another that contains
Fe and vanadium (Boyd et al., 2011). Thus Mo is not absolutely
essential for N2-ﬁxation. However, the Fe-Mo enzyme is at least
50% more catalytically active than either of the other two isoforms
which helps to minimize Fe-limitation of N2-ﬁxation in the ocean
(Anbar and Knoll, 2002).

BIOLOGICAL FEEDBACK ON SEAWATER CHEMISTRY
The interactions between trace metal nutrients and marine phy-
toplankton are reciprocal. While trace metals clearly inﬂuence the
productivity and species composition of planktonic algae and bac-
teria, these microorganisms in turn have a profound effect on
the chemistry and cycling of these metals in the ocean on a vari-
ety of time and spatial scales (Figure 1). One example of this
interaction is the effect of algal uptake, particulate settling, and
regeneration cycles on the vertical distribution and inter-ocean
transfer of nutrient metals, as described earlier (Figures 2 and 3).
In addition marine biota inﬂuence the chemical speciation of met-
als through a variety of processes: (1) the release of metal chelates
and metal chelating ligands through zooplankton grazing, diges-
tion, and defecation, and through viral lysis of cells and microbial
degradation processes (Poorvin et al., 2004; Strzepek et al., 2005);
(2) the active release of chelating compounds such as siderophores
(Butler and Theisen, 2010) and polysaccharides (Hassler et al.,
2011a), and (3) the reduction and oxidation of redox active met-
als (Fe, Mn, Co, and Cu) by various biological processes. These
processes include the reduction of iron and copper by cell sur-
face reductases (Strzepek et al., 2011) or by biologically produced
reducing agents (Rose et al., 2005), reduction of metals within
particulate reducing microzones generated by microbial respira-
tion, and oxidation of Mn(II), Co(II), and Fe(II) to their respective
oxides by speciﬁc groups of bacteria (Moffett and Ho, 1996).

One of the most important effects of microorganisms on trace
metal chemistry is in mediating the production of organic ligands
that chelate Fe, Cu, Zn, and Co, especially in oceanic environ-
ments where the supply of terrestrial humic materials and other
land-derived chelators is minimal. This chelation minimizes the
loss of these essential metals by abiotic (and biotic) particulate
scavenging and thereby minimizes their loss from ocean waters.
The organic carbon needed for the in situ formation of these
ligands is ultimately derived from algal photosynthesis, and thus
the production of these ligands is at least indirectly dependent
on marine algal productivity. However, many of these ligands

Phytoplankton and trace metal nutrients in the ocean

(cid:2)

appear to directly result from biological processes, and at least
some directly facilitate biological uptake of metals. The release
of siderophores clearly facilitates biological uptake of iron, as the
releasing bacteria have speciﬁc transport systems for active uptake
of iron-siderophore chelates (Butler and Theisen, 2010). How-
ever, most iron-siderophore chelates are orders of magnitude less
available for algal uptake than is unchelated Fe
(Shaked et al.,
2005), and thus, in facilitating their own iron uptake, the bacteria
could inadvertently lessen the uptake of iron by phytoplankton.
Such an effect in turn could lessen photosynthetic production
of organic carbon on which the bacteria depend for growth and
survival. To avoid this conundrum, nature may have devised a
clever mechanism to allow the bacteria to sequester iron for their
own use, and at the same time make it more available to sup-
port photosynthetic ﬁxation of carbon in sunlit surface ocean
waters. Unlike the siderophores produced by soil and enteric bac-
teria, whose iron-siderophore chelates are unaffected by exposure
to sunlight, the iron chelates of most siderophores produced by
near-surface marine bacteria undergo photolysis owing to the
presence of alpha hydroxy-carboxylate functional groups (Bar-
beau et al., 2003; Vraspir and Butler, 2009; Butler and Theisen,
2010). By contrast, these photoactive functional groups are rela-
tively rare in terrestrial siderophores (Barbeau et al., 2003). The
photolysis of the siderophore chelates can substantially increase
the steady state concentrations of biologically available Fe(II)
and
Fe(III)
species, and thereby increases the uptake of iron by phyto-
plankton, as directly shown in culture experiments with marine
diatoms and dinoﬂagellates (Barbeau et al., 2001; Amin et al.,
2009). In this way the bacteria are not only able to increase the
availability of iron to themselves, but to phytoplankton in sunlit
surface waters, thereby promoting the photosynthetic production
of organic carbon needed for bacterial growth and reproduction,
and ultimately for the production of siderophores. It is notewor-
thy that the marine bacteria found in close mutualistic associ-
ation with marine dinoﬂagellates and cocolithophores produce
(cid:2) = 10.9), which
a weaker iron-siderophore (vibrioferrin; log K Fe
contains two alpha hydroxy ligand groups, and is 10- to 20-times
more photoreactive than the siderophores produced by free liv-
ing marine bacteria (Amin et al., 2009). The in situ photolysis of
this siderophore in the presence of attenuated sunlight increased
the iron uptake rate in the dinoﬂagellate Scrippsiella trochoidea
by 20-fold but also increased the iron uptake rate by the pro-
ducing bacterium (Marinobacter sp.) by 70% (Amin et al., 2009).
Here the photolysis reaction not only promoted iron uptake by the
mutualistic algal partner, but also by the siderophore-producing
bacterium.

There is also evidence that the strong ligands that tightly
chelate Cu in seawater are produced by phytoplankton, especially
cyanobacteria. In stratiﬁed waters of the North Paciﬁc and Atlantic
such strong Cu-binding ligands often occur at highest levels near
the deep chlorophyll maximum where cyanobacteria are abun-
dant (Coale and Bruland, 1988, 1990; Moffett, 1995). The chelators
appear to perform an important function of detoxifying copper.
In the presence of the Cu-chelators the average Cu
in surface
Northeast Paciﬁc waters occurred at a non-toxic concentration
(cid:2)
(1.2 pM; Table 1) while in their absence Cu
levels would have
been 500 pM, a level toxic to many marine phytoplankton (Brand

(cid:2)

et al., 1986; Coale and Bruland, 1988). Ligands having similar Cu-
(cid:2) = 11.8) as many of the strong chelators
binding strength (log K Cu
in surface seawater are produced by Synechococcus, an abundant
group of oceanic cyanobacteria, that are particularly sensitive to
copper toxicity (Brand et al., 1986; Moffett, 1995; Moffett and
Brand, 1996). In experiments with Synechococcus, the production
of the ligand was greatly enhanced in response to additions of
toxic levels of Cu, indicating that the cyanobacteria can actively
modulate the availability and toxicity of Cu in their external envi-
ronment via production of Cu-chelators. Similar enhanced ligand
production in response to added Cu was observed in cultures
of eukaryotic phytoplankton, but the stability constants for Cu-
(cid:2) = 9.2–10.8) were lower than
binding by these ligands (log K Cu
those for the chelators released by Synechococcus (Croot et al.,
2000).

There is also evidence from laboratory and ﬁeld experiments
that the strong ligands that chelate Co in seawater are also pro-
duced by cyanobacteria, and that these ligands, like siderophores,
facilitate the uptake of the chelated metal (Co) by these organisms
(Saito et al., 2002, 2005).

Thus, trace metal nutrients and planktonic communities com-
prise an interactive system in the ocean in which each exerts a
controlling inﬂuence on the other (Figure 1). On longer geologi-
cal time scales, the feedback interactions between microorganisms
and the chemistry and availability trace metals have been pro-
found, and have substantially inﬂuenced the overall chemistry and
cycling of major biological elements (C, O, H, N, and S) in the
ocean and the earth as a whole, and have had a major impact on
the evolution of life on this planet (da Silva and Williams, 1991).
Currently, the air we breathe and virtually the entire ocean contain
high concentrations of dioxygen molecules (O2), generated over
billions of years from the release of O2 as a byproduct of oxygenic
photosynthesis. Because of the presence of O2, the modern ocean
is oxidizing, which as noted previously, limits the solubility of crit-
ical trace metal nutrients (Fe, Co, and Mn) whose stable oxidation
states under oxic conditions are sparingly soluble Fe(III) oxyhy-
droxides and insoluble Co(III) and Mn(IV) oxides. However, prior
to the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis ca 3 billion years ago
(Blankenship et al., 2007) and the appearance of O2 in the atmos-
phere 2.4–2.3 billion years ago (Bekker et al., 2004), the chemistry
of the atmosphere and the ocean were far different from what
exists today. There was no free O2 and the entire ocean, and earth’s
surface and atmosphere were chemically much more reducing (da
Silva and Williams, 1991). Under these conditions the stable redox
states of Fe, Mn, and Co were soluble Fe(II), Mn(II), and Co(II),
and that of copper was Cu(I). Furthermore, the stable redox form
of sulfur was sulﬁde (S[-II]), rather than sulfate (S[VI]), which
occurs in present day seawater at a high concentration (28 mM).
The presence of moderate to high levels of sulﬁde greatly restricted
the availability of Zn, Cu, Mo, and Cd, which form insoluble sulﬁde
precipitates and biologically less available metal sulﬁde complexes;
but it had a much a lesser impact on other metals [Mn(II), Fe(II),
Co(II), and Ni(II)] which form much more soluble metal sulﬁdes
(da Silva and Williams, 1991; Saito et al., 2003). Thus, early life in
the ocean likely evolved in an environment of high availability of
Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni and much lower availabilities of Zn, Mo, Cu,
and Cd, contrasting the situation in the modern ocean.

Phytoplankton and trace metal nutrients in the ocean

Given the utility of Fe as a versatile redox catalyst and its
abundance in the earth’s crust and early ocean, it is perhaps not
surprising that this metal was utilized in the evolution of many of
the central redox catalysts of life (Mauzerall, 2007). It occurs in
high amounts in the redox centers of nitrogenase responsible for
N2 reduction to NH3 and in the various cytochromes and Fe-S
redox centers involved in anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthe-
sis (da Silva and Williams, 1991; Raven et al., 1999). In addition,
the abundant soluble Mn(II) in the ancient ocean was utilized in
the evolution of the water oxidizing centers of photosystem II,
which allowed cyanobacteria to utilize abundant water molecules
as a photosynthetic electron donor, thereby freeing photosynthetic
primary producers from the need to utilize much less abundant
substrates such as sulﬁde or ferrous ions (Mauzerall, 2007). The
resultant oxidation of H2O to O2 and burial of photosynthetically
produced organic carbon in marine sediments and sedimentary
rocks, slowly (over 1–2 billion years) oxidized Fe(II) to Fe(III)
oxides and sulﬁde minerals to soluble sulfate, ultimately resulting
in the buildup of free O2 ﬁrst in the atmosphere and surface ocean
beginning ca. 2.3 billion years ago, and gradually in the ocean as
a whole by ∼500–600 million years before present (Anbar and
Knoll, 2002; Katz et al., 2007). The precipitation of ferric oxides

from the sea has resulted in the chronic Fe-limitation of C-ﬁxation
and N2-ﬁxation that we currently observe in the ocean. However,
this negative effect is more than offset by the large amount of
biological energy produced by O2-dependent respiration utilized
by all present day plants and animals and most aerobic microbes.
Indeed the large amount of energy obtained from the respiratory
reaction of O2 with organic molecules likely was essential for the
development of multicellular forms of life, paving the way for the
evolution of mammals, including man (Mauzerall, 2007). Further-
more, the release of Zn, Cu, Mo, and Cd from insoluble sulﬁdes
and biologically unavailable sulﬁde complexes allowed for the pro-
liferation of numerous enzymes utilizing these metals (including
many Zn and Cu enzymes), many of which appear to have evolved
following the appearance of free O2 (da Silva and Williams, 1991).
Thus, evolution has involved a continuous feedback between bio-
logical systems and the surrounding chemical environment, with
biological trace metal catalysts playing a central mediating role in
this process.
