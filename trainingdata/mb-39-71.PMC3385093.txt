The  phylogenetic  relationships  of  the  most  dominant  and  morphologically  cryptic  endophytic  fungal  isolates  from  each  of
five  selected  medicinal  plants,  namely  Potentilla  fulgens,  Osbeckia  stellata,  Osbeckia  chinensis,  Camellia  caduca,  and  Schima
khasiana  of  the  biodiversity  rich  state  of  Meghalaya,  were  assessed  with  random  amplification  of  polymorphic  DNA  and
PCR-restriction  fragment  length  polymorphism  profiles.  Sequencing  of  the  internal  transcribed  spacer  1,  small  subunit  rRNA
and  partial  β-tubulin  gene  fragments  was  also  conducted  to  determine  the  phylogenetic  relationships  of  these  isolates  with
fungal  sequences  available  in  Genbank,  NCBI.  The  identity  of  the  fungal  isolates  is  suggested  based  on  the  molecular  phy-
logenetic  data.

The  hill  state  of  Meghalaya  in  the  north-eastern  region  of
India  (20.1o  N~26.5o  N  latitude,  85.49o  E~92.52o  E  longi-
tude) is part of the Indo-Burma mega-biodiversity hotspot.
Local  communities  in  this  region  have  traditionally  used
and  relied  on  herbs  and  plants  for  treating  various  ail-
ments [1]. These medicinal plants are mostly found in the
traditionally  preserved  ‘sacred  forests,’  which  have  remained
untouched  for  centuries  due  to  the  religious  beliefs  of  the
indigenous  tribal  inhabitants.  These  private  and  commu-
nity-managed sacred forests also represent the climax veg-
etation  of  the  area  and  are  home  to  many  medicinal  plant
species [2]. Plants growing in unique habitats and that are
used as ethno-medicines to treat human diseases among the
local  ethnic  population  are  often  likely  to  harbour  novel
endophytic fungi [3]. Based upon this rationale, five medic-
inal  plants,  i.e.,  Potentilla  fulgens,  Osbeckia  stellata,
Osbeckia  chinensis,  Camellia  caduca  and  Schima  khasi-
ana  were  selected  for  a  study  of  their  associated  endo-
phytic mycoflora. Isolation followed by biological activity
studies  of  some  of  the  endophytic  isolates  from  these
plants  indicates  their  potential  for  novel  biotechnological
applications  [4].  Endophytic  fungi  often  exhibit  ‘cryptic’
morphological characters [5]. Our previous experience with
identifying  some  of  these  isolates,  particularly  the  first  of
the RS07PF series originally isolated from the tap roots of
P.  fulgens,  indicates  that  the  cryptic  morphological  iden-

tity  exhibited  by  some  of  these  fungal  endophytes  can  be
resolved  with  the  help  of  molecular  genetic  marker-based
identification  [6].  The  dominant  and  most  frequently  iso-
lated  endophytic  fungal  isolates  from  each  of  the  five
selected  medicinal  plants  exhibited  cryptic  morphological
characters,  making  it  necessary  to  identify  them  using
molecular  tools  and  techniques.  In  the  present  investiga-
tion, we developed the most likely phylogenetic classifica-
tion  of  the  five  endophytic  fungi  under  study  with  the
collective  patterns  generated  by  random  amplification  of
polymorphic  DNA  (RAPD),  PCR-restriction  fragment
length  polymorphism  (PCR-RFLP),  internal  transcribed
spacer (ITS), partial 18S rDNA and partial β-tubulin gene
sequencing.

Materials  and  Methods

Isolation  of  endophytic  fungi  from  medicinal  plants.
Five  selected  ethno-medicinal  plants  i.e.,  P.  fulgens,  O.
stellata,  O.  chinensis,  C.  caduca,  and  S.  khasiana  were
collected  from  Nongkrem,  Cherrapunji,  Mawphlang  and
Umsaw  sacred  forests  spread  over  the  state  of  Megha-
laya, India (Table 1). About 100 surface sterilised root and
stem  pieces  of  each  of  the  five  plants  were  air  dried  and
flamed  before  removing  the  outer  layers  [7].  Two  centi-
metre long pieces of these roots and stems were placed on

Petri  dishes  containing  water  agar,  as  described  by  Stro-
bel  et  al.  [8]  and  incubated  at  24oC  for  7  days.  After  the
incubation,  hyphal  tips  of  developing  fungi  were  asepti-
cally removed and placed on potato dextrose agar, accord-
ing  to  Strobel  et  al.  [9].  The  most  frequently  isolated
endophytic  fungal  isolates  (RS07PF,  RS07OS,  RS07OC,
RS07CC, and RS07SK) from each of the medicinal plants
were selected for molecular characterisation (Table 2).

Fungal  DNA  extraction. DNA  was  extracted  from  the
five endophytic fungi using the HiPerTM Fungal DNA mini
kit  (MBT032)  (HiMedia  Laboratories  Private  Ltd.,  Mum-

RAPD  analysis. RAPD  analysis  of  the  five  endophytic
fungi  was  conducted  with  GeNeiTM  RFu-C  Fungal  RAPD
primers  (Bangalore  Genei,  Karnataka,  India).  Ten  primers
i.e.,  primer  1~10  were  screened  with  each  of  the  endo-
phytic  fungal  isolates.  Of  the  10  primers  screened,  primer
Nos.  4  and  7  were  selected  for  RAPD  profile  generation,
based  on  the  presence  of  scorable  bands  with  these  prim-
ers. Each sample was amplified at least three times to ver-
ify reproducibility. The reaction consisted of the following
in a 25 µL volume: 1 µL (15 ng) template DNA, 1 µL primer
DNA  (5 µM  stock),  0.375 µL  dNTPs  (10 mM  stock),
1.5 µL  Mg2+  (25 mM  stock),  2.5 µL  10×  Taq  DNA  poly-
merase  reaction  buffer  (500 mM  KCl,  100 mM  Tris-HCl,
1.0%  Triton  X-100)  and  0.36 µL  Taq  DNA  polymerase
(5 U/µL;  Promega,  Madison,  WI,  USA).  The  DNA  sam-
ples  were  amplified  in  a  GeneAmp®  9700  thermal  cycler
(Applied  Biosystems  Inc.,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA),  using
the  following  thermal  profile:  5 sec  at  95oC;  1 min  55 sec
at  92oC;  followed  by  45  cycles  of  5 sec  at  95oC,  55 sec  at
92oC,  1 min  at  35oC,  and  2 min  at  72oC;  followed  by
7 min  at  72oC  [10].  Amplification  products  were  separated
by electrophoresis on 1.8% agarose gels with 1× Tris-ace-
tate-EDTA  (TAE)  buffer  at  70  volts.  The  RAPD  profiles
generated  were  photographed  using  Kodak  Gel  logic  100
gel  documentation  system  (Kodak,  Rochester,  NY,  USA).
The  data  analysis  and  dendrogram  generation  using  the
RAPD banding patterns was performed using the Numeri-
cal  Taxonomy  System  NTSYSpc,  ver.  2.2  for  Windows
XP (Exeter Software, Setauket, NY, USA).

PCR-RFLP. RFLP  patterns  of  the  PCR  amplified  ITS,
small  subunit  (SSU)  rDNA  and  β-tubulin  gene  products
were generated with the MspI, AluI, NdeII, HaeIII and HinfI
restriction enzymes (Bangalore Genei). Digestion was per-
formed  by  incubating  a  20 µL  aliquot  of  the  PCR  prod-
ucts with 10 units of the respective restriction enzyme in a
final  reaction  volume  of  25 µL  at  37oC  for  2 hr  [11].
Restriction fragments were separated by 1.8% agarose gel

electrophoresis  in  Tris-Borate-EDTA  (TBE)  buffer  for
approximately 45 min at 100 volts and visualised by stain-
ing  with  ethidium  bromide  in  a  Kodak  Gel  logic  100  gel
documentation  system.  Dendrograms  based  on  the  restric-
tion  patterns  were  generated  with  the  Numerical  Taxon-
omy System NTSYSpc.

PCR  amplification  and  sequencing  of  the  ITS  region.
Amplification  of  the  endophytic  fungi  ITS  region  was
performed  using  fungal  domain  specific  ITS1f  and  5.8S
primers [12]. The PCR reaction mixture was comprised of
10 µL  fungal  DNA,  5 µL  10×  PCR  buffer,  1.5 µL  of
50 mM  MgCl2,  1 µL  of  10 mM  dNTP,  0.25 µL  Taq  poly-
merase,  40 pM  each  of  the  forward  and  the  reverse  prim-
ers  in  a  total  reaction  volume  of  50 µL  [13].  Amplification
was  performed  in  a  GeneAmp®  9700  Thermal  Cycler
(Applied  Biosystems),  and  PCR  conditions  were  15 min
at  95oC,  followed  by  40  cycles  of  95oC  for  1 min,  30 sec
at  the  annealing  temperature,  and  72oC  for  1 min  [12].
Aliquots  (10 µL)  of  each  amplified  product  were  electro-
phoretically  separated  on  a  2%  agarose  gel  in  1×  TAE
buffer  and  visualised  using  ethidium  bromide  under  UV
illumination  in  an  Kodak  gel  logic  100  gel  documentation
system. A 100-bp DNA molecular weight ladder (Bangalore
Genei)  was  included  in  each  run.  PCR  amplicons  were
excised  and  purified  using  the  QIA  Quick  Gel  Extraction
Kit  (Qiagen,  Hilden,  Germany).  The  amplicons  were  then
sequenced in an Applied Biosystems 3700 Genetic Analy-
ser  with  BigDye  Terminator  ver.  3.1.  Sequences  (Gen-
Bank accession Nos.: HM569608, HM569609, HM569610,
HM569611, and HM569612) were then searched for simi-
larity  with  other  deposited  sequences  in  GenBank.  Align-
ments  and  phylogenetic  analyses  were  performed  using
MEGA4 software [14].

PCR  amplification  and  sequencing  of  the  SSU  rDNA
region. Amplification  of  the  SSU  rDNA  region  of  the
endophytic  fungal  genomes  was  conducted  using  the  fungi
specific primers nu-SSU-0817-5 and nu-SSU-1536-3 [15].
The  PCR  reaction  mixture  was  comprised  of  10 µL  fun-
gal DNA, 5 µL 10× PCR buffer, 1.5 µL of 50 mM MgCl2,
1 µL  of  10 mM  dNTP,  0.25 µL  Taq  polymerase,  40 pM
each  of  the  forward  and  the  reverse  primers  in  a  total
reaction  volume  of  50 µL  [13].  All  reagents  were  com-
bined and heated at 940oC for 2 min. Thirty-five cycles of
PCR  were  then  performed  at  94oC  for  0 sec,  56oC  for
10 sec,  and  72oC  for  30 sec,  followed  by  72oC  for  2 min
[15].  PCR  was  performed  in  a  GeneAmp®  9700  Thermal
Cycler  (Applied  Biosystems).  Aliquots  (10 µL)  of  each
amplified  product  were  electrophoretically  separated  on  a
2%  agarose  gel  in  1×  TAE  buffer  and  visualised  using
ethidium bromide under UV illumination in an Kodak gel
logic  100  gel  documentation  system.  A  100-bp  DNA
molecular  weight  ladder  (Bangalore  Genei)  was  included

in  each  run.  The  PCR  amplicons  were  excised  and  puri-
fied  using  a  QIA  Quick  Gel  Extraction  Kit  (Qiagen).  The
amplicons  were  then  sequenced  in  Applied  Biosystems
3700  Genetic  Analyser  with  BigDye  Terminator  ver.  3.1.
Sequences obtained (GenBank accession Nos.: HM581667,
HM581668, HM581669, HM581670, and HM581671) were
then  searched  for  similarity  with  other  deposited  sequences
in  GenBank.  Alignments  and  phylogenetic  analysis  were
performed using MEGA4 software [14].

PCR  amplification  and  sequencing  of  the  partial  β-
tubulin  gene. Amplification  of  the  partial  β-tubulin  frag-
ment  of  the  endophytic  fungal  genomes  was  conducted
using  the  universal  primers  btub3  and  btub4r  [16].  The
PCR  reaction  mixture  was  comprised  of  10 µL  fungal
DNA,  5 µL  10×  PCR  buffer,  1.5 µL  of  50 mM  MgCl2,
1 µL of 10 mM dNTP, 0.25 µL Taq polymerase, 40 pM of
each  forward  and  the  reverse  primers  in  a  total  reaction
volume  of  50 µL  [13].  The  PCR  amplification  was  per-
formed  in  a  GeneAmp®  9700  Thermal  Cycler  with  the
following  thermal  protocol:  initial  strand  denaturation  at
94oC  for  5 min,  followed  by  35  cycles  of  94oC  for  1 min,
59oC  for  1 min  and  72oC  for  1.5 min  and  a  final  exten-
sion  step  at  72oC  for  7 min  [17].  The  PCR  products  were
analysed  by  2%  agarose  gel  electrophoresis  and  visual-
ised  using  ethidium  bromide  under  UV  illumination  in  a
Kodak gel logic 100 gel documentation system. A 100-bp
DNA  molecular  weight  ladder  was  included  in  each  run.
The  amplicons  were  then  sequenced  in  an  Applied  Bio-
systems  3700  Genetic  Analyser  with  BigDye  Terminator
ver.  3.1.  Sequences  obtained  (GenBank  accession  Nos.:
HM596779,  HM596780,  HM596781,  HM596782,  and
HM596783)  were  searched  for  similarity  with  other  depos-
ited  sequences  in  GenBank.  Alignments  and  phylogenetic
analyses were performed using MEGA4 software [14].

Results  and  Discussion

The  genetic  relatedness  dendrogram  generated  by  scoring
of  the  presence  or  absence  of  reproducible  bands  of  fun-
gal specific RAPD primers Nos. 4 and 7 clearly showed the
genetic variability between the five endophytic fungal spe-
cies  isolated  from  five  different  ethno-medicinally  impor-
tant plants in the sacred forests of Meghalaya (India) (Fig.
1).  The  endophytic  fungus  isolated  from  O.  chinensis  and
C.  caduca  formed  a  cluster,  which  was  closely  related  to
the endophytic fungus isolated from P. fulgens. The endo-
phytic fungus  isolated  from  S.  khasiana  was distinct from
the  others  but  was  related  to  the  isolate  obtained  from  P.
fulgens  (Fig.  1).  The  endophytic  fungal  isolate  obtained
from  O.  stellata  was  the  most  divergent  in  terms  of  the
RAPD  distance  in  relation  to  the  other  four  endophytic
fungal isolates investigated.

the expected size of the amplicons with the specific prim-
ers used. The genetic relatedness pattern for the five endo-

β-tubulin  gene  sequences  of  the  five  endophytes  using
MEGA4  software  is  shown  in  Figs.  3~5.  The  intra-group
sequence  divergence  in  the  ITS1  region  among  the  five
endophytic  fungal  isolates  showed  that  the  endophytic
fungal  isolate  from  P.  fulgens  was  closely  related  to  that
of O. chinensis (Fig. 3). In contrast, the evolutionary simi-

larity  of  the  SSU  of  the  18S  rRNA  among  the  five  iso-
lates  showed  that  the  endophytic  fungal  isolate  from  O.
chinensis  was  closely  related  to  the  endophyte  isolated
from  S.  khasiana  with  97%  bootstrap  support  for  the
grouping.  The  endophytic  fungal  isolate  from  P.  fulgens
was  grouped  with  the  isolate  from  C.  caduca  (67%  boot-
strap  support)  (Fig.  4).  Analysis  of  the  intra-group  rela-
tionships among the five isolates of endophytic fungi with
evolutionary  sequence  similarity  of  the  partial  β-tubulin
gene  sequence,  showed  that  the  endophytic  fungal  isolate
obtained  from  P.  fulgens  was  closely  related  to  the  endo-
phytic  fungal  isolate  obtained  from  O.  chinensis,  with  a
bootstrap  support  of  92%  (Fig.  5).  In  all  three  phyloge-
netic  trees,  i.e.,  Figs.  3~5,  the  endophytic  fungal  isolate
from O. stellata was the most distantly related to the other
four  endophytes.  Although  the  overall  picture  generated

phytic  fungal  isolates  was  quite  similar  to  that  generated
by the RAPD and PCR-RFLP banding patterns, determin-
ing  the  sequences  of  particular  gene  fragments  may  pro-
vide  a  deeper  insight  into  the  genetic  relatedness  of  these
fungal  isolates.  Notably,  the  ITS1  and  β-tubulin  phyloge-
nies  represented  a  very  similar  picture  of  the  genetic  rela-
tionship  of  the  five  endophytic  fungal  isolates.  We  then
tested  the  phylogenetic  relationships  of  the  five  endo-
phytic  fungal  isolates  based  on  the  ITS1,  SSU  of  18S
rRNA  and  β-tubulin  gene  sequences  to  those  fungal  spe-
cies  having  sequences  deposited  in  public  repositories

such  as  the  NCBI  nucleotide  database.  Major  taxa  show-
ing  the  closest  homology  to  our  sequences  were  selected
and  aligned  using  the  ClustalW  program  in  the  MEGA4
software.  Phylogenetic  trees  were  constructed  using  the
neighbour-joining  algorithm  with  1,000  bootstrap  replica-
tions.  The  phylogenetic  trees  generated  from  the  ITS1,
SSU  of  18S  rRNA  and  β-tubulin  gene  sequences  are  pre-
sented in Figs. 6~8, respectively.

The  phylogenetic  tree  generated  by  the  ITS1  sequences
did  not  clarify  the  species  identity  of  the  endophytic  fun-
gal  species,  as  the  bootstrap  support  for  these  groupings

was generally low (Fig. 6). Isolate RS07OS was placed in
the  fungal  genus  Syncephalestrum,  whereas  isolates  RS07PF
and  PS07OC  showed  close  homology  with  an  unidentified
fungal species B3-2(III) 1 (accession Nos.: emb AM231356.1).
Isolate  RS07SK  was  a  species  of  Penicillium  with  close
homology  to  Penicillium  pinophilum  (accession  Nos.:  gb
DQ834939.1).  Endophytic  fungal  isolate  RS07CC  was
also unidentifiable, as it was closely related with unidenti-
fied  fungal  species  D5-(2)/1  (accession  Nos.:  emb  AM
231388.1) (Fig. 6). The phylogenetic tree generated by the
analysis of the sequence information of the SSU region of
the  fungal  18S  rRNA  (Fig.  7)  placed  all  endophytic  iso-
lates  into  Penicillium,  and  isolate  RS07SK  was  the  clos-
est  neighbour  of  P.  purpurogenum  (accession  Nos.:  gb
AF245268.1).  The  four  other  endophytic  isolates,  namely
RS07PF,  RS07OC,  RS07OS  and  RS07CC  branched  out
from  isolate  RS07SK  but  were  flanked  by  Penicillium
rugulosum (accession Nos.: gb EU263610.1) (Fig. 7). Bet-
ter  bootstrap  support  values  were  obtained  for  the  phylo-
genetic  tree  generated  by  the  β-tubulin  gene  sequences  of
the five endophytic fungal isolates (Fig. 8). The endophytic
fungal  isolate  obtained  from  O.  stellata,  i.e.,  RS07OS,  was
closely  related  to  Syncephalestrum  racemosum  (accession
Nos.: gb AY944811.1), whereas the β-tubulin gene sequences
of the other  endophytic  isolates  such  as  RS07PF,  RS07CC,
RS07OC  and  RS07SK  were  related  to  Penicillium  marn-
effei  and  Talaromyces  stipitatus  (Fig.  8).  Ribosomal  loci
with high and heterogeneous rates of change, such as ITS,
IGS and mitochondrial SSU rDNA, can be used to distin-
guish  taxa  at  the  genus  and  species  level  [18].  The  non-
coding regions of these loci are prone to significant length
variation, making alignment of distantly related taxa prob-
lematic.  Therefore,  fast  evolving  ribosomal  genes  are  less
useful  in  large-scale  concatenated  analyses  involving  higher-
level  phylogenetic  relationships  [18].  β-tubulin  is  abun-
dant  in  eukaryotic  cells  and  is  the  primary  constituent  of
microtubules  [16].  The  β-tubulin  gene  sequence  contains
3.5-fold  more  phylogenetic  information  than  that  of  the
SSU  rRNA  gene.  Thus,  the  β-tubulin  gene  is  an  ideal
marker  to  analyse  deep-level  phylogenies  and  complex
species  groups  [19].  However,  the  precise  homology  defin-

ing  a  species  using  phylogenetic  evidence  is  speculative
[20].  Endophytic  fungi  often  exhibit  ‘cryptic’  morphologi-
cal characters [5]. Thus, to arrive at the most probable iden-
tity for our isolates, we correlated our previously observed
morphological  data  with  the  molecular  data  generated  by
the  ITS1,  SSU  rRNA  and  β-tubulin  gene  sequence  analy-
ses (Table 3). The isolates that showed close homology to
P.  purpurogenum  based  on  SSU  rDNA  sequences  may
belong to a species complex (group) within  P. purpuroge-
num.  Therefore,  the  possibility  that  some  of  these  isolates
are  novel  fungal  species  cannot  be  completely  ruled  out.
We  believe  that  multi-loci  molecular  characterisation  of
endophytic  fungi  coupled  with  morphological  validation
will  help  fungal  taxonomists  unravel  the  yet  un-explored
world  of  cryptic  fungal  endophytes.  Efforts  are  currently
underway  to  deposit  the  isolates  in  microbial  culture  col-
lections  and  to  further  elucidate  their  biotechnologically
important genes and metabolites.
