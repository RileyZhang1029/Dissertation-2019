spindle

assembly

The accurate and timely transmission

of the genetic material to progeny
during successive rounds of cell division
is sine qua non for the maintenance of
genome stability. Eukaryotic cells have
evolved a surveillance mechanism,
the
mitotic
checkpoint
(SAC), to prevent premature advance to
anaphase before every chromosome is
properly attached to microtubules of the
mitotic spindle. The architecture of the
KNL1-BubR1 complex reveals important
features of
recognition
between SAC components and the kine-
tochore. The interaction is important
for a functional SAC as substitution of
BubR1 residues engaged in KNL1 bind-
ing impaired the SAC and BubR1
recruitment into checkpoint complexes
in stable cell lines. Here we discuss the
implications of
the disorder-to-order
transition of KNL1 upon BubR1 binding
for SAC signaling and propose a mecha-
nistic model of how BUBs binding may
affect the recognition of KNL1 by its
other interacting partners.

the molecular

The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is
an evolutionarily conserved and essential
self-regulatory mechanism of the eukaryo-
tic cell cycle that prevents defects in the
segregation of
sister chromatids during
mitosis.1,2 Proper sister chromatid separa-
tion requires
the
mitotic spindle are attached correctly to
the kinetochore, the large protein structure
established on the centromere region of
each chromatid. An outer ten-component
kinetochore complex referred to as the
KMN network
(KNL1-Mis12-Ndc80

that microtubules of

network) makes direct contact to micro-
tubules and integrates microtubule bind-
ing with SAC activity. The SAC triggers
anaphase delay in response to kineto-
chores incorrectly or not attached to the
mitotic spindle. The large multi-domain
protein kinases Bub1, BubR1 and Mps1
and the proteins Mad1, Mad2 and Bub3
are central components of the SAC that
localize at
incorrectly attached kineto-
chores. Mitotic checkpoint components
display different dynamics at the kineto-
chore: Mad1 and Bub1 are stable com-
ponents while BubR1, Mps1 and Mad2
are transient.1,2 The kinetochore localiza-
tion of SAC components is generally con-
sidered important for a proper checkpoint
and stimulates the binding of Mad2 and
the BubR1-Bub3 complex to Cdc20, thus
leading to its inhibition. Cdc20 is an
activator of
the Anaphase Promoting
Complex (APC/C), which is a large E3
ubiquitin ligase responsible for targeting
Securin and Cyclin B1 for degradation
leading to sister chromatid separation and
mitotic exit, respectively.3,4

In addition to their functions in the
checkpoint, Mps1, Bub1 and BubR1 play
a role in establishing proper kinetochore-
interactions.5,6 Whether
microtubule
multiple binding sites exist on the kine-
tochore for these checkpoint components
to perform their dual role is not clear. For
instance, BubR1 interacts with the kine-
tochore components KNL1 and Cenp-E
whereas electron microscopy (EM) data
suggest multiple binding sites for BubR1
in the kinetochore and FRAP experiments
indicate distinct pools of BubR1.7,8 The

that KNL1 is
the major binding partner for BubR1 at
the kinetochore.9 Furthermore, Bub1 and
BubR1 can both form a complex with
Bub3, a protein that also plays a role
in kinetochore binding. Interestingly, the
interacting partner(s) of Bub3 in the
kinetochore is (are) not known. Despite
the fact that there are many similarities
in the mode of binding of Bub1 and
BubR1 to the kinetochore, the dynamics
at the kinetochore of the two proteins
suggest that their binding is likely to be
regulated differently.10 The crystal struc-
ture of a BubR1-KNL1 complex that we
have determined recently provides insights
into this process and is the focus of the
present report.

The kinetochore protein KNL1 (also
often referred to as Blinkin, Spc105,
AF15Q14 and CASC5)11-13 is a predomi-
nantly intrinsically disordered protein that
forms part of the KNL1/Mis12/Ndc80
(KMN) network and functions as a dock-
ing platform for multiple substrates. For
instance, KNL1 C-terminal region inter-
acts with the Nsl1 and Dsn1 components
its
of
N-terminal region binds to the tetratrico-
peptide
(TPR) motif of Bub1 and
BubR1, an interaction that links the SAC
with the KMN network. Furthermore,
the N-terminal
region recruits Protein
Phosphatase 1 (PP1) to kinetochores, an
interaction that is required to silence the
SAC. Depletion of KNL1 of higher
organisms by RNAi causes severe chromo-

Bub1 and BubR1 protein exhaustion.11,15
The N-terminal of BubR1 is a domain
organized as a triple tandem arrangement
of the TPR motif, a protein motif defined
by a consensus of 34 amino acids that
are organized in a helix-loop-helix. The
three TPR units of BubR1 (and Bub1)
share features typical of other TPR motifs
such as the presence of small and large
hydrophobic residues located at specific
positions within the helix-loop-helix and
the assembly of the TPR units into a
relatively extended structure to form a
antiparallel a-helices

constant 24 degrees. The uniform arrange-
ment of neighboring a-helices gives rise to

architecture of the KNL1-BubR1 complex
shows unique features when compared
with the mode of
ligand binding of
TPRs that show high structure similarity
with TPR Bub1 and TPR BubR1
(Fig. 1A), the recurrent use of residues
defining the concave surface of structure-
related TPRs21 and the various roles of
Bub1 and BubR1 in SAC signaling22,23
suggest that TPRs of the latter proteins
might contain more than one protein
binding site (Fig. 1B). Such possibility
seems particularly attractive in the case of
BubR1 as its N-terminal region contains
a highly conserved KEN box motif that
is
binds Cdc20,
essential

complex.24-26 The N-terminal KEN box
motif is predicted to be located within a
region of low structural complexity that
precedes the TPR tandem arrangement.
Although it is unclear if, in addition to
BubR1 residues defining the KEN box
motif,
those defining the TPR motif
also participate in Cdc20 binding, some
recent reports lend support to this notion.

Mad2 and the APC/C. In contrast, BubR1
mutations

such as L126A and E161A/R165A do
not affect protein stability and are also
able to bind Cdc20, Mad2 and the APC/C
with the same affinity as the wild-type
protein. Because the A159W and F175G
mutations but not L126A and E161A/
R165A fail
to restore mitotic timing
defects upon BubR1 RNAi treatment, it
was suggested that KNL1 binding was
not
required for BubR1 kinetochore
localization or SAC function.27 This
interpretation is in conflict with our data
in which we have observed that single
substitution of BubR1 residues L126,
E161, and R165 by alanine weakened
the interaction but did not abolish it
completely.28 Our more recent yeast two-
hybrid data and peptide mapping analysis
coupled with ITC and mass spectrometry,
in vivo studies in stable cell lines, NMR
and X-ray crystallography lend further
to this notion.29 For instance,

the interaction of KNL1
(208–226) with TPR BubR1 is derived
from extensive
complementary hydro-
phobic interfaces implicating KNL1 resi-
dues I213, F215, F218, I219 and L222.
These residues define a novel motif (I213-

binding BubR1. KNL1 residue R221

of BubR1 binding to Cdc20.29 The fact

L142A still
localize to the kinetochore
and that these mutants bind KNL1 mimic

the kinetochore. We have proposed that
complex formation underlies a sequential
zipper or Velcro mechanism in which
KNL1 residues I213, F215, F218 and
I219 dock into the BubR1 pockets before
the residue R221 establishes a salt bridge
with BubR1 E107. An important implica-
tion of such cooperative interactions is
that they may lead to increased specificity
and more sensitive regulation.

An intriguing possibility is that upon
binding BubR1, Bub3 also contributes
to the interaction with KNL1. Such a
scenario would explain the early observa-
tion that a functional Bub3 binding site
is required for kinetochore localization of
BubR1.30 However, it is currently unclear
whether Bub3 makes direct contacts to
KNL1 or binds to another kinetochore

component. It can be anticipated that
advances in super-resolution microscopy
combined with defined point and dele-
tion mutations of BubR1 and other SAC
and kinetochore components will help to
determine the precise contribution of
TPR BubR1 and Bub3 in BubR1 kine-
tochore recruitment and the various roles
of BubR1 in the SAC.

Given the high structure

similarity
between Bub1 and BubR1 TPRs12,28 we
anticipated that KNL1 conserved hydro-
phobic residues I177, T179, F182 and
L186 of the Bub1 binding motif (I177-x-T-
x-x-F-L-x-x-L186) should define a similar
mode of interaction to that of BubR1-
KNL1 (Fig. 2). The crystal structure of
a Bub1-KNL1 complex reported more
recently (Protein Data Bank no. 4AIG)
confirmed the validity of our predictions.31

of tension.26,33 Given the proximity of the
PP1 binding site in KNL1 to that of the
Bubs binding region,34,35 it will be impor-
tant to determine if Bub1 and/or BubR1
are directly dephosphorylated at this site
and the role of such post-translational
modification in SAC silencing.

Closing Remarks

The organization of
the KNL1-BubR1
complex has provided structural details
of the communication between the SAC
and the kinetochore. It has revealed impor-
tant features of how molecular recognition
is achieved in this signaling system and
provided compelling evidence that
the
TPR motif is essential for BubR1 function
for the reasons we discussed previously.
The unique architecture of the KNL1-
BubR1 complex may assist the design and
development of low molecular mass com-
pounds able to interfere with protein–
protein interactions that are relevant to
the SAC. This in turn may represent new
opportunities for the treatment of cancer.
the molecular under-
standing of how the enrichment of Bub1
and BubR1 in the kinetochore affects
the interaction of KNL1 with Aurora B
kinase, protein phosphatase 1c, and micro-
tubules will provide important
insights
into the regulation of kinetochore-mitotic
checkpoint signaling. Future work should
aim to define the role of post-translational
modifications upon kinetochore composi-
tion, the regulation of its assembly, dis-
assembly and the interaction of KNL1
with microtubules and SAC components
in a temporal and spatial framework.

Bub1-KNL1 complex structures provide
detail of the molecular determinants of the
interaction such as the role of the TPR
convex surface in binding KNL1 and a
disorder-to-order transition of N-terminal
KNL1 upon Bubs binding. Such a mode
of binding should induce local conforma-
tional changes and modulate KNL1 inter-
action with other protein substrates. For
instance, the disorder to order transition
of KNL1 upon BubR1 binding may assist

the presentation of unbound flexible
regions of KNL1 to specific kinases
and/or phosphatases (Fig. 3). Binding of
TPR Bub1 to KNL1 may also lead to
