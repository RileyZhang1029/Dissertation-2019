Like other DNA viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replicates and proliferates in
host cells continuously modulating the host molecular environment. Following a sophis-
ticated temporal expression pattern, HSV-1 encodes at least 89 multifunctional proteins
that interplay with and modify the host cell proteome. During the last decade, advances
in mass spectrometry applications coupled to the development of proteomic separation
methods have allowed to partially monitor the impact of HSV-1 infection in human cells.
In this review, we discuss the current use of different proteome fractionation strategies
to deﬁne HSV-1 targets in two major application areas: (i) viral-protein interactomics to
decipher viral-protein interactions in host cells and (ii) differential quantitative proteomics
to analyze the virally induced changes in the cellular proteome. Moreover, we will also
discuss the potential application of high-throughput proteomic approaches to study global
proteome dynamics and also post-translational modiﬁcations in HSV-1-infected cells that
will greatly improve our molecular knowledge of HSV-1 infection.

INTRODUCTION
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a large, double stranded
DNA virus with a genome of 152 kbp that replicates in the nucleus
of the host cells and presents a unique genetic ﬂexibility (Tay-
lor et al., 2002). Its gene expression follows a temporal pattern
including three stages: immediate early (IE), early (E), and late
(L) genes (Clements et al., 1977). The process of infection begins
when the virions bind heparin sulfate moieties present on host cell
plasma membrane. Within the ﬁrst 30 min of infection, the initial
attachment triggers a cascade of molecular interactions involv-
ing multiple viral and host cell proteins and receptors, leading
to penetration of the viral nucleocapsid and tegument proteins
into the cytoplasm (Dohner et al., 2006). After penetration, viral
capsids and associated tegument proteins interact with dynein
and utilize the microtubule network to transit the cytosol to
the nuclear envelope, where they dock with nuclear pores and
release their genomes into the nucleus. The HSV-1 genome repli-
cation starts around 3–4 h post infection (hpi) reaching maximum
efﬁciency between 8 and 16 hpi (Phelan and Barklie Clements,
1997).

A large amount of information is available about the cellular
fate of viral proteins and their constitutive functions in infected
cells (Taylor et al., 2002). However, little is known about host
effectors involved in viral replication and their virally induced
functions, a crucial issue to understand the molecular pathogene-
sis of HSV-1 in human cells. This biological information is critical
to boost novel vaccines and treatments for the broad-spectrum
of pathological disorders caused by HSV-1 infection (Al-Dujaili
et al., 2011; Chisholm and Lopez, 2011;Rozenberg et al., 2011)
and also to promote the development of conditionally replicating
HSV-1 vectors expressing cellular genes as anticancer therapeutic

agents (Argnani et al., 2011; Shen and Nemunaitis, 2006; Nguyen
and Blaho, 2007). In spite of the different genomic approaches
carried out to understand the molecular alterations induced by
HSV-1 infection in different mammalian cells (Mossman et al.,
2001; Higaki et al., 2002; Paludan et al., 2002; Taddeo et al., 2002;
Ray and Enquist, 2004; Sun et al., 2004; Clement et al., 2008, 2009;
Zeier et al., 2009), changes in mRNA abundance do not always cor-
relate to changes at protein level (Tian et al., 2004). Proteomics,
therefore, is expected to provide a more extensive and complemen-
tary description of the cellular mechanisms altered upon HSV-1
infection. In this review, we focus on various protein fractionation
methods coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) previously used to
decipher novel HSV-1 targets. The results discussed here anticipate
the future impact of high-throughput proteomic applications in
the ﬁeld of HSV-1 biology.

HSV-1 PROTEIN INTERACTOME
In the last few years, LC–MS/MS analyses coupled to diverse
puriﬁcation steps has emerged as a powerful technique to eluci-
date viral proteins interactions with host proteome. In fact, some
immediate-early viral-protein interactomes have been partially
characterized (Figure 1). Using immunoprecipitation procedures
coupled to MS and validation techniques, Fontaine-Rodriguez
et al. (2004) identiﬁed eIF3 subunits p47 and p116, eIF4G, and
poly A binding protein as cellular interactors of ICP27 viral pro-
tein in human epidermoid (Hep-2) cells, suggesting that ICP27
may interfere in viral or host mRNA translation. Using a simi-
lar approach, Taylor and Knipe (2004) analyzed the interaction
partners of ICP8 in Hep-2 cells identifying over 50 cellular pro-
teins (and also some viral proteins) that coimmunoprecipitate or
localize with ICP8 in replication compartments. This potential

interactome was involved in different molecular function such as
transcription, replication and recombination, chromatin remod-
eling, and RNA splicing (Taylor and Knipe, 2004). More recently,
Lester and Deluca (2011) have isolated the ICP4-containing com-
plexes from HeLa-infected cells using tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation
(TAP-ICP4) and protein fractionation by 1D gel SDS-PAGE, iden-
tifying more than 40 cellular proteins present in theses complexes
by LC–MS/MS from which 11 and 4 proteins were components of
the transcription factor TFIID and the mediator complex respec-
tively. In this case, proteomic data were functionally validated by
immunoﬂuorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation exper-
iments showing that TFIID and mediator are recruited to viral pro-
moters as a function of ICP4 during infection (Lester and Deluca,
2011). On the other hand, more than 40 binary interactions have

been detected between capsid, envelope, and tegument viral pro-
teins using protein–protein interaction yeast two-hybrid system
(Bernhard et al., 2005; Vittone et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2008). Differ-
ent proteome composition of puriﬁed mature extracellular viruses
has been also characterized by MS-based proteomics technology.
The carefully developed workﬂow used by Loret et al. (2008)
allowed the identiﬁcation of 8 viral capsid proteins, 23 potential
tegument proteins, and 13 viral glycoproteins. In this workﬂow,
a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) approach was used to
detect speciﬁc viral glycoproteins in mature virion preparations.
Interestingly, 49 different host proteins mainly involved in trans-
port, cytoskeleton, and nucleotide binding were also accurately
identiﬁed. Although it is necessary to functionally validate the
presence of these host proteins in the extracellular virion structure,

these data clearly demonstrate that HSV-1 tegumentation may be
considered as a highly dynamic process.

PROTEOMIC PROFILING OF HSV-1-INFECTED CELLS
Comparative proteomic strategies have been also used in HSV-
1 research to elucidate host proteome modiﬁcations during the
early stages of HSV-1 infection (Figure 1). One of the most popu-
lar methods for protein separation is 2D-electrophoresis (2-DE).
Based on two independent biochemical characteristics of proteins,
it combines isoelectric focusing, which separates proteins accord-
ing to their isoelectric point (pI), and SDS-PAGE, which separates
them further according to their molecular mass (Westermeier and
Gorg, 2011). Using 35S labeling and 2-DE, Greco et al. (2000)
demonstrated that although a strong shutoff in protein synthe-
sis is induced in HSV-1 infection, the synthesis of some acidic
ribosomal proteins is sustained or even induced early in infec-
tion. On the other hand, Antrobus et al. identiﬁed more than 100
protein species differentially expressed between non-infected and
infected Hep-2 cells at 6 hpi. They used conventional 2-DE for
protein separation and MS for protein identiﬁcation. The host
proteins identiﬁed in this study participate in a plethora of bio-
logical process and some of them were validated by western-blot
analysis also in human diploid ﬁbroblast (HF) cells (Antrobus
et al., 2009).

Advanced prefractionation strategies in combination with MS,
have provided powerful means to enrich and analyze organelle-
speciﬁc subproteomes, obtaining valuable information that greatly
expand our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms altered dur-
ing HSV-1 infection. With the aim of detecting non-ribosomal
proteins associated to the ribosome that may contribute to the
HSV-1-induced translational control, Greco et al. extracted basic
proteins from the ribosomal fraction from mock-infected and
HSV-1-HeLa-infected cells. Using 35S, 2-DE, N-terminal sequenc-
ing, and MS, viral proteins such as VP19C and VP26, and host
poly(A) binding protein 1 were identiﬁed associated to ribo-
somes with different kinetics upon HSV-1 infection (Greco et al.,
2001). More recently, we have used complementary protein and
peptide labeling strategies to understand the dynamics of the
human hepatoma cell proteome behavior upon HSV-1 infection.
To increase the efﬁciency of proteomic analysis, Santamaría et
al. fractionated mock-infected and HuH7-infected cells to obtain
cytosolic and microsomal proteomes independently, at different
early time points of HSV-1 infection. After validating the efﬁ-
ciency of the enrichment procedure, proteome dynamics was
analyzed in both subcellular fractions by two-dimensional ﬂuo-
rescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). This approach
is based on direct labeling of lysine groups on proteins with
cyanine CyDye DIGE Fluor minimal dyes before isoelectric focus-
ing, enabling the labeling of two to three samples with different
dyes and electrophoresis of all the samples on the same 2D gel,
minimizing spot pattern variability and the number of gels in
an experiment (Tannu and Hemby, 2006). Using this approach,
16 unique deregulated host protein species mainly involved in
apoptosis, signal transduction, and endoplasmic reticulum associ-
ated degradation pathway were identiﬁed in HuH7-infected cells
by LC–MS/MS analyses (Santamaria et al., 2009). Interestingly,
three of these proteins (FK506-binding protein 4, hnRNPK and

eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 2) were also
deregulated early upon infection in Hep-2 cells (Antrobus et al.,
2009). These coincident proteins suggest that cellular mecha-
nisms involved in microtubule dynamics and mRNA processing
are common in infected cells with different origin indicating the
importance of these targets for HSV-1 infection. Santamaria et al.
(2009) demonstrated the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic
and different canonical signaling pathways identifying PP2A as
a pivotal target that may mediate the transduction of cell death
signals and promote cell survival pathway arrest in HuH7 cells.
In the near future, it would be interesting to study the speciﬁc
role of PP2A in different kind of cells infected with other HSV-1
strains to obtain robust conclusions. Moreover, deciphering the
potential interactome of PP2A together with phosphoproteome-
wide analysis of infected cells would increase our knowledge
about the speciﬁc role of phosphorylation in HSV-1-infected
cells.

Taking into account that HSV-1 replicates in the nucleus of
the host cells, Sanchez-Quiles et al. (2011) have combined 2D-
DIGE and tandem mass tag isobaric labeling (TMT) techniques
to analyze nuclear proteome alterations in HuH7-infected cells.
TMT is a liquid-based method that labels samples at the pep-
tide level (Dayon et al., 2008). While DIGE separates only soluble
proteins included in a pH range of 3–11 and a determined mol-
ecular weight, TMT can identify proteins outside these ranges.
Moreover, DIGE is able to detect differential post-translationally
modiﬁed proteins as well as different isoforms by resolving spots
at different pI and molecular weight. However, these isoforms
may not be distinguished with TMT approach, since labeling is
completed at the peptide level and most peptide sequences are
identical among a group of isoforms. In addition, proteins with
extreme isoelectric points, large molecular weights, low solubility
(hydrophobic proteins) and low copy numbers are poorly repre-
sented in 2D-DIGE experiments. The application of two different
proteomic strategies was particularly useful in obtaining comple-
mentary information, identifying 62 differential components of
the nuclear proteome of Huh7 hepatoma cells that may regulate
host–virus interaction, cell cycle regulation, and RNA homeosta-
sis upon infection (Sanchez-Quiles et al., 2011). In particular,
Lamin A–C, also differentially expressed in Hep-2 infected cells
(Antrobus et al., 2009), showed a complex differential isoform
pattern upon HSV-1 infection, suggesting regulatory mechanisms
based on post-translational modiﬁcation events. Interestingly, 32
host proteins were enriched in infected nuclei. One of these early
up-regulated proteins was protein quaking (QKI), involved in the
regulation of mRNA stability, nuclear retention, and RNA trans-
port (Galarneau and Richard, 2005). Using immunoﬂuorescence
assays, Sánchez-Quiles et al. have demonstrated that QKI-5 suf-
fers a time-dependent redistribution in infected cells, shuttling
from the nucleus to the cytosol upon HSV-1 infection. Inter-
estingly, QKI depletion by knockdown strategy induces a clear
delay in viral-protein synthesis, reducing the viral yield in infected
cells (Sanchez-Quiles et al., 2011). Although the viral necessity of
maintaining high expression levels of QKI during the infection
should be demonstrated as a possible global mechanism of HSV-1
interference with host cells, these data suggest that QKI may be a
potential target in the development of antiviral therapy.

Proteomic focus on HSV-1 infection

All differential proteins provided by proteomic studies have
undoubtedly extended our knowledge about HSV-1 infection at
the molecular level. However, the protein repertoires reported
are barely coincident. This variability is likely associated with
speciﬁc biological properties of the samples analyzed (differ-
ent cell lines, HSV-1 strains, and time point of infection used)
and the heterogeneity of the analytical procedures used (frac-
tionation methods to isolate speciﬁc organelles, and the use
of gel-based or gel free proteomic workﬂows). Although dif-
ferential proteomics has contributed to a better understanding
about the speciﬁc proteome changes that occur early in infec-
tion, additional research is needed to elucidate whether these
differentially expressed proteins are cellular targets used for HSV-
1 to modulate the host proteome or are part of molecular
events orchestrated by the cell to limit viral replication and
propagation.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Although 2D-electrophoresis has been the technique of choice
to monitor changes at protein level in HSV-1-infected cells, this
approach presents some inherent disadvantages such as many pro-
tein spots are likely comprised of multiple proteins, poor spot res-
olution at higher pI values, and the difﬁculty in electrophoresing
large and hydrophobic proteins in the ﬁrst dimension separa-
tion. However, the rapid advances in high-resolution MS-based
proteomics strategies may facilitate the global analysis of pro-
tein interacting partners of HSV-1 virion proteomes (Bailer and
Haas, 2009), host protein components in HSV-1-infected secre-
tome (Higa et al., 2008; Deng et al., 2010; Lietzen et al., 2011), and

also the detection, identiﬁcation, and quantitation of thousands
of novel HSV-1 targets in host cells to ﬁnally obtain an integra-
tive view of proteome modiﬁcations during the viral cycle. In the
near future, alternative proteomics methods such as SILAC (Ong
and Mann, 2006; Harsha et al., 2008) or stable isotope dimethyl
labeling (Boersema et al., 2009) will lead to more comprehensive
and time-dependent analysis of HSV-1-induced changes in host
proteomes. Nowadays, these high-throughput approaches have
been established and constantly optimized in order to improve
our understanding of phosphorylation events. Large-scale pro-
teomic studies based on SILAC in combination with strong cation
exchange (SCX) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) for phosphopep-
tide enrichment (Macek et al., 2009) would greatly contribute
to the study of phosphorylation dynamics in HSV-1-infected
cells. Using this shotgun approach, unexpected novel phospho-
rylation sites could be discovered in HSV-1 proteome, increasing
our biological knowledge about the activation/deactivation status
of multiple host signaling pathways during the infection. More-
over, the combination of immunoafﬁnity chromatography and
MS-based quantitative MS (Pan et al., 2011), will be a valuable
approach to characterize the glycoproteome of HSV-1-infected
cells and also to map the speciﬁc changes in glycosylation patterns
of HSV-1 surface proteins during the viral cycle. Finally, the appli-
cation of native and ion-mobility MS in the near future (Uetrecht
et al., 2011) will provide useful information about viral-protein
and protein-complex structure, conformation, stoichiometry of
an assembly, binding afﬁnities, and the topology of a viral-protein
complex (Uetrecht and Heck, 2011) increasing our knowledge on
structural HSV-1 biology.
