Abstract:  Appropriate  and  safe  antibacterial  agents  able  to  decontaminate  meat  surfaces  have  long  been  big  concern  of 
meat industry.  In an  attempt to manage beef  carcass  contamination, spray wash treatments utilizing three  concentrations 
(1, 1.5 and 2%) of acetic, lactic, propionic and formic acids were performed to evaluate their efficacy in reducing numbers 
of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus on meat tissues. The procured beef pieces of freshly slaughtered 
animals were decontaminated with hot water and then inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus individually which 
then were spray washed with organic acids separately. The total plate count of the treated samples showed that the popula-
tions  of  bacteria  decreased  after  being  exposed  to  organic  acids.  Spray  wash  of  formic  acid  resulted  in  the  highest  
reduction  of  both  bacterial  species  on  meat  surface.  Significantly,  higher  log  reductions  were  obtained  for  S.  aureus  
than  E.  coli  O157:H7.  It  was  concluded  that  organic  acids  are  highly  effective  in  decontaminating  meat  surfaces  and  
organic  acids  are  shown  to  be  safe,  simple,  efficient,  and  cheap  modality  of  meat  decontamination  which  can  be  highly 
recommended for industrial scales.

INTRODUCTION 

  The  contamination  of  sterile  animal  muscle  used  as  
food  is  a  direct  consequence  of  slaughtering  and  dressing  
of  animal  carcasses.  Wide  ranges  of  microorganisms  from 
different  sources  are  transferred  onto  meat  surfaces  that  
are  rich  in  nutrients  [1].  Hide,  hair,  and  hooves  of  the  
animals are some of the most widespread sources of bacterial  
contamination of animals’ carcass surfaces [2]. 

  Meat  can  harbour  a  large  number  of  pathogenic  and 
spoilage microorganisms during primary and further process-
ing.  The  number  of  microorganisms  on  fresh  meat  surfaces 
changes  during  chill  storage  following  a  typical  microbial 
growth  pattern.  Counts  of  bacteria  in  meat  are  in  the  range 
102-105  cfu/cm2,  but  only  around  10%  are  able  to  initiate 
growth  [3].  The  initial  lag  phase  is  attributed  to  microbial 
adaptation  to  changing  conditions  (chill  temperatures  and 
surface desiccation). Ensuing logarithmic growth takes place 
after  cells  have  accommodated  to  the  new  environmental 
setting and adapted their metabolism. When numbers exceed 
l07  cells  per  cm2,  the  first  spoilage  signs  are  detected,  as  
off-odours.  Another  typical  spoilage  sign,  bacterial  slime,  is 
noticeable with cell density around l08 cells per cm2 [4].

  Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus are 
some of the most frequent pathogens  that contaminate  meat. 
E.  coli  O157:H7  contaminate  meat  by  contact  with  sewage, 
or  contaminated  skin  and  equipment  during  slaughtering.  S. 
aureus can also be transferred to the surface of carcass from 
various  sources  such  as  skin  of  cattle,  hide,  equipment  and 
infected personnel [5].  

  The involvement of E. coli O157:H7 foodborne illnesses 
and  S.  aureus  food  poisoning  outbreaks  has  been  associated 
with  the consumption of  meat  and meat products,  especially 
undercooked  ground  beef  [5].  Meat  pathogens  can  cause 
self-limiting  human  enteric  diseases  or  systemic  and  fatal 
infections  of  the  immunocompromised,  the  elderly,  and  the 
young [1]. 

  E.  coli  O157:H7  is  a  Gram  negative,  facultative  anaer-
obe, non-sporeforming rod shape bacterium. Diseases caused 
by  E.  coli  O157:H7  vary  from  non-bloody  diarrhea  and 
bloody  diarrhea  through  haemorrhagic  colitis  [6].  S.  aureus 
is  a  facultative  anaerobe,  non-motile,  spherical,  Gram-
positive  bacterium.  Nausea,  vomiting,  retching,  abdominal 
cramping,  and  prostration  are  the  most  common  symptoms 
of S. aureus food poisoning [7]. 

  With  respect  to  health  and  economic  problems  caused  
by  these  bacteria,  it  is  very  important  to  reduce  the  initial  
microbial  population  on  meat.  Various  intervention  strate-
gies  have  been  developed  to  reduce  the  level  of  bacteria  on

surface  of  animals’  carcass  such  as  washing  and  sanitizing 
with hot water, chlorinated water, food grade acids and salts 
[8, 9].  

  Organic  acids  are  generally  recognized  as  safe  (GRAS) 
antimicrobial  agents,  and  the  dilute  solutions  of  organic  
acids  (1-3%)  are  generally  without  effect  on  desirable  
sensory  properties  of  meat  when  used  as  a  carcass  decon-
taminant [9, 10]. 

 
Previous  studies  focused  on  limited  treatments  for  con-
trolling  bacteria  in  which  results  were  inconsistent  because 
of  the  extensive  variations  in  conditions  of  experiments. 
Therefore,  this  study  attempted  to  compare  the  antibacterial 
effect of  large number of different  treatments,  three concen-
trations  of  four  most  frequently  used  organic  acids  in  previ-
ous  studies  as  acetic,  lactic,  propionic  and  formic  acids,  on 
some  important  species  of  bacteria  on  meat.  The  objective  
of  this  research  was  to  study  and  compare  the  antibacterial 
effect  of  the  studied  acids  at  three  concentrations  (1,  1.5  
and  2%)  on  the  inoculated  bacteria,  E.  coli  O157:H7  and  
S. aureus, on meat at 4±1ºC. 

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY  

Organic Acids 

  Three  concentrations  (1,  1.5  and  2%)  of  four  types  of 
food  grade  organic  acids  namely  Acetic  Acid  (100%)  (AA), 
L-Lactic  Acid  (90%)  (LA),  Propionic  Acid  (99%)  (PA)  and 
Formic  Acid  (90%)  (FA)  (Merck,  Germany)  were  prepared 
by  diluting  of  glacial  form  of  the  acids  in  sterile  distilled 
water (DW).  

Meat Preparation  

 
Fresh  meat  was  obtained  from  a  local  butchery  in  
Serdang,  Selangor,  Malaysia.  Having  been  packed  in  sterile 
bags,  the  meat  was  transported  to  laboratory  in  a  cool  box. 
The  samples  were  prepared  immediately  after  transferring 
meat  to  laboratory.  Several  10-gram  pieces  of  meats  were 
procured from freshly slaughtered cow. 

Bacterial Strains 

  Escherichia  coli  O157:H7  ATCC  888402  and  Staphylo-
coccus  aureus  ATCC  29247  were  obtained  from  the  
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).  

SAMPLE PREPARATION  

  Each  species  of  bacteria  was  cultured  on  standard  plate 
count agar (Merck, Germany) and was then incubated for 24 
hours  at  37ºC.  After  24  hours  of  incubation,  a  number  of 
colonies were  inoculated in sterile DW, and the cell concen-
tration was adjusted to about 103 bacteria/ml.  

  The  prepared  10-gram  pieces  of  meat  were  decontami-
nated by washing with hot sterile DW (80ºC) for 30 seconds, 
then they were kept for few minutes to reach room tempera-
ture. At this stage,  about 103 bacteria/ml of E. coli O157:H7 
and  S.  aureus  were  inoculated  individually  on  decontami-
nated  meat  by  pouring  and  swabbing  over  the  meats  
surfaces.  Subsequently,  the  inoculated  meats  with  selected 
bacteria  were  kept  for  20  minutes  to  allow  attachment  and 

Raftari et al. 

absorption  of  bacteria  however;  some  of  the  inoculated 
meats were kept as an inoculation control. 

  After 20  minutes,  the inoculated  meat was spray washed 
with  organic  acids  for  15  seconds  individually.  Once  the 
inoculated  meat  was  spray  washed  and  drained,  they  were 
packed in sterile bags that were stored at 4±1ºC. Another set 
was also prepared at the same time as a replicate.  

  Microbiological  analyses  were  carried  out  immediately 
after  spray  washing  until  the  12th  day  of  refrigeration.  The 
surface pH of samples was measured by using flat probe pH 
meter  (Prescisa,  Switzerland)  on  0,  2nd,  6th  and  12th  days  of 
storage.  At  this  step,  each  piece  of  meat  (10  g)  was  asepti-
cally  blended  with  90  ml  of  sterile  peptone  water  (Merck, 
Germany)  in  a  laboratory  blender.  After  that,  1  ml  of  the 
blended  sample  of  each  inoculated  meat  with  E.  coli 
O157:H7 and S. aureus was transferred onto Petri dishes for 
pour  plate  culturing  with  standard  plate  count  agar  (Merck, 
Germany)  individually.  Again,  another  one  ml  of  the  same 
suspension  was  cultured  as  a  duplicate.  The  Petri  dishes  
were  then  incubated  for  24  hours  at  37ºC.  After  24  hours  
of  incubation,  the  number  of  colonies  was  enumerated  in 
each Petri dish.  

Statistical Analysis  

  The  bacterial  population  (CFU  gr-1)  was  obtained  from 
four replications performed on separate days and their means 
were converted  to log10 CFU gr-1. Differences between log10 
CFU gr-1 of untreated beef carcass  tissue and  log10 CFU gr-1 
of treated beef carcass tissue were calculated as log reduction 
[11,  12].  Log  reductions  of  treatments  were  compared  by 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test using the general  linear 
models  of  SPSS  12.0  for  windows,  P  value  <  0.05  was  
considered as significant.  

RESULTS 

  The  total  plate  count  of  treated  samples  showed  that  
all  treatments  had  lethal  effect  on  both  pathogenic  bacteria. 
The  initial  surface  pH  of  meat  decreased  directly  after  
spray  washing  with  treatments.  With  progress  of  storage,  
it  increased  (Table  1  and  2,  Figs.  1  and  2)  while  the  pH  
of  untreated  meat  decreased.  The  population  of  E.  coli 
O157:H7 (Figs. 3 A-D) and S. aureus (Figs. 4 A-D) reduced 
after  being  exposed  to  all  treatments.  The  mean  log  reduc-
tions  of  E.  coli  O157:H7  and  S.  aureus  showed  in  Table  1 
and 2 respectively.  

  The reduction of selected bacteria showed that they were 
sensitive  to all  treatments but  the antibacterial effect of AA, 
LA,  PA  and  FA  were  different.  Analysis  of  variance 
(ANOVA)  of  E.  coli  O157:H7  and  S.  aureus  showed  that 
there  is  no  significant  difference  (P  <  0.05)  between  lethal 
effect  of  AA,  LA  and  PA,  but  there  was  significant  differ-
ence  between  antibacterial  effects  of  FA  and  other  treat-
ments. Interestingly FA showed the best lethal effect on both 
pathogenic bacteria in this study.  

  The  results  showed,  in  addition  on  type  of  acid,  the  
concentration  also  plays  an  important  role  in  reducing  the 
number  of  bacteria.  Analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  for  log 
reduction  of  E.  coli  O157:H7  and  S.  aureus  showed  that

there  was  significant  difference  (P<0.05)  between  1,  1.5  
and  2%  concentrations  of  each  organic  acid.  According  to 
the  results  the  inhibitory  effect  of  2%  concentration  >1.5% 
concentration >1% concentration.  

  The untreated meat showed no significant changes in the 
populations  of  E.  coli  O157:H7  and  S.  aureus  at  pH  ranges 
6.18-5.17 and 6.12-4.86 respectively. 

  The  Mean  log  reduction  of  S.  aureus  exposed  to  FA  at 
concentrations of 1, 1.5 and 2% was similar to each other but 
they might be distinguished by three way interaction analysis 
(acid  (cid:1) concentration  (cid:1) day). Three-way interaction analysis 
showed  that  these  treatments  had  different  log  reductions 
levels on different days. FA  at 1, 1.5 and 2% concentrations 
reached to 3.16 log10 cfu/gr on 8th, 7th and 5th days of storage 
respectively.  

  Analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  of  log  reductions  of  
both  bacteria  indicated  that  there  is  a  significant  difference 
(P < 0.05) between log reductions of S. aureus and that of E. 
coli  O157:H7.  A  comparison  between  the  log  reductions  of 
E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus after being exposed to various 
treatments  was  shown  in  Fig.  (5).  The  mean  log  reductions 
of S. aureus and E. coli O157:H7 showed that S. aureus was 
more sensitive to organic acids than E. coli O157:H7.  

DISCUSSION 

  The  main  goal  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  
antibacterial  effect  of  various  organic  acids  applied  as  
spray  wash  treatment  and  explore  their  effect  on  decreasing 
the microbial  loads of bacteria  efficiently on beef tissue. PH 
is  one  of  the  important  factors,  which  influences  the  growth 
of  bacteria.  It  has  been  well  established  that  most  microor-
ganisms grow best at pH values around 7.0 [5], therefore, pH 
reduction  is  one  of  the  inhibitor  factors,  which  can  limit  the 
growth  of  bacteria.  It  was  indicated  that  direct  bactericidal 
action  of  organic  acids  results  from  pH  decrease  within  
bacterial  cell  and  it  was  also  observed  that  pH  of  fish  meal 
decreased  directly  after  acid  addition  which  resulted  in  
reduction  of  E.  coli  O157:H7  population  [13].  Moreover, 
another  study  found  that  the  bacteriostatic  effect  of  pro- 
pionate  against  E.  coli  was  proportional  to  pH  decrease  in 
culture medium [14]. 

  To date, organic acids have been found as safe antibacte-
rial agents. Various researchers have proved the antibacterial 
effect  of  organic  acids  on  different  types  of  pathogenic  
bacteria [11, 15, 16]. 

 
In  this  study,  the  population  of  E.  coli  O157:H7  and  S. 
aureus  decreased  after  being  exposed  to  all  treatments.  The 
reduction  rate  of  the  selected  bacteria  was  proportional  to

the  type  and  the  concentration  of  each  organic  acid.  Log  
reductions analysis showed that increase in the concentration 
of organic acids resulted in increasing the antibacterial effect 
of organic acids. These findings are similar to that of another 
study  [17]  that  scrutinized  the  reduction  in  the  microbial 
population of E. coli and S. typhimurium when exposed to 1, 
2  and  3%  concentrations  of  lactic  acid.  They  found  that 
population reduction of E. coli rose by increasing concentra-
tion of lactic acid.  

  The antibacterial effect of the organic acids was found to 
be caused mainly by the undissociated form of organic acids 
[18].  Non-dissociated  organic  acids  can  passively  diffuse 
through a bacterium’s cell wall and once internalized into the 
neutral pH of  the cell  cytoplasm,  they dissociate into  anions 
and  protons,  both  of  which  exert  an  inhibitory  effect  on  
bacteria [19]. Releasing proton ions causes the internal pH to 
decrease  leading  to  disruption  of  proton  motive  force,  and 
inhibiting substrate transport mechanisms [20, 21].  

  The  findings  of  the  current  study  showed  that  FA  treat-
ment  was  the  most  effective  in  reducing  the  population  
of  selected  bacteria.  These  results  were  in  agreement  with 
that  of  another  study  [22]  which  indicated  that  formic  acid 
showed  stronger  lethal  effect  on  Campylobacter  jejuni  than 
propionic  and  acetic  acids.  The  strong  antibacterial  effect  
of  formic  acid  is  related  to  its  structure.  Formic  acid  is  an 
organic  acid  with  shortest  chain,  which  could  be  beneficial 
for  its  diffusion  into  the  cell  and  cause  acidification  of  the 
cytoplasm [23].  

In addition, analysis of log reductions of E. coli O157:H7 
 
and  S.  aureus  showed  that  the  effect  of  organic  acids  was 
more  pronounced  in  S.  aureus,  which  is  a  Gram-positive 
bacterium,  than  in  E.  coli  O157:H7,  which  is  a  Gram-
negative  bacterium.  It  was  reported  that  the  population  of 
Clostridium  perfringens  decreased  more  than  E.  coli  and 
Salmonella  sp.,  in  cultures  exposed  to  treatments  [23].  The 
higher  sensitivity  of  gram-positive  bacteria  to  different  
kinds  of  antibacterial  agents  can  be  related  to  the  structure  
of  the  cell  wall  of  this  group.  Gram-positive  bacteria  do  
not  possess  an  outer  membrane,  hence  preservatives  can  

easily  enter  these  cells  and  their  intrinsic  resistance  is  
relatively low [24].  

CONCLUSION  

  Taken  together  the  population  of  E.  coli  O157:H7  and  
S.  aureus  decreased  after  being  exposed  to  AA,  LA,  PA  
and  FA  treatments.  Among  the  treatments,  FA  showed  
the  best  antibacterial  effect  on  both  bacteria.  In  addition, 
these  results  indicated  that  S.  aureus  was  more  sensitive  
to  organic  acids 
than  E.  coli  O157:H7.  Collectively,  
formic  acid  treatment  is  a  feasible  and  economical  method  
of decontaminating meat.
