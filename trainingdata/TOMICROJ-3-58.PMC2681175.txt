Abstract: Microbial  communities in an  acidic hot spring, namely  Kawah Hujan B,  at Kamojang geothermal  field,  West 
Java-Indonesia  was  examined  using  culture  dependent  and  culture  independent  strategies.  Chemical  analysis  of  the  hot 
spring  water  showed  a  characteristic  of  acidic-sulfate  geothermal  activity  that  contained  high  sulfate  concentrations  and 
low pH values (pH 1.8 to 1.9). Microbial community present in the spring was characterized by 16S rRNA gene combined 
with  denaturing  gradient  gel  electrophoresis  (DGGE)  analysis.  The  majority  of  the  sequences  recovered  from  culture-
independent method were closely related to Crenarchaeota and Proteobacteria phyla. However, detail comparison among 
the  member  of  Crenarchaeota  showing  some  sequences  variation  compared  to  that  the  published  data  especially  on  the 
hypervariable and variable regions. In addition, the sequences did not belong to certain genus. Meanwhile, the 16S rDNA 
sequences from culture-dependent samples revealed mostly close to Firmicute and gamma Proteobacteria.  

Key Words: Kamojang, thermophiles, 16S rRNA, DGGE, microbial diversity.  

INTRODUCTION 

  Molecular  studies  of  geothermal  ecosystems  have  pro-
vided  many  illuminating  discoveries  of  microbial  diversity. 
Culturing  methods  and  molecular  studies  have  uncovered  a 
remarkable  diversity  of  both  bacteria  and  archaea  in  hot 
springs worldwide. Microbes that are metabolically active in 
extremely thermoacidic environments have attracted for their 
unique  ecology  and  physiology  as  well  as  sources  of  heat 
and acid stable biocatalysts [1]. Solfataric fields are the most 
important  biotopes  thermoacidophilic  microbes.  Most  of 
thermoacidophilic  microbes  that  usually  lived  in  solfataric 
fields  belong  to  the  archaea  including  the  genera Acidianus, 
Desulfurolobus,  Metallosphaera,  Stygiolobus,  Sulfolobus, 
Sulfurisphaera,  Sulfurococcus,  Thermoplasma,  and  Picro-
philus  [1].  Microbes  belong  to  bacteria  were  also  found  
including  Acidithiobacillus,  Acidimicrobium,  Sulfobacillus 
and  Hydrogenobaculum  genera  [2,  3].  These  chemolithotro-
phic  acidophiles  often  are  the  predominant  primary  produc-
ers  and  may  also  contribute  to  iron  and  sulfur  cycling  via 
oxidization of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds [2-4]. 

  The  presence  of  diverse  acidophilic  populations  in  
both  natural  and  man-made  acidic  environments  has  been 
demonstrated  by  cultivation-dependent  and  -independent 
approaches  [5-8].  However, 
the  studies  of  microbial  
community  from  Indonesian  geothermal  fields  are  very  
limited  [9,  10].  Indonesia  is  a  country  with  a  number  of

volcanoes and a lot of geothermal area. There are at least 120 
volcanic  centers  that  are  spread  over  volcanic  belts  of  7000 
km  along  the  Indonesian  islands  [11].  Kamojang  is  one  of 
these geothermal fields that located in West Java, Indonesia, 
at  an  altitude  of  1500  m.  The  Kamojang  geothermal  field  is 
the first operational geothermal field for electricity power in 
Indonesia [12].  

  The  Kamojang  geothermal  field  is  vapor-dominated  but 
the  hydrothermal  minerals  show  that  the  rock-altering  fluid 
were dominantly liquid. The primary minerals present in the 
Kamojang  subsurface  rock  samples  are  mainly  feldspar  
(andesine-labradorite),  pyroxene  (hypersthene  and  augite), 
and  olivine  (forsterite).  In  general,  the  primary  minerals  in 
the andesite lavas are less altered than those in the pyroclas-
tic  rocks.  There  are  two  distinctive  hydrothermal  mineral  
assemblages  at  Kamojang,  namely  the  acid  and  the  neutral 
assemblages,  which  occur  in  shallower  and  deeper  levels, 
respectively.  The  acid  assemblage  occupies  the  shallower 
level of the system (from near  surface down  to 100-300 m), 
and  is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  kaolin  with  or  with-
out  smectite,  alunite,  quartz,  cristobalite,  and  pyrite.  The 
deeper,  neutral  assemblages,  comprises  quartz,  adularia,  
albite,  epidote, 
laumontite,  calcite, 
siderite,  titanohematite,  pyrite,  anhydrite,  smectite,  chlorite, 
illite, and interlayer clays [13].

  The  surface  manifestations  in  the  Kamojang  area  consist 
of  hot  pools,  fumaroles,  mud  pots  and  hot  springs  lying  in 
the so called Kawah Kamojang thermal area. Most of the hot 
surface  water  contains  high  concentration  of  sulfate  (1000-
2000  ppm)  but  low  concentrations  of  chloride  (<  5  ppm) 
[14]. The isotopic evidence suggests that the water was local

hydrogen  sulfide,  which  oxidizes  to  sulfuric  acid  to  give  
water of a low pH and high sulfate concentration [13].  

  Here  we  report  the  microbial  community  analysis  of  
the  acidic  hot  spring,  namely  Kawah  Hujan  B  at  Kamojang 
Geothermal  Area,  West  Java,  Indonesia.  The  analysis  was 
based  on  culture-independent  and  culture-dependent  strate-
gies  to  get  a  first  insight  into  the  microbial  communities  in 
this acidic ecosystem. PCR amplification and DGGE separa-
tion  of  rRNA  gene  fragments  were  used  to  profile  the  
microbial communities. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Site and Sample Collection 

  The  Kamojang  geothermal  field  is  located  in  West  
Java  Province,  Indonesia,  about  35  km  south  of  Bandung. 
Kawah Hujan B (E 107°48’14.38”, N -7°8’21.7”, the altitude 
1690  m)  is  one  of  the  hot  springs  in  Kamojang  Geothermal 
field.  The  hot  spring  is  an  acidic-sulfate  mud  pot.  Water 
samples  were  collected  in  June  2006.  For  assessing  micro-
bial  diversity  by  culture-independent  method,  water  sample 
was  filtered  through  a  0.22-(cid:1)m-pore-size  cellulose  mem-
brane  filter  (Sartorius,  Germany)  within  4  h  after  sampling. 
The  cells  on  membrane  were  re-suspended  in  25  ml  of  STE 
buffer  (10  mM  Tris-HCl  [pH  8.0],  0.1  M  NaCl,  1  mM 
EDTA)  and  precipitated  by  centrifugation.  Pellet  containing 
microbial  communities  were  stored  at  -20°C  until  DNA  ex-
tracted.  Cultivation  process  was  carried  out  by  incubating 
spring  water  at  70oC  after  added  by  nutrients.  Two  nutrient 
composition  were  used  as  enrichment  media,  namely  
P (0.1% (w/v) peptone), and T (0.25% (w/v) tryptone; 0.25% 
(w/v) NaCl; 0.125% (w/v) yeast extract) media.  

Geophysico-Chemical Analysis 

 
pH and  temperature were measured in June 2006.  Meas-
urement  of  cations  concentration  was  performed  using 
Atomic  Absorption  Spectroscopy/AAS  (GBC  Avanta  Ver. 
2.02)  method  and  anions  concentration  was  determined  by 
titration, turbidimetry, spectrophotometry methods. 

Bead Beating-Based DNA Extraction 

  The  pellet  containing  microbial  cells  were  mixed  with 
DNA extraction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 100 mM 
sodium  EDTA  [pH  8.0],  100  mM  sodium  phosphate  [pH 
8.0], 1.5 M NaCl), glass beads and proteinase K (10 mg/ml) 
in microcentrifuge tubes by vortexing (Genie, G 560E, USA) 
at  medium  vigorous  (half  of  maximum  speed)  for  15  min  
at  room  temperature.  After  mixing,  20%  SDS  was  added, 
and  the  samples  were  incubated  at  65°C  for  2  h  with  gentle 
end-over-end  inversions  every  15  to  20  min.  Supernatants 
were  mixed  with  an  equal  volume  of  chloroform  isoamylal-
cohol  (24:1,  v/v).  The  aqueous  phase  was  recovered  by  
centrifugation  and  precipitated  with  0.6  volume  of  isopro-
panol  at  room  temperature  for  1  h.  The  pellet  of  crude  
nucleic acids were obtained by centrifugation at 16.000 g for 
20  min  at  room  temperature,  washed  twice  with  cold  70% 
ethanol, and resuspended in sterile deionized water. 

Lysozyme-Based DNA Extraction 

  The pellet cells was suspended in 10 mM Tris HCl buffer 
(pH  8.0)  containing  8  mg/ml  of  lysozyme  and  incubated  

at  37°C  for  1  h,  the  cells  were  lysed  by  adding  lysis  buffer 
containing  2%  SDS,  0.8  mg/ml  proteinase  K  and  200  mM 
EDTA pH 8.0.  The  lysis process was  carried out by incuba-
tion  at  50°C  for  30  min.  Ice  cold  potassium  acetate  and  
acetic  acid  glacial  mixed  solution  were  added  and  the  dena-
tured  proteins  were  precipitated  by  centrifugation.  Super-
natants  were  mixed  with  an  equal  volume  of  chloroform 
isoamylalcohol  (24:1,  v/v).  The  aqueous  phase  was  recov-
ered  by  centrifugation  and  precipitated  with  0.6  volume  of 
isopropanol at room temperature for 1 h. The pellet of crude 
nucleic acids were obtained by centrifugation at 16.000 g for 
20  min  at  room  temperature,  washed  twice  with  cold  70% 
ethanol, and resuspended in sterile deionized water. 

Amplification of 16S rRNA Gene Fragments 

  The amplification of partial 16S rRNA genes was carried 
out  as  described  previously  by  Ferris  [15].  A  set  of  primers 
were used to amplify about 323-bp section of the 16S rRNA 
genes  of  members  of  the  domain  Bacteria,  including  the 
highly variable V7-V8 region [16]. One primer complements 
a  region  conserved  among  members  of  the  domain  Bacteria 
(Escherichia  coli  positions  1055  to  1070;  primer  sequence 
5’ATGGCTGTCGTCAGCT-3’).  The  other  primer  is  based 
on  a  universally  conserved  region  (E.  coli  positions  1392  to 
1406;  5’CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGGCCCGCCG 
CCCCCGCCCCACGGGCGGTGTGTAC-3’)  and  incorpo-
rates  a  40-base  GC  clamp.  The  specificity  of  this  primer  is 
imparted by the underlined region. PCRs were performed by 
using cloned Taq DNA polymerase according to the instruc-
tions provided by the manufacturer (Promega). The tempera-
ture cycle for the PCR was 1 min of denaturizing at 94°C,  1 
min  of  annealing,  and  1  min  of  primer  extension  at  72°C. 
During an initial touchdown cycle, the annealing temperature 
was  continually  decreased  from  53  to  43°C  in  intervals  
of  1°C  per  cycle;  20  additional  annealing  cycles  were  
performed  at  43°C.  The  final  primer  extension  was  for  10 
min at 72°C.  

DGGE and re-PCR of DGGE Bands 

  DGGE  was  performed  by  using  D-code  systems  
(Bio-Rad  Laboratories)  with  a  1.5-mm  gel.  Approximately 
100- to 500-ng portions of PCR products were used directly 
onto  8%  (w/v)  polyacrylamide  gels  with  denaturing  gradi-
ents  from  30  to  40%  (100%  denaturant  was  7  M  urea  
and  40%  [v/v]  deionized  formamide).  Electrophoresis  was 
performed  with  0.5X  TAE  buffer  (20  mM  Tris-acetate,  0.5 
mM  EDTA)  at  200  V  and  60°C  for  4  h.  After  electrophore-
sis,  the  gels  were  stained  with  silver  staining  method  [5]. 
Each band in  the DGGE gel was excised with a razor blade, 
added with TE buffer (10mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA), placed 
in boiling water for 5 minutes, and then incubated overnight 
at  37°C.  The  eluted  DNA  was  amplified  using  the  same 
primers  as  previous  amplification  but  without  GC  clamp 
sequence. PCRs were performed at the following conditions: 
an initial denaturizing step at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 
cycles of 1 min  at 94°C, 1 min  at 50°C, and 1 min at 72°C, 
and a final extension step of 10 min at 72°C. All of confirm 
DGGE  bands  were  subjected  to  DNA  sequencing.  Sequenc-
ing  was  carried  out  in  an  ABI  PrismR  3100  Genetic  
Analyzer (Applied  Biosystems) by  the  Macrogen Sequencing 
Service (Korea).

Phylogenetic Analysis 

  The  sequencing  results  were  compared  to  16S  rRNA 
gene  sequences  from  GenBank  database  at  NCBI  (National 
Centre  of  Biotechnological  Information)  through  web  site 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov using BLAST program [17] for 
screening of sequence similarity. Sequences alignments were 
performed  by  ClustalW  program  [18].  Aligning  sequences 
were visualized using GenDoc program. Phylogenetic recon-
struction  was  accomplished  with  the  phylogeny  inference 
package  (PHYLIP  version  3.62).  Evolutionary  distances 
were calculated by F84 method with the DNADIST program 
[19].  Phylogenetic  trees  were  constructed  from  distance  
matrices  by  the  neighbor-joining  method  [20],  which  was 
implemented  with  the  NEIGHBOR  program.  The  node  re-
producibility  for  tree  topology  was  estimated  by  bootstrap 
analysis,  which  included  1000  replicate  data  sets.  The  trees 
were  visualized  by  Treev32  program.  Sequences  were 
checked 
the  CHECK_CHIMERA  
program of the Ribosomal Database Project [21].

culture-independent  (filtration)  sample,  while  chromosomal 
DNA  from  culture-dependent  (cultivation)  samples  were 
performed  only  by  bead  beating-based  method.  PCR  ampli-
fications  of  16S  rRNA  gene  fragments  were  successfully 
carried out for both filtration and cultivation samples. All of 
amplification  results  produced  a  single  band  in  agarose  gel 
electrophoresis with the size of approximately 400 bps.  

  DGGE  profile  of  16S  rRNA  gene  fragments  performed 
by filtration samples obtained from different cell lysis meth-
ods showed a different pattern. The different DGGE profiles 
were also performed by cultivation samples. Most of intense 
bands were  appeared at  the upper  and lower sides of the gel 
(Fig. 1). However, some thin bands at the middle side of the 
gel  were  appeared  on  the  filtration  sample  by  enzymatically 
lysed  and  culture  sample  grown  in  P  medium.  Bands  at  the 
upper  side  of  the  gel  showed  a  similar  pattern.  Most  of  the 
DGGE bands were successfully re-amplified  and sequenced. 
The  sequences  estimated  as  chimeric  artifact  were  excluded 
from further analysis.

Phylogenetic and Diversity of Community 

  Microbial community present in acidic-sulfate containing 
hot  spring  was  characterized  by  16S  rRNA  gene  fragment 
analysis.  The  majority  of  the  sequences  recovered  from  fil-
tration  sample  obtained  by  enzymatic-based  cell  lyses 
method  were  affiliated  with  the  Crenarchaeota  phylum,  and 

Microbial Diversity in Kamojang Geothermal Field

only  one  sequence  was  closed  to  Pseudomonas  genus  be-
longing  to  Proteobacteria  phylum  (Fig.  2).  While  the  se-
quences  recovered  from  filtration  sample  obtained  by  bead-
beating method were performed slightly different lineage on 
phylogenetic  tree  (Fig.  3).  Sequences  affiliated  with  the 
Crenarchaeota were minority  in filtrated sample obtained by 
bead-beating  method.  Most  of  sequences  were  close  to 
gamma  Proteobacteria  group 
including  Aeromonas, 
Xenorhabdus, and Enterobacter genera. In phylogenetic tree, 
the  sequences  closed  to  Crenarchaeota  showed  clustering  in 
a distinct branch (Fig. 2).  

  Detail  alignment  of  the  sequences  to  closely  related  se-
quences  from  database  showed  that  the  sequences  belonged 
to  Crenarchaeota  group  showed  many  bases  substitution 
compared  to  that  the  sequences  available  in  the  GenBank 
database  (Fig.  4A).  Sequences  variations  were  observed 
throughout the region that  lied in the variable region as well 
as conserved region. Variation sequences were also observed 
on the sequences that closed to gamma Proteobacteria group. 
However, most of the differences were laid in the V7 and V8 
hypervariable region (Fig. 4B), particularly for the sequences 
closed to Aeromonas genus. Meanwhile the sequences closed 
to  Pantoea/Enterobacter  genus  had  relatively  similar  se-
quences  compared  to  that  the  sequences  available  in  the 
GenBank database (data not shown). 

  Microbial  diversities  from  the  cultivation  samples  were 
mostly  different  with  the  filtration  sample.  The  sequences 
recovered  from  cultivation  in  P  medium  revealed  as  gamma 
Proteobacteria.  Most  of  them  were  affiliated  to  Pan-
toea/Enterobacter genus, three sequences performed distinct 
cluster  with  other  known  microbes,  and  one  sequences 
closed  to  Pseudomonas  (Fig.  5).  While,  most  of  the  se-
quences detected in T  medium were closed to Alicyclobacil-

lus,  and  only  one  sequence  was  affiliated  with  gamma  pro-
teobacterium (Fig. 6).  

  Detail  alignment  for  the  sequence  close  to Pseudomonas 
genus  revealed  slightly  differences  with  other  sequences 
from the GenBank database. Most of sequence variation lied 
in  variable  region  and  one  nucleotide  difference  detected  in 
conserved  region.  While  detail  alignment  for  the  sequences 
obtained  from  T  medium  that  closed  to  Alicyclobacillus 
showed  sequence  variation,  particularly  in  V7  and  V8  hy-
pervariable region (Fig. 7).  

DISCUSSION 

  The  Kawah  Hujan  B  of  Kamojang  geothermal  filed  is  a 
stressfull,  natural  environment  with  an  extremely  low  pH, 
high  temperature  and  high  load  of  sulfate  ion.  Investigation 
of  microbial  diversity  using  culture-dependent  and  culture-
independent  revealed 
the  microbes  from  culture-
dependent were belong to  Crenorchoeota and Proteobacteria 
phyla while from culture-dependent belong to Firmicute and 
gamma Proteobacteria. 

that 

  The  present  of  Crenorchaeota  in  Kawah  Hujan  B  was 
predicted since these organisms frequently found in extreme 
environment  [22,  23].  Some  species  of  Crenorchaeota  are 
thermoacidophile  growing  in  environment  with  high  sulfate 
concentration  [22].  Crenorchaeota  was  aerob,  facultative 
anearob, and anaerob, chemoorganotroph and lithotroph, and 
able to use sulphur as energy source in their metabolism [24, 
25].  In  this  experiment,  most  of  microbes  detected  by  cul-
ture-independent  strategy  were  archaea  suggesting  that  the 
Kawah  Hujan  B  was  suitable  habitat  for  these  microbes.  A 
few reports showed that archaea were predominant microbes 
on the environments with extreme temperature (>90°C) [26], 
and  most  of  thermoacidophile  archaea  were  belonging  to

Crenorchaeota  phylum  [27].  Furthermore,  some  hyperther-
mophilic  archaea  were  known  as  reducing  sulfur  organisms 
[28].  Some  genus  of  Crenorchaeota,  such  as  Sulfolobus  dan 
Acidianus were known as sulfur oxidicing microbes [29, 30]. 
High  concentration  sulfate  ion  in  Kawah  Hujan  B  indicated 
that  there  were  sulphur  oxidicing  and  reducing  microbes 
[22].  However,  homological  analysis  of  16S  rRNA  gene 
fragment  of  Crenorchaoeta  from  Kawah  Hujan  B  showed 
that the sequences have many based substitution compared to 
that  the  GenBank  sequences.  In  addition,  the  phylogenetic 
analysis  showed  that  the  organisms  clustering  in  different 
branches.  This  suggested  that  the  Crenorchaoeta  from 

Kawah  Hujan  B  might  be  distinct  with  other  known 
organisms.  

  The  microbes,  obtained  from  enzymatic  based-cell  lyses 
were  slightly  different  with  physical  lyses.  Aeromonas  and 
Pantoea/Enterobacter  were  only  detected  by  physical  based 
method  while  microbe  belongs  to  Pseudomonas  only  found 
on  sample  lyses  by  enzymatic  method,  while,  the  archaea 
were  detected  by  both  methods.  This  again  suggested  that 
Kawah  Hujan  B  is  suitable  for  archaea  niches.  The  fail  to 
detect Aeromonas and Pantoea by enzymatic based lyses but 
successfully  by  physical  treatment  suggested  that  organism

might form biofilms or spores in Kawah Hujan B. Formation 
of  biofilm  were  one  of  microbial  adaptation  for  dynamic 
condition  of  environment  [26].  Furthermore,  some  microbes 

required  to  form  biofilm  for  growth  on  the  surface, 
especially for mud-associated growth mcrobes [31].

found  by  culture-

this  study  some  microbes 

 
independent  were  not  detected  in  cultivation  samples.  This  
is  probably  due  to  some  predominant  microbes  in  natural 
samples  belong  as  unculturable  organisms,  while  microbes 
were less dominat in nature  could grow better  in compatible 
media.  The  presence  of  Firmicute,  such  as  Alicyclobacillus 
in Kawah Hujan B  is not surprising since this microbe often 

found  in  geothermal  region  [32-35].  Alicyclobacillus  was 
thermoacidophilic  microbe,  Gram-positive  and  endospore 
forming [32, 36, 37]. Alicyclobacillus was aerobic and some 
showed  several  phenotypic  properties  such  as  the  ability  to 
oxidize  iron,  elemental  sulfur  and  sulfides  [34,  36].  These 
conditions were provided by Kawah Hujan B.

CONCLUSIONS 

  Biodiversity  of  microbial  diversity  from  an  acidic  hot 
spring  at  Kamojang  Geothermal  Field  was  performed  based 
on culture-dependent and culture-independent strategies. The 
majority  of  microbes  revealed  from  the  culture-independent 

were  close  to  Chrenorchaeota  and  Proteobacteria,  however, 
detail  analysis  of  the  sequences  closed  to  Chernorchaeota 
showed difference with other known sequence from the gen-
bank.  Meanwhile  microbes  identified  by  culture-dependent 
samples were closed to Firmicute and gamma Proteobacteria.
