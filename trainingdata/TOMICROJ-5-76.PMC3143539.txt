Abstract:  The  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  (HUS)  caused  by  Shiga  toxin-producing  Escherichia  coli  (STEC)  is  one  of  
the most frequent causes of pediatric acute renal failure. The aim of this study was to report the clinic and microbiologic 
features associated with 13 post-diarrheal HUS cases  identified in  pediatric intensive  care units  in the  city of São Paulo, 
Brazil,  from  January  2001  to  August  2005.  Epidemiologic,  clinic,  and  laboratorial  information,  along  with  fecal  and  
serum  samples,  were  collected  for  identifying  the  genetic  sequences  of  Stx  and  for  studying  antibodies  directed  against 
LPS O26, O111 and O157. STEC was isolated from three patients, and serotypes O26:H11, O157:H7 and O165:H- were 
identified.  In  nine  patients,  high  levels  of  IgM  against  LPS  O111  (n=2)  and  O157  (n=7)  were  detected.  Dialysis  was  
required in 76.9% of the patients;  arterial hypertension was present in 61.5%, neurological complications were observed 
in 30.7%, and only one patient died. During a 5–year follow-up period, one patient developed chronic kidney disease. The 
combined use of microbiologic and serologic techniques provided evidence of STEC infection in 92.3% of the HUS cases 
studied, and the importance of O157 STEC as agents of HUS in São Paulo has not been previously highlighted.

INTRODUCTION 

  Hemolytic  Uremic  Syndrome  (HUS),  a  life-threatening 
human  illness,  has  been  associated  with  Shiga  toxin-
producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections, particularly in 
children [1]. Although serotype  O157:H7 was  the first to be 
associated  with  enterohemorrhagic  disease  and  represent 
most  of  the  STEC  strains  related  to  large  outbreaks  and  se-
vere disease, a number of other non-O157 serotypes has been 
equally  associated  with  the  occurrence  of  HUS  [2].  Produc-
tion of Shiga  toxins (Stx1 and Stx2) is a key step in  the viru-
lence  mechanism  of  STEC,  believed  to  be  the  most  impor-
tant  event  towards  HUS  development  [3].  However,  pres-
ence  of  other  virulence  factors  like  a  hemolysin  called  en-
terohemorrhagic  E.  coli  (EHEC)  hemolysin  (Ehx)  and  the 
intimin  protein,  present  in  strains  that  harbor  the  eae  gene, 
can also contribute to STEC pathogenesis [4]. Infections due 
to  STEC  have  a  proven  zoonotic  character,  being  ruminant 
animals,  especially  cattle,  the  most  important  natural  reser-
voir  [5].  Therefore,  transmission  of  STEC  to  humans  oc-
curred mainly via the food chain or by direct contact with the 
animals or their environment, but person-to-person transmis-
sion, although less common, has also been reported [6,7]. 

 
In  Brazil,  efforts  have  been  made  to  establish  a  national 
surveillance  system  for  HUS  but  there  are  still  little  or  no

data available. However, in other Latin America countries as 
Argentina,  HUS  is  the  main  cause  of  acute  kidney  disease 
and  the  second  most  predominant  cause  of  chronic  kidney 
disease in children under the age of five years, and responsi-
ble for more  than 15% of kidney  transplants  in children and 
adolescents [8]. 

 
In 2001, we started a surveillance study on post-diarrheal 
HUS in São Paulo city,  Brazil,  to investigate the association 
of this syndrome with STEC infections. This study describes 
the  results  of  the  microbiologic  and  serologic  investigation 
of  cases  admitted  in  pediatric  intensive  care  units  (PICU), 
and their evolution, prognosis and mortality. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

  This  was  a  prospective  clinical,  observational,  multicen-
ter,  non-controlled  and  non-randomized  study,  performed 
from  2001  to  2005.  The  required  information  was  disclosed 
by the Department of Intensive  Care  and the Pediatric Soci-
ety in São Paulo, and pediatric intensive care physicians and 
nephrologists were asked to communicate the cases admitted 
to their units. The study was  approved by the  Research  Eth-
ics  Committee  at  the  Universidade  Federal  de  São  Paulo 
(UNIFESP),  and  parents  gave  informed  consent  for  their 
children  to  be  included  in  the  study.  The  criteria  for  enroll-
ment  included  children  hospitalized  in  the  PICU  with  an 
acute  case  of  hemolytic  microangiopathic  anemia,  kidney 
failure  and  thrombocytopenia,  which  was  preceded  by  
diarrhea  with  or  without  blood.  HUS  was  defined  as  acute

anemia  with  hemoglobin  <  10.5  g/dl,  with  or  without  
evidence  of  erythrocyte  fragmentation;  thrombocytopenia 
with < 75,000 /mm3; and acute kidney failure with creatinine  
levels over the upper limit for the age.  

population.  All  sera  were  diluted  1:500  in  PBS-Tween,  and  
the  cutoff  value  was  defined  as  the  average  of  the  IgM  
or  IgG  values  in  the  sera  plus  three  times  the  value  of  the  
standard deviation. 

 
Personal  and  demographic  data,  as  well  as  information 
regarding onset  and type of diarrhea, previous use of  antibi-
otics,  cases  of  diarrhea  in  the  family  or  closely  related  peo-
ple, eating habits,  ingestion of undercooked meat or of non-
pasteurized  foods  and  contact  with  animals  were  collected. 
Clinical and laboratory monitoring was performed during the 
hospitalization  from  2001  to  2005.  Information  about  the 
long-term effects of the disease was obtained through contact 
with  the  parents  and/or  nephrologists  who  accompanied  the 
patients. Data were collected until 2007. 

Isolation and Identification of STEC 

 
Fecal  samples  were  collected  as  soon  as  HUS  was  
suspected  and  plated  onto  Sorbitol-MacConkey  agar  and 
incubated  at  37oC  for  18  hours.  Sorbitol  fermenting  and  
non-fermenting  E.  coli  isolates  were  tested  for  stx1  and  stx2 
by  polymerase  chain  reactions  (PCR)  [9].  The  stx  positive 
isolates were serotyped by standard procedures using O (O1 
–  O181)  and  H  (H1-H56)  antisera  kindly  provided  by  the 
Centers  for  Diseases  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC,  USA) 
[10].  STEC  isolates  were  further  tested  for  the  presence  of 
intimin (eae) and enterohemolysin (ehxA) gene sequences by 
PCR  as  previously  described  [11,12].  To  verify  the  expres-
sion  of  Stx  toxins,  filtrates  from  E.  coli  positive  culture  
samples used in the PCR trials were prepared and inoculated 
into HeLa and Vero cell monolayers, [13].  

Detection of LPS Antibodies 

Presence of IgM and IgG classes of antibody against LPS  
 
O26,  O111  and  O157  was  searched  for  by  enzyme-linked  
immunosorbent  (ELISA)  assays  in  serum  samples  collected  
from all patients except one, at admission or as soon as HUS  
was  diagnosed  (acute  phase)  using  the  methods  described  
[14,15]. In brief, PolySorp ELISA plates (NUNC, Naperville,  
III.,  USA)  were  coated  with  10  μg/ml  of  E.  coli  LPS  O26  
and O111, purchased from Sigma (Sigma Chemical Co. - St.  
Louis, MO, USA), and LPS O157 (List Biological Laboratories,  
Inc  -  California,  USA).  Sera  samples  were  diluted  1:500  in  
Phosphate-buffered  saline  (PBS)  containing  0.05%  Tween  
20  and  incubated  for  2  hours  at  room  temperature.  Presence  
of  IgM  and  IgG  antibodies  was  investigated  in  the  samples  
by  using  anti-human  IgM  and  IgG  conjugated  peroxidase  
(Sigma)  diluted  1:1000  and  incubated  for  2  hours  at  
room temperature. Reaction was developed with 10 mg of o- 
phenylenediamine  in  citrate buffer pH  4.5  containing 0.012%  
H2O2,  and  absorbance  values  were  measured  at  492  nm  
(A492).  Positive  sera  controls  were  included  in  all  ELISA  
assays  and  were  obtained  from  patients  who  had  HUS  in  
association  with  STEC  O26  and  O157  infections  (kind  gift  
from  Dr.  Alfredo  Caprioli,  Istituto  Superiore  di  Sanità,  
Rome, Italy). The O111 positive control serum was obtained  
at the beginning of this study. 

  One  sera  sample  obtained  from  63  children  without  
gastrointestinal  symptoms  and  infection  who  had  visited  the  
outpatient  clinic  of  the  São  Paulo  Hospital  from  August  to  
September  of  2004  were  used  to  evaluate  the  presence  of  
antibodies  against  LPS  O26,  O111  and  O157  in  the  general  

  To  confirm  the  specifity  of  the  ELISA  results,  LPS  im-
munoblotting  was  performed  as  described  by  Chart  et  al. 
[16]  using  patients  sera  diluted  1:100,  and  bound  immuno-
globulin was detected using anti-human polyvalent immuno-
globulins  conjugated  peroxidase  (Sigma  Chemical  Co.)  di-
luted 1:2000 and the reaction was developed using chemilu-
minescent  detection  system  (ECL,  Amersham  Biosciences, 
Sweden).  

RESULTS 

1. Epidemiology 

  Thirteen  cases  fulfilled  the  diagnostic  criteria  and  there 
was no refusal to participate in the study. Ten patients (77%) 
came  from  private  hospitals  and  three  (23%)  from  public 
hospitals.  Ages  ranged  from  8  months  to  6  years  and  3 
months,  with  a  mean  of  2  years  and  5  months.  However, 
almost half of the patients (46%) were less  than 2 years old. 
Eight  patients  (61.5%)  were  female.  The  seasonal  distribu-
tion  of  the  cases  was  as  follows:  six  cases  in  the  Summer, 
three  in  the  Winter,  three  in  the  Spring  and  one  in  the  Fall. 
All  children  had  diarrhea,  69.2%  with  blood  or  mucus,  and 
with  diarrheal  prodroms  for  a  median  of  6.4 days  (Table 1). 
There  were  no  reports  of  diarrhea  or  gastroenteritis  among 
family members or people in close contact with the patients. 
A positive response  to  the  ingestion of undercooked or non-
pasteurized  food,  or  contact  with  animals  (specifically  bo-
vines) occurred in 69.2% of patients (Table 1). 

2. Isolation and Identification of STEC 

 
STEC  was  isolated  from  three  out  of  seven  patients 
whose stool cultures yielded bacterial growth,  and serotypes 
O26:H11,  O157:H7  and  O165:HNM  were  identified  (Table 
1).  Except  for  the  O26:H11  strain  that  harbored  stx1  eae 
ehxA,  the  other  STEC  isolates  presented  the  stx2  stx2c  eae 
ehxA genotype. Expression of Stx was identified in all STEC 
isolates. 

3. LPS Antibodies 

  Low  levels  of  antibodies  to  LPS  O26,  O111  and  O157 
were  identified  in  sera  of  children  with  no  gastrointestinal 
disorders (control population), with cutoff values (Cv) (cid:1) 0.5, 
except  for  O111  IgG  responses  that  presented  variations, 
generating  a  Cv  =1.095  (Table  2,  Fig.  1-3).  In  contrast, 
higher  levels  of  O111  LPS  antibodies  (IgM  and  IgG)  were 
identified  in sera of 2 out of 12 HUS patients (Table 1, Fig. 
2),  and  increased  levels  of  IgM  to  LPS  O157  were  detected 
in  sera  from  7  patients  (Table  1,  Fig.  3).  In  five  of  these 
seven patients, high levels of IgG were also identified. These 
levels of antibodies were much higher than the cuttoff values 
observed in the group of children with no diarrhea (Table 2, 
Figs.  2,3),  even  when  higher  serum  dilutions  (1:1000)  were 
analyzed (data not shown). ELISA results were confirmed by 
specific  O157  and  O111  LPS  recognition  in  HUS  patient’s 
sera  by  immunoblotting  analysis  (Fig.  4).  Serum  samples 
taken  approximately  15  days  after  hospital  admission  (con-
valescence) were available for ELISA analysis from 7 of the

in five patients the IgM and IgG levels were still higher than 
the cuttoff values (data not shown).  

4. Clinical and Laboratory Data 

  The  clinical  and  laboratory  characteristics  of  HUS  cases 
are shown in Table 3. The average hemoglobin value was 8.2 
g/dl,  and  the  lowest  limit  for  platelets  was  15,000/mm3. 
Changes  in  kidney  function  showed  average  creatinine  val-
ues  of  3.27  mg/dl,  and  average  urea  values  of  132  mg/dl. 
Four  patients  (30%)  showed  the  presence  of  schistocytes. 
Normalization  of  the  platelet  count  occurred  in  76%  of  the 
patients  two  weeks  after  the  onset  of  the  disease.  Only  38% 
of the patients exhibited normalization of creatinine levels in 
the  first  two  weeks  of  the  disease,  and  two  patients  (15%) 
exhibited oliguria for a period of more than 15 days. Arterial 

hypertension  was  observed  in  eight  patients  (61.5%),  and 
involvement  of  the  central  nervous  system  was  seen  in  four 
(30.7%);  changes  in  other  organs  or  systems  were  not  ob-
served. Renal replacement therapy with peritoneal dialysis in 
the first 24 hours of admission to the PICU was necessary in 
10  (76.9%)  patients,  with  an  average  time  of  dialysis  of  12 
days (range: 6–38 days). The average length of stay in PICU 
was 16 days, and the average duration of hospitalization was 
24 days.  The only patient  who died exhibited severe arterial 
hypertension  that  was  difficult  to  control,  bleeding  and  neu-
rological involvement; anti-LPS O111, IgM (0.775) and IgG 
(3.200)  antibodies  were  also  detected.  During  the  2  to  5 
years  following  hospitalization,  a  questionnaire  was  sent  to 
the  parents  or  nephrologists  who  had  accompanied  the  chil-
dren.  From  this,  we  found  that  only  one  patient  (1/10)  had 
developed  chronic  kidney  disease  without  hypertension  or 
the need for dialysis after discharge, but had persistent prote-
inuria. Two patients presented neurological  sequelae, one of 
them with paresis of the lower left limb from a hemorrhagic

  The first report of a case of HUS in Brazil was made by 
Penna et  al.  in  1967  [17].  In  1983,  Carvalhaes  and  Nobrega 
described two cases of post-diarrheal HUS in five-month-old 
twins [18].

The Open Microbiology Journal, 2011, Volume 5    81 

  The  incidence  of  HUS  in  São  Paulo  is  not  well  docu-
mented  and  diagnosis  may  also  be  underestimated.  Data 
from the  center for epidemiological  surveillance in  the  State 
of  São  Paulo  (www.cve.saude.sp.gov.br/htm/hidrica/hidri_ 
estat.html)  show  an  incidence  of  HUS  from  1998  to  2007 
that  ranges  from  0.01  to  0.05  per  100,000  children,  but  all 
forms of HUS  are  included.  During the period of this study, 
we identified 13 HUS cases associated with diarrhea, and all 
the  cases  exhibited  the  characteristics  of  the  illness  and 
therefore fit the classic definition of HUS.  

In  Argentina,  HUS  incidence  increased  from  8.2,  in 
 
1998,  to  13.9/100,000  children  under  five  years  of  age  in 
2005. This was due, in part, to the mandatory notification by 
the national epidemiological surveillance system, established 
in  2000  by  the  ministry  of  health  [8].  In  Germany  and  Aus-
tria,  the  incidence  is  0.7  and  0.4,  respectively,  in  children 
younger than 15 years of age [19]. In France, the incidence is 
0.7 in children younger than 15 and 1.8 per 100,000 children 
younger than 5 years [20]. In England,  the  incidence is 1.54 
in children younger than five, while it is 3.4 in Scotland and 
2.33  in  Ireland  [21].  In  Italy,  the  incidence  is  0.2  [22],  and 
the reported incidence ranges from 0.2 to 3.4 in the USA [6].  

  Albeit  the  paucity  of  data  on  HUS  associated  STEC  in-
fections  in  our  settings,  several  STEC  serotypes,  including 
those principals responsible for HUS in other countries, have 
been isolated from sporadic cases of diarrhea, particularly in 
children,  in  different  regions  of  Brazil  [23-31].  Maybe  the 
most  important  factor  is  the  lack  of  warning  before  onset  of 
the  illness,  but  physicians  should  be  watchful  for  cases  of 
severe  diarrhea,  especially  in  young  infants,  since  15%  of 
STEC  infections  can  develop  into  HUS  [32],  and  90%  of 
HUS cases are caused by STEC [7, 33].  

  Our  study  was  the  first  to  successfully  demonstrate  the 
isolation and identification of O157:H7 as well as non-O157 
STEC strains  in patients with HUS  in  Brazil. The first  HUS 
case  associated  with  STEC  O26:H11  was  reported  in  2002, 
and  the  other  related  to  STEC  O165:H-  was  published  in 
2007 [34, 35].  

  The  detection  of  serum  antibodies  to  the  LPS  of  E.  coli 
O157  and  other  non-O157  isolates  has  been  reported  as  an 
effective  method  to  diagnose  infections  by  these  organisms 
in  HUS  patients  [14,  16,  33,  36].  In  the  present  study,  high 
levels  of  antibodies  to  O157  LPS  were  detected  in  sera  of 
seven  patients.  These  results  strongly  support  evidence  of 
infection  by  O157  isolates  in  these  HUS  patients,  as  preva-
lence  of  LPS  antibodies  in  the  control  population  was  very 
low. On the other hand, a more caution analysis on the asso-
ciation  of  O111  LPS  response  and  HUS  needs  to  be  made. 
This  serogroup  can  be  related  to  different  diarrheagenic  E. 
coli pathotypes, and has been frequently implicated as agents 
of  children  diarrhea  in  São  Paulo,  Brazil  [26,  37].  The  high 
titers  of  IgG  to  O111  LPS  presently  identified  among  the 
control  population,  and  in  some  HUS  patients,  certainly  re-
flect  the  important  circulation  of  this  serogroup  in  our  set-
tings.  However,  the  higher  titers  of  IgM  antibodies  to  LPS 
O111 identified in two HUS patients, compared to the cutoff 
values obtained among the controls, can suggest an evidence 
of  association  of  this  serogroup  with  the  present  disease.  In 
addition,  the  specificity  of  the  ELISA  results  was  also  con-
firmed  by  immunoblotting  analysis,  that  showed  specific 
O157  and  O111  LPS  recognition  in  HUS  patients  sera.  The 

above  results  confirm  that  investigation  of  the  specific  im-
mune  response  can  improve  the  diagnosis  of  STEC  infec-
tions  especially  in  HUS  patients  whose  stool  cultures  are 
negative [14, 16, 33]. 

  Although in the present study the source of infection was 
not traced back, the reported consumption of non-pasteurized 
milk or undercooked meat seemed to be the primary cause of 
infection  in the majority of  the  cases  studied,  as reported by 
others [6, 8, 38, 39]. 

  The data presented on  the evolution of the  illness, dialy-
sis, prognosis, and mortality are similar to those described in 
the  literature  [8,  19,  20].  Dialysis  started  during  admission 
when  the  patient  presented  with  oliguria  or  anuria.  The  per-
centage of patients on dialysis in Germany, Austria and Aus-
tralia  (63%)  was  closer  to  our  study  and  greater  than  that 
from Argentina (59.8%),  France (53%) and  the USA (55%). 
Our  population  consisted  of  patients  admitted  in  the  PICU, 
thus  the  severity  of  the  conditions  may  justify  the  greater 
requirement  of  dialysis  (77%)  and  the  development  of  arte-
rial  hypertension  (61.5%).  However,  in  the  study  by  Gerber 
et  al.  [19],  only  15%  exhibited  elevation  of  blood  pressure 
levels.  

 
In  spite  of  the  low  mortality,  renal  sequelae  and  chronic 
kidney disease can reach 50% in the long term if all forms of 
HUS  are  considered.  Miliwebsky  et  al.  [40]  analyzed  cases 
of  HUS  associated  with  STEC  infections,  and  reported  re-
covery of renal function in 96.2% of the patients and chronic 
kidney  disease  in  only  2.4%,  while  Cavagnaro  et  al.  [41] 
reported that 11.6% of the patients developed chronic kidney 
disease.  Complete recovery of renal function within the first 
months after the illness was exhibited by the majority of our 
patients.  Certainly,  the  prognosis  of  typical  HUS  is  better, 
and  recurrence  is  rare  when  compared  with  other  forms  of 
the syndrome [32]. The monitoring time for our patients was 
relatively  short,  and it seems prudent  to evaluate renal func-
tion  and  proteinuria/hematuria  for  several  years  after  HUS. 
Neurological  changes  were  found  in  four  patients.  One  of 
them  died,  and  the  other  two  exhibited  sequelae,  one  with 
delayed  changes  in  walking.  In  studies  on  the  prognosis  of 
HUS,  data  are  not  presented  in  relation  to  neurological  se-
quelae  or  concern  over  neuro-motor  complications.  It  seems 
important that pediatricians remain vigilant over the changes 
in neurological development in patients affected by HUS. 

 
In  conclusion,  the  combined  use  of  microbiologic  and 
serologic techniques provided evidence of STEC infection in 
92.3%  of  the  HUS  cases  studied,  and  the  importance  of 
O157  STEC  as  agents  of  HUS  in  São  Paulo  has  not  been 
previously  highlighted.  Albeit  the  limited  number  of  HUS 
cases  identified  during  the  studied  period,  that  may  fortu-
nately  suggest  a  relatively  low  incidence  of  this  syndrome, 
our data strongly indicate that in order to accurately diagnose 
HUS and identify the etiological agent, implements of a sur-
veillance  system  based  on  information  from  nephrologists, 
intensive care specialists and general pediatricians as well as 
on proper laboratory diagnostic procedures are needed.
