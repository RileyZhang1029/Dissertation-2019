Aspergillus  fumigatus  is  associated  with  invasive  disease  aspergillosis  in  immunocompromised  individuals.  The  major  aim  of
this  study  was  to  investigate  the  biochemical  and  immunological  responses  of  male  Wistar  rats  against  A.  fumigatus  exper-
imentally-induced  pulmonary  fungal  infection.  Nostril  experimental  exposure  of  male  Wistar  rats  to  a  high  dose  of  A.  fumi-
gatus  freeze-dried  preparation  for  only  24 hr  resulted  in  a  significant  increase  in  levels  of  catalase,  nitric  oxide  and  lipid
peroxide  in  lung  homogenates,  compared  to  those  of  the  control  animals.  However,  the  oxidative  status  of  the  lungs  of  rats
challenged  with  killed  fungus  did  not  change  significantly,  except  for  the  stimulation  in  the  level  of  lipid  peroxide.  IgG  level
was  significantly  elevated  only  in  rats  that  received  two  low  doses  of  fungus,  compared  to  unexposed  animals  (p < 0.005).
Examining  the  lung  of  rats  exposed  to  A.  fumigatus  revealed  no  abnormal  changes,  except  for  pus  in  bronchial  lumen  spaces
and  per  bronchial  inflammation.  Histologically,  large  numbers  of  granuloma  cells  were  evident  in  the  lungs  of  challenged
rats,  while  no  granuloma  formation  was  evident  in  the  lungs  of  rats  exposed  to  killed  fungus.

Aspergillus infections are among the most feared opportu-
nistic  infections  in  humans.  Aspergillus  fungi  are  ubiqui-
tous  in  nature;  thus,  exposure  to  their  spores  must  be  a
common  event.  Aspergillus  is  saprophytic  in  soil  and  on
many  kinds  of  decaying  organic  matter.  A.  fumigatus  is
the  most  common  species  isolated  from  human  infec-
tions,  and  it  is  often  associated  with  invasive  aspergillosis
in  immunosuppressed  patients  [1].  Aspergillosis  is  an
invasive  disease  of  the  lungs,  although  colonization  of
other  organs  can  occur.  The  infection  is  serious  and  can
often  prove  fatal  due  to  the  difficulty  of  diagnosis  and
poor prognosis [1-5].

In healthy individuals, anatomical barriers and the com-
ponents  of  the  immune  system  including  serum  comple-
ment,  antibodies,  phagocytes  and  cell-mediated  immunity
generally  provide  protection  against  infection  [6].  However,
the  host  immune  defense  mechanisms  against  aspergillo-
sis are unclear.

Reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  are  essential  compo-
nents  of  the  defensive  mechanism  against  fungus  infection
[7-9].  Nitric  oxide  (NO)  production  in  mammals  is  regu-
lated  by  various  stimuli  and  plays  several  roles,  ranging
from  homeostatic  control  of  arteriolar  pressure  to  immu-
nomodulant  effects  [10, 11].  NO  is  also  an  important  anti-
microbial agent [12]. Although susceptibility is not universal,
NO-related  antimicrobial  activity  has  been  shown  against
a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms including par-

asites, viruses, bacteria and fungi [13].

We  have  studied  the  expression  of  inducible  nitric
oxide  synthetase  (iNOS)  and  arginine  metabolism  in  lung
of  mouse  exposed  to  Fusarium  kyushuense  [14].  The
present study was undertaken to understand more fully the
mechanism  of  protection  from  A.  fumigatus  pulmonary
infection in a rat model.

Materials  and  Methods

Animals. Forty  male  Wistar  rats,  8-weeks-of-age,  weigh-
ing  180~200 g  were  maintained  in  a  controlled  environ-
ment of  temperature,  humidity  and  light. They  were fed  a
commercial rat chow and tap water.

Fungal  strain. A.  fumigatus  was  isolated  and  identified
from  a  patient  with  bronchial  asthma.  The  isolate  was
maintained on 2% corn meal agar for 21 days at 28 ± 2oC.
After  the  incubation  period,  the  fungus  was  filtered  though
cheese  cloth  (muslin)  and  washed  several  times  with
deionized  water  and  freeze-dried.  Prior  to  infection,  0.2 g
of fungus was suspended in 1 mL of sterile cold 0.9% saline
and homogenized manually in a glass homogenizer [15].

Experimental  infection. Rats  were  divided  into  four
groups  (n = 10  per  group).  The  first  group  (group  I)  of
animals received 40 µL of 0.9% saline by drop-wise addi-
tion  into  a nostril under  mild anesthesia and served as  the
control. Group II similarly received 900 µg of A. fumigatus

extract suspended in 40 µL of 0.9% saline. Group III sim-
ilarly  received  a  single  dose  of  autoclaved  A.  fumigatus
(900 µg/rat).  Group  IV  similarly  received  A.  fumigatus
(200 µg/rat)  day  0  of  the  experiment  and  followed  by
another application of the same amount of fungus at day 6
(Fig.  1).  After  24 hr  of  treatment,  rats  were  killed  and
lung, spleen and blood specimens were collected.

Determination  of  NO  in  lung  homogenate. One  half
of  each  lung  was  homogenized  in  ice-cold  physiological
saline  using  an  electrical  homogenizer.  The  extract  was
filtered  through  a  filter  membrane  and  the  clear  filtrate
was  used  in  the  determination  the  of  level  of  NO  [16].
Briefly, equal volume of lung homogenate and Griess reagent
(1%  sulfanilamide/0.1%  nephthylethelene  diamine/2.5%
phosphoric  acid)  was  mixed  and  incubated  at  room  tem-
perature  for  10 min.  NO  concentration  was  determined
spectrophotometrically at 520 nm using sodium nitrite as a
standard.

Catalase  activity  assay. Catalase  activity  was  determined
in  the  lung  homogenate  as  previously  described  [17].  The
activity of one unit of catalase was defined as the amount
of  enzyme  that  decomposes  1 µmol  of  hydrogen  peroxide
(H2O2) per minute, and the specific activity was expressed
as mmol/min/mg protein

Lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxide level as thiobarbitu-
ric  acid  reactive  species  was  assayed  in  lung  homoge-
nates  by  the  measuring  malondialdehyde  (MDA)  content
using 1, 1', 3, 3'-tetraethoxy-propane as the standard [18].

Determination  of  total  protein. Total  soluble  protein
concentration  in  the  homogenate  of  lung  was  determined
as previously described [19].

Determination of IgG concentration in rat serum. The
level  of  IgG  in  the  rat  serum  was  determined  by  using  a
previously described radial immunodiffusion method [20].

Histology. The lung was removed and half was immedi-
ately  fixed  in  10%  (v/v)  neutral  buffered  formalin.  After
dehydration  in  a  graded  ethanol  series  and  clearing  with
xylene,  the  material  was  embedded  in  paraffin  and  8 µm-
thick  sections  were  stained  with  hematoxylin  and  eosin
for light microscope observation.

Statistical  analysis. The  statistical  analysis  was  carried
out  using  SPSS  (SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  IL,  USA)  [21].  All
data  are  expressed  as  mean ± SE.  The  statistical  differ-
ences  were  analyzed  using  Student’s  t-test.  Differences
were considered significant at p < 0.05.

Results

Experimental  infection  of  rats  with  different  doses  of
freeze-dried  A.  fumigatus  preparations  was  successfully
established  (data  not  shown).  Then,  a  high  dose  of  A.
fumigatus (900 µg/rat) was used to examine the biochemi-
cal  and  immunological  responses  of  the  host  against  the
fungal  exposure.  Rats  were  first  exposed  to  a  single  high
dose  of  fungal  preparation  (group  II)  and  with  the  same
dose  of  killed  fungus  (group  III),  while  the  group  IV  of

rats were treated with two minimal doses of fungal prepa-
ration (200 µg/rat, on days 0 and 6) (Fig. 1).

Determination of the oxidative status of male Wistar rats
after  inhalation  of  A.  fumigatus  demonstrated  that  expo-
sure  of  male  Wistar  rats  to  900 µg  of  A.  fumigatus  for
only 24 hr resulted in a significant increase in the level of
catalse,  NO  and  lipid  peroxides  in  lung  homogenates,
compared  to  control  rats  (Figs.  1~3).  The  same  dose  of
killed  fungus  showed  a  stimulatory  effect  on  the  level  of
lipid  peroxide  compared  to  the  control  group,  while  no
significant  changes  were  observed  in  the  level  of  catalase
and  NO.  Moreover,  the  oxidative  status  of  male  Wistar
rats exhibited non-significant changes when treated with a
low  booster  dose  on day  6  compared  to  the  control  group
(Table 1).

Group  IV  rats  that  received  two  low  doses  of  fungus
within a week exhibited a significant elevation in IgG level
compared  with  controls  (p < 0.005).  No  statistical  differ-
ence was seen between groups I, II and controls (Fig. 2).

Examining  the  lung  of  rats  administered  A.  fumigatus
intranasally after 24 hr revealed no abnormal changes, except
for  the  existence  of  pus  cells  in  bronchial  lumen  spaces,
and  peribronchial  inflammation  including  lymphocytes,  neu-
trophiles  and  macrophages  (Fig.  3B).  However,  rat  lungs

challenged  after  6  days  of  the  first  exposure  contained
large  numbers  of  granuloma  (Fig.  3D),  which  contained
numerous  cell  fragments  that  had  been  phagocytized  by
macrophages.  Inflammatory  cells  consisted  of  histiocytes,
lymphocytes and a few polymorphonuclear leuckocytes in
addition  to  Langhan’s  giant  cells.  However,  examination
of lung tissues of rats exposed to the autoclaved A. fumig-
atus  preparation  for  24 hr  revealed  normal  cells  without
granuloma formation, although infiltration for immune cells
included macrophages, neutrophiles and lymphocytes.

Discussion

The present study sheds light on the  influence of A. fumi-
gatus  in  the  oxidative  status  and  immune  response  of
male  Wistar  rats  in  addition  to  histological  manifestation
of  the  infection.  A.  flavus  has  been  reported  as  a  potent
hepatotoxic  and  hepatocarcinogenic  agent  in  humans  and
various  animal  species  [22].  The  present  results  demon-
strate  that  the  inhalation  of  a  high  dose  (900 µg)  of  A.
fumigatus  for  24 hr  leads  to  the  elevation  of  oxidative
stress  of  male  Wistar  rats.  The  activity  of  NO  and  lipid
peroxide  measured  as  MDA,  as  well  as  catalase,  have
been  significantly  increased.  These  findings  indicate  that
ROS has a defensive role against A. fumigatus infection at
an  early  stage  of  infection.  ROS  are  involved  in  many  of
the  complex  interactions  between  the  invading  microor-
ganisms and its host [23]. Production of ROS by the host,
especially  by  phagocytes,  is  a  counteractive  mechanism
aimed  at  microbial  elimination.  Phagocytosis  and  mecha-
nisms  of  killing  of  A.  fumigatus  conidia  by  murine  alveo-
lar macrophages have been studied [24]. In that study, the

engulfment  of  conidia  by  murine  alveolar  macrophages
took  place  within  2 hr  after  infection  and  the  killing  pro-
cess  began  after  6 hr  of  phagocytosis  and  is  mediated  by
ROS.

The  antimicrobial  activity  of  NO  has  been  demon-
strated  by  a  variety  of  approaches  [10, 11].  Yet,  an  excess
of  NO  production  may  become  dangerous  for  the  cells.
The  same  observation  has  been  reported  in  an  in  vitro
study  [25],  in  which  decreased  cell  viability  was  associ-
ated  with  an  increase  in  iNOS  activity  after  the  treatment
of human erythroid K-562 cells with A. terreus.

On the other hand, the present results showed no signif-
icant  change  in  the  activities  of  NO  and  catalase  in  male
Wistar  rats  exposed  to  either  killed  fungus  or  to  low
booster dose of A. fumigatus, compared to that of the con-
trol  group.  This  observation  may  confirm  the  antimicro-
bial  role  of  NO  at  early  stage  of  infection  with  living
organisms.  This  might  be  attributed  to  the  ability  of  liv-
ing fungus to produce mycotoxins [26].

On  the  other  hand,  the  level  of  IgG  in  the  serum  of
male Wistar rats exposed to a single dose of either live or
killed  A.  fumigatus  showed  an  insignificant  change  when
compared to that of the control group, while the IgG level
was dramatically increased in rats after treatment with the
second  dose  of  A.  fumigatus.  Thus,  it  can  be  concluded
that the resistance against fungal infection is carried out at
earlier stage of infection with help of immune cells, while
the  contribution  of  humoral  immunity  comes  later.  It  has
been reported that the invasive aspergillosis cause a paral-
ysis of immune system in humans [1].

Constitutive NOS and iNOS inhibit the development of
several pathogens.  This  study indicated  a high activity for
NOS in rat lung exposed to the lung preparation for 24 hr
without  challenge  comparing  to  the  killed  fungal  prepara-
tion  and  the  challenged  rats.  This  might  due  to  the  early
killing  of  fungi  by  alveolar  macrophages  [27].  Although
monocytes,  macrophages  and  neutrophiles  can  damage
fungal  hyphae,  but  the  interactions  of  several  potential  oxi-
dative  and  nonoxidative  antihyphae  mechanisms  may  define
the  host  ability  to  limit  fungal  infections.  NOS  catalyzes
the  production  of  nitric  oxide;  a  mediator  of  potential
importance  in  numerous  physiologic  and  inflammatory
processes in the lung.

Presently,  catalase  activity  was  highest  in  rats  exposed
to  a  live  fungal  extract  (GII),  followed  by  rats  challenged
with  killed  A.  fumigates  (GIII).  However,  this  differs  from
a  previous  study  [28]  that  concluded  that  the  antimicro-
bial  and  cytotoxic  actions  of  NO  are  enhanced  by  other
macrophage  products  such  as  H2O2,  cysteine,  glutathione,
acid or peroxide.

Intranasal  administration  of  A.  flavus  antigen  induced
hypersensitivity  that  was  characterized  by  elevated  anti-A.
flavus  IgG  antibody  level  in  serum.  This  type  of  hyper-
sensitivity  in  rat  constitutes  a  humoral  immune  reaction

[29] where the specific IgG level was increased during the
experiment,  after  the  first  exposure  without  challenge,  in
rats  challenged  with  the  living  fungi  and  in  rats  challenged
with killed fungi.

Granuloma  was  observed  only  in  lung  tissue  of  rats
exposed  to  A.  flavus  freeze-dried  preparation  and  challenged
after  6  days  of  first  exposure.  Granuloma  is  a  compact
organized  structure  dominated  by  mononuclear  phago-
cytes.  It  is  formed  as  a  result  of  an  unsuccessful  attempt
to  remove  irritants  [30].  The  presence  of  multinucleated
giant cells is a common feature within the granuloma. It is
assumed  that  these  cells  play  a  role  in  protecting  the  host
from  a  persistent  invader,  as  doe’s  grnuloma  itself  [31].  It
has  been  established  that  antigen-sensitized  T  lymphocytes
are  involved  in  the  formation  of  granuloma  [32].  In  vivo,
granuloma  formation  is  accompanied  by  monocyte  prolif-
eration  [33].  Rats  exposed  to  either  A.  flavus  freeze-dried
for only 24 hr or to killed fungi did not form in vivo gran-
uloma.  This  indicates  that  the  rats  cleared  the  infecting
fungal elements  like hyphae or spores  by different  immune
cells  and  different  host  immune  defending  enzymes.  One
complication of pulmonary aspergillosis might be the dep-
osition  of  calcium  oxalate  crystals  in  the  tissue  [34].  This
is  most  commonly  seen  with  A.  niger  infection  and  is
believed  to  be  caused  by  the  combination  of  oxalic  acid
produced  by  the  fungal  mycelia  with  the  patient’s  serum
calcium,  with  the  presence  of  crystals  indicative  of  the
chronic and severe nature of the disease.
