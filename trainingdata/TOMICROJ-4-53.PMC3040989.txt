Abstract:  We  investigated  the  bacterial  composition  in  the  gut  of  Formosan  subterranean  termites  (FST), Coptotermes 
formosanus Shiraki, collected from southern China (native range) vs. Louisiana, U. S. (introduced range) using 16S rRNA 
gene  sequencing. Overall, we identified 213 bacteria ribotypes from thirteen phyla. The  enemy  release hypothesis  could 
not  be  invoked  to  explain  invasion  success  of  FST  since  no  pathogens  were  found  among  the  bacterial  gut  community  
regardless  of  geographic  origin.  Invasion  of  new  habitats  did  not  significantly  change  the  bacteria  composition.  
Apparently,  the  tight  co-evolutionary link between  termites  and their gut flora maintains a certain association of species 
and  functional  groups.  Ribotype  richness,  bacteria  diversity,  and  proportions  of  detected  phyla  were  not  influenced  by 
geographic origin of FST samples; however, these parameters were affected by storage of the samples. Ethanol storage of 
termite samples (5 yrs) increased the relative proportions of gram-positive bacteria versus gram-negative bacteria.

INTRODUCTION 

 
Intestinal symbionts have  contributed to the  evolutionary 
success  of  various  insects  [1,  2].  Gut  symbionts  enable  a 
variety  of  insects  to  utilize  refractory  and  nutrient-deficient 
diets  by  supplying  digestive  and  detoxifying  enzymes  and 
serving  as sources of nitrogen, vitamins  and energy. Symbi-
onts  can  also  protect  their  host  from  invasion  by  foreign 
pathogens [1].  

  Because there are so many benefits conferred by symbio-
sis,  questions  have  been  raised  about  whether  symbionts 
could  facilitate  the  establishment  and  success  of  invasive 
insects  by  enabling  their  hosts  to  tolerate  rapid  changes  in 
habitat  and  diet.  For  example,  it  has  been  shown  that  the 
intestinal symbiont flora of insects adapts quickly to changes 
in  environmental  conditions  and  diet  by  the  induction  of  
enzymes or a shift in  the species composition [1, 3-7]. Also, 
symbionts can be digested by the host and used as a tempo-
rary  protein,  lipid,  carbohydrate  and  vitamin  source  during 
times of starvation [8]. While the partnership with beneficial 
symbionts  that  are  obligate  for  survival  has  to  remain  intact 
through  the  invasion  process,  transient  pathogens  might  get 
lost  and  thus  increase  the  survival  and  competitive  edge  of 
the  introduced  populations  (enemy-release-hypothesis  [9]). 
Therefore,  investigating  both,  the  composition  of  beneficial 
symbionts  and  pathogens  in  the  native  and  introduced  
range of an invasive species might reveal cues to its invasion 
success. 

 
Symbiont  communities  have  been  investigated  in  only  a 
few  invasive  insect  species,  including  the  Asian  longhorned

beetle,  Anoplophora  glabripennis  [10],  the  gypsy  moth,  
Lymantria  dispar  [11],  the  emerald  ash  borer,  Agrilus 
planipennis  [12]  and  the  invasive  subterranean  termite  
species  Coptotermes  formosanus  [13,  14].  Although  such 
invasive  species/symbiont  complexes  have  been  described 
for  certain  locations  or  populations,  without  direct  compari-
son  of  the  symbiont  communities 
in  the  native  and  
introduced  ranges,  it  remains  unknown  how  the  symbiont 
community  changes  and  adapts  as  the  hosts  invade  new  
regions  and  if  there  is  a  release  from  pathogenic  members  
in the symbiont community in the introduced range. 

Invasive subterranean termites of the genera Reticulitermes 
 
and Coptotermes (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) and their diverse 
symbiont  community  have  a  large  impact  on  ecology  and 
economy  in  tropical,  subtropical  and  temperate  regions 
around  the  world  due  to  their  ability  to  degrade  plant  mate-
rial and cycle nutrients. Plant material is rich in lignocellulo-
ses,  but  deficient  in  vitamins  and  essential  components  for 
protein  and  fat  synthesis.  Therefore,  subterranean  termites 
are  dependent  on  a  diverse  assemblage  of  eukaryotic  (Proti-
sta, Fungi) and prokaryotic (Archaea, Eubacteria) symbionts 
in their hindguts to digest lignocellulosic compounds [6] and 
supplement  their nutrition with nitrogen [15, 16], acetate for 
energy production [17] and vitamins [18, 19].  

  While  the  number  of  eukaryotic  symbiont  species  in  the 
subterranean  termite  gut  is  relatively  limited,  the  prokaryote 
diversity  is  astonishing  and  only  a  small  fraction  has  been 
cultured so far [20]. To obtain comparatively unbiased bacte-
rial inventories,  culture  independent molecular  methods cur-
rently are used to identify species, describe species richness, 
relative  abundance,  phylogenetic  affiliation  and  putative 
functions (reviewed in [21]). The most widely used approach 
to  describe  bacterial  communities  is  to  sequence  species-
specific  16S  rRNA  genes.  Certain  regions  in  rRNA  genes

accumulate  variation  as  the  organisms  diverge.  Flanking 
regions  remain  conserved  and  can  therefore  be  used  to  con-
struct  universal  primers  for  amplification  and  sequencing  of 
the  rRNA  gene  [22].  Bacteria  inventories  in  subterranean 
termite guts have been described using 16S rRNA sequences 
and culture-independent methods for Reticulitermes speratus 
from Japan [23-26], R. flavipes from North America [27], R. 
santonensis,  the  European  synonym  of  R.  flavipes [28],  and 
the  Formosan  subterranean  termite  (FST),  C.  formosanus 
from  Japan  [14].  The  latter  species  is  one  of  the  most  suc-
cessful  invasive  insect  pests  known  and  continues  to  spread 
in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, the Pacific region 
and  southern  United  States.  The  FST  has  been  transported 
from  its  native  range,  most  likely  southern  China  [29],  to 
Japan  prior  to  the  1600s,  to  Hawaii  in  the  late  1800s  and  to 
the  continental  United  States  in  the  late  1950s  [30].  In  Lou-
isiana, FST was first documented in 1966, but was probably 
introduced  earlier  [31].  As  a  globally  successful  invasive 
species  with  a  diverse  symbiotic  bacterial  assemblage,  the 
FST is a good model for the study of the effects of introduc-
tion  upon  the  gut  microbiota.  To  date,  only  the  symbiont 
community  of  FST  in  its  introduced  range  has  been  studied 
[13, 14], and the range of variation of the symbiont commu-
nities  among  FST  colonies  has  not  yet  been  assessed  from 
either the same or from different geographical regions.  

  Comparisons  of  the  symbiont  community  among  FST 
colonies from native and  introduced populations is expected 
to reveal (1) which symbionts are obligate (i.e., they are pre-
sent  regardless  of  the  geographic  origin  of  the  termite  colo-
nies),  (2)  if  introduction  changes  the  bacterial  composition 
and/or  (3)  if  there  is  a  reduced  pathogen  load  in  introduced 
populations. Therefore, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing 
to  describe  and  compare  the  composition  of  bacterial  com-
munities in multiple FST colonies from native populations in 
China  and  introduced  populations  in  Louisiana,  U.S.A.  (de-
scribed  in  this  study)  as  well  as  in  Japan  (data  reanalyzed 
from  [14]).  Part  of  the  FST  samples  from  Louisiana  and 
China  had  been  preserved  in  ethanol  for  about  5  yrs. While 
95% ethanol has been shown to be capable of preserving the 
DNA  of  insects,  often  for  years  [32],  the  DNA  preservation 
of  the  insect  endosymbionts  has  not  yet  been  well  studied. 
Short-term  storage  of  termite  material  in  95%  ethanol  at 
room temperature did not lead to changes in the bacteria bio-
diversity  [13,  33];  however,  no  data  were  available  for  stor-
age longer  than a couple of weeks or months. Therefore, we 
also  investigated  if  long-term  ethanol  storage  may  change 
the detectable bacteria composition. 

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY 

Termite Collection  

  Three  FST  colonies  from  Louisiana,  U.S.A.,  were  col-
lected in the summers of 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively: 
sample  1  from  the  city  of  Lake  Charles,  sample  2  from 
Chalmette Battlefield, New Orleans and  sample 3 from  City 
Park,  New  Orleans.  The  guts  of  50  FST  workers  per  colony 
were  dissected  on  the  day  of  collection  (see  below).  These 
samples (1-3) are referred to as LA fresh. Additional workers 
from the FST colony from City Park were subsequently pre-
served in 95% ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, 
U.S.A.)  for  5  years  at  room  temperature  until  DNA  extrac-
tion was performed in 2008 (sample 4). Two additional FST

colonies were obtained that were collected in fall 2001 from 
Louis  Armstrong  Park  (sample  5)  and  the  French  Quarter 
(sample  6)  in  New  Orleans  and  stored  in  95%  ethanol  at 
room temperature until dissection in 2006 (5 years). Samples 
4-6  are  referred  to  as  LA  EtOH.  Three  FST  colony  samples 
from China, collected in 2001 from Hunan Province (sample 
7), Sanshui (sample 8) and Zhongshan (sample 9) (both from 
Guangdong Province) were dissected after 4-5 years of stor-
age  in  95%  ethanol  in  2005  and  2006.  These  samples  (7-9) 
are referred to as China EtOH.  

DNA Extraction and Sequencing 

 
For total DNA extraction, 50 worker guts were extirpated 
from  each  sample  and  homogenized  in  200  μl  of  TE  buffer 
(10mM  Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0) under  sterile  condi-
tions  [7].  After  centrifuging  the  mixture  at  5000  (cid:1)  g  for  10 
minutes,  the  pellet  containing  the  bacteria  was  resuspended 
in  200  μl  lysis  buffer  (20mM  Tris-HCl  (pH  8.0),  2mM  so-
dium  EDTA,  1.2%  Triton  X-100,  20  mg/ml  lysozyme)  and 
incubated overnight at 37oC. The remaining DNA extraction 
procedure  was  performed  using  the  Qiagen  DNeasy  Tissue 
Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA concentration was quanti-
fied  using  the  Thermo  Scientific  NanoDrop  1000  spectro-
photometer  (NanoDrop  Technologies,  Wilmington,  DE, 
U.S.),  and the quality of the DNA was determined using gel 
electrophoresis.  

  The  16S  rRNA  genes  of  the  gut  bacteria  were  amplified 
using  the  bacteria-specific  primer  pair  27F  (5’-AGAGTTT- 
GATCCTGGCTCAG-3’)  and  1492R  (5’-GGTTACCTTG- 
TTACGACTT-3’  [34])  in  reactions  consisting  of  1X  PCR 
buffer  (60mM  Tris-HCl,  15  mM  (NH4)2SO4,  pH  8.5  and 
2.5mM  MgCl2),  0.25  mM  dNTP,  1U  AmpliTaq  DNA  po-
lymerase  (Roche,  Indianapolis,  IN,  U.S.),  0.25  μg  of  each 
primer with approximately 10 ng of DNA template from the 
fresh  FST  samples  and  30-160  ng  from  the  ethanol-stored 
FST samples. The dNTPs were  added after heating  the PCR 
reaction  tubes  for  2-3  min  at  80oC.  Reaction  mixtures  were 
incubated in a PTC-200 thermal cycler (MJ  Research, Reno, 
NV,  U.S.)  using  the  following  program:  94oC  for  2  min;  25 
cycles of denaturation (94oC for 1 min), annealing (55oC for 
2  min)  and  extension  (72oC  for  3  min);  and  a  final  7  min 
extension  at  72oC.  PCR  products  were  purified  using  the 
UltraClean  PCR  Clean-Up  kit  (MoBio,  Solana  Beach,  CA, 
U.S.)  and  cloned  using  the  TOPO  TA  Cloning  kit  (Invitro-
gen,  San  Diego,  CA,  U.S.).  The  clones  were  grown  over-
night  on  selective  LB  media  and  clones  with  DNA  inserts 
were  selected  through  blue-white  screening.  Clones  with 
DNA inserts were bi-directionally sequenced at the Interdis-
ciplinary  Center  for  Biotechnology  Research  (ICBR)  at  the 
University of Florida (Gainesville, FL, U.S.). The full-length 
16S  rRNA  gene  sequences  were  compared  to  the  Gen-
Bank/EMBL/DDBJ  databases  using  BLAST  and  classified 
into  different  ribotypes  using  the  <97%  sequence  similarity 
criterion [35]. Chimeric sequences detected using Bellerophon 
[36],  ChimeraCheck  [37],  Mallard  [38],  signature  analysis 
and  BLAST  results  were  excluded  from  further  analyses. 
Ribotypes  were  submitted  to  the  GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ 
databases under the accession numbers GQ502463-2668. 

Classification of Ribotypes and Phylogenetic Analysis  

  Using  the  default  settings  on  the  naïve  Bayesian  rRNA 
classifier  [39]  on  the  RDP  website  [40],  the  sequences  were 

Coptotermes Formosanus Gut Bacteria

classified into the known major bacteria  lineages based on a 
confidence level of 80%. The ribotypes were named accord-
ing to the prefix Cf (Coptotermes formosanus) followed by a 
first numeral indicating the phylum classification of the ribo-
type  on  the  RDP  website  and  a  second  numeral  assigned  to 
each ribotype. Classification of the sequences was confirmed 
using  BLAST  and  reclassified  based  on  the  latest  publica-
tions.  Sequence  divergence  among  the  ribotypes  was  calcu-
lated  using  the  Kimura  2-parameter  model.  Phylogenetic 
trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method as 
implemented  in  MEGA  4.0  with  1000  bootstrap  replicates 
(Fig. 1).  

Bacterial  Ribotype  Richness,  Diversity  and  Similarity 
Analysis 

  Rarefaction  analyses  were  performed  for  bacterial  com-
munities  from  each  of  the  FST  colonies,  averaged  over  100 
randomization  runs  using  the  EstimateS  V7.5  software  [41]. 
Mao  Tau  [42]  was  used  to  measure  the  observed  ribotype 
richness  in  each  FST  colony.  To  estimate  the  percentage  of 
total  ribotypes  captured  in  each  colony,  the  non-parametric 
estimators  of  expected  ribotype  richness  based  on  the  num-
bers  of  singletons  and  doubletons  in  each  sample  (Table  1), 
Chao1  [43],  ICE  [44],  ACE  [45]  and  Jack1  [46]  were  used. 
The Simpson’s index of diversity (1-D), which is influenced 
by  abundance  since  it  reflects  the  likelihood  that  two  ribo-
types  randomly  drawn  from  the  same  sample  are  different, 
and Shannon index, which weighs both the ribotype richness 
and abundance and has a scale between 0 (low diversity) and 
~4.6 (high diversity), were used as a measure of the ribotype 
diversity.  The  similarity  of  bacterial  composition  among  the 

FST colonies was determined using the Chao-Jaccard Abun-
dance  [47],  Bray-Curtis  [48]  and  the  Morisita-Horn  indices 
[49]. All indices showed similar results. Therefore, only data 
based  on  Morisita-Horn  are  presented.  The  richness,  diver-
sity and similarity indices for each of the FST colonies were 
interpolated using rarefaction analysis to be able to compare 
all  samples  to  the  sample  with  the  lowest  number  of  clone 
samples  (123  clones,  sample  4,  Table  1)  to  avoid  biases  
due  to  unequal  sample  sizes.  Effects  of  geographical  origin 
of the FST samples (introduced vs. native range) and storage 
condition (fresh vs EtOH-stored) on ribotype richness, diver-
sity,  similarity  of  bacteria  composition  among  samples  
and  bacterial  phylum  proportions  were  tested  using  General 
Linear  Model  (GLM)  analyses;  differences  were  considered 
significant  if  two-tailed  Mann-Whitney  U  test  and  Kruskal-
Wallis  ANOVA  showed  p  <  0.05  (SPSS  17.0,  SPSS  inc., 
Chicago, IL). 

RESULTS 

Bacteria Species Inventory  

  A total of 1,876 clones containing 16S rRNA genes from 
gut  bacteria  of  nine  FST  samples  from  China  (native  range) 
and  Louisiana  (introduced  range)  were  sequenced.  Twenty-
four ribotypes consisting of 52 clones were determined to be 
artifact sequences and were excluded from subsequent analy-
ses.  The  remaining  213  bacteria  ribotypes  comprising  1,824 
clones  were  classified  into  13  bacteria  phyla:  Bacteroidetes 
(42.9% of the total clones), Firmicutes (30.5%), Spirochaetes 
(11.3%),  Actinobacteria  (5.7%),  Proteobacteria  (2.2%),

Estimators  of  ribotype  richness  (Chao1,  ICE,  ACE  and  Jack1)  and  their  95%  confidence  intervals  were  used  to  calculate  the  percentage  range  of  total  ribotypes  captured  in  each 
sample.  
The Simpson index of diversity and Shannon index were used as a measure of the ribotype diversity. Rarefaction curves were used to interpolate total estimated richness and bacteria 
diversity for each of the FST samples to compare to the sample with the lowest number of sequenced clones (123 clones, sample 4). Note that sample 3 and 4 are from the same FST 
colony, but different storage conditions.

clones)  were  endo-  or  ectosymbionts  of  other  organisms  or 
from the environment. The bacterial ribotypes were not clus-
tered according to the storage conditions of the FST samples 
(fresh vs. alcohol) or the geographic region of the FST sam-
ples (Louisiana vs. China) in the phylogenetic trees.  

  The most abundant ribotype, Cf2-30 (706 clones, 38.71% 
of  the  total  clones  analyzed),  was  classified  within  the  phy-
lum  Bacteroidetes  (Fig.  1A).  The  most  diverse  phylum  was 
the Firmicutes, with 72 bacteria ribotypes belonging to Clos-
tridia and Bacilli (Fig. 1B). The second and third most abun-
dant ribotypes, both belonged to the class Clostridia (Cf4-32: 
147 clones, 8.10% of total clones; Cf4-07, 125 clones, 6.85% 
of  the  total  clones).  The  remaining  ribotypes  occurred  in 
much  smaller  proportions,  each  comprising  less  than  1.92% 
of the total clones.  

  Of  the  213  total  ribotypes,  151  (71%)  were  considered 
novel  with  less  than  97%  sequence  similarity  to  16S  rRNA 
gene  sequences  in  the  DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank  databases. 
These novel ribotypes accounted for 30% of the total clones. 
The remaining 62 ribotypes (29%) had sequence similarities 
of  97%  or  higher  to  genes  in  public  databases.  Of  those,  33 
ribotypes  (64%  of  total  clones)  were  previously  identified 
from  the  guts  of  C.  formosanus  (including  the  three  most 
abundant  ribotypes,  Cf2-30,  Cf4-32  and  Cf4-07,  mentioned 
above),  11  ribotypes  (3%  of  total  clones)  were  from  other 
termite  guts  and  the  remaining  18  ribotypes  (3%  of  total 

  The ribotype richness and bacterial diversity of each FST 
sample  was  interpolated  for  the  lowest  clone  sample  size 
(123,  sample  4)  using  rarefaction  analysis  to  avoid  biases 
due to unequal sample sizes (Table 1). Ribotype richness per 
FST sample ranged from 23-74. However, the estimated total 
richness  is  likely  to  exceed  the  observed  ribotype  richness 
(Table  1).  Bacterial  diversity  estimated  via  the  Simpson  
index  of  diversity  ranged  from  0.49  to  0.95  per  sample.  
The  Shannon  index  ranged  from  1.46  to  3.25  (Table  1).  
A  considerable  proportion  of  ribotypes  in  each  FST  sample 
((cid:1)  9.5%,  Table  1)  were  unique,  i.e.  only  found  in  one  FST 
sample. 

  The  rarefaction  curve  of  observed  number  of  phyla  
depending  on  the  number  of  FST  samples  levels  off  and  
approaches  the  curve  of  estimated  total  number  of  phyla 
(Fig.  2).  This  indicates  that  10  FST  samples  represent  suffi-
cient sampling effort  and that the 13 phyla observed  capture 
the majority of bacterial phyla expected in the guts of FSTs. 
The continued slight incline of the accumulation curve of the 
number  of  ribotypes,  however,  suggests  that  more  ribotypes 

60    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2010, Volume 4 

might  be  discovered  if  further  FST  samples  would  be  ana-
lysed.  The  213  ribotypes  represent  at  least  55%  to  77%  of 
the estimated total number of ribotypes (Fig. 2).

Effects  of  Geographic  Origin  and  Storage  of  the  FST 
Samples  

  Ribotype  richness,  diversity  and  proportions  of  bacteria 
phyla showed a wide range among samples (Table 1), so we 
investigated  whether  this  variation  could  be  explained  by 
geographical  origin  (introduced  vs.  native  range)  or  storage 
of  the  FST  sample  (processed  immediately  vs.  stored  in 
EtOH). 

  Observed  ribotype  richness  was  not  affected  by  geo-
graphic origin (native vs. introduced range) of the samples (p 
= 0.17, F = 2.345, df = 1, 8, GLM). However, ribotype rich-
ness  was  significantly  higher  in  fresh  samples  from  LA  and 
Japan (data reanalyzed from [14]) than in EtOH-stored sam-
ples from LA and China (p = 0.038, n = 10, U = 2.000) and 
marginally  higher  in  LA  fresh  samples  than  in  LA  EtOH 
samples  (p  =  0.10,  n  =  6,  U  <  0.001,  two-tailed  Mann-
Whitney U-test). The ribotype richness of two samples from 
the same FST colony, one (sample 3) processed immediately 
after  collection  and  the  other  (sample  4)  processed  after  5 
years  of  alcohol  storage  showed  a  reduction  of  the  ribotype 
richness of almost 50% (from 74 to 40 ribotypes, Table 1).  

 
Similar  to  richness,  bacteria  diversity  measured  by  the 
Simpson  and  Shannon  indices  was  not  affected  by  geo-
graphical origin (p > 0.20, df = 1, 8 for both indices, GLM). 

Husseneder et al. 

However,  bacteria  diversity  was  significantly  affected  by 
storage condition (Simpson: p = 0.003, F = 18.535; Shannon: 
p  =  0.021,  F  =  8.259,  df  =  1,  8,  GLM).  The  bacterial  diver-
sity  in  the  fresh  samples  from  LA  and  Japan  was  signifi-
cantly  lower  than  the  diversity  of  the  EtOH-stored  samples 
from LA and China (for both 1-D and Shannon: p = 0.019, n 
=  10,  U  =  1.00).  When  comparing  the  bacterial  diversity  of 
samples  from  LA  only,  fresh  samples  still  showed  margin-
ally less diversity than EtOH-stored samples (p = 0.10, n = 6, 
U  = 0.001, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test).  

  Morisita-Horn  similarity  values  showed  that  the  propor-
tions  of  shared  bacteria  of  FST  samples  from  within  the  na-
tive range and within the introduced range were not different 
from the proportion of shared bacteria among the native and 
introduced range, i.e., the intercolonial variability of the bac-
terial  inventory,  was  not  significantly  different  within  and 
among  regions  (p  =  0.478,  U  =  13.00,  Mann-Whitney  U, 
Table  2).  However,  similarity  in  bacterial  composition 
among  samples  was  dependent  upon  whether  samples  came 
from  the  same  or  different  storage  conditions  (fresh  vs 
EtOH-preserved) (p = 0.001, F = 12.654, df = 1, 43, GLM). 
More  bacterial  species  were  shared  among  the  fresh  Louisi-
ana  FST  colonies  and  among  the  ethanol-stored  Louisiana 
FST  colonies  compared  to  those  that  were  shared  between 
the  fresh  and  ethanol-stored  Louisiana  FST  colonies  (p  = 
0.025,  U  =  5.000,  two-tailed  Mann-Whitney  U-test)  (Table 
2). A low proportion of shared species indicates that the bac-
terial  communities  found  in  the  fresh  FST  colonies  were 
somewhat distinct from the ethanol-stored FST colonies.  

 
Proportions of each of the major phyla (Bacteroides, Spi-
rochaetes, and Actinobacteria were not significantly affected 
by geographical origin of the FST samples (native vs. intro-
duced  range,  p  >  0.20,  F  <  1.32,  df  =  1,  7).  Only  the  Fir-
micutes were marginally affected by geography (p = 0.05, F 
=  5.577,  df  =  1,  7,  GLM).  However,  the  proportions  of  the 
Bacteroides (p = 0.003, F = 19.914), Firmicutes (p = 0.001, F 
= 30.621) and Actinobacteria (p = 0.022, F = 8.554, df = 1,7, 
GLM) were significantly affected by storage condition. Stor-
age  did  not  significantly  affect  the  Spirochaetes  as  long  as 
the  previously  published  low  spirochaete  proportion  of  the 
Japanese sample [14] was included in the analysis. However, 
in  a  separate  analysis  of  FST  samples  from  LA  and  China 
(excluding  Japan),  the  Spirochaetes  were  significantly  af-
fected  by  storage  condition  (p  =  0.017,  F  =  10.714,  df  =  1, 
6).  

  The  proportion  of  the  most  abundant  phylum  Bacteroi-
des, was significantly higher in the fresh samples than in the 
EtOH-stored samples (p = 0.01, Chi-Square = 6.585, df = 1, 
Kruskal-Wallis  ANOVA,  Fig.  3).  The  Spirochaetes  were 
marginally  more  abundant  in  fresh  samples  (p  =  0.05,  Chi-
Square  =  3.70,  df  =  1).  On  the  contrary,  the  gram-positive 
phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were significantly more 
abundant  in  the  EtOH  stored  samples  than  in  fresh  samples 
(p  =  0.01,  Chi-Square  =  6.59,  df  =  1  for  both  phyla).  When 
LA  samples  were  considered  separately  from  the  other  geo-
graphic  locations  the  proportions  of  Firmicutes  and  Actino-
bacteria  were  still  significantly  higher  in  EtOH-stored  sam-
ples (p = 0.04, Chi-Square = 3.97, df = 1) while Bacteroides 
and  Spirochaeta  were  marginally  higher  in  fresh  samples  
(p = 0.05, Chi-Square = 3.85, df = 1, Fig. 3).

portions of gram-negative bacteria, which were predominant 
in  the  fresh  samples,  were  reduced  in  the  EtOH-stored  sam-
ples, while the proportion of gram positive bacteria increased 
in  the  EtOH-stored  samples  (all  samples:  p  =0.01,  Chi-

  Data  from  our  study  using  multiple  colonies  across  
geographic  regions  showed  an  increase  in  the  number  of 
ribotypes  identified  in  the  FST  hindgut  of  more  than  four-
fold  compared  to  previously  published  studies  [13,  14].  We 
identified  a  total  of  213  different  ribotypes  from  eight  FST 
colonies  across  the  native  (southern  China)  and  the  intro-
duced range (Louisiana, U.S.A.), while the previous study by 
Shinzato  et  al.  [14]  found  49  ribotypes  and  9  phyla  in  one 
colony  from  Japan.  All  of  the  ribotypes  from  the  Japanese

Husseneder et al. 

FST colony were  also found in colonies from  Louisiana and 
China  plus  an  additional  164  ribotypes.  The  majority  of  the 
bacteria were novel, but closely related to bacteria previously 
found  in  the  guts  of  subterranean  termites,  supporting  the 
hypothesis  of  termite-specific  lineages  [13,  14,  21,  23-25, 
27].  

  The  most  abundant  ribotypes  were  shared  among  FST 
colonies  regardless  of 
their  geographic  origin,  which  
suggests that these particular ribotypes fulfill important roles 
within the gut of FST. The predominant ribotype in most of 
the  Louisiana  and  China  FST  samples  (Cf2-30)  was  a  Bac-
teroides  species  identical  to  BCf1-03  described  previously 
from  a  Japanese  FST  colony  [14,  50].  This  Bacteroides  
species  is  an  endosymbiont  of  Pseudotrichonympha  grassii, 
a flagellate protozoan found only in the guts of the FST [50]. 
Complete  genome  analysis  of  this  endosymbiotic  bacterium 
has  revealed  genes  for  sugar  fermentation  and  carbohydrate 
storage,  but  also  nifH  genes,  which  predict  the  ability  to  fix 
nitrogen  [51].  The  second  most  abundant  ribotype,  Cf4-32 
from  the  Clostridia  class,  was  highly  similar  to  BCf9-13 
from  the  Japanese  study  [14].  Many  clostridia  degrade  
polysaccharides to produce acetone, alcohol, acetate, lactate, 
CO2,  and  hydrogen  [52-55]  and  others  can  ferment  nitroge-
nous or lipid compounds [60]. Acetogenic clostridial species 
are  one  of  the  major  groups  in  termites  based  on  culture-
independent studies [14, 23, 25, 28, 56, 57]. 

  The  third  most  abundant  ribotype,  Cf4-07,  was  almost 
identical (99%) to Pilibacter termitis, a lactic acid bacterium 
that we previously cultured and described from a FST colony 
from  Hawaii  [58]  and  BCf6-17  in  the  Japanese  study  [14]. 
As  a  lactic  acid  bacterium  this  species  is  likely  to  be  
involved  in  sugar  fermentation  and  pH  regulation  of  the  
gut [59]. Aerotolerant lactic acid bacteria capable of efficient 
O2-reduction  also  provide  microoxic  zones  for  the  strictly 
anaerobic  microorganisms  in  the  gut  [58,  61,  62].  Several 
lactic  acid  bacteria  have  been  shown  to  recycle  carbon  and 
nitrogen by metabolizing uric acid [15].  

  The  enemy-release  hypothesis  [9],  which  would  have 
explained  invasion  success  of  FST  due  the  loss  of  pathogen 
pressure  following  introduction  to  a  new  habitat,  was  not 
applicable  to  the  gut  bacteria  community.  Only  a  small  per-
centage of the 213 ribotypes  identified in the FST gut (8 %) 
belonged  to  bacteria  other  than  from  termite-specific  linea-
ges  and  none  resembled  known  pathogens,  regardless 
whether  the  FST  samples  originated  from  the  native  or  the 
introduced  range  of  FST.  As  suggested  before,  the  highly 
adapted  gut  microflora  apparently  protects  the  termite  gut 
from invasion by pathogens and transients [1, 63]. Therefore, 
there  was  no  support  for  our  original  assumption  that  the 
FST  populations  in  China  could  be  used  as  a  resource  for 
identifying potential bacterial biocontrol agents.  

  Ribotype richness, bacterial diversity, similarity of bacte-
rial  communities  among  FST  samples,  and  proportions  of 
phyla were not  affected by the geographic origin of the FST 
samples,  whether  FST  were  collected  from  their  native 
(China)  or  introduced  range  (Louisiana  in  the  U.S.A.  and 
Japan  [14]).  This  was  surprising,  because  we  expected  that 
introduction to a new habitat would either (a) reduce richness 
and diversity of bacteria in a termite colony due to a founder 

effect or, alternatively, (b) increase richness and diversity by 
incorporating  bacteria  from  the  new  environment  and  thus 
(c) impact the similarity among colonies and the proportions 
of phyla.  

 
(a)  Previously,  we  recorded  evidence  of  founder  effects 
and  genetic  bottlenecks  in  FST  populations  from  Louisiana 
[64,  65],  which  were  attributed  to  the  introduction  of  a  lim-
ited  number  of  FST  colonies  that  established  populations  in 
Louisiana  [66].  The  genetic  diversity  was  significantly  re-
duced in termite colonies from the introduced range (U.S.A. 
mainland,  Hawaii,  and  Japan)  compared  to  those  from  the 
native  range  (China)  [67-70].  Therefore,  we  expected  to  de-
tect a similar bottleneck effect reflected in reduced symbiont 
diversity in the introduced range of FST. However, richness, 
diversity,  and  bacterial  phylum  composition  did  not  differ 
between FST samples from the native and introduced range. 
Apparently,  in  such  a  complicated  network  of  multilevel 
symbiosis as that of the termite gut, it is necessary to retain a 
certain number and composition of different bacterial species 
and phyla to support the balance and fulfill  all the important 
functions of termite nutrition and gut ecology. Although only 
a limited number of termite colonies have been introduced to 
the  United  States  [65],  each  colony  had  to  have  travelled 
with a sufficient “package” of bacterial species in the guts of 
their  workers  in  order  to  survive.  The  package  consists 
mostly  of  termite-specific  lineages  (>70%  of  the  known  
ribotypes  were  only  found  in  termites),  which  are  unable  
to  survive  outside  the  termite  gut,  but  were  obligatory  for 
termite  survival  [14,  25,  71].  Therefore,  bacteria  diversity 
was not reduced in the introduced range.  

 
(b)  If  transient  bacteria  had  been  picked  up  after  intro-
duction  to  a  new  environment,  we  would  expect  to  find  an 
increased  diversity  in  the  introduced  range.  However,  there 
is only a minute fraction of environmental bacteria present in 
the  termite  gut  (8%  of  the  ribotypes  and  3%  of  total  clones  
in  our  study).  While  some  other  social  insect  species  may 
harbor  mainly  environmental  bacteria  in  their  guts  (e.g.  red 
imported  fire  ants  [72]  and  pharaoh  ants  [73]),  termite  
gut  microorganisms  are  coadapted  and  highly  specialized 
symbionts  and  the  bacterial  community  protects  the  termite 
gut  against  invasion  by  foreign  bacteria  [1,  63].  Therefore, 
transient  bacteria  have  no  detectable  impact  on  the  overall 
bacteria  richness  and  diversity  or  major  phyla  composition 
within FST colonies.  

(c)  Given  the  recent  introduction  of  a  limited  number  of 
 
FST colonies  to similar urban habitats  in Louisiana [65], we 
also  would  have  expected  that  the  bacterial  communities 
from  colonies  from  Louisiana  would  share  more  ribotypes 
among  each  other  than  are  shared  between  colonies  from 
Louisiana  and  colonies  from  China.  However,  there  was  no 
detectable difference in the intercolonial variability of bacte-
rial  communities  from  FST  colonies  from  the  same  geo-
graphical range when compared to those from different geo-
graphical  ranges.  Although  ribotype  richness  and  diversity 
within  FST  colonies  were  similar,  the  proportion  of  shared 
bacterial  species  varied  considerably  among  FST  samples, 
even when colonies from the same geographical region were 
compared (Table 2). Field studies on colonies of Hodotermes 
mossambicus  and  several  Reticulitermes  and  Microcero- 

Coptotermes Formosanus Gut Bacteria 

The Open Microbiology Journal, 2010, Volume 4    63 

termes  species,  confirmed  that  the  bacterial  community  of 
termite  colonies  usually  differs  considerably  between  sam-
pling  sites,  even  if  colonies  were  sampled  from  the  same 
geographical region [71, 74]. 

 
Since  the  ribotype  richness  and  diversity  is  high  within 
FST  colonies,  even  a  few  introduced  FST  colonies  could 
have  carried  hundreds  of  bacteria  species.  Each  termite  col-
ony  regardless  of  geographic  origin  has  to  contain  all  the 
obligatory  functional  groups  of  symbionts  to  support  the 
energy and nutritional needs of the colony. These symbionts, 
however,  do  not  necessarily  have  to  be  identical  species,  
but  could  consist  of  closely  related  species  or  species  with 
overlapping  functions.  For  example,  sequencing  of  nitrogen 
fixation  genes  (nifH)  from  the  mixed  bacterial  population  
in  the  gut  of  termites  provided  evidence  for  the  presence  
of  an  unexpected  diversity  of  nitrogen  fixing  bacteria  and 
nitrogenases  in  the  guts  of  Reticulitermes  and  Coptotermes 
species  [16,  24]).  Acetogenesis  is  performed  by  protozoa, 
various  spirochaetes  and  clostridia-related  bacteria,  among 
others [24, 75, 76]. 

  Given  the  considerable  bacterial  diversity  in  termite 
populations,  intercolonial  variation  could  be  explained  in 
two  ways.  First,  the  bacterial  community  of  each  newly 
founded colony is expected  to be a unique mixture of bacte-
ria  provided  by  the  founding  pair  of  reproductives,  which 
likely  carry  different  bacterial  compositions  since  they  in 
most  cases  originated  from  different  colonies  [77,  78].  Sec-
ond,  once  colonies  are  established,  adaptation  to  different 
habitat  conditions  and  diet  would  further  shift  the  composi-
tion of the bacterial community. This shift  is due to changes 
in proportions of bacteria established in the gut and does not 
involve  significant  uptake  of  bacteria  from  the  environment 
(see  above).  It  has  been  shown  that  the  relative  proportions 
of  bacterial  groups  in  termite  laboratory  colonies  rapidly 
shift in response to changes in rearing conditions or diet [7]. 
Bacterial  communities  in  the  FST  were  shown  to  differ  by 
60% when comparing FST colonies fed with high molecular 
weight  carbon  sources  and  those  fed  with  low  molecular 
weight  carbon  sources  [6].  Within  the  gut  of  the  wood-
feeding  higher  termite  Nasutitermes  takasagoensis,  spiro-
chaetes  were  predominant  in  the  wood-  and  wood  powder-
fed  termites,  Bacteroidetes  were  predominant  in  the  xylan-, 
cellobiose-  and  glucose-fed  termites,  while  Firmicutes  were 
predominant in the xylose-fed termites [79]. 

  The  variances  among  the  bacterial  communities  of  FST 
colonies were not likely due to transient bacteria, which rep-
resent  only  a  minute  fraction  of  the  ribotypes  (see  above), 
nor  caused  by  partial  sampling.  The  variability  of  bacterial 
composition  among  members  of  the  same  termite  colony  is 
likely  low  [74],  because  they  exchange  bacteria  via  trophal-
laxis  and  the  obligatory  refaunation  after  molting  [80,  81]. 
Rarefaction  analyses  showed  that  the  number  of  termite 
colonies  sampled  was  sufficient  to  detect  most  of  the  phyla 
and  ribotypes  (Fig.  2).  Increasing  the  number  of  sequenced 
clones  per  sample  may  have  revealed  additional  rare  ribo-
types;  however,  the  variance  among  colonies  was  not  based 
upon  the  presence  of  rare  ribotypes.  Even  when  singletons 
and  doubletons  (Table  1)  were  excluded  from  the  analysis, 
the  variances  of  shared  ribotypes  among  the  FST  samples 
remained high. 

 
In contrast to the geographical origin of the FST samples, 
storage  of  FST  samples  in  ethanol  for  several  years  prior  to 
extraction  of  the  bacterial  DNA  did  have  an  effect  on  the 
measured  bacteria  community  parameters.  Ethanol  storage 
reduced  ribotype  richness,  but  increased  bacterial  diversity. 
This  apparent  contradiction  is  explained  by  the  fact  that  the 
Bacteroides ribotype, which is predominant in fresh samples, 
masks  the  presence  of  rare  species.  High  number  of  single-
tons  (i.e.,  ribotypes  represented  by  only  one  clone)  indicate 
that  there  may  be  a  considerable  number  of  ribotypes  in  the 
fresh  samples  that  remained  undetected.  The  abundance  of 
Bacteroidetes was reduced in  EtOH stored samples  and thus 
rare  species  were  more  likely  to  be  detected  in  the  clone  li-
brary, which increased the bacterial diversity in EtOH stored 
samples relative to fresh samples.  

  The  bacterial  phyla  that  persisted  predominantly  in  the 
EtOH-stored FST samples (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria) were 
also found in bacterial community studies of other long-term 
preserved  specimens.  In  a  study  of  ancient  bacteria  sampled 
in  permafrost  of  different  ages  (0-8.1  MYA),  DNA  of  Acti-
nobacteria were found to be the most persistent, followed by 
the  DNA  of  the  Firmicutes  classes  Bacillalaceae  and  Clos-
tridiaceae  [82].  The  proportion  of  gram-positive  bacteria 
increased approximately 50% in the permafrost samples 5-30 
kyr of age compared to fresh permafrost samples; in the 300-
600  kyr  permafrost  samples  the  whole  bacterial  community 
consisted  of  gram  positive  bacteria  [82].  In  the  intestines  of 
freeze-dried human mummies, Clostridia were dominant and 
Bacteroidetes,  which  were  abundant  in  the  intestines  of  liv-
ing  humans  [83],  were  absent.  Gram-negative  bacteria, 
which  made  up  ~40%  of  the  bacterial  community  in  the  in-
testine of living humans, dropped to ~20% in the intestine of 
a  90  year-old  mummy  and  were  almost  absent  in  a  3500 
year-old  Iceman  mummy  [83].  This  was  comparable  to  our 
study,  in  which  the  proportion  of  Bacteroidetes  and  other 
gram-negative  bacteria  decreased  substantially  in  the  FST 
samples  stored  long-term  in  ethanol.  The  higher  persistence 
of the gram-positive bacterial DNA may be  attributed  to the 
multiple  layers  of  peptidoglycan  in  their  cell  walls  [84], 
which  can  protect  the  DNA  much  better  from  the  degrada-
tion  than  the  thin  peptidoglycan  and  lipopolysaccharide  lay-
ers in the cell wall of the gram-negative bacteria [85].  

CONCLUSION 

  Data  from  this  study  using  multiple  FST  colonies  from 
the  native  and  introduced  range  increased  the  number  of  ri-
botypes known to inhabit the gut of FST four-fold (213 ribo-
types). The enemy release hypothesis (pertaining specifically 
to  the  release  from  pathogens)  could  not  be  invoked  to  ex-
plain  invasion  success  of  FST  since  no  pathogens  were 
found  among  the  bacterial  gut  community  in  the  native  and 
introduced  populations  of  FST.  Ribotype  richness,  bacterial 
diversity,  and proportions of detected phyla were  influenced 
by  storage  conditions  of  the  FST  samples,  but  not  by  their 
geographic origin. Invasion of new habitats did not have any 
detectable  impact  on  the  composition  of  the  bacterial  gut 
symbionts.  Apparently,  the  tight  co-evolutionary  link  be-
tween termites and their gut flora maintains a certain associa-
tion of species.
