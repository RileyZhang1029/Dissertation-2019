Abstract: The principal  essential bacterial cell division gene ftsZ  is differentially  expressed  through multiple  transcripts  
in  diverse  genera  of  bacteria  in  order  to  meet  cell  division  requirements  in  compliance  with  the  physiological  niche  of  
the  organism  under  different  environmental  conditions.  We  initiated  transcriptional  analyses  of  ftsZ  gene  of  the  fast  
growing saprophytic mycobacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis, as the first step towards understanding the requirements 
for  FtsZ  for  cell  division  under  different  growth  phases  and  stress  conditions.  Primer  extension  analyses  identified  four 
transcripts,  T1,  T2,  T3,  and  T4.  Transcriptional  fusion  studies  using  gfp  showed  that  the  respective  putative  promoter  
regions,  P1,  P2,  P3,  and  P4,  possessed  promoter  activity.  T1,  T2,  and  T3  were  found  to  originate  from  the  intergenic  
region between ftsZ and the upstream gene, ftsQ. T4 was initiated from the 3’ portion of the open reading frame of ftsQ. 
RT-PCR analyses indicated co-transcription of ftsQ and  ftsZ. The  four transcripts were present in the cells at  all growth 
phases and at different levels in the cells exposed to a variety of stress  conditions in vitro. T2 and T3 were  absent under 
hypoxia  and  nutrient-depleted  stationary  phase  conditions,  while  the  levels  of  T1  and  T4  remained  unaffected.  These  
studies  showed  that  ftsZ  gene  expression  through  multiple  transcripts  and  differential  expression  of  the  transcripts  at  
different growth phases and under stress conditions are conserved in M. smegmatis, like in other Actinomycetes.

INTRODUCTION 

  Eubacterial  vegetative  cell  division  by  septation  is  initi-
ated  by  the  cytoskeletal  cytokinetic  essential  protein  FtsZ 
through the formation of polymeric ring structure at the lead-
ing  edge  of  the  invaginating  septum  [1,  reviewed  in  2]. 
Maintenance  of  a  critical  level  of  FtsZ  is  obligatory  for 
proper  cytokinesis  as  less  or  excess  of  FtsZ  results,  respec-
tively,  in  filamentation  due  to  lack  of  septation  or  mini  cell 
formation  due  to  septation  at  the  poles  of  the  cells  undergo-
ing  division  [3].  Expression  of  ftsZ  gene  has  been  found  to 
be  through  co-ordinated  differential  expression  from  multi-
ple  overlapping  transcripts  from  multiple  promoters  and/or 
co-transcription  with  cell  division  genes  located  upstream  
of  ftsZ  in  diverse  bacterial  systems,  Bacillus  subtilis  [4],  
Escherichia  coli  [5-7],  Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  [8],  Coryne-
bacterium  glutamicum  [9,  10],  Shewanella  violacea  [11], 
Bartonella  bacilliformis  and  Bartonella  henselae  [12],  and 
Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  [13].  Although  the  function  of 
FtsZ  is  conserved  in  bacterial  systems,  expression  of  ftsZ 
gene  through  multiple  transcripts  has  been  found  to  differ 
markedly  among  diverse  genera  of  bacteria,  in  response  to 
different  growth  phases  and  various  environmental  stress 
conditions,  in  E.  coli  [14],  N.  gonorrhoeae  [15],  B.  subtilis

  Mycobacterium  smegmatis  is  a  saprophytic  fast-growing 
species  of  mycobacterium,  which  was  originally  isolated 
from  human  smegma,  the  natural  lubricant  produced  under-
neath  the  foreskin  of  penis  [23].  Although  it  is  not  a  human 
pathogen  unlike  M.  tuberculosis,  being  a  fast-growing  sap-
rophytic  species,  it  is  an  attractive  mycobacterial  system  to 
study regulation of expression of cell division genes, such as 
ftsZ,  in  comparison  to  those  in  slow-growing  mycobacterial 
pathogens.  In  this  regard,  we  had  earlier  studied  ftsZ  
transcription  in  the  slow-growing  pathogen, M.  tuberculosis 
[13,  24].  In  the  present  study,  the  status  of  transcription  
of  ftsZ  of  the  fast-growing  saprophytic  M.  smegmatis 
(MsftsZ)  was  determined.  Multiple  transcripts  of  MsftsZ  
were  identified,  putative  promoters  of  which  were  mapped, 
confirmed  their  promoter  activity,  detected  co-transcription 
of  MsftsZ  with  its  immediate  upstream  gene,  and  examined 
the profile of MsftsZ transcripts under different growth phase 
and  stress  conditions,  which  are  likely  to  be  experienced  by 
M. smegmatis in its natural environment. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Bacterial Strains, Media, and Culture 

  M.  smegmatis  mc2155  cells  [25]  were  grown  in  Middle-
brook  7H9  (Difco)  liquid  medium  supplemented  with  0.2%

glycerol,  0.05%  Tween  80  and  10%  Albumin-Dextrose-
Catalase  (ADC)  enrichment  or  in  Middlebrook  7H10  agar 
(Difco)  medium  supplemented  with  10%  Oleic  acid-
Albumin-Dextrose-Catalase (OADC) enrichment. The  trans-
formants of M. smegmatis cells carrying promoter constructs 
were grown in the above mentioned liquid or solid media, as 
the  case  may  be,  containing  hygromycin  at  a  concentration 
of  50  μg  ml-1.  E.  coli  JM109  cells  were  grown  in  Luria-
Bertani (LB) medium in liquid or on LB-solid agar, contain-
ing 150 μg ml-1 of hygromycin, when required. 

following  manufacturer’s 

phenol  method,  as  described  [24]  or  using  Tri-reagent 
(Sigma) 
instructions.  Primer  
extension  reactions  were  carried  out  on  3  (cid:1)g  and  5  (cid:1)g  
RNA  from  each  sample,  using  MsZPE1  and  MsZPE2  
primers  (Table  1),  as  described  [13].  Sequencing  ladders 
were generated on the sense strand PCR products of the ftsZ 
upstream  region,  which  was  amplified  from  genomic  DNA 
of M. smegmatis using primers, MsQf and MsZPE1 (Table 1). 
The  primer  extension  gel  was  exposed  to  phosphorimager 
cassette to obtain the profile. 

Culturing of Cells Under Stress Conditions 

Table 1.  Primers used in the Study 

  An  exponentially  growing M.  smegmatis  mc2155  culture 
at an OD600 nm of 0.5 was subdivided into a series of 20 ml of 
cultures,  the  cells  were  harvested,  resuspended  in  10  ml  of 
appropriate  stress  medium  and  exposed  to  stress  condition 
for  2  hrs  at  37°C  in  a  bacteriological  shaker  (except  heat 
shock culture, which was kept in non-shaking condition),  as 
described  [26].  The  stress  conditions,  10  mM  H2O2  (oxida-
tive  stress),  pH  5  (acid  stress;  1M  HCl  diluted  to  get  pH  5), 
0.05%  SDS  (detergent  stress),  and  50°C  (heat  shock),  were 
employed  as  described  [26].  Other  stress  conditions  em-
ployed  were  5  M  NaCl  (hyper-osmotic  stress)  [27]  and  0.2 
(cid:1)g ml-1 of mitomycin  C (DNA damage) [28]. Subsequent  to 
exposure  to  the  stress  conditions,  the  cells  were  harvested 
and  processed,  as  described  [26].  For  experiments  on  cells 
grown under hypoxia [29], M. smegmatis mc2155 cells were 
grown  in  Dubos  broth  base  (Difco),  supplemented  with 
ADC, and  containing methylene blue,  as described [29, 30]. 
Disappearance of methylene blue colour marked the onset of 
hypoxic  condition,  as  described  [29].  The  12th  day  hypoxia 
culture  was  harvested,  washed  in  Tween-saline  buffer 
(0.05% Tween 80  and 0.8% NaCl). Hypoxia-exposed bacte-
rial  cells  were  found  to  be  synchronised  in  growth  upon  re-
lease  from  hypoxic  state,  indicating  successful  reproduction 
of the slow-stirring model of hypoxia [29], as applied for M. 
smegmatis  cells  [30].  For  generating  nutrient-depleted  sta-
tionary phase cultures, cells were grown to an OD600 nm of 2.5 
in  a  bacteriological  shaker  and  then  kept  in  standing  condi-
tion  for  an  additional  15  days  for  the  gradual  depletion  of 
nutrients, under micro-aerophilic submerged growth. 

Growth Synchronisation of M. smegmatis Culture 

Synchronous  culture  of  M.  smegmatis  mc2155  cells  was 
 
obtained  using  phenethyl  alcohol  (PEA),  as  described  [31]. 
In  brief,  the  cells  were  grown  in  Middlebrook  7H9  (Difco) 
liquid  medium,  supplemented  with  0.2%  glycerol,  0.05% 
Tween  80,  and  10%  Albumin-Dextrose-Catalase  (ADC)  en-
richment,  up  to  OD600  nm  of  0.6.  Growth  was  arrested  upon 
treatment  with  0.4%  (final  concentration)  of  PEA  for  5  hrs. 
The  cells  were  then  washed  with  1X  PBS  (phosphate-
buffered saline, pH 7.0),  and released from growth arrest by 
re-suspending  in  fresh  medium  and  culturing  at  37°C.  Syn-
chronisation  was  ascertained  by  plating  this  culture  at  every 
30 min for 5 hrs and determining colony forming units (cfu) 
from the samples at the respective time points.

For  the  estimation  of  relative  activity  of  the  individually 
cloned promoters, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed 
for  mycgfp2+  in  M.  smegmatis  transformants  carrying  
independent  promoter-mycgfp2+  constructs  and  for  sigA 
gene  (normalisation  control),  as  described  [24].  For  RT-
PCR,  amplifications  were  carried  out  at  23  cycles  (linear 
range) for mycgfp2+ and for sigA from transcriptional fusion 
transformants, using the combinations of primers, mgfp1 and 
mgfp2  and  SigA1  and  SigA2  (Table  1),  respectively.  Total 
amount  of  ftsZ  mRNA  and  hspX  mRNA  were  detected  by 
RT-PCR  method using specific primer sets (Table 1),  MsZ1 
and  MsZ2  for  MsftsZ  and  MshspXf  and  MshspXr  for 
MshspX, respectively. The linear range for RT-PCR amplifi-
cation was 30 cycles at hypoxia and stationary phase for ftsZ 
and  hspX.  Total  RNA  was  used  to  normalise  the  amplifica-
tion. Densitometric quantitations of  the cDNA bands for the

mycgfp2+  and  sigA  mRNAs  were  carried  out  using  ImageJ 
software  (NIH,  USA),  from  atleast  three 
independent  
experiments. 

 
For  MsftsQ-MsftsZ  co-transcription  analysis,  five  (cid:1)g  of 
DNA-free  total  RNA  from  M.  smegmatis  cells,  which  were 
grown to 0.6  at OD600  nm, and 20 pmoles of  MsZPE1 primer 
were  added  and  the  volume  was  made  up  to  12.5  (cid:1)l  with 
DEPC-treated water. Denaturation of RNA was performed at 
65°C  and  snap-cooled  on  ice  for  5  min.  Two  (cid:1)l  of  10  mM 
dNTP  mix,  4  (cid:1)l  of  5x  reaction  buffer  (Fermentas),  and  20 
units  of  Ribolock  RNase  inhibitor  (Fermentas)  were  added. 
The  primer  was  annealed  at  37°C  for  5  min.  RevertAid™ 
Premium  Reverse  Transcriptase  (200  U,  Fermentas)  was 
added and extension was allowed for 1 hr at 42°C. Inactiva-
tion  of  Reverse  Transcriptase  enzyme  was  carried  out  at 
70°C for 10 min. The cDNA synthesised from MsZPE1 was 
used  for  the  RT-PCR  using  MsZPE1  in  combination  with 
MsQf  and  MsQf-665  (Table  1)  independently  to  give  prod-
ucts  of  sizes  1292  bp  and  628  bp,  respectively.  PCR  was 
performed using Taq DNA polymerase in 25 (cid:1)l reaction vol-
ume,  where  2  (cid:1)l  of  the  cDNA  reaction  mixture  was  used. 
Total RNA was used as a negative control for no DNA con-
tamination in RT-PCR reaction. 

Construction of MsftsZ Promoter Fusions 

  The  constructs  used  or  generated  in  this  study  are  listed 
in  Table  2.  The  vector  pMN406  contains  mycgfp2+  gene 
[32],  which  possesses  the  same  fluorescence  enhancing  mu-
tations  as gfp+ [33] and adapted to  the  mycobacterial codon 
usage.  The imyc promoter of  this vector was deleted  to gen-
erate  pMN406-(cid:1)Pimyc  [24].  Putative  promoters,  P1  and  P2, 
were  independently  cloned  at  the  BamHI-XbaI  sites  of 
pMN406, in place of imyc promoter, after annealing two sets 
of  complementary  oligonucleotides,  P1MsZf  and  P1MsZr 
(for  P1),  and  P2MsZf  and  P2MsZr  (for  P2),  respectively 
(Table  1).  The  two  respective  clones  were  designated, 
pMN406-(cid:1)Pimyc-P1  and  pMN406-(cid:1)Pimyc-P2.  The  putative 
116  bp  P3  promoter  was  PCR  amplified  using  primers 
P3MsZf and P3MsZr, and after sequence verification, cloned 
at  the  BamHI-XbaI  sites  of  pMN406,  in  place  of  imyc  pro-
moter,  to  generate  pMN406-(cid:1)Pimyc-P3.  For  cloning  P4,  an 
879  bp  region  containing  the  promoter  was  PCR  amplified 
using primers, MsQf and P4MsZr (Table 1). The PCR prod-
uct was cloned in pBS(KS), sequence-verified, digested with 
BamHI  and  SmaI,  and  the  resulting  253  bp  region  was 
cloned at the BamHI-SspI sites of pMN406, in place of imyc 
promoter, to generate pMN406-(cid:1)Pimyc-P4.

Flow Cytometry Analyses 

  Qualitative detection of promoter activity in M. smegma-
tis  transformants  at  exponential  phase  of  growth  (0.6  at 
OD600  nm)  was  achieved  using  flow  cytometry  analyses  of 
MYCGFP2+  protein  expressed  in  the  M.  smegmatis  mc2155 
transformants  carrying  different  MsftsZ  promoter-mycgfp2+ 
fusion  constructs,  as  described  [24].  In  brief,  the  cells  were 
harvested at different stages of growth and washed once with 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 1 ml of 
PBS.  Flow  cytometry  analysis  was  performed  using  Becton 
Dickinson FACScan machine. Dot plots were analysed using 
WinMDI software, version 2.8. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Identification of Four MsftsZ Primer Extension Products 

 
Primer  extension  analysis  on  total  RNA  from  mid-log 
phase  (0.6  at  OD600  nm)  M.  smegmatis  mc2155  cells  using 
MsZPE1 primer (Fig. 1 A; Table 1), 3’ end of which anneals 
at  19  nt  downstream  of  ‘A’  of  the  ATG  of  ftsZ,  identified 
four  primer  extension  products,  probably  corresponding  to 
four putative transcripts, which were designated, T1, T2, T3, 
and T4 (Fig. 1  B).  The presence of  T2,  T3,  and T4 was fur-
ther confirmed by extension of another primer MsZPE2 (Fig. 
1 C;  Table 1), 3’ end of  which anneals at 92 nt upstream of 
‘A’  of  ATG  of  ftsZ,  within  the  ftsQ-ftsZ  intergenic  region 
(Fig.  1  A).  The  control  experiments  using  a  mixture  of  E. 
coli  tRNA  and  single-stranded  sense-strand  DNA  did  not 
show any corresponding bands (Fig. 1  B,  lane 2),  indicating 
that  the  primer  extension  reactions  did  not  involve  either 
non-specific extension or secondary structure-related fall off 
of the enzyme. T1 starts at A-1060, which is 68 nt upstream 
of  the  ‘A’  of  the  ATG  of  ftsZ  (Fig.  2).  The  corresponding 
putative  promoter  P1  has  TAACTC  as  the  –10  sequence, 
which  is  located  7  nt  upstream  of  the  start  site  of  the  tran-
script,  and  TTGCGC  as  the  –35  sequence,  with  a  14  nt  gap 
between the putative -10 and -35 sequences (Fig. 2; Table 3). 
In  M.  smegmatis,  the  consensus  sequences  for  the  -10  and  -
35  regions  for  the  A  group  promoter  are  T94A84T63a42a42T78 
and T73T58G68a26C57a36, respectively, where the capital letters 
indicate  more  than  50%  conservation  and  the  lower  case 
letters indicate conservation between 25% and 50%, and the 
subscript  number  for  each  nucleotide  indicates  percent  con-
servation  of  the  nucleotide  [34].  Thus,  the  -10  and  -35  se-
quences  of  P1  possess  partial  consensus  to  an  A  group  pro-
moter.  The  14  bp  distance  between  -10  and  -35  sequences 
seems  to  be  a  deviation  from  the  conventional  distance  of

16-19  bp  found  in  A group  promoters  in  mycobacteria  [34]. 
Nevertheless,  there  are  several  examples  of  mycobacterial 
promoters,  where  -10  and  -35  sequences  are  separated  by 
less than 16 bp. Two such examples are the rap promoter of 
the  mycobacterial  plasmid,  pAL5000  [35],  and  the  gidB 
promoter of M. smegmatis [36], where in both the cases, the 
-10 and -35 sequences are separated by a 14 bp stretch. 

  T2  originates  at  G-1028,  which  is  99  nt  upstream  of  the 
ATG  of  ftsZ  and  within  the  -35  box  of  P1  (Fig. 2).  The  -10 
sequence  TACCGT,  which  is  7  nt  upstream  of  the  mapped 
+1  site,  possesses  partial  consensus  to  the  -10  sequence, 
T85A85NA57c42T71,  of  B  group  promoters  in  mycobacteria 
[34].  The  putative  -35  box,  CGATCA,  is  17  nt  upstream  of 
the -10 sequence, TACCGT, and is not conserved (Table 3), 
as  observed  for  B  group  of  mycobacterial  promoters  [34]. 
This makes P2 to be classified as a B group promoter. It has 
been  demonstrated  that  the  -10  regions  of  mycobacterial 
promoters  are  similar  to  those  of  E.  coli  promoters,  in  con-
trast to their -35 regions that can tolerate a greater variety of 
sequences,  presumably  owing  to  the  presence  of  multiple 
sigma factors with different or overlapping specificities for -
35  regions  [37].  Interestingly,  there  is  the  CTGCCA  se-
quence,  which  is  separated  from  the  -10  sequence  by  21  bp 

and  possessing  partial  consensus  to  the  -35  sequence 
(T73T58G68a26C57a36) of A group promoter [34]. Further, the -
10 sequence, TACCGT, also shows partial consensus to the -
10  sequence,  T94A84T63a42a42T78,  of  A  group  promoter.  In 
view  of  these  possibilities,  pending  elucidation  of  activity, 
P2 may be grouped as an A group promoter as well. Further, 
at  5  nt  upstream  of  the  T2  start  site,  P2  region  contains  a 
sequence  possessing  consensus

  T3  starts  at  A-994,  which  is  134  nt  upstream  of  the  start 
codon, ATG, of ftsZ (Fig. 2). The putative -10 box (8 nt up-
stream  of  +1  site),  TCGGCG,  and  the  -35  sequence, 
CGCAGA, are at a distance of 17 nt gap between them. The 
-10 and -35 sequences do not show consensus to any specific 
sequence  and  no  other  sequences  could  be  detected  within 
the  accepted  distances  of  expected  -10  and  -35  sequences 
from  the  transcription  start  site.  Therefore,  the  putative  pro-
moter,  which  drives  the  expression  of  T3,  pending  elucida-
tion  of  activity,  was  designated  as  P3  with  the  putative  -10

and  -35  sequences.  According  to  the  A,  B,  C,  and  D  group-
ing of promoters, the -10 and -35 sequences of C group pro-
moters do not possess any consensus, but do show promoter 
activity [34]. Therefore, P3 was classified as a C group pro-
moter.  Analysis  for  the  presence  of  repeat  sequences  using 
PALINDROME  software  identified  an  imperfect  inverted 
repeat  only  in  the  P3  region  (Fig.  2,  indicated  by  opposing 
arrows), indicating that the promoter may be subject to regu-
lation. T4 originates at G-825, which is 56 nt upstream of the 
‘G’ of the stop codon, TAG, of ftsQ and 303 nt upstream of 
the  ATG  of  ftsZ  (Fig.  2).  The  putative  -10  sequence, 
TCGCGG  (7  nt  upstream  of  +1),  and  the  -35  sequence, 
TACCCA,  are  also  spaced  by  17  nt  gap  (Fig.  2;  Table  3). 
The  -10  and  -35  sequences  of  T4  also  do  not  possess  any 
consensus  sequence.  Therefore,  the  putative  P4  promoter, 
which has been predicted to transcribe T4, was classified as a 
C group promoter [34], pending elucidation of activity. 

T1, T2, T3, and T4 are True Transcripts 

 
In  order  to  verify  whether  T1,  T2,  T3,  and  T4  are  true 
transcripts  originating  from  authentic  promoters  or  whether 

they are RNA processed products, the regions encompassing 
–10  and  -35  sequences,  and  +1  start  sites,  of  the  putative 
promoter  regions,  P1,  P2,  P3,  and  P4  (Figs.  2,  3  A),  were 
individually cloned in pMN406-(cid:1)Pimyc (containing mycgfp2+ 
reporter gene, but without Pimyc promoter; 13, 24) upstream 
of  mycgfp2+  reporter  gene.  Flow  cytometry  analyses  for 
MYCGFP2+  expression  in  the  independent  M.  smegmatis 
transformants revealed that P1, P2, P3, and P4 drove expres-
sion  of  mycgfp2+  (Fig.  3  B).  Noticeably,  expression  from 
pMN406-(cid:1)Pimyc-P1, pMN406-(cid:1)Pimyc-P2 and pMN406-(cid:1)Pimyc-
P4  were  comparably  equivalent  at  60%  –  70%  higher  level 
of expression, in comparison to the vector control cells (con-
taining  pMN406-(cid:1)Pimyc)  at  the  exponential  phase  of  growth. 
On  the  contrary,  expression  from  pMN406-(cid:1)Pimyc-P3  was 
significantly  low  (19%)  (Fig.  3  B).  MYCGFP2+  expression 
confirmed that P1, P2, P3, and P4 indeed possessed promoter 
activity. These observations confirmed that the putative tran-
scripts  T1,  T2,  T3,  and  T4  were  authentic  transcripts  that 
originated  from  the  authentic  promoter  regions,  P1,  P2,  P3, 
and  P4,  which  were  predicted  based  on  5’  end  mapping  of 
the  transcripts.  It  may  be  recalled  here  that  P2  promoter, 
pending elucidation of activity, could earlier be classified as

a B or A group promoter, based on whether the -35 sequence 
was  CGATCA  (17  nt  away  from  -10  sequence;  B  group)  or 
CTGCCA  (21  nt  away  from  -10  sequence;  A  group).  How-
ever,  the  oligonucleotide  used  for  cloning  the  putative  P2 
promoter  (predicted  as  belonging  to  B  group  of  promoters) 
contained  the  complete  -35  sequence  of  CGATCA  of  B 
group promoter, but only the partial 4 nucleotides, GCCA, of 
the  -35  sequence  of  CTGCCA  of  the  A  group  promoter. 
Since the P2 promoter, which was cloned using this oligonu-
cleotide, showed 70% higher levels of activity, compared to 
the negative control (Fig. 3 B), the authentic -35 sequence of 
P2 promoter might be CGATCA, and not CTGCCA, thereby 
classifying it as a B group promoter (Table 3). 

 
It  may  be  noted  here  that  GFP  being  a  protein  having 
long half-life, the levels of MYCGFP2+ expression was con-
sidered only as a means for the detection of promoter activity 
and not for the quantitative evaluation of the contribution of 
activity from the individual promoters. Therefore, in order to 
measure  the  relative  levels  of  activity  of  the  individual  pro-
moters, the levels of mycgfp2+ mRNA produced by the four 
individually  cloned  promoter  regions  were  measured.  For 
this  purpose,  semi-quantitative  RT-PCR  was  carried  out  on 
the total RNA isolated from the M. smegmatis transformants, 

carrying  the  promoter-reporter  gene  constructs,  at  the  expo-
nential  phase  of  growth  (0.5  at  OD600  nm).  The  levels  of  ex-
pression  of  mycgfp2+  mRNA  was  detected  and  normalised 
with  respect  to  the  level  of  expression  of  sigA  as  described 
earlier [13, 24]. The levels of expression from P1, P2 and P4 
were found to be comparably equivalent (Fig. 3 C).  Expres-
sion from P3 was found to be lower than that from P1 or P2 
(about  1.3-fold  lower,  P  value  0.0058,  SD  0.015)  and  P4 
(about  1.6-fold  lower,  P  value  0.0009,  SD  0.01)  (Fig.  3  C). 
However, it may be noted here that the actual level of activ-
ity of a promoter could be very different in the genomic con-
text  in  vivo  than  from  the  cloned  minimal  region  containing 
+1, -10, and -35 sequences upstream of mycgfp2+. 

  The  ftsZ  gene  has  been  found  to  get  expressed  through 
multiple  transcripts  in  many Gram-positive bacterial genera, 
B.  subtilis  [4],  C.  glutamicum  [9,  10],  Streptomyces  species 
[17, 18, 41], and M. tuberculosis [13], and in Gram-negative 
bacteria,  E.  coli  [5-7,  42],  N.  gonorrhoeae  [8],  S.  violacea 
[11],  and B.  bacilliformis  and  B.  henselae  [12].  The  organi-
sation  of  the  region  spanning  ftsQ  open  reading  frame-
intergenic region-ftsZ open reading frame, is conserved in all 
mycobacterial  species  and  in  lower  Actinomycetes  species. 
Similarly,  the  presence  of  multiple  ftsZ  promoters  and  their

organisation,  which  were  found  conserved  in  Streptomyces 
species [17, 18, 41], Corynebacterium [10], and M. tuberculosis 
[13],  was  present  in  M.  smegmatis  also.  Since  Streptomyces 
species,  Corynebacterium,  and  Mycobacteria  belong  to 
Actinomycete  family,  it  is  possible  that  the  similarity  in  the 
organisation  of  multiple  promoters  and  the  pattern  of  trans- 
cription  of  ftsZ  from  multiple  promoters  in  these  members  
of  Actinomycete  family  (Streptomyces,  Corynebacterium, 
and  Mycobacteria)  probably  might  have  originated  from  a 
common ancestral pattern. 

Co-Transcription of MsftsQ and MsftsZ 

 
Presence  of  transcript  originating  in  the  ftsQ  region  and 
apparent  absence  of  any  transcription  terminator  sequence 
within  the  ftsQ-ftsZ  intergenic  region  were  indicative  of  the 
possibility that  ftsQ and  ftsZ might be getting co-transcribed 
in M. smegmatis. In order to verify such a possibility, cDNA 
was generated using MsZPE1 primer on total RNA from M. 
smegmatis mc2155 cells (Table 1; Fig. 4 A). The cDNA was 
amplified  independently  using  two  sets  of  primer  pairs. 
These  were  MsQf  and  MsZPE1  pair  and  MsQf-665  and 
MsZPE1  pair  (Table  1;  Fig.  4  A).  The  MsQf  and  MsZPE1 
pair  would  yield  1292  bp  product  (1002  bp  +  246  bp  +  44 
bp),  spanning  MsftsQ  ORF  (1002  bp),  MsftsQ-MsftsZ  inter-
genic  region  (246  bp),  and  44  bp of  the  5’  region  of MsftsZ 

ORF  (Fig. 4  A).  Similarly,  the  MsQf-665  and  MsZPE1  pair 
would give 628 bp product (338 bp + 246 bp + 44 bp), com-
prising  of  3’  region  of  MsftsQ  (338  bp),  MsftsQ-MsftsZ  in-
tergenic  region  (246  bp),  and  5’  region  of  MsftsZ  ORF  (44 
bp) (Fig. 4 A). These two primer sets gave the expected size 
products  of  1292  bp  and  628  bp,  respectively  from  the 
cDNA  (Fig.  4  B,  lanes  2  and  4,  respectively).  The  same 
primer  sets  were  also  used  for  PCR  on  genomic  DNA  to 
yield  same  products,  1292  bp  and  628  bp,  as  positive  con-
trols  (Fig.  4  B,  lanes  1  and  3,  respectively).  The  template-
minus  negative  control  sample  (RNA  alone)  did  not  yield 
any  PCR  product  (Fig.  4  B,  lane  5).  These  observations  re-
vealed  that  MsftsQ  and  MsftsZ  are  co-transcribed  in  M. 
smegmatis mc2155 cells. 

  Although  the  farthest  MsftsZ  promoter  that  has  been 
mapped in this study is P4, which is in the reading frame of 
the  upstream  gene,  MsftsQ,  co-transcription  of  MsftsQ  and 
MsftsZ  indicates  the  possibility  that  the  promoter(s)  of 
MsftsQ are likely to be involved in controlling the expression 
of  MsftsZ  as  well,  through  co-transcription  with  MsftsQ. 
Such instances of co-transcription of ftsZ with upstream gene 
and  controlled  by  far  upstream  promoters  have  been  docu-
mented  in  many  bacterial  genera.  For  instance,  in  E.  coli,  a 
large  proportion  of  the  ftsZ  transcription  comes  through  co-
transcription  from  two  promoters,  ftsQ2p  and ftsQ1p,  which

are located 5’ to the second upstream gene, ftsQ [5, 6, 7, 14]. 
Similarly,  in  N.  gonorrhoeae,  one  promoter  that  is  5’  to  the 
second  upstream  gene,  ftsQ,  drives  expression  of  ftsZ  as  a 
co-transcript  with  ftsQ  [8].  Low  abundance  transcription  of 
C.  glutamicum  ftsZ  was  observed  as  a  bicistronic  mRNA 
from  a  promoter  5’  to  the  upstream  ftsQ  gene  [10].  One  of 
the  promoters,  from  which  B.  subtilis  ftsZ  is  transcribed,  is 
located 5’ to  the upstream gene, ftsA [4]. Four transcripts of 
B.  bacilliformis  ftsZ  are  synthesised  as  co-transcripts  with 
upstream  genes  [12].  Thus,  the  trend  of  co-transcription  of 
ftsZ  with  the  upstream  gene  under  the  control  of  upstream 
promoters is conserved in the transcription of MsftsZ also. 

MsftsZ Transcripts Under Different Growth Phases 

  Various  growth  phase-specific  alterations  in  the  number 
of ftsZ  transcripts have been reported in many bacterial sys-
tems. For instance, in E. coli, while all the five  ftsZ promot-
ers are active during exponential phase of growth, the ftsQ1p 
promoter,  which  is  weakly  active  during  exponential  phase, 
gets strongly induced during stationary phase [43]. Similarly, 
in B. subtilis, while the promoters, P1 and P3, are active during 
vegetative  phase,  P2  gets  activated  only  during  sporulation 
[16].  In  the  lower  Actinomycete,  C.  glutamicum,  all  the  five 
promoters  of  ftsZ  are  active  only  during  exponential  phase 
and  are  down-regulated  during  stationary  phase  [19].  While 
the  ftsZ2p  promoter  in S.  coelicolor  is  essential  for  sporula-
tion  but  not  for  vegetative  growth  [18],  in  S.  griseus,  the 
Pveg  promoter  is  active  moderately  during  vegetative 
growth, but gets switched off within the first 2 hrs of sporu-
lation  and,  instead,  two  sporulation-specific  transcripts  are 
synthesised  up  to  5-fold,  shortly  before  the  formation  of 
sporulation  septa  [41].  For  these  reasons,  and  M.  smegmatis 

Roy et al. 

being a member of the Actinomycete family to which Strep-
tomyces  and  Corynebacterium  belong,  it  was  of  interest  to 
find out whether all the four transcripts, T1, T2, T3, and T4, 
and/or whether any new MsftsZ transcripts were synthesised 
under  different  growth  phases.  In  order  to  study  the  profile 
of  MsftsZ 
transcripts  under  different  growth  phases, 
phenethyl  alcohol  (PEA)  was  used  to  synchronise  M.  smeg-
matis cells in culture, as described [31]. Release from PEA-
mediated  growth  arrest  showed  synchronous  progression  of 
cells  through  growth  and  cell  division  (Fig.  5  A),  indicating 
successful  synchronisation  using  PEA.  The  cells  in  the  syn-
chronised culture were consistently found to start division by 
150  min  post-release  and  finish  division  by  210  min,  with 
the 0 time point being the time point at which the cells were 
released into fresh medium, post-exposure to PEA. 

 
Primer  extension  was  carried  out  on  3  (cid:1)g  of  total  RNA 
isolated from the cells harvested at 0 min, 150 min, 210 min, 
and  240  min  (a  time  point  that  is  beyond  one  division  cycle 
of  about  3  hrs  for  M.  smegmatis  cells).  All  the  four  tran-
scripts, T1, T2, T3, and T4, were present in growth-arrested 
cells as well as at all the phases of growth and division, post-
release from PEA block (Fig. 5 B). However, relative densi-
tometric quantitation of the transcript bands, generated from 
the  same  amount  of  RNA  (Fig.  5  B,  lower  panel),  showed 
that the ratio of T2 at 0 min post-release to T2 of exponential 
phase  (0.57  ±  0.03)  was  significantly  low  (P  value,  0.0001-
0.0003) in all the repeat experiments (n = 3), as compared to 
the same at other time points (0.95 ± 0.04 at t = 240, 0.92 ± 
0.02 at t = 210 and 0.87 ± 0.02 at t = 150). The ratio of T2 at 
0 min post-release to T2 of exponential phase also showed a 
gradual  recovery  from  t  =  0  (0.57  ±  0.03)  to  t  =  150  min 
(0.87 ± 0.02), prior to division. The ratio of the levels of T2

at t = 210 to that of T2 at exponential phase (0.92 ± 0.02) or 
at  t  =  240  to  that  of  T2  at  exponential  phase  (0.95  ±  0.04), 
after  division,  becomes  comparable  to  the  levels  of  T2  at 
exponential phase. Such changes were not found for T1, T3, 
and T4. These observations indicate that even though all the 
transcripts  are  synthesised  at  various  phases  of  synchronous 
growth,  T2  expression  is  significantly  reduced  upon  growth 
arrest, which over a period, gradually becomes normal, prior 
to  division  and  subsequent  growth.  However,  it  is  not  clear 
whether  this  reduction  is  a  manifestation  of  growth  arrest-
specific  change  in  the  transcription  from  P2  promoter  or  a 
stress response effect on P2 promoter due to growth arrest by 
PEA. 

MsftsZ Transcripts Under Different Stress Conditions 

  Besides  growth  phase-specific  changes  in  ftsZ  expres-
sion,  it  has  been  reported  that  altered  expression  of ftsZ  can 
influence  cytokinesis,  resulting  in  cell  division  modulation 
under  stress  conditions.  For  instance,  among  the  three  N. 
gonorrhoeae  ftsZ  transcripts,  Pz1,  Pz2,  and  Pz3,  Pz1  alone 
was  expressed  prominently  and  strongly  under  anaerobic 
condition  [8,  15].  Reduction  in  expression  of  all  the  tran-
scripts was observed in the presence of urea, which is one of 
the  stress  conditions  that  exist  in  the  environment  of  the 
genitourinary  tract  [15].  Similarly,  in  S.  coelicolor  A3(2), 
which comes under Actinomycete family to which mycobac-
teria  belong,  the  transcript  from  ftsZ2p  promoter  was  pre-
dominantly expressed during nutrient stress leading to sporu-
lation  (vegetative  growth  inhibition)  and  inactivation  of  the 
promoter was found to affect sporulation septation [18]. The 
in vitro and in vivo stress conditions, namely heat shock, acid 
stress,  oxidative  stress,  detergent,  osmotic,  DNA  damage, 

hypoxia,  and  nutrient-depleted  stationary  phase  are  experi-
enced  by  the  pathogen,  M.  tuberculosis,  in  human  host  
[26-29]. M. smegmatis, although a saprophyte, has also been 
found  to  mount  response  to  some  of  these  stress  conditions 
in  a  manner  comparable  to  that  mounted  by M.  tuberculosis 
[27,  30].  For  these  reasons,  it  was  of  interest  to  find  out 
whether  all  the  four  transcripts,  T1,  T2,  T3,  and  T4,  and/or 
whether any new MsftsZ transcript(s) were synthesised under 
different stress conditions. 

 
For  this  purpose,  total  RNA  was  isolated  from  M.  smeg-
matis  cells  exposed  individually  to  heat  shock,  acid  stress, 
oxidative  stress,  detergent  stress,  osmotic  stress,  and  DNA 
damage  stress  in  vitro,  and  from  cells  under  hypoxia  and 
nutrient-depleted  stationary  phase  in  vivo.  Primer  extension 
analyses  were  carried  out  with  MsZPE1  primer  (Fig.  1  A; 
Table  1)  on  3  (cid:1)g  of  total  RNA  from  each  sample.  The  T1, 
T2,  T3,  and  T4  transcripts  were  present,  with  some  changes 
in  their  levels,  under  all  the  in  vitro  stress  conditions.  Be-
sides  the  identified  4  transcripts,  no  new  transcript(s)  could 
be  detected  (Fig.  6  A).  Relative  densitometric  quantitation 
from  several  gels  for  each  band  indicated  that  the  levels  of 
T2  and  T3  transcripts  varied  under  different  stress  condi-
tions.  While  T1  and  T4  transcripts  remained  unaffected,  T3 
transcript level was found slightly reduced under most of the 
stress conditions. T2 level was found to be low under all the 
conditions and could barely be detected under SDS stress. In 
order  to  determine  the  general  relative  trend  in  the  stress 
responsiveness of P2 promoter with respect to P1, under heat 
shock,  semi-quantitative  RT-PCR  was  carried  out  on  total

of mycgfp2+ to sigA remained constant for P1 transcriptional 
fusion  at  exponential  phase  and  under  heat-shock  condition, 
activity  of  P2  (measured  by  RT-PCR  for  mycgfp2+  to  sigA 
mRNA)  was  found  reduced  by  1.6-fold.  This  indicated  that 
in vitro stress conditions such as heat shock do affect differ-
ential expression of ftsZ transcripts, as revealed in the primer 
extension assay. 

 
Similarly, under hypoxia and nutrient-depleted stationary 
phase conditions, only T1 and T4 transcripts, but not T2 and 
T3 or any new transcript(s), were present in the cells (Fig.  6 
B,  C).  In  order  to  test  whether  the  differential  expression  of 
ftsZ by different promoters was really reflected in the differ-
ential  levels  of  ftsZ  mRNA,  the  levels  of  ftsZ  mRNA  (nor-
malised  with  respect  to  total  RNA)  were  determined  using 
semi-quantitative  RT-PCR  on  total  RNA  from  the  cells  un-
der  hypoxia  and  nutrient-depleted  stationary  phase  of 
growth. About 50% reduction in  the total ftsZ mRNA levels 
was  observed  during  hypoxia  and  nutrient-depleted  station-
ary phase of growth, compared to that in exponential culture. 
The  hspX  mRNA,  which  is  the  molecular  marker  upregu-
lated  under  this  condition  in  mycobacteria  [44-48],  showed 
2-fold  increase,  confirming  that  the  cells  were  indeed  under 
hypoxia.  These  observations  indicated  that  there  was  reduc-
tion  in  the  level  of  ftsZ  expression  through  the  modulation  
of  the  expression  of  P2  and  P3  promoters  in  M.  smegmatis 
cells  under  nutrient-depleted  stationary  phase  and  hypoxic 
conditions of growth. 

  Thus,  taken  together,  differential  expression  of ftsZ  gene 
through  multiple  transcripts  and  through  co-transcription 
with  the  immediately  upstream  gene  are  conserved  in  M. 
smegmatis, as in other diverse bacterial genera, especially in 
other Actinomycetes to which M. smegmatis belong. In addi-
tion to the differential expression of transcripts, it is possible 
that  the  transcripts  are  differentially  processed  and/or  trans-
lated,  thereby  modulating  FtsZ  protein  levels  and  affecting 
cytokinesis,  as  critical  levels  of  FtsZ  are  essential  for  septa-
tion [3]. Nevertheless, as in other bacterial systems, differen-
tial  expression  of  ftsZ  gene  from  multiple  promoters  might 
facilitate  regulation  of  cell  division  at  different  growth 
phases  and  in  response  to  various  environmental  stress  con-
ditions, which M. smegmatis might be exposed to.
