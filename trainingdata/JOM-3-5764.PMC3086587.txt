Background: Porphyromonas gingivalis strains are shown to invade human cells in vitro with different invasion
efficiencies, varying by up to three orders of magnitude.
Objective: We tested the hypothesis that invasion-associated interstrain genomic polymorphisms are present
in P. gingivalis and that putative invasion-associated genes can contribute to P. gingivalis invasion.
Design: Using an invasive (W83) and the only available non-invasive P. gingivalis strain (AJW4) and whole
genome microarrays followed by two separate software tools, we carried out comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH) analysis.
Results: We identified 68 annotated and 51 hypothetical open reading frames (ORFs) that are polymorphic
between these strains. Among these are surface proteins, lipoproteins, capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis
enzymes, regulatory and immunoreactive proteins, integrases, and transposases often with abnormal GC
content and clustered on the chromosome. Amplification of selected ORFs was used to validate the approach
and the selection. Eleven clinical strains were investigated for the presence of selected ORFs. The putative
invasion-associated ORFs were present in 10 of the isolates. The invasion ability of three isogenic mutants,
carrying deletions in PG0185, PG0186, and PG0982 was tested. The PG0185 (ragA) and PG0186 (ragB)
mutants had 5.1103-fold and 3.6103-fold decreased in vitro invasion ability, respectively.
Conclusion: The annotation of divergent ORFs suggests deficiency in multiple genes as a basis for
P. gingivalis non-invasive phenotype.

Genomic differences among subspecies account

for many important pathogenic traits. With the
release of more and more microbial genome
databases, it has become clear that limited information
related to pathogenic properties can be mined from a
genomic database alone. A genomic sequence per se can
reveal only a limited number of mechanisms to explain
bacterial virulence properties. However, techniques such
as gene expression profiling and comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH, or also ‘genomotyping’), both

utilizing DNA microarrays, can now facilitate genome-
wide assessment of relative gene expression levels as well
as strain-to-strain comparisons. In an investigation of
Campylobacter jejuni, a genome comparison using micro-
bial microarrays revealed loci absence/divergence (1).
Genomic analysis using microarrays in Salmonella re-
vealed genes acquired horizontally by the genomic
database strain that may be associated with enteric
infections in humans (2) and genomic islands that
distinguish different serovars (3). These achievements

prompted us to utilize CGH of P. gingivalis whole
genome microarrays for assessment of genome poly-
morphisms underlying the different endothelial cell inva-
sion phenotypes. A whole-genome approach such as that
used in this study is a practical method to reveal the
genetic determinants ‘missing’ from the non-invasive P.
gingivalis strains.

Background
Porphyromonas gingivalis has been strongly implicated as
an etiologic agent of periodontitis (4) and recent evidence
suggests its association with atherosclerosis (5). Although
P. gingivalis is also detected in healthy (non-periodontitis)
individuals,
it is considered an endogenous pathogen
(6, 7). Among numerous other virulence properties, P.
gingivalis has been shown to invade multiple cell types
including animal cell lines, human vascular and oral cell
lines (811). The intracellular environment shields the
organism from host defenses, while allowing it
to
replicate and modify the host immune response (12).

Invasion of non-phagocytic cells is very likely a key
virulence factor for this bacterium as it provides (1) a
‘privileged niche’ with access to host protein (nutritional)
and iron substrates, (2) a sequestration from the humoral
and cellular immune responses, and (3) a means for
persistence that is essential for a chronic pathogen. Oral
tissues are likely the primary sites for P. gingivalis
infection but this bacterial species can enter the circula-
tion through the microvasculature following tooth brush-
ing and other dental procedures (13, 14). The invasion of
human endothelial and epithelial cells by P. gingivalis has
been well established (11, 15). There is strong evidence
that P. gingivalis disseminates to the large vessels since
P. gingivalis DNA can be detected in atheromas by PCR
(16). More importantly, it has been reported that only
invasive P. gingivalis strains accelerate atherosclerosis
in a murine model (17). Accordingly, we have detected
viable P. gingivalis in atheromatous vascular tissue (18)
(Rafferty et al., in press). We have also shown, using
immunofluorescent staining of internalized bacteria, P.
gingivalis invasion of and transmission between vascular
cell types (19). It is thus our overall hypothesis that P.
gingivalis actively interacts with the gingival endothelia in
vivo initially, but then a subset of strains or clonotypes
disseminate and establish an invasive infection in the
systemic vasculature.

In an extensive study of P. gingivalis invasion of human
cell types, several strains were demonstrated to be fully
competent of invading these cells in vitro (20). However,
there was a wide variation in invasion abilities within
these strains, varying by as much as three orders of
magnitude, as evident with the strain AJW4’s (the ‘non-
invader’) very low invasion ability (11). The AJW4 had

Publication of

the lowest invasion ability among 27 strains in the tested
cell lines thus making it the target of this study. Never-
theless, only a few P. gingivalis determinants of invasion
have been identified, with the most studied among them
being fimbrillin, the major fimbriae protein (21). Using a
genetic approach, several other genes have been investi-
gated for their potential contribution to invasion. A
phosphoserine phosphatase mutant of P. gingivalis was
shown to be deficient in cell culture invasion (22), as was
a mutant of clpB (23), htrA (24), PepO, ATPase, and
ABC transporter (25) while a gingipain-null mutant was
less potent at invading in vitro mucosal tissue model (26).
the complete 2,343,476-bp genome
sequence of P. gingivalis strain W83 (27) lead to the
availability of DNA microarrays for this organism. Seven
communications reporting data obtained using these
whole-genome micro arrays have been published so far.
They have analyzed P. gingivalis genes induced during
attachment to the human epithelial cell line HEp-2 (28),
identified quorum-sensing genes (29), and genes differ-
entially regulated during accretion of P. gingivalis
in heterotypic biofilms with Streptococcus gordonii (30).
A comparative genomics study focused on the genomic
differences that determine virulence in a mouse model
and identified over 150 divergent genes (31). Microarrays
were also used to characterize the response of P. gingivalis
to H2O2 (32) and identified 62 P. gingivalis W83 genes
that were differentially regulated during invasion of
primary human endothelial
(11 up-regulated
and 51 down-regulated)
(33). No genomotyping of
P. gingivalis has been performed related to invasion.

cells

The differential seen in P. gingivalis strains prompted
us to initiate the present study, designed to identify
genetic determinants that may be responsible for the
P. gingivalis invasive phenotype relative to vascular cells.
Thus, our hypothesis is that one of the most important
P. gingivalis virulence traits, host cell invasion is geneti-
cally determined. We examined this by using microbial
microarrays, genomic analysis of clinical isolates, bacter-
ial genetics, and in vitro assays.

Materials and methods

Bacterial strains and cell lines
strains W83, 381, A7436,
Porphyromonas gingivalis
AJW2, and AJW4 as well as the tested clinical isolates
were grown anaerobically at 378C on blood agar plates
(BAP) and in Tryptic Soy Broth (Difco/BD, USA)
supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract, 0.05% L-cysteine,
0.05 mg/ml hemin and 0.1 mg/ml vitamin K1. DNA from

from A. Progulske-Fox; AJW2 and clinical isolates #6, 9,
10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 25 were kind gifts from
V. Haraszthy; and isogenic mutants of PG0185 and
PG0186 (35) were kind gifts from Y. Murakami.

HMEC-1, an immortalized non-cancerous human
microvascular endothelial cell
line (36) was grown in
EBM-2 endothelial cell growth medium, supplemented
with EGM-2 SingleQuots (Cambrex BioScience, USA).
KB (ATCC CCL 17), a HeLa-derived continuous cell line
was cultured in Dulbecco MEM (DMEM) medium. The
media were supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml
penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin.

Antibiotic protection assay
Gentamicin/metronidazole killing was performed in bio-
logical triplicates essentially as described (8). Briefly, 105
tissue culture cells growing overnight in 24-well plates
were infected with the P. gingivalis strain (W83, AJW2,
AJW4, W83, or mutants W83DPG0185, W83DPG0186,
and W83D0982) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100
for 1.5 hours. After washing with PBS, cells were
incubated in DMEM with 300 mg/ml gentamicin and
200 mg/ml metronidazole for 1 hour and then lysed in
1 ml of sterile ddH2O for 20 min at room temperature.
The released bacteria were pelleted at 16,000g for
10 min before plating on blood agar plates (BAP) and
incubating anaerobically for 5 days at 378C. The resulting
colonies were enumerated and statistical significance was
analyzed using Student’s t-test.

P. gingivalis microarray comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH)
The P. gingivalis microarray slides based on strain W83
genomic sequence were obtained from the Pathogen
Functional Genomics Research Center (PFGRC) at J.C.
Venter Institute (JCVI, formerly The Institute for Geno-
mic Research, TIGR). The full genome array consists of
1907 70-mer oligonucleotides that were designed based
on predicted ORFs from the annotation of strain W83.
Detailed information regarding the slides and the proto-
cols used can be found at JCVI web site http://
pfgrc.jcvi.org.

GenomicDNApurification,labelingandhybridization
The P. gingivalis genomic DNA for analysis was extracted
from strains W83, 381, A7436, AJW2, and AJW4 using
the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s
instructions. Strain W83 and AJW4
genomic DNA labeling, prehybridization, and hybridiza-
tion was performed using protocols utilized by JCVI. In
short, genomic DNA was digested with BfuCI (New
England Biolabs, USA), 1 unit/1 mg of DNA for 5 min on
ice to average fragment sizes of 25 Kb. For a 39 ml
reaction, 4 mg of DNA was combined with 3 mg of

random hexamers (Invitrogen, USA), incubated at 1008C
for 10 min, and chilled on ice. The volume of reaction was
adjusted to 50 ml by adding the components to final
concentration as follows: 1 Eco Pol (Klenow) buffer,
0.2 mM dNTP/aa-UTP labeling mix (Invitrogen/Sigma),
and 20 units of the Klenow fragment (NEB). After
overnight incubation in a 378C water bath, Klenow
fragment was inactivated by adding 5 ml of 0.5 M
EDTA. Unincorporated aa-dUTP and free amines were
removed using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen). La-
beled DNA was eluted with 60 ml of 0.1 M KPO4 buffer,
pH 8.5 and dried in a Speed Vac for 1 hour. The dried
DNA pellet was dissolved in 4.5 ml of 0.1 M sodium
carbonate buffer, pH 9.3 and 4.5 ml of the appropriate Cy
dye (Amersham, USA) was added. After incubation in
dark for 1 hour at room temperature, dye-coupled DNA
samples were purified with a PCR purification kit
(Qiagen), eluted with 60 ml of PE buffer, and dried in a
Speed Vac for 1 hour. The pellet was resuspended in 60 ml
of hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide/
5XSSC/1%SDS and 0.5 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm
DNA. Before hybridization, the labeled DNA was heated
twice at 958C for 5 min. Independently labeled genomic
DNA was used for each slide. Microarray prehybridiza-
tion, hybridization and stringency washes were performed
according to JCVI/TIGR protocol http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/
index.php/microarray/protocols.html.

Data generation and analysis
Hybridized and washed slides were scanned for Cy3 and
Cy5 fluorescence intensities using Agilent microarray
scanner. The TIF format images were analyzed using
GenePix 6.0 software (Molecular Devices Corporation,
Sunnyvale, USA) producing GPR format image files.
Data was assembled from four independent array experi-
ments. Data were log2-transformed and normalized using
GINKGO 1.0 software (LOWESS and Histogram Mode
Centering from JCVI, at PFGRC, cmr.jcvi.org). Addi-
tionally, background correction and the within-array
(LOWESS) and between arrays (Aquantile) image data
normalization resulting in a table with numerical values
were carried out using SAOPMD (Significance Analysis
for Oral Pathogen Microarray Data) software tool at
www.brop.org/.

An M-value, representing the log2 of control/tester
fluorescent intensity signal ratio was assigned to each
gene and used to determine the divergence between the
control (W83) and the tester (AJW4) strain. GINKGO
and SAOPMD were both used for the same purpose and
the results from the two analyses were combined for a list
of ORFs not found in the non-invasive strain using this
approach. The annotation files for these ORFs are
available at http://cmr.jcvi.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/Genome

PCR verification of W83 genes absent in the non-
invasive AJW4 strain
To validate the microarray data, PCR confirmation of
selected ORFs not found in the non-invading strain was
performed. Five amplifications were performed with
gene-specific primers for selected ORFs. For oligonucleo-
tide design, PrimerQuest software (Integrated DNA
Technologies, Inc., USA, http://www.idtdna.com/Scitools/
Applications/Primerquest/Default.aspx)
Primer-
BLAST designing tool (NCBI) were used. The primers
are listed in Table 1. Platinum Blue PCR Polymerase
Super mix (Invitrogen) was used in a PCR protocol
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We ampli-
fied across putative deletions identified by the microarray
data in both low-invasive P. gingivalis strains AJW4 and
AJW2. As positive control, amplification using genomic
DNA template from P. gingivalis strains W83, 381, and
A7436 was performed. In addition, 11 clinical isolates
from periodontal sites were tested for presence of
PG0185, PG0186, and PG0982.

To determine the potential role in invasion of ORFs
identified using this approach, we used PG0186 and
PG0186 isogenic mutants (35) and also constructed a
mutant of ORF PG0982, a tetratricopeptide domain
protein. We followed a gene deletion procedure for ORF
PG0982 using the suicide vector pPR-UF1 as described
(37). Two fragments (A and B) located at the 5? and 3? end
of the ORF, respectively, were generated on W83 genomic
DNA template through PCR, with restriction sites incor-
porated into, to allow for cloning into the vector. The 5?

GCAAATCA (XhoI site) and reverse, 5?-CCCCGGTA

AGCTCTTTGAGTGCAGCGAG (XbaI site) (nt 2167-

The DNA fragments A and B, flanking PG0982, were
digested, cloned into the vector and their presence was
verified using restriction digests, following cloning pro-
cedures for P. gingivalis (37). After amplification of
upstream fragment A, the vector pPR-UF1 and fragment
A PCR product were double digested with XhoI/KpnI.
After digestion, the fragment was ligated into the vector,
E. coli DH5a cells were transformed, and the target
plasmid, pPR-UF1A, was isolated from transformants.
Following amplification of downstream fragment B,
pPR-UF1A and fragment B PCR product were double
digested with SphI/XbaI. Fragment B was then ligated
into the vector, transformed, and the resulting suicide
plasmid pPR-UF1AB was isolated as described above.
The plasmid pPR-UF1AB was linearized with PciI and
introduced into P. gingivalis W83 via electroporation.
The pulsed bacteria were plated on BAP containing 5 mg/
ml of erythromycin for selection of transformants carry-
ing the deletion of the ORF. To confirm the deletion,
DNA was isolated from two separate transformants and
amplified using three primer sets:
(1) Fragment A
forward primer and fragment B reverse primer (expected
product in wild type W83, 2,955 bp, and 3,100 bp in the
mutant); (2) Fragment A forward primer and internal
fragment reverse primer (expected product in wild type
W83, 2,018 bp, and none in mutant);
(3) Internal
fragment forward primer and fragment B reverse primer
(expected product in wild type W83, 1,172 bp, and none
in mutant).

line.
Differential recovery of P. gingivalis W83, AJW2, and
AJW4 is shown in Fig. 1. Among these three strains of P.
gingivalis, recovery from host cells was again the lowest
for strain AJW4 (Fig. 1A), confirming the difference in
strain invasion of this continuous endothelial cell line.
The previous observations for KB host cells were also
confirmed (Fig. 1B), providing confidence in our choice
of strains for this investigation.

Comparative genomic hybridization
Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridizations
were performed with the control, W83, and the tester,
low-invasive AJW4 strain. Each microarray slide con-
tains four identical sets of 70-mer oligonucleotides
representing all P. gingivalis ORFs. The results represent
the common findings of four independent array hybridi-
zations performed with W83 Cy3 and AJW4 Cy5 labeled
genomic DNA (for a total of 16 repeats per ORF). In
addition, two independent analyses of the images, using
SAOPMD and Ginkgo software packages were per-
formed to cross-validate the data. The generated files
were imported into Microsoft Excel for final processing.
The analysis demonstrated a degree of genetic poly-
morphism within the 70 bp amplicons on the microarray
that the AJW4 hybridization signal was significantly
reduced for a total of 120 ORFs, based on M-value
(log2 of signal ratio) grading with a cut-off of 0.7. Due to
the inherent limitation of the microarray technology
used, the results may represent genetic diversity within
the oligonucleotide 70-nt sequence leading to reduced
hybridization signal rather than absence of the entire
ORF, therefore genetic approach was used for ultimate
validation of results. Fifty-one of the identified ORFs are
annotated as hypothetical proteins, three are involved in
carbohydrate metabolism, 4 are putative lipoproteins, 3
are surface proteins, 11 are involved with DNA mobility

(insertion sequences, transposons, transposases, or inte-
grases), 4 are conserved domain proteins, and the
remaining 43 have other suggested functions. All identi-
fied ORFs are listed in the supplement. A file with the
experimental data is available at the NCBI GEO site,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, GPL8955.

PCR validation
PCR testing of five ORFs not detected in the low-invasive
strain AJW4 according to the microarray data was
performed using gene-specific primers. The primers
were located outside the 70-mer microarray amplicons
in order to reduce effects of sequence divergence (http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). As additional positive
controls, DNA from invasive P. gingivalis strains 381 and
A7436 were used. We and others have previously
demonstrated that these strains are invasive for vascular
cell types (9, 38). The PCR verification demonstrated that
all five tested ORFs were absent from both non-invasive
strains while present in all tested invasive strains (Table 2
and Fig. 2). As an additional control, ORF PG1261,
selected with M-value below the cut-off threshold was
tested. ORF PG1261 was found in all tested P. gingivalis
strains, thus validating the threshold value.

Analysis of clinical isolates
We then analyzed 11 clinical strains isolated from
periodontal sites for the presence of suggested invasion-
associated ORFs. We used primers for ORFs PG0185,
PG0186, and PG0982, as they were already validated in
initial tests (Table 2). The PCR analysis of the clinical P.
gingivalis isolates demonstrated their presence in the
strains, with the exception of strain #6.

Discussion

P. gingivalis genetic heterogeneity (genome
polymorphisms)
Invasion of non-phagocytic cells is a key virulence
property of P. gingivalis. Although individual ORFs
have been tested for encoded proteins with invasion-
related properties and mutants with impaired invasion
have been used for studies (17, 39), surprisingly, no
systemic study of P. gingivalis invasion at genome level
has been communicated so far. Non-invasive P. gingivalis
strains may not be common, since in a study surveying
the invasive abilities of multiple strains, only one of the
tested 27 strains, AJW4, was distinctly less invasive with
AJW2 distant second (Fig. 1) (11). A non-invasive strain
may be able to survive without invasion determinants in
dental plaque, due to the hemorrhage (secured iron) and
biofilm (protection) secured by other strains in the
biofilm microenvironment, but such a strain wouldn’t
be able to survive intracellularly and disseminate to other
tissues. It is also possible that strains with lower invasive
ability than W83 may have a different mechanism of
virulence that would be revealed by CGH analysis. In this
study, we utilized a non-invading strain to identify the
ORFs that are missing in its genome, relative to the
invading database strain.

In the study of invasion efficiency of 27 different

fragments with the expected size (Fig. 3A). After electro-
poration of competent P. gingivalis W83 with the con-
struct, mutants were selected on erythromycin. Two of the
selected transformants were analyzed to confirm the
introduced deletion via PCRof genomic DNA as described
in Methods. The mutants, W83DTPRI#1 and W83D
TPRI#2, produced the predicted 3,100 bp amplification
product only with flanking primers, fragment A forward,
and fragment B reverse primer (Fig. 3B). No products were
obtained using primers internal for the PG0982 coding

We used antibiotic protection assay in three independent
experiments to assess the ability of the PG0185 (ragA),
PG0186 (ragB), and PG0982 (TPRI) mutants to invade.

bacteria using the endothelial cell line HMEC-1. The
non-invading strain AJW4 was confirmed as our best
choice for genomic analysis since its invasion efficiency
was up to four orders of magnitude lower than the
invasive control strain W83. As the AJW4 invasion in KB
(ATCC CCL-17) cell line was again the lowest, KB cells
were utilized for further experiments.

The P. gingivalis genomic heterogeneity has been
demonstrated using multiple methods including random
fingerprinting
amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
(40), multilocus
analysis
electrophoresis
(MLEE)
(41), serotyping (42), heteroduplex analysis
(43), and RFLP (44). In addition, our data on the
interstrain variability of HagA, a major surface adhesin
implicated in virulence, demonstrated that this gene falls
into three groups depending on the number of adhesin
repeats (45). Interestingly, in this study of 23 laboratory
and clinical P. gingivalis strains, the only strain found to
have the fewest repeats (two) was the non-invasive one,
AJW4, used in the present work.

Genomic differences among subspecies account for
many important pathogenicity traits. We hypothesize that
a subset of ORFs is involved in important pathogenic
trait such as invasion of non-phagocytic cells. As we
expected, the invasive phenotype seems to be associated
with multiple ORFs. This has been the case with well-
studied organisms such as Salmonella where the acquisi-
tion of the ‘pathogenicity island’ (SPI-1) region may
represent the defining genetic event in the separation of
the Salmonella and E. coli lineages. In a similar CGH
microarray study of virulent M. bovis versus the attenu-
ated Bacille Calmet-Gue´rin (BCG) vaccine strains, five
loci representing 38 ORFs were absent from some or all

BCG strains (46). Using CGH of P. gingivalis strains
W83 and 33277, multiple divergent features were reported
(31). In our study, significant strain-to-strain genetic
differences in the P. gingivalis genome were demonstrated
between strains with different invasion phenotypes. Using
CGH and two software analyses, a total of 120 ORFs
were designated as missing in the non-invading strain
AJW4. However, the findings may represent genetic
diversity within the 70-nt oligonucleotide probes immo-
bilized on the slides, leading to false negatives. Therefore,
several of these ORFs were validated using PCR from
different templates (invaders and low invaders), and the
presence of a control ORF that is below our cut-off value
was shown in the low invaders thus validating the
methodology (Table 2).

The number of polymorphic ORFs (5% of genome)
identified using CGH of
the strains with different
invasion phenotype is in line with other studies examining
genomic differences between strains. The PFGE analysis
of laboratory and clinical isolates has demonstrated that
the genome plasticity of P. gingivalis is not due to point
mutations and that 55 W83 genes were, on average,
missing in the tested isolates that did not differ pheno-
typically (47). In order to overcome a typical shortcoming
of microarray technology, confirmatory analysis of
selected genes including control ORF was performed.
The results were as predicted in our model and clearly
demonstrate the existence of genomic heterogeneity
between the isolates. The biological significance of all
the interstrain differences can be evaluated by an
extended analysis of each divergent gene. The signal
ratios in a microarray analysis may be influenced by gene
polymorphisms resulting from strain divergence and by
gene copy numbers, and this could be clarified in a

focused study of an ORF of interest. The strength of
CGH is in the identification of particular virulence
genotypes followed by investigation of candidate ORFs
using functional genomics methodologies to test the
hypothesis. Such investigation is discussed below.

transposons,

Eleven ORFs involved with genetic mobility (insertion
sequences,
transposases, and integrases)
were identified using CGH and with most clustered in
genomic island 7 (PG0827-PG0874) identified in the
Oralgen database using base composition analysis and
BLAST taxonomy data (www.oralgen.lanl.gov). Another
cluster of divergent genes encompass many of the P.
gingivalis ORFs 14361454, identified as genomic island
12 involved in mobilization functions according to the
same database, while divergent ORFs PG1108PG1113
consist predominantly of ‘hypotheticals’. Flexible self-
transmissible mobile genetic elements are shown to
disseminate different virulence functions (48). Fittingly,
the majority of the divergent ORFs have GC content
different than the chromosome average of 48%, such as
PG1439 with GC content of 32.5%, which is a
compositional feature associated with horizontal genetic
transfer and pathogenicity islands (49). Genes involved
with carbohydrate metabolism were also divergent be-
tween P. gingivalis W83 and the low-invasive strain. For
example, ORF PG0109 is from a cluster of cell envelope
genes (biosynthesis and degradation of surface polysac-
charides and lipopolysaccharides) identified as genomic
island 2 in the Oralgen database (ORF annotations are
from JCVI). Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism
have been associated with invasion in other organisms
such as uropathogenic E. coli
(50) and Legionella
pneumophila (51).

Surface and immunogenic proteins have been sug-
gested to interact with host cell components in a variety
of organisms including P. gingivalis. We have previously
shown that HagB, a P. gingivalis surface protein (52) is
involved in adherence to human primary endothelial
cells. Similarly, in the present work, two divergent genes,
PG0185 and PG0186, coding for the rag locus surface
protein RagA and lipoprotein RagB, were among the
ORFs identified as missing in the non-invasive strain
using this type of analysis. Further, several of
the
divergent genes (with hypothetical function) are among
those we identified in P. gingivalis using in vivo induced
antigen technology (IVIAT) (53, 54). This finding is
supportive of our hypothesis because IVIAT proteins are
virulence factors only expressed during disease. There-
fore, some of the identified divergent genes can be
considered as vaccine candidates. Importantly, none of
the divergent genes identified here were found to be up-
regulated 2.5 hours after endothelial cell invasion (33).
This is expected in a model where the expression of genes

necessary for host cell invasion is reduced upon comple-
tion of the process. Finally, a large part of the identified
divergent ORFs were coding for hypothetical proteins
that can be objects of interest especially when they share
extensive homology with proteins from other pathogens.
For example, ORF PG0848 shares extensive homology
with genes from Bacteroides, Clostridium, Mycobacter-
ium, Legionella, and other genera and PG1526, featuring
an ATP-binding domain,
is homologous to genes in
Bacteroides and Prevotella.

To extend our findings to the actual periodontal
pathology and to test the hypothesis that invasion is a
critical virulence property, we examined 11 clinical strains
of P. gingivalis and three isogenic mutants. According to
our hypothesis, divergent genes are essential for patho-
genicity; therefore, they may contribute to the pathology
and should be present in disease isolates. To test this, we
analyzed P. gingivalis isolates from periodontal sites from
patients for the presence of divergent genes PG0185,
PG0186 (the ragA and ragB genes), and also for PG0982.
It has been suggested that the rag genes code for putative
TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor (RagA) and
for immunodominant antigen (RagB). Both mutants were
significantly less virulent than wild-type strains in a
murine model of infection (55) and PG0186 mutant has
been reported to have decreased invasion of endothelial
cells (56). The PG0982 has GC content of 37%, placing it
in the category of lateral genetic flow-acquired genes,
features a TPR motif (tetratrico peptide repeat) that
functions in a wide variety of cellular processes, and
shares homology with Yersinia and Pseudomonas type 3
secretion system low calcium response chaperone LcrH/
SycD (TIGRFAM and PFAM databases). The analysis
demonstrates the presence of these three divergent genes
in 10 of the P. gingivalis clinical isolates.

We also tested isogenic mutants for their efficiency of
internalization using bacterial invasion assays. PG0185
and PG0186 had reduced invasion ability, 5.1103 fold
and 3.6103 fold, respectively, confirming previous
observation of
impaired invasion of ORF PG0186
(ragB) mutant (56). Interestingly, the available RT-PCR
data suggest that gene expression post-invasion may not
be indicative of the role of the protein in the invasion
process. For example, both PG0185 (ragA) and PG0186
(ragB) mutants had reduced invasion; however, PG0185
(ragA) did not have significant change in expression level
2.5 hours post-invasion, while the expression of PG0186
(ragB) at that time point was down-regulated (33). In
contrast, several Shigella dysenteriae type III secretion
system effectors of invasion were increased in abundance
after infection in vivo (57), as were P. gingivalis transcripts
of PepO (PG0159), ATPase (PG1642), and ABC trans-
porter (PG2206); the mutants of these P. gingivalis genes

showed impaired invasion (25), although not identified
using the microarrays. The non-invasive fimbriae-defi-
cient mutant (in PG2132), a target identified using CGH,
is non-invasive and lacks pro-atherogenic response in
primary aortic endothelial cells {Roth, 2007 #3204}.
Further, P. gingivalis htrA (PG0593) mutant showed
increased invasion of epithelial cells (24), while htrA
expression was not changed significantly 2.5 hours post-
invasion. These differences reflect the variety of roles a
protein may play in the sophisticated process of host cell
invasion, namely attachment,
intra-
cellular localization, and phagolysosomal escape, and
ultimately in intracellular persistence. In addition, the
impact of the host cell line is significant (25). Again, in
this first global study utilizing unique non-invasive
P. gingivalis strain, we aimed at characterizing the
interstrain genomic polymorphisms, with the realization
that different mechanisms may impact
the invasion
efficiency (58). Based on the decreased invasion efficiency
of the PG0185 mutant, we designated RagA an invasion-
related protein.

Conclusion
This work is an important advancement in the genetics of P.
gingivalis invasion. We used P. gingivalis microarrays with
comparative genomics to specifically address the P. gin-
givalis invasive genotype using invasive and the only
available non-invasive phenotype. The results indicate
that more than 100 genes are missing from the genome of
non-invading strain. This is the first communication
identifying invasion-specific genetic differences of P.
gingivalis, a pathogen associated with one of the most
prevalent infectious diseases, periodontitis, and possibly
with vascular inflammations. Next, the data demonstrates
that the true degree of P. gingivalis clonal diversity is
significant and is only now beginning to be understood.
Interstrain genomic polymorphisms, together with the
individual host response hold the key to clarifying the
disease initiation and progression in the individual patient.
Further, we detected putative invasion-associated genes in
9 of the tested 11 P. gingivalis disease isolates from patients.
Finally, based on functional assays with isogenic mutant,
we identified PG0185 as an invasion-related gene. Defining
the molecular basis of invasive P. gingivalis-host cell
interactions is an important step toward a more complete
characterization of P. gingivalis virulence mechanisms and
the identification of a subset of genes that can be used as
targets for the development of the next generation of
diagnostic tools and/or intervention strategies.
