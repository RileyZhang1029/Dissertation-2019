Methane (CH4) ﬂux from ecosystems is driven by C1-cycling microorganisms – the
methanogens and the methylotrophs. Little is understood about what regulates these
communities, complicating predictions about how global change drivers such as nitrogen
enrichment will affect methane cycling. Using a nitrogen addition gradient experiment in
three Southern California salt marshes, we show that sediment CH4 ﬂux increased lin-
early with increasing nitrogen addition (1.23 μg CH4 m−2 day−1 for each g N m−2 year−1
applied) after 7 months of fertilization. To test the reason behind this increased CH4 ﬂux,
we conducted a microcosm experiment altering both nitrogen and carbon availability under
aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Methanogenesis appeared to be both nitrogen and car-
bon (acetate) limited. N and C each increased methanogenesis by 18%, and together by
44%. In contrast, methanotrophy was stimulated by carbon (methane) addition (830%),
but was unchanged by nitrogen addition. Sequence analysis of the sediment methylotroph
community with the methanol dehydrogenase gene (mxaF) revealed three distinct clades
that fall outside of known lineages. However, in agreement with the microcosm results,
methylotroph abundance (assayed by qPCR) and composition (assayed by terminal restric-
tion fragment length polymorphism analysis) did not vary across the experimental nitrogen
gradient in the ﬁeld.Together, these results suggest that nitrogen enrichment to salt marsh
sediments increases methane ﬂux by stimulating the methanogen community.

INTRODUCTION
Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas that is over 20
times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The
primary biological source of methane is microbial (methanogens
in the domain Archaea), as is the primary biological sink (methan-
otrophs among the Bacteria and Archaea). Therefore, understand-
ing the controls on these microorganisms is important for predict-
ing methane ﬂux from ecosystems, especially in the face of global
change drivers such as nitrogen enrichment.

Recently, atmospheric methane has been rising non-linearly,
increasing steadily by ∼1% per year (Lelieveld et al., 1993), lev-
eling off between 1999 and 2007 (Rigby et al., 2008) and now
rising again (Heimann, 2011). One hypothesis for these dynamics
is changes in agricultural practices (including chemical fertilizers)
that impact microbial sources of methane (Kai et al., 2011). Thus,
understanding the controls of C1-cycling microorganisms may be
central to predicting future atmospheric methane dynamics.

A variety of microbial taxa are involved in methane ﬂux, and
C1-cycling in general. Methanogens are strictly anaerobic organ-
isms that can use a narrow range of C1 compounds and acetate
(e.g., organic acids, methanol, methylamines, and H2 with CO2)
for energy and assimilation, with methane as the ﬁnal byproduct
of this metabolism. In terrestrial systems, the C compounds that
methanogens use derive from plants (root exudates or detritus)

and the metabolic byproducts of heterotrophic microorganisms.
Methanotrophs, which utilize methane for energy and assimi-
lation, are a subset of the broader group of all C1-consumers
known as methylotrophs. The biological oxidation of methane
by methanotrophs (methanotrophy) occurs both aerobically and
anaerobically. Non-methanotrophic methylotrophs, utilizing C1
compounds other than methane, are also intimately involved in
the methane cycle. There is a close physical association between
aerobic methanotrophs and non-methanotrophic methylotrophs
in the environment (Moussard et al., 2009; Qiu et al., 2009),
where methylotrophs likely consume the key intermediate of
methane metabolism (methanol) that would otherwise inhibit
methanotrophy (Wilkinson et al., 1974; Neufeld et al., 2008).

Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment through atmospheric
deposition and terrestrial runoff (Galloway et al., 2004; Den-
tener et al., 2006) impacts the biodiversity and functioning of
a wide variety of ecosystems (Vitousek et al., 2002). In partic-
ular, runoff from storm water, agriculture, and industrial sources
increases N inputs in coastal ecosystems such as salt marshes (Con-
ley et al., 2009). This increased nutrient availability clearly alters
salt marsh functioning by altering plant growth and plant com-
munity composition (Fitch et al., 2009; Graham and Mendelssohn,
2010; Cardoni et al., 2011). However, much less is known about
how N enrichment will alter microbially mediated biogeochemical

cycles such as C1-cycling. Nitrogen inputs may alter C1-cycling
directly by affecting the abundance, composition or efﬁciency of
C1-cycling taxa (Bodelier and Laanbroek, 2004; Aronson and Hel-
liker, 2010). Alterations may also occur indirectly, through changes
in the plant community and C availability to sediment microor-
ganisms. Salt marsh plants are usually N limited (Caffrey et al.,
2007; Crain, 2007), therefore N typically stimulates aboveground
plant biomass and possibly, the amount and quality of carbon
exudates leaked into the sediments (Dakora and Phillips, 2002).

It is unclear whether methanogens might be N limited in nat-
ural ecosystems. However, most evidence suggests that nitrate
strongly suppresses methane production, whereas ammonium-
based fertilizers may sometimes have a minor suppressive effect
(Conrad, 2007). In salt marshes, N addition might also indi-
rectly increase methanogen abundance or metabolic efﬁciency
through increased root exudates by reducing competition for C
from sulfate-reducers. Indeed, methanogens in anaerobic marine
sediments are thought to be out-competed for labile carbon sub-
strates by sulfate-reducing bacteria (Oremland and Polcin, 1982)
and are therefore subject to chronic C limitation.

Methylotrophs (including methanotrophs) are probably not
N limited in salt marshes, as many can assimilate ammonium
and some can ﬁx nitrogen (Hanson and Hanson, 1996; Auman
et al., 2001; Bodelier and Laanbroek, 2004). However, high N lev-
els can permanently or reversibly inhibit methanotrophy (Shimel
and Gulledge, 1998). N addition might also shift the methan-
otroph community toward better competitors in N-replete condi-
tions (Type I methanotrophs) over those that prevail in N-limited
conditions (Type II methanotrophs; Graham et al., 1993). Methy-
lotrophs, many of which are facultative and can use non-C1
compounds, might also respond to increased C through plant
root exudates, perhaps altering cross-feeding interactions between
methanotrophs and other methylotrophs.

Apart from the unclear effects of N addition on methanotrophy
and methanogenesis, we lack quantitative predictions about the
relationship between N availability and net CH4 ﬂux. Experimen-
tal gradients with multiple treatment levels allow the estimation of
“response curves” to a range of N enrichment conditions. In this
way, one might also identify critical thresholds, beyond which an
ecosystem dramatically changes its functioning (Cottingham et al.,
2005). Such quantitative results can then be incorporated into
ecosystem models. However, the vast majority of ﬁeld experiments
investigating the effect of N addition on ecosystem functioning
have used single N doses, making it difﬁcult to extrapolate these
results to the wide range of N enrichment scenarios projected in
the future. Indeed, of 48 studies reviewed about the effect of N
addition on gas ﬂuxes (Liu and Greaver, 2009), only one had three
experimental levels of N addition. Another meta-analysis focused
speciﬁcally on methane ﬂux showed that methane ﬂux increases
linearly with the amount of N added in upland soils (Aronson and
Helliker, 2010); however, it remains unclear whether this cross-
ecosystem pattern holds within any one ecosystem, let alone salt
marshes.

To investigate the effect of nitrogen addition on C1-cycling
microorganisms and methane ﬂux in coastal salt marsh sedi-
ments, we conducted a nitrogen addition gradient experiment in
three Southern California salt marshes. This experiment allowed

us to ask quantitatively how methane ﬂux changes in response to
increased N addition in the ﬁeld. Using laboratory microcosms,
we then tested whether this response was likely due to changes in
methanotrophy and/or methanogenesis via increased nitrogen or
carbon availability. Finally, we tested whether N addition changed
the abundance and composition of the methylotrophs, a broad but
major player in C1-cycling.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STUDY SITE DESCRIPTION
We selected three southern California salt marshes for this study,
Morro Bay National Estuary (MBE), Carpinteria Salt Marsh
(CSM) Reserve, and Tijuana River Reserve Estuary (TRE). All
include intertidal estuarine wetlands with deep channel sub-tidal
habitat (natural and artiﬁcial channels) and receive intermittent
and chronic nitrogen inputs from urban and agricultural runoff.
We chose these marshes for their similarities of vegetation types,
Mediterranean-type coastal climate, protected status, and having
areas within the marsh with similar tidal ﬂooding regimes (i.e.,
plots ﬂood during a≥+1.6 m tide). We determined sediment
salinity (using a refractometer), pH (in a 1:1 mixture with distilled
water), and total carbon and nitrogen content (by dry combustion
with a Flash EA1112 Series NC Analyzer) from sediment cores
taken to a depth of 10 cm in the three sites (Table 1).

W) is the
northernmost marsh in our study located in Morro Bay, Califor-
nia (San Luis Obispo County). The 930 ha estuary is protected as
a U.S. National Estuary. MBE is at the terminus of a 19,424 ha
watershed that drains the Los Padres National Forest, agricultural
ﬁelds, ranches and parks. MBE is fed directly by the Los Osos and
Chorro Creeks. Much of the area directly surrounding the marsh
is protected parkland (California State Parks) with the cities of
Morro Bay and Los Osos adjacent.

Carpinteria Salt Marsh (34˚24

W) is located
in Carpinteria, California (Santa Barbara County) and is part of
the University of California Natural Reserve System. At ∼93 ha,
CSM is the smallest of our three study sites. CSM receives year-
round nutrient inputs and other pollutants directly from culverts
draining a large upstream nursery complex and the Carpinte-
ria Creek watershed (3884 ha) that drains open ﬁeld agriculture,
orchards, and receives runoff from densely populated urban areas.
W) is
the largest and southernmost study site located just north of the

Salt marsh C1-cycling

Mexico–United States border in Imperial Beach, California (San
Diego County). The Tijuana River Reserve is part of the National
Estuarine Research Reserve System. The 1024 ha estuary is at the
terminus of a 453,248 ha watershed that drains the Tijuana River
Valley, three quarters of which is located in Mexico. The Tijuana
River has been used as a wastewater conduit for several decades.
Though progress has been made to reduce the sewage that ﬂows
into the estuary with upstream treatment facilities, moderate rain
events will cause raw sewage to overﬂow into the estuary.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
In the three study sites, we established seven levels of N addi-
−1. We randomly
tion: 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 g N m
assigned treatments to 1 m2 plots spaced 2 m apart from each
other (N= 105 plots; 3 marshes× 7 treatment levels× 5 repli-
cates/treatment). Each fertilization treatment was replicated ﬁve
times. This gradient included the most common fertilization rates
−1;
used in N addition studies in wetlands (100–300 g N m
Boyer and Zedler, 1998; Boyer et al., 2001; Crain, 2007) as well
as fertilization rates used in studies to evaluate the effect of
−1) on ecosystem functioning
N deposition (10–100 g N m
(Bradford et al., 2008). In each marsh, we located the plots in
areas with vegetation dominated by Salicornia virginica (pickle-
weed) and in similar positions in the marsh (i.e., distance to main
channel, distance to the ocean, similar tidal ﬂooding regime).

We added nitrogen as slow-release granular urea to provide
a sustained enrichment over time (∼10 weeks) rather than in a
single pulse. Granular urea converts rapidly to ammonium upon
contact with water. We buried nine perforated 50-ml centrifuge
tubes (8 cuts, 4 cm long× 4 mm wide) per plot, leaving only the
caps exposed above the sediment. Tubes were placed evenly (33 cm
apart) for homogeneous fertilizer delivery within the plot. The
tubes remained in place during the experiment, and we replaced
nylon mesh fertilizer bags in these tubes every 10 weeks during the
course of the experiment. Urea-free tubes in unfertilized plots were
used as disturbance controls. We applied the ﬁrst fertilizer treat-
ment in July 2008. Here we report results from February 2009, after
7 months of fertilization. We sampled each site over the course of
2 days and all sites within 1 week.

FIELD GAS SAMPLING
We measured methane ﬂux using static gas chambers (16 cm high
with a surface area of 104 cm2) that were gently secured 2.5 cm
deep into the sediment of each plot at the time of sampling. We
clipped the plant biomass just above the sediment surface of this
space at the beginning of the experiment to limit our measure-
ments to microbial and root emissions and let the system stabilize
for 7 months before sampling. We sampled gases (5 ml) from the
capped headspace by syringe. Before withdrawing the sample, we
mixed the headspace gases ﬁrst by pumping the syringe several
times and injected it into an evacuated gas-tight vial. Each plot
was sampled at four time points after securing the chamber (0, 30,
60, and 90 min). We also intermittently collected positive control
(1000 ppm CO2) and atmospheric samples to test for leakages,
but none were detected. We analyzed CH4 concentrations with a
gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC2014, equipped with a Thermal
Conductivity Detector for measuring CO2 connected in series to a

Flame Ionization Detector to measure CH4, and ﬁtted with a 2-ml
sample loop, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We calculated
CH4 ﬂux rates for each plot as the slope of the linear regression of
gas concentration over time. The detection limit was 0.7 ppm CH4.
In a few cases, we eliminated outliers and estimated the production
rate without that time point.

NUTRIENT ADDITION MICROCOSM EXPERIMENTS
To assess potential N and C limitation for salt marsh methan-
otrophs and methanogens, we conducted two companion micro-
cosm experiments in the laboratory. Using a fully factorial repli-
cated design we added N, C, and both N and C to sediment cores
(5 cm deep, 1.5 cm diameter) collected aseptically from an area
adjacent to the established plots at Tijuana River Estuary in July
2009. To establish an aerobic environment for the methanotroph
experiment and inhibit the methanogens present, each core was
removed from the corer in the laboratory and homogenized thor-
oughly in the presence of air for 5 min (6 cores/treatment, N= 24
microcosms). We then placed the homogenized core in the micro-
cosm tube, added the treatments described above and sealed the
tube. To establish an anaerobic environment for the methanogen
experiment and inhibit the methanotrophs present, other cores
were kept intact in the sterile plastic corers to reduce their exposure
to oxygen (N= 24 microcosms).

To test for N limitation, we added an amount of ammo-
nium chloride solution equivalent to 7 days of fertilization in
−1 ﬁeld treatment in one dose at the begin-
the 160 g N m
ning of the experiment (41.4 mg ammonium chloride in a 2-ml
injection, or 383.2 mM). Ammonium chloride was used because it
dissolves rapidly in water, delivering the N (as ammonium) imme-
diately instead of the slow-release urea that was used in the ﬁeld
experiment. To test for C limitation, we added the C substrate in
two forms depending on the experiment. To the methanotroph
experiment, we added methane gas (10 ml of 10 ppm CH4 bal-
anced in air for an average starting concentration of 5.87 ppm
CH4 ± 0.45 ppm). In comparison, the control treatment had an
ambient CH4 concentration (1.7 ppm CH4; lab air veriﬁed by
gas chromatography). To the methanogen experiment, we added
sodium acetate as the carbon substrate (2 mg sodium acetate in a
2-ml injection, or 12.2 mM). Sodium acetate was chosen because
it is labile but does not encourage fermentation reactions. We
added it at approximately double the weight of microbial biomass
(Allison and Vitousek, 2005), which was estimated at 0.8 mg/g dry
sediment based on total C analysis of the sediments. The control
microcosms received a sterile sodium chloride solution to account
for the extra ions and water added by the treatments. After adding
the nutrients by syringe throughout the cores, we sealed the tubes,
and for the methanogen experiment, ﬂushed them with pure nitro-
gen gas. Finally, we incubated the sealed microcosms from both
experiments at 20˚C.

We collected gas samples (5 ml) from the headspace of the
microcosms at 18, 48, and 72 h incubation. We analyzed the ﬁrst
3 day’s samples; however, we report only the results from the ﬁrst
time point (0–18 h) due to the high accumulation of CO2 in the
microcosms, which could alter microbial functioning. We deter-
mined CH4 concentrations with gas chromatography and CH4
ﬂux as described above.

METHYLOTROPH DIVERSITY
To examine the background methylotroph diversity in each salt
marsh, we prepared clone libraries targeting the methanol dehy-
drogenase gene (mxaF). This gene occurs in all gram-negative
methylotrophs and is diagnostic for methylotrophy (McDonald
et al., 2008). Therefore mxaF should target aerobic obligate and
facultative methanotrophs as well as other methylotrophs. We
collected one sediment core (10 cm deep, 3 cm diameter core)
just outside the experiment plots at each marsh in Septem-
ber 2008. We extracted total genomic DNA using the FastD-
NA® Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA).
PCR conditions for the mxaF gene were: (25-μl reaction vol.)
initial denaturing 95˚C (5 min), anneal at 55.6˚C (30 s), exten-
sion at 72˚C (40 s), 30 cycles total with a ﬁnal extension step
of 72˚C (5 min) (PTC-100 Thermocycler, Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). [Final concentration: forward and reverse primers

on a 0.8% agarose gel, and this fragment was then excised, puri-
ﬁed (QIAquick Gel extraction kit, Qiagen,Valencia, CA, USA), and
cloned (Invitrogen PCR4Topo kit, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following
the manufacturer’s protocols. Finally, 48 clones per marsh were
sequenced (Beckman-Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA, USA). We
compared the sequences to the GenBank database using the nr
blastx algorithm. The sequences have been submitted to GenBank
under the accession numbers JQ254993–JQ255023.

(cid:3)

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
We screened the sequences recovered from the mxaF clone library
for three criteria: quality (≥80% HQ reads), length (≥300 bp),
and identity (most similar to a methylotrophic bacteria using
blastx). We aligned the remaining sequences (N= 99) in pro-
tein space using Geneious Pro 5.03 (Biomatters, Auckland, New
Zealand) and created a nucleotide sequence similarity matrix using
Dnadist in the Phylip package (version 3.68; Felsenstein, 2005).
We deﬁned operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as sequences
sharing 99% sequence similarity (using the nearest neighbor algo-
rithm) and classiﬁed them using the MOTHUR software (version
v1.16.0; Schloss et al., 2009). We constructed a neighbor-joining
tree (Geneious 5.0, Tamura–Nei distance model) using represen-
tative sequences (oturep function in MOTHUR) from this study
and cultured strains from other studies, including Methylophilus
methylotrophus as an outgroup.

QUANTITATIVE PCR
To quantify the abundance of methylotrophs in the experimen-
tal plots, we used the same primer pair described above. We
isolated DNA from sediment cores (10 cm deep, 3 cm diame-
ter) collected from each plot (N= 105) in February 2009. We
extracted total genomic DNA in the same manner described
above. We prepared a standard by cloning the PCR product of
a Methylobacterium extorquens isolate into a vector (see above)
and linearizing the DNA (SphI, New England BioLabs, Ipswich,
MA, USA). To reduce the effect of PCR inhibition, we deter-
mined the appropriate environmental template concentration by

performing qPCR on a dilution series (1:100, 1:250, 1:500, and
1:750) of three random samples from each marsh in triplicate.
For the remaining samples, qPCR was performed on a 1:750 dilu-
tion, the dilution at which the copy number stabilized for all three
marshes. Quantitative PCR was carried out in 25 μl total vol-
ume: 5 μl template (1:750), 12.5 μl iQ SybrGreen mix (Bio-Rad),
forward primer 0.4 μM, reverse primer 0.4 μM. The reactions
were run on an iCycler (Bio-Rad) with the following conditions:
initial denature at 95˚C for 15 min, denature at 95˚C for 45 s,
anneal at 59˚C for 20 s, extension at 72˚C for 30 s – repeated
45 cycles; with a ﬁnal extension at 72˚C for 10 min. Real time
data was collected at the annealing step. The ampliﬁcation was
followed by a melting curve to check for unspeciﬁc priming or
primer dimers starting with 50˚C for 150 cycles, increasing 0.3˚C
per cycle.

TERMINAL RESTRICTION FRAGMENT LENGTH POLYMORPHISM
ANALYSIS
We performed terminal restriction fragment length polymor-
phism analysis (T-RFLP) analysis on the same DNA isolated above
(cid:3)
in the qPCR assays. We targeted the mxaF gene with 5
6-FAM-
labeled primers (Moosvi et al., 2005) using the same endpoint
PCR conditions as above. We gel puriﬁed the PCR products as
before and standardized the DNA concentration (20 ng DNA/μl)
for restriction enzyme digestion (TaqI Fast Digest®, Fermentas,
Glen Burnie, MD, USA). Enzyme deactivation and product puriﬁ-
cation was carried out following the manufacturers’ protocols
(Qiaquick Nucleotide Removal Kit®, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
We stored the products at−20˚C until fragment analysis (Laragen,
Los Angeles, CA, USA).

Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis
peaks were identiﬁed using GeneMarker® 1.7 with AFLP settings.
To identify “true” peaks from background noise, we followed Abdo
et al. (2006) using data points with values larger than four SD.
If more than 25 peaks were detected in a sample, we manually
inspected peaks within two base pairs of each other to decide if
these were true peaks, then re-standardized the peak heights in
these corrected samples by total ﬂuorescence.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For the ﬁeld experiment, we used a generalized linear model
(GLM) to test the effects of N addition, marsh site, and their inter-
action (marsh × N ) on CH4 ﬂux rates, the initial CH4 concentra-
tion (T = 0 min), and mxaF gene copy number with marsh as a
categorical factor (MBE, CSM, and TRE) and N addition treatment
−1).
as a continuous factor (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320 g N m
(The mxaF gene copy number was log-transformed to improve
normality and we report untransformed values in Figure 3C.)
To provide a model for N addition effects on CH4 ﬂux rates, we
averaged observations for each marsh (n = 21, 3 marshes× 7 treat-
ments) because neither marsh identity (marsh), nor an interaction
between marsh and N treatment (marsh × N ), had a signiﬁcant
effect on CH4 ﬂux in the GLM analyses. We then used a lin-
ear regression to test whether the CH4 ﬂux differed at each plot
depending upon the CH4 concentration in the chamber head-
space at the initial time point (T = 0 min). These statistics were
performed in JMP 8 (SAS Corporation).

Salt marsh C1-cycling

To investigate mxaF gene composition among the plots, we ﬁrst
square root transformed the T-RFLP peak data (to downweight
very abundant peaks) and calculated the Bray–Curtis similar-
ity (Magurran, 1988) between the samples. We then used PER-
MANOVA (Primer 6; Anderson et al., 2008) to test whether N
treatment and/or marsh location affected mxaF composition, with
marsh as a random, categorical factor and N treatment as a con-
tinuous covariate. (Log-transforming the N treatment variable did
not change the results, so we report only the untransformed test.)
To visualize the PERMANOVA results, we performed principle
coordinates analysis (PCO) on the Bray–Curtis similarity matrix
in Primer 6.

For the microcosm experiments, we used two-way ANOVA to
test for the differences of the rates of CH4 production or oxida-
tion between our treatments (factors: C addition, N addition and
C × N addition) with JMP 8.

tial (T = 0 min) headspace concentration was below 1.56 ppmv

that value, we generally observed a negative net ﬂux. This cut-
off is similar to the current atmospheric CH4 concentration of
−3, source: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/
1.77 ppmv (i.e., 1.25 mg m

oa/climate/gases.html). Although the reason for this relationship
is unclear, it does not account for the observed effect of N addition
on CH4 ﬂux. Initial CH4 concentration varied signiﬁcantly by
marsh (GLM, F 2,103 = 21.459, P < 0.0001), but not by N treatment
(GLM, F 2,103 = 0.738, P = 0.392). Further, N treatment still had a
signiﬁcant effect on the residuals of the initial CH4 concentration
versus CH4 ﬂux regression (GLM, F 5,97 = 3.133, P = 0.0115).

NUTRIENT ADDITION MICROCOSMS
The microcosm experiments aimed to test whether the positive
relationship between CH4 ﬂux and N addition in the ﬁeld was, on
balance, due to stimulating methanogens or inhibiting methan-
otrophs. We found no evidence for N limitation or inhibition of
methanotrophy with the single dose of N that the microcosms

received (two-way ANOVA, F 3,18 = 1.3194, P = 0.2657). How-

over controls and N addition treatments but there were no

interactive effects of C × N addition (F 3,18 = 3.1134, P = 0.0946).

tion (F 3,18 = 0.1487, P = 0.7043, Figure 2B). Adding either C

or N increased methane production rates by 18% over controls.
Adding C and N together increased methane production by 44%,
indicating that salt marsh methanogens may be co-limited.

METHYLOTROPH COMMUNITY COMPOSITION
The clone libraries created from sediments outside the experiment
plots revealed mxaF sequence diversity that falls outside of known
lineages (Figure 3A). Phylogenetic analysis placed about a third
of the sequences most closely related (92% similar) to a novel
marine Methylococcus capable of growth on methane, ethane, or
propane (Redmond et al., 2010). The only other known culture
that was similar to these sequences is an mxaF mutant created from

a Hyphomicrobium strain (Fesefeldt et al., 1997). The remaining
clones clustered into two distinct clades that appear to fall outside
of known methylotroph lineages. None of our clones clustered
with known obligate methanotroph clades.

Nitrogen addition did not affect methylotroph composi-
tion as assayed with T-RFLP either directly (PERMANOVA

F 1,100 = 0.635, P = 0.867) or indirectly through a marsh-by-N
interaction (F 2,100 = 0.698, P = 0.868). Methylotroph composi-
tion varied signiﬁcantly among the three marshes (F 2,100 = 2.203,
P = 0.002), although marsh location was estimated to explain rel-
atively little (∼10%) of the variation in composition. The PCO
plots supported this result; marsh differences were apparent pri-
marily along PCO3, which explained only 6.7% of total variation
in community composition (Figure 3B).

Methylotroph abundance also did not respond to N addi-

tion (GLM, N addition: F 2,103 = 1.594, P = 0.209; marsh × N
addition: F 2,103 = 1.875, P = 0.159). Only in the MBE marsh,

was there was a trend of a linear increase in mxaF copies with
increasing N addition (Figure 3C). However, the marshes differed
signiﬁcantly in average methylotroph abundance (GLM, marsh:

F 2,103 = 10.962, P < 0.0001). CSM had nearly twice as many mxaF
gene copies as both MBE and TRE, which had similar abun-
dances (CSM: 341,401± 34,771 SEM; MBE: 195,489± 16,942;
TRE: 171,884± 15,378).

DISCUSSION
Temperate salt marshes generally emit low levels of methane,
but these values are also highly spatially and seasonally vari-
able (King and Wiebe, 1978; Bartlett et al., 1985; Magenheimer
et al., 1996; Cheng et al., 2010). Thus, the range and variability of
methane ﬂux values observed in this study (−0.045 to 0.377 mg
−1) are similar to those reported previously for other
CH4 m
salt marshes. Despite the high variability observed, however, our
ﬁeld experiment suggests that increased N availability increases
methane emissions in southern California salt marshes, as in other
ecosystems (Liu and Greaver, 2009).

Further, the effect of N addition in these salt marshes appears
to be quantitatively predictable. Methane ﬂux increased linearly
with N addition in all three marshes despite differences in their

macrosystem features (e.g., size, tidal ﬂow constriction, and the
−1,
nature of their watersheds). With each added g N m
−1 will be emit-
we predict an additional 1.23 μg CH4 m
ted from the temperate low salt marsh zone during this time of the
winter season (February). Further, the sediments switched from
negative net CH4 ﬂuxes to net positive CH4 ﬂuxes at around
−1. While these results should be conﬁrmed in
10 g N m
other seasons and other salt marshes, they agree with a recent
meta-analysis of upland soils; methane ﬂux was also positively and
linearly related to the amount of N added, although the vast major-
ity of these soils were still net consumers of methane (Aronson and
Helliker, 2010).

−2 year

What accounts for this increase in methane ﬂux with N addi-
tion? Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that N addition
stimulates methanogenesis rather than inhibiting methanotrophy.
In particular, the microcosm experiment provides evidence that N
addition directly stimulates short-term increases in methane pro-
duction under constrained conditions for aerobic methanotrophy
(low oxygen conditions). In contrast, nitrogen addition did not
affect methanotroph activity, either by changes in methane con-
sumption rate in the microcosms or by changes in methylotrophic
community composition or abundance in the ﬁeld. Numerous
studies across a variety of ecosystems suggests that N addition
stimulates methanotrophy until a threshold, beyond which higher
amounts inhibit it (Bodelier et al., 2000; Bodelier and Laanbroek,
2004; Aronson and Helliker, 2010). Thus, one interpretation is that
methanotrophs in salt marshes are not N limited and further, the
level of N addition in the microcosms were not inhibitory. Alterna-
tively, we cannot exclude the possibility that some methanogenesis
was occurring in the aerobic chambers, which if stimulated by
N addition, might have masked equivalent increases in methane
consumption.

Addition of a carbon substrate (sodium acetate) in the
microcosms also greatly increased methanogenesis. Most likely
this was due to direct stimulation of acetoclastic methanogens,
which use organic acids. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which

use H2 + CO2, might also have been indirectly stimulated

through the byproducts of heterotrophic taxa that can use
acetate.

Salt marsh C1-cycling

Thus, in the ﬁeld experiment, methanogenesis may have been
stimulated by N directly and/or indirectly through an increase in
plant biomass and therefore, C availability to sediment microor-
ganisms. Indeed, our ﬁeld experiment showed signiﬁcant (linear)
increases in aboveground plant biomass with increasing N addi-
tion (Vivanco et al., unpublished) similar to many past salt marsh
studies (Boyer and Zedler, 1998; Bertness et al., 2002; Crain, 2007).
Zhang and colleagues also found greater CH4 emissions in a
brackish Chinese marsh, where exogenous N deposition increased
biomass of an invasive plant (Spartina alterniﬂora) (Zhang et al.,
2010).

Both the microcosm and ﬁeld observations are in accordance
with the hypothesis that salt marsh methanotrophy is limited by
methane (carbon) availability. In the ﬁeld in particular, we mea-
sured more negative methane ﬂuxes for higher levels of initial
methane concentration (Figure 1B), where sediments switched
from positive net CH4 ﬂuxes to negative net CH4 ﬂuxes at around
1.56 ppmv CH4. Similarly, a study of eastern U.S. salt marshes
showed an inverse relationship between methane availability and
net negative methane ﬂuxes (Bartlett et al., 1985). This dynamic
association leads us to the following speculative hypothesis: that
increases in CH4 due to N stimulation of methanogenesis might
eventually be compensated for, if methanotrophy is not otherwise
limited.

Even our small sampling of methylotroph sequences revealed
a high degree of undescribed diversity. Similar genetic work in
estuaries using 16S rDNA, methane monooxygenase (MMO) and
mxaF probes has also found a wide variety of taxa that share≤90%
similarity with isolated methylotrophs (McDonald et al., 2005b;
Moosvi et al., 2005; Nercessian et al., 2005). From the phyloge-
netic analysis, it is difﬁcult to know whether these new clades are
gamma- or alpha-Proteobacteria, let alone what carbon substrates
they may be using and speciﬁcally, whether any are methan-
otrophs. From work in other marine systems, we might have
expected to ﬁnd Type II methanotrophs (alpha-Proteobacteria;
e.g., Valentine, 2011).

Further complicating the matter, new discoveries of microor-
ganisms with novel methyl metabolism are increasingly blurring
the lines between which methylotrophs can use methane and
whether this function is obligate or facultative (Dedysh et al., 2005;
Redmond et al., 2010). A number of methylotrophic species lack
the mxaF gene (Chistoserdova et al., 2009). Thus, in the future it
would be useful to combine several complementary approaches
such as targeting both the particulate and soluble MMO as well
as mxaF (or mdh2 and xoxF for taxa lacking mxaF; Kalyuzhnaya

et al., 2008) with stable isotope probes (McDonald et al., 2005a)
to disentangle the complex web of processes performed by the
methylotrophic community (Jensen et al., 2008).

Despite these uncertainties, the clone library sequences suggest
that our abundance (qPCR) and compositional (T-RFLP) assays
most likely targeted non-methanotrophic bacteria. Although the
composition of this group varied among marsh locations, it did
not appear to respond (in abundance or composition) to N addi-
tion, at least as could be detected with the methods applied. These
ﬁndings indicate that non-methanotrophic methylotrophs are not
N limited in salt marshes and suggest that particular T-RFLP taxa
do not specialize on different N availabilities nor respond indi-
rectly to the increase in plant biomass (at least after fertilization
for 7 months).

Although salt marshes are likely a minor source of global
methane emissions (Hanson and Hanson, 1996), this study
demonstrates again the central role of microbial communities in
regulating global methane emissions. However, the intricate rela-
tionships between C1-cycling microorganisms pose a challenge for
predicting how methane cycling will respond to environmental
changes. Despite these interactions, however, we observed a con-
sistent, linear response to N addition at all three sites, indicating
that the overall methane ﬂux response to N addition is predictable
within an ecosystem. More work is needed to conﬁrm these results
in other seasons and more salt marshes to investigate whether this
stimulation is due to changes in abundance and/or composition
of the methanogen community or their metabolic efﬁciency.
