Often, cellular functions are performed by complexes consisting of many different proteins.
The composition of these complexes may change according to the cellular environment, and one protein may be involved in several different processes.
The automatic discovery of functional complexes from protein interaction data is challenging.
While previous approaches use approximations to extract dense modules, our approach exactly solves the problem of dense module enumeration.
Furthermore, constraints from additional information sources such as gene expression and phenotype data can be integrated, so we can systematically mine for dense modules with interesting proﬁles.
Results: Given a weighted protein interaction network, our method discovers all protein sets that satisfy a user-deﬁned minimum density threshold.
We employ a reverse search strategy, which allows us to exploit the density criterion in an efﬁcient way.
Our experiments show that the novel approach is feasible and produces biologically meaningful results.
In comparative validation studies using yeast data, the method achieved the best overall prediction performance with respect to conﬁrmed complexes.
Moreover, by enhancing the yeast network with phenotypic and phylogenetic proﬁles and the human network with tissue-speciﬁc expression data, we identiﬁed condition-dependent complex variants.

1 INTRODUCTION Today, a large number of databases provide access to experimentally observed protein protein interactions (PPIs).
The analysis of the corresponding protein interaction networks can be useful for functional annotation of previously uncharacterized genes as well as for revealing additional functionality of known genes.
Often, function prediction involves an intermediate step where clusters of densely interacting proteins, called modules, are extracted from    To whom correspondence should be addressed.
the network  the dense subgraphs are likely to represent functional protein complexes (Sharan et al., 2007).
However, the experimental methods are not always reliable, which means that the interaction network may contain false positive edges.
Therefore, conﬁdence weights of interactions should be taken into account.
A natural criterion that combines these two aspects is the average pairwise interaction weight within a module [assuming a weight of zero for unobserved interactions (Ulitsky and Shamir, 2007)].
We call this the module density, in analogy to unweighted networks (Bader and Hogue, 2003).
We present a method to enumerate all modules that exceed a given density threshold.
It solves the problem efﬁciently via a simple and elegant reverse search algorithm, extending the unweighted network approach by Uno (2007).
Remarkably, the required computation time between two consecutive solutions is polynomial in the input size.
The contribution of our article consists in (i) the development of a dense module enumeration (DME) algorithm for weighted networks, including a ranking scheme and an efﬁcient strategy to identify locally maximal modules, (ii) its application to the protein interaction networks of yeast and human and (iii) the effective integration of constraints from additional data sources.
There is a large variety of related work on module discovery in networks.
The most common group are graph partitioning methods (Chen and Yuan, 2006  Newman, 2006  van Dongen, 2000).
They divide the network into a set of modules, so their approach is substantially different from DME, which provides an explicit density criterion for modules (Fig.
1A).
Another group of methods deﬁne explicit module criteria, but employ heuristic search techniques to ﬁnd the modules (Bader and Hogue, 2003  Everett et al., 2006).
This contrasts with complete enumeration algorithms, which form the third line of research: they give explicit criteria and return all modules that satisfy them.
For example, clique search has been frequently applied (Palla et al., 2005  Spirin and Mirny, 2003).
The enumeration of cliques can be considered as a special case of our approach, restricting it to unweighted graphs and a density threshold of one.
Further enumerative approaches use different module criteria assuming unweighted graphs (Haraguchi and Okubo, 2006  Zeng et al., 2006).

While partitioning methods return one clustering of the network, DME discovers all modules that satisfy a minimum density threshold.

Combination with proﬁle data.
Integration of PPI and external proﬁle data allows to focus on modules with consistent behavior of all member proteins in a subset of conditions.
(Gavin et al., 2002).
Module enumeration offers a meaningful way to detect such variations of complexes.
Our DME algorithm can easily incorporate constraints from additional information like gene expression, evolutionary conservation, subcellular localization or phenotypic proﬁles.
Thus, the search can be guided directly towards the modules of interest, for example, modules that show coherent behavior in a subset of conditions.
The external data sources can provide further evidence for functional relationships of proteins and yield insights about possible functional roles of complexes and subcomplexes in different cellular contexts.
In recent years, many module ﬁnding approaches which integrate PPI networks with other gene-related data have been published.
One strategy, often used in the context of partitioning methods, is to build a new network whose edge weights are determined by multiple data sources (Hanisch et al., 2002).
Tanay et al., 2004 also create one single network to analyze multiple genomic data at once  however, they use a bipartite network where each edge corresponds to one data type only.
In both cases, the different datasets have to be normalized appropriately before they can be integrated.
In contrast to that, other approaches keep the data sources separate and deﬁne individual constraints for each of them.
Consequently, arbitrarily many datasets can be jointly analyzed without the need to take care of appropriate scaling or normalization.
Within this class of approaches, there exist two main strategies to deal with proﬁle data like gene expression measurements.
In the ﬁrst case, the proﬁle information is transformed into a gene similarity network, where the strength of a link between two genes represents the global similarity of their proﬁles (Pei et al., 2005  Segal et al., 2003  Ulitsky and Shamir, 2007).
In the second case, the condition-speciﬁc information is kept to perform a context-dependent module analysis (Huang et al., 2007  Ideker et al., 2002  Yan et al., 2007).
Our approach follows along this line, searching for modules in the PPI network  934  that have consistent proﬁles with respect to a subset of conditions.
In contrast to the previous methods, our algorithm systematically identiﬁes all modules satisfying a density criterion and optional consistency constraints.
In this study, we evaluate our approach on the yeast interaction network in comparison with four other methods.
Also, we report yeast modules restricted by evolutionary conservation and phenotypic proﬁles.
Furthermore, we discuss our results obtained from human protein interactions in the context of gene expression data.
2 MODULE MINING APPROACH We address the problem of extracting functional modules from PPI data using an enumerative density-based mining approach.
Today, there exist various experimental techniques to determine PPIs.
To analyze these data, it is common practice to integrate all interactions into one network where each node represents a protein, and an edge between two nodes indicates an interaction (Sharan et al., 2007).
Then node sets with higher density in the interaction network are more likely to represent functional protein complexes.
We propose a method to exhaustively enumerate all modules which satisfy a minimum density threshold.
To avoid spurious modules, conﬁdence weights of interactions are taken into account.
In this section, we ﬁrst describe the basic algorithm and then show how to integrate additional constraints in this framework.
Finally, we explain our module ranking criterion.
2.1 Dense module enumeration Formally, let us consider the interaction network as undirected weighted graph with node set V. Let W =(wij)i,j V be the corresponding matrix representation, containing positive weight entries for the given interactions and zero entries otherwise (for missing edges).
In the following, we assume wij  1.
Although we use weight matrices with non-negative entries in this work, the approach is suitable for mixed-sign data as well.
A module is deﬁned as a set of nodes U  V and its induced subgraph.
The density of U (cid:1) refers to the average pairwise weight, given by i,j U,i j wij  U ( U  1)/2  (1) The largest possible density value is 1 [we deﬁne ρW (U):=1 for  U =1].
Now we deﬁne the problem of DME as follows.
ρW (U)=  .
Deﬁnition 1.
Given a graph with node set V and weight matrix W, and a density threshold θ  0, ﬁnd all modules U  V with ρW (U)  θ.
The key point of any enumeration algorithm is the deﬁnition of an appropriate structure of the search space which allows for efﬁcient traversal and pruning.
To enumerate sets of entities, a canonical approach is to start with the empty set and then iteratively form larger sets by adding one element at a time  if it is evident that no further solutions can be derived from a certain set, the process of extension is stopped, i.e.
unnecessary parts of the search space are pruned.
It turns out that conventional pruning strategies as used in itemset mining (Han and Kamber, 2006), for example, are not suitable for DME.
The reason is that supersets of a module can in general have arbitrarily higher or lower density than the module itself (see Supplementary Material).
However, it is possible to traverse the search space in a way that allows for straightforward pruning.
In fact, we deﬁne a tree-based parent  child relationship between modules such that along each path from the root to a leaf, the module size is increasing, whereas the module density is monotonically decreasing.
Technically, our algorithm adopts the reverse search paradigm (Avis and Fukuda, 1996): in each iteration, we generate all direct supersets of the current module and select those which are indeed its children.
Due to the monotonicity guarantee in our search tree, only children  [22:36 20/3/2009 Bioinformatics-btp080.tex]  Page: 934 933 940   that fulﬁll the density criterion have to be further processed.
To describe our approach in more detail, we need the deﬁnition of weighted degree.
Deﬁnition 2.
Let W be the given weight matrix.
For u  U  V, the weighted degree of u with respect to U is deﬁned as  degW (u,U)=  (cid:2) j U,j(cid:7)=u  wuj.
The following lemma yields the key for deﬁning the search tree.
Lemma 1.
Let v  U be a node with minimum weighted degree in U, i.e.
u  U: degW (u,U) degW (v,U).
Then, ρW (U\ v )  ρW (U).
The proof is given in the Supplementary Material.
Further, we introduce a function ord, which deﬁnes a strict total ordering on the nodes, i.e.
for each node pair u, v with u(cid:7)= v either ord(u)  ord(v) or ord(u)  ord(v) holds.
With this, we deﬁne the parent child relationship for modules.
Deﬁnition 3.
Let U be a module and v  V \U.
U of U if and only if  u  U one of the following conditions holds:   := U  v  is a child  1. degW (v,U 2. degW (v,U  )  degW (u,U )=degW (u,U  ) ) ord(v)  ord(u)            In other words, we obtain the unique parent of a module by removing the smallest among the nodes with minimum weighted degree.
From the lemma we know that each module has a smaller or equal density than its parent.
Based on this, the DME algorithm starts with the empty set and recursively generates children as long as the density threshold is not violated (Algorithm 1), yielding thereby the complete set of dense modules.
By the deﬁnition of the parent child relationship, we cannot directly derive the children of a module U.
Instead, we have to check for all possible extended modules with one additional node whether U is their parent or not (reverse search principle).
In terms of complexity, DME belongs to the class of polynomial-delay algorithms, which means that, independently of the size of the results, the computation time between two consecutive solutions is polynomial in the input size (see Supplementary Material).
By changing the density threshold, the user can regulate the size of the output.
Also note that the computation can easily be parallelized.
Finally, dense modules that are subsets of other solutions are not so informative  we call them non- maximal.
While these redundant results could be eliminated by checking for each new module all previous solutions, it is possible to identify locally maximal modules without requiring additional computation or storage, as shown in Algorithm 1.
A module U is locally maximal if and only if for all v  V \U, U  v  does not satisfy the minimum density threshold.
Although a module with this property could still be non-maximal, it happens rarely in practice.
Algorithm 1 DME for node set V, weight matrix W, and minimum density θ. U represents the current module.
DME is called with U= .
1: DME (V ,W ,θ,U):  2: 3: 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13:  locallyMaximal = true for each v  V \U do if ρW (U  v )  θ then locallyMaximal = false if U  v  is child of U then DME (V ,W ,θ,U  v ) end if  end if end for if locallyMaximal then  output U  end if  Condition-dependent dense module enumeration  Integration of additional constraints  2.2 The DME framework makes it easy to incorporate and systematically exploit constraints from additional data sources.
For illustration, consider the case where we have an additional dataset which provides proﬁles of proteins or genes across different conditions (Fig.
1B).
For simplicity, let us assume binary proﬁles, being 1 if the protein is positively associated with the corresponding condition, and 0 otherwise.
Then, dense modules where all member proteins share the same proﬁle across a certain number of conditions are of particular interest  we call these modules consistent.
The problem of DME with consistency constraints is formalized as follows.
Deﬁnition 4.
Given a graph with node set V and weight matrix W, a density threshold θ  0, a proﬁle matrix (mij)i V ,j C and non-negative integers n0 and n1, ﬁnd all modules U  V with ρW (U)  θ s.t.
there exist at least n0 conditions c  C with muc=0  u  U and there exist at least n1 c  C with muc=1  u  U.
Given such a consistency constraint, we can stop the module extension during the dense module mining as soon as the constraint is violated.
This is due to the fact that the number of consistent proﬁle conditions cannot increase while extending the module  more generally, this property is called anti-monotonicity (see Supplementary Material).
So we simply add to line 4 of the algorithm a further condition which checks for the consistency requirements.
These are then automatically taken into account in the check for local maximality.
The use of additional constraints can restrict the search space considerably, so it accelerates the computation and helps to focus on biologically interesting solutions.
The described framework can incorporate any kind of anti-monotonic constraints.
Furthermore, one can use arbitrarily many of those constraints at the same time.
Sometimes, one might be interested in incorporating non-anti-monotonic constraints.
While they cannot be directly exploited for pruning, they can be used to ﬁlter the obtained modules.
As an example, our software allows to specify a minimum weighted degree threshold t such that degW (u,U)   t for all nodes u of all modules U.
We set t=0 throughout the article.
2.3 Module ranking The exhaustiveness of our DME approach enables us to exactly determine the uncommonness of the discovered substructures with respect to the network at hand.
Let W =(wij)i,j V be the matrix representation of the given network  the total number of nodes is denoted by  V .
Let U be a module with  U  nodes and density ρW (U).
Then, the probability that a random selection of  U  nodes in the network produces a module with at least the same density as U is given by(cid:3)(cid:3) U  )  ρW (U) (cid:3)(cid:3)  (cid:12)  V : U  (cid:12)  .
(2)  (cid:5)  (cid:12) = U   ρW (U (cid:4)  V   U   The exact value of the numerator can be obtained as a side product of the DME algorithm.
In the case of additional constraints, it includes only modules that satisfy them.
The modules in the DME output are sorted by their probability values (in ascending order).
This ranking scheme captures the intuition that the rank of a module should increase with its size and density, but from a theoretical point of view it is more principled than the ranking criterion used by Bader and Hogue (2003), which is the product of size and density.
Furthermore, our probability calculation refers speciﬁcally to the network at hand, in contrast to measures derived from network models (Koyuturk et al., 2007).
3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 3.1 PPI data For our experiments with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), we combined protein interactions in PSI-MI format from DIP  935  [22:36 20/3/2009 Bioinformatics-btp080.tex]  Page: 935  933 940   E.Georgii et al.
(Xenarios et al., 2000) and MPact (Guldener et al., 2006), which includes data from IntAct (Hermjakob et al., 2004), MINT (Chatr-aryamontri et al., 2007) and BIND (Bader et al., 2003), and interactions from the core datasets of the TAP mass spectrometry experiments by Gavin et al.
(2006) and Krogan et al.
(2006).
For the human analysis, interactions were extracted from the IntAct, MINT, BIND, DIP and HPRD (Peri et al., 2004) databases.1 One main challenge in the analysis of protein interaction networks are false positive edges.
To deal with this, we determined edge weights that indicate the reliability of the corresponding experimental techniques, following the method by Jansen et al.
(2003) (see Supplementary Material for details).
The resulting interaction network for yeast consisted of 3559 nodes with 14 212 non-zero interactions having an average weight of 0.67.
The human network contained 9371 nodes and 32 048 non-zero interactions having an average weight of 0.47.
3.2 Comparative analysis First, we validated the performance of DME on the yeast interaction network in comparison with four other methods: clique detection (Clique, implementation from http://www.cﬁnder.org.
), the clique percolation method (CPM, implementation from http://www.cﬁnder.org.)
(Palla et al., 2005), a procedure for joining cliques of a certain size to larger clusters, CPMw (implementation from http://www.cﬁnder.org.)
(Farkas et al., 2007), an extension of CPM which includes an additional clique ﬁltering step, and Markov clustering (MCL, implementation from http://micans.org/mcl.)
(van Dongen, 2000), a popular graph clustering method simulating random walks.
As a reference set of conﬁrmed complexes, we used the manually curated protein complexes provided by MIPS (Guldener et al., 2005).
To properly assess methods which can produce overlapping modules, we chose performance measures that are based on protein pairs rather than modules  in that way, we avoid taking the same subset of nodes several times into account even if it occurs in more than one module.
Deﬁning the intersection of pairs from predicted modules and pairs from known complexes as correctly predicted pairs, we calculated precision and recall as follows.
Precision= No of correctly predicted protein pairs No of protein pairs in predicted modules Recall= No of correctly predicted protein pairs No of protein pairs in known complexes  (3)  (4)  To obtain precision recall curves, we iteratively calculated the precision and recall values, each time extending the set of considered modules by the next highest-ranking module.
As the other methods do not provide a module ranking and our criterion is only applicable to enumerative approaches, we used the scoring scheme by Bader and Hogue (2003) mentioned in Section 2.3.
In fact, it produced for our DME results almost the same ranking as our criterion  the corresponding precision recall curves are virtually equivalent.
For each method, we tested a wide range of parameters (see Supplementary Material) and selected the conﬁguration with the largest area under the precision recall curve for Figure 2.
Clique and CPM cannot handle edge weights directly, but they preselect edges according to a minimum weight threshold.
1For all datasets we used the database versions available in May 2007.

The time measurements were performed on a 2.2 GHz processor.
Overall, DME shows the best prediction performance.
It has high precision with respect to the highest-ranking modules and then shows a sudden drop, which is due to a big module not annotated as a known complex.
Clique detects the same module, but there are some other higher ranked modules, so the drop happens later.
MCL and CPM stay always below DME.
Clique works quite well, however the precision drops quickly for higher recall values because edge weights are not taken into account.
It seems that DME has a clear advantage compared to CPM: by explicitly using the edge weights and tuning the density parameter, it allows for more ﬂexibility than the two-stage procedure of CPM, ﬁrst selecting edges and subsequently joining together cliques that satisfy an overlap criterion.
While CPMw allows to reﬁne the module search, it still differs signiﬁcantly from our approach.
As it joins preselected cliques, it does not control directly the density of the produced modules and might also miss some dense modules.
In our analysis, CPMw improved the result obtained by CPM, but is mostly inferior to Clique or DME.
Table 1 summarizes further statistics for the predicted modules.
As DME and Clique produced a large number of very similar modules, we computed for better comparability the number of  [22:36 20/3/2009 Bioinformatics-btp080.tex]  Page: 936  933 940   distinct modules.
For that purpose, we grouped matching modules into clusters  each cluster was represented by its top-ranking module.
To decide whether two modules match each other, we here computed the overlap score proposed by Bader and Hogue (2003), using a stringent cutoff of 0.5.
It is deﬁned as the fraction of overlapping proteins with respect to the size of the ﬁrst module multiplied by the fraction of overlapping proteins with respect to the size of the second module.
The same criterion was used to determine matches between predicted modules and known complexes.
While DME and Clique discovered a comparable number of distinct modules, the DME modules match many more known complexes.
Among these, we also ﬁnd small-sized complexes, so the overall average size of retrieved complexes is lower than that for Clique.
In addition, we report the number of complexes from which at least one protein pair was recovered as well as the area under the precision recall curve from the pairwise analysis (Fig.
2).
In both cases, DME is leading.
Furthermore, we investigated the enrichment of the distinct modules with respect to Gene Ontology (GO) terms.
For that purpose, we applied the TANGO tool (Shamir et al., 2005) using the default setting with P-value threshold 0.05 after correction for multiple testing.
Beside the total number of enriched modules, we also counted the number of enriched modules among the top 50 distinct modules, showing that for each method that produced more than 50 modules, most of the high-ranking modules satisfy the enrichment threshold.
For small modules the enrichment test fails even if they are totally pure.
Finally, we assessed the impact of detecting overlapping modules.
Concerning the number of proteins or protein pairs that appear in more than one module, there is large variation among the different methods.
DME and Clique produced the largest numbers of overlapping proteins and overlapping pairs.
Remarkably, the accuracy of overlapping DME interactions clearly increases with the number of modules in which they occur, whereas this is not true for Clique, as reﬂected by the difference of their AUC values (see also Fig.
4 in the Supplementary Material).
The overall precision of overlapping pairs is 45% for DME and 35% for Clique.
We also analyzed how many overlaps between known complexes were rediscovered by predicted modules.
Formally, we counted the cases of overlapping known complexes C1 and C2 where there existed overlapping modules M1 and M2 such that the following conditions were satisﬁed: (i) M1 M2 contains at least one element of C1 C2, (ii) M1\M2 contains at least one element of C1\C2 and (iii) M2\M1 contains at least one element of C2\C1.
Here, the number of  recovered overlaps was only slightly higher for DME.
3.3 Phenotype-associated yeast modules An additional feature of DME is the possibility to directly integrate constraints from external data sources.
In this section, we investigated our yeast interaction network in the context of knockout phenotypes in order to identify essential parts of protein complexes.
We took the growth phenotype proﬁles for knockout mutants in yeast under 21 experimental conditions (Dudley et al., 2005), considering three different phenotypic states: enhanced growth, normal growth, and growth defect.
We applied DME requiring for each module at least one condition consistently associated with growth defect for all members.
In order to get a set of modules covering a large number of proteins, but being at the same time as reliable as possible, we tested density thresholds between 0.95 and 0.80 using decrements of 0.01  Condition-dependent dense module enumeration  Table 2.

The results are summarized in Table 2.
Each of the 13 highest- ranking modules covers a considerable part of the mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit as annotated by MIPS.
In addition, our output list contained one further module that overlaps with the complex.
Figure 3A shows the superposition of these 14 modules.
Mrpl16 and Img2 appear in all, many other proteins in almost all of those modules, so they can be considered as the core of the complex.
Knockout of any of the shown proteins caused growth defects with glycerol as carbon source.
Some module members belong to other MIPS complexes, as depicted by the ellipses.
In particular, there is a strong connection to the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome and to the mitochondrial translation complex.
Furthermore, our results suggest that the mitochondrial ribosome is associated with Mhr1, a protein involved in homologous recombination of the mitochondrial genome (Ling et al., 2000).
Some modules that are not related to MIPS complexes nevertheless represent known complexes.
For instance, we exactly recovered the nucleoplasmic THO complex (Hpr1, Mft1, Rlr1, Thp2), which is known to affect transcription elongation and hyper-recombination (Chavez et al., 2000).
Interestingly, all mutants exhibit growth defects under the stress condition of adding ethanol in Figure 3B we show the highest-ranking module which covers at least 50% of two different MIPS complexes.
The corresponding proteins are associated with growth defects under addition of the aminoglycoside hygromycin B.
The module links the vacuolar assembly complex with the class C Vps complex.
The latter is a speciﬁc subgroup of proteins involved in vacuolar protein sorting.
Indeed, it has been shown that this complex associates with Vam6 and Vps41 to trigger nucleotide exchange of a rab GTPase regulating the fusion of vesicles to the vacuole (Wurmser et al., 2000).
to the medium.
Finally,  3.4 Evolutionary conserved yeast modules Next, we used the evolutionary conservation of proteins as side constraint for DME.
For that purpose, we extracted for all yeast genes orthologs from the InParanoid database (O Brien et al., 2005) with respect to 10 other representative eukaryotic species from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to Arabidopsis thaliana.
More precisely, we created a proﬁle indicating for each S.cerevisiae gene and each other model species whether there exist orthologs with a full inParanoid score in the other model species.
We searched for modules in the yeast interaction network such that all member proteins have orthologs in at least three other species  the density  937  [22:36 20/3/2009 Bioinformatics-btp080.tex]  Page: 937  933 940   E.Georgii et al.

threshold was determined using the same procedure as before (for a summary of the results, see Table 2).
(cid:12)  Figure 4 shows an overview of the larger MIPS complexes which were retrieved in our DME results, with or without the conservation constraint.
To deﬁne matches between complexes and predicted modules, we used the same criterion as in Section 3.2.
Apparently, we could identify some low-density complexes by discovering their dense core parts, for example the translation elongation factor complex eEF1 and the pre-mRNA 3 -end processing factor CFI.
In black, we indicate the percentage of the known complex that is covered by a conserved dense module.
From the total set of 33 recovered complexes shown in the ﬁgure, 19 overlap by at least 50% with such a module.
Among them, we ﬁnd the 20S proteasome and its cap and the translation initiation factor eIF2B complex.
The remaining complexes have rather small overlaps with conserved modules, even though they are quite accurately matched by their unconstrained counterparts.
Our conserved module predictions reveal putative core parts of complexes that are conserved across  several species.
As an example, we analyze the SNF1 complex, an essential element of the glucose response pathway consisting of six proteins.
Indeed, while the components Snf1, Snf4 and Sip2 are strongly conserved in all eukaryotes and are covered by a conserved module, Sip1 and the transcription factor Sip4 have no orthologs in other species, and the Gal83 component has orthologs in two species only (Vincent and Carlson, 1999).
Our approach predicted one additional conserved component of the complex, Sak1.
This is biologically meaningful, as it functions as an activating kinase of the SNF1 complex (Elbing et al., 2006).
The unconstrained module contained Sak1 and all SNF1 components except Sip4.
3.5 Tissue-speciﬁc modules in the human interaction  network  Finally, we were interested in tissue-speciﬁc modules of the human interaction network.
As side information, we downloaded the gene expression proﬁles by Su et al.
(2004), containing measurements in  938  [22:36 20/3/2009 Bioinformatics-btp080.tex]  Page: 938  933 940   Condition-dependent dense module enumeration  Fig.

79 different human tissues and present/absent/marginal calls.
For our purposes, we considered a gene to be expressed in a given tissue only if it was classiﬁed as present in both of the duplicated measurements.
In order to ﬁnd complexes which are present in several, but not all tissues, we applied DME to enumerate all modules that are consistently expressed in at least three tissues and consistently not expressed in at least 10 tissues.
We used again the same procedure for selecting the density parameter and ended up with 460 distinct modules (Table 2).
The two top-ranking modules cover the MCM complex (Fig.
5A).
As a reference, we used a manually curated set of human complexes collected by MIPS (Ruepp et al., 2008).
MCM is a hexameric protein complex required for the initiation and regulation of eukaryotic DNA replication.
The DME modules contain two additional proteins, Ssrp1 and Orc6l.
Orc6l is a member of the origin recognition complex (ORC), which plays a central role in replication initiation  in fact, the MCM and ORC complexes form the key components of the pre-replication complex (Lei and Tye, 2001).
This is nicely reﬂected by the high interaction density as well as the common expression proﬁles of the proteins: the module is fully expressed in three different types of bone marrow cells and fully non-expressed in 42 tissues like brain, liver and kidney, where cells are differentiated and divide less.
Ssrp1 is a member of the FACT complex, which is involved in chromatin reorganization (Orphanides et al., 1999).
Moreover, our analysis yields some insights about the tissue- speciﬁc reorganization of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which marks proteins for degradation.
Figure 5B depicts the ﬁve top-ranking modules that cover the complex (beyond those, there were three other modules covering only a single protein of the complex).
One of them contains as an additional component Cand1, a regulatory protein that inhibits the interaction of Cul1 with Skp1 (Zheng et al., 2002).
The four other peripheral proteins are F-box proteins, which serve as substrate recognition particles for the SCF complex.
Interestingly, the corresponding modules show different tissue speciﬁcities, indicating that the target proteins of SCF are selected in a tissue-dependent manner.
This ﬁnding is in accordance  with experimental studies (Cenciarelli et al., 1999  Kipreos and Pagano, 2000  Koepp et al., 2001).
On the one hand, it has been shown that in human cells multiple variants of the SCF complex exist, each one containing a different F-box protein for substrate recognition.
On the other hand, brain and blood cells have been identiﬁed as tissues of major expression for some F-box components, and expression variation of F-box components has been observed in several tissues like testis, prostate and placenta.
In our results, all detected module variants are present in natural killer (nk) cells, which play an important role in immune response (Janeway et al., 2005), whereas only a few are present in B-cells and testis  in certain brain regions, for instance medulla oblongata, only the module variant with Fbxw7 is predicted to be active.
As illustrated by this example, DME integrated with gene expression data can be a powerful tool to reveal functional and condition-speciﬁc variants of protein complexes.
4 CONCLUSION Our algorithm, DME, extracts all densely connected modules from a given weighted interaction network.
In addition to its completeness guarantee, a strength of the method lies in the possibility of transparent data integration, which is of crucial importance in biological applications.
Due to its generality, we believe that DME is a useful tool in many different systems biology approaches.
Our framework can also solve more general problems arising in the analysis of structured data, like dense subgraph detection in multi- partite graphs (cf.
Everett et al., 2006  Tanay et al., 2004) or in hypergraphs (cf.
Zhao and Zaki, 2005).
Moreover, module ﬁnding can assist in network comparison and classiﬁcation tasks (Chuang et al., 2007).
