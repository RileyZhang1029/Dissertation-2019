Abstract
Understanding how different kinds of neuron in the brain work together to implement sensations,
feelings, thoughts, and movements, and how deficits in specific kinds of neuron result in brain
diseases, has long been a priority in basic and clinical neuroscience. “Optogenetic” tools are
genetically encoded molecules that, when targeted to specific neurons in the brain, enable their
activity to be driven or silenced by light. These molecules are microbial opsins, seven-transmembrane
proteins adapted from organisms found throughout the world, which react to light by transporting
ions across the lipid membranes of cells in which they are genetically expressed. These tools are
enabling the causal assessment of the roles that different sets of neurons play within neural circuits,
and are accordingly being used to reveal how different sets of neurons contribute to the emergent
computational and behavioral
functions of the brain. These tools are also being explored as
components of prototype neural control prosthetics capable of correcting neural circuit
computations that have gone awry in brain disorders. This review gives an account of the birth of
optogenetics and discusses the technology and its applications.

“How can we invent new tools to understand
the brain?”
For a few years now, I’ve taught at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) a class called “Principles of
Neuroengineering,” which guides students through the
process of creating new neurotechnology innovations—
inventions that can solve outstanding scientific ques-
tions, or that address unmet clinical needs. This process
of neurotechnology invention is difficult, due to the
complex properties of
its inaccessibility,
heterogeneity, fragility, anatomical richness, and high
speed of operation. Thus, for a new neurotechnology
invention to work well with the brain, some serendipity
is required. Serendipity can be optimized to some
degree, however, if one is aware of the complex proper-
ties of
the entire process of
invention, from concept generation all the way to final
testing. This awareness, of course, does not insure that

the brain:

this path of
innovation will be fast or linear or
predictable, but it can support the dynamic process of
continually adjusting strategies and reducing risk along
the way.

Understanding this dynamic process of
innovation
might best be accomplished by close examination of
case studies, both successful and failed, from the past.
Some such case studies in the field of neuroscience have
been published, although they focus somewhat more on
the science side of things. For example, Andrew Hodgkin
wrote a detailed history of his now-classical studies on
neural excitability, which were empowered by adapting
to neuroscience many tools from the field of electronics
[1]. In the preface to his history, he wrote, describing the
dynamic path he took, “I think it necessary to give such
an account, because I believe that the record of published
papers conveys an impression of directness and planning

which does not at all coincide with the actual sequence
of events”. To illustrate such a path for a technology in
the modern era, I decided it might be useful to write
down the history of the development of the tool set
known as optogenetics—the set of genetically encoded
molecules that, when targeted to specific neurons in the
brain, enable their activity to be driven or silenced by
light. One great aid to the reconstruction of such case
studies in the modern era is the fact
that many
communications are self-documenting in a form that is
easily searched and shared (e.g., emails), and so
whenever possible I have tried to use these primary
documents to pinpoint when specific events transpired.
Of course, the choice to focus on a single trajectory of
work also inherently limits the scope of this essay. It is
not intended to be a comprehensive review of all the
work going on in this field in all labs, but is instead told
in a first person voice.

I was fortunate enough to get experience in learning how
to control complex systems during my undergraduate
days at MIT, where I studied physics and electrical
engineering. By the time I graduated, I had helped
develop methods for controlling 3D-animated robots
and mechanical systems, a prototype nuclear magnetic
resonance quantum computer, and an autonomous
underwater vehicle, amongst other complex systems. It
became clear that learning to control a complex system
was important for at least two fundamental reasons.
First, this process could help with understanding how the
system worked. Second, this process could be useful for
fixing the system by enabling its behavior to be steered.
I became quite interested in developing strategies for
understanding and engineering the brain. As I inter-
viewed for PhD programs in neuroscience in spring
1999, I asked the scientists I met on each stop the same
question: what tools should a physical sciences-trained
investigator develop, to help understand the brain?

within neural circuits, it would ideally be possible to
drive or quiet the activity of defined neurons embedded
within an intact neural network. By driving the activity of
a specific set of neurons,
it would be possible to
determine what behaviors, neural computations, or
pathologies those neurons were able to cause. And by
silencing the activity of a specific set of neurons, it would
be possible to determine what brain functions, or
pathologies, those neurons were necessary for.

A strategy: controlling the brain with light
When I started in the PhD program in neuroscience at
Stanford, I hadn’t
taken a biology course in years.
Fortunately, I had incredible freedom to play around,
engineering-style, with many different projects in those
early days, in part thanks to a fellowship from the Hertz
Foundation, and so I learned biology through collabora-
tive projects at the intersection of engineering and biology.
In late summer 1999, I set up my home base in Richard
Tsien’s lab at Stanford, and had time to read about many
different topics, ranging from technologies for printing
cells in patterns in vitro, to the physiology of synapses, to
new kinds of microscopy being developed. Also I was
fortunate enough to meet biologists willing to do
experiments together: printing substrates on multi-elec-
trode arrays to try to build up neural circuits in vitro with
Maitreya Dunham (then a student with David Botstein
and Patrick Brown), imaging stem cell differentiation into
neurons with Karl Deisseroth (then a Stanford MD-PhD
student doing research in the Tsien lab), and learning how
to work with rhesus macaques for behavior experiments in
Jennifer Raymond’s lab. Gong Chen, then a postdoctoral
researcher in the Tsien lab, taught me how to culture
neurons and to do patch clamp electrophysiology, and
gave me free rein to use his Nikon microscope electro-
physiology rig in the corner of the Tsien lab, which was
equipped with a high-speed switching light source capable
of delivering brief pulses of light, for calcium imaging.

One fact that emerged from those conversations was that
there are many different kinds of neuron in the brain,
which possess different morphologies, molecular com-
positions, and wiring patterns, and which undergo
different changes in disease states. New neuron types,
and new properties of existing neuron types, are being
discovered all the time. This diversity of neuron types
stands in contrast to, say, the circuit primitives that make
up a computer chip, which fall into a relatively small
number of classes, and whose computational properties
are understood because they are human-designed. In
order to determine how different kinds of neuron in the
brain work together to implement brain functions, and
to assess the roles that specific sets of neurons play

For my PhD work, I joined the two labs of Richard Tsien
and Jennifer Raymond in spring 2000, to work on the
question of how small neural circuits in the cerebellum
adapt to control movements as the circumstances of the
world change. In parallel, I started thinking about new
technologies for controlling the electrical activity of
specific neuron types embedded within intact brain
circuits. That spring, I discussed this problem during
brainstorming sessions, often late at night in the Tsien
lab, with Karl Deisseroth. Having trained as an engineer,
it was exciting for me to see his clinical perspective on
problems of the brain, and we talked extensively about
technologies then being explored for repairing neural
circuits,
from stem cells to transcranial magnetic

stimulation. We began to systematically think about
better ways to control specific neuron types in the brain.
Optical uncaging of neurotransmitters with ultraviolet
laser pulses was already a powerful method for
activating neurons, due to its high speed and spatial
precision [2-7], but it had not yet been adapted to a
neuron-type specific form [8,9]. We started to think
about delivering stretch-sensitive ion channels to
specific neurons, and then tethering magnetic beads
selectively to the channels, so that applying an appro-
priate magnetic field would result in the bead moving
and opening the ion channel, thus activating the target
neurons.
I did some preliminary calculations that
suggested it might be possible to do this. But, using it
would seem to require two different molecular reagents:
the gene for the stretch-activated channel, as well as
magnetic beads that would have to be infused into the
brain, perhaps repeatedly, to bind the channels. And, of
course, one would also need a magnetic pulse generator
capable of the high magnetic field gradients required to
move the tiny beads.

By late spring 2000, I had become fascinated by light-
driven ion pumps, naturally occurring seven-transmem-
brane proteins that contain within them the vitamin
A-derived chromophore all-trans-retinal as a light
capture molecule. These light-driven ion pumps
sounded particularly useful: when illuminated, these
proteins, known as opsins, rapidly translocate specific
ions across the membranes of the cells in which they are
expressed. Opsins had been studied since the 1970s
because of their fascinating biophysical properties—
these molecules undergo fast and rich conformational
changes during light-driven ion transport—and also
because of the ecological and organismal insights they
reveal into how different life forms use light as an
energy source or sensory cue. Bacteriorhodopsin, for
example, discovered in the early 1970s in the archaeon
Halobacterium salinarum [10,11], pumps protons out of
cells in response to green light (Figure 1A). In the late
1970s, the related molecule halorhodopsin, an orange
light-driven inward chloride pump (Figure 1B), was
discovered in the same organism, which lives in high
salinity environments where these two ion transport
rhodopsins contribute to the bioenergetics of
the
organism by pumping protons out of, and chloride
into, cells in response to light [12-16]. In the early
1980s,
the first microbial sensory rhodopsin was
discovered: a phototaxis receptor also in the same
organism [17,18]. Since then, both rhodopsin ion
transporters and sensory rhodopsins have been found
to be widespread in a diversity of archaea, bacteria,
fungi, and algae, where they serve photosynthetic and
signaling purposes.

If one were able to find a bacteriorhodopsin or
halorhodopsin that worked in neurons,
it could be
used to pump charged ions across neural membranes in
response to light, therefore shutting down the neurons’
electrical activity. For this strategy to work, an opsin
would have to express, and function, in the neuronal
lipid and ionic environment. One reason for optimism
was that bacteriorhodopsin had successfully been
expressed in eukaryotic cells such as yeast and frog
oocytes, and pumped ions in response to light in these
heterologous expression systems [19-21]. And in 1999, a
paper had come out which showed that, although many
halorhodopsins might work best in the high salinity
environments in which their host archaea naturally live
(i.e., very high chloride concentrations), one halorho-
dopsin, the halorhodopsin from Natronomonas pharaonis
(Halo/NpHR), functioned best, for whatever evolution-
ary reason, at chloride levels comparable to those in the
mammalian brain [22]. I was intrigued by this, and in
May 2000 I emailed the opsin pioneer Janos Lanyi,
asking for the clone for the N. pharaonis halorhodopsin
for the purpose of actively controlling neurons with light.
Janos kindly asked his collaborator Richard Needleman
to send it to me. But the reality of graduate school was
setting in: unfortunately I had already departed Stanford
for the summer to take a neuroscience class at the Marine
Biology Laboratory in Woods Hole. I emailed Richard to
ask him to send the clone to Karl. After I returned to
Stanford in the fall, I found myself quite busy with
learning all the skills I would need for my PhD thesis
work on motor control, ranging from how to do mouse
surgeries to how to run behavior experiments, and so the
opsin project took a backseat for a while.

The channelrhodopsin collaboration
In 2002, a pioneering paper from the lab of Gero
Miesenbock showed that genetic expression of a three-
gene Drosophila phototransduction cascade in neurons
resulted in neurons that could be driven by light [23], and
pointed out that the ability to activate specific neurons
with light could serve as a tool for finding neural
connections, and determining the power of specific
neurons to drive activity in neural circuits. The idea for
activating genetically targeted neurons with light was
clearly in the air. The light-driven currents mediated by this
system, however, took many seconds to switch on and off,
likely due to the multiprotein nature of the signaling
cascade, and this technical issue may have been a factor
that limited adoption of the tool. This paper was fresh in
my mind when, in fall 2003, Karl emailed me to express
interest in talking about the magnetic bead stimulation
idea again, as a potential project that we could do together
later—when he had his own lab, and when I was done
with my PhD and could join his lab as a postdoctoral

researcher—given our shared interests in controlling brain
computations. Karl was then a postdoctoral researcher in
Robert Malenka’s lab. I was then about halfway through
my PhD on motor learning in the labs of Jennifer
Raymond and Richard Tsien; I am very thankful for their
mentorship and for crafting an environment where people
felt free to tackle big problems.

Between October 2003 and February 2004, Karl and I
read through published papers where people had
perturbed cell physiology with magnetic beads, began
to figure out how to connect the beads to channels, and

did new rounds of calculations on the magnetic beads. I
also read a just-published paper by Georg Nagel, Ernst
Bamberg, Peter Hegemann, and colleagues announcing
the discovery that the opsin that drives phototaxis in the
green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [24] was a light-
gated cation channel (Figure 1C) that, when illuminated,
lets positively charged ions (such as H+ and Na+) pass
into cells in which it is heterologously expressed [25].
Nagel et al. accordingly named this molecule channel-
rhodopsin-2, and demonstrated in that paper that it
could be used to depolarize cells such as oocytes or HEK
(Human Embyonic Kidney) cells in response to light,

commenting presciently that channelrhodopsin-2
“should become a useful tool to manipulate intracellular
Ca2+ concentration or membrane potential, especially in
mammalian cells.” Using a light-activated channel
would require, for in vivo use, an implanted optical
fiber to be inserted into the brain, which at first glance
might seem more invasive than a noninvasive magnetic
field. But upon reflection, even the magnetic bead idea
would be invasive: the magnetic beads would have to be
injected into the brain, perhaps repeatedly as the beads
were eliminated by the body. Furthermore, it seemed
that, given the technology development curves that were
bringing microscopy increasingly into systems neu-
roscience (e.g., the increasing popularity of two-photon
microscopy), a light-driven method might find rapid
adoption by the neuroscience community. In February
2004, I emailed Karl proposing that we contact Georg to
see if they had constructs they were willing to distribute.
Karl emailed Georg in March, obtaining the clone for
channelrhodopsin-2 from Georg on a collaborative
basis, and then put the gene into a neural expression
vector. Georg had made several
further important
advances by then: he had shown that channelrhodop-
sin-2 formed stable fusion proteins with fluorescent
proteins such as YFP (yellow fluorescent protein), useful
for monitoring channelrhodopsin-2 expression in het-
erologous systems, and had found a channelrhodopsin-2
mutant less prone to inactivation than the wild-type—
the H134R mutant—which he sent to us as well. Also,
Georg commented that
little or no all-trans-retinal
needed to be supplemented to channelrhodopsin-2-
expressing cells being recorded in vitro—perhaps the
chemical chromophore of channelrhodopsin-2, all-trans-
retinal, was already present in cells or cell culture media
at levels high enough to support opsin function.

Finally, we were getting the ball rolling on neuron-type
targetable neural control. Karl and I brainstormed about
all sorts of things we could do: two-photon activation of
different neurons, obtaining neuron type-specific pro-
moters with which to target channelrhodopsin-2 expres-
sion to different cells, mutating channelrhodopsin-2 to
make multiple color variants, and so forth. Of course,
going after a tool based on a natural molecule such as
channelrhodopsin-2 presented risks; many things could
go wrong. Channelrhodopsin-2 might not express well
in neurons, requiring further, potentially painstaking,
molecular optimization to become compatible with
the neuronal milieu. Or, channelrhodopsin-2 in neurons
might require its retinal chromophore cofactor to
be externally supplied, making channelrhodopsin-2-
utilizing experiments complicated and dependent on
chemical supplementation. Or, perhaps channelrhodop-
sin-2 would not be able to mediate currents of sufficient

magnitude to result in neural spikes or action potentials.
Or, since the paper describing the discovery of channel-
rhodopsin-2 was already out, we might be racing other
labs to see if it worked in neurons.

Karl worked to optimize the transfection conditions to
get channelrhodopsin-2 expression in cultured hippo-
campal neurons, and found that indeed neurons could
tolerate channelrhodopsin-2 expression, and that the
expression was membrane localized. This was good
news: many past attempts to express natural opsins in
heterologous expression systems had not panned out,
perhaps because opsins that evolved in one lipid and
ionic milieu might not be optimal for another. I was
eager to look at the physiology of channelrhodopsin-2-
expressing neurons. Throughout July, working in the off-
hours when I was not working on my thesis projects,
I debugged the optical filters and learned to program the
fast-switching optics on the very same rig in the Tsien lab
on which Gong Chen had taught me to patch clamp,
years earlier. I owe Richard Tsien a debt of gratitude for
providing an environment in which new ideas could be
pursued, and I regret that we did not acknowledge in our
first paper on optogenetics that many of
the key
experiments had been done in his lab.

I

the core principles of

Late at night, around 1 a.m. on August 4, 2004, I went
into the Tsien lab, put a dish of cultured neurons
expressing channelrhodopsin-2-YFP into the micro-
scope, patch clamped a glowing neuron, and triggered
the program that I had written to pulse blue light at the
neurons. To my amazement, the very first neuron I
patched (Figure 2) fired precise action potentials in
response to blue light. That night I collected data that
demonstrated all
the Nature
Neuroscience paper that we published in 2005, announ-
cing that channelrhodopsin-2 could be used to depolar-
ize neurons [26]. In that first night of experimentation in
2004,
found that channelrhodopsin-2 was safely
expressed, and physiologically functional, when
expressed in neurons. Despite the small single channel
conductance of channelrhodopsin-2, the protein was
well-tolerated enough by neurons to be expressed at high
enough levels to mediate strong neural depolarizations.
Indeed, even with brief pulses of blue light,
the
magnitude of expressed channelrhodopsin-2 photocur-
rents was large enough to mediate single action
potentials in neurons,
thus enabling detailed and
temporally precise driving of precision spike trains
(Figure 1F). Activating a neuron expressing channelrho-
dopsin-2 repeatedly with light, over periods of half an
hour or so, did not seem to cause rundown of
channelrhodopsin-2 performance, or impair the neu-
ron’s physiology, which boded well for its utility in a

diversity of neuroscience experiments. And, by using
pulse trains of blue light, channelrhodopsin-2 could
mediate action potentials at tens of Hz, although the
channel kinetics prevented significantly faster action
potential trains from being driven. Finally, channelrho-
dopsin-2 inactivated upon extended illumination,
but recovered spontaneously, at a rate fast enough to
support useful neuroscience experiments. Serendipity
had struck—the molecule was good enough in its wild-
type form to be used in neurons right away.

After a long night of characterizing the functions of
channelrhodopsin-2 in neurons, I emailed Karl, “Tired,
but excited.” He emailed back, “This is great!!!!!”.

Transitions and optical neural silencers
In January 2005, Karl
transitioned from being a
postdoctoral researcher to being an assistant professor
at Stanford. Feng Zhang, then a first year graduate student
in chemistry (and now an assistant professor at MIT and
at the Broad Institute), had joined Karl’s lab, where he
cloned channelrhodopsin-2 into a lentiviral vector, and
produced lentivirus that greatly increased the robustness
of channelrhodopsin-2 expression over that mediated by
the transfection methods that Karl and I had used when
we launched the project. At the time, I was still a PhD
student with Richard Tsien and Jennifer Raymond, and I
continued to perform channelrhodopsin-2 experiments

in the Tsien lab (indeed, about half the channelrhodop-
sin-2 experiments in our 2005 Nature Neuroscience paper
[26] were done in the Tsien lab;
I started doing
experiments in Karl’s lab in late March 2005). We
confirmed that background levels of all-trans-retinal
were sufficient to support channelrhodopsin-2 function
in neurons, and we carried out experiments to flesh out
all the figures of our paper. Guoping Feng, then leading a
lab at Duke University (and now a professor at MIT),
began to make the first
transgenic mice expressing
channelrhodopsin-2 in neurons around that time as
well (published in [27,28]).

We submitted the paper describing the use of channel-
rhodopsin-2 to Science on April 19, 2005, where it was
rejected on the grounds that we hadn’t made any
scientific discoveries beyond finding that channelrho-
dopsin-2 functioned well in neurons. On May 5, we
resubmitted it to Nature, where it was then relayed to
Nature Neuroscience, and after one round of revision the
paper was accepted there, appearing online in August
2005 [26]. The term “optogenetics” was coined during
this period, and first used in [29] to refer to the use of
light to image genetically-expressed reporters of neural
function as well as to perturb genetically targeted
neurons (although some scientists now use the term
chiefly to refer to tools for neural manipulation).

Several other groups rapidly published papers demon-
strating the use of channelrhodopsin-2 in neurons in the
months following, including use in intact mammalian
brain circuits by the Yawo lab ([30], which appeared
online in November 2005), in the chick spinal cord by the
Herlitze and Landmesser labs ([31], which also appeared
online in November 2005), in the behaving worm by the
Nagel and Gottschalk labs ([32], which appeared online in
December 2005), and in the retina by the Pan lab ([33],
which appeared online in April 2006). The idea had most
definitely been in the air, with many groups chasing the
use of channelrhodopsin in neurons. These papers
showed, amongst many other pioneering results, that no
chemicals were needed to supplement channelrhodopsin-
2 function in the living mammalian brain, verifying in
vivo what we had found in cultured neurons before—that
no retinal cofactor needed to be externally supplied [26].
The Herlitze and Landmesser paper also remarkably
demonstrated the use of mammalian rhodopsin for
light-activated neural silencing, reporting that mammalian
rhodopsin could drive the opening of G-protein-coupled
potassium channels via the G-protein Gi [31].

I started getting positive feedback on channelrhodopsin-2
right away, and so almost immediately after I finished my
PhD thesis on motor learning in October 2005, two

months after the channelrhodopsin-2 paper came out,
I began the faculty job search process. At the same time,
I started a position as a postdoctoral researcher with Karl
and with Mark Schnitzer at Stanford. The job search
process ended up consuming much of my time, and being
on the road, I began doing bioengineering invention
consulting in order to help me learn about and explore
new technology areas that could be brought to bear on
neuroscience. I accepted a faculty job offer from the MIT
Media Lab in September 2006, and began the process of
setting up a neuroengineering research group there.

Around that time, I began a collaboration with Xue Han,
my then-girlfriend (and then a postdoctoral researcher in
the lab of Richard Tsien), to revisit the original idea of
using the N. pharaonis halorhodopsin to mediate optical
neural silencing. Xue was in the process of moving out to
Boston, where she eventually became a postdoctoral
researcher working between my group and Robert
Desimone’s group. Given that back in 2000, Karl and
I had planned to pursue this jointly, there was now the
potential for competition now that we were working
separately. Xue and I ordered the gene to be synthesized
in codon-optimized form by a DNA synthesis company,
and, using the same rig in Richard Tsien’s lab that had
supported the channelrhodopsin paper, Xue acquired
data for a paper showing that this halorhodopsin indeed
could silence neural activity (Figure 1E). We submitted
our paper to PLoS ONE, where it came out in March 2007
[34]. Meanwhile, Karl’s group, working in parallel, came
out with a paper in Nature a few weeks after ours,
showing independently that this halorhodopsin could
support
light-driven silencing of neurons, and also
including an impressive demonstration that it could be
used to manipulate behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans
[35]. Later, both of our groups teamed up to file a joint
patent on the use of this halorhodopsin to silence neural
activity. As a testament to the unanticipated side effects
of following innovation where it leads you, Xue and I got
married in 2009 (and she is now an assistant professor at
Boston University).

While halorhodopsin neural silencing was valuable as a
proof of concept, there were performance limitations,
including the low magnitude of the current, and also the
fact that halorhodopsins, when illuminated for periods
of tens of seconds, tended to get stuck in an inactivated
state, with a slow recovery period (taking tens of
minutes) [36-38]. I continued to order genes to be
synthesized that corresponded to different opsins or
putative opsins, continuing to survey genomic diversity
for better silencing opsins. The inexpensiveness of total
gene synthesis meant that it was possible to rapidly
obtain genes codon-optimized for eukaryotic or

together,

mammalian expression, and then to screen them for
new and interesting light-drivable neural
functions.
Brian Chow (who recently accepted an assistant profes-
sor position at the University of Pennsylvania), an expert
on genomics and synthetic biology, joined my lab at
MIT as a postdoctoral researcher, and began collaborat-
ing with Xue;
they found a new class of
neural silencer, the archaerhodopsin class (Figure 1A),
which was not only capable of high amplitude neural
silencing—the first that could support complete 100%
shutdown of neurons in the awake behaving animal
(Figure 1D)—but also was capable of rapid recovery after
having been illuminated for extended durations; we
published this finding in Nature in January 2010 [36].
The class of archaerhodopsins possesses several key
properties that make these opsins particularly high-
performance light-driven neural silencers, including fast
kinetics, which helps these opsins mediate high currents.
Interestingly, the archaerhodopsins are light-driven out-
ward proton pumps, similar to bacteriorhodopsin—they
hyperpolarize neurons by pumping protons out of the
cells. However, the resultant pH changes are as small as
those produced by channelrhodopsins (which have
proton conductances a million times greater than their
sodium conductances) [36,39], and are well within the
safe range of neuronal operation.
Intriguingly, we
discovered that the H. salinarum bacteriorhodopsin, the
first opsin characterized in the early 1970s, was able to
mediate decent optical neural silencing [36], suggesting
that perhaps opsins could have been applied to
neuroscience decades ago.

Applications: neuroscience and therapy
Usage of optogenetic tools has exploded, with new papers
arising frequently that use opsins to mediate either the
activation or silencing of specific neuron classes with light
in order to see how neurons contribute to behavior in
organisms including C. elegans, Drosophila, zebrafish,
mouse, rat, and nonhuman primate. Conventional
mercury and xenon lamps, light-emitting diodes, shutters,
scanning lasers, femtosecond lasers, and other common
microscopy equipment suffice for in vitro use. In vivo
mammalian use of
these reagents has been greatly
facilitated by the availability of inexpensive lasers with
optical fiber outputs; the free end of the optical fiber is
simply inserted into the brain of the live animal when
needed [40,41], or coupled at the time of experimentation
to a chronically-implanted optical fiber. In just the first
three years after the first paper on channelrhodopsin-2 in
neurons, these tools were used in vivo to determine how
specific kinds of neuron modulate brain functions such as
learning [42], wakening [43], somatosensation [44-46],
vision [47,48], breathing [49], and movement [40,50,51].
These tools were also used to activate defined neural

pathways, and to perform circuit mapping experiments, in
mammalian brain slices [28,52-56] and in vivo [27]. Since
then, topics ranging from Parkinson’s disease to fear to
cortical dynamics to pain have been explored using
optogenetics, as the tools become ever more widespread.

In 2009 my group published, in collaboration with the
labs of Robert Desimone and Ann Graybiel at MIT, the
first use of channelrhodopsin-2 in the nonhuman
primate brain, showing that it could safely and effectively
mediate neuron type-specific activation in the rhesus
macaque, without provoking neuron death or functional
immune reactions [57]. This paper opened up the
possibility of translation of optical neural stimulation
into the clinic as a potential
treatment modality,
although clearly much more work is required to under-
stand this potential application of optogenetics. Recently
we have found that Arch (archaerhodopsin-3 from
Halobacterium sodomense), and more light-sensitive var-
iants such as ArchT, also work well in the nonhuman
primate brain, mediating near-100% neural silencing of
cortical neurons in the awake primate in response to
light [58];
the ability to transiently silence specific
neurons with light might open up fundamentally new
kinds of clinical possibility in the treatment of disorders
where specific neurons are overexcitable.

For mammalian systems, viruses bearing genes encoding
for opsins have proven popular in experimental use, due
to their ease of creation and use; these viruses achieve
their specificity either by being taken up by specific
neurons and not others, or by containing regulatory
promoters that constrain opsin expression to specific
kinds of neuron [26,30,33]. One popular hybrid strategy
is to obtain one of the burgeoning number of mice that
express Cre recombinase in specific neuron types, and
then to inject a virus that contains a Cre-activated genetic
cassette encoding for the opsin, so that only in the Cre
recombinase-expressing neurons will
the opsin be
produced [55,59,60]. An increasing number of trans-
genic mice are also starting to emerge, in which an opsin
is expressed in a given neuron type through transgenic
methodologies [27,61,62].

My group at MIT has distributed these tools to
approximately 400 research groups worldwide, as of
early 2011, and Karl’s group has also distributed the tools
to many hundreds of labs as well. An essential aspect of
this work is the desire to distribute these tools freely and
openly, even pre-publication. Furthermore, to facilitate
the teaching of people in how to use these tools, our lab
regularly posts white papers on our web page [63] with
details on reagents and optical hardware (a complete
optogenetics setup costs as little as a few thousand dollars

for all required hardware and consumables), and we have
also partnered with nonprofit organizations such as
Addgene and the University of North Carolina Gene
Therapy Core to distribute DNA and viruses (the latter,
prompted by a suggestion from Karel Svoboda), respec-
tively. We regularly host visitors to see how we do
experiments, as the community building aspect has been
a central part of optogenetics from the beginning.

Beyond luck: systematic discovery and
engineering of optogenetic tools
The original optogenetic tools were identified in part
through serendipity, guided by a multidisciplinary
convergence, and a neuroscience-driven knowledge of
what might make a good tool. It is clear, looking back,
that enormous amounts of luck were involved in making
the rapid identification of
three classes of
optogenetic tool possible. As a strategy, the power of
inexpensive gene synthesis, coupled to rapid direct
electrophysiological assessment in heterologous expres-
sion systems, has proven valuable because it allows one
to rapidly screen through codon-optimized genes in a
mammalian neuronal context. Now this process of luck
optimization has become a science: new optogenetic
tools are emerging through systematic means;
for
example, the screening through genomes for new light-
activated proteins, and the systematic mutagenesis of
existing opsins, as principles of ecological discovery and
molecular engineering emerge. More powerful mole-
cules, more light-sensitive molecules, and molecules
with novel spectral characteristics, are opening up the
ability to do fundamentally new kinds of experiment,
as well as the ability to do more precise or powerful
experiments.

As just one example from my lab, Brian Chow and Xue
Han discovered that although the original halorhodop-
sin is sensitive to light in the yellow-to-red-range, the
opsin from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans, Mac, can
mediate neural silencing in response to blue light [36],
so that
two kinds of neurons, one expressing the
N. pharaonis halorhodopsin and one expressing Mac,
can be differentially silenced by red and blue light
respectively (Figure 3). However, there is still significant
crosstalk due to overlap in the activation spectra between
the pairs of opsins (i.e., Mac is slightly driven by red light
and halorhodopsin is slightly driven by blue light)
described above. Similarly, channelrhodopsins that are
red-shifted in activation spectrum relative to channel-
rhodopsin-2 have been identified [64,65].
Ideally
reagents could be devised that would be even further
spectrally separated than the existing tools. In addition,
opsins that are red- or infrared-light drivable would be
desirable, because such light can penetrate deeper into

Neurons expressing the Natronomonas pharaonis halorhodopsin (Halo) (top)
were selectively quieted by red light and not by blue light, whereas neurons
expressing the Leptosphaeria maculans opsin (Mac) were selectively quieted
by blue light and not by red light (bottom). Data were acquired from opsin-

the brain, enhancing the usefulness of the tools both in a
scientific sense and perhaps in a translational or clinical
sense. A lot of new capabilities are emerging at the
intersection of microbiology and plant biology, gene and
transcriptome sequencing, and bioengineering and
neuroscience; for example, we have entered into colla-
borations like the OneKP project, headed by Gane Wong
at the University of Alberta, to mine vast new genomic
resources for light-drivable molecules.

A second area of activity in the optogenetic tool
development space has been to alter existing opsins by
mutation, chimeragenesis, or other molecular alteration
strategies, to tune the performance of the opsin towards
different capabilities. For decades, scientists have
mutated targeted residues in opsins, and observed
changes in kinetics, spectra, and other properties
[36,66-73]. Recently, a number of groups have mutated
key amino acids within channelrhodopsin-2, creating
versions that stay open for long periods of time after a
brief pulse of light [74,75], or that close quickly after the
light pulse ends [39,76]. Other versions have been
created that do not inactivate as quickly [32,39,77], or
that are more light sensitive or higher amplitude when
expressed in neurons [78]. Furthermore, attempts have
been made to enable better expression of halorhodopsin
(which forms aggregates when expressed at high levels)
in neurons by adding sequences from potassium
channels to improve their trafficking [79-82]. The ability

to use high-throughput screening and directed evolution
to optimize opsins, which revolutionized the creation of
fluorescent proteins and many other bioengineering
tools, may greatly advance the ability to create opsins
with desired properties.

In some ways, the original serendipity, associated with
synthesizing a concept then rapidly giving it a try to
see what might work out in the context of the nervous
system, has now given way to the systematized luck of
bioengineering, with its machines and algorithms
designed to optimize the chances of finding some-
thing new. Perhaps, of course, even as this system-
atized luck accelerates, we will stumble upon new and
entirely unexpected innovations that work well amidst
the complexity of the brain—and perhaps that will be
the seed for a new bit of serendipity, beginning the
cycle again.
