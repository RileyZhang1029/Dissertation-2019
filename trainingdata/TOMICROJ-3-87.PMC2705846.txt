Abstract: Bdellovibrios are Gram-negative bacteria that are characterized by predatory behavior. Although Bdellovibrios 
exhibit  an  obligatory  parasitic  life  cycle,  it  is  possible  to  isolate  Bdellovibrio  variants  that  no  longer  require  host  cells  
for their growth. In this study, a new method for isolating Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus host-independent (HI) variants was 
developed. Filtered B. bacteriovorus prey cells were cultured with E. coli diaminopimelic acid (DAP) auxotrophs as host 
cells. Thereafter,  the lysate was plated on DAP minus media,  allowing only HI  colonies to develop. Using this method,  
we have isolated numerous HI variants and demonstrated that the emergence of HI variants may be occurring at a higher 
frequency than was previously suggested.  

Keywords: Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, host-independent, isolation.  

INTRODUCTION 

  Bdellovibrios  are  Gram-negative,  motile  and  uniflagel-
lated bacteria, which are characterized by predatory behavior 
or  an  obligatory  parasitic  life  cycle.  Bdellovibrios  attack 
other Gram-negative bacteria, penetrate into their periplasm, 
multiply  in  the  periplasmic  space,  and  finally  burst  the  cell 
envelope  to  start  the  cycle  anew  [1].  Bdellovibrios  are 
largely  found  in  wet,  aerobic  environments  and  were  first 
isolated  from  soil,  where  they  are  commonly  encountered 
[1]. 

  Although  Bdellovibrios  exhibit  an  obligatory  parasitic 
life  cycle,  it  is  possible  to  isolate  Bdellovibrio  variants  
that  no  longer  require  host  cells  for  growth  [2-5].  These  
host-independent (HI) or prey-independent variants complete 
the  transition  from  attack  phase  to  growth  phase  and  back 
again  on  standard  complex  bacteriological  media.  Further-
more,  these  variants  retain  their  ability  to  grow  on  prey  and 
are termed “facultative”. This “facultative” predatory charac-
teristic render HI variants more amenable to genetic manipu-
lation  than  the  host-dependent  WT,  thus  making  them  a  
valuable tool in the study of Bdellovibrio biology [5-7]. The 
major  difficulty  in  isolating  HI  variants  is  the  need  to  select 
against  the  remaining  host  cells.  To  this  end,  a  method  was 
developed  in  which  streptomycin  resistant  B.  bacteriovorus 
were  first  isolated,  followed  by  a  second  cultivation  step  on 
streptomycin  susceptible  host,  and  plating  the  lysate  on 
streptomycin-containing medium [8]. This method, although 
reliable,  required  a  relatively  long  incubation  periods  as  
well  as  manipulation  of  the  predator  in  order  to  produce 
streptomycin  resistant  Bdellovibrio.  Recently  an  isolation 
protocol  was  described  in  which  HI  variants  are  isolated 
from  the  lysate  by  filtration  and  growth  on  membranes, 
which are placed on rich media [9].

  Here,  we  describe  a  rapid  new  method  for  isolating  HI  
B. bacteriovorus directly from standard lysates that does not 
require  filtration  or  initial  isolation  of  antibiotic  resistant 
Bdellovibrio cells.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Bacterial Strains, Media and Culture Conditions:  

B.  bacteriovorus  strain  109J  ATCC  43826,  Klebsiella  
pneumoniae  ATCC  13883,  E.  coli  strain  S17-1  and  E.  coli 
strain WM3064, a diaminopimelic acid auxotroph, derivative 
of strain (cid:1)2155 [10, 11] were used in this study. E. coli were 
grown routinely in LB media at 37˚C. Strain WM3064 media 
was supplemented with 0.3 mM diaminopimelic acid (DAP). 
HI  variants  were  grown  in  peptone-yeast  extract  (PYE) 
amended with 3 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM CaCl2  at 30˚C.  Cells 
were  enumerated  as  colony-forming  units  (CFU)  on  agar 
plates.  B.  bacteriovorus  was  maintained  as  plaques  in  
double-layered diluted nutrient broth (DNB) (a 1:50 dilution 
of  nutrient  broth  amended  with  3 mM  MgCl2  and  2  mM 
CaCl2  [pH  7.2])  agar  (0.6%  agar  in  the  top  layer). B.  bacte-
riovorus  was  counted  as  plaque  forming  units  (PFU)  using 
the  double-layered  agar  method,  previously  described  by 
Shilo  and  Bruff  [12].  Standard  B.  bacteriovorus  induced 
lysates were obtained by adding a plug of agar containing B. 
bacteriovorus  plaque  (about  1x106  PFU/ml) 
to  1x108 
CFU/ml  washed  E.  coli  host  cells  and  incubated  at  30˚C,  to 
reach  a  final  concentration  of  1x108  PFU/ml  predator.  To 
harvest B. bacteriovorus, the 18 hr lysate was passed through 
three  separate  0.45  (cid:1)m  pore-size  filters  to  remove  residual 
prey and cell debris.  

Predation Experiments:  

Predation on Planktonic Cells:  

  Wild-type B. bacteriovorus or HI variants were grown in 
a  standard  induced  lysate  obtained  by  adding  0.5  ml  of 
predator  (1x107  PFU/ml  of  filtered  wild-type  Bdellovibrio 
lysate or 1x107 CFU/ml HI variant) to 5 ml (1x108 CFU/ml) 
of washed  E.  coli host cells, incubated at 30˚C in DNB on a

rotary shaker. The reduction and efficiency of predation was 
evaluated  by  plating  the  remaining  host  cells  on  LB  agar 
plates. Each liquid lysate test was carried out three times in 
triplicates.  
Plaque Predation Assays:  
  The  ability  of  the  predator  to  form  a  lytic  halo,  on  a  
relatively  thin  lawn  of  surface  attached  prey  cells,  was  
determined  using  a  modification  of  the  double-layered 
plaque assay [5]. K. pneumoniae was grown for 18 hr in LB. 
One-hundred μl of 10 times concentrated washed cells were 
spread on DNB media solidified with 1.5% agar. HI variants 
were grown as described above, centrifuged and resuspended 
in DNB. Twenty microliters of the predator was spotted on a 
lawn of host bacteria. Lytic halo assay plates were incubated 
at 30˚C and examined for the formation of a zone of clearing 
where  the  predator  was  spotted.  K.  pneumoniae  host  cells 
were  used  in  this  assay  due  to  the  ability  of  the  predator  
to  form  rapid  (24  hr)  lytic  halos,  which  could  be  easily  
visualized.  Each  plaque  assay  was  performed  at  least  three 
times with filtered B. bacteriovorus wild-type lysate or DNB 
serving as positive and negative controls.  
RESULTS  
Predation of B. bacteriovorus on E. coli Auxotrophs:  
In this study we were interested in isolating Bdellovibrio
 
HI variants using an E. coli DAP auxotroph, which could be 
easily selected against simply by growth on medium devoid 
of  exogenous  DAP.  To  confirm  that  B.  bacteriovorus  has  
the  ability  to  prey  on  E.  coli  DAP  auxotrophs  with  similar 
efficiency  to  wild-type  E.  coli  host  cells,  predation  experi-
ments  were  conducted.  E.  coli  strain  S17-1  and  WM3064 
were grown for 18 hr in LB or  LB+DAP respectively. The  
E.  coli  host  cells  were  harvested  by  centrifugation  and  
cultivated with filtered B. bacteriovorus 109J in DNB-DAP 
free  media.  As  seen  in  Fig.  (1),  B.  bacteriovorus  had  
the ability to reduce CFU of both strains to the same extent. 
No  reduction  in  CFU  counts  were  observed  in  the  control 

samples,  verifying  that  the  E.  coli  auxotroph  can  survive 
without  DAP  for  extended  periods  of  time.  Furthermore,  
no evident difference in predation was seen when examining 
the  two  lysates  by  light  microscopy.  This  preliminary  
experiment  demonstrated  that  E.  coli  WM3064  could  be  
utilized as prey by B. bacteriovorus using standard methods. 
The  data  provided  here  is  in  agreement  with  a  previous 
study,  in  which  E.  coli  WM3064  was  used  as  a  host  for  
B. bacteriovorus [4].  
Isolating  B.  bacteriovorus  HI  variants  using  E.  coli
Auxotrophs:  
  E. coli strain WM3064 was grown for 18 hr in LB+DAP 
media. The E. coli host  cells were harvested by  centrifuga-
tion, washed, and cultivated with filtered host-free B. bacte-
riovorus  for  24  hr  in  DNB.  Thereafter,  100  μl  of  serial  di-
luted overnight lysate were spread on peptone-yeast  extract 
(PYE)  media  without  DAP,  and  incubated  at  30˚C  until  HI 
colonies  emerged.  This method was used 19 times. In each 
experiment, numerous (>20 in the fourth dilution) HI yellow 
colonies  developed.  The  HI  colonies  varied  in  size  and  
pigmentation,  which  is  characteristic  of  HI  isolates  [2].  
No E.  coli  colonies  developed  on  PYE-DAP  minus  plates. 
Plating a high concentration of DAP auxotroph cells directly 
on the PYE-DAP minus plates, also did not result in E. coli
colony growth, validating that the WM3064 strain is unable 
to grow on media lacking DAP.  
  To  confirm  that  the  isolated  colonies  are  HI  derivatives 
of Bdellovibrio,  35 random colonies  were streaked  succes-
sively on PYE plates. The selected HI colonies were evalu-
ated  by  PCR,  using  primers  3F  (5(cid:1)-TAGACAGATGGGA- 
TTACT-3(cid:1)) and 913R (5(cid:1)-GTGTGATGACGACTGTGA-3(cid:1)), 
that  amplify a  (cid:1)900 bp region of B. bacteriovorus hit locus 
[2]. PCR reactions had confirmed that the selected HI colo-
nies  were  derivatives  of  Bdellovibrio.  A  (cid:1)900  bp  fragment 
was obtained only in the samples containing DNA template 
from WT B. bacteriovorus 109J and the HI isolates, with no 
amplification  product  developing  when  E.  coli  WM3064

DNA  was  used  (Fig.  2A).  Examining  the  HI  cells  by  light 
microscopy  demonstrated  a  strong  degree  of  similarity  to 
other HI variants isolates elsewhere [2, 4, 5, 8, 9]. The cells 
were relatively uniform  in  thickness, with  cell length being 
variable  from  2-60  μm.  To  assess  the  facultative  predation 
behavior  of  the  selected  HI  variants,  the  HI  isolates  were 
evaluated for their ability to reduce host cells. When grown 
in  the  presence  of  planktonic  E.  coli  host  cells,  the  HI  
isolates were able to reduce host cells CFU by (cid:1)5 logs within 
48 hr of predation (from 1x108 to 1x103). Additionally, when 
spotted  on  a  lawn  of  host  cells,  all  of  the  HI  isolates  were 
able to prey and form a clear lytic halo (Fig. 2B). Thus, the 
genetic, phenotypic, and morphological features confirm that 
the isolated colonies are HI variants of Bdellovibrio.

(B.b  WT), HI  variant  (HI)  and  DNB  (Control)  were  spotted  on  
a  thick  lawn  of  Klebsiella  pneumoniae  host  cells.  48  hr  after  
inoculation  a  clear  lytic  halo  formed  at  the  point  of  inoculation 
where predation had occurred. Lytic halos appeared for all of the 35 
HI isolates examined. Scale bar, 0.8 cm.  
  To  evaluate  the  changes  occurring  in  cell  population, 
during predation, a seven-day-old standard B. bacteriovorus 
induced  lysates  was  passed  four  times  through  a  0.45  (cid:1)m
filter, to remove any residual prey cells. The sample contain-
ing only B. bacteriovorus cells (1.1x106 PFU/ml) was added 
to 2.8x108 CFU/ml of E. coli WM3064 host cells, in DNB-
DAP minus media, and cultured for 72 hr. The change in cell 
population was measured by plating 100 μl of the lysate on, 
LB+DAP plates (for host cell  enumeration); double-layered 
agar (for WT Bdellovibrio); and PYE agar (for HI variants). 
As seen  in Fig. (3A),  an increase of 7 logs in HI CFU was  

seen  during  the  first  24  hr  of  incubation,  followed  by  a  
decrease  in  HI  viability,  reaching  1.8x104  CFU/ml  after  72 
hr.  As  anticipated,  a  3-log  increase  in  Bdellovibrio  PFU’s 
and  a  5-log  reduction  in  host  cell  biomass  were  also  
measured.  By  dividing  the  CFU  count  of  the  HI  colonies 
(1.1x107  CFU/ml)  by  the  WT  Bdellovibrio  concentration, 
measured  after  24  hr  of  incubation  (4.1x108 PFU/ml),  we 
concluded that the frequency of alteration from WT to HI to 
be 2.68x10-2. In order to eliminate residual HI variants in the 
inoculum source for WT Bdellovibrio, a seven-day-old lysate 
was used in this experiment since a preliminary experiment 
confirmed  that  any  residual  HI  variants  that  might  have  
developed  in the initial lysate  could not survive after seven 
days  in  DNB.  In  this  experiment,  HI  variant  was  grown  in 
PYE, washed and resuspended in DNB. The viability of the 
HI  variant  dropped  from  5x108  CFU/ml  to  4x104  CFU/ml 
after 48 hr of incubation. No HI cells survived after 120 hr of 
incubation in DNB. This experiment was conducted with six 
different  HI  variants;  in  each  experiment  cell  viability  was 
lost  within  96  to  120  hr  of  incubation  (data  not  shown). 
These  experiments  also  confirmed  that  the  HI  variants  are 
not capable of clonal growth in DNB media.  
  To evaluate if the emergence of HI variants is influence 
by environmental conditions, three lysates were prepared as 
described above and incubated at 25˚C, 30˚C and 36˚C for 72 
hr. As seen in Fig. (3B), the appearance of HI variants was 
correlated to the growth of the host dependent WT Bdellovi-
brio, which was slightly inhibited at 25˚C. No evident differ-
ence  in  the  development  of  HI  variants  was  seen  in  the 
lysates that were incubated at 30˚C and 36˚C. The frequency 
of  alteration  (HI  CFU/WT  PFU)  from  WT  to  HI  was  also 
found  to  be  comparable  between  the  three  lysates  being; 
1.2x10-2,  2.5x10-2  and  2.7x10-2  for  25˚C,  30˚C,  and  36˚C
respectably.  
DISCUSSION 
In  this  study  we  have  used  E.  coli  DAP  auxotrophs  as 
 
prey cells in order to isolate Bdellovibrio HI variants. These 
host  cells  could  be  easily  selected  against  by  plating  the 
lysate  on  PYE  plates  lacking  DAP,  allowing  only  the  HI 
variants  to  grow.  Microscopic  evaluation  and  viable  cell 
enumeration revealed that B. bacteriovorus could prey on the 
DAP auxotroph WM3064 strain with similar efficiency as on 
WT  E.  coli  host  cells  (Fig.  1).  Using  E.  coli  DAP 
auxotrophs,  we  were  able  to  rapidly  isolate  numerous  HI 
variants.  PCR,  microscopy  and  predation  analysis  all  con-
firmed that the isolated colonies are derivatives of HI B. bac-
teriovorus (Fig. 2A and 2B).  
  To  assess  the  frequency  of  alteration  from  WT  to  HI 
variants within the lysate, the changes in host, WT Bdellovi-
brio and HI cell concentration was examined. It is interesting 
to note that the development of the HI variants in the system 
was  higher  than  what  was  previously  reported  [8,  12].  
To  assure  that  no  HI  cells  are  carried  over  from  the  initial 
lysate,  which  was  the  source  for  the  WT  Bdellovibrio,  we 
used  a  7  day-old  lysate.  No  HI  cells  were  present  in  this 
sample (Fig. 3A and 3B). HI variants have been reported to 
arise at a frequency of 10-6 to 10-7 [8, 12] .Our previous work 
using  Seidler  and  Starr  procedure  for  isolating  HI  variants, 
also give rise to these variants at the same rate [4, 5]. Tradi-
tional  methods  used  for  isolating  HI  variants  called  for

the removal of residual prey  cells either by filtration, or by 
several prolonged cultivation steps. These steps were aimed 
at  isolating  antibiotic  resistant  Bdellovibrio  mutants  as  
well  as  reducing  the  remaining  host  cells  population  to  a 
minimum  [8,  12].  It  could  be  assumed  that  the  prolonged 
incubation periods as well as the filtration procedures, could 
have resulted in the lower number of HI cells recovered from 
the lysate. Since our procedure does not require filtration or 
an  extensive  cultivation  period,  more  viable  HI  cells  could 
supposedly be isolated.  
In recent years Bdellovibrio HI variants have become an 
 
essential  tool  in  the  study  of  Bdellovibrio  biology  [5-7]. 

However,  the  factors  influencing  the  switch  from  host  
dependency  to  host  independency  are  far  from  being  
understood.  Since  this  method  allows  the  isolation  of  
HI  variants  directly  from  the  lysate  without  the  need  of  
extensive cultivation steps, filtration or total host  consump-
tion,  this  method  could  be  used  to  study  the  effects  of  
various treatments on the frequency of HI cell development. 
In  this  study  we  did  not  see  any  significant  changes  in  
the  occurrence  of  HI  variants  when  cultured  at  different  
temperatures. However, we believe that using this new isola-
tion  approach  in  experiments  such  as  these  will  aid  in  the 
study  of Bdellovibrio  biology  as  well  as  shed  new  light  on 
the factors contributing to HI development.
