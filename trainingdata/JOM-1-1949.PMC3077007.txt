There has been a paradigm shift towards an ecological and microbial community-based approach to
understanding oral diseases. This has significant implications for approaches to therapy and has raised the
possibility of developing novel strategies through manipulation of the resident oral microbiota and
modulation of host immune responses. The increased popularity of using probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotic
supplements to improve gastrointestinal health has prompted interest in the utility of this approach for oral
applications. Evidence now suggests that probiotics may function not only by direct inhibition of, or
enhanced competition with, pathogenic micro-organisms, but also by more subtle mechanisms including
modulation of the mucosal immune system. Similarly, prebiotics could promote the growth of beneficial
micro-organisms that comprise part of the resident microbiota. The evidence for the use of pro or prebiotics
for the prevention of caries or periodontal diseases is reviewed, and issues that could arise from their use, as
well as questions that still need to be answered, are raised. A complete understanding of the broad ecological
changes induced in the mouth by probiotics or prebiotics will be essential to assess their long-term
consequences for oral health and disease.

In recent years, there have been significant changes

with respect to the effectiveness of, and attitudes
towards, conventional antimicrobial therapy to com-
bat disease. With the threat of widespread antibiotic
resistance rendering many antibiotics useless against
important diseases, there is an increased necessity not
only to minimise antibiotic use and develop novel non-
antibiotic-based treatments, but also to raise the profile
of disease prevention. There is a public appetite for new
therapies that are perceived to be natural through, for
example, manipulation of the resident microbiota by the
ingestion of probiotic bacteria or prebiotics. These
changing attitudes are also relevant to the prevention of
dental diseases and there is an increased interest in the
use of strategies
involve conventional
antimicrobial agents for oral care (13).

that do not

There has been a paradigm shift away from treating
dental diseases by targeting specific oral pathogens
towards an ecological and microbial community-based
approach to understand conditions, such as caries and
periodontal diseases (4,5). These approaches recognise
the importance of maintaining the natural balance of the

resident oral microbiota and the need to carefully
modulate host immune responses to the microflora at a
site.

One approach that has gained interest over recent years
is the use of probiotic bacteria for oral applications. The
rationale for their use in oral health care stems from the
increase in evidence that supports their claims for benefit
for a range of diseases, especially in the gastrointestinal
tract (612). In this article, we will review the data on the
use of probiotics for oral care or disease prevention, and
discuss some of the issues that arise from their use, as well
as identify questions that still need to be answered.

Probiotics and prebiotics
There is a long tradition, particularly in parts of Europe
and Asia, of ingesting microbes or food products that
affect the intestinal microbiota in ways that are believed
to provide beneficial health effects, i.e. intake of probio-
tics and prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as viable micro-
organisms that confer health benefit when administered
in sufficient doses (6). The organisms that have been used
as probiotics are primarily certain species of lactobacilli

and bifidobacteria, and Saccharomyces spp., but some
streptococci, enterococci and commensal Escherichia coli
have also been claimed to have beneficial effects in certain
situations (1, 6, 13, 14). Prebiotics (e.g.
inulin-type
fructans, maltodextrin, fructooligosaccharides and galac-
tooligosaccharides) have been defined as non-digestible
oligosaccharides that affect the proliferation of resident
commensal bacteria that may then exert probiotic effects
(15). More recently, the definition has been refined to
include selectively fermented ingredients
that allow
specific changes in the composition and/or activity of
the resident microflora that confer benefits upon host
well-being and health (16). Studies of prebiotics have
mainly been focused on gastrointestinal microbiota and
health benefits; there has been little work in the oral
cavity.

Much of

the evidence for the health benefits of
probiotics and prebiotics has been anecdotal, but the
last decade has seen some developments in establishing
the scientific base for administration of such agents and
in understanding the mechanisms underlying their effects.
This is reflected in the proliferation of reviews in this area
in recent years (1, 614, 1721).

Current applications of probiotics and
prebiotics
Most of the applications and research into the mechan-
isms of action of probiotics and prebiotics concentrate on
their roles in influencing intestinal health and function.
Although some of the experimental evidence and data
from clinical
there is growing
evidence for their efficacy in protecting against acute
diarrhoeal disease in children, gastroenteritis and anti-
biotic-associated diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel diseases
and pouchitis (6, 7, 10, 12). There is also evidence to
support further investigation of the use of probiotics and
prebiotics in the treatment of illnesses affecting sites other
than the intestinal tract, e.g. urinary tract infections,
vaginal infections, arthritis, atopic eczema, pharyngitis
and otitis media (6, 7, 11, 22). Recently, Lactobacillus
rhamnosus GG (LGG) administered in yoghurt was
reported to enhance faecal clearance of vancomycin-
resistant enterococci (23). The possibilities of applying
probiotic therapy for other medical conditions are being
investigated,
including recovery from haemorrhagic
shock, recovery from burn injury, cholesterol reduction
and protection from coronary heart disease, effects on
breast cancer cells, enhancement of tolerance of food
allergens, protection from respiratory tract infections,
liver conditions, skin infections, enhancement of bone
health and reduction of obesity (18, 20, 21). However, the
evidence-base for many of these is relatively under-
developed.

The potential applications of probiotic bacteria have
been further expanded by the development of strains that

have been genetically engineered to produce the anti-
inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (24), trefoil factor family
proteins to enhance wound healing (25) or the 2D-CD4
receptor to try to reduce HIV infectivity (26).

Mechanisms of action

Probiotics
The diversity of conditions that may benefit
from
ingestion of probiotics illustrates the variety of mechan-
isms that may be involved in their actions and that some
effects are systemic rather than only local. It is likely that
these mechanisms vary according to the specific strain or
combinations of strains used, the presence of prebiotics
and the condition that is being treated, as well as the
stage of the disease process in which the probiotic is
administered (7). There are common themes emerging in
studies of
the modes of action of probiotics and
numerous mechanisms have been proposed (7, 911, 13)
including:

. Prevention of adhesion of pathogens to host tissues.
. Stimulation and modulation of the mucosal immune
system, e.g. by reducing production of pro-inflamma-
tory cytokines through actions on NFkB pathways,
increasing production of anti-inflammatory cytokines
such as IL-10 and host defence peptides such as
b-defensin 2, enhancing IgA defences and influencing
dendritic cell maturation.

. Modulation of

cell proliferation and apoptosis
through cell responses to, for example, microbially
produced short chain fatty acids.

. Improvement of intestinal barrier integrity and up-

regulation of mucin production.

. Killing or inhibition of growth of pathogens through
production of bacteriocins or other products, such as
acid or peroxide, which are antagonistic towards
pathogenic bacteria.

Prebiotics
The ability of certain oligosaccharides to enhance the
growth of resident commensal gut bacteria, particularly
bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, is well documented (17).
Thus, the major mechanism of action of prebiotics is
assumed to be indirect, i.e. facilitating the proliferation of
beneficial components of the resident microflora, with
probiotic effects resulting from the actions of
these
bacteria as described above. Cellobiose has the additional
property of down-regulating virulence factors of Listeria
monocytogenes (27). There is evidence that some pre-
biotics also exert direct effects on the host, independent
of their effects on resident bacterial populations (8, 15).
These include stimulation of expression of IL-10 and
interferon g, enhancement of IgA secretion, modulation
of inflammatory responses to pathogens and stabilisation

of the gut mucosal barrier. Additionally, prebiotics with
enhanced function have been designed. These oligosac-
charide derivatives contain sugars
that are specific
epithelial cell receptors to which pathogens adhere and
they, therefore, provide ‘decoy’ adhesion sites and cause
pathogens to adhere to luminal contents rather than to
epithelial cells (17).

The oral microbiota in health and disease
To be able to develop probiotic or prebiotic interventions
for applications in oral health care and to understand
their mechanisms of action and potential risks,
it is
essential
the oral
microbiota and their functions in oral health and disease.
This is not always easy, given the complexity of the oral
microbiota; more than 700 species have been detected in
the human mouth and the resident microbiota of one
individual may comprise 30 to 100 species (2830).

to have a clear understanding of

A wide variety of sites in the mouth are heavily
colonised. Supragingival and subgingival plaque form
through sequential and specific adhesive interactions that
result in a complex climax community (5, 31). The tongue
is heavily colonised and micro-organisms on the dorsum
of
the tongue are reservoirs for supragingival and
subgingival plaque and salivary microbial populations
(3234). Many oral bacteria, especially streptococci, also
survive within buccal epithelial cells (35, 36).

Functions of the resident microbiota
The main focus of research has been defining the micro-
organisms and their traits that are responsible for disease,
but there is an increased awareness that the resident
microbiota does not play merely a passive role, but
actively contributes to the maintenance of health. The
large, diverse resident microbial communities that colo-
nise mucosal sites co-exist with a host, with harmful
effects only if the host becomes immunocompromised, if
the resident microbial populations are suppressed or if
micro-organisms reach sites to which they do not
normally have access (e.g. through trauma). Studies,
mostly of gastrointestinal bacteria, have shown that
resident microbial populations contribute to host protec-
tion through blocking of colonisation by pathogens
(37, 38), development of cell structure and function
(39, 40), development of the immune system (41) and
modulation of inflammatory responses (4249). Evidence
is accumulating to support a similar role for oral
commensal bacteria in the development of the immune
system (50), the maintenance of healthy oral tissue by
influencing expression of mediators such intracellular
adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin and IL-8 (51),
modulating immune responses and enhancing cellular
homeostatic mechanisms (52, 53).

Prospects for the development of oral probiotics and prebiotics

Defining the resident microbiota
Technological improvements in the detection of cultur-
able and non-culturable micro-organisms has led to the
identification of increasing numbers of taxa in the mouth
(54, 55) and have confirmed that resident oral microbial
populations are site-specific as well as highly diverse, and
the profile of the microbial community may be specific to
an individual (28, 29, 33, 56). Species that predominate in
disease can often be present in low numbers at healthy
sites (5, 31).

In recent years there has been a greater emphasis, not
only on defining resident microbial populations more
fully, but also on identifying those that are significantly
positively associated with health in an effort to better
understand the processes that eventually lead to disease
and the ways in which microbial populations may be
manipulated to maintain hostmicrobe homeostasis and
to develop novel prevention strategies. Kilian et al. (57)
list the following species as ‘true’ oral commensal micro-
organisms: Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Ac-
tinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemo-
philus parainfluenzae, Eikenella corrodens and some
species of Prevotella. Other studies have generated an
increasingly long list of culturable and unculturable
bacteria with a significant association with healthy sites
(28, 30, 5860).

Microbial populations associated with oral disease
The most common oral diseases are caries and period-
ontitis, which result from a shift in the balance of the
resident microbiota at a site. The types and proportions
of bacteria found in plaque taken from sites diagnosed
with either caries or periodontal disease differ from one
another and both are distinct from those that predomi-
nate at healthy sites. In caries, there are increases in
acidogenic and acid-tolerating species such as mutans
streptococci and lactobacilli, although other bacteria
with similar properties can also be found and bifidobac-
teria, non-mutans streptococci, Actinomyces spp., Pro-
pionibacterium spp., Veillonella spp. and Atopobium spp.
have also been implicated as significant in the aetiology of
this disease (30, 6165).

In periodontal diseases, there is an increase in plaque
mass and a shift towards increases in obligately anaerobic
and proteolytic bacteria, many of which are Gram
negative and currently unculturable. The host damage
that occurs during periodontal disease arises through the
combined activities of subgingival biofilms and the host
responses
to these diverse bacterial populations.
A number of reviews give excellent overviews of period-
ontal microbiology (5, 54, 57, 6669) and these illustrate
the significant paradigm shift that has occurred, away
from concentrating on the roles of individual specific
pathogens to recognising that periodontal disease results
from the activities of successive consortia of organisms.

Other common oral

infections also result from the
activities of micro-organisms that are found in the
resident microbiota. Candida albicans and other Candida
species are present
in low levels in oral microbial
communities and can cause oral candidiasis and den-
ture-associated stomatitis (70, 71). Halitosis is most often
the result of production of malodorous metabolic end-
products (especially volatile sulphur compounds) by oral
bacteria, in particular Gram negative anaerobes (72, 73).

The potential for probiotics in prevention and
control of oral diseases

Probiotics in prevention of caries
The oral health applications of either probiotics or
‘replacement therapy’ with Streptococcus mutans strains
of attenuated virulence and increased competitiveness
were first suggested for prevention of dental caries more
than 20 years ago (74). Despite this, and the fact that
some products have reached the market, there remains a
paucity of clinical evidence to support the effectiveness of
probiotics to prevent or treat caries (2, 3).

Many early studies concentrated on utilising bacteria
that expressed bacteriocins or bacteriocin-like inhibitory
substances (BLIS) that specifically prevented the growth
of cariogenic bacteria (11, 74). Another approach has
been to identify food grade and probiotic bacteria that
may have potential in caries prevention. These have been
selected because of their likely ability to colonize teeth
and influence the supragingival plaque; in vitro models
for this selection have included adhesion to hydroxyapa-
tite, as a surrogate for colonisation of teeth, and mixed
species biofilm models (75, 76). Also, strains have been
screened for suitable antagonistic activity against relevant
oral bacteria (77). In vitro studies of the antibacterial
activity of live yoghurts showed inhibition of S. mutans
but not some other oral streptococci, including Strepto-
coccus sobrinus; this activity was heat-sensitive implying
that the effect was not simply due to acid (77). Recently,
oral lactobacilli have also been screened for their utility as
potential probiotic strains (7880) and strains of oral
lactobacilli have been isolated that are inhibitory against
S. mutans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Por-
phyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, as well
as being tolerant of relevant environmental stresses (81).
Another approach utilised a recombinant strain of
S. mutans expressing urease, which was shown to reduce
the cariogenicity of plaque in an animal model (82).
Similarly, genetically modified probiotics with enhanced
properties can be developed (‘designer probiotics’). For
example, a recombinant strain of Lactobacillus that
expressed antibodies targeting one of the major adhesins
of S. mutans (antigen I/II) was able to reduce both the
viable counts of S. mutans and the caries score in a rat
model (83).

Clinical studies have indicated that bacteria with
established probiotic effects (lactobacilli and bifidobac-
teria) have some promise for prevention of caries. LGG
ingested in dairy products (milk, cheese) reduced salivary
mutans streptococcal counts in adults and protected
against caries in children (84, 85). Other lactobacilli
have also been shown to reduce mutans streptococcal
counts in saliva. Lactobacillus reuteri, when delivered by
yoghurt (86), straw or tablet (87), by chewing gum (88) or
as a lozenge (89), significantly reduced the counts of
mutans streptococci in saliva (pB0.05). The short-term
consumption of yoghurt (90) or ice cream (91) containing
Bifidobacterium spp. resulted in a significant reduction in
salivary mutans streptococci (pB0.05) but not in lacto-
bacilli. Other studies have reported reductions in mutans
streptococci levels in saliva following use of probiotic-
containing yoghurts (92).

tablets containing Lactobacillus

Probiotics in prevention of periodontal diseases
There are fewer experimental studies exploring probiotic
use in periodontal diseases, partly reflecting a poorer
understanding of the precise aetiology of the disease and
of the conditions that promote health. However, patients
with moderate to severe gingivitis who were given either
one of two L. reuteri formulations had reduced plaque
and gingivitis scores compared to a placebo group (93).
Similarly, the regular (three times daily for eight weeks)
intake of
salivarius
resulted in benefits in terms of pocket probing depth
and plaque index in individuals at high risk of period-
ontal disease (smokers) compared to a placebo control
group (94). Other studies have aimed to identify organ-
isms that have the potential for probiotic action that may
protect against periodontal diseases. Some oral strains of
lactobacilli and streptococci (81, 9597) and bifidobac-
teria (98) have been reported to have in vitro inhibitory
activity against periodontal pathogens, while others are
more active against mutans streptococci (7981). The
subgingival application of beneficial oral bacteria (e.g.
salivarius and
Streptococcus
S. mitis) (replacement therapy) has been shown to delay
recolonisation by periodontal pathogens, reduce inflam-
mation, and improve bone density and bone levels in a
beagle dog model
(97)
observed that Lactobacillus gasseri strains isolated from
periodontally healthy subjects were more efficient at
inhibiting the growth of A. actinomycetemcomitans than
strains from periodontally diseased subjects, and also
inhibited the growth of P. gingivalis and P. intermedia;
this correlated with an inverse relationship between
carriage of homofermentative lactobacilli and subgingi-
val colonisation by A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gin-
givalis and P. intermedia. Ishikawa et al. (96) observed in
vitro inhibition of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and Pre-
votella nigrescens by L. salivarius. Daily ingestion of

(53). Streptococcus gordonii was recently shown to also
inhibit epithelial cell IL-6 and IL-8 secretion (52).

The mechanisms of inhibition of periodontal patho-
gens have not been fully clarified. The inhibitory activity
displayed by homofermentative lactobacilli against peri-
odontal pathogens was principally related to their
production of acid, not to H2O2 or bacteriocin produc-
tion (97). Hojo et al. (98) suggested that bifidobacteria
inhibit some black pigmented anaerobes by competing
for an essential growth factor, vitamin K, although there
was no significant relationship between higher bifido-
bacterial counts and lower black-pigmented anaerobe
counts. Recently, a bacteriocin purified from Lactobacil-
lus casei killed P. gingivalis but its use was proposed as a
novel chemotherapeutic agent rather than as strain
development for probiotic applications (101).

Many other strains of S. salivarius are reported to
produce bacteriocins or BLIS, leading to suggestions for
their usefulness as oral probiotics (106). Two salivaricin-
producing strains, when administered to children in milk,
promoted salivaricin A-like inhibitory activity in the
indigenous, resident S. salivarius populations (107). The
importance of strain selection for probiotic use is
illustrated by the fact that some S. salivarius strains
differ from K12 in some important activities; one strain
increased production of malodorous products by facil-
itating P. gingivalis metabolism of salivary mucins (108)
and another up-regulated IL-8 secretion by oral epithelial
cells (109) in contrast to the down-regulation observed in
response to K12.

Probiotics in prevention of other oral diseases
Probiotics have also been reported to reduce yeast counts
in the elderly, and may be a route to control Candida spp.
and hyposalivation in this age group (102). There have
also been clinical and laboratory studies of their potential
for preventing halitosis. Peroxide production by strains of
Weissella cibaria (commonly present in fermented foods)
isolated from the mouths of healthy children, inhibited
production of volatile sulphur compounds that contri-
bute to oral malodour by F. nucleatum in vitro and in
exhalations following mouth-rinsing by adult volunteers
with a suspension of W. cibaria (103). The success of
W. cibaria in reducing malodour may have also been
because it coaggregated efficiently with F. nucleatum
(103) and therefore competed with other late/secondary
colonisers for adhesion sites. Thus, W. cibaria may have
probiotic activities with potential
for prevention of
periodontal disease. Volatile sulphur compounds, such
as H2S and mercaptoethanol, are produced by a range of
periodontal anaerobes (104). The inhibition of these
micro-organisms by peroxide from W. cibaria may help
reduce subgingival plaque pathogenicity while its compe-
tition for coaggregation sites may reduce the reservoir of
micro-organisms available for transmission into plaque.
S. salivarius is one of the earliest colonisers of epithelial
surfaces in the human mouth and nasopharynx, and its
primary habitat is the dorsum of the healthy tongue
(28, 73). S. salivarius K12 produces salivaricin, a lanti-
biotic with inhibitory activity towards most Streptococcus
pyogenes (11). This strain has been commercially pro-
moted as a probiotic that is reported to be protective
against throat infections and oral malodour (11, 105).
S. salivarius K12 displays other activities, not related to
salivaricin production, that most likely contribute to its
probiotic properties. It down-regulated IL-8 secretion by
epithelial cells in response to pathogenic bacteria and to
the immunomodulatory host defence peptide LL-37, and
also influenced numerous cellular homeostatic pathways

Outstanding questions

Can probiotics colonise the oral cavity?
Most evidence indicates that probiotics in the gut are not
able to permanently become part of the resident gastro-
intestinal microbiota and they disappear from faeces very
soon after probiotic ingestion ends. Previous studies of
the oral microbiota would indicate that it is very difficult
to alter the composition of established plaque microbial
communities (57). A number of studies of oral colonisa-
tion following probiotic ingestion have found similar
patterns of lack of colonisation to those in the gut, in that
ingested lactobacilli colonised only transiently and dis-
appeared soon after administration of
the probiotic
ended (92, 110, 111). Colonisation with L. reuteri was
achieved in the majority of periodontal patients given a
probiotic, but the study only ran for 14 days (93). Stable
and long-term colonisation by probiotic lactobacilli
appears to have only been observed in an individual
who received LGG probiotic therapy at the age of 10
years (111). The resident microbiota of children seems to
be less stable and more subject to flux than resident
microbial communities in adults (57), and perhaps it is in
childhood that long-term influences on resident popula-
tions will be achieved.

Is colonisation of plaque essential for protection
against caries or periodontitis?
There is some evidence that colonisation of the gut by
probiotics may have beneficial systemic effects, enabling
these organisms to provide protection against diseases at
distant sites (22). Studies of the influence of L. reuteri
ATCC55730 on salivary mutans streptococci and lacto-
bacilli indicated that the benefits seen may have been due to
systemic effects rather than to the colonisation of the
mouth by the probiotic bacterium (87). Probiotics have
been effective in some chronic inflammatory diseases that
involve deregulation of the immune responses, e.g. arthritis

(page number not for citation purpose)

and Crohn’s disease. Some of the systemic effects claimed
for probiotics are immunomodulation, alteration of mucin
production, stabilisation of mucosal barriers, enhance-
ment of IgA defences, effects on neutrophils and dendritic
cells, (7, 911, 13) and enhancement of bone health
through influencing bone mineral content and structure
(20). Chronic inflammation and bone resorption contri-
bute significantly to the pathogenesis of periodontal
diseases, and it is possible to speculate that some of these
systemic effects might provide concomitant protection
against periodontal diseases. However, no studies have
been carried out providing evidence for this.

It is also possible that colonisation of one site may
provide indirect protection at other sites by mechanisms
other than systemic effects. For example, reduction of
colonisation of the tongue may reduce reservoirs for
colonisation of plaque. Supragingival plaque and sub-
gingival plaque are intimately connected, as supragingival
plaque extends down the tooth to form subgingival
plaque, so changes in supragingival plaque will influence
the future composition of subgingival plaque. Lactoba-
cilli associated with periodontal health were only rarely
isolated from subgingival samples (97). However, these
bacteria were found to inhibit the growth of certain
periodontal pathogens; it was proposed that they may
reduce the levels of these pathogens on the tongue, which
constitutes a major reservoir for their transmission, and
thereby indirectly reduce the colonisation of subgingival
plaque by periodontal pathogens.

Are current approaches targeting the right micro-
organisms?
Most oral diseases are polymicrobial in nature and result
from complex ecological shifts in the resident microbiota.
In caries, the ability of bacteria to colonize plaque,
produce acid and survive under low pH conditions are
of over-arching importance and these properties are not
restricted to a few species (112). Thus, highly targeted
approaches may have limited success as there are so many
other micro-organisms that can occupy a similar niche.
Also, there has been an emphasis on identifying probio-
tics that will have an effect on bacteria that have strong
associations with established or
for
example, strains are proposed to be potentially useful
against periodontal disease if they have inhibitory activity
against P. gingivalis or A. actinomycetemcomitans. By the
time these species are prevalent, the disease is well
established and the site is already in crisis; a more
effective therapeutic approach than to target these late
pathogens might be to inhibit the growth or activity of
those microbial consortia that are associated with the
transition from health to disease. The advances that have
occurred in the technologies used to detect and char-
acterise microbial populations are leading to a more
detailed characterisation of the microbiota associated

severe disease;

with specific phases of health and disease so this
approach is becoming a realistic possibility. Finally, there
is a widespread acceptance of the importance of oral
ecology and maintenance of hostmicrobe homeostasis in
oral health and disease (5, 113, 114). Recognition of the
activities of bacteria that contribute to disease (e.g. acid
production in caries, induction of inflammation and bone
resorption in periodontal disease) may lead to therapies
that target such activities, rather than certain species.

Are prebiotics a viable alternative or adjunct?
For a rational approach to the development of oral
prebiotics and the manipulation of the resident micro-
biota,
it is essential to know which species can be
considered to promote health and to gain some under-
standing of their metabolic needs and interactions. It is
recognised that the resident oral microbiota persists by
catabolising endogenous nutrients such as salivary pro-
teins and glycoproteins (115) and gingival crevicular
fluid.

Clearly poor diet has an impact on oral health as well
as general health, and controlling refined sugar intake
has been used for many years to control the oral ecology
and protect against caries. Similarly, xylitol has been used
to reduce acid production by mutans streptococci,
although this made no difference to the effectiveness of
a probiotic-containing chewing gum (88). Algal lectins
and cranberry juice have been suggested to reduce
adhesion of oral streptococci (116, 117). Cocoa poly-
phenols can reduce the viability and acid production by
cariogenic bacteria (118). However, while these all use
(or suggest the use of) dietary components to influence
the oral microbiota, they are not prebiotics as they inhibit
potential pathogens rather than stimulate beneficial
resident micro-organisms.

We know little about the impact of dietary components
on subgingival plaque composition. In the gut there is
some evidence collected over many years for the bene-
ficial effects of promoting populations of bifidobacteria
and lactobacilli. Koll-Klais et al. (97) found that homo-
fermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, were
more prevalent
in healthy rather than periodontally
diseased sites; their presence was inversely associated
with clinical parameters related to chronic periodontitis
and also to subgingival colonisation by periodontal
pathogens. Hojo et al. (98) also found L. gasseri, as
well as L. salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum, to be
more prevalent in healthy sites but not exclusive to
health. The same study found that Bifidobacterium spp.,
although not predominant in the mouth, were isolated
from 80% of periodontally healthy subjects and Bifido-
bacterium adolescentis was isolated from 40% of healthy
subjects and no periodontitis subjects. Counts of bifido-
bacteria were particularly high in a group of well-
maintained ex-periodontitis subjects, indicating perhaps

that these bacteria are better able to colonise sites that
have undergone plaque removal. Thus, it is possible that
prebiotic therapies that promote the growth of certain
bifidobacteria and lactobacilli may enhance periodontal
health. However,
lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are
themselves linked to caries aetiology, and it is also
difficult to envisage how a prebiotic approach to enhance
their growth would not encourage a general increase in
prevalence of aciduric and acidogenic populations that
are associated with an increased risk of dental caries.

Are there potential risks?
It is worth sounding a note of caution concerning the use
of probiotics for the purpose of preventing oral disease.
Different strains of a species may not all possess
characteristics that enable them to be probiotics and
rigorous strain selection for the disease concerned is
complex but essential (7, 18). Some probiotic strains have
been in use for many years and have excellent safety
records (119121). Most probiotic bacteria are weakly
proteolytic and, for example, Lactobacillus bulgaricus,
was shown to be incapable of degrading some host tissue
components (122). However, there have been some cases
of bacteraemia and fungaemia associated with probiotic
use, although these have been in subjects who are
immunocompromised (123, 124), or who suffer from
chronic disease (119) or short gut syndrome (125). Other
predisposing factors include prior prolonged hospitalisa-
tion and prior surgical intervention (124). An individual
who had been taking L. rhamnosus in a probiotic
preparation developed Lactobacillus endocarditis follow-
ing dental treatment (126). In Finland, however, there has
not been an increase in bacteraemia associated with
probiotic lactobacilli following the increase in the use of
these products since 1990 (127).

The species that most commonly exhibit probiotic
benefits are lactobacilli and other lactic acid bacteria,
and the production of acid is often thought to be an
important component of their protection against patho-
genic colonisation. However, Lactobacillus spp. and acid
production by acidogenic plaque populations play a
significant part in the development of caries, and a
probiotic strain of L. salivarius has been shown to be
cariogenic in a rat model (128). A number of probiotic
lactobacilli and bifidobacteria produce acid from fermen-
tation of dietary sugars in vitro (129). There are conflict-
ing data on the salivary lactobacilli
levels following
probiotic usage. Some studies have reported no effects
(91), others have found trends for an increase (1, 87),
while others have detected statistically significant rises in
counts of salivary lactobacilli (130). There is a converse
risk in that the control or prevention of caries may
indirectly affect periodontal pathogens. It has been
known for many years that streptococci, through produc-
tion of hydrogen peroxide, inhibit the growth of putative

Prospects for the development of oral probiotics and prebiotics

periodontal pathogens, leading to early proposals that
interactions between groups of micro-organisms within
plaque can influence the development of disease or
actively contribute to the maintenance of health (131),
and lactobacilli and bifidobacteria also inhibit the growth
of a range of periodontal pathogens (81, 9598, 131).

It is clear that careful selection of the strain to be
ingested for a particular disease is essential and the mode
and timing of administration can be crucial, as well as the
age and health of the individual taking the probiotic.
There is a sufficient knowledge base for major and minor
risk factors to have been proposed for administration of
probiotics to prevent intestinal conditions (119), but this
knowledge base for oral applications is clearly more
distant. One of the biggest problems to overcome may be
that the probiotic activities and micro-organisms that
protect against oral disease could increase the risk of
development of dental caries. Therefore, a prebiotic-type
approach to enhance endogenous beneficial commensals
may be more attractive. It will also be a challenge to
ensure that modes of delivery are developed that provide
sufficient retention and exposure times in the mouth that
will allow probiotics to colonise plaque or prebiotics to
enter into plaque or mucosal biofilms and influence
microbial metabolism within them.

In conclusion, the use of probiotics for use in oral care
applications is gaining momentum. There is increasing
evidence that the use of existing probiotic strains can
deliver oral health benefits. Further work will be needed
to fully optimise and quantify the extent of this benefit.
In parallel, the potential of prebiotics to maintain and
enhance the benefits provided by the resident oral
microbiota will be investigated. However, whether con-
sidering probiotics or prebiotics, it will be essential to
develop an understanding of
the broad ecological
changes induced in the mouth by their ingestion and
the long-term consequences of their use on oral health
and disease.
