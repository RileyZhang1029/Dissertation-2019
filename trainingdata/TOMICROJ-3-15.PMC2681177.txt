Abstract: A CPx-ATPase (named Bxa1) is induced in the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria brevis upon exposure to multiple 
heavy metal ions. The function of the bxa1 gene was examined by heterologous expression in both Saccharomyces cere-
visiae  (yeast)  and  Escherichia  coli.  Expression  of  bxa1  in  E.  coli  caused  Ag,  Cd  and  Zn  tolerance,  but  in  yeast  became 
sensitive  to  those  metals.  To  reveal  the  role  of  the  N-terminal  His-rich  domain  (first  35  amino  acids)  of  Bxa1,  we  con-
structed E. coli  and yeast transformants  carrying the bxa1 ((cid:2)35bxa1). The E.  coli  transformant with  (cid:2)35bxa1 was sensi-
tive to heavy metals. On the other hand, the yeast (cid:2)35bxa1 transformant increased heavy-metal tolerance than bxa1 trans-
formant. Fluorescence  microscopy suggested that  the  two  fusion proteins Bxa1::mGFP and (cid:2)35Bxa1::mGFP are mainly 
localized in yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These results imply that the function of Bxa1 was lost by the N-terminus 
deletion in both E. coli and yeast transformants. This is the first report that the His-rich domain in O. brevis Bxa1 is essen-
tial not only to monovalent (Ag+ and Cu+) but also to divalent (Cd2+ and Zn2+) heavy metal tolerance. Moreover, we clari-
fied the toxicity mechanism against Cd using yeast transformants. 

INTRODUCTION 

  Heavy  metals  are  generally  ubiquitous  and  persistent 
environmental  pollutants  that  are  introduced  into  the  envi-
ronment  through  anthropogenic  activities.  Many  organisms 
generally  utilize  their  own  tolerance  mechanisms  to  achieve 
resistance  to  heavy  metals  [1,  2],  such  as  facilitated  efflux, 
reduced  influx,  chelation  (e.g.,  metallothionein,  phyto-
chelatin  and  organic  acids)  and  partitioning  (e.g.,  vacuole). 
CPx-ATPases  (or  P-type  ATPases)  have  been  studied  and 
thought  to  act  as  a  potential  key  heavy-metal  transporter  in-
volved  not  only  in  metal  ion  homeostasis,  but  also  in  heavy 
metal  tolerance  [3,  4].  Various  CPx-ATPases  have  been 
identified  from  prokaryotes  to  eukaryotes  including  mam-
mals  and  characterized  functionally  [5-8].  They  commonly 
have high specificity for heavy-metal ions, which they trans-
port  and  the  transported  substrates  depend  on  heavy-metal 
ion valence [8-11].  

  The  CPx-ATPase  gene,  bxa1,  was  isolated  from  the 
freshwater  cyanobacterium  Oscillatoria  brevis  and  it  can  be 
induced  at  almost  the  same  level  by  both  monovalent  (Cu+ 
and Ag+) and divalent (Zn2+ and Cd2+) heavy metal ions [12]. 
However,  the  function  of  this  protein  for  these  stresses  still 
remains  unknown.  Many  CPx-ATPases  contain  a  highly 
conserved  characteristic  cysteine-rich  (CXXC)n  domain  in 
the  polar  amino-terminal  region  and  this  domain  can  be  re-
placed  by  a  histidine  (His)-containing  motif  [13].  The  Bxa1 
N-terminus includes two adjoining Cys residues and His-rich 
(11  His)  motif.  This  domain  has  been  suggested  to  be  in-
volved  in  metal  binding  [12],  but  the  exact  role  of  the  His-
rich domain has not been investigated. 

  Heterologous  expression  in  yeast  is  a  convenient  system 
and has been well used for characterization of the role of the

heavy  metal  transporters  derived  from  a  variety  of  organ-
isms. The Escherichia coli ZntA can confer Cd and Pb resis-
tance to yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana by an efflux of these 
ions  to  outside  [14].  Both  CPx-ATPases  derived  from  A. 
thaliana  and  a  heavy  metal  hyperaccumulator,  Thalaspi 
caerulescense, can also confer heavy metal tolerance to yeast 
[15, 16].  

 
In  this  study,  we  used  the  heterologous  expression  in 
both  E.  coli  and  yeast  to  characterize  of  the  role  of  Bxa1. 
Our  results  suggested  that  the  deleted  Bxa1  lost  its  function 
by the deletion of the His-rich domain. This is the first report 
that  the  N-terminal  His-rich  domain  of  O.  brevis  Bxa1  is 
responsible for tolerance not only to monovalent (Ag/Cu) but 
also  to  divalent  (Cd/Zn)  heavy  metals.  Furthermore,  we 
clarified  the  toxicity  mechanism  against  Cd  using  the  yeast 
transformant. 

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY 

Media and Growth Conditions 

Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  wild-type  strain,  BY4742 
 
(MAT(cid:1),  his3(cid:2)1,  leu2(cid:2)0,  lys2(cid:2)0,  ura3(cid:2)0)  was  provided  by 
Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany). A  synthetic medium, Yeast 
Nitrogen  Base  (YNB)  (Q-BIOgene  Inc.,  US)  medium  sup-
plemented  with  2%  glucose  and  0.05  g/l  amino  acids  (His, 
Leu  and  Lys)  and  0.1  g/l  uracil  were  used  for  preculture  of 
yeast  cells  at  30(cid:1).  YNB  medium  was  used  with  additional 
1.94%  (w/v)  galactose  and  0.06%  (w/v)  glucose  for  induc-
tion  during  the  heavy  metal  sensitivity  test  on  solid  media 
(1.5%  agar  in  YNB  medium).  For  fluorescence  microscopy, 
2% galactose and 2% raffinose were used as carbon sources 
to induce the gene-expression of bxa1 and its deletion series 
in yeast. In the other experiments, 2% glucose was used as a 
carbon source. 
  E.  coli  strain  Top10  and  two  vectors,  pCR®2.1  and 
pBAD/Myc-His  B,  were  purchased  from  Invitrogen  (US).

Luria-Bertani (LB) media and LB agar plates (1.5 % agar in 
LB media) were used for cultivation of E. coli at 37(cid:2).
Heavy Metal Sensitivity Tests on Agar Plates 
 
In  agar  plate  tests  using  yeast  transformants,  YNB  me-
dium  containing  various  concentrations  of  heavy  metals, 
AgNO3 (0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6  (cid:1)M), CuSO4 (0, 0.5, 1 and 1.25 
mM), CdCl2 (0, 1, 10, 20 and 30  (cid:1)M) and ZnCl2 (0, 5, 7.5, 
10  and  15  mM)  were  solidified  with  1.5%  agar.  Log-phase 
cells were diluted with YNB medium to OD600 1.0 and then 
spotted on the YNB agar plates.  
In sensitivity tests using E. coli transformants, log-phase 
 
cells were inoculated to an LB medium including 0.008% L-
arabinose  and  then  cultured  for  4  h  at  37(cid:2)  to  induce  the 
bxa1  genes.  After  adjustment  of  initial  cell  densities,  cells 
were spotted on YNB (adjusted to pH 6.5) agar plates contain-
ing various concentrations of AgNO3 (0, 1.0 and 2.25  (cid:1)M), 
CdCl2 (0, 0.75 and 1.0 mM) and ZnSO4 (0, 1.5 and 2.5 mM).  
 
Sensitivity to heavy metals was estimated by the colony-
forming ability on the agar plates  after 4 d of incubation at 

30(cid:2) for yeast and after 2 d of incubation at 37(cid:2)(cid:1)for E. coli,
respectively. 
Construction  of  Vectors  for  Expression  in  Yeast  Trans-
formants 
  The open reading frame (ORF) of bxa1 was amplified by 
PCR using O. brevis genomic DNA as a template. Two nu-
cleotides,  Bxa1-ORF5’  BamHI:  cacaggatccaggcataagccaaaa 
cccaga  and  Bxa1-ORF3’  XhoI:  cacactcgagattgcccgccctcctg, 
were used as gene specific primers in this reaction. The re-
sulting  product was  subcloned  into  the  pCR®2.1  vector  and 
sequenced to confirm its  DNA sequence.  This plasmid was 
digested with BamHI and XhoI to create each restriction site 
in the 5’  end and 3’ end of bxa1 ORF, allowing the  subse-
quent cloning of the full length of the ORF into a yeast ex-
pression  vector,  pYES2  (Invitrogen,  US).  The  resulting 
plasmid was designated pEN108 (Fig. 1A). As pYES2  car-
ries the GAL1 promoter, the expression level of the inserted 
gene  in  the  downstream  region  of  this  promoter  can  be  in-
duced by galactose in the YNB medium.

Role of N-Terminal His-rich Domain of Oscillatoria Brevis Bxa1 

The Open Microbiology Journal, 2009, Volume 3    17 

  A  truncated  version  of  bxa1  gene  ((cid:1)35bxa1),  with  the 
first 35 amino acids from the N-terminal region deleted, was 
also  cloned  into  the  pYES2  vector  using  as  forward  primer 
(cid:1)35Bxa1-ORF5’ BamHI: cacaggatccatgggcaacggagattttaacc-
tca.  The  reaction  was  conducted  using  the  reverse  primer 
Bxa1-ORF3’  XhoI.  A  plasmid  carrying  (cid:1)35bxa1  designated 
pEN118 was generated. To confirm the localization of Bxa1 
in yeast transformant cells, we constructed BY4742 carrying 
fusion genes, bxa1::mGFP (modified Green Fluorescent Pro-
tein)  and  (cid:1)35bxa1::mGFP  (Fig.  1).  The  mGFP  gene  was  a 
yeast-specific GFP and kindly supplied from Dr. E. Delhaize 
(CSIRO, Australia). Plasmid pEN108 and pEN118 (Fig. 1A) 
was digested with XhoI at 37(cid:1) for 3h (Fig. 1B). 

  Using  Bxa1-GFP-F:  ggggtggctttagcagctattttcaatgcaac-
tagagttttaaagatgagaggagaagaacttttcactgg as a forward primer 
and  pYES2Ter-R:  gggagggcgtgaatgtaag  cgtgacataactaatta-
catgatttatttgtatagttcatccatgcca  as  a  reverse  primer,  mGFP 
was  amplified  by  PCR  from  the  mGFP  DNA  fragment  to 
attach homologous recombination sequences to the both end 
of  the  mGFP  (Fig.  1C).  The  sequence  in  bold  was  derived 
from  the  3’  terminal  region  of  the  bxa1  and  the  underlined 
sequence  came  from  mGFP.  The  italic  characters  were  de-
rived  from  the  5’-terminator  region  of  the  CYC1  transcrip-
tion terminator in pYES2. PCR was performed for 30 cycles 
(denaturing  at 94(cid:1) for 60 s, annealing at 55(cid:1) for 60 s and 
extension  at  72(cid:1)  for  120  s).  The  linearized  plasmid 
(pEN108  or  pEN118)  digested  with  XhoI  (Fig.  1B)  and  the 
PCR product (C'-bxa1::mGFP::5'-Ter) (Fig. 1C) were mixed 
together  and  then  introduced  into  BY4742  to  cause  a  ho-
mologous  recombination  between the  common  region  of  the 
two  fragments  in  vivo.  The  generated  plasmids  (Fig.  1D) 
were  designated  pEN111  (bxa1::mGFP)  and  pEN122 
((cid:1)35bxa1::mGFP),  respectively.  Yeast  cells  carrying  these 
plasmids  were  monitored  for  the  localization  of  the  fusion 
proteins.  

Construction  of  Vectors  for  Expression  in  E.  coli  
Transformants 

  The E.  coli transformant carrying bxa1 or  (cid:1)35bxa1 were 
also  constructed.  ORF  of bxa1  was  amplified  by  PCR  using 
pEN108  as  a  template  and  Bxa1-ORF3’  XbaI:  cacatcta-
gaaactttaaaactctagttgcattgaaaatagct  as  a  common  reverse 
primer.  Two  nucleotide  primers,  Bxa1-ORF5’  XhoI:  cacac-
tcgagcatgcaaaaagccaaatcgagc  and  (cid:1)35Bxa1-ORF5’XhoI: 
cacactcgagccggcaacggagattttaacct  were  used  as  forward 
primers  in  this  PCR.  After  double  digestion  with  XhoI  and 
XbaI, each DNA fragment was inserted into pBAD/ Myc-His 
B.  Generated  plasmids  carrying bxa1  and  (cid:1)35bxa1  were  se-
quenced  and  then  designated  pEN127  and  pEN129,  respec-
tively. 

Influx and Efflux of Cd Ions in Yeast Transformants 

  Log-phase  cells  grown  in  YNB  medium  at  30  (cid:1)  were 
centrifuged,  suspended  in  fresh  YNB  medium  including  a 
final concentration of 10 (cid:1)M Cd and then incubated at 30 (cid:1) 
for  3  h  (Cd  influx  period).  The  Cd-treated  cells  were  spun 
down and washed with 10 mM EDTA once  and with deion-
ized water twice to remove unabsorbed Cd from the cell sur-
face.  The  washed  cells  were  furthermore  suspended  in  fresh 
YNB  medium  without  Cd  and  then  grown  at  30  (cid:1)  for  an-
other  3  h  (Cd  efflux  period).  During  the  cultivation,  cells 
were harvested every 3 h (0, 3 and 6 h), then washed with 10 

mM  EDTA  once  and  with  deionized  water  twice.  The  cell 
density of each sample was adjusted to 0.75 by OD600 value. 
Cd-treated  cell  samples  were  subsequently  decomposed  by 
the  treatment  with  HNO3  at  120  (cid:1)  for  15  min  and  the  Cd 
content  was  determined  using  a  polarized  Zeeman  atomic 
absorption spectrophotometer Z-9000 (Hitachi, Ltd., Japan). 

Microscopic Observations of Yeast Transformants  

  Yeast  transformant  carrying  pEN111  or  pEN122  was 
used  for  fluorescence  microscopy.  Over-night  culture  of 
yeast  transformants  were  transferred  to  fresh  YNB  medium, 
including 2% galactose and 2% raffinose as the final concen-
trations,  and  grown  for  8  h  to  induce  expression  of  mGFP 
fusion  genes.  Staining  by  3,  3’-dihexyloxacarbocyanine  io-
dide  (DiOC6,  Molecular  Probes,  US),  an  indicator  of  the 
yeast ER membrane, was performed according to Poster and 
Dean [17].  Nuclei-specific staining was carried out using 4', 
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  dihydrochloride  (DAPI,  Do-
jindo  Laboratories,  Japan).  Observations  were  performed 
using  a  fluorescence  microscope,  BH-2  RFCA  (Olympus, 
Japan)  with  appropriate  filters.  Fluorescence  images  were 
captured  using  a  digital  camera  (FinePix  S2Pro,  Fujifilm, 
Japan).  

  These  yeast  transformants  were  also  used  for  both  trans-
mission  electron  microscopy  (TEM)  by  H7100  (Hitachi, 
Ltd.,  Japan)  and  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM)  by 
Quanta  400  (FEI  Company,  US)  to  observe  internal  proper-
ties and morphological properties of yeast cells, respectively. 
Glutaraldehyde/permanganate  fixation  for  TEM  and  glu-
taraldehyde/osmium oxide fixation for SEM were carried out 
according to Wright [18] with modification. 

Statistical Analyses 

  Experimental values were expressed as mean ± SE in this 
study.  The  mean  values  of  statistical  significance  were  per-
formed  by  one-way  analysis  of  variance.  Post  hoc  compari-
son  of  individual  experimental  groups  was  done  using  the 
Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test.  

RESULTS 

Expression of Bxa1 Gene in Yeast and E. coli  

  To analyze the role of O. brevis bxa1 in heavy-metal tox-
icity in eukaryotes in detail, we constructed a yeast transfor-
mant  carrying bxa1 and used it for the heavy metal sensitiv-
ity  test.  The bxa1 transformant showed a slight growth inhi-
bition under conditions without heavy metals. Moreover, the 
bxa1  transformant  was  sensitive  to  all  tested  heavy  metals 
compared  to  the  control  transformants  (Fig.  2).  It  also 
seemed  that  there  is  a  difference  in  sensitivity  of  the  bxa1 
cells  among  the  tested  heavy  metals.  To  test  whether  the 
observed  growth  inhibition  in  yeast  was  actually  associated 
with  the  expressed  bxa1,  we  obtained  spontaneous  ura-  seg-
regated  cells  from  the  ura+  transformant  (BY4742  carrying 
the bxa1) by cultivation in YNB medium supplemented with 
uracil.  Consequently,  the  ura-  segregated  cells,  which  lost 
pEN108, recovered the heavy metal sensitivity similar to the 
parental  cells  (BY4742)  (data  not  shown).  These  results 
strongly suggested that the observed phenotypes in the bxa1 
transformant were bxa1 dependent.  

  To  compare  the  heavy  metal  sensitivity  between  yeast 
and  E.  coli,  we  constructed  two E.  coli  transformants  carry-

formant and (cid:1)35bxa1 transformant, were grown in YNB. Ag sensitivity test (A), Cu sensitivity test (B), Cd sensitivity test (C) and Zn sensi-
tivity test (D). Log-phase cells of these strains were adjusted to OD600 1.0, serially diluted (1/20, 1/100, 1/500, 1/2500) and then spotted on 
YNB agar plates containing various concentrations of heavy metals. Plates were incubated at 30(cid:1) for 4 d. 

ing pEN127 or pBAD/Myc-His B. The E. coli transformant 
carrying  bxa1  was  more  tolerant  to  heavy  metals  (Ag,  Cd 
and Zn) than the control transformant (Fig. 3). These results 
clearly  indicated  that  expression  of  bxa1  conferred  heavy 
metal tolerance (Ag, Cd and Zn) to E. coli cells. As E. coli
cells  generally  have  CopA,  as  a  Cu  efflux  transporter  [19], 
the Cu sensitivity test using the E. coli transformant was not 
performed. 
Expression of Truncated bxa1 in Yeast and E. coli
  To  investigate  the  function  of  the  N-terminal  region  of 
Bxa1  protein,  we  constructed  transformants  of  yeast  and  E
coli  carrying  (cid:1)35bxa1.  Expression  of  (cid:1)35bxa1  in  yeast  did 
not  affect  the  growth  in  a  heavy  metal-free  condition  (Fig. 
2). Sensitivity to the tested heavy metals was ameliorated by 
deletion  of  the  bxa1  gene.  Thus,  all  transformants  showed 
heavy  metal  tolerance  as  follows;  pYES2  transformant  > 
(cid:1)35bxa1  transformant  >  bxa1  transformant.  These  results 

suggested  that  deletion  of  the  N-terminal  of  Bxa1  caused  a 
loss  of  the  function  of  this  gene.  Segregation  of  (cid:1)35bxa1
plasmid from the yeast transformant was also performed, and 
the  segregants  showed  phenotypes  similar  to  their  patent 
cells. 
  The  E.  coli  transformants  carrying  (cid:1)35bxa1  was  also 
applied to the heavy metal test (Ag, Cd and Zn) (Fig. 3). The 
(cid:1)35bxa1 transformant revealed a heavy-metal tolerance level 
similar  to  the  control  transformant  carrying  pBAD/Myc-
HisB. These results indicated that the N-terminal domain of 
Bxa1 is essential to the tolerance phenotype for Ag, Cd and 
Zn in E. coli.
Localization of Bxa1 and (cid:1)35Bxa1 within Yeast Cell 
  Why did the bxa1 show different heavy metal sensitivity 
in yeast and E. coli? To address this question, we determined 
the  localization  of  Bxa1  in  yeast  cells  (Fig.  4A).  pEN111 
carrying  the  bxa1::mGFP  and  the  control  plasmid  carrying

Fig. (3). Heavy metal sensitivity tests of the constructed E. coli transformants. Three transformants, pBAD/ Myc-HisB transformant (con-
trol), bxa1 transformant and (cid:1)35bxa1 transformant, were grown in YNB + L-arabinose. Ag sensitivity test (A), Cd sensitivity test (B) and 
Zn sensitivity test (C). Log-phase cells of these strains were adjusted to OD600 1.0, serially diluted (1/20, 1/100, 1/500, 1/2500) and then 
spotted on YNB agar plates containing various concentrations of heavy metals. Plates were incubated at 37(cid:1) for 2 d. 

mGFP were introduced into BY4742. By fluorescent micro-
scopic observation, we detected most of the fluorescent sig-
nal derived from  mGFP homogenously  in  the  cytoplasm of 
the  control  transformants  (8  h,  BY4742  carrying  mGFP)
(Fig.  4A  b).  Compared  with  the  control  transformants,  the 
fluorescent  signal  derived  from  the  bxa1::mGFP  transfor-
mants was mainly detected as a ring (Fig. 4A d). The light-
blue DAPI fluorescent signal showing the nuclear region was 
detected in the center of the ring within the same cell carry-
ing  the  bxa1::mGFP  (Fig.  4A  c). (cid:1)35Bxa1::mGFP  fusion 
protein also showed localization similar to Bxa1::mGFP as a 
ring (data not shown). These results indicated that deletion of 
the N-terminal domain did not change the localization of the 
truncated protein in yeast cells.  
  The localization of our Bxa1 in yeast cells was confirmed 
by  double  staining  of  yeast  cells  using  DAPI  and  DiOC6
(Fig. 4B). The fluorescent signal derived from DiOC6 show-
ing a ring similar to Bxa1::mGFP was detected surrounding 
the nuclei in the two transformants (Fig. 4B b and d). These 
results suggested that Bxa1 is localized in the ER region. 
Influx and Efflux of Cd Ion in the Yeast Transformants 
  To  clarify  the  toxic  mechanism  by  Bxa1  in  yeast  cells, 
the  Cd  content  in  the  three  transformants  during  both  Cd 

uptake and release were determined (Table 1). There was no 
significant  difference  in  Cd  influx  among  the  tested  trans-
formants.  Compared  with  the  end  of  the  Cd  uptake  period, 
the control and transformant carrying  (cid:1)35bxa1 showed 51.7 
and 55.5% decrease of relative Cd content at the end of the 
release  period,  respectively.  The  relative  Cd  content  was 
decreased  16.4%  in  the  transformants  carrying  bxa1  under 
the same condition. These results implied that the N-terminal 
region of Bxa1 is related to the transport activity of Cd.
Morphological  Changes  Caused  by  Cd  Treatment  in 
Yeast Cells 
  Our  results  suggested  the  possibility  that  some  critical 
changes in the metabolism occurred by  expression of  Bxa1 
in  the  ER  region  in  the  Cd-treated  transformants.  To  eluci-
date this possibility, we observed the Cd-treated yeast trans-
formants  (100  (cid:1)M  Cd  treatment  for  5  h  at  30(cid:1))  by  SEM 
(Fig.  5A).  Compared  with  BY4742  carrying  pYES2,  the 
transformant  expressing  bxa1  exhibited  a  spherical  shape 
(L/W ratio of pYES2 transformant and bxa1 transformant are 
1.3  and  1.1,  respectively)  and  smaller  cell  size  (Table  2). 
pYES2 and bxa1 transformants under Cd treatment relatively 
increased approximately 1.2 and 1.4 times larger in cell area 
than their respective non-treated condition (Fig. 5A).

sults  indicated  that  Cd  treatment  causes  severer  fragmenta-
tion of the vacuole in the bxa1 transformants (approximately 
2.8 to 3.1 times) than in control cells.

yeast cells were visualized by DAPI staining in a and c.
  To establish whether expression of the bxa1 specifically 
affects  the  ultrastructure  of  the  yeast  transformant,  we  per-
formed TEM observation using the three yeast transformants 
grown under a 100 (cid:1)M Cd condition for 5 h (Fig. 5B, photo 
data for  (cid:1)35bxa1 were not shown). There was no clear dif-
ference  in  ultrastructure  within  the  cells  among  the  three 
tested transformants under the Cd-free condition. In the con-
trol cells, 6.4% of the untreated cells had fragmented vacu-
oles  and this number  increased to 11.3% (1.8  times) by  Cd 
treatment.  Our  two  bxa1  transformants  showed  fragmenta-
tion  in  the  range  of  10.6-14.8%  and  32.5-41.6%  in  the  ab-
sence and presence of Cd treatment, respectively. These re-

DISCUSSION 
  The E. coli transformant carrying the full length of bxa1
can show clear tolerance to Ag, Cd and Zn. On the contrary, 
expression of bxa1 caused sensitivity to heavy metals in the 
yeast transformant. These results suggested that Bxa1 plays a 
role  in  heavy  metal  toxicity.  Heterologous  expression  of 
CPx-ATPase  derived  from  cyanobacterial  transporter  in 
yeast cell is the first report, to our knowledge. We also con-
structed  and  characterized  E.  coli  and  yeast  transformants 
carrying the (cid:1)35bxa1. Consequently, sensitivity to the tested

heavy  metals  was  changed  in  both  E.  coli  and  yeast  trans-
formants. E. coli (cid:1)35bxa1 transformants became sensitive to 
the  tested  three  heavy  metals  than  the  bxa1  transformant 
(Fig. 3). In yeast, the  (cid:1)35bxa1 transformant was more toler-
ant  to the tested heavy metals (Ag, Cu, Cd and Zn)  than the 
bxa1 transformant (Fig. 2). Our  influx/efflux  experiments  in 
yeast  transformants  indicate  that  the  His-rich  domain  is  im-
portant for heavy metal tolerance (Table 1).  Taken together, 
our  yeast  and  E.  coli  transformant  experiments  indicate  that 
the N-terminal His-rich domain in Bxa1 is involved in heavy 
metal  tolerance.  Arguello  [13]  described  that  the  His-
containing  motifs  in  CPx-ATPases  are  heavy-metal  binding 
regions. However, their roles were limited to either monova-
lent or divalent heavy metal ions as transport substrates. We 
revealed  that the N-terminal double Cys motif following the 
His-rich (11 His) motif of O. brevis  Bxa1  is  essential to  tol-
erance  against  both  monovalent  and  divalent  heavy  metal 
ions. The yeast transformant carrying the bxa1 causes a par-
tial growth inhibition under without heavy metals (Fig. 2). A 
transportation  and  accumulation  of  trace  metals  to  ER  may 
occur even under untreated condition, because our yeast me-
dia includes Cu and Zn as essential trace element.  

  DiOC6  is  a  unique  dye  for  yeast  ER  membrane  staining 
[17].  However,  green  fluorescent  signals  derived  from 
DiOC6  and  mGFP  in  one  cell  cannot  be  discriminated  using 
a  microscopic  detection  system.  To  detect  the  ER  localiza-
tion  within  the  yeast  cell,  we  performed  double  staining  us-
ing  DAPI  and  DiOC6  in  this  study.  The  green  fluorescent 
signal  derived  from  DiOC6  was  also  detected  as  a  ring  sur-
rounding  the  nucleus  like  Bxa1::mGFP  (Fig. 4).  Our  results 
strongly suggested that  the  Bxa1::mGFP  mainly  localized in 
ER. Localization of (cid:1)35Bxa1::mGFP implies that the first 35 
amino acids in the N-terminal of Bxa1 are not a determinant 
for  the  localization  of  this  protein  in  the  yeast  cell.  Tong  et 
al.  reported  that  Bxa1  localizes  in  cell  membrane  in  E.  coli 
cell  [12]  and  (cid:1)35Bxa1  may  also  localize  in  cell  membrane. 
In case of E. coli transformant carrying the bxa1, localization 
of  Bxa1  transporter  in  cell  membrane  can  properly  function 
for  heavy  metal  tolerance. We  suppose  that  the  heavy-metal 
sensitive  phenotype  observed  in  yeast  bxa1  transformants  is 
due to the localization of Bxa1 in ER. ER is considered to be 
sensitive to Cd2+ in both fission and budding yeasts [10, 20]. 
Bxa1 localized in ER probably promotes an accumulation of 
heavy  metals  in  ER  by  its  transport  activity  and  causes  a 
disturbance of protein synthesis.  

In this study, we also found that Cd toxicity leads to two 
 
physiological  features  in  our  yeast  transformants.  First,  Cd 

treatment causes cell expansion (Fig. 5A and Table 2). Simi-
lar cell expansion by Cd treatment has also been observed in 
both Dunaliella salina and Chlamydomonas bullosa [21]. No 
answer  has  been  obtained  whether  cell  expansion  is  a  toxic 
or  a  resistant  mechanism  against  Cd  in  microorganisms. 
Second,  Cd  treatment  also  leads  to  fragmentation  of  the 
vacuole  in  yeast  cells  (Fig.  5B).  Compared  with  the  non-
treated  condition,  vacuole  fragmentation  is  increased  by  Cd 
treatment  in  both  the  control  and  a  series  of  bxa1  transfor-
mants  with  different  frequencies.  Vacuole  fragmentation  is 
also  induced  upon  exposure  to  lipid  peroxides  originating 
from  the  peroxidation  of  (cid:2)-6-polyunsaturated  fatty  acids,(cid:1)
and Ni2+ [22, 23]. We revealed that Cd treatment leads to the 
vacuole fragmentation in yeast.
