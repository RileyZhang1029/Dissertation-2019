The long belief that dental primary afferent (DPA) neurons are entirely composed of nociceptive neurons has been challenged 
by several anatomical and functional investigations. In order to characterize non-nociceptivepopulation among DPA neurons, 
retrograde transport fluorescent dye was placed in upper molars of rats and immunohistochemical detection of peripherin and 
neurofilament 200 in the labeled trigeminal ganglia was performed. As the results, majority ofDPA neurons were peripherin-
expressing small-sized neurons, showing characteristic ofnociceptive C-fi bers. However, 25.7% of DPA were stained with antibody 
against neurofi lament 200, indicating signifi cant portion of DPA neurons are related to large myelinated Aβ fi bers. Th  ere were a 
small number of neurons thatexpressed both peripherin and neurofilament 200, suggestive of Aδ fibers. The possible transition 
of neurochemical properties by neuronal injury induced by retrograde labeling technique was ruled out by detection of minimal 
expression of neuronal injury marker, ATF-3. These results suggest that in addition to the large population of C-fiber-related 
nociceptive neurons, a subset of DPA neurons is myelinated large neurons,which is related to low-threshold mechanosensitive Aβ 
fi bers. We suggest that these Aβ fi ber-related neurons might play a role as mechanotransducers of fl uid movement within dentinal 
tubules.

and psychological investigation of structure and function of 
nociceptive sensory system [2, 3]. Th  e assumption that tooth pulp 
neurons comprise only nociceptors is based on the observation 
that human tooth pulp produces only pain in response to noxious 
and non-noxious physical stimuli [4-6]. However, several reports 
suggest that tooth pulp neurons are not entirely consisted of 
nociceptors, based on observation of non-nociceptive sensory 
perception in response to subthreshold electrical stimulation 
of human teeth [2, 7, 8]. More recently published reports argue 
that majority of dental afferent neurons are non-nociceptive 
mechanoreceptors [9-12]. Therefore, it is crucial to determine

whether dental primary aff erent neurons are purely nociceptors or 
not in order to understand the sensory system of oral cavity.
In an attempt to characterize the nociceptive and non-nociceptive 
neurons among the dental primary afferent neurons, we have 
previously investigated the expression of several nociceptor-
related receptors by electrophysiological analysis, single cell RT-
PCR and immunohistochemical studiesand found out that not 
all of the dental primary aff erent neurons expressed nociception-
related receptors [13, 14]. To confirm the non-nociceptive 
population of dental primary afferent neuronsfurther, we 
investigated the neurochemical properties of retrogradely labeled 
dental primary aff erent neurons in this study. Nociceptive neurons 
have smaller diameter unmyelinated or thinly myelinated axons 
and exhibit slower conduction velocity, whereas non-nociceptive 
large-diameter thickly myelinatedneurons have higher conduction 
velocity. Since it was diffi  cult to measure the conduction velocity 
of single fibers, slowly conducting neurons and fast conducting 
neurons wasdistinguished by detecting diff erential neurochemical 
properties. In this study, we investigated the expression of 
peripherin and neurofilament 200 as markers for small neurons 
and myelinated neurons, respectively [15-17], in retrogradely 
labeled trigeminal ganglion neurons to determine whether dental 
primary aff erent neurons are pure nociceptors or not. In addition, 
we examined whether our retrograde labeling methods caused 
neuronal damage, which could have affected the neurochemical 
properties of dental primary aff erent neurons.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals
All surgical and experimental procedures were reviewed and 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
at Seoul National University. Animal treatments were performed 
according to the Guidelines of the International Association for 
the Study of Pain. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 
weighing 180~200 g at the time of surgery) were used. Rats 
were housed at a temperature of 23±2oC with a 12-hour light-
dark cycle and fed food and water ad libitum. The animals were 
allowed to habituate to the housing facilities for 1 week before the 
experiments, and eff orts were made to limit distress to the animals.

Retrograde labeling
Trigeminal ganglion neurons were retrograde-labeled with a 
fluorescent dye, 1,1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’-tetramethylindocarbo 
cyanine perchlorate (DiI; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), 
as previously described [13, 18-20]. Briefly, cavities were drilled 
in 2 or 3 left  and right upper molars and DiI crystals were placed 

Non-Nociceptive Neurons in Dental Pulp

into the cavity. Pulp exposure was avoided or minimized during 
the cavity preparation. Temporary sealing material (Caviton®; 
GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was placed on the DiI to prevent 
spread of leaked tracer.Rats were fi xed for immunohistochemical 
analysis two weeks aft er application of DiI.

Immunofl uorescent staining
Rats were perfused with physiological saline and sequentially 
with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 
7.4) at14 days after DiI placement. The trigeminal ganglion was 
removed and immersed in the postfixative at 4oC overnight and 
then transferred to 10% to 30% sucrose in PBS for 48 hours. Serial 
frozen transverse sections (14 μm thickness) were mounted on 
gelatin-coated slides. All immunohistochemical procedures 
were performed at room temperature unless otherwise stated. 
Slides were washed in PBS and then incubated in the blocking 
solution containing 5% normal goat serum, 2% BSA, 2% FBS, 
and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 hour at room temperature. The 
sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with either mouse anti-
neurofilament 200 antibody (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, 
MO, USA), goat anti-peripherin antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or rabbit anti-ATF3 
antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Sections were 
then washed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with 
a FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG(H+L) antibody 
(1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA), 
FITC conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG(H+L) antibody (1:200; 
Jackson ImmunoResearch) and FITC conjugated donkey anti-
rabbit IgG(H+L) antibody (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch) 
for 1 hour. Th  e sections were mounted with Vectashield® (Vector 
Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) and visualized using 
a confocal microscope using the appropriate filter sets (FV-300; 
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). 18 to 24 sections were used for counting 
the number of neurons that were stained with each antibody.

Inferior alveolar nerve transection injury
Transection injury of the inferior alveolar nervewas performed 
in accordance to the original description of Kim et al. [21]. Briefl y, 
aft er anesthetizing the animals with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/ 
kg, ip), the facial skin over the left  masseteric muscle was cut and 
the mandibular bone was exposed. Th  e inferior alveolar nervewas 
exposed by carefully removing the surface bone covering the 
inferior alveolar nerve. The left inferior alveolar nervewas 
transectioned where the nerve trunk lies just beneath the coronoid 
process, and cutaneous tissues were then sutured. Th  e contralateral 
sides were left  intact in all rats.

RESULTS

Majority of DiI-labeled neurons was stained with peripherin
Retrograde transport fluorescent dye, DiI, placed in upper 
molars was detected as bright red dots in trigeminal ganglion 
sections. Dental primary afferent neurons were identified as a 
small subset of neurons that were stained with DiI (Fig. 1A). When 
upper molars were extracted and examined for confinement 
of DiI within dental pulp after the animals weresacrificed, 
DiI was observed only within the dental pulp, suggesting that 
unintended labeling of trigeminal ganglion neurons was minimal. 
As expected, DiI labeled neurons were detected only in the 
maxillary regions of the trigeminal ganglion (data not shown). Th  e 
trigeminal ganglion was extensively stained with antibody against 
peripherin, a marker for small neurons. Out of 184±73 DiI-labeled 
neurons that were analyzed from 10 rats, average of 130±49 
neuronsshowedimmunoreactivity to peripherin (72.3±8.5%), 
suggesting that the majority of dental primary afferent neurons 
were small-sized neurons (Fig. 1B).

A small subpopulation of tooth pulp neurons was stained 
with NF200
Myelinated population among dental primary afferent 
neurons was identified by the detection of neurofilament 200 
(NF200), a marker of myelinated neurons. Fig. 2A shows that 
a significant portion of trigeminal ganglion neurons exhibited 

immunoreactivity to NF200. Compared with immunohistological 
result obtained with antibody against peripherin, NF200 positive 
neurons showed tendency of large diameter.Approximately 
25.7±9.9% (n=54±34/197±71) amongDiI-labeled dentin primary 
aff erent neurons showed immunoreactivity to NF200 (Fig. 2B).

Size distribution of peripherin or NF200 positive tooth pulp 
neurons
As expected, immunohistochemical analysis revealed prefe-
rential expression of peripherin in cytosol of small-sized neurons, 
whose size ranged between 100 μm2 and 1,000 μm2 (Fig. 3). 
Ave rage area of peripherin positive neurons was 511.8±195 
μm2. NF200 was mostly detected in relatively larger cells, whose 
soma ranged between 700 μm2 and 1,800 μm2 with an average of 
1205.4±274 μm2 (Fig. 3). Th  ere are small number of neurons that 
were reacted to both antibodies against peripherin and NF200 
(Supplementray Fig. 1A).

Dye placement surgery of tooth pulp did not induce neuro-
nal damage
Since it is possible that DiI placement surgery performed in the 
upper molars might damage the dental primary aff erent neurons 
innervated in the tooth pulp, and the injured neurons might show 
modified expression of cytoskeletons, expression of neuronal 
injury marker, cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor 3 
(ATF-3) was investigated in trigeminal ganglion to eliminate the

neurons, neurochemical properties of dental primary afferent 
neurons were determined by immunohistochemical analysis of 
retrogradely labeled trigeminal ganglion neurons in this study. 
Peripherin and NF200 [15-17] were used as markers for small 
neurons and myelinated neurons, respectively. As the results, 
72.3±8.52% of labeled neurons exhibited characteristics of 
C-fi ber-related nociceptive neurons, such as small size,expression 
of peripherin and lack of NF200. However, 25.7±9.9% of neurons 
wasstained with the antibody against NF200 and had large 
diameter, providing evidences of non-nociceptive population 
among dental primary afferent neurons. These results correlate 
well with our previous report that argued for similar proportion of 
non-nociceptive neurons among dental primary afferents based 
on electrophysiological observation [13].
Large population of small unmyelinated neurons suggests that 
detection of nociceptive signal is an important role of dental 
primary aff erent neurons. Direct detection of nociceptive thermal 
stimuli by dental primary afferent neuron was suggested in our 
previous study by functional expression of temperature sensitive 
TRP channels in dental primary afferent neurons [14]. We have 
also reported expression of other nociceptive-related proteins, 
such as P2X2, P2X3 and NaV1.8 [13]. Together with the results 
from current study, these observations suggest that detection of 
nociceptive stimuli is an important role of nociceptive dental 
primary aff erent neurons. 
It is noteworthy to fi nd that signifi cant subpopulation of dental 
primary afferent neurons showed characteristics of Aβ nerve

possibility. Immunohistochemical analysis detected expression of 
ATF-3 only in 8.7±6.7% (n=16.8±13.0/215.7±93.3) of DiI-labeled 
dental primary afferent neurons (Fig. 4). In contrast, extensive 
expression of ATF-3 was observed in the mandibular region of 
trigeminal ganglion neurons from animals that had received 
transection injury in inferior alveolar nerve (Supplementary Fig. 
1B).

fibers. In contrast to the traditional view that dental primary 
afferent neurons are entirely consist of nociceptors, several 
lines of studies reported non-nociceptive Aβ nerve fibers in 
dental primary afferent neurons based on electron microscopic 
observation [2, 8, 22] and response of human subjects to weak 
electrical stimulation of tooth pulp [2, 7]. Since Aβ nerve fibers 
serve as non-nociceptive low-threshold mechanoreceptors and 
altered central processing of peripheral input from Aβ nerve fi bers 
induces mechanical allodynia [23], it is possible that some of the 
NF200 positive neurons may be mechanosensitive Aβ afferent 
neurons that are responsible for detection of fluid movement 
within dentinal tubules,as proposed in hydrodynamic theory,and 
the altered central processing of information of the dentinal fl uid 
movement might perceived as the dentin hypersensitivity. More 
sophisticated speculation on these Aβ dental primary afferent 
neurons is desirable for understanding of dentin hypersensitivity, 
along with biomechanical investigation on fl uid dynamics within 
the dentinal tubules.
Several literatures suggested that over 60% of axons of inferior 
alveolar nerve neurons were myelinated [24-27], which showed 
discrepancyto our data in whichonly 25.7% were myelinated. In 
addition, more recent study reported that most of parental axons 
traced with horseradish peroxidase placed in upper molars of rats 
were myelinated [28]. Investigation of conduction velocity of pulp 
neurons suggested demyelination of myelinated nerve fi bers upon 
entrance to pulp cavity [29], which was supported by electron 
microscopic investigationwhich observed 33.5% of myelination in 

tooth pulp neurons in contrast to more than 59% of myelination in 
inferior alveolar nerve neurons in rats [25]. However, this might be 
not the case in our experimental setup, since immunofl uorescence 
of NF200 was investigated in the trigeminal ganglion where the 
somas of the pulp neurons were located. One possible explanation 
for this discrepancy is that incidence ofmyelination in electron 
microscopic studies were high because Aβ as well as Aδ fibers 
are detected in electromicroscopic studies, whereas in our 
immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescent intensity of 
NF200 from thinly myelinated Aδ population was too weak to be 
detected as positive¸ and only thickly myelinated Aβ fi ber neurons 
were counted. In line with this, the diameters of NF200 positive 
neurons were distinct fromdiameters of peripherin positive 
neurons, suggesting that detection of small myelinated neurons by 
NF200 was diffi  cult in our experimental setup.
It is possible that placement surgery of retrograde transport 
fl uorescent dye in tooth pulp might cause damage and subsequent 
plastic change to the dental primary afferent neurons. If this is 
the case, the results obtained from the labeled neurons might 
not represent physiologic state. However, limited detection of 
neuronal injury marker ATF3 in retrogradely labeled neurons 
suggests that our surgical protocols did not damage the tooth pulp 
neurons significantly and changes in neurofilaments expression 
was minimal.
In conclusion, while majority of tooth pulp neurons showed 
anatomical and immunohistochemical characteristics of 
nociceptive neurons, significant subpopulation was detected as

non-nociceptive large myelinated neurons, which might serve as 
mechanotransducers that detect movement of dentinal fluid. It 
is possible that altered processing of the information from these 
non-nociceptive large myelinated neuronsmight contribute to 
the generation of dentin hypersensitivity, in which low-threshold 
mechanical stimulation could be perceived as nociception.
