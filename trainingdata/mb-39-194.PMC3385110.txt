Pepper  anthracnose  caused  by  Colletotrichum  species  is  one  of  the  most  important  limiting  factors  for  pepper  production
in  Korea,  its  management  being  strongly  dependent  on  chemicals.  The  aim  of  this  work  was  to  evaluate  the  possibilities
of  using  silver  nanoparticles  instead  of  commercial  fungicides.  In  this  study,  we  evaluated  the  effect  of  silver  nanoparticles
against  pepper  anthracnose  under  different  culture  conditions.  Silver  nanoparticles  (WA-PR-WB13R)  were  applied  at  various
concentrations  to  determine  antifungal  activities  in  vitro  and  in  the  field.  The  application  of  100 ppm  concentration  of  silver
nanoparticles  produced  maximum  inhibition  of  the  growth  of  fungal  hyphae  as  well  as  conidial  germination  in  comparison
to  the  control  in  vitro.  In  field  trials,  the  inhibition  of  fungi  was  significantly  high  when  silver  nanoparticles  were  applied
before  disease  outbreak  on  the  plants.  Scanning  electron  microscopy  results  indicated  that  the  silver  nanoparticles  caused
a  detrimental  effect  on  mycelial  growth  of  Colletotrichum  species.

Anthracnose disease, which is caused by the fungal pathogen
Colletotrichum  is  a  devastating  disease  that  occurs  on
many  commercially  important  plants  like  bean,  strawberry,
perilla  and  other  crop  plants  [1].  In  order  to  control
various  phytopathogenic  fungi,  including  Colletotrichum
species,  agrochemicals  have  been  used  for  a  long  time.
Widespread  use  of  agrochemicals  has  certainly  decreased
the  outbreak  of  fungal  diseases,  but  at  the  same  time  has
contributed  to  the  development  of  resistant  pathogens  [2,
3].  Moreover,  such  chemicals  can  be  lethal  to  beneficial
microorganisms in the rhizosphere and useful soil insects,
and they may also enter the food chain and accumulate in
the  human  body  as  undesirable  chemical  residues  [4].
With  the  emergence  and  increase  of  microbial  organisms
resistant to multiple antibiotics, and the continuing emphasis
on  health-care  costs,  many  researchers  have  tried  to
develop  new  and  effective  antimicrobial  reagents  that  do
not stimulate resistance and are less expensive.

Nanoscale materials have emerged as novel antimicrobial
agents  owing  to  their  high  surface  area  to  volume  ratio
and  the  unique  chemical  and  physical  properties,  which
increases  their  contact  with  microbes  and  their    ability  to
permeate  cells  [5, 6].  Also,  nanotechnology  has  amplified
the effectiveness of silver particles as antimicrobial agents.
Silver  is  known  to  attack  a  broad  range  of  biological

processes  in  microorganisms  including  cell  membrane
structure  and  functions  [7-9].  Silver  also  inhibits  the
expression  of  proteins  associated  with  ATP  production
[10],  although  its  specific  antimicrobial  mechanisms  are
still  not  completely  understood.  The  use  of  nano-sized
silver  particles  as  antimicrobial  agents  has  become  more
common as technological advances make their production
more  economical.  One  of  the  potential  applications  of
silver  is  to  manage  plant  disease.  Since  silver  displays
multiple  modes  of  inhibitory  action  to  microorganisms
[11], it may be used for controlling various plant pathogens
in  a  relatively  safer  way  compared  to  synthetic  fungicides
[12]. Until now, limited research has provided some evidence
of  the  applicability  of  silver  for  controlling  plant  diseases
[11]. Reducing the particle size of materials is an efficient
and  reliable  tool  for  improving  their  biocompatibility.  In
fact,  nanotechnology  helps  in  overcoming  the  limitations
of size and can change the outlook of the world regarding
science [13]. Furthermore, nano-materials can be modified
for better efficiency to facilitate their applications in different
fields  such  as  bioscience  and  medicine.  This  simple  size
comparison  gives  an  idea  of  using  nanoparticles  as  very
small probes that would allow the elucidation of the cellular
machinery  without  introducing  too  much  interference  [14].

level  is  a  strong  driving  force  behind  development  of
nanotechnology [15].

In  this  study,  we  demonstrate  the  inhibition  effects  of
silver  nanoparticles  against  Colletotrichum  species  and
pepper  anthracnose  disease  in  vitro  and  in  field  trial
conditions,  respectively.  In  vitro  studies  deal  with  the
effect  of  silver  nanoparticles  on  Colletotrichum  species
under different concentrations and growth medium as well
as  the  control  mechanism  of  silver  nanoparticles  against
Colletotrichum in field trials.

Materials  and  Methods

Silver  nanoparticles  and  fungicides. Silver  nanoparticle
(WA-PR-WB13R [PR]) was supplied by Bio-Plus Co. Ltd.
(Pohang, Korea) at the initial concentration of 1,000 ppm.
The  colloidal  silver  nanoparticle  solution  was  diluted  to
different  concentrations  of  10 ppm,  30 ppm,  50 ppm,  and
100 ppm using distilled water at room temperature (25oC).
These nanoparticles have colloidal shapes with an average
size of 4~8 nm. All these solutions were stored at 4oC for
further  use.  Distilled  water  was  used  as  control  and  two
different fungicides were used as positive controls: NSS-F
composed  of  nano  silver  and  titanium  (Dongbangagro
Co.,  Seoul,  Korea)  and  Fenari  (Dongbu  HiTek,  Seoul,
Korea).

Fungi  and  growth  media. Six  Colletotrichum  species
were obtained from Korean Agricultural Culture Collection
(KACC),  Suwon,  Korea  (Table  1).  These  fungi  were
grown  on  potato  dextrose  agar  (PDA)  and  incubated  at
28 ± 2oC.  To  differentiate  the  antifungal  activities  of  silver
nanoparticles in culture medium, three different agar media
were used: PDA, malt extract agar (MEA), and corn meal
agar (CMA).

In  vitro  assay.
In  vitro  assay  was  carried  out  on  PDA,
MEA, and CMA treated with 10, 30, 50, and 100 ppm of
WA-PR-WB13R  silver  nanoparticles.  Five  mL  of  WA-
PR-WB13R was poured into the media before plating into
each  90 × 15 mm  Petri  dish.  The  media  containing  silver
nanoparticles was incubated at room temperature. After 48 hr
of  incubation,  an  agar  plug  of  8 mm  diameter  containing
fungi  was inoculated  simultaneously  at the  center of each

Petri  dish  and  incubated  at  28 ± 2oC.  After  2 wk  of
incubation,  inhibition  zones  were  measured.  The  test  was
repeated  twice  and  each  treatment  replicated  three  times.
The  inhibition  rate  (%)  was  calculated  by  using  the
following formula:

Inhibition rate  %(

where R is radial growth of fungi in control plate and r is
the  radial  growth  of  fungi  in  silver  nanoparticle  treated
plates.  Data  from  the  experiments  were  analyzed  by
analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  using  SAS  ver.  9.2  (SAS
Institute  Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA)  and  the  mean  values  were
compared using the Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT)
at p = 0.05.

Field trials and data analysis. To determine the efficacy
of  silver  nanoparticles  against  pepper  anthracnose  in  the
field,  an  experiment  was  carried  out  in  Chuncheon,
Kangwon-do, Korea before and after pepper was naturally
infected. Silver nanoparticles were used at 10, 30, 50, and
100 ppm  simultaneously.  The  silver  nanoparticles  were
applied  on  the  leaves  of  plants 3~4 wk  before the  disease
outbreak,  and  after  the  disease  outbreak.  The  silver
nanoparticles  were  applied  every  week  for  four  wk.
Results  were  obtained  four  wk  after  the  final  treatment
for  the  before-the-disease-outbreak  treatment,  and  one  wk
after  the  final  treatment  for  the  after-the-disease-outbreak
treatment.  The  commercial  fungicide  ‘NSS-F,’  which
contains  nano  silver  and  platinum,  and  the  chemical
fungicide ‘Fenari’ were used as positive controls. Distilled
water  was  used  as  a  negative  control.  Disease  incidence
(%)  was  calculated  by  counting  the  numbers  of  infected
leaves out of 150 leaves among the treated plants in field
trials. Each experiment was repeated three times.

was  incubated  at room temperature. The entire specimens
were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde for 3 hr and treated with
0.1 M  cacodylate  buffer  for  1 hr.  After  washing  with
distilled  water,  the  specimen  was  dehydrated  in  a  graded
ethanol  series  up  to  100%,  critical-point  dried,  and  gold-
coated  using  an  ion  sputter-coater.  The  specimen  was
observed on a SEM (S-3500N; Hitachi Co., Tokyo, Japan)
at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV.

However,  on  CMA  media,  all  the  concentrations  showed
more  than  45%  inhibition  but  the  results  were  not  as
significant as on PDA media. The highest inhibition observed
on  CMA  was  against  C-7  on  100 ppm  concentration  of
silver  nanoparticles  (93.50%)  and  the  lowest  inhibition
was  observed  against  C-8  treated  with  100 ppm  silver
nanoparticles. Therefore, the results showed the inhibition

Results

Inhibition  of  Colletotrichum  species  on  various  culture
media. Six  Colletotrichum  species  were  selected  to
analyze  the  inhibition  effect  of  silver  nanoparticles  WA-
PR-WB13B  on  PDA,  MEA,  and  CMA.  The  fungal
isolates  treated with distilled  water were used  as controls.
Silver nanoparticles showed various levels of inhibition on
mycelial  growth  of  Colletotrichum  species  (Table  2).
Significant  inhibition  in  mycelial  growth  of  Colletotrichum
supplied  with  100 ppm  silver  nanoparticles  on  PDA  was
evident. Complete inhibition was observed on PDA treated
with 100 ppm silver nanoparticles against isolates C-3 and
C-5.  The  C-7  and  C-8  isolates  also  showed  more  than
90%  inhibition  on  PDA  treated  with  100 ppm  silver
nanoparticles.  The  lowest  inhibition  was  observed  against
isolate  C-6  on  PDA.  In  all  10 ppm  silver  nanoparticles
treatments,  the  inhibition  rate  was  lower  as  compared  to
other treatments.

Likewise, the inhibition induced by silver nanoparticles
against  mycelial  growth  of  Colletotrichum  species  was
also observed on MEA media; however the inhibition rate
was  not  significant  as  compared  to  PDA  media.  The
highest  inhibition  rate  was  observed  against  C-6  treated
with  50 ppm  of  silver  nanoparticles  (84.56%)  and  the
treatment  against  C-6  on  30 ppm  silver  nanoparticles  also
showed  significant  inhibition  on  MEA  (84.50%).  The
lowest  inhibition  rate  was  observed  against  C-7  treated
with  10 ppm  of  silver  nanoparticles  on  MEA  (11.33%).

one-wk  interval)  and  the  other  results  were  obtained  4
wk  after  the  last  treatment  for  before-the-disease
outbreak  treatment  (treated  three  times  for  3  wk  at
one-wk  interval).  Commercial  fungicides  NSS-F  and
Fenari  were  used  as  positive  controls.  Distilled  water
was  used  as  a  negative  control.  Data  were  obtained
from triplicate assays and are presented as mean ± SD.

rate  varies  with  the  selection  of  growth  medium  and
concentration  of  silver  nanoparticles.  In  this  experiment,
PDA was the most favorable media for the suppression of
pathogens  in  vitro.  The  results  also  showed  that  the
inhibition rate differs within the species of Colletotrichum
when  used  in  different  growth  media  with  various
concentrations of silver nanoparticles.

Effect  of  silver  nanoparticles  against  anthracnose  in
field  trial. The  inhibition  effect  of  silver  nanoparticles
WA-PR-WB13B  was  analyzed  against  pepper  anthracnose
in  pepper  field  near  Chuncheon,  Korea  (Fig.  1).  The
average disease incidence was maximum (84.1%) in control
plants.  The  results  showed  that,  in  all  treatments,  higher
disease  incidence  was  observed  in  plants  treated  after  the
disease outbreak. Commercial fungicides, NSS-F and Fenari,
showed  35.2%  and  25.3%  disease  incidence,  respectively,
on  plants  treated  before-disease-outbreak.  However,  in
after-disease-outbreak  treatments,  disease  incidence  was
significantly higher as compared to before-disease-outbreak
treatments  with  NSS-F  and  Fenari  (72.1%  and  63.4%
respectively). In all treatments, the lowest disease incidence
was  observed  on  plants  treated  with  50 ppm  silver
nanoparticles  before  the  disease  outbreak  (9.7%),  and  the

highest  disease  incidence  was  observed  on  plants  treated
with NSS-F after the disease outbreak (72.1%). The results
showed  that  silver  nanoparticles  treatment  suppressed
pathogen attack  when applied before  the disease outbreak
on  the  plants.  Also,  the  results  indicated  that  the  silver
nanoparticles  WA-PR-WB13B 
treatments  were  more
effective than commercial fungicides NSS-F and Fenari in
field trials.

SEM  observation  of  C.  gloeosporioides  mycelia.
Different  concentration  of  silver  nanoparticles  and  its
inhibition  of  mycelial  germination  of  C.  gloeosporioides
was analyzed  via  SEM.  In  order  to  elucidate  the  effect  of
silver nanoparticles on fungal growth, healthy fungal hyphae
grown  on  PDA  plates  were  sprayed  with  30,  50,  or
100 ppm  silver  nanoparticle  solution,  and  observed  by
SEM.  This  microscopic  observation  revealed  that  silver
nanoparticles  clearly  damaged  the  hyphae  (Fig.  2B~2D),
while  hyphae  treated  with  water  (control)  appeared  to
remain intact (Fig. 2A). The damage on the hyphae increased
with  the  increment  of  concentration  and  time.  Fungal
mycelia were sunken and damaged due to the effect of silver
nanoparticles (Fig. 2B~2D). The fungal hyphae observed 3
days  after  the  treatment  of  100 ppm  silver  nanoparticles

100 ppm  silver  nanoparticle  solution  (B~D,  respectively).  Photos  were  taken  three  days  after  the  treatment  (scale

showed  deformities  in  mycelial  growth  and  the  shape  of
hyphal  walls.  The  layers  of  hyphal  walls  were  also  tore
off  on  damaged  hyphae  at  3  days  (Fig.  2D)  and  many
hyphae  were collapsed  at  5  days.  Similar  results were also
observed  on  spores  of  C.  gloeosporioides  (not  shown).
Therefore,  the  results  suggested  that  concentration  and
treatment time plays a pivotal role in inhibition of pathogen.

Discussion

The obtained results of the antifungal activity clearly reveal
that  the  growth  of  Colletotrichum  species  including  C.
gloeosporioides  is  inhibited  at  different  concentrations  of
silver  nanoparticles.  Based  on  the  comparison  of  results
obtained  from  before  and  after  the  disease  outbreak
treatments,  the  results  indicate that  the  inhibition  of  fungus
can be achieved when it is applied before disease symptoms
occur  on  plants.  The  highest  antifungal  properties  were
observed  in  the  case  of  treatment  with  50 ppm  silver
nanoparticles in field trials and 100 ppm silver nanoparticles
in  vitro.  Therefore,  the  results  clearly  demonstrate  that  the
silver nanoparticles have the potential to inhibit species of
the  fungal  pathogen  Colletotrichum  in  field  conditions  as
well as in a controlled environment.

Nanometer-sized  silvers  possess  different  properties,
which  might  come  from  morphological,  structural,  and
physiological changes [16]. Indeed, several lines of evidence
support the enhanced efficiency of silver nanoparticles on
antimicrobial activity. Silver nanoparticles are highly reactive
as they generate Ag+ ions while metallic silver is relatively
unreactive  [5].  It  was  also  shown  that  the  nanoparticles
efficiently  penetrate  into  microbial  cells,  which  implies
lower concentrations of nano-sized silver would be sufficient
for  microbial  control.  This  would  be  efficient,  especially
for  some  organisms  that  are  less  sensitive  to  antibiotics
due  to  the  poor  penetration  of  some  antibiotics  into  cells
[17].  A  previous  study  observed  that  silver  nanoparticles
disrupt  transport  systems  including  ion  efflux  [5].  The
dysfunction  of  ion  efflux  can  cause  rapid  accumulation of
silver  ions,  interrupting  cellular  processes  at  their  lower
concentrations  such  as  metabolism  and  respiration  by
reacting  with  molecules.  Also,  silver  ions  are  known  to
produce  reactive  oxygen  species  via  their  reaction  with
oxygen,  which  is  detrimental  to  cells,  causing  damage  to
proteins,  lipids,  and  nucleic  acids  [18, 19].  Meanwhile,  a
previous  study  suggested  that  silver  nanoparticles  can
significantly  delay  mycelial  growth  of  C.  gloeosporioides
in  a  dose-dependent  manner  in  vitro  [20].  However,  in
this  study  we  focused  on  the  inhibition  effect  of  silver
nanoparticles  against  six  Colletotrichum  species  on  three
different  growth  media  in  vitro  as  well  as  in  field  trials.
Our previous studies also suggested that the application of
silver nanoparticles is effective against sclerotium forming
fungi,  powdery  mildews,  and  Raffaelea  sp.  [21-24].

Similarly,  the  present  study  also  suggests  that  silver
nanoparticles  are  effective  for  the  control  of  pepper
anthracnose  pathogen  Colletotrichum  species  including
C.  gloeosporioides.  Thus,  silver  nanoparticles  prepared
by  a  cost  effective  method  have  great  promise  as  an
antimicrobial  agent,  and  the  antifungal  activity  of  silver
nanoparticles  has  a  great  potential  for  use  in  controlling
spore-producing  fungal  plant  pathogens.  The  field  study
also  suggests  that,  since  the  efficacy  of  silver  is  greatly
influenced  by  application  time,  preventative  applications
of    silver  nanoparticles  work  better  before  fungal  isolates
penetrate and colonize within the plant tissue.

In summary, application of silver nanoparticles may lead
to  valuable  discoveries  in  various  fields  such  as  pathogen
control and antimicrobial systems. However, with the advent
of silver nanoparticles and its major use as an antimicrobial
agent,  much  experimental  trials  are  needed  to  understand
the toxicity. There are some questions still remaining  to  be
addressed,  such  as  the  exact  mechanism  of  interaction  of
silver  nanoparticles  with  fungal  cells  and  how  the  surface
area of nanoparticles influences killing activity. Also animal
models  and  clinical  studies  will  need  to  be  performed  to
get  a  better  understanding  of  the  antifungal  efficiency  of
silver nanoparticles.
