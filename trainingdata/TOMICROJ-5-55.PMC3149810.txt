Abstract: Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strains cause different types of systemic extraintestinal infections in 
poultry,  collectively termed  colibacillosis, which  can  cause  significant  economic  losses  in the poultry industry. To date, 
there  have  been  no  descriptions  of  genes  or  characteristics  that  allow  for  the  classification  of  avian  strains  pathotypes  
responsible  for  causing  specific  diseases  in  their  hosts.  In  this  study  we  aimed  to  characterize  avian  E.  coli  strains  
representing 4 groups, including one of commensal strains (AFEC – Avian Fecal Escherichia coli) and 3 groups of APEC 
strains,  where  each  group  is  responsible  for  causing  a  different  disease  syndrome  in  their  respective  hosts  (septicemia, 
omphalitis and swollen head syndrome). We chose to examine several biological characteristics of these strains including: 
adhesion  to  eukaryotic  cells,  pathogenicity  levels  according  to  the  lethal  dose  (50%)  assay,  phylogenetic  group  and  
virulence  gene  profiles.  The  comparison  of  strains  based  on  these  genotypic  and  phenotypic  traits,  using  multivariate  
statisticals  tools  and  complex  networks,  allowed  us  to  infer  information  about  the  population  structure  of  the  studied 
groups. Our results indicate that APEC strains do not constitute a unique homogeneous group, but rather a structured set 
of  subgroups,  where  each  one  is  associated  with  a  specific  infectious  syndrome  which  can  possibly  be  used  to  define 
pathotypes  or  subpathotypes  within  APEC  strains.  These  results  offer  new  possibilities  with  which  to  study  the  genes  
responsible  for  various  pathogenetic  processes  within  APEC  strains,  and  for  vaccine  development.  It  may  be  important  
to  consider  these  subgroups  when  developing  a  vaccine  in  an  effort  for  obtain  cross  protection,  which  has  not  yet  been 
successfully accomplished when working with APEC strains. 

Keywords: Escherichia coli, APEC, pathotype, network analysis. 

INTRODUCTION 

  Escherichia coli are probably one of the most ubiquitous 
microorganisms on Earth, existing as part of the  commensal 
intestinal  flora,  where  it  is  responsible  for  the  production  of 
many  beneficial  metabolic  products.  It  is  also  capable  of 
causing  different  disease  syndromes  in  animal  and  human 
hosts  [1].  Avian  pathogenic  Escherichia  coli  (APEC)  [2] 
strains cause many different types of extraintestinal systemic

infections in poultry, which are collectively termed colibacil-
losis  [3].  These  diseases,  including  septicemia,  omphalitis, 
cellulitis, yolk-sac infection and swollen head syndrome, are 
responsible  for  high  morbidity,  mortality  and  carcass  con-
demnation,  all  of  which  cause  significant  annual  economic 
losses  within  the  avian  industry  [3].  For  many  years  it  has 
been  widely  accepted  that  APEC  strains  are  opportunistic 
pathogens  [4].  Recent  studies,  however,  have  revealed  sig-
nificant  differences  in  the  distribution  of  virulence  factors 
among  APEC  strains  and  avian  fecal  commensal  E.  coli 
(AFEC)  strains,  suggesting  that  APEC  strains  are  well 
adapted  to  a  pathogenic  lifestyle  [5,  6].  It  is  reasonable  to 
expect that APEC would utilize virulence  mechanisms simi-
lar to that of other extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)

[7] strains, such as uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) and neona-
tal  meningitis  E.  coli  (NMEC),  both  human  diseases,  be-
cause  they  are  capable  of  causing  disease  in  similar  envi-
ronments.  A  comparative  analysis  of  the  first  complete 
APEC  genome  sequence  [8]  and  genomes  from  various  Ex-
PEC  subpathotypes  [5]  have  revealed  strong  similarity  be-
tween  these  strains  of  E.  coli.  If  all  APEC  strains  cause  a 
common  disease  in  poultry  with  a  common  set  of  virulence 
factors  they  may  constitute  a  specific  pathotype  [1,  6].  We 
hypothesize  that  APEC  strains  like  human  ExPEC  strains, 
which encompasses  the UPEC  and NMEC  strains  that  cause 
distinct  syndromes,  may  harbor  subtypes  with  unique  geno-
types  that  cause  distinct  disease  syndromes  in  poultry.  To 
our knowledge, no effort has been made  to determine if dis-
tinct subpathotypes of APEC strains exist, or if specific traits 
determine  the  root  causes  of  pathogenesis  in  these  distinct 
syndromes.  APEC  pathogenesis  is  still  poorly  understood  in 
general, when compared to that of human pathogenic E. coli 
[4,  6].  Despite  recent  advances  in  our  understanding  of 
APEC  pathotypes,  a  method  that  allows  for  the  differentia-
tion  of  APEC  from  AFEC  has  not  yet  been  developed,  par-
tially due to the diversity of APEC populations [5, 6] and the 
likelihood that some are commensal strains with known viru-
lence characteristics. In this study, we investigated the possi-
bility  that  if  APEC  strains  isolated  from  poultry  showing 
specific disease symptom, such as septicemia (S), omphalitis 
(O), and swollen head syndrome (H), are actually member of 
distinct  subpathotypes,  which  possess  different  virulence 
traits  and  capacities  to  cause  disease.  For  the  purposes  of 
comparison,  AFEC  strains  (N),  isolated  from  the  cloaca  of 
presumably healthy chickens were also studied. For  the first 
time  our  results  indicate,  that  at  least  some  of  these  strains 
can  potentially  be  grouped  into  subpathotypes  responsible 
for specific infectious dieases in poultry.  

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Bacterial Strains 

  Escherichia  coli  strains  were  isolated  from  commercial 
adult chickens from different regions of the São Paulo  State 
in  Brazil,  which had  clinical signs of septicemia (S: n  = 24) 
and  swollen  head  syndrome  (H:  n  =  14),  as  well  as  being 
from one-day-old chicks with omphalitis (O: n = 11). Thirty 
AFEC  strains  (N)  were  isolated  with  cloacal  swabs  from 
chickens  with  no  signs  of  illness.  All  strains  belong  to  the 
Microbial  Molecular  Biology  Laboratory  of  the  Department 
of  Genetics,  Evolution  and  Bioagents,  at  Campinas  State 
University  (UNICAMP).  The  strains  from  septicemic  cases 
were  isolated  from  the  liver,  air  sacs  and  lungs.  Strains  that 
caused  Swollen  Head  Syndrome  were  isolated  from  the  in-
fraorbital  sinuses  of  affected  birds,  and  strains  that  caused 
omphalitis  were  isolated  from  the  yolk  sacs  of  one-day-old 
chicks.  MacConkey  agar  medium  was  used  for  the  primary 
isolation  of  these  strains  and  further  confirmation  that  these 
strains were E. coli was accomplished using the Enterobacte-
ria  test  kit  from  Laborclin.  For  routine  tests,  Luria  Bertani 
broth  (LB),  or  agar  (LBA)  [8],  was  used.  All  isolates  were 
stored at -70 °C in LB containing 30% glycerol. 

DNA Extraction 

  DNA  extraction  was  performed  with  the  Wizard  Ge-
nomic  DNA  Purification  Kit  (Promega,  EUA),  according  to 

Maturana et al. 

manufacturer's  instructions.  To  confirm  the  presence  of  
a  number  of  plasmids,  the  alkaline  extraction  technique  
described previously by Sambrook et al. [8] was used. 

Detection of Virulence Genes 

  Virulence  genes  were  detected  using  Polymerase  Chain 
Reaction  (PCR),  following  protocols  described  elsewhere 
(Table 1). 

Phylogenetic Analysis 

 
Isolates  were  assigned  to  phylogenetic  groups  according 
to the method of Clermont et al. [9]. In this method, isolates 
are  assigned  to  one  of  four  groups  (A,  B1,  B2,  or  D)  based 
on the presence of two genes (chuA and yjaA) and a specific 
DNA fragment (TSPE4.C2). 

Adhesion to Tracheal Epithelial Cells 

  The  ability  to  adhere  to  tracheal  epithelial  cells  was  de-
termined  as  described  by  Dho-Moulin  and  Lafont  [10]. 
Briefly,  tracheas  were  aseptically  removed  from  18-day-old 
specific-pathogen-free,  embryonated  eggs,  rinsed  in  phos-
phate  buffered  saline  (PBS,  pH  7.4)  and  cut  in  5-mm  sec-
tions.  Adherence  studies  were  performed  in  96-well-round-
bottom  microtiter  plates  containing  two  tracheal  rings,  25 
mL  of  Eagle’s  medium  with  5%  calf  serum,  and  a  bacterial 
suspension  (109  cells/mL)  which  was  previously  grown  in 
LB  (37°C,  18  h).  The  plates  were  incubated  at  37°C  for  30 
min  and  were  washed  twice  with  PBS.  Fresh  Eagle’s  me-
dium  was  then  added,  and  the  plates  were  incubated  for  4 h 
at  37°C.  After  incubation  the  tracheal  sections  were  rinsed 
with  0.1M  PBS  containing  10%  formalin.  The  trachea  rings 
were dehydrated, treated with xyline and embedded in paraf-
fin.  Five-micrometer  sections  were  removed  using  a  micro-
tome,  mounted  on  glass  slides,  hydrated  and  stained  with 
Giemsa  stain.  The  adherence  assays  were  performed  in  the 
presence and in the absence of 1% D-mannose. 

Adhesion to Epithelial Cells Cultured In Vitro 

  The  ability of strains  to  adhere to HEp-2 and HeLa  cells 
was  determined  according  to  a  technique  described  previ-
ously  by  Scaletsky  et  al.  [11],  with  slight  modifications.  
Cultures  of  HEp-2  and  HeLa  cells  were  grown  in  24-well 
tissue  culture  microplates  (BD  Falcon,  Bedford,  MA,  USA) 
into  which  sterile  round  cover  slips  (13mm  in  diameter)  
had  been  placed  prior  to  inoculation  with  the  cells.  The 
growth  medium  in  each  well  of  the  microplate  consisted  
of  0.9mL  of  Eagle’s  minimal  essential  medium  (MEM)  
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, either with or with-
out 1% D-Mannose, and an 1% antibiotic solution (penicillin 
100,000  U  and  streptomycin  100  μg/ml).  Microplates  
were  incubated  in  10%  CO2  at  37°C  until  a  semi-confluent 
monolayer  was  formed.  Afterwards,  the  monolayers  were 
washed 3 times with sterile PBS (0.05M; pH 7.2) and 0.1mL 
aliquots  of  bacterial  test  cultures  [(grown  for  18  h  at  37oC, 
and  diluted  1:10  in  PBS  (approximately  107  CFU)]  were 
added  to  the  wells.  After  3  h  of  incubation  at  37°C,  mono-
layers  were  washed  10  times  with  PBS  buffer,  fixed  with 
methanol  for  10  min,  stained  with  the  May-Grunwald  and 
Giemsa  stains,  and  observed  under  bright  field  microscopy 
(1000x magnification).

Fifty % Lethal Dose (LD50) Assay 

 
Pathogenicity  tests  for  all  strains  were  carried  out  as  de-
scribed  by  Silveira et  al.  [12].  Briefly,  0.5  mL  from  various 
10-fold  dilutions  of  bacterial  culture;  grown  overnight  at 
37°C in LB medium, followed by 1:100 dilution in the same 
medium and growth at 37°C for 4 h, with shaking at 150 rpm; 
were injected subcutaneously into the neck of groups six one-
day-old  male  chicks.  At  the  same  time,  these  dilutions  were 
plated  on  LBA  to  determine  the  number  of  colony  forming 
units  (CFU)  present  in  each  injection.  Controls  chicks  were 
injected  with  LB  medium.  The  injected  groups  and  controls 
were observed for 7 days and the LD50 was calculated by the 
method described by Reed and Muench [13]. Bacterial strains 
were grouped into three categories, accordingly to 50% Lethal 
Dose value: LD50>1010, 109 > LD50< 107 and 106 > LD50< 105. 

Statistical Analysis  

  To analyse binary variables,  all data were organized in  a 
binary  incidence  matrix,  wich  indicated  the  presence  or  ab-
sence  of  the  traits  tested  in  each  isolate  examined.  These 
traits included the 13 virulence genes, fimA, papA, crl, csgA, 
tsh,  lpfAO141,  lpfAO154,  iha,  fyuA,  irp-2,  iucA,  fepC,  sitA; 
and 11 phenotypic characteristics. The phenotypic character-
istics included the following adhesion properties: adhesion to 
the trachea in the presence (TraqM) or absence (TraqNM) of 
D-mannose; adhesion to HeLa cells in the presence (HeLaM) 
and  absence  (HeLaNM)  of  D-  mannose,  and  adhesion  to 
HEp-2  cells  in  the  presence  (HEp-2M)  and  absence  (HEp-
2NM)  of  D-  mannose.  Phylogenetic  groups  were  also  in-
cluded  in  the  matrix  as  phenotypic  traits.  Phylogenetic 
groups B2 and D were considered a single category (B2+D), 
because  virulent  extra-intestinal  strains  mainly  belonged  to 
groups B2 and D. Groups A and B1 were considered a sepa-
rate  category  (A+B1)  [9].  Additionally,  three  categories  of 

50% Lethal Dose characteristics, LD50>1010, 109 > LD50< 107 
and  106  >  LD50<  105  were  included  in  the  matrix  as  pheno-
typic  data.  The  frequencies  of  these  traits  were  compared 
among the groups (N, S, H and O) using the G-test. 

  The structure of the data was visualized by a  Correspon-
dence  Analysis  (CA),  performed  with  the  frequency  matrix 
for  the  presence  or  absence  of  the  genes  and  phenotypic 
characteristics  in  each  group  (N,  S,  H  and  O).  CA  is  an  ex-
ploratory  technique,  which  allowed  us  to  bidimensionally 
visualize  the  structure  of  categorical  variables  on  Chi-
squared  values.  To  accomplish  this,  the  total  variance  (total 
inertia)  of  the  data  is  decomposed  arriving  at  a  lower-
dimensional  representation  of  the  variables  that  allows  for 
the  reconstruction  of  most  of  the  variance  matrix  variables. 
The  distance  between  the  points  in  the  bidimensional  repre-
sentation  indicates  the  association  between  them,  the  closer 
they are, the most associated they are with each one [14]. 

 
Principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  is  a  factor  analysis 
that reduces the number of variables and  classifies variables 
according  to  their  relationship.  PCA  uses  an  orthogonal 
transformation  to  convert  a  set  of  possibly  correlated  vari-
ables  into  a  set of values with uncorrelated variables known 
as  principal  components.  In  this  manner,  PCA  is  commonly 
used to make predictive models which are useful for classifi-
cation  of  variables  [14].  A  PCA  model  was  constucted  to 
obtain  the  best  separation  among  the  groups,  using  all  24 
binary variables. 

  K-means  is  a  clustering  tool  that  produces  different  k 
clusters of the greatest possible distinction. The best number 
of clusters k that lead to the greatest separation is not known 
as  a  priori,  and  must  be  computed  from  the  data  [14].  The 
algorithm  K-means  was  used  to  verify  the  clustering  of  the 
79  strains  according  the  traits  analyzed.  K-means  was  per-
formed for 2 and 3 clusters using all of the binary variables.  

58    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 

  Discriminant function analysis (DA) is used to determine 
what  variables  can  be  used  to  differentiate  between  two  or 
more  groups,  and  is  determinated  a  priori  [14].  A  DA  was 
performed  to  determine  what  variables  discriminate  among 
the groups N, S, H and O, among clusters 1, 2 and 3 obtained 
by the K-means algorithm, as well as between the APEC and 
AFEC  groups.  All  the  statistical  analyses  were  performed 
using STATISCA 6.0 (Statsoft). 

Complex Network 

In this network, there are two sets of nodes: one is repre-
 
senting the samples and another representing the traits. Each 
node  representing  a  sample  is  connected  to  all  nodes  that 
represent  the  traits  specific  to  it.  We  used  an  approach  de-
rived  from  the  physics  of  complex  networks  to  identify  the 
modules  in  the  network.  This  module  identification  algo-
rithm  searches  for  partitions  in  the  empirical  network,  in 
which  modules  maximize  a  modularity  function  [15].  This 
function  accounts  for  the  difference  between  the  fraction  of 
links  inside  each  module,  and  the  fraction  of  links  that  are 
expected to be assoicated with the modules based on chance 
[16].  The  algorithm  uses  the  simulated  annealing  (SA) 
method, a stochastic optimization technique that retrieves the 
lowest cost partition, and thus the optimal configuration [17]. 
Many  methods  are  available  for  cluster  identification,  such 
as  hierarchical  clustering  or  principal  component  analysis; 
however,  this  maximization  algorithm  provides  a  single  
solution  with  well-defined  boundaries  that  can  be  used  
to  separate  groups  [16].  The  SA  algorithm  also  calculates  
the  significance  of  the  modularity  degree  by  comparing  it 
with that of similarly-sized random networks. The SA analy-

Maturana et al. 

sis was run using 100 random networks to  examine whether 
the  empirical  network  was  significantly  more  modular  
than  the  random  ones.  The  number  of  fixed  randomizations 
was  low  because  the  simulated  annealing  algorithm  is  time-
consuming,  and  100  randomizations  were  enough  to  yield 
small confidence intervals (average SD < 0.01). 

RESULTS 

  AFEC  and  APEC  strains  responsible  for  different  syn-
dromes were compared on a genetic basis using the presence 
of  the  genes  fimA,  papA,  crlA,  csgA,  tsh,  lpfAO141, 
lpfAO154, iha, fyuA, irp-2, iucA, fepC, and sitA as variables. 
Phenotypic characteristics were also used to Campare AFEC 
and  APEC  strains  including  the  ability  to  adhere  to  tracheal 
epithelial cells in presence (TraqM) or absence (TraqNM) of 
D-mannose,  the  ability  to  adhere  to  HeLa  cells  cultured  in 
vitro in  the  presence  (HeLaM)  or  in  the  absence  (HeLaNM) 
of  D-mannose,  and  the  ability  to  adhere  to  HEp2  cells  cul-
tured  in  vitro  in  the  presence  (HEp2M)  or  in  the  absence 
(HEp2NM)  of  D-mannose.  Phenotypic  characteristics  were 
also  considered  if  they  were  assigned  to  a  particular  patho-
genic  phylogenetic  type,  (A+B1  and  B2+D),  and  where 
shown  in  the  thress  categories  of  pathogenicity  levels  ac-
cording to  the LD50 assay  as strains of high virulence (106 > 
LD50<  105),  strains  of  intermediate  virulence  (109  >  LD50< 
107)  and  strains  of  low  virulence  (LD50>1010).  The  results, 
per  group  (N,  S,  H  and  O),  including  the  presence  of  viru-
lence  genes,  adhesion  assays,  pathogenic-phylogenetic 
grouping  and  the  50%  lethal  dose  assay  are  shown,  respec-
tively, in Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5.

Statistical Analysis  

  According  to  the  G-Test,  the  groups  N,  S,  H  and  O  are 
different in regard to the distribution of the analyzed charac-
teristics.  The  G-test  value  was  211.3361  with  63  d.f.  and  a 
p<0.001. 

  A bidimensional plot in Fig. (1) represents the results for 
the Correspondence Analysis (CA).  

  The horizontal axis represents 65.54% of the total inertia 
and, the vertical axis is representative of 18.16%. Therefore, 
the  horizontal  axis  is  more  representative  of  original  data,

and  the  distances  between  variables  in  this  dimension  are 
more  informative.  The  total  Chi-squared  value  was  209.137 
(d.f.  =  75,  p<0.001),  and  the  total  Inertia  was  0.30112.  Ac-
cording  to  this  analysis,  similar  traits  were  distributed  be-
tween N and O samples, and traits were more dissimilar be-
tween  H  and  N,  when  compared  to  results  obtained  from 
other comparisons. 

  The bidimensional plot of the PCA data is shown in Fig. (2).  

  The  PCA  model  contained  22  individual  factors.  Factor 
1,  corresponding  to  the  horizontal  axis  was  responsible  for 
21.99%  of  the  total  inertia,  and  separated  the  swollen  head 
syndrome-causing  strains  (H)  from  AFEC  strains  and  om-
phalitis-causing  strains  (N  and  O),  as  shown  in  Fig.  (2). 
Phylogenetic  type  and  LD50  (both  related  to  pathogenicity) 
were the most important traits in this factor comparison; they 
are  the  principal  traits  responsible  for  separating  group  H 
from groups N and O. Factor 2, corresponding to the vertical 
axis,  encompassed  11.49%  of  the  total  inertia  and  separated 
the  AFEC  strains  from  the  O  strains.  The  adhesion  assays 
were  the most  important traits in this factor comparison, be-
cause they were the major traits separating the AFEC and O 
strains. 

  The  composition  of  the  two  clusters  as  calculated  with 
the  K-means  algorithm,  including  all  variables  is  presented 

Maturana et al. 

in  Table  6.  The  characteristics  that  had  higher  variability 
between  groups  (higher  than  the  variance  within  the  group) 
were  LD50  >1010  and  109  >  LD50  <  107.  The  composition  of 
the three clusters obtained using the K-means algorithm with 
all variables is also presented in Table 6. The variables with 
the  highest  between-group  variance  (greater  than  the  vari-
ance  within  an  individual  group)  were  LD50  >1010,  109  > 
LD50  <  107  and  HEp-2  SM.  These  data  corroborate  the  re-
sults  obtained  by  PCA,  and  indicate  that  the  pathogenicity 
and adhesion profiles are the major factor shaping the struc-
ture of this population. 

  The  separation  of  the  three  clusters  obtained  by  the  K-
means  algorithm  appeared  to  be  the  best  way  to  look  at  the 
samples  and  data  studied,  because  it  was  capable  of  distin-
guishing  betwenn  the  H,  O  and  N  strains.  Cluster  1,  which 
was made up almost entirely of AFEC strains (N), was char-
acterized  by  low  pathogenicity,  low  prevalence  of  virulence 
factors,  a  predominance  of  phylogenetic  groups  A  and  B1, 
and many strains with adhesion capacity, especially to HEp-
2  cells.  Cluster  2,  which  was  mostly  comprised  of  strains 
causing  swollen  head  syndrome  (H),  was  characterized  by 
intermediate  pathogenicity,  a  high  frequency  of  virulence 
factors, the predominance of phylogenetic groups B2 and D, 
many  strains  with  general  adhesion  capacity,  especially  to 
HeLa cells in the absence of mannose. Cluster 3 was mostly

comprised  of  omphalitis  strains  (O),  and  was  characterized 
by  low  pathogenicity,  a  low  frequency  of  virulence  factors 
(with  the  exception  of  the  lpfAO154  gene),  a  predominance 
of phylogenetic groups A and B1, a few strains with general 
adhesion  capacity  and  the  complete  absence  of  adhesion  to 
HEp-2 cells in the presence of mannose. 

  The  DA,  using  all  variables  that  allowed  the  discrimina-
tion of isolates from the N, S, H and O groups had a correct 
assignment rate of 89.87% (Table 7).  

  The  variables  used  in  the  DA  model  to  separate  the  iso-
lates based on the characteristics of groups AFEC and APEC 
(formed  by  S,  H  and  O  strains)  were  csgA,  lpfAO154,  crl, 
sitA  and  fimA  genes,  groups  A+B1,,  HeLa  CM,  HEp-2  SM, 
TraqCM,  LD50%>1010  and  106>LD50%<105  (Wilks'  Lambda: 
0.23952,  F  (11,67)  =  19.338  p<  0.00001).  These  variables 
were used to correctly classify 96% of the isolates (Table 8). 

 
Since  the  diversity  was  higher  between  isolates  from 
group  S,  they  were  often  incorrectly  assigned  (Table  4).  A 
PCA was also performed using only isolates from groups N, 
H and O (Fig. 3).  

Network Analysis 

  The  modularity  index  M  was  significantly  higher  than 
that of similarly-sized random networks (P < 0.001). The SA 
algorithm  identified  three  modules  of  similar  size  (Fig.  4). 
The  first  module,  MI,  was  composed  primarily  of  AFEC 
isolates.  The second module,  MII,  contained more  than 60% 
of  the  total  omphalitis  isolates,  and  septicemia  isolates,  but 
less  than  40%  of  the  total  swollen  head  syndrome  isolates, 
and just one AFEC  isolate.The last module,  MIII, was  com-
posed of many septicemic isolates, and more than 60% of the 
total swollen head syndrome isolates. 

DISCUSSION 

 
In this study, we  aimed  to test  the hypothesis that APEC 
strains,  isolated  as  causative  agents  of  various  syndromes, 

harbor  different  capacities  to  cause  disease  and  can  be 
grouped  into  distinct  subpathotypes.  We  hypothesized  that 
these  isolates  could  be  distinguished  from  one  another  by 
certain  genotypic  and  phenotypic  traits.  The  possibility  that 
APEC  strains  could  be  categorized  into  subgroups  has  been 
suggested  in  previous  studies  [e.g.,  18;6],  based  on  data  ob-
tained  by  virulence  factor-genotyping,  but  the  relationship 
between  these subgroups and  the various disease syndromes 
caused by APEC strains has remained understudied.  

  Our  results  suggest  such  a  relationship  exists,  and  we 
have revealed the existence of at  least two subgroups within 
APEC  strains:  one  composed  mainly  of  strains  that  cause 
swollen  head  syndrome  and  another  composed  mainly  of 
strains  that  cause  omphalitis.  The  septicemic  strains  appear 
to be dispersed and between these groups. These results also 
suggest  that  the  difficulty  in  establishing  an  exact  method 
with  which  to  distinguish  the  AFEC  and  APEC  strains  may 
be  partially  due  to  the  existence  of  structured  subgroups 
within the APEC strains, including some of the more similar 
AFEC strains, such as the omphalitis-related strains. Thus, a 
resolution  that  allows  differentiation  between  the  extreme 
groups (groups more dissimilar from the AFEC strains, such 
as  the  strains  that  cause  Swollen  Head  Syndrome)  and  the 
AFEC  strains  does  not  allow  differentiation  between  more 
similar  groups  (again  compared  to  AFEC  strains),  such  as 
the  omphalitis-causing  and  AFEC  strains.  Consequently, 
some  APEC  strains  may  be  incorrectly  classified  as  AFEC 
strains,  and vice-versa  [5,  6],  whenever  a  unique  cut-off  pa-
rameter is established for differentiation, except if the factors 
involved  in  APEC  pathogenesis  are  fully  distinct,  and  used 
to develop cut-off parameters.  

  Other published data corroborate our studies.  Rodriguez-
Siek et al. [6] found a significant difference in the distribution 
of  genes  associated  with  virulence  between  strains  causing 
septicemia and cellulitis, which suggests the presence of two 
distinct  strains,  each  associated  with  a  specific  disease.

suggested  that  the  strains  associated  with  septicemia  have 
acquired  a  larger  array  of  virulence  factors.  It  therefore  
appears  that  differences  among  strains  that  cause  different 
disease  exist,  and  these  differences  include  variation  in  the 
number  of  virulence  genes  and  phenotypic  traits,  such  as 
adhesion and lethality, as demonstrated in this work. 

  The strains that cause septicemia, which do not constitute 
a specific group, overlap with the H and O isolates, and only 
slightly with the AFEC strains, which is consistent with there 
being  a  distinct  difference  between  the  AFEC  and  APEC 
strains  [5].  This  evidence  also  corroborates  the  theory  that 
APEC  strains  are  well  equipped  for  a  pathogenic  lifestyle, 
and  are  not  simply  opportunistic  pathogens  [5].  Besides  be-
ing important to our understanding of the APEC pathotypes, 
the  dispersal  of  strains  causing  septicemia  within  other 
groups  is  important,  because  septicemic  strains  are  often 
chosen as ‘model’ strains in APEC studies that aim to better 
define  the  pathogenic  mechanisms  used  by  APEC  to  cause 
colibacillosis.  The  apparent  diversity  of  strains  that  cause 
septicemia  may  reflect  a  failure  to  identify  a  specific  set  
of  virulence  factors  among  these  strains.  If  there  is  a  yet  
unknown  set  of  properties  that  would  allow  for  the  better 
characterization  of  septicemic  strains,  its  discovery  may  
allow for this distinction in the future  

  Alternatively,  it  may  be  that  septicemia  is  a  result  of  
the  progression  of  primary  omphalitis  or  swollen  head  
syndrome.  If  these  were  the  case,  septicemic  strains  would 
not  be  expected  to  form  a  unique  homogenous  group,  
but  would  be  comprised  of  a  heterogenous  mix  of  strains, 
varying  in  genotype  and  the  number  of  virulence  factors,  as 
well as their capacity to cause disease and colonize different 
tissues.  In  humans,  more  than  one  subpathotype  of  ExPEC, 
including strains of UPEC and NMEC, can cause septicemia 
[7].  

  The multivariate statistical analyses used in this study did 
not  determine  the  number  of  groups  within  the  population, 

Subpathotypes of Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC)

which was deduced by data  interpretation, based on samples 
similarities.  However, 
the  complex  network  analysis  
revealed  a  structure  based  on  three  modules,  indicating  that 
the  APEC  population  is  structured,  since  one  module  is  
comprised  almost  entirely  of  AFEC  strains.  If  this  was  
not the case, only two modules would appear in the network, 
one  comprise  of  the  AFEC  strains,  ant  the  other  comprised 
of  the  APEC  strains.  The  appearance  of  three  modules,  
one  comprised  of  the  AFEC  strains  and  two  other  of  the 
APEC strains, indicates  that there  are at  least two structured 
APEC groups. Our data suggest that one group represents the 
APEC  strains  that  cause  swollen  head  syndrome;  the  other 
represents  the  strains  that  cause  omphalitis.  The  strains  that 
cause septicemia are distributed between the two groups.  

  The  apparent  differences  between  the  results  obtained 
from the  multivariate statistical analyses, and  the results ob-
tained from the complex network analysis, may be explained 
by  the  fact  that  the  network  links  each  strain  to  a  module. 
Therefore,  differences  between  strains  linked  to  the  same 
module  may  not  necessarily  be  apparent,  and  can  become 
understated.  The  multivariate  statistical  analyses,  which  did 
not  reveal  the  presence  of  distinct  groups,  allowed  us  to 
visualize  that  strains  causing  omphalitis  are  more  geneticall 
and  phenotypically  related  to  strains  than  strains  that  cause 
swollen head syndrome. 

  As  revealed  by  PCA,  the  phylogenetic  groups  and  DL50 
(both of which are related to pathogenicity) are the most im-
portant  traits  responsible  for  separating  strains  that  cause 
swollen head syndrome (H) from AFEC strains and omphali-
tis-causing  strains  (N  and  O).  These  findings  suggest  that  H 
strains  are  more  pathogenic  and  that  they  have  “aggressive” 
characteristics,  including  high  lethality,  the  presence  of  
virulence  genes  and  a  general  ability  to  adhere  to  different 
cell types.  

  Additionally, it is important to note that the traits primar-
ily responsible for the grouping of AFEC strains and ompha-
litis-causing  strains  were  that  of  lethal  dose  categories  and 
phylogenetic  groups.  The  specific  characteristics  that  distin-
guished  them  were  the  performance  in  adhesion  assays  and 
lpfAO154 gene. Thus, omphalitis-causing strains  may be not 
opportunistic  pathogens,  but  isolates  of  low  pathogenicity 
that  are  particularly  well  adapted  to  a  specific  niche,  result-
ing in their similarities to AFEC strains, but with a different 
adhesion profile. This observation  is consistent with the fact 
that  these  strains  may  have  a  particular  infection  pathway, 
causing direct transmission from the cloacae through the egg 
shell. 

  Our  results  corroborate  those  of  Johnson  et  al.  [5]  who 
found  that  APEC  strains  were  not  homogeneous,  and  could 
be  assigned  to  subgroups  based  on  differences  in  virulence 
gene distribution. In their work, strains were not analyzed by 
the  disease  they  caused,  or  by  the  site  of  origin.  However, 
they  detected  two  groups,  one  harboring  strains  with  low 
pathogenicity  that had few known virluence factors,  and an-
other  harboring  strains  with  high  pathogenicity  that  had  a 
high number of known virulence genes. Interestingly, in that 
study,  many  APEC  strains  were  misclassified  as  AFEC 
strains  because  they  possessed  a  low  number  of  virulence 
genes,  prompting  the  authors  to  suggest  that  these  were  op-
portunistic pathogens. It is possible to hypothesize that  such 

characterization  reflects  the  population  structure  observed 
here, with these differences reflecting their virulence profiles 
based on the syndrome they cause.  

  Our  results  enhance  the  premise  that  avian  hosts,  in  the 
same  manner  as  their  human  counterparts,  are  biologically 
complex  and  provide  different  niches  for  pathogens  to 
occupy.  Because  there  are  many  pathotypes  of  E.  coli 
associated  with  disease  in  humans  [1],  the  same  would  be 
expected for avian pathogenic strains.  

  The  work  reported  here  has  examined  Brazilian  APEC 
strains, but future work is required to determine if our obser-
vations can be repeated when analyzing non-Brazilian APEC 
strains.  If  there  are  distinct  APEC  subpathotypes,  it  may  be 
important  to  consider  when  developing  vaccines,  because 
new  vaccines  may  vary  in  ther  ability  to  prevent  infections 
caused by different pathotypes.
