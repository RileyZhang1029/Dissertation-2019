Background: Streptococcus mutans surface-protein antigen (SpaP, PAc, or antigen I/II) has been well known
to play an important role in initial attachment to tooth surfaces. However, strains with weak SpaP-expression
were recently reported to be found in natural populations of S. mutans. The S. mutans gbpC-negative strain
Z1, which we previously isolated from saliva and plaque samples, apparently expresses relatively low levels of
SpaP protein compared to S. mutans strains MT8148 or UA159.
Objective: To elucidate the mechanism for weak SpaP-expression in this strain, the spaP gene region in strain
Z1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzed.
Methods: Allelic exchange mutants between strains Z1 and UA159 involving the spaP gene region were
constructed. The SpaP protein expressed in the mutants was detected with Coomasie Brilliant Blue (CBB)-
staining and Western blot analysis following SDS-PAGE.
Results: The 4689 bp spaP gene coding sequence for Z1 appeared to be intact. In contrast, a 20 bp nucleotide
sequence appeared to be deleted from the region immediately upstream from the Z1 spaP gene when
compared to the same region in UA159. The 216 bp and 237 bp intergenic fragments upstream from the spaP
gene, respectively, from Z1 and UA159 were isolated, modified, and transformed into the other strain by
allelic replacement. The resultant UA159-promoter region-mutant exhibited extremely weak SpaP-expression
similar to that of strain Z1 and the Z1 complemented mutant expressed Spa protein levels like that of strain
UA159.
Conclusion: These results suggest that weak SpaP-expression in strain Z1 resulted from a 20 bp-deletion in the
spaP gene promoter region.

Streptococcus mutans is the primary etiologic agent

of human dental caries (1). Two major virulence
factors, cell surface protein antigen (SpaP/PAc)
and glucosyltransferases, have primarily been investigated
for their association with cariogenicity of this organism
(2). In addition, S. mutans has also been studied
in relation to infective endocarditis since this organism
has been occasionally isolated from the blood of en-
docarditis patients (3). Several candidates for virulence
factors as well as related molecules of this organism for
the disease have been suggested, e.g. fibronectin-binding
protein (4), enolase (5), or collagen adhesin (6), and so on
(7, 8). Nakano et al. (9) reported that a PAc-defective
mutant showed the lowest rate of phagocytosis and
suggested that S. mutans clinical
isolates with this

phenotype may be high-risk strains for the development
of bacteremia. Therefore, the SpaP protein may be a
candidate for a virulence-related factor in infective
endocarditis. In addition, Nakano et al. reported that 5
strains with extremely weak SpaP-expression were found
from 45 randomly selected oral strains composed of S.
mutans serotypes c, e, and f (15 strains each) in their
laboratory collection and that serotype k strains with this
phenotype were detected at higher frequency (7/11) (10).
We have identified a collagen adhesin gene cnm from S.
mutans strain Z1 selected from our laboratory collection.
This strain also exhibited extremely weak SpaP-expres-
sion. In the present study, we describe the analysis of the
spaP gene regions and elucidate a likely explanation
for weak SpaP-expression by constructing mutants

Materials and methods

Bacterial strains
The S. mutans strains used were Z1 (6), which is serotype
f, gbpC-negative, and cnm-positive strain previously
isolated from a saliva sample at Tokyo Dental College
(6, 11), MT8148 (12), and UA159 (13). The streptococci
were maintained on Todd-Hewitt (TH) broth/agar plates.
Escherichia coli strain DH5a was routinely used as a host
for plasmid construction.

Cell surfaceprotein sample preparation, SDS-PAGE,
and Western blot analysis
Preparation of
from
S. mutans strains was carried out as described previously
(14) with a slight modification. Briefly, approximately 20
mg wet weight of early stationary phase streptococcal cells
from 10 ml TH cultures were collected, washed, and
suspended in SDS-sample buffer (100 mg wet weight/ml),
boiled for 5 min, and supernatants were obtained as

extracts were
subjected to protein assays with the RC DC Protein Assay
Reagents (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA), and
frozen until electrophoretic analysis using the Laemmli-
gel system. Following SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins
were detected by Western blot analysis as described
previously (15) with anti-PAc (SpaP) (1/2000 dilution),
kindly provided by Y. Yamashita (Kyushu University,
Japan), and anti-Cnm sera (1/2500 dilution) (6).

PCRamplification,nucleotidesequencing,sequence
analysis, and plasmid construction
The regions corresponding to the surface protein antigen
gene spaP (pac) and the upstream regions in Z1 and
MT8148 were amplified and directly sequenced as
described previously (16). Sequence analyses were carried
out with GENETYX-MAC (Genetyx corporation, To-
kyo, Japan) program.

Two plasmids for constructing SpaP-expression repor-
ter mutants of S. mutans UA159 and Z1 strains were
prepared using plasmid pSY31 derived from pZ63
harboring the scrA::lacZ gene fusion previously de-
scribed (17). Constructed mutants besides the reporter
mutants, plasmids used to construct these mutants, and
primers used for amplification of the fragments cloned
into these plasmids are summarized in Table 1. Frag-
ments upstream from the spaP genes in UA159 and in Z1
were amplified with primer sets spa56/spaFuR and
spa56Z/spaFuR, respectively. These fragments containing
spaP upstream regions and the initiation codons of the
spaP genes were digested with HindIII and BamHI and
inserted into pSY31 digested with the same restriction

enzymes to establish spaP::lacZ fusions. The resultant
plasmids pZEJ1 and pZEK7 harboring the spaP::lacZ
fusion genes were confirmed with restriction digestion
and expression of b-galactosidase activities and used to
transform S. mutans UA159 and Z1 strains, respectively.
Several other plasmids were constructed for subsequent
transformation of S. mutans to construct chimera-chro-
mosome mutants, following manipulations of plasmid
pUC19 with a kanamycin resistant gene BamHI cassette
(kanr), an erythromycin resistant gene BamHI cassette
(Emr), the 3?-portion of the p40f (SMU.609) gene (18)
from UA159 (fragment p40f3), and the 5?-end of the spaP
gene with or without the intergenic regions from either
UA159 and Z1.

The PCR amplification was performed with high
fidelity DNA polymerase KOD-Plus (Toyobo, Osaka,
Japan) throughout this study. A 444 bp fragment, p40f3U
(681 to 238 in Fig. 2), was amplified from UA159
genomic DNA using primers spa56 and spa31. A 475 bp
fragment, spa5U (96 to 570 in Fig. 2), was amplified from
UA159 genomic DNA using primers spa53 and spa32
(containing an EcoRI site at the 5? end). This fragment
corresponds to the 5? region of the spaP gene devoid of
first 15 codons. An 807 bp fragment, IGspa5U (237 to
570 in Fig. 2) was amplified from UA159 genomic DNA
using primers spa52 and spa32. A 786 bp fragment,
IGspa5Z (216 to 570 in Fig. 2), was amplified from Z1
genomic DNA using primers spa52 and spa32.

HindIII digested p40f3U was initially cloned into
HindIII/HincII digested pUC19 and then the kanr or
Emr BamHI cassettes were inserted into the BamHI site
of this plasmid. The resultant plasmids were designated
as pZDX2 (p40f3U::kanr) and pZDZ1 (p40f3U::Emr),
respectively.
In addition, EcoRI-digested fragments
spa5U, IGspa5U, and IGspa5Z were cloned into SmaI/
EcoRI digested pUC19. The resultant plasmids were
digested with HindIII/HincII, ligated with HindIII/SmaI
p40f3U::kanr or p40f3U::Emr fragments excised from
pZDX2 or pZDZ1, and screened with kanamycin- or
erythromycin-resistant markers. As a result, three plas-
mids were finally constructed and designated as pZE91
(p40f3U::kanr::spa5U), pZE43 (p40f3U::Emr::IGspa5U),
and pZE55 (p40f3U::Emr::IGspa5Z).

Construction of reporter mutants, mutants with
chimericchromosomes,andb-galactosidaseassays
Plasmids pZEJ1 and pZEK7 were used to transform S.
mutans strains UA159 and Z1, respectively, by procedures
routinely carried out in this laboratory (19), and ery-
thromycin-resistant colonies were selected as mutants
EJUA2 and EKZ4 from which the chromosomal region
corresponding to the spaP::lacZ fusion genes and up-
stream regions were amplified by PCR and sequenced to
confirm the constructs.

Linear DNA fragments were amplified using primers
P7 and P8 (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with plasmids pZE91,
pZE43, and pZE55 as templates. The amplicons were
used to transform S. mutans by procedures described
above (19). An amplicon from pZE91 containing the
p40f3U::kanr::spa5U fragment was transformed into
S. mutans UA159 or Z1, and kanamycin-resistant colo-
nies were selected as mutants E9UA2 and E9Z1. These
mutants were further used as hosts for transformation
with fragments p40f3U::Emr:: IGspa5U or p40f3U::Emr::
IGspa5Z amplified with pZE43 or pZE55, Emr/kans
colonies were selected and mutants E4UA1, E5UA1,
and E4Z1 were obtained. The chromosomal regions
corresponding to the spaP genes and upstream regions
were amplified by PCR and confirmed by sequencing
with these constructs. Chromosomal rearrangements
around the spaP5? and upstream region in mutants are
summarized in Fig. 2 with UA159 and Z1.

Reporter mutant cells were disrupted using Tissue
Lyser (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 0.2 mm F
ceramics beads. Protein concentrations of cell
free
extracts were determined with DC Protein Assay Re-
agents (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Beta-galactosidase activ-
ities of these mutants were assayed according to the
DyNA Quant Application Note 2 (GE Healthcare Global
Headquarters, Pollards Wood, UK) using a DyNA
Quant 200 fluorophotometer and 4-methylumbelliferyl-
b-galactoside as a substrate.

Results

SpaP-expression and sequence analysis of spaP
upstream regions
The S. mutans cell surface proteins were isolated from
strains UA159, MT8148, and Z1 for analysis with SDS-
PAGE as described under the Materials and methods
section. A 190 kDa protein band corresponding to the
SpaP protein was detected in UA159 and MT8148 but
not observed in Z1 in Coomasie Brilliant Blue (CBB)-
stained polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1A). The entire spaP
gene sequence of Z1 was determined (Acc#: AB516671)
and an intact 4689 bp spaP gene coding sequence of Z1
was 99 and 97% identical
to those of UA159 and
MT8148, respectively. Therefore, weak SpaP-expression
in Z1 as a cell wall protein was not the result of a
truncation mutation within the coding sequence as
reported for strain GS-5 (14). We subsequently deter-
mined the 216 bp and 236 bp (Acc#: AB548069)
intergenic sequences upstream from the spaP genes,
respectively, in both Z1 and MT8148. Multiple aligned
sequence comparisons with UA159 were determined
with the DDBJ ClustalW program (Fig. 1B). The region
(116 to 1) conserved between UA159 and MT8148
was distinct from that corresponding to Z1, where a 20
bp deletion was detected (open square in Fig. 2B).

SpaP-expression reporter mutants, EJUA2 and EKZ4,
were used to quantify the difference in SpaP-expression
between UA159 and Z1. Beta-galactosidase activities of
mutants EJUA2 and EKZ4 were, respectively, 1.5491.09
(n6) and 0.016790.0079 (n6). SpaP-expression in
UA159 was deemed to be two orders of magnitude higher
compared to that of Z1.

These results suggested that a sequence responsible for
weak SpaP-expression in Z1 was contained within the 20
bp deleted region. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we
constructed UA159- and Z1-mutants, respectively, har-
boring putative Z1 and UA159 spaP-promoters and
examined the properties of these mutants.

Mutants with chimeric chromosomes and their
SpaP-expression levels
In order to introduce the entire intergenic region between
the p40f and spaP genes from Z1 into the corresponding
region of UA159 by allelic exchange, we initially con-
structed a mutant E9UA2 (Fig. 2C),
in which the
intergenic region and the first 15 codons of the spaP
gene were deleted from the chromosome following
transformation with the fragment, p40f3U::kanr::spa5U.
Using this mutant, the following mutants (E4UA1 and
E5UA1, Fig. 2E and F) were constructed. A series of
fragments used for these transformation procedures were
amplified from the plasmids constructed as described
under the Materials and methods section. Gene arrange-
ments around the intergenic regions in these mutants as
well as parental strains UA159 and Z1 are depicted in
Fig. 2. Mutant E4UA1 was constructed as a control
for E5UA1. Mutant E4Z1 was constructed from E9Z1
(Fig. 2D), which was constructed from Z1 with the same
p40f3U::kanr::spa5U fragment used to construct E9UA2
from UA159. In order to minimize polar effects, the
direction of transcription for the Emr gene was designed
to be opposite that of the spaP gene in all mutants
(Fig. 2). These arrangements should result in normalized
SpaP-expression in these mutants even though it was
possible that some promoter activity could still exist in
the Emr gene
the orientation opposite to that of
promoter.

The N-terminal 190 SpaP amino acid sequence en-
coded by the fragment IGspa5U was completely identical
to that encoded by the fragment IGspa5Z, although three
nucleotide substitutions had occurred in the 570nt spaP
5? coding sequences in both fragments. Therefore, E4UA1
and E5UA1 essentially harbor the same SpaP protein
sequences as do UA159. The E4Z1 also expresses the
same sequence of the SpaP protein as does strain Z1.

The SpaP-expression of

these mutants and their
parental strains was examined following CBB staining
of polyacrylamide gels containing resolved cell surface
protein extracts (Fig. 3A) and was determined by Western
blotting analysis (Fig. 3B) with anti-PAc (SpaP) serum.

Mechanism for weak SpaP-expression in S. mutans Z1

Fig. 1. CBB-stained polyacrylamide gel and intergenic sequence alignment. (A) SDS sample preparation was carried out as
described under the Materials and methods. 0.72, 0.76, 0.86 mg protein of samples, respectively, from strains UA159, MT8148,
and Z1 were applied to a 520% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The arrow indicates the positions of the 190 kDa bands
corresponding to the SpaP proteins. (B) Depicted multiple aligned intergenic (IG) sequences start with the termination codons
of the p40f (SMU.609) genes and end with the ATG initiation codons of the spaP genes in UA159IG, MT8148IG (AB548069),
and Z1IG (AB516671) sequences. Each sequence is numbered 1 at the ï¬rst nucleotide of the spaP ATG codon. Lines over the
UA159IG and lines under the Z1IG sequences, respectively, indicate 35 and 10 regions of the putative promoter sequences.
Boxes indicate direct repeat sequences.

A 190 kDa protein band corresponding to SpaP of
E5UA1 was not detected in the CBB stained gel and
Western blotting analysis similar to strain Z1 and the
spaP-negative mutant E9UA2 (Fig. 3A). This weak
expression did not result from insertion of the Emr gene
cassette into a position immediately downstream of
putative p40f gene because E4UA1, which has the same
insertion arrangement of Emr gene cassette as E5UA1,
expressed SpaP protein to the same extent as UA159. In
addition, E4Z1 that harbors the intergenic region origi-
nating from UA159 expressed SpaP protein at similar
levels as UA159. Since 190 kDa SpaP bands in E5UA1
and Z1 were not detected in the CBB stained gel and
since the SpaP-expression level in UA159 presumed to be
two orders of magnitude higher compared to that of Z1
was indicated by the b-galactosidase reporter assay, 12 ng
protein (1/100 diluted) of samples from E4Z1, E4UA1,
UA159, and 1.2 mg protein of samples from E5UA1 and
Z1 were applied to the polyacrylamide gel for Western
blotting. The analysis with anti-PAc (SpaP)
serum
(Fig. 3C) following SDS-PAGE indicated that anti-SpaP
serum reactive bands of 1/100 diluted samples from
E4Z1, E4UA1, and UA159 were almost the same extent
as those of one fold amount of samples from E5UA1 and
Z1. In addition to SpaP-expression, the chromosome
background of E4Z1 was confirmed by Western blot
analysis with anti-Cnm (collagen adhesin) serum as a
strain-specific marker for Z1 (data not shown).

These results suggest that the intergenic region, speci-
fically the 20 bp deletion within the upstream spaP region
in Z1, affected SpaP-expression.

Discussion
The S. mutans SpaP protein has been well known to play
a role in saliva-mediated aggregation and initial attach-
ment to tooth surfaces since the late 1980s (20). SpaP
protein is a predominant surface protein and is readily
detected in CBB-stained polyacrylamide gels under a
variety of growth conditions in several other strains
examined in this
laboratory besides UA159 and
MT8148. A simple method to prepare cell surface protein
samples was utilized in the present study. However, the
weak SpaP-expression observed in strain Z1 and mutant
E5UA1 does not result from a failure of cell wall protein
extraction. This is suggested since we have previously
reported that, in contrast to the UA159 fraction, a 190
kDa protein band corresponding to the SpaP protein of
S. mutans was only faintly observed in a Z1 wall-enriched
fraction isolated following N-acetylmuramidase digestion
(11). In addition, S. mutans strains exhibiting the weak
SpaP-expression phenotype were detected among those
naturally occurring in the oral cavity with lower fre-
quency in serotypes c, e, f, and higher in serotype k
strains (10). Therefore, our finding that Z1 did not
express this protein at
levels comparable to strain
UA159 or MT8148 is consistent with these earlier studies.

Fig. 2. Gene arrangements of parental strains and their
mutants. Chromosomal DNA regions corresponding to the
DNA fragments used for transformation of S. mutans to
construct the mutants are depicted in the ï¬gure and these
regions in the ï¬ve mutants are drawn with their background
DNA, since we cannot identify the actual recombination
points between the two homologous sequences. Positions
and directions of the Kanr and Emr cassettes are indicated
but their sizes are not drawn to scale. Open squares in (B)
and (F) indicate 20 bp deletions, sparsely and densely doted
small boxes in (F) and (G) indicate the ï¬rst 15 identical
codons of the spaP genes in strains Z1 and UA159.

Our results suggest that low level SpaP-expression is
ascribed to a 20 bp nucleotide deletion from the region
immediately upstream of the spaP gene. The distinct
SpaP phenotypes observed for E4UA1 and E5UA1 in a
UA159 genome background as well as the E4Z1 pheno-
type also support our hypothesis. However, we cannot
formally exclude another possible mechanism for this
phenotype, i.e. that the 20 bp nucleotide deletion was not
detected in the region of chromosome of the weak SpaP-
expressing strains. In addition, it is unlikely that all of the
previously reported low level SpaP-expression strains
harbor
the same 20 bp nucleotide deletion since
S. mutans is known for its genetic diversity. Three of
seven such serotype k strains have mutations within the
spaP genes (10), whose positions were distinct from that
in strain GS-5 (14). However,
five other strains (2
serotype c, 3 serotype f) with phenotypes (GbpC,
Cnm) very similar to Z1 have also been detected in
approximately 100 of our stock culture samples and these
harbored the same 20 bp deletion as Z1 (unpublished
data).

The SpaP-reactive bands in strains Z1 and E5UA1
shown in Fig. 3C were not as distinct as with the other
strains. A minor fraction of post-translationally unpro-
cessed protein or chemically modified proteins may have
been included in these SDS samples prepared using our

procedure. The amounts of UA159, E4UA1, and E4Z1
applied as samples in the Western blot analysis were 1/100
diluted compared to those of Z1 and E5UA1. Therefore,
minor fractions in the former samples may not have
detected. Anti-SpaP serum reactive bands in the mutants
were detected at slightly higher levels than those in their
parental strains. This may have resulted from additional
transcription from promoter activities within the Emr
fragment, although the Emr gene is arranged in the
opposite orientation relative to the spaP genes. However,
further analyses are necessary to resolve these questions.
The approximately 150 kDa bands in Fig. 3A corre-
sponded to glucosyltransferases (Gtf) B and C according
to our previous Western blotting results and banding
pattern
between UA159/E9UA2/E4UA1/
E5UA1 and Z1/E4Z1 very likely resulted from a differ-
ence in the genomic backgrounds between strains UA159
and Z1. However, a reason for difference in 150 kDa
band intensities between Z1 and E4Z1 is presently
unknown, since Gtf expression of E4Z1 should not
have been affected by the introduced mutation.

difference

The SpaP molecules consist of several domains includ-
ing the P-region (12, 21). Another report concerning
SpaP-expression/regulation indicated that the spaP gene
lacking its P-region nucleotides resulted in a complete
absence of surface-localized SpaP protein, although
the reason for this is still unknown (22). However, this
is not a finding affecting our hypothesis because the Z1
spaP gene is intact like that of UA159.

The UA159 intergenic sequence corresponding to the
20 bp deletion (58 to 39) overlapped with the presumed
spaP-promoter (-86 TTGACA-N17-TACAAT -59, lines
over the sequences in Fig. 1B). This deleted sequence was
likely changed to a low activity promoter (-66 TTGACA-
N17-TACAAA -39, lines under the sequences in Fig. 1B)
resulting from the 20 bp deletion in Z1. Furthermore, 10
bp direct repeats were detected overlapping with the spaP
promoter regions in UA159 and MT8148 (boxes in
Fig. 1B). Unequal crossover during DNA replication or
homologous recombination involving the 10 bp direct
repeats may have occurred in Z1 under certain selective
pressures in the past. However,
further experiments
are required to determine whether the single nucleotide
substitution in the 10 region or other factors are
involved in the change to a low activity promoter. This
line of work is currently in progress by employing a site-
directed mutagenesis.

Strain Z1 is cnm-positive and gbpC-negative as de-
scribed previously (6) in addition to the SpaP phenotype.
How Z1 could have survived in the oral cavity with the
GbpC-negative and weak SpaP phenotype is an interest-
ing question. Inactivation of the S. mutans spaP resulted
in a decrease in gp340-mediated cell aggregation that
contributes to the clearance of S. mutans cells from the
oral cavity in vivo (20, 23). Therefore, cells with low SpaP

Mechanism for weak SpaP-expression in S. mutans Z1

Fig. 3. CBB-stained polyacrylamide gel (A) and Western blot analyses (B, C) of mutants and their parental strains. (A) Samples
(1.2 mg protein) prepared as described under Materials and methods were applied to the 520% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide
gel. (B) Diluted samples (12 ng protein) were applied to the gel for the following Western blotting analysis. Anti-PAc (SpaP)
serum diluted 1:2000 was used as the ï¬rst antibody. The ECL Plus Western blotting reagents (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire,
UK) were used for detection. (C) Samples for Z1, E9UA2, and E5UA1 (1.2 mg) as well as for UA159, E4UA1, and E4Z1 (12 ng)
were applied to the gel and determined by Western blotting analysis.

levels may be able to escape from such clearance and can
attach to teeth by glucosyltransferases-mediated adher-
ence mediated by adhesive glucans as suggested by
Lemos et al. (24). Extremely low level SpaP expressing
strains have been isolated as described above. A PAc-
defective mutant showed the lowest rate of phagocytosis
and suggested that S. mutans clinical isolates with this
phenotype may be high-risk strains for the development
of bacteremia (9). One of the strains isolated from
endocarditis patients was reported to be cnm-positive
(25) and gbpC-defective (26), although the mutation
positions in the gbpC genes in these two strains were
distinct. Further analyses for virulent phenotypes or
genotypes of strains involved in infective endocarditis
are necessary to further delineate the role of these factors
in virulence.
