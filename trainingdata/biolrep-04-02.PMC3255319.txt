Abstract
In the past 5 years, a convergence of studies has resulted in a broad appreciation in the cancer
research community that reprogramming of cellular metabolism may be more central to cancer than
appreciated in the past 30 years. The re-emergence of cancer metabolism stems in part from
discoveries that a number of common oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes more directly control
cell metabolism than previously thought. In addition, a number of what would previously have been
called “card-carrying” metabolic enzymes have been identified as human tumor suppressors or
oncogenes, causally mutated in a variety of human cancers. This growing appreciation of the role of
altered cell metabolism has led to further investigation into the rate-limiting proteins involved in
different aspects of the unique metabolism of tumor cells. Targeting cancer metabolism with drugs
requires a therapeutic window in which tumor cells, compared to normal tissues, have a greater
dependence on specific metabolic enzymes. Themes that have emerged in the past decade of
developing oncogene-targeted cancer therapeutics suggest that tumors with distinct oncogenic
lesions are likely to require drugs that target distinct metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the hope is that
detailed knowledge of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene functions and their effects on
metabolism will lead to drug combinations that will be far more effective in treating cancers.

Introduction and context
During the process of
tumorigenesis, genetic and
epigenetic events allow the metabolism of the cancer
cells to evolve in a manner that optimizes conditions for
growth and survival in the tumor microenvironment.
The observation by Otto Warburg in 1924 of increased
reliance of tumor cells on aerobic glycolysis in the
cytosol, and conversion of pyruvate to lactate rather than
its entry into the mitochondrial pathway for oxidative
phosphorylation, was one of the first identified bio-
chemical distinctions of cancer cells [1]. Discoveries in
the late 1970s and early 1980s revealed that cancers
could result from somatic mutations that caused either
gain of function (oncogenes) or loss of function (tumor
suppressors) of normal genes involved in cellular
regulation. Since none of the early oncogenes or tumor

suppressor genes were metabolic enzymes, and since
studies in the 1960s and 1970s revealed exceptions to the
Warburg observation, enthusiasm for the study of cancer
cell metabolism waned. In the past ten years, a dramatic
resurgence in interest in cancer metabolism has occurred
as a number of tumor suppressors and oncogenes have
been identified that directly regulate cellular metabolism
(see figure 1), indicating a more prominent role for
metabolism in tumorigenesis than previously appre-
ciated [2].
In particular, a number of connections
between cellular metabolism and the phosphoinosi-
tide-3kinase/Akt pathway have been made, involving
activation of
the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) signaling pathways [3]. mTOR has emerged as
a coordinator of cell growth and metabolism in response
to a wide variety of environmental cues including growth

factors and nutrients such as oxygen, glucose, and amino
acids [4]. The last 5 years have seen tens of new
components of this critical pathway decoded, linking
growth and metabolism [3]. Another unexpected genetic
link between tumorigenesis and metabolism was the
identification of
the LKB1/STK11 tumor suppressor
(which switches cells from ATP consumption to ATP
production) as the critical kinase needed to activate the
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) under conditions
of low cellular energy [5-7]. This direct linkage of a tumor
suppressor with a central regulator of cellular energy,

lipid and glucose metabolism, has led to a number of
new findings showing the convergent mechanisms by
which AMPK reprograms cell metabolism in opposition
to mTOR signaling [8]. As described in detail below, a
number of additional connections have now led to a
large number of labs decoding the circuitry by which
mitogenic signaling pathways control metabolism.
Reflecting the accumulated evidence suggesting that
altered cellular metabolism is a common feature of
most cancers, in an update on their seminal “Hallmarks
of Cancer” review, Hanahan and Weinberg added

“deregulating cellular energetics” as an emerging seventh
hallmark of cancer cells [9].

The emergence of 18-flourodeoxyglucose positron emis-
sion tomography (FDG-PET) as a common imaging
modality for visualizing a wide variety of human cancers
pointedly illustrated Warburg’s observations, by showing
the increased glucose utilization of tumors compared to
most surrounding normal tissues. Initially it seemed
counter-intuitive that tumor cells would switch towards
the less-efficient ATP generation from aerobic glycolysis
rather than from oxidative phosphorylation in mito-
chondria. However,
increased glycolysis allows the
diversion of glycolytic intermediates into intersecting
biosynthetic pathways,
including those generating
amino acids and nucleosides, which fuel the biosynthesis
of the macromolecules required for proliferating cells [2].
It should be pointed out that the increased glycolytic
flux observed in some tumors does not remove the
need for mitochondrial function, as mitochondria play
key roles in biosynthetic pathways other than their role
in ATP synthesis. Another broad finding has been the
dependence of many cancer cells on elevated glutamine
metabolism in addition to, or in some cases instead of,
increased glucose metabolism. In fact, not all tumors
exhibit high rates of glycolysis, as evidenced by their failure
to be visualized by FDG-PET, and it is likely that many of
these FDG-PET negative tumors are fueled by glutamine.
The unique sensitivity of tumor cells to glutamine levels
has been appreciated for a number of years, which is
thought to due to the fact that like glucose, glutamine
can be used to generate ATP as well as a number of key
metabolic intermediates [10].

The past 5 years have witnessed an explosion of research in
this area as more of the critical regulatory steps deregulated
in tumors have been decoded. These advances have been
accompanied by the hope that tumors may be targeted
therapeutically by taking advantage of
their unique
metabolic needs and reprogramming, exposing a theore-
tical Achilles heel. As our knowledge of the key regulatory
steps in metabolic reprogramming in different cancers
advances,
it also has begun to emerge that distinct
oncogenes use complimentary molecular mechanisms to
achieve the same ends of
increased glucose and/or
glutamine metabolism. Here we review a number of the
recent advances in our understanding of the circuitry of
cancer cell metabolism, and discuss how these pathways
might be exploited therapeutically.

Transcriptional control allows for coordinated
reprogramming of metabolic enzymes
Studies from several different lines of investigation
have revealed that a handful of transcription factors

directly bind to the promoters of a number of
metabolic enzymes. This allows for coordinate up-
and down-regulation of entire metabolic processes
based on the activity of these transcription factors.
Best-appreciated currently are the transcription factors
HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1), c-Myc, and Srebp-1.
The HIF-1a was initially discovered to directly bind to
the promoter of one isoform of nearly every protein
responsible for a step of glycolysis [11] from the
glucose transporter (GLUT1) all the way through to
pyruvate kinase,
inducing their expression under
hypoxic conditions. In addition, HIF-1a induces lactate
production via increases in lactate dehydrogenase A
mRNA and suppresses flux of pyruvate into oxidative
phosphorylation by inducing the PDK1 (pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase 1) mRNA, and inhibits entry of
pyruvate into the oxidative phosphorylation pathway
[12,13]. The discovery that
the von-Hippel Lindau
tumor suppressor protein encodes a ubiquitin ligase
responsible for HIF-1a protein turnover under nor-
moxic conditions provided a direct
link between
glucose metabolism and some forms of cancer [14].
This increased reliance on glycolysis and movement
away from oxidative phosphorylation makes sense, as
a physiological response to oxygen deprivation in
which oxidative phosphorylation would not be func-
tional. Furthermore, HIF-1a translation and transcrip-
tion are increased under normoxic conditions by the
mammalian target of
rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1), providing another mechanism for HIf-1a
upregulation across a broad spectrum of human
cancers. As a side note, HIF-1a and its closely related
transcription factor HIF-2a are thought to be redun-
dant
functions and are
co-regulated by many of
the same mechanisms.
Importantly, in different tissue contexts, distinctions
in their function do exist and studies suggest that
HIF-2a is more oncogenic than HIF-1a, and that in
some contexts HIF-1a may actually suppress the
oncogenic effects of HIF-2a [15] .

though not all,

in many,

The oncogene c-Myc was also found to bind directly to
the same promoters as HIF-1a (lactate
many of
dehydrogenase A, HK2), synergizing with HIF-1a and
the closely related transcription factor, HIF-2a, depending
on the context [16]. Notably, unlike HIF-1a, c-Myc was
also shown to control glutamine metabolism [17]. Myc
control of glutamine metabolism probably operates via
multiple mechanisms, but one interesting development
was the discovery that Myc repression of the mIR23a/b
microRNAs results in increased expression of mitochon-
drial glutaminase (GLS1), one of
the rate-limiting
regulators of glutamine metabolism [18]. Myc is thought
to be altered in up to 40% of all human cancers, and thus

its dual control of glucose and glutamine metabolism
makes this a common mechanism by which these
processes are increased in cancer.

that

An additional commonality of c-myc and HIF-1a is that
they both have been shown to be translationally
upregulated by mTORC1-signaling. Strikingly, a third
transcription factor that controls cell metabolism is also
a target of mTORC1-dependent translational control:
Srebp-1 [19]. Srebp-1 was originally discovered as the
sterol-sensing transcription factor
induces the
expression of fatty acid synthesis genes in the liver in
response to insulin and sterols in the blood. Studies
over the past 5 years have revealed that Srebp-1 has
general roles in lipid synthesis across most cell types
that may be essential for increased lipid production
during cell proliferation [20]. More recently, transcrip-
tional profiling revealed that in fibroblasts, Srebp-1 is
one of
the main targets of mTORC1 in regulating
transcription, and here Srebp-1 induces not only
lipogenic genes but also several enzymes in the
oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway
[19]. Thus, three main transcription factors controlled
by mTORC1: HIF, Myc, and Srebp-1, emerge as central
regulators of cellular metabolism that may be deregu-
lated in a majority of tumor cells. HIFs shift glucose
metabolism towards anaerobic glycolysis, together with
c-Myc, which also increases glutamine metabolism,
while Srebp-1 increases lipid production.

Mechanisms controlling key metabolic
regulators
As common nodes for metabolic control have been
revealed, a plethora of mechanisms have emerged to
explain how the expression and activities of
these
enzymes are controlled, and these mechanims are far
more complex than the product
inhibition models
previously taught in introductory biochemistry classes.
A few examples follow.

One of the newly appreciated steps by which mitogenic
signals from oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases connect
to the glycolytic machinery is via inhibition of the M2
isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) a key regulator of
glycolysis [21,22]. This inhibition is accomplished by a
novel mechanism in which binding of PKM2 to other
tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins triggers release of the
allosteric activator,
fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP)
which inhibits PKM2. Alternative splicing controls the
swapping in and out of a single short exon that encodes
residues in PKM2 that allow binding to phosphotyrosine
and the linkage between phosphotyrosine binding and
release of FBP. In contrast the PKM1 alternatively spliced
form contains residues that maintain the enzyme in a

highly active state, independent of FBP. Interestingly, the
PKM1 isoform is expressed in most terminally differ-
entiated, non-dividing cells, whereas all dividing cells
that have been investigated, both normal and cancerous,
express the M2 isoform. This splicing event is controlled,
in part, by the expression of hnRNP A1 and A2 proteins
whose promoters are in turn regulated by c-Myc [23,24].
In addition to the splicing to PKM2, the promoter is
upregulated by HIF-1a in an mTORC1-dependent way,
thus giving tumors with elevated mTOR activity higher
levels of PKM2 [25]. Finally, the activity of PKM2 is also
decreased by acetylation under high glucose conditions
[26] consistent with suppression by pro-growth signals,
such as tyrosine phosphorylation. Another unique
function of the M2, but not M1, isoform of PKM was
reported to be translocation to the nucleus and direct
transactivation of HIF-1a [27]. In this capacity, PKM2
would be reinforcing its own expression and that of other
HIF-1a targets reprogramming glucose metabolism.

Another example of multifaceted regulation is that of
GLS1, which encodes a form of glutaminase that resides
in the mitochondria and converts glutamine to glutami-
nate, for use in TCA cycle anaplerosis. As aforemen-
tioned, glutaminase mRNA is upregulated by c-Myc
through an indirect mechanism involving repression of
mIR23a/b, which targets GLS1. GLS1 mRNA has also
been shown to be upregulated by NFkB, downstream of
other oncogenic signals [28].
In addition, GLS1 is
alternatively spliced to form a shorter protein, GAC,
whose expression is elevated in certain cancers. Further
links between call proliferation and metabolism come
from the observation that glutaminase protein levels are
targeted by the APC/C protease during the cell cycle,
ensuring a careful temporal control over glutaminase
activity during the cell cycle [29].

Another metabolic enzyme whose turnover is controlled
by APC/C is the “inducible” form of phosphofructoki-
nase 2 (iPFK2/PFKFB3) [29]. PFKFBP3 is a HIF-1a target
gene, upregulated in Ras-dependent tumor cells, and also
has the unique distinction of being directly phosphory-
lated by Akt and AMPK on different sites [30]. The
convergence of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases,
acetylases, ubiquitin ligases, miRNA, splicing, and
transcriptional controls onto these 3 enzymes (PKM2,
GLS1, and iPFK2/PFKFBP3) gives a hint of the level of
complexity that is likely to emerge for many of the
proteins at the nodes of metabolic control.

Bona fide metabolic enzymes as tumor
suppressors and oncogenes in human cancer
Positional cloning efforts in familial cancer syndromes
led to the identification of many if not most of the

known human tumor suppressors,
ranging from
retinoblastoma protein (Rb) to PTEN to the tuberous
sclerosis complex proteins. Studies of inherited forms
of human paraganglioma and pheochromocytosis led
to identification of inactivating mutations in genes that
encode the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex
subunits B, C, and D in these tumors. A second TCA
cycle enzyme, fumarate hydratase, was also found to be
responsible for rare inherited forms of leiomyoma and
renal carcinomas [31]. These identifications fulfill
Warburg’s prediction that defects in mitochondrial
respiration may underlie human cancer, albeit only in
these rare cases. Interestingly, a recent study identified
mutations in the gene for a novel conserved protein
required for flavination of SDH subunit A, termed
SDH5, which was subsequently determined to account
for some of the paraglioma cases not bearing muta-
tions in other SDH genes [32].

More examples come from unbiased genomic sequen-
cing in human glioblastomas, which first revealed
missense mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase genes,
IDH1 and IDH2 [33]. Unexpectedly,
the mutations
found in IDH1 and IDH2 conferred a gain-of-function
resulting in mutant forms of the enzyme capable of
converting a-ketoglutarate into 2-hydroxyglutarate [28].
2-hydroxyglutarate has been proposed to act as an
“oncometabolite” [34], interfering with the function of
the many enzymes that use a-ketoglutarate as a co-factor,
including PHD proteins that degrade HIFs and many
histone methyl transferases such as the TET1 and TET2
oncoproteins [35]. Collectively,
these data suggest a
mechanism by which a gain-of-function in a single
metabolic enzyme can stimulate reprogramming of cell
fate, more than just metabolic state.

Two recent studies discovered another example of a
metabolic enzyme acting directly as an oncogene due
to amplification in a subset of human breast cancers
[36,37]. Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase is an
enzyme that diverts the glycolytic intermediate 3-
phosphoglycerate into the serine synthesis pathway.
Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase was found to be
amplified in a subset of primary tumors and breast
cancer cell lines, and those bearing phosphoglycerate
dehydrogenase amplification also exhibited elevated
flux through the serine synthesis pathway. These same
lines, but not those lacking phosphoglycerate dehy-
drogenase amplification, were uniquely sensitive to
growth suppression by PHDGH shRNA, suggesting that
agents targeting phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase may
be useful in treating the subset of breast cancers that
exhibit phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
gene
amplification.

Therapeutically targeting metabolism
One of the exciting prospects for exploiting the unique
metabolism of tumor cells is that there appear to be only
a limited set of metabolic pathways that most cancer cells
up-regulate to accomplish growth and survival. Altered
metabolism in the tumor cells, compared with the tissue
of origin creates a theoretical therapeutic window in
which normal cells will not be affected by therapies
targeting metabolism,
though clearly those simply
targeting the metabolism found in proliferating cells
will not be any different than conventional chemothera-
pies targeting nucleotide synthesis enzymes needed by
all cells going through S phase (e.g. 5FU, methotrexate).
Similarly, metabolic drugs that inhibit lipogenic or other
anabolic processes needed in all dividing cells or needed
to maintain adult quiescent stem cells will not likely
improve on existing therapies. However, as all advanced
tumor cells reprogram their metabolism to some extent
or another, decoding the specific enzymes and isoforms
upregulated in each tumor type based on the genetic
mutations present will allow a set of genotype-specific
targeted therapeutics based on inhibition of metabolic
enzymes. This is a largely unexplored space in current
cancer research efforts. Based on our current under-
standing of pathways deregulated in cancer, investiga-
tion of a handful of promising therapeutic agents have
begun, including agents targeting lactate dehydrogenase
A and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases and other
glycolytic enzymes that have been validated by shRNA
studies in tumor cells lines. It remains to be seen whether
these early compounds have sufficient specificity and
pharmaceutical properties to achieve target inhibition
without off-target toxicity. Another challenge will be to
identify the biomarkers that predict patients who are
likely to respond to such therapies, as well as biomarkers
that verify that the drug has hit its intended target.

Future Prospects
As the field of cancer cell metabolism continues to grow
over the next decade, a better picture of what steps are
universal across many tumor types and what metabolic
reprogramming is unique to one particular tumor
genotype or tissue type will emerge. Based on these
findings, new tools for imaging tumors and, hopefully,
new therapeutics will emerge. To get to the stage of new
FDA-approved anti-cancer agents, much work is needed.
It is likely that, through ongoing mutational analyses of
human tumors and extensive functional RNAi screens,
additional metabolic enzymes will emerge as candidates
for therapeutic intervention. Once candidate genes are
found, full genetic dissection of the requirement for
these components in tumors from different tissues with
different initiating mutations is needed. Even in cases
where a particular metabolic enzyme is critical in a

specific tumor type, detailed studies are also needed to
define likely resistance mechanisms and effective com-
binations of targeted therapeutics and metabolic ther-
apeutics in specific tumor types. In short, cancers are far
more complex than was once imagined and it is clear
that many weapons will be needed to combat this
devastating disease. Targets in the metabolic arena offer a
new opportunity to expand the arsenal.
