Abstract
The benefits of marine ecosystems for people are increasingly being characterized through the
concept of ecosystem services, with the promise to aid decision making from marine spatial planning
to ecosystem-based management. The characterization of changes in marine ecosystem services is
central to the application of ecological science to policy contexts, and this field is quickly evolving
with innovations in frameworks for integrating science, understanding of ecosystems and human
benefits, and innovations in tools for the modeling of services. In this article, we review efforts to
characterize changes in marine ecosystem services, including recent advances, and we propose five
key future directions for research: cultural values, qualitative or semi-quantitative modeling
approaches, cumulative impacts, model evaluation, and markets.

Introduction and context
What are marine ecosystem services?
Ecosystem services – the processes whereby ecosystems
render benefits to people [1] – are becoming the
principal means for communicating ecological change
in terms of human benefits [2-4]. Understanding
ecosystem services is fundamental to decision-making
efforts that influence multiple human activities and
components of ecosystems, informing management and
planning decisions such as the appropriate scale and
location of a number of activities. Wise and sustainable
decisions of this nature will require a comprehensive
understanding of how changes in human activities and
ecosystem states will result in changes in ecosystem
services and the associated benefits to people [5].

Although much initial research focused on characterizing
changes in ecosystem services was rooted in terrestrial
and freshwater ecosystems [6,7], ecosystem services has
become a central concept in applied marine ecological
research and in decision making [8,9]. Examples of
marine ecosystem services include provision of seafood
for consumption (both farmed and wild), contribution

to recreational opportunities, nutrient cycling and
filtration of wastes, coastal/natural hazard protection,
carbon storage for climate regulation, provision of
medium for transport (e.g., shipping), and provision of
existence and cultural values [10,11].

Why we need this
Recent efforts in marine ecosystem-based management
(EBM) and marine spatial planning have heightened the
calls to characterize changes in or to model (given the
emphasis on change and a broad interpretation of
modeling [simple representation of a phenomenon],
we treat characterizing changes and modeling as
synonyms here) ecosystem services under alternative
management schemes [9,12-14]. A few examples of EBM
efforts in the sea (e.g., Great Barrier Reef Marine Park)
approach management of marine resources from an
ecosystem perspective aimed at achieving multiple
objectives [15]. Even classically single-sector approaches
to managing marine resources (e.g., fisheries) increas-
ingly are broadening their scope to include several
ecosystem components (e.g., gear impacts on habitat
and food webs) and compatibility with activities in other

sectors (e.g., recreation and shipping) [9,16,17].
If
interactions between activities can be understood in an
ecosystem context through ecosystem service tradeoffs,
spatially explicit valuation of possible ecosystem service
changes could guide marine spatial planning by inform-
ing whether particular tradeoffs are ‘worth it’.

Another growing purpose of ecosystem service research is
to raise awareness regarding the widespread and valuable
nature of ecosystems for humanity. Such communica-
tion efforts have contributed to the development of
markets for ecosystem services such as storing and
sequestering carbon, and more are under development
for habitats such as mangroves, which are now included
in REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and
degradation) policies. Generally, the demand is increas-
ing for unassailable accounting of changes in ecosystem
service ‘co-benefits’ that accompany ecosystem changes
in carbon, biodiversity, and other components (e.g.,
[18,19]).

Academic traditions and development of ideas
Emerging research on marine ecosystem services draws
upon a rich field of research in terrestrial ecosystem
services (see Nelson and Daily’s F1000 report [20]) and
ecosystem-based fisheries management [16,21] and
within fields that generally have focused on one or two
ecosystem services at a time (e.g., coastal protection and
aesthetics). However, whereas terrestrial ecosystem
service modeling can be rooted in land use/land cover
change and topography (elevation) [7], there is no
central and uniting habitat-layer equivalent in marine
ecosystems, and connections among locations via flows
of nutrients, larvae, and pollutants are both variable and
more difficult to discern (Guerry et al., unpublished
data). Marine ecosystem service research will need to
account for such flows and their complexities [22].

Much early progress on ecosystem services was directed
toward appropriate methods of valuation [6]. Because
most provisioning services already were associated with
marketed goods (e.g., provision of seafood linked to fish
sold commercially), they generally have been quantified
through market valuation [23]. Regulating services such
as mitigation of natural hazards generally have been
valued through avoided cost and replacement cost
methods, although the latter in particular have been
frequently misapplied [6]. Cultural services have proven
most contentious to value [24]. Whereas many have not
been valued (e.g., contribution to subsistence activities,
to artistic experiences, and to ceremonial experiences)
tractable valuation methods are emerging for
[24],
particular services (e.g.,
travel-cost methods for the
contribution to recreational activities, hedonic pricing

for the contribution to aesthetic values, and contingent
valuation for the provision of existence values) [6].

Although there is no comprehensive body of theory on
marine ecosystem services, some important
founda-
tional studies include the identification of marine
ecosystem services [10,25], demonstration of non-linear
responses such as for wave attenuation in a context of
multiple ecosystem services in coastal Thailand [26],
valuation of the contribution of mangroves to fishery
yields in the Gulf of California [27], and relationships
between biodiversity and key ecosystem functions such
as productivity and nutrient cycling [28,29]. The nature
of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem
services continues to be debated [30,31].

transfer’ approaches,

Major recent advances
Early efforts to quantify ecosystem services relied heavily
on so-called ‘benefit
in which
existing studies valuing ecosystem benefits are applied
to other sites, thus enabling the estimation of ecosystem
service benefits at new locations [32-35]. Although such
approaches are appealing because they are inexpensive
and valuation results can be obtained relatively quickly,
many applications are fraught with problems, such as
transferring benefits to incomparable sites and scaling
benefits up from original studies conducted at small
scales [36]. Projecting future ecosystem service values is
not possible with the benefit-transfer approach without
assuming that current correlations between habitat
conditions, processes, and values will remain unchanged
in the future – assumptions that weaken its applicability
in management contexts. There are multiple recent
efforts afoot to model marine ecosystem services (Multi-
scale Integrated Models of Ecosystem Services [MIMES]
[37], Artificial
Intelligence for Ecosystem Services
[ARIES] [38], and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem
Services and Tradeoffs [InVEST] tool [7,39]), and each
seems to be improving upon previous approaches in one
manner or another. (Because of the newness of these
tools, not all of them have been documented in the peer-
reviewed literature.) For example, ARIES adjusts benefit-
transfer estimates based on the extent to which services
are essential and substitutable [38].

The InVEST tool takes an alternative ‘ecological production
function’ approach that explicitly models how changes in
ecosystem structure, function, and processes give rise to
changes in ecosystem services [5,6]. The production
function approach is being developed and applied for a
suite of marine ecosystem services by the Marine Initiative
of the Natural Capital Project. The Marine InVEST tool
quantitatively estimates how climate, management, and
policy scenarios specified by users affect ecosystem

processes, which in turn affect the delivery and socio-
economic value of (a) coastal protection from erosion and
inundation provided by abiotic and biogenic habitats,
(b) food from fisheries, (c) food from benthic or floating
aquaculture, (d) wave energy capture, and (e) recreational
activities such as whale watching, beach going, and
recreational harvesting of shellfish [22,40].

As the notion of ecosystem services has matured from a
concept to an explicitly stated objective in management
and policy (e.g., [41-43]), a clear need for distinct metrics
of supply, demand, and value of services has emerged
(Tallis et al., unpublished data). This has long been
recognized in fisheries, where biomass of fish, landed
biomass, and market value of fished species have been
enumerated and used in bio-economic modeling (e.g.,
[44]). Applications of such metrics along the supply
chain to beneficiaries are less common for other types of
services, but there exist approaches to define such metrics
for market and non-market goods (Tallis et al., unpub-
lished data and [45]). The need for greater specificity in
the underlying models is driven by the need for clear
accounting of changes in ecosystem service values in real
applications.

Another important advance is the development of
frameworks for integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA)
[46,47] and EBM [9,48]. IEA is an approach rooted in
formal decision theory and is intended to provide a
foundation for EBM. Such frameworks will be instru-
mental for characterizing ecosystem service change in
support of decision making because they provide a
structured approach to handling the dizzying set of
choices ecosystem service modelers must make to
capture sufficient relevant detail while avoiding over-
whelming complexity.

From ecosystem-based fisheries management, represen-
tations of fleet dynamics and a value chain approach
capture several ecosystem and socioeconomic elements,
resulting in a much broader characterization of the
socioeconomic value of a fishery [49,50]. Such advances
will facilitate the extension of traditional trophic models
to ecosystem service models. An emerging alternative is
the Atlantis model, which is explicitly spatial and
includes water quality dynamics and their effects through
a food web model; Atlantis also supports sophisticated
fleet dynamics, fishing gear details, and feedbacks on the
economic value of landings [51,52]. The broader inclu-
sion of ecosystem processes positions Atlantis to more
easily embrace a suite of ecosystem services which goes
beyond fisheries, but its rigidly detailed structure could
prevent widespread adoption. The complexity required
of these models to realistically represent the effects of

fishing on marine ecosystems highlights the tension
between (a) complexity for the sake of realism and (b)
simplicity and timeliness for relating to decision making.

Developments in visualizing model outputs facilitate
selection of decision alternatives that differ along multiple,
often incommensurate, dimensions of indicator perfor-
mance. On this front, the use of tradeoff-visualization
approaches borrowed from environmental economics
(e.g., [53]) promises to be of some use [54]. For visualizing
performance of several decision alternatives across many
dimensions of performance, consequence matrices from
the decision-analysis literature are likely to be of greater
use [55-57].

Future directions
Cultural ecosystem services represent a considerable gap
in ecosystem service modeling. This category of ecosys-
tem services (which includes the contribution to recrea-
tional experiences, aesthetic enjoyment, scientific
inspiration, and cultural identity) generally has defied
quantitative characterization and modeling;
tourism
(e.g., [58]) and aesthetics (e.g., [59]) are exceptions to
this. There is great demand for tools to include such
services, but for the many intangible categories of such
services, there is as yet no parallel method of characteriz-
ing how they will be affected by ecosystem change. Chan
and colleagues [24] proposed a very simple framework
for spatial modeling of cultural ecosystem services in
partnership with local knowledge-holders, but its wide-
spread applicability remains undemonstrated. It is also
unclear whether increasingly sophisticated approaches
will be possible or culturally appropriate. Kai Chan is
co-leading (with Anne Guerry) a working group at the US
National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis to
help answer such questions.

Ecosystem service modeling will continue to benefit
from a broad set of approaches. Ecosystem dynamics –
which virtually always include both social and ecological
subsystems [60] – can become exceedingly complex to
model if data-driven, quantitative approaches are the
only ones considered. There is a scarcity of data for
parameterizing fully quantitative ecosystem models that
include species interactions and relationships between
drivers of change and ecosystem service change. Factor-
ing in possible synergistic impacts from multiple drivers
and non-linearities due to ecological processes that are
emergent phenomena of complex systems [61] is likely
to be more feasible with qualitative or semi-quantitative
approaches [62,63].

A central need in modeling marine ecosystem services is
for the inclusion of cumulative impacts: we need a

greatly improved understanding of how ecosystem
states, processes, and functions translate into changes
in ecosystem services and how instances of multiple
drivers in different places and at different scales
combine to produce cumulative impacts on various
ecosystem services [54]. Theory suggests that we should
expect abundant non-linearities in social-ecological
systems [64,65] – so ecosystem service production
functions will be a key approach – but we have precious
few characterizations of these non-linearities (but see
[26]). The mapping of cumulative impacts on ecosys-
tems has increased [66,67], but for ecosystem service
research to contribute to decision making, we must
quickly advance beyond mapping to the characteriza-
tion of how these impacts change multiple ecosystem
services.

As we develop ecosystem service models based on the
best available understanding, there will be a crucial role
for evaluating such models. There is some debate about
the kind of utility such ecosystem service models have:
whether they are or could be predictive in a quantita-
tively accurate sense (i.e., tactical) or illustrative in a
heuristic sense (i.e., strategic or qualitatively informa-
tive). Answers to such questions are likely to be scale-
and context-dependent, but given the nascent state of our
understanding and the complexities inherent in building
ecosystem models, we generally see early ecosystem
service models as being primarily of qualitative or
strategic use. But even for this use, the accuracy of
model projections will vary and must be assessed for
each model in turn. We argue that such learning should
follow as closely as possible a rigorous adaptive manage-
ment approach [68].

There is great interest in the development of markets for
marine ecosystem services (e.g., fishery catch shares,
water quality, and nursery habitat protection) [69-72].
So far, there are no good measures or accountability
systems for most marine ecosystem services [73], so
ecosystem service characterization, quantification, and
modeling will be central
to these efforts. Although
market-oriented efforts for marine conservation are sure
to be controversial [74-77], the more fully ecosystem
service researchers can characterize ecosystem services
and other values at stake in such market efforts (both
intended and unintended consequences),
the more
wisely such market approaches may proceed.
