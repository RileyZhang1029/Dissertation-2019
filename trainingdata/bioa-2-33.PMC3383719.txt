COMMENTARY

Staging a recovery from mitotic arrest
Unusual ways of Cdk1

Checkpoint controls, the surveillance

pathways that impose “an order of
execution” on the major cell cycle events,
are critical to the maintenance of genome
stability. When cells fail to execute a
cellular event or do so erroneously due to
misregulation or exposure to genotoxic
stresses,
these evolutionarily conserved
regulatory circuits prevent passage to the
subsequent event, thus bringing the cell
cycle to a halt. Once the checkpoint
stimulus is removed, cells recover from
the arrest and eventually resume cell
cycle progression. While the activation,
execution and maintenance,
the three
major aspects of the checkpoint controls,
have been investigated in detail,
the
recovery process remains underexplored.
It is not clear if cells recover passively
upon dissipation of
checkpoint
signals or require an active participation
by specific effectors. A recent study in the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae uncovered
two previously unsuspected functions
of Cdk1 in efficient
recovery from
the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)
imposed arrest. An inability to fulfil these
requirements in the absence of Cdk1
makes it virtually impossible for cells to
recover from the mitotic arrest. Given
the conserved nature of the SAC, these
findings may have implications for verte-
brate cells.

events is one of the most conspicuous
features of
the eukaryotic cell division

cycle events that tethers them in a tem-
poral order and partly from the negative
regulation imposed by the surveillance
pathways called the checkpoint controls
(or simply checkpoints).1 Checkpoints are
particularly important in situations where
cells fail to initiate or complete an event
appropriately, due either to intracellular
aberrations or an exposure to damage
inducing agents. Such circumstances result
in the activation of checkpoint controls
which prevent the onset of subsequent
events and bring the division cycle to a
grinding halt. These arrest-states can last
for extended periods, giving cells sufficient
time to repair the damage, so that nor-
malcy is restored and cells can resume cell
cycle progression. The DNA damage
‘checkpoint
checkpoint was
control’ to be conceptually defined based
on studies in the budding yeast Saccharo-
myces cerevisiae.1 It
is activated in res-
ponse to DNA damage and causes cells to
arrest in the G2 phase until the damage is
repaired. Subsequent studies, also on the
budding yeast, helped formulate the DNA

assembly checkpoints (SAC).3 While the
replication checkpoint prevents premature
onset of mitosis when replication fork
progression is impeded, the SAC func-
tions during mitosis and monitors the
attachment of duplicated chromosomes
to the mitotic
sister-
chromatid separation can be initiated.
Thus, these checkpoints collectively main-
tain the integrity of the genome through
the division cycles. Consistent with the
fundamental role they serve at the cellular
level, the regulatory schemes and the main
effectors of
the three checkpoints are
evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man.

The general framework in which the
checkpoints operate involves (1) sensing of
the checkpoint stimulus (cellular aberra-
tion or damage)
the
checkpoint (3) execution and maintenance
of the cell cycle arrest (4) switching-off of
the checkpoint after the repair is per-
formed and (5) recovery and resumption
of the cell cycle. While many of these
aspects have been studied in detail for all
the major checkpoints, the mechanics of
recovery from checkpoint-imposed arrest
has
remained largely unexplored. The
reason for this neglect may partly lie in
the presumption that recovery is a passive
process, in that once the repairs are made
and the checkpoint stimulus dissipates,
cells gradually return to the “ground
state”, normalcy is restored and cell cycle
progression is resumed. An assumption
inherent in such a consideration is that
during cell cycle arrest, most facets of the
cellular physiology relevant to the division
cycle are “naturally” in transient suspen-
sion and an active participation by specific
effectors is not required for maintenance
of a cellular state from where cells can
make an efficient return to the cycle.
However,
it is possible that during cell
cycle arrest, the cellular processes, though
relevant to the arrest-state but not directly
regulated by the checkpoint effectors,
may continue to follow their temporal
course. During a prolonged arrest, this
state of dynamics may drive cells to a
physiological state from where recovery
becomes increasingly difficult. In such a
scenario,
it may be imperative for cells
to actively maintain a cellular context
in which a return to normalcy can be
mounted efficiently.

Cdk1-mediated suppression of the trans-

like
Cdc20, is also an unstable protein such
that suppression of its transcription results
in rapid loss of Yox1 protein, which in
turn leads
to sustained Cdc20 expres-
sion. Hence it is a combination of pro-
teolytic destruction and transcription

Cdc20 during the mitotic arrest for an

of Ase1 inhibits its ability to mediate

be hypophosphorylated in cells recovering
from SAC-induced arrest in the absence
of Cdk1. Moreover, expression of phos-
phorylation-resistant Ase1 resulted in
dramatic spindle elongation even in the
presence of Cdk1 and severely compro-
mises the cells’ ability to establish bi-
orientation. Thus, one critical
role of
Cdk1

mediated arrest is to prevent premature
spindle elongation, via phosphorylation of
Ase1, to allow efficient bi-orientation.

In an extension to these investigations,
the study4 also found that a lack of Cdk1
activity during recovery leads to another
major defect. Cells recovering from SAC-
induced arrest in the absence of Cdk1
activity exhibit a precipitous drop in
intracellular levels of the APC activator
Cdc20. Cdc20 is degraded throughout
the cell cycle19 and therefore also during
the SAC-induced arrest. The CDC20
gene must be actively transcribed during
the arrest to maintain a constant level of
Cdc20 protein,20 so that during recovery,
cells can rapidly degrade securin, clearing
the way for dissolution of sister-chromatid
cohesion and progression to anaphase.
CDC20 transcription is under the control
of a transcription repressor Yox121,22 which
keeps Cdc20 levels very low during S
phase. However, upon mitotic onset, Yox1
abundance declines and CDC20 gene is
actively transcribed. This study shows that
Cdk1 negatively regulates YOX1 transcrip-
tion, thus keeping the intracellular levels
of Yox1 low and, in turn, promoting the

Figure 1. Cdk1 in the recovery from spindle assembly checkpoint-mediated arrest. Cdk1 plays two
important roles during the cell’s recovery from SAC-induced arrest in yeast. It (1) prevents untimely
extension of the mitotic spindle to allow efficient establishment of chromosome bi-orientation and
(2) maintains adequate cellular abundance of Cdc20 (required for APC activation) by inhibiting
the transcription of transcriptional repressor YOX1 (see text for details).

an active process. Given that the check-

investigations
into the cellular contexts
