In the USA, small animal veterinary hospitals (SAVHs) commonly keep resident cats living
permanently as pets within their facilities. Previously, multi-drug resistant (MDR) entero-
cocci were found as a contaminant of multiple surfaces within such veterinary hospitals,
and nosocomial infections are a concern. The objectives of this study were to determine
whether resident cats carry MDR enterococci and to compare the feline isolates geno-
typically to those obtained from SAVH surfaces in a previous study. Enterococcal strains
(n = 180) were isolated from the feces of six healthy resident cats from different SAVHs.
The concentration of enterococci ranged from 1.1× 105 to 6.0× 108 CFU g−1 of feces, and
the population comprised Enterococcus hirae (38.3± 18.6%), E. faecium (35.0± 14.3%),
E. faecalis (23.9± 11.0%), and E. avium (2.8± 2.2%). Testing of phenotypic resistance to
14 antimicrobial agents revealed multi-drug resistance (≥3 antimicrobials) in 48.9% of all
enterococcal isolates with most frequent resistance to tetracycline (75.0%), erythromycin
(50.0%), and rifampicin (36.1%). Vancomycin resistant E. faecalis (3.9%) with vanB not
horizontally transferable in in vitro conjugation assays were detected from one cat. Geno-
typing with pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis demonstrated a host-speciﬁc clonal population
of MDR E. faecalis and E. faecium. Importantly, several feline isolates were genotypically
identical or closely related to isolates from surfaces of cage door, thermometer, and stetho-
scope of the corresponding SAVHs. These data demonstrate that healthy resident cats at
SAVHs carry MDR enterococci and likely contribute to contamination of the SAVH environ-
ment. Proper disposal and handling of fecal material and restricted movement of resident
cats within the ward are recommended.

INTRODUCTION
USA households own a large number of dogs (77.5 million) and
cats (93.6 million) as pets (APPA, 2009/2010), leading to an average
of 2–3 veterinary hospital visits per household per year (AVMA,
2007). Due to high trafﬁc with healthy and sick patients and clients
in and out of small animal veterinary hospitals (SAVHs), it is
important to maintain good hygiene of these facilities. Previous
studies have documented bacterial contamination of surfaces in
SAVHs (Aksoy et al., 2010; KuKanich et al., 2012). There are sev-
eral sources that may contribute to this contamination. Frequent
use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine likely results in
the selection of resistant bacteria within the gastrointestinal tract
of patients that can be spread in the hospital environment by fecal
contamination. In addition, in the USA, many SAVHs keep resi-
dent pets that freely move around their premises and could act as
a carrier/reservoir of resistant bacteria. Other possible sources of
contamination include visiting patients, animal owners, hospital
personnel as well as lack of efﬁcient infection control measures.

Although enterococci are commensals in the gut microbiota of
mammals; in the last decades they become one of the important

nosocomial human pathogens (Roberts et al., 2009a). Enterococci
can readily acquire genes leading to increased virulence, antimi-
crobial resistance (Gilmore et al., 2002; Arias and Murray, 2008),
and have the ability to survive on inanimate dry hospital sur-
faces for up to 4 months (Kramer et al., 2006). Therefore, the
appropriate use of disinfectants is critical for maintaining proper
hygiene standards in hospitals and for reducing nosocomial infec-
tions (Hota, 2004). Healthy companion animals have been shown
to carry antimicrobial resistant enterococcal lineages associated
with human infections and thus may be considered a reservoir
shedding these bacteria into the environment (Guardabassi et al.,
2004; Damborg et al., 2009; Jackson et al., 2009a). Our recent
study has revealed that the dogs leaving the veterinary intensive
care unit (ICU) carried a very large population of multi-drug resis-
tant (MDR) enterococci with the capacity for bioﬁlm formation
and horizontal transfer of resistance genes. Furthermore, geno-
typing of canine enterococcal isolates demonstrated that some
of them belonged to the human nosocomial clonal complex-
17 (CC-17) (Ghosh et al., 2011). In small animals, enterococci
have also been implicated in diarrhea, mastitis, urinary tract and

catheter-associated infections, and cholangiohepatitis (Helie and
Higgins, 1999; Manson et al., 2003; Pressel et al., 2005; Marsh-
Ng et al., 2007). With the exception of rare case reports (Boerlin
et al., 2001; Benedict et al., 2008), little is known about the nosoco-
mial potential of enterococci in veterinary medicine. Considering
the previous study documenting MDR and potentially virulent
enterococci in the SAVH environment (KuKanich et al., 2012),
further research is needed to better understand bacterial conta-
mination in order to assess and mitigate nosocomial and public
health risks.

In the current study, we hypothesized that resident cats in
SAVHs acquire and carry antimicrobial resistant enterococci and
play a role in dissemination of antimicrobial resistance traits in
the hospital environment. The objectives of this study were: (1)
to isolate fecal enterococci from six resident cats and to determine
their concentration, diversity, clonality, and phenotypic antimicro-
bial resistance and virulence proﬁles; (2) to compare the clonality
of feline enterococcal isolates to that of isolates from cage doors,
thermometers, and stethoscopes in the corresponding hospitals
(KuKanich et al., 2012).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE COLLECTION, ISOLATION, AND IDENTIFICATION OF
ENTEROCOCCI
Ten privately owned SAVHs (hospitals 1–10) were enrolled in a
previous surveillance study that was conducted to evaluate bacte-
rial contamination on surfaces of cage doors, stethoscopes, ther-
mometers, and mouth gags (KuKanich et al., 2012). As a follow-up
of the surface study, fecal material was collected from six resident
cats (6/10 SAVHs had resident pets) from individual SAVHs. Each
cat was considered healthy by its primary veterinarian. Most cats
had lived at the hospital premise since they were kittens; four
of them had never received any antimicrobial treatment, and the
remaining two were not exposed to antimicrobials for at least
1 year prior to our sampling. Detailed information regarding the
enrolled cats and their diets is in Table A1 in Appendix. This study
was given exempt status from the institutional animal care and
use committee because it did not involve any direct contact with
animals.

Fresh feces were collected from the litter box and one gram of
the feces was re-suspended in 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline
(PBS, pH 7.2; MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). A 100 μl of the
suspension was plated in triplicate on mEnterococcus agar (Difco,
BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA), and presumptive ente-
rococcal colonies were selected and conﬁrmed at the genus level as
described previously (Macovei and Zurek, 2007). Identiﬁcation at
the species level was carried out for randomly selected 30 isolates
per fecal sample using species-speciﬁc multiplex PCR (Kariyama
et al., 2000) or sequencing of the manganese-dependent superox-
ide dismutase gene (sodA) (Poyaert et al., 2000). The concentration
of enterococci for each sample was calculated in CFU per gram of
feces. In order to assess whether the cat diets are the source of
MDR enterococci, three out of six commercially available cat diets
fed to individual cats were sampled and tested. Two grams of dry
food were re-suspended in 20 ml PBS and 100 μl of the suspension
was plated on mEnterococcus agar and incubated for 48 h in 37˚C.

ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING AND HORIZONTAL GENE
TRANSFER
The identiﬁed isolates were tested for their susceptibility to antimi-
crobials commonly used in veterinary medicine as well as those
targeting human enterococcal infections. Antimicrobial suscepti-
bility was determined by the disk diffusion method on Mueller-
Hinton agar (Difco, BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA)
−1): ampicillin (10), tetra-
using 10 antimicrobial agents (μg disk
cycline (30), doxycycline (30), gentamicin (120), erythromycin
(15), enroﬂoxacin (5), vancomycin (30), quinupristin/dalfopristin
(15), nitrofurantoin (300), and tigecycline (15). Agar dilution
technique was carried out to determine resistance to the fol-
−1): streptomycin (2,000) on brain
lowing antimicrobials (μg ml
heart infusion agar (BBL, BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD,
USA) and chloramphenicol (16), rifampicin (24), and linezolid
(8) on Mueller-Hinton agar. Minimum inhibitory concentration
−1, in double fold incre-
(MIC) for vancomycin (8–256 μg ml
−1, in double fold incre-
ments) and teicoplanin (0.25–8 μg ml
ments) was determined for vancomycin resistant isolates by broth
microdilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth (BBL, BD
Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA; CLSI, 2008, 2010). Rou-
tine quality control of antimicrobial disks was performed using
control strains of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433 and E. fae-
cium ATCC 19434. Diameters of zones of inhibition were inter-
preted in accordance with guidelines of the Clinical and Lab-
oratory Standards Institute for Enterococcus spp. (CLSI, 2008,
2010). The breakpoint for tigecycline is according to manu-
facturer speciﬁcations upon recommendation from the CLSI.
Antimicrobial breakpoints for enterococcal species are not all vet-
erinary approved and are therefore not validated in relation to
clinical outcome in a veterinary application. Multi-drug resis-
tance was deﬁned as resistance to three or more antimicrobial
agents, regardless of class. Linear regression analysis was per-
formed to compare the antimicrobial resistance proﬁles of each
enterococcal species from all animals and animals with no antimi-
crobial treatment. The antimicrobial resistance proﬁles of feline
isolates were also compared to that of the isolates from hos-
pital surfaces from our previous work (KuKanich et al., 2012)
although in that study the isolates were not screened for resis-
tance to tetracycline, streptomycin,
linezolid, rifampicin, and
chloramphenicol.

PCR ampliﬁcation of vanA and vanB genes was conducted
with primers described previously (Kariyama et al., 2000; Elsayed
et al., 2001). Broth and ﬁlter conjugation assays were carried out
as described by Ike et al. (1998) and Tendolkar et al. (2006),
respectively to determine the mobility of the vancomycin resis-
tance trait among E. faecalis strains. The recipients included
the following strains with resistance markers: 41–31 (linezolid,
MIC= 8 μg ml
−1; Qi et al., 2006), OG1SSp (spectinomycin,
MIC= 250 μg ml
−1; Dunny et al., 1982), and JH2-2 (rifampicin,
MIC= 30 μg ml
−1; Oancea et al., 2004). Both assays were per-
formed with a donor and recipient ratio of 1:10. The transcon-
jugants were detected on agar supplemented with vancomycin
−1) and the respective antimicrobial markers of the
(16 μg ml
recipient strains with the same antimicrobial concentrations as
described above.

SCREENING FOR VIRULENCE TRAITS BY PHENOTYPE
Identiﬁed isolates were tested for the gelatinase on Todd Hewitt
Agar (Difco, BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA) with 1.5%
skim milk, and for the cytolysin (β-hemolysis) on Columbia blood
agar base (Difco, BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA) sup-
plemented with 5.0% human blood (Rockland Immunochemicals,
Inc., Gilbertsville, PA, USA) as described previously (Macovei and
Zurek, 2006).

GENOTYPING BY PULSED-FIELD GEL ELECTROPHORESIS
The feline enterococcal isolates (E. faecalis, n = 15; E. faecium,
n = 18) for pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were selected
based on their different antibiotic resistance proﬁle. These were
genotyped to assess their clonality within and between cats. Also,
in this study, nine E. faecalis isolates from various hospital sur-
faces were genotyped and compared with the feline isolates while
the feline E. faecium isolates were compared to the 42 E. faecium
hospital isolates typed in our previous study (KuKanich et al.,
2012). PFGE was carried out following the protocols of Murray
et al. (1990) and Turabelidze et al. (2000). Brieﬂy, agarose plugs
were restriction digested with 20U of SmaI (New England Biolab,
Ipswich, MA, USA) for 4 h at 25˚C. Digested plugs were run on
to a 1.0% SeaKem Gold Agarose (Lonza, Rockland, ME, USA) gel
using CHEF Mapper (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA)
with initial pulse time for 1 s and ﬁnal time for 20 s at 200 V for
21 h. Cluster analysis was performed with BioNumerics (Applied
Maths, Inc., Austin, TX, USA) by using the band-based Dice cor-
relation coefﬁcient and the unweighted pair group mathematical
average algorithm (UPGMA) with position tolerance setting of
1.0% for both optimization and band comparison. The cut off
95% was used to classify the strains as clonal.

RESULTS
ENTEROCOCCAL CONCENTRATION AND SPECIES DIVERSITY
The mean enterococcal concentration was 1.1± 0.7× 106 CFU g
−1
that had
of
6.0× 108 CFU g
−1 (Table 1). There was great variation in ente-
rococcal composition at the species level among individual cats
(Table 1). Altogether, of the 180 isolates, E. hirae (69/180,
38.3± 18.6%) was the most common, followed by E. faecium
(63/180, 35.0± 14.3%), E. faecalis (43/180, 23.9± 11.0%), and E.

cats, with one outlying cat

avium (5/180, 2.8± 2.2%). No enterococcal colonies were detected
in the cat diets.

ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE AND VIRULENCE
Eighty-eight out of 180 enterococcal isolates (48.9%) from feces
of the enrolled healthy cats showed multi-drug resistance (3–8
antimicrobials; Table 2). Overall, E. faecium exhibited high inci-
dence of resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, and enroﬂoxacin
while resistance to rifampicin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, doxycy-
cline, ampicillin, gentamicin, streptomycin, and nitrofurantoin
was less frequent (Figure 1). E. faecalis was frequently resis-
tant to a total of six different antimicrobials, namely rifampicin,
erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, doxycycline, and strep-
tomycin whereas resistance to vancomycin, and chlorampheni-
col was less common (Figure 1). A considerable number of E.
hirae were resistant to tetracycline, rifampicin, and erythromycin
(Figure 1). Five isolates of E. avium showed resistance to
rifampicin, erythromycin, and/or tetracycline (Table A2 in Appen-
dix). No resistance was detected to the newer generation drugs,
linezolid and tigecycline, in any enterococcal isolates. The antimi-
crobial resistance proﬁle for cats that had never been administered
antimicrobial agents is depicted in Figure A1 in Appendix. Based
on statistical analysis, antimicrobial resistance proﬁles of ente-
rococcal species from all cats and cats with no antimicrobial
treatment were highly similar [R = 0.9458 (E. faecalis), R = 0.9764
(E. faecium), and R = 0.9844 (E. hirae)].

Isolates from feces of individual cats provided a unique pro-
ﬁle of antimicrobial resistance. In cat-A, 8 out of 11 E. faecium
were resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, and several were resis-
tant to high level of streptomycin (4/11), doxycycline (3/11), and
nitrofurantoin (3/11; Table A2 in Appendix). E. faecalis strains
(5/15) resistant to chloramphenicol and high level of gentam-
icin were also detected in the feces of this cat. In cat-D, the
enterococcal population in the gut was almost equally shared
by MDR strains of E. faecalis (11/30), E. hirae (10/30), and
E. faecium (9/30). Among these, all E. faecalis were phenotyp-
ically resistant to six antimicrobials (tetracycline, doxycycline,
erythromycin, rifampicin, gentamicin, and streptomycin) whereas
one E. faecium strain was resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin,
enroﬂoxacin, rifampicin, and streptomycin (Table 2; Table A2
in Appendix). Cat-E was colonized with MDR E. faecalis (7/30)

failed to transfer vanB from the feline isolates to several E. fae-
calis recipient strains. Besides vancomycin, these E. faecalis were
also resistant to high level of gentamicin and erythromycin. In
addition, all E. faecium from cat-E displayed resistance to 8 antimi-
crobials (tetracycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, enroﬂoxacin,
quinupristin/dalfopristin, rifampicin, gentamicin, and ampicillin;
Table 2, Table A2 in Appendix). Cat-B was colonized with E.
faecium (24/30) resistant to enroﬂoxacin, erythromycin, and tetra-
cycline. E. hirae from cat-C were resistant to tetracycline (27/30)
while those from cat-F were resistant to tetracycline (25/30) and
rifampicin (5/30) (Table A2 in Appendix).

All feline isolates were screened for two enterococcal viru-
lence factors, gelatinase and cytolysin. The majority of E. faecalis
(38/43, 88.4%) showed strong gelatinase phenotype, and several
(5/43, 11.6%) were β-hemolytic on human blood agar. E. faecium
(58/63, 92.1%) and E. hirae (66/69, 95.6%) showed weak gelatinase

phenotype; the remainder were negative for gelatinase activity and
none were β-hemolytic.

GENOTYPING OF FELINE ENTEROCOCCAL ISOLATES
Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that enterococ-
cal isolates from individual cats were host-speciﬁc clonal groups
(unique pulsotypes in individual cats; Figures 2A,B). The feline
enterococcal isolates were also compared to the surface isolates
from the corresponding hospitals (Figure 2A; KuKanich et al.,
2012). E. faecalis from a cage door of Hospital-6 showed close
genotypic similarity (96.9%) to several fecal isolates from the cat
(cat-D) residing at the facility (Figure 2A). Furthermore, two E.
faecium strain from feces of cat-A were clonally indistinguishable
or closely related (96.9%) to isolates from the surfaces (a cage door,
a stethoscope, and a thermometer) of Hospital-1 (KuKanich et al.,
2012).

Antimicrobial resistance in veterinary cats

DISCUSSION
With large numbers of pet animals in the USA, maintaining a
healthy environment within SAVHs is highly desirable. Recent
studies have reported surface contamination by MDR entero-
cocci and other bacteria in SAVH environment (Aksoy et al., 2010;
KuKanich et al., 2012). Our study was designed to assess healthy
resident cats in SAVHs as carriers/reservoirs of MDR enterococci.
The mean value of enterococcal population size in resident cats
was comparable to that reported from the feces of healthy pets
−1 of feces) (Damborg et al., 2009). Though the
(103–106 CFU g
enterococcal species composition was diverse among individual
cats, the overall diversity at the species level indicated a healthy
feline gut microbiota and was in congruence with other studies
on enterococcal population in healthy cats (Devriese et al., 1992;
de Leener et al., 2005). Previously, Poeta et al. (2006) reported
an intermediate prevalence of resistance in enterococci with few
MDR strains isolated from healthy cats in Portugal. de Leener et al.
(2005) and Moyaert et al. (2006) screened cats from diverse popu-
lations in Belgium and demonstrated that enterococcal strains in
cats from hospitals and catteries had relatively higher prevalence of
resistance to several antimicrobial agents (erythromycin, tylosin,
lincomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin) com-
pared to that of healthy domestic cats. In the USA, Jackson et al.
(2009a) reported antimicrobial resistant E. faecium and E. fae-
calis from a total of 116 healthy cats visiting veterinary clinics.
They detected MDR E. faecalis and E. faecium (3–8 antimicrobials)
but no vancomycin or quinupristin/dalfopristin resistant strains.
Our results showed that four out of six healthy cats harbored a
MDR enterococcal population with E. faecium occurring most
frequently. To our knowledge, our study reported for the ﬁrst time
MDR (tetracycline, erythromycin, and rifampicin) E. hirae from
a healthy companion animal. All of our enterococcal isolates were
susceptible to the relatively new antimicrobial agents linezolid and
tigecycline, and this is in agreement with the study of Jackson et al.
(2009a). Importantly, the overall antimicrobial resistance proﬁle
of the isolates from our healthy resident cats was similar to that
of cattery and hospitalized feline isolates rather than the isolates
from healthy domestic cats.

Due to limited number of animals and bacterial isolates, we
could not assess a correlation between the antimicrobials admin-
istered to resident cats and antimicrobial resistance proﬁles of the
feline enterococcal isolates. Clearly, three out of four cats that have
never been administered antimicrobials carried a MDR enterococ-
cal population. Vice versa, feces of one of the two cats that received
an antimicrobial treatment had the enterococcal community sus-
ceptible to all antibiotics tested with the exception of tetracycline.
While enterococci are not commonly associated with infections in
small animals, due to their ability to horizontally transfer resistance
traits to other bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus (Noble
et al., 1992; Clewell and Dunny, 2002; Weigel et al., 2003), the ente-
rococcal resistance reported in this study is important especially
that to doxycycline, enroﬂoxacin, and ampicillin. This is because
tetracyclines, ﬂuoroquinolones, and β-lactams are very commonly
used in small animal veterinary medicine to treat various bacter-
ial infections (Prescott et al., 2002). Due to close physical contact
between pets and people, the likelihood of transfer of bacteria
is very high and it has been demonstrated for different bacterial

taxa including enterococci and staphylococci (Simjee et al., 2002;
Guardabassi et al., 2004; Bramble et al., 2011; Chomel and Sun,
2011). Once established in the digestive tract, MDR enterococci
can persist for months to years (Byers et al., 2002; Sørum et al.,
2006). Detection of chloramphenicol resistant E. faecalis and quin-
upristin/dalfopristin resistant E. faecium requires attention since
these antimicrobials are used to treat human infections caused by
vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) (Lautenbach et al., 1998;
Linden et al., 2001; Arias and Murray, 2008). We also report van-
comycin resistant E. faecalis with the vanB gene not transferable
in vitro; however, transfer of this trait in natural niches cannot be
ruled out. van Belkum et al. (1996) reported that 4/24 (16%) of
the rectal swabs from cats that attended a veterinary practice in the
Netherlands were positive for vancomycin resistant E. faecium with
vanA. Another study reported association of vancomycin resistant
E. faecium in a cat with cholangiohepatitis (Pressel et al., 2005). To
our knowledge, isolation of vancomycin resistant E. faecalis from
a healthy cat in our study is the ﬁrst of its kind. Interestingly, VRE
were not detected in our previous surveillance study (KuKanich
et al., 2012) and this antibiotic is also typically not used to treat ani-
mals at SAVHs (Weese, 2008). Although the source of VRE in this
cat is unknown, it is likely of a human (pet owner, hospital staff)
origin since VRE strains are rare in the USA outside of the human
clinical environment (Sapkota et al., 2007; Roberts et al., 2009b).
The VRE transfer from personnel in human hospitals to patients
as well as between pet owners and pets has been suggested in sev-
eral studies (Hayden, 2000; Guardabassi et al., 2004; Tacconelli and
Cataldo, 2008) and it is therefore also possible in SAVHs. Resis-
tance to ampicillin and high level of gentamicin in E. faecium is also
a concern, as gentamicin in combination with β-lactams or gly-
copeptides is typically used to treat human enterococcal infections
(Arias and Murray, 2008).

Gelatinase and cytolysin are among the virulence traits impli-
cated in enhancement of enterococcal infections (Gilmore et al.,
2002). Gulhan et al. (2006) demonstrated that prevalence of gelati-
nase and cytolytic activity among E. faecalis and E. faecium were
negligible in healthy cats. In contrast, the presence of gelatinolytic
as well as several β-hemolytic strains of E. faecalis isolated from
the healthy resident cats in our study indicates these isolates
have increased virulence potentially resulting in bioﬁlm formation
(Ghosh et al., 2011), proliferation in bloodstream, and direct tissue
damage (Gilmore et al., 2002). Therefore, our data demonstrate
that resident cats in SAVHs are carriers and possible reservoirs
of antimicrobial resistant and potentially virulent enterococcal
strains. Since fecal samples of these cats were not tested prior
to their adoption as resident cats (as kittens), we cannot entirely
exclude a rather remote possibility that the cats in this study
acquired the enterococci from an outside source before their stay
in SAVHs.

Sharing of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) clones
among hospital staff, surfaces, patients, and resident animals had
been documented in a veterinary hospital (Loefﬂer et al., 2005)
as well as in a human geriatric ward (Scott et al., 1988) indicat-
ing cross-contamination within the hospital environment. In our
study, clonal matches based on PFGE clearly demonstrate cross-
contamination between the resident cats and the hospital environ-
ment although the directionality of the bacterial transfer requires

further investigation. The PFGE dendrograms also revealed that
feline enterococcal isolates in our study were host-speciﬁc (unique
to individual cats) and not diverse although genotyping of more
isolates is warranted to assess the diversity to a greater extent.
These ﬁndings differ from the study by Jackson et al. (2009b)
where they found that healthy domestic cats harbored MDR ente-
rococcal strains of diverse clonal origin. We hypothesize that the
antimicrobial use in the SAVHs leads to the selection of speciﬁc
MDR clonal lineages in the patients that contaminate the hospi-
tal environment. Consequently, this contamination becomes the
source of MDR enterococci for the resident cats that then become
carriers/reservoirs of these bacteria and possibly re-contaminate
the hospital environment. The cat diet is an unlikely source of the
antimicrobial resistant enterococci as all resident cats enrolled in
this study were fed commercial cat food (Table A1 in Appendix)
and our random screening of these diets failed to detect any ente-
rococcal contamination. Other possible sources of antimicrobial
resistant enterococci such as the hospital staff or pet owners cannot
be ruled out.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that resident cats in SAVHs
in the USA can carry and shed MDR enterococci and this
may create risk to people and animals within veterinary hos-
pitals. Further research is warranted to determine direction
of enterococcal transmission between resident cats and envi-
ronmental surfaces of
the clinics, and also to evaluate the
duration (transient or long-lasting) of such carriage. Nonethe-
less, proper disposal and handling of fecal material of resi-
dent cats, good overall hygiene, effective infection control, and
restricted movement of
these animals within the ward are
recommended.

Antimicrobial resistance in veterinary cats

FIGURE A1 | Antimicrobial resistance proﬁle of enterococcal
isolates from the feces of four resident cats from small animal
veterinary hospitals that had never been administered any
antimicrobial agents. AM, ampicillin; CM, chloramphenicol; TET,
tetracycline; D, doxycycline; GM, gentamicin; STR, streptomycin; RIF,

rifampicin; E, erythromycin; ENO, enroﬂoxacin; VA, vancomycin; Q/D,
quinupristin/dalfopristin; LIN, linezolid; NF, nitrofurantoin; TGC,
tigecycline; c, number of cats that contributed for the total number (n)
of isolates. *Not applicable for E. faecalis isolates due to their intrinsic
resistance.
