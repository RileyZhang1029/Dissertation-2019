Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation form a major post-translation mechanism that enables a given cell to respond 
to ever-changing internal and external environments. Neurons, similarly to any other cells, use protein phosphorylation/
dephosphorylation to maintain an internal homeostasis, but they also use it for updating the state of synaptic and intrinsic 
properties, following activation by neurotransmitters and growth factors. In the present review we focus on the roles of several 
families of kinases, phosphatases, and other synaptic-plasticity-related proteins, which activate membrane receptors and various 
intracellular signals to promote transcription, translation and protein degradation, and to regulate the appropriate cellular 
proteomes required for taste memory acquisition, consolidation and maintenance. Attention is especially focused on the protein 
phosphorylation state in two forebrain areas that are necessary for taste-memory learning and retrieval:the insular cortex and the 
amygdala.Th  e various temporal phases of taste learning require the activation of appropriate waves of biochemical signals.Th  ese 
include: extracellular signal regulated kinase I and II (ERKI/II) signal transduction pathways; Ca2+-dependent pathways;tyrosine 
kinase/phosphatase-dependent pathways; brain-derived neurotrophicfactor (BDNF)-dependent pathways; cAMP-responsive 
element bindingprotein (CREB); and translation-regulation factors, such as initiation and elongation factors,and the mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mTOR). Interestingly, coding of hedonic and aversive taste information in the forebrain requires activation of 
diff erent signal transduction pathways.

commonly used taste-memory models are taste preference, 
conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and latent inhibition of 
conditioned taste aversion (LI-CTA). Th  e consumption of a novel 
taste that is not associated with negative visceral consequences 
leads to the formation of a non-associative form of sensory 
memory, known as incidental taste memory. Habituation followed 
by exposure to a novel taste, choice preference, and attenuation of 
neophobia are the models that are most widely used to decipher 
incidental taste learning and memory. CTA is an associative 
learning paradigm; by means of CTA, organisms learn to avoid a

novel food substance (conditioned stimulus, CS) associated with 
delayed poisoning (unconditioned stimulus, US) [1-3]. CTA can 
be acquired in a single trial and it differs from other associative 
paradigms in the long delay between CS and US. In LI-CTA, a 
novel taste (CS) is learned days before a CTA trial, and it results in 
retarded performance of a CTA task; a positive tag of the learned 
taste is established and, consequently, weaker aversion is expressed 
[4, 5]. Experimentally, following 3 days of restricted access to water, 
animals sample novel taste solution. Since animals learn novel taste 
without any negative visceral consequence, they both remember 
the taste as incidental memory (i.e. no UCS) but also learn that the 
taste is safe. Whereas in CTA, lithium chloride (0.05~0.15 M) is 
injected 40 minutes aft er the drinking session (UCS), which elicits 
gastric pain and incomfort and therefore animals learn the given 
taste as an aversive one. The most commonly used novel taste is 
saccharin (0.1~0.5% w/v in plain tap water) and sodium chloride 
(0.1~0.5% w/v also in plain tap water) [4, 5]. 
There is extensive overlapping between the gustatory neural 
circuits associated with the acquisition and expression of novel-
taste and aversive-taste memories. The neural circuitry of taste 
learning includes the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST, also 
known as nucleus of tractus solitarius - NTS), the parabrachial 
nucleus (PBN), the parvocellular part of the ventralis postmedial 
thalamic nucleus of the thalamus (pVPMpc), the nucleus basalis 
magnocellularis (NBM), the amygdala (AMY) and the insular 
cortex (IC) [5-7]. Recent findings indicate that the nucleus 
accumbens (NAcc), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and perirhinal 
cortex (PC) also participate in taste-memory formation [8-16]. 
Although the hippocampus (HIP) has been shown to be involved 
in several forms of learning, its involvement in taste learning 
is unclear. Hippocampal lesion studies in the past decade have 
yielded inconclusive results regarding the role of the HIP in taste 
learning and CTA [17-23]. Recent studies demonstrated that the 
HIP is necessary for the consolidation of attenuation of neophobia 
[16], and inhibition of protein synthesis in the HIP impairs 
consolidation of CTA extinction [24]. Interestingly, another study 
indicated thatvarious molecular pathways were activated in the 
HIP and in the IC, during diff erent temporal windows following 
novel taste learning [25]. Clearly, further studies are required to 
identify and define the role of the HIP in taste learning. Many 
studies have shown that the IC and AMY are highly involved in 
taste-memory formation, consolidation and retrieval, therefore, 
in this review we will focus on delineating the prominent role of 
protein phosphorylation in taste learning in these two temporal 
lobe structures.

GENE EXPRESSION AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS

Memory consolidation, a progressive process of post-acquisition 
stabilization that facilitates the permanent storage of memory, is 
dependent on the gene expression and synthesis of new proteins 
within the relevant brain structures. Recent studies elucidated the 
mechanisms of gene expression and the regulation of translation 
that underlies taste memory consolidation.
Phosphorylation of the transcription factor, cAMP-response 
element-binding protein (CREB) on serine 133 causes it to bind 
the cAMP response element (CRE), which is then bound to a 
CREB-binding protein (CBP). This complex, in turn, leads the 
CREB to turn the transcription of certain geneson oroff [26], 
and CREB has been shown to be phosphorylated directly by 
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Ca2+/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase IV,and indirectly by the extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERKI/II) cascade through activation 
of RSK2, which is a member of the pp90rsk family of S6 kinases 
[27, 28]. Novel-taste learning increased CREB phosphorylation 
in the HIP but, interestingly, not in the IC [25], whereas intra-
peritoneal (i.p.) injection of LiCl (as a US) increased CREB 
activation in the IC [29]. Moreover, CTA conditioning increased 
CREB activation in the lateral septum, lateral amygdala (LA) and 
IC [29, 30]. Phosphorylated CREB activated the transcription of 
many genes, including c-Fos, brain-derived neurotropic factor 
(BDNF), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPβ) [31, 
32]. BDNF stimulated CREB phosphorylation, and this CREB 
phosphorylation played a central role in mediating the BDNF 
response [32]. CTA conditioning was correlated with increased 
expression of BDNF protein from 4 to 12 h after conditioning 
in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), and from 8 to 
12 h after conditioning in the IC [33]. Ma et al. [33] also have 
shown that association of novel taste and malaise was essential 
for BDNF signalling to be involved in taste learning.This is 
consistent with previous studies, which found no changes in 
CREB phosphorylation in the IC following novel-taste learning 
[25], and activation of CREB in the LA only following CTA [29]. 
Moreover, novel-taste consumption and association of novel taste 
with malaise in CTA learning elicited increased expression levels 
of c-Fos - an immediate early gene whose expression is mediated 
by CREB - in the CeA and IC [34-36]. Furthermore, activation of 
c-Fos in the IC and AMY has been found to be required for CTA 
memory formation [15, 37]. These particular examples clearly 
suggest that some proteins, e.g., BDNF, that are implicated in taste 
memory consolidation are mainly related to the consolidation of 
CS-US association with CTA and not to CS or US exposure alone.

Phosphorylation and Taste Learning

AMY, particularly in the CeA, has been shown to impair CTA 
memory [38], and CREB mutant mice have also been found to be 
impaired in CTA memory [39], which suggests that the activity of 
CREB is vital for CTA memory formation. 
Another transcription factor that was induced in correlation with 
taste learning is C/EBPβ, which also has been associated with HIP-
dependent learning processes [40-42]. Yefet et al. [25] have found 
increased expression levels of C/EBPβ protein 18 h following 
novel-taste consumption; furthermore, it is interesting thatfurther 
study demonstrated that this correlative induction of C/EBPβ 
could be deleted if another novel taste was consumed 4 h aft er the 
fi rst one, i.e. retrograde amnesia [43], which suggests that a long 
process of biochemical changes leads to the increased expression 
of the proteins required for taste-memory consolidation. 
Modifi cation of the chromatin structure can facilitate function-
ing of transcription factors. Lysine acetylation of histones alters 
the higher-order chromatin structure and exposes DNA to 
transcription processes. Novel-taste consumption has been shown 
to be associated with increased activity of histone acetyl transferase 
in the IC [44]. Moreover, this increased lysine acetylation 
of p42Ack and p55Ack proteins appears to be at least partly 
downstream of activation of ERKI/II in the IC [44], which suggests 
that novel-taste consumption enhances the chromatin structural 
reorganization and thereby leads to increased transcription. 
Memory consolidation is generally considered to be a progressive 
stabilization process that requires the synthesis of new proteins. 
Indeed, pharmacological studies based on the protein-synthesis 
inhibitor, anisomycin demonstrated the general requirement 
for protein synthesis in novel-taste learning and CTA memory 
consolidation [4, 45-47]. 
Translation is the mechanism by which the relevant neurons fi ne-
tune the levels of proteins in both time and space. Th  e translation 
process includes three distinct phases: initiation, elongation, and 
termination. The primary target for translation regulation is the 
initiation phase, therefore, key roles in controlling translation are 
played by translation initiation factors through phosphorylation 
of the various initiation factors and ribosomal proteins [48, 49]. 
Novel-taste learning enhances the phosphorylation of ribosomal 
protein S6 kinase1 (S6K1) on threonine 389 [50], whereas this 
phosphorylation was positively correlated with enhanced initiation 
of translation [51]. Interestingly, within the same temporal 
window, there was an increase in the phosphorylation of a 
eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF2) [50] - whose phosphorylation 
correlates with a general reduction of the elongation process in 
translation - on threonine 56 [52-54]. Th  ese results indicate that 
although novel-taste consumption increases the general initiation 
of translation, it decreases the elongation rate. On the assumption 

that the processes take place in the same cell, it is reasonable to 
suggest that during taste-memory consolidation, in spite of the 
general increase in the initiation phase of translation, elongation 
becomes the rate-limiting step allowingonly of poorly initiated 
mRNAs for further translation [50]. This distinct population of 
mRNAs consists of plasticity-related mRNAs, such as C/EBPβ [25]. 
Another hub molecule in translation control is mammalian 
target of rapamycin-sensitive kinase (mTOR). Phosphorylated 
mTOR on serine 2448 can regulate several downstream elements 
of the translation machinery, including S6K1 and eukaryotic 
elongation factors 1A and 2 (eEF1A and eEF2) [55]. Novel-taste 
learning induced a correlative activation of mTOR in a biphasic 
pattern, at 15 min and 3h following novel-taste learning [56]. 
Moreover, phosphorylation of S6K1 has also been shown to be 
increased within the same temporal window [56]. Biochemical 
fractionation analysis revealed that phosphorylation of S6K1 was 
increased in a synaptoneurosomal preparation at 15 min but not 
at 3 h following novel-taste learning, indicating the importance 
of spatial segregation of signaling molecules during taste-
memory formation. Unlike general protein synthesis inhibitors 
such as anisomycin and cycloheximide, rapamycin selectively 
inhibits the translation of certain populations of mRNAsthat 
contain an oligo-pyrimidine tract at their transcriptional start 
(5’TOP), most notably mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and 
elongation factors [57, 58]. Inhibition of mTOR by microinjection 
of rapamycin locally into the IC reduced expression of eEF1A 
and post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), reduced S6K1 
phosphorylation, and increased eEF2 phosphorylation;at the same 
time, this inhibition of mTOR in the IC attenuated long-term 
taste memory as analyzed by LI-CTA paradigm [56]. Th  ese results 
support the notion that there is a selective control of translation of 
proteins during taste-memory consolidation. 
Behavioral analyses of transgenic mice with specific modifi-
cations in the translation machinery revealed clear attenuation 
of taste memory (Table 1): S6K1 knock-out mice showed clear 
attenuation of taste memory [59]; the mutant mice that lacked 
the translation repressor, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding 
protein (4E-BP2) exhibited enhanced formation of the eIF4F 
complex, and analysis of taste learning in these mice revealed no 
change in taste recognition, but enhanced CTA learning [60]. 
Similarly, mice with reduced phosphorylation of eukaryotic 
initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) exhibited enhanced taste learning, 
but no eff ect on taste recognition [61]. 
Protein degradation in parallel with protein synthesis regulates 
the proper turnover of proteins and the quality of the cellular 
proteome. The ubiquitin- proteasome system (UPS), and 
lysosome- and proteases-mediated proteolysis are the main

routes of protein degradation. Whereas the lysosome accounts 
for protein turnover of ~20% in cells [62], the UPS is highly 
conserved and serves as a principal means of targeting proteins 
for degradation [63, 64]. Pharmacological and genetic studies that 
demonstrated the relationship between the UPS and several forms 
of learning and memory have been reviewed extensively [63-65]. 
Briefl y, pharmacological inhibition of the UPS in the HIP blocked 
long-term memory formation in a one-trial inhibitory avoidance 
task and in a Morris water-maze task, and prevented extinction 
of contextual fear memory [66-68]. In addition, increased protein 
ubiquitination and 26S proteasome tryptic-like activity have been 
observed 4 h following a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task in 
the HIP [66]. Similarly, polyubiquitinated postsynaptic proteins 
such as shank and GKAP were increased in the HIP 1 h after 
retrieval of contextual fear memory [68]. Taken together, these 
fi ndings indicate that, in addition to gene expression and protein 
synthesis, the degradation of proteins may be equally important 
for long-term memory formation. Bilateral microinjection of 
the UPS inhibitor, lactacystin into both the IC and the AMY 
appeared to impair the CTA memory; however, the cellular events 
and mechanisms, and the temporal activity of the lactacystin 
underlying this behavioral phenotype have not been clearly 
described [69].

PROTEIN KINASES AND PHOSPHATASES

Important kinases that are well documented in the field of 
learning and memory processes are: ERKI/II, Ca2+/phospholipid-
dependent protein kinase (PKC), PKA, and Ca2+/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Within the scope of the 
present review, we will focus on the rolesof these fourpathways in 
taste learning and memory. 
Activation of ERKI/II - a serine/threonine kinase with the two 
isoforms ERKI/II (p42/44) belonging to the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) family of signal cascades - is necessary for 

several forms of learning and memory. Several lines of evidence 
showed activation of ERKI/II by phosphorylation on threonine 
202/ tyrosine 204, following novel taste learning [44, 50, 70, 71]. 
However, the temporal window of the activation is not clear; for 
example, several studies have shown activation of ERKI/II in 
the IC a few minutes after novel-taste consumption, but found 
it undetectable after more than 1 h [25, 50, 70, 71]. However, 
Swank and Sweatt [44] have found sustained activation of ERKI/
II lasting between 2 and 6 h, accompanied by a second wave of 
activation in the IC at 24 and 48 h following novel-taste learning 
in mice. Interestingly, when diff erences in the activation of ERKI/
II are observed in diff erent studies, there is a tendency to attribute 
them to differences among the experimental setups. The studies 
that demonstrated immediate and transient activation of ERKI/
II have all used the rat model with water as a control [25, 50, 
70, 71], whereas Swank and Sweatt [44] used the mouse model 
with a time point of zero as a control. It is also important to note 
that most of the studies, including those that observed transient 
activation of ERKI/II, used novel taste in the form of solutions 
such as saccharin, NaCl, etc., but Swank and Sweatt [44] used 
blueberry bar, a solid taste source, thus indicating that the texture 
and the odor of the food, as well as its taste, also plays a key role 
in taste learning and memory. Further examination revealed 
phosphorylation of ELK-1 - a substrate of activated ERKI/II - 
concomitant with muscarinic and N-methy-D-aspartate receptor 
(NMDAR) activation in the IC, following novel-taste learning 
[70]. As shown in Table 2, novel-taste learning also increased the 
phosphorylation and activation of several members of the MAPK 
pathway, such as Raf on serine 259, MEK on serine 217/221, 
p90RSK on serine 381, and Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) 
[44, 70]. It has also been shown that consumption of a given novel 
taste for the second time, but not for the fourth time increased 
ERKI/II activation. Th  ese results indicate that ERKI/II activity in 
the IC is no longer signifi cant once a taste has become familiar [44, 
70].

As in the IC, novel taste learning activates ERKI/II in the 
LA also [29]. Interestingly, i.p. injection of LiCl increased the 
activation of ERKI/II in the CeA [29,72]. CTA conditioning 
was found to increase activation of ERKI/II in the LA and IC 
[29,72]. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK, an upstream kinase 
of ERKI/II, in the IC or AMY attenuated CTA memory [70, 72]. 
Interestingly, the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP), a 
neural model of learning and memory, in the IC was found to 
be ERKI/II-dependent [73]. As in other behavioral paradigms 
and brain regions, ERKI/II activation is highly correlated with 
taste learning, probably mainly during the consolidation phase of 
learning. As mentioned elsewhere [3, 5], the upstream mechanism 
of ERKI/II activation has been extensively studied, but the 
downstream targets of activated ERKI/II during taste learning, 
and especially during consolidation, remain elusive. One of the 
major roles of activated ERKI/II is its involvement in translation 
regulation [74]. As shown in Fig. 1, activated ERKI/II enhances 
the transcription via CREB and translation of synaptic-plasticity-
related proteins directly through its downstream kinases during 
taste learning and memory. 
PKC comprises a family of serine/threonine kinases that has 
been reported to be necessary in the IC, AMY and PBN for 
formation of a CTA memory [75-77]. Injection of US elicited 
PKC enzyme activity in the membrane-bound fraction in the 
PBN and, furthermore, CTA conditioning increased the activity 
of PKC persistently for 48 h in the PBN [78, 79]. However, 
despite the identification and characterization of 11 previously 

known PKC isoforms, the functional role of each isoform in taste 
learning is not clear, and the temporal activities of PKC in the IC 
and AMY remain to be identified. A constitutively active PKC 
isoform M zeta (PKMζ) has been shown to be important for LTP 
maintenance and HIP dependent long-term memory (Sacktor, 
2011). Pharmacological inhibition or lentivirally mediated over-
expression of PKMζ led, respectively, to erasure or enhancement 
of long-term CTA memory [80-83]. PKMζ expression was 
increased in the IC 2 weeks aft er CTA conditioning - a fi nding that 
correlated with the long-term CTA memory [82]. Interestingly, 
application of the PKMζ inhibitor, ZIP into the AMY 15 min 
before US association, but not 30 min after CTA conditioning, 
attenuated CTA memory [84]. Taken together, these results 
reveal the importance of PKMζ in the early and late stages of 
consolidation of CTA memory in the IC; its role in the AMY may 
be related to the acquisition or early consolidation phase of CTA. 
Pharmacological studies showed that inhibition of PKC in the 
IC, AMY or PBN impaired long-term CTA memory formation, 
without affecting short-term CTA memory or attenuation of 
neophobia in the IC [34, 76, 77], which suggests that PKC plays a 
prominent role in formation of aversive-taste memory, but not of 
novel-taste memory. 
PKA, a serine/threonine kinase composed of four regulatory 
and two catalytic subunit isoforms has been shown to be activated 
by cAMP. Although it has not been investigated whether novel 
taste and/or CTA infl uence the expression and activation of PKA, 
behavioral analyses that involved the targeted disruption of RIIβ

Fig. 1. Schematic diagram depicting major signaling pathways under-
lying novel taste learning: (A) versus conditioned taste aversion, and (B) 
in an imaginary neuron within the GC as described in detail in the text. 
(A) ERK/MAPK, a signaling cascade that is critical for taste-memory 
formation, enhances the activity of synaptic-plasticity-related proteins, 
and transcription through ELK-1. The ERK/MAPK and PI3K-AKT-
mTOR pathways regulate general protein synthesis. Following novel-taste 
learning, phosphorylation of mTOR increases and eEF2 phosphorylation 
decreases, providing a negative-feedback signaling loop to enable the 
translation of poorly initiated and, presumably, the learning-related 
mRNAs. (B) Upon binding with the active BDNF, TrkB regulates multiple 
signaling pathways through ERK/MAPK, PI3K and PLCγ. Several 
kinases, including PKA, CaMKIV and ERK/MAPK, were implicated as 
CREB kinases; however, ERK/MAPK-and CREB-mediated transcription 
is illustrated according to taste-learning publications. The activation of 
CREB leads to the expression of target genes, including BDNF and a 
transcription factor C/EBPβ which, in turn, presumably, regulates the 
transcription of late-responding genes. Like novel-taste learning, CTA 
learning enhances translation mediated by the ERK/MAPK and PI3K-
AKT-mTOR pathways. CaMKIIα is associated with the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER), which facilitates the synaptic traffi  cking and transport of 
postsynaptic proteins such as GluN2B and PSD95 via Golgi. Th  e question 
mark indicates that the signaling molecules involved are not known. 
Th  is simplifi ed and schematic representation assumes that the depicted 
molecular processes take place within a single neuron; however, this 
remains to be explored by means of new tools and methods.

subunits of PKA in mice, and pharmacological studies using PKA 
inhibitors have shown that the blockage of PKA activity in the IC 
or the AMY impaired long-term but not short-term CTA memory 
[85-88]. Further pharmacological study that microinjected cAMP 

analog, 8-bromo- adenosine 3’-5’ cAMP, into the IC 30 minutes 
after novel taste consumption and immediately before US, has 
shown that increasing cAMP enhanced CTA memory [89]. Th  ese 
results demonstrate the functional importance of PKA during 
taste learning and memory consolidation.
CaMKII is a serine/threonine kinase that is a highly abundant 
protein in the post-synaptic density (PSD); it has a broad range 
of postsynaptic, membrane-bound and cytoplasmic substrates. 
Activation of CaMKIIα, an isoform of CaMKII, by Ca2+/CaM 
enables intra-molecular auto-phosphorylation of several sites, 
including threonine 286, 305 and 306. Auto-phosphorylation of 
CaMKIIα on threonine 286 enables the subsequent dissociation 
of bound Ca2+/CaM, thereby prolonging CaMKIIα activation, 
which enables partial activity even aft er full dissociation of Ca2+/
CaM. Th  us, CaMKIIα can translate a transient event of elevation 
of intracellular Ca2+ into a prolonged change that is independent 
of that transient change [90, 91]. Th  e roles of CaMKIIα in synaptic 
plasticity and in various learning tasks have been intensively 
investigated [90, 92-96], but very little is known regarding the 
role of CaMKIIα in taste learning. Biochemically, novel-taste 
consumption was shown to increase expression of CaMKIIα 
protein in the IC [50]. It is important to note that in vitro studies 
of the enzyme activity that followed CTAhave shown that it 
attenuated the activity of CaMKIIα in the PBN [97]. However, a 
pharmacological study with a classical CaMKIIα inhibitor, KN-
62 has shown that inhibition of CaMKIIα in the PBN following 
noveltaste and/or CTA elicited CTA [98]. Clearly, many more 
studies are needed to determine whether the activation of 
CaMKIIα is necessary for taste learning and memory and, if so, 
what is the nature of its role(s) in these processes. 
Although the functions of protein phosphorylation by pro-
tein kinases in learning and memory have been studied 
extensively, recent studies also highlighted the importance of 
dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. Protein phosphatases 
(PP) can be grouped into three main classes, according to 
sequence, structure, and catalytic function [99]. Phosphoprotein 
phosphatases constitute the largest family, comprising PP1, PP2A, 
PP2B (also known as PP3), PP4, PP5, PP6, and PP7 and the Mg2+-/
Mn2+-dependent (PPM) family, designated PP2C [99]. Th  e super-
familiesof protein Tyr phosphatases and the aspartate-based 
protein phosphatases, respectively, form the second and third 
classes [100]. Th  e importance and the functional role of PP1/2A in 
several forms of learning and memory have been documented and, 
in addition, recent fi ndings also showed the importance of PP1/2A 
in LTP and LTD [101-108]. Decreased activity of calcineurin (PP3) 
was observed selectively in the AMY 40 min after second CTA 
extinction, whereas PP1 remained unchanged [109]. Conditional

Phosphorylation and Taste Learning

transgenic mice with genetically inhibited calcineurin showed 
improved CTA memory and enhanced resistance to CTA 
extinction [109]. Conversely, conditional transgenic mice with 
increased calcineurin activity showed impaired memory and 
substantially faster CTA extinction. However, the inhibition or 
over-expression of calcineurin that followed the CTA training 
appeared not to affect the CTA memory, which suggests that 
calcineurin plays a major role during the CTA acquisition 
[109]. In support of these transgenic animal findings, a recent 
pharmacological study using okadaic acid - a potent inhibitor of 
PP1 and PP2A phosphatases - showed that inhibition of PP1 and 
PP2A enhanced the CTA memory if injected locally into the AMY 
5 min before, but not aft er CTA acquisition [110]. 

MEMBRANE RECEPTORS

NMDA receptors are composed of GluN1, GluN2 (GluN2A-D), 
and GluN3 (GluN3A-B) subunits. Although the interpretation is 
not yet defi nitive, a large body of evidence supports a tetrameric 
arrangement of NMDA receptors, incorporating two GluN1 and 
two GluN2 subunits of the same or diff erent subtypes [111-114]. 
GluN3 co-assembles with GluN1 and GluN2 to form ternary 
GluN1/ GluN2/ GluN3 tetrameric complexes, and GluN3 has 
also been hypothesized to serve as an alternative for one of the 
GluN2 subunits [114-117]. The available evidence indicates that 
NMDAR modulation is mediated through phosphorylation 
of intracellular loops of its subunits. Activation of PKA, PKC, 
Fyn (of the Src family) kinase, and CaMKIIα has been shown to 
phosphorylate NMDAR subunits. The first indication that the 
NMDAR undergoes phosphorylation following taste learning 
arose from the finding that the net tyrosine phosphorylation 
was enhanced in several proteins in the rat IC following novel-
taste and CTA learning [118]. A subsequent study demonstrated 
that consumption of a novel taste led to increased tyrosine 
phosphorylation of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor 
in the IC, and that it returned to baseline levels once the taste 
became familiar [119]. An important finding was that this 
tyrosine phosphorylation wasindependent of NMDAR activity, 
as indicated by the observation that local application of the 
NMDAR antagonist,2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), 
did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation [119]. However, 
local injection of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors 
(AChR) agonist, carbachol into the IC mimicked this tyrosine 
phosphorylation [120], and release of ACh in the IC following 
novel-taste consumption has also been observed [121, 122]. 
Nevertheless, it remains to be determined whether the prolonged 
endogenous release of ACh is the physiological reason for tyrosine 

phosphorylation of GluN2B. It is noteworthy that the release of 
dopamine was observed following both novel-taste learningand 
CTA, whereas glutamate release was observed following 
only CTA, but not after novel-taste consumption [88]. More 
specifi cally, recent fi ndings have shown a correlation between Fyn 
kinase-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation on residue 
1472 of GluN2B and novel-taste learning [123]. Moreover, this 
increased tyrosine 1472 phosphorylation of GluN2B reinforced 
the association of this NMDAR subunit with PSD95, a highly 
abundant PSD scaff olding protein that has crucial importance for 
learning and memory processes. In addition, local injection of the 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein impaired novel-taste memory 
in the LI-CTA paradigm [123], and a correlative increase in PSD-
95 expression was observed aft er novel-taste learning [124].
As was observed in connection with the enhanced general 
tyrosine phosphorylation of GluN2B that followed novel-taste 
learning and CTA [118, 119], novel-taste learning also has been 
shown to increase the general serine phosphorylation of GluN2B. 
However, this phosphorylation diminished once the taste became 
familiar [125], which was not observed in connection with the 
tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein. Although PKC and 
CaMKIIα were shown to phosphorylate GluN2B at different 
sites on serine residues [126, 127], it is not clear whether PKC/
CaMKIIα mediates this GluN2B serine phosphorylation. 
Th  erefore, it will be intriguing to check which of the serine/thre-
onine protein kinases phosphorylates this observed GluN2B pho-
sphorylation that followsnovel-taste learning. 
The activity of NMDAR can also be mediated by its spatial 
localization. Studies have shown that relocalization of NMDAR 
followed LTP and inhibitory-avoidance learning [128, 129]. 
Novel-taste learning increased GluN2A and GluN2B in the 
detergent-insoluble fraction (130), and another study showed that 
novel-taste learning decreased the expressions of GluN1, GluN2A, 
and the GluN2B subunits of NMDAR in the synaptoneurosomal 
preparation [123]. These differences in NMDAR subunits 
expression from different studies could be attributed to the diff-
erences in the fractionation protocol and the sampling time 
following novel taste learning. The binding of phosphorylated 
CaMKIIα to the overexpressed cytoplasmic (C-) tail of the 
GluN2B in mutant mice that overexpressed C-tail affected 
its biding to the endogenous GluN2B receptor complex. This 
CaMKIIα-GluN2B complex formation also was associated with 
changes in the phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit of α-amino-
3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor 
(AMPAR), and the spatial performance of these mutant mice 
was impaired, according to Morris water maze analysis, which 
suggests that localization of GluN2B is essential for mediating

the downstream signaling cascade that leads to activation of 
learning-related protein changes [95]. Thus, it is very important 
to determine precisely the movement/localization of NMDAR, 
and whether phosphorylation impacts the movement/localization 
process. 
AMPAR comprises hetero-tetrameric complexes composed of 
at least two of four subunits designated glutamate receptor GluA1-
4 [131, 132]. Th  e cytoplasmic tail of the GluA1 subunit undergoes 
distinct phosphorylation on serine 831 and dephosphorylation 
on serine 845 following LTP and long-term depression (LTD), 
respectively [133]. Functionally, phosphorylation on serine 831 
and serine 845 is involved in regulation of AMPAR channel 
properties such as modulation of single-channel conductance and 
total and surface expressions of GluA1 [134]. Following inhibitory 
avoidance training - an associative learning paradigm wherein 
animals learn to associate the dark side of a chamber with a foot-
shock and therefore avoid the dark side in successive trials - the 
increased phosphorylation of serine 831 of GluA1 has been 
observed in the dorsal HIP, in addition to increased expression 
levels of total GluA1 and GluA2 proteins [135]. Moreover, spatial 
learning is also associated with the phosphorylation of GluA1, 
as demonstrated with serine 831/Serine 845 double mutant mice 
in the water maze, an HIP-dependent spatial-learning paradigm 
[136]. Taken together, these fi ndings suggest that phosphorylation 
of AMPAR and its synaptic incorporation are involved in these 
aspects of learned behaviors. The application of the AMPAR 
antagonist, NBQX directly into the IC impaired both acquisition 
and retrieval of taste memory [71], which suggests that the AMPA 
receptor plays a major role in taste recognition and learning. As 
discussed above, PKMζ is essential for CTA memory [80-82] 
and, interestingly, another independent study based on a fear 
conditioning paradigm has shown that PKMζ maintains memories 
by regulating GluA2-dependent AMPA receptor trafficking 
[137]. Further studies are required, to elucidate whether PKMζ 
also maintains CTA memory by regulating the GluA2 subunit. 
Currently, very little is known about the regulation of AMPAR 
in the context of taste learning and memory, therefore, further 
studies are needed to understand the regulation of AMPAR with 
respect to taste learning. 
Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) is a membrane recep-
tor tyrosine kinase activated by BDNF and neurotrophin 4. 
There are two tyrosine phosphorylation residues outside the 
kinase activation domain of TrkB: tyrosine 515 and tyrosine 
785. The binding of BDNF to its high-affinity receptor TrkB 
leads to the dimerization and autophosphorylation of TrkB 
on tyrosine residues in the intracellular domains, which then 
triggers one of three signaling cascades, depending on the site of 

phosphorylation; they are MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3K), and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) (Yoshii and Constantine-
Paton [138]). Ma et al. [33] used immunoprecipitation followed 
by immunoblotting with anti-tyrosine antibody to show that CTA 
conditioning increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkB, 
and that the increase in TrkB phosphorylation was prolonged; 
it was detected 1 and 8 h following conditioning in both the IC 
and the CeA. In causality experiments. Ma et al. [33] have shown 
that inhibition of Trk receptors impaired both short-term and 
long-term CTA memory. BDNF-TrkB signaling is involved 
in transcription, translation and trafficking of proteins during 
various phases of synaptic development, and has been associated 
with several forms of synaptic plasticity and memory [138, 139]. 
As discussed above, CTA conditioning has been shown to increase 
the secretion and synthesis of BDNF in CeA and IC; and Ma et 
al. [33] have observed increased phosphorylation of the BDNF 
receptor, TrkB at the time points before and aft er the increase of 
BDNF synthesis in the CeA and IC, which suggests that CTA 
learning fi rst induced the rapid release of pre-existing BDNF, and 
then increased BDNF synthesis.
Pharmacological analyses that used anti-BDNF antibodies 
and a BDNF antisense oligonucleotide, which, respectively, 
neutralize the endogenously released BDNF and block de novo 
protein synthesis, have found that inhibition of BDNF in the CeA 
signifi cantly impaired CTA [33]. Moreover, exogenous application 
of BDNF into the IC has been shown to reverse the CTA memory 
deficits caused by the anisomycin-mediated inhibition of 
protein synthesis [140]. It is consistent with the previous fi ndings 
that a recent study has also shown that the injection of BDNF 
immediately after anisomycin was applied 5 and 7 h following 
CTA conditioning reversed the anisomycin-mediated CTA 
impairment [47]; micro-infusion of BDNF into the IC was also 
shown to enhance CTA retention [141]. These results are clear 
evidence that BDNF signaling is necessary for the early and late 
consolidation stages of CTA. Importantly, recent findings have 
shown this BDNF-mediated enhanced CTA retention to depend 
on the activation of MAPK-ERKI/II and phatidylinositol-3-kinase 
(PI3K) [142], which suggests that TrkB-BDNF signaling following 
CTA acts via both the MAPK-ERKI/II cascade and the PI3K 
cascade.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In the mammalian CNS cells that perform a given function or 
share common functional properties are oft en clustered together 
[6]. Recent studies based on sophisticated methods of optical 
imaging of intrinsic signals indicated the presence within the

Phosphorylation and Taste Learning

IC of discrete clusters of neurons, which responded selectively 
to different taste modalities [143-145]. Moreover, a functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study has shown that in 
humans different taste modalities elicited differing specific 
patterns, with some overlap [146]. However, neither of these 
imaging techniques currently has the power to provide high-
precision resolutionboth in time and at the cellular spatialscale 
in intact mammalian neural tissue. Nevertheless, it is reasonable 
to assume that clusters of neurons responding to single taste 
modalities might contain more narrowly tuned neurons. 
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1, novel-taste consumption and CTA 
activate many intracellular signaling cascades in the IC and the 
AMY, but it is not known whether these cascades occur within a 
single cell, within narrowly tuned clusters of cells, or in diff erent 
populations of cells. Therefore, techniques with higher cellular 
and spatial resolution of single neurons need to be developed, to 
investigate the molecular signaling cascades that underlie taste 
learning and memory. The recent development of optogenetic 
methods has rendered feasible investigations of specifi c cell types 
in the nervous system, with unprecedented precision and control 
[147, 148]. Th  us, combinations of optogenetics with laser capture 
microdissection and genetic manipulation, followed by use of 
mRNA/protein arrays, liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, 
and bioinformatics tools or with new imaging techniques might 
provide better tools for such as yet unanswered questions.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

For several decades it was believed that consolidation of 
memory, a progressive process of changes and stabilization, was 
a unitary process. However, findings from the recent decade 
demonstrated that memories restabilize over time [149-151]
and thatconsolidation of memory evolves over time, which 
suggests that memories change with time [151]. Interestingly, it 
was shown that, in the absence of negative visceral consequences, 
the strength of novel-taste memory stabilizes over time [152]. 
Despite the differing taste-learning models, available literature 
on taste learning appears to support the concept that the 
post-acquisition phase involves activation of waves of several 
biochemical pathways, and that the reactivation of particular 
pathways is required for consolidation. As discussed in the present 
review, several biochemical changes take place within the first 
hour after taste learning, and these are followed by other waves 
of activity during the subsequent few hours, which suggests a 
temporal segregation of signaling cascades that subservetaste-
memory consolidation. Novel taste and associations of novel 
taste with malaise differentially release the aforementioned 

neurotransmitters in the IC and the AMY and, accordingly, waves 
of kinase activation also have been observed. Furthermore, novel-
taste learning induces two waves of activation of the mTOR and 
S6K, respectively,which suggests that independent rounds of 
translation activation that lead to increased expression of proteins 
are required for taste-memory consolidation. Ample evidence 
indicates that the activation of NMDAR, TrkB, protein kinases, 
transcription factors, and translation regulators,all of which play 
roles in synaptic plasticity are also involved in taste learning and 
in memory formation. The available information regarding the 
modulation of neurotransmitter receptor response, pluripotent 
kinase signaling cascades, gene expression, translation regulation 
and translation by phosphorylation processes has presented 
opportunities for understanding taste learning and memory 
formation.
