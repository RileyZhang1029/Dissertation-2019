Abstract
Many plants respond to winter with epigenetic factors that gradually dampen repression of flowering so
that they can flower in spring. The study of this process was important for the identification of the plant
Polycomb group (PcG) of proteins and their role in the epigenetic control of plant gene expression.
Fittingly, these studies continue to illuminate our understanding of PcG function. We discuss recent
advances, particularly the role of noncoding RNA in the recruitment of PcG to target genes, and the
role of the PcG in regulating the stem cell pool in flowers.

Introduction and context
Many plants that grow in climates with a cold winter
require growth for several months at low temperatures—
a process called vernalization—to promote flowering in
spring, when days lengthen and temperatures increase.
Without this period of cold, plants would grow leaves in
the spring, but would fail to flower. It was noticed that
this phenomenon, familiar to every horticulturist, had
distinctive features; something occurred during those
cold months that left a mark, which, in effect, released a
switch that permitted flowering in spring. Experimental
manipulation of temperature showed that this mark
was very stable and could persist for at least a year after
a vernalization treatment [1]. Although stable during a
plant’s life, the marks were erased between generations,
as the progeny of vernalized plants themselves required
vernalization in order to flower. In recent years, the field
has looked beyond the genome and tested whether
epigenetic changes (i.e., ones that aren’t based on DNA
sequence alteration) were involved. One epigenetic
system involves DNA methylation, and in plants this is
often used for genome defense; for example, to inacti-
vate invading DNA such as transposons, viruses, and
transgenes.

A second epigenetic system is implemented by two
collections of genes known as the Polycomb group (PcG)
and the trithorax group (trxG). Again, methylation is

involved, but in this case it is not the DNA itself that is
modified, it is the histone proteins that package DNA in
the nucleus (Figure 1a). Unlike the changes wrought by
DNA methylation, there is (so far) little clear-cut evidence
that PcG- or trxG-mediated changes are passed between
generations in plants. Rather, they are used to provide
cells with memories of events that occur during the life of
an organism. Typically this is a developmental memory,
hence the PcG and trxG components were first identified
on account of gross developmental abnormalities result-
ing from their mutation. However, they are also used to
record transient environmental events that occur during
the life of the plant. This can be used to predict and adapt
to future environments and may be especially relevant in
plants, which are sessile and so can’t easily escape their
circumstances. Here, we discuss important advances in
our understanding of how PcG genes provide a memory
of winter. Secondly, we describe the emerging role of PcG
and trxG genes in controlling stem cell fate in flowers.
This review is of necessity selective; for more compre-
hensive reviews see [2] or [3].

Recent advances
Vernalization and flowering time
The mechanism of the vernalization response has been
best studied in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana,
where it has been found to depend on the ability of
the PcG system to silence the key gene mediating the

Figure 1. PcG and trxG proteins epigenetically control flowering and flower development

(a) Histone modifications ‘mark’ nucleosomes at specific genes. The nucleosome is an octamer containing two molecules each of histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. For
simplicity, only one of each of the two H2A and H3 tails are shown in the figure. H2AK120 resides on an exposed surface of the nucleosome core. (b,c,d) Likely
components and functions of Arabidopsis PcG and trxG protein complexes equivalent to animal PRC2, PRC1, and TRX complexes are shown. (b) During
vernalization in Arabidopsis, the PHD-PRC2 complex catalyzes H3K27me3 methylation through the SWN histone methyltransferase subunit. VIN3, VEL1, and VRN5
are plant-specific, whereas the other four members are homologs of the animal PRC2 core components. Because three of the four core components of animal PRC2
have been duplicated in Arabidopsis, it is likely that several related complexes exist that differ in components and target gene specificities [2]. For example, in some
complexes, CLF may replace SWN as the histone methyltransferase unit. (c) LHP1, a component of Arabidopsis PRC1, binds H3K27me3. PRC1 may catalyze
H2AK120Ub ubiquitination via its E3 ligase components AtRING1a, AtRING1b, AtBMI1A, and AtBMI1B. EMF1 is likely another (plant-specific) component
whose precise function is unclear. (d) ULT1 and ATX1 may be components of an Arabidopsis trxG complex that catalyses H3K4me3. ATX1, ARABIDOPSIS

vernalization response, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC).
FLC is a potent repressor of flowering, most likely
because its protein product binds and represses two
genes, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and SUPPRESSOR
OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), which
are central players in promoting flowering [4]. Thus in
order for plants to become competent to respond to
environmental
factors promoting flowering (warm
temperatures and long days), FLC must be switched off.
During cold treatments, expression of FLC is progres-
sively reduced and a vernalization-specific complex of
PcG proteins (termed PHD-PRC2, which stands for ‘Plant
Homeo Domain–Polycomb Repressive Complex 2’)
(Figure 1b) is recruited to FLC. Biochemical purification
of this complex [5] indicates that it contains the plant
equivalents of the four core components of an animal
PcG protein complex known as PRC2 (Polycomb
repressive complex 2).

Recently, its function has become clearer. PRC2 acts
as a histone methyltransferase, specifically catalyz-
ing trimethylation of lysine 27 on the histone H3 tail
(H3K27me3). In addition to the core PRC2 components,
PHD-PRC2 contains several plant-specific compon-
ents that are probably required to boost the histone
methyltransferase activity of the complex. Consistent
with this, H3K27me3 levels at FLC increase during
cold treatments and persist afterwards when plants are
moved to warm conditions. H3K27me3 is also necessary

for maintenance of FLC silencing when plants are
removed from the cold.

How then does H3K27me3 cause gene silencing? Although
it is necessary for silencing of FLC, it is not sufficient: in
vernalization1 (vrn1) mutants, FLC activity is restored after
vernalization, despite the persistence of high H3K27
methylation levels [6]. H3K27me3 is not thought to
directly cause chromatin compaction or inhibit transcrip-
tion but is probably recognized by proteins that repress
transcription of FLC. In animals, a second complex of PcG
proteins, called PRC1, is also required for PcG-mediated
silencing. Although the PRC1 complex is less well
conserved than PRC2, an important recent finding is that
several of its members are found in plants and play a
similar role in PcG-mediated repression. One PRC1
member, POLYCOMB, binds H3K27me3, and in Arabi-
dopsis the related LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN 1 (LHP1)
protein has a similar function (Figure 1c) [7]. It is also
likely that PRC2 itself binds H3K27me3, which may help
in the stable propagation of this mark through cell division,
by methylating newly synthesized (unmodified) histones
as they are deposited into chromatin, for example [8,9].
Three other components of PRC1 in animals, RING1A,
RING1B, and BMI1, form a ubiquitin ligase complex
that monoubiquitinates histone H2A at
lysine 119
(H2AK119Ub). The function of this modification is
somewhat enigmatic. Although H2AK119Ub may help
repress transcription directly by blocking RNA polymerase

II transcriptional elongation from the promoters of PcG
target genes [10,11], its importance is challenged by the
observation that PRC1 can cause chromatin compaction
and transcriptional repression independently of its H2A
ubiquitination activity [12]. Be this as it may, two groups
have now identified Arabidopsis homologs of RING1A,
RING1B, and BMI1 (Figure 1c) and the similarity of their
knockout phenotypes with those of mutants inactivating
PRC2 is compelling evidence that they have a similar role
to animal PRC1 [13,14]. In addition, the plant RING
proteins can monoubiquitinate H2AK120 (the residue
in plants that most closely corresponds to the animal
H2AK119, although most of the 13 Arabidopsis H2A genes
don’t encode this residue) in in-vitro assays and are
required for H2A ubiquitination in vivo in Arabidopsis [13].
Although so far only a handful of PcG targets have been
shown to be misregulated in the Arabidopsis atring/atbmi1
mutants, it will obviously be interesting to see if the
Arabidopsis ATRING/ATBMI genes have any role in the
vernalization-induced repression of FLC.

Because the PcG components are mostly expressed fairly
constitutively and seemingly lack specific DNA-binding
activity, a major problem has been to explain how they
are recruited to specific targets such as FLC. Numerous
recent studies in animals have shown that noncoding
RNA play a role in recruitment [3], and two noncoding
RNAs have now been implicated in vernalization-
induced recruitment of PHD-PRC2. One of these, termed
COLDAIR, is a long (about 1 kb) noncoding sense RNA
produced from sequences within the large first intron
of FLC [15] (Figure 2). Expression of COLDAIR is
cold-induced and several observations suggest that it is
functionally important for FLC silencing. Firstly, two
earlier studies using transgene reporters showed that
sequences within the large first intron of FLC are needed
for its stable silencing by cold [16,17]. In particular,
transgenes with deletions that removed part or all of the
COLDAIR gene showed fairly normal downregulation
during cold treatments but regained activity when plants

Figure 2. The FLC locus produces at least two noncoding RNAs

The open reading frame of FLC is shown in turquoise, with exons depicted
as green boxes and introns as black lines. The antisense COOLAIR RNA
is upregulated early after cold treatment. However, only the COLDAIR
transcript is thought to be bound by PHD-PRC2 and so may be more
important in recruiting PHD-PRC2 to the FLC locus. FLC, FLOWERING

were returned to warm conditions. Secondly, several
approaches showed that CURLY LEAF (CLF), the catalytic
subunit of the PHD-PRC2 complex, binds COLDAIR
RNA [15]. This may help recruit PHD-PRC2 to FLC; for
example, if the COLDAIR transcript remains tethered to its
site of transcription at FLC (Figure 2) or alternatively if the
affinity of PHD-PRC2 for chromatin is altered by its
binding COLDAIR. Consistent with this, downregulation
of COLDAIR using RNA interference strongly reduces
the recruitment of CLF to FLC and also impairs the
maintenance of FLC silencing following cold treatments.
A second noncoding RNA, termed COOLAIR, is also
produced from FLC [18]. Like COLDAIR, COOLAIR
expression is also strongly upregulated by cold tempera-
tures. COOLAIR expression is driven by a promoter
located downstream of the FLC coding region (Figure 2)
and produces several antisense transcripts that differ
0
according to their splicing or 3
end. There is good
evidence that COOLAIR also plays a role in regulating FLC
expression. Two genes, FPA and FCA, promote flowering
by downregulating FLC expression. Although FPA and
FCA encode proteins that regulate mRNA processing, until
recently it was problematic that they had no discernable
effect on FLC mRNA processing. Two groups have now
resolved this issue by demonstrating that they regulate the
processing and relative amounts of the different COOLAIR
transcripts [19,20]. However, FPA and FCA are not
required for the vernalization response, and the function
of COOLAIR in vernalization is less clear. Notably, FLC
transgenes that lack sequences downstream of FLC that
include the COOLAIR promoter retain a normal vernali-
zation response [16]. Although this suggests that COOL-
AIR may not be necessary, interpretation is complicated
because these plants retain an endogenous FLC gene that
produces COOLAIR transcripts that could act in trans on
the FLC transgene. It is also noteworthy that COLDAIR
is not sufficient for a vernalization response; thus, the
introduction of FLC intragenic sequences that contain
COLDAIR into a heterologous reporter did not confer
a vernalization response on the reporter [16]. One
possibility, suggested by Heo and Sung [15], is that
induction of COOLAIR by cold may reduce transcription
0
from the normal promoter 5
end of the FLC protein
coding region and promote COLDAIR expression from its
cryptic promoter within the first FLC intron.

Although many plants show a vernalization response
with epigenetic features, the target genes and even the
mechanisms may be different than those in Arabidopsis.
In sugar beet, vernalization results in stable repression of
a floral repressor, which, although it is unrelated to FLC,
acts in a similar fashion to repress an FT homolog [21].
It is not clear yet if this is also PcG mediated. In cereals,
vernalization causes the stable upregulation of VRN1,

which promotes flowering. Here, the epigenetic memory
is of an active state, and is correlated with H3K4me3
methylation at VRN1 [22]. It is likely, although not yet
proven, that this will involve the trxG genes as these are
known to catalyze H3K4me3 methylation and mediate
stable gene activation.

Shaping floral architecture: stemming the stem cell pool
Once flower induction occurs, the indeterminate vegeta-
tive shoot apical meristem at the shoot apex changes
its identity to become an inflorescence meristem, which
makes floral meristems on its flanks. The floral meristem
produces whorls of floral organ primordia, and so gives rise
to the flowers. Like all meristems, the continued produc-
tion of organ primordia requires the activity of a pool of
stem cells in the centre of the meristem. Unlike the other
meristems, the floral meristem is determinate so that organ
production ceases once the carpels are initiated in the
innermost whorl of the flower. Mutations in PcG and trxG
genes are well known to cause changes in floral organ
identity, reflecting their role in controlling floral homeotic
gene activity. However, a second less well emphasized
aspect of their mutant phenotype is an increase in floral
organ number. This reflects an emerging role in controlling
when the flower stem cell pool is terminated.

In Arabidopsis shoots, the stem cells at the top of the
meristem secrete the CLAVATA3 (CLV3) signal peptide,
which restricts the expression of the transcription factor
WUSCHEL (WUS) in the organizing centre beneath
the stem cells. In turn, WUS promotes stem cell fate
and as a result also promotes CLV3 expression non-
cell-autonomously in cells above the organizing centre.
This CLV3/WUS feedback loop mediates homeostasis
of the stem cells via a rapid response to fluctuations
in either CLV3 or WUS expression [23-25].

However, flowers are determinate structures and as a
consequence, a second feedback loop terminates the stem
cell pool of floral meristems. In contrast to the fast and
continuously operating CLV3/WUS system, this feedback
loop, built by WUS and the MADS-box transcription
factor AGAMOUS (AG), occurs just once. Early in flower
development (stage 3), WUS and another transcription
factor, LEAFY, together activate expression of AG in the
centre of the floral meristem. In turn, AG represses WUS
expression but there is a delay of about two days before
WUS expression terminates at stage 6 [26,27]. In addition,
the first step (the activation of AG expression by WUS)
also exhibits a delay: WUS expression occurs during
floral stages 2-5. By contrast, AG is not detectable in floral
meristem until stage 3. The reason for these delays has been
unclear but two recent publications [28,29] reveal the

relevance of epigenetic regulation by the PcG and trxG
(Figure 3).

Carles and Fletcher [28] investigated whether the
activation of AG is dependent on the Arabidopsis SAND
(Sp100, AIRE-1, NucP41/75, DEAF-1) domain protein
ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1) and furthermore, whether ULT1
is involved in trxG function. The authors were inspired
by the gain-of-function phenotypes of 35S::ULT1 trans-
genic plants, which resemble clf mutants in showing
increased AG expression in leaves and inflorescences
[28,30]. Furthermore, ult1 mutants suppress the clf
mutant phenotype in ult1 clf double mutants and show
reduced AG expression [28]. This fits with idea that ULT1
is a trxG factor and works antagonistically to the PcG to
promote AG activity, and may also explain why WUS is
misexpressed in ult1 mutants [30]. Consistent with this
antagonism, 35S::ULT1 seedlings, similar to clf mutants,
have reduced levels of the repressive mark H3K27me3 at
AG, whereas ult1 mutants have increased H3K27me3
levels. The structure of ULT1 makes it unlikely that it is
itself an H3K4me3 methyltransferase, rather it may
interact with such an enzyme as part of a trxG complex
or promote trxG recruitment to targets. Consistent with
this, ULT1 interacts physically with the trxG protein
ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG OF TRITHORAX 1 (ATX1),
which is responsible for local H3K4me3 deposition
(Figure 1d) [28,32]. ATX1 cannot be the only factor for
ULT1-dependent H3K4me3 at the AG locus because atx1
mutants, unlike ult1 mutants, do not show indetermi-
nacy of floral meristems [28] and also retain 85% of
global H3K4me3 levels [33]. Furthermore, although the
ULT1-dependent activation of AG by a slow increase of
H3K4me3 may provide a time buffer that the transcrip-
tion factor WUS on its own may not provide, it remains
unclear whether ULT1 and WUS work in parallel or in
the same pathway.

Intriguingly, the delay in the second step of the AG/WUS
feedback loop—the final suppression of WUS by AG—
may also involve epigenetic control. Sun et al. [29]
identified KNUCKELS (KNU), which encodes a C2H2-
type zinc finger transcription factor, as a direct target of
AG and a key intermediate in the suppression of WUS
expression. Genetic analysis and overexpression experi-
ments imply that KNU is activated by AG and represses
WUS expression [29]. Curiously, although AG binds the
KNU promoter directly, there is a two day lag between the
activation of AG and that of KNU. This time, buffering may
be caused by PcG regulation of KNU. Several observations
indicate that KNU is a PcG target: first, early in floral
meristem development the KNU locus is strongly decorated
with H3K27me3; second, in various PcG mutants KNU is
misexpressed. Using an elegant system for synchronizing

Figure 3. Mechanistic model for transcriptional and epigenetic control of the floral meristem stem cell pool

Serial floral stages with the expression of WUS, AG, and KNU are shown. Underneath, the genomic regions of these genes are shown schematically with
likely binding of transcription factors, expression status, and histone modifications. At the initial stage of flower development (stage ≤1), the KNU locus is
covered by the repressive mark H3K27me3. WUS is activated at stage 2, but the transcriptional activation of AG by WUS is inhibited by H3K27me3.
At stage 3, the AG locus undergoes activation by progressive ULT1/ATX1-dependent H3K4me3 and likely demethylation of H3K27. WUS binds in the large
second intron of AG. AG expression is maintained by autoactivation as well as by H3K4me3. WUS expression terminates at stage 6. The activation of
KNU by AG is initially inhibited by H3K27me3 at the KNU locus between stages 3 to 5. The level of H3K27me3 at the KNU locus is gradually depleted, perhaps
by dilution via successive rounds of cell division, and at stage 6 KNU is expressed, causing WUS repression. The punctual termination of WUS expression
needs additional PRC1 activity, which suggests that the WUS locus accumulates H3K27me3 and H2AK120Ub. AG, AGAMOUS; ATX1, ARABIDOPSIS

floral development, Sun et al. show that between floral
development stage 3, when AG is activated, and stage 6,
when KNU is activated and WUS expression terminated,
H3K27me3 is gradually removed from the KNU locus. But
how can the MADS domain transcription factor AG cause
histone demethylation? One possibility is that AG recruits
H3K27me3 demethylases, which have been identified in
animals but not yet in plants. A simple alternative is that
AG somehow inhibits the binding of PRC1 and PRC2
complexes to the KNU locus and the H3K27me3 mark is
gradually diluted as unmodified histones are incorporated
onto replicated DNA during cell division [34]. Either way,
the H3K27me3 at KNU is not sufficient to prevent KNU
activation by AG but does delay it. Similarly, two other
recent studies that looked at the activation of another PcG
target, in this case by cold, also conclude that H3K27me3 is
important for slowing the kinetics of induction [35,36].
Although the tardy induction of KNU in flowers suggests a

mechanism for the delayed suppression of WUS by AG, it
cannot be the only factor that terminates WUS expression.
Thus, knu mutants have much weaker effects on floral
determinacy than ag mutants, leaving space for other
AG-dependent mechanisms. As WUS is itself a target of
H3K27me3 [37], it is also possible that its repression by
KNU is just the initial step that facilitates a long-term
epigenetic repression by PRC1. Supporting this thesis, WUS
is misexpressed in mutants of components of PRC1, which
bear extra floral organs [13,38].

Future directions
It is likely that whole genome profiling studies will soon
clarify how generally noncoding RNAs are involved in PcG
recruitment; for example, by sequencing the RNAs that are
associated with PRC2 components, as has recently been
done in animals [39]. It will be important to test whether
these RNAs can act in trans, that is, to recruit PRC2 to loci

that are not adjacent to the site of their production. If so,
the mechanism of recruitment is an issue, as it is unlikely
to be simply by sequence homology between the RNA and
the target gene. Whether or not PRC2 binds specific RNA
sequences or secondary structures is also an interesting
question as, at least in in-vitro assays, components such as
CLF bind RNA and single-strand DNA quite generally [40].
It will be important to know whether the AtRING1/
AtBMI1 proteins and their putative mark (H2AK120Ub)
colocalize with PRC2 targets, or rather are restricted to a
subset of targets, and if the latter, whether these targets
show more stable silencing. Lastly, it will be interesting to
learn whether the PcG and trxG play a more general role in
recording transient environmental events than simply the
vernalization response.
