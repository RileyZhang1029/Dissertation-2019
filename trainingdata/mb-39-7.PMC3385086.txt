Shimizuomyces  paradoxus  showed  no  inhibitory  effect  against  plant  pathogen  fungi,  such  as  Fusarium  oxysporum  f.  sp.  lyco-
persici  and  Alternaria  solani.  The  S.  paradoxus  culture  filtrate  showed  higher  seed  germination  and  seedling  growth  rates
in  canola  than  distilled  water  and  potato-dextrose  broth.  A  conidial  suspension  of  1.0 × 104/mL  resulted  in  the  highest  growth
stimulating  effects  on  total  plant  length,  and  fresh  and  dry  weight  of  shoots  and  roots  in  cucumber,  when  compared  to  the
highest  suspension  concentration.  Total  plant  length  and  shoot  weight  increased  with  the  foliar  spray  treatment,  and  root
length  and  root  weight  increased  by  simultaneous  treatments  of  soil  drenching  and  foliar  spray  in  cucumber.  Lower  con-
centrations  of  the  S.  paradoxus  conidial  suspension  increased  the  harvest  of  tomato  fruit.

Shimizuomyces  paradoxus  and  S.  kibiana  were  first  reported
in  Japan  from  mature  fruits  of  Smilax  spp.  [1, 2].  Shimi-
zuomyces species are morphologically similar to Cordyceps
s.  l.  Other  than  Japan,  S.  paradoxus  has  been  reported
only  in  Korea  [3, 4].  Cultural  characteristics  of  S.  paradoxus
have  been  recently  reported  by  Sung  et  al.  [5].  Morpho-
logically and phylogenetically, Shimizuomyces is placed in
the  family  Clavicipitaceae  [1, 6, 7].  Microorganisms  are
known to have different effects on plant growth. Hence, it
was  of  interest  to  observe  the  effect  of  an  S.  paradoxus
conidial  suspension on  non-host  plants.  The  results  showed
enhanced  effect  on  seed  germination  and  seedling  growth  of
canola, plant growth of cucumber, and harvesting of tomato.

Materials  and  Methods

Fungal  isolate. Multi-ascospore  isolates  were  derived
from  S.  paradoxus  specimen  EFCC  C-5280  on  potato
dextrose  agar  (PDA;  potato  200 g,  dextrose  20 g  and  agar
20 g  per  1,000 mL)  plates  and  were  used  in  this  study.
The  specimen  was  collected  from  Mt.  Chundeung  of
Chungcheong-do on July 23, 2000. The specimen and iso-
lates  were  preserved  in  the  entomopathogenic  fungal  cul-
ture collection of Kangwon National University, Korea.

observing  the  effect  of  S.  paradoxus  on  plant  growth,  its
inhibitory  effect  against  two  fungal  pathogens  was  tested.
Isolates  of  Fusarium  oxysporum  f.  sp.  lycopersici  and
Alternaria  solani,  obtained  from  the  Plant  Pathology
Department of Rural Development Administration (RDA),
Suwon,  Korea  were  inoculated  with  an  S.  paradoxus  iso-
late on opposite sides of PDA agar plates and incubated at
25oC.  The  plates  were  observed  after  20  days  of  incuba-
tion with F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and after 25 days
of incubation with A. solani.

To  prepare  S.  paradoxus  liquid  cultures  five  mycelial
PDA agar plate discs (5 mm) were inoculated in PDA broth
(PDA  without  agar)  and  incubated  at  25oC  for  30  days,
then  filtered  through  a  syringe  filter  (pore  size,  0.45 µm;
Advantec  MFS,  Inc.,  Dublin,  CA,  USA).  The  filtrate  was
sterilized  at  121oC  under  1.2 psi  pressure  for  20 min.
Twenty-five  canola  seeds  were  sown  on  filter  paper  at
25oC  for  15  days  in  the  presence  of  5 mL  distilled  water,
PD  broth  culture,  and  sterilized  and  non-sterilized  culture
filtrates separately. Two mL of distilled water was sprayed
on  the  seeds  every  day  to  maintain  humidity.  Germina-
tion  rate,  total  plant  height,  root  length,  leaf  length,  and
leaf width were measured at the end of the incubation.

Effect  of  S.  paradoxus  on  seedling  growth  of  cucum-
ber (Cucumis sativus). Different concentrations of conid-
ial  suspension,  such  as  1.0 × 105,  0.2 × 105,  1.0 × 104,  and
0.7 × 104 per  mL,  were  prepared  to  observe  the  effect  of

growth. The original suspension of 1.0 × 107/mL was used as
the control. Seeds of cucumber var. Eunseong Baekdadagi
were sown in a biosoil bed in 72-cell trays. After 13 days,
the  seedlings  were  transferred  to  20-cm  diameter  pots.
After transferring to pots, 20 mL of conidial suspension of
each concentration was drenched on the soil every 5 days.
Total  plant  height,  root  length,  fresh  weight,  and  dry
weight  of  the  shoots  and  roots  were  measured  after  1
mon.  Dry  weight  was  measured  after  drying  the  material
at 60oC for 48 hr.

The  1.0 × 104/mL  conidial  suspension  was  used  in  dif-
ferent  ways,  such  as  drenching  in  soil,  drenching  in  soil
and spraying on leaves, and only spraying on leaves. Seeds
of  cucumber  of  var.  Eunseong  Baekdadagi  were  sown  in
36-cell  trays.  After  13  days,  each  seedling  was  transferred
to  20-cm  diameter  pot,  and  20 mL  of  conidial  suspension
was  drenched  on  the  soil,  and  10 mL  was  sprayed  on  the
leaves  every  5  days  for  1  mon.  Twenty  mL  of  distilled
water  was  added  to  the  soil  every  5  days  as  a  control.
Total  plant  height,  root  length,  and  fresh  and  dry  weights
were  measured.  Dry  weight  was  measured  as  mentioned
above.

Effect  of  S.  paradoxus  on  plant  growth  of  tomato
(Solanum  lycopersicum). Conidial  suspensions  of  1.0 ×
105,  0.2 × 105,  1.0 × 104,  and  0.7 × 104 per  mL  were  used
to  observe  the  effect  of  S.  paradoxus  on  tomato  fruit  The
1.0 × 107  conidia  per  mL  concentration  was  used  as  the
control.  Seeds  of  tomato  var.  630  were  sown  in  biosoil
bed  in  36-cell  trays  and  only  distilled  water  was  used  in
the  soil.  The  seedlings  were  transferred  to  20-cm  diame-
ter pots  after 60  days of sowing.  After 7  days, 100 mL of
suspension  of  each  concentration  was  added  to  the  soil,
and 50 mL was sprayed on the leaves every wk for 4 wk.
Two-hundred  mL  was  added  to  the  soil,  and  100 mL  was
sprayed  every  wk  for  4  more  wk.  Subsequently,  the  har-
vest was  started and continued for 2 mon. The number of
fruits, fruit weight and diameter, and sugar content (degrees
Brix,  oBx) were measured.

Results  and  Discussion

pathogens  F.  oxysporum  f.  sp.  lycopersici  and  A.  solani
(Fig.  1).  These  two  pathogens  were  used  in  this  study,
because they are very common in the field. However, fur-
ther  tests  are  required  to show  non-inhibitory effects  of  S.
paradoxus  against  other  fungal  and  bacterial  plant  patho-
gens.

The  culture  filtrate  resulted  in  a  good  seed  germination
rate  and  plant  height,  root  length,  leaf  length,  and  leaf
width  of  seedlings  (Table  1,  Figs.  2  and  3).  Furthermore,
the  non-sterilized  culture  filtrate  resulted  in  a  42.1%  and
53.8%  increase  in  plant  height,  compared  to  distilled  water
and  PD  broth,  respectively  (Table  1).  The  culture  filtrate

Effect  of  S.  paradoxus  on  cucumber  seedling  growth.
The  S.  paradoxus  conidial  suspension  resulted  in  better
growth  of  cucumber  than  the  control  (Table  2,  Fig.  4).
Plant  growth  was  most  positively  affected  with  lower
conidial suspension concentrations (Table 2, Fig. 4). How-
ever,  reason  for  this  relationship  was  unclear.  Among  the
conidial suspensions, a concentration of 1.0 × 104/mL showed
the  best  results.  Concentrations  of  0.2 × 105/mL  produced
the  longest  root  length.  All  types  of  treatments  produced
better growth characteristics than the control (Table 3, Fig.

adoxus  enhances  the  growth  of  non-host  plants  due  to  its
anti-microbial properties.

Many  plant  growth-promoting  rhizobacteria  and  fungi
show  resistance  to  pathogens  [8, 9].  Plant  growth-promot-
ing  rhizobacteria  such  as  Pseudomonas  species  enhance
plant  growth  and  crop  yield  [10-14].  Site  competition,
increased phosphate uptake, synthesis of plant growth pro-
moting  substances,  and  antagonism  through  the  produc-
tion  of  antibiotics  and  siderophores  are  some  of  the
mechanisms  for  enhanced  plant  growth  [10, 11, 15-17].
Powder  formulations  of  rhizobacteria  have  also  been  pre-
pared  commercially  promote  rhizobacteria  [12].  Frommel
et  al.  [18]  reported  a  significant  increase  in  root  number,
root  dry  weight,  haulm  dry  weight,  stem  length,  leaf  hair
formation,  secondary  root  branching,  and  total  plant  lig-
nin content by applying nonfluorescent Pseudomonas sp.

Trichoderma  spp.  are  the  mostly  studied  fungal  species
as  biocontrol  agents  [19].  They  produce  growth  regulat-
ing  factors  that  increase  the  rate  of  seed  germination  and
shoot and stem dry weights [20]. T. harzianum has shown
anti-fungal  activity  through  enzymatic  action  [21].  Increased
seedling  emergence,  root  area,  root  length,  and  dry  weight,
as  well  as  shoot  length,  leaf  area  and  increased  P,  Fe,  Zn
and Mn concentrations have been reported with the use of
T.  harzianum  [22].  Lo  and  Lin  [23]  reported  root  growth
in  cucurbitaceous  plants,  including  seedling  height,  root
exploration,  leaf  area,  root  dry  weight,  and  chlorophyll
concentrations  in  Trichoderma  spp.  These  fungi  utilize
various nutrient sources and are resistant to chemicals and
toxins; they can also degrade some toxins [24].

Microbial  interactions  have  been  discussed  in  detail  by
Whipps  [25].  Non-pathogenic  microorganisms  improve
nutrient  acquisition,  hormonal  stimulation,  disease  suppres-
sion,  and  the induction of resistance [26, 27]. Siderophores,
produced  by  most  bacteria  and  fungi,  control  plant  patho-
gens  [28].  Further  studies  such  as  light  and  electron
microscopic studies of leaf, stem, and root as well as  bio-
chemical  (lignin  content  and  chlorophyll  content)  and
morphological  (leaf  area)  studies  are  required  for  a  more
detailed assessment the effect of S. paradoxus on non-host
plant growth.

ever,  the  harvest  was  similar  among  the  lower  concentra-
tions  of  conidial  suspensions  (Table  4).  Fruit  weight  was
highest at a concentration of 0.7 × 104/mL.

The  mechanism  of  the  plant  growth-promoting  effects
of  S. paradoxus  could  not  be  understood from  the  results.
Thus,  it  is  necessary  to  study  the  anti-fungal  effects  of  S.
paradoxus  against  other  plant  pathogens.  S.  paradoxus  is
basically a pathogen of mature Smilax sieboldi fruits. Dur-
ing  both  the  infection  period  of  the  host  and  further
growth,  S.  paradoxus  may  produce  some  anti-microbial
compounds  that  resist  the  effect  of  microorganisms  present
in the environment. Hence, it can be assumed that  S. par-
