In this study, we report that the treatment of strychinine (STR), an inhibitor of glycine receptor, induced premature onset of 
programmed cell death (PCD) of developing chick motoneurons (MNs). Treatment of STR on E4 chick embryo increased the 
apoptosis of MN on E5 when MN PCD does not occur normally. On the other hand, treatment of STR from E3 or E5 for 24 hours 
did not significantly influence the extent of MN PCD, indicating that the STR effect is developmental stage-specific. However, the 
expression of glycine receptor isoform was low on E3-4, and other glycine receptor antagonists did not exhibit PCD-promoting 
activity, suggesting that the STR action on PCD is not related to the glycine receptor activation. Identification of the target molecule 
for STR action may provide novel mechanism how the onset of developmental PCD is regulated.

INTRODUCTION

Programmed cell death (PCD) during the nervous system 
development is believed to be a key mechanism for establishment 
of the numerically optimal neurons-target connections [1, 2]. 
Within a discrete period of the embryonic development (E5~E8), 
for instance, approximately 50% motoneurons (MNs) undergo 
PCD in the chick embryo. PCD of MNs initiates with provisional 
synaptic connections with target muscles, and neurotrophic 
hypothesis explains the principle of developmental PCD: There 
was a competition among MN to acquire sufficient survival factors, 
and the limited amounts of available target-derived neurotrophic 
signals determine the extent of PCD [3-5]. In consistent with this

hypothesis, surgical removal or addition of target muscles in chick 
embryos accordingly resulted in the augmentation or reduction 
of the PCD, respectively [2, 6]. However, neurotrophic hypothesis 
does not explain how PCD initiates. Before their target muscle 
innervation, young MNs do not undergo PCD although they 
never be able to obtain target-derived signals. Considering that 
surgical removal of target does not modify the onset timing of 
PCD, it appears that the onset of PCD may be independent to the 
target-derived signals. Some paracrine/autocrine signals or cell-
autonomous modifications may be involved in the onset of MN 
PCD, but molecular mechanisms and responsible extracellular 
factors are largely unknown.
Neuronal activity during the embryonic development plays 
significant role in the innervations and maturation of synaptic 
circuits, via modulation of the growth cone guidance and 
formation of synapses [7-9]. During the early development, 
inhibitory neurotransmitters such as glycine and GABA act as 
excitatory signals and trigger neuronal depolarization [10-12].

Strychinine Affects  on the PCD of MNs

In addition, several excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmissions 
directly or indirectly affect the PCD of MNs [13-15]. In the course 
of study examining the role of these inhibitory neurotransmission 
on the PCD of MNs, we found that the treatment of strychinine, 
a glycine receptor antagonist, advanced the onset of PCD in chick 
embryos. This new observation may trigger new insight how the 
onset of the MN PCD is modulated during the development. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals and treatments
Fertilized chicken eggs were obtained from Pulmuone Co. 
(Korea). Eggs were incubated in humidified incubator at 38oC. 
Stage of chick embryo was identified according to the Hamilton-
Hamburger’s criteria [3]. Strychnine (300 μg in 100 μl Saline, 
Sigma S8753, St. Louis, MO), Ha966 (300 μg in 100 μl Saline, 
Tocris 0281, Ellisville, Missouri) or L-701324 (300 μg in 100 μl 
Saline, Tocris 0907, Ellisville, Missouri) were applied twice with 
12 hours interval on E3, E4 or E5, and sacrificed 12 hours after last 
treatment. 

Histology
Immunohistochemical analyses were performed as previously 
reported [16]. Briefly, trunk tissues were isolated from embryos 
and immersion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. 
Tissues were then transferred in 30% sucrose, sectioned (7 μm) 
and attached on a gelatin-coated slide glass. After blocking the 
sections with PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton-X100, 
activated caspase-3 antibody (1:500; Cell signaling Technology, 
Beverly, MA) was applied overnight. After several washes with 
PBS, Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody was 
applied for 30 min. Subsequently, sections were washed, counter-
stained with Hechest33342, mounted and observed with a 
confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510, Goettingen, Germany). 

RT-PCR
Total RNAs (1 μg) purified from lumbar spinal cords of chick 
embryo were reverse-transcribed with reverse transcriptase, oligo 
(dT) primer and RNasin (Promega). An aliquot of the synthesized 
cDNA was subjected to PCR amplification with specific primers 
for the target genes. Primer sets for Glycine receptor alpha-1 (5’-
AGA GCC CAT TCC TCC CTC CC-3’ as 5’-primer and 5’-GGC 
AGA TCG TGC TGC TGC TT-3’ as 3’-primer), Glycine receptor 
alpha-2 (5’-CCA GCC AGA GTT GCA CTG GG -3’ as 5’-primer 
and 5’-AGG AAG GCG AGT GGG AAT GC-3’ as 3’-primer), 
Glycine receptor alpha-3 (5’-CAG ACA GCG CAA GAT CCC 
GT-3’ as 5’-primer and 5’-TGA GAT CCA TTG GGC AGG 

ACA-3’ as 3’-primer), Glycine receptor alpha-4 (5’-GGA GCG 
GCA GAT GGG CTA TT-3’ as 5’-primer and 5’-CAG CCC GTA 
GCC TCG GAA GT-3’ as 3’-primer), Glycine receptor beta (5’-
CAC AGC GCT GCA AGA TGC AA-3’ as 5’-primer and 5’-TGC 
CTT GGC AAT CTT GGC TT-3’ as 3’-primer) and GAPDH (5’-
GCT CCC TCA GCT GAT GCC CCC-3’ as 5’-primer and 5’-
AGG GAT GAC TTT CCC CAC AGC C-3’ as 3’-primer) were 
used. To obtain semi-quantitative data, unsaturated range of PCR 
amplification cycles were determined, as 30 (Glycine receptor 
isoforms) or 25 (GAPDH) cycles. Amplified PCR products were 
resolved on 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and 
signal densities were measured by densitometer.

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean±standard error of the mean of 
independent experiments. Comparisons were made using one-
way analysis of variance followed by Sheffe’s multiple comparisons 
test and t-test. Statistical tests were carried out using sigmaplot 
10.0. A value of p less than 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. 

RESULTS 

Premature onset of MN PCD by strychinin treatment on E4 
chick embryo
Strychinin (300 μg in 100 μl PBS/embryo) was applied twice a 
day with 12-hours intervalonto the different stage of chick embryo 
from E3-E6, and the embryos were harvested 24 hours after drug 
treatment (Fig. 1). In control embryos, evidence of apoptotic 
neuronal death such as nuclear condensation (pyknosis) and 
cleavage of caspase-3 was first seen on E5, and increased on E6-
E7. On the other hand, apoptosis of MNs dramatically increased 
on E5 when STR was applied on E4. However, STR treatment on 
E3, E5 or E6 did not affect MN PCD (Fig. 1A~I). Whereas PCD 
was augmented by STR treatment on MN population, however, 
PCD of interneurons (IN) was not significantly modified (Fig. 1J), 
suggesting that STR preferentially affected PCD of MNs. 

Expression levels of glycine receptor subtypes in developing 
chick spinal cord
To evaluate the possible mechanisms of STR function on 
developing spinal cord, we evaluated the expression of glycine 
receptor (GlyR) subunits by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 
2). Functional glycine receptors are formed by a multimer of 
alpha and beta subunits, and 4 alpha subunit isoforms and one 
beta subunit were identified in chicks [17-19]. The expression of 
GlyR-α1 was only marginal in the embryonic chick spinal cord,

whereas other alpha subunits (α2~4) were detected at significant 
levels from E5 and their expressions were progressively increased. 
GlyR-β was first identified at high level on E4, and its expression 
level was also progressively increased. These results suggest that 
functional glycine receptor may be formed from E4-E5, but their 
expression levels were substantially increased by a maturation of 
the spinal cord. 

Effect of other glycine receptor inhibitors on the MN PCD 
Because STR affected the MN PCD only when glycine receptor 
expression was very low, we asked whether STR indeed act via 
glycine receptor. To address this issue, we tested two additional 
glycine receptor antagonists, Ha966 and L701324. These drugs 
bind to different target sites of glycine receptors, and inhibit 
receptor activation competitively or non-competitively [20, 21]. 
However, different from STR, both inhibitors did not influence 
the PCD of MNs on E5 (Fig. 3), indicating that STR effect is not 
mediated by glycine receptor. 

DISCUSSION

In this study, we identified that strychinin promoted premature

onset of the PCD in developing chick MN. Although it is well 
known that the extent of MN PCD is mainly controlled by the 
amounts of available neurotrophic signals from the target muscles, 
little is known about the mechanism how MN PCD initiates. 
Surgical elimination of target muscle did not alter the time course 
of PCD, although it greatly increased the number of dying MNs 
[22, 23]. In this respect, it appeared that target-derived signals 
are not major factors controlling the time course of MN PCD. 
On the contrary, Wang and Scott have demonstrated that the 
transplantation of older limb bud (E5) to young embryo (E4)

Strychinine Affects  on the PCD of MNs

resulted in the premature innervation of young MNs into the older 
target muscles, and the early onset of MN PCD [24]. This result 
indicates that innervation may signal to MNs to initiate PCD, 
suggesting the contribution of target in the PCD onset. Therefore, 
more comprehensive analyses are required. 
In this respect, it is interesting to note that the effect of STR on 
the MN PCD is highly selective on the onset of PCD, but not 
on the extent of PCD. This result suggests that the mechanisms 
controlling the timing of PCD and extent of PCD are dissociable. 
While we found that approximately 30% of embryos die after STR 
treatment (data not shown), we do not believe that MN death is 
caused by general toxicity. We did not include dead embryos in 
the analysis, ruling out the post-mortem degeneration of MNs. 
Furthermore, we found that the effect of STR was selective on 
MN population, and STR only marginally affected the survival of 
interneurons. Different from MNs, interneurons do not undergo 
PCD during the development in the chick [25, 26]. Therefore, this 
selective vulnerability suggests that STR effect was specific to the 
population undergoing PCD. We also found the augmented PCD 
in the dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons (data not shown), 
in consistent with our hypothesis. Finally, we found high level of 
embryonic toxicity (>30%) after treatment of 1 mg concentration 
of picrotoxin which is a selective GABA receptor antagonist. How-
ever, we failed to monitor significant changes in the MN PCD in 
picrotoxin treated embryos (data not shown). Collectively, these 
results demonstrate that the effects of STR on the MN PCD are 
not caused by general toxicity. 
Although STR selectively influences the MN PCD, two indepen-
dent lines of our current observations favor the idea that this is 
not mediated by GlyR. First, we observed that the expressions of 
GlyR subunits were absent or very low in embryos before PCD 
period. It is reported that the expression of glycine receptors are 
increasing during the nervous system maturation, and there was 
a transition of embryonic/neonatal form to adult form of glycine 
receptors [27, 28]. In rat embryonic spinal cord, expression of 
GlyRα2 is predominant, whereas α1 and α3 expressions were more 
abundant in adults, suggesting that GlyRα2 is typical isoforms 
deter mining the characteristics of embryonic form of GlyRs [29]. 
In this study, we found that expression of GlyRα2 isoforms was 
pre dominat in the embryonic chick spinal cords similarly to the 
rat. Substantial level of GlyRα2 mRNA was first identified on E5. 
Considering that STR treatment on E4 selectively influence the 
MN PCD, this expression patterns did not correlated with stage-
spe ci fic action of STR, although we cannot rule out the possi-
bili ty that small amounts of GlyR expression may mediate STR 
action. Another line of evidence more clearly demonstrated the 
re ceptor-independent function of STR. We have employed two 

addi tional glycine receptor antagonists, Ha966 and L701324. 
These two chemicals bind to different sites of GlyR, and they exert 
antagonistic activity via different pharmacological mechanisms 
[30, 31]. However, these two chemicals did not effect on the MN 
PCD, even after sub-lethal concentrations of drug treatments (data 
not shown). 
Currently we do not know the target molecules mediating STR 
action on MN PCD. Considering that the mechanisms how PCD 
initiates are largely unknown, our current observation may help to 
identify novel mechanism underlying the control of PCD onset.
