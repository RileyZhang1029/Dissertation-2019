Abstract The completion of the Human Genome Project lays a foundation for systematically studying the human genome from evolutionary history to precision medicine against diseases.
With the explosive growth of biological data, there is an increasing number of biological databases that have been developed in aid of human-related research.
Here we present a collection of human-related biological databases and provide a mini-review by classifying them into different categories according to their data types.
As human-related databases continue to grow not only in count but also in volume, challenges are ahead in big data storage, processing, exchange and curation.
Introduction As biological data accumulate at larger scales and increase at exponential paces, thanks principally to higher-throughput and lower-cost DNA sequencing technologies, the number of biological databases that have been developed to manage such data deluge is growing at ever-faster rates.
The major objec-tives of biological databases are not only to store, organize and share data in a structured and searchable manner with the aim to facilitate data retrieval and visualization for humans, but also to provide web application programming interfaces (APIs) for computers to exchange and integrate data from various database resources in an automated manner.
Therefore, developing databases to deal with gigantic volumes of biological data is a fundamentally essential task in bioinfor-matics.
To be short, biological databases integrate enormous amounts of omics data, serving as crucially important resources and becoming increasingly indispensable for scien-tists from wet-lab biologists to in silico bioinformaticians.
According to a report of 2014 Molecular Biology Database Collection in the journal Nucleic Acids Research, there are a sum of 1552 databases that are publicly accessible online [1].
It should be noted, however, that such count of publicly accessible databases is conservative.
In fact, there are some databases providing online services without publication in peer-reviewed journal (e.g., The RNA Modification Database at http://mods.rna.albany.edu) or being developed by commer-cial companies (e.g., Ingenuity Pathway Analysis at http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa), making them under-represented in the scientific community.
Considering the con-tinuously proliferating number of biological databases, it becomes increasingly daunting and time-consuming to navi-gate in the huge volume of databases of interest.
The nces and 56 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 13 (2015) 5563 completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 holds sig-nificant benefits for many fields from human evolution to per-sonalized healthcare and precision medicine.
In this report, we present a collection of biological databases relevant to human research and provide a mini-review by classifying them into different categories.
Database classification Biological databases are developed for diverse purposes, encompass various types of data at heterogeneous coverage and are curated at different levels with different methods, so that there are accordingly several different criteria applicable to database classification.
Scope of data coverage According to the scope of data coverage, biological databases can be classified as comprehensive and specialized databases.
Comprehensive databases cover different types of data from numerous species and typical examples are GenBank [2], European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) [3], and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) [4].
These three databases were established as the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration in 1988 to collect and disseminate DNA and RNA sequences.
On the other hand, specialized databases contain specific types of data or data from specific organisms.
For example, WormBase [5] is for nematode biol-ogy and genomics and RiceWiki [6] is for community curation of rice genes.
Level of biocuration According to level of data curation, biological databases can roughly fall into primary and secondary or derivative data-bases.
Primary databases contain raw data as archival reposi-tory such as the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) [7], whereas secondary or derivative databases contain curated information as added value, e.g., NCBI RefSeq [8].
Method of biocuration As a consequence of the explosive growth of data, curation increasingly requires collective intelligence for collaborative data integration and annotation.
Therefore, biological data-bases can also be classified as (1) expert-curated databases, e.g., RefSeq [8] and TAIR, [9] and (2) community-curated databases, which are curated in a collective and collaborative manner by a number of researchers, e.g., LncRNAWiki [10] and GeneWiki [11].
Type of data managed According to the types of data managed in different databases, biological databases can roughly fall into the following cate-gories: (1) DNA, (2) RNA, (3) protein, (4) expression, (5) path-way, (6) disease, (7) nomenclature, (8) literature, and (9) standard and ontology.
Human-related databases Decoding the human genome bears great significance in, from a theoretical view, unveiling human evolutionary history, and from an application view, exploring personalized medicine against diverse diseases.
Considering the heterogeneity in data type, scope and curation, biological databases can be classified into multiple categories under different criteria as presented above, making it easier for people to effectively characterize databases and identify the database(s) of interest.
However, some databases are inaccessible over time or poorly main-tained/updated or even never used [12].
In this study, therefore, we assemble a collection of human-related databases that are widely used and currently accessible via the Internet (Table 1).
As database classification based on data type is informative and straightforward, we assign onemajor category to each data-base, albeit one databasemay correspond tomultiple categories.
In what follows, we focus on databases categorized in DNA, RNA, protein, expression, pathway and disease, respectively.
DNA databases A DNA database centers on managing DNA data from many or some specific species.
The primary function of human DNA databases includes establishment of the reference genome (e.g., NCBI RefSeq [8]), profiling of human genetic variation (e.g., dbSNP [13]), association of genotype with phenotype (e.g., EGA [14]), and identification of human microbiome metagen-omes (e.g., IMG/HMP [15]).
A representative example of DNA database is GenBank [2], a collection of all publicly-available DNA sequences (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gen-bank).
Since its inception in 1982, GenBank grows at an extra-ordinary pace and as of December 2014, contains over 184 billion nucleotide bases in more than 179 million sequences (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/statistics).
RNA databases It is well acknowledged that only a tiny proportion of the human genome is transcribed into mRNAs, whereas the vast majority of the genome is transcribed into dark matter non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that do not encode proteins [16], including microRNAs (miRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), piwiRNAs (piRNAs), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA).
Therefore, an increasing number of human RNA databases have been built for deciphering ncRNAs (e.g., GENCODE [17]), in particular lncRNAs that attract the rising interest (e.g., LncRNAWiki [10]), and characterizing their functions and interactions (e.g., RNAcentral [18]).
A representative example of RNA database is RNAcentral [18].
It provides unified access to the ncRNA sequence data supplied by multiple databases including Rfam [19], lncRNAdb [20], and miRBase [21] (http://rnacentral.org).
Protein databases The purpose of constructing protein databases includes collec-tion of universal proteins (e.g., UniProt [22]), identification of Table 1 Human-related biological databases* Name Link Brief description Refs.

Primary databases (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank) are not shown, as they contain raw data.
#A database may correspond to multiple categories and only one major category is shown here.
Zou D et al/ Human-related Biological Databases 59 protein families and domains (e.g., Pfam [23]), reconstruction of phylogenetic trees (e.g., TreeFam [24]), and profiling of pro-tein structures (e.g., PDB [25]).
A representative example of protein database is PDB, the main primary database for 3D structures of biological macromolecules determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR.
Established in 1971, PDB contains 105,465 biological macromolecular structures as of 30 December 2014, in which 27,393 entries belong to human (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb).
Another example is the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt).
As a collaborative project between EMBL-EBI, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), and Protein Information Resource (PIR), UniProt provides a comprehensive, high-quality, and freely-accessible resource of protein sequence and functional information.
Currently, UniProt includes three member databases: UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef), and UniProt Archive (UniParc).
In addition, UniProtKB consists of two sections: Swiss-Prot (containing a collection of 547,357 manually-annotated and-reviewed proteins as of January 2015) and TrEMBL (containing a collection of 89,451,166 un-reviewed proteins as of January 2015) (http://www.uniprot.org).
Expression databases Expression databases can be used for various purposes, includ-ing archiving expression data (e.g., GEO [26]), detecting dif-ferential and baseline expression (e.g., Expression Atlas [27]), exploring tissue-specific gene expression and regulation (e.g., TiGER [28]), and profiling expression information based on both RNA and protein data (e.g., Human Protein Atlas [29]).
A representative case of expression database is Human Protein Atlas.
As of 30 December 2014, it encompasses expres-sion profiles for a large majority of human protein-coding genes based on both RNA (transcriptome analysis based on 213 tis-sue and cell line samples) and protein data (proteome analysis based on 24,028 antibodies) (http://www.proteinatlas.org).
Pathway databases Pathway databases contain biological pathways for metabolic, signaling, and regulatory pathway analysis.
A representative example is KEGG PATHWAY [30], a curated biological path-way resource on the molecular interaction and reaction net-works.
As the core of KEGG, KEGG PATHWAY integrates many entities that are stored inKEGGsibling databases, includ-ing genes, proteins, RNAs, chemical compounds, and chemical reactions (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html).
Disease databases There are at least 200 forms of cancer in the world, causing 14.6% of all human deaths (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Cancer).
Thus, obtaining complete cancer genomes and identifying molecular mutations and abnormal genes can pro-vide new insights for cancer prevention, detection, and 60 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 13 (2015) 5563 eventually, personalized treatment [31].
Toward this end, there are two well-known cancer projects, viz., The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [32] and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) [33].
TCGA, founded in 2006 by the National Cancer Institute and National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health, aims to collect a wide diversity of omics data (including exome, SNP, mRNA, miRNA, and methylation) for more than 20 dif-ferent types of human cancer (http://cancergenome.nih.gov).
Unlike TCGA, ICGC is a voluntary collaborative organization initiated in 2008 and open to all cancer and genomic researchers in the world.
It aims to obtain a comprehensive description of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic changes in 50 differ-ent tumor types and/or subtypes, which are of clinical and soci-etal importance across the globe (http://icgc.org).
Perspectives Here we summarize a collection of biological databases rele-vant to human research.
This collection, however, by no means pictures the whole range of human-related databases that are currently available.
As primary databases store raw data, data-bases in this collection are most derivative databases, which are built from primary databases and contain curated informa-tion for different data types, and thus would be of great useful-ness for studying the human genome.
In the era of big data, human-related biological databases continue to grow not only in count but also in volume, posing unprecedented challenges in data storage, processing, exchange, and curation.
From this point, it would be necessary to establish a cloud computing platform to store and process such big data and facilitate con-struction/update of a secondary or derivative database [34].
As biological databases are physically distributed and heteroge-neous in data type and format, it is additionally required to build web open APIs to ease data exchange and sharing among different resources [35].
The last but not the least is curation, which becomes an indispensable part in biological databases, principally because curation involves added value by standard-ization and quality control and accordingly enhances data interoperability and consistency [36].
Taken together, biologi-cal databases hold great utilities for human research and can be regarded as an indicator of our potential to translate big data into big discovery.
Considering the current situation in China when compared to other countries, it is our hope that this report may raise the general awareness, albeit better improved nowadays, of the significant role of human-related biological databases not only for academic studies but also for clinical applications.
