Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses exert a suppressive effect on HIV and simian
immunodeﬁciency virus (SIV) replication. Under the CTL pressure, viral CTL escape muta-
tions are frequently selected with viral ﬁtness costs. Viruses with such CTL escape muta-
tions often need additional viral genome mutations for recovery of viral ﬁtness. Persistent
HIV/SIV infection sometimes shows replacement of a CTL escape mutation with an alterna-
tive escape mutation toward higher viral ﬁtness.Thus, multiple viral genome changes under
CTL pressure are observed in the chronic phase of HIV/SIV infection. HIV/SIV transmission
to HLA/MHC-mismatched hosts drives further viral genome changes including additional
CTL escape mutations and reversions under different CTL pressure. Understanding of viral
structure/function and host CTL responses would contribute to prediction of HIV evolution
and control of HIV prevalence.

INTRODUCTION
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses
Virus-speciﬁc CD8
play a central role in the control of HIV and simian immun-
odeﬁciency virus (SIV) replication (Borrow et al., 1994; Koup
et al., 1994; Matano et al., 1998; Jin et al., 1999; Schmitz et al.,
1999; Goulder and Watkins, 2008). CTLs recognize viral antigen-
derived peptides (epitopes) presented by major histocompatibil-
ity class I (MHC-I) molecules on the surface of viral-infected
cells. Under the CTL pressure, viral mutations in and around
epitope-coding regions which result in viral escape from CTL
recognition are frequently selected with the cost of viral ﬁt-
ness (Phillips et al., 1991; Borrow et al., 1997; Goulder et al.,
1997; Price et al., 1997). Thus, analysis of structural and func-
tional constraints in viral proteins could facilitate determination
of effective CTLs that can limit viral escape options, contribut-
ing to immunogen design in development of CTL-inducing AIDS
vaccines.

We previously developed an AIDS vaccine using a Sendai virus
vector expressing Gag (SeV-Gag), which induces Gag-speciﬁc CTL
responses efﬁciently. Our analysis showed vaccine-based con-
trol of a SIVmac239 challenge in a group of Burmese rhesus
macaques possessing the MHC-I haplotype 90-120-Ia (Matano
et al., 2004; Kawada et al., 2008). Gag206–216 (IINEEAADWDL)
epitope-speciﬁc CTL responses exert a suppressive effect on SIV
replication and select for a CTL escape mutation, GagL216S, lead-
ing to a leucine (L)-to-serine (S) substitution at the 216th amino
acid (aa) in Gag capsid (CA) with viral ﬁtness costs (Kobayashi
et al., 2005). Our studies starting with this ﬁnding revealed viral
genome changes in persistent SIV infection, providing insights
into HIV/SIV evolution.

LOSS OF VIRAL FITNESS BY ESCAPE MUTATIONS AND ITS
RECOVERY BY COMPENSATORY MUTATIONS
In contrast to the SIVmac239 challenge experiment, 90-120-
Ia-positive vaccinees failed to control a challenge with another

pathogenic SIV strain, SIVsmE543-3 (Hirsch et al., 1997),
which has the same Gag206–216 amino acid sequence with SIV-
mac239. SIVsmE543-3 has a different amino acid (glutamate [E])
from SIVmac239 (aspartate [D]) at Gag residue 205, and this
GagD205E change resulted in escape from Gag206–216-speciﬁc
CTL recognition, leading to failure in control of SIVsmE543-
3 replication in 90-120-Ia-positive vaccinees (Moriya et al.,
2008).

Theoretically, Gag206–216-speciﬁc CTL responses can select for
either GagD205E or GagL216S mutation. SIVmac239-infected 90-
120-Ia-positive macaques, however, select the latter GagL216S
mutation but not GagD205E in a year postchallenge. This
suggests a possibility that the GagD205E substitution in SIV-
mac239 results in larger reduction of viral ﬁtness than GagL216S.
Indeed, our analysis in vitro revealed much lower replicative
ability of
the virus with this GagD205E substitution, SIV-
mac239Gag205E, compared to the wild-type SIVmac239 (Ina-
gaki et al., 2010). On LuSIV cells, which contain a luciferase
indicator gene under the control of the SIVmac239 long ter-
minal repeat, SIVmac239Gag205E infection showed signiﬁcantly
lower luciferase activity compared to wild-type SIVmac239, indi-
cating suppression of
this mutant virus
replication.

the early phase of

Further passage of SIVmac239Gag205E-infected culture super-
natants in vitro found an additional mutation, GagV340M, result-
ing in a valine (V)-to-methionine (M) substitution at the 340th
aa in Gag. Interestingly, SIVmac239 has V while SIVsmE543-3
has M at the Gag residue 340. SIVmac239Gag205E340M showed
similar replication kinetics with wild-type SIVmac239, indicat-
ing compensation for loss of viral ﬁtness in SIVmac239Gag205E
by addition of the GagV340M substitution. Thus, CTL escape
mutations resulting in loss of viral ﬁtness could be selected
with compensatory mutations. Figure 1 is a schema indicat-
ing the interaction between escape and compensatory muta-
tions.

GAG CA INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTION
The Gag CA is comprised of the N-terminal (NTD) and the C-
terminal domains (CTD) (Momany et al., 1996; Gamble et al.,
1997; Berthet-Colominas et al., 1999). Modeling of CA monomer
structure showed that the Gag 205th residue is located in the helix
4 of CA NTD and the 340th is in the loop between helices 10 and
11 of CTD. A possibility of intramolecular contact between Gag
residues 205 and 340 is not supported by this modeling. However,
CA molecules are known to form hexamer lattice in mature virions
(Ganser et al., 1999; Li et al., 2000; Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2007,
2008; Pornillos et al., 2009). Modeling of CA hexamer structure
revealed that the Gag 205th residue is located in close proximity
to the 340th of the adjacent CA molecule. The molecular model
of CA hexamers incorporating the GagD205E substitution sug-
gested shortening of the distance between Gag205 and Gag340
residues, which appeared compensated by GagV340M substi-
tution. Thus, there may be intermolecular interaction between
Gag residues 205 and 340 in CA hexamers. This is consistent
with our results obtained by viral core stability assay. The core
stability was reduced by the GagD205E substitution but recov-
ered by the GagV340M substitution. Loss of viral ﬁtness by
GagD205E and its recovery by GagV340M implies a structural
constraint for functional interaction between CA NTD and CTD
involved in the formation of CA hexamers. In addition to pre-
vious reports on intramolecular compensation for loss of viral
ﬁtness by CTL escape mutations (Friedrich et al., 2004a; Crawford
et al., 2007), our results present evidence indicating intermolecular
compensation.

REPLACEMENT OF A CTL ESCAPE MUTATION WITH AN
ALTERNATIVE ESCAPE MUTATION TOWARD HIGHER VIRAL
FITNESS
As stated above, SIVmac239-infected 90-120-Ia-positive macaques
usually select
the Gag206–216-speciﬁc CTL escape mutation,
GagL216S, but not GagD205E in a year postchallenge. After that,
however, we found that the GagD205E mutation together with
GagV340M became dominant instead of GagL216S in a 90-120-
Ia-positive macaque (Inagaki et al., 2010). In this macaque, neither
GagD205E nor GagV340M was detected until week 123 after SIV-
mac239 challenge, but both became detectable at week 137 and
were dominant at week 150. In contrast, the GagL216S mutation
dominant until week 123 was undetectable at week 150. Thus, in
this animal, SIVmac239Gag216S, whose replicative ability is lower
than wild-type SIVmac239 but higher than SIVmac239Gag205E,
became dominant under Gag206–216-speciﬁc CTL pressure in the
early phase, while in the later phase, this mutant virus was replaced
with SIVmac239Gag205E340M, whose replicative ability is similar
with the wild-type. This indicates replacement of a CTL escape
mutation with an alternative escape mutation toward higher
viral ﬁtness in the chronic phase, implying persistent Gag206–216-
speciﬁc CTL pressure for more than 2 years after selection of the
CTL escape mutation.

MULTIPLE VIRAL GENOME CHANGES UNDER CTL PRESSURE
In another study (Kawada et al., 2006), we observed accumu-
lation of multiple CTL escape mutations in viral genomes in
SIV-infected macaques. SeV-Gag-vaccinated animals possessing

CTL escape in HIV infection

MHC-I haplotype 90-120-Ia elicited Gag206–216-speciﬁc CTL
responses and controlled viral replication with rapid selec-
tion of
the GagL216S mutation after SIVmac239 challenge.
Among these SIV controllers, two animals (V3 and V5) accu-
mulated additional gag mutations and showed reappearance
of plasma viremia around week 60 postchallenge. Both ani-
mals ﬁrst selected a Gag241–249 epitope-speciﬁc CTL escape
mutation leading to a GagD244E (aspartic acid [D] to glu-
tamic acid [E] at the 244th aa in Gag) substitution, and then,
a Gag373–380 epitope-speciﬁc CTL escape mutation leading to
a GagA373T (alanine [A] to threonine [T] at the 373rd) or
GagP376S (proline [P] to S at the 376th) substitution dur-
ing the period of viral control. At the viremia reappearance,
SIVmac239Gag216S244E247L312V373T with ﬁve gag mutations,
L216S, D244E, I247L (isoleucine [I] to L at the 247th), A312V (A
to V at the 312th), and A373T, became dominant in one of them
(V5), and SIVmac239Gag145A216S244E376S with four gag muta-
tions leading to V145A (V to A at the 145th), L216S, D244E, and
P376S became dominant in the other (V3). These viruses with
multiple gag mutations showed lower replicative ability in vitro
than SIVmac239Gag216S carrying single GagL216S mutation.
Indeed, SIVmac239Gag216S244E247L312V373T carrying ﬁve gag
mutations had lower replicative ability in vitro compared to SIV-
mac239Gag216S244E373T carrying three gag mutations. These
results suggest that selection of CTL escape mutations even with
viral ﬁtness costs could be advantageous for viral replication in vivo
under CTL pressure.

SIV TRANSMISSION INTO MHC-MISMATCHED HOSTS
DRIVES FURTHER VIRAL GENOME CHANGES
Previous studies (Friedrich et al., 2004b; Kobayashi et al., 2005;
Loh et al., 2007) reported reversion of CTL escape mutations
in the absence of CTL pressure by transmission of SIVs carry-
ing single escape mutations between MHC-mismatched hosts.
SIVs carrying CTL escape gag mutations selected in 90-120-Ia-
positive macaques showed lower replicative ability in vitro. We
then examined in vivo replicative ability of those SIVs carrying
CTL escape mutations in 90-120-Ia-negative macaques (Seki et al.,
2008). Coinoculation of macaques with SIVmac239GagL216S and
SIVmac239Gag216S244E373T resulted in rapid selection of the
former; i.e., D244E and A373T mutations were undetectable even
in the acute phase, indicating lower replicative ability in vivo of
the latter carrying three escape mutations than the former. Rever-
sion of L216S was observed in a few months, conﬁrming lower
replicative ability in vivo of SIVmac239Gag216S than wild-type
SIVmac239. Further competition indicated lower replicative abil-
ity in vivo of SIVmac239Gag216S244E247L312V373T carrying
ﬁve gag mutations than SIVmac239Gag216S244E373T carrying
three.

We next examined viral genome changes after challenge of
90-120-Ia-negative macaques with SIVs carrying multiple CTL
escape mutations selected in 90-120-Ia-positive macaques. Chal-
lenge with SIVs carrying ﬁve gag mutations, L216S, D244E, I247L,
A312V, and A373T, resulted in persistent viremia in all four 90-
120-Ia-negative macaques. Two animals exhibited higher viral

FIGURE 2 | Schema of HIV/SIV transmission resulting in accumulation of
multiple viral mutations. Multiple CTL escape mutations resulting in viral
ﬁtness costs do not always revert rapidly even in the absence of CTL
pressure after their transmission into HLA/MHC-mismatched hosts and such

mutants can be transmitted further to other hosts. New escape mutations
and compensatory mutations are also observed with transmissions. Thus,
CTL affects HIV/SIV evolution in individuals with divergent HLA/MHC
polymorphisms.

loads. One of them rapidly developed AIDS at week 18 while the
other developed AIDS 2 years postchallenge. The former showed
reversion of I247L and A312V but still had three CTL escape
mutations, L216S, D244E, and A373T at AIDS onset. The latter
showed reversion of four mutations in a year postchallenge, but
the A373T mutation remained dominant without reversion until
AIDS onset. In the remaining two animals that exhibited lower
viral loads, multiple gag mutations including L216S and D244E
were still dominant without reversion 1 year after challenge.

Thus, in the experiment of challenge with SIVs carrying mul-
tiple CTL escape mutations, the reversion of all the mutations
was not required for AIDS onset, while transmission with SIVs
carrying single CTL escape mutations showed their rapid rever-
sion. This suggests that even HIVs accumulating multiple CTL
escape mutations with viral ﬁtness costs can induce persistent viral
infection leading to AIDS progression after their transmission into
HLA/MHC-mismatched individuals.

The reversion of the L216S mutation was delayed or not
observed after challenge with SIVs carrying multiple gag muta-
tions, whereas challenge with SIVmac239Gag216S resulted in its
reversion in a few months. This may be due to the predominant
selection of the reversion of other mutations, compensatory muta-
tions, or to lower viral replication efﬁciency in the former case.
Our results suggest that CTL escape mutations resulting in viral

ﬁtness costs may not always revert rapidly after their transmission
into MHC-mismatched hosts and can be transmitted further to
other hosts, driving further viral genome changes with accumula-
tion of mutations (Figure 2). These results provide an important
insight into HIV evolution in human individuals with divergent
HLA/MHC polymorphisms.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses exert strong selective pressure
on HIV and play a central role in viral evolution (Kaslow et al.,
1996; Brander and Walker, 2003; Kiepiela et al., 2004; O’Connor
et al., 2004). Correlation of frequencies of viral epitope vari-
ants with prevalence of restricting HLA alleles has been shown,
indicating HIV adaptation to HLA polymorphisms at a pop-
ulation level (Kawashima et al., 2009). Loss of viral ﬁtness by
CTL escape mutations may contribute to HIV control (Martinez-
Picado et al., 2006; Schneidewind et al., 2007), but our results
indicate the potential of even such HIVs with lower viral ﬁtness
to induce AIDS progression. Elucidation of structural constraints
of viral antigens for viral function would lead to determination
of conserved, escape-resistant epitopes whose mutations largely
diminish viral replicative ability (Dahirel et al., 2011), contribut-
ing to immunogen design in development of CTL-inducing AIDS
vaccines.
