Abstract
Autophagy delivers cytoplasmic constituents for lysosomal degradation. This catabolic pathway can
be used to deliver intracellular antigens for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II
presentation.
it also facilitates the processing of
extracellular antigens for both MHC class I and II presentation.

In addition, recent evidence suggests that

Introduction and context
Classically, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class I molecules present intracellular antigens to CD8+
T cells and MHC class II molecules present extracellular
antigens to CD4+ T cells during adaptive immune
responses. However, professional antigen-presenting
cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), can process extra-
cellular antigen for MHC class I presentation by a pathway
called cross-presentation [1]. Vice versa, fragments of
nuclear and cytosolic antigens have been found among
natural MHC class II ligands [2,3], and it has been shown
that some antigens can be presented by MHC class II after
intracellular processing [4,5]. Some of these use autophagy
to gain access to lysosomal degradation in MHC class II
loading compartments [6-10].

Primarily, one particular autophagic pathway, called
macroautophagy, has been implicated in intracellular
antigen processing for MHC class II presentation to CD4+
T cells. During macroautophagy an isolation membrane,
which is thought to have originated from rough endo-
plasmic reticulum, the outer nuclear envelope membrane
or the outer mitochondrial membrane [11-15], engulfs
cytoplasmic constituents such as damaged organelles,
protein aggregates and pathogens. Two ubiquitin-like
systems with the Atg8 and Atg12 proteins at their heart are
involved in extension of the autophagosomal membrane
and substrate recruitment to its interior [16-18]. Upon
completion of
the resulting double membrane-

surrounded autophagosome, these proteins are removed
from the outer autophagosomal membrane, which then
allows the fusion with lysosomes and late endosomes,
such as multivesicular bodies (MVBs). The inner autopha-
gosomal membrane and the autophagosome cargo are
then broken down by lysosomal hydrolases. A subset of
MVBs, known as MHC class II loading compartments, is
used for antigen loading of MHC class II molecules.
Autophagosomes fuse quite efficiently with these vesicles,
resulting in MHC class II presentation of the autophagic
cargo [19]. Thus, macroautophagy can deliver cytoplasmic
antigens for MHC class II presentation to CD4+ T cells.

Major recent advances
In addition to the mechanistically fairly plausible intracel-
lular antigen processing onto MHC class II molecules via
macroautophagy, recent studies have also suggested that
macroautophagy might assist with extracellular antigen
processing for MHC class I and class II presentation. With
respect to cross-presentation, two studies have demon-
strated that viral and tumor antigens are more efficiently
presented in trans to CD8+ T cells when the antigen donor
cell can perform macroautophagy [20,21]. In the first of
these studies, apoptosis-deficient mouse embryonic fibro-
blasts (Bax/Bak-/- MEFs) were more efficiently cross-
presented after influenza A virus infection than wild-type
MEFs. This cross-presentation was inhibited by small
interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of the essen-
tial macroautophagy gene product Atg5 [20]. In a second

study, cross-presentation of the model antigen ovalbumin
and the melanocyte differentiation antigen gp100 was
diminished when macroautophagy was compromised in
the antigen-donating epithelial and melanoma cell lines
via siRNA knockdown of Atg6 and Atg12 [21]. These studies
suggest that macroautophagy assists in the packaging of
antigens for efficient cross-presentation.

In addition, macroautophagy seems to also facilitate the
transport of endocytosed antigen to lysosomes for
degradation as well as facilitating their loading onto
MHC class II molecules. Enhanced delivery of phacocy-
tosed material to lysosomes with the assistance of the
molecular macroautophagy machinery was first described
after Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2) stimulation of murine
macrophages [22]. Furthermore, NOD2 stimulation
enhanced macroautophagy, which enhanced lysosomal
degradation of Salmonella [23]. This pathway also delivered

Salmonella-encoded antigens for MHC class II presentation
and was sensitive to siRNA-mediated silencing of Atg5,
Atg7 and Atg16L1. Interestingly, mutations in NOD2 and
Atg16L1, which predispose for Crohn’s disease, also
compromise both bacterial clearance and MHC class II
presentation of bacterial antigens to CD4+ T cells. Along
the same lines, Atg5-deficient DCs are compromised in
priming CD4+ T cell responses after herpes simplex virus
infection and in efficiently processing extracellular ovalbu-
min for MHC class II presentation [24]. At the same time,
priming of CD8+ T cell responses and cross-presentation
on MHC class I are not affected. Finally, HIV infection of
DCs seems to inhibit macroautophagy in order to increase
virus production and to prevent viral antigen presentation
to CD4+ T cells [25]. Macroautophagy stimulation
enhances, whereas siRNA-mediated silencing of Atg5 and
Atg8 decreases, HIV antigen presentation on MHC class II
but not on MHC class I molecules. Altogether, these data

Figure 1. Macroautophagy regulates cross-presentation and intracellular as well as extracellular antigen presentation on major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules

Autophagosomes, which form isolation membranes around cytoplasmic constituents, fuse with MHC class II loading compartments (MIICs), which are a
subset of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Autophagosomes fuse with MVBs either directly or after fusion with endosomes (forming amphisomes). Autophagic
cargo can also escape from the MVBs via exocytosis and can then be efficiently cross-presented by dendritic cells (DCs).

suggest that macroautophagy facilitates endosome cargo
delivery for lysosomal degradation, which results in
increased extracellular antigen processing for MHC class
II presentation to CD4+ T cells.

Future directions
In light of these recent advances, it has become clear that
macroautophagy regulates antigen presentation by MHC
molecules beyond just intracellular antigen processing
for CD4+ T cell stimulation. However, the mechanisms
of antigen packaging by macroautophagy for cross-
presentation and macroautophagy-mediated accelera-
tion of endosome degradation by lysosomes remain
elusive. In antigen donor cells, macroautophagy could
provide the necessary energy to decorate dying cells with
ligands for phagocytosis, such as, for example, phospha-
tidylserine, which needs to be flipped from the inner to
the outer cell membrane leaflet in order to become an
‘eat-me’ signal [26,27]. Alternatively, autophagosome
cargo could also be more efficiently released from MVBs
via an alternative secretion pathway recently reported for
the yeast Pichia pastoris and the slime mold Dictyostelium
discoideum [28,29]. With respect to macroautophagic
assistance for endosome fusion with lysosomes, it first
needs to be clarified whether this represents an alter-
native use of Atgs, independent of macroautophagy, as
was initially proposed [22], or whether amphisomes, the
fusion vesicles between autophagosomes and endo-
somes, get targeted more rapidly to lysosomes. In a
second step,
the molecular basis for this enhanced
targeting then needs to be elucidated. Irrespective of
the mechanism, macroautophagic support for endosome
fusion with lysosomes could explain why TLR coating
increases antigen processing for MHC class II presenta-
tion [30]. Although much more needs to be done to
characterize the underlying mechanisms,
the recent
studies discussed in this report suggest novel and exciting
pathways in immunology, and cell biology in general, by
which macroautophagy regulates endocytosis and exo-
cytosis,
function in the
degradation of cytoplasmic constituents by lysosomes.
