Abstract
Mechanotransduction plays a key role in both normal physiology and in diseases such as cancer,
atherosclerosis and hypertension. Nowhere is this more evident than in the vascular system, where
fluid shear stress from blood flow plays a critical role in shaping the blood vessels and in determining
their function and dysfunction. Responses to flow are mediated in part by a complex of proteins
comprised of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin and VEGFR2 at endothelial cell-cell junctions; all proteins that
clearly have other, non-mechanical functions. We review recent progress toward understanding the
functions and mechanisms of mechanotransduction by this complex and suggest some principles that
may apply more broadly.

Introduction
Physical forces are key determinants of morphogenesis
during embryonic development and during growth and
remodeling in adults. Diseases such as cancer, athero-
sclerosis and hypertension involve pathological remo-
deling processes in which mechanical
forces play
important roles. A better understanding of these phe-
nomena therefore offers hope for development of new
therapeutic approaches. The basis for these effects
in which cells
appears to be mechanotransduction,
convert
Indeed,
subjecting cells to mechanical force activates numerous
signaling pathways that mediate subsequent responses.
Nowhere is this more evident
than in the vascular
system, where fluid shear stress from blood flow plays a
critical role in shaping the blood vessels and in
determining their function and dysfunction. Responses
to flow are mediated in part by a complex of proteins
comprising PECAM-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhe-
sion molecule 1), VE-cadherin (vascular-endothelial
cadherin) and VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor 2) at endothelial cell-cell junctions. The
importance of this system is illustrated by the fact that
variants in genes encoding PECAM-1 are linked to early

information.

onset atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular
disease, whereas loss of either VE-cadherin or VEGFR2
are embryonically lethal because of vascular endothelial
abnormalities. This article briefly reviews recent progress
toward understanding the functions and mechanisms of
mechanotransduction by this complex. We also suggest
some principles derived from these studies that may
apply more broadly.

Mechanotransduction in the vascular system
Mechanical forces from blood flow exert strong regula-
tory influences on the physiology and pathology of the
cardiovascular system [1]. The major forces of interest are
fluid shear stress, which acts on the endothelium, and
circumferential strain, which acts on the entire vessel
wall. One reason for intense interest in this system is that
atherosclerosis occurs selectively at curved or branched
regions of arteries that experience low time-averaged
shear stress, shear stress reversal, and spatial and
temporal gradients in shear stress [2,3]. By contrast,
risk factors such as high LDL (low-density lipoprotein)
cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, etc are fairly uniform
throughout
the
existence of synergy between mechanical forces and

the circulation. These data suggest

circulating factors in lesion formation. Forces from blood
flow are also essential for proper embryonic develop-
ment of the heart and vasculature [4,5].

levels of

Proposed mechanotransducers for flow include cell-cell
junctions [6], heterotrimeric G-proteins [7], primary
cilia [8], caveolae [9], integrins [10], the glycocalyx [11],
intermediate filaments [12], nucleus [13], ion channels
[14], and the actin cytoskeleton [15]. The total force
from physiological
fluid shear stress from
blood flow is very low compared to traction forces or
force from wall stretch, suggesting that mechanotrans-
duction represents specific sensing of the environment
rather than passive responses by the cell to force. In
the responses to fluid shear stress are
most cases,
endothelial-specific [16,17],
the
responses to shear stress involve endothelial-specific
proteins. A complex of proteins at cell-cell junctions is
the best studied mechanotransducer in this system,
and thus, is discussed here in detail.

suggesting that

Junctional complex is responsible for
transducing shear stress
A mechanosensory complex at cell-cell junctions, consist-
ing of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, and VEGFR2, is required for
the activation of a number of shear-dependent signaling
pathways [6]. These include the pathways that mediate
both cell alignment and activation of many of the pro-
atherosclerotic pathways.

In endothelial cells,

PECAM-1
PECAM-1 is an Ig family transmembrane protein with a
short cytoplasmic domain.
it
localizes mainly to intercellular junctions, where it
binds PECAM-1 on neighboring cells. The PECAM-1
cytoplasmic tail contains two tyrosines (Y663 and Y686)
each in an ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhi-
bitory) motif [18]. These residues can be phosphorylated
by src family kinases to bind the protein tyrosine
phosphatase SHP2. Several mechanical stimuli increase
PECAM tyrosine phosphorylation,
including cyclic
stretching of cells on elastic substrata, cell swelling in
hyposomotic medium, and tension exerted directly on
PECAM-1 by magnetic beads coated with PECAM
antibodies [19,20]. This pathway has been implicated
in activation of Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)
[20], transactivation of VEGFR2 [21] and production of
nitric oxide in response to flow [22].

though viable and fertile
PECAM-1 knockout mice,
[23,24], have vascular defects. They exhibit reduced
nitric oxide-dependent dilation of arterioles in high
shear stress [25], and reduced collateral artery growth in a
model of flow-induced vessel remodeling [26]. In mouse

models of atherosclerosis,
loss of PECAM decreased
lesion size in the lesser curvature of the aortic arch, a well
characterized region of disturbed fluid shear stress
[27,28,29]. This effect was attributed to endothelial
PECAM-1 as transplantation of bone marrow into
irradiated recipients showed that the effect was indepen-
dent of hematopoietic cells [27,28]. In humans, PECAM
single nucleotide polymorphisms are linked to early
onset of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovas-
cular disease [30]. Interestingly, one of these polymorph-
isms is located in the cytoplasmic tail and affects
endothelial PECAM tyrosine phosphorylation [31,32],
and thus, appears to affect intracellular signaling.

In vivo results, however, are complex. The effect of
PECAM on atherosclerotic lesions was not clear in some
regions of the vasculature; moreover, different mouse
models of atherosclerosis gave different
results
[27,28,29]. The data support the idea that endothelial
PECAM-1 is an important pro-atherosclerotic mechan-
osensor for the aortic arch but, at other sites, it can drive
both pro- and anti-atherogenic responses [27,28].
Another complicating factor is that endothelial nitric
oxide synthase is deregulated in the absence of PECAM-1
so that PECAM-/- mice have constitutively high nitric
oxide production, which tends to suppress inflammation
[33]. Additionally, PECAM-1 is expressed in leukocytes
and platelets, where it suppresses cell activation, so that
in PECAM-/- mice these cells are hyperactive [34,35].

VE-cadherin
The second component of the mechanotransduction
complex is vascular endothelial (VE) cadherin. This classic
cadherin is specific to endothelium, where it is a critical
component of endothelial adherens junctions and is
essential for limiting vascular permeability both in vitro
and in vivo [36]. Loss or mutation of VE-cadherin leads
to early embryonic lethality with severe vascular abnorm-
alities [37], indicating a key role in development.

There is evidence for mechanotransduction by some
cadherins; application of force to E-cadherin stimulates
cellular signaling and actin assembly [38,39], and
reinforcement of adherens junctions, which is a form
of mechanotransduction [40,41,42]. However, although
VE-cadherin is essential for endothelial responses to fluid
shear stress as a component of the junctional complex,
there is no evidence for VE-cadherin acting as a direct
mechanotransducer in this context. Homophilic binding
of VE-cadherin is not required for responses to shear
stress, and direct application of force to VE-cadherin does
not stimulate the shear pathway as does application of
force to PECAM-1 [43,6]. Available evidence suggests
that VE-cadherin functions mainly as an adapter in this

system. Thus, VE-cadherin is essential for the physical
association of PECAM-1 and VEGFR2, and for activation
of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase in response to flow or after
application of
Interestingly,
VE-cadherin associates with and modulates VEGFR2
function in response to VEGF as well [37]. However, the
architecture of these complexes is poorly understood.

force to PECAM-1 [6].

VEGFR2
The third member of the complex is VEGFR2 (called KDR
in humans or FLK-1 in mice), the major receptor tyrosine
kinase that mediates the angiogenic effects of VEGF.

VEGF binding triggers dimerization and activation of
VEGFR2,
followed by association with adapter and
signaling proteins [44]. VEGFR2 is an essential protein
since its deletion in mice leads to defective endothelial
cell differentiation and embryonic death at E 8.5-9.5 due
to defective endothelial cell differentiation [45].

Flow stimulates ligand-independent activation of
VEGFR2 and activation of downstream pathways such
as Akt and MAP kinases [46,47,48]. Other flow pathways
that are dependent on VEGFR2 include production
of nitric oxide and activation of the adaptor protein

a) VE-cadherin (vascular-endothelial cadherin) and PECAM-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1) engage in homophilic interactions at intracellular
junctions in cells cultured under static conditions. b) When cells are exposed to fluid flow, cells are exposed to a shear stress force. At the onset of shear stress, a src-
family kinase (evidently fyn) is activated by phosphorylation and is recruited to and phosphorylates PECAM-1 c) Once PECAM-1 is phosphorylated, VE-cadherin
recruits VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) to the complex. VEGFR2 is then phosphorylated by the src kinase and activates downstream
pathways such as Akt and MAP kinases. The specific details of how the complex is assembled (including other binding partners) is currently unknown. Abbreviations:

Shc [43]. Tyrosines Y801 and Y1175 in the VEGFR2
cytoplasmic tail are essential for shear stress responses,
possibly because upon phosphorylation they mediate
association with phosphoinositide-3-kinase [6]. Chemi-
cal
inhibition of VEGFR2 also blocked a transient
increase in actin polymerization and cell stiffness in
response to shear stress [49].

A model for the mechanosensory complex
A simple conceptual model for function of the mechan-
osensory complex is that force applied to PECAM-1 results
in a conformational change that activates or recruits a src
family kinase, recently shown to be fyn [19]. In the presence
of VE-cadherin, VEGFR2 is brought into the complex,
which facilitates its transactivation by fyn. This idea is
consistent with the many studies in which activation of
src family kinases mediate ligand-independent transactiva-
tion of receptor tyrosine kinases downstream of G-protein
coupled receptors or integrins [50]. Activated VEGFR2
then mediates subsequent steps including activation of
phosphoinositide-3-kinase and endothelial nitric oxide
synthase [6] (see figure 1).

Lessons for other systems
One major conclusion from the analysis of mechan-
otransduction in blood vessels is that there are no
dedicated mechanotransducers. Proteins implicated
in mechanotransduction clearly have other, non-
mechanical functions. It seems likely that, during evolu-
tion, proteins involved in a specific linkage or adhesion
function were modified to allow cells to respond to
forces as well. This conclusion is underscored by the
cooperation between VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 in cell-
cell junction stability as well as in flow-induced effects
[51] and of VE-cadherin and VEGFR2 in responses to
VEGF [37].
there are interesting parallels
between the ligand-independent and ligand-dependent
functions of VE-cadherin and VEGFR2.

Indeed,

A second conclusion is that a limited number of proteins
or protein domains function as physiologically impor-
tant mechanotransducers. Physics indicates that every
protein that bears force will undergo changes in
conformation as tension or compression alters the
stability of protein domains under force [52]. Thus, in
principle, mechanotransduction could be highly distrib-
uted, with very large numbers of proteins participating.
However, the biological evidence argues otherwise, since
deletion of specific proteins such as PECAM-1 has drastic
effects on endothelial mechanotransduction [6]. Genetic
studies in model organisms lead to similar conclusions
[37,45]. Protein domains that are designed to change
conformation in ways that promote biologically mean-
ingful signaling are likely to be relatively rare. Identifying

those domains and understanding in detail the effects of
force is the current challenge.
