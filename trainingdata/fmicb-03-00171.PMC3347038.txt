The quality of distinctive artisanal cheeses is closely associated with the territory of
production and its traditions. Pedoclimatic characteristics, genetic autochthonous vari-
ations, and anthropic components create an environment so speciﬁc that it would be
extremely difﬁcult to reproduce elsewhere. Pecorino cheese is included in this sector
of the market and is widely diffused in Italy (∼62.000t of production in 2010). Pecorino
is a common name given to indicate Italian cheeses made exclusively from pure ewes’
milk characterized by a high content of fat matter and it is mainly produced in the middle
and south of Italy by traditional procedures from raw or pasteurized milk. The microbiota
plays a major role in the development of the organoleptic characteristics of the cheese
but it can also be responsible for the accumulation of undesirable substances, such as
biogenic amines (BA). Bacterial amino acid decarboxylase activity and BA content have to
be investigated within the complex microbial community of raw milk cheese for different
cheese technologies. The results emphasize the necessity of controlling the indigenous
bacterial population responsible for high production of BA and the use of competitive
adjunct cultures could be suggested. Several factors can contribute to the qualitative and
quantitative proﬁles of BA’s in Pecorino cheese such as environmental hygienic conditions,
pH, salt concentration, water activity, fat content, pasteurization of milk, decarboxylase
microorganisms, starter cultures, temperature and time of ripening, storage, part of the
cheese (core, edge), and the presence of cofactor (pyridoxal phosphate, availability of
aminases and deaminases). In fact physico-chemical parameters seem to favor biogenic
amine-positive microbiota; both of these environmental factors can easily be modulated,
in order to control growth of undesirable microorganisms. Generally, the total content
of BA’s in Pecorino cheeses can range from about 100–2400 mg/kg, with a prevalence of
toxicologically important BA’s, tyramine and histamine. The presence of BA is becoming
increasingly important to consumers and cheese-maker alike, due to the potential threats
of toxicity to humans and consequent trade implications.

INTRODUCTION
The name Pecorino is commonly given to Italian cheeses made
exclusively from pure ewes’ milk and it has in most cases a pro-
tected designation of origin or PDO status. Generally this type
of cheese is produced in the middle and south of Italy by a
traditional procedure, characterized by a different ripening time
ranging between 8 and 12 months (Di Cagno et al., 2003). The
most popular Pecorino cheeses, such as Pecorino Romano, Fiore
Sardo, Canestrato Pugliese, Pecorino Abruzzese, are usually made
from raw or pasteurized milk which is inoculated with natural
cultures, “scotta fermento,” which is produced by acidifying the
“scotta,” the whey obtained from the manufacture of Ricotta (Di
Cagno et al., 2003; Figure 1). The natural whey cultures are com-
posed mainly of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as
Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis,
and Lactobacillus helveticus. The milk is coagulated at 34–39˚C
adding liquid or powder calf rennet, lamb paste rennet, or pig ren-
net only for Pecorino di Farindola. After cutting the coagulum,
the curds are cooked at 45˚C for 5–10 min. The curds removed
from the vats are placed in traditional and different molds, pressed
manually, and ripened from 4 to 18 months.

However, in spite of these varieties there are many other typolo-
gies of Pecorino (Table 1) produced throughout the Italian terri-
tory according to local or regional costumes, also characterized by
a shorter ripening time (1–2 months), semi-hard consistency, but
low ﬂavor and aroma (Caridi et al., 2003).

For this reason, a differentiation as well as the reduction of
the ripening time can positively inﬂuence the consumption of
these products. In fact the consumer generally prefers sweet ﬂa-
vor which is the result of short ripening (Gobbetti, 2004). More
speciﬁcally, traditional products can take advantage from variants
form speciﬁc attributes.

The principal technological features of more representative

Pecorino cheeses are shown in Table 2.

Each unique combination of ingredients and processing para-
meters leads to a speciﬁc type of cheese with unique properties.
In fact, the use of raw milk and natural thermophilic starters,
cooking of the curd to a high temperature, long ripening, and
generally, an ancient tradition are common features to most of
Pecorino cheeses.

The particular ﬂavor and typical organoleptic properties of
Pecorino cheeses are associated with speciﬁc attributes of milk and

the natural microbiota responsible for fermentation and ripen-
ing processes (Corroler et al., 1998; Beresford et al., 2001). The
artisanal cheeses have different and typical microbial population
dynamics related to the production technology and geographic
area of origin, with a microbiota quite heterogeneous (Poznanski
et al., 2004).

The formation of large amounts of biogenic amines (BA) on
this kind of cheese during the ripening process is allowed by some
conditions, such as the availability of free amino acids produced
as an outcome of proteolysis and viability of microorganisms
possessing amino acid decarboxylating activity. Many genera of
food bacteria are responsible of this characteristic (Suzzi and Gar-
dini, 2003). Lactobacilli are considered producer of histamine,
tyramine, and putrescine, whereas enterococci are considered
tyramine formers and enterobacteria cadaverine and putrescine
producers.

THE MICROBIAL GROUPS OF PECORINO
The microbial composition of raw milk of Pecorino cheeses is
generally within the limits reported by different authors (Clementi
et al., 1994; Ricci et al., 1995; Gobbetti et al., 1997). Total mesophilic
bacteria can range from 106 to 107 cfu/g, micrococci and coagu-
lase negative staphylococci are present at 103 to 104 cfu/g, such

as Enterobacteriaceae and yeasts. Enterococci, representing a typ-
ical microbiota of ewes’ raw milk, are present from 102 to
103 cfu/g. As expected LAB are detected from 102 to 105 cfu/g.
A high level of biodiversity characterizes the natural microbiota
of traditional Pecorino, in particular the indigenous microorgan-
isms present in milk and coming from the environment during
milking and cheesemaking, have a role in the cheese ripening.
Figure 2 shows the concentration range among the prevalent
microbial groups (Di Cagno et al., 2003; Gardini et al., 2006;
Lanciotti et al., 2007; Schirone et al., 2011). Generally high num-
bers of total mesophilic bacteria have been reported in Pecorino
cheeses.

LACTIC ACID BACTERIA
The main groups detected are LAB,
lactococci, and entero-
cocci that are associated with streptococci, mesophilic and ther-
mophilic lactobacilli (represented by Lactobacillus paracasei, Lac-
tobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus rham-
nosus, Lactobacillus curvatus), and other microbial groups (Biz-
zarro et al., 2000; Randazzo et al., 2006; Vernile et al., 2007).
In traditional cheeses S. thermophilus has been isolated up to
9 log cfu/g at 1 month of ripening, in particular from Pecorino
Sardo (Pisano et al., 2006; Comunian et al., 2010). Recently
a strain of S. thermophilus has been found to have a tyro-
sine decarboxylase gene (tdcA), that appear to be a horizontal
gene transfer event from tdcA of L. curvatus (La Gioia et al.,
2011).

Biogenic amines in cheese

FIGURE 2 | Principal microbial groups in some Italian Pecorino cheeses.

Enterococci represent a typical microbiota of ewe’s milk, with
Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis being the most
prevalent ones (Gonzàlez De Llano et al., 1992; Centeno et al.,
1995; Giraffa et al., 1997; Martín-Platero et al., 2009). Generally
their numbers increase during ripening from 106 to 108 cfu/g in
the ﬁnal product. In the 24-h-old cheese, LAB belonging to Lac-
tococcus lactis are the major components and reached 109 cfu/g,
while the enterococci represent 1–10% of the total microbiota
(Bizzarro et al., 2000). During ripening, the level of lactococci
decrease, while the enterococci maintain a constant number, so
that the enterococci may become the most important group. They
constitute part of the normal food microbiota and play an impor-
tant role in manufacture of cheeses typical from mediterranean
countries (Ledda et al., 1994; Arizcun et al., 1997; Franz et al.,
1999, 2003; Mannu et al., 1999; Gomez et al., 2000; Prodromou
et al., 2001; Mannu and Paba, 2002; Foulquié Moreno et al., 2006;
Pisano et al., 2007; Ogier and Serror, 2008). In Pecorino cheese
enterococci constitute a relevant part of the cheese microbiota
(Figure 2). Gelsomino et al. (2002) have demonstrated that ente-
rococci survive and grow in the hidden corners of the milking
machine and the bulk tank, thus contaminating the milk directly.
From the milk, the enterococci are transferred into the cheese.
Regarding BA production, Suzzi et al. (2000) found that great part
of enterococci isolated from Semicotto caprino cheese produce
tyramine but not histamine in synthetic medium. These data are
in agreement with those of Giraffa et al. (1995) and Celano et al.
(1992) who found that tyramine was the only BA produced by
enterococci in milk.

NON-STARTER LACTIC ACID BACTERIA
Non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) dominate the micro-
biota of Pecorino cheeses made from raw milk than in those

made from pasteurized milk (Fox, 1998). In the early phase of
manufacture NSLAB are present at very low numbers, but they
increase throughput ripening and the major part of Pecorino
cheeses has >6.0 log cfu/g at the end of the process (Coda et al.,
2006). In fact indigenous NSLAB have the unique ability to
grow under highly selective conditions prevailing in a cheese
ripening and have been shown to contribute to the formation
of small peptides and amino acids that are precursors for the
ﬂavor components but also for BA formation (Wouters et al.,
2002).

ENTEROBACTERIACEAE
Enterobacteriaceae are not commonly detected in the ﬁnal prod-
uct due to their gradual decrease during cheese ripening (Medina
et al., 1991; Hatzikamari et al., 1999; Dahl et al., 2000). However,
high numbers of Enterobacteriaceae have been reported in different
mediterranean cheeses made from ewes’ and goats’ raw milk after
30 days of ripening (Sánchez-Rey et al., 1993; Freitas et al., 1995,
1996; Freitas and Malcata, 2000; Psoni et al., 2003; Macedo et al.,
2004). In Pecorino Abruzzese Enterobacteriaceae can be detected
after 15 days of ripening at levels of 103 and 105 cfu/g in spring and
summer, respectively, and are still present (102 cfu/g) after 60 days
(Chaves-López et al., 2006). According to previous data obtained
from Enterobacteriaceae inoculated in UHT milk (Chaves-López
et al., 2006), the strains from Pecorino Abruzzese produced high
quantities of putrescine but only small or undetectable quantities
of cadaverine. Moreover, histamine was produced by all the strains.
Many Enterobacteriaceae can produce considerable levels of his-
tamine in fermented foods and particularly Enterobacter cloacae,
Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella oxytoca, as well as Escherichia
coli and Morganella morganii (Suzzi and Gardini, 2003). Although
these microorganisms are usually present in low numbers in the

ﬁnal product, Enterobacteriaceae can release their decarboxylases
in the early steps of cheesemaking (Bover-Cid et al., 2001).

OTHER MICROORGANISMS
In some cases, psychrotrophic microorganisms and Staphylococcus
aureus have been reported (Palmas et al., 1999), indicating a pos-
sible contamination and a poor hygiene during manufacturing.
Generally coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) are represented
by non-pathogenous species, saprophytic, or useful for confer-
ring typical characteristics to the cheese, such as Staphylococcus
xylosus (Palmas et al., 1999). The secondary adventitious micro-
biota belong to the CNS ranging from about 102 to 108 cfu/g and
yeasts ranging from about 102 to 107 cfu/g. In Pecorino Crotonese
Kluyveromyces lactis and Debaryomyces hansenii strains were
found to dominate during the later stages of maturation. Some
strains of Yarrowia lipolytica resulted in the highest aminobiogenic
potential decarboxylating ornithine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and
lysine (Gardini et al., 2006).

PHYSICO-CHEMICAL FACTORS ON BA FORMATION
Other extrinsic factors may play an important role in the accumu-
lation of BA in cheese, e.g., pH, salt concentration, water activity,
and redox potential (Pinho et al., 2001). In Table 3 the physico-
chemical characteristics of Pecorino cheese are reported. The range
values for some parameters are very large, indicating important
differences during the manufacturing and the ripening condi-
tions of Pecorino cheeses. For example NaCl concentration ranges
from 1 to 9%, because some cheeses are salted by immersion in
NaCl brine or by application of salt crystals at different times.
This parameter could inﬂuence water activity, enzyme activity,
and microbial dynamics (Fox and Guinee, 1987; Van der Berg and
Exterkate, 1993). The NaCl concentration in milk slows down the
formation of different amines such as agmatine, spermine, sper-
midine, putrescine, histamine, tyramine, and tryptamine (Santos
et al., 2003).

Then, the characteristics of a Pecorino cheese depend on micro-
biota dynamics. Both starter and secondary microbiota modify the
physico-chemical properties of cheese. Each cheese type should be
studied particularly, given the high variability in physico-chemical
composition. Then, the quality of raw milk, the environmental
conditions, and the traditional manufacture play an important
role in determining the characteristics of an artisanal Pecorino
cheese. Characterizing cheese microbial population may con-
tribute to understand the ecological processes that drive microbial

interaction in cheese and their technological relevance. Knowledge
of the structure and dynamics of the whole microbial community
of cheese would promote better understanding of BA’s formation
with respect to microbial growth and metabolism.

BIOGENIC AMINES IN PECORINO CHEESES
The presence of relevant amounts of BA in cheeses has been
recently documented for a few types of Pecorino cheeses (Mar-
tuscelli et al., 2005; Lanciotti et al., 2007; Del Signore and Di
Giacomo, 2008; Mascaro et al., 2010; Mercogliano et al., 2010;
Bavazzano et al., 2011; Forzale et al., 2011; Schirone et al., 2011).
In these studies the quantitative and qualitative accumulation of
such compounds was extremely variable (Table 4). The diamines,
putrescine and cadaverine, were found in higher concentrations in
Pecorino di Fossa and Pecorino di Farindola. In particular, Mas-
caro et al. (2010) in Pecorino di Fossa found values of 579.60 and
1302.86 mg/kg for putrescine and cadaverine, respectively; while
in samples of Pecorino di Farindola, putrescine ranged from 9.9
to 394 mg/kg and cadaverine from 26.8 to 276.1 mg/kg (Schirone
et al., 2011). Tyramine was always present at high concentra-
tions compared with the other amines of the same cheese. Among
ten batches of Pecorino di Farindola (Schirone et al., 2011) tyra-
mine resulted to be the BA present in the highest concentration
in all cheeses examined, representing in six samples more than
40% of the total amines. A high relationship between tyramine
and total BA content in Pecorino di Farindola cheese was found
(R2 = 0.9869). High values of this BA have been determined also in
Pecorino di Fossa, Pecorino Abruzzese and Pecorino di Migliarino-
San Rossore, particularly in the cheese core (1300 mg/kg). The
relevant incidence of tyramine in cheese manufactured from raw
ewes’ milk has been reported (Roig-Saguès et al., 2002; Martuscelli
et al., 2005; Pintado et al., 2008; Ladero et al., 2010).

Tyramine-producing bacterial strains are expected to be present
in Pecorino especially within the groups of NSLAB, Enterobacteri-
aceae and enterococci, as indicated in the study of Martuscelli et al.
(2005). The high level of tyramine in the Pecorino cheese could
be due to the activity of thermoresistant enterococci, usual cont-
aminants of raw milk. However, the heat resistance at more than
65˚C of some Lactobacillus species, and in particular of L. para-
casei, has been demonstrated (Jordan and Cogan, 1999). There is
evidence that LAB are occasionally associated with tyramine for-
mation, although they can also contribute to the accumulation of
other BA such as putrescine. On the contrary, Enterobacteriaceae
would be associated with cadaverine, putrescine, and histamine
formation, mainly when a deterioration process occurs in either
raw materials or end products (Marino et al., 2003). It is well
known that BA accumulation in cheese can be inﬂuenced, ﬁrstly
by the microbial quality of raw milk, the sanitation procedures
adopted, the use of starter cultures, and the condition and time
of the ripening process (Novella-Rodríguez et al., 2004; Pinho
et al., 2004). The differences detected in BA accumulation could be
attributable to the milk used, probably because of the heterogene-
ity of the cheese typology considered. An analogous heterogeneity
in BA content was observed by Novella-Rodríguez et al. (2003)
in cheeses from bovine milk. The microbial population of raw
milk can inﬂuence BA presence in cheese, even when thermal
treatment are applied such as for a Pecorino cheese (Lanciotti et al.,
2007) or for Pecorino Abruzzese (Martuscelli et al., 2005). It can

Biogenic amines in cheese

be hypothesized that the mild thermal treatment applied selects
a decarboxylating microbial population, which dominates during
cheesemaking and, possibly, during ripening. Similar results have
been reported by Marino et al. (2008) showing the highest BA
contents in cheese produced using pasteurized milk and natural
milk culture; therefore, the thermal treatment of milk seems to be
not enough by itself to reduce the counts of decarboxylase-positive
bacteria in cheese. However, other authors observed a higher BA
accumulation in cheeses obtained from raw milk than in similar
products from pasteurized milk (Schneller et al., 1997).

Cheese is a matrix with a high protein content in which their
demolition to free amino acids (or short peptides) is guaranteed
by proteases or peptidases produced by microorganisms (includ-
ing starter cultures), present in milk (especially if not thermally
treated), and/or in rennet. Given these activities, the availability of
precursors is not a central problem in BA accumulation (Lanciotti
et al., 2007). Fernández-García et al. (2000) studied the inﬂuence
of addition of exogenous proteinases to milk and found that tyra-
mine concentration was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) inﬂuenced by this
addition.

The high content of BA in many Pecorino cheeses could be due,
in part, to proteinases, and peptidases released from rennet used,
particularly artisanal lamb rennets, or pig rennet during cheese-
making of Pecorino di Farindola. In fact the traditional lamb paste
preparation procedure has a signiﬁcant impact on rennet compo-
sition, as has animal age, precedent diet, or slaughtering condition
(Jacob et al., 2011). In artisanal lamb paste production, there is
a substantial microbiota, dominated by LAB (Etayo et al., 2006;
Gil et al., 2007). The use of artisanal rennets often entails prob-
lems concerning curd formation and ﬁnal characteristics of the
cheese. Vincente et al. (2001) reported that the release of free
amino acids during ripening is strongly affected by starter added
to the cheese, and that this effect varies markedly with the rennet
used for cheesemaking. However the level of starter culture does

not appears to affect the population of tyrosine decarboxylase
microorganisms (Fernández-García et al., 2000). As a consequence
of this, the natural whey starter used for Pecorino cheese manu-
facture and the rennet could affect the quality, the quantities, and
variability of BA accumulation.

CONCLUSION
Pecorino cheeses, ewe’s milk dairy products of many Italian
regions, have an important link with their areas of production
which confer on them speciﬁc microbiological, chemical, and sen-
sorial characteristics (Pirisi et al., 2011). The spread use of raw
milk creates a high microbiological biodiversity, such as the use
of different traditional rennets contribute to typical aromas and
ﬂavors. The presence of high contents of BA in Pecorino cheeses
could be related to the enzymatic activity of proteases derived from
microorganisms, or from another origin (rennet) that is important
from a qualitative point of view, i.e., in relation to the type of amino
acids provided to the amino acid decarboxylating microbiota, in
particular tyrosine. The bacteriological composition of milk could
be critical to deﬁne the BA proﬁle in this type of cheese, that is
generally produced in little farms. Even though Pecorino cheese is
very important from economical point of view in certain Italian
areas, studies on BA content and their origin are still scarce. There-
fore, large amounts of BA in cheese could indicate unsuitability,
from a hygienic point of view, of the milk used for cheesemaking.
The need to know in depth and control the indigenous bacter-
ial population responsible for high production of BA and the use
of competitive adjunct cultures could be useful to improve the
characteristics of Pecorino cheese.
