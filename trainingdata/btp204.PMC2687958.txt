Motivation: The ability to predict binding profiles for an arbitrary protein can significantly improve the areas of drug discovery, lead optimization and protein function prediction.
At present, there are no successful algorithms capable of predicting binding profiles for novel proteins.
Existing methods typically rely on manually curated templates or entire active site comparison.
Consequently, they perform best when analyzing proteins sharing significant structural similarity with known proteins (i.e.proteins resulting from divergent evolution).
These methods fall short when used to characterize the binding profile of a novel active site or one for which a template is not available.
In contrast to previous approaches, our method characterizes the binding preferences of sub-cavities within the active site by exploiting a large set of known protein ligand complexes.
The uniqueness of our approach lies not only in the consideration of sub-cavities, but also in the more complete structural representation of these sub-cavities, their parametrization and the method by which they are compared.
By only requiring local structural similarity, we are able to leverage previously unused structural information and perform binding inference for proteins that do not share significant structural similarity with known systems.
Results: Our algorithm demonstrates the ability to accurately cluster similar sub-cavities and to predict binding patterns across a diverse set of proteinligand complexes.
When applied to two high-profile drug targets, our algorithm successfully generates a binding profile that is consistent with known inhibitors.
The results suggest that our algorithm should be useful in structure-based drug discovery and lead optimization.

In most cases, the protein ligand interface is characterized by a number of geometric and/or chemical features (Dror et al., 2006).
This characterization is facilitated by mining high-resolution experimental structures where, ideally, a single protein would be observed interacting with several different bound ligands.
Unfortunately, for most proteins, this type of multiple-binding information is not available (Berman et al., 2000).
To avoid this problem, we chose to focus on sub-cavities within an active site with the assumption that structurally similar To whom correspondence should be addressed.
sub-cavities are likely to exhibit similar binding profiles.
It is important to emphasize the definition of sub-cavity utilized in this work.
We define a sub-cavity to be a small region of the traditionally described active site capable of interacting with a single chemical group (e.g.phenyl, hydroxyl and carboxyl).
That is, an active site is generally composed of 520 sub-cavities.
By considering protein ligand interactions at the sub-cavity level, we can utilize binding information from structurally and functionally distinct proteins.
A pair of proteins whose active sites differ significantly when compared in their entirety may still share similarity at the sub-cavity level.
In this work, we decompose a target active site into a set of sub-cavities, identify structurally similar sub-cavities within other proteins and then use this information to construct a binding profile.
This approach enables inference when no global receptor similarity is available.
There are several existing approaches to analyzing an active sites proteinligand binding preference.
In most cases, these methods aim to predict protein function which differs from our aim of identifying the local binding patterns of sub-cavities.
A result of these different goals is that a direct comparison between our work and the described methods using a common dataset is not feasible.
State-of-the-art methods can be classified into three groups: Template-based methods: these methods (Laskowski et al., 2005; Stark and Russell, 2003; Wallace et al., 1997) accept a template structure as input (e.g.catalytic triad in serine proteases) and query a given structural database for matching patterns.
Their reliance on the provided input template makes them particularly useful for studying or predicting relations to an already known pattern.
The strength of the template-based methods is their speed.
The lightweight template representation (usually, a set of amino acid residues) allows rapid queries against large databases; however, the templates are often overly simplistic and are incapable of capturing the rich physicochemical variations among binding pockets.
Further, templates are often manually generated and are therefore restricted in their complexity.
These limitations make general binding site analysis with template-based methods difficult.
Binding site similarity methods: these methods compare entire binding sites and retrieve sets of proteins which share globally similar binding patterns.
They are commonly used for protein function prediction where similar binding patterns imply similar catalytic functionality.
Several approaches utilize active site geometry (i.e.amino acid backbone, solvent accessible surface or active site volume) (Kuhn et al., 2006; Morris et al., 2005), while other methods exploit both geometry and the chemical function of the amino acid residues flanking the binding site (Najmanovich et al., 2008; Schmitt et al., 2002; Shatsky et al., 2005).
