Alterations in nitric oxide (NO) release in response to psychostimulants in the striatum cause a plastic change contributing to the 
development and expression of addiction. In this study, regulation of NO efflux evoked by acute cocaine in the dorsal striatum 
was investigated using real-time detection of NO in vivo. We found that acute systemic injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg) increased 
NO efflux, which was reduced by the intrastriatal infusion of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390 (7.5 nmol), and 
the dopamine D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole (5 nmol). Increased levels of NO efflux by acute cocaine were also reduced by the 
intrastriatal infusion of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, MK801 (2 nmol) and AP5 (2 nmol). These 
findings suggest that interactions of dopamine D1 receptors and NMDA receptors after acute exposure to cocaine participate in the 
upregulation of NO efflux in the dorsal striatum.

INTRODUCTION

Cocaine, an indirect dopamine receptor agonist, is a powerful 
agent regulating dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmission 
in the central nervous system. In the striatum, acute exposure to 
cocaine regulates dopamine release by blocking the reuptake of 
dopamine in the terminal of the neurons. In addition to dopamine

release, repeated exposure to cocaine regulates glutamate release 
and increases extracellular levels of the transmitter (Rahman et al., 
2005). This regulation is mediated through trans-synaptic circuits 
in the basal ganglia, while it also depends on the responsitivity of 
several intracellular signaling molecules to cocaine (Kalivas et al., 
2003). Increased levels of extracellular dopamine and glutamate 
as a result of repeated cocaine administration interact with 
dopamine and glutamate receptors, respectively, that are integrated 
to the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors 
(Schilström et al., 2006; Go et al., 2010). Accumulative evidence 
demonstrates that activation of NMDA receptors dynamically 
alters Ca2+-dependent neural activity as well as gene expression 
in the medium spiny neurons of the dorsal striatum (Lee et al.,

Acute Cocaine-Stimulated NO Efflux

2010; Choe et al., unpublished observations). These responses may 
cause a plastic change contributing to the addictive properties of 
cocaine.
Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is structurally associated 
with the cytosolic domain of NMDA receptors in the cerebellum 
(Christopherson et al., 1999). Stimulation of NMDA receptors 
activates Ca2+ signaling cascades leading to the activation of 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and 
protein phosphatases, which in turn causes nitric oxide (NO) 
production via alteration of nNOS activity in rat cortical neurons 
and the dorsal striatum (Nakane et al., 1991; Hayashi et al., 1999). 
A previous study demonstrated that stimulation of dopamine D1 
receptors upregulates NO efflux via nNOS activation in the rat 
dorsal striatum (Sammut et al., 2006). The increase in NO efflux 
in the dorsal striatum was also observed after repeated cocaine 
administration via stimulation of dopamine D1 and group I 
metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) (Lee et al., 2010). 
Stimulation of group I mGluRs was found to potentiate NMDA 
receptor-mediated NO production (Lee et al., 2010). Collectively, 
these findings suggest that stimulation of dopamine and/or 
glutamate receptors after cocaine administration is necessary for 
the production of NO efflux in the basal forebrain. In addition 
to repeated cocaine-evoked NO release, it was hypothesized that 
acute injection of cocaine can control extracellular NO release via 
dopamine and NMDA receptor stimulation in the dorsal striatum, 
a key structure participated in extrapyramidal motor and reward 
pathways. In this study we investigated this hypothesis at receptor 
levels using real-time detection of NO efflux using a biosensor in 
the rat dorsal striatum following acute cocaine injection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals
Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250~300 g) were obtained from 
Hyo-Chang Science Co. (Taegu, Korea). Rats were individually 
housed in a controlled environment during all experimental 
treatments. Food and water were provided ad libitum and rats 
were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle. On the day of the 
experiments, injections were given in a home cage in a quiet room 
to minimize stress to the animals. All animal use procedures were 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
and performed in accordance with the provisions of the National 
Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals.

Surgery and intrastriatal drug infusion
Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 

chloral hydrate (6 ml/kg) and placed in a Stoelting stereotaxic 
apparatus. Under aseptic conditions, a 23-gauge stainless steel 
gui de cannula (0.29 mm inner diameter, 10 mm in length) was 
im planted 1 mm anterior to the bregma, 2.5 mm right of the mid-
line, and 4 mm below the surface of the skull. The guide cannula 
was sealed with a stainless steel wire of the same length. The rats were 
allowed at least 5 days to recover from surgery. On the day of 
the ex periments, the inner steel wire was replaced by a 30-gauge 
stainless steel injection cannula (0.15 mm inner diameter, 12.5 mm in 
length) that protruded 2.5 mm beyond the guide cannula. Throu-
ghout the experiments, rats were randomly divided into four 
groups (n=4~5 per group): vehicle + saline, vehicle + cocaine, drug 
+ saline, and drug + cocaine. Drugs were infused unilaterally into 
the central part of the right dorsal striatum 5 min prior to cocaine 
or saline injection in a volume of 1 µl at a rate of 0.2 µl/min in 
freely moving rats. The progress of the injection was monitored by 
observing the movement of a small air bubble along the length of a 
precalibrated PE-10 tubing inserted between the injection cannula 
and a 2.5 µl Hamilton microsyringe. After the completion of the 
in jection, the injector was left in place for an additional 5 min to 
re duce any possible backflow of the solution along the injection 
tract. Cocaine (Belgopia, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium) was dissol-
ved in physiological saline (0.9% NaCl), and each rat received a 
single systemic injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Parallel to each 
drug injection, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/artificial cerebrospinal 
fluid (aCSF) containing (mM) 123 NaCl, 0.86 CaCl2, 3.0 KCl, 0.89 
MgCl2, 0.50 NaH2PO4, and 0.25 NaH2PO4 aerated with 95% O2/ 5% 
CO2, pH 7.2~7.4 or NaCl was injected into either the center of the 
dorsal striatum or the peritoneum 5 min before cocaine or saline 
injection in each experiment, as a control. All drugs except cocaine 
were purchased from Tocris Cookson (Ellisville, MO, USA), and 
the drug solutions were adjusted to pH 7.2~7.4 with 1 N NaOH, 
if necessary. Drug concentrations were determined based on 
previous studies (Ahn et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2009).

Preparation of the NO microbiosensor
The NO microbiosensor was prepared as previously described 
(Alvin et al., 2008) and was cleaned by cycling the applied poten-
tial between +1.4 and -0.2 V for 10 cycles at a scan rate of 500 mV/
s in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, followed by washing with distilled water. 
Subsequently, the Pt microelectrode was coated with a conductive 
polymer (CP) through an electropolymerization reaction with a 
carboxylic acid group TTCA monomer in a 0.1 M TBAP/CH2Cl2 
solution. This was accomplished by cycling the potential between 
0.0 and 1.5 V two times at a scan rate of  50 mV/s. The electrode was 
then washed with CH2Cl2 to remove the excess monomer. The 
CP-coated Pt microelectrode was immersed for 12 h in 0.1 M phos-

phate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.0) containing 20 mM 1-ethyl-3 
[3-(dimethylamino)-propyl] carbodimide (EDC) to acti va te the 
CP carboxylic acid groups. At this point, the EDC treated CP-
mo di fied microelectrode was washed with buffer solution and 
sub sequently incubated for 48 h in 5 mM PBS solution containing 
6 mg/mL cytochrome c (cyt c) at 4oC. Using this procedure, cyt c 
was covalently bound through its amine groups to the carboxylic 
groups on the poly-5,2’:5’,2-terthiophene-3’-carboxylic acid 
(poly-TTCA), thus forming amide bonds. The cyt c/poly-TTCA 
microelectrode was dipped in 1% Nafion solution (diluted with 
ethanol) for 2 min. The Nafion film was then dried for 1 h in a 
cal cium chloride atmosphere. Nafion films were dried in a low-
hu midity atmosphere provided by calcium chloride pellicles in a 
sealed container, which increased stability.

Real-time detection of NO
The real-time detection of NO was performed previously des cribed 
(Alvin et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2010). Briefly, rats were ane s the ti ze d with 
8% chloral hydrate and placed in a Stoelting stereo taxic apparatus. 
The enzyme-coated electrode and the reference electrode of the 
NO microbiosensor were inser ted under ascetic conditions at the 
coordinates of 1 mm anterior of the bregma, 2.5 mm right of the 
mi dline, and 4 mm below the sur face of the skull where the drugs 
were infused. The sensor elec trode was connected to a Potentiostat/
Galvanostat (Model PT-1; Kosentech, Pusan, Korea), which measured 
and recorded the electrochemical signal. The sensor was calibrated 
with a series of NO standard solu tions during pre- and post expe-
ri mental measurements. A 20-min time point was selected based 
on a time course of cocaine injection with peak NO levels at 20 min.

Statistics
Data from NO measurements were recorded as currents which 
were converted to concentrations (μM). Statistical significance 
between groups was determined using one-way ANOVA followed 
by a Tukey’s honestly significant difference test in GraphPad 
Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The level of 
statistical significance was set to p < 0.05.

RESULTS

Performance of the microbiosensor
The NO microbiosensor was calibrated before and after mea sure-
ment of NO levels in the series of experiments (Fig. 1A). Under 
op ti mized conditions, the steady-state currents exhibited a linear 
relationship with NO concentrations in the range of 0~55.0 µM 
(Fig. 1B). The sensitivity of the NO microbiosensor was 0.117 ± 
0.006 µA/µM. The detection limit of NO concentration was 13 ±

3 nM based on five replicates to determine the standard deviation 
of the blank noise (95% confidence level, k = 3, n = 5). The Nafion 
film had a pore size less than 50 nm, which prevents the diffusion 
of peroxide and oxygen. However, NO gas can diffuse somewhat 
easily through Nafion. In addition, the Nafion layer prevents micro-
electrode fouling due to the nonspecific adsorption of proteins and 
other biological materials present in the brain. To remove the in-
terference from oxygen, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide, a thin 
Nafion film was coated onto the cyt c/poly-TTCA surface of the 
electrode. The selectivity of this modified electrode was evaluated 
with cyclic voltamograms in the presence of oxygen and other re-
active oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. 
The sensor exhibited no significant response to these electroactive 
species.

Acute injection of cocaine increased the levels of NO in the 
dorsal striatum
To determine whether acute injection of cocaine alters the NO 
efflux in the dorsal striatum, we measured real-time amperometric 
NO responses for 120 s before and 5 min after acute saline or 
cocaine injection up to 60 min at 10 min time intervals. Acute 
systemic injection of cocaine increased NO levels compared with 
saline injection (Fig. 2A and 2B). Semiquantitation confirmed 
that as a result of cocaine, but not saline, injection, NO levels were 
significantly increased at 10 min, remained up to 20 min, and then 
returned to basal levels (Fig. 2C).

Blockade of dopamine D1 receptors or stimulation of dopa-
mine D2 receptors decreased the acute cocaine-evoked inc-
rease in NO levels
Because acute cocaine increased NO levels, this experiment was 
conducted to determine the involvement of dopamine receptors 
in the regulation of NO efflux in the dorsal striatum. Intrastriatal 
infusion of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390 (7.5 
nmol), significantly decreased an acute cocaine-evoked increase 
in NO levels (Fig. 3A). Intrastriatal infusion of the dopamine D2

DISCUSSION

The present data demonstrate that acute injection of cocaine in c-
reases NO efflux in the dorsal striatum which is likely regulated by 
the interactions of dopamine D1 and NMDA receptors. Although 
evidence concerning the mechanisms underlying NO efflux after 
exposure to psychostimulants is limited, the present finding implies 
that integration of dopamine signals to NMDA receptors in the dorsal 
striatum is required for NO efflux. 
A previous study demonstrated that striatal NO efflux induced 
by electrical or pharmacological stimuli of the substantia nigra is 
regulated by dopamine D1 receptor stimulation (Sammut et al., 
2006), suggesting that NO release in the striatum is primarily me-
di ated by the stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors. Similarly, the 
present data demonstrated that increased levels of NO efflux in the 
dorsal striatum after acute injection of cocaine are decreased by 
blockade of dopamine D1 receptors or stimulation of dopamine 
D2 receptors. It is well known that dopamine D1 receptor is coupled 
to excitatory G-protein (Gs) and stimulation of the receptor in c-
rea ses the levels of adenylyl cyclase (AC), which in turn acti vates 
(phosphorylates) NMDA receptors via protein kinase A (PKA)-
dependent or independent cAMP activity (Cepeda et al., 1998; 
Cepeda and Levine, 1998; Scott et al., 2002). Thus, it can be postulated 
that NMDA receptors can be activated by the stimulation of do pa-
mine D1 receptors after acute cocaine administration, which plays a 
critical role in NO efflux into the dorsal striatum. This speculation 

is supported by the finding that blockade of either dopamine D1 or 
NMDA receptors abolished the increase in NO efflux in the dorsal 
striatum after repeated exposure to cocaine (Lee et al., 2010). Si-
mi lar to this finding, systemic injection of the NMDA receptor 
anta go nist, MK801, decreased striatal NO efflux evoked by electri-
cal stimuli of the frontal cortex (Sammut et al., 2007). Taken together, 
these findings indicate that NMDA receptor stimulation may couple 
dopamine signals to Ca2+ cascades for the regulation of NO efflux 
after acute cocaine administration.
Alterations in Ca2+ levels by the stimulation of NMDA receptors 
consequently cause nNOS activation followed by NO production 
via multiple steps of protein kinase and phosphatase interactions 
(Lee et al., 2010). Previous studies demonstrated that stimulation 
of dopamine D1 receptors activates AC/cAMP (or PKA) cascades 
and phosphorylates nNOS (Centonze et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2002; Park 
and West, 2009). Activation of protein phosphatases by NMDA 
re ceptor-stimulated Ca2+-cascades in the striatum upregulates NO 
efflux via dephosphorylation of phosphorylated nNOS (Nishi et 
al., 2005). Collectively, these findings suggest that dopamine D1 
receptor-dependent Ca2+ influx via NMDA receptor stimulation 
after acute injection of cocaine is required for the regulation of NO 
efflux in the dorsal striatum. It is important to note that repeated 
cocaine synergistically activates NMDA receptors via stimulation 
of dopamine and group I mGluRs, while in acute cocaine only 
do pa mine signals contribute to activate NMDA receptors for the 
production of NO efflux in the dorsal striatum (Choe et al., 2011). 
NO has been suggested as a retrograde neurotransmitter that may 
diffuse from the postsynaptic neurons to the presynaptic neurons 
(Snyder, 1992). Thus, dopamine receptors in GABAergic neurons 
stimulated by acute cocaine may increase the production of NO 
and then increase to diffuse it into the presynaptic dopamine ter mi nals 
of the dorsal striatum (Lee et al., unpublished observations). For 
ins tance, NOS inhibitors blocked cocaine or methamphetamine-
induced dopamine releases in the striatum (Bowyer et al., 1995; 
Inoue et al., 1996), suggesting that inhibition of NO formation re-
duces the development of locomotor activity by the modulation of 
dopamine releases or activation of postsynaptic dopamine re cep-
tors in the striatum. Taken together, these results strongly su g gest 
that activation of dopamine receptors has an important role in NO-
mediated behavioral effects probably via NMDA receptor stimulation 
produced by acute cocaine administration. On the other hand, 
this difference in the regulation of NO efflux after cocaine admini-
stration (acute vs. repeated) may results in the expression of beha-
vioral sensitization.
In summary, regulation of acute cocaine-evoked NO efflux was 
de termined by using real-time detection of NO efflux in the dorsal 
striatum. We found that acute systemic injection of cocaine upre-

and NMDA receptors can contribute to this upregu la tion in the 
dorsal striatum.
