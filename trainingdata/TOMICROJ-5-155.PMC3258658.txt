Abstract:  Clinically obvious  reasons why  children  with neurological  impairment (NMI) may be more  severely affected  
in case of  a viral respiratory tract infection include reduced vital capacity due to muscular weakness or spastic  scoliosis, 
disturbed  clearance  of  respiratory  excretions  (weak  coughing  and  dysphagia),  inability  to  comply  actively  with  physio-
therapeutic  interventions,  recurrent  micro-aspirations  (gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  vomiting  related  to  coughing),  a 
history  of  frequent  exposure  to  antibiotics  and  health  care  institutions,  colonization  with  resistant  pathogens,  impaired 
immunologic defence mechanisms due to severe malnutrition and cachexia, and early clinical deterioration in case of high 
fever with metabolic acidosis and hypercapnia, and maybe associated seizures or febrile convulsions. 

Data from the literature suggests that in all children with NMI, who have to be hospitalized with severe clinical deteriora-
tion due to an airway infection, at least one specimen of nasopharyngeal secretions should be sent as soon as possible to  
a  virologic  laboratory  to  detect  viral  pathogens.  Children  with  severe  NMI  and  those  mechanically  ventilated  for  other  
reasons being hospitalized during the RSV season must be strictly protected against nosocomial RSV infection by means 
of  standard  and  droplet  precautions.  Finally,  children  with  severe  NMI  and  age  below  24  months  of  life  should  receive 
passive immunization with palivizumab following international recommendations.

INTRODUCTION 

  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most fre-
quent  causes  of  lower  respiratory  tract  infection  in  infants 
and  young  children  [1].  Most  children  have  been  infected  
at  least  once  by  24  months  of  age  [2],  and  1  to  3%  require 
hospitalization.  The  morbidity  and  mortality  related  to  
RSV  infection  is  greater  in  prematurely  born  infants  [3],  
particularly  those  with  chronic  lung  disease  [1,  4,  5]  and  
infants  with  hemodynamically  relevant  congenital  heart  
disease [6, 7]. 

  Based  on  these  high  risk  groups,  the  American  Associa-
tion  of  Paediatrics  recommended  criteria  for  prophylaxis 
with  the  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  palivizumab  [8]. 
For  infants  born  between  32  and  35  weeks  of  gestation  the 
policy  statement  referred  to  ‘epidemiologic  data’  and  rec-
ommended  considering  additional  risk  factors:  “child  care 
attendance,  school-aged  siblings,  exposure  to  environmental 
air  pollutants,  congenital  abnormalities  of  the  airways,  or 
severe neuromuscular disease” [8]. 

  Clinically obvious reasons why children with neurological 
impairment (NMI) may be more severely affected in case of 
a  viral  respiratory  tract  infection  are  given  in  Table  1  and 
have  been  extensively  discussed  by  Panitch  [9]  and  Resch 
[10].  Sritippayawan  et  al.  [11]  identified  pneumonia  as  the 
most  important  reason  for  acute  respiratory  failure  and  for

the non-elective initiation of mechanical ventilation (69%) in 
73  children  with  NMI.  Besides  other  confirmed  environ-
mental and demographic risk factors for RSV lower respira-
tory  tract  disease  [5]  NMI  was  cited  as  a  risk  factor  in  par-
ticular  as  comorbidity  in  preterm  infants  born  between  32 
and 35 weeks of gestation [12]. 

DATA  ON  RSV-INFECTION  IN  CHILDREN  WITH 
PRE-EXISTING NEUROMUSCULAR IMPAIRMENT 

 
In  a  subgroup  analysis  of  the  Canadian  PICNIC  RSV-
database, Arnold and co-workers [13] compared the outcome 
of  RSV  infection  in  children  with  CLD  with  those  having 
other  chronic  conditions  such  as  NMI,  cystic  fibrosis  and 
pulmonary  malformation.  In  that  study  the  proportions  of 
patients admitted  to the intensive care unit  and of those me-
chanically ventilated were not significantly different between 
premature  infants  with  CLD  and  children  with  NMI,  sup-
porting  the  hypothesis  that  children  with  NMI  face  an  in-
creased  risk  of  complications.  These  results  referred  only  to 
6 retrospectively identified patients (NMI subgroup). Five of 
these 6 children with NMI were older than 12 months. 

  Resch  and  co-workers  [14]  from  Graz/Austria  identified 
45  prematurely  born  infants  with  clinically  significant  
neurologic  handicaps  in  their  retrospective  single  centre  
cohort  study,  which  included  453  infants  with  a  gestational 
age  at  birth  of  29-36  weeks  of  gestation.  The  NMI  rate  was 
26%  in  infants  born  at  29-32  weeks  of  gestation  and  5%  in 
those  born  at  33-36  weeks.  In  a  multivariate  analysis,  NMI 
was  confirmed  as  a  significant  independent  risk  factor  for 
rehospitalization  (21%  vs.  9%;  OR  2.93;  CI95  1.44-5.97;

p<0.001). The same group reported in 2006 the results of an 
Austrian  multicenter  observational  study,  in  which  801  pre-
mature infants with a gestational age at birth of 29-32 weeks 
were included [15]. These children represented 60-70% of all 
infants  born  in  Austria  in  this  age  group  during  the  surveil-
lance period (2001-2003). Of all  these preterms, 84 (10.5%) 
had neurologic disease and 30 (3.8%) were classified as suf-
fering from ‘severe neurological disease’. Although presence 
of NMI doubled the risk of rehospitalization in the univariate 
analysis,  the  confidence  interval  (CI95)  of  the  odds  ratio  in 
multivariate  analysis  failed  to  prove  a  significant  difference 
(OR 2.16; CI95 0.77-5.25) [15]. 

  The  first  prospective  multicenter  study  confirming  the 
hypothesis  that  hospitalized  children  with  clinically  relevant 
NMI  run  an  increased  risk  for  severe  RSV-disease,  was  a 
study  published  from  our  group,  in  which  six  consecutive 
RSV seasons were covered [16]. The surveillance took place 
in  14  paediatric  hospitals  in  Germany  from  1999-2005.  In 
total,  1568  RSV  infections  were  prospectively  documented 
in  1541  paediatric  inpatients.  Of  these,  73  (4.7%)  patients 
displayed  a  clinically relevant NMI; 41 (56%) NMI patients 
had  at  least  one  additional  risk  factor  for  a  severe  course  of 
the  infection  (multiple  risk  factors  in  some  patients;  prema-
turity in 30, congenital heart disease in 19, chronic lung dis-
ease 6, and immunodeficiency in 8). Median age at diagnosis 
was higher in NMI patients (14 mo vs. 5 mo), NMI patients 
had a greater risk of seizures (15.1% vs. 1.6%), and a higher 
proportion  in  the  NMI  group  had  to  be  mechanically  venti-
lated  (9.6%  vs.  1.9%).  Eventually,  the  attributable  mortality 
was  significantly  higher  in  the  NMI  group  (5.5%  vs.  0.2%; 
p<0.001  for  all).  Multivariate  logistic  regression  confirmed 
that  NMI  was  independently  associated  with  PICU  admis-
sion  (odds  ratio  4.94;  95%  confidence  interval  2.69  to  8.94; 
p<0.001]  and  mechanical  ventilation  (OR  3.85;  1.28  to 
10.22;  p=0.017).  Our  study  did  not  document  higher  rates  
of  pneumonia  in  children  with  NMI.  This  suggests  that  
radiologically confirmed pneumonia is not a prerequisite for 
respiratory  failure  in  these  patients.  Even  infections  of  the 
upper respiratory tract  lead to an increase  in nasopharyngeal 
and  tracheal  secretions,  which  cannot  be  cleared  by  the  

patients because of muscle weakness and an impaired cough 
mechanism  [17].  Any  acute  viral  infection,  in  particular  if 
associated with  airway obstruction [18] could aggravate res-
piratory muscle fatigue and predispose children with NMI to 
severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia. As shown previously by 
others [19], even children, who are on prolonged mechanical 
ventilation for other reasons  are at risk for nosocomial  RSV 
infection.  

  Thorburn  and  co-workers  [19-21]  from  the  Department 
of  Paediatric  Intensive  Care,  Royal  Liverpool  Children's 
Hospital-Alder Hey, have investigated the role of RSV infec-
tion in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a sequence of 
three  interesting  studies.  In  the  most  recently  published  co-
hort study comprising all children with severe RSV infection 
from  eight  consecutive  RSV  seasons  (1999-2007),  the 
authors  included  406  RSV-positive  patients  admitted  to 
PICU.  Of  these,  98.5%  required  mechanical  ventilation  and 
35  children  (8,6%)  died  [median  age  5.1  months;  interquar-
tile range (IQR) 2.4-13.6)]. The median length of PICU stay 
in the subgroup with fatal outcome was 16 days (IQR 8-31). 
The  median  age  in  371  survivors  was  2.5  months  (IQR  1.2-
9)  with  a  corresponding  median  length  of  PICU  stay  of  5 
days (IQR 4-9). During  the study period 2009  RSV-positive 
patients  were  admitted  to  the  children's  hospital,  giving  an 
overall hospital RSV mortality rate of 1.7%.  

  Of  the  deaths,  18  were  directly  RSV  related  (RSV  bron-
chiolitis-related  mortality  PICU  4.4%  and  hospital  0.9%)  as 
the  patients  were  still  RSV  positive  when  they  died  and  17 
children  died  from  non-pneumonitis  causes  after  becoming 
RSV negative.  

  All  of  the  RSV  deaths  had  pre-existing  medical  condi-
tions--chromosomal  abnormalities  29%,  cardiac 
lesions 
27%,  neuromuscular  impairment  15%,  chronic  lung  disease 
12%,  large  airway  abnormality  9%,  and  immunodeficiency 
9%. Nineteen children (56%) had pre-existing disease in two 
or  more  organ  systems  [relative  risk  (RR)  4.38].  Predispos-
ing  risk  factors  for  death  were  pre-existing  disease  (RR 
2.36),  cardiac  anomaly  (RR  2.98)  and  nosocomial/hospital-
acquired RSV infection (RR 2.89). An interaction effect was

observed  between  pre-existing  disease,  nosocomial  RSV 
infection  and  mortality  (p<0.001).  Data  on  the  prior  receipt 
of palivizumab prophylaxis have not been reported consider-
ing  this  population  as  it  was  only  introduced  into  clinical 
practice  late  in  the  study  period  and  therefore  any  impact 
would be difficult to ascertain. 

  Von Renesse  an co-workers [22] recently focused on the 
subgroup  of  patients  ventilated  for  other  reasons  at  the  time 
of  the  RSV  infection.  Referring  to  the  risk  factors  which 
have been confirmed for severe RSV disease, 60% (n=12) of 
the  patients  in  the  group  ventilated  mechanically  showed  at 
least one additional risk factor for a severe course of the viral 
respiratory tract infection:  

-  50% (n=10) were born prematurely,  

-  20%  (n=4)  had  a  chronic  lung  disease  with  dependence 

on oxgen supplementation in the last 6 months, 

- 

In  35%  (n=7),  congenital  heart  disease  had  been  docu-
mented.  

  The frequency of pneumonia was 40% in the group venti-
lated  mechanically  and  20%  in  the  control  group.  Signifi-
cantly  more  patients  in  the  group  ventilated  mechanically 
received  antibiotic  treatment  (85%  vs.  45%,  P  =  0.008),  
and attributable  mortality was higher in  the group ventilated 
mechanically  (15%  [n  =  3]  vs.  0%  in  the  control  group,  
P = 0.231). The median length of hospitalization was 31 days 
in the group ventilated mechanically (range 4–257 days), and 
12 days in the control group (range 4–206 days, P=0.05). 

  Despite  existing  consensus  recommendations,  only  two 
of  these  high  risk  patients  (10%)  had  received  the  recom-
mended  palivizumab  prophylaxis.  Children  treated  by  long 
term  mechanical  ventilation  may  acquire  RSV  infection  by 
transmission  by  droplets  and  via  contact  to  caregivers  and 
healthcare  workers.  Fourty  percent  of  all  RSV  infections  in 
these children were nosocomial RSV infections.  

 
In  a  landmark  study  published  in  JAMA  in  2005,  Keren 
and  coworkers  [23]  confirmed  a  strong  association  between 
the  presence  of  NMI  and  the  development  of  respiratory 
failure  in  children  with  influenza  virus  infection.  This  was 
confirmed  by  a  recent  2003-2004  surveillance  study  of  
severe  paediatric  influenza  cases  (hospitalization  in  the  
PICU or death) in California: 23% (36 of 160) children had a 
neurologic disorder as an underlying condition [24].  

CONCLUSIONS 

  Taken  together,  these  data  from  the  literature  suggests 
that  

- 

In all children with neuromuscular impairment, who have 
to  be  hospitalized  with  severe  clinical  deterioration  
due  to  an  airway  infection,  at  least  one  specimen  of  
nasopharyngeal  secretions  should  be  sent  as  soon  as  
possible  to  a  virologic  laboratory  to  detect  viral  patho-
gens [25, 26].  

-  Children  with  severe  neuromuscular  impairment  and 
those  mechanically  ventilated  for  other  reasons  being 
hospitalized during the  RSV season  must be strictly pro-
tected  against  nosocomial  RSV  infection  by  means  of 
standard and droplet precautions [19, 20, 27]. 

-  Children with severe neuromuscular disease, in particular 
those  within  the  first  24  months  of  life,  should  receive 
passive  immunization  with  palivizumab  following  the  
actual recommendations [8].
