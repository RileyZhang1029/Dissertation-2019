5’-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved cellular and organismal energy 
integrator that responds to numerous stimuli with the overall intention to facilitate energy conservation and enhance energy balance 
while also aff ecting cellular survival and behaviors. AMPK has been appreciated for many years to function in peripheral organs 
that contribute to the generation or disposition of cellular energy, while its role in the brain has been only recently elucidated. While 
acknowledged to respond to organismal energy balance, we now recognize that energy balance within neurons also aff ects the brain’s 
response to these peripheral signals. In this review, we discuss AMPK’s regulation and its ever-expanding role as a neuronal energy 
integrator at both the cellular and systems levels.

INTRODUCTION

AMPK, or 5’-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein 
kinase, is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that 
plays a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis. In higher 
order eukaryotes, it is expressed in multiple systems and serves 
as an integrator of cellular and organismal energy balance and 
energy-dependent responses [1]. As its name implies, AMPK is 
activated by physiological or pathophysiological stimuli that cause 
elevations in cellular AMP concentration, as well as hormones, 
drugs, and xenobiotics. Upon activation, AMPK phosphorylates 
its targets with the goal of acutely stimulating catabolic processes 
while inhibiting anabolic processes to restore cellular energy

homeostasis, and chronically altering gene transcription and 
controlling cellular fate. In this review, we focus on recent advances 
in AMPK and energy-sensing in the brain. As the AMPK fi eld is 
rapidly growing, for further discussion of the regulation of AMPK 
and its role in coordinating various aspects of cell and whole 
organism function, readers are directed towards several recent 
reviews [1-4].

STRUCTURE AND REGULATION

AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme complex, comprised of a 
catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits. There are 
two alpha subunit genes (α1 and α2), two beta subunit genes (β1 
and β2), and three gamma subunit genes (γ1, γ2, and γ3) which 
are capable of assembling in different combinations in a tissue-
specific manner. In the rodent brain, all the isoforms have been 
detected except the γ3, which is primarily thought to be a muscle-
specifi c subunit [5,6]. Activation of the AMPK complex requires

ATP levels, it can appropriately be considered an “adenosine 
nucleotide” sensor. It has been proposed that AMPK acts at the 
cellular level through changes in adenine nucleotides via LKB1 
phosphorylation, and at the whole organism level through 
elevations in intracellular Ca2+ and CaMKKβ activation [11]. In 
addition to LKB1 and CaMKKβ, it has also been suggested that 
TAK1 (transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1) may 
serve as an upstream AMPK kinase [12, 13]. However, the exact 
mechanism of this regulation and its in vivo significance in the 
brain is less well understood. 
The list of AMPK targets that are phosphorylated upon 
activation is ever expanding [4]. These targets can be broadly 
categorized into enzymes involved in glucose and lipid metabo-
lism, protein synthesis, cell growth, autophagy, cell polarity, and 
gene transcription. Based on numerous studies, it appears that the 
overall consequence of AMPK activation is context and stimulus-
specific. Under normal physiological situations in the brain, 
AMPK serves as a master energy sensor and integrator of signals 
in response to long-term energy deficits. In pathophysiological 
situations such as ischemia, over activation of AMPK is deleteri ous.

AMPK AND REGULATION OF FOOD INTAKE AND ENERGY 
BALANCE

Early histological studies revealed that AMPK subunits are 
highly expressed in the developing and adult rodent brain 
[5, 14]. Although neurons represent a minority of cells in the 
brain, it appears that AMPK subunits are enriched in these cells 
irrespective of brain area. In particular, hypothalamic AMPK is 
proposed to be an “energy integrator” and is poised to sense not 
only cellular energy status, but also to monitor whole-organism 
energy balance.
The role of AMPK in the regulation of food intake and energy 
balance was elucidated by several groups. It was shown that 
signals such as fasting and the orexigenic hormone ghrelin, 
increased hypothalamic AMPK activity, whereas refeeding and 
the anorexigenic hormone leptin, decreased AMPK activity 
[15, 16]. As further evidence that it is indeed alterations in 
hypothalamic AMPK that mediate changes in food intake, it was 
demonstrated that direct pharmacological activation of AMPK 
by i.c.v. injection of AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-
1-β-D-ribofuranoside) or expression of a constitutively active 
AMPK adenovirus increase food intake and body weight. 
Similarly, injection of a dominant negative AMPK adenovirus 
produced a reduction in food intake and body weight. Previously, 
we developed the compound C75 (3-carboxy-4-octyl-2-
methylenebutyrolactone) as a fatty-acid synthase inhibitor/

Fig. 1. Regulation of AMPK activation. AMPK is activated under 
conditions of energy-defi cit by either physiological or pathophysiological 
signals. Signals that increase cellular AMP or ADP levels activate AMPK 
through LKB1, whereas those that raise intracellular Ca2+ activate AMPK 
through CaMKKβ. In contrast signals of energy-surplus inhibit AMPK 
activation and promote deactivation. Activated AMPK phosphorylates 
numerous targets to promote catabolic processes and inhibit anabolic 
cellular processes.

phosphorylation of the α subunit at threonine-172 (T172) in the 
kinase loop by one of two identified upstream kinases, LKB1 
(Liver kinase B1/serine threonine kinase 11) or CaMKKβ (Ca2+/
calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase β) (Fig. 1). The β subunits 
contain a carbohydrate-binding domain that acts as a cellular 
glycogen sensor. In addition, a myristoylation site in the β subunit 
has been identifi ed that is required for α subunit phosphorylation 
and allosteric activation by AMP [7, 8]. The γ subunits contain 
four cystathionine β-synthase domains arranged as tandem 
pairs (also known as CBS or Bateman domains), which serve 
as AMP, ADP, and ATP binding sites. More recently, through 
biochemical and structural studies, evidence has been provided 
that AMPK also responds to elevations in both cellular AMP 
and ADP [9]. The current model for complete activation of 
AMPK appears to have several steps. Initially, phosphorylation 
of T172 by the upstream kinase increases AMPK activity by 
several hundred-fold. Additionally, binding of AMP or ADP 
to site 1 and site 3 of the CBS domains induce further allosteric 
activation (induced by AMP alone) and protect the kinase from 
dephosphorylation (induced by both AMP and ADP) [10]. In 
this manner, several thousand-fold increases in AMPK activity 
can be achieved in the presence of elevated levels of AMP aft er α 
subunit phosphorylation. In contrast, high concentrations of ATP 
bind to the γ subunit and promote α subunit dephosphorylation 
and kinase inactivation. Therefore due to the fact that AMPK 
can directly monitor AMP and ADP levels and indirectly sense

carnitne palmitoyltransferase-1 stimulator and demonstrated its 
ability to reduce food intake and body weight in mice [17-19]. It 
was observed that C75 caused rapid profound anorexia, reversible 
weight loss, and increased peripheral energy expenditure. 
Subsequently, when examining the mechanism of action of C75, 
we determined that C75, either given i.p or i.c.v, mediates its 
effects through AMPK inhibition in the hypothalamus [20, 21]. 
We demonstrated that direct stimulation of AMPK with AICAR 
reverses the effects of C75 on AMPK inhibition and feeding 
reduction. In contrast, i.c.v. injection of the AMPK inhibitor 
compound C (6-[4-(2-Piperidin-1-yl-ethoxy)-phenyl)]-3-
pyridin-4-yl-pyrrazolo[1,5-a]-pyrimidine), reduced hypothalamic 
AMPK  activation  and  food  intake.  Furthermore,  it  was 
demonstrated the altering hypothalamic neuronal energy balance 
and inhibiting AMPK activity with C75 treatment produced 
long-term eff ects on neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene expression and 
feeding behavior, suggesting a mechanism for C75 action in the 
CNS. 
In the subsequent years, it has been demonstrated by many 
laboratories that hypothalamic AMPK can be regulated by 
numerous orexigenic signals which indicate “energy deficit” and 
anorexigenic signals which indicate “energy surplus.” Fasting, 
hypoglycemia, ghrelin, adiponectin, agouti-related peptide 
(AGRP), endocannabinoids, thyroid hormone, glucocorticoids, 
are among the orexigenic cues that increase hypothalamic AMPK 
and feeding [22-30]. In contrast, refeeding, hyperglycemia, leptin, 
insulin, resistin, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), 
ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-
1), and angiopoeitin-like protein 4 (Angpt14/Fiaf) are among the 
anorexigenic signals that inhibit hypothalamic AMPK and reduce 
food intake [15, 16, 26, 31-34].
Several transgenic and knockout mouse model systems provided 
further evidence supporting the importance of hypothalamic 
AMPK in energy balance. Initially, global deletion of either α1 or 
α2 subunits did not reveal any differences in food intake, body 
weight, or energy expenditure [35-37]. Th  is lack of central eff ect 
could be attributed to compensatory up-regulation or redundancy 
in function of the α subunits. To overcome this limitation, a 
conditional deletion approach was employed. In this regard, mice 
with a targeted deletion of α2 (on an global α1-null background) 
in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons of the arcuate (ARC) 
nucleus developed obesity and exhibited a reduced metabolic rate 
[38]. By contrast in the same study, mice with a deletion of α2 in 
agouti-relate peptide (AGRP) neurons were leaner than wild type 
mice. Unexpectedly, neurons from both of these knockout mouse 
models retained acute sensitivity to leptin and insulin signaling, 
but were blunted in their response to glucose alterations. These 

findings suggest that AMPK is important for glucose-sensing 
in POMC and AGRP neurons but is not required for hormonal 
responses. As an alternative strategy, AMPK β subunit knockout 
mouse models have also provided interesting insight into enzyme 
regulation in feeding centers. It was recently observed that mice 
with a global β1 deletion have reduced food intake, adiposity, and 
total body mass when fed either a standard or high fat diet [39]. In 
contrast, mice with a global deletion of β2 subunits that were fed a 
high fat diet gained more weight and developed hyperinsulinemia 
and glucose intolerance [40]. Th  e fi nding that each of the β subunit 
deletion mice exhibits defi ned phenotypes is interesting and may 
be explained by differential subunit expression in the various 
tissues involved in metabolic regulation (e.g, hypothalamus, 
muscle, liver, adipose tissue). Furthermore, while these knockout 
models have yielded significant and interesting findings that 
are sometimes surprising, they underscore the complexity 
of regulation of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei and 
neuronal subpopulations. To further address the role of AMPK 
in the hypothalamus, it would be useful to have conditional and 
inducible control of gene deletion in specifi c neuronal populations 
with appropriate Cre-recombinase mouse lines. It is likely that 
such tools are already in development and studies will yield 
valuable information soon. 

AMPK AND CNS ISCHEMIC STROKE

As ischemic brain injury is essentially an acute disorder of 
energy defi cit, it is not surprising that AMPK would be implicated 
in this process. Stroke injury involves multiple cellular and tissue 
stresses including hypoxia, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, calcium 
overload, and oxidative and nitrosative stresses, apoptosis, and 
necrosis [41-43]. Accumulating evidence suggests that AMPK 
is activated by various metabolic stresses in the brain and elicits 
downstream compensatory responses [44]. However, the overall 
consequence of AMPK activation appears to be dependent on the 
degree of activation, the cell-type in which it is activated and the 
specifi c metabolic status of the cell. 
In vitro, it was demonstrated that AMPK activation with a 
low dose of AICAR protects primary hippocampal neurons 
from hypoglycemic stress and glutamate excitotoxicity and 
protects primary astrocytes from ceramide-mediated apoptosis 
[14, 45]. In contrast, studies using cell lines determined that 
AICAR-stimulated AMPK activation was detrimental to overall 
cell survival in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and mouse 
neuroblastoma cells [46, 47]. Similarly, it was found that AMPK 
activation mediated by tributlyltin induced primary cortical 
neuronal cell death [48]. Furthermore, it was shown that the 

54

AMPK in the Brain

AMPK inhibitor compound C was able protect neurons from 
tributyltin toxicity. Studies from another group showed that 
AICAR could protect rat primary cortical neurons from hypoxic 
death in a concentration-dependent manner [49]. Interestingly, 
whereas low doses were neuroprotective, higher doses lost their 
effi  cacy. Most recently, another study provided further mechanistic 
insight into the role of AMPK in excitotoxic injury [50]. It was 
found that NMDA or glutamate excitotoxic stress produced 
activation of AMPK in primary cortical or cerebellar granule cells. 
Moreover, overactivation of AMPK was found to be involved in 
increased gene transcription and activation of the pro-apoptotic 
protein Bim, a Bcl-2 family member. In this regard, constitutively 
active AMPK or AICAR were found to activate an ATP-dependent 
cell death process known as “excitotoxic apoptosis.”
Based on in vitro studies, it is evident that discrepancies exist 
regarding the role of AMPK in the neuronal response to stress. 
One important consideration is that many studies typically use 
neuronal culture medium containing 25 mM glucose whereas 
the physiological concentrations of glucose in vivo have been 
estimated to be 0.82~2.4 mM [51-53]. To facilitate the study of 
AMPK, neuronal metabolism, and their responses to physiological 
and pathophysiological stress conditions we established a new 
neuronal culture system that would more closely mimic the in 
vivo situation [54]. We observed that when neurons are cultured 
in 3 mM glucose as opposed to 25 mM, they respond to metabolic 
alterations more similar to that seen in vivo. More recently, we 
have also optimized this culture paradigm by culturing cells at 5% 
O2 tension (as opposed to 21% or ambient O2 tension), which is 
more refl ective of that seen in the brain [55]. Interestingly, when 
neurons were grown in both 3 mM glucose and 5% O2 they exhibit 
increased survival, reduced reactive oxygen species, improved 
mitochondrial function. Moreover, cellular ATP levels were 
increased through increased glucose uptake and fl ux through the 
glycolytic pathway. While activated AMPK levels were elevated, 
oxidation of both glucose and fatty acids were decreased. These 
data suggest that under physiological glucose and oxygen culture 
conditions, activated AMPK is reset at a new setpoint where it is 
better poised to respond to and integrate energy fl ux signals as it 
may in vivo. 
In addition to accumulating data from in vitro experiments, 
several studies have examined the role of AMPK in ischemia 
reperfusion injury in vivo. Work from our group demonstrated 
that  AMPK  is  activated  by  oxygen-glucose  deprivation 
(OGD) stress in rat hippocampal slices [56]. Similar findings 
were observed in the mouse cortex using a middle cerebral 
artery occlusion (MCAO) model of transient focal ischemia. 
Furthermore, it was found that administration of C75, which 

inhibits AMPK indirectly, or compound C, which inhibits 
AMPK directly, produced significant reductions in infarct size 
and behavioral defects, suggesting that AMPK over-activation is 
detrimental to overall stroke outcome. Additional data to support 
the involvement of AMPK in ischemic damage was provided in 
studies using α1- or α2-deletion mice [57]. It was found that mice 
with global α2 deletion had signifi cantly smaller cortical, striatal, 
and total infarct volumes compared to wild-type mice. In contrast 
α1-deletion mice were not signifi cantly neuroprotected compared 
to wild-type controls. Furthermore, compound C, which was 
shown to be neuroprotective in WT mice, lost its effects in α2 
knockout mice. It was also found that the neuroprotective effect 
of AMPK α2 deletion was equally evident in male and female 
mice [58]. In another series of experiments, it was demonstrated 
that acute treatment with the commonly used anti-diabetic drug 
and AMPK activator, metformin, exacerbated stroke outcome 
aft er MCAO [59]. Th  is detrimental eff ect was lost in both nNOS 
and α2 knockout mice, demonstrating that over-activation of 
this pathway is harmful in ischemic injury. Most intriguingly, it 
was also shown that chronic metformin actually improved stroke 
outcome by reducing AMPK activation. It was suggested that the 
duration and degree of AMPK activation are the critical factors 
that determine cellular responses in ischemia. Based on these 
data, it was proposed that over-activation of AMPK especially 
in astrocytes enhances glycolysis and produces extreme lactic 
acidosis which exacerbates ischemic injury. However, it cannot be 
ruled out that over-activation of AMPK in neurons induces a cell-
autonomous death pathway such as autophagy [60]. Indeed it has 
recently been demonstrated that AMPK activation is a key signal 
in the initiation of this cascade [61, 62]. Although the precise 
mechanism remains unclear, accumulating in vivo data using a 
combination of genetic and pharmacological tools has shown that 
over activation of AMPK is deleterious in stroke and that AMPK 
inhibition is neuroprotective. 

OTHER ROLES OF AMPK IN THE BRAIN

While the role of AMPK in hypothalamic energy-sensing and 
ischemic/metabolic injury is well studied, recent work implicates 
AMPK in other aspects of brain physiology. As the complete 
deletion of both AMPK α subunits results in embryonic lethality, 
several authors have investigated the role of AMPK in neuronal 
development using transgenic and alternate methods. Dasgupta 
and Milbrandt generated a transgenic mouse expressing an 
inactive β1-β-galactosidase fusion protein. Th  ese mice exhibited 
a striking neurodegeneration phenotype and early post-natal 
lethality suggesting that β1 subunit is required for normal brain

development [63]. However using an alternative β1 deletion 
strategy, another group was unable to confirm these severe 
neurological defi cits [39]. Given the lack of a striking neurological 
phenotype in the α1, α2, or the β2 deletion animals, it is likely that 
the phenotype observed by Dasgupta and Milbrandt refl ects the 
expression of a β1-fusion protein rather than a β1 deletion [37, 
40]. Clearly additional studies are required to test the role of the β1 
subunit in neuronal development.
More recently, using a conditional neuronal deletion of α2 
on a whole body α1-deletion background, it was shown that 
AMPK activity is not required for cortical neuron development 
but regulates axon formation during metabolic stress [64]. It 
was also shown that overactivation of AMPK during a critical 
phase of neuronal development inhibits polarization through 
phosphorylation of KIf5 and disruption of PI3-kinase transport in 
growing axons [65]. Th  ese data also lend support to the notion that 
over-activation of AMPK in neurons is detrimental and suggest a 
mechanism of damage to developing neurons in conditions such 
as perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. 
AMPK has also been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer’s (AD) and Huntington’s disease (HD) [66, 
67]. In this regard, it has been shown that there is overactivation 
of AMPK in striatal neurons in a transgenic mouse model of 
HD. More recently, a mechanism was identified by which the 
α1 subunit abnormally translocates to the nucleus to mediate 
neurotoxicity via suppression of expression of the anti-apoptotic 
protein Bcl2. It was also found that a pharmacological agent 
that ameliorates HD symptoms acts in part by preventing α1 
translocation to the nucleus.
The role of AMPK in the pathogenesis of AD is less clear. 
Initially, it was demonstrated that AMPK activation, either 
directly or indirectly, inhibits tau phosphorylation in rat cortical 
neurons [68]. In contrast, others demonstrated that AMPK could 
phosphorylate tau on multiple sites and disrupt the binding of tau 
to microtubules [69,70]. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that 
exposure of mouse cortical neurons to amyloid β peptide (a.a. 
1-42) induced Ca2+-CaMKKβ-dependent activation of AMPK 
and hyperphosphorylation of tau. In human patients it was 
observed that AMPK is abnormally activated and translocalized 
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in AD tangles as well as other 
tauopathies [70]. Thus it is evident that although AMPK is 
activated in the Alzheimer’s tangle formation process, it is not yet 
established if this is a primary cause or a cellular response in an 
attempt to repair disordered metabolic balance and signaling. 
Other studies have examined the role of AMPK on amyloid 
plaques, the other major component of AD pathology. Several 
studies in this field have shown that AMPK activation represses 

amyloidogenesis in neurons [68, 71, 72]. Furthermore, it was 
observed that amyloid-β production is increased in cortical 
neurons from AMPK α2 knockout mice, whereas activators of 
AMPK such as AICAR and resveratrol are able to reduce Aβ 
production and facilitate its clearance. As Alzheimer’s disease is 
a complex neurodegenerative process encompassing numerous 
molecular players, a complete understanding of its details is 
lacking. However, based on accumulating data over the past few 
years, it is likely that AMPK plays an important role in several 
aspects of AD pathogenesis. Therefore, selective modulation of 
AMPK signaling may be a potential consideration for AD therapy. 

CONCLUSION

AMPK is a multi-functional energy sensor in many organ sys-
tems. In the hypothalamus, AMPK serves as an energy integrator 
which responds to signaling by hormonal and nutrient cues. In 
pathological conditions such as stroke and neurodegenerative 
diseases, its overactivation is deleterious. Information from 
various transgenic and knockout AMPK mouse model systems 
will help to elucidate precise cellular mechanisms of AMPK 
activation in both normal and pathophysiology. Due to the fact 
the AMPK is implicated in a variety of processes, it is a valuable 
pharmacological target by either or indirect manipulation.
