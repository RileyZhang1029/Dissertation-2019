More than 170 million individuals are currently infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) world-
wide and are at continuous risk of developing chronic liver disease. Since a cell culture
system enabling relatively efﬁcient propagation of HCV has become available, an increas-
ing number of viral and host factors involved in HCV particle formation have been identiﬁed.
Association of the viral Core, which forms the capsid with lipid droplets appears to be pre-
requisite for early HCV morphogenesis. Maturation and release of HCV particles is tightly
linked to very-low-density lipoprotein biogenesis. Although expression of Core as well as
E1 and E2 envelope proteins produces virus-like particles in heterologous expression sys-
tems, there is increasing evidence that non-structural viral proteins and p7 are also required
for the production of infectious particles, suggesting that HCV genome replication and
virion assembly are closely linked. Advances in our understanding of the various molecular
mechanisms by which infectious HCV particles are formed are summarized.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic
hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is
primarily transmitted by blood-borne routes, including shared
needles and transfused blood products. The WHO estimates that
a minimum of 2–3% of the world’s population is chronically
infected with HCV (Wasley and Alter, 2000). Despite the fact that
HCV is targeted by innate, cellular, and humoral immune mecha-
nisms, it establishes long-standing persistent infection in a major-
ity of the people that it infects (Pawlotsky, 2006). HCV belongs
to the genus Hepacivirus within the Flaviviridae family. The virus
forms small round-shaped particles ranging from 50 to 80 nm in
diameter. The mature HCV virion is thought to consist of a nucle-
ocapsid, an outer envelope composed of E1 and E2 viral proteins,
and a lipid membrane. HCV particles isolated from the sera of
infected patients demonstrate heterogeneity in their density. Den-
sity gradient analyses have shown that viral RNA exists within
both low- and high-density fractions (Andre et al., 2005), and that
the low-density fractions contain lipoproteins that associate with
apolipoprotein B (ApoB), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), triglycerides,
and cholesterol, as well as viral structural proteins (Thomssen et al.,
1992; Andre et al., 2002; Maillard et al., 2006; Nielsen et al., 2006).
Only the low-density fraction derived from HCV-positive human
serum exhibits high infectivity in chimpanzees (Bradley et al.,
1991; Beach et al., 1992). Since the establishment of a robust tis-
sue culture infection system using strain HCV JFH-1 (Lindenbach
et al., 2005; Wakita et al., 2005; Zhong et al., 2005), the entire HCV
lifecycle has been studied and the biophysical properties of the viral
particles produced using the HCVcc cell culture system have been
characterized. Most viral RNA-containing particles secreted from
HCV-infected cells are poorly infectious and fractionate at high
densities such as ∼1.14 g/mL, while highly infectious HCVcc are
found within low-density fractions of ∼1.10 g/mL (Lindenbach
et al., 2005).

Here, we provide a general account of our current understand-
ing of the HCV lifecycle and a review of recent studies focusing on
the morphogenesis of HCV particles within cell culture systems.

HCV GENOME ORGANIZATION AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS
Hepatitis C virus is a positive-stranded RNA virus, and its ∼9.6-kb
genome contains an open reading frame encoding a polypro-
tein of ∼3000 amino acids (aa) ﬂanked by untranslated regions
(UTRs) at both ends. Six genotypes have been reported based on
HCV genome sequence variations (Simmonds, 1996). The UTRs
are highly structured sequences encompassing critical cis-active
RNA elements essential for genome replication and translation.
(cid:2)
The 5
UTR, which is ∼341 nucleotides (nt) in length, con-
tains an internal ribosomal entry site, which is a prerequisite
for cap-independent translation of viral RNA, from which four
highly structured domains (I–IV) are produced (Bukh et al., 1992;
Tsukiyama-Kohara et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1993; Honda et al.,
1996; Friebe et al., 2001). The 3
UTR varies between 200 and
235 nt in length, including a short variable region, as well as a
poly(U/UC) tract with an average length of 80 nt which is consid-
ered crucial for RNA replication, and a virtually invariant 98-nt
X-tail region (Tanaka et al., 1995; Ito and Lai, 1999; Friebe and
Bartenschlager, 2002; Yi and Lemon, 2003).

(cid:2)

The genome is translated into a single precursor polyprotein,
which is processed by cellular and viral proteases into 10 structural
and non-structural proteins (Core, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A,
NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B; Figure 1). HCV proteins derived from
the amino-terminal third of the precursor include Core, E1 and
E2 structural proteins. A crucial function of Core protein is assem-
bly of the viral nucleocapsid. The aa sequence of this protein is well
conserved among different HCV strains compared to other HCV
proteins. The non-structural (NS) proteins NS3-NS5B are thought
to assemble into a membrane-associated HCV RNA replicase com-
plex. NS3 functions as serine protease, RNA helicase, and NTPase.

Assembly of HCV

2002; Suzuki et al., 2005). Following is a proposed mechanism of
translocation of Core to membranes within the ER network such
as LDs (McLauchlan et al., 2002; Schwer et al., 2004). After being
processed by a signal peptide peptidase, a large part of the Core
remains within cytoplasmic leaﬂets of the ER membrane due to
preservation of the original transmembrane domain. The cyto-
plasmic leaﬂets then swell as lipid accumulates between the two
membrane leaﬂets. As a result, the Core is translocated along with
part of the ER membrane to the surface of a nascent LD before the
droplet buds off the ER. The proteasome-dependent degradation
pathway then participates in post-translational modiﬁcation of the
Core (Suzuki et al., 2001, 2009; Moriishi et al., 2003, 2007, 2010;
Shirakura et al., 2007). Ubiquitin ligase E6AP and proteasome
activator PA28gamma are key regulators in determining the fate
of the Core, and thereby play a role in virus production (Shirakura
et al., 2007; Moriishi et al., 2010).

The ∼120 N-terminal residues of the Core protein (domain I)
contain multiple positively charged residues that are implicated
in RNA binding and homo-oligomerization. It is therefore likely
that this domain is a prerequisite for assembly of the HCV nucle-
ocapsid (Kunkel et al., 2001; Klein et al., 2004, 2005; Majeau et al.,
2004). It has been shown that a region extending from aa 72 to 91 is
responsible for auto-oligomerization of Core (Nakai et al., 2006).
Although conclusive data for direct packaging of the HCV genome
into the viral capsid is lacking, the viral RNA sequence of the Core
protein through to the NS2 region appears not to contain a cis-
acting packaging signal. A subgenomic replicon RNA carrying the
NS3–NS5B region can be encapsidated in the viral trans-packaging
system (Ishii et al., 2008; Steinmann et al., 2008; Adair et al., 2009;
Masaki et al., 2010). In addition, the RNA sequence encoding the
ﬁrst 62 aa of Core contains highly conserved structures including
two stem-loops that are important for RNA translation/replication
(McMullan et al., 2007). Domain II (aa ∼120–170) is predicted to
form two alpha-helices that enable Core to associate with mem-
brane proteins and lipids. Domain II is involved in targeting of
Core to LDs. It has been proposed that domain II folding occurs in
a membrane environment and is critical for the folding of domain
I (Boulant et al., 2005). In addition, a cysteine residue at aa 128
of domain II creates a disulﬁde bond to produce a Core protein
dimer that is required for particle formation (Kushima et al., 2010).
Domain III, pertaining to ∼20 residues at the C-terminal, is highly
hydrophobic and serves as a signal sequence for E1. Although little
is known about the molecular mechanisms governing assembly of
Core into nucleocapsids, comprehensive mutagenesis studies have
enabled identiﬁcation of various aa residues which are essential
for HCV morphogenesis (Murray et al., 2007; Alsaleh et al., 2010;
Kopp et al., 2010).

INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER HCV PROTEINS IN ASSEMBLY
Two N-glycosylated envelope proteins E1 and E2 are exposed on
the surface of the virus as a heterodimer that mediates viral attach-
ment to host-cell receptors and facilitates virus entry (Op De
Beeck et al., 2004; Vieyres et al., 2010). During their synthesis,
E1 and E2 assemble as non-covalent heterodimers. Ectodomains
of E1 and E2 are translocated inside the ER lumen and their
transmembrane domains are inserted in the membrane of this
compartment. E1 contains four to ﬁve N-linked glycans and E2

FIGURE 1 | The HCV genome and polyprotein. The RNA genome
comprises a 9.6-kb RNA of plus strand polarity. Post-translational cleavages
by SPP (signal peptide peptidase), SP (signal peptidase), NS2-3 pro
(NS2–NS3 cysteine protease), and NS3 pro/4A (NS3 serine protease and
NS4A complex) lead to the production of functional HCV proteins.
Functions of each protein in the viral lifecycle are indicated below the open
reading frame.

NS4A serves as a cofactor for NS3 and is involved in targeting NS3
to the ER membrane (Wolk et al., 2000). NS4B plays a role in the
remodeling of host-cell membranes, probably to generate a site
for replicase assembly. NS5A is also thought to play an important
but undeﬁned role in viral RNA replication. NS5B functions as an
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The role of HCV NS proteins
in assembly of the infectious virion is described below.

CORE PROTEIN AND NUCLEOCAPSID FORMATION
The Core is 191 aa in length and consists of three distinct predicted
domains: an N-terminal domain that is two-thirds hydrophilic, a
C-terminal domain that is one-third hydrophobic, and a short sig-
nal peptide sequence of the downstream protein E1. The precursor
Core is cleaved between Core and E1 by a host signal peptidase.
A C-terminal membrane-anchor of the Core is further cleaved
by a signal peptide peptidase. The mature Core is estimated to
be 177–179 aa (Ogino et al., 2004; Okamoto et al., 2004). Mat-
uration of the Core by a signal peptide peptidase is required for
virion production (Okamoto et al., 2008; Targett-Adams et al.,
2008). Biophysical techniques have been used to demonstrate
that the mature Core is a dimeric alpha-helical protein (Boulant
et al., 2005). Its aa sequence is highly conserved among different
HCV strains, compared with other HCV proteins. Thus, Core is
used in most serologic assays since anti-core antibodies are highly
prevalent among HCV-infected individuals.

Core has been detected in a number of subcellular compart-
ments. Core protein is found on ER membranes, on the surface
of lipid droplets (LDs), on the mitochondrial outer membrane,
and to some extent, in the nucleus (Moradpour et al., 1996; Barba
et al., 1997; Moriya et al., 1998; Yasui et al., 1998; Hope et al.,

has 11 N-glycosylation sites. HCV glycans, which are thought to
contain a mixture of complex and high mannose side-chain, play a
role in envelope protein folding and formation of the E1/E2 com-
plexes. The importance of incorporating N-linked glycans of the
envelope proteins into infectious virions has been demonstrated
(Helle et al., 2010). A recent study has shown that HCV infection
activates the ER-associated degradation pathway, which in turn
controls the fate of E1 and E2 and modulates virus production
(Saeed et al., 2011).

A role of viral NS proteins in HCV production was ﬁrst
suggested following the observation that JFH-1-derived NS pro-
teins are required to generate infectious virus from intra- and
inter-genotype chimeric constructs (Lindenbach et al., 2005;
Pietschmann et al., 2006). Evidence supporting a role of NS2, NS3,
and NS5A in the assembly or release of infectious HCV has come
from mutational analyses (Jones et al., 2007; Miyanari et al., 2007;
Appel et al., 2008; Jirasko et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2008; Masaki et al.,
2008; Tellinghuisen et al., 2008).

NS5A is a hydrophilic phosphoprotein which plays a key role
in viral RNA replication and is involved in modulation of cell sig-
naling pathways and the interferon response (Huang et al., 2007).
NS5A is associated with membrane mediated by a unique amphi-
pathic alpha helix which is located at its N-terminus (Moradpour
et al., 2005), and part of NS5A localizes to LDs when expressed
alone or as the viral polyprotein (Shi et al., 2002). Experiments
based on HCV genomes containing mutated NS5A have shown
that some mutants result in failure of association of NS5A with
LDs and failure of production of infectious particles (Miyanari
et al., 2007). Further studies have revealed that the C-terminal
region of NS5A plays a key role in HCV production (Appel et al.,
2008; Masaki et al., 2008; Tellinghuisen et al., 2008). Substitu-
tions at a serine cluster of the NS5A C-terminus (aa 2428, 2430,
and 2433) which have no impact on viral RNA replication, have
been observed to inhibit the interaction between NS5A and Core,
thereby suggesting that an association between NS5A and Core
might be involved in virus production (Masaki et al., 2008). Struc-
tural analyses have shown that the N-terminal region of NS5A
forms a “claw-like” dimer, which might accommodate RNA and
interact with viral and cellular proteins and membranes (Huang
et al., 2005; Tellinghuisen et al., 2005). It appears that recruitment
of NS5A to LDs, thereby enabling interaction with the Core, is
crucial for virion assembly. One can imagine that newly synthe-
sized HCV RNA bound to NS5A is released from the replication
complex-containing membrane compartment and can then be
captured by Core through interaction with the C-terminal region
of NS5A at the surface of LDs or LD-associated membranes. Con-
sequently, viral RNA becomes encapsidated and virion assembly
proceeds (Figure 2). In this regard, a study has revealed an inter-
action between NS5A and ApoE, suggesting that recruitment of
ApoE by NS5A is important for the assembly and release of HCV
particles (Benga et al., 2010).

NS3–NS4A is another component of the viral replication com-
plex that exhibits serine protease, as well as RNA helicase and
RNA-stimulated NTPase activity, necessary for viral RNA replica-
tion. It is now apparent that NS3–NS4A also contributes to viral
assembly (Yi et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2008; Han et al., 2009; Phan
et al., 2011). A previous study has provided genetic evidence that

FIGURE 2 | Proposed model for assembly of HCV particles. After
accumulation of synthesized genome RNA and the viral proteins, the HCV
particles are assembled in an ER-related compartment in close connection
with the VLDL pathway. The viral replication complex, which is composed of
NS3–NS5B and host factors, is a specialized structure protected by cellular
membrane. Newly synthesized viral RNAs are recruited to surfaces of lipid
droplet (LD), where ER membrane is associated, possibly via interaction
between NS5A and Core. Thus, the RNAs enable to associate with Core,
thereby proceeding encapsidation and nucleocapsid formation. The
nucleocapsid is presumably inserted into the lipid core of the luminal LD
and buds into the ER lumen with incorporation of E1 and E2.
HCV–lipoprotein particle formed is then released from the cells.

two major subdomains of the NS3 helicase, one demonstrating
NTPase activity and the other associated with RNA binding, are
involved in the early stages of virion assembly, independent of
their roles as enzymes (Ma et al., 2008). A separate investigation
has revealed a contribution of the acidic domain of NS4A to both
RNA replication and virus assembly (Phan et al., 2011).

NS2 is a cysteine protease composed of a highly hydropho-
bic N-terminal membrane binding domain which forms either
three or four transmembrane helices that insert into the ER mem-
brane. NS2 also contains a C-terminal globular and cytosolic
protease subdomain, that produce zinc-stimulated NS2/3 auto-
protease activity together with the N-terminal one-third of NS3.

Assembly of HCV

Mutagenesis of NS2 has identiﬁed regions or residues that are
important for infectious virus production (Jones et al., 2007; Yi
et al., 2007, 2009; Jirasko et al., 2008, 2010; Dentzer et al., 2009;
Phan et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2011; Popescu et al., 2011). For example,
mutations involving the dimer interface of the protease region or
the C-terminus of NS2 impair the production of infectious HCV,
while the catalytic activity of NS2 is not required for viral assem-
bly. Genetic and biochemical data demonstrate that NS2 is possibly
involved in multiple interactions with both HCV structural and
NS proteins including E1–E2, p7, NS3, and NS5A, suggesting that
NS2 has a role in recruiting these viral proteins to sites in close
proximity with LDs. Alternatively, it may act as a scaffold promot-
ing virus assembly (Jirasko et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2011; Stapleford
and Lindenbach, 2011).

p7 is a 63-aa polypeptide located between E2 and NS2, and is a
membrane-spanning protein localized within the ER. p7 belongs
to a class of viral permeability-altering proteins termed “viro-
porins.” It behaves as an ion channel when reconstituted into
artiﬁcial lipid membranes. Although p7 is not required for viral
RNA replication in cell culture, the protein is essential for HCV
infectivity in chimpanzees (Sakai et al., 2003). Subsequent analy-
ses in HCVcc systems have demonstrated that p7 is important for
virion production since the introduction of p7 mutations, such as
mutations in the basic residues required for its ion channel activ-
ity, impair virus production (Jones et al., 2007; Steinmann et al.,
2007; Brohm et al., 2009). Although it is not yet clear whether
the ion channel function of the protein is needed for virus assem-
+
bly, a recent study has demonstrated that p7 functions as an H
channel in native intracellular membranes and links p7-induced
pH changes to the production of infectious intracellular virions
(Wozniak et al., 2010).

ROLE OF LIPID METABOLISM IN HCV ASSEMBLY
HCVcc contained within low-density fractions from the culture
supernatant of virus-producing cells displays greater speciﬁc infec-
tivity than virus in high-density fractions (Lindenbach et al.,
2005; Ogawa et al., 2009). Looking also at the behavior of HCV
circulating within the sera of infected hosts, it may be that low-
density virus associates with lipid and very-low-density lipopro-
tein (VLDL) and/or low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Furthermore,
HCV particles obtained from virus-infected animals, such as chim-
panzees and chimeric mice transplanted with human hepatocytes,
demonstrate greater infectivity than virus produced in cell cul-
tures. The virus populations derived from these infected animals
have been observed to fractionate into lower density fractions than
a major population of HCVcc (Lindenbach et al., 2006). Interest-
ingly, the association of cholesterol and sphingolipid with HCV
virions has been shown to play a critical role in viral infectiv-
ity (Kapadia et al., 2007; Aizaki et al., 2008; Voisset et al., 2008).
Depletion of cholesterol and sphingomyelin from HCV virions
inhibits the infectivity of HCVcc (Aizaki et al., 2008). The struc-
tural requirement of virion-associated cholesterol for infectivity,
as well as its inﬂuence on buoyant density, and the association
of apolipoprotein with HCV, has been further demonstrated by
Yamamoto et al. (2011).

There is accumulating evidence that assembly and secretion of
HCV particles are associated with the VLDL assembly pathway.

Lipoproteins can be differentiated on the basis of their density,
which is affected by lipid content and the types of apolipopro-
tein they contain. VLDLs are large triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
(30–80 nm in diameter) containing cholesterol, cholesteryl esters,
ApoB, and other minor apolipoprotein(s). VLDLs carry triglyc-
eride from the liver to peripheral tissue for storage and to pro-
vide a source of energy. Triglyceride availability and the size of
intracellular triglyceride pools are important regulatory factors
in the regulation of VLDL production. In addition, the microso-
mal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which is responsible for
the transport of triglyceride and cholesteryl esters across ER mem-
branes, is required for VLDL assembly. Puriﬁed membrane vesicles
containing the HCV replication complex are enriched with ApoB,
MTP, and ApoE (Huang et al., 2007). Moreover, agents that inhibit
VLDL assembly also inhibit HCV secretion from cells producing
infectious virus (Chang et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2007; Gastaminza
et al., 2008). ApoB, ApoC1, and ApoE have been observed to asso-
ciate with HCV particles during viral morphogenesis in the HCVcc
system (Chang et al., 2007; Meunier et al., 2008; Jiang and Luo,
2009; Owen et al., 2009; Benga et al., 2010). Furthermore, ApoE
depletion suppresses the production of infectious HCV (Chang
et al., 2007; Jiang and Luo, 2009; Owen et al., 2009; Benga et al.,
2010; Hishiki et al., 2010). These ﬁndings demonstrate that ApoE
is important for HCV infectivity, suggesting that HCV virions
are assembled as ApoE-enriched lipoprotein particles. A study in
which virion-associated cholesterol was depleted and replenished
with exogenous sterol analogs has provided evidence that virion-
associated cholesterol contributes to the interaction between HCV
and ApoE (Yamamoto et al., 2011). ApoE is a polymorphic protein
with three major isoforms: ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4. Differential
roles of ApoE isoforms on infectious HCV production have been
revealed: ectopic expression of ApoE3 or ApoE4 enables recov-
ery of infectious HCV, while ApoE2 has little inﬂuence on virus
production (Hishiki et al., 2010). Not surprisingly, ApoE2 demon-
strates signiﬁcantly less LDL receptor binding activity than ApoE3
and ApoE4 (Davignon et al., 1988).

Hepatitis C virus may utilize the assembly and secretion of
VLDL to exit cells. In fact, secretion of E1 and E2 within the cul-
ture supernatant is reduced by treatment with MTP inhibitors
(Icard et al., 2009). VLDL maturation occurs by acquisition of
lipids from LDs either in the ER lumen or in the Golgi apparatus.
It is likely that HCV envelopment takes place in a lipid-enriched
microdomain at the ER membrane where luminal LDs or VLDL
precursors are generated (Figure 2), in keeping with evidence of
increased cholesterol content among HCV particles compared to
host-cell membranes (Aizaki et al., 2008).

Neutral lipids such as triglycerides and cholesterol esters are
stored within cytosolic LD in cells. LD is thought to be a source
of neutral lipid for metabolism and membrane synthesis. Neutral
lipids form the LD core and are surrounded by an outer layer of
amphipathic lipids such as phospholipids and cholesterol. LD is
thought to be surrounded by a lipid monolayer. Prior to the avail-
ability of a tissue culture system for virion production, HCV Core
was shown to associate with ER membranes and on the surface
of LDs in heterologous expression systems in mammalian cells
(Moradpour et al., 1996; Barba et al., 1997). Early studies of cells
infected with HCV JFH-1 indicate that Core is detectable at the ER

Assembly of HCV

and on the surface of LDs in association with the ER (Rouille et al.,
2006). Core associates with LDs in a time-dependent manner and
disruption of this process coincides with a loss of virion produc-
tion (Boulant et al., 2007). It has subsequently been demonstrated
that LDs are directly involved in the production of infectious HCV
and that Core recruits viral non-structural proteins as well as the
replication complex to the LD-associated membranes, suggesting
that the association between Core and LDs is required at a certain
stage of HCV morphogenesis (Miyanari et al., 2007). Fluorescent
labeling and functional imaging of Core in living cells has recently
been used to visualize Core during HCV assembly (Counihan
et al., 2011). Core has been observed to move to the surface of
large, immobile LDs soon after protein translation. Core has also
been observed in motile puncta that travel along microtubules.
Diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs) catalyze the ﬁnal step of
triglyceride synthesis and are crucial for LD biogenesis. A study
has revealed that DGAT1 interacts with Core and is required for
trafﬁcking of the Core to LD. Disrupting translocation of the Core
to LD by inhibiting DGAT1 activity or through knockdown of the
DGAT1 gene impairs virus production (Herker et al., 2010). Thus,
there is now increasing evidence that LDs play a central role in the
production of infectious HCV and participate in virus assembly.
However, one study has demonstrated that, while Core derived
from HCV JFH-1 is strongly associated with cytoplasmic LDs,
minimal Core from a HCV clone with higher assembly efﬁciency
is detectable on LDs (Shavinskaya et al., 2007). Thus, it remains
debatable whether HCV assembly is initiated on the surface of
LDs or at sites where ER cisternae are in contact with LDs. Based
on the current evidence, a model for nucleocapsid formation fol-
lowing the initial phase of assembly is demonstrated in Figure 2.
Two potential models to explain HCV nucleocapsid formation,

including the model shown in Figure 2, have been proposed by
Bartenschlager et al. (2011).

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Evidence regarding the assembly of infectious HCV particles has
accumulated over the past several years since the availability of
HCVcc systems. A variety of key factors in HCV morphogenesis
have been identiﬁed, including the requirement for components of
the VLDL biosynthetic machinery and viral NS proteins. However,
there are still essential questions to be answered. Detailed mecha-
nisms pertaining to nucleotide formation, genome packaging, and
the way in which HCV interacts with the lipoprotein/VLDL path-
way, as well as the precise role of various NS proteins and p7 in
HCV assembly, remain unclear. Structural studies will be impor-
tant to clarify the exact composition of the HCV virion, as well
as similarities and differences between HCVcc generated in Huh-
7-derived cells and the “lipoviroparticles” produced by circulating
virus within infected individuals.
