Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is

for cell morphology and
migration. One of
the key molecules
that regulates actin remodeling is the
small GTPase Rho. Rho shuttles between
the inactive GDP-bound form and the
active GTP-bound form, and works as
a molecular switch in actin remodeling
in response to both extra- and intra-
cellular stimuli. Mammalian homolog of
Diaphanous (mDia) is one of the Rho
effectors and produces unbranched actin
filaments. While Rho GTPases activate
mDia,
the mechanisms of how the
activity of mDia is downregulated in cells
remains largely unknown. In our recent
paper, we identified Liprin-a as an mDia
interacting protein and found that
Liprin-a negatively regulates the activity
of mDia in the cell by displacing it from
the plasma membrane through binding
to the DID-DD region of mDia. Here,
we review these findings and discuss
how Liprin-a regulates the Rho-mDia
pathway and how the mDia-Liprin-a
complex functions in vivo.

Introduction

Actin nucleators. Temporal and spatial
remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton plays
a central role in cell morphology, polarity,
migration and cytokinesis. However, since
there are many factors that
inhibit de
novo actin nucleation in cells, spontaneous
nucleation of G-actin (globular-actin) to
form actin filaments is very slow. Thus,
distinct nucleators are required to promote
actin filament formation in cells. Recent
works have shown that there are various
proteins that are capable of stimulating

actin nucleation and/or polymerization,
including formins, Arp2/3 complex, spire,
cordon-blue (COBL), leiomodin (LMOD),
junction-mediating and -regulatory pro-
tein (JMY) (Fig. 1).1,2 These distinct actin
nucleators employ different actin nucleat-
ing mechanisms. Arp2/3 binds
to the
side of pre-existing actin filaments and
generates branched actin filament net-
works. Spire, COBL and LMOD are new
classes of proteins that contain between
one and four G-actin-binding motifs,
including WASP-homology 2 (WH2)
domain. Their nucleation mechanisms of
unbranched actin filaments are related,
but each may generate an actin nucleus
with distinct properties. Spire stably asso-
ciates with four actin monomers
in a
prenucleation complex, and remains asso-
ciated at the side of the pointed end of
an actin filament after nucleation, allow-
free barbed end elongation.
ing
COBL uses
three WH2 domains and
stabilizes both short-pitch and long-pitch
associations to generate actin polymeriza-
tion nuclei while, LMOD uses a single
WH2 domain along with two unrelated
actin binding domains to assemble tri-
meric actin nuclei and might
remain
associated at their pointed end. Further-
more JMY nucleates actin by both acti-
vating Arp2/3 and assembling filaments
directly using a spire-like mechanism.

Three mDia isoforms, mDia1, mDia2 and
mDia3, are expressed in mammalian cells.

terminus
mDia is auto-inhibited via intra-molecular
interaction between DID and DAD,
which inhibits the ability of FH1-FH2
to nucleate and elongate actin filaments
in vitro and in vivo. In response to intra-
or extra-cellular stimuli the inactive GDP-
bound form of Rho is converted to active
GTP-bound form and binding of acti-
vated Rho to GBD disrupts the DID-
DAD interaction and leads to activation
of mDia.6 Activated mDia then induces
actin polymerization through the FH1-
FH2 domain.

formins

Although activation mechanisms of
formins are thus well characterized, inacti-
vation mechanisms of
remain
poorly understood. Intriguingly, whereas
purified formins remain bound to and
elongate the barbed end for many minutes
to produce long filaments, actin cables
and the cytokinetic ring assembled by
yeast formins in vivo are comprised of

relatively short filaments of 0.3–2.3 mm in
length.10-14 These findings indicate that
the function of mDia is crucially regulated
in the cell. Recently, three formin-binding
proteins with inhibitory actions have been
identified, they are, Dia-interacting pro-
tein (DIP), Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bud14
and Drosophila melanogaster Spire.15-17 DIP
specifically inhibits mDia2-mediated actin
nucleaction and bundling activity in vitro
by direct binding to FH2 domain. Bud14
also binds to the FH2 domain of yeast
formin Bnr1 and displaces Bnr1 from
growing barbed ends in vitro, and regu-
lates actin cable length and architecture in
vitro. The kinase noncatalytic C-lobe
domain of Spire binds to the FH2 domain
of D. melanogaster formin Cappuccino and
strongly inhibits actin nucleation by the
FH2 domain in vitro. Thus, all of these
formin binding proteins inhibit formin-
mediated actin polymerization by blocking
the FH2 domain.

Notably, release of auto-inhibition by
activated Rho is suggested to induce not
only actin polymerizing activity but also
membrane localization of mDia in the

distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm,
membrane targeting of mDia molecules
has been studied using truncation frag-
ments.18,19 Such studies have revealed that
membrane localization of mDia is mediated
through its DID-DD-CC regions in addi-
tion to its binding to Rho.19-22 These
results suggest that, in addition to regula-
tion by Rho, the activity and localization
of mDia are regulated by its interaction
with DID-DD-CC-binding proteins.

In our recent paper, we searched for
mDia-binding proteins by pull-down
assay with GBD-DID-DD regions of
mDia1 as a bait in mouse brain lysates,
and identified Liprin-a as an mDia-
binding protein.23 Moreover, we showed
that Liprin-a controls mDia-mediated
actin stress fiber formation through regu-
lating its membrane localization.

Liprin Family Proteins

Liprin family. Liprin was first identified
as an interacting protein of the leukocyte

common antigen-related (LAR) family of
receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase in
1995.24 Liprin is composed of the coiled-
and
coil domain in the N-terminus
three consecutive sterile-a-motif
(SAM)
(often referred to as Liprin
domains
homology domain)
in the C-terminus
(Fig. 3). The second SAM domain of
liprin-a interacts with the intracellular
domain of LAR. Liprin is a large family
of proteins that are classified into three
types: Liprin-a, Liprin-β and KazrinE
(Fig. 4). Vertebrate contain four Liprin-
(β1, 2) and
as (a1–4),
KazrinE. Drosophila and Xenopus also
have three types of Liprins: Liprin-a, β,
and c. KazrinE and Liprin-c have been
recently identified as a third type of
protein related to the Liprin family.25-28
Among four isoforms of Kazrin (KazrinA,
B, C and E) only KazrinE contains the
Liprin-a homology domain.27 In mam-
mals, Liprin-a1, Liprin-β1 and β2 are
expressed ubiquitously, whereas, Liprin-a2
and a3 are mainly expressed in the brain,
and Liprin-a4 is in the brain, heart and

two Liprin-βs

skeletal muscle.25 In contrast, C. elegans
contains only one Liprin-a, called syd-2
(synapse defective-2), which shares 50%
identity to human Liprin-a1.

Function of Liprin-a. In cultured cells,
Liprin-a was suggested to be involved in
LAR distribution and clustering.25 Recent
studies have shown that depletion of
endogenous Liprin-a1 decreases migration
and spreading of cultured cells, whereas
the overexpression of the protein increased
cell migration and spreading.29,30

Functions of Liprin-a have been well
studied in neuronal cells. Liprin-a works
as a scaffold and is important for pre-
synaptic as well as postsynaptic develop-
ment. Presynaptically, Liprin-a interacts
with a diverse array of proteins such as
RIM1a and ERC family that regulate the
formation of the active zone.31,32 Loss of
function mutants of the C. elegans syd-2
result in a diffuse distribution of presyn-
aptic markers, lengthening of the presyn-
aptic active zone, and impairment of
synaptic transmission in the presynapse.33
Similarly, Dliprin-a,

binds
the MALS/Veli-Cask-Mint1 scaf-
folding complex that regulates cycling of
reverse synaptic vesicles into the readily
releasable pool of synaptic vesicles that are
primed to fuse with the presynaptic
membrane.35 These results demonstrate
that Liprin-a is important for formation of
the presynaptic active zone and regulation
of neurotransmitter release. In addition,
Dliprin-a is shown to be important for
the formation of new synaptic boutons at
the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and
R1-R6 and R7 photoreceptor axon target-
ing.36,37 Postsynaptically, Liprin-a is neces-
sary for proper postsynaptic
targeting
of AMPA receptor and dendritic spine

interact with KIF1A, a neuron-specific
kinesin-3, and promotes the delivery of
synaptic material by a direct increase in
kinesin processivity and an indirect sup-
pression of dynein activation.39,40

About Our Paper

In our recent work, we identified Liprin-a
as a novel mDia-binding protein.23 The
binding is mediated through the central
region of Liprin-a and through the DID-
DD regions of mDia (Fig. 3). Liprin-a
competes with DAD for binding to DID,
and binds preferably to the open form of
mDia. Pull down analysis suggests that
Liprin-a does not form a ternary complex
with active RhoA and mDia. Therefore,
we suggest a model for the mDia-Liprin-a
interaction, that Liprin-a binds to mDia
after active RhoA opens mDia and is
dissociated from it. Given the popular
opinion that mDia isoforms are main-
tained in an inactive state in the cytosol
and then recruited to the plasma mem-
brane upon activation where they catalyze
actin polymerization, we examined the
effect of Liprin-a on the actin cytoskeleton
and the membrane localization of mDia.3
Overexpression of a Liprin-a fragment
the mDia1-binding
containing
region
attenuated
the Rho-mDia mediated
formation of stress fibers, and decreased
localization of mDia at the plasma mem-
brane. Conversely, depletion of Liprin-a
by RNA interference enhanced formation

of actin stress fibers and increased the
amount of mDia
in the membrane
fraction. Taken together, we conclude that
Liprin-a negatively regulates the activity
of mDia in the cell by displacing it from
the plasma membrane through binding
to the DID-DD region and regulates
the amounts of Rho-mDia-mediated actin
stress fibers in the cell.

Molecular mechanisms. As we have now
shown, mDia1 is recruited to the mem-
brane in response to serum stimulation.
We also found recruitment of Liprin-a to
the membrane fraction at a slower late
than mDia1 (data not
shown). These
results imply that Liprin-a activity may
also be regulated downstream of serum
stimuli. Overexpression of Liprin-a3(1–

lacking
region or
Liprin-a3(457–737)
containing
mDia-binding regions, had no effect on
the actin cytoskeleton. These results sug-
gest that suppression of stress fiber forma-
tion by Liprin-a3(1–817)
requires not
only its binding site for mDia but also
functional domain(s) or another binding
site for other protein(s). Accordingly, we
postulated that Liprin-a would be acti-
vated by serum or other yet to be identi-
fied factors following which the functional
region is exposed and available to bind
mDia or other proteins. As we described
above, although Liprin-a preferably binds
to an open, active form of mDia, it cannot
bind to mDia in complex with the GTP-
bound active form of RhoA. This means
that Liprin-a binds to an open form of
mDia after GTP-RhoA dissociates from it.
This working model raises new questions:
when does active-Rho dissociate from
mDia, and how is dissociation of Rho
from GBD regulated? Recently, Cho and
coworkers reported that Xenopus Kazrin
to p190B RhoGAP
(xKazrinA) binds
directly.41 They
also
that
xKazrinA depletion significantly increases
RhoA activity, and induces actin cyto-
skeleton reorganization. As KazrinA and
KazrinE share the N-terminal coiled-coil

domain, Liprin-a would also likely share
this sequence. Hence, RhoGAP will be
one of
interaction
with Liprin-a, and subsequently regulate
Rho activity and Rho-mDia-interaction,
together with Liprin-a. If the N-terminal
region of Liprin-a potentially associates
with RhoGAP, we would propose the
following hypothesis which would answer
the questions described above. (1) Liprin-
a binds to RhoGAP, and then RhoGAP
accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of
Rho and inactivates active Rho in complex
with mDia. (2) GDP-bound inactive Rho
dissociates
that,
Liprin-a binds to mDia and dissociates it
from the plasma membrane. To further
analyze how the Rho-mDia signaling is
regulated in cells, examination of these
hypotheses will be necessary.

both Liprin-a homolog Dliprin-a and
LAR homolog Dlar localize presynaptically
at the NMJ. Dliprin-a mutants display
significant reduction in the number of
synaptic boutons, an increase in the length
of active zones, and a reduction in syn-
