Abstract
Research at the interface of psychology, neuroscience, molecular biology, and genetics, focusing on
the amygdala, has begun to reveal a rule book for emotional reactions. Variations in intrinsic and
extrinsic factors tweak the sensitivity of the amygdala, giving rise to differences in behavior between
individuals. At their most extreme, these variations may generate psychological disorders, and even
our current rudimentary understanding of this brain region suggests novel strategies for the
treatment of such disorders.

In this report, we provide an overview of the innovative
approaches and subsequent findings that have contrib-
uted to the discovery of specific factors that elucidate
how a relatively small portion of our brain called
“the amygdala” can dictate a significant number of the
behaviors that make up our emotional
lives. The
amygdala is a deep-brain structure that is uniquely
positioned to filter the constant barrage of input from
our external and internal worlds. It is the sensitivity of
this structure that dictates how the rest of the brain will
convert
those signals into adaptive behavioral and
physiological responses. Fundamentally, the amygdala
is critical to detecting and initiating the learning that
allows us to use environmental events to predict
potential threats. Whether it is a rat in a cage learning
that the tone it hears heralds a mild electric shock, or a
human realizing that someone is coming up behind
them because the person in front of them just widened
their eyes, it is the amygdala that calls the “rest of the
brain” into action so its smarter “parent” can decide what
to do (or not to do) next. Abnormal variations in
amygdala reactivity can lead to exaggerated reactions to
both intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (environmental)
signals,
leading to the disorders we experience as
depression and anxiety. The past ten years have borne
witness to remarkable progress in our understanding of

the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that modulate the
responsiveness of
the amygdala and its effects on
behavior and physiology. These advances offer the
beginnings of an understanding that addresses why
different individuals respond to adversity and challenge
in ways that range from submission to resilience.
Critically, these studies have uncovered novel neurobio-
logical targets for the treatment and even prevention of
psychopathological states.

Intrinsic factors
Three complimentary strategies have proven particularly
useful in identifying specific intrinsic factors that help
shape the responsiveness of the human amygdala [1].
Each of these three approaches is based on the ability to
accurately measure inter-individual differences in amyg-
dala function through blood oxygen level-dependent
functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI). In
the first strategy, commonly referred to as pharmacologic
fMRI, a drug that is a specific antagonist or agonist of a
targeted neuromodulatory system is administered to
subjects either shortly before or during BOLD fMRI. The
effects of
the drug on brain function are typically
compared to the effects of a placebo. Ideally, a double-
blinded design is employed so that neither the partici-
pants nor the investigators are aware which treatment is

being administered until all data have been collected.
Any differences in brain function between the drug and
placebo groups reflect a specific role in the brain circuitry
for the neuromodulatory system under investigation.
Such pharmacologic fMRI research has demonstrated
that several neuromodulatory systems, including dopa-
mine [2,3], serotonin [4,5], norepinephrine [6,7], GABA
[8], endocannabinoids [9], and steroid hormones
[10-12], affect the responsiveness of the human amyg-
dala. Although pharmacologic fMRI studies like those
noted above are useful for identifying specific systems
that modulate the human amygdala, they do not identify
inter-individual differences in the intrinsic functioning of
these systems and the resulting variability in the
responsiveness of the amygdala.

The second strategy addresses these shortcomings by
combining BOLD fMRI with neuroreceptor positron
emission tomography (PET). A significant number of
molecules involved in neuromodulatory signaling
cascades such as biosynthesis, release, reuptake, and
cell-signaling can be assayed in vivo using PET ligands.
By combining these PET-derived measures of brain
chemistry with BOLD fMRI data in the same participants,
intrinsic regional
levels of specific neuromodulatory
targets can be systematically related to brain function.
Already, such multimodal PET/fMRI studies have identi-
fied predictive links between inter-individual differences
in amygdala responsiveness and endogenous variability
in the serotonin [13-15] and dopamine [16,17] systems.
These effects are not only consistent with those observed
in pharmacologic fMRI studies but also serve to establish
how naturally occurring variability in these neuromo-
dulatory systems shapes amygdala functioning.

The third complimentary research strategy,
imaging
genetics, seeks to establish connections between com-
mon genetic polymorphisms, variability in neuromodu-
latory systems and inter-individual differences in brain
function. Thousands and possibly millions of common
polymorphisms (i.e., those variations in a gene that are
present in more than 1% of the population) exist across
the entire human genome. By affecting the pathways
between genes and their protein products, these poly-
morphisms can cause significant variability in the
functioning of neuromodulatory systems between indi-
viduals. Combining information on these common
functional genetic polymorphisms with BOLD fMRI
data from the same group of participants, we can map
the variability in neuromodulatory function associated
with the polymorphisms onto differences in brain
function between individuals. Many imaging genetic
findings of amydala function are consistent with patterns
reported in pharmacologic fMRI and multimodal

PET/fMRI studies. This includes confirmation of the
role of serotonin [18,19], dopamine [20-22], norepi-
nephrine [23], endocannabinoids [24], and steroid
hormones [25,26]. However, imaging genetics research
has also broken new ground in identifying specific
intrinsic factors that shape variability in amygdala
responsiveness in the absence of a priori pharmacologic
fMRI or multimodal PET/fMRI findings [27-29]. Unlike
the first two research strategies, which are limited by the
number of available drugs or ligands, respectively,
imaging genetics offers the potential to explore the
impact of any factor whose function may be affected by
common variation in its genetic code. Thus, imaging
genetics holds unique promise in identifying a broad
intrinsic factors that contribute to inter-
array of
individual differences in the responsiveness of
the
human amygdala.

Regardless of the specific strategy, the intrinsic factors
identified through the above research are largely
consistent with the identified roles of the amygdala,
the target neuromodulatory systems, and the genetic
polymorphisms that have been implicated in the
expression of normal emotional behavior as well as
psychopathology (particularly mood and anxiety dis-
orders). Moreover, these intrinsic factors, which mod-
ulate amygdala responsiveness, may be useful predictive
markers of relative risk for psychopathology. Even more
intriguingly, they suggest specific mechanisms for the
development of individually tailored treatment and,
ultimately, prevention strategies for psychopathology.

Extrinsic factors
Numerous studies have shown that increased amygdala
responsiveness is critical to acquiring a learned state of
fear during aversive conditioning [30]. During these
learned states, the amygdala mediates common adaptive
responses that allow the animal to learn best—examples
of these responses are autonomic responses such as heart
rate and respiration as well as somatomotor (movement-
related) responses such as freezing [31-34]. Critically, the
amygdala’s role in mediating these behaviors is particu-
larly important during learning when the outcome
predicted by a particular stimulus is uncertain, be it (a)
early in training, (b) when a particular contingency has
changed, or (c) when a cue can lead to more than one
outcome [33]. The key to elucidating the role of the
amygdala during learning is to devise tasks that set aside
a strong fear state that can overshadow the direct study of
the amygdala. For example, while early studies aimed to
present the human amygdala with stimuli that would
produce strong emotional state changes, recent studies
have opted to present more “emotionally subtle” stimuli
to assess the amygdala’s role in learning.

Photographs of facial expressions are often used as
stimuli in this context because we can glean information
about someone’s internal emotional state, their inten-
tions, and their reaction to events in our immediate
environment from their expressions. Facial expressions
of emotion have predicted important events for us in the
past, and we can use these previous experiences to
respond appropriately to expressions as we perceive
them.
facial expressions are naturally
In this way,
conditioned stimuli.

If the amygdala is constantly monitoring something as
subtle as changes in facial expression then it is playing a
fundamental
role in modulating our moment-to-
moment vigilance and learning [33]. The implications
this perspective has for amygdala dysfunction are there-
fore enormous. Aberration in this system would lead to
very basic interpersonal dysfunction that could lie at the
heart of a host of psychological disorders. Indeed, facial
expressions have been used as stimuli
to identify
abnormal amygdala responses in many disorders
[35,36] and, more importantly, have been used to
predict treatment outcomes in specific disorders includ-
ing generalized anxiety disorder [37,38].

Recent advances
Some useful research concerning amygdala reactions to
extrinsic events has addressed its role in processing
explicit versus implicit emotional events. That is, those
events and responses that we are consciously aware of,
and those that we are not. Being aware of your emotional
response to a particular environmental stimulus is clearly
beneficial. For example, knowing that your ex-wife
causes your blood to boil is a good thing to remind
yourself of before heading to an extended family
function. However, we are not always aware of the
emotional “triggers” that set us off, for example, some-
times we are in the middle of a social situation and look
down and realize that we are sweating. Numerous
studies have now examined whether the amygdala is
sensitive to these environmental events that escape our
awareness. Much like the field of human memory, the
study of human emotion is beginning to elucidate the
importance of
implicit versus explicit processing of
emotional information.

The early human neuroimaging work addressing implicit
emotion used a technique called backward masking to
present fearful facial expressions in a way that increased
amygdala activity without the participant being con-
sciously aware of their presence [39,40], a technique
derived from the seminal psychophysiological studies of
Arne Öhman [41,42]. Perceptual illusions other than
backward masking, such as binocular rivalry and

continuous flash suppression, have also been used to
demonstrate similar implicit effects [43,44]. However,
contrived experimental manipulations are not the only
way such effects can be shown. It is probably more
compelling to show such effects when subjects could
have been aware of the trigger. Demos and colleagues
[45] presented subjects with female faces and then told
them that a single facial feature had been manipulated.
Though none of the subjects were able to state what the
change was,
their amygdala did by discriminating
between faces with large compared to small pupils.
Since stimulation of
the amygdala produces pupil
dilation, this is an example of the amygdala showing
sensitivity to an emotional response in others that it
controls in one’s self.

In another example, Mujica-Parodi and colleagues [46]
presented their subjects with sweat samples from
individuals who had either just completed their first
sky dive or exercised on a treadmill. The subjects could
not possibly have known which of the samples were
from people experiencing their first sky dive, but their
amygdala knew, showing a larger response to the
samples derived from first-time sky divers. Therefore, if
another person in my immediate environment is in an
excitable state, even if I don’t know the reason myself,
perhaps I will have some sense for that and react
accordingly.

faces, all

Todorov and colleagues [47,48] provide one of our
favorite examples of the utility of separating amygdala
responses into “things I can explicitly tell you about”
from “those that I cannot.” Subjects were presented with
many pictures of
intended to have no
discernable expression (i.e., neutral). The subjects were
asked to tell the experimenters how trustworthy they
thought each face was based on a gut reaction. As
expected, each subject thought some of the faces were
more trustworthy-looking, some were in the middle, and
some were less trustworthy-looking. Not surprisingly,
their amygdala responses to these faces also matched
their verbal assessments. From a large number of varied
ratings, the researchers computed a mean trustworthi-
ness score for each face. Fascinatingly, although the test
group’s amygdala responses correlated with their own
subjective verbal ratings of the faces, their amygdala
responses showed an even stronger relationship with the
consensus ratings for each face! The implications of this
finding are many, but most importantly it means that
“there are rules”—implicit rules about certain facial
features that guide our amygdala reactions and, in turn,
our behavior. Although we can modulate these reactions
once we become aware of them, we have less control over
their initiation.

Future directions
These examples of implicit emotional processing are
sometimes passed off as “cute” novelties. But we suggest
that they will be critical to fully understanding our
emotional lives and their aberrations in psychopathology.
Depression and anxiety are not explicit emotional
behaviors—they are, at their core, exaggerated implicit
emotional
reactions that have not been properly
regulated. Identification of the genetic signatures that
predict
these exaggerated reactions, as well as the
compromised prefrontal function that yields to these
exaggerations, will clarify the predisposition of particu-
lar individuals to psychopathology. Combining infor-
mation gleaned from examining implicit and explicit
emotional function with measurement of the genetic
markers that help shape each individual’s “trigger”
point,
future direction that will yield
is one clear
benefits for the field.
