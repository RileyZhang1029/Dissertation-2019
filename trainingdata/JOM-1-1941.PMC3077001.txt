Open access to oral microbiology

It is a great pleasure in this inaugural Editorial to

present a new partnership for scientific publication in
the field of oral microbiology. With the recent
development of a wide array of new techniques, particu-
larly in molecular biology,
this area has developed
tremendously over the last few years. It has also become
increasingly clear that the microflora of the oral cavity is
an equally important object of investigation as microflora
found in the rest of the body. Indeed, there is growing
evidence that points to the oral cavity as a significant site
for prevention of major diseases in humans.

Partners
Journal of Oral Microbiology (JOM) is a new interna-
tional, peer-reviewed Open Access (OA) journal pub-
lished by Co-Action Publishing (www.co-action.net). Co-
Action Publishing is a relatively new OA publisher
located in Scandinavia and one of only a handful of
publishing houses worldwide offering a true OA publish-
ing model for scholarly journals. To the best of our
knowledge, JOM will be the first journal in the field of
oral microbiology published under to the OA model. In
close collaboration with Co-Action Publishing, I myself,
the Advisory Board and the Editorial Board members
will work hard to ensure a great impact for the journal in
the years to come and develop it into a major source of
information in the broad and expanding field of oral
microbiology.

All articles published in JOM will be freely accessible
online immediately after they have been accepted for
publication, and can be read, downloaded,
stored,
printed, and copied without restrictions by anybody
with a computer and access to the internet. Furthermore,
the OA model offers additional multimedia benefits such
as videos, audios, links to full datasets, unlimited colour
budgets and interactive features, all of which the printed
medium cannot provide. Co-Action Publishing will en-
sure that the best web technology supports the editorial
team of JOM as well as the contributing authors, and
thereby enhance the scholarly content of the journal.

Scope
Some of the most common infectious diseases of the
mouth, for instance tooth caries and periodontitis, are
distributed worldwide. Health authorities spend huge
sums of money annually to treat these diseases, which
cause much pain and discomfort globally. New techni-
ques in the field of microbiology have made it possible for

us to understand why and how the diseases develop;
however, we still need to extend our knowledge and
understanding of both aetiology, diagnosis and treatment
to be able to combat them. It is true that a great deal has
already been achieved to prevent oral infections, but they
are by no means eradicated. In fact, despite all our efforts
they continue to thrive in all societies causing great harm.
JOM welcomes papers describing current knowledge
on aetiologic agents as well as the practical implementa-
tion of this knowledge. Papers providing new knowledge
and novel concepts, particularly on pathogenesis and
virulence, and papers dealing with hostparasite interac-
tions are also welcome. Additionally, we encourage
researchers worldwide to submit papers suggesting im-
proved strategies for treatment and prevention and new
strategies where none exist. Finally, we welcome papers
that address the global agenda of oral infectious diseases.

Oral infections aetiologic agents

Oral diseases have traditionally been related to a limited
number of aetiologic agents. The reason for this is that
culture has been used to demonstrate these agents.
However, only 50% of the 700 different bacteria in the
mouth are detected by culture. JOM looks to publish
papers demonstrating the full breadth of the oral micro-
flora, and particularly papers indicating the aetiologic
role of uncultivable organisms and their microbial/host
interactions. Bacteria, viruses, yeasts or protozoa are in
focus.

Oral infections pathogenesis

JOM encourages the submission of papers on pathogen-
esis, including virulence factors, for the development of
caries, periodontitis
(marginal/apical) and mucositis.
Basic, translational and clinical microbiological studies
are welcome.

Oral infections systemic diseases

Papers describing research and innovative research meth-
ods to understand the relationship between oral diseases
and systemic diseases are particularly welcome.

Oral infections ecology/environmental

microbiology
Papers dealing with the importance of ecology/environ-
mental microbiology in the initiation and progression of
oral infection are also welcome.

Editorial

Oral infections treatment

Papers on new treatment strategies for oral infectious
diseases are encouraged, for instance, use of probiotics
and biotechnology. JOM welcomes papers on the devel-
opment and prevention of antibacterial resistance as well
as on natural antimicrobials in the mouth.

Oral infections diagnostics

Studies on the development and application of new
methods for diagnosis of oral infections are welcome,
particularly those dealing with the use of molecular
methods and genetics. Papers on the diagnostic use of
oral fluids such as saliva and gingival fluid are also
welcome.

Oral infections epidemiology

The burden of oral infections is highest in poor countries.
JOM welcomes epidemiological studies of oral infectious
diseases especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Oral microbiologytaxonomy/systematics

Taxonomy/systematics is the basis for good communica-
tion between microbiologists. JOM welcomes papers in
this field.

What we offer
JOM welcomes original articles, review articles, debate
articles as well as short communications. Excellent study
design articles on, for instance, population research may
precede publication of the results. All manuscripts will be
peer reviewed and edited to the highest standards.

JOM is committed to building research capacity
globally by offering mentorship to less-experienced
researchers in order to help promote manuscripts with
great potential yet lacking in either scientific or formal
stringency. A group of multidisciplinary and experienced
researchers in oral microbiology have committed them-
selves to serve as mentors and they will be in close
dialogue with the authors until the paper is up to
standards. The Mentor will not be named among the
co-authors but mentioned in the published paper as
‘Contributing Editor’.

Publication of an article in JOM involves a relatively
modest cost. However, to emphasise our commitment to
extend an arena for publication in which developing
settings can publish their research results, the publication
fee may be waived for authors from institutions or
projects unable to pay.

Open Access serves the interests of all readers: authors,
teachers, students, libraries, universities, funding agen-
cies, governments and citizens. It increases the visibility of
individual authors’ work. Key resources are equally
accessible to rich and poor. The mission of most
universities
to disseminate and share knowledge is
facilitated, and funders (including governments) are given
return on investment. It is high time to make research
results in the field of oral microbiology freely available!
