Abstract
While there is a clear connection between apoptosis and autophagy, the mechanisms that regulate
the interaction have been difficult to identify. The initial clue to the link was the observation that Bcl-2
was located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it could prevent some forms of apoptosis
and also bind to the autophagy regulatory protein Beclin-1. However, both of these enigmatic
observations have been united with the discovery of the nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1
(NAF-1) protein. As an ER-localized protein that enhances the interaction of Bcl-2 and Beclin-1 and
that also binds to the pro-apoptotic protein Bik, NAF-1 is perfectly placed to be a central regulator of
the switch between autophagy and apoptosis.

Introduction and context
Over the past several years, extensive work has been done
to elucidate the process whereby members of the Bcl-2
protein family at the mitochondrial outer membrane
regulate the decision phase that commits cells to apoptosis.
The current consensus is that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
family members Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) and Bak
(Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer) exist as inactive
monomers. After exposure of the cell to an apoptotic sti-
mulus, these proteins change their conformation in the
mitochondrial outer membrane, form oligomers, and per-
meabilize the membrane, allowing the contents of the
inter-membrane space to escape. The released proteins
initiate the downstream caspase cascade that executes
apoptosis. The two other subclasses of the Bcl-2 family (the
Bcl-2 homology region 3 (BH3)-only proteins and the anti-
apoptotic members) have distinct roles in this process:
BH3-only proteins activate Bax, Bak, or both, whereas
the anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 (B-cell lymp-
homa 2), Bcl-XL (B-cell lymphoma-extra large), and Mcl-1
(induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein)
inhibit the BH3-only proteins as well as Bax and Bak.

However, all three subclasses of the Bcl-2 family are also
found at the ER. The critical event that initiates apoptosis

at the ER is more contentious than the action of the
mitochondrial outer membrane. This is complicated by
observations suggesting that Bcl-2 family proteins regulate
both caspase-dependent apoptosis and autophagy (an
independent cell death/survival pathway initiated at the
ER). The laboratory run by Gordon Shore at McGill
University, Montreal, has been a leader in investigating the
consequences of the Bcl-2 family localization to the ER.
They have previously shown that an ER-specific BH3-only
family member, Bik, can bind to Bcl-2 located at the ER
and cause apoptosis [1]. They also identified a Bcl-2-
associated protein that links Bcl-2 to autophagy. Signifi-
cantly, a homozygous mutation in this protein that
disrupts interaction with Bcl-2 was recently identified in
three pedigrees with Wolfram syndrome, a severe neuro-
degenerative disorder [2].

Major recent advances
By using a form of Bcl-2 specifically targeted to the ER
(Bcl2-cb5) [3],
the nutrient-deprivation autophagy
factor-1 (NAF-1) protein was demonstrated to be
required for Bcl-2 to antagonize the autophagy regulatory
protein Beclin-1 [4]. Crosslinking and subsequent mass
spectrometry were used to identify proteins that both
bound to Bcl2-cb5 and were displaced by Bik. The most

abundant protein found in this search was a previously
recognized small (15 kD) type 1 transmembrane protein
containing a cytosolic iron-sulfur binding cluster desig-
nated NAF-1 [4]. When analyzed by immunofluores-
cence, NAF-1 seems to be localized to the ER. The data
obtained using a variety of approaches including binding
to glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and immu-
noprecipitation of transfected cells, as well as the original
crosslinking experiments, make it highly likely that the
interaction between NAF-1 and Bcl-2 at the ER is direct,
although this has yet to be formally proven. Importantly,
decreasing NAF-1 expression by silencing RNA did not
affect apoptosis initiated by Bik binding to Bcl-2. NAF-1
knockdown does enhance both starvation-induced auto-
phagy as well as Bik-dependent autophagy, mediated by
the displacement of Beclin-1 binding to Bcl-2. Beclin-1 is
an authentic BH3-only binding protein [5] that, when
released from Bcl-2, participates in a multi-component
complex that initiates the formation of autophagosome
formation at the ER [6,7].

In co-immunoprecipitation assays, NAF-1 was also shown
to be present in a complex containing Bcl-2 and the
inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R). This interaction may
be functionally relevant because the effect of Bcl-2 binding
to IP3R on intraluminal calcium stores, a mechanism
elegantly demonstrated by Clark Distelhorst’s group [8], is
also inhibited by knocking down NAF-1 expression.

Future directions
These important findings shed light on the regulation
of both apoptosis and autophagy at the ER by Bcl-2.
Functionally, the interaction between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 is
enhanced by NAF-1, indeed, the data from Chang et al. [4]
strongly suggest that NAF-1 binds directly to Bcl-2. It is
unclear whether or not NAF-1 also binds directly
to Beclin-1 and therefore acts as an adaptor protein for
the Bcl-2–Beclin-1 interaction, or alternatively whether
NAF-1 binding alters the conformation of the Bcl-2 BH3
binding region such that it binds to Beclin-1 more tightly.
There is already support for the theory that binding of
BH3-only proteins to Bcl-2 at the ER alters Bcl-2 confor-
mation and function [9]. If proven to be true, this would
be the first instance where a non-BH3-only protein would
be shown to have a similar effect to Bid (BH3 interacting
domain death agonist) or Bim (Bcl-2-like protein 11).
This would mean that NAF-1 would function as a specific
allosteric regulator, as it does not seem to alter the binding
of Bcl-2 to whichever BH3-only protein is displaced by Bik
to initiate apoptosis.

ER and the potential involvement of NAF-1 in regulating
autophagy via IP3R. The functional importance of this
interaction is highlighted by the recent observation that
baseline activity of IP3R is required to mediate low-level
calcium release from the ER, where it is taken up by the
mitochondrial calcium uniporter [10]. In this organelle, it
is required to turn on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity,
mediating a switch from glycolysis to the Krebs acid cycle
thereby enhancing oxidative phosphorylation. When this
process is interrupted at any of the steps between calcium
release and ATP generation, energy deprivation is sensed
and macro-autophagy is initiated in an mTOR (mamma-
lian target of rapamycin)-independent fashion. Thus, by
facilitating the binding of Bcl-2 to both Beclin and IP3R,
NAF-1 may mediate the control of two separate arms of
autophagic cell death or survival.

Therefore, NAF-1 may act as a switch between autophagy
and apoptosis at the ER. It is intriguing to note that the
other mutated gene associated with Wolfram’s syndrome
also encodes a transmembrane ER protein that regulates
calcium homeostasis, suggesting that this is an impor-
tant pathway for neuronal survival [11]. Investigating
how NAF-1 interaction with Bcl-2 modulates binding
of partners through different binding domains will be
essential to understanding how this switch is regulated. It
will also be important to determine whether all these
proteins are present in the same complex or whether
some interactions are mutually exclusive. Finally, it will
be interesting to find out whether regulation is achieved
by different complexes (if they exist) competing with
each other for limiting factors.
