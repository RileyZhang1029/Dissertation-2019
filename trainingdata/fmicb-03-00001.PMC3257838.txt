The study of antibiotic resistance has been 
historically  concentrated  on  the  analysis 
of  bacterial  pathogens  and  on  the  conse-
quences of acquiring resistance for human 
health.  The  development  of  antibiotic 
resistance  is  of  course  extremely  relevant 
from the clinical point of view, because it 
can  compromise  the  treatment  of  infec-
tious  diseases  as  well  as  other  advanced 
therapeutic procedures as transplantation 
or anticancer therapy that involve immu-
nosuppression and thus require robust anti-
infective preventive therapies. Nevertheless, 
the studies on antibiotic resistance should 
not be confined to clinical-associated eco-
systems.  It  was  evident  soon  after  intro-
ducing antibiotics for human therapy, that 
bacteria  were  able  to  develop  resistance, 
not  just  as  the  consequence  of  mutations 
in the targets of antibiotics, but by acquir-
ing genes conferring resistance to antimi-
crobials (Abraham and Chain, 1940). Since 
those genes were not present before in the 
human bacterial pathogens, the only suit-
able source for them was the environmen-
tal microbiota, and indeed the presence of 
R-factors (resistance plasmids) in pristine 
environments without any record of contact 
with antibiotics was described in the first 
studies of antibiotic resistance in the field 
(Gardner et al., 1969).

Given that the origin of antibiotic resist-
ance  is  the  environmental  microbiota,  it 
would  be  necessary  to  study  resistance  in 
natural,  non-clinical  habitats  in  order  to 
fully understand the cycle of acquisition of 
resistance by human pathogens. However, 
until recently the studies on antibiotic resist-
ance in natural ecosystems have been frag-
mentary. The availability of metagenomic 
tools as well as high-throughput sequencing 
techniques is allowing describing in depth 
the presence of resistance genes in different 
ecosystems.  Indeed,  the  use  of  functional 
genomic and metagenomic techniques has 
served  to  show  that  natural  ecosystems, 

including not just soils but human gut as 
well,  contain  a  large  number  of  elements 
that, upon transfer to a new host, can con-
fer resistance to any type of antimicrobial 
(D’Costa et al., 2006; Sommer et al., 2009). 
These include natural antibiotics, which are 
produced by the environmental microbiota, 
and synthetic antimicrobials, as quinolones.
One  important  question  from  an  evo-
lutionary point of view is the function of 
these resistance genes in their natural envi-
ronmental hosts (Davies and Davies, 2010). 
Whereas for naturally produced antibiotics 
a protective role for resistance genes in the 
producers  organisms  (or  those  coexisting 
with producers Laskaris et al., 2010) might 
be foreseen (Benveniste and Davies, 1973), 
this  explanation  is  not  suitable  for  syn-
thetic antibiotics as quinolones. Indeed, it 
has  been  described  that  the  origin  of  the 
quinolone  resistance  gene  QnrA,  which 
is now widespread in plasmids present in 
human  pathogens  is  the  environmental 
non-antibiotic  producer  Shewanella  algae 
(Poirel et al., 2005). This means that a gene 
that confers resistance in a human patho-
gen does not necessary play the same role 
in its original host (Martinez et al., 2009a). 
The finding that several proteins, involved 
in basic processes of the bacterial physiol-
ogy,  contribute  to  intrinsic  resistance  to 
antibiotics  (Fajardo  et  al.,  2008;  Laskaris 
et  al.,  2010;  Linares  et  al.,  2010),  further 
supports the concept that resistance genes, 
acquired through horizontal gene transfer 
by human pathogens, might have evolved 
in their original host to play a different role 
than resisting the activity of antimicrobials 
in natural ecosystems.

We can thus distinguish two ages in the 
evolution of antibiotic resistance genes. For 
billions of years (until the use of antibiotics 
by humans), these genes have been usually 
chromosomally encoded and had evolved 
for  different  purposes.  Some  of  them,  as 
those found in antibiotic producers, likely 

evolved  for  detoxifying  the  original  host 
from  the  antibiotic  it  produces,  although 
a role in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic 
itself has been proposed as well for some of 
them (Benveniste and Davies, 1973; Doyle 
et  al.,  1991).  Others,  as  beta-lactamases 
might  be  involved  in  the  biosynthesis  of 
the cell wall (Jacobs et al., 1994; Massova 
and  Mobashery,  1998),  whereas  others  as 
multidrug  efflux  pumps  might  serve  for 
different  purposes  including  the  traffick-
ing  of  signaling  molecules,  detoxification 
of metabolic intermediates, or extrusion of 
plant-produced compounds among others 
(Martinez et al., 2009b). Like in the case of 
antibiotics, which do not necessarily have 
an inhibitory function at the concentrations 
in which they are present in natural ecosys-
tems (Linares et al., 2006; Yim et al., 2007; 
Fajardo and Martinez, 2008), the fact that 
a  plasmid-encoded  gene  produces  resist-
ance to antibiotics upon its expression in a 
new host, is not an unequivocal prove that 
it confers resistance as well in its original 
host. This reflection serves to show the rel-
evance of the second age in the evolution of 
antibiotic resistance determinants. Once a 
gene is introduced in a new host in which 
it lacks its original biochemical and genetic 
context,  its  function  is  limited  to  antibi-
otic resistance (Baquero et al., 2009). This 
change  of  function  without  changing  the 
sequence of the gene itself, has been named 
as exaptation (Gould and Vrba, 1982), and 
is the consequence of the strong selective 
pressure  exerted  by  antibiotics  in  the  last 
decades from the time they were introduced 
for therapy.

Two  important  aspects  are  emerging 
from the studies of natural resistome. First, 
the  environmental  microbiota  contains  a 
much  larger  number  of  resistance  genes 
than  those  seen  to  be  acquired  by  bacte-
rial  pathogens  (Wright,  2007;  Davies  and 
Davies, 2010). Furthermore, different eco-
systems contain different resistance genes,

Two ages in antibiotic resistance

which  means  that  we  are  still  far  away  to 
have a consistent estimation on the number 
of potential resistance genes present in nat-
ural ecosystems. Finally, the origin of most 
resistance genes currently found in transfer-
rable elements is still ignored, despite genes 
(and  genetic  structures)  belonging  to  the 
same families are regularly found in differ-
ent  ecosystems,  including  deep  terrestrial 
subsurface (Brown and Balkwill, 2009), ice 
(Miteva et al., 2004), and even the perma-
frost (D’Costa et al., 2011), which have not 
been in contact with human contaminants. 
Second, those genes present in mobile ele-
ments in human bacterial pathogens can be 
found nearly everywhere, including pristine 
ecosystems or wild animals not supposed 
to be in contact with antibiotics (Martinez, 
2009).  This  indicates  that  pollution  with 
antibiotic resistance genes is widely spread 
and that resistance genes can persist even in 
the absence of a positive selection pressure. 
The analysis of historical soil archives has 
shown  a  consistent  increase  on  the  pres-
ence  of  antibiotic  resistance  genes  since 
1940 (Knapp et al., 2010), which is a clear 
prove  of  the  contamination  by  antibiotic 
resistance  elements  of  natural  ecosystems 
and the resilience of those elements for their 
elimination.

In this situation, which type of studies 
are needed to analyze in depth the role that 
natural ecosystems may have on the devel-
opment  of  resistance  in  human  bacterial 
pathogens?  In  my  opinion,  these  studies 
have two faces (Martinez, 2008). One con-
sists  on  the  analysis  of  the  genes  already 
present  in  bacterial  pathogens.  In  other 
words,  we  will  study  mainly  contamina-
tion by antibiotic resistance determinants 
and how this contamination might increase 
the  risks  for  the  dissemination  of  those 
elements  (Martinez,  2009).  These  studies 
might serve to define reservoirs, elements 
for enrichment and dissemination of resist-
ance (as wild birds Simoes et al., 2010) or 
hotspots  for  the  transfer  of  resistance  as 
waste-water  treatment  plants  (Baquero 
et  al.,  2008).  For  instance,  a  recent  study 
has  shown  that  soil  composition  and  in 
particular  the  presence  of  heavy  metals 
might  enrich  for  the  presence  of  antibi-
otic resistance genes in natural ecosystems 
(Knapp  et  al.,  2011).  The  other  type  of 
studies consists on the analysis, using func-
tional assays, of novel resistance genes in 
different ecosystems (D’Costa et al., 2006, 

2011; Sommer et al., 2009). These studies 
are useful for defining novel mechanisms 
of resistance, but making risks assessments 
on  whether  those  novel  antibiotic  resist-
ance genes will be transferred to new hosts 
is likely unsuitable (Martinez et al., 2007). 
On the other hand tracking the source of 
currently known resistance gene has dem-
onstrated  to  be  a  very  difficult  task.  We 
have  to  be  extremely  careful  for  assign-
ing the origin of resistance determinants. 
Only when the genes are nearly identical 
(as QnrA) and the gene is present in several 
strains of the original host, with the same 
synteny and without any sign of a recent 
acquisition event, we can firmly establish 
this  host  being  the  origin.  The  report  of 
genes that are highly similar (even above 
90%)  to  antibiotic  resistance  genes  dem-
onstrate their belonging to the same phy-
logenetic group, not that one is the origin 
of the other. Does it mean that we will be 
unable of tracking the source of resistance 
genes and to propose from this information 
valuable strategies for reducing antibiotic 
resistance? I do not believe that. It has been 
already determined that QnrA was origi-
nated in S. algae (Poirel et al., 2005) and 
that  chromosomally  encoded  qnr  genes 
are mainly present in water-dwelling bac-
teria (Sanchez et al., 2008). This suggests 
that the source of transferrable quinolone 
resistance is the water microbiota and puts 
a  focus  on  the  effect  that  the  use  of  qui-
nolones in aquaculture might have had for 
the emergence and dissemination of these 
resistance elements (Cabello, 2006).

The  study  on  antibiotic  resistance  in 
natural  ecosystems  and  its  role  on  the 
maintenance  and  spread  of  clinically  rel-
evant resistance determinants is still in its 
infancy.  It  is  surprising  that  large  efforts 
have  been  used  to  study  the  risks  for  the 
dissemination of resistance that may have 
the release of genetic modified organisms 
containing resistance genes in their chro-
mosomes, whereas the study of the effect 
of  the  discharge  of  human  wastes,  which 
contain bacterial pathogens harboring the 
resistance  genes  that  have  demonstrated 
to  be  really  relevant,  in  the  elements  that 
are important for their dissemination has 
received few attention if any. Studies in this 
new field are needed in order to understand 
the mechanisms involved in the emergence, 
spread, maintenance, and evolution of anti-
biotic resistance.
