Salmonella enterica is an important enteric pathogen, and its various serovars cause both
systemic and intestinal diseases in humans and domestic animals. The emergence of
multidrug-resistant strains of Salmonella, leading to increased morbidity and mortality, has
further complicated its management. Hfq is an RNA chaperon that mediates the binding
of small RNAs to mRNA and assists in post-transcriptional gene regulation in bacteria.
Although Hfq is related to important phenotypes including virulence in Salmonella, its role
in the drug resistance of this organism is unknown.The aim of this study was to investigate
the role of Hfq in intrinsic drug resistance of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. hfq Mutant
was susceptible to acriﬂavine. Although there is a relationship between the production of
the AcrB multidrug efﬂux pump and Hfq in Escherichia coli, the deletion of the drug efﬂux
acrB did not impair the effect of hfq deletion on Salmonella susceptibility. In contrast, the
deletion of another drug efﬂux gene, smvA, impaired the effect of hfq deletion on acriﬂavine
susceptibility. These results indicate that Hfq regulates the intrinsic drug resistance, and it
may inﬂuence drug susceptibility by regulating SmvA in Salmonella.

INTRODUCTION
Salmonella causes a variety of diseases in humans, ranging from
gastroenteritis to bacteremia and typhoid fever (Scherer and
Miller, 2001). In the 1990s, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant
Salmonella enterica increased dramatically in the United Kingdom,
the United States, and Canada (Hosek et al., 1997; Threlfall et al.,
1997; Glynn et al., 1998; Ng et al., 1999). Many other countries
have also documented outbreaks associated with drug-resistant
Salmonella in poultry, beef, and pork (Davies et al., 1996; Cody
et al., 1999; Grein et al., 1999; Molbak et al., 1999; Villar et al.,
1999). Emerging resistance in Salmonella has been observed in
both humans and animals, and thus, this is a potentially serious
public health problem (Cloeckaert and Chaslus-Dancla, 2001; Pid-
dock, 2002). Drug resistance in bacteria is often associated with
multidrug efﬂux pumps that decrease cellular drug accumulation
(Nikaido, 1996; Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 2000).

The phenomenon of multidrug resistance is associated with the
ability of pumps to expel from cells multiple drugs with different
modes of action. Multidrug resistance is a serious problem in treat-
ment of human ailments caused by pathogenic bacteria, fungi, par-
asites, and cancer. Functional studies identiﬁed multidrug efﬂux
pumps classiﬁed in ﬁve families: ATP-binding cassette (ABC),
the major facilitator (MFS), resistance-nodulation-cell division
(RND), small multidrug resistance, and multidrug and toxic com-
pound extrusion families (Brown et al., 1999; Putman et al., 2000;
Paulsen et al., 2001). The sequencing of bacterial genomes enables
us to trace putative drug resistance genes (Paulsen et al., 1998,
2000). There are many putative and proven drug efﬂux pumps in
the Salmonella genome. We previously demonstrated that S. enter-
ica serovar Typhimurium has nine functional drug efﬂux pumps

(Nishino et al., 2006). In addition to these pumps, it has been
reported that SmvA is an important efﬂux pump for acriﬂavine
and related compounds (Villagra et al., 2008). Because many of
these multidrug efﬂux pumps have overlapping substrate spectra,
it is intriguing that bacteria, with their economically organized
genomes, harbor such large sets of multidrug efﬂux genes. The
key to understanding how bacteria utilize these multiple pumps
lies in the regulation of pump expression. Currently, available data
indicate that multidrug efﬂux pumps are often expressed under
precise and elaborate transcriptional control (Ahmed et al., 1994;
Lomovskaya et al., 1995; Brooun et al., 1999; Grkovic et al., 2002).
The Hfq protein is a conserved RNA chaperone protein ﬁrst
characterized as a host factor (HF-1) for phage Qβ RNA replica-
tion (Franze de Fernandez et al., 1968) and subsequently shown
to be widely distributed in the bacterial kingdom with mul-
tiple homologs in the annotated genomic database (Brennan
and Link, 2007). As a bacterial homolog of the eukaryotic and
archaeal Sm/LSm proteins, Hfq is known largely for its global
post-transcriptional regulation by binding AU-rich sequences of
target mRNA and facilitating pairing between sRNAs and mRNAs
(Moller et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002;Valentin-Hansen et al., 2004;
Waters and Storz, 2009). Most Hfq homologs are known to func-
tion as homohexamers with two independent RNA-binding motifs
(Brennan and Link, 2007), and hfq mutants exhibit pleiotropic
phenotypes (Tsui et al., 1994). In recent years, Hfq has been estab-
lished as an important virulence factor in bacterial pathogens
(Hansen and Kaper, 2009). Deletion of hfq has long been known
to impair the expression of σS (Brown and Elliott, 1996), a gen-
eral stress sigma factor essential for Salmonella virulence in mice
(Fang et al., 1992). hfq mutation was also revealed to attenuate

Role of Hfq in Salmonella drug resistance

the ability of Salmonella to invade epithelial cells, secrete virulence
factors, infect mice, and survive inside cultured macrophages (Sit-
tka et al., 2007). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Hfq controls
the expression of Salmonella genes in several horizontally acquired
pathogenicity islands (SPI-1, -2, -4, -5), two sigma factor regulons,
and the ﬂagellar gene cascade (Sittka et al., 2008). However, the
role Hfq in the drug resistance of Salmonella is unknown.

In this study, we demonstrate that Hfq affects drug suscepti-
bilities in Salmonella. In addition, we reveal that SmvA and not
the AcrB drug efﬂux system contributes to the Hfq-mediated
drug resistance of Salmonella, whereas it has been reported
that AcrB contributes to the Hfq-mediated drug resistance of
Escherichia coli. Our data suggest that Hfq plays an important
role in controlling drug susceptibility against acriﬂavine and
that the SmvA efﬂux pump is involved in this susceptibility in
Salmonella.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
BACTERIAL STRAINS, PLASMIDS, AND GROWTH CONDITIONS
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in
Table 1. The strains of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium used in
this study were derived from the wild-type strain ATCC 14028s
(Fields et al., 1986). Bacterial strains were grown at 37˚C in
Lysogeny Broth (LB). Ampicillin was added to the growth medium
at a ﬁnal concentration of 100 μg/ml for plasmid maintenance.

CONSTRUCTION OF GENE DELETION MUTANTS
The ΔacrB (NKS148) and ΔtolC (NKS174) mutants were con-
structed as described previously (Horiyama et al., 2010). To
construct Δhfq and ΔsmvA mutants, gene disruption was per-
formed as described by Datsenko and Wanner (2000). The
following oligonucleotide primers were used for the construc-
tion of the mutants: hfq-P1 (GAAAGGTTCAAAGTACAAATAAG-
CATATAAGGAAAAGAGAGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC); hfq-
P2 (ATTATCCGACGCCCCCGACATGGATAAACAGCGCGTGA
ACCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG); smvA-P1 (CTGGACAAGCG

The chloramphenicol resistance gene cat, ﬂanked by Flp recog-
nition sites, was ampliﬁed by PCR using the primers listed above.
The resulting PCR products were used to transform the recipi-
ent ATCC 14028s strain that harbors the plasmid pKD46, which
expresses Red recombinase. The chromosomal structure of the
mutated loci was veriﬁed by PCR. cat was eliminated using the
plasmid pCP20, as described previously (Datsenko and Wanner,
2000). To construct the ΔacrBΔhfq, ΔtolCΔhfq, and ΔsmvAΔhfq
double mutants, the deletions were transferred to strains by P22
transduction as described by Davis et al. (1980).

PLASMID CONSTRUCTION
smvA was ampliﬁed from ATCC 14028s genomic DNA by using
the primers GCGCATGCCATTCGTTCAACTTACCGAGG and
GCGTCGACGGAAATGGACTCCCCCTGCC, which introduced
SphI and SalI sites (underlined in the primer sequences above).
The fragment was cleaved with SphI and SalI and then cloned into
the corresponding sites of pBR322, resulting in psmvA (Table 1).

DETERMINATION OF THE MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION OF
TOXIC COMPOUNDS
The antibacterial activities of various agents were determined on
LB agar (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) plates con-
taining nalidixic acid, acriﬂavine, rhodamine 6G, benzalkonium,
oxacillin, cefamandole, sodium dodecyl sulfate, or norﬂoxacin
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at various concentrations as indicated
in Table 2. Agar plates were made by the twofold agar dilu-
tion technique, as described previously (Horiyama et al., 2010).
To determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), bac-
teria were grown in LB broth at 37˚C overnight, diluted into
the same medium, and then tested at a ﬁnal inoculum size of
1× 105 cfu/μl using a multipoint inoculator (Sakuma Seisakusyo,
Tokyo, Japan) after incubation at 37˚C for 20 h. The MIC was the
lowest concentration of a compound that inhibited cell growth.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Hfq AFFECTS THE INTRINSIC DRUG SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SALMONELLA
To investigate the role of Hfq in drug susceptibilities, hfq was
deleted from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC
14028s, as described in the Section “Materials and Methods.” Δhfq
mutant was more sensitive to acriﬂavine (64-fold) than the wild-
type strain (Table 2). The MICs of nalidixic acid, rhodamine
6G, benzalkonium, oxacillin, cefamandole, sodium dodecyl sul-
fate, and norﬂoxacin were the same for Δhfq mutant as those
for the wild-type strain. These data indicate that Hfq affects the
intrinsic acriﬂavine resistance of Salmonella.

AcrB IS NOT INVOLVED IN Hfq-MEDIATED DRUG SUSCEPTIBILITY OF
SALMONELLA
In E. coli, it has been demonstrated that the AcrB multidrug efﬂux
pump is involved in Hfq-mediated multidrug resistance (Yamada
et al., 2010). To investigate whether AcrB in Salmonella is also
involved in Hfq-mediated drug susceptibility of this organism,
we measured MICs of several toxic compounds against ΔacrB

mutant (Table 2). The ΔacrB mutant was sensitive to nalidixic acid
(fourfold), acriﬂavine (64-fold), rhodamine 6G (512-fold), benza-
lkonium (16-fold), oxacillin (512-fold), cefamandole (fourfold),
sodium dodecyl sulfate (>256-fold), and norﬂoxacin (eightfold).
Although ΔacrB mutant was as sensitive to acriﬂavine as Δhfq
mutant, the drug susceptibility pattern for other compounds was
very different among these mutants. ΔacrBΔhfq double mutant
was more sensitive to acriﬂavine (fourfold) than ΔacrB mutant,
indicating that the deletion of acrB did not impair the effect of
hfq deletion on Salmonella susceptibility. Based on these data, it
was suggested that factors other than AcrB may be involved in the
Hfq-mediated drug susceptibility of Salmonella because the drug
susceptibility pattern of ΔacrB was very different from that of
Δhfq, and the deletion of hfq from ΔacrB mutant made this strain
more sensitive to acriﬂavine.

TolC IS NOT INVOLVED IN THE Hfq-MEDIATED DRUG SUSCEPTIBILITY
OF SALMONELLA
TolC is a major outer membrane channel, and a variety of inner
membrane and accessory protein interact with TolC to expel struc-
turally diverse molecules. We previously identiﬁed that seven drug
efﬂux systems,AcrAB,AcrD,AcrEF, MdsAB, MdtABC, EmrAB, and
MacAB, in Salmonella that require TolC to function (Horiyama
et al., 2010). To investigate whether TolC-dependent type drug
efﬂux systems are involved in Hfq-mediated drug susceptibil-
ity, we measured MICs of compounds against ΔtolC mutant
(Table 2). ΔtolC mutant was sensitive to nalidixic acid (eightfold),
acriﬂavine (128-fold), rhodamine 6G (512-fold), benzalkonium
(16-fold), oxacillin (2048-fold), cefamandole (fourfold), sodium
dodecyl sulfate (>1024-fold), and norﬂoxacin (eightfold). The
susceptibilities of ΔtolC mutant to oxacillin and sodium dode-
cyl sulfate were higher than those of the ΔacrB mutant probably
because TolC-dependent type efﬂux systems other than AcrB are
involved in the efﬂux of these compounds. The deletion of hfq
from ΔtolC mutant made this strain more sensitive to acriﬂavine
(fourfold), meaning that the TolC-dependent type drug efﬂux

systems are not involved in the Hfq-mediated drug susceptibility
of Salmonella.

INVOLVEMENT OF SmvA EFFLUX PUMP IN THE Hfq-MEDIATED
ACRIFLAVINE SUSCEPTIBILITY
Among the tested compounds, Δhfq mutant was speciﬁcally sus-
ceptible to acriﬂavine (Table 2) as mentioned above. Because it
has been reported that SmvA is an important efﬂux pump for
acriﬂavine (Villagra et al., 2008), we hypothesized that SmvA may
be involved in the Hfq-mediated acriﬂavine susceptibility of Sal-
monella. Similarly, as Δhfq mutant, ΔsmvA mutant was more sen-
sitive to acriﬂavine (64-fold) than the wild-type strain (Table 2).
This phenotype is in good agreement with a previous report (Vil-
lagra et al., 2008). MIC of acriﬂavine against ΔsmvAΔhfq double
mutant was similar to that against ΔsmvA mutant, indicating that
deletion of smvA impaired the effect of hfq deletion on acri-
ﬂavine susceptibility. Moreover, psmvA, which expressed smvA,
conferred acriﬂavine resistance to ΔsmvAΔhfq double mutant.
MIC of acriﬂavine against ΔsmvAΔhfq/ psmvA strain is similar to
that against the wild-type strain (Table 2). Taken together, these
results indicated that Hfq regulates the intrinsic acriﬂavine resis-
tance of Salmonella and SmvA plays an important role in this
resistance because the drug susceptibility pattern of ΔsmvA was
same as that of Δhfq, and the deletion of hfq from ΔsmvA mutant
did not change the acriﬂavine susceptibility of this strain.

In this study, we investigated the role of Hfq in the drug
susceptibility of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028s
and found that Hfq plays a role in its intrinsic acriﬂavine resis-
tance and that SmvA efﬂux pump is involved in this resistance.
Interestingly, Δhfq mutant of Salmonella was speciﬁcally sensi-
tive to acriﬂavine among the tested compounds. This phenotype
is very different from Δhfq mutant of E. coli W3104 or MC4100
(Yamada et al., 2010). In case of E. coli, Δhfq mutant was sus-
ceptible to various compounds including acriﬂavine, benzalko-
nium, cefamandole, chloramphenicol, crystal violet, nalidixic acid,
novobiocin, oxacillin, and rhodamine 6G because Hfq positively

Role of Hfq in Salmonella drug resistance

regulates the production of the AcrB drug efﬂux pump (Yamada
et al., 2010). However, AcrB was considered not to be involved
in the Hfq-mediated intrinsic acriﬂavine resistance of Salmonella.
These observations suggest the differential regulation of genes by
Hfq between E. coli and Salmonella. Indeed, transcriptomic analy-
sis revealed that Hfq controls the Salmonella gene expression in
several horizontally acquired pathogenicity islands (SPI-1, -2, -4,
-5) that are not present in E. coli (Sittka et al., 2008). Unlike the
AcrAB drug efﬂux system, which is widely distributed throughout
all Enterobacteriaceae, homologs of SmvA are not found in E. coli
and Shigella spp. Villagra et al. (2008) suggested that acriﬂavine
is a substrate for both AcrB and SmvA efﬂux pumps, but SmvA

pump plays the major role in the efﬂux of acriﬂavine in Salmo-
nella. This may explain why SmvA and not AcrB drug efﬂux system
contributes to the Hfq-mediated drug resistance of Salmonella.
