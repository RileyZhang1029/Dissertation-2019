Abstract:  Human  ehrlichiosis  is  due  to  infection  by  tick  transmitted  bacteria  of  the  genus  Ehrlichia.  Based  on  a  
hypothesis  for  the  biogeography  of  deer  tick  transmitted  infections,  we  undertook  a  focused  search  for  the  Eurasian E. 
muris  in North American deer ticks. The search was  stimulated by anecdotal reports of E. muris-like infection in human 
ehrlichiosis  patients  from  Wisconsin.  We  analyzed  archived  adult  deer  ticks  collected  in  northern  Wisconsin  during  
the  1990s  by  specific  polymerase  chain  reaction  for  evidence  of  infection,  and  sequenced  amplification  products  to  
identify E. muris. About 1% of 760 adult deer ticks collected from Spooner, Wisconsin in the 1990s  contained E. muris 
DNA. We conclude that E. muris was present in North American deer ticks a decade ago and is likely to infect this human 
biting  vector  elsewhere  in  the  U.S.  Biogeographic  theory  and  molecular  phylogenetic  methods  can  facilitate  a  targeted 
search for potential zoonoses. 

Keywords: Ehrlichiosis, deer ticks, Wisconsin, Ehrlichia muris, Ixodes dammini, PCR. 

INTRODUCTION 

  Human ehrlichiosis, a zoonosis with a global distribution, 
is  an  acute  disease  of  varying  severity  comprising  fever, 
headache,  malaise  and  myalgia,  with  nonspecific  physical 
findings;  laboratory  findings  generally  include  leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia,  and  elevated  liver  function  tests.  The 
obligately intracellular alpha-proteobacterial genus Ehrlichia 
(Rickettsiales:  Anaplasmataceae)  comprises  5  recognized 
species,  all  tick-transmitted,  with  3  of  the  5  causing  human 
ehrlichiosis (E. canis, E. chaffeensis, and E. ewingii). In ad-
dition, numerous candidatus entities have been reported (“E. 
walkerii”,  “E.  shimanensis”,  “Ixodes  ovatus  ehrlichia”, 
“Panola  Mountain ehrlichia”  and others),  all from hard  ticks 
and  mainly  characterized  by  PCR  sequencing  [1].  Their  ca-
pacity  to  infect  humans  remains  to  be  described.  The  agent 
of  the  important  veterinary  disease  heartwater  (E.  rumi-
nantium)  is  not  known  to  be  zoonotic.  Ehrlichia  muris  was 
first  described  from  the  vole  Eothenomys  kageus  as  well  as 
from muroid rodents in Japan [2, 3] and has not been associ-
ated with human infection there. E. muris has also been iden-
tified from Ixodes persulcatus ticks across Russia and from I. 
ricinus  in Slovakia [4-7], suggesting the possibility that it  is 
a  member  of  the  Holarctic  microbial  guild  maintained  by 
rodent-feeding ticks in the I. persulcatus species complex [8, 
9].  These  ticks  are  human  biters  and  globally  are  the  main 
vectors  of  Lyme  disease.  Recently,  anecdotal  information 
has  been  presented  (ProMed  Mail,  15  May  2010,  archive 
#20100515.1593) on the identification of E. muris-like DNA 
from the blood of American patients who had presented with

signs  and  symptoms  compatible  with  human  anaplasmosis 
(human  granulocytic  ehrlichiosis  due  to  Anaplasma  phago-
cytophilum). Similar DNA was said to have been detected in 
deer  ticks  (I.  dammini,  the  main  American  vector  of  Lyme 
disease;  also  known  as  I.  scapularis)  as  well  but  no  details 
have  been  formally  reported.  The  case-patients  were  resi-
dents  of  Wisconsin  and  Minnesota,  an  area  we  have  previ-
ously  suggested  [8,  10,  11]  was  a  glacial  refugium  for  the 
deer  tick  microbial  guild  (Borrelia  burgdorferi,  Babesia  mi-
croti,  A.  phagocytophilum,  tick  borne  encephalitis  group 
viruses). Because of our hypothesis that E. muris is indeed a 
member  of  the  deer  tick  guild,  we  reasoned  that  it  might  be 
easily found in ticks from longstanding sites of transmission. 
Accordingly,  we  analyzed  archived  samples  of  adult  deer 
ticks  we  collected  from  vegetation  during  October  of  1992-
1997  in  Spooner, Wisconsin  for  evidence  of  infection  by  E. 
muris.  

  Adult  deer  ticks  (males  and  females)  were  collected  by 
sweeping  vegetation  in  a  study  site  in  Spooner,  Wisconsin 
during  October  1992-1997,  and  stored  desiccated  at  room 
temperature.  The  ticks  were  pooled  and  homogenized  in 
groups of 6 and their DNA extracted using alkaline lysis. To 
determine whether ticks contained E. muris DNA, we used a 
nested  PCR  targeting  the  citrate  synthase  gene  of  E.  muris. 
The primers used were EmCS638F/EmCS1349R [12] for the 
outer  reaction,  and  EmCS  innerF/  EmCS  innerR  (Table  1). 
Samples  testing  positive  for  E.  muris  were  confirmed  by 
amplifying  Groesl  and  16S  rRNA  gene  targets;  we  consid-
ered only those samples that were confirmed by at least one 
other target to be positive. We compared the prevalence of E. 
muris infection with that of A. phagocytophilum by PCR for 
the  latter  agent  using  the  nested  primer  set  BacA/1448r  and 
Ge9f/Ge10r  [13].  Amplicons  were  excised  from  agarose 
gels, purified, and commercially sequenced.

  Of  760  ticks,  7  (maximum  likelihood  estimate  of  preva-
lence  for  pooled  samples  0.94%  [95%  confidence  interval, 
0.42-1.9]) tested positive for E. muris-specific DNA. Phylo-
genetic  analysis (Fig. 1) demonstrates  that  the  sequences we 
detected  (GenBank  submissions  HQ660491-HQ660497)  in 
the  Spooner  ticks  clustered  with  those  from  Eurasian  E. 
muris,  and  we  conservatively  interpret  the  small  degree  of 
nucleotide  difference  as  due  to  geographic  variation  as  op-
posed to evidence for a “new” agent. We analyzed 670 of the 
760  ticks  for  A.  phagocytophilum  DNA  and  3  were  consid-
ered  positive  (MLE  0.45%  [0.12,  1.2]).  It  is  likely  that  the 
mode  of  storage  (desiccation)  diminished  sensitivity  of  the 
assays because we previously reported a prevalence of about 
4%  (by  microscopy)  for  A.  phagocytophilum  from  the 

Spooner  site  [14];  thus,  the  prevalence  of  E.  muris  is  likely 
greater.  

  We  conclude  that  E.  muris  was  present  in  Wisconsin 
more  than  a  decade  before  the  recent  anecdotal  report  of 
atypical  human  ehrlichiosis  cases,  and  that  it  was  as  preva-
lent in host-seeking adult deer ticks there as was A. phagocy-
tophilum.  The  Spooner  area  was  where  erythema  migrans 
was  first  noted  in  North  America  [15],  where  the  first  Mid-
western  cases  of  B.  microti  babesiosis  occurred  [16]  and 
where  the  first  cases  of  HGE  were  detected  [13].  Our  field 
sampling in Spooner during the 1990s reflected an interest in 
the  comparative  ecology  of  B.  microti,  A.  phagocytophilum 
and deer tick virus with respect to the New England terminal

1997.  DNA  sequences  of  other  Ehrlichia  spp.  were  downloaded  from  NCBI  Genbank,  aligned  using  ClustalW,  and  then  adjusted  by  eye 
using GeneDoc. MEGA was used to generate neighbor-joining trees for citrate synthase (left panel) and groesl (right panel) sequences using 
the Kimura 2-parameter model. 500 bootstrap replicates were done to assess the stability of the resulting branch nodes.

moraine  sites of longstanding  transmission. The detection of 
E.  muris  in  ticks  from  Spooner  is  consistent  with  (but  not 
proof  of)  our  hypothesis  of  a  glacial  refuge  where  the  deer 
tick  microbial  guild  has  been  present  since  its  likely  intro-
duction via Beringia. It may be that E. muris will be found in 
the  U.S.  wherever  deer  ticks  are  known  to  be  infected  by  a 
majority  of  the  guild  members.  Some  human  ehrlichiosis 
cases  may  eventually be demonstrated to comprise infection 
by E. muris.
