The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in the processing of emotionally significant stimuli, particularly the 
inhibition of inappropriate responses. We examined the role of the mPFC in regulation of fear responses using a diff erential fear 
conditioning procedure in which the excitatory conditioned stimulus (CS+) was paired with an aversive footshock and intermixed 
with the inhibitory conditioned stimulus (CS-). In the fi rst experiment, using rats as subjects, muscimol, a gamma-amino-butyric 
acid type A (GABAA) receptor agonist, or artifi cial cerebrospinal fl uid (aCSF) was infused intracranially into the mPFC across three 
conditioning sessions. Twenty-four hours aft er the last conditioning session, freezing response of the rats was tested in a drug-free 
state. Neither the muscimol nor the aCSF infusion had any eff ect on diff erential responding. In the second experiment, the same 
experimental procedure was used except that the infusion was made before the testing session rather than the conditioning sessions. 
Th  e results showed that muscimol infusion impaired diff erential responding: the level of freezing to CS- was indiscriminable from 
that to CS+. Taken together, these results suggest that the mPFC is responsible for the regulation of fear response by inhibiting 
inappropriate fear expressions.

INTRODUCTION

Since the historical case of Phineas Gage, a railroad worker 
whose brain damage drastically changed his personality, the 
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in the 
regulation of emotion [1-3]. For example, the mPFC is critical 
for the extinction of fear conditioned response (CR) where

the associative link between the conditioned stimulus (CS) 
and the aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) is suppressed 
following repeated presentations of the CS without the US [4-
6]. Converging evidence suggests that extinction involves post-
learning modulation rather than erasure or forgetting of learned 
fear response [7]. Lesions in the mPFC caused retardation of 
extinction process, delayed recall of extinction, and defi cits in the 
long-term retention of extinguished fear [6, 8, 9]. Moreover, results 
from human neuroimaging studies found correlation between 
mPFC activation and strength of extinction memory [10, 11].
The mPFC regulates fear response by modulating amygdala 
activity. The amygdala has been implicated in initial acquisition

of CS-US association [12], expression of learned fear response 
[13], and extinction of fear response [14, 15]. Interactions between 
the mPFC and amygdala, therefore, are indispensible for fear 
expression and inhibition [16-18]. Recent studies focused more 
on local networks within the mPFC and their connections with 
the amygdala. For example, Vidal-Gonzalez et al. proposed 
that excitatory and inhibitory interactions within the mPFC 
regulates fear response through modulation of amygdala activity 
[19]. Specifically, activity in the prelimbic subregion (PL) of 
the mPFC is critical for the expression of learned fear, whereas 
the infralimbic subregion (IL) is involved in the acquisition 
of extinction memory but not the expression of fear CRs [20]. 
Changes in intrinsic excitability of the IL regulate fear expression 
even before extinction [21]. In addition, Laviollete et al. showed 
that canabinoid receptor blockade in the mPFC interferes with the 
acquisition and expression of olfactory fear conditioning [16].
In a typical laboratory investigation of fear extinction, sessions of 
fear conditioning (acquisition) and extinction are clearly separated 
and serially presented. Interestingly, the interval between 
acquisition and extinction seems to change the behavioral 
outcome quite dramatically. Extinction training which would 
normally produce signifi cant reduction of fear response was not 
effective when the interval was shortened. This phenomenon, 
called immediate extinction deficit (IED) [22], has been 
proposed to result from lack of mPFC activation due to the short 
acquisition-to-extinction interval [23]. Taken together, when and 
how the mPFC modulates fear response through expression and 
inhibition of the fear circuit is still controversial.
A feasible but different approach to the problem of mPFC 
regulation of fear response is to present excitatory and inhibitory 
trials within the same session. Among variations of fear 
conditioning procedure, a differential conditioning paradigm 
involving the conditioned stimulus that signals an upcoming 
aversive or threatening US (CS+) and a stimulus that signals the 
absence of such stimulus (CS-) can be a useful model to investigate 
the role of excitatory and inhibitory processes in regulation of 
emotional responses [24]. Although some early studies using 
the differential procedure showed that mPFC lesion produced 
decreased discrimination between the CS+ and CS- which is 
primarily caused by increased responding to the CS- [25, 26], 
no prior studies have employed pharmacological inactivation of 
the mPFC to dissect its functional involvement across different 
stages. Th  erefore, we examined the role of the mPFC in diff erential 
fear conditioning using microinfusion of the GABAA receptor 
agonist muscimol. Due to high density of GABAA receptors 
[27], muscimol has been proved to be an efficient technique to 
transiently inactivate the mPFC [13]. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (225~250 g) were used as subjects. 
All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National 
Institutes of Health guideline for animal care and welfare. The 
animals were housed individually on a 12-h light/dark cycle with 
lights on at 9:00 A.M. They were maintained at temperature of 
21~24oC and given ad libitum access to food and water.

Apparatus
Differential fear conditioning and retention testing were 
conducted in one of two different conditioning chambers 
contained within a sound-attenuating cubicle. Each conditioning 
chamber rested on a load-cell platform (DACELL Co., Ltd., 
Chung-buk, Korea) that recorded chamber displacement in 
response to each rat’s motor activity. During retention test, these 
chambers were modifi ed for context shift , which included lining 
the side wall with a white board and treating with a different 
odor (Canadian balsam or cinnamon; Sigma). In addition, the 
whole chamber and cubicle were also switched with each other. 
The US was delivered through a grid floor attached to a shock 
generator (E13-14, Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA, 
USA). Delivery of the CS and the US was controlled by a custom-
made soft ware written in LabView (National Instruments, Austin, 
TX). Background noise (65dB) was provided by ventilation fans. A 
small red light (12V, 4W) was continuously on within the cubicle 
to provide dim illumination. Th  e apparatus was cleaned with 70% 
ethanol aft er each use.

Surgery for cannula implant
Th  e rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50mg/kg, 
i.p.) with supplemental injections given as needed. Stainless steel 
26-guage guide cannulae (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA, USA) were 
bilaterally implanted targeting the medial prefrontal cortex using 
coordinates from Paxinos and Watson [28]: 2.2 mm posterior to 
bregma, ±0.5 mm lateral to the midline and 3.5 mm ventral from 
dura for Experiment 1 using a dual guide cannula with 1-mm 
center-to-center distance. For Experiment 2, two single cannulae 
were implanted at an angle of 15o (2.9 mm posterior to bregma, 
±1.8 mm lateral to the midline and 3 mm ventral from dura). 
Implanted cannulae were secured by dental acrylic cemented over 
the anchoring screws attached on the skull. To prevent clogging of 
the guide cannulae, 33-guage dummy wires were inserted, which 
was temporally removed and replaced by injection cannulae for 
drug infusion.

inter-trial interval (ITI) was randomly varied between 250~350 
s. Twenty-four hours after the habituation session, all rats 
received a drug infusion (muscimol or artificial cerebrospinal 
fluid: aCSF) followed by a conditioning session 30 min later 
(Exp. 1). Th  e conditioning sessions included 10 randomly-mixed 
presentations of CS1 and CS2. Only one of the CSs was paired 
with the footshock US (0.5 mA, 1 s) that co-terminated with the 
CS (CS+). The other was presented alone (CS-). The assignment 
of the stimuli to CS+ or CS- was counterbalanced between 
subjects. The conditioning was repeated for three days. Twenty-
four hrs aft er the third conditioning session, the retention test was 
performed in the switched chamber where the rats received three 
presentations of CS+ and CS- in an alternating sequence without 
the US (total of 6). To reduce the variability, the CS duration was 
extended to 180 s. For Exp. 2, the procedure was identical to Exp. 
1 except that the drug infusion was performed 30 min before the 
retention test session. Conditioned fear response was measured 
by freezing which was defi ned as absence of all movements except 
for respiration. Th  e cumulative time spent freezing was measured 
by two experienced experimenters who were blind to the group 
assignment. Th  e discrimination ratio was calculated as the index 
of diff erential responding to the CSs using the following formula.

freezing CS+

According to this formula, a discrimination ratio of 1 indicates 
complete discrimination between CS+ and CS-, whereas 0.5 
indicates no discrimination. 

Histology
Following testing, rats were anesthetized with a lethal overdose 
of chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg) and perfused with saline followed 
by formalin. The brains were then removed, post-fixed in 10% 
formalin solution and transferred into 30% sucrose solution. 
When the brain sank to the bottom in the sucrose solution, 
coronal sections (50 μm thickness) were cut using a freezing 
microtome (Leica cryostat 1720, Germany). The sections then 
were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, stained with cresyl 
violet and coverslipped with Permount (Sigma). The slides were 
examined under a microscope for verifi cation of the cannulae tip 
location. Aft er histological reconstruction and close examination 
of brain sections, only the animals with injection sites within 
mPFC were included in the fi nal analysis (Fig. 2).

Drug and intracranial infusions
Muscimol (Sigma, St. Louise, MO, USA) was dissolved in 
artifi cial cerebrospinal fl uid (aCSF, pH 7.0~7.5), to a concentration 
of 0.1 μg /0.3 μl. A total amount of 0.3 μl/side of muscimol or aCSF 
was infused into each mPFC with 33-gauge infusion cannulae 
at a rate of 0.1 μl/min controlled by a programmable syringe 
pump (model 101, KD Scientifi c, Hollistion, MA). Following the 
infusion, rats were returned to their home cage and waited for 
20~30 min in vivarium before undergoing a behavioral procedure.

RESULTS

Experiment 1. Pre-conditioning muscimol infusion into the 
mPFC 
Experiment 1 was conducted to examine the role of the mPFC 
in the acquisition of differential fear response. Total of 15 rats 
(aCSF, n=8; muscimol, n=7) were microinfused with muscimol or 
aCSF into the mPFC just before each training session. Th  ere was 
no significant difference between groups on the discrimination 
ratio throughout the conditioning sessions (Fig. 3A: F(1,8)=0.346, 
not significant [n.s.]), repeated measures ANOVA). In the 24-
hr retention test with no drug treatment, the aCSF group and the 
muscimol group showed differential responding between CS+ 
and CS- (Fig. 3B). Both groups froze significantly more to the 
CS+ than to the CS- (aCSF group, t(7)=-5.685, p<.05 ; muscimol 
group, t(6)=-2.835, p<.05, paired t-test). The level of differential 
responding was also similar, such that the discrimination ratio was 
not diff erent between groups (Fig. 3A: t(8)=.191, n.s., independent 
t-test). 
To determine whether muscimol infusion into the mPFC altered 
pain sensitivity, reactivity to footshock was measured during the 
presentations of the aversive US on the fi rst conditioning trials in 

Exp. 1. Statistical analysis confi rmed that there was no signifi cant 
difference between the muscimol- and aCSF-infused groups 
(t(10)=-1.018, n.s., independent t-test). 

Experiment 2. Pre-testing muscimol infusion into the mPFC
Th  e purpose of Exp. 2 was to examine the role of the mPFC in the 
expression of diff erential fear response. In Exp. 2, rats underwent 
the same differential conditioning as Exp. 1 but without any 
drug infusion. Thirteen rats (aCSF, n=5; muscimol, n=8) were 
microinfused with muscimol or aCSF into the mPFC just before 
the retention test. Both groups showed no significant difference 
on any of the conditioning sessions (Fig. 3C: F(1,11)=0.052, n.s., 
repeated measures ANOVA). In the 24-hr retention test, however, 
only the aCSF group showed differential responding between 
CS+ and CS- (aCSF group, t(4)=-5.692, p < .05; muscimol group, 
t(7)=1.347, n.s., paired t-test). The aCSF group significantly 
froze more to CS+ than to CS-. In contrast, freezing to CS- in 
the muscimol group was greater than the aCSF group (Fig. 3D: 
t(4.599)=-4.467, p < .05, independent t-test). Also, the level of 
diff erential responding was diff erent, such that the discrimination 
ratio was higher in the aCSF group than in the muscimol group 
(Fig. 3C: t(4.324)=3.987, p < .05, independent t-test). 

DISCUSSION

Th  e current study tested the role of the mPFC in the acquisition 
and expression of diff erential fear responding. In Exp.1, both the 
muscimol-infused and aCSF-infused rats showed differential 
responding to the CSs indicating that formation of excitatory

associations between CS+ and the US and inhibitory association 
between CS- and the US were not dependent on the mPFC. On 
the other hand, in Exp. 2, when the same drug was applied before 
the test session, the differential responding was attenuated. That 
is, the rats with muscimol infusion showed as much freezing to 
the CS- as they did to the CS+, indicating that mPFC inactivation 
selectively impaired inhibitory responding to the CS- while 
sparing the excitatory responding. Taken together, the mPFC is 
particularly involved in regulation of fear expression based on 
associative memory of selective stimuli contingency [29, 30]. 
The current results are consistent with the studies of fear 
extinction in that extinction also involves inhibition of an 
existing response. In fact, Bouton claimed that extinction is a 
special case of conditioned inhibition [31]. Whereas conditioned 
fear response develops with increased cellular responding in 
the amygdala [32, 33], extinction involves cortical modulation 
of the excitatory circuit within the amygdala. For example, 
extinction modulates amygdala activity by activating inhibitory 
interneurons in the lateral nucleus (LA) [34] or intercalated 
cell mass in the central nucleus (CE) [17, 35]. Increased cellular 
activity within the mPFC was observed after extinction and 
stimulation of the mPFC enhanced extinction memory [19, 36]. 
Moreover, increased synaptic efficacy between the mPFC and 
the amygdala is highly predictive of the emergence and reduction 

of the conditioned fear response [37]. Remarkably, extinction 
was induced even in anesthetized rats as long as the activation 
of the mPFC accompanies repeated stimulation of the CS input 
pathway into the amygdala [38]. Th  e current results also showed 
that inhibition of fear response was impaired by the inactivation 
of the mPFC (Exp. 2). The resurgence of fear response to CS- 
despite the preceding extinction training could have resulted from 
blockade of inhibitory projection onto the fear network within 
the amygdala. Excitatory responding to CS+ was intact which is 
believed to depend on the amygdala itself [39]. 
Considering the critical role of the mPFC in extinction learning 
and fear inhibition, questions remain regarding the intact 
acquisition despite the inactivation of the mPFC during the 
diff erential conditioning (Exp. 1). One interpretation of the result 
is that neural plasticity for response inhibition could be established 
in an alternative structure if the mPFC activation is blocked. 
To support, studies employing a differential fear conditioning 
procedure have reported that manipulation of the mPFC did 
not influence initial association of discrimination [40, 41] and 
neuronal activity in the amygdala increased to the CS+ relative 
to the CS- [42, 43]. In addition, mPFC lesion did not impair 
discriminatory conditioning with food reinforcement [44]. Taken 
together, neuronal plasticity responsible for inhibitory association 
could be produced outside the mPFC while the structure is

unavailable. 
Recent studies emphasized the interaction between the mPFC 
and the amygdala through functionally distinct regions such as the 
IL and PL for post-acquisition modulation of fear response [20]. 
Specifically, the IL is involved in retrieval of extinction memory 
whereas the PL is closely linked with expression of fear response 
[19, 20]. The histological reconstruction of our data shows that 
most of the cannula tips located in the middle area, suggesting 
that the drug must have spread over to the IL and PL (Fig. 2). If the 
mPFC is involved in both fear expression and inhibition as some 
previous models have suggested, then the diff erential responding 
to the CS+ and CS- should have been equally attenuated. However, 
the current result indicates that the mPFC is involved more in 
down-regulation rather than up-regulation or maintenance of 
fear response. One possibility is that the procedural difference 
between extinction and differential conditioning procedure 
might have resulted in different types of learning which require 
the IL and PL to a varying degree. An extinction session is always 
presented serially some time after the acquisition. In contrast, 
inhibitory trials were intermixed with excitatory trials within the 
same session in our experiment. In sum, further study is needed 
to elucidate how the mPFC process and utilize inhibitory and 
excitatory stimuli and interact with parallel structures to generate 
an appropriate emotional response.
