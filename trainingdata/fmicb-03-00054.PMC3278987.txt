Hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is a major causative agent of blood-borne hepatitis, has
chronically infected about 170 million individuals worldwide and leads to chronic infection,
resulting in development of steatosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatocellular carcinoma associated with HCV infection is not only caused by chronic
inﬂammation, but also by the biological activity of HCV proteins. HCV core protein is known
as a main component of the viral nucleocapsid. It cooperates with host factors and pos-
sesses biological activity causing lipid alteration, oxidative stress, and progression of cell
growth, while other viral proteins also interact with host proteins including molecular chap-
erones, membrane-anchoring proteins, and enzymes associated with lipid metabolism to
maintain the efﬁciency of viral replication and production. HCV core protein is localized on
the surface of lipid droplets in infected cells. However, the role of lipid droplets in HCV infec-
tion has not yet been elucidated. Several groups recently reported that other viral proteins
also support viral infection by regulation of lipid droplets and core localization in infected
cells. Furthermore, lipid components are required for modiﬁcation of host factors and the
intracellular membrane to maintain or up-regulate viral replication. In this review, we sum-
marize the current status of knowledge regarding the exploitation of lipid components by
viral and host proteins in HCV infection.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major causative agent of chronic
liver disease including steatosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carci-
noma. Epidemiological studies indicate that HCV is also associated
with extrahepatic manifestations including type 2 diabetes melli-
tus, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, mixed cryoglobulinemia, and
Sjögren’s syndrome (Jacobson et al., 2010). It has been estimated
that there are 170 million patients worldwide, of whom most are
infected with HCV. Combination therapy with pegylated inter-
feron (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin has been the standard treatment
but it fails to cure ∼50% of treated patients (Soriano et al., 2009).
Hepatitis C virus belongs to the genus Hepacivirus of the fam-
ily Flaviviridae. The viral genome of HCV is characterized by a
single positive strand RNA with a nucleotide length of 9.6 kb
and it encodes a single polypeptide (Figure 1). This polypro-
tein is cleaved by host and viral proteases into structural and
non-structural proteins (Harada et al., 1991; Hijikata et al., 1991;
Grakoui et al., 1993a,b). Structural proteins, including the core
protein and two envelope proteins, and the viroporin p7 are located
within one-third of the N-terminal, while the remaining viral
proteins are classiﬁed as non-structural proteins which form a
replication complex with host factors (Grakoui et al., 1993c). HCV
core protein is cleaved by signal peptide cleavage and then released
from E1 (Santolini et al., 1994). After cleavage by signal peptidase
(SP), the C-terminal transmembrane region of the core protein
is further cleaved by signal peptide peptidase (SPP; Hussy et al.,

1996; McLauchlan et al., 2002). The nucleocapsid, composed of
matured core proteins and the viral genome, is surrounded by
an envelope composed of host lipids and viral envelope proteins
(Wakita et al., 2005). The life cycle of HCV is shown in Figure 2.
The viral envelope proteins play a role in the binding to host
receptors and membrane fusion for uncoating. Recently, several
groups reported that the viral particle binds to a very low-density
lipoprotein (VLDL), including apolipoprotein E (apoE), which is
required for the binding step (Andre et al., 2002; Nielsen et al.,
2006; Chang et al., 2007; Benga et al., 2010) as described below.
The virus infects hepatocytes via entry factors known as recep-
tors and co-receptors. The viral particle complex composed of the
enveloped nucleocapsid and VLDL including apoE (Merz et al.,
2011), is reported to bind to heparin sulfate (HS; Barth et al., 2003)
and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR; Agnello
et al., 1999), although Albecka et al. (2012) recently reported that
LDLR is required for optimal replication of the HCV genome
rather than entry of the infectious viral particle. Other host factors
may be involved in apoE-mediated entry. The HCV viral particle is
transferred to the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI; Scarselli
et al., 2002; Bartosch et al., 2003) and CD81 (Pileri et al., 1998)
through E2 binding and then enters cells with claudin-1 (CLDN1;
Evans et al., 2007) and occludin (OCLN; Ploss et al., 2009) by
endocytosis. The Niemann–Pick C1-like 1 cholesterol absorption
receptor has recently been reported to be an HCV cell entry fac-
tor that is involved in the entry step between post-binding and

The role of lipid components in HCV infection

FIGURE 1 | Structure of HCV. HCV RNA encodes a polyprotein composed of about 3,000 amino acids. The core protein, and two envelope proteins are
classiﬁed as structural protein, while NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B are non-structural proteins.

FIGURE 2 |The infection cycle of HCV. The HCV complex with VLDL binds to
entry factors on the surface of hepatocytes and then enters cells by
endocytosis. After uncoating, viral replication is carried out in the convoluted

membrane structure called the membranous web. The viral nucleocapsid

pre-fusion (Sainz et al., 2012). The viral envelope fuses with the
host plasma membrane in an endosome under a low pH con-
dition (Takikawa et al., 2000; Hsu et al., 2003; Blanchard et al.,
2006; Codran et al., 2006; Meertens et al., 2006; Tscherne et al.,
2006). The capsid protein and viral genome are expected to be
released into the cytoplasm of infected cells. The viral replication,
assembly, and budding are summarized in Figure 3 on the basis of
current information. The viral genome is translated dependent on

own internal ribosome entry site (Tsukiyama-Kohara et al., 1992)
and transcribed by the translated and processed NS3 to NS5B
(Lohmann et al., 1999). The viral protein NS4B induces a con-
voluted membrane structure (termed a membranous web) with
host lipid components and proteins, in which the viral replica-
tion is carried out (Egger et al., 2002; Gosert et al., 2005; Ferraris
et al., 2010). The newly synthesized viral positive stranded RNA
genome is released from the membranous web and passes to the

core protein via NS5A (Masaki et al., 2008). The core protein is
translocated on the surface of the lipid droplet or endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) membrane for efﬁcient formation of viral particles,
and then encloses the synthesized viral genome to form a capsid
near the membranous web (Miyanari et al., 2007; Boson et al.,
2011). The capsids are enclosed by an endoplasmic membrane
containing the viral envelope proteins E1 and E2 and are then
released into ER lumen side, since intracellular envelope proteins
are categorized as high-mannose type glycoproteins and the viral
particle composed of core proteins and envelope proteins egresses
into the lumen side of the intracellular compartment associated
with lipid droplets (Miyanari et al., 2007; Vieyres et al., 2010).
The viral particle is secreted through a host secretion pathway,
although the mechanism by which HCV particles are secreted in
infected cells remains poorly understood.

Although no effective vaccine for HCV has been developed,
antiviral drugs targeting to the viral and host factors have been
reported recently. The HCV replicon system was reported for a
screening system based on cultured cells (Lohmann et al., 1999)
and has been improved by modiﬁcation of cell lines and marker
genes and introduction of adaptive mutations in the region of the
viral RNA genome for high efﬁciency of viral replication (Blight
et al., 2000; Krieger et al., 2001; Lohmann et al., 2001; Ikeda et al.,
2002; Pietschmann et al., 2002). The complete infectious cycle of
HCV in cultured cells was established in a highly permissive cell
line by using the genotype 2a strain JFH1 or its chimeric recombi-
nant virus (Lindenbach et al., 2005; Wakita et al., 2005; Zhong et al.,
2005). A system based on the cultured cell line has been an exclu-
sive drug-screening system for ﬁnding antiviral compounds that
interfere with the process of viral RNA replication under intracel-
lular conditions. NS3 forms a complex with cofactor NS4A (Failla
et al., 1994, 1995; Koch et al., 1996). This interaction stabilizes
NS3 and retains it on the ER where it acquires the ability of a
protease against viral polyprotein (Wolk et al., 2000) and host
protein IPS-1/MAVS (Foy et al., 2005; Loo et al., 2006), which is
a molecule downstream of the RIG-I sensor molecule (Sumpter
et al., 2005; Loo et al., 2008). NS3 serine protease activity is a tar-
get of the direct acting HCV antiviral drugs known as telaprevir
and boceprevir, which are available clinically by combination ther-
apy with PEG-INF and ribavirin (Hofmann and Zeuzem, 2011).
The RNA helicase activity of NS3 and NS5B RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase are also used for drug-screening in particular (Hicham
Alaoui-Ismaili et al., 2000; Dhanak et al., 2002; Borowski et al.,
2003; De Francesco et al., 2003; Boguszewska-Chachulska et al.,
2004; Maga et al., 2005; Najda-Bernatowicz et al., 2010). Combi-
nation therapy using several compounds targeting host and viral
factors may be able to completely eradicate the virus and suppress
the pathogenicity induced by HCV infection.

Liver steatosis, which is characterized by accumulation of
lipid droplets in hepatocytes, is signiﬁcantly associated with the
incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in HCV-infected patients
(Ohata et al., 2003). Severe liver steatosis has been frequently found
in patients infected with the genotype 3a virus (Rubbia-Brandt
et al., 2000; Adinolﬁ et al., 2001). Successful clearance of HCV
reduces steatosis in genotype 3a patients, suggesting an associa-
tion between genotype 3a and severe steatosis. Furthermore, HCV
core protein derived from genotype 1 also induced liver steatosis

in mouse and cultured cells (Barba et al., 1997; Moriya et al.,
1997; Hope and McLauchlan, 2000). Lipid droplets containing
triglycerides and cholesteryl ester are increased in cells express-
ing core protein and are surrounded by the core protein (Hope
and McLauchlan, 2000). Non-structural proteins associate with
the lipid droplets surrounded by HCV core proteins to supply the
synthesized viral genome for viral assembly (Miyanari et al., 2007).
Other lipid components are reported to be involved in formation
of viral particles and the viral RNA replication as described below.
This review mainly summarizes the viral and host factors that are
associated with lipid metabolism with regard to HCV replication
and pathogenicity.

THE ROLE OF VLDL IN HCV INFECTION
Hepatitis C virus replicates in a convoluted membrane structure as
a membranous web (Egger et al., 2002; Gosert et al., 2005; Ferraris
et al., 2010) and assembles in the area of the ER membrane-
associated with lipid droplets surrounded by the core protein
(Miyanari et al., 2007). The LDLR has also been proposed to func-
tion as one of entry factors described above for HCV entry, in
which interaction between LDLR and HCV particles is facilitated
though interaction of the virus with host lipoprotein components
(Monazahian et al., 1999; Chang et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2007;
Miyanari et al., 2007; Gastaminza et al., 2008). HCV RNA contain-
ing particles derived from infected human serum were fractionated
in densities with a value of 1.03–1.25 g/ml (Thomssen et al., 1992,
1993). The HCV RNA particles of the fraction with a density of
lower than 1.06 g/ml possessed infectivity against chimpanzees,
while HCV RNA derived from fractions with a higher density
showed poor infectious ability (Bradley et al., 1991; Hijikata et al.,
1993). The infectious HCV particles form a LDL–virus complex
in the sera of human patients (Andre et al., 2002). An LDL–virus
complex was found in the fractions with very low to low buoyant
densities (1.03–1.25 g/ml), which varied with the stage of infec-
tion (Pumeechockchai et al., 2002; Carabaich et al., 2005). HCV
particles prepared from infected human serum forms a complex
with lipoproteins designated as lipo-viro-particles (LVP; Figure 3;
Andre et al., 2002; Nielsen et al., 2006). LVP includes triglycerides,
HCV RNA, core protein, and apolipoproteins B and E (Andre et al.,
2002), which are components of VLDLs and LDL (Brodsky et al.,
2004).

Very low-density lipoprotein is formed with a hydrophobic
particle composed of triglycerides and cholesteryl ester that is
surrounded by a surface coat containing phospholipid, free cho-
lesterol, and two dominant lipoproteins, apoB and apoE (review to
see Havel, 2000). Both apoB and apoE were found in a low-density
fraction of HCV RNA particles (Andre et al., 2002; Chang et al.,
2007). HCV virions could also be precipitated with antibodies
against apoB or apoE (Andre et al., 2002; Chang et al., 2007). ApoB
and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) are required
for HCV assembly and production, since knockdown of apoB or a
speciﬁc antibody to MTP could inhibit HCV production (Huang
et al., 2007; Gastaminza et al., 2008). However, another report sug-
gests that knockdown of apoB or antibodies to apoB exhibited no
signiﬁcant effect on HCV infectivity and production (Jiang and
Luo, 2009). The monoclonal antibodies against apoE neutralized
HCV infection in cultured cells (Chang et al., 2007; Jiang and Luo,

The role of lipid components in HCV infection

FIGURE 3 | Hepatitis C virus RNA replication and particle production on
lipid droplets and the ER membrane. HCV RNA replication and viral particle
production are thought to be carried out on the lipid droplets and ER
membrane. The viral proteins take advantage of host lipid metabolism and
intracellular compartments to produce viral components as described in the
text. Each step is described below. (1) A newly synthesized or uncoated vial
genomic RNA is translated to a viral polyprotein followed by a cleaving
polyprotein. (2) Matured non-structural proteins form replication a complex
with host factors. The core protein is translocated to lipid droplets by DGAT1.
In cells infected with the highly infectious strain (e.g., Jc1), the core protein
may be retained on ER membrane by cooperating with non-structural
proteins. (3) NS4B is involved in the convoluted membrane structure dubbed
the membranous web. Negative and positive strands of viral RNA are

synthesized by the replication complex based on each other. (4) The positive
strand of genomic RNA is enclosed with the core proteins, cooperating
non-structural proteins. Envelope proteins, NS2, and p7 may determine
recruitment of the core protein from lipid droplets to the ER membrane along
microtubules. Lipid droplets hemi-fused with ER membrane (Wolins et al.,
2006) may be involved in recruitment of core protein on the ER membrane
(4(cid:2)). (5) The core proteins enclose the viral RNA genome, and are then
surrounded by envelopes. Non-structural proteins and other factors may
support formation of nucleocapsid and budding. (6) VLDL binds to viral
particles to form LVP before or after budding. (7) The viral particles egress into
the ER lumen with VLDL including ApoE. The core protein upregulates
synthesis or storage of triglycerides and cholesteryl ester, cooperating with
host factors including DGAT1, and so on.

2009), while knockdown of apoE markedly reduced HCV infec-
tivity and infectious viral production without affecting viral entry
and replication (Chang et al., 2007; Berger et al., 2009; Jiang and
Luo, 2009). Hishiki et al. (2010) suggested that the isoforms 3 and
4, but not 2, of apoE are critical for HCV infectivity dependent
of afﬁnity to LDLR. Furthermore, NS5A could interact with apoE
in infected cells and colocalization of both proteins supports the
notion of intracellular interaction in infected cells (Benga et al.,
2010). The C-terminal alpha-helix region spanning from residue
205 to 280 was critical for NS5A–apoE interaction and viral pro-
duction (Cun et al., 2010). ApoE included in LVP may directly
bind to LDLR or LDLR-related proteins in hepatocytes (Figure 2),
since apoE is a ligand for all members of the LDLR gene family
(see review described by Herz et al., 2009). These results suggest
that apoE is an essential host factor for HCV entry.

LOCALIZATION OF THE CORE PROTEIN ON BOTH ER AND
LIPID DROPLETS IN INFECTED CELLS
Hepatitis C virus core protein is located at the N-terminus of the
HCV polyprotein (Figure 1). The HCV core protein is cleaved
from a precursor polyprotein by a SP, releasing it from an enve-
lope E1 protein. Then, the C-terminal transmembrane region of
the core protein is further processed by a SPP (McLauchlan et al.,
2002). The intramembrane processing of the HCV core protein
by SPP is critical for the production of infectious viral particles
(Okamoto et al., 2008). The C-terminal end of the mature HCV
core protein expressed in insect and human cell lines was deter-
mined to be Phe177 (Ogino et al., 2004; Okamoto et al., 2008).
Randall et al. (2007) reported that the introduction of an siRNA
targeted to SPP (called HM13) reduced the production of infec-
tious HCV particles, suggesting that SPP is required for HCV

particle production. Our previous report (Okamoto et al., 2008)
showed that the production of HCV in cells persistently infected
with the JFH1 strain was impaired by treatment with an SPP
inhibitor and that JFH1 viruses bearing SPP-resistant mutations in
the core protein failed to propagate in a permissive cell line. These
data suggest that intramembrane processing of HCV core protein
by SPP is required for viral propagation. Matured core protein was
found in a detergent-resistant membrane fraction, which was dis-
tinct from the classical lipid rafts (Matto et al., 2004). Our data also
suggest that cleavage of HCV core protein by SPP is required for
localization of HCV core protein in detergent-resistant membrane
fractions including cholesterol and sphingolipid (Figure 3, step 4
and 5). Detergent-resistant membrane fractions may be derived
from the membranous web where the viral replication complex
synthesizes the viral RNA genome, since the replication complex
is fractionated in lipid raft fractions including Vesicle-associated
membrane protein-associated protein (VAP)-A, cholesterol, and
sphingolipid (Figure 3, step 3; Shi et al., 2003; Aizaki et al., 2004;
Gao et al., 2004; Sakamoto et al., 2005). Furthermore, an HCV
core protein mutation resistant to SPP results in delayed local-
ization of HCV core protein on lipid droplets and reduction of
virus production (Targett-Adams et al., 2008). These reports sug-
gest that cleavage of HCV core protein by SPP is required for its
suitable intracellular localization for the viral assembly. Sequence
analysis of the core protein suggests that high hydrophobicity is
found in the region from amino acid residues 119 to 174, which
is called domain 2 (Hope and McLauchlan, 2000). Domain 2 is
critical for localization of the core protein on lipid droplets and
shares common features with the core protein of GBV-B, but not
of other viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family (Hope et al.,
2002). When three hydrophobic amino acids, Leu139, Val140,
and Leu144, in the most hydrophobic peak in domain 2 were
replaced with Ala to reduce hydrophobicity, the triple mutations
in the core protein led to resistance to SPP cleavage, dislocation
of the detergent-resistant membrane, and a reduction in virus
production (Okamoto et al., 2004, 2008). Furthermore, compara-
tive analysis between JFH1 and Jc1 suggest that binding strength
of domain 2 of core for lipid droplets determines efﬁciency of
virus assembly (Shavinskaya et al., 2007). These results suggest
that hydrophobicity of domain 2 in the core protein is required
for lipid droplet localization, SPP cleavage, and virus production.
Host lipid biogenesis is responsible for replication and assem-
bly. HCV core protein contributes to the accumulation and pro-
duction of host lipid components and is detected on the surface
of lipid droplets (Hope and McLauchlan, 2000). The core protein
is translocated into the lipid droplets near the replication complex
and encloses newly synthesized viral RNA to form the nucleocap-
sid (Figure 3, step 2–4 or 4
), egresses into the lumen side of the
ER, then is surrounded with host lipid components and viral enve-
lope proteins (Figure 3, step 5; Miyanari et al., 2007). HCV core
protein interacts with diacylglycerol acyl transferase 1 (DGAT1),
which is required for the trafﬁcking of core protein to lipid droplets
(Figure 3, step 2; Herker et al., 2010). However, the translocation of
the core protein to lipid droplets may not be required for efﬁcient
production of viral particles. The recombinant virus Jc1 exhibits
a higher virus titer than the JFH1 strain (Lindenbach et al., 2006;
Pietschmann et al., 2006). The core protein of the Jc1 strain is

(cid:2)

hardly detected on lipid droplets in infected cells and is mainly
localized on ER membranes, together with envelope protein E2
(Miyanari et al., 2007; Shavinskaya et al., 2007; Boson et al., 2011).
Expression of p7 increases the ER localization of core protein in
the absence of envelope proteins (Boson et al., 2011). However,
Miyanari et al. (2007) reported that the core protein of the Jc1
strain was mainly localized with envelope proteins on ER in cells
transfected with a complete viral genome, but on lipid droplets in
cells that were transfected with the viral genome lacking envelope
protein genes. Expression of envelope proteins and p7 may deter-
mine intracellular localization of the core protein with regard to
viral assembly (Figure 3, step 2 and 4 or 4

).

(cid:2)

NS2 has been reported to be involved in the assembly process
of HCV particles (Jones et al., 2007; Jirasko et al., 2008; Dentzer
et al., 2009). NS2, which is composed of three transmembrane
regions and a cytoplasmic domain in order after p7 (Lorenz
et al., 2006), is known as the autoprotease of which C-terminal
cytoplasmic domain is involved in cis cleavage at the NS2–NS3
junction (Santolini et al., 1995; Yamaga and Ou, 2002; Lorenz
et al., 2006). Genetic interaction was implied between the N-
terminal region of NS2 and the upstream structural proteins,
since the ﬁrst transmembrane of NS2 was identiﬁed as a genetic
determinant for infectivity by construction of chimeric HCV
with various genotypes (Pietschmann et al., 2006). Analyses by
co-immunoprecipitation and imaging microscopy for interaction
between NS2 and other viral proteins in cultured cells suggest that
NS2 interacts with p7 and E2 on the ER-derived dotted struc-
ture closed to lipid droplets that are surrounded by HCV core
protein (Popescu et al., 2011). NS2 also interacts with NS3/4A
to recruit the core protein from lipid droplets to the cytoplas-
mic motile puncta along microtubules (Counihan et al., 2011).
HCV p7 is a short hydrophobic protein composed of 63 amino
acids and is encoded between the structural and non-structural
proteins (Carrere-Kremer et al., 2002). The cytoplasmic loop of
p7 is located between the N-terminal and C-terminal transmem-
brane regions (Carrere-Kremer et al., 2002). HCV p7 is known
as a viroprotein that forms homooligomerize to be a ion channel,
which is then involved in assembly and release of virus particle
in infected cells by modulating pH equilibration in intracellular
vesicles (Carrere-Kremer et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2007; Steinmann
et al., 2007; Wozniak et al., 2010). Mutations of conserved amino
acids required for ion channel activity impaired the production
of infectious virus (Jones et al., 2007). However, recruitment of
HCV core protein from lipid droplets to the ER assembly site
was independent of the ion channel activity of HCV p7 (Boson
et al., 2011). HCV p7 enhanced ER localization of the core protein
without other viral proteins regardless of viral genotype, although
compatibilities between two transmembrane regions of p7 and
the ﬁrst transmembrane domain of NS2 are responsible for ER
localization of core protein and infection (Boson et al., 2011). The
second transmembrane region of p7, rather than the ﬁrst, is critical
for compatibilities with NS2 regarding recruitment of core protein
to the ER assembly site, although both transmembrane regions of
p7 are important to sustain infectivity (Boson et al., 2011). These
reports speculate that localization of the core protein on lipid
droplets may contribute to suppression of virus production and
maintenance of persistent HCV infection, while localization of the

core protein on ER may positively support virus production under
the fulminant condition.

REGULATION OF HOST LIPID METABOLISM BY THE CORE
PROTEIN
The mechanisms by which the core protein can induce liver dis-
eases and extrahepatic manifestations are unknown. Liver steato-
sis, which is one of the characteristics associated with persistent
HCV infection, develops by accumulation of triglyceride-rich
lipids in hepatocytes. However, the precise functions of HCV pro-
teins in the development of fatty liver remain unknown due to
the lack of an adequate system to investigate the pathogenesis of
HCV. HCV core protein expression has been shown to induce
lipid droplets in cell lines and hepatic steatosis and hepatocel-
lular carcinoma in transgenic mice (Barba et al., 1997; Moriya
et al., 1997; Hope and McLauchlan, 2000). The lipid composition
of the core-transgenic mouse is similar to that of a hepatitis C
patient (Koike et al., 2010; Miyoshi et al., 2011). These reports
suggest that HCV core protein plays an important role in the
development of various types of liver failure, including steato-
sis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Biosynthesis of triglycerides is
mainly regulated by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein
(SREBP)-1c. It has been reported that many genes regulated by
SREBPs were induced during the early stage of HCV infection
in the livers of chimpanzees (Bigger et al., 2004). Our study has
demonstrated that the core protein enhances the binding activity
of the LXRα–RXRα complex to the srebp-1c promoter in a PA28γ-
dependent manner, resulting in upregulation of SREBP-1c and its
regulating genes (Moriishi et al., 2007). The activation may be
mediated by the direct interaction between the core protein and
RXRα (Tsutsumi et al., 2002). Another mechanism is thought to be
suppression of lipid secretion. Reduced serum levels of cholesterol
and apolipoprotein B have been reported in patients with severe
hepatitis C and core-transgenic mice (Perlemuter et al., 2002). The
MTP regulates the assembly and secretion of VLDLs consisting of
apolipoprotein E, cholesterol, and triglycerides. In core-transgenic
mice, MTP-speciﬁc activity is signiﬁcantly decreased (Perlemuter
et al., 2002). In addition, DGAT1, which plays an important role
in trafﬁcking core protein from lipid droplets to the ER mem-
brane (Herker et al., 2010), was reported to delay the turnover
of lipid droplets that are coated by the core protein (Harris et al.,
2011; Figure 3). Furthermore, increases in saturated and monoun-
saturated fatty acids enhance HCV RNA replication (Kapadia
and Chisari, 2005). The core protein can enhance the produc-
tion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by induction of induced
nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) or by damage to the mitochon-
drial electron transport system, contributing to the emergence
of hepatocellular carcinoma (Moriya et al., 2001; Okuda et al.,
2002; Nunez et al., 2004), suggesting that accumulation of lipids
hastens the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma by enhanc-
ing ROS production. The core protein is reported to be degraded
by PA28gamma-dependent, but ubiquitin-independent, protea-
some activity, and directly binds to PA28gamma (Moriishi et al.,
2003; Suzuki et al., 2009). PA28gamma knockdown diminished
liver steatosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and insulin resistance
induced by HCV core protein in the mouse liver (Moriishi et al.,
2007). After our reports, several groups found that PA28gamma

plays an important role in cell cycling by degradation of SRC-
3, p16, p19, and p53 (Li et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007; Zhang
and Zhang, 2008). Furthermore, HCV propagation in a cell cul-
ture system is potently suppressed by PA28gamma knockdown,
regardless of cell growth (Moriishi et al., 2010). One possibility is
that E6AP-dependent ubiquitination of the core protein in cyto-
plasm is competitively suppressed by peptide fragments deduced
from nuclear core protein. However, there is still the possibility
of an indirect effect of PA28gamma, since potent reduction of
PA28gamma, but not intermediate reduction, can induce nuclear
accumulation of HCV core protein in cultured cells and the mouse
liver, but both potent and intermediate reductions could suppress
viral production (Moriishi et al., 2007, 2010; Cerutti et al., 2011).
Further study will be required to clarify the mechanism by which
PA28gamma regulates core-induced liver diseases and the HCV
life cycle.

NS3/4A AND LIPID DROPLETS
The NS3 also cleaves the host adaptor proteins IPS-1/MAVS and
TRIF to modulate TLR and RIG-I signaling, resulting in inhibi-
tion of type I interferon production (Ferreon et al., 2005; Li et al.,
2005a,b; Cheng et al., 2006; Loo et al., 2006). It is speculated that
NS3 suppresses the activation of host innate immunity induced
by HCV RNA and then contributes to persistent infection with
HCV. NS3/4A may be responsible for not only the replication, but
also the virus assembly and production by interaction with viral
and host proteins on a region close to lipid droplets/ER assem-
bly site. NS3/4A interacts with NS2 cooperating with p7 and E2
to recruit the core protein from lipid droplets to the cytoplasmic
motile puncta along microtubules (Boson et al., 2011; Counihan
et al., 2011; Popescu et al., 2011). HCV NS3/4A also interacts with
host protein Y-box-binding protein-1 (YB-1) and inﬂuences the
equilibrium between viral replication and infectious particle pro-
duction (Chatel-Chaix et al., 2011). Knockdown of YB-1 impaired
HCV RNA replication, regardless of the viral genotype, but did
not affect NS3/4A autoprocessing and MAVS cleavage (Chatel-
Chaix et al., 2011). JFH1 infection allowed YB-1 to translocate
to lipid droplets containing core protein and NS3 (Chatel-Chaix
et al., 2011), although knockdown of YB-1 enhanced the produc-
tion of viral infectious particles (Chatel-Chaix et al., 2011). YB-1
may cooperate with NS3/4A to negatively regulate the steps after
replication and to positively regulate viral replication.

NS5A AND CYCLOPHILINS
The peptide bond cis/trans isomerase converts between cis and
trans peptide bonds leading to correct folding of the protein sub-
strate. Peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) includes the
families of cyclophilin (Fischer et al., 1989), FK506-binding pro-
teins (FKBP; Siekierka et al., 1989a,b) and parvulins (Rahfeld
et al., 1994), and the secondary amide peptide bond cis/trans iso-
merase (Schiene-Fischer et al., 2002). Cyclophilin and FKBP are
categorized as immunophilins, which are targeted by the immuno-
suppressants cyclosporin and FK506, respectively (Liu et al., 1991).
Some cyclophilins and FKBP8 were shown to interact with NS5B
and/or NS5A and to regulate HCV replication (Watashi et al., 2005;
Okamoto et al., 2006), suggesting that immunophilins could lead
to promising therapies for chronic hepatitis C, as discussed below.

The role of lipid components in HCV infection

Cyclosporin A and its derivatives, which target cyclophilins,
were shown to impair HCV RNA replication and to exhibit efﬁ-
cacy in hepatitis C patients (Watashi et al., 2003; Ishii et al., 2006).
Inoue et al. (2003) reported cyclosporin A treatment of HCV in a
clinical trial. Cyclosporin derivatives lacking the ability to interact
with cyclophilin lost their inhibitory effect on HCV replication
(Watashi et al., 2005). Cyclophilin B is reported to be a 20-kDa
secreted neurotropic factor for spinal cord cells in chick embryos
(Spik et al., 1991), and is secreted into human milk and blood
(Spik et al., 1991; Allain et al., 1994). Cyclophilin B speciﬁcally
interacts with NS5B, the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
around the ER of the HCV replicon cells, and promotes NS5B’s
association with viral RNA (Watashi et al., 2005). Cyclosporin A
(CsA) was shown to disrupt the interaction between NS5B and
cyclophilin B (Watashi et al., 2005). Treatment with cyclosporin
A and knockdown of cyclophilin B suppressed the replication of
HCV. However, several groups reported that interaction between
NS5A and cyclophilin A is more important for HCV replication
than interaction between NS5B and cyclophilin B. There is a grow-
ing consensus that cyclophilin A in particular is a crucial factor
during HCV replication. A number of point mutations in both
NS5A and NS5B have been reported to be associated with in vitro
resistance to cyclophilin A (Yang et al., 2008; Chatterji et al., 2009;
Kaul et al., 2009). Direct interaction between cyclophilin A and
NS5B or NS5A has been observed (Yang et al., 2008). Several CsA-
analogs, i.e., NIM811 (Ma et al., 2006), DEB025, and SCY-635
(Hopkins et al., 2010), are currently in preclinical and clinical
development. DEB025 disrupts the interaction between NS5A
and cyclophilin A and suppresses cyclophilin A isomerase activity.
Although experimental differences in cell lines and replicons may
affect employment of cyclophilins in HCV replication, the main
molecule targeted by the cyclosporin analogs used clinically so far
seems to be cyclophilin A.

The treatment with CsA has been associated with increased
susceptibility to atherosclerosis and the development of hyper-
lipidemia (reviewed by Kockx et al., 2010). Treatment with CsA
upregulated activity of cholesteryl ester transfer protein and sup-
pressed lipoprotein lipase activity (Tory et al., 2008). Upregulation
of cholesteryl ester by cholesteryl ester transfer protein could
lead to accumulation of lipoprotein with cholesteryl ester. The
report by Anderson et al. (2011) suggests that cyclophilin A and
cyclophilin 40 are important for not only viral replication, but also
the release of infectious viral particles. NIM811 treatment sup-
presses virus production and viral RNA replication (Goto et al.,
2006). NIM811 treatment led to enlargement of lipid droplets and
apoB crescent formation in replicon cells, but not naïve Huh7
cell line, while decreasing apoB secretion and the number of
lipid droplets, rendering NS5A dislocation with apoB (Anderson
et al., 2011). Knockdown of cyclophilins A and 40 in replicon
cells showed the similar changes in lipid droplets size and apoB
localization, comparing with NIM811 treatment (Anderson et al.,
2011). Cyclophilins A and 40 may regulate lipid trafﬁcking in the
presence of HCV proteins to support secretion of viral particles.

NS5A/B AND MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS
Host lipids are well known to be essential components in the
viral life cycle, including the assembly, budding, and replication of

various viruses (Chen et al., 2005; Giese et al., 2006; Mannova et al.,
2006; Oomens et al., 2006). In the case of HCV, several types of
lipids are required for the HCV life cycle. Saturated and monoun-
saturated fatty acids, but not polyunsaturated fatty acids, enhance
HCV RNA replication (Kapadia and Chisari, 2005), suggesting
that lipid biogenesis is involved in HCV replication. HCV parti-
cles bind to lipoprotein receptors for entry (Agnello et al., 1999;
Scarselli et al., 2002) and are believed to exist with lipoproteins in
the serum of infected patients (Thomssen et al., 1992). There is also
evidence that HCV uses the VLDL assembly and secretion path-
way for maturation and secretion of viral particles (Huang et al.,
2007; Gastaminza et al., 2008). Cholesterol and sphingolipids are
employed for virion maturation and infectivity, since depletion of
cholesterol or down-regulation of sphingomyelin reduces infec-
tivity (Aizaki et al., 2008). Accumulation of lipid components in
the liver leads to liver steatosis, and is associated with progression
to liver ﬁbrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as described above.
Hepatitis C virus replication is suppressed by an inhibitor of
geranylgeranyl transferase I, but not by that of farnesyl transferase
(Ye et al., 2003). Geranylgeranylate is known as an intermediate
found in the mevalonate pathway and is covalently bound to
various cellular proteins that are associated with plasma or the
intracellular membrane (Horton et al., 2002). Immunoprecipita-
tion analysis revealed that NS5A interacts with FBL2 (Wang et al.,
2005a). The F-box motif is located in the N-terminus of FBL2,
followed by 11 leucine-rich repeats (Ilyin et al., 1999) and the
CAAX motif, which is thought to be modiﬁed by geranylgeranyla-
tion (Wang et al., 2005a). The F-box motif is generally essential for
the formation of the ubiquitin ligase complex (Ilyin et al., 1999),
suggesting that FBL2 regulates the ubiquitination of host or viral
proteins through the interaction with NS5A. Another possibility is
that FBL2 retains the viral replication complex by interacting with
NS5A (Figure 3, step 3).

Screening of a genome-wide siRNA library revealed phos-
phatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4KA) and COPI vesicle coat
complex as a human gene associated with HCV replication (Big-
ger et al., 2004; Borawski et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Tai et al.,
2009; Trotard et al., 2009; Vaillancourt et al., 2009; Reiss et al.,
2011). Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, which is associated with
oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) and CERT (Peretti et al., 2008;
Banerji et al., 2010) as described below, is increased by HCV infec-
tion (Bigger et al., 2004; Hsu et al., 2010; Reiss et al., 2011; Tai
and Salloum, 2011). PI4KA is co-localized with NS5A and double
stranded RNA in the replication platform composed of detergent-
resistant lipid components, known as a membranous web, and
is critical for HCV replication at posttranslational stages in the
membranous web (Berger et al., 2009). NS5A can interact with
PI4KA (Berger et al., 2011; Lim and Hwang, 2011; Reiss et al.,
2011) and recruit PI4KA to the membranous web (Berger et al.,
2009; Tai et al., 2009; Reiss et al., 2011; Tai and Salloum, 2011). Fur-
thermore, PI4KA, but not phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III beta,
induces the membranous web structure under the non-replicative
condition (Berger et al., 2011; Lim and Hwang, 2011; Reiss et al.,
2011). Biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate by PI4KA
that is recruited by NS5A in the membranous web may be required
for HCV replication and can be an endogenous biomarker of the
membranous web (Figure 3, step 3).

The role of lipid components in HCV infection

Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins were
originally identiﬁed as proteins that bind to vesicle-associated
membrane protein (VAMP) in the nematode Aplysia and were des-
ignated as VAMP-associated protein 33 kDa (later renamed VAP-A;
Skehel et al., 1995). Furthermore, one homolog and its splicing
variant were reported as VAP-B and -C, respectively (Nishimura
et al., 1999). VAP is classiﬁed as a type II membrane protein, and
is composed of three functional domains: major sperm protein
(MSP), which occupies the N-terminal half region, the coiled-
coil domain, and the transmembrane domain. VAP-A shares 60%
identity with VAP-B, while VAP-C is the splicing variant of VAP-B
that lacks the coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (Nishimura
et al., 1999). GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation analy-
ses revealed that NS5A and NS5B interact with human VAP-A/B
and that the N-terminal MSP domain and the coiled-coil domain
of VAP-A/B are responsible for the binding to NS5B and NS5A,
respectively (Tu et al., 1999; Hamamoto et al., 2005). In addition,
systematic RNAi screening revealed that 62 target host genes are
involved in HCV RNA or proteins including VAP-A/B (Randall
et al., 2007). Several reports suggest that HCV replication takes
place on the membranous web (Shi et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2004;
Sakamoto et al., 2005). NS4B is predominantly associated with a
lipid-raft-like detergent-resistant fraction equivalent to the mem-
branous web, and both NS5A and NS5B were co-localized in a
similar fraction in the presence of NS4B (Sakamoto et al., 2005).
VAP-A was also localized in a detergent-resistant fraction, suggest-
ing that it plays an important role in HCV replication because the
dominant negative mutant of VAP-A suppressed the replication
of HCV RNA (Gao et al., 2004). VAP-B forms a homodimer and
heterodimer with VAP-A, and knockdown of VAP-A or VAP-B led
to substantial suppression of HCV replication (Hamamoto et al.,
2005). These ﬁndings suggest that VAP-A and -B positively regulate
HCV replication by binding to NS5A/B.

The physiological function of VAPs was reported to be traf-
ﬁcking of ceramide and cholesterol between ER and the Golgi
apparatus. Several VAP-interacting proteins share the FFAT motif
(two phenylalanines in an acidic tract), which has the consensus
amino acid sequence EFFDAxE, as determined by a comparison
among oxysterol binding proteins, OSBP-related proteins (ORPs;
Loewen et al., 2003), and the ceramide transport protein CERT
(Hanada et al., 2003; Kawano et al., 2006), contributing to the
regulation of lipid metabolism. OSBP binds and transports cho-
lesterol or hydroxycholesterol from ER to the Golgi (Ridgway
et al., 1992; Wang et al., 2005b), while CERT binds and trans-
ports ceramide from ER to the Golgi, where the ceramide is
converted to sphingolipids (Kumagai et al., 2005). Altering the
sphingomyelin/ceramide ratio of the plasma membrane can effect
HCV entry via the cell surface expression of CD81 (Voisset et al.,
2008). OSBP mediates HCV secretion while binding to NS5A
and VAP-A (Amako et al., 2009). Inhibition of CERT function

effectively suppressed HCV release regardless of RNA replication
(Aizaki et al., 2008). Phosphorylation of CERT and OSBP by pro-
tein kinase D negatively regulates VAPs binding to CERT and OSBP
resulting in an effect on HCV infection (Amako et al., 2011). HCV
NS5A may allow VAP-A/B to provide ceramide and cholesterol
to replication complexes for upregulation of virus propagation
(Figure 3, step 3).

The VAP-B-splicing variant VAP-C interacts with NS5B via the
short form of the MSP domain and then suppresses the HCV repli-
cation by disrupting binding of other VAPs to NS5B (Kukihara
et al., 2009). Expression of VAP-C is observed in various tissues
except for the liver, suggesting that tissue distribution of VAP-C
determines the tropism of HCV infection (Kukihara et al., 2009).
These ﬁndings suggest that VAP-C negatively regulates HCV repli-
cation by inhibiting the interaction between VAP-A/B and NS5B.
Furthermore, expression of VAP-C was negligible in B cells pre-
pared from chronic hepatitis C patients, in whom B cells included
HCV particles (Ito et al., 2010), and expression of the full HCV
genome in B cells induced B-cell lymphoma in a conditional
transgenic mouse (Kasama et al., 2010), suggesting that HCV
infection increases the chance of developing B-cell lymphomas
via dysregulation of lipid metabolism.

CONCLUSION
This review summarizes several recently reported viral and host
factors that exploit lipid components to support HCV infection.
The mechanism by which HCV proteins cooperate with host fac-
tors to exploit lipid components and to regulate lipid metabolism
in the infection has not been elucidated completely. The aim of
identifying host factors is effective and stable therapy; targeting
the host factors might be done to prevent the emergence of resis-
tant viruses. Cyclosporin analogs will be used clinically in the
near future. Wide screening and proteomics analyses have revealed
novel host factors that are required for HCV replications over the
past decade. The mechanism by which HCV infection induces for-
mation of membranous web in infected cells has been unknown
yet, although NS4B is involved in formation of membranous web
(Egger et al., 2002; Gosert et al., 2005; Ferraris et al., 2010). We also
found several host proteins to be NS4B-associating host factors by
proteomics analysis based on the TargetMine program (Tripathi
et al., 2010). Further study will be required to identify the promi-
nent factors essential for lipid metabolism that are associated with
each step in the HCV life cycle and to develop effective and stable
therapies for hepatitis C.
