CTX-M [a major type of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)] producing Escherichia
coli are increasingly involved in human infections worldwide. The aim of this study was to
investigate potential reservoirs for such strains: soils, cattle, and farm environment. The
prevalence of blaCTX-M genes was determined directly from soil DNA extracts obtained
from 120 sites in Burgundy (France) using real-time PCR. blaCTX-M targets were found in
20% of the DNA extracts tested. Samples of cattle feces (n = 271) were collected from
182 farms in Burgundy.Thirteen ESBL-producing isolates were obtained from 12 farms and
further characterized for the presence of bla genes. Of the 13 strains, ﬁve and eight strains
carried blaTEM-71 genes and blaCTX-M-1 genes respectively.Ten strains of CTX-M-1 producing
E. coli were isolated from cultivated and pasture soils as well as from composted manure
within two of these farms. The genotypic analysis revealed that environmental and animal
strains were clonally related. Our study conﬁrms the occurrence of CTX-M producing E. coli
in cattle and reports for the ﬁrst time the occurrence of such strains in cultivated soils. The
environmental competence of such strains has to be determined and might explain their
long term survival since CTX-M isolates were recovered from a soil that was last amended
with manure 1 year before sampling.

INTRODUCTION
The production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)
is one of the most signiﬁcant mechanisms of resistance to oxy-
iminocephalosporin antibiotics in E. coli (Pitout and Laupland,
2008). Among these enzymes, the CTX-M type ESBLs have
emerged worldwide, they have progressively replaced the TEM and
SHV families (Bonnet, 2004). To date, 123 blaCTX-M genes have
been reported1, the corresponding CTX-M enzymes are clustered
in ﬁve groups, group 1, 9, and 2 being predominant. The producing
organisms are sometimes involved in nosocomial infections but
are widely encountered in community settings (Arpin et al., 2009;
Woerther et al., 2010). Their rate of dissemination might suggest
the occurrence of environmental reservoirs potentially leading to
human contamination through water, food consumption or direct
contact with animals (Leverstein-Van Hall et al., 2011). There are
many descriptions of fecal carriage of such organisms among food-
producing animals especially poultry (broilers) and pigs (Costa
et al., 2009; Bortolaia et al., 2010; Cortes et al., 2010). The reports
concerning livestock cattle are much less abundant (Horton et al.,
2011), and there is no published data about the prevalence of
CTX-M producing E. coli in soils. Nevertheless cultivated soils are
frequently fertilized with agricultural or urban organic residues

that may contain antibiotic resistant microorganisms (Moodley
and Guardabassi, 2009; Reinthaler et al., 2010) and thus might act
as environmental reservoirs.

The aim of this study was to develop an integrated approach
encompassing soils, livestock, and farm environment in a whole
region (Burgundy, France). A systematic large scale study was con-
ducted using a molecular detection approach to detect blaCTX-M
directly from soil DNA extracts. Conventional bacteriological
methods were used to isolate ESBL-producing E. coli from cat-
tle feces from 182 farms. When positive animals were detected, the
corresponding farm environment, i.e., cultivated and pasture soils
as well as cattle manure was sampled and analyzed by bacterio-
logical methods. All environmental and animal isolates recovered
during the study have been subjected to genotypic characterization
and blaCTX-M genes have been sequenced.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SOIL SAMPLING
Soils were sampled in the “Réseau de Mesures de la Qualité des
Sols” (RMQS= French Soil Quality Monitoring Network) which
is a network based on the sampling of soil with a 16× 16 km sys-
tematic grid covering the whole French territory (Arrouays et al.,
2002). The RMQS consisted in 2200 monitoring sites, which are
located close to the center of each 16× 16 km cell. Corresponding

CTX-M-producing E. coli from soil and cattle

land covers were recorded and categorized as: large scale crops,
pastures, orchards, vineyards, natural vegetation such as forests
or meadows. Each site is geo-positioned with a precision <0.5 m.
Twenty ﬁve individual core samples were collected from the top-
soil (0–30 cm) using a stratiﬁed random sampling design within a
20 m× 20 m area. Core samples were bulked to obtain a compos-
ite sample for each site. Soil samples were air-dried and sieved to
2 mm before analysis. For this study 120 soil samples correspond-
ing to the Burgundy region (four departments Côte d’Or, Saône
et Loire, Yonne, and Nièvre) were analysed.

BOVINE FECES SAMPLING
From April 2009 to June 2009, a total of 271 fecal swabs of cat-
tle were collected from 182 farms located in three departments
of the Burgundy region, namely Côte d’Or, Nièvre, and Saône et
Loire. Three groups of animals were sampled: (i) healthy adults
(218), (ii) enteritic diseased calves (35), and healthy adults linked
with sick calves (18). Swabs (COPAN, CML, France) were imme-
diately transferred into tubes containing Amies agar gel transport
medium. Bacteriological analyses of the fecal swabs were per-
formed within 3 days after sampling. In farm 2 where positive
animals had been detected in 2009, feces samples of the whole cow
herd were analyzed (90 animals) in July 2010 as described above.

FARM ENVIRONMENT SAMPLING
For three farms (farms 1, 2 and 3), where CTX-M producing E.
coli occurred in animals, we conducted further analysis of several
environmental samples during the autumn 2009. These farms were
chosen on the basis of the willingness of the farmers to cooperate
to the study. In each farm one cropped and one pasture soils were
sampled by taking three individual cores in the top soil (using a
7 cm width disinfected auger) that were pooled to obtain a com-
posite sample. Manure samples were collected in the three farms
using the same equipment (disinfected auger). All samples were
kept moist in single use plastic bags at room temperature. Bacte-
riological analyses were performed on these samples within 3 days
after sampling.

SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITY DNA EXTRACTION
Microbial DNA was extracted from bulk RMQS soil samples
according to the method described by Ranjard et al. (2003). Brieﬂy,
1.5 g of each soil was mixed with 5 ml of a solution contain-
ing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 100 mM
NaCl, and 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate. Two grams of
106 µm diameter glass beads and eight glass beads of 2-mm
diameter were added in a bead-beater tube. The samples were
then homogenized for 30 s at 1,600 rpm in a mini bead-beater
cell disruptor (Mikrodismembrator; S.B. Braun Biotech Inter-
national) and centrifuged at 7,000× g for 5 min at 4˚C after
30 min incubation at 70˚C. The collected supernatants were incu-
bated for 10 min on ice after adding 1/10 volume of 3 M potas-
sium acetate (pH 5.5) and centrifuged at 14,000× g for 5 min.
After precipitation with one volume of ice-cold isopropanol, the
nucleic acids were washed with 70% ethanol. DNA extracts were
puriﬁed on polyvinyl polypyrrolydone minicolumns (Bio-Rad,
France) by centrifugation at 1,000× g for 2 min at 10˚C. Resid-
ual impurities from DNA extracts were ﬁnally removed by using a

Geneclean Turbo kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Q
Biogene®, Illkirch, France). DNA’s were quantiﬁed by agarose
gel electrophoresis (1% agarose in TBE buffer) using calf thy-
mus DNA dilutions as standards and the ImageQuant software
(Applied Biosytems). Five nanograms of DNA were used per PCR
reaction.

DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF A REAL-TIME PCR ASSAY FOR blaCTX-M
DETECTION FROM SOIL EXTRACTED DNA
Twenty seven blaCTX-M genes sequences were aligned using
the ClustalW program. Sequences were chosen to be repre-
sentative from the ﬁve distinct groups of CTX-M enzymes
described by Bonnet (2004). Seven sequences from CTX-M-
1 group were used (GenBank accession numbers: DQ658221,
X92506, EU921825, NC004464, Y10278, NC005327,
and
AY238472) corresponding to CTX-M-12, CTX-M-1, CTX-
M-32, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-15, CTX-M-33, respectively. Four
sequences from CTX-M-9 group (GenBank accession num-
bers: AF174129, EU916273, EU921824, and EU921826) cor-
responding to CTX-M-9, CTX-M-27, CTX-M-24, and CTX-
M-65, respectively. Three sequences from CTX-M-2 group
were used (GenBank accession numbers: X92504, EF374097,
and AM982521) corresponding to CTX-M-2, CTX-M-56, and
CTX-M-77 respectively. Three sequences
from CTX-M-25
group were used (GenBank accession numbers: AF518567,
DQ023162, and AM982522) corresponding to CTX-M-25,
CTX-M-41, and CTX-M-78 respectively. Two sequences from
CTX-M-8 group were used (GenBank accession number:
AF189721 and AY750914) corresponding to CTX-M-8 and
CTX-M-40. From these alignments, primers and Taqman
type probes
speciﬁc for either blaCTX-M genes encoding
CTX-M-1 or CTX-M-9 groups were selected using Primer
Express software (Applied Biosystems). For CTX-M-1 group,
primers were F469 (5

system (Applied Biosystems, France) and Absolute QPCR ROX
master mix (Thermo Scientiﬁc, France) in 25-µl reaction mix-
tures and under reaction conditions of 95˚C for 15 min (enzyme
activation), and 40 two-step cycles consisting of 95˚C for 15 s and
60˚C for 1 min. Primers concentrations were 400 nM and Taq-
man type probe concentration was 200 nM, 1-µl of T4 GP32
(MP Biomedicals, France) was added per reaction. Five micro-
liters of template DNA was added per reaction. PCR targets
were cloned in pCR II-TOPO plasmid and recombinant lin-
earized plasmids were used as standards. Gene copy numbers
were calculated by amplifying six serial dilutions of the stan-
dard (101–105 copies per reaction mixture) in parallel with the
samples. The speciﬁcity of the CTX-M detection systems has
been checked in silico using the BlastN algorithm across the
GenBank nucleotide database (NCBI website). The speciﬁcity
of the CTX-M detection systems has also been validated by

of the isolates and the production of ESBL was assessed by
the double-disk synergy test (Jarlier et al., 1988). Guidelines
for the interpretation of antibiotic susceptibility testing were
from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI,
2010).

IDENTIFICATION OF ESBL TYPES
The characterization of the bla gene was performed by PCR on
isolates with a positive double-disk synergy test by using primers
speciﬁc for the genes encoding ESBL from TEM, SHV, and CTX-M
families (Chanal et al., 1992; Neuwirth et al., 1995; Sabate et al.,
2002). PCR products were sequenced on both strands using ABI
PRISM 3100 (Applied Biosystems, France).

GENOTYPING BY THE DIVERSILAB SYSTEM (BIOMÉRIEUX)
The Diversilab system is a typing technique which is based on
the repetitive-sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) and proved to be
a useful method for genotyping of E. coli (Fluit et al., 2010).
All reagents, automates and software used for this study were
provided by bioMérieux, France. DNA was extracted from E.
coli colonies using an UltraClean Microbial DNA isolation kit
and following the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted
DNA was ampliﬁed using a DiversiLab Escherichia DNA ﬁnger-
printing kit. Electrophoresis of the ampliﬁed fragments using
a microﬂuidics LabChip with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and
analysis were performed according to the protocol of the man-
ufacturer. Isolates with a similarity of <95% were considered
different, and isolates with a similarity of >98% were considered
indistinguishable.

using human clinical isolates harboring known blaCTX-M genes
(Table 1). In order to determine the efﬁciency of these detec-
tion systems in soil, soil samples (2 g ) were spiked with known
titers of E. coli strain EC 913 SE carrying blaCTX-M-1, soil DNA
was extracted immediately as described above and subjected to
real-time PCR using the primers and probe speciﬁc for CTX-M-1
group (Figure 1).

BACTERIOLOGICAL METHODS AND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE TESTING
All fecal samples from the cows and all environmental samples have
been inoculated on ESBL screening agar plates containing Drigal-
sky medium supplemented with either cefotaxime (4 mg/l) or cef-
tazidime (4 mg/l). The antibiotic susceptibility testings have been
performed by the disk diffusion method. A range of antibiotics
including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenem (imipenem),
aminoglycosides (kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamycin, strep-
tomycin, amikacin, netilmicin), chloramphenicol, quinolones
(ciproﬂoxacin, oﬂoxacin), doxycycline, cotrimoxazol, and col-
istin was used to determine antibiotic susceptibility patterns

MLST TYPING OF E. COLI STRAINS
MLST typing of E. coli strains was done according to recommen-
dations found at http://mlst.ucc.ie/mlst/dbs/Ecoli/documents/
primersColi_html. The E. coli MLST scheme uses internal frag-
ments of the following seven house-keeping genes: adk (adenylate
kinase), fumC (fumarate hydratase), gyrB (DNA gyrase), icd (isoc-
itrate/isopropylmalate dehydrogenase), mdh (malate dehydroge-
nase), purA (adenylosuccinate dehydrogenase), recA (ATP/GTP
binding motif). MLST typing was done at the Institute of Micro-
biology and Epizootics, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany,
by Dr. Sebastian Guenther.

CTX-M-producing E. coli from soil and cattle

RESULTS
blaCTX-M DETECTION IN SOILS
The method of real-time PCR detection of blaCTX-M has been val-
idated on the basis of ampliﬁcation of DNA from pure strains or
from inoculated soil DNA. The two detection systems proved to
be sensitive and speciﬁc of blaCTX-M genes encoding group 1 and
group 9 enzymes. Detection threshold was estimated to be one
copy per PCR reaction. Detection limit in soil samples was esti-
mated to be 103 copies per gram of soil (Figure 1). Out of the 120
soil extracted DNA’s from Burgundy, 22 were found to be positive
using one or two detection systems (Figure 2). The proportion
of positive soil for occurrence of blaCTX-M 1 or 9 was of 3.3% in
Yonne, 6.2% in Côte d’Or, 16.0% in Nièvre, and 24.2% in Saône
et Loire. These results demonstrate the wide distribution of some
blaCTX-M genes in soils from Burgundy. No obvious correlation
was found between soil physical and chemical properties and the
occurrence of blaCTX-M genes [analysis by principal component
analysis (PCA), data not shown]. The causes of the higher preva-
lence of blaCTX-M genes in soils from Saône et Loire remain to be
deciphered.

DETECTION OF ESBL-PRODUCING E. COLI FROM LIVESTOCK
Out of the 271 feces samples analyzed in 2009, 13 proved to
contain ESBL-producing E. coli (Table 2). Five isolates harbored
the TEM-71-ESBL. Interestingly all these isolates were originated
from “Nièvre.” Four isolates were genotypically indistinguishable.
Among them isolates 32 and 101 were originated from two farms

detected (colored squares) in the four departments of Burgundy (21:
Côte d’Or, 58: Nièvre, 89:Yonne, and 71: Saône et Loire). Red square:

located in the same village. The others (92 and 107) were recovered
in animals from farms located 16 km apart. The eight remain-
ing isolates harbored CTX-M-1. The CTX-M-1 producing isolates
have been isolated in three departments (Nièvre, Saône et Loire,
and Côte d’Or). The genotypical analysis performed by rep-PCR
with Diversilab revealed a wide diversity among the strains isolated
from different farms. However, the strains 234 and 235 originated
from two animals sampled in a same farm (farm 2) were clonally
related (not distinguishable).

One year later (July 2010), feces samples of the whole cow herd
from farm 2 were analyzed (90 animals), and CTX-M-1 producing
E.coli isolates were detected from two animals. Strains V71 and V9
were genotyped and were different from the strains 234 and 235
isolated in June 2009 (Table 2).

DETECTION OF ESBL E. COLI ISOLATES IN ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES
The environments of three farms where positive animals have been
detected were chosen for further investigations. In the farm 1, no
ESBL-producing E. coli were found in the farm environment. On
the contrary, 4 and 6 CTX-M-1 producing E. coli were detected in
farms 2 and 3 respectively (Table 2). In farm 2, a cultivated soil
amended one year before with liquid cow manure from the farm
was found to contain CTX-M harboring E. coli strains. These iso-
lates were genotypically indistinguishable from the animal strains
F2/CO/234 and F2/CO/235. Interestingly the soil sampling site
was located 3 km away from the cattle barn. In farm 3 the pos-
itive samples were: pasture soil, and composted manure. In that
case, composted manure isolate was identical to the animal isolate,
whereas one soil isolate had a different genotype.

DISCUSSION
The worldwide emergence of CTX-M producing E. coli in human
clinical samples is a public health concern (Pitout and Laup-
land, 2008) and raises several interrogations regarding their high
dissemination rate. These strains are also widely described in
animals (pets, farm animals; Costa et al., 2009; Bortolaia et al.,
2010; Cortes et al., 2010). It can be hypothesized that there is
a cross-transmission between the human being and the animals
(Leverstein-Van Hall et al., 2011), or that there are common envi-
ronmental sources leading to human and animal contaminations.
The treatment regimes for eradication of infections caused by such
strains are sometimes very limited, i.e., when the CTX-M produc-
tion is associated with the production of aminoglycosides modify-
ing enzymes and gyrase mutations (ﬂuoroquinolones resistance).
We report in this study our ﬁndings concerning the prevalence of
fecal carriage of E. coli CTX-M producing in cattle as well as the
contamination of the farm environment.

DETECTION OF ESBL-PRODUCING E. COLI IN LIVESTOCK
We have detected ESBL-producing E. coli in livestock (5% of the
animals tested). In Europe such strains have been only sporadi-
cally described in cattle: in Germany (Guerra et al., 2007), England
(Horton et al., 2011), and Spain (Brinas et al., 2005). To our best
knowledge this is the second report of ESBL-producing E. coli in
cattle in France where Meunier et al. (2006) reported three isolates
(carrying either CTX-M-1 or CTX-M-15 ESBL) responsible for
infections in cow. Our results demonstrate that ESBL-producing E.

coli strain are carried indifferently by sick and healthy animals. Our
results are in agreement with previously reported data: CTX-M-1
is the ESBL which is the most frequently encountered in animals
(Girlich et al., 2007; Bonnedahl et al., 2009; Bortolaia et al., 2010).
Nevertheless we have detected for the ﬁrst time E. coli TEM-
71-producing in ﬁve animals whereas they have been exceptionally
reported in human infection (Wong-Beringer et al., 2001; Rasheed
et al., 2002; De Champs et al., 2004). This ﬁnding is interesting
from the epidemiological point of view because four isolates are
genotypically related whereas they were originated from differ-
ent farms (F4, F6, F7, and F9) This indicates that some clonal
isolates are widespread or might circulate (through animal trans-
fer) at a regional scale or that there is a common reservoir in
the region. At the farm level, this might suggest a potential cross-
contamination among cattle or the presence of a reservoir within
the farm. Finally, this is the ﬁrst description of TEM-71 pro-
ducing E. coli
in animals. It is noteworthy that the TEM-71
producing isolates are multiresistant to ciproﬂoxacin, gentamicin,
chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazol. On the opposite, most of the
CTX-M-1 producing isolates harbor a single associated resistance

to cotrimoxazol (Table 2). Therefore, cefotaxim resistant E. coli
recovered from animals originated from different farms show
signiﬁcantly different antibiotic resistance patterns. This might
reﬂect different exposition of the animals to antimicrobial agents
or different sources of contamination.

In farm 2, strains isolated from cattle in 2010 have a different
genotype compared to those isolated in 2009. Several hypothesis
might explain this result: (i) horizontal gene transfer may occur
between E. coli genotypes carried by cattle, since blaCTX-M genes
are carried by plasmids, (ii) new exogenous E. coli strains may have
been disseminated in the farm environment.

DETECTION OF ESBL-PRODUCING E. COLI IN FARM ENVIRONMENT
Among the 12 farms where ESBL-producing E. coli were detected
from animals, we chose three farms to further investigate the dis-
semination of these strains in the farm environment. Farms were
chosen on the basis of which farmers will decide to cooperate to
our study.

In two of the three farms where positive animals were reported,
ESBL E. coli isolates were detected in environmental samples.

CTX-M-producing E. coli from soil and cattle

Interestingly, in farm 2 one of the soil sampling sites was a crop
ﬁeld that has been amended 1 year before (autumn 2008) with liq-
uid manure collected in the barn. This crop ﬁeld was located 3 km
away from the cattle barn. In autumn 2009, we were able to isolate
several CTX-M producing E. coli strains from this soil, indicating
that such strains have the ability to survive at least 1 year after soil
amendment under environmental conditions. In farm 3, the pos-
itive samples were: pasture soil, and composted manure. In that
case, composted manure isolate was identical to the animal isolate,
whereas one soil isolate had a different genotype.

FURTHER GENOTYPIC COMPARISON OF E. COLI STRAINS
MLST typing of E. coli strains isolated from this study has been
partially done. Preliminary results indicate that some E. coli strains
isolated from animal and soil belong to previously described ST58,
ST155, and ST178 as deﬁned in the MLST database hosted at
UCC2. Four strains appear to belong to new genotypes namely
ST2497, ST2498, and ST2499. blaCTX-M-1 genes were found in E.
coli isolates with variable ST. ST8 and ST155 grouped strains from
animal and human origin, some strains belonging to these ST are
pathogenic for human or animals. Plasmids of four strains were
sequenced (454 pyrosequencing), blaCTX-M genes were found on
plasmids and located close to one copy of ISEcp1 in each strain
(data not shown).

MOLECULAR DETECTION OF blaCTX-M GENES IN SOILS FROM
BURGUNDY
The origin of the blaCTX-M genes detected in soils remains to be
elucidated, several hypotheses might be investigated. E. coli strains

2http://mlst.ucc.ie/mlst/dbs/Ecoli/GetTableInfo_html

harboring blaCTX-M genes might have been disseminated in soils
through manure application on cultivated soils (animal origin),
sewage sludge application (human origin), or through irrigation
with treated or untreated waste-water. As the progenitor blaCTX-M
gene is the chromosomal bla genes of different species of Kluyvera
(Decousser et al., 2001; Poirel et al., 2002) we can also hypothesize
that bla genes detected in the studied soils might be harbored by
bacterial species other than E. coli. These bacteria might thus act as
potential environmental bla genes reservoirs. To our best knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst report about occurrence of blaCTX-M genes
in soil.

The detection of CTX-M producing E. coli in soil was the
major ﬁnding of this study. Our work demonstrated the sur-
vival of CTX-M producing E. coli in soil at least for one year.
Future work will aim at linking blaCTX-M occurrence with the
capacity of E. coli strains to survive under environmental condi-
tions. Finally, potential risks for public health through water or
vegetables contamination will have to be determined.
