Abstract: Streptococci, enterococci and Streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic agents of infective endocarditis 
and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. Viridans streptococci (VS) not seldomly cause contamina-
tion of blood cultures. Vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were applied in order to compare the results 
of both methods.  

Strains  originated  from  two  groups  of  patients:  149  strains  from  patients  with  infective  endocarditis  and  181  strains  as-
sessed as blood culture contaminants. Of the 330 strains, based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) 
were VS strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal  strains, 54 (16%) were E. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains be-
longed to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci. Among VS strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) 
and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the 
same VS group. Non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred  among strains in  the contaminant group, while for 
endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed. 

Only 67 of 150 strains  in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. Most VS 
strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two 
methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. Pyogenic strains (n=10), Enterococcus faecalis strains 
(n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both meth-
ods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

INTRODUCTION 

  Viridans  streptococci  (VS),  enterococci  and  Streptococ-
cus-like  bacteria  are  frequent  etiologic  agents  of  infective 
endocarditis  and  correct  species  identification  can  be  a  big 
laboratory  challenge  [1].  Diagnostic  tools  for  identification 
of  bacteria  have  developed  dramatically  in  the  last  decades. 
These  techniques, especially sequencing of the genes coding 
for rRNA and other genes, have led to revolutionary insights 
into the phylogeny and taxonomy of streptococci and related 
taxons  [2].  Accurate  identification  of  ß-hemolytic  or  pyo-
genic  streptococci  is  to  a  large  extent  done  by  phenotypic 
reactions,  whereas  newer  molecular  techniques  including 
sequencing  of  genes  are  more  and  more  often  used  for  their 
typing  [2].  Accurate  identification  of  strains  belonging  to 
viridans  streptococci  is  prerequisite  for  understanding  the 
pathogenesis  of  these  opportunistic  infections,  especially 
with regards to infective endocarditis [3].  

  The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 65 validly 
published  species,  and  the  taxonomic  classification  of  these

members  is  not  well  defined,  but  they  are  divided  into:  the 
pyogenic  group  and  the  VS,  which  are  grouped  into  1)  the 
anginosus  group,  formerly  called  “  S.  milleri”,  2)  the  mitis 
group,  3)  the  salivarius  group,  4)  the  mutans  group,  5)  the 
bovis  group  and  6)  other  undifferentiated  streptococci  [4]. 
Knowledge  on  identification  and  relationship  among  VS 
strains increases as well by use of phenotypic and molecular 
methods. The Vitek 2 system seems to represent an accurate 
and acceptable mean for performing characterization/  identi-
fication  of  many  bacterial  species  [5];  however,  identifica-
tion of VS strains seems challenging also for this system [6]. 
Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is widely used in identifi-
cation of bacteria and has revolutionized  taxonomy over the 
last  decades,  though  the  discriminative  power  may  call  for 
additional  molecular  examinations  when  trying  to  separate 
VS strains and other closely related bacteria from each other 
[6,  7].  However,  phylogenetic  analysis  based  on  16S  rRNA 
gene sequences of type strains of VS reveal a clustering pat-
tern  that  reflect  their  pathogenic  potential  and  ecological 
preferences [8].  

  We  therefore  found  it  interesting  to  characterize  a  large 
collection of VS strains obtained from blood cultures from a

well  defined  group  of  infective  endocarditis  patients  and  a 
second  group  of  strains  from  blood  cultures  assumed  to  be 
contaminants. Vitek 2 examination and partial sequencing of 
the  16S  rRNA  gene  (a  526  basepair  stretch)  and  subsequent 
BLAST  examination  were  applied  in  order  to  compare  and 
describe the methods and groups of strains, respectively.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 

Bacterial Strains 

  All  strains  of  streptococci,  Streptococcus-like  bacteria, 
and  Enterococcus  faecalis  (it  was  the  only  Enterococcus 
species  which  had  been  isolated  from  endocarditis  patients) 
isolated at the Department of Clinical Microbiology at Herlev 
University  Hospital  in  the  period  of  January  1st.  2002-31  st. 
December  2006,  from  patients  with  definite  infective  endo-
carditis  according  to  the  modified  Duke  criteria  [9]  were 
included.  In  addition,  VS  strains  from  the  same  period, 
which  were  evaluated  as  blood  culture  contaminants,  were 
included. Criteria for blood culture contamination were, if 1) 
only one or two of four blood culture bottles yielded growth 
within  a  given  blood  culture  set  and  temperature,  leuco-
cyte(s) count(s) and C-reactive protein values of the patients 
were  all  within  normal  ranges,  or  2)  in  the  presence  of  an-
other significant infection other than endocarditis with VS or 
another  bacterial  infection.  All  data  were  extracted  from  the 
laboratory  information  system  (LIS)  (AdBakt,  Autonik, 
Sweden).  Streptococcal  isolates  judged  as  contaminations 
were  initially  seldom  attempted  identified  to  the  species 
level.  All  bacterial  strains,  including  streptococcal  isolates 
judged  as  contaminations  were  kept  frozen  at  (-80ºC).  The 
strains  were  taken  from  frozen,  inoculated  on  5%  Danish 
Blood  Agar  and  incubated  at  35º  C  in  ambient  atmosphere 
supplemented with 5% CO2. 

Phenotypic Identification 

  The Vitek 2 (BioMeriux)  is  an automated system for the 
species  identification  of  bacteria  [10].  After  6-8  hours  of 
incubation, reactions were read automatically. A colorimetric 
GP card for the identification of Gram-positive cocci with 43 
reactions [6] was used for identification of all isolates. When 
supplementary  tests  were  recommended  by  the  system,  they 
were done, except for (cid:1)-N-Acetyl-Galactosaminidase. 

Partial 16S rRNA Gene Sequence Analysis 

 
Partial  16S  rRNA  gene  sequencing  and  subsequent 
BLAST examination was performed as described previously 
[7].  Briefly,  DNA  was  released  by  heating  isolated  bacteria 
at  95°C  for  5  min.  PCR  amplification  of  part  of  the  16S 
rRNA gene (526 base pairs stretch) was performed using the 
primers  BSF-8  and  BSR-534.  All  edited  sequences  were 
compared  to  deposited  sequences  in  the  GeneBank  with  a 
standard nucleotide- nucleotide BLAST approach (see Table 1). 
Blast files were stored electronically and later evaluated.  

RESULTS 

 
In total 330 strains were  included; 149 strains were from 
patients  with  definite  infective  endocarditis,  and  181  strains 
from  the  same  period,  which  had  been  evaluated  as  blood 
culture  contaminants.  Of  the  330  strains,  based  on  partial 
16S rRNA gene sequencing results, 251 were VS strains, 10 

were  pyogenic  streptococcal  strains,  54  were  E.  faecalis 
strains  and  15  strains  belonged  to  a  miscellaneous  group  of 
catalase-negative Gram-positive cocci.  

 
In  Table  1  results  obtained  by  the  two  methods  for  VS 
strains  with  respect  to  allocation  to  the  same  VS  groups  are 
given.  Of  the  251  VS  strains,  220  (87,6%)  and  31  (12,3%), 
respectively,  obtained  agreeing  and  non-agreeing  results  on 
the  group  level.  Within  the  mitis  group  of  VS,  150  strains 
agreeingly  were  allocated  to  the  same  group,  of  which  89 
strains  achieved  confirmed  level  by  partial  16S  rRNA  gene 
sequence analysis with a range of Maxscore differences from 
10  to  138  to  the  next  best  taxon  match;  most  of  the  strains 
achieved  excellent  level  of  identification  in  the  Vitek  2  sys-
tem.  Twenty  of  the  31  strains  with  non-agreeing  results  at 
the group level belonged to the mitis group of VS, judged by 
16S rRNA gene  sequence  analysis.  For the other VS groups 
mostly agreeing results were obtained. 

  Among  the  220  VS  strains  allocated  to  the  same  VS 
group by both methods, non-agreeing species  identifications 
mostly  occurred  among  strains  in  the  contaminant  group 
(mitis group 66 / 83, salivarius group 3 / 4, bovis group 5 / 8, 
other streptococci 2 / 2 strains), while for endocarditis strains 
notably  fewer  disagreeing  results  were  noticed  (mitis  group 
17 / 83, salivarius group 1 / 4, bovis group 3 / 8). In Table 2a 
(n=  122)  and  2b  (n=98),  data  are  given  for  strains  obtaining 
and  not  obtaining,  respectively,  allocation  to  the  same  VS 
species by both methods. Only 67 of 150 mitis group strains 
obtained  agreeing  species  identifications  by  both  methods 
(Table 2a).  Most VS strains belonging  to the groups of sali-
varius,  anginosus,  bovis,  and  mutans  obtained  agreeing  spe-
cies  identifications  with  the  two  methods,  while  this  only 
was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. Strains belonging 
to  species  in  the  mitis  group  had  the  highest  number  of  dis-
agreeing  results  being  for  55,3%  of  strains  (n  =  83  /150) 
(Table 2b); respectively, 59, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1 and 1 strain(s) 
of  the  following  species  (when  taking  starting  point  in  the 
partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis results): S. mitis, S. 
sanguinis, S. infantis, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oralis, 
S. pneumoniae, S.gordonii and S.  sinensis). Among the non-
agreeing  S.  mitis  strains,  25  of  59  strains  obtained  species 
confirming results (score bits difference 10  to 98) by partial 
16S rRNA gene sequencing/BLAST examination.  

  All  ten  pyogenic  streptococcal  strains  achieved  agreeing 
results by the two methods. Five strains had a Maxscore dif-
ference  between  best  and  next  best  taxon  match  of  82-107 
and  5  strains  a  difference  of  0-25;  by  Vitek  2  8,  1  and  1 
strain(s),  respectively,  were  recorded  as  Excellent  (Exc), 
Very Good (VG) and Low Discrimination (LD) level  identi-
fications.  The  following  haemolytic  species  were  identified: 
S agalactiae (n = 4), S. dysgalactiae. ssp. equisimilis (n = 4), 
S. pyogenes (n = 1), and S. equi ssp.  zooepidemicus (n = 1). 
All 54 E. faecalis strains had  Maxscore differences between 
best  and  next  best  taxon  match  of  121-171  with  excellent 
identifications by Vitek 2.  

In  the  miscellaneous  group  of  strains  (n=15)  agreeing 
 
genus  identifications  were  obtained  for  9  strains  of  which  7 
strains  obtained  confirmed  partial  16S  rRNA  gene  sequenc-
ing identifications (range of Maxscore difference: 12-85) and 
2  possible  identifications  [Granulicatella  species  strains 
(n=2)  with  Maxscore  differences  of  5].  The  9  strains  be-
longed to the following genera: Globicatella (n=3), Granuli-

endocarditis as well as from patients without infective endo-
carditis,  where  blood-culture  contamination  was  suspected. 
Notably,  among  VS  strains  allocated  to  the  same  VS  group, 
most  disagreeing  results,  with  respect  to  allocation  to  the 
same  VS  species,  occurred  among  assumed  contaminant 
strains. These findings are in agreement with the findings by 
Haanperä et  al.  [6],  who  used  a  pyrosequencing  method  for 
the identification of streptococcal species based on two vari-
able  regions  of  the  16S  rRNA  gene.  Identification  of  mem-
bers  of  the S.  mitis  and  S.  sanguinis  groups  proved  difficult  

for both the pyrosequencing method and the Vitek 2 system. 
Furthermore,  the  pyrosequencing  analysis  revealed  great 
sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of 133 strains ana-
lyzed  by  pyrosequencing  had  sequences  identical  to  a  type 
strain.  The  variation  was  highest  in  the  pharyngeal  strains, 
slightly  lower  in  the  blood  culture  strains,  and  nonexistent 
among invasive pneumococcal  isolates (n = 17),  that all had 
the Streptococcus pneumoniae type strain sequence. Whether 
this  reflects  a  difference  among  disease  provoking  and  con-
taminating VS strains seems worth to explore in more detail.

Infective Endocarditis: Identification of vs Strains 

The Open Microbiology Journal, 2010, Volume 4    121 

 
  VS  groups  may  often  be  separated  from  other  groups  of 
Gram-positive  cocci  and  from  each  other  on  basic  pheno-
typic  reactions  [2,  11,  12].  They  are  alpha-  or  gamma-
hemolytic,  form  chains,  are  catalase  negative,  produces 
leucine  aminopeptidase,  but  are  without  pyrrolidonyl  amin-
opeptidase  activity.  For  VS  group  identification,  results  ob-
tained  for  arginine  decarboxylase  production,  esculin  hy-
drolysis,  Voges-Proskauer  reaction,  urease  production  and 
acid production from mannitol and sorbitol are of great help. 
Especially  the  high  no.  of  strains  from  the  mitis  group  spe-
cies  can  be  problematic  [12].  Identification  to  the  species 
level  therefore  in  all  times  has  been  a  challenge.  Many  at-
tempts  to solve species  identification within VS strains have 
been  made  over  time,  including  kit-based  systems.  Funke 
and  Funke-Kissling  [13]  was  the  first  to  publish  an  evalua-
tion of the new Vitek 2 colorimetric GP card and found all of 
the 18 alpha-hemolytic streptococcal species examined to be 
correctly  identified.  Haanperä et al. [6] used a pyrosequenc-
ing  method  (see  above).  Almost  all  studied  streptococcal 
species  (n  =  51)  represented  by  their  type  strains  were 
differentiated,  except  some  closely  related  species  of  the  S. 
bovis or S. salivarius group. Pyrosequencing results of alpha-
hemolytic  strains  from  blood  (n  =  99)  or  from  the  normal 
pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results 
obtained  by  the  Vitek  2  with  the  colorimetric  GP  card.  The 
results  of  the  two  methods  did  not  completely  agree,  but  93 
(75.0%) of the isolates were assigned to the same streptococ-
cal  group  by  both  methods  and  57  (46.0%)  reached  consis-
tent  results  at  the  species  level.  These  data  are  in  line  with 
our  findings,  that  among  VS  strains,  respectively,  220 
(87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing 
identifications  with  the  two  methods  with  respect  to  alloca-
tion  to  the  same  VS  group  and  of  strains  allocated  to  the 
same  VS  group,  55,5  %  (122  of  220  strains)  were  allocated 
to identical species by the two methods. These obtained data, 
however,  covers  a  continuum of  certainty, as searched  illus-
trated  by  dividing  molecular  data  into  confirmed,  probable 
and  possible.  Though  most  strains  typically  are  given  in  the 
confirmed column, the identification challenges within espe-
cially the mitis group is clearly illustrated by the great no. of 
strains  given  in  the  probable  and  possible  columns.  Like-
wise,  the  spread  in  identification  level  obtained  by  Vitek  2 
illustrates  this  uncertainty.  In  the  work  by  Haanperä  et  al. 
[6],  10  strains  remained  unidentified  by  Vitek  2,  and  4 
strains  could  not  be  assigned  to  any  streptococcal  group  by 
pyrosequencing. Most of discrepant results were found in the 
mitis  and  sanguinis  groups,  being  in  agreement  with  our  re-
sults.  Inclusion  of  tests  for  acid  production  from  inulin  and 
production  of  dextran  will  probably  be  able  to  contribute 
significantly to discrimination within the mitis group. For the 
other  frequently  encountered  VS  groups,  the  anginosus 
groups,  salivarius  and  bovis  groups,  there  seems  to  be  less 
discriminatory  problems  with  the  tests  included  in  the  
system.  

strated a high degree of variability for all three targets, which 
was  not  found  a  surprising  observation  since  transfer  of  ge-
netic  material  among  streptococci  has  been  well  described 
[8, 14, 15]. In their study, classifications within groups were 
not  always  predictable  or  correlated  with  phenotype  or 
phylogeny;  an  observation  also  noted  by  Hoshino  et  al.  for 
isolates  from  patients  with  bacteremia  and  meningitis  [4]. 
Kilian  et  al.  [8]  have  looked  at  the  evolution  of S.  pneumo-
niae and its close commensal relatives. A population genetic 
analysis of 118 strains tentatively assigned to S. pneumoniae, 
S.  mitis,  S.  oralis,  and  S.  infantis,  aligning  the  sequences  of 
the four housekeeping genes, ddl, gdh, rpoB, and sodA, plus 
eight  sets  of  sequences  extracted  from  S.  pneumoniae  ge-
nomes  revealed,  a  remarkable  sequence  polymorphism  and 
that  S.  pneumoniae  is  one  of  several  hundred  evolutionary 
lineages  forming  a  cluster  separate  from S.  oralis  and  S.  in-
fantis.  The  remaining  lineages  of  this  distinct  cluster  are  S. 
mitis strains (commensals). 

  Also  rnpB,  sodA,  and/or  16S-23S  rRNA  spacer  targets 
have been used for characterization of strains illustrating the 
mentioned  complexity  [16-18].  For  daily  routine  characteri-
zation  and  identification  of  VS  the  use  of  a  combination  of 
sequence  analysis  of  the  ITS  region  and  of  the  partial  gdh 
gene have proven promising [19]. 

 
For practical use, pyogenic streptococci are characterized 
by  phenotypic  and  serological  characteristics  [2].  However, 
if reactions are found inconclusive, Vitek 2 can be very help-
ful or sequencing parts of the 16S rRNA gene.  

  All  54  E.  faecalis  strains  seemed  well  identified  by  both 
methods.  

  The  Streptococcus-like  bacteria  (Globicatella,  Granuli-
catella, Gemella, Facklamia and Aerococcus species) identi-
fied  in  our  study,  are  rare  but  well  described  aetiologies  of 
infective  endocarditis  [11,  20-28].  Most  are  well  character-
ized  by  molecular  methods  [11,  21,  23,  29-32],  but  hardly 
included  in  the  databases  used  for  kit-based/automated  
phenotypic  identification  systems.  Therefore,  phenotypic 
characterization  not  seldomly 
laboratory  
challenge. 

is  a  major 

CONCLUSION 

 
In  conclusion,  the  present  study  shows  the  usefulness  of 
the  Vitek  2  GP  card  and  partial  16S  rRNA  gene  sequence 
analysis  for  identification  of  VS  strains  to  the  group  level, 
but  also  the  problems  occurring  when  searching  to  reach  a 
species  identification,  which  seems  most  problematic  with 
the  mitis  group  of  species.  Interestingly,  among  VS  strains 
non-agreeing  species  identification  mostly  occurred  among 
strains  in  the  contaminant  group,  while  for  endocarditis 
strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.

For correct molecular species identification of VS strains, 
sequencing  of  other  genes  or  application  of  other  methods 
therefore seems desirable. Simmons et al. [14] examined 94 
VS  strains  from  94  patients  with  definite  endocarditis  to 
evaluate  the  phylogenetic  relationships  of  VS  with  16S 
rRNA,  tuf,  and  rpoB  gene  targets.  The  used  16S  rRNA 
primer pairs were 5F  and 534R, which is very similar to the 
bp  stretch  used  in  this  study.  Overall,  VS  isolates  demon-
