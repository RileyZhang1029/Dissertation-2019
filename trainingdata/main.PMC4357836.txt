This unique property is controlled by a complex interplay between transcriptional factors and epigenetic regulators.
Recent research indicates that the epigenetic role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is an integral component of this regulatory network.
This report will summarize ﬁndings that focus on two classes of regulatory ncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), in the induction, maintenance and directed differentiation of ESCs and iPSCs.
Manipulating these two important types of ncRNAs would be crucial to unlock the therapeutic and research potential of pluripotent stem cells.
Introduction  Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the inner cell mass, which possess the potential for unlimited proliferation and dif- ferentiation into three germ layers, are the ideal cell source for cell therapy [1 3].
The acquisition of human ESCs (hESCs), however, requires the destruction of human embryos.
There- fore, possible immunological rejection or religious and ethical concerns greatly hinder the pace of ESCs in basic and clinical applications.

Production and hosting by Elsevier  pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with characteristics similar to those of ESCs by overexpressing four exogenous factors (Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4) in ﬁbroblasts [4].
This method of deriving patient-speciﬁc iPSCs from donor somatic cells re- moves many of these medical, ethical and political obstacles, creates disease-speciﬁc stem cells and provides a platform to study molecular mechanisms of genetic diseases.
Understand- ing how these regulatory processes function in iPSCs would help to accelerate the basic research and clinical applications of iPSCs [5].
ESCs and iPSCs are characterized by their self-renewal and differentiation into any cell type.
Transcription factor net- works and epigenetics (including DNA methylation, histone modiﬁcations and ncRNAs) undergo a tremendous change during this process [6 8].
ncRNAs can be classiﬁed into either housekeeping or regulatory ncRNAs.
Housekeeping ncRNAs are most often constitutively expressed, which include transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs).

lncRNAs originate from intronic, exonic, intergenic, intragenic, promoter regions, 30- and 50-untranslated regions (UTR) and enhancer sequences.
lncRNAs [10].
lncRNAs consists of intergenic ncRNAs, intronic ncRNAs, natural antisense transcripts (NATs), pseudogene transcripts, etc.
Long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) are derived from non-coding DNA sequences between protein-coding genes, whereas intronic lncRNAs are transcribed from within introns of protein-coding genes and NATs are transcribed from the opposite strand of protein-coding sense transcripts [11,12].
Pseudogene transcripts can modulate the expression of their counterpart genes through competing for endogenous RNA (ceRNA) focus on miRNAs and lncRNAs.
[13].
This review will  transcripts  are  into  long  transcribed  miRNAs are hairpin-derived RNAs that are 20 24 nucleo- tides (nt) long.
They act at the RNA level by destabilizing and repressing target RNAs via binding to the 30 UTRs, 50 UTRs and coding sequences of the transcripts [14 17].
Nonetheless, miRNAs can also enhance mRNA translation by binding to the 50 UTRs [18].
Some miRNA genes are distributed as clusters in the genome and thus these closely distributed miRNAs are termed as the miRNA cluster.
miRNA-coding genes primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II in the nucleus, and then the Drosha-DiGeorge critical region-8 (DGCR8) com- plex processed pri-miRNAs into precursors (pre-miRNAs) of 60 70 nt in length.
Drosha is a member of the ribonuclease III family (RNase III) [19].
Drosha and its cofactor, DGCR8, form a multiprotein complex called Microprocessor to medi- ate the nuclear export.
pre-miRNAs possess a short stem plus a 2-nt 30 overhang (also known as the nuclear cropping step) [20].
After being exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are processed by Dicer (an RNase III enzyme) to produce mature miRNAs, which are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to repress the expression of the target genes or bind directly to DNA preventing transcription [21 24].
(mRNAs).
to messenger RNAs  In contrast to miRNAs, some lncRNAs are remarkably similar lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, capped, spliced and get polyadenylated like mRNAs, although they cannot act as tem- plates for protein synthesis [25].
lncRNAs are able to activate or repress gene expression at multiple levels through diverse mechanisms.
For example, lncRNAs can recruit repressive (e.g., PRC2) and activating (e.g., the Trithorax group) chro- matin modiﬁers at the DNA level much like molecular scaf- folds, leading to regulation of target gene expression [26 29].
At the RNA level, lncRNAs play a role in post-transcriptional events during gene expression and contribute to splicing, mRNA translation and mRNA degradation [30 33].
In addi- tion, certain lncRNAs can inhibit miRNA function, which indirectly enhances protein expression of miRNA targets [34].
Along with the growing understanding of the signiﬁcance of ncRNAs in mammalian cell differentiation and human dis- eases [35,36], accumulating examples are being identiﬁed that illustrate the speciﬁc importance of short and long ncRNAs in PSCs.
In this review, we focus on the recent advances in our understanding of miRNAs and lncRNAs, in the induction, maintenance and differentiation of PSCs.
ESC-speciﬁc miRNA family  Numerous studies identiﬁed a set of ESC-speciﬁc miRNAs that were preferentially expressed in ESCs and downregulated during differentiation into embryoid bodies [37,38].
The expression signature of ESCs has been characterized (Table 1 and Figure 1).
The requirement of miRNAs in ESC self-renew- al and differentiation was demonstrated by ESCs lacking the miRNA-processing enzymes, Dicer or DGCR8.
Dicer- or Dgcr8-null ESCs exhibited reduced cell proliferation due to G1 cell cycle arrest and resistance to differentiation through embryoid body formation or retinoic acid induction [39,40].
miRNAs, miR-195 and miR-372 participate in hESC cell cycle control by depleting the two main miRNA processing enzymes, Dicer and Drosha [41].
In addition, two clusters of miRNAs  miR-302 cluster and mouse miR-290-295/human miR-371-373 cluster  were  Table 1 Summary of pluripotency or differentiation associated miRNAs and lncRNAs  Name  Validated targets  Cell type  Function  miR-302a miR-302 miR-302b, miR-372 miR-291b-5p, miR-293 miR-138 miR-145 miR-125, miR-181 Let-7b miR-9 miR-18, let-7 miR-27b miR-375 Panct1-3 lincRNA-RoR Tsix Mistral lncRNA_N1, lncRNA_N3  CyclinD1 NR2F2 TGFBR2, RHOC P65 P53 Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 Cbx7 TLX, CyclinD1 Stathmin Smad2, Acvr1b, Lin28 Pax3 Hnf1b, Sox9 Oct4 P53 PRC2 MLL1 SUZ12, REST  hESCs hESCs hiPSCs mESCs miPSCs hESCs mESCs Neural stem cells hNPCs mESCs Muscle stem cells hESCs mESCs hiPSCs mESCs mESC hESCs  Regulate cell cycle, promote self-renewal Maintain pluripotency Accelerate mesenchymal to epithelial transition Maintain pluripotency and self-renewal Promote reprogramming Induce diﬀerentiation PRC1-mediated diﬀerentiation Reduce proliferation and diﬀerentiation Coordinate proliferation and migration Mesoderm diﬀerentiation Myogenic diﬀerentiation Endoderm diﬀerentiation Maintain pluripotency Promote reprogram X-chromosome inactivation Germ layer diﬀerentiation Neurogenesis  Ref  [42] [43] [57] [46] [63] [77] [78] [79] [81] [71,84] [88] [92] [97] [99] [103] [104] [105]   Jia W et al / Regulatory Non-coding RNAs in Pluripotent Stem Cells  277  Pluripotency  miR-302-367,  miR-290-295,  miR-371-373,  Panct1-3,   lincRNA-RoR  Differentiation   Let-7,miR-145,  miR-125,Tsix  miR-181, Mistral,  lncRNA_N1,   lncRNA_N3    ESCC miRNAs  lin28   Pluripotency  genes  let-7   Pluripotent cells  Yamanaka factors  and/or   Differentiated cells  miR-302-367,   miR-34, miR-200c,  miR-92, miR-141,    miR-138, lincRNA-RoR   Summary of the published interactions between pluripotency and differentiation associated miRNAs and lncRNAs  Figure 1 miRNAs and lncRNAs that are upregulated in pluripotency are indicated in green, miRNAs that are downregulated in pluripotency are in purple, miRNAs and lncRNAs regulating the somatic reprogramming are in blue.

strongly expressed in ESCs.
The miR-302 cluster (containing 8 miRNAs on chromosome 3/4 in human), consists of highly ex- pressed ESC-speciﬁc miRNAs including some of the most commonly studied miRNAs [42].
Pluripotency factors Oct4 and Sox2 can bind to a conserved promoter region of the miR-302 to initiate its expression [42].
miR-302a can inhibit the expression of G1 regulator cyclin D1, which contributes to the increased population of hESCs in S phase and regulating the cell cycle of ESCs, thereby promoting self-renewal and pluripotency [42].
A recent study found that in undifferentiated ESCs, Oct4 and miR-302, directly inhibit the expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group F, member 2 (NR2F2  COUP-TFII) at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, respectively.
As a positive feedback loop, NR2F2 directly inhibits Oct4 expression [43].
The human homolog of the mouse miR-290-295 cluster, which also forms a tight genomic cluster (miR-371-373 clus- ter), is speciﬁcally expressed in hESCs, which is upregulated in several human tumors [44].
A recent study indicated that several Wnt-signaling pathway genes, including Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), TGF-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2), B cell trans- location gene 1 (BTG1), and left right determination factor 1 (LEFTY1), were direct targets of miR-372 and -373 [45].
The expression of the miR-371-373 cluster was transactivated via the Wnt/b-catenin pathway by directly binding b-catenin/ LEF1 to the miR-371-373 promoter.
These ﬁndings elucidate a novel beta-catenin /LEF1 - miR-372 and -373-DKK1 regulatory feedback loop, which likely plays a crucial role in ESC maintenance [45].
Luningschror et al.
reported that overexpression of the NF-kB subunit p65 results in the loss of pluripotency and differentiation of ESCs, as well as the  epithelial to mesenchymal transition [46].
Interestingly, the miR-290 cluster, speciﬁcally miR-291b-5p and miR-293, targets the p65 coding sequence to repress its translation, which may also contribute in pluripotency [46].
to regulatory networks  speciﬁcity [47 49].
The seed sequence of miRNAs is about 6 8 nt in length, which is thought to be the most important feature for miRNA target studies showed that several miRNAs from different clusters including miR-106, miR-302-367 and miR-290 have similar seed se- quences (AAGUGCU) and are all upregulated in ESCs, sug- gesting that they may repress similar pools of mRNAs to maintain the stem cell state [50].
Interestingly, previous  miRNAs function during somatic cell reprogramming  Since the Yamanaka s group claimed that somatic cells can be reprogrammed into iPSCs by expressing four transcription fac- tors Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4 (also known as the Yama- naka factors), scientists have tried different methods to obtain the iPSCs [4,51 55].
Several miRNAs have been shown to increase the efﬁciency of reprogramming when expressed along with a combination of the four or fewer Yamanaka factors [56,57].
For example, MYC can be regulated by the miR-17-92 cluster, and overex- pression of MYC leads to increased levels of miR-92 [58].
miR-92 belongs to the miR-17-92 cluster, which is upregulated in cancer [58].
Studies have shown that there are differences in the miRNA patterns between human iPSCs (hiPSCs) and   278  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 275 283  hESCs, suggesting that ﬁbroblasts may not be induced to a state identical to that of ESCs [59,60].
To better appreciate such differences in the expression pattern of miRNAs, Neveu and his colleagues proﬁled the miRNA expression in different cell types, including hESCs, iPSCs, differentiated cells, cancer cells and glioma biopsies [61].
These researchers identiﬁed two distinct categories of miRNA patterns in pluripotent cells, regardless the reprogrammed cells were derived from somatic or embryonic cells.
The results are surprising, since these two cell categories differ in the status of their p53 network.
The overexpression of miR-92 and miR-141, the p53 regulatory miRNAs, in iPSCs conferred alterations in the miRNA proﬁle [61].
As p53 targets, miR-34 (a, b and c) can cooperate with p21, another target of p53, to restrain somatic reprogramming [62].
Numerous studies reported that as a tumor suppressor, p53 prevents pluripotency during somatic reprogramming [61,62].
In our study, we demonstrated that the ectopic expres- sion of miR-138 dramatically increased the efﬁciency of iPSC formation by targeting the 30 UTR of p53 [63].
Surprisingly, overexpression of the miR-302-367 cluster can directly repro- gram human and mouse somatic cells into a PSC state without exogenous transcription factors, and the reprogramming efﬁ- ciency is greatly increased compared to that induced by the Yamanaka factors [64].
Further study showed that the miR- 302-367 cluster can activate Oct4 gene expression and suppress HDAC2 activity, which may cooperate to reprogram somatic cells to pluripotency [64].
Meanwhile, mature double-stranded miRNAs (combination of miR-200c, miR-302s and miR-369s family) can also reprogram mouse and human cells to a plurip- otent state by using transfection reagents, which may be safer for biomedical research by avoiding the vector-based gene transfer system [65].
Furthermore, other reports conﬁrm that these miRNAs function in part through increasing the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) by targeting at least the TGFBR2 and Ras homolog gene family, member C (RHOC), to enhance repro- gramming [57].
MET occurs during organ development and also at an early stage during the reprogramming of ﬁbroblasts [57,66,67].
Further study revealed that miR-302 signiﬁcantly decreased the activities of amine oxidase ﬂavin-containing do- main protein 2 (AOF2) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1).
In addition, in conjunction with the co-suppression of methyl-speciﬁc proteins (MECP1/2), miR-302 resulted in global genomic DNA demethylation and histone H3 lysine 4(H3K4) modiﬁcation [68].
Modiﬁcation of chromosomal his- tones can either activate or silence genes  in particular, the methylation level of H3K4 is likely to be important for the efﬁ- cient reprogramming of pluripotency genes [69].
One miRNA can have many target genes.
Therefore, the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated gene regulation are partic- ularly complex during the somatic cell reprogramming pro- cess.
The found that various miRNAs can improve or restrain the efﬁciency of induction during somatic cell reprogramming.
However, the mechanism by which genes are targeted by miRNAs remains largely unknown.
studies described above  miRNAs act as suppressors of the pluripotent state  miRNAs are critical for embryonic development and pluripo- tency maintenance and are involved in cell fate decisions as  well.
ESC-speciﬁc miRNAs have been described previously [37,38].
Nonetheless, miRNAs can also promote the differenti- ation of ESCs into the three germ layers  ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.
The let-7 miRNAs are broadly expressed in differentiated tissues and are increased during ES cell differentiation [70,71] (Table 1 and Figure 1).
At the early differentiation stage of ESCs, expression of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and other pluripotency genes are downregulated, which leads to the downregulation of the ES cell-speciﬁc cell cycle-regulating (ESCC) miRNAs and Lin28.
Lin28, an RNA-binding protein, is a posttranscriptional repressor of let-7 miRNA biogenesis [72].
Therefore, the downregulation of Lin28 dramatically in- creases the expression of let-7 miRNAs.
By targeting the 30 UTR of Lin28, let-7 may inhibit the translational initiation of the genes downstream of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and transcrip- tion factor 3 (Tcf3), thereby accelerating the differentiation of ESCs [73,74].
Further study demonstrated that TUT4 is the uridylyl transferase for the let-7 precursor, which adds an oli- gouridine tail to downstream targets of the let-7 miRNAs, blocking the biogenesis of let-7 miRNA at the dicing step [75].
Expression of miR-145 is low in self-renewing hESCs, which is highly upregulated during differentiation [76].
A increased miR-145 expression recent study reported that inhibits hESC self-renewal and induces lineage-restricted differentiation [76].
Furthermore, Xu et al.
demonstrated that endogenous miR-145 binds to the 3  UTR of the pluripotency genes Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4.
Interestingly, as part of a double- negative feedback loop, the miR-145 promoter, is bound and repressed by Oct4 in hESCs [77].
The polycomb group (PcG) contains multiple homologs of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) components including ﬁve orthologs of the Drosophila polycomb protein (Cbx2, Cbx4, Cbx6, Cbx7 and Cbx8), and is critical for ES plu- ripotency and differentiation.
A recent study demonstrated that Cbx7 is the primary polycomb ortholog of the PRC1 com- plexes in ESCs and knockdown of Cbx7 expression in ESCs can induce differentiation and increase expression of lineage- speciﬁc markers [78].
The miR-125 and miR-181 families are regulators of Cbx7, and overexpression of these miRNAs accelerates ESC differentiation [78].
Studying ESCs can help us understand how miRNAs play a role in suppressing the pluripotent gene expression.
However, to clarify the speciﬁc role of microRNA in ESC differentiation, further study is needed.
Role of miRNAs in stem cell lineage determination  The iPSC technology provides an unlimited source of stem cells to promote the clinical applications of cell therapy.
How- ever, one of the biggest challenges to such clinical application is differentiating these pluripotent cells into the ﬁnal functional cells of a speciﬁc organ.
A further understanding of miRNAs demonstrated that the function of different cell types is associ- ated with a unique miRNA expression pattern.
The let-7 family plays an important role in the ectoderm lineage differentiation of ESCs.
Further study demonstrated that the let-7b miRNA regulates neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation by targeting the stem cell regulator TLX and the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 [79].
Expression of mus- ashi 1 (Msi1), an RNA-binding protein, is increased during the   Jia W et al / Regulatory Non-coding RNAs in Pluripotent Stem Cells  279  early neural differentiation of ESCs.
Msi1 can enhance Lin28 localization to the nucleus and block let-7 family member miR-98 in the nuclear cropping step, thus affecting early neu- ral differentiation of ESCs [80].
miR-9, a brain-speciﬁc miR- NA, is expressed in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) that are derived from hESCs.
Further results suggest that miR-9 regulates the proliferation and migration of hNPCs by directly targeting the microtubule-related gene stathmin [81].
The highly expressed miR-371-373 cluster in PSCs has also been reported to play a critical role in human PSC neuro- genic differentiation behavior [82,83].
Another group found that let-7 and miR-18 downregulated Acvr1b and Smad2, respectively, to increase the mesoderm at the expense of endoderm in mouse ESCs (mESCs) [84].
Expression of miR-125b is upregulated in patients with leuke- mia and can regulate hematopoiesis by targeting Lin28 in mouse hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells [85].
Ivey and colleagues demonstrated that miR-1 and miR-133 can reg- ulate mesoderm formation and cardiac muscle differentiation by suppressing the gene expression in desired lineages [86,87].
Pax3, a regulator of skeletal muscle stem cells, is required for the maintenance of muscle cell differentiation.
miR-27b down- regulates the Pax3 protein levels by directly targeting the 30 UTR of Pax3 and accelerates myogenic differentiation in mus- cle stem cells [88].
However, a recent study demonstrated that miR-489 is a quiescence-speciﬁc miRNA in the satellite cell lineage.
The highly expressed miR-489 in quiescent satellite cells decreased quickly during satellite cell activation.
Further results have shown that miR-489 suppresses the oncogene Dek at the posttranscriptional level, which may be associated with the mechanism for maintaining the quiescent state of a stem cell population [89].
miR-24 and miR-10a were upregulated to inhibit endoder- mal differentiation during NaButyrate induction of hESCs [90].
Joglekar et al.
showed that the expression of four islet- speciﬁc miRNAs including miR-7, miR-9, miR-375 and miR- 376 was high during human pancreatic islet development [91].
Overexpression of miR-375 can downregulate the expres- sion of gut-endoderm/pancreatic progenitor-speciﬁc markers, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta(Hnf1b) and Sox9, during endodermal differentiation of hESCs.
These data indicate that miR-375 may regulate hESC differentiation toward pancreatic islet cells [92].
Taken together, as one miRNA can target more than one gene, the role of miRNAs in cell differentiation is not only re- lated to the level of its own expression but also has a close rela- tionship with factors like the differentiation system, cell type and microenvironment.
lncRNAs in ESC pluripotency and somatic cell reprogramming  Recent studies have identiﬁed over 900 so-called lincRNAs in mESCs and hESCs, which potentially control the self-renewal and pluripotency of ESCs [93,94].
Intriguingly, more than 100 lincRNAs (with proximal genomic targets located less than 10 kb genomic distance from a gene to the binding site) in mESCs appear to be directly bound by ESC-speciﬁc transcrip- tion factors, such as Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog [95].
Lipovich s group observed two lincRNAs that are regulated by Oct4 and Nanog and are essential for maintaining pluripotency.
The  inhibition or misexpression of these two lincRNAs leads to dra- matic changes in the expression of Oct4 and Nanog, indicating the involvement of a feedback loop in the regulatory mecha- nism [95].
To further examine the role of lincRNAs in pluripo- tency, Guttman et al.
performed loss-of-function studies on 147 lincRNAs using lentiviral-based shRNAs in mESCs [96].
Of these lincRNAs, 26 showed involvement in the maintenance of pluripotency.
After deleting these lincRNAs, a reduced Na- nog promoter activity was discovered and expression pattern in mESCs was similar to that in the differentiated cell types, sug- gesting that these lincRNAs repress differentiation programs in mESCs.
Another large-scale screen of functional lincRNAs in mESCs was achieved by using RNA interference (RNAi) with transcript localization.
Consequently, three non-coding tran- scripts, Panct1-3, were identiﬁed as modulators of mESC pluri- potency based on reduced Oct4 promoter activity [97].
Recent ﬁndings showed that lincRNA-RoR (regulator of reprogram- ming, formerly called lincRNA-ST8SIA3) shares miRNA response elements with Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog, and that lincRNA-RoR prevents these core transcription factors from miRNA-mediated suppression in self-renewing hESCs [98].
Together, these ﬁndings connect lincRNAs to the regulatory networks that maintain ESC identity.
In addition to maintaining ESC pluripotency, lncRNAs are involved in the generation of iPSCs (Table 1 and Figure 1).
This cellular reprogramming is accompanied by an extensive global remodeling of the epigenome.
The research group, led by Loewer et al., found that the expression proﬁles of lincR- NAs in iPSCs were similar to those in ESCs but not to those in the somatic cells of origin, such as ﬁbroblasts and hemato- poietic stem cells [99].
Further study showed that expression of 10 lincRNAs was elevated in iPSCs compared with ESCs, sug- gesting that their increased expression may promote repro- gramming [99].
Promoter loci of 3 iPSC-enriched lincRNAs, including lincRNA-SFMBT2, lincRNA-VLDLR and lin- cRNA-RoR, are bound by Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog.
In addi- tion, knockdown of Oct4 led to downregulation of these lincRNAs, suggesting that their expression is directly regulated by the key pluripotency transcription factors.
The depletion of lincRNA-RoR resulted in a 2 8-fold decrease in the number of emerging iPSC colonies.
Conversely, overexpression of lin- cRNA-RoR increased the efﬁciency of iPSC colony formation.
Microarray gene expression analysis demonstrated that knock- down of lincRNA-RoR led to p53 upregulation, which induces oxidative stress, DNA damage and cell death, conﬁrming the role of lincRNAs in the induction of pluripotency by promot- ing the survival of iPSCs [99].
lncRNAs are implicated in the differentiation of PSCs  lncRNAs can regulate the differentiation of ESCs as well.
For example, X-inactive speciﬁc transcript (Xist) plays a role in X- chromosome inactivation (XCI) during female ESC differenti- ation.
In placental mammals, XCI randomly inactivates one of the two female X chromosomes to obtain the proper gene dos- age of X-linked genes in females as compared with males [100].
In female ESCs, Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog bind to intron 1 of Xist to suppress its expression, whereas the antagonizing lncRNA Tsix is activated by the pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2, Rex1, c-Myc and Klf4 [101,102].
Upon differentiation,   280  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 275 283  downregulation of the pluripotency factors initiates the expres- sion of Xist, which later recruits chromatin regulators such as PRC2 to mediate XCI [103].
In addition to Xist in the early step of differentiation, certain other lncRNAs play important roles in the later lineage commitment.
Mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) is an epigenetic activator involved in embryonic development and hematopoiesis [104].
Bertani et al.
found that the lncRNA Mistral is able to recruit MLL1 to chromatin and subsequently induce the expression of the homeotic genes Hoxa6 and Hoxa7 during mESC germ layer differentiation [104].
Another study reported an essential role for lncRNAs in neurogenesis.
Cytoplasmic lncRNA_N2 promoted neuro- genesis possibly by maintaining the expression of neurogenic miRNAs, miR-125b and let-7a, since both of them are located within the introns of lncRNA_N2.
Additionally, nuclear lncRNA_N1 and lncRNA_N3 were identiﬁed to physically interact with nuclear factors REST and SUZ12, respectively, suggesting their potential roles in regulating neuronal differen- tiation [105].
Expression of lncRNAs is correlated with the full develop- ment potential of iPSCs.
In most of the iPSC clones, the lncRNA Gtl2, which belongs to the Dlk1 Dio3 imprinted lo- cus, is aberrantly silenced by DNA hypermethylation and his- tone hypoacetylation [106,107].
The Gtl2 gene is maternally expressed and its expression is thought to negatively regulate the expression of paternal Dlk1 gene, which is located within the same gene cluster and gets involved in fetal growth.
In addition, a total of 26 miRNAs all localized to the Dlk1  Dio3 cluster are differentially expressed in non-4n complemen- tation-competent and 4n complementation-competent iPSC lines [106].
The silenced status of this cluster in iPSCs is closely correlated with the developmental failure of these iPSCs.
In contrast, iPSC clones with normal Dlk1 Dio3 cluster expres- sion contributed to high-grade chimaeras and yielded viable all-iPSC mice.
Interestingly, when an iPSC clone with silenced Dlk1 Dio3 was treated with a histone deacetylase inhibitor val- proic acid (VPA), the locus that includes Gtl2 got reactivated, thus recovering the capability of this clone to support full-term development of all-iPSC mice.
Future perspectives  targets  In recent years, the miRNAs and lncRNAs have been emerg- ing as important components of gene regulation and have be- come the new hotspot of current molecular biology.
Somatic cell reprogramming technology renders terminally-differenti- ated cells to revert to a pluripotent state, thus injecting new vitality into the ﬁeld of stem cell research.
Studies have shown that the regulatory interactions between ESC-speciﬁc miRNAs and their in the cell cycle, DNA methylation, mesenchymal to epithelial transition and apoptosis pathways inﬂuence stem cell pluripotency and somatic cell reprogram- ming and differentiation.
A large number of miRNA and lncRNA sequences have been obtained via high-throughput sequencing technologies.
However, the underlying molecular mechanism of ESC differentiation and pluripotency mainte- nance and somatic cell reprogramming still remains elusive.
Better understanding of the new functions and mechanisms of miRNAs and lncRNAs in these processes would be condu- cive to achieving better appreciation of epigenetics and even more extensive impact on life sciences and biomedical research.
