Infection prevention in dentistry is an important topic that has gained more interest in recent years and
guidelines for the prevention of cross-transmission are common practice in many countries. However, little is
known about the real risks of cross-transmission, specifically in the dental healthcare setting. This paper
evaluated the literature to determine the risk of cross-transmission and infection of viruses and bacteria that
are of particular relevance in the dental practice environment. Facts from the literature on HSV, VZV, HIV,
Hepatitis B, C and D viruses, Mycobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp., Legionella spp. and multi-resistant
bacteria are presented. There is evidence that Hepatitis B virus is a real threat for cross-infection in dentistry.
Data for the transmission of, and infection with, other viruses or bacteria in dental practice are scarce.
However, a number of cases are probably not acknowledged by patients, healthcare workers and authorities.
Furthermore, cross-transmission in dentistry is under-reported in the literature. For the above reasons, the
real risks of cross-transmission are likely to be higher. There is therefore a need for prospective longitudinal
research in this area, to determine the real risks of cross-infection in dentistry. This will assist the adoption of
effective hygiene procedures in dental practice.

The oral cavity is a natural habitat for a large

number of microorganisms. This ecological niche
can be a reservoir for opportunistic and patho-
genic microorganisms that can pose a risk for cross-
contamination and infection and may even cause
systemic infections. This is of particular importance in
the case of routine dental practice, as the risk of exposure
to microorganisms in the oral cavity is increased due to
the open and invasive nature of the procedures.

It is important

to consider that the pathways of
contamination can be bidirectional. An infectious micro-
organism may be transferred from the patient to mem-
bers of the dental team, but also vice versa, e.g. through
the hands of
team. Moreover, another
infectious association is the transfer of pathogens from
patient to patient, without the mediation of the dental
staff, but rather through a surface located in the
dental practice, or a device or instrument used during

the dental

dental procedures. This can apply in the case of
inadequate sterilization of the dental
instruments or
disinfection of the dental unit. The possibility also exists
that pathogens present
in dental unit waterlines
(DUWLs) could be spread by aerosols created by dental
hand-pieces, presenting a risk for both the patient and
members of the dental team.

There are a number of possible means by which
transmission of viral and bacterial pathogens can occur
in the dental practice. The patient’s own saliva and blood
are major vectors of cross-transmission. Blood-borne
contamination can occur by exposure to the infectious
material through non-intact skin and mucosal lesions.
The highest infectious risk of this type is associated with
accidental punctures by contaminated needles or injuries
by sharp instruments. Insufficient cross-contamination
control, such as improperly sterilized dental instruments,
is also a possible device-borne means of pathogen

transmission. Emanation of the pathogens through the
spray of the hand-pieces of the dental unit can also be
considered an air-borne or water-borne means of trans-
mission, which may affect both the patient and the dental
team. Air-borne infections can also occur via an
inefficient ventilation system in the dental practice
environment, whereby contaminated air may be withheld
or recycled. Overall, the risk of any such transmission
depends on the dose of the pathogens transmitted, the
virulence of the pathogen, as well as the frequency or
probability of exposure to the infectious material and the
state of the host immune responses.

The aim of this position paper on healthcare-associated
infections in dentistry was primarily to evaluate cross-
transmission risks of relevant viral and bacterial infec-
tions based on the evidence available in the current
literature.

Viruses

Herpes viruses
Herpes viruses are ubiquitous human pathogens which can
all be found in the oral environment. Cross-transmission
risks in dentistry are mainly related to herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) and to varicella-zoster
virus (VZV). Oral secreta can also be infectious in the sub-
clinical phase of herpes virus infections and constitute a
risk of cross-transmission.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
In Europe, the age standardized seropositivity for HSV-1
ranges from 52% in Finland to 84% in Bulgaria and the
Czech Republic. For HSV-2 the seroprevalence ranges
from 4% in England and Wales to 24% in Bulgaria (1).
Seropositivity increases with age. In the US on average
60.3% of the population is infected with HSV-1 (2). The
seroprevalence of HSV-1 is 92% and of HSV-2 is 13.2% in
rural parts of East China (3). Twenty to forty percent of
the seropositive subjects have recurrent infections in the
oral region and asymptomatic shedding is common (4).
Manipulation of the oral region, endotracheal intubation
and immune-suppression are health or medical care-
associated factors known to provoke oral reactivation of
HSV-1 (5, 6). Previously, HSV-1 primary infections were
commonly acquired in childhood. According to recent
literature, however, a large proportion of young adults in
Western countries today are not infected with HSV-1 (1).
HSV is highly contagious and is transmitted via
exposure of the mucosa or skin to infectious secreta or
contents of an infectious HSV blister. In the periphery,
HSV-1 is most commonly associated with mucosal
infections of the oral region and HSV-2 with genital
infections, although both viruses are detected in either
anatomical region. In the oral region, HSV-1 primary
infection causes gingivostomatitis in 110% of patients

and labial herpes or intraoral herpetic ulcers are typical
symptoms of reactivation (7).

Unless adequate personal protection is worn,

the
dental team and the patient are at risk of being exposed
to HSV via direct contact with herpetic ulcers or
infectious splatters from herpetic lesions or saliva (8).
This could result in mucosal or skin infections, keratitis
or herpetic whitlow. Outside the body HSV is inactivated
within hours and is easily inactivated by disinfectants,
such as alcohols.

There are only a few reports of HSV cross-infection in
the dental practice. The frequency of herpetic whitlow
was observed to be higher among practicing dentists
compared to the normal population (9). However, reports
confirming the transmission of infection from the patient
to the dental team infection are available in the literature
(8). Also the cross-infection of HSV from dental team to
patients has been shown. A dental hygienist with a
herpetic whitlow, who did not use gloves routinely,
infected 20 out of 46 patients (10).

A large portion of the adult population is infected with
HSV-1 and reactivations resulting in subclinical or
symptomatic infection are frequent. However,
little
research is published on the cross-transmission and
infection of HSV-1 through the dental practice.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)
Chickenpox is the manifestation of VZV primary infec-
tion. About 90% of unvaccinated children acquire chick-
enpox before school age (11). In the periphery, VZV
reactivation typically manifests as zoster of the skin or
mucosa affecting 13 dermatomes in an episode. 2030%
of people are estimated to have zoster during lifetime
(12). VZV can be also asymptomatically shed in saliva.
Immune suppressed patients are at increased risk for
disseminated disease and in non-immune pregnant
women fetal infections are possible.

VZV is a highly contagious virus. It is transmitted
through direct contact to the blisters or exposure to
infectious droplets from saliva or the respiratory system.
Airborne transmission is also possible (13).

Cross-transmission during dental care has not been
reported, but VZV is known to cause healthcare-asso-
ciated infections. After inadvertent exposure in the
hospital environment, the transmission rate has been
reported to be 4.529% (14). Respiratory secreta can
already be contagious 24 days before varicella rash
eruption. In addition to rashes, secreta of a zoster patient
may also be contagious (15). VZV DNA has been
detected in the environmental contact area of a zoster
patient but also in the air-conditioner filter in a zoster
patient’s room,
indicating a possibility of spread by
aerosols from zoster patients (15, 16).

There is no evidence of VZV cross-transmission within
dental healthcare but reports from other medical fields

indicate that VZV infection constitutes a risk for
healthcare-associated transmission of VZV in the dental
practice as well.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
In the 2010 UNAIDS report the total number of people
infected with HIV worldwide in 2009 was estimated to be
33.3 million (0.8% of the global population). The HIV
prevalence ranges from 0.2% in Central and Western
Europe to 5% in Sub-Saharan Africa.

In prospective studies the risk of HIV infection after
the percutaneous exposure to HIV infected blood was
estimated to be 0.3% (17, 18). After mucous membrane
exposure the risk is approximately 0.09% (19). The risk of
acquiring HIV after exposure to tissues or other body
fluids of an HIV infected person is not quantified, but is
thought to be substantially lower (18). The risk of an
infection correlates with the volume of blood exposure
and blood viral counts (20). Transmission of HIV via
saliva is considered unlikely due to low salivary viral
titers, low numbers of CD4-positive target cells and the
presence of anti-HIV antibodies and salivary antiviral
factors protecting oral tissues (21).

Until December 2002, there were 344 published cases
worldwide in which healthcare workers were infected
with HIV as a result of their profession (22). Of these,
106 were documented to result
from occupational
exposure. For dental professionals eight possible occu-
pationally acquired HIV infections were published,
although no cases were confirmed (22). In four cases
transmission of HIV from a healthcare worker to a
patient was reported; a dentist in Florida, USA (23), a
nurse in France (24), an orthopedic surgeon in France
(25) and an obstetrician in Spain (26). Transmission of
HIV from patient to patient has been reported, particu-
larly as a result of poor infection control in developing
countries and in developed countries in recipients of
blood and blood products (27). There are no reports of
patient to patient transmission of HIV in the dental
practice.

The risk of transmission of HIV through the dental
practice appears to be low; however, the data may not
provide the complete picture. For instance, no occupa-
tionally acquired HIV infections were reported in Asia or
parts of Africa and South America, yet the prevalence of
HIV in some of these areas is high (28). Given that the
risk of exposure to HIV is expected to be higher in areas
where the prevalence of HIV infection is high, one would
have anticipated reported cases of healthcare associated
HIV transmission from these areas too.

Hepatitis B virus
The prevalence of chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infections (positive for surface antigen HBsAg) ranges
from B2% in Europe and the USA to 8% in Asia.

Healthcare-associated infections in dentistry

However, the prevalence of people that have experienced
an HBV infection at some stage (positive for antibodies
to HBc) ranges from 415% in low endemic countries to
4090% in high endemic countries (29).

Before HBV vaccination was available, HBV infection
was considered to be an occupational risk for healthcare
workers and laboratory personnel (30). Following the
introduction of the vaccine in 1983, the percentage of
dentists with serological evidence of an HBV infection
declined, especially in young dentists (31). However, even
after the vaccine became available, healthcare providers
remained at risk for HBV infection (32). The risk of an
infection with HBV highly depends on the volume of
blood and on the Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status
of the source (33). The risk of HBV transmission to a
healthcare worker after the percutaneous exposure to
HBeAg- and HBsAg-positive blood is approximately
30%. The risk of HBV transmission after the percuta-
neous exposure to HBsAg-positive, HBeAg-negative
blood is 16% (34). Besides
through percutaneous
injuries, HBV infection can also result from (in)direct
blood or body fluid exposure through inoculation into
cutaneous scratches, abrasions, burns or on mucosal
surfaces (35). HBV has demonstrated the ability to
survive and remain infectious in dried blood at room
temperature on environmental surfaces for at least 1
week and probably longer (36).

The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) described
300 patients that were infected through HBV-infected
healthcare workers, including dentists and oral surgeons
(34). Perry et al.
(37) reported that a total of 12
healthcare workers had infected 91 patients with HBV
between 1991 and 2005. The percentage of patients
infected by the healthcare workers was 2.96%. None of
the healthcare workers were dentists or members of the
dental team. Recently, patient-to-patient transmission of
HBV in an oral surgery practice was demonstrated using
molecular techniques (38). In this case an older woman
that had oral surgery contracted an acute Hepatitis B
virus infection 2 months after her visit to the oral
surgeon. The source turned out to be a woman that had
oral surgery on the same date, in the same room, with
the same hospital staff, 2 hours before the index patient.
Other patients that were treated on the same day and the
hospital staff that worked on that day were not infected.
Interestingly, the CDC did not find breaches in standard
infection control practices (38).

Vaccination of healthcare workers for HBV has greatly
reduced the risk of transmission of HBV. However, HBV
is highly infectious and vaccination for HBV is not
standard for healthcare workers throughout the world.
Moreover, patient-to-patient transmission of HBV has
recently been proven. The risk of transmission of HBV
through the dental practice remains an issue.

Hepatitis C virus
The prevalence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
ranges from 0.11% in Northern Europe, 0.21.2% in
Central Europe and 2.53.5% in Southern Europe (39).
However, the prevalence of HCV infection can be as high
as 26% in the southern parts of Italy (40). In the eastern
part of Europe the prevalence of HCV infection was
reported to be 0.94.9% of blood donors and 110% of
healthcare workers (41). High prevalence of HCV outside
of Europe is found in Egypt (14.9%), Taiwan (4.4%),
Vietnam (22.9%) and Pakistan (3%) (42). Here the
regional differences are large as well. The prevalence
rate of HCV is 30% in the Punjab region in Pakistan.

Relatively little is known about the occupational risk of
HCV infection. The average transmission rate of HCV
after exposure is about 0.5% (43), much lower than for
HBV and slightly higher than for HIV. The risk of
transmission of HCV was significantly associated with
hollow-bore needle placement in the source patient’s
artery or vein, deep injury and the sex of the healthcare
worker. All cases of HCV transmission occurred after
percutaneous exposure to viraemic blood or body fluids
and the risk of transmission increased with the HCV viral
load (44).

Perry et al. (37) reported a total of 11 HCV-positive
healthcare workers that infected 38 patients between 1991
and 2005. The HCV-infected healthcare workers did not
include dentists or oral surgeons. One study (45) assessed
the risk of HCV infection among dentists in New York.
Dentists and especially oral surgeons were at higher risk
of having anti-HCV antibodies in their blood than
matched blood donors. The higher risk for HCV infection
was only attributed to occupational exposure. In the
Netherlands, two cases of Hepatitis C virus infection
resulting from blood exposure accidents have been
documented in healthcare workers (46, 47). Occasionally,
cases of acute HCV infection are attributed to blood
exposure accidents. In a UK dental practice 1.2% of the
staff
the dentists) were positive for HCV
antibodies. Since the prevalence of HCV in the British
population is 0.080.55%, the dental healthcare workers
have a slightly higher risk of HCV infection compared to
the general population (48).

(none of

In the general population the prevalence of HCV-
infected patients is relatively low. In combination with a
low average transmission rate, the risk of HCV transmis-
sion in the dental practice appears to be low. Research
seems to support
little is
known about the transmission of HCV in comparison
to HBV and HIV. Vaccination for HBV does not protect
against infection with HCV.

this conclusion. However,

Hepatitis D virus
Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection can only occur in
patients that are HBV co-infected. The incidence of

Hepatitis D virus infection is not known, but is thought
to be at about 5% of HBV carriers. In the literature, there
is a lack of available reports regarding HDV infections in
dentistry. One paper reported an outbreak of HDV in the
1980s where dentists were involved (49).

Bacteria
Viruses are mainly associated with a specific disease
whilst for many bacteria this is not the case. Often
transmission of bacteria does not result
in a real
infection, especially when opportunistic bacteria are
involved. In the following sections, some severe patho-
gens are discussed that are potentially transmitted in the
dental office. Furthermore, special forms of commensal
bacteria that are (multi)-resistant
to antibiotics are
discussed, since they can result in severe and even lethal
infections.

Mycobacterium ssp.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes the disease tubercu-
losis (TB). Other Mycobacterium spp. such as M. bovis
are also capable of causing the disease. TB continues to
be a major health burden in the twenty-first century with
an estimated 1.7 million deaths every year (50). In the
UK the number of reported cases of TB have been rising
in recent years (51). Furthermore, the emergence of
multi-drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis (MDR-
TB) is a major problem in the successful treatment and
control of TB (52). Transmission of M. tuberculosis
occurs through aerosols generated by coughing, sneezing
and speaking. M. tuberculosis can remain airborne within
small droplets for several hours and susceptible indivi-
duals can still become infected (52). It is thought that as
few as 15 bacilli are required to initiate infection (53).
Only about 30% of those exposed to TB are infected, 90%
of them latently. In latent infection the bacteria remain
viable in the body for many years without causing an
active infection but retain the ability to activate under
favorable conditions. It is not possible to predict who will
develop active TB at some point (54). However, risk
factors include immune-compromising situations such as
chronic inflammatory diseases, during antitumor necrosis
factor therapy, diabetes/obesity or a HIV co-infection
(55). Other risk factors include alcoholism, and poor
nutrition (54).

The possibility of M. tuberculosis transmission within
dental settings has been subject to risk assessments by the
CDC. Most dental clinics in the US were considered to
fall within a very low risk category (56, 57). Despite the
putative low risk, evidence for the transmission of TB in
dental practice is present. In the UK a report documen-
ted cases of intraoral and pulmonary TB in patients that
had been infected by their dental surgeon (58). All of the
patients had tooth extractions performed by the dental
surgeon who had active pulmonary TB. Furthermore,

dental team-to-dental team and possibly patient-to dental
team TB infection was documented (59, 60). Hospital
dental staff may be at increased risk of exposure to TB
(60, 61).

The risk of TB transmission in the dental practice
appears to be low. However, transmission of TB remains
possible, primarily through patients from high risk areas
in the world or from patients with reactivated TB
infections such as the present-day elderly who may have
been exposed to TB in their youth.

Pseudomonas spp.
The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa
is frequently recovered from DUWLs where it can form
biofilms in the tubing. Pseudomonas spp. may pose
an important health hazard, particularly for immune-
compromised patients. P. aeruginosa is associated with
many types of
including hospital-acquired
pneumonia (62), skin infections (63), urinary tract in-
fections (64), burns (65), eye infections (66) and blood
stream infections (67). Furthermore, P. aeruginosa is in-
creasingly becoming multi-drug resistant, thus negatively
affecting patient outcomes (68).

infection,

P. aeruginosa was isolated in 25% of studied DUWLs
in Canada (69) and in 8% of DUWLs in Switzerland,
where the dental chair units older than 5 years were
contaminated significantly more often than new units
(70). Patients with cystic fibrosis, known to be exception-
ally susceptible to Pseudomonas spp.
infections, were
investigated for the presence of P. aeruginosa after a
dental visit. P. aeruginosa was isolated from up to 5% of
DUWLs, but only one patient tested positive in sputum
for genotypically matched P. aeruginosa (71). Others
reported two patients with solid tumors that developed
gingival abscesses with pyocin-matched P. aeruginosa
after dental treatment. Furthermore, 78 subjects with
no underlying medical condition were transiently colo-
nized for 35 weeks with P. aeruginosa when treated in a
unit with contaminated water (72).

Given that

the incidence of Pseudomonas spp.

in
DUWLs is high but that there are limited reported cases
of infection following exposure to DUWLs, it is apparent
that the risk of infection is very low. Although reports in
this area are conflicting (73, 74); DUWL endotoxin from
gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp., has
been suggested to complicate the healing processes after
periodontal surgery operations (75) and to induce asthma
exacerbations (74). Therefore, further studies will be
needed to verify this potential health hazard.

Legionella spp.
Legionella spp. can cause a severe form of pneumonia in
humans: Legionnaires’ disease, and a less severe flu-like
disease: Pontiac fever. Legionella pneumophila, particu-
larly L. pneumophila serogroup 1, is the most common

Healthcare-associated infections in dentistry

etiological agent of Legionnaires’ disease although other
species of the Legionella genus can also be causal (76).
Inhalation of aerosols contaminated with Legionella spp.
acts as the main route of transmission (77). Legionnaires’
disease outbreaks have frequently been associated with
contaminated aerosol-producing water systems such as
showers, humidifiers and water-cooling towers. Legionella
spp. can readily multiply in water at
temperatures
between 25 and 458C (78), especially in stagnant water
and they grow in biofilms. Legionnaires’ disease is
considered to be an important nosocomial
infection,
about 11.5% of reported Legionnaires’ disease cases in
the UK between 1980 and 2009 were hospital-acquired
(UK’s Health Protection Agency, January 2011). Out-
breaks of Legionnaires’ disease in hospitals have been
predominantly associated with contaminated potable
water supplies (79).

Legionella spp. presents a potential risk in the dental
clinic where contaminated DUWLs could act as a source
of infection to both dental staff and patients. DUWLs
harbor microbial biofilms that are seeded by the mains
water supply and can provide a suitable environment for
the multiplication of Legionella spp. within protozoa (80).
Studies of contamination of DUWLs frequently detected
Legionella spp. among the bacteria present, although
their prevalence varies substantially between different
studies (8184). In particular, prevalence rates vary with
differing geographic location (80). While the prevalence
of Legionella spp. in UK DUWLs varies between 0.37
and 1.19%, similar studies in the US show prevalence
rates of 68% (83, 85), although differences in methodol-
ogy could be responsible for these differences. The
number of colony forming units (CFU’s) of Legionella
spp. found in DUWLs has been reported to be around
102105 CFU/ml. The infective dose of Legionella spp. is
thought to be greater than 105 CFU/ml (86).

Recently a case was published of a patient that was
infected with L. pneumophila serogroup 1 which origi-
nated from a dental office in Italy (87). After hospitaliza-
tion because of the pulmonary problems, the patient died
from this infection. By using molecular typing methods, it
was clearly shown that the source of the Legionella
infection was the DUWL in a dental practice, where both
the tap water and the unit water were contaminated. It is
remarkable that only one patient acquired this Legionella.
Even Pontiac fever was not found within the other
patients in this office. This is
time that
Legionnaires’ disease resulting from visits to, or treat-
ment in, a dental clinic was documented. To date, there
are no known cases of Pontiac fever in patients, resulting
from visits to, or treatment in, a dental clinic. This would
indicate that the risk to patients posed by Legionella spp.
from DUWLs is low. However the risk is not absent and
infection can have dramatic consequences. In addition,
cases of Pontiac fever that appear 1 week after a dental

visit may not be recognized as such and the link between
disease and dental treatment is not acknowledged.

There is a single documented fatal case of Legion-
naire’s disease in a US dentist. In this case the infection
was attributed to exposure of the dentist to DUWL
aerosols containing Legionella spp. (81). L. pneumophilia
and L. longbeachae were detected in the dentist’s lung
tissue and in the DUWLs, however, the dentist’s domestic
water supplies also had very low levels of Legionella spp.
The evidence in this case was not conclusive. Studies have
found dental staff
to have higher serum levels of
antibodies specific to Legionella spp. than members of
the general public (88, 89). This is indicative of an
increased occupational exposure to Legionella spp.
through contaminated aerosols.

Despite this, no other cases of Legionnaires’ disease or
Pontiac fever shown to result from occupational exposure
have been documented in dental staff. However, the lack
of investigation into the DUWLs of the dental clinics in
other cases of Legionnaire’s disease or Pontiac fever in
dental staff could have led to under-reporting.

Multi-resistant bacteria
Multi-resistant bacteria pose a major health risk and are
increasing the cost of healthcare worldwide (90). Multi-
resistant bacteria are mainly transmitted by direct contact
or indirectly via contaminated surfaces. Increased risk of
colonization by multi-resistant bacteria is associated with
long hospital stays, living in a nursing home, institutional
and international patient transfers, surgical procedures
and the presence of invasive devices, severe medical
conditions, immune suppression and antimicrobial ther-
apy (91, 92). Currently, the most problematic healthcare-
associated multi-resistant species are methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum b-
lactamase
(ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and
carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria (93).

S. aureus asymptomatically colonizes the oropharynx
or the skin of 2030% of people and it has been isolated
from various oral infections (94). S. aureus is a commen-
sal bacterium, but is also responsible for skin infections,
septicaemia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia and
toxic shock syndrome (95). Among hospitalized patients
receiving treatment
for oral conditions, oral cancer
patients have been reported to be at increased risk for
MRSA colonization (96)(98). Carriage rate is influenced
by the age and the overall disease status of the host (99).
MRSA is resistant to all b-lactam antibiotics including
methicillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, cephalosporins and
carbapenems and may also display resistance to some
other antibiotics.

During the past 10 years, community-acquired MRSA
(CA-MRSA)
infections have been increasing (100).
Studies on the oral or nasopharyngeal MRSA coloniza-
tion rate report a prevalence of up to 26%, depending on

the population (101). In a recent literature review, MRSA
carriage in healthcare workers was found to be 4.6%,
which is above the rate of the normal population (102). In
most studies, MRSA carriage in dental healthcare work-
ers has not been above the level of the normal adult
population (101). In the greater Houston metropolitan
area 4.2% of dentists and 1.5% of dental hygienists were
positive for MRSA (103) whereas only 1.5% of the non-
institutionalized US citizens are colonized with MRSA
(104). Others showed that 21% of dental students were
found to be carrying MRSA in their nose (105). MRSA
carriage in dental staff could pose a risk for transmission
of MRSA to the patients or co-workers. In the UK, a
dentist carrying MRSA was proven to have transmitted
MRSA to two patients having oral surgery (106). During
1 year of surveillance in a dental hospital clinic, 8 (out of
140) patients were colonized or infected with MRSA after
treatment. The airwater syringe and the chair arm of the
dental chair were contaminated with MRSA. The anti-
biograms revealed that the isolated MRSA strains were
similar between patients and the contaminated chair and
it was concluded that the patients were colonized or
infected by (parts of) the dental chair (107). Furthermore,
MRSA has been isolated in dental clinics outside of the
hospital environment (108). Moreover, devices such as
dental impression guns were reported to be contaminated
with MRSA in routine use (109). Dental impressions and
gypsum casts were also shown to be heavily colonized by
MRSA (110).

Bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae can acquire
the ability to produce the enzyme extended-spectrum b-
lactamases
to
penicillins, second and third generation cephalosporins
and monobactams (111).

(ESBL) making them multi-resistant

Carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria such
as Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) are the
most recent and serious threat of healthcare-associated
infections since they are resistant to all b-lactam anti-
biotics and they display co-resistance to other antibiotics.
They have spread particularly via international hospital
transfers from epidemic areas. In addition, Enterobac-
teriaceae harboring New Delhi metallo-b-lactamase-1
(NDM-1) have been repeatedly introduced in Europe
via patient transfers (92).

In healthy individuals oral colonization by Enterobac-
teriaceae or Pseudomonas spp. is usually transient (112).
Even transiently colonizing bacteria can be part of the
flora of oral cavity related abscesses and source of cross-
transmission (113). ESBL-producers were detected in
oropharyngeal samples of 40% of the inhabitants in an
Italian long-term-care facility (114) and in the throat of
patients in intensive care units (115, 116). There are no
published reports available on the possible association of
ESBL- or carbapenemase-producers and oral infections

nor evidence for transmission of these bacteria through
the dental practice.

Hence, MRSA has been shown to be transmitted in
dental care. However, evidence for the transmission of
ESBL- and carbapenemase-producers does not exist yet,
although transmission in the dental practice is possible.

General considerations and concluding remarks
This paper aimed to report and discuss the current
literature on the transmission of relevant viruses and
bacteria in dentistry. All viruses and bacteria discussed
above can be, and most have been, proven to be
transmitted to the patient or the dental team in the
dental practice. It appears that the transmission of, and
infection with, Hepatitis B virus poses the greatest risk
for both patients and the dental team, based on the
incidence and risk of transmission. Literature on the
transmission of the other bacteria and viruses is scarce
and it seems that the risk for transmission resulting in an
infection with these microorganisms is low. It should be
noted, however, that transmission of pathogens may
result in an asymptomatic infection that can last weeks
or even months until symptoms appear (Table 1). In
addition,
it is likely that some patients that visit the
dental practice are not aware of their infectious status
and may carry an asymptomatic infection. There is a lack
of prospective longitudinal studies that investigate the
incidence of healthcare-associated infections in patients
after dental treatment.

small

Another important point to keep in mind is that
the likelihood of healthcare-associated infections, parti-
cularly in dentistry, of being detected, reported, docu-
mented and published is
(37). Therefore,
healthcare-associated infections are under-reported in
literature from the developed world (27, 117). In devel-
oping countries the risk of
transmission of several
microorganisms, for instance the blood borne viruses, is
high since a large section of the population is infected.
However, literature on the subject from these countries
is scarce.

Healthcare-associated infections in dentistry

Based on the number of reported cases, most of which
were of blood borne viruses, the actual risk for develop-
ing an infectious disease through the dental practice
appears to be low. However, the real transmission rate of
the viruses and bacteria that are discussed in this paper
is probably higher. As long as accurate data are absent,
the dental team should be fully aware of the risk of
dissemination of potentially hazardous microorganisms
and ensure that efficient cross-infection control proce-
dures are well in place (118). Every member of the team
must follow the standard procedures required to prevent
the transmission of microorganisms. Besides preventing
disease by vaccination,
these include hand hygiene,
personal barrier protection, instrument disinfection and
sterilization protocols, surface decontamination strate-
gies, approaches to maintain the quality of DUWLs, as
well as the emergency procedures in case of accidents that
would increase the risk of cross-transmission. These
procedures substantially lower the risk of the transmis-
sion of microorganisms. Every patient should be treated
as potentially infectious. The dental team should be
acquainted with the biological principles behind these
procedures. The
regulations
should undergo regular monitoring and need to be
subjected to revision whenever necessary.
