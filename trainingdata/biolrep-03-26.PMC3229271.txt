Abstract
The polyubiquitin signal is post-translationally attached to a large number of proteins, often directing
formation of macromolecular complexes resulting in the translocation, assembly or degradation of
the attached protein. Recent structural and functional studies reveal general mechanisms by which
different architectures and length of the signal are distinguished.

Introduction
Post-translational modification of proteins is a widespread
mechanism to fine tune the structure, function and loca-
tion of proteins encoded by the surprisingly small number
of genes in most organisms. Among these modifications,
one of the most versatile and intriguing modifications is
the covalent attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like
proteins to target proteins [1-5]. In this commentary we
will argue that, in contrast to modifications such as phos-
phorylation, methylation, acetylation, etc., the attachment
of one or more ubiquitins provides a large interaction
surface by which the modification can be decoded [6] and
results in a vast number of potential signals by virtue of
the varied architectures linking the multiple ubiquitin
molecules. Ubiquitination of proteins directs the modified
proteins to different cellular fates such as translocation, as-
sembly or degradation, depending on the type of tagging.
Recent studies have begun to define the roles of these
different polyubiquitin signals in physiology and disease
[7-11], and it is obvious that the manipulation of these
signals and their recognition will be important in under-
standing and treating human disease. For example, defects
in the pathway by which Ubiquitination tags proteins
for proteolysis in the proteosome have been linked to
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s [7] and
Parkinson’s disease [8].

Diversity of polyubiquitin chains and linkages
Polyubiquitin chains consist of ubiquitin monomers
linked to each other covalently by an isopeptide bond
between the C-terminus of one ubiquitin and an amine
from one of the seven lysines or the N-terminal methionine
of the next ubiquitin. A variety of polyubiquitin chains
have been detected in cellular lysates [12], varying in length
and linkage (Figure 1). Moreover, the chains can also be
mixed, i.e. containing other heterologous proteins from the
ubiquitin family such as SUMO (small ubiquitin-like
modifier) [13].

Polyubiquitin can signal in the cell as unanchored chains
[14, 15], with one free C-terminus on the proximal
subunit, or as a molecular tag attached through this C-
terminus to a lysine in a target protein. As the latter might
have several lysines, the same protein can carry several
different polyubiquitin tags associated with it [16].

Assembly and disassembly of different
polyubiquitin chains
Some unanchored polyubiquitin chains are synthesised by
the sequential reactions of two enzymes: E1 (the ubiquitin
activating enzyme) and E2 (the ubiquitin conjugating
enzyme). Pioneering work from Cecile Pickart showed
that E1 and E2-25K synthesize unanchored homogeneous

Figure 1. Architecture of polyubiquitin chains

Unanchored chains are shown here. These are often found attached to a target protein via an isopeptide bond between the free C-terminus of the
proximal ubiquitin and an amino group on the target protein. Chains can be “linear” (no more than one amino group of each ubiquitin is linked to another
ubiquitin) or “branched” (at least one ubiquitin is attached to other ubiquitins via two or more different amino groups). The ubiquitin containing the free
C-terminus is the “proximal” subunit and the ubiquitin(s) lacking any amino group linkage is a “distal subunit”. The polymers are referred to as “homogeneous” if
all linkages use the same amino group on each ubiquitin. They are termed “heterogeneous” if ubiquitin linkages involve different amino groups on different
subunits. Chains containing other ubiquitin-like proteins are called “heterologous” or “mixed”. The type of linkage is designated by the identity of the amino
group used, i.e. Met1-, Lys6-, Lys11-, Lys27-, Lys29-, Lys33-, Lys48-, Lys63-linked. Note that Met1-linked ubiquitin is identical to the proprotein product of
the polyubiquitin gene and has often been referred to as linear polyubiquitin. We propose the Met1-linked nomenclature to avoid the confusion with
unbranched chains described above. In the “open” conformations the hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin is exposed, while in the “closed” conformations this
patch is buried by ubiquitin-ubiquitin interactions. Abbreviations: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier.

Lys48-linked chains, while ligation of similar chains linked
through Lys63 requires the UBC (ubiquitin C)13/MMS2
heterodimer as the E2 [17]. Many other isolated E2s
synthesize multiple types of linkages. The length and
linkage type of polyubiquitin chains can also be modulated
by a third enzyme, the E3 ubiquitin ligase. In most cases,
this E3 ligase is required for assembly of a polyubiquitin
chain on a protein acceptor.

Chains can also be remodelled or disassembled by various
deubiquitinating enzymes, proteases that cleave the (iso)
peptide bond between ubiquitins or ubiquitin and a target
protein. Deubiquitinating enzymes can show considerable
specificity. For instance, isopeptidase T (USP5 [ubiquitin-
specific protease 5]) only acts efficiently on free poly-
ubiquitin chains but shows little linkage selectivity [18].
Proteasomal deubiquitinating enzymes require association

with the proteasome for maximal efficiency although the
precise chain specificity is still unclear. Structural analysis
of several deubiquitinases explains why TRABID cleaves
the Lys29 linkage 40-fold more efficiently than the Lys63
linkage, Cezanne is specific for Lys11 linked chains [19],
CYLD prefers Lys63-linked chains [20], and OTU1/
Otubain is selective for long Lys48-linked chains [21, 22].
In many other cases the deubiquitinating enzyme’s
specificity is either minimal or has not been determined.
Thus, the type of polyubiquitin chain that is accumulated
will depend on the specificity of the enzymes that synthe-
size the chain (E2/E3) and disassemble it (deubiquitinat-
ing enzymes).

Indeed, because of the sequential action of various deubi-
quitinases (deubiquitinating enzymes) and/or conjugat-
ing enzymes/ligases, the length and linkage composition

of a given chain can be dynamic [23]. For instance, the
promiscuous UBCH5 family of E2s combines with either
of two E3 ligases, CIAP (a cellular inhibitor of apoptosis)
or APC (the anaphase promoting complex), to mono-
ubiquitinate their respective substrates [24-27]. Subse-
quently Lys11-linked chains are elaborated by these E3s
using the E2 enzyme UBE (ubiquitin-activating enzyme)
2S. BRCA1/BARD1 autoubiquitination also shows this
progression of priming (monoubiquitination) followed
by elongation (polyubiquitination). Six different E2s can
monoubiquitinate BRCA1, while different E2s are then
used to elongate the chains with Lys63 (UBC13/MMS2),
Lys48 (UBE2K), or Lys6 (UBCH5) linkages [28]. Certain
pairs of E2 and E3 can also synthesize branched chains
[16]. In another classic example of chain remodelling, A20
(a large enzyme with both deubiquitinating enzymes and
E3 ligase activity) is thought to first trim K63-linked
substrates of the NF-kB (nuclear transcription factor kappa
B) pathway and then elaborate a K48-linked chain that
results in the degradation of the substrate.

How does chain architecture determine the
fate of polyubiquitinated proteins?
Importantly, all these polyubiquitin forms appear to serve
different functions (targeting/localization, complex assem-
bly, modulation of function or stability). The underlying
structure-function hypothesis is that the chain linkage (and
possibly chain length) defines the ensemble of structures/
conformations that a particular chain can adopt [10, 24,
29-31]. In turn, this structure defines the chain’s ability to
interact with specific receptors in a linkage specific manner
[22, 32-39]. The critical question is how signalling speci-
ficity is achieved despite the vast variety of polyubiquitin
chain structures/conformations.

Two features of ubiquitin chains are essential for this
signalling: the hydrophobic patch on one face of the mono-
mers [40, 41], and a highly flexible C-terminus, resulting in
significant flexibility of each ubiquitin-ubiquitin linker in
the chain [42]. In fact, Lys48-linked di- and tetra-ubiquitin
chains under physiological conditions are in equilibrium
between a predominantly “closed” conformation (where
the hydrophobic patches are sequestered at the ubiquitin/
ubiquitin interface) and one or more open conformations
[42-44], whereas Lys63-linked chains predominantly
adopt an extended structure exposing the hydrophobic
patches and making them readily available for interactions
with receptors [38, 45]. The emerging structural data and
computer modelling indicate an even greater structural
variability for chains connected through other lysines [19,
32, 46, 47]. We anticipate that chain branching might
result in structures and intra-chain contacts unavailable
for linear-topology chains, thus potentially further enhan-
cing the signalling capability of polyubiquitin.

Polyubiquitin receptors
Specific recognition of polyubiquitin is accomplished
by proteins containing one or more ubiquitin-binding
domains. There are at least 20 families of ubiquitin-
binding domains (Table 1) and many polyubiquitin-
binding proteins contain multiple copies, often consisting
of two or three different ubiquitin-binding domains con-
nected by flexible linkers [48-53]. The most common of
these domains, including the UBA (ubiquitin-associated)
domain and UIM (ubiquitin-interacting motif), bind to a
conserved hydrophobic patch on ubiquitin consisting of
Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 [48-53]. The affinity of all these
domains for ubiquitin is modest (µM) but tight binding is
achieved by avidity; the immobilization of polyubiquitin
by binding to one ubiquitin-binding domain lowers the
entropic barrier for binding of an adjacent ubiquitin to
another ubiquitin-binding domain, or for other protein-
protein interactions between the ligand and the intact
receptor [33, 48, 54].

Shuttling receptors
Moving ubiquitinated proteins within the cell is facilitated
by shuttling receptors [55-59]. These ubiquitin-binding
proteins contain one or more ubiquitin-binding domains.
One type of shuttling receptor, the UBX (ubiquitin regu-
latory X domain) family of p97 cofactors, contains both
a ubiquitin-binding domain (of the UBA family) and a
ubiquitin-like domain (of the UBX family) and acts as an
adapter localizing polyubiquitinated proteins to the p97
AAA ATPase (an ATPase associated with a variety of cellular
activities) [60, 61]. Subsequent delivery of the ubiquiti-
nated proteins to the proteasome could be direct or the
substrate could be handed off to other shuttling proteins
[62]. Ubiquitin-like domains can act as autoinhibitory
sequences by binding to the ubiquitin-binding domain,
competing with ubiquitin binding [55] and/or directing
the ubiquitin-binding protein to another receptor or the
proteasome. Networks of ubiquitin binding domain/
ubiquitin-like domain containing proteins could assem-
ble into oligomers or a lattice that would provide a highly
selective array of ubiquitin-binding sites that exhibit spe-
cificity for particular polyubiquitin chain linkages. Indeed,
studies on artificial oligomeric UBA domains such as GST
(glutathione S-transferase)-UBA fusions or TUBES (tandem
ubiquitin-binding entities) have emphasized that the
observed specificity is determined more by the oligomeric
state of these domains than it is by the weak specificity
inherent in the isolated domains [37, 48].

Specific recognition of chain linkage
Specificity of chain binding is a required attribute of
receptors that sort proteins carrying differently linked
ubiquitins to different cellular fates. For instance Lys6-,
Lys11-, Lys29- and Lys48-linked substrates can be directed

to the proteasome [9, 63], while Lys63-linked and
Met1-linked chains serve non-proteolytic roles by assem-
bling protein complexes in the DNA-damage response and
NF-kB signalling pathways [15, 64, 65].

In general, it appears that proteins consisting of flexibly
linked ubiquitin-binding domains show little chain
specificity, in part because the polyubiquitin chain itself
is also very flexible [43, 44, 47]. If this conformational
flexibility is restricted in a physiological complex or
lattice, even these binding proteins could show modest
specificity. In contrast, receptors that recognize either the
isopeptide linkage or adjacent faces of ubiquitin that are
juxtaposed only in certain linkages can show much
higher chain linkage specificity [35, 53, 54, 66, 67] (see
Figure 2).

Importance of chain length
Since the initial observation of Pickart’s group that K48-
linked tetraubiquitin was the minimal effective length to
deliver proteins to the proteasome [68], the question of
how chain length affects the fate of a ubiquitinated
protein has been debated. Chains must achieve a length
that provides sufficient binding affinity through avidity,

but long chains may be so tightly bound as to prevent
dissociation of catalytic intermediates or “hand off” from
one receptor to the next [69]. In part, chain length can be
controlled by the degree of processiveness (repetitive
rounds of catalysis without releasing the substrate)
exhibited by the ubiquitin ligases [70-72] or by ubiquitin
chain editing catalyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes.
The modular nature of receptors containing multiple
ubiquitin-binding domains and the ability of longer
polyubiquitin chains to bind multiple receptors could
serve to act as length sensors (Figure 3). For instance, the
deubiquitinating enzyme USP5 selectively binds tetra-
ubiquitin with sub-nanomolar affinity using an ensemble
of four ubiquitin-binding sites [18]. Alternatively, a lattice
consisting of ubiquitin-binding domain/ubiquitin-
like domain-containing proteins that bind each other
and/or compete for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like domain
binding can show a marked length dependence on the
resulting complexes (as for example, Dsk2 and Rpn10
[56]). Longer polyubiquitin chains could be “handed off”
from one receptor to another in such a lattice, as
exemplified by the trafficking of ubiquitinated proteins
through the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required
for transport) complex [69]).

Figure 2. Specific recognition of polyubiquitin chains by deubiquitinating enzymes

Modes of recognition by deubiquitinating enzymes involve: a) binding to the proximal ubiquitin and the ubiquitinated protein resulting in removal
(amputation) of the chain; b) binding to the distal copy of ubiquitin only resulting in shortening (distal trimming) of the chain; c) binding to the specific
linkage and/or faces of ubiquitin uniquely juxtaposed by that linkage resulting in specific cleavage of one type of linkage; or d) binding of adjacent ubiquitins in
a chain by a deubiquitinating enzyme containing multiple ubiquitin binding domains, each bound to a single ubiquitin (pan specific). Abbreviations: Ub,

Localization of the polyubiquitin signal
Met1-linked chains (both unanchored and attached to
NEMO – an NF-kB modifier) can activate signalling in
the NF-kB pathway and directly activate some kinases
[15, 29, 73, 74]. Unanchored Met1-linked ubiquitin is
also the primary gene product of several ubiquitin genes
and is post-translationally assembled in response to
genotoxic stress and TNF-a by the E3 ligase LUBAC
(linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex) [75, 76].
Levels of M1-linked ubiquitin chains in cells are normally
very low [77], in part because the primary gene product is
co-translationally cleaved to monomeric ubiquitin at the
ribosome and in part because of the presence of large
amounts of USP5 deubiquitinating enzyme, the enzyme
responsible for disassembling polyubiquitin intermedi-
ates that might otherwise accumulate in the cell [18].
Thus, it is unlikely that Met1-linked chains are widely
distributed in the cell, and more likely that they are
locally generated at
the site(s) of signalling when
required. A similar argument can be made in the case of
ubiquitinated proteins that accumulate during signalling.
A great deal of cellular specificity in the ubiquitin
pathway seems to depend on the use of adaptors and
scaffolds that colocalize polyubiquitin and the enzymes
that metabolize it [78]. For instance, deubiquitinating
enzymes are very often found in the same protein
complexes as the ubiquitin ligases that synthesize poly-
ubiquitin [78, 79]. This suggests that if a polyubiquitin or

polyubiquitinated protein is not properly channelled to
its target by ubiquitin receptors it can be disassembled
before it leaves the site of synthesis.

Future directions
The incredible diversity of polyubiquitin chains observed
in vivo suggests that there is a similar complexity in the
receptors that recognize chains. It also seems likely that
additional ubiquitin-binding motifs and domains
remain to be discovered. In spite of the limited specificity
of isolated ubiquitin binding domains different chain
architectures effectively signal different cellular fates,
suggesting that a deeper understanding will be gained
from studies on binding specificity in the context of the
full-length receptors. As engineered and synthetic poly-
ubiquitins become available [46, 80-87], these will aid
structure determination of polyubiquitin-receptor com-
plexes that will be vital to understand the decoding of
the polyubiquitin signals. Finally, we need a more sop-
histicated understanding of the “hand off” of a receptor
bound polyubiquitin from one receptor to the next in
a pathway. For instance it is still a mystery how shuttl-
ing receptors hand off ubiquitin from the ligases and
chaperone complexes to the proteasome, or how sequential
ESCRT complexes can direct endocytic cargos carrying the
ubiquitin signal [69]. A detailed understanding of these
issues may pay dividends in treating diseases involving
errors in the ubiquitination pathway.
