In this study we show that metals, and in particular copper (Cu), can disrupt the lytic cycle
in the Emiliania huxleyi – EhV86 host–virus system. E. huxleyi
lysis rates were reduced
at high total Cu concentrations (> approximately 500 nM) in the presence and absence of
EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) in acute short term exposure experiments. Zinc
(Zn), cadmium (Cd), and cobalt (Co) were not observed to affect the lysis rate of EhV86 in
these experiments.The cellular glutathione (GSH) content increased in virus infected cells,
but not as a result of metal exposure. In contrast, the cellular content of phytochelatins
(PCs) increased only in response to metal exposure. The increase in glutathione content
is consistent with increases in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on viral
lysis, while increases in PC content are likely linked to metal homeostasis and indicate that
metal toxicity to the host was not affected by viral infection. We propose that Cu prevents
lytic production of EhV86 by interfering with virus DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) synthesis
through a transcriptional block, which ultimately suppresses the formation of ROS.

INTRODUCTION
Viruses have been shown to be the most ubiquitous biological
entities detected in the ocean to date (Bergh et al., 1989; Sandaa,
2008), with over a quarter of organic carbon in the sea passing
through the “viral shunt” (Wilhelm and Suttle, 1999). Viruses not
only directly affect the abundance and diversity of the organisms
they infect (e.g., Sorensen et al., 2009), but viral lyses results in the
release of nutrients and organic carbon and thus inﬂuences the
biogeochemical cycles of key elements such as carbon, nitrogen,
and iron (Fe; Gobler et al., 1997; Mioni et al., 2005; Weinbauer
et al., 2009). Therefore viruses are important players in global
ecosystems (Suttle, 2007). The relationship between virus and host
in the marine environment is thought to be complex, however the
Emiliania huxleyi – EhV host–virus system has emerged as one of
the best model systems to investigate algal host–virus interactions
(Bidle and Vardi, 2011).

EhV86, a Coccolithovirus, is responsible for the termination
of naturally occurring blooms of the coccolithophore E. huxleyi
(Schroeder et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2002). More recently, studies
into the mechanisms of EhV86 infection have revealed an animal-
like infection strategy (Mackinder et al., 2009), exploiting pathways
previously thought to be restricted to higher multicellular organ-
isms. These pathways include the synthesis of ceramide (Wilson
et al., 2005; Han et al., 2006) inducing programmed cell death

(PCD) in the unicellular coccolithophore (Bidle and Falkowski,
2004; Pagarete et al., 2009; Vardi et al., 2009). Notably, viral lysis
of E. huxleyi by EhV86 also triggers the production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS; Evans et al., 2006), which in turn induces
caspase activity and consequently PCD (Bidle et al., 2007).

Cellular processes in micro-organisms are also strongly inﬂu-
enced by the chemistry of trace metals, which in turn inﬂuence
the primary production and community structure in the ocean
(Sunda, 1988; Morel and Price, 2003). Copper (Cu) and cadmium
(Cd) are two trace metals that can be found at elevated levels
in coastal environments (e.g., Braungardt et al., 2007). Copper is
an essential cofactor of enzymes involved in a variety of physi-
ological processes including respiration, photosynthesis, oxygen
transport, and antioxidant defense. Therefore, Cu is required for
growth by marine phytoplankton, but is toxic at elevated concen-
trations (Morel et al., 1978; Brand et al., 1986; Gledhill et al., 1997).
Copper predominantly occurs as Cu(II) but biological systems uti-
lize the ability of Cu to undergo a redox cycle. It is this property that
gives Cu its toxic potential. Copper catalyzes the reaction between
superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, producing the highly reactive
hydroxyl radical via the following cycle:
Cu2 + + O

→ Cu + + O2

The reaction with hydrogen peroxide will compete with the

so that the production of the hydroxide radical will be inﬂuenced
by the ambient redox environment (which is reducing within cells;
Schafer and Buettner, 2001) and the relative concentrations of Cu
and superoxide.

Hydroxyl radicals can cause oxidative damage to cellular com-
ponents such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), proteins, and lipids.
For example, Cu causes damage to DNA by binding near guanine
bases, where it is reduced to Cu(I) and then reoxidized to Cu(II)
by reaction with hydrogen peroxide producing hydroxyl radicals.
The radicals then mediate DNA strand breakage in close proximity
to the bound Cu (Sagripanti and Kraemer, 1989; Aruoma et al.,
1991). The redox properties of Cu also allow the metal to bind
to several types of amino acid residues and therefore Cu could
be inappropriately incorporated into proteins and enzymes that
normally bind other metal ions. This results in a loss of func-
tion through inactivation or changes in conformational fold. In
humans for example, Cu may contribute to the development of
Alzheimer’s disease, along with Fe and zinc (Zn), as it has been
found to induce aggregation of the β-amyloid (Aβ) protein and
has been found in high quantities (0.44 mM) in Alzheimer plaques
(Lovell et al., 1998; Curtain et al., 2001). Moreover, these high Cu
levels are linked to an increase in oxidative stress which plays a
central role in neurodegenerative disorders (Permyakov, 2009).

Copper has long been known to possess antimicrobial and
antiviral properties, and in the last decade studies have suggested
that Cu surfaces could be reintroduced into hospitals to reduce
the transmission of microbes such as methicillin resistant Staphy-
lococcus aureus (Noyce et al., 2006a), Escherichia coli O157 (Noyce
et al., 2006b), and inﬂuenza A virus (Noyce et al., 2007). The mech-
anisms of Cu disruption of virus infection may vary depending
on the virus and have yet to be fully understood (Karlstrom and
Levine, 1991a,b; Sagripanti et al., 1997; Horie et al., 2008), how-
ever there is some evidence to suggest that inactivation of viruses
can proceed via Cu mediated DNA damage as described above
(Levinson et al., 1973; Sagripanti et al., 1997).

Cadmium (Cd) had been considered a non-essential metal, but
more recently a unique biological role for Cd has been identiﬁed
in marine diatoms. It has been shown that Cd can replace Zn as
a metal of the Zn carbonic anhydrase (Price and Morel, 1990),
and that Cd carbonic anhydrases can play a role in the acquisition
of inorganic carbon for photosynthesis in the oceans (Lane et al.,
2005). High levels of anthropogenic Cd in the coastal environment
has also led to toxicological effects in exposed marine organisms.
For example, Cd is reported to reduce reproduction rates in phy-
toplankton (Brand et al., 1986). The mechanism of Cd toxicity is
known in animal systems where Cd complexes glutathione (GSH)
and protein-bound sulfhydryl groups, resulting in enhanced pro-
duction of ROS such as superoxide ion, hydroxyl radicals, and
hydrogen peroxide (Stohs et al., 2001). Cadmium has been shown
to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismu-
tase (Cu/Zn-SOD) from rat liver (Hussain et al., 1987) and human

Cu/Zn-SOD (Huang et al., 2006). This occurs through replace-
ment of the normally bound Zn(II) ion with a Cd(II) ion at the
active site.

Elevated Cu and Cd concentrations in many marine eukary-
otic phytoplankton are tolerated through the induction of phy-
tochelatins, thiols of the general formula (γ-Glu-Cys)n-Gly, where
n commonly ranges between 2 and 4 (Ahner and Morel, 1995;
Ahner et al., 1995; Kawakami et al., 2006b,c; Devez et al., 2009).
Phytochelatins and other thiols may also be released into the sur-
rounding media, reducing free metal concentrations, and poten-
tially affecting metal bioavailability (Lee et al., 1996; Leal et al.,
1999; Vasconcelos and Leal, 2001; Vasconcelos et al., 2002). Phy-
tochelatins are synthesized from GSH, which is also known to
respond to oxidative stress. However, while the intracellular abun-
dance of PCs is thought to be linked to metal concentrations in the
surrounding water (e.g., Ahner and Morel, 1995; Ahner et al., 1995;
Morelli and Scarano, 2001; Dupont and Ahner, 2005; Le Faucheur
et al., 2005; Kawakami et al., 2006b; Pawlik-Skowronska et al.,
2007; Morelli and Fantozzi, 2008; Devez et al., 2009), cellular GSH
abundance, and metal concentrations are not necessarily directly
related (Kawakami et al., 2006c; Scheidegger et al., 2011). Glu-
tathione has many metabolic roles (Mendoza-Cozatl et al., 2005),
however, exogenous GSH is known to affect replication of Herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by interfering with the very late stages
of the virus life cycle, without otherwise affecting host cellular
metabolism (Palamara et al., 1995).

Metals thus have the potential to impact host–virus interac-
tions. However, to our knowledge, the effects of metals have not
yet been assessed for any marine host–virus system. The aim of
this study was therefore to undertake a preliminary investigation
into interactions between trace metals and the E. huxleyi – EhV86
system. We subsequently examined (1) the impact of elevated Cu
and Cd concentrations on the EhV86 lytic cycle and (2) the cellular
mechanism involved in these interactions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sterile trace metal clean techniques were used for culturing. Glass-
ware and polycarbonate bottles (Nalgene) were acid washed (1 M
HCl) for at least 24 h prior to use, 4 L polycarbonate culture vessels
(Nalgene) were double bagged (Nalgene autoclavable plastic bags)
prior to autoclaving at 120˚C for 30 min.

CULTURE CONDITIONS
Emiliania huxleyi (strain CCMP 1516) was obtained from the
Provasoli-Guillard Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplank-
ton (CCMP). Experiments reported here focused on acute short
term (4 days) effects. E. huxleyi was batch cultured in f/2 minus
Si medium prepared using 0.2 μm ﬁltered seawater collected
from the North Atlantic Gyre in the Canary Basin (between
24.1 and 29.5˚N and 23.4 and 27.6˚W). The culture medium
(pH= 7.8± 0.1) was allowed to equilibrate overnight and then ﬁl-
tered sterilized (0.2 μm, Sartorius) prior to seeding with E. huxleyi.
Although it was possible that viruses already present in the seawa-
ter would have passed through the 0.2-μm ﬁlter, in practice we did
not observed any evidence of lysis of E. huxleyi in our control cul-
tures, indicating that this was not a problem in these experiments.

(NaH2PO4) added to the seawater were 3× 10

respectively. Concentrations of trace metals added to the sea-
water were 10 nM Cu, 100 nM molybdenum, 4 nM Zn, 2.5 nM
cobalt (Co), 23 nM manganese, 450 nM Fe, and 10 nM selenium.
Media used for initial experiments with 2.5 μM added Cd, Co,
Cu, and Zn were carried out in the presence of 5 μM ethylene-
diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Experiments with different Cu
concentrations were carried out in the presence and absence of
5 μM EDTA, and experiments investigating thiol production and
RNA expression were carried out in the absence of EDTA. Cultures
were maintained at 15± 1˚C under a light/dark cycle of 12:12 h
−1 in a growth
and at an illumination of 150 μmol photons m
cabinet (MLR-350, Sanyo).

VIRUS CULTURE MAINTENANCE
The Coccolithovirus EhV86 was propagated by using acclimated
and synchronized batch cultures of E. huxleyi 1516 grown in f/2
medium without EDTA and Si (Schroeder et al., 2002). The occur-
rence of lysis was generally indicated by a change in the culture
appearance, from a green to a chalky white color. The new virus
stock solution was obtained from an E. huxleyi culture grown to a
cell density of approximately 1× 106 cells mL
−1 at a multiplicity
of infection of approximately 10. The new virus stock solution was
labeled and stored in the dark at 4˚C until required.

METAL AND VIRUS ADDITION
The virus and the single studied metal (Cd, Co, Cu, Zn) were added
simultaneously. The addition of EhV86 virus, in excess for infec-
tion, was done to exponentially growing E. huxleyi host cultures
approximately 4 days after subculturing. In initial experiments
investigating effects of Cd, Co, Cu, and Zn, metals were added
at a concentration of 2.5 μM in excess of concentrations already
present in the media. A second experiment investigated a range
of Cu concentrations between 125 nM and 1 μM. For the ﬁnal
experiment investigating the mechanism of the Cu virus interac-
tion, Cu was added at a total concentration of 1.25 μM and Cd at
5.0 μM. Non-infected cultures with and without metal were used
as a control in parallel for each virus/metal treatment.

Growth of the cultures was monitored daily by enumerating
cells (Multisizer™ II coulter counter). Cell numbers were used to
guide subsequent sampling frequency for PCs and viral ribonu-
cleic acid (RNA). Cultures were sampled daily for virus counts and
on alternate days for thiol content. RNA expression was sampled
on days 5, 7, and 10 post infection for Cu and daily up to day
8 post infection for Cd. All analyses were carried out in dupli-
cate. For virus counts, 1 mL was sampled and ﬁxed using 50 μL
of polyoxymethylene (paraformaldehyde, Sigma Aldrich, 1% ﬁnal
concentration) and subsequently stored at−80˚C for later analysis
by ﬂow cytometry. For thiol analysis, 500 mL of culture solution
was ﬁltered (0.45 μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane ﬁlters,
Whatman) under gentle vacuum pressure and stored at−80˚C. For
isolation of RNA, E. huxleyi cells were harvested via centrifugation
and RNA was extracted from the pellets using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA
was DNase treated (Promega) to remove any DNA contamination
and then quantiﬁed using the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientiﬁc).

Cell counts from the coulter counter were used to calculate the
average growth (μ) rates for E. huxleyi over the period of viral
infection from the slope of a graph of ln(cells) against time. The
viral lysis rate is then calculated from

μ+virus = μ − γlysis
where γlysis is the E. huxleyi lysis rate, μ is the growth rate of E. hux-
leyi in control cultures or treatments containing the added metal,
and μ+virus is the growth rate of E. huxleyi in infected cultures or
infected cultures containing the added metal.

FLOW CYTOMETRY
Determination of the abundance of viral particles and E. huxleyi
cells was performed simultaneously (FACSort, Becton Dickinson
Biosciences). EhV86 were discriminated based on their green ﬂu-
orescence and side scatter. E. huxleyi cells were counted based on
their red and orange ﬂuorescence signatures upon staining with
SYBR Green I DNA dye (Schroeder et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2002).
Comparison of fresh (coulter counter) and ﬁxed (Flow Cytom-
etry) E. huxleyi cell counts showed that a good agreement was
observed between these two counting approaches (t test, p > 0.05,
n = 48).
DETERMINATION OF PARTICULATE THIOLS
The total concentrations of glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatins
(PCs) in metal and virus exposed E. huxleyi cultures were deter-
mined according to the method reported by Kawakami et al.
(2006a). Intracellular thiol measurements were performed in
duplicate by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (HPLC) with ﬂuorescence detection.

Thiols were extracted on ice (5 min), following addition of
1.2 mL solution of 0.1 M HCl containing 5 mM diethylenetriamine
pentaacetic acid (DTPA, Fluka Biochemica) to a 2-mL microcen-
trifuge tube (Fisher) containing the ﬁlter with E. huxleyi biomass.
The extract was centrifuged (13000 g/20 min at 4˚C) and syringe
ﬁltered (0.2 μm pore size cellulose membrane, Minisart RC4,
Sartorius) prior to reduction (25 μL of a 20-mM 2-carboxyethyl-
phosphine hydrochloride, 5 min, TCEP, Sigma). Further oxidation
was minimized (5 mM DTPA) and the extract was buffered at pH
8.2 (200 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N
-2-ethanesulphonic
acid, HEPES). After a further 5 min, 10 μL of a 100-mM of a sulfur-
speciﬁc ﬂuorescent tag monobromobimane was added (MBrB in
acetonitrile, Fisher) followed by 465 μL of the HEPES/DTPA pH
8.2 solution. The derivatization procedure was carried out in a dark
room under dim red light conditions. After 15 min, the reaction
was stabilized and the derivatization of thiols by MBrB, stopped
by addition of 100 μL of 1 M methanesulfonic acid (99%, Sigma).
Vials were stored in the dark at 4˚C until HPLC analysis.

(cid:3)

Thiols were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC with ﬂuorescence
detection (Kawakami et al., 2006a). The HPLC comprised a sys-
tem controller (Shimadzu SCL-10A) and two pumps (Shimadzu
LC-10ADvp), an autosampler (Shimadzu SIL-10ADVP) and a ﬂu-
orescence detector (Shimadzu RF-10A XL) operating at 380 nm
(excitation) and 470 nm (emission) wavelengths. Separation of
the thiols was carried out using a 150 mm× 2.1 mm C-18 HPLC
column (Ascentis, Supelco) with a 3-μm particle size and a gradi-
ent program of 0–5 min, 10% B; 5–18 min, 10–22% B; 18–40 min,

ﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA, Fluka) and B was acetonitrile. The ﬂow
rate was 0.2 mL min

−1.

Phytochelatin concentrations were standardized with GSH
(reduced form, purity 99%, Sigma) assuming that the ﬂuores-
cence response was directly proportional to the number of thiol
groups (Kawakami et al., 2006a). We used PCs directly produced by
Phaeodactylum tricornutum under metal stress for identiﬁcation
of retention times for PC2, PC3, and PC4. GSH eluted at 11.4 min
and PC2, 3, and 4 at 18.8, 21.7, and 24.2 min, respectively. Cellular
GSH and PC concentrations were normalized to the number of
−1. The limit of detec-
cells and are thus expressed in amol SH cell
tion, calculated from three times SD of a 5-pmol GSH standard,
was 0.1 pmol with a 100-μL injection volume. Analytical variabil-
ity within standards and samples was less than 10%. The recovery
of GSH added to samples prior to derivatization was determined
to be 86± 29% (n = 11).

ONE-STEP REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION-PCR
RT-PCR detection of virus-related gene expression was under-
taken using primers designed to amplify four viral genes, DNA
polymerase (DNA pol), Helicase, proliferating cell nuclear anti-
gen (PCNA) protein, and major capsid protein (MCP; Table 1).
One-step RT-PCR was used to amplify 10 ng RNA in 25 μL reac-
tions containing 1× One-step sensimix QPCR mix (with SYBR
green), 7.5 pmol forward primer, 7.5 pmol reverse primer, and
5 units RNase inhibitor. Reactions were carried out in a Rotor-
gene 6000 QPCR machine (Corbett Research) using the following
conditions: reverse transcription at 49˚C for 10 min, polymerase
activation at 95˚C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95˚C for 15 s,
54˚C for 15 s (60˚C for MCP), and 72˚C for 15 s. Fluorescence was
acquired at the end of each extension step on the green channel.
RT-PCR reactions were subjected to melt curve analysis to ensure
a single product had been generated by gradual melting from 72
to 95˚C and ﬂuorescence acquisition at each 1˚C increment. RT-
PCR products were veriﬁed by gel electrophoresis on a 2% (w/v)
agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer and viewed on a UV transilluminator
(Syngene).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
As analysis was only performed in duplicate, estimates of errors
in growth, and lysis rates were calculated from the square route
of the sum of squares of the SEs of the slopes of ln(cells) against

time. The lack of experimental replication meant that the statisti-
cal signiﬁcance of our results could not be tested and comparisons
between treatments are thus qualitative.

RESULTS
E. HUXLEYI – EhV86 INFECTION DYNAMICS IN THE PRESENCE OF
VARIOUS METAL IONS
Preliminary experiments, carried out with a range of metals (Cu,
Zn, Co, and Cd) on the E. huxleyi – EhV86 host–virus system
indicated that viral lysis of E. huxleyi cells was disrupted in the
presence of Cu, but was similar to controls for the metals Cd,
Co, and Zn (Figure 1A). In this study we have interpreted our
data qualitatively as lack of sufﬁcient replicates in our experimen-
tal design precludes more quantitative estimates of the statistical
signiﬁcance of our results. However, Cu was consistently observed
to disrupt viral lysis of E. huxleyi in all the experiments under-
taken as part of this study. Furthermore varying the concentration
of Cu in the absence and presence of EDTA indicated that viral
lysis rates decreased with increasing Cu concentration and were
lowest in the absence of EDTA (Figure 1D). Copper is known to
be toxic to marine algae at high concentrations (e.g., Sunda and
Guillard, 1976; Brand et al., 1986; Gledhill et al., 1997; Levy et al.,
2007, 2008; Debelius et al., 2009), and indeed the growth rate of E.
huxleyi was reduced at the highest Cu concentration when com-
pared to control cultures (Figures 1A,C). However the cumulative
effect of metal plus virus on host growth was only observed in
Cu treatments and thus appeared to be a speciﬁc effect of Cu.
Further short term exposure experiments aimed at understanding
the interaction between Cu and the E. huxleyi virus–host system
focused on Cd and Cu as these two metals are both known to
be toxic and they exhibited contrasting behaviors in our prelim-
inary experiments. Furthermore EDTA was omitted in order to
maximize the effect of trace metals on both host and virus.

PRODUCTION OF GLUTATHIONE AND PHYTOCHELATINS BY E. HUXLEYI
The intracellular content of GSH and PCs in infected and non-
infected E. huxleyi cells were determined in order to investigate
oxidative stress and trace metal homeostasis during the course of
the experiments. Post virus and metal addition growth curves for
E. huxleyi in the thiol expression experiments are presented in
Figure 2. Initial cell numbers were different for each experiment
when virus and metals were added (4.0± 0.6× 105 cells mL
−1
for the Cu experiment and 1.4± 0.2× 105 cells mL
−1 for the Cd
experiment), however, calculated growth rates were similar for

the controls in each experiment for the post infection period and
reﬂected results observed in preliminary experiments (Figure 1).
Cellular GSH concentrations (Figure 3) were 66± 10 amol cell
−1
on day 0 for the Cu experiment and 120± 20 amol cell
−1 for
the Cd experiment and are similar to those reported previ-
ously for E. huxleyi and marine phytoplankton (Ahner et al.,
1995; Kawakami et al., 2006c). Cellular GSH content increased
in the infected treatments (Figure 3). For the Cu experiment,
GSH remained similar in both Cu and +Cu+ Virus treatments,
while in the Cd experiment, cellular GSH levels in the Cd
treatment were similar to the control, while levels increased
in the +Cd+ Virus treatment (Figure 3). A previous study
on infected E. huxleyi cells indicated an increased intracel-
lular occurrence of ROS and oxidative stress (Evans et al.,
2006). The increase in GSH in virus infected cells in this study
is consistent with a response to increased oxidative stress on
viral infection. Glutathione content in the +Cd+ Virus treat-
ment increased to an average of 216± 11 amol cell
−1 between
days 4 and 6 after infection and was closer to that of the
virus treatment (316± 27 amol cell
−1) than the Cd treatment
(46± 29 amol cell
−1). In con-
trast the cellular GSH content of the +Cu+ Virus treatment
was 55± 16 amol cell
−1, similar to that of the Cu treatment

(124± 85 amol cell

GSH variability in this treatment and the difference between the
virus treatment and the control was not as marked as for the Cd
experiment (Figure 3). These results indicate that the ROS event
associated with viral infection is reduced by Cu.

Phytochelatin concentrations increased after addition of both
Cu and Cd (Figure 4). Virus treatments showed only a slight
increase in PC concentrations, although the small E. huxleyi bio-
volume in these treatments resulted in very low absolute PC
concentrations and the calculated errors are likely underestimated.
Cellular phytochelatin concentrations were higher in the Cd and
+Cd+ Virus treatments than in the Cu or +Cu+ Virus treat-
ments. Thus in contrast to the cellular GSH content, PC concen-
trations were observed to vary with metal treatment and not with
infection of E. huxleyi by EhV86.

EXPRESSION OF VIRUS-RELATED RNA
In order to conﬁrm the presence of EhV86 within Cu and Cd
exposed E. huxleyi cells and to determine whether EhV86 was
transcriptionally active when exposed to elevated levels of Cu and
Cd, RT-PCR on four EhV86 encoded genes – DNA dependent
DNA pol – ehv030, PCNA protein – ehv440, Helicase – ehv104
and MCP – ehv085 – was carried out in duplicate before and after
treatment (Tables 2 and 3). Particulate material from Cu and Cd
experiments in the absence of virus were also analyzed and viral
RNA was not detected in any treatment not infected with the virus
(Tables 2 and 3). Genomic studies have previously revealed that all
four genes are required for successful infection (Wilson et al., 2005;
Allen et al., 2006). DNA pol and helicase are required for DNA
synthesis and therefore virus replication. The MCP is required
for virion assembly and PCNA is known to be involved in several
metabolic pathways, including Okazaki fragment processing, DNA
repair, translesion DNA synthesis, DNA methylation, chromatin
remodeling, and cell cycle regulation. PCNA in mammalian cells

appears to play a key role in controlling several reactions through
the coordination and organization of different partner proteins
(Maga and Hubscher, 2003). DNA pol, helicase, and PCNA genes
have been found to be expressed at around 2 h post infection,
while MCP was only ﬁrst detected 4 h post infection (Allen et al.,
2006). We found that Cd had no observable effect on the tran-
scription of all four genes (Table 3), consistent with observations
of virus synthesis and culture lysis (Figures 3 and 4). However, in
the presence of Cu, only PCNA, and MCP genes were expressed.
These results show that Cu did not therefore prevent virus entry
into E. huxleyi cells. However, viral replication within E. huxleyi
appears to have been reduced by Cu via an unknown mechanism
of transcriptional control.

DISCUSSION
Our experiments indicated that metals have a direct effect on
virus production and consequently infection success in the E.

huxleyi – EhV86 system. Furthermore it appears that the effect
is stronger for Cu than for Cd, Zn, and Co so that Cu caused
a reduction in lytic infection in short term exposure exper-
iments at high concentrations of total Cu (> approximately
500 nM). Although these concentrations are higher than com-
monly observed in the marine environment, such high concen-
trations have been recorded in contaminated estuarine systems
(Braungardt et al., 2007). Furthermore, these experiments repre-
sented an acute exposure to high concentrations of metal. Fur-
ther investigations are thus required in order to assess effects of
long-term metal exposure.

The mechanism of the interaction between Cu and the E. hux-
leyi – EhV86 system is currently unknown. Our observations are
summarized in Figure 5. Our data show that EhV86 did not have
an impact on the production of PCs in E. huxleyi and thus was
unlikely to have affected the toxicity of Cu to the host. The pri-
mary effect of Cu on the lytic cycle of EhV86 thus appears to
result from greater sensitivity of the virus to Cu toxicity relative to
the host. Viruses require metals for the functioning of their DNA
and RNA replication enzymes, so it has been previously suggested
that viral inactivation by Cu involves cleavage or damage of viral
DNA or RNA (Sagripanti et al., 1997). Recent studies have linked

and furthermore, RNA transcripts for both PCNA and MCP were
detected. The lack of DNA pol and helicase transcripts indicates
that a speciﬁc mechanism of Cu inhibition was at play. DNA pol
and helicase are both associated with DNA synthesis and replica-
tion, hence it appears that Cu disrupted virus replication within
the host cell, although further work is needed to identify whether
this is a result of exposure of the virus to elevated free Cu within
the host cell or in the media prior to entry into the host. How-
ever since neither MCP or PCNA are affected, we hypothesize that
virion assembly, DNA repair, and other cellular functions associ-
ated with PCNA were not regulated at the transcriptional level by
Cu. Thus, despite being involved in DNA replication and repair,
viral PCNA was not regulated in the same way as dedicated DNA
replicative enzymes, DNA pol, and helicase. It is interesting to note
that both DNA pol and helicase encode for magnesium contain-
ing proteins, while PCNA and MCP do not, although whether
this factor might inﬂuence the inhibition of transcription of the
associated RNA is unclear. Intracellular free Cu concentrations
in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are generally thought to be tightly
controlled, with Cu being buffered within the cell by thiols and
chaperoned into Cu containing enzymes (Robinson and Winge,
2010; Rae et al., 1999). The intravirion behavior of metals how-
ever is less well known, but our studies indicate that EhV86 may
be less able to regulate Cu. Previous studies on the effects of Cu
on the transcriptional control of genes have indicated regulation
of Cu is achieved by modulating the transcription of genes encod-
ing proteins directly involved in Cu binding. Transcription of the
Ctr1/3 and Fre1 genes are regulated by the DNA-binding protein
Mac1 (Yamaguchi-Iwai et al., 1997). During Cu starvation, Mac1
binds to DNA initiating transcription. However, in Cu replete con-
ditions, Jensen and Winge (1998) demonstrated that Cu ions bind
to the protein, initiating a conformational change which inhibits
transcription. Transcriptional regulation of these Cu uptake genes

Metals, EhV86, and Emiliania huxleyi

FIGURE 5 | Schematic of the interactive effect of Cu on the infection
cycle of EhV86. (A) Simpliﬁed schematic of the normal infection cycle of
EhV86 (after Mackinder et al., 2009). The virion particle (blue hexagon)
enters the cell and targets the nucleus where it releases the viral genome.
Viral genes are transcribed (red) ﬁrst by host RNA polymerase in the
nucleus and then by viral RNA polymerase in the cytoplasm. Virus DNA
replication (orange) also takes place in the nucleus, while the capsid is
assembled in the cytoplasm and released via a budding mechanism.

Cellular glutathione (GSH) increases (green arrow) as a result of reactive
oxygen species generation, which occurs during capsid assembly. (B)
Copper down-regulates (green arrow) the infection cycle prior to capsid
assembly via transcriptional control of speciﬁc viral RNA. Cellular
phytochelatin concentrations (PCs) increase in response to elevated
copper concentrations, but GSH concentrations are similar to those in
uninfected cells as capsid assembly is highly reduced. The ultimate result
is a reduction in virus production.

has therefore been linked directly to cellular Cu concentrations
(Graden and Winge, 1997).

The second observed effect of Cu in our study was on par-
ticulate GSH concentrations, which were similar to controls in
infected E. huxleyi cells in the presence of Cu, but increased in
E. huxleyi cells undergoing lysis, even when the concentrations of
phytochelatins were higher (Figure 3). These results indicate that
GSH, known to mitigate against ROS, is produced by the host when
the virus replicates probably as a result of the viral induction of
the hosts ceramide and apoptosis pathways (Schwarz, 1996; Stohs
et al., 2001; Wilson et al., 2005; Bidle et al., 2007; Vardi et al., 2009).
Moreover, GSH can also directly interfere with virus replication,
mainly at the late stages of virion assembly (Palamara et al., 1995).
Therefore, in our Cu exposed virus treatments, GSH production
decreased when compared to virus treatments because the virus
was unable to complete its replication and infection cycle and GSH
was thus not induced to the same extent in the host.

To the authors knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of an inter-
action occurring between metals, virus, and host in a marine
system. We have identiﬁed a speciﬁc interaction between Cu, E.
huxleyi and its virus EhV86, however, further work is necessary

in order to understand the mechanism involved in this interac-
tion. Concentrations of Cu required to initiate the inhibitory effect
on virus replication and virion synthesis were found to be com-
parable to those observed in highly Cu contaminated estuaries
(Braungardt et al., 2007). However the study focused on short
term acute exposure to Cu. It is currently unknown if any effects
would be observed on long-term exposure to lower concentra-
tions. However, the increased use of Cu-based antifouling paints in
marine systems (Schiff et al., 2004; Singh and Turner, 2009a,b) and
the importance of phytoplankton communities in underpinning
global climate control (Richardson and Schoeman, 2004; Bouvy
et al., 2011) highlights the need to understand such mechanisms.
The immediate medical beneﬁt that can be had by fully charac-
terizing the Cu inhibitory effort on the E. huxleyi – EhV86 model
system for developing antiviral drugs and protocols against animal
virus infections should also be considered.
