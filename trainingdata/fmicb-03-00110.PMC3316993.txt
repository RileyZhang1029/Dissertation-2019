CTX-M β-lactamases are considered a paradigm in the evolution of a resistance mecha-
nism. Incorporation of different chromosomal blaCTX-M related genes from different species
of Kluyvera has derived in different CTX-M clusters. In silico analyses have shown that
this event has occurred at least nine times; in CTX-M-1 cluster (3), CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-
9 clusters (2 each), and CTX-M-8 and CTX-M-25 clusters (1 each). This has been mainly
produced by the participation of genetic mobilization units such as insertion sequences
(ISEcp1 or ISCR1) and the later incorporation in hierarchical structures associated with
multifaceted genetic structures including complex class 1 integrons and transposons. The
capture of these blaCTX-M genes from the environment by highly mobilizable structures
could have been a random event. Moreover, after incorporation within these structures,
β-lactam selective force such as that exerted by cefotaxime and ceftazidime has fueled
mutational events underscoring diversiﬁcation of different clusters. Nevertheless, more
variants of CTX-M enzymes, including those not inhibited by β-lactamase inhibitors such
as clavulanic acid (IR-CTX-M variants), only obtained under in in vitro experiments, are still
waiting to emerge in the clinical setting. Penetration and the later global spread of CTX-M
producing organisms have been produced with the participation of the so-called “epidemic
resistance plasmids” often carried in multi-drug resistant and virulent high-risk clones. All
these facts but also the incorporation and co-selection of emerging resistance determi-
nants within CTX-M producing bacteria, such as those encoding carbapenemases, depict
the currently complex pandemic scenario of multi-drug resistant isolates.

INTRODUCTION
Antibiotic resistance is a topic in continuous review and the several
studies published every year with new data can modify or redeﬁne
our perspective about this problem. β-lactam resistance and par-
ticularly overviews about β-lactamases, enzymes able to hydrolyze
β-lactam antibiotics, have undoubtedly been the most frequently
studied topics in this ﬁeld. β-lactams, the antibiotics most widely
used all over the world, have also given rise to a continuous increase
of resistant isolates due to their permanent selective force driving
diversiﬁcation of the resistance mechanisms.

β-Lactamases have been studied from many different aspects,
including classiﬁcation, hydrolytic proﬁles and kinetic proper-
ties, plasticity, frequency, and dissemination. Moreover they have
been used as an example of the accelerated evolution follow-
ing the Darwinian paradigm, where the strong antibiotic selec-
tive pressure favors the survival of the most adapted. According
to a recent review fromDavies and Davies (2010), a dramatic
increase in the number of β-lactamases has been described since
the 1980s of the last century but this increase is due almost
exclusively to class A and D β-lactamases (Bush and Jacoby,
2010). Among the class A β-lactamases, the extended-spectrum
β-lactamases (ESBLs) which are able to hydrolyze expanded-
spectrum cephalosporins (such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cef-
tazidime, or cefepime) and monobactams (aztreonam) represent

a public health concern (Coque et al., 2008a; Pitout and Laup-
land, 2008). ESBLs of class A mainly include TEM, SHV, CTX-M,
VEB, and GES enzymes. Among them, the highest number of
variants described in the last years corresponds to the CTX-M
family (123 variants until 2011, last accession December 5, 2011)1.
This explosive dissemination of CTX-Ms around the world has
been referred as the “CTX-M pandemic” due to their increas-
ing description worldwide (Cantón and Coque, 2006). Although
different updates about CTX-M β-lactamases have been pub-
lished (Bonnet, 2004; Livermore et al., 2007; Rossolini et al.,
2008; Hawkey and Jones, 2009; Naseer and Sundsfjord, 2011), new
data about dispersion and clonality of CTX-M producing isolates,
molecular epidemiology, protein plasticity, evolution and origin
of the blaCTX-M genes, inﬂuence of antibiotic use, and patients
risk factors, justify this new review. Figure 1 illustrates differ-
ent factors fueling the emergence, maintenance, and spread of
the CTX-M ESBLs. We will focus our attention on the epidemi-
ology, origin and evolution of blaCTX-M genes, and inﬂuence of
surrounding genetic structures participating in the maintenance
and spread of these genes and hence organisms producing CTX-M
enzymes.

2011). In addition, they are generally susceptible to β-lactamase
inhibitors such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam.
Mainly, they are included in the 2be Bush-Jacoby and Medeiros
functional group belonging to the molecular class A β-lactamases
from the Ambler’s classiﬁcation (Ambler, 1980; Bush et al., 1995;
Bush and Jacoby, 2010). Enzymes showing an “ESBL phenotype”
have been mainly described in TEM-, SHV-, CTX-M, GES, and
VEB families into class A β-lactamases, and OXA-ESBLs into class
D β-lactamases (Paterson and Bonomo, 2005).

The TEM-, SHV-, and OXA-type ESBL enzymes derive from
point mutations from the classical plasmid-mediated enzymes
TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and OXA-10 which are not of greater
importance in hydrolyzing extended-spectrum cephalosporins
(Paterson and Bonomo, 2005; Bush and Jacoby, 2010). The TEM-
and SHV-ESBLs were predominant in the ESBL landscape over
the 1980s and 1990s in the past century, mainly associated with
outbreaks in hospitals involving Klebsiella pneumoniae and to
a lesser extent in Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae
whereas the CTX-M were less prevalent (Bradford, 2001; Paterson
and Bonomo, 2005). Although ﬁrst discovered in 1989 (Bauern-
feind et al., 1990, 1992), the CTX-M enzymes did not reach
prominence over the other ESBL enzymes until the ﬁrst decade
of the 2000s when accelerated evolution and extraordinary dis-
persion of these enzymes were observed (Cantón, 2008). They
were conﬁned not only to the hospital setting but also to the
community, with E. coli being the most important pathogen pro-
ducing these enzymes (Cantón and Coque, 2006; Coque et al.,
2008a).

Unlike other ESBLs, CTX-M family constitutes a complex and
non-homogeneous group of enzymes. The ﬁrst view and align-
ment of the amino acid sequence of the different CTX-M variants
allowed to classify these enzymes in ﬁve clusters but recent pub-
lications report at least two more additional clusters (Bonnet,
2004; Rossolini et al., 2008; see also below). Phylogenetic analy-
ses suggest that CTX-Ms were not originated by mutations from
previous plasmid meditated enzymes but through mobilization
of chromosomal bla genes from Kluyvera spp. when they were
incorporate into mobile genetic elements (Cantón, 2008). These
original mobilized blaCTX-Ms genes affected cefotaxime to a higher
degree than ceftazidime. Nevertheless and from an evolutionary
point of view, CTX-Ms as other ESBLs later diverged by punc-
tual mutations probably as consequence of antibiotic selective
pressure once Kluyvera spp. blaCTX-M genes were mobilized and
were incorporated into mobile genetic elements. This also gave the
CTX-M enzymes the opportunity to enhance the hydrolytic activ-
ity against ceftazidime and a new variants were described (Bonnet,
2004; Poirel et al., 2008).

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CTX-M β-LACTAMASE-PRODUCING
BACTERIA
Studies over the last 10 years have revealed that unlike some excep-
tions, the CTX-M enzymes have nearly displaced other ESBLs
enzymes in Enterobacteriaceae, including TEM and SHV ESBL
variants (Cantón, 2008; Coque et al., 2008a; Angel Díaz et al., 2009;
Hawkey and Jones, 2009; Bush, 2010; Rodriguez-Villalobos et al.,
2011). This displacement might have occurred not only as a conse-
quence of the extraordinary dissemination of the corresponding

the CTX-M extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs).

CLASSIFICATION OF β-LACTAMASES AND CTX-M ENZYMES
β-Lactamases are by far the most important resistant mech-
anisms in Gram-negative bacilli. With the popularization of
molecular techniques, an increasing number of these enzymes
have been characterized differing in amino acid sequences and
hydrolytic activity against β-lactam antibiotics (Bush, 2010). They
are mainly classiﬁed using the Ambler scheme (Ambler, 1980),
which grades to the so-called molecular classes (A through D)
and also currently functional groups which use the characteris-
tic of the enzymes, including their hydrolytic substrate proﬁle,
and response to inhibitors (Bush and Jacoby, 2010). Classically,
genetic location of the corresponding β-lactamase genes (bla)
in plasmids or chromosome was also used to differentiate these
enzymes. Nevertheless, this genetic characteristic is no longer
used, as chromosomal bla genes can be mobilized and inte-
grated into plasmids or transposons, but a reverse situation of
initially describes plasmid-mediated β-lactamases into the chro-
mosome is also increasingly found (Toleman et al., 2006; Coelho
et al., 2010). In addition protein regulation characteristics (i.e.,
constitutive or inducible expression) are also noted when refer-
ring to different β-lactamases groups (Livermore, 1995) but this
trait depends on the surrounding genes. In Gram-negative organ-
isms, inducible expression of β-lactamases is commonly found in
chromosomal β-lactamases whereas plasmid-mediated enzymes
are generally constitutively expressed. Enhancement expression of
their hydrolytic activity is often regulated by promoters present in
upstream genes.

Within the β-lactamases, the ESBLs have been worthy of the
attention of the scientiﬁc community and clinicians over the last
three decades since their ﬁrst description in 1983 (Knothe et al.,
1983). In general, ESBLs are located in plasmids and are char-
acterized for their ability to hydrolyze oxy-imino-cephalosporins
(third and fourth generation cephalosporins) and monobactams
but not cephamycins such as cefoxitin and carbapenems includ-
ing imipenem, ertapenem, meropenem, or doripenem (Philippon
et al., 1989; Jacoby and Muñoz-Price, 2005; Bush and Fisher,

blaCTX-M genes in highly mobilizable genetic platforms, includ-
ing plasmids and transposons, but also because of these platforms
within successful clones (Cantón and Coque, 2006; Rogers et al.,
2011; Woodford et al., 2011; Figure 2). Another reason for this
increase is the co-resistance phenomenon in CTX-M producing
organisms, particularly to aminoglycosides and ﬂuoroquinolones,
which might facilitate co-selection processes (Morosini et al., 2006;
Cantón and Ruiz-Garbajosa, 2011).

Apart from this general overview, within the CTX-M enzymes,
the CTX-M-15, and CTX-M-14 are by far the most important
ones, virtually invading all human and animal compartments
as well as the environment all over the world (Cantón et al.,
2008; Hawkey and Jones, 2009; Dolejska et al., 2011; Hiroi et al.,
2012). Nevertheless, temporal emergence and penetration of these
enzymes in different epidemiological scenarios might also explain
the current epidemiology of CTX-M enzymes. Antibiotic con-
sumption and dissimilar risk factors in different geographic areas
and groups of patients and particularities of different com-
partments might have also contributed to the current CTX-M
scenario (Carattoli, 2008; Rodríguez-Baño and Navarro, 2008;
Rodríguez-Baño and Pascual, 2008; Oteo et al., 2010a; Naseer
and Sundsfjord, 2011). In this sense three different periods of
CTX-M can be differentiated. The ﬁrst one includes emergence
of different CTX-M β-lactamases in different and distant geo-
graphic areas and might have occurred until the mid-1990s of
the last century. The second was characterized by the emergence
of the most widespread CTX-M enzymes, including CTX-M-
3, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-14, and CTX-M-15 enzymes and might
have occurred from 1994 to 2000. Some of these enzymes, but
not exclusively, are variants of previously described CTX-M β-
lactamases. Finally, the third period through 2000 is charac-
terized by the universal dispersion and globalization of these
β-lactamases. The second and third periods will be presented
together bellow.

structures and bacterial clones participating in the mobilization,
spread, and maintenance of these genes (see the text for further
explanation).

THE EMERGENCE OF CTX-M β-LACTAMASES: DIFFERENT CTX-M
ENZYMES IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
The ﬁrst recognition of the emergence of CTX-M β-lactamases
occurred nearly simultaneously in Europe and South America
at the beginning of 1989 (Bauernfeind et al., 1990, 1992). The
ﬁrst publication recognizing an ESBL from the CTX-M group was
that reporting a cefotaxime-resistant but ceftazidime susceptible
E. coli isolate recovered from the ear of a 4-month-old child suf-
fering from otitis media in Munich (Germany; Bauernfeind et al.,
1990). The enzyme responsible for this particular ESBL phenotype
not affecting ceftazidime was named as CTX-M-1 in reference to
its preferential hydrolytic activity against cefotaxime (CTX as its
acronym, -M from Munich). This enzyme inaugurated a group
of enzymes that during the 1990s were also grouped as cefotax-
imases due to their particular phenotypic and hydrolytic proﬁle
(Bonnet, 2004). In South America, the ﬁrst isolates with a “cefotax-
imase pattern”were detected in Salmonella typhimurium recovered
in hospitalized patients suffering from meningitis, septicemia, or
enteritis (Bauernfeind et al., 1992). The enzyme responsible for
this phenotype had a different isoelectric point (pI 7.9) than the
one (pI 8.9) described in Germany and was named as CTX-M-2.
Later sequencing of blaCTX-M-2 gene in 1996 conﬁrmed a different
amino acid sequence of these two enzymes but a shared homology
of 84% (Bauernfeind et al., 1996).

These CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-2 β-lactamases were the ﬁrst
reported CTX-M like enzymes but not chronologically the
enzymes belonging to this group. They were preceded by the
isolation in 1986 of a cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolate recov-
ered from the fecal ﬂora of a laboratory dog which was used for
pharmacokinetic studies of β-lactam antibiotics in Japan (Mat-
sumoto et al., 1988). The enzyme responsible for this phenotype
was named as FEC-1 (Fecal E. coli), which was later recognized
to be related with the CTX-M-3 enzyme initially found in Poland
(Bonnet, 2004). Moreover, and also at the beginning of 1989 but
in France, an E. coli with an identical phenotype was isolated from
a Italian patient (Barthélémy et al., 1992; Bernard et al., 1992).
The β-lactamase, named as MEN-1 (named after the patient in
who it was isolated), was the ﬁrst available sequence of a CTX-
M β-lactamase (Barthélémy et al., 1992). In 1996 sequencing
of both the original CTX-M enzymes, CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-
2, revealed that MEN-1 was identical to CTX-M-1 (Bauernfeind
et al., 1996).

Other CTX-M related β-lactamases that were contemporarily
isolated during the 1990s were Toho-1 and Toho-2 enzymes (Toho
refers to Toho University School of Medicine Omori Hospital in
Tokyo). The former were characterized in a cefotaxime-resistant
E. coli isolate recovered in 1993 from a 1-year-old female child
who developed cystitis in Japan (Ishii et al., 1995) and the latter
also in a cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolate recovered in Japan in
1995 from the urine of a 69-year-old male who suffered from colon
cancer (Ma et al., 1998). Sequence alignment revealed their linkage
with CTX-M-2. Both enzymes were later renamed and designated
as CTX-M-44 (Toho-1) and CTX-M-45 (Toho-2; last accession
December 5, 2011)2

CTX-M enzymes: origin and diffusion

All these earliest descriptions of CTX-M enzymes showed hot
areas for their emergence (Central Europe, South America, and
Japan) that could reﬂect not only speciﬁc selective driving forces
such as antibiotic consumption but also geographic speciﬁcity for
different enzymes that could be related with their presence in spe-
ciﬁc clones or abundance of organism from which they derived
(see below). Unfortunately, clonality of ancestral CTX-M produc-
ing isolates was not performed as well as plasmid characterization.
These studies would have been relevant for tracing the emergence
and dissemination of the ﬁrst CTX-M ESBLs. Moreover, epidemi-
ological surveys including molecular characterization at the end
of the 1980s from other geographic areas, such as South East Asia
that is nowadays relevant for emerging β-lactamases, including
carbapenemases (enzymes that are able to hydrolyze carbapen-
ems), were absent. These would also have been important for
the better understanding of the current dissemination of epi-
demiologically important CTX-Ms that were described through
1994, such as CTX-M-3, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-14, and CTX-15.
Table 1 includes epidemiological data of the earliest descrip-
tions of different CTX-M ESBLs during the 1980s and 1990s.
This data are relevant for understanding current epidemiological
scenario.

PENETRATION AND GLOBALIZATION OF CTX-M ENZYMES ALL OVER
THE WORLD
During the 1990s, different reports showed the appearance nearly
at the same time of the same enzymes in very distant countries,
denoting the potential independent emergence of these enzymes
but also suggesting a rapid dissemination. During these years,
diversiﬁcation was also noted with the ever increasing description
of new CTX-M enzymes from different groups. This has been well
illustrated with CTX-M-3, a closely related enzyme with CTX-M-1
differing in four amino acid positions (V77A, D114N, S140A, and
N288D). This enzyme was detected in E. coli and K. pneumoniae
isolates recovered in 1996–1997 in Poland (Gniadkowski et al.,
1998; Palucha et al., 1999), in 1998 in France (De Champs et al.,
2000; Doucet-Populaire et al., 2000) and in 1999 in Taiwan (Yan
et al., 2000). Unlike genetic determinants harboring blaCTX-M-3
gene which were not sequenced at that time, CTX-M plasmid size
and plasmid restriction patterns showed similarity demonstrat-
ing the potential diffusion of the same plasmids within isolates
obtained from Poland and Taiwan (Yan et al., 2000). Despite
this result, importation of this enzyme to Taiwan from Europe
or vice versa was not possible to rule out as clonality was not
addressed. Nevertheless, in both countries rapid dissemination of
this enzyme was illustrated after its emergence (Baraniak et al.,
2002; Yu et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2005).

Diversiﬁcation of CTX-M-1 cluster was exempliﬁed with
increasing descriptions of new variants over the 1990s. For
instance, CTX-M-10 was mainly described in the Mediterranean
area (Spain and France; Oliver et al., 2001; Leavitt et al., 2009)
and the CTX-M-15, initially identiﬁed in 1999 in enteric iso-
lates recovered from a hospital in New Delhi, India (Karim et al.,
2001), but nowadays found all over the world (Hawkey and
Jones, 2009; Rogers et al., 2011). The CTX-M-10 differs from
CTX-M-3 in two amino acids (A27V and R38Q) whereas CTX-
M-15 in only one amino acid position (D240G). Nevertheless,

diversiﬁcation of CTX-M-3, CTX-M-10, and CTX-M-15 should
have been produced from a common ancestor (Novais et al., 2010).
A similar example is the CTX-M-9 enzyme, which was initially
described in Spain and Brazil in 1996 (Sabaté et al., 2000; Bonnet
et al., 2001), followed by China in 1997 (Chanawong et al., 2002).
A retrospective study performed in France revealed the presence of
this enzyme in strains isolated during 1994 (Saladin et al., 2002).
In Spain, this enzyme became one of the most prevalent ESBL but
co-existing with CTX-M-14 enzyme (a variant of CTX-M-9 dif-
fering in one amino acid, A231V). This enzyme emerged in Korea
in 1995 (Pai et al., 2001) and was rapidly disseminated over the
world. In China, it was detected in 1997–1998 (Chanawong et al.,
2002), in Taiwan in 1998–1999 (Yu et al., 2002), in France in 1999
(Dutour et al., 2002) and in Brazil in 1999 (Bonnet, 2004).

Surveys performed in different countries during that period
revealed that once a CTX-M β-lactamase penetrates in a speciﬁc
geographic area it becomes prevalent with displacement or super-
imposition over TEM and SHV ESBL variants. This was the case of
CTX-M-2 in South America, CTX-M-3 in Poland and CTX-M-14
in Spain, Taiwan and China (Bonnet, 2004; Livermore and Hawkey,
2005). This landscape was also the case for CTX-M-15 in United
Kingdom (Paterson and Bonomo, 2005; Cantón and Coque, 2006;
Hawkey and Jones, 2009). As previously noted, it was ﬁrst iso-
lated in India in 1999 (Karim et al., 2001) but also emerged in the
United Kingdom in 2001 and probably in Japan early in the 2000s
[designated as UOE-1 in GeneBank (accession number AY013478;
Mushtaq et al., 2003; Livermore and Hawkey, 2005)]. Moreover,
in Poland a retrospective study of a collection of Enterobacte-
riaceae resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins revealed
the presence of the CTX-M-15 in Serratia marcescens and E. coli
since 1998 (Baraniak et al., 2002). Interestingly plasmid analy-
sis suggested that this enzyme could have evolved directly from
CTX-M-3 rather than being imported from another country and
independently in different hospitals.

In the United Kingdom, isolation of CTX-M was rare before
2001 and only sporadic cases of CTX-M-9 were described as
well as an important outbreak due to CTX-M-26, a variant of
CTX-M-25 with three amino acid substitutions (V80A, Q225R,
and G242D), which was previously described in Canada (Mun-
day et al., 2004). The CTX-M-15 rapidly disseminated in the
United Kingdom since its ﬁrst detection. Isolates were particu-
larly associated with different E. coli clones, A to F, the ﬁrst one
representing the majority and later identiﬁed as belonging to the
international O25:H4-ST131 clone that has been detected all over
the world (Lau et al., 2008). Again a dramatic increase of CTX-Ms
was demonstrated mainly due to the CTX-M-15 enzymes (Coque
et al., 2008b).

In the United States, CTX-Ms were rare during the 1990s but
increased from 25% in 2000 to nearly 90% in 2005 (Lewis et al.,
2007). Interestingly, CTX-M-15 rapidly penetrated over a minority
of CTX-Ms that include CTX-M-8, CTX-M-14, and CTX-M-16
(Lewis et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2010; Peirano et al., 2010). Within
this country and as in other parts of the world, the CTX-M-15
enzyme has been identiﬁed in hospitalized and extrahospitalary
patients and also in companion animals in which CTX-M-15
was the most prevalent CTX-M enzyme (Castanheira et al., 2008;
Urban et al., 2010; Shaheen et al., 2011).

The model of CTX-M-15 dissemination could have been dif-
ferent in countries in which other CTX-M β-lactamases were well
established prior to the detection and penetration of this enzyme.
This is the case of Spain and South America. In our institution
in Spain, CTX-M-10 was ﬁrst detected in 1990 in K. pneumoniae

and in 1991 in E. coli. The ﬁrst detection of CTX-M-9 was in E.
coli in 1996 and in K. pneumoniae in 1999, CTX-M-14 in 2001
in K. pneumoniae and in E. coli and CTX-M-15 in 2001 in E. coli
and in 2002 in K. pneumoniae. It is of note that in a national
survey in 2000 in Spain involving 40 centers, CTX-M-15 was not

found. However, in 2006 in a similar study, CTX-M-15 was found
in different regions and was one of the most prevalent enzymes
after CTX-M-14 and SHV-12 (Díaz et al., 2010). More recently, in
our institution CTX-M-15 represents 34% of total ESBL produc-
ing E. coli (Novais et al., unpublished data), 37% of CTX-M-14,
and 20% of SHV-12, denoting the increasing prevalence of CTX-
M-15 but still co-existing with other CTX-M enzymes. This data
illustrates that when CTX-M-15 penetrates in a landscape where
other ESBLs are present the increment of this enzyme and dis-
placement of other ESBLs is a slow process. This model can also
be the case of South America where CTX-M-2 has been the most
prevalent CTX-M over years. Nevertheless, reports of CTX-M-
15 producing isolates are increasing in this continent, including
Colombia (Valenzuela de Silva et al., 2006; Ruiz et al., 2011), Brazil
(Cergole-Novella et al., 2010), Uruguay (Bado et al., 2010), and
Peru (Pallecchi et al., 2004, 2007).

At present, we cannot rule out that international travel and
immigration might have contributed during the 1990s and the
early 2000s to the rapid emergence and dissemination of CTX-
M enzymes in different countries and geographic areas. This has
recently been demonstrated with carbapenemases and particu-
larly with the NDM-1 metalo-β-lactamase-producing organisms
(Kumarasamy et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the presence of CTX-
M enzymes in animals and most importantly in uncooked food
products that were transported from one country to another sug-
gests potential routes for dissemination (Matsumoto et al., 2007;
Warren et al., 2008; Dhanji et al., 2010).

Finally, globalization of CTX-M enzymes is illustrated by their
presence not only in food and companion animals but also in wild
animals (Bonnedahl et al., 2010; Literak et al., 2010; Gonçalves
et al., 2011; Silva et al., 2011). Additionally, they have been isolated
in environmental compartments (Chen et al., 2010; Dhanji et al.,
2011a).

CTX-M ENZYMES NOT ONLY IN ENTEROBACTERIACEAE
As previously stated CTX-M enzymes were initially described in
E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Salmonella spp. but rapidly emerged
in other Enterobacteriaceae. This event occurs in bacterial isolates
with chromosomal mechanisms such as inducible chromosomal
AmpC in Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, Citrobacter spp., and
Morganella morganii able to destroy oxy-imino-cephalosporins
(Cantón et al., 2002; Paterson and Bonomo, 2005). This ﬁnd sug-
gests the facility for transmission of blaCTX-M genes and also that
the acquisition of these genes could have lower ﬁtness cost for the
bacteria than selection of derepressed AmpC β-lactamase variants
which ﬁnally also contribute to cephalosporin resistance.

As CTX-M enzymes increased in prevalence in Enterobacteri-
aceae in the early 2000s, they also increased in non-fermentative
Gram-negative bacilli and other non-Enterobacteriaceae species.
The ﬁrst CTX-M enzyme described in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was observed in isolates recov-
ered in 2004 from sputum samples of a cystic ﬁbrosis patient in
Amsterdam (al Naiemi et al., 2006). The CTX-M enzyme from
these isolates was characterized as CTX-M-1. In the same 2004
year, CTX-M-43 (a variant of CTX-M-44 carrying the D240G
change and belonging to the CTX-M-2 group), was also observed
in P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. in isolates recovered from

Bolivian hospitals (Celenza et al., 2006). CTX-M-2 was also found
in a P. aeruginosa isolate recovered in a patient hospitalized in
Brazil in 2005 (Picão et al., 2009). Despite these descriptions,
prevalence of CTX-M enzymes in non-fermenter bacilli is still
rare. This fact could be due to incompatibility of plasmids car-
rying these enzymes or might reﬂect phenotypic difﬁculties in
recognizing non-fermenter isolates expressing CTX-Ms. On the
other hand, Aeromonas spp. or Vibrio spp. isolates with CTX-
M enzymes have been also recognized (Soler Bistué et al., 2006;
Ye et al., 2010; Chowdhury et al., 2011; Gómez-Garcés et al.,
2011).

ORIGIN AND MOBILIZATION OF THE blaCTX-M GENES
According to phylogenetic trees performed with all CTX-M β-
lactamases described, the CTX-M lineage could be differentiated
at in least ﬁve main clusters (Figure 3). Traditionally, each CTX-M
cluster has been related to the chromosomal bla genes present in
different Kluyvera species, which are part of the human normal
intestinal microbiome, usually at low bacterial counts, and is con-
sidered as a saprophytic and an opportunistic pathogen (Farmer
et al., 1981). Furthermore, they have been occasionally isolated in
humans associated with different infections, mainly affecting the
urinary tract and skin and soft tissues (Sarria et al., 2001) and is
also present in the environment as free-living organisms in water,
soil, sewage, and food products of animal origin (Farmer et al.,
1981).

Chromosomal bla gene, kluC, present in Kluyvera cryocre-
scens has been considered the ancestor of the CTX-M-1 cluster
(Decousser et al., 2001), kluA gene from Kluyvera ascorbata the
origin of the CTX-M-2 cluster (Humeniuk et al., 2002) and three
different chromosomal bla genes from Kluyvera georgiana, kluG,
kluY, and blaCTX-M-78 the origin of CTX-M-8 (Poirel et al., 2002),
CTX-M-9 (Olson et al., 2005), and CTX-M-25 clusters (Rodríguez
et al., 2010) respectively. Interestingly, the CTX-M-74 and CTX-
M-75, characterized in a survey conducted in Brazil and with
single one amino acid change with respect to CTX-M-2 (Minar-
ini et al., 2009), showed a degree of nucleotide divergence that
could be considered as a new cluster, reﬂecting a convergent evo-
lution of these β-lactamases (Stepanova et al., 2008). All these data
suggest that the environmental source of CTX-M β-lactamases
was the genus Kluyvera. Although the scientiﬁc community has
unequivocally accepted this point, several questions still arise to
guarantee this line of evidence. First, the comparison of the topolo-
gies of phylogenetic trees between blaCTX-M and available 16S
rDNA sequences of Kluyvera species reveals that the evolutionary
relationships among CTX-M clusters is not completely correlate
with the phylogenetic distance among the different species of
Kluyvera (Figure 3). Whereas all Kluyvera species diversiﬁed at
the same time from the same ancestral bacteria, this topology is
not observed among blaCTX-M clusters, suggesting different evo-
lutionary trajectories. Second, if each chromosomal gene from
Kluyvera was the source of a determined CTX-M cluster, why
have at least three chromosomal genes from K. georgiana (blakluG,
blakluY, and blaCTX-M-78) been proposed as precursor of three
different CTX-M clusters? On the contrary, CTX-M-1 cluster
has been related to different Kluyvera species (K. ascorbata and
K. cryocrescens; Decousser et al., 2001; Rodríguez et al., 2004).

model inferred by jModeltest program and invariant site rate of 77.6%
(HKY+ I+ G). We considered nodes valid when bootstrap value was
>85%. The phylogenetic trees were represented using MEGA 5.0
program.

These data could also suggest that blaCTX-M genes have been also
circulating among different Kluyvera species. Third, upstream of
blaklu gene identical genome organization was found in Enterobac-
ter aerogenes, suggesting that Kluyvera could have gained blaklu
gene after these species diverged, therefore most of the isolates
must carry blaklu gene, including Kluyvera intermedia, where no
blaklu gene has been identiﬁed. However, despite the presence of
the blaklu gene in most Kluyvera isolates, 90% are susceptible
to cefotaxime (Sarria et al., 2001). Obviously, blaklu gene could
be present but weakly expressed. Unfortunately the presence of
blaklu gene in Kluyvera susceptible isolates or their genetic envi-
ronment has not been searched. These studies could help us to
understand previous observations of Kluyvera spp. as the pre-
cursor of the CTX-M enzymes and responsible for the current
pandemic.

It is well known that chromosomal blaklu genes are weakly
expressed in their original context and require the presence of
a strong promoter upstream to increase the MIC values and con-
sequently be considered as phenotypically resistant. The insertion
sequences (IS) have provided this promoter in clinical cefotaxime-
resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains, the most prevalent being
ISEcp1 and ISCR1, while IS26 has been only detected in few
isolates. Curiously, these IS have not been described in natural
isolates of Kluyvera, although the capture of ISEcp1 upstream of
chromosomal blaklu/CTX-M genes occurs at high frequency in lab-
oratory conditions. This was demonstrated in an elegant in vitro
experiment performed by Lartigue et al. (2006). When ISEcp1 was
inserted upstream of blaklu/CTX-M gene, stress situations such as
high temperature (40˚C) or that exerted by antimicrobials such
as ceftazidime or cefotaxime, the mobilization of ISEcp1 was
increased, carrying the downstream sequences. It has been specu-
lated that global warming or higher temperature than humans in
the intestinal compartment of certain animals and the increasing
use of antimicrobials might have also contributed to the extra-
ordinary increase and spread of the blaklu/CTX-M genes (Lartigue
et al., 2006; Nordmann et al., 2008). Apart from these specula-
tions, an interesting question is if mobilization of blaklu occurred,
how often was it in the nature? Initially and accepting the genus
Kluyvera as progenitor of the CTX-M enzymes, we can suspect
mobilization of the same number of occasions has CTX-M clus-
ters has been described. Barlow et al. (2008) using phylogenetic
trees based on gene distance suggest that this occurred at least
eight times (three times each for CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-2 clus-
ters and only one each for CTX-M-9 and CTX-M-8; Barlow et al.,
2008). However the description of different IS such as ISEcp1 and
ISCR1 related to CTX-M-9 (Valverde et al., 2009), allow us to
suspect that more mobilization events may have occurred (see
below).

EVOLUTION AND DIVERSIFICATION OF CTX-M
β-LACTAMASES
Cumulative representation of the new variants described among
the most prevalent β-lactamases shows that the highest slope
during the last years correspond to the CTX-M and OXA-type β-
lactamases (Bush and Fisher, 2011). This might indicate that they
have recently suffered the most spectacular diversiﬁcation process
in the β-lactamases world. CTX-M phylogenetic trees suggest an
explosive diversiﬁcation from the original bla genes in a short time
when they arrived in the clinical scenario (Novais et al., 2010). The
ﬁrst CTX-Ms identiﬁed were able to confer cefotaxime resistance
although their capacities to efﬁciently hydrolyze ceftazidime was
very low or null, but nowadays more than 60% of CTX-M variants
are able to confer cefotaxime and ceftazidime-resistance simul-
taneously. Thus, ceftazidime could have been one of the main
selective forces contributing to the diversiﬁcation of CTX-Ms.

An evolution experiment was designed in our laboratory to
obtain more efﬁcient CTX-M variants against ceftazidime; the
ceftazidime-resistant CTX-M variants carried the changes A77V,
P167S, and D240G (Novais et al., 2008). These changes have been
described in the nature in several cases including CTX-M-52
and CTX-M-87, which derived from CTX-M-15 and CTX-M-
14 respectively (Yin et al., 2009). These results reinforce the idea
that ceftazidime has driven the selection of new CTX-M vari-
ants. Moreover, we calculated the ratio of the number of non-
synonymous substitutions with respect to synonymous substitu-

tions (= dN/dS) among the blaCTX-M gene variants in order to

deﬁne positive (accelerate evolution) or puriﬁed (slow evolution-
ary rate) selection processes during the diversiﬁcation of CTX-Ms.
In the deep branches of the CTX-Ms phylogenetic tree, processes of
puriﬁed selection occurred while positive selection was the mech-
anism of molecular evolution in the more recent branches. In
our experiments, six positions were identiﬁed to be under pos-
itive selection, including the amino acid positions 77, 167, and
240, which were affected under ceftazidime regimens. Neverthe-
less, our results also suggest the presence of more evolutionary
forces involved in the selection of new and better adapted vari-
ants. The construction of mutants carrying combinations of these
mutations revealed that the simultaneous presence of cefotaxime
and ceftazidime in the environment has modeled the explosive
evolution and diversiﬁcation of the CTX-M enzyme (Novais et al.,
2010).

Recombination events also accelerate the evolution. These
events have also been described among blaCTX-M genes. As an
example, the CTX-M-64 enzyme is the result of a recombination
between members of the blaCTX-M-9 and blaCTX-M-1 derived genes,
probably blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M-15, as they are the most preva-
lent variants in the world (Nagano et al., 2009). The recombination

CTX-M enzymes: origin and diffusion

requires the simultaneous presence of both blaCTX-Ms in a same
habitat. Recently, we described in an Ethiopian 1-year-old boy
both CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15 (Morosini et al., 2010). Moreover,
in a national surveillance performed in China, the CTX-M-64 β-
lactamase was recovered from three patients co-existing with other
CTX-Ms (Sun et al., 2010). As the concomitant presence of dif-
ferent CTX-M β-lactamases in the same bacteria is no longer an
unusual event, other recombinant enzymes might emerge in the
near future.

blaCTX-M GENE PLASTICITY AND OTHER STRATEGIES TO
INCREASE THE SPECTRUM OF ACTION OF CTX-M
β-LACTAMASES
β-Lactamases are highly modeling proteins as few positions are
critical to hydrolyze β-lactam compounds. Nowadays, at least
136 polymorphic positions have been found among all CTX-Ms
described. Some of these changes play a main role increasing the
β-lactam hydrolytic spectrum while others modulate or restore the
synergic or antagonist effects caused by other modiﬁcations. Fur-
thermore, some mutations are selected depending on the genetic
background due to the interactions among the mutations present
(epistasis) whereas other changes have an unknown effect on the
enzyme and they could be only selected by random drift. For
instance, directed mutagenesis studies have revealed new muta-
tions that have not yet been described in nature, which could be
selected under ceftazidime challenge such as M135I and A219V
(Pérez-Llarena et al., 2011). These results suggest that the adap-
tive possibilities of CTX-M enzymes have not yet reached their
evolutionary stasis.

In this section we explore if other mutations or adaptive pos-
sibilities could be expected in the CTX-M lineage. Two attractive
issues are raised in relation to the capacities of CTX-Ms to con-
fer resistance to non-oxyimino-β-lactam antibiotics, including β-
lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations (IR-CTX-M) and/or
carbapenems (Girlich et al., 2008; Ripoll et al., 2011), as these vari-
ants have not yet been found in nature. In laboratory conditions,
IR-CTX-M mutants carrying the S130G, K234R, and S237A muta-
tions have been described (Gazouli et al., 1998; Aumeran et al.,
2003; Ripoll et al., 2011). The selection of these mutants con-
ferring resistance to β-lactam plus β-lactamase inhibitors showed
an antagonistic pleiotropic effect with a simultaneous loss of the
hydrolytic activity against cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Neverthe-
less, the L169S mutation that was recovered after the S130G was
selected, slightly increase the hydrolytic efﬁciency against cefo-
taxime and ceftazidime, suggesting that mutations at position 169
could have a restoring effect, similar to the selection of A77V muta-
tion after the emergence of P167S or D240G driving ceftazidime-
resistance (Novais et al., 2008; Ripoll et al., 2011). Interestingly,
a clinical isolate carrying a novel CTX-M variant (CTX-M-93),
which differs from CTX-M-27 in a single L169Q mutation, shows
a reduced activity against cefotaxime but increased activity against
ceftazidime when compared with its progenitor (Djamdjian et al.,
2011). This ﬁnding conﬁrms that the mutations in 169-position
confers increased hydrolytic activity against ceftazidime and this
improvement is higher when the S130G mutation is also present.
On the other hand, a recent study using a site-directed muta-
genesis strategy found that the V103D and V260L mutations also

endow an IR-CTX-M phenotype (Pérez-Llarena et al., 2011), again
suggesting that new mutants could be selected in the future.

No mutations in blaCTX-M gene have been involved in resis-
tance to carbapenems. However, clinical carbapenem-resistant
strains carrying CTX-M β-lactamases have been isolated. Two
types of mutants are related to this carbapenem-resistant phe-
notype: loss of porins and co-existence with other β-lactamases
(Gülmez et al., 2008). The loss of OmpK35 and OmpK36 porins is
the most frequent mechanism of carbapenem-resistant associated
with CTX-M producing K. pneumoniae (Leavitt et al., 2009) and its
functional restoration signiﬁcantly decreased the MICs of all car-
bapenems (Doumith et al., 2009). In vivo resistance development
to carbapenem has been previously described in two K. pneu-
moniae strains producing CTX-M-1 due to the lack of OmpK36
expression (Mena et al., 2006). However, the loss of this porin
reduced in vitro ﬁtness and attenuated virulence in a murine model
(García-Sureda et al., 2011). Moreover, detection of carbapenem-
resistant E. coli clinical strains carrying CTX-M due to reduced
expression of OmpF and OmpC porins, homologous of OmpK35
and OmpF36, are increasingly recognized (Girlich et al., 2009; Ben-
nett et al., 2010). These results illustrated that porin deﬁciency is
more efﬁcient than potential CTX-M mutation for the increase of
carbapenem MICs.

On the other hand, the high worldwide distribution of CTX-
M enzymes is giving rise to the co-existence of two or more
β-lactamases in the same strain. This possibility is becoming a
common bacterial strategy to enhance antibiotic resistance. CTX-
Ms have been described associated with VIM-1 (Miró et al., 2010),
KPC-2 (Chen et al., 2011), or OXA-48 carbapenemases (Cuzon
et al., 2011; Pitart et al., 2011). In fact, the clone belonging to ST395
coproducing CTX-M-15 and OXA-48 has been demonstrated
widespread throughout Europe (Potron et al., 2011). An extreme
description was the co-existence of KPC-2, VIM-19, CMY-2,
and CTX-M-15 in a K. pneumoniae strain isolated in Greece
(Pournaras et al., 2010). Moreover, the recently described NDM-
1 carbapenemase is normally present in isolates also expressing
the CTX-M-15 ESBL and also OXA-type enzymes (Poirel et al.,
2011a; Solé et al., 2011). This supports the concept of the genetic
capitalism of the multi-drug resistant bacteria where the more
resistant bacteria have the higher opportunity to become more
resistant (Baquero et al., 2003; Cantón et al., 2003; Baquero,
2004).

GENETIC ENVIRONMENTS OF blaCTX-M GENES
PARTICIPATING IN THE MOBILIZATION, SPREAD, AND
MAINTENANCE OF THESE GENES
A linkage of different blaCTX-M genes with speciﬁc surrounding
genetic elements, including IS, integrons, and transposons has
been described. These genetic backbones are integrated in more
complex structures such as different plasmid replicon types as well
as speciﬁc clones deﬁning a complex hierarchical organization
with the possibility of interchanging different modules (Cantón
and Coque, 2006; Carattoli, 2011; Woodford et al., 2011). Figure 2
shows hierarchical complexity of blaCTX-M genes within different
genetic structures and bacterial clones participating in the mobi-
lization, spread, and maintenance of these genes. As previously
described, blaCTX-M genes have been hypothetically mobilized

www.frontiersin.org

Cantón et al.

CTX-M enzymes: origin and diffusion

from Kluyvera spp. by IS and to a lesser extent by bacteriophages.
The IS also participate in the over-expression of these genes and
some of them (i.e., ISCR1) are adjacent to integron structures that
are also integrated in transposition units. These supra-structures
are often incorporated within conjugative plasmids that might be
present in successful clones (or the so-called high-risk clones).
Moreover, they can operate as evolutionary units and might indi-
vidually act as units of selection (Baquero, 2004; Cantón and
Ruiz-Garbajosa, 2011).

Some of the genetic elements and plasmids harboring blaCTX-M
genes also harbor other resistance genes, including those encod-
ing AmpC β-lactamases (plasmid blaAmpC) and carbapenemases,
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes (i.e., qnr
genes), or methylases affecting aminoglycosides. All these genes
might also give advantage to blaCTX-M for maintenance due to
co-selection processes.

INSERTION SEQUENCES AND PHAGE-RELATED SEQUENCES INVOLVED
IN THE MOBILIZATION OF blaCTX-M GENES
There are a huge number of scientiﬁc articles describing new or
unique genetic rearrangement associated with blaCTX-M genes but
further analysis has revealed that they are only variations of a few
different genetic structures (Lartigue et al., 2004; Eckert et al., 2006;
Dhanji et al., 2011b; Toleman and Walsh, 2011). The experimental
mobilization of blaCTX-Ms genes have been demonstrated by IS
located upstream such as ISEcp1 (Lartigue et al., 2006). Moreover,
the effect of Pout promoter of these IS increasing the blaCTX-Ms

expression suggests that the IS located upstream of these genes
have a role in the selection and dissemination of CTX-Ms. There-
fore, we have mainly considered in this part of the review the
genetic upstream sequences of the blaCTX-M genes. The informa-
tion of downstream sequences of blaCTX-M genes is less available
and less knowledge has been accumulated.

Different IS have been identiﬁed upstream of the blaCTX-Ms
genes, including ISEcp1, ISCR1, IS10, and IS26. Although other IS
elements have also been described upstream, they were the result of
subsequent integration events. For instance, IS1 and IS10, and even
ISCR1 and IS26, have been described interrupting ISEcp1 (Eckert
et al., 2006; Bae et al., 2008). ISEcp1 is the most widely found
IS upstream of different blaCTX-M. Although it was ﬁrst recorded
adjacent to the blaCTX-M-15 in 1999, it has been found associated
with all clusters of these β-lactamases except CTX-M-8. More-
over, ISCR1 has been related to several members of blaCTX-M-2
and blaCTX-M-9 clusters and IS10 with blaCTX-M-8. The number of
new genetic environments upstream of blaCTX-M must be related
to the number of mobilization events but unfortunately in many
blaCTX-M cases the upstream sequence is unknown (Barlow et al.,
2008). Nowadays, we have been able to identify at least nine mobi-
lization events (Figure 4): three in CTX-M-1 cluster (blaCTX-M-10,
blaCTX-M-53, and other known blaCTX-M genes included in this
cluster), two in CTX-M-2 cluster (blaCTX-M-2 and blaCTX-M-5),
two in CTX-M-9 cluster (blaCTX-M-9 and blaCTX-M-14), and one
each in CTX-M-8 and CTX-M-25 (blaCTX-M-8 and blaCTX-M-25,
respectively).

CTX-M enzymes: origin and diffusion

On the other hand, spacer sequences between ISEcp1 and
blaCTX-M genes have been well studied. The genetic distance
between IS and blaCTX-M gene is related to cephalosporin MIC
values (Ma et al., 2011). These distances ranged between 48
and 127 bp in blaCTX-M-1 gene cluster, between 34 and 42 bp
in blaCTX-M-9 gene cluster (but more than 300 bp if ISCR1 is
upstream of blaCTX-M) and around 40–52 in blaCTX-M-25 and
blaCTX-M-8 gene clusters respectively. When the homology among
spacer sequences of blaCTX-M-1 gene cluster was analyzed, all
but blaCTX-M-10 and blaCTX-M-53 maintained a common region
(known as V and W sequences). This suggests that these blaCTX-M
genes belonging to CTX-M-1 cluster could derive from a single
transposition event. A similar conclusion can be obtained when
considering ISEcp1 and blaCTX-M genes belonging to blaCTX-M-9
(Y sequence), blaCTX-M-8 and blaCTX-M-25 (Figure 5). In all these
clusters, the ancestral source was K. georgiana. However the lack of
homology among spacer sequences of these blaCTX-M gene clus-
ters suggests a different source in each case. These results reveal
that non-described Kluyvera species (or another organism source)
could be the origin of clusters ascribed to K. georgiana (see Figure 3

about the phylogenetic tree of 16S rDNA of Kluyvera spp. where
more species of Kluyvera can be suggested according to bootstrap
values).

Finally, blaCTX-M-10 gene has been associated with phage-
related sequences, which underlines bacteriophages involvement
in the potential mobilization of this gene (Oliver et al., 2001).
Although the occurrence of this event has not been frequently
demonstrated, the importance of bacteriophages in the diffusion
of bla genes was evaluated in sewage, showing that these sequences
may contribute to the spread of some β-lactamases (Muniesa
et al., 2004; Colomer-Lluch et al., 2011). Part of these sequences,
also known as “phage-like elements,” could have facilitated mobi-
lization of resistance genes into the chromosome (Wozniak and
Waldor, 2010; Guglielmini et al., 2011). With the exception of
the previous description of the CTX-M-10 enzyme (Oliver et al.,
2001), these structures have not been associated with other CTX-
Ms despite the fact that these enzymes have also been observed
integrated into the chromosome (Coelho et al., 2010; Song et al.,
2011). Future in silico analysis might reveal a more frequent
presence of these phage-like elements associated with bla genes.

clusters. Different blaCTX-M genes belonging to the same cluster share an
identical DNA sequence in upstream region, suggesting the same origin
(A). Nevertheless, the loss of alignment among different upstream

sequences from different blaCTX-M genes belonging to different clusters
(included in the box squared) but theoretically derived from the same
ancestral source in Kluyvera georgiana suggesting that these clusters had
different sources (B).

OTHER INTEGRATIVE AND MOBILIZATION UNITS
Recently, there has been an increasing interest for the so-called
“integrative and conjugative elements” (ICEs) in the mobilization
of resistant determinants. They are not homogenous structures
and include the “conjugative transposons” or the so-called “inte-
grated conjugative plasmids.” These elements are a diverse group
of mobile genetic elements found in both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria. They primarily reside in the chromo-
some, but retain the ability to excise from and re-integrate into
a new chromosome like bacteriophages and to transfer between
bacterial cells by conjugation like plasmids. It has been recently
stressed that they are closely linked to some of the more powerful
resistance mechanisms such as the extended-spectrum-, metallo-,
and AmpC type β-lactamases (Toleman and Walsh, 2011).

A characteristic of the ICE elements, as well as complex class
1 integrons and some IS is the inability to consistently recognize
one of their own terminal sequences, while they recognize more
genetically distant surrogate sequences. This has the effect of mobi-
lizing the DNA sequence found adjacent to their initial location.
This process is known as one-ended transposition mechanisms
and is exempliﬁed by some IS such as ISCR1 and ISEcp1 as well
as Tn3 and Tn21 derivatives, including Tn5090-like transposon
(also called Tn402) that in turn harbor the class 1 integrons, ISCR1
and certain blaCTX-M genes. A detailed review of the importance
of these elements in the emergence and dispersion of resistance
traits, including that exerted by blaCTX-M genes has been recently
reviewed (Toleman and Walsh, 2011).

A novel structure named IMU that resides in a plasmid 7-kb
IncQ-type plasmid has recently been associated with mobilization
of bla genes (Poirel et al., 2009). The IMU structure resembles that
of miniature inverted transposable elements (MITEs), which have
been identiﬁed in eukaryotes such as plants (Chen et al., 2008) and
also in bacteria (Buisine et al., 2002; Filée et al., 2007). In Enter-
obacteriaceae, they form a composite like element consisting of
288-bp elements located in opposite orientation able to mobilize
defective class 1 integron structures carrying bla genes. Although
they have not yet been associated with mobilization of blaCTX-M
genes, they might participate in the future in the mobilization of
these genes.

PLASMIDS AND SPREAD OF blaCTX-M GENES
The importance of plasmids in the spread of blaCTX-M genes
is exempliﬁed with certain CTX-M β-lactamases and has been
stressed in several publications (Carattoli, 2009). The case of CTX-
M-15 enzyme is of particular interest. It has been shown that the
blaCTX-M-15 gene is mainly associated with incompatibility group
FII plasmids (Coque et al., 2008b). They are a paradigm of nar-
row host-rage plasmids characterized by a low-copy number in the
bacteria. They are mainly found in Enterobacteriaceae and have
recently been termed as“epidemic resistance plasmids”due to their
propensity to acquire resistance genes and transfer among bacte-
ria (Carattoli, 2011). The FII plasmids are not a homogeneous
group and might have evolved by recombinatorial events among
different plasmids. It has been shown that within these plasmids
different replicon types are present that might facilitate fast evo-
lution and plasmid diversiﬁcation. Interestingly, initial studies on
IncFII plasmids suggest that they were widely distributed within

Enterobacteriaceae before antimicrobial use provided that they
were well adapted to these organisms (Datta et al., 1980). This
fact has undoubtedly facilitated persistence and spread of resis-
tant determinants, including blaCTX-M genes after this acquisition.
Moreover, incorporation of genetic determinants mediating non
β-lactam resistance mechanisms would have also contributed to
the maintenance of these plasmids within the bacteria and hence
the blaCTX-M genes under co-selection process (Novais et al., 2007;
Woodford et al., 2009).

On the other hand, broad host-range replicon plasmids such as
IncN, IncI1, and IncL/M have also been involved in the dissemi-
nation and spread of CTX-M enzymes. Some of these plasmids,
such as IncN, might have their reservoir in animals as they have
been isolated in Salmonella spp. and E. coli from food producing
animals (Carattoli, 2011). They often carry qnr and aac(6
)-Ib-
cr genes determining low level ﬂuoroquinolone resistance (Shen
et al., 2008; Bado et al., 2010). More recently, these plasmids have
been able to acquire genes coding the emerging carbapenemase
such as blaNDM-1 (Poirel et al., 2011b) and have been identi-
ﬁed as epidemic plasmids in countries with a high prevalence of
carbapenem resistance (Psichogiou et al., 2008). Other plasmids,
such as IncL/M group are also able to carry blaCTX-M genes (i.e.,
blaCTX-M-3 and blaCTX-M-15) as well as those producing methylase
encoding genes involved in aminoglycoside resistance (i.e., armA;
Sabtcheva et al., 2008; Naas et al., 2011).

(cid:2)

Other plasmid types that have been preferentially associated
with blaCTX-M genes are IncK plasmids with blaCTX-M-14 in south-
ern Europe (Valverde et al., 2009; Cottell et al., 2011) and IncHI2
plasmids with blaCTX-M-2 and blaCTX-M-9 in other geographic areas
(García-Fernández et al., 2007). Nevertheless, these plasmids have
also been responsible for the dispersion of other resistance genes
such as IncK and blaCMY genes (Baudry et al., 2009) or IncHI2
and blaVIM and qnr genes (García-Fernández and Carattoli, 2010;
Oteo et al., 2010b). These results denote ability of these plasmids
for recruitment resistance genes, hence facilitating the increasing
prevalence and persistence of the resistance traits of the bacte-
ria. Furthermore, it is expected that persistence over time also
gives opportunity to the bacteria to generate gene variation and
an increasing the number of blaCTX-M variants in the coming years
as has occurred with OXA-type β-lactamases. Some of these vari-
ants have been obtained in vitro under antibiotic selective pressure
but have not yet been found in clinical isolates (Novais et al., 2008,
2010; Ripoll et al., 2011).

CLONAL DISPERSION AND CO-SELECTION PROCESSES:
INVOLVEMENT OF MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT AND VIRULENT
HIGH-RISK CLONES
One of the most interesting issues in the dispersion of CTX-M
enzymes is the participation of speciﬁc clones, particularly those
from E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Recent approaches based on
MLST typing have demonstrated that despite a high diversity
among CTX-M producers, a few clones or sequence types (ST)
grouped in clonal complexes (CC) have been repeatedly found
linked to CTX-M enzymes. This suggests that they are involved
in the dissemination of these enzymes and that the adaptive suc-
cess of some CTX-M enzymes could also depend on speciﬁc ST
or CC where they are frequently present. These clones have been

Cantón et al.

CTX-M enzymes: origin and diffusion

named as high-risk clones (Woodford et al., 2011). The case of
worldwide CTX-M-15 producing E. coli isolates exempliﬁes this
issue as most of these isolates belong to the internationally spread
ST131 clone (Coque et al., 2008b; Woodford et al., 2011). ST131
is the predicted founder of a clonal cluster that comprises 13 sin-
gle locus variants (SLVs) and three double-locus variants (DLVs).
It is related to serotype O25:H4 as well as to phylogenetic group
B2, which grouped virulent extraintestinal isolates (Coque et al.,
2008b; Peirano and Pitout, 2010). In addition, isolates belonging
to this clone or CC frequently carry IncFII plasmids suggesting a
common co-evolutionary process.

Different population structure studies of E. coli demonstrated
that ST131 clone is also not only associated with CTX-M enzymes
belonging to group 1 (CTX-M-1, CTX-M-3, and CTX-M-10) but
also with others from distinct groups, such as CTX-M-9 or CTX-
M-14 (Mora et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2011). This spread is present
among human and animal isolates. In addition, very recent stud-
ies also showed that ST131 is over represented within non-ESBL
producing isolates (Blanco et al., 2011) and that this clone can
recruit emerging β-lactamases such as NDM-1 (Peirano et al.,
2011). Multiresistance might have facilitated globalization of this
clone. Moreover, at individual level the presence of speciﬁc vir-
ulence traits facilitating host adherence and receptor epithelial
binding also contribute to persistence (Peirano and Pitout, 2010).
Other lineages of E. coli that have also contributed to the spread
of CTX-M enzymes are ST38, ST393, and ST405 clones and their
corresponding single- and DLVs (Coque et al., 2008a; Blanco
et al., 2011). These lineages belong to serotype D, which repre-
sents also virulent extraintestinal strains (Picard et al., 1999). ST38
and ST393 seem to have been more preferential for the CTX-M-9
and CTX-M-14 enzymes whereas ST405 have been more pref-
erentially with CTX-15 enzyme. Again these clones might also
be overrepresented within non-ESBL producing isolates increas-
ing the opportunity to recruit the corresponding blaCTX-M genes.
These clones also express other emerging β-lactamases such as
OXA-48 and NDM-1 as illustrated with ST38 (Poirel et al., 2011a;
Yamamoto et al., 2011).

coli

Many isolates belonging to these E.

clones are
ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant uropathogenic isolates that have their
natural environment
in the intestinal microbiota. Fluoro-
quinolones might favor co-selection phenomena that could enrich
the intestinal microbiota with these isolates. It has even been
speculated that ﬂuoroquinolone resistance either due to plasmid-
(cid:2)
mediated genes, including qnr variants and acc(6
)-Ib-cr, or to
topoisomerase mutations preceded the acquisition of blaCTX-M
genes (Jones et al., 2008; Naseer and Sundsfjord, 2011). In addition
to this resistant trait, high-risk clones expressing CTX-M enzymes
are also more favorable for acquiring other resistance mecha-
nisms, such as those affecting aminoglycosides, trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole and fosfomycin. Aminoglycoside resistance is
related both with aminoglycoside modifying enzymes and methy-
lases (Mushtaq et al., 2011). Fosfomycin resistance involving dif-
ferent resistance mechanisms has been more recently describe in
isolates from the community in countries with increasing use of
this antibiotic (Oteo et al., 2009). This again illustrates the genetic
capitalism of the resistant bacterias (Baquero et al., 2003; Cantón
et al., 2003; Baquero, 2004).

Together with these points, these CTX-M associated E. coli
clones are highly virulent, easily transmitted among family mem-
bers in colonized or infected patients (Mihaila et al., 2010) and
have been found in wild-life, companion and food animals (Mora
et al., 2010; Platell et al., 2011).

In K. pneumoniae more attention has been paid to carbapen-
emases, mainly KPCs, and the involvement of ST258 clone in
their dissemination (Woodford et al., 2011). Nevertheless, differ-
ent publications have studied the implication of different clones
in the dissemination of CTX-M enzymes associated with K. pneu-
moniae. This is for instance the case of CC11, which has been
identiﬁed widely spread in Asia associated with different CTX-M
enzymes, including CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15 (Ko et al., 2010;
Lee et al., 2011). In Hungary this CC and also ST15 and ST147
were found to be responsible for the country-wide dissemination
of ciproﬂoxacin-resistant CTX-M-15 producing K. pneumoniae
(Damjanova et al., 2008). Also in the Copenhagen area of Den-
mark a K. pneumoniae ST16 clone harboring the blaCTX-M-15 and
blaSHV-28 genes was recognized as producing hospital outbreaks.
(Nielsen et al., 2011). Some of these clones were able to acquire
carbapenemases and other resistant traits due to their particu-
lar preferential for speciﬁc plasmids, including IncFII, IncN and
IncL/M (Andrade et al., 2011). This observation exempliﬁes once
more the genetic capitalism concept for which resistant organisms
tend to be more resistant (Baquero et al., 2003; Cantón et al., 2003;
Baquero, 2004).

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Although in recent years more interest has given to carbapen-
emases than ESBLs, the CTX-M family still deserve the close
attention of researchers and constitute a paradigm of the emer-
gence and spread of a resistant mechanism. Previous descriptions
of hierarchical structures that include the blaCTX-M genes delin-
eated the importance of these structures for maintenance and
spread of these genes. Comparison of blaCTX-M sequences with
sequence databases hypothetically deﬁned that blaCTX-M genes
have their ancestors in different Kluyvera spp. Nevertheless, in sil-
ico analyses also suggest that blaCTX-M genes might also have
circulated among different Kluyvera species and that the incor-
poration to these organisms might well have occurred after these
species diverged. In Enterobacteriaceae, the great adaptive suc-
cess of blaCTX-M genes has been associated with few surrounding
genetic structures, few plasmids and few bacterial clones. Suc-
cessful associations of these units and co-existence of blaCTX-M
genes with other resistance determinants might have contributed
to the extraordinary spread of the CTX-M enzymes deserving an
uncontrolled pandemic scenario. Future persistence of blaCTX-M
genes within bacterial communities will be assured by co-selection
processes as other resistance genes, including emerging ones such
as carbapenemases, are now often present in CTX-M produc-
ing organisms. Persistence will also give new opportunities for
evolution.
