Measles virus (MV) is an enveloped negative strand RNA virus belonging to the family of
Paramyxoviridae, genus Morbillivirus, and causes one of the most contagious diseases
in humans. Experimentally infected non-human primates are used as animal models for
studies of the pathogenesis of human measles. We established a reverse genetics sys-
tem based on a highly pathogenic wild-type MV. Infection of monkeys with recombinant
MV strains generated by reverse genetics enabled analysis of the molecular basis of MV
pathogenesis.The essential in vivo function of accessory genes was indicated by infecting
monkeys with recombinant MV strains deﬁcient in the expression of accessory genes.
Furthermore, recombinant wild-type MV strains expressing enhanced green ﬂuorescent
protein enabled visual tracking of MV-infected cells in vitro and in vivo. To date, three differ-
ent molecules have been identiﬁed as receptors for MV. Signaling lymphocyte activation
molecule (SLAM, also called CD150), expressed on immune cells, is a major receptor
for MV. CD46, ubiquitously expressed in all nucleated cells in humans and monkeys, is a
receptor for vaccine and laboratory-adapted strains of MV. The newly identiﬁed nectin-4
(also called poliovirus-receptor-like-4) is an epithelial cell receptor for MV. However, recent
ﬁndings have indicated that CD46 acts as an MV receptor in vitro but not in vivo.The impact
of the receptor usage of MV in vivo on the disease outcome is now under investigation.

INTRODUCTION
Measles is a febrile disease that typically occurs in small children;
the incubation period is 10–14 days, after which clinical symp-
toms such as fever, coughing, and a characteristic rash appears.
Since measles is accompanied by immunosuppression, it has a
high frequency of complication with secondary bacterial infec-
tions, such as otitis media or pneumonia. Although developed
countries are eradicating measles by promoting effective vaccina-
tion, measles remains an important issue, especially in developing
countries (Grifﬁn, 2007).

Measles virus (MV), belonging to the genus Morbillivirus of
the family Paramyxoviridae, is an enveloped virus with a non-
segmented negative strand RNA genome. The MV genome has six
genes that encode the nucleocapsid (N), phospho (P), matrix (M),
fusion (F), hemagglutinin (H), and large (L) proteins (Figure 1A).
MV contains two envelope glycoproteins: the H protein, which is
responsible for receptor binding and is important for determining
cell tropism of MV; and the F protein, which mediates membrane
fusion (Navaratnarajah et al., 2009). The P gene encodes the P
protein and the non-structural V and C proteins. The V and C
proteins are important for antagonizing the host interferon (IFN)
response (Gerlier and Valentin, 2009).

To date, three different molecules have been identiﬁed as recep-
tors for MV. Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM,
also called CD150), expressed in certain immune system cells
including activated B and T lymphocytes, mature dendritic cells,
and macrophages, is a receptor for wild-type MV and vaccine
and laboratory-adapted strains of MV (Tatsuo et al., 2000).

CD46 (also called membrane cofactor protein), expressed in all
human and monkey nucleated cells, is a receptor for vaccine and
laboratory-adapted strains of MV (Dorig et al., 1993; Naniche
et al., 1993). Recently, nectin-4 [also called poliovirus-receptor-
like-4 (PVRL4)] has been identiﬁed as the epithelial receptor for
wild-type MV (Muhlebach et al., 2011; Noyce et al., 2011).

Several animal models have been used for studying the patho-
genesis of MV (Grifﬁn, 2007). Cotton rats, rats, hamsters, mice,
and ferrets can be infected with MV and are commonly used
as small animal models for MV pathogenesis. After identiﬁca-
tion of CD46 and SLAM as MV receptors, numerous transgenic
and knock-in mice expressing human CD46 and/or SLAM were
established and intensively used to study different aspects of MV
infection (Sellin and Horvat, 2009). However, non-human pri-
mates are the only animals that exhibit acute disease similar to
that seen in humans. In this review, we discuss recent ﬁndings
regarding tropism and pathogenesis of MV; these ﬁndings were
obtained by infecting monkeys with recombinant wild-type MV.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF MONKEY MODELS
When infected with measles, monkeys exhibit similar symptoms
as seen in humans. This was reported as early as 1911, after inocu-
lating monkeys with blood from measles patients (Anderson and
Goldberger, 1911). In 1921, it was reported that measles could be
transmitted from humans to monkeys by placing a ﬁltered throat
swab from a measles patient into the tracheae of monkeys (Blake
and Trask, 1921a). These authors also performed histological
analysis of infected monkeys (Blake and Trask, 1921b). However,

SLAM is highly expressed on B95a cells (Tatsuo et al., 2000), which
accounts for the efﬁcient isolation of pathogenic MV from patient
samples. Similar to MV strains isolated from B95a cells, MV strains
isolated and propagated in monkey mononuclear cells, human
cord blood cells, human B lymphoblastoid cell lines, and Vero cells
expressing SLAM replicated well in monkeys and induced clinical
signs of measles (van Binnendijk et al., 1994; McChesney et al.,
1997; Zhu et al., 1997; Auwaerter et al., 1999; El Mubarak et al.,
2007; Bankamp et al., 2008). These results suggest that expression
of SLAM on cells used for isolation is important for isolation of
pathogenic MV.

REVERSE GENETICS OF MV
Reverse genetics refers to the methods used for recovering infec-
tious viruses from the cDNA that encodes the viral genome. By
using this method, mutations or extra transcription units can
be introduced into viral genomes by the modiﬁcation of cDNA
plasmids. Reverse genetics of MV was ﬁrst established based on
the Edmonston vaccine strain (Radecke et al., 1995). However,
as previously mentioned, viruses derived from the Edmonston
vaccine strain do not induce clinical symptoms of measles in
monkeys. Therefore, reverse genetics of pathogenic wild-type
MV was needed for the study of MV pathogenesis in mon-
keys. To this end, we ﬁrst determined the complete nucleotide
sequence of the genome of the pathogenic wild-type IC-B strain
(NC_001498/AB016162; Takeuchi et al., 2000), which was iso-
lated in Tokyo in 1984 by using B95a cells (Kobune et al., 1990).
Then, we constructed a complete cDNA plasmid of the IC-B
strain named p(+)MV323, and successfully recovered infectious
MV (IC323 strain) from the p(+)MV323 plasmid (Takeda et al.,
2000). Importantly, the IC323 strain induced clinical signs such as
rash, Koplik’s spots, and lymphopenia similar to human measles in
infected monkeys, indicating that the IC323 strain retains the orig-
inal pathogenicity of the IC-B strain. Now, infectious MV strains
can be easily recovered from cDNA plasmids by using an improved
protocol (Takeda et al., 2005).

Reverse genetics of other wild-type MV strains has been
reported for the HL strain isolated in Japan (Terao-Muro et al.,
2008) and the KS strain isolated in Sudan (Lemon et al., 2011). For
vaccine strains of MV, reverse genetics for the Schwarz/Moraten
vaccine strain (Combredet et al., 2003; del Valle et al., 2007) and
the AIK-C vaccine strain (Nakayama et al., 2001) have also been
reported. Reverse genetics for vaccine strains are being used as a
platform to generate new multivalent vaccines expressing antigens
of other pathogens (Billeter et al., 2009) and oncolytic viruses for
cancer therapy (Russell and Peng, 2009).

FUNCTION OF MV ACCESSORY PROTEINS IN VIVO
The P gene of MV encodes two non-structural proteins, namely
the C and V proteins. However, the function of the C and V pro-
teins in vivo was not well understood. The C protein is a small (186
amino acid), highly positively charged protein. To study the func-
tion of the C protein in the context of the natural course of MV
pathogenesis, we generated an IC323 strain deﬁcient in the expres-
sion of the C protein, wtMV(C−), by using the reverse genetics
of wild-type MV (Takeuchi et al., 2005). Notably, the growth of
wtMV(C−) in cynomolgus monkeys was dramatically reduced

FIGURE 1 | (A) Schematic diagram of measles virus genome. The P gene
encodes the P protein and the non-structural V and C proteins. The V protein
is translated from an edited RNA with a non-templated G residue. The V
protein-speciﬁc region is indicated in red. The C protein is translated from
an alternative open reading frame (purple) initiated by the second AUG. (B)
Isolation of wild-type MV using B95a cells. Pathogenic wild-type MV strains
can be isolated by inoculating throat swabs from measles patients in B95a
cells. MV strains isolated in Vero cells lose their pathogenicity.

at this time, “MV” had not yet been discovered. MV was ﬁrst iso-
lated in 1954 from a specimen obtained from a measles patient
(Enders and Peebles, 1954). Enders and Peebles (1954) inoculated
human and monkey cell cultures with a throat swab taken from
a young boy named David Edmonston and isolated MV from
these cultures. After this, it was discovered that MV isolated from
normal human renal cells caused clinical signs similar to those
of human measles in monkeys (Peebles et al., 1957). Since then,
numerous studies have been carried out by infecting monkeys with
MV, measles vaccines, or specimens from measles patients (Grifﬁn,
2007). In such experiments, two species of monkeys, cynomol-
gus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) and rhesus monkey (Macaca
mulatta), serve as good animal models. New World monkeys are
more susceptible to MV than Old World monkeys, and infection
of marmoset (Saguinus mystax) with MV results in a fulminant
disease (Levy and Mirkovic, 1971; Albrecht et al., 1980).

In the past, it was well known that infection of monkeys with
materials from measles patients induced clinical signs similar to
those of human measles (Nii et al., 1964; Yamanouchi et al., 1970;
Sakaguchi et al., 1986). However, curiously enough, infection of
monkeys with MV isolated and propagated in cultured cells did not
always induce these clinical signs (Enders et al., 1960; Yamanouchi
et al., 1970; van Binnendijk et al., 1994). This riddle was solved
by the introduction of B95a cells (a marmoset B-lymphoid cell
line) for isolation and propagation of MV (Kobune et al., 1990).
Kobune et al. (1990, 1996) found that MV strains could be efﬁ-
ciently isolated in B95a cells using materials from measles patients.
More importantly, MV strains isolated from B95a cells retained
their original pathogenicity in monkeys. These studies indicated
that vaccine and laboratory-adapted strains of MV previously iso-
lated from non-lymphoid cells such as Vero cells were not true
MV (Figure 1B). A decade later, it was found that the MV receptor

when compared to the IC323 strain. A similar growth defect of
the IC323 strain deﬁcient in the expression of the C protein, Cko,
in vivo was observed in rhesus monkeys (Devaux et al., 2008).
Interestingly, Cko induced more inﬂammatory cytokines such as
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 and
interferon (IFN)-α and -β in infected monkeys.

The V protein is translated from an edited mRNA of the P gene
(Grifﬁn, 2007). Thus, the amino-terminal domain of the V pro-
tein has the same amino acid sequence as the P protein, and the
carboxyl-terminal domain of the V protein has a highly conserved
amino acid sequence forming a zinc-binding domain, which is
important for function as an interferon antagonist (Gerlier and
Valentin, 2009). An IC323 strain deﬁcient in the expression of the
V protein, Vko, was generated by introducing nucleotide muta-
tions in the RNA-editing signal in the P gene (Devaux et al., 2008).
The growth of Vko in infected rhesus monkeys was lower than
that of the parental IC323 strain. Vko induced more inﬂammatory
cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and IFN-α and -β. An IC323 strain
unable to antagonize STAT1 function, STAT1-blind virus, was gen-
erated by introducing three amino acid substitutions in the shared
domain of the P and V proteins (Devaux et al., 2011). The STAT1-
blind virus induced short-lived viremia and no clinical signs in
infected rhesus monkeys. This virus induced more inﬂammatory
cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and a Th1/Th2 balance cytokine (IL-
12) in infected monkeys. Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate
that the C and V proteins are not non-essential gene products as
previously thought, but are stringently required for antagonizing
host innate immune and inﬂammatory responses in vivo.

In contrast, in vitro studies indicated that the V protein blocks
IFN-α/β signal transductions in infected cells, inhibits TLR7-
mediated IFN-α production in human plasmacytoid dendritic
cells, and inhibits IFN induction in infected cells by interacting

with MDA5 (Gerlier and Valentin, 2009). Furthermore, the C pro-
tein appears to inhibit IFN induction in infected cells by regulating
viral RNA synthesis (Nakatsu et al., 2008). Thus, it is necessary to
elucidate whether the in vivo phenotypes of C- and V-deﬁcient
viruses are similar to the in vitro phenotypes.

MV TROPISM IN VIVO
Recent advances in the study of virus tropism have included
the introduction of enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP)-
expressing viruses. In vivo tropism of Morbillivirus can be visual-
ized with high sensitivity in living animals as well as tissue samples
by using EGFP-expressing recombinant canine distemper viruses
(von Messling et al., 2004). Similarly, MV target tissues or organs
can be visualized with high sensitivity by infecting cynomolgus
monkeys with an EGFP-expressing IC323 strain (Figure 2). de
Swart et al. (2007) infected rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys with
an IC323 strain expressing EGFP (Hashimoto et al., 2002) and
examined the tropism of wild-type MV in vivo. They indicated
that the major target cells of wild-type MV were B and T lym-
phocytes and CD11c-positive, major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class-II-positive dendritic cells. This result is consistent
with the fact that SLAM is a receptor for wild-type MV. Infection
of ciliated epithelial cells in the trachea and lungs was also detected,
suggesting the presence of another receptor for MV in epithelial
cells.

Regarding the early target cells of wild-type MV, classical text-
books describe that the primary targets of MV are the epithelial
cells of the respiratory tract. However, SLAM is not expressed in
these epithelial cells. To examine the early target cells of wild-type
and vaccine strains of MV in the lung, de Vries et al. (2010) infected
cynomolgus monkeys with EGFP-expressing IC323 or vaccine
strains of MV via the intratracheal or aerosol route. They found

full-genome cDNA of the IC-B strain and the EGFP gene under the control of
the T7 promoter is introduced into CHO cells expressing human SLAM
(CHO/hSLAM), along with three supporting plasmids expressing N, P, and L

proteins, respectively, under the control of the T7 promoter. After infection
with vaccinia virus expressing the T7 RNA polymerase, wild-type MV
expressing EGFP can be recovered by mixing with B95a cells. EGFP
ﬂuorescence in tissues and organs of infected monkeys can be detected
using a ﬂuorescence microscope.

that CD11c-positive cells, which include alveolar macrophages and
dendritic cells, were the major targets of both viruses. Interest-
ingly, although viral replication and cellular tropism in the lungs
were similar for the two viruses, only wild-type MV caused sig-
niﬁcant viremia, suggesting a growth defect of the vaccine strain
in lymphocyte cells. Similarly, to examine the early target cells of
wild-type MV, Lemon et al. (2011) infected cynomolgus monkeys
with an EGFP-expressing wild-type MV based on the KS strain by
aerosol infection and found that the early target cells of wild-type
MV in monkeys are macrophages and dendritic cells. These stud-
ies indicated that alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells but not
the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract are the early target cells
of wild-type MV.

Nectin-4 is a newly identiﬁed epithelial cell receptor (EpR) for
MV. To examine the effect of nectin-4-using activity of MV on
disease outcomes in monkeys, an IC323 strain recognizing SLAM
but not nectin-4 was generated by introducing amino acid muta-
tions in the H protein (Leonard et al., 2008). At that time, nectin-4
had not been identiﬁed as a MV receptor, and this strain was
called EpR-blind virus. When rhesus monkeys were infected with
EpR-blind virus via the conjunctiva and nares, this virus induced
viremia and clinical signs in infected monkeys but did not propa-
gate in the lungs. This result indicates the importance of nectin-4
for the propagation of MV in the lungs, which is required for
the subsequent exit of MV from the host. Inversely, to examine
the impact of the recognition of SLAM by MV, an IC323 strain
recognizing nectin-4 but not SLAM, SLAM-blind, was generated
(Leonard et al., 2010). When rhesus monkeys were infected with
the SLAM-blind virus, it elicited no clinical symptoms. This result
indicates that SLAM recognition is necessary for MV virulence
and pathogenesis.

Vaccine and laboratory-adapted strains of MV can utilize both
CD46 and SLAM as cellular receptors. However, surprisingly, the
impact of the CD46-using activity of vaccine and laboratory-
adapted strains of MV on their tissue and organ tropism and
attenuation is not well understood. As CD46 is ubiquitously
expressed on all nucleated human and monkey cells, vaccine, and
laboratory-adapted strains of MV may infect all tissues and organs
of humans and monkeys. If so, this tropism shift may have great
consequences on vaccine attenuation. In this context, de Vries et al.
(2010) indicated that only CD11c-positive cells were infected with
the EGFP-expressing vaccine strain via the aerosol route, suggest-
ing that vaccine strains do not use CD46 in vivo. However, when
the replication of vaccine and laboratory-adapted strains of MV
in monkeys is limited, it will be difﬁcult to identify infected cells
in tissues. Furthermore, the infection of vaccine and laboratory-
adapted strains of MV may be restricted because of mutations in
the P/C/V genes, which are important for antagonizing the host
IFN response (Gerlier and Valentin, 2009). Therefore, the tropism
shift that solely occurs via the H protein should be evaluated using
the wild-type MV expressing EGFP, which bears the H protein of a
vaccine strain, such as the IC/EdH strain we developed previously
(Takeuchi et al., 2002).

We recently infected cynomolgus monkeys with EGFP-
expressing wild-type or IC/EdH strains and found that SLAM-
expressing lymphocytes were the main targets of both strains,
indicating that CD46 does not act as a receptor for vaccine and

laboratory-adapted strains of MV in vivo (Figure 3; Takeuchi et al.,
2012). One possible explanation for the limited expansion of the
EGFP-expressing IC/EdH strain in vivo is the activation status of
lymphocytes. It is known that stimulated lymphocytes are efﬁ-
ciently infected with MV and that stimulated lymphocytes express
SLAM (Tatsuo et al., 2000). Thus, lymphocytes expressing SLAM
may appear to be infected with both strains. The EGFP-expressing
IC/EdH strain that entered into quiescent lymphocytes via the
CD46 may not grow well in those cells. Alternatively, the expression
level of CD46 in vivo may be too low to allow MV dissemina-
tion by cell–cell fusion, as it was reported that high CD46 den-
sity is required for MV-induced cell–cell fusion (Anderson et al.,
2004). For whatever the reason, the growth of the EGFP-expressing
IC/EdH strain was less efﬁcient than that of the EGFP-expressing
wild-type strain (Takeuchi et al., 2012), suggesting that the CD46-
recognition ability of vaccine and laboratory-adapted MV strains
plays a role in the MV attenuation. Further studies are required to
elucidate the relationship between CD46-recognition ability and
MV attenuation.

CONCLUSION
As described in this review, our IC323 strain, recovered from a plas-
mid carrying the full-genome cDNA of the IC-B strain, is now used
as a standard wild-type MV strain in MV research. Furthermore,
EGFP-expressing IC323 strains are ideal tools for the study of tis-
sue and organ tropism of wild-type MV in vivo. Although the use
of monkeys has several limitations, monkey models still provide
the only reliable animal model for the study of the pathogenesis
of MV in humans. The combination of wild-type and vaccine
