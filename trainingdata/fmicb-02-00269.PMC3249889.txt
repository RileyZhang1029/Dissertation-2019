Inﬂuenza A virus is an enveloped virus with a segmented, single-strand, negative-sense
RNA genome. Its virions show spherical or ﬁlamentous shapes of about 100 nm in diam-
eter and occasionally irregular morphology, which exempliﬁes the pleomorphic nature of
these virions. Each viral RNA segment forms a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), along
with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex and multiple copies of nucleoproteins;
the RNPs reside in the enveloped virions. Here, we focus on electron microscopic analy-
ses of inﬂuenza virions and RNPs. Based on the morphological and structural observations
obtained by using electron microscopic techniques, we present a model of the native
morphology of the inﬂuenza virion.

Keywords: inﬂuenza virus, morphology, electron microscopy

INTRODUCTION
Inﬂuenza A, B, and C viruses are members of the Orthomyx-
oviridae, which is a family of enveloped viruses with segmented,
single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genomes (Palese, 2007). They
are classiﬁed according to antigenic differences in their nucleopro-
tein (NP) and matrix protein (M1), which are major structural
components of their virions. Of the three members, Inﬂuenza A
viruses, which are further classiﬁed into 16 hemagglutinin (HA)
subtypes and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes on the basis of their
antigenic properties, cause annual epidemics in humans and recur-
ring pandemics that spread globally with severe consequences for
human health and the economy.

The genome of inﬂuenza A virus consists of eight single-
stranded, negative-sense RNA segments that form ribonucleo-
protein complexes (RNPs) together with the viral RNA (vRNA)-
dependent RNA polymerase complex [basic polymerase 1 (PB1),
basic polymerase 2 (PB2), and acidic polymerase (PA)] and many
nucleoprotein (NP) molecules. The genome encodes at least 12
viral proteins, most of which are necessary for efﬁcient virus
replication in host cells and for virion formation. During virus
infection, the virus attaches to receptors (i.e., sialic acid linked to
galactose) on the cell surface via HA virion surface proteins and
enters the cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The RNPs within
the virion are released into the cytoplasm by acidic pH-dependent
membrane fusion, again via the HA proteins, and are transported
to the nucleus of the infected cells. Unlike most negative-sense
RNA viruses, transcription and replication of the inﬂuenza virus
genome take place in the nucleus. After the RNPs are synthesized
in the nucleus, they are exported to the cytoplasm with the help of
two viral proteins, M1 (Bui et al., 1996, 2000) and nuclear export
protein (NEP/NS2; O’Neill et al., 1998; Ye et al., 1999; Baudin
et al., 2001), via the cellular chromosome region maintenance 1
(Crm1) protein-dependent pathway (Neumann et al., 2000; Elton
et al., 2001; Ma et al., 2001; Watanabe et al., 2001; Akarsu et al.,
2003; Iwatsuki-Horimoto et al., 2004). They are then transported

to the budding site of the apical plasma membrane of polarized
cells, through a Rab 11-dependent vesicular transport pathway
(Amorim et al., 2011; Eisfeld et al., 2011; Momose et al., 2011).
The transmembrane proteins HA, NA, and an ion channel protein
(M2) are conveyed to the budding site by a standard exocytic path-
way through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. M1
is presumed to interact with both the RNPs and the cytoplasmic
tails of HA, NA, and M2 and to act as a bridge between them at
the budding site (Zhang et al., 2000; McCown and Pekosz, 2005).
Eventually, all of the viral components, including the viral trans-
membrane proteins, M1, and RNPs, are orderly assembled into
progeny virions. The progeny virions are released from the apical
plasma membrane into the extracellular environment, where NA
plays an important role in cleaving sialic acids bound to receptors
on the cell surface and HA proteins on the progeny virions.

Although the morphology of inﬂuenza A virions, whether bud-
ding virions or puriﬁed virions, has been investigated extensively
for many years by using various electron microscopic methods,
knowledge of the virion structure remains limited, mainly due to
pleomorphism, which complicates morphological and structural
analyses and impedes investigators efforts to draw conclusions
about the native structure of the virion. However, recent electron
microscopic analyses have revealed several important morphologi-
cal and structural features of inﬂuenza virions, which provide valu-
able information about the native morphology of these structures.
This review summarizes the current progress in virion morphol-
ogy studies and presents a model of the likely native morphology
of inﬂuenza A virion.

THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE INFLUENZA A VIRION
Virions possess a lipid envelope that is derived from the host cel-
lular membrane during the budding. They are generally spherical
or elliptical in shape, ranging from approximately 80–120 nm in
diameter and are occasionally ﬁlamentous, reaching more than
20 μm in length. Sometimes, however, they take on an irregular

Inﬂuenza virion morphology

shape. Virions are covered with numerous membrane-spanning
glycoproteins, HA and NA, and small amounts of M2. The periph-
eral membrane protein, M1, which is one of the most abundant
viral proteins in the virion, binds to the lipid envelope to main-
tain virion morphology. The segmented genome is enclosed in the
virion in the form of the RNP. Although small amounts of NEP
are present within the virion (Yasuda et al., 1993), its localization
is unknown.

Most laboratory-adapted strains of inﬂuenza A virus are pre-
dominantly spherical or elliptical, whereas clinical isolates are
predominantly ﬁlamentous and their adaptation in eggs results in
the loss of this ﬁlamentous phenotype (Chu et al., 1949; Kilbourne
and Murphy, 1960). The ﬁlamentous phenotype is thought to be a
genetic trait, as shown by virus gene reassortment experiments
(Smirnov et al., 1991) and reverse genetics studies (Bourmak-
ina and Garcia-Sastre, 2003; Elleman and Barclay, 2004). Such
studies have demonstrated that the M1 and M2 proteins are impor-
tant determinants of ﬁlamentous virion formation (Hughey et al.,
1995; Roberts et al., 1998; Bourmakina and Garcia-Sastre, 2003).
In addition, the polarized cell phenotype and actin cytoskeleton
network also play important roles in the formation of ﬁlamen-
tous virions (Roberts and Compans, 1998), suggesting that several
factors are involved in determining virion morphology. The sig-
niﬁcance of the ﬁlamentous morphology for virus replication
and pathogenesis remains uncertain; however, the fact that clin-
ical isolates, independent of HA and NA subtype, consistently
form ﬁlamentous shapes strongly suggests that this ﬁlamentous
phenotype is essential for virus survival in nature. The ﬁlamen-
tous morphology may, for example, facilitate cell-to-cell trans-
mission of progeny virions in the respiratory mucosa of infected
individuals.

In addition to the spherical, elliptical, and ﬁlamentous viri-
ons, irregular-shaped virions are sometimes observed when using
negative-staining electron microscopy (negative-staining EM) of
puriﬁed virions (Figure 1; Stevenson and Biddle, 1966; Almeida
and Waterson, 1967; Wrigley, 1979). Interestingly, such virions
have never been reported when ultrathin-section transmission
electron microscopy (ultrathin-section EM) or scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) is used to view budding virions. This discrep-
ancy is thought to be partially due to artifacts caused during sample
preparation for negative-staining, since artifacts can be introduced
into fragile biological specimens on air drying (Nermut and Frank,
1971; Ruigrok et al., 1992). However, other artifacts may also be
included, because such irregular-shaped virions are also reported
when using cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) of puriﬁed virions
(Harris et al., 2006; Nayak et al., 2009), which does not involve air
drying. Earlier reports suggested that the pleomorphism is intro-
duced during the storage of virions at 4˚C after they are harvested
(Choppin et al., 1961; Nermut and Frank, 1971). More impor-
tantly, it was recently demonstrated that virion morphology is sub-
stantially affected by ultracentrifugation, which is often involved in
the negative-staining process, resulting in the appearance of mor-
phologically irregular virions (Sugita et al., 2011). When virions
are chemically ﬁxed with glutaraldehyde (GLA), which presum-
ably creates cross-links among the membrane-bound M1 proteins
that form the layer underneath the viral envelope as well as among
M1 proteins and the cytoplasmic tails of the HA, NA, and M2

transmembrane proteins, the virion morphology is relatively con-
served even after ultracentrifugation. This ﬁnding is consistent
with observations made when using ultrathin-section TEM and
SEM of budding virions, where morphologically irregular virions
have never been found; sample processing of the ultrathin-section
TEM and SEM usually begins with GLA ﬁxation, and does not
involve ultracentrifugation. Taken together, the pleomorphism
of inﬂuenza virions observed when using negative-staining EM
and cryoEM is an artifact that is mainly introduced during sam-
ple preparation procedures that involve ultracentrifugation and
storage.

RNPs WITHIN THE VIRION
The eight vRNA segments, which contain conserved sequences at
(cid:2)
their 3
ends that are partially complimentary to each other
and form the core promoter (Skehel and Hay, 1978; Robertson,
1979; Desselberger et al., 1980), range in size from 890 to 2341
bases. Each vRNA segment is separately encapsidated by NP to
form the RNP, which has a ﬂexible, twisted rod-like structure that
is folded back and coiled on itself. The rod-like RNPs are approx-
imately 12 nm in diameter, but vary in length from approximately
30–110 nm (Pons et al., 1969; Compans et al., 1972). The length
of each rod-like RNP correlates with the length of each vRNA
segment (Compans et al., 1972).

Inﬂuenza virion morphology

Although the morphology of the puriﬁed RNPs has been well
characterized, the conformation of RNPs inside virions had been
largely unknown for a long time. When virions were examined
by using negative-staining EM or cryoEM, a continuous strand
of 7–8 nm in diameter, which was regularly packed in the form
of a helix, was observed within disrupted virions (Hoyle et al.,
1961; Apostolov and Flewett, 1965; Schulze, 1972; Almeida and
Brand, 1975; Murti et al., 1980, 1992; Booy et al., 1985; Harris et al.,
2006). Although the strands were observed only at a low frequency,
they were the sole structure clearly visualized by using negative-
staining EM and cryoEM. Therefore, it was proposed that RNPs
exist as a single continuous helix, which would be fragmented
into multiple rod-like RNPs during the puriﬁcation process of
RNPs (Almeida and Brand, 1975; Murti et al., 1980). Later, how-
ever, it was demonstrated by use of negative-staining EM (Ruigrok
et al., 1989) and cryoEM (Calder et al., 2010), that the continuous
helix found within disrupted virions was a layer of M1 proteins
underneath the lipid envelope.

How, then, are the RNP fragments arranged within the virion?
By using thin-section EM, it is shown that progeny virions bud-
ding from the plasma membrane of infected cells contain a distinct
arrangement of RNPs (Oxford and Hockley, 1987; Noda et al.,
2006). The RNPs are always suspended from the top of the bud-
ding virions and are oriented perpendicular to the budding tip.
Many transversely sectioned budding virions contain eight RNPs,
in which a central RNP is consistently surrounded by seven oth-
ers. Serial transverse ultrathin-sections of whole budding virions
have revealed that the eight RNPs within a virion differ in length,
suggesting that the budding virion contains different kinds of
vRNAs (Compans et al., 1972). Filamentous virions also con-
tain eight RNPs arranged in this distinct pattern. Interestingly,
the eight RNPs are conﬁned to the top of the ﬁlamentous virion
and the reminder of the ﬁlamentous virion is empty, indicat-
ing that such ﬁlamentous virions do not randomly incorporate
multiple sets of eight RNPs (Noda et al., 2006). Recent cry-
oEM analyses of puriﬁed virions conﬁrmed that they contain
eight RNPs arranged in a distinct pattern (Harris et al., 2006;
Calder et al., 2010). Furthermore, the RNPs are restricted to one
end of the ﬁlamentous particles that are released from infected
cells, which is consistent with the observations made by using
ultrathin-section EM of budding virions (Noda et al., 2006). Thus,
virions, regardless of their shape, incorporate an organized set of
eight RNPs.

A MODEL OF A NATIVE INFLUENZA A VIRION
Based on recent microscopic analyses, a schematic diagram of a
native inﬂuenza virion is depicted in Figure 2. Whether spheri-
cal, elliptical (Figure 2 left), or ﬁlamentous (Figure 2 right), the
lipid-enveloped virions are regular in shape and covered with HA
and NA glycoproteins and M2 proteins. Abundant HA proteins
are distributed over the virion surface. Single NA proteins can
be observed anywhere on the virion surface, whereas a cluster
of NA proteins is also found at the end of the virion that is
opposite to the end where the RNPs are located (Calder et al.,
2010). Because the RNPs bind to the inner leaﬂet of the enve-
lope at the distal end of budding virion (Noda et al., 2006; Calder
et al., 2010), the NA cluster would play a role in release from

FIGURE 2 | Schematic diagram of inﬂuenza virions. Left, an elliptical
virion; right, a ﬁlamentous virion. Note that both virions contain an
organized set of eight RNPs at the end of the virion.

the infected cell by destroying the HA binding to receptors on
the cell surface. Given that membrane scission is caused by M2
proteins (Rossman et al., 2010), M2 proteins are likely located
at the proximal end of the budding virion, on the same side as
the NA cluster. In addition, the M2 protein plays an important
role in RNP incorporation (McCown and Pekosz, 2005; Iwatsuki-
Horimoto et al., 2006), suggesting that it should also be present
at the distal end of the budding virion, where the M2 protein
and RNPs could associate with each other. The M1 protein forms
a matrix layer underneath the lipid envelope that is arranged
as an ordered helix composed of multiple copies of M1 pro-
teins that contribute to the virion morphology (Calder et al.,
2010).

The eight rod-like RNPs, which differ in length, are arranged
in a distinct pattern, in which seven peripheral RNPs surround a
central RNP (Oxford and Hockley, 1987; Noda et al., 2006). Such
an arrangement is observed not only in budding virions, but also
in isolated virions (Harris et al., 2006; Calder et al., 2010), sug-
gesting that there are interactions among the RNPs to maintain
this organization. The eight RNPs are consistently associated with
the inner envelope at the distal end of the budding virion and
oriented almost perpendicular to the budding tip (Oxford and
Hockley, 1987; Noda et al., 2006), indicating a polar organization
of the virion.

Inﬂuenza virion morphology

CONCLUSION
Electron microscopic approaches are useful methods for investi-
gating morphological and structural features of viruses. However,
when fragile, lipid-enveloped viruses, including inﬂuenza viruses,
are examined by using electron microscopy, artifactual effects such
as ultracentrifugation, storage, and air drying should be consid-
ered. If not, misleading information can be visualized. Recent
electron microscopic analyses of inﬂuenza virions clearly show
that the native virion morphology is uniformly spherical, elliptical,
or ﬁlamentous. Irregularly shaped virus particles are mainly arti-
facts caused during sample processing, indicating that such virus
particles unlikely reﬂect the true virion structure. Accordingly, it is
important to pay close attention to sample processing, when struc-
turally examining inﬂuenza virions with electron microscopic
techniques.

Despite the fact that various electron microscopic analyses have
contributed to our knowledge of inﬂuenza virion morphology,

much about the internal structure of the virion remains unknown.
For instance, how do the RNPs associate with the envelope
at the tip of the virion? How are the eight RNPs arranged
in their distinct pattern? Do they interact with each other? If
so, where and how do they interact? Although solving these
issues by using conventional two-dimensional electron micro-
scopic methods, such as thin-section EM and negative-staining
EM would be difﬁcult, if not impossible, they can be addressed
by using three-dimensional analysis of RNPs within the virion by
means of electron tomography, which provides higher resolution
images.
