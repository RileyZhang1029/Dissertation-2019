The  purpose  of  the  present  study  was  to  investigate  the  influence  of  cultural  and  environmental  parameters  affecting  the
growth  and  bioactive  metabolite  production  of  the  rare  strain  VUK-10  of  actinomycete  Pseudonocardia,  which  exhibits  a
broad  spectrum  of  in  vitro  antimicrobial  activity  against  bacteria  and  fungi.  Production  of  bioactive  metabolites  by  the  strain
was  high  the  in  modified  yeast  extract-malt  extract-dextrose  (ISP-2)  broth,  as  compared  to  other  tested  media.  Glucose  (1%)
and  tryptone  (0.25%)  were  found  to  be  the  most  suitable  carbon  and  nitrogen  sources,  respectively,  for  optimum  production
of  growth  and  bioactive  metabolites.  Maximum  production  of  bioactive  metabolites  was  found  in  the  culture  medium  with
initial  pH  7  incubated  with  the  strain  for  four  days  at  30oC,  under  shaking  conditions.  This  is  the  first  report  on  the
optimization  of  bioactive  metabolites  by  Pseudonocardia  sp.  VUK-10.

Most  of  the  antibiotics  in  use  today  are  derivatives  of
natural products of actinomycetes and fungi [1]. Antibiotics
produced by actinomycetes and other microbes have been
evolving  for  one  billion  years  [2]  and  their  activity  has
been  tested  against  microbes  based  on  their  ability  to
inhibit target enzymes and macromolecules. Actinomycetes
can be isolated from soil and marine environments. Since
collecting  soil  is  relatively  inexpensive,  much  is  known
about 
terrestrial
actinomycetes.  Although  soils  have  been  screened  by  the
pharmaceutical  industry  for  the  past  five  decades,  only  a
small fraction of actinomycetes have been discovered [2].
Actinomycetes  from  unexplored  habitats  have  gained
considerable attention in recent years for the production of
bioactive metabolites. The list of novel actinomycetes and
products derived from  poorly  explored areas of  the  world
stresses  the  importance  of  investigating  new  habitats  [3].
Members  of  marine  actinomycetes  particularly  found  in
mangrove habitats have been poorly studied [4].

Mangroves  are  unique  woody  plant  communities  of
intertidal coasts in tropical and subtropical regions and are
highly  productive  ecosystems  [5].  Although  surprisingly
little  is  known  about  the  microbial  communities  present
there [6], there is evidence that mangrove sediments contain
high  populations  of  novel  actinomycetes,  as  illustrated  by

the  isolation  of  Asanoa  iriomotensis  [7]  and  Nonomuraea
maheshkhaliensis [8]. The most promising source of future
antibiotics  consists  of  natural  microbial  products  [9].  The
requirement  for  discovery  and  isolation  of  novel  chemical
structures from  unique untapped  niches is undisputed.  This
is  achieved  by  investigating  new  microbial  sources  for
production of antimicrobial agents from non-Streptomyces
actinomycetes [10].

In a screening program designed to discover antimicrobial
compounds  from  rare  actinomycetes,  Pseudonocardia  sp.
VUK-10 was isolated from soil sediments of Nizampatnam
mangrove  ecosystem.  The  bioactive  metabolite  profile
of  Pseudonocardia  spp.  includes  antibacterial,  antifungal,
enzyme  inhibitors,  neuroprotective  and  anti-Helicobacter
pylori  compounds.  A  new  phenazine  derivative  from
Pseudonocardia sp. B6273, i.e., phenazostatin D, acts as a
neuroprotective substance [11]. Omura et al. [12] reported
antimicrobial  activity  of  azureomycins  A  and  B  extracted
from P. azurea. Dekker et al. [13] extracted new quinolone
compounds  from  Pseudonocardia  sp.  with  selective  and
potent  anti-Helicobacter  pylori  activity.  The  ability  of
strains to form antimicrobial substances can be significantly
influenced by different conditions of nutrition and cultivation.
Therefore,  the  medium  constitution  together  with  the
metabolic  capacity  of  the  producing  microorganism  greatly

affects  synthesis  of  bioactive  metabolites.  Several
environmental  factors,  such  as  temperature,  pH,  and
incubation  period,  play  a  major  role  in  the  production  of
antimicrobial agents [14]. In this study, we tried to optimize
the  cultural  conditions  of  the  isolate  Pseudonocardia  sp.
and  facilitate  improved  production  of  biologically  active
compounds.

Materials  and  Methods

Pseudonocardia  sp.  VUK-10  was  isolated  from  soil
sediments  of  “Nizampatnam  Mangrove  Ecosystem”  of
south  coastal  Andhra  Pradesh,  India,  by  using  the  soil
dilution plate technique on asparagine-glucose agar medium
with  pH  7.2  [15].  The  pure  cultures  were  maintained  on
yeast  extract-malt  extract-dextrose  (YMD;  ISP-2)  agar
medium  at  4oC.  The  strain  has  been  deposited  in  the
NCBI  GenBank  with  the  accession  No.  JN087501.  The
test  organisms  used  in  the  present  study  were  procured
from  ATCC,  University  Boulevard,  Manassas,  USA  and
MTCC,  IMTECH,  Chandigarh,  India  and  preserved  at
4oC.

Growth  pattern  and  antimicrobial  profile. The  growth
pattern  and  antimicrobial  profile  of  Pseudonocardia  sp.
was  studied  at  regular  intervals  for  up  to  7  days.  The
strain  was  cultured  for  one  wk  and  then  transferred
aseptically into the seed medium (asparagine-glucose broth)
and incubated for 48 hr. 10% of the 24-hr-old seed culture
was  inoculated  into  the  production  medium  of  the  same
composition.  Fermentation  was  carried  out  at  28 ±  2oC
for  7  days,  under  centrifugation  at  120 rpm.  The  culture
broth  was  harvested  at  24 hr  intervals  and  biomass  was
expressed as mg/100 mL. The culture filtrate thus collected
was extracted with ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness
in  a  water  bath  at  80oC  [16].  The  production  of  bioactive
metabolites  was  assessed  by  measuring  the  diameter  of
the  inhibition  zone  against  Gram  positive  bacteria  -
Staphylococcus  aureus  (MTCC  497),  Bacillus  subtilis
(MTCC 3160) and Streptococcus mutans (MTCC 497) and
Gram  negative  bacteria  -  Escherichia  coli  (ATCC  35218)
and  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  (ATCC  9027),  as  well  as
Candida albicans (ATCC 10231).

Selection  of  the  culture  media  on  biomass  and
bioactive  metabolite  production. To  select  the  suitable
growth medium, the isolate actynomicete was grown in 11
different culture media, such as starch-casein broth, tyrosine
broth  (ISP-7),  glycerol-asparagine  broth,  starch  inorganic
salts  broth  (ISP-4),  yeast-starch  broth,  malt  extract  broth,
modified YMD broth (ISP-2), tryptone-yeast extract broth
(ISP-1),  maltose  tryptone  broth,  soya  bean  meal  broth
and  Czapek-Dox  broth  [17].  The  biomass  accumulation
and  bioactive  metabolite  production  for  the  media  were

determined  after  4th  day  of  incubation.  The  medium  in
which the strain exhibited maximum antibiotic production
expressed  in  terms  of  zone  of  inhibition  was  used  as  the
optimized medium for further study.

Effects of supplementary carbon and nitrogen sources on
biomass  and  bioactive  metabolite  production. Carbon
sources  such  as  maltose,  lactose,  fructose,  galactose,
sucrose, glucose, starch, mannitol, arabinose, xylose, glycerol,
and  raffinose  1%  were  supplemented  separately  into  the
fermentation  medium.  The  effect  of  varying  concentrations
(0.5~5%)  of  the  best  carbon  source  on  the  growth  and
bioactive  metabolite  production  was  also  investigated.
Similarly, various nitrogen  sources, such as sodium nitrate,
ammonium  sulfate,  ammonium  oxalate,  peptone,  tryptone,
casein, lysine,  asparagine,  arginine,  glutamine, and tyrosine
0.5% were individually supplemented into the fermentation
medium [18]. Further, the impact of different levels (0.1~
2%) of optimized nitrogen source was studied to enhance
antimicrobial metabolite production [19].

Effects of minerals on biomass and bioactive metabolite
production. To  evaluate  the  effects  of  minerals  on  the
growth and bioactive metabolite production, the optimized
medium  with  superior  carbon  and  nitrogen  sources  was
treated  separately  with  different  minerals,  such  as  KH2PO4,
MgSO4, FeSO4, K2HPO4, and ZnSO4, each at a concentration
of 0.05% (w/v) [20].

Effects  of  initial  pH  and  incubation  temperature  on
biomass  and  bioactive  metabolite  production. The
initial  pH  levels  of  the  growth  media  were  adjusted  from
4  to  10,  to  study  the  impact  of  pH.  The  biomass  and
bioactive  metabolite  production  were  estimated  and  the
optimum  pH  achieved  for  maximum  bioactive  metabolite
production  was  used for  subsequent  study  [21].  Similarly,
the  optimum  temperature  for  cell  growth  and  bioactive
metabolite yield  was measured by incubating the production
medium at temperatures ranging from 20oC to 60oC, while
maintaining all other conditions at optimum levels [22].

Test  organisms. The  antimicrobial  metabolites  of  the
strain produced under optimized conditions were tested by
the agar-diffusion assay against several bacteria, including
Streptococcus  mutans  (MTCC  497),  Lactobacillus  casei
(MTCC  1423),  Lactobacillus  acidophilus  (MTCC  495).
Enterococcus faecalis (MTCC 439), Staphylococcus aureus
(MTCC 3160), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), Escherichia
coli  (ATCC  35218),  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  (ATCC
9027),  Proteus  vulgaris  (MTCC  7299),  Shigella  flexneri
(MTCC 1457) and Xanthomonas campestris (MTCC 2286),
and  fungi,  such  as  Candida  albicans  (ATCC  10231),
Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum
(MTCC 3075), and Penicillum citrinum.

Results  and  Discussion

Growth  pattern  and  antimicrobial  profile. The
stationary phase of Pseudonocardia sp. VUK-10 extended
from  72 hr 
incubation.  The  bioactive
metabolites  obtained  from  4-day-old  culture  exhibited
high antimicrobial activity against the test microorganisms

to  120 hr  of 

(Fig.  1).  Sujatha  et  al.  [23]  reported  that  metabolites
elaborated 
from  4-day-old  culture  of  Streptomyces
psammoticus  showed  good  antimicrobial  activity  against
methicillin  resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus.  Similarly,
metabolites  collected  from  4-day-old  culture  of  Nocardia
levis MK_VL113 also exhibited good antimicrobial activity
[24].

significant at 5%.

Selection  of  culture  media  suitable  for  biomass  and
bioactive  metabolite  production. The 
influence  of
different media on the production of biomass and bioactive
metabolites was recorded (Fig. 2). Among the tested media,
modified  YMD  broth  increased  bioactive  metabolites,
followed by maltose-tryptone broth and Czapek-Dox broth,
whereas the production of biomass was high in Soya bean

meal  broth,  followed  by  Starch  inorganic  salts  broth  and
modified  YMD  (ISP-2)  broth.  Oskay  [21]  showed  that  the
activity  of  actinomycete  isolates  could  be  increased  or
decreased  remarkably  under  different  cultural  conditions.
Similarly,  Thakur  et  al.  [17]  reported  that  Thornton’s
medium 
increased  biomass  and  bioactive  metabolite
production of Streptomyces sp. 201.

Effects  of  supplementary  carbon  and  nitrogen  sources
on  biomass  and  bioactive  metabolite  production.
In
order to design the effective medium, the roles of different
carbon  and  nitrogen  sources  were  evaluated  for  their
impact  on  growth  and  bioactive  metabolite  production
(Figs. 3 and 4). Among the various carbon sources tested,
glucose  was  the  best  carbon  source  for  both  biomass  and
bioactive metabolite production. This result is comparable
with  that  from  a  previous  study  [25],  showing  that
Streptomyces  sannanensis  strain  RJT-1  utilized  glucose  as

the sole carbon source for antibiotic production. Similarly,
Cruz  et  al.  [26]  reported  that  the  antibiotic  production  of
S. griseocarneus was increased by glucose.

As  glucose  was  the  most  preferred  carbon  source  for
biomass and bioactive metabolite production by the strain,
different  levels  of  glucose  (0.5~5%)  were  tested  to
determine  optimal  concentration  for  bioactive  metabolite
production (Fig. 5). Two percentage glucose supplemented
in  the  medium  promoted  the  highest  biomass  production,
whereas 1% glucose was found to be the best for bioactive

metabolite  production.  Earlier  reports  also  suggested  that
antibiotic  production  was  observed  when  glucose  at  1%
concentration was used as sole source of carbon [27, 28].

Different nitrogen sources were found to have significant
effects on growth and secondary metabolite production by
Pseudonocardia  sp.  VUK-10.  Maximum  antimicrobial
activity was obtained in culture  filtrates supplemented with
tryptone,  followed  by  tyrosine  and  asparagine,  whereas
the  biomass  production  was  found  to  be  increased  with
tyrosine (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained with Nocardia
levis MK_VL113, as reported by Kavitha and Vijayalakshmi

[24].  Atta  et  al.  [29]  showed  that  optimal  antimicrobial
activity  was  obtained  with  0.25%  sodium  nitrate  in  the
culture medium of Streptomyces albidoflavus 143.

Effects of minerals on biomass and bioactive metabolite
production. The  impact  of  minerals  on  biomass  and
bioactive  metabolite  production  of  the  investigated  strain
is represented in Fig. 7. K2HPO4 enhanced the production
of  cell  mass  and  bioactive  metabolites.  In  contrast,  the
production  of  bioactive  metabolites  was  very  low  with
ZnSO4  and  FeSO4.  Majumdar  and  Majumdar  [30]  reported

Effects  of  initial  pH  and  incubation  temperature  on
biomass  and  bioactive  metabolite  production. The
environmental  requirements  and  cultural  conditions  for
growth  and  bioactive  metabolite  production  have  been
studied. Maximum growth, as well as increased antimicrobial
metabolites,  were  obtained  at  pH  7  (Fig.  8),  suggesting
the neutrophilic characteristics of the strain. Similar results
have been reported for several Streptomyces sp. [29].

The  influence  of  temperature  on  the  biomass  and
bioactive metabolite production of the strain is presented in
Fig. 9. Highest growth, as well as anti-microbial compound
production, was obtained at 35°C. In terms of its optimum
temperature  for  growth,  the  organism  appeared  to  be
mesophilic. These results are in complete accordance with
those reported by Narayana and Vijayalakshmi [20].

The results obtained in the present investigation revealed
that  both  the  growth  and  bioactive  metabolite  production
by Pseudonocardia sp. VUK-10 were mainly influenced by
several  environmental  and  cultural  conditions.  The  optimum
conditions for in vitro production of antimicrobial metabolites
could  be  achieved  in  medium  supplemented  with  glucose
at  10 g/L  as  carbon  source,  and  tryptone  at  2.5 g/L  as
nitrogen  source.  Four  days  of  incubation  at  35oC  and
pH  7  were  found  to  be  optimum  for  bioactive  metabolite
production (Table 1).

In the present study, optimal conditions for the production
of  bioactive  metabolites  by  Pseudonocardia  sp.  VUK-10
were determined, and metabolites showed good antimicrobial
activity  against  Gram  positive  and  Gram  negative  bacteria,
as well as unicellular and filamentous fungi. Hence, further
