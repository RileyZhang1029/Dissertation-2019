Pyrococcus furiosus grows optimally near 100˚C by fermenting carbohydrates to produce
hydrogen (H2) or, if elemental sulfur (S0) is present, hydrogen sulﬁde instead. It contains
two cytoplasmic hydrogenases, SHI and SHII, that use NADP(H) as an electron carrier and
a membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH) that utilizes the redox protein ferredoxin. We pre-
viously constructed deletion strains lacking SHI and/or SHII and showed that they exhibited
no obvious phenotype.This study has now been extended to include biochemical analyses
and growth studies using the ΔSHI and ΔSHII deletion strains together with strains lacking
a functional MBH (ΔmbhL). Hydrogenase activity in cytoplasmic extracts of various strains
demonstrate that SHI is responsible for most of the cytoplasmic hydrogenase activity. The
ΔmbhL strain showed no growth in the absence of S0, conﬁrming the hypothesis that, in
the absence of S0, MBH is the only enzyme that can dispose of reductant (in the form of
H2) generated during sugar oxidation. Under conditions of limiting sulfur, a small but sig-
niﬁcant amount of H2 was produced by the ΔmbhL strain, showing that SHI can produce
H2 from NADPH in vivo, although this does not enable growth of ΔmbhL in the absence
of S0. We propose that the physiological function of SHI is to recycle H2 and provide a link
between external H2 and the intracellular pool of NADPH needed for biosynthesis. This
likely has a distinct energetic advantage in the environment, but it is clearly not required
for growth of the organism under the usual laboratory conditions. The function of SHII,
however, remains unknown.

INTRODUCTION
Hydrogen gas (H2) plays an important role in anaerobic metab-
olism as the majority of anaerobes contain the enzyme hydro-
genase responsible for the reversible interconversion of mole-
cular hydrogen, protons, and electrons. Hydrogenases can be
grouped into three classes based on the metal composition of
their active site: [NiFe]-hydrogenases, [FeFe]-hydrogenases, and
the more recently deﬁned [Fe]-hydrogenases, so far restricted to
certain methanogenic organisms (Vignais et al., 2001; Shima and
Thauer, 2007). Organisms in the bacterial domain contain both
[NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenases, while archaeal organisms are
known to utilize [NiFe]- and [Fe]-hydrogenases (Vignais and Bil-
loud, 2007). Almost all of the anaerobic archaea contain one or
more [NiFe]-hydrogenases, implying that H2 metabolism plays an
important role in the extreme environments in which many of
these organisms are found (Vignais and Billoud, 2007).

Pyrococcus furiosus is a well-studied hyperthermophile belong-
ing to the order Thermococcales. It grows optimally at 100˚C by
peptide and carbohydrate fermentation with H2, organic acids,
and CO2 being the main fermentation products (Fiala and Stet-
ter, 1986; Kengen and Stams, 1994; Driskill et al., 1999; Adams
et al., 2001). P. furiosus degrades glucose via a modiﬁed Embden–
Meyerhof glycolytic pathway that utilizes the low potential electron

carrier protein ferredoxin (Fd) in place of NAD for all oxidative
steps, resulting in no overall substrate level ATP yield (Kengen
et al., 1994; de Vos et al., 1998; Verhees et al., 2004). Because of the

low redox potential of Fd (−480 mV), H2 production (−420 mV)

with Fd is thermodynamically favorable (Park et al., 1991; Smith
et al., 1995; Hagedoorn et al., 1998). Therefore, all reducing equiv-
alents generated in sugar metabolism can be disposed of as H2,
with production of up to 4 mol of H2 per mol glucose oxidized
(Verhees et al., 2004). The enzyme responsible for H2 formation is
a unique membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH) complex, which
uses the energy from this exergonic reaction to create an ion gra-
dient across the membrane that drives ATP synthesis, resulting in
the generation of an estimated 0.3 mol of ATP per mol H2 (Sapra
et al., 2003). This system is one of the simplest forms of respiration.
Besides MBH, P. furiosus also contains two cytoplasmic hydro-
genases (SHI and SHII), and these homologous enzymes each
consist of four subunits. Based on kinetic studies, SHI and SHII
are proposed to be involved in H2 recycling to provide NADPH
for biosynthesis (Ma and Adams, 2001b; van Haaster et al., 2008).
Pyrococcus furiosus can utilize carbohydrates for growth in
either the presence or absence of elemental sulfur (S0; Fiala and
Stetter, 1986; Adams et al., 2001). In the presence of S0, P. furio-
sus undergoes a major metabolic shift to utilize S0 as an electron

acceptor, thereby switching production from H2 to H2S. When
S0 becomes available, there is a dramatic decrease in the expres-
sion of all three hydrogenase operons correlated with a decrease in
hydrogenase activity, and concomitantly, there is a large increase in
expression of genes related to S0 reduction, such as those encod-
ing the membrane-bound oxidoreductase (MBX) as well as the
NAD(P)H-linked sulfur reductase (NSR; Adams et al., 2001; Schut
et al., 2007). The response to S0 is mediated at least in part by the
redox switch containing transcriptional regulator SurR (Lipscomb
et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010). MBX is highly homologous to MBH
and is thought to function analogously to MBH by using Fd as
an electron acceptor and conserving energy via formation of an
ion gradient (Silva et al., 2000; Schut et al., 2007; Bridger et al.,
2011). NSR has been proposed to reduce S0 synergistically with
MBX in which MBX can provide NADPH using Fd as electron
donor (Schut et al., 2007; Bridger et al., 2011).

In a previous study it was shown that strains containing dele-
tions of either SHI or SHII or both have no growth phenotype
under the conditions tested, suggesting that other enzyme(s), inde-
pendent of H2, can guide electrons from carbohydrate oxidation
to feed the NADPH pool (Lipscomb et al., 2011). This study has
now been extended to include strains containing a deletion of the
active subunit of MBH (mbhL) either alone or in combination
with deletions of the genes encoding both soluble hydrogenases.
Herein, we address the physiological function of all three hydroge-
nases in P. furiosus both in the absence and presence of sufﬁcient
and limiting concentrations of S0.

ΔSHIΔSHII) contain a deletion of

fore, a cassette containing pyrF expressed by the PEP syn-
thase promoter (123 bp) was used as the marker. The 500-
bp ﬂanking regions were ampliﬁed from wild-type gDNA
using the two primer sets WN011 (GTCATAAAACTAAAT-
GATGAGCATTTGACTTCATTTCTTCTCCCTC), WN013 (TTG-
GAGAAGAGAATTGCCCAAC), and WN012 (AGAATGGAGCT-
CAAGATAAATATGAAAATTGTATATGGAGTTATTGG), WN014
(AGACATCAACACACTGCTTACAC). The deletion construct for
mbhL was transformed into P. furiosus COM1 and ΔSHIΔSHII
selecting uracil prototrophy on solid deﬁned medium as previously
described (Lipscomb et al., 2011). To obtain mbhL deletions, solid
medium was supplemented with 8 mM polysulﬁde (equivalent to
approximately 1 g/L S0) or 2 mM polysulﬁde with solid S0 powder
sprinkled on the surface of the plate. The pyrF gene deleted in the
COM1, ΔSHI, ΔSHII, and ΔSHIΔSHII strains was restored to the
wild-type by transformation with a PCR product of the wild-type
pyrF locus containing ∼0.5 kb on either side of the gene. This was
done to ensure all strains were uracil prototrophic so growth could
be achieved in identical media. DNA was extracted from transfor-
mants as previously described (Lipscomb et al., 2011) and screened
for deletion by PCR ampliﬁcation of the locus using primers
outside the homologous ﬂanking regions used to construct the
deletions. Transformants were further colony puriﬁed by serial
passage on solid medium. Mutants were conﬁrmed by sequence
analysis of the mbhL region and qPCR analyses (see below).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STRAINS AND GROWTH CONDITIONS
The P. furiosus strains used or constructed in the study are listed
in Table 1. Growth medium was prepared as previously described
(Adams et al., 2001), and contained maltose (5 g/L) as the pri-
mary carbon source, supplemented with 0.5 g/L yeast extract, with
or without addition of S0 at 0.5 or 2 g/L. Growth experiments
were carried out in biological duplicates in 150-mL serum bot-
tles with 75 mL medium, with incubation at 95˚C and shaking
at 150 rpm. Cultures for cell-free extracts were grown in a 20-
L custom fermenter, and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared by
ultra-centrifugation as described previously (Adams et al., 2001).

RNA ISOLATION AND qPCR ANALYSES
Total RNA from various P. furiosus strains was obtained, and cDNA
was synthesized as previously described (Lipscomb et al., 2011).
Quantitative PCR was carried out using an Mx3000P instrument
(Agilent) and the Brilliant SYBR green qPCR master mix (Agilent)
with primers speciﬁc to the genes encoding SHI and SHII beta
subunits (PF0891 and PF1329), mbhK (PF1433), mbhL (PF1434),
mbhM (PF1435), and pyrF (PF1114), along with the constitutively
expressed genes encoding the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase
(POR) gamma subunit (PF0971) and DNA Polymerase (PF0983)
as internal controls. Successful gene deletions were veriﬁed by the
absence of a speciﬁc qPCR signal.

CONSTRUCTION OF GENE DELETIONS
Gene splicing by overlap extension and PCR (SOE–PCR; Hor-
ton et al., 1989) was used to construct a PCR product containing
0.5 kb regions upstream and downstream of mbhL on either

with deletions of SHI and SHII. Growth of these strains was com-
pared on maltose-based medium containing minimal yeast extract
with either no S0, limiting S0 (0.5 g/L), or sufﬁcient S0 (2 g/L). Both
mutants containing a deletion of mbhL displayed no detectable
growth in the absence of S0, but had no growth defect in the pres-
ence of sufﬁcient S0 (Figure 2). In the presence of limiting S0
(0.5 g/L), the MBH disruption strains exhibited ∼40% less ﬁnal
protein at the end of log phase, although growth rate was similar
to the parental strains initially. The strain devoid of all three hydro-
genases (ΔSHIΔSHIIΔmbhL) did not produce any detectable H2
under any of the growth conditions (Figure 3). With sufﬁcient
S0 (2 g/L) only a very small amount of H2 was produced in the
parental strains and in ΔmbhL (<5% of that produced in the

H2 analyses, headspace, and medium samples (500 μL each) were
taken at 6 and 9 h during growth and transferred anaerobically
into the double-vial system as previously reported (Schut et al.,
2007). H2S production was assayed by the methylene blue method
(Chen and Mortenson, 1977), and abiotic sulﬁde production was
subtracted from the experimental samples using control bottles
containing uninoculated medium. H2 production was measured
using a gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu, Columbia, MD,
USA). Hydrogenase activity in cell-free extracts was determined
by H2 production using sodium dithionite (5 mM) as the elec-
tron donor with methyl viologen (1 mM) as the electron carrier as
described previously (Ma and Adams, 2001b).

RESULTS
CHARACTERIZATION OF SHI AND SHII MUTANTS
We showed previously that strains containing deletions of either
of the two cytosolic NADP-linked hydrogenases (SHI and SHII)
alone or together did not produce any growth phenotype under
the conditions tested (Lipscomb et al., 2011). In order to verify the
effect of disruption of SHI and SHII on hydrogenase activity in
the cytoplasm, we prepared cell-free extracts from ΔSHI, ΔSHII
and ΔSHIΔSHII. The amount of hydrogenase activity (using the
artiﬁcial electron carrier methyl viologen) in cytoplasmic frac-
tions was not signiﬁcantly affected in the ΔSHII strain but was
much lower in the ΔSHI strain (<10% of that produced in the
parental strains), while in the ΔSHIΔSHII strain, no hydroge-
nase activity could be detected (Figure 1). These data indicate
that SHI is responsible for the majority of hydrogenase activity in
the cytoplasm and conﬁrms that the activity of the MBH is strictly
associated with the membrane (Sapra et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2000).

CHARACTERIZATION OF mbhL MUTANTS
We have constructed strains containing a deletion of the catalytic
subunit (mbhL) of the membrane-bound ferredoxin-linked H2-
producing hydrogenase (MBH), either alone or in combination

gradient for energy generation (Sapra et al., 2003; Verhees et al.,
2004). From this study involving all hydrogenases in P. furiosus, it
is clear that MBH is the only enzyme that produces H2 in wild-
type cells and that no alternative electron pathway is available to P.
furiosus that can allow for growth in the absence of S0. In addition,
no other enzyme (for example MBX) is capable of producing H2
in vivo, as shown by the lack of H2 formation in the strain lack-
ing all three hydrogenases. Similar observations were made for the
related archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis, in which the dis-
ruption of its MBH also did not allow growth under H2 evolving
conditions (Kanai et al., 2005, 2011; Santangelo et al., 2011). We
propose that the in vivo function of SHI is to recycle H2 for the
formation of NADPH needed for biosynthesis. Although in the
double deletion mutant lacking both SHI and SHII no hydroge-
nase activity was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction of cellular
extracts, no growth phenotype was observed when either or both
of these hydrogenases are absent (Lipscomb et al., 2011). In this
case other enzymes must provide the pool of NADPH, and a poten-
tial candidate is the ferredoxin:NADPH oxidoreductase (FNOR)
described previously (Ma and Adams, 2001a). In a previous study,
an SHI overexpression strain was constructed, and this strain also
did not display any obvious phenotype, although it contained
almost an order of magnitude more SHI activity (Chandrayan
et al., 2011). The relative amount of H2 produced in the strain
lacking both SHI and SHII was not signiﬁcantly different than
that in the parental strains (Figure 3). However, conﬂicting results
have been reported with a T. kodakaraensis deletion strain lacking
its SHI. One study found only a small increase in H2 production
(c.a. 10%; Kanai et al., 2011), which is more or less in agreement
with our results, while another reported over a ﬁvefold increase
in relative H2 production (Santangelo et al., 2011). Both studies
used similar growth media and H2 measurement methods, and it
is not clear why these studies give such different results. In gen-
eral, T. kodakaraensis displays growth yields and H2 production
rates similar to what has been observed in P. furiosus and other
Thermococcales (Kanai et al., 2005; Verhaart et al., 2010).

In the natural environment, the use of H2 recycling could
have a distinct energetic advantage because the cytosolic hydro-
genases could provide reductant in the form of NADPH without
interfering with the energy balance through electron transport
phosphorylation. However, we predict that there is a low level of
H2 recycling in P. furiosus when grown with maltose as the carbon
source, especially considering the low growth yields on this sub-
strate (25 g cdw/mol glucose utilized; Kengen and Stams, 1994).
Assuming all major cellular components (protein, nucleic acids,
and lipids) are synthesized de novo, we estimate about 6% H2
recycling (Kanehisa et al., 2004, 2008). In the laboratory setting
when these organisms are grown in nutrient rich conditions, H2
recycling would not be important to the overall growth of the
organism, and this may be the reason why there is a lack of phe-
notype for the SHI and SHII deletion strains. When SHI was ﬁrst
described, it was proposed to be responsible for the production of
H2, but the subsequent discovery of MBH called this into question
(Ma et al., 1993; Sapra et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2000). The generation
of H2 from NADPH is thermodynamically unfavorable; however,
in vitro this reaction can be easily demonstrated (Ma and Adams,
2001b; Verhaart et al., 2010). In this study, we have now shown that

absence of S0, Figure 3; Schut et al., 2007). With limiting S0, both
S0 is reduced and H2 is produced (c.a. 50% compared to no S0) in
the parental strains (Figures 2 and 3). Interestingly, when ΔmbhL
was grown with limiting S0, a small but signiﬁcant amount of
H2 was produced (c.a. 20% compared to the parental strains).
Therefore, the H2 produced in the ΔmbhL strain must be cat-
alyzed by SHI, showing that this cytosolic “uptake” hydrogenase
can also produce H2 from NADPH in vivo. A concentration of
0.5 g/L S0 (equivalent to ca. 15 mM) appears to be limiting for
the cell’s metabolism even though the cultures are continuously
shaken during growth. We observed signiﬁcant amounts of S0 left
in suspension in the culture medium after growth. Since only up
to 3 mM rather than 15 mM sulﬁde is produced in these cultures,
it appears that not all S0 in the medium is accessible to the cells.

DISCUSSION
The glycolytic pathway of P. furiosus only uses a low potential
ferredoxin that is linked to MBH, for the disposal of all reduc-
ing equivalents as H2, with simultaneous production of an ion

this reaction can actually take place in vivo, although at a low level
since SHI cannot compensate for the absence of MBH to allow
growth of the ΔmbhL mutant in the absence of S0.

Members of the order Thermococcales are characterized by the
ability to use S0 as an electron acceptor (Kelly and Adams, 1994).
We have previously shown that peptides can only be utilized by P.
furiosus (and likely most Thermococcales) in the presence of S0,
and we have concluded that S0 is the preferred electron acceptor
(Adams et al., 2001; Schut et al., 2007). When S0 is made available
to the cell, a rapid switch from H2 production to S0 metabolism
occurs, and this is orchestrated at least in part by the redox sensi-
tive SurR regulator (Schut et al., 2007; Lipscomb et al., 2009; Yang
et al., 2010). However, P. furiosus does not appear to possess a high
afﬁnity S0 binding system such as that described for Wolinella
succinogenes (Sud; Klimmek et al., 1998). From the results pre-
sented herein it appears that the addition of sufﬁcient S0 to a
maltose-based medium seems to consistently reduce the overall
cell yield (by c.a. 10–20%). At 0.5 g/L, S0 appears to be limiting to
the cells, but the overall concentration (15 mM “S” atoms) should

be sufﬁcient to provide the sole electron sink. In this case, the cells
are able to utilize both H2 and S0 metabolism simultaneously and
produce both H2 and H2S. This type of mixed H2 and S0 metab-
olism has also been observed for Staphylothermus marinus which
also contains orthologous MBH and MBX gene clusters (Hao and
Ma, 2003; Anderson et al., 2009). Altogether, this suggests that P.
furiosus has a relatively low afﬁnity for S0
, and that, when growing
on carbohydrates, it might actually prefer to generate H2 rather
than utilizing the poorly soluble S0 as an electron acceptor.
