Acidic wetlands are global sources of the atmospheric greenhouse gases methane (CH4),
and nitrous oxide (N2O). Consumption of both atmospheric gases has been observed in
various acidic wetlands, but information on the microbial mechanisms underlying these
phenomena is scarce. A substantial amount of CH4 is consumed in sub soil by aerobic
methanotrophs at anoxic–oxic interfaces (e.g., tissues of Sphagnum mosses, rhizosphere
of vascular plant roots). Methylocystis-related species are likely candidates that are involved
in the consumption of atmospheric CH4 in acidic wetlands. Oxygen availability regulates
the activity of methanotrophs of acidic wetlands. Other parameters impacting on the
methanotroph-mediated CH4 consumption have not been systematically evaluated. N2O
is produced and consumed by microbial denitriﬁcation, thus rendering acidic wetlands
as temporary sources or sinks for N2O. Denitriﬁer communities in such ecosystems are
diverse, and largely uncultured and/or new, and environmental factors that control their con-
sumption activity are unresolved. Analyses of the composition of N2O reductase genes
in acidic wetlands suggest that acid-tolerant Proteobacteria have the potential to mediate
N2O consumption in such soils. Thus, the fragmented current state of knowledge raises
open questions concerning methanotrophs and denitriﬁers that consume atmospheric CH4
and N2O in acidic wetlands.

INTRODUCTION
Microbial communities of acidic wetlands are responsible for
emissions of the potent greenhouse gases methane (CH4), and
nitrous oxide (N2O; Conrad, 1996; Whalen, 2005; Denman et al.,
2007). The largest single global source of atmospheric CH4 (100–
−1) are acidic wetlands, such as peat bogs and fens that
237 Gt year
cover 3.5% of the terrestrial surface, but store about 30% of global
carbon of terrestrial ecosystems (Gore, 1983; Denman et al., 2007).
Largest sources of atmospheric N2O are soils under natural veg-
etation and agricultural use; nonetheless, certain acidic wetlands
that have a high nitrogen content were recently identiﬁed as sig-
niﬁcant sources of N2O displaying N2O emissions in the range of
those observed for agricultural soils (Denman et al., 2007; Repo
et al., 2009; Marushchak et al., 2011). Conservative estimates sug-
gest that 0.6% of the global annual emission of N2O might be
attributed to such acidic wetlands (Repo et al., 2009).

Acidic wetlands are covered by water-adapted vascular plants,
and mosses of the genus Sphagnum (Gorham, 1991). Microbes that
produce CH4 are methanogenic Archaea, and those that are the
main source of N2O are denitriﬁers in anoxic habitats like wetlands
(Conrad, 1996; Ferry, 1999; Drake et al., 2009). CH4 produced by
methanogens is further oxidized by aerobic methanotrophs, which
thrive as a signiﬁcant part of wetland microbial communities and
mitigate the net CH4 ﬂux into the atmosphere (Hanson and Han-
son, 1996; Shannon et al., 1996; Whalen, 2005; Knorr et al., 2008;
Hornibrook et al., 2009). Atmospheric oxygen may penetrate soil
due to water table draw downs, and gas transport through the
aerenchyma of vascular plants into the rhizosphere (Moog and
Bruggemann, 1998; Kettunen et al., 1999; Mainiero and Kazda,

2005; Paul et al., 2006). Acidic wetlands may temporarily turn into
sinks of atmospheric CH4, or at least have the potential to consume
atmospheric CH4 (≤1.75 ppmv; Table 1; Whalen and Reeburgh,

2000; Jauhiainen et al., 2005; Elberling et al., 2011), a fact that is
currently underappreciated, and poorly understood on the level
of microbial communities.

Association of denitriﬁers with N2O production in nitrogen-
rich acidic wetlands is indicated by process-orientated studies of
water-logged acidic soils, and denitriﬁcation is suggested as the
primary N2O producing process in such systems where the water
ﬁlled pore space exceeds 70% (Davidson, 1991). Denitriﬁers cat-
alyze the sequential reduction of N-oxides to nitrous oxide (N2O)
and/or dinitrogen (N2) via the sequential action of nitrate, nitrite,
nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide reductases (Zumft, 1997). Sub-
units that contain the catalytic center are encoded by narG/napA,
nirK/nirS, norB, and nosZ. Dissimilatory reduction of nitrate via
nitrite to ammonium (DNRA) might produce N2O under oxygen
limited conditions via the unspeciﬁc interaction of nitrite with
nitrate reductase (Smith and Zimmermann, 1981; Smith, 1983).
However, DNRA potentials are low in acidic wetland soils, and free
nitrite is virtually absent from such soils, suggesting that DNRA is
negligible with regards to N2O production (Anderson and Leine,
1986; Bowden, 1987). Signiﬁcant products of chemodenitriﬁca-
tion are NO and NO2 rather than N2O (van Cleemput, 1998; Kap-
pelmeyer et al., 2003; Kresovic et al., 2009). N2O is also produced
as a by-product during the aerobic conversion of ammonia to
nitrate by nitriﬁers, but nitriﬁcation is the primary source of N2O
in oxic rather than water-logged soils (Davidson, 1991; Conrad,
1996). Despite the importance of denitriﬁers for N2O production

Microbial CH4 and N2O consumption

in water-logged soils and the wealth of information on denitriﬁers
of agricultural and pH-neutral upland soils, studies addressing
acid-tolerant denitriﬁers in acidic wetlands are just emerging and
under-represented in current literature. Evidence is accumulating
that soils including acidic wetlands can act as temporary sinks
for N2O (Inubushi et al., 2003; Hadi et al., 2005; Chapuis-Lardy
et al., 2007; Goldberg et al., 2010). Indeed, negative ﬂuxes of up
to −1.7 μmol N2O m
−1 were observed in situ for acidic wet-
lands (Table 1). Thus, the review intents to delineate the current
understanding of microbial communities in acidic wetlands for
CH4 and N2O consumption and to highlight research needs.

METHANOTROPHS OF ACIDIC WETLANDS
CH4 ﬂuxes of acidic wetlands are highly variable due to
non-linear interactions of environmental factors that control
methanogenesis, methanotrophy, and CH4 gas transport (Whalen,
2005; Spahni et al., 2011). One reason of high spatial and tempo-
ral variability of CH4 exchange with the atmosphere might be a
mitigation of net ﬂux by consumption of atmospheric CH4 (Wiec-
zorek et al., 2011). Hot spots of activity of methanotrophs in acidic
wetlands are anoxic–oxic interfaces, where CH4 and oxygen gra-
dients overlap (Sundh et al., 1995; Kettunen et al., 1999). Thus
changes in oxygen availability alter both CH4 consumption, and
production, and hence, reduce or increase net ﬂux of CH4 from
soil into the atmosphere (Kettunen et al., 1999; Whalen, 2005).

Prevalent methanotrophs of acidic wetlands belong to
Alphaproteobacteria (Chen et al., 2008a; Dedysh, 2009; Wiec-
zorek et al., 2011). Total cell numbers of methanotrophs of acidic
wetlands range from 106 to 108 cells per gram of wet weight
(Sundh et al., 1995; Dedysh et al., 2001, 2003; Dedysh, 2002,
2009; Belova et al., 2011). Methanotrophic pure cultures have pri-
marily been isolated from Sphagnum-covered wetlands, and are
acid-tolerant strains of Methylocystis (Methylocystaceae), Methy-
locella, and Methylocapsa (both Beijerinckiaceae; Dedysh et al.,
2001, 2003; Dedysh, 2002, 2009; Kip et al., 2011). Methylocella
species, and some species of Methylocystis and Methylocapsa uti-
lize also simple multicarbon compounds, such as acetate (Dedysh
et al., 2005; Theisen et al., 2005; Dunﬁeld et al., 2010; Belova et al.,
2011). Fluctuations of soil-internal methanogenesis may be caused
by varying exudation of plants and redox conditions due to water
table changes that can be consequences of drought periods, or
heavy rainfall (Knorr et al., 2008; Knorr and Blodau, 2009, Dorod-
nikov et al., 2011). Acetate-utilizing methanotrophs are largely
independent of such CH4 deﬁcits in acidic wetlands.

Methylocystis strain H2s apparently represents a key methan-
otroph in acidic wetlands (Belova et al., 2011; Wieczorek et al.,
2011). Strain H2s-related 16S rRNA genes ubiquitously occur in
northern wetlands, and contribute with 18–58% (i.e., 0.4× 107
to 3.4× 107 cells g
−1 of wet weight) to the alphaproteobacterial
methanotrophs in such wetlands (Belova et al., 2011). Uncul-
tivated species that are phylogenetically related to Methylocystis,
and Methylocapsa are associated with hyaline cells of submerged
mosses of Sphagnum. These Sphagnum methanotroph associa-
tions have been found in various northern wetlands (Kip et al.,
2010). Methanotrophs apparently contribute up to 30% to car-
bon assimilation of the moss (Raghoebarsing et al., 2005; Kip
et al., 2010; Larmola et al., 2010; Parmentier et al., 2011). The

association is, based on current observations, not speciﬁc since
different methanotroph-free Sphagnum species can be colonized
by methanotrophs that were provided from the same Sphagnum
individual (Larmola et al., 2010). The physiological basis of the
interaction between methanotroph and moss has not been fully
resolved.

Wetland methanotroph communities are usually dominated by
Alphaproteobacteria, but gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs
may also be present (Morris et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2008a,b;
Wieczorek et al., 2011). Some of them (Methylomonas-, Methy-
losoma-related strains) have been isolated, which represent the
ﬁrst acid-tolerant members of the Methylococcaceae (Kip et al.,
2011). All cultured methanotrophs of acidic wetlands are acid-
tolerant and have growth optima below pH6 (Dedysh, 2009; Kip
et al., 2011). Most information on the identities and physiologies
of methanotrophs of acidic wetlands are derived from Sphag-
num-associated microbial communities, but there is a lack of
information on vascular plant-associated methanotrophs in acidic
wetlands.

SPECIALIZED METHANOTROPHS MEDIATE CH4 SINK
ACTIVITY OF ACIDIC WETLANDS
Acidic wetlands may temporally turn into net sinks of atmospheric
CH4, which has been documented in various studies, or have the
capability to utilize atmospheric CH4 concentrations (Table 1;
Figure 1; Dedysh and Panikov, 1997; Kettunen et al., 1999; Whalen
and Reeburgh, 2000; Jauhiainen et al., 2005; Elberling et al., 2011;
Wieczorek et al., 2011). Many wetland sites have annual emission
−1 (Dalal and Allen, 2008)
rates of less than 3.8 mol CH4 ha
indicating not necessarily only low CH4 production, but also a
certain proportion of consumption of atmospheric CH4 over the
year.

−2 year

A very limited number of studies analyzed the composition of
methanotroph communities of acidic wetlands, and measured the
potential of the respective wetland to consume atmospheric CH4
(Table 1). Methylocystis species that were frequently detected in
acidic wetlands are closely related to the solely known methan-
otroph strains that are capable of consumption of atmospheric
CH4, i.e., strains LR1, SC2, and DWT (Dunﬁeld et al., 1999, 2002;
Kolb et al., 2005; Baani and Liesack, 2008; Dedysh, 2009; Wiec-
zorek et al., 2011). Nonetheless, pmoA2 genes (that encode for the
hydroxylase subunit of a high afﬁnity CH4 mono-oxygenase) that
would indicate the capability of consumption of atmospheric CH4
(Dunﬁeld et al., 2002; Yimga et al., 2003; Ricke et al., 2004; Baani
and Liesack, 2008) have only been detected at low relative abun-
dances (<5%; Wieczorek et al., 2011). To warrant consumption of
atmospheric CH4 in wetlands a small fraction (about 107 cells per
gram dry weight in forest soils that consume atmospheric CH4;
Kolb et al., 2005; Degelmann et al., 2010) of the total cell number
of present methanotrophs (about 108 cells per gram dry weight)
need presumably be active to allow for consumption of atmos-
pheric CH4 at rates that were observed in acidic wetland sites. The
major proportion of detectable pmoA (encodes the beta-subunit
of a low afﬁnity membrane bound CH4 mono-oxygenase) and
mmoX (encodes the hydroxylase subunit of a low afﬁnity cytoplas-
mic bound CH4 mono-oxygenase) genes in an acidic wetland soil
that exhibited the capability of consumption of atmospheric levels

of CH4 (i.e., 82 and 64%, respectively), afﬁliated with genes of
Methylocystis (Wieczorek et al., 2011). Some Methylocystis species
have the capability to utilize atmospheric CH4 concentrations. The
abundant Methylocystis strain H2s harbors as well pmoA2 indi-
cating that this methanotroph may consume atmospheric CH4
(Dedysh, personal communication). Thus, Methylocystis species
of acidic wetlands likely are capable of atmospheric CH4 con-
sumption (Figure 1), and may have the advantage to survive
more likely periods of CH4 deﬁciency, may be periodically the
case in minerotrophic fens, and at oxygen-saturated surface-near
soil layers.

Recently described thermoacidophilic methanotrophs of the
Methylacidiphilaceae (Op den Camp et al., 2009) as well as
anaerobic methanotrophs Candidatus “Methylomirabilis oxyfera”
(Ettwig et al., 2010) have not been detected in acidic wetlands.

FIGURE 1 | Proposed Model of Microbes that are responsible of
atmospheric sink function of CH4 and N2O in natural wetlands. The
quantitative contribution to global net ﬂuxes of CH4 and N2O into the
atmosphere has not been evaluated in acidic wetlands. (A) Acidic wetland
covered by Sphagnum plants with low nitrogen input and mineralization
rates. White Pathway: Plant-derived organic matter is degraded by microbial
fermentation, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis to CH4 that is
transported to oxygen-saturated zones close to the surface. The thickness
of the oxygen-saturated layer is dependent of water table level (white
dotted line). Methanotrophs (such as Methylocystyceae, Beijerinkiaceae,
but as well Methylococcaceae) consume up to 90% of methanogenic CH4.
Products are microbial biomass and CO2. The not-consumed proportion of
CH4 is released into the atmosphere. Methanotrophs convert CH4 to carbon
dioxide (CO2) which is released into the atmosphere. Yellow pathway:
Methylocystis species likely consume atmospheric CH4 when CH4 supply
from anoxic zones is limited. (B) Natural wetland with high nitrogen input
and mineralization rates (e.g., minerotrophic fens, Palsa peats). White
pathway: In nitrogen-rich acidic wetlands (e.g., Palsa peats) a part of
anaerobic organic matter degradation intermediates are consumed by
−
denitriﬁers that reduce NO
3 to N2O and N2. N2O and N2 is released into the
atmosphere. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are known to produce small
amounts of N2O during oxidation of ammonia (Schmidt et al., 2004; Braker
and Conrad, 2011). Yellow pathway: Under as-yet unresolved environmental
conditions atmospheric N2O may be further reduced to N2 by to date not
cultured denitriﬁers that use electrons from organic matter.

In summary, Methylocystis are likely involved for consumption of
atmospheric CH4 in acidic wetlands. Nonetheless, an unequivocal
experimental proof is missing. The role of other methanotrophs
in acidic wetlands (i.e., Beijerinckiaceae, and Methylococcaceae)
in consumption of atmospheric CH4 is not fully unresolved, but
not very likely based on their low afﬁnities for CH4. It is not likely
that “M. oxyfera” is involved in N2O cycling since it lacks nitric
oxide reductase.

DO DENITRIFIERS CONSUME N2O IN ACIDIC WETLANDS?
One of the most remarkable features of denitriﬁers is their capacity
to produce and consume N2O (Table 1; Figure 1; Zumft, 1997).
Such organisms are widely distributed in various environments
and highly diverse (e.g., Zumft, 1997; Braker and Conrad, 2011).
Not all denitriﬁers known to date are capable of N2O consumption
(Zumft and Kroneck, 2007). However, N2O is a common interme-
diate during denitriﬁcation and serves as sole electron acceptor
for supporting growth of many denitriﬁers (Zumft, 1997; Strohm
et al., 2007). DNA based stable isotope probing with 13C-labeled
succinate as electron donor and N2O as electron acceptor and
cultivation-based studies demonstrated growth of putative den-
itriﬁers by N2O reduction in rice ﬁeld soil (Ishii et al., 2011).
(cid:3)
These ﬁndings are in line with a ΔG
0 of N2O reduction to N2 that
approximates −340 kJ mol
−1 under standard conditions, indicat-
ing a highly exergonic process (Zumft and Kroneck, 2007). Thus,
it might not be surprising that N2O consumption by soil commu-
nities is a more common phenomenon than previously thought
(Table 1; reviewed in Holtan-Hartwig et al., 2000; Chapuis-Lardy
et al., 2007).

N2O reductases of denitriﬁers catalyze the efﬁcient reduc-
tion of N2O to N2 and are copper-dependent metallo-enzymes
that exhibit K M values in the lower micromolar range for N2O,
highlighting the potential of denitriﬁers to consume low con-
centrations of N2O (Zumft, 1997). Abiotic conversion of N2O
at ambient temperatures might occur with (reduced) transition-
metal complexes (which occur in the active site of N2O convert-
ing enzymes) and metal amides (Banks et al., 1968; Zumft and
Kroneck, 2007). Metallo-enzymes like carbon monoxide dehydro-
genase and cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase are also
capable of reducing N2O to N2, while nitrogenase converts N2O
to NH3; bacterial nitrite cytochrome c reductase transforms N2O
to an unknown product (Jensen and Burris, 1986; Bannerjee
and Matthews, 1990; Lu and Ragsdale, 1991; Drummond and
Matthews, 1994; Stach et al., 2000). Such enzymes are hosted
by diverse organisms including non-denitriﬁers (see references in
Zumft, 1997; Zumft and Kroneck, 2007). However, the conversion
of N2O by these aforementioned enzymes is regarded as a non-
physiological reaction. Low K M values and high speciﬁc activities
for N2O (as were demonstrated for N2O reductases of denitri-
ﬁers) have not been demonstrated for such enzymes, suggesting a
minor role, if any, for the consumption of atmospheric N2O con-
centrations (319 ppb, equivalent to app. 8 nmol N2O per liter soil
solution; Conrad, 1996) in soils (Zumft, 1997; Stach et al., 2000;
Zumft and Kroneck, 2007). In this context, dissimilatory reducers
of nitrate producing ammonia of the Enterobacteriaceae that were
shown to consume N2O in the laboratory displayed a K M value
of 3 mM for N2O, likewise suggesting that the N2O reduction is

Microbial CH4 and N2O consumption

a non-physiological reaction and probably of minor importance
in situ (Kaldorf et al., 1993). Moreover, assimilatory reduction of
N2O that might theoretically proceed via nitrogenase action was
not detected in soils (Vieten et al., 2008). Thus, denitriﬁers hosting
N2O reductases deserve primary attention in the context of N2O
consumption in soils.

Denitriﬁcation rates and the ratio of N2O to total nitrogen
gas products are regulated by oxygen availability, pH, tempera-
ture, carbon to nitrogen ratio, the availability of substrates, and
electron acceptors, as well as by the denitriﬁer community com-
position (van Cleemput, 1998; Dörsch et al., 2011). Anoxia (as
indicated by a water ﬁlled pore space of greater than 60%), a
carbon to nitrogen ratio greater than 30, and pH-neutral condi-
tions favor complete denitriﬁcation to N2 in soils including acidic
wetlands (Conrad, 1995, 1996; Klemedtsson et al., 2005; Cuhel
et al., 2010; Braker and Conrad, 2011). A pH value below 5 is
often encountered in peatlands, and is hypothesized to impair
N2O reduction and to increase the product ratio of N2O to N2
(Simek and Cooper, 2002; Cuhel et al., 2010). However, acidic
wetlands host acid-tolerant denitriﬁers capable of N2O reduction
and complete denitriﬁcation (Palmer et al., 2010, 2011). Moreover,
evidence of active denitriﬁcation-associated N2O production and
consumption, (including consumption of atmospheric N2O con-
centrations) was obtained by compound speciﬁc stable isotope
analyses of N2O in one acidic wetland (Goldberg et al., 2008,
2010). In that speciﬁc wetland, δ15N values indicated that N2O
produced in deep soil layers was partially consumed upon its dif-
fusion to the soil surface (Goldberg et al., 2008, 2010), suggesting
that denitriﬁers might contribute to the mitigation of N2O emis-
sion from acidic wetlands. Denitriﬁers that exhibit the genetic
potential to consume N2O were detected in acidic wetlands by
the analysis of nosZ genes. Detected nosZ genes in acidic wet-
lands mostly afﬁliated with nosZ from uncultured soil bacteria or
were only distantly related to known genes, suggesting a wealth of
uncultured denitriﬁer diversity in acidic wetlands (Palmer et al.,
2010, 2011). Phylogenies of nosZ and 16S rRNA genes from the
same organisms are basically congruent (Jones et al., 2008; Palmer
et al., 2009), allowing to speculate on the identity of organisms
hosting the detected nosZ. Thus, putative N2O reducers in acidic
wetlands include Alphaproteobacteria (Azospirillum, Brady-, and

to be determined whether the detected N2O reductase genes
were expressed, i.e., the detected organisms reduce N2O in situ
(Figure 1).

Analyses of other genes associated with denitriﬁcation corrob-
orate that acidic wetlands harbor diverse and new denitriﬁers
(Palmer et al., 2010, 2011). However, given the low number of
studies addressing N2O-consuming denitriﬁer communities in
acidic wetlands, and the selectivity of PCR-based gene marker
analyses, the present studies have to be regarded as providing
a minimal estimate of denitriﬁer diversity capable of N2O con-
sumption (Throback et al., 2004; Green et al., 2010; Heylen et al.,
2011; Jones et al., 2011). The fact that high afﬁnity respiratory N2O
reduction occurs in non-denitrifying organisms that reduce nitrate
but lack nitrite reductase activity, and that nitriﬁers were shown
to have the capability to consume N2O and produce N2 further
complicates matters (Yoshinari, 1980; McEwan et al., 1985; Zumft,
1997; Schmidt et al., 2004). Nevertheless, the relevance of N2O
consumption for mitigation of N2O emissions, and eventually a
temporary sink function of acidic wetlands for N2O is emerg-
ing, although the physiology and taxonomic identity of “microbial
catalysts” have not been sufﬁciently resolved. Furthermore, the
regulation of N2O reduction in situ and on cellular level, and thus
the potential of the soil to reduce N2O to N2, and the diffusivity
of N2O within the soil proﬁle will impact the sink functions of
wetland soils for N2O but are likewise only poorly resolved.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Few studies addressed the role of methanotrophs and den-
itriﬁers in consumption of atmospheric CH4 and N2O in
acidic wetlands. Potential consumption activities have been mea-
sured in laboratory-scale experiments, and ﬁrst evidence for
denitriﬁcation-associated N2O consumption in situ is available.
Systematic in situ ﬂux measurements combined with measure-
ments of environmental parameters, consumption potentials, sta-
ble isotope signatures of carbon and nitrogen in CH4 and N2O
pools, and community analyses are needed to improve our under-
standing of environmental factors that trigger CH4 and N2O
consumption in acidic wetland soils.
