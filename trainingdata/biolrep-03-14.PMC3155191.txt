Abstract
Making trade-offs between ecological services and other contributors to human well-being is a difficult
but critical process that requires valuation. This allows both better recognition of the ecological, social,
and economic trade-offs and also allows us to bill those who use up or destroy ecological services and
reward those that produce or enhance them. It also aids improved ecosystems policy. In this paper we
clarify some of the controversies in defining the contributions to human well-being from functioning
ecosystems, many of which people are not even aware of. We go on to describe the applicability of the
various valuation methods that can be used in estimating the benefits of ecosystem services. Finally, we
describe some recent case studies and lay out the research agenda for ecosystem services analysis,
modeling, and valuation going forward.

Ecosystem services
“Ecosystem services” are the benefits people derive from
functioning ecosystems, the ecological characteristics,
functions, or processes that directly or indirectly contri-
bute to human well-being [1,2]. Ecosystem processes
and functions may contribute to ecosystem services, but
they are not synonymous as they describe biophysical
relationships (such as the carbon cycle) and exist
regardless of whether or not humans benefit [3,4].
Ecosystem services, on the other hand, only exist if they
contribute to human well-being and cannot be defined
independently [5].

The ecosystems that provide the services are sometimes
referred to as “natural capital,” using the general definition
of capital as a stock that yields a flow of services over

time [6]. In order for these benefits to be realized, natural
capital (natural ecosystems and their products that do not
require human activity to build or maintain, such as fish
stocks) must be combined with other forms of capital that
do require human intervention to build and maintain.
These include: built or manufactured capital (e.g., fishing
boats); human capital (e.g., human labor and knowledge
about how to fish); and social capital (e.g., fishing
communities and cultures) [7].

These four general types of capital are all required in
complex combinations to produce any and all human
benefits. Ecosystem services can thus be defined as the
relative contribution of natural capital to the production
of human benefits, in combination with the three other
forms of capital. These benefits can involve the use,

option to use, or mere appreciation of the existence of
natural capital.

The following categorization of ecosystem services has
been used by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [2]:

(a) Provisioning services—ecosystem services that
combine with built, human, and social capital
to
produce food, timber, fiber, or other “provisioning”
benefits. For example, fish delivered to people as food
require fishing boats (built capital), fisherfolk (human
capital), and fishing communities (social capital) to
produce.

(b) Regulating services—services that regulate different
aspects of the integrated system. These are services that
combine with the other three capitals to produce flood
control, storm protection, water regulation, human
disease regulation, water purification, air quality main-
tenance, pollination, pest control, and climate control.
For example, the storm protection services of coastal
wetlands require the wetlands and the built infrastruc-
ture, people, and communities to be protected. These
services are generally not marketed but have clear value
to society.

(c) Cultural services—ecosystem services that combine
to produce
with built, human, and social capital
recreation, aesthetic, scientific, cultural
identity, or
other “cultural” benefits. For example, to produce a
recreational benefit requires a beautiful natural asset (a
lake), in combination with built infrastructure (a road,
trail, dock, and so on), human capital (people able to
appreciate the lake experience), and social capital
(family, friends, and institutions that make the lake
accessible and safe).

(d) Supporting “services”—services that maintain basic
ecosystem processes and functions such as soil forma-
tion, carbon fixation, and habitat for animals. These
services affect human well-being indirectly by maintain-
ing processes necessary for provisioning, regulating, and
cultural services. They also refer to the ecosystem services
that have not yet been combined with built, human, and
social capital to produce human benefits but never-
theless underlie these benefits. For example, net primary
production is an ecosystem function that supports
carbon sequestration and removal from the atmosphere,
which combines with built, human, and social capital to
provide the benefit of climate regulation. Some would
argue that these “supporting” services should rightly be
defined as ecosystem “functions”, since they may not yet
have interacted with the other three forms of capital to
create benefits. We agree with this in principle, but

recognize that supporting services/functions may some-
times be used as proxies for services in the other
categories, such as when the benefits cannot be easily
measured directly.

This categorization leads to a very broad definition of
services, limited only by the requirement of a contribution
to human well-being. Even without any subsequent
valuation, explicitly listing the services derived from an
ecosystem can help ensure appropriate recognition of their
importance. This can help make the analysis of ecological
systems more transparent and can help decision makers
weigh up the relative merits of the different options before
them.

Valuation
Many ecosystem services are public goods. This means
that multiple users can simultaneously benefit from
using them and it is difficult to exclude people from
benefiting from them. This creates circumstances where
analyzing individual choices is not the most appropriate
way to assess an ecosystem’s value and use. Instead, some
form of community or group choice process is needed.
As ecosystem services (being public goods) are generally
not traded in markets, we need to develop other methods
to assess their value.

There are a number of methods that can be used to
estimate or measure benefits from ecosystems. Valuation
can be expressed in several ways,
including money,
physical units, or indices. Economists have developed a
number of valuation methods that typically use mone-
tary units (see [8]) while ecologists and others have
developed measures expressed in a variety of nonmone-
tary units such as biophysical trade-offs (cf. [9]) and
qualitative analyses.

There are two main methods for estimating monetary
values: revealed and stated preferences. Both of theses
typically involve the use of sophisticated statistical
methods to tease out the values [10]. Revealed preference
methods involve analyzing individuals’ choices in real-
world settings and inferring value from those observed
choices. Examples include production-oriented valua-
tion that looks at changes in direct-use values from
products actually extracted from the environment (e.g.,
fish trawled from the sea). This method may also be
applicable to indirect-use values, such as the benefits
forests provide to agricultural production by controlling
soil erosion. Other revealed preference methods infer
ecosystem service values from resulting changes in
housing markets. For example, urban forest ecosystems
and wetlands may improve water quality and that may
be (partially) captured in property values [11]. The travel

cost valuation method is used to value recreation
ecosystem services based on the resources, money, and
time visitors spend visiting recreation sites.

Stated preference methods rely on individuals’ responses
to hypothetical scenarios involving ecosystem services
and include contingent valuation and structured choice
experiments. Contingent valuation uses a highly struc-
tured survey methodology that asks respondents to value
ecosystem improvements (e.g., better stream quality)
and the ecosystem services they will generate (e.g.,
increased salmon stocks) [12].

Choice experiments present respondents with scenarios
that embody combinations of ecosystem services and
monetary costs and ask for the most preferred scenarios
to infer ecosystem service values.

A key challenge in any valuation is imperfect informa-
tion. Individuals might, for example, place no value on
an ecosystem service if they do not know the role that the
service is playing in their well-being [13]. Here is an
analogy. If a tree falls in the forest and there is no one
around to hear it, does it still make a sound? The answer
to this old question obviously depends on how one
defines “sound”. If “sound” is defined as the perception
of sound waves by people, then the answer is no. If
“sound” is defined as the pattern of physical energy in the
air, then the answer is yes. In this second case, choices in
both revealed and stated preference models would not
reflect the true benefit of ecosystem services. Another key
challenge is accurately measuring the functioning of the
system to correctly quantify the amount of a given service
derived from that system (e.g., [14,15]).

But recognizing the importance of information does not
obviate the limitations of obtaining it. As the tree analogy
demonstrates, perceived value can be quite a limiting
valuation criterion, because natural capital can provide
positive contributions to human well-being that are either
never or only vaguely perceived, or may only manifest
themselves at a future time. A broader notion of value
allows a more comprehensive view of value and benefits,
including, for example, valuation relative to alternative
goals, such as fairness and sustainability, within the
broader goal of human well-being [16]. Whether these
values are perceived or not and how well or accurately
they can be measured are separate (and important)
questions.

Case studies
Early valuation syntheses
Scientists and economists have discussed the general
concepts behind natural capital, ecosystem services, and

their value for decades, with some early work dating as
far back as the 1920s. However,
the first explicit
mention of the term “ecosystem services” in the peer-
reviewed scientific literature was in a paper by Ehrlich
and Mooney in 1983 [17]. More than 2,400 papers have
been published on the topic of ecosystem services since
then, according to a search of the Institute for Scientific
Information’s “Web of Science” database, accessed on
February 22, 2011. This database includes only a subset
of scientific journals and no books, so it represents only
a subset of the literature on this topic. The first mention
of the term “natural capital” in the scientific literature
was in a paper by Costanza and Daly in 1992 [6].

One of the first studies to estimate the value of ecosystem
services globally was published in Nature and entitled
“The value of the world’s ecosystem services and natural
capital” [1]. This paper estimated the value of 17
ecosystem services for 16 biomes to be in the range of
US$16–54 trillion per year, with an average of US$33
trillion per year, a figure larger than the annual gross
domestic product (GDP) at the time. Some have argued
that global society would not be able to pay more than
their annual income for these services, so a value larger
than global GDP does not make sense. However, not all
benefits are picked up in GDP, so it should not represent
a limit on real benefits [18].

In this study, estimates of global ecosystem services were
derived from a synthesis of previous studies that utilized
a wide variety of techniques, such as those mentioned
above, to value specific ecosystem services in specific
biomes (see [19] for a collection of commentaries and
critiques of the methodology). This technique, called
“benefit transfer”, uses studies that have been done at
other locations or in different contexts, but can be
applied with some modification. Such a methodology,
although useful as an initial estimate, is just a first cut
and much progress has been made since then (cf.
[20-22]).

Major world reports on ecosystem services
More recently the concept of ecosystem services gained
attention with a broader academic audience and the
public when the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment was
published [2]. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
was a 4-year, 1,300-scientist study commissioned by the
United Nations in 2005. The report analyzed the state of
the world’s ecosystem services and provided recommen-
dations for policy makers. It determined that human
actions have depleted the world’s natural capital to the
point
the globe’s
ecosystems to sustain future generations can no longer
be taken for granted.

In 2008, a second international study was published on
The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity [23]
hosted by United Nations Environment Programme.
The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity’s primary
purpose was to draw attention to the global economic
benefits of biodiversity, to highlight the growing costs of
biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, and to draw
together expertise from the fields of science, economics,
and policy to enable practical actions moving forward.
The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity report
was picked up extensively by the mass media, bringing
ecosystem services to a broad audience.

The Ecosystem Services Partnership and ongoing work
With such high profile reports being published,
ecosystem services have entered not only the public
media [24] but also into business. Just one example is
the Dow Chemical Company’s recently established US
$10 million collaboration with The Nature Conservancy
to tally up the ecosystem costs and benefits of every
business decision [25]. Such collaborations will provide
a significant addition to ecosystem services valuation
knowledge and techniques. However, there is significant
research that is still required (see below). Our scientific
institutions can help lead this process through transdis-
ciplinary graduate education, such as the Ecosystem
Services for Urbanizing Regions program funded by the
National Science Foundation’s Integrative Graduate
Education and Research Traineeship program [26].

Hundreds of projects and groups are currently working
toward better understanding, modeling, valuation, and
management of ecosystem services and natural capital. It
would be impossible to list all of them here, but the new
Ecosystem Services Partnership [27] is a global network
that does just that and helps to coordinate the activities
and build consensus. The following lays out the research
agenda as agreed to by a group of 30 participants at a
meeting in Salzau, Germany, in June 2010, at the launch
of the Ecosystem Services Partnership.

Integrated measurement, modeling, valuation,
and decision science in support of ecosystem
services
The scientific community needs to continue to develop
better methods to measure, monitor, map, model, and
value ecosystem services at several scales [28]. Ideally, these
efforts should take place using interdisciplinary teams
and strategies and in close collaboration with ecosystem
stakeholders. Moreover, this information must be provided
to decision makers in an appropriate, transparent, and
viable way, to clearly identify the different outcomes of
different policies (i.e., [4]). At the same time, we cannot
wait for high levels of certainty and precision to act when

confronting significant irreversible and catastrophic con-
sequences. We must synergistically continue to improve the
measurements with evolving institutions and approaches
that can effectively utilize these measurements.

Trade-offs
Ecological conflicts arise from two sources: (a) scarcity
and restrictions in the amount of ecosystem services that
can be provided and (b) the distribution of the costs and
benefits of the provisioning of the ecosystem services.
Ecosystem services science makes trade-offs explicit and,
thus, facilitates management and planning. It enables
stakeholders to make sound value judgments. Ecosystem
services science thus generates relevant socioecological
knowledge for stakeholders and other decision makers
and generates sets of planning options that can help
resolve sociopolitical conflicts.

Accounting and assessment
Accounting attempts to look at the flow of materials with
relative objectivity, while assessment evaluates a system
or process with a goal in mind and is more normative.
Both are integrating frameworks with distinctive roles.
Both ecosystem service accounting and assessment need
to be developed and pursued using a broader lens that
includes social, economic, and ecological components.
Within the broader lens we also need to balance expert
and local knowledge across scales.

Modeling
We need to improve modeling to synthesize and quantify
our understanding of ecosystem services and to under-
stand dynamic, nonlinear, spatially explicit trade-offs as
part of the larger socioecological systems. Stakeholders
should be active collaborators in this model development
and testing process to assure relevancy. These models can
incorporate and aid accounting and assessment exercises
and link directly with the policy process at multiple time
and space scales. In particular, modeling can quantify
potential shifts in ecosystem services under different
environmental and socioeconomic scenarios.

Bundling
Most ecosystem services are produced as joint products
(or bundles) from intact ecosystems. The relative rates of
production of each service vary from system to system,
site to site, and time to time. We must consider the full
range of services and the characteristics of their bundling
in order to prevent creating dysfunctional incentives and
to maximize the net benefits to society [29,30]. As an
illustration, focusing only on the carbon sequestration
service of ecosystems may in some instances reduce the
overall value of the full range of ecosystem services; for
example, by reducing biodiversity.

Scaling
Ecosystem services are relevant over a broad range of scales
in space, time, governance, and complexity, including the
legacy of past behavior. We need measurement, models,
accounts, assessments, and policy discussions that address
these multiple scales, as well as interactions, feedbacks,
and hierarchies among them.

Adaptive management and new institutions
for ecosystem services
Given that pervasive uncertainty always exists in ecosystem
service measurement, monitoring, modeling, valuation,
and management, we should continuously gather and
integrate appropriate information regarding ecosystem
services, with the goal of learning and adaptive improve-
ment. To do this we should constantly evaluate the impacts
of existing systems and, with stakeholder participation,
design new systems to experiment with how we can more
effectively quantify performance, and learn ways to better
manage such complex systems to achieve social goals.

Property rights
Given the public-goods nature of most ecosystem
services, we need institutions that can effectively deal
with this characteristic using a sophisticated suite of
property-rights regimes. We need institutions that
employ an appropriate combination of private, state,
and common property-rights systems to establish clear
property rights over ecosystems without privatizing
them. Systems of payment for ecosystem services and
common asset trusts can be effective elements in these
institutions.

Scale-matching
The scale of the institutions to manage ecosystem services
must be matched with the scales of the services them-
selves. Mutually reinforcing institutions at local, regional,
and global scales over short, medium, and long time scales
will be required. Institutions should be designed to ensure
the flow of information across scales, to take ownership
regimes, cultures, and actors into account, and to fully
internalize costs and benefits.

Distribution
Systems should be designed to ensure inclusion of the
poor, since they are generally more dependent on
common property assets like ecosystem services. Free-
riding, especially by wealthier segments of society, should
be deterred, and beneficiaries should pay for the services
they receive from biodiverse and productive ecosystems.

Information dissemination
One key limiting factor in sustaining natural capital is
lack of knowledge of how ecosystems function and how

they support human well-being. This can be overcome
with targeted educational campaigns that are tailored to
disseminate success and failures to both the general
public and officials and through collaboration among
public, private, and government entities.

Participation
Relevant stakeholders (local, regional, national, and
global) should be engaged in the formulation and
implementation of management decisions. Full stake-
holder awareness and participation not only improves
ecosystem services analyses, but contributes to credible,
accepted rules that identify and assign the corresponding
responsibilities appropriately, and that can be effectively
enforced.

Science/policy interface
Ecosystem services concepts can be an effective link
between science and policy by making the trade-offs
more transparent [4]. An ecosystem services framework
can therefore be a beneficial addition to policy-making
institutions and frameworks and to integration of science
and policy.

Conclusions
Natural capital and ecosystem services are key concepts that
are changing the way we view, value, and manage
the natural environment. They are changing the framing
of the issue away from “jobs versus the environment” to a
more balanced assessment of all the assets that contribute
to human well-being and their interrelationships. Signifi-
cant transdisciplinary research has been done in recent
years on ecosystem services, but there is still much more to
do and this will be an active and vibrant research area for
the coming years, because better understanding of
ecosystem services is critical for creating a sustainable and
desirable future. Placing credible values on the full suite of
ecosystem services is key to improving their sustainable
management.
