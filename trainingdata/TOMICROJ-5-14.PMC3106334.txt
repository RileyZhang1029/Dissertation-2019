Abstract:  Culture  independent  methods  are  used  widely  in  diagnostic  laboratories  for  infectious  disease  Isolation  of  
genomic  DNA  from  clinical  samples  is  the  first  and  important  step  in  the  procedure.  Several  procedures  for  extracting 
DNA from faecal samples have been described, including different mechanical cell disruptors. To our knowledge, the use 
of  TissueLyser  as  a  mechanical  disruptor  on  faecal  samples  before  DNA  extraction  has  not  been  previously  described. 
The  purpose  of  the  study  was  to  implement  a  method  for  preparing  faecal  samples  for  optimal  DNA  extraction.  Thus, 
three  different  procedures  for  extracting  DNA  from  human  faeces  were  compared.  This  was  done  either  by  using  the  
mechanical disrupter by Mini BeadBeater 8, or the TissueLyser both followed by DNA purification using QIAamp DNA 
stool  MiniKit,  in  comparison  with  DNA  extractions  using  QIAamp  DNA  stool  MiniKit  without  any  prior  mechanical  
disruption,  according  to  manufacturer’s  instructions.  The  obtained  DNA  from  the  three  procedures  was  analysed  by 
DGGE, and the number of bands was compared between each procedure. There was no significant difference between the 
numbers of bacterial bands obtained  from  DGGE when using  a TissueLyser or Mini BeadBeater 8,  so the  two different 
mechanical  cell  disruptors  can  be  used  comparably  when  isolating  bacterial  DNA  from  faecal  samples.  The  QIAamp 
DNA stool MiniKit alone resulted in a reduced number of bands compared to the two mechanical disruption methods.

INTRODUCTION 

Faecal  samples  contain  a  large  variety  of  bacteria  [1-3]. 
 
Using conventional culture techniques, only a small percent-
age  of  the  bacterial  flora  is  identified  [2,  4-5].  With  the  in-
troduction  and  implementation  of  molecular  techniques  in 
clinical  microbiological  diagnostic  laboratories,  the  identifi-
cation  of  bacteria  present  in  faecal  samples  has  increased 
dramatically  [5-7].  The  isolation  of  genomic  DNA  from 
clinical samples is the first step in studies of microbial diver-
sity  using  cultivation  independent  methods.  It  is,  therefore, 
important  to  obtain  genomic  DNA  that  is  representative  of 
the  microbial  communities present  in  the samples [8]. How-
ever, the use of molecular methods has introduced new prob-
lems,  such  as  obtaining  sufficient  amounts  of  DNA  and  of 
high quality of intact DNA suitable for further processing i.e. 
PCR,  from  faecal  samples  [8-10].  Several  procedures  for 
extracting  DNA  from  faecal  samples  have  been  described, 
including  different  mechanical  cell  disruptors  [2,  11,  12]. 
None of the described methods have been compared system-
atically and in the same study using the same samples.  

 
In  this  study,  three  methods  were  compared  to  evaluate 
the  amount  and  quality  of  bacterial  DNA  extracted  from

human faecal samples. QIAamp DNA stool  MiniKit without 
any  prior  sample  disruption  treatment  was  compared  to  two 
mechanical  disruption  sample  preparations,  i.e.  the  Mini 
BeadBeater 8  and the TissueLyser (Qiagen) used for  animal 
tissue  and  plant  disruption.  Both  homogenisations  were  
followed  by  the  QIAamp  DNA  stool  MiniKit  in  order  to 
compare bacterial DNA extractions.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Human Faecal Samples 

 
Fresh  faecal  samples  were  obtained  from  the  Laboratory 
for  Enteric  Pathogens,  Statens  Serum  Institut,  Copenhagen, 
Denmark,  submitted  for  routine  culture.  The  subjects  were 
between  six  months  and  four  years  of  age,  and  all  had  
diarrhoea;  no  other  clinical  information  was  obtained.  
Each sample was adjusted to 200 mg wet weight stool before 
storage  at  -80ºC  without  glycerol,  until  processing  24  hours 
later. 

Preparation of Samples  

  Each  faecal  sample  was  mixed  with  1.4  ml  ASL  (from 
QIAamp  DNA  stool  MiniKit)  in  a  2  ml  tube  and  vortexed 
until  the  faecal  sample  was  thoroughly  homogenized.  Sam-
ples for  the two mechanical treatments  were mixed with 0.2 
g  sterile  zirconia/silica  beads  (diameter,  0.1  mm,  Biospec 
Product, ROTH, Karlsruhe, Germany).

  The  mechanical  disruption  procedures  were:  the  Mini 
BeadBeater  8  (BioSpec  Products  Inc.,  Bartlesville,  Okla-
homa,  USA)  and  the  TissueLyser  system  (Qiagen  Retsch 
GmbH,  Hannover,  Germany).  Both  procedures  were  
followed  by  DNA  extraction  using  QIAamp  DNA  stool 
MiniKit, (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).  

The Mini BeadBeater 8 

  Bead  mill  homogenization  by  Mini  BeadBeater  8,  with 
high  speed  agitation,  was  performed  on  faecal  samples  as 
described  by  [2].  The  samples  were  homogenized  for  4  min 
at 5000 rpm in a Mini BeadBeater 8. 

TissueLyser 

  Bead  mill  homogenization  with  the  TissueLyser  system 
has  not  been  described  for  faecal  samples  previously,  there-
fore optimising the method was necessary. 

  The TissueLyser  is a vibration apparatus providing high-
throughput  processing  for  effective  disruption  of  biological 
samples  including  bacteria,  animal  soft  tissue  and  plant  tis-
sue  [13].  The  TissueLyser  provides  disruption  and  homog-
enization achieved through the beating and grinding effect of 
the  beads  on  the  sample  material  as  they  shake  together  in 
the  grinding  vessels.  Disruption  for  4  min,  6  min  and  8  min 
at  30  Hz  were  performed  in  an  adapter  set  for  2  x  24  sam-
ples.  To  prevent  variation  in  sample  homogenization,  the 
adaptor  was  removed  from  the  TissueLyser  and  disassem-
bled  in  a  reverse  order  after  the  first  disruption,  to  ensure  a 
uniform sample homogenisation.  

QIAamp  DNA  Stool  MiniKit  (Treated  and  Untreated  
Samples) 

  All  samples  were  centrifuged  for  2  minutes  at  14,000 
rpm  prior  to  the  DNA  extraction.  Extraction  of  DNA  from 
the  supernatant  was  performed  following  the  protocol  of 
QIAamp  DNA  stool  Mini  Kit  (QIAGEN,  Hilden,  Germany) 
as described by the  manufacturer with  the following modifi-
cations:  lysis  temperature,  95ºC  [6].  DNA  was  measured 
spectrophotometrically  (Ultrospec  1100  pro,  Amershan  Bio-
sciences). 

PCR Amplification for DGGE 

  The  V3  region  of  the  16S-rRNA  with  a  length  of  236 
base  pairs  was  amplified  with  universal  bacterial  primers. 
The  forward  primer  PRBA338,  positions  338-357  (E.  coli 
numbering)  (5´ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG)  [14]  and 
reverse  primer  PRUN518,  positions  518-534  (E.  coli  num-
bering)  (5´ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG)  [4,  15].  The  for-
ward  primer  PRBA  338  primers  were  at  the  5´  end  labelled 
with  a  GC  clamp 
(5´CGCCCGCCGCGCGCGGCGG-
GCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGG)  [4].  All  primers  were 
purchased from MWG-BIOTECH AG, Ebersberg, Germany. 
The  final  volume  of  each  PCR  mixture  was  50  (cid:1)l.  The  am-
plification  reaction  mixture  was  as  follows:  1.25  U  of  Taq 
DNA  polymerase  (Promega,  Madison,  Wis),  5  (cid:1)l  10x  PCR 
buffer,  [1.5  mM  MgCl2],  1  (cid:1)l  of  deoxynucleutide  triphos-
phate at a concentration of 10mM, 0.5 (cid:1)M of each primer, 1 
(cid:1)g  of  DNA  template,  0.5  (cid:1)l  BSA  (10  mg/ml).  The  samples 
were  amplified  with  a  Peltier  Thermol  Cycler,  and  the  fol-
lowing  conditions were used: preheating 94ºC for 5  min; 30 

cycles  of  denaturing  94ºC  for  45  sec,  annealing  55ºC  for  30 
sec., elongation 72ºC for 45 sec. 

DGGE of PCR Amplicons 

  The  PCR  fragments  were  separated  by  DGGE  as  de-
scribed  by  Myuzer  [4]  with  the  DCode  System  as  manufac-
turer prescribes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, USA), 8% 
Polyacrylamide  (vol/vol)  (ratio  of  acrylamide:bisacrylamide 
[37.5:1])  in  0.5(cid:2)TAE  buffer;  (pH  8.0)  and  using  a  gradient 
ranging  from  30%  to  65%  denaturant  (100%  denaturant 
acrylamide  corresponds  to  7  M  urea  and  40%  (vol/vol)  for-
mamide).  The  gels  were  cast  using  a  gradient  maker  and  a 
pump with a flow speed of 5  ml per  min. After polymeriza-
tion of the denaturing gel (2 hours), a 3% stacking gel with-
out denaturing chemicals was cast,  and an appropriate  comb 
was  subsequently  inserted  and  left  10  min  for  polymeriza-
tion. Gels were run at 60ºC for 16 h at a constant voltage of 
70  V  in  0.5  (cid:2)  TAE  buffer.  After  electrophoresis,  gels  were 
stained with SYBR-GOLD (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Org, 
USA)  for  20  min,  destained  briefly  in  Milli-Q  water  and 
photographed on the Gel Doc system (Biorad). 

RESULTS 

DNA Amount Extracted from Faecal Samples  

 
Faecal  samples  were  divided  into  equal  portions  and 
treated  by  mechanical  disruptors.  Different  time  lengths  of 
disruption were only tested for the TissueLyser, as  indicated 
in materials and methods.  

  The  highest  amount  of  total  DNA  was  obtained,  when 
using  the  Mini  BeadBeater  8  for  four  minutes  and  the  
TissueLyser  for  eight  minutes  (data  not  shown).  Using  
the  TissueLyser  for  more  than  six  minutes  showed  partial 
degradation of  the genomic DNA on agarose gel. Treatment 
with  TissueLyser  for  4  minutes  did  not  yield  the  same 
amount  of  DNA  compared  to  4  minutes  treatment  with  the 
Mini BeadBeater 8 (data not shown).  

DNA for Further Processing  

  The  quality  of  DNA  was  tested  by  performing  PCR-
DGGE  that  targeted  all  the  bacteria  present  in  the  faecal 
sample.  Similar  results  for  the  two  mechanical  methods  for 
pre-treatment,  i.e.  the  Mini  BeadBeater  for  4  min,  and  Tis-
sueLyser  for  6  and  8  min  were  observed  (Fig.  1).  The 
QIAamp  stool  Minikit  alone  with  no  pre-treatment,  resulted 
in  a  reduced  number  of  bands  on  the  DGGE.  Furthermore, 
the  TissueLyser  treatment  for  4  min  was  not  sufficient  
(Table 1).  

DISCUSSION 

 
Studies of intestinal microflora have conventionally been 
performed by bacterial culturing on selective media [16, 17]. 
Introduction  of  molecular  techniques,  particularly  the  use  of 
PCR- DGGE, has revealed even more complex microbiolog-
ical  communities  to  exist  in  the  intestine  [2,  5,  18].  Several 
studies  have  presented  different  methods  for  DNA  extrac-
tion, such as QIAamp DNA stool MiniKit, Mini Bead Beater 
8 [2], and TissueLyser [13]. However, the described methods 
have not been compared systematically on the same samples 
and  in  the  same  laboratory  setting.  It  is  crucial  in  clinical

microbiology  to  find  a  reproducible  procedure  for  obtaining 
sufficient  amounts  of  DNA,  with  no  degradation  products, 
from even a very small sample.  

  The  results  presented  in  this  study  show  that  a  mechani-
cal  pre-treatment  before  using  the  QIAamp  DNA  stools 
MiniKit facilitates an efficient homogenizing and lysis, lead-
ing to the recovery of an increased amount of bacterial DNA 
(Table 1 and Fig. 1).  

In  this  study,  the  TissueLyser  showed  similar  results  in 
 
disrupting  genomic  DNA  from  faecal  samples  compared  to 
the  Mini  BeadBeater  8.  We  demonstrated  that  the  DGGE 
bands obtained by treatment of 8 min with Mini BeadBeater 
were  similar  to  those  achieved  when  agitating  4  min  and  6 
min,  although  there  was  some  level  of  DNA  degradation  in 
longer treatments (8 min). The two types of mechanical dis-

ruptions are both fast and with the same hands on time. The 
Mini  BeadBeater  8  can  handle  8  samples  simultaneously, 
whereas the Tissuelyser handles 1-52 or 1-96 samples simul-
taneously.  However,  to  prevent  variation  in  sample  homog-
enization, the adaptors have to be disassembled after the first 
disruption and the order reversed. 

  The  study  showed  that  the  TissueLyser  (6  min  process-
ing) is comparable with the Mini BeadBeater 8 (4 min proc-
essing)  with  regard  to  the  quality  and  number  of  the  DGGE 
bands (Table 1). 

 
Furthermore,  the  mechanical  disruption  of  the  faecal 
samples  before  using  the  QIAamp  DNA  stool  MiniKit  im-
proved  the  amount  and  quality  of  DNA  and  thereby  the  di-
versity  in  the  bacterial  bands  in  DGGE.  We  conclude  that 
both  mechanical  devices  can  be  used  with  comparable  re-

sults, favouring the Mini BeadBeater 8 for a small number of 
samples, while the TissueLyser is recommended for process-
ing of a large number of samples.
