Yeasts play an important role in the food and beverage industry, especially in products such
as bread, wine, and beer, among many others. However, their use as a starter in table
olive processing has not yet been studied in detail. The candidate yeast strains should be
able to dominate fermentation, together with lactic acid bacteria, but should also provide
a number of beneﬁcial advantages. Technologically, yeasts should resist low pH and high
salt concentrations, produce desirable aromas, improve lactic acid bacteria growth, and
inhibit spoilage microorganisms. Nowadays, they are being considered as probiotic agents
because many species are able to resist the passage through the gastrointestinal tract
and show favorable effects on the host. In this way, yeasts may improve the health of
consumers by means of the degradation of non-assimilated compounds (such as phytate
complexes), a decrease in cholesterol levels, the production of vitamins and antioxidants,
the inhibition of pathogens, an adhesion to intestinal cell line Caco-2, and the maintenance
of epithelial barrier integrity. Many yeast species, usually found in table olive processing
(Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia membranifaciens, and
Kluyveromyces lactis, among others), have exhibited some of these properties. Thus, the
selection of the most appropriate strains to be used as starters in this fermented vegetable,
alone or in combination with lactic acid bacteria, is a promising research line to develop in
the near future.

INTRODUCTION
Yeasts are unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms with an enor-
mous importance in the food and beverage industry. Sugar
fermentation by yeasts is a well-known and old technology where
carbohydrates are mainly transformed into water, ethanol, CO2,
and other minority compounds. The role played by yeasts in a food
ecosystem is double as they can either be beneﬁcial or spoilage
microorganisms (Querol and Fleet, 2006). In the speciﬁc case of
table olives, where a low pH and high salt concentrations are usu-
ally obtained in the ﬁnal products, they can cause the spoilage
of fruits by the production of bad odors and ﬂavors, accumula-
tion of CO2 leading to swollen containers, clouding of brines or
softening of fruits, which is especially harmful in olive packaging
or storage (for a complete review, see Arroyo-López et al., 2008).
However, these microorganisms also possess desirable activities
with important technological applications in this fermented veg-
etable. Several authors have studied, among others, the lipolytic
(lipase and esterase), β-glucosidase, catalase, and killer activities
of different yeast species related to table olives or oleic ecosystems
for their potential use as starters (Marquina et al., 1992; Psani and
Kotzekidou, 2006; Hernández et al., 2007; Bevilacqua et al., 2009;
Aponte et al., 2010; Rodríguez-Gómez et al., 2010, 2012; Romo-
Sánchez et al., 2010; Bautista-Gallego et al., 2011). Recently, the
probiotic potential of table olive related yeasts has begun to be

evaluated (Psani and Kotzekidou, 2006; Silva et al., 2011), which
clearly improves the commercial value of the product.

The present mini-review deals with the favorable use of yeasts
in table olive processing, focusing on their technological and pro-
biotic applications, especially in those elaborations where their
presence is more abundant such as in directly brined green and
natural black olives. As olives are not lye treated in these prepa-
rations,
lactic acid bacteria are partially inhibited due to the
presence of phenolic compounds, so the role played by yeasts
is more important (Ruiz-Barba et al., 1993; Garrido-Fernández
et al., 1997).

USE OF YEAST STARTERS WITH TECHNOLOGICAL
APPLICATIONS IN TABLE OLIVE PROCESSING
The application of yeasts in table olives could technologically
improve the process in different ways:
(i) Yeasts produce compounds such as ethanol, glycerol, higher
alcohols, esters, and other volatile compounds which may play
an important role in ﬂavor generation and texture maintenance
during table olive processing (Garrido et al., 1995). In this way,
Sánchez et al. (2000) and Montaño et al. (2003) reported the
formation of acetic acid, succinic acid, formic acid, ethanol,
and acetaldehyde, all of them usually produced by yeasts, dur-
ing green olive fermentations. The esterase and lipase activities

Yeast starters in table olives

exhibited by diverse yeast species could also improve the aro-
matic proﬁle of fermented olives by increasing their free fatty
acid content (Hernández et al., 2007; Rodríguez-Gómez et al.,
2010, 2012). In fact, Candida boidinii has been related to a
modiﬁcation of the characteristics of the olive fat during ripe
olive processing (Rodríguez-Gómez et al., 2010).

(ii) Biodegradation of polyphenols by yeasts (β-glucosidase activ-
ity) is another interesting technological aspect. Olives contain
high levels of oleuropein, which is responsible for their bitter
taste, so they must be treated with a NaOH solution to make
them edible. The presence of yeasts able to biologically degrade
phenols could reduce the large quantities of olive wastewater
produced during the lye treatment for fruit debittering, leading
to a more natural product at the same time.

(iii) Yeasts could also be used as biocontrol agents (Viljoen, 2006).
They produce toxic proteins or glycoproteins, also called
killer factors, able to inhibit the growth of fungi and other
non-desirable yeast species. Wickerhamomyces anomalus (pre-
viously called Pichia anomala) and Pichia membranifaciens are
species with promising perspectives in this aspect because of
their proved inhibitory activity against a considerable num-
ber of microorganisms (Santos et al., 2000; Passoth et al.,
2011). Therefore, they may reduce the requirements for salt
and preservatives necessary to ensure packaging stability and
produce healthier products.

(iv) It has been proven that yeasts could improve lactic acid bacteria
growth and as well as the production of lactic acid (Tsapat-
saris and Kotzekidou, 2004; Segovia Bravo et al., 2007). Yeasts
appear to be active microorganisms synthesizing substances
such as vitamins, amino acids and purines, or breakdown
complex carbohydrates, which is essential for the growth
of Lactobacillus species that need a more complex medium
for optimal growth (Ruiz-Barba and Jiménez-Díaz, 1995;
Viljoen, 2006).

(v) Catalase positive yeast strains are also favorable because they
contribute to preserving olives against unsaturated fatty acid
oxidation and peroxide formation (Hernández et al., 2007).
Fortunately, this is a widespread property in table olive related
yeasts, and species such as W. anomalus, Pichia galeiformis,
and Kluyveromyces lactis have proven to have this activity
(Hernández et al., 2007; Bautista-Gallego et al., 2011).

Therefore, the selection of the most appropriate yeasts to be
used as starters must be based on those strains which present
the best global activities for the above mentioned characteristics,
but they must also be able to predominate during fermenta-
tion. They have to present a high resistance to salt and low
pH values. Predictive microbiology is a valuable tool for the
discrimination and selection of the most promising strains,
determining the inﬂuence of environmental variables on yeast
growth (Arroyo-López et al., 2010). Another additional problem
is the application of an appropriate methodology for the man-
agement of such a large amount of data, which is necessary
when researchers have to analyze several biochemical activi-
ties or growth data (variables) from a considerable number of
strains (cases). Multivariate analysis techniques offer a viable
approach to solving this setback. Bevilacqua et al. (2009) used

a multivariate analysis approach to jointly study growth and
qualitative activity data of a number of yeasts isolated from
Bella di Cerignola table olives. The use of a principal com-
ponent analysis was also a valuable tool for the selection and
discrimination of several W. anomalus and C. boidinii isolates
with the highest global desirable activity levels, clearly differen-
tiated from the rest of assayed yeast species (Rodríguez-Gómez
et al., 2012).

USE OF YEAST STARTERS WITH PROBIOTIC
CHARACTERISTICS IN TABLE OLIVE PROCESSING
Probiotics are microorganisms that, after delivery to the gastro-
intestinal tract, exert beneﬁcial effects to the host (FAO/WHO,
2001). They should also be safe for the host and metaboli-
cally active within the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics may be
consumed either as food components or as non-food preparations.
Table olives are currently being studied as a food carrier
whereby probiotic microorganisms could enter the human body.
These studies have been mainly focused hitherto exclusively on lac-
tic acid bacteria (Lavermicocca et al., 2005; De Bellis et al., 2010).
However, yeasts are interesting microorganisms that may improve
human health (Moslehi-Jenabian et al., 2010). Only Psani and
Kotzekidou (2006) and Silva et al. (2011) have recently started
to assess the probiotic characteristics of table olive related yeasts.
The former authors found diverse Torulaspora delbrueckii and
Debaryomyces hansenii strains which tolerated high bile salt con-
centrations and low pH values. Culture ﬁltrates of these strains
inhibited food borne pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes,
Bacillus cereus, and Salmonella typhimurium. The later authors
also found diverse P. membranifaciens and Candida oleophila
strains with similar properties but with a different spectrum of
inhibition (in this case for Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteri-
tidis, and Staphylococcus aureus). Different yeast species, many
of them usually found in table olive processing, such as D.
hansenii, T. delbrueckii, K. lactis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
have shown tolerance to passage through the gastrointestinal
tract, inhibition of enteropathogens, adhesion to intestinal Caco-
2 line cell, and immunostimulatory activity (Pennacchia et al.,
2008; Kourelis et al., 2010; Moslehi-Jenabian et al., 2010; Etienne-
Mesmin et al., 2011). However, Saccharomyces boulardii is so far
the only yeast with clinical effects and the only yeast preparation
with proven probiotic efﬁciency in double-blind clinical studies
(Sazawal et al., 2006).

But there are other beneﬁcial effects for human health that
justify the application of yeasts in table olive processing. For
example, diverse strains of K. lactis, S. cerevisiae, and Issatchenkia
orientalis exhibit great ability to reduce cholesterol serum levels
(Kourelis et al., 2010). Phytate has a strong chelating capac-
ity and forms insoluble complexes with divalent minerals of
nutritional importance such as zinc, calcium, magnesium, and
iron. Humans lack the required enzymes in the gastrointesti-
nal tract for the degradation of phytate complexes. Dephos-
phorylation of phytate is catalyzed by phytases, which are
widespread in yeast species such as I. orientalis, W. anoma-
lus, S. cerevisiae, T. delbrueckii, and K. lactis (Olstorpe et al.,
2009; Moslehi-Jenabian et al., 2010). Folates (vitamin B9) are
essential cofactors in the biosynthesis of nucleotides and therefore

crucial for cellular replication and growth. Yeasts contain the folate
biosynthesis pathway and produce natural folates, but mammals
lack the ability to synthesize them and are therefore dependent on
their intake from the diet. S. cerevisiae and Candida glabrata are
species with high folate synthesis (Moslehi-Jenabian et al., 2010).
Diverse yeast strains isolated from table olives and belonging
to the P. membranifaciens and Pichia farinosa species have also
shown the capacity to produce B-complex vitamins (Ruiz-Barba
and Jiménez-Díaz, 1995; Silva et al., 2011). Yeasts can also synthe-
size a number of bioactive compounds which can serve as natural
antioxidants. The screening of yeasts for free-radical-scavenging
activity is an active area of research (Gazi et al., 2001). These
authors reported that W. anomalus produced the highest activity
in a laboratory medium. The production of bioactive antioxi-
dants may retard the oxidative degeneration of fatty substances
and improve human health.

In any case, an essential requirement for probiotic yeasts is that
they must be able to adhere to the olive epidermis, and thus, be
ingested by consumers. Figure 1 clearly shows that certain yeast
species, in this speciﬁc case C. boidinii, have the capacity of adhe-
sion and colonization of olive skin, by means of the formation
of complex exopolysaccharide matrixes which embed into the
microorganisms, and very likely, improve their viability during
the passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Personal data show
that in many cases these bioﬁlms are formed by mixed popula-
tions of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. However, the molecular
basis of this adhesion and interaction between microorganisms is
still unclear.

CONCLUSION
Harnessing and exploiting the technological and probiotic prop-
erties of yeasts in table olive processing require fundamental
knowledge on their physiology, ecology, biochemistry, and genet-
ics. Inoculated yeast strains should be molecularly monitored
throughout fermentation (in both cover brines and olive surface)
to conﬁrm their imposition and presence in the ﬁnal product, espe-
cially relevant in the case of probiotic microorganisms. This con-
sciousness will provide the grounds for improving the strategies

performed on this fermented vegetable and increase its competi-
tiveness. Undoubtedly, the full potential of table olive related yeasts
has not been fully determined and many challenges are awaiting
research, dissemination, and exploitation.
