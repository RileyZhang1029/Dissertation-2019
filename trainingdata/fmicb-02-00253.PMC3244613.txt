Sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP) are ubiquitous and quantitatively important members
in many ecosystems, especially in marine sediments. However their abundance and diver-
sity in subsurface marine sediments is poorly understood. In this study, the abundance and
diversity of the functional genes for the enzymes adenosine 5(cid:2)-phosphosulfate reductase
(aprA) and dissimilatory sulﬁte reductase (dsrA) of SRP in marine sediments of the Peru
continental margin and the Black Sea were analyzed, including samples from the deep
biosphere (ODP site 1227). For aprA quantiﬁcation a Q-PCR assay was designed and eval-
uated. Depth proﬁles of the aprA and dsrA copy numbers were almost equal for all sites.
Gene copy numbers decreased concomitantly with depth from around 108/g sediment
close to the sediment surface to less than 105/g sediment at 5 mbsf. The 16S rRNA gene
copy numbers of total bacteria were much higher than those of the functional genes at
all sediment depths and used to calculate the proportion of SRP to the total Bacteria. The
aprA and dsrA copy numbers comprised in average 0.5–1% of the 16S rRNA gene copy
numbers of total bacteria in the sediments up to a depth of ca. 40 mbsf. In the zone without
detectable sulfate in the pore water from about 40–121 mbsf (Peru margin ODP site 1227),
only dsrA (but not aprA) was detected with copy numbers of less than 104/g sediment,
comprising ca. 14% of the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of total bacteria. In this zone,
sulfate might be provided for SRP by anaerobic sulﬁde oxidation. Clone libraries of aprA
showed that all isolated sequences originate from SRP showing a close relationship to
aprA of characterized species or form a new cluster with only distant relation to aprA of
isolated SRP. For dsrA a high diversity was detected, even up to 121 m sediment depth in
the deep biosphere.

INTRODUCTION
Sulfate reduction plays a crucial role in the past and present global
sulfur cycle, and may be regarded as one of the oldest meta-
bolic pathways on Earth (Castresana and Moreira, 1999; Schen
et al., 2001). Therefore, sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP) are
biogeochemically important organisms in the environment, espe-
cially for the degradation of organic matter in coastal but also in
deeply buried marine sediments in the open ocean (Jørgensen,
1982; Ferdelman et al., 1997; Knoblauch et al., 1999; Sahm et al.,
1999; Thamdrup et al., 2000; Jørgensen et al., 2001; D’Hondt
et al., 2004; Parkes et al., 2005; Schippers et al., 2005, 2010).
Despite their importance in subsurface marine sediments the
abundance and diversity of SRP in this environment is poorly
understood. Global surveys of SRP cell numbers and gene sequenc-
ing data are missing and thus, more primary data for particu-
lar sediment sites are necessary. This includes the development
of new methods for the detection of SRP in environmental
samples.

The abundance of SRP in marine sediments has been deter-
mined by a variety of methods including MPN-cultivation
(Knoblauch et al., 1999), 16S rRNA slot-blot hybridization (Sahm
et al., 1999), or FISH and CARD-FISH with 16S rRNA gene probes
(Ravenschlag et al., 2000; Gittel et al., 2008). Since SRP are phyloge-
netically diverse (Stahl et al., 2002), 16S rRNA approaches require
a comprehensive set of 16S rRNA probes for a full, quantitative
coverage of all SRP in an environmental sample (Ravenschlag
et al., 2000). The functional gene encoding for dissimilatory sulﬁte
reductase (dsrA) of SRP shows a high similarity in different SRP
(Wagner et al., 1998), thus a dsrA speciﬁc PCR primer set targeting
both, Gram-positive and Gram-negative SRP species, was devel-
oped for competitive PCR quantiﬁcation (Kondo et al., 2004).
These primers were also used to design a quantitative, real-time
PCR (Q-PCR) assay for dsrA for SRP quantiﬁcation in subsur-
face marine sediments (Schippers and Neretin, 2006; Leloup et al.,
2007, 2009; Nunoura et al., 2009; Webster et al., 2009; Schippers
et al., 2010) and the Black Sea water column (Neretin et al., 2007).

Functional genes aprA and dsrA

Other Q-PCR assays for dsrA based on other primers (Wagner
et al., 1998; Dhillon et al., 2003; Geets et al., 2006) were also applied
to marine sediments (Wilms et al., 2007; Engelen et al., 2008), oil
(Agrawal and Lal, 2009), and wastewater (Ben-Dov et al., 2007).
Furthermore, RT-Q-PCR was applied to quantify mRNA of dsrA
(Neretin et al., 2003).

Due to PCR bias or mismatches of the dsrA of not yet discov-
ered SRP with the available dsrA primers, important SRP might
have been overlooked in environmental samples. This might have
happened in studies of deeply buried marine sediments (e.g., Peru
continental margin, ODP Leg 201) in which sulfate reduction was
identiﬁed as an important biogeochemical process, but dsrA or 16S
rRNA genes of SRP were scarcely detected (D’Hondt et al., 2004;
Parkes et al., 2005; Schippers et al., 2005; Inagaki et al., 2006; Schip-
pers and Neretin, 2006; Teske, 2006; Webster et al., 2006, 2009; Fry
et al., 2008; Nunoura et al., 2009). For this reason, another indepen-
dent SRP quantiﬁcation method is useful to reveal dsrA data and
to conﬁrm the full quantitative coverage of SRP in environmental
sample analyses, especially for the deep biosphere.
(cid:2)
A second functional gene of SRP is the adenosine 5

-
phosphosulfate reductase gene aprA. In sulfate reducers, APS
reductase catalyzes the two-electron reduction of APS to sulﬁte
and AMP. APS reductase consists of an alpha and beta subunit,
encoded by the genes aprA and aprB, respectively. The aprA gene
has been thoroughly studied in SRP, and speciﬁc PCR and Q-PCR
ampliﬁcation of aprA was shown (Friedrich, 2002; Blazejak et al.,
2005; Ben-Dov et al., 2007; Meyer and Kuever, 2007).

The objective of this study was a better understanding of the
abundance and diversity of SRP in subsurface marine sediments.
A Q-PCR assay speciﬁc for aprA of SRP was designed and applied
to samples from different marine sediments together with the
published Q-PCR assay for dsrA quantiﬁcation (Schippers and
Neretin, 2006). The diversity of SRP was analyzed based on cloning
and sequencing of their functional genes aprA and dsrA. Marine
sediments of the Peru continental margin, including samples from
the deep biosphere (ODP site 1227), and the Black Sea were cho-
sen because previous studies indicate that sulfate reduction is an
important biogeochemical process in these sediments (Jørgensen
et al., 2001; D’Hondt et al., 2004; Schippers et al., 2005). In addi-
tion, the abundance of sulfate reducers and other microorganisms
was already determined using different assays, allowing compar-
isons with our newly developed method (Schippers et al., 2005;
Inagaki et al., 2006; Schippers and Neretin, 2006; Leloup et al.,
2007; Blazejak and Schippers, 2010).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE COLLECTION
Samples were collected from different sediment depths at three
marine sites during three research vessel expeditions. Site 1227
(8˚59.5
W) at a water depth of 427 m on the Peru margin
was sampled with advanced piston coring up to 121 mbsf during
Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 201 in March 2002 (D’Hondt
et al., 2003; Jørgensen et al., 2005). Site 2MC (11˚35.0
W)
at a water depth of 86 m on the Peru continental margin was sam-
pled with a multicorer up to 0.34 mbsf during the cruise SO147
of R/V Sonne in June 2000. Site 20 (43˚57.25
E) at a
water depth of 2048 m in the Black Sea was sampled with a gravity

corer up to 5.8 mbsf during cruise M72-5 of R/V Meteor in May
2007.
Samples for molecular analysis were taken aseptically from the
center of the cores at all stations and were stored at −20˚C until
further processing in the laboratory. For the recovery of deeply
buried sediments from site 1227 on the Peru margin seawater
based drilling ﬂuid was used. Thus a potential contamination with
seawater microorganisms was routinely checked by application of
ﬂuorescent beads of prokaryotic cell size and a chemical tracer
(D’Hondt et al., 2003). Only uncontaminated samples were used
for further analysis.

DNA EXTRACTION
DNA was isolated from 0.5–4 g sediment of various depths using
a FastDNA®Spin for Soil Kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA)
with the following modiﬁcation: to increase the yield of isolated
DNA from clayish sediments 200 μg polyadenylic acid (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) dissolved in sterile
water was added to the sample at the ﬁrst step of the extraction
procedure (Webster et al., 2003). DNA extracts from blank tubes
(no sediment added) were used as procedural contamination con-
trol in later PCR analyses. Isolated DNA was stored in aliquots to
avoid multiple defrosting and freezing and was thawed for Q-PCR
measurements not more than twice.

Q-PCR MEASUREMENTS
Quantitative PCR measurements were run in triplicate on an ABI
Prism 7000 detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA). Quantiﬁcation of Bacteria in total was performed
using a Q-PCR assay based on the detection of the 16S rRNA
gene (Nadkarni et al., 2002). The dissimilatory sulﬁte reduc-
tase gene dsrA of SRP was quantiﬁed using a published protocol
(Schippers and Neretin, 2006) and primers (Kondo et al., 2004).
The size of the ampliﬁed fragments was 219 bp. To quantify
(cid:2)
the adenosine 5
-phosphosulfate reductase gene aprA of SRP, a
novel Q-PCR assay was designed. For speciﬁc ampliﬁcation of
this gene the primers APS1F (5-TGGCAGATCATGATYMAYGG-
3) and APS4R (5-GCGCCAACYGGRCCRTA-3) were used (Blaze-
jak et al., 2005; Meyer and Kuever, 2007). The size of the
ampliﬁed fragments was 384–396 bp. The Q-PCR assay was per-
formed with Platinum® SYBR® Green Q-PCR SuperMix-UDG
with ROX (Invitrogen, Carlsberg, CA, USA), a primer concen-
tration of 300 nM, and the following ampliﬁcation conditions:
95˚C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95˚C for 15 s and 60˚C for
1 min. Two microliters sample DNA were added to a PCR reac-
tion assay with a total volume of 25 μL. Melting curve analyses
were run after each assay to check PCR speciﬁcity. For ampliﬁca-
tion of standards, DNA was extracted, ampliﬁed, and puriﬁed from
minipreps of cloned aprA gene sequences from sulfate-reducing
endosymbiotic bacteria with the accession numbers AM234052
and AM234053.

Q-PCR DATA ANALYSIS
Relative standards were prepared by serial dilution (1:10) of the
PCR product. For each standard, the concentration was plot-
ted against the cycle number at which the ﬂuorescence signal
increased above the background or cycle threshold (C t value). The

slope of each calibration curve was included into the following
equation to determine the efﬁciency of the PCR reaction: efﬁ-
ciency= 10(−1/slope) − 1. According to this formula, an efﬁciency
of 100% means a doubling of the product in each cycle. Data eval-
uation was performed with the software StepOne™ v2.0 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

PCR AMPLIFICATION, CLONING, AND SEQUENCING OF THE dsrA AND
aprA GENES
DNA was isolated from sediment samples of the Peru margin from
three depths, 3.6, 65.3, and 121.4 mbsf (site 1227, ODP Leg 201)
and in the Black Sea from four depths, 0.15, 2.7, 4.5, and 5.8 mbsf
(site 20 GC, M72-5). Except for the number of cycles, ampliﬁcation
of the dsrA and aprA genes was carried out at the same conditions
as for the Q-PCR assays (see above). For ampliﬁcation of the dsrA
gene, 30 cycles of PCR were required for the sediment sample from
3.6 mbsf depth of the Peru margin, and 35 cycles for the other sam-
ples. To amplify the aprA gene, 25 cycles of PCR were applied to
the sediment samples from 0.15 and 2.7 mbsf depth in the Black
Sea, and up to 35 cycles for the remaining samples. Three parallel
PCR products obtained from each depth were combined, puriﬁed
using a QIAquick PCR puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany),
and subsequently cloned using the pGEM®-T Easy vector system
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and TOP10 chemically competent
cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol. Because of the high number of PCR cycles also
the yield of the negative controls, although no visible ampliﬁca-
tion was observed, was puriﬁed, and cloned. Clones were randomly
picked, suspended in PCR grade water and selected for the correct
insert size by PCR with vector primers. Approximately 50 positive
clones per depth were sequenced with the vector primer M13 For-
ward. Sequencing reactions were run using ABI BigDye on an ABI
Prism 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA).

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
For sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree reconstruction
sequences were analyzed with the BioEdit program1 and the soft-
ware ARB2. Brieﬂy, after removal of the vector sequence, sequences
were aligned and clustered. Phylogenetic calculations for the par-
tial aprA genes were generated from 128–132 deduced amino acids
sequences using maximum-likelihood analyses with a 25% posi-
tional conservation ﬁlter. For the phylogenetic analysis of the par-
tial dsrA sequences ﬁrst a maximum-likelihood tree was generated
from dsrAB sequences of full length (approximately 650 amino
acids), than successively single partial dsrA sequences (73 amino
acids) were added to the tree using a 25% positional conservation
ﬁlter.

NUCLEOTIDE ACCESSION NUMBERS
The dsrA and aprA gene sequences obtained in this study were sub-
mitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank nucleotide databases under
the accession numbers HE575209–HE575212 and HE575674–
HE575681 for aprA sequences and HE575682–HE575732 for dsrA
sequences.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this study the abundance and diversity of the functional genes
for adenosine 5
-phosphosulfate reductase (aprA) and dissimi-
latory sulﬁte reductase (dsrA) of SRP were analyzed in marine
sediments from the Black Sea, and the Peru continental margin,
including deep biosphere sediments (ODP site 1227). For aprA
quantiﬁcation a Q-PCR assay was designed. The evaluation results
for this assay are followed by data on the abundance and diversity
of aprA and dsrA in sediments. For comparison and interpretation,
16S rRNA gene copy numbers of total bacteria from a previous
study (Blazejak and Schippers, 2010) have been included here.

EVALUATION OF THE Q-PCR ASSAY FOR aprA
Ampliﬁcation quantities of the standard ranged from 1.0× 101 to
1.0× 107 molecules with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.996. The
efﬁciency of the PCR reactions was 96%. Detection of conta-
minant DNA in the negative control was not observed. In our
experiments the detection limit was set to 1.0× 102 molecules.
This could be lowered to 1.0× 101 still ensuring reliable detec-
tion values since no contaminant DNA in the negative controls
was identiﬁed. Detection limits for gene quantiﬁcation by PCR for
functional genes can range up to 10 copies per reaction (Vaerman
et al., 2004; Bustin et al., 2009). However one critical limitation
of PCR-based methods is their sensitivity to compounds that are
co-extracted with the DNA from environmental samples, in par-
ticular from sediments and soils, that may inﬂuence and inhibit the
real-time PCR-process. For example humic acids can hamper the
PCR reaction and impair ﬂuorescence, and metal ions can inhibit
DNA polymerases (Lindberg et al., 2007) whereby the detection
limit is lowered. The maximum ﬂuorescence signal of the melting
curve occurred at a temperature of 87˚C. Melting curves were ana-
lyzed after each assay and always showed a single peak, verifying
the speciﬁcity of the PCR ampliﬁcation.

QUANTIFICATION OF THE FUNCTIONAL GENES aprA AND dsrA OF SRP
AND 16S rRNA OF TOTAL BACTERIA IN MARINE SEDIMENT SAMPLES
Depth proﬁles of DNA copy numbers of the functional genes
aprA and dsrA as marker for sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP)
and the 16S rRNA gene of total Bacteria are shown in Figure 1
for three sediment sites, surface (site 2MC, 0–0.35 mbsf) and
deep (site 1227, 0–121.4 mbsf) sediments on the Peru margin,
and in the Black Sea (site 20, 0–5.8 mbsf). The copy numbers of
all genes decreased with sediment depth in different depth gra-
dients. An important ﬁnding of this study was that the depth
proﬁles of copy numbers of both functional genes, aprA and
dsrA, were almost equal for all sediment sites expect for the ODP
site 1227 below 40 mbsf. Congruent SRP quantiﬁcation proﬁles
based on independent Q-PCR analysis of two functional genes
imply that no SRP have been overlooked, and that the results are
close to the actual SRP gene density in the subsurface. Two inde-
pendent Q-PCR assays with different primers are very unlikely
to generate identical PCR biases and quantiﬁcation proﬁles by
chance.

In the Black Sea at site 20, all gene copy numbers decreased
rapidly within 65 cm from the sediment surface. The dsrA and aprA
copy numbers decreased from 107–108 copies/g at the sediment
surface to less than 105 copies/g below 0.6 mbsf. They decreased

further to less than 104 copies/g below 3 mbsf. The dsrA copy
numbers close to the sediment surface were similar to those for
another sediment site of the Black Sea (Leloup et al., 2007). Down-
core, the numbers in our study decreased toward lower counts than
those in the previous study. Similar differences between these two
sites were also found for the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of total
Bacteria. While site 20 was located in the central basin of the Black
Sea southeast of the peninsula Crimea at 2048 m water depth, the
site of the previous study was located west of the peninsula Crimea
on the slope at 1024 m water depth. Thus, different organic matter
availability may explain the different gene copy numbers in the
two studies.

In the Peru continental margin near-surface sediments (site
2MC) the dsrA and aprA copy numbers were very close to each
other and exhibited a more pronounced depth gradient than the
16S rRNA gene copy numbers of total Bacteria (Figure 1). The dsrA
and aprA copy numbers decreased from more than 108 copies/g
at the sediment surface to 106–107 copies/g between 0.18 and

surface (site 2MC, 0–0.35 mbsf) and deep (site 1227, 0–121.4 mbsf)
sediments on the Peru margin, and in the Black Sea (site 20, 0–5.8
mbsf), and depth proﬁle of pore water sulfate concentrations at site

0.34 mbsf. In a previous Q-PCR study of the same site (Schippers
and Neretin, 2006), the dsrA and 16S rRNA gene copy numbers
of total Bacteria copy numbers were similar to those of this new
study.

In the deeply buried Peru margin sediment (site 1227) the dsrA
and aprA copy numbers decreased from 105–106/g sediment at
the top of the core at 0.6 mbsf to less than 104/g sediment at
10 mbsf. These numbers for both genes stay steady up to 35 mbsf.
Below 35 mbsf the run of the curves are different. After a slight
increase of the aprA gene copy numbers between 37–40 mbsf they
drop to less than 103/g sediment at 42 mbsf and are not more
detectable underneath this depth. In contrast, dsrA copy numbers
below 104 copies/g sediment are still observed up to the depth of
121 mbsf. For all samples between 10–121 mbsf, dsrA copy num-
bers remained consistent in this range. In contrast, dsrA was only
patchily detected (5 out of 19 samples) in the previous study
(Schippers and Neretin, 2006). The dsrA values in the deeper sedi-
ment are close to the detection limit of the Q-PCR method. Thus,
slight differences in the efﬁciency of DNA extraction from the sed-
iment or differences in the total amount of sediment used for DNA
extraction may explain this discrepancy.

The 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of total Bacteria exceeded
those of the functional genes at all sediment depths, and allowed
to calculate the proportion of SRP to total Bacteria. The aprA and
dsrA copy numbers comprised in average 0.5–1% of the 16S rRNA
gene copy numbers of total Bacteria in the sediments of the Black
Sea and those from the Peru continental margin up to a depth of
ca. 40 mbsf. Below, only dsrA (but not aprA) was detected with
copy numbers of less than 104/g sediment, comprising ca. 14%
of the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of total Bacteria. In other
marine sediments sulfate reducers contributed to <1–30% to the
prokaryotic community based on Q-PCR, FISH, or rRNA slot
blot hybridization analyses (Sahm et al., 1999; Ravenschlag et al.,
2000; Knittel et al., 2003; Schippers and Neretin, 2006; Leloup
et al., 2007, 2009; Wilms et al., 2007; Gittel et al., 2008; Julies
et al., 2010; Schippers et al., 2010). Overall our Q-PCR analy-
sis of the functional genes revealed that SRP are a minor part
of the prokaryotic community in the Peru margin sediments, in
agreement with clone library data (Parkes et al., 2005; Inagaki
et al., 2006; Webster et al., 2006). Based on Q-PCR analysis of
the same sediment samples especially the bacterial groups Chlo-
roﬂexi and/or candidate division JS-1 were shown to be dominant
(Blazejak and Schippers, 2010), while Archaea, Eukarya, and the
Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-reducing bacteria of the family Geobacter-
aceae (Inagaki et al., 2006; Schippers and Neretin, 2006) were of
minor abundance.

Active sulfate reduction for the two Peru margin sites up to
a depth of ca. 40 mbsf was conﬁrmed by pore water sulfate pro-
ﬁles and sulfate reduction rate measurements (Böning et al., 2004;
D’Hondt et al., 2004; Schippers et al., 2005). At ca. 40 mbsf sulfate is
reduced by methane oxidation (sulfate–methane transition zone)
and a slight maximum of 16S rRNA genes was detected (Schip-
pers et al., 2005; Schippers and Neretin, 2006; Sørensen and Teske,
2006; Teske and Sørensen, 2008). This maximum is not reﬂected by
higher copy numbers of the functional genes dsrA or aprA of SRP
indicating that sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation is
not linked to a SRP population peak.

Functional genes aprA and dsrA

The detection of dsrA of SRP below ca. 40 mbsf was sur-
prising because sulfate as the electron acceptor for active SRP
was not detectable in the pore water from ca. 40–121 mbsf of
site 1227 (Figure 1). There are three possibilities to explain this
ﬁnding: 1. The detected dsrA was not extracted from living cells
but is part of fossil DNA, persisting adsorbed to sediment parti-
cles over geological time scales as previously discussed (Inagaki
et al., 2005; Schippers and Neretin, 2006; Schippers et al., 2010);
2. The dsrA originated from living SRP which use another elec-
tron acceptor than sulfate, e.g., Fe(III) as shown for several genera
of SRP (Vandieken et al., 2006); 3. Low amounts of sulfate might
be provided by anoxic oxidation of sulﬁdes. The sulfate formed
by this process is constantly consumed by SRP, thus it remained
undetectable in the pore water.

We believe that the third possibility is most relevant. On the
one hand very low rates of sulfate reduction have been measured
with sulfate radiotracer for site 1227 even below 40 mbsf (Schip-
pers et al., 2005). On the other hand, stable isotope data of oxygen
and sulfate for sediment and experimental studies support a deep
anoxic sulfur cycle. Sulﬁde oxidation occurs with reactive iron or
manganese oxides as oxidant in deeply buried sediments (Bottrell
et al., 2000, 2008; Schippers and Jørgensen, 2001; Riedinger et al.,
2010; Holmkvist et al., 2011a,b).

DIVERSITY OF THE FUNCTIONAL GENES aprA AND dsrA IN SEDIMENT
SAMPLES
To analyze not only the abundance but also the diversity of SRP,
their metabolic key genes, aprA and dsrA genes, were cloned. Sed-
iment samples of three depths at the Peru margin (site 1227), 3.6,
65.3, and 121.4 mbsf, and four depths in the Black Sea (site 20),
0.15, 2.7, 4.5, and 5.8 mbsf were selected for the study. Sequence
analysis of the isolated aprA and dsrA sequences showed their rela-
tionship to aprA or dsrA genes from characterized SRP indicating
that they also originate from SRP. Although high numbers of PCR
cycles were required (up to 35 cycles for dsrA ampliﬁcation), no vis-
ible ampliﬁcation was observed in the negative controls. Sequences

of a few clones obtained from the negative controls showed that
only primer sequences were inserted into the cloning vectors. Thus,
despite the high PCR cycle number no contamination was noted.
For aprA analysis, 50 clones from a Peru margin sediment at
3.6 mbsf, and 24–45 clones from each Black Sea sediment depth
were sequenced. Sequences were grouped into distinct clone fami-
lies based on their sequence similarities and their allocation within
the phylogenetic tree after algorithmic calculations. Sequence sim-
ilarities within a clone family as well as the similarity to the next
relative sequence of a cultivated bacterium are shown in Table 1.
For phylogenetic tree reconstruction all sequences were used; how-
ever only one representative sequence of each clone family is
presented (Figure 2).

The aprA sequences isolated from 3.6 mbsf depth on the Peru
margin were classiﬁed into four distinct clone families showing a
close relationship to the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) Desulfo-
coccus multivorans, Desulfomonile tiedjei, Desulfovibrio baarsii, and
a cluster including the genera Desulfacinum, Desulforhabdus, and
Syntrophobacter (Figure 2; Table 1). In deeper sediment layers, at
65.3 and 121.4 mbsf, the aprA gene was not ampliﬁed although a
high number of cycles (up to 35) was applied. This result corre-
sponds to the absence of quantitative data of the aprA using the
newly designed Q-PCR assay (Figure 1).

In the Black Sea sediment a slight decline of diversity with
depth could be observed. Near-surface (0.15 mbsf) aprA sequences
were assigned into four distinct clone families: D. multivorans, D.
tiedjei, Desulfobacterium anilini, and a cluster including the gen-
era Desulfacinum, Desulforhabdus, and Syntrophobacter. In con-
trast, sequences from 2.7 and 5.8 mbsf formed only two clone
groups each, related to Desulfonema magnum and Desulfobulbus
elongatus, and Desulfomonile tiedjei and Desulfobacterium anilini,
respectively (Figure 2; Table 1).

Almost all isolated aprA sequences showed a close relation-
ship to aprA sequences of cultivated, well characterized SRB of
the Deltaproteobacteria indicating that they also originate from
bacteria with a same metabolism. For two sequences (accession

numbers HE575680 and HE575212), their relationship to known
organisms is difﬁcult to predict because they form a separate
branch and are only distantly related to aprA sequences of charac-
terized SRB of the Deltaproteobacteria and Gram-positive SRB of
the genus Desulfotomaculum (Figure 2; Table 1).

The dsrA sequences could be ampliﬁed from sediment sam-
ples of all analyzed depths from the Peru margin and the Black Sea
(Table 2). Up to 51 clone sequences per depth were included in the
phylogenetic analysis. Because of the high PCR cycle number of
up to 35 cycles, the negative controls was also cloned although no
PCR bands were observed. Sequences obtained from these negative
controls showed that only primer sequences were inserted into the
cloning vector, thus despite the high PCR cycle number no conta-
mination was found. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all isolated
dsrA sequences were closely related to the metabolic gene dsrA. The
dsrA sequences isolated from the Peru margin and the Black Sea
sediments were classiﬁed into eight clone families, showing overall
a higher diversity than the isolated aprA sequences. Sequence sim-
ilarities within a clone family as well as the similarity to the next
relative sequence of cultivated prokaryote are shown in Table 2. For

phylogenetic tree reconstruction all sequences were used however
only one representative sequence of each clone family is presented
in Figure 3. Except for three clone families, sequences belonging to
all other groups are closely related to dsrA sequences isolated from
SRP of Deltaproteobacteria showing for some sequences habitat
speciﬁcity. For example: dsrA sequences related to Desulfovibrio
acrylicus, Desulfohalobium utahense, and to the genera Desulfob-
ulbus, Desulfacinum, and Syntrophobacter were only found in
sediments from the Peru margin, whereas sequences related to the
genus Desulfomicrobium and to Desulfoarculus baarsii were found
exclusively in sediments from the Black Sea. A comparatively high
proportion of dsrA sequences (20%) related to D. acrylicus were
found in Peru margin deeply buried sediments at 121 mbsf. A spe-
ciﬁc feature of this anoxic, sulfate-reducing bacterium is the ability
to switch from sulfate to acrylate reduction once this is energet-
ically more favorable (van der Maarel et al., 1996). In contrast
to dsrA sequences showing habitat speciﬁcity, sequences related
to Desulfococcus oleovorans, Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, and
Desulfotalea psychrophila were detected in sediments at both sites.
Members of the genera Desulfococcus and Desulfobacterium belong

to the family of Desulfobacteraceae that are known to be able to
oxidize a great variety of different electron donors completely to
CO2. Thus, they successfully inhabit anoxic marine environments
such as Black Sea and Peru margin sediments (Ravenschlag et al.,
2000; Liu et al., 2003; Mußmann et al., 2005; Kondo et al., 2007;
Leloup et al., 2007, 2009) or the anoxic water column of the Black
Sea (Vetriani et al., 2003; Neretin et al., 2007) and other marine
habitats (Kondo et al., 2007). Besides dsrA sequences afﬁliated to
Desulfobacteraceae, also numerous aprA sequences belonging to
this family were detected in samples from the Black Sea and Peru
margin sediments indicating that bacteria of this community play
an important role in sulfate reduction in these sediments.

Only two dsrA sequences, isolated from sediment of the Black
Sea, showed a distant relationship (71% amino acid similarity)
to the sulfate-reducing archaeon (SRA) Archaeoglobus fulgidus.
Primarily SRA of the genus Archaeoglobus were isolated from
marine hydrothermal systems, North Sea oil ﬁelds, and from petro-
leum hydrocarbon-rich Guaymas Basin sediments off the coast
of Mexico (Hartzell and Reed, 2006). A few dsrA sequences, allo-
cated within the same cluster, could be isolated from other habitats
as from the Nankai Trough deep-sea and Black Sea sediments
(Kaneko et al., 2007; Leloup et al., 2007), and showed however
also only a distant relationship to dsrA sequences of the genus

Archaeoglobus. Because of this distant relationship and the fact that
Black Sea sediments are not a typical habitat for SRA, the afﬁliation
of these sequences to the genus Archaeoglobus is questionable. SRA
may play only a minor role in these sediments because of the low
numbers of detected dsrA sequences, and the lack of aprA clones
related to SRA.

The afﬁliation of dsrA sequences of two clone families, named
cluster A and B, could not be clearly identiﬁed. Sequences within
the cluster A form a clearly separated branch based on their unique
sequence signature and showed only distant similarities to aprA
of A. fulgidus (70–71% amino acid similarity). The cluster B was
generated by 24 different dsrA sequences isolated from sediments
of both habitats from each depth. Within this cluster numerous
dsrA clone sequences isolated from different marine sediments
as from deep-sea sediments from the Nankai Trough (Kaneko
et al., 2007) and the Guaymas Basin (Dhillon et al., 2003), but
also from salt marsh sediments (Bahr et al., 2005), and fen soil
(Loy et al., 2004) are represented (data not showed). The clos-
est described relatives based on amino acid similarity searches are
dsrA sequences from the archaeon A. fulgidus (65–76% amino acid
sequence similarity), the SRB of the genus Thermodesulfovibrio
of the class Nitrospira (63–76% amino acid sequence similarity),
and gram-positive SRB of the genus Desulfotomaculum (61–73%

amino acid sequence similarity). Because of the distant relation-
ship to dsrA sequences from characterized microorganisms, the
conclusion about the afﬁliation of the dsrA sequences of the
cluster B to either SRA or SRB remains speculative. The com-
mon distribution of these dsrA sequences along the depth proﬁles
of the two habitats and their high proportion within the clone
libraries, up to 75%, argue for a signiﬁcant role in sulfate/sulﬁte
reduction of these microorganisms in marine sediments. They
seem to be generalists and can adapt to a wide range of sulfate
concentrations and electron donors, and it is tempting to sup-
pose that they are a dominant group within the community of

sulfate reducers in the anoxic sediments from the Black Sea and
the Peru margin. Another unlike possibility could be that these
dsrA sequences originate from microorganisms, which still con-
tain this gene but have lost their ancestral ability of dissimilatory
sulfate/sulﬁte reduction as shown for some members of Desulfo-
tomaculum subcluster Ih (Imachi et al., 2006). This scenario would
explain the unsuccessful cultivation of sulfate reducers related to
the cluster B so far, because of incorrect selection of electron
acceptors.

In summary of the dsrA diversity study, it can be concluded
that this metabolic gene for the sulfate/sulﬁte reduction could

be detected in all analyzed sediment layers demonstrating a high
diversity. Even in deeply buried sediments from the Peru mar-
gin in depths of 65 and 121 mbsf dsrA sequences were identiﬁed.
Surprisingly, also in such an extreme habitat these sequences
showed a high diversity belonging to well characterized genera
as Desulfobacterium and Desulfococcus of the family Desulfobac-
teraceae, and Desulfovibrio, but also to novel deep-branching clus-
ters A and B which phylogenetic afﬁliation and thus metabolism
remain hidden. The presence of aprA and dsrA sequences afﬁl-
iated to the same phylogenetic clusters, for example genera of
the family Desulfobacteraceae or the genera Syntrophobacter and
Desulfacinum, showed that sulfate reducers of equal phylogen-
esis were detected. This is particularly demonstrative for aprA
and dsrA clone libraries from the Black Sea sediment of 2.7 mbsf
depth showing that almost all aprA sequences (98%) and all
dsrA sequences (100%) are afﬁliated either to D. elongatus or
to D. psychrophila, respectively. The aprA and dsrA phylogeny
of these two SRP of the family Desulfobulbaceae showed a close

relationship to each other indicating that aprA and dsrA sequences
detected in the Black Sea sediments could originate from the same
bacterium.

Conclusively, although SRP do not belong to the most abun-
dant prokaryotic groups, this study shows that they represent an
inherent, diverse part of the microbial community in Black Sea
sediments and the deep biosphere of Peru margin.
