In natural environments microorganisms commonly exist as communities of multiple
species that are capable of performing more varied and complicated tasks than clonal
populations. Synthetic biologists have engineered clonal populations with characteristics
such as differentiation, memory, and pattern formation, which are usually associated with
more complex multicellular organisms. The prospect of designing microbial communities
has alluring possibilities for environmental, biomedical, and energy applications, and is likely
to reveal insight into how natural microbial consortia function. Cell signaling and commu-
nication pathways between different species are likely to be key processes for designing
novel functions in synthetic and natural consortia. Recent efforts to engineer synthetic
microbial interactions will be reviewed here, with particular emphasis given to research
with signiﬁcance for industrial applications in the ﬁeld of biomining and bioremediation of
acid mine drainage.

INTRODUCTION
Natural microbial consortia are known to facilitate a wide range of
complex tasks such as inter-species bioﬁlm formation that allows
microorganisms to persist in inhospitable environments (Keller
and Surette, 2006). Syntrophic degradation of complex molecules
also allows two species to complete metabolic reactions from
which neither species would gain energy without the coopera-
tion of the other (Zhou et al., 2011). Consortia play a crucial role
in the human gut microbiome (Kau et al., 2011) and are known
to heavily inﬂuence the ecological dynamics of the marine com-
munity (Giovannoni and Vergin, 2012). Humans have made use
of natural consortia for millennia and selected them for better
performance or desired properties in areas such as dairy process-
ing (Reid, 2012), beer, and wine fermentation (Di Maio et al.,
2012), and more recently in biogas processing (Lynd et al., 2002)
and biomining (Rawlings, 2007).

The ﬁeld of synthetic biology has developed a wide range
of highly engineered clonal populations of bacteria to perform
complex tasks such as differentiation (Süel et al., 2006), memory
(Ham et al., 2008), counting (Friedland et al., 2009), and pattern
formation (Liu et al., 2011a) as well as industrial applications such
as production of antimalarial drug precursors (Ro et al., 2006),
fuel like long-chain alcohols (Atsumi et al., 2008), and biosensors
for arsenic in drinking water (Stocker et al., 2003). The construc-
tion and analysis of synthetic gene circuits has not only provided us
with new tools for genetic engineering but has given deeper insight
into naturally occurring gene circuits, their evolution, architec-
tures, and properties as well (Sprinzak and Elowitz, 2005; Ça˘gatay
et al., 2009; Elowitz and Lim, 2010).

Considering that most synthetic circuits have been engi-
neered in clonal populations it has been proposed that engi-
neering synthetic consortia may allow for more complex tasks
in industrial applications (Brenner et al., 2008; Sabra et al., 2010;

Momeni et al., 2011). Synthetic consortia may empower scien-
tists and engineers to cultivate and make use of some of the 99%
percent of microbes that have not been cultured yet and also to
elucidate the role of the many genes that have yet unknown func-
tion(s), which might well be of particular relevance in microbial
consortia (Wintermute and Silver, 2010). So far several proof-of-
concept and industrial synthetic consortia have been engineered
and reviewed (Brenner et al., 2008; Rollié et al., 2012); highlighted
by a recent review focusing on engineered communication and
biofuel processing (Shong et al., 2012).

The industrial practice of biomining (Olson et al., 2003) and
bioremediation of heavy metal contaminations (Haferburg and
Kothe, 2010) could potentially beneﬁt from synthetic consortia as
natural consortia have been shown to play crucial roles in these
processes. This review focuses on using microbial isolates to con-
struct consortia that would otherwise not be found together in
Nature and discusses the potential use of genetically engineered
species in bioremediation and biomining processes.

MICROBIAL CONSORTIA IN BIOMINING
BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN METAL RECOVERY
Biomining entails the use of acidophilic microbes to facilitate the
recovery process of metals from sulﬁde minerals in the processes
of bioleaching and biooxidation. Biooxidation is the enrichment
of metals, particularly gold, by mobilization and thus removal of
interfering metal sulﬁdes from ores bearing the precious met-
als (Rohwerder et al., 2003). Bioleaching is the solubilization of
metals of interest such as cobalt, copper, and nickel from sul-
ﬁde minerals. The two processes are industrially well established
and are commercially applied worldwide (Rawlings, 2007). The
microbes found in these environments are (extreme) acidophiles
growing at a pH of 3 or lower and span a wide range of different
phyla. The majority belong to the bacterial and archaea domains;

Engineering microbial consortia

however, unicellular eukaryotes have also been reported (Baker
and Banﬁeld, 2003; Bonnefoy and Holmes, 2011).

The impact of microbial consortia in bioleaching, particularly
in copper recovery, is widely recognized in literature and indus-
try (Olson et al., 2003; Rohwerder et al., 2003). Microorganisms
oxidize both sulfur and iron of sulﬁde minerals, such as pyrite.
It is generally accepted that leaching takes place via an “indi-
rect” mechanism, which can be divided into the “contact” and
“non-contact” mode (Baker and Banﬁeld, 2003; Rohwerder et al.,
2003). The “indirect” mechanism assumes that chemoautotrophic
iron-oxidizing microorganisms like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans
or Leptospirillum ferrooxidans generate ferric ions by oxidation of
ferrous iron (Rawlings, 2002). During the “non-contact” mode
planktonic microbes oxidize aqueous ferrous ions to ferric ions,
which in turn attack the mineral surface by chemical oxidation.
The “contact” mode assumes a small reaction space between the
microbial cell wall and the mineral surface where ferric ions are
concentrated in bioﬁlms for a localized attack of the sulﬁde min-
eral. Either mode yields different intermediate and ﬁnal sulfur
species depending on the ore leached. The thiosulfate mecha-
nism applies for acid-insoluble metal sulﬁdes such as molybdenite
2−
(MoS2) and pyrite (FeS2), and eventually yields sulfate (SO4
)
as the main end product. The so-called polysulﬁde mechanism
applies for acid-soluble metal sulﬁdes such as arsenopyrite (FeAsS)
and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), eventually yielding elemental sul-
fur as the main end product (Rawlings, 2002; Rohwerder et al.,
2003). Accumulating sulfur layers may act as a leaching inhibitor
because of sterically impeding the ferric ion attack on the ore and
thus affecting the growth of iron-oxidizing microbes. Chalcopy-
rite leaching is particularly sensitive to inactivation by formation
of jarosite layers as a function of redox potential and is thus
one of the most recalcitrant ore to leach (Viramontes-Gamboa
et al., 2010). These sulfur layers however can be oxidized to sol-
uble sulfate by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus
caldus or Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (Dopson and Lindstrom,
1999; Sand et al., 2001; Mangold et al., 2011). Hence naturally
occurring consortia of autotrophic iron-oxidizing microbes and
sulfur-oxidizing microbes have been proposed to be symbiotic,
potentially mutualistic (Rawlings et al., 1999) or at least synergetic
in substrate use (Johnson, 1998; Roger Morin in Donati and Sand,
2007, 136).

COMMUNICATION IN NATURAL BIOMINING CONSORTIA
Research on extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of A. fer-
rooxidans suggests that bioﬁlm formation, which is crucial for the
contact leaching mechanism, leads to an increase in redox poten-
tial and thus increase leaching rates as iron ions are trapped in the
EPS (Sand and Gehrke, 2006). It is known that communication
plays a major role in microbial bioﬁlm formation (McDougald
et al., 2012). The model bioleaching organism A. ferrooxidans pro-
duces and responds to compounds of the acyl homoserine lactones
(AHLs) family used in auto-inducer 1 (AI-1) type quorum-sensing
(QS) system (Keller and Surette, 2006) as well as to the c-di-
GMP pathway (Hengge, 2009), which is also employed in QS. Two
loci have been identiﬁed encoding for AHL synthases, the clas-
sical LuxI-type afeI acyl synthase (Farah et al., 2005; Rivas et al.,
2005) and act which is related to the LPA acyltransferase family

(Rivas et al., 2007). Both systems are involved in response to iron
and sulfur substrates respectively, though act may be alternatively
(or additionally) involved in cell membrane formation via fatty
acid synthesis which is yet to be elucidated (Valdés et al., 2008).
Recent studies also suggest a role of AHL-mediated QS in resis-
tance toward high copper concentrations (Wenbin et al., 2011).
The existence of a c-di-GMP pathway in A. ferrooxidans was dis-
covered by analysis of its genome sequence (Ruiz et al., 2007).
The pathway has been shown to respond to changes of the ener-
getic substrate (iron and sulfur) as well as to the lifestyle of the
bacteria (planktonic or bioﬁlm-associated growth) by determi-
nation of intracellular c-di-GMP levels (Ruiz et al., 2011). Even
though AHL type QS systems are absent from A. caldus and
A. thiooxidans as inferred by genome analysis (Valdés et al., 2008),
sequence analysis of the psychrotolerant Acidithiobacillus ferrivo-
rans SS3 performed in our group (unpublished) suggests presence
of an AHL type QS as we were able to identify an act homolog
with 84% identity giving rise to the possibility for inter-species
communication. Potential inter-species communication may also
occur via the more common c-di-GMP QS. Related genes and the
signaling compound were identiﬁed and isolated from A. caldus
and A. thiooxidans (Castro et al., 2009). As bioﬁlm formation is
crucial for the leaching process it may be suitable to modulate
AHL- and c-di-GMP levels to optimize attachment to ore particles
for example, which may enhance bioleaching processes. How-
ever, although the existence of the above-mentioned pathways
suggests that QS regulated bioﬁlm formation plays a role in min-
eral solubilization, further experiments are required to prove this
assumption.

CONSORTIA OF NATURALLY OCCURRING SPECIES
Whereas most studies have been performed on pure cultures
of A. ferrooxidans, many early studies characterized mixed cul-
tures of bioleaching organisms, mainly due to the difﬁculty in
full separation of species in natural consortia (Harrison, 1984).
Hence naturally occurring consortia have been characterized as
well as deﬁned consortia of naturally occurring organisms in
order to elucidate mechanisms and synergies that improve the
leaching process (Rawlings and Johnson, 2007). The impact of
natural consortia was shown to be profound. In one example, a
synergetic effect was observed by Qiu et al. (2005) during chal-
copyrite leaching with a deﬁned consortia of A. ferrooxidans and
A. thiooxidans. The mixed culture was more efﬁcient at leach-
ing chalcopyrite than the pure cultures. The authors concluded
that co-culture reduced the formation of inhibiting jarosite lay-
ers by the generation of sulfuric acid due to sulfur oxidation of
A. thiooxidans.

Employment of heterotrophic acidophiles to remove inhibiting
organic compounds that accumulate during growth led to acceler-
ation of the leaching process. This was attributed to the increased
growth rate of A. ferrooxidans while it was co-cultured with the
heterotroph Acidiphilium acidophilum (Liu et al., 2011b).

Further examples for advantages of consortia are increased acid
production (Okibe and Johnson, 2004), improved attachment to
mineral surfaces (Noël et al., 2010), increased growth, and leaching
rates (Bacelar-Nicolau and Johnson, 1999; Okibe and Johnson,
2004; Fu et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2011d; Naghavi et al., 2011).

Engineering microbial consortia

While some of the above-mentioned consortia are most likely to
occur in nature, engineering deﬁned natural consortia has opened
new possibilities for enhanced bioleaching (Rawlings and Johnson,
2007). Considering that researchers can choose from a wide range
of microbes from different geographic locations, there is poten-
tial for additional, yet unexplored synergetic effects that may arise
as these artiﬁcially assembled microbial consortia would not be
encountered in nature. The use of consortia assembled from nat-
urally occurring species is furthermore interesting because they
would not be considered genetically modiﬁed and are hence not
susceptible to regulatory procedures.

CONSORTIA OF NATURAL AND ENGINEERED SPECIES
To our best knowledge, hybrid consortia consisting of geneti-
cally engineered and naturally occurring bioleaching bacteria have
not been reported so far. Even though some bioleaching organ-
isms, in particular those of the Acidithiobacillus genus have been
successfully transformed, genetic manipulations are difﬁcult as
transformation efﬁciencies are extremely low (Kusano et al., 1992;
Peng et al., 1994). In fact only two knockouts (Liu et al., 2000;
Wang et al., 2012) and two expression mutants have been reported
in the scientiﬁc literature. One rus overexpressing A. ferrooxidans
strain and another expressing the mer determinant for a mer-
cury resistant A. caldus strain (Chen et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011c).
Once more suitable transformation protocols have been devel-
oped, it may be feasible to modulate QS signals with engineered
microbes by either attenuating or amplifying natural signals or
sending artiﬁcial signals to promote bioﬁlm formation or mobi-
lization respectively as recently demonstrated with engineered
E. coli cells (Hong et al., 2012). Interestingly, it has been shown
that once an initial consortia has been established, the power of
evolution can be used to drive novel species interactions poten-
tially resulting in increased consortia stability and productivity
(Hansen et al., 2007).

Ultimately, engineered consortia could be deployed in indus-
trial scale heap and tank leaching operations to improve bioleach-
ing and biooxidation processes. However, as highlighted by
Rawlings and Johnson (2007) it is crucial to consider that the
tailored consortia have to compete with other microbes and their
associated consortia in the non-sterile leaching environment. Usu-
ally this is not too much of a problem as the fastest growing species
is usually the one leading to increased leaching. Depending on
the ore leached, however, in particular chalcopyrite ores, high
redox potential, which is associated with dominant iron-oxidizing
microbes such as A. ferrooxidans or L. ferrooxidans is not appre-
ciated as the continuous leaching process will stall after an initial
high rate of recovery (Ohata et al., 2010).

Furthermore, hybrid consortia might be used to culture many
of the yet uncultured microbes. There are abundant microbes in
acid environments which are still to be cultured, characterized and
their role in the ecosystem to be elucidated (Baker et al., 2010).

MICROBIAL CONSORTIA IN ACID MINE DRAINAGE
BIOREMEDIATION
One major environmental consequence of industries such as min-
ing, galvanic processing, and construction is the possibility of
acid rock drainage (ARD) or in the particular case of mining,

acid mine drainage (AMD), where wastewater efﬂuents and mine
run-off are not properly managed. AMD may occur where access
of oxidants to sulﬁde minerals, in particular pyrite, is facilitated
due to mining operations as the surface area of the minerals is
increased (Baker and Banﬁeld, 2003). Both inorganic and biologi-
cal reactions drive the acidiﬁcation and heavy metal contamination
of water due to oxidation of sulﬁde minerals (Ma and Banﬁeld,
2011). The biological reactions account for the gross of AMD
production with estimates as high as 75% (Baker and Banﬁeld,
2003). The same organisms and consortia that are used in bio-
mining operations are the major contributors to AMD generation,
though AMD bioﬁlms are mainly dominated by the chemoau-
totrophic Nitrospirae phylum bacteria Leptospirillum spp. (Gadd,
2009; Wilmes et al., 2009). AMD is dealt with usually in two ways,
either by migration control or source control in case the axiom
“prevention is better than cure” is feasible (Johnson and Hall-
berg, 2005; Das et al., 2009). In industrial environments AMD is
usually managed at source by neutralization of wastewater and
run-offs in rather costly abiotic neutralization processes with
limestone. Therefore, the above-mentioned microbes and their
bioﬁlm environments are an interesting target for AMD manage-
ment. Abiotic AMD mitigation control options as well as biological
remediation processes have been recently reviewed (Johnson and
Hallberg, 2005; Gadd, 2009) and are beyond the scope of this
review. We will therefore focus on the few examples of biolog-
ical AMD source control of AMD and discuss potential future
applications.

Johnson et al. (2007) reported the use of heterotrophic aci-
dophiles to colonize pyrite prior to exposure to iron-oxidizing
bacteria to reduce dissolution of the mineral. The process, named
“bioshrouding” was capable of decreasing the dissolution rate
between 57 and 75%. This was presumably due to the het-
erotrophs’ bioﬁlm that impeded attachment of the autotrophic
iron-oxidizer. It remains to be seen if this approach is viable in
industrial scale operations as iron-oxidizing autotrophs may out-
compete the heterotrophs in the non-sterile environment though
their growth could be impeded by the necessary supply of artiﬁ-
cial carbon sources such as yeast extracts to foster the growth of
the heterotrophs, which is known to inhibit growth of autotrophic
organisms (Harrison, 1984).

Eukaryotic organisms such as algae and fungi have been
reported in aquatic AMD environments, and could be engineered
to mitigate AMD. Their natural role and potential application in
bioremediation of AMD has been recently reviewed (Das et al.,
2009). Engineering these eukaryotes for quenching of QS may
be a very attractive option as resistance to quenching is unlikely
to evolve (Defoirdt et al., 2010) and a broad range of quench-
ing mechanisms are available. One example is the production
of AI-1 type interfering halogenated furanones secreted by the
algae Delisea pulchra (Czajkowski and Jafra, 2009). These small
molecules mimic bacterial QS compounds and thus interfere with
bacterial signaling and bioﬁlm colonization.

Furthermore, the use of tailored bacteriophages and viruses
(Lu and Collins, 2007) could potentially impede bioﬁlm formation
of autotrophs as naturally occurring viruses have been reported
in AMD environments (Andersson and Banﬁeld, 2008; Denef
et al., 2010). Engineers employing this approach would have to

Engineering microbial consortia

contend with bacterial defense mechanisms. The CRISPR (for
Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) inter-
ference mechanisms are one such strategy bacteria and archaea
use to evade phage treatment. Exogenous DNA is inactivated and
processed to small elements of ∼30 bp due to proteins encoded
by the CRISPR-associated (cas) genes. These are then incorpo-
rated into the CRISPR locus from which they are constitutively
expressed, processed and remain with an accompanying ﬂanking
region. The resulting CRISPR RNA (crRNA) binds to complemen-
tary RNA or DNA molecules and recruits Cas proteins to cleave
the targeted nucleic acid depending on the organism (Marrafﬁni
and Sontheimer, 2010). This system has been used to ratio-
nally engineer crRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage in the extreme
thermophilic archaea Pyrococcus furiosus using the native Cmr
protein (Hale et al., 2012). Desired beneﬁcial strains and consor-
tia could therefore be potentially rendered “immune” by CRISPR
engineering.

synthetic consortia will also seep into other industrial sectors,
which are currently mainly abiotic processes as microbial consor-
tia are capable of more complex behaviors due to the combined
properties of the individual organisms and the additional layers of
regulation and adaptation to changing conditions.

The engineering of consortia will also be aided by the further
characterization of the diverse species in bioleaching environ-
ments, which may have unique metabolic and physiological
features. Prime candidates are the abundant archaea in biomining
processes, which have not yet been subject to thorough research
and are an untapped ﬁeld of biological resources for industrial
applications. The design and construction of synthetic and mixed
microbial consortia will not only become a powerful tool in opti-
mizing industrial processes but will also give us an insight into the
evolution and emergence of naturally occurring microbial con-
sortia. This will foster our understanding of higher-level system
organization that is indispensible for designing complex functions.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
The ability to design and manipulate microbial consortia may
allow biologists and engineers to enhance mineral recovery in bio-
mining processes beyond the yields and productivities observed
with naturally occurring consortia. Furthermore, it is likely that
