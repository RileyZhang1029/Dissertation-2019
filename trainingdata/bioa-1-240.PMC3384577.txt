Various microscopic techniques have 

been  developed  to  understand  the 
mechanisms that spatiotemporally con-
trol actin filament dynamics in live cells. 
Kinetic  data  on  the  processes  of  actin 
assembly  and  disassembly  on  F-actin 
have  been  accumulated.  However,  the 
kinetics  of  cytoplasmic  G-actin,  a  key 
determinant  for  actin  polymerization, 
has remained unclear because of a lack 
of appropriate methods to measure the 
G-actin  concentration  quantitatively. 
We have developed two new microscopic 
techniques  based  on  the  fluorescence 
decay  after  photoactivation  (FDAP) 
time-lapse 
imaging  of  photoswitch-
able  Dronpa-labeled  actin.  These  tech-
niques, sequential FDAP (s-FDAP) and 
multipoint FDAP, were used to measure 
the  time-dependent  changes  in  and 
spatial distribution of the G-actin con-
centration  in  live  cells.  Use  of  s-FDAP 
provided data on changes in the G-actin 
concentration with high temporal reso-
lution;  these  data  were  useful  for  the 
model  analysis  of  actin  assembly  pro-
cesses in live cells. The s-FDAP analysis 
also  provided  evidence  that  the  cyto-
plasmic G-actin concentration substan-
tially  decreases  after  cell  stimulation 
and that the extent of stimulus-induced 
actin  assembly  and  cell  size  extension 
are linearly correlated with the G-actin 
concentration  before  cell  stimulation. 
The  advantages  of  using  s-FDAP  and 
multipoint FDAP to measure spatiotem-
poral G-actin dynamics and the roles of 
G-actin concentration and ADF/cofilin 
in stimulus-induced actin assembly and 
lamellipodium extension in live cells are 
discussed.

Actin  filament  dynamics  and  architec-
ture in cells are highly organized in space 
and time. Cells integrate intracellular and 
extracellular signals to regulate the activi-
ties  of  various  actin  regulatory  proteins 
and  actin  filament  reorganization,  which 
leads  to  cell  migration,  morphogenesis 
and  division.  To  understand  the  mecha-
nisms that spatiotemporally regulate actin 
filament  dynamics  and  architecture  in 
cells, various microscopic techniques have 
been  developed.  These  techniques  have 
provided quantitative data on the kinetics 
of actin filament dynamics that are useful 
for mathematical model analysis.1,2 In par-
ticular, the technique of fluorescence sin-
gle-molecule speckle imaging, which can 
be  used  to  observe  directly  the  behavior 
of  single  fluorescence-labeled  molecules 
attached to actin filaments, has provided 
extensive kinetic data on the processes of 
actin  filament  assembly  and  disassembly 
in live cells.2

 During migration, cells extend F-actin-
rich lamellipodia at their leading edge. In 
lamellipodia, dendritic arrays of actin fila-
ments  are  constructed  with  fast-growing 
barbed ends directed to the plasma mem-
brane. Actin polymerization at the barbed 
end  generates  a  physical  force  to  push 
the  plasma  membrane  forward,  resulting 
in  lamellipodium  extension.  Next,  new 
focal  adhesions  are  formed  in  the  lamel-
lipodium,  and  the  actomyosin  contrac-
tion force pulls the cell body forward. In 
principle, cells migrate by cycling through 
these  steps.  Actin  polymerization-based 
lamellipodium protrusion is the first and 
most  important  step  in  cell  migration. 
Lamellipodia  sense  environmental  cues 
around the cell and determine the potency

Dp  is  a  GFP-like  photochromic  pro-
tein  whose  fluorescence  can  be  reversibly 
and repeatedly photoactivated and photo-
bleached by irradiation with light.11 After 
photobleaching  the  whole  cell,  Dp-actin 
was  photoactivated  in  a  small  region  of 
the  cytoplasm,  and  the  time-dependent 
change  in  fluorescence  intensity  in  the 
photoactivated region was measured (Fig. 
1A).  Fluorescence  intensity  in  the  pho-
toactivated  region  decreased  quickly  due 
to  the  diffusion  of  Dp-labeled  G-actin. 
Because the rate of the fluorescence decay 
of Dp-actin was much faster than the rate 
of  F-actin  disassembly,  the  FDAP  value 
primarily  reflects  the  amount  of  G-actin 
(mobile fraction of Dp-actin) in the local 
area of the cytoplasm. The contribution of 
F-actin disassembly to the FDAP value is 
negligible at least in the initial phase after 
photoactivation.

The  fluorescence  recovery  after  pho-
tobleaching  (FRAP)  of  GFP-actin  was 
also  utilized  to  assess  the  local  amount 
of  G-actin.12  However,  FDAP  analysis 
has an advantage over FRAP analysis for 
quantifying  the  amount  of  G-actin  with 
high signal-to-noise ratio: the fluorescence 
signal  in  the  region  of  interest  (ROI)  is 
maximal at the beginning of FDAP mea-
surements  but  minimal  at  the  beginning 
of FRAP measurements. The FDAP anal-
ysis revealed that the cytoplasmic G-actin 
concentration was decreased by the inacti-
vation or depletion of ADF/cofilin to less 
than half of the concentration in control 
cells.10 This result provides clear evidence 
that ADF and cofilin play a central role in 
the production and maintenance  of high 
concentration of cytoplasmic G-actin.10 A 
similar approach can be used to evaluate 
the  contributions  of  other  actin  regula-
tory proteins to the control of cytoplasmic 
G-actin concentration.

In 

the  cytoplasm, 

the  ability  of 
G-actin  to  polymerize  to  F-actin  is  con-
trolled  by  its  state  of  association  with 
G-actin-binding  proteins.  Major  com-
ponents  of  the  cytoplasmic  G-actin  pool 
are 
free  ATP-G-actin,  profilin-bound 
and  thymosin-β4-bound  ATP-G-actin, 
and  ADF/cofilin-bound  ADP-G-actin. 
Free  ATP-G-actin  and  profilin-bound 
ATP-G-actin  are  polymerizable,  whereas 
thymosin-β4-bound  ATP-G-actin  and 
ADF/cofilin-bound  ADP-G-actin

photoactivation (FDAp). Dp-actin expressed in the cell was prebleached to the background level, 
and a Dic image was acquired. After photoactivation, time-lapse images were acquired. the

ficient of Dp-actin.9 (B) s-FDAp analysis. Fluorescence images were acquired before (blue) and at 0

0 and 40 ms after photoactivation.

and  directionality  of  cell  migration  by 
dynamically changing their morphology 
in response to these cues.3,4

Fluorescence  single-molecule  speckle 
imaging  has  provided  many  kinetic 
parameters  of  actin  and  actin-binding 
proteins  on  F-actin,  which  underlie 
the  dynamic  behavior  of  lamellipodia, 
including the rate of mDia (FH1-FH2)-
mediated  F-actin  elongation  (2  μm  s−1), 
the rates of dissociation of Arp2/3 (0.048 
sec−1)  and  capping  protein  (0.58  sec−1) 
from F-actin, and the rate of F-actin dis-
assembly  (0.03  sec−1)  in  lamellipodia.5-7 
Thus,  substantial  kinetic  data  on  actin 
and  actin-binding  proteins  in  the  pro-
cesses  from  actin  assembly  to  disassem-
bly  on  F-actin  have  been  accumulated. 
In  contrast,  kinetic  data  on  G-actin 
and its binding proteins in the processes 
after  actin  disassembly  and  before  actin 
assembly  (which  occur  primarily  in  the 
cytosol)  have  remained 
insufficiently 
characterized, owing to a lack of appro-
priate methods to measure the changes in 

G-actin  concentration  quantitatively  in 
live cells.

In most cells, the cytoplasmic G-actin 
concentration (~100 μM) is much higher 
than  the  critical  concentration  at  the 
barbed  end  of  an  actin  filament  (~0.1 
μM).8  The  high  concentration  of  cyto-
plasmic G-actin is maintained by several 
factors: (1) the supply of actin monomers 
via  actin-depolymerizing  factor  (ADF)/
cofilin-mediated  F-actin  disassembly; 
(2)  the  prevention  of  spontaneous  actin 
nucleation  by  G-actin-sequestering  pro-
teins,  profilin  and  thymosin-β4;  and 
(3) the interruption of actin assembly by 
F-actin-capping proteins. To evaluate the 
contribution of each actin regulatory pro-
tein to the maintenance of high cytoplas-
mic  G-actin,  it  is  essential  to  quantify 
the  cellular  G-actin  concentration.  To 
assess  the  cytoplasmic  G-actin  concen-
tration in live cells, time-lapse analysis of 
fluorescence  decay  after  photoactivation 
(FDAP)  of  Dronpa  (Dp)-labeled  actin 
was used (Fig. 1A).9,10

thymosin-β4-bound g-actin (D). temporal changes in FDAp values were measured after the treatment of mcF-7 cells with Jasp at various concentra-
tions. cellular concentrations of free g-actin, profilin-bound g-actin, thymosin-β4-bound g-actin, and the free barbed and pointed ends of F-actin 
were estimated by a differential equation model.9 With these concentrations and the chemical reaction equations in reference 9, the time course of 
the concentration of each component was plotted by KinSim. the free barbed end concentration is constant in the chemical reaction equations.

nonpolymerizable.13-15  Although  most 
cytoplasmic  G-actin  consists  of  nonpo-
lymerizable  thymosin-β4-bound  ATP-G-
actin, this complex is readily converted to 
free  ATP-G-actin  when  the  free  G-actin 
concentration is reduced by an increase in 
the actin assembly rate or a decrease in the 
actin disassembly rate.16 Thus, thymosin-
β4-bound  ATP-G-actin  also  contributes 
to actin assembly by acting as a reservoir 
of  ATP-G-actin.  Kinetic  data  on  these 
biochemical  reactions  in  actin  dynamics 
have been extensively studied in the cell-
free system.14,16

To investigate the mechanisms of intra-
cellular  reactions  of  G-actin  dynamics, 
such as G-actin disassembly from F-actin, 
G-actin assembly to F-actin, and the inter-
actions  between  G-actin  and  its  regulat-
ing  proteins,  it  is  essential  to  measure 
time-dependent  changes  in  cytoplasmic 
G-actin  concentration  in  live  cells  quan-
titatively  and  with  high  temporal  resolu-
tion.  As  described  above,  the  amount  of 
cytoplasmic  G-actin  can  be  assessed  by 

FDAP  analysis  of  Dp-actin.  Because  Dp 
is  a  unique  protein  whose  fluorescence 
can be reversibly and repeatedly switched 
on and off, Dp-actin is a useful probe for 
sequential measurements of FDAP. These 
characteristics  allow 
the  quantitative 
analysis of time-dependent changes in the 
G-actin concentration in live cells.9

Sequential  FDAP  (s-FDAP)  analysis 
consists  of  repetitions  of  a  set  of  proce-
dures:  differential  interference  contrast 
(DIC) image acquisition, photobleaching 
of  the  whole  cell,  and  photoactivation  of 
a small (1.8 μm diameter circle) region of 
the  cytoplasm  (Fig.  1B).9  In  each  cycle, 
a  set  of  three  fluorescence  images  of  the 
photoactivated region was acquired before 
and  at  0  and  40  ms  after  photoactiva-
tion. The FDAP value, which reflects the 
G-actin  concentration,  was  calculated  as 
the  difference  between  the  fluorescence 
intensities at 0 and 40 ms after photoacti-
vation. The time point for image acquisi-
tion (40 ms after photoactivation) was set 
on the basis of the half-life of the mobile 

fraction  of  Dp-actin  (41  ms)  measured 
by  a  single  FDAP  analysis  under  similar 
conditions.  The  short-term  measurement 
of  FDAP  enables  s-FDAP  analysis  to 
measure temporal changes in the G-actin 
concentration  with  high  temporal  reso-
lution.  As  described  above,  the  effect  of 
F-actin disassembly on s-FDAP analysis is 
negligible.9,10

Fluorescence  correlation  spectroscopy 
(FCS) has been developed to measure the 
cytoplasmic  concentration  of  diffusive 
molecules.17,18  FCS  detects  the  number 
and diffusion time of fluorescence-labeled 
single molecules in the observed volume. 
Its  autocorrelation  function  is  calculated 
to determine the concentration and diffu-
sion coefficient of the fluorescent molecule 
in the cytoplasm. However, FCS can only 
measure  nanomolar  concentrations  of  a 
fluorescent molecule; high concentrations 
of fluorescent molecules make it difficult 
to  detect  each  fluorescent  molecule  sepa-
rately in the observed volume.18 Thus, FCS 
has an upper limit of the fluorescent signal

measuring  time  (typically  10  sec  x  5~10 
times).18 In addition, FCS is based on the 
premise that the concentration of fluores-
cent molecules does not change during the 
measuring time. Thus, FCS is unfavorable 
for measuring temporal changes in cyto-
plasmic  G-actin  concentration  because 
the changes in G-actin concentration are 
very fast in cells and a high temporal reso-
lution is required to measure them.9

time-dependent  changes 

The  s-FDAP  analysis  was  used  to 
measure 
in 
cytoplasmic  G-actin  concentration  after 
the  treatment  of  cells  with  an  F-actin-
stabilizing  drug,  jasplakinolide  (Jasp).9 
The FDAP value gradually decreased after 
Jasp treatment in a time- and dose-depen-
dent  manner.  The  high  temporal  resolu-
tion of s-FDAP analysis was sufficient to 
use  the  data  of  Jasp-induced  changes  in 
G-actin concentration for model analysis. 
In the best-fit model, the cellular concen-
trations  of  free  G-actin,  profilin-bound 
and  thymosin-β4-bound  G-actin,  and 
free barbed and pointed ends of actin fila-
ments in the untreated cell were estimated 
to  be  1.98  μM,  9.52  μM,  88.5  μM,  4.8 
nM and 5.52 nM, respectively, assuming 
that  the  total  concentrations  of  G-actin, 
profilin  and  thymosin-β4  were  100,  10 
and 200 μM, respectively.9 Based on these 
values, time courses of the concentrations 
of  each  component  after  Jasp  treatment 
were  estimated,  as  shown  in  Figure  2. 
Thus,  the  high  temporal  resolution  and 
quantitative  features  of  s-FDAP  analysis 
make it useful for estimating the cellular 
concentrations of key elements involved in 
the regulation of actin dynamics.

The s-FDAP analysis was also applied to 
measure the temporal changes in G-actin 
concentration  after  cell  stimulation  with 
neuregulin  (NRG),  a  growth  factor  that 
induces lamellipodium extension and cell 
migration.9 Results from s-FDAP analysis 
demonstrated that the G-actin concentra-
tion decreased by ~40% at 2–4 min after 
NRG stimulation and then reached a pla-
teau.  This  result  indicates  that  ~40%  of 
G-actin in the cytoplasm is polymerized to 
F-actin in response to NRG stimulation.9
The  s-FDAP  analysis  can  be  used  to 
measure  temporal  changes  in  cell  mor-
phology  by  DIC 
image  acquisition, 
simultaneously  with  changes  in  G-actin 

concentration, in individual live cells. The 
DIC  image  analysis  showed  that  the  cell 
area increased about 1.6-fold at 6–8 min 
after NRG stimulation, with a lag time of 
2–4 min after the decrease in cytoplasmic 
G-actin concentration. Data on the time-
lapse  fluorescence  analyses  of  YFP-actin 
localization  and  measurements  of  free 
barbed-end formation in NRG-stimulated 
cells suggest that the cytoplasmic G-actin 
is  used  for  F-actin  assembly  and  Arp2/3 
complex-mediated dendritic formation of 
barbed  ends  at  the  cell  periphery  in  the 
initial phase after NRG stimulation, and 
thereafter the cell area begins to extend.9

Because the rate of actin polymerization 
is proportional to the G-actin concentra-
tion in cell-free assays,19 it is reasonable to 
assume that the cytoplasmic G-actin con-
centration  is  a  critical  parameter  for  the 
intracellular rate of actin polymerization. 
However,  some  studies  have  paid  little 
attention to the role of G-actin concentra-
tion  in  stimulus-induced  actin  assembly 
and  lamellipodium  extension,  probably 
because  the  cytoplasmic  G-actin  is  more 
than enough for actin assembly. Thus, it 
remains unclear to what extent the cyto-
plasmic G-actin concentration contributes 
to  stimulus-induced  actin  assembly  and 
cell extension.

To address this issue, the G-actin con-
centration in cells was artificially reduced 
by  Jasp  treatment,  and  its  effects  on 
NRG-induced actin assembly and cell size 
extension were analyzed by s-FDAP.9 The 
extent  of  NRG-induced  actin  assembly 
(measured as the decrease in the cytoplas-
mic  G-actin  concentration)  and  cell  size 
extension  exhibited  a  linear  correlation 
with  the  G-actin  concentration  in  the 
prestimulated  cell.9  Strong  correlations 
over  a  wide  range  of  G-actin  concentra-
tions  indicate  that  the  extent  of  actin 
assembly and cell size extension after cell 
stimulation strongly depend on the cyto-
plasmic G-actin concentration before cell 
stimulation over a wide range of G-actin 
concentrations.

Inactivation  or  depletion  of  ADF/
cofilin  suppresses  stimulus-induced  actin 
assembly  and  lamellipodium  extension, 
indicating that ADF/cofilin plays a criti-
cal  role  in  these  processes.  In  general, 
the  rate  of  actin  assembly  depends  on 
the  concentrations  of  both  G-actin  and 

the free barbed ends of F-actin. Based on 
the  potency  of  ADF/cofilin  to  increase 
both  the  G-actin  concentration  and  free 
barbed ends, two models for the roles of 
ADF/cofilin  have  been  proposed:  ADF/
cofilin  contributes  to  stimulus-induced 
actin assembly and lamellipodium exten-
sion by (1) abundantly supplying G-actin 
to maintain a high concentration of cyto-
plasmic G-actin for polymerization,9,10 or 
(2) severing F-actin to create free barbed 
ends  that  are  used  as  nucleation  sites  for 
actin polymerization.20,21 We showed that 
the (1) inactivation or depletion of ADF/
cofilin remarkably decreases the cytoplas-
mic  G-actin  concentration, 
indicating 
that  ADF/cofilin  primarily  contributes 
to  the  maintenance  of  high  cytoplasmic 
concentrations  of  G-actin;  (2)  stimulus-
induced  actin  assembly  and  cell  exten-
sion  strongly  depend  on  the  cytoplasmic 
G-actin  concentration  in  the  prestimu-
lated cell; and (3) microinjection of actin 
monomers  into  ADF/cofilin-inactivated 
cells rescues actin assembly and cell exten-
sion.9,10  These  results  suggest  that  ADF/
cofilin  contributes  to  stimulus-induced 
actin assembly and cell extension by sup-
plying a large amount of G-actin into the 
cytoplasm,  thereby  maintaining  a  high 
concentration of cytoplasmic G-actin for 
polymerization.  Although  ADF/cofilin  is 
required for stimulus-induced barbed-end 
formation  at  the  cell  periphery,  it  prob-
ably  indirectly  supports  the  creation  of 
barbed ends by increasing the cytoplasmic 
G-actin  concentration  (which,  in  turn, 
accelerates the rate of actin polymerization 
and  increases  the  Arp2/3  complex-medi-
ated branching and barbed-end formation 
of actin filaments), rather than by directly 
creating  barbed  ends  via  their  F-actin-
severing activity.

The FDAP technique was also applied 
to  measure  the  spatial  distribution  of 
G-actin concentration by sequentially per-
forming single FDAP analyses at multiple 
points  in  a  live  cell.9  Multipoint  FDAP 
analysis of N1E-115 cells extending stable 
lamellipodia  has  shown  that  the  G-actin 
concentration  in  lamellipodia  is  compa-
rable to that in the cell body.9 This finding 
indicates  that  the  G-actin  concentration 
in lamellipodia is sufficiently high to sup-
port F-actin polymerization at the leading 
edge. Time-lapse fluorescence imaging has

rear  of  the  lamellipodia  rapidly  diffuses 
into the cytoplasm, and that cytoplasmic 
G-actin  is  effectively  incorporated  into 
F-actin  in  the  lamellipodia.10  Thus,  it  is 
likely  that  the  rapid  diffusion  of  a  large 
amount of cytoplasmic G-actin, which is 
much greater than the amount of G-actin 
generated  by  lamellipodial  F-actin  disas-
sembly in a given period of time, equalizes 
the  G-actin  concentrations  in  the  lamel-
lipodia and cell body. It will be interesting 
to  investigate  whether  or  not  the  spatial 
distribution of G-actin concentration dif-
fers in various types of migrating or polar-
ized cells.

In  motile  cells,  the  lamellipodium 
extends and retracts repeatedly.22,23 In the 
spontaneous  polarization  of  isotropically 
spreading  fibroblasts  and  keratocytes, 
membrane  retraction  in  the  prospective 
rear of the cell was initiated prior to direc-
tional  cell  movement.24,25  Actin  assembly 
and  disassembly  are  local  biochemical 
reactions  regulated  by  different  reaction 
components.  However, 
spatiotemporal 
linkage  between  these  reactions  suggests 
their coordination in the entire cell.

We  have  shown  that  the  change  in 
G-actin concentration in the cytoplasm is 
directly correlated with stimulus-induced 
actin  assembly  and  cell  extension.9 
Changes  in  the  total  G-actin  concentra-
tion  probably  alter  the  biochemical  reac-
tions  between  G-actin  and  its  regulatory 
proteins in the cytoplasm. In addition, the 
mDia1-mediated  nucleation  of  actin  fila-
ments is presumably regulated by fluctua-
tion  in  the  G-actin  concentration,26  and 
the rate of G-actin incorporation at the tip 
of the lamellipodium is linearly correlated 
with  the  cytoplasmic  G-actin  concentra-
tion.10  Thus,  the  quantitative  analysis 
of  the  correlations  between  cytoplasmic 
G-actin  concentration  and  kinetics  of 
local actin assembly/disassembly will shed 
light  on  the  molecular  mechanisms  by 
which  motile  cells  coordinate  local  actin 
assembly  and  disassembly  in  the  entire 
cell.

The  s-FDAP  and  multipoint  FDAP 
analyses are applicable to measure temporal 
and spatial changes in the concentrations 

of mobile components of various cytoskel-
etal and membrane-bound proteins in live 
cells. These techniques will serve to inves-
tigate the roles of these proteins in diverse 
cell  processes,  including  cell  migration, 
morphological changes and cytokinesis.
