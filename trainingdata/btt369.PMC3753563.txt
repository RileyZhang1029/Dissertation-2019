They are extremely relevant as diagnostic, biotechnological and therapeutic tools.
Their modular structure makes it easy to re-engineer them for specific purposes.
Short of undergoing a trial and error process, these experiments, as well as others, need to rely on an understanding of the specific deter- minants of the antibody binding mode.
Results: In this article, we present a method to identify, on the basis of the antibody sequence alone, which residues of an antibody directly interact with its cognate antigen.
The method, based on the random forest automatic learning techniques, reaches a recall and specificity as high as 80% and is implemented as a free and easy-to-use server, named prediction of Antibody Contacts.
We believe that it can be of great help in re-design experiments as well as a guide for molecular docking experiments.
The results that we obtained also allowed us to dissect which features of the antibody sequence contribute most to the involvement of specific residues in binding to the antigen.

Received on March 19, 2013  revised on June 13, 2013  accepted on June 18, 2013  1 INTRODUCTION  The past two decades have seen monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy come to age.
With 430 molecules approved for clinical practice and hundreds currently being tested, mAbs are rapidly emerging as one of the most important classes of biological therapeutics.
Despite their benefits, mABs obtained from both human and xenogeneic sources have some deficiencies, such as short in vivo life, low stability and high chances to raise an im- munogenic reaction in patients.
To overcome these hurdles, a number of strategies based on genetic recombination have been developed and optimized, which allow the modification and improvement of almost all the clinically relevant aspects of an antibody molecule but require expensive and time-demanding trial-and-error experimental procedures, a process that can be speeded up by the understanding of the structure and binding mode of the specific antibody (Morea et al., 2000).
The antibody molecule, with few exceptions, contains one or more tetramers of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, the heavy and the light  *To whom correspondence should be addressed.
chains.
Each chain consists of homologous domains, two for the light chain (one variable and one constant domain) and four or more for the heavy chain (one variable and three or more con- stant domains).
All the domains share a similar tertiary structure, the so-called immunoglobulin fold, which is characterized by two anti-parallel beta sheets.
The antigen-binding site (ABS) is mainly composed of six loops, three from the light and three from the heavy chain [also known as the hypervariable (HV) loops].
In a seminal study on antibody sequences (Wu and Kabat, 1970), such large variability was exploited to correctly define these HV sequence stretches as the complementarity deter- mining regions (CDRs) in antibody recognition.
Later studies (Novotny et al., 1983) confirmed that this definition largely over- laps with the structurally based definition of the ABS.
A number of other biological mechanisms are in place to increase the sequence diversity of antibody regions containing the ABS to enlarge the size of the antibody repertoire, and therefore the number of different antigens that can be targeted by the immune system (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007  Schatz and Swanson, 2011  Teng and Papavasiliou, 2007).
Analyses of the rapidly growing number of antibody crystal structures in complex with their antigens pointed out that, even though almost all the intermolecular interactions are made by residues in the CDR (Kunik et al., 2012  MacCallum et al., 1996), the specific interaction pattern of each antibody depends on a subset of residues within or outside the CDR regions that are important either to maintain the correct three-dimensional (3D) conformation (Narciso et al., 2011) or to specify the phy- sicochemical environment of the ABS.
Knowing the role played by a specific residue is a key aspect in antibody rational design and engineering.
This information can be inferred by analyzing the 3D structure of the antibody mol- ecule or, when the latter is not available, by building and analyz- ing its 3D model.
Modeling of antibody structures is a field that has attracted much attention, and available methods can pro- duce models of very good accuracy (Accelrys Software Inc., 2012  Marcatili et al., 2008  Molecular Operating Environment, 2012  Sircar et al., 2009  Whitelegg and Rees, 2000).
It should be noted here that antibody structure prediction still has pitfalls, mainly as far as the prediction of the conformation of the third HV loop of the heavy chain is concerned (Kuroda et al., 2012  Ramos, 2012  Sircar, 2012).
Despite the abundance of methods specifically devoted to the prediction and analysis of antibodies (Lefranc et al., 2009), few tools are available to provide information about the paratope, i.e.
the subset of residues that contact the antigen.
Paratome (Kunik et al., 2012) is a recently published online tool for  ÃŸ The Author 2013.

identification of antigen-binding region that extends the defin- ition of CDRs to include contacts outside the canonical ABS region.
However, Paratome does not provide any information on the specific residues that are directly involved in the binding, on the type of interaction (hydrogen bond, hydrophobic and other non-bonded interactions) or on the atoms involved in the interaction (main chain, side chain or both).
This information is of relevance for any type of antibody engineering experiment, such as in silico maturation.
To overcome this problem, we developed prediction of Antibody Contacts (proABC), a web server for predicting which residues of an antibody are involved in recognizing its cognate antigen.
It is based on a machine-learning method trained on sequence and sequence-derived features.
Starting from the antibody sequence alone, proABC estimates, for each residue in its sequence, the probability that it interacts with the cognate antigen.
Three different types of interaction are con- sidered and predicted separately (hydrogen bond, hydrophobic and other non-bonded interactions).
The results are displayed in an intuitive manner allowing an easy yet comprehensive exam- ination of the residues that could directly interact with the anti- gen (also known as specificity determining residues).
proABC also builds a 3D model of the antibody, in which residues are colored according to their contact probability.
The server is available at http://www.biocomputing.it/pro  ABC.
2 METHODS  2.1 Datasets The two datasets used for training and testing the predictors contain 313 and 44 antibody-antigen complexes, respectively.
We scanned the se- quences of all the molecules contained in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database (October 15, 2012) using isotype-specific Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles developed by us (Chailyan et al., 2012) and found 1294 antibody molecules.
Using the PISCES web server (Wang and Dunbrack, 2003), we removed all the structures with a resolution worse than 3 A  , ending up with 1139 molecules.
Among them, we selected all the immunoglobulins solved in complex with the antigen.
This step was performed by examining whether any atom not belonging to the immunoglobulin light or heavy chain falls within a 10 A  radius from the ABS barycenter.
When such atoms were found, the antibody was labeled as  bound , and all the chains to which these atoms belong were considered as  antigens .
Cases where non-immunoglobulin atoms were present near the binding site but were not labeled with a different chain identifier (usually small molecules) were manually examined to define the antigen/hapten.
Of the initial set of 1139 immunoglobulin structures, 637 were found to be in a bound state.
We removed all complexes where the immunoglobu- lin sequence shared a sequence identity higher than 95% with any other using the cd-hit software (Li and Godzik, 2006), and ended up with 313 antibody structures.
This dataset (hereafter called  RF dataset ) was used for the cross-validated training of the predictors.
To make an unbiased comparison of our results with those of Paratome, we also trained a predictor using a dataset obtained from the RF dataset after removing all the complexes in which the antibody sequence shares495% sequence identity with antibodies deposited in the PDB database after February 2011.
The antibodies released between February 2011 and October 2012 were collected in a third dataset (here- after called  Validation dataset ) and culled to remove redundancy both within the dataset and with the other datasets.
2286  Interaction identification  2.2 We calculated non-bonded contacts, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions for all the complexes using the software Ligplot (Wallace et al., 1995) with default parameters.
We also categorized these three groups of interactions according to which atoms of the residue (side chain and/or main chain) contact the antigen.
We obtained 18 different interaction tables containing the number of non-bonded contacts, h-bonds and hydrophobic interactions occurring between an antigen and a residue, its main chain alone and its side chain alone for both the heavy and the light chain.
We used each table to train a different predictor for every combination of interaction types (cont, h-bond, hydro), location of interaction (whole, main, side) and Ig chain (H, L).
2.3 Random forest analysis We aligned, following the Chothia numbering scheme, the heavy and the light chain sequences in the RF dataset using HMM profiles that we developed earlier (Chailyan et al., 2012).
For the H3 alignment, we fol- lowed the method described in Lefranc et al.
(2003) and Morea et al.
(1998).
The insertions were introduced at the center of the region com- prised between the conserved residue Cys92 and Gly104 (Cys104 and Gly119 according to the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT) numbering).
Each position of the heavy and the light chain multiple alignment was considered as a variable  therefore, we had 135 variables for the heavy chain and 125 variables for the light chain.
In other words, we predicted the binding properties of an amino acid (the target site) taking into account all the amino acids in the chains.
Each position can host one of the 20 amino acids or a gap, resulting in a 21-letter alphabet.
We adopted two different encodings for the amino acids.
The first strategy used the complete alphabet for all the variables (predictor A).
The second strategy (predictors B and C) used the complete alphabet only for the target site and a reduced alphabet for all other positions in the sequence.
The B and C strategies differ for the inclu- sion/exclusion of the antigen volume variable (see later in the text).
We chose a reduced alphabet based on the 11 amino acid classes described in Pommie et al.
(2004) and reported in Table 1.
In this 12-letter alphabet (11 amino acid classes and the gap symbol), specifically derived for im- munoglobulins, aromatic residues such as tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine as well as glycine and proline are considered as different classes.
This allows us to capture the pivotal role played by these amino acids both in antibody antigen recognition (Birtalan et al., 2008  Koide  Table 1.
The eleven classes used to encode amino acids in the reduced 12-letter alphabet adopted for models B and C  Cluster  Amino acid  Aliphatuc Sulfur Hydroxyl Acidic Basic Amide Phenylalanine Tryptophan Tyrosine Glycine Proline  Ala, Val, Ile, Leu Cys, Met Ser, Thr Asp, Glut His, Lys, Arg Asn Phe Trp Tyr Gly Pro   and Sidhu, 2009) and in maintenance of the ABS correct structural con- formation (North et al., 2011).
Table 2.
Random forest models  Prediction of site-specific interactions in antibody-antigen complexes  2.4 Antigen volume Several studies highlighted the correlation between antigen volume and the shape of the ABS (Collis et al., 2003  Lee et al., 2006).
Consequently, we also evaluated the contribution of antigen volume to the overall per- formance of our predictors.
We determined the antigen volumes using the 3 V software (Voss and Gerstein, 2010) and found that the distribution of the volumes of the antigens in our RF dataset is bimodal with a median value of 1538 A  3.
Complexes were classified in two categories depending on whether the antigen volume is larger or smaller than the median.
This variable was used in training predictors A and B.
2.5 Canonical structures and HV loop length Hypervariable loops and their main chain conformations (canonical structures) (Chothia and Lesk, 1987) are key parameters for antigen rec- ognition.
Five among the six loops (L1, L2, L3, H1, H2) adopt only few canonical structures, while the H3 loop is the most variable in both se- quence and structural conformation (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997  Morea et al., 1998).
We used the canonical structures and the HV loop length as variables.
These were obtained using the tools provided by the Digit database (Chailyan et al., 2012).
We decided to use these variables that implicitly take into account the 3D structure of the antibody, rather than the modeled structure itself to avoid biases arising from incorrect modeling of some parts of the mol- ecule, especially the H3 loop.
2.6 Germline families Germline heavy and light chain variable regions (VH and VL) gene germ- line genes have been extensively used to study the biophysical properties of different antibodies (Ewert et al., 2003) and for VH/VL packing pre- diction (Chailyan et al., 2011a, b).
We determined the source organism and the germline family and included them as variables in our predictors (Chailyan et al., 2012).
2.7 Random forest In this study, we applied the R (v.4.6) implementation of the Random Forest (randomForest package).
We built separate predictors for all the antibody positions that are in contact with the antigen in at least 10 of the 313 complexes in our dataset.
For all the other positions, the proABC output is simply the frequency with which the residue at that position interacts with the antigen in our dataset.
For each position, we generated 18 different predictors, taking into account the type of interaction (non-bonded contact, h-bond, hydro- phobic), the atoms involved in the interaction (whole residue, side chain and main chain) and the Ig heavy and the light chain.
Predictors were built in two-steps.
In the first step, we used all the variables reported in Table 2 and fed a forest of 1500 trees.
The total number of variables to be tested at each tree node (mtry) was set to its default value (corresponding to the square root of the total number of variables).
Mean decrease Gini (MDG) values resulting from this first step were ranked, and the average MDG was calculated (Chailyan et al., 2011a, b).
In the second step, we used only the features with an MDG value larger than average MDG and built 1500 trees with default mtry.
The entire process was subjected to a 10-fold cross-validation.
Three different models, named A, B and C (Table 2), were developed as described earlier in the text.
For comparison, we also built a predictor (naive predictor) trained on each position alone, independently of all the others, using the 21-letter alphabet and building 100 trees.

All predictors use the complete amino acid alphabet to encode the residue at the specific position for which the interaction is being predicted ( Position  column).
The complete alphabet is used in model A to encode the whole sequence, while the reduced 12-letter alphabet described in Table 1 is adopted in models B and C ( Sequence  column).
Models A, B and C share the same sequence-derived fea- tures (canonical structures, HV loop length and germline family).
The  Antigen Volume  binary variable, which labels antigens with a volume larger or smaller than 1538 A  3, is used only in models A and B.  the 10-fold cross-validation were evaluated using the following statistical measures: Precision, Accuracy, Recall, Matthew s correlation coefficient (MCC) and area under the curve (AUC).
2.8 Web interface The web interface to the server is implemented in php and Jquery.
Plots and tables are generated with the R package GoogleVis v.0.33 (Gesmann and de Castillo, 2011).
Images are generated with Pymol (DeLano, 2002).
3 RESULTS  3.1 Performance evaluation  We compared the results of the three predictors with those ob- tained using the naive predictor.
The corresponding ROC curves are shown in Figure 1, and the MCC and the AUC values for all the models are shown in Table 3.
In all cases, our models clearly outperform the naive predictor indicating that information on the whole antibody sequence effectively contributes to the pre- diction performance.
All predictors had similar values of AUC and MCC for non-bonded contacts, whereas model B proved to be better at predicting both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (See Supplementary Fig.
S1).
We obtained a slightly worse performance for main chain hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, possibly because of the small number of these interactions present in our dataset.
Despite the importance of antigen volume for the prediction of some specific positions (as discussed later), predictor C still has a good overall classification ability.
This gave us the possibility to include the antigen volume as an optional feature in the proABC web server, so that we use model B when the antigen volume is known and model C in all other cases.
3.2 Variable importance  As shown in the previous section, the predictors that use all the variables (sequence, antigen volume, canonical structures and germline families) greatly outperform the naÄ±  ve one that only takes into account the contact frequency and residue identity at the target site.
2287   P.P.Olimpieri et al.
Table 4 lists the 20 most important variables and their relative contribution to the correct prediction of the target site inter- actions.
Supplementary Table S1 includes the complete list of variables and their relative importance.
The analysis of the most important variables for specific target sites provides inter- esting insights into the antibody ABS and the process of antigen recognition.
The antigen volume, for instance, is critical to cor- rectly predict interactions with the N-terminals and C-terminals of the H1 and L1 loops, whereas residues in the center of these loops are influenced by the antigen volume to a significantly lower extent.
These findings agree with a recently published ana- lysis of the ABS anatomy (Raghunathan et al., 2012).
It has been noticed (Collis et al., 2003) that the H3 loop packs with L1 in the ABS reducing the accessibility of its C-terminal residues.
Our data support this observation, as we observe a correlation between the H3 length and the number of contacts in the C-terminal region of L1, the shorter the loop, the (CL1Â¼  0.06H3LenÃ¾ 1.61, higher PÂ¼ 2.16  10   5, Pearson correlation coefficientÂ¼ 0.24).

Non-bonded contact prediction ROC curves for models A,B and C and the naive predictor  3.3 Comparison with other methods  To the best of our knowledge, proABC is unique in its purpose.
The most similar tool is Paratome (Kunik et al., 2012), an online tool for antigen-binding region identification.
The performance of the two algorithms is evaluated here using the independent validation set described in Methods section.
The results are sum- marized in Table 5.
Paratome shows a very high total recall at the expense of low precision and specificity.
This can be ex- plained considering the threshold that Paratome uses to define contacts (6.0 A  cut-off).
This choice is due to the fact that Paratome aims at defining a plausible region of antigen binding rather than at predicting residue-specific inter- actions.
On the other hand, proABC, despite its lower recall, outperforms Paratome in terms of precision and specificity.
The MCC of the two methods shows that, overall, proABC per- forms significantly better.
somewhat  large  3.4 Web server interface and 3D model  We integrated our predictors and several other tools, including a routine to build a 3D model of the antibody (Marcatili et al., 2008), in a web server with a user-friendly interface (http://www.
biocomputing.it/proABC).
The web server includes six different pages: (i) Home  (ii) Plot  (iii) Summary  (iv) High Quality (HQ) figures  (v) Structure  and (vi) Logs.
The main page allows the user to input the light and the heavy chain sequences and, optionally, the antigen volume.
The input is pre-processed to obtain all the information that can be derived from the sequence, namely germline families, canonical structures and length of each HV loop, shown in the Summary page, and passed to the relevant predictor.
The web server uses predictor B (that has the best overall performance) if the user provides infor- mation on the antigen volume (smaller or larger than 1538 A  3), and predictor C if no information on the antigen volume is given.
The Plot page reports the results as graphs/tables listing the prob- ability of each residue to interact with the antigen.
The Summary page also includes links to download the results and the 3D model.
The Image and Structure tabs allow the users to visu- alize the antibody 3D model and high-quality images of the anti- body in which residues are colored according to their contact  Table 3.

The Log page shows the current job status, indicating which operations are being performed.
Figure 3 shows an example of application of the server.
The selected case is that of the humanized antibody Gevokizumab, the crystal structure of which (both free and in complex with its antigen interleukin-1 beta) has been recently solved  Fig.
2.
Three-dimensional model generated by the proABC server for Gevokizumab.
Residues are colored according to their predicted contact probabilities (light gray to blue gradient for the light chain, dark gray to purple gradient for the heavy chain)  (Blech et al., 2013), but was obviously not used for the prediction.
None of the antibodies in our dataset shares 475% sequence identity with Gevokizumab.
Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S2 show the probabilities assigned by proABC to residues in the Gevokizumab light and heavy chain sequences and highlights the correct and incorrect predictions obtained in this example (con- sidering a residue as predicted to be in contact if the correspond- ing probability is 40.5).
As can be seen, most of the predictions are correct.
proABC predicts a marginal role for the H1 loop and a prominent role of H2 in antigen recognition.
Interestingly, the L3 loop is predicted to be the most important light chain region for antigen binding, with four contacts and two rarely observed main chain hydrogen bonds.
This is what is observed in the crys- tal structure of the complex.
On the other hand, two contacts in L1 (position 27 and 28) were not predicted with high probability in this case.
These two residues are rarely observed to be in contact with the antigen (13 and 18 cases in our dataset, respectively) and therefore are very difficult to classify correctly, highlighting the importance of increasing the number of solved structures of antibody com- plexes to further improve the performance of our method.
4 CONCLUSIONS  In this article, we described a method for predicting the prob- ability of site-specific interactions between an antibody and its cognate antigen that reaches specificity and recall values of the order of 80%.
This implies that the predictions are sufficiently accurate not only for investigating the properties of specific anti- bodies, but also as input for the design of novel antibodies, for example, in affinity maturation projects, and as a guidance for docking methods if the structure of the antigen is known or can be modeled.
Interestingly, our data show that the prediction accuracy im- proves when the complete sequence of the antibody rather than  2289   P.P.Olimpieri et al.

The results of the proABC server on the sequence of the humanized antibody Gevokizumab are compared with the experimentally observed interactions computed using Ligplot on the solved structure of the antibody in complex with its cognate antigen (PDB code:: 4G6M).
The plots report the non-bonded contact probability for each residue and, separately, for its side chain and its main chain.
The same information is reported in a tabular form as well.
False positive predictions were made for H:100, H:95, H:50 (all and side) and H:96 (all and main), false negative predictions for H:32, L:50, L:53, L:28, L:27 (all, side), H:57 (all, main) and H:58 (main) while the other predictions shown in Fig.3 are all true positives.
Each residue for which proABC returns an interaction probability higher than 0.5 is considered as a predicted contact  that of its binding site alone is taken into account.
We could also derive information about which position/features of the antibody sequence influence the participation to the binding interface of specific sites, thus permitting a detailed structural analysis of the complex interplay between the framework and ABS in determin- ing the specificity of the interaction, an issue of interest from both a theoretical and practical point of view.
The main advantages of the method presented here are that (i) it relies only on the sequence of the variable fragment of the antibody of interest, (ii) it is able to take into account the size of the antigen when the information is available and (iii) it can be automatically updated as new data on the structure of antibody complexes become available.
The associated server is straightforward to use and provides publication-ready output images as well as information on the properties of the analyzed immunoglobulin, including the determination of the corresponding germline family and the canonical structures and length of each HV loop.
It also permits the user to obtain a model of the 3D structure of the antibody quickly and easily by using a well-tested and very accurate method (Marcatili, et al., 2008).
The server (http://www.
biocomputing.it/proABC) is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement.
