Obesity is a significant risk factor for developing osteoarthritis in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing
joints. Although the pathogenesis of obesity-associated osteoarthritis is not completely understood, recent
studies indicate that pro-inflammatory metabolic factors contribute to an increase in osteoarthritis risk.
Adipose tissue, and in particular infrapatellar fat, is a local source of pro-inflammatory mediators that are
increased with obesity and have been shown to increase cartilage degradation in cell and tissue culture models.
One adipokine in particular, leptin, may be a critical mediator of obesity-associated osteoarthritis via
synergistic actions with other inflammatory cytokines. Biomechanical factors may also increase the risk
of osteoarthritis by activating cellular inflammation and promoting oxidative stress. However, some types
of biomechanical stimulation, such as physiologic cyclic loading, inhibit inflammation and protect against
cartilage degradation. A high percentage of obese individuals with knee osteoarthritis are sedentary, sug-
gesting that a lack of physical activity may increase the susceptibility to inflammation. A more comprehensive
approach to understanding how obesity alters daily biomechanical exposures within joint tissues may provide
new insight into the protective and damaging effects of biomechanical factors on inflammation in
osteoarthritis.

Osteoarthritis is a painful diarthrodial joint disease

that develops as a result of an insufficient and
often aberrant repair of damaged synovial joint
tissue. Common features of osteoarthritis include pro-
gressive focal lesions in the articular cartilage, abnormal
bone remodeling, meniscal tears, mild synovitis, and
muscle weakness. Aging is the primary predictor of
osteoarthritis, with most people older than 70 years of
age showing some signs of disease in at least one joint (1).
The etiology of aging-associated osteoarthritis is not well
understood, although cellular senescence may contribute
to disease pathology. Many of the pro-inflammatory
mediators and proteases attributed to a senescence-
associated secretory phenotype in fibroblasts, such as
Interluekin-1b (IL-1b), IL-6, IL-8, matrix metalloprotei-
nase 3 (MMP-3), and MMP-13, are commonly increased
in osteoarthritic tissues (2,3). These pro-inflammatory
mediators, along with nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2,

promote an imbalance in the synthesis and degradation
of
the cartilage extracellular matrix that eventually
lead to cartilage degradation (4). Identifying the age-
associated changes in chondrocyte biology that promote
the cellular senescence phenotype is an active area of
research, with current studies indicating a role for DNA
damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and
cellular stress protective mechanisms (3).

The extent to which circulating inflammatory factors
contribute to osteoarthritis pathology is uncertain. Syno-
vial fluid and serum inflammatory cytokines, such as
IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-a (TNF-a),
are elevated in osteoarthritis patient cohorts and animal
models, suggesting that systemic inflammation initiates
osteoarthritis pathology (5). A recent study provided
additional evidence linking systemic inflammation and
osteoarthritis, but from a different point of view. Rather
than focusing on factors associated with the presence

of osteoarthritis, the authors investigated inflammatory
factors associated with the absence of osteoarthritis in
an aged cohort. When older adults with and without
osteoarthritis were compared, those individuals without
osteoarthritis showed a reduced production of IL-1b and
IL-6 in whole blood samples stimulated with lipopoly-
saccharide (6). Thus, resistance to a systemic inflamma-
tory stress may protect against osteoarthritis. Recent
genetic studies of inflammatory marker polymorphisms
and knee osteoarthritis indicate that IL-1 receptor anta-
gonist (IL-1Ra) gene polymorphisms may be associated
with differences in the severity of age-dependent knee
osteoarthritis (7). The ability of inflammatory genetic
markers or other systemic inflammatory mediators to
predict osteoarthritis risk remains an important area of
investigation, especially in the study of obesity-associated
osteoarthritis.

Obesity and inflammation in osteoarthritis
Obesity is one of the most significant preventable risk
factors for developing knee osteoarthritis (8). One way in
which obesity may increase the risk of osteoarthritis
is by altering knee joint loading patterns, such as occurs
with varus/valgus laxity and knee joint malalignment
(9,10). However, mechanical factors alone do not seem
to be sufficient
to explain the relationship between
osteoarthritis incidence and obesity (11,12). Obesity
also increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis in
non-weight-bearing joints such as the hand, and several
recent studies, summarized below, suggest that systemic
inflammatory mediators contribute to the increased risk
of osteoarthritis with obesity. Adipose tissue, especially
from the abdomen, is a rich source of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, which are often referred to as adipokines.
Many of
the adipokines elevated with obesity and
metabolic syndrome have also been shown to mediate
synovial tissue inflammation and upregulate cartilage
matrix synthesis and degradation (5,13). In a recent
study, cardiometabolic disease clustering increased the
risk of osteoarthritis even when controlling for BMI
(14), suggesting that a common set of metabolic factors
underlie both cardiovascular and osteoarthritis disease
conditions. Osteoarthritis,
like cardiovascular disease,
involves altered lipid metabolism coupled with increased
systemic and cellular expression of pro-inflammatory
mediators (15,16). Establishing a causal relationship
between osteoarthritis and metabolic inflammation is
difficult because both factors are correlated with changes
in joint loading biomechanics that occur with obesity.
Nevertheless, a growing number of studies, although
not all (17), support a role for metabolic factors in
osteoarthritis (3,11,15,1823).

One of the central mediators being investigated for a
potential metabolic-osteoarthritis link is leptin. Leptin is
a 16-kd polypeptide hormone encoded by the obese (ob)

gene (24). Leptin is primarily secreted by adipocytes,
functioning as an afferent signal
in a hypothalamic
negative-feedback loop to regulate adipose tissue mass
and body weight. We have previously reported that
female mice with impaired leptin signaling are protected
from obesity-induced osteoarthritis (19). These findings
indicate that elevated body fat in the absence of leptin
signaling is insufficient to induce systemic inflammation
and osteoarthritis in C57BL/6J mice. Moreover,
in a
45-week diet-induced obesity study in female C57BL/6J
mice, we found that serum leptin concentrations pre-
dicted knee osteoarthritis severity even when statistically
controlling for the effect of diet and percentage body
fat (18).

The extent to which leptin mediates the onset versus
the progression of osteoarthritis is uncertain. The pri-
mary pro-inflammatory and catabolic effects of leptin in
chondrocytes occur through co-stimulation with other
inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1, TNF-a, and IFN-g
(21,25). Furthermore, there is some evidence that tissue
disease status and patient BMI are important determi-
nants of leptin-mediated cartilage degeneration. We pre-
viously showed that physiologic doses of leptin were not
sufficient to induce or synergistically increase cartilage
nitric oxide production or proteoglycan release in healthy
porcine cartilage explants (18). Moreover, when osteoar-
thritic chondrocytes are obtained from patients with a
range of body mass indexes, MMP13 gene expression was
only altered by physiologic concentrations of leptin in
cells from obese patients (23). It is not known if leptin
receptor expression is increased in chondrocytes from
obese patients independent from osteoarthritis disease
status (26). As leptin has also been shown to increase the
expression of anabolic growth factors, such as IGF-1 and
TGF-b (27), increased sensitivity to leptin within osteoar-
thritic cells appears to mediate an overall increase in
cartilage extracellular matrix turnover, a characteristic of
early to middle stages of disease.

is sufficient

Recent studies indicate a potentially important role
for the infrapatellar fat pad in mediating intra-articular
knee inflammation (21,2831). In particular, Hui et al.
(21) used conditioned medium from ex vivo cultures
of infrapatellar fat to show that leptin secretion from
infrapatellar fat
to induce MMP1 and
MMP13 gene expression in osteoarthritic chondrocytes.
Leptin is unique among other adipokines analyzed to date
in that only leptin has been found to exist at higher
concentrations in the synovial fluid compared to serum,
suggesting an important role for infrapatellar fat in intra-
articular leptin production (32). Moreover, the infra-
patellar fat pad also secretes IL-6, adiponectin, and
visfatin at greater levels than subcutaneous fat in ex vivo
culture (31). An important question that remains to be
addressed is to what extent cartilage and synovial inflam-
mation drive infrapatellar fat inflammation. Most studies

investigating inflammation in the infrapatellar fat pad
harvest fat tissue from severely osteoarthritic joints during
joint replacement surgery. Bastiaansen-Jenniskens et al.
(28) reported increased levels of
immuno-regulatory
CD206 macrophages in infrapatellar fat harvested
from osteoarthritic joints compared to joints undergoing
ACL repair. The increased population of
immuno-
regulatory macrophages may explain the unexpected
finding that infrapatellar fat-conditioned media from
osteoarthritic joints inhibits the function of catabolic
mediators in healthy cartilage (28). Future studies are
needed to characterize the inflammatory phenotype of
infrapatellar fat pads prior to the development of osteo-
arthritis. Testing this question in lean and obese animal
models may provide much needed insight into the role of
infrapatellar fat and inflammation in obesity-associated
osteoarthritis.

Biomechanical modulation of cartilage
inflammation
Numerous factors, such as physical activity levels, body
weight, and skeletal anatomy, affect the range of mechan-
ical forces acting on synovial joint tissues. Mechanical
signals are not only generally well-tolerated by cells
embedded within load-bearing tissues such as articular
cartilage, they are essential for normal function and
maintenance of the extracellular matrix (33). Cartilage is
subjected to mechanical forces in the form of compres-
sion, shear stress, and hydrostatic pressure (34). These
mechanical signals are sensed by chondrocytes and
activate signaling pathways that promote tissue home-
ostasis by balancing the production of anabolic growth
factors and catabolic
cytokines and inflammatory
mediators, including IGF-1, TGF-b, IL-10, IL-1, IL-6,
TNF-a, prostaglandin E2, and nitric oxide (33,35). Pro-
inflammatory mediators are highly expressed under
conditions of acute or chronic high intensity loading
(12,36,37). These catabolic loads also significantly in-
crease the production of reactive oxygen species, which
stimulate a pro-oxidative cellular environment leading to
proteolytic enzyme activation and matrix degradation
(38,39). Understanding how different forms, magnitudes,
and frequencies of mechanical stimulation activate pro-
anabolic and pro-catabolic pathways may lead to new
biomechanical-based therapeutic approaches for treating
obesity-associated osteoarthritis.

Anti-inflammatory mechanisms
Exercise is generally considered anti-inflammatory and
therefore may be an important treatment for reducing
osteoarthritis risk, especially in obese individuals with
metabolic inflammation (40). However, current evidence
on how increased physical activity affects the risk of
developing osteoarthritis in obese individuals is incon-
clusive, perhaps due to the reliance on self-report recall

Integrating biomechanics and inflammation

of physical activity. Therefore, we sought to study the
interaction of obesity and exercise on the development of
osteoarthritis using an animal model (20). After 4 weeks
of feeding mice a very high-fat diet, mice were divided into
exercise and sedentary groups for an additional 4 weeks.
We found that voluntary wheel running was protective or
neutral rather than damaging, indicating that increased
joint loading per se is not sufficient to explain the
increased incidence of knee osteoarthritis in diet-induced
obese mice. Furthermore, exercise improved glucose
tolerance and disrupted the co-expression of systemic
pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both lean and obese mice
responded to the exercise stimulus with an adaptive
increase in heart mass relative to lean tissue mass and
without any change in body mass or percent body fat.
Thus, like the benefits of being ‘fit and fat’ rather than
‘thin and sedentary’ for cardiovascular disease (41), these
findings suggest that increased aerobic exercise may act
independent of weight loss in promoting joint health.

Exercise may also be protective against inflammation
and matrix catabolism through direct biomechanical
stimulation of articular cartilage. In a rabbit model of
antigen-induced arthritis, cyclic passive joint motion
reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators
IL-1b and cyclooxygenase-2 and increased the expression
of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (42,43). Addi-
tional work by Agarwal et al. has shown that NF-kB is a
critical mechano-sensitive transcription factor that can
either be inhibited or activated depending on the type of
biomechanical stimulation. Cyclic biomechanical loading
suppresses NF-kB activation and down-regulates IL-1a
and TNF-a dependent gene transcription (44,45). Cyclic
loading also reduces the expression of inflammatory-
induced cartilage catabolic mediators, matrix metallo-
proteinases and aggrecanases, as well as cartilage matrix
degradation (4448). In contrast, static and high-strain
loads activate NF-kB signaling and downstream inflam-
matory mediators,
including inducible nitric oxide
synthase, prostaglandin E2, reactive oxygen species, and
pro-inflammatory cytokines
(34,43,49,50). Damaging
biomechanical
loads also lead to cellular ATP deple-
tion (51,52) and apoptosis (53). Thus, identifying how
different magnitudes, durations, and frequencies of
mechanical stimulation regulate the transition between
anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory mechanisms is
critical
for understanding disease pathogenesis and
developing effective therapeutic targets.

Redox regulation
As with obesity, a central cellular characteristic of
osteoarthritis is an increase in the production of reactive
oxygen species, cellular oxidation (35,54), and apoptosis
(55,56). Maintaining oxidative homeostasis requires a
sufficient activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes,
such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and

glutathione, which appear to be impaired with aging
(5759). Biomechanical stress resulting from injurious
or static loads can also be a source of pro-oxidant stress
in chondrocytes by inducing the production of reactive
oxygen species (60). Superoxide anion is thought to be the
primary reactive oxygen species that is biomechanically
induced through the activation of NADPH oxidase
or mitochondrial stress (61,62). Superoxide anion is not
stable and is readily transformed to hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) by SOD. H2O2
inhibits protein and DNA
synthesis in cartilage tissue through the depletion of
ATP (63). Supplementing chondrocytes with antioxidants
prior to stressful loading can protect against cell death
and matrix degradation, suggesting that biomechanically-
induced oxidative stress could be reduced with an
increase in endogenous antioxidant activities (39,6466).
In fact, treatment with low repetitive doses of H2O2
preconditions cartilage against biomechanical stress (67).
Cyclic biomechanical loading may precondition carti-
lage with a regulated production of pro-oxidants leading
to enhanced antioxidant activities and improved cellular
redox control. Low to moderate levels of pro-oxidants
act as signaling mediators in pathways involving tran-
scriptional regulation of cytokines, proteinases, adhesion
molecules, and extracellular matrix components (6870).
One potential mechanism for biomechanically-induced
upregulation of endogenous antioxidant capacity is
through stabilization of the transcription factor NF-E2-
related factor-2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 protects cells and tissues
from oxidative stress by activating a family of antioxidant
proteins containing the antioxidant responsive element
enhancer sequence (71). Enhanced antioxidant capacity
would improve cellular redox regulation and may also
explain how cyclic biomechanical loading downregulates
the NF-kB signaling pathway, which involves several
redox-sensitive signaling elements. Thus, the regulated
production of reactive oxygen species via physiologic
stimulation may increase endogenous
biomechanical
anti-oxidant capacity,
thereby providing an adaptive
response that may protect against joint inflammation
and cellular oxidative stress (72,73).

Conclusion

Obesity andosteoarthritis:treatment challenges and
opportunities
Inflammation is a central component of a progressive
disease cycle involving obesity, osteoarthritis, and physi-
cal inactivity (Fig. 1). Metabolic inflammation associated
with obesity is believed to exacerbate the condition by
contributing to metabolic inflexibility and the sustained
production of pro-inflammatory mediators (74). Meta-
bolic inflammation also appears to increase osteoarthritis
risk, although the mechanisms for this association are
not yet well understood. Several recent studies suggest

Fig. 1. Progressive relationship among obesity, osteoarthritis,
and physical inactivity. Obesity is an independent risk factor
for osteoarthritis. The mechanisms responsible for this link are
not completely understood but are thought to involve altered
biomechanical loading and metabolic inﬂammation associated
with excess adipose tissue and lipids. Osteoarthritis pain in-
creases sedentary behavior and is associated with psychosocial
and physical disability. Physical inactivity is an independent
risk factor for inﬂammation due to the reduced expression of
systemic and cellular anti-inﬂammatory mediators. Physiologic
cyclic loading of cartilage tissue has been shown to reduce
the expression of pro-inﬂammatory mediators and decrease
cytokine-induced extracellular matrix degradation. Physical
inactivity reduces daily energy expenditure thereby promoting
weight gain and continuation of the cycle. Emerging evidence
indicates that osteoarthritis likely impedes the management of
chronic metabolic diseases associated with aging, such as
obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, because of its negative
impact on physical activity.

that metabolic inflammation and hyperlipidemia increase
the susceptibility of chondrocytes to biomechanically-
induced cellular stress, as occurs following joint injury
(11,22). Cyclic physiologic loading of the limbs, as occurs
with a physically active lifestyle and exercise,
is an
effective means of reducing inflammation systemically
as well as locally in adipose tissue and cartilage. Obesity is
in part attributed to a reduction in physical activity levels,
and recent studies indicate that knee osteoarthritis greatly
exacerbates this problem. Approximately 10% of obese
adults with knee osteoarthritis meet the recommended
levels of daily physical activity and nearly 50% are
physically inactive, with no moderate-to-vigorous activity
]10 min during the previous week (75). These and other
data indicate that osteoarthritis is a major barrier to
being physically active (76). Physical
like
obesity,
is considered an independent risk factor for
inflammation (77). Thus, a decrease in regular joint
loading may increase the susceptibility of joint tissues
to inflammatory stress. An important challenge for the
future is to integrate quantitative measures of systemic
and local
inflammation with biomechanical exposure
data. Does obesity cause local knee inflammation by
altering load distribution and increasing joint stress?
Or does a lack of regular cyclic joint loading increase
metabolic inflammation and the susceptibility of synovial

inactivity,

joint tissues to cellular oxidative stress and extracellular
matrix degradation? The answers to these questions
are not mutually exclusive, and they highlight the chal-
lenges ahead to understand the pathogenesis of obesity-
associated osteoarthritis.
