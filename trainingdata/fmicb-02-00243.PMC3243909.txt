This mini-review article is dedicated to clarifying certain important biochemical aspects
of Sporothrix schenckii cell wall peptidorhamnomannans. Cell wall components involved
in the host interaction such as antigens as well as a gp70 adhesin are important mole-
cules present on the surface of the yeast parasitic phase. Other structural glycoconjugates
present on the fungus cell surface are also described here. Knowledge of the ﬁne struc-
ture of carbohydrate epitopes expressed on the surface in both morphological phases
of S. schenckii permitted the development of non-invasive immunochemical methods to
diagnose human and feline sporotrichosis.

GENERAL ASPECTS OF S. SCHENCKII
Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis caused by the dimorphic
fungus Sporothrix schenckii. This disease has several clinical forms
and, until now, no clear scientiﬁc evidence can explain the occur-
rence of cutaneous disseminated and/or extracutaneous forms of
sporotrichosis in immunocompetent patients (Lima Barros et al.,
2003; Schubach et al., 2008). These clinical observations indicate
that besides the immunological background of the host, other
factors associated with the pathogen can impair the clinical man-
ifestations of this disease, such as virulence factors (i.e., adhesins)
and antigenic molecules. Some of these factors of S. schenckii will
be brieﬂy discussed in this review article, focusing on the fungus
surface.

Another important feature that should be highlighted is the
recent description of several genotypes indicating that S. schenckii
is a complex of cryptic species, denominated the S. schenckii com-
plex (Marimon et al., 2006, 2007). Within this complex, at least ﬁve
species are considered of interest due to their pathogenic potential
(Arrillaga-Moncrieff et al., 2009). Among these, S. globosa have
already been associated with human cases (Oliveira et al., 2010)
and S. brasiliensis with feline sporotrichosis (Lopes-Bezerra L. M.,
unpublished results) in Brazil. The genome project of two path-
ogenic species, S. schenckii and S. brasiliensis, are currently under
development (Felipe M. S. and Lopes-Bezerra L. M., personal
communication) and will bring new insights regarding virulence
factors and other relevant biological aspects of these two path-
ogenic species, which can be further associated with noteworthy
clinical and epidemiological aspects of sporotrichosis.

Subcutaneous fungal infections are usually chronic conditions.
They often begin after the skin has been pierced following an
injury of some kind, since this allows infectious fungi to pene-
trate the skin and establish themselves inside the host. Eventually,
a subcutaneous infection like sporotrichosis can evolve to severe
systemic or disseminated forms. In this rather complicated puzzle,

the ﬁrst step for a pathogen to succeed is its capacity to adhere
to and colonize host tissues. The binding of pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) as cell wall sugar polymers and pro-
teins, to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on innate immune
cells triggers the activation of the immune system (Bourgeois et al.,
2010; Latgé, 2010). Additionally, adhesion molecules expressed on
the fungus cell surface can mediate their interaction with host cells
and extracellular matrix components (Tronchin et al., 2008).

One of the well known cell wall components of S. schenckii
is the peptidorhamnomannan. This glycopeptide or glycoconju-
gate is a complex of molecules with a wide range of molecular
weights that are hard to purify as individual components (Lima
and Lopes-Bezerra, 1997). This cell wall peptidorhamnomannan
fraction (CWPR) can be recognized by IgG antibodies present in
patient sera (Lloyd and Bitoon, 1971; Penha and Lopes-Bezerra,
2000) and by host cell receptors and matricial proteins (Lima et al.,
2001; Figueiredo et al., 2004). Another interesting cell wall compo-
nent, also present in the fungus culture ﬁltrate, is a 70-kDa antigen
(Lima and Lopes-Bezerra, 1997; Nascimento and Almeida, 2005).
Furthermore, several groups have reported evidence of the role
of gp70 as an important adhesin that can mediate fungus adhe-
sion to host tissues and to matricial proteins of the basal lamina
(López-Romero et al., 2011).

CELL WALL GLYCOCONJUGATES
Sporothrix schenckii has two morphological phases: a mycelial
saprophytic form and a parasitic yeast-like form. Alkali-soluble
and -insoluble glucans were detected in both morphological
phases of this fungus. Alkali-soluble glucans of the yeast form
of S. schenckii are linked by β(1,3), β(1,6), and β(1,4) bonds at 44,
28, and 28%, respectively. Insoluble glucans contain 66, 29, and
5%, respectively, of β(1,3), β(1,6), and β(1,4) bonds. No variations
in β-glucan composition were correlated with the fungus mor-
phological transition (Previato et al., 1979). Furthermore, there

S. schenckii cell wall

is no evidence in the literature concerning the presence of an α-
glucan on the fungus surface, similar to that described for other
dimorphic fungi.

The cell wall peptidorhamnomannan is composed of 33.5%
rhamnose, 57% mannose, and 14.2% protein and was character-
ized in the yeast-phase of S. schenckii (Lloyd and Bitoon, 1971). In
addition to rhamnose and mannose, polysaccharides containing
galactose have also been identiﬁed on the surface of this fun-
gus. A similar component containing rhamnose and mannose
was detected in a fraction isolated from the culture ﬁltrate of S.
schenckii (Ishizaki, 1970). This culture ﬁltrate glycopeptide was
also shown to be antigenic and its antigenicity varied according
to the rhamnose:mannose molar ratio, which is inﬂuenced by the
culture conditions (Takata and Ishizaki, 1983).

Another intriguing ﬁnding was the observation that S. schenckii
peptidorhamnomannans reacted with the carbohydrate-binding
protein Concanavalin A (lectin ConA), but the rhamnomannans
extracted by hot alkali treatment was non-reactive (Travassos et al.,
1977). These ﬁndings did not conﬁrm the preliminary struc-
tural evidence indicating the presence of mannose residues at
non-reducing ends of the carbohydrate moiety of peptidorham-
nomannan (Lloyd and Bitoon, 1971). Further biochemical studies
veriﬁed that ConA reactivity was associated with the presence of
O-glycosidically linked chains in the CWPR structure (Lopes-
Alves et al., 1992). The O-linked oligosaccharides had a com-
mon internal core of α-d-Man 1→ 2 α-d-Man (illustrated in
Figure 1) and the 2-O substituted mannose residue was identiﬁed
as the lectin binding domain present on the fungus cell surface

FIGURE 1 | (A,B) Schematic representation showing the general structure
of the main antigenic epitopes and ConA-binding sites described on the cell
wall peptidorhamonomannan of both the yeast (Y) and mycelial (M) phases
of S. schenckii.

(Lopes-Alves et al., 1992). Immunocytochemical analysis of anti-
gens in the outermost layer of yeast cells of S. schenckii revealed
labeling of these antigens by polyclonal antibodies colocalized with
regions reactive with ConA (Castillo et al., 1990).

The peptidorhamnomannan fraction described by Lloyd and
Bitoon (1971) reacted with sera from patients with sporotri-
chosis. The main carbohydrate epitopes identiﬁed in the N -
and O-glycosidically linked chains of CWPR are illustrated in
Figures 1A,B. In addition, an enriched glycopeptide cell wall frac-
tion inhibited the adhesion of the yeast-phase of S. schenckii to
extracellular matrix proteins, suggesting the presence of adhesins
on the surface of this pathogen (Lima et al., 2001, 2004). In addi-
tion to rhamnose and mannose, polysaccharides containing galac-
tose have been identiﬁed on the surface of this fungus, suggesting
the presence of a cell wall galactomannan (Mendonça et al., 1976;
Mendonça-Previato et al., 1980). A peptidorhamnogalactan has
previously been isolated from yeast-like cells (Nakamura, 1976).
Glucuronic acid residues have been described in an acidic frac-
tion of rhamnomannans from S. schenckii (Gorin et al., 1977). In
addition, the O-glycosidic chains showed important antigen deter-
minants involving α-d-glucuronic acid residues mono- and disub-
stituted by terminal non-reducing rhamnose residues (Figure 1A;
Lopes-Alves et al., 1994).

Interestingly, a structurally similar cell surface peptidorhamno-
mannan was described in the pathogenic fungus Pseudallescheria
boydii and, this peptidopolysaccharide also presented O-linked
chains (Pinto et al., 2005). Similarly to S. schenckii, the rhamnose
containing structures appear to be immunodominant epitopes.

S. SCHENCKII ANTIGENS
Antigens isolated from both the culture ﬁltrate and the cell wall
have been used for intradermal tests in guinea pigs and humans
(Nielsen, 1968). Sporotrichin tests, however, have yielded false-
positive results in individuals with no history of sporotrichosis
(Schneidau et al., 1964). Furthermore, antigens isolated from the
culture ﬁltrate are highly heterogeneous (Takata and Ishizaki,
1983).

Since the cell wall is the surface structure of the fungal cell
and therefore mediates the relation with the host, it represents
an important source of antigens. Several studies have been con-
ducted with the objective of isolating and identifying antigens
on the cell wall of S. schenckii. The evidence that the O-linked
tetra- and pentasaccharides carry important antigenic epitopes

S. schenckii cell wall

α-d-GlcAp (Figure 1), which had not been described in other
species, suggested that they could be used as potential markers
for serodiagnosis (Lopes-Alves et al., 1994). Using the recogni-
tion and binding capacity of these CWPR O-glycosidic chains
to the lectin ConA, Lima and Lopes-Bezerra (1997) puriﬁed a
cell wall ConA-binding fraction, called SsCBF (S. schenckii ConA-
binding fraction). In ELISA assays using human sera (gold stan-
dard), this antigenic fraction was recognized by IgG antibodies
present in the sera of patients with all clinical forms of sporotri-
chosis (Bernardes-Engemann et al., 2005) and this recognition
was speciﬁcally blocked by the puriﬁed O-linked tetra- and pen-
tasaccharides (Penha and Lopes-Bezerra, 2000). This serological
test has also been useful for therapeutic follow-up of patients
(Bernardes-Engemann et al., 2005). Another serological ELISA test
was proposed in the literature (Almeida-Paes et al., 2007), based on
a culture ﬁltrate antigenic preparation. The ELISA tests described
in the current literature showed values of speciﬁcity and sensibility
ranging from 80 to 95%. Another recent study conﬁrmed that the
SsCBF antigen could also be useful for the serodiagnosis of feline
sporotrichosis (Fernandes et al., 2011).

In conclusion, non-invasive diagnostic tools are available to
promptly diagnose not only the classic lymphocutaneous or ﬁxed
cutaneous forms of sporotrichosis, but also the disseminated and
atypical forms of this disease or unresolved cases that are negative
according to the routine mycological test.

S. SCHENCKII gp70
In the cell wall SsCBF antigenic fraction three main antigens
with approximate molecular weights of 84 (gp84), 70 (gp70), and
58 kDa which reacted with a rabbit anti-S. schenckii serum were
identiﬁed (Lima and Lopes-Bezerra, 1997). 2D-immunoblotting
with anti-S. schenckii antibodies had shown that a 70-kDa

glycoprotein was the major antigen detected in the cell wall of
the mycelial and the yeast-like phases of S. schenckii and, a 60-kDa
antigenic glycoprotein was present only on the surface of yeast-like
cells (Ruiz-Baca et al., 2011).

Further studies had shown that sera from mice infected with
S. schenckii had IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies reacting with a gp70
antigenic component present in the fungus culture ﬁltrate (Nasci-
mento and Almeida, 2005). A monoclonal antibody was raised
against the secreted gp70 antigen, mAb P6E7. This monoclonal
antibody had a protective effect in vivo by passive immunization of
mice infected with S. schenckii (Nascimento et al., 2008). Besides,
the secreted gp70 antigen was also shown to be expressed on the
cell wall of the yeast-like phase of several clinical isolates of S.
schenckii (Teixeira et al., 2009). This antigenic glycoprotein seems
to have other important functions. There is strong evidence for its
role as an adhesin which mediates S. schenckii interaction with the
extracellular matrix protein ﬁbronectin and also, adhesion of this
fungus to the dermis of mouse tails (Ruiz-Baca et al., 2009; Teix-
eira et al., 2009). The co-localization on the yeast cell surface of
a ﬁbronectin adhesin and the mAb P6E7 antibody was conﬁrmed
by confocal microscopy, suggesting that the gp70 exoantigen and
the cell wall protein with apparent MW of 70 kDa are similar
components (Teixeira et al., 2009).

The puriﬁed gp70 exhibited a pI of 4.1 and about 5.7% of
its molecular mass was contributed by N -linked glycans with no
evidence for O-linked oligosaccharides (Ruiz-Baca et al., 2009).
