Responses During Salmonella Infection

Abstract: Production of IL-12 and IFN-(cid:1) secretion are important components of the protective host response against the 
intracellular bacterial pathogen, Salmonella typhimurium. While infection with Salmonella does elicit this T helper type 1 
response,  its  magnitude  does  not  appear  to  be  sufficient  to  prevent  infection  or  limit  pathogenesis.  Therefore  we  have  
investigated factors which might limit a T helper type 1 response following infection. Previously we found that infection 
of antigen presenting cells  with Salmonella dramatically increases cyclooxygenase-2  (COX-2) activity, resulting in high 
levels  of  prostaglandin  E2  (PGE2).  Since  PGE2  production  can  have  profound  effects  on  initiation  of  T  helper  type  1  
responses, we questioned whether this mediator might limit antigen-specific T cell activation. Here we show that blockage 
of  COX-2  activity  with  the  selective  inhibitor  celecoxib  leads  to  enhancement  of  the  T  helper  type  1  components  
stimulated  by  Salmonella  infection.  In  vitro  studies  demonstrate  the  induction  of  IL-12  and  IFN-(cid:1)  upon  Salmonella  
exposure,  which  are  further  increased  following  COX-2  inhibition.  Taken  together  these  in  vitro  studies  suggest  that 
COX-2 activity can limit a salmonella-initiated T helper type 1 response.  

INTRODUCTION 

  Oral  inoculation  of  susceptible  mice  with  Salmonella 
typhimurium  results  in  a  disease  state  similar  to  human  
typhoid  fever  and  serves  as  a  useful  model  for  intracellular 
bacterial infection. During infection of the intestinal mucosa, 
Salmonella  organisms  invade  and  then  survive  and  grow 
within resident macrophages and dendritic cells [1, 2]. If the 
inoculum  is  sufficient,  a  lethal,  systemic  disease  ensues. 
Salmonella’s  capacity  for  intracellular  survival  makes  the 
initiation  of  an  effective  cell-mediated  immune  response 
crucial  for  survival  of  the  host  [3-6].  Fundamental  to  this 
response is the activation of macrophages and dendritic cells 
to produce IL-12 p70, eliciting IFN-(cid:1) production from CD4+ 
T  cells,  which  further  enables  infected  cells  to  kill  the  
pathogens  they  harbor  [7,  8].  The  requirement  for  cellular 
immunity  is  observed  in  humans  with  genetic  defects  in  IL-
12  receptor  [3,  9]  or  IFN-(cid:1)  receptor  [7]  signaling,  who  
frequently  present  with  recurrent  Salmonella  infections.  
In  the  animal  model,  deletion  or  antagonism  of  IL-12  [6]  
or  IFN-(cid:1)  [10,  11]  increases  susceptibility  to  salmonellosis,  
further  supporting  the  importance  of  these  components  in 
resolving  infection.  While  these  cytokines  are  certainly  
produced in response to infection [6, 12], the fact that in vivo 
treatment  of  mice  with  recombinant  IL-12  augments  protec-
tion  [13]  suggests  that  endogenous  IL-12  production  may  
be less than optimal. 

  Although  the  presence  of  IL-12  at  the  time  of  T  cell  
activation  facilitates  the  development  of  the  T  helper  cell 
response,  it  has  been  suggested  that  another  player,  PGE2, 
can influence this process. Specifically, the ratio of IL-12 to

PGE2  is  the  limiting  factor  in  initiation  of  IFN-(cid:1)  production 
and commitment to a T helper type 1 lineage [14]. PGE2 has 
been shown to inhibit the secretion of IL-12p70 from human 
monocytes  and  bone  marrow  derived  dendritic  cells,  and 
selectively  induces  IL-12p40,  an  IL-12  antagonist  [15-17]. 
There  is  also  strong  evidence  for  PGE2-mediated  inhibition 
of  the  IL-12  receptor,  diminishing  IL-12  responsiveness 
[18].  Therefore  the  production  of  PGE2  in  the  environment 
of T cell activation has the potential to inhibit generation of a 
T  helper  type  1  mediated  immune  response.  Additionally, 
resistance  to  re-infection  requires  the  development  of  T 
helper  type  1  immunological  memory  [19],  and  the  IL-12 
signaling  pathway  is  necessary  for  an  effector  memory  
response  [9].  Carrier  state,  relapse  and  re-infection  may  
occur  in  both  S.  typhimurium  and  S.  typhi  related  etiologies 
[20],  with  the  implication  that  the  initial  infection  does  not 
bring about lasting immunity. 

Studies  in  our  laboratory  have  shown  that  macrophages 
 
and  dendritic  cells  are  activated  by  Salmonella  to  secrete  a 
significant  amount  of  PGE2  [21].  This  response  occurs  both 
in vitro and in vivo, is COX-2 dependent, and is generated to 
a  greater  extent  by  viable  pathogens  than  by  killed  bacteria 
or  LPS  [21].  This  suggests  that  Salmonella  stimulates  pro-
duction of conflicting mediators, and while this is a common 
theme  in  maintaining  homeostasis,  it  may  also  be  advanta-
geous  to  the  pathogen.  Because  the  initiation  of  an  adaptive 
immune response within this context may be hindered, it was 
of  interest  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  an  antigen  spe-
cific  T  helper  type  1  response  is  inhibited  by  this  particular 
feature  of  Salmonella  infection.  In  studies  presented  here, 
DO11.10  TCR  transgenic  animals  were  used  as  a  source  of 
CD4+  T  cells,  and  their  response  to  antigenic  stimulation  in 
the presence of infected macrophages and dendritic cells was 
assessed.  The  relative  contributions  of  COX-2,  contact,  and 
IL-12 were evaluated using this in vitro model.

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY 

Isolation  of  Peritoneal  Macrophages  and  Bone  Marrow 
Derived Dendritic Cells 

 
Peritoneal  macrophages  were  isolated  as  previously  
described  [22,  23].  Briefly,  BALB/c  mice  were  injected  
intraperitoneally  with  250  μl  of 
incomplete  Freund’s  
adjuvant  (Sigma  Chemical  Co.,  St  Louis,  MO).  Four  days 
later,  the mice were euthanized,  and peritoneal  cavities were 
lavaged  with  RPMI-1640  (Gibco-BRL,  Grand  Island,  NY) 
containing  2%  FCS.  Peritoneal  cells  were  washed  twice  
and  then  allowed  to  adhere  to  12-well  tissue  culture  plates 
(Costar,  Cambridge,  MA)  for  45  minutes  in  RPMI-1640  
containing 10% FCS before washing to remove non-adherent 
cells. 

  Bone  marrow  derived  dendritic  cells  were  isolated  as 
previously described [24]. Briefly, femurs were flushed with 
RPMI-1640 containing 2% FCS to collect total bone marrow 
cells.  Spicules  and  bone  matrix  were  allowed  to  settle  and 
removed. Total bone marrow cells were washed once and re-
suspended  in  RPMI-1640  containing  12%  FCS  and  1000 
U/ml  GM-CSF  (PharMingen,  San  Diego,  CA).  Cells  were 
fed  every  three  days  by  adding  50%  fresh  medium.  After  7 
days  in  culture,  non-adherent  cells  were  removed,  washed, 
and  aliquoted  into  tissue  culture  plates  in  RPMI-1640  10% 
FCS  without  antibiotics,  and  exposed  to  medium  or  wild 
type Salmonella as described below.  

  All  experiments using these  animals were conducted fol-
lowing  the  guidelines  set  forth  by  the  University  of  North 
Carolina  at  Charlotte  Institutional  Animal  Care  and  Use 
Committee.  

In  Vitro  Exposure  of  Macrophages  or  Dendritic  Cells  to 
Salmonella 

  Macrophages  or  dendritic  cells  cultured  in  RPMI-1640 
10%  FCS  without  antibiotics  were  briefly  exposed  to  live 
Salmonella at ratios of 3:1 or 10:1 bacteria to cells. After 45 
minutes, extracellular bacteria were removed by washing the 
cells  and  by  the  addition  of  gentamicin-containing  medium. 
Culture  supernatants  were  isolated  from  the  cultures  at  the 
indicated  times  post-infection  for  PGE2,  IFN-(cid:1),  or  IL-4 
analyses,  respectively.  In  addition,  some  cells  were  treated 
with  1μM  celecoxib  (Pharmacia  Corporation,  Peapack,  NJ) 
for 20 minutes prior to the addition of bacteria. 

Stimulation of CD4+ T Cells 

Spleens  were  harvested 

from  euthanized  BALB/c  
 
or  DO11.10  TCR  transgenic  mice  (The  Jackson  Laboratory, 
Bar  Harbor,  ME).  Single  cell  suspensions  were  prepared  by 
passage  through  a  stainless  steel  sieve  followed  by  lysis  of 
red blood cells.  CD4+  T cells were isolated with anti-mouse 
CD4  (L3T4)  conjugated  beads  according  to  manufacturers’ 
instructions  (Miltenyi,  Auburn,  CA).  B  lymphocytes  were 
isolated  from  BALB/c  splenocyte  suspensions  with  anti-
B220  conjugated  beads  (Miltenyi).  DO11.10  CD4+  cells 
were  cultured  with  equal  numbers  of  BALB/c  B  cells  as  
antigen  presenting  cells  and  stimulated  with  1  μg/ml  OVA 
peptide  (OVA323-339)  (Research  Genetics,  Huntsville,  AL). 
CD4+ T cells from BALB/c animals were stimulated with 50 
pg/ml 
(PharMingen).  Transwell  
cultures  were  performed  in  12-well  plates  using  12  mm 
diameter  polycarbonate  membranes  with  0.4  μm  pores 

recombinant

ameter polycarbonate membranes with 0.4 μm pores (Costar, 
Corning,  NY).  Anti  IL-12  or  isotype  control  antibodies 
(PharMingen) were used at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. 

Quantitation of PGE2 in Culture Supernatants 

PGE2  levels  in  culture  supernatants  were  analyzed  using 
 
the  Prostaglandin  E2  Direct  Biotrak  Assay  (Amersham 
Pharmacia  Biotech,  Piscataway,  NJ),  according  to  instruc-
tions from the manufacturer as previously described [21]. 

Quantitation  of  Cytokines  in  Culture  Supernatants  and 
Tissue Homogenates 

  Culture supernatants were assayed for IFN-(cid:1) or IL-12p70 
by  ELISA  using  the  appropriate  capture  and  detection  anti-
body pairs and recombinant standards (PharMingen). 

Statistical Analyses 

Statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  ANOVA 

 
analyses (Graphpad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). 

RESULTS 

PGE2  Production  is  Stimulated  by  Infection  of  Elicited 
Peritoneal Macrophages with Salmonella Typhimurium 

 
Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that 
macrophages  and  dendritic  cells  respond  to  Salmonella  in-
fection with a robust inflammatory response, producing large 
amounts  of  PGE2  [21]  This  response  has  been  shown  to  be 
dependent  on  COX-2  activity,  since  it  is  entirely  abrogated 
by  the  introduction  of  the  COX-2  specific  inhibitor  cele-
coxib.  The  amount  of  PGE2  secreted  during  an  encounter 
with  viable  bacteria  is  far  greater  than  that  produced  upon 
exposure  to  LPS  or  UV-killed  Salmonella.  These  same  cell 
types  are  responsible  for  PGE2  production  in  the  mesenteric 
lymph  nodes  after  oral  inoculation  with  Salmonella  [21]. 
Therefore  PGE2  is  present  in  the  microenvironment  of  im-
mune  induction  and  may  influence  the  initiation  of  an  anti-
gen-specific  response.  In  order  to  examine  the  pattern  of 
PGE2  production  in  the  context  of  antigen-specific  T  cell 
priming  during  Salmonella  infection,  mixed  cultures  of 
DO11.10  CD4+  T  cells,  B  cells,  and  elicited  peritoneal 
macrophages  or  bone  marrow-derived  dendritic  cells  were 
prepared and stimulated with the Ova peptide antigen. 

  The results of one such experiment are shown in Fig. (1). 
Resting  macrophages  produced  a  low  background  level  of 
PGE2,  most  likely  as  a  result  of  constitutive  expression  of 
COX-1  (Fig.  1A).  Culture  supernatants  from  T  and  B  cells 
contained  only  background  levels  of  PGE2,  even  when  anti-
gen  was  added  (Fig.  1A). When  macrophages  were  infected 
with Salmonella typhimurium at a multiplicity of infection of 
either 3:1 or 10:1, PGE2 secretion increased by more than an 
order  of  magnitude  (Fig.  1B).  The  addition  of  1  μM  cele-
coxib inhibited  this response,  indicating that PGE2  increases 
were due to COX-2 activity (Fig. 1B).  

  The  same  experiments  performed  with  dendritic  cells 
yielded similar results. Resting dendritic cells produced 0.26 
ng/ml  PGE2,  versus  2.07  ng/ml  when  infected  with  Salmo-
nella  at  a  ratio  of  3:1.  The  addition  of  T  and  B  cells  raised 
levels  to  0.40  ng/ml  in  uninfected  cultures  with  no  further 
increase  upon  addition  of  the  Ova  peptide.  Infected  cultures 
produced  3.0  ng/ml  PGE2 when  T  and  B  cells  were  present,

and levels increased significantly with addition of antigen to 
8.47 ng/ml (p=0.0002). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fig.  (1).  PGE2  production  in  mixed  cultures  of  DO11.10  CD4+  T 
cells,  B  cells,  and  elicited  peritoneal  macrophages  infected  with 
Salmonella typhimurium. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated and 
cultured in the presence of medium alone (A) or viable Salmonella 
(B). The dose of bacteria initially added to each well was 3:1 (3) or 
10:1 (10) bacteria to macrophage, as indicated. Following exposure 
for 45 minutes, cells were washed to remove any extracellular bac-
teria  with  gentamicin-containing  medium.  Magnetically  separated 
splenic  DO11.10  CD4  +  T  cells,  B  cells,  and  OVA  peptide  were 
added.  Some  cultures  were  supplemented  with  1  uM  celecoxib  20 
minutes prior to infection. Culture supernatants were collected at 24 
hours  post-infection  and  stored  at  -80°C.  Levels  of  PGE2  were 
measured  by  enzyme  immunoassay,  and  are  reported  as  mean  val-
ues of  triplicate determinations. An asterisk  indicates  a  statistically 
significant difference (p < 0.01) when compared to cultures without 
celecoxib.  These  studies  were  performed  three  times  with  similar 
results. 

Antigen-Driven  IFN-(cid:1)  Production  by  CD4+  T  Cells  is 
Stimulated  by  Infection  of  Cocultured  Peritoneal  Macro-
phages with Salmonella Typhimurium 

 
IFN-(cid:1)  production  via  Salmonella-infected  macrophages 
was exhibited by mixed cultures of DO11.10 CD4+ T and B 
cells (Fig. 2A). IFN-(cid:1) levels were significantly elevated (p < 
0.05) by the combination of both antigen and the presence of 
infected  macrophages  when  compared  to  similar  mixed  cul-
tures in the absence of antigen.  

  When  the  corresponding  studies  were  performed  using 
bone  marrow  derived  dendritic  cells,  a  similar  pattern  of 
IFN-(cid:1) secretion was observed (Fig. 2B). Among Ova  stimu-
lated cultures, the amount of secreted IFN-(cid:1) was found to be 
significantly  higher  where  dendritic  cells  had  been  exposed 
to  Salmonella (p  <  0.01).  These  results  indicate  that Salmo-

nella-infected dendritic cells, like macrophages, were able to 
augment  IFN-(cid:1)  production  in  the  presence  of  antigen  (Fig. 
2B). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fig.  (2).  Salmonella-infected  macrophages  augment  IFN-(cid:1)  produc-
tion  by  antigen-stimulated  DO11.10  CD4+  T  cells.  Peritoneal 
macrophages were isolated and cultured in the presence of medium 
alone  or  viable  Salmonella.  Following  exposure  for  45  minutes, 
cells  were  washed  to  remove  any  extracellular  bacteria  with  gen-
tamicin-containing medium.  Magnetically  separated DO11.10 CD4 
+ T cells, B cells, and OVA peptide were added as indicated (A). In 
other  studies,  bone  marrow-derived  dendritic  cells  were  infected 
with  Salmonella  and  treated  with  gentamicin  45  minutes  post-
infection and prior to  addition of DO11.10 CD4 + T cells, B cells, 
and  OVA  peptide  (B).  Levels  of  IFN-(cid:1)  were  measured  by  enzyme 
immunoassay,  and  are  reported  as  mean  values  of  triplicate  deter-
minations.  These  studies  were  performed  three  times  with  similar 
results. 

Contact  Inhibition  by  Transwell  Coculture  and  Anti-IL-
12 Each Partially Reduce the IFN-(cid:1) Response 

 
In  order  to  assess  the  individual  contributions  of  contact 
and  soluble  factors  to  IFN-(cid:1)  production,  additional  studies 
were  performed  with  macrophages  and  DO11.10  CD4+  T 
and B cells. In Fig. (3A), macrophages were separated from 
T and B cells by transwell barriers. Cultures were stimulated 
with  Ova  peptide  for  48  hours,  at  which  time  supernatants 
were collected and assayed for levels of IFN-(cid:1). Prevention of 
physical  contact  between  macrophages  and  T  cells  reduced 
the  amount  of  IFN-(cid:1)  produced  by  less  than  half,  indicating 

26    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2009, Volume 3 

that  while  some  of  this  response  is  contact  dependent,  a  
significant portion is reliant on soluble factors (Fig. 3A).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Fig.  (3).  IFN-(cid:1)  production  in  mixed  and  transwell  cultures  of 
DO11.10 CD4+ T cells and elicited peritoneal macrophages. T cells 
and macrophages were co-cultured or cultured in transwell. Perito-
neal  macrophages  were  isolated  and  cultured  in  the  presence  of 
medium  alone  or  viable  Salmonella.  Following  exposure  for  45 
minutes,  cells  were  washed  to  remove  any  extracellular  bacteria 
with  gentamicin-containing  medium.  Magnetically  separated 
splenic DO11.10 CD4 + T cells, B cells, and OVA peptide were co-
cultured or separated by transwells (A). To evaluate the role of IL-
12,  some  mixed  cultures  were  supplemented  with  anti-IL-12p40 
antibody  or  isotype  control  antibody  (B).  Levels  of  IFN-(cid:1)  in  48-
hour supernatants were measured by enzyme immunoassay, and are 
reported  as  mean  values  of  triplicate  determinations.  These  studies 
were performed three times with similar results. 

  To determine the nature of this soluble stimulation,  anti-
IL-12  antibodies  were  added  to  cultures  (Fig.  3B).  While 
IFN-(cid:1) levels were unperturbed by addition of isotype control 
antibody,  reductions  were  observed  in  those  cultures  treated 
with  anti-IL-12  (Fig.  3B).  Taken  together,  the  studies  pre-
sented demonstrate the relative contributions of both cellular 
contact  and IL-12 in the activation of antigen-specific IFN-(cid:1) 
production. 

COX-2  Activity  Influences  IFN-(cid:1)  Production  in  Antigen 
Stimulated Cultures of DO11.10 CD4+ T Cells 

  We  next  questioned  whether  Celecoxib  could  inhibit 
IFN-(cid:1)  production  in  antigen  stimulated  cultures  of  CD4+  T 
cells. To address this question, DO11.10 CD4+ T cells and B 
cells,  stimulated  with  Ova  peptide,  were  incubated  with  
untreated  (Fig.  4A)  or  cultured  with  Salmonella-infected 

Bowman and Bost 

macrophages  (Fig.  4B).  In  addition,  some  cultures  were 
treated with 1 uM celecoxib to hinder COX-2 activity. IFN-(cid:1) 
levels  are  augmented  by  the  addition  of  celecoxib  in  both 
uninfected (Fig 4A) and infected (Fig. 4B) co-cultures.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fig. (4). COX-2 activity influences IFN-(cid:1) and IL-12p70 production 
in antigen stimulated cultures of DO11.10 CD4+ T cells. Peritoneal 
macrophages were isolated and cultured in the presence of medium 
alone  (A)  or  viable  Salmonella  (B).  Following  exposure  for  45 
minutes,  cells  were  washed  to  remove  any  extracellular  bacteria 
with  gentamicin-containing  medium.  Magnetically  separated 
splenic  DO11.10  CD4  +  T  cells,  B  cells,  and  OVA  peptide  were 
added.  To  assess  the  role  of  COX-2,  some  cultures  were  supple-
mented  with  1  uM  celecoxib  20  minutes  prior  to  infection.  Levels 
of IFN-(cid:1) (A and B) and IL-12p70 (C) in 48-hour supernatants were 
measured  by  enzyme  immunoassay,  and  are  reported  as  mean  val-
ues of triplicate determinations. These studies were performed three 
times with similar results. 

  Analysis  of  supernatants  from  mixed  cultures  of  macro-
phages  and  DO11.10  CD4+  T  and  B  cells  revealed  that  in-
fection with Salmonella does elicit in vitro production of IL-

12p70  (Fig.  4C).  Inhibition  of  COX-2  with  celecoxib  
treatment  further  increased  IL-12  secretion,  indicating  that 
the  endogenous  PGE2  synthesis  resulting  from  infection  can 
reduce the IL-12 response (Fig. 4C). 

COX-2 Activity Influences IFN-(cid:1)  Production  in Cultures 
Exposed to Recombinant IL-12 

  We  next  questioned  whether  treatment  with  celecoxib 
could  alter  IL-12-induced  IFN-(cid:1)  secretion  in  co-cultures  
of  CD4+  T  cells  and  macrophages.  Fig.  (5A)  demonstrates 
that  IL-12-induced  IFN-(cid:1)  production  was  significantly  
increased  in  the presence of celecoxib.  More  importantly,  in 
Salmonella  infected  cultures,  a  significant  increase  in  IFN-(cid:1) 
production  was  also  observed  with  celecoxib  treatment.  
Collectively,  these  results  support  the  notion  that  COX-2 
activity limits IL-12 induced IFN-(cid:1) production.

stimulated  cultures  of  BALB/c  CD4+  T  cells.  IFN-(cid:1)  production  
by  CD4  +  T  cells  in  the  presence  or  absence  of  celecoxib  was 
evaluated. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated and cultured in the 
presence of medium alone (A) or viable Salmonella (B). Following 
exposure for 45 minutes, cells were washed to remove any extracel-
lular  bacteria  with  gentamicin-containing  medium.  Magnetically 
separated  splenic  BALB/c  CD4  +  T  cells  were  added  and  cultured 
in  the  presence  of  IL-12  and/or  celecoxib.  Results  are  presented  
as  mean  values  of  triplicate  determinations.  These  studies  were 
performed twice with similar results. 

DISCUSSION 

  We  have  previously  demonstrated  a  surprising  potential 
for  induction  of  PGE2  synthesis  upon  infection  with Salmo-

nella  typhimurium  both  in  cultured  immune  cells  and  
lymphoid  tissue  [21].  High  levels  of  PGE2 can  be  inhibitory 
for T cell-mediated  immunity, a vital  component of the host 
defense  against  Salmonella.  The  fact  that  PGE2  production 
occurs in the mesenteric lymph nodes demonstrates the pres-
ence  of  increased  prostaglandins  at  mucosal  sites  following 
infection,  and  suggests  that  these  mediators  are  present  to 
influence the developing host response [21].  

they  are  exposed 

In  the  current  study  we  began  to  address  the  impact  

 
of COX-2 activation and PGE2 production on IFN-(cid:1) produc-
tion  using  co-cultures  of  antigen-specific  CD4+  T  lympho-
cytes  and  Salmonella-infected  macrophages  and  dendritic 
cells.  When  DO11.10  CD4+  T  cells  are  co-cultured  with 
Salmonella-infected  macrophages, 
to  
elevated  amounts  of  PGE2  (Fig.  1B).  This  in  vitro  result 
seems  to  mimic  what  occurs  in  vivo  [21].  Salmonella-
infected macrophages (Fig. 2A), or dendritic cells (Fig. 2B), 
augment  the production of IFN-(cid:1) by DO11.10 CD4+ T cells 
in  the  presence  of  antigen.  This  antigen-stimulated  IFN-(cid:1) 
(cid:3)production  in  macrophage-infected  cultures  is  enhanced  
by  cell/cell  contact  (Fig.  3A)  or  by  IL-12  produced  in  these 
co-cultures  (Fig.  3B).  The  presence  of  celecoxib  signifi-
cantly  elevates  the  levels  of  IFN-(cid:1)  (cid:3)(Figs.  4A  and  4B)  and  
IL-12p70  (Fig.  4C)  produced  in  these  antigen-stimulated  
co-cultures.  Taken  together  these  in  vitro  studies  demon-
strate that blocking COX-2 activity can significantly increase 
mediators  (i.e.  IFN-(cid:1)  and  IL-12)  which  augment  T  helper 
type 1 responses [3-7].

If  these  in  vitro  studies  accurately  depict  what  occurs  
 
in  vivo  following  Salmonella  infection,  then  they  may  have 
important  implications for this bacterial  infection being  able 
to limit  a protective  T helper  type 1 response. The ability of 
Salmonella  infection  to  induce  the  production  of  PGE2  
in  vivo  [21]  and  in  vitro  (Fig.  1)  likely  serves  to  limit  a  
T helper  type 1 response [14-18]. While this response  could 
be  beneficial 
limiting  a  destructive,  
pro-inflammatory  response,  it  may  also  limit  the  T  helper 
type  1  response  below  what  would  be  optimal  for  the  
immune 
intracellular  pathogen.  
Evidence to support this possibility comes from our previous 
work  demonstrating  that  therapeutic  administration  of  IL-12 
can augment the protective host response against Salmonella 
[13].  The  implication  of  this  finding  is  that  the  host  does  
not  produce  sufficient  amounts  of  this  cytokine  to  initiate  
a  protective  T  helper  type  1  response.  The  present  work  
suggests  that  one  mechanism  which  may  be  responsible  for 
limiting  IL-12  initiated  IFN-(cid:1)  is  the  presence  of  PGE2  
induced  by  Salmonella.  Future  studies  will  be  necessary  to 
determine  if  treatment  with  COX-2  inhibitors  can  augment 
the protective T helper type 1 response against Salmonella in 
animal models.
