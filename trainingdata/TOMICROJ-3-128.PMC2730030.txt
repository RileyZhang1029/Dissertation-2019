Abstract: Biosynthesis of biosurfactant rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa depends on  two hierarchical quorum 
sensing systems, LasRI and RhlRI, which synthesize  and sense  the signal molecules N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine 
lactone  (3OC12-HSL)  and  N-butyryl-L-homoserine  lactone  (C4-HSL),  respectively.  The  Pseudomonas  Quinolone  Signal 
(PQS) is a third cell-to-cell signal molecule connecting these two systems, and its precursor, 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ), 
also constitutes  a signal. The chronology of the production of signal molecules and rhamnolipids was determined during 
growth  in  PPGAS  medium.  Hyperosmotic  condition  (0.5  M  NaCl)  moderately  affected  growth,  and  led  to  intra-cellular 
accumulation  of  compatible  solutes.  Production  of  signal  molecules  was  delayed  and  their  highest  concentrations  were  
2.5  to  5  fold  lower  than  in  NaCl-free  PPGAS,  except  for  HHQ,  the  highest  concentration  of  which  was  increased.  The 
presence of NaCl prevented rhamnolipid synthesis. When the osmoprotectant glycine betaine was added to PPGAS/NaCl 
medium,  it  was  imported  by  the  cells  without  being  metabolized.  This  did  not  improve  growth,  but  reestablished  the  
time-courses  of  HSL  and  HHQ  accumulation  and  fully  or  partially  restored  the  HSL  and  PQS  levels.  It  also  partially  
restored  rhamnolipid  production.  Quantification  of  mRNAs  encoding  enzymes  involved  in  HSL,  PQS,  and  rhamnolipid 
biosyntheses confirmed the effect of hyperosmotic stress and glycine betaine at the gene expression level.

INTRODUCTION 

  Rhamnolipids  are  biosurfactants,  ie  amphipathic  mole-
cules  reducing  water  surface  tension  and  emulsifying  oil,  of 
glycolipidic  nature.  They  are  produced  by  the  opportunistic 
pathogen  bacterium  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa,  which  is  in 
particular  responsible  for  chronic  lung  infection  of  cystic 
fibrosis  patients  [1],  and  rhamnolipids  are  considered  as 
virulence  factors  with  multiple  biological  activities  [2,  3]. 
Many  other  functions  are  attributed  to  rhamnolipids,  includ-
ing  anti-microbial  activities  and  biofilm  maintenance,  as 
reviewed  by  Soberón-Chávez  et  al.  [2].  Rhamnolipid  pro-
duction  is  coordinated  with  that  of  other  virulence  factors 
[4]:  the  rhlAB  operon  and  the  rhlC  gene  encoding  enzymes 
involved  in  rhamnolipid  biosynthesis  are  regulated  by  the 
RhlRI  quorum  sensing  (QS)  system  [5-7].  RhlI  synthesizes 
the  cell-to-cell  communication  molecule  N-butyryl-L-
homoserine  lactone  (C4-HSL),  and  RhlR  activates  transcrip-
tion of target genes after C4-HSL binding. The RhlRI system

itself  depends  on  the  LasRI  QS  system,  which  synthesizes 
and  binds  N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine 
lactone 
(3OC12-HSL) [8-10]. These two hierarchical QS systems are 
embedded into a large regulatory network, which includes in 
particular  a  third  communication  molecule,  2-heptyl-3-
hydroxy-4-quinolone  more  commonly  known  as  the  Pseu-
domonas  quinolone  signal  (PQS)  [8-12].  PQS  synthesis  oc-
curs  via  a  condensation  of  anthranilate  and  (cid:1)-keto  dode-
canoate and requires the genes pqsABCD (forming an operon 
with  the  pqsE  gene,  which  encodes  a  regulator  involved  in 
the QS network but not in PQS synthesis [13]) and pqsH [11, 
12,  14].  The  latter  encodes  the  enzyme  responsible  for  the 
last  step  of  PQS  synthesis:  the  modification  of  2-heptyl-4-
quinolone  (HHQ)  in  PQS  [11,  12,  14].  Since  it  is  both  
released  from,  and  taken  up  by  bacteria,  HHQ  is  itself  
suggested  to  act  as  an  intercellular  message  molecule  [15]. 
LasR  and  RhlR  control  PQS  synthesis  [16],  whereas  PQS 
positively regulates  the RhlRI system [16-19]. In addition to 
this indirect action of PQS on rhamnolipid production via the 
RhlRI  system,  two  other  relationships  were  established  be-
tween  PQS  and  rhamnolipids:  the  two  molecules  share  the 
common  precursors  (cid:1)-keto-(do)decanoic  acids  [20],  and 
rhamnolipids  increase  PQS  solubility  and  bioactivity  [21]. 
PQS,  but  not  HHQ,  was  recently  shown  to  both  sensitize 
bacteria  towards  exogenous  stresses  and  trigger  an  efficient

stress  response,  thus  leading  to  consider  PQS  as  internal 
stress response molecule [22].  

encoding  enzymes  responsible  for  biosynthesis  of  these 
molecules were then compared in the two growth conditions.  

  The  fact  that  QS  systems  are  part  of  a  large  regulatory 
network leads  to the view that P. aeruginosa QS is not only 
dependent  on  cell  density,  but  also  on  a  wide  variety  of  
environmental signals, most of which remain to identify. We 
observed  that  hyperosmotic  stress  is  one  of  these  signals 
[23].  High  salinity  conditions  are  frequently  encountered  in 
P.  aeruginosa  habitats,  such  as  soils,  marshes  and  marine 
coasts.  Furthermore,  high  NaCl  concentrations  are  found  in 
respiratory  tract  fluids  from  cystic  fibrosis  patients  [24]. 
Osmoadaptation  is  thus  critical  to P.  aeruginosa  survival  in 
the  environment,  and  might  play  a  role  in  its  pathogenicity. 
Bacteria  generally  cope  with  hyperosmotic  conditions  by 
accumulating  low  molecular  mass  molecules  that  are  com-
patible with cellular processes at high internal concentrations 
[25].  These  molecules, 
termed  compatible  solutes  or  
osmoprotectants,  are  either  synthesized  by  the  bacteria  or  
imported  from  the  environment.  Osmotically-stressed  P. 
aeruginosa  PAO1  was  shown  to  synthesize  and  accumulate 
glutamate, trehalose and N-acetylglutaminylglutamine amide 
(NAGGN)  in  the  absence  of  exogenous  osmoprotectant,  but 
preferentially  accumulated  glycine  betaine  (GB)  when  the 
latter  was  added  to  the  culture  medium  [26].  GB  is  the  pre-
ferred compatible solute for most of the bacteria [25], and its 
uptake  by  P.  aeruginosa  PAO1  prevented  the  accumulation 
of  the  three  endogenous  osmoprotectants  [26].  GB  can  also 
be  used  by  P.  aeruginosa  PAO1  as  carbon  and  nitrogen 
sources  [27],  and  we  showed  that  GB  was  metabolized  in 
M63 minimal medium when the  carbon source was glucose, 
whereas  it  was  stably  accumulated  in  succinate  M63  [28]. 
Regarding  HSL  and  rhamnolipid  production,  we  reported 
that a hyperosmotic stress (0.5 M NaCl) applied to exponen-
tially-growing  P.  aeruginosa  PAO1  interrupted  3OC12-HSL 
production  and  prevented  C4-HSL  and  rhamnolipid  synthe-
ses  [23].  These  defects  were  explained  by  reduced  levels  of 
rhlI,  rhlAB,  and  rhlC  mRNAs.  The  addition  of  GB  partially 
restored  rhlI  expression  and  C4-HSL  production,  as  well  as 
rhlC  expression,  thereby  reestablishing  rhamnolipid  synthe-
sis.  However,  the  rhamnolipid  production  level  remained 
low,  likely  because  GB  had  only  a  marginal  positive  effect 
on  rhlAB  expression  [23].  The  osmotic  stress  studies  are 
generally  performed  in  minimal  media  since  components  of 
rich  media  could  bring  osmoprotectants  in  an  uncontrolled 
fashion. However,  the use of  a  M63-based  minimal  medium 
(PLM63:  M63  limited  in  phosphate  in  order  to  obtain  
rhamnolipid  production)  did  not  allow  to  fully  appreciate  
the  hyperosmotic  stress  effect  on  3OC12-HSL  production 
since P. aeruginosa PAO1 failed to grow if NaCl was added 
before  the  synthesis  onset  of  this  communication  molecule. 
To obtain a more complete picture of the effects of hyperos-
motic  conditions  on  P.  aeruginosa  QS  and  on  rhamnolipid 
production,  we  used  here  the  rich  PPGAS  medium,  which 
favors  rhamnolipid  production  [29]  and  we  extended  our 
field  of  investigation  to  PQS  since  this  signal  molecule  
is  part  of  the  QS  network  and  constitutes  an  internal  stress 
response  signal. We  examined  here  the  time-course  produc-
tion  of  rhamnolipids,  of  both  HSLs,  and  of  PQS  and  its  
precursor  HHQ  by  P.  aeruginosa  PAO1  in  PPGAS  with  or 
without  hyperosmotic  stress.  The  expression  levels  of  genes 

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY 

Bacterial Strain and Culture Conditions 

  P.  aeruginosa  PAO1  (obtained  from  M.  Foglino,  
Marseille, France) was grown in PPGAS medium (NH4Cl 20 
mM;  KCl  20  mM;  Tris-HCl  120  mM;  MgSO4  1.6  mM;  
glucose 0.5 %; tryptone 1%, adjusted to pH 7.2 [29]) at 37°C 
with shaking, and growth was followed by measuring optical 
density  at  600  nm  (OD600).  Hyperosmotic  conditions  were 
obtained  by  including  0.5  M  NaCl  into  the  medium  before 
inoculation.  GB  was  used  at  a  final  concentration  of  1  mM. 
When  indicated,  C4-HSL  (Sigma-Aldrich  Co.,  St.  Louis, 
USA) and PQS (P. Williams, University of Nottingham, UK) 
were respectively added at final concentrations of 10 μM and 
of 2 mM. 

Extraction  and  Analysis  of  HSLs,  PQS,  HHQ,  and 
Rhamnolipids 

  HSLs  were  extracted  from  culture  supernatants  as  
described  by  Bazire  et  al.  [23],  and  quantified  by  liquid  
chromatography-mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS-MS)  according 
to  Morin  et  al.  [30].  PQS  and  HHQ  were  extracted  as  the 
HSLs,  and  analyzed  as  described  by  Lépine  et  al.  [31].  LC 
separation  conditions  were  optimized  as  follows.  The  initial 
acetonitrile  concentration  in  water  was  linearly  increased 
from 20% to 59% in 10 min, kept stable for an additional 13 
min,  increased  to  98%  in  1  min,  kept  stable  during  6  min, 
and returned to the initial value in 1 min and left to stabilize 
for  another  9  min.  Compounds  were  detected  by  an  ion  
trap  spectrometer  (Bruker  Daltonics,  Germany).  Operating 
conditions of  the  MS  source were capillary voltage, 4.0 kV; 
nebuliser  pressure,  12  psi;  drying  gas  flow,  7  L/min  at 
300°C. The mass spectrometer was run in full scan MS. The 
trap  parameters  were  set  in  ion  charge  control  with  a  target 
of  30 000  and  a  maximum  accumulation  time  of  400  ms  at 
m/z ranging from 50 to 400. Quantification of HHQ and PQS 
was  performed  by  using  external  standard.  Rhamnolipids 
were  identified  and  quantified  from  culture  supernatants  
using LC-MS as previously reported [23, 32]. The proportion 
of  each  rhamnolipid  was  obtained  from  the  corresponding 
m/z [M-H](cid:1) chromatograms by measure of peak areas. 

RNA  Quantification  by  Quantitative  Reverse  Trans- 
cription-PCR (qRT-PCR)  

  RNAs were  extracted using RNAprotect bacteria reagent 
(Qiagen,  Hilden,  Germany)  and  the  Master  PureTm  RNA  
purification  kit  (Epicentre®  Biotechnologies,  Madison, 
USA).  RNAs  were  converted  to  cDNAs  using  the  High  
Capacity  cDNA  Archive  Kit  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster 
City,  USA).  mRNAs  were  quantified  by  real-time  PCR  
amplification  of  their  cDNAs  with  the  7300  Real  Time  
PCR  System  apparatus  and  SYBR  Green  PCR  Master  Mix 
(Applied  Biosystems),  using  previously  described  proce-
dures  [33].  The  primer  sequences  used  for  16S  rRNA,  and 
rhlAB, rhlC and rhlI mRNAs were given in [23], whereas the 
sequences of the other primers are in Table 1. PCR reactions 
were performed in triplicate and the standard deviations were 
lower  than  0.15  CT.  The  relative  quantification  of  the 

130    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2009, Volume 3 

mRNAs  of  interest  was  obtained  by  the  comparative  CT 
(2(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:1)CT)  method  [34],  using  16S  rRNA  as  endogenous  
control.  (cid:1)CT  values  were  calculated  by  subtracting  the  16S 
CT value from the CT value of an mRNA of interest from the 
same sample. (cid:1)(cid:1)CT values were then obtained by calculating 
the  difference  between:  i)  the  (cid:1)CT  value  of  a  given  mRNA 
resulting  from  cells  grown  in  the  presence  of  NaCl  with  or 
without GB, and  ii)  the (cid:1)CT value of the same  mRNA from 
cells  grown  in  NaCl-free  PPGAS.  Relative  mRNA  level  
values resulted from calculating 2–(cid:1)(cid:1)CT values: values  above 
and  below  1  show  a  higher  and  a  lower  mRNA  level  in  the 
presence of NaCl, respectively (e.g. a value of 2 indicates a 2 
fold increased mRNA level in hyperosmotic condition; and a 
value of 0.5 reveals that the mRNA level was divided by 2 in 
hyperosmotic condition).

GB Assimilation Assays  

  The  fate  of  GB  was  studied  with  [methyl-14C]GB  (2.07 
GBq.mmol-1), which was prepared from [methyl-14C]choline 
chloride  (2.07  GBq.mmol-1)  as  described  by  Bernard  et  al. 
[35].  Cells  were  grown  in  PPGAS  medium  without  or  with 
0.5  M  NaCl,  and  supplemented  with  1  mM  [14C]GB  (3.3 
MBq.mmol-1).  After  two  to  five  generations,  1  ml  of  cell 
culture  was  harvested  by  centrifugation  (10,000  x  g  for  10 
min).  After  extraction  in  80%  ethanol,  the  radioactive  
components  of  the  ethanol-soluble  fraction  were  analysed  
by  paper  chromatography  and/or  electrophoresis  [35].  The 
radioactive  spots  were  visualised  using  a  Packard  Instant 
Imager.  The  radioactivity  of  the  ethanol-insoluble  fraction 
and  of  CO2  trapped  on  filter  paper  soaked  with  6  M  KOH 
was also determined.

Freshly  harvested  and  washed  cells  were  extracted  in

fraction) was evaporated to dryness  at 40°C,  the dry residue 
was  dissolved  into  D2O  and  the  13C  NMR  spectrum  was  
recorded as previously described [35].

RESULTS 

Time-courses  of  Rhamnolipid,  HSL,  HHQ,  and  PQS 
Production in PPGAS Medium  

  We  first  identified  by  LC-MS  the  rhamnolipid  species 
which  were  produced  by  P.  aeruginosa  PAO1  grown  at  
37°C  in  PPGAS.  Three  mono-rhamnolipids  and  six  di-
rhamnolipids  were  identified  from  supernatants  of  48  h  
cultures  with  the  following  proportions:  Rha-Rha-C10-C10, 
63.67%;  Rha-Rha-C10-C12,  19.39%;  Rha-Rha-C10-C12:1, 
9.33%.  Rha-Rha-C10-C8,  2.39%;  Rha-C10-C10,  2.31%;  Rha-
Rha-C12-C12,  1.16%;  Rha-Rha-C12-C12:1,  0.94%;  Rha-C10-
C12,  0.28%.  Rha-C10-C12:1,  0.27%.  Like  in  PLM63  medium 
[23],  the  major  species  were,  in  decreasing  order,  the  di-
rhamnolipids  Rha-Rha-C10-C10,  Rha-Rha-C10-C12,  and  Rha-
Rha-C10-C12:1  corresponding  to  ions  649,  677,  and  675,  
respectively.  Their  production  occurred  mainly  during  
stationary phase, between 24 and 48 h of culture (Fig. 1). In 
the  subsequent  experiments,  we  only  quantified  the  most 
abundant  rhamnolipid  (Rha-Rha-C10-C10)  at  48  h  of  culture. 
Since  transcription  of  rhamnolipid  biosynthesis  genes rhlAB 
and  rhlC  is  dependent  on  the  RhlRI  QS  system,  which  is

itself  controlled  by  the  LasRI  and  PQS  systems,  we  
examined  the  time-course  of  extra-cellular  accumulation  of 
the corresponding signal molecules  C4-HSL, 3OC12-HSL,  as 
well  as  the  quinolones  PQS  and  HHQ.  To  take  into  account 
the  bacterial  population 
the  signal  molecule  
concentrations  were  divided  by  the  corresponding  OD600 
values  (Fig.  2).  The  highest  concentrations  of  these  signal 
molecules  are  given  in  Table  2.  3OC12-HSL  concentration 
per  OD600  unit  reached  its  peak  during  the  exponential 
growth phase (Fig. 2B). 3OC12-HSL had almost disappeared 
from  culture  supernatants  after  12  h  of  culture,  at  the  entry 
into  stationary  phase.  PQS  and  HHQ  concentrations  per 
OD600  unit  reached  their  peaks  at  the  end  of  exponential 
phase of growth (Fig. 2D and  E).  C4-HSL concentration per 
OD600  unit  increased  throughout  the  exponential  phase  and 
the  beginning  of  the  stationary  phase,  reaching  its  highest

PPGAS containing 0.5 M NaCl and 1 mM glycine betaine (circles). The signal molecules concentrations (in μM) were divided by the OD600

level  after  20  h  of  culture  (Fig.  2C).  qRT-PCR  assays 
showed  that  the  amounts  of  rhlAB  and  rhlC  mRNAs  
increased 6.5 and 24 fold, respectively, between 20 and 30 h 
of  culture  (not  shown),  ie  subsequently  to  the  C4-HSL  peak 
and during the rhamnolipid production period.  

Osmoadaptation of P. aeruginosa in PPGAS Medium 

less  detrimental 

  Hyperosmotic  conditions  were 
in 
PPGAS medium than in the minimal PLM63 medium previ-
ously used: when 0.5 M NaCl was added before inoculating 
the bacteria, P. aeruginosa PAO1 failed to grow in PLM63, 
whereas  its  growth  was  only  slightly  affected  in  PPGAS 
(Fig. 2A). The addition of the osmoprotectant GB in PPGAS 
containing  0.5  M  NaCl  had  no  effect  on  bacterial  growth 
(Fig.  2A).  Growth  was  more  strongly  impaired  by  higher 
NaCl  concentrations  (0.7  and  0.9  M),  but  it  was  partially 
reestablished  by  the  presence  of  GB  (not  shown). We  chose 
to  perform  the  subsequent  experiments  with  0.5  M  NaCl, 
since this concentration only moderately affected growth and 
it  allowed  examining  the  GB  effect  on  QS  and  rhamnolipid 
production  independently  from  an  action  on  growth.  To  
understand  how  P.  aeruginosa  adapted  to  NaCl  in  PPGAS 
medium,  we  searched  for  the  major  osmolytes  accumulated 
in  the  cells.  In  the  absence  of  exogenously  added  GB,  P. 

aeruginosa  PAO1  accumulated  glutamate,  NAGGN,  and 
trehalose (Fig. 3,  compare  B and A), as previously observed 
in  minimal  media  [26,  28].  No  GB  accumulation  was  
observed  (Fig.  3B),  showing  that  it  was  not  provided  by  the 
PPGAS  medium.  By  contrast,  when  GB  was  added  to  the 
culture  medium,  it  was  the  main  accumulated  osmopro- 
tectant (Fig. 3C). GB was still present in cells during station-
ary  phase  (Fig.  3D),  indicating  that  it  was  not  metabolized  
by  P.  aeruginosa  in  this  medium.  This  was  confirmed  by 
following  the  fate  of  [methyl-14C]GB  added  to  PPGAS  
(not shown).  

Hyperosmotic Condition Abolishes Rhamnolipid Produc-
tion in the Absence of GB 

 
In  the  presence  of  0.5  M  NaCl,  we  did  not  detect  rham-
nolipid  in  PPGAS  culture  supernatants  of  P.  aeruginosa 
PAO1  (Table  3). We  also  failed  to  detect  rhamnolipid  from 
cell  extracts  whereas  rhamnolipids  were  detected  from  
extracts  of  PAO1  grown  in  NaCl-free  PPGAS  (not  shown). 
This  showed  that  the  defect  in  rhamnolipid  production  in 
hyperosmotic condition was at the synthesis level rather than

fully  restored  the rhlAB  mRNA  level,  and  partially  restored 
the rhlC mRNA amount, which was then only 1.5 fold lower 
than  in  PPGAS.  GB  also  reestablished  the  rhamnolipid  
production, albeit to a 2.5 fold lower level than in NaCl-free 
PPGAS,  as  observed  by  assaying  di-rhamnolipid  Rha-Rha-
C10-C10 (Table 3). Since RhlC is responsible for the forma-
tion  of  di-rhamnolipids  from  mono-rhamnolipids  [7]  and  
the  expression  of  its  gene  was  not  fully  restored  by  GB,  
we  quantified 
the  most  abundant  
mono-rhamnolipid,  Rha-C10-C10,  in  PPGAS/NaCl/GB,  but  it 
remained lower than in PPGAS/NaCl (Table 3).

and  C4-HSL  accumulation  were  similar  to  those  seen  in

course  production  without  improving  growth,  the  delays

submitted  to  0.5  M  osmotic  shock  without  glycine  betaine  (GB)  or  in  its  presence.  RNAs  were  extracted  after  20  h  of  growth  and  the  
expression  levels  were  determined  by  qRT-PCR,  relatively  to  the  expression  in  PPGAS  medium  without  stress.  Primers  internal  to  rhlA, 
pqsC  and  pqsE  were  used  to  quantify  rhlAB  and  pqsABCDE  mRNAs.  Relative  values  lower  than  1  indicate  reduction  of  gene  expression 
upon stress (e.g. a value of 0.5 reveals that the mRNA level was divided by 2 in hyperosmotic  condition). 16S rRNA was used as endoge-
nous control  to normalize the RNA  input and reverse  transcription efficiency. PCR reactions were performed in  triplicate and the  standard 
deviations were lower than 0.15 CT. 

observed  in  PPGAS/NaCl  compared  to  PPGAS  cannot  be 
attributed  to  the  slower  bacterial  growth  in  hyperosmotic 
condition.  GB  furthermore  reestablished  the  3OC12-HSL 
production  level,  which  was  even  slightly  higher  than  in 
PPGAS  (Table  2  and  Fig.  2B).  By  contrast,  the  C4-HSL  
production level remained  lower (2.5 fold) in PPGAS/NaCl/ 
GB  than  in  PPGAS  (Table  2  and  Fig.  2C),  indicating  that 
hyperosmotic  stress  affects  the  C4-HSL  production  inde-
pendently  from  that  of  3OC12-HSL.  The  reductions  in  HSL 
levels  in  salt-containing  media  can  be  explained  by  the  lasI 
and  rhlI  expression:  their  mRNA  amounts  were  divided  by 
10  and  4.3  in  PPGAS/NaCl  and  by  1.2  and  2.3  PPGAS/ 
NaCl/GB (Fig. 4), respectively, compared to PPGAS. 

Hyperosmotic  Condition  Impairs  Accumulation  of  PQS, 
but not of HHQ  

 
In  the  presence  of  NaCl,  PQS  production  was  dramati-
cally  impaired  during  the  end  of  growth  and  the  entry  into 
the stationary phase,  and resumed only during the stationary 
phase  (Fig.  2E).  By  contrast,  the  production  of  its  precursor 
HHQ  was  markedly  less  affected  by  osmotic  stress  (Fig. 

2D).  Consistently,  the  osmotic  condition  led  to  a  2.5  fold 
decrease  of  the  highest  PQS  concentration,  whereas  the 
highest HHQ concentration was 1.7 fold increased (Table 2). 
GB  allowed  P.  aeruginosa  to  produce  higher  amounts  of 
PQS  in  PPGAS/NaCl  medium  (Table  2),  but  this  occurred 
mainly  during  stationary  phase  and  GB  therefore  failed  to 
restore  the  time-course  of  PQS  production  (Fig.  2E).  We 
investigated  the  levels  of pqsABCDE  (using  pqsC  and  pqsE 
primers)  and  pqsH  mRNAs,  the  products  of  which  are  
involved  in  PQS  biosynthesis  (pqsABCD  and  pqsH)  and  in 
regulation of a part of the QS network (pqsE).  The presence 
of NaCl led to a decreased level of pqsH mRNA, which was 
2  fold  lower,  but  not  of  pqsABCDE  mRNA  (Fig.  4).  Since 
PqsH is responsible for the conversion of HHQ to PQS, this 
result  explains  in  part  that  hyperosmotic  condition  impairs 
the production of PQS, but not of HHQ. 

DISCUSSION 

  We  examined  here 
time-courses  of  HSL  and  
quinolone  accumulations  in  rich  PPGAS  medium  by  the  
wild type P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain. As expected from the  
hierarchy between the QS systems [8-10, 36] and as reported 

the 

134    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2009, Volume 3 

for HSLs in  minimal  M63  and PLM63  media [23],  the peak 
of  3OC12-HSL  per  OD600  unit  was  first  observed,  followed 
by the peaks of HHQ and PQS, and finally of C4-HSL. These 
peaks were reached during the  exponential growth phase for 
3OC12-HSL, stationary phase for C4-HSL, and between these 
two  phases  for  quinolones.  Rhamnolipid  production  is  
dependent  on  both  PQS  and  RhlRI  QS  system  [5,  6,  36], 
which  produces  and  senses  C4-HSL.  Consistently,  we  
observed  that  rhamnolipids  were  mainly  produced  subse-
quently  to  the  peak  of  C4-HSL  per  OD600  unit.  In  PPGAS 
medium,  0.5  M  NaCl  delayed  and  strongly  reduced  the  
accumulation of both HSLs and of PQS in the culture super-
natants,  whereas P. aeruginosa growth was only moderately 
affected.  The  osmotic  stress  effect  on  C4-HSL  was  however 
more  dramatic  in  PLM63  [23]  than  in  PPGAS,  since  this 
HSL  was  still  produced  in  the  latter  medium  containing  0.5 
M  NaCl.  This  can  be  correlated  to  the rhlI  expression  level, 
which  was  more  strongly  impaired  by  osmotic  stress  in 
PLM63  (14  fold  reduced  [23])  than  in  PPGAS  (4.3  fold  
reduced). Furthermore, we investigated here gene expression 
levels  of  pqsABCD  encoding  HHQ  synthesis  enzymes,  and 
pqsH encoding the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 
HHQ  to  PQS  [11,  12,  14].  While  pqsABCDE  mRNA  level 
was  not  decreased,  the  pqsH  expression  level  was  2  fold 
lower  in  the  presence  of  NaCl.  This  lower  pqsH  expression 
level  might  however  not  be  sufficient  to  fully  explain  the 
lack of conversion of HHQ to PQS. In addition, it is possible 
that  the  activity  of  the  PqsH  enzyme  might  be  more  altered 
by  osmotic  stress  than  HHQ  biosynthesis  enzymes,  which 
could  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  PqsH  is  permanently  
exposed to the damaging effects of the external salt [25], due 
to it predicted periplasmic location [15]. As in  PLM63 [23], 
NaCl abolished rhamnolipid production in PPGAS. This is at 
least in part due to the observed reduction of rhlAB and rhlC 
expressions (respectively 4 and 7 fold  in PLM63/NaCl [23]; 
and 6.7  and 10 fold  in PPGAS/NaCl compared  to  the  corre-
sponding  NaCl-free  media),  which  can  in  turn  be  explained 
by  the  lower  C4-HSL  and  PQS  accumulation.  However,  the 
addition  of  exogenous  C4-HSL  or  PQS  to  the  PPGAS/NaCl 
cultures, either at the beginning of the culture or at the end of 
the  exponential  growth  phase,  did  not  allow  rhamnolipid 
production  (data  not  shown),  indicating  that  hyperosmotic 
stress  acts  also  downstream  of  signal  molecules  production 
to  prevent  rhamnolipid  synthesis,  as  previously  suggested 
[23]. 

  P.  aeruginosa  PAO1  adapted  to  0.5  M  NaCl  in  PPGAS 
by accumulating the K+ counter-ion glutamate, NAGGN, and 
trehalose, as previously observed in minimal media [26, 28]. 
By  contrast,  when  GB  was  added  to  the  culture  medium,  it 
was  the  main  accumulated  osmoprotectant  although  this  did 
not  improve  growth.  GB  degradation  by  P.  aeruginosa 
PAO1  was  shown  to  depend  on  the  carbon  source:  it  
occurred  in  M63 glucose medium, but not  in  M63 succinate 
[28].  Since  glucose  is  the  carbon  source  in  PPGAS,  we  
expected  that  GB  would  be  metabolized  by  P.  aeruginosa. 
This  did  not  occur,  suggesting  that  another  component  of  
this  medium  exerts  a  catabolite  repression  preventing  
GB  degradation.  Whereas  it  had  no  effect  on  growth,  GB 
partially or fully reestablished all the observed defects: time-
courses  and  levels  of  production  of  HSLs  and  PQS,  mRNA 
amounts, and rhamnolipid biosynthesis. By contrast, GB had 
no  effect  on  the  rhamnolipid  production  level  when  PPGAS 

Bazire et al. 

did not contain NaCl (not shown). Not all of GB effects were 
previously  observed  in  PLM63/NaCl,  since  GB  failed  to 
restore  the  3OC12-HSL  production  and  the  rhlAB  mRNA 
amount in the latter medium [23].  

 
In  conclusion,  this  work  shows  that  a  hyperosmotic  
condition  which  has  a  moderate  effect  on  P.  aeruginosa 
growth  nevertheless  impairs  the  accumulation  of  cell-to-cell 
signal  molecules  of  HSL  type  and  PQS,  but  not  of  HHQ. 
Since  QS-controlled  phenotypes 
include  production  of  
multiple  virulence  factors,  swarming  and  twitching  motil-
ities,  and  biofilm  formation  [4,  8,  10],  hyperosmotic  condi-
tion is likely to deeply affect the behavior of this bacterium, 
in agreement to a previous report showing that hyperosmotic 
condition  inhibited  biofilm  development  [37].  Rhamnolipid 
production  is  abolished  by  hyperosmotic  condition,  which 
cannot  be  only  explained  by  the  C4-HSL  and  PQS  defects. 
GB,  but  not  the  other  compatible  solutes  accumulated  in  
the  absence  of  GB,  is  able  to  restore  at  least  partially  these 
defects  without  improving  growth,  confirming  previous  
results proposing GB as a chemical chaperonine [38].
