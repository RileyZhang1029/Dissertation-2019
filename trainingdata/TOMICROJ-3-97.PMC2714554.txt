Abstract:  16S  rDNA  sequence  analysis  is  the  most  accurate  method  for  definitive  species  identification  of  nocardiae. 
However,  conflicting  results  can  be  found  due  to  sequence  errors  in  gene  databases.  This  study  tested  the  feasibility  of 
species  identification  of  Nocardia  by  partial  (5’-end  606-bp)  16S  rDNA  sequencing,  based  on  sequence  comparison  
with “reference” sequences of well-annotated strains. This new approach was evaluated using 96 American Type Culture 
Collection  (n=6),  and  clinical  (n=90)  Nocardia  isolates.  Nucleotide  sequence-based  polymorphisms  within  species  were 
indicative  of  “sequence  types”  for  that  species.  Sequences  were  compared  with  those  in  the  GenBank,  Bioinformatics 
Bacteria  Identification  and  Ribosomal  Database  Project  databases.  Compared  with  the  reference  sequence  set,  all  96  
isolates were correctly  identified using the criterion of  (cid:1)99% sequence similarity. Seventy-eight (81.3%) were speciated 
by database comparison; alignment with reference sequences resolved the identity of 14 (15%) isolates whose sequences 
yielded  100%  similarity  to  sequences  in  GenBank  under  >1  species  designation.  Of  90  clinical  isolates,  the  commonest 
species  was  Nocardia  nova  (33.3%)  followed  by  Nocardia  cyriacigeorgica  (26.7%).  Recently-described  or  uncommon 
species included Nocardia veterana (4.4%), Nocarida bejingensis (2.2%) and, Nocardia abscessus and Nocardia arthriditis 
(each  n=1).  Nocardia  asteroides  sensu  stricto  was  rare  (n=1).  There  were  nine  sequence  types  of  N.  nova,  three  of  
Nocardia  brasiliensis  with  two  each  of  N.  cyriacigeorgica  and  Nocardia  farcinica.  Thirteen  novel  sequences  were  
identified.  Alignment  of  sequences  with  reference  sequences  facilitated  species  identification  of  Nocardia  and  allowed  
delineation  of  sequence  types  within  species,  suggesting  that  such  a  barcoding  approach  can  be  clinically  useful  for  
identification of bacteria.

INTRODUCTION  

  Nocardia  species  cause  a  range  of  infections  including 
localised lung and skin infections, and disseminated disease. 
Speciation  of  clinical  isolates  is  important  to  characterise 
associated  disease  manifestations,  predict  antimicrobial  
susceptibility  and  identify  differences 
in  epidemiology  
[1].  Since  standard  phenotypic  identification  methods  are 
time-consuming  and  often  imprecise  [2,  3],  nucleic  acid-
amplification  tools  targeting  conserved  gene  regions  have 
been developed to facilitate accurate species determination.  

  Of  these,  16S  rDNA  sequence  analysis  is  the  most  
frequently-used  method  for  definitive  species  identification 
of  nocardiae  [2,  4-6].  Polymorphisms  within  the  65-kDa  
heat  shock  protein  gene  (hsp65)  target  are  also  reported  to 
enable speciation [7, 8]. These sequence-based identification

methods have led to substantial species re-assignment within 
the  genus,  especially  among  “Nocardia  asteroides”  isolates. 
Over  80  species  have  now  been  described  of  which  at  least 
33  have  been  implicated  in  human  disease  (http://www. 
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/;  http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/n/ 
nocardia.html; [2]).  

  Numerous  Nocardia  16S  rDNA  sequences  have  thus 
been  deposited  in  public  sequence  databases;  however,  
a  substantial  proportion  of  sequences,  for  example  in  
GenBank,  represents  misidentified 
isolates  or  contains  
significant  errors  [9,  10].  Imprecise  species  identification 
may  also  result  from  the  presence  of  multiple,  but  different, 
copies  of  16S  rDNA  in  certain  Nocardia  spp.  such  as  
Nocardia  nova  [11].  Further,  sequence-based  analyses  
are  complicated  by  the  lack  of  consensus  regarding  the  
degree  of  sequence  similarity  required  for  species  definition 
of Nocardia [12]. 

  To  improve  sequence-based  species  identification,  there 
has  been  strong  impetus  to  develop  libraries  of  DNA  
sequences  in  order  to  designate,  or  link,  standardised  
sequences, including nucleotide polymorphisms within these

sequences,  with  a  particular  species;  this  process  requires  
the  establishment  of  such  “reference  sequences”  or  “DNA 
barcodes”  for  species  identification  and  for  the  recognition 
of intraspecies sequence polymorphisms or “sequence types” 
[13,  14].  Such  an  approach  has  not  yet  been  applied  to  the 
identification of Nocardia. Since the few molecular analyses 
of  Nocardia  culture  collections  have  reported  significant 
species  misidentification  using  phenotypic  methods  [5,  15], 
we  re-examined  the  species  identity  of  96 Nocardia  isolates 
in  our  collection  using  partial  (5’-end  606-bp)  16S  rDNA  
sequencing  and  the  assignment  of  sequence  types.  The  
accuracy  of  three  publicly-available  gene  databases  for  
species identification was compared.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Nocardia Organisms 

  Ninety-six  Nocardia 
isolates  were  studied  (supple- 
mentary  Table  S1;  Table  1).  These  comprised  six  American 
Type  Culture  Collection  (ATCC;  Rockville,  MD)  strains  
(N.  asteroides  ATCC  19247T,  Nocardia  farcinica  ATCC 
3308,  N.  farcinica  ATCC  3318T,  N.  nova  ATCC  33726T, 
Nocardia  otitidiscaviarum  ATCC  14629T  and  Nocardia 
paucivorans  ATCC  BAA-278T)  and  90  clinical  isolates 
(from 
the  Clinical  Mycology  Laboratory,  Centre  for  
Infectious  Diseases  and  Microbiology,  Westmead  Hospital, 
Sydney,  Australia).  Clinical  isolates  were  cultured  from 
separate  patients 
isolates  were  
speciated  using  standard  phenotypic  methods  and  antibiotic 
susceptibility  profiles  [3]  and,  by  16S  rDNA  sequencing.

Kong et al. 

Isolates  were  cultured  aerobically  in  brain  heart  infusion 
broth  (Amyl  Media,  Dandenong,  Australia)  for  3-15  days  
at 37oC.  

DNA Extraction  

  Cells  from  2 ml-brain  heart  infusion  broth  cultures  of 
Nocardia  in  late  logarithmic  phase  were  harvested  by  cen-
trifugation  at  14,000  X  g  for  10 min.  The  supernatant  was 
removed  and  the  pellet  suspended  in  150  μl  of  digestion 
buffer  (10  mM  Tris-HCl  [pH  8.0],  0.45%  Triton  X-100  and 
0.45%  Tween  20).  Bacterial  suspensions  were  then  heated 
for  10  min  at  100oC  to  lyse  the  cells,  followed  by  cooling  
at -20oC for 1 h. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 X g 
for  5  min  to  pellet  the  cell  debris.  Supernatants  containing 
DNA  were  diluted  in  350  μl  TE  buffer  (5mM  Tris  HCl,  0.5 
mM EDTA) and centrifuged for 2 min to remove cell debris. 
DNA  was  quantitated  using  a  spectrophotometer  and  stored 
at –20oC until required. 

PCR Amplification and Sequencing of the 16S rDNA 

  The  5’-end  606-bp  fragment  of  the  16S  rDNA  gene  was 
amplified  using  the  universal  bacterial  primers  16S-27f0  
(5’  to  3’:  1  TTA  GAG  TTT  TGA  TCM  TGG  CTC  21)  and 
16S-907r (5’  to  3’:  986  CCG  TCA  ATT  CMT  TRA  GTT  T 
877) [16]. Each PCR reaction contained 5 (cid:2)l template DNA, 
0.25  (cid:2)l  (50  pmol/(cid:2)l)  each  of  forward  primer  and  reverse 
primer,  1.25  (cid:2)l  dNTPs  (2.5  mM  of  each  dNTP:  Roche  
Diagnostics,  Mannheim,  Germany),  2.5  (cid:2)l  10x  PCR  buffer 
(Qiagen,  Donacaster,  Victoria),  0.1  (cid:2)l  HotStar  Taq  polym-
erase (5 U/(cid:2)l) and water to a 25 (cid:2)l final volume. Amplifica-

(Eppendorf;  Netheler-Hinz  GmbH,  Germany).  The  cycling 
conditions  were:  95°C  for  15  min  followed  by  35  cycles  
of  94°C  for  30  s,  55°C  for  30  s,  72°C  for  90  s  with  a  final 
extension step at 72°C for 10 min.

sequenced  using  the  BigDye  Terminator  version  3.1  cycle 
sequencing kit (ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyser; Applied 
Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA)  and  the  primer  16S-27f  (5’  to 
3’:  3  AGA  GTT  TTG  ATC  MTG  GCT  CAA  G  23)  [16]. 
Each sequence was manually aligned and analysed to ensure 
high quality sequence data. Where the sequence of an isolate 
differed  from  the  GenBank  “reference”  sequence  for  that 
species  (see  Results  and  Table  2),  [7,  17,  18]  or  for  novel 
sequences, additional primers (16S-27f0 and 16S-907r) were 
used to confirm the result of the sequence.  

16S rDNA Sequence Analysis 

For  each  isolate,  the  amplified  5’-606  bp  16S  rDNA 
 
fragment  was  examined  using  the  BioManager  facility 
(ANGIS,  Sydney;  http://biomanager.angis.org.au/).  Consen-
sus sequences were constructed from alignments of sequence 
data  using  ClustalW  [19]  after  careful  examination  of  each 
electrophoregram trace representation of data. Sequence data 
were  queried  against  archived  sequences  in  the  GenBank 
(BLASTn  2.2.10;  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov),  Bioinfor-
matics  Bacteria  Identification  (BIBI)  version  0.2  (http:// 
umr5558-sud-str1.univ-lyon1.fr/lebibi/lebibi.cgi;  [20])  and 
Ribosomal  Database  Project-II  (RDP-II)  version  9.54 
(http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/index.jsp; [21]) databases. 

  A  list  of  the  closest  sequence  matches  was  generated 
from  the  database  comparisons  with  pair-wise  distance 
scores indicating the percent similarity between the unknown 
(query)  sequence  and  database  sequences.  Only  consensus 
sequences with a  minimum length of 606-bp were analysed. 
A  percent  similarity  (or  identity)  score  of  (cid:1)  99%  [4,  5]  was 
used  as  the  criterion  to  classify  an  isolate  to  species  level 
whilst  a  97  to  98.9%  similarity  score  identified  an  isolate  
as belonging to the genus Nocardia but to a different species 
[9, 10]. 

Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number 

  Thirty-four  606  bp  partial  16S  rDNA  sequences  includ-
ing  13  novel  Nocardia  sequences  generated  in  the  study 
were  deposited  in  GenBank  with  the  following  accession 
numbers (also see Table 3): FJ172101 through to FJ172134. 

RESULTS  

Establishment of a Reference Set of 16S rDNA Sequences 

For  this  study,  the  606-bp  16S  rDNA  sequences  of  43 
 
well-characterised  isolates  representing  43  taxonomically-
authenticated  Nocardia  species  (http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/ 
n/nocardia.html)  were  chosen  as  the  reference  sequences  
for that species; these isolates were previously-characterised 
by  both  16S  rRNA  and  hsp65  gene  analyses  [7,  8].  The  
sequences  of  two  additional  isolates,  Nocardia  elegans  
DSM  44890T  and  Nocardia  aobensis  IFM  0137  [17,  18], 
were  included  in  the  reference  sequence  set  (Table  2).  
Examination  of  the  N.  asteroides  ATCC  14759  sequence  
 

(N.  asteroides  type  VI,  GenBank  accession  no.  DQ223862) 
found  it  to  be  identical  to  that  of  Nocardia  cyriacigeorgica 
DSM  44484T  (GenBank  accession  no.  AY756550).  The  
sequence  of  Nocardia  beijingensis  JCM  10666T  (GenBank 
accession  no.  AY756543)  reported  in  one  study  [6,  7]  
was  98.5%  similar  to  that  of  this  same  strain  (GenBank  
accession no. DQ659901) described in a separate study [17]. 
We  assigned  the  sequence  corresponding  to  accession  no. 
DQ659901  as  the  reference  sequence  for  N.  beijingensis 
since  this  yielded  the  higher  similarity  (100%)  to  multiple  
N. beijingensis sequences in the GenBank, BIBI and RDP-II 
databases.  

  This collection of partial 16S rDNA sequences represent-
ing  45  Nocardia  species  formed  the  basis  for  re-evaluating 
the  species  identity  of  the  study  isolates  and  was  important  
in  the  validation  of  the  sequence  analyses.  Strains  fulfilling 
the  criterion  for  a  species  ((cid:1)99%  sequence  similarity)  but 
which  demonstrated  sequence  polymorphisms  compared  to 
the  reference  sequence  for  that  species  were  considered  as 
separate sequence types for the species.  

16S  rDNA  Sequence-Based  Identification  of  Nocardia 
Isolates 

  The  details  of  96 Nocardia  isolates  identified  by  pheno-
typic methods and partial 16S rDNA sequencing are given in 
supplementary Table S1. The species distribution of isolates, 
as  determined  by  sequence  comparison  with  the  reference 
sequence set,  and with sequences  in the GenBank,  BIBI and 
RDP-II databases, is shown in Table 1.  

(a)  Identification  Based  on  Comparison  with  Reference 
606-bp 16S rDNA Sequences  

 
Following alignment of sequence data with  the reference 
sequence set, partial 16S rDNA sequencing provided species 
identification  for  all  96  isolates  using  a  criterion  of  (cid:1)99% 
sequence  similarity  for  species  definition;  83  (86.5%)  
isolates  were  identified  if  a  criterion  of  100%  sequence  
similarity was used.  

  Of  90  clinical  isolates,  phenotypic  methods  correctly 
identified  42  (46.7%)  strains  to  species  level  (Table  1;  
supplementary Table S1). Thirty-four isolates were  assigned 
a  phenotypic  identification  of  N.  asteroides/N.  asteroides 
complex  based  on  their  drug  susceptibility  pattern  but  
16S  rDNA  sequencing  recognised  them  as  a  number  
of  distinct  species  e.g.  N.  cyriacigeorgica,  N.  farcinica  and 
N.  paucivorans  among  others  (Supplementary  Table  S1). 
Molecular  and  phenotypic  species  identification  methods 
were  concordant  for  80%  (8  of  10),  75%  (three  of  four),  
90%  (27  of  30)  and  100%  (all  of  three)  of  N.  farcinica,  
N. otitidiscavarium, N. nova and Nocardia brasiliensis clini-
cal 
N.  paucivorans  isolates  were  correctly  identified  by  pheno-
typic  methods.  All  six  ATCC  strains  were  assigned  by  16S 
rDNA sequencing to their respective species (Supplementary

only  one  of  35  phenotypic  “N.  asteroides/N.  asteroides  
complex”  isolates  (other  than  strain  ATCC  19247T)  had  
a  sequence  identical  to  sequences  of  N.  asteroides  sensu

4Different  sequence  results  obtained for  N.  beijingensis  JCM  10666T  in  two  separate studies.  The  sequence  with  GenBank accession  no.  DQ659901  is  chosen  as  the reference  se-
quence.  
5The sequence of N. cyriacigeorgica strain DSM 44490T (GenBank accession no. AY756550) is identical to the sequence of N. asteroides ATCC 14759 (accession no. DQ223862).  
6 The sequence is based on a 603-bp 16S rDNA fragment.  

stricto  (represented  by  N.  asteroides  ATCC  19247T);  22 
clinical  isolates  had  sequences  with  100%  similarity  to  the 
reference  N.  cyriacigeorgica  sequence.  The  remaining 
strains were N. paucivorans (n=3),  N. nova (n=2),  N. beijin-
gensis (n=2), Nocardia abscessus (n=1), Nocardia arthritidis 
(n=1),  N.  farcinica  (n=1)  and  Nocardia  veterana  (n=1). 
Other  discrepant  results  included  two  N.  farcinica  (pheno-
typic  identification)  isolates  yielding  sequences  with  100% 
similarity  to  the  reference  N.  cyriacigeorgica  sequence  and  
a  N.  brasiliensis  strain  with  100%  sequence  similarity  to  
N. otitidiscavarium. 

  Eleven  isolates  (supplementary  Table  S1)  identified  as 
“Nocardia  spp.”  by  phenotypic  methods  were  identified  as 
N.  paucivorans  (n=3),  N.  farcinica,  N.  veterana  (each  n=2) 
and  N.  aobensis,  N.  nova,  Nocardia  transvalensis  and  
Nocardia vinacea (each n=1).  

Comparison  of  Species  Identification  Using  GenBank, 
BIBI and RDP-II Databases 

 
For  all  isolates,  the  same  species  identification  result  
was obtained by comparison of their sequences with those in 
the  GenBank,  BIBI  and  RDP-II  databases  (Table  1).  The 
distribution  of  percent  similarity  scores  according 
to  
database  is  shown  in  Fig  (1).  Using  the  criterion  of  (cid:1)99% 
sequence  similarity  for  species  designation,  all  96  isolates 
were  identified  by  the  GenBank  and  BIBI  databases  and  91 
(96.7%),  by  the  RDP-II  system.  The  length  of  sequences 
employed  for  sequence  alignment  in  the  BIBI,  RDP-II  and 
GenBank  databases  ranged  from  512-548  bp,  572-590  bp 
and (cid:1)606 bp, respectively. Perfect matches (100% similarity) 
were  observed  for  77%,  79%  and  93%  of  sequence  align-
ments  against  the  GenBank,  BIBI  and  RDP-II  databases, 
respectively (Fig. 1).  

b) Species Identification Based on BLASTn Alignments 

Species Distribution of Clinical Isolates 

 
Isolates were  also  identified  to species level by compari-
son  with  database  sequences  with  the  following  exceptions: 
firstly,  N.  farcinica  could  not  be  definitively  speciated;  all  
13  strains  (100%  sequence  similarity  to  the  reference  
N.  farcinica  sequence)  were  identified  as  either N.  farcinica 
or  N.  otitidiscavarium  (Table  1).  The  three  databases  
contained  a  sequence  corresponding  to  N.  otitidiscavarium 
strain  DSM  43242T  (GenBank  accession  no.  X80611).  This 
sequence  was  indistinguishable  from  N.  farcinica  sequences 
but  only  had  94.7%  similarity  to  the  reference  sequence  of  
N.  otitidiscavarium  (GenBank  accession  no.  AY756556). 
Secondly,  a  phenotypic  N.  asteroides  isolate  was  identified 
as  N.  asteroides/N.  abscessus/Nocardia  asiatica  (Table  1). 
Since its sequence was identical to the reference sequence of 
N.  abscessus,  it  was  assigned  as  such.  The  reference  16S 
rDNA  sequences  of  N.  abscessus  and  N.  asiatica  (Table  2) 
differ  only  by  a  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  at 
position 527 (“G” for  N. abscessus but “C” for  N. asiatica). 
Finally, an isolate (strain 01-320-2714; supplementary Table 
S1)  was  identified  as  N.  beijingensis  by  database  compari-
sons  (99.6%  sequence  similarity  to  a  single  N.  bejingensis 
sequence;  GenBank  accession  no.  AY756543).  However,  
as  it  yielded  99%  sequence  similarity  (5-bp  difference)  to  
the  reference  sequence  of  N.  arthriditis,  it  was  assigned  as  
N. arthriditis (Table 1). 

 
Fourteen  Nocardia  species  were  identified  amongst  90 
isolates,  the  most  common being N. nova (30 isolates; 33%) 
followed  by  N.  cyriacigeorgica  (n=24;  27%),  N.  farcinica 
(n=11; 12%) and N. paucivorans (n=6; 7%). There were four 
isolates  each  of  N.  otitidiscaviarum  and  N.  veterana,  three 
strains of N. brasiliensis, two of N. beijingensis and one each 
of  N.  asteroides  sensu  stricto,  N.  transvalensis,  N.  vinacea, 
N. aobensis, N. arthritidis and N. abscessus.  

Intra-Species  Variation  and  Sequence  Types  of  Clinical 
Isolates 

Partial  16S  rRNA  sequences  of  N.  veterana,  N.  absces-

 
sus,  N.  beijingensis  and  N.  vinacea  isolates  were  identical  
to  the  reference  sequence  for  that  species,  thus  there  was  a 
single  sequence  type.  Intraspecies  sequence  heterogeneity 
was  evident  in  the  remaining  10  species,  and  varied  with 
species  (Table  3).  The  largest  number  of  sequence  types, 
including that identical to the reference sequence, was noted 
for N. nova (nine sequence types) followed by N. brasiliensis 
(three  sequence  types).  N.  cyriacigeorgica,  N.  farcinica,  
N. asteroides sensu stricto  and N. otitidiscavarium exhibited 
two  sequence  types.  The  sequences  of  three  N.  cyriacigeor-
gica  isolates  (indistinguishable  from  one  another)  differed 
from  the  reference  N.  cyriacigeorgica  sequence  by  a  SNP  
at  position  576  (substitution  of  “A”  for  “G”,  see  Table  3).

There  was  only  one  sequence  type  for  N.  aobensis,  
N.  transvalensis,  N.  arthritidis  and  N.  paucivorans  but  the 
sequences  of  these  isolates  all  demonstrated  SNPs  when 
compared to the reference sequence for the species (Table 3). 
Thirteen  novel  Nocardia  sequences  were  identified  for  15 
isolates (eight species). 

DISCUSSION  

  Molecular-based  identification  of  Nocardia  spp.  remains 
a challenge due  to the  increasing recognition of new species 
and  changes  in  taxonomy  [22].  Sequence  analysis  of  the  
16S  rDNA  is  the  current  gold  standard  for  identification  
of  Nocardia  spp.  However  few  studies  have  explored  the

validity  of  sequence-based  identification  approaches  using 
collections  of  phenotypically-characterised  clinical  isolates 
[9]. The present study proposes, and has tested the utility of 
a  set  of  reliable  reference  Nocardia  16S  rDNA  sequences, 
derived  from  authoritatively–identified  organisms  [7,  17],  
as  sequence  standards  for  species  identification.  Further,  by 
identifying  and  assigning  sequence  types  to  represent  
sequence  polymorphisms  within  a  species,  the  results  have 
identified  that  such  a  “barcoding”  approach  can  improve 
systematic and  accurate species identification. DNA barcod-
ing  has  been  designed  to  provide  rapid  accurate  species  
identification  by  using  short,  standardised  gene  regions  
(in  this  case,  the  5’-end  16S  rDNA  region)  as  internal  
species  tags [14]. Although it has been found to be effective 
in  speciating  eukaryote  organisms  and  some  parasites  
[13, 14, 16], there are few data on its application in the iden-
tification of bacterial pathogens.  

  As  such,  based  on  comparison  with  the  reference  
sequence  set,  partial  16S  rDNA  sequencing  provided  clear 
species  identification  of  all  96  isolates.  In  particular,  the  
reference  sequence  set  was  useful  in  the  speciation  of  11 
isolates identified only to genus level by phenotypic methods 
and  assisted  in  resolving  the  identity  of  14  (15%)  clinically 
relevant  isolates  whose  sequences  aligned  with  100%  
similarity to sequences assigned to more  than one species  in 
the GenBank, BIBI and RDP-II databases (Table 1). Without 
the  resource  of  this  sequence  set,  sequencing  was  unable  
to  assign  precise  species  identification  to  13  N.  farcinica 
isolates  (Table  1).  It  is  most  likely  that  the  N.  otitisdis-
cavarium  DSM  43242T  sequence  (GenBank  accession  
no.  X80611)  with  100%  identity  to  N.  farcinica  sequences 
represents  a  misidentification,  underscoring  the  importance 
of  adequate  stewardship  of  database  sequences.  Of  note,  
the  reference  sequence  of  N.  abscessus  and  N.  asiatica  
(GenBank accession nos. AY544980 and AY903617, respec-
tively) differ only by a SNP - this low interspecies heteroge-
neity  likely  explains  the  inability  to  resolve  species  identifi-

cation  for  N.  abscessus  after  alignment  with  databases  
sequences  (Table  3).  N.  abscessus  (previously  N.  asteroides 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  type  I)  represents  (cid:2)20%  of  
isolates  of  the  former  N.  asteroides  complex;  accurate  
species  identification  is  important  as  MICs  of  imipenem, 
which  is  commonly  used  to  treat  nocardiosis,  are  high  for 
this species [2]. There are few descriptions of N. asiatica  as 
a pathogen.  

Species  identification  of  Nocardia  by  gene  sequence 
 
analysis is heavily reliant on the entries in the gene reposito-
ries  being  queried  [10,  23].  As  noted  in  the  present  study, 
inappropriate and /or obsolete sequence entries are important 
potential  limitations.  Further,  species  identification  based  
on  data  derived  from  a  single  or  small  numbers  of  strains 
representing  a  species  must  be  interpreted  with  caution  
(see  also  Table  1).  As  such,  the  submission  of  carefully-
annotated  new  sequences  is  critical  to  maintaining  the  
accuracy  of  current  gene  repositories.  Since  the  BIBI  and 
RDP-II  systems  contain  a  larger  proportion  of  shorter  16S 
rDNA  sequences  (512-548  bp,  572-590  bp,  respectively  
vs.  (cid:1)606  bp  in  GenBank),  this  may  have  resulted  in  an  
artificially  inflated  number  of  perfect  sequence  matches  
(Fig.  1).  The  validity  of  comparisons  with  sequences  of  
different  lengths  for  species  identification  requires  further 
study.  

  The  approach  undertaken  in  this  study  has  further  
allowed  us  to  distinguish  between  closely-related  Nocardia 
species,  to  identify  newly  described  or  uncommon  species 
and to determine the species distribution of clinical Nocardia 
isolates received in our laboratory. Elsewhere and in Austra-
lia,  most  human  infections  historically  have  been  attributed 
to  N.  asteriodes  sensu  stricto  antimicrobial  susceptibility 
class types I and VI, N. nova, N. brasiliensis and N. farcinica 
[1, 24]. Our results reconfirm that this generally remains the 
case. Given the prevalence of N. cyriacigeorgica (previously 
N. asteroides type VI as a pathogen (this study; [25]), adop-

tion  of  protocols  by  microbiology  laboratories  for  its  identi-
fication is important. Apart from distinguishing N. abscessus 
from  N.  asiatica  (see  above),  partial  16S  rDNA  sequencing 
was  able  to  differentiate  between  other  closely-related  
species  including  N.  veterana  and  N.  nova  sensu  stricto  
(sequence similarity of 98.1%; [6, 26, 27]). Classified within 
the  N.  nova  complex,  N.  veterana  is  an  emerging  pathogen 
capable  of  causing  serious  infection  [27].  Of  note,  the

taxonomic  groups  questions 

 
Importantly,  the results  identified significant  intraspecies 
sequence  polymorphisms  within  the  16S  rDNA  for  many  
(10  of  14)  Nocardia  species  or  for  seven  of  nine  species  
represented by more than one strain (Table 3), and that such 
nucleotide heterogeneity differed according to species, being 
most  evident  for  N.  nova  (nine  sequence  types).  Although 
there  was  no  genetic  heterogeneity  amongst  isolates  of,  for 
example, N.  farcinica,  the  sequences  of  the  isolates  differed 
from  the  reference  sequence  for  this  species.  Thus,  if  
constructing a DNA template or  “identification barcode” for 
identifying  Australian  N.  paucivorans  isolates,  16S  rDNA 
position 33 should incorporate an extra C and at position 37, 
an  extra  G  in  relation  to  the  reference  sequence  (Table  3).  
In  the  USA,  three  “genetic  types”  of  N.  cyriacigeorgica  
with  SNPs  at  positions  448,  1427  and  1480  [25]  have  been 
reported;  we  identified  a  SNP  at  position  576  but  not  at  
position 448. Thus, comparison of sequence types of isolates 
from  different  countries  to  identify  potential  clinical  and 
epidemiological  associations  may  be  warranted.  As  noted  
for  other  bacteria,  substitutions  of  as  little  as  1-2  bp  may 
correlate  with  unique  Nocardia  phenotypes  and  clinical  
significance  [5,  28].  Therefore,  documentation  of  sequence 
polymorphisms  within  species  is  relevant  to  delimiting  
species  or  highlighting  genetically-distinct  groups  with  
levels  of  sequence  divergence  that  are  either  suggestive  or 
exclusive of species status.  

 
Finally, 13 novel sequences from eight Nocardia  species 
were  identified  and  some  of  them  may  merit  description  
as  new  species  (Table  3).  Species  designation,  however,  is 
confounded  by  the  lack  of  a  consensus  criterion  for  species 
definition  based  on  percent  similarity  scores;  isolates  of  
distinct species of Nocardia have been reported to exhibit as 
much as 99.8% sequence similarity [12].  

CONCLUSION 

 
Partial  16S  rDNA  sequencing  is  a  viable  alternative  to 
full-length sequencing for species identification of Nocardia 
in  a  diagnostic  laboratory.  The  present  approach  encom-
passed  comparison of the sequence of interest with  a library 
of  reference  sequences  and  the  assigning  of  sequence  types 
to  represent  sequence  polymorphisms  within  species,  based 
on  sequence  similarity  to  the  reference  sequence  for  that 
species; unambiguous species identification was obtained for 
all study isolates. As affirmed  in  the present study, errors  in 
sequence  entries  remain  important  potential  limitations  of 
public gene repositories [6, 10, 23]. The results of  the study 
suggest  that  a  barcoding  approach  [29,  30]  can  assist  with 
species identification of clinically relevant Nocardia. Further 
studies  are  warranted  to  explore  its  wider  application  in  

Kong et al. 

improving  species  differentiation  and  unravelling  sequence 
data for phylogenetically-unresolved groups of bacteria.
