The elemental composition of phytoplankton can depart from canonical Redﬁeld values
under conditions of nutrient limitation or production (e.g., N ﬁxation). Similarly, the trace
metal metallome of phytoplankton may be expected to vary as a function of both ambient
nutrient concentrations and the biochemical processes of the cell. Diazotrophs such as
the colonial cyanobacteria Trichodesmium are likely to have unique metal signatures due
to their cell physiology. We present metal (Fe, V, Zn, Ni, Mo, Mn, Cu, Cd) quotas for Tri-
chodesmium collected from the Sargasso Sea which highlight the unique metallome of
this organism. The element concentrations of bulk colonies and trichomes sections were
analyzed by ICP-MS and synchrotron x-ray ﬂuorescence, respectively. The cells were char-
acterized by low P contents but enrichment in V, Fe, Mo, Ni, and Zn in comparison to
other phytoplankton. Vanadium was the most abundant metal in Trichodesmium, and the
V quota was up to fourfold higher than the corresponding Fe quota. The stoichiometry of
600C:101N:1P (mol mol−1) reﬂects P-limiting conditions. Iron and V were enriched in con-
tiguous cells of 10 and 50% of Trichodesmium trichomes, respectively. The distribution of
Ni differed from other elements, with the highest concentration in the transverse walls
between attached cells. We hypothesize that the enrichments of V, Fe, Mo, and Ni are
linked to the biochemical requirements for N ﬁxation either directly through enrichment in
the N-ﬁxing enzyme nitrogenase or indirectly by the expression of enzymes responsible
for the removal of reactive oxygen species. Unintentional uptake of V via P pathways may
also be occurring. Overall, the cellular content of trace metals and macronutrients differs
signiﬁcantly from the (extended) Redﬁeld ratio. The Trichodesmium metallome is an exam-
ple of how physiology and environmental conditions can cause signiﬁcant deviations from
the idealized stoichiometry.

INTRODUCTION
The biogeochemical cycling of many trace metals is controlled,
to a large degree, by their incorporation into plankton biomass
in surface waters and remineralization from degrading plank-
ton at depth. This linkage was proposed for macronutrients by
Redﬁeld (Redﬁeld, 1934, 1958; Redﬁeld et al., 1963), and more
recent studies have expanded the concept to metals (Morel and
Hudson, 1985; Bruland et al., 1991; Ho et al., 2003). Indeed, the
molar stoichiometry of particulate C:N:P in surface waters has
been observed to be strikingly similar to stoichiometries of dis-
solved CO2:nitrate:phosphate in deep ocean seawater (Sverdrup
et al., 1942; Takahashi et al., 1985; Körtzinger et al., 2001). Sim-
ilar relationships can be observed for trace metals, although the
comparisons break down for metals with signiﬁcant lithogenic
inputs, redox transformations, or scavenging behavior (Morel,
2008). Despite the relative constancy of average C:N:P in the
ocean, macronutrient ratios in speciﬁc ocean regions and speciﬁc
phytoplankton groups depart signiﬁcantly from the Redﬁeld ratio
(Sverdrup et al., 1942; Geider and La Roche, 2002; Arrigo, 2005).

Similarly, although bulk plankton communities are often charac-
terized by a fairly consistent metal stoichiometry (Bruland et al.,
1991; Ho, 2006), individual species and taxonomic groups can vary
signiﬁcantly in their metal stoichiometries (or quotas), even when
grown under the same conditions (Ho et al., 2003; Twining et al.,
2004, 2011).

The elemental composition of phytoplankton can depart from
canonical Redﬁeld values under conditions of nutrient limitation
or production (e.g., N ﬁxation). The diazotrophic cyanobacterium
Trichodesmium has signiﬁcantly elevated N contents, relative to P,
when ﬁxing N (White et al., 2006), and blooms of Trichodesmium
can signiﬁcantly alter the major nutrient stoichiometry of par-
ticular matter in surface waters of the ocean (Karl et al., 1992).
Phytoplankton also vary their major nutrient stoichiometry under
P-limiting conditions (Sterner and Elser, 2002; Ji and Sherrell,
2008), which may be encountered by Trichodesmium in the ocean
(Sañudo-Wilhelmy et al., 2001). Macronutrient limitation can also
result in altered trace metal stoichiometries as cells adjust their bio-
chemical machinery to deal with changing nutrient supplies. For

The biogeochemical signature of Trichodesmium

example, cells require more Fe, Ni, and Zn to grow on nitrate, urea,
and organic P, respectively, because of the biochemical composi-
tion of the metalloenzymes nitrate reductase, urease, and alkaline
phosphatase (Price and Morel, 1991; Maldonado and Price, 1996;
Ji and Sherrell, 2008). Additionally, taxonomic groups can vary
in their metal response to identical macronutrient stresses (Ji and
Sherrell, 2008).

Similarly, diazotrophs such as Trichodesmium are likely to have
unique metal signatures due to their cell physiology. The met-
alloenzyme nitrogenase contains at least 38 atoms of Fe per
holozyme (Whittaker et al., 2011). Kustka et al. (2003b) esti-
mated that 19–53% of cellular Fe in Trichodesmium is bound in
nitrogenase. Such presence of Fe-rich enzymes leads consequently
to elevated Fe quotas in comparison to other phytoplankton
(Berman-Frank et al., 2001). Cellular Mo enrichment relative to
non-diazotrophic phytoplankton also likely results from the pres-
ence of a Mo and Fe (MoFe) cofactor of nitrogenase (Dominic
et al., 2000; Tuit et al., 2004). Furthermore, the concomitant
ﬁxation of N and C in Trichodesmium requires an additional
biochemical defense mechanism against reactive oxygen species,
which deactivate the nitrogenase enzyme. The removal of hydro-
gen peroxide or superoxide by enzymes such haloperoxidase and
superoxide dismutase is thus essential for the process of N ﬁxa-
tion (Dupont et al., 2008b; Johnson et al., 2011). These enzymes
have metal co-factors of their own which may be elevated in Tri-
chodesmium, thus imparting to the organism a unique trace metal
stoichiometry.

In this study we present data on the metal contents, or met-
allome (Williams, 2001; Haraguchi, 2004), of Trichodesmium col-
lected from the Sargasso Sea in the western sub-tropical North
Atlantic Ocean. Metal stoichiometries of whole colonies were
determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS), and trichome sections were assayed using synchrotron
x-ray ﬂuorescence (SXRF). In addition to providing indepen-
dent assessment of the elemental content of the organisms, the
micro-analytical analyses allow us to study the spatial allocation
of these elements and probe their sources. Information about the
metallome is then linked to the biology of Trichodesmium and sev-
eral hypotheses are presented regarding the potential biochemical
associations of these trace metals in this organism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE COLLECTION
Trichodesmium samples were collected from the Sargasso Sea in
August 2010 during a cruise to the region aboard the R/V Atlantic
Explorer (Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study cruise 261). Sam-
ples were collected at six different stations at different times of
the day. All stations were within a 13 km radius and were located
within the same mesoscale water mass as indicated by sea sur-
face height anomaly (Figure 1). Thus the stations are interpreted
to represent one geographical location. Trichodesmium colonies
were collected at a depth of ca. 5 m using a 100-μm plankton net
with a PVC frame. Immediately after collection, 15–20 colonies
were transferred using acid-washed polystyrene inoculation loops
from the cod end to Teﬂon vials ﬁlled with Milli-Q water (>
18 MΩ) for subsequent digestion and ICP-MS analysis. In order
to normalize metal quotas to C and N, as well as to P (which is

obtained via ICP-MS), 20–30 colonies were concurrently picked
at each station for CHN analysis and placed into Teﬂon vials ﬁlled
with ﬁltered seawater. Subsequently, colonies for CHN analysis
were ﬁltered onto pre-combusted GF/F ﬁlters, wrapped in alu-
minum foil, and frozen until samples could be dried overnight at
60˚C. Additional samples were transferred from the cod end to two
50-mL centrifuge tubes and amended immediately with cleaned
glutaraldehyde to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5% for preparation of
SXRF samples.

All shipboard handling was carried out using trace metal clean
materials and tools under a laminar ﬂow hood. The elemental
composition of whole colonies was determined using ICP-MS and
CHN analysis (Table 1). Element distributions and concentrations
in individual trichome sections were assessed with SXRF. Speciﬁc
efforts to disaggregate colonies during SXRF sample preparation
were not made, but individual free (i.e., non-overlapping) tri-
chomes were chosen for analysis to enable interpretation of the
resulting 2D element maps. No effort was made to identify or
remove any attached bacteria, eukaryotes, or mineral material
associated with colonies prior to analysis.

BULK ELEMENT ANALYSIS
Trichodesmium colonies were digested in Teﬂon vials prior to ICP-
MS analysis. Vials were ﬁrst cleaned via an overnight soak in 2 M
HCl followed by boiling in aqua regia for 4 h. Vials were then
rinsed ﬁve times with Milli-Q and dried in a class-100 laminar
ﬂow hood. Trichodesmium samples were digested in 6 M Optima
HNO3 at 150ºC for 4 h. This was repeated twice with dry-down in
between. Following digestion, each sample was taken up in 0.6 M
HCl (Optima Grade) and In-115 was added as internal standard.
Elemental contents of samples were more than 40-fold above those
of blank digest vials that were ﬁlled with Milli-Q water in the ﬁeld
and treated exactly as samples. Digest blank values were subtracted
from samples.

Samples were analyzed by high-resolution inductively coupled
mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS, FinniganMAT, Element 2) using
an Apex PFA desolvator/nebulizer (Elemental Scientiﬁc, Omaha,
NE). A freshwater plankton standard (BCR-414, Commission of
the European Communities) was analyzed to check analyte recov-
eries. The elements Al, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn had recoveries of
100± 5%, while recoveries of Cd (110%), Mo (132%), and Ni
(150%) were higher. Trichodesmium C and N quotas were deter-
mined using a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN analyzer. Element signals
were 23- to 41-fold above those in blank ashed GF/F ﬁlters; blank
values were subtracted from samples.

SXRF SAMPLE ANALYSIS
Samples for single-trichome SXRF analysis were prepared either
with or without an oxalate-EDTA treatment to remove adsorbed Fe
(Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2003). For the non-oxalate-treated samples,
glutaraldehyde-ﬁxed Trichodesmium colonies or single trichomes
were removed from the centrifuge tube and pipetted in 10-μL
drops onto LUX ﬁlm-coated Cu TEM grids (Ted Pella, Redding,
CA). In order to avoid the formation of salt crystals, seawa-
ter was delicately wicked from the grids using the corner of a
Kimwipe. A 10-μL droplet of Milli-Q was then pipetted onto the
grid and immediately removed from the grid using a Kimwipe.

The number of replicate samples analyzed is listed for each technique. For inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and CHN analysis the number of
replicate bulk colony assemblages analyzed is shown. For synchrotron x-ray ﬂuorescence (SXRF) the number of trichome sections analyzed is shown. GSECARS and
2ID-E indicate the beamlines used to conduct SXRF analyses at the Advanced Photon Source.

The samples were then allowed to air dry in a laminar ﬂow hood.
For the oxalate-treated samples, a second batch of glutaraldehyde-
ﬁxed colonies were ﬁltered onto 25-mm diameter 1-μm pore
polycarbonate ﬁlter membranes under low vacuum pressure (<
50 mm Hg) and soaked for 15 min in trace-metal clean oxalate-
EDTA reagent (Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2003). Soaked cells were

−1 ammonium for-
subsequently rinsed three times with 0.8 mol L
mate solution isotonic to seawater. Trichodesmium colonies were
then resuspended in fresh ammonium formate solution and indi-
vidual colonies or trichomes were pipetted onto LUXﬁlm grids
and allowed to air dry. Dried grids were stored in the dark until
SXRF analysis.

The biogeochemical signature of Trichodesmium

Element concentrations and distributions within sections of
trichomes were analyzed at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne
National Laboratory, Argonne, Il, USA) using hard x-ray micro-
probe beamlimes 2ID-E and GSECARS 13ID-C. The 2ID-E beam-
line allows for high-resolution imaging (ca. 0.4 μm FWHM) via
a 10 keV x-ray beam focused with a Fresnel zone plate with a 320
micron diameter and 100 nm outermost zonewidth (X-radia, Inc,
Plesanton, CA). The 13ID-C beamline uses Kirkpatrick-Baez mir-
rors to focus a larger beam (ca. 2 μm FWHM) useful for efﬁcient
scanning of larger areas. The lower resolution at GSECARS 13ID-
C enables scanning of larger sections of trichomes at the expense
of higher spatial resolution. Samples were analyzed at both beam-
lines inside a He-ﬁlled sample chamber to reduce background Ar
ﬂuorescence and maximize efﬁciency of detection of x-ray ﬂuo-
rescence originating from low-Z elements. At GSECARS samples
were analyzed using a monochromatic 7.3 keV x-ray beam in order
to improve sensitivity for elements of lower energy such as P and S.
Element quantiﬁcation of spatial regions of interest (ROI; e.g.,
trichome section, background) within each trichome section was
performed as described by Twining et al. (2011). Brieﬂy, spectra of
pixels belong to each ROI were averaged and ﬁt using the software
package MAPS (Vogt, 2003). A multi-element exponentially mod-
iﬁed Gaussian peak model was used to convert peak areas to areal
element concentrations using NBS-certiﬁed thin-ﬁlm standards
(SRM 1832 and SRM 1833). The conversion factor for the ele-
ments P and S which are not present in either SRM was obtained
interpolating the conversion factor of other elements as a func-
tion of their theoretical ﬂuorescence yield (Núñez-Milland et al.,
2010). The areal element concentration of each trichome ROI was
calculated after subtraction of a background ROI recorded in close
proximity to the trichome ROI.

STATISTICAL TREATMENT
Phosphorous-normalized element stoichiometries for samples
taken at different time points and measured using ICP-MS were
compared using a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test (JMP 9,

SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). As a subsample of SXRF sam-
ples was treated with an oxalate solution, a two-way ANOVA was
used to test the signiﬁcance of sampling time and oxalate treat-
ment effects. As the oxalate and non-oxalate samples showed no
signiﬁcant difference (p > 0.05) for metal and S quotas, these
data were subsequently grouped together, and temporal vari-
ability of S-normalized metal stoichiometries was tested using a
non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test.

RESULTS
ELEMENTAL CONTENT OF TRICHODESMIUM COLONIES
The bulk elemental content of Trichodesmium colonies was
assessed by analyses of picked colonies (Table 2). The measure-
ment of C and N on concurrent samples for each station allowed
normalizing ICP-MS element signatures to these additional bio-
mass proxies. Mean (± SD) C:N (6.03± 1.05 mol mol
−1) was
−1). How-
slightly below the canonical Redﬁeld ratio (6.7 mol mol
−1 at each station,
ever mean N:P ranged from 93 to 148 mol mol
and mean C:P was four- to seven-fold above the Redﬁeld ratio
−1 (Table 2), suggesting that cells were severely P-
of 106 mol mol
limited under the oligotrophic late-summer conditions present in
the surface waters of the Sargasso Sea. Vanadium was the most
−1 C), followed
abundant metal in the colonies (66–100 μmol mol
−1 C), Zn (6–29 μmol mol
−1 C), Ni and
by Fe (21–40 μmol mol
−1 C;
Mo (9–17 μmol mol
Table 2). Cadmium was approximately two orders of magnitude
less abundant in Trichodesmium (0.01–0.12 μmol mol

−1 C), and Mn and Cu (4–9 μmol mol
−1 C).

P- AND S-NORMALIZED METAL STOICHIOMETRIES
While C provides the most direct proxy for cell biomass, C
was not measured on the exact same samples as trace metals
due to the different analytical techniques required. Phospho-
rus, however, was measured on the same sample digests as the
metals, so P-normalized metal stoichiometries are used to more
precisely normalize metal contents to variations in colony bio-
mass between the picked samples. Mean P content per colony

The biogeochemical signature of Trichodesmium

varied 1.8-fold between stations (Table 2), but the P-normalized
metal stoichiometries measured by ICP-MS follow the trends
observed in the C-normalized stoichiometries (V:P > Fe:P > Zn:P
≈ Ni:P≈ Mo:P > Mn:P(cid:4) Cd:P; Table 3).

Stoichiometries of several metals (Fe, Mn, V) were measured
with both ICP-MS and SXRF in Trichodesmium collected from
the same station, enabling direct comparisons between the tech-
niques (Figure 2). Fe:P stoichiometries were generally comparable
−1), while Mn:P showed a systematic offset, with
(10–25 mmol mol
approximately threefold higher Mn:P measured in picked colonies
−1) than measured in sections
with ICP-MS (4.4–5.3 mmol mol
−1). V:P stoichiome-
of trichomes with SXRF (1.1–1.7 mmol mol
tries were fairly constant in communities of picked Trichodesmium
−1) but were highly variable in subsections of
(41–63 mmol mol
the trichomes analyzed with SXRF, ranging more than 500-fold
in trichomes collected from the same station. This complicates

comparison between techniques. However, SXRF V:P stoichiome-
tries were consistently higher than ICP-MS V:P stoichiometries at
one station, consistently lower at another station, and spanned the
ICP-MS stoichiometries at a third station, indicating that there
was not a systematic offset in results between the techniques and
that SXRF stoichiometries are a strong function of which trichome
section is analyzed.

Sections of two Trichodesmium colonies were further analyzed
at two different beamlines to examine variability on different spa-
tial scales. The compatibility of the data from the two beamlines
was assessed by comparing areal concentrations measured on the
same trichome section. The overlapping regions of analysis are
indicated for trichomes C and D in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.
The areal concentrations for V, Mn, and Fe measured at GSECARS
were consistently two- to ﬁve-fold below those measured in over-
lapping trichome sections at 2ID-E (Figure 5; Table 4). However

p = 0.042), as variations in bulk V:P, Fe:P, Mn:P, Ni:P, Mo:P, Al:P,
and Zn:P were not signiﬁcant (Figure 7). Temporal variations in
SXRF-analyzed trichomes were assessed with S-normalized stoi-
chiometries due to the lack of an effect of oxalate on S; this allowed
us to use all SXRF data in the comparison, increasing statistical
power. Only Fe:S varied signiﬁcantly with time (Kruskal–Wallis
test, p = 0.010), with the highest Fe concentrations measured
at noon (Figure 8). Bulk ICP-MS analyses could not be per-
formed for the noon sampling station due to a lack of sufﬁcient
Trichodesmium biomass (Table 1), and this difference in the com-
position of the datasets likely explains the contrasting statistical
results for the ICP-MS and SXRF data (as the highest Fe:P was
observed at noon).

SPATIAL ELEMENT DISTRIBUTION WITHIN TRICHODESMIUM
TRICHOMES
The spatial distribution of elements within Trichodesmium was
studied using SXRF mapping at two different beamlines with dif-
ferent spatial resolution. The step size was 1.5 and 0.4 μm for GSE-
CARS and 2ID-E, respectively. Element maps for P, S, V, Fe, and Ni
were compared to each other and to light micrographs of the same
trichome (Figures 3–4, 9–11). The outline of the Trichodesmium
trichomes is evident in both the light micrographs and the element
maps. Phosphorus and S were generally more evenly distributed
along trichomes than V and Fe (e.g., Figures 3–4, 9–11). Where
regions of Fe and V enrichment were observed, they typically did
not overlap with each other. For example, in trichome section
D-1 two zones of Fe enrichment are separated by a region of

less uniformly distributed and zones of enrichment were observed
in ca. 50% of trichomes (e.g., Figure 3, Map C-1, C-2). The high
spatial variability of V and Fe seen in trichome D is shown quanti-
tatively in a 1-D line plot presenting per-pixel concentrations along
the main axis of trichome section D-1 (Figure 12). The high vari-
ability within a trichome is further illustrated by a comparison of
the areal concentrations of P- and S-normalized metal stoichiome-
tries calculated for different regions of interest within trichomes C
and D using data from either GSECARS or 2ID-E (Table 4). Both
V and Fe varied two- to three-fold between sections of the same
trichome.

The higher incident x-ray energy used at 2ID-E also allowed us
to map the Ni distribution within trichome sections. In contrast
to V or Fe, Ni did not show notable enrichment in contiguous cells
of a trichome. However the sub-cellular Ni distribution within a
trichome differed from the distribution of other elements such as
P, S, V, Mn, and Fe. While the concentrations of the latter elements
were highest within each cell, Ni was most abundant in the mem-
branes connecting the cells (Figure 4, Maps D-III and D-V). Such
Ni distribution was not observed in trichome C (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
It is widely acknowledged that diazotrophs such as Trichodesmium
have high Fe quotas as a result of the biochemical demands of
the nitrogenase enzyme (Raven, 1988; Berman-Frank et al., 2001;
Kustka et al., 2003a), however elevated quotas of other metals
in Trichodesmium that may result from their unique physiology
have received less attention. This study documents elevated V,

rate beamlines (Figure 4). Other sections of the same trichome
have very homogenous elemental distributions. While Fe enrich-
ments zones were found in approximately 10% of trichomes,V was

Ni, and Mo in Trichodesmium collected from the Sargasso Sea,
utilizing both bulk and single-cell elemental analyses, and attempts
to understand the causes of this unique elemental signature.

Studies of metal quotas in plankton typically present metal con-
tents normalized to cell biomass. The major elemental constituents
C and P are often used as somewhat interchangeable proxies of
biomass (e.g., Bruland et al., 1991), however the Trichodesmium
samples analyzed in this study were signiﬁcantly depleted in P
relative to C and N, and thus comparisons between these results
and other studies will depend on the choice of biomass proxy.
Previous studies have documented similar enrichments in cellular
C and N, relative to P, in Trichodesmium from the Sargasso Sea
and grown in culture under P-limited conditions (White et al.,
2006; Orchard et al., 2010b), and Sañudo-Wilhelmy et al. (2001)
argue that Trichodesmium in the North Atlantic can be limited by
P availability. Phosphorus limitation of Trichodesmium is further
indicated by the Trichodesmium N:P ratios, which were elevated
above 50; this has been suggested as an indicator of P limita-
tion (Geider and La Roche, 2002). In contrast, Trichodesmium
collected from more P-replete waters near Western Australia pre-
sented a mean C:N:P ratio of 154:25:1 (Berman-Frank et al.,
2001).

Comparisons to cellular S measured with SXRF also indicate
that the Trichodesmium were depleted in P. Sulfur is incorporated

into cells primarily via cysteine and methionine and has been used
as an additional biomass proxy in previous SXRF studies (Twining
et al., 2004, 2011; King et al., 2011). Phosphorus:sulfur ratios in
P-replete cells experiencing elementally balanced growth are typ-
ically close to 1 (Payne and Price, 1999; Ho et al., 2003; Twining
et al., 2011), but P:S reported here for Trichodesmium are approx-
imately three- to six-fold below this (Table 5). Trichodesmium is
able to substitute non-P sulfolipids for phospholipids under P lim-
itation (Van Mooy et al., 2009), and this may also contribute to the
reduced P:S stoichiometries.

Irregardless of the choice of biomass proxy, comparisons to
published data clearly indicate that the Trichodesmium in this study
have elevated V, Mo, and Ni contents. In most non-diazotrophic
taxa Fe is generally the most abundant metal, followed by Zn, Mn,
Ni, Cd, and Mo (Bruland et al., 1991; Sunda and Huntsman, 1995,
2000; Ho et al., 2003; Twining et al., 2011). In contrast, V was
found to be the most abundant metal in Trichodesmium, with the
mean V quota exceeding the mean Fe quota by threefold. While
less abundant than Fe (and V), C-normalized Mo, and Ni quotas
were approximately 50- and 3-fold higher in Trichodesmium than
in previously studied non-diazotrophs (Ho et al., 2003; Twining
et al., 2011). Indeed, Mo and Ni were present at levels similar
to that of Zn, which is usually at least three times more abun-
dant than these metals in phytoplankton (Bruland et al., 1991;

also higher than has been observed in other groups of phyto-
plankton (Bruland et al., 1991; Ho et al., 2003; Twining et al.,

on ﬁeld populations of Trichodesmium collected from the western

sub-tropical North Atlantic (Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2006; Tovar-
Sanchez and Sañudo-Wilhelmy, 2011), which also showed high
cellular V, Mo, and Ni quotas. However,V stoichoimetries reported
here are at least 10-fold higher than measured in Trichodesmium
from the other regions (Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2006; Tovar-Sanchez
and Sañudo-Wilhelmy, 2011).

aerosols of anthropogenic origin due to fossil fuel combustion
in North America, adsorbed dust particles are a possible cause
of apparent increased quotas. Such combustion-derived aerosols
are enriched in V and Ni in comparison to soil-derived dust
particles (Sholkovitz et al., 2009). However only a few of the non-
oxalate rinsed trichome sections analyzed by SXRF had localized
V hotspots which do not correspond to the structure of contigu-
ous cells within a trichome (Figure 3 C-I to C-IV). Similar Fe
hotspots were also detected in a few trichomes (Figure 3 Map
C-1 and C-3), but these hotspots do not drive the higher V and
Fe quotas of the trichomes. Removing the pixels containing these
potential external particles reduces the V and Fe quotas by less
than 5%. Further, because V, Fe, and Ni do not co-localize in these
hotspots, an anthropogenic origin for these particles is unlikely.
Rather, it is likely that the particles are lithogenic. Recent work
by Rubin et al. (2011) indicates that Trichodesmium may process

particulate Fe associated with colonies to obtain Fe. However, given
that Fe:P ratios were comparable in analyzed colonies and individ-
ual trichomes, and that the Fe hotspots observed on the trichomes
did not contribute signiﬁcantly to their Fe content, it does not
appear that external particles associated with colonies were a sig-
niﬁcant contributor to Trichodesmium elemental composition in
this study. Although signiﬁcant populations of metazoa, protozoa,
algae, and bacteria may be associated with Trichodesmium colonies
(Sheridan et al., 2002; Hewson et al., 2009), efforts were made to
avoid these through manual isolation of individual colonies. The
comparable Fe results for colonies and individual trichomes again
suggest that such organisms, if present, also did not contribute
signiﬁcantly to the elemental content of the Trichodesmium.

Results from the oxalate rinse also indicate that the elevated
metal quotas are not due to extracellular material. A comparison of
−2) for oxalate and non-oxalate-
the areal concentrations (nmol cm
treated cells from each station reveals that neither Fe and V, nor
Mn and S, varied signiﬁcantly between rinse treatments. To what
extend this oxalate rinse can remove other elements such as V, Mn,
or S has not been studied in detail. Although the oxalate treatment
was developed to remove externally adsorbed Fe (Tovar-Sanchez
et al., 2003), we observed P removal of up to 47% from oxalate-
treated trichome sections; this matches previous reports of oxalate
usage with Trichodesmium (Sañudo-Wilhelmy et al., 2004). The
SXRF samples were ﬁxed with glutaraldehyde prior to rinsing, and
this could have impacted the lability of internal P as well (Tang
and Morel, 2006), but other studies with unﬁxed Trichodesmium
have reported even higher P removal with oxalate (Tovar-Sanchez
and Sañudo-Wilhelmy, 2011). Overall the oxalate treatment did
not affect the areal metal concentrations of Trichodesmium signif-
icantly, and we conclude that the inﬂuence of adsorbed lithogenic
material on the quotas is insigniﬁcant.

While increased cell quotas do not necessarily indicate
increased biological requirements, the elevated quotas of V, Fe,
and Mo may result from Trichodesmium’s biochemical machinery,
including metalloenzymes related to the demands of N ﬁxation.
Nitrogen ﬁxation is enabled by the expression of the metalloen-
zyme nitrogenase. There are three known metallotypes of nitro-
genase, containing either Mo and Fe (MoFe), V and Fe (FeV),
or Fe only (FeFe; Bothe et al., 2010). Each type of nitrogenase
requires a speciﬁc nitrogenase reductase (i.e., nifH, vnfH, and
anfH, respectively) which is properly redox-tuned to the corre-
sponding nitrogenase, as well as a suite of other proteins for proper
enzyme assembly. While it is tempting to explain the V contents
of Trichodesmium through expression of FeV nitrogenase, the Tri-
chodesmium erythraeum genome lacks the δ subunit encoded by
vnfG which is thought to be required for V-dependent N ﬁxation
(Eady, 2003; and references therein). Furthermore, in Azotobacter
vinelandii, a model bacterium containing all three metallotypes of
nitrogenase, nifDK (encoding for the MoFe protein) is universally
expressed in the presence of MoFe whereas vnfDGK (encoding for
FeV protein) is expressed only under low Mo conditions or under
cooler temperatures. Neither condition applies to the Sargasso Sea,
suggesting little if any selective pressure toward a V-dependent N
ﬁxation pathway in Trichodesmium. Given the high and nearly
conservative concentrations of Mo in seawater (ca. 100 nM), the
high intracellular Mo quotas measured here, and the lack of spatial
or temporal correlations of V and Fe in cells, it appears that the

nitrogenase enzyme is likely responsible for the elevated Fe and Mo
contents – but not the elevated V contents – of Trichodesmium.

The high V content of Trichodesmium may instead result from
the presence of otherV-dependent metalloenzymes.Vanadium can
also serve as a cofactor in haloperoxidases, and vanadium haloper-
oxidases (VHPO) have been structurally characterized for marine
red (Corallina ofﬁcialis) and brown (Ascophyllum nodosum) algae,
as well as in the fungi Curvularia inaequalis (reviews in Crans et al.,
2004; Winter and Moore, 2009). If expressed, such VHPOs may act
as an antioxidant and help neutralize reactive oxygen species such
as hydrogen peroxide (Drábková et al., 2006, 2007). Hydrogen
peroxide is a by-product of photosynthesis (Bienert et al., 2006)
and is especially damaging to the nitrogenase enzyme (Fay, 1992).
An antioxidant role of VHPOs in Trichodesmium would be espe-
cially beneﬁcial because Trichodesmium ﬁxes N during daylight,
and neutralizing reactive oxygen species by VHPOs might help
facilitate simultaneously ﬁxation of C and N. Johnson et al. (2011)
recently described a 68 kDa VHPO encoded in the genome of the
coastal cyanobacterium Synechococcus CC9311 and demonstrated
the protein’s capacity for bromoperoxidase activity. As homologs
were only present in one other sequenced Synechococcus genome,
they suggested this may be the result of a recent horizontal gene
transfer event into Synechococcus. The T. erythraeum genome con-
tains a putative acid phosphatase/vanadium-dependent haloper-
oxidase related protein (Accession number ABG53180). However
the putative Trichodesmium protein, predicted to be 151 amino
acids long (16.6 kDa), is much smaller than the well-characterized
609 amino acid (67.5 kDa) VHPO from Curvularia inaequalis
(Accession CAA59686.1; Simons et al., 1995), and the T. ery-
thraeum protein does not align with the region of the C. inaequalis
protein that contains the amino acids required for activity (Hem-
rika et al., 1999). At this point, genomic evidence for either a V-
dependent nitrogenase or a V-dependent HPO (with amino acids
known to coordinate V in other VHPOs) is lacking. However, there
are numerous metalloproteins in prokaryotes, including those that
incorporate V, that have yet to be identiﬁed (Cvetkovic et al., 2010).
Vanadium could also be accumulated unintentionally by Tri-
chodesmium via phosphate uptake mechansisms. If not complexed
by siderophore-like compounds (Bellenger et al., 2007, 2011), V is
expected to be present primarily as HVO2−
4 at pH 8 under oxic con-
ditions (Crans et al., 2004). Vanadate and phosphate are similar in
structure and electronic properties, but phosphate is more inert
and not involved in redox transformations (Crans et al., 2004).
Given that Trichodesmium populations are sometimes P-limited
in the North Atlantic (Sañudo-Wilhelmy et al., 2001; Mills et al.,
2004) it is intriguing to speculate that vanadate acquisition may
occur under vanishingly low phosphate concentrations. Arsenate
is taken up by phytoplankton via phosphate transporters (Orem-
land and Stolz, 2003), and As reduction (which follows uptake) is
correlated with chlorophyll concentrations in the western North
Atlantic (Cutter et al., 2001). While a P dependence of arsenate
uptake has not been conﬁrmed at the ultra-low phosphate con-
centrations characteristic of the Sargasso Sea (Foster et al., 2008),
it is quite plausible that V may be taken up through this mech-
anism. It is interesting to note that the spatial distributions of
V and P in the trichomes are not identical (Figures 3–4, 9–11).
The difference in cellular allocation may reﬂect redox reactions or
other intracellular sequestration of V following uptake.

The biogeochemical signature of Trichodesmium

In order to allow for N ﬁxation in the non-heterocystous
cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spatial and temporal separation
strategies are thought to separate the oxygen sensitive nitroge-
nase enzyme from the photosynthesis machinery (Berman-Frank,
2001; Berman-Frank et al., 2007; Finzi-Hart et al., 2009). Some
trichomes collected at noon in this study showed the presence of
contiguous cells enriched in Fe. In some samples these regions of
elevated Fe were not evenly distributed over the whole trichome
but were localized to zones separated by regions enriched in V
(Figures 4, 11–12). Such zones of Fe enrichment appear similar
to the diazocytes identiﬁed in Trichodesmium (El-Shehawy, 2003;
Sandh et al., 2011) and may represent zones of N ﬁxation. In
addition, such Fe enrichment zones in Trichodesmium were only
observed for trichomes collected at noon. Interestingly, the mean
Fe:P ratio for Trichodesmium samples collected at noon was signif-
icant higher than at any other sampling time. This is in agreement
with the hypothesis that the onset of N ﬁxation follows C ﬁxation
at midday (Finzi-Hart et al., 2009) and the highest expression of
nifH (El-Shehawy, 2003).

The enrichment of Ni in Trichodesmium biomass likely also
follows from biochemical usage. Nickel shows a distinctive spatial
distribution with the highest concentration in the transverse wall
membrane of Trichodesmium trichomes. Such distribution is in
agreement with Ni containing membrane-bound enzymes such as
urease (Collier et al., 1999), NiFe uptake hydrogenase (Tamagnini
et al., 2002), and Ni-superoxide dismutase (Ni-SOD; Dupont et al.,
2008b). SOD provides an important defense tool against the tox-
icity of superoxide by converting superoxide to molecular oxygen
and hydrogen peroxide (McCord and Fridovich, 1969; Fridovich,
1989). Hydrogen peroxide is then further converted to water by
peroxidases such as the previously described VHPOs (Crans et al.,
2004). All aerobic organisms contain at least one isoform of SOD
(containing either Fe, Mn, Cu/Zn, or Ni) with Trichodesmium con-
taining the gene coding for Ni-SOD and Mn-SOD (Dupont et al.,
2008a). Such mechanism is beneﬁcial for Trichodesmium as the
4Fe-4S cluster in the nitrogenase complex is highly susceptible
to the inactivation of superoxide. As H2 is a side product of N
ﬁxation, all diazotrophic organisms contain NiFe hydrogenases
(Tamagnini et al., 2002). In general these are divided into four
groups, of which cyanobacteria have an uptake hydrogenase clus-
tering together with cytoplasmic H2 sensors and a bidirectional
hydrogenase. While the bidirectional hydrogenase enzyme prob-
ably plays a role in fermentation or in electron transfer processes
during photosynthesis, the uptake NiFe hydrogenase rapidly cat-
alyzes H2 produced during N ﬁxation (Tamagnini et al., 2007).
Only genes belonging to the uptake hydrogenase have been con-
ﬁrmed in Trichodesmium (Tamagnini et al., 2007). In addition
to SOD and NiFe hydrogenases, the genome of Trichodesmium
revealed the presence of a urease subunit alpha, subunit beta, and
subunit gamma (Dupont et al., 2008a). Trichodesmium is able to
grow on urea and as well on nitrate and ammonia (LaRoche and
Breitbarth, 2005; Post et al., 2012), however urea is unlikely to be
a signiﬁcant source of N to Trichodesmium in the Sargasso Sea
in the late summer (Orcutt et al., 2001). Thus it is unlikely that
urease is driving the elevated Ni quotas of Trichodesmium. Rather,
Ni is likely primarily incorporated into membrane enzymes such
as Ni-SOD and NiFe hydrogenase.

Zinc contents of Trichodesmium may also be explained by
usage in metalloenzymes. It has been suggested that cyanobac-
teria evolved under sulﬁdic conditions of low Zn availability
that has resulted in lower Zn contents of modern cyanobacteria
(Saito et al., 2003). In contrast, the elevated Zn quotas of Tri-
chodesmium reported here may reﬂect the P-limiting condition of
the Sargasso Sea and the subsequent expression of the Zn met-
alloenzyme alkaline phosphatase in Trichodesmium, as would be
expected in cells growing on organic P substrates (Orchard et al.,
2010a,b). Similarly, Synechoccocus in the Sargasso Sea increases
its Zn quota substantially in anticyclonic eddies characterized by
reduced phosphate delivery (Twining et al., 2010).

The Redﬁeld ratio, and the proposed extension of this concept
to include bioactive metals, is based on consistency of the average
elemental composition of plankton. Indeed there is remarkable
agreement in the bulk C:N:P ratios of plankton when data are
aggregated (Geider and La Roche, 2002, and references therein),
and compilations of selected bulk particulate metal studies have
produced relative agreement (Bruland et al., 1991; Ho, 2006).
However it has also been demonstrated that there is real and
important spatial and taxonomic variability in the macronutri-
ent and trace metal stoichiometries of plankton which underlie
the average ratios (e.g., Geider and La Roche, 2002; Twining et al.,
2004, 2011). Hence, a uniﬁed element stoichiometry should always
be treated as a“statistical composition”(Redﬁeld, 1958; Geider and
La Roche, 2002). There is much to be learned about cell physiol-
ogy, ecology and biogeochemistry from comparisons of plankton
representing individual taxa and regions to the average elemental
composition. The natural Trichodesmium populations described
in this paper provide an example of how the physiology of an indi-
vidual group, as well as the environmental conditions, can cause
signiﬁcant deviations from the averaged, idealized stoichiometric
composition. The extent to which the unique elemental compo-
sition of Trichodesmium will impact nutrient and metal cycling
in the surrounding waters will depend on the fate of the accu-
mulated cell biomass. Future studies which combine elemental
analyses of plankton with “-omics” approaches that constrain the
genetic and biochemical composition of the same communities
and populations will do much to advance our understanding of
biogeochemistry in the ocean.
