Using a cocktail of cytokines and small molecules, we dem- onstrate that primitive neural stem (NS) cells derived from mouse ES cells and rat embryos can be maintained.
Furthermore, using the same set of cytokines and small molecules, we show that induced NS (iNS) cells can be generated from rat ﬁbroblasts by forced expression of the transcrip- tional factors Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc.
The generation and long-term maintenance of iNS cells could have wide and momentous implications.
Neural stem (NS) cells can be expanded in culture while retain- ing the ability to differentiate into the three main cell types of the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes and oligoden-  * Corresponding author.

NS cells hold great promise for treating neurode- generative diseases and spinal cord injury.
If the full potential of NS cells in cell replacement therapies is to be realized, non- cerebrocerebellar sources of patient-speciﬁc NS cells must be found because the brain tissue is not readily accessible.
Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells [2] as well as neurons [3  6], cardiomyocytes [7 9], blood [10] and hepatocytes [11,12] have been generated from ﬁbroblasts through reprogramming by de- ﬁned transcription factors.
These breakthroughs in cellular reprogramming have provided a new avenue for generating pa- tient-speciﬁc NS cells from readily accessible tissues such as der- mal ﬁbroblasts.
Successful generation of induced NS cells will require the identiﬁcation of NS cell fate-inducing factors as well as application of carefully-contrived culture conditions that can capture the NS cell state and allow its long-term self-renewal.
Several recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of con- verting mouse ﬁbroblasts directly into neural progenitors/NS cells by forced expression of different sets of transcription  1672-0229/$ - see front matter ª 2013 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of China.

In the present study, we developed a culture condition that allows long-term expansion of Sox1-positive primitive NS cells.
Using this culture condition, we efﬁciently generated iNS cells from rat ﬁbroblasts by combined expression of the transcriptional factors Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc.
Results  Maintenance of Sox1-GFP positive NS cells by leukemia inhibitory factor, CHIR99021 and Y27632  Sox1 is one of the earliest speciﬁc markers of neuroectoderm [17].
By taking advantage of the Sox1-GFP knock-in reporter mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell line we developed [18], we gen- erated pure Sox1-GFP positive NS cells and tested different combinations of cytokines and small molecules for propagation of Sox1-positive NS cells.
We found that concurrent treatment with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), CHIR99021 and Y27632 (  LIF/CHIR/Y   hereafter) allowed long-term expan- sion of Sox1-GFP positive NS cells, even from single cells (Fig- ure 1A).
CHIR99021 and Y27632 are small molecules that speciﬁcally inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), respectively [19,20].
Similar NS cell lines from rat fetal brains and human ES cells were also derived and maintained in the presence of LIF/CHIR/Y (Fig- ure 1B E).
As expected, Sox1-positive NS cells failed to be main- tained in the presence of ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Figure 1F), the conventional culture condition for the propagation of neural progenitors [21,22].
iNS cells derived from rat ﬁbroblasts  Next, we investigated whether iNS cells could be generated from ﬁbroblasts in the presence of LIF/CHIR/Y.
Initially, we trans- duced mouse and rat embryonic ﬁbroblasts with retroviral vec- tors encoding the reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, and cultured the cells in the LIF/CHIR/Y condition.
Three weeks after transduction, approximately 50 and 20 colo- nies emerged from 1   105 plated mouse and rat ﬁbroblasts, respectively.
Colonies formed from mouse ﬁbroblasts showed the appearance of iPS cells (Figure S1).
Surprisingly, most of the colonies formed from rat ﬁbroblasts morphologically resem- bled the NS cells maintained in the presence of LIF/CHIR/Y (Figure 2A).
We picked 11 NS cell-like colonies and found that all of them were expanded in the presence of LIF/CHIR/Y to establish stable cell lines (Figure 2B and C).
These cells expressed NS cell markers (Figure 2D H) and differentiated exclusively into different subtypes of neurons, astrocytes and oligodendro- cytes upon the removal of LIF/CHIR/Y, even after 60 passages (Figure 3).
Moreover, neurons derived from these rat iNS cells exhibited typical functional membrane properties of neurons (Figure S2).
Similar iNS cells were also efﬁciently generated from rat tail-tip ﬁbroblasts using both retroviral and PiggyBac transposon systems (Figure S3).

Rat iNS cells generated and main- tained in the presence of LIF/CHIR/Y expressed Pax6 and Sox1 (Figure 2E and F), indicating an early stage NS cell  identity.
To further conﬁrm the developmental stage of these rat iNS cells, we examined their gene expression pattern by RT-PCR.

and FAM70A, genes that are uniquely expressed in early stage NS cells, whereas the expression of S100B, PMP2 and AQP4, speciﬁc markers for FGF2/EGF NS cells [23], was not de- tected.
In contrast with rat iNS cells maintained in the presence of LIF/CHIR/Y, NS cells maintained in the presence of FGF2/EGF expressed S100B, PMP2 and AQP4, but not DACH1, PLZF, LIX1 and FAM70A (Figure 4A).
Next, we analyzed the expression of regional identity mark- ers along the anterior posterior and dorsal ventral axes of the brain.
The expression of telencephalic markers FoxG1, Emx1 and Nkx2.1 was not detected by RT-PCR in rat iNS cells  in- stead, rat iNS cells highly expressed anterior hindbrain mark- ers Gbx2, Nkx6.1 and Krox20.
The posterior hindbrain markers HoxB1 and HoxB4, however, were not expressed in rat iNS cells (Figure 4C).
Along the dorsal ventral axis, rat iNS cells expressed ventral hindbrain markers Irx3 and Pax6, but not the extreme ventral markers Olig2 and Nkx2.2 or the dorsal markers Pax7 and Pax3 (Figure 4D).
Taken to- gether, these results suggest that rat iNS cells generated and maintained in the presence of LIF/CHIR/Y represent early stage primitive NS cells and have an anterior-ventral hindbrain character.
Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc are sufﬁcient to reprogram rat ﬁbroblasts into a NS cell fate  Loss of function in the tumor-suppressive p53 pathway has been shown to dramatically accelerate the reprogramming pro- cess [24 26].
Indeed, when ﬁbroblasts derived from p53 /  rat embryos were subjected to reprogramming [27], iNS cell-like colonies emerged as early as 4 days after transduction (data not shown).
To determine which of the four factors are re- quired to generate iNS cells, we transduced rat ﬁbroblasts with different combinations of the four factors.
The results, as sum- marized in Figure S4, showed that Oct4/Sox2/c-Myc and Sox2/c-Myc were sufﬁcient to generate iNS cells from wild- type and p53 /  rat ﬁbroblasts, respectively.
No iNS cell-like colonies emerged in any of the combinations without either Sox2 or c-Myc, suggesting that both Sox2 and c-Myc were re- quired for the conversion of rat ﬁbroblasts into iNS cells.
Fi- nally, we investigated whether the induction of iNS cells entails a passage through the iPS cell stage.
We derived ﬁbro- blasts from Oct4-GFP transgenic rat embryos in which the GFP transgene was driven by the Oct4 promoter.
GFP-posi- tive cells were never observed during the reprogramming of   316  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 312 319  Figure 4 Regional identity of rat iNS cells A.

ﬁbroblasts to iNS cells (Figure S5), suggesting that iNS cells were most likely converted directly from ﬁbroblasts without passing through an intermediate iPS state.
Discussion  Here we show that self-renewal of Sox1-positive primitive NS cells derived from mouse, rat and human can be efﬁciently maintained in serum-free N2B27 medium supplemented with LIF/CHIR/Y.
Moreover, by forced expression of Oct4/Sox2/ c-Myc, rat ﬁbroblasts can be directly converted into self- renewing iNS cells under the LIF/CHIR/Y condition.
These rat iNS cells have all the key characteristics of primary NS cells including expression of the NS cell markers and the potential to differentiate into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and mature neurons with functional membrane properties.
Intriguingly, combined expression of the same factors failed to convert mouse ﬁbroblasts to iNS cells.
We reason that additional fac- tor(s) or different combinations of factors are required for the generation of mouse iNS cells.
Rat iNS cells require LIF for self-renewal and predomi- nately differentiate into neurons upon the removal of self-re- newal factors, suggesting that they may be equivalent to in vivo primitive NS cells [28].
Interestingly, rat iNS cells main- tained in the presence of LIF/CHIR/Y have an anterior-ven- tral hindbrain character, distinguishing them from mouse iNS cells maintained in the presence of FGF2/EGF [16] or ro- sette human NS cells [23].
Further studies will be needed to determine whether these rat iNS cells are capable of differenti- ation toward different region-speciﬁc neuronal fates in re- sponse to patterning cues.
Rat iNS cells could not be generated from rat ﬁbroblasts in the absence of LIF and CHIR99021, further supporting the notion that culture environments could dictate the fate of reprogrammed cells [29].
We hypothesize that iNS cells can also be generated from human ﬁbroblasts using an approach similar to that described here.
Generation of patient-speciﬁc iNS cells will not only enable us to develop new tools for the diagnosis of neurological diseases, but also provide a pure and renewable source of patient-speciﬁc neural cells for use in cell replacement therapies and drug discovery.
Xi G et al / Rat Induced Neural Stem Cells  317  Materials and methods  Primitive NS cells culture  Prospective head regions from E9.5 to E11.5 rat embryos at neural-fold stage were excised and treated with dissociation buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.25% trypsin in phos- phate-buffered saline (PBS) for 4 min.
Neuroepithelium was detached from the underlying tissue and mechanically dis- sected into single cells.
The cells were cultured in poly-L- lysine/laminin-coated dishes with N2B27 medium [30] contain- ing LIF (1000 units/ml), CHIR99021 (3 lM) and Y27632 (10 lM).
CHIR99021 and Y27632 were synthesized in the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, University of Dun- dee, UK.
ES cell culture and differentiation  Rat ES cells were routinely maintained in the 2i condition as described [31 33].
46C mouse ES cells were routinely cultured and converted to Sox1-GFP positive NS cells as described [18].
Transient selection with puromycin (0.5 lg/ml) and ﬂuores- cence activated cell sorting (FACS) were used to eliminate non-neural cells and obtain homogeneous population of Sox1-GFP positive NS cells.
Sox1-GFP NS cells were then re-plated onto 0.1% gelatin- or poly-L-lysine/laminin-coated plates and cultured in N2B27 medium supplemented with LIF (1000 units/ml), CHIR99021 and Y27632 (10 lM).
For the derivation of clonal lines, individual Sox1- GFP NS cells were deposited into 96-well plates and cultured in the presence of LIF/CHIR/Y.
The presence of one cell per well was conﬁrmed under microscopy 1 h after plating.
Estab- lished Sox1-GFP NS cell lines were trypsinized and expanded every 3 4 days at a subculture ratio of 1:2 3.
(3 lM)  cells were harvested by  5   104 cells/cm2 and cultured in N2B27 medium supplemented with FGF2 (20 ng/ml), EGF (20 ng/ml) and SHH (200 ng/ml) (all from PeproTech) for 10 days.
At day 11, cells were disso- ciated with trypsin and replated onto poly-L-lysine/laminin- coated dishes in the presence of PDGF-AA (10 ng/ml) and T3 (triiodothyronine, Sigma, 40 ng/ml) to promote differentia- tion toward oligodendrocyte lineage [34].
For neuronal differ- entiation, trypsinization and transferred to petri dishes in N2B27 medium.
After 4 days, aggregated cells were replated onto poly-L-lysine/laminin- coated 4-well plates at a density of 3 4   104 cells/cm2 in N2B27 medium and cultured for another 8 10 days.
For induction of midbrain precursors, iNS cells were cultured in N2B27 medium supplemented with 200 ng/ml SHH, 100 ng/ml FGF8 (PeproTech) and 160 lM ascorbic acid (Sigma Aldrich) for 8 days.
The cells were subsequently differentiated in N2B27 medium with SHH (200 ng/ml), FGF8 (100 ng/ml) and BDNF (20 ng/ml) for 10 days.
Motor neurons were generated by exposing iNS cells to SHH (500 ng/ml) and RA (0.05 lM) for 7 days, followed by culturing in the presence of 20 ng/ml BDNF and 200 ng/ml SHH in N2B27 medium.
Retrovirus packaging  The day before transfection, GP2 293 cells were seeded onto 10 cm dishes.
On the next day, pMXs-based retroviral vectors (pMXs-mOct4, pMXs-mSox2, pMXs-mKlf4 and pMXs-mc- Myc, Addgene) and pCMV-VSVG (Addgene) were co-trans- fected into GP2 293 cells using Lipofectamine LTX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufac- turer s protocols.
24 h after transfection, the medium was re- placed and the virus-containing supernatants were collected 48 and 72 h after transfection.
After centrifugation to remove the cell debris, the viruses were ﬁltered through a 0.45-mm cellulose acetate ﬁlter and stored at  80  C.  Immunostaining  Generation of rat iNS cells  Immunostaining was performed according to a standard pro- tocol.
Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 546 were used as sec- ondary conjugates and nuclear counterstaining was performed with DAPI.
Primary antibodies used include the following: Nestin (1:400  Santa Cruz Biotechnology)  Pax6 (1:50  DSHB, Iowa)  Sox1 (1:100  BD Biosciences)  Sox2 (1:200  Santa Cruz Biotechnology)  Tuj1 (1:2000, Sigma)  GFAP (1:300  Santa tyrosine Cruz Biotechnology)  GABA (1:1000  Sigma)  hydroxylase (1:1000  Sigma)  Rip (1:50  DSHB, Iowa)  MAP2 (1:500  Millipore)  HB9 (1:50  DSHB, Iowa)  PLZF (1:100  Calbiochem, Iowa)  synapsin (1:500  Millipore)  NeuN (1:500  Millipore)  Nanog (1:200  Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and SSEA1 (1:200  Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Differentiation of NS cells  For astrocyte differentiation, iNS cells were cultured as free- ﬂoating neurospheres in N2B27 medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml of EGF and 20 ng/ml of FGF2 for 7 10 days.
Spheres were trypsinized into single cells and replated onto poly-L-lysine/laminin-coated 4-well plates at 5   104 cells/cm2 in N2B27 medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum.
For oligodendrocyte differentiation, iNS cells were seeded at  rat  (REF)  embryonic ﬁbroblast  Oct4-GFP transgenic rats were obtained from the Rat Re- source and Research Center.
Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were purchased from Harlan.
Animal experiments were performed according to the investigator s protocols ap- proved by the USC Institutional Animal Care and Use Com- mittee.
For isolation, embryos from E14.5 timed-pregnant rats were washed with PBS.
The head and intestinal organs were removed from iso- lated embryos.
The remaining tissue was manually dissociated and incubated in 0.25% trypsin for 10 15 min.
After trypsin- ization was halted with serum medium and centrifugation, the cells were plated into 10-cm tissue culture dishes with MEF medium (GMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin).
To establish postnatal tail-tip ﬁbroblasts (TTFs), the tails from one-week-old p53 / , p53 /+ and p53+/+ rat pups were peeled, minced into 1-cm pieces, placed in 35-mm culture dishes, and incubated in MEF medium until conﬂuent.
For iNS reprogramming, the REFs or TTFs were seeded at 1   105 cells per 35-mm dish, and the four-factor viral cocktail was added every other day in the presence of polybrene (4 lg/ll).
After the second virus infection, cells were trans- ferred onto c-irradiated CF1-MEF feeders and cultured in   318  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 312 319  neural reprogramming medium (mouse ES medium and N2B27 medium mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 3 lM CHIR99021 and 1000 units/ml LIF).
iNS cells were generated and maintained in N2B27 medium supplemented with LIF/CHIR/Y.
Electrophysiology analysis  Cells cultured on glass coverslips were transferred to a submer- sion recording chamber and visualized under IR-DIC optics (Olympus BX51 WI).
The recording chamber was perfused with artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 126 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgSO4, 26 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2 and 10 dextrose, saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2.
Whole-cell recording electrode solution contained (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 2 NaCl, 0.2 EGTA, 0.3 GTP-Tris, 4 ATP-Mg, 10 HEPES and 14 phosphocreatine-Tris (pH 7.25   290 mOsm).
Resting membrane potentials (RMPs) were measured upon establishing whole cell conﬁguration following gigaohm seal break-ins.
After current steps were injected to eli- cit action potentials, neurons were tested with a series of volt- age commands to record the action currents.
Neurons were then voltage clamped at RMP in the presence of TTX (1 lM) and bicuculline (20 lM) to record miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs).
The AMPA receptor antago- nist CNQX (20 lM) was washed in at the end of experiments to verify the mEPSCs were indeed glutamatergic.
Electrical sig- nals were ampliﬁed with a Multiclamp 700B ampliﬁer, digi- tized at 10 kHz with Digidata 1440A and acquired under control of pClamp 10.2 software (all from Molecular Devices).
RT-PCR and qRT-PCR  Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture s instruction.
cDNA was synthe- sized with 1 lg of total RNA using Cloned AMV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit.
PCR reaction mixtures were prepared with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen).
qRT-PCR was per- formed with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer s instructions.
Signals were detected with an ABI7900HT Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
The relative expression level was deter- mined by the 2-dCT method and normalized against GAPDH.
