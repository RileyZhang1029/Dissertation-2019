In the current investigation, the status of the septohippocampal cholinergic pathway and hippocampal mitogenactivated protein 
kinase (MAPK) signaling was examined in male Wistar rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, which showed cognitive 
deficits based on assessment on a version of the Morris water maze. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion was induced by bilateral 
common artery occlusion and maintained for 12 weeks until behavioral testing. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion was shown to 
induce memory impairments and microglial activation in regions of white matter, including the fimbria of hippocampus. Choline 
acetyltransferase expression of the basal forebrain and expression of hippocampal MAPKs was decreased in rats with BCCAo 
compared to control rats. The results of this study suggest that cognitive decline induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion could be 
related to dysfunction of the basal forebrain cholinergic system and reduction of hippocampal MAPK activities.

period and eventually leads to the development and progression 
of vascular dementia (VaD) (Farkas et al., 2007), which is the second 
most common type of dementia following Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
The neurobiological markers and signaling pathway underlying AD 
have been well established, whereas its role in VaD has not been well 
characterized. 
To understand the role of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in the 
development of cognitive dysfunction in VaD, it is important to 
explore the causal relationships between cerebral hypoperfusion 
and dependant events such as changes in neurobiological markers, 
signal pathway, and cognitive function. Furthermore, recognition

Septal-hippocampal System in Rats with Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion

of particular cellular mechanisms in the chain of events from 
chronic cerebral hypoperfusion to a cognitive decline may identify 
potential targets for effective therapies. To accomplish this, chronic 
cerebral hypoperfusion was induced in male Wistar rats with 
permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid artery (BCCAo), 
which reduces the cerebral blood flow persistently as occurs in 
human aging, AD and also in VaD (Otori et al., 2003). Therefore, 
studies using animals with BCCAo have been conducted to reveal 
the longterm consequences of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion 
that leads to VaD.
One of the consistently reported characteristics in studies using 
animals with BCCAo is microglial activation at white matter sites 
(Farkas et al., 2004). The injury of white matter visualized with 
clinical imaging techniques has been reported to coincide with 
cognitive disorders in patients with VaD (Barber et al., 1999). 
Specifically, microglial activation labeled by OX42 or OX6 is 
much more evident in the white matter, than in the gray matter 
of rat brains with BCCAo (Wakita et al., 1994). Subsequently, 
the microglial activation may exacerbate white matter lesions, 
since the activated microglias produce reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, chronic cerebral 
hypoperfusion invariably induces white matter lesions and 
scattered foci of cortical microinfarcts either with or without 
hippocampal damage (Wakita et al., 1994; Ni et al., 1995). Rats 
with BCCAo exhibit memory deficits. For example, rats with 
BCCAo failed to find a hidden platform in the Morris water 
maze task (Ohta et al., 1997) and committed more errors in the 
eightarm radial maze in comparison with control rats (Ni et al., 
1994). The working memory that was measured using an object 
recognition task was also impaired in rats with BCCAo (Sarti et al., 
2002). 
Degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) 
has been found to be associated with the cognitive decline that 
occurs in VaD and AD because the BFCN widely innervates 
the hippocampus and cortex (Bartus et al., 1982; Sharp et al., 
2009). It was also reported in an animal study using BCCAo that 
hippocampal cholinergic markers were altered in the hippocampus 
(Ni et al., 1995; Kumaran et al., 2008). The present experiment 
was conducted to examine the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) 
expression and microglial inflammation of BFCN and microglial 
inflammation of the fimbria of hippocampus in rats with spatial 
memory impairments induced by BCCAo. In addition, mitogen
activated protein kinase (MAPK: ERK, JNK, p38) and MAPK 
phosphorylation of the hippocampus was examined in rats 
with BCCAo based on previous findings that dysfunction of the 
cholinergic septohippocampal system is associated with altered 
MAPK signaling (Williams et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2007; 

Giovannini et al., 2008). 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects
Thirtyfive male Wistar rats were used in these experiments 
(12 weeks; Charles River Co., Gapeung, South Korea). The 
rats resided in a vivarium at Konkuk University for 2 weeks at 
the beginning of the experiment at a controlled temperature 
(22±1oC) and humidity (50±10%) on a 12 hour alternate light/
dark cycle (lights on at 0800 h). Food and water were provided ad 
libitum throughout the experiment. All animal procedures were 
conducted in accordance with the approved institutional animal 
care procedures and guidelines of the institutional animal care and 
use committee of Konkuk University.

Surgical procedure
Animals were anesthetized using 5% isoflurane and oxygen 
mixture and maintained with 3% isoflurane during the surgical 
procedure. A midline incision was made to expose the bilateral 
common carotid arteries, which were tightly double ligated with 
silk sutures. With the exception of bilateral common carotid artery 
occlusion, a shamoperation was conducted in which control 
animals were subjected to the same procedure as those conducted 
on the BCCAo operated animals. The rectal temperature was 
maintained at 37.0±0.5oC with a heating pad during surgery.

Behavioral task
Of the twentyfive rats that were subjected to BCCAo, three died 
before behavioral testing. In addition, one rat that showed large 
weight loss that lost their weight 80% than before the surgery was 
excluded from further behavior task.
As a result, ten rats per group were used for behavioral testing 
and neurobiological assays. Twelve weeks after the BCCAo 
surgery, the rats were trained in a Morris water maze task. The 
maze consisted of a round tank, 1.83 m in diameter and 0.58 m 
deep, that was filled to a depth of 35.5 cm with tepid (26±1oC) 
water made opaque by the additional of nontoxic water soluble 
white paint (tempera). A moveable hidden circular platform (12 
cm in diameter) was placed at a fixed location and submerged 
about 2 cm below the water surface. The maze was surrounded 
by white curtains on which black cloth visual stimuli of various 
shapes and sizes were placed. The rats were allowed to swim for 
a maximum 90 seconds in one trial. Every session contained 
five trials across two days and the total training was composed 
of four sessions. Each trial started from different positions in the 
water maze tank. A probe trial was conducted 30 min after the

second session and the fourth session to assess the development 
of spatial bias in the maze; thus, the entire training procedure 
included two probe trials for each rat. During these probe trials, 
the rats swam with the platform retracted to the bottom of the 
pool for 30 s, at which time the platform was raised to its normal 
position for completion of the trial. One week after the Morris 
water maze task with the hidden platform, all rats were tested in a 
Morris water maze tasks, visual platform version. The location of 
the visible platform varied from trial to trial in a single session of 
six training trials. And six rats that did not find the visual platform 
were considered as rats with visual problems and were excluded 
from behavior task analysis. A camera located above the center of 
the maze relayed images to a videocassette recorder and an HVS 
Image Analysis Computer System (Hampton, United Kingdom). 

Brain preparation
Approximately 7 days after the behavioral experiments, six rats 
per group were used for the histology and four rats per group for 
western blot analysis. The rats used for the histology were deeply 
anesthetized with ketamin HCl (30 mg/kg) and xylazine (2.5 
mg/kg) cocktail, after which they were intracardially perfused 
with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% 
paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brain was then removed and 
postfixed in 4% PFA (2 d), cryoprotected in PBS containing 30% 
sucrose (48 h), frozen on powdered dry ice and stored at −70oC 
until processed. And the other rats used for the western blot 
analysis were decapitated and the brain was rapidly removed at a 
4oC surface. The hippocampi and BFCN were dissected, rapidly 
frozen on powered dry ice and stored at −80oC until processed.

Thionin staining
Perfused brain tissues were sectioned on microtome in 40μm 
coronal plane and stored in 4oC PBS. In each set of six serial 
sections, every first section was mounted on slides for thionin 
staining. The sections for thionin staining were mounted onto 
resin coated slide glass, and then dried up for 10 days. Sections 
were hydrated through descending concentration of ethanol 
and subsequently dipped in distilled water twice. Sections were 
stained in thionin solution for few minutes and washed in distilled 
water and ethanol, and then dehydrated through ascending 
concentration of ethanol. Then sections were defatted in Xylene 
and coverslipped with permount reagent.

OX-6 immunohistochemistry
Every second section in each set of six serial sections was used for 
immunohistochemistry (OX6). The monoclonal antibody OX6 
(mouse antiRT1B monoclonal antibody, BD bioscience; 1 : 1,000) 

is directed against the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
class II antigen in the microglia. For OX6 immunoreactivity, 
endogenous peroxidase of free floating sections was quenched 
by 30 min of incubation in 3% H2O2/10% MeOH in PBS. The 
sections were then incubated for one hour at room temperature 
in PBS with 0.3% TritonX 100 containing 10% serum (PBSTS). 
Next, the sections were then incubated with OX6 antibody for 
a further 12 h at 4oC in 3% PBSTS solution. The sections were 
then incubated for 1h in horse antimouse antibody (vector; 1 : 
200) and then for 1h in ExtrAvidin peroxidase conjugate (Sigma 
Aldrich; 1 : 1,000). Finally, the sections were reacted with a Vector 
SG substrate kit (Sigma Aldrich) for peroxidase and mounted 
onto resin coated slides, after which they were dried for up to one 
week. Dried sections on slides were coverslipped with permount 
reagent. For quantifying the activated microglias, OX6 antibody 
detected microglias were counted in corpus callosum and fimbria 
at six sites of brain section per an animal and statistically analysis. 

Western blot analysis
Proteins for the analysis of ChAT, MAPK, and pMAPK were 
extracted in the following manner. Individual tissue samples 
were weighed and then homogenized in 5 vol of icecold buffer 
containing 20 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1.5 mM EDTA, 
40 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (No. 
539131, Calbiochem). Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,800 
g for 30 min at 4oC. The supernatant was then removed from 
each sample, after which an aliquot was taken for determination 
of the total protein concentration using Bradford Reagent. The 
proteins were then separated by SDSPAGE and transferred 
to a PVDF membrane, which was incubated with a primary 
antibody (Ab) against ChAT (1 : 1,000, Cell Signaling), ERK (1 
: 5,000, Cell Signaling), JNK (1 : 5,000, Cell Signaling), p38 (1 : 
1,000, Cell Signaling), pERK (1 : 3,000, Cell Signaling), pJNK (1 : 
3,000, Cell Signaling), and pp38 (1 : 1,000, Cell Signaling). After 
primary incubation, blots were incubated with the horseradish 
peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary Ab (1 : 2,500, Amersham 
Biosciences) and then visualized using an ECL system and 
developed using Hyperfilm (Amersham).The relative expression 
levels of ChAT, MAPK, and pMAPK were determined by 
densitometry and normalization to βactin (1 : 5,000, Sigma), an 
invariant cytoskeletal protein. 

Statistic analysis
A oneway repeated ANOVA and a ttest were conducted 
to assess the effects of chronic BCCAo on the spatial memory 
impairment, OX6 expression, and MAPK changes. All data were 
expressed as the mean±SEM. Any p values that were less than 0.05

were considered significant, unless otherwise specified.

RESULTS

Spatial memory
In the spatial learning with Morris water maze task, search errors 
that are described in detail elsewhere (Gallagher et al., 1993) were 
used to assess the performance accuracy of spatial learning in the 
water maze. During each trial, the distance of the rats from the 
escape platform was sample 10 times per sec, and these values 
were averaged in 1s bins. The cumulative search error was then 
calculated as the summed 1sec averages of this proximity measure 
corrected for the particular start location on each trial. As shown 
in Fig. 1, the shamoperated control rats quickly became proficient 
at locating the submerged platform during the training sessions; 
however, the rats with BCCAo showed poor improvements over 
the course of training compared with the control rats (Fig. 1). 
Oneway repeated ANOVA showed that the between group effects 
(shamoperated control, BCCAo) were significant (F(1,18)=28.13, 
p<0.001) and that the training effects (session) were significant 
(F(3,54)=19.75, p<0.001). There were also interaction effects between 
the group and training (F(3,54)=3.23, p=0.03). 
In addition, although no apparent differences in performance in 
the first probe trial were observed, there were apparent differences 
in performance in the second probe trial, as assessed by the 
percentage of time spent in the target quadrant during the 30 s 
probe. The ttest on the second probe trial showed that the group 
effects were significant (t(18)=4.01, p<0.01). On the first probe 
trial, the percentage of time spent in the target quadrant was less

than 30% in rats of both groups, which indicated that they did not 
fully learn the hidden platform location after 10 trials. 
Swimming speeds during training trials and cue training: there 
were no significant differences in the swimming speeds between 
groups during training (F(1,18)=1.03, ns). The times taken to reach 
the visible platform (in seconds) during the block of cuetraining 
trials (mean±S.E.M.) for the two groups were as follows: sham
operated, 15.05±2.39; BCCAo, (22.44±1.67). There were no 
significant differences between the shamoperated group and the 
BCCAo group (F(1,10)=0.23, p=0.64).

ChAT reduction in BFCN and damaged in fimbria by 
BCCAo
The ChAT expression of BFCN was measured in rats with 
chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. The ChAT expression of BFCN 
of rats with BCCAo was decreased by more than 30% compared 
with the shamoperated group (t(6)=2.43, p<0.05) (Fig. 2A, 2B). 
However, upon staining for MHC class II antigen (OX6), the 
OX6 expression was not shown in the basal forebrain of rats 
with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (Fig. 2C). Conversely, OX6 
expression was increased in the fimbria of hippocampus (Fig. 
2D, 2E), which was statistically different from the shamoperated

Hippocampal neuron and microglial activation in white 
matter area 
Upon thionin staining of the hippocampus, no apparent neuronal 
cell death was observed in rats with BCCAo, but neuronal cell 
death occurred in the CA1 regions of the hippocampus in one animal 
(Fig. 3A). Consistent with earlier reports conducted using BCCAo, 
in the present experiment, expression of OX6 was increased in 
the white matter regions such as the corpus callosum, external 
cap sule, and internal capsule (Fig. 3B). In particular, the number of 
activated microglia in the corpus callosum was statistically higher

MAPK alterations in hippocampi of BCCAo
Increases of ERK and p38 abundances of the hippocampus in 
rats with BCCAo were statistically significant compared with those 
of the shamoperated control (t(6)> −3.96, p<0.01), while JNK 
did not show differences. Phosphorylation of the hippocampus 
MAPK was also analyzed in the BCCAo rats and the control 
rats. The extent of phosphorylation of hippocampus MAPK was 
evaluated with respect to MAPK abundances (pMAPK/MAPK). 
All phosphorylations of MAPKs (pERK, pJNK, and pp38) were 
significantly decreased in the hippocampus of rats with BCCAo in 
comparison with those of the shamoperated control (t(6)>2.51, 
p<0.05) (Fig. 4). 

DISCUSSION

In this experiment, chronic cerebral hypoperfusion was 
induced for 12 weeks by BCCAo of three monthold male Wistar 
rats. Previous studies reported that BCCAo led to reductions 
in cerebral blood flow (CBF) ranging from 30% to 40% of that 
before operation, and this remained at 52~64% between seven 
and thirty days after operation (Tomimoto et al., 2003). Between 
8 and 12 weeks after BCCAo, CBF was slightly reduced or not 
reduced (Ohta et al., 1997; Otori et al., 2003). The most common 
characteristic in rats with BCCAo is neuroinflammatory response 
in white matter and memory impairments (Farkas et al., 2007). 
The results of the present experiment showed that microglia was 
activated in the majority of the brain, especially in white matter 
regions such as the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and external 
capsule, and that memory impairment occurred in rats with 
BCCAo. The results of this experiment are consistent with those 
of earlier reports (Wakita et al., 2002; Takizawa et al., 2003; Farkas 
et al., 2004), which confirms that rats with BCCAo are a suitable

animal model for chronic cerebral hypoperfusion although the 
CBF was not measured in this experiment.
Cognitive deficit in the BCCAo group was measured in the 
spatial learning version of the water maze task; however, rats with 
BCCAo showed comparable swimming speed to those of sham
operated control rats and were also unimpaired in the cued version 
of the task. The results indicate that the deficits are not attributable 
to general motivation or to sensorimotor deficits (Gallagher et al., 
1993). 
It is stated that the level of cerebral hypoperfusion by BCCAo 
is moderate and that the resulting neuronal loss is very regional 
(e.g. hippocampal CA1) (Farkas et al., 2007). It is well known that 
neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA1 cell layer and memory 
impairments occurs in the brain of rats with BCCAo (Ni et al., 
1994; Bennett et al., 1998). However, it is not certain if neuronal 
loss occurs at long survival times after permanent BCCAo is 
induced by the initial phase of cerebral hypoperfusion, or if it is 
the outcome of a longlasting neurodegeneration caused by the 
chronic phase of BCCAo or both. A series of studies have shown 
that the neuronal loss in the CA1 became greater as the survival 
times was increased (Ni et al., 1994), and that the neuronal loss in 
CA1 appeared at four months, but not one month after permanent 
BCCAo. Unlike neuronal loss, the lesion of white matter was 
observed one months after permanent BCCAo and increased 
markedly four months after the operation (Ni et al., 1995). In 
the current experiment, after three months of survival time only 
one animal showed clear neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA1. 
There was no clear neuronal loss in the hippocampus in any of the 
animals. Nevertheless, it is still a possibility that these cognitive 
deficits might be caused by some minor neuronal loss induced by 
BCCAo.
However, white matter injury was apparent in all rats with 
BCCAo. The fimbria of the hippocampus was damaged by 
activated microglia similar to other white matter regions such as 
the corpus callosum, external capsule, and internal capsule. The 
fimbria of hippocampus is part of the hippocampal circuitry and 
consists of a major axon bundle that originates from the basal 
forebrain to the hippocampus. Animals with fimbriafornix injury 
failed to learn the spatial learning task in the Morris water maze, 
but this was recovered with septal cell grafts (Nilsson et al., 1987). 
Dysfunction of septohippocampal systems was implicated in rats 
with BCCAo that showed changes in the central acetylcholine 
and choline contents and decreases of hippocampal cholinergic 
muscarinic receptor and ChAT expression. The ChAT and 
OX6 expression of the basal forebrain was examined in rats 
with BCCAo. The abundances of ChAT were decreased in the 
basal forebrain of rats with BCCAo compared to control rats, but 

activated microglias labeled with OX6 were not observed. When 
combined with earlier reports, white matter damage in the fimbria 
of hippocampus might cause a reduction of ChAT in the basal 
forebrain and alterations of hippocampal signaling. 
Accordingly, we examined the status of MAPK signaling, which 
is a key regulator in neuroinflammation of AD (Haddad, 2004), 
although slight neuron loss was observed in the hippocampus in 
the BCCAo rats in the present experiment. In this experiment, 
ERK and p38 abundances of the hippocampus were increased 
and the MAPKs examined were less phosphorylated relative 
to the control rats. Interestingly, in our recent experiment, 
phosphorylations of hippocampal MAPKs were increased in 
rats with two months survival time after BCCAo (unreported 
observations). These results suggest that MAPKs reflect an 
ongoing process of inflammation in VaD and AD. 
The white matter damage caused by neuroinflammation is 
similar to the major pathological symptoms that occurs during 
VaD (Tomimoto et al., 1996). In addition, these white matter 
lesions in animal models with BCCAo share common features 
with VaD (Ueno et al., 2002; Tomimoto et al., 2003). The present 
study, which examined rats that survived for three months after 
BCCAo, is the first report that ChAT of the basal forebrain was 
decreased and that hippocamal MAPK signaling was altered. 
Interestingly, the findings that ChAT of the basal forebrain was 
decreased are strengthened by the clinical report that patients with 
VaD show cholinergic deficits in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF), and that it had significant benefits in cognition following 
treatment with donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor 
(Roman et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2009). Moreover, the findings that 
the hippocampal signaling pathway related to MAPKs is altered in 
an animal model of VaD provide a new therapeutic target for the 
development of antidementia agents.
