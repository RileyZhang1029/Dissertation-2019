Abstract
The determination of membrane structures presents the structural biologist with many challenges;
however, the last two years have seen major advances in our ability to resolve these structures at
atomic resolution. My goal here is to summarize some of the most recent advances that have
enhanced our prospects for understanding membrane proteins at the level of atomic structure.

Introduction and context
While the number of proteins for which the structures
are known seems to increase exponentially each year
(there are now almost 72,000 structures in the Research
Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics [RCSB] Pro-
tein Data Bank), only a handful of intrinsic membrane
proteins are among this group, despite the fact that they
represent nearly 40% of all proteins. The main reason for
this is a practical one: by necessity, the portion of the
protein that passes through the membrane is hydropho-
bic, so most methods used to extract them are tuned to
maintain the protein stably in a detergent-lipid-protein
micellar structure. In situ, the associated lipid bilayer has
limited the techniques that can be applied to determine
structure to electron microscopy, or electron diffraction
from rarely occurring two-dimensional crystals in the
membrane. X-ray crystallography remains the only general
method that can yield reliable insights into the atomic
structure of membrane proteins of any size, at a resolution
where interatomic atom positions can be determined.
This requires solubilizing membrane proteins in deter-
gent micelles, which then can be crystallized. Alternati-
vely, use of lipidic phases can lead to crystallization in
three dimensions within stacked planar lipid bilayers. As a
result, elucidating the structures of membrane proteins
presents particularly tough challenges. This is reflected
in the recent commitment of funds from the National
Institute of General Medical Sciences to support the
Protein Structure Initiative’s PSI:Biology program aimed

at membrane protein structure determination at no less
than nine centers. This is partly driven by the therapeutic
possibilities since many membrane proteins are impli-
cated in disease, and a better understanding of their
structures will allow more efficient focus on development
of effective drugs, seen in the context of the molecular
structure of their target.

Despite the great technical challenges, a combination of
tenacity, great patience, and ingenuity has produced a
raft of technical advances that have greatly improved
our ability to determine some of these structures at a
resolution useful for assistance in therapeutic develop-
ment. Here, I outline some of the recent achievements in
advancing this most demanding of disciplines.

Most membrane proteins are not expressed at high enough
levels in cells of their natural environment, so determining
their structures relies on inducing overexpression in cells,
or by cell-free synthesis. Once expressed and inserted into
the plasma membrane of cells that can be grown in
quantity, membrane proteins must be solubilized from
the membrane fraction, purified, and conditions opti-
mized to maintain the protein either stably in solution
over several weeks, or in lipidic environments for X-ray
crystallography, electron microscopy, or nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR). A further level of difficulty is associated
with eukaryotic, as opposed to prokaryotic, membrane
proteins that can often be expressed in the membranes of

prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotic membrane proteins are
normally assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum, an
organelle not found in prokaryotes, and delivered to
the cell surface via trafficking mechanisms and further
post-translational processing in the Golgi apparatus. Thus
eukaryotic membrane proteins are almost always are
expressed in eukaryotic cells.

molecular structure. One of the most attractive eukaryotic
expression systems is in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [2,3],
in part because there is a wealth of genetics available and it
is easily grown to high volumes within a week, whereas
expression in HEK (Human Embryonic Kidney) cells can
take 1 month to establish transient expression, and around
3 months to generate stable cell lines.

Expression of membrane proteins
There have been several advances in improving expres-
sion systems in recent years.

One of the more dramatic achievements came with the
structure of the eukaryotic chloride CLC transporter [1].
The elucidation of this structure was remarkable not only
because the CLC transporter is a eukaryotic membrane
protein and was successfully expressed in heterologous
eukaryotic cells, but for the elegant replacement of each
of 30 sites by hydrophobic methionine in 20 different
mutant forms of the protein. These mutants were used
because at limited resolution, which all too often is all
that can be achieved, individual atoms cannot be placed
unambiguously. The protein was then expressed in
selenomethionine, which replaces the methionine sulfur
atoms in the protein with larger selenium atoms to
provide firm experimental assignment of the positions of
mileposts along the protein chain. Thus this process
effectively tagged the protein with visible markers at each
of 30 labeled sites. This was done to unambiguously
resolve potentially controversial assignments. This pub-
lication also dramatically coupled visual images of the
structure and explanation by Rod MacKinnon with
music, as Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Flight of the Bumble Bee”
was used as a beautiful accompaniment to the supple-
mentary movie that illustrates the stochastic nature of
chloride transport. It is a great example of how intricate
mechanisms can truly become accessible to the broad
community.

Several key factors have catalyzed a ready access to the
membrane proteome. Cloning and expression of mem-
brane proteins requires that they be correctly inserted into
lipid bilayers or into the bacterial plasma membrane.
However, while bacteria are excellent for producing many
eukaryotic proteins, they tend to not be so good at folding
them. For this reason, it is better, if possible, in many cases
to use a eukaryotic expression system. Operating in com-
partmentalized cells, eukaryotic membrane proteins are,
however, subject to much more involved trafficking
through the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi appara-
tus, so protein insertion involves additional steps. A major
advance has been the increasing ability to express such
membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells, a key to under-
standing human membrane biology at
the level of

There have also been great improvements in tools to assess
the proteins expressed. Rapid ways of screening expression
levels by fusing a fluorescent protein to the membrane
protein being tested, prior to analysis by fluorescence-
detection size-exclusion chromatography to assess and
eliminate misfolded and aggregated proteins, and even
prior to solubilizing the membrane fraction or purifi-
cation, have been instrumental in rapidly settling on
satisfactory expression methods [4,5]. Multiple homo-
logous genes can be tested and screened for expression in
the membranes of eukaryotic cells including insect cells,
HEK cells, and COS cells. This powerful screening method
for proteins that express better in certain species compared
with others has resulted in several exciting breakthrough
structures of membrane proteins, by first rapidly identify-
ing the species that best expresses for crystallization [6,7].

Gene redesign has become a powerful tool in controlling
the expression level of membrane proteins, making
structure determination possible. In a recent study [8],
two redesigns of a Plasmodium falciparum gene gave us
low-level expression in the plasma membrane fraction of
Escherichia coli, whereas the wild-type gene was not
expressed. This is a common problem in expressing
eukaryotic proteins in bacteria, but it can be circumvented
by “codon optimization”, in which codons that are not
copied well by the bacterium are replaced by those that are,
while producing the same amino acid sequence. We
generated so-called “codon-optimized” genes for 21
different proteins, which led to 7 of the best-expressed
proteins progressing to crystallization trials. However, the
rules for optimizing are still quite variable, and only about
50% of the constructs showed better expression levels than
the wild-type gene, indicating that while it is a powerful
tool, sometimes it requires several constructs for the same
protein to find one that expresses at a higher level. Of the
21, 3 crystallized and 1 yielded a structure within a year of
using the construct. Codon optimization for each of these
proteins was essential for adequate expression, mostly in
E. coli, and for moving towards crystallization trials.

Is the process of codon optimization reproducible? The
sequence of bases is different every time the gene is
designed. In attempts to calibrate effects of gene optimiza-
tion and to extract algorithms that might be predictive
of increased expression, two independent genes were

systematically codon optimized for expression in E. coli.
The different gene variants within each set had as low as
65% DNA identity with the original gene while still
encoding the same wild-type amino acid sequence. Protein
expression levels varied from below the level of detection
to 30% of cell mass. “Machine learning” algorithms were
used to identify 12 variables of the gene and the amino acid
sequence that could be used to build highly predictable
and robust rule-based gene sequences that produce
proteins for crystallization. Each of the important variables
in E. coli was identified to be a specific codon.

Stabilizing the proteins expressed
The hydrophobic nature of their membrane-spanning
regions makes stabilization of expressed membrane pro-
teins more complex than soluble proteins. The impor-
tance of lipids in interacting directly with membrane
proteins has become increasingly recognized, and hence
lipid mixtures are now increasingly being incorporated
into crystallization cocktails. One recipe uses buffers that
contain 0.1mg/ml lipid in a 3:1:1 ratio of POPC:POPE:
POPG (1-Palmitoyl-2-Oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-PhosphoCho-
line: 1-Palmitoyl-2-Oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-PhosphoEthano-
lamine: 1-Palmitoyl-2-Oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[Phospho-
rac-(1-Glycerol)]), obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids,
Inc., and 5mM of n-dodecyl b-maltoside (DDM) as
detergent [9]. This recipe is fairly standard though small
variations are used around these general conditions.

One example of a lipid playing such a direct structural
role emerged in the structure of an engineered beta-2
adrenergic receptor, where a cholesterol molecule
formed the interface between the protein molecules in
the physiological state of the membrane protein [10].

Another such example is in the case of voltage-sensing
domains of potassium channels, where lipid molecules
are critical for correct channel conformation, and crystal
structures determined without lipids show unphysiologi-
cal distortions. NMR has shown that the voltage-sensing
domains interact with short-chain and long-chain
phospholipids in the context of a phospholipid micelle.
The atomic description of the micelle environment and
the difference in affinity for membrane lipids along the
protein surface likely could not have been obtained
without the use of NMR and micelles to stabilize the
protein [11]. This NMR approach is broadly applicable
and opens the door to understanding the structure,
dynamics, and lipid interactions of other integral mem-
brane proteins.

New detergents have also emerged as new tools for
stabilizing and crystallizing membrane proteins. Facial
amphiphiles, such as cholate-based amphiphiles in which

hydrophilic maltose units project from one side of the
rigid and hydrophobic steroidal skeleton, are especially
attractive [12]. Particularly interesting are tandem facial
amphiphiles, termed TFAs, in which two deoxycholate
moieties are coupled together as a covalent head-to-head
dimer [13]. These form small, discrete micelles in water
(with a molecular weight of approximately 13 kDa)
whereas DDM forms much larger micelles (~90 kDa).
The radii of the TFAs were significantly smaller (~19-30Å),
relative to DDM micelles (~34Å). Since the detergent
micelle that surrounds the hydrophobic portions of
membrane protein is essentially liquid-like, the crystal
lattice contacts involve the protein regions that extend
beyond the micelle. Hence the smaller micelle allows
proteins to pack more closely together in the crystal, and
increases the amount of protein outside the smaller
micelle, allowing more access to the protein for lattice
formation. Three TFAs showed excellent ability to main-
tain intrinsic membrane proteins or protein assemblies in
native-like forms in aqueous solution.

Purification techniques
Purification of membrane proteins is critical to success in
crystallization. Affinity purification using nickel affinity
tags, or antibodies to protein antigenic sites, have been
developed to capture poorly expressed levels of eukaryotic
membrane proteins. Size-exclusion chromatography is
then used to select well-folded protein and the correct
oligomeric state of protein complexes. Such columns are
run in detergent buffers to maintain solubility.

Detergents used to stabilize membrane proteins can
interfere with crystallization, so tools to assess how
detergent-free a sample is are another big advance. Triple
and tetra detectors that incorporate right-angle light
scattering, viscosity, and the refractive index can analyze
the separation of the free detergent or detergent/lipid
micelles from the protein-lipid-detergent micelle and can
also, in principle, determine the molecular weight of the
protein-detergent-lipid complex [3,14,15].

Optimizing proteins for structure determination
X-ray crystallography is the commonest technique used
to determine protein structures at a resolution high
enough to provide coordinates for its atoms, and for this
proteins must be crystallized. This is not particularly easy
for cytosolic proteins. For membrane proteins, it is much
harder.

Crystallization in lipidic phases has only recently been
developed but has already become an essential tool in
the arsenal of membrane protein crystallization [16,17].
The method originated from Ehud Landau and Jürg
Rosenbusch in 1996 [18] and was soon followed by

application to bacteriorhodopsin [19]. This protein had
been crystallized and was the target for crystallization
attempts for many years but without adequate resolution
for an atomic structure determination. In the early 1980s,
Larry Miercke, working with Edward Dratz and myself,
had grown large-sized (~1 mm) crystals of bacteriorho-
dopsin in the dark under dim red lights to prevent
photobleaching using detergents; Hartmut Michel simi-
larly had crystallized this readily available, colored
membrane protein. However,
the so-called lipidic
mesophase methods, a term describing lipid molecules
that have properties between those of a conventional
liquid and a solid crystal, proved the key to solving the
structure, which eventually reached very high resolution
(1.55Å) [20], with the subsequent mapping of
the
structural changes in the photoreaction. This method
was also applied to two other haloarchaeal rhodopsins,
sensory rhodopsin and halorhodopsin, also colored
membrane proteins, with success. But until recently, it
remained a boutique method readily applicable to
colored proteins that could be seen inside the clear
viscous phase.

The biophysics of how the method works to “exclude”
membrane proteins into a lamellar phase where they
may crystallize is still an exciting question. But several
developments established the method as broadly applic-
able to all membrane proteins. These include the high-
throughput robotic screening of mesophase materials
for embedded crystals using X-rays that can pick out
crystals of even noncolored proteins, a key step making
the method routinely applicable [21]. Another powerful
approach seeks to assess the ability that membrane
proteins have while in the lipidic bilayer-based meso-
phase and identify conditions that favor them diffusing
in two dimensions as freely as possible in order to find
other protein partners with which to build the two-
dimensional array, which will become the nucleus for
stacking up layers to form a three-dimensional crystal
lattice. A major advance is the application of fluorescence
to assay the diffusion rates, seeking conditions that
maximize the diffusability. Dyes such as hydrophobic

nine (Cy3) are attached to the protein. In this method,
labeled protein in solution (40% w/w) is mixed with
molten monoolein (1-oleoyl-rac-glycerol, Sigma) (60%
w/w) using a syringe lipid mixer to form lipidic cubic
phase (LCP). The fluorescent dye-labeled proteins are
used to assay effects of swelling agents such as butanediol
on the lipid phase, and effects of cholesterol, for example,
in slowing diffusion.

Crystallization in lipid-based bicelles and nanodiscs is a
new development to watch. These methods seek to trap

each membrane protein molecule within a disc of lipid
bilayer of finite size. The size of a bicelle is determined by
the mass ratio of shorter chain lipids that form the rim
around the disc; the nanodisc dimension is determined
by a surrounding protein. Thus the method has the
advantage of bilayer-based methods of preserving integ-
rity of the membrane protein, and the advantage of
the ability to diffuse in three dimensions in the process
of forming a three-dimensional lattice. In the case of
bacteriorhodopsin, clear density for a CHAPSO molecule
inserted between protein subunits is seen within the
layers indicating that an important interaction between
lipid and protein has been preserved within the bicelle by
the cholesterol-like detergent. The ability to grow crystals
at room temperature, rather than under defined tem-
peratures used to stabilize these heterogeneous states,
significantly expands the applicability of bicelle crystal-
lization [22]. Bicelle lipid/amphiphile mixtures tend to
form small bilayer discs at low temperature, and form a
perforated lamellar phase at higher temperature. The
transition temperature depends on the lipid/amphiphile
composition. In the perforated lamellar phase, the mix-
tures form gels, but at lower temperatures the mixtures
are liquid and can be easily manipulated. Consequently,
proteins in bicelles can be handled at low temperatures
just like proteins in detergent, and crystal trials can be
performed in the same manner as detergent crystal-
lization. Thus, the bicelle approach has the advantage of
convenience in handling membrane proteins within a
bilayer, but in solution as opposed to being embedded in
a large deformable lipid-bilayer membrane. This allows
them to diffuse freely so they can find each other and
build a three-dimensional lattice while maintaining the
protein in a bilayer-like environment (as it would be in a
natural membrane).

Nanodiscs, like bicelles, are yet another template for
solubilizing membrane proteins with some advantages
over liposomes or detergent micelles in terms of size and
stability [23]. The nanodisc is a noncovalent assembly
of phospholipids, typically POPC, dipalmitoylphospha-
tidylcholine (DPPC), dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine
(DMPC), and a genetically engineered “membrane scaf-
fold protein” based on the sequence of human serum
apolipoprotein AI. They are formed by removing detergent
from a mixture of the membrane protein, lipid, and
detergents. The phospholipid bilayer is composed of two
opposed leaflets, or layers in which all lipid chains are
pointed in the same direction. The nanodisc is constrained
by two molecules of membrane scaffold protein that wrap
around the edges of the discoidal structure in a belt-like
arrangement, such that one membrane scaffold protein
coats each of the hydrophobic alkyl chains of each leaflet.
To date, these bilayer-based, diffusible structures have

been used to best advantage with NMR methods, or for
assessing the ligand binding or native state of membrane
proteins.

Protein engineering has long been used to make pro-
teins more amenable to crystallization. Truncations of
the hydrophilic, often flexible termini of membrane
proteins have often been used as an aid to crystal-
lization since they tend to remove a sometimes flexible
region that may impede formation of an ordered
three-dimensional lattice. This can be done by trun-
cating the gene expressed, or by mild treatment with
proteolysis, as was used in the determination of the
human aquaporin 4 structure [24]. Another approach is
insertion of mutations that alter the protein sequence
in a manner that stabilizes one particular conformation
versus others, and screening of several to find those
that might rigidify otherwise flexible regions. With the
beta-adrenergic receptor, the insertion of the mutation
E122W was found to make the protein stable as detec-
ted by the raised temperature of unfolding, measured
as described above. Chimeric insertions were also used
to insert a small, fairly rigid soluble protein into a
supposedly flexible loop of the membrane protein under
the theory that more ordered and rigid components
make a more ordered crystal lattice, and hence yield
better resolution in the structure. The soluble protein
chosen was a lysozyme, chosen because it had its N- and
C- termini close to each other in the soluble protein
favoring a short circuit of a short excised loop. This
strategy proved successful for this and other G-protein
coupled receptors [10].

A powerful new strategy is to try to stabilize the membrane
protein along with a screen of different engineered
constructs, ligands, or lipids to assess their ability to
increase the thermal stability of membrane proteins. This
can be carried out in a high-throughput format using
fluorescent dyes. In a recent application [25], exposure and
reactivity of native cysteines embedded in the protein
interior were used as a sensor to determine the tempera-
ture of overall unfolding of the protein as the temperature
is raised. In this case, a fluorescent label is used to detect
thermal “melting” of the membrane protein by covalent
attachment to cysteines that become available upon
melting. The thermal information gained by investigation
of the protein stability landscape can be used to guide
construct design, to select stabilizing ligands or lipids, to
assess detergents, and to plan crystallization strategies
based on increasing the thermal stability [25]. This LCP-Tm
protocol offers a clear quantitative method of selecting
conditions that are most stabilized by the variation in
conditions and therefore the most likely to crystallize
since they are more likely to be in a more stable state.

Future prospects
The last few years have seen dramatic progress in the
techniques and prospects for determining structures of
membrane proteins and how they function in response to
binding a natural ligand or a drug, and specifically those
selected for their impact on a particular biological or
biotherapeutic application. At last, scientists can begin to
approach the mechanisms of transmembrane processes
involved in neurochemistry, metabolic signaling via
G-protein coupled receptors, receptors that signal pain
whose inhibition might assuage their debilitating effects
in acute conditions, and neuroreceptors and transporters
in mental
illness. Understanding the transmembrane
processes involved in mental
illness perhaps most
poignantly illustrates the potential applications for the
future. Today’s drugs act on membrane protein receptors
and transporters, yet we often don’t know which receptors,
and we know little of what effect their binding evokes, or
how many other targets are also affected. Such drugs are
discovered by trial and error in the only animal model that
relays a sense of mental disturbance: humans. We can now
just begin to decode the action of today’s drugs on each
specific receptor or neurotransmitter transporter. These
structures, and the purified membrane proteins that are
produced even before the structures are resolved, will
lead us to develop a rational approach to the treatment
of schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder.
The introduction of a raft of effective new tools for the
membrane structural biologist reflects the ingenuity of
the current generation and lays the groundwork for
application to numerous diseases.
