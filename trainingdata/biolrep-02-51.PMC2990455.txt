Abstract
Recent work has not only defined the origin of the direct cortico-motoneuronal output to the upper
limb but has also identified some of the cortical networks that engage the corticospinal output during
movement. A surprising finding is that some corticospinal neurons show ‘mirror-like’ properties and
are actively modulated not only during self-movement but also during action observation.

Introduction and context
Two central features of corticospinal function are that it
reflects the increasingly important role of the expanded
neocortex in interactions with the spinal cord and that
these interactions mediate not only its traditional role as
part of the motor system but also its role in somatosen-
sory, autonomic, developmental, and trophic functions
[1,2]. All of these functions depend upon a complex
interaction between spinal and supraspinal centres. This
interaction is present not only in the normal, healthy
state but also is seen after damage:
injury to the
corticospinal tract results in profound changes at both
cortical and spinal levels [3,4].

Major recent advances
Mouse motor cortex studies using powerful optogenetic
and other techniques show that a key factor determining
the pattern of intracortical connections is the output
target of layer V neurons, including the corticospinal
projection. For example, these approaches have shown
that projections from layer II/III predominantly inner-
vate the deeper parts of layer V and differentiate between
corticostriatal and corticospinal outputs [5,6]. For the
first time, we can begin to get some real insights into the
intracortical circuitry that computes these different
outputs.

It is probable that most corticospinal fibres terminate on
spinal interneurons, providing the corticospinal tract
with a range of functions, including the filtering afferent

input, and modulation of activity in central pattern
generators and of reflex excitability [1,7]. However, it is
unlikely that these interneurons act as a simple relay of
corticospinal activity to motoneurons.

A characteristic output of
the primate corticospinal
system is the direct cortico-motoneuronal (CM) projec-
tion, which provides the motor cortex with direct
influence over the activity of spinal motoneurons [1].
This CM system is particularly well developed in
advanced primates, including humans, but is entirely
absent in mice and rats [1]. CM projections were first
detected by Leyton and Sherrington [8,9] using silver
staining of degenerating terminals after motor cortex
lesions. Rathelot and Strick [10,11], using their elegant
retrograde transneuronal labelling technique, have for
the first time defined the cortical origin of the CM
projection. Most of this projection appears to arise from
the caudal region of M1, in the bank of the central sulcus.
These studies have also resolved a long-standing
controversy as to whether there is punctuate representa-
tion in M1 of outputs to particular muscles, with the
argument very much resolved in favor of widespread
projections to individual muscles which overlap exten-
sively with those to other muscles. This distributed
overlapping organisation is probably essential in provid-
ing the combination and recombination of motor
outputs required for flexibility in skilled hand control
and begins to explain the complex mapping of motor
output found both in M1 and in premotor areas [12,13].

These studies also highlighted that most CM projections
are derived not only from the largest layer V neurons (the
classical Betz cells) but also from corticospinal neurons
with much smaller cell bodies. This is an important
finding: a complete understanding of corticospinal
function must take into account the fact that the vast
majority of fibres in the tract are thin, slowly conducting
axons.

their discharge during action observation, and this might
be involved in some way in the inhibition of our own
actions (that is, the prevention of unwanted imitation of
the actor by the observer). It is important to note that, so
far, there is little evidence for direct CM effects arising
from secondary motor areas such as PMv [27] and
supplementary motor area [28]. Whether or not CM cells
exhibit mirror-like properties is yet to be determined.

What are the inputs that recruit corticospinal neurons
during skilled hand movements? These neurons receive a
sophisticated and complete somatosensory representa-
tion of the upper limb and sensory inputs applied to the
passive monkey are capable of driving M1 neurons at
rates similar to those seen during active movement [14].
The study of transcortical reflexes has now matured into
modern ideas about optimal feedback control [15,16].

Visual inputs about objects in our peripersonal space are
obviously of major importance for such movements.
There are no direct visual inputs to M1; rather, they are
processed through complex pathways involving the
posterior parietal cortex and premotor areas [17]. The
cortico-cortical interactions with M1 are dominated by
connections with dorsal (PMd) and ventral premotor
(PMv) cortices [18]: in monkeys, PMv has been shown to
exert powerful excitatory and inhibitory modulation of
M1 corticospinal outputs to the hand which are grasp-
specific [19], and these results have recently been
confirmed in human studies with transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) [20,21]. The ‘visuomotor grasping
circuit’ [22] provides a means of transforming visual
inputs related to an object’s properties into outputs from
M1 which are appropriate for efficient grasp of the same
object.

A novel feature of corticospinal neurons was recently
demonstrated by Kraskov and colleagues [23] in the
subdivision of PMv which has been termed area F5 [24].
This area is, of course, distinguished by the presence of
mirror neurons. First discovered in the 1990s by
Rizzolatti and Gallese and their colleagues [25], these
fascinating neurons respond during both active grasp
and the passive observation of similar actions carried out
by another individual. Kraskov et al. [23] found that
corticospinal neurons in PMv also showed clear ‘mirror-
like’ properties, modulating their discharge while the
monkey grasped but also when an experimenter grasped.
This discovery means that mirror-like activity is also
transmitted to the spinal cord and this might explain
changes that have been observed in the excitability of
both cortex and spinal cord while we observe the actions
of others [26];
interestingly, about half of the PMv
neurons reported by Kraskov et al. showed suppression of

During action observation, mirror neuron activity is
accompanied by complete absence of any muscle activity
in the hand or arm [23]. But if the corticospinal output is
important for the generation and execution of voluntary
movements when we ourselves move, how is it possible
to recruit these neurons in the complete absence of
movement when we watch someone else moving? It has
long been known that corticospinal activity can be
dissociated from electromyography activity [29] and that
when movements do follow corticospinal discharge, the
delays are typically 80-100 ms, much longer than known
physiological delays between cortex and muscle
(approximately 10 ms). Clearly, corticospinal
inputs
alone do not recruit spinal motoneurons and must work
in parallel with other descending and segmental
mechanisms [1].

Future directions
So we still need to know a lot more about how
corticospinal activity is transformed to motor outputs
at the spinal level; conjoint recordings at both supra-
spinal and spinal levels are needed [30,31]; they are
extremely challenging but certainly worth the effort. TMS
work in humans has shown that there are interesting
activity-dependent
features of CM transmission to
motoneurons [32] which we have yet to fully under-
stand. We need to get closer to the CM synapse itself.
Because of the distinctive nature of the primate versus
rodent motor system, much of this work will continue to
require the use of non-human primates.
