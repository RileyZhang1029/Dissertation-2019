Abstract: The aerobic actinomycetes are a large group of soil-inhabiting bacteria that occur worldwide. Some of them are 
the  main  cause  of  two  important  diseases,  nocardiosis  and  actinomycetoma.  To  identify  the  prevalence  and  geographic 
distribution of aerobic actinomycetes in soil of Qazvin province, a study was carried out during 2006-2007. In this study, 
the incidence and diversity of medically important aerobic actinomycetes was determined in 300 soil samples of different 
parts of Qazvin. The suspensions of superficial soil samples were prepared by adding of normal saline, streptomycin and 
chloramphenicol  and  the  supernatants  were  cultured  on  brain-heart  infusion  agar  and  Sabouraud's  dextrose  agar  contain 
cycloheximide. The isolated microorganisms were  examined by Gram  and acid-fast stains and were identified biochemi-
cally and morphologically. Of 96 aerobic actinomycetes isolates identified, Actinomadura madurae and Streptomyces so-
maliensis were the most frequently isolated species each representing 19.8% of isolates, followed by Nocardia asteroides 
(15.6%), N. otitidiscaviarum  (9.4%), N. brasiliensis (7.3%), A. peletieri, S. griseus,  and Nocardia spp.  (each 5.2%),  and 
N.  transvalensis,  Nocardiopsis  dassonvillei,  Actinomadura  spp.  and  Streptomyces  spp.  (each  3.1%).  To  the  best  of  our 
knowledge, this is the first report on epidemiological  investigation of medically important aerobic actinomycetes  in soil 
samples from Iran. In recent years, mycetoma and nocardiosis have been increasingly reported in Iran. The results showed 
that medically important actinomycetes occur in the  environment  of Iran and soil could be potential source of actinomy-
cotic infections.

INTRODUCTION  

  Actinomycetes  are  found  worldwide,  maintaining  a  
saprophytic  existence  in  soil  and  other  natural  habitats.  Soil 
is  a  major  reservoir  for  retention  of  bacteria  and  fungi  and 
wind  can  transmit  these  agents  in  companion  with  dust  and 
dirt  into  lung  or  skin  and  produce  diseases  like  nocardiosis, 
sporotrichosis, chromomycosis, mycetoma etc [1].  

  The  aerobic actinomycetes are a various group of Gram-
positive, branching, filamentous, obligately aerobic and rela-
tively  slow-growing  bacteria.  Actinomycetes  are  considered 
as Spore-forming bacteria with indication of health problems 
[1]. It is widely recognized that aerobic actinomycetes abun-
dantly  found  in  soil  and  cause  opportunistic  infections  in 
human and animals and even cause death in some occasions. 
It  has  been  known  that  Streptomyces  species  can  produce 
secondary  metabolites  [2].  Toxic  metabolites  isolated  from 
Streptomyces  and  Nocardiopsis  isolates  have  shown  to  be 
mitochondriotoxic  in  spermatozoa  [3].  It  is  recognized  that 
some  isolates  of Streptomyces griseus  produce  valinomycin, 
a  toxin  that  cause  mitochondrial  swelling,  activity  loss,  and 
apoptosis in human natural killer cells [4].

Streptomyces  species  may  be  implicated  in  respiratory 
 
disorders of individuals  living  in moldy houses [5]. Increase 
in  the  infections  by  aerobic  actinomycetes,  specially  Nocar-
dia genus and diverse array of clinical illnesses specially the 
systemic  and  disseminated  forms  of  nocardiosis  in  cancer, 
tuberculosis,  diabetes,  AIDS  and  patients  under  treatment 
with immunosuppressive drugs and broad spectrum antibiot-
ics  in  the  world  reveal  importance  of  detection  of  these 
agents more than ever [6]. Actinomycetes present in soil like 
Streptomyces  somaliensis,  Nocardia  brasiliensis,  N.  asteroi-
des,  Actinomadura  peletieri,  A.  madurae also  can  be  inocu-
lated  in  the  skin  in  a companion  with dust and dirt and may 
cause actinomycetoma [6, 7]. Mycetoma and nocardiosis are 
sporadically  spread  in  Iran  and  treatment  of  mycetoma  
essentially depends on the etiologic agent  involved. In order 
to  determine  the  identities  and  diversity  of  soil  actinomy-
cetes  in  Qazvin  district  of  Iran,  a  descriptive  analytical  
study  conducted  to  find  out  if  soils  are  potential  sources  
of  actinomycetes  infections.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge, 
this  is  the  first  report  on  epidemiological  investigation  
of  distribution  of  aerobic  actinomycete  populations  in  soil  
samples from Iran.  

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY  

  Qazvin  is  a  province  situated  on  the  northern  west  of 
capital,  Tehran.  The  average  summer  temperature  ranges 
from  25  to  35°C  and  humidity  is  up  to  50%.  Qazvin  city 
covering an area of 50 sq. kms and has been divided into 25 
regions (Fig. 1).

  Over  the  period  of  the  study  (March  2006  to  March 
2007),  total  300  soil  samples  were  collected  from  25  loca-
tions  of  the  city,  that  is,  12  samples  were  randomly  taken 
from 350 to 400 meters interval in each region. After remov-
ing  the  surface  loose  litter  layer  (approximately  top  4  cm), 
the soil samples were taken from a depth of 5 to 10 centime-
ters  of  the  superficial  layers  in  each  location.  The  soil  type 
was  sandy-clay  in  all  over  the  city.  Soil  samples  were  num-
bered  and  put  in  a  sterilized  paper  sack,  transferred  to  the 
Mycology  Laboratory  of  the  School  of  Medicine,  Qazvin 
University  of  Medical  Sciences,  where  they  were  homoge-
nized and spread in trays to be cleaned of leaves, roots, small 
stems, etc. These samples were sieved (2 mm  mesh)  and air 
dried at 25 °C for 7 days. Then five grams of each soil sam-
ple  were  added  to  a  test  tube  containing  10  ml  of  sterile 
physiologic  saline  (0.9%  NaCl)  and  mixed  for  3  minutes. 
The suspension was incubated for 15 minutes and thereafter, 
3  ml  of  the  supernatant  solution  was  transferred  to  another 
sterile  test  tube and 1.5 ml of antibiotic solutions of strepto-
mycin  and  chloramphenicol  (0.2  mg/ml)  was  added  and  in-
cubated for half an hour after being stirred up. This solution 
was then shaked again and one drop (0.05 ml) was added to 
a Sabouraud's dextrose agar medium (BioMeriéux, Marcy-1, 
Etoil,  France),  containing  0.5  g/l  of  cycloheximide  and  an-
other  drop  to  brain-heart  infusion  agar  containing  0.5  g/l  of 
cycloheximide  immediately,  and  incubated  at  35°C  for  2-3 
weeks.  Representative  colonies  were  selected  and  streaked 
on  new  plates  of  aforementioned  culture  media.  Actinomy-
cetes  on  the  plates  were  identified  as  colored,  dried,  rough, 
with  irregular/regular  margin,  generally  convex  colony.  The 
plates were kept in a 35°C incubator and examined for up to 
2 or 3 weeks for possible growing, although the majority was 
detected  within  the  first  several  days  of  incubation.  During 
this  period,  the  wrinkled  colonies  of  yellow,  red,  orange,  
and white to cream colors suspicious of actinomycetes were 
considered  and  in  order  to  purification  of  actinomycetes,  
the  streak  plate  method  were  used.  After  isolation  of  the  

pure  colonies  based  on  their  colonial  morphology,  colour  
of  hyphae,  color  of  aerial  mycelia,  they  were  individually 
plated on the same agar media.  

the 

examination  of 

actinomycetes  
  Morphological 
was  done  by  using  cellophane  tape  and  cover  slip-buried 
methods.  The  mycelium  structure,  color  and  arrangement  
of  arthrospore  on  the  mycelium  were  examined  using  light 
microscopy  under  oil  immersion  (1,000  x).  Since  a  single 
method  could  not  identify  all  actinomycete  isolates  to  
the  species  level;  therefore,  a  combination  of  methods  was 
necessary.  If  branched  and  delicate  filaments  specific  of 
actinomycetes  were  seen,  they  were  isolated  and  examined 
for  partial  acid-fastness  by  staining  with  the  carbolfuchsin 
modified  acid-fast  stain  with  a  weak  (0.5-1%)  sulfuric  acid 
decolorizing  solution.  Moreover,  conventional  biochemical 
tests  and  physiological  criteria  such  as  the  capability  to  
degrade  the  organic  compounds  such  as  casein,  tyrosine, 
xanthine,  hypoxanthine  and  starch  as  substrates,  the  utiliza-
tion of urea and different carbon sources as well as growth in 
4% gelatin medium were studied in order to reach a possible 
classification  to  the  species  level.  Gelatin  hydrolysis  was 
determined  by  stabbing  a  loopful  of  organism  about  one  
cm into a nutrient gelatin tube (BBL), which were incubated 
at  35°C  in  air  for  up  to  7  days. Detection  of  hydrolysis  was 
accomplished  by  placing  the  tubes  at  4°C  for  15  min  and 
then tilting each tube at a 45° angle. The test was considered 
positive  if  the  gelatin  was  liquefied.  For  urea  hydrolysis,  
a heavy loopful of bacteria was suspended in 0.5 ml of a me-
dium  containing  1  g  urea  and  1  ml  of  a  cresol  red  solution 
(0.5% [wt/vol]) in 100 ml phosphate buffer (0.005 M, pH 6). 
Tubes were incubated at 35°C and checked after 1 and 2 days 
for a pink color shift representing a positive reaction.  

RESULTS 

  Of  300  soil  samples  studied,  a  total  of  96  actinomycete 
isolates,  representing  9  species,  were  diagnosed  including

Nocardia  asteroides,  N.  otitidiscaviarum 
(Formerly  
N.  caviae),  N.  brasiliensis,  N.  transvalensis,  Actinomadura 
peletieri,  A.  madurae,  Streptomyces  somaliensis,  S.  griseus 
and  Nocardiopsis  dassonvillei.  The  remaining  11  isolates 
were  identified  at  the  genus  level  including  Nocardia  (five 
isolates),  and  Actinomadura  and  Streptomyces  (each  3  iso-
lates).  Table  1  shows  the  numbers,  diversity  and  prevalence 
of  the  actinomycete  populations  in  soil  samples  from  these 
25 locations. A total of 34 (35.4%) Nocardia isolates, repre-
senting four species, were identified. Of which, N. asteroides 
surpassed the other three species of Nocardia, accounting for 
44.1%  of  all  Nocardia  species,  and  ranked  third  in  preva-
lence (15.6% of all isolates). All Nocardia isolates exhibited 
partial  acid-fastness,  varying  from  weak  to  strong.  Colony 
morphology  of  Nocardia  spp.  were  glabrous,  wrinkled  
or granular with color of orange, yellow to white. Regarding 
N.  transvalensis,  both  of  the  isolates  tested  decomposed  
hypoxanthine,  tyrosine,  and  urea  and  were  negative  for  
casein decomposition.

  The  Streptomyces  colonies  were  slow  growing,  aerobic, 
folded,  glabrous  or  chalky,  with  earthy  odour  and  aerial  
mycelia  of  different  colors.  All  streptomycete  isolates  were 
acid-fast  negative  and  Gram-stain  positive.  The  degradation 
of the substrates casein and tyrosine by S. somaliensis and S. 
griseus  was  positive  but  for  xanthine  was  variable.  Micro-
scopically, it was observed that  the morphology of the spore 
chains  varied  depending  on  the  species,  which  was  straight 
or flexuous, hook or coil form. 

  N. brasiliensis, Nocardiopsis dassonvillei, S. griseus  and 
S. somaliensis were the species capable of liquefying gelatin. 
N. transvalensis and Nocardiopsis dassonvillei were the only 
species  could  breakdown  starch.  The  percentage  of  species 
may  be  presented  by  overall  rate  (positive  number/300  soil 
samples). 

DISCUSSION 

In  this  study,  aerobic  actinomycetes  present  in  soil  were 
 
isolated  frequently  from  soil  of  different  parts  of  Qazvin 
province.  Actinomycetes  may  cause  various  infections  such 
as  nocardiosis  and  actinomycetoma,  which  deserve  special 
attention but delay in diagnosis result  in deterioration of the 
patient's  condition  and  mortality  rate,  especially  in  cases  of 
metastatic nocardiosis.  

 
In  the  Finnish  Health  Authority  guidelines,  existence  of 
spore-forming  actinobacteria  in  the  environments  has  been 
considered  as  a  risk  to  human  health  [1].  The  literature  is 
crowded with case reports on actinomycotic infections espe-
cially  mycetoma.  Several  reports  from  various  geographical 
locations of Iran have shown that actinomycotic mycetoma is 
a  sporadic  disease,  frequent  etiological  agents  of  which  are 
N. asteroids and Actinomadura madura [7-11]. In this study, 
out  of  300  soil  samples,  96  actinomycete  isolates  (32%) 
yielded,  which  A.  madurae  and  S.  somaliensis  were  of  the 
predominant  isolates  (Table  1).  Whereas  in  a  study  carried 
out  in  Rome,  out  of  200  soil  samples  examined,  only  12 
actinomycete  species  (6%)  including  seven  isolates  of  N. 
asteroides, four of A. madurae and one of Nocardiopsis das-
sonvillei were isolated [12]. According to a study carried out 
on 64 cases of actinomycetomas over 33 years  in Iran, Acti-
nomadura madurae has been the cause of 10.2% of the cases 
[7].  Furthermore,  Denguezli  et  al.  has  reported  that  of  10 
actinomycetoma  cases  from  Tanzania,  nine  cases  were 
caused by A. madurae [13].  

 
In this study, 40.6% of soil samples in Qazvin, contained 
different  species  of  Nocardia,  which  is  much  higher  than 
what  reported  in  Patiala,  India,  that  is  8%  [14].  Nocardiae 
are  ubiquitous  in  the  environment  and  well  known  as  sapro-
phytic  soil  inhabitants.  Identification  of  Nocardiae  to  the 
species  level  appears  to  be  of  significant  benefit  to  the  pa-
tients’  management  and  defining  the  geographic  distribution 
of  these  organisms.  Members  of  the  genus  Nocardia  are 
most commonly associated with a diverse array of opportun-
istic  infections  in  both  immunocompromised  and  immuno-
competent  hosts  [15].  In  a  study  carried  out  during  1972  to 
2005  in  Iran,  most  of  (84.5%)  all  mycetoma  cases  were 
actinomycetoma  [7],  which  is  in  concordance  with  the  re-
sults  of  Dieng et  al.  and  Denguezli  et  al.  [13,16].  From  the 
available  data,  mycetomas  were  abundant  among  farmers  in 
rural  areas  of  Iran  and  the  disease  mainly  has  been  seen  in 
foot, which shows that the causative agents mostly implanted 
from  soil  or  plants  traumatically  [7,  8,  10].  Similar  results 
have been found in Argentina [17] and Tanzania [13]. 

  Most of the nocardiosis cases are caused by N. asteroides 
[15] and in the current study, this species surpassed the other 
Nocardia  species  and  had  allowed  it  to  become  the  most 
common  Nocardia  species  isolated  from  soil.  These  results 
are  comparable  with  those  of  the  Kuwaiti and  Italian  studies 
[12,  18].  Nocardiae  are  usually  acquired  through  inhalation 
and  infrequently  by  direct  skin  inoculation  [15].  A  study 
from  South  India  showed  that  contact  with  soil  and  sands 
contaminated  with  N.  asteroides  has  been  the  reason  for 
1.4% of corneal lesions cases [19]. Nocardiosis produced by 
Nocardia  spp.  present  in  soil  were  unusual  in  the  past,  but

they  are  in  increase  in  recent  years  with  the  increase  in  the 
number  of  immune  deficiency  patients  [20].  Curry  (1980] 
stated  that  38  percent  of  people  inflicted  with  pulmonary 
nocardiosis  lacked  any  background  [21].  Different  forms  of 
Nocardiosis  in  various  immunocompromised  patients  have 
been recognized in Iran [personal  communication].  Over the 
past decades in Iran, the frequency of pulmonary nocardiosis 
infections  caused  by  N.  asteroides  has  increased  [22-25]. 
These  patients  typically  had  predisposing  factors  such  
as  pemphigus  vulgaris,  kidney  transplantation,  chronic  
lymphocytic  leukemia  and  Wagner  vasculitis.  According  to 
Munoz  et  al.  [26],  N.  asteroides  and  N.  brasiliensis  have 
been the most common agents of nocardiosis in HIV-positive 
patients.  

 
In  this  study,  N.  otitidiscaviarum  was  the  second  most 
prevalent  Nocardia  spp.  and  was  accounted  for  26.7%  of  
all Nocardia species, but based on the literature, this species 
has  infrequently  been  recovered  from  soil  throughout  the 
world.  It  has  also  been  postulated  that  N.  otitidiscaviarum  
is  less  pathogenic  than  other  species  of  Nocardia  [27]  and 
represented only between 1.3 and 4.8% of clinical Nocardia 
isolates in the studies from Europe, Japan and the USA [28]. 
Based on a study on 264 actinomycetoma patients from west 
of  Bengal,  N.  otitidiscaviarum  has  had  a  lower  incidence  of 
etiological agents [29].  

 
In  our  study,  Nocardia  brasiliensis  constituted  20.6%  
of  all  Nocardia  species.  This  Nocardia  species  produces 
infection  most  frequently  in  immunocompromised  patients, 
but  it  can  cause  cutaneous  and  disseminated  infection  in  
immunocompetent  patients  too  [30].  A  review  of  actinomy-
cetomas  cases  from  1972  to  2005  in  Iran  demonstrated  
that  N.  brasiliensis  has  been  the  cause  of  86.6%  of  the  
cases,  which  have  mostly  been  associated  with  tropical  
environments [7]. In the United States also, N. brasiliensis is 
the second most common isolate of Nocardia [6].  

 
In  the  current  study,  N.  transvalensis  and  Nocardiopsis 
dassonvillei  were  the  uncommon  (each  3.1%)  actinomycete 
species  isolated.  It  has  been  stated  that  the  specific  natural 
habitat  of  N.  transvalensis  has  not  yet  been  identified  [6]. 
Nocardiopsis  species  have been  observed  in  indoor  environ-
ments  and  shown  to  produce  antimicrobial  and  bioactive 
agents. Nocardiopsis dassonvillei isolated from lung biopsies 
of farmers suffering from alveolitis [3]. 

  This is the first report on isolation and characterization of 
medically  important  aerobic  actinomycetes  in  soil  of  Iran. 
This  study  can  possibly  reveal  actinomycetes  agents  that 
engaged  in  actinomycotic  diseases  in  Iran.  Familiarity  with 
the  epidemiology of unusual Nocardia species  may  increase 
early identification in cases of nocardial infection. Moreover, 
it  is  obvious  that  efforts  for  the  isolation,  characterization 
and study on actinomycetes from different ecological niches 
can  be  a  milestone  for  the  discovery  of  novel  species  that 
may yield potential human and veterinary pathogens.
