The biochemical properties of mouse LSECtin, a glycan-
binding receptor that is a member of the C-type lectin
family found on sinusoidal endothelial cells, have been
investigated. The C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain
of mouse LSECtin, expressed in bacteria, has been used in
solid-phase binding assays, and a tetramerized form has
been used to probe a glycan array. In spite of sequence
differences near the glycan-binding sites, the mouse recep-
tor closely mimics the properties of the human receptor,
showing high afﬁnity binding to glycans bearing terminal
GlcNAcβ1-2Man motifs. Site-directed mutagenesis has
been used to conﬁrm that residues near the binding site
that differ between the human and the mouse proteins do
this binding speciﬁcity. Mouse and human

LSECtin have been shown to bind Ebola virus glyco-
protein with equivalent afﬁnities, and the GlcNAcβ1-
2Man disaccharide has been demonstrated to be an effec-
tive inhibitor of this interaction. These studies provide a
basis for using mouse LSECtin, and knockout mice
lacking this receptor, to model the biological properties of
the human receptor.

Introduction

LSECtin is one of a group of glycan-binding receptors
encoded near the end of human chromosome 19 (Liu et al.
2004). Other receptors in the cluster include the dendritic and
endothelial cell receptors dendritic cell-intercellular adhesion

molecule 1 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-SIGN
related receptor (DC-SIGNR) (L-SIGN) and the structurally
related Fc-binding receptor CD23 (Soilleux et al. 2000). All
of these receptors contain C-type carbohydrate-recognition
domains (CRDs). Although a related cluster is found in the
syntenic region of chromosome 8 in mouse, there are major
differences in the organization of several of the genes, with
eight mouse DC-SIGN-related genes replacing the two human
genes (Powlesland et al. 2006). These differences make it dif-
ﬁcult to identify clear mouse-human orthologs. In contrast,
the human and mouse LSECtin genes appear to be much
more closely related, although the two sequences differ at key
residues that have been proposed to be involved in selective
binding of ligands (Powlesland et al. 2008; Tang et al. 2009).
The mRNA for LSECtin is found in a restricted pattern,
with the primary sites of expression being sinusoidal endo-
thelial cells in liver and lymph nodes (Liu et al. 2004),
although expression has also been reported in suitably stimu-
lated dendritic cells and macrophages in vitro and in the
Kupffer cells (Domínguez-Soto et al. 2007; Domínguez-Soto
et al. 2009). Unlike many glycan-binding receptors, LSECtin
does not appear to function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis
(Gramberg et al. 2008; Powlesland et al. 2008), although it
can undergo antibody-induced internalization in myeloid cells
(Domínguez-Soto et al. 2007). Several biological functions
for LSECtin mediated by its ability to interact with speciﬁc
glycans have been investigated. In vitro studies demonstrate
that human LSECtin can provide a route for Ebola virus and
SARS coronavirus infection of cells initiated by binding of
the viral envelope glycoproteins
LSECtin to glycans of
(Gramberg et
al. 2007;
Powlesland et al. 2008). Studies in mice indicate that mouse
LSECtin is able to bind T cells through glycans on the CD44
T-cell surface marker (Tang et al. 2010). This interaction leads
to suppression of T-cell responses and knockout mice lacking
LSECtin show increased sensitivity to liver damage mediated
by T cells following acute injury, suggesting that LSECtin
plays a role in protection of the liver from immune attack
(Tang et al. 2009). Finally, it has been suggested that receptor
expressed on myeloid cells could be involved in antigen
capture and presentation (Domínguez-Soto et al. 2007).

rapid evolution of function in this region of the genome, as
well as the presence of some potentially important differences
in the sequences of human and mouse LSECtin, there is need
for empirical evidence comparing the biochemical properties
of the two receptors in order to provide a foundation for extra-
polating results from mice to humans.

In the studies described in this manuscript, biochemical
characterization of mouse LSECtin is presented and close
similarity in the sugar-binding properties of the two receptors,

Results
Expression and characterization of the CRD
from mouse LSECtin
LSECtin is a type 2 transmembrane protein in which the
C-type CRD resides at
the C-terminal end of the protein
(Figure 1A). An initial survey of the distribution of LSECtin
expression was undertaken using the polymerase chain reaction
to amplify the LSECtin-coding region from a panel of cDNAs
with a pair of primers that lie just outside the protein-coding
region at each end (Figure 1B). Expression was detected exclu-
sively in the liver, as was previously observed for human
LSECtin in a survey of a similar set of human tissues (Liu
et al. 2004). This distribution is consistent with the idea that
mouse LSECtin performs a function similar to human LSECtin
in sinusoidal endothelial cells, although it was not possible to
document expression in lymph node as well because of the dif-
ﬁculty of obtaining a suitable cDNA library.

The CRD from mouse LSECtin was initially expressed in a
bacterial system previously used for production of the human
protein (Powlesland et al. 2008), in which the portion of the
cDNA encoding the CRD is inserted immediately after the
bacterial ompA signal sequence. The signal sequence allows
folding of the CRD in the periplasm, so the protein could be
extracted and puriﬁed directly by afﬁnity chromatography on
immobilized sugars (data not shown). However, for the mouse

CRD, more efﬁcient expression was obtained by production
of the CRD as inclusion bodies that were dissolved in guani-
dine hydrochloride and renatured by dilution and dialysis
(Figure 1C). Similar yields were obtained by puriﬁcation on
either fucose- or mannose-Sepharose. However, due to the
relatively weak afﬁnity of individual CRDs for the monosac-
charide ligands, a 10-mL column was required to achieve
effective puriﬁcation. The CRD was used directly in the solid-
phase binding assays.

For characterization of the binding speciﬁcity of mouse
LSECtin by glycan array analysis, a tetrameric form of the CRD
was created by attaching a C-terminal biotinylation sequence to
the CRD and co-expressing the CRD and biotin ligase
(Figure 2A). The resulting protein was puriﬁed by afﬁnity
chromatography as for the untagged protein. Incubation of an
excess of biotin-tagged CRD with ﬂuorescently labeled strepta-
vidin resulted in formation of tetramers that could be puriﬁed
away from uncomplexed CRDs by re-chromatography on a
fucose-Sepharose. The tetrameric protein is efﬁciently retained
on a 1-mL afﬁnity column, whereas uncomplexed CRD washes
through. The bound CRD–streptavidin complex was then eluted
from the afﬁnity column with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) (Figure 2B).

Probing of version 4.0 of the glycan array created by the
Consortium for Functional Glycomics (Blixt et al. 2004)
revealed strong signals for a very selected subset of glycans
(Figure 2C). The common feature of all of these glycan is the
presence of terminal GlcNAcβ1-2Man disaccharides. Every
oligosaccharide that gives a positive signal on the array con-
tains one or more such terminal structures. Only two glycans
that contain terminal GlcNAcβ1-2Man yield poor signals on
the array, and in each case, these are bi-antennary oligosac-
charides in which one branch is extended, which may lead to
steric hindrance of binding of
the remaining exposed
GlcNAcβ1-2Man group.

The speciﬁcity of mouse LSECtin for the GlcNAcβ1-2Man
disaccharide was further demonstrated in competition binding
assays (Figure 3A and Table I). In these experiments, the CRD
was
immobilized on polystyrene wells and probed with
125I-labelled mannose-bovine serum albumin (BSA), a neoglyco-
protein ligand with a high density of terminal mannose residues.

Based on the measured inhibition constants, the afﬁnity for the

charides tested.

Comparison of ligand-binding properties of human
and mouse LSECtin
The initial characterization of mouse LSECtin binding to
glycan ligands suggested that its ligand-binding speciﬁcity is

closely analogous to that of the human protein (Powlesland
et al. 2008). Testing of the pH sensitivity of ligand binding
indicated that, as with human LSECtin, the binding activity of
mouse LSECtin is enhanced at low pH (Figure 3B). The com-
bined results thus suggest close similarity in the mechanism
of ligand binding to human and mouse LSECtin.

The observed high degree of similarity between the human
and mouse proteins was not necessarily predicted based on

sequence comparisons. Previous modeling studies led to the
hypothesis that an important contribution to high afﬁnity binding
of terminal GlcNAcβ1-2Man residues might be interaction of the
N-acetyl group with the side chain of
residue Trp259
(Powlesland et al. 2008). Surprisingly, this residue was found to
be substituted by arginine in the mouse protein (Figure 4A). The
similarity of the ligand-binding activities of the human and
mouse proteins does not support the hypothesis that interactions
of the aromatic side chain are important. The role of this residue
was tested directly by creating mutant versions of the human
CRD in which Trp259 is substituted with arginine, as found in
the mouse protein, or with alanine. Comparison of binding of the
wild-type and mutant proteins
to the exposed terminal
GlcNAcβ1-2Man disaccharides of Ebola virus glycoprotein con-
ﬁrmed that the absence of the tryptophan side chain does not sig-
niﬁcantly affect the interaction (Figure 4B).

Human and mouse LSECtin binding to Ebola virus
glycoprotein and characterization of simple sugars as
inhibitors
The similarity in the binding speciﬁcities of human and
mouse LSECtin suggested that,
like the human protein,
mouse LSECtin might be a target for binding to the surface
glycoprotein of Ebola virus. The Ebola glycoprotein has been
shown to bear an unusually large number of under-processed
glycans with terminal GlcNAcβ1-2Man that are not further
modiﬁed by addition of galactose (Powlesland et al. 2008).
A direct binding assay conﬁrmed that human and mouse
LSECtin interact with the Ebola glycoprotein-Fc fusion
protein with very similar afﬁnities of 0.52 µg mL−1 for the
mouse protein and 0.48 µg mL−1 for
the human protein
(Figure 5). This result provides important evidence that the
mouse protein is a potentially useful model for human Ebola
virus interaction with human sinusoidal endothelial cells.

Based on the results in Figure 3, showing that the simple
GlcNAcβ1-2Man disaccharide competes at micromolar con-
centrations for binding of neoglycoprotein ligands to mouse
LSECtin, as well as published work showing similar afﬁnities
of the human protein (Powlesland et al. 2008), the disacchar-
ide was tested for its ability to compete for binding of both
receptors to the Ebola virus glycoprotein. The results demon-
strate that the KI of the disaccharide is in the low micromolar
range for both human and mouse receptors (Figure 6 and
Table II). This result provides an important lead toward the
development of high-afﬁnity inhibitors of Ebola virus binding
to sinusoidal endothelial cells as well as conﬁrming that
studies in the mouse will be relevant to humans as well.

Discussion

The close similarity in the biochemical properties of human
and mouse LSECtin is in stark contrast to the widely diver-
gent properties of the mouse orthologs of DC-SIGN. The
difference in the evolutionary history of these two protein
families, in spite of their proximity in mammalian genomes,

evolutionary pressures. One interpretation of the conserved
binding properties of LSECtin is that this receptor may bind a
conserved endogenous glycan ligand, whereas DC-SIGN is
evolving to interact with different pathogen glycans. This
interpretation is consistent with the fact that DC-SIGN func-
tions as an endocytic receptor able to a direct pathogen uptake
and presentation to the immune system (Engering et al. 2002;
Guo et al. 2004), whereas LSECtin does not have constitutive
endocytic activity (Gramberg et al. 2008; Powlesland et al.
2008). In this scenario, the binding of endogenous ligands,
such as CD44 on T cells, would be the primary function of
LSECtin, which has been hijacked by certain pathogens such
as Ebola virus.

independent

Few other glycan-binding receptors show such conserved
properties between species as
is documented here for
LSECtin. DC-SIGN is one of many receptors that show
extreme divergence between human and mouse (Powlesland
et al. 2006). The CD33 family of siglecs represent another
example of
radiation of a group of glycan-
binding receptors (Crocker et al. 2007), and some receptors,
such as the Kupffer cell receptor and prolectin, are present in
rodents but not humans or vice versa (Fadden et al. 2003;
Graham et al. 2009). Aside from the evolutionary and func-
tional implications of the conservation of LSECtin function,
the close similarities in their ligand-binding properties, as
well as the similar restricted distribution of tissues in which
they are expressed, provide a ﬁrm foundation for use of

Analysis of LSECtin expression
The polymerase chain reaction was carried out using a mouse
cDNA panel and Advantage 2 DNA polymerase from
ClonTech-Takara
(Saint-Germain-en-Laye,
France) under the standard reaction conditions described by
the manufacturer. Forward and reverse oligonucleotide
primers, obtained from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK), were 5-
ccagggctggacgccaccaccacc-3′ and 5′-ctggggtcactaaagcatgcact
ggtcagg-3′. Following an initial denaturation at 95°C for 1
min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s and 68°C for 1 min were
executed, and the products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel
containing ethidium bromide.

Expression system for CRD from mouse LSECtin
A cDNA for mouse LSECtin was isolated by polymerase
chain reaction ampliﬁcation from a mouse liver cDNA library
from BD Biosciences (Oxford, UK). Initially, an expression
system using the ompA signal sequence was constructed by
direct analogy with the method previously used for the human
protein (Powlesland et al. 2008). For more efﬁcient expression,
synthetic oligonucleotides were combined with restriction frag-
ments from the cDNA to insert the region encoding the CRD
into vector T5T (Eisenberg et al. 1990), with codons for an
initiator methionine followed by an alanine codon and then
residue 161 of mouse
the cDNA sequence beginning at
LSECtin, which encodes the sequence SerCysGlu at
the
N-terminal end of the CRD. For expression of biotin-tagged
protein, the C-terminal end of the cDNA was similarly modi-
ﬁed by insertion of synthetic oligonucleotides so that

expression vector codes for a protein in which the C-terminal
cysteine residue of LSECtin is followed by the sequence
GlyLeuAsnAspIlePheGluAlaGlnLysIleGluTrpHisGlu

1993). All sequences were conﬁrmed by sequencing on an
Applied Biosystems 310 genetic analyzer.

The CRD of LSECtin was expressed in Escherichia coli
strain BL21(DE3) grown in the Luria–Bertani broth contain-
ing 50 µg mL−1 ampicillin. For addition of biotin, the cells
were also transformed with plasmid birA, which encodes the
gene for biotin ligase (Chapman-Smith and Cronan 1999),
and chloramphenicol at 20 µg mL−1 was included in the

medium. For protein production, a 200 mL starter culture was
diluted to 6 L and grown at 37°C to OD550 of 0.7, at which
point additions were made to achieve ﬁnal concentrations of
100 µg mL−1 isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside and 12.5 µg mL−1
biotin. After further growth for 2.5 h at 37°C, bacteria were
harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 3000 × g, washed in
400 mL of 10 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.8, and collected by centrifu-
gation for 10 min at 6000 × g. The ﬁnal pellet was resus-
pended in 200 mL of 10 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.8, and sonicated
at full power in a Branson Model 250 sonicator for 6 × 30 s,
with cooling on ice between sonication steps. The insoluble
inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation for 15 min
at 10,000 × g and dissolved in 100 mL of 6 M guanidine
hydrochloride containing 100 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.0, by brief
sonication. Following addition of 10 µL of 2-mercaptoethanol,
the mixture was stirred for 30 min at 4°C and centrifuged for
30 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was dialyzed against
three changes of 2 L of loading buffer (150 mM NaCl, 25
mM CaCl2, 25 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.8), centrifuged for 5 min at
8000 × g and 30 min at 1,00,000 × g, the supernatant was ﬁl-
tered through glass wool and applied to a 10 mL column of
mannose- or fucose-Sepharose (Fornstedt and Porath 1975).
The column was washed with 16 mL of loading buffer and
eluted in 2 mL fractions with elution buffer (150 mM NaCl,

Screening of glycan array
Approximately 250 µg of biotin-tagged CRD in 6 mL of
eluting buffer was adjusted to 25 mM CaCl2 and incubated
overnight at 4°C with 150 µg of Alexa 488-labeled streptavi-
din (Invitrogen). The complex was re-applied to a 1-mL
column of mannose-Sepharose, which was rinsed with 5 mL
of loading buffer and eluted with 0.5-mL aliquots of eluting

150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris–Cl

For competition binding assays and pH-dependence assays,

CRD was applied to streptavidin-coated wells that were incu-
bated with unlabeled Ebola glycoprotein-Fc fusion protein at
various dilutions followed alkaline phosphatase-protein A
conjugate and p-nitrophenylphosphate substrate (Powlesland
