The interactions between glycosaminoglycans
(GAGs),
important components of the extracellular matrix, and
proteins such as growth factors and chemokines play criti-
cal roles in cellular regulation processes. Therefore, the
design of GAG derivatives for the development of innova-
tive materials with bio-like properties in terms of their
interaction with regulatory proteins is of great interest for
tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Previous
work on the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) has focused
on its interaction with heparin and heparan sulfate, which
regulate chemokine function. However, the extracellular
matrix contains other GAGs, such as hyaluronic acid
(HA), dermatan sulfate (DS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS),
which have so far not been characterized in terms of their
distinct molecular recognition properties towards IL-8 in
relation to their length and sulfation patterns. NMR and
molecular modeling have been in great part the methods
of choice to study the structural and recognition properties
of GAGs and their protein complexes. However, separately
these methods have challenges to cope with the high
degree of similarity and ﬂexibility that GAGs exhibit. In
this work, we combine ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, NMR
experiments, docking and molecular dynamics simulations
to study the conﬁgurational and recognition properties of

Introduction

The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of various charged
and uncharged biopolymers and plays a crucial role in cell
adhesion and proliferation. In addition, growth factors, cyto-
kines and chemokines mediate numerous important cellular
functions. Proper tissue function has to rely on the transport
and availability of these regulatory proteins across the ECM,
which is strongly mediated by the interactions between the
proteins and the biopolymers of the ECM. Therefore, inter-
actions between ECM and functional proteins play a decisive
role in the regulation of processes such as hemostasis, anticoa-
inﬂammation (Gandhi and
gulation,
Mancera 2008). Particularly important are the interactions
between proteins and the negatively charged polysaccharides
of the ECM, the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). It has been
suggested that GAGs may act as a storage site for highly dif-
fusive functional proteins to aid their presentation to the
respective receptor (Thiery and Boyer 1992). Thus, the ECM
may provide a trap that sequesters secreted chemokines and
prevents their diffusion from the inﬂammation site (Middleton
et al. 1997).

Given the importance of the interaction between regulatory
proteins and GAGs, it is astonishing that this topic represents
a truly white spot in structural databases that contain tens of
thousands of high-resolution protein structures obtained by
X-ray crystallography or NMR, but fewer than 100 GAG–
protein complexes (Imberty et al. 2007). Co-crystals of
protein and oligosaccharides are difﬁcult to obtain as GAGs
may feature a high degree of conformational ﬂexibility,

especially regarding their glycosidic linkages. NMR assign-
ments of oligosaccharides are complicated due to the highly
repetitive nature of these molecules. Furthermore, chemical
synthesis of pure oligosaccharides is extremely difﬁcult due to
their anomeric stereochemistry and the high complexity in
terms of different possible structures that these molecules may
offer (Gandhi and Mancera 2008). In nature, GAG confor-
mational ﬂexibility is further enhanced by variations in their
sulfation patterns as well as by the contribution of metal ions
and pH on their
interactions with proteins (Gandhi and
Mancera 2008). Although controlling the GAG sulfation
pattern is experimentally extremely challenging,
it can be
addressed in computer simulations. Therefore, molecular mod-
eling has also contributed largely to our understanding of
GAG–protein interactions (Imberty et al. 2007; Gandhi and
Mancera 2008; Sapay et al. 2011).

Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemotactic cytokine that is able to
trigger inﬂammation by recruiting and activating neutrophil
granulocytes (Larsen et al. 1989). Leukocytes are typically
activated by binding of a respective chemokine to a
G protein-coupled receptor. However, IL-8 also strongly inter-
acts with GAGs mediating the activation of
leukocytes.
Previous work has focused on the interaction of IL-8 with
heparin and heparan sulfate, the most highly sulfated natural
GAGs. One study has investigated the interaction of IL-8 with
di- and trisulfated heparin-derived disaccharides using solution
NMR spectroscopy (Kuschert et al. 1998). A general binding
region in the C-terminal helix and a proximal loop was ident-
iﬁed. Further, a horseshoe-like binding of heparan sulfate to
IL-8 has been suggested from experimental work, where the
GAG moiety runs parallel to the helix axis (Spillmann et al.
1998). Computational studies could reproduce the interaction
sites of IL-8 and heparin and identify the residues that interact
with the sugar moiety (Bitomsky and Wade 1999). Protein
consensus sequences for the interaction of GAG with proteins
have been identiﬁed (Cardin and Weintraub 1989), but binding
of
unique
(Lortat-Jacob et al. 2002). For IL-8, an orientation of the GAG
molecule perpendicular to the helical axis bridging the two
subunits in the IL-8 dimer has been proposed by compu-
tational work (Bitomsky and Wade 1999; Lortat-Jacob et al.
2002), which contrasts the above-mentioned horseshoe-like
model (Bitomsky and Wade 1999; Krieger et al. 2004).

Although the interaction of IL-8 with heparin and heparan
sulfate appears to be an important regulator of chemokine func-
tion, it should not be forgotten that the ECM also contains
other GAGs such as hyaluronan (HA), chondroitin sulfate (CS)
and dermatan sulfate (DS) (Figure 1) in much higher amounts
(Gandhi and Mancera 2008). Some of these molecules are
highly abundant as part of proteoglycans and undergo distinct
dynamics in tissue (Schiller et al. 2001; Scheidt et al. 2010).
While HA carries only one carboxylate group per disaccharide
unit, the other GAGs feature an additional sulfate group.

In our work, we have used ﬂuorescence and NMR spec-
troscopy, docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
to study the molecular recognition properties of IL-8 with a
variety of HA, DS, CS and their sulfated derivatives. These
GAG derivatives hold an interesting potential for the develop-
ment of innovative matrix materials with bio-like properties

Interaction of IL-8 and GAGs by NMR and molecular modeling

for tissue engineering applications and regenerative medicine.
Such matrices are designed for the controlled delivery of bio-
active proteins (Chung and Park 2007; Lee and Shin 2007;
Dvir et al. 2011). The idea is to modify natural or synthetic
matrix materials with GAGs to provide the scaffolding
material with an environment that attracts regulatory proteins.
The interaction strength between the matrix-associated GAGs
and the regulatory proteins should be ﬁne-tuned so that the
matrix slowly releases these molecules to bind to the cellular
receptors. Furthermore, an environment should be created that
attracts speciﬁcally important regulatory proteins but is less
attractive for unwanted pro-inﬂammatory regulators. For a
rational design of such “intelligent” matrix materials, basic
research has to address the details of the interaction of differ-
ent GAGs with the respective regulatory proteins.

Results and discussion
Experimental binding
Experimental determination of GAG binding to IL-8 by
ﬂuorescence spectroscopy. We analyzed the binding strength of
negatively charged GAG hexasaccharides to IL-8. To this end,
the tryptophan ﬂuorescence intensity of IL-8 was recorded as a
function of GAG concentration. GAG binding induces a
decrease in Trp ﬂuorescence and for chondroitin-6-sulfate
(CS6) a slight shift in the ﬂuorescence emission maximum.
Experimental ﬂuorescence titration curves are shown in
Figure 2. Fluorescence intensity reaches a plateau value
typically at around 20 µM GAG suggesting KD values in the
low µM range. We determined experimental KD values using a
binding model as described in the Methods section of 5.5 ±
1.3 µM for HA, 5.5 ± 1.0 µM for DS, 4.8 ± 0.7 µM for CS4
and 1.4 ± 0.4 µM for CS6 for the GAG hexasaccharides.
Overall, these data show that all GAGs exhibit rather high
afﬁnity to IL-8. Differences in the overall strength of the decay
in ﬂuorescence intensity indicate slightly different binding
the ﬂuorescence
geometry for the four GAGs. For CS6,
intensity drops off quickly and reaches a plateau value already
at (cid:1)5 µM,
the KD value might actually be
smaller than the 1.4 µM determined by our model, which does
not seem to describe the binding of CS6 to IL-8 correctly.

Resonance assignment and 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra of

IL-8 interaction, we carried out solution NMR experiments on
15N-labeled IL-8. NMR resonance
and the
three-dimensional structure determination of
IL-8 (residues
1–72) have been reported before (Clore et al. 1989, 1990).
Here, we have conﬁrmed the assignment by carrying out an
nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and a total
correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiment and further
assigned the additional ﬁve N-terminal residues of the IL-8 (1–
77) variant. A 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence
(HSQC) spectrum of uniformly 15N-labeled IL-8 (1–77) with
the full assignments is shown in Figure 3. All resonance lines
are narrow and well-dispersed as reported in the literature.

study showed a strong interaction with IL-8. Exemplary, the
response of residue E75 of IL-8 to GAG binding is shown in
the insets A–D. There is only a negligible chemical shift
change upon titration of
IL-8 with HA hexamers (A).
Nevertheless, our binding measurements as well as literature

136

data (David et al. 2008) show that HA interacts with IL-8,
apparently without larger structural alterations in the protein.
In contrast, much stronger effects were observed when IL-8
was titrated with CS4 (B), CS6 (C) and DS (D) indicating
that the negatively charged sulfate group of CS or DS has a
pronounced effect on the backbone structure of residue E75
of IL-8. We have also carried out HSQC experiments in the
presence of higher salt concentration (500 mM NaCl), which
showed essentially the same chemical shift changes upon
GAG titration (data not shown).

In order to map out the IL-8 residues that showed strongest
interaction with the respective GAG, chemical shift pertur-
bation charts were plotted (Figure 4). As inferred from
Figure 3A, titration with HA did not result in any signiﬁcant
chemical shift perturbations in the HSQC spectra. In contrast,
titration with both CS4 (Figure 4A) and CS6 (Figure 4B) as
well as with DS (Figure 4C) showed signiﬁcant chemical shift
changes. Two protein regions experiencing strong changes in

shift changes
occurred for residues K59, V66, V67, K69, A74 and E75.
Overall, the chemical shift changes observed are moderate but
compare well with what has been observed for the interaction
between heparin disaccharides and IL-8 (Kuschert et al.
1998).

In principle,

the NMR titration experiments should also
provide binding curves similar to those measured in the ﬂuor-
escence experiments (Figure 2). However, the IL-8 concen-
tration necessary for meaningful NMR experiments needs to
be on the order of 1 mM, which is (cid:1)3 orders of magnitude
higher than the KD and therefore renders its determination by
NMR very difﬁcult. The experiment is further hampered by
the fact that part of the protein is lost due to aggregation. This
has also been observed in other studies of GAG–chemokine
interaction (Zhao and Liwang 2010). Therefore,
in NMR
studies that typically require large protein concentration, just
dimeric GAGs are used (Kuschert et al. 1998; Zhao and
Liwang 2010). For the sake of higher biological relevance, we
decided to carry out the GAG binding measurements with
hexameric
protein
aggregation and the last titration steps showed the precipi-
tation of IL-8–GAG complexes. As a result, no binding
constants could be determined from the NMR titrations.

Previous work identiﬁed a BxxxBxxBB binding motif of
heparin and heparan sulfate to the α-helix of IL-8, which
involves the basic residues R65, K69, K72 and R73. In
addition, H23 and K25 of the loop connecting the N-terminal
region with the ﬁrst strand of the β-sheet appear to be impor-
tant binding regions (Kuschert et al. 1998; Bitomsky and
Wade 1999; Lortat-Jacob et al. 2002). Although no signiﬁcant
changes in the HSQC spectra resulted from HA titration, both
DS and CS binding caused these basic residues to shift their
spectral position. This suggests a similar binding motif for the
monosulfated GAGs studied here in comparison to heparin
and heparan sulfate. However, residues R65, K72 and R73
did not show a very pronounced response to titration with
CS4, whereas distinct effects are observed for CS6.

changes were
observed for A74 and E75, which are directly adjacent to the
two basic residues at the end of the consensus sequence. It
should be emphasized that the NMR shifts report the response
of the protein backbone to GAG binding, which takes place at
the end of the basic side chains. Apparently, GAG binding to
IL-8 causes moderate structural alterations of the C-terminal
α-helix of
IL-8, which also affects residues that do not
directly interact. In particular,
the negatively charged E75
appears to undergo considerable structural changes. This is
likely related to the electrostatic repulsion of the negatively
charged carboxylate group of E75 and the sulfate groups of
CS, which causes a structural change of
residue.
Compared with CS, the response of IL-8 to DS binding is
more moderate, which might be related to the orientation of
the negatively charged groups on the GAG (vide infra).
DS binding also caused residue H23 to shift signiﬁcantly,
which was also reported to be involved in heparin binding
(Kuschert et al. 1998; Bitomsky and Wade 1999; Lortat-Jacob
et al. 2002).

ones. Further, determining the exact structure of protein–GAG
complexes by NMR is challenging due to the highly repetitive
nature of the sugar moieties, which introduces a considerable
ambiguity. Here, computer-derived models and simulation
provide great complementarity as even a sparse set of exper-
imental constraints can largely improve the predicting power
of modeling and simulation techniques. Further, any given
sugar molecule with a speciﬁc sulfation pattern can be studied
computationally prior
synthesis.
Therefore, in order to complement our experimental studies
and to extend them with regard to other sulfated sugar mol-
ecules, we carried out extensive computational analysis on
GAGs with natural (HA, CS4, CS6, heparin and DS) and
non-natural sulfation patterns binding to IL-8. First, we have
used GAG tetrasaccharides since nowadays available docking
approaches are restricted to the number of degrees of ligand’s
freedom and, consequently, to the GAG length. In order to be
more consistent with our NMR studies, we characterized the
inﬂuence of GAG length on the binding to IL-8 and, in par-
ticular, we also analyzed the binding of those GAG hexasac-
charides that were studied experimentally.

Computational binding
Although the NMR approach allows studying the interaction
of IL-8 with various GAG site speciﬁcally, it is limited to
those sugar molecules that are readily available. However, for
biotechnological applications, GAGs with non-natural sulfa-
tion patterns, such as sulfated derivatives of HA and CS, may
provide more favorable interaction properties than natural

Docking of GAGs to IL-8. We have observed that docking
heparin/heparan sulfate disaccharides to the IL-8 heparin-
binding site (Kuschert et al. 1998) does not reveal binding
speciﬁcity that could help suggesting a most probable binding
pose for
longer GAGs (data not shown). These results
indicated the prevalence of unspeciﬁc electrostatic interactions
between sulfate and carboxylic groups of GAGs with

however, clearly differ. In spite of the substantial differences in

common and highly scored binding pose for all GAGs.

in previous studies on hexameric heparin docking to IL-8
(Krieger et al. 2004). We ﬁnd the same pose prevailing in the
top 10 docking solutions also when docking is carried out with
the 24 explicit water molecules in the binding site (Table I).
There is a correlation (adjusted R2 = 0.47, P < 0.05) between
the pose abundance for docking with and without water for
different GAGs, supporting the idea that this pose does not
appear randomly and is not purely electrostatically driven,
since the abundance of the pose is not correlated with the
charges of the GAGs. The second-most representative pose
obtained by docking is an antiparallel pose to the above
described (Supplementary data, Figure S1), conﬁrming that the
complexity of GAG docking can be partly explained by the
high symmetry of GAGs (Forster and Mulloy 2006). To
summarize, the combination of complementary experimental
and theoretical approaches allowed us to discern a distinct,
highly scoring and representative common binding pose to
IL-8 for all studied GAGs, even though being of different
length and containing different
sulfation patterns. This
observed binding pose is in agreement with previously
proposed binding modes for heparin on IL-8.

MD and energetic analysis of GAG–IL-8 complexes. We used
MD to simulate the GAG–IL-8 complexes obtained for the
best scoring binding poses and to analyze their stability. We
observed a clear improvement of binding with increasing
GAG sulfation (Figure 5A) independently of the constraints
applied to the IL-8 backbone. Calculated binding energies for
other natural GAGs, DS and heparin, which have one and
three sulfates per disaccharide, respectively, do not differ from
binding energies of other GAGs with the same level of

sulfation (Figure 5A). Despite this, the inﬂuence of individual
sulfated positions is challenging to estimate. For example, a
more favorable binding energy for HA4 in comparison to HA
and HA6 cannot be unambiguously attributed to speciﬁcity or
to inaccuracy of the method, which is especially sensitive to
electrostatics and is dramatically affected by small changes of
charged atoms positions. Moreover,
sampling,
which is an issue for MD approaches in general, could
strongly affect the molecular mechanics poisson-Boltzmann
solvent accessible surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations as
well. These considerations based on the obtained results lead
to the conclusion that binding differences for similar GAGs
observed with MM-PBSA calculations should be analyzed
in the best case, be complemented with
carefully and,
to allow drawing
additional experimental data in order
conclusions on interactions speciﬁcity. For
instance, our
calculations show that both CS6 tetramer and hexamer bind
stronger to IL-8 than the corresponding CS4 tetramer and
hexamer, which is in agreement with our NMR experimental
data (Figure 3). This is a good example on how the
complementation of theoretical and experimental approaches
represents a valuable approach for
the

molecular recognition properties of GAG–protein systems.

To understand the impact of individual IL-8 residues to
the binding of GAGs, we carried out generalized born
poisson-Boltzmann

results for all complexes in the simulations with and without

from these simulations (Figure 5B) agree with the literature
(Kuschert et al. 1998), demonstrating the crucial role of resi-
dues H23, K25, R65, K69, K72 and R73 for binding GAGs
also in terms of energetics (six lowest points in the plot). These
results implicitly conﬁrm the reliability of
the calculated
binding pose. Observation of the unfavorable energy impact of
some residues (i.e. negatively charged E75 close to the binding
site) could serve as valuable information for protein engineer-
ing aimed to improve the binding mode of GAGs to IL-8.

The data we obtain on energy decomposition per residue
for hexasaccharide binding agree very well with our NMR
data on CS6 binding (Figure 6A and B) and partially for CS4
binding, which corroborates the predicted common binding
pose. Residues R65, K72 and R73 were not observed by
NMR to be responding essentially to CS4 binding in compari-
son to CS6. MD simulations with no constraints on the
protein showed signiﬁcantly less favorable free energies of
interaction for these residues with CS4. Thus, though increase
in GAG sulfation in general improves binding, both exper-
imental and computational methods also detect speciﬁc differ-
ences for binding GAGs with the same level of sulfation,
which are not purely electrostatically driven.

Comparison of bound GAG conformations with free GAGs.
To explore the conformational space available to free GAGs
in solution and to compare it with that in their bound state,
we carried out MD simulations of hexameric GAGs in
explicit solvent and plotted the sampled glycosidic linkage
dihedrals. In general, both glycosidic linkages for HA and CS

derivatives explore a larger area in conformational space with
the increase in sulfation (Supplementary data, Figure S2). The
reason for higher conformational ﬂexibility for GAGs with
higher sulfation could be explained by the increase in the
number of possible local energy minima emerging after the
introduction of additional groups due to the formation of
stabilizing hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges. HA derivatives
form (cid:1)1.6 times more hydrogen bonds in comparison to
CS derivatives because of
the 4-OH group equatorial
conﬁguration participating more often in intramolecular
interactions.

To explore the differences between the conformational
space visited by glycosidic linkages in the simulated free
GAGs and the experimentally available in the PDB, we ana-
lyzed the data for bound HA and CS4 (Supplementary data,
Figure S3). Simulated GAG glycosidic linkage conformations
overlap very well with PDB data except for two cases. The
fact that one of these (for the type 1 of glycosidic linkage for
HA, PDB ID: 1LXM) is not sampled in the free GAG confor-
mational space could be explained by the presence of an unsa-
turated bond between C’4 and C’5 in the derivative of the
glucuronic acid used to obtain this structure, which probably
affects the geometry of the glycosidic linkage. The second
(CS4_1, PDB ID: 3CE9), where φ (cid:1) 180°, can be reached by
most free GAGs.

Comparison of the glycosidic linkages in the bound form
of the predicted common binding pose (Supplementary data,
Figure S2) also shows that most of the observed confor-
mations for bound GAGs resemble free GAG conformations
or converge to them in the simulation. Therefore, our results
suggest that GAG glycosidic linkage conformations do not
change signiﬁcantly upon IL-8 binding compared with free
GAGs. This has signiﬁcant implications for the further devel-
opment of theoretical and experimental approaches to study
GAG–protein interactions, as it may assist in the process of
discriminating accessible GAG glycosidic linkage confor-
mations and,
therefore, help simplifying the treatment of

Elongation of GAGs bound to IL-8. In order to explore
the effect of GAG elongation on binding to IL-8, we used 8-,

high afﬁnity. MM-PBSA calculations showed that HA463′

values for correlation between different GAGs in the same

tetrasaccharide is the minimal GAG
unit required to achieve speciﬁc binding to IL-8. Therefore,
conclusions made for tetrameric GAGs could be extrapolated
to longer GAGs bound to IL-8. Nevertheless,
these
speculations analyzing the results obtained after GAG
elongation should be taken with special care because of two
aspects. First, GAG structure minimization after each step of
elongation can lead the system to be trapped in a local
minimum. Second, even if elongation of a bound GAG does
not signiﬁcantly affect the enthalpic component calculated by
MM-PBSA, there is still an entropic component of binding,
which is expected to vary signiﬁcantly for GAGs of different
length and that

Docking GAGs to dimeric IL-8. We performed docking

in which the GAG is in extended conformation and located in
a groove between the two C-terminal α-helices (Figure 6C).
Since the C-terminal α-helices of each IL-8 subunit in the
dimer are antiparallel, both parallel and antiparallel docking
poses of GAGs are symmetric, represented equally and can be
considered as the same pose. Our MD simulations showed
that this pose is energetically unfavorable (ΔG ≥ 0 kcal/mol),
which could be explained in terms of the proximity of E68
and E75 residues to the bound GAG. On the contrary, in the
case of monomeric IL-8, the side chains of these negatively
charged residues are oriented away from the bound GAGs,
which avoids the unfavorable interactions remaining very
close to the GAG-binding site in the dimer. Free energy
decomposition shows a very unfavorable impact on binding
of

to previous studies (Bitomsky and
Wade 1999; Lortat-Jacob et al. 2002), we did not ﬁnd the
perpendicular binding pose to dimeric IL-8 to be well
clustered and highly scored but rather a pose agreeing with
the horseshoe-like model (Spillmann et al. 1998), where two
GAGs in the calculated binding pose could be connected with
a spacer, which does not interact with IL-8.

Dimerization of IL-8 vs binding to GAGs. According to the
available data from literature, GAG binding affects the
process of dimerization for chemokines (Jansma et al. 2010),
in particular for IL-8, which in turn leads to changes in their
receptor binding (Das et al. 2010). We performed MD
simulations with the dimeric IL-8, where one or both IL-8
subunits were complexed to HA463′ of the length of 4, 6, 8,
10 and 12 monosaccharide units in the predicted common
binding pose. Our results show that binding of one GAG of
this length does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence dimerization,
whereas
to IL-8
monomers within the dimer weakens monomers association
(Supplementary data, Figure S6). This effect is due to a direct
electrostatic repulsion between the two highly charged GAGs
and to the reorientation upon binding of the charged residues
the C-terminal α-helix (R65, E59, K60, K63, R64 and
at
E66) and is more pronounced for the longer GAGs. As a
result, either one of the GAGs could dissociate from the IL-8
dimer or the IL-8 dimer could dissociate into two monomers,
each binding a GAG. Therefore, GAG binding could regulate
IL-8 monomers, and GAG’s
association equilibrium for
sulfation degree could be used to attune this regulation.
However, this model of IL-8 dimerization does not consider
possible horseshoe-like binding of a longer GAG, which
could assist the dimerization, whereas each IL-8 monomeric
unit binds a GAG in the pose proposed in this study.

Conclusions
In our work, we used ﬂuorescence and NMR spectroscopy,
docking and MD to study the molecular recognition properties

Interaction of IL-8 and GAGs by NMR and molecular modeling

of IL-8 with a variety of GAGs including HA and CS, their
sulfated derivatives and DS. The combination of these comp-
lementary experimental and theoretical approaches allowed us
to discern a distinct and common binding pose to IL-8 for all
analyzed GAGs, even though being of different length and
containing different sulfation patterns. This observed binding
pose is in agreement with previously proposed binding modes
for heparin on IL-8. Calculated free energy decomposition per
residue and acquired backbone chemical shifts agree on the
impact of individual IL-8 residues for GAG binding. Our
results indicate that
the sulfation pattern determines the
strength of binding. Thus, increase in GAG sulfation in general
improves binding as detected by both experimental and com-
putational methods. In addition, we also observe binding speci-
ﬁcity linked to the sulfate substitution positions in cases of
equal sulfation degree. Our analysis on the elongation of the
analyzed GAGs reveals the tetrasaccharide as the minimal
GAG unit required to achieve speciﬁc binding to IL-8, which
also agrees with experimental observations. We also studied
the energetic inﬂuence of GAG binding in the process of IL-8
monomer association. We observed the same binding pose
described for monomeric IL-8 highly scored and inﬂuencing
energetically IL-8 dimer formation. Interestingly, we found that
the GAG glycosidic linkage conformations do not change sig-
niﬁcantly upon IL-8 binding compared with free GAGs, which
has signiﬁcant implications for simplifying the treatment of
longer GAGs in computational analysis and for the further
development of theoretical and experimental approaches to
study GAG–protein interactions. Our study demonstrates that
the combination of experimental ﬂuorescence and NMR spec-
troscopy with computational modeling and simulation can
become very powerful for deriving structural and molecular
recognition models for complicated systems such as GAGs and
their complexes with proteins. In particular, these approaches
may assist in constraining certain degrees of freedom associ-
ated with glycosidic linkages. This would translate into a
decrease in high computational demands and avoid misleading
interpretation of NMR data, which ultimately may allow hand-
ling of longer GAGs.

Materials. The pTXB1 vector encoding hIL-8 (1–77) was
prepared as described in the literature (David et al. 2003). DS
hexasaccharide was purchased from Iduron Ltd (Paterson

from Hyalose, L.L.C (Oklahoma) and used as supplied.
High molecular weight CS4 from bovine trachea and CS6
from shark cartilage were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Taufkirchen, Germany), 15N-labeled ammonium salts from
Eurisotop (Saarbrücken, Germany) and all other chemicals
from Sigma-Aldrich.

hyaluronate lyase from bovine testes (Schiller et al. 1999).
Under these conditions, the GAG hexasaccharides are obtained

According to the compositional data provided by the sup-
plier, high-molecular CS from bovine trachea is characterized
by a content of the 4-sulfate isomer higher than 65%, whereas
CS from shark cartilage exhibits a 6-sulfate content of (cid:1)90%
(Torchia et al. 1977). As the isomeric composition may vary
between individual preparations,
the contribution of both
isomers was checked by means of 1H NMR analysis sub-
sequent
to complete digestion with chondroitinase ABC.
Evaluation of the resolved N-acetyl resonances of the 4- and
6-sulfate isomers of the unsaturated disaccharide resulted in
85% CS4 (bovine trachea) and (cid:1)90% CS6 (shark cartilage).
Although we did not obtain an isomerically pure product, it is
obvious that signiﬁcant differences in the sulfation sites can
be obtained in dependence on the source of the used CS.

The CS hexasaccharide of interest was (subsequent to TLC
puriﬁcation) characterized by combined positive and negative
ion MALDI-TOF MS. Comparisons with related electrospray
(ESI) MS spectra showed that
there was some loss of
the sulfate residues under MALDI conditions but the mass of
the intact molecules was also in all cases clearly detectable.
We prefer the MALDI analysis due to the simplicity of
performance (Nimptsch et al. 2009).

Protein expression. Escherichia coli
strain ER2566 was
transformed with a pTXB1 vector (New England BioLabs,
Ipswich) including the gene for human IL-8 encoding the
77-amino acid form that was C-terminally linked to an Mxe
intein/chitin-binding domain (David et al. 2003, 2004). A
high-density feed-batch fermentation was carried out, cells
were cultivated in 2 L minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl
(2 g/L), (15NH4)2SO4 (9.84 g/L) and glucose (20 g/L) at 37°
C. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-beta-
D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at an OD600 of 10. Cells
were harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation. The cell
pellet was resuspended in buffer A [20 mM Tris, 30 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 500 mM NaCl, pH
7.8] in the presence of lysozyme (15 µg/mL) over 1 h on ice
and broken by three passages through a French press at 800
bar. Afterwards,
the lysate was treated with 10 µg/mL of
DNase I and 3 mM MgCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. After
centrifugation at 38,000 × g for 50 min,
IL-8 could be
detected mainly in the supernatant. Expression and isolation
of the target protein was monitored using sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and
the Bradford assay.

Protein puriﬁcation and refolding. To isolate IL-8 from the
protein extract, two puriﬁcation steps were applied. In the ﬁrst
step, the IMPACT™ system was used. A column ﬁlled with
chitin beads (New England BioLabs) was equilibrated in
buffer B (20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.8)
containing 1 M urea. Afterwards, the protein was loaded onto
the column. After washing the column with 15 bed volumes
of buffer B containing 1 M urea,
the intein cleavage was
induced by ﬂushing with 3 bed volumes of dithiothreitol
(DTT) (0.1 M) in buffer B. The cleavage proceeded at 4°C
for 60 h on the column. IL-8 (1–77) was then eluted with
buffer B and 3 mL fractions were collected, which were
checked by SDS–PAGE. In the second step, DTT and other
remaining cell proteins were removed by carrying out
ion
exchange chromatography, using a HiTrap SP FF Sepharose
1 mL column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala) with a ﬂow of 1 mL/
min. The elution was performed by a linear gradient of 8.3–
100% 1.5 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 1 mM
EDTA, pH 7.0. Fractions containing pure IL-8 were identiﬁed
by SDS-PAGE. Finally, the protein was dialyzed twice against
buffer B [containing 2.5 mM reduced gluthathione (GSH) and
0.5 mM oxidized gluthathione (GSSG), pH 9.3] and buffer C
3−, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM arginine,
(20 mM PO4
pH 7.0). The folded protein was lyophilized or stored in
aliquots at −80°C. Protein was characterized by SDS–PAGE
and mass spectrometry. The concentration was determined
spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefﬁcient of
7240 M−1 cm−1 and by Bradford assay.

Computational studies
IL-8 and GAG structures. The X-ray structure of monomeric
IL-8 (PDB ID 3IL8, 2.00 Å) was used for docking and MD
simulations. For
for
monomeric and dimeric IL-8, we used this structure for
building the dimeric IL-8 by superimposing it to each of the
IL-8 subunits in the NMR IL-8 dimer structure (PDB ID
1IL8). The RMSD between the X-ray and the NMR structures
is 1.57 Å for backbone atoms. The GAG structures were
modeled based on the structures available in the PDB for
octasaccharides of HA (PDB ID: 2BVK, NMR), hexameric
CS4 (PDB ID: 1CS4, ﬁber diffraction) tetrasaccharides of DS
(PDB ID: 1HM2, X-ray 2.00 Å), dodecasaccharide of heparin
with iduronic acid in C1
4 ring conformation (PDB ID: 1HPN,
NMR. Their geometries were optimized with the AMBER99
force ﬁeld implemented in MOE (Chemical Computing
Group, Inc., Montreal, CA). Fourteen HA and CS derivatives
were used in our docking and MD calculations (Table II).

Docking. Docking was performed with and without explicit
water molecules in the binding site. Autodock3 (Morris et al.
1998) was used (150 runs) with the genetic algorithm and
default parameters. A grid box, large enough to avoid biases
of the docking results to a certain ligand orientation, was
centered on the previously described heparin-binding site
(H23, K25, R65, K69, K72 and R73; Kuschert et al. 1998).
All torsion angles of the tetrameric ligands were left ﬂexible.
Hexasaccharides were optimized with the AMBER99 force
ﬁeld, and then rigidly docked. Obtained binding poses were
clustered by RMSD (4 Å for heavy atoms). Docking poses for
different ligands were considered similar by visual inspection
when their orientations and placements were the same relative
to the IL-8 contacting residues.

Molecular dynamics. MD simulations in a periodic box of
TIP3P waters were performed as described previously
(Samsonov et
al. 2008). The AMBER 10.0 package
(Case et al. 2008) was used with ff03 parameters (Duan et al.
2003) for protein and the GLYCAM06 for GAGs. Sulfate
charges for HA and CS derivatives libraries were obtained
from literature (Huige and Altona 1995). The scaling
parameters SCEE and SCNB were set to 1 as required for the
use of the GLYCAM06 force ﬁeld within AMBER (Kirschner
et al. 2008). Harmonic constraints (10 kcal/mol Å) for IL-8
backbone atoms were applied to retain the secondary
structure, as it has been observed that the C-terminal α-helix,

occur because of the force ﬁeld instability for this small fold
[similar challenge has been previously discussed (Kadirvelraj
et al. 2008)]. To simulate longer GAGs, we elongated the
docked structures to 8-, 10- and 12-mers by adding a
monosaccharide residue stepwise to the GAGs-termini and
minimized them using the AMBER99 force ﬁeld in MOE.

linkage 2 (Glc/GalNAc–GlcUA)

conformations were analyzed in terms of the dihedral angles
φ and ψ. Glycosidic linkage 1 (GlcUA–Glc/GalNAc) and
are deﬁned
glycosidic
as
(H1-C1-O3-C3) and
(C1-O3-C3-H3), and (H1-C1-O4-C4) and (C1-O4-C4-H4),
respectively. The obtained results for all glycosidic linkages
of
the same type within the same molecule were taken
together to create the Ramachandran-like plots. The structures
of bound GAGs from the PDB were compared with the data
on glycosidic linkages in MD simulations of free GAGs. To
compare conformations of the modeled GAGs bound to IL-8
and free GAGs, MD frames were extracted each 200 ps and
plotted together with the Ramachandran-like plot obtained for
free GAGs.

MM-PBSA free energy calculations. Energetic post-processing
of the trajectories and per residue energy decomposition were
done in a continuous solvent model using MM-PBSA and
MM-GBSA of AMBER 10. The statistically representative
snapshots were chosen as described by Lafont et al. (2007).

Data analysis and its graphical representation were carried

out with the R-package (R Development Core Team 2006).
