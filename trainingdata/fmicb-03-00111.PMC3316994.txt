Ebolavirus (EBOV) is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA virus, which
consists of ﬁve species: Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, Bundibu-
gyo ebolavirus, and Reston ebolavirus. EBOV causes a lethal hemorrhagic fever in both
humans and non-human primates. The EBOV RNA genome encodes seven viral proteins:
NP, VP35, VP40, GP, VP30, VP24, and L. VP40 is a matrix protein and is essential for
virus assembly and release from host cells. Expression of VP40 in mammalian cells is
sufﬁcient to generate extracellular virus-like particles, which resemble authentic virions.
Tetherin/BST-2, which was identiﬁed as an effective cellular factor that prevents human
immunodeﬁciency virus-1 release in the absence of viral accessory protein Vpu, has been
reported to inhibit ZEBOV VP40-induced VLP release.Tetherin/BST-2 appears to inhibit virus
release by physically tethering viral particles to the cell surface via its N-terminal transmem-
brane domain and C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Replication of ZEBOV is
not inhibited by tetherin/BST-2 expression, although tetherin/BST-2 was expected to inhibit
EBOV release as well as VLP release. Recently, it was reported that viral glycoprotein of
EBOV, GP, antagonizes the antiviral effect of tetherin/BST-2. However, the mechanism by
which GP antagonizes the antiviral activity of tetherin/BST-2 and whether GP of the other
EBOV species function as antagonists of tetherin/BST-2 remain unclear.

INTRODUCTION
Ebolavirus (EBOV) is a member of the family Filoviridae in the
order Mononegavirales (MNV), and causes a lethal hemorrhagic
fever in both humans and non-human primates (Peters, 2005).
Five species of EBOV have been deﬁned to date on the basis of
genetic divergence: Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus
(SEBOV), Tai Forest ebolavirus (TFEBOV), Reston ebolavirus
(REBOV), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV). ZEBOV, SEBOV,
TFEBOV, and BEBOV cause clinical symptoms in humans and
non-human primates, while REBOV causes disease only in non-
human primates, and not in humans. At present, there are
no licensed vaccines or effective therapies for EBOV infection.
Recently, tetherin/BST-2 was identiﬁed as a cellular factor that
inhibits the release of a wide variety of enveloped viruses, including
retroviruses, herpesviruses, and Lassa virus, and the production of
virus-like particles (VLPs) of ﬁloviruses and Nipa virus (Jouvenet
et al., 2009; Kaletsky et al., 2009; Sakuma et al., 2009a; Radoshitzky
et al., 2010). Tetherin/BST-2 may function as a host innate antivi-
ral system against a wide variety of viruses, as tetherin/BST-2 is
broadly induced by treatment with type I interferons (IFNs) in
various cell types (Ishikawa et al., 1995; Blasius et al., 2006). This
review will focus on EBOV replication and antiviral function of
tetherin/BST-2.

EBOLAVIRUS AND ITS REPLICATION
Electron microscopic studies have indicated that EBOV is mor-
phologically pleomorphic, with U-shaped, ﬁgure 6-shaped, or
circular conﬁgurations, or as elongated ﬁlamentous forms of vary-
ing length (up to 14000 nm). The virions are usually 80 nm in

diameter and 800–1000 nm in length and enveloped with a lipid
bilayer (envelope) that is derived from the host cell, anchoring a
glycoprotein that projects spikes 7–10 nm in length from its surface
(Sanchez et al., 2007).

The genome is approximately 19 kb in length and encodes
the viral proteins in the order NP–VP35–VP40–GP/sGP–VP30–
(cid:2)
VP24–L (Figure 1). The extragenic sequence at the 3
end, which
is called the leader, of EBOV is short, ranging from 50 to 70 bases
in length, while the length of the 5
end sequence, which is called
the trailer, varies between species, ranging from 25 to 677 bases
(cid:2)
(25 bases for REBOV and 677 bases for ZEBOV). The extreme 3
and 5
end sequences are conserved and potentially form stem-
loop structures (Geisbert and Jahrling, 1995; Sanchez et al., 2007).
These sequences contain the encapsidation signals as well as the
replication origin and transcription promoter.

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

The NP and VP30 proteins are the major and minor viral nucle-
oproteins, respectively, which are phosphorylated, and interact
strongly with the genomic RNA molecule to form the viral nucle-
ocapsid along with VP35 and L (Mühlberger et al., 1999). The
L and VP35 proteins form the viral polymerase complex, which
transcribes and replicates the viral genome. The L protein has the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the complex, and
possesses motifs linked to RNA binding, phosphodiester bonding,
and ribonucleotide triphosphate binding. VP35 is thought to play
an essential role as a cofactor that affects the mode of viral tran-
scription and replication. VP35 also functions as an antagonist
against the type I IFN signaling pathway (Basler et al., 2000).

The GP gene contains a translational stop codon in the mid-
dle, thus preventing synthesis of full-length glycoprotein. Twenty

percent of the mRNA was shown to be edited, containing one addi-
tional non-template A in a stretch of seven consecutive A residues.
The edited mRNA species encode full-length GP, whereas the pri-
mary gene product is a smaller secreted glycoprotein (sGP), which
is produced in large amounts. The GP precursor (preGP), is syn-
thesized as type I membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). preGP is cleaved by the cellular proprotein convertase furin
into the N-terminal fragment GP1 and the C-terminal fragment
GP2 which are linked by a disulﬁde bond forming the GP1, 2 com-
plex in the trans-Golgi network (TGN; Volchkov et al., 1998). GP1
and GP2 function as a surface protein and a transmembrane pro-
tein, respectively. The trimeric spike of GP1, 2 is the only envelope
glycoprotein of the virion and is assumed to be responsible for
binding to cellular receptors and for fusion of the envelope with
the cellular membrane in the course of viral entry into the host
cell. GP has marked effects on viral pathogenesis and antigenic-
ity. Recent report suggested that sGP can substitute for GP1 and
present on virion as a structural protein, although sGP had been
considered as a non-structural protein (Iwasa et al., 2011). The
function of sGP is still unknown. sGP may contribute to disease
progression, as it has been reported that large amounts of sGP are
present in the blood of acutely infected patients (Volchkov et al.,
1995; Sanchez et al., 1996).

The VP40 and VP24 proteins are viral matrix proteins and are
associated with the virion envelope. VP40 is the most abundant
protein in the virion and plays a key role in virus assembly and bud-
ding as viral matrix protein. Expression of VP40 in mammalian
cells is sufﬁcient to generate extracellular VLPs, which resemble
authentic virions (Harty et al., 2000; Yasuda et al., 2003). Only
small amounts of VP24 are present in the virion. VP24 has been
reported to function as an antagonist of the type I IFN signaling
pathway, along with VP35 (Reid et al., 2006).

TETHERIN/BST-2
Tetherin/BST-2 (also known as CD317 or HM1.24) has been
identiﬁed as an effective cellular factor that prevents human
immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV)-1 release in the absence of the
viral accessory protein Vpu (Neil et al., 2008; Van Damme et al.,
2008). Tetherin/BST-2 consists of four domains, i.e., an N-terminal
cytoplasmic tail (CT), a single transmembrane domain, an extra-
cellular domain, and a putative C-terminal glycosylphosphatidyli-
nositol (GPI) anchor, and therefore both ends of this molecule are
associated with the plasma membrane (Figure 2A). This mole-
cule is localized to lipid rafts at the cell surface and membranes of
the TGN and recycling compartments (Kupzig et al., 2003; Blasius
et al., 2006; Rollason et al., 2007; Evans et al., 2010). In addition,
tetherin/BST-2 has two putative N-linked glycosylation sites in
the extracellular domain and forms a homodimer by intermole-
cular disulﬁde bonds (Ohtomo et al., 1999; Kupzig et al., 2003;
Figure 2A).

FIGURE 2 | Structure and antiviral action of Tetherin/BST-2.
(A) Structural representation of tetherin/BST-2. Tetherin/BST-2 has two
putative N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain and forms a
homodimer by intermolecular disulﬁde bonds. Both ends of tetherin/BST-2
are associated with the plasma membrane via the N-terminal
transmembrane domain and C-terminal GPI anchor. (B) Proposed model for
the antiviral mechanism of tetherin/BST-2. Tetherin/BST-2 appears to inhibit
the release of progeny viruses by directly tethering virions to cells, brieﬂy
by anchoring one end of the molecule on the cell membrane and the other
end on the viral envelope. Progeny virions could be also directly tethered to
each other by tetherin/BST-2.

Previous studies showed that tetherin/BST-2 is constitutively
expressed in terminally differentiated B cells, bone marrow stromal
cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and is also broadly induced
by treatment with type I IFN in various cell types (Ishikawa
et al., 1995; Blasius et al., 2006). In fact, the upstream region of
tetherin/BST-2 contains a tandem repeat of IL-6 response ele-
ments, STAT3 binding site, and the IFN response elements IRF-1/2
and ISGF3 (Ohtomo et al., 1999). Therefore, tetherin/BST-2 may
be involved in antiviral host defense as a mechanism of innate
immunity. However, the physiological function of tetherin/BST-2
is not yet clear.

Recent analysis for in vivo expression of tetherin/BST-2 showed
that tetherin/BST-2 was expressed to varying degrees in most
organs and a number of specialized cell types, including hepato-
cytes, pneumocytes, ducts of major salivary glands, pancreas and
kidney, Paneth cells, epithelia, Leydig cells, plasma cells, bone mar-
row stromal cells, monocytes, and vascular endothelium, without
IFN stimulation (Erikson et al., 2011). Therefore, IFN may only
partially regulate tetherin/BST-2 in vivo.

ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITIES OF TETHERIN/BST-2
We have shown that tetherin/BST-2 also efﬁciently inhibits the
egress of VLPs of Marburgvirus and Lassa virus and retains
VLPs on the cell surface (Sakuma et al., 2009a). Furthermore,
tetherin/BST-2 has also been reported to inhibit the release of

retroviruses other than HIV-1, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated her-
pesvirus (KSHV), and the production of VLPs of EBOV and Nipa
virus (Jouvenet et al., 2009; Kaletsky et al., 2009; Mansouri et al.,
2009; Radoshitzky et al., 2010).

The N-linked glycosylation of tetherin/BST-2 is dispensable
for the antiviral activity, while both N-terminal transmembrane
domain and C-terminal GPI anchor are required for the activity
(Neil et al., 2008; Andrew et al., 2009; Sakuma et al., 2009a). Inter-
estingly, tetherin/BST-2 mutant with complete loss of dimeriza-
tion activity (the cysteine mutant) still showed apparent inhibitory
activity for the production of Lassa and Marburg VLPs, although
its activity was reduced (Sakuma et al., 2009b). For HIV-1, the
cysteine mutant showed much weaker antiviral activity (Andrew
et al., 2009; Perez-Caballero et al., 2009). Nevertheless, these obser-
vations suggested that dimerization of tetherin/BST-2 is important
but not essential for its antiviral activity. A recent study showed
that tetherin/BST-2 inhibits HIV-1 release by directly tethering
virions to cells, brieﬂy by anchoring one end of the molecule on
the cell membrane and the other end on the viral envelope (Perez-
Caballero et al., 2009; Figure 2B). Progeny virions released from
cells could also be directly tethered to each other by tetherin/BST-
2. It is likely that tethering of virion by tetherin dimer is stronger
than that by tetherin monomer because of stronger association
with the membrane. Therefore, tetherin/BST-2 appears to inhibit
release of a wide variety of enveloped viruses from host cells by a
similar mechanism.

COUNTERACTION OF TETHERIN/BST-2 ANTIVIRAL ACTION
BY GP
Human immunodeﬁciency virus-1 Vpu is known to antago-
nize the antiviral function of tetherin/BST-2 (Neil et al., 2008;
Van Damme et al., 2008). Moreover, recent studies have shown
that HIV-2 and simian immunodeﬁciency virus (SIV) Env, SIV
Nef, KSHV K5, and EBOV GP also function as antagonists of
tetherin/BST-2, suggesting that tetherin/BST-2 plays an impor-
tant role in host defense against viral infection and these viruses
have evolutionarily acquired viral-encoded antagonists to counter-
act the antiviral function of tetherin/BST-2 (Gupta et al., 2009b;
Jia et al., 2009; Kaletsky et al., 2009; Le Tortorec and Neil, 2009;
Mansouri et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009).

Kaletsky et al. (2009) demonstrated that EBOV GP interacts
directly with tetherin/BST-2 and abrogates the inhibition of VP40-
induced VLP release by tetherin/BST-2. In addition, analysis using
infectious virus showed that the expression of tetherin/BST-2 had
no effect on ZEBOV replication and spread (Radoshitzky et al.,
2010).

One of the major functions of HIV-1 Vpu for counteraction
of antiviral action of tetherin/BST-2 is downregulation of the sur-
face expression of tetherin/BST-2. Several studies demonstrated
that Vpu directs the degradation of human BST-2 via a β-TrCP-
dependent mechanism. Vpu acts as an adapter molecule linking
tetherin/BST-2 to the β-TrCP/SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to
induce the trafﬁcking to late endosomes, lysosomes, and protea-
somes, and subsequent lysosomal and/or proteasomal degradation
of tetherin/BST-2. Vpu is thought to remove tetherin/BST-2 from
the cell surface by these pathways (Douglas et al., 2009; Mitchell
et al., 2009). Recent report suggests that β-TrCP-independent

mechanism is also involved in the downregulation of cell sur-
face expression of tetherin/BST-2 by Vpu, since mutations in the
β-TrCP-binding motif of Vpu did not completely abrogate its
antagonism of tetherin/BST-2. Schmidt et al. (2011) have reported
that Vpu inhibited both the anterograde transport of newly syn-
thesized tetherin/BST-2 and the recycling of tetherin/BST-2 to
the cell surface and trapped trafﬁcking tetherin/BST-2 molecules
at the TGN. Vpu interacts with tetherin/BST-2 through species-
speciﬁc determinants in their respective transmembrane domains
(Gupta et al., 2009a; McNatt et al., 2009). HIV-1 Vpu speciﬁcally
antagonizes the tetherin/BST-2s from human, chimpanzee, and
gorilla, which are susceptible to HIV-1 infection, but not those
from African green monkey, rhesus macaque, and mouse, which
are not susceptible to this virus (McNatt et al., 2009; Kühl et al.,
2011).

In contrast, Ebola GP counteracted tetherin/BST-2 from dif-
ferent primate species, including rhesus macaque and African
green monkey (Kühl et al., 2011). Ebola GP does not seem to
require a speciﬁc tetherin/BST-2 sequence for its activity (Lopez
et al., 2010). It has been reported that tetherin/BST-2 interacts
with the GP2 subunit of EBOV GP, although the antogonism of
tetherin/BST-2 function by GP2 have not examined (Kühl et al.,
2011). Vpu reduces cell surface expression of tetherin/BST-2, while
Ebola GP appears to counteract tetherin/BST-2 without remov-
ing it from the cell surface, suggesting that both proteins employ
different mechanisms to counteract tetherin/BST-2 (Lopez et al.,
2010; Kühl et al., 2011). Ebola GP and tetherin/BST-2 colocalize
in intracellular compartment, but not on the plasma membrane
(Kühl et al., 2011). The sequestration of tetherin/BST-2 in the
speciﬁc intracellular compartment may be one of the mecha-
nisms of antagonism by Ebola GP. So far, the mechanism by
which EBOV GP antagonizes tetherin/BST-2 remains unclear.
Further investigations are required to understand the mecha-
nism by which EBOV GP counteracts the antiviral function of
tetherin/BST-2.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Tetherin/BST-2 inhibits the production of a wide variety of
enveloped viruses. On the other hand, several viruses have
evolved viral-encoded antagonists to counteract antiviral action
of tetherin/BST-2. EBOV also appears to have evolved GP as an
antagonist of tetherin/BST-2. However, it has been reported that
high-level expression of tetherin/BST-2 inhibits ZEBOV produc-
tion even in the presence of GP (Kühl et al., 2011). Furthermore,
it may be possible to identify tetherin/BST-2 mutants that are not
counteracted by EBOV GP.

Therefore, regulation of the progeny EBOV release may be pos-
sible by in vivo induction or exogenous expression of tetherin/BST-
2. Tetherin/BST-2 has great potential for the development of novel
antiviral therapeutic strategies against EBOV infection.
