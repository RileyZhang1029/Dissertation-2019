Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of adult T cell leukemia
(ATL) and HTLV-1 – associated myelopathy and tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).
HTLV-1 has a preferential tropism for CD4T cells in healthy carriers and ATL patients, while
both CD4 and CD8 T cells serve as viral reservoirs in HAM/TSP patients. HTLV-1 has also
been detected other cell types, including monocytes, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells.
In contrast to the limited cell tropism of HTLV-1 in vivo, the HTLV receptor appears to be
expressed in almost all human or animal cell lines. It remains to be examined whether
this cell tropism is determined by host factors or by HTLV-1 heterogeneity. Unlike most
retroviruses, cell-free virions of HTLV-1 are very poorly infectious. The lack of completely
HTLV-1-resistant cells and the low infectivity of HTLV-1 have hampered research on the HTLV
entry receptor. Entry of HTLV-1 into target cells is thought to involve interactions between
the env (Env) glycoproteins, a surface glycoprotein (surface unit), and a transmembrane
glycoprotein. Recent studies have shown that glucose transporter GLUT1, heparan sulfate
proteoglycans (HSPGs), and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) are the three proteins important for the
entry of HTLV-1. Studies using adherent cell lines have shown that GLUT1 can function as
a receptor for HTLV. HSPGs are required for efﬁcient entry of HTLV-1 into primary CD4 T
cells. NRP-1 is expressed in most established cell lines. Further studies have shown that
these three molecules work together to promote HTLV-1 binding to cells and fusion of viral
and cell membranes. The virus could ﬁrst contact with HSPGs and then form complexes
with NRP-1, followed by association with GLUT1. It remains to be determined whether
these three molecules can explain HTLV-1 cell tropism. It also remains to be more deﬁn-
itively proven that these molecules are sufﬁcient to permit HTLV-1 entry into completely
HTLV-1-resistant cells.

INTRODUCTION
Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) or T-lymphotrophic
virus type 1 is a member of the deltaretrovirus family, which
includes the simian T-lymphotrophic virus type 1 (STLV-1) and
bovine leukemia virus (BLV). There are four known strains of
HTLV, i.e., HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HTLV-3, and HTLV-4. HTLV-1 and
HTLV-2 are prevalent worldwide (Edlich et al., 2000; Proietti et al.,
2005), while HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 have been identiﬁed only in
Central Africa (Mahieux and Gessain, 2009). HTLV-1 and STLV-
1 are highly related; HTLV-2 and HTLV-3 are closely related to
STLV-2 and STLV-3, respectively. Thus, the HTLVs are thought
to derive from interspecies transmission between monkeys and
humans. The genetic variation among HTLV-1 strains is less than
8%, and HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 show 70% nucleotide homology
(Gessain et al., 1996; Feuer and Green, 2005).

Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 was ﬁrst isolated in 1980 in
a T cell line derived from a patient with cutaneous T cell lymphoma
(Poiesz et al., 1980) and was shown to be the etiological agent of
adult T cell leukemia (ATL; Hinuma et al., 1981; Yoshida et al.,
1982; Takatsuki, 2005). In 1985, HTLV-1-seropositive patients in
French Martinique were diagnosed with a neurodegenerative dis-
order, termed tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP; Gessain et al.,

1985). A similar clinical disorder was reported in Japanese patients
and was named HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (HAM; Osame
et al., 1986; Osame and Igata, 1989). HTLV-2 is rarely pathogenic
and is sporadically associated with neurological disorders (Hjelle
et al., 1992; Araujo and Hall, 2004). There have been no known
diseases associated with HTLV-3 or HTLV-4.

Here, the results from in vivo and in vitro studies concerning
HTLV-1 infection, focusing on the mechanisms of HTLV-1 entry,
are reviewed.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HTLV-1 INFECTION
An estimated 15–20 million persons are infected with HTLV-1
throughout the world. The virus is endemic in southwestern Japan,
Central Africa, the Caribbean Islands, and Australia (aborigines) as
well as in some regions of South America, Melanesia, Middle East,
and India. Thus, HTLV-1 prevalence shows a quite strange ethnic
distribution. In these endemic areas, the seroprevalence rates range
from 0.1 to 30% (Blattner et al., 1982; Saxinger et al., 1984; Yanag-
ihara et al., 1990; Gotuzzo et al., 2000; Sonoda et al., 2011). After
prolonged latency periods of 40–60 years, approximately 5% of
HTLV-1-infected individuals (6.6% of males and 2.1% of females)
will develop ATL (Kajiyama et al., 1986; Murphy et al., 1989; Edlich

et al., 2000; Proietti et al., 2005; Sonoda et al., 2011). HTLV-2 is
prevalent among intravenous drug users (IDUs) and is endemic
among IDUs in the USA, Europe, South America, and Southeast
Asia (Lee et al., 1989; Khabbaz et al., 1992; Fukushima et al., 1995).
Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 is transmitted through
three major routes: (1) breastfeeding from mother-to-child, (2)
sexual contact from male to female, and (3) needle sharing which
mediates exposure to contaminated blood. Mother-to-child trans-
mission through breastfeeding is the predominant mode. Trans-
mission rates are approximately 20% for children born to infected
mothers. Lifetime sexual transmission rates between spouses are
60% from infected males to females and only 0.4% from infected
females to males (Kajiyama et al., 1986; Kusuhara et al., 1987;
Murphy et al., 1989; Hino et al., 1994; Ureta-Vidal et al., 1999; Son-
oda et al., 2011). These epidemiological characteristics of HTLV-1
infection are, or shall be, associated with virological properties of
HTLV-1 that have been, or will be, clariﬁed in vitro.

STRUCTURE AND GENE PRODUCTS OF HTLV-1 GENOME
Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 is an enveloped virus of
approximately 100 nm in diameter. Newly synthesized viral parti-
cles attach to target cell receptors on the viral envelope (Env) and
enter the target cell through membrane fusion. Entry is followed
by capsid uncoating and content release into the cell cytoplasm.
The viral RNA is reverse transcribed into double-stranded DNA
by reverse transcriptase (RT), which is then transported to the
nucleus and integrated into the host chromosome, forming the
provirus.

Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 is a single-stranded diploid
RNA virus, and the proviral genome of HTLV-1 is 9,030–9,040
nucleotides long containing two ﬂanking long terminal repeat
(LTR) sequences (Figure 1; Seiki et al., 1983). The LTRs of HTLV-1
(cid:2)
comprise three components: a unique 3
(U3) region, a repeated
(cid:2)
(R) region, and a unique 5
(U5) region. The HTLV-1 genome is
packaged in the viral core with the viral nucleocapsid protein (p15
NC), which is surrounded by capsid (p24 CA) and matrix (p19
MA) proteins.

The HTLV-1 genome encodes the structural proteins Gag (NC,
CA, and MA) and Env and the enzymes RT, RNase H (RH), inte-
grase (IN), and protease (Pro; Figure 1). The env gene encodes

the surface unit (SU) gp46 and transmembrane unit (TM) gp21
proteins (Hattori et al., 1984; Figure 2).

The envelope is made of a lipid bilayer of cellular origin, which
contains the virally encoded Env glycoproteins. The Env proteins
are synthesized as a precursor protein, gp62, and cleaved into the
gp46 and gp21 glycoprotein subunits. The SU protein gp46 is asso-
ciated with the TM gp21, and the SU-TM complex is anchored
to the viral or infected cell membrane through the membrane-
spanning region (MSR) within TM (Figures 3 and 4). HTLV-1 Env
is a trimer of the gp46-gp21 subunit pair. Cell receptor-binding
activity is conferred by gp46 and the fusion activity is a function
of gp21. The HTLV-1 Env proteins are genetically highly con-
served among isolates, and the variability within their amino acid
sequences ranges from 1 to 8% (Gessain et al., 1996; Feuer and
Green, 2005).

The pX region encodes the accessory proteins as well as the
regulatory proteins Tax and Rex (Sodroski et al., 1984; Cann et al.,
1985; Felber et al., 1985; Fujisawa et al., 1985; Figure 1). The acces-
sory genes are alternatively spliced and translated from different
initiation sites. These genes encode novel proteins, such as p12/p8,
p30, and p13 (Albrecht et al., 2000; Silverman et al., 2004; Nicot
et al., 2005). The anti-sense region corresponding to the pX region
and the env gene region encodes HBZ (Gaudray et al., 2002; Arnold
et al., 2006; Matsuoka and Jeang, 2011; Figure 1). The expression
of the HBZ gene has been detected in primary leukemic cells iso-
lated from all ATL patients tested while the tax transcript was
hardly detectable in them. The HBZ gene has growth-promoting
activity in vivo and in vitro. These ﬁndings suggest that HBZ gene
transcription is indispensable for the development of ATL.

CELLS INFECTED WITH HTLV-1 IN VIVO
Approximately up to 5% of HTLV-1-infected patients will develop
ATL after a prolonged latency period (Uchiyama, 1997; Takat-
suki, 2005; Sonoda et al., 2011). In vivo, the targets of virus-
induced transformation are CD4+/CD45RO+ memory T cells.
A monoclonal population of T cells showing CD3+/CD4+/CD8-
/CD25+/HLA-DR+/CCR4+ cell surface markers also character-
izes malignant cells of ATL (Uchiyama, 1997; Suzuki et al., 1998;
Takatsuki, 2005; Hieshima et al., 2008). Regulatory T cells (Tregs)

HTLV-1 infection in vivo and in vitro

might also be infected in some patients (Chen et al., 2006; Yano
et al., 2007; Abe et al., 2008; Toulza et al., 2009).

Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 – associated myelopa-
thy and tropical spastic paraparesis primarily affects the thoracic
spinal cord, and patients often show limb paraparesis (Osame et al.,
1986; Osame and Igata, 1989). In the brains of some HAM/TSP
patients, astrocytes are productively infected with HTLV-1. Several
lines of evidence, such as IgG deposits in CNS parenchyma, indi-
cate that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted in HAM/TSP
patients (Walter et al., 1994; Lehky et al., 1995). In addition, the
infection of adherent cells in vivo has been reported: sweat gland
epithelia, salivary glands, vascular endothelial cells, and mammary
glands (Setoyama et al., 1998).
In infected individuals, HTLV-1 is primarily found in CD4+
T cells, while HTLV-2 has frequently been found in CD8+ T cells
(Richardson et al., 1990; Ijichi et al., 1992). Although CD4+ T cells
are the major reservoir, other hematopoietic cells [CD8+ T cells,
B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs),
and megakaryocytes], synovial cells, and glial cells (astrocytes
and microglial cells) have been infected with HTLV-1 (Kitajima
et al., 1991; Koyanagi et al., 1993; Walter et al., 1994; Lehky et al.,
1995; Hanon et al., 2000a; Nagai et al., 2001). It is intriguing
that HTLV-I-speciﬁc, but not Epstein–Barr virus-speciﬁc, CD8+ T
lymphocytes were shown to be preferentially infected with HTLV-
1 (Wucherpfennig et al., 1992; Goon et al., 2002). The ratio of
HTLV-1 genome-positive cells in some HAM/TSP patients was
reported to be as high as 40–65% in the CD4+ and CD8+ subset.
The proportion of cells expressing HTLV-1 RNA is 0.02–0.1% in
both subsets. Other reports also show the expression of the HTLV-
1 genome in vivo (Cho et al., 1995; Hanon et al., 2000b), although
HTLV-1 RNA expression in vivo is known to be highly suppressed
in HTLV-1 carriers and ATL patients.

Experiments using deuterated glucose labeling to quantify
in vivo lymphocyte dynamics in HTLV-1-infected individuals
revealed that CD4+/CD45RO+ and CD8+/CD45RO+ T lym-
phocyte proliferation was elevated in HTLV-1-infected subjects;
about 1012 more lymphocytes were estimated to be produced
per year in HTLV-1-infected subjects compared with HTLV-I-
uninfected subjects (Asquith et al., 2007). This high cell turnover
was correlated with Tax expression measured ex vivo. These ﬁnd-
ings suggest that HTLV-1 genes may be expressed somewhere
in vivo. These virological, pathological, and clinical features of
HTLV-1 infection can or will be explained by the cell tropism and
pathogenicity of HTLV-1.

ANIMAL MODELS OF HTLV-1 INFECTION
Animal models of HTLV-1 infection and transmission have clari-
ﬁed the effects of neutralizing antibodies and viral and host factors
on persistent HTLV-1 infections. Some non-human primates, rab-
bits, rats, and mice, can be infected with HTLV-1 (Lairmore et al.,
2005). In these models, HTLV-1 is also detected in various types
of hematopoietic cells and non-hematopoietic tissues, including
the brain, lung, kidney, heart, liver, and thyroid.

Milk transmission of HTLV-1 in rabbits can be inhibited
through passive immunizations using neutralizing antibodies or
HTLV-1 Env vaccines (Akagi et al., 1985; Nakamura et al., 1987;
Uemura et al., 1987; Kataoka et al., 1990; Sawada et al., 1991).

Although there is a strong immune response to HTLV proteins,
such Env or Tax, through the humoral or cellular immune sys-
tem in humans, HTLV-1 can sustain life-long persistence in sub-
jects and HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes can robustly proliferate as
described above.

The HTLV-1 accessory proteins, p12/p8, p30, and p13, have
been implicated in the transmission and spread of HTLV-1 in vivo
or in HTLV-1 persistence in animal models, although these pro-
teins were shown to have little effect on HTLV-1 infection in vitro
(Albrecht et al., 2000; Silverman et al., 2004; Nicot et al., 2005;
Lairmore et al., 2011). The viral protein p12 localizes in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), binds major histocompatibility com-
plex (MHC) class I in the ER, decreases surface expression of
MHC-I, ICAM-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM-
2), and inhibits the killing of HTLV-1-infected cells by natural
killer cells. p8, Proteolytically cleaved from p12, increases T cell
contact through LFA-1 clustering and augments the number and
length of cellular conduits among T cells. p8 or even virions are
transferred to neighboring T cells through these conduits (van
Prooyen et al., 2010). The p30 protein will localize in the nucleus
and retain the Tax/Rex messenger inside the nucleus and enhances
cell survival by altering cell cycle regulation. p13 Localizes in
the nucleus and mitochondria. p13 can modulate cell survival
and have an pivotal role in early virus transmission and virus
persistence in vivo.

INFECTION OF CELLS WITH HTLV-1 IN VITRO
Unlike most other viruses, cell-free HTLV-1 is poorly infec-
tious, and efﬁcient infection requires cell-to-cell contact (Clapham
et al., 1983; Hoshino et al., 1983; Nagy et al., 1983; Fan et al.,
1992; Mazurov et al., 2010). HTLV-1-infected cells produce small
amounts and low titers of the virus. However, HTLV-1 has passed
on from generation to generation among humans for a long time.
Adherent cells persistently infected with HTLV-1 have rarely
been isolated (Hoshino et al., 1983; Ho et al., 1984; Hoxie et al.,
1984; Yoshikura et al., 1984; Fan et al., 1992; Mazurov et al., 2010).
However, the HTLV receptor has been detected in almost all ver-
tebrate cells (Sutton and Littman, 1996; Trejo and Ratner, 2000;
Manel et al., 2005a) in contrast to the limited cell tropism in vivo.
Some cell lines will form numerous syncytia upon co-cultivation
with HTLV-1-producing cells, while others are resistant to syncytia
formation (Jassal et al., 2001).

Surface unit-Fc fusion proteins consisting of the Fc portion of
immunoglobulin and HTLV-1 SU [either full-length gp46 or the
N-terminal Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of SU; Figure 3]
have been used to detect and analyze HTLV-1 receptors. The SU-
Fc binds to almost all vertebrate cell lines and can often bind
to cell lines considered to be negative for the receptor due to
their resistance to Env-mediated syncytia formation (Sutton and
Littman, 1996; Trejo and Ratner, 2000; Jassal et al., 2001; Manel
et al., 2005a). The use of SU-Fc has, however, clariﬁed that HTLV-1
receptors are lacking on the surface of resting or naive CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells but HTLV-1 receptors can be rapidly upregulated by
treating them with PHA/IL-2, TGF-β, or interleukin-7 (Moriuchi
and Moriuchi, 2002; Manel et al., 2003a; Nath et al., 2003; Jones
et al., 2005a). These properties have been used to characterize an
HTLV-1 receptor candidate as described below.

HTLV-1 infection in vivo and in vitro

VIRAL SYNAPSE AND BIOFILM-LIKE STRUCTURE IN HTLV-1
INFECTION
Special structures permitting efﬁcient transmission of HTLV-1
have been identiﬁed. Namely, viral or virological synapses (VS),
similar to immune or immunological synapses, can be made after
cell-to-cell contacts between HTLV-1-infected and uninfected T
cells (Igakura et al., 2003; Jenkins et al., 2009). Lymphocyte contact
will rapidly induce polarization of the cytoskeleton, especially the
microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), of HTLV-1-infected cells
at the cell–cell junction: HTLV-I genome and Gag proteins accu-
mulate at the junction. Subsequently, polarization is promoted by
Tax, and the formation of VS leads to the entry of viral parti-
cles, viral proteins, and genomic RNA into uninfected target cells
(Igakura et al., 2003; Nejmeddine et al., 2005; Jenkins et al., 2009).
VS also lead to the efﬁcient transmission of human immunode-
ﬁciency virus type 1 (HIV-1): its transmission takes place even
in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. The viral envelope
protein is required for the transmission of HTLV-1, suggesting
that complete HTLV-1 virions are transferred across the synapse
(Nejmeddine et al., 2009). Electron tomography combined with
the immunostaining of viral proteins has demonstrated the pres-
ence of enveloped HTLV-1 particles in the VS formed between
naturally infected lymphocytes and uninfected cells (Majorovits
et al., 2008).

More recently it was shown that HTLV-1 virions are stored out-
side the cells within a protective microenvironment: speciﬁc com-
ponents of the extracellular matrix, including collagen, galectin-3,
and tetherin, form a bioﬁlm-like structure on the outer surface of
infected cells (Pais-Correia et al., 2009). Following contact with T
cells, these structures are rapidly transferred from infected lym-
phocytes to uninfected cells, resulting in the infection of target
cells. HTLV-1 p8 promotes the formation of cellular conduits
between T cells as described above (van Prooyen et al., 2010). These
three structures will promote highly efﬁcient transmission of the
virus from cells to cells in vivo, as compared to the transmission of
cell-free virus produced by infected cells to uninfected cells.

INFECTION OF DENDRITIC CELLS
Dendritic cells can also be infected with HTLV-1 (Macatonia et al.,
1992). Recently, it was demonstrated that DCs could play a central
role in HTLV-1 infection in vivo. DCs participate in the cell-to-
cell transmission of HTLV-1 in two ways: (1) DCs can capture
and transfer HTLV-1 virions to fresh T cells and (2) infected
DCs can transmit newly made virions to fresh T cells (Macatonia
et al., 1992; Knight et al., 1993; Ceccaldi et al., 2006). Monocyte-
derived DCs form syncytia and can be infected with HTLV-1
upon co-culture with HTLV-1-producing lymphocytes. Mono-
clonal antibodies (MAbs) against DC-speciﬁc ICAM-3-grabbing
non-integrin (DC-SIGN) can inhibit the formation of HTLV-1-
induced syncytia. HTLV-1, however, does not bind directly to
DC-SIGN, and the enhanced syncytium formation is mediated
through the interaction of DC-SIGN with ICAM-2 and ICAM-3.
More recently, DCs have been shown to be readily infected
through cell-free HTLV-1 (Jones et al., 2008). Cell-free HTLV-1
can efﬁciently infect myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs (pDC). DCs
exposed to HTLV-1 efﬁciently transfer virus to autologous primary
CD4+ T cells. This DC-mediated transfer of HTLV-1 involves

heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1),
and DC-SIGN (Jain et al., 2009). Thus, DCs can facilitate HTLV-
1 transmission, dissemination, and persistence through different
mechanisms in vivo.

OTHER CELLULAR FACTORS AFFECTING HTLV-1 INFECTION
IN VITRO
Many cellular factors that affect HTLV-1-induced syncytium for-
mation have been identiﬁed. HTLV-1 Tax affects the expression
of numerous molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1
(VCAM-1) or ICAM-1 (Tanaka et al., 1995; Hildreth et al., 1997;
Daenke et al., 1999). VCAM-1 promotes HTLV-1-induced syn-
cytia formation. ICAM-1, ICAM-3, or VCAM-1 is required for
syncytia formation in K562 induced by HTLV-1-producing MT-2
cells. Antibodies against β-integrins can inhibit this syncytium for-
mation (Daenke et al., 1999). MAbs that inhibit HTLV-1-induced
syncytium formation were produced in mice and shown to rec-
ognize class II MHC molecules (Hildreth, 1998). The heat shock
cognate protein 70 (HSC70) directly binds to gp46. The trans-
duction of human HSC70 cDNA into mouse cells, however, did
not support HTLV-I entry: HSC70 markedly promoted syncytium
formation upon co-cultivation with HTLV-I-producing cells but
did not facilitate HTLV-I entry (Fang et al., 1999). Tetraspanin
(CD82) was also shown to bind HTLV-1 Env proteins (Pique
et al., 2000; Mazurov et al., 2006). Thus, HTLV-1-induced syn-
cytium formation is affected by HSC70, CD82, ICAM-1, ICAM-3,
LFA-1,VCAM-1, integrin β2, integrin β7, or Dlg protein (Blot et al.,
2004). These factors might also affect the spread and pathogenicity
of HTLV-1 in vivo.

Plasma membrane microdomains rich in cholesterol are impor-
tant for the entry of many viruses, including retroviruses. The
depletion of cholesterol using cyclodextrin inhibits the entry of
HTLV-1 and HTLV-I pseudotypes, whereas it did not affect the
receptor-binding activity of HTLV-1. Using SU-Fc, the HTLV-I
receptor was shown to co-localize with a raft-associated marker.
Some MAbs that inhibited HTLV-1-induced syncytium formation
recognized proteins in lipid rafts. The results of these studies sug-
gest that lipid rafts might play a role in HTLV-1-induced syncytium
formation and that cholesterol is required in a post-binding step
(Wielgosz et al., 2005). Intact lipid rafts are also necessary for the
formation of the VS as described above (Igakura et al., 2003; Jolly
and Sattentau, 2005).

ENHANCEMENT OF HTLV-1 INFECTION BY HSPG
The HSPG family is composed of core proteins, such as synde-
cans or glypicans, associated with one or more of the sulfated
polysaccharide side chains heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminogly-
cans. HSPGs have been shown to bind to many viruses, such
as herpes simplex viruses, ﬂaviviruses, picornaviruses, and HIV-
1 (Ibrahim et al., 1999; Shukla et al., 1999) and promote their
receptor-mediated entry.

The presence of HSPGs on the cell surface has been shown to
affect HTLV-1 binding and viral entry (Okuma et al., 2003; Pinon
et al., 2003a). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) inhibited the HTLV-1 infec-
tion of cell lines, indicating that this inhibition is due to the binding
of OPG to cellular HS (Okuma et al., 2003). HTLV-1 SU-Fc binds
to HSPGs on mammalian cells, and the enzymatic removal of

HTLV-1 infection in vivo and in vitro

HSPGs from HeLa and CHOK1 cells also reduced SU-Fc binding
and plating of the HTLV-1 pseudotype (Pinon et al., 2003a). As
compared with SU-Fc binding in HSPG-positive CHOK1 ham-
ster cells, the plating efﬁciency of HTLV-1 in a CHOK1 subline
completely lacking HSPG was markedly reduced but apparently
detectable. Thus, HSPGs might not be absolutely required for
HTLV-1 entry.
More recently, HSPGs were also found to promote the HTLV-1
infection of primary CD4+ T cells and DCs (Jones et al., 2005b,
2006). Resting CD4+ T cells are negative for detectable levels of
HSPGs and HTLV-1 receptor(s). HSPGs are expressed following
immune activation, and the cells become susceptible to HTLV-1
(Nath et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2005a). The enzymatic removal
of HSPGs on the surface of primary CD4+ T cells also reduced
the binding of HTLV-1 SU and HTLV-1 virions. HTLV-1 is more
dependent on HSPGs than HTLV-2 (Jones et al., 2006). Using
HTLV-1/HTLV-2 recombinants, it was shown that HTLV-1 bind-
ing to HSPGs requires the C-terminal domain (CTD) of HTLV-1
SU (amino acids 215–313; Figure 3). Thus, HSPGs play an impor-
tant role in the binding and entry of HTLV-1 into primary CD4+
T cells. Recently, we observed that the susceptibilities of estab-
lished cell lines to HTLV-1 are well correlated with the number of
HS chains, especially heparin-like regions, on the cell surface and
are inversely correlated with the length of the HS chains (Tanaka
et al., 2012).

EFFECTS OF GLUT1 ON HTLV-1 INFECTION
The observation that the transduction of HTLV-1 SU into cells
delays medium acidiﬁcation led to an investigation of glucose
transporter 1 (GLUT1) as a candidate HTLV-1 receptor. Subse-
quently, GLUT1 was found to bind to HTLV-1 SU and promote
HTLV-1 entry into adherent cell lines (Manel et al., 2003b). GLUT1
is a 12-membrane-spanning receptor for glucose transport across
the cell membrane. GLUT1 is expressed in all of mammalian cell
lines that have been tested. The transduction of GLUT1 increases
the susceptibility of markedly HTLV-1-resistant cell lines, such
as MDBK, to HTLV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion and infection
(Coskun and Sutton, 2005). Antibodies against GLUT1, especially
against extracellular loop 1 (ECL1), inhibit syncytia formation,
and the infection of primary CD4+ T lymphocytes (Manel et al.,
2005b; Jin et al., 2006a). Similar to HSPGs, GLUT1 is not detected
in resting lymphocytes. The treatment of resting T lymphocytes
with TGF-β or IL-7 rapidly induces GLUT1 expression on the cell
surface (Jones et al., 2005a).
Quantitative analyses have shown that CD4+ T cells, which
are the primary target of HTLV-1, express higher levels of HSPGs
than CD8+ T cells. In contrast, CD8+ T cells, which are the pri-
mary targets of HTLV-2, express GLUT1 at much higher levels
than CD4+ T cells. These studies suggest that the difference in the
in vitro cellular tropism between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 (Jones et al.,
2006) and the in vivo tropisms of these viruses can be explained
through different interactions between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 Env
proteins and CD4+ or CD8+ T cells.

The glioblastoma U87 cell line expresses low levels of GLUT1
due to a deletion in the GLUT1 gene but is easily infected by the
HTLV-1 pseudotype (Jin et al., 2006b). Among U87 cell clones,
the levels of cell surface GLUT1, however, correlate well with

the plating efﬁciency of HTLV-1 pseudotype viruses, but not
their interactions with SU-Fc. These ﬁndings together with other
observations suggest that molecules other than GLUT1 are also
involved in HTLV-1 entry steps, i.e., attachment and binding,
and GLUT1 affects the post-binding or fusion step of HTLV-1
infection.

EFFECTS OF NEUROPILIN-1 ON HTLV-1 INFECTION
In 2006, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) was reported to display the
expected properties of a HTLV-1 receptor. NRP-1 is a 130-kDa
single membrane-spanning glycoprotein, primarily modiﬁed by
heparan sulfate (HS), or chondroitin sulfate (Soker et al., 1998;
Shintani et al., 2006). NRP-1 is highly conserved among ver-
tebrate species. NRP-1 is a receptor for the chemo-repellent
semaphorin III (Sema III), which is a secreted protein known
to be necessary for neuronal growth and development. NRP-1
can also bind to VEGF165. VEGF is a polypeptide growth fac-
tor with ﬁve alternatively spliced isoforms; VEGF165 is the most
abundant isoform. NPR-1 is one of the immune synapse fac-
tors that is primarily expressed in T cells; its expression is not
detectable in resting T cells but is rapidly upregulated after acti-
vation (Romeo et al., 2002; Tordjman et al., 2002). pDC and
endothelial cells also express NRP-1. Although the in vivo expres-
sion of NRP-1 is relatively limited, NRP-1 is expressed in many
tumor cells and in almost all established cell lines (Soker et al.,
1998).

Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 SU inhibits T cell pro-
liferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, while anti-NRP-1
antibodies also inhibit T cell proliferation (Ghez et al., 2006).
The possibility of the involvement of NRP-1 in HTLV entry has
also been examined (Shintani et al., 2006). NRP-1 over expres-
sion increases HTLV-1 Env-mediated syncytium formation and
promotes HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection, whereas the down-
regulation of endogenous NRP-1 inhibits HTLV infection (Ghez
et al., 2006). Therefore, NRP-1 expression levels in vivo and in vitro
might explain HTLV-1 infection and tropism.

VEGF165 and HTLV-1 SU competitively and HS-dependently
bind to NRP-1. The KPXR motif is critical for the direct binding
of VEGF165 to NRP-1 and this motif is also found in HTLV-
1 SU. The pentapeptide sequence of SU corresponding to this
motif (a.a. 90–94, KKPNR) is highly conserved among HTLV-
1 strains, and this peptide blocks HTLV-1 entry into primary T
cells or DCs (Lambert et al., 2009). These ﬁndings indicate that
NRP-1 plays a pivotal role in HTLV-1 binding. Because NRP-1 is
modiﬁed by HS (Shintani et al., 2006), HTLV-1 SU might inter-
act directly with HS conjugated to NRP-1. Thus, HTLV-1 SU will
bind to NRP-1 in two ways: an HSPG-mediated indirect inter-
action and a KKPNR sequence-mediated direct interaction. This
motif is also the target of neutralizing antibodies (Palker et al.,
1992; Figure 3).
Important roles for NPR-1 and HSPG in HTLV-1 infection of
DCs and CD4+ T cells have also been shown (Ghez et al., 2006;
Jones et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2009). GLUT1 and NRP-1 are con-
centrated in viral synapses (Romeo et al., 2002). In contrast, the
effects of VEGF165 and anti-GLUT1 on the infection of U87 cells,
primary astrocytes or HeLa cells appear to be more complicated
(Jin et al., 2006b, 2010).

HTLV-1 infection in vivo and in vitro

A RECEPTOR COMPLEX MODEL OF HTLV-1 ENTRY
Recent studies have revealed that HTLV-1 infection in vitro
involves interactions with three different molecules, HSPG, NRP-
1, and GLUT1. HTLV-1 SU can bind to NRP-1 in two ways: an
HSPG-mediated indirect interaction and/or a KKPNR sequence-
mediated direct interaction as described above. NRP-1 and GLUT1
can also form a complex in the presence of HTLV-1 Env (Ghez
et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2009). NRP-1 and
GLUT1 as well as HS and NRP-1 will work together to promote
HTLV-1 entry. The level of GLUT1 expression on target cells cor-
relates well with the titer of HTLV-1 pseudotypes, but not with
the level of HTLV-1 binding (Delamarre et al., 1994; Manel et al.,
2005b; Jones et al., 2009), indicating a role for GLUT1 in the fusion
step that follows the initial binding.

The ﬁndings described above lead to a multi-receptor model
for HTLV-1 entry (Ghez et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2011). Namely,
during the initial binding phase, the CTD of HTLV-1 SU interacts
with HSPGs. This interaction would enhance the probability and
stability of the HTLV-1 SU interaction with NRP-1. This binding
to NRP-1 triggers a conformational change to expose the GLUT1-
binding domain. Finally, the interaction of SU with GLUT1 trig-
gers the translocation of TM gp21. In this model, NRP-1 is the
primary binding receptor, while GLUT1 is the fusion receptor.

ROLES OF SU PROTEIN gp46 IN HTLV-1 INFECTION
The HTLV-1 env gene encodes a 488 amino acid precursor pro-
tein, and a 62-kDa protein (gp62) is produced after the addition
of ﬁve N-glycan chains, four in SU, and one in TM. gp62 is cleaved
into the SU gp46 and TM gp21 subunits (Figures 2–4). SU-TM
complexes are organized as trimers and transported to the surface
of infected cells (Delamarre et al., 1996). Site-directed mutagene-
sis demonstrates that the glycosylation of each site is required for
syncytium formation (Pique et al., 1992).

Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 gp46 SU can be organized
into four structural domains (Figure 3): a signal peptide (residues
1–25), an N-terminal region (26–180), a proline-rich region (PRR;
181–215), and a CTD (216–312). The ﬁrst 155 amino acid residues
after the signal peptide are identiﬁed as the RBD (Delamarre et al.,
1994; Kim et al., 2004). This organization of SU is similar to other
retroviruses (Lavillette et al., 1998). The binding of RBD to viral
receptors transmits a PRR-controlled signal to CTD, and this inter-
action leads to the activation of the fusion function of gp21 TM.
The PRR domain is shown to be a hinge region that is subject to
the conformational changes induced by receptor-binding.

The functional domains of the HTLV-1 Env have also been
identiﬁed through analyses of the effects of neutralizing antibod-
ies and speciﬁc mutations in Env on HTLV-1 infectivity (Kuroki
et al., 1992; Palker et al., 1992; Baba et al., 1993; Desgranges et al.,
1994; Tanaka et al., 1994; Londos-Gagliardi et al., 1996). The
residues between 100 and 200 amino acids of the SU have been
shown to be the targets of neutralizing antibodies. The muta-
tions introduced in these regions reduce the ability of HTLV-1
Env to induce syncytium formation and virus infection. Antibod-
ies in 78% of sera of HTLV-I seropositive subjects reacted with a
synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 190–209 (Londos-
Gagliardi et al., 1996). A synthetic peptide, P-197, consisting of

FD, fusion domain; GRS, glycine-rich segment; LZR, leucine zipper-like
region; MSR, membrane-spanning region.

amino acids 197–216 also strongly inhibits HTLV-1-induced cell
fusion of various cells, such as Molt-4 and HeLa (Brighty and
Jassal, 2001). The rat monoclonal antibody LAT-27 recognizes a
peptide epitope (amino acids 191–196) and potently neutralizes
cell-free HTLV-1 infection and inhibits HTLV-1-induced syncy-
tia formation (Tanaka et al., 1991). Antibodies binding to the
PRR domain will prevent SU structural rearrangements leading
to membrane fusion, rather than blocking interactions between
SU and the cellular receptors. Some neutralizing antibodies may
recognize secondary or tertiary structures of HTLV-1 Env pro-
teins, and so the regions recognized by these antibodies are not
necessarily located in the functional domains for HTLV-1 entry.

Furthermore, the adsorption of the neutralizing activities using
a set of shorter peptides has shown that the six residues (KKPNRN;
position 90–95) comprise the minimal neutralizing epitope, while
residues 86–107 are involved in interactions with NRP-1 and
GLUT1 (Figure 3). Speciﬁcally, a pentapeptide (residues 90–94)
blocks the binding of HTLV-1 to cells and NRP-1 (Lambert et al.,
2009). Similarly, site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed
that D106 and Y114 of SU are important for GLUT1-binding
(Manel et al., 2003b). These studies have suggested regions impor-
tant for the interaction of HTLV-1 SU with the cellular factors
(Figure 3).

ROLES OF TM PROTEIN gp21 IN HTLV-1 INFECTION
Retrovirus entry into cells occurs through the fusion of the viral
envelope either with the cell membrane or with the endosomal
membrane after internalization through an endocytic pathway
(Mothes et al., 2000; Marsh and Helenius, 2006). The entry process
starts by a binding step mediated by SU as described above and
a subsequent TM-mediated fusion step. During virus produc-
tion, TM is maintained in an inactive conformation through an
association with SU, and the fusion domain (FD) in TM is not
exposed. This conformation prevents premature Env activation
that will lead to virus inactivation. The hydrophobic FD is located
at its N-terminal region (Figure 3). The dissociation of TM from
the SU-TM complex results in the projection of FD into the cell
membrane. This dissociation involves the formation of a six-helix

coiled-coil bundle that induces membrane fusion (Maerz et al.,
2000; Marsh and Helenius, 2006; Mirsaliotis et al., 2007; Lamb
et al., 2009).

Four domains conserved in retroviral TM glycoproteins are
also present in HTLV-1 TM (Kobe et al., 1999): (1) an amino-
terminal hydrophobic domain with characteristics of a FD (Kim
et al., 2000); (2) a leucine zipper-like region (LZR) with an amphi-
pathic α-helical structure capable of self-association as a coiled-
coil (Maerz et al., 2000; Pinon et al., 2003b; Mirsaliotis et al.,
2007; Lamb et al., 2009); (3) a domain containing the conserved
motif, which forms an intramolecular disulﬁde link; and (4) a FD
linked to the coiled-coil core through a conserved sequence rich
in glycine [glycine-rich segment (GRS), M(326) to S(337); Wilson
et al., 2005; Figure 3].

Synthetic peptides based on the leash and α-helical region
(LHR) of gp21 are potent inhibitors of virus entry into cells.
Inhibitory peptides target the triple-stranded coiled-coil motif of
the fusion-active gp21 and block its conformational change (Mir-
saliotis et al., 2008): These peptides are expected to function in a
similar way to clinically available enfuvirtide (T-20) type inhibitors
of HIV-1.

ISOMERIZATION IN HTLV-1 Env PROTEINS
The SU and TM subunits are associated through an inter-subunit
disulﬁde link. Receptor-binding or low pH in the endosome
decreases this association, leading to dissociation of the SU subunit
from the virus and translocation of the TM subunit for membrane
fusion (Pinter et al., 1997; Barnard et al., 2004; Wallin et al., 2004;
Li et al., 2008). In the case of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) Env,
the inter-subunit disulﬁde has been shown to link the CXXC motif
in SU to the conserved CX6CC motif in the TM, and these motifs
are also conserved in deltaretroviruses, such as HTLV-1. The inter-
subunit disulﬁde is then rearranged into a disulﬁde isomer within
the motif (Figures 3 and 4).

Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Env proteins contain the
disulﬁde isomerization motifs C(225)XXC(228; e.g., CIVC in gp46
SU) and CX6CC(401; e.g., CKALQERCC in gp21 TM; Figures 3
and 4). Thus, it has been proposed that C(228) is linked to C(401;
Li et al., 2008). This disulﬁde link will be rearranged through iso-
merization into the intra-subunit disulﬁde link between C(225)
and C(228). This rearrangement results in SU dissociation and TM
translocation for membrane fusion. Thus, similar to MuLV Env,
the membrane fusion of HTLV-1 Env was shown to occur under
neutral conditions at the cell surface (Li et al., 2008; Figure 4). A
set of these motifs is lacking in Rous sarcoma virus or HIV-1 but
BLV (Barnard et al., 2004; Li et al., 2008).

Murine leukemia virus Env shows low spontaneous inter-
subunit disulﬁde isomerization activity (Li et al., 2008), and MuLV
and BLV are relatively stable in culture medium (Shinagawa et al.,
2012). In contrast, cell-free HTLV-1 shows a low infectivity. The
low infectivity might be related to a high spontaneous inter-
subunit disulﬁde isomerization activity. We observed that the

FIGURE 4 | Isomerization of Env proteins. The scheme is shown
according to the model by Li et al. (2008), Pinter et al. (1997). The disulﬁde
bond is present between C(228) of SU gp46 and C(401) of TM gp21 (A).
Upon the isomerization, this bond is cleaved and the new disulﬁde bond is
made between C(225) and C(228) of gp46, leading to SU dissociation and
TM translocation (B).

spontaneous dissociation of SU from SU-TM complexes in HTLV-
1 virions occurs readily over a wide range of temperatures: the
half-life of HTLV-1 infectivity at various temperatures (0–37˚C) is
as short as 30–60 min (Shinagawa et al., 2012). Derse et al. (2001)
have, however, reported that the half-life of HTLV-1 is about 3.5 h
at 37˚C: in their system, HTLV-1 pseudotype was used and its
infectivity was measured by luciferase assays. We have assumed
that the isomerization of HTLV-1 Env will occur spontaneously
and rapidly in culture medium and HTLV-1 will easily lose the
infectivity. HTLV-1 can afford to have this property since most
HTLV-1 infections in vivo occur from cell-to-cell.

CONCLUSION
Cellular factors important for HTLV-1 infection and persistence
in vivo and in vitro have been investigated for 30 years. Recently,
three factors have been found to play crucial roles in HTLV-1 entry:
HSPGs, glucose transporter GLUT1, and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1).
These molecules have been shown to form complexes with HTLV-
1 SU to promote HTLV-1 entry into primary cells and established
cell lines. The functional domains of the HLTV-1 Env proteins
and their interactions with these molecules have been elucidated.
However, mutant cells lacking an enzyme synthesizing HS, xylosyl
transferase, or mutant cells expressing little GLUT1 are appar-
ently susceptible to HTLV-1. It has not been proven whether cells
that are completely resistant to HTLV-1 will become susceptible
to HTLV-1 when all or a combination of these three molecules are
transduced into the cells.
