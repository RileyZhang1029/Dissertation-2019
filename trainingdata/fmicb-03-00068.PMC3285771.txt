In this review, we report that the receptor of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), carcinoembry-
onic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), is an important determinant of
mouse susceptibility to MHV infection. This ﬁnding was revealed by using mouse strains
with two different allelic forms of the MHV receptor, Ceacam1a and Ceacam1b. Although
previous studies indicated that susceptibility is determined by a single gene, Ceacam1, our
recent work in gene-replaced mice with chimeric Ceacam1 pointed toward the involvement
of other host factors (genes) in the susceptibility. Studies on mouse susceptibility to MHV,
as well as the factors involved in their susceptibility, are overviewed.

INTRODUCTION
Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a murine coronavirus which
causes a wide range of diseases in the mouse and rat, including
hepatitis, enteritis, respiratory diseases, and encephalomyelitis in
the central nervous system (Wege et al., 1982). There are also great
differences in tissue tropism and virulence among various strains
and isolates of MHV (Hirano et al., 1981; Wege et al., 1982). Com-
plex factors, such as age and immunological status of the host ani-
mal, dose, and route of virus inoculation, affect disease outcomes
(Taguchi et al., 1977; Hirano et al., 1981). Naturally occurring
cases of MHV infections in mouse colonies are generally enteric
infections that are not highly pathogenic to immunocompetent
adult mice, while virus infections are mostly of a persistent nature
(Ishida et al., 1978; Homberger, 1997). Viruses shed in the feces
from persistently infected mice are a source of acute and chronic
fatal diseases encountered in mice prone to MHV infection, e.g.,
diarrhea of suckling mice and wasting syndrome in immunodeﬁ-
cient nude mice (Hirano et al., 1975; Tamura et al., 1977; Ishida
et al., 1978). Thus, the asymptomatic infection of adult mice is a
major problem in animal facilities where MHV-free mice are used
for experiments and evokes serious problems in terms of main-
taining animals of sufﬁcient quality to allow scientists to perform
experiments with high reproducibility and reliability.

It is well known that there is a difference in susceptibility to
MHV infection among mouse strains. A number of works have
reported differing susceptibilities to MHV infection among mouse
strains from 1960 to the present (Bang and Warwick, 1960; Taguchi
et al., 1976; Stohlman and Frelinger, 1978; Knobler et al., 1981).
Bang and Warwick (1960) showed that the C3H inbred strain was
resistant to MHV-2 infection, while Princeton outbred mice were
deemed susceptible. They further showed that susceptibility was
determined by a single gene, expressed in macrophages (Bang and
Warwick, 1960). Stohlman and Frelinger (1978) reported, using

a neurotropic MHV, JHMV strain, that SJL mice are resistant,
while others are susceptible. By cross and backcross studies, they
indicated that susceptibility is dominant, as determined by a major
gene and a gene marginally inﬂuencing its susceptibility (Stohlman
and Frelinger, 1978). Thereafter, Smith et al. (1984) identiﬁed the
locus of the gene that determines the susceptibility of mice to
MHV infection to be on chromosome 7. From those ﬁndings,
it was postulated that mouse susceptibility to MHV infection is
dominant and determined mostly by a single gene located on
chromosome 7. On the basis of those ﬁndings, Holmes and her
colleagues identiﬁed an MHV receptor.

IDENTIFICATION OF MHV RECEPTOR
Holmes and co-workers tried to ﬁnd a receptor protein by using
susceptible BALB/c and resistant SJL/J mice (Boyle et al., 1987).
They prepared cell membrane fractions from MHV target tissues,
intestines, and liver, of those mice and showed, by using a viral
overlay protein blot assay (whereby virions bind to the protein
on a membrane ﬁlter prepared by Western blotting), that BALB/c
mice express a molecule of 110–120 kDa on cell membranes to
bind MHV virus particles. However, in the same fraction of SJL
mice, they failed to ﬁnd the protein that would bind MHV (Boyle
et al., 1987; Williams et al., 1990). Accordingly, they speculated
that the protein was a receptor for MHV and determines mouse
susceptibility. Thereafter, they isolated the protein and analyzed
the partial amino acid sequence of the protein, which suggested
to them that the protein is similar to a carcinoembryonic anti-
gen, CEA (Williams et al., 1991). They ﬁnally isolated a cDNA
clone and identiﬁed the protein to be a biliary glycoprotein of the
CEA family (Dveksler et al., 1991), now called carcinoembryonic
antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1; Beauchemin
et al., 1999). The expression of this protein in non-permissive cells
converted them into cells that were permissive to MHV infection,

MHV receptor and mouse susceptibility

a ﬁnding that indicated this protein serves as an MHV receptor
(Dveksler et al., 1991). These ﬁndings suggested to them that the
susceptibility of the mouse to MHV infection is determined by
the presence or absence of this molecule. Soon after these ﬁndings
were published, they reported that the CEACAM1 counterpart
is expressed in the SJL (Dveksler et al., 1993b); however, they also
reported that the CEACAM1 counterpart found in SJL is also func-
tional as a receptor for MHV when expressed in non-permissive
cells, although the receptor functionality is less efﬁcient compared
with the CEACAM1 found in BALB/c (Dveksler et al., 1993b).
Holmes and co-workers explained that the relatively small differ-
ence in receptor function between BALB/c CEACAM1 and SJL
CEACAM1 could result in the very large biological differences in
the multiple cycle infections that are required to cause disease in
animals (Dveksler et al., 1993b). There is a slight difference in
amino acid sequences between CEACAM1 found in most mouse
strains and CEACAM1 expressed in SJL in the MHV-binding
region (Rao et al., 1997; Beauchemin et al., 1999); these are allelic
forms and called CEACAM1a for BALB/c type and CEACAM1b
for SJL type (Beauchemin et al., 1999). In contrast to the hypothe-
sis by Holmes and co-workers, Yokomori and Lai (1992) expressed
CEACAM1a derived from C57BL/6 and CEACAM1b from SJL
mice in MHV-non-permissive cells and found no signiﬁcant dif-
ference in viral growth between cells expressing CEACAM1a and
those with CEACAM1b, which may mean that the susceptibility
difference observed between those two mouse strains may not be
attributable to MHV receptor protein.

STRUCTURE AND MHV-BINDING ACTIVITY OF CEACAM1s
There are at least four different types of CEACAM1 isoforms
derived by alternative splicing (Beauchemin et al., 1999). CEA-
CAM1 belongs to an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and is
composed of an ectodomain, transmembrane domain (TM), and
cytoplasmic tail (Cy). The ectodomain consists of four Ig constant
region-like domains, i.e., the N, A1, B, and A2 domains from the
N terminus of the molecule (Dveksler et al., 1991; Beauchemin
et al., 1999). Alternative splicing generates the molecules with two
ectodomains, composed of N and A2, while those four- and two-
domain forms have either long or short Cy, which results in the
four different forms of CEACAM1 (Beauchemin et al., 1999). Also
as described above, there are two allelic forms in CEACAM1, 1a,
and 1b, and, thus, at least eight totally different MHV receptor
molecules exist (Beauchemin et al., 1999). Recently, some CEA-
CAM1 molecules deleting TM and Cy were found in intestinal
epithelium and intestinal secretions, and those neutralize MHV
(Terahara et al., 2009).

The molecule on MHV virion that binds to the receptor is the
spike (S) protein with ca. 180–200 kDa class I fusion glycoprotein
(Bosch et al., 2003). One spike is composed of a trimer of the S
protein. The S protein of most MHV is cleaved in the middle of
the molecule, and the N terminal subunit is called the S1 and C
terminal subunits S2, respectively (Sturman et al., 1985). N ter-
minal 330 amino acids in S1 are responsible for receptor binding
(Kubo et al., 1994), and S2 is critical for envelope–cell membrane
fusion, namely, cell entry (Bosch et al., 2003).

The N domain of CEACAM1 alone is sufﬁcient to bind MHV; a
soluble form consisting of the N domain alone works efﬁciently to
bind to MHV (Dveksler et al., 1993a; Miura et al., 2004). Also, the

N domain alone can neutralize viruses and induce conformational
change in the S protein. Moreover, the binding of the N domain to
the S protein of MHV induces the fusion activation of the S pro-
tein (Taguchi and Matsuyama, 2002; Miura et al., 2004). However,
when the N domain alone is expressed on the membrane (which
has both TM and Cy), this molecule fails to work as a functional
receptor (Dveksler et al., 1993a; Miura et al., 2004). This may be
due to its short molecule that is buried among various cell surface
molecules and thus fails to have a chance to attach to the viri-
ons (Dveksler et al., 1993a). We have compared the virus-binding
activity of CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b. Soluble CEACAM1a and
CEACAM1b composed of N and A2 domains prepared on nitro-
cellulose paper were allowed to attach to an MHV virion (viral
protein blot assay). By this method, CEACAM1a binds to virions
more than 300-fold efﬁciently when compared with CEACAM1b
(Ohtsuka et al., 1996). We also examined the neutralization activity
of the two soluble proteins, ﬁnding that, in this assay, CEACAM1a
is highly reactive and neutralizes MHV more than 300-fold efﬁ-
ciently than does CEACAM1b. These results are in agreement with
the observations of the Holmes lab (Boyle et al., 1987). However,
when those proteins are expressed in MHV-non-permissive BHK
cells, CEACAM1a exhibits only a 10- to 30-fold higher receptor
function when compared with that of CEACAM1b, and, again,
this ﬁnding is similar to those obtained by the Holmes lab (Boyle
et al., 1987). Accordingly, from these ﬁndings, we concluded that
the small difference in receptor function between CEACAM1a and
CEACAM1b will be ampliﬁed after several viral growths, as also
postulated by Holmes and her collaborators. As for the receptor
binding site in the N domain of CEACAM1, Gallagher and co-
workers reported six contiguous amino acids from 38 to 43 in the
N domain different between CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b play an
important role in the differences seen in receptor function (Rao
et al., 1997). Others showed that amino acids 34–52 are involved
in virus-binding (Wessner et al., 1998).

ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF CEACAM1 IN THE MHV
SUSCEPTIBILITY OR RESISTANCE OF MICE
The above data suggested to us that CEACAM1 is an impor-
tant factor to determine the susceptibility of mice and could be
a product of the gene responsible for susceptibility mapped in
a locus on chromosome 7 by Smith et al. (1984). This idea is
strengthened by the fact that the MHV receptor Ceacam1 gene
is mapped to the same region on chromosome 7 (Robbins et al.,
1991). If the CEACAM1 receptor is a determinant of suscepti-
bility, and susceptibility is dominant over resistance, then mice
with CEACAM1a/CEACAM1a and CEACAM1a/CEACAM1b are
susceptible and only mice with a CEACAM1b/CEACAM1b phe-
notype, such as SJL mice, are resistant. To assess this possibility,
we have mated BALB/c and SJL to generate F1 mice, and then
we obtained mice backcrossed to SJL. We also produced F2 mice
from BALB/c and SJL mice. By using these mice, we examined
the relationship between the mouse genotype of Ceacam1 and
its susceptibility to MHV. Of more than 120 backcrossed and F2
mice, those with Ceacam1a/Ceacam1a and Ceacam1a/Ceacam1b
were fully susceptible, while those with Ceacam1b/Ceacam1b were
resistant (Ohtsuka and Taguchi, 1997). These experimental results
are well in accordance with the hypothesis, i.e., that mouse sus-
ceptibility to MHV is determined by a receptor gene. We have also

MHV receptor and mouse susceptibility

studied the relationship between MHV susceptibility and CEA-
CAM1 allelic forms by using wild mice (Ohtsuka et al., 2001). The
study showed that most of subspecies of wild mice distributed
worldwide express both or either CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b.
Among those mice, CEACAM1a-expressing ones showed high sus-
ceptibility to MHV, while those with CEACAM1b were not highly
susceptible, being in good agreement to the result and hypothesis
obtained by mouse cross and backcross experiment shown above.
It has been reported in studies using gene-knockout mice that
CEACAM1a is a critical factor for mouse susceptibility to MHV
infection (Blau et al., 2001; Hemmila et al., 2004). Beauchemin
and co-workers produced mice whose Ceacam1 gene is partially
disrupted or mice in which the Ceacam1a gene was deleted and
showed that those mice showed a reduced susceptibility and no
susceptibility to MHV infection, respectively (Blau et al., 2001;
Hemmila et al., 2004). These ﬁndings clearly show that CEACAM1
is an important factor in determining the susceptibility to MHV.
However, these studies did not explain the difference of susceptibil-
ity to MHV infection observed between BALB/c with CEACAM1a
and SJL with CEACAM1b receptor protein.

ANALYSIS OF GENE-REPLACED MICE
If the differing susceptibilities between CEACAM1a-expressing
mice and SJL with CEACAM1b are determined by CEACAM1,
then MHV-susceptible mice with CEACAM1a are converted to SJL
type-resistant mice, when the Ceacam1a mouse gene is replaced
with a Ceacam1b gene. We have produced C57BL/6 (B6) mice
whose original Ceacam1a gene is replaced by a Ceacam1b gene
(Hirai et al., 2010). Since it has been revealed that the chimeric
CEACAM1a, which is replaced with 1–70 amino acids of the N
terminus of N domain with CEACAM1b counterpart, functioned
as CEACAM1b, suggesting that there is a critical region in 1–70
amino acids to determine the difference of receptor functional-
ity between CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b (Wessner et al., 1998).
Thus, we produced B6 mice whose N terminal region (1–70 amino
acids) is replaced by CEACAM1b (we call it CEACAM1ba) to
see the mouse susceptibility is determined by CEACAM1. CEA-
CAM1ba has two N-linked glycosylation sites in the N domain
as CEACM1b, while CEACAM1a has three sites, showing that
chimeric CEACAM1ba is more like CEACAM1b rather than CEA-
CAM1a. Those gene-replaced mice expressed the chimeric protein
in the tissues or cells where CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b were
expressed in B6 and SJL mice, respectively. It was also revealed
that there is no signiﬁcant difference in the expression level of
CEACACM1a and CEACAM1ba in B6 and chimeric B6 mice
(Hirai et al., 2010). Additionally, the chimeric CEACAM1 did not
react with the CEACAM1a-speciﬁc monoclonal antibody, CC1
as reported previously (Wessner et al., 1998). We then exam-
ined the susceptibility of mice having a chimeric Ceacam1. The
gene-replaced mice, when compared to B6 mice, were resistant to
a lethal dose of MHV-A59 infection, a ﬁnding similar to those in
SJL mice that were resistant to the infection. However, when we

examined virus growth in B6, SJL, and the gene-replaced mice,
high titer of MHV were detected in the liver and other target tis-
sues of B6 mice, while low levels of virus titer were recorded in
SJL mice, ﬁndings which are similar to the results we have thus
far obtained. Interestingly, no virus growth was detected in the
mice having gene-replacement with chimeric CEACAM1, indicat-
ing the gene-replaced mice showed a much higher resistance to
MHV infection than did the SJL mice. Since the virus-binding
domain is derived from SJL, the chimeric mouse susceptibility
should be similar to that in SJL mice, if our hypothesis is cor-
rect. However, at the moment, we have no convincing explanation
on the difference in susceptibility of SJL and chimeric mice with
identical MHV-binding site on CEACAM1.

Two other molecules, CEACAM2 (Nedellec et al., 1994) and
pregnancy-speciﬁc glycoprotein (PSG; Chen et al., 1995), have
so far been reported to work as MHV receptor. These proteins,
however, seem unlikely to function as an MHV receptor in the
mouse, since CEACAM1 knockout mice produced in Beauchemin
lab showed complete resistance to MHV-A59 infection (Hemmila
et al., 2004),. Moreover, as there are no substantial differences in
amino acid sequences in those two receptor proteins expressed
in B6 and SJL, there is little possibility that those proteins are
involved in the differences of MHV susceptibility between SJL and
chimeric mice. One point to be further studied is the effect of FVB
Cre mouse that is used to exclude neomycin resistant gene from
initially produced chimeric mouse (Hirai et al., 2010). To exclude
the FVB mouse genes, we performed the backcross of neomycin
deleted mouse to B6 mouse by 11 generations, however, some
FVB mouse gene still remaining in backcrossed mice could have
some unexpected effects on the chimeric mice. It is important to
study whether any of FVB mouse genes are involved in the high
resistance of chimeric mice.

We did observe that peritoneal macrophages from chimeric
mice, which express chimeric CEACAM1ba, were resistant to
MHV, while chimeric CEACAM1 expressed in cultured cell lines,
such as BHK, showed MHV susceptibility, slightly lower than
that in cells expressing CEACAM1b. From these ﬁndings, it could
be postulated that some cellular factor(s) other than CEACAM1
could modify animal susceptibility. This idea appears to be in
accordance with ﬁndings by Stohlman and Frelinger (1978), who
postulated two factors to determine mouse strain differences in
susceptibility to MHV infection. Studies to elucidate such factors
are in progress.
