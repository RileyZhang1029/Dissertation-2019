Malignant transformation of epithelial cells is frequently as-
sociated with the alteration of glycosylation pathways. Tn is
a common tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen present
in 90% of human carcinomas and its expression correlates
with metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Despite its rel-
evance, the functional role of Tn in tumor biology has not
been ﬁrmly established probably for the lack of appropri-
ate experimental tools. Our aims were to produce highly
reactive monoclonal antibodies against Tn making use of
synthetically produced Tn and to test their usefulness for
in vivo imaging as well as to deﬁne their potential func-
tional activity in tumor cell spread. We immunized mice with
Tn clustered on cationized BSA and screened the positive
hybridomas with Tn-biotinylated alginate. Enzyme-linked
immuno sorbent assay and immunoﬂuorescence assays re-
vealed that the most reactive anti-Tn IgM mAb (2154F12A4)
selectively recognized Tn on the MCF7 breast cancer cell
line since its binding to the cell membrane was completely
abolished by preincubation with puriﬁed Tn. Importantly,
QDot 800-conjugated mAb injected in MCF7-tumor bear-
ing mice speciﬁcally bound to primary tumor lesions as well
as to metastases in lymph nodes. In addition, this mAb was
able to inhibit cancer cell adhesion to lymphatic endothe-
lium suggesting a novel involvement of Tn in the lymphatic
dissemination of cancer cells and hypothesizing future ap-
plications in inhibiting lymphatic metastases.

Introduction

Altered glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer cells (Brooks et al.
2008). The so-called tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens

(TACAs) are structures originated during neoplastic transfor-
mation from changes in multiple genes within the glycosylation
pathways. They greatly contribute to the malignant phenotype
of cancer cells (Escrevente et al. 2006; Serpa et al. 2006; Sewell
et al. 2006), inﬂuencing functional processes such as cell
adhesion, migration, and metastasis (Baldus et al. 2004). The
most common TACAs are Tn and TF antigens as well as their
sialylated forms. They derive from an incomplete elongation of
O-glycan saccharide chains leading to the expression of shorter
carbohydrate structures in multiple glycoproteins and in mucins
(Springer 1984; Slovin et al. 2005; Galonic and Gin 2007). Both
Tn and TF have been used clinically as prognostic indicators
of cancer and have been detected immunologically in primary
breast cancer tissues, lymph nodes, and distant metastases
(Kumar et al. 2005). Whereas the function of Tn remains unclear,
TF has been shown to be involved in cancer cell proliferation,
adhesion, and migration and recent evidences suggest that TF
may be actively involved in tumor metastasis promoting several
key cell–cell interactions (Yu 2007). Tn (GalNAc-α-O-Ser/Thr:
the innermost O-linked structure), an early biomarker of cancer,
both in humans (Li et al. 2009) and in animal models (Babino
et al. 2000), which is usually masked by additional sugar
residues in normal tissues, was characterized as one of the most
speciﬁc human cancer-associated structures, and it was detected
in 90% of human carcinomas (Springer 1997). Tn and its sialy-
lated derivate STn correlated with metastatic potential and poor
prognosis in many cancers (Kawaguchi 2005) including cervi-
cal (Terasawa et al. 1996), lung (Laack et al. 2002), colorectal
(Konno et al. 2002), breast (Fernandez Madrid et al. 2005), and
gastric carcinomas (Pinho et al. 2007). Moreover, Tn induced an
effective immune response against cancer cells (Lo-Man et al.
2004; Ingale et al. 2007; Li et al. 2009).

The adhesion of cancer cells to the vascular endothelium is
an essential rate-limiting step in cancer metastasis. The current
knowledge of the molecular mechanism of cancer cell adhesion
to endothelium is largely derived from studies performed on
blood endothelial cells (BECs) highlighting the involvement of
a wide array of molecules, such as cadherins, integrins, Ig class
of cell adhesion molecules, selectins, carbohydrates, and their
lectin receptors (Miles et al. 2008). In particular, the interaction
between TF and Galectin-3, a galactoside-binding lectin (Liu
and Rabinovich 2005), expressed on BECs has been shown to
promote the adhesion of breast cancer cells to blood endothe-
lium (Glinsky et al. 2000, 2001, 2003; Khaldoyanidi et al. 2003;
Zou et al. 2005; Yu et al. 2007). Consequently, an anti-TF mAb
inhibited in vivo breast cancer metastasis (Heimburg et al. 2006).
In contrast, the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer cells
and lymphatic endothelium adhesion are still poorly understood.
It was demonstrated that changes in the expression of cell adhe-
sion molecules by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in inﬂam-
mation may promote tumor metastasis via lymphatics. Several

Tn antigen in the cancer cell–lymphatic endothelium interaction

Fig. 1. Experimental strategy. (A) The approach followed for the selection of speciﬁc anti-Tn mAbs is schematically illustrated. Tn conjugated with cBSA was
used for mice immunization, whereas Tn conjugated with biotinylated alginate was used for mouse serum titration and for the screening of anti-Tn clones. The
selected hybridomas were further tested by ELISA and immunoﬂuorescence on a highly expressing Tn breast cancer cell line (MCF7) and ﬁnally, after Qdot
conjugation, were used for in vivo imaging. (B) Schematic representation of Tn-conjugates. The three compounds were obtained starting from pure Tn antigen,
synthesized in seven steps from 2-azido-2-deoxy-1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl galactose, exploiting the trichloroacetimidate strategy. All the derivatives were obtained
applying the same carbodiimide chemistry: EDC and NHS were used as activating agents for the carboxylic group in the MES buffer, pH 6.0. The products were
fully characterized before further utilization.

studies suggest that CLEVER-1 and macrophage mannose re-
ceptor I (Irjala et al. 2003; Marttila-Ichihara et al. 2008), as well
as ICAM-1 (Kawai et al. 2009), may be important mediators of
cancer cell adhesion to the lymphatic endothelium. Moreover,
the expression of Vicia villosa agglutinin-binding carbohydrates
correlated with the aggressiveness of breast cancer hypothesiz-
ing that Tn was involved in lymphatic metastasis (Kawaguchi
et al. 2006).

Altogether the above-mentioned evidences suggest that Tn is
a valuable target for early diagnosis and for the development
of novel therapeutic approaches of neoplastic diseases. Active
immunotherapy, using vaccines targeted toward Tn antigen, has
already been evaluated with promising results (Slovin et al.
2003; Lo-Man et al. 2004; Freire et al. 2006; O’Boyle et al.
2006; Ingale et al. 2007; Gilewski et al. 2007; Li et al. 2009). A
number of anti-Tn IgG and IgM antibodies have been generated
(Hirohashi et al. 1985; Takahashi et al. 1988; Numata et al.
1990; O’Boyle and Wright 1994; Avichezer et al. 1997; Oppezzo
et al. 2000; Kannagi and Hakomori 2001; Ando et al. 2008)
and the anti-tumor activities of some of them already reported
(Takahashi et al. 1988; Avichezer et al. 1997; Oppezzo et al.
2000; Ando et al. 2008).

The ﬁrst aim of the present investigation was to produce
highly reactive mAbs against Tn making use of novel conju-
gated compounds of Tn antigen. The second aim of the study
was to determine if the mAbs produced were capable to detect
tumor cells in vivo and if they display any functional activity.
We succeeded in isolating a speciﬁc mAb against Tn. This an-
tibody reacted in vitro and in vivo with a Tn-expressing breast
cancer cell line, MCF7 (Valentiner et al. 2005). Importantly,
when injected in MCF7-tumor bearing mice, this mAb speciﬁ-
cally bound to primary tumor lesions as well as to lymph node
metastases. Moreover, it was able to inhibit cancer cell adhesion
to LECs pointing out a novel involvement of Tn in this interac-
tion and suggesting its future potential application in inhibiting
lymphatic metastases.

Results

Experimental strategy
Considering the low immunogenicity and the consequent
difﬁculties in obtaining efﬁcient antibodies targeting small car-
bohydrate antigens, we based our strategy on Tn-antigen cluster-
ization using different polymeric scaffolds and on a stepwise se-
lection of the most reactive antibody producing clones. Brieﬂy,
the glycoaminoacid GalNAc-α-O-Ser (Tn) was synthesized,
conjugated with cBSA for mice immunization and with biotiny-
lated alginate for serum titration and anti-Tn clone screening.
The selected hybridomas were further tested by enzyme-linked
immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoﬂuorescence on a
highly expressing Tn breast cancer cell line and, after conjuga-
tion with QDot, were used for in vivo imaging (Figure 1A).

Synthesis of Tn-conjugates
Brieﬂy, for the synthesis of Tn antigen (unpublished data), 2-
azido-2-deoxy-1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl galactose was selectively
deacetylated at the anomeric position with hydrazine hydrate
(2h, RT), which was further converted into trichloroacetimi-
date (CCl3CN/CH2Cl2). The activated sugar was conjugated to
N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-serine benzylester (TMSOTf, −20
◦
C).

Successively, the azido group was reduced (NaBH4) and acety-
lated (1/1 pyridine/Ac2O), and ﬁnally all the protecting groups
were removed, giving rise to the product as the anomeric mix-
ture with a global yield equal to 20%. The α-form of Tn, which
represents 65% of the mixture, was separated with HPLC-UV
(amino-derivatized column, Luna NH2, 250 × 10 mm, 10 μm
Phenomenex, eluent 30/70 water/acetonitrile) and recovered as
pure anomer. The glycoaminoacid was then further modiﬁed
through conjugation with cBSA or biotinylated alginate; alter-
natively, it was directly linked to biotin. The three reactions
were performed exploiting the carbodiimide chemistry, which
leads to the formation of a new amidic bond (Figure 1B). The
derivatized polymers were puriﬁed through extensive dialysis
against doubly distilled water, while the puriﬁcation conditions
of the biotinylated antigen were ﬁrst optimized with LC-MS. In-
deed, notwithstanding the presence of the biotin derivative, the
compound was only slightly detectable by UV; in order to verify
peak separation and elution times, it was necessary to monitor
them with MS. After assessment of the separation conditions,
the puriﬁcation was carried out on preparative scale using an
HPLC-UV setup.

Immunization, serological responses, and antibody selection
Three series of immunization were performed on a group of
BALB/c mice (n = 2, each) by weekly intraperitoneal injections
of 200 μg of Tn-cBSA. The levels of anti-Tn immunoglobulins
in the mouse sera were monitored by ELISA. As shown in
Figure 2, Tn-alginate conjugation signiﬁcantly improved the
binding of speciﬁc antibodies to the target antigen, thus proving
the efﬁcacy of antigen clusterization. The most reactive clones
in a solid-phase ELISA on Tn-alginate (data not shown) resulted
to be IgM and were then assayed for their ability to bind Tn
expressed on the surface of tumor cells. For this purpose, an
ELISA assay was performed on 96-well-plated MCF7 cells and
clone 2154F12 showed the highest reactivity (Figure 3A). The

latter was subcloned and the resulting subclones were tested
by immunoﬂuorescence on MCF7 cells. mAb 2154F12A4 was
the most efﬁcient in labeling the breast cancer cell line (Figure
3B) in a membrane-speciﬁc manner, as evidenced by xz and yz
sections of confocal images (Figure 3C). The speciﬁc binding
of the antibody to the MCF7-expressed Tn was further assessed
following a solid-phase preclearing test. For this purpose,
the 2154F12A4 supernatant was ﬁrst incubated with different
amounts of plastic adsorbed-Tn and then it was assayed on
MCF7 cells. The dose-dependent abrogation of binding to
MCF7 cells demonstrated the speciﬁcity of mAb 2154F12A4
(Figure 3D).

In vivo imaging
To evaluate the ability of mAb 2154F12A4 to bind Tn-positive
cells in vivo, MCF7 cells were injected subcutaneously in the
right ﬂank and in the mammary fat pad of nude mice and
stimulated by weekly injections of β-estradiol. At 90 days, when
the tumor masses reached 5–7 mm, the QDot800-conjugated
2154F12A4 was injected into the tail vein and the ﬂuorescent
signal was recorded with the IVIS Lumina Imaging System.
After 72 h, the mAb strongly stained the ﬂank tumor mass
(Figure 4A) and the inguinal lymph nodes (Figure 4B). Since
the limitations of the instrument sensitivity are related to the
depth from which the signal is emitted, the mAb localization
was further investigated by excising the tissues of interest.
The ﬂank tumor mass and the inguinal lymph nodes still
demonstrated a high antibody binding (Figure 4C and D). In
addition, the mammary pad as well as the axillary lymph nodes,
which both were negative at the in vivo analysis, resulted
positive (Figure 4E and F). Notably, the ex vivo analysis
evidenced an higher antibody binding in the homolateral right
inguinal and axillary lymph nodes, suggesting the presence of a
larger number of MCF7 metastatic cells in the draining lymph
nodes from the tumor implanted in the right ﬂank. The signal
emitted by lung, liver, kidney, and spleen were negligible (data
not shown) conﬁrming the binding speciﬁcity of the antibody.

Immunohistochemical analysis of MCF7 tumors and
metastatic lymph nodes
To assess whether the QDot 800-conjugated mAb had identiﬁed
real metastatic cells in vivo, cryostat sections of the primary
tumors as well as those of inguinal and axillary lymph nodes
were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. For this purpose, an
anti-pan cytokeratin antibody, representing a speciﬁc marker
of epithelial as well as of carcinoma cells such as MCF7
(Gusterson et al. 2005), was used. As expected, the cryostat
sections of the tumors were strongly positive for the anti-
cytokeratin antibody (Figure 5A, brown staining). In addition,
an intense staining was present in the right inguinal and axillary
lymph nodes, demonstrating the presence of metastatic MCF7
cells in these tissues (Figure 5B and C). The cytokeratin
staining was weaker in the controlateral lymph nodes (Figure
5D and E), in accordance with the lower ﬂuorescence signal
recorded by in vivo imaging (Figure 4D and F).

Inhibition of cancer cell adhesion to lymphatic endothelium
Based on the suggestion formulated by Kawaguchi and col-
leagues (2006) that Tn is implicated in the molecular mecha-
nism of lymphatic metastasis, we next investigated the func-

1060

tional signiﬁcance of the interaction of tumor cells expressing
high levels of Tn with LECs. Considering the phenotypic het-
erogeneity of LECs isolated from different organs (Garrafa et al.
2005), as ﬁrst approach, we assayed the adhesion of MCF7 cells
on Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells Dermal Lymphatic-
Neonatal (HMVEC-dLyNeo) and Human Microvascular En-
dothelial Cells Lung Lymphatic (HMVEC-LLy). As shown in
Figure 6A, MCF7 cells displayed comparable levels of adhesion
to dermal and lung LECs. A higher, even if not signiﬁcant, adhe-
sion to HMVEC-LLy was observed and for this reason they were
used for the subsequent experiments. To assess the involvement
of Tn antigen in this interaction, we performed MCF7 adhe-
sion assays in the presence of mAb 2154F12A4 and an isotype
control antibody (IgM). Interestingly, mAb 2154F12A4 signiﬁ-
cantly (P = 0.002) inhibited breast cancer cell adhesion to LECs
up the 30% (Figure 6B), demonstrating that this oligosaccharidic
antigen is implicated in the cancer cell lymphatic endothelium
interaction, and thus it is a potential molecular player in the
process of lymph node metastasis.

Discussion

Tn is expressed by 90% of human carcinomas (Springer 1997)
and has been proposed as diagnostic and prognostic tumor
biomarker for breast carcinoma (Kumar et al. 2005). Despite its
importance, the functional role of Tn has not been established
yet, probably because of the lack of appropriate experimental
tools. Here, we report the generation of a speciﬁc mouse mAb
against Tn (2154F12A4) obtained by using novel conjugated Tn
compounds. Importantly, when injected in MCF7-tumor bearing
mice 2154F12A4 speciﬁcally bound to primary tumor lesions
as well as to metastatic lymph nodes. Moreover, it was able to
inhibit cancer cell adhesion to lymphatic endothelium, unveiling
a new molecular function of this widespread tumor marker.

A number of anti-Tn antibodies have been already generated
by using mucins puriﬁed from cancer cell culture supernatant
(Takahashi et al. 1988; Numata et al. 1990; Ando et al. 2008),
asialo ovine sumaxillar mucin, (Kjeldsen et al. 1988; O’Boyle
and Wright 1994), tumor extracts (Nuti et al. 1982; Hirohashi
et al. 1985; Siddiki et al. 1993), and synthetic Tn conjugated
with different molecular scaffolds such as KLH (keyhole limpet
hemocyanine; O’Boyle et al. 1996; Reddish et al. 1997). Our
approach differs from the previous ones since we used a puri-
ﬁed synthetic Tn antigen in all the steps of mAb selection. In
detail, a synthetic Tn conjugated to cBSA was used as immuno-
gen, whereas a synthetic Tn conjugated to biotinylated-alginate
was used to deﬁne the speciﬁcity of anti-Tn antibodies. For
the preparation of the samples, we explored a new conjuga-
tion strategy. Kuduk and co-workers (1998) reported an elegant
procedure for the preparation of a synthetic vaccine obtained
by conjugating a glycopeptide containing the Tn or TF mo-
tive with KLH, through a linker. This method provided a high
density of Tn on the glycopeptidic side-chain of the protein.
Differently, we succeeded in directly clusterizing Tn on the
immunogenic protein in a more convenient single step proce-
dure. Our approach did not necessitate the pre-clusterization of
Tn on a short peptide, or the use of a linker such as mercap-
toacetamide or tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteinylserine, and the
subsequent protection–deprotection steps. We synthesized only
the core of the recognized motif, namely N-acetylgalactosamine

alpha linked to the amminoacid serine. Since Tn is not immuno-
genic, it must be linked to a carrier molecule (biotin or a poly-
meric chain); we decided to leave the functional groups of the
aminoacidic moiety unprotected for the following conjugation
step. Thus, in its ﬁnal form, the glycoconjugate has always been
a functional group (amino or carboxylic) that is involved in an

amidic bond (mimicking the native structure) while the other is
free. This approach provided high clusterization efﬁcacy able
to generate a considerable mouse immune response against the
target antigen.

Our principal aim was to produce a mAb for in vivo
imaging and the puriﬁed oligosaccaridic antigen assured us the

successful selection of highly speciﬁc mAbs. mAb 215F12A4
(IgM) in vitro selectively recognized Tn on the MCF7 surface,
since its binding to cell membrane was completely abolished
by preincubation with puriﬁed Tn. Importantly, QDot 800-
conjugated 2154F12A4 was able to speciﬁcally detect MCF7
primary tumors and their lymph node metastases in nude
mice. As expected, the signal emitted by the tumor cell-bound
antibody was correlated to the extent of metastasis, as conﬁrmed

by the ex vivo acquisition data. The subsequent immunohisto-
chemical cytokeratin staining conﬁrmed that a larger number of
MCF7 tumor cells corresponded to higher ﬂuorescence signal.
Altogether, these results support the speciﬁcity and selectivity
of mAb 2154F12A4 in binding Tn in vivo. Accordingly, 72 h
from mAb injection, a negligible signal was observed in organs
such as lung, liver, kidney, and spleen. It is interesting to note
that the present in vivo signals were obtained with soluble

been shown in different studies to adhere to LECs (Irjala et al.
2003; Kawai et al. 2009), there is no direct experimental ev-
idence to date demonstrating that adhesive interactions with
LECs are indeed required for tumor cell entry into the lym-
phatics (Das and Skobe 2008). However, the active role of Tn
played in lymphatic metastasis is strongly supported by clini-
cal data evidencing that lymphatic metastasis is related to the
expression of simple mucin-type carbohydrates such as Tn and
Tn-like antigens (Kawaguchi et al. 2006). These present novel
results directly demonstrate the involvement of Tn in the tumor
cell–LEC interaction and suggest its functional role in lym-
phatic metastasis. Further studies will be addressed to assess if
mAb 2154F12A4 will prevent or reduce cancer cell spread to
lymph nodes in vivo, building the basis for a new approach for
lymphatic metastasis treatment.

Material and methods

Alginate biotinylation
Alginate was modiﬁed through the introduction of a biotin
derivative, (N-(+)-biotinyl-L-lysine-hydrazide), which is much
more water soluble than biotin and has amino groups capa-
ble to react with the carboxylic functions on the polymer.
Alginate, isolated from Laminaria hyperborea, was provided
by Protan A/S (Norway) and puriﬁed by precipitation in iso-
propanol. For the biotinylation, 30 mg (0.15 mmol – repet-
itive unit) of alginate was dissolved in 10 mL of 0.2 M 2-
morpholinoethanesulphonic acid buffer (MES, Fluka, Buchs,
Switzerland) at pH 6. After solubilization, 72 mg of 1,1-
ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (EDC, Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 8.5 mg of N-hydroxy-succinimide
(NHS, Sigma-Aldrich) were added and, after 10 min, 3.2 mg of
Nε-(+)-biotinyl-L-lysinehydrazide (Fluka) was further added.
The solution was stirred for 6–8 h, and then dialyzed and
freeze-dried.

Tn-biotinylation
4.0 mg (0.016 mmol) of biotin was dissolved in 2.5 mL of
0.2 M MES buffer at pH 6.0. 7.64 mg of EDC and 1.0 mg
of NHS were dissolved in 0.5 mL of the same buffer and af-
ter few minutes added to the solution. After 10 min, 1.0 mg
(0.0032 mmol) of GalNAcα-O-Ser was added and the solution
was stirred overnight. The product was puriﬁed with HPLC-UV.
The yield was equal to 89%.

Clusterization of Tn
Fourteen milligrams (0.071 mmol) of biotinylated alginate was
dissolved in 5.0 mL of 0.2 M MES buffer, pH 6.0. After solu-
bilization, EDC (33.9 mg) and NHS (4.7 mg) were added and,
after 10 min, 0.6 mg (1.95 × 10
−3 mmol, 0.027 eq.) of GalNAc-
α-O-Ser was further added. The solution was stirred for 8 h,
dialyzed, and freeze-dried. Elemental analysis gives a molar de-
gree of substitution of Tn-Alg equal to 30%. Cationized BSA
(cBSA) was prepared according to the procedure reported by
Domen et al. (1987); the number of amino groups was equal to
the number of native amino residues of BSA plus the number of
carboxylic groups (glutamate and aspartate) which were deriva-
tized with ethylenediamine. GalNAc-α-O-Ser (1 mg) and cBSA
(2 mg) were dissolved in a solution containing the MES buffer

mAb 2154F12A4; however, we are aware that high-quality
mAb-targeted tumor imaging in mice bearing human xenografts
is quite different from what may be achieved clinically. In
view of a translational application of mAb 2154F12A4 as a
diagnostic and therapeutic tool, we are trying to ameliorate the
sensitivity for detecting as small as possible cancer lesions by

delivery system such as a suitable polymeric scaffold.

Lymph node metastasis is a major complication associated
with many carcinomas, in particular with breast carcinoma
(Achen and Stacker 2008). A broad array of adhesion molecules,
such as carbohydrates, lectins, selectins, cadherins, integrins,
have been implicated in the adhesion of tumor cells to the BECs
(Miles et al. 2008). Much less is known about the mechanism
and the molecules involved in tumor cells adhesion to LECs.
Cell surface carbohydrate structures may indeed play a role in
the dissemination of cancer cells to the draining as well as dis-
tal lymph nodes. The selective spread of MCF7 breast cancer
cells to the lymph nodes that was evidenced by in vivo imaging
after the injection of the labeled mAb 2154F12A4 in tumor-
bearing mice suggested that Tn may be directly involved in the
process of lymphatic metastasis. This hypothesis was supported
also by a previous study demonstrating that the expression of
Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA)-binding carbohydrates, such as
Tn, correlates with tumor stage, lymphatic invasion, and lymph
node metastasis (Kawaguchi et al. 2006). In the present investi-
gation, we showed that MCF7 cells adhered to the same extent to
LECs isolated from human derma or lung and mAb 2154F12A4
partially interfered with this static adhesion. Similarly to the
interaction of galectin-3 and TF that occurs in BEC-cancer cell
adhesion (Khaldoyanidi et al. 2003), it is tempting to speculate
that galectin-8, recently described to play a role in LECs func-
tion (Cueni and Detmar 2009), could be the counter-receptor of
Tn and this pair could represent a possible target for an anti-
metastatic activity of mAb 2154F12A4. While tumor cells have

(0.2 M), pH 6; EDC and NHS were added, and the mixture was
stirred for 2 h. The solution was then dialyzed and freeze-dried.
The molar degree of substitution was evaluated by enzymatic
hydrolysis of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) deriving from
Tn using α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from Acremonium spp.
(Seikagaku Tokyo, Japan; 50 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 37
C,
2.5 h) and subsequent evaluation of the amount of GalNAc by
capillary electrophoresis. The molar degree of substitution of
Tn-cBSA was equal to 3%.

◦

Capillary electrophoresis
The high-performance capillary electrophoresis system was
from Hewlett-Packard (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany), Model
HP3DCE, with HP Chemstation software. Derivatization of
GalNAc, either standard (Sigma-Aldrich) or arising from hy-
drolysis of Tn-cBSA, with 2-aminobenzoic acid (2-AA) was
carried out by mixing an aqueous solution of the sugar with
the derivatizing solution (0.25 M 2-AA, 0.159 M sodium
cyanoborohydride in 99% methanol and 1% acetic acid). The so-
◦
lution was heated at 60
C for 5 h. Before capillary electrophore-
sis analysis, the samples were diluted ﬁve times in water. Before
each run, the fused silica capillary (56 cm total length, 50 μm
i.d.) was washed with sodium hydroxide (2 min, 985 mbar) and
with 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 3.0 (4 min, 985 mbar).

HPLC-MS
Instrument: HPLC SURVEYOR Thermo Finnigan system
equipped with MS Pump, Autosampler and PDA Detector,
coupled with a LCQ DECA XP Plus Thermo Finnigan mass
spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI). The Xcalibur
software was used for managing system and data. HPLC-MS
experimental conditions were the following: a Synergi Polar –
RP 80A column (2.0 × 250 mm; 4 μm) from Phenomenex was
◦
C at a ﬂow rate of 200 μL/min and a run time of
used at 45
45 min with a PDA detector. Detection with an MS detector
was performed with a run time of 45 min and capillary tem-
◦
perature of 250
C and a mass range of 50–2000. HPLC-UV
Merck-Hitachi equipped with a L-6200. Pump, an AS-200A
Autosampler, and a L-4500A Diode Array Detector was used
for UV analysis with a run time of 30 min. Data acquisition
and analysis were performed by D-700 Chromatography Data
Station software (Merck-Hitachi).

Production of mouse monoclonal antibodies
Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted
according to the institutional guidelines in compliance with na-
◦
tional laws (D.Lgs. n
116/92). Anti-Tn mAbs were produced
according to a modiﬁed version of the protocol previously de-
scribed by Galfre et al. (1977). Brieﬂy, 8-week-old female
BALB/c mice (Harlan Italy S.r.L., Udine, Italy) were immu-
nized by intraperitoneal injections of 200 μg of Tn-cBSA and
properly emulsiﬁed in Ribi’s (MPL R(cid:2) + TDM Adjuvant Sys-
tem; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Injection was done once a
week for 3 weeks, and after 1 month, the mice were boosted by
three daily additional intravenous injections of 20 μg of anti-
gen properly diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Cam-
brex Bio Science; Verviers, Belgium). The animals were then
sacriﬁced, and spleen cells were fused with mouse myeloma
NS1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC; Manas-
sas, VA). Hybrid cells were grown in 4.5 g/L glucose modi-

1064

ﬁed Dulbecco’s medium (DMEM; Lonza Milano S.r.l., Milan,
Italy) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS; Lonza
Milano S.r.l.), and then selected in Hypoxanthine Aminopterin
Thymidine medium (HAT; Sigma). The resulting hybridoma
clones were then grown in DMEM with 20% FCS and further
subcloned. The isotype characterization and the puriﬁcation of
the antibodies were performed following the manufacturer’s
procedures of Mouse MonoAB ID KIT (Zymed Laboratories,
Inc.; San Francisco, CA) and HiTrap IgM Puriﬁcation HP (GE
Healthcare Italia, Milan, Italy), respectively.

Immobilized-antigen enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay
Mouse serum and hybridoma supernatants were screened for
the presence of speciﬁc anti-Tn mAbs with the following pro-
cedure. To immobilize the antigen to a solid phase, microtiter
plate wells were coated with 10 μg/mL streptavidin (Sigma-
Aldrich) in the carbonate buffer 100 mM, pH 9.6, overnight at
◦
C; 100 μg/mL of Tn-biotinylated alginate conjugate was then
4
added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37
C. 1% ovalbu-
min (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h at 37
C was used to block
unspeciﬁc sites; then, mouse serum or hybridoma supernatants
were added for 2 h at 37
C followed by a polyvalent anti-mouse
IgG-, IgA-, and IgM-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
◦
(MP Biomedicals; Aurora, OH) for 1 h at 37
C. The antibody
(cid:4)
binding was visualized by 1 mg/mL of 2,2
-azino-bis-3-ethyl-
benzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) peroxidase substrate
(Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in the 100 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.5.
Absorbance was measured at 405 nm by a computer-interfaced
GENios Plus microplate reader (TECAN Italia S.r.l., Milan,
Italy).

◦

◦

◦

Cell surface ELISA
The selected subclones were assayed by ELISA on the Tn-
expressing mammary carcinoma cell line, MCF7 provided by
ATCC and maintained in DMEM (Lonza Milano S.r.l) sup-
plemented with antibiotics, 20% FCS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate
(Sigma), 2 mg/mL glutamine (Sigma), 0.1 mM non-essential
aminoacids (Sigma), 10 μg/mL insulin (Humulin R, Eli Lilly,
Italy). Brieﬂy, cells were grown in a 96-well plate for 3–5 days
until conﬂuence and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in
PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After blocking with 1%
ovalbumin in PBS for 1 h at 37
C and incubating the hybridoma
supernatants for 2 h at 37
C, the binding of the speciﬁc mAbs
against Tn antigen was detected with a goat anti-mouse IgM-
HRP-conjugated antibody (MP Biomedicals). The colorimetric
reaction developed with the ABTS substrate was measured spec-
trophotometrically at 405 nm by a computer-interfaced GENios
Plus microplate reader (TECAN Italia S.r.L.).

◦

◦

Solid-phase preclearing
To evaluate the speciﬁcity of the subclones to the MCF7-
expressed Tn antigen, a solid-phase preclearing test was
performed. Brieﬂy, microtiter plate wells were coated with
10 μg/mL of streptavidin (Sigma-Aldrich) in the carbonate
buffer 100 mM, pH 9.6, overnight at 4
C; serial dilutions of
Tn-biotinylated alginate conjugate were added to the wells and
◦
incubated for 1 h at 37
C. After blocking with 1% ovalbumin
(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h at 37
C, mAbs were added for
◦
2 h at 37
C. The precleared supernatants were subsequently

◦

◦

collected and tested on MCF7 cells following the cell surface
ELISA procedure.

Immunoﬂuorescence staining
MCF7 cells were grown on acid-washed coverslips for 3 days,
ﬁxed in PBS 4% PFA for 15 min, and blocked with 2% goat
◦
serum and 1% ovalbumin in PBS for 1 h at 37
C. The cells
were then incubated with hybridoma supernatants for 2 h at
C and further with the anti IgM-Alexa Fluor R(cid:2)
◦
37
488 (Molec-
ular Probes, Eugene, OR) secondary antibody. After extensive
washes, coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4–88 (Calbiochem-
Novabiochem) containing 2.5% (w/v) DABCO (Sigma). Images
were acquired with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal system (Leica Mi-
crosystems Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany) using the Leica
Confocal Software (LCS).

Immunohistochemistry
Mouse tissues were excised, embedded in OCT (Kaltek, Padova,
Italy), snap-frozen and stored at −80
◦
C. Cryostat sections of
7 μm were air-dried at room temperature and kept at −80
◦
C
wrapped in aluminum foils. Before using, the sections were
equilibrated at room temperature, hydrated, and permeabilized
with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. After inactivation of
endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% of hydrogen peroxide,
tissue sections were ﬁxed with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min and
saturated with the blocking buffer (PBS, 1% BSA and 2% FCS)
for 30 min. The rabbit anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (DakoCy-
tomation, CA) was then added at room temperature for 1 h,
followed by three 5 min washes in PBS. Tissue sections were
then incubated with the anti-rabbit-peroxidase-conjugated sec-
ondary antibody for 1 h. The enzymatic reaction was developed
with diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector Laboratories, Inc, CA),
and nuclei were visualized with Mayer Hemallume (Kaltek srl,
Padova, Italy) staining. Images were acquired with a camera
equipped microscope (Leica Microsystems).

In vivo imaging
8-week-old female nude mice (Harlan Italy S.r.L) were injected
subcutaneously in the right ﬂank and in the mammary fat pad
with 5 × 106 MCF7 cells resuspended in 100 μL of PBS. Hun-
dred micrograms of 17 β-estradiol (Sigma) diluted in sesame
oil (Sigma) was weekly subcutaneously administered to stim-
ulate cell growth in vivo. All tumors were allowed to grow to
approximately 5–7 mm in diameter before imaging studies were
performed. The hybridoma clone that demonstrated the highest
reactivity against Tn antigen (clone 2154F12A4) was puriﬁed
and conjugated with QDot 800 according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Molecular Probes). Fifty micrograms of the la-
beled antibody was injected into the tail vein of anesthetized
tumor-bearing mice, and the ﬂuorescent images were recorded
by IVIS Lumina Imaging System (Xenogen Corporation, CA).

Tumor cell adhesion to LECs
HMVEC-dLyNeo or HMVEC-LLy (Lonza Milano S.r.l.) were
seeded in a 96-well plate and grown in EGM-2 MV (Lonza
Milano S.r.l.) for 3 days until conﬂuence. MCF7 cells were
detached with 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
labeled with the vital ﬂuorochrome calcein AM
in PBS,
◦
(Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37
C, resuspended in PBS
with the addition of 1 mM CaCl2 and MgCl2 and incubated

Tn antigen in the cancer cell–lymphatic endothelium interaction

with 10 μg/mL of anti-Tn antigen mAb (clone 2154F12A4) or
with the isotype control antibody (IgM, Sigma) for 20 min at
C. 1 × 105 MCF7 per well were seeded into the LEC-coated
◦
37
◦
plates and incubated for 30 min at 37
C. Unbound cells were
removed by three washes with PBS, and cancer cell adhesion to
lymphatic endothelium was quantiﬁed by a computer-interfaced
GENios Plus microplate reader (TECAN Italia S.r.L.).

Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance of the results was determined by using
the unpaired Student’s t-test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.
