Biofuels are anticipated to enable a shift from fossil fuels for renewable transportation
and manufacturing fuels, with biohydrogen considered attractive since it could offer the
largest reduction of global carbon budgets. Currently, lignocellulosic biohydrogen produc-
tion remains inefﬁcient with pretreatments that are heavily fossil fuel-dependent. However,
bacteria using alkali-treated biomass could streamline biofuel production while reducing
costs and fossil fuel needs. An alkaliphilic bacterium, Halanaerobium hydrogeniformans, is
described that is capable of biohydrogen production at levels rivaling neutrophilic strains,
but at pH 11 and hypersaline conditions. H. hydrogeniformans ferments a variety of 5- and
6-carbon sugars derived from hemicellulose and cellulose including cellobiose, and forms
the end products hydrogen, acetate, and formate. Further, it can also produce biohydro-
gen from switchgrass and straw pretreated at temperatures far lower than any previously
reported and in solutions compatible with growth. Hence, this bacterium can potentially
increase the efﬁciency and efﬁcacy of biohydrogen production from renewable biomass
resources.

INTRODUCTION
As the price of fossil fuels increases and reserves diminish, biofuel
production is seen as a viable contribution to current as well as
future energy demands. Hydrogen (H2), alcohol, and hydrocar-
bon generation by microbial fermentation of lignocellulosic plant
materials holds promise as alternatives to petroleum based fuels.
H2 has an advantage in that combustion only results in water vapor,
without the generation of carbon dioxide. Although the potential
exists for microbially generated fuels from biomass to be econom-
ically attractive, several issues are still to be resolved. Of particular
note is the large fossil fuel-dependent energy input of the typical
steam blasting pretreatment of biomass as well as detoxiﬁcation of
the resulting compounds that are inhibitory to fermentation, and
overall low hydrogen yields.

While many technical issues are still to be resolved pertaining
to using H2 as a transportation fuel, particularly devising safe stor-
age methods, the demand for sustainable forms of H2 is great with
regard to industry. Hydrogen gas is currently produced through
the steam reforming of natural gas and coal gasiﬁcation, and is
used in chemical production, oil reﬁning, and steel manufactur-
ing. The vast majority of global H2 production is by industrial
consumers, with individual H2 production facilities meeting the
demands of their manufacturing processes (Mueller-Langer et al.,
2007). As the price of natural gas continues to increase, demand
is likely to increase for an economically and environmentally

sustainable means of H2 production that can ﬁt into the current
on-site production model. The further development of biological
H2 generation derived from plant biomass could be used to meet
the demands of these industries while decreasing their reliance on
fossil fuels.

Fibrous plant material is made up of lignocellulose and prin-
cipally contains cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose is
comprised of linear chains of the sugar glucose and is mostly crys-
talline; whereas, hemicellulose is more amorphous, being made
up of both pentoses and hexoses, and is more readily hydrolyzed
(Updegraff, 1969). Lignin has a poorly deﬁned, heterologous
structure providing strength and support to plant structure (Lebo
et al., 2001) but is recalcitrant to bacterial degradation. It is due to
lignins recalcitrance that pretreatments are required to facilitate
its removal. Currently, the most common pretreatment method
is steam blasting that causes the solid cellulose to become sepa-
rated from the aqueous hemicellulose and lignin. However, this
treatment requires electricity for steam generation and is typi-
cally a natural gas- or coal-dependent step (Datar et al., 2007;
Liu et al., 2002). Hence, considerable amounts of CO2 are emit-
ted and the production of biofuels remains fossil fuel-dependent.
Under these conditions, a host of compounds that are inhibitory to
fermentation are generated from lignin degradation and include
weak acids, furan derivatives, and phenolic compounds (Palmqvist
and Hahn-Hägerdal, 2000b). Before microbial fermentation of

hemicellulose can occur, these inhibitors must be separated and
removed from the liquid fraction. Current detoxiﬁcation meth-
ods include enzyme treatment, fractionation of volatile com-
pounds, and chemical treatment. However, alkali treatment is
the most effective method of precipitating toxins and destabiliz-
ing inhibitors (Palmqvist and Hahn-Hägerdal, 2000a). Overall,
the current processes of pretreatment, detoxiﬁcation, and sub-
sequent fermentation are relatively inefﬁcient and remain fossil
fuel-dependent, thus counterproductive to the goal of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions.

An effective alternative is alkali treatment of the lignocellu-
lose. This pretreatment separates cellulose from the hemicellulose
and lignin, reduces the crystallinity of the cellulose making it
more accessible for degradation and fermentation, and limits
the production of inhibitory compounds (Gáspár et al., 2007;
Jackson, 1977; Spencer and Akin, 1980). However, the resulting
substrates are highly alkaline and potentially have a high concen-
tration of salts. Previously, alkali treatment was evaluated against
several others, including steam blasting, for bioethanol produc-
tion from a number of biomass substrates. The results indicated
that alkali treatment was the most efﬁcient process, producing at
least 3.5 times higher ethanol yields compared to steam-blasted
or acid-treated biomass (Klinke et al., 2004). Hence, a fermenta-
tive haloalkaliphilic bacterium with naturally high H2 yields may
decrease the number of production steps for biofuel production.
The application of such an organism would eliminate the need
for steam blasting of biomass. The need for removal of inhibitory
compounds would also be eliminated in addition to the pH neu-
tralization step prior to sugar fermentation. Hence, a fermentative
haloalkaliphile offers a potentially more efﬁcient and cost-effective
adaptation for biohydrogen production.

The current study describes the isolation and characteriza-
tion of such an organism, Halanaerobium hydrogeniformans, from
Soap Lake, WA along with the development of a modiﬁed, alka-
line pretreatment of lignocellulosic material that foregoes many of
the existing pretreatment issues. H. hydrogeniformans was tested
for the capacity to grow and produce biohydrogen on several
5- and 6-carbon sugars as well as with alkaline pretreated straw
and switchgrass in batch and fed-batch bioreactors to assess the
feasibility of haloalkaliphilic biohydrogen production.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STRAIN ISOLATION
Highly enriched liquid cultures that resulted from lake sedi-
ment slurries were plated on medium containing 1.25% (wt/vol)
agar in order to isolate single colonies to attain a pure cul-
ture. The culture medium included (per liter): 70 g NaCl, 40 g
Na2CO3, 6.3 g K2HPO4, 1 g yeast extract, 0.75 g Na2S (as a reduc-
tant), 0.6 g cysteine (as a reductant), along with 10 mL of basal
medium stock solution and 10 mL of trace mineral solution.
The basal medium stock solution included (per liter): 50 mg
NH4NO3, 8.5 mg MgCl2·6H2O, 7.5 mg SiO2, 4.5 mg MnSO4·H2O,
4.2 mg CaCl2·2H2O, 4 mg methylene blue (as an oxygen indica-
tor), and 1.8 mg FeSO4·7H2O. The trace mineral solution included
(per liter): 3 g MgSO4·7H20, 1.63 g Na3-NTA, 1 g NaCl, 0.64 g
MnCl2·4H2O, 0.13 g ZnCl2, 0.1 g FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g CaCl2·2H2O,
CoCl2·6H2O, 0.03 g NiSO4·6H2O, 0.025 g Na2MoO4·2H2O,

0.025 g Na2WO4·2H2O, 0.01 g AlK(SO4)2·12H2O, 0.01 g H3BO3,
and 7 mg CuCl2·2H2O.

All plates and colony manipulations were carried out in an
anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products Inc, Grass Lake,
MI) under an atmosphere of ∼95% N2/5% H2. Due to high pH
and NaCl concentrations, the plating medium was made by mixing
two-fold concentrated solutions of sterile medium with a two-fold
solution of sterile, molten agar in water post-autoclaving to avoid
a blackened slurry precipitate. Sterile solutions of separate car-
bon sources, Na2S, and cysteine were also added post-autoclaving.
Cells and cell dilutions of liquid cultures, grown to an optical
density of ∼0.3, were aliquoted (1 mL) into empty, sterile plas-
tic plates that had been equilibrated in the anaerobic chamber
for at least 5 days. Molten medium (50˚C) was poured over the
cells, swirled, and allowed to solidify (Bender et al., 2007). The
plates were then incubated in the anaerobic chamber at 33˚C
and single colonies were visible after ∼ 2 weeks. Colonies were
extracted from agar with a sterile toothpick and inoculated into
2.5 mL of sterile liquid medium as described above. Once grown,
the cultures were checked for consistent cell morphology via
phase contrast microscopy. One culture was selected and inoc-
ulated into 100 mL of sterile medium as above, and used to make
frozen glycerol stock cultures. One milliliter of culture was com-
bined with 100 μL of autoclaved and anaerobic glycerol for a ﬁnal
concentration of 10% (v/v) glycerol and was performed in the
anaerobic glove bag. The resulting culture has been deposited
at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) under ATCC
Patent Deposit Designation PTA-10410 and under U. S. Patent
8,034,592.

16S rRNA GENE SEQUENCE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS
Genomic DNA was isolated from frozen cell pellets. The cell
pellet was thawed and resuspended in sterile deionized H2O
(300 μL) with gentle pipeting, then boiled (10 min), and cen-
trifuged (13,000× g; 3 min, RT). Genomic DNA was puriﬁed with
the Wizard DNA puriﬁcation kit (Promega, Madison, WI; Bender
et al., 2007). One microliter of the supernatant containing puriﬁed
gDNA was used for 16S rRNA gene ampliﬁcation with universal
bacterial primers 27F (5
) and
1492R (5
) as well as the univer-
(cid:2)
sal archeal primers 21F (5
)
and 23SaRev (5
; Dimitriu et al.,
2008; Dimitriu et al., 2005), as previously described (Bender et al.,
2007). PCR products were obtained for the bacterial, but not for
the archeal, PCR reactions. The resultant bacterial PCR prod-
ucts were sequenced by the University of Missouri DNA Core
Facility1. The sequence was analyzed by BLAST analysis2 using
the nucleotide collection and highly similar sequence (Megablast)
settings. The identiﬁcation of phylogenetic neighbors was initially
carried out by the BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) and MegaBLAST
(Zhang et al., 2000) programs against the database of type strains
of valid prokaryotic names (Chun et al., 2007). Sixteen sequences
with the highest scores were then selected for the calculation
of pairwise sequence similarity by using the global alignment

The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate and those of the clos-
est type strains were aligned by using the NAST alignment function
of Greengenes (DeSantis et al., 2006) and edited and trimmed
by using Jalview (Clamp et al., 2004; Waterhouse et al., 2009). A
Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree was generated by using the
MEGA4 program (Tamura et al., 2007). The sequence data have
been submitted to GenBank with accession number GQ215697.

SERUM BOTTLE AND TUBE CULTIVATION GROWTH CONDITIONS
Cultures were grown under anaerobic conditions in 28 mL
Balch/Hungate tubes with a liquid volume of 5 mL (Balch and
Wolfe, 1976) capped with blue butyl rubber stoppers, crimp sealed
with aluminum seals, and gassed with 80% N2/20% CO2 as
previously described (Elias et al., 2004). The empty tubes were
degassed and autoclaved (121˚C, 20 min). Once the tubes cooled,
the medium was added via ﬁlter sterilization using 0.2 μm syringe
ﬁlters so as to avoid the precipitation that occurs with autoclaving.
Stock solutions of the carbon sources cellobiose, glucose, man-
nose, ribose, galactose, arabinose, and xylose were prepared sepa-
rately, ﬁlter-sterilized into the sterile culture tubes through 0.2 μm
pore size syringe ﬁlters, and used at a ﬁnal concentration of 30 mM
except for cellobiose at 15 mM. Negative control cultures had no
carbon source other than the 0.1% (w/v) yeast extract. All medium
components and sugars were purchased from either Sigma Life Sci-
ence (St. Louis, MO) or Fisher Scientiﬁc (Pittsburg, PA). Culture
volumes totaled 5 mL including a 10% (v/v) inoculation. Cultures
were grown in triplicate in the dark at 30˚C. Growth was fol-
lowed by optical density as well as by protein quantiﬁcation for
liquid cultures when pure sugars were used as the carbon source.
Experiments involving straw and switchgrass used only protein
quantiﬁcation for the determination of growth.

Protein was quantiﬁed using a modiﬁed Bradford assay (Brad-
ford, 1976) where the culture samples at pH ∼10.5 (0.3 mL)
were centrifuged (13,000× g; 5 min; RT) and the supernatant
discarded. The pellet was resuspended in deionized and ﬁlter-
sterilized (0.22 μm pore size) H2O to the original 0.3 mL volume
and frozen (−20˚C) until analyzed. The samples were thawed and
amended with 0.1 mL of 5N NaOH, heated (80˚C; 30 min), cooled,
and then added to the Bradford solution (4 mL) as previously
described (Bradford, 1976).

Hydrogen was quantiﬁed on a gas chromatogram (Varian Inc,
Palo Alto, CA; model CP-3380) equipped with Varian fused silica
Select Permanent Gas/CO2 HR column (CP-7430) operating at
30˚C, and a thermal conductivity detector at 175˚C. The carrier
gas was N2 at 14 psi, and samples were analyzed by using the
Star Chromatography Workstation Version 5.50 software (Var-
ian, Inc.). Injection volumes were 50 μL with the injection port
temperature at 50˚C.

The loss of sugars and appearance of organic acids were
followed over time with high pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC; Shimadzu, Inc., Columbia, MD, USA) equipped with an
Aminex HPX-87H ion exculsion column (125-0140; Phenomenex

www.frontiersin.org

Inc, Torrance, CA) and a column oven (Shimadzu CTO-20A) set
at 53˚C. Both a refractive index (RI) detector (Shimadzu RID-
10A) and UV/VIS detector (Shimadzu SPD-20A) were employed.
Injection volumes for HPLC, 10 μL, were accomplished with an
autosampler (Shimadzu SIL-10AF) and system controller (Shi-
madzu SCC-10A). The mobile phase for all detections was N2
degassed 30 mM H2SO4 under isocratic ﬂow (Shimadzu DGU-
20A3) pumped (Shimadzu LC-10Ai) at 22 mL/min. All data from
triplicate analyses were analyzed by using Shimadzu LC Solutions
Version 1.2.

SERUM BOTTLE BIOHYDROGEN PRODUCTION FROM SWITCHGRASS
AND STRAW
Switchgrass was obtained from the Bradford Farm at the University
of Missouri and dried. The straw was purchased from a retail outlet
and was already dried. Both were pulverized and passed through
a 1 mm screen. The resulting lignocellulose that passed through
the screen was weighed out in 0.4 g aliquots and placed in 120 mL
pyrex serum bottles to which 20 mL of 40 g/L Na2CO3 was added
to maintain the concentration of 20 g/L of lignocellulose as previ-
ously described (Bjerre et al., 1996). The bottles were then sealed
with blue butyl rubber stoppers and held in place with crimp seals
as previously described (Elias et al., 2004). Duplicate bottles were
then subjected to pretreatment temperatures of room temperature
(12 h), 55˚C (2 h), 75˚C (2 h), 90˚C (1 h), 130˚C (15 min), 150˚C
(15 min), and 170˚C (15 min) in a conventional oven. Each of the
pretreated samples were allowed to cool and then transferred to
50 mL falcon tubes and centrifuged (12 min; 27,000× g; RT).

The supernatant and the insoluble slurry material were sepa-
rated for determination of their respective capacities to support
growth and biohydrogen production with the isolate. The super-
natant was taken as the lignocellulosic liquor that presumably
contained sugars resulting from hemicellulose (Bjerre et al., 1996;
Klinke et al., 2004) and was transferred to serum bottles, sealed
with blue butyl stoppers as above and degassed with N2. Sterile
and anaerobic (80% N2/20% CO2) Hungate tubes received 1 mL
of ﬁltered 5× concentrated medium solution as described above
without any carbon or electron source as well as 3.5 mL of the
degassed lignocellulosic liquor. The resulting 4.5 mL solution was
reduced with cysteine and sulﬁde as described above and then
received 0.5 mL of a freshly grown culture of the isolate. The cul-
ture tubes were then incubated at 33˚C with shaking (250 rpm).
Before distribution to the Hungate tubes, samples (1 mL) were
taken for sugar and organic acid analysis as well as for protein
quantiﬁcation (0.3 mL) as described above. Similar samples were
taken at the end of the cultivation and the production of H2 was
followed periodically as described above.

The solid material slurry was presumed to contain primarily
cellulose (Bjerre et al., 1996; Klinke et al., 2004). In order to avoid
the concentration of salts during drying, the slurry was washed
twice with 20 mL of deionized and ﬁlter-sterilized water (20 mL)
via centrifugation (12 min; 27,000× g; RT). The washed slurry was
placed in pre-weighed plastic weigh-boats and dried at 80˚C (2 h)
(Bjerre et al., 1996), and weighed again when dry. Sterile Hungate
tubes received 0.2 g of the dried solid material, sealed, crimped,
and degassed as above. Each tube then received 4.5 mL of ﬁlter-
sterilized medium with no carbon or electron source followed by

0.5 mL of a freshly grown culture of the isolate. Immediately after
inoculation, a replicate set of tubes was sacriﬁced to obtain sam-
ples of organic acids (1 mL) as well as for protein quantiﬁcation
(0.3 mL) as described above. At the end of the cultivation, sim-
ilar samples were taken, and the production of H2 was followed
periodically as described above.

BIOREACTOR CULTIVATION, GROWTH CONDITIONS AND
BIOHYDROGEN PRODUCTION
Bioreactor studies were carried out using a Biostat BPlus sys-
tem (Sartorius Stedim, Bohemia, NY) bioreactor with a 3 L vessel
and a 2 L working volume. Throughout all bioreactor cultivations,
Halanaerobium hydrogenoformans’ H2 productivity was measured
with the substrates glucose, cellobiose and switchgrass hydrolyzate
substrates (see below for preparation). As with serum bottle culti-
vation, the bioreactor was autoclaved empty (121˚C, 45 min) and
then ﬁlled with ﬁlter-sterilized growth media as described above
until the desired volume was reached. System parameters were set
(33ºC, pH= 11.0, agitation= 750 rpm) using the DCU-2 control
unit (Sartorius Stedim, Bohemia, NY) and the sterile medium was
sparged (N2, 30 mL/min) until anaerobic conditions were achieved
as evidenced by the methylene blue indicator turning colorless.
The N2 mass ﬂow through the headspace was set at 30 ml/min and
maintained by the ﬂow controller of the DCU-2. Once stabilized,
fresh inoculum (60 ml) was injected into the system using aseptic
and anaerobic techniques.

Throughout the fed-batch controlled cultivation, a Trace Ana-
lytical ta3000R (Ametek, Pittsburgh, PA) reducing gas detector
measured (H2) in the exit gas stream (every 3.5 min). Gas compo-
nents were separated by chromatography before entering a heated,
mercuric oxide bed, and photometric detector. Reducing gases,
including molecular H2, reacted stoichiometrically with the mer-
curic oxide releasing Hg2+
into the ﬂowing carrier gas stream,
and photometric detection was measured by UV absorption of
Hg2+
. The lower detection limit of the unit is 25 ppb H2 with
an accuracy of 10% of reading. Culture samples were obtained
using a ceramic ﬁlter (Flownamics, Madison, WI) every 2 h. Sug-
ars and organic acids were analyzed using high performance liquid
chromatography [HPLC; HP1090 running Chemstation A.03 soft-
ware (Agilent, Santa Clara, Ca)] with a Rezex-RHM (Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA) ion exchange analytical column. The mobile phase
was H2SO4 in Milli-Q (18 MΩ) water (0.005N, 0.6 ml/min, 85˚C)
which passed through a UV–VIS diode-array detector for quanti-
fying organic acids (cut-off absorbance at 210 nm) and a HP 1037
(Agilent, Santa Clara, Ca) RI detector connected in series for quan-
tifying sugars. The injection volume was 10 μL for all samples. Cell
concentration was measured indirectly by monitoring the optical
density of the culture ﬂuid using a Fundulux II (Sartorius Stedim,
Bohemia, NY) probe.

Bioreactor cultivations were performed with 30 mM glucose,
15 mM cellobiose, 150 mM cellobiose, and swithgrass that uti-
lized the haloalkaliphilic pretreatment described in detail here
and above. For glucose and cellobiose, each was added via ﬁl-
ter sterilization with a syringe and needle and the bioreactor was
allowed to stabilize under anaerobic conditions as indicated by a
return to colorless medium. For 30 mM glucose, a 60 mL aliquot
of freshly grown inoculum was added (total volume= 1.8 L) and

the liquid and gas sampling systems started and operated for 80 h.
With 15 mM cellobiose, the same procedure was used and the sys-
tem was operated for 100 h. Using 150 mM cellobiose, the same
starting procedure was used except 100 mL of inoculum was used
and the system was operated for 100 h. At that point, 400 mL was
rapidly pumped from the system. Fresh medium ﬂow began with
15 mM cellobiose (0.3 mL/min) until the culture volume was 2 L
(∼7320 min), and the feed rate stopped for continuation in batch
mode. The total operating time was 240 h. Cultivation with switch-
grass began with milling through a 20 mesh screen. Milled switch-

grass (∼40 g) was placed in 2.0 L NaCO3 (40 g/L, pH= 11.0,)

slowly stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture was
ﬁltered and the supernatant analyzed for sugars by using HPLC as
described above. The ﬁltered hydrolyzate (1320 mL) and 380 mL
5× culture growth medium was added to the bioreactor and stabi-
lized at the operating conditions. Once stabilized, fresh inoculum
(100 mL) was added for a total liquid volume of 1.8 L.

ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
Cells were prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
observation by ﬁxing with 2.5% (v/v) anaerobic glutaraldehyde.
The ﬁxed cells were allowed to sit for approximately 2 h and then
withdrawn by gentle removal of the tube stopper and the liquid,
leaving the ﬁxed cells in a small amount of liquid. The cells were
transferred onto a 0.22 μm pore size nucleopore ﬁlter (shiny side
up). The membrane was positioned on top of a slightly moistened
piece of ﬁlter paper in a small petri dish. Each solution was added to
the ﬁlter paper only until the membrane began to ﬂoat. The sample
was washed with buffer twice (0.1 M cacodylate buffer), followed
by three rinses with ultrapure water and, ﬁnally, an ethanol dehy-
dration series of 10%, 20, 35, & 50% (v/v). A second 0.22 μm
pore size nucleopore ﬁlter was then placed on top of the mem-
brane with the sample and the dehydration continued with 70,
90, 95 and 3× 100% (v/v) ethanol. Following dehydration, the
nucleopore ﬁlters were placed between screens and the sample
was critical-point dried immediately (Tousimis Auto-Samdri; 815
Automatic Critical Point Dryer; Rockville, MD). Following this,
the sandwiched nucleopore membranes were separated, mounted
onto SEM stubs and sputter coated (Emitech K575x Turbo Sputter
Coater; Kent, England) with a thin layer of platinum on a rotating
sample holder (20 kV, 45 s). The coated samples were then viewed
by using a Hitachi S-4700 FESEM (Hitachi High Technologies
America, Inc.; Pleasanton, CA) at a working distance of 5–6 mm,
a voltage of 2.0–10.0 kV, and a magniﬁcation of ∼6000×. All cell
preparations and visualization were conducted at the University
of Missouri Electron Microscopy Core Facility4.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
There is a wide diversity of alkaliphilic bacteria spanning sev-
eral phylogenic groups, most notably from soda lakes (Duckworth
et al., 1996; Jones et al., 1998; Rees et al., 2004); however, their appli-
cation for H2 production has not been investigated. Soap Lake,
Washington, a highly haloalkaline lake, possesses a pH value of 10,
15–140 g/L NaCl, and anaerobic lake bottom sediments with extra-
ordinarily high sulﬁde concentrations (Anderson, 1958; Mormile

et al., 1999; Pinkart et al., 2006; Sorokin et al., 2007; Dimitriu
et al., 2008) making it an ideal location to obtain haloalkaliphilic
bacteria.

Lake bottom sediments were enriched using a culturing
medium (Mormile et al., 1999) that mirrored the geochemistry of
Soap Lake. The culturing medium was modiﬁed to include either
30 mM glucose or 15 mM cellobiose as a carbon source. Subcul-
turing the initial enrichment into the modiﬁed media resulted in
the accumulation of hydrogen gas. Serial dilution plating of the
hydrogen producing mixed culture led to the isolation of a pure
strain of bacteria, designated as strain SL-HP. Strain SL-HP was
grown in the modiﬁed media to conﬁrm the ability to produce
hydrogen from the fermentation of both glucose and cellobiose as
well as characterize its basic physiology.

DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW SPECIES HALANAEROBIUM
HYDROGENIFORMANS
Strain SL-HP was found to be an obligately anaerobic, gram
negative, non-motile, non-sporulating, elongated rod that is
∼18× 1 μm (Figure 1). Growth was observed between 20 and
37˚C, pH 7–12, and NaCl concentrations of 2.5–15% (w/v)
(Table A1 in Appendix). Optimum growth conditions were 30˚C,
pH 11, and 7.5% NaCl. In addition, increased growth was observed
when SL-HP was grown in the presence sodium sulﬁde, even when

pictured here were grown on 15 mM cellobiose in liquid culture under
non-agitated conditions at 30˚C, and pH 11 with 7% (v/v) NaCl. Cells were
ﬁxed with 2.5% (v/v) anaerobic glutaraldehyde, subjected to ethanol
dehydration, critical-point drying, and coated with palladium.

other sources of reductant were present. The optimum sodium
sulﬁde concentration was found to be 0.75 g/L (data not shown).
In the interest of pursuing this bacterium as a potential strain
for industrial biohydrogen production, the ability to ferment a
variety of sugars derived from cellulosic biomass was observed.
SL-HP was able to ferment and produce hydrogen from glucose,
cellobiose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, and galactose. Observed
products of fermentation include acetate, formate, and hydrogen
(Table 1). Due to the high concentration of carbonate and the
alkaline pH of the growth medium, accumulation of CO2 was
not detected in the headspace, but is most likely a product of fer-
mentation. Glucose, ribose, and cellobiose fermentations resulted
in the largest accumulation of biomass, while cellobiose, glucose,
and mannose resulted in the highest levels of hydrogen produc-
tion. In addition to these pentose and hexose sugars, growth was
also observed on glycerol. Growth above control levels was not
observed when acetate, lactate, or ethanol was the added carbon
source.

Phylogenetic analysis clearly placed SL-HP in the Halanaero-
bium genus (Figure 2). The strain’s 16S rRNA gene sequence was
most closely related to H. saccharolyticum subsp. saccharolyticum
(97.4% sequence similarity), H. kushneri (97.4% sequence sim-
ilarity), H. acetethylicum (97.3% sequence similarity), H saccha-
rolyticum subsp. senegalense (97.2% sequence similarity), and H.
praevalens (97.0% sequence similarity). The G + C content of SL-
HP was determined to be 33 mol% through the sequenced genome
(Brown et al., 2011), which is comparable with other members of
the Halanaerobium genus (Supplemental Table 1). Though SL-
HP possesses high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities and G +
C content with the other members of the genus Halanaerobium, it
possesses a pH tolerance up to 12 and a growth optimum at pH
11. This is the ﬁrst report of a true alkaliphilic strain of Halanaer-
obium. As such, we have proposed that this strain be recognized
as a new species. We proposed the species name of H. hydrogeni-
formans: hy.dro.ge.ni.for’mans. N.L. n. hydrogenum (from Gr. n.
hudôr, water; and Gr. v. gennaô, to produce), hydrogen; L. part. adj.
formans, forming; N.L. part. adj. hydrogeniformans, hydrogen-
forming. This name was used to describe the recently sequenced
genome of this organism (GenBank deposition GQ215697; Brown
et al., 2011).

level 3 (Felsenstein, 1985; Nei and Kumar, 2000) in which the initial trees
were obtained with the random addition of sequences (10 replicates). The
tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths calculated using the average
pathway method (Nei and Kumar, 2000), and are in the units of the
number of changes over the whole sequence. All alignment gaps were
treated as missing data. There were a total of 1380 positions in the ﬁnal
dataset, out of which 301 were parsimony informative. Phylogenetic
analyses were conducted in MEGA4 (Tamura et al., 2007).

HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BY H. HYDROGENIFORMANS
When grown in serum bottles with 15 mM cellobiose and without
agitation at 33˚C, increase in optical density ceased after 125 h
while H2 production continued at a constant linear rate until
approximately 450 h (Figure 3A). This was consistent with acetate
and formate production along with decreasing cellobiose concen-
trations over the same time period (Figure 3B). Also of note, the
pH decreased from 10.5 to 10.0 during the ﬁrst 100 h of growth,
perhaps as a result of acetate production (Figure 3B), but was
maintained over the course of the cultivation. These data sug-
gest a constant rate of sugar metabolism until substrate levels
were exhausted with sugar metabolism not being obligately tied to
growth.

Under non-agitated conditions in serum bottles, H. hydrogeni-
formans grew as an opaque mass that adhered to the bottom of
the glass bottle. The addition of agitation resulted in a dramatic
increase in the growth rate and H2 evolution as well as a visible
decrease in the amount of mass adhering to the glass surfaces.
Culture agitation decreased the generation time to ∼12 h and
increased the biomass yield by three-fold while also increasing
the rate of H2 production ﬁve-fold and the overall H2 yield by
∼30% (Figure 4).Assessment of fermentative process efﬁciency
is routinely referred to as the “Hydrogen Molar Yield (HMY),”
and is determined by measuring the moles of H2 produced per
mole of a hexose or pentose sugar oxidized. The theoretical HMY
maximum for glucose via anaerobic fermentation is 4 (Hawkes
et al., 2002; Shung and Wen-Hsing, 2008). Facultative anaerobes,
such as enteric bacteria, have a HMY maximum of 2. With H.

hydrogeniformans in serum cultures, 5-carbon sugar HMY ranged
from 0.4 to 0.7; whereas 6-carbon sugars, including cellobiose,
yielded a HMY of 0.9–2.3 (Table 1). While this value is low com-
pared to the theoretical maximum, the highest published HMY
from glucose by an obligate anaerobic wild type strain, Clostrid-
ium beijerinckii RZF-1108, is 1.97 (Zhao et al., 2011). In com-
parison, strains considered for fermentation of cellulosic sugars,
such as Clostridium thermocellum, have been reported to produce
only 1.5 mol H2/mol hexose (Levin et al., 2006) and engineered
Clostridium paraputriﬁcum, over-expressing a hydrogenase, pro-
duced a maximal 2.4 mol H2/mol hexose (Morimoto et al., 2005).
E. coli has been engineered to achieve a HMY of 1.8, which is
near the theoretical maximum for a facultative anaerobe (Akhtar
and Jones, 2009).These results are comparable to the HMY of H.
hydrogeniformans growing on cellobiose. Clearly though, there is
room for improvement in biological H2 production toward the
theoretical maximum. Identiﬁcation of new strains with higher
HMY or metabolic engineering of current strains, including H.
hydrogeniformans, are possible routes toward achieving this goal.
One of the ﬁrst steps toward determining industrial feasibil-
ity is to move from sealed bottles to small bioreactors, preferably
in fed-batch mode. This was performed using H. hydrogenifor-
mans on several carbon sources. Bioreactor grown cells consumed
30 mM glucose within 67 h and yielded stoichiometric amounts of
acetate and formate in a molar ratio of 3:1 (Figure 5A) with 75%
of the available carbon from glucose being accounted for under
the conditions tested (Table 2). Examination of the genome of H.
hydrogeniforms resulted in the identiﬁcation of several pathways

for acetate production from pyruvate (Figure 6). If one assumes
that all acetate produced from pathways other than through pyru-
vate formate lyase results in the production of CO2, 90% of the
carbon can be accounted for. The exit gas H2 productivity proﬁle
peak occurred at 50 h and then decreased sharply (Figure 5B).
Numerical integration of the exit gas H2 concentration over time
yielded the total molar H2 production.

(2.016 g/mol), and w is the H2 concentration in the exit gas sample
(ppm). Dividing Eq. 1 by the liquid volume and the reaction time

where H2prod is the volumetric productivity of H2 production
(micromoles/L/h),Vol is the liquid volume (L), and t is the reaction
time (min). The maximum H2 productivity was 1.14 mmol/L/h
(Table 2) which was ∼50% of the 2.35 mmol/L/h reported for
serum cultures using glucose. The HMY was calculated as
HMY (t ) = TotMolH2 (t )
[C (0) − C (t )] Vol

(3)

where HMY is (mmol/mmol), and C is the substrate concentra-
tion, (mM). The HMY at maximum productivity was 2.42 mmol
H2/mmol glucose (Table 2). This is less than the theoretical yield
of 4.0 when producing acetate, which suggests that some of the
available NADH from glycolysis is not being oxidized to H2 by the
hydrogenase.

Bioreactor grown cells consumed 15 mM cellobiose within
∼100 h, producing acetate and formate with a molar ratio of
3.8:1 (Figure 5C) with ∼70% of the available carbon being
accounted for under the conditions tested. If one accounts for
assumed CO2 production based on identiﬁed pathways, one
can account for 92% of carbon from cellobiose (Table 2). The
exit gas H2 concentration proﬁle peaked at 73 h, with a max-
imum hydrogen productivity of 0.71 mmol/L/h, occurring at
94 h (Figure 5D). This agreed well with serum bottle culture
value of 0.7 mmol/L/h. The HMY at maximum productivity was
2.39 mmol H2/mmol glucose equivalent and was similar to the
glucose cultivation above. Bioreactor cultivations with 150 mM
cellobiose exhausted the cellobiose supply within 100 h and yielded
an acetate to formate molar ratio of 4:1 with a H2 productivity of
0.7 mmol/L/h with ∼70% of the available carbon being accounted
for; 90% again assuming CO2 production., and an HMY of 2.34
(Table 2).

to produce H2 from lignocellulosic material. Further, to do so at a
lower temperature and pressure would also reduce the carbon foot-
print and energy input of the process, streamlining it from current
methodologies as detailed above. To this end and to test feasibility
with H. hydrogeniformans in serum bottle cultures, shredded straw
and switchgrass were dried, passed through a 1 mm screen and
then subjected to a Na2CO3 alkaline pretreatment modiﬁed from
that described by Bjerre et al. (1996) by the use of 40 g Na2CO3/L

instead of 10 g/L at several temperatures. Using the lower Na2CO3
concentration and high pressure with wheat straw,Aspergillus niger
produced the highest ethanol concentration with a pretreatment
of 170˚C for 10 min after neutralization of the hemicellulosic
liquor (Bjerre et al., 1996). When crystalline cellulose was tested by
these researchers, the same pretreatment conditions resulted in the
highest conversion to the more bioavailable amorphous cellulose
(Bjerre et al., 1996).

produced with these temperatures and higher Na2CO3 concentra-
tions (Klinke et al., 2004). The rates of biohydrogen production
were 0.37 and 0.88 μmol H2/h/mL for straw and switchgrass,
respectively, as compared to a range of 0.59 μmol H2/h/mL with
xylose or arabinose, and up to 2.35 μmol H2/h/mL with glucose.
The rate of hydrogen production with switchgrass was highly simi-
lar to that found recently using A. thermophilum DSM 6725 at 70˚C
(Yang et al., 2009). The values of 0.37 and 0.88 μmol H2/h/mL for
straw and switchgrass, respectively, are ∼12% of those generated
by a fully grown microbial consortium producing H2 from steam
explosion-treated corn stover (Datar et al., 2007) or generated in
various neutrophilic bioreactor conﬁgurations with glucose as the
feedstock (Gavala et al., 2006). However, a 10% (v/v) inoculum
was used in the present case in order to assess both H2 produc-
tion as well as the capacity to support growth. Hence, it would be
expected that if the feedstock was pumped into a bioreactor with
an already fully grown culture, this strain would likely produce H2
at an increased rate.

For bioreactor studies with switchgrass, after it was milled
and exposed to an alkaline pretreatment, the resulting super-
natant possessed ∼8.5 mM cellobiose. Chromatographic peaks
for monomers were blurred in the analysis, so it was impossi-
ble to determine the concentration of hemicellulose degradation
products and/or glucose in the sample. H. hydrogeniformans con-
sumed the initial cellobiose charge within ∼200 h, producing an
acetate:formate molar ratio of 3.5 (Figure 7E). The exit gas (H2)
peaked at 190 h and then decreased sharply with a maximum H2
productivity of 2.93 mM/L/h (Figure 7F, Table 2). This is approx-
imately four times higher productivity than with pure cellobiose
and twice that of pure glucose, but the time to achieve this pro-
ductivity was almost three times that of the pure carbon sources.
This suggested that while the degradation of the switchgrass liquor
required a longer residence time, the eventual biohydrogen pro-
ductivity may cancel out the greater time required. Further opti-
mization of both the fermentation process and the pretreatment
will likely decrease the residence time required for the fermenta-
tion process, thus resulting in equal or higher H2 productivity with
a faster turnover time.

While growth and biohydrogen production were supported
with the liquor, H. hydrogeniformans also used the solid residue
remaining from the pretreatment, although to a diminished extent
and only producing between 23 and 32 μmoles of H2 with either
feedstock (data not shown). The solid residue may primarily
be insoluble, amorphous cellulose. The inability of H. hydro-
geniformans to more efﬁciently metabolize the insoluble cellu-
losic material can be tracked to the genome which contains no
genes annotated as cellulases. In order to achieve more complete
conversion of plant biomass, additional treatments steps would
be needed such as incubation with high pH tolerance cellulose
degrading enzymes. An alternative would be genetic engineer-
ing of H. hydrogeniformans for the production cellulases to allow
more complete conversion of plant biomass. Either option would
serve to degrade the amorphous and crystalline cellulose to cel-
lobiose and glucose, which could then be metabolized by this
bacterium to produce H2. Genetic manipulation is likely the
more cost efﬁcient method in the longer-term and will require
the development of a facile genetic system. Additionally, a system

In the present work, digestion of the non-neutralized hemi-
cellulosic liquor produced from switchgrass or straw was tested
for hydrogen production with duplicate cultures using various
pretreatment temperatures at ambient pressure. Pretreatments
included room temperature (RT; overnight), 55˚C (2 h) 75˚C (2 h),
90˚C (1 h), 130˚C (15 min), 150˚C (15 min), or 170˚C (15 min)
with treatments at 55˚C yielding the best hydrogen production
rate and extent (Figure 7A,B), followed by RT and 75˚C. With
each lignocellulosic material, protein concentrations more than
tripled by the end of the incubation for the RT and 55˚C pre-
treatments (Figure 7C,D), suggesting cellular growth from the
pretreatment liquor while the higher pretreatment temperatures
yielded far less protein. This was concomitant with the greatest
production of acetate in both the straw (6 mM at RT; 2.5 mM
at 55˚C) and switchgrass (9 mM at RT; 14 mM at 55˚C) as mea-
sured by HPLC analysis (data not shown). Individual sugars could
not be identiﬁed in the liquors when compared with pure sugar
standards (data not shown). From pretreated straw, hydrogen pro-
duction was best at 55˚C, with RT and 75˚C yielding similar results
but less then 55˚C. Use of the RT pretreatment would require fur-
ther exploration to determine if the smaller yield of biohydrogen
could be offset by the further reduction of the carbon footprint
for biohydrogen production from straw. With switchgrass, how-
ever, the difference was far more distinct and the overall H2 yield
was more than double that of straw. In both cases, the pH did not
fall below 10.2 during the incubations. Other differences included
the lack of H2 production with switchgrass at 90 and 130˚C but
some production at 150 and 170˚C (Figure 7A), suggesting that
