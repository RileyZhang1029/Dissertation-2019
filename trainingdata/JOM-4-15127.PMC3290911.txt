Gingival epithelium produces b-defensins, small cationic peptides, as part of its contribution to the innate
host defense against the bacterial challenge that is constantly present in the oral cavity. Besides their functions
in healthy gingival tissues, b-defensins are involved in the initiation and progression, as well as restriction of
periodontal tissue destruction, by acting as antimicrobial, chemotactic, and anti-inflammatory agents. In this
article, we review the common knowledge about b-defensins, coming from in vivo and in vitro monolayer
studies, and present new aspects, based on the experience on three-dimensional organotypic culture models,
to the important role of gingival b-defensins in homeostasis of the periodontium.

Human gingival epithelium constitutes a stratified

squamous epithelium, which protects underlying
soft and hard tissues of the periodontium. Based
on its location and composition, gingival epithelium is
divided into oral gingival, oral sulcular, and junctional
epithelia. In regard to its highly specified cell-to-cell
junctions and high renewal capabilities, gingival epithe-
lium was for long time considered a strong but passive
barrier against the bacterial challenge that is constantly
present in the oral cavity. With improved understanding
of the periodontal disease pathogenesis,
it has been
recognized that the epithelium is not only a mechanical
barrier but, by secreting chemokines and proinflamma-
tory cytokines,
it also plays a significant role in the
initiation and progression of the inflammation-mediated
destruction of periodontal

identification of a new group of oxygen-independent
antimicrobial peptides in gingival epithelial cells brought
a new aspect to the role of the epithelium in the host
defense against oral bacteria (1). These cysteine-rich

Defensins were among the first antimicrobial peptides
to be described in mammalians. In humans, defensins
consist of two subfamilies, a- and b-defensins. While
a-defensins are produced by polymorphonuclear leuko-
cytes and intestinal paneth cells, b-defensins are produced
by epithelial cells. The latter group of defensins was first
identified in tracheal epithelial cells two decades ago
(2, 3). Human b-defensins are expressed by various

epithelial cell types,
including the epithelium of the
airways, kidney, skin, cornea, and gingiva (4, 5). Four
different human b-defensins (hBD 14) have been found
and functionally characterized, however, based on geno-

human oral cavity (1, 8, 9).

In the review, we introduce new perspectives on various
functions of gingival b-defensins, namely hBD 13, by

the biological activity of
b-defensins through their functional properties, expres-
sion, localization, and interaction with other protective
mechanisms (Table 1). The structure and gene distribu-
tion of b-defensins are out of the present scope, so the
readers are advised to consult with well-written reviews
on these topics (10, 11).

Antibacterial effect of b-defensins: mechanisms
and limitations
Microbicidal activities against gram-positive and gram-
negative bacteria, fungi, and some parasites are common
characteristics of all b-defensins examined in in vitro
conditions (12). Like a-defensins, human b-defensins
have been thought to exert their antibacterial effects by
permeabilizing the bacterial cellular membrane (13). Pore
formation on the membrane stimulates the leakage of
small molecules from the bacterial cell that eventually

leads to its death. However, these membrane disruption
characteristics are not universal, but vary depending on
the defensin type and bacterial species (10, 11). The
bacterial membrane-selective characteristic of b-defensins
mainly depends on the electrostatic interaction between
the cationic structure of b-defensins and negatively
charged bacterial membranes. Since the negative charge
on bacterial cell membranes is much higher than that on
mammalian cell membranes, there is a selective binding
between b-defensins and bacterial membranes (14). In the
literature, other explanations for this phenomenon have
been presented; for example, according to the novel
hypothesis of Schmidt and coworkers on bacterial
membranes, the amino acid composition and design of
cationic antimicrobial peptides are the main determinants
in the preference of b-defensins (15).

b-defensins are broad-spectrum antibacterial peptides,
however, their antibacterial effect is considerably salt-
dependent. This means that b-defensins show their high-
est activities in conditions with low ion concentrations
and their antibacterial activities are significantly impaired
by the presence of ions, such as Na, Mg2, and Ca2
(16). Among the three b-defensins found in gingiva, hBD-
3 has the lowest sensitivity to salts, being insensitive up to
200 mM Na concentrations, most probably due to its
high positive charge (11), whereas hBD-1 has the
highest sensitivity, being insensitive up to 100 mM Na
concentrations. The inhibitory effect of salt ions on
antibacterial properties of b-defensins does not necessa-
rily be directed to their protein structure, but merely
to their interaction with bacteria (17). In the oral cavity,
b-defensins are constantly exposed to ions in saliva,
which contains 860 mM of NaCl. The salivary NaCl
concentration may be much less than what is needed to
inactivate b-defensins, however, NaCl is not the only ion
present
the orchestrated effect of
salivary ions may affect the function of b-defensins,
even if they do not totally impair their activity. Therefore,
it is plausible that b-defensins are inactive against oral
bacteria outside the tissues, like in saliva. On the other
there is evidence that b-defensins in in vivo
hand,
conditions are less sensitive to salts than in in vitro
conditions (18). Since the interaction between the host
and bacteria is a coordinated action with multiple
players, the decreased b-defensin response against bac-
teria may be compensated with other antibacterial
proteins. Further studies are necessary to clarify the
role of b-defensins against bacteria within and outside the
tissues.

in saliva. Indeed,

Beyond their antibacterial effects, b-defensins are
able to neutralize the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activity
of gram-negative bacteria (19). Very limited data exist
on periodontitis-associated organisms in this context.
In an experimental study, where the human acute
monocytic leukemia cell
line (THP-1) was incubated

with fluorescently labeled LPS of Tannerella forsythia,
it was demonstrated that all
tested defensin types,
hBD-1, hBD-2 and hBD-3, inhibited the LPS activity
by affecting the binding of LPS to monocytes (20). This
LPS-neutralizing effect of hBDs was independent from
their antibacterial activities in a similar way as shown
for LL-37, a member of
the cathelicidin family of
antimicrobial peptides (21).

Bacterial resistance against b-defensins
In response to the challenge by b-defensins, bacteria exert
resistance by forming a capsule, modifying their cell
envelope molecules, forming biofilms or cleaving defen-
sins (2224). Porphyromonas gingivalis, a well-known
periodontal pathogen, degrades hBD-3 with its gingi-
pains that leads to the inactivation of the peptide (25).
Also some other periodontal bacteria are able to protect
themselves from b-defensins, most probably, by inhibiting
the defensin expression pathways. For instance, Trepo-
nema denticola inhibits the secretion of hBD-2 and hBD-
3 by suppressing the expression of tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-a and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2) (26, 27). Hence,
the ability of these periodontitis-associated organisms to
overcome the b-defensin challenge seems to be associated
with their virulence (17, 28).

Recognition of periodontal bacteria in
stimulation of b-defensin secretion
To understand the process of b-defensin expression, the
recognition of periodontal bacteria by gingival epithelia is
of interest. TLRs provide the first line in the recognition
of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, hence, to
study the role of bacterial recognition in b-defensin
expression, TLR-deficient cell line models are preferred.
Using epithelial cell lines with silenced TLR2, it has been
demonstrated that Fusobacterium nucleatum and P.
gingivalis are not able to induce hBD-2 expression,
whereas the non-silenced cell
line expresses hBD-2
against these anaerobic bacteria (29). This corroborates
with the findings of another study where knockdown of
TLR2 RNA reduced the F. nucleatum-induced hBD-2
and hBD-3 upregulation with 93 and 96%, respectively
(30). The relation between TLR2 and hBDs has been
demonstrated using other periodontal bacteria and
bacterial components as well. Recently,
it was shown
that knockdown of TLR2 in immortalized gingival cells
suppresses hBD-3 expression in response to T. denticola
(26, 27). Unlike the activation of b-defensins by whole
bacteria, LPS of gram-negative bacteria, the main targets

(formerly Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans;
this
periodontal pathogen triggers hBD-2 secretion with its
outer membrane protein (OMP) 100, and the interaction
of OMP 100 with fibronectin activates the a5b1 integrin
signaling that ends up with the secretion of hBD-2 via the
MAP kinase pathway (4).

Periodontal bacteria and secretion of
b-defensins
RNA expression and secretion of hBD-2 and hBD-3,
unlike those of hBD-1, from epithelial cells are not
constituent but dependent on infectious or inflammatory
stimuli (912). Moreover, epithelial cells do not express
these two b-defensins against all bacteria. In culture
conditions, commensal bacteria, rather than major per-
iodontopathogens, are excellent stimulants of hBD-2
from gingival epithelia. According to Krisanaprakornkit
et al. (31), the incubation of gingival epithelial cells with
F. nucleatum, unlike that with P. gingivalis, effectively
triggers the hBD-2 mRNA expression. Later,
it was
demonstrated that the ability of F. nucleatum to induce
b-defensin secretion is related to its unique cell wall
protein, Fusobacterium-associated
inducer
(FAD)-1 and that isolated FAD-1 stimulates hBD-2
secretion via TLR2 (32). An interesting observation was
that P. gingivalis, after being transfected with FAD-1,
becomes able to induce hBD-2 from oral epithelial
cells (32).

defensin

The ability of P. gingivalis to evade the host recognition
and hBD-2 challenge can be regarded as part of its high
virulence (31, 33). The missing hBD-2 response against
P. gingivalis has been explained by its rather unusual LPS
structure, which may impair the cellular recognition of
P. gingivalis by epithelial cells and inhibit hBD-2 expres-
the b-defensin
sion (23). The selective character of
response has been confirmed in several other in vitro
studies. Vankeerberghen et al. (33) examined the stimula-
tion of hBD 14 using gingival epithelial cells incubated
with commensal and pathogenic bacteria. According to
their results, F. nucleatum increases the secretions of
hBD-2 and hBD-3 by epithelia, but not those of hBD-1
and hBD-4. On the other hand, P. gingivalis had no
stimulating effect on hBD-2 and hBD-4 secretions, while
hBD-1 secretion was evident after 14 h of incubation,
being similar to the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced
hBD-1 secretion. Incubation of epithelial cells with P.
gingivalis induced transiently hBD-3 expression but, after
3 h, the expression returned to the level at the baseline
(33). This time-dependent change in b-defensin secretion
can be attributed to the virulence of P. gingivalis, which
invades gingival epithelial cell monolayers within 90
minutes and then continues to replicate intracellularly
(34). During the invasion, P. gingivalis inhibits the
proliferation and migration of epithelial cells (35). In
this way, pathogenic P. gingivalis modulates the behavior

of host cells for its own benefits, which may also include
the impairment of hBD secretion. Since the invasion also
requires bacterial proteinases (34), the initially secreted
hBDs most probably are degraded by over-expressed P.
gingivalis proteases.

Interestingly,

significantly within the strains of

the stimulation of hBD-3 expression

the same
pathogenic bacterium. For example, the incubation of
epithelial cells with A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC
29523 did not change the hBD-3 expression profile of
host cells, while the strain ATCC 33384 enhanced hBD-3
expression significantly after 0.5 h of incubation (33). The
latter hBD-3 expression-inducing strain (serotype c) is
more frequently detected in periodontally healthy than in
periodontitis subjects, while A. actinomycetemcomitans
ATCC 29523 (serotype a), which hinders hBD-3 expres-
sion, is more prevalent in aggressive periodontitis patients
than in periodontally healthy subjects (36). Therefore, it
can be postulated that the capability of stimulating
b-defensin expressions is strain-dependent and, in parti-
cular, dependent on the bacterium’s association with
disease (30, 33). As already stated, there seems to be a
strong correlation between the virulence of a periodontal
pathogen and its ability to minimize the induction of
b-defensin expression and secretion.

In contrast to the current understanding, there are
some reports in the literature on pathogenic bacteria that
induce b-defensins from epithelia (37, 38). The difference
between bacterial strains tested or selected epithelial cell
lines may have an impact on the conflicting results. It is
known that b-defensins, which are secreted by many
epithelial cell types, differ in their regulation and expres-
sion characteristics. For example, in the respiratory tract,
where the epithelium is constantly exposed to the variety
of microorganisms, b-defensin genes are activated by all
types of bacteria and TLR agonists and induced primar-
ily through an NF-kB-mediated pathway (39). However,
in the gingival epithelium, an environment similar to the
respiratory tract in regard to the constant exposure to
microorganisms, b-defensin genes are activated by only a
subset of bacteria and TLR ligands and induced via
different pathways (39). Therefore, even though the
secretion of b-defensins is a common characteristic of
human epithelial cell types, the difference in the cellular
origin and regulation of the response should be taken
into account before generalizing the research outcomes.
The discrepancy between studies may also be due to
differences in study designs, including incubation inocula.

Periodontal bacteria and activation of
b-defensins: a hypothesis through hBD-1
To colonize and survive in the oral cavity, periodontal
pathogens develop mechanisms to evade the defensin
challenge, while periodontal health-associated bacteria
stimulate and activate gingival b-defensins. To understand

this complex relationship, the impact of bacteria on the b-
defensive response of the gingiva needs to be discussed.

b-defensins are regarded as being part of the non-
specific host response; in other words, they play a major
role in the innate protection by the epithelium. Therefore,
one would expect to see an enhanced b-defensin produc-
tion and activity when epithelial cells are exposed to
bacteria. Gingival hBD-1 secretion fits well with this
innate response hypothesis, since gingiva is constantly in
contact with numerous bacteria and hBD-1 is secreted
constitutively in the epithelium (40). There are hundreds
of bacterial species in the oral cavity, where hBD-1 may
take part in the suppression and control of this constant
bacterial exposure. Although hBD-1 is considered to
control the oral bacterial ecosystem at some level, in vitro
studies have demonstrated only a limited antimicrobial
effect of hBD-1 on oral bacteria. The antibacterial
activity of hBD-1 against periodontal pathogens is
much lower than that of hBD-2 and hBD-3 (17).
However, as recently demonstrated by Schroeder et al.
(41), hBD-1 requires post-translational changes to be-
come an active antimicrobial agent. According to their
results, the weak antibacterial effect of hBD-1 against
gram-positive anaerobes and Candida albicans can be
significantly enhanced after hBD-1 is reduced by the
thioredoxin system (41). Thioredoxin, which is a multi-
functional oxidoreductase, is mainly released by dendritic
cells upon contact with antigen-presenting T-cells
(42, 43). This new ground-breaking information indicates
that the constitutive hBD-1 secretion is a ready-to-be-
used system, and its antibacterial
functions can be

enhanced by post-translation modifications. As a second
hypothesis, oral bacteria may contribute to the hBD-1
activity through the thioredoxin system, at
in
extracellular regions. F. nucleatum, an opportunistic
pathogen, can increase its thioredoxin production when
exposed to oxidative stress (44). This may, at
least
hypothetically, point to oral bacteria in the activation
of secreted hBD-1 (Fig. 1). No data on b-defensins other
than hBD-1 exist in this context. Further studies are
needed to clarify this relationship.

b-defensins in regulation of innate and immune
responses
While hBD-1 is constitutively secreted in the epithelium,
hBD-2 and hBD-3 secretions are stimulation-dependent.
This stimulation does not necessarily come only from
bacteria, since proinflammatory cytokines are also able to
induce b-defensin secretion. In human keratinocytes,
proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, interferon
(IFN)-g, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-17, and IL-22, stimulate
hBD-2 secretion, while anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4
and IL-10, suppress its production (45). In in vitro
conditions, TNF-a induces expressions of hBD-2, hBD-
3, and hBD-4 from gingival epithelial cells without an
effect on hBD-1 expression (33). TNF-a is not the only
inducer of hBD secretion from gingival epithelia; hBD-2
secretion by gingival keratinocytes can be induced by
IL-1b and hBD-1 and hBD-3 secretions by IFN-g (28).
With the expanded knowledge about periodontal
diseases, it seems that the relation between b-defensins
and cytokines/chemokines
is bilateral. Similarities

hypothetically, play a role in the activation of hBD-1 via its thioredoxin reductase, an enzyme which increases intracellularly as a
response to oxidative stress.

between chemokines and b-defensins have been described
at a functional level; chemokines present antimicrobial
effects and b-defensins can act as chemoattractants (16).
In addition to the induction of proinflammatory cytokine
secretions, b-defensins impair inflammatory pathways,
and bring blood cells, in particular, to the site of infection
by acting as chemotactic agents (10, 45). Mast cells and
macrophages have been found to migrate towards hBD
indicating a chemotactic function of b-defensins
14,
(46). Recently, Yin et al. (47) demonstrated that although
all b-defensins contribute to the immune response, there
are marked differences between their chemotactic effects.
According to their study, hBD-2 from gingival epithelial
cells significantly induces IL-6 secretion from dendritic
cells, while hBD-3 induces monocyte chemotactic protein
(MCP)-1 from the same cell type. b-defensins may have
immuno-modulatory effects through connective tissue
cells; in in vitro conditions, hBD-2 and hBD-3 trigger
fibroblast proliferation (48) and, more specifically,
hBD-3 stimulates
cyclooxygenase-2 expression and
prostaglandin E2 synthesis of fibroblasts (49).

The role of b-defensins in the immune response is not
only through aggravating it, but also suppressing the
response. hBD-3 inhibits the proinflammatory response
by inhibiting the secretion of TNF-a from human
myelomonocytic cells (50), while hBD-2 inhibits the IL-
17 production by T-cells (45). In LPS-treated mice,
the TNF-a
injected hBD-3 significantly suppresses
production. Anti-inflammatory effects of hBD-3 are
independent on the production of IL-10, a well known
anti-inflammatory cytokine (50).

b-defensins in gingival wound healing
Besides their antibacterial and immune-regulatory func-
tions, b-defensins contribute to the healing process of
wounds. Wound healing has four phases: inflammation,
re-epithelization, granulation tissue formation, and tissue
remodeling. The re-epithelization phase requires migra-
tion, differentiation, and proliferation of epithelial cells
(51). In addition, hBD-2 and hBD-3, but not hBD-1,
increase keratinocyte migration and proliferation (52). As
demonstrated in in vitro conditions, hBD-2 promotes
intestinal wound healing (53). It can be anticipated that
b-defensins contribute to and play an active role also in
gingival wound healing, however, there is no scientific
evidence available on their contribution so far.

Localization of b-defensins in gingiva and in
organotypic epithelium models
Although hBD 13 are rather similar concerning their
structures and functions, they differ from each other in
their localizations of expression and secretion. To start
with, b-defensins are not detected in the junctional
epithelium, an area which is often affected with inflam-
mation, but they are secreted and present in the oral and

sulcular epithelium. b-defensin expression in epithelial
cells is highly connected to the cellular differentiation.
Involucrin, a strong marker of cell differentiation, has
similar localization patterns with hBD-1 and hBD-2 in
gingiva (1). In gingival tissues, mRNAs of hBD-1 and
hBD-2 are expressed in the spinous layer, while the
peptides are present in the granular layers of the gingiva
(1). On the other hand, hBD-3 localizes in the basal
layers of the gingival epithelium (54).

Localization and stimulation patterns of hBD-1, hBD-
2, and hBD-3 are very similar in vivo and in vitro; in three-
dimensional organotypic epithelium models, hBD-1 and
hBD-2 are secreted from the superficial
layers of the
model, while hBD-3 is localized on the basal cell layers (1,
55, 56). Similar to findings in monolayer studies, hBD-2
and hBD-3 secretions are barely visible in non-infected
control models, whereas their secretions clearly increase
after being infected with F. nucleatum biofilms (56).

In the context of defensins, the major contribution of
in vitro organotypic models is much more than confirm-
ing the localization patterns of b-defensins; the model
enables to follow the secretion patterns of b-defensins in
response to bacterial exposure. In our recent study (56),
hBD-2 and hBD-3 secretions were followed in an
organotypic dento-epithelial culture model. After 5 h of
infection with F. nucleatum biofilms, the secretions of
hBD-2 and hBD-3 were significantly increased in the
superficial and basal layers of the model, respectively.
After 24 h of
infection, hBD-2 extended from the
superficial layers to the basal layers of the epithelium,
while hBD-3 extended towards superficial
layers (56).
The re-localization patterns of hBDs in in vitro organo-
typic dento-epithelial culture model are in line with their
patterns in gingival tissues, where hBD-2 extends towards
the basal layers and hBD-3 towards the superficial layers
of the epithelium (54, 57) (Fig. 2).

b-defensins in periodontal health and disease
Based on in vitro studies with monolayer and multilayer
cell culture designs, infection and inflammation influence
the secretions of hBD-2 and hBD-3, while hBD-1 is
secreted constitutively. Furthermore, especially in multi-
layer models, the levels of hBD-2 and hBD-3 secretions
correlate to the incubation time with bacteria (56).
However, there are apparent discrepancies in the infec-
tion-induced character of hBD-2 and hBD-3 secretions
between in vitro and in vivo conditions. In analyses of
gingival biopsies from periodontitis subjects and from
their healthy controls, mRNAs of hBD-1, hBD-2, and
hBD-3 were found at lower levels in inflamed gingival
tissues than in healthy ones (8, 5862). Protein levels, on
the other hand, varied, being either slightly higher or
equal, or in some cases lower, in periodontitis subjects
than in their periodontally healthy counterparts (57, 62,
63). Decreased b-defensin expression has been shown

Understanding the roles of gingival beta-defensins

Fig. 2. The re-localization character of b-defensins in gingiva during the periodontal disease pathogenesis. (a) hBD-1 is
constitutively expressed in the superﬁcial layers of healthy gingiva, (b) when stimulated by infectious agents (e.g. gram-negative
bacteria or their lipopolysaccharides), hBD-2 is secreted in the superﬁcial layers, while hBD-3 is secreted in the basal layers of
the epithelium, (c) with the progression of the disease, hBD-2 secretion extends towards the basal layers, while hBD-3 secretion
extends towards the superﬁcial layers of the epithelium.

at the induction phase of an experimental gingivitis
model (60). These observations by different research
groups raise attention, however, no clear answer has
been given to define why the expression and secretion
of b-defensins are suppressed during periodontitis.
Concomitantly, several hypotheses have been presented
to explain the discrepancy. Degradation of b-defensins
by bacteria- or host-derived enzymes and genetic

polymorphisms,
leading to suppressed expression of
defensins, are among the common explanations, which
are discussed in detail below.

in periodontitis,

The first hypothesis is that,

the
secreted b-defensins
are degraded by proteolytic
enzymes produced by periodontal pathogens and the
host (63). Periodontal pathogens are able to eliminate
the b-defensin challenge in different ways,
including

Fig. 3. A ﬁve-step hypothesis of the recruitment and dismissal of b-defensins during infection. (a) Within the healthy tissue,
epithelial cells secrete only hBD-1, (b) the presence of commensal (C) and pathogenic (P) bacteria induce hBD-2 and hBD-3
secretions from the epithelium, (c) enhanced proportions of bacteria activate the variety of hBD responses, (d) the increasing b-
defensin levels suppress the amount of bacteria, however, some defensin-tolerant pathogenic strains are able to pass through the
hBD barrier, when enhanced b-defensin levels trigger the chemotactic activity through lymphocytes and monocytes, (e) at the
ﬁnal phase, hBD secretions return to the levels seen in a healthy condition, while the second phase of inﬂammation continues
with the interplay between invaded bacteria/bacterial components and immune cells.

the degradation of these host peptides. For example,
trypsin-like proteases and gingipains of P. gingivalis
degrade hBD-1, hBD-2, and hBD-3 (25, 62, 63). In
addition to bacterial proteases, proteolytic enzymes of
the host may contribute to b-defensin degradation.
Cysteine proteinase family enzymes, cathepsin B and
L, which are produced predominantly by macrophages,
increase in gingival
tissues with the initiation and
progression of periodontitis. These enzymes can degrade
and inactivate hBD-2 and hBD-3 in in vitro conditions
(64).

According to the second hypothesis, the replacement of
innate response with immune response during the period-
ontal disease process is responsible for the decreased
b-defensin secretion (61). In the gingival epithelium,
b-defensins form the first line of defense, being prepared
to awaken the innate response to increasing bacterial
exposure. From an initial gingival
lesion towards the
formation of an established lesion, antibacterial functions
of b-defensins are replaced by immune cells
(61).
Colonization of bacteria enhances the secretions of
hBD 13, which in turn inhibit the bacterial growth
and biofilm formation at some level. Instead, bacteria
with resistance to b-defensins, such as T. denticola and
P. gingivalis, survive and colonize on epithelial surfaces,
and, eventually, invade gingival tissues (65). With the
bacterial invasion, b-defensins stimulate the secretion of
chemokines, such as IL-8 and MCP-1, from dendritic
cells, and, in addition, act as chemoattractants, which
bring phagocytes and lymphocytes to the site of infection
(47). Taken together, the activated immune response
limits innate response and, hence, secretion of b-defensins
(Fig. 3).

In the third hypothesis, genetic polymorphisms in
b-defensin genes are emphasized (63, 66); b-defensin
expression and secretion are not decreasing in period-
ontitis, but subjects with low b-defensin secretion due to
some genetic variations are susceptible to develop period-
ontitis. Polymorphisms in hBD-encoding genes were
previously linked with the bacterial carriage or disease
activity (6769). For example, in subjects with type 1
diabetes mellitus and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in
their hBD-1-encoding genes high rates of C. albicans have
been detected (67). Recently, functional polymorphisms
of hBD genes were related to the presence of caries
lesions (68). The link between functional polymorphisms
of defensin genes and the susceptibility to periodontitis is
likely, but needs to be proven.

Concluding remarks
b-defensins constitute major antimicrobial peptides in
the initial response against bacteria in gingival tissues. In
addition, they function as both proinflammatory and
anti-inflammatory agents in the periodontal disease
pathogenesis.
It was previously considered that all

hBDs play the same role, but in a coordinated manner.
This coordination starts with hBD-1 secretion, which is
performed constantly in the oral and sulcular epithe-
lium. With the bacterial infection, the second response
comes from hBD-2, which is strongly secreted in the
superficial layers of the epithelium. With the progression
of the infection, hBD-3 secretion, starts in the basal cell
layers of the epithelium, then extending towards its
superficial layers. Currently, it is considered that the re-
localization of b-defensins in gingiva regulates the host
reaction, first by initiating and, at some level, by limiting
the immune response. Yet, the function of b-defensins in
the periodontium is not limited to its role in defense, but
these peptides may also have a role in wound healing by
regenerating the damaged epithelium. Indeed,
these
antibacterial peptides can even take part in periodontal
regeneration, by promoting the attachment and prolif-
eration of fibroblasts on the diseased root surfaces (70).
It is not an exaggeration to consider b-defensins, despite
their small sizes, as major players in the epithelial
functioning and homeostasis.
