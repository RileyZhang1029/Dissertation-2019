Most therapeutic antibodies that have been licensed and devel-
oped as medical agents are of the human IgG1 isotype. Hu-
man IgG1 is a heavily fucosylated glycoprotein bearing two N-
linked biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides bound to the
antibody constant region (Fc) via Asn-297, and it exercises bio-
logical activities referred to as “effector functions” of antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) through the interaction of the Fc
with either leukocyte receptors (FcγRs) or complement com-
ponents. Genetic analyses of FcγR polymorphisms of can-
cer patients have demonstrated that ADCC is one of the
major critical mechanisms responsible for the clinical efﬁ-
cacy of therapeutic antibodies such as anti-CD20 rituximab
(Rituxan R(cid:1)
) (Cartron
et al. 2002; Weng and Levy 2003; Dall’Ozzo et al. 2004;
Gennari et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2006). For patients carrying
the high-afﬁnity FcγRIIIa allotype (FcγRIIIa-Val-158), in con-
trast to those carrying the low-afﬁnity allotype (FcγRIIIa-Phe-
158), superior clinical responses have also been demonstrated in
cases such as rituximab-treated systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) and Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, Crohn’s disease
treatment with anti-TNF-α inﬂiximab (Remicade R(cid:1)
), and preg-
nant women with fetal hemolytic disease treated with anti-RhD
(Anolik et al. 2003; Louis et al. 2004; Miescher et al.
2004; Treon et al. 2005). Thus, the importance of ADCC for
the clinical efﬁcacy of therapeutic antibodies is now widely
recognized.

Human leukocyte receptor IIIa (FcγRIIIa) plays an im-
portant role in mediating therapeutic antibodies’ antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is closely
related to the clinical efﬁcacy of anticancer processes in
humans in vivo. The removal of the core fucose from
oligosaccharides attached to the Fc region of antibodies im-
proves FcγRIIIa binding, allowing the antibodies to enhance
dramatically the antibody effector functions of ADCC. In
this study, the contribution of FcγRIIIa oligosaccharides
to the strength of the FcγRIIIa/antibody complex was
analyzed using a serial set of soluble human recombinant
FcγRIIIa lacking the oligosaccharides. A nonfucosylated
antibody IgG1 appeared to have a signiﬁcantly higher afﬁn-
ity to the wild-type FcγRIIIa fully glycosylated at its ﬁve
N-linked oligosaccharide sites than did the fucosylated
IgG1, and this increased binding was almost abolished
once all of the FcγRIIIa glycosylation was removed. Our
gain-of-function analysis in the FcγRIIIa oligosaccharide
at Asn-162 (N-162) conﬁrmed that N-162 is the element
required for the high binding afﬁnity to nonfucosylated
antibodies, as previously revealed by loss-of-function anal-
yses. Interestingly, beyond our expectation, the FcγRIIIa
modiﬁed by N-162 alone showed a signiﬁcantly higher
binding afﬁnity to nonfucosylated IgG1 than did the
wild-type FcγRIIIa. Attachment of the other four oligosac-
charides, especially the FcγRIIIa oligosaccharide at Asn-45
(N-45), hindered the high binding afﬁnity of FcγRIIIa to
nonfucosylated IgG1. Our data clearly demonstrated that
N-45 is an inhibitory element for the high FcγRIIIa binding
afﬁnity mediated by N-162 to nonfucosylated antibodies.
This information can be exploited for the structural-based
functional study of FcγRIIIa.

Interestingly, the Fc oligosaccharide structures of therapeutic
antibodies greatly inﬂuence FcγRIIIa binding, and the removal
of the core fucose from Fc oligosaccharides dramatically en-
hances the effector functions of ADCC via improved FcγRIIIa
binding both in vitro and in vivo (Shields et al. 2002; Shinkawa
et al. 2003; Niwa, Hatanaka, et al. 2004; Niwa, Shoji-Hosaka,
et al. 2004; Yamane-Ohnuki et al. 2004; Niwa et al. 2005;
Iida et al. 2006; Kanda et al. 2006; Satoh et al. 2006; Suzuki
et al. 2007). Although fucose depletion from the Fc oligosac-
charides of antibodies is found to improve binding afﬁnity
to FcγRIIIa via an enthalpy-driven and association-rate-assisted
mechanism (Okazaki et al. 2004), the precise, structurally
based mechanisms of the afﬁnity enhancement remain to be
elucidated. In the FcγRIIIa/IgG complexes, the interaction
sites on the Fc for binding to FcγRIIIa form protein por-
tions in the hinge and CH2 regions only (Morgan et al. 1995;
Clark 1997). The generation of the essential Fc tertiary con-
formation for binding to FcγRIIIa depends on the presence
of the Fc oligosaccharides attached to the CH2 domains,
and the antibody effector functions mediated via FcγRIIIa
are severely abrogated in aglycosylated forms of antibodies
(Tao and Morrison 1989; Krapp et al. 2003). The crystal

structure analysis of human IgG1 has revealed that the antibody
oligosaccharides linked to the Fc are integral to the protein
portion of the Fc and form multiple noncovalent interactions
with the CH2 domains (Huber et al. 1976; Harris et al. 1998;
Radaev et al. 2001). Thus, multiple noncovalent interactions
between the oligosaccharides and the protein exert a reciprocal
inﬂuence of each on the conformation of the other, and these
complexities of human IgG1, along with the core fucose hetero-
geneity of the Fc oligosaccharides, delicately affect the binding
afﬁnity with FcγRIIIa.

Human FcγRIIIa is also a glycoprotein bearing ﬁve N-linked
oligosaccharides bound to the asparagine residues at positions
38, 45, 74, 162, and 169 (Ravetch and Perussia 1989). Recently,
based on the crystal structure analysis, the ADCC enhancement
by IgG1 lacking core fucosylation was attributed to a subtle
conformational change in a limited region of the Fc of IgG1
(Matsumiya et al. 2007), and the high afﬁnity of nonfucosylated
antibodies for FcγRIIIa is partially mediated by interactions
formed between the FcγRIIIa oligosaccharide at Asn-162 and
regions of the Fc that are only accessible when the Fc oligosac-
charides are nonfucosylated (Ferrara et al. 2006). In this study,
we focused on the FcγRIIIa oligosaccharides to elucidate their
functions in the complex interaction between FcγRIIIa and IgG1
antibody molecules more precisely. The results give us new and
important insights for better understanding the efﬁcacy of an-
tibody therapies, especially therapeutic antibodies lacking core
fucosylation.

Puriﬁcation of N-linked oligosaccharide-depleted FcγRIIIa
A serial set of
the hexa-His-tagged soluble human re-
combinant FcγRIIIa (shFcγRIIIa-His) lacking the N-linked
oligosaccharides was generated by altering asparagine of
the N-glycosylation sites into glutamine using the wild-type
FcγRIIIa-Val-158 bearing ﬁve N-linked glycosylation sites as
a template. These included shFcγRIIIa-His
lacking all
ﬁve N-linked oligosaccharides
(No-oligo-shFcγRIIIa-His),
shFcγRIIIa-His bearing only one oligosaccharide at Asn-162
(N162-shFcγRIIIa-His), shFcγRIIIa-His bearing oligosaccha-
rides at both Asn-45 and Asn-162 (N45-N162-shFcγRIIIa-His),
shFcγRIIIa-His lacking only one oligosaccharide at Asn-45
(No-N45-shFcγRIIIa-His), and the wild-type shFcγRIIIa-His
bearing all ﬁve N-linked oligosaccharides (Figure 1). The
N-terminal amino acid of these shFcγRIIIa-His proteins was
uniﬁed to Glu3 by directly connecting to a signal peptide to
avoid the N-terminal amino acid heterogeneity observed in the
expression of original FcγRIIIa cDNA. The mammalian expres-
sion vector carrying each cDNA for the wild-type and mutants
was introduced into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line
CHO/DG44, and the expressed products were puriﬁed from
the culture medium by Ni-NTA chromatography. The wild-type
shFcγRIIIa-His migrated as a broadband of a glycoprotein with
the appropriate molecular weight of about 37 kDa (Figure 2,
lane 1).
In the expression of N162-shFcγRIIIa-His, de-
graded products were observed (Figure 2, lane 2), and the
N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the
lowest SDS–PAGE band under the reducing condition con-
tained the four degraded products whose N-terminal amino acid
sequences were Glu3-Asp-Leu-Lys-Pro-Lys-Ala-Val-Val-Phe-
Leu13, Lys131-Tyr-Phe-His-His-Asn136, Ala144-Thr-Leu-Lys-
Asp-Ser-Gly-Ser-Tyr152, and Asp148-Ser-Gly-Ser-Tyr-Phe153

and middle bands was Glu3-Asp-Leu-Lys-Pro-Lys-Ala-Val-Val-
Phe-Leu13 (Figure 3). This degradation was not inhibited even
though the culture medium was prepared in the presence of
protease inhibitors including 0.5 mM PMSF, 3.6 µM pepstatin
A, 0.3 µM aprotinin, 16.1 µM bestatin, 5.6 µM E-64, and 4.6
µM leupeptin. Comparable degraded products were also ob-
served in No-oligo-shFcγRIIIa-His, although no such degraded
product was observed among the other three shFcγRIIIa-His
recombinants (data not shown). Subsequent gel ﬁltration chro-
matography excluded the degraded products to yield almost
homogeneously puriﬁed (over 95%) products in SDS–PAGE
analysis under the nonreducing condition (Figure 4A). All pu-
riﬁed shFcγRIIIa-His products migrated as bands with almost
the same sizes as we had expected in SDS–PAGE (Figure 4).

SDS–PAGE analysis under the reducing condition revealed that
two puriﬁed samples, that of No-oligo-shFcγRIIIa-His and that
of N162-shFcγRIIIa-His, each still contained a band with a
lower molecular weight than the expected products, which was
observed in the products puriﬁed by Ni-NTA chromatography
(Figure 4B). Interestingly, IgG afﬁnity chromatography anal-
ysis showed that the band retained the ability to bind IgG1
(Figure 5). The majority of the attached oligosaccharides
of N162-shFcγRIIIa-His were of the sialylated biantennary
complex-type oligosaccharides containing two galactoses with
a fucosylated core structure, and the nonsialylated neutral
oligosaccharide form was a minor component of the oligosac-
charides attached to N162-shFcγRIIIa-His (Figure 6). The
oligosaccharide structure of the wild type and other shFcγRIIIa-
His mutants produced by CHO/DG44 was conﬁrmed to be of
the complex type (data not shown).

fect on the binding afﬁnity to nonfucosylated IgG1 to increase
the binding afﬁnity of No-N45-shFcγRIIIa-His (Figure 8B and
H). N45-N162-shFcγRIIIa-His carrying two N-linked oligosac-
charides at Asn-45 and Asn-162 showed higher binding afﬁn-
ity to nonfucosylated IgG1 than the wild-type shFcγRIIIa-His
having three more N-linked oligosaccharides (Figure 8B and
G). The FcγRIIIa mutant lacking all ﬁve N-linked oligosac-
charides of No-oligo-shFcγRIIIa-His had the weakest binding
afﬁnity to nonfucosylated IgG1 among all tested shFcγRIIIa-His
(Figure 8D). The interaction of fucosylated IgG1 with FcγRIIIa
was not as strong as that observed between nonfucosylated IgG1
and FcγRIIIa as a whole. The afﬁnity of N162-shFcγRIIIa-
His to fucosylated IgG1 was slightly weaker than that of No-
oligo-shFcγRIIIa-His, and N45-N162-shFcγRIIIa-His showed
the weakest afﬁnity to fucosylated IgG1.

Discussion

Recently, ADCC enhancement technology has been expected
to play key roles in improving the efﬁcacy of current thera-
peutic antibodies, especially anticancer antibodies. Enhance-
ment of the binding of therapeutic antibodies for FcγRIIIa has
received considerable attention for the development of next-
generation therapeutic antibodies with the improved clinical
efﬁcacy of ADCC. Indeed, several clinical trials using such
therapeutics are ongoing. To understand the physiological func-
tions and to examine in detail the efﬁcacy of these new types
of therapies in vivo, it is very important to understand the in-
teractions between the therapeutics and the target molecule for
the effector functions. Thus, in this study, we focused on the
interaction between FcγRIIIa and therapeutic antibodies, es-
pecially on the effects of the FcγRIIIa oligosaccharides on
the high binding afﬁnity of FcγRIIIa to IgG1 lacking core
fucosylation.

FcγRIIIa of mammalian origin is well known as a highly gly-
cosylated protein with ﬁve N-linked glycosylation sites. How-
ever, only a few observations are available on the inﬂuences
of the FcγRIIIa oligosaccharides on the functions of FcγRIIIa,
namely, monomeric fucosylated IgG binds to FcγRIIIa lack-
ing the N-linked oligosaccharide at Asn-162 with higher afﬁn-
ity than to the wild-type FcγRIIIa (Ferrara et al. 2006). This
ﬁnding has also been reported in the loss-of-function anal-
ysis of FcγRIIIb, the highly homologous FcγR having the
oligosaccharide at the same position as FcγRIIIa, by means of
prokaryotic expression, glycosylation site mutation, and
tunicamysin-treatment glycosylation depletion in mammalian
cell expression (Galon et al. 1997; Drescher et al. 2003). In
this study, ﬁrst we found that it is hard to stably express agly-
cosylated FcγRIIIa without any degradation by mammalian
CHO/DG44 cells as host cells (Figure 2). This degradation
seemed to be caused by some intracellular event(s) because
the exogenous addition of protease inhibitors, including PMSF,
pepstatin A, aprotinin, bestatin, E-64, and leupeptin, into cul-
ture medium did not affect the phenomenon. FcγRIIIa carrying
just one N-linked oligosaccharide at Asn-162 (N-162) was also
degraded when expressed in mammalian CHO/DG44 cells, as
was aglycosylated FcγRIIIa. The cleavage sites were located in
a lysine and arginine cluster region of the FcγRIIIa D2 domain,
and the cathepsin-like proteases appeared to be responsible for
the cleavages (Figure 3). Interestingly, this degradation was not

was estimated by FcγRIIIa-binding ELISA and by surface plas-
mon resonance measurement using shFcγRIIIa-His. Compared
with the binding to fucosylated IgG1, the wild-type FcγRIIIa
showed superior binding afﬁnity to nonfucosylated IgG1. This
phenomenon was also observed in the three FcγRIIIa mutants
lacking the N-linked oligosaccharides except for the FcγRIIIa
mutant lacking all ﬁve N-linked oligosaccharides of No-oligo-
shFcγRIIIa-His (Figure 7). No-oligo-shFcγRIIIa-His showed
mostly equivalent binding to IgG1 irrespective of core fu-
cosylation and weaker binding than the other glycosylated
FcγRIIIas to nonfucosylated IgG1. A binding kinetics analysis
using a BIAcoreTM biosensor system T100 (BIAcore, Uppsala,
Sweden) conﬁrmed the differences observed in FcγRIIIa-
binding ELISA (Figure 8). The sensorgrams clearly showed that
N162-shFcγRIIIa-His carrying only one N-linked oligosaccha-
ride at Asn-162 had the strongest binding afﬁnity to nonfucosy-
lated IgG1 rather than the wild-type shFcγRIIIa-His (Figure 8B
and F) and that the additional attachment of N-linked oligosac-
charide at Asn-45 decreased the high binding afﬁnity (Figure 8F
and G). The deletion of the N-linked oligosaccharide at Asn-45
in the wild-type shFcγRIIIa-His also exhibited its negative ef-

antibodies, and the plates were incubated with the indicated concentration of nonfucosylated (Fu(−) (䊊)) and fucosylated (Fu(+) (䊉)) anti-CD20 IgG1s. Binding
was detected by peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human IgG1 polyclonal antibodies for a 10-min reaction. The mean values ± SD are shown.

observed in the FcγRIIIa carrying N-162 and one more N-linked
oligosaccharide at Asn-45 (N-45), which means that the attach-
ment of N-45 to the FcγRIIIa D1 domain affects the D2 domain
protease sensitivity despite the different domain location. The
N-45 attachment in the D1 domain might cause a conforma-
tional change of FcγRIIIa to further stabilize the D2 domain
structure.

We succeed in removing the degraded products from the sam-
ples by gel ﬁltration chromatography, and the puriﬁed samples
migrated as a homogeneous band with over 95% purity when
subjected to nonreducing SDS–PAGE analysis (Figure 4A).
However, the two puriﬁed samples of aglycosylated FcγRIIIa
and FcγRIIIa carrying one N-162 still contained a band with a
relatively lower molecular weight than the intact products we
had expected (Figure 4B). This unexpected band seemed to be
FcγRIIIa with a nick or a small fragment deletion in the D2
domain because the band, which was also observed before gel
ﬁltration puriﬁcation, had a comparable molecular weight of
the intact product under nonreducing condition with the intact
FcγRIIIa amino acid sequence (Figure 3). Interestingly, both the
intact and derivative FcγRIIIa products showed a capability to
bind IgG1 (Figure 5). The cleavage of the FcγRIIIa D2 domain
at the lysine and arginine cluster region might not necessarily
abolish the binding afﬁnity to IgG antibodies.

In this study, we prepared a set of FcγRIIIa recombinants pro-
duced by CHO/DG44 cells, in which all of the attached oligosac-
charides were of the complex type. Firstly, we conﬁrmed that
nonfucosylated antibody IgG1 shows signiﬁcantly higher bind-
ing afﬁnity to the fully glycosylated wild-type FcγRIIIa than

130

does the fucosylated IgG1 and that this increased binding is
almost abolished once all of the FcγRIIIa glycosylation is re-
moved (Ferrara et al. 2006). Moreover, our gain-of-function
analysis in the FcγRIIIa oligosaccharides also conﬁrmed that
N-162 is the element required for the high binding afﬁnity to
nonfucosylated antibodies and slightly reduces the afﬁnity to
fucosylated IgG1, as previously revealed by loss-of-function
analyses (Galon et al. 1997; Drescher et al. 2003; Ferrara et al.
2006). It is worth noting that, beyond our expectation, the gly-
cosylation at Asn-162 in FcγRIIIa signiﬁcantly enhanced bind-
ing afﬁnity to nonfucosylated IgG1 compared to the wild-type
FcγRIIIa, and attachment of the other four oligosaccharides,
especially N-45, hinders the high binding afﬁnity to nonfuco-
sylated IgG1. The crystal structure of aglycosylated FcγRIIIa,
in complex with the Fc fragment of human IgG1, indicates that
an oligosaccharide moiety at Asn-162 of FcγRIIIa could point
into the central cavity within the Fc fragment (Sondermann
et al. 2000), where the rigid core oligosaccharides attached to
the Fc of IgG at Asn-297 are also located (Huber et al. 1976). The
high afﬁnity of antibodies lacking core fucosylation to FcγRIIIa
is partially mediated by interactions formed between N-162 and
regions of the Fc that are accessible only when the Fc oligosac-
charide is nonfucosylated (Ferrara et al. 2006). Our data clearly
demonstrated that the glycosylation at Asn-45 in FcγRIIIa re-
duces its high binding afﬁnity mediated by N-162 to antibody
IgG1 lacking core fucosylation. The conformational change of
the D2 domain and the hinge region known to directly con-
tact IgG (Sondermann et al. 2000) might be caused by N-45
modiﬁcation of the FcγRIIIa D1 domain.

(MALDI-TOF MS) in positive-ion mode. Anti-human CD20s
have an amino acid sequence equivalent to that of rituximab,
which is widely used for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, and thus they exhibit identical binding activity
to the speciﬁc antigen on antigen-binding ELISA and ﬂow
cytometric analyses, regardless of the Fc oligosaccharide
structure (Iida et al. 2006). Antibodies were stored in a 0.01 M
citrate buffer, pH 6.0, with 0.15 M NaCl. The concentration of
puriﬁed antibodies was measured by absorbance at 280 nm.

Wild-type and oligosaccharide-depleted FcγRIIIa mutants
The hexa-His-tagged soluble human recombinant FcγRIIIa
(shFcγRIIIa-His) was prepared as described previously (Niwa,
Hatanaka, et al. 2004). Brieﬂy, the cDNA encoding FcγRIIIa
was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR (Superscript Pream-
pliﬁcation System, Invitrogen) of oligo(dT)-primed RNA from
(cid:2)
human leukocyte 5
-stretch plus cDNA library (Clontech, Palo
Alto, CA) using speciﬁc primers that generated the fragment
encoding an extracellular domain, and the transmembrane
and intracellular domains were replaced by DNA encoding a
hexa-His-tag. Using PCR with speciﬁc primers, 5

, the N-terminal amino acid of the shFcγRIIIa-His was
uniﬁed to Glu3 (residue numbers excluding the signal peptide)
by directly connecting to the signal peptide to avoid the N-
terminal amino acid heterogeneity observed in the expression
of original FcγRIIIa cDNA. Thus, the expected protein is
composed of the extracellular domain of FcγRIIIa-Val-158
(a high-afﬁnity FcγRIIIa allotype) linking hexa-His-tag at its
C-terminus Gly-175. To mutate asparagine of the FcγRIIIa
N-glycosylation sites into glutamine, a site-directed PCR
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was employed. The
constructed cDNA fragments were inserted into a mammalian
cell expression vector, pKANTEX93 (Nakamura et al. 2000),
using the EcoRI and BamHI sites. The resultant vectors
were transfected into CHO/DG44 by electroporation, and
transfectants were selected in the IMDM medium containing
500 µg/mL of G418 without hypoxanthine or thymidine. The
conﬂuent transfectants were cultured in an Ex-Cell 301 medium
(JRH Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) in the presence or absence
of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
and PMSF (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 1 week, and the expressed
proteins were puriﬁed from the culture supernatant by Ni-NTA
chromatography (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and gel ﬁltration chro-
matography using an ¨AKTA puriﬁer (Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ). Samples equilibrated with a running buffer
(0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) by a buffer exchange
with Amicon Ultra (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were loaded onto
Sephadex 75 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) at
a ﬂow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The puriﬁed proteins were stored
in the running buffer, and the puriﬁed protein concentration
was measured by absorbance at 280 nm. Their appropriate
molecular weights were conﬁrmed by SDS–PAGE (sample
buffer: 62.5 mM Tris–acetate buffer, pH 6.5 containing 12.5%
glycerol, 1% 2-ME, 2.5% SDS, and 0.005% bromphenol blue,
gel: SDS–PAGE (Atto, Tokyo, Japan)). The purity of the

132

products was estimated by SDS–PAGE analysis using a GS-800
calibrated densitometer (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

N-Terminal amino acid sequence analysis
Samples were subjected to 12% SDS–PAGE analysis, followed
by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidine diﬂuoride (PVDF)
membrane using a semidry blotting system (model AE-6675;
Atto). Each band on the PVDF membrane was excised by a
cutter and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing via
the Edman degradation method using a PPSQ-10 sequencer
(Shimazu Co., Kyoto, Japan).

IgG afﬁnity chromatography
Nonfucosylated anti-CD20 IgG1 (0.95 mg) was immobilized
onto 0.4 mL of NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE
Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
IgG1-immobilized Sepharose was washed and equilibrated
with 4 mL of running buffer, and 133 µg of puriﬁed N162-
shFcγRIIIa-His (270 µL in running buffer) was loaded onto the
◦
column. After incubation at 4
C for 1 h, 400 µL of ﬂowthrough
fraction was collected. The adsorbed materials were eluted with
a citrate-NaOH buffer, pH 4.0, after washing the column with
4 mL of the equilibration buffer. A sample (2 µg) of each frac-
tion was subjected to SDS–PAGE analysis.

FcγRIIIa-derived N-linked oligosaccharide analysis
N-Linked oligosaccharides were released by digestion of the
puriﬁed N162-shFcγRIIIa-His (60 µg) with two units of recom-
binant peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; Sigma-Aldrich) for
◦
16 h at 37
C in 0.01 M Tris–acetate buffer, pH 8.3. The re-
leased oligosaccharides were recovered after precipitation of
the protein with 75% ethanol. After the recovered supernatant
was dried, the oligosaccharides were dissolved in 13 mM acetic
acid and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The acid-treated
samples were desalted with cation-exchange resin (AG50W-X8,
hydrogen form; BioRad Laboratories) and dried in vacuum. The
dried samples were dissolved in deionized water and mixed with
a matrix to be characterized by a MALDI-TOF MS spectrom-
eter Reﬂex III (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany)
equipped with delayed extraction. The released carbohydrates
were analyzed both in a positive-ion mode using the super-DHB
solution (Bruker Daltonik) as a matrix and in a negative-ion
(cid:2)
mode using 2
-trihydroxyacetophenon (THAP) as a ma-
trix as described previously (Papac et al. 1996; Kanda et al.
2006).

IgG1-binding assay
The binding afﬁnity of anti-CD20 IgG1 to each puriﬁed
FcγRIIIa was measured by an FcγRIIIa-binding ELISA assay
using plates coated with each shFcγRIIIa-His via anti-tetra-His
antibodies (Qiagen) as described previously (Niwa, Hatanaka,
et al. 2004). The binding kinetics of IgG1 to each of the puriﬁed
shFcγRIIIa-His was measured using a T100 biosensor system
instrument (BIAcore) as follows. Anti-tetra-His antibodies were
immobilized onto the BIAcore sensor chip CM5 using an amine-
coupling kit (BIAcore) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Each shFcγRIIIa-His was captured by the immobilized
anti-tetra-His antibodies by the injection of shFcγRIIIa-His in
a HBS-EP buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Surfac-
tant P20, 0.01 M HEPES, pH 7.4) at a ﬂow rate of 5 µL/min.

The HBS-EP buffer lacking shFcγRIIIa-His was injected over
the anti-tetra-His immobilized sensor surface; samples treated
in this manner were used as a reference. The anti-CD20 IgG1
was diluted in the HBS-EP buffer at six different concentrations
(ranging from 4.17 to 133.3 nM). Each diluted IgG1 was in-
jected over the receptor-capture sensor surface at a ﬂow rate of
30 µL/min. The experiments were performed at 25
C with the
HBS-EP buffer as the running buffer. To obtain a blank control,
the buffer solution lacking IgG1 was injected over the receptor-
capture sensor surface. Prior to analysis, the data obtained by
the injection of IgG1 were corrected for the reference and blank
control. The dissociation constant (KD) for each FcγRIIIa was
calculated by steady-state analysis using the T100 biosensor
system evaluation software version 1.0 (BIAcore). To repeat
experiments, shFcγRIIIa-His and IgG1 were removed from the
sensor tips by injection of 0.01 M Glycine–HCl, pH 1.5, at a
ﬂow rate of 60 µL/min for 1 min.
