Abstract: Recent data indicates  an increasing  rate of vancomycin  resistance in  clinical enterococcal  isolates worldwide. 
The  nosocomial  enterococci  are  likely  to  harbor  virulence  elements  that  increase  their  ability  to  colonize  hospitalized 
patients.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  characterize  virulence  determinants  in  vancomycin-resistant  enterococci  (VRE) 
obtained from various clinical sources. 

During  the  years  2008  to  2010,  a  total  of  48  VRE  isolates  were  obtained  from  three  University  teaching  hospitals  in 
Northwest, Iran. Initially, phenotypic speciation was done and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of vancomycin 
were  determined  by  agar  dilution  method  and  E-test.  Then,  species  identification  and  resistance  genotypes  along  with 
detection of virulence genes (asa1, esp, gelE, ace and cpd) of the isolates were performed by multiplex PCR.  

Thirty  eight  isolates  were  identified  as  vancomycin-resistant  Enterococcus  faecium  (VREfm)  and  ten  as  E.  faecalis 
(VREfs). Irrespective of the species, vanA gene (89.58%) was dominant and three phenotypically vancomycin susceptible 
E.  faecium  isolates  carried  the  vanB  gene.  Among  virulence  genes  investigated,  the  esp  was  found  in  27(71%)  VREfm 
strains, but did not in any VREfs. Other virulence determinants were highly detected in VREfs strains. Our data indicate a 
high prevalence of E. faecium harboring vancomycin resistance with vanA genotype and the two VRE species displayed 
different virulence genes.

INTRODUCTION 

  Enterococci  are  Gram-positive  intestinal  commensals  
of  humans  and  other  animals,  in  addition  to  be  an  isolate  
from  environmental  sources.  During  the  past  decades  an 
enhancement in the prevalence of enterococal infections such 
as  bacteremia  and  urinary  tract  infections  along  with 
emergence  of  multi  antimicrobial  resistance,  particularly 
VRE has been reported worldwide [1, 2]. 

  Among  vancomycin-resistance phenotypes  in  enterococci, 
VanA and VanB possess highest clinical importance. Strains 
resistant  to  vancomycin  and  teicoplanin  were  assigned  to

VanA  phenotype  while,  those  susceptible  to  teicoplanin  but 
resistant  to  vancomycin  were  considered  as  the  VanB 
phenotype [2]. The vanA and vanB gene clusters contain nine 
different  genes  for  a  two-component  regulatory  system 
(vanR  and  vanS),  three  resistance  genes  (vanH,  encoding 
dehydrogenase;  vanA  or  vanB,  encoding  ligase;  vanX, 
encoding  DD-dipeptidase);  an  accessory  gene  (vanY);  and 
the  vanZ  gene,  which  is  present  in  the  vanA  gene  cluster 
whereas,  the  vanW  gene  is  found  only  in  the  vanB  operon. 
VanA  is  carried  on  Tn1546  whilst,  VanB  on  transposons 
Tn1547  and  Tn1549,  which  may  be  found  on  plasmids  or 
inserted on the chromosome [3]. 

  Despite the fact that E. faecalis has been observed as the 
predominant species in  clinical  infections, an  increase  in the 
prevalence  of  E.  faecium  has  been  seen  recently  [4].  This 
shift  is  likely  to  be  explained  in  part  by  the  emergence  of 
vancomycin  resistant  enterococci  (VRE)  and  E.  faecium 
being  the  dominant  detectable  species  among  them  [5].

Unfortunately, 
the  pathogenic 
mechanisms  or  virulence  factors  of  this  microorganism  [6]. 
Enterococcal  infections  may  occur  via  the  ability  to  persist 
on  harsh  environments  due  to  their  intrinsic  properties  and 
even these conditions may contribute largely to emergence of 
this  organism  as  a  nosocomial  pathogen  [7,  8].  The  process 
of  invasion  is  usually  facilitated  by  damage  to  host  tissues 
and  the  presence  of  bacterial  virulence  factors  such  as 
adhesins along with antibiotic resistance that gradually assist 
in advancement and furtive survival in newly infected place. 
At  the  next,  enterococci  utilize  several  virulence  factors  for 
adherence and colonization in the infection site by formation 
of  cell  aggregates  such  as  biofilms  [5,  9].  At  the  end, 
interactions  between  host  and  enterococci  leads  to  the 
clinical manifestation of infection in target vital tissues [5].

emergence  of  infections  and  persistence  of  enterococci  in 
nosocomial 
in  antibiotic 
resistance  and  act  as  facilities  for  emerging  infections  [10,

virulence  genes  including  asa1(aggregation  substance),  esp 
(Enterococcal  surface  protein),  gelE 
(gelatinase),  ace 
(collagen  adhesion)  and  cpd  (sex  pheromones  determinant) 
in clinical isolates of vancomycin resistant E. faecalis and E. 
faecium  at  molecular  level.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the 
first report from the Northwest of Iran.

University teaching hospitals of Tabriz (Imam Reza and Sina 
Hospitals)  and  Orumieh  (Imam  Khomeini  Hospital),  Iran, 
between  2008  and  2010.  The  origins  of  isolates  were  as 
follows:  urine  35  (72.91%),  blood  5  (10.41%),  wound 
3(6.25%),  body  fluids  4(8.33%)  and  intravenous  catheter 
1(2.08%).  Initially,  these  isolates  were  identified  to  the 
species  level  by  conventional  methods  described  previously 
[12] and then, multiplex PCR was used to detect vancomycin 
resistant  vanA  and  vanB  genes  and  also 
to  confirm 
phenotypic  speciation  by  targeting  D-alanine–  D-alanine 
ligases  specific  for  E.  faecalis  (ddlE.  faecalis)  and  E.  faecium 
(ddlE. 
faecium)  as  developed  by  Kariyama  et  al.,  [13].  E. 
faecalis E206 (vanA+) and E. faecium E2781 (vanB+) (kindly 
provided by Dr. Eimaneini) was used as control strains.  

 
For all isolates, MICs of vancomycin were determined by 
agar dilution method and E-test (BioMerieux, SA) according 
to  the  CLSI’s  (2006)  guidelines  [14]  and  manufacturer’s 
recommendations,  respectively.  E.  faecalis  ATCC  29212 
was  used  as  a  quality  control  strain  on  every  occasion  of 
susceptibility testing. 

Detection of Virulence Genes by PCR 

  DNA  extraction  was  performed  by  boiling  method  as 
described  previously  [15]  and  then  by  commercial  kit 
(DNGTM-Plus,  CinnaGen, 
Iran).  Multiplex  PCR  was 
performed  on  all  enterococcal  isolates  for  the  detection  of 
virulence  determinants  with  specific  primers  for  each  gene 
(Table  1)  with  some  modification  on  Vankerckhoven’s 
protocol  [16].  Briefly,  first  25(cid:1)l  master  mix  containing  
2.5(cid:1)l of bacterial suspension, 15pM of each primers for asa1

dGTP,  and  dTTP)  and  2.5  U  of  Taq  DNA  polymerase 
(CinnaGen, Iran). The second PCR mixture contained 10 pM 
of each primer for cpd and 4pM for ace, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 
additional  rest  of  reagents  mentioned  in  first  master  mix. 
Reactions  for  both  mixtures  were  done  on  a  thermal  cycler 
(ASTEC-Japan)  with  an  initial  denaturation  at  95°C  for  10 
min,  30  cycles  of  amplification  (denaturation  at  94°C  for  1 
min,  annealing at 56°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 
1 min), and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.  

  Amplicons  were  analyzed  on  a  1.5%  agarose  gel  and  a 
100-bp  DNA  ladder  was  used  as  the  molecular  size  marker. 
The  gels  were  stained  with  ethidium  bromide  and  photo- 
graphed  under  UV  light.  Each  PCR  assay  was  accompanied 
with  a  negative  control,  containing  all  of  the  reagents 
without template DNA. 

Statistical Analysis 

  Data were analyzed statistically using chi-square test and 
difference  was  considered  significant  at  p<0.05  by  SPSS 
software (version 18). 

RESULTS 

  Most  of  VREs  were  isolated  from  intensive  care  units 
(ICUs)  [16(33.3%)],  nephrology  [10(20.8%)]  and  internal 
[8(16.7%)]  wards.  Among  VRE  strains,  thirty-  five  E. 
faecium  harboured  vanA  gene  and  all  of  them  revealed 
MICs(cid:1)  256  (cid:2)g/ml,  except  one  (MIC=8(cid:2)g/ml).  Five  vanA 
positive 
isolates  did  not  show  any  studied  virulence 
determinants.  On  the  other  hand,  3  E.  faecium  isolates 
carried vanB  gene  with  MICs(cid:1)  4  (cid:2)g/ml  and  also,  they  were 
negative  for  all  virulence  determinants  tested.  However, 
VREfm isolates were found with the esp gene (71.05%).  

  All  E. faecalis  showed  MICs (cid:1) 256 (cid:2)g/ml  and 8 isolates 
carried vanA gene while, in the two strains, neither vanA nor 
vanB gene were detected.  

 
In  comparison  to  E.  faecium,  vancomycin  resistant  E. 
faecalis strains were furnished with diverse  combinations of 
virulence genes include: 4 strains presenting asa1, gelE, ace 
and cpd; 4 strains with asa1, gelE and  cpd; 1 strain showed 
gelE,  ace  and  cpd  and  another  one  displayed  gelE  and  cpd. 
Among  virulence  genes  studied,  concomitant  occurrence  of 
gelE  and  cpd  in  all  E.  faecalis  isolates  was  significant 
(p(cid:1)0.001). Distribution of virulence genes among vancomycin 
resistant E. faecalis and E. faecium are shown in Table 2.

DISCUSSION 

  This study investigated prevalence of virulence factors in 
vancomycin  resistant  enterococci.  The  majority  of  VREs 
were  E.  faecium  (38  out  of  48  VREs).  Similar  enhancement 
in  the  prevalence  of  VRE,  especially  E.  faecium  has  been 
noticed  earlier  in  several  studies  from  different  countries 
[17-19].  This  increase  has  been  attributed  mainly  to  the 
occurrence  and  spread  of  vanA  and  vanB  positive  VRE, 
which  exhibited  some  virulence  factors  such  as  Esp  (esp), 
cytolysin  (cyl),  hyaluronidase  (hyl)  [10].  In  comparison 
among  various  sources  of  Enterococci,  the  same  as  clinical 
samples,  farm  animals,  water  and  food  products,  isolates 
from  clinical  specimens  have  been  attributed  to  have  the 
highest  virulence  factors  [20,  21].  In  this  study,  E.  faecalis 
and  E.  faecium  strains  show  significantly  different  patterns 
in  the  incidence  of  virulence  determinants.  Similar  to  study 
of  Eaton  et  al.,  (2001),  in  our  study,  all  E.  faecalis  strains 
harbored multiple virulence determinants. 

  The  aggregation  substance  is  a  pheromone-inducible 
surface protein encoded by asa1 gene involved in adherence 
to  eukaryotic  cell  [22],  which  may  increase  the  hydro- 
phobicity  of  the  enterococcal  cell  surface  that  may  delay  or 
prevent fusion with lysosomal vesicles [23], cell aggregation 
and  conjugation  [24].  Various  reports  are  available  for  the 
prevalence  of  asa1  in  enterococcal  isolates  obtained  from 
different  sources.  In  this  study  8  out  of  10  E.  faecalis 
harbored asa1 gene and majority (62.5%) of them were being 
isolated  from  urine  specimen.  Waar  et  al.,  (2002)  reported 
high  prevalence  of  asa1  in  E.  faecalis  isolates  from  liver 
transplant  and  septicemic  patients  and  assumed  that  asa1 
might  be  associated  with  infection  [25].  Baldassarri  et  al., 
[26]  indicated  presence  of  this  gene  in  seven  out  of  11  E. 
faecalis  from  endocarditis,  with  only  one  strain  being  vanA 
positive. The present study also revealed this gene in 3 (7.89 
%) VREfm isolates from UTI, whereas other studies did not 
find asa1 in E. faecium [16, 27, 28]. A much higher incidence 
(13%)  has  been  reported  by  Elsner  et  al.,  [29]  in  clinical  
E.  faecium  isolated  from  blood  culture.  A  study  on  food  
and  medical  isolates  of  enterococci  showed  the  asa1  gene 
was  always  associated  with  the  presence  of  pheromone 
determinants  (cpd,  cob,  ccf  and  cad  )  and  only  detected  in  
E.  faecalis  [30].  Abriouel  et  al.,  (2008)  reported  high 
prevalence  of  cpd  (89.7%)  determinant  in  comparison  of 
aggregation  substance  (58.97%)  in  clinical  E.  faecalis  [28]. 
Similarly, we found the cpd gene in all VREfs, of them 80% 
were  also  asa1  positive  (p(cid:1)0.001).  Meanwhile,  we  could 
find  cpd  in  one  VREfm,  suggests  that  it  is  probably  not 
associated with virulence in this species. The presence of sex 
pheromone  determinant  in  E.  faecium  was  reported  earlier 
[31]. 

is  an  extracellular 
  Gelatinase  encoded  by  gelE 
metalloendopeptidase 
that  hydrolyzes  gelatin,  collagen, 
hemoglobin,  and  other  bioactive  compounds  [32].  Sabia  
et al., (2008) reported gelE gene in 19 (70%) out of 27 VRE 
strains;  all E.  faecalis  and  5  out  of  7  E.  faecium  carried  the 
gelE [33]. In accordance, we detected gelE gene in all VREfs 
and  7.9%  of  VREfm.  In  fact,  among  virulence  genes 
investigated,  concomitant  occurrence  of  gelE  and  cpd  in  
E.  faecalis  isolates  was  found  significant  (p(cid:1)0.001).  In 
contrast,  some  studies  did  not  find  gelE  gene  in  any  E.

faecium  isolates  [34]  while,  other  researchers  reported 
different  incidence  for  mentioned  gene  in  clinical  isolates 
[11, 27]. Silent form of this gene was reported in E. faecium 
isolates [30, 35].  

  The  ace  gene,  which  codes  for  a  putative  protein  with 
characteristics  similar  to  a  collagen-binding  protein  of 
Staphylococcus  aureus  [36]  has  been 
identified  more 
frequently  in  E.  faecalis  isolates  [27,  37].  Abriouel  et  al., 
(2008)  reported  higher  incidence  of  ace  gene  (>80%)  in 
clinical  isolates  in  comparison  to  much  lower  incidence  
or  even  absence  in  isolates  obtained  from  vegetable  foods, 
water  and  soil  [28].  The  present  study  revealed  the  ace  
gene  in  50%  of  E.  faecalis  and  only  in  one  E.  faecium.  All 
ace  positive  isolates  obtained  from  urine  (UTI)  and  isolates 
from  other  sources  were  negative  for  this  gene.  Lebreton  
et  al.,  (2009)  suggested  that  Ace  may  be  a  valuable  drug 
target  against  human  UTI.  Low  incidence  or  absence  of  
the  ace  in  clinical  E.  faecium  have  been  reported  in  some 
studies  [11,  27]  but  it  is  unlikely  to  contribute  significantly 
to virulence.  

the  primary 

surface  attachment,  contributing 

  Esp  protein  encoded  by esp  gene  assumed  to  play  a  role 
in 
to 
colonization  and  persistence  on  urinary  tract  and  biofilm 
formation  [38,  39].  The esp  is  one  of  the  disputed  virulence 
elements  that  found  on  a  pathogenicity  island  of  both  E. 
faecalis and E. faecium [40, 41].  

  Although, an earlier study demonstrated esp gene only in 
E.  faecalis  isolates  [42]  and  other  available  data  indicated 
that the esp gene was common in E. faecalis [15] however, a 
study on the food and medical isolates depicted an increasing 
incidence  of  esp  in  clinical  E.  faecium  isolates  than  E. 
faecalis  [30]  and  an  European  investigation  proposed, 
proposed  only  this  gene  for  virulence  among  this  species 
[16].  Camargo  et  al.,  (2006)  demonstrated  that  esp  (56%) 
was  restricted  to  VREfm  and  not  found  in  vancomycin 
sensitive E. faecium [43]. Vankerckhoven et al., [16] surveyed 
virulence  genes  in  European  hospitals  and  found  higher 
incidence  of  esp 
isolates.  In 
accordance  with  these  investigations,  in  our  study  esp  was 
the most common gene in VREfm (71.05%) but not detected 
in  VREfs.  Moreover,  earlier  Van  Wamel  et  al.,  (2007) 
demonstrated  that  Esp  expression  on  the  surface  of  E. 
faecium; dependent to growth condition, to vary consistently 
among  strains  and  is  quantitatively  correlated  with  initial 
adherence and biofilm formation [44].

In  the  present  study,  three  E.  faecium  isolates  with  
vanB  genotype  were  susceptible  to  vancomycin  (MIC<  4 
(cid:1)g/ml)  and  did  not  carry  any  of  examined  virulence 
determinants.  A  research  conducted  on  Australian  patients 
with haematological disorders  showed high incidence of esp 
gene in vancomycin resistant E. faecium (vanB positive), but 
all were negative for asa1 and gelE [45]. 

CONCLUSION 

  Our  data  indicate  a  high  prevalence  of  E.  faecium 
harboring  vancomycin  resistance  with  vanA  genotype.  In 
addition,  finding  of  3  E.  faecium  with  vanB  genotype,  
but  sensitive 
to  vancomycin,  suggest  application  of  
both  phenotypic  and  genotypic  methods  for  screening  

VRE  strains  since  using  them  in  single  may  lead  to 
misidentification.  

  VREfs  possessed  four  distinctive  patterns  of  virulence 
factors  and  the  gelE  gene  was  always  associated  with  the 
presence  of  pheromone  determinant  (cpd)  and 
these 
combinations  may  associate  with 
increased  virulence. 
Interestingly, esp was not found in any of VREfs strains.  

  On the other hand, the esp was the dominant determinant 
among  E.  faecium  strains.  Finding  of  esp  gene  in  high 
incidence  among  E.  faecium,  but  not  in  E.  faecalis,  may 
indicate the role of this gene in high prevalence of VREfm in 
hospitals environments. Although the gelE, cpd, asa1and ace 
genes  were  found  in  less  frequencies,  but  there  is  a  trend  of 
increasing levels of virulence genes other than esp among E. 
faecium strains.  
  Meanwhile,  in  8  of  VREfm  (3  vanB+  and  five  vanA+) 
none of these genes was present, it was concluded that other 
genes  may  be  also  important  in  the  pathogensis  of  VRE 
isolates. 

  However, further investigation is required to evaluate the 
association of these virulent determinants with occurrence of 
an infection by VREs in more number of isolates.
