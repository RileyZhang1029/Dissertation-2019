Background: Peri-implantitis (PI) is an inflammatory disease which leads to the destruction of soft and hard
tissues around osseointegrated implants. The subgingival microbiota appears to be responsible for peri-
implant lesions and although the complexity of the microbiota has been reported in PI, the microbiota
responsible for PI has not been identified.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify the microbiota in subjects who have PI, clinically healthy
implants, and periodontitis-affected teeth using 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis to clarify the microbial
differences.
Design: Three subjects participated in this study. The conditions around the teeth and implants were
evaluated based on clinical and radiographic examinations and diseased implants, clinically healthy implants,
and periodontally diseased teeth were selected. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest
pockets using sterile paper points. Prevalence and identity of bacteria was analyzed using a 16S rRNA gene
clone library technique.
Results: A total of 112 different species were identified from 335 clones sequenced. Among the 112 species, 51
(46%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 22 were novel phylotypes. The numbers of bacterial species
identified at the sites of PI, periodontitis, and periodontally healthy implants were 77, 57, and 12, respectively.
Microbiota in PI mainly included Gram-negative species and the composition was more diverse when
compared to that of the healthy implant and periodontitis. The phyla Chloroflexi, Tenericutes, and
Synergistetes were only detected at PI sites, as were Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus stomatis,
Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and Solobacterium moorei. Low levels of periodontopathic bacteria, such
as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were seen in peri-implant lesions.
Conclusions: The biofilm in PI showed a more complex microbiota when compared to periodontitis and
periodontally healthy teeth, and it was mainly composed of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Common
periodontopathic bacteria showed low prevalence, and several bacteria were identified as candidate pathogens
in PI.

Osseointegrated titanium implants have become an

important alternative to conventional prostheses
for the replacement of missing teeth (1, 2). On the
other hand, with the increasing demand for dental
implants, dental implant failure is also being reported
more frequently (38). Peri-implantitis (PI) is an inflam-
matory disease affecting soft and hard tissues around the
osseointegrated implants, which can cause an early

implant failure (911). Several factors, such as bacterial
infection and/or excessive occlusal stress, are associated
with the occurrence of the disease and the microbiological
factors of PI have been of particular interest (1113).
After the insertion of titanium implants, rapid coloniza-
tion of bacteria has been observed at the peri-implant
sulcus (14). Some microbiological studies have shown that
implants affected by PI tend to harbor microbiota

encompassing periodontal pathogen species,
including
Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Aggrega-
tibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia,
and Fusobacterium species (1520). Leonhardt et al. (17)
also reported that less common oral species, such as
staphylococci, enteric species, and yeasts, were recovered
from failing implants. These findings indicate the com-
plexity of the microbiota in PI and the species responsible
for PI remain unclear. It is also possible that unknown
bacteria are involved in the lesions. As pockets around the
remaining teeth may act as a bacterial reservoir, the
composition of the peri-implant microbiota is likely to
be similar to that around teeth. However, few studies have
evaluated the differences in bacterial composition be-
tween dental implants and remaining teeth in the same
subjects.

In a recent study, molecular techniques such as
chain reaction
oligonucleotide probes, polymerase
(PCR), and checkerboard DNADNA hybridization
have been applied to identify the bacteria in PI (2025).
However, these approaches only detect specific target
bacteria and are not practical for identifying the true
diversity of potential pathogens in the pockets of PI. In
contrast, PCR amplification of conserved regions of the
16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene followed by clone
library construction has been used to comprehensively
identify various microbiotas. This approach allows the
detection of almost every species in a given sample and is
able to indicate the presence of previously uncultivated
and unknown bacteria (26).

The aim of this study was to determine the microbiota
in subjects with PI, clinical healthy implants, and period-
ontal teeth using 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis,
and to clarify the microbial differences.

Materials and methods

Subjects and clinical examination
Three subjects with PI, a clinically healthy implant, and a
periodontally diseased tooth were selected. Subjects were
non-smokers and in good general health. They had not
received systemic antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, or
oral anti-microbial agents within the last 3 months. The
investigation was approved by the Ethics Committee of
the Tokyo Medical and Dental University, and a written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

Clinical examinations were performed for the selected
teeth and implants. The following clinical parameters
were assessed at six sites per tooth and at six sites per
implant (mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual,
lingual, and distolingual): (1) probing depth (PD), (2)
bleeding on probing (BOP), (3) suppuration (SUP), and
(4) Gingival Index (GI) (27). Intra-oral periapical radio-
graphs (Insight dental films, Eastman Kodak Company,
SP, Japan) were obtained using the parallel technique.

Radiographs were analyzed for peri-implant bone loss by
the same examiner using the smooth components and
threads of the implants as reference points. Based on
clinical and radiographic data, a diseased implant, a
clinically healthy implant, and a periodontally diseased
tooth were selected for plaque sampling in each subject.
Diseased implants (implants with PI) showed PD]5 mm
with BOP and/or SUP and concomitant radiographic
bone loss (bone loss more than three threads up to half
of the implant length). Healthy implants (H) showed
PDB4 mm without BOP and SUP, and radiographic
bone loss. All implants for sampling were treated as single
stand prostheses. Periodontally diseased teeth (P) showed
PD]4 mm with BOP.

Sample collection and bacterial DNA isolation
Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from the
deepest pockets at the implants with/without PI. In
addition, samples from the deepest pockets of
the
periodontally diseased tooth, not adjacent to the implant
were collected. Two weeks before sampling, we performed
periodontal examination for all of the residual teeth and
implants. PD, BOP, and SUP were measured at six points
per
tooth as pre-examination and together with
radiographic evaluation, sampling sites were decided.
Sampling sites were isolated with sterile cotton rolls.
Supragingival plaque was removed with sterile cotton
pellets. Three paper points were inserted into a pocket
until resistance was felt. After 30 s, all paper points were
removed and placed in a sterile tube with 1 ml of sterile
distilled water.

Samples were mixed for 1 min using a vortex mixer.
After removing the paper point, each sample was
collected by centrifugation at 12,000g for 5 min. The
resulting pellet was resuspended in 150 ml of lysis buffer
from a bacterial DNA extraction kit (Mora-extract,
AMR Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Samples were then incubated
for 10 min at 908C and total bacterial genomic DNA was
isolated using the Mora-extract kit. Total bacterial DNA
was eluted with 200 ml of TE buffer (AMR Inc.) and was
stored at 208C.

16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene clone library
analysis
16S rRNA gene clone library analysis was performed as
described previously (28, 29). Briefly, the primers used
for PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were 27F
(5?-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3?) and 1492R (5?-
TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3?). PCR reaction
mixture (100 ml) containing 10 ml of extracted DNA,
2.5 U of TaKaRa Ex taq† (TAKARA BIO Inc., Otsu,
Japan), 10 ml of 10Ex Taq buffer, 8 ml of dNTP mixture
(0.2 mM each), and 50 pmol of each primer. PCR
amplification was performed using a Veriti 200 PCR
Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,

USA) with the following program; 958C for 3 min,
followed by 15 cycles of 958C for 30 s, 508C for 30 s,
728C for 1.5 min and a final extension period of 728C for
10 min. PCR products were purified using a QIAquick
PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).

Purified amplicons were ligated into plasmid vector
pCR†2.1 and then transformed into One Shot† INVaF?
competent cells using the Original TA Cloning kit
(Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). Plasmid DNAs
were prepared using the TempliPhi DNA Amplification
Kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) from ran-
domly selected recombinants and used as templates for
sequencing. Sequencing was conducted using the 27F and
520R primers, a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems), and a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems).

All sequences were checked for possible chimeric
artifacts by the Chimera Check program of the Riboso-
mal Database Project-II (RDP-II) and compared to
similar sequences of the reference organisms by BLAST
search (30). A 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98%
was used as the cut-off for positive identification of taxa
(operational taxonomic unit  OTU). Less than 98%
identity in the 16S rRNA gene sequence was the criterion
used to identify bacteria at
the species level. The
sequences were aligned with the Clustal X 2.0.12 program
(31) and corrected by manual
inspection. Nucleotide
substitution rates (Knuc values) were calculated (32) after
gaps and unknown bases were eliminated. The phyloge-
netic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining
method (33). Bootstrap resampling analysis (34) was
performed to estimate the confidence of tree topologies.
Sequences for novel phylotypes were deposited in the
DDBJ database under accession numbers AB538407 to
AB538428.

Libraries were analyzed using the Mothur program
v.1.7.2 (35). Distance matrices were calculated using the
Dnadist program within the PHYLIP software package
version 3.69. The Shannon index was used to measure
community diversity. The Chao1 index was applied to
measure community richness.

Results
Clinical data of subjects and sites selected for bacterial
sampling are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
A total of nine sites (three PI, three periodontitis, and
three healthy implants) were selected and collected for
subgingival plaque samples. One sample (periodontally
healthy implant) was missed in the process of sample
preparation, so eight samples were analyzed. A total of
335 sequences from eight samples were subjected to
sequence analysis, which revealed 112 species; 51 (46%)
were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 22 were novel.
The total numbers of bacterial species identified at the
sites of PI, periodontitis, and periodontally healthy
implants were 77, 57, and 12, respectively. Each clone

was classified into several clusters corresponding to
phylum-level classification (Table 3, Fig. 1). Microbiota
of PI primarily included Gram-negative species and the
composition was more diverse than that for healthy
implants or periodontitis. Chloroflexi, Tenericutes, and
Synergistetes phyla were only detected at PI sites. Also
Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Pseudor-
amibacter alactolyticus, and Solobacterium moorei were
only observed at PI sites. Fusobacterium nucleatum was
identified at all of the PI sites and Granulicatella adiacens
was identified at two thirds of PI sites; these two species
were also detected at periodontitis sites but not at healthy
implants. Most of the bacterial species found in the
healthy implants were also detected in the PI and
periodontitis sites.

When the diversity and richness of

the resident
bacterial species were compared between PI and period-
ontitis, higher values for the Shannon index and richness
were observed at PI sites (Table 4), thus suggesting that
the bacterial community at PI sites were more diverse
when compared to periodontitis.

Discussion
In the present study, we identified the bacteria that
compose biofilm at sites with PI. It is believed that the
source of infecting bacteria on implants is mainly plaque
from residual teeth or saliva, and that microbiota around
the implants tend to be similar to that of residual teeth
(3638). The periodontal status of remaining teeth would
thus determine the bacterial composition at PI sites
(37, 38). Our results show that some Streptococcus spp.
and F. nucleatum are common to sites with periodontitis
and PI. Sites with PI tend to show a more complex
microbiota when compared to periodontitis/healthy im-
plant sites and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria are
particularly common at such sites.

The presence of periodontopathic bacteria is generally
considered to be a risk factor for PI, and indeed, many
studies have reported the high prevalence of bacteria,
such as P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans in PI
lesions (1520). In contrast, several researchers have
argued that PI and/or implant failure does not always
harbor periodontopathic bacteria (3941). F. nucleatum is
reported to be a pathogen involved in periodontitis and
was found at all PI sites in the present study. However, we
were unable to confirm the high prevalence of other
periodontopathic bacteria in peri-implant/periodontal
lesions. It should be emphasized that the sample size
was limited and our results do not rule out an association
between ‘established’ periodontopathic bacteria and PI.
Although numerous species reside in peri-implant lesions
when compared to periodontitis sites, potentially impor-
tant bacteria may have been overlooked as disease
pathogens. To our knowledge, this is the first study using
the 16S rRNA gene clone library technique to analyze the
microbiota in PI, to confirm that the biofilm of PI is
composed of a greater variety of bacterial species when
compared to periodontitis. Bacteria isolated only in PI,
such as P. micra, P. stomatis, and P. alactolyticus, have
in periodontal and/or
been reported to be present
endodontal
these
bacteria are difficult to grow in culture, they have not
yet been characterized by their bacterial properties. Also
the Chloroflexi, Tenericutes, and Synergistetes phyla were
only detected at PI sites. This is in contrast to Vartoukian
et al. (44) who reported a high prevalence of the phylum
‘Synergistetes’ in both periodontitis and healthy subjects.
We considered that the discrepancy of the results was

3), further studies are necessary for clarifying the role of
the phylum Synergistetes in peri-implant diseases, more-
over for other bacteria.

Differences in bacterial diversity between PI and
periodontitis lesions may be explained by the character-
istics of surfaces to which the bacteria adhere. Surface
roughness and free energy (wettability) are thought to
have a significant impact on biofilm formation (45) and
the higher levels of free energy on the implant surfaces are
likely to affect biofilm components.

In conclusion, PI biofilms showed a more complex
microbiota when compared to periodontitis and period-
ontally healthy implants, and were mainly composed of
Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Previously established
periodontopathic bacteria showed low prevalence and
several bacteria were identified as candidate of pathogens
in PI, although it is unclear whether the importance of
these species is higher when compared to established
periodontopathic bacteria.
