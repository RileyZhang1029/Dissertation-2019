Geochemical, molecular, and physiological analyses of microbial isolates were combined to
study the geomicrobiology of acidic iron oxide mats inYellowstone National Park. Nineteen
sampling locations from 11 geothermal springs were studied ranging in temperature from
53 to 88˚C and pH 2.4 to 3.6. All iron oxide mats exhibited high diversity of crenarchaeal
sequences from the Sulfolobales, Thermoproteales, and Desulfurococcales. The predom-
inant Sulfolobales sequences were highly similar to Metallosphaera yellowstonensis str.
MK1, previously isolated from one of these sites. Other groups of archaea were consis-
tently associated with different types of iron oxide mats, including undescribed members
of the phyla Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota. Bacterial sequences were dominated
by relatives of Hydrogenobaculum spp. above 65–70˚C, but increased in diversity below
60˚C. Cultivation of relevant iron-oxidizing and iron-reducing microbial isolates included Sul-
folobus str. MK3, Sulfobacillus str. MK2, Acidicaldus str. MK6, and a new candidate genus
in the Sulfolobales referred to as Sulfolobales str. MK5. Strains MK3 and MK5 are capable
of oxidizing ferrous iron autotrophically, while strain MK2 oxidizes iron mixotrophically. Sim-
ilar rates of iron oxidation were measured for M. yellowstonensis str. MK1 and Sulfolobales
str. MK5. Biomineralized phases of ferric iron varied among cultures and ﬁeld sites, and
included ferric oxyhydroxides, K-jarosite, goethite, hematite, and scorodite depending on
geochemical conditions. Strains MK5 and MK6 are capable of reducing ferric iron under
anaerobic conditions with complex carbon sources. The combination of geochemical and
molecular data as well as physiological observations of isolates suggests that the commu-
nity structure of acidic Fe mats is linked with Fe cycling across temperatures ranging from
53 to 88˚C.

INTRODUCTION
Ferric iron oxyhydroxide and jarositic microbial mats are found in
numerous environments and have been well studied in acid-mine-
drainage systems such as Iron Mountain, CA, USA (Edwards et al.,
1999; Singer et al., 2008) where Fe(II) and H2SO4 are produced
during the oxidation of sulﬁde minerals such as pyrite and chal-
copyrite (Nordstrom and Southam, 1997; Rohwerder et al., 2003).
The phylogenetic diversity of microbial populations in acidic sys-
tems has been reviewed and acidophiles that respire on Fe(III)
have been identiﬁed in various mesophilic systems (Blake and
Johnson, 2000; Hallberg and Johnson, 2001; Baker and Banﬁeld,
2003; Johnson and Hallberg, 2009). Microbial populations and
description of novel species from thermo-acidophilic, iron-rich
environments have also been studied (Johnson et al., 2003, 2006;

Macur et al., 2004; Inskeep et al., 2005, 2010; Kozubal et al., 2008).
Ferric iron mats from acidic geothermal springs in Yellowstone
National Park (YNP) provide an outstanding natural laboratory
to study thermophilic microorganisms that utilize ferrous iron
for energy acquisition coupled to CO2 ﬁxation as their primary
carbon source. Their ability to thrive in high-temperature environ-
ments with minimal requirements other than CO2 and inorganic
constituents suggests that these organisms are important primary
producers in acidic high-temperature environments. However, the
limited energy available from the oxidation of Fe(II) results in the
formation of copious amounts of iron oxides. It has been esti-
mated that at pH 2, ∼120 mol of Fe(II) must be oxidized for the
formation of 1 mol of glucose (Konhauser, 2007). Thus, low cell
numbers can result in the oxidation of large amounts of iron,

which has implications in understanding the biomineralization
of iron in many environments outside YNP, as well as through-
out Earth’s evolutionary history (e.g., banded iron formations;
Konhauser, 1998; Kappler and Straub, 2005).
Rates of abiotic Fe(II)-oxidation are slow at pH values less than
4.5 [1× 10
−1; Singer and Stumm, 1970]; there-
fore, acidophilic microbes have an advantage over neutrophiles
by not having to compete for rapid abiotic oxidation of Fe(II).
Biologically oxidized Fe(II) often accumulates as ferric oxide
minerals, which range in thickness and hardness depending on
the geochemistry, ﬂow rate, and microbial populations present
(Konhauser, 1998; Inskeep et al., 2004). Solid phase geochemi-
cal analyses have been conducted on several ferric iron mats in
YNP including 2–4 cm thick amorphous Fe-oxide mats from an
acid-sulfate-chloride (ASC) spring (pH ∼3) in the Norris Geyser
Basin (NGB) region as well as more crystalline ferric oxides (i.e.,
goethite, hematite) and jarosite from an acid-sulfate (AS) system
located at the Rainbow Springs region (Inskeep et al., 2005). How-
ever, new results from synchrotron Fe-extended-X-ray absorption
ﬁne-structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analyses across a greater number of Fe-oxide mats are presented in
the current study and integrated with aqueous geochemical data
and microbial community structure to understand factors control-
ling Fe-biomineralization across different acidic high-temperature
environments.

Previous work has also described the microbial diversity in sev-
eral low pH, iron-rich geothermal springs in the NGB, Joseph’s
Coat Hot Springs, and Rainbow Hot Springs regions of YNP (Jack-
son et al., 2001; Inskeep et al., 2004, 2005; Macur et al., 2004).
However, these studies were based primarily on a relatively small
number of shorter-length 16S rRNA gene sequences from a few
sampling locations. Therefore, a primary aim of this study is to
present more comprehensive data on the microbial diversity from
numerous acidophilic ferric mats in YNP over a wide variety of
environmental conditions (T = 53–88˚C; pH= 2.4–3.6), includ-
ing a larger library of 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from
“next-generation” pyrotag and community shotgun sequencing
efforts.

Phylogenetic similarity of observed sequences from molecu-
lar studies to cultivated microorganisms (16S rRNA gene) is not
sufﬁcient to deﬁnitively link microbial metabolism(s) to speciﬁc
geochemical cycles especially when 16S rRNA gene sequences are
highly divergent from those of cultured organisms (e.g., <90%
similarity). Therefore, the cultivation of relevant organisms from
these habitats is also critical for implicating speciﬁc microorgan-
isms and their corresponding metabolic pathways in biogeochem-
ical processes. For example, we recently reported the isolation
of a new Sulfolobales isolate from YNP ferric iron mats, Metal-
losphaera yellowstonensis str. MK1, an iron and sulfur-oxidizing
chemolithoautotroph (Kozubal et al., 2008). Quantitative analy-
sis of Metallosphaera-like 16S rRNA sequences demonstrated that
organisms highly similar (>99%) to strain MK1 comprised up to
80% of the total archaeal community in various YNP ferric iron
habitats.

The geothermal springs discussed in this study are highly
reduced at the source and Fe(II)-oxidizing microbial communi-
ties do not occur until the springs have sufﬁcient dissolved oxygen

from atmospheric mixing, after dissolved sulﬁde has degassed.
Previous quantitative expression results show that the M. yel-
lowstonensis foxA-J gene cluster is important for Fe(II) oxidation
in pure culture and in situ (Kozubal et al., 2011). The fox gene
cluster is found in all iron-oxidizing Crenarchaeota (i.e., Sul-
folobus metallicus, Sulfolobus tokodaii, and Metallosphaera spp.)
and potential mechanisms for Fe(II) oxidation via Fox proteins
have been hypothesized (Kozubal et al., 2011). It is not currently
known how widespread this gene complex may be in other mem-
bers of the Sulfolobales found in Fe-oxide mats, and/or in other
archaea.

The primary goal of this study was to couple geochemical
processes with microbial community analysis to understand mech-
anisms of Fe(II)-oxidation and secondary solid phase formation in
acidic outﬂow channels of YNP geothermal springs. The speciﬁc
objectives were to (i) determine in situ Fe(II) oxidation rates and
identify predominant secondary minerals formed across a range
of environmental conditions (T = 53–88˚C; pH= 2.4–3.6), (ii)
identify the predominant community members of different high-
temperature ferric iron microbial mats, (iii) characterize novel
Fe-active isolates determined to be relevant in situ populations
using molecular surveys, and (iv) present genomic evidence for
iron and sulfur oxidation in a novel Sulfolobales isolate (strain
MK5), as well as from site metagenomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DESCRIPTION OF SITES
Eleven geothermal springs in Yellowstone National Park were cho-
sen for this study and include eight acid-sulfate-chloride springs
(ASC) in NGB, and three acid-sulfate springs (AS) springs from
Joseph’s Coat and Rainbow Springs (Figure 1). Each spring was
sampled at multiple locations based on transects established
within the main ﬂow channel as a function of distance (tempera-
ture) from the outﬂow source (selected sites shown in Figure 2).
The ASC springs sampled include “OSP Spring ” (NGB-OSP),
“Beowulf Spring ” (NGB-BE, NGB-BW), “Gap Spring ” (NGB-
GAP), Echinus Geyser (NGB-EG), Whirligig Geyser (NGB-WG),
“Grendel Spring ” (NGB-GRN), and “Porcelain Basin” (NGB-PB;
names in quotations are not ofﬁcial YNP names). Acid-sulfate
springs included an unnamed spring at Joseph’s Coat Hot Springs
(JC2) and two unnamed springs at Rainbow Springs (RS2 and
RS3).

DNA EXTRACTION AND 16S rRNA SEQUENCING
The distribution and relative abundance of total archaeal and
bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were examined using micro-
bial mat samples obtained with sterile tools and collection tubes
and immediately placed on dry ice for transport to a −80˚C
freezer. Samples were obtained over a 5-year period from July
2003 to July 2008. Total DNA was extracted from ﬁeld sam-
ples (or pure cultures) using a FastDNA SPIN kit for soil (Q-
Biogene, Irvine, CA, USA). The nearly full-length 16S rRNA
gene PCR primers included the Bacteria-speciﬁc primer Bac8f

50-μL PCR mixture contained 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 50 mM
KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4.0 mM MgCl2, each deoxynucleoside
triphosphate at a concentration of 800 μM, 0.5 μL of each primer,
1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA),
and 1–5 μL of template DNA (2–20 ng). The thermal cycler proto-
col was 94˚C for 6 min, 25–35 cycles of 94˚C for 45 s, 54˚C for45 s,
and 72˚C for 110 s, and a ﬁnal 7-min extension at 72˚C. Nega-
tive control reactions (no template) were routinely performed to
ensure purity. The puriﬁed PCR products were cloned using the
pGEM-T vector system from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI, USA),
and the inserts were ampliﬁed and sequenced (TGEN, Phoenix,
AZ, USA, and the Ohio State Plant Genomics Facility, Columbus,
OH, USA).

In addition to clone sequences obtained from the method
described above, a total of 1348 near full-length 16S rRNA
gene sequences were obtained from the Joint Genome Institute

case). In addition, the reverse primer included a 5-bp barcode
for multiplexing of samples during sequencing. Twenty-microliter
PCR reactions were performed in duplicate and pooled to min-
imize PCR bias using 0.4 μL Advantage GC 2 Polymerase Mix
(Advantage-2 GC PCR Kit, Clonetech), 4 μL 5X GC PCR buffer,
2 μL 5 M GC Melt Solution, 0.4 μL 10 mM dNTP mix (MBI Fer-
mentas), 1.0 μL of each 25 nM primer, and 10 ng sample DNA.
The thermal cycler protocol was 95˚C for 3 min, 25 cycles of 95˚C
for 30 s, 50˚C for45 s, and 68˚C for 90 s, and a ﬁnal 10-min exten-
sion at 68˚C. PCR Amplicons were puriﬁed using SPRI Beads and
quantiﬁed using a Qubit ﬂuorometer (Invitrogen). Samples were
diluted to 10 ng/μL and mixed in equal concentrations. Emul-
sion PCR and sequencing of the PCR amplicons were performed
following the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium technology manu-
facturer’s instructions. Sequencing tags were analyzed using the
software tool PyroTagger (http://pyrotagger.jgi-psf.org) using a
180-bp sequence length threshold as described in Engelbrektson
et al. (2010). The 97% operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were
also taxonomically classiﬁed by Blastn against a curated database
of >1500 full-length 16S rRNA sequences from the actual sites that
exhibited high nucleotide similarity (>96% of reads were 99.5%
similar to prior long-fragment sequences).

CULTIVATION OF MICROORGANISMS FROM Fe MICROBIAL MATS
Approximately 2 g of Fe-oxide microbial mat from NGB-BE, NGB-
GAPA, and NB-OSPB was placed into 60 mL serum bottles with
synthetic growth medium as described by Kozubal et al. (2008)
at sampling times between August 2003 and August 2008. Isola-
tion of Sulfobacillus str. MK2 colonies was obtained by streaking
∼0.5 mL of NGB-BE slurry on 1.5% agar plates in synthetic media
with 0.5% yeast extract and 10 mM FeSO4. Plates were incubated
at 58˚C for up to 12 days. Colonies were transferred to serum bottle
cultures with 10 mM FeSO4, 0.2% YE in synthetic media for fur-
ther study. Pure cultures of Acidicaldus str. MK6 and Sulfolobales
sp. strain MK5 were obtained by streaking ∼0.5 mL of OSPB slurry
on 1.2% Gelrite® plates in media described by Itoh et al. (2001)
with 2 mM FeSO4. Plates were incubated at 65˚C for up to 15 days.
Pure colonies of Acidicaldus str. MK6 were transferred to serum
bottle cultures with synthetic media and 0.05% YE for further
studies. Sulfolobus str. MK3 was obtained by dilution to extinction
with 2% pyrite in synthetic media by the method described for
Metallosphaera str. MK1 (Kozubal et al., 2008), except inoculum
was obtained from GAPA and cultures were incubated at 75˚C.
The progress of all cultures was monitored by extracting DNA
from the serum bottles, followed by PCR ampliﬁcation of 16S
rRNA genes using universal bacterial and archaeal primers and
separation and visualization of the PCR products using denatur-
ing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE; Macur et al., 2004). The
purity of cultures was also conﬁrmed by cloning and sequencing
of near full-length16S rRNA gene fragments.

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES
Near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from
cloning were compared to sequences in public databases using
the “Blastn” algorithm. Sequence alignments were performed
using ClustalX (Version 1.83) and phylogenetic trees were
constructed using the Maximum Likelihood method (MEGA

5.0) with 1000 boot straps (Tamura et al., 2011). Accession
numbers
for all 16S rRNA gene sequences discussed in
the current study were deposited with NCBI [Sulfobacillus
str. MK2 (DQ350778), Sulfolobus str. MK3 (JN944177), Sul-
folobales
str. MK6
(JQ247723)].

ISOLATE GROWTH CHARACTERISTICS
Temperature and pH optima were determined for all isolates in
20 mL serum bottles with 5 mL headspace composed of 30% O2,
50% CO2, and 20% N2. Heterotrophic growth was determined
with the addition of 0.5% yeast extract (YE); autotrophic growth
with either 2% pyrite, 2% S0, or 5 mM Fe(II)SO4 without added
carbon; and mixotrophic growth with 5 mM Fe(II)SO4 and 0.5%
YE. Anaerobic growth was evaluated using Fe(III) as a primary
electron acceptor in 20 mL serum bottles with 15 mL of synthetic
media, 0.5 g of dried, double-autoclaved NGB-BE mat (120˚C),
10 mM glucose, and 0.5% YE. Serum bottle cultures were sealed
and purged with N2 gas for 20 min to obtain sub-oxic conditions.

IRON OXIDATION AND REDUCTION RATES
Iron oxidation rates were determined for Metallosphaera str. MK1
and Sulfolobales str. MK5 in 120 mL serum bottles with 1 g of
crushed and dried, triple autoclaved NGB-BE HFO mat and 60 mL
of BED synthetic media with 10 mM FeSO4 without added carbon
and a headspace composed of 50% O2 and 50% CO2. Oxida-
tion rates of Fe(II) were determined with an initial cell culture of
∼106 cells/mL added at exponential growth phase. Abiotic Fe(II)-
oxidation rates were determined with un-inoculated controls.
Fe(II) was measured on 1 mL ﬁltered (0.2 micron ﬁlters) samples
using the ferrozine method (To et al., 1999) on late exponen-
tial/lag phase cultures after the addition of 10 mM Fe(II). Samples
were taken every 10 min for four hours after cell culture density
reached 108 cells/mL. Culture density was measured by counting
SYBR gold staining. Rates were reported as femtomoles Fe(II)
per liter per second per cell after correcting for abiotic oxidation
[0.025 μmol Fe(II) L

−1].

−1 s

Iron reduction rates were determined for Acidicaldus str. MK6
and Sulfolobales str. MK5 in 120 mL serum bottles with 80 mL
of synthetic medium, 10 mM glucose as the electron donor and
1-g triple autoclaved Fe(III)-oxide mat from NGB-BE, which has
been previously characterized (Inskeep et al., 2004). Serum bottles
were purged with N2(g) for 20 min prior to inoculation. Sam-
ples were inoculated to an initial concentration of 105 cells/mL
and 1 mL ﬁltered samples were taken twice daily for 10 days
and analyzed for Fe(II) as stated above. Cell concentrations were
determined by SYBR gold staining and reduction rates were cal-
culated on late exponential/lag phase cultures after cell culture
densities reached 108 cells/mL and reported as femtomoles Fe(III)
per liter per second per cell [abiotic Fe(III)-reduction rates were
negligible].

SOLID PHASE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
Solid phase analysis was performed on ﬁeld samples and secondary
phases obtained from Metallosphaera str. MK1 and Sulfolobales
str. MK5 culture vessels after 11 days of incubation in Beowulf
spring water and 2% ground pyrite at 65˚C and pH 3.0. Strain MK1

culture vessels contained two distinct iron oxide phases including
a dark-red phase around the glass vessel at the air/water interface
and an off-yellow phase forming just below the air-water interface.
Approximately 0.5–1 g of each phase was scraped from the bottles
and analyzed by XRD or X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).

Iron EXAFS spectra were collected at beamline 11-2 at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. A double crystal
Si(220) monochromator was used for energy selection. Scans
were conducted from 100 eV below to 1000 eV above the Fe-
K-edge at 7111 eV. Iron ﬂuorescence spectra were averaged and
normalized to unity using the XAS data reduction software SIX-
PACK (Webb, 2011). SIXPACK/IFEFFIT algorithms were used
to isolate backscattering contributions by subtracting a spline
function from the EXAFS data region. The resulting function
−1, weighted by k3,
was then converted from units of eV to Å
−1 Linear combination of model
and windowed from 3 to 14 Å
compounds was performed to reconstruct unknown spectra; no
more than four standards were varied at a time. Model com-
pound (standards) contributions were deemed signiﬁcant if their
mole percentage was greater than 10%. Model compounds used
for linear combination Fe-EXAFS ﬁtting included two-line fer-
rihydrite sorbed to quartz sand, Si-substituted ferrihydrite, six-
line ferrihydrite,
lepidocrocite, goethite, hematite, potassium-
jarosite, scorodite, synthetic and natural siderite, vivianite, mag-
netite, green rust phases (chloride, sulfate, carbonate), and amor-
phous FeS. Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction was performed
at 12,735 eV at beamline 11-3 (SSRL), with an energy resolu-
tion (ΔE/E) of ∼5× 10
−4 equipped with a Si(311) monochro-
mator and a MAR345 CCD detector. Finely crushed samples
were placed between two polycarbonate windows to a nomi-
nal thickness of 100 μm and mounted in an aluminum sam-
ple holder. Patterns were energy calibrated using a lanthanum
hexaboride standard. Resulting powder diffraction images were
radially integrated, converted to d-space vs. relative intensity,
and analyzed for mineral phases using JADE 6.0 (Materials
Data, Inc.).

MICROSCOPY
Optical images were obtained utilizing a Zeiss epiﬂuorescence
microscope (Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
Samples were stained with 10X SYBR-green for ﬂuorescent images.
Environmental samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images were stored at 4˚C prior to analysis. Samples were ana-
lyzed with either a SEM with cryostage or a ﬁeld emission-
scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), both equipped with
an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) for elemental
analysis.

RESULTS
GEOCHEMISTRY OF ACIDIC Fe-OXIDIZING SPRINGS IN YNP
The major electron donors, pH, oxygen concentration, temper-
ature, and solid phase geochemistry of three acid-sulfate (AS;
JC2, RS2, RS3) and eight acid-sulfate-chloride (ASC) geothermal
springs (NGB-OSP, NGB-BE, NGB-BW, NGB-GAP, NGB-WG,
NGB-EG, NGB-PB, NGB-GRN) are summarized across a total of
19 sampling positions (Table 1). The common geochemical prop-
erties across this group of thermophilic sites include pH (2.4–3.6),

+

+

ferrous Fe (∼30–240 μM), and dissolved oxygen (20–100 μM).
The concentrations of other reduced constituents including arsen-
ite, ammonium, dissolved hydrogen, and dissolved methane can
be signiﬁcant; however, the dissolved sulﬁde levels of Fe-oxide
depositional zones are generally <5–10 μM. Although the con-
centrations of ammonium (NH4
) are ∼20–30 times higher in
AS springs compared to ASC springs, no consistent changes in
NH4
were observed as a function of distance from the spring
source, regardless of total NH4 concentration. Ferrous Fe repre-
sents the majority of total dissolved Fe at the point of discharge
for nearly all springs sampled. Moreover, total soluble Fe did
not decline signiﬁcantly with distance (in some cases FeTS can
decrease by 10–20%), indicating that the deposition rates of sec-
ondary Fe(III) phases are considerably slower than the total ﬂux
of Fe(II). However, the amount of ferrous Fe decreased sub-
stantially in acid-sulfate springs [JC2, RS2; e.g., levels of Fe(II)
decline from 81 to 34 μM in RS2] matching the production
of soluble ferric Fe (Figure 3), whereas ferric Fe remained low
in ASC springs containing high concentrations of arsenic (e.g.,
>20 μM).

The short residence times between sampling positions in JC2
and RS2 (e.g., JC2A to JC2D is 35 s), combined with the amount of
Fe(II)-oxidized results in very high rate constants for the oxidation
of Fe(II) (Figure 3). A second spring source emerges at sampling
position JC2E where Fe(II) is reset to near 100% of the total dis-
solved iron, and ∼43% is oxidized to Fe(III) by sampling point
JC2F, a 32-s residence time. Measurements of channel velocities
and estimates of total ﬂow rate were used to approximate in situ
iron oxidation rates in outﬂow channels of JC2 and RS2. The aver-
age rates of Fe(II) oxidized within JC2, RS2, and BE Springs ranged
from 0.5 to 1.3, 0.2 to 2, and 0.1 to 0.2 μM Fe(II) oxidized/second,
respectively (Figure 3).

Solid phase analysis was completed for iron oxide mat samples
from all sites discussed in the current study except Grendel Spring
(Table 1; Figure 4). XRD and SEM/EDAX data from OSP Spring
and Whirligig Geyser in NGB are similar to those found previ-
ously from Beowulf Spring (Inskeep et al., 2004) and show high
levels of arsenate sorbed to amorphous ferrihydrite-like phases
(As:Fe= 0.6–0.7). Solid phases from Echinus Geyser (Figure 4)
are characterized by more crystalline ferrihydrite phase with lower
sorbed arsenate, which is not surprising given the lower arsenic

concentrations (Table 1). Scorodite (FeIIIAsO4·2H2O) was the

dominant phase detected using XRD in the higher temperature
(85˚C) Fe mats of Porcelain Basin and to a lesser extent in GAP
Spring.

The lower pH acid-sulfate systems (e.g., JC2, RS2) con-
tain higher concentrations of Fe(II), but lower levels of arsenic
(Table 1). Solid phase analyses (XRD, XAS) indicate more crys-
talline phases including jarosite [KFe3(OH)6(SO4)2], goethite, and
hematite within the outﬂow channels of RS2 and JC2, respectively
(Table 1; Figure 4). These systems contain higher concentrations
of sulfate, potassium, and total soluble Fe than sites in NGB and
as a result, jarosite is an important phase formed in these envi-
ronments. Jarosite contains Fe(III), and requires that Fe(II) be
oxidized (Kappler and Straub, 2005). The abiotic rate of Fe oxi-
dation is quite slow at low pH (Singer and Stumm, 1970), so
biological mechanisms are likely responsible for the majority of

iron oxides and jarosite deposited in these systems. Furthermore,
the log saturation indices for jarosite were calculated for RS2A,
RS2C, and RS3A at −2.9,−1.2, and 0.3, respectively. Negative val-
ues indicate under-saturation of aqueous chemical species with
respect to K-jarosite, indicating that these solutions would not
be expected to precipitate jarosite, except perhaps in spring RS3.
In contrast, saturation indices were greater than 10 for NGB-BE
and NGB-OSP(owing primarily to the higher pH), which do not
contain jarosite as a solid phase.

Solid phases of ferric iron observed using synchrotron XRD
(major phases identiﬁed in Table 1) were used to constrain least
squares ﬁtting procedures of Fe-K-edge EXAFS spectra for all
ﬁeld samples. Least squares ﬁts to experimental k3 weighted

Fe-EXAFS spectra are shown for each of the major spring types
studied here (Figure 5) and these ﬁts provide further support for
the predominant solid phases observed using XRD. Speciﬁcally,
the ferric iron mats included in this study can be grouped into
these main four categories based on mineralogy: high arsenate-
amorphous Fe oxyhydroxides (sites BE, WG, OSP), ferrihydrite
and/or scorodite (e.g., GAP, EG, PB), goethite and hematite
(e.g., JC2), and jarositic systems containing less Fe oxide (e.g.,
RS2). The different phases of ferric Fe formed in these sys-
tems relate to differences in spring geochemistry and hydrody-
namic properties. For example, arsenic concentrations are one
to two orders of magnitude higher in NGB springs relative
to RS2 and JC2, respectively, and may play an important role

MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE
Molecular surveys of near full-length 16S rRNA genes present
in acidic Fe mats reveal numerous different novel archaea, espe-
cially within the Crenarchaeota (i.e., orders Sulfolobales, Desul-
furococcales, and Thermoproteales) as well as two deeply rooted
novel lineages with no cultured relatives (referred to as “Novel
Archaeal Groups” I and II; NAG1 and NAG2). All acidic Fe-oxide
mats contained signiﬁcant numbers of different Sulfolobales-like
sequences, which clade with three of the known Sulfolobales gen-
era; however, numerous entries cluster together within a previously
undescribed lineage. Sequences related to the novel Sulfolobales
clade are particularly well represented in NGB-WG and Joseph’s
Coat (Spring 2; Figure 6). An Fe(II)-oxidizing isolate was obtained
representing this novel lineage (strain MK5), and is discussed in
more detail below. The other Sulfolobales-like 16S rRNA gene
sequences present across the acidic Fe mats include members of
the Metallosphaera and Sulfolobus genera (Figure 6), and isolation
of M. yellowstonensis from these sites was described in previous
reports (Kozubal et al., 2008, 2011).

Sequences related to members of the candidate phylum Thau-
marchaeota and Euryarchaeota were also observed in acidic Fe
mats (Figure 6). Many of the thaumarchaeal sequences belong to
a separate lineage compared to previously cultivated mesophilic
isolates and the metagenome sequence from NGB-BE contains
one scaffold over 1 Mb in length, which is discussed in detail
elsewhere (Beam et al., 2011). The novel euryarchaeal sequences
were observed in BE, OSP, and JC2, and are distantly related to
Thermoplasma volcanium (∼89–90% similarity to 16S rRNA gene
sequences in GenBank).

A signiﬁcant majority (>99%) of bacterial 16S rRNA gene
sequences obtained from acidic Fe mats above ∼70˚C were related
to Hydrogenobaculum spp., a deeply rooted member of the order
Aquiﬁcales (Figure 7). However, bacterial diversity increased when
temperatures decreased below 60–65˚C. For example, bacteria dis-
tantly related to Acidimicrobium, Acidovorax, Acidicaldus, Methy-
lacidiphilum, Meiothermus, Geothermobacterium, and Sulfobacillus
spp. were found in greater abundance in down-gradient posi-
tions, depending on the speciﬁc spring. Acidovorax, Acidicaldus,
and Methylacidiphilum spp. were more common in acid-sulfate
springs (e.g., RS2EF), while Meiothermus and Acidimicrobium-like
populations were observed with greater frequency in the acid-
sulfate-chloride springs of NGB. Sequences related to Acidicaldus,
Geobacter, and Methylacidiphilum spp. were especially impor-
tant in Rainbow and Joseph’s Coat channel positions below 55˚C
(e.g., 60–70% of PCR ampliﬁed long-fragment bacterial clones
observed at RS3A, RS3B, and JC2C). Many of these bacterial
sequences are highly divergent from cultivated relatives (<91%
similarity, 16S rRNA gene), and include a novel clade related to
Geobacter spp. (represented by sequences RS2F-SK964 and RS2F–
SK975; Figure 7). The Geobacter-like sequences are only ∼83%
(16S rRNA sequence similarity) related to the nearest cultivated
delta-proteobacterium, Geobacter uraniireducens. Other notewor-
thy novel bacterial groups observed in these sites include sequences
related to Acidimicrobium ferrooxidans (clone RS2F-SK971, 90%),
Sulfobacillus acidophilus (RS2F-SK266, 89%), and ﬁnally, a distant
relative of Heliobacteriaceae bacterium SLH (clone RS3B-SK292,
83%), representing a highly divergent sequence in the Firmicutes.

FIGURE 3 | Proﬁle of Fe(II) oxidation in acidic geothermal springs at
Joseph’s Coat Hot Springs (JC2), Rainbow Springs (RS2) and Norris
Geyser Basin (Beowulf Spring) plotted as the disappearance of Fe(II)
or the production of Fe(III) as a function of time (or distance) within
the outﬂow channel. The total soluble Fe at any position is the sum of
Fe(II) and Fe(III), which agreed favorably (<10% difference) with total Fe
determined using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry [ICP; total Fe
values of JC2A, RS2A, and BEA are ∼100, 90, and 40 μM, respectively]. In
JC2, ∼45% of the total ferrous Fe is oxidized to Fe(III) at sampling position
D, corresponding to a 35-s travel time [sampling positions JC2E and RSC
correspond to a second spring discharge, which resets the concentration of
Fe(II)].

in the inhibition of jarosite precipitation and the subsequent
formation of amorphous ferrihydrite phases containing signif-
icant amounts of sorbed arsenate (Inskeep et al., 2004). Also,
the rate of amorphous ferrihydrite precipitation is faster than
crystalline phases such as goethite, hematite and jarosite, and
is consistent with the increase in dissolved Fe(III) from micro-
bial ferrous iron oxidation in JC2 and RS2 relative to NGB-BE
(Figure 3).

DEEPER 16S rRNA GENE SURVEYS WITHIN OSP SPRING
Additional full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences (PCR clone
libraries) were obtained at two locations within the outﬂow chan-
nel (pH 3.5) of OSP Spring (NGB) as part of a JGI ribosomal panel

study of YNP geothermal systems (CSP 787081). The distribution
of long-fragment 16S rRNA gene sequences observed in this data-
set (n ∼ 1200) shows extensive archaeal diversity in moderately
oxygenated Fe mats NGB-OSP8 (72˚C Fe mat) as well as 74˚C

ﬁlamentous-streamer communities dominated by Hydrogenobac-
ulum sp. (NGB-OSP14). Gene sequences observed in OSP8 reveal
extensive diversity from all orders of the Crenarchaeota (e.g., 13%
M. yellowstonensis str. MK1) as well as novel groups (62%). In
contrast, the ﬁlamentous“streamer”community (OSP14) archaeal
clone library was dominated by M. yellowstonensis (67%), and less
than 2% were related to novel archaeal groups (Thaumarchaeota as
well as novel members of the Euryarchaeota). All bacterial clones
(n = 600) ampliﬁed from these two sites in OSP Spring belong to
the genus Hydrogenobaculum.
Deeper 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis using pyrotag
sequencing (average nucleotide length= 180 bp) was also per-
formed in several Fe-oxide microbial mats in NGB, includ-
ing OSP Spring (OSPB, OSPC, OSPD), Beowulf Spring (BEE),
and Grendel Spring (GRN_L). In addition, 16S rRNA sequences
were obtained from assemblies of random shotgun metagenome
sequence obtained from OSPB, OSPC, BED, and BEE. Given
that several locations within OSP received random metagenome
and pyrotag sequencing, comparison of phylogenetic signatures
observed using the different methods was possible (Table 2),
including reference to long-fragment 16S rRNA gene sequences
from the above mentioned ribosomal panel obtained for OSP8
(which was sampled at same temperature as OSPB). Excellent
agreement among three methods of assessing archaeal diversity
was obtained for OSPB (Table 2) indicating that the higher tem-
perature locations (i.e., 72–76˚C) in this spring are dominated by
novel archaeal group I (NAG1, 50–60%), followed by M. yellowsto-
nensis ∼12–20%), Vulcanisaeta spp. (∼10–15%), Acidilobus spp.
(6–8%), a novel archaeal group II lineage (NAG2, ∼1–3%), and
lower amounts of other novel archaeal groups (including Thau-
marchaeota and Sulfolobales). Clustering of shorter pyrotag 16S
sequences using long-fragment archaeal clone groups (e.g., those

shown in Figure 6) from the same spring types (as opposed to
only cultivated organisms with reference genomes) proved to be
an excellent method of binning pyrotag sequences and estimates of
percent abundance of the major taxonomic lineages in OSPB using
pyrotag analysis are very close to estimates obtained from either
long-fragment PCR analysis or binning of random metagenome
sequence reads into the same phylogenetic groups (Table 2).

Comparison of pyrotag 16S rRNA gene sequence estimates with
binning of random shotgun sequence reads from two additional
sites (OSPC and D, 65 and 60˚C) also reveal excellent agreement
between the two methods of obtaining semi-quantitative estimates
of the distribution of archaea in Fe-oxide mats. Results from lower
temperatures provide evidence for separation of NAG1 and NAG2
groups by temperature, where NAG2-like sequences increase in
abundance as temperature decreases; at OSPD, NAG2-like seq-
uences represent the dominant population (∼32%; Table 2). Other
community members including M. yellowstonensis and NAG1
remain important at lower temperatures, and Sulfolobales strain
MK5-like populations were slightly more abundant in OSPD.

Two additional Fe-oxide mat samples evaluated using pyro-
tag sequencing included locations within Beowulf and Grendel
Springs (Figure 8). Although similar to end-member amorphous
Fe-oxide mats of NGB including the OSP series discussed above,
BEE and GRND_L reveal slightly different community types com-
pared to OSP. Consistent populations observed compared to OSP
include M. yellowstonensis, NAG1, NAG2, and novel Sulfolobales,
however, GRND_L contained a signiﬁcantly higher percentage of
thaumarchaeal and novel Thermoplasmatales-like populations.

Spring, M. yellowstonensis str. MK1, has been described (Kozubal

MK3, and MK6 reveal similarity to previously described isolates
ranging from 96 to 98%, and likely represent new species in

the Sulfobacillus, Sulfolobus, and Acidicaldus genera, respectively
(Table 3). However, Sulfolobales str. MK5 is only 88% similar to
Sulfolobus islandicus (16S rRNA gene), and forms a completely new
lineage within the current order Sulfolobales (Figure 6). Genome
sequencing of strain MK5 is nearly complete and is currently
represented as ∼2 Mb of assembled sequence on four scaffolds.

Sulfolobales isolates (strains MK3 and MK5) had higher tempera-
ture optimum (65–75˚C) than the two bacterial isolates (55–65˚C).
All isolates grow optimally between pH 2.0 and 3.0; however,
strains MK3 and MK5 exhibited slightly lower pH optima ranging
from 2.0 to 2.5 (Table 2). Strain MK5 has the lowest pH range for
growth and active cells were observed as low as 1.2. The Sulfolob-

IRON OXIDATION AND REDUCTION RATES AND ANALYSIS OF CULTURE
Fe SOLID PHASES
Iron oxidation rates were determined for Sulfolobales str. MK5
cultivated at 65˚C with 10 mM Fe(II) sorbed to sterile Fe-oxide
mat (obtained from NGB-BE). Iron oxidation rates ranged from
15.7± 1.2 to 14.5± 2.9 fmol Fe(II) L
−1 at pH 1.5 and
2.5, respectively, for cultures grown autotrophically (without mix-
ing/exposure to air only). Similar results were shown for M. yellow-
stonensis str. MK1 ranging from 7.4± 1.5 to 12.4± 3.1 fmol Fe(II)

−1 at pH 3.2 and 2.5, respectively, reﬂecting slightly
L
different pH optima between strains MK5 (this study) and M. yel-
lowstonensis (Kozubal et al., 2008). The secondary phases formed
during microbial Fe(II)-oxidation were determined for strain MK5
and M. yellowstonensis (not previously reported) grown on pyrite
or Fe(II)-ferrihydrite (pyrite cultures shown in Figure 9) using
both XRD and EXAFS. After 11 days of incubation under these
growth conditions, hematite is the primary crystalline phase form-
ing at the water-air interface (XRD analysis), whereas jarosite is
found below the water surface. Least squares ﬁtting of Fe-K-edge
EXAFS spectra obtained on solid phases formed during microbial
oxidation suggest mixed solid phases supported by XRD analy-
ses (∼41% ferrihydrite, 24% jarosite, 16% goethite, and 12%
hematite). XRD analysis of strain MK5 cultures revealed both
goethite and jarosite in slurry samples from the bottom of the
growth vessel (Figure 9). Consequently, Fe-oxidation products
varied both with the isolate, location in the growth vessel, as
well as across different spring compositions (Table 1; Figure 4).
Under ﬁeld conditions, jarosite was only observed at Rainbow and
Joseph’s Coat Springs (minor), where higher concentrations of
“in channel” Fe(III), SO2−
all favor the formation of K-
jarosite, despite lower saturation indices with respect to jarosite
relative to the higher pH (3.1–3.5) systems of NGB (Table 1).

blue, and metagenome sequence entries are listed in dark red).

All isolates were tested for growth using YE, Fe(II), S0, pyrite,
and solid media (Table 3). In addition, isolates were tested for their
ability to ﬁx carbon dioxide in carbon free media. Sulfolobus str.
MK3 is capable of autotrophic growth and all isolates are capable
of oxidizing Fe(II) except the Acidicaldus str. MK6. The Sulfolob-
ales isolates (strains MK3 and MK5) are also capable of oxidizing
pyrite (FeS2). Moreover, strains MK5 and MK6 were shown to
both reduce Fe(III) including amorphous Fe oxyhydroxides found
in YNP Fe mats and a variety of ferric oxide minerals includ-
ing hematite, ferrihydrite, and goethite. In fact, strain MK5 was
shown to re-reduce Fe oxides (formed during aerobic growth)
when grown under anoxic conditions using Gelrite® as a C and
energy source. All strains were capable of utilizing complex car-
bon from yeast extract for heterotrophic growth, consequently,
none are obligate autotrophs.

cluster in S. tokodaii (Bathe and Norris, 2007). Like S. tokodaii and
S. metallicus, strain MK5 has only one copy of foxA (the subunit I of
the HCO) as compared to two copies in M. sedula, and three copies
in M. yellowstonensis (Auernik et al., 2008; Kozubal et al., 2011).
Strain MK5 also has a cbsAB–soxL2N gene operon, which has
been identiﬁed as important in iron-oxidizing Sulfolobales (Kap-
pler et al., 2005). Strain MK5 contains a gene encoding a sulﬁde
quinone oxidoreductase (sqr) and a conserved hdr gene cluster
important in elemental sulfur oxidation (Quatrini et al., 2009).
Additionally, the strain has genes for a tqoAD thiosulfate oxidase
directly upstream to the cbsAB–soxL2N gene operon. Strain MK5
does not contain genes for any of the known CO2 ﬁxation path-
ways (Berg et al., 2010). However the organism contains a number
of genes encoding complex carbon degrading proteins including
numerous cellulases, xylanases, and xenobiotic dioxygenases.

Metagenome analysis of NGB-BE and NGB-OSP yielded mul-
tiple copies of fox genes highly similar to those found in strain
MK5 and M. yellowstonensis, suggesting these two organisms along
with other Sulfolobales strains (e.g., Sulfolobus str. MK3) are the

dominant populations responsible for Fe(II) oxidation via this
mechanism. Genes related to cytochromes linked to Fe(II) oxida-
tion in the well-characterized bacteria Acidithiobacillus ferrooxi-
dans and Leptospirillum spp. were not found in the OSP and BE
metagenomes (Jeans et al., 2008; Singer et al., 2008; Quatrini et al.,
2009). Small blue copper proteins have also been associated with
Fe(II) oxidation in A. ferrooxidans and the Euryarchaeota “Ferro-
plasma acidarmanus” (Dopson et al., 2005) and similar sequences
were identiﬁed in the YNP metagenomes. However, most of these
sequences are homologs of sulfocyanin (soxE) from M. yellow-
stonensis – and strain MK5-like species, which are more likely
involved in the SoxM-like terminal oxidase complex speciﬁc for
heterotrophy, and not involved in Fe(II) oxidation (Kozubal et al.,
2011).

DISCUSSION
Ferric iron mats of NGB, Joseph’s Coat, and Rainbow Springs
in YNP exhibit considerable microbial diversity as shown by the
extensive compilation of phylogenetic data including 1500 full-
length 16S rRNA gene sequences, over ∼40,000 pyrotag sequences
and ﬁve shotgun metagenome sequences from BED, BEE, OSPB,
OSPC, and OSPD. The Sulfolobales are important in all 18 spring

sites as indicated by the high percentage of 16S rRNA sequences
and binning of metagenome sequence reads. M. yellowstonensis str.
MK1-like 16S rRNA gene sequences are highly dominant in most
sampling points particularly in Joseph’s Coat and Rainbow Springs
between 60 and 75˚C. In addition, metagenome data strongly
suggest that M. yellowstonensis-like populations are important in
NGB-BE and NGB-OSP Springs as evidenced by the number of
total reads binning to the M. yellowstonensis genome (Inskeep et al.,
2010). Detailed community analysis of M. yellowstonensis related
species along with expression of fox genes in situ are discussed in
more detail elsewhere (Kozubal et al., 2011). Novel Sulfolobales-
like MK5-like populations also contribute a high percentage of
metagenome reads and 16S rRNA gene sequences, but at slightly
lower temperatures (e.g., OSPC and OSPD).

Sequences from members of the Desulfurococcales, Thermo-
proteales, and novel archaeal lineages are also important in YNP
ferric iron mats. In addition, sites below 65˚C are characterized
by highly divergent 16S rRNA bacterial gene sequences especially
at sites RS2F and RS3B. Many of these bacterial sequences are
less than 90% similar to cultivated relatives and represent three
new taxonomic branches at the order level and higher (Figure 7).
Above 70˚C, bacterial gene sequences are completely dominated by
Hydrogenobaculum spp. and detailed sequence analysis of NG-OSP
and RS2 reveal two distinct sub-clades.

The microbial community structure of acidic iron mats is
likely driven by the ﬂux of O2 required to drive Fe(II) oxida-
tion, as well as the presence of other reduced inorganic electron
donors available for growth. However, temperature and pH are
also important parameters controlling community structure. For
instance, sequences related to Acidilobus spp., Stygiolobus azoricus,
and Thermoproteales spp. (i.e., Vulcanisaeta distributa) dominate
at higher temperatures, consistent with the range observed for
cultivated relatives. Moreover, bacteria such as Sulfobacillus and
Acidicaldus spp. thrive at lower temperatures. M. yellowstonensis
was found to be prevalent in all sites, and the relative importance
of novel populations such as NAG1, NAG2, Thaumarchaeota and
Euryarchaeota varies across sites. However, the primary popula-
tions involved directly in Fe cycling appear to be aerobic organisms
that use the Fox terminal oxidase complex consistent with genome,
metagenome, and prior mRNA expression analysis.

The ﬁve isolates discussed in this study are highly relevant to
our understanding of geomicrobiology and microbial ecology of
acidic geothermal ferric iron mats of YNP. All isolates are capable
of oxidizing iron and strains MK5 and MK6 are also capable of
ferric iron reduction under anaerobic conditions. M. yellowsto-
nensis and Sulfolobus str. MK3 are capable of autotrophic growth
and are likely important primary producers in situ linking CO2
ﬁxation directly with Fe(II) oxidation. These organisms may be
a signiﬁcant source of carbon for other microorganisms such as
Acidicaldus str. MK6, which may need this carbon source for anaer-
obic growth on Fe(III). Therefore, the Sulfolobales isolates offer an
excellent opportunity to understand mechanisms of CO2 ﬁxation
in model natural systems. Uncharacterized archaeal and bacter-
ial populations in ferric oxide mats may also be linked to other
electron donors besides Fe(II) (Table 1). For instance, Methy-
lacidiphilum-like sequences are found in JC2F and RS3A at 70 and
29% of bacterial sequences, respectively, and may take advantage of

the relatively high CH4 concentrations (2.2 and 3.5 μM) compared
to other spring locations. These organisms remain a high priority
for isolation.

Analysis of ferric solid phases on serum bottle cultures link
observed biomineralized phases found in the springs to cultured
organisms. Spring geochemistry [i.e., sulfate and Fe(III) concen-
trations, pH, presence of arsenate] plays an important role in the
formation of mineral phases. However, populations highly similar
to strains MK1 and MK5 contribute directly to the observed oxi-
dation of Fe(II) in YNP ferric iron mats and especially MK1-like
populations in RS2 and JC2 above 65˚C (Kozubal et al., 2008). In
culture, M. yellowstonensis forms hematite and jarosite on serum
bottle surfaces and XRD analysis of strain MK5 identiﬁed jarosite
and goethite as a slurry on the vessel bottom (Figure 9). The
different ferric iron phases found in cultures stress that different
microbial processes (both “biologically controlled” and “biolog-
ically induced”) are important in determining the iron phases
formed. Moreover, different solution conditions contribute to
variation in solid phases observed across ﬁeld sites.

Strains MK1 and MK5 oxidize Fe(II) at rates similar to those
observed in other archaeal species under similar culture condi-
tions (Nemati and Harrison, 2000; Kauppi et al., 2001). Both
strains exhibit faster rates of Fe(II)-oxidation at lower pH, which is
consistent with observations of other acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing
microorganisms. The ﬁxation of CO2 under culture conditions
was observed only for strain MK1. In fact, genes for any of the
six known CO2 ﬁxation pathways were not found in strain MK5
(Berg et al., 2010), which is unique compared to other Sulfolob-
ales (all reference Sulfolobales genomes contain genes for the 3-
hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway). However, strain
MK5 has genes that encode for a wide range of proteins known to
be involved in the degradation of complex carbon sources. Con-
sequently, these results suggest strain MK1 is a dominant primary
producer that links CO2 ﬁxation to Fe(II) oxidation, whereas strain
MK5 is a mixotroph linking Fe(II) oxidation to utilization of com-
plex carbon. Strain MK5 is also capable of Fe(III) reduction by an
unknown mechanism and may, alternatively, deﬁne its niche in situ
as an anaerobic complex carbon degrader linked to Fe(III) respi-
ration. Elucidating the mechanism of Fe(III) reduction in strain
MK5 will be an important future priority for understanding iron
cycling in these systems.

The oxidation of Fe(II) in high-temperature environments
may have also been important in Earth’s early evolutionary his-
tory (>2–3 Ga). The biomineralization of ferric iron phases (e.g.,
jarosite) and the evolution of key metabolic processes such as aer-
obic respiration in high-temperature Fe mats has implications for
the ﬁelds of paleobiology and exobiology, as well as microbiology.
The ﬁndings presented in this study represent the most detailed
analysis of geothermal acidic ferric iron mats reported to date,
and will be invaluable for future comparative studies to similar
undescribed environments.
