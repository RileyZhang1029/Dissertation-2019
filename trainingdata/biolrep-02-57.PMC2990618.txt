Abstract
The function of glutamate receptors on oligodendrocytes and their precursor cells is poorly
understood, with their only clear action being to damage these cells in pathological conditions. Here
we review recent studies of glutamate signalling to oligodendrocyte lineage cells, and explore what its
physiological function may be.

Introduction and context
Given the intimate association of neurons and glia in the
central nervous system, it is not surprising that the main
excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, is also recognized
by a diverse group of resident glial cells. Oligodendrocyte
lineage cells have long been known to respond to
glutamate [1-3], but
the only established effect of
glutamate ‘signalling’ is the damage that these cells suffer
in pathological conditions (for a review and relevant
publications see [4]). For example,
the extracellular
glutamate level rises when glutamate transporters reverse
in conditions such as stroke, or secondary ischaemia
caused by blood vessel damage following spinal cord
injury, or in development when inadequate blood flow
reaches the white matter around the cerebral ventricles
leading to cerebral palsy. Changes in the expression levels
of
the enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine
synthetase, and glutaminase also lead to a rise in
extracellular glutamate concentration in multiple sclerosis
lesions. An elevated glutamate level activates receptors
that damage oligodendrocytes or, in the case of cerebral
palsy, the precursor cells that will become oligodendro-
cytes. Are there, however, any positive aspects of
glutamate signalling to oligodendrocyte lineage cells?

Major recent advances
A significant step forward came with the discovery
that neurons send synaptic input to oligodendrocyte

precursor cells (OPCs) in the grey matter [5], and also in
the white matter [6-8]. These contacts have the ultra-
structural and pharmacological
features of bona fide
excitatory synapses involving glial a-amino-3-hydroxy-
5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate
(KA) receptors (or GABAA receptors: the intracellular
[Cl−] is high in OPCs, so GABA is excitatory [9]). In the
white matter this input was shown to occur from
unmyelinated axons [7,8], prompting the notion that
this could be a developmental signal from active axons,
instructing nearby OPCs to stop proliferating and to start
to myelinate the axons (Figure 1). Conceivably, such
signalling could, with other known trophic factors, help
to match the number of oligodendrocytes formed to the
length of axon that needs to be myelinated. However,
although previous work in culture showed that gluta-
mate does inhibit the proliferation (and lineage progres-
sion) of OPCs [10], the demonstration that the synapses
onto precursors are maintained through cell division
[11,12] argues strongly against an immediate inhibitory
effect of synaptic input on proliferation rate. Activation
of AMPA receptors on OPCs might also promote OPC
migration to sites of myelination [13], although it is not
known whether glutamate released from neuronal
synapses onto the OPCs can have this effect, and
migration would seem to be incompatible with main-
taining the presence of synapses from particular axons.
AMPA/KA receptors on OPCs might also trigger

Axonal and oligodendrocyte glutamate transporters cause a non-vesicular glutamate release in conditions of energy deprivation such as stroke and secondary
ischaemia following spinal cord injury. Whether glutamatergic stimulation of OPCs regulates their differentiation and myelination awaits in vivo evidence.

drocytes, the synaptic input from axons is lost [15,16]
(Figure 1).

a rise of [Ca2+]i [20], but whether this alters the migratory
behaviour of OPCs, regulates differentiation, or leads
OPCs to release some factor onto other cells currently
remains obscure.

Amplification of the effect of excitatory synaptic input
onto OPCs was recently suggested to occur because a
subpopulation of OPCs (identified by their expression of
the oligodendrocyte specific transcription factor Olig2
and the proteoglycan NG2) express voltage-gated Na+
channels that, at least in some rat OPCs, are present at a
density sufficient to evoke action potentials [17]. In
contrast, another subclass of OPCs neither received
synaptic input nor fired action potentials [17]. Studies
on mouse OPCs (identified by expression of dsRed
driven by the NG2 promoter) reported no action
potentials in Na+-channel-expressing OPCs [15], and it
was suggested that the action-potential-generating cells
were migrating interneurons rather than OPCs. However,
this is hard to reconcile with their expression of Olig2
and NG2 and their lack of expression of NeuN [17].
Indeed, recent work on mouse OPCs (labelled with green
fluorescent protein expressed under control of the Pdgfra
or Sox10 promoters) revealed that the size of the voltage-
gated Na+ current in these cells was fivefold smaller than
in rat OPCs [18], resulting in spike-like regenerative
activity being much weaker [12,18,19]. Excitatory
synaptic input will tend to activate the voltage-gated
Na+ current, and thus depolarize the cell further, while
simultaneously raising [Na+]i. These effects will promote

It is of increasing interest to define the receptor subtypes
mediating glutamatergic signalling to oligodendrocyte
lineage cells, and their subcellular location.
It was
originally believed that ischaemic damage to oligoden-
drocytes and their precursors resulted solely from the
activation of AMPA/KA receptors, but increasing evidence
implicates NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate) receptors as
well. Applying glutamate or NMDA activates NMDA
receptor- as well as AMPA/KA receptor-mediated currents
in the cells [6,15,17,21]. In ischaemia, activation of
NMDA receptors is partly responsible for damage to
developing OPCs [21] and to the myelinating processes of
oligodendrocytes [22,23], and (along with KA receptor
activation) contributes to retraction of the paranodal folds
from the node of Ranvier [24], raising the question of
whether glutamate receptors are preferentially localized at
the paranodal folds of the myelin. However, the extent to
which blocking NMDA receptors preserves the function of
myelinated axons after ischaemia requires further inves-
tigation [25,26]. The NMDA receptors involved show less
Mg2+-block than neuronal NMDA receptors [6], suggest-
ing that they have an unusual subunit composition
[6,22,23]. Surprisingly, given these results, transcriptome
analysis [27] indicates that although NMDA receptors are
expressed in OPCs, their expression at the mRNA level

drops to low levels as the cells mature into myelinating
oligodendrocytes, yet immunocytochemistry suggests that
NMDA receptors are present both on the myelinating
processes of oligodendrocytes [6,22,23] and on develop-
ing oligodendrocyte precursors [21]. A similar down-
regulation of AMPA receptors with development has also
been reported [15,16].

NMDA receptors do not seem to contribute to synaptic
currents evoked in OPCs by neuronal activity
[7,8,15,16], raising the question of what their physio-
logical function may be. One suggestion, based on
experiments in which dorsal root ganglion cells are
myelinated by OPCs in culture, is that the growth factor
neuregulin produces a switch in the mode of myelina-
tion by OPCs: without neuregulin added to the culture
medium myelination is independent of neuronal activity
and glutamate release, while with neuregulin added
myelination depends both on action potentials and on
activation of NMDA receptors [28]. Myelination is
generally thought to depend on action potentials [29],
but myelination of fixed axons (which clearly have no
action potentials) has also been reported [30] and this
may correspond to the activity-independent mode of
myelination seen in these studies.

In addition to ionotropic glutamate receptors, develop-
ing oligodendrocytes in culture and in vivo express
metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), particu-
larly mGluR5, which is downregulated as the cells
mature [27,31-33]. The function of these receptors is
unclear but, in cultured OPCs, activation of group 1
mGluRs (presumably mGluR5) raises [Ca2+]i [31], leads
to the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor [34]
(which could promote myelin formation), and reduces
both excitotoxic damage to the cells and apoptosis
induced by staurosporine [32,33,35].

Future directions
Considerable work will be required to establish the true
function of glutamatergic signalling to oligodendrocyte
lineage cells. Genetic engineering in mice will provide
into the roles of particular glutamate
some insight
for a phenomenon as
receptor subtypes. However,
important as myelination,
is likely that several
mechanisms will operate in parallel, and with functional
redundancy in place mutant phenotypes may not be
informative. There are several crucial aspects of neuron-
to-glia signalling that we need to establish. Is it only the
glutamate that is released at synapses onto OPCs that is
functionally relevant, or can tonic activation of high-
affinity NMDA receptors also modulate cell function?
What is the role of glutamate transporters, which are

it

reported either to generate a large current in mature
oligodendrocytes [15,16] or to greatly reduce the gluta-
mate-evoked current [6]? What are the pathways down-
stream of glutamate receptors that control OPC
development and myelination, and does this signalling
contribute to determining whether OPCs develop into
oligodendrocytes, or into astrocytes or neurons [36-38]?
Do these pathways also function to maintain myelination
in the adult animal? Are there functions of glutamatergic
signalling other than regulation of oligodendrocyte
development? Does glutamate signalling play a role in
the formation of
the glial scar in pathology, or in
remyelination, since adult OPCs receive glutamatergic
synaptic input as they migrate during remyelination [39]?
