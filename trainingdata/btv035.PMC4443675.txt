Associate Editor: John Hancock  Received on September 8, 2014  revised on December 4, 2014  accepted on January 15, 2015  Abstract  Summary: Protein-coding genes with multiple alternative polyadenylation sites can generate mRNA 30UTR sequences of different lengths, thereby causing the loss or gain of regulatory elem- ents, which can affect stability, localization and translation efﬁciency.
3USS is a web-server de- veloped with the aim of giving experimentalists the possibility to automatically identify alternative 30UTRs (shorter or longer with respect to a reference transcriptome), an option that is not available in standard RNA-seq data analysis procedures.
The tool reports as putative novel the 30UTRs not annotated in available databases.
Furthermore, if data from two related samples are uploaded, common and speciﬁc alternative 30UTRs are identiﬁed and reported by the server.
Availability and implementation: 3USS is freely available at http://www.biocomputing.it/3uss_ server Contact: anna.tramontano@uniroma1.it Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

1 Introduction The 30 untranslated regions (30UTRs) of mRNAs play a crucial role in post-transcriptional they contain cis-regulatory elements, such as AU-rich elements (ARE), microRNA binding sites, etc.
(Khabar, 2005  Bartel, 2009), which can affect transcript stability, degradation, subcellular localization and transla- tion.
Through alternative polyadenylation, a widespread mechanism in eukaryotic organisms, different isoforms of the same gene can acquire alternative (longer or shorter) 30 untranslated regions (Elkon et al., 2013).
The phenomenon seems to be different in different tissues (Lianoglou et al., 2013), during development (Ji et al., 2009) and, recently, it has also been observed in cancer cells (Mayr and Bartel 2009).
With the emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies, it is now possible to sequence entire transcriptomes in one experiment.
In standard RNA-seq data analysis protocols the reconstructed transcripts are compared with an annotated Reference transcriptome.
The most commonly used methods  [e.g.
Cuffcompare and Cuffmerge (Trapnell et al., 2012)] distinguish known from putative novel isoforms, but they rely on the compari- son of the intronic structure of the transcripts, thereby do not take into account reads that might support the existence of alternative 30UTRs and therefore the existence of putative novel transcripts with different 30UTR is not reported to the user.
The great interest for these important regulatory regions is leading to the development of more sophisticated RNA sequencing library preparation protocols (the more powerful will be the possibility to entirely sequence the untranslated region, the more accurate will the reconstruction of pu- tative novel 3 UTRs be).
At the same time, different computational tools to capture [Lu et al., 2013  Wang et al., 2014  github.com/vod- katad/roar (compbio.dundee.ac.uk/ polyADB/, mosas.sysu.edu.cn/utr) the 30 ends of polyadenylated transcripts have been recently developed.
Nevertheless, the identifi- cation of 30UTR alternative regions still remains a challenge.

to automatically identify the assembled transcripts with alternative 30UTRs with respect to the ones in Reference transcriptomes and provides the user with their nucleotide sequence together with their genomic coordinates and other information, such as their difference in length and the corresponding gene.
Furthermore, when data from two related experiments are provided, the reconstructed 30UTRs of each biological sample are identified and compared.
2 Description  The server starts the analysis from a transcriptome assembly file ob- tained by standard computational methods for RNA-seq transcript reconstruction, such as Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2012), Scripture (Guttman et al., 2010) and others.
Indeed, the 3USS procedure is in- dependent from the transcriptome reconstruction method used to obtain the RNA-seq assembly file as long as the data have been com- pared with a Reference annotation [such as UCSC (Rhead et al.
2010), NCBI (Pruitt et al., 2014), Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2010), Gencode (Harrow et al., 2012), etc.]
using Cuffcompare or Cuffmerge (see the Help page for full information).
3USS also per- mits to easily retrieve the genomic coordinates and sequences of transcripts already annotated in public databases.
2.1 Input For identifying RNA-seq assembled transcripts with alternative 30UTRs with respect to a Reference, the user needs to provide: the organism and related genome version  the Reference annotation transcriptome and one or two RNA-seq transcriptome assembly files (as above described).
An example using public data from GEO data- base (Barrett et al.
2013) is accessible from the 3USS input page.
(http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/igenomes.html)  2.2 Results Each assembled transcript is processed by selecting the isoforms sharing the same intron chain of known protein-coding transcripts in the Reference.
The reconstructed 30UTRs are consequently identi- fied as the regions located immediately after the stop-codon and can be directly compared, detecting possible differences in their 30UTR lengths.
The alternative 30UTRs are then compared with already annotated ones in other databases [the latest available data from iGenomes and Gencode (Harrow et al., 2012)] to identify putative novel (not yet annotated) 30UTRs.
The most informative output files that the 3USS server produces are: a fasta file with the alternative 30UTR nucleo- tide sequences and other information in their headers (gene Id, cod- ing strand, 30UTR genomic coordinates and length)  a list of the transcripts with their 30UTR length difference and a list of the alter- native not yet annotated 30UTRs (putative novel) in other databases as well as the annotated ones.
The user can also easily visualize the transcripts in a graphical environment through the UCSC Genome browser (Kent et al., 2002  see examples in the Supplementary Material).
If an already annotated transcriptome is uploaded as in- put, the 30UTR sequences and genomic coordinates of all the pro- tein-coding transcripts are returned.
If the user submits input files derived from two different related RNA-seq experiments, the 3USS server compares the alternative 30UTRs, reporting how they are dis- tributed across the two biological samples (Fig.
1).
Each transcript with an alternative 30UTR is associated to its assembled transcript id (e.g.
TCONS_0000X, for Cufflinks tran- scriptome assembly files), and through it, to all the corresponding analysis information (read coverage,  so that useful  results,  Fig.

A Venn diagram illustrates how the tran- scripts with alternative 30UTRs are distributed across the two experiments.

can be directly retrieved from the com- plete RNA-seq data analysis results.
3 Conclusion  To the best of our knowledge, 3USS is the only available web-server that can automatically detect the presence of isoforms with alterna- tive 30UTRs in the RNA-seq experiment under investigation and output their genomic coordinates and nucleotide sequences for fur- ther analysis.
Moreover, we believe that a protocol independent tool, such as the one described here, is useful and not only to retrieve information on novel 30UTRs, but also to easily compare the results of different methods and approaches.
Through an easy to use inter- face, it also allows the comparison of the 30UTRs of the sequenced transcripts in different biological conditions.
This allows researchers to further examine genes affected by 30UTR shortening or lengthen- ing and, for example identify their biological relevance using public tools such as FIDEA (D Andrea et al., 2013) or others, as well as dir- ectly analyze the novel 30UTR nucleotide sequences to detect differ- ences in the presence or absence of regulatory motifs and/or binding sites.
