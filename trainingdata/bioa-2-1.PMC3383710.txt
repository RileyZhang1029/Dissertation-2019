Volume 1 has defined the scope of BioArchitecture. From the outset we have strived to ensure that BioArchitecture is not
limited to the three major polymer systems of the cytoplasm. I am happy to say that a cursory glance at the contents of
volume 1 makes it clear that we are interested in all aspects of bioarchitecture from molecules to polymers to cells to
tissue to the organism.

What is Bioarchitecture?

from chemistry and physics? Perhaps
Schrodinger would be disappointed by
the answer; although I doubt it. He did
argue in What
is Life (1944) that the
challenge was to understand how physics
and chemistry could be organized in
time and space within the boundaries
of
a biological organism. There was
enthusiasm for the possibility that biology
would provide a new scientific discipline
with principles not predictable
from
physics and chemistry. Instead, biology
has given us the elegance of physics and
chemistry organized in time and space
to create a remarkable range of bio-
logical organisms. There has been no
need to go beyond physics and chemi-
stry. Indeed, the triumph of biology is
the control of chemistry and physics
in space and the ability to regulate it
in time.

this organization is being greatly
advanced by the capacity to perform
single molecule biochemistry and physics
in living systems. However,
there are
many levels to bioarchitecture.

The structure of all

living systems is
remarkably crafted to suit their survival
and propagation. From T4 phage to the
leaves on trees and the human hand, the
architecture of these biological systems has
evolved structural properties to achieve the
required biological outcomes.

The organization of cells and their
extracellular matrix to create functioning
tissues with a sense of functional integrity
must ultimately be explicable in terms of
molecular
interactions with associated
physical properties and chemical signals
which integrate the whole.

Our understanding of intracellular space
has gone through a profound transforma-
tion in the past 30 years. What was once
biochemical
stew is now revealed as
exquisite spatial choreography which orga-
nizes the chemistry of the cell and its
ability to both generate and respond to
forces. The intrinsic dynamic

provides both extraordinary
flexibility
and at the same time structural integrity.
While this is most easily understood in
terms of polymer systems, it is as relevant
to membrane organization, compartmen-
talisation of
signaling systems and the
organization of metabolic pathways.

The nucleus is increasingly revealing
structural features which underpin nuclear
function. Although it is hardly surprising
specific domains are required to

organize splicing and transport, visualiza-
tion of these domains and their dynamics
has been challenging. This
is now
extending to the architecture of chromatin
to create structural domains which are
likely to be intrinsic to transcription and
replication. In retrospect, this should not
be too surprising given that we are dealing
with nature’s largest polymer. It would be
unlike evolution not to take advantage of
this opportunity.

Looking Forward to 2012

I want to thank our contributors to the
first volume who have set the scope for
the journal and pointed the way forward.
In the coming year we are looking to
expand our coverage of topics relevant to
the architecture of biological systems at all
levels. We encourage you to contact
myself, Associate Editors or members of
the Editorial Board with any ideas for
reviews and the toolbox (Everything you
need to know about…) in addition to
original article contributions.

Last and most, I wish to thank all the
the
Associate Editors and members of
Editorial Board for their commitment to
the journal.
