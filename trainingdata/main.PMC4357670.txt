In plants, miRNAs have increas- ingly been identiﬁed by experiments based on next-generation sequencing (NGS).
However, pro- moter organization is currently unknown for most plant miRNAs, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase II.
This deﬁciency prevents a comprehensive understanding of miRNA-mediated gene networks.
In this study, by analyzing full-length cDNA sequences related to miRNAs, we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) for 62 and 55 miRNAs in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively.
The average free energy (AFE) proﬁles in the vicinity of TSSs were studied for both species.
By employing position weight matrices (PWM) for 99 plant cis-elements, we discovered that three cis-elements were over-represented in the miRNA promoters of both species, while four and ten cis-elements were over-represented in Arabidopsis only and in rice only.
Thus, comparison of miR- NA promoters between Arabidopsis and rice provides a new perspective for studying miRNA reg- ulation in plants.
Introduction  Following the initial discovery in the worm Caenorhabditis ele- gans [1,2], microRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly recognized as an important class of regulatory small RNA molecules in both animals and plants [3,4].
Endogenous miRNAs are en- coded by MIR genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II [3,4].

In higher plants, both pri-miRNAs and pre-miRNAs are pro- cessed in the nucleus mainly by the endonuclease DICER- LIKE1 [6].
Mature miRNAs are then transported to the cyto- plasm and integrated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [7,8].
After integration into RISC, miRNAs interact with their cognate target transcripts through base pairing.
In plants, such interactions typically lead to repression of gene expression through cleavage [9,10] or translational inhibition of the target mRNA [11].
Down regulation of transcription by miRNA-directed DNA methylation at the target loci has also been reported in plants [12].
Given the critical role of miRNAs in gene regulation, tem- poral and spatial control of the expression of individual MIR genes needs to be elucidated before arriving at a complete understanding of the gene networks mediated by miRNAs.
In plants, several studies have been carried out to computa-  1672-0229/$ - see front matter ª 2013 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of China.

Results from these studies indicate that there are certain cis- regulatory elements enriched in the miRNA promoters [13].
In contrast to well-established programs for predicting the sec- ondary structure of miRNA precursors or the miRNA-target interactions, computational methods to identify the promoter regions only have limited success.
Pinpointing the transcription start site (TSS) by locating the 50 end of primary transcript represents another approach to map the miRNA promoter.
Using experimentally-obtained 50 transcript ends, Xie et al.
successfully mapped the TSSs for 52 MIR genes in Arabidopsis [15].
However, technical demands of this approach indicate that it is impractical for other plant species.
On the other hand, full-length cDNA clones are re- garded as critical resources for post-genomic research and have been extensively collected and sequenced in Arabidopsis, rice and tomato [16 19].
Utilization of these resources should gen- erate knowledge on miRNA primary transcripts and facilitate further understanding of cis-regulatory elements governing miRNA transcription.
The goal of the current study is to identify and compare the promoter regions of miRNA genes between Arabidopsis and rice.
Toward this goal, we mapped full-length cDNA se- quences available to annotated miRNAs and collected TSS information for 62 and 55 miRNAs in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively.
We then employed 99 position weight matrices (PWM) and discovered cis-elements that are statistically over-represented in Arabidopsis or rice miRNA promoters.
This work thus represents a step forward in understanding reg- ulation of miRNA genes in plants.
Results and discussion  Determination of TSSs for miRNAs by full-length cDNA mapping  The overall workﬂow of the current work is to employ full- length cDNA available in the model plants Arabidopsis and rice to precisely pinpoint the TSS for miRNA genes, and then use such information to analyze and compare the promoter features between the two species.
To this end, we ﬁrst mapped to the genome sequences the 299 and 591 annotated miRNA precursors in Arabidopsis and rice [20], respectively.
We then mapped  155,000 full length-cDNA sequences in Arabidopsis [16] and  28,000 in rice [17] to the corresponding genomes.
Inspection of the mapping results indicates that there are 40 miRNA precursors located within full-length cDNA mapped loci in Arabidopsis.
Further aligning the mapped regions to the annotated gene models revealed that out of the 40 miR- NAs, one resides in the 50 UTR of protein-coding genes, one in exonic region, 13 in the intronic region, and four in the 30 UTR (Figure 1).
Because these miRNAs are embedded within other genes and likely controlled by the host gene promoter [21], they were excluded from further analysis.
For the 21 miR- NAs mapped to full-length cDNA and intergenic region, we consider the 50 end of the corresponding full length-cDNA se- quence as the TSS for the miRNA.
Combining this data with the previous dataset [15], we came up with a total of 62 miR- NAs with experimentally-determined TSSs in Arabidopsis.
In rice, 157 miRNA precursors were found to be supported by full-length cDNA sequences.

After excluding miRNAs embedded in protein-coding genes, 55 miRNAs in rice were found in intergenic regions and their TSSs were as- signed based on the full-length cDNA sequences.
Even though the sample size is small for both species, it is interesting to no- tice that the proportions of miRNAs mapped to the introns and the intergenic regions are reversed in rice compared to those in Arabidopsis.
It is currently unknown whether this phe- nomenon reﬂects different genome organization of miRNAs genes in the two species or is related to the quality of miRNA annotation.
DNA features at the miRNA TSSs  To systematically compare miRNA promoters between Ara- bidopsis and rice, we ﬁrst calculated the distance from the TSS to the ﬁrst nucleotide of the miRNA precursors.
Consis- tent with the compact genome, more than 85% miRNAs in Arabidopsis have a distance between TSS and the stem-loop   58  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 56 60  -14  -15  -16  -17  -18  -19  -20  -21  ) l o m  / l  a c k (   e g n a h c   y g r e n e e e r F     -22 -1500  Arabidopsis miRNA Arabidopsis random Rice miRNA Rice random  -1000  -500  0  500  1000  1500  Relative distance to TSS (bp)  Figure 3 Comparison of AFE proﬁles in the vicinity of miRNA TSS in Arabidopsis and rice AFE proﬁles were generated over the  1500 to +1500 bp region with respect to TSS of miRNAs using a sliding window approach.

structured precursor of  1 kb.
This distance is less than 200 bp for more than 70% miRNAs in Arabidopsis (Figure 2).
By contrast, just over one third miRNAs in rice have their TSSs within 200 bp from the precursors and this distance can be as far as more than 3 kb (Figure 2).
Therefore, this anal- ysis indicates that, if our ﬁnding is applicable to all miRNAs, it is not suitable to use the ﬁrst nucleotide of the miRNA precur- sor as the surrogate for TSS in functional studies of the pro- moters in rice.
We next compared the DNA structural features around miRNA TSSs between Arabidopsis and rice.
To this end, aver- age free energy (AFE) proﬁles in DNA melting were generated for genomic regions at the vicinity of TSSs in both plants.
Using random sequences as a control, we found that Arabidop- sis miRNAs exhibit higher AFE ( 1.5 kcal/mol) upstream of the TSS than the downstream region (Figure 3).
Further, a sharp spike immediately upstream of the TSS is observed (Fig- ure 3), similar to what was reported for protein-coding genes in Arabidopsis [22].
As previously reported [22], DNA corre- sponding to the spike was found to be enriched with several AT-rich tetramers such as TATA-box.
Overall, the AFE pro- ﬁle around the TSS of miRNAs is consistent with the regula- tory is thermodynamically less stable than the downstream tran- scribed region to favor transcription factor binding and tran- scription initiation.
landscape  promoter  region  that  the  In rice, AFE proﬁles for both the genomic control and the miRNAs have lower values than those in Arabidopsis (Fig- ure 3).
As GC-rich sequences tend to be more stable in DNA melting, this observation could be accounted for by the higher GC content in the rice genome.
Compared to genomic control, signiﬁcant AFE changes ( 3 kcal/mol) between upstream and downstream regions of TSS were observed in rice as well as the spike immediately upstream of TSS (Figure 3).
Taken together, the AFE proﬁles around TSS indicate high similarity of DNA structural features between miRNA genes in Arabidopsis and rice and between miRNAs and protein-coding genes.
Analyzing the cis-regulatory elements in miRNA promoters  The TSS information for miRNAs in Arabidopsis and rice en- abled us to precisely pinpoint the promoter region and study  the composition of cis-regulatory motifs.
Previously, 99 PWM derived from known transcription factor binding sites were used to search 52 miRNA promoters in Arabidopsis [13].
It was shown that 90% of predicted cis-elements were within the 800 bp upstream region from TSS and that four cis-elements, TATA-box, AtMYC2, ARF, and SORLREP3 were most enriched in miRNA promoters based on posterior probability against random genomic sequences [13].
In this study, we used DNA fragment corresponding to the 1 kb up- stream region from TSS to comprehensively identify putative cis-regulatory elements.
Using the same PWM procedure, we analyzed miRNA promoters in both Arabidopsis and rice.
We found from the expanded Arabidopsis miRNA dataset that three of the four motifs (except ARF) were indeed over-repre- sented in miRNA promoters.
Additionally, we found four more cis-elements (G-box, RY-repeat, LTRE and AtMYB2) that also show signiﬁcant enrichment in Arabidopsis miRNA promoters probability (P(PmiRNA   Prandom)   0.85  Figure 4).
posterior  based  high  on  In rice, using the same cutoff of posterior probability (P(PmiRNA   Prandom)   0.85), we identiﬁed a total of 13 cis-elements enriched for miRNA promoters.
By comparing rice and Arabidopsis, we found that three of these elements, TATA-box, RY-repeat and SORLREP3, are enriched for miRNA promoters in both species (Figure 4), suggesting that these cis-elements are fundamental to the expression of miR- NAs.
However, the other 10 enriched cis-elements (LFY, RAV1A, CAAT-box, MYB4, W-box, GCC-box, RAV1B, MYB, CCA1 and Bellringer BS2) in rice were not found to be over-represented in Arabidopsis.
Conversely, the four cis- elements (AtMYC2, G-box, AtMYB2, and LTRE) enriched for Arabidopsis miRNAs were not over-represented in rice (Figure 4).
As the PWM were primarily derived from data in Arabidopsis, these ﬁndings will need to be validated with data from rice in the future.
Arabidopsis and rice are respective models for dicotyledon- ous and monocotyledonous plants.
In the current work, gen- ome-wide searches of full-length cDNA yielded a sizable number of TSSs for miRNAs in both species.
Our analysis indicates that the general structural features of miRNA pro- moters are similar to those of the protein-coding genes, which is consistent with the observation that most MIR genes are   Zhao X and Li L / miRNA Promoters in Arabidopsis and Rice  59  Both  Arabidopsis only  Rice only  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0  0.2  0.4  0.6  s e c n e u q e s   f  o     n o  i t r o p o r P  0.8  TATA-box  SORLREP3 RY-repeat AtMYC2  AtMYB2 G-box  LTRE  CAAT-box RAV1-A MYB4 LFY  GCC-box W-box  RAV1-B  Arabidopsis Rice Random  MYB  Bellringer BS2 CCA1  Over-represented cis -elements in Arabidopsis  and rice  Figure 4 Over-represented cis-elements in miRNA promoters Upstream 1 kb regions from the TSS of miRNAs in Arabidopsis and rice were scanned for cis-elements using 99 PWM.
Compared to random genomic sequences in the two species, cis-elements with posterior probability (PmiRNA   Prandom) greater than 0.85 were considered to be over-represented in miRNA promoters.
Proportion of miRNA promoters containing a given cis-element is shown as blue (Arabidopsis) and red (rice) bars while proportion of the random genome loci containing these cis-elements is shown as blank bars.

transcribed by RNA polymerase II [15,23,24].
Based on avail- able PWM, cross-species comparison suggests that putative cis-regulatory elements in miRNA promoters display different degree of conservation.
It is believed that new miRNAs have continuously appeared during evolution.
These miRNAs, once incorporated into the gene regulatory networks, could generate genetic novelty in different plant lineages if their regulatory re- gions are different.
Additional studies aimed at determining the precise function of the cis-elements should provide further insight into the complexity and evolution of miRNA-mediated gene networks in plants.
Methods  Data source  Annotated whole genome sequences, intron sequences and other gene model features of Arabidopsis and rice used in this study were downloaded from release 10 of The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) database (http://www.arabid- opsis.org/) and release 6.1 of the Rice Genome Annotation Project (http://www.rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/).
Arabidopsis and rice miRNA datasets were obtained from the miRBase [20] (release 19.0  http://www.mirbase.org/).
Full-length cDNA sequences in Arabidopsis [16] and rice [17] were downloaded from http://www.rarge.psc.riken.jp/ and http://www.cdna01.d- na.affrc.go.jp/cDNA/, respectively.
Mapping of full-length cDNA sequences  The  155,000 full-length cDNA sequences from Arabidopsis and  28,000 from rice were mapped to the corresponding gen- ome assemblies using the BLAT program [25].
Following pre- viously-reported criteria [18], only alignment has  90%  coverage and  95% identity was accepted.
Only the sequence hit with the highest score was considered as the correctly- mapped locus and the genomic position was recorded [18].
Full-length cDNA sequences that can be mapped to more than one locus with similarly high scores were excluded.
Generation of AFE proﬁles  The 62 and 55 miRNA loci in Arabidopsis and rice, respec- tively, were aligned within each group with the TSS set as the 0 position.
The genomic sequences in the  1500 to 1500 re- gion relative to the TSS were scanned by calculating the mean value of free energy in DNA melting at each position to gener- ate the AFE proﬁles.
The calculation was performed using dinucleotide parameters in DNA melting based on previous models [26,27].
A previously-described method was then em- ployed to reduce noise [22], in which the dinucleotide parame- ters were averaged over a 15 bp sliding window with one nucleotide step.
After that, the mean value assigned to the mid- point of each window was used to generate the AFE proﬁle over the entire sequences.
As a control in both Arabidopsis and rice, 1000 3-kb-long genomic sequences were randomly se- lected and subject to the same AFE proﬁling procedure.
Analysis of cis-elements  A previously-described method [13] was followed to identify putative cis-regulatory elements in the miRNA promoters.
In brief, PWM for 99 transcription factor binding sites [13] were used to scan the 1 kb region upstream of the TSS for 62 and 55 miRNA genes in Arabidopsis and rice.
Threshold employed for a speciﬁc matrix was set as the lowest score from using the matrix against all validated binding sites.
As controls, 1000 genomic se- quences (1 kb long each) from Arabidopsis and rice were ran- domly selected and subject to PWM analysis.
For each cis- element identiﬁed in the miRNA promoters, proportion of se- quences found to contain at least one copy of the cis-element was calculated for miRNA genes (PmiRNA) and the random se- quences (Prandom) in both species.
Posterior probability for two comparisons (PmiRNA   Prandom and PmiRNA   Prandom) was calculated using 10,000 times Monte Carlo simu- lation in Matlab.
For a given cis-element, if the posterior prob- ability of (PmiRNA   Prandom) is greater than 0.85, it was considered to be enriched in miRNA promoters.
