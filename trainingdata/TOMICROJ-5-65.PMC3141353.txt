Abstract: Typical and atypical Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) promote attaching-effacing lesions in intestinal 
cells  but  only  typical  EPEC  carry  the  EPEC  adherence  factor  plasmid.  Atypical  EPEC  (aEPEC)  are  emerging  agents  of 
acute  and  persistent  diarrhea  worldwide.  We  aimed  at  comparing  the  ability  of  two  aEPEC  strains,  1711-4  (serotype 
O51:H40) and 3991-1 (serotype O non-typeable:non-motile) to invade, persist inside Caco-2 and T84 cells, and to induce 
IL-8 production. Typical EPEC strain E2348/69 was used for comparisons. The strains associated more significantly with 
T84  than  with  Caco-2  cells,  with  3991-1  being  the  most  adherent  (P  <  0.001).  In  contrast,  aEPEC  1711-4  was  signifi-
cantly  more  invasive  than  the  other  strains  in  both  cell  lines,  and  was  found  within  vacuoles  near  the  basolateral  cell  
surfaces.  Strains  persisted  within  both  cell  lines  for  at  least  48  hours,  but  the  persistence  index  was  higher  for  3991-1  
in  Caco-2  cells.  IL-8  production  was  significantly  higher  from  Caco-2  cells  infected  with  1711-4  for  at  least  48  hours  
(P < 0.001), and from T84 cells after 24 and 48 h than with the other strains (P = 0.001). We demonstrated that aEPEC are 
heterogeneous in various aspects of their interaction with enterocytes in vitro.

INTRODUCTION 

  Enteropathogenic  Escherichia  coli  (EPEC)  are  currently 
classified  in  two  subgroups,  based  on  the  presence  of  the 
EPEC  adherence  factor  plasmid  (pEAF),  in  typical  EPEC 
(tEPEC),  and  those  without  in  atypical  EPEC  (aEPEC)  [1, 
2]. This plasmid contains the bfp operon encoding the bundle 
forming  pilus  (BFP),  a  fimbrial  structure  involved  in  the 
production  of  the  localized  adherence  phenotype  on  HeLa 
and HEp-2 cells. This phenotype  is not produced by  aEPEC 
strains due to their inability to produce BFP [3]. 

 
aEPEC are emerging pathogens associated with acute and 
persistent  diarrhea  affecting  children  and  adults  even  in  de-
veloping  countries  [4-9].  aEPEC  promote  attaching-effacing 
(A/E)  lesions  in  intestinal  cells  indistinguishable  from  those 
of  tEPEC  [2,  6,  10].  The  essential  virulence  determinant  of 
both  EPEC  subgroups  is  the  chromosomal  pathogenicity 
island  LEE  (Locus  of  Enterocyte  Effacement).  This  locus

contains  the  genes  that  code  for  effector  proteins  implicated 
in the formation of A/E lesions in eukaryotic cells, character-
ized by intimate adherence, local microvillus effacement and 
accumulation of polymerized actin beneath adherent bacteria 
forming structures which resemble pedestals [1]. 

  EPEC  strains  are  not  considered  typical  invasive  patho-
gens,  despite  the  fact  that  some  tEPEC  strains  were  found 
within eukaryotic cells  in vitro and  ex  vivo [11-13]. In addi-
tion,  recent  publications  have  provided  evidence  that  some 
aEPEC strains may show varying degrees of enterocyte inva-
sion  in  vitro  [14-16],  with  most  aEPEC  strains  tested  being 
more  invasive  than  tEPEC  prototype  strain  E2348/69  [15, 
17].  

 
In  a  survey  on  the  aetiology  of  diarrhea  undertaken  in 
three  different  cities  in  the  Southeast  region  of  Brazil,  the 
most  prevalent  aEPEC  serotype  among  typable  strains  was 
O51:H40  (10%  of  all  isolates),  while  non-motile  strains 
comprised 25% of all isolates [5]. Nguyen and colleagues [7] 
have  provided  epidemiological  evidence  that  patients  in-
fected  with  aEPEC  are  more  prone  to  have  prolonged  diar-
rhea  than  those  infected  with  tEPEC,  but  the  virulence  fac-
tors associated with this finding are not well established.

In  a  recent  publication,  we  have  demonstrated  that,  be-
sides promoting A/E lesions, aEPEC strain 1711-4 (serotype 
O51:H40) invades and induces IL-8 production in differenti-
ated  intestinal  Caco-2  and  T84  cells  through  a  flagella-
dependent  pathway  [16].  This  finding  is  consistent  with  the 
fact  that  Toll-like  receptor  5  (TLR5)  recognizes  bacterial 
flagellin  and  activates  host  inflammatory  responses,  thereby 
inducing enterocytes to produce IL-8 [18, 19]. In addition, it 
has  been  shown  that  aEPEC  strain  3991-1  (O  non-typable) 
induces  mucous  hyper-secretion  in  vitro  and  in  rabbit  ileal 
loops [20]. However it is currently not known whether these 
strains  can  persist  in  the  intracellular  compartment.  Besides 
representing  a  mechanism  of  escape  from  the  host  immune 
response,  permanence  in  the  intracellular  milieu  after  inva-
sion could be  a way  to promote persistent disease or to pro-
long  the  patients’  carrier  state.  Furthermore,  as  aEPEC 
strains  are  heterogeneous  in  various  features  [5],  it  is  not 
known whether aEPEC 3991-1 also invades and induces IL-
8  production in  vitro.  We  aimed  at  comparing  the  ability  of 
two  aEPEC  strains  (3991-1;  1711-4)  to  invade  and  persist 
inside  Caco-2  and  T84  cells,  as  well  as  to  induce  IL-8  
production.  Prototype  tEPEC  strain  E2348/69  (serotype 
O127:H6) was also used for comparisons. 

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY 

Bacterial Strains  

 
aEPEC  strains  1711-4  (serotype  O51:H40)  and  3991-1 
non-typable,  non-motile  (serotype  NT:NM)  [21]  and  tEPEC 
prototype  strain  E2348/69  (serotype  O127:H6)  were  culti-
vated overnight at 37ºC in Luria Bertani (LB) broth. 

EUKARYOTIC CELL CULTURE 

  Caco-2  and  T84  cells  were  cultivated  respectively  in 
Dulbecco’s  minimal  Eagle  medium  (DMEM)  (Gibco-BRL) 
supplemented  with  20%  fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS)  (Gibco-
BRL),  1%  nonessential  amino  acids  and  DMEM/NUT.MIX 
F12  Glutamax-1  medium  (Gibco-BRL)  supplemented  with 
10%  FBS,  both  with  1%  penicillin-streptomycin.  Cultures 
were incubated at 37ºC in 5% CO2 - 95% air atmosphere and 
then  seeded  (105 cells/well)  into  6-well  plates  and  incubated 
for 10 days.  

MONOLAYER INFECTION 

 
Forty  microliters  of  bacterial  suspension  from  LB  broth 
(107  CFU/ml)  were  added  to  each  monolayer  prior  to  cen-
trifugation  for  5  min  at  730  x  g.  After  incubation  for  3  h  at 
37ºC  in  5%  CO2  –  95%  air  atmosphere,  monolayers  were 
washed  with  sterile  phosphate  buffered  saline  (PBS).  To 
evaluate adhesion, 1% Triton X-100 was added to a group of 
monolayers  before  incubation  at  room  temperature  for  30 
min.  To  evaluate  invasion  ability,  a  second  group  of  mono-
layers  was  further  incubated  for  2  h  in  the  presence  of  100 
μg/ml  of  gentamicin  (Sigma).  A  subset  of  these  monolayers 
was washed and then  lysed as described above. The remain-
ing  monolayers  were  incubated  in  DMEM  plus  FBS  and  10 
(cid:1)g/ml  of  gentamicin  for  48  h,  and  then  lysed.  All  lysates 
were  serially  diluted  and  plated  on  LB  agar  plates,  which 
were incubated at 37ºC for 24 h with subsequent counting of 
the number of colony forming units (CFU). The percentages 
of  cell-associated  bacteria,  which  survived  after  treatment 

Sampaio et al. 

with  gentamicin  were  determined  [22].  Cell-association  in-
dexes  (AX)  were  calculated  using  the  following  equation: 
(AB/INOC) x 100, where AB is the number of cell-associated 
bacteria,  which  includes  adhered  and  intracellular  bacteria 
and INOC is the number of bacteria in initial inoculums. AX 
represents the percentage of inoculated bacteria that adhered 
to  and/or  invaded  eukaryotic  cells  until  three  hours  after  in-
fection. 

 
Invasion  indexes  (INVX)  were  calculated  using  the  fol-
lowing equation: (ICB/AB) x 100, where ICB  is the number 
of  intracellular  bacteria.  INVX  represents  the  percentage  of 
cell-associated bacteria that invaded eukaryotic cells. Persis-
tence  indexes  after  48  h  infection  (PIX48)  were  calculated 
using  the  following  equation:  PIX48  =  (ICB48/ICB3)  x  100, 
where  ICB3  and  ICB48  are  respectively  the  number  of  intra-
cellular bacteria at 3 and 48 h after infection. All assays were 
performed three times in triplicates.  

TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (TEM) 

  Differentiated  Caco-2  and  T84  cells  were  infected  as 
described above, except that preparations were not submitted 
to  centrifugation.  Preparations  were  rinsed  in  PBS,  fixed 
with  2.5%  glutaraldehyde  in  0.1  M  cacodylate  buffer  (pH 
7.2), post fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated through 
a  series  of  graded  ethanol  solutions  and  propylene  oxide,  
and  embedded  in  Araldite®.  Ultra-thin  sections  were  stained 
with  2.0%  uranyl  acetate  and  2.5%  lead  citrate,  and  exam-
ined  in  a  transmission  electron  microscope  (LEO  906E, 
Zeiss) at 80 kV. 

IL-8 SECRETION 

  Cell cultures supernatants were  collected at 3, 24 and 48 
h  after  infection.  IL-8  concentrations  were  measured  using 
the  Human  IL-8  Duo  Set  Elisa  Development  System  kit 
(R&D Systems).  

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 

  All  statistical  analyses  were  performed  with  Prism  
version  5.03  from  GraphPad  Software  Inc.,  USA.  ANOVA 
and  Bonferroni’s  post-hoc  tests  were  applied  to  evaluate  
all  results.  A  statistical  significance  of  95%  was  applied  
((cid:3) (cid:2) 0.05). 

RESULTS 

  To  compare  the  invasive  ability  of  both  aEPEC  strains 
and the tEPEC prototype strain E2348/69, we first evaluated 
their  efficiency  in  associating  (adhering  and  invading)  with 
Caco-2 and T84 intestinal cells. All three strains tested asso-
ciated  more  efficiently  with  the  T84  cell  line  than  with  the 
Caco-2 cell line (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1).  The Association  index 
(AX)  of  aEPEC  3991-1  in  T84  cells  (26.7%)  was  signifi-
cantly  greater  than  that  observed  in  Caco-2  cells  (1.6%)  
(P  <  0.001).  Likewise,  the  AXs  of  aEPEC  1711-4  (7.0%)  
and  tEPEC  E2348/69  (5%)  in  T84  cells  were  greater  than 
those  observed  in  Caco-2  cells  (1.4%  and  2.0%,  respec-
tively),  although  this  difference  was  not  statistically  signifi-
cant (P > 0.05).  

  The  AX  obtained  with  aEPEC  3991-1  in  T84  cells  was 
significantly higher than those observed with aEPEC 1711-4

and tEPEC E2348/69 (P  = 0.004). However,  the AXs of the 
strains  in  Caco-2  cells  showed  no  significant  differences  (P 
= 0.09) (Fig. 1). 

  Although  in  general  the  Invasion  Indexes  (INVX)  ob-
tained after gentamicin treatment (which eliminates extracel-
lular  bacteria)  were  higher  in  Caco-2  than  in  T84  cells,  but 
no  statistically  significant  differences  were  found  between 
them  (P  =  0.50)  (Fig.  2).  In  Caco-2  cells  aEPEC  1711-4 
showed  the  highest  INVX  (14.8%)  compared  to  1.4%  and 
3.2%  for  aEPEC  3991-1  and  tEPEC  E2348/69,  respectively 
(P  =  0.006).  In  T84  cells,  the  INVX  of  aEPEC  1711-4 
(4.8%) was significantly higher than those of aEPEC 3991-1 
(0.2%) and tEPEC E2348/69 (1.8%) (P (cid:1) 0.001) (Fig. 2). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  The  association  of  the  aEPEC  strains  with  intestinal 
Caco-2  and  T84  cells  at  three  and  six  hours  after  infection 
was  analysed  by  TEM  (Fig.  3).  Like  tEPEC  E2348/69  (not 
shown),  both  aEPEC  strains  formed  bacterial  clusters  at  the 
apical surfaces  three hours  after infection with characteristic 
A/E lesions (Fig. 3 A to D). After three hours, some aEPEC 
1711-4 bacteria were seen partially internalised (Fig 3 A and 
C).  In  both  Caco-2  and  T84  cell  lines,  internalised  bacteria 
were observed six hours after infection, however, in contrast 
to  aEPEC  3991-1,  aEPEC  1711-4  bacteria  were  seen  within 
vacuoles  located  close  to  the  basolateral  surface  of  the  en-
terocytes,  forming  pedestal-like  structures  around  these 
vacuoles (Fig 3 E and G).  

  We  next  examined  the  presence  of  bacteria  within  en-
terocytes, 48 h  after infection, as an  indication of  the poten-
tial  of  strains  to  persist  in  the  intracellular  compartment. 
During  these  experiments,  enterocytes  were  maintained  in 
media containing gentamicin that killed extracellular bacteria 
that occasionally escaped from them. Consequently, the Per-
sistence Index (PIX48) could result from two processes: bac-
terial  proliferation  and  bacterial  death.  For  all  strains  tested, 
the  PIX48  was  higher  in  Caco-2  than  in  T84  cells,  but  only 
aEPEC  3991-1  showed  a  statistically  significant  difference 
in  PIX48  between  Caco-2  and  T84  cells  (P  =  0.03)  (Fig.  4). 
The  PIX48  in  Caco-2  cells  were  29.1%  for  aEPEC  3991-1, 
11.1% for aEPEC 1711-4 and 8.8% for tEPEC E2348/69, but 
these differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.09) 
(Fig. 4). Likewise,  there were no statistically significant dif-
ferences  when  PIX48  of  the  strains  in  T84  cells  were  com-
pared  (P  =  0.17).  The  basal  levels  of  IL-8  production  from 
supernatants of the two different cell lines differed markedly 
and varied, from 8 to 26 pg/ml and from 114 to 156 pg/ml, in 
Caco-2  and  T84  cells,  respectively.  The  Caco-2  cells  inocu-
lated  with  aEPEC  1711-4  produced  IL-8  at  levels  of  416  ± 
115 pg/ml at 48 h and significantly greater than that of Caco-
2  cells  inoculated  with  aEPEC  3991-1  or  tEPEC  E2348/69 
(P (cid:1) 0.001) over all time periods tested (Fig. 5A). In contrast 
there was no statistical significance between IL-8 production 
from Caco-2 cells inoculated with aEPEC 3991-1 and tEPEC 
E2348/69 (P > 0.05). For T84 cells, highest IL-8 levels were 
also detected from cells inoculated with aEPEC 1711-4 in all 
periods  examined  (Fig.  5B).  Three  hours  after  infection,  a 
statistically  significant  difference  was  found  only  between 
aEPEC strains 1711-4 (181 ± 52 pg/ml) and 3991-1 (47 ± 13 
pg/ml)  (P  =  0.05;  95%  CI  9.7  –  259.6).  Twenty  four  hours 
after inoculation, IL-8  level  induced by aEPEC 1711-4 (484 
pg/ml)  was  significantly  higher  than  those  induced  by  the 
other  strains  (P  (cid:1)  0.001;  95%  CI  191.7  –  516.2  when  com-
paring  1711-4  and  3991-1  strains).  Similar  results  were  ob-
served 48 h after infection, when  the IL-8 levels induced by 
aEPEC  1711-4  (501  ±  164  pg/ml)  was  significantly  higher 
than  observed  with  the  other  strains  (P  =  0.001;  95%  CI 
107.6  –  512.6  when  comparing  aEPEC  1711-4  and  3991-1 
strains).

DISCUSSION  

  Recent  studies  have  demonstrated  that  although  aEPEC 
are  heterogeneous  in  nature,  some  strains  are  truly  diarrhea-
genic  [6,  23].  Furthermore,  besides  the  characteristic  ability 
to  produce  A/E  lesions,  some  aEPEC  strains  may  produce 
additional  potential  virulence  mechanisms  as  compared  to

tEPEC  strains.  One  such  mechanism  is  the  ability  to  invade 
epithelial  cells  in  vitro  [14-16].  Different  degrees  of  inva-
siveness  have  been  ascribed  to  many  aEPEC  strains  but  not 
all aEPEC strains are invasive [8, 17, 24].

  We  have  recently  demonstrated  that  aEPEC  1711-4  ad-
heres,  invades  and stimulates IL-8 production in Caco-2 and 

T84  cells  in  vitro  with  partial  involvement  of  the  bacterial 
flagella  in  these  characteristics  [16].  In  addition,  we  have 
shown that the non-flagellated strain aEPEC 3991-1 induced 
mucous  hypersecretion  in  intestinal  HT29-MTX  cells,  a 
property  which  did  not  affect  its  limited  ability  to  invade 
these cells [20]. 

  Enterocyte  invasion  could  be  a  bacterial  mechanism  of 
escape  of  the  extracellular  immunological  response.  How-
ever,  so  far,  the  ability  of  these  strains  of  persisting  within 
the  intracellular  milieu  has  not  been  investigated.  We  con-
ducted the present study to compare, under the same experi-
mental  conditions,  the  ability  of  the  aEPEC  strains  1711-4 
and  3991-1  to  adhere,  invade  and  persist  within  enterocytes 
and  to  elicit  IL-8  production  for  at  least  48  hours.  Two  
distinct  enterocyte-derived  lineages  were  used  -  Caco-2  and 
T84  cells–  which  spontaneously  differentiate  in  vitro  and 
express  distinct  functional  and  structural  characteristics, 
mimicking  the  colonic  intestines  [25,  26].  In  order  to  avoid 
interference of flagella motility in the interaction assays, cell 
monolayers  were  centrifuged  immediately  after  inoculation. 
Under the same experimental conditions, aEPEC 3991-1 had 
a  higher  AX  in  T84  cells  than  aEPEC  1711-4  or  tEPEC 
E2348/69. This finding suggests that flagella may not be the 
main factor required for aEPEC association (adherence) with 
T84  cells.  Consequently,  other  factors  expressed  by  aEPEC, 
as  intimin,  the  Type  Three  Secretion  System  (EspA,  EspB 
and  EspD),  or  an  as  yet  unknown  virulence  factors,  could 
mediate this association.

aEPEC 1711-4 stimulated IL-8 levels at least three fold those of aEPEC 3991-1 or tEPEC E2348/69, in all periods tested. These differences 
were  statistically  significant  (P  (cid:1)  0.001).  (B)  -  IL-8  levels  induced  by  aEPEC  1711-4  at  3,  24  and  48  h  after  infection  were  significantly 
higher than those induced by the other strains (P = 0.001). 

 
In contrast to the AX data, the INVXs of all strains stud-
ied  were  higher  in  Caco-2  than  in  T84  cells,  although  these 
differences between tissue culture cells were not statistically 
significant.  The  aEPEC  strain  1711-4  presented  the  highest 
INVX  while  aEPEC  3991-1  had  the  lowest  INVX  in  both 
lineages. These findings are in accordance with our previous 
work  showing  that  flagella  are  necessary  for  the  efficient 
invasion  ability  of  aEPEC  1711-4  [16]  and  with  a  recent 
publication  demonstrating  the  importance  of  flagella  in  the 
invasion  of  eukaryotic  cells  by  EHEC  serotype  O113:H21 
[27]. However, since only one flagellated strain and one non-
flagellated  strain  were  tested,  it  is  not  possible  to  ascertain 
that  the  flagella  are  responsible  for  higher  aEPEC  invasion 
efficiency  until  additional  flagellated  and  non-flagellated 
aEPEC  strains  are  tested.  Furthermore,  aEPEC  strains  may 
differ  by  expressing  alternative  or  additional  effectors  that 
might determine diverse invasion efficiencies [28].  

  TEM  analysis  indicated  the  presence  of  intracellular 
aEPEC  in  Caco-2  and  T84  cells  6  h  after  infection.  The 
aEPEC strain 3991-1 did not appear  to readily  invade either 
tissue culture  cell  line and there was no evidence of vacuole 
invasion (Fig. 3). However, aEPEC 1711-4 was found within 
vacuoles  located  close  to  the  basolateral  face  of  both  T84 
and  Caco-2  cells.  In  addition,  a  protuberance  suggestive  of 
pedestal  formation  around  the  vacuole  membrane  was  ob-
served underneath adherent bacteria (Fig. 3). This finding  is 
consistent  with  a  previous  report  of  pedestal  formation  in 
HeLa and Caco-2 cells with  two aEPEC strains of serotypes 
ONT  (non-typable):HNM  (non-motile)  [15]  and  O111:H9 
[29], respectively. The invasive ability of the O111:H9 strain 
in  HeLa  and  Swiss  3T3  cells  has  been  shown  to  be  due  to 
EspT,  a  type  three  secretion  system  dependent  effector  pro-
tein  encoded  outside  the  LEE,  that  activates  the  mammalian 
GTPases  Rac1  and  Cdc42,  resulting  in  the  formation  of 
membrane  ruffles  and  lamelipodia  that  favoured  invasion 

[29].  Interestingly,  the  strains  of  the  present  study  lack  the 
EspT-encoding genes [30]. 

  High  levels  of  IL-8  were  found  24  and  48  h  after  infec-
tion,  when  all  extracellular  bacteria  had  been  eliminated  by 
the  action  of  gentamicin.  Our  findings  of  lowest  IL-8  levels 
induced  by  the  non-flagellated  aEPEC  3991-1  are  in  accor-
dance  with  recent  studies  suggesting  that  flagellin  is  the 
main  bacterial  inducer  of  IL-8  production  [16,  19,  31].  The 
finding  that  the  non-flagellated  strain  3991-1  induced  IL-8 
levels  similar  to  that  observed  with  the  flagellated  tEPEC 
E2348/69  supports  the  existence  of  a  flagellin  independent 
pathway  culminating  in  IL-8  production  stimulation.  Our 
findings  are  in  accordance  with  those  published  by  Sharma 
et  al.  [32]  who  demonstrated  that  culture  supernatants  from 
FliC-deficient mutants of a tEPEC strain were able to trigger 
IL-8  production  in  HT-29  monolayers.  We  cannot  exclude 
the possibility that the differences in IL-8 levels observed at 
24  and  48  h  are  due  to  a  heterogeneous  capacity  of  the 
strains, which are suppressing or stimulating  inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS) production,  since invasive pathogens 
can  activate  iNOS  production  in  the  absence  of  cytokine 
treatment.  Absence  of  iNOS  expression  in  Caco-2  cells  has 
been  shown  to  result  in  lack  of  phosphorylation-associated 
activation  of  NF-(cid:2)B  [33].  Another  possibility  is  that  the  in-
teraction  of  intimin  with  its  translocated  receptor  (Tir)  con-
tinues to occur while bacteria  are inside vacuoles, recruiting 
protein kinase C zeta, which is able to interact with and acti-
vate I(cid:2)B kinase. This interaction leads  to NF-(cid:2)B release and 
nuclear  translocation  resulting  in  IL-8  mRNA  transcription 
and IL-8 production. This could explain why aEPEC 1711-4, 
the  most  invasive  strain  studied,  elicited  the  highest  IL-8 
levels. 

  All  strains  persisted  in  the  intracellular  compartment  for 
at  least  48  h.  The  PIXs  for  all  strains  were  similar  in  both 

70    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 

cell  lineages,  except  for  aEPEC  3991-1  that  showed  higher 
PIX  in  Caco-2  cells.  Curiously,  the  highest  PIX  was  ob-
served  with  the  aEPEC  3991-1,  which  had  the  lowest  inva-
sion  index  and  IL-8  induction  capacity.  Modulation  of  in-
flammatory  response  resulting  in  lower  IL-8  induction  has 
already  been  described  for  a  tEPEC  strain  [32].  Moreover, 
other virulence factors  could  contribute to the higher persis-
tence  of  aEPEC  3991-1  inside  enterocytes.  Such  persistence 
may be relevant to establish the carrier state and protect bac-
teria against phagocytic cells or secretory antibodies.  

  Although  the  ability  to  invade  and  persist  inside  entero-
cytes has to be confirmed in vivo, these properties could con-
tribute  to  the  establishment  of  persistent  diarrhoea  in  some 
aEPEC infected patients. 

CONCLUSIONS 

  Our  data  suggest  that  the  aEPEC  pathotype  is  heteroge-
neous  regarding  its  ability  to  adhere,  invade,  persist  and 
elicit IL-8 production by enterocytes in vitro.
