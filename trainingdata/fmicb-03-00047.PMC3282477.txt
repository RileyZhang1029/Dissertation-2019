Cultivation-independent studies have shown that taxa belonging to the “deep-sea
hydrothermal vent euryarchaeota 2” (DHVE2)
lineage are widespread at deep-sea
hydrothermal vents. While this lineage appears to be a common and important mem-
ber of the microbial community at vent environments, relatively little is known about their
overall distribution and phylogenetic diversity. In this study, we examined the distribu-
tion, relative abundance, co-occurrence patterns, and phylogenetic diversity of cultivable
thermoacidophilic DHVE2 in deposits from globally distributed vent ﬁelds. Results of quan-
titative polymerase chain reaction assays with primers speciﬁc for the DHVE2 and Archaea
demonstrate the ubiquity of the DHVE2 at deep-sea vents and suggest that they are sig-
niﬁcant members of the archaeal communities of established vent deposit communities.
Local similarity analysis of pyrosequencing data revealed that the distribution of the DHVE2
was positively correlated with 10 other Euryarchaeota phylotypes and negatively correlated
with mostly Crenarchaeota phylotypes. Targeted cultivation efforts resulted in the isolation
of 12 axenic strains from six different vent ﬁelds, expanding the cultivable diversity of
this lineage to vents along the East Paciﬁc Rise and Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Eleven of these
isolates shared greater than 97% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with one another
and the only described isolate of the DHVE2, Aciduliprofundum boonei T469T. Sequenc-
ing and phylogenetic analysis of ﬁve protein-coding loci, atpA, EF-2, radA, rpoB, and secY,
revealed clustering of isolates according to geographic region of isolation. Overall, this study
increases our understanding of the distribution, abundance, and phylogenetic diversity of
the DHVE2.

INTRODUCTION
The diversity of Archaea associated with marine hydrothermal vent
habitats is unrivaled in any other ecosystem on Earth (Auguet
et al., 2009). Much of this diversity resides within the Eur-
yarchaeota where numerous cultivated and uncultivated lineages
appear to be endemic to the deep-sea. One such lineage is the
“deep-sea hydrothermal vent euryarchaeota 2”(DHVE2; Takai and
Horikoshi, 1999). Previously, our knowledge of the distribution
and diversity of the DHVE2 was based primarily on cultivation-
independent assessments (Table A1 in Appendix). These studies
established that the DHVE2 are widespread in marine hydrother-
mal environments and can account for up to 15% of the archaeal
16S rRNA gene sequences, suggesting that they are important
members of deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems (Reysenbach et al.,
2006). More recently, 16S rRNA gene cloning studies have shown
that certain types of deep-sea vent mineral deposits, namely hori-
zontal ﬂanges (shelf-like structures that form in some hydrother-
mal systems, Figure 1, Tivey, 2007), can harbor an even greater
proportion of DHVE2 16S rRNA gene sequences (Nunoura and
Takai, 2009).

The ﬁrst cultured representative of the DHVE2, Acidulipro-
fundum boonei T469T, was the ﬁrst obligate thermoacidophile

isolated from deep-sea vents despite the low pH of most hydrother-
mal ﬂuids (pH 2.8–4.5) and predictions of acidic microhabitats
within the walls of vent deposits (Tivey, 2004; Reysenbach et al.,
2006). Acidic habitats are generated in vent deposits by conductive
cooling of end-member ﬂuids or by transport of hydrothermal
ﬂuids outward across deposit walls by diffusion (Tivey, 2004).
However, when hydrothermal ﬂuids and seawater mix, either in
the subsurface or by advection across deposit walls, neutrality of
the ﬂuids is quickly reached resulting in most marine hydrother-
mal vent habitats being circumneutral. Therefore, the pH of
end-member ﬂuids and the degree of ﬂuid mixing within an
individual deposit are likely important factors in controlling the
distribution and abundance of thermoacidophilic DHVE2 both
within and between vent ﬁelds. Factors that inﬂuence the pH
of hydrothermal ﬂuids at the vent ﬁeld scale include the pres-
ence of organic sediments, which increases the pH of ﬂuids as
at the Guaymas Basin (GB), and inputs of magmatic volatiles
as observed in the low pH ﬂuids of the Mariner vent site along
the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC, Tivey, 2007). Further-
more, ﬂuid mixing styles can be inﬂuenced by the type of vent
deposit as hydrothermal ﬂuids associated with horizontal ﬂanges
are conductively cooled with little or no mixing of seawater,

Oceanographic Institution).

while the mixing styles of vertical chimney deposits are much
more variable (Tivey, 2004). Taken together, these factors suggest
that thermoacidophilic niches in hydrothermal vent deposits vary
not only across vent ﬁelds but also within any individual vent
ﬁeld.

Geologic processes such as signiﬁcant breaks in ridge axes (i.e.,
transform faults) or hotspots in hydrothermal activity can provide
barriers for dispersal and hence inﬂuence diversiﬁcation and speci-
ation. Such distribution patterns inﬂuenced by geologic processes
have been shown to play a signiﬁcant role in the biogeographical
patterns of deep-sea hydrothermal vent fauna (Van Dover et al.,
2002), but whether similar factors inﬂuence microbial distribution
patterns is less clear. Microbial biogeographical diversity patterns
have been reported for terrestrial geothermal springs (Papke et al.,
2003; Whitaker et al., 2003; Takacs-Vesbach et al., 2008; Wagner,
2010), yet there are relatively few studies that report the biogeog-
raphy of microorganisms at deep-sea hydrothermal vents (Holden
et al., 2001; Huber et al., 2006; Flores et al., 2011b). Here, we inves-
tigated the occurrence, abundance, and phylogenetic diversity of
the DHVE2 in hydrothermal vent deposits from several geochemi-
cally distinct and spatially distant vent ﬁelds to explore whether the
distribution patterns of this lineage are inﬂuenced by geographic
separation.

Paciﬁc Rise (EPR) in 2007, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in 2008,
the ELSC in 2009, and the GB in 2009. Once shipboard, individ-
ual samples were processed and stored anaerobically as previously
described (Götz et al., 2002; Moussard et al., 2004; Reysenbach
et al., 2006).

QUANTITATIVE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION
DNA from environmental samples was extracted from homoge-
nized mineral deposits [≈1.6–3.2 g (w/w)] using the Ultra Clean
Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories) according to the
modiﬁed protocol of Reysenbach et al. (2006). Quantitative PCR
(qPCR) was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions
using the Quantitect SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia,
CA, USA) and 0.8 μM ﬁnal primer concentrations, with melting
curves run at the end of each reaction to ensure product speciﬁcity.
Primers and thermocycling conditions were followed accord-
ing to Reysenbach et al. (2006). Standard curves (107–1010 gene
copies/μl) for both Archaea and the DHVE2 were generated from a
plasmid containing the nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence
of A. boonei T469T. All standards and samples were run in at least
duplicate reactions. Gene copy numbers presented were averaged
across replicates and normalized by the amount of material in
grams (w/w) extracted.

were ampliﬁed, pyrosequenced, trimmed, aligned, and clustered
at 97% sequence similarity as previously described (Flores et al.,
2011a). DHVE2 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identi-
ﬁed by performing BLAST searches (Altschul et al., 1990) using
representative sequences of each OTU against the 16S rRNA
gene of A. boonei T469T, selecting OTUs with greater than 95%
sequence similarity to A. boonei T469T and manually align-
ing sequences and generating phylogenetic trees in a custom
ARB database (Ludwig et al., 2004). For local similarity analy-
sis (LSA), a technique that explores co-varying relationships of
microbial species (or OTUs) to one another (Ruan et al., 2006), all
OTUs with greater than 100 sequences, including three DHVE2
OTUs, were normalized and imported into the LSA compute
tool (http://meta.cmb.usc.edu/). Results of LSA were trimmed
to include only the two most prevalent DHVE2 OTUs (ID no.’s
DHVE2-727 and DHVE2-1148), and other OTUs that were pos-
itively and negatively correlated (P < 0.05). Visualization of the
resulting interaction network was performed using Cytoscape
(Shannon et al., 2003). Correlated OTUs were classiﬁed to the
lowest taxonomic level that had a bootstrap value of ≥50% (Claes-
son et al., 2009) using the RDP-classiﬁer (Wang et al., 2007).

server (Meyer et al., 2008) or by contacting the corresponding

ENRICHMENT CULTURING, ISOLATION, AND PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
The anaerobic medium used for enrichments and isolation was
identical to that used by Reysenbach et al. (2006) in the isola-
tion of the thermoacidophile A. boonei T469T. Pure cultures were
obtained through multiple serial dilutions, and culture purity was
conﬁrmed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Genomic DNA
was extracted from isolated cultures using the DNeasy Tissue Kit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The 16S rRNA
gene of each isolate was ampliﬁed, puriﬁed, and sequenced as
described previously (Reysenbach et al., 2006). Nearly complete
16S rRNA gene sequences were assembled using the software Seq-
Man (DNASTAR, Inc.), compared to the NCBI non-redundant
database using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990), and aligned in
ARB (Ludwig et al., 2004) according to secondary structure con-
straints. Neighbor-joining (Olsen correction, 500 bootstrap repli-
cates) and maximum-likelihood (default parameters, 100 boot-
strap replicates) analyses were conducted in ARB (Ludwig et al.,

2004) and MEGA V 5.04 (Tamura et al., 2011), respectively, using
only unambiguous nucleotide positions for a diversity of Archaea
(789 nt).

MULTI-LOCUS SEQUENCE ANALYSIS
We used multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA; Gevers et al., 2005)
to further examine the phylogenetic divergence among isolates.
The protein-coding genes chosen for MLSA were: DNA repair
and recombination protein RadA, radA; ATP synthase, A subunit,
atpA; DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit B, rpoB; translation
elongation factor aEF-2, EF-2; and preprotein translocase, SecY
subunit, secY. These genes were chosen because they were pre-
viously used to investigate the relationships between taxa within
the Halobacteriales (Papke et al., 2011). The protein-coding genes
were distributed around the genome of A. boonei T469T (Table A2
in Appendix).

Primers

the PCR ampliﬁcation and sequencing of
the protein-coding loci were designed based on the protein-
coding genes in A. boonei T469T (NCBI # PRJNA43333),
and related Thermoplasmatales with sequenced genomes; Ther-
moplasma acidophilum (Accession: PRJNA61573), Thermo-
plasma volcanium (NCBI # PRJNA35129), Picrophilus torridus
(NCBI # PRJNA36697), and Ferroplasma acidarmanus (NCBI #
PRJNA35151). Initial PCR primers were designed by using the
oligonucleotide design tool from IDT SciTools (Integrated DNA
Technologies), and then modiﬁed based on the nucleotide and
amino acid conservation at potential primer regions (Table 1).
Primers were supplied by Invitrogen (Life Technologies). Ther-
mocycler conditions for the ampliﬁcation of the protein-coding
loci were 94˚C for 2 min; 30 cycles of: 94˚C for 45 s, annealing
temperature (Table 1) for 45 s, 72˚C for extension; then 72˚C for
5 min. Annealing temperatures were optimized for each primer
set (data not shown). PCR products were puriﬁed using the
UltraClean PCR Clean-Up Kit (MO BIO Laboratories) accord-
ing to manufacturer’s instructions. Puriﬁed PCR products were
used as templates for Sanger sequencing reactions. Electrophero-
grams of the protein-coding loci sequencing reads were ana-
lyzed and assembled using the software SeqMan (DNASTAR,
Inc.).

Nucleotide polymorphism and DNA sequence variation of the
protein-coding loci were calculated using the software DnaSP v
5.10.01 (Librado and Rozas, 2009) and MEGA v 5.04 (Tamura

of nucleotide sequence alleles, na; the number of polymorphic
nucleotide sites, Snt; the total number of mutations, eta; the
nucleotide diversity, Pi; the number of inferred primary protein
sequence alleles, npp; and the number of polymorphic amino acid
residues, Spp. Synonymous and non-synonymous positions and
substitutions were examined using DnaSP v 5.10.01 (Librado and
Rozas, 2009). MEGA v5.04 (Tamura et al., 2011) was used to eval-
uate models for nucleotide substitution for each protein-coding
locus and to construct phylogenetic trees. The model having the
lowest goodness-of-ﬁt Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value
was used to generate a maximum-likelihood bootstrap consensus
tree based on 100 replicates. The initial tree for the maximum-
likelihood analysis was constructed automatically and the Nearest-
Neighbor-Interchange heuristic search method was used to search
for topologies that ﬁt the data better. In all analyses of sequence
diversity or phylogeny, the sequence length homologous among
all isolates was utilized.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
OCCURRENCE AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF THE DHVE2
To determine the occurrence and relative abundance of the
DHVE2 in deposits from geologically distinct vent ﬁelds, archaeal
and DHVE2 16S rRNA genes were quantiﬁed using qPCR.
Archaeal 16S rRNA genes were successfully ampliﬁed from 130
samples. Deposits from Tui Malila along the ELSC had, on aver-
age, the lowest archaeal copy number [8.35× 104 copies/g (w/w)]
while TAG along the MAR had the highest archaeal copy num-
ber [9.78× 107 copies/g (w/w); Table 2]. Although these values
cover a wide range, they are similar to archaeal abundances that
have been reported from other hydrothermal vent deposits (Takai

et al., 2001; Schrenk et al., 2003; Nakagawa et al., 2005; Zhou et al.,
2009). Using group speciﬁc primers, the DHVE2 were observed at
all vent ﬁelds but in only 60% (78/130) of samples analyzed. At
individual vent ﬁelds, the DHVE2 were most frequently observed
at Mariner (80% of samples), EPR (77.8%), and TAG (75%). In
contrast, they were detected in less than 50% of samples from Tui
Malila (37.5%), TowCam (42.9%), and the GB (48.1%; Table 2).
While their occurrence varied within an individual vent ﬁeld, these
results clearly illustrate the ubiquity of the DHVE2 at deep-sea
vents and suggest that differences in the geological properties that
inﬂuence end-member ﬂuid pH over the ranges we examined do
not inhibit colonization by the DHVE2 at these vent sites. For
example, the end-member ﬂuid pH at Mariner is around 2.5 while
at GB the ﬂuids are around pH 4.5. Yet niches are still available for
colonization of the DHVE2 at both sites. Assuming all members
of the DHVE2 are thermoacidophilic, then thermoacidophily is a
common ecological strategy in deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems.
In samples where the DHVE2 were not detected, the average
archaeal abundance was signiﬁcantly lower, at 3.64× 105 copies/g
(w/w), than in deposits where the DHVE2 were observed, which
averaged 3.34× 107 copies/g (P = 0.002, one-tailed T -test; data
not shown). Additionally, deposits where the DHVE2 were absent
were typically newly formed, thin-walled structures without an
obvious bioﬁlm on the exterior of the deposit. Previous work
demonstrated that, while Archaea are typically the initial coloniz-
ers of newly formed vent deposits, they are primarily autotrophic
with later colonization by heterotrophic Archaea and Bacteria
(Page et al., 2008). Consequently, the occurrence of the DHVE2 in
an individual deposit may be dependent upon the presence of a
mature microbial community from which to scavenge fermentable
peptides (Reysenbach and Flores, 2008). Older deposits also

Thermoacidophilic archaea of hydrothermal vents

generally have more deﬁned walls and ﬂuid conduits that would
help isolate the hydrothermal ﬂuids from seawater allowing for
less mixing of seawater and more conductive cooling of the ﬂuids.
Quantitative PCR was also used to determine the proportion of
the DHVE2 in the archaeal communities. Within individual vent
ﬁelds, the average percentage of DHVE2 16S rRNA gene copies
in the archaeal community ranged from 0.14% at Rainbow to
14.74% at Lucky Strike. Deposits from Mariner (12.69%), Tui
Malila (12.88%), and EPR (7.26%) also had, on average, a high
percentage of DHVE2 sequences within their archaeal commu-
nities (Table 2). This level of relative abundance is in agreement
with previous reports (Reysenbach et al., 2006; Nunoura and Takai,
2009) and implies that, when the DHVE2 are present, they can be
a signiﬁcant component of the archaeal community. However, it
is difﬁcult to compare their relative abundance to other archaeal
groups from previous studies because of differences in the methods
employed to determine abundances.

In general, individual samples having the highest proportion
of DHVE2 gene copies were typically ﬂanges (Figure 2), although
some exceptions were noticed (e.g., chimney sample EPR07-75).
As ﬂuids in ﬂanges are conductively cooled with little seawa-
ter mixing, these ﬂuids remain acidic as they cool to habitable
temperatures and percolate vertically through the structure gener-
ating relatively larger thermoacidic zones than predicted in vertical
chimney structures. Similar situations could conceivably develop
in thin-walled, chalcopyrite-lined chimneys (like Mariner-1652).
In a recent study, the DHVE2 accounted for nearly 46% of the
archaeal 16S rRNA gene diversity associated with a sample from a
ﬂange deposit from the Yonaguni Knoll IV hydrothermal ﬁeld in
the western Paciﬁc Ocean (Nunoura and Takai, 2009). Our data
further support the observation that ﬂanges may be “hotspots” for
the DHVE2 and likely, other thermoacidophiles.

Thermoacidophilic archaea of hydrothermal vents

Spatial variability on and in a deposit can be shaped by a num-
ber of factors including heterogeneous wall thickness, deposit
mineralogy, and ﬂuid ﬂow rate. For most of the deposits col-
lected and analyzed in this study, only the outer few millimeters
were sampled, as this is where the majority of microorganisms are
detected (Takai et al., 2001; Schrenk et al., 2003; Nakagawa et al.,
2005; Kormas et al., 2006; Nunoura and Takai, 2009). However, for
some of the deposits, we sampled exterior and interior sections of
chimneys and for ﬂanges, different spatial areas on the top, bot-
tom and edge. As a result of this sampling strategy, we have paired
samples from a few deposits that illustrate the spatial variability of
the DHVE2 associated with individual deposits. Spatial variability
on a deposit was best illustrated by a ﬂange structure collected
from the Tui Malila vent ﬁeld along the ELSC. On the bottom of
this deposit, the DHVE2 comprised over 70% of the archaeal 16S

CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS OF THE DHVE2 WITH OTHER ARCHAEA
In previous studies, barcoded pyrosequencing was used to char-
acterize the archaeal communities of numerous vent deposits
from geochemically and geographically distinct hydrothermal vent
ﬁelds MAR (Flores et al., 2011a), ELSC (Flores et al., in revi-
sion) and GB (Reysenbach, unpublished data). These large data
sets provided an opportunity to examine the co-occurrence of
the DHVE2 with other archaeal lineages using LSA. In total,
three OTUs were identiﬁed as the DHVE2 (ID no.’s DHVE2-
727, DHVE2-1148, and DHVE2-1137) and contained 3557, 1389,
and 120 sequences, respectively (Table 3). DHVE2-727 and
DHVE2-1148 were present in 89 and 65% of samples, respec-
tively, while DHVE2-1137 was present in only 10% of sam-
ples. Using LSA, we found that the occurrence of DHVE2-727
and DHVE2-1148 were positively correlated with one another
but not with DHVE2-1137 (Figure 3). Due to the low abun-
dance, relatively rare occurrence and lack of correlation with the

other DHVE2, results of LSA including DHVE2-1137 are not
presented.

The majority (9/10) of positively correlated OTUs were Eur-
yarchaeota (Figure 3; Table 3), but most (7 of 9) could not be
classiﬁed below the phylum making it difﬁcult to speculate on
potential ecological relationships between these OTUs and the
DHVE2. Some may be involved in syntrophic relationships with
the DHVE2 as has been proposed for the fermentative Thermococ-
cales (Bonch-Osmolovskaya and Stetter, 1991; Rinker and Kelly,
2000). Others may share the acidophilic strategy with the DHVE2
but utilize different carbon and/or energy sources that would allow
all to co-exist in the same biotope. For example, the two OTUs that
could be identiﬁed below the phylum level were related to Ther-
mogymnomonas and Ferroglobus (Table 3). Described species of
these two genera have somewhat complementary non-competing
lifestyles to the DHVE2 representative, the peptide-utilizing anaer-
obic acidophile, A. boonei T469T. Thermogymnomonas is a an
aerobic sugar-utilizing thermoacidophile (Itoh et al., 2007) and
therefore would occupy a slightly different acidic niche than A.
boonei T469T. The only described Ferroglobus species, F. placidus
uses a range of electron donors and acceptors, and can reduce
(Tor et al., 2001) and oxidize (Hafenbradl et al., 1996) iron, which
could provide relatives of this OTU metabolic ﬂexibility in the
dynamic hydrothermal environment. Because iron solubility is
greater at lower pH, the acidic niche may favor these potential
iron oxidizers.

In contrast to the positively correlated OTUs, all negatively cor-
related OTUs could be conﬁdently classiﬁed to at least the order
level (Figure 3; Table 3). Some of the negatively correlated OTUs
were related to the thermophilic neutrophiles,Archaeoglobus (Stet-
ter, 1988; Burggraf et al., 1990; Beeder et al., 1994) and Aeropyrum
(Sako et al., 1996). Since no known acidophilic members belong to
these genera, the negatively correlated OTUs may require different
physical conditions (e.g., neutral pH, more oxidizing conditions)
that do not permit anaerobic thermoacidophiles to grow. Thus, the
positively correlated OTUs may share the same acidophilic strategy
of the DHVE2 and are able to co-exist because of different carbon
and/or energy requirements, while the negatively correlated OTUs
may require different physical conditions.

PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY OF CULTURED DHVE2
To expand the cultured diversity of the DHVE2, numerous enrich-
ment cultures targeting thermoacidophiles were initiated from
samples collected in 2006 to 2009. In total, 12 axenic DHVE2 iso-
lates were obtained with 4 from the MAR (2 from Lucky Strike, 1
from Rainbow, 1 from TAG), 6 from the ELSC (1 from Tui Malila,
5 from Mariner), and 2 from the EPR (Table A3 in Appendix). All
isolates grew well (overnight growth) under anaerobic, thermoaci-
dophilic conditions but optimal growth conditions were not deter-
mined. No isolates were obtained from the GB despite the presence
of similar sequences in the pyrosequencing dataset (Table 2) and
detection of the DHVE2 (by ampliﬁcation with DHVE2 speciﬁc

Manipulating the pH, temperature, and organic substrates in order
to isolate the DHVE2 from GB samples were unsuccessful as
Thermococcus species typically outgrew the DHVE2.

With the exception of strain Lau09-1128, all isolates shared
greater than 97% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with one
another and A. boonei T469T (Figure 4). The high 16S rRNA
sequence similarity is comparable to the diversity reported for
Thermococcus species from different vent ﬁelds (e.g., Huber et al.,

1995, 2006; Canganella et al., 1998; Holden et al., 2001) but quite
different from deep-sea vent thermoacidophilic Deltaproteobac-
teria, which were clearly differentiated based on their 16S rRNA
gene sequences (Flores et al., 2011b). Despite the overall high
16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of all cultured DHVE2, the
isolates nonetheless clustered together based on the vent ﬁeld of
isolation (Figure 4). Other thermophilic archaeal lineages, most
notably the Sulfolobales (Whitaker et al., 2003; Reno et al., 2009)
and Thermococcales (Huber et al., 2006), did not exhibit such

clear biogeographical separation based only on 16S rRNA gene
sequences and required MLSA to resolve the biogeographical
relationships amongst strains.

MULTI-LOCUS SEQUENCE ANALYSIS
Likewise, we used MLSA to further assess the phylogenetic diver-
gence between the DHVE2 isolates. Protein-coding loci were
successfully ampliﬁed and sequenced from most, but not all of
the 12 isolates. In the MLSA of members of the Halobacteri-
ales, Papke et al. (2011) were similarly unable to obtain ampli-
ﬁcation from all strains. In our study, the radA and EF-2, loci
were not obtained from strains Lau09-1128, EPR-159, and EPR-
39, while secY could not be ampliﬁed from strain Lau09-1128.
Subsequent phylogenetic analyses revealed that all sequences
from strain Lau09-1128 were quite divergent (Figures 5A,B).
All protein-coding loci sequences were submitted to GenBank
(EF-2, JN375640 to JN375648; atpA, JN375649 to JN375660;
secY, JN375661 to JN375671; rpoB, JN375672 to JN375682; radA,
JN375683 to JN375692).

Remarkably high variation between geographic regions within
the protein-encoding genes was observed (Table 4). The average
nucleotide p-distance values, the proportion of nucleotide sites
at which two sequences being compared, are different considering
sequences from strains from different geographic regions (Π), var-
ied from 0.19 to 0.25 for the different protein-coding loci (Table 5).
The between-region Π values of 0.009–0.070 were observed in the
MLSA study of Sulfolobus isolates with ≥99.8% 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarity from terrestrial geothermal hot springs of Ice-
land, North America, and Kamchatka, Russia (Whitaker et al.,
2003). There were a total of 983 variable nucleotide sites over
3366 bp from ﬁve protein-coding loci examined (Table 4). If the
radA and EF-2 loci from strains EPR-159 and EPR-39 had been
obtained the total number of variable nt sites would likely be even
greater. By comparison, within 78 Sulfolobus strains, there were 124
variable nucleotide sites over 4111 bp from eight protein-coding
loci (Whitaker et al., 2003), and among 106 Thermoanaerobacter
uzonensis strains with ≥98% 16S rRNA sequence similarity, there
were 145 variable nucleotide positions over a total of 8005 nt sites
across eight protein-coding loci (Wagner, 2010). Thus, while the
16S rRNA similarity between all DHVE2 isolates (except strain
Lau09-1128) is high enough that they would likely be consid-
ered the same species, they are extremely divergent considering
several protein-coding loci and may actually represent different
species.
There were consistent differences in the G+ C% content of
the protein-coding loci from the DHVE2 isolates from different
regions with the G+ C% values from the ELSC < EPR < MAR
(Figure 6). For example, for the rpoB locus the average G+ C%
for isolates were 42.3% for the ELSC, 45% for EPR, and 49.1%
for MAR. Differences in the GC content among related strains
have been reported in previous studies and have been attrib-
uted to reductive evolution and gene loss (Rocap et al., 2003).
While it is possible that gene loss or gain may have inﬂuenced the
overall nucleotide composition among the DHVE2 isolates, it is
more likely that the GC content differences observed between the
DHVE2 isolates are due to regional codon usage bias differences
(Ermolaeva, 2001). This view is supported by the high proportion

FIGURE 6 | Regional G+ C% differences among protein-coding loci

values.

of synonymous nucleotide substitutions relative to the number
of possible synonymous nucleotide positions that were observed
in the pairwise analyses of the protein-coding loci from DHVE2
strains from different regions (Figure 7). For example, considering
the radA locus (334 bp length) from the ELSC and MAR isolates,
there are an average of 77.7 possible silent nucleotide substitution
sites and an average of 67.1 actual silent nucleotide substitutions
among the 20 pairwise comparisons (Figure 7A). Considering the
same radA locus, there are only six amino acid residue differences
(Table 4).

The slowly evolving 16S rRNA gene, as well as all of the protein-
coding loci, revealed regional clustering patterns for the DHVE2
isolates (Figures 4 and 5) suggesting an early origin of the differ-
entiation between ELSC, EPR, and MAR populations. Although
we only had a limited number of isolates, these observations
suggest divergent evolution of geographically isolated DHVE2
populations, i.e., allopatry (Whitaker, 2006). Additionally, some
evidence for biogeographical patterns within oceanic regions was
also noted. For example, most of the protein-coding loci from
strain MAR-641, obtained from the TAG vent ﬁeld of the MAR,
are phylogenetically different from the other strains obtained
from the Lucky Strike and Rainbow vent sites also along the
MAR (Figure 5). Intra-regional differences have been observed
in other studies of the spatial diversity patterns of microor-
ganisms from thermal environments (Petursdottir et al., 2000;
Hreggvidsson et al., 2006; Takacs-Vesbach et al., 2008; Wagner,
2010). With additional DHVE2 strains and genomes, the global
patterns of diversity of the DHVE2 could be explored in greater
detail. Based on the variation observed in the protein-coding genes,
which are part of the core genome for this lineage, extensive dif-
ferences in the variable genome (Tettelin et al., 2008) are also
expected.

CONCLUSION
Results from this study show that the DHVE2 are ubiquitous
in deep-sea hydrothermal environments and tend to co-occur
with other Euryarchaeota. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA
genes and protein-coding loci from 12 different DHVE2 isolates
revealed clear biogeographical clustering patterns indicative of

allopatric speciation. Assuming that all DHVE2 are thermoaci-
dophilic, then thermoacidophily is an important physiological
strategy for some microorganisms in these ecosystems. Factors
that seemed to inﬂuence the occurrence and abundance of the
DHVE2 within an individual vent ﬁeld include the age of the vent
deposit (as this is indicative of the maturity of the microbial com-
munity, Page et al., 2008), ﬂuid mixing style, and type of vent
structure (chimney vs. ﬂange). Other factors like deposit miner-
alogy, grazing by eukaryotes, and viruses may also be inﬂuencing
the biogeography of the DHVE2 but were not examined as part of
this study.
