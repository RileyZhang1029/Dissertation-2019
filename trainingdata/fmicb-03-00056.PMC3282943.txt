Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 is a facultative anaerobic bacterium capable of respir-
ing a multitude of electron acceptors, many of which require the Mtr respiratory pathway.
The core Mtr respiratory pathway includes a periplasmic c-type cytochrome (MtrA), an
integral outer-membrane β-barrel protein (MtrB), and an outer-membrane-anchored c-type
cytochrome (MtrC).Together, these components facilitate transfer of electrons from the c-
type cytochrome CymA in the cytoplasmic membrane to electron acceptors at and beyond
the outer-membrane. The genes encoding these core proteins have paralogs in the S.
oneidensis genome (mtrB and mtrA each have four while mtrC has three) and some of
the paralogs of mtrC and mtrA are able to form functional Mtr complexes. We demon-
strate that of the additional three mtrB paralogs found in the S. oneidensis genome, only
MtrE can replace MtrB to form a functional respiratory pathway to soluble iron(III) citrate.
We also evaluate which mtrC/mtrA paralog pairs (a total of 12 combinations) are able to
form functional complexes with endogenous levels of mtrB paralog expression. Finally, we
reconstruct all possible functional Mtr complexes and test them in a S. oneidensis mutant
strain where all paralogs have been eliminated from the genome. We ﬁnd that each combi-
nation tested with the exception of MtrA/MtrE/OmcA is able to reduce iron(III) citrate at a
level signiﬁcantly above background. The results presented here have implications toward
the evolution of anaerobic extracellular respiration in Shewanella and for future studies
looking to increase the rates of substrate reduction for water treatment, bioremediation,
or electricity production.

INTRODUCTION
Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 (MR-1) is a facultative anaero-
bic bacterium capable of respiring a diverse array of compounds.
MR-1 respiration can be harnessed for bioremediation of radioac-
tive heavy metals (Wall and Krumholz, 2006), removal of insoluble
metal oxides from wastewater (Fredrickson et al., 2008), and gen-
eration of electricity in microbial fuel cells (Lloyd et al., 2003;
Lovley, 2008). In respiring insoluble metals and electrodes, MR-1
has evolved a mechanism to transfer electrons from the cyto-
plasmic space to electron acceptors unable to cross the outer-
membrane (OM) termed extracellular respiration (Gralnick and
Newman, 2007). The respiratory diversity of MR-1 coupled with
well-established genetic tools have made this microbe a model
organism for understanding mechanisms of anaerobic respira-
tion; most notably extracellular respiration (Marsili et al., 2008;
Von Canstein et al., 2008; Coursolle et al., 2010).

The Mtr respiratory pathway of MR-1 contains interchangeable
proteins that can form distinct functional modules for the reduc-
tion of iron(III) citrate, iron oxide, ﬂavins, and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO; Bucking et al., 2010; Coursolle and Gralnick, 2010). A
general scheme for how the components of the Mtr respiratory
pathway facilitate electron ﬂow in MR-1 is shown in Figure 1. Elec-
tron transfer from the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) begins with
CymA, a CM-anchored tetraheme c-type cytochrome capable of

receiving electrons from the menaquinone pool (Myers and Myers,
1997). Also contained in each module is a periplasmic electron
carrier (PEC), which is a decaheme c-type cytochrome. There are
three known functional PECs encoded in the MR-1 genome by
mtrA, mtrD, and dmsE (Coursolle and Gralnick, 2010). DmsE is
primarily used in modules to reduce the terminal electron acceptor
DMSO (Gralnick et al., 2006), but has minor activity in modules
that reduce iron(III) citrate (Coursolle and Gralnick, 2010). MtrA
is the primary periplasmic component used by MR-1 when reduc-
ing iron(III) and ﬂavins, but overexpression of MtrD can restore
ferric citrate reduction rates to an mtrA mutant (Coursolle and
Gralnick, 2010). A fourth PEC is encoded in the MR-1 genome
(SO4360) but it has no demonstrated function to date. Recently,
small-angle X-ray scattering coupled with analytical ultracentrifu-
gation has resolved that MtrA is shaped like a “wire,” likely making
its purpose to shuttle electrons between CymA and OM proteins
(Firer-Sherwood et al., 2011). All functional iron(III)-reducing
modules also contain an outer-membrane cytochrome (OMC),
a decaheme c-type cytochrome which can be MtrC, MtrF, or
OmcA (Bucking et al., 2010; Coursolle and Gralnick, 2010). Due
to the severely impaired rate of soluble iron reduction in mutants
lacking all three OMCs, it has been concluded that all metal reduc-
tion occurs outside the cell, even when metal substrates are small
enough to penetrate OM porins (Bucking et al., 2010; Coursolle

Mtr reconstruction in MR-1

is a critical factor in how Mtr respiratory proteins function given
that oxidation and reduction is likely to occur in different active
sites of an electron transfer proteins. Second, chemical reductants
or electrodes rather than a native pathway must provide elec-
trons for puriﬁed proteins. Finally, substrate accessibility in vitro is
unhindered in the absence of cellular structure, therefore allowing
reactions to occur that may not reﬂect activity in a living system.
In vivo analysis remedies each of these described caveats.

In this study we constructed a S. oneidensis strain unable to
reduce Fe(III) citrate by ﬁrst deleting all genes identiﬁed in the
Mtr-pathway. Then, using a multi-gene complementation strat-
egy we add back various combinations of Mtr paralogs. In doing
this, we identify which of the 48 possible mtrC/mtrA/mtrB para-
log modules (from 4 PEC, 4 β-barrel, and 3 OMC paralogs) can
form functional iron(III)-reducing modules in vivo. Due to high
identity amongst most of these paralogs (Table 1), in conjunction
with previous studies demonstrating shared functionality between
paralogs (Bucking et al., 2010; Coursolle and Gralnick, 2010), we
expect many recombinant modules to transfer iron(III) reduc-
ing capability to our mutant missing all Mtr genes. We ﬁnd that in
reconstructed modules the PECs SO4360 and DmsE do not exhibit
signiﬁcant activity. We also ﬁnd that the predicted OM β-barrels
DmsF and SO4359 cannot complement an mtrB mutant. Lastly, we
discover that when functional modules are created, MtrDEF can
reduce Fe(III) citrate at approximately half the rate as MtrABC,
demonstrating for the ﬁrst time the functionality of a complete
iron-reducing module lacking MtrA, B, and C.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
BACTERIAL STRAINS AND MEDIA USED
MR-1 was originally isolated from Lake Oneida in New York
(Myers and Nealson, 1988; Venkateswaran et al., 1999). Strains and
plasmids used in this study are found in Table 2. Overnight cul-
tures were made from single colonies isolated from a frozen stock
inoculated into 2 mL of Luria–Bertani (LB) medium and grown
aerobically for 16 h. When necessary, Shewanella basal medium
(SBM) was used as minimal medium (Baron et al., 2009). Iron(III)
citrate was used as indicated as electron acceptor. Kanamycin was
used at a concentration of 50 μg/mL and ampicillin was used at a
concentration of 100 μg/mL when necessary. Diaminopimelic acid
(DAP) was used at a concentration of 360 μM for all growth of E.
coli strain WM3064. Overnight cultures of E. coli were made from
single colonies inoculated into 2 mL of LB and grown aerobically
for 16 h.

MUTANT CONSTRUCTION
Deletions in the MR-1 genome were made as previously described
(Hau et al., 2008; Coursolle et al., 2010). All gene deletions
were deigned to be in-frame to minimize polar effects on down-
stream genes. Brieﬂy, up and downstream fragments ﬂanking the
gene targeted for deletion were ligated into the suicide vector
pSMV3 and transferred into WM3064. After allowing the plasmid-
containing WM3064 strain to conjugate with the parent MR-1
strain, single recombinants were obtained by plating this mixture
to LB+ kanamycin plates. Double recombinants were obtained
by plating single recombinants onto LB+ 5% sucrose plates and
mutants screened by colony PCR from these plates. All mutants

and Gralnick, 2010). A structure of the OMC protein MtrF was
recently reported, identifying potential electron transfer pathways
directly to insoluble substrates and to soluble ﬂavin electron shut-
tles (Clarke et al., 2011). The remaining component of a functional
Mtr module is an integral membrane β-barrel protein that forms
a pore-like structure through the OM that may facilitate direct
interaction between PECs and OMCs (Beliaev and Saffarini, 1998;
Hartshorne et al., 2009). MtrB is the only protein known to exhibit
this function in the Mtr respiratory pathway, though three paralogs
(encoding MtrE, DmsF, and SO4359) occur in the genome of S.
oneidensis.

The biochemical capacities of several Mtr respiratory pathway
proteins have been interrogated in vitro. Both MtrC and OmcA
have been puriﬁed and demonstrated to exchange electrons with
each other and various forms of iron(III), ﬂavins, and electrodes
(Xiong et al., 2006; Shi et al., 2007; Wigginton et al., 2007; Wang
et al., 2008; Ross et al., 2009). MtrA has been heterologously
expressed in Escherichia coli and can be oxidized in the presence
of soluble iron(III; Pitts et al., 2003). Likewise, CymA was shown
to have soluble iron(III) reduction activity when expressed in E.
coli (Gescher et al., 2008). Components of the Mtr-pathway have
been puriﬁed and examined using protein ﬁlm voltammetry to
determine redox windows where electron transfer reactions are
favorable as single proteins (Firer-Sherwood et al., 2008) and as
complexes (Hartshorne et al., 2009). Three primary constraints
complicate comparisons between in vitro biochemical analysis
and in vivo function of Mtr respiratory proteins: ﬁrst, orienta-
tion of the protein cannot effectively be controlled. Orientation

were then veriﬁed to be kanamycin sensitive and all permanent
stocks retested by PCR using primers ﬂanking the targeted gene.
Primers used for deletions and complementation can be visualized
in Table A1 in Appendix.

COMPLEMENTATION
Single and multiple genes were complemented into various MR-
1 strains using the pBBR/pUC-BioBrick system, pBBR-BB (Vick
et al., 2011). Due to prior expression issues (Coursolle and Gral-
nick, 2010), 38 base pairs of upstream mtrA sequence, 53 base
pairs of upstream mtrC sequence, and 43 base pairs of upstream
mtrB sequence were included before mtrA, mtrC, and mtrB par-
alogs, respectively to normalize expression. Each gene is driven
by an individual lac promoter (Vick et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, each
gene was cloned into the pUC-BB vector, digested out, and ligated
into pBBR-BB sequentially. Genes cloned in top BBR-BB were
veriﬁed using PCR, restriction analysis (using XbaI and SpeI),
and sequencing. Primers used for complementation can be seen
in Table A1 in Appendix. When appropriate, heme stains were
performed to visualize the presence of c-type cytochromes (see
below).

IRON(III) CITRATE REDUCTION
Iron(III) citrate was used to test the Mtr-pathway constructs due
to the speed and dynamic range of the assay compared to Iron(III)
oxide (Coursolle and Gralnick, 2010). MR-1 strains were grown
in LB overnight and normalized to an optical density at 600 nm
of 0.35 in SBM. Thirty microliters of these cultures was then used
to inoculate 270 μL of SBM containing 20 mM lactate and 10 mM
iron(III) citrate in a 96-well plate. Iron(II) formation was moni-
tored over time as previously described (Coursolle and Gralnick,
2010) using ferrozine (Stookey, 1970). Between time points 96-
well plates were placed in an adapted anaerobic Petri dish holder
and ﬂushed with nitrogen for 15 min. Reduction rates were cal-
culated over the linear portion of each curve and normalized to
the amount of protein in each well. Protein concentrations were
calculated using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the
manufacturers protocol.

HEME STAINING
Cultures were grown overnight in SBM containing 20 mM lactate
and 10 mM iron(III) citrate and sonicated to lyse cells. Super-
natants were separated and tested for protein concentration. Ten
micrograms protein was loaded into each well of a 4–12% Bis–Tris
SDS PAGE protein gel (Invitrogen) and run at 110 V for 120 min.
The gels were then stained in a 3:7 6.3 mM tert -methylbenzadine
(TMBZ) in methanol: 0.25 M sodium acetate for 2 h. The gels
were visualized upon the addition of 30 mM hydrogen peroxide
for 15 min.

RESULTS
FUNCTIONALITY OF MtrB PARALOGS
To determine what mtrB paralogs are able to functionally replace
MtrB, we placed mtrB, mtrE, dmsF, and SO4359 under control
of a constitutive promoter on the expression vector pBBR1MCS-
2 (Kovach et al., 1995) and tested their ability to complement
an mtrB deletion strain for iron(III) citrate reduction activity.
Iron(III) citrate was used as a proxy for all Mtr activity due to
its fast reduction rate and electron shuttle independent reduc-
tion mechanism (Von Canstein et al., 2008; Coursolle et al., 2010).
Both MtrB and MtrE restored activity to levels slightly above wild
type with empty vector (Figure 2), implying that MtrE can func-
tionally replace MtrB. Neither expression of DmsF or SO4359 in
ΔmtrB raised iron(III) citrate reduction levels signiﬁcantly above
an empty vector control (Figure 2), indicating that these par-
alogs are not functional in metal reduction modules. Knowing that
only two mtrB paralogs have functionality during iron(III) citrate
reduction limits the number of total possible functional modules
to 24 allowing for less downstream plasmid construction.

MtrA/MtrC PAIRED INTERACTIONS
Previous studies have demonstrated that MtrD and DmsE can
functionally replace MtrA (Coursolle and Gralnick, 2010), while
MtrF and to a smaller extent OmcA can functionally replace MtrC
(Bucking et al., 2010; Coursolle and Gralnick, 2010). MtrC and
MtrA interact through the pore in the OM created by the β-barrel
MtrB protein (Hartshorne et al., 2009), yet remains unknown
which OMC/PEC paralog interactions are functional in vivo. To

test which pairs can functionally interact, we constructed a strain
of S. oneidensis missing all identiﬁed OMCs and PECs (mtrA,
mtrD, dmsE, SO4360, mtrC, mtrF, omcA, and cctA). After all genes
were individually removed, the recA gene was deleted from the

strain to nullify recombination between lac promoters driving
expression of OMCs and PECs tested (see below). The resultant
strain was named ΔMtr (Table 2). Functional characterization of
PEC and OMC pairs (12 total combinations) were cloned into

was deleted to ensure plasmid stability for testing complementa-
tion constructs. When the ﬁve functional OMC/PEC paralog com-
binations were introduced into ΔMtr/mtrE, which still expresses
mtrB, there was no signiﬁcant difference between when the same
combinations were complemented into ΔMtr (Figure 4). When
the same mtrA/mtrC paralog combinations were complemented
into ΔMtr/mtrB, all strains reduced iron(III) citrate at rates com-
parable to the empty vector control (data not shown). We can
therefore conclude that MtrE is not contributing to iron(III) cit-
rate reduction under these conditions and that MtrB is required
for the activities observed in Figure 4. However, since the relative
expression levels of mtrB and mtrE in these backgrounds are not
known, the ability of MtrE to function with OMC/PEC paralog
pairs could not be ruled out. To normalize expression levels of
MtrE and MtrB, we generated pBBR-BB constructs encoding all
three components: PEC, β-barrel, and OMC.

FUNCTIONAL Mtr MODULES
To determine which combinations of mtrC/mtrA/mtrB paralogs
could form functional iron-reducing complexes, a series of par-
alog modules were reconstructed. Ten mtrCAB paralog modules
were chosen because all OMC/PEC paralog combinations capable
of forming functional complexes had been identiﬁed (Figure 3C),
and only MtrB and MtrE appear to complement strains lacking
mtrB (Figure 2). To analyze the functionality of complexes, both
+
mtrB and mtrE were deleted from the ΔMtr parent strain (recA
)
and plasmids containing each of the 10 complexes to be tested were
placed in the resulting strain (ΔMtr/mtrB/mtrE) after removal of
recA. We found that each of these combinations resulted in strains
able to reduce iron(III) citrate at variable rates (Figure 5). The
lowest rates were observed for both constructs producing OmcA,
indicating that this protein has very little activity against iron(III)
citrate, agreeing with previous observations (Coursolle and Gral-
nick, 2010; Coursolle et al., 2010). As expected, MtrA/MtrB/MtrC
had the highest activity followed by MtrA/MtrB/MtrF. The results
are in agreement with recent data demonstrating that MtrF and
MtrC share similar activity (Bucking et al., 2010; Coursolle and
Gralnick, 2010) and likely a similar structure (Clarke et al., 2011).
All complemented strains expressing MtrA had higher reduction
rates when co-expressed with MtrB than MtrE. Likewise, com-
plemented strains expressing MtrD reduced iron(III) citrate at
the same rate or faster when co-expressed with MtrE. Overall,
we observed that all tested MtrA/MtrB/MtrC paralog combina-
tions were able to reduce iron(III) citrate with the exception of
MtrA/MtrE/OmcA, suggesting that MtrE is unable to facilitate
interaction between MtrA and OmcA.

DISCUSSION
We have reconstructed and identiﬁed components from the inven-
tory of mtrA, mtrB, and mtrC paralogs found in the genome of
S. oneidensis that function together to conduct electrons to sol-
uble iron(III) citrate. Together, the three protein components, a
PEC, β-barrel, and OMC form an electron conduit to the out-
side of the cell (Figure 1) where soluble and insoluble substrates
are reduced by S. oneidensis (Coursolle and Gralnick, 2010). The
apparent redundancy of these components is unusual, however
the degree of variation in the utility of these components in

the pBBR-BB. Each of the complemented strains was veriﬁed via
heme staining (Thomas et al., 1976) to express PEC and OMC par-
alogs. Figure 3A demonstrates that each of the 12 strains expressed
both a PEC and an OMC with covalently attached heme groups.
Interestingly, MtrA and SO4360 appear to be expressed at higher
levels than MtrD and DmsE, even though the same promoter and
ribosome-binding site drive expression of all four PECs. In the
same manner, MtrF appears to be present at lower levels in comple-
mented strains though the genes for all three OMCs share the same
promoter, RBS, and 35 base pair upstream sequence. The 12 com-
plemented strains were then evaluated for their ability to reduce
iron(III) citrate. Overall, ΔMtr strains expressing MtrC/MtrA,
MtrC/MtrD, MtrF/MtrA, MtrF/MtrD, and OmcA/MtrA were
able to reduce iron(III) citrate at a rate signiﬁcantly above an
empty vector control (Figures 3B,C), while other PEC/OMC pairs
did not. ΔMtr strains expressing MtrC/MtrA and MtrF/MtrA
reduced iron(III) citrate at rates comparable to MR-1, while the
other three functional combinations (MtrC/MtrD, MtrF/MtrD,
and OmcA/MtrA) resulted a rate signiﬁcantly lower than wild
type. Though we demonstrated activity of OMC/PEC pairs, we
could not yet determine which MtrB homolog was facilitating
interactions between the c-type cytochromes.

MtrB PARALOGS
Identiﬁcation of all functional PEC/OMC iron(III) citrate respi-
ratory complexes allowed for evaluation of which mtrB paralog(s)
can facilitate PEC/OMC interactions. Since only MtrB and MtrE
could complement ΔmtrB (Figure 2), only these two β-barrel pro-
teins were analyzed. To test the involvement of MtrB and MtrE in
facilitating electron exchange between PECs and OMCs mtrB and

mtrE were deleted from the recA
ΔMtr/mtrB and ΔMtr/mtrE, respectively. Once constructed, recA

reducing iron(III) citrate and occurrence in other sequenced She-
wanella strains (Fredrickson et al., 2008) suggests these paralogs
have divergent, but slightly overlapping function. The overlapping
functionality may be an artifact of sharing common ancestry or
a biochemical constraint on the system from either the source

of electrons (the menaquinone pool and CymA) or the destina-
tion of the electrons (e.g., an external respiratory substrate) or
both. With the exception of mtrD up-regulation during oxygen-
dependent autoaggregation when exposed to high calcium con-
centrations (McLean et al., 2008), the conditions under which

distinct functions. Moreover, the fact that SO4360 always clusters
with dmsAB homologs and mtrD with mtrBC homologs implies
that SO4359-62 may share overlapping functionality with DMSO
reductases and mtrDEF with metal reductases. E. coli’s DmsAB
have shown in vitro reduction activity with N-oxides, sulfoxides,
hydroxylamine, and chlorate, making these likely substrates for the
SO4359-62 module (Bilous et al., 1988).

One unexplained phenomenon is the existence of several parol-
ogous pathways that use CymA as the link to CM quinone pools.
In fact, all known substrates respired by MR-1, with the excep-
tion of oxygen, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), thiosulfate,
sulﬁte, and sulfur require the use of CymA and menaquinone
as electron mediators (Myers and Myers, 1997; Schwalb et al.,
2003; Shirodkar et al., 2011). In the genome of MR-1, TMAO,
sulﬁte, and elemental sulfur reductases all exist in operons with
putative quinone-oxidoreductases, explaining why CymA and in
some cases menaquinones are not required for the reduction of
these substrates (Kwan and Barrett, 1983; Wissenbach et al., 1992;
Gon et al., 2002; Shirodkar et al., 2011). Many of the anaero-
bic CymA-utilizing pathways present in MR-1 have homologs in
other organisms such as E. coli. For instance, DmsAB, FrdAB,
NrfABC, and NapAB all exist in other organisms and utilize their
own quinone-oxidoreductases: DmsC, FrdDC, NrfD, and NapC
respectively (Berks et al., 1995; Potter et al., 2001). MR-1 has
evolved to integrate the use of these terminal reductases with
a single quinone-oxidoreductase, CymA. By using CymA as an
electron bottleneck, MR-1 has introduced the ability to regulate
multiple anaerobic respiratory pathways with the regulation of
a single protein. There is evidence that many anaerobic respira-
tory pathways are turned on in the absence of oxygen, regardless
of electron acceptor availability (Beliaev et al., 2002). The ben-
eﬁt Shewanella would experience by turning on several respira-
tory pathways at once is rapid elimination of electrons from the
interior of the cell for redox carrier regeneration to allow energy-
generating substrate-level phosphorylation to proceed regardless
of which electron acceptor is available (Hunt et al., 2010). Many
Shewanella species have been isolated at aerobic/anaerobic inter-
faces in aquatic systems (Nealson and Saffarini, 1994), where they
must frequently switch between aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
To regulate respiratory pathways individually may prove ener-
getically inefﬁcient, especially if different acceptors are present
simultaneously. Therefore, it may be more favorable for MR-1
to up-regulate several anaerobic respiratory pathways at once,
especially when oxygen availability may ﬂuctuate often.

One interesting observation made in this study is that neither
DmsF nor SO4359 were able to facilitate interactions between
PECs and OMCs for the purpose of iron(III) citrate reduction.
Both dmsF and SO4359 are located in gene clusters containing
predicted homologs to the DMSO reductase subunits dmsAB.
The putative β-barrel integral OM proteins DmsF and SO4359
each likely interact with PEC proteins encoded in their respective
gene clusters. The β-barrel paralogs are similar in predicted size
(MtrB – 697aa, MtrE – 712aa, DmsF – 662aa, SO4359 – 656aa),
and therefore could have a similar number of transmembrane
domains. Consistent with our functional studies, MtrB and MtrF
are closer in size when compared to DmsF and SO4359. How-
ever, instead of a multiheme c-type cytochrome as the terminal

teins encoded by these genes remains unknown. The conservation
of mtrDEF and SO4359-62 in sequenced Shewanella that have
copies of mtrABC and dmsABEF implies that these genes have

reductase, there are two terminal reductase subunits: DmsB, which
contains a 4Fe–4S cluster and DmsA, which contains a molyb-
dopterin cofactor (Weiner et al., 1992). These DmsAB complexes
may interface with the MtrB paralogs DmsF and SO4359 dif-
ferently than with an OMC. Hence, it is more likely that DmsF
and SO4359 would be able to functionally replace each other,
since the terminal branch of their respiratory chains are also
paralogs.

In this study we have identiﬁed nine different MtrA/MtrB/MtrC
paralog modules of the Mtr respiratory pathway that could be
used to move electrons from the CM (CymA) to the outside of the
cell (OMC). One could imagine a heterologous expression system
where proteins with different redox potentials could be integrated

with core Mtr-pathway components. However, though many path-
ways exist to trafﬁc electrons to the cell surface, the purpose of two
of the pathways remain unknown. Their presence in the MR-1
and other Shewanella genomes is consistent with their function-
ality/utility for these bacteria in the environment. Understanding
the role of these pathways may help explain the global aquatic
presence of Shewanella and could lead to new biotechnological
applications of these diverse bacteria.
