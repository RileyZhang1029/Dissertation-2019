Here, we report the case of a 15-year-old male adolescent with lower extremity weakness, gait abnormalities, foot deformities and early-onset glaucoma.
Since clinical diagnosis alone was insufﬁcient for providing pathogenetic evidence to indicate that the condition belonged to a consanguineous family, we applied whole-exome sequencing to samples from the patient, his parents and his younger brother, assuming that the patient s condition is transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern.
A frame-shift mutation, c.4571delG (P.Gly1524Glufs*42), was revealed in the CMT4B2-related gene SBF2 (also known as MTMR13, MIM 607697), and this mutation was found to be homozygous in the proband and heterozygous in his parents and younger brother.
Together with the results of clinical diagnosis, this case was diagnosed as CMT4B2.
Our ﬁnding further demonstrates the use of whole-exome sequencing in the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases.

To date, there are only a few effective cures for genetic diseases.
For instance, some symptomatic therapies for speciﬁc diseases such as genetic-based cholestatic disorders, Wilson s disease and tyrosinemia can be cured by orthotopic liver transplantation [2].
Here, we report a case of a 15-year-old male adolescent who initially manifested weakness in both lower limbs at the age when he learned to walk, and then gradually developed obvious gait abnormalities, muscle atrophy, and talipes equinovarus, accompanied with early-onset glaucoma.
The parents of the proband are consanguineous, and he has a younger brother aged 2 with normal phenotype.
To further investigate this inherited disease, we performed whole-exome sequencing on the proband, his parents and younger brother, assuming that the condition was inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
Results  A 15-year-old male adolescent with unconﬁrmed Charcot Marie Tooth disease-like symptoms  The case in question relates to a 15-year-old male adolescent.
He was born after a full-term pregnancy and caesarian section due to fetal distress with normal Apgar score, followed by nor- mal growth and intelligence development.
His consanguineous parents and the 2-year-old younger brother exhibited normal phenotype.
However, he presented lower extremity weakness, gait abnormalities, foot deformities, and early-onset glaucoma, but no complaint of obvious paresthesia, numbness or pain.
Biochemical examination showed that metabolites in urinary and blood samples of the probands were within normal range.
In addition, his cranial MRI showed no abnormality and karyotype analyses also appeared normal.
We further per- formed electromyography (EMG) examination on motor and sensory nerves, and found that the current nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and EMG ﬁnding is consistent with a primary demyelinating motor and sensory polyneuropathy, with mod- erate-to-severe slowing of conduction velocities and absence of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs).
Besides, the clini- cal diagnosis mostly matches Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1).
However, mutation analysis of the main gene PMP22 of CMT1 was negative.
Therefore, the exact cause of the condition remains unclear.
CMT is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited motor and sensory peripheral neuropathies.
In gen- eral, this syndrome has an infantile or juvenile onset, with motor and sensory polyneuropathy semiology and pes cavus [3 6].
On the basis of mode of inheritance, clinical phenotypes,  electrophysiological and pathological features, CMT can be classiﬁed into the following types: CMT1, CMT2, CMT4, autosomal recessive (AR)-CMT2 and dominant intermediate (DI)-CMT (Table S1).
Each type can be further divided into several subtypes, depending on the underlying causative molecular defect.
Based on the aforementioned EMG results and primary complaints from the patient [7], we hypothesized that this proband suffered from CMT4B2 [8 10], although idi- opathic congenital talipes equinovarus [11] and other neuro- muscular disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy [12] cannot be excluded.
Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the four family members  About 265,000 exonic regions from the genomic DNA of the 4 family members were captured.
On an average, 12 Gb of sequencing data were generated from each individual, resulting in a mean depth of more than 110   per base per targeted region.
The coverage of the target region was over 99% (Table 1).
In total, we identiﬁed 107,122 single-nucleotide poly- morphisms (SNPs) from the exome of the proband (Table 2) by using SOAPsnp based on Bayes  theorem, by ﬁltering out low- quality mutations according to the criteria (reads   20, depths   4, estimated copy number   2 and the interval in between   5).
Numbers and distribution of SNPs and inser- tion-deletions (indels) of the four family members are listed in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.
Next, we ﬁltered the SNPs and indels according to the ﬁltering strategy as delineated in Figure 1.
Based on the initial screening criteria with variant location and frequency 6 0.005 in dbSNP, Hapmap and 1000 Genomes Database, and mutation type, we identiﬁed 3592 SNPs and indels.
The subsequent restrictive ﬁltering control further narrowed down the list and only 542 SNPs and indels were retained.
Identiﬁcation of a novel SBF2 mutation, c.4571delG, in CMT4B2  Based on the family history and clinical results (Figure 2A), we determined that the condition is transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern.
As a result, only homozygous variations identiﬁed in the patient were retained for further analysis, since heterozygous variations carried by the parents demonstrated normal phenotype.
We therefore obtained 32 SNPs and indels from 29 genes (Table S2).
Among them, only the gene SBF2 was found to be related to the phenotype.
SBF2 (also called MTMR13 or DENND7B, MIM 607697) is located on chromosome 11, base pairs 9,800,213 10,315,753.

SBF2 encodes SET binding factor 2, a novel inactive phosphatase of the myotu- bularin family [8,13], which is present in various tissues such as the cord and the peripheral nerve.
Mutations in SBF2 may cause CMT with early-onset glaucoma (CMT4B2) [7].
In humans, myotubularin-related proteins (MTMRs) consti- tute a large family with 14 members and have been suggested to work in phosphoinositide-mediated signaling events that may also convey the control of myelination [8].
Recessive mutations in SBF2 are typically found in patients with redun- dant myelin loops or myelin outfoldings in sural nerve biopsies [8].
Remarkably, our sequencing data revealed one novel mutation, c.4571delG, in exon 34 of the SBF2 gene, which was detected as homozygous in the proband and heterozygous in the other three family members.
This was also validated by the Sanger sequencing method (Figure 2B).
The c.4571delG (p.Gly1524Glufs*42) of SBF2 is a frameshift deletion muta- tion that causes a mutation in the myotubularin-like phospha- tase domain of the protein.
The deletion of a single guanine residue at codon 1524 within exon 34 produces a frameshift mutation, which generates a stop codon at codon 1566 (p.Gly1524Glufs*42) and results in a premature termination codon.
The parents carried this mutation in heterozygous form and were considered obligate carriers.
The proband harbored the c.4571_4571delG in the homozygous form, while his  younger brother with normal phenotype carried this mutation in its heterozygous form.
The same mutation is also inherited from one of their consanguineous parents.
The mutation was not present in the dbSNP and 1000 Genomes Database.
The catalytically-inactive SBF2 associates with MTMR2, which is an active lipid phosphatase also belonging to the MTMR family.
MTMR2 is found in the mutated form in CMT4B1 [9,10].
Previous studies revealed a possible scenario in which MTMR phosphatases play roles in regulating endosomal trafﬁcking of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and bisphosphate PI(3,5)P2 [11,12].
However, molecu- lar and cellular mechanisms addressing the correlation between the catalytic activity of MTMR phosphatases and their muta- tion in CMT4B remain to be elucidated.
Our study showed that the c.4571delG mutation generated a truncated SBF2 protein (Figure 2C), which may disrupt the soluble and membrane- associated protein complex formed by SBF2 and MTMR2, leading to defects in PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 regulation.
Because this mutation causes a premature termination, the production and function of the protein would be altered and such alteration was inherited from the consanguineous parents who carried the heterozygous deletion mutation but exhibited normal phenotype.
Therefore, we considered the homozygous deletion mutation to be   pathogenic  .
However, to verify this possibility, further experimental evidence would be required.

Discussion  Here we describe a novel mutation of the CMT-associated gene SBF2 in a Chinese patient.
CMT is a clinically and genet- ically heterogeneous group of inherited motor and sensory peripheral neuropathies, with a prevalence of 17 40 per 100,000 inhabitants [14,15].
In general, this syndrome has an infantile or juvenile onset, with motor and sensory polyneu- ropathy semiology and pes cavus [3 6].
Mendelian segregation in families may follow either autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked patterns.
Many previous studies have shown that molecular genetics can be used in the typing of CMTs such as autosomal dominant and X-linked inheritance [16].
It is now used in case of rarer types of CMTs, such as CMT4 with autosomal recessive pattern, that are similar to CMT1 with dominant forms, but are usually more severe with an earlier onset age [17,18].
According to autosomal recessive inheritance and both axonal and demyelinating neuropathies,  CMT4 can be differentiated from other forms of CMT.
Nerve conduction velocities in these individuals are often below 40 m/s.
The affected individuals exhibit the typical CMT phenotype of distal muscle weakness and atrophy associated with sensory loss, and frequently, pes cavus foot deformity.
These individuals tend to present these symptoms at earlier ages and with more severe disease progression, although many CMT4 subtypes exist with extensive clinical overlap [13,19 21].
Up till now, 9 genes associated with CMT4 subtypes have been discovered: GDAP1 (CMT4A), MTMR2 (CMT4B1), SBF2 (CMT4B2), SH3TC2 (CMT4C), NDRG1 (CMT4D), EGR2 (CMT4E), PRX (CMT4F), FGD4 (CMT4H) and FIG4 (CMT4J) [22].
These subtypes can be differentiated through clinical features, ethnic background and neuropatho- logical features.
However, most of these subtypes can only be differentiated through genetic tests.
For instance, CMT4B1 is caused by mutations in the gene encoding MTMR2 on chro- mosome 11q22 [23 25], and mutations in the SBF2 gene have   Chen M et al / A Novel SBF2 Mutation in CMT Disease  225  physiatrist and orthopedic surgeon, such as special shoes for foot drop correction and walking assistance, surgery for severe pes cavus, exercise for recovery, and symptomatic treatments for pain, depression and other symptoms [4,27 29].

The c. 4571delG deletion causes amino acid change at codon 1524 (Gly1524Glu), leads to the frame shift onward and thus creates a stop codon at codon 1566 (p.Gly1524Glufs*42).
This premature termination may result in a truncated SBF2 protein product comprising 1565 amino acid residues or lack of expression due to the nonsense-mediated decay.

been identiﬁed in CMT4B2 on chromosome 11p15 [8,26].
At present, there are still no effective cures for CMT4  however, we can administer symptomatic treatments by the neurologist,  that  suggests  In this study, we detected 32 homozygous mutations in 29 genes in a patient with unconﬁrmed CMT disease-like symp- toms and the homozygous deletion mutation c.4571delG in CMT4B2-related gene SBF2 was considered pathogenic.
Our protein domain organization analysis the c.4571delG mutation introduces a premature stop codon, which, if homozygous, may result in the loss of gene expression due to the nonsense-mediated decay or production of a trun- cated SBF2 protein lacking pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.
The PH domain is present in more than 100 cellular signaling proteins, e.g., protein kinases and GTPases, and characteristi- cally binds to proteins such as phosphatidylinositol within bio- logical membranes [30].
It plays multiple roles in navigating proteins to different types of host membranes and recruiting them to appropriate subcellular compartments.
In addition, PH domains are believed to bind to the heterotrimeric Gbc protein complex: G protein, protein kinase C and small GTP- ases [31].
However, it appears that PH domains, despite shar- ing low-sequence homology and non-conserved protein function, have a conserved core structurally composed of seven b-strands and one C-terminal a-helix [32].
Here, our ﬁnding of the SBF2 c.4571delG mutant may introduce the possibility of disruption or dysfunction of SBF2-MTMR2 complex forma- tion, which may, in turn, alter PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 regulation due to the PH domain deletion.
Several studies also showed that SBF2 was identiﬁed as the disease-causing gene of CMT4B1 and CMT4B2 by molecular cloning [8,13,33].
Non- sense or splice-site mutations affecting the N-terminus part of the SBF2 protein have been identiﬁed in patients with CMT4B2 [13,34].
Irregular myelin structure (outfolding) is a characteristic sign of CMT4B2, and the mutations reported in this study may result in nonfunctional proteins.
In addition, studies found that mutations of SBF2 can lead to thrombocy- topenia [35], pancreatic adenocarcinoma [36] and hereditary neuropathies [8] as well.
NGS has signiﬁcantly facilitated genome analysis.
Whole- exome genome sequencing (WES) of all protein-coding DNA is well justiﬁed as an efﬁcient strategy to search for alleles underlying rare Mendelian disorders [19].
Protein-coding genes constitute only approximately 1% of the human genome, but harbor  85% genetic mutations that determine disease-related traits.
In contrast to the laborious approach of SNP homozy- gosity mapping, the exome sequencing approach is more time- saving, is independent from shared allelic heritage and can be done in the presence of allelic heterogeneity [37].
When WES was initially introduced, its utility was highly debated, with respect to high cost, incomplete coverage of exome and low sensitivity for structural variation.
However, WES will likely be employed much more commonly in the future because of the practical advantages of the technology [38].
In addition to being applied in the diagnosis of Mendelian disorders, WES can also be used in the analysis of complex diseases, such as Parkinson s disease, hypertension and autism, and will be helpful for individualized medical treatments [39].
In summary, we found a novel  frameshift mutation, in the SBF2 gene, which c.4571delG(P. Gly1524Glufs*42), likely leads to the CMT4B2 in the proband.
Furthermore, our study shows that whole-exome sequencing can provide fast   226  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 221 227  and accurate sequencing information for clinic diagnosis.
Therefore, when a genetic disorder is strongly suspected, even in the case when traditional clinical genetic testing has difﬁ- culty in making a deﬁnite diagnosis, the application of NGS should be considered.
This approach, together with continuing improvement of sequencing technology, allows medical genomics to be a routine diagnostic method for rare Mendelian disorders in the near future.

Whole-exome sequencing  Supplementary material  Whole-exome sequencing was carried out using the SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v3.0 (64 M).
Prior to sequencing, 3 lg of qualiﬁed genomic DNA from each sample was randomly fragmented to 200 300 bp in size on a Covaris Acoustic Sys- tem, followed by end-repair, A-tailing and pair-end index adap- ter ligation.
The adapter-ligated templates were puriﬁed using AgencourtAM Pure SPRI beads and ampliﬁed by 4 cycles of ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR): 2 min at 94  C  4 cycles of 10 s at 94  C, 30 s at 62  C and 30 s at 72  C  followed by 5 min extension at 72  C. LM-PCR products were hybridized to the SeqCap EZ Oligo pool for enrichment.
After the hybrid- ized fragments were bound to the streptavidin beads in 24 h, non-hybridized fragments were removed.
Next, captured LM- PCR products were ampliﬁed by PCR (2 min at 98  C  15 cycles of 10 s at 98  C, 30 s at 60  C and 30 s at 72  C  then 5 min at 72  C), and analyzed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and quantitative PCR to estimate the enrichment magnitude.
The captured library was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2000 Analyzers.
We conducted 90 cycles per read to generate paired-end reads and 8 bp of the index tag following standard sequencing protocols from the manufacturer.
