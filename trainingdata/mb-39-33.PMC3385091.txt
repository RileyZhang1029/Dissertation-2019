Wild  yeasts  on  the  surface  of  various  fruits  including  grapes  were  surveyed  to  obtain  yeast  strains  suitable  for  fermenting
a  novel  wine  with  higher  alcohol  content  and  supplemented  with  rice  starch.  We  considered  selected  characteristics,  such
as  tolerance  to  alcohol  and  osmotic  pressure,  capability  of  utilizing  maltose,  and  starch  hydrolysis.  Among  637  putative  yeast
isolates,  115  strains  exhibiting  better  growth  in  yeast-peptone-dextrose  broth  containing  30%  dextrose,  7%  alcohol,  or  2%
maltose  were  selected,  as  well  as  five  α-amylase  producers.  Nucleotide  sequence  analysis  of  the  26S  rDNA  gene  classified
the  strains  into  13  species  belonging  to  five  genera;  Pichia  anomala  was  the  most  prevalent  (41.7%),  followed  by  Wick-
erhamomyces  anomalus  (19.2%),  P.  guilliermondii  (15%),  Candida  spp.  (5.8%),  Kodamaea  ohmeri  (2.5%),  and  Metschnikowia
spp.  (2.5%).  All  of  the  α-amylase  producers  were  Aureobasidium  pullulans.  Only  one  isolate  (NK28)  was  identified  as  Sac-
charomyces  cerevisiae.  NK28  had  all  of  the  desired  properties  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,  except  α-amylase  production,
and  fermented  alcohol  better  than  commercial  wine  yeasts.

Wine  consumption  has  been  increasing  steadily  world-
wide not only due to its good health function but as a cul-
tural preference. In Korea, wine consumption has increased
20~30%/yr,  and  the  market  is  expected  to  expand  even
further.  However,  the  quality  of  wine  produced  in  Korea
is  not  competitive  with  foreign  wines.  Therefore,  the
Korean  wine  market  has  been  seized  by  imported  wines
from Europe, USA, Chile, and South Africa.

Wine  quality  is  determined  mostly  by  the  raw  materials,
such as grapes and yeast starter. Fermentation and matura-
tion techniques are also significant. The yeast species, fer-
mentation  conditions,  and  nutrient  profiles  modulate  the
production  of  volatile  and  non-volatile  compounds.  Con-
sequently,  a  wine’s  flavor,  appearance,  aroma,  and  texture
are  determined  by  these  factors  [1-3].  Developing  a  wine
grape  cultivar  takes  much  time  and  labor  and  is  highly
dependent  on  soil  and  weather.  These  challenges  pose  a
great  hurdle  for  improving  the  quality  of  wine  production
in  Korea.  Therefore,  additional  novel  types  of  wine  with
added  health  functions  are  needed  to  provide  a  competi-
tive  edge  to  domestic  wine  producers.  Indeed,  domestic
producers  have  incorporated  various  fruits  and  powdered
grain  into  grapes,  usually  Campbell  Early,  to  produce
higher alcohol content and a unique taste and flavor [4-6].
Natural  wine  fermentation  combines  the  activities  of
several  yeasts  species,  which  grow  sequentially  through-
out  the  fermentation  process.  The  process  is  initiated  by

various  species  of  Candida,  Debaryomyces,  Hanseniaspora,
Pichia,  Kloeckera,  Metschnikowia,  Schizosaccharomyces,
Torulospora, and Zygosaccharomyces, which naturally exist
on  the  grape  surface.  Yeast  growth  is  generally  limited  to
the  first  2  or  3  days  of  fermentation  due  to  osmotic  pres-
sure  caused  by  the  glucose  added.  Subsequently,  the  most
strongly  fermenting  and  more  ethanol  tolerant  species  of
Saccharomyces  dominates  the  fermentation  [7].  However,
modern  winemaking  is  founded  on  the  use  of  selected
commercial  S.  cerevisiae  strains  for  their  reliable  proper-
ties, which contribute to the quality of the resulting product.
Developing  wine  fortified  with  unique  and  beneficial
compounds and higher alcohol content has been attempted
by  our  research  group  by  adding  Kanghwa-do  rice  and
kudzu  powders  to  wine  must  prepared  using  Campbell
Early grapes from Daebu-do. Starch hydrolysis with amy-
lolytic  enzyme(s)  provides  the  yeast  with  maltodextrins,
maltose, and glucose to ferment at a slightly buffered rate,
protects  the  starter  microorganism  from  osmotic  shock
[8],  and  allows  for  a  more  prolonged  fermentation  and
higher  alcohol  content.  Maltodextrins  of  various  lengths  also
help smooth the taste of wine. Kudzu has been reported to
contain  various  functional  compounds  such  as  antioxi-
dants and pueraline [9].

Wild  yeast  strains  were  screened  from  various  grapes
and fruits purchased in Korea. A diversity of yeast strains
with tolerance  to  high  alcohol  and osmotic  pressure  caused
by  high  sugar  concentrations  was  isolated  along  with  those
that  could  hydrolyze  starch  or  utilize  maltose  more  effi-

ciently  than  commercial  yeast  strains.  After  collecting  wild
yeast  strains,  we  selected  a  novel  wine  yeast  strain  along
with  many  others  for  other  types  of  alcohol  fermentation.
The  yeast  collection  would  contribute  to  preserving  the
genetic  resources  to  develop  yeast  strains  with  improved
functional traits.

Materials  and  Methods

Collecting  samples  to  isolate  the  wild  yeast  strains.
Grape  varieties,  including  Campbell  Early  (from  Dae-
budo,  Wanju,  and  Sangju),  Gerbong  (Cheonan),  Dela-
ware  (USA),  Thompson  Seedless  (Chile),  Muscat  Bailey
A  (Yeongdong,  Chile),  and  Neo  Muscat  (Haman)  were
purchased  from  markets  and  farms  around  Incheon  and
Seoul,  Korea.  Apples,  melons,  apricots,  wild  strawberry
(Bokbunja)  produced  in  Korea,  and  kiwi  from  New
Zealand were also purchased in the same area.

Isolation  of  yeast  strains  from  the  samples. Collected
samples  were  diced  and  placed  in  9 mL  of  yeast-peptone-
dextrose  (YPD)  broth  (1%  yeast  extract,  2%  peptone,  2%
dextrose,  pH  4.5)  to  make  a  total  volume  of  10 mL,  which
was  vortexed  vigorously  for  several  minutes.  An  aliquot
(1.5 mL)  was  centrifuged  for  1 min  at  12,000 rpm  in  a
microcentrifuge  (Hanil  Co.,  Seoul,  Korea).  The  precipitate
was  resuspended  in  200 µL  of  lysozyme  solution  (10 mg/
mL)  and  maintained  at  room  temperature  for  5~10 min  to
lyse the  bacteria. Then, the supernatant (20 µL) was spread
on YPD agar plates containing 10% dextrose and chloram-
phenicol  (50 µg/mL)  to  inhibit  the  growth  of  filamentous
fungi  and  bacteria,  respectively.  The  plates  were  incubated
for  2  days  at  30oC,  and  colonies  with  yeast-like  morphology
were  streaked  onto  fresh  YPD  agar  plates.  Microscopic
observation  of  the  colonies  was  made  using  a  phase  con-
trast microscope (DE/Axioplan 2; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany)  at  ×400  magnification  to  determine  their  mor-
phology and purity.

Screening  of  yeast  isolates. Wild  yeast  strains  were
selected  for  their  tolerance  to  a  high  concentration  of  glu-
cose  using  YPD  agar  plates  containing  40%  dextrose.
Strains forming large colonies on plates incubated at 30oC
for  48 hr  were  selected  and  tested  further  by  culturing  in
YPD broth containing 30, 40, or 50% dextrose at 30oC for
24 hr  with  agitation  (200 rpm)  and  compared  at  OD600
using  a  spectrophotometer  (Ultrospec  2000;  Pharmacia
Biotech,  Upsala,  Sweden).  The  strains  were  also  exam-
ined  for  their  tolerance  to  high  alcohol  content  by  cultur-
ing  them  on  YPD  agar  plates  containing  15  or  30%
alcohol. Those strains that could grow on the alcohol plates
were  screened  further  by  culturing  them  in  YPD  broth
containing  5~15%  alcohol  under  the  conditions  described
above  and  then  comparing  the  growth  at  OD600.  The  abil-

ity  of  the  isolates  to  utilize  maltose  was  screened  using
YP  agar  or  broth  containing  2%  maltose  (YPM).  Strains
forming  larger  colonies  on  YPM  plates  incubated  at  30oC
for  48 hr  were  selected  and  tested  further  by  culturing
them  in  YPM  broth  at  30oC  for  24 hr  with  agitation  and
comparing  the  growth  at  OD600.  Yeast  isolates  producing
α-amylase  were  screened  on  YP  agar  plates  supplemented
with 1% soluble starch (YPS) and by staining with iodine
solution (1% KI, 0.1% KI2). Two commercial strains of S.
cerevisiae,  Lv001  (Denmark)  and  La  Parisienne  (The
Netherlands), were used as controls.

Alcohol  assay. Yeast  strains  were  cultured  in  YPD  broth
containing  10%  dextrose  at  30oC  for  72~96 hr  without
agitation and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min to remove
the  cells.  The  supernatant  was  filtered  using  a  0.2 µm
syringe  filter  (Sartorius  Stedim  Biotech,  Goettingen,  Ger-
many)  and  subjected  to  high  performance  liquid  chroma-
tography  (Waters  600S;  Meadows  Instrumentation  Inc.,
Bristol,  WI,  USA),  using  a  Rezex  ROA-Organic  Acid  H+
column  (Phenomenex,  Torrance,  CA,  USA)  and  water  as
the solvent.

Identification  of  yeast  isolates. Selected  yeast  isolates
were  identified  by  analyzing  their  26S  rDNA  nucleotide
sequences [10]. Yeast isolates were cultured in YPD broth
at  30oC  for  48 hr  and  harvested  by  centrifugation.  The
genomic DNA was extracted using a Genomic DNA Puri-
fication  kit  (Promega,  Madison,  WI,  USA),  according  to
the manufacturer’s instructions, and a 560 bp DNA fragment
of  the  26S  rDNA  gene  was  amplified  by  the  PCR  using
primer-NL1  (5'-GCATATCAATAAGCGGAGGAAAAG-
3')  and  NL4  (5'-GGTCCGTGTTTCAAGACGG-3')  as
follows:  initial  denaturation  at  94oC  for  3 min  and  36
cycles  of  denaturation  at  94oC  for  1 min,  annealing  at
58oC for 1 min, extension at 72oC for 1.5 min, with a final
extension  at  72oC  for  5 min.  Nucleotide  sequences  of  the
resulting  PCR  products  were  determined  (Solgent  Co.,
Daejeon,  Korea)  using  NL1  and  NL4  as  the  primers,  and
homologous sequences were searched for in the sequences
of  the  National  Center  for  Biotechnology  Information
(NCBI) database using BLAST.

API  20C  AUX  kit  analysis. The  fermentation  proper-
ties of the wild yeast isolates were characterized using the
API  20C  kit  (Biomerieux,  Marcy  l’Etoile,  France).  Yeast
strains  were  cultured  on  YPD  agar  plates,  and  the  colo-
nies  were  resuspended  in  0.85%  NaCl  solution  to  a  final
turbidity  equal  to  2  McFarland  units.  The  yeast  suspen-
sion  (100 µL)  was  transferred  to  an  ampoule  of  API  C
medium and homogenized gently with a pipette. The strip
cupules were filled with the suspension in the ampoule of
API C medium and incubated at 30oC for 72 hr. A cupule
that  was  more  turbid  than  the  control  indicated  a  positive

reaction,  and  the  results  were  interpreted  using  the  data-
base  (V4.0)  and  the  ApiwebTM  software  provided  by  the
manufacturer.

Results  and  Discussion

Isolation  of  wild  yeasts  with  tolerance  to  osmotic  pres-
sure  and  alcohol. During  wine  fermentation,  yeast  cells
are  subjected  to  number  of  stressors,  the  most  important
being  osmotic  and  ethanol  stress  [11].  Therefore,  yeast
strains  tolerant  to  high  alcohol  or  glucose  concentrations
were  screened  first  in  this  study.  From  the  samples  col-
lected,  637  putative  yeast  strains  were  isolated  based  on
their  colony  morphology  and  microscopic  observations.
Among  them,  70  isolates  that  grew  on  YPD  agar  plates
containing  40%  dextrose  were  selected.  The  capability  of
the  isolates  to  grow  on  medium  with  high  sugar  concen-
trations  by  tolerating  high  osmotic  pressure  was  exam-
ined  further  by  culturing  them  in  YP  broth  containing  30,
40, or 50% at 30oC for 24 hr and comparing the results at
OD600. Eighteen isolates showed better growth in YP broth
containing  30%  dextrose,  which  is  closer  to  the  glucose
concentration  (24o  Brix)  for  wine  fermentation,  than  the
commercial  strain  (S.  cerevisiae  Lv001),  which  is  widely
used  for  wine  fermentation  (Fig.  1).  The  commercial  strain
grew  better  than  isolates  in  YP  broth  containing  40%  or
more  dextrose.  Those  isolates  that  achieved  better  growth
in YP broth with 30% dextrose than the commercial yeast

(RG6,  RG10,  RG11,  RG13,  RG18,  RG32,  RG33,  RG35,
RG42,  RG45,  RG46,  RG55,  RG56,  RG59,  RG61,  RG69,
RG71,  RG73,  and  NK28)  were  all  isolated  from  Camp-
bell  Early  grapes  except  NK28,  which  was  isolated  from
kiwi.  Isolates  with  tolerance  to  high  osmotic  pressure  were
identified  as  various  strains  of  Wickerhamomyces  anoma-
lus and Pichia anomala, and a S. cerevisiae strain.

The yeast isolates were examined for their resistance to
alcohol  on  YPD  agar  plates  containing  15  or  30%  alco-
hol in an attempt to isolate strains that could tolerate high
alcohol  concentrations.  Generally,  light  wines,  such  as  red,
white,  and  sparkling  wines,  contain  less  alcohol  (10~
14%),  whereas  alcohol  and  dessert  wines  (sweet  wines
usually  served  with  desserts)  contain  14~20%  alcohol.
None  of  the  isolates  or  the  commercial  strain  grew  on
YPD  agar  plates  containing  30%  alcohol.  Twenty-four
isolates  were  selected  based  on  their  ability  to  form  colo-
nies  on  YPD  agar  plates  containing  15%  and  were  tested
further for their alcohol tolerance in YPD broth with vari-
ous  alcohol  percentages  increased  at  1%  increments  from
5  to  15%  (Fig.  2).  Generally,  the  isolates  did  not  grow
well in  YPD broth containing more  than 7%  alcohol. Iso-
lates with higher alcohol tolerance were selected based on
their  capability to grow relatively well in YPD broth con-
taining  7%  alcohol.  They  were  RG1,  RG5,  RG11,  RG19,
RG21,  RG24,  RG28,  RG29,  RG30,  RG32,  RG33,  RG34,
RG35,  RG37,  RG40,  RG43,  RG44,  RG67,  RG68,  KG56
from  red  grapes;  and  NK28  from  kiwi.  Particularly,

culturing  the  isolates  in  yeast-peptone  broth  containing  30,  40,  or  50%  dextrose  at  30oC  for  24 hr,  and  the  growth  was
compared  at  OD600.  Results  of  only  one  group  of  isolates  are  presented.  All  experiments  were  conducted  in  duplicate,  and
the  averages  of  two  readings  are  presented.

Fig. 2. Tolerance  of  wild  yeast  isolates  to  high  alcohol  concentrations.  Tolerance  of  the  yeast  isolates  to  alcohol  was  examined  by
culturing  the  isolates  in  yeast-peptone-dextrose  broth  (YPD  broth)  containing  6~10%  alcohol  at  30oC  for  24 hr,  and  the
growth  was  compared  at  OD600.  All  experiments  were  conducted  in  duplicate,  and  the  averages  of  two  readings  are
presented.  Results  of  only  one  group  of  isolates  are  presented.

KG56,  which  was  identified  as  P.  anomala,  grew  much
better  than  the  commercial  strain  (S.  cerevisiae  Lv001)  in
YPD  broth  containing  15%  alcohol  (OD600 = 1.35).  These
alcohol  tolerant  yeast  strains  were  identified  as  various
strains  of  W.  anomalus,  Candida  spp.,  and  P.  anomala.
Isolation  of  alcohol  and/or  sugar  tolerant  S.  cerevisiae
strains  has  been  reported  from  nuruk,  cashew  apple,  and
soil  [12-14].  These  strains  were  capable  of  growing  in  a

medium containing 25~50% glucose or 15% alcohol.

Selection  of  wild  yeasts  with  efficient  maltose  utiliza-
tion. Wine  yeasts  are  usually  killed  during  fermentation
due  to  drastic  increases  in  alcohol  content  by  rapid  glu-
cose  catabolism  in  wine  must.  Therefore,  supplementing
wine  with  maltose  rather  than  glucose  might  relieve  this
problem  by  retarding  yeast  growth  and  alcohol  formation,

in  yeast-peptone  broth  containing  2%  dextrose  at  30oC  for  24 hr,  and  the  growth  was  compared  at  OD600.  All  experiments
were  conducted  in  duplicate,  and  the  averages  of  two  readings  are  presented.  Results  of  only  one  group  of  isolates  are
presented.

thereby  prolonging  the  length  of  fermentation.  For  this
purpose,  yeast  isolates  that  could  utilize  maltose  efficiently
were selected by culturing them on YPM agar plates con-
taining  2%  maltose.  A  total  of  123  isolates,  which  formed
larger  colonies  on  YPM  agar  plates,  were  tested  further
using  YPM  broth  and  by  comparing  growth  (Fig.  3).
Among  them,  14  isolates  from  Neo  Muscat  (GG2,  GG3,
GG7, GG9, GG11, GG14, GG16~18, GG21, GG22, GG28,
GG30, and GG36), 27 isolates from Campbell Early (RG5,
RG10,  RG11,  RG15,  RG16,  RG18,  RG20,  RG22,  RG24,
RG26,  RG27,  RG31,  RG34~37,  RG46~48,  RG50,  RG54,
RG57,  RG62,  RG67,  RG74,  and  RG75),  one  from  wild
strawberry  (WSS76),  and  one  from  kiwi  (NK28)  utilized
maltose  and  grew  better  than  the  others  including  the
commercial  yeast  strain  (S.  cerevisiae  Lv001).  The  isolates
were  identified  as  various  strains  of  W.  anomalus,  Can-
dida  sp.,  P.  anomala,  Metschinikowia.  aff.  fructicola,  and
a  S.  cerevisiae  strain.  Maltose  utilization  in  yeasts  is  con-
trolled  by  catabolite  repression  in  the  presence  of  glucose
and is carried out by inducible maltose permease and mal-
tase (α-glucosidase) [15]. However, the diversity of yeasts
catalyzing maltose efficiently has not been investigated.

Isolation  of  yeast  strains  producing  amylase. Rice
starch  is  added to wine  to round-out  the  taste. Rice  starch
in wine must should be hydrolyzed first into smaller mol-
ecules  by  adding  amylolytic  enzyme(s)  and  then  alcohol
fermentation  is  performed  by  the  yeast,  creating  a  two-
step  fermentation  process.  Oligosaccharides  and  glycerol
produced from carbohydrate in the wine provide the body
and  roundness  to  the  wine.  Yeast  strains  capable  of  pro-
ducing  amylolytic  enzymes  have  been  screened  or  devel-
oped by various research groups in an attempt to improve
process  time  and  cost  [16-18].  Some  of  the  strains  were
identified  as  S.  diastaticus,  Saccharomycopsis  fibuligera,
and  Sporobolomyces  holsaticus.  All  isolates  obtained  in
this  study  were  subjected  to  an  amylase  test  using  the

YPS  agar  plate  assay,  but  the  frequency  of  amylase-posi-
tive  yeast  was  very  low,  and  only  five  strains  were  posi-
tive (Fig. 4). α-Amylase activity was detected clearly after
3  days  of  cultivation.  The  strains  were  isolated  from
peach  and  Rubus  coreanus  Miquel  (bokbunja),  and  all
were identified as strains of Aureobasidium pullulans.

Diversity  of  the  selected  isolates. Among  637  isolates
of wild yeasts, 120 strains with at least one of the desired
properties, i.e.,  better  glucose  and  alcohol  tolerance,  supe-
rior  capability  to  utilize  maltose,  or  α-amylase  produc-
tion,  were  selected  and  identified  by  analyzing  the  partial
26S rRNA gene nucleotide  sequence. As  a  result,  the  iso-
lates  were  classified  into  13  species  in  seven  genera.
Twenty-three  strains  were  identified  as  W.  anomalus,  50
strains as P. anomala, seven strains as Candida spp., three
strains  as  Kodamaea  ohmeri,  18  strains  as  P.  guilliermon-
dii,  and  three  strains  as  Metschnikowia  spp.  (Fig.  5).  The
sequences  of  the  10  isolates  did  not  match  any  of  the
sequences  in  the  NCBI  database.  Recently,  P.  anomala,
which  belongs  to  the  non-Saccharomyces  wine  yeasts
[19],  has  been  renamed  W.  anomalus  [20],  making  it  the
most  prevalent  yeast  (60.8%)  with  desired  properties  in
fruits.  P.  anomala  is  one  of  the  selected  non-Saccharomy-
ces wine yeasts and is used for cofermentation to enhance
wine  aroma  [21].  W.  anomalus  has  low  virulence  and  is
present  in  a  variety  of  niches  with  a  wide  geographical
distribution  due  to  its  capability  to  flourish  in  harsh  envi-
ronments  [22].  Only  one  strain,  NK28,  was  identified  as
S.  cerevisiae  with  100%  identity  for  the  565 bp  26S  rDNA
fragment amplified by PCR and sequenced. All five strains
producing  α-amylase  were  identified  as  A.  pullulans,
which is known to produce pullulan.

Two  of  the  isolates  identified  as  W.  anomalus  TY16
(RG5,  RG32),  one  as  P.  anomala  GS80A  (RG67),  and
one  as  S.  cerevisiae  (NK28),  exhibited  the  three  desirable
properties regarding glucose and alcohol tolerance as well

as an ability to efficiently utilize maltose. Generally, the abil-
ity  to  efficiently  use  maltose  was  strongly  correlated  with
tolerance  to  osmotic  pressure but  not to  alcohol tolerance.
The  results  indicated  a  diversity  in  the  yeasts  with  toler-
ance to high glucose and alcohol; those with efficient mal-
tose utilization or those with  α-amylase were very limited
on  fruits.  Based  on  the  results,  only  one  S.  cerevisiae
(NK28)  strain  was  obtained  and  its  characteristics  were
analyzed  further  to  examine  its  utilization  as  a  selected
wine yeast.

Kloeckera apiculata is the most frequently isolated native
species from undamaged grapes and may account for over
50%  of  the  total  yeast  flora  from  fruits  [23].  Candida,
Cryptococcus,  Debaryomyces,  Hansenula,  Issatchenkia,
Kluyveromyces,  Metschnikowia,  Pichia,  and  Rhodotorula
have  also  been  reported  in  lesser  numbers.  The  popula-
tions  of  Saccharomyces  are  often  less  than  50  colony
forming  unit/mL  on  grape  musts.  Therefore,  the  diversity
of  yeasts  surveyed  in  this  study  represents  mostly  those
with  selective  characteristics  of  glucose  and  alcohol  toler-
ance, efficient maltose utilization, and starch hydrolysis.

Properties  of  the  novel  S.  cerevisiae  isolate. The  only
S.  cerevisiae  strain  obtained  from  kiwi,  NK28,  was  com-
pared  with  other  commercial  S.  cerevisiae  strains,  Lv001
and  Parisienne,  for  tolerance  to  sugar  and  maltose  utiliza-
tion.  Lv001  is  a  commercial  yeast  strain  that  has  been
most  widely  used  for  wine  fermentation.  La  Parisienne
was developed as a commercial baker’s yeast but recently
began  to  be  used  for  wine  fermentation,  as  wine  fer-
mented  by  La  Parisienne  has  lower  acidity  and  increased
roundness [24]. NK28 showed the strongest glucose toler-
ance  in  YPD  broth  containing  30%  dextrose  and  could
utilize  maltose  as  a  carbon  source  better  than  Lv001.
NK28  showed  a  weaker  tolerance  to  alcohol  than  Lv001
at  low  concentrations  (6~7%)  but  similar  or  better  at
higher  concentrations  (8%  or  above).  NK28  could  pro-
duce  14%  and  18%  more  alcohol  than  Lv001  and  La
Parisienne, respectively, in 72 hr of glucose fermentation.

From  the  results,  NK28  seemed  to  be  more  closely
related  to  La  Parisienne  than  to  Lv001.  The  characteris-
tics  of  these  S.  cerevisiae  strains  were  compared  using
API  20  C  AUX,  which  analyzes  the  capabilities  of  yeast
strains  utilizing  19  different  carbon  sources,  as  shown  in
Table  1.  NK28  was  different  from  Lv001  in  the  utiliza-
tion  of  two  carbon  sources.  NK28  could  not  utilize  glyc-
erol  but  Lv001  could;  NK28  could  utilize  methyl-α-D-
glucopyranoside,  but  Lv001  could  not.  NK28  showed
exactly  the  same  properties  as  those  of  La  Parisienne  for
all  carbon  sources  tested.  Previously,  La  Parisienne  was
reported to produce more alcohol than various wine yeasts
[24]. These two strains were different only in the floccula-
tion of cells during liquid culture. The NK28 cells did not
flocculate  with  each  other,  whereas  La  Prisienne  floccu-

lated  in  liquid  culture.  These  properties  of  NK28  would
make it suitable for the fermentation of a novel wine sup-
plemented  with  hydrolyzed  rice  starch.  The  variety  of  the
yeast  collection  established  in  this  study  could  provide
select  yeast  strains  for  various  types  of  alcohol  fermenta-
tion or genetic sources to improve conventional strains.
