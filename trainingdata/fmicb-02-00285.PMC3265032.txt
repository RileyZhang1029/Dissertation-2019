Since the days of Darwin, scientists have used the framework of the theory of evolution
to explore the interconnectedness of life on Earth and adaptation of organisms to the ever-
changing environment. The advent of molecular biology has advanced and accelerated the
study of evolution by allowing direct examination of the genetic material that ultimately
determines the phenotypes upon which selection acts. The study of evolution has been
furthered through examination of microbial evolution, with large population numbers, short
generation times, and easily extractable DNA. Such work has spawned the study of micro-
bial biogeography, with the realization that concepts developed in population genetics may
be applicable to microbial genomes (Martiny et al., 2006; Manhes and Velicer, 2011). Micro-
bial biogeography and adaptation has been examined in many different environments. Here
we argue that the deep biosphere is a unique environment for the study of evolution and
list speciﬁc factors that can be considered and where the studies may be performed. This
publication is the result of the NSF-funded Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations
(C-DEBI) theme team on Evolution (www.darkenergybiosphere.org).

WHAT IS THE DEEP BIOSPHERE?
The deep biosphere is often operationally deﬁned as described
in Teske and Sørensen (2008). For this paper, we consider the
marine deep biosphere, starting on average at 1 mbsf (meters
below seaﬂoor). Sediments above 10 cm have an average cell
density of 109 cells/ml, versus sediments below 10 m averaging
107 cells/ml (Whitman et al., 1998). Studies suggest that despite
the low apparent biomass in this environment, the large total
volume of the deep biosphere could allow it to harbor the major-
ity of biomass on the planet (Gold, 1992; Whitman et al., 1998).
Using this deﬁnition of deep biosphere, we also include all poten-
tial reserviors in the igneous crust. Recent projects have begun to
delineate the abundance and diversity of organisms present in the
subseaﬂoor biosphere and their global geochemical importance
(D’Hondt et al., 2004, 2009). Genetic studies tracking the loca-
tions of microorganisms (Inagaki et al., 2006) and observations
of their genomes (Biddle et al., 2008, 2011) have shown that sub-
surface habitats, even those with low biomass, are tractable for
genomic studies.

WHAT MAKES THE DEEP BIOSPHERE A UNIQUE PLACE TO
STUDY EVOLUTION?
It is our opinion that the deep biosphere offers a unique oppor-
tunity to examine microbial evolution in action. Often, microbial
evolution is studied in an environment where numerous factors are
controlling the rate of diversiﬁcation and adaptation, in areas of
abundant resources, undetermined connectedness and unknown
species interactions. In contrast, the deep biosphere offers an envi-
ronment where many of the standard forces in ecology are either

not in play or much reduced. As examples, we will focus on disper-
sal, activity, metabolic ﬂexibility, and thermodynamic extremes.

DISPERSAL
The deep biosphere in the marine realm is an environment existing
in a physical matrix of sediments or igneous basalt. Unlike pelagic
environments, where transport is inﬂuenced by many factors
including temperature, currents, wind, and attachment to larger
surfaces, dispersal is constrained in the deep biosphere. The study
of subsurface hydrology in igneous crustal habitats has shown us
that ﬂuid exchange between crustal and oceanic reservoirs spans
the range between advection and diffusion, and may be quite
dynamic. In contrast, ﬂuid exchange in deep sedimentary biomes
is dictated almost entirely by diffusion. This range of constraints
on the exchange between reservoirs of microbial diversity can facil-
itate the study of the evolution of individual populations by specif-
ically addressing how adaptation in isolation inﬂuences evolution.
For example as seen in the study of Sulfolobus species in hot spring
environments in the continental realm (Whitaker et al., 2003). The
study of local adaptation as an evolutionary force has been wide-
spread throughout isolated populations (Kawecki and Ebert, 2004)
however, the extreme time scales over which populations in the
subsurface are isolated from the rest of the planet are likely to have
profound evolutionary consequences, perhaps the drastic slowing
or speeding of molecular clocks, that should be experimentally
testable, and provide a unique place to study local adaptation.

ACTIVITY
The deep biosphere, where it has been examined so far (i.e., prin-
cipally in sedimentary habitats) is generally considered to be a

nutrient poor environment, despite some “hot spots” of high
nutrients, such as those seen below active upwelling regions on
continental margins (D’Hondt et al., 2004). Consequently, subsur-
face microbes are considered to have low activity and extremely
long doubling times, potentially as long as 200–2,000 years (Biddle
et al., 2006). This decrease in activity may result in mostly isolated
cells, whose individual cellular responses may have more control
over metabolism than signals given through ecological interac-
tions among the community. Additionally, the role of viruses is
relatively unknown in the deep biosphere (see Anderson et al.,
2011, for a theoretical examination of their role and Engelhardt
et al., 2011 for empirical discussion). The deep biosphere is there-
fore a unique place to study the evolution of organisms living at
the lower limits of metabolic activity.

METABOLIC FLEXIBILITY/INVENTION
Due to nutrient limitation and interaction with geologic fea-
tures within the deep biosphere, novel metabolisms may exist
in its microbial inhabitants that are not seen elsewhere. Already

geochemical evidence points to the microbial production of ethane
and propane, although a deﬁned pathway has not been deter-
mined (Hinrichs et al., 2006). Many physiological processes may
behave in surprising ways under the pressure and temperature
extremes encountered in deep life, such as the formation of iso-
topically heavy methane (Takai et al., 2008). A comparison between
metagenomes from the marine water column and subsurface sed-
iments reveals that subsurface metagenomes exist in their own
genetic “space,” as seen by the subsurface sample’s separation
from the other samples, based on PCA plots of KEGG categories
(Figure 1; Biddle et al., 2006, 2011), indicating unique genomic
innovation may have evolved in this biome.

EXTREME HABITATS
The deep biosphere is one of the few places on Earth where a
similar physical environment, for example: sediment, is in contact
with multiple geochemical and geothermal regimes. For exam-
ple, sediments within one drilled hole can range in temperatures
from 2 to 50˚C (Parkes et al., 2000). Sediments cored during the

expedition to the Newfoundland Margin ranged from seaﬂoor
temperature of 4˚C up to 100˚C, where microbial signatures were
still detected (Roussel et al., 2008). The ability to analyze taxonom-
ically similar microbial populations across multiple temperatures,
as detected in this environment, is a unique opportunity, con-
sidering that in most environments with hydrothermal activity
(Yellowstone hot springs, hydrothermal vents) microbial com-
munities rapidly change across the heat gradient (Rothschild and
Mancinelli, 2001). Thermal gradients are often more gradual in the
subsurface biome, compared to vent environments, where extreme
gradients exist across a mere few centimeters. This allows for more
careful experimentation with the effects of thermal gradients on
evolution within microbial populations that may take place slowly
over millennia.

WHAT ARE WAYS TO STUDY EVOLUTION IN THE DEEP
BIOSPHERE?
Many major questions can affect the ability to study evolution in
the deep biosphere. Factors governing dispersal need to be con-
strained in order to assess the amount of gene ﬂow and isolation
that may occur in the subsurface. As suggested above, there may be
limited dispersal of microorganisms in this mostly solid environ-
ment, but areas of high ﬂuid exchange through subsurface basalt
where fast advective ﬂow may allow gene ﬂow among microbes
(e.g., Wheat and Fisher, 2008). The doubling times of subsurface
organisms is not well constrained, and may need to be examined
in detail in order to estimate a proper sampling distance for evo-
lutionary studies. Additionally, habitat size and quality will inﬂu-
ence local adaptation, so geochemical and geophysical parameters
should also be considered during sampling schemes (Kawecki and
Ebert, 2004). Due to the difﬁculty of sampling and detection in the
deep biosphere, coupled with the prediction that the majority of its
inhabitants are microbial, we anticipate the evolutionary studies
will predominantly be genome-based, observed by the genomes of
model organisms, metagenomic, and PCR-generated sequences.

USE OF MODEL ORGANISMS/GENOMES
Considering the challenges in the assessment of biogeography and
evolution of microbial populations, a focus on a particular group
of microorganisms may be warranted in order to detect evolu-
tionary events of local adaptation. Microbial groups such as the
Zetaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, Chloroﬂexi, and Mis-
cellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group (MCG; Figure 2) serve as a few
of the interesting candidates for the study of evolution due to the
following reasons:

ZETAPROTEOBACTERIA
The Zetaproteobacteria contain iron-oxidizing bacteria, or FeOB,
including the cultured isolate Mariprofundus ferrooxydans (Emer-
son et al., 2007). Recently the Zetaproteobacteria, now recognized
as ubiquitous microorganisms that often dominate speciﬁc deep-
sea habitats such as seamounts and borehole ﬂuid, were shown
to exhibit biogeographic separation based on habitat (McAllister
et al., 2011). Some groups of Zetaproteobacteria appear ubiquitous
throughout the Paciﬁc Ocean, while others show more endemism
toward their local habitats. Due to the widespread distribution and
unique biogeochemistry of the Zetaproteobacteria, this group is

an intriguing one to examine, particularly since analysis of the
Zetaproteobacterial sequences originating from borehole ﬂuids
of the Southern Mariana Trough suggests that there may be a
unique group of these organisms endemic to the deep subsurface
(McAllister et al., 2011). In addition, Zetaproteobacteria have been
detected (IODP Expedition 331) using enrichment culture and by
qPCR from distinct subsurface habitats (Moyer and McAllister,
2011). A genome sequence is available for M. ferrooxydans, allow-
ing for more intricate examination of FeOB endemism, beyond
the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (Singer et al., 2011).

EPSILONPROTEOBACTERIA
The Epsilonproteobacteria (Figure 2A) are abundant and ubiqui-
tous inhabitants of many hydrothermal vent environments includ-
ing chimneys, ﬂuids, sediments, and animal hosts (Campbell et al.,
2006). Most species are supported by hydrogen or sulfur oxida-
tion, but the group is extraordinarily diverse. One hydrothermal
chimney can harbor many different metabolic guilds of Epsilon-
proteobacteria in distinct ecological niches (Campbell et al., 2006),
and a single ﬂuid sample can contain thousands of Epsilonpro-
teobacterial 16S rRNA sequence clusters (Huber et al., 2007).
Furthermore, there are indications of biogeographic patterns in
the Epsilonproteobacterial populations within and among vent
ﬁelds (Huber et al., 2010). Because the ﬂuid samples collected
from the chimneys are exiting from the subsurface, these results
indicate local and global dispersal limitations in the subsurface
biosphere. The Epsilonproteobacteria are amenable to laboratory
cultivation (Takai et al., 2005; Campbell et al., 2006), making
them ideal representatives of the subsurface for experimental
research.

CHLOROFLEXI
Chloroﬂexi (Figure 2A) are highly abundant in deeply buried
marine sediments, but unlike their representatives in surface
environments, they have resisted classic cultivation techniques
(Figure 2A; Blazejak and Schippers, 2010). The phylum Chlo-
roﬂexi is frequently divided into at least six classes: Chloroﬂexi,
Thermomicrobia, Anaerolineae, Caldilineae, Dehalococcoidetes,
and subphylum IV (SAR202 cluster; Rappe and Giovannoni, 2003;
Hugenholtz and Stackebrandt, 2004; Morris et al., 2004). The
most common Chloroﬂexi sequences in marine margin sediments
fall within the classes Anaerolineae, Caldilineae, and Dehalococ-
coidetes (Parkes et al., 2005; Biddle et al., 2006; Inagaki et al.,
2006). Members of Dehalococcoidetes derive energy through the
reduction of organohalide compounds and the oxidation of H2
(Seshadri et al., 2005). The wide distribution of Dehalococcoidetes
sequences in deep anoxic sediments may indicate a common
niche for organisms that grow on organohalides that is globally
exploited, and the presence of reductive dehalogenase homolo-
gous (rdhA) genes globally distributed in subsurface sediments
(Futagami et al., 2009) supports this hypothesis. Members of the
Dehalococcoidetes have also shown a high potential for horizon-
tal gene transfer, moving ecologically relevant, content-variable
genomic islands between members of the same species (McMur-
die et al., 2011), further increasing their potential as a model group
of interest allowing for the study of horizontal gene transfer within
the deep marine sediment environment.

MCG ARCHAEA
The MCG was ﬁrst labeled in 2003 and since then the group’s
molecular signatures have been found in a wide array of subsur-
face habitats (Figure 2B; Inagaki et al., 2003). This archaeal group
remains uncultivated and its metabolism is currently unknown.
The group’s wide distribution in sediments indicates that it may be
a useful group to examine for the transition into a “deep” lifestyle,
since phylogenetically similar clones are seen in shallow estuaries
and deep ocean sediments (Biddle et al., 2006; Meng et al., 2009).
This group could also be used for biogeography studies in the deep
biosphere since it appears to have a global distribution in anoxic
sediments (Inagaki et al., 2003; Biddle et al., 2006).

WHERE TO STUDY EVOLUTION IN THE DEEP BIOSPHERE?
The ability to compare different physical conditions, geo-
graphically distinct settings, or settings that are geographi-
cally distinct but have similar physical conditions would ben-
eﬁt the study of deep biosphere evolution greatly. Proposals
for future drilling expeditions can be submitted and those that
are planned can be viewed through the IODP web resources
(www.iodp.org/expeditions). Here we make the case for the study
of evolution in model systems that have been suggested for future
exploration based on prior research:

AREAS OF SIMILAR GEOCHEMISTRY
Expeditions have often focused on areas of sediment that con-
tain high concentrations of methane, including methane hydrates,
to investigate the biological and physical formations of this gas.
Those cruises include: Cascadia Margin (IODP Expeditions 311,
328, and ODP Leg 146), Costa Rica (IODP expeditions 344, 334,
and ODP Legs 137, 140, 148), Peru Margin (ODP Legs 112, 201,
202), and other margin areas. The examination of similarly aged
sediments with similar geochemical regimes (for example, the sul-
fate/methane transition zone) would allow for the speciﬁc investi-
gation of how geographic separation may affect microorganisms
undergoing potential divergent evolutionary processes. If possible,
ﬁnding areas of similar sediment composition (typically seen on
margin sites), sediment age, and similar geochemistry (such as an
SMTZ), it may be possible to limit variables to interpret the effect
of geographic location. Similar surface studies have yielded inter-
esting results (Whitaker et al., 2003), suggesting that geographic
separation alone can yield evolutionary shifts in microbes when
populations are subjected to similar chemical forces. A potential
similar experiment focusing on subsurface rocks could ask similar
questions in a massive sulﬁde setting. This ubiquitous subseaﬂoor
substrate was drilled during ODP Legs 158 (Humphris et al., 1995)
and 169 (Zierenberg et al., 1998).

REACTIVATION AFTER STASIS
The idea that some microbial groups may be dormant in deep sed-
iments due to a lack of nutrient and energy ﬂuxes may play a role
in the evolution of subsurface microbes. A microbial response to
an increase in nutrients made available by geothermal activity was
examined on the Newfoundland Margin on ODP Leg 210 (Rous-
sel et al., 2008). This type of investigation is in its infancy, but
due to the success of the initial experiments, this type of system
could be investigated more thoroughly in the future. The evolu-
tion occurring in these “reactivated” microbes may parallel the

models of bursts in positive selection seen after stasis in inﬂuenza
A viral populations (Wolf et al., 2006). Additionally, it may provide
insight into microbial succession.

RIDGE FLANKS
The Juan de Fuca ridge ﬂank in the Paciﬁc Ocean has recently
become a site of intense scientiﬁc focus for understanding the deep
biosphere in igneous ocean crust. Pioneering work using observa-
tories has enabled scientists for the ﬁrst time to study microbial
populations in situ within the crust (see Edwards et al., 2012).
The ﬁrst long-term observatory study conducted at Juan de Fuca
revealed succession of microbial communities over time which
correlated with geochemical and mineralogical conditions within
the borehole (Orcutt et al., 2011). Current work at a contrast-
ing geochemical/geological setting in the Atlantic (North Pond,
IODP Expedition 336) will allow for important comparisons to
be made about ridge ﬂank microbial communities as a func-
tion of these conditions (Edwards et al., 2012). The porous and
permeable upper oceanic aquifer system at Juan de Fuca, North
Pond, and other ridge ﬂank settings allow for questions regarding
the interconnectedness and evolutionary forces that shape these
subseaﬂoor microbial communities.

FUTURE POTENTIAL SUBSURFACE EXPERIMENTS, ALL OF
WHICH REQUIRING THE USE OF DRILLING PLATFORMS,
WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY INVESTIGATED BY
DRILLING: LOST CITY
A major uncertainty in subsurface ecosystems is the availability
of energy and carbon to drive microbial activity. Hydration of
the ultramaﬁc rocks of the Atlantis Massif underlying the Lost
City hydrothermal ﬁeld (Kelley et al., 2005) results in a set of
geochemical reactions known as serpentinization, which is highly
exothermic and can release large quantities of hydrogen gas and
variable levels of methane and other low molecular weight organic
compounds. These chemicals support dense microbial communi-
ties in the carbonate chimneys of the Lost City hydrothermal ﬁeld,
but the extent and activity of organisms in the underlying sub-
surface awaits exploration and initial examination of unroofed
gabbros has begun (Mason et al., 2011). The apparent longevity
of serpentinization-associated processes (Fruh-Green et al., 2003)
indicates that the microbial denizens of the Atlantis Massif sub-
surface have had access to copious energy and organic carbon
for possibly millions of years. The nature of ﬂuid circulation
between the massif and adjacent regions of the seaﬂoor is cur-
rently unknown, but would have profound consequences on the
dispersal of microorganisms within the subsurface biosphere. It
is possible that some organisms could be reactivated during their
transit through the massif and then return to a dormant state after
they have been transported out of it. Clearly, this habitat provides
exciting opportunities for studying the evolution of potentially
isolated but energy-rich ecosystems and their inﬂuence on other
regions of the subsurface biosphere.

MARINE AND FRESHWATER HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS
One of the great surprises in subsurface microbiology is that some
of the dominant organisms detected in terrestrial subsurface habi-
tats, such as gold mines, are very similar to those detected in
the marine subsurface basement (Takai et al., 2001; Moser et al.,

www.frontiersin.org

Evolution in the deep biosphere

2005). With this in mind, much can be learned by studying similar
environments in terrestrial and marine settings, with the spe-
ciﬁc goal of determining degrees of connectedness between these
biomes and testing hypotheses about convergent evolution. Fresh-
water hydrothermal systems are common in rift lakes such as Lake
Baikal in Russia (Crane et al., 1991) and Lake Tanganyika in Africa
(Tiercelin et al., 1993), and these systems harbor microbial fauna
similar to those in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Similarly, fresh-
water alkaline springs harbor microbial communities that bear
resemblances to those in seaﬂoor alkaline springs (Brazelton et al.,
2011). Subsurface studies of a series of hydrothermal systems from
freshwater and marine systems are likely fertile areas for excit-
ing discoveries in biogeography and geographical isolation, and
may also have similarities to well studied thermal systems such
as Yellowstone National Park. Additionally, the study of several
systems for one project would require international cooperation
and many researchers, thereby fostering collaboration within the
international research community.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Although the deep subsurface biosphere is difﬁcult to access and
most often can be studied as only a snapshot of an environment,

many experiments to assess the unique forces acting on evo-
lution in this vast habitat are possible. Through the study of
speciﬁc groups of microorganisms that are common inhab-
itants of the subseaﬂoor, biogeography, and local adaptation
questions may be posed. Understanding of hydrogeology and
geophysical parameters are needed, making any evolutionary
questions posed in this environment inherently multidiscipli-
nary in nature, even if they are approached with a genomics-
oriented investigation. Past expeditions have allowed the gen-
eration of hypotheses or situational investigations and future
expeditions, including long-term CORK observatories, will allow
for further investigation into this unique biosphere on our
planet.
