Members of the phylum Planctomycetes are common inhabitants of northern wetlands.
We used barcoded pyrosequencing to survey bacterial diversity in an acidic (pH 4.0) Sphag-
num peat sampled from the peat bog Obukhovskoye, European North Russia. A total of
21189 bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained, of which 1081 reads (5.1%)
belonged to the Planctomycetes. Two-thirds of these sequences afﬁliated with plancto-
mycete groups for which characterized representatives have not yet been available. Here,
we describe two organisms from one of these previously uncultivated planctomycete
groups. One isolate, strain OB3, was obtained from the peat sample used in our mol-
ecular study, while another strain, SP2T (=DSM 23888T =VKM B-2710T), was isolated
from the peat bog Staroselsky moss. Both isolates are represented by aerobic, budding,
pink-pigmented, non-motile, spherical cells that are arranged in unusual, dendriform-like
structures during growth on solid media. These bacteria are moderately acidophilic and
mesophilic, capable of growth at pH 4.0–7.0 (optimum pH 5.0–5.5) and at 6–30˚C (opti-
mum 20–26˚C). The preferred growth substrates are various heteropolysaccharides and
sugars, the latter being utilized only if provided in low concentrations (≤0.025%). In con-
trast to other described planctomycetes, strains SP2T and OB3 possess weak cellulolytic
potential. The major fatty acids are C16:1ω5c, C18:1ω5c, C16:0, and C18:0. Characteristic
lipids are the n-C31 polyunsaturated alkene (9–10 double bonds) and C30:1/C32:1 (ω-1)
hydroxy fatty acids. The G+ C content of the DNA is 58.5–59.0 mol%. Strains SP2T and
OB3 share identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, which exhibit only 86 and 87% similarity
to those of Gemmata obscuriglobus and Zavarzinella formosa. Based on the characteristics
reported here, we propose to classify these novel planctomycetes as representatives of a
novel genus and species, Telmatocola sphagniphila gen. nov., sp. nov.

INTRODUCTION
The planctomycetes is a ubiquitously distributed and a largely
unexplored bacterial phylum, which contains only a limited num-
ber of taxonomically characterized representatives (Fuerst, 1995;
Ward et al., 2006; Fuerst and Sagulenko, 2011). At present, the
list of validly described planctomycetes includes the genera Planc-
tomyces (Gimesi, 1924), Pirellula (Schlesner and Hirsch, 1987),
Blastopirellula, Rhodopirellula (Schlesner et al., 2004), Isosphaera
(Giovannoni et al., 1987), Gemmata (Franzmann and Skerman,
1984), Schlesneria (Kulichevskaya et al., 2007b), Singulisphaera
(Kulichevskaya et al., 2008), Zavarzinella (Kulichevskaya et al.,
2009), and Aquisphaera (Bondoso et al., 2011). These 10 genera
accommodate 16 species, which differ in cell morphology, eco-
physiological adaptations, substrate preferences, and other phe-
notypic and genotypic characteristics. However, all members of
these species display a number of common features including a
budding mode of cell division, peptidoglycan-less cell walls, and
a unique cell organization (Staley et al., 1992; Fuerst, 1995, 2005;
Ward et al., 2006). All taxonomically characterized planctomycetes

are chemoheterotrophs; many of them are capable of degrading
various heteropolysaccharides but not cellulose or chitin.

Highly distinctive cell morphology is typical for many plancto-
mycetes. Rosettes of spherical cells joined together by non-cellular
stalks represent one of the most fascinating planctomycete mor-
photypes, which is characteristic of Planctomyces bekeﬁi. This
species has never been isolated in pure culture and was described
based solely on its speciﬁc morphology (Gimesi, 1924). The same
is true for two other species of the genus Planctomyces, P. guttae-
formis, and P. stranskae (Starr and Schmidt, 1984). Traditionally,
these rosette-forming stalked morphotypes that are commonly
observed in various aquatic environments have been classiﬁed
as belonging to the genus Planctomyces. Recently, however, we
reported that the presence of a stalk and a similar rosette-like cell
arrangement is typical for the novel Gemmata-like planctomycete,
Zavarzinella formosa (Kulichevskaya et al., 2009). The latter bac-
terium was isolated from acidic Sphagnum peat, which is densely
colonized by members of the Planctomycetes (Dedysh et al., 2006;
Kulichevskaya et al., 2006; Ivanova and Dedysh, 2012).

Our further cultivation efforts resulted in the isolation of
two other peat-inhabiting, morphologically unique, Gemmata-
like planctomycetes, strains SP2T and OB3, from two North Euro-
pean Sphagnum peat bogs Staroselsky moss and Obukhovskoye.
When grown on solid media, spherical cells of these bacteria were
arranged in unusual, dendriform-like structures. The peat sample
used for isolating strain OB3 was also used for pyrosequencing-
based Bacteria diversity analysis. This analysis indicated that
microorganisms related to strains SP2T and OB3 made a signif-
icant proportion of peat-inhabiting planctomycetes. In order to
characterize phenotypic properties of the newly isolated plancto-
mycetes and to understand their functional role in Sphagnum peat,
this work was initiated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLING SITES
The acidic (pH 3.8) peat soil used for isolation of strain SP2T
was sampled in August 2008 from the upper oxic layer (5–10 cm)
of the Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic peat bog Staroselsky
moss, Tver region, European North Russia (56˚34
E).
The second peat sample (pH 4.0), which was used for isolation of
strain OB3 and for the molecular diversity analysis, was collected
in June 2010 at a depth of 0–10 cm of the Sphagnum-dominated,
ombrotrophic peat bog Obukhovskoye,Yaroslavl region, European
North Russia (58˚14
E). This wetland was described
previously (Pankratov et al., 2011). During each sampling event,
ﬁve subsamples collected from the particular wetland site were
combined to form one composite sample. The samples were trans-
ported to the laboratory in boxes containing ice packs, homoge-
nized by cutting the peat material into small fragments (about
0.5 cm) with sterile scissors, and used to inoculate enrichment
cultures or frozen at −20˚C for DNA extraction within 1 day after
sampling.

DNA EXTRACTION, PCR AMPLIFICATION, AND PYROSEQUENCING
Three subsamples, each of 0.5 g wet weight, were taken from the
peat sample collected from the ombrotrophic bog Obukhovskoye
and processed separately. The extraction was performed using a
FastDNA SPIN kit for Soil (Bio101, Carlsbad, USA) according to
manufacturer’s instruction. Polymerase chain reaction was car-
ried out using the Bacteria-speciﬁc primers 907F (5
-AAA CTY
AAA KGA ATT GAC GG-3
-ACG GGC GGT GTG
TRC-3
; Lane, 1991). The 907F primer included a 454-A pyrose-
quencing adaptor and a 6-bp barcode sequence, while the 1392R
primer incorporated a 454-B pyrosequencing adaptor. PCR ampli-
ﬁcations were performed in a DNA thermal cycler (model 9700;
PE Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: initial
denaturation (3 min at 95˚C); 30 cycles consisting of denaturation
(30 s at 95˚C), primer annealing (45 s at 55˚C), and elongation
(90 s at 72˚C), with a ﬁnal elongation step for 8 min at 72˚C. All
samples were ampliﬁed in triplicate, pooled in equal amounts,
and puriﬁed using Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System
(Promega, Madison, USA). Quantiﬁcation of the PCR products
was performed using Quant-iT dsDNA BR assay kit and Qubit ﬂu-
orometer (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). The puriﬁed
products were subjected to 454-pyrosequencing at the Max Planck
Genome Centre Cologne, Germany.

DATA ANALYSIS
We used Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009) to trim the primer sequences
and to remove low quality and short (<400-bp) sequences. The
sequences were further reﬁned by removing chimeras with the
UCHIME (Edgar et al., 2011) algorithm implemented in Mothur.
Taxonomy-based analysis of the resulting sequence pool was made
by using Mothur and SILVA-based template database as a refer-
ence (Pruesse et al., 2007), at a conﬁdence threshold of 80%. The
16S rRNA gene sequences of representatives of the planctomycetes
were retrieved from the total sequence pool and clustered by using
Mothur.

ISOLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF STRAINS SP2T AND OB3
Two grams of wet peat were suspended in 10 ml of sterile water and
treated in a laboratory stomacher at 240 rpm for 5 min. The result-
ing peat suspension was used to inoculate 500-ml serum bottles
containing 90 ml of sterile dilute mineral medium M1 of the fol-
lowing composition (gram per liter of distilled water): KH2PO4,
0.1; (NH4)2SO4, 0.1; MgSO4 × 7H2O, 0.1; CaCl2 × 2H2O, 0.02;

1 ml of trace element solution “44” and 1 ml Staley’s vitamin solu-
tion (Staley et al., 1992); pH 4.8–5.5. The bottles were tightly closed
and incubated in the dark at room temperature. After 4 weeks of
incubation, 20-μl aliquots of the resulting enrichment cultures
−1 of Na-
were spread plated onto medium M1 containing 0.2 g l
ampicillin and solidiﬁed with 10 g Phytagel (Sigma – Aldrich) The
plates were then incubated at 22˚C for 4 weeks in gastight jars con-
taining 5% CO2 (v/v) in air, generated by GENbox CO2 system
envelopes (Biome’rieux). Colonies and microbial cell masses that
developed on plates were screened microscopically for the pres-
ence of cells with planctomycete-like morphology. The selected
cell material was re-streaked onto the same medium supplemented
with 0.01% yeast extract and 0.025% glucose (medium M1N).
This procedure was repeated until the target microorganism was
obtained in a pure culture.

Isolates were maintained on medium M1N and were subcul-
tured at 2 month intervals. Z. formosa A10T (Kulichevskaya et al.,
2009) and Gemmata obscuriglobus DSM 5831T (Franzmann and
Skerman, 1984) were used as the reference strains in our study. Z.
formosa A10T was cultivated on agar medium M31 (Kulichevskaya
et al., 2009), while G. obscuriglobus DSM 5831T was main-
tained on medium 629 recommended by the Deutsche Sammlung
von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig,
Germany) for cultivation of this bacterium.

MORPHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL TESTS
Morphological observations and cell size measurements were
made with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and Axiovision 4.2
software (Zeiss, Germany). Physiological tests were performed
in liquid medium M1N. Growth of strains SP2T and OB3 was
monitored by nephelometry at 600 nm in an Eppendorf BioPho-
tometer for 14–21 days under a variety of conditions, including
temperatures of 4–37˚C, pH 3.8–8.0, and NaCl concentrations
of 0–3.0% (w/v). Variations in the pH were achieved by mixing
0.1M solutions of H2SO4 and KOH. Carbon source utilization
was determined using mineral medium M1 supplemented with
0.005% yeast extract and respective carbon sources (0.025%, w/v).
Cultivation was done in 120-ml ﬂasks containing 10 ml medium.

Cultures were incubated at 22˚C for 2–3 weeks on a shaker. The
capability to degrade different biopolymers was examined by mea-
suring the rate of CO2 production in tightly closed 160-ml serum
bottles for 1.5 months at 22˚C. The serum bottles contained 10 ml
of liquid medium M1 with 0.005% yeast extract as a growth fac-
tor and 0.05% (w/v) of the corresponding polymer substrate.
Control incubations were run in parallel under the same con-
ditions but without a polymer substrate. Cellulolytic capabilities
of strains SP2T and OB3 were determined using sodium car-
boxymethyl cellulose (Fluka), microcrystalline cellulose (Aldrich),
and ﬁbrous cellulose (0.05%, w/v) as carbon sources. Fibrous cel-
lulose was prepared from Whatman ﬁlter paper as described by
Pankratov et al. (2011). Cellulose degradation was monitored by
measuring CO2 production rates during incubation. CO2 concen-
tration was measured with a non-dispersive infra-red gas-analyzer
“Infralit” (Germany). The reducing sugar product was assayed
by the dinitrosalicylic (DNS) method (Miller, 1959), using glu-
cose as the sugar standard. All experiments were performed in
triplicate. The purity of strains SP2T and OB3 in the course
of our experiments on cellulose degradation was controlled by
means of whole-cell hybridization with Cy3-labeled 16S rRNA-
targeted planctomycetes-speciﬁc oligonucleotide probes PLA46
and PLA886 (Neef et al., 1998).

Oxidative and fermentative utilization of carbohydrates was
determined as described for the Hugh–Leifson test (Gerhardt,
1981). Nitrogen sources were tested using liquid medium M1N
in which (NH4)2 SO4 was replaced with one of the following
compounds at a concentration of 0.01% (w/v): KNO3, KNO2,
urea, or one of the amino acids listed in Table 1. Analyses of
enzymatic proﬁles, gelatin, and urease hydrolysis, indole produc-
tion and Hugh–Leifson test were made with API ZYM and API
20NE kits (Biome’rieux). Catalase and oxidase tests were carried
out by standard methods (Gerhardt, 1981). Cultures were tested
for growth under anaerobic conditions in anaerobic jars by using
AnaeroGen anaerobic system envelopes (Oxoid). Susceptibility to
antibiotics was determined on solid medium M1N using disks
(Oxoid) containing the following antibiotics: ampicillin (10 μg),
gentamycin (10 μg), kanamycin (30 μg), neomycin (10 μg), novo-
biocin (30 μg), streptomycin (10 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg),
and lincomycin (10 μg; Oxoid).

LIPID ANALYSES
For lipid analyses, cells of strains SP2T and OB3 were grown
on liquid medium M1N and harvested in the late expo-
nential growth phase. Lipids were analyzed using the proce-
dures described by Goossens et al. (1989). Brieﬂy, cells were
extracted with dichloromethane/methanol (2;1, v/v) and the total
extract was hydrolyzed by reﬂux in 1 N methanolic KOH for
1 h. The residue of the extraction was also subjected to base
hydrolysis. Fatty acids were methylated with diazomethane in
diethyl ether and alcohols were silylated with BSTFA [N,O-
Bis(trimethylsilyl)triﬂuoroacetamide] prior to analysis by gas
chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. To
compare the results with the lipid compositions of Z. formosa
A10T and G. obscuriglobus DSM 5831T, we used previously
obtained extracts (Kulichevskaya et al., 2009) and performed direct
hydrolysis on these extracts.

GENOTYPIC ANALYSES
Genomic DNA from strains SP2T and OB3 was extracted as
described by Marmur (1961). The G+ C content of DNA was
determined by means of thermal denaturation using a Unicam
−1
SP1800 spectrophotometer (UK) at a heating rate of 0.5˚C min
and calculated according to Owen et al. (1969). DNA of Escherichia
coli K-12 (G+ C value 51.7 mol%) was used as the standard. PCR-
mediated ampliﬁcation of the 16S rRNA gene from positions 28
to 1491 (numbering according to the International Union of Bio-
chemistry nomenclature for E. coli 16S rRNA) was performed
using primers 9f and 1492r and reaction conditions described by
Weisburg et al. (1991). The 16S rRNA gene amplicons were puri-
ﬁed using QIAquick spin columns (Qiagen) and sequenced on an
ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer using BigDye terminator chemistry,
as speciﬁed by the manufacturer (PE Applied Biosystems). Phylo-
genetic analysis was carried out using the ARB program package
(Ludwig et al., 2004).

NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE ACCESSION NUMBERS
The 16S rRNA gene sequence of Telmatocola sphagniphila SP2T
has been deposited in the EMBL, GenBank, and DDBJ nucleotide
sequence databases under accession number JN880417.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
PYROSEQUENCING-BASED ASSESSMENT OF PLANCTOMYCETE
DIVERSITY IN ACIDIC PEAT
A total of 21189 partial (average length ∼490 bp) bacterial 16S
rRNA gene sequences were obtained from the Sphagnum peat
sample examined in our study. The major groups of sequences
afﬁliated with the Acidobacteria (32.5%), Proteobacteria (24.2%),
Actinobacteria (8.3%), and Verrucomicrobia (7.5%; Serkebaeva
et al., unpublished data). This pattern of bacterial diversity is
typical for Sphagnum-dominated wetlands (reviewed in Dedysh,
2011).

The relative abundance of the Planctomycetes in the bacterial
community according to the pyrosequencing data was 5.1% (1081
reads). The diversity of the planctomycete-related 16S rRNA gene
sequences in the amplicon library is illustrated in Figure 1A by
rarefaction curves showing the expected number of operational
taxonomic units encountered with increasing sequencing depth.
Rarefaction curves showed a progressive trend to cover diversity
but did not reach the asymptote, indicating that we failed to sur-
vey the full extent of planctomycete diversity in the particular peat
sample.

Taxonomy-based analysis revealed that only 29% of all the
planctomycete-related 16S rRNA gene sequences afﬁliate with phy-
logenetic lineages deﬁned by taxonomically described organisms,
including members of the genera Isosphaera, Pirellula, Plancto-
myces, Schlesneria, and Singulisphaera (Figure 1B). The most fre-
quently detected organisms were Isosphaera-like bacteria (16.7%
of all planctomycete-related sequences), which is line with the
recently reported data on the planctomycetes diversity in oxic peat
layers (Ivanova and Dedysh, 2012). The majority (71%) of all
planctomycete-related 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from
acidic peat could not be assigned to taxonomically characterized
organisms. One of the major sequence groups within this unclas-
siﬁed diversity, however, afﬁliated with strain SP2T, one of the

as-yet-uncharacterized isolates in our collection of peat-inhabiting
planctomycetes. This isolate was obtained in 2008 from the Sphag-
num peat bog Staroselsky moss, European North Russia, and was
phylogenetically identiﬁed as a planctomycete distantly related
to G. obscuriglobus and Z. formosa (86 and 87% sequence sim-
ilarity, respectively; Figure 2). Strain SP2T-related 16S rRNA
gene sequences comprised 10% of all the planctomycete-related
454 reads obtained from the peat bog Obukhovskoye, suggesting
that strain SP2T is a typical representative of the planctomycetes
community in peat bogs. This ﬁnding prompted us address this
bacterial group in more detail.

ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION
The enrichment approach that implies the use of dilute media and
gives a selective advantage to planctomycetes was designed earlier
(Hirsch and Müller, 1985; Schlesner, 1994). In our recent exper-
iments on Sphagnum moss decomposition, we noticed that moss
(or moss-derived peat) can be used as the growth substrate for
planctomycetes, which usually develop at the ﬁnal stage of decom-
position process, after several weeks of incubation (Kulichevskaya
et al., 2007a). Therefore, we used long-term incubation of a dilute
mineral medium inoculated with peat suspension as a speciﬁc
factor to enrich for peat-inhabiting planctomycetes. Using this

approach, we isolated strain SP2T from the Sphagnum peat bog
Staroselsky moss in 2008. Growth requirements of this isolate,
however, were somewhat different from those in other character-
ized peat-inhabiting planctomycetes, and it took us nearly 2 years
to optimize its laboratory growth conditions. By that time, we

obtained the second isolate, strain OB3, from another Sphag-
num-dominated wetland, peat bog Obukhovskoye, using the same
isolation approach. Sphagnum peat sample used for isolating strain
OB3 was also used for the pyrosequencing-based Bacteria diversity
analysis described above.

Strains SP2T and OB3 shared identical 16S rRNA gene
sequences (Figure 2) and possessed a highly distinctive morphol-
ogy. On media solidiﬁed with Phytagel, the two novel isolates
formed small (1–2 mm), circular, pink-pigmented colonies with
an entire edge and a smooth surface. These colonies were com-
posed of non-motile, spherical cells, which varied in size from
1.2 to 2.0 μm and reproduced by budding. In contrast to many
other taxonomically characterized planctomycetes, buds of novel
isolates were non-motile. On aging, cells formed rosettes or large,
dendriform-like structures (Figure 3).

GROWTH SUBSTRATES AND PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS
At the stage of isolation, strains SP2T and OB3 developed on a min-
eral medium solidiﬁed with Phytagel, an agar substitute produced
from exopolysaccharide of Sphingomonas elodea. This polysac-
charide is composed of glucuronic acid, rhamnose, and glucose.
Presumably, Phytagel was used by strains SP2T and OB3 as the car-
bon and energy source. Our attempts to maintain the isolates on
agar medium M31 containing 0.1% (w/v) N -acetylglucosamine,
which was used in our previous studies for cultivation of peat-
inhabiting planctomycetes (Kulichevskaya et al., 2007b, 2008, 2009,
2012), were unsuccessful. Long-term growth optimization proce-
dures showed that strains SP2T and OB3 do not develop on agar
media. This is typical for many bacteria from northern wetlands
(Dedysh, 2011).

Major phenotypic characteristics of strains SP2T and OB3 are
listed in Table 1. These bacteria were moderately acidophilic,
mesophilic organisms capable of growth at pH values between
4.0 and 7.0 with an optimum at pH 5.0–5.5 (Figure 4) and at
temperatures between 6 and 30˚C (with an optimum at 20–26˚C).
Similar to phylogenetically related Z. formosa and G. obscuriglobus,
the two novel isolates were obligately aerobic chemoheterotrophs.
They were unable to grow in micro-oxic or anoxic conditions.
NaCl inhibited growth at concentrations above 0.1% (w/v).

The preferred growth substrates of strains SP2T and OB3 were
various heteropolysaccharides and sugars (Table 1), the latter

FIGURE 4 | Inﬂuence of medium pH on the growth of strain SP2T.

In contrast to other taxonomically characterized plancto-
mycetes, strains SP2T and OB3 displayed weak cellulolytic poten-
tial. Continuous CO2 production was detected during incuba-
tion of these bacteria with carboxymethyl cellulose, ﬁbrous cel-
lulose, and microcrystalline cellulose (Figure 5). Microscopic
examination of the respective culture liquids revealed numerous
cells of planctomycetes being attached to micro-particles of car-
boxymethyl cellulose (Figure 6, panel 1A,B) or micro-ﬁbers of
cellulose (Figure 6, panel 2A,B). The concentrations of reducing
sugars detected in the medium after 30 days of cultivation com-
prised 0.071± 0.012, 0.063± 0.007, and 0.069± 0.016 mg per ml
for carboxymethyl cellulose, ﬁbrous and microcrystalline cellu-
lose, respectively (compared to 0.010± 0.005 mg per ml at the
beginning of the experiment and after 30 days of incubation in
control). These values are one order of magnitude lower than those
commonly measured for known fast-growing cellulose degraders.
Other methods routinely employed for testing cellulose degrading
capabilities in microorganisms, including cellulose disappearance
from culture medium, could not be used for strains SP2T and
OB3 due to their very slow growth on this substrate. Obviously,
cellulolytic potential of these planctomycetes cannot be com-
pared to that in well-known cellulose degrading bacteria, such as
clostridia, bacilli, or Cytophaga species. However, it is quite com-
parable to that in some slow-growing cellulolytic acidobacteria
(Pankratov et al., 2011, 2012). It appears that strains SP2T and
OB3 can potentially play a role of slow-acting cellulose decom-
posers being, nonetheless, incapable of competing with tradition-
ally known cellulose degraders. This hypothesis is supported by
the fact that planctomycetes were identiﬁed as a numerically abun-
dant component of a bacterial community that developed in the
course of Sphagnum moss decomposition (Kulichevskaya et al.,
2007a). The ﬁnding of weak cellulose degrading capabilities in
strains SP2T and OB3 strongly extends our understanding of the
biogeochemical role of planctomycetes in peatlands and shows
that they can function as slow-acting primary degraders in these
ecosystems.

being utilized only if provided in low concentrations [below
0.025% (w/v)]. Growth inhibition of 60–70% was observed in the
presence of substrates in the medium at a concentration of 0.05%
(w/v), and substrate concentrations of 0.1% (w/v) completely
inhibited growth. A similar phenomenon was earlier reported
for the ﬁlamentous planctomycete Isosphaera pallida (Giovannoni
et al., 1987). Notably, N -acetylglucosamine was also utilized by
strains SP2T and OB3 only if provided in concentrations below
0.01% (w/v). It appears that high concentrations of available sub-
strates, which are provided in most of the routinely employed
media, is one of the reasons for low planctomycete recovery in
cultivation-based studies.

latter contains substantially more of this fatty acid (Table 2). Sat-
urated and monounsaturated C26–C32 (ω-1) hydroxy fatty acids
form a characteristic group of lipids of strains SP2T and OB3
(Table 2). They occur only residually bound. The same series of
(ω-1) hydroxy fatty acids was detected in Z. formosa A10T, but not
in G. obscuriglobus DSM 5831T (Table 2).

The neutral lipids of strain A10T are dominated by a polyunsat-
urated C31 hydrocarbon (Table 2) that has been detected in many
other planctomycetes (Kulichevskaya et al., 2007b, 2008, 2009).
Parkeol, a characteristic steroid of G. obscuriglobus DSM 5831T
(Pearson et al., 2003), was not detected in strains SP2T and OB3.
Overall, the lipid proﬁles indicate that, based on chemotaxonomic
criteria, strains SP2T and OB3 are closer related to Z. formosa A10T
than to G. obscuriglobus DSM 5831T.

In summary, strains SP2T and OB3 were clearly distinct from Z.
formosa A10T and G. obscuriglobus DSM 5831T. As compared to
Gemmata and Zavarzinella, cells of the novel isolates were smaller
in size and did not show motility; they displayed cellulolytic
activity and utilized sugars and N -acetylglucosamine only when
these substrates were provided in low concentrations [<0.025%
(w/v) for sugars and <0.01% (w/v) for N -acetylglucosamine].
In addition, the presence of a stalk, formation of rosettes or
dendriform-like structures, and ability to grow in acidic conditions
differentiated strains SP2T and OB3 from G. obscuriglobus. Unique
cell morphology, differences in substrate utilization patterns, and
a number of chemotaxonomic and genotypic characteristics sug-
gest that strains SP2T and OB3 should be considered to represent
a novel genus and species of planctomycetes, Telmatocola sphag-
niphila gen. nov., sp. nov. Strain SP2T is the type strain (=DSM
23888T = VKM B-2710T).

LIPID COMPOSITION
Both free and residually bound lipids of strains SP2T and OB3
were analyzed and compared with those of Z. formosa A10T and
G. obscuriglobus DSM 5831T. The major fatty acids of strain SP2T
and OB3 were C16:1ω5c, C18:0, and C18:1ω5c in both the extract
and the residue after extraction (Table 2). This fatty acid proﬁle is
clearly distinct from that of G. obscuriglobus DSM 5831T, which
does not show C18:1ω5c in high amounts. However, it is not that
much different to the proﬁle of Z. formosa A10T, although the
