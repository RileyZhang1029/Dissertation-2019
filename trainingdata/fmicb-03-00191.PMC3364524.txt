Approximately 42% of the human genome is composed of endogenous retroelements, and
the major retroelement component, long interspersed element-1 (L1), comprises ∼17% of
the total genome. A single human cell has more than 5× 105 copies of L1, 80∼100 copies
of which are competent for retrotransposition (RTP). Notably, L1 can induce RTP of other
retroelements, such as Alu and SVA, and is believed to function as a driving force of evo-
lution. Although L1-RTP during early embryogenesis has been highlighted in the literature,
recent observations revealed that L1-RTP also occurs in somatic cells. However, little is
known about how environmental factors induce L1-RTP. Here, we summarize our current
understanding of the mechanism of L1-RTP in somatic cells. We have focused on the mode
of L1-RTP that is dependent on the basic helix–loop–helix/per–arnt–sim (bHLH/PAS) family
of transcription factors. Along with the proposed function of bHLH/PAS proteins in envi-
ronmental adaptation, we discuss the functional linking of L1-RTP and bHLH/PAS proteins
for environmental adaptation and evolution.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately half of the human genome (∼45%) is composed
of transposable elements, most of which are endogenous retroele-
ments (∼42%; Lander et al., 2001; Bannert and Kurth, 2004).
Notably, humans have more endogenous retroelements than do
mice (∼37%) or fruit ﬂies (∼3.6%), implying a possible role
for endogenous retroelements in evolution (Kazazian, 2004). In
humans, ∼8% of the genome comprises human endogenous
retroviruses (HERV) that have gene structures similar to the long-
terminal repeats (LTRs) of lentiviruses (Bannert and Kurth, 2004).
By contrast, ∼34% of retroelements are of non-LTR types, half of
which are long interspersed element-1 (L1). A single human cell
contains more than 5× 105 copies of L1, 80∼100 copies of which
are competent for genome shufﬂing by retrotransposition (RTP;
Brouha et al., 2003). Interestingly, ∼10% of such RTP-competent
L1 sequences are “hot” and account for more than 80% of the total
RTP activity (Brouha et al., 2003).

L1 is actively expressed in embryonic stem cells (Georgiou et al.,
2009), and L1-RTP occurs in oocytes and during early embryonic
development (van den Hurk et al., 2007; Kano et al., 2009). L1-
RTP is also coupled with neuronal cell differentiation (Muotri
et al., 2005), supporting the hypothetical role of L1-RTP in the
plasticity of nerve cells. Moreover, L1-RTP was shown to be a crit-
ical event at an early stage of cell division in the fertilized egg,
although its exact role remains elusive (Vitullo et al., 2012). While
these lines of evidence strongly suggest that L1-RTP is pivotal for
early embryogenesis, recent observations indicate that L1-RTP also
occurs in somatic cells. Interestingly, some studies suggest that the
L1 copy number is increased in the human brain (Muotri et al.,

2005; Baillie et al., 2011), and greater L1 activity was detected in
patients with defective ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM ) genes
(Coufal et al., 2011). Moreover, new somatic inserts were iden-
tiﬁed in the tumors, suggesting increased activity therein (Iskow
et al., 2010; Ting et al., 2011). These observations support the idea
that somatic cells possess the machinery that is involved in the
induction of L1-RTP, but little is known about the cellular factors
required for L1-RTP. Recently, we found that L1-RTP was induced
by environmental compounds that included carcinogens (Oku-
daira et al., 2010, 2011; Ishizaka et al., 2012). L1-RTP induction by
these compounds was dependent on members of the basic helix–
loop–helix/per–arnt–sim (bHLH/PAS) protein family, which has
been proposed to be associated with the environmental adaptation
of living organisms (Beischlag et al., 2008; McIntosh et al., 2010).
Here, we provide an overview of our current understanding of the
mechanism of L1-RTP coupled with bHLH/PAS proteins, and dis-
cuss the role of L1-RTP in relation to environmental adaptation
and revolution.

L1 AND THE ROLES OF L1-ENCODED PROTEINS
-untranslated region
L1 is ∼6 kb in length and is composed of a 5
(UTR), two non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), and
(cid:2)
a 3
UTR with a poly(A) tail (Goodier and Kazazian, 2008). L1
has evolved along a single, unbroken lineage for the past 40 mil-
lion years (myrs) in primates, and ﬁve subfamilies of L1 (L1PA1-5)
have developed within the past 25 myrs in hominoid primates (Lee
et al., 2007). Interestingly, species-speciﬁc L1 subfamilies emerged
in Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes after their divergence 6 myrs
ago. In humans, active L1 (Ta-1) arose from the Ta-0 subfamily

Mode of L1-RTP by environmental factors

∼4 myrs ago, and expanded as a dominant subfamily thereafter.
Notably, it has also been shown that ∼69% of L1-inserted loci
are polymorphic for the presence or absence of the Ta-1 insert,
and that ∼90% of such loci possess Ta-1d inserts, the youngest
subset of Ta-1, which arose ∼1.4 myrs ago (Boissinot et al., 2000).
Of note, Ta-1d accounts for approximately two-third of the Ta-1
subfamily, indicating that it has been selectively expanded dur-
ing the evolution of H. sapiens. Intriguingly, humans have higher
numbers of RTP-competent L1 sequences (80∼100 copies) than
do chimpanzees (∼5 copies), although there are similar num-
bers of species-speciﬁc inserts (1200–2000 copies) in humans and
chimpanzees (Lee et al., 2007).

(cid:2)

L1 encodes two proteins: ORF1 and ORF2 (Goodier and Kazaz-
ian, 2008). ORF1 is a 40-kDa protein that acts on L1-mRNA in cis
(Wei et al., 2001) and functions as its chaperone (Martin et al.,
2005). ORF2 is a protein of about 150 kDa with both reverse tran-
scription (RT; Mathias et al., 1991) and endonuclease (Feng et al.,
1996) activities. ORF2 recognizes 5
-TTAAAA hexanucleotides in
(cid:2)
the genome and induces a nick between 3
-AA and TTTT in the
complementary strand (Jurka, 1997; Gilbert et al., 2005). It has
been proposed that ﬁrst-strand DNA is synthesized by target site-
primed RT, in which the poly(A) tail of L1 mRNA anneals to the
poly-T stretch of nicked genomic DNA (Kazazian, 2004; Babushok
and Kazazian, 2007; Goodier and Kazazian, 2008). ORF1 and
ORF2 complete the entire process of L1-RTP and also transpose
other elements, such as Alu and SVA (SINE–VNTR–Alus: short
interspersed element, SINE; variable number of tandem repeats,
VNTR; and Alu; Dewannieux et al., 2003; Wallace et al., 2008;
Hancks and Kazazian, 2012; Raiz et al., 2012), indicating that L1
functions as a driving force of genome shufﬂing.

L1-RTP IN SOMATIC CELLS IS INDUCED BY
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
REPORTED INDUCERS
The environmental triggers, gamma irradiation (Farkash et al.,
2006), and heavy metals (El-Sawy et al., 2005; Kale et al., 2005),
such as mercury, cadmium, and nickel, have been shown to induce
L1-RTP. Although it was proposed that L1-RTP induced by nickel
occurs at the post-transcriptional level (El-Sawy et al., 2005), the
precise mode of induction of L1-RTP remains to be clariﬁed.
Stribinskis and Ramos (2006) also reported that benzo[a]pyrene
(B[a]P) induced L1-RTP. They found that B[a]P-induced L1-RTP
depended on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Interestingly,
however, it was shown that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
(TCDD, dioxin), a well-known ligand of AhR (Beischlag et al.,
2008; McIntosh et al., 2010), did not induce L1-RTP. In a proposed
mechanism, ligand-bound AhR activates expression of metabolic
enzymes encoded by cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes, which in
turn convert B[a]P into a genotoxic compound that induces L1-
RTP (Stribinskis and Ramos, 2006). By contrast, TCDD is not a
genotoxic compound, and does not induce L1-RTP.

NEWLY IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND NOVEL MODES OF
L1-RTP
We recently discovered that 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole
(FICZ), a tryptophan photoproduct and a putative physiological
AhR ligand (Wincent et al., 2009), induces L1-RTP (Okudaira

et al., 2010). Experiments using short-interfering RNA (siRNA)
along with an AhR inhibitor revealed that the L1-RTP induced
by FICZ was not dependent on AhR, but required AhR nuclear
translocator-1 (ARNT1; Hoffman et al., 1991). Chromatin recruit-
ment of ligand-bound AhR is dependent on the ARNT1 nuclear
localization signal (Eguchi et al., 1997). Moreover, it was also
shown that addition of FICZ initiated the molecular interaction
between ARNT1 and ORF1, and promoted the recruitment of
ORF1 to the chromatin-rich fraction (Okudaira et al., 2010). Given
that there have been no reports indicating that ARNT1 by itself
functions as a receptor for environmental compounds, it is likely
that a novel cellular factor that functions as an FICZ receptor
cooperates with ARNT1 in the induction of L1-RTP.

Further studies demonstrated that dimethylbenzoanthracene
(DMBA), B[a]P, and 3-methylchoranthrene (3-MC) induced L1-
RTP (Okudaira et al., 2011; Ishizaka et al., 2012). Interestingly,
the results of siRNA-based experiments revealed that the induc-
tion of L1-RTP by these carcinogens depended on AhR. Moreover,
the induction of L1-RTP by DMBA required ARNT1, whereas L1-
RTP induced by B[a]P and 3-MC did not. Notably, ARNT1 siRNA
blocked mRNA expression of the CYP gene CYP1A1. Addition-
ally, it has been ascertained that the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA
depends on a heterodimer of AhR and ARNT1 (AHRC, AhR com-
plex). These observations indicate that ARNT1 siRNA efﬁciently
attenuated the biological function of the AHRC, conﬁrming that
the induction of L1-RTP by B[a]P and 3-MC was independent of
ARNT1. Moreover, the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA in response
to environmental factors requires the chromatin recruitment of
ligand-bound AhR, which is dependent on the ARNT1 nuclear
localization signal (Eguchi et al., 1997), lending support to the
notion that a cellular factor, the function of which was similar
to that of ARNT1, could contribute to chromatin recruitment of
ORF1. Since AhR forms a complex with estrogen receptor α (ERα;
Ohtake et al., 2003), we examined whether ERα was involved in
induction of L1-RTP. Notably, experiments using ERα siRNA indi-
cated that L1-RTP induced by both B[a]P and 3-MC depended on
ERα (Ishizaka et al., 2012).

It has been shown that B[a]P increased the expression of L1
mRNA (Stribinskis and Ramos, 2006), whereas nickel chloride did
not (El-Sawy et al., 2005). We also observed no apparent increase
in L1 transcripts with FICZ (Okudaira et al., 2010). These obser-
vations suggest that the modes of L1-RTP triggered by environ-
mental compounds are regulated differently at the transcriptional
and post-transcriptional levels. It is conceivable that the cellular
machinery that functions at the post-transcriptional level is regu-
lated differently depending on the compound (Table 1). Although
further study is required, the data support the idea that geno-
toxic carcinogens induce L1-RTP in an AhR-dependent manner.
Moreover, the modes of L1-RTP induced by environmental com-
pounds were different, suggesting that the integration sites of L1
differ depending on the trigger. We will discuss this possibility
further later (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1 | Schematic modes of L1-RTP triggered by environmental
compounds. Given that ORF1, which associates with retroelements, is
recruited to the chromatin, regions of L1-RTP are likely determined by the
binding partners of ORF1. As shown in Table 1, the induction of L1-RTP by
environmental compounds depended on different sets of bHLH/PAS
proteins. The induction of L1-RTP by DMBA depended on AhR and ARNT1,
whereas that by 3-MC and B[a]P required AhR. Interestingly, L1-RTP by
3-MC and B[a]P did not require ARNT1, but depended on ERα. By contrast,
FICZ-induced L1-RTP depending on ARNT1, whereas it did not require AhR.
It is plausible that the regions where these compounds insert L1 are
different: DMBA induces L1-RTP in the vicinity of XRE, whereas 3-MC and
B[a]P induce L1-RTP in the region determined by AhR and ERα. The locus of
L1-RTP by FICZ would differ from those determined by these genotoxic
carcinogens. To prove this, it is necessary to identify the association of
ORF1 and AhR and genome regions where L1 is inserted in response to
each environmental compound.

and ERK7/8 – have been identiﬁed and shown to be activated
by intracellular and extracellular stimuli (Cargnello and Roux,
2011). Among these MAPKs, the cellular signal cascades acti-
vated by ERK1/2, p38, and JNK have been well characterized
because of the availability of inhibitors. PD98059, SB202190, and
SP600125 are inhibitors of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK, respectively.
To examine the involvement of MAPKs in the induction of L1-
RTP, the effects of these inhibitors on the induction of L1-RTP

have been analyzed. SB202190 blocked FICZ-induced L1-RTP, and
siRNA speciﬁc for cyclic-AMP responsive element binding pro-
tein (CREB) mRNA efﬁciently attenuated FICZ-induced L1-RTP
(Okudaira et al., 2010). Additionally, FICZ-induced phosphory-
lation of CREB in an ARNT1-dependent manner, and SB202190
blocked the FICZ-induced phosphorylation of CREB and chro-
matin recruitment of ORF1. These observations veriﬁed that p38
is required for the induction of L1-RTP by FICZ at the step of
chromatin recruitment of ORF1. Further analysis on the mode
of L1-RTP induced by 3-MC and B[a]P revealed that the L1-RTP
induced by 3-MC was coupled to CREB phosphorylation, and that
both CREB siRNA and SB202190 abrogated L1-RTP induction by
the compound. The effects of MAPK inhibitors are summarized
in Table 1. The next challenge is to determine how MAPKs and the
phosphorylation of MAPK substrates are involved in the induc-
tion of L1-RTP. One plausible role of these molecules is driving
the chromatin recruitment of ORF1 or retroelements in response
to environmental compounds (Chiu and Greene, 2008). Several
studies suggest that retroelements, such as Alu, are present in a
cytoplasmic high-molecular weight complex due to the function
of APOBEC3 proteins, an innate restriction molecule (Chiu and
Greene, 2008).

FUNCTIONAL INTERACTION OF bHLH/PAS PROTEINS AND
L1-RTP
BIOLOGY OF bHLH/PAS PROTEINS
The bHLH/PAS family is composed of numerous transcriptional
factors with PAS domains consisting of approximately 275 amino
acids. Family members have sequence homology to the clock gene
period (per) from Drosophila melanogaster, which is involved in
the control of circadian rhythms; the arnt gene in mammals,
which is required for signaling pathways activated in response
to dioxin or polyaromatic hydrocarbons; and the single-minded
(sim) gene, a neurodevelopmental regulator in ﬂies (Beischlag
et al., 2008; McIntosh et al., 2010). It is interesting to note that
the bHLH/PAS family is involved in these three apparently differ-
ent biological responses. The PAS domain has two sub-domains,
PAS-A and PAS-B, each of which comprises approximately 70
amino acids. The PAS-A domain functions as a binding site
for other PAS-A domain-containing proteins (McIntosh et al.,
2010). In contrast, the PAS-B domain is involved in interac-
tions with other classes of proteins, such as heat shock protein
90 and small molecules. One of the best-characterized functions
of bHLH/PAS proteins is in the response to environmental pollu-
tants, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH; Beischlag et al.,
2008). When PAH binds to the PAS-B domain of AhR, a het-
erodimeric complex of ligand-bound AhR and ARNT1 (AHRC)
is formed. AHRC is then recruited to chromatin, where it recog-
nizes a xenobiotic responsive element (XRE; Probst et al., 1993)
and activates the expression of genes encoding xenobiotic meta-
bolic enzymes (Beischlag et al., 2008). Interestingly, the AHRC
also activates expression of AhR repressor (AhRR), which has
both bHLH and PAS-A domains, but not a PAS-B domain. It has
been proposed that the expression of AhRR down-regulates the
activity of the AHRC by a feedback mechanism (Mimura et al.,
1997).

Mode of L1-RTP by environmental factors

CHROMATIN RECRUITMENT OF ORF1 IS DEPENDENT ON bHLH/PAS
PROTEINS
Experiments involving the forced expression of a plasmid DNA
encoding ORF1 cDNA revealed that ORF1 is present in cytoplas-
mic stress granules in ribonucleoprotein complexes (Hohjoh and
Singer, 1996; Goodier et al., 2007). Given that ORF1 acts in cis on
L1-mRNA, it is conceivable that ORF1 is recruited from the cyto-
plasm to chromatin. Consistently, we observed that FICZ-induced
enrichment of ORF1 in the chromatin-rich fraction and also trig-
gered the physical association of ORF1 and ARNT1 (Okudaira
et al., 2010). Additional experiments revealed that carcinogen-
induced L1-RTP was dependent on AhR (Stribinskis and Ramos,
2006; Okudaira et al., 2011). These observations led us to hypothe-
size that ORF1 is functionally associated with bHLH/PAS proteins,
and that both bHLH/PAS proteins and MAPK are involved in the
chromatin recruitment of ORF1.

The importance of bHLH/PAS proteins in L1-RTP suggests that
L1-RTP in the genome induced by environmental compounds may
be directed. As summarized in Table 1, environmental carcino-
gens induce L1-RTP in an AhR-dependent manner. By contrast,
FICZ-induced L1-RTP was not dependent on AhR. Instead, it
requires ARNT1 and an additional cellular factor. Interestingly,
the dependence of carcinogen-induced L1-RTP on ARNT1 dif-
fered among compounds: L1-RTP induced by DMBA required
ARNT1, whereas that induced by 3-MC and B[a]P depended on
AhR and ERα. These observations suggest that DMBA induces
L1-RTP in the vicinity of XRE, which the AHRC targets for
induction of mRNA expression of genes, such as CYP genes. In
contrast, 3-MC and B[a]P would induce L1-RTP in the genome
region determined by AhR and ERα. Moreover, the region in
which FICZ-induced L1-RTP occurs differs from that in which
carcinogen-induced L1-RTP occurs (Figure 1). It is important
to analyze the regions of the newly integrated L1 to obtain novel
information on the roles of L1-RTP in carcinogen-induced genetic
alternations.

L1-RTP IS LINKED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS
DISEASES
GENETIC ERRORS
L1-RTP accidentally disrupts structures of functional genes and
gives rise to inborn errors (Goodier and Kazazian, 2008). Since
the discovery of aberrant insertions of L1 in the gene encoding
factor VIII in 2 of 240 sporadic hemophilia A patients (Kazaz-
ian et al., 1988), at least 20 genetic disorders have been identi-
ﬁed as resulting from L1 insertional mutagenesis (Hancks and
Kazazian, 2012). Including genetic alterations by Alu and SVA, 96
genetic disorders have been so far identiﬁed (Hancks and Kazaz-
ian, 2012). In addition, abnormal L1 insertion was detected in
a patient with branchio-oto-renal syndrome, in which L1 dis-
rupted the locus responsible for the disease (Morisada et al.,
2010). Of note, a recent study of 18 unrelated patients with
neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) identiﬁed insertions of 14 Alu,
three L1, and one poly(T) stretch within the NF1 gene, indi-
cating the retrotransposon insertions account for ∼0.4% of all
NF1 mutations (Wimmer et al., 2011). Importantly, inserted L1,
which was responsible for NF1 disruption, was Ta-1, which is
the youngest subfamily of human L1 (Boissinot et al., 2000;

Lee et al., 2007; Wimmer et al., 2011). Moreover, six differ-
ent insertions were identiﬁed within the 1.5-kb region between
exons 21 and 23. As the NF1 gene is 280 kb in length,
it
was proposed that the insertions of endogenous retroelements
into the NF1 gene occurred non-randomly (Wimmer et al.,
2011).

TUMORIGENESIS
During early studies of the alterations of cancer-related genes,
aberrant L1 insertions in the c-myc and APC genes were found in
breast and colon carcinoma, respectively (Morse et al., 1988; Miki
et al., 1992). It was recently proposed that L1 functions as a natural
mutagen for genetic alterations, and L1-RTP has been detected in
lung carcinomas and pancreatic adenocarcinomas (Iskow et al.,
2010; Ting et al., 2011). Interestingly, L1-RTP is associated with
the expression of major satellite repeats and malignant tumor phe-
notypes (Ting et al., 2011). L1-RTP induces a variety of genetic
alternations, including gene deletions, inversions, and inter/intra-
chromosome translocations (Gilbert et al., 2002, 2005; Symer et al.,
2002). Moreover, ORF2 induces DNA damage (Gasior et al., 2006).
In addition to these direct effects of L1, the human genome is sus-
ceptible to genetic alterations by Alu–Alu non-allelic homologous
recombination (NAHR; Belancio et al., 2010; Konkel and Batzer,
2010). For example, it was shown that Alu–Alu NAHR induced
structural alterations in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1, and
the MLL-1 and Myb genes, in cancers cells (Strout et al., 1998;
Mazoyer, 2005; O’Neil et al., 2007). Notably, the frequency of
deletion via Alu–Alu NAHR under conditions of p53 deﬁciency
was 40–300 times higher than that observed in the presence of
wild-type p53 (Gebow et al., 2000), suggesting the importance
of Alu–Alu NAHR during multistep carcinogenesis (Hanel and
Moll, 2012). Environmental stimuli possibly function as risk fac-
tors for carcinogenesis by modulating genetic alternations via
L1-RTP.

Although there is no model system to evaluate the associ-
ation of L1-RTP with tumorigenesis, we recently showed that
L1-RTP was common in skin tumors induced by DMBA and 12-
O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Balmain et al., 1984;
Okudaira et al., 2011). Of 15 skin tumors, 13 were positive for
L1-RTP. It has been proposed that DMBA induces H-ras acti-
vation (Nelson et al., 1992), whereas TPA promotes the growth
of transformed cells in a manner depending on TPA suscepti-
bility locus (Psl) that is located on chromosome 9 (Angel et al.,
1997). Recently, glutathione S-transferase α4 was identiﬁed as a
candidate Psl gene (Abel et al., 2010). Interestingly, it was recently
reported that activation of the H-ras gene in normal cells activates
an ATM-dependent growth-arrest signal (Bartkova et al., 2006;
Di Micco et al., 2006). Since ATM-dependent signaling causes
senescence, an additional genetic alteration is required for tumor
development; otherwise, tumor growth would be prevented. It
remained elusive to clarify how TPA-induced L1-RTP is linked
with the functional modiﬁcation of the Psl gene product and atten-
uation of the ATM-dependent growth-arrest signal. Although it
remains unclear whether L1-RTP is really involved in tumorige-
nesis, DMBA/TPA-induced skin carcinogenesis would be a good
animal model for clariﬁcation of the role of L1-RTP in tumor
development.

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
Intriguingly, a positive link between L1-RTP and the develop-
ment of autoimmune diseases was proposed recently (Crow, 2010).
Originally, heterozygous mutations of Trex1, a gene that encodes
the 3
repair exonuclease 1, were detected in familial chilblain lupus
and Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (Rice et al., 2007). Interestingly,
Trex1-deﬁcient mice provided evidence that Trex1 functions as
a negative regulator of the interferon-regulatory DNA response
(Stetson et al., 2008). Without Trex1 function, mice die due to
severe autoimmunity. However, such lethal effects of Trex1 deﬁ-
ciency were attenuated in mice with IRF3, IFN αR1, and RAG2 gene
deﬁciencies (Stetson et al., 2008). Moreover, single-stranded DNA
derived from endogenous retroelements accumulated in Trex1-
deﬁcient cells, and Trex1 overexpression blocked RTP of L1 (Stet-
son et al., 2008). Consistent with these experimental data, Trex1
activity was reduced in the synovial ﬁbroblasts of rheumatoid
arthritis patients (Neidhart et al., 2010). These observations sug-
gest that RTP-induced production of DNA derived from endoge-
nous retroelements is a potential molecular mechanism for the
development of autoimmune disorders.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
L1-RTP depends on three steps: transcription, RT, and integration.
It is known that the expression of L1 is regulated by the methyla-
tion of CpG islands in the 5
UTR region (Hata and Sakaki, 1997;
Woodcock et al., 1997; Muotri et al., 2010). Moreover, the 5
UTR of
L1 contains a ubiquitously active antisense promoter that encodes
siRNAs that effectively suppress L1-RTP (Yang and Kazazian,
2006). Although these reports indicate that L1 activity is regulated
at the transcriptional level, our observations and those of oth-
ers indicate that L1-RTP is also regulated post-transcriptionally.
Environmental compounds induce the chromatin recruitment of
ORF1 via bHLH/PAS proteins, suggesting that the functional cou-
pling of L1-RTP and bHLH/PAS proteins is another pivotal step
in the regulation of L1-RTP.

(cid:2)

Since bHLH/PAS proteins are transcription factors that strictly
recognize cis elements, it is plausible that the induction of L1-RTP
in the genome depends on the selection of bHLH/PAS proteins by
the individual compounds. DMBA-induced L1-RTP depends on
both AhR and ARNT1, and it is likely that L1-RTP is induced in
the vicinity of the XRE (Figure 1). Further study is required to
identify a target locus for the induction of L1-RTP, which would
provide novel information regarding the biological relevance of
L1-RTP in somatic cells.

It is interesting to note that Candida albicans possesses a
non-LTR-type retroelement with a structure similar to that of
human L1 (Dong et al., 2009). This was shown to be func-
tional in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that an endogenous
retroelement similar to human L1 is functional in lower eukary-
otes. Conversely, AhR homologs are present in the genomes of
lower eukaryotes such as D. melanogaster and Caenorhabditis
elegans (Hahn, 2002). Combined with our observation that L1-
RTP and bHLH/PAS are linked functionally, these results suggest
that genome shufﬂing by bHLH/PAS-dependent L1-RTP may
facilitate adaptation to environmental changes. It is tempting
to speculate that bHLH/PAS molecules recognize environmental

FIGURE 2 | Possible functional link between bHLH/PAS proteins and
L1-RTP in environmental adaptation and evolution. As a
well-characterized biological function, bHLH/PAS proteins of AhR and
ARNT1 induce gene expression of CYP genes in response to various
compounds. The induced CYP proteins metabolize the environmental
compounds and detoxify them. By contrast, L1-RTP induces genome
shufﬂing, and random mutagenesis increases the chance of the emergence
of living organisms that possess novel characteristics. As shown here,
bHLH/PAS proteins are involved in the induction of L1-RTP, indicating the
functional link between these two well-conserved cellular activities. The
novel properties can overcome the disadvantageous effects of
environmental compounds, enabling living organisms to survive under the
selective pressure in the altered environment and contributing to evolution.

pollutants and promote genome shufﬂing by RTP to generate
novel cellular properties that can overcome changes in the envi-
ronment (Figure 2). Such property of L1 might contribute to
revolution.

After the divergence of humans and chimpanzees about 6 myrs
ago, both L1s continued to propagate, and Ta-1d emerged as the
major subfamily in H. sapiens (Boissinot et al., 2000). Together
with our observation that L1-RTP is induced in somatic cells by
environmental factors, this affords the opportunity to speculate
about novel aspects of L1 biology. Since human- and chimpanzee-
speciﬁc L1 copy numbers are similar (Lee et al., 2007), it is likely
that L1-RTP in the germ cells of both species is strictly regu-
lated. However, the observation that H. sapiens has more copies
of active L1 than do chimpanzees suggests that “hot” L1 offers an
unidentiﬁed advantage to human activity. Interestingly, L1-RTP
was induced in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus when mice
performed voluntary exercise (Muotri et al., 2009), and some data
suggest that L1 copy numbers are increased in the human hip-
pocampus (Coufal et al., 2011). One plausible direction for future
research on L1 would be to focus on its role in the central nervous
system (Hancks and Kazazian, 2012).
