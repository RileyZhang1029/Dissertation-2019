We measured pools of dissolved phosphorus (P), including dissolved inorganic P (DIP), dis-
solved organic P (DOP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP)-hydrolyzable labile DOP (L-DOP), and
kinetic parameters of AP activity (APA) in the euphotic zone in the western North Paciﬁc
Ocean. Samples were collected from one coastal station in Sagami Bay, Japan, and three
offshore stations between the North Paciﬁc subtropical gyre (NPSG) and the Kuroshio
region. Although DIP concentrations in the euphotic zone at all stations were equally low,
around the nominal method detection limit of 20 nmol L-1, chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentra-
tions were one order of magnitude greater at the coastal station. DOP was the dominant
P pool, comprising 62–92% of total dissolved P at and above the Chl a maximum layer
(CML). L-DOP represented 22–39% of the total DOP at the offshore stations, whereas it
accounted for a much higher proportion (about 85%) in the coastal surface layers. Signiﬁ-
cant correlations between maximum potential AP hydrolysis rates and DIP concentrations
or bacterial cell abundance in the offshore euphotic zone suggest that major APA in the
oligotrophic surface ocean is from bacterial activity and regulated largely by DIP availability.
Although the range of maximum potential APA was comparable among the environmental
conditions, the in situ hydrolysis rate of L-DOP in the coastal station was 10 times those in
the offshore stations. L-DOP turnover time at the CML ranged from 4.5 days at the coastal
station to 84.4 days in the NPSG. The ratio of the APA half-saturation constant to the ambi-
ent L-DOP concentration decreased markedly from the NPSG to the coastal station. There
were substantial differences in the rate and efﬁciency of DOP remineralization and its
contribution as the potential P source between the low-phosphate/high-biomass coastal
ecosystem and the low-phosphate/low biomass oligotrophic ocean.

INTRODUCTION
Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for sustaining marine life
(Karl, 2000). Among the P reservoirs in the ocean, dissolved inor-
ganic P (DIP) is directly and readily available to microorganisms.
In surface waters of extensive oligotrophic ocean regions, DIP
concentrations are often below the detection limit of standard
analytical methods. Highly sensitive methods have revealed that
−1 and sometimes
DIP concentrations are often around 10 nmol L
−1 in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, the North
<1 nmol L
and South Paciﬁc Subtropical Gyres, and the eastern Mediter-
ranean Sea (Karl and Tien, 1997; Wu et al., 2000; Cavender-Bares
et al., 2001; Thingstad et al., 2005; Mather et al., 2008; Duhamel
et al., 2011).

Dissolved organic P (DOP) typically comprises the major frac-
tion (approximately 80%) of the dissolved P pool in oligotrophic
surface waters (Cavender-Bares et al., 2001; Karl and Björkman,
2002). Because the DOP pool includes many compounds that can
be utilized by marine microorganisms (Orrett and Karl, 1987;
Björkman and Karl, 1994; Karl, 2007), it represents a potential

P source for sustaining community productivity in DIP-depleted
surface waters. The majority of DOP is not readily available
to microbes, as it cannot be directly accessed through the cell
membrane; hence these compounds must be remineralized to
bioavailable phosphate prior to uptake (Cembella et al., 1984;
Björkman and Karl, 2003; Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). It is
therefore essential to characterize the components of the DOP
pool in order to evaluate their reactivity and lability for biolog-
ical breakdown. However, surprisingly little is known about the
nature and composition of marine DOP (see reviews by Karl
and Björkman, 2002; Dyhrman et al., 2007; Karl, 2007). Some
speciﬁc compounds or operationally deﬁned groups of organic
P, including dissolved nucleotide triphosphates and hydrophobic
P, have been quantiﬁed but were typically found to comprise a
few percent of total DOP in the euphotic zone of open ocean
environments (Suzumura and Ingall, 2004; Björkman and Karl,
2005).

Enzymatic hydrolysis by alkaline phosphatase (AP) is arguably
the most important pathway for marine DOP remineralization,

as AP is found in a wide variety of eukaryotic phytoplankton and
both autotrophic and heterotrophic prokaryotes (Cembella et al.,
1984; Hoppe, 2003). AP is a subclass of phosphomonoesterase or
phosphoric monoester hydrolase enzymes that catalyze ester (C-
O-P) bond cleavage, sharing characteristic alkaline pH optima.
Direct molecular analyses using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance
have shown that the majority of P in both the high-molecular-
weight fraction and the bulk fraction of the marine DOP pool
is in phosphate esters, although these analyses could not distin-
guish phosphate mono- and di-esters (Kolowith et al., 2001; Young
and Ingall, 2010). AP thus has the potential to hydrolyze a broad
spectrum of marine DOP components.

AP activity (APA) is usually regulated by the DIP supply, as the
activity increases with a decrease in DIP concentration (Cembella
et al., 1984). Therefore, APA is considered a useful indicator of
phosphate deﬁciency in ecological studies examining the marine
P cycle (Van Wambeke et al., 2002; Dyhrman and Ruttenberg, 2006;
Lomas et al., 2010). APA in marine environments can be measured
by using phosphate monoester analogs. Fluorogenic artiﬁcial sub-
strates are useful and sensitive analogs for examining APA even in
oligotrophic marine environments with relatively low biological
activity (Hoppe, 1983). Methods using single-substrate addition
in excess of saturation have been generally used for estimating
the maximum potential hydrolysis rate (V max) of APA (Koike
and Nagata, 1997; Hoppe and Ullrich, 1999; Mather et al., 2008).
Kinetic parameters of APA have also been assayed using multiple
concentrations of the substrate (Thingstad et al., 1993; Sebastián
and Niell, 2004; Sebastián et al., 2004; Labry et al., 2005). Though
the procedures are complicated and time-consuming, multiple-
concentration methods can provide detailed APA kinetic para-
meters, including the half-saturation constant and DOP turnover
time as well as V max. To date, however, there is only limited detailed
information for kinetic parameters of APA in oligotrophic open
ocean environments. Recently Duhamel et al. (2011) performed an
in-depth characterization of APA in the North and South Paciﬁc
Subtropical Gyres, investigating the kinetic parameters and dis-
solved P pools. However, the role and characteristics of APA in P
cycling in the rest of the Paciﬁc Ocean are still largely unknown.

Here we measured dissolved P pools in the euphotic zone of
the western North Paciﬁc Ocean, from the biomass-rich coastal
environment adjacent to Japan to the oligotrophic oceanic envi-
ronment in the North Paciﬁc subtropical gyre (NPSG), as well
as in the Kuroshio region and transition zone. In samples from
all of these environments, we compared V max as measured by
single- and multiple-concentration methods. We obtained kinetic
parameters for APA, including the DOP turnover time and half-
saturation constant as well as V max. Our major objectives were to
provide information on the characteristics of dissolved P pools and
APA in the western North Paciﬁc, where such information about
P cycling is largely unknown. We also examined the importance of
APA to P availability under phosphate-depleted conditions from
coastal to offshore regions to better understand marine P cycling.

was measured at station B with an underwater quantum sensor
(MDS-MkV/L, JFE Advantech Corp., Hyogo, Japan). Surface sea-
water samples were collected with a plastic bucket and transferred
to a 20-L Carboy equipped with a spigot (2322-0050, Thermo
Scientiﬁc Nalgene, Rochester, NY, USA). Seawater samples were
also collected at depths from 10 to 200 m using 12-L Niskin sam-
pling bottles on a multiple-bottle rosette sampler with attached
conductivity/temperature/depth (CTD) sensor. A 250-mL aliquot
of water samples were passed through a 100-μm nylon mesh ﬁl-
ter (47-mm diameter, NY1H04700, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA)
in an in-line ﬁlter holder (PFA-47, Advantec, Tokyo, Japan) con-
nected with tubing to the outlets of the Carboy or Niskin bottle
to remove large organisms and macro-detritus. A portion of the
100-μm-ﬁltered sample was further ﬁltered through a 0.45-μm
membrane ﬁlter on a ﬁltration apparatus (Steritop and Stericup
vacuum ﬁlter cups, 150-mL funnel and bottle, SCHV U01 RE, Mil-
lipore) under gentle vacuum (<26 kPa). The ﬁltrates were stored
frozen at −30˚C until P analyses at the laboratory within 1 month
of sampling.

CHLOROPHYLL a AND BACTERIAL CELL ABUNDANCE
Chlorophyll a (Chl a) was measured on 200-mL samples ﬁl-
tered onto 0.7-μm pore-size glass ﬁber ﬁlters (GF/F, 25-mm
diameter; Whatman, Kent, UK), using N,N -dimethylformamide
extraction and a ﬂuorometer (model 10-AU, Turner Designs,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA; Suzuki and Ishimaru, 1990). Bacterial cell
abundance was determined using the ﬁltrates from 0.45-μm-
ﬁltered samples. The sample (10 mL) was ﬁxed in neutral buffered
formaldehyde at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.74% (weight:vol) and
stored at 4˚C. Bacterial cells were collected on a 0.2-μm pore-
size, black Nuclepore ﬁlter (Whatman), and enumerated using
epiﬂuorescence microscopy after staining with 4
,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI; Porter and Feig, 1980). All reagents used in
these and other analyses were of analytical grade unless otherwise
speciﬁed.

DISSOLVED P ANALYSIS
Dissolved P was measured in 0.45-μm ﬁltrates. DIP was mea-
sured spectrophotometrically on 20-mL samples by the standard
molybdenum blue method (Strickland and Parsons, 1972) using
a double-beam spectrophotometer (UV-1600, Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan) with a 10-cm pathlength. We also used a highly sensitive
colorimetric assay for DIP determination (Hashihama et al., 2009)
in samples collected from offshore stations A, B, and C. For this
more sensitive assay, seawater samples were collected directly from
the Niskin bottles without any preﬁltration in order to minimize
contamination. The apparatus for the sensitive method consisted
of a gas-segmented continuous ﬂow analyzer (AutoAnalyzer II,
Technicon, now SEAL Analytical, Hampshire, UK) equipped with
a 1-m long liquid waveguide capillary cell (LWCC-2100, World
Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) We used the manifold
conﬁgurations, ﬂow diagrams, and analytic reagent preparation
procedures of Hansen and Koroleff (1999). The limits of detection
−1 by the standard molybdenum blue
for DIP were 20 and 3 nmol L
method and the sensitive method, respectively, as estimated from
three times the SD of the blank.

Samples for total dissolved P (TDP) were processed according
to the persulfate oxidation method of Ridal and Moore (1990).
Triplicate 10-mL samples were autoclaved at 125˚C for 4 h with
the addition of potassium persulfate (N and P analytical grade,
−1.
Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) at 4 mg mL
After samples had cooled to room temperature, ascorbic acid was
added to reduce any excess free chlorine that had formed (Hansen
and Koroleff, 1999). The DIP concentration in the oxidized sam-
ples was then measured spectrophotometrically by the manual
method. DOP concentration was calculated as the difference
between TDP and DIP.

We deﬁned labile DOP (L-DOP) as the AP-hydrolyzable
fraction of the DOP pool. We used the procedure of Feuil-
lade and Dorioz (1992) to determine L-DOP. This method was
originally developed to determine enzymatically hydrolyzable
P in sediment samples and has been applied to the hydrol-
ysis of high-molecular-weight L-DOP in seawater (Suzumura
et al., 1998). For this assay, triplicate 8-mL aliquots of 0.45-μm-
ﬁltered seawater samples were collected immediately after ﬁltra-
−1
tion and mixed with 80-μL Tris–Mg buffer solution [1 mol L
−1 magnesium
Tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 0.01 mol L

−1 sodium azide, pH 7.5] containing bovine
chloride, 500 mmol L
intestinal mucosa AP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at
−1 and incubated on board at 30˚C in the dark for
500 units mL
4 h. After incubation, the samples were stored frozen at −30˚C
until DIP analysis. The L-DOP concentration was calculated as
the increase in DIP concentration following the AP treatment.

MEASUREMENT OF APA
AP activity was measured in the whole-water samples that had
passed through the 100-μm nylon mesh ﬁlter. APA was measured
using 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUF-P, Sigma-Aldrich)
as the ﬂuorogenic substrate (Hoppe, 1983). Stock solutions of
−1 in 2-methoxyethanol (Wako Pure Chem-
MUF-P at 20 mmol L
ical Industries) were stored at −20˚C and diluted with autoclaved,
ﬁltered seawater just prior to use. Three replicate measurements
were taken on all samples to determine V max with an excess
−1). To determine the
concentration of the substrate (200 μmol L
other kinetic parameters at the sample depths, the assay was per-
formed using a series of ﬁve MUF-P concentrations (50, 100,
−1) with duplicate samples at each con-
200, 500, and 1000 nmol L
centration. Samples were incubated for 5–10 h in the dark at 25
(stations A, B, and C) or 20˚C (station H). The concentration of
4-methylumbelliferone (MUF) liberated from the hydrolysis of
MUF-P was measured using a spectroﬂuorometer (RF-5300 PC,
Shimadzu) with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 450 nm. The
concentrations of MUF were calculated from a standard curve
prepared at each sampling station using MUF (Sigma-Aldrich)
−1. The linearity of the
at concentrations from 50 to 1000 nmol L
assay within 14 h was veriﬁed using the samples from 0- to 100-m
depths at station A (Yosuke Yamada, The University of Tokyo, per-
sonal communication). Killed controls prepared using autoclaved,
ﬁltered seawater were run together with the samples and indicated
no signiﬁcant autohydrolysis of the substrate.

The autoclaved, ﬁltered seawater that served as the killed con-
trols and diluent of the MUF-P stock solution was prepared from
water collected at 2000 m in the western North Paciﬁc Ocean
(15˚N, 128˚E) in June 2006. The deep seawater was autoclaved at
120˚C for 30 min and passed through an ultraﬁltration membrane
with a nominal molecular-weight cut-off of 5000 Da (Vivaﬂow
200, Vivascience, Stonehouse, UK).

ESTIMATION OF KINETIC PARAMETERS
We used two independent protocols to determine APA kinetic
parameters. The single-concentration method using an excess con-
−1) allowed for determina-
centration of the substrate (200 μmol L
tion of V max. The multiple-concentration method using different
−1) allowed for estima-
substrate concentrations (50–1000 nmol L
tion of various parameters including L-DOP turnover time, the
half-saturation constant, and the in situ hydrolysis rate, as well as
V max. The ranges of substrate concentrations used in each method
are consistent with those used in previous studies as compiled by
Sebastián and Niell (2004) and Duhamel et al. (2010).

In the multiple-concentration method, the hydrolysis rate (v)
of the added substrate (MUF-P) can be described in terms of the
Michaelis–Menten equation as follows:

v = Vmax × Sa
Sa + (Km + Sn)

where Sa is the added substrate concentration, Sn is the concen-
tration of natural substrate (likely equivalent to L-DOP), and K m
is the half-saturation constant. We assumed that the natural and
added substrates had comparable enzyme reactivity. Additional
information is obtained from a form of the Lineweaver–Burk
equation, derived by inverting Eq. 1 and multiplying both sides
by Sa:

The increase in the fraction of added substrate hydrolyzed by APA
with time follows an exponential model:

r(t ) = 1 − et/Ta

(3)

where r is the fraction of added substrate hydrolyzed (dimension-
less), t is the incubation time (h), and T a is the turnover time of
the added MUF-P. T a can therefore be determined from a single
time-point measurement (Thingstad et al., 1993), when Eq. 3 is
solved for T a:

Equation 5 is in the form of y = mx + c, which is the equation
of a straight line; a plot of y (i.e., T a) against x (Sa) has a slope
m (1/V max). The least squares linear regression of Eq. 5 using T a
which is calculated from the experimental data using Eq. 4, gives
the turnover time of the natural L-DOP (T DOP) as the y-intercept
when Sa = 0, and the sum of the half-saturation constant and the
natural substrate concentration (K m + Sn) as the absolute value
of the x-intercept. We estimated K m by subtracting the L-DOP
concentration from K m + Sn.

CALCULATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Results are reported as mean± 1 SD, if available. For statistical
analysis, we used the program Sigmastat, included in the Sigmaplot
11 software package (Systat Software, Chicago, IL, USA). We used
a signiﬁcance level of P < 0.05.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
STUDY AREA CHARACTERISTICS
Station A was in the NPSG, and station C was located within the
Kuroshio Current (Marine Information Service Ofﬁce, Oceano-
graphic Data and Information Division, Hydrographic and
Oceanographic Department, Japan Coast Guard, 2010; Figure 1).
Station B was likely in the transition zone between the NPSG and
the Kuroshio. Salinity at 5 m was between 33.8 and 34.3 at all
stations (Figure 2A). The inﬂuence of freshwater was negligible
even at the coastal station. Water temperature at station H was
23.5˚C at the surface and 11.9˚C at 200 m. The offshore stations

exhibited relatively high temperatures of around 26.9˚C at 0 m and
19.5˚C at 200 m (Figure 2B). The moderate resolution imaging
spectroradiometer (MODIS) chlorophyll image for 19 July 2010
shows a phytoplankton bloom in the coastal area that includes
station H, and low phytoplankton biomass in the offshore area
(Figure 1). Measured surface Chl a concentrations are consistent
with the satellite observations. The surface Chl a concentration
−1 at station H was much higher than those at the
of 1.54 μg L
offshore stations (0.08–0.12 μg L

−1; Figure 2C).

The euphotic zone was deﬁned as the upper water column from
the surface to the depth at which the photosynthetically active
radiation was 1% of the value just below the surface. We could
only carry out light-depth observations at station B, where the
euphotic zone was estimated as the upper 130 m. From the sim-
ilarities in the depth proﬁles and levels of Chl a concentrations
among the offshore stations (Figure 2C) we believe that our sam-
pling depth (0–200 m) covered the euphotic zone at these stations.
The euphotic zone at station H was likely the upper 30–40 m
according to the results of Hashihama et al. (2008), who moni-
tored the depth of light penetration at a station close to station
H. The depths of the Chl a maximum layer (CML) at each station
are included in Table 1. The CMLs at the offshore stations were at
depths between 75 and 90 m, with maximum Chl a concentrations
−1. We observed a much shallower CML depth
of 0.33–0.41 μg L
(30 m) and a Chl a concentration one order of magnitude higher
(2.96 μg L

−1) at coastal station H.

Bacterial cell abundance in the surface waters at station H was
considerably higher than at the offshore stations (Figure 2D). Cell
abundance at station H, however, rapidly decreased with depth
and was in the same range as the offshore stations below 30 m.
Because we only counted DAPI-stained cells in the “dissolved”
fraction (<0.45 μm) and not in the whole-water sample, we did
not count bacteria >0.45 μm that were removed from the samples
by ﬁltration and presumably represented a considerable propor-
tion of the total bacterial community. Unfortunately, data for total
bacterial abundance in the unﬁltered seawater samples are unavail-
able. Only one matched set of data for bacterial cell abundance in
both the whole and dissolved fractions is available for the sample
collected from 200 m at station H. The bacterial cell abundance
in the ﬁltered sample was 0.73× 105 cell mL
−1 and in the whole
sample, 1.58× 105 cell mL
−1. In this sample, approximately half
(54%) of all bacterial cells were >0.45 μm and were removed by
ﬁltration.

DIP AND DOP DISTRIBUTION
At all stations, DIP concentrations were very low in the upper lay-
ers (Figure 2E). DIP concentrations at and above the CML were
at or below the detection limit for the standard molybdenum blue
−1). The more sensitive method revealed
method (i.e., 20 nmol L
that DIP concentrations in these samples were between 11 and
−1. Although DIP concentrations in the surface sam-
26 nmol L
ples (0 and 10 m) at station H were below the detection limit of
the standard method, we did not apply the sensitive method to
station H samples. For the purposes of discussion herein, DIP
−1,
concentrations in these samples were regarded as 10 nmol L
or half the detection limit. This assumed DIP concentration was
also used in calculations of DOP and L-DOP concentrations. As
a result, estimated DOP and L-DOP concentrations, which were

determined from a change in DIP concentrations, must include an
error of ±10 nmol L
−1 because of the uncertainty in the estimated
DIP concentrations.

The DIP concentration in the CML at station H (30 m) was
−1, just above the detection limit. Below the CML, DIP
24 nmol L
concentrations increased rapidly with depth at all stations. The
maximum DIP concentration at each offshore station was 214–
−1, observed at 200 m. A more drastic increase in DIP
255 nmol L
concentration with depth was observed at station H, where the
−1 at 50 m and increased to
DIP concentration reached 310 nmol L
1100 nmol L

−1 at 200 m.

The low DIP concentrations observed in the offshore euphotic
zone could partly explain the low Chl a biomass in these areas,
although the availability of other nutrients including nitrogen and
iron should be considered as well. Even though the Chl a biomass
at the coastal station was one order magnitude higher than at the
offshore stations, DIP concentrations in the coastal euphotic zone
were as low as those at the offshore stations (Figure 2). This implies
that the apparent DIP concentration is not the deﬁnitive crite-
rion for evaluating P limitation. The kinetic parameters of DIP,
including turnover time and uptake rate, can potentially be used to
evaluate DIP availability for microbial assemblages (Moutin et al.,
2005, 2008; Tanaka et al., 2011). We have no available dataset on the
kinetic parameters of DIP around the research areas. However, the
substantial difference in biomass observed between the coastal and
oceanic environments both under similarly DIP-depleted condi-
tions may indicate that there were potential differences in the rate
and extent of microbial DIP cycling.

Dissolved organic P is considered a potential source of bioavail-
able P under phosphate-depleted conditions. Among the off-
shore stations, the surface DOP concentration of 84± 3 nmol L
−1
at station A was signiﬁcantly lower than those of 96± 4 and
102± 4 nmol L
−1 at stations B and C, respectively (P < 0.05, Stu-
dent’s t -test, triplicate measurements). The depth proﬁles of DOP
at the offshore stations showed minimum values below the sur-
face (20–30 m) that gradually increased with depth, reaching 89–
−1 at 200 m (Figure 2F). At the coastal station, the
223 nmol L
surface DOP concentration of 34± 13 nmol L
−1 was considerably
lower than those at the offshore stations. However, the concentra-
tion increased rapidly with depth, reaching 263± 15 nmol L
−1 at
150 m.

At all stations, DOP concentrations exceeded DIP concentra-
tions at depths at or above the CML. We estimated the proportional

abundance of DOP in the TDP pools (Figure 2G). DOP comprised
a major proportion, representing 72.4–91.9% (mean 86.3± 5.7%,
n = 20) of TDP at or above the CML at the offshore stations. At
station H the proportion of DOP was also high above the CML,
between 62.0 and 71.7%. The percentage decreased below the CML
to 28.6–46.6% at 200 m at the offshore stations and to 33.5%
at 50 m at station H. The decrease in the DOP percentage with
depth was due to rapid increases in DIP concentrations with depth
that greatly exceeded those in DOP concentrations (Figures 2E,F).
The high proportion of DOP in the dissolved P pools emphasizes
its potential role in sustaining productivity in the euphotic zone
under phosphate-depleted conditions. We examined this poten-
tial role by determining the bioavailability and cycling of DOP
through remineralization by APA.

L-DOP CONCENTRATION AND PROPORTION OF DOP
For partial characterization and evaluation of the DOP fraction
that can be easily utilized by microorganisms, we estimated L-DOP,
deﬁned as that hydrolyzable to phosphate by APA. The concentra-
tion of L-DOP was determined as the increase in DIP concentra-
tion after incubation with the enzyme. Most samples showed a sig-
niﬁcant increase in DIP concentration (Student’s t -test, P < 0.05
from three replicate analyses). However, in the samples collected
from deep layers at station H (≥75 m), the L-DOP concentra-
tion could not be determined because there was a decrease in
DIP concentration after incubation instead of an increase. The
estimated L-DOP concentrations were 52± 7 nmol L
−1 at 50 m
and 0± 2 nmol L
−1 at 75 m at Station H, but at 200 m, the cal-
culations yielded an estimate of −87± 4 nmol L
−1. These depths
correspond to those with exceptionally high DIP concentrations
−1) compared with other stations or with the shal-
(>550 nmol L
lower depths at Station H (Figure 2E). As phosphate competes
with L-DOP for the active sites of AP, this could explain why
there was low or no hydrolysis of L-DOP if the DIP concentra-
tion was very high. However, competition by DIP is not enough to
explain the considerable negative estimates for L-DOP. Although
the mechanism is unknown, it is possible that high DIP concentra-
tions produce inconsistencies in L-DOP measurements. Therefore,
it was necessary to ignore the L-DOP data from the deep samples
(≥75 m) at station H.

Concentrations of L-DOP at and above the CLM were relatively
invariant among depths and locations (Figure 2H) and slightly
exceeded the ambient DIP concentrations. L-DOP concentrations

their respective DIP analytical methods in the Paciﬁc Subtropical
Gyres. In their studies, they used the procedures of AP treat-
ment of the conventional method for determination of L-DOP
proposed by Strickland and Parsons (1972). The higher L-DOP
concentrations found in our study could be caused by the differ-
ence in procedures for L-DOP estimation. For the method used
in the present study, sodium azide was added to minimize biolog-
ical interference during incubation. In a radio-labeled phosphate
incorporation experiment, it was shown that the addition of azide
effectively inhibited biotic DIP uptake (Lebo, 1990). Feuillade and
Dorioz (1992), in developing an assay for L-DOP in sediments,
found greater DIP liberation by enzymatic hydrolysis with the
addition of azide than without the inhibitor. Furthermore, the
enzymatically liberated DIP concentration reached a plateau in
the presence of the inhibitor, whereas the concentration decreased
after 5 h incubation without the inhibitor. Enhancement of DIP
liberation by AP treatment with the addition of azide has also been
demonstrated for L-DOP determination in oceanic seawater sam-
ples (Hashihama et al., submitted). These results strongly suggest
that L-DOP assays in samples with potentially high DIP uptake
activity should include some controls on biological activity.

The other major differences between the methods in this
and previous studies are the sources and concentrations of the
enzymes, which could result in different efﬁciencies of hydrol-
ysis. We used bovine intestinal mucosa AP at a ﬁnal concen-
−1 instead of Escherichia coli AP at 0.004–
tration of 5 units mL
−1 in the previous studies. Thus, the concentration
0.02 units mL
of enzyme in our assay was 250–1250 times that in the conven-
tional method. In tests for hydrolysis efﬁciency of DOP analogs,
(cid:2)
the hydrolysis of adenosine 5
-triphosphate (ATP) increased from
70% in the conventional method to 100% in the present method
(Suzumura et al., 1998; Hashihama et al., submitted). ATP alone
might be a negligible component of oceanic DOP pools, as it was
found to comprise less than 1% of total DOP in open ocean envi-
ronments (Björkman and Karl, 2005). However, it is possible that a
signiﬁcant fraction of marine DOP pools consists of other organic
P compounds that would be hydrolyzed less efﬁciently under low
enzyme concentration.

Although the addition of the azide inhibitor and increases in
the enzyme concentration seemed to enhance the recovery of L-
DOP in seawater, there is room for criticism of a method for
L-DOP determination based on the addition of a single enzyme
(Duhamel et al., 2011). In natural marine environments, DOP
is not hydrolyzed by one enzyme from a single source – here
E. coli or bovine intestinal mucosa – but by an assortment of
enzymes from various eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorgan-
isms. Furthermore, different species, and even a single bacterial
species, can produce a number of enzymes having different bio-
chemical properties and roles (Chichester et al., 2008). The use
of multiple enzymes in combination lead to higher recovery of
DIP, even from broad classes of organic P compounds, compared
to single enzymes (Feuillade and Dorioz, 1992; Suzumura et al.,
1998; Turner et al., 2002). More accurate estimates of true L-DOP

concentration require further research to characterize the roles of
enzymes and the properties of DOP compounds.

Although L-DOP concentrations in the euphotic zone were rel-
atively constant, there was a marked difference between stations
in the proportional abundance of L-DOP in the total DOP pool.
The shapes of the depth proﬁles of L-DOP as a percentage of total
DOP at the three offshore stations were similar, with subsurface
maxima of 31–48% around 20–30 m and relatively constant val-
ues below 50 m (Figure 2I). The percent L-DOP values at station
C were about 1.5 times those at stations A and B throughout the
depths sampled. The mean values over the depths sampled were
28± 10, 22± 6, and 39± 7% at stations A, B, and C, respectively.
Although the proportional abundances of L-DOP below 10 m
at station H were comparable to those at the offshore stations, the
values at 0 and 10 m were considerably higher, accounting for 75
and 85% of the total DOP, respectively. Here, the possible errors
involved in L-DOP determination must be carefully considered in
those samples where DIP concentrations were below the detection
−1. Including the potential error
limit and assumed to be 10 nmol L
of ±10 nmol L
−1 in the DIP determination, the L-DOP percent-
age at station H was recalculated as 64–80% at 0 m and 79–88% at
10 m. These percentages are still quite high compared with those
at the offshore stations.

COMPARISON OF SINGLE- AND MULTIPLE-CONCENTRATION METHODS
FOR VMAX DETERMINATION
The abundance of L-DOP is a function of both its production and
utilization by the ambient microorganisms in seawater. It is difﬁ-
cult to measure the DOP production rate in natural environments.
We therefore evaluated APA kinetics to derive the important
parameters of DOP utilization by marine microorganisms.

In this study, V max of APA was estimated by two different
methods: the single-concentration method, wherein the hydroly-
sis rate was measured with a single, excessively high concentration
−1), and the multiple-concentration
of the substrate (200 μmol L
method, using kinetic calculations from measurements of the
hydrolysis rate over a range of lower substrate concentrations
−1. Figure 3A shows a plot of the data
from 50 to 1000 nmol L
from the multiple-concentration method for the samples from
the CML at each station, and the relationship between the mea-
sured hydrolysis rates and substrate concentrations. Non-linear
least squares regression of these data based on the Michaelis–
Menten equation (Eq. 1) showed good correlation in all samples
[r 2 > 0.845, P < 0.01, n = 10 (duplicate measurements for each
of ﬁve concentrations)]. Using Eq. 4, we calculated T a from the
experimental data for the hydrolyzed proportion of added MUF-P
in the multiple-concentration approach. Then by linear regression
analysis using Eq. 5, we estimated V max as the inverse of the slope of
the regression line for T a vs. substrate concentration (Figure 3B).
The two methods yielded consistent results for the offshore
samples (Figure 4). This result implies that the Michaelis–Menten
model adequately described APA over a wide range of substrate
−1 to the
concentrations, from the in situ level of 50 nmol L
−1. In contrast, we
extremely high concentration of 200 μmol L
observed considerable differences between the results from the
two methods at the coastal station. At station H, V max obtained
by the single-concentration method was one order of magnitude

we also recommend the use of multiple-concentration methods
for determining V max. Considering the time-consuming proce-
dures involved, it could be difﬁcult to thoroughly apply multiple-
concentration methods on board. It might be more practical to
use both methods jointly – the single-concentration method for
most samples and the multiple-concentration method for selected
samples.

Considering the greater biomass at station H, that is, Chl
a concentrations higher by one order of magnitude and bac-
terial abundance several times higher than at the offshore sta-
tions (Figures 2C,D), the higher V max obtained by the single-
concentration method is plausible. Nevertheless, the addition of
substrate at concentrations four orders of magnitude higher than
the ambient DOP concentration seems to cause changes in APA
kinetics in some environments that are not likely under in situ con-
ditions. The use of substrate concentrations comparable to those
of the ambient L-DOP in the multiple-concentration method is
preferable, as they reﬂect the in situ condition. Even though the
single-concentration method can show the maximum potential
rate of APA, in this study we used the V max values obtained by the
multiple-concentration method for all subsequent calculations.

DISTRIBUTION OF APA KINETIC PARAMETERS
A distinguishing feature of the depth proﬁles of V max is the
remarkably high values at the sea surface at the offshore stations
(Figure 4). We found no such uniquely high values for any other
parameters in the surface samples, including DIP, DOP, L-DOP,
and Chl a concentrations, or bacterial cell abundance (Figure 2),
nor was the dissolved organic carbon concentration unusually
high (Hiroshi Ogawa, per. comm.). However, enzymatic peptide
hydrolysis is reportedly enhanced in the sea surface microlayer
(Kuznetsova and Lee, 2001). A similar enhancement in APA in the
surface microlayer could explain the markedly higher V max at the
sea surface observed in this study.

ple, V max in the surface water at this station was estimated as
29.7± 0.9 nmol L
−1 by the single-concentration method and
3.1± 0.3 nmol L
−1 by the multiple-concentration method. As
suggested by Sebastián et al. (2004), who also observed consider-
able differences in APA at different substrate concentrations, the
discrepancy between the two methods can be explained by mul-
tiphasic APA kinetics. At the offshore stations, APA seemed to be
driven by a predominance of microorganisms producing AP with
identical or very similar kinetic properties, whereas at station H,
mixed and abundant microbial populations might produce a vari-
ety of enzymes with different kinetic properties, depending on the
range of substrate concentrations.

Previous studies also found multiphasic kinetics of AP or
other hydrolytic enzymes in marine phytoplankton and bacte-
rial assemblages (e.g., Rivkin and Swift, 1980; Tholosan et al.,
1999; Dyhrman and Palenik, 2003). Sebastián and Niell (2004)
concluded that complete kinetic experiments should be car-
ried out using multiple-concentration methods, because the use
of single additions of excess substrate could give erroneous
results. Our results support their observations, and therefore

over a wide range, even in similarly DIP-depleted waters (summa-
rized by Duhamel et al., 2010). Values consistent with the present
study were reported from widely separated geographic locations;
for example, in the subtropical central North Paciﬁc Ocean (Koike
and Nagata, 1997), the Sargasso Sea (Cotner et al., 1997), and the

From linear regression analysis of the data from the multiple-

concentration assay (Figure 3B), we estimated T DOP and K m + L-

DOP as the y-intercept and the absolute value of the x-intercepts,
respectively. T DOP in the surface samples from stations B and C
was low enough that the intercept of the ﬁtted line was not sig-
niﬁcantly different from zero (P > 0.05). Consequently, we could
not estimate a signiﬁcant K m from these samples. Depth proﬁles
of T DOP (Figure 5A) show an increasing trend with depth. At the
offshore stations, T DOP at 20 m was between 16.4 and 35.5 days,
and increased to 49.1–101 days at 150 m. At station H, we found
a remarkably low T DOP, increasing gradually from 1.6 days at the
surface to 4.5 days at the CML. T DOP then increased sharply to
43.5 days at 50 m, a value comparable to those at the offshore
stations.

We estimated in situ DOP hydrolysis rates (V DOP) by dividing
the L-DOP concentration by T DOP in the corresponding sample

FACTORS CONTROLLING APA AND THE DOP CYCLE
We performed Spearman’s
rank-order correlation analysis
between seawater chemical and biological variables including con-
centrations of DIP, DOP and Chl a, and bacteria cell abundance,
and APA kinetic parameters including V max, T DOP, K m, and
V DOP, for data from 20 to 150 m in the euphotic zone at off-
shore stations A, B, and C (n = 15; Table 2). There were no
signiﬁcant correlations between Chl a and the kinetic parame-
ters, whereas a signiﬁcant positive correlation was found between
bacterial cell abundance and V max (Figure 6A). Also, there was
a signiﬁcant negative correlation between DIP concentration and
V max (Figure 6B).

AP activity is considered to be regulated by the degree of P
stress or P limitation, which is largely dependent on phosphate

Sea. Similar but non-signiﬁcant trends between V max and DIP
concentration have been found in many studies. For exam-
ple, Dyhrman and Ruttenberg (2006) reported that APA nor-
malized to Chl a concentration was elevated in conjunction
with the lowest DIP concentration off the northern Oregon
(USA) coast, and mesocosm and laboratory experiments sug-
gest that excess DIP can suppress APA (Tanaka et al., 2006;
Duhamel et al., 2010). APA regulation by DIP has been shown
to follow an inverse hyperbolic relationship rather than a lin-
ear relationship, with a transition from high to low activity
−1 (Ammer-
occurring at DIP concentrations of 10–100 nmol L

high to low APA was found around 20 nmol L
Taken together, these results indicate that APA in the olig-
otrophic oceanic environments studied here was derived pri-
marily from bacterial activity and regulated largely by DIP
availability.

K m is a measure of a substrate’s afﬁnity for an enzyme. K m
was relatively constant with depth at stations B and C, ranging
−1 (Figure 5C). We found substantially
from 111 to 395 nmol L
−1)
higher K m values at 75–90 m at station A (916–1360 nmol L
−1). We found a signiﬁcant
and at 50 m at station H (850 nmol L
correlation between K m and DOP concentration in the euphotic
zone at the offshore stations (Table 2; Figure 6C). Duhamel et al.
(2011) investigated the relationships between APA parameters and
dissolved P pools in the North and South Paciﬁc Subtropical Gyres
and found that K m in the south Paciﬁc Subtropical Gyre increased
with DIP and DOP concentrations.

A high value of K m indicates a low afﬁnity for the enzyme,
meaning that higher substrate concentrations are required for the
hydrolysis rate to approach V max. In all samples studied here, K m
was higher than the ambient total and L-DOP concentrations.
We obtained the mean K m:L-DOP ratio of 10.2± 4.7 (n = 17),

with particularly high values of 46–56 in 75–90 m layers at station
A. This result indicates that microbial assemblages had a rela-
tively low afﬁnity for the ambient L-DOP. However, this result
also implies that the microbial assemblages had the potential to
maximize their APA at higher L-DOP concentrations. A high K m
relative to the ambient DOP concentrations has often been found
in oligotrophic environments such as in the Atlantic subtropi-
cal gyres (Mather et al., 2008). Duhamel et al. (2011) also found
relatively high K m in the Paciﬁc subtropical gyres and suggested
that microorganisms were prepared to beneﬁt from intermittent
pulses of bioavailable DOP. In the present study, the K m:L-DOP
ratios at the CML decreased substantially from 55.7 at station A
in the NPSG to 4.4 at coastal station H (Table 1). We have no
direct information on DOP production rates in the study areas;
nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect a greater and more constant
supply of fresh dissolved organic matter including DOP to ambi-
ent waters from the considerably greater biomass in the coastal
area. Considerable changes in K m likely reﬂect adaptation of the
microbes to changes in substrate supply in each environment. Our
results suggest that the microorganisms in each environment stud-
ied had adapted by adjusting their APA metabolisms to potential
pulsed or constitutive inputs of available DOP. It is suggested also
that the different types of microorganisms responsible for APA

dominate microbial communities in each region, which produce
the different types of enzymes of adapting to the ambient L-DOP
availability.

As shown in Table 1, the geographic variations in the stocks
of dissolved P pools at the CML were relatively small compared
to those in the APA kinetic parameters. Concentrations of DIP
and DOP varied within the relatively narrow ranges of 11–26 and
−1, respectively. In contrast, there were relatively

large variations in T DOP and V DOP of 4.4–84.4 days and 0.01–
−1, respectively, as well as those in the K m:L-DOP

ratios discussed above. This suggests that despite the apparent
invariability in the size of dissolved P pools, the P cycle in the
coastal ecosystem was much more dynamic than those in the olig-
otrophic oceanic environments. In particular, the observed high
V DOP and low T DOP show that a large proportion of L-DOP
at the coastal station was hydrolyzed and recycled rapidly com-
pared to the offshore areas. Because we have no data for DIP
kinetic parameters such as the uptake rate or turnover time in
the study areas, we cannot directly evaluate the relative contri-
bution of bioavailable P supplied through L-DOP hydrolysis by
APA to the microbial P requirement. In order to evaluate the sig-
niﬁcance of APA in the P cycle, Duhamel et al. (2011) calculated
the daily fraction of DIP potentially released by APA as the ratio
of V DOP to the DIP concentration, expressed as a percentage of
−1). They found that
the ambient DIP pool (V DOP:DIP, % days
this daily proportion represented 2.3± 2.6% days

ing a station within a bloom that had an extremely high value of

and a typically high value of 27.9% days
The low V DOP:DIP values suggested that AP hydrolysis of DOP
might be a minor process to provide for P requirements. However,
the DIP concentration does not necessarily reﬂect the concen-
tration of bioavailable phosphate (Tanaka et al., 2006; Moutin
et al., 2008), which also may explain the low V DOP:DIP values
observed.

CONCLUSION
This study highlights substantial differences in euphotic zone
P cycles between the low-P/low biomass open ocean and low-
P/high-biomass coastal ecosystems. Concentrations of DIP and
L-DOP were low at both offshore and coastal stations. This
suggests that the apparent pools of bioavailable P are not the

crucial factors behind the considerable differences in the chloro-
phyll and bacterial biomass between the ecosystems. Measur-
ing APA kinetic parameters, we showed that DOP reminer-
alization rates were higher in the high-biomass coastal area
than in the open ocean environment. Despite the apparent uti-

lization of DOP, the V DOP:DIP values (27.9% days
gest other potential P sources could be important, such as
luxury uptake and accumulation of P in cells of phytoplank-
ton and bacteria during P-replete conditions (e.g., Thingstad,
2005).

Because we measured APA in the bulk fraction of seawater sam-
ples, our results reveal the bulk community response under the
given conditions. However, the contribution and response of AP
derived from various sources, including eukaryotic phytoplank-
ton, heterotrophic and autotrophic prokaryotes, and dissolved
enzymes as well, must differ greatly among geographic locations
and environmental conditions (Labry et al., 2005; Duhamel et al.,
2010, 2011). Enzyme-labeled ﬂuorescence assays have identiﬁed
and quantiﬁed cell-speciﬁc APA of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
cells in marine microbial assemblages (González-Gil et al., 1998;
Dyhrman et al., 2002; Dyhrman and Ruttenberg, 2006; Duhamel
et al., 2010). Further studies using cellular-level analyses as well
as bulk community responses are needed to understand the
functions of APA in marine microbial ecosystems. Furthermore,
there have been new insights into the signiﬁcance of bacterial
intracellular APA, which occurs in the cytoplasm and cannot
be quantiﬁed using common substrates such as MUF-P (Luo
et al., 2009; White, 2009). Further research into the environ-
mental factors and physiological metabolisms controlling pro-
duction and utilization of DOP is crucial for increasing our
understanding of the P cycle and its contribution to marine
productivity.
