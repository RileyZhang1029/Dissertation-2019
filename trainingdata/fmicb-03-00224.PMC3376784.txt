Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteins play an essential role in DNA replication and
repair.They use oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB)-folds, a ﬁve-stranded β-sheet
coiled into a closed barrel, to bind to ssDNA thereby protecting and stabilizing the DNA. In
eukaryotes the ssDNA-binding protein (SSB) is known as replication protein A (RPA) and
consists of three distinct subunits that function as a heterotrimer. The bacterial homolog
is termed SSB and functions as a homotetramer. In the archaeon Haloferax volcanii there
are three genes encoding homologs of RPA. Two of the rpa genes (rpa1 and rpa3) exist in
operons with a novel gene speciﬁc to Euryarchaeota; this gene encodes a protein that we
have termed RPA-associated protein (rpap). The rpap genes encode proteins belonging to
COG3390 group and feature OB-folds, suggesting that they might cooperate with RPA in
binding to ssDNA. Our genetic analysis showed that rpa1 and rpa3 deletion mutants have
differing phenotypes; only ∆rpa3 strains are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents.
Deletion of the rpa3-associated gene rpap3 led to similar levels of DNA damage sensi-
tivity, as did deletion of the rpa3 operon, suggesting that RPA3 and RPAP3 function in
the same pathway. Protein pull-downs involving recombinant hexahistidine-tagged RPAs
showed that RPA3 co-puriﬁes with RPAP3, and RPA1 co-puriﬁes with RPAP1.This indicates
that the RPAs interact only with their respective associated proteins; this was corroborated
by the inability to construct rpa1 rpap3 and rpa3 rpap1 double mutants. This is the ﬁrst
report investigating the individual function of the archaeal COG3390 RPA-associated pro-
teins (RPAPs). We have shown genetically and biochemically that the RPAPs interact with
their respective RPAs, and have uncovered a novel single-stranded DNA-binding complex
that is unique to Euryarchaeota.

INTRODUCTION
Genomic DNA must be unwound in order to be replicated or
repaired, leaving it vulnerable to nuclease and chemical attack as
well as open to the possibility of forming secondary structures.
Binding of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteins
(SSB) RPA and SSB prevents any of these events from occurring
(Lu et al., 2009). The SSB is denominated SSB in bacteria and repli-
cation protein A (RPA) in eukaryotes; they bind to ssDNA with
high afﬁnity and to dsDNA and RNA with low afﬁnity (Wobbe
et al., 1987; Wold et al., 1989; Kim et al., 1992). They play a
vital organizational role in the central genome maintenance of
the cell, providing docking platforms for a wide range of enzymes
to gain access to genomic substrates (Lu and Keck, 2008). The
bacteriophage T4 gene 32 monomer was the ﬁrst SSB to be iden-
tiﬁed (Alberts and Frey, 1970). RPA was ﬁrst identiﬁed as an
essential protein for DNA replication in the eukaryotic simian
virus (SV40; Wobbe et al., 1987) by stimulating the T antigen-
mediated unwinding of the SV40 origin of replication (Kenny
et al., 1989). RPA and SSB have now been established as essential

proteins for DNA metabolism including DNA replication, recom-
bination, and repair in all domains of life (Wobbe et al., 1987;
Heyer et al., 1990; Coverley et al., 1991, 1992; Moore et al., 1991;
Wold, 1997). The basic architecture of RPA and SSB is based
on the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB)-fold, a ﬁve-
stranded β-sheet coiled into a closed barrel, but the number of
OB-folds present varies from species to species (Bochkarev and
Bochkareva, 2004; Fanning et al., 2006).

Unlike in bacteria and eukaryotes, the architecture of SSBs
present in archaea is not uniform. There is wide diversity of SSBs
in the two main archaeal phyla, Euryarchaea, and Crenarchaea.
Crenarchaea possess SSBs similar to those of bacteria, consisting
of a single subunit with one OB-fold and an acidic C-terminus
tail (Rolfsmeier and Haseltine, 2010). Euryarchaea have RPA-like
proteins that show homology with the eukaryotic RPA, but from
species to species the architecture of euryarchaeal RPAs varies dra-
matically from a single polypeptide RPA to an RPA made up of sev-
eral subunits. Each of these RPAs can contain up to four OB-folds
as well as a zinc ﬁnger motif (Rolfsmeier and Haseltine, 2010).

RPA mutants of Haloferax volcanii

Pyrococcus furiosus RPA consists of three subunits RPA41, 14,
and 32, denominated RPA1, 2, and 3, respectively, which form a
heterotrimer as seen in eukaryotes. Strand exchange and immuno-
precipitation assays have shown that P. furiosus heterotrimeric RPA
stimulates strand exchange, and interacts with the clamp loader
RFC and both DNA polymerases B and D (Komori and Ishino,
2001). The heterotrimeric complex seen in P. furiosus is also found
in P. abyssi and P. horikoshii. However, in other archaeal species the
rpa genes have undergone lineage-speciﬁc duplications, resulting
in differing numbers of SSBs with diverse structures. Unlike the
RPA complex found in Pyrococcus spp., or eukaryotic RPA, these
do not form trimeric complexes (Robbins et al., 2004).

Methanosarcina acetivorans possesses three RPA subunits,
MacRPA1, 2, and 3, which are unlikely to form a heterotrimeric
complex as seen in P. furiosus and in eukaryotes. MacRPA1 con-
tains four DNA-binding domains (DBD) containing OB-folds,
MacRPA2 and 3 both have two OB-fold containing DBDs. Each of
the three MacRPAs can function as SSBs, and are able to stimulate
primer extension by M. acetivorans DNA polymerase BI (Robbins
et al., 2004, 2005). This demonstrates an element of redundancy
between the three MacRPAs, and suggests that the heterotrimeric
RPA structure observed in P. furiosus is the exception and not the
rule. Lin et al. (2008) suggest that intramolecular recombination
between RPA homologs may have led to the diversity of RPAs
found in euryarchaea, which can function in different pathways or
cellular processes.

A similar pattern of lineage-speciﬁc gene duplication is seen
with the archaeal MCM helicase, where the number and type
of MCM subunits that make up the hexameric helicase differ
between archaeal species. The genes encoding the MCM subunits
fall into distinct phylogenetic clades, but these do not correspond
to speciﬁc subunits of eukaryotic MCM. Instead they have arisen
through lineage-speciﬁc gene family expansion (Chia et al., 2010).
Such gene duplication might allow different archaeal species to
reﬁne the structure and function of MCM (and potentially RPA)
for differing conditions and specialized roles.

Sulfolobus solfataricus has a bacterial-like SSB consisting of a
small 20 kDa peptide containing one OB-fold and an acidic C-
terminus tail (Haseltine and Kowalczykowski, 2002; Rolfsmeier
and Haseltine, 2010). The S. solfataricus SSB quaternary structure
is similar to that of E. coli SSB, however the primary structure
of the OB-fold shows greater homology to that of the eukaryotic
RPA70 DNA-binding domain B (DBDB). This suggests that cre-
narchaeal SSBs may be structurally similar to bacterial SSB but at
a protein sequence level show homology to the eukaryotic RPA
(Haseltine and Kowalczykowski, 2002; Kerr et al., 2003). In S. sol-
fataricus there is an absence of DNA damage recognition proteins
such as homologs of XPA or XPC to initiate NER. The ability of
S. solfataricus SSB to speciﬁcally bind and melt damaged duplex
DNA in vitro suggests SSB may play a role in the identiﬁcation and
binding of damaged DNA, followed by the subsequent recruitment
of NER repair proteins (Cubeddu and White, 2005).

Haloferax volcanii encodes three RPA genes rpa1, rpa2, and
rpa3 (Hartman et al., 2010). Recent studies have shown RPA2 to
be essential while RPA1 and RPA3 are not (Skowyra and MacNeill,
2012). Note that these authors used the nomenclature rpaA1, A2,
B1, B2, B3, and C to refer to rpa3, rpap3, rpa1, rpap1, rpe, and

rpa2, respectively, while we have chosen to maintain the ofﬁcial
nomenclature as described in Table 4 of the H. volcanii genome
paper (Hartman et al., 2010). Both rpa1 and rpa3 are in oper-
ons with other genes; rpa1 is in an operon with genes encoding
an OB-fold containing protein (hereby designated RPA-associated
protein or RPAP) and a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase, while
only one OB-fold rpa-associated protein (rpap) gene is present
in the rpa3 operon (Figure 1). The presence of an rpap gene
in the same operon as rpa can be found in other euryarchaeota,
including Halobacterium marismortui, Halobacterium salinarum,
and Natronomonas pharaonis, as well as in M. mazei and M. bark-
eri. The rpap gene has been assigned to the cluster of orthologous
groups (COG) 3390 (Berthon et al., 2008).

To examine if RPA1 and 3, as well as RPAP1 and RPAP3 play
a role in DNA repair, as is true for both the bacterial SSB and
eukaryotic RPA, DNA damage assays were performed using the
single and operon deletion mutants. Cells with deletions of the
rpa1 and rpa3 operons had previously been examined by Skowyra
and MacNeill (2012). However, this is the ﬁrst report investigating
the individual function of the archaeal COG3390 RPAP. We show
genetically and biochemically that the RPAPs interact with their
respective RPAs, and have thereby uncovered a novel SSB complex
that is unique to Euryarchaeota.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All chemicals were from Sigma and restriction enzymes from
New England Biolabs, unless stated otherwise. Standard molecular
techniques were used (Sambrook and Russell, 2001).

STRAINS AND PLASMIDS
Haloferax volcanii strains (Table 1) were grown at 45˚C on com-
plete (Hv-YPC), casamino acids (Hv-Ca), or minimal (Hv-Min)
agar, or in Hv-YPC or Hv-Ca broth as described previously. Iso-
lation of genomic and plasmid DNA, as well as transformation of
H. volcanii were carried out as described previously (Allers et al.,
2004).

single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. Genes for RPA1 and RPA3 are in
operons with genes for RPA-associated proteins, RPAP1 and RPAP3,
respectively. The gene for RPA1 phosphoesterase (RPE) is present in the
rpa1 operon. Domains (not to scale) comprising OB-folds, zinc ﬁngers and a
phosphoesterase motif are shown.

with episomal overexpression plasmids as described previously
(Allers et al., 2010). Plasmids for protein expression are shown in
Table 2, and were generated by PCR using oligonucleotides shown
in Table 3. Template DNA for the PCRs was isolated from genomic
DNA.

UV IRRADIATION ASSAYS
UV irradiation assays were carried out as described previously
(Delmas et al., 2009).

MITOMYCIN C ASSAYS
Mitomycin C (MMC) assays were carried out as described
previously (Lestini et al., 2010).

PROTEIN OVEREXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION
Protein overexpression was carried out as described previously
(Allers et al., 2010) with the following amendments: cultures
were incubated at 45˚C overnight to an OD650 of 0.5, when pro-
tein expression was induced by adding 3 mM Trp to the culture

followed by incubation at 45˚C, with shaking for a further 1 h until
OD650 ≈ 0.7.
PROTEIN PRECIPITATION
Deoxycholate was added to 0.015%, vortexed, and incubated for
10 min at room temperature. Trichloroacetic acid was added to
7.2% and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Samples were
centrifuged at 14,000× g at room temperature for 8 min. Super-
natant was removed and precipitated protein resuspended in 15 µl
resuspension buffer (330 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 2.6% SDS, 17 mM
NaOH, 5% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml bromophenol blue). Samples were
heated for 10 min at 94˚C and cooled on ice before loading onto
an SDS-PAGE gel.

MASS SPECTROMETRY
Mass spectrometry of excised protein bands was carried out
as described previously (Allers et al., 2010). Details of protein
identiﬁcation are given in the Table A1 in Appendix.

RESULTS
RPA3 BUT NOT RPA1 FUNCTIONS IN DNA REPAIR
In eukaryotes, speciﬁcally Saccharomyces cerevisiae, all three RPA
subunits have been shown to be essential for cell survival (Brill
and Stillman, 1991). Work by Skowyra and MacNeill (2012) has
shown that H. volcanii rpa2 is essential, which is in agreement
with our fruitless attempts to delete rpa2 (data not shown). To
examine if the other rpa genes of H. volcanii are also essential,

RPA mutants of Haloferax volcanii

genomic deletions of rpa1 and rpa3 were generated using the
counter selective pop-in/pop-out method (Allers et al., 2004). To
generate the deletion constructs by PCR, rpa1 and rpa3 operons
were ﬁrst isolated from wild-type (WT) H. volcanii using native
BspEI and EcoRI/Not I restriction sites, respectively, to generate
genomic libraries. These were then screened for the presence of
the rpa1 and rpa3 operons, individually, using colony hybridiza-
tion. The isolated plasmids, pTA937 (rpa1 operon) and pTA884
(rpa3 operon) were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing. Deletion con-
structs for rpa1 and rpa3 were designed to avoid polar effects on
the expression of the downstream rpap genes by maintaining the
reading frame. Genomic deletions of both rpa1 and rpa3 (trpA-
marked) were successful, generating strains H1217 and H1244,
respectively (Figures 2 and 3, respectively). The ability to delete
both rpa1 and rpa3 with relative ease, but not rpa2, indicates
that the cellular requirement for each RPA is not equal, making
it unlikely that they function collectively.

Both eukaryotic and bacterial SSB are involved in DNA repair.
To examine if H. volcanii RPA1 and RPA3 function in DNA
repair, the effects of DNA damage on cell survival of H1217
and H1244 were examined. UV irradiation results in the for-
mation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 pyrimidine-
pyrimidone dimer photoproducts, as well as ssDNA nicks that
indirectly generate double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). The
latter require repair by homologous recombination (HR) or
single-strand DNA annealing (Fousteri and Mullenders, 2008;
Rouillon and White, 2011). MMC is a chemotherapeutic agent
that reacts with DNA generating covalent interstrand cross-
links, requiring removal by nucleotide excision repair (NER) and
HR (Tomasz et al., 1987). The ∆rpa1 mutant H1217 was no
more sensitive than the WT to UV and MMC-induced DNA
damage, however the ∆rpa3 mutant H1244 exhibited moder-
ate sensitivity to both UV and MMC-induced DNA damage
(Figure 4).

RPAP3 BUT NOT RPAP1 FUNCTIONS IN DNA REPAIR
Analysis of predicted protein domains indicates that RPA1 and
RPA3 both possess zinc ﬁnger domains, and that RPA1 has
three OB-folds compared to the single OB-fold present in RPA3
(Figure 1). Both COG3390 RPAPs RPAP1 and RPAP3 possess a
single OB-fold suggesting a possible role in DNA binding. The
RPA1 phosphoesterase (RPE) has a calcineurin-like phospho-
esterase domain, and was not investigated individually. However,
our results and those of Skowyra and MacNeill (2012) show that
rpe is a non-essential gene.

To study the roles of RPAP1 and RPAP3 in DNA repair, ∆rpap1
(H1216) and ∆rpap3 (H1410) mutants were generated, both using
trpA-marked deletion constructs (Figures 2 and 3, respectively).
As with ∆rpa1 strain H1217, the ∆rpap1 mutant H1216 showed no
increased sensitivity to UV irradiation or to MMC-induced DNA
damage. However, the ∆rpap3 deletion mutant H1410 was hyper-
sensitive to both types of DNA damage, and the level of sensitivity
was similar to that exhibited by the ∆rpa3 mutant H1244.

We examined whether the absence of both RPA and RPAP
results in a synergistic deﬁciency in DNA repair. Genomic dele-
tions of the rpa1 and rpa3 operons were generated in strains H1246
and H1260, respectively, with only the latter being a trpA-marked

deletion (Figures 2 and 3, respectively); deletions of the rpa1 and
rpa3 operons have previously been reported by Skowyra and Mac-
Neill (2012). The ∆rpa1 operon mutant showed no increased
sensitivity to UV irradiation or to MMC-induced DNA damage.
However the ∆rpa3 operon deletion mutant was hypersensitive to
both types of DNA damage, and the level of sensitivity was sim-
ilar to that exhibited by the single ∆rpa3 and ∆rpap3 mutants
H1244 and H1410, respectively (Figure 4). This result suggests
that RPA3 and RPAP3 function in the same pathway(s) of DNA
repair.

REDUNDANCY BETWEEN RPA1 AND RPA3 OPERONS
In order to test for redundancy between the two RPAs, an attempt
was made to generate a double ∆rpa1 operon ∆rpa3 operon dele-
tion. This involved constructing the strain H1282, which contained
the pop-in of a trpA-marked ∆rpa3 operon construct (pTA1207)
in an unmarked ∆rpa1 operon background (H1246). An episo-
mal plasmid (pTA1265), marked with pyrE2 and providing in trans
expression of the rpa1 operon was used for complementation dur-
ing the pop-out step (note that this episomal plasmid is lost during
counter-selection with 5-FOA). Neither of the two pop-outs gen-
erated from this strain (H1390) yielded the desired ∆rpa1 operon

RPA mutants of Haloferax volcanii

CONSTRUCTION OF PROTEIN OVEREXPRESSION STRAIN WITH
C-TERMINAL TRUNCATION OF CDC48D
In a previous publication (Allers et al., 2010), we constructed
a strain of H. volcanii where the histidine-rich pitA gene is
replaced by the ortholog from N. pharaonis. The latter protein
lacks the histidine-rich linker region found in H. volcanii PitA
and does not co-purify with His-tagged recombinant proteins.
The absence of Hvo-PitA revealed an additional co-purifying
protein, which we identiﬁed as Cdc48d (HVO_1907) and fea-
tures a histidine-rich C-terminus (Figure 5A). We were unable
to delete cdc48d, indicating that this gene is essential (Allers et al.,
2010). The presence of this contaminating protein was problematic
for puriﬁcation of His-tagged RPA1 and RPAP1, due to simi-
lar molecular weights (Cdc48d, 53 kDa; RPA1, 46 kDa; RPAP1,
65 kDa).

All orthologs of Cdc48d from haloarchaea feature a histidine-
rich C-terminus, however Cdc48d from Haloarcula marismortui
and H. salinarum have only three and four histidines, respec-
tively, compared to six in H. volcanii (Figure 5A). Therefore, we
replaced the H. volcanii cdc48d gene in H1209 (Allers et al., 2010)
with orthologous genes from H. marismortui and H. salinarum,
generating H. volcanii strains H1405 and H1333, respectively.
Unfortunately these strains grew poorly and were not suitable
for recombinant protein overexpression. Instead, we generated a
truncated allele of H. volcanii cdc48d, encoding a Cdc48d protein
lacking the histidine-rich C-terminus (Cdc48d-Ct; Figure 5A).
The cdc48d-Ct allele was used to replace the H. salinarum cdc48d
gene in H. volcanii H1333, generating H1424 (Figures 5B,C).
This strain exhibits normal cell growth and the Cdc48d-Ct pro-
tein no longer co-puriﬁes with His-tagged recombinant pro-
teins (Figure 5D). A number of minor histidine-rich contam-
inants are now apparent, which have been identiﬁed by mass
spectrometry.

DIRECT RPAP INTERACTION WITH RESPECTIVE RPA
The genetic analysis of rpa1 and rpa3 and their respective rpap
genes indicates not only that RPA3 and RPAP3 function in the
same DNA repair pathway(s), but also that they function together
as a speciﬁc RPA:RPAP complex. To establish whether this is
achieved via a direct RPA:RPAP interaction, afﬁnity pull-downs
were employed (Allers et al., 2010). The rpa1 and rpa3 operons
were cloned under control of the tryptophanase promoter in plas-
mid pTA963, where either the RPA or the RPAP was tagged with a
hexahistidine tag.

Histidine-tagged RPA1 and RPA3 pulled down their respec-
tive RPAPs, and histidine-tagged RPAP1 and RPAP3 pulled down
their respective RPAs (Figure 6). However, histidine-tagged RPA1
did not pull down RPAP3, and vice versa. This conﬁrms that
the RPAs interact speciﬁcally with their respective RPAPs, sup-
porting our conclusions based on the failure to generate ∆rpa1
∆rpap3 and ∆rpa3 ∆rpap1 deletion mutants. Neither RPA1
nor RPA3 pulled down RPA2, and histidine-tagged RPA2 did
not pull down RPA1 or 3, or either of the RPAPs (data not
shown). This supports the suggestion that the three RPAs of H.
volcanii do not form a heterotrimer as observed in eukaryotes
and P. furiosus, but instead form three separate ssDNA-binding
factors.

FIGURE 4 | (A) Wild-type (WT), rpa1, rpap1, rpa1 operon, rpa3, rpap3, rpa3
operon (H195, H1217, H1216, H1246, H1244, H1410, and H1260,
respectively), were plated out and exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The
average and standard error (SE) of three experiments are shown. (B) The
strains shown in (A) were plated out and exposed to mitomycin C (MMC).
The average and SE of three experiments are shown.

∆rpa3 operon mutant (see Figure A1 in Appendix). This indicates
that the cell requires either RPA1 or RPA3 (and/or their respective
RPAPs) for survival.

Next we attempted to generate ∆rpa1 ∆rpap3 and ∆rpa3
∆rpap1 deletion mutants. This would test whether the RPAPs
can complement each other, or whether they are instead spe-
ciﬁc for their respective RPAs. The trpA-marked ∆rpap3 con-
struct (pTA1284) was used in an unmarked ∆rpa1 background
(H1280), and the trpA-marked ∆rpa3 construct (pTA1207) was
used in an unmarked ∆rpap1 background (H1281). In both cases
two pop-outs were generated but none proved to be the desired
deletions (see Figure 1 in Appendix). This suggests that the puta-
tive RPA:RPAP complex is dependent upon speciﬁc RPA:RPAP
interactions for functionality.

DISCUSSION
There is a unifying theme in archaea of a great variety in the num-
ber and type of proteins involved in DNA replication, and repair,
whose counterparts in eukaryotes are much more uniform. This
has been shown to be the case for RPA, where eukaryotes possess
three subunits that all form uniﬁed clades in a phylogenetic analy-
sis, but in archaea the number and structure of subunits varies
widely. Some euryarchaea possess differing numbers of RPA sub-
units and some possess differing numbers of RPAs and RPAPs.
Crenarchaea also possess varying numbers of SSB, however in
both euryarchaea and crenarchaea none of the RPAs, RPAPs, or
SSBs fall into uniﬁed clades. Again this is seen in the case of MCM,
where eukaryotes possess six MCM subunits that each form uni-
ﬁed clades, but in archaea there is a vast range in the number of
MCM subunits, differing between individual species, and none of
which fall into uniform clades (Chia et al., 2010). Characterizing
the RPA-RPAP complexes of H. volcanii will shed light on how
the RPAs and RPAPs function together in binding and stabilizing

ssDNA. This in turn will provide insight for other RPAs and RPAPs
in archaea, but also offer reasoning behind the driving force of such
non-uniform evolution of archaea.

The genetic and biochemical analysis presented here indicates
the three RPAs of H. volcanii do not form a heterotrimeric com-
plex as in P. furiosus and eukaryotes. Instead, RPA1 and RPA3 form
complexes with their respective RPAPs. Unlike rpa2, both rpa1 and
rpa3 genomic deletions were generated with relative ease, showing
that the latter are not essential for cell survival and supporting
the hypothesis that the three RPAs do not form a heterotrimeric
complex.

The ease at which the rpa1, rpap1, and rpa1 operon deletion
mutants were made, coupled with a lack DNA damage sensitivity,
signiﬁes the rpa1 operon does not play a major role in DNA repli-
cation or repair. The moderate DNA damage sensitivity shown by
the individual rpa3, rpap3, and the rpa3 operon mutants indi-
cates that the efﬁcient repair of UV and MMC-induced DNA
damage requires the products of the rpa3 operon but not the

rpa1 operon. However, it proved impossible to generate a dou-
ble ∆rpa1 operon ∆rpa3 operon deletion, showing that cellular
growth requires either RPA1 or RPA3.

Both single ∆rpa3 and ∆rpap3 mutants showed a similar DNA
damage sensitivity to each other, and to the rpa3 operon mutant,
providing genetic evidence that RPA3 and RPAP3 act in the same
DNA repair pathway. Furthermore, we were unable to generate
∆rpa1 ∆rpap3 and ∆rpa3 ∆rpap1 deletion mutants, indicating
that RPAP1 could not substitute for RPAP3 (and vice versa), and
suggesting that the RPA3 interacts speciﬁcally with RPAP3 (and
likewise for RPA1 and RPAP1). However it is unclear what role
the associated proteins play, since the presence of an OB-fold does
not necessarily indicate direct ssDNA binding. Instead, the RPAPs
may provide a platform for protein:protein interactions. This is
seen in eukaryotes, where the RPA 14 kDa subunit possesses a sin-
gle OB-fold, this subunit is essential for formation of the RPA
heterotrimer by facilitating protein:protein interactions (Fanning
et al., 2006).

The co-puriﬁcation of histidine-tagged RPA1 and RPA3 with
their respective untagged RPAPs (and vice versa) supports our
hypothesis that H. volcanii RPA1 and RPA3 form complexes with
their respective RPAPs. This observation, and the differing out-
comes of rpa1, rpa2, and rpa3 deletions, indicates that the three
RPAs of H. volcanii do not function as a heterotrimer. Similar

results have been obtained in M. acetivorans, where the three RPAs
are able to bind ssDNA individually, in addition to stimulating
primer extension by M. acetivorans DNA polymerase BI in vitro.
(Robbins et al., 2004).

This study has shown genetically and biochemically that RPAPs
interact with RPAs, and that this interaction is RPA-speciﬁc. This is
the ﬁrst report investigating the function of the archaeal COG3390
RPA-associated proteins (RPAPs), thus providing an important
insight of the structure and function of H. volcanii single-strand
DNA-binding proteins.

RPA mutants of Haloferax volcanii

FIGURE A1 | (A) Map of rpa3 operon indicating location of ∆rpa3, ∆rpap3,
and ∆rpa3 operon deletions, as well as the AscI and StuI sites and the probe
used to verify the deletions. The size of this fragment in the wild-type (H195)
is 8 kb. (B) Southern blot of genomic DNA cut with AscI and StuI, and probed
with ﬂanking regions of rpa3 operon (rpa3 op.), as shown in (A), indicates
failure to generate ∆rpa1 ∆rpap3 mutant as bands of the expected size for
deletion are not seen (3.4 and 4.4 kb). (C) Southern blot of genomic DNA cut

with AscI and StuI, and probed with ﬂanking regions of rpa3 op., as shown in
(A), indicates failure to generate ∆rpap1 ∆rpa3 mutant as bands of the
expected size for deletion are not seen (2.8 and 5 kb). (D) Southern blot of
genomic DNA cut with AscI and StuI, and probed with ﬂanking regions of
rpa3 op., as shown in (A) indicates failure to generate ∆rpa1 operon ∆rpa3
operon mutant as bands of the expected size for deletion are not seen (2.8
and 3.4 kb).
