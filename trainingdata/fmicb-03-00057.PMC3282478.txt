The anaerobic oxidation of Fe(II) by subsurface microorganisms is an important part of bio-
geochemical cycling in the environment, but the biochemical mechanisms used to couple
iron oxidation to nitrate respiration are not well understood. Based on our own work and the
evidence available in the literature, we propose a mechanistic model for anaerobic nitrate-
dependent iron oxidation. We suggest that anaerobic iron-oxidizing microorganisms likely
exist along a continuum including: (1) bacteria that inadvertently oxidize Fe(II) by abiotic
or biotic reactions with enzymes or chemical intermediates in their metabolic pathways
(e.g., denitriﬁcation) and suffer from toxicity or energetic penalty, (2) Fe(II) tolerant bacteria
that gain little or no growth beneﬁt from iron oxidation but can manage the toxic reactions,
and (3) bacteria that efﬁciently accept electrons from Fe(II) to gain a growth advantage
while preventing or mitigating the toxic reactions. Predictions of the proposed model are
highlighted and experimental approaches are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, signiﬁcant progress has been made toward under-
standing the biochemical mechanisms used by bacteria to catalyze
the aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of Fe(II) in the environ-
ment. Recent reviews focus on aerobic/microaerobic iron oxida-
tion (Emerson et al., 2010) and iron oxidation by acidophiles and
anoxygenic phototrophs (Bird et al., 2011), however a number
of microorganisms have been described which can couple iron
oxidation to nitrate reduction (Chaudhuri et al., 2001; Weber
et al., 2001, 2006a,b; Finneran et al., 2002; Lack et al., 2002;
Muehe et al., 2009) in the absence of oxygen and light. The
growth beneﬁt from anaerobic iron oxidation varies widely. In
both photosynthetic and nitrate reducing bacteria, oxidation of
Fe(II) may represent an important detoxiﬁcation strategy (Muehe
et al., 2009; Poulain and Newman, 2009), and in some cases may
have also evolved into a metabolic strategy (Widdel et al., 1993;
Croal et al., 2007; Jiao and Newman, 2007; Muehe et al., 2009;
Weber et al., 2009; Chakraborty et al., 2011). In this paper, we sug-
gest that the success of an iron-oxidizing microorganism depends
on the extent to which electron donation from Fe(II) can be
controlled and toxic reactions prevented or managed. We pro-
pose working models to analyze the results of experiments aimed
at elucidating the mechanisms of iron oxidation by anaerobic
nitrate reducing bacteria. We also highlight some of the predic-
tions of the models that future experiments should address. Our
intention is not to exhaustively review the literature, but rather
to highlight some of the salient features of anaerobic nitrate-
dependent iron oxidation and provide insight for new research
directions.

RUSTING AWAY IN THE DARK, WITHOUT OXYGEN:
EVIDENCE FOR ANAEROBIC NITRATE-DEPENDENT IRON
OXIDATION BY ENVIRONMENTAL BACTERIA
Bacterial species that couple the oxidation of Fe(II) to nitrate
reduction have been isolated from a wide range of habitats and
are phylogenetically diverse (Hafenbradl et al., 1996; Straub et al.,
1996; Chaudhuri et al., 2001). Iron-oxidizing microbes have been
demonstrated to oxidize both soluble and insoluble Fe(II) (Wid-
del et al., 1993; Chaudhuri et al., 2001; Weber et al., 2001, 2006c),
and to produce a variety of insoluble Fe(III) mineral products
(Machulla et al., 1998; Straub and Buchholz-Cleven, 1998; Chaud-
huri et al., 2001; Weber et al., 2006c). Although the metabolism is
based on thermodynamically favorable redox reactions (Koppenol,
1996; Bartberger et al., 2002; Shaﬁrovich and Lymar, 2002; Dut-
ton et al., 2005; Flores-Santana et al., 2011), little is known about
the mechanisms used by anaerobic neutrophilic nitrate-dependent
iron oxidizers (Weber et al., 2006a; Bird et al., 2011). However, a few
studies do suggest an energetic beneﬁt from this metabolism for
the organisms involved (Muehe et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2009).
Figure 1 presents several conceivable mechanisms for obtaining
energetic beneﬁt from iron oxidation catalyzed by anaerobic den-
itrifying bacteria. Some of these mechanisms may be inducible
in specialized iron-oxidizing microorganisms, while others may
be general to all nitrate reducing bacteria. One of these mech-
anisms (electron sparing ) includes both enzymatically mediated
components and abiotic interactions between Fe(II) and reactive
intermediates resulting in a net energy gain. These mechanisms
may be mutually exclusive, but based on reactive species formed
during metabolism, it is more likely that hybrid abiotic/biotic

PMF. It is important to note that nitrate reductases with periplas-
−
mic sites for NO
3 , such as Nap, consume periplasmic protons to
reduce nitrate and no energetic beneﬁt would result from Fe(II)
electron donation to catalyze NO

−
3 reduction by Nap.

A DEDICATED Fe(II) OXIDOREDUCTASE
A dedicated Fe(II): menaquinone oxidoreductase protein, or pro-
tein complex, could oxidize iron at the cell surface or in the
periplasm and reduce the quinone pool, providing reducing equiv-
alents for downstream nitrogen oxide reductases (Figure 1A)
allowing for proton motive force (PMF) generation. This mecha-
nism predicts inducibility of iron oxidation and the expression of
a speciﬁc protein or proteins in response to Fe(II).

DIRECT ELECTRON DONATION TO NITRATE REDUCTASE
In this model a standard membrane bound Nar could serve as the
combined Fe(II) oxidase and nitrate reductase. If Nar can accept
−
electrons from Fe(II) to catalyze cytoplasmic NO
3 reduction to
−
NO
2 and H2O, two protons are consumed in the cytoplasm with-
out the need for electrons from NADH resulting in an enhanced
PMF (Figure 1B). Although, this mechanism may be inducible, it
is unlikely as Nar will be expressed during nitrate reducing con-
ditions regardless. As such, it could be an inadvertent mechanism

of dissimilatory nitrate reduction using Nar. NO

CYTOCHROME bc1 COMPLEX MEDIATED Fe(II) OXIDATION
A third possibility is that the cytochrome bc 1 complex can accept
electrons from Fe(II) and reduce the quinone pool This is similar
to the proposed mechanism that Acidithiobacillus and anoxy-
genic phototrophs use to generate NADH from Fe(II) oxida-
tion (Figure 1C; Bird et al., 2011). In these metabolisms, the
cytochrome bc 1 complex is proposed to be involved in reverse
electron transfer to reduce the quinone pool (Bird et al., 2011).
The exact mechanism and the net proton translocation asso-
ciated with reverse electron transfer by bc 1 is not well under-
stood, but is thought to be at the expense of the PMF (Ferguson
and Ingledew, 2008). For neutrophilic iron oxidation, the redox
potential of Fe(III)/Fe(II) is low enough to reduce menaquinone
(cid:2) =−0.074 V; Wagner et al., 1974; Schoepp-Cothenet et al.,
(E˚
2009). However, for this mechanism to generate a PMF, the
quinone pool must obtain protons from the cytoplasm upon
reduction by the bc 1 complex, and release those protons into the
periplasm upon oxidation. Coupled to a quinol dehydrogenase,
this would provide net proton translocation (Note: some NorBC
are quinol dehydrogenases; Kraft et al., 2011). We envision that
alternating ﬂuxes of acetate and nitrate in the environment could

Anaerobic iron oxidation mechanisms

be harnessed by a bc 1 ferroxidase in this way. When high acetate
concentrations are present, electrons ﬂow through cytochrome c
to sustain denitriﬁcation, and iron oxidation by bc 1 is minimal.
As acetate becomes scarce, the quinone pool is largely oxidized,
and electrons from iron could be used to reduce the quinone pool
at bc 1.

ELECTRON SPARING
A fourth mechanism for obtaining an energetic beneﬁt from
Fe(II) oxidation involves differential electron ﬂow to the termi-
nal reductases. If more protons are translocated per electron at the
nitrate reductase (Nar) than at downstream reductases coupled
to bc 1, then a shift in electron ﬂow to Nar would be beneﬁcial
(Figure 1D). If this is the case, under heterotrophic growth con-
−
ditions with excess electron acceptor (e.g., NO
3 ), abiotic redox
−
reactions between Fe(II) and NO
2 and other nitrogen oxides
would allow greater net proton translocation per electron from
Complex I. We refer to this phenomenon as electron sparing.
More nitrate would be consumed in such a mechanism, but an
energetic beneﬁt to the organism would be gained per mole of
electron donor (i.e., organic co-substrate, H2). This mechanism
only applies to iron oxidizers when a co-substrate is available as
an electron donor, and could be more pronounced when abiot-
ically produced nitrogen oxide gases are continuously removed,
as in ﬂow through experimental setups. However, when electron
acceptor is limiting, such reactions are likely to lead to a growth
disadvantage due to a loss of electron accepting capacity. This
hypothesis can be tested by looking for differences in growth on
Fe(II) under donor or acceptor limiting conditions in batch cul-
ture. It is also important to emphasize that the location of the Fe(II)
−
reaction with NO
2 is potentially very important in determining
the consequences for the bacterial cell. If the reaction happens in
the periplasm, insoluble Fe(III) crusts may be harmful, but if the
−
reaction happens outside of the cell, the NO
2 could react with
insoluble Fe(II) in minerals without negative consequences for
the cell.

THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE CELL: EVIDENCE FOR ABIOTIC
REDUCTION OF NITROGEN OXIDES CATALYZED BY SOLUBLE
Fe(II) AND INSOLUBLE Fe(II) MINERALS
Regardless of whether abiotic reactions of nitrogen oxides and
Fe(II) can lead to an energetic beneﬁt through electron sparing,
uncoupling the denitriﬁcation pathway is likely to create a signif-
icant ﬂux of toxic reactive nitrogen species. The characterization
of these products and the mechanisms whereby microorganisms
cope with the toxicity will lead to an understanding of the beneﬁt
or cost of microbial iron oxidation.

The abiotic reaction of nitrate (NO

) with soluble Fe(II)
is slow (Moraghan and Buresh, 1977). However, the reaction
) and soluble Fe(II) is rapid (Moraghan and Buresh,
between (NO
1977). The products of the abiotic reactions vary with pH and

include NO, N2O, and NH

ture and neutral pH (Moraghan and Buresh, 1977; Ottley et al.,
1997). Green rusts (GR), mixed Fe(II)/Fe(III) hydroxides, can
also catalyze the reduction of nitrogen oxides (Figure 2A). As

NO, N2O, and NH4 depending on the pH (Figure 2A; Sum-
mers and Chang, 1993; Hansen et al., 1994, 1996). It has further
been observed that the intercalating anion in the GR mineral

affects the rate of NO

pared with GR intercalated with sulfate (SO

2001). A number of microorganisms produce GR as intermedi-
ates or products of nitrate-dependent iron oxidation (Chaudhuri
et al., 2001; Lack et al., 2002). Therefore, it is possible that abiotic
reactions catalyzed by GR can contribute to nitrate removal in
iron-oxidizing microcosms and cultures during the growth phase,
after growth has stopped, or in non-growth cultures in which GR
has formed.

As the reaction between Fe(II) and NO

A WRENCH IN THE GEARS: EVIDENCE FOR UNCOUPLING OF
BACTERIAL DENITRIFICATION BY Fe(II)
In Escherichia coli, it has been known for some time that the
−
presence of millimolar Fe(II) and NO
3 leads to an uncoupling
of electron transport and dissimilatory nitrate reduction result-
ing in the production of high micromolar to millimolar levels
of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O; Brons et al., 1991;
Figure 2B). Further evidence for uncoupling of nitrate reduction
electron transport by Fe(II) was observed with Shewanella putre-
faciens 200 and Paracoccus denitriﬁcans (Cooper et al., 2003; Coby
and Picardal, 2005). The location and form of Fe(II), the pH, and
the nitrogen oxide starting material are all likely to contribute
to the products of abiotic uncoupling reactions during micro-
bial nitrate and nitrite reduction (Chalamet, 1973; Moraghan and
Buresh, 1977; Hansen et al., 2001).

−
3 is slow, the ﬁrst likely
−
point of uncoupling is Fe(II) oxidation by NO
2 to produce NO
and Fe(III) as initial products (Figure 2B). In previous studies, NO
was found to be produced at a higher rate and accumulate in cul-
tures of heterotrophically grown nitrate reducers in the presence
of Fe(II) (Brons et al., 1991). NO is a gas, and will partition into
the headspace of sealed culture tubes, potentially representing a
signiﬁcant loss of electron accepting equivalents in open systems.
However, NO is also toxic, and can react with metalloproteins in
the cell and components of the electron transport chain, and in
the presence of redox active metals can nitrosate thiols (Beckman
and Koppenol, 1996). Fortunately, the respiratory NO reductase
(Nor) of denitrifying bacteria can reduce NO to less toxic products,
and other enzymes involved in the reduction of nitrogen oxides
can play a protective role in addition to their respiratory function
(Gardner et al., 2002; Gomes et al., 2002; Mills et al., 2008). Nor
is independently regulated from other components of the deni-
triﬁcation pathway and can be upregulated to reduce excess NO
(Rodionov et al., 2005).

Little NO
2 should accumulate in denitrifying cultures as a
−
result of fast abiotic reactions between NO
2 and Fe(II). Contrary
to this prediction, some previous studies have measured nitrite
accumulation and attributed this ﬁnding to the inhibition of nitrite
reductase by Fe(III) precipitation (Straub et al., 1996; Weber et al.,
2006b). However, it should be noted that NO (and other nitrogen
oxides) will rapidly react with O2 to form nitrite (Feelisch, 1991;
Beckman and Koppenol, 1996). If samples are not kept anaerobic

Upregulation of Nor or other NO reductase proteins could protect cells

during sample preparation for nitrite analysis, the nitrite analyzed
may also represent other reactive nitrogen species (Straub et al.,
1996; Weber et al., 2006b). Some researchers have suggested that
−
NO
2 may function as a shuttle to oxidize iron (Miot et al., 2009a;
Chakraborty et al., 2011). We ﬁnd this hypothesis plausible, and
−
have also proposed that abiotic reactions between Fe(II) and NO
2
could lead to an energetic beneﬁt through an electron sparing
mechanism (Figure 1D).

−

Excess NO produced by bacteria can also further react to form
other compounds. NO will bind to free Fe(II) outside of the
cell to form stable iron–nitrosyl complexes (Brons et al., 1991;
Figure 2B), but will not bind tightly to Fe(III). Thus, as Fe(II)
oxidation continues, bound NO will be released. Further reduc-
tion of NO can produce the high energy intermediate nitroxyl
(NO
, HNO) which can react with thiols to form hydroxylamine
(Flores-Santana et al., 2011), or with another nitroxyl to form
N2O (Beckman and Koppenol, 1996; Flores-Santana et al., 2011;
Figure 2B). Some evidence for nitroxyl as an intermediate in den-
itriﬁcation exists (Turk and Hollocher, 1992), and though the
couple is −0.8 V vs. SHE at pH
redox potential of the NO/NO
7 (Bartberger et al., 2002), the evidence for its presence and a
role in other biological systems is increasing. It is possible that a
nitroxyl-like species is an intermediate in biological and chemical
denitriﬁcation pathways (Flores-Santana et al., 2011).

IN A METAL CAGE: Fe(II) DIFFUSION INTO CELLS AND CELL
ENCRUSTATION BY THE FORMATION OF PERIPLASMIC AND
OUTER MEMBRANE IRON OXIDE MINERALS
Iron-oxidizing bacteria produce insoluble Fe(III) minerals as a
product. In some cases, these insoluble minerals have been found
associated with the periplasm of cells or on the cell surface. Pre-
cipitation outside of cell was observed for Rhodobacter capsulatus
SW2 (Kappler and Newman, 2004), and a local drop in pH around
the cells was proposed to be involved in preventing precipitation in
the periplasm (Kappler and Newman, 2004). In contrast, precipi-
tates in the periplasm were observed in the nitrate-dependent iron
oxidizer Acidovorax sp. Strain BoFeN1 (Kappler et al., 2005, 2010;
Miot et al., 2009b). More speciﬁcally, these precipitates appear to
be initially localized to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane
(Miot et al., 2011).

The insolubility of Fe(III) creates a serious problem for iron
oxidizers. If ferric minerals begin to crystallize in the periplasm
or on the surface of cells, damage to membranes, proteins, and
other cellular components will likely ensue, and under extreme
cases, the permeability of the cells to soluble nutrients may be
impaired. If Fe(II) enters the cytoplasm, it can replace other metals
in proteins, and participate in damaging redox reactions (Crich-
ton, 2009). Cellular Fe(II) homeostasis is carefully controlled in
microbes by the activity of metalloregulatory proteins such as

the ferric uptake regulator, Fur (Crichton, 2009). Efﬂux pumps
are widely used by bacteria for the export of toxic metal ions,
and at the expense of ATP, provide a means of exporting metals
from the cell (Nies, 2003). Most studies investigating transcrip-
tional responses of microorganisms to iron have focused on iron
uptake under iron limiting conditions, but environmental con-
ditions certainly exist where a cell is faced with iron overload.
It seems likely that under high iron conditions, efﬂux pumps
would be upregulated (Figure 2C). Consumption of ATP by these
pumps may attenuate any energy gains as a result of Fe(II) oxi-
dation by the organism. Although signiﬁcant research effort has
focused on these efﬂux pumps, most studies have looked at their
expression in the presence of metals other than Fe(II) (Nies,
2003).

It has been suggested that Fe(II) bound to cell surface minerals
can further catalyze denitriﬁcation reactions (Coby and Picardal,
2005), and that these mineral deposits may prevent the diffusion of
soluble electron acceptors into the cell. It appears that some bacte-
ria are able to avoid periplasmic encrustation, but the mechanism
for exporting the Fe(III) before it precipitates is not known. It has
been suggested that a local low pH in the periplasm and outside
of cells could prevent Fe(III) precipitation, and extracellular poly-
saccharide ﬁbers or pili may provide a scaffold for mineralization
outside of the cell (Figure 2D; Miot et al., 2009b).

A BALANCING ACT: HARNESSING ELECTRONS FROM Fe(II)
AND AVOIDING TOXICITY
Electrons from the oxidation of Fe(II) are thermodynamically
−
poised to reduce NO
3 (Koppenol, 1996; Bartberger et al., 2002;
Shaﬁrovich and Lymar, 2002; Dutton et al., 2005; Flores-Santana
et al., 2011), but the kinetics of the abiotic reactions are slow
(Moraghan and Buresh, 1977). Therefore, high rates of nitrate-
dependent Fe(II) oxidation observed in many studies indicate that
Fe(II) is enzymatically coupled to the reduction of nitrate to at
least nitrite. This is further supported by the results of washed

cell suspension experiments where nitrate-dependent oxidation
occurs rapidly with Fe(II) as the sole electron donor (Chaudhuri
et al., 2001; Lack et al., 2002; Weber et al., 2006b). If the reactions
were entirely abiotic, the rate of Fe(II) oxidation should not differ
from the heat-killed controls.

A number of bacteria are capable of growth in the presence
of Fe(II) (Weber et al., 2006a), and in some cases, growth ben-
eﬁt from neutrophilic iron oxidation has been reported (Muehe
et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2009; Chakraborty et al., 2011). It is clear
from these studies that the culture conditions can greatly affect
the growth beneﬁt associated with iron oxidation (Weber et al.,
2009; Chakraborty et al., 2011). What is not clear, however, are
the exact mechanisms whereby diverse species of bacteria harness
Fe(II) electrons in the presence of competing abiotic reactions
with nitrogen oxides.

CONCLUSION
Our central hypothesis is that the mechanisms used by neu-
trophilic anaerobic nitrate-dependent
iron-oxidizing bacteria
likely exist along a continuum from purely abiotic reac-
tions between microbially produced nitrogen oxides to mixed
biotic/abiotic mechanisms involving direct electron donation
from iron to cellular components. This fascinating and geo-
chemically important process may also be unique in that the
microbial metabolisms themselves might take advantage of abi-
−
otic reactions, for example by using NO
2 as a shuttle (Miot et al.,
2009a; Chakraborty et al., 2011), or through the electron sparing
hypothesis in Figure 1D. With the growing number of pure iso-
lates of robust iron oxidizing microorganisms, we are optimistic
that the mechanistic proposals in this paper can be tested in the
laboratory.
