One difﬁculty in using bioremediation at a contaminated site is demonstrating that biodegra-
dation is actually occurring in situ. The stable isotope composition of contaminants may
help with this, since they can serve as an indicator of biological activity.To use this approach
it is necessary to establish how a particular biodegradation pathway affects the isotopic
composition of a contaminant.This study examined bacterial strains expressing three aero-
bic enzymes for their effect on the 13C/12C ratio when degrading both trichloroethene (TCE)
and cis-1,2-dichloroethene (c-DCE): toluene 3-monoxygenase, toluene 4-monooxygenase,
and toluene 2,3-dioxygenase. We found no signiﬁcant differences in fractionation among
the three enzymes for either compound. Aerobic degradation of c-DCE occurred with low
fractionation producing 13δ C enrichment factors of −0.9± 0.5 to −1.2± 0.5, in contrast
−20.4‰. Aerobic
to reported anaerobic degradation 13δ C enrichment factors of −14.1 to
degradation of TCE resulted in δ C enrichment factors of −11.6± 4.1 to −14.7± 3.0‰
which overlap reported 13δ C enrichment factors for anaerobic TCE degradation of −2.5 to
−13.8‰.The data from this study suggest that stable isotopes could serve as a diagnostic
for detecting aerobic biodegradation of TCE by toluene oxygenases at contaminated sites.

INTRODUCTION
Chlorinated ethenes are among the most ubiquitous groundwater
contaminants in the industrialized world. These harmful chemi-
cals not only threaten water supplies, but they can be difﬁcult and
costly to remove from subsurface environments. Because of this,
many remediation operations have implemented bioremediation
strategies that exploit the ability of several groups of microorgan-
isms to degrade these contaminants. The assessment of biodegra-
dation at contaminated ﬁeld sites can be extremely challenging.
For biodegradation of several important pollutants speciﬁc inter-
mediates are known and allow at least a qualitative assessment
of biodegradation as is the case with reductive dechlorination of
chlorinated ethenes (Magar et al., 2001). The quantiﬁcation of
biodegradation is more difﬁcult because of the need for conclu-
sive mass balances which are often problematic due to insufﬁcient
knowledge about the groundwater ﬂow, spatial and temporal het-
erogeneity, the limited number and placement of sampling wells,
and insufﬁcient observation times. Despite these difﬁculties, quan-
titative data are considered important for the protection of public
welfare (National Research Council, 2000).

In planning and implementing biodegradation, it is essential
to estimate the different sinks for organic contaminants such as

dilution, sorption, or biodegradation, because the last of these
is the only process that destroys the contaminant. This is espe-
cially important for monitored natural attenuation, which relies
on natural biodegradation by indigenous microbial communities.
Stable carbon isotopic analysis of dissolved organic contaminants
has the potential not only to identify biotic and abiotic processes,
but also to directly assess the extent of intrinsic biodegradation
of contaminants occurring in the subsurface (Elsner et al., 2005).
Although non-degradative dispersion processes do not fraction-
ate, biodegradation often does, altering the isotopic signature
of the residual contaminant pool (Meckenstock et al., 2004).
This suggests that changes in isotopic values of residual chlo-
rinated ethenes during degradation can be used to document
degradation.

In order to fully utilize δ13C in ﬁeld contaminant degradation
studies, the isotopic enrichment factors (ε) of a particular degrada-
tion mechanism need to be determined. The isotopic enrichment
factor measures the extent of fractionation by employing the
Rayleigh equation (Mariotti et al., 1981). This involves the analysis
of the isotope ratios of the residual, not yet degraded, substrate and
is useful because it relates differences in isotope ratios to changes
in contaminant concentrations.

C13 fractionation by toluene oxygenases

Recently, stable carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) have been intro-
duced as a tool to monitor biodegradation of chlorinated solvents.
There are several laboratory studies that demonstrate carbon iso-
tope fractionation of the remaining contaminant pool during
anaerobic reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene (PCE)
and TCE (Sherwood Lollar et al., 1999; Bloom et al., 2000;
Slater et al., 2001; Cichocka et al., 2007). Additionally, studies
have documented isotope fractionation from anaerobic processes
occurring in situ (Hunkeler et al., 1999, 2004; Sherwood Lollar
et al., 2001; Song et al., 2002; Vieth et al., 2003). Although many
aquifers contain both aerobic and anaerobic regions, little research
has examined the isotope fractionation measured during aerobic
cometabolic degradation of TCE and c-DCE (Barth et al., 2002;
Chu et al., 2004). In anaerobic systems reductive dechlorination of
c-DCE results in about twofold greater fractionation than reduc-
tive dechlorination of TCE. Reported δ13C enrichment factors for
anaerobic c-DCE degradation range from −12 to −20.4‰ (Hun-
keler et al., 1999, 2002; Bloom et al., 2000; Slater et al., 2001). TCE
δ13C enrichment factors range from−2.5 to−18.9‰ in anaerobic
degradation (Hunkeler et al., 1999; Sherwood Lollar et al., 1999;
Bloom et al., 2000; Slater et al., 2001; Cichocka et al., 2007).

Much of the interest in aerobic chlorinated ethene bioreme-
diation has focused on toluene and methane oxygenases. Solu-
ble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and particulate methane
monooxygenase (pMMO) are enzymes that cometabolically oxi-
dize chlorinated ethenes. Chu et al. (2004) found that sMMO from
Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b did not signiﬁcantly fractionate
c-DCE, but it did fractionate TCE with a δ13C enrichment factor
of −1.1‰. This δ13C enrichment factor is lower than the range
reported for anaerobic TCE degradation (minimum of −2.5‰).
We are not aware of any reports of fractionation by pMMO. There
are ﬁve known pathways for the oxidation of toluene which differ
in the location of the initial oxidation (Worsey and Williams, 1975;
Wackett and Gibson, 1988; Shields et al., 1989; Whited and Gibson,
1991; Olsen et al., 1994). Four of these ﬁve pathways cometa-
bolically degrade TCE and other chlorinated ethenes (Hopkins
and McCarty, 1995; Leahy et al., 1996; Ryoo et al., 2000; Shim
et al., 2001). Only one study that we are aware of has investigated
the 13C isotopic fractionation of these pathways when degrad-
ing chlorinated ethenes (Barth et al., 2002). Their study of the
toluene-2-monooxygenase (T2MO) of Burkholderia cepacia G4
indicated a greater fractionation of TCE (ε=−18.2 to −20.7‰)
than has been seen in anaerobic reductive dechlorination of TCE
(maximum of −13.8‰).

The purpose of this study was to determine δ13C enrichment
factors when degrading TCE and c-DCE for bacteria express-
ing particular toluene oxygenase pathways in order to extend the
usefulness of stable carbon isotopic analysis to aerobic sites cont-
aminated with TCE or c-DCE. The toluene oxygenase pathways
studied and the bacterial strains containing them are: toluene
dioxygenase (TDO), Pseudomonas putida F1 and P. ﬂuorescens
CFS215; toluene 3-monooxygenase (T3MO), Ralstonia pickettii
PKO1; toluene 4-monooxygenase (T4MO), P. mendocina KR1. To
our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst to investigate the carbon
isotope fractionation by bacteria expressing these three toluene
oxygenase pathways toward TCE and the ﬁrst to investigate
fractionation of c-DCE by bacteria containing toluene oxygenases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CHEMICALS
All the media components except Noble agar (Difco Laboratories,
Detroit, MI, USA) and (NH4)2SO4 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,
MO, USA) were obtained from Fisher (Fisher Scientiﬁc Co., Fair
Lawn, NJ, USA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma.
All these chemicals were reagent grade.

CELL MAINTENANCE, GROWTH, AND PREPARATION
Pseudomonas putida F1 and P. mendocina KR1 were provided by
D. T. Gibson. P. ﬂuorescens CFS215 and R. pickettii PKO1 were
provided by R. H. Olsen.

The above strains were maintained in a liquid minimal medium
containing (NH4)2SO4 (0.1% w/v), modiﬁed Hutner’s mineral
solution (1% v/v), and 40 mM phosphate (pH 7.3). Hutner’s “con-
centrated base” mineral solution was modiﬁed to exclude nicotinic
acid, thiamine, and biotin (Cohen-Bazire et al., 1957). Toluene was
supplied (100 μL/100 mL medium) once a week and the cultures
were incubated on a shaker at 30˚C.

For each strain there were four experimental treatments which
were: live cells with c-DCE, killed cells with c-DCE, live cells with
TCE, and killed cells with TCE. Five replicates for each strain-
treatment combination were performed. Due to logistical reasons,
the replicates were performed sequentially. To allow for valid com-
parisons between strains, each replicate experiment consisted of
all strain-treatment combinations.

Prior to each replicate for each strain 250 mL of minimal
medium in 500 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks was inoculated with 1 mL of
the stock culture. Two hundred microliters of toluene was added
and the ﬂasks were sealed with screw caps. The cultures were incu-
bated on a shaker at 30˚C for 12 h (strains F1 and CFS215) or 48 h
(strains KR1 and PKO1).

After incubation, nitrogen gas (Airgas, Radnor, PA, USA) was
passed through a 0.1-μm ﬁlter and bubbled through the cultures
for 30 min to remove any remaining toluene. Half (125 mL) of each
culture was then autoclaved to serve as killed controls. The opti-
cal density (A610) of each culture was determined on a Spectronic
Genesys 5 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc). As the optical
density of the cultures were different from each other (between
0.5 and 1.5), the degradation rates were normalized to cell dry
mass. Prior experiments had produced a standard curve for each
strain correlating the optical density with the dry mass of cells per
microliter of culture (data not shown).

For each replicate the four strains each had ﬁve 20 mL serum
vials prepared for each treatment. Ten microliters of culture was
placed in each vial and 70 μL of a 1000-mg/L stock solution of
c-DCE or TCE was added for a ﬁnal concentration of 7 mg/L chlo-
rinated ethene in each vial. Abiotic controls (six each for TCE
and c-DCE) consisting of 10 mL of sterile medium and 70 μL of
the c-DCE or TCE stock were also prepared. Each vial contained
10 mL of headspace consisting of atmospheric air. All the vials
were sealed with Mininert valves (VICI Precision Sampling, Inc.,
Houston, TX, USA). The vials were incubated inverted, shaking at
30˚C in the dark.

At each time point (0, 12, 24, 48, 72 h) one vial from each
strain-treatment combination was removed from the incubator
and 100 μL concentrated HCl was added to each vial with a syringe

to kill the cells. Three abiotic controls of each chlorinated ethene
were injected with the HCl at the start of the replicate and the
remaining three for each chlorinated ethene were injected with
HCl at the end of the replicate (72 h). The vials were stored at 4˚C
in the dark until analyzed, typically within 48 h.

STABLE ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS
Trichloroethene and c-DCE were extracted from each vial using
a headspace equilibration technique (Slater et al., 1999). Sealed
vials were incubated in a forced air drying oven at 60˚C for at least
30 min prior to analysis. After equilibration, 1 mL of headspace
was manually injected into a Thermo Trace GC using a 1-mL SGE
gastight syringe. Samples were analyzed for δ13C on a Thermo-
Finnigan Trace GC interfaced with a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus
isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The GC was equipped with a DB-
624 capillary column. The following GC temperature program was
used: 40˚C for 4 min, increase the temperature to 90˚C at a rate of
15˚C/min, hold at 90˚C for 3 min. The injector temperature was
set at 250˚C with a split ratio of 10:1 and the helium ﬂow was
1.2 mL/min.

Concentration standards of c-DCE and TCE were made daily
in sterilized medium in 20 mL serum vials and sealed with coated
gray butyl septa and crimp-top aluminum caps. The peaks for
c-DCE and TCE were identiﬁed based on retention time in the
GC and concentrations were determined from a calibration curve
generated from known standards using the GC peak areas. Carbon
isotope ratios (δ13C) were calculated by comparing the δ13C value
of c-DCE and TCE to a CO2 reference gas.

Low levels of leakage from the vials were observed for both
c-DCE and TCE in abiotic controls (no-cell controls and killed
cell controls). For each chlorinated ethene the leakage rates were
essentially the same for all control vials. An average leakage rate was
obtained from all the abiotic controls for each chlorinated ethene
(0.004 mg c-DCE/L/h and 0.003 mg TCE/L/h) and was used to
correct the concentrations of c-DCE and TCE in the experimental
vials. The corrections were based on the total time that the samples
were incubated and stored before analysis. No signiﬁcant fraction-
ation was observed over time in the controls due to the leakage so
the δ13C values were not corrected.

A Rayleigh model for closed systems was used to describe the
changes in carbon isotopic ratios during biodegradation in terms
of an isotopic enrichment factor (ε):
δ13Ct + 1000

δ13C0 + 1000

(cid:3) = 1000 ln

ε ln

(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:2)

(cid:2)(cid:2)

(cid:3)(cid:3)

ft

(cid:2)

where ft is the fraction of substrate remaining at time t and δ13Ct
and δ13C0 are the isotopic ratios of the substrate at time t and
time 0 respectively. Assuming that the isotopic enrichment factor
is constant, it can be determined by plotting the right side of the
equation versus ln(ft). The slope of the line obtained is the isotopic
enrichment factor (ε). The enrichment factors from the replicates
for each strain-treatment combination were averaged and a SD
calculated to produce the reported values.

Variation in the data is likely due to some concentration mea-
surements that were close to the detection limit of the instrument
and due to variability between replicates. The space where the
experiments were incubated randomly varied in temperature over

a range of 5˚C. Within a given replicate all four strains and all
treatments experienced the same temperature variations, but for
logistical reasons the replicates were run sequentially and thus each
replicate experienced a different temperature regime.

RESULTS
All of the experimental vials exhibited little or no lag phase before
the onset of degradation (Figure 1). For both contaminants, and
for all four strains, degradation slowed to near zero after 24 h. At
this point the only experiment showing complete degradation was
strain KR1 degrading c-DCE. For the three strains excluding KR1,
c-DCE degradation left a little over a third of the starting concen-
tration on average and for all four strains degrading TCE about two
thirds of the initial concentration remained. Because the degrada-
tion began to slow by 24 h, the degradation rates were calculated
based on the ﬁrst 12 h. Strains F1, CFS215, and PKO1 degraded
c-DCE at similar rates, whereas strain KR1, which expresses the
toluene 4-monooxygenase, degraded c-DCE at a rate 5–9 times
higher than the other strains (Table 1). All strains degraded c-DCE
at a higher rate than TCE.

All four bacterial strains showed enrichment in 13C over time in
the remaining contaminant as both c-DCE and TCE were degraded
(Figure 2). For strain KR1 the degradation of c-DCE occurred so
quickly that there were too few data points to accurately determine
the enrichment in 13C. From these data δ13C enrichment factors
(ε) were calculated using the Rayleigh equation (Table 2). Because
the abiotic and killed cell controls showed no signiﬁcant fraction-
ation the Rayleigh equation was not applied to them (Figure 2).
For the three strains excluding KR1 the δ13C enrichment factors
for c-DCE degradation were not signiﬁcantly different from each
other (Table 2). All four strains had δ13C enrichment factors for
the degradation of TCE that were much greater than seen for the
degradation of c-DCE, and these δ13C enrichment factors were
not signiﬁcantly different from each other.

DISCUSSION
The effects of abiotic processes, such as volatilization and sorption
to solids, on isotopic fractionation have been shown to be negligi-
ble for equilibrium partitioning of chlorinated ethenes (Poulson
and Drever, 1999; Slater et al., 1999, 2000). Barth et al. (2002)
demonstrated that fractionation due to sorption of TCE to bio-
mass of killed B. cepacia G4 cells is less than 0.5‰ (the typical
accuracy and reproducibility of continuous ﬂow isotope analysis
techniques). In line with these previous studies there was no sig-
niﬁcant fractionation during the experiment for TCE or c-DCE in
the killed cell controls (Figure 2). This indicates that sorption to
biomass or other bottle effects had no effect on the isotopic com-
position of the contaminants, and that the observed fractionation
in the experimental vials results from enzymatic degradation and
not from non-degradative processes.

As expected from theoretical predictions and previous observa-
tions (Semprini, 1997; Bradley, 2003), the more reduced molecule
(c-DCE) was degraded (oxidized) faster than TCE for all the tested
bacterial strains. Both TCE and c-DCE degradation rates were
comparable to the low end of the range reported in previous stud-
ies being about 10% of the median degradation rates previously
reported (Semprini, 1997; Arp et al., 2001). The halt in degradation

before completion is likely due to exhaustion of oxygen in the vials
and the fact that no carbon source was present in the vials to pro-
vide reducing equivalents. Toxicity of the contaminants is also a
factor to consider. TCE and c-DCE degradation have been shown
to irreversibly inactivate monooxygenase enzymes as well as being

toxic to cells (van Hylckama Vlieg and Janssen, 2001) so it is rea-
sonable to conclude that such effects may have occurred in the
current study.

Trichloroethene degradation δ13C enrichment factors were not
signiﬁcantly different among the four strains tested. These fac-
tors all fell into the range of −11.6± 4.1 to −14.7± 3.0‰. This
range overlaps the high end of the range of values reported for
anaerobic TCE degradation (Table 3). The other reported toluene
oxygenase pathway from strain G4 had an even higher fractiona-
tion than was observed for the toluene oxygenases in this study.
Although toluene oxygenases tend to exhibit higher fractiona-
tion for TCE degradation than anaerobic degradative enzymes,
the two processes (except for T2MO) cannot be conclusively dis-
tinguished based solely on carbon stable isotope fractionation. All
of the toluene oxygenases examined fractionate TCE much more
strongly than sMMO, the only other reported fractionation for an
aerobic TCE biodegradation pathway. Because these toluene oxy-
genases are all phylogenetically related and are thought to act by the
same mechanism, it is not surprising that their enrichment factors
are similar. Because the variation in our data was relatively high,
it is possible that future reﬁnement in the methods that results in

a lower variability could show small differences in the enrichment
factors of different enzymes.

The three bacterial strains excluding KR1 did not signiﬁ-
cantly differ in fractionation during degradation of c-DCE, with

δ13C enrichment factors falling in the range of −0.9± 0.5 to
−1.2± 0.5‰. The much lower fractionation seen in c-DCE degra-
dation compared to TCE degradation could be linked to the much
faster degradation of c-DCE than TCE. This faster degradation
indicates that the enzyme transforms c-DCE more easily than
TCE which means that the enzyme will be less affected by the
different bond strengths in molecules of c-DCE containing dif-
ferent carbon isotopes than in TCE transformation. As is the case
for TCE degradation, this fractionation is greater than seen dur-
ing degradation by sMMO, the only oxygenase to be tested for
carbon fractionation from degradation of c-DCE (Chu et al.,
2004; Table 3). In contrast to the sMMO and toluene oxyge-
nase data, anaerobic degradation of c-DCE shows a strong carbon
isotope fractionation ranging from −12 to −20.4‰ (Hunkeler
et al., 1999, 2002; Bloom et al., 2000; Slater et al., 2001). Since
the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of c-DCE are different
in their extent of fractionation, these data can be used to dis-
tinguish between the aerobic versus anaerobic degradation at
a contaminated site as was demonstrated in a model wetland

enrichment factors below −9.3‰ and aerobic δ13C enrichment
factors above −13.8‰). Therefore, carbon isotope fractiona-
tion has a somewhat limited utility in distinguishing between
TCE degradation pathways, but it can be used to distinguish
biodegradation of TCE from abiotic dispersion processes in both
types of systems. Although carbon isotope fractionation alone
may not be able to distinguish between various fates of c-DCE
and TCE in the environment, it may prove valuable in conjunc-
tion with chlorine isotope fractionation to differentiate aerobic
from anaerobic degradation as was demonstrated by Abe et al.
(2009).

For bioremediation to be used at a contaminated site it is
necessary to demonstrate that biodegradation is not only possi-
ble, but is actually happening. Stable isotopes are one of the few
techniques available for demonstrating actual degradation. Frac-
tionation during reductive dechlorination has been used as an
indicator of biodegradation at TCE contaminated sites (Sherwood
Lollar et al., 2001; Song et al., 2002; Vieth et al., 2003). Simi-
larly, carbon isotope fractionation could be used as an indicator
of biodegradation by toluene oxygenases at aerobic contaminated
sites.
