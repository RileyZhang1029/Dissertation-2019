To obtain knowledge on how regional variations in methane seepage rates inﬂuence the
stratiﬁcation, abundance, and diversity of anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME), we analyzed
the vertical microbial stratiﬁcation in a gravity core from a methane micro-seeping area at
Nyegga by using 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene tagged amplicons and quantitative
PCR. These data were compared with previously obtained data from the more active G11
pockmark, characterized by higher methane ﬂux. A down core stratiﬁcation and high rela-
tive abundance of ANME were observed in both cores, with transition from an ANME-2a/b
dominated community in low-sulﬁde and low methane horizons to ANME-1 dominance
in horizons near the sulfate-methane transition zone. The stratiﬁcation was over a wider
spatial region and at greater depth in the core with lower methane ﬂux, and the total 16S
rRNA copy numbers were two orders of magnitude lower than in the sediments at G11
pockmark. A ﬁne-scale view into the ANME communities at each location was achieved
through operational taxonomical units (OTU) clustering of ANME-afﬁliated sequences. The
majority of ANME-1 sequences from both sampling sites clustered within one OTU, while
ANME-2a/b sequences were represented in unique OTUs. We suggest that free-living
ANME-1 is the most abundant taxon in Nyegga cold seeps, and also the main consumer of
methane. The observation of speciﬁc ANME-2a/b OTUs at each location could reﬂect that
organisms within this clade are adapted to different geochemical settings, perhaps due to
differences in methane afﬁnity. Given that the ANME-2a/b population could be sustained
in less active seepage areas, this subgroup could be potential seed populations in newly
developed methane-enriched environments.

INTRODUCTION
Anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME) play a vital role in the global
carbon cycle budget, acting as methane sinks in marine systems.
Through anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) they are esti-
mated to consume >90% of the 85–300 Tg CH4 annually pro-
duced, and thereby contribute to a strong reduction of methane
emission to the atmosphere (Knittel and Boetius, 2009). Their
main niche in marine sediments is the sulfate-methane transi-
tion zone (SMTZ) which is formed when methane from subsur-
face reservoirs meets sulfate penetrating from the water column
through advection (Berelson et al., 2005; Treude et al., 2005b; Knit-
tel and Boetius, 2009). The location of the SMTZ ranges from a
few decimeters to several hundred meters below the seaﬂoor, and
is inﬂuenced by the local geological settings such as the depth
of the methane production zone, the ﬂux of methane, and sul-
fate through the sediment column and their consumption rates
(Knittel and Boetius, 2009). Sequences from all the currently
deﬁned ANME clades, ANME-1, ANME-2, and ANME-3, have
been retrieved from SMTZs from areas like the Gulf of Mex-
ico (Lloyd et al., 2006), Skagerrak (Parkes et al., 2007), Haakon
Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV; Niemann et al., 2006) respectively,

and the present understanding is that no speciﬁc ANME clade is
considered characteristic for the SMTZ.

Although the SMTZ is often dominated by members of the
ANME clade, other archaeal taxa besides ANME have been found
to be enriched within the SMTZ. Uncultured Archaea like Marine
Benthic Group B (MBG-B) [also named Deep Sea Archaeal
Group (DSAG)], Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic group (MCG),
and Marine Benthic Group D (MBG-D) are among the most abun-
dant taxa in systems like the Peru margin, Aarhus bay, Benguela
Upwelling System, and Santa Barbara Basin (Sørensen and Teske,
2006; Schafer et al., 2007; Harrison et al., 2009; Webster et al.,
2011). No ANME population was identiﬁed in sediments from
the Peru margin and Cascadian margin in the study by Inagaki
et al. (2006), despite the presence of gas hydrates located close
to the SMTZ (present at 50–110 mbsf and below), while ANME
was found among the low-abundance taxa in the other locations
mentioned above. The highly abundant DSAG in Peru margin
sediments has been suggested to be involved in the consumption
of methane or in sulfate reduction (D’Hondt et al., 2004; Biddle
et al., 2006; Inagaki et al., 2006), although the metabolic capa-
bility of this taxon remains unsolved. Furthermore, the methane

ANME-stratiﬁcation inﬂuenced by methane ﬂux

ﬂuid ﬂux into the SMTZ in Peru margin has been estimated to 1.6–
8.8 mmol/m2 year (Biddle et al., 2006), which is considerably lower
than the ﬂux in ANME-dominated areas like Hydrate Ridge (11–
33× 103 mmol/m2 year; Torres et al., 2002), the Gulf of Mexico
(500–2300 mmol/m2 year; Lloyd et al., 2010), and Eckernförde Bay
(240–690 mmol/m2 year; Treude et al., 2005a). Hence, the micro-
bial community composition and abundance of various archaeal
taxa in marine sediments could be related to the supply of methane
through the system over time, and whether the available methane is
sufﬁcient to sustain an ANME-dominated community over other
uncultured Archaea.

For the G11 pockmark at Nyegga (the southern Vøring Plateau,
offshore Mid-Norway) located at water depth of 730 m the
methane ﬂux rate is estimated to 300–500 mmol/m2 year (Chen
et al., 2010). New high-throughput pyrosequencing technolo-
gies allow a deeper sampling of the ecosystems of interest, and
approaches involving barcodes or unique DNA sequence identi-
ﬁers have been developed for multiplex sequencing (Huber et al.,
2007; Parameswaran et al., 2007; Hamady et al., 2008). The strati-
ﬁcation of microorganisms in sediments from the G11 pockmark
was recently analyzed by using FISH, quantitative PCR, and 16S
rRNA gene amplicon libraries of several subsamples (Roalkvam
et al., 2011). The sediment core was sampled inside the G11 pock-
mark in a pingo structure, which is characterized by an elevated
seaﬂoor due to the local accumulation of gas hydrates below (Hov-
land and Svensen, 2006), where the methane ﬂux is relatively high.
The horizons in the shallower parts of the core [0–3 cm below
seaﬂoor (cmbsf)] were dominated by aerobic methanotrophs
within Gammaproteobacteria, and sulfur oxidizing taxa within
Epsilonproteobacteria. At depths below 4–5 cmbsf, a stratiﬁcation
of ANME clades was observed with transitions between hori-
zons dominated by ANME-2a/b, ANME-1, and ANME-2c with
increasing depth.

Here, we used 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA tagged PCR-
amplicons combined with quantitative PCR to investigate the
stratiﬁcation of the microbial communities in a Nyegga sedi-
ment with a relatively low methane ﬂux 80 mmol/m2 year and
deep SMTZ at 205–255 cmbsf (Chen et al., 2011). Furthermore,
we compare the microbial diversity and dominating ANME phy-
lotypes in sediments with low methane ﬂux with those present in
sediments with higher methane ﬂux from a pingo structure within
the G11 pockmark (Roalkvam et al., 2011). Overall, we demon-
strate that the local ﬂuid ﬂow regimes inﬂuence the abundance
and diversity of microbial populations in cold seep sediments at
Nyegga, and possibly in cold seep sediments in general.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SITE DESCRIPTION AND SAMPLING
The Nyegga area is located on the upper Mid-Norwegian continen-
tal slope, at the northeast ﬂank of the Storegga Slide (Figure 1),
and is characterized by a high density of pockmarks and ﬂuid
seepage structures (Evans et al., 1996; Hustoft et al., 2010; Reiche
et al., 2011). The area has been a ﬁeld for multidisciplinary studies
on gas hydrates, authigenic carbonates, ﬂuid ﬂow, and pore-water
geochemistry the last decade with a special focus on the active
micro-seeping area around pockmarks G11 and CN03 (also called
CNE03; Hovland et al., 2005; Hovland and Svensen, 2006; Mazzini

et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2010; Hustoft et al., 2010; Ivanov et al.,
2010; Plaza-Faverola et al., 2010, 2011; Vaular et al., 2010; Reiche
et al., 2011). Recent 2D/3D seismic and multibeam mapping of the
Nyegga area has revealed an area with a high density of pockmark
structures, many with underlying gas blanking areas extending
down to a pronounced bottom simulating reﬂector (BSR) at 250–
300 m depth below seaﬂoor (mbsf; Bünz et al., 2003; Hustoft et al.,
2007, 2009, 2010; Hjelstuen et al., 2010; Plaza-Faverola et al., 2010;
Reiche et al., 2011). During a cruise with R/V G.O.Sars to the
Nyegga area in August of 2008, the 3 m long gravity core GS08-155-
15GC (referred to as 15GC hereafter) was retrieved from the CN03
(cid:48)
area (64˚45.274
E) at 725 m water depth. The ambi-
ent seawater temperature was measured with CTD to be between
−0.6 and −0.7˚C. After retrieval of 15GC, one half of the core
was immediately sampled for detailed microbial diversity studies
and geochemical measurements while the other half was stored at
4˚C as an archive for non-destructive MST and XRF core scan-
ner studies in laboratories on land. Rhizon samplers were used to
extract pore-water from eight horizons throughout the core; at 24,
57, 89, 129, 171, 244, 258, and 290 cm below seaﬂoor (cmbsf). The
subsamples were preserved in glass vials and kept cool until they
were analyzed according to the approach in Chen et al. (2010) in
order to determine the concentration of dissolved sulfate (SO2−
4 )
and total dissolved hydrogen sulﬁde (ΣH2S). Subsamples for DNA
extraction were aseptically retrieved at 10, 30, 50, 80, 100, 120, 140,
160, 180, 200, 220, 240, 255, 270, and 300 cmbsf (±0.5 cm) by using
sterile 1 mL tip cut plastic syringes before they were snap-frozen
in liquid N2 and stored at −80˚C.

ESTIMATION OF METHANE FLUX
Sulfate gradients may be used to estimate the in situ methane ﬂux
(Borowski et al., 1996). The sulfate diffusive ﬂux is obtained from
the linear zone in the concentration proﬁle, i.e., from the depth
range in which there is no production or consumption. Fick’s
ﬁrst law (Krom and Berner, 1980) was used to calculate the sul-
fate diffusive ﬂux in the core, as described by Chen et al. (2010).
As the consumption of sulfate and methane has the stoichiom-
etry 1:1 during AOM (Boetius et al., 2000), the sulfate diffusive
ﬂux is equivalent to the methane ﬂux. The ﬂux was estimated to
∼80 mmol/m2 year in 15GC, when a core porosity of 63% was
used (Chen et al., 2011).

DNA EXTRACTION AND 16S rRNA GENE AMPLICON LIBRARY
PREPARATION
Total genomic DNA was extracted from ∼0.5 g of sediment from
all subsamples using FastDNA Spin kit for soil (MP Biomedicals),
and was subsequently quantiﬁed by A260/A280 ratio measure-
ments, as described in Roalkvam et al. (2011). The pipeline of
16S rRNA gene amplicon library preparation, sequence ﬁltering,
and taxonomical classiﬁcation of amplicons is described else-
where (Lanzén et al., 2011; Roalkvam et al., 2011). In short, DNA
from seven subsamples in 15GC (10, 30, 80, 120, 180, 240, and
270 cmbsf) was applied in a two step PCR in order to generate a 16S
rRNA gene amplicon library for each horizon where both PCR’s
followed a previously described protocol (Roalkvam et al., 2011).
In order to evaluate the accuracy of the PCR and the sequencing
step, subsample 270 cmbsf from 15GC was analyzed in triplicates.

(cid:48)
using the primers Un787f (5

(cid:48)
et al., 2007) and Un1392r (5
-ACGGGCGGTGWGTRC; modiﬁed
from Lane et al., 1985). The triplicates were pooled, and impuri-
ties were removed using MinElute® PCR puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen).
Puriﬁed amplicons were used as template in a second PCR where
the above mentioned primers were modiﬁed to speciﬁcations in
Lib-L chemistry: the GS FLX Titanium Primer A sequence and
a speciﬁc MID sequence of 10 bp for each sample was included
in forward primer Un787f, while the GS FLX Titanium Primer
B sequence was included in reverse primer Un1392r. The ﬁnal
amplicons were puriﬁed as described above and the concentra-
tion was determined by SYBR-Green quantiﬁcation, as described
in Roalkvam et al. (2011). Prior to the pyrosequencing all samples
were pooled, and a ﬁnal puriﬁcation using Agencourt AMPure
XP (Beckman Coulter genomics) was applied to ensure removal
of all impurities. The GS FLX instrument (Roche) at the Nor-
wegian Sequencing Centre was used with 450 bp chemistry for
454-pyrosequencing of all amplicons. The raw sff-ﬁles of 16S tag-
encoded amplicons from all subsamples in gravity core 15GC from
Nyegga have been submitted to the Sequence Read Archive under
the accession number SRA026733.

QUALITY FILTERING OF 16S AMPLICON SEQUENCES AND TAXONOMIC
CLASSIFICATION
Quality ﬁltering and noise removal of pyrosequencing reads of
amplicons were carried out using AmpliconNoise (Quince et al.,
2011) as described in Roalkvam et al. (2011). In summary,
noise, and errors introduced during PCR and pyrosequencing
are corrected during four steps: ﬁltering, ﬂowgram clustering,
sequence-clustering, and chimera removal. The ﬁltered sequences
were aligned to a reference database prepared from Silva SSURef
release 102 (Lanzén et al., 2011) using blastn (default parameters).
Sequences with a bit-score above 150 were assign to their equiv-
alent taxa in the modiﬁed Silva Taxonomy described above based
on the taxonomy of the best blastn bitscores within a 10% range,
using MEGAN version 3.7 (Huson et al., 2007). Finally, the assign-
ments were exported and weighed according to its cluster’s copy
number.

The amplicon library from 270 cmbsf was made in triplicates
prior to sequencing to test the precision and reproducibility of our
primers and the pipeline for amplicon construction and ﬁltering.
The relative abundance of the taxa listed at all taxonomical levels
was compared between the parallel samples, all showing nearly
the same relative taxa distribution (maximum deviation at any

given taxonomic level was 0.014%). The triplicates were therefore
merged and treated as one subsample, comprising 61268 reads,
due to the low deviation in relative abundance.

OPERATIONAL TAXONOMIC UNIT ASSIGNMENT AND DIVERSITY INDEX
ESTIMATIONS
To compare the microbial communities in GC15 from the CN03
area with those in the more active area within the pingo struc-
tures at G11 pockmark (Roalkvam et al., 2011) on operational
taxonomical units (OTU)-level, the individual 16S rRNA gene
tagged amplicon ﬁles were merged and grouped into OTUs
using the AmpliconNoise software and its incorporated features
(Quince et al., 2011). In AmpliconNoise, a quick pre-clustering
of ﬂow-grams was performed prior to the pair-wise alignment of
sequences using the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm (Needleman
and Wunsch, 1970), followed by a hierarchical maximum linkage
clustering with of 97% sequence identity. In order to assign a taxon
to each cluster, one representative sequence from each OTU was
selected and aligned to the Silva Taxonomy using MEGAN. The
sequences representing each OTU were aligned to the Silva SSURef
release 104 in Arb, and a total of 23 sequences were excluded due
to short length (<220 bp) or chimeras, leaving 3299 sequences.

Diversity indices were calculated by the Shannon–Weaver index
(Weaver and Shannon, 1949) and Rao’s quadrate entropy index
(Rao, 1982) using R (version 2.13.1) with the Vegan package inte-
grated or an in-house R script, respectively. The distance matrix
needed for Rao’s quadrate entropy index was generated using
Phylogeny Inference Package (PHYLIP; Felsenstein, 1989) in Arb
(Version 5.0). Diversity indices, such as the Shannon index, may be
inﬂuenced by sampling size. To compare diversity indices across
pyrosequencing libraries of variable size, all sequence tags from
all samples were ﬁrst clustered into OTUs. Then each library were
randomly subsampled using a subsampling size equal to the sam-
ple size of smallest library (796 reads) and by keeping the original
OTU assignments for each sequence tag. Reported mean values
and standard deviations were calculated from indices calculated
from 1000 subsampling iterations per sample.

QUANTITATIVE PCR
The number of 16S rRNA genes from both Archaea and Bacte-
ria in each subsample of 15GC were enumerated using real-time
quantitative PCR, as described in Roalkvam et al. (2011). In short,
genomic DNA from subsamples was quantiﬁed in duplicates,
where each reaction (20 µl) contained 1× Power SYBR-Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 1 µM of each primer, and 1 ng
template. The 16S rRNA genes of bacterial origin were ampli-

ated using DNA from Escherichia coli, and genomic DNA from
Archaeoglobus fulgidus was used as negative control. Similarly,
archaeal 16S rRNA genes were ampliﬁed using primers Un519f

standard curve and genomic DNA from E. coli was used as nega-
tive control. For each subsample, the mean number of 16S rRNA
gene copies/g sediment and corresponding standard deviation was
used as enumeration of Bacteria or Archaea in the core.

RESULTS
GEOCHEMISTRY
The concentration of dissolved sulfate (SO2−
4 ) and total dissolved
hydrogen sulﬁde (ΣH2S) in pore-water from core 15GC from the
CN03 area was determined. The results show a linear decrease
in the concentration of SO2−
4 with depth, ranging from 27.2 mM
at 24 cmbsf to 2.7 mM at 290 cmbsf, concomitant with a gradual
increase in the concentration of ΣH2S from 1.2 to 6.28 mM for the
same depth interval, respectively (Figure 2). However, the highest
concentration of ΣH2S was measured to 13.38 mM at 244 cmbsf.
The methane ﬂux was estimated to ∼80 mmol/m2 year in 15GC,
based on the linear zone in the sulfate concentration proﬁle. The
SMTZ in 15GC was estimated to be at ∼205–255 cmbsf, which is
supported by the peak at 244 cmbsf in the δ13CDIC measurements
(Chen et al., 2011). Consumption of sulfate is mainly ascribed to
AOM (85%) and oxidation of other organic material (15%; Chen
et al., 2011). A characteristic SMTZ was not observed in 29ROV. In
15GC, the methane concentration in the headspace of pore-water
samples ranged from 0.012 to 0.38 mmol/L in horizons above the
SMTZ, and gradually increased values from 0.16 to 3.6 mmol/L
between 243 and 290 cmbsf (Vaular, 2011).

The 15GC core consists of silt and clay rich sediments with a
high bulk density (1.9–2.3 g/cm3) and low porosity, presented as
fractional porosity (∼25–45%), and a low permeability (Figure 2).
The sediment interval starting at 80–90 cmbsf and ending at
∼230–240 cmbsf, within the present SMTZ, is pierced by piping
structures and chemosynthetic shells and shell fragments, indicat-
ing that the core site has been an active methane seeping area at
earlier stage. The high variability in the carbonate content, rep-
resented by the XRF analysis on the Ca element, shows that that
episodic activity of biogenic production is also found in more
recent times, at a depth of ∼30 cm (Figure 2).

QUANTITATIVE PCR
Both Bacteria and Archaea in 15GC were enumerated as 16S
rRNA gene copies/g sediment using quantitative PCR. The rel-
ative abundance of 16S rRNA gene copies/g sediment throughout
the core was 2.05× 106–1.06× 107 for Bacteria and 5.76× 106–
5.75× 107 for Archaea (Figure 2). At all depths Archaea domi-
nated over Bacteria, accounting for 51.7–93.3% of all 16S rRNA
gene copies. The number of 16S rRNA gene copies of archaeal ori-
gin increased toward the SMTZ and decreased below this zone. In
comparison, bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies dominated 29ROV
in the horizons from the sediment surface to 7–8 cmbsf, rang-
ing between 6.72× 106 and 9.1× 108 16S rRNA gene copies/g
sediment (Roalkvam et al., 2011). The bacterial population in
15GC was thus between two and three orders of magnitude lower
than in 29ROV, except for the deepest horizon in 29ROV where
the bacterial population decreased rapidly. Finally, the increase in
the archaeal population with increasing depths was one order of
magnitude for 15GC and three orders of magnitude for 29ROV.

TAXONOMY
The application of pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene tagged PCR-
amplicons to obtain detailed knowledge on the community struc-
ture has recently been proven efﬁcient in studying stratiﬁcation
of microorganisms in sediment cores at a much higher resolu-
tion than has been done previously (Lanzén et al., 2011; Roalkvam
et al., 2011). This approach was used to examine the community
structure in 15GC, from seven depth horizons (10, 30, 80, 120,
180, 240, and 270 cmbsf) were analyzed by 454-pyrosequencing
yielding 3344-26491 reads, whereof 16.4–29.0% were removed
due to poor quality or chimeric sequences. The remaining num-
ber of reads in the dataset were between 2388 and 21400 for 15GC
subsamples (Table 1).

Taxonomic classiﬁcation revealed a high abundance of taxa
that are deﬁciently described below phylum and class level, such
as uncultivated taxa within Marine group 1 (MG-1; Thaumar-
chaeota); Thermoplasmata and MBG-B/DSAG (Crenarchaeota);

lower taxonomic levels decreased, where up to 88.6 and 89.8%
of the community remained unclassiﬁed at order or family level,
respectively. Therefore, only reads binned at phylum and class
level, in addition to selected groups within Methanomicrobia
(Euryarchaeota), were used further in this work.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY IN AMPLICON LIBRARY AND ABUNDANCE
Most of the detected bacterial taxa were found in the shal-
lower horizons, including phyla such as Proteobacteria, Plancto-
mycetes, Deinococcus-Thermus, and the Candidate division OP8,
all decreasing in abundance to less than 1% below horizons at
80–120 cmbsf (Figure 3A). Similarly, the abundance of the phy-
lum Chloroﬂexi decreased rapidly in horizons below 80 cmbsf,
although comprising up to 2% in some of these horizons. The
Bacteria was dominated by the Candidate division JS-1, which was
present throughout the sediments with the highest abundance at
10 and 30 cmbsf accounting for 13.2 and 28% of the total num-
ber of reads, respectively. In each sediment horizon, uncultivated
lineages of Archaea dominated, congruent with the quantitative
PCR-data (Figure 2). Low-abundance archaeal taxa, such as MCG
(1.1–1.8%) and Group C3 (group 1.2; 1.2–2.6%) within Cre-
narchaeota and Thermoplasmata (0.3–4.2%) and Archaeoglobi
(1.2%) within Euryarchaeota were mainly present in horizons
between 10 and 80 cmbsf. Different depth proﬁles of the most
abundant taxa MG-1, DSAG, and Methanomicrobia were observed
(Figure 3A). The shallower horizons (10–120 cmbsf) above the
SMTZ had high abundance of MG-1, ranging between 15.2

and 61.4%, which rapidly decreased toward the SMTZ (5.2% at
180 cmbsf and further to <1% in deeper parts of the core). The
DSAG did not reach as high relative abundance as the MG-1, but
represented a high share of the microbial community above and
within the SMTZ, comprising between 16.2 and 29.2% in hori-
zons at 10–240 cmbsf, except at 270 cmbsf where the abundance
was reduced to 3.9% (Figure 3A). In the deeper horizons (180–
270 cmbsf), where methane concentrations up to 3.6 mmol/L has
been detected in the pore-water (Vaular, 2011), ANME clades
afﬁliated with Methanomicrobia were increasingly dominant. A
similar stratiﬁcation of dominating ANME clades with increas-
ing depth as in 29ROV was observed with a transition from an
ANME-2a/b dominated community to an ANME-1 dominated
community. However, the stratiﬁcation was over wider sediment
depths in 15GC ranging from 120 to 270 cmbsf in comparison
to 4–22 cmbsf in 29ROV. The highest abundance of the ANME-
2a/b clade was found at 120 and 180 cmbsf, with 16.9 and 33.3%
of the total reads respectively (Figure 3B), and hence compris-
ing a similar share of the community as in 29ROV (Roalkvam
et al., 2011). The abundance of ANME-2a/b decreased gradually
to <1% with increasing depth, while ANME-1 increased from 11.1

to 47.9% between 180 and 240 cmbsf. A further increase to 82.2%
at 270 cmbsf was observed, which was the highest abundance of
ANME-1 in 15GC (Figure 3B). The highest relative abundance of
ANME-1 in 15GC (47.9–82.2%) corresponded to the abundance
of ANME-1 in 29ROV (64–89%; Roalkvam et al., 2011). However,
the abundance of ANME-2c increased to a maximum of 60% at
20–22 cmbsf in 29ROV (Roalkvam et al., 2011), which is consid-
erable higher than the maximum value of 5.7% at 270 cmbsf in
15GC.

DIVERSITY INDICES AND OTU DISTRIBUTION
Shannon–Weaver index and Rao’s quadrate entropy index were
used to evaluate and compare the microbial diversity of the
communities in CN03 with those in the G11 pockmark, based
on all reads in the amplicon libraries from 15GC and 29ROV. The
main difference between the indices used is that Rao’s quadrate
entropy index includes the distance between OTUs in addition to
the abundance of sequences. A total of 3322 OTUs were obtained
from 29ROV and 15GC combined, based on 193363 16S rRNA
gene sequences from amplicon libraries. This approach revealed a
vertical variation in microbial diversity in both cores, where a trend
of decreasing diversity with increasing depth was observed regard-
less of the index used (Figure 4). For core 15GC, the diversity was
decreasing gradually with depth, except at 120 cmbsf where the
trend was interrupted by the particularly low diversity estimate.
The core 29ROV had a different diversity proﬁle, with a gradual
decrease in the upper part of the core, followed by a consider-
able decline in the deeper part (Figure 4). The lowest diversity
was found at 270 cmbsf in 15GC and 14–16 cmbsf in 29ROV,
which corresponds to the horizon in each core with the highest
abundance of ANME-1.

Sequences from 29ROV were clustered into 2370 OTUs (1908
unique OTUs) and 15GC were assigned to 1414 OTUs (952 unique
OTUs sampling site) (Table 2), where only 462 OTUs were shared
between the sampling sites. The majority of the taxa from both
cores were clustered into several OTUs, where at least one OTU
was common. Predominating taxa within each core were present in
common OTUs, however some low-abundant taxa within Archaea
[such as Marine Benthic Group A, Archaeoglobaceae, Thermococ-
cales, South African Goldmine Euryarchaeotal Group (SAGMEG),
and Marine Group II within Thermoplasmata] and Bacteria (such
as Candidate division OP11, Chlorobiale, Thermotogales, and taxa
within Bacteroidetes, Chloroﬂexi, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria)
were only present in OTUs that were unique for one of the cores.
The uncultured ANME clade, with sequences afﬁliated with the
ANME-1, ANME-2a/b, and ANME-2c subgroups, were the most
dominating taxa in both 15GC and 29ROV. To study the distri-
bution of ANME at the two sampling sites in more detail, the
OTUs assigned to all ANME subgroups were extracted from the
dataset. A total of 65180 reads from 15GC and 30273 reads from
29ROV grouped into 34 OTUs. Of these, 19 OTUs were excluded
as they were based on single sequences. Hence, 14 and 7 sequences
were removed from the 15GC and 29ROV dataset, respectively.
The remaining 15 OTUs had the following distribution among the
ANME clades: ANME-1 (4), ANME-2a/b (6), and ANME-2c (5).
In horizons dominated by ANME, meaning horizons below
4–5 cm for 29ROV and 120 cm for 15GC, the majority of

standard deviation for subsamples within 15GC and 29ROV were calculated
to be 0.041–0.068 and 0–0.078 for the Shannon–Weaver index,
respectively, and between 3.04–8.67× 10−3 and 0–9.05× 10−3 for the Rao’s
quadrate entropy index, respectively. All standard deviation bars are smaller

the sequences assigned to ANME-1 were present in one OTU
(OTU_542; Figure 5), comprising 80.0–98.5% of the reads in
29ROV and 72.8–100% in 15GC (Table S1 in Supplementary
Material). The remaining ANME-1 sequences were present in
two additional OTUs, which also included sequences from the
shallow horizons above the ANME-dominated zone in both
cores. The ANME-2a/b afﬁliated sequences were mainly dis-
tributed in two dominating OTUs (Figure 5), one speciﬁc
OTU for each core. OTU_442 comprised between 78.6 and
99.9% of ANME-2a/b sequences in 15GC, while OTU_50 con-
stituted 54.5–95.2% of the sequences in 29ROV (0–10 cmbsf).
Furthermore, some ANME-2a/b sequences from the ANME-1
dominated horizons in 29ROV were also assigned OTU_442.

Although the abundance of ANME-2c was considerably higher
in 29ROV than 15GC, the majority of the reads were clus-
tered into two common OTUs (OTU_168 and OTU_1280;
Figure 5). In addition, a substantial number of reads from
29ROV were assigned to OTU_1800, which was unique for
this core.

DISCUSSION
METHANE FLUX AND STRATIFICATION OF METHANOTROPHS
The Nyegga area is characterized by numerous pockmarks and
methane seepage structures in different developmental stages indi-
cating a dynamic, temporal, and spatial system where different
geochemical settings may inﬂuence the microbial community
structure. In this study, 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene
tagged amplicons were used to compare the microbial stratiﬁca-
tion in a gravity core (15GC) from the less active CN03 area with
that in a push core (29ROV) from the active seepage structure
G11 pockmark. The CN03 area is characterized by micro-seepage
of methane, few pockmarks, a SMTZ located at ∼200–250 cmbsf
and a BSR at 250–300 mbsf. The G11 pockmark in comparison, is
characterized by shallow gas hydrates and SMTZ, authigenic car-
bonates, and pingo structures within the pockmark. The higher
methane ﬂux sustains macro-fauna and bacterial mats (Hovland
and Svensen, 2006; Chen et al., 2010; Ivanov et al., 2010). The
methane ﬂuid ﬂux was ∼80 mmol/m2 year for 15GC and 300–
540 mmol/m2 year for 29ROV (Chen et al., 2010). The methane
ﬂux in the CN03 area is within the same range as other seep areas
where ANME have been found to be abundant, such as the Santa
Barbara Basin (164–200 mmol/m2 year; Harrison et al., 2009) and
Gulf of Mexico (20–200 mmol/m2 year; Cofﬁn et al., 2008; Lloyd
et al., 2010). In 29ROV, the ﬂux is apparently so high that methane
reaches the sediment surface where it stimulates a dominance of
aerobic methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria (Roalkvam et al.,
2011). In 15GC, aerobic methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria
were not identiﬁed, indicating that the methane seeping through
the sediments were consumed by ANME which were increas-
ingly dominating the amplicon libraries from 120 cmbsf and
below (Figure 3). A dominance of ANME in deeper horizons
was also observed in 29ROV, however, the ANME-dominated sed-
iment horizons extended over a wider depth interval in 15GC.
Furthermore, similar relative abundances and equivalent transi-
tions between ANME-2a/b and ANME-1 with increasing depth
(Figure 3B) were observed in both 29ROV and 15GC cores. How-
ever, the proportion of ANME-2c seemed to differ between the
cores as 60% of all reads were assigned to ANME-2c in 29ROV,

whereas only 5.7% of all reads were assigned to this taxonomic
group in 15GC. It is possible that the observed difference in
ANME-2c abundances is an effect of the much wider methane
gradient in 15GC and that ANME-2c at this sampling site are fond
in higher numbers in horizons deeper than 270 cmbsf, and thus
not detected in our study.

The methane ﬂux seems to have little effect on the stratiﬁca-
tion of the ANME groups 2a/b, 1, and 2c in the Nyegga ﬁeld,
as a similar stratiﬁcation of these clades was found in both the
29ROV (Roalkvam et al., 2011) and 15GC locations (Figure 3B).
This suggests that shifts in ANME clades through the cores are
determined by other factors than methane availability. Moreover,
both cores are dominated by the same OTUs of ANME-1 and
ANME-2c, indicating that organisms potentially adapted to dif-
ferent methane ﬂuxes cannot be distinguished on the OTU level
within these clades. On the other hand, differences in methane
ﬂux may partly explain why different OTUs of ANME-2a/b dom-
inate in the cores. The methane ﬂux seems to largely inﬂuence the
speciﬁc density of ANME in the cores as the number of archaeal
16S rRNA genes per gram of sediment in the ANME-dominated
horizons was observed to be two orders of magnitude lower in
15GC (Figure 2) than in 29ROV (Roalkvam et al., 2011). This is
congruent with previous studies of sediments with variations in
methane ﬂux and depth of the SMTZ where ANME comprise up
to 3× 109 cells/cm3 sediment in marine sediments with shallow
gas hydrates, such as Gulf of Mexico (Orcutt et al., 2008), Hydrate
Ridge (Knittel et al., 2005), and Eckernförde Bay (Treude et al.,
2005a), whereas in low methane seepage areas with deeper gas
hydrates, such as Santa Barbara and Peru Margin, ANME are rare
or absent (Biddle et al., 2006; Inagaki et al., 2006; Harrison et al.,
2009).

Both in the sediments from the G11 pockmark and in 15GC,
ANME-2a/b was found to dominate in horizons with lower con-
centrations of sulﬁde compared to the ANME-1 dominated hori-
zons. These results are in accordance with previous studies suggest-
ing that ANME-2 is sensitive to H2S produced during AOM with
sulfate (Meulepas et al., 2009a,b). Furthermore, the abundance
of ANME-2a/b was found to be negatively correlated with high
methane and sulﬁde concentrations in Guaymas Basin sediments,
whereas an opposite correlation was found for ANME-1 (Biddle
et al., 2011). Also, a zonation of ANME-2 communities in areas
with efﬁcient H2S removal and ANME-1 in zones with higher con-
centrations of H2S was observed in multilayered microbial mats in
the Black Sea (Krüger et al., 2008). Due to the higher methane ﬂux
in G11 the ANME-2a/b population is exposed to methane-rich
ﬂuids whereas in CN03, the dominating ANME-2a/b is found in
horizons with low methane concentrations of 0.035–0.13 mmol/L.
However, the piping structures and shell fragments in these hori-
zons shows that the methane concentration has probably been
higher in earlier times, indicating that the ANME-2a/b population
could have been established in a methane-enriched environment
in the past and that the ANME-2a/b population present in 15GC
now is sustained by lower methane concentrations. Given the
ability to survive in methane depleted environments, ANME-
2a/b could be the seed population in new methane-enriched
systems, as suggested by Knittel and Boetius (2009). Thus, in
order to fully understand the stratiﬁcation and dynamics of ANME

in the microbial community structures might be needed.

SYNTROPHIC PARTNERS OF ANME
The AOM with sulfate has in previous studies been shown
to be performed by ANME in syntrophy with sulfate-reducing
Deltaproteobacteria, where ANME-1 and ANME-2 are mainly

associated with sulfate-reducers within Desulfosarcina and Desul-
fococcus (DSS; Knittel et al., 2005; Schreiber et al., 2010), while
ANME-3 are associated with sulfate-reducers within Desulfob-
ulbus (DBB; Niemann et al., 2006; Lösekann et al., 2007). The
share of Deltaproteobacteria in horizons with the highest rel-
ative abundance of ANME-2a/b was ranging between 9.0 and
9.1% in 29ROV (Roalkvam et al., 2011), but was below 0.7% in

ANME-stratiﬁcation inﬂuenced by methane ﬂux

15GC (Figure 3A) of which most sequences were assigned to a
clade that is not assumed to be a syntrophic partner of ANME
(Table S1 in Supplementary Material). From the low-abundance
of detected Deltaproteobacteria, it was not obvious to us which of
the detected organisms that acted as a sulfate-reducing syntrophic
partner for ANME-2a/b, at least not in 15GC. One possibility is
that the abundance of Deltaproteobacteria is underestimated due
to bias in the PCR ampliﬁcation of 16S rRNA genes. Another pos-
sibility is that other organisms than Deltaproteobacteria act as the
sulfate-reducing syntrophic partner for the ANME-2a/b detected
in the Nyegga ﬁeld. JS-1 was present in all ANME-2 dominated
horizons in 15GC, but was even more dominating in other sed-
iment horizons, indicating no obligate relationship with ANME.
The JS-1 group is ubiquitous in marine sediments, at depths rang-
ing from <10 to >200 mbsf (Rochelle et al., 1994; Inagaki et al.,
2006; Parkes et al., 2007; Webster et al., 2007). Inagaki et al. (2006)
hypothesized that JS-1 could be adapted to anaerobic conditions in
organic-rich sediments associated with methane hydrates, which
is similar to the environment at Nyegga. Further indications of
JS-1 being a heterotrophic sulfate-reducing bacterium are based
on enrichment cultures where sulfate was depleted in wells with
acetate (Webster et al., 2011). In 29ROV, the abundance of JS-1
throughout the core was correlated to the abundance of ANME-2
(Roalkvam et al., 2011), and ANME-2 may beneﬁt from the activity
of JS-1 by transfer of reducing equivalents derived though AOM
to JS-1. Although, detailed knowledge on the energy metabolism
of JS-1 is needed to assess any syntrophic relationship between
ANME-2 and JS-1. However, our results might imply that ANME-
2a/b can be adapted to perform AOM with Deltaproteobacteria
as a sulfate-reducing partner in systems with high methane con-
centrations (Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001; Knittel et al.,
2005), such as 29ROV. Finally, it should be kept in mind that
ANME-2a/b possibly live in syntrophy with organisms reducing
other electron acceptors than sulfate. Previous work, has demon-
strated that also Fe, Mn, or NO2−
3 may be used as electron acceptors
in AOM (Raghoebarsing et al., 2006; Ettwig et al., 2008; Beal et al.,
2009) which will provide a higher energy yield than the use of
sulfate (Boetius et al., 2000; Nauhaus et al., 2002; Caldwell et al.,
2008). Linking AOM either in syntrophy or by a free-living lifestyle
to such electron acceptor may thus sustain a life in low methane
concentrations. However, it has been argued that the key enzyme
Methyl-CoM reductase in the reverse methanogenesis pathway
will not catalyze the reduction of Fe and Mn due to the inactiva-
tion of the enzyme caused by the highly positive redox-potential
for these electron acceptors (Shima and Thauer, 2005; Thauer and
Shima, 2008).

Recently, the in situ metabolism of the free-living ANME-
1 enriched horizon in 29ROV was studied by using a coupled
metagenomic and metaproteomic approach (Stokke et al., 2012).
All enzymes in the reverse methanogenesis pathway (except N 5,
N 10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin reductase) and corre-
sponding electron accepting complexes were found expressed by
ANME-1. Furthermore, the key enzymes for dissimilatory sul-
fate reduction were found to be expressed in the environment
by Deltaproteobacteria, and in addition, an APS-reductase afﬁl-
iated with previously unknown ANME-partners was identiﬁed.
From this we deduce the hypothesis that AOM is performed by the

ANME-1 population in G11 and CN03, independent of a closely
associated sulfate-reducing partner.

COMMUNITY STRUCTURES IN SHALLOW SEDIMENT HORIZONS
The total organic carbon (TOC) content in Nyegga sediments
is 0.55–0.74% in G11 pockmark and 0.40–0.54% at CN03 area
(Ivanov et al., 2010), which corresponds well with the average
TOC values (∼0.5–1%) for the region (Hölemann and Henrich,
1994). In sedimentary environments, the organic matter buried
over geological timescales is utilized as an energy source by organ-
otrophs (Kujawinski, 2011; Orcutt et al., 2011). Through microbial
remineralization, degradation products are formed which can be
utilized by diverse heterotrophic taxa. The microbial distribu-
tion in 15GC showed a high abundance of taxa that generally
occurs in high numbers in marine sediments, such as Plancto-
mycetes, Chloroﬂexi, Bacteroidetes, JS-1, MBG-B/DSAG, MG-1,
MCG, and MBG-D (Figure 3A; Reed et al., 2002; Inagaki et al.,
2006; Harrison et al., 2009; Blazejak and Schippers, 2010). In 15GC,
Archaea outnumbered Bacteria in all horizons (Figure 2) with a
clear stratiﬁcation of the archaeal phyla (Figure 3A). The MG-1
predominated in horizons probably depleted in oxygen at 10–
120 cmbsf. Cultivated representatives of MG-1 have been shown
to perform aerobic ammonium oxidation (Hallam et al., 2006;
Nicol and Schleper, 2006; Walker et al., 2010). Ammonium, poten-
tially derived from the degradation of nitrogen-containing organic
matter, could support the population of MG-1 in 15GC and may
possibly be oxidized anaerobically. The MG-1 is a diverse clade
with several subgroups that are not well characterized (Durbin and
Teske, 2010), and the MG-1 could possibility have a wider range
of useful metabolisms in this environment. Within the Archaea,
the DSAG is predominant in several marine environments, such
as deep sea sediments (Vetriani et al., 1999; Fry et al., 2008; Wang
et al., 2010), sediments overlaying shallow gas hydrates (Inagaki
et al., 2006) and within the SMTZ at Santa Barbara Basin (Harri-
son et al., 2009) and Peru Margin (Sørensen and Teske, 2006). In
15GC, DSAG was uniformly distributed in horizons between 10
and 240 cmbsf where the concentration of methane is low, but was
outcompeted by ANME-1 at 270 cmbsf where the concentration
of methane is higher. Hence, DSAG may rather perform organ-
otrophic sulfate reduction as suggested by Biddle et al. (2006) and
Inagaki et al. (2006) than consumption of methane in 15GC. This
is also supported by the low-abundance of DSAG in 29ROV, where
the horizons are exposed to methane-rich ﬂuids.

The higher methane ﬂux in the G11 pockmark apparently also
inﬂuenced the absolute numbers of microorganisms, with two
to three orders of magnitude higher number of 16S rRNA gene
copies per gram of sediment compared to the CN03 area. Hence,
even though taxa such as Planctomycetes, Chloroﬂexi JS-1, MG-1,
and DSAG were present with abundances between <1 and 10% in
29ROV, their absolute numbers are in the same order of magni-
tude as in the 15GC core as the total cell number in these horizons
were two to three order of magnitudes higher than in the 15GC.
This indicates that both sampling sites have equivalent amounts
of microorganisms potentially involved in degradation of organic
matter, which is consistent with the relatively even distribution
of organic matter in Nyegga sediments (Hölemann and Henrich,
1994; Ivanov et al., 2010).

ANME-stratiﬁcation inﬂuenced by methane ﬂux

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our results show that ANME dominate in Nyegga
cold seeps, both in the micro-seeping CN03 area and the highly
active G11 pockmark. An equivalent stratiﬁcation of ANME clades
was observed at both sampling sites, indicating that the vertical
distribution of ANME is inﬂuenced by increasing sulﬁde concen-
tration in the sediments or other factors rather than the methane
ﬂuid ﬂux. Furthermore, a ﬁne-scale view into the ANME commu-
nities at each location was achieved through OTU clustering of
ANME-afﬁliated sequences from the amplicon libraries, revealing
a common OTU of ANME-1, and unique OTUs of ANME-2a/b
at the sampling sites. Based on our results we suggest that free-
living ANME-1 is the most abundant taxon, and also the main
consumer of methane in Nyegga cold seeps which can reduce the
methane emission to the atmosphere from sources within the sed-
iments. The speciﬁc ANME-2a/b OTUs could reﬂect adaptations
to the geochemical composition at each location, with different
afﬁnities to methane. The ability to survive in marine systems
depleted in methane could also be advantageous for potential seed
populations.
