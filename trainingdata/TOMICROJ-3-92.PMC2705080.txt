Abstract:  Granulysin  is  a  cationic  protein  produced  by  human  T  cells  and  natural  killer  cells  that  can  kill  bacterial  
pathogens  through  disruption  of  microbial  membrane  integrity.  Herein  we  demonstrate  antimicrobial  activity  of  the  
granulysin  peptide  derived  from  the  active  site  against  Bacillus  anthracis,  Yersinia  pestis,  Francisella  tularensis,  and 
Burkholderia mallei, and show pathogen-specific differences in granulysin peptide effects. The susceptibility of Y. pestis 
to granulysin is temperature dependent, being less susceptible when grown at the flea arthropod vector temperature (26°C) 
than  when  grown  at  human  body  temperature.  These  studies  suggest  that  augmentation  of  granulysin  expression  by  
cytotoxic lymphocytes, or therapeutic application of granulysin peptides, could constitute important strategies for protec-
tion against select agent bacterial pathogens. Investigations of the microbial surface molecules that determine susceptibil-
ity to granulysin may identify important mechanisms that contribute to pathogenesis.

to  human  health.  Among 

  Bacteria  that  evade  the  host  immune  response  by  
surviving  phagocytosis  comprise  some  of  the  most  serious 
these  are  
microbial 
the  
Mycobacterium 
pathogens  classified  by  the  Center  for  Disease  Control  and 
Prevention  as  bacterial  select  agents,  Bacillus  anthracis, 
Yersinia  pestis,  Burkholderia  mallei,  and  Francisella  
tularensis.  The  tropism  for  phagocytic  cells  by  these  patho-
gens is an important factor for their successful evasion of the 
immune  system  and  poses  significant  challenges  for  immu-
nization  or  therapeutic  intervention.  Characterizing  protec-
tive  immune  responses  to  these  pathogens,  then,  is  para-
mount  to  development  of  prophylactic  or  early  therapeutic 
intervention  strategies.  Cytotoxic  T  cells  (Tc)  and  NK  cells 
control  intracellular  pathogens  through  multiple  killing 
mechanisms,  including  death  receptor  activation  and  release 
of  cytolytic  granule  proteins.  In  human  cytotoxic  lympho-
cytes,  granulysin  is  an  important  component  of  the  lytic  
repertoire  and  is  stored  in  cytotoxic  granules  along  with  
perforin  and  granzymes  [1-5]  .  Perforin  and  granzymes  kill 
the infected cell, whereas granulysin has the unique capacity 
to  kill  the  intracellular  pathogen  by  disruption  of  microbial 
membranes  [5-7].  The  lytic  activity  due  to  granulysin  
has  been  described  against  several  important  pathogens,  
including  Mtb,  Plasmodium 
falciparum,  Cryptococcus  
neoformans,  Salmonella  enterica  serovar  Typhimurium  
(S.  Typhimurium),  Escherichia  coli  0157:H7  and  Staphylo-
coccus aureus [5-10] .

  The ability of granulysin to kill intracellular Mtb supports 
an important role for this molecule  in the cytotoxic lympho-
cyte  (Tc  and  NK  cells)  response  to  intracellular  bacterial 
pathogens that evade the immune response through residence 
in  macrophages.  To  investigate  a  potential  role  for  granu-
lysin in the immune repsonse to an expanded list of intracel-
lular bacterial pathogens for which interventions are urgently 
needed, we utilized  a peptide derived from  the  active site of 
human granulysin and a negative control peptide. The active 
site  peptide  has  been  previously  shown  to  reproduce  the  
effects  of  the  recombinant  granulysin  molecule,  and  is  
considered  to  have  potential  as  an  antibacterial  therapeutic 
[5-7,  10,  11].  In  this  study,  we  demonstrate  and  compare  
the  antibacterial  activity  of  granulysin  against  B.  anthracis 
(Ames), Y. pestis (CO 92), F. tularensis (SHU S4 and LVS), 
and  B.  mallei  (ATCC  23344),  using  a  peptide  derived  
from  the  active  site  of  granulysin.  These  studies  support  
the  need  to  further  characterize  the  role  of  granulysin  in  
the  innate  and  acquired  CTL  response  to  these  important 
pathogens.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 
Synthetic  custom  peptides  >95%  pure  by  HPLC  
were  purchased  from  New  England  Peptide  LLC  (Gardner, 
MA, USA).  A peptide  corresponding  to amino acid residues 
34-55  of  human  granulysin  (CRTGRSRWRDVCRNFMRR- 
YQSR)  was  synthesized.  As  a  negative  control,  a  peptide 
corresponding  to  amino  acids  2-22  (RDYRTCLTIVQKL- 
KKMVDKPT)  of  human  granulysin  was  also  synthesized. 
Lyophilized  peptide  was  stored  in  desiccant  at  -20  °C  prior 
to  use.  Peptide  stocks  (5  mM)  were  solubilized  in  0.1  N  
acetic acid solution, and then further diluted in sterile PBS to  
1 mM, prior  to use. Polypropylene  tubes were used to  store,

aliquot, or perform experiments with peptides to prevent loss 
of peptides due to binding to tubes. All experimentation with 
select  agents  was  performed  under  level  2  or  3  biosafety 
conditions according to protocols approved by the University 
of  Texas  Medical  Branch  Environmental  Health  and  Safety. 
S.  Typhimurium,  F.  tularensis,  B.  anthracis  and  B.  mallei 
were  grown  in  brain  heart  infusion  broth  (BHI),  Muller  
Hinton media with Isovitle X, Luria-Bertani (LB) media, and 
LB  media  supplemented  with  4%  glucose  (LBG),  respec-
tively.  Cultures  of  S.  Typhimurium,  F.  tularensis  (LVS, 
SHU  S4),  B.  anthracis  (Ames  strain)  and  B.  mallei  (ATCC 
23344)  were  grown  to  exponential  phase  and  diluted  in 
growth  medium  to  approximately  105  colony  forming  units 
(CFU)/ml.  A  90  μl  aliquot  of  diluted  microorganism  was 
pre-incubated  with  10  μl  of  PBS  or  10  μl  of  individual 
granulysin  peptides  serially  diluted  in  PBS  to  final  concen-
trations  of  1,  10,  and  100  μM.  After  3  hours  of  incubation  
at  room  temperature,  100  μl  aliquots  of  S.  Typhimurium,  
F.  tularensis,  and B. mallei were plated on LB or LBG agar 
plates,  and  100  μl  aliquots  of  peptide  and  B.  anthracis  was 
plated  on  trypticase  soy  agar  with  5%  sheep  blood.  CFU’s 
were  counted  after  overnight  incubation  (48h  for  B.  mallei) 
at  37°C.  Exponential  growth  phase  cultures  of  Y.  pestis 
CO92  or  Y.  pestis  CO92  caf  were  grown  overnight  at  26°C 
versus  37°C  in  Heart-Infusion  Broth  (HIB,  Difco).  Cultures 
were diluted 1:100 after overnight growth and grown at 26°C 
and  37°C  to  log  phase  in  HIB  medium.  Cultures  were  
harvested by centrifugation and washed once with Phosphate 
buffered saline buffer (PBS, pH 7.4). Y. pestis (2 x 106 CFU/ 
ml) were incubated with various concentration of granulysin 
as  described  above  and  plated  on  HIB  agar  plates.  CFU’s 
were  counted  after  48h  incubation  at  26°C.  Results  for  
all  isolates  were  verified  by  three  (B.  mallei,  B.  anthracis), 
four  (S.  Typhimurium,  F.  tularensis),  or  five  (Y.  pestis)  
independent  experiments.  A 
independent  
experiments  were  performed  with  Y.  pestis  to  firmly  
establish  the  temperature-dependent  differences  in  suscepti-
bility  to  peptide.  Data  were  analyzed  by  one-way  analysis  
of  variance  (ANOVA)  followed  by  a  Tukey’s  pair  wise  
comparison test (GraphPad Software v4.0).

RESULTS 

In  this  study,  we  tested  the  antimicrobial  activity  of  the 
 
granulysin peptide against four aerosol-acquired select agent 
bacterial pathogens, B. anthracis, Y. pestis, F. tularensis, and 
B. mallei. S. Typhimurium was used as a positive control to 
compare  the  relative  antibacterial  activity  of  the  peptide  
observed  in  earlier  studies  [7,  10,  12].  To  normalize  data 
across  experiments  and  organisms,  results  in  Fig.  (1)  are 
shown as percentage of control growth from each individual 
experiment.  Statistically  significant  differences  due  to  treat-
ment,  however,  were  determined  using  actual  CFU  relative 
to  peptide  concentrations.  A  peptide  derived  from  a  region  
in  granulysin  previously  determined  to  lack  antimicrobial 
activity (helix 1) was used as a negative control [6, 7, 10].  

In support of previous studies with peptide and recombi-
 
nant protein [7, 10, 12], we observed that granulysin peptide 
had  potent  antimicrobial  activity  against  S.  Typhimurium 
with  a  significant,  dose  dependent,  increase  in  activity  from 
1  to  100  μM  peptide  concentration  (Fig.  1).  A  significant 
reduction  of  B.  anthracis,  F.  tularensis,  and  B.  mallei  
was  evident  at  10  and  100  μM  of  peptide  (Fig.  1),  though  
B.  anthracis  and  F.  tularensis  were  less  susceptible  to  100 
μM levels than B. mallei or S. Typhimurium. The concentra-
tion  of  peptide  required  to  reduce  CFU  of  B.  anthracis  and 
F.  tularensis  was  comparable  to  peptide  concentrations  
required to reduce Mtb and M. bovis, in similar studies [5, 7, 
12].  The  killing  activity  of  granulysin  against  F.  tularensis 
SHU S4 (virulent) and LVS (attenuated vaccine strain) were 
similar  (data  not  shown)  indicating  that  susceptibility  to 
granulysin  peptide  is  not  a  likely  variable  in  pathogenesis. 
Surprisingly, the negative control peptide derived from helix 
1  had  moderate  activity  against B.  anthracis  at  a  concentra-
tion  of  100  μM  (38%  reduction  of  CFU’s  as  compared  to  
the  no  peptide  control;  data  not  shown).  The  growth  of  
S.  Typhimurium,  Y.  pestis,  F.  tularensis,  or  B.  mallei,  was 
not affected by the helix 1 peptide when compared to growth 
in  the  absence  of  peptide.  Due  to  the  effects  of  the  helix  1 
peptide  on  B.  anthracis,  the  no  peptide  control  CFUs  were 
used  to  calculate  the  percentage  of  control  growth  shown  
in  Fig.  (1).  As  shown  in  Fig.  (2),  Y.  pestis  growth  was  also

Fig. (2). Activity of granulysin peptide against Y. pestis  is growth temperature-dependent. CFU reduction of Y. pestis  (CO 92) across 
granulysin peptide concentration when grown at 26°C and 37°C.  Reduction of CFU following 3 h incubation with peptide was determined  
by  overnight  growth  on  HIB  agar  plates.  Percentage  reduction  from  control  growth  at  representative  peptide  concentrations  is  shown  in  
parenthesis. Data shown are mean ± SEM of five independent experiments. Compared to negative control, growth was significantly (p<0.01) 
reduced by 5 to 100 μM concentration of granulysin peptide at both 26 and 37°C. Effects of peptide on growth reduction were significantly 
different (p<0.05) at 26°C compared to 37°C from 5 to 100 μM concentration. 

significantly reduced by the granulysin active site peptide in 
a  dose-dependent  manner.  A  growth  temperature-dependent 
susceptibility of Y. pestis to cationic peptides has previously 
been characterized [13-15]. To determine if this effect could 
be  observed  with  granulysin,  Y.  pestis  was  incubated  with 
the  peptide  after  growth  at  ambient  temperature,  generally 
corresponding to that in the flea arthropod vector (26°C), or 
human  body  temperature  (37°C).  When  grown  at  ambient 
temperature to exponential growth phase, Y. pestis was much 
more  resistant  to  the  effects  of  granulysin  peptide.  In  fact, 
the  reduction  of Y.  pestis  growth  by  granulysin  peptide  was 
several orders of magnitude greater when grown at 37°C,  as 
compared to growth at 26°C (Fig. 2). As a percentage of the 
negative  control,  however,  significant  reduction  of  Y.  pestis 
by  5  to  100  μM  concentrations  of  granulysin  peptide  was 
evident  at  both  temperatures  (Fig.  2,  numbers  in  parenthe-
sis). Recently, surface-exposed bacterial molecules (capsular 
antigen fraction 1) have been shown to modulate the suscep-
tibility of Y. pestis to antimicrobial molecules in the respira-
tory  epithelium  [16].  To  evaluate  the  role  of  the  capsule  
substance  in  the  susceptibility  of  Y.  pestis  to  granulysin,  a 
capsule-negative mutant of Y. pestis CO 92 (Y. pestis CO 92 
caf) was also grown at both temperatures prior to incubation 
with peptide. The mutant contains a 1,176 bp deletion in the 
caf-operon  eliminating  synthesis  of  Caf1  capsular  subunit 
and  Caf1A  usher  proteins  (V.  Motin,  unpublished).  A  
temperature-dependent  difference  in  killing  activity  by  Y. 
pestis  CO  92  caf  was  observed  similar  to  the  wild-type  
strain shown in Fig. (2), while the presence or absence of the 
capsule  did  not  affect  the  susceptibility  (data  not  shown). 
These  differences  in  susceptibility  to  the  antimicrobial  
effects  of  granulysin  peptide,  due  to  temperature,  were  
not  caused  by  altered  growth  patterns  as  organisms  grew  to 
similar density at both temperatures (Fig. 2).  

DISCUSSION 

  The  identification  of  immune  mechanisms  that  can  
protect  against  bacterial  select  agent  pathogens  is  a  critical 
component in the development of control measures for these 
potential  biothreats.  The  important  role  of  both  innate  and 
acquired cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses to intracel-
lular  pathogens  strongly  supports  the  need  to  characterize 
CMI  mechanisms  that  can  be  targeted  to  prevent  disease  or 
improve  clinical  outcome.  In  this  study  we  showed  that 
granulysin,  a  cytotoxic  lymphocyte-derived  antimicrobial, 
may have an important role in immunity to several important 
intracellular bacteria with select agent status.  

  Granulysin  is  a  cationic  molecule  that  consists  of  five 
compact  (cid:1)-helical  segments.  Homologues  of  granulysin  in 
multiple  mammalian  species,  fish,  and  birds  indicates  con-
servation  of  this  antimicrobial  mechanism  [2,  12,  17-21]. 
Curiously, a granulysin homologue has not been identified in 
mice,  hampering  studies  of  the  effects  of  gene  deletion.  In 
contrast to other antimicrobial molecules of the immune sys-
tem,  granulysin  expression  is  limited  to  NK  cells  and  anti-
gen-specific  T  cells,  the  cytotoxic  component  of  the  CMI 
response.  Expression  is  constitutive  in  NK  cells  and  induc-
ible  in  antigen  specific  T  cells  following  activation  with  
specific  antigen  or  cytokines[1-3].  Native  granulysin  has 
chemoattractant  capabilities  [22]  and  has  recently  been  
implicated  in  adverse  drug  reactions  that  affect  epidermal 
cells  [23].  Normally,  granulysin  does  not  have  cytotoxic  
effects  on  non-transformed  human  cells,  while  induction  of 
apoptosis  of  tumor  cells  has  been  shown  by  several  groups 
[10,  24,  25].  Peptide  mapping  in  three  separate  species  has 
characterized  a core amino acid region  including residues  in 
helix  2  through  helix  3  as  the  lytic  site  [6,  7,  10,  12].  The 
localization  of  the  antimicrobial  activity  of  granulysin  to  a 
short amino acid segment indicates the potential for use as a

therapuetic  peptide,  as  has  been  described  for  other  small 
“killer” peptides [26]. Peptides derived from the lytic site of 
granulysin  are  able  to  reproduce  the  antimicrobial  effects  of  
recombinant  granulysin.  The  activity  of  the  derived  peptide 
can  exceed  the  recombinant  molecule  [5,  7],  an  effect  that 
may  be  due  to  the  harsh  denaturing  conditions  required  to 
purify  the  recombinant  molecule  or  to  a  membrane  contact 
advantage of the peptide. Nonetheless,  this peptide is an  im-
portant  screening  tool  to  identify  the  antibacterial  potential 
of  granulysin  against  different  bacterial  pathogens  and  may 
also  have  utility  as  a  bactericidal  therapeutic.  Granulysin-
derived  peptides  have  been  shown  to  neutralize  LPS  simul-
taneously with direct bacterial killing and may have potential 
as  a  treatment for septic shock [11]. In the  current  study we 
also  observed  antimicrobial  effects  of  the  peptide  derived 
from  helix  1  of  granulysin  against  B.  anthracis.  This  result 
was  unexpected,  as  peptides  corresponding  to  the  helix  1 
region  of  granulysin  have  previously  been  reported  to  have 
no  antimicrobial  activity  [6,  7,  10]  Following  elucidation  
of  the  crystal  structure  of  granulysin,  however,  the  helix  1 
region was predicted to contribute to the antimicrobial activ-
ity  of  granulysin  due  to  the  distribution  and  orientation  of 
positively  charged  amino  acids  in  this  region  [27].  Further 
studies  with  peptides  and  site  specific  amino  acid  substitu-
tion  in  recombinant  protein  are  needed  to  fully  characterize 
the  lytic  sites  utilized  by  granulysin  against  various  classes 
of microbial pathogens. 

  Our  results  demonstrate  that  granulysin  may  have  very 
potent lytic effects on Y. pestis and B. mallei and can reduce 
the  growth  of  F.  tularensis  and  B.  anthracis  at  higher  con-
centrations.  The  relative  potency  of  granulysin  to  reduce 
bacterial  numbers  in  the  current  study  varied  by  organism, 
and in regards  to Y. pestis, the effect is temperature depend-
ent.  Collectively,  the  results  from  these  and  other  studies 
suggest  that  the  surface-exposed  structures  on  microbial 
membranes  that determine susceptibility  to granulysin  could 
differ  among  microorganisms,  or  vary  in  response  to  
environmental  signals.  Peptides  derived  from  granulysin  
are  able  to  bind  LPS  and  neutralize  LPS-induced  secretion  
of TNF(cid:1) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells [11]. Differ-
ences  in  acylation  of  the  LPS  lipid  A  moiety  due  to  
environmental temperature is a defined mechanism for bacte-
rial  resistance  to  antimicrobial  peptides  [28].  Antimicrobial 
peptides have a significant role in insect host defense and are 
an  important  selective  pressure  for  survival  of  bacteria  that 
utilize  insect  reservoirs.  With  regard  to  Y.  pestis,  growth  at 
environmental temperature increases the resistance of Y. pes-
tis  to  cationic  molecules  with  antimicrobial  activity  [13-15]. 
These  differences  are  frequently  attributed  to  temperature-
induced  alterations  in  lipid  A  acylation  [13-15,  29],  though 
acyl  transferase deficiency has no effect on Y. pestis suscep-
tibility to polymyxin B [30]. Very recently, bacterial capsule 
polysaccharides  from  several  species  were  demonstrated  to 
mediate  resistance  to  both  polymyxin  B  and  alpha-defensin 
from  human  neutrophils  and  were  proposed  to  act  as  bacte-
rial  decoys  for  antibacterial  peptides  [31].  Susceptibility  of 
Y.  pestis  to  beta-defensin  and  cathelicidin  was  also  recently 
shown  to  be  mediated  by  the  capsular  antigen  fraction  [16]. 
In  our  studies,  a  Y.  pestis  variant  deficient  for  the  capsule 
substance  was  not  more  susceptible  to  granulysin  peptide 
effects. Thus, the role of capsule polysaccharides as bacterial 

decoys  may  be  an  important  difference  between  granulysin 
and other cationic antimicrobial molecules.  

  As  previously  observed,  high  concentrations  of  granu-
lysin  are  required  to  kill  micro-organisms  in  bulk  culture 
compared  to  antibiotics or many synthetic  antimicrobials [5, 
7, 12]. An important difference between granulysin and other 
antimicrobials  is  that  NK  cells  and  antigen-specific  T  cells 
deliver  granulysin  to  individual  target  cells  at  sites  of  infec-
tion.  These  cytotoxic  immune  cells  are  able  to  methodically 
kill  one  infected  target  at  a  time  using  only  a  portion  of 
available granules while continually replenishing the granule 
armament.  Perforin  functions  to  increase  membrane  perme-
ability of target cells to facilitate entry and activity of granu-
lysin  and  granzymes  [5,  32,  33].  Granulysin  molecules  are 
able to directly disrupt microbial membranes by electrostatic 
charge  disruption  [7,  27,  34].  Granulysin  can  also  elicit  
extra-cellular microbicidal effects against pathogens[5, 9]. In 
this  regard,  both  virulent  Francisella  and  LVS  were  shown 
to  have  a  significant  extra-cellular  phase  in  their in  vivo  life 
cycle [35].  

  The  antibacterial  effects  of 
the  granulysin  peptide  
observed in the current study support continued investigation 
of  granulysin  as  an  important  cytotoxic  effector  molecule 
contributing  to  the  protective  CMI  responses  to  these  and 
other  serious  biothreats.  Promoting  activation  of  granulysin 
expression by NK cells and T cells could represent an impor-
tant  avenue  for  immune  modulation  to  protect  susceptible 
populations from weaponized or naturally occurring bacterial 
pathogens.  Strategies  to  promote  activation  of  NK  cell  an-
timicrobial activity may be very effective  in the early  innate 
immune  response  to  several  pathogens.  Promoting  antimi-
crobial protein expression as part of the effector repertoire of 
antigen-specific  T  cells  may  also  improve  vaccine  efficacy. 
In summary, induction of granulysin by NK cells or antigen-
specific  T  cells  should  be  further  characterized  as  a  mecha-
nism 
intracellular bacterial pathogens.
