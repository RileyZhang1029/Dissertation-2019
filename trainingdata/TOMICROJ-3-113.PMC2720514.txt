Abstract:  This  study  compared  phenotypic  and  genotypic  identification  of  Actinomyces  strains,  tested  susceptibility  to  
antibiotics  and  evaluated  their  clinical  importance.  Thirty-four  Actinomyces  strains  were  examined;  sixteen  type  strains, 
and  18  clinical  strains  from  different  hospitals  in  Denmark  from  the  period  2003-2005.  Partial  16S  rDNA  sequencing  
using a stretch of 526 bases was used for genotypic identification. Susceptibility testing was done by E-test. The antibiotics 
examined were: benzylpenicillin, piperacillin with tazobactam, ceftriaxone, meropenem, erythromycin, clindamycin, line-
zolid,  moxifloxacin,  tetracycline  and  tigecycline.  Clinical  parameters  were  obtained  by  reviewing  patient  records.  There 
was  poor  agreement  between  the  phenotypic  and  genotypic  identification.  Phenotypic  tests  were  helpful  in  identifying 
strains closely related by DNA sequences. The strains were sensitive to the examined antibiotics except for moxifloxacin 
to  which  most  strains  were  resistant,  and  a  few  strains  were  resistant  to  meropenem  and  tetracycline.  The  clinical  
strains were from many different types of  infections  and locations. None of the patients was described as having typical 
actinomycetic lesions, and an apparently good outcome was obtained with different treatment regimens.  

Keywords: Actinomyces species, Bacterial identification, phenotypic characterization, partial 16S rDNA sequencing.  

INTRODUCTION 

  The  genus  Actinomyces  consists  of  a  heterogeneous 
group  of  anaerobic  and  facultative  anaerobic,  asporogenous, 
Gram-positive,  non-acid-fast,  rod-shaped  organisms  [1], 
many  of  which  occur  as  inhabitants  of  mucosal  surfaces, 
particularly  the  oral  cavity,  of  humans  and  animals.  Actino-
myces  species  can  cause  actinomycosis,  a  chronic  granulo-
matous  lesion,  forming  suppurative  abscesses  and  draining 
sinuses.  Localization  is  most  often  cervicofacial  (60%),  
thoracic  (15%)  or  abdominal  (20%)  [1].  Both  laboratory 
identification  and  clinical  diagnosis  is  often  troublesome. 
Coryneform bacteria are difficult to classify at the species or 
even  at  the  genus  level  [2]  and  poses  major  problems  for 
clinical  microbiology  laboratories  in  terms  of  labour,  time, 
and  cost,  when  conventional  methods  are  used.  Panels  of 
phenotypic  characteristics  useful  in  identifying  species  have 
been described by Funke et al. [2] and Sarkonen et al. [3]. 

  An  increased  recognition  of  the  importance  of  coryne-
form  bacteria  as  opportunistic  human  pathogens  within  the 
last decade [4], has occurred in a period where new diagnos-
tic  tools  for  identification  of  bacteria  progressively  have 
been  introduced. These techniques,  especially  sequencing of 
genes  coding  for  rRNA  have  revolutionized  the  insight  into 
phylogeny and taxonomy of bacteria.  

  We  therefore  found  it  relevant  to  characterize  34  strains 
of  Actinomyces  species  from  humans,  18  recent  Danish

clinical strains and 16 type strains of different species, using 
a  recent  phenotypical  identification  scheme,  and  compare  
the  results  to  genotypic  identification  using  partial  16S 
rDNA  sequencing.  In  addition,  susceptibility  to  antibiotics 
was  determined  and  data  on  clinical  manifestations  of  the 
respective patients was obtained. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Bacterial Strains  

  We  examined  34  Actinomyces  strains.  Sixteen  type 
strains, received from CCUG (Culture Collection, University 
of  Göteborg,  Göteborg,  Sweden),  were 
included:  A.  
europaeus  CCUG  32789AT,  A.  funkei  CCUG  42773T,  A. 
georgiae  CCUG  32935T,  A.  gerencseriae  CCUG  32936T,  A. 
graevenitzii  CCUG  27294T,  A.  israelii  CCUG  18307T,  A. 
meyeri CCUG 21024T, A. naeslundii CCUG 18310T, A. neuii 
subsp. neuii CCUG 32252T, A. neuii subsp. anitratus CCUG 
32253T,  A.  odontolyticus  CCUG  20536T,  A.  radicidentis 
CCUG  36733T,  A.  radingae  CCUG  32394T,  A.  turicensis 
CCUG  34269T,  A.  urogenitalis  CCUG  38702T,  A.  viscosus 
CCUG 14476T. Eighteen strains were clinical strains submit-
ted  from  Danish  Departments  of  Clinical  Microbiology  
to  the  National  Reference  Laboratory  for  identification  
of  bacteria,  at  Statens  Serum  Institut  (SSI),  in  the  period  
February 2003 - March 2005. All strains were kept as frozen  
(- 80 °C) stocks. 

Phenotypic Identification 

  The  strains  were  subcultured  on  10  %  horse  blood  agar 
(SSI  Diagnostica,  Hillerød,  Denmark),  and  the  agar  plates 

2009 Bentham Open

were incubated for five days at 35 °C in ambient air, a CO2-
enriched  (5  %)  and  an  anaerobic  atmosphere,  respectively. 
Colonial  morphology  and  microscopic  appearance  in  Gram-
stained  preparations  were  noted.  CAMP  reaction  was  
examined  on  CAMP  agar  (SSI  Diagnostica)  with  a  beta-
hemolysin-producing  strain  of  Staphylococcus  aureus. 
CAMP-plates were  incubated  at 35 °C  in a  CO2-enriched (5 
%) and an anaerobic atmosphere, respectively, and were read 
after  24-h  and  48-h  incubation.  Testing  for  nitrate  reduction 
was performed using a nitrate broth culture (semi-solid agar) 
incubated  at  35  °C  in  an  anaerobic  atmosphere  for  a  
minimum  of  five  days,  prior  to  addition  of  sulfanilic  acid, 
Cleves  acid,  and  if  necessary  zinc  powder  [5,  6].  Rosco  
diagnostic  tablets  (Rosco  A/S,  Taastrup,  Denmark)  were 
used for testing hydrolysis of urea and esculin, production of  
(cid:1)-fucosidase,  (cid:1)-glucosidase,  (cid:2)-N-acetylglucosaminidase  
((cid:2)-NAG)  and  (cid:2)-galactosidase  (ONPG),  and  acid  production 
from L-arabinose, following the instructions of the manufac-
turer.  A.  israelii  and  A.  gerencseriae  were  differentiated 
from  each  other  by  the  presence  of  (cid:1)-mannosidase  and  
arginine  dihydrolase  (ADH).  Acid  production  from  L-
arabinose,  maltose,  mannitol,  raffinose,  rhamnose,  sucrose, 
xylose  and  trehalose  was  tested  in  tubes  with  extract-
bouillon  and  the  carbohydrate  (SSI  Diagnostica)  [6],  incu-
bated at 35 °C in an anaerobic atmosphere for a minimum of 
five  days.  Horse  citrate  plasma  was  added  to  promote 
growth.  All  tests,  except  testing  for  the  presence  of  (cid:1)-
mannosidase,  were  performed  by  more  than  one  method,  as 
the  strains  were  also  tested  with  the  API(cid:3)  strips,  Rapid  ID 
32  A  and  API  20  A(cid:3)  (bioMérieux(cid:3)  as,  Marcy  l’Etoile, 
France)  following  the  instructions  of  the  manufacturer. 
Rapid  ID  32  A  tested:  ability  to  reduce  nitrate,  the  presence 
of  urease,  (cid:1)-fucosidase,  (cid:1)-glucosidase,  (cid:2)-NAG,  ONPG  and 
ADH,  and  acid  production  from  raffinose.  API  20  A(cid:3) 
tested:  presence  of  urease,  hydrolysis  of  esculin,  acid  
production  from  arabinose,  maltose,  mannitol,  raffinose, 
rhamnose,  sucrose,  xylose  and  trehalose.  Catalase  was  
detected  with  10  %  H2O2  in  a  well  in  the  API  20  A(cid:3)  strip 
with a positive reaction. 

Ribosomal DNA Sequencing 

 
For  molecular  biological  study  DNA  was  released  by 
heating  isolated  bacteria  at  95°C  for  5  min.  PCR  amplifica-
tion  of  part  of  the  16S  rRNA  gene  was  performed  using  
the primers BSF-8 and BSR-534 as previously described [7]. 
DNA  sequences  were  aligned  and  edited  at  http://bioinfo. 
genotoul.fr/multalin/multalin.html  resulting  in  comparable 
sequences  ranging  from  324  to  351  basepairs.  Furthermore, 
all  edited  sequences  were  compared  to  deposited  sequences 
in  the  Bio  Informatic  Bacteria  Identification  database.  
Sequences  obtained  for  clinical  strains  were  compared  to 
original CCUG sequences of collection strains. Results were 
illustrated  in  a  phylogentic  tree  using  CLC  workbench  4.5 
software.  

Susceptibility Testing  

  The MICs of all the strains were determined using E-test 
(AB  Biodisk,  Solna,  Sweden)  for  the  following  antibiotics: 
benzylpenicillin,  piperacillin  with  tazobactam,  ceftriaxone, 
meropenem,  erythromycin,  clindamycin,  linezolid,  moxi-
floxacin,  tetracycline,  and  tigecycline.  All  tests  were  per-

Hansen et al. 

formed  on  anaerobic  plates  (SSI  Diagnostica).  Plates  were 
inoculated  with  the  bacterial  isolates  in  API  suspension  
medium  (demineralised  water)  (bioMérieux(cid:3)  as,  Marcy 
l’Etoile,  France)  with  a  turbidity  equivalent  of  McFarland 
standard 4,0 [8] and incubated anaerobically at 35 ºC for 48-
72 hours. Results were read  according to the manufacturer’s 
guidelines. Quality controls were performed using Bacteroi-
des  fragilis  (ATCC  25285).  MIC  measurements  (at  least 
triplicate)  for  the  control  strain  were  as  follows:  Penicillin:  
>  32  μg/ml,  piperacillin/tazobactam:  0.25-0.5  μg/ml,  cef-
triaxone: 32 μg/ml, meropenem: 0.064 μg/ml, erythromycin: 
1.5 μg/ml, clindamycin: 0.75-2.0 μg/ml, linezolid: 1.5 μg/ml.  

Clinical Data 

Information on predisposing factors, actual diagnosis and 

 
antibiotic treatment was recorded from patient files. 

RESULTS 

Phenotypic Identification 

  The  appearance  of  the  strains  varied  both  in  the  Gram-
stained  preparations  and  with  growth  on  agar.  Micro- 
scopically  many  strains  were  without  visible  branching, 
many  were  small  rods  with  an  appearance  similar  to  the 
coryneforms,  other  were  coccoid  or  long  and  curved  rods. 
On agar most strains were grey or white, colony-sizes ranged 
from  pinpoint  to  three  mm  in  diameter,  and  some  had  (cid:1)-
haemolysis.  Colonies could be rough or smooth, elevated or 
flat,  and  some  adhered  to  agar.  The  incubation  atmosphere 
influenced  appearance  and  growth;  some  strains  did  not 
grow in ambient air.  

  Table  1  shows  results  of  phenotypic  identification  of 
Actinomyces  strains  following  the  recommendations  of  
Sarkonen et al. [3]. All type strains were correctly identified. 
We  used  the  same  type  strains  as  Sarkonen et  al.  except  for 
the  type  strain  of  A.  israelii.  The  clinical  strains  were 
grouped from the phenotypic identification; one strain  could 
not  be  designated  to  a  species  by  the  performed  phenotypic 
characterization. 

  Results  of  individual  biochemical  reactions  sometimes 
differed  when  tested  with  different  methods.  This  was  for 
example  seen  when 
testing  nitrate  reduction,  esculin  
hydrolysis and acid production from carbohydrates.  

Genotypic Identification 

  All type strains were correctly identified. For the 16 type 
strains best taxon match had scores from 642 to 672 bits and 
differences  to  next  best  taxon  matches  between  22  and  260 
bits.  Some  species  were  more  closely  related  than  others;  
A.  meyerii  and  A.  odontolyticus  were  most  closely  related, 
followed  by  A.  viscosus  and  A.  naeslundii.  A.  radingae  was 
least  connected  to  the  other  species.  For  18  clinical  strains 
scores of 480 to 670 bits were found with differences to next 
best taxon matches between 2 and 245 bits.  

  One  of  the  clinical  strains  could  not  be  allocated  to  a  
species  on  phenotypic  characteristics,  wherefore  17  clinical 
strains could be compared (Fig. 1).

Fig. (1). Phylogenetic tree illustrating the relationship between the 16 type strains and the 18 clinical strains. Six clinical strains did not reach 
concordance between genotypic / phenotypic* identification (five  with different  species names  and one with no species identification). The 
remaining 12 strains were allocated to the same species when comparing the two methods of identification.  

Genotypic/Phenotypic Identification 

  Ten  of  the  17  clinical  strains  showed  methodological 
agreement  at  the  species  level.  Two  additional  strains 
showed  concordance  as  BLAST  examinations  could  not 
separate (bits score difference < 30) between A. viscosus and 
A. naeslundii; the latter was proposed from phenotypic char-
acterization  (and  second  BLAST  choice)  and  the  former 
from  first  BLAST  choice.  Thus,  for  12  of  17  strains  results 
from phenotypic and molecular examinations were in agree-
ment.  BLAST examinations for all strains seemed very con-
vincing  when  taking  all  parameters  into  consideration  (Fig. 
1).  Thus,  for  five  of  17  clinical  strains  identifications  by 
genotypic/phenotypic methods were in disagreement as indi-
cated  in  Fig.  (1)  with  an  *.  One  isolate  could  not  be  desig-
nated  to  a  species  based  on  phenotypic  characterization, 
which by genotypic identification belonged to the species A. 
meyerii.  The  isolates  with  disagreeing  identifications  were 
(genotypic/phenotypic  identification):  1)  A.  odontolyticus/A. 
radingae  (n=1),  2)  A.  radingae/A.  gerencseriae  (n=1),  3)  A. 
gerencseriae/A.  israelii  (n=1),  4)  A.  israelii/A.  viscosus  and 
5) A. meyerii/A. turicensis.  

Susceptibility Testing  

  The  MICs  for  the  34  strains  are  shown  in  Table  2.  All 
strains  were  sensitive 
to  benzylpenicillin,  piperacillin/ 

tazobactam,  ceftriaxone,  meropenem,  erythromycin,  clin-
damycin,  linezolid,  tetracycline  and  tigecycline,  except  for 
meropenem  and  tetracycline  where  one  strain  for  each  anti-
biotic had MIC values above the upper limits for sensitivity. 
Notably  for  moxifloxacin,  21  strains  had  MIC`s  above  the 
upper  limit  for  being  sensitive  though  most  strains  (n=16) 
were close to the breaking point. We experienced difficulties 
reading  zone  diameters  due  to  hazy  zone  edges,  which  
explains why it was not possible to define an MIC value for 
1-5 strains for each antibiotic.  

Clinical Data 

  Table 3 shows clinical and microbiological data on the 18 
patients from whom Actinomyces species were isolated. The 
patients  have  been  divided  into  groups  based  on  species  
designations  from  the  genotypic  identification.  The  clinical 
strains  were  chosen  at  random  during  the  period  February 
2003  -  March  2005.  The  median  age  was  54  years,  10  were 
men and 8 women. 

  The  strains  were  from  soft  tissue  infections  (5  strains), 
blood  (4),  intraabdominal  abscesses  (3),  periodontal  infec-
tions  (2),  and  one  strain  each  from  pus  from  bladder,  
empyema of the pleural space, spinal fluid and a swab from 
cornea.

  Nine  patients  received  both  surgical  intervention  and 
antibiotic  treatment  and,  respectively,  5  and  4  patients  
received  either  antibiotic  treatment  or  surgical  intervention. 
When  antibiotics  were  given,  the  drug(s)  and  duration  
varied, but always included (cid:1)-lactam antibiotics. The follow-
ing  (cid:1)-lactam  antibiotics  were  used:  penicillin,  ampicillin, 
dicloxacillin,  mecillinam,  cefuroxime,  ceftriaxone  and  
meropenem.  In  some  cases  ciprofloxacin,  gentamicin  and 
metronidazole  were  added.  The  patient  with  keratitis  was 
treated  with  topical  agents  containing  chloramphenicol,  
tetracycline,  polymyxin  and  gentamicin.  All  patients  recov-
ered,  except  one  who  died  from  other  causes.  Two  patients 
had  sequelae;  one  each  with  neurologic  sequelae  following 
meningitis and reduced vision following keratitis. 

DISCUSSION 

  When  describing  the  species  A.  europaeus  in  1997  [2], 
Funke et al. used 15 phenotypic  characteristics  to differenti-
ate the species from other human-derived,  aerobically grow-
ing  Actinomyces  and  Arcanobacterium  species.  In  the 
scheme by Sarkonen et al. [3] using 18 characteristics, which 
also is used in this study, the same characteristics were used 
except  that  pyrazinamidase  production  and  acid  production 
from  glucose  plus  glycogen  was  not  tested  for.  However, 
additionally  the  scheme  by  Sarkonen  et  al.  [3]  takes  into 
consideration  pigmentation,  production  of  (cid:1)-fucosidase  and 
acid  production  from  arabinose,  raffinose,  rhamnose  and 
trehalose. The number of Actinomyces species has increased 
since  these  schemes  were  made.  Often  new  species  have 
been  created  from  subgroups  of  existing  species,  complicat-
ing  the  destinction  between  species  based  on  phenotypic 
characteristics  as  inclusion  of  new  tests  have  been  needed  
for  differentiation  between  species  [1].  The  fact  that  the  
 

same  reaction  done  with  different  methods,  as  also  seen  in 
this  study,  may  result  in  diverse  results  complicates  pheno-
typic identification even more. Recently, former genospecies 
1  and  2  of  A.  naeslundii  have  been  validly  published  as  
A.  oris  sp.  nov.  and  A.  johnsonii  sp.  nov.;  these  new  species 
cannot  be  readily  differentiated  using  conventional  pheno-
typic  testing  [9].  All  these  developments  stresses  the  need  
for  applicating  molecular  methods  for  identification  of 
Actinomyces. 

  Actinomyces  species  has  a  varied  appearance  in  the  
microscope.  It  may  be  the  typical  Gram-positive  branching 
bacilli,  which  often  present  with  a  beaded  appearance,  
but not seldom more coccoid or variable forms occurs. Like-
wise,  the  typical  molar  tooth  appearance  of  A.  israelii  may 
be  absent.  The  appearance  may  be  similar  to  common 
relatively  avirulent  pathogens,  which  often  may  be  present 
together  with  Actinomyces  species.  It  is  therefore  likely  
that  Actinomyces  sometimes  is  overlooked  in  samples.  
Misidentifications  or  non-identifications  are  presumed  to 
occur  in  the  routine  microbiology  laboratory.  16S  rRNA 
gene  sequence  analysis  has  shown  to  be  a  powerful  test  
in  confirming  or  identifying  suspected  or  non-identified 
Actinomyces species.  

  Three  of  the  examined  strains  had  very  low  differences  
in  scores  between  best  and  next  best  taxon  matches.  When 
examining  phylogenetic  trees  based  on  a  comparison  of  
approximately  1,320  nucleotides,  A.  meyerii  and  A.  odon- 
tolyticus,  and  A.  viscosus  and  A.  naeslundii,  are  closely  
related  explaining  the  low  bits-differences  [2].  Results  of 
phenotypic  reaction  may  be  helpful  in  species  identification 
in such cases. All in all, 16S rDNA sequencing of a 526 base-
pair  stretch  gave  a  good  separation  into  proposed  species.

Sequence analysis  is  especially useful when  a rapid identifi-
cation  is  desired  due  to  for  example  clinical  circumstances. 
Thus,  molecular  bacterial  identification  is  a  powerful  tool  
for  national  reference  laboratories  enhancing  both  the  speed 
and  validity  of  performed  examinations.  Using  BLAST  
examinations  may  also  be  helpful  in  giving  up  to  date  
taxonomic considerations.  

In  vitro  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  Actinomyces  

 
species  is  quite  predictable  [10].  Strains  are  generally  sensi-
tive  to  (cid:1)-lactams.  However,  some  may  exhibit  higher  MIC 
values as also shown by McNeil and Schaal. The medium we 
used  for  susceptibility  testing  contains  L-cystein,  which  
reduces  the  activity  of  (cid:1)-lactam  antibiotics  [11];  therefore, 
underestimated  susceptibility  for  these  antimicrobial  agents 
can  be  expected.  Erythromycin  was  the  most  active  antimi-
crobial agent in vitro, followed by tigecycline. Clindamycin, 
linezolid  and  tetracycline  also  showed  good in-vitro  activity 
with MICs within the therapeutic range for all strains, except 
one  strain,  that  was  resistant  to  tetracycline.  It  is  important 
knowing  that  fluorquinolones  generally  have  poor  activity 
against  Actinomyces  species  [10].  In  agreement  with  this 
moxifloxacin  for  most  strains  in  this  study  had  MIC  values 
above  the  upper  limit  for  sensitivity.  Susceptibility  testing  
of  Actinomyces  species  can  be  problematic;  therefore,  it 
would  be  relevant  to  elaborate  standard  guidelines  for  
susceptibility  testing  procedure  and  to  determine  species-
specific breakpoints. 

identification 

the  most  frequently 

 
In  the  article  by  Clarridge  III  and  Zhang  [12]  a  large 
number of clinical Actinomyces species were examined. Sev-
enty-three strains were identified by genotypic identification. 
A.  turicensis  was  the  most  frequently  isolated  species.  With 
genotypic 
identified  
species  in  our  study  were  A.  turicensis  and  A.  meyeri.  The 
normal  niche  of  A.  turicensis  has  been  assessed  [12]  to  be 
gastrointestinal,  genital  or  skin  in  that  area.  Some  strains 
were  also  isolated  from  abscesses  of  the  face,  neck,  breast, 
chest and back. Our findings are in accordance with this, see 
Table  3.  The  normal  niche  of  A.  meyeri,  A.  israelii  and  A. 
odontolyticus  was  assessed  to  be  oropharynx,  and  this  is  in 
accordance  with  three  of  our  A.  meyeri  strains  being  from 
abscess  of  cheek,  root  of  tooth  and  empyema  of  pleural 
space, respectively. Finally, A. radingae was associated with 
chronic  soft  tissue  abscesses  of  the  breast,  chest  and  back, 
and  the  normal  niche  was  assessed  to  be  skin  of  the  upper 
body.  One  of  our  two  strains  was  from  an  abscess  on  the 
back.  

  Actinomyces  is  often  difficult  to  diagnose  and  eradicate, 
needing  surgery  and  a  long  course  of  antibiotics  [13,  14]. 
Typical actinomycetic lesions contain between 1 and 10 bac-
terial  species  in  addition  to  the  pathogenic  Actinomycetes 
[10].  We  do  not  have  information  of  typical  actinomycotic 
lesions in our patients. Several of the patients did not receive 
antibiotics  at  all  or  only  short  courses  of  treatment  with  
recovery.  These  cases  were  especially  soft  tissue  infections, 
but  also  abscesses  in  the  abdomen  and  positive  blood  
cultures. Thus, it is important to be aware of that many infec-
tions involving Actinomyces species may not present as typi-
cal  actinomycetic  lesions.  The  great  recovery  rate  may  be 

associated  to  the  wide  range  of  antibiotic  sensitivity  (except 
quinolones)  among  Actinomyces  species  and  that  infections 
may  have  a  milder/different  course  than  the  classic  severe  
A.  israelii  infections  and  therefore  not  necessitating  the  
very  long  periods  of  high  doses  of  forenstance  penicillin  as 
otherwise recommended.  

 
In  conclusion,  we  find  poor  agreement  between  the  
phenotypic  and  genotypic  identification  of  Actinomyces  
species.  Phenotypic  tests  were  helpful  in  identifying  strains 
closely related by DNA sequences. The examined Actinomy-
ces strains were in-vitro sensitive to many antibiotics includ-
ing ß-lactams, but not quinolones, and two strains were resis-
tant  to  meropenem  and  tetracycline,  respectively.  Standard 
guidelines  for  susceptibility  testing  of  Actinomyces  are  
lacking.  With  a  varied  appearance,  both  microscopically  
and  on  agar,  often  looking  like  common  relatively  avirulent 
bacteria,  Actinomyces may  easily  be  overlooked  in  samples. 
Actinomyces  can  be  present  in  infections  without  typical 
actinomycetic lesions, and some of these infections probably 
do  not  need  the  same  aggressive  and  long  treatment  as 
actinomycosis.
