Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exogenous farnesol in yeast-to-hyphae morphogenesis, and 
Saps (2, 4, 5 and 6) mRNA expressions by a Candida strain that does not produce endogenous farnesol. C. albicans was 
cultured in the absence and presence of farnesol at various concentrations (10, 100, and 300 μM), in proteinase induction 
medium, and then used to determine yeast-to- hyphae changes, Candida ultrastructure and to determine Saps 2, 4, 5 and 6 
expressions using q-TR-PCR and ELISA (for Sap2). Data demonstrated that farnesol greatly reduced the yeast-to-hyphae 
morphogenesis of a Candida strain that does not produce endogenous farnesol. Farnesol induced several ultrastructural al-
terations,  including  changes  in  the  cell-wall  shape,  a  visible  disconnection  between  the  cell  wall  and  cytoplasm  with  an 
electron-lucent zone between them, and the presence of electron-dense vacuoles. Tested on gene expressions, farnesol was 
able  to  significantly  (p  <  0.01)  decrease  Sap2  secretion  and  mRNA  expression.  Farnesol  downregulated  also  Sap4-6 
mRNA expression. These results demonstrated for the first time that farnesol modules Candida morphogenesis through a 
downregulation of Saps 2, 4, 5 and 6 expressions. Overall these data point to the potential use of farnesol as an antifungal 
molecule.

INTRODUCTION 

  Candida  is  a  fungus,  which  accounts  for  nearly  96%  of 
all  opportunistic  mycoses  and  is  the  fourth  most  common 
bloodstream  pathogen  in  North  American  and  seventh  in 
European  hospitals  [1,  2]. Worldwide,  candidiasis  is  associ-
ated  with  overall  severity  of  illness,  increased  rate  of  inva-
sive  interventions,  use  of  broad  spectrum  antibiotics  and 
parenteral  nutrition,  which  are  all  unavoidable  among  criti-
cally  ill  patients  [3,  4].  Candida  infections  lead  to  a  pro-
longed stays in intensive care unit and hospital which causes 
significant health and economic problems [5, 6]. Among the 
Candida  genus,  Candida  albicans  is  a  fungal  organism  that 
forms  part  of  the  normal  oral  microbial  flora  in  approxi-
mately  50%  of  healthy  individuals  [7].  C.  albicans  is  a  po-
lymorphic organism and can grow as yeast, pseudohyphae or 
hyphae;  each  differing  in  its  morphology  and  virulence  [8]. 
The yeast form is commonly associated with the  commensal

carrier  state,  thanks  to  the  innate  immune  function.  The  
disruption  of  the  immune  surveillance  leads  to  C.  albicans 
growth and morphological changes to  its hyphal form facili-
tating  tissue  invasion  and  pathogenesis  [9,  10].  C.  albicans 
proceeds  in  different  ways  to  invade  and  infect  its  host. 
These  include  its  ability  to  overcome  the  host  immune  re-
sponse  [11],  the  phenotypic  transition  from  blastospore  to 
hyphal  form  [12],  the  use  of  hyphae-associated  factors  [13], 
invasion-like  molecules  [14],  and  secreted  aspartyl protein-
ases (Saps) [15].  

 
Saps  constitute  a  family  of  10  proteolytic  enzymes 
known  as  secreted  aspartyl  proteinases  [16].  The  contribu-
tion  of  Saps  to  mucosal  and  systemic  infections  and  their 
involvement  in  adherence,  tissue  damage,  and  evasion  of 
host  immune  responses  has  been  reported  [17].  Sap2  is  es-
sential  to  C.  albicans  growth  in  protein-containing  media 
[17]. Sap1 and Sap3 are expressed during phenotypic switch-
ing [18, 19], while Sap4, Sap5 and Sap6 are expressed upon 
hyphal  formation  [20].  Sap1  to  Sap6  as  well  as  Sap9  and 
Sap10  are  involved  in  the  adhesion  mechanism  to  host  cells 
[21].  Although  these  10  Sap  proteins  are  produced  during 
infection,  their  induction  time  points  and  expression  levels 
occur  at  different  stages.  When  in  contact  with  host  tissue

and  cells,  C.  albicans  is  capable  of  growing  as  yeast,  pseu-
dohyphae,  and  hyphae.  Candida  density  is  one  of  several 
factors that influence hyphal growth [22]. Some studies have 
revealed that the population dependence of C. albicans mor-
phology  results  from  the  continuous  production  and  detec-
tion  of  sesquiterpene  farnesol  (3,  7,  11-trimethyl-2,  6,  10-
dodecatriene-1-ol) [23].  

 
Farnesol is a metabolic product of mevalonate/sterol syn-
thesis  in  eukaryotes  [24].  Farnesol  generally  functions 
endogenously; however, in C. albicans, this molecule acts in 
an  autocrine  manner.  Research  has  shown  that  farnesol  pro-
duced  in  situ  by  planktonic  C.  albicans  cultures  prevented 
biofilm formation [25]. The  accumulation of farnesol blocks 
the  morphological  shift  from  yeast  to  hyphae  form  at  high 
cell  densities  [26-29].  These  data  suggest  that  farnesol  may 
reduce  Candida  pathogenesis  through  a  downregulation  of 
yeast-to  hypha  morphogenesis  that  could  involve  a  modula-
tion of Saps gene expression.  The purpose of  this study was 
to  investigate  the  effect  of  exogenous  farnesol  on  yeast-to-
hypha  morphogenesis,  Candida  ultrastructural  shape  and 
Saps gene expression.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Farnesol Solution  

  The  trans,  trans-farnesol  was  purchased  from  Sigma-
Aldrich Canada Ltd. (Oakville, ON, Canada). Farnesol (1 M) 
stock  was  prepared  fresh  in  methanol  prior  to  each  experi-
ment.  The  original  flask  containing  farnesol  was  de-gassed 
with nitrogen gas after each use to prevent farnesol degrada-
tion  by  oxygen.  In  this  study,  farnesol  was  used  at  10,  100 
and 300 μM, These concentrations were comparable to those 
previously used in different studies [26].  

Candida Strain 

  We selected C. albicans (ATCC 10231) which  is known 
to  be  a  nonproducer  of  endogenous  farnesol  [30].  This  al-
lows  us  to  have  specific  effect,  if  any,  related  to  exogenous 
farnesol.  C.  albicans  was  cultured  for  24  h  on  Sabouraud 
dextrose  agar  plates  (Becton  Dickinson,  Oakville,  ON,  Can-
ada)  at  30°C.  For  the  C.  albicans  suspensions,  one  colony 
was  used  to  inoculate  10 ml  of  Sabouraud  liquid  medium 
supplemented with 0.1% glucose, pH 5.6. The cultures were 
grown  to  the  stationary  phase  in  a  shaking  water  bath  for 
18 h  at  30°C.  The  yeast  cells  were  then  collected,  washed 
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), counted by means of a 
haemocytometer and adjusted to 107/ml prior to use. 

Effect of Farnesol on C. Albicans Transition 

  To  determine  the  effect  of  farnesol  on  the  yeast-to-
hyphae transition, C. albicans (104 cells) was grown in 10 ml 
of  proteinase  induction  medium  (PIM:  2%  glucose,  0.1% 
KH2PO4, 0.05% MgSO4; adjusted to pH 4.0) supplemented 
with 10% (v⁄v) bovine serum  albumin (BSA, Sigma) as pre-
viously  reported  [31]  for  24 h  at  37°C.  Farnesol  was  added 
with  and  without  fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS)  at  various  con-
centrations  (10,  100,  and  300 μM).  The  cultures  were  incu-
bated  at  37°C,  observed  microscopically  at  6  and  24 h,  and 
photographed  to  record  C.  albicans  morphology.  To  calcu-
late the percentage of yeast cells that underwent the morpho-
logical  transition,  three  aliquots  from  each  culture  (n = 5) 

Décanis et al. 

were used to determine the number of yeast cells and hyphae 
by means of a haemocytometer and an optical microscope, as 
previously  described  [32].  The  percentage  of  cells  that  un-
derwent  morphological  transition  was  determined  using  the 
following  formula:  (number  of  hyphae  divided  by  the  num-
ber of yeast cells and hyphae) (cid:2) 100. 

Effect of Farnesol on C. Albicans Ultrastructure 

  C.  albicans  (106 cells)  was  cultured  in  Sabouraud  liquid 
medium in the presence of farnesol  at 10, 100,  and 300 μM. 
C. albicans cultured in the presence of 0.1% methanol and in 
the presence of 5 μg/ml of amphotericin-B (Amph-B) consti-
tuted  the  negative  and  positive  controls,  respectively.  Fol-
lowing  a  24-h  culture,  pellets  of  C.  albicans  were  prepared 
and used for scanning and transmission electron microscopy 
analyses. 

Scanning Electron Microscopy 

  C. albicans  cells  were  fixed  in  3%  (v/v)  gluteraldehyde 
in PBS (pH 7.4) and dehydrated in increasing concentrations 
of  ethanol  (10%,  v/v,  increments  to  100%).  A  drop  was 
placed onto a round glass  cover slip for critical-point drying 
(CPD  030;  Balzers,  Liechtenstein,  Germany).  The  sample 
was  mounted  onto  an  aluminium  slab  using  silver  paint 
(Agar  Scientific,  Stansted,  UK).  Sputter  coating  was  per-
formed  (S150B,  Edwards,  London,  UK)  and  the  image  was 
viewed  using  the  scanning  electron  microscope  model  
Jeol  JSM  6360  LV  (Soquelec,  Montréal,  QC,  Canada).  The 
experiment was repeated three times. 

Transmission Electron Microscopy 

  C. albicans  was  fixed  in  cacodylate  buffer,  pH 6.9,  con-
taining 1%  (v/v)  paraformaldehyde  and  2%  (v/v)  gluteralde-
hyde,  for  1 h  at 4°C.  The  suspensions  were  then  centrifuged 
and  dehydrated  in  successive  washes  of  ethanol  for  30 min. 
The  C. albicans  pellets  were  embedded  in  Spurr  resin  and 
ultra-thin  sections  were  obtained  (Ultratome  III,  LKB, 
Bromma, Sweden). These sections were then mounted onto a 
0.5% Pioloform (in chloroform)-coated 3.05 mm copper grid 
and  stained  with  3%  aqueous  uranyl  acetate  and  0.1%  lead 
citrate  prior  to  imaging  under  a  JEOL  1200  transmission 
electron microscope (Soquelec,  Montréal, QC, Canada). The 
experiment was repeated four times. 

RT-PCR  Analyses  to  Assess  the  Effect  of  Farnesol  on  C. 
Albicans Gene Expression  

Total RNA Extraction  

  C.  albicans  (105  cells)  was  cultured  in  the  absence  and 
presence  of  farnesol  at  various  concentrations  (10, 100,  and 
300 μM) in PIM supplemented with 10% (v⁄v) bovine serum 
albumin  for  24 h  at  37°C.  Cultures  containing  2 x 107  Can-
dida were  then  centrifuged at 110 g for 10 min, pellets were 
washed and suspended in 400 (cid:1)l of TES (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 
7.5; 10 mM EDTA and 0.5% SDS) and 400 (cid:1)l of phenol acid 
[33]. The suspension was vortexed for 10 s and incubated for 
45 min  at  65°C  in  a  water  bath.  The  suspension  was  then 
centrifuged using a microcentrifuge for 5 min at top speed at 
4°C,  after  which  time  the  aqueous  phase  was  collected  and 
400 (cid:1)l  of  phenol  acid  were  added.  The  mixture  was  incu-
bated for 5 min at 4°C and then centrifuged in a microcentri-

fuge  for  5 min  at  top  speed.  The  aqueous  phase  was  col-
lected,  supplemented  with  400 μl  of  chloroform,  and  incu-
bated  for  5 min.  Following  top-speed  centrifugation  for 
5 min  at  4°C,  the  aqueous  phase  was  collected  and  total 
RNA was precipitated using ethanol plus 3.5 M sodium ace-
tate,  pH 5.3.  Each  RNA  pellet  was  re-suspended  in  1 ml  of 
ethanol  and  centrifuged.  The  pellets  were  then  re-suspended 
in  a  low  volume  of  RNAse-free  water.  RNA  concentration 
was determined by fluorescence using Ribogreen (Molecular 
Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, USA). 

Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) 

  RNA (1 (cid:1)g of each sample) was reverse transcripted into 
cDNA  using  Maloney  murine  leukemia  virus  (M-MLV)  re-
verse  transcriptase  (Invitrogen  Life  Technologies,  Missis-
sauga,  ON,  Canada)  and  random  hexamers  (Amersham 
Pharmacia  Biotech,  Inc.,  Baie  d’Urfé,  QC,  Canada).  RT  
conditions  were  10 min  at  65°C,  1 h  at  37°C,  and  10 min  
at  65°C.  Quantitative  PCR  was  carried  out  as  described  
[33,  34].  Amounts  of  mRNA  transcripts  were  measured  
using  the  Bio-Rad  CFX96  real-time  PCR  detection  system 
(Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada). 

  Reactions  were  performed  using  a  PCR  supermix  from 
Bio-Rad  (iQ  SYBR  Green  supermix).  Primers  Table  1  were 
added to the reaction mix at a final concentration of 250 nM. 
Five microliters of each cDNA sample were added to a 20 (cid:1)l 
PCR  mixture  containing  12.5 (cid:1)l  of  iQ  SYBR  Green  super-
mix  (Bio-Rad)  and  0.5 (cid:1)l  of  specific  primers  (Sap2,  Sap4, 
Sap5,  Sap6,  and  ACT-1)  (Medicorp,  Inc.,  Montréal,  QC, 
Canada)  and  7 (cid:1)l  of  Rnase-  and  Dnase-free  water  (MP  Bio-
medicals, Solon, OH, USA). Each reaction was performed in 
a  Bio-Rad  MyCyclerTM  Thermal  Cycler  (Bio-Rad).  For  the 
qPCR,  the  CT  was  automatically  determined  using  the  ac-
companying  Bio-Rad  CFX  manager.  Thermocycling  condi-
tions for the Sap quantitation were 15 min at 95°C, followed 
by 45 cycles for 15 sec at 94°C and 1 min at 60°C, then 30 s 
at 72°C, with each reaction done in triplicate. The specificity 
of  each  primer  pair  was  verified  by  the  presence  of  a  single 
melting temperature peak. ACT-1 produced uniform  expres-
sion  levels  varying  by  less  than  0.5 CTs  between  sample 
conditions  and  was  therefore  used  as  a  reference  gene  for 
this study.  

Induction of Sap Protein Production 

  To  determine  farnesol’s  effect  on  C. albicans  Sap  pro-
duction, 100 ml of a 107 yeast cell suspension were grown in 
the  presence  or  absence  of  farnesol  in  proteinase  induction 
medium  PIM  supplemented  with  10%  bovine  serum  albu-
min.  Candida  cultures  in  the  absence  of  farnesol  and  pres-
ence  of  pepstatine-A  at  50 μg/ml  were  used  as  negative  (no 
Sap activity) controls. Candida cultures without farnesol and 
with  PIM  that  contains  or  not  methanol  served  as  positive 
controls,  whereas  the  cultures  without  farnesol  and  BSA 
were used as internal negative controls (no Sap production). 
Each  concentration  was  simultaneously  tested  in  triplicate 
(in separate tubes). These were incubated for 8 days at 37°C 
under  agitation.  Farnesol  concentrations  were  refreshed 
every  24 h.  This  relatively  long  experimental  duration  time 
has  previously  been  shown  to  be  required  for  sufficient  Sap 
production  [31].  On  the  last  day  of  culture,  the  supernatants 
were collected, centrifuged at 1200 g for 10 min, and used to 
determine Sap2 concentration in each sample by ELISA.  

Detection  of  Sap2  Protein  in  the  Candida  Supernatants: 
Competitive Binding Inhibition ELISA  

  Anti-Sap2  IgG  antibody  was  obtained  by  immunizing 
male  Balbc/c  mice  with  recombinant  Saps2  protein  [35]. 
Sera  of  immunized  and  sham-immunized  mice  were  col-
lected  after  21  days  and  used  to  purify  anti-Sap2  IgG  anti-
body.  Following  purification,  the  reactivity  of  the  anti-Sap2 
IgG  antibody  was  determined  by  ELISA  using  recombinant 
Sap  proteins  rSap1,  rSap2,  rSap3,  rSap5,  rSap6  (a  kind  gift 
from  Dr.  Bernard  Hube,  Hans  Knoell  Institute,  Jena,  Ger-
many)  and  native  Sap2  (Brenntag,  Denmark).  This  showed 
that  our  anti-Sap2  IgG  reacted  with  both  the  recombinant 
and native Sap2 and, to a lesser extent, Sap1 and Sap3. Anti-
Sap2 IgG did not react with other Saps. Anti-Sap2 IgG anti-
body  was  thus  used  to  measure  the  Sap2  production  by  C. 
albicans  following  treatment  with  farnesol.  Polystyrene  mi-
crotitre  plates  (Nunc)  were  coated  with  50 μl  of  5 μg/ml 
rSap2 in 0.06 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incu-
bated  at  4°C.  The  wells  were  then  saturated  for  2 h  at  room 
temperature  with  2%  BSA  in  Tris-Buffered  Saline  and 
Tween 20 (TBST). The plates were washed three times with 
TBST,  after  which  time  100 μl  of  each  incubation  mixture

(prepared as follows) were plated in duplicate and incubated 
for 1 h at 37°C. The incubation mixtures, prepared  in TBST 
2%  BSA,  consisted  of  serial  dilutions  of  rSap2,  starting  at 
500 μg/ml  (to  obtain  a  Sap2  standard  curve),  or  samples  to 
be titrated, which were incubated in polystyrene tubes for 1 h 
at room  temperature with an equal volume of anti-Sap2 IgG 
(diluted  1:75  in  TBST  2% BSA).  After  washing,  the  bound 
antibodies  were  detected  by  adding  alkaline  phosphatase-
coupled  monoclonal  goat  anti-mouse 
(Southern  
Biotechnology  Associates)  for  30 min  at  room  temperature. 
Substrate solution containing p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) 
was  then  added  after  washing  and  the  reaction  was  stopped 
with  the  addition  of  0.1 M  EDTA  pH  8.0.  Absorbance  at 
405 nm  was  inversely  proportional  to  the  amount  of  Sap  
present,  and  inhibition  results  were  converted  into  μg/ml  of 
Sap  by  means  of  the  obtained  standard  curve,  which  was 
linear over the concentration range used.

Statistical Analyses 

  Each experiment in this study was performed three times 
or more. Experimental values are given as  means + SD. The 
statistical  significance  of  differences  between  the  control 
values  and  the  test  values  was  evaluated  using  a  one-way 
ANOVA.  Posteriori  comparisons  were  done  using  Tukey’s 
method.  Normality  and  variance  assumptions  were  verified 
using the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Brown and Forsythe test, 
respectively.  All  of  the  assumptions  were  fulfilled.  Data 
were  analyzed  using  the  SAS  version  8.2  statistical  package 
(SAS  Institute  Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA).  Results  were  consid-
ered significant at p < 0.05. 

RESULTS 

Inhibition of Germ Tube Formation by Farnesol 

  As  shown  in  Fig.  (1),  germ  tube  formation  was  reduced 
in  the  farnesol-treated  C.  albicans  cells  compared  to  that 
observed  in  the  untreated  control  cultures  Fig.  (1A).  The 
inhibition of germ tube formation was significant at both low 
and high concentrations of farnesol Fig. (1B) and as early as 
6 h  after  contact.  The  inhibitory  effect  of  farnesol  on  the 
yeast-to-hyphae  transition  was  maintained  after  24 h  Figs. 
(1A and 1B). Only few, if any germ tubes were observed in 
the absence of BSA, either with or without farnesol (data not 
shown). The effect of farnesol against C. albicans  transition 
could be through ultrastructural changes. 

Effect of Farnesol on C. Albicans Ultrastructure Changes 

  The  aerobic  growth  of  C. albicans  cells  showed  typical 
yeast  cells  displaying  the  characteristic  bud  scars  (Fig.  (2), 
SEM,  Ctrl).  No  development  of  pseudohyphae  (chains  of 
elongated  unseparated  blastospores)  was  observed  in  the 
cultures  with  or  without  farnesol  or  Amph-B.  Following  the 
addition of farnesol, the external morphology of the cells did 
not  appear  as  smooth  as  that  of  the  untreated  cells,  which 
indicates  a  possible  loss  of  cytosolic  volume.  Indeed,  farne-
sol basically distorted the cell wall surface at high concentra-
tions (Fig. (2), SEM). Nevertheless, the cell wall of C. albicans 
cultured  in  the  presence  of  farnesol  did  not  resemble  to  that 
of  C.  albicans  treated  with  Amph-B.  To  confirm  these  re-
sults  we  performed  transmission  electron  microscopy  analy-

Fig.  (1).  Farnesol  modulated  Candida  transition  from  blasto-
spore  to  hyphae  forms.  C. albicans  was  cultured  PIM  containing 
or not BSA with and without farnesol at various concentrations (10, 
100, and 300 (cid:1)M) for 6 and 24 h at 37°C. After each time point, the 
cultures  were  observed  under  an  inverted  microscope  and  photo-
graphed. Panel A  showed morphological changes at 6 h. The num-
bers of yeast and hyphal forms were then counted. The percentage 
of  hyphae  was  obtained  by  dividing  the  number  of  hyphae  by  the 
total number of cells (blastospores and hyphae) in each culture. The 
means + SD relative values are shown in (B). The levels of signifi-
cance  were  obtained  by  comparing  the  percentages  of  yeast-to-
hyphae transition in the presence/absence of farnesol. (a), untreated

(d), treated with 300 mM of farnesol. 

resulted  in  notable  alterations  in  the  internal  morphology, 
when compared to control cells (Fig. (2), TEM). Non-treated 
C. albicans  cells  displayed  a  normal  cellular  morphology 
with  typical  dense  cytoplasm  and  a  distinct  cell  wall.  Fur-
thermore, untreated Candida showed continuous cytoplasmic

of  the  cell  membrane  as  well  as  a  loss  of  cell-wall  integrity 
(Fig.  (2),  TEM).  A  similar  effect  was  obtained  when 
C. albicans was treated with Amph-B.  

Farnesol Modulated Sap2, 4, 5 and 6 mRNA Expressions 

  As  shown  in  Fig.  (3),  farnesol  significantly  (p<  0.01) 
affected  Sap2  expression,  showing  decreased  Sap2  mRNA 
expression  at  all  of  the  tested  concentrations.  The  decrease 
varied  between  4-  and  6-fold,  compared  to  non-treated 
C. albicans  cultures  Fig.  (3A).  The  same  observations  were 
made  with  Saps4-6.  Farnesol  significantly  (p<  0.05)  down-
regulated  mRNA  expression  of  Saps4-6.  The  important  ef-
fects were obtained with Sap5 and Sap6. With Sap5, the de-
crease  varied  between  2  and  5  folds  Fig.  (3C).  With  Sap6, 
the decrease  was  about 10 folds following C. albicans treat-

ment  with  100  and  300  μM  of  farnesol  Fig.  (3D).  With  10 
μM  of  farnesol  no  effect  was  observed  basically  for  Sap4 
and Sap6. 

Farnesol Downregulated Sap2 Protein Production 

  Whenever  possible,  mRNA  expression  should  be  con-
firmed  by  using  protein  expression  analysis.  As  farnesol 
clearly  downregulated  Sap2  expression,  and  taking  into  ac-
count  that  Sap2  is  the  predominant  Sap  gene  produced  in 
vitro under most proteinase-inducing conditions, the effect of 
this  quorum-sensing  molecule  on  Sap2  protein  production 
was  thus  investigated.  To  do  so,  anti-Sap2  IgG  antibodies 
were  produced  to  determine,  by  means  of  competitive  bind-
ing inhibition ELISA, the concentration of Sap2 produced by 
C.  albicans  following  treatment  with  farnesol.  As  shown  in 
Fig.  (4),  Sap2  production  was  significantly  reduced  in  the

tween 4- and 16-fold and was dose-dependent. These results 
are  in  agreement  with  those  of  the  Sap2  mRNA  levels  fol-

on  three  separate  experiments.  The  levels  of  significance  were

DISCUSSION 

  Candida  virulence  is  not  limited  only  to  growth,  but  is 
also  mediated  by  its  ability  to  change  the  morphotype  from 
yeast to hyphae. In an experimental protocol that induce hy-
phae  formation  through  the  presence  of  BSA  in  the  culture 
medium, we showed that farnesol reduced, up to 10-fold, the 
Candida  transition  from  yeast  to  hyphal  forms.  These  data 
are  in  accordance  with  previously  reported  studies  [36] 
showing that farnesol (which acts in an autocrine manner on 
Candida)  blocks  the  morphological  shift  of  Candida  from 
yeast to hyphae at high cell densities [37, 38]. This was con-
firmed  by  in  vitro  studies  showing  that  exogenously-added 
farnesol  inhibited  germ  tube  formation  [39-41]  normally 
triggered  by  serum  [32],  proline  and  N-acetylglucosamine 
[24].  Studies  have  shown  that  farnesol  produced  in  situ  by 
planktonic  C. albicans  cultures  prevented  biofilm  formation 
[30].  To  these  we  should  add  the  present  study  showing  for 
the  first  time  that,  exogenous  farnesol  modulates  the  behav-
iour  of Candida  that  does  not  produce  endogenous  farnesol. 
Farnesol  may  therefore  be  a  key  player  in  modulating 
C. albicans pathogenesis. However, in a recent study, Weber 
et al. (2010) state that, farnesol may be involved in the viru-
lence aspect of destroying the epithelial cell layer of the host 
as  the  initial  invasion  process  [36].  Thus  additional  investi-
gations that include Candida, exogenous farnesol and human 
epithelial cells are needed.  

 
Farnesol  is  an  amphiphilic  molecule  known  to  solubilise 
model  membranes  [42,  43].  In  mammalian  cells,  it  affects 
membrane  ion  channels  [44]  and  in Staphylococcus  aureus, 

Farnesol Interaction with Candida 

The Open Microbiology Journal, 2011, Volume 5    125 

it  inhibits  biofilm  formation  and  compromises  cell  mem-
brane  integrity  [45]. We  therefore  suggest  that  farnesol  may 
modulate  Candida  growth  by  compromising  the  cell  wall 
and/or cell membrane as well as cytoplasm integrity. 

 
In  this  context,  we  performed  ultrastructural  analyses  to 
show that farnesol distorted the cell wall surface at high con-
centrations.  Farnesol-treated  C. albicans  displayed  highly 
vacuolated  cells  with  an  increased  granulation  of  the  cyto-
plasm.  Similar  alterations  were  observed  upon  treatment  of 
C. albicans cells with  Ciclopirox [46], Amph-B, and nisin Z 
[47].  However,  the  mechanism  involved  in Candida  growth 
control  by  farnesol  remains  to  be  elucidated.  This  may  be 
linked  to  Candida  interacting  with  its  environment  that  in-
volves  pH,  temperature,  and  most  certainly,  the  host.  Com-
promising  C.  albicans  cell  wall  and  morphological  changes 
from  blastospore  to  hyphae  could  be  through  Saps  genes 
modulation. It is well known that Candida pathogenesis may 
be  reached  through  Candida  growth  as  well  as  through  its 
yeast-to-hyphae morphohenesis. Specific Saps were found to 
be  preferentially  expressed  by  Candida  hyphae  forms  [20, 
48].  The  reduction  of  Sap  expression  by C. albicans  may  in 
fact  reduce  the  yeast  virulence/pathogenesis.  We  demon-
strated  that  farnesol  decreased  Sap2  mRNA  expression  and 
protein production supporting the role of Sap2 in Candida in 
fulfilling  basic  functions  in  relation  to  transition  and  patho-
genesis via  proteinase  [49],  and  the  effect  of  farnesol  on  re-
ducing  Candida  pathogenesis  through  Sap2  expression. 
These  data  are  confirmed  by  some  other  Saps  modulation. 
Indeed, Sap4-6 mRNA expressions were also downregulated 
upon farnesol treatment. This highlights, for the first time,  a 
clear  link  between  farnesol,  hyphae  morphogenesis,  and  hy-
phae-modulating  genes  (Sap4-6).  Our  findings  support  the 
usefulness  of  farnesol  as  a  potential  molecule  to  control 
Candida pathogenesis through Sap4-6 gene inhibiting. These 
Saps  were  previously  reported  to  be  involved  in  controlling 
Candida  transition  and  virulence  [48].  The  precise  interac-
tions between the different Saps and farnesol during Candida 
pathogenesis  remain  unexplored.  Further  studies  will  focus 
on  identifying  the  role  of  Sap  subfamilies  in  Candida  inva-
sion,  and  the  role  of  farnesol  in  controlling  Candida  viru-
lence/pathogenesis in conjunction with host defenses. 

 
In  conclusion,  this  study  demonstrates  for  the  first  time 
that  exogenous  farnesol  used  with  C.  albicans  that  does  
not  endogenously  produce  farnesol  downregulate  hyphae 
morphogenesis through cell wall changes and Sap2, Saps4-6 
mRNA  expression decrease. Overall results suggest  the pos-
sible use of farnesol as an antifungal molecule.
