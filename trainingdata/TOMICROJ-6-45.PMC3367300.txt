Abstract: The identification and analysis of the Pseudomonas avellanae mismatch repair system (MMR) were performed 
via sequencing and cloning the mutS and mutL genes and then analyzing the characteristics of the corresponding proteins 
studying their function and biological role in an E. coli heterologous system. In these studies, the P. avellanae MutS and 
MutL proteins were shown to localise at the nucleoid level, in a MutS-dependent manner as far as MutL is concerned, and 
were also able to complement the defect observed in both the mutS and mutL knockout strains of E. coli. In addition, their 
ability to form both homo and heterodimers between each other was shown by using the prokaryotic two-hybrid assay. 
Our results represent a first step to elucidate the MMR mechanism in plant pathogenic pseudomonads since the MMR 
genes were identified in P. syringae pathovars but there was no evidence on their action as effective repair products.

INTRODUCTION 
  Pseudomonas  avellanae 
the  causative  agent  of 
bacterial  canker  and  responsible  for  the  decline  of  Corylus 
avellana  L.  This  bacterium  severely  damages  cultivated 
hazelnuts  in  northern  Greece  [1]  and  central  Italy  [2].  The 
main symptom observed in the fields is a sudden wilting of 
twigs,  branches,  and  the  tree.  The  disease  is  particularly 
prevalent during the late spring and summer.  
It  was  reported  [3]  that  P.  avellanae,  isolated  directly 
 
from diseased hazelnut specimens in central Italy, showed, in 
some  cases,  a  colony  phase  variation  with  the  presence  of 
transparent colony variants (i.e., water drop-like colonies) on 
nutrient  agar  medium  supplemented  with  5-7%  sucrose 
(NSA). These variants appeared encapsulated, were possibly 
not pathogenic and did not induce a hypersensitivity reaction 
in  tobacco  leaves.  Reversal  towards  typical  P.  avellanae 
colonies  (i.e.,  creamy-white  colour)  was  also  observed 
following the re-streaking of transparent variants onto NSA 
plates [3]. 
  Van den Broek et al., [4, 5] reported that MutS-dependent 
in  Pseudomonas  
mismatch  repair  (MMR)  is 
sp.  PCL  1171  colony  phase  variation.  The  process  occurs  
via  the  accumulation  of  spontaneous  reversible  mutations  
in  the  regulatory  genes  gacA  and  gacS,  which  belong  
 

involved

to the  two-component system  that  affects the production of 
secondary  metabolites  [6].  Indeed,  mutations  in  the  mutS 
gene  increased  the  frequency  of  switching  from  phase  I 
(opaque  colonies)  to  phase  II  (translucent  colonies)  up  to 
1000-fold  for  the  high  frequency  of  mutations  accumulated 
in  gacA/S.  These  results  indicate  that  the  level  of  MutS-
dependent repair is a determinant for the frequency of phase 
variation.  
  On  the  basis  of  these  results  and  to  investigate  the 
characteristics  of  phase  variation  in  P.  avellanae,  we 
preliminarily  undertook  an  analysis  of  its  mismatch  repair 
system  (MMR)  by  identifying  and  analysing  its  mutS  and 
mutL genes.  
  Unlike  the  MutHLS  pathway  of  Enterobacteriaceae  
[7],  Oliver  et  al.,  [8]  showed  that  the  MMR  system  in  P. 
aeruginosa lacks the mutH gene. Only mutS and mutL genes 
are  present,  and,  as  expected,  their  alteration  is  associated 
with  a  “mutator”  phenotype.  Although  Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa  does  not  have  the  corresponding  E.  coli  MutH 
and  Dam  homologues,  and  consequently  the  MMR  system 
seems  to work differently, Jacquelín et al., [9] showed  that 
the mutL gene from  P. aeruginosa is able  to complement  a 
MutL-deficient strain of E. coli.  
  No  prior  studies  were  performed  to  examine  the  MMR 
system  of  plant  pathogenic  pseudomonads  and  all  the 
available  information  (i.e.,  mutS  and  mutL  gene  sequences) 
stemmed 
the  complete  genome  sequencing  of 
representative  species,  including  several  of  the  P.  syringae 
pathovars. Additionally, as expected, no gene homologus of 
mutH has been identified.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Bacterial Media and Chemicals 
  Nutrient  broth 
(Difco) 
supplemented with 5% sucrose (NSA) were used for bacterial 
culture and plating of P. avellanae. LB broth [10] was used 
for culturing and plating E. coli. SM (salt solution) was used 
for  bacterial  dilutions,  as  described  by  Miller  [10].  The 
antibiotics  used  (Sigma)  were  ampicillin  (50 µg ml-1), 
(30 µg ml–1),  and 
tetracycline 
(40 µg ml–1).  Synthetic  oligonucleotides 
nalidixic  acid

amplifications  and  those  used  for  P.  avellanae  mutS  and 
mutL gene sequencing are listed in Table 1.

Bacterial Strains and Plasmids 
  Pseudomonas avellanae and E. coli K-12 strains as well 
as all plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2.  

DNA Sequencing and Sequence Analysis 
  The  putative  P.  avellanae  mutS  and  mutL  genes  were 
obtained  by  PCR  amplification  performed  with  synthetic 
oligonucleotides whose sequence derived on the analysis of 
the P. syringae pathovars phaseolicola, syringae and tomato 
sequence  alignments.  Because  the  5’  and  3’  sequences  of 
both genes from these pathovars are strongly conserved, we 
used the first  and the  last 20 nucleotides of the P.  syringae 
mutS  and  mutL  genes  to  design  the  oligonucleotides.  The 
PCR  products  were  then  cloned  in  pGemT  easy  vector 
(Promega)  to  obtain  pGemT-mutSP.av  and  pGemT-mutLP.av 
respectively. 
  The  mutS  and  mutL  gene  sequences  from  Pseudomonas 
avellanae  strain  CRA-ISFN1  were  obtained  by  sequencing 
the  pGemT-mutSP.av  and  pGemT-mutLP.av  vectors  with 

Table 1.  Synthetic Oligonucleotides used in this Study 

Grenga et al. 
primers  1-7  and  1,  2,  8  and  9  (Table  1),  respectively.  All 
sequences were determined at BMR Genomics.  

Plasmid  Construction  and  Bacterial  Two  Phages  Two-
hybrid Assay (TP-THA) 
  Recombinant  plasmids  (listed  in  Table  2)  for  the  TP- 
THA  were  constructed  by  cloning  the  genes  of  interest  
in  pcIP22  and  pcI434  vectors.  The  DNA  of  the  P.  avellanae 
mut  genes,  obtained  by  PCR  amplification  using  specific 
oligonucleotides  carrying  the  SalI  and  BamHI  restriction 
sites  at  the  ends,  listed  in  Table  1,  was  cloned  in  the  same 
sites of the pcIP22 and pcI434 vectors, respectively [11]. All of 
the  different  combinations  of  recombinant  plasmids  coding 
for  the  chimerical  repressors,  obtained  as  described  above, 
were  transformed  into  the  recipient  E.  coli  strain  R721, 
which  carries  the  434/P22  chimerical  operator  that  governs 
the lacZ expression as reporter gene. β-galactosidase activity 
was  assayed  as  described  by  Miller  [10].  Bacterial  cultures 
were  grown  at  37°C  in  LB  medium  supplemented  with  0.1 
mM 
to  an 
OD600 of 0.3. β-galactosidase activity was evaluated for each 
strain  and  normalised  to  the  value  of  E.  coli  R721  without 
plasmids.  Residual  β-galactosidase  activity  less  than  50% 
was  indicative  of  a  protein-protein  interaction,  whereas 
activity  greater  than  50%  indicated  an  uncertain  or  null 
interaction.  The  rationale  for  this  cut-off  is  reported  in 
previous  studies  [11-13].  E.  coli  R721  with  the  pcI434434 
plasmid was used as a negative control and E. coli R721 with 
both  the  pcIP22434  and  pcI434434  plasmids  (Table  2)  was 
used as a positive control.

produced DNA fragments of the corresponding genes. These 
were  constructed  in  the  PstI  and  HindIII  sites,  downstream  
of  the  GFP  gene  previously  inserted  in  the  EcoRI  and  PstI 
sites of plasmid pTTQ18, to give the plasmid pTTQ18-GFP 
[12]. 
Fluorescent Microscopy 
  Cultures  of  E.  coli  KM75  ΔmutS  strain,  harbouring  the 
recombinant plasmids containing the genes of interest fused 
in-frame  with  GFP,  were  grown  in  LB  supplemented  with 
the appropriate antibiotics up to OD600 values in the range of 
0.3  to  0.4.  The  addition  of  0.1  mM  IPTG  induced  the 
expression  of  the  tagged  genes,  and  the  culture  was  further 
grown  for  1 h  at  30°C.  Next,  1  µL  of  4’,  6-diamino-2-
phenylindole  (DAPI,  5  mg  mL-1)  was  added  to  a  100  µL 
aliquot  of  bacterial  culture  for  10  min  in  the  dark.  The 
sample  was  then  centrifuged  and  resuspended  in  the  same 
volume of saline buffer. Finally, 5 µL were loaded on poly-

L-lysine-coated  slides  and  examined  using  a  Delta  vision 
(AppliedPrecision) Olympus 1 X 70 microscope.  
  The  P.  avellanae  and  E.  coli  MutL  localisations  were 
examined  in  the  E.  coli  KM75  strain  in  the  absence  and 
presence  of  P.  avellanae  MutS,  coded  by  the  pcI434mutSP.av 
plasmid. 
Complementation Experiments 
  Cultures of E. coli KM75 ΔmutS strain, transformed with 
pcIP22mutSP.av  and  pcIP22mutSE.coli,  respectively,  were  grown 
in LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics up to an 
OD600  equal  to  0.9  and  then  plated  on  LB  containing  40 
µg/ml of nalidixic acid. The frequency of nal-resistant clones 
was  compared  to  both  the  mut  deleted  strains  without 
plasmids and to the R718 wild-type strain. 
  The  same  kind  of  experiments  was  performed  with  E. 
coli  KM52  ΔmutL  transformed  with  pcIP22mutLP.av  and 
pcIP22mutLE.coli, respectively.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
  To  investigate  whether  the  characteristics  of  phase 
variation  in  P.  avellanae  reported  by  Scortichini  and 
Angelucci  [3]  could  be  related  to  an  alteration  of  the  
MutS-dependent mismatch repair (MMR) system [4, 5], we 
preliminarily  undertook  a  study  of  its  mismatch  repair 
system (MMR) by analysing the mutS and mutL genes.  
  Although  MutH,  MutL  and  MutS  are  essential 
components  of  the  mismatch  repair  system  in  Escherichia 
coli only mutS and mutL genes are found in most organisms, 
whereas  the  mutH  gene  is  limited  to  some  proteobacteria 
[14] and, in particular, Pseudomonas species  lack the mutH 
homologue [15]. In fact, no homologous sequence was found 
for the endonuclease MutH, necessary for cleaving the DNA 
strand  with  the  mismatch  in  the  E.  coli  MMR  system,  thus 
indicating 
is  probably 
that  a  different  endonuclease 
performing the cleavage in P. aeruginosa [8]. 
Identification of the Putative P. avellanae mutS and mutL 
Genes 
 
Since the complete genome sequence is not available for 
P. avellanae, the synthetic oligonucleotide sequences used to 
amplify the putative P. avellanae mutS and mutL genes were 
obtained  by  the  analysis  of  sequence  alignments  from  P. 
syringae  pathovars  phaseolicola,  syringae  and  tomato. 

A) 

Grenga et al. 
Because  the  5’  and  3’  sequences  of  both  genes  from  these 
pathovars  are  strongly  conserved,  we  used  the  first  and  the 
last 20 nucleotides of the P. syringae mutS and mutL genes 
to  design  the  oligonucleotides.  The  DNA  obtained  by  PCR 
amplification  from  a  culture  of  P.  avellanae  strain  CRA-
ISFN1 with the two pairs of oligonucleotides, 10-11 and 12-
13,  for  mutS  and  mutL,  respectively,  (Table  1)  was  cloned 
into the pGemT-easy vector and sequenced. 
  The  P.  avellanae  strain  CRA-ISFN1  mutS  and  mutL 
genes  were  entirely  sequenced.  The  sequences  were 
deposited at NCBI under the accession numbers AM982525 
for mutS and AM982526 for mutL. The two gene sequences 
were roughly similar in size to the corresponding genes of P. 
syringae pathovar syringae (i.e., 2601 bp compared to 2568 
for  mutS  and  1944  bp  compared  to  1938  for  mutL, 
respectively).  The  phylogenetic  analysis  is  enclosed  as 
supplementary data file. 
 
Screening  of  the  putative  MutS  amino  acid  sequence 
revealed that the main differences between the P. avellanae 
and  the  P.  syringae  pathovars  are  in  positions  367  to  373, 
where,  in  P.  avellanae,  an  insertion  of  seven  amino  acids 
(EPGARPR) is present. The putative MutL protein shows a 
96%  identity  to  the  P.  syringae  pathovars,  with  the  main 
difference  of  a  2-residues  (QY)  insertion  in  positions  
414-415.

Fig. (1). Structural domains of P. avellanae mismatch proteins. A) MutS: The aligned regions of the protein correspond: (i) with globular 
domain I (residues 12 to 124), which is involved in DNA binding. In this domain, there are two copies of the typical mismatch-binding motif, 
F-X-E, at positions 37 to 39 and 41 to 43 of the protein, as in P. syringae. In both cases, the sequence is FYE, as in E. coli, where only one 
copy is localised at position 36 to 38. (ii) with domain II (residues 132 to 257) defined as connector domain; (iii) with domain III or core 
domain (residues 263 to 572); (iv) in part with globular domain IV or clamp domain, which is also involved in DNA binding (residues 438 to 
528); and (v) with domain V, which contains a Walker A motif and is structurally similar to ABC transporter ATPase domains (residues 588 
to 801). B) MutL: For MutL, residues 43 to 129 constitute an ATP binding domain that contains two G-X-G motifs, present in the conserved 
domain of HATPase-C  and located in loops defining the  top and bottom of the ATP binding pocket. The transducer MutL_Trans_MutL 
domain  extends  from  residue  228  to  residue  349.  Also,  the  C-terminal  region  of  the  protein  (residues  456  to  601)  defines  the  MutL  C 
domain, which is involved in the homodimerisation of the protein.

The Open Microbiology Journal, 2012, Volume 6    49 

  A  search  for  conserved  P.  avellanae  putative  MutS  and 
MutL  protein  domains  using  RPS-BLAST  with  clusters  of 
orthologous groups of proteins [16, 17] revealed typical Mut 
family domains in both cases (Fig. 1). 

Study of the P. avellanae MMR System  
 
Since it was impossible to address directly to the question 
whether  the  two  putative  genes  identified  constitute  the  P. 
avellanae  MMR  system  by  generating  and  analyzing  the 
behaviours of the mutants, due to the lack of suitable genetic 
tools  in  this  organism,  to  assess  their  role  in  the  MMR 
system, we studied their behaviour in an E. coli heterologous 
system. 
  The  MMR  mechanism  predicts  that,  during  initiation  of 
DNA  mismatch  repair,  a  monomer  of 
the  mismatch 
recognition protein, MutS, after binding the mismatch on the 
DNA, homodimerises and then recruits MutL in the presence 
of ATP. The MutS (ATP)-MutL ternary complex forms and 
then further activates the repair process [reviewed in 18]. A 
consequence of this model is that MutL is unable to bind the 
DNA and therefore does not have the ability to localise at the 
nucleoid level in the absence of MutS. 
  To  reconstruct  the  MMR  system  of  P.  avellanae,  we 
studied the ability of MutS and MutL to interact individually 
and  in  combination, and  to  localise  at the nucleoid  level  in 
the bacterial cell. The complementation of E. coli mutS- and 
mutL-deleted  strains  and  the  study  of  the  P.  avellanae 
protein  interactions  with  those  of  E.  coli  (where  the  MMR 
system is well characterised) were performed to assess their 
effective functionality as DNA repair proteins. 
i) Interactions of the P. avellanae MutS and MutL Proteins 
between Each Other and with Those of E. coli 
  The  ability  of  P.  avellanae  MutS  and  MutL  to  form 
homodimers and to interact between each other was studied 
using  the  prokaryotic  two  phages  two-hybrid  assay  (TP-
THA) [11]. In the TP-THA system, the interaction between 
two  proteins  is  tested  by  their  ability  to  form  a  chimeric 
lambdoid  repressor.  When  the  gene  products  interact  they 
form a functional repressor that shuts down the expression of 
a  chromosomal  copy  of  the  lacZ  reporter  gene,  whose 
synthesis is governed by a hybrid 434-P22 promoter/operator 
region [11]. β-galactosidase synthesis,  which  is  constitutive 
in the strain without plasmids, is repressed in the presence of 
the two plasmids only if the two proteins under investigation 
interact  to  form  a  functional  chimeric  repressor.  The  β-

galactosidase  activity  of  the  E.  coli  strain  R721  harbouring 
the pairs of plasmids was evaluated and normalised to that of 
the  parental  strain  without  plasmids.  Residual  activity  less 
than  50%  is  indicative  of  an  interaction  between  the  two 
proteins [12, 13]. 
  The  two  P.avellanae  mut  genes  were  cloned  in  frame 
with  the  N-terminal  part  of  the  lambdoid  phage  repressors 
434  and  P22  in  the  pcI434  and  pcIP22  plasmids  to  form  the 
recombinant plasmids, pcI434-mutS, pcIP22-mutS, pcI434-mutL, 
and  pcIP22-mutL.  In  addition,  to  investigate  the  possible 
interactions  between  P.  avellanae  and  their  orthologous  E. 
coli  mismatch  repair  proteins,  the  E.  coli  mut  genes  were 
cloned in the same vectors described above. The assays were 
performed  as  described  in  Materials  and  Methods.  The 
results  represent  the  average  of  at  least  three  independent 
determinations.  
  The  β-galactosidase  activity  of  the  bacterial  strain 
without  plasmids  was  2300  Miller  units,  and  if  it  harbours 
only one of the two plasmids the residual activity was in the 
order of 100%. 
  The  results  (Table  3)  suggest  that,  as  expected  from  
the  behaviour  of  the  Mut  proteins,  both  the  P.  avellanae 
MutS  and  MutL  proteins  are  able  to  homodimerise  and  
also  to  interact  with  each  other.  In  addition,  although 
phylogenetically  different,  the  P.  avellanae  MMR  proteins 
were  shown  to  be  interchangeable  with  their  homologous  
E. coli proteins during the interaction analyses.

ii)  Complementation  of  E.  coli  mutS  and  mutL  Deletion 
Mutants by P. avellanae Mut Proteins 
  Despite the phylogenetic distance between the E. coli and 
P.  avellanae  MMR  proteins  (see  the  supplementary  data), 
the  MutS  proteins  alignment  shows  about  57%  identity  
that  is  mostly clustered on domains I and IV of the protein 

Grenga et al. 
(Fig. 1). The identity decreases to 41% when the two MutL 
proteins  are  compared.  In  this  case  the  best  alignment  is 
observed on the first part of the protein. 
  The sequence homology between the P. avellanae and E. 
coli  Mut  proteins  and  the  results  observed  in  the  TP-THA 
suggest  that  the  P.  avellanae  mismatch  proteins  could  be

functional  in  E.  coli.  For  these  reasons,  we  studied  their 
ability to complement  the defects of E. coli mutS and mutL 
deletion mutants. The E. coli strains deleted for the mutS and 
mutL genes show an increased mutation rate due to the loss 
of DNA repair. This phenotype can be evaluated by studying 
the mutation rate frequency of a particular marker, such as an 
antibiotic  resistance  derived  by  a  mutation  of  the  antibiotic 
target gene on the bacterial chromosome. In our experiments, 
we studied the frequency of nalidixic acid resistance in both 
the  mutated  and  wild  type  strains,  in  the  presence  and 
absence of recombinant plasmids coding for the P. avellanae 
and E. coli mutS and mutL genes. The results of these studies 
are  shown  in  Table  4.  The  frequency  of  nalidixic  acid 
resistance  increases  about  1,000  fold  in  the  ΔmutsS  and 
ΔmutL  strains  when  compared  to  the  wild-type  strain.  The 
defects  of  the  mut-deleted  strains  are  fully  rescued  in  the 
presence  of  recombinant  plasmids  carrying  the  E.  coli  mut 
genes.  Additionally,  the  presence  of  the  P.  avellanae 
proteins  can  rescue,  almost  completely, 
the  wild-type 
phenotype,  confirming  the  results  obtained  using  the  two-
hybrid assay.  
  These results indicate that the gene products identified as 
putative  Mut  proteins  in  P.  avellanae  are  effectively 
involved  in  the  MMR  repair  process  and  suggests  that  the  
P.  avellanae  Mut  proteins  are  interchangeable  with  that  of  
E. coli in performing the mismatch repair functions.  
iii) Localisation of P. avellanae MutS and MutL in E. coli.  
  MutS  localisation  on  the  bacterial  chromosome  at  the 
mismatch  level  is  the  first  step  in  the  repair  process  and  is 
followed by the recruitment of MutL [18]. The onset of the 
P.  avellanae  MMR  system  was  characterised  studying  
the  ability  of  its  MutS  protein  to  localise  in  the  E.  coli  
KM75  ΔmutS  strain.  This  design  was  chosen  to  avoid  any 
interference with the endogenous MutS protein.  
  As  shown  by  Fig.  (2A),  P.  avellanae  MutS  is  able  to 
localise  in  the  E.  coli  at  the  same  extent  as  the  E.  coli 
protein,  whereas,  according  to  the  MMR  model  of  action,  
in  the  absence  of  MutS  either  the  P.  avellanae  or  the  
E.  coli,  MutL  does  not  appear  to  be  condensed  in  foci,  
but  diffused  in  the  cytoplasm.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
presence  of  P.  avellanae  MutS  on  a  plasmid  allows  for  
both  P.  avellanae  and  E.  coli  MutL  migration  towards  the 
nucleoid (Fig. 2B).  
  The  ability  of  P.  avellanae  MutS  to  recruit  the  E.  coli 
MutL  protein  on  the  chromosome  is  consistent  with  the 
result of the observed interactions between the E. coli and P. 
avellanae MMR proteins.  

CONCLUSION 
  The characterisation of the P. avellanae Mut system is an 
early  step  in  the  study  of  its  possible  involvement  in  the 
colony  phase  variation  of  bacteria  isolated  from  Corylus 
avellana plants infected by P. avellanae [3]. 
 
In  their  whole,  our  results  confirmed  that  the  gene 
sequences,  caught  by  PCR  amplification  with  the  synthetic 
oligonucleotides  designed  on  the  P.  syringae,  correspond  
to  MMR  genes.  Moreover, 
the  coded  proteins  are 

interchangeable  with  the  MutS-L  proteins  of  E.  coli.  In 
addition,  they  represent  a  first  step  to  elucidate  the  MMR 
mechanism  in  plant  pathogenic  pseudomonads  since,  until 
now,  the  MMR  genes  were  identified  in  P.  syringae 
pathovars but no evidence on their action as effective repair 
products was produced.
