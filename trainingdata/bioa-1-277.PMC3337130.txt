Myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C

or C-protein) is a protein of the
thick (myosin-containing)
filaments of
striated muscle thought to be involved
in the modulation of cardiac contraction
in response to β-adrenergic stimulation.
The mechanism of this modulation is
unknown, but one possibility is through
transient binding of the N-terminal end
of MyBP-C to the thin (actin-containing)
filaments. While
such binding has
been demonstrated in vitro, it was not
known until recently whether such a link
between thick and thin filaments also
occurred in vivo. Here we review a recent
paper in which electron microscopy (EM)
is used to directly demonstrate MyBP-C
links between myosin and actin filaments
in the intact sarcomere,
suggesting a
possible physical mechanism for modu-
lating filament sliding. Molecular details
of MyBP-C binding to actin have
recently been elucidated by EM of
isolated filaments: the results suggest that
MyBP-C might contribute to the modu-
lation of contraction in part by compet-
ing with tropomyosin for binding sites
on actin. New results on the structure
and dynamics of the MyBP-C molecule
provide
into the
function of this enigmatic molecule.

Immuno-EM studies

Although MyBP-C was discovered
nearly 40 y ago,25 its function is not yet
fully understood. In the heart it appears to
be involved in the modulation of contrac-
tion in response to β-adrenergic stimu-
lation9,26,27; in skeletal muscle its role is
unclear. One way in which MyBP-C
might in principle modulate cardiac con-
traction is through connection to the thin
filaments. Interaction with both F-actin
and Ca2+-regulated thin filaments (con-
taining tropomyosin and troponin) has
been shown in vitro to slow F-actin
motility and to modulate the state of
thin filaments.16,19 Whether
activity of
such interactions occur in situ, or are
merely an in vitro artifact, has recently
been clarified by electron tomography of
sectioned skeletal muscle.24 Here we

Ig-like and Fn3-like, 10 kDa globular domains, ~4 nm in diameter. The cardiac isoform shown has
11 such domains together with a MyBP-C-specific “M-domain” (which includes 4 phosphorylation
sites), a 28-residue insertion in the C5 domain, and a Pro-Ala-rich region (PA).5 The skeletal isoform
is similar, but lacks the N-terminal C0 domain, the C5 insertion and the phosphorylation sites. The
C-terminal domains bind to the thick filament (LMM and titin),5 while the N-terminal domains are
capable of binding to actin and/or myosin S2. Mutations over the whole length of cardiac MyBP-C
lead to HCM and to date 197 HCM-causing mutations have been found.6

demonstrate MyBP-C links between the
two types of contractile filament. We relate
these results to observations of N-terminal
MyBP-C fragments bound to F-actin28

of the MyBP-C molecule itself.29,30

Three-Dimensional Organization

of MyBP-C in the Sarcomere

While the periodic distribution of MyBP-
C within the two central regions (C-zones)

of each half thick filament has long been
known, its organization in three dimen-
sions has
remained a mystery. The
narrowness of
the stripes suggests that
the elongated MyBP-C molecule (Fig. 1)
is oriented perpendicular to the filament
axis,

Deciphering
this
narrow, elongated, and labile protein in
intact muscle has recently been achieved
by 3D electron microscopy of exception-
ally well preserved specimens.24 Tissue
structure is conventionally preserved for
EM by chemical fixation using glutaralde-
hyde, a bi-functional protein crosslinker.
Major cellular components and organelles
are well preserved in this way, but fine
molecular details are usually lost. It has
been found experimentally that the best
preservation is achieved by cryo-fixation,
which can instantaneously capture 3D cell
and molecular architecture by the physical
process of freezing. Freezing is achieved
by “slamming” tissue against a polished
copper block cooled with liquid helium,
which vitrifies
them
without
ice crystal damage) within a
millisecond to depths of up to 20 mm.
Following vitrification, specimens can be
sectioned at
(cryo-
sectioned) then imaged in the frozen state
by cryo-EM.31 While this procedure pre-
serves native structure better
than any
other,
and technically
challenging. An alternative method that
yields excellent results is freeze-substitution:
instead of cryo-sectioning,
the vitrified
tissue is chemically fixed at low temper-
ature (e.g., with osmium tetroxide in
acetone) as the ice gradually dissolves.
This is followed by embedding in epoxy
resin and conventional
thin sectioning
(e.g., Padron et al.32). This is the pro-
cedure we used to preserve thick filament
3D molecular structure in sections of frog
skeletal (sartorius) muscle.33 Comparison
of the averaged Fourier transform of the
A-bands from several electron micrographs
showed excellent agreement with X-ray
diffraction patterns of living muscle, demon-
strating that we had indeed achieved high
quality filament preservation (Fig. 2).24

stripes in untilted sections (Fig. 2) suggests
that a large part of the protein is confined
to a thin disc at
the stripe location.
However, direct inspection of the tomo-
grams at
this location does not reveal
MyBP-C structure due to noise in the
tomograms. To overcome this problem,
we computationally extracted thick fila-
ments

Inspection of the averaged tomogram in
3D (using UCSF Chimera35) showed clear
“crowns” of myosin heads with a 14.3 nm
spacing (Fig. 3), long known to be present
based on X-ray diffraction patterns of
muscle, but never before directly visualized
in muscle sections. A radially extensive
envelope of density (MyBP-C) was seen at
every third level of heads in the C-zone,
corresponding to the location of the dense
(Fig. 2). While
stripes
MyBP-C appears prominent when visua-
lized by this surface rendering (Fig. 3A),
depiction as a density map reveals that it is
in fact weak and diffusely localized. This
becomes especially evident in viewing the
reconstruction from different angles (see
Movie S3 in Luther et al.24), which shows
that the intense stripes appear only when
viewed exactly edge-on. Analysis of the
tomogram shows that the bulk of MyBP-C
density is at high radius, further from the
filament backbone than the myosin heads.
The density emanates at a fixed point on
the filament circumference, has an initial
radial component and then veers to a more
circumferential direction, apparently mak-
ing contact with the actin filaments (white
in Figure 3B and C).

These observations demonstrate directly
that MyBP-C can indeed interact with
thin filaments in the intact sarcomere. We
conclude that previous in vitro studies of
MyBP-C-thin filament
interaction, and
the functional conclusions derived from
them, may be relevant in vivo. While the
binding of MyBP-C to actin in vivo must
be weak, in order to allow for filament
sliding during contraction, it could have
profound
consequences,
e.g., by sensing and modulating filament

phosphorylation of the M-domain17 could
contribute to the enhancement of cardiac
contraction that occurs
in response to
β-adrenergic stimulation. Binding to actin
could help to account for a long-standing
puzzle—how MyBP-C, with its restricted
location in the thick filament, can affect
sliding as a whole.
thick-thin filament
This would not appear
to occur via
interaction with the small number of
myosin molecules that are in contact with
MyBP-C; direct connection to actin could
explain effects at the whole filament level
straightforwardly.

While the tomogram clearly reveals the
extension of MyBP-C between thick
and thin filaments,
it does not provide
molecular detail on the binding to the
surface of either. Suggestive information
on the binding of the C-terminal end to
the thick filament has come from a 3D
reconstruction of isolated filaments, which
shows three 4-nm globular domains (coin-
cident with the MyBP-C stripes) running
longitudinally along the filament in con-
tact with titin.36 These may represent
domains C8-C10, known to bind to the
thick filament backbone; the rest of the
molecule is not visualized, presumably due

to its disordering in isolated filaments.
Fitting of our tomogram to the isolated
filament reconstruction suggests a simple
model for MyBP-C organization, in which
the C-terminal
four domains
bind along the thick filament while the
N-terminal half extends out and binds
to the thin filaments. This arrangement
argues against the organization of MyBP-C
molecules into a collar around the thick
filament backbone, proposed on the basis
of interactions observed between C5 and
C8 and between C7 and C10 in yeast 2
hybrid screens37; indeed there is no visible
evidence in the thick filament reconstruc-
tion for circumferentially arranged 4-nm
domains, even though the resolution is
clearly good enough to see such detail.36

Mode of Interaction of MyBP-C

with Thin Filaments

Structural information on the binding of
MyBP-C to thin filaments has recently
come from observations of actin filaments
decorated with expressed N-terminal frag-
ments. Based on neutron scattering data
from filaments decorated with C0-C1-m-
C2 (C0C2) fragments,
it has been sug-
gested that binding occurs by interaction
of the C0 and C1 domains with sub-
domain 1 and the DNase I binding loop
of actin.38 However, this work was per-
formed at relatively low ionic strength,
and depended on model building of
relatively low resolution data. Binding

the fragment; however,

has now been studied by more direct
means, using EM imaging of negatively
stained F-actin decorated with the same
fragment and under closer to physiological
ionic strength and pH.18 The larger fila-
ment diameter, together with alterations
in the Fourier
transform of decorated
clearly demonstrated regular
filaments,
binding of
its
location and mode of binding on actin
were not revealed as 3D reconstruction
was not performed. Reconstructions of
filaments decorated with a number of
N-terminal
fragments (C0C1 with part
of the M-domain, C0C2 and C0C3) at
a variety of
ionic strengths have now
provided this missing information.28 All
fragments showed MyBP-C density over
a broad portion of subdomain 1 of actin,
centered over the N-terminus, with the
longer
fragments extending tangentially
from the actin surface in the direction of
the pointed end. Molecular fitting with an
Ig domain atomic structure suggests that
C0 and C1 bind to subdomain 1, while
the M domain may bridge over subdomain
2 and possibly connect to subdomain 1 of
the adjacent actin, while the C2 and C3
domains appear to lie above the actin
surface (Fig. 4A). While this appearance
agrees broadly with the neutron scattering
model, the M-domain in the reconstruc-
tion appears to be attached to the actin
filament,
in agreement with solution
data suggesting that binding to actin
occurs primarily through the C1 and

M-domains.17 It is possible that the higher
pH of the neutron scattering experiments
caused the M-domain to dissociate. New
in vitro motility and optical trap experi-
ments localize the M-domain binding site
to a cluster of highly conserved arginines
within the first 17 amino acids of the
domain.19 These appear to be involved
in stereospecific binding of cMyBP-C to
actin, possibly by binding to actin’s
negatively charged N-terminus.

The most interesting finding to emerge
from the reconstruction is the apparent
steric clash between the C0 and C1
domains and tropomyosin. This appears
to occur when tropomyosin is in the low
Ca2+ (Fig. 4C) but not
the high Ca2+
(Fig. 4B) position, consistent with the
from neutron scattering38
conclusions
and from reconstructions of F-actin deco-
rated with C0 and C1.40 In vitro motility
assays show that thin filaments are slowed
by the presence of the C0C2 or C1C2
fragment under high Ca2+ conditions,
their velocity is
whereas at
increased.16 The reconstruction offers a
possible explanation. The absence of steric
clash at high Ca2+ could allow uninhibited
binding of cMyBP-C to actin, exerting a
significant drag on thin filament sliding
(consistent with a similar inhibition of the
sliding of F-actin alone). In contrast, the
competition of cMyBP-C and tropomyo-
sin for part of the same region of actin at
low Ca2+ could destabilize the blocking
position of tropomyosin, thus tending to

low Ca2+

an Ig domain atomic structure to represent each of the major domains in C0C3 suggests that C0 and C1 lie on actin subdomain 1, while the M-domain

motility. If comparable effects occur in
vivo, cMyBP-C might
thus contribute
(together with troponin) to the balance
between the low and high Ca2+ positions
of tropomyosin.28 It will be of interest to
test this model by directly determining the
effect of MyBP-C binding on tropomyosin
position in regulated thin filaments.

The reconstruction also shows a major
clash between myosin head and MyBP-C
binding (Fig. 4D). Because of
the low
stoichiometry of MyBP-C in muscle this
would be unlikely to have
a major
physiological effect. Phosphorylation of
cMyBP-C has been shown to weaken its
binding to actin, which may reduce any
effect of MyBP-C on thin filament activity,
and allow an increased rate of filament
sliding in muscle. This could be one means
by which β-adrenergic stimulation of the
heart (which leads to phosphorylation of
cMyBP-C) increases cardiac contractility.
Overall, these recent and earlier data
suggest a model
in which cMyBP-C's
ability to bind reversibly to actin provides
an internal load to myosin power genera-
tion in muscle, a load that can be
modulated by phosphorylation of the M-
domain. cMyBP-C’s potential interference
with tropomyosin position on actin sug-
gests an additional means of regulating
contraction.

Binding of S2 to N-Terminal

Domains of MyBP-C

the heads, which is thought

In addition to its actin binding capability,
the N-terminal region of cMyBP-C has
also been shown to interact with myosin
subfragment 2 (the initial part of
the
myosin tail, emerging from the junction
of
to lie
relatively loosely associated with the thick
filament backbone) primarily through the
M-domain.8-10 This interaction may also
play a critical role in actin-myosin inter-
action in intact muscle, regulated by phos-
phorylation of the M-domain,9 although
it would appear that this effect must be
qualitatively different from that involving
actin binding. The positioning of MyBP-
C at only every third level of myosin
heads in the middle third of each half
thick filament (the C-zone, Fig. 2) means
that only about 20% of all heads in the

filament are likely to be directly affected
by MyBP-C interaction.
In contrast,
binding of MyBP-C to actin, even in
a limited region, could have a global
impact, affecting sliding of
the entire
filament. In addition, if MyBP-C affects
tropomyosin position on actin, this could
be
a
substantial length of the filament, due to
the significant stiffness of the tropomyosin
polymer.41,42

along

While the work discussed above impli-
cated the M-domain in binding to both
actin and S2, a recent NMR study suggests
that sites on the C1 domain might also
serve such a dual purpose.43 Apparent over-
lap between putative N-terminal actin and
S2 binding sites suggests the possibility that
MyBP-C might switch between binding
partners in a defined way, possibly controlled
by phosphorylation of the M-domain.14,43

Flexibility and Disorder in MyBP-C

Fascinating new insights into the structure
of the isolated MyBP-C molecule, which
may help to explain some of its enigmatic
behavior, have emerged from two recent
biophysical studies. Atomic force micro-
in which the mech-
scopy experiments,
anical properties of
individual MyBP-C
domains can be measured, show that the
Ig and Fn3 domains that comprise most of
the molecule are stably folded, but capable
of unfolding under imposed stress, with
different domains having different unfold-
ing thresholds.30 The M-domain stands
out in being much weaker than the Ig and
Fn3 domains. It appears to behave like a
highly extensible spring, a property that
probably relates to its predicted intrinsic
disorder.30 What function does this plas-
ticity of MyBP-C serve? One speculation
is
load on MyBP-C
may affect its binding to or activation of
signaling molecules. Similarly, binding
sites for actin or S2 within the extensible
M-domain may be modulated by stretch,
becoming more exposed when MyBP-C
is under tension, and these interactions
may be further modulated by phospho-
rylation of this domain.30 The unusual
mechanical and structural properties of
the M-domain suggest that it may func-
tion as an entropic spring (similar to the
PEVK domain of titin), readily extending

that mechanical

with low applied force and relaxing back
to a globular structure when tension is
removed. It is speculated,
for example,
that such behavior could contribute to the
relaxation properties of the heart.30

to adjust

Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and
NMR spectroscopy have provided further
insights into the structural properties of
cMyBP-C in solution.29 The Pro-Ala rich
region between C0 and C1 (Fig. 1) is
found to be highly extended and flexible,
consistent with the
intrinsic disorder
predicted for this region of the molecule
(as well as the M-domain).30 This may
allow C0 to adopt multiple positions at
the end of the molecule, and potentially
allow even the small C0C1 segment to
extend sufficiently to span between thick
surfaces.29 By com-
and thin filament
parison with titin, which has a similar
combination of defined modules
and
flexible/elastic proline-rich domains, it is
suggested that this design of cMyBP-C
may enable it
to the highly
dynamic environment of the contracting
cardiac sarcomere.29
Inclusion of both
flexible
in the
N-terminus bound to actin could clearly
influence the overall transverse mechani-
cal properties of the cardiac sarcomere.29,44
Comparison of proline/alanine content
in the Pro/Ala-rich region of cMyBP-C
from different
shows a direct
correlation with mammalian body size
and inverse variation with heart rate.45
These differences may be important in
matching contractile
speed to cardiac
function in different species by differenti-
ally affecting crossbridge kinetics.45 Alter-
natively, differences
in the extensibility
of
the Pro/Ala-rich region may have
evolved to generate different distributions
of extended and compact states, depend-
ing on the mechanical requirements of
different hearts, possibly affecting the
rate of the putative switching of cMyBP-
C’s N-terminus between binding sites on
myosin9,11 and actin.29
