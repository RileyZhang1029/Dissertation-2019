It is generally accepted that resistance genes acquired by human pathogens through
horizontal gene transfer originated in environmental, non-pathogenic bacteria. As a con-
sequence, there is increasing concern on the roles that natural, non-clinical ecosystems,
may play in the evolution of resistance. Recent studies have shown that the variability of
determinants that can provide antibiotic resistance on their expression in a heterologous
host is much larger than what is actually found in human pathogens, which implies the exis-
tence of bottlenecks modulating the transfer, spread, and stability of antibiotic resistance
genes. In this review, the role that different factors such as founder effects, ecological
connectivity, ﬁtness costs, or second-order selection may have on the establishment of a
speciﬁc resistance determinant in a population of bacterial pathogens is analyzed.

Keywords: horizontal gene transfer, antibiotic resistance, founder effect, ﬁtness costs, genetic exchange community,
second-order selection

INTRODUCTION
Bacterial pathogens can develop antibiotic resistance either by
mutations, or by the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes from
other microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer (HGT).
Since bacterial pathogens were (presumably) susceptible to antibi-
otics at the time of the development of these compounds, it
is reasonable to think that resistance genes have been acquired
from non-pathogenic microorganisms. Indeed, the analysis of
Escherichia coli plasmids from bacterial strains isolated before and
after the use of antibiotics for therapy demonstrated that the plas-
mid families were similar, but incorporated resistance genes after
the antibiotic era (Datta and Hughes, 1983).

Since the resistance genes did not originate in bacterial
pathogens, the sources for these genes would be environmen-
tal microorganisms (Martinez et al., 2009a; Davies and Davies,
2010). Indeed, the fact that most antibiotics currently used in clin-
ics originated in environmental microorganisms (Waksman and
Woodruff, 1940) led to the proposal that the origin of resistance
genes are the antibiotic-producing organisms, where resistance
genes may play an auto-protective role (Benveniste and Davies,
1973; Davies, 1997). Recent work indicates that indeed antibiotic-
producing environmental microorganisms harbor a large number
of resistance genes that could be potentially transferred to human
pathogens (D’Costa et al., 2006). Nevertheless, the presence of
resistance genes in the environment is not conﬁned to antibiotic
producers (Aminov, 2009). For instance, the quinolone resistance
gene qnrA originated in the water-borne bacteria Shewanella algae,
which is not known to produce an antibiotic (Poirel et al., 2005).
Given that quinolones are synthetic drugs, the existence of these
determinants indicate the antibiotic resistance genes can have dis-
parate functions in their original hosts, in such a way that the
universe of potential resistance genes that can be incorporated
into mobile genetic elements is even larger than predicted from

the analysis of antibiotic producers. Support for this statement is
the ﬁnding of genes that contribute to intrinsic resistance in dif-
ferent bacterial species (Fajardo et al., 2008; Tamae et al., 2008;
Girgis et al., 2009; Alvarez-Ortega et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010) and
functional metagenomic analyses indicating that the wide dissem-
ination of a large number of resistance genes (D’Costa et al., 2006;
Sommer et al., 2009) in all analyzed ecosystems (including the
human gut) whether or not contaminated by human activities.

It would be expected that this diversity of resistance genes in
microorganisms, that can confer an antibiotic resistant phenotype
on their transfer to a new host might be mirrored by a large vari-
ability of resistance genes, acquired by HGT, in human pathogens.
However, the number of different resistance determinants found
among human bacterial pathogens is low in comparison to those
present in the different metagenomes. This indicates that the trans-
fer of a resistance gene from its original host to a human pathogen
might be constrained by different bottlenecks, as discussed in this
review.

THE TWO FACES OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE
DETERMINANTS: HOUSEKEEPING GENES AND
HUMAN-DRIVEN CONTAMINANTS
The existence of resistance genes in natural ecosystems, even those
without any record of pollution by antibiotics was reported more
than four decades ago (Gardner et al., 1969). However, detailed
studies on this topic are more recent. In the last years an increasing
number of studies of the presence of resistance genes in non-
clinical ecosystems have been published. Several are based on
non-culture methods for detecting resistance. Brieﬂy, two differ-
ent methodologies are applied; one is the search for any potential
gene that confers resistance on expression in a heterologous host
by using functional genomic techniques (D’Costa et al., 2006,
2011; Sommer et al., 2009). The other is the search for resistance

genes already present in human pathogens, usually by PCR, in
metagenomic DNA (Koike et al., 2007). Whereas, in the ﬁrst
analysis the purpose is to characterize any gene that can cause
resistance if transferred and hence study the potential natural
resistome of the studied ecosystem, the second type of study analy-
ses contamination by resistance genes already acquired by human
pathogen.

These studies thus provide different information. Functional
metagenomics serves to deﬁne novel mechanisms of resistance
(potentiality, see Martinez et al., 2007), but predicting whether
such mechanisms will be transferred to human pathogens is not
obvious (see below). Indeed, the fact that the origin of the antibi-
otic resistance genes currently present in human pathogens is
known in only a few cases indicates that deﬁning the environmen-
tal resistome is a needed but not sufﬁcient condition for predicting
the emergence of resistance. It is important to note however that
the ﬁnding of novel mechanisms of resistance can be a valuable
tool for the design of antibiotic modiﬁcations before resistance
arises (Wright, 2007; Martinez et al., 2011).

The analysis of the presence in different ecosystems (conta-
minated and pristine) of genes that have been already acquired
by human pathogens would provide information on the stabil-
ity of these elements, the reservoirs and the factors that enrich
their presence in nature. These studies can be used to evaluate the
risks for human health from pollution of natural ecosystems by
antibiotic resistance determinants, together with antibiotics that
serve as selectors of resistance themselves (Martinez, 2008, 2009).
This knowledge might serve for the identiﬁcation of interven-
tion strategies to reduce the impact of anthropogenic activities on
the enrichment of resistance elements, already present in mobile
genetic elements (MGEs), in natural (non-clinical) ecosystems
(Baquero et al., 2008). The relevance that farming and transport
of food-borne animals or pets (Guardabassi et al., 2004; Aarestrup,
2005; Moreno et al., 2008), as well as the transport of goods (Ruiz
et al., 2000), or human migration (Kumarasamy et al., 2010) may
have for the dissemination or resistance is well known. For these
processes, procedures for tracking the presence and dissemination
of resistance genes might be implemented. More difﬁcult will be
the implementation of such studies for analyzing the role of wild
animals in the spread of resistance (Gilliver et al., 1999; Livermore
et al., 2001; Allen et al., 2010). Important in this respect is the
ﬁnding of resistance in migratory birds that can disseminate both
antibiotic resistance determinants and infective resistant bacteria
all over the world (Middleton and Ambrose, 2005; Steele et al.,
2005; Simoes et al., 2010).

Between these types of studies are functional analyses on
the resistance mobilome, those resistance genes that are already
present on mobile elements, irrespective of whether or not they
have been acquired by human pathogens. The transfer of a poten-
tial resistance gene from the chromosome of an environmental
bacterium to a human pathogen requires it to be mobilizable
after its capture by a translocative element and its integration in
an MGE. This means that once the resistance element has been
incorporated in a mobile element, the possibility of its acquisition
by a human pathogen can be high, especially if this element is
present in the human bacterial population. Unfortunately, studies
on the environmental resistance mobilome are difﬁcult and still

rare (Szczepanowski et al., 2008, 2009; Moura et al., 2010; Parsley
et al., 2010).

ECOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY
The ﬁrst requirement for the transfer of a resistance gene is that
both the donor and the receptor share the same habitat. In the
case of pathogenic bacteria, the pathogens need not co-exist with
the donor, because a chain of microorganisms may link the donor
and the recipient. However, since acquiring resistance genes might
confer a ﬁtness cost (see below), the establishment of a successful
gene-transfer chain is possible only with positive selection for the
resistance determinant. In other words, unless resistance is selected
(mainly by antibiotics), it is unlikely that MGEs containing resis-
tance genes will be ﬁxed in the populations of environmental
microorganisms en route to human pathogens. Since the nat-
ural concentrations of antibiotics in non-clinical ecosystems are
much lower than at hospitals (Davies, 2006), only in the case of
pollution by antibiotics (aquaculture, waste disposal from cities,
farms, or industries) a positive selection for MGEs containing
resistance genes can be envisaged. Following this reasoning, it has
been proposed that the possibility of a given resistance gene being
transferred to a human pathogen will largely depend on whether
the habitat where the donor micro-organism is present close to
human-linked ecosystems (Baquero et al., 2009). For instance, it
would be rare for resistance genes found in deep soil allocations
(Brown and Balkwill, 2009) or at a glacial ice core (Miteva et al.,
2004) would be transferred to human pathogens. In contrast, it
has been suggested that ecosystems such as waste-water treatment
plants or farms, where human pathogens and environmental bac-
teria co-exist in the presence of contaminating antibiotic residues,
might be hot-spots for the acquisition of resistance genes by
bacterial pathogens (Baquero et al., 2008; Aminov, 2011).

Ecological connectivity is not restricted to the spatial distrib-
ution of microorganisms. For those microorganisms sharing the
same ecosystem, some of them are more prone to exchange genetic
material than others. The organisms that can share genes, have
been named as genetic exchange communities (Jain et al., 2003).
As stated in (Skippington and Ragan, 2011), “gene exchange com-
munities can vary widely in spatial extent, taxonomic diversity,
density of internal connectivity, and involvement of vector types.”
These communities usually share some plasmid (or transposon)
types and do not possess strong restriction/modiﬁcation systems
that would impede the interchange of DNA. As a consequence, the
entrance of a resistance gene, located in a proﬁcient MGE into a
well established gene exchange community might allow its spread
among different organisms and consequently ﬁxation in popu-
lations of bacterial pathogens. This spread will be modulated by
speciﬁc ﬁtness costs that preclude the stability of the gene in some
bacterial species.

FOUNDER EFFECT
By founder effect, we refer to the situation in which the ﬁrst
gene to arrive is the one to win (Baquero et al., 2009). When
there are several resistance determinants with a similar substrate
proﬁle, usually one prevails once transferred to human bacter-
ial pathogens. As we will discuss later, this situation can be the
consequence of differential ﬁtness costs, nevertheless, a certain

degree of serendipity might be the basis of the successful trans-
fer, spread and ﬁxation of a given resistance determinant. One
example of this situation is the TEM-1 beta-lactamase, which, fol-
lowed by SHV-1 and OXA enzymes, has been the predominant
plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase in Enterobacteriaceae for many
years (Simpson et al., 1980; Medeiros, 1997). The TEM-1 beta-
lactamase was acquired soon after the introduction of the ﬁrst
generation of beta-lactams for therapy, and plasmids coding this
beta-lactamase spread rapidly among bacterial pathogens. The
study of several different ecosystems has shown that there exist
a large number of beta-lactamases nearly everywhere, which can
confer resistance to the same antibiotics as TEM-1. Why then, has
TEM-1 prevailed in these pathogen populations? Antibiotic resis-
tance genes are acquired and maintained because of the strong
selective pressure of antibiotics. Once bacteria have acquired a
determinant that allow them to resist antibiotics, there is not
a selection pressure for replacement of the determinant already
present in bacterial populations. This situation can change if the
selective pressure is altered, for example when new antibiotics are
launched into clinical use (Livermore, 2009; Salverda et al., 2010).
Indeed, the introduction of beta-lactamase inhibitors and novel
beta-lactams for which TEM-1 presented low activity generated
two different processes: (i) evolution of the TEM-enzyme that
most likely occurred in clinical settings when bacterial pathogens
were exposed to the novel selective pressure (ii) acquisition of
novel beta-lactamase coding genes by human pathogens with novel
substrate proﬁles.

FITNESS COSTS
It is generally assumed that the acquisition of an antibiotic resis-
tance determinant confers a ﬁtness cost (Andersson and Levin,
1999), meaning that in the absence of selection, resistant bacte-
ria will be outcompeted by the susceptible ones. In the case of
genes acquired by HGT, these costs might be the consequence of
the metabolic load imposed by the replication, transcription, and
translation of the novel genetic elements. If this was the unique
cause of ﬁtness costs, the disadvantage of carrying one or another
resistance gene will be similar and the ﬁtness cost would not
constitute a relevant bottleneck in selecting one resistance deter-
minant over another. However, different studies have shown that,
at least on occasion, the introduction of a given resistance gene
does not impose a non-speciﬁc metabolic burden but leads to
speciﬁc changes in bacterial physiology. This may be the case for
AmpC beta-lactamase genes, which are infrequently found on Sal-
monella plasmids unless the plasmid also harbors the repressor
of their expression (Verdet et al., 2000) or elements that compen-
sate the biological costs associated to AmpC expression (Hossain
et al., 2004). It has been found that AmpC alters the physiology
of Salmonella, decreasing its virulence and hence a differential ﬁt-
ness cost that decreases the probability of dissemination of speciﬁc
gene among Salmonella strains (Morosini et al., 2000). This exam-
ple indicates that the ﬁtness costs can be gene-speciﬁc and do not
necessarily derive from a general metabolic burden. In this con-
text, those resistance determinants conferring high ﬁtness costs are
unlikely to be ﬁxed in bacterial populations because they would be
outcompeted by other resistance determinants which lower ﬁtness
costs (Martinez et al., 2011).

This reasoning must be however modiﬁed by the chances of
acquiring compensatory mutations (Andersson and Hughes, 2011;
Martinez et al., 2011). If a resistance determinant confers high ﬁt-
ness costs, but compensatory mutations are easily selected, the
probability of being maintained in bacterial pathogens is high. In
such cases, the location of the mutations is a relevant issue. If the
compensatory mutations occur in the chromosome, not in the
MGE, the acquisition of the resistance gene by a new host implies
a new ﬁtness cost, and as a consequence the spread of the resis-
tance determinant will be compromised. However, it the mutation
occurs in the MGE, the chances for spread will be enhanced.

SECOND-ORDER SELECTION AND MAINTENANCE OF
RESISTANCE GENES IN THE ABSENCE OF SELECTION
If the acquisition of resistance confers ﬁtness costs it is logical
to suppose that resistant organisms will be outcompeted by their
susceptible, ﬁtter counterparts in the absence of selection. How-
ever, some resistant strains present no-cost (Rozen et al., 2007;
Balsalobre and De La Campa, 2008) and even some resistance
determinants can be beneﬁcial under certain conditions (Alonso
et al., 2004; Maughan et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2005; Perkins and
Nicholson, 2008; Michon et al., 2011). Finally, some ﬁtness costs
can be compensated by mutations that do not impede to keep resis-
tance (Bjorkman et al., 1998; Maisnier-Patin et al., 2002; Paulander
et al., 2007; Lind et al., 2010; Shcherbakov et al., 2010). This indi-
cates that reversing resistance once established can be a difﬁcult
task (Andersson and Hughes, 2010).

Maintenance of resistance genes in habitats without a strong
antibiotic pressure is favored as well by second-order selection
processes. Antibiotic resistance genes on MGEs are usually in
association to other resistance determinants. This means that the
selection for one antibiotic will select for the whole array of resis-
tance genes present in this speciﬁc MGE. Furthermore, MGEs
besides resistance genes may carry other elements such as heavy-
metal resistance determinants (Baker-Austin et al., 2006), or genes
coding for production of siderophores, toxins, or bacteriocins
(De Lorenzo and Martinez, 1988; Clewell, 1990; Herrero et al.,
2008); these can confer an ecological advantage in some ecosys-
tems and thus co-select resistance in the absence of antibiotics.
Cross-selection might also be a relevant second-order process
that allows maintenance of resistance in the absence of selection.
Certain resistance determinants, such as multidrug (MDR) efﬂux
pumps confer resistance to different compounds (antibiotics, bio-
cides, or heavy metals; Martinez et al., 2009b). This means that
selection with the biocide or the heavy metal might result in cross-
resistance to the antibiotic (Hernandez et al., 1998; Sanchez et al.,
2005).

A ﬁnal mechanism for the maintenance of resistance is based
on the inherent systems for plasmid stability. Plasmids frequently
encode toxin/antitoxin systems, which provoke death of bacte-
ria that lose the plasmid (Hayes, 2003; Hayes and Van Melderen,
2011). If one such plasmid incorporates an antibiotic resistance
determinant, the probabilities for its maintenance will be high.

Taking these considerations into account, resistance genes
might evade elimination (Andersson and Hughes, 2011) in the
absence of antibiotics; indeed, resistance determinants present
in human pathogens have been found on identical MGEs, in

antibiotic-pristine habitats (Pallecchi et al., 2008) such as wild
animals (Gilliver et al., 1999; Livermore et al., 2001) and primitive
human populations without any known exposure to antibiotics
(Grenet et al., 2004; Bartoloni et al., 2009). These observations
indicate that anthropogenic activity has enriched for a small num-
ber of resistance genes in natural ecosystems and that this type
of pollution will be difﬁcult to eradicate (Salyers and Amabile-
Cuevas, 1997; Martinez, 2009). Supporting this notion, analyses
of soils sampled in The Netherlands from 1940 to 2008, reveal that
the abundance of different antibiotic resistance genes increased
during this period. This, in spite of the fact that restrictions on
non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in agriculture and in waste man-
agement procedures have been strongly enforced (Knapp et al.,
2010).

CONCLUSION
Research on antibiotic resistance has been mainly focused on bac-
terial pathogens isolated from infections or in clinical settings.
However, the fact that HGT-acquired genes originated in nat-
ural, non-clinically relevant microorganisms and that the ﬁrst
step in the transfer of resistance likely occurs in natural ecosys-
tems emphasizes the need to analyze resistance in non-clinical
ecosystems. Furthermore, the constant release of antibiotic resis-
tance determinants already present in MGEs located in human

pathogens, and in some circumstances associated with selective
concentrations of antibiotics, may disrupt natural microbiota,
which then serve as reservoirs for resistance genes. Non-culture
based methods have demonstrated their value for the analy-
sis of resistance in natural ecosystems. Among them, functional
metagenomics provides the means to identify novel mechanisms
of resistance independently of whether they will be acquired by
bacterial pathogens. On the other hand, PCR analyses for spe-
ciﬁc genes serve to deﬁne reservoirs and to study elements like
pollution in the dissemination and maintenance of resistance.
Functional metagenomic studies indicate that very few among the
resistance genes present in nature have been transferred to human
pathogens. Whereas the founder effect can provide stochasticity
to these acquisitions, other factors such as ﬁtness costs, ecologi-
cal connectivity, which includes the formation of gene exchange
communities, are relevant bottlenecks that serve to modulate the
acquisition of resistance genes by animal or human pathogens.
