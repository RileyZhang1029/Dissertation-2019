Background: Periodontitis is recognized as a complex polymicrobial disease, however, the impact of the
interactions among the 7001,000 different species of the oral microbiota remains poorly
bacterial
understood. We conducted an in vitro screen for oral bacteria that mitigate selected virulence phenotypes
of the important periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis.
Methods: We isolated and identified oral anaerobic bacteria from subgingival plaque of dental patients. When
cocultured with P. gingivalis W83, specific isolates reduced the cytopathogenic effects of P. gingivalis on oral
epithelial cells.
Results: In an initial screen of 103 subgingival isolates, we identified 19 distinct strains from nine species of
bacteria (including Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, and Veilonella dispar)
that protect oral epithelial cells from P. gingivalis-induced cytotoxicity. We found that some of these strains
inhibited P. gingivalis growth in plate assays through the production of organic acids, whereas some decreased
the gingipain activity of P. gingivalis in coculture or mixing experiments.
Conclusion: In summary, we identified 19 strains isolated from human subgingival plaque that interacted with
P. gingivalis, resulting in mitigation of its cytotoxicity to oral epithelial cells, inhibition of growth, and/or
reduction of gingipain activity. Understanding the mechanisms of interaction between bacteria in the oral
microbial community may lead to the development of new probiotic agents and new strategies for
interrupting the development of periodontal disease.

Periodontitis is an inflammatory condition charac-

terized by damage to gingival tissue and period-
ontal ligaments, resorption of alveolar bone, and
loss of teeth (1). The destruction of
tissue seen in
periodontitis is thought to be due to a combination of
factors produced by oral bacteria and the induction of
host inflammatory mediators. Although periodontitis is
linked to the presence of certain bacterial species, no
single bacterium is either necessary or sufficient to cause
human disease (24). In the periodontal pocket of either
healthy or diseased teeth,
there are many different
bacteria that coexist in close proximity to each other,
and it has been postulated that specific interactions can
modulate the effects on host tissue destruction. For
example, one well-described interaction between different
species of bacteria is in the formation of the biofilm
that coats the teeth and gingival tissues, where specific,

nonpathogenic bacteria may be required to start the
initial biofilm that allows pathogenic bacteria to attach
and cause disease (5, 6). Antagonistic interactions
have also been documented, most notably between
Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus gordonii in which
the former
interferes with the latter’s colonization
through production of species-specific proteases (7).

Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative asacchar-
olytic anaerobe that is a member of the ‘red-complex’
bacteria that have been shown to be critical species in the
development of periodontitis (8, 9). P. gingivalis expresses
a variety of virulence factors that
include fimbriae,
lectin-like adhesins, capsular polysaccharide, lipopolysac-
charide, hemagglutinins, hemolysins, outer membrane
vesicles, and various proteolytic enzymes that cause
chronic inflammation of the gingiva leading to tissue
teeth (1012). Although these

virulence factors are important
for the growth and
survival of P. gingivalis, some of these have also been
shown to assist
in the pathogenesis of other oral
microbes. For example, P. gingivalis gingipains cleave,
inactivate, and cause loss of activity of complement
factors, immunoglobulins, antimicrobial peptides, cyto-
kines (IL-6, IL-12, IL-1b, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma),
and chemokines (IL-8), protecting other bacteria in close
proximity to P. gingivalis from the action of these host
defense mechanisms (13). Similarly, P. gingivalis proteases
liberate amino acids from complex proteins as well as
iron from heme-containing compounds (hemoglobin,
hemopexin, haptoglobin, and transferrin) that can serve
as nutrients for itself or other nearby bacteria (14, 15).
Antagonistic activity of oral commensals or pathogens
against growth of other periodontal pathogens has been
described (4, 1619). However, the exact mechanisms of
interactions between the members of the dental micro-
biota that either ameliorate or aggravate periodontitis
are not well understood. Here, we show that specific
strains of clinically isolated oral bacteria can inhibit
growth and/or virulence of P. gingivalis in vitro. These
in vitro findings are a first step toward understanding
the potential contribution of ‘commensal’ oral bacteria
protection against periodontitis.

Methods

Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83 (ATCC BAA-308)
was cultured anaerobically in blood agar containing
tryptic soy (TS; MP Biomedicals) with yeast extract
(1 g/l), hemin (5 mg/ml), Vitamin K1 (1 mg/ml) and
5% sheep blood, or brain heart infusion (BHI; Beckton,
Dickson and Company) broth supplemented with yeast
extract (5 g/l), hemin (5 mg/ml), Vitamin K1 (1 mg/ml),
and l-cysteine according to standard protocols (13).
P. gingivalis was incubated in BHI broth at 378C inside
anaerobic gas pouches (BD GasPak Easy). Bacterial
cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended to
OD6001 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

Other oral bacteria were isolated from subgingival
plaque samples collected during routine cleaning from
20 patients who were diagnosed as having periodontitis
in the periodontal clinic at Tufts University School of
Dental Medicine. The protocol for sample collection
was reviewed and approved by the Tufts University
Institutional Review Board. Subgingival plaque samples
from the deepest part of three periodontal pockets,
including the mesial side of two single-rooted teeth, and
a molar tooth per patient were obtained. Upon removing
the supragingival plaque and isolation of
the area,
sterile paper points were inserted into the periodontal
pockets for 20 sec, placed immediately into BHI broth
with glycerol and frozen prior to use. Glycerol stocks

were streaked onto blood agar plates. Plates were
incubated anaerobically at 378C, and single colonies of
single isolates were selected and re-streaked three times
on blood agar plates to ensure purity.

and

Identification of clinical isolates
The identity of isolates was determined by 16S rRNA
sequencing. The 16S rRNA genes of the clinical isolates
were amplified using universal primers, primers 8UA
(5?-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3?),
907B
(5?-CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGTTT-3?) using the fol-
lowing cycling conditions: 3 min at 958C; 30 sec at
968C, 30 sec at 458C, and 1 min at 728C for 35 cycles;
and 10 min at 728C (20). The resulting sequences were
compared with microbial genome databases using NCBI
(www.ncbi.org) and BLAST2TREE (http://bioinfo.unice.
fr/blast). The most closely related species was identified
by percent sequence similarity. In cases where less
than 97% similarity was obtained, sequence analysis
was repeated using a second set of 16S rRNA universal
primers, 774A (5?-GTAGTCCACGCTGTAAACGATG-3?)
and 1485B (5?-TACGGTTACCTTGTTACGAC-3?) using
the same cycling conditions (20). The nucleotide sequences
have been deposited in GenBank (Accession Numbers
JF496718-JF496736).

Host cell culture
The
line OKF6/
TERT-2 (kind gift of Dr. J. Rheinwald) was cultured
in Keratinocyte  serum-free medium (K-sfm, Gibco)
supplemented with epidermal growth factor (Gibco)
and bovine pituitary extract (Gibco) as described (21).
Primary human gingival epithelial cells (HGEC) were
cultured in Progenitor Cell Targeted Oral Epithelium
Medium (CELLnTEC Advanced Cell Systems) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Bacterial and cellular cocultures
The effect of individual strains of isolated oral bacteria
on the cytotoxicity of P. gingivalis was determined by
measuring the ability of mixed bacterial cell suspensions
to cause morphological changes in oral epithelial cells
adapted from the method described by Shah et al. (22).
P. gingivalis with or without another strain of oral
bacteria were added to monolayers of OKF6/TERT-2
or HGEC primary cells at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 100. The cocultures were incubated in K-sfm
for 16 hrs at 378C in a humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2. Uninfected host cells or cells infected with
P. gingivalis alone were used as the negative and positive
controls, respectively. Cells were reviewed by blinded
investigators for rounding and detachment using an
inverted phase-contrast microscope at 200 magnifica-
tion (Nikon TMS) and scored on a scale of ‘’ for no
visible inhibition of cytotoxicity (complete cell rounding

‘’ weak inhibition (partial cell
and detachment),

(minimal cell rounding and detachment). We also tested
for wound healing in the presence of oral bacterial
isolates and P. gingivalis using the method described by
Furuta et al. (23). Monolayers of OKF6/TERT-2 or
HGEC cells grown in 48-well tissue culture plates were
wounded by scratching with a pipet tip and infected as
above. The cells were examined by blinded investigators
after 16 hrs and scored for growth of cells into the
wounded area. Experiments were performed two times
in duplicate.

benzoyl-arginine

Assay for inhibition of gingipain activity
Determination of the effects of microbial interactions
on gingipain production of P. gingivalis was performed
using a modification of the strategy described by Bakri
& Douglas (24). First, we measured the effects of
coculturing P. gingivalis with individual isolated strains
on the resulting gingipain activity of
the bacterial
cultures. Briefly, P. gingivalis was grown anaerobically
in BHI, while bacterial strains to be tested were anaero-
bically grown in TS broth for 48 hrs. Each bacterial
culture (10 ml) was mixed with P. gingivalis culture (10 ml)
and further incubated in BHI broth for 24 hrs. Combined
cultures (20 ml) were mixed with the arginine-gingipain
substrate
(BANA,
440 mg/ml) in 100 mM TrisHCl buffer (with 2 mm
dithiothreitol), incubated at 378C for 2 hrs, and centri-
fuged to remove bacterial cells. Fast Blue BB detection
solution (350 mg/ml Diazotized 4?-amino-2?,5?-diethoxy-
benzanilide zinc chloride salt in ethylene glycol, MP
Biomedicals) was added as a coupling reagent to bind
napthylamine liberated by the action of gingipains, and
the optical density at 490 nm was measured after 30 min
using a spectrophotometer. To assess the effects of
independently cultured bacterial strains on the gingipain
activity of P. gingivalis, bacterial cultures (10 ml) grown
anaerobically to stationary phase in TS broth were mixed
with P. gingivalis culture (10 ml) of BANA substrate, and
immediately processed as described above. Assays were
performed three times in triplicate.

naphthylamide

Assays for inhibition of P. gingivalis growth
Determination of the capacity of isolated strains of
oral bacteria to inhibit growth of P. gingivalis was
performed by plating P. gingivalis from an overnight
BHI broth culture (100 ml) onto a blood agar plate
(16). Overnight broth cultures of the individual clinical
isolates of nonP. gingivalis bacteria (10 ml) were spotted
on blood agar plates containing the lawn of P. gingivalis.
Inhibitory activity was determined by measuring
the zone of inhibition between the tested strains and
P. gingivalis lawn after 72 hrs of anaerobic incubation
at 378C. Inhibition experiments were also performed

using UV-killed bacteria (resuspended to OD6001 in
PBS and spotted on the P. gingivalis lawn) and bacteria-
free supernatants (10 ml aliquots deposited onto round
wells cut into the agar plate and allowed to diffuse
before inoculation with P. gingivalis). Experiments were
performed three times in triplicate.

strains

Assays for acid production
Identification of
that produce organic acid
metabolites was performed by incubating the clinical
strains anaerobically in TS broth containing 2.5 g/l of
glucose, at 378C for 48 hrs. The pH of broth cultures was
measured using Hydrion pH papers (range of 3.58.0,
Microlab Essentials). Experiments were performed three
times in triplicate.

Assay for production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
Testing for H2O2 production by selected oral bacterial
isolates was performed using two different assays: (1)
alpha hemolysis of red blood cells and (2) a hydrogen
peroxide colorimetric assay. Hundred microliters of an
overnight culture of P. gingivalis were spread onto the
surface of blood agar plates. After drying, 10 ml of
overnight broth cultures of isolates to be tested were
spotted on the plates, which were then incubated
anaerobically at 378C for 72 hrs, and observed for
alpha hemolysis. Hemolysis was recorded as either
present () or absent ().

For quantitative measurements of H2O2 production,
TS broth cultures (15 ml of each isolate) was mixed with
Hydrogen Peroxide Substrate Solution (85 ml) containing
ferrous iron and xylenol orange (Hydrogen Peroxide
Assay Kit, National Diagnostics). The mixture was
incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The OD595
was measured for each sample and compared with a
standard curve. Standards were prepared from two-fold
dilutions of 0.015% H2O2. The limit of detection of the
assay was 15 ng/ml of H2O2. Experiments were per-
formed three times in triplicate.

Results

Effects of clinical isolates on P. gingivalis-induced
changes in host cells
We isolated a total of 103 strict and facultative anaerobic
bacteria representing 26 different bacterial species from
20 subjects with periodontitis (Table 1). The majority of
the isolates were identified to be Gram-positive species by
16S rRNA sequencing. Although Streptococcus and
Actinomyces were the predominant genera identified,
the nature of
the plaque sample, media type, and
incubation conditions are likely to have influenced the
species of bacteria isolated. We sought to determine
whether any of these bacteria may have an effect on
virulence of the pathogenic bacteria, P. gingivalis. We

Inhibition of Pg cytotoxicity was evaluated using an in vitro cell-rounding assay. OKF6/Tert-2 cells exposed for 16 hrs to Pg (MOI100)
showed complete rounding and detachment upon microscopic observation. The effects of coincubation with isolates on Pg cytotoxicity
were scored as follows: ‘’ no visible inhibition (complete cell rounding and detachment), ‘’ weak inhibition (partial cell rounding and
detachment), and ‘’ strong inhibition (minimal cell rounding and detachment). The table describes the number of isolates within each
species of bacteria that inhibited P. gingivalis cytotoxicity. The assay was performed in duplicate and confirmed in at least two
independent experiments. A total of 103 clinical strains were analyzed.

used two in vitro models of P. gingivalis  host cell
interaction. First, we used a cellular cytotoxicity assay
(22, 25) where P. gingivalis (strain W83) was added to
confluent cell cultures resulting in morphological changes
in both the oral epithelial cell line OKF6/TERT-2 and
in HGEC. These changes included loss of adhesion,
cell rounding, and detachment (Fig. 1A). We also used a
wound-healing model (23) where confluent cell cultures
of OKF6/TERT-2 or HGEC were injured by creating
a linear streak. Wounded cells that were not exposed to

P. gingivalis repaired the gap and fully recovered within
12 hrs. In contrast, cells treated with P. gingivalis showed
greatly impaired ability to grow and repair the wound
(Fig. 1B).

To determine whether the presence of commensal
oral bacteria could modify the host cell effects induced
by P. gingivalis, individual clinical isolates were added
to cocultures of P. gingivalis and oral
epithelial
cells. Differences in cytotoxicity were observed upon
the coinfections of host cells with combinations of

are shown for the cytotoxicity assay. Results for the
wound-healing model were in agreement with the cyto-
toxicity assay (a representative result is shown in Fig. 1).
Nineteen clinical isolates that weakly or strongly reduced
the cytotoxic effects of P. gingivalis were identified and
selected for further study. Not all strains from a specific
species of bacteria showed similar effects on P. gingivalis
cytotoxicity. Of note, not all bacteria grew equally well
under these conditions; although we added equivalent
numbers of bacteria at the beginning of the assay, some
bacterial strains grew to a higher density by the end of the
assay. P. gingivalis, which is an anaerobic bacterium,
survived but did not show growth under these conditions
(as determined by plating of the cocultures on blood agar
plates after incubation). There was no direct correlation
between growth of the commensal bacteria and inhibition
of P. gingivalis cytotoxicity, suggesting that inhibition by
the 19 isolates cannot be explained solely on the basis of
competition for nutrients.

Effects of clinical isolates on gingipain activity
of P. gingivalis
We next sought to identify mechanisms by which the
subset of 19 clinical isolates could affect the ability of
in host cells. Cell
P. gingivalis
detachment, cell adhesion molecule cleavage, and apop-
tosis have been attributed to gingipains, the trypsin-like
cysteine proteases produced by P. gingivalis (26, 27).
We cocultured the 19 bacterial strains identified above
with P. gingivalis W83 and measured arginine-gingipain
(Rgp) activity using the BANA substrate test. We
found that 5 of 19 strains showed statistically signifi-
cant inhibition of gingipain activity by greater than
25% when cocultured simultaneously with P. gingivalis
(Table 2). Six strains also showed inhibition of gingipain

activity when cultured separately from P. gingivalis. When
cultures of these bacteria were mixed with cultures of
P. gingivalis and analyzed immediately, there was also
decreased Rgp activity, suggesting that the inhibition
of gingipains by these strains occurs through mecha-
nisms that involve direct inhibition of gingipain activity
(Table 2).

Effects of clinical isolates on growth of P. gingivalis
Another potential mechanism by which interactions
between clinical isolates may modulate the cytotoxicity
caused by P. gingivalis is through affecting bacterial
replication. The ability of the 19 isolated strains to affect
the growth of P. gingivalis was investigated by agar plate
assay (16). Four Actinomyces naeslundii
isolates, one
Streptococcus Intermedius, and one Streptococcus oralis
inhibited the growth of P. gingivalis as determined by
a zone of inhibition when grown on a lawn of P. gingivalis
on blood agar plates (Fig. 2). The inhibitory properties of
these strains appeared to require active bacterial growth
or the presence of outer membrane components that
may be affected by UV exposure because neither cell-free
supernatants nor UV-killed cells affected P. gingivalis
growth.

Acid production by clinical isolates
Production of acid is a mechanism used by some oral
bacteria to control the growth of other bacteria (28).
We determined the acid -producing ability of the 19
strains of bacteria identified as inhibitory to P. gingivalis
cytotoxicity (Table 2). Thirteen strains were shown to
be acid producers in broth cultures,
including seven
strains that reduced the pH of the media to less than
6.0. All 8 A. naeslundii isolates tested positive for acid
production. Among the 6 Streptococcus strains studied,

Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) total gingipain activity was assayed by incubating Pg and each of 19 oral bacterial strains (identified in
Table 1 as inhibitory to Pg cytotoxicity) with BANA substrate and observing the change in color upon the addition of Fast Blue BB
detection solution. The oral bacteria were either cocultured with P. gingivalis for 1 day or cultured independently and mixed with Pg
immediately prior to the assay. The OD490nm of the reaction mixtures was measured and expressed as percent activity compared to
Pg alone. Statistically significant ( P0.01) effects of clinical isolates on gingipain activity compared to Pg alone when analyzed using

180B lowered the pH of the cultures to less than 6.5.
All but one strain that
inhibited the growth of
P. gingivalis reduced culture pH to less than 6.0 and the
one strain that did not was also shown to be a producer
of H2O2 (see below). There was a statistically significant
relationship between the ability to produce acid and the
ability to inhibit the growth of P. gingivalis (P0.044,
Fisher’s Exact Test).

H2O2 production by clinical isolates
Production of reactive oxygen species through the gen-
eration of H2O2 is another mechanism used by bacteria
to control growth of other bacteria (29, 30). Five of the 19
inhibitory isolates were H2O2 producers in broth cultures
(Table 2). Two strains of A. naeslundii, a S. mitis strain
and a S. oralis strain, were identified as H2O2 producers.
Only one of these strains was capable of inhibiting the

growth of P. gingivalis (S. oralis 180B), whereas none of
the other strains, including the highest H2O2-producing
strain, showed any inhibition of P. gingivalis growth. No
significant association was observed between the ability
to produce H2O2 and the inhibition of growth of
P. gingivalis. There was a statistically significant relation-
ship between the ability to produce H2O2 and the
ability to inhibit Rgp activity of P. gingivalis when
cultured separately and mixed and analyzed immediately
(P0.017, Fisher’s Exact Test).

Discussion

Identification of interspecies interactions affecting Porphyromonas gingivalis

Fig. 2. Effect of oral bacterial isolates on Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) growth. Broth cultures of 19 clinical strains identiﬁed
as inhibitory to Pg cytotoxicity were spotted on blood agar inoculated with a lawn of Pg and incubated anaerobically at
378C for 48 hrs. The growth of Pg was inhibited near the colonies of 6 of 19 strains including (A) Streptococcus intermedius
and Actinomyces naeslundii. (B) Growth inhibition was measured as the size of the clear zone (in mm) between the edge of the
colony and the lawn of P. gingivalis. Bars represent the average of triplicate measurements conﬁrmed in three independent
experiments. Abbreviations used: An, Actinomyces naeslundii; Pa, Propionibacterium acnes; Si, Streptococcus intermedius;
Smi, Streptococcus mitis; Sc, Streptococcus constellatus; So, Streptococcus oralis; Streptococcus sanguinis; Vd, Veillonella dispar.

disease is just beginning to be understood. In this study,
we used P. gingivalis-induced cytotoxicity as a model to
study how interspecies interactions influence the viru-
lence potential of a periodontal pathogen in vitro. Of the
over 100 bacterial isolates tested, we identified 19 strains
from 8 different species of bacteria that were able to
weakly or strongly inhibit host cell rounding and detach-
ment mediated by P. gingivalis W83, a virulent strain in
animal models of infection (32). Previous studies have
shown that the cytotoxicity assays we utilized measured
a mixture of P. gingivalis virulence components’ effects on
cells, including but not limited to, expression/activity of
proteases
invasion, end-product
metabolite production, the effects of cell surface compo-
nents such as lipopolysaccharides and fimbriae, and the
ability to induce apoptosis (33). We choose to start
with a cytotoxicity screen that is affected by multiple
different interactions because we felt that it was likely
that different microbes may involve multiple factors and
affect different pathways in coculture conditions.

such as gingipains,

The ability to inhibit the host-cell effects of P. gingivalis
was spread among several bacterial species that belong
to the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, notably of
the genera Actinomyces, Streptococcus, and Veillonella.
Actinobacteria and Firmicutes are known to precede

P. gingivalis in oral biofilm colonization (34). Interest-
ingly, even within species of bacteria, not all strains
were similarly capable of blocking the effects of
P. gingivalis on host cells, suggesting that
there is
strain-to-strain variability in interactions
significant
with P. gingivalis. This has implications for future studies
of interspecies interactions between bacteria as it can-
not be assumed that all members of a certain species of
bacteria, observed as ‘inhibitory’ to one type of patho-
genic bacteria, are always inhibitory. Until the genes
associated with the inhibitory functions of a particular
strain are identified, the determination of the inhibitory
capacity of each specific strain will need to be tested
phenotypically. Furthermore, given the differences in the
expression of virulence factors between known laboratory
and clinical isolates of P. gingivalis, it is likely that some
of the bacteria that inhibit P. gingivalis strain W83, may
not inhibit cytotoxicity of other P. gingivalis strains. In
limited testing of other strains of P. gingivalis, we have
found that some of the inhibitory strains also inhibit
cytotoxicity of
these strains, whereas others do not
(unpublished data, E. Tenorio).

Although the goal of this study was not to provide
an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of inhibi-
tion of P. gingivalis toxicity by individual
isolates,

is known for producing an array of
P. gingivalis
proteolytic enzymes (as many as 46 different proteases)
that are important in tissue destruction, activation of
host matrix-metalloproteinases, and immunomodulation
(35). Gingipains (encoded by the genes rgpA, rgpB, and
kgp) are the major proteolytic enzymes of P. gingivalis
and have been linked to the severity of periodontal
disease (35). Gingipains are a major class of virulence
factors linked to the destruction of periodontal tissues,
alveolar bone loss, and modulation of the host immune
system (36, 37). In addition, gingipains are involved
in the adherence of P. gingivalis to other bacteria
and human epithelial cells (38). Gingipain-specific in-
hibitors have been shown to suppress the pathogenicity of
P. gingivalis in vitro (39). In this study, we identified
strains of Actinomyces and Streptococcus genera that
affected arginine-gingipain activity. These strains were
nonidentical to the strains that inhibited P. gingivalis
growth, suggesting that for at least a portion of the
strains, the inhibition of gingipain activity was separate
from the effects on growth. A subset of the strains studied
inhibited gingipain activity when cocultured simulta-
neously with P. gingivalis, whereas others showed inhibi-
tion when cultured separately from P. gingivalis and
mixed and analyzed immediately. Interestingly, many
were not the same strains that inhibited in coculture,
suggesting that they may have different mechanisms of
inhibition. For example, those strains that inhibit in
coculture may be acting by suppressing the growth of
P. gingivalis or gingipain expression by direct interac-
tion between the organisms resulting in decreased pro-
duction of gingipains. Those that act immediately may be
producing an inhibitor of gingipains. Further studies will
be required to differentiate these possibilities.

Although gingipains have been identified as major
virulence factors for P. gingivalis, only a minority of
the strains that mitigated its cytotoxic effects appeared
to affect gingipain activity. It is not unexpected that
different bacterial species may have evolved different/
multiple mechanisms for blocking P. gingivalis-induced
toxicity. Another classic mechanism by which bacteria
may interact with each other is through affecting the
growth of the other organism. This may occur through
competition for nutrients,
through quorum-sensing
mechanisms or production of bacteriostatic or bacterici-
dal agents. We found that among the 19 isolates that
mitigated the cytotoxic effects of P. gingivalis,
four
Actinomyces and two Streptococcus isolates had a direct,
negative effect on growth of P. gingivalis in in vitro
coculture conditions. The inhibitory effect was observed
with live bacteria but not with culture supernatants or
UV-killed cells under the conditions tested.

Possible ways that oral bacteria may affect P. gingivalis
growth include the production of acid or H2O2. Of the
six A. naeslundii and streptococcal strains that inhibited
the growth of P. gingivalis, all were capable of producing
acid. However, there were some acid-producing strains
of bacteria that did not inhibit the growth of P. gingivalis,
suggesting that acid production alone does not regulate
the growth of P. gingivalis. One hypothesis is that there is
production of an enzyme or regulator by the strains that
inhibit P. gingivalis growth that requires a low pH for
activation. Of note, gingipain expression and activity
under anaerobic conditions remains high between pH
6.59.5 with Lysine-gingipain showing a maximum
activity around 7.58.5 but is decreased at lower pHs,
so lower pH may affect virulence even without directly
affecting growth (40).

H2O2 production did not appear to have a clear role in
the growth inhibition of P. gingivalis. Many of the strains
that produced H2O2 did not inhibit P. gingivalis growth
(including the highest producers). Whether H2O2 produc-
tion by these strains may have a role in vivo is unknown.
S. oralis has been previously reported to exert
H2O2-mediated probiotic effects in vivo (41). Interestingly,
we observed that strains that produced H2O2 were more
likely to inhibit the Rgp activity of P. gingivalis in
independent cultures. Addition of H2O2 has been shown
to strongly decrease the Rgp activity of P. gingivalis, while
only moderately affecting its growth in complex culture
medium (42).

The role of

the inhibitory strains of bacteria in
controlling P. gingivalis growth and colonization in the
human mouth is unknown. All of our bacteria were
recovered from patients with some degree of period-
ontitis, and we did not observe a simple correlation
between the number of inhibitory strains recovered and
the severity of periodontitis (data not shown). Interest-
ingly, we did not recover P. gingivalis from any tooth
where an inhibitory strain was also recovered. However,
as our study was not designed to assess the presence and
effects of inhibitory strains on P. gingivalis growth in vivo
and there are numerous alternative explanations for this
finding, the true role of these inhibitory strains on the
presence of P. gingivalis in vivo and on the development of
periodontitis awaits future-controlled trials in healthy
and diseased patients.

Conclusions
This study provides in vitro data on how interactions
between P. gingivalis and other oral bacteria may
influence its pathogenic potential. We have identified a
number of oral bacterial strains that are capable of
reducing the cytotoxic effects of P. gingivalis in vitro
and interfering with its growth and proteolytic acti-
vity through multiple different mechanisms. It is tempting
to speculate that differences in the presence of specific

inhibitory bacteria may help constrain
P. gingivalis and govern the development of periodontitis.
Further work will be necessary to test this and other
hypotheses regarding the role of these inhibitory strains
in health and disease.
