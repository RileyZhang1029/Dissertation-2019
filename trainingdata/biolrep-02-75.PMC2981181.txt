Abstract
Recognition of pancreatic beta cell antigens by autoreactive T lymphocytes plays a central role in the
pathogenesis of insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes. Recent results suggest that non-conventional
antigenic epitope processing and presentation may contribute to triggering and maintaining
autoreactive responses. Moreover, promising results raise hope that autoantigens may become
safe and specific therapeutics for type 1 diabetes in the future.

Introduction and context
Ample evidence documents that both CD4+ helper and
CD8+ killer T lymphocytes are critical in the pathogenesis
of autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) [1]. Although the
initial events triggering autoreactive responses remain
unclear, specific autoantigen presentation by strongly
disease-associated major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class II molecules and, according to recent results,
weakly disease-associated MHC class I molecules is
thought to favor priming and expansion of pathogenic T
cells [2]. Among the steadily expanding list of autoanti-
gens, many are shared between patients and non-obese
diabetic (NOD) mice, the murine model of the disease. In
patients, autoantibodies recognizing four antigens –
insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), insulinoma
antigen-2, and the recently discovered ZnT8 – have strong
disease-predictive value and are measured in clinical
routine diagnostics [3]. Other autoantigens such as islet-
specific glucose-6-phosphate catalytic subunit-related
protein (IGRP) and the very recently identified chromo-
granin A [4] have been studied mainly or exclusively in
mice. The critical issue of whether there is one autoantigen
whose recognition by T cells is an obligatory triggering
event at the onset of the autoimmune response has been
much discussed. In the NOD model, recent evidence

suggests that insulin is one such primary triggering antigen
[5]. Mice tolerized to insulin [6] or mice expressing
exclusively an insulin molecule lacking the immunodo-
minant T-cell epitopes recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells [7] develop neither diabetes nor insulitis, whereas
similar tolerization to other autoantigens has no such
effect [8,9]. It remains unclear whether insulin or any
other antigen plays a similar role in humans.

The pivotal role of T cells in T1D has prompted sustained
and ongoing efforts to identify autoantigenic epitopes,
which can be used to develop T-cell assays potentially
useful for disease prediction or monitoring of immu-
notherapeutic intervention (or both). We [10] and others
[11] have identified a large number of mainly HLA-A2
restricted autoantigenic CD8+ T-cell epitopes. Using these
epitopes, we could develop an enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent spot (ELISpot) T-cell assay that detected
interferon-gamma-secreting T cells in the vast majority
of patients at disease onset, whereas recognition seemed
to vanish during longer-standing disease [12,13]. Recent
studies have identified a number of epitopes derived from
the proinsulin signal peptide, whose level of presentation
may be proportional to the secretory activity of beta cells
[14,15]. However, a recent blinded study evaluating CD4+

T-cell assays found that the sensitivity and specificity of
ELISpot and proliferation assays using purified antigens or
epitopes did not exceed 61% and 69%, respectively, a
performance greatly inferior to autoantibody assays [16].
Moreover, despite much effort spent on T-cell assays,
studies showing that T-cell assays are actually useful for
predicting or monitoring intervention have not been
published as of yet.

Major recent advances
What renders an islet cell protein autoantigenic
and potentially pathogenic?
Among the vast number of proteins expressed by beta cells,
only a few are prominent targets of the cellular auto-
immune response, but the reasons for this selectivity have
remained mysterious. One fairly constant but unexplained
feature of prominent autoantigens is their association
with secretory granules. Recent findings provide intriguing
new leads with respect to this issue. The BDC2.5 CD4+
T-cell clone and T-cell receptor-transgenic mouse line, used
in numerous studies, recognize the most recently described
autoantigen, chromogranin A, another secretory granule
protein [4]. Interestingly, the peptide recognized by these
cells interacts with only the C-terminal half of the I-Ag7
peptide-binding site together with a flanking sequence.
This suggests a non-conventional interaction with the T cell
in a manner reminiscent of immunodominant CD4+ T
cells involved in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis [17].
Non-conventional peptide-MHC class II complexes were
also shown to play an important role in the recognition of
the critical insulin epitope B9-23 by pathogenic T cells.
Mohan and colleagues [18] found that many islet-
infiltrating T cells recognizing this epitope are of ‘type B’;
that
these cells recognize complexes formed by
incubation of antigen-presenting cells with the cognate
peptide but not those formed by incubation with the
source protein insulin, the latter being recognized only
by ‘type A’ T cells. The molecular mechanism for formation
of type B complexes is unclear, but Mohan et al. [18] suggest
that extremely high antigen concentration, a hallmark of
insulin in islets, together with the absence of type B
complexes during thymic selection, plays a crucial role in
the emergence and stimulation of type B insulin-specific T
cells. A specific antigen-processing event could account for
the fact that type B complexes may be produced only in
islets. The notion that a specific potentially novel antigen-
processing pathway may play a role in conferring dominant
autoantigen status to insulin is supported by another study.
Brosi et al. [19] showed that the priming of diabetogenic
insulin-specific CD8+ T cells upon DNA vaccination in
mice that express the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 in
islets depends on translocation of the vaccine-encoded
antigen into the endoplasmic reticulum. Although the

is,

underlying mechanism is entirely unclear, this together
with the other cited studies raises the possibility that
specific antigen-processing and presentation pathways and
events play a role in the autoantigenicity of insulin and
possibly other autoantigens.

Autoantigens as therapeutics
Although immunomodulation through CD3-specific anti-
bodies remains the most successful biological therapeutic
for T1D [20,21], the biological risk necessarily associated
with similar strategies has prompted efforts to develop
therapeutic strategies based on autoantigens, which are
expected to be more specific and safer. In the NOD model,
it is well established that treatment of prediabetic mice
with various autoantigens prevents disease [22]. After a
number of unsuccessful trials using insulin in humans, a
recent study demonstrated for the first time a beneficial
effect of autoantigen administration to patients at disease
onset [23]. Injection of 20 µg of GAD in alum resulted in a
slower decline of glucose-stimulated C-peptide levels in
patients treated no later than 6 months after diagnosis. In
these patients (unlike in anti-CD3-treated patients [21]),
no reduction in insulin needs was observed, but this result
encourages further development of autoantigen-based
approaches in humans.

A promising novel strategy for the reversal of auto-
immunity was very recently described in an elegant study
by Tsai and colleagues [24]. These authors found that
NOD mice harbor antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells
recognizing the highly immunodominant autoantigen
IGRP, which can be expanded by immunization with
nanoparticles coated with specific peptide-MHC com-
plexes. The expanded cells act as suppressors that prevent
disease in young mice and, remarkably, reverse disease in
overtly diabetic mice, a feat previously unmatched for
antigen-based therapies. Nanoparticle stimulation of
relatively minor T-cell populations also induced the
generation of protective suppressor cells, suggesting that
the application of the strategy does not require prior
identification of immunodominant T-cell populations in
every patient treated.

Future directions
As so often is the case, these intriguing studies leave more
questions open than they answer. With respect to the
parameters determining autoantigenicity,
the general
validity of the observed phenomena needs to be studied.
Is partial filling of the MHC class II peptide-binding site a
common feature of autoantigenic CD4+ T-cell epitopes?
Can ‘type B’ T cells with specificity for autoantigens other
than insulin be found? Given that
transferred pre-
processed epitopes are considered highly unstable and

prone to degradation (at least in the context of MHC
class I cross-presentation), how does insulin peptide
B9-23 produced in beta cells ‘survive’ to be presented
by MHC class II molecules of professional antigen-
presenting cells? Why does proinsulin targeting to the
endoplasmic reticulum increase the priming of patho-
genic insulin-specific CD8+ T cells?

With regard to therapeutic approaches, the efficacy must
be ameliorated greatly if true therapeutic benefits are to
be obtained in patients. Combination with low-dose
immunomodulatory treatments and/or earlier treatment
of patients with relatively high C-peptide levels could be
roads to follow. T-cell assays with better performance or
novel T-cell assays likely will be required before clinical
use can be envisaged. Finally, T-cell assays should be
used to monitor patients at T1D risk and/or patients
undergoing immunotherapy to prove the clinical interest
of these assays.
