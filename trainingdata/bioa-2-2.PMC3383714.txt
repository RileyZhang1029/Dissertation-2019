Crosslinking proteins maintain organelle structure and facilitate their function through the crosslinking of cytoskeletal
elements. We recently found an interaction between the giant crosslinking protein dystonin-a2 and the microtubule-
associated protein-1B (MAP1B), occurring in the centrosomal region of the cell.
In addition, we showed that this
interaction is necessary to maintain microtubule acetylation. Loss of dystonin-a2 disrupts MT stability, Golgi organization,
and flux through the secretory pathway. This, coupled to our recent finding that dystonin-a2 is critical in maintaining
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure and function, provides novel
insight into the importance of dystonin in
maintenance of organelle structure and in facilitating intracellular transport. These results highlight the importance of
cytoskeletal dynamics in communicating signals between organelle membranes and the cytoskeleton. Importantly, they
demonstrate how defects in cytoskeletal dynamics can translate into a failure of vesicular trafficking associated with
neurodegenerative disease.

Introduction

Cytoskeletal cross-linker proteins have been the focus of much
attention in disorders of the sensory-motor system. While much
investigation has focused on understanding the role of the giant
cytoskeletal
linker protein dystonin, the daunting size of the
protein coupled to the numerous protein isoforms generated
from the dystonin (Dst) gene have made elucidation of divergent
isoform functions arduous. In the recent article Microtubule
stability, Golgi organization, and transport flux require dystonin-a2/
MAP1B interaction,1 we highlight a novel
the
dystonin-a2 isoform in mediating Golgi organization and flux
through the secretory pathway. We have previously determined
that the dystonin-a2 isoform is anchored at the nuclear envelope,
and is involved in organization of membranous structures of the
ER.2-5 We have now performed expression profiling of pre-
phenotype stage dystonin null dorsal root ganglia and isoform-
specific loss of function analysis to evaluate the role of dystonin in
flux through the secretory pathway. We find defects in antero-
grade transport and secretion coincident with ultrastructural
dilation of the Golgi complex and loss of MT acetylation resulting

plex. Maintenance of MT acetylation status through chemical
inhibition of deacetylation or MAP1B overexpression, maintains
Golgi

Figure 1. Transport flux in dtTg4 sensory neurons is impeded. (A) Flux through the secretory pathway was assessed in primary sensory neurons. Secreted
gaussia luciferase (GLuc) was delivered to WT and dtTg4 sensory neurons, and its secretion was monitored by measuring luciferase activity in the medium

sensory neurons, (anova post hoc Tukey, *p , 0.05, n = 3). (B) Defective trafficking of VSVGts0–45 (VSVG) from the ER to the Golgi was observed in dtTg4

cause of sensory-motor pathologies. We find dystonin-a2 critical
to maintenance of transport flux by maintaining the structural
organization of both the ER and Golgi.1,2 We further find this
effect to be conserved across multiple dystonia musculorum (dt)
mutant alleles.

dt is an inherited homozygous recessive sensory neuropathy,
which results in a severe form of ataxia in mice. Mutations in the
Dst gene underlie the dt disorder. There exist several dt alleles,
including those induced through spontaneous mutations (e.g.,
dt27J) or through transgene insertion (e.g., dtTg4).8 As both dtTg4
and dt27J alleles are allelic and do not complement, the nature of
their mutations impacts the expression of dystonin isoforms
differently.8,9 The dtTg4 mutation prevents the expression of two
dystonin isoforms, dystonin-a1 and -a2; while the dt27J mutation
disrupts the expression of all three dystonin isoforms, dystonin-a1,
-a2 and -a3.8,9

We report here, consistent with our findings in dt27J spontane-
ous mutant mice, that a second dt allele, the transgenic dtTg4
mouse, displays similar deficits in secretion and Golgi organiza-
tion (Fig. 1). A failure in transport flux results from defective
ER-Golgi transport emanating from aberrant organization of the
endomembrane system. Dystonin-a2 is a giant cytoskeletal linker
protein flanked by an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a
C-terminal microtubule binding domain. The transmembrane
domain of dystonin-a2 positions the protein in the perinuclear
membranes of the ER, Golgi and NE. The microtubule bind-
ing domain of dystonin anchors these membranes to the micro-
tubular cytoskeleton. This maintains the organization of the
Golgi around the microtubule organizing complex (MTOC) and
centrosome (Fig. 2). Ultrastructural and macrostructural evaluation

of the Golgi revealed both the dispersal of Golgi ribbons in
addition to the dilation of Golgi vesicles in the absence of
dystonin-a2. We also observed ultrastructural defects in the ER
of dt27J sensory neurons,2 which preceded phenotype onset. We
believe these structural abnormalities arise through impaired
cytoskeletal dynamics. Support
from
previous
studies wherein ectopic expression of dystonin-a2
localizes with both ER and Golgi protein markers, and re-
organizes the ER via cytoskeletal filaments.3 At the NE, the
dystonin-a2 isoform associates with the NE protein nesprin 3a.
However, ultrastructural analysis of the NE has not revealed
any gross changes in NE structure (data not shown). As such,
the cellular role of dystonin-a2 at the NE does not appear to
involve structural maintenance. Rather, dystonin-a2 recruits
various cytoskeletal elements to the NE.4,5 Perturbation of this
connection between the NE and cytoskeleton may underlie
the eccentric nuclei observed in dystonin deficient
sensory
neurons10,11 and may yet prove to be essential to intracellular
communication via the endomembrane system. We propose a
novel function for dystonin-a2 in the regulation of ER-Golgi
transport though binding and sequestration, or in some instances
activation, of multiple proteins required for normal transport
flux. We find dystonin-a2 to functionally interact with multiple
proteins critical to ER-Golgi transport.12 Through interaction
with MAP1B (centrosome), clathrin (Golgi), nesprin 3a (NE),
neurobeachin (lysosomes) and CLIP-170 (polymerizing micro-
tubules),12 or direct anchoring of membranes via the N-terminal
transmembrane domain, dystonin modulates activity of proteins
critical to proper vesicular transport between every organelle of
the endomembrane system. The full extent of

Dystonin-a2: A transducer of second messenger signaling?
Our analyses of dystonin-a2 focused on the neuronal cell soma,
where we find dystonin-a2 critically associates with the ER,
Golgi and NE. Within the soma, rough ER sheets and cis-
Golgi elements are most prominent, and are involved in protein
synthesis,
trafficking, quality control, and post-translational
modification.13,14 Through modulation of organelle structure,
we find dystonin-a2 to be critically linked to second messenger
signal transduction. Ultrastructural aberrations in ER morphology
following dystonin loss were evaluated for their impact on ER
function. We found that primary sensory neurons derived from
dt27J mice show perturbations in both Ca2+ homeostasis (i.e.,
defective efflux of Ca2+ from the ER) and protein quality-control
(i.e., activation of the unfolded protein response).2 While this
study provided important insight into the cellular functions of
dystonin-a2, it suggests dystonin-a2 may act as a link between
endomembrane system function and apoptosis. Maintenance of
transport flux between the ER and Golgi is critical to neuronal
function. As transport defects are associated with numerous

neurodegenerative diseases,
these processes must be tightly
regulated and mechanisms must exist to translate defects in
orthograde transport into apoptotic messages. Maintenance of
ER Ca2+ homeostasis may represent one avenue through which
these signals are transduced.

however, whether aberrant ER morphology is causal of Ca2+
dyshomeostasis or whether dystonin-a2 interacts with other ER-
proteins capable of regulating calcium mobilization.

Conclusion

Dystonin proteins have been implicated in a variety of cellular
processes,
including processing of proteins through secretory
pathways, transport of organelles along neuronal processes, and
maintaining cytoskeletal integrity. Their broad involvement in
cellular mechanisms can be explained by the importance of cyto-
skeletal dynamics and the role these proteins have in commun-
icating signals between membranes and the cytoskeleton. While
the role we highlight herein for dystonin-a2 in ER-Golgi trans-
port is novel,
it is also intuitive given the integral role the
cytoskeleton plays in maintaining the structure and function of
membrane organelles. Dystonin-a2 is primarily expressed in

of our work has focused on the role of dystonin isoforms in
post-mitotic neurons. The diverse expression of dystonin iso-
forms in dividing cells of the skeletal muscle and epithelial cell
lineages prompts intriguing questions on the role of dystonin
in endomembrane organelles at multiple stages of the cell cycle.
It would be interesting to assess the impact loss of dystonin has
on the integrity of organelles (i.e., ER, Golgi and NE) in divid-
ing cells. Understanding the common functions of dystonin
proteins in multiple cell systems will provide critical insight into
the role of ER/Golgi/NE cytoskeletal interactions in maintaining
cell integrity.
