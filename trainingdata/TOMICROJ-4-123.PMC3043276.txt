Abstract:  Taxonomy  and  identification  of  fastidious  Gram  negatives  are  evolving  and  challenging.  We  compared  
identifications achieved with the Vitek 2 Neisseria-Haemophilus (NH) card and partial 16S rRNA gene sequence (526 bp 
stretch)  analysis  with  identifications  obtained  with  extensive  phenotypic  characterization  using  100  fastidious  Gram  
negative bacteria. Seventy-five  strains represented 21 of the 26 taxa included in the Vitek 2 NH database and 25 strains 
represented related species not included in the database. Of the 100 strains, 31 were the type strains of the species. Vitek 2 
NH identification results: 48 of 75 database strains were correctly  identified, 11 strains gave  `low discrimination´, seven 
strains  were  unidentified,  and  nine  strains  were  misidentified.  Identification  of  25  non-database  strains  resulted  in  14 
strains  incorrectly  identified  as  belonging  to  species  in  the  database.  Partial  16S  rRNA  gene  sequence  analysis  results:  
For 76 strains phenotypic and sequencing identifications were identical, for 23 strains the sequencing identifications were 
either  probable  or  possible,  and  for  one  strain  only  the  genus  was  confirmed.  Thus,  the  Vitek  2  NH  system  identifies  
most  of  the  commonly  occurring  species  included  in  the  database.  Some  strains  of  rarely  occurring  species  and  strains  
of  non-database  species  closely  related  to  database  species  cause  problems.  Partial  16S  rRNA  gene  sequence  analysis  
performs well, but does not always suffice, additional phenotypical characterization being useful for final identification.

INTRODUCTION 

Fastidious Gram-negative bacteria  comprise a number of 
 
different genera and species that may cause serious systemic 
infections. Their fastidious nature often  makes identification 
a challenge in the routine microbiology laboratory, and their 
ability to cause invasive disease  makes correct identification 
important.  Their  ability  to  cause  endocarditis  (HACEK 
group  of  bacteria:  Haemophilus  spp.,  Aggregatibacter  spp, 
Cardiobacterium species, Eikenella  corrodens, and  Kingella 
kingae),  animal-bite  infections  (e.g.  Capnocytophaga  spp., 
Neisseria  weaveri,  and  Pasteurella  spp.)  and  their  role  in 
abscess formation (E.  corrodens, Aggregatibacter actinomy-
cetemcomitans) 
importance  [1].  Other  
diagnostic  challenges  are  that  their  taxonomy,  including  
nomenclature  [e.g.  2,  3],  as  well  as  the  recognition  of  their 
etiologic possibilities, are continuously evolving; an example 
of  the  latter  is  the  possibility  of  infective  endocarditis  when 
Neisseria elongata is isolated from blood cultures.

their 

  Conventional  identification  of  fastidious  Gram-negative 
bacteria is  at times cumbersome, often requiring special me-
dia and phenotypic tests, plus specialist knowledge. As far as 
we  know,  there  are  only  two  fully  automated  identification 
systems for identification of fastidious Gram negative bacte-
ria  on  the  market,  Vitek  2  Neisseria-Haemophilus  (NH)

(bioMérieux,  Marcy  L’Etoile,  France)  and  Phoenix  (Becton 
Dickinson,  Cockneyville,  MD,  USA).  BioMérieux  has  de-
veloped  a  card  for  the  identification  of  26  taxa  of  fastidious 
Gram-negatives,  including  Neisseria,  Haemophilus,  and  the 
HACEK  bacteria,  for  use  in  the  Vitek  2  system.  The  card 
consists  of  30  biochemical  tests  that  are  monitored  up  to  8 
hours. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of 
the  Vitek  2  system  in  a  clinical  microbiology  laboratory  by 
comparing it with identification by conventional methods. In 
addition,  it  was  attempted  to  assess  the  value  of  partial  16S 
rRNA gene sequence analysis (526 bp stretch) for identifica-
tion within this group of bacteria.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Bacterial Strains 

  The  100  bacterial  strains  examined  in  this  study  are 
shown  in  Tables  1a,  1b,  and  2.  They  comprise  clinical 
strains received for species identification or for research and 
monitoring  purposes  at  the  reference  laboratories  at  Statens 
Serum Institut (SSI), supplemented with strains from various 
culture  collections.  The  latter  included  31  type  strains,  of 
which one is the type strain of Haemophilus paraphrophilus, 
now  part  of  the  new  species  Aggregatibacter  aphrophilus 
[2],  and  another  the  type  strain  of  Haemophilus  pittmaniae,  
a  new  species  comprising  some  haemolytic  strains  of  
Haemophilus [4]. The strains comprised two groups: a group 
of  75  strains  representing  20  of  the  26  taxa  included  in  
the  Vitek  2  database  (the  three  Campylobacter  taxa  plus

had  been  stored  as  either  lyophilized  or  at  -  70oC  until  
the  present  study.  All  strains  were  sent  from  SSI  under  
code  numbers  to  the  Clinical  Microbiology  Department  at 
Hillerød,  so  that  the  investigators  were  blinded  with  respect 
to species identification.  

  The  new  validly  published  genus  name  Aggregatibacter 
[2]  was  used  in  the  present  study  for  the  following  species 
given as such in the Vitek database: Haemophilus actinomy-
cetemcomitans,  Haemophilus  aphrophilus  /  paraphrophilus 
and Haemophilus segnis. 

Identification of Strains 

  Conventional  phenotypic  identification  comprised  ex-
tensive characterization by the various reference laboratories 
at SSI according to conventional biochemical methods [1, 5, 6]. 
The  final  identification  reached  was  considered  to  be  the 
‘gold standard’ with which identifications obtained by partial 
16S  rRNA  gene  sequence  analysis  and  the  Vitek  2  NH  
system were compared. 

  Partial  16S  rRNA  gene  sequence  analysis  followed  by 
blast examination was performed [7] using two amplification 
primers, BSF 8 and BSF 534, producing a 526 base pair (bp) 
fragment;  these  fragments  were  sequenced  both  ways.  The 
edited  sequences  were  compared  to  deposited  sequences  in 
the  NCBI  “bacteria”  database  (BLAST  examination)  and 
evaluated for  the best  and second best taxon matches taking

between the query and the subject sequence in the database), 
Maxscore  bit  (indication  of  alignment  concordance)  and  E-
values  (indication  of  statistical  significance  of  a  given

by  partial  16S  rRNA  gene  sequencing/BLAST  examination: 
1) ‘confirmed’ (best species match was identical  to  the gold 
standard  phenotypic  identification  with  a  distance  in  Max-
score  bits  to  next  best  taxon  match  of  >  15),  2)  ‘probable’ 
(best species match was identical to the gold standard identi-
fication,  but  with  a  Maxscore  bit  difference  to  next  best 
taxon  match  of  <  15),  3)  ‘possible’  (best  species  match  was 
not identical to  the gold standard identification, but the gold 
standard  identification  was  among  closely  related  taxons, 
which  means  a  <  15  Maxscore  bit  difference  to  the  best 
taxon  match)  or  4)  ‘misidentified’  (if  the  conventional  
phenoptypis  species  identification  was  not  listed  among  the 
closely related species/taxons).

some of the supplementary tests were unavailable to us; and 
ii) results of these tests would tend to confuse identifications 
further since 25 % of the  tested strains were not included  in 
the Vitek 2 NH database.  

 
Interpretation  was  done  on  the  basis  of  results  provided 
from  the  software  (EX:  excellent,  VG:  Very  Good,  GI: 
Good,  AC:  Acceptable,  LD:  Low  Discrimination  (between 
2-3  identification  choices),  INC:  Inconclusive  (>  3  identifi-
cation choices), and UNI: Unidentified (atypical biopattern)).

RESULTS 

Partial  16S  rRNA  Gene  Sequence  Analysis  Identifica-
tions 

  The  identifications  achieved  by  partial  16S  rRNA  gene 
sequence analysis of the 100 strains are shown in Tables 1a, 
1b,  and  2.  Phenotypic  and  sequence  analysis  identifications 
to the species level were  identical for 76 strains, resulting in 
‘species  confirmed’. For 23 strains sequence analysis  identi-
fications  resulted  in  either  ‘species  probable’(n=16)  or  ‘spe-
cies  possible’  (n=7):  2  of  3  A.  hominis  strains,  2  of  6  C. 
canimorsus  strains,  1  of  2 K.  denitrificans  strains,  1  of  2 N. 
lactamica  strains,  1  of  2  N  sicca  strains  and  2  of  3  N.  ani-
maloris strains; and all included strains of the following spe-
cies:  Actinobacillus  ureae  (2),  C.  ochracea  (1),  H.  para-
haemolyticus  (2)  and  H.  pittmanniae  (1),  N.  cinerea  (3),  N. 
flavescens (1), N. mucosa (2) and N. polysaccharea (1). Only 
for  the  Neisseria  pharyngis  strain  was  the  result  of  16S 
rRNA  gene  sequence  analysis  in  conflict  with  the  conven-
tional  phenotypic  identification,  where  the  “gold  standard” 
species  was  not  among  the  listed  taxon  matches.  Of  the  24 
strains  where  phenotypic  and  sequence  analysis  identifica-
tions were not identical, 12 were type strains.  

  Where  several  strains  of  the  same  species  were  exam-
ined,  score  bit  differences  among  the  different  strains  were 
about  the  same  size  for  most  of  the  species.  However,  for 
two  of  the  six  C.  canimorsus  strains  (CCUG  19190  and 
CCUG 19141) the differences between first and second best 
taxon  match  were  very  small  (0  and  3  respectively),  while 
they were between 54 and 168 for the remaining four strains. 
The  same  applied  to  the  two  K.  denitrificans  strains  (0  and 
116). Remarkable variations in score bit differences between 
strains  belonging  to  the  same  species  were  seen  for  all  the 
strains  of  A.  segnis,  C.  hominis,  H.  parainfluenzae  and  K. 
kingae.  Of  the  24  strains  where  the  result  was  not  ‘species 
confirmed’  by  sequencing,  13  were  Vitek  database  strains. 
Of these, seven were  correctly identified by  the Vitek 2 NH 
card. 

Vitek Identifications of Vitek 2 NH Database Strains 

  Vitek  2  NH  results  for  the  75  examined  strains  included 
in  the  Vitek  2  NH  database  are  shown  in  Table  1a  and  1b. 
Epithets of ‘acceptable’ or better were obtained for 57 (76%) 
of  the  strains.  Of  these,  48  (64%)  were  correctly  identified, 
while 9 (12%) were misidentified. The risk of misidentifica-
tion  seems  to  be  related  to  the  epithets,  as  4  of  the  45  with 
‘excellent’  identification, 0 of 2 with ‘very good’ identifica-
tion,  2  of  4  with  ‘good’  identification  and  3  of  6  with  ‘ac-
ceptable’  identification  were  misidentified  (Table  3).  The 
nine  misidentified  strains  comprised  three  of  nine  Capnocy-
tophaga  strains  identified  as  Neisseria  elongata,  three 
proline-arylamidase  (proA)  negative  Neisseria  gonorrhoeae 
identified as Moraxella catarrhalis, one each of Haemophilus 
haemolyticus  (type  strain)  and  H.  parahaemolyticus,  both 
identified  as Haemophilus  parainfluenzae,  and  one A.  ureae 
identified as H. influenzae. 

 
In  11  (15%)  instances  where  ‘low  discrimination’  be-
tween  2  or  3  species  was  obtained,  the  correct  species  was 
included among the suggested species for 9 strains (Table 3). 
For the 4 ‘low discrimination’ Neisseria spp., 3 were  identi-
fied  correctly  to  the  genus  level  (Table 3).  If  one  disregards 

Sönksen et al. 

the recent taxonomic changes within the genus Haemophilus 
(Materials  and  Methods), 4 of 4 ‘low discrimination’ strains 
of former and present Haemophilus spp. were identified cor-
rectly to the genus level (Table 3).  

  There were no strains where an ‘inconclusive’ result was 
obtained. Seven strains (9%) were unidentified: four of nine 
strains of Capnocytophaga spp., including the type strains of 
C. gingivalis and  C. sputigena;  two of three Kingella kingae 
strains,  including  the  type  strain;  and  the  type  strain  of  A. 
segnis. 

Vitek Identification of Non-Vitek 2 NH Database Strains 

  Table  2  shows  results  for  the  25  examined  strains  not 
included  in  the  Vitek  2  NH  database.  Of  these,  14  (56%) 
were  identified  with  epithets  of  ‘excellent’  (7),  ‘good’  (4), 
and ‘acceptable’ (3). All of these were by definition misiden-
tified. Four strains were unidentified, which in this context is 
the correct result; and ‘Low discrimination’ was obtained for 
seven strains (Table 3). 

DISCUSSION 

  Analysis (and comparison) of 16S rRNA gene sequences 
has revolutionized bacterial taxonomy and identification [9]. 
For  strains  difficult  to  identify  by  conventional  phenotypic 
identification  16S  rRNA  gene  sequencing  is  especially  in 
focus [8]. Among the 100 strains studied, only a N. pharyngis 
strain  obtained  sequencing  analysis  results 
in  conflict  
with the conventional phenotypic identification, as the “gold  
standard”  species  was  not  among  the  listed  possible  taxon 
matches. Importantly, the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis 
results  obtained  did  not  result  in  misidentifications,  but  for 
24  strains  the  need  for  further  characterization  was  evident. 
This  could  consist  of  sequencing  of  longer  bp  stretches  of  
the  16S  rRNA  gene,  sequencing  of  other  genes,  or  more  
extensive phenotypic characterization.  

  The obtained results thus illustrate both the strengths and 
weaknesses of  the use of 16S rRNA gene  sequence analysis 
for  identification.  There  are,  as  yet,  no  generally  accepted 
guidelines  for  correct  genus  and  species  identification,  as  
it  has  not  been  possible  to  reach  a  consensus  on  threshold 
values like there is for DNA–DNA hybridization (Petti, 2007 
[9],  Stackebrandt  &  Goebel,  1994  [10],  Janda  &  Abbott, 
2007  [11]).  In  addition,  different  studies  have  identified 
groups  of  bacteria  for  which  16S  rRNA  gene  sequences  are 
less  discriminative,  as  seen  in  this  study  for  the  23  strains 
resulting in either species probable or possible.  

 
Sequence  divergence  may  vary  considerably  within  gen-
era  and  must  ideally  be  assessed  for  each  genus.  We  have 
attempted to elucidate the 16S rRNA gene sequence identifi-
cation process by using standardized quantitative  criteria for 
all  the  studied  taxa  (see  Materials  and  Methods)  and  report-
ing the data in Tables 1 and 2 together with the species of the 
best  and  next  best  taxon  match.  This  in  order  to  document 
the 16S rRNA gene sequence identification process. 

  Great  variation  in  score  bit  differences  was  seen  within 
strains of A. segnis, C. canimorsus, C. hominis, H. parainflu-
enzae,  K.  denitrificans,  and  K.  kingae.  This  might  be  an  ex-
pression  of  great  variation  within  the  individual  species,  it 
may illustrate that  taxonomic subgroups exist, or it could be 
caused  by  deposition  of  unvalidated  sequences.  Whether

sequencing  the  whole  16S  rRNA  gene  would  have  resulted 
in  a  confirmed  species  designation  for  the  23  probable  and 
possible  strains  is  not  known.  Of  these  23  strains,  12  were 
type  strains,  six  were  culture  collection  strains  and  the  re-
maining five were from well known reference laboratories.  

 
Identification  with  the  Vitek  2  NH  card  is,  as  with  the 
whole Vitek 2 system,  easy to handle.  Correct identification 
(including Capnocytophaga to the genus level) was achieved 
for 48 of 75 (64%) strains in the Vitek 2 NH database, while 
9  (12%)  were  misidentified.  Identification  problems,  i.e.  
low  discrimination  and  non-  or  misidentification  of  strains, 
were  mainly  connected  with  the  Capnocytophaga  spp., 
proA-negative N. gonnorhoeae, the haemolytic Haemophilus 
spp.,  the  Kingella  spp.  and  A.  segnis.  There  were  four  mis-
identified strains with the epithet ‘excellent’, three gonococci 
and one A. ureae, which means that this epithet is not a guar-
antee of correct identification. It must, however, be borne in 
mind that the three misidentified gonococci were proA nega-
tive,  a  clone  with  this  characteristic  appearing  most  com-
monly in Scandinavia.  

  Our finding of 64% of correctly identified strains appears 
to be at variance with the findings of Valenza et al. [12], who 
found that 91% of their 188 strains were  correctly  identified 
without  supplementary  tests.  This  difference  is  most  readily 
explained  by  differences  in  the  qualitative  and  quantitative 
composition  of  the  examined  strains  in  the  two  studies. Va-
lenza et al. examined no strains of proA-negative N. gonnor-
hoeae, H. haemolyticus, H. parahaemolyticus, A. ureae or A. 
segnis; and only one strain each of Capnocytophaga spp. and 
Kingella  spp.  This  is  in  contrast  to  our  nine  strains  of  Cap-
nocytophaga spp. and five strains of Kingella spp. However, 
these taxa represent some of the most difficult with regard to 
conventional  identification,  making  it  extra  desirable  that 
automatic  identification  results  in  reliable  identifications. 
Disregarding  these  problematic  strains,  results  of  the  two 
studies are similar. With regard to the 49 remaining strains in 
the  present  study  we  found  no  un-  or  misidentified  strains 
compared  to  five  unidentified  and  one  misidentified  strains 
among  the  126  remaining  strains  in  the  study  of  Valenza  
et al.  

  Our results also appear to disagree with the recently pub-
lished  multicenter  study  by  Rennie  et  al.  [13],  where  371 
clinical  strains  were  tested.  They  found  97%  overall  correct 
identification,  including  among  the  correctly  identified 
strains 10% with low discrimination where the correct identi-
fication  was  among  the  suggested  choices.  Again,  the  vari-
ance is probably explained by the different quantitative com-
position  of  the  strains  examined  in  the  two  studies.  Of  the 
strains  examined  in  the  study  of  Rennie  et  al.,  35%  were 
‘easy-to-identify’  H.  influenzae  and  H.  parainfluenzae,  in 
contrast to only 6% in the present study. Also, their study did 
not comprise proA-negative N. gonorrhoeae. The conclusion 
drawn  from  the  three  studies  is  thus  that  the  Vitek  2  system 
correctly  identifies  almost  all  strains  of  H.  influenzae,  H. 
parainfluenzae,  C.  hominis,  E.  corrodens,  N.  meningitidis 
and  the  four  apathogenic  Neisseria  species  included  in  the 
database.  

  As  done  previously  by  others  [14,  15],  we  did  not  limit 
our  study  to  strains  included  in  the  Vitek  2  database.  This 
was  done  in  order  to  evaluate  the  ability  of  the  Vitek  2  NH 

Sönksen et al. 

card in a setting most closely  emulating  the diagnostic chal-
lenges  in  clinical  microbiology  laboratories.  As  seen  under 
Results,  56%  of  these  strains  were  erroneously  ‘correctly 
identified’ with epithets of acceptable or better, half of them 
‘excellent’. Only four strains were correctly found to be uni-
dentified and seven showed ‘low discrimination’. This is not 
satisfactory.  

 
In  conclusion,  the  Vitek  2  NH  card  was  found  to  be  an 
easily  used  tool  in  the  laboratory,  being  able  to  identify  the 
most  commonly  occurring  species  in  the  database  correctly. 
The  system  would  benefit  from  including  tests  in  the  card 
that ensures that apparent “correct identifications” of bacteria 
not  in  the  database  kept  at  a  minimum.  And  conversely,  in-
cluding  tests  that  enable  difficult  bacteria  such  as  Capnocy-
tophaga and Kingella to be identified correctly.
