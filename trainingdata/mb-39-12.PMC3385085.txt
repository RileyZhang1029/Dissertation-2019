Cellular  damage  caused  by  reactive  oxygen  species  has  been  implicated  in  several  diseases,  thus  establishing  a  significant
role  for  antioxidants  in  maintaining  human  health.  Acetone,  methanol,  and  hot  water  extracts  of  Pleurotus  citrinopileatus
were  evaluated  for  their  antioxidant  activities  against  β-carotene-linoleic  acid  and  1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl  (DPPH)  rad-
icals,  reducing  power,  ferrous  ion-chelating  abilities,  and  xanthine  oxidase  inhibitory  activities.  In  addition,  the  tyrosinase
inhibitory  effects  and  phenolic  compound  contents  of  the  extracts  were  also  analyzed.  Methanol  and  acetone  extracts  of  P.
citrinopileatus  showed  stronger  inhibition  of  β-carotene-linoleic  acid  compared  to  the  hot  water  extract.  Methanol  extract  (8
mg/mL)  showed  a  significantly  high  reducing  power  of  2.92  compared  to  the  other  extracts.  The  hot  water  extract  was  more
effective  than  the  acetone  and  methanole  extracts  for  scavenging  DPPH  radicals.  The  strongest  chelating  effect  (92.72%)  was
obtained  with  1.0 mg/mL  of  acetone  extract.  High  performance  liquid  chromatography  analysis  detected  eight  phenolic  com-
pounds,  including  gallic  acid,  protocatechuic  acid,  chlorogenic  acid,  ferulic  acid,  naringenin,  hesperetin,  formononetin,  and
biochanin-A,  in  an  acetonitrile  and  hydrochloric  acid  (5 : 1)  solvent  extract.  Xanthine  oxidase  and  tyrosinase  inhibitory  activ-
ities  of  the  acetone,  methanol,  and  hot  water  extracts  increased  with  increasing  concentration.  This  study  suggests  that  fruit-
ing  bodies  of  P.  citrinopileatus  can  potentially  be  used  as  a  readily  accessible  source  of  natural  antioxidants.

Pleurotus  citrinopileatus,  which  belongs  to  the  family  pleu-
rotaceae and order agaricales, is a popular edible mushroom
in China and Japan due to its bright color, unique flavor, and
texture  [1].  Recently,  this  mushroom  was  successfully  culti-
vated  and  made  commercially  available  in  Korea.  This
mushroom  grows  on  fallen  trees  and  stumps  of  broad-leaf
trees  and  is  commercially  cultivated  on  sawdust,  rice  straw,
sugarcane bagasse, cotton seed, and peanut hulls [2].

Medicinally-edible  mushrooms  are  an  important  source
of  natural  antioxidants  [3].  Natural  antioxidants  increase
the antioxidative capacity of plasma and reduce the risk of
certain  diseases  such  as  cancer,  heart  diseases,  and  stroke
[4].  Secondary  metabolites  such  as  phenolics  and  flavonoids
from  mushrooms  have  been  reported  to  be  potent  free
radical  scavengers  [5].  The  catalysis  of  xanthine  by  the
enzyme  xanthine  oxidase  (XO)  can  lead  to  the  accumula-
tion  of  uric  acid  and  ultimately  cause  gout.  Allopurinol,  a
XO  inhibitor  prescribed  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  gout,
acts  as  a  substrate  for  the  competitive  inhibitor  of  the
enzyme [6]. A potential source of such compounds can be
obtained  from  edible  mushrooms.  Flavonoids  and  polyphe-

nolic  crude  extracts  of  mushrooms  have  been  reported  to
possess XO inhibitory activity [7].

Tyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme widely distrib-
uted  in  mushrooms,  plants,  and  animals  and  is  responsible
for  melanization.  The  formation  of  melanin  in  the  human
body can be influenced or reduced by several mechanisms,
including  anti-oxidation,  direct  tyrosinase  inhibition,  and
hormonal activities, etc. [8]. Tyrosinase inhibitors are used
frequently  in  cosmetics  and  depigmenting  agents  for  the
hyperpigmentation [9]. Therefore, a concerted effort has been
made  to  search  for  naturally  occurring  tyrosinase  inhibi-
tors  in  P.  citrinopileatus.  Although  the  nutritional  value
and taste components of P. citrinopileatus have been thor-
oughly studied, little information is available on its antiox-
idant  and  antityrosinase  properties.  Therefore,  the  aim  of
the  present  study  was  to  investigate  the  antioxidant  and
antityrosinase  activities  of  the  acetone,  methanol,  and  hot
water extracts of P. citrinopileatus fruiting bodies.

Aldrich  (St.  Louis,  MO,  USA).  All  chemicals  and  sol-
vents  were  used  as  high-performance  liquid  chromatogra-
phy (HPLC) or analytical grade.

Mushroom  and  extraction. Fresh,  mature  fruiting  bodies
of  P.  citrinopileatus  were  obtained  from  Mushroom  Divi-
sion,  National  Institute  of  Horticultural  and  Herbal  Sci-
ence,  Rural  Development  Administration,  Suwon,  Korea.
A  pure  culture  was  deposited  in  Culture  Collection  DNA
Bank  of  Mushroom  (CCDBM),  Division  of  Life  Sciences,
University  of  Incheon,  Korea  with  the  acquired  accession
No.  IUM-3969.  Fruiting  bodies  were  dried  with  hot  air  at
40oC  for  48 hr  and  finely  pulverized.  Five  grams  of  pow-
dered  samples  were  extracted  with  100 mL  of  60%  ace-
tone and 80%  methanol  with  stirring  at 150 rpm  for  24 hr
at  25oC  to  obtain  the  acetone  and  methanol  extracts,
respectively.  The  mixture  was  then  filtered  through  two
layers  of  Whatman  No.  1  filter  paper  (Whatman,  Maid-
stone,  UK).  Following  this,  the  same  quantity  of  sample
was  boiled  at  100oC  for  3 hr  with  100 mL  of  deionized
distilled  water  to  obtain  the  hot  water  extract.  The  mix-
ture  was  cooled  to  room  temperature  and  filtered  through
Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The residues were then extracted
with  two  additional  100 mL  aliquots  of  acetone,  metha-
nol,  and  deionized  water,  as  described  above.  Then,  the
combined  extracts  were  evaporated  using  a  rotary  evapo-
rator  (Eyela,  Saitama,  Japan)  at  40oC,  after  which  the
remaining  solvent  was  removed  with  a  freeze-drier  (Opti-
zen,  Daejeon,  Korea).  The  yields  of  the  acetone,  metha-
nol,  and  hot  water  extracts  of  P.  citrinopileatus  were
24.42, 23.81, and 19.58% (w/w), respectively.

Antioxidant  activity  by  β-carotene-linoleic  acid. Anti-
oxidant  activity  was  determined  by  measuring  the  inhibi-
tion  of  volatile  organic  compounds  and  conjugated  diene
hydroperoxides  arising  from  linoleic  acid  oxidation  [10].
A  stock  β-carotene-linoleic  acid  mixture  was  prepared  as
follows:  0.5 mg  of  β-carotene  was  dissolved  in  1 mL  of
chloroform,  after  which  25 µL  of  linoleic  acid  and
200 mg  Tween  40  were  added.  The  chloroform  was
removed  completely  using  a  vacuum  evaporator.  Then,
100 mL of oxygenated distilled water was added with vig-
orous  shaking,  and  2.5 mL  of  this  reaction  mixture  was
dispensed  into  test  tubes.  Following  this,  0.5 mL  each  of
various  concentrations  (0.5~20.0 mg/mL)  of  the  extracts
in  methanol  was  added,  and  the  reaction  mixture  was
incubated for up to 2 hr at 50oC. The same procedure was

repeated  with  the  positive  controls  BHT  and  TOC  and  a
blank.  After  incubation,  the  absorbance  levels  of  the  mix-
tures  were  measured  at  490 nm  using  a  spectrophotome-
ter  (Optizen  POP;  Mecasys  Co.  Ltd.,  Daejeon,  Korea).
Absorbance  was  measured  until  the  β-carotene  color  dis-
appeared.  The  β-carotene  bleaching  rate  (R)  was  calcu-
lated according to Eq. (1).

R = ln (a/b)/t

(1)

where  ln = natural  log,  a = absorbance  at  time  t  (0),  and
b = absorbance  at  time  t  (120 min).  The  antioxidant  activ-
ity  (AA)  was  calculated  as  the  percent  inhibition  relative
to the control using Eq. (2).

AA = [(Rcontrol

− Rsample)/Rcontrol] × 100

(2)

AAs  of  the  extracts  were  compared  to  those  of  BHT  and
TOC  at  0.5 mg/mL  and  a  blank  consisting  of  0.5 mL  of
methanol.

Reducing  power. Reducing  power  was  determined  ac-
cording  to  the  method  of  Gülçin  et  al.  [11].  Each  extract
(1~8 mg/mL) in methanol (2.5 mL) was mixed with 2.5 mL
of 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL
of  1%  potassium  ferricynide,  followed  by  incubation  at
50oC  for  20 min.  Then,  2.5 mL  of  10%  trichloroacetic  acid
was  added,  and  the  mixture  was  centrifuged  at  200 ×g
(6K  15;  Sigma,  Mannchein,  Germany)  for  10 min.  The
upper  layer  (2.5 mL)  was  mixed  with  2.5 mL  of  deion-
ized water and 0.5 mL of 0.1% ferric chloride. Finally, the
absorbance  was  measured  at  700 nm  against  a  blank.  BHT
and TOC were used as positive controls.

Scavenging of DPPH radical. The hydrogen atom con-
tent or electron donation ability of the corresponding extracts
as well as some pure compounds were measured based on
bleaching  of  the  purple-colored  DPPH  methanol  solution
[12].  Four  mL  each  of  various  concentrations  (0.125~
2.0 mg/mL)  of  the  extracts  in  methanol  was  added  to
1 mL of DPPH radical solution in methanol (final concen-
tration  of  DPPH  was  0.2 mM).  The  mixture  was  shaken
vigorously  and  allowed  to  stand  for  30 min,  after  which
the  absorbance  of  the  resulting  solution  was  measured  at
517 nm  using  a  spectrophotometer.  Inhibition  of  DPPH
free radical as a percent (I%) was calculated as:

I% = [(Acontrol

− Asample)/Acontrol] × 100

where  Acontrol  is  the  absorbance  of  the  control  reaction
(containing  all  reagents  except  the  test  compound)  and
Asample is the absorbance of the test compound. BHT, TOC,
and L-ascorbic acid were used as positive controls.

Chelation  of  ferrous  ions. Chelating  activity  was  deter-
mined according to the method of Dinis et al. [13]. Briefly,
2 mL each of various concentrations (0.063~1.0 mg/mL) of

14

Alam  et  al.

the extracts in methanol was added to a solution of 2 mM
FeCl2 (0.05 mL). The reaction was initiated by adding 5 mM
ferrozine  (0.2 mL).  The  total  volume  was  adjusted  to  5 mL
with  methanol,  after  which  the  mixture  was  shaken  vigor-
ously and left at room temperature for 10 min. The absor-
bance  of  the  solution  was  measured  spectrophotometrically
at  562 nm.  The  percent  inhibition  of  ferrozine-Fe2+  complex
formation was calculated using the following formula:

Metal chelating effect (%) = [(Acontrol

− Asample)/Acontrol] × 100

where Acontrol is the  absorbance  of the control (control  con-
tained  FeCl2  and  ferrozine;  complex  formation  molecules)
and  Asample  is  the  absorbance  of  the  test  compound.  BHT
and TOC were used as positive controls.

Analysis of phenolic compounds. Fifteen standard phe-
nolic compounds, including gallic acid, pyrogallol, homogen-
tisic  acid,  protocatechuic  acid,  (+)  catechin,  chlorogenic
acid,  caffeic  acid,  vanillin,  ferulic  acid,  naringin,  resvera-
trol,  naringenin,  hesperetin,  formononetin,  and  biochanin-
A, were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used for cali-
bration curves. The standard stock solutions (50, 100, 250,
and  500 ppm)  were  prepared  in  DMSO.  Sample  com-
pounds  were  identified  based  on  retention  times  of  authen-
tic standards and were quantified by comparing their peak
areas with those of the standard curves.

Sample  preparation  for  the  phenolic  compound  analy-
sis  followed  Kim  et  al.  [14].  Two  grams  of  dried  mush-
room  powder  was  mixed  with  10 mL  of  acetonitrile  and
2 mL  of  0.1 N  hydrochloric  acid,  followed  by  stirring  at
150 rpm for 2 hr at room temperature and filtration through
Whatman  No.  42  filter  paper.  The  extract  was  freeze-
dried, and the residues were redissolved in 10 mL of 80%
aqueous  methanol  (HPLC  grade)  and  filtered  through  a
0.45 µm  nylon  membrane  filter  (Titan,  Rockwood,  TN,
USA). The filtrate (20 µL) was then loaded onto an Agilent-
1100  series  liquid  chromatography  HPLC  system  (Agilent
Technologies,  Waldbronn,  Germany).  Separation  was
achieved on a 250 nm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 µm, YMC-Pack ODS
AM  (YMC  Co.  Ltd.,  Kyoto,  Japan)  column.  The  mobile
phase  was  distilled  water  with  0.1%  glacial  acetic  acid
(solvent  A)  and  acetonitrile  with  0.1%  glacial  acetic  acid
(solvent B). The  gradient was 0 min, 92% A;  0~2 min, 90%
A; 2~27 min, 70% A; 27~50 min, 10% A; 50~51 min, 0%
A; 51~60 min, 0% A; 60~63 min, 92% A. The run time was
60 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Detection was performed
using a diode array detector at a wavelength of 280 nm.

In  vitro  XO  inhibitory  activities  of  vari-
XO  inhibition.
ous  extracts  of  P.  citrinopileatus  fruiting  bodies  were
assayed  spectrophotometrically  under  aerobic  conditions
using  xanthine  as  the  substrate  [6].  The  assay  mixture
consisted  of  1 mL  of  extract  at  different  concentrations
(0.5~8.0 mg/mL),  2.9 mL  of  phosphate  buffer  (pH  7.5),

and 0.1 mL of XO enzyme solution (0.1 units/mL in phos-
phate  buffer,  pH  7.5),  which  was  prepared  immediately
before  use.  After  pre-incubation  at  25oC  for  15 min,  the
reaction  was  initiated  by  the  addition  of  2 mL  of  the  sub-
strate  solution  (150 µM  xanthine  in  the  same  buffer).  The
assay mixture was then incubated at 25oC for 30 min. The
reaction  was  stopped  by  the  addition  of  1 mL  of  1 N
hydrochloric  acid,  and  the  absorbance  was  measured  at
290 nm  using  a  spectrophotometer.  Different  concentra-
tions  of  the  extracts  were  dissolved  in  DMSO,  and  the
final  concentration  of  DMSO  was  5%,  which  did  not
affect  the  enzyme  assay.  Proper  controls  with  DMSO
were  carried  out.  Allopurinol  (0.5~8.0 mg/mL),  a  known
inhibitor  of  XO,  was  used  as  a  positive  control.  One  unit
of  XO  is  the  amount  of  enzyme  required  to  produce
1 mmol of uric acid/min at 25oC. XO inhibitory activity is
expressed  as  the  percent  inhibition  of  XO  in  the  above
assay system calculated as

Inhibition (%) = [(A − B) − (C − D)/(A − B)] × 100

where  A  is  the  activity  of  the  enzyme  without  the  extrac-
tion,  B  is  the  control  of  A  without  the  extraction  and
enzyme,  and  C  and  D  are  the  activities  of  the  extraction
with and without XO, respectively.

Tyrosinase  inhibition. Tyrosinase  inhibition  activity  was
determined  using  the  modified  dopachrome  method  with
L-DOPA  as  the  substrate  [15].  A  96-well  microtiter  plate
was  used  to  measure  absorbance  at  475 nm  with  700 nm
as  a  reference.  Extract  fractions  were  dissolved  in  50%
DMSO. Each well contained 40 µL of sample with 80 µL
of  phosphate  buffer  (0.1 M,  pH  6.8),  40 µL  of  tyrosinase
(31 units/mL), and 40 µL of L-DOPA (2.5 mM). The mix-
ture  was  incubated  for  10 min  at  37oC,  and  the  absorbance
was measured at 475 nm using a UVM 340 microplate reader
(Asys,  Eugendrof,  Austria).  Each  sample  was  accompanied
by  a  blank  containing  all  of  the  components  except  L-
DOPA.  L-ascorbic  acid  and  kojic  acid  were  used  as  posi-
tive  controls.  The  results  were  compared  with  a  control
consisting of 50% DMSO in place of the sample. The  per-
centage of tyrosinase inhibition was calculated as follows:

[(Acontrol

− Asample)/Acontrol] × 100

Statistical  analysis. Data  were  expressed  as  means ±
SDs  of  three  replicate  determinations  and  were  analyzed
by  SPSS  ver.  13  (SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  IL,  USA).  One-way
analysis of variance and Duncan’s new multiple-range test
were used to determine the differences among the means.

radical  adducts  of  carotenoids  with  free  radicals  from
linoleic  acid.  Linoleic  acid  free  radical  attacks  highly
unsaturated  β-carotene.  The  antioxidant  activities  of  the
acetone,  methanol,  and  hot  water  extracts  of  P.  citrino-
pileatus  fruiting  bodies  against  β-carotene-linoleic  acid
gradually increased with increasing concentration. At 0.5~
20.0 mg/mL, the antioxidant activities of the acetone, meth-
anol,  and  hot  water  extracts  of  P.  citrinopileatus  ranged
from  71.46~96.12,  71.85~96.52,  and  69.46~91.42%,  re-
spectively  (Table  1).  The  results  indicate  that  the  anti-
oxidant  activities  of  P.  citrinopileatus  were  lower  than
those of synthetic antioxidants, BHT and TOC, at 0.5 mg/
mL.  However,  the  methanol  and  acetone  extracts  showed
high  antioxidant  activities  at  the  concentrations  tested,
whereas  hot  water  extract  showed  moderate  activity.  The
presence  of  carotenoids  not  only  decreased  the  con-
centration  of  free  radicals  but  also  reduced  Fe3+  to  Fe2+.
The  antioxidative  components  in  mushroom  extracts  can
reduce  the  extent  of  β-carotene  destruction  by  neu-
tralizing  linoleate  free  radical  and  other  free  radicals
formed in the system [16]. Barros et al. [17] reported that
the  antioxidant  activities  of  various  extracts  of  Leucopax-
illus giganteus, Sarcodon imbricatus, and  Agaricus arven-
sis  increased  with  increasing  concentration.  Their  anti-
oxidant activities were 61.4, 54.3, and 46.7% at 5 mg/mL,
respectively,  whereas  the  antioxidant  activity  of  tertiary
butylhydroquinone standard reached 82.2% at 2 mg/mL. It
seems  that  the  antioxidant  activity  of  P.  citrinopileatus
fruiting  bodies  was  more  effective  than  those  mentioned
above.

Reducing  power. The  reducing  power  of  the  acetone,
methanol, and hot water extracts of P. citrinopileatus fruit-
ing  bodies  increased  readily  with  increasing  concentration.
At  8 mg/mL,  the  strongest  reducing  power  was  observed
in the  methanol extract, with a  value  of 2.92, whereas the
lowest  reducing  power  (2.63)  was  exhibited  by  acetone
extract.  However,  the  reducing  power  values  of  BHT  and
TOC at 1.0 mg/mL were 3.21 and 2.16, respectively (Table
2).

Regarding the hot water extracts, the reducing power of
Hypsizygus  marmoreus  was  0.99  at  5 mg/mL,  whereas
Agricus  bisporus,  Pleurotus  eryngii,  Pleurotus  ferulae,
and  Pleurotus  ostreatus  showed  reducing  power  levels  of
0.76, 0.75, 0.70, and 0.61, respectively, at 20 mg/mL [18].
Our  results  indicate  that  the  reducing  power  of  P.  citrino-
pileatus  was  higher  and  significantly  more  effective  com-
pared  to  those  of  other  mushrooms.  It  was  reported  that
reducing  power  properties  are  generally  associated  with
the  presence  of  reductones,  which  have  been  shown  to
exert antioxidant action by donating a hydrogen atom and
breaking the free radical chain [5, 19].

Scavenging  of  DPPH  radicals. The  DPPH  radical  scav-
enging  activities  of  the  acetone,  methanol,  and  hot  water
extracts of P. citrinopileatus fruiting bodies increased with
increasing  concentration.  At  0.125~2.0 mg/mL,  the  DPPH
radical scavenging activities of the acetone, methanol, and
hot water extracts ranged from 52.56~92.65, 58.65~90.46,
and  43.47~95.34%,  respectively  (Fig.  1).  However,  at
0.125~2.0 mg/mL, BHT, TOC, and L-ascorbic acid showed

excellent  scavenging  activities  of  85.25~98.74,  67.37~97.78,
and 96.74~98.23%, respectively.

tion,  the  lowest  chelating  effect  was  exhibited  by  the  hot
water extract (89.45%).

Lee  et  al.  [18]  reported  that  the  ethanol  extracts  of  H.
marmoreus and A. bisporus fruiting bodies scavenge DPPH
radicals  at  rates  between  46.6~68.4%  at  5 mg/mL.  The
scavenging  activities  of  the  fruiting  bodies,  mycelia,  and
filtrate  of  the  cold  and  hot  water  extracts  were  20.7~52.3,
37.6~48.3,  and  19.6~23.3%,  respectively,  at  20 mg/mL.  It
seems  that  the  scavenging  activity  of  P.  citrinopileatus
fruiting  bodies  was  more  effective  than  those  mentioned
above. Various extracts might react with free radicals, par-
ticularly  peroxy  radicals,  which  are  the  major  propagators
of  the  fat  autoxidation  chain,  thereby  terminating  the  chain
reaction  [20].  The  antioxidant  capacity  of  natural  antioxi-
dants  is  due  to  the  termination  of  the  free  radical  reaction
[19]. Furthermore, Herraiz et al. [21] found that the essen-
tial  amino  acid  L-tryptophan  could  react  with  phenolic
aldehydes  in  food  to  form  phenolic  tetrahydro-β-carboline
alkaloids,  which  scavenges  2,2-azinobis  (3-ethylbenzothia-
zoline)-6-sulfonic  acid  effectively.  Therefore,  the  presence
of  L-tryptophan  in  various  extracts  might  account  for  the
scavenging  activity  of  DPPH  radicals.  However,  the  higher
scavenging activity of the acetone extract might have been
due  to  more  hydrogen-donating  components  contained
within the extracts.

Chelation  of  ferrous  ions. The  chelating  activities  of  the
acetone,  methanol,  and  hot  water  extracts  at  five  different
concentrations  (0.063,  0.125,  0.250,  0.500,  and  1.000 mg/
mL)  of  the  P.  citrinopileatus  fruiting  bodies  toward  fer-
rous ion were investigated. BHT and TOC were used as a
ferrous  ion  standard.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  chelating
capacity  of  the  extracts  increased  with  increasing  concen-
tration. The strongest chelating effect (92.72%) was obtained
with  the  acetone  extract  at  1.0 mg/mL.  At  this  concentra-

With  regard  to  hot  water  extracts  at  20 mg/mL,  Gano-
derma tsugae and Agrocybe cylindracea were observed to
chelate  ferrous  ions  at  rates  of  42.6  and  45.8%,  respec-
tively  [22, 23].  At  1~5 mg/mL,  the  chelating  ability  of  H.
marmoreus  is  75.6~92.6%  [18].  It  seems  that  the  chelat-
ing  of  ferrous  ion  by  P.  citrinopileatus  was  significantly
higher  and  more  effective  compared  to  that  of  previously
mentioned mushroom. Chelating agents may serve as sec-
ondary  antioxidants,  as  they  reduce  redox  potential  and
stabilize the oxidized forms of metal ions. As ferrous ions
are  the  most  effective  pro-oxidants  in  the  food  system
[24],  the  high  ferrous  ion-chelating  ability  of  the  various
extracts of P. citrinopileatus fruiting bodies could be bene-
ficial.

Analysis  of  phenolic  compounds. Gallic  acid,  pyrogallol,
homogentisic acid, protocatechuic acid, (+) catechin, chlo-
rogenic  acid,  caffeic  acid,  vanillin,  ferulic  acid,  naringin,
resveratrol,  naringenin,  hesperetin,  formononetin,  and  bio-
chanin-A  were  used  as  standards  to  detect  phenolic  com-
pounds  in  the  P.  citrinopileatus  extract.  Twelve  phenolic
compounds,  gallic  acid,  protocatechuic  acid,  chlorogenic
acid,  caffeic  acid,  vanillin,  ferulic  acid,  naringin,  resvera-
trol,  naringenin,  hesperetin,  formononetin,  and  biochanin-
A,  were  detected  in  an  acetonitrile  and  hydrochloric  acid
(5 : 1)  solvent  extract.  The  total  phenolic  compound  con-
tent  was  345 µg/g.  The  highest  and  lowest  concentrations
of  phenolic  compounds  were  recorded  in  protocatechuic
acid  (85 µg/g)  and  formononetin  and  biochanin-A  (14 µg/
g), respectively (Fig. 3). These findings are comparable to
previous  studies  on  edible  mushroom  [3],  in  which  the
total  phenolic  compound  concentration  was  found  to  be
174 µg/g.  Mushroom  species  also  contain  from  3  to  15

phenolic  compounds,  whereas  gallic  acid  is  a  commonly
reported  phenolic  compound  in  mushrooms.  Thus,  the
phenolic  compound  content  could  be  used  as  an  impor-
tant  indicator  of  the  antioxidant  capacity.  Several  reports
have  convincingly  shown  a  close  relationship  between
antioxidant  activity  and  phenolic  content  [25, 26].  Mush-
room  extracts  contain  high  levels  of  phenolic  compounds,
which  are  composed  of  one  or  more  aromatic  rings  bear-
ing  one  or  more  hydroxyl  groups  and  can  exhibit  exten-
sive  free  radical-scavenging  activities  as  hydrogen  donors
or  electron-donating  agents,  as  well  as  metal  ion-chelat-
ing  properties.  The  greater  number  of  hydroxyl  groups  in

phenolics could increase the antioxidant activity [27].

XO inhibitory activity. XO inhibitory activities of vari-
ous  extracts  of  P.  citrinopileatus  increased  with  increas-
ing  concentration.  At  0.5~8.0 mg/mL,  the  XO  inhibitory
activities  of  the  acetone,  methanol,  and  hot  water  extracts
were  in  the  range  from  3.82~43.86,  3.91~41.63,  and  2.52~
44.03%,  respectively,  whereas  allopurinol  showed  excel-
lent  XO  inhibitory  activity  from  92.31~94.58%  (Fig.  4).
However, at higher doses of the extract, XO would be sig-
nificantly  inhibited.  Flavonoids  are  a  group  of  polyphe-
nolic  compounds  that  have  been  reported  to  possess  XO

tors  act  through  hydroxyl  groups  that  bind  to  the  tyrosi-
nase  active  site,  resulting  in  steric  hindrance  or  altered
conformation  [29].  Gallic  acid  is  an  effective  tyrosinase
activity  inhibitor  [30].  The  antioxidant  activity  mechanism
may also be an important reason for the inhibition activity.

inhibitory  activity  [28].  Hence,  the  presence  of  phenolic
and  flavonoid  compounds  in  the  extract  could  have  con-
tributed towards XO inhibition.

Tyrosinase inhibition. Tyrosinase inhibitory activities of
the  acetone,  methanol,  and  hot  water  extracts  of  the  fruit-
ing  bodies  of  P.  citrinopileatus  increased  with  increasing
concentration.  At  0.125~1.0 mg/mL,  the  tyrosinase  inhibi-
tory  activities  of  the  acetone,  methanol,  and  hot  water
extracts ranged from 16.21~55.44, 18.93~54.12, and 11.45~
60.68%,  respectively  (Fig.  5).  However,  at  0.125~1.0 mg/
mL, L-ascorbic acid and kojic acid showed excellent tyro-
sinase  inhibitory  activities  of  75.12~92.74  and  91.23~
99.00%,  respectively.  The  inhibition  of  tyrosinase  might
depend  on  the  number  of  hydroxyl  groups  in  the  phe-
nolic  compounds  from  the  mushroom  extracts  that  are
available  to  form  a  hydrogen  bond  with  an  enzyme  site,
leading to lower enzymatic activity. Some tyrosinase inhibi-
