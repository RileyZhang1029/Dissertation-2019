Users can supply their data in open and standardized ﬁle formats for retention time alignment using dynamic time warping with different conﬁgurable local distance and similarity functions.
Additionally, user-deﬁned anchors can be used to constrain and speedup the alignment.
A neighborhood around each anchor can be added to increase the ﬂexibility of the constrained alignment.
ChromA offers different visualizations of the alignment for easier qualitative interpretation and comparison of the data.
For the multiple alignment of more than two data ﬁles, the center-star approximation is applied to select a reference among input ﬁles to align to.
Availability: ChromA is available at http://bibiserv.techfak.uni- bielefeld.de/chroma.
Executables and source code under the L-GPL v3 license are provided for download at the same location.

1 INTRODUCTION Modern analytical methods in biology and chemistry use separation techniques coupled to sensitive detectors, such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
These hyphenated methods provide high-dimensional data.
Comparing such data manually to ﬁnd corresponding signals is a tedious task, as each experiment usually consists of thousands of individual scans, each containing hundreds or even thousands of distinct signals.
In order  to allow successful  identiﬁcation of metabolites or proteins within such data, especially in the context of metabolomics and proteomics, an accurate alignment and matching of corresponding features between two or more experiments is required.
Such a matching algorithm should capture ﬂuctuations in the chromatographic system which lead to non-linear distortions on the time axis (Strehmel et al., 2008).
Many different algorithms for the alignment of GC-MS/LC-MS data have been proposed and published, but only some of them are easily accessible or contained in publicly available toolkits (De Vos et al., 2007  Jonsson et al., 2005, 2006  Kohlbacher et al.,     To whom correspondence should be addressed.
2007  Smith et al., 2006  Sturm et al., 2008).
The tool presented here, ChromA, is immediately accessible for pairwise alignment and easy to use via the web frontend (see Supplementary Fig.
1) and as a web service.
It provides different visual representations of the alignment, focusing on differences and similarities between the chromatograms.
We additionally offer ChromA as an immediately deployable JAVAtm Web Start application and for download as a platform-independent command-line tool.
These allow alignment of more than two chromatograms, using the center-star approximation to select a reference chromatogram among all input ﬁles to align to.
To compute the pairwise alignment, we use dynamic time warping (DTW) due to its applicability to data with non-linear time scale distortions (Itakura, 1975  Kruskal and Liberman, 1999  Sakoe and Chiba, 1978).
It is suitable to globally align chromatograms, which are sequences of mass spectra.
Every mass spectrum is preprocessed to nominal mass bin accuracy.
In contrast to other methods (Robinson et al., 2007), there is no need for a priori selection of peaks for alignment, but a priori knowledge can be used to improve and speedup the alignment.
1990)  netcdf ﬁles  (Rew and Davis,  following and Miller, 2000)  2 DATA MANAGEMENT AND METHODS Currently, the ASTM/AIA/ANDI-MS standard (Matthews and xml ﬁles following the mzXML format (Pedrioli et al., 2004) can be read.
Aligned chromatograms are stored in netcdf ﬁles, whereas general processing results, statistics and status information are saved in tab-separated value text format for easier access.
All ﬁles generated during a run of ChromA, their creator and their designation (preprocessing, alignment, visualization, etc.
), are stored in an xml ﬁle to allow an easy integration with data curation and analysis platforms for metabolomic experiments, for example, MeltDB (Neuweger et al., 2008).
intensity vectors,  In our software, we included different local distance and similarity functions between mass spectral like the Euclidean distance, cosine similarity and linear correlation (Prince and Marcotte, 2006), to calculate a retention time alignment of chromatograms with DTW.
Additionally, we included the Hamming distance on binarized vectors and a very fast function based on squared difference of total ion current (TIC) (Reiner et al., 1979), which is available for quick evaluation.
Depending on the local function used, we apply different weights to provide a smooth warping.
ChromA allows the user to deﬁne a number of optional conﬁguration choices.
As a preprocessing step, intensities contained in user- deﬁned mass bins may be removed from consideration by the alignment.
Additionally, manually or automatically matched peaks (Robinson et al., 2007  Styczynski et al., 2007) may be included as anchors to constrain the alignment to pass through their positions (see Supplementary Fig.
2).

[13:18 4/8/2009 Bioinformatics-btp343.tex]  Page: 2080  2080 2081   Even though the worst case complexity of DTW is still of order O(m2) in space and time, where m is the number of scans in a chromatogram, we can achieve large speedups in practice.
An alignment of two chromatograms with about 5400 scans each, 500 nominal mass bins, 38 deﬁned anchors and a maximum scan deviation of 10% (about 540 scans to the left and right of the diagonal) using the cosine score as local similarity was calculated in 12 s on a MacBook with 2.4 GHz Core2 Duo processor, using around 500 MB of memory.
Without any constraints, the same alignment was calculated in 7 min.
The multiple alignment of 20 chromatograms using the center- star approximation required computation of 190 pairwise alignments.
Using the aforementioned constraints, it was calculated within 40 min, without constraints in  24 h.  With the introduction of anchors to DTW, we address one major issue of peak-alignment algorithms, namely the problem of prior peak detection, by allowing strong peak candidates, such as reference compounds with unique mass traces (LC-MS) or characteristic fragmentation patterns (GC-MS), to be included, but at the same time allowing an alignment of weaker peaks.
To allow the alignment additional ﬂexibility, a neighborhood of radius n can be deﬁned for all anchors.
3 VISUALIZATIONS ChromA provides a number of visualizations for alignments, variable data and chromatograms, which are generated using the open source library JFreeChart (Gilbert and Morgner, 2009).
In order to visualize alignments, we implemented different chart types.
Figure 1 shows a plot of the TIC of the second chromatogram below the ﬁrst chromatogram s TIC after alignment.
Corresponding peaks are easily spotted with this visualization, as well as peaks that are only present in one of the chromatograms.
We additionally provide visualizations of a multiple alignment of TICs before and after the alignment using the Web Start version of ChromA (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4), as well as an exemplary mass sensitive visualization of nominal mass 73 (silylation agent) before and after the alignment (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6).
