Abstract
Understanding the progression of a primary cancer to the metastatic stage has been the focus of extensive
research for years. Commonly accepted concepts in this process (i.e., that of genetic instability and loss of
normal cellular constraints on growth and motility) are well established. Other important paradigms,
such as the necessary change from an epithelial cell phenotype displaying cell-cell adhesions to a singular
and motile mesenchymal-like cell phenotype (possibly derived from a stem cell-like cell) via a process
similar to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), are less well understood. In this review we will
address studies linking EMT and cancer stem cells during cancer development and observations that are
challenging these concepts.

Introduction and context
In normal cells, a tight coordination between cell adhe-
sion and signaling exists, manifested by a dependence
on anchorage for growth. As cancer cells often display
anchorage-independent growth,
the key question is,
what is the nature of the changes in this coordination
between adhesion and signaling in cancerous cells?
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes a
series of events originally recognized in embryogenesis
and involves changes in epithelial cells that give rise
to mesenchymal cells [1]. Elizabeth Hay described
mesenchymal cells as “bipolar cells with a filopodia-
rich front end capable of invading the extracellular
matrix (ECM)…and at
the very least, with motile
morphology” [2]. While numerous changes in molecular
markers occur during EMT, these are not universal to all
EMT cases [2].

Many of the phenotypic changes occurring during EMT
are reminiscent of those seen in adenocarcinoma cells
during cancer progression, which involve an invasion of
the ECM and movement away from the primary tumor
to form distant metastases. This invasiveness is funda-
mental to both EMT in embryogenesis and malignant

tumor development, and the activation of key transcrip-
tion factors and expression of other marker genes
common to both processes supports the idea that EMT
is pathologically reactivated during malignant transfor-
mation [3].

Embryogenesis and tumorigenesis are, however, dis-
tinct
in important ways: while embryogenesis is a
highly ordered process that creates a functional orga-
nism,
tumor progression is often disordered and
unpredictable. With this in mind, Kalluri and Wein-
berg [4] suggested a system for distinguishing similar
processes involving cell plasticity and motility from
one another by dividing EMT into several subtypes [4].
In addition, recent studies suggest that only a small
subpopulation of carcinoma cells, the ‘cancer stem
cells’ (CSCs) both sustain tumor growth and promote
metastasis [5]. We will focus on current advances in
understanding the regulation of these processes.

Major recent advances
Until recently, the accepted dogma in cancer research
was that replicating epithelial cells accumulate several
rounds of mutations that eventually lead to cancerous

transformation [6]. This idea has recently been chal-
lenged by the identification of CSCs, which provide a
new means for both the initiation and propagation of
tumorigenesis. Since stem cells can self renew, prolifer-
ate, and differentiate, these properties can explain both
the unrestricted growth and the differentiated patterns
seen in malignant tumors [5]. The Wnt/b-catenin sign-
aling pathway was shown to regulate both self-renewal
and oncogenesis in different tissues [5]. Furthermore,
cells at the invasive front of colorectal carcinomas often
express a CSC phenotype, characterized by loss of
E-cadherin and nuclear b-catenin localization, an indica-
tion of active Wnt signaling (Figure 1B and [7]).

Both the EMT and CSC concepts address key aspects of
carcinogenesis, and Mani et al. [8] showed that they can
be linked to each other. By overexpressing the major EMT
regulators Snail and Twist
in immortalized human
mammary epithelial cells, they induced an EMT-like
state (decreased E-cadherin and increased expression of
mesenchymal markers) and showed that these cells had
an increased ability to form mammospheres (balls of

Figure 1. Colon cancer cells at the invasive front of the tumor
display loss of cell-cell contacts, reminiscent of an epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT)

Colon cancer cells express unique proteins (such as L1-CAM and the
phosphorylated form of the nuclear factor-kappa B [NF-kB] subunit, p-65-P)
not found in the more differentiated areas of the tumor. (A and B) Serial
tissue sections showed staining (brown) for L1-CAM in the membrane of
foremost invading cells (A) with marked nuclear staining of b-catenin

non-adherent cells capable of differentiation), a property
normally associated with mammary epithelial stem cells.
They isolated cell populations from mouse mammary
glands, human reduction mammoplasty tissues, and
mammary carcinomas that express stem cell markers
(CD44high/CD24low), and demonstrated that these cells
also display mesenchymal markers. Their ability to
isolate mesenchymal-like breast cells from normal breast
tissue, without evidence for tumors or metastases, points
to the inherent plasticity of adult epithelial tissue cells,
and shows that normal adult stem cells that underwent
an EMT are similar to mesenchymal stem cells [9]. The
epithelial phenotype is easily amenable to manipulation
in both non-transformed [10] and carcinoma cells [11]
by simply changing the density of cell cultures, further
demonstrating the plasticity of epithelial cells. Support-
ing a link between EMT and CSCs in mouse mammary
tumors, the homeobox transcription factor Six1 (when
activated in transgenic mice) induced an EMT-like
conversion and caused mammary gland cancer by
increasing the population of cells displaying CSC
markers, and included the activation of Wnt/b-catenin
signaling [12].

Another exciting advance involves the description of new
roles for E-cadherin in cancer progression. Transgenic
mice with conditionally disrupted E-cadherin function in
type II alveolar epithelial cells were crossed with mice
that form benign lung adenomas due to a RAS mutation
[13]. Disruption of E-cadherin in the offsprings induced
invasive carcinoma that metastasized into regional
lymph nodes and bone marrow and promoted angio-
genesis. This revealed a novel function of E-cadherin in
angiogenesis and in tumor progression [13].

Even more remarkably, the systemic spread of cancer
cells was shown to be an early step in oncogenesis in
mammary cancer. Untransformed mouse mammary cells
engineered to express inducible oncogenes were intrave-
nously injected into mice, who subsequently developed
pulmonary metastases after the cells had implanted in
the lungs and the oncogenes were induced [14,15]. These
tumors expressed normal epithelial markers. Thus, cell
transformation in the primary tumor can be bypassed
and is not required for metastasis. Since breast cancer
cells have been found in the circulation of patients with
small, non-invasive tumors, these findings suggest that
metastases may develop in vivo without a classic EMT.

Another major change in our view of the way cancer
develops is the realization that cancer cells are no longer
considered the only player in cancer progression. The
cancer microenvironment,
fibro-
blasts, endothelial cells, and bone-marrow-derived

including stromal

inflammatory cells, interact with cancer cells to promote
cell migration, invasion, and metastasis [16,17]. For
example, cysteine cathepsins secreted by tumor-asso-
ciated macrophages cleave E-cadherin at the cancer cell
surface and promote EMT [16]. Also, cells in the cancer
microenvironment often secrete metalloproteases that
breakdown the ECM and allow cancer cell invasion [16].

Inflammation-associated signaling pathways play a key
role in metastasis development [17]. In some cancers,
tumor-associated fibroblasts express proinflammatory
genes very early in the tumorigenic process, promoting
macrophage recruitment, neovascularization, and tumor
growth – all of which are abolished when nuclear factor-
kappa B (NF-kB) signaling is inhibited [18]. NF-kB
signaling was shown to be essential in breast cancer
development, where it stabilizes Snail, a major EMT
regulator [19]. In colon cancer, the L1-CAM-mediated
metastasis to the liver was blocked when NF-kB signaling
was inhibited (Figure 1D) [20].

Finally, a recent study has linked CSCs, EMT, and the
tumor microenvironment in colon cancer progression and
metastasis [21]. Activation of Wnt target genes (demon-
strated by nuclear b-catenin localization [Figure 1B]), was
shown to be a marker for colon CSCs, defined by a set of
specific ‘cluster of differentiation’ (CD) markers in these
cells and their clonogenic capacity. The co-culturing of
myofibroblasts with such CSCs prevented their differ-
entiation and resulted in the loss of clonogenicity.
Moreover, differentiated colon cancer cells were repro-
grammed to express CSC markers and regained their
tumorigenicity when stimulated with myofibroblast-
derived factors, further emphasizing the plasticity of
normal and cancer cell phenotypes [21].

the dynamic three-dimensional

Future directions
The most challenging aspect in the study of cancer
progression is to develop models enabling the visualiza-
tion of
interactions
between cancer cells in vivo, similar to some models
used to visualize cell motility during embryogenesis.
Pathologists rarely observe EMT in cancer tissues, and the
invading cells in the surrounding stroma appear epithe-
lial and not mesenchymal, and for the most part do not
express stem cell markers. The question is: have these
cells undergone a “radical change in cell identity” [22]?
The answer to this question is critical for a deeper
understanding of the biology of cancer and remains one
of the hotly debated issues in the cancer-EMT field.

Controversy also surrounds the definition and identifi-
cation of CSCs, or tumor-initiating cells [23]. CSCs
express a set of markers common to non-transformed

stem cells, and when CSCs are isolated and injected in
small numbers they can initiate tumor formation in
mice. Other investigators have found that CSCs can be
isolated by the expression of CD markers, which change
as the phenotype of the cancer cell alters (i.e., cells
that metastasize express a different set of CD markers
compared to those that do not metastasize). In both
cases, it remains unclear from where CSCs arise, how
they are classified and identified, and whether they exist
at all
the functional
significance of the CDs may be. Future studies on the
link between CSCs and the necessity of an EMT-like
process during cancer progression will undoubtedly
remain an exciting research topic at
the front of
molecular cancer research in the near future.
