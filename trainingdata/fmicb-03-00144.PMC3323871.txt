The ability of honey to kill bacterial pathogens in vitro and quickly clear even chronic or
drug-resistant infections has been demonstrated by several studies. Most current research
is focused on identifying the bactericidal compounds in honey, but the action of the
compounds discovered is not sufﬁcient to explain honey’s activity. By diluting honey to
sub-inhibitory levels, we were able to study its impact on bacterial coordinated behavior,
and discovered that honey inhibits bacterial quorum sensing (QS). Experiments to character-
ize and quantify honey’s effect on the QS networks of Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed
that low concentrations of honey inhibited the expression of MvfR, las, and rhl regulons,
including the associated virulence factors. This research also establishes that inhibition of
QS is associated with honey’s sugar content. Therefore, honey combats infections by two
independent mechanisms acting in tandem: bactericidal components, which actively kill
cells, and disruption of QS, which weakens bacterial coordination and virulence.

INTRODUCTION
A critical problem facing modern medicine is the emergence
of many strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Tomasz, 1994;
Arias and Murray, 2009; So et al., 2010). The most dangerous
of these are multi-drug-resistant “superbugs,” strains impervi-
ous to almost all known antibiotics. One example is the human
opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative
bacterium notorious for infecting immunocompromised individ-
uals, the cause of many nosocomial acquired infections including
those caused in burn and cystic ﬁbrosis patients. In recent years,
strains of P. aeruginosa have appeared that resist virtually all
known drugs (Aloush et al., 2005), a situation exacerbated by
the fact that there are almost no new antibiotics against Gram-
negative bacteria in the pipeline (Cornelis, 2008; Freire-Moran
et al., 2011).

Honey, known for its medicinal uses since ancient times (Zumla
and Luat, 1989), has attracted new attention in the ﬁght against
drug-resistant bacteria. It was found to be very effective against
various clinical isolates of bacteria, and to boost the effect of
current antibiotics when applied to antibiotic disks (Abd-El Aal
et al., 2007; Kwakman et al., 2008). Recent research has shown
that when tested against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus
and P. aeruginosa, honey killed free-living cells in all strains tested
(Alandejani et al., 2009). More importantly it was capable of killing
bacteria even in their highly resistant bioﬁlm state, proving more
effective than any single commonly used antibiotic (rifampin,
cefazolin, oxacillin, vancomycin, azithromycin, fusidic acid, gen-
tamicin, and linezolid were tested). In addition to attacking various

pathogens in vitro, clinical studies have shown that honey enhances
healing and eliminates even chronic or drug-resistant infections
in vivo (Efem, 1988). Honey was also reported to be more effec-
tive than standard treatments for patients with infected burns
(Wijesinghe et al., 2009).

Honey’s antimicrobial properties are still not fully understood.
Bees produce honey from ﬂower nectar by evaporating water and
adding digestive enzymes (Crane, 1975). The two largest con-
stituents of honey are sugars (81%) and water (17%; White et al.,
1962; Jeffrey and Echazarretta, 1996). The remaining 1–2% con-
tains various enzymes and compounds, whose composition plays
a signiﬁcant role in honey’s bactericidal activity and varies widely
depending on nectar source (Molan, 1999). Attempts to identify
the source of bactericidal activity has led to the discovery of mol-
ecules such as methylglyoxal and bee-defensin 1 (Kwakman et al.,
2010), but accurately characterizing their effects is difﬁcult due
to the large number of trace components and the possibility of
combinatorial effects.

Quorum sensing (QS) is a term describing bacterial commu-
nication used by many bacterial species and its based on the
production and detection of diffusible signal molecules (Atkinson
and Williams, 2009). These molecules trigger signaling cascades,
resulting in collective changes in behavior. Inhibition of QS would
disrupt defensive measures and regulation of virulence, both weak-
ening an infection and making it much more vulnerable to bac-
tericidal elements. Moreover, as QS is not essential to survival,
a strategy to inhibit it would reduce virulence while minimizing
selection for resistance.

Honey impacts quorum sensing

Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses two known QS systems: (1) the
acyl-homoserine-lactone (AHL) LasR/RhlR network (Fuqua et al.,
2001; Shiner et al., 2005) and (2) the 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines
(HAQs) MvfR regulatory network (Gallagher et al., 2002; Déziel
et al., 2004; Wade et al., 2005). MvfR is critical for full virulence
and leads to the positive regulation of a wide variety of virulence
factors, many of which are also inﬂuenced by RhlR and LasR.
The bacterium uses these networks to modulate its virulence and
respond to environmental cues (Bassler, 1999; Déziel et al., 2005;
Hazan et al., 2010).

Here we show that non-bactericidal concentrations of honey
(6% or less) inhibit both known QS networks used by P. aerugi-
nosa by inhibiting the expression of genes in the MvfR, Las, and
Rhl networks and activation of associated virulence factors. Com-
bined with tests of bactericidal effects, this suggests that honey’s
ability to combat infections stems from two separate mechanisms:
(1) bactericidal effect from unique molecules (which have not been
conclusively identiﬁed) that are nectar source dependent, and (2)
effects on QS systems that are associated with sugar content and
independent of nectar source.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
HONEY
Two honeys of different bactericidal strength were used in these
experiments. Local honey (LH) was harvested from a hive of
Italian honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica), as a representative
of an average honey. Manuka honey (MH), made from the
nectar of Leptospermum scoparium or L. polygalifolium, was
purchased from Manuka Health New Zealand (grade MGO
550 or 550 mg/kg methylglyoxal, batch NO. 030308). MH is
known for its unusually strong bactericidal properties (Molan,
1999).

The honeys were either used raw or heat-treated for 20 min
at 100˚C to inactivate any enzymes present (Ahern and Klibanov,
1985), almost entirely eliminating bactericidal activity.

In experiments requiring dilutions the concentrations typically

used were 2, 4, or 6% in 5 mL of Luria–Bertani (LB) broth.

BACTERIA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains used were wild-type PA14 (Rahme
et al., 1995) and derivative isogenic strains, including isogenic
mutant pqsA (Déziel et al., 2004) from the Rahme lab stock, Mass-
General-Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. Two types of reporter genes
were used: (1) a pqsA–GFP (ASV) fusion consisting of a pqsA
promoter upstream to a short live GFP (ASV) to allow detec-
tion of changes in pqs operon expression (Yang et al., 2007)
and (2) fusions of the lacZ promoter to lasI and rhlI (Cao
et al., 2001; Déziel et al., 2004, 2005). E. coli was the labora-
tory strain DH5α (NEB). All bacteria were grown in LB broth
at 37˚C.

MEDIA
LB broth was purchased from BD Diagnostics. M9 minimal media

was prepared by adding 200 mL M9 salts (64 g Na2HPO4·7H2O,
15 g KH2PO4, 2.5 g NaCl, 5 g NH4Cl in a total volume of 1000 mL
distilled water), 2 mL of 1 M sterile MgSO4, 20 mL of 20% glucose,
and 100 μL of 1 M sterile CaCl2 to 700 mL of distilled water and
adjusting the volume to 1000 mL.

BACTERIAL ZONE OF INHIBITION
The zone of inhibition on bacterial lawns was measured to com-
pare the bactericidal properties of different honeys. LB agar plates
were inoculated with bacterial lawns by plating out 100 μL of
overnight liquid culture. Single drops of honey (10 μL) were pipet-
ted onto these lawns. The plates were incubated 24 h at 37˚C and
the resulting clear areas around the drops were compared. Gen-
tamicin (60 μg/mL; Sigma) and double distilled water were used
as positive and negative controls respectively.

MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION AND MINIMUM
BACTERICIDAL CONCENTRATION DETERMINATION AND BACTERIAL
GROWTH
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of honey was
determined by growing bacteria in a 96-well plate. Each row of
wells contained a different type of honey or sugar, with initial con-
centrations of 60% honey or sugar and serial twofold dilutions
down the rows. After incubating overnight at 37˚C with no shak-
ing, the lowest concentration at which the broth remained clear
was deﬁned as the MIC. Media from the wells with no visible bac-
terial growth were plated onto LB plates to check for surviving
bacterial cells, and the lowest concentration that did not result in
bacterial colonies was deﬁned as the minimum bactericidal con-
centration (MBC). These concentrations were then compared to
determine relative efﬁcacy of the honey and sugar solutions tested.
The growth of bacteria in presence of different types of honey
or sugar was assessed after 18 h by measuring the optical den-
sity (OD600 nm) using a spectrophotometer (Genesys) at 600 nm.
Bacterial growth was calculated and reported as percentage of
treated/untreated cultures.

PYOCYANIN ASSAY
Cultures were grown in 5 mL of media overnight in tubes on
a roller at 37˚C. The following day samples were taken and
measured for OD600 nm. For pyocyanin extraction, bacterial cells
were removed from 1 mL of culture by centrifuging followed by
addition of 1 mL chloroform to the supernatant. Pyocyanin was
extracted by the addition of HCl (0.5%) and the upper reddish
phase was collected and its OD was measured at 520 nm (Hazan
et al., 2010). Both OD’s were plotted as percentages of the control
to account for differences in cell density.

pqsA–GFP ASSAY
A P. aeruginosa strain with a pqsA–GFP (ASV) fusion was grown
in 96-well black microtiter plates as previously described (Hazan
et al., 2010). Honey and sugar solutions were added to the media
in the wells to determine their impact on expression. The growth
and ﬂuorescence of the GFP (excitation at 485 nm and emission at
535 nm) were recorded using plate reader Inﬁnite F200 (Tecan).

LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROMETRY OF QS SIGNALING
MOLECULES
The quantiﬁcation of HAQ concentration in bacterial culture
supernatants was performed by liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) as described previously (Lépine et al.,
2003). The HAQs were separated on a C18 reverse-phase col-
umn connected to a mass spectrometer using a water/acetonitrile
gradient. Positive electrospray in the MRM mode with 2× 10

mTorr argon and 30 V as the collision gas were employed to
quantify HAQs using the ion transitions HHQ 244 > 159, HHQ-
D4 248 > 163, HQNO 260 > 159, PQS 260 > 175, and PQS-D4
264 > 179. The pseudomolecular ions of each compound were
monitored in full scan mode using the unsaturated PA14 HAQs
response factors.

β-GALACTOSIDASE ACTIVITY ASSAY
PA14 or isogenic mutant cultures carrying pGX5 (pqsA–lacZ ) were

grown overnight at 37˚C, diluted to OD600 = 0.01, and grown
at 37˚C; and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described
(Miller, 1972) at different time points. Brieﬂy, 0.9 mL of Z buffer
was added to 0.1 mL of a liquid culture. A drop of SDS (0.1%)
(cid:2)(cid:2)
and two drops of Chloroform were added followed by 15
vortex
and mixed with 0.2 mL of ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside;
4 mg/mL). Tubes were then vortexed, incubated until sufﬁcient
yellow color had developed and measured for optical density at
420 and 550 nm. Results were expressed in Miller units (MU).

PROTEASE ASSAY
Production of extracellular protease was tested using plates made
with brain heart infusion (BHI) and skim milk (Sokol et al., 1979).
To test the effects of honey, 4% MH was mixed in before pouring.

2 μL of PA14 culture at OD600 nm = 2.0. Plates were then incu-

bated room temperature (about 24˚C) for 48 h and resulting clear
halos were measured.

RESULTS
BACTERICIDAL EFFECT OF HONEY
Honeys have been shown to have strong bactericidal properties
against many species of bacteria that commonly infect wounds
(Willix et al., 2008). In order to determine whether inhibition of
QS is linked to this, we conﬁrmed previous information on the
nature of honey’s activity.

Firstly, it has been shown that the bactericidal effects of honey
far exceed those of comparable sugar solutions (Efem and Iwara,
1992). Our tests of MIC/MBC of honey relative to sugars revealed
that the minimum concentration of glucose or fructose required
to prevent growth of P. aeruginosa cells in liquid culture is roughly
fourfold that of honey, as shown in Table 1. This rules out osmotic
stress as a deciding factor in antibacterial activity.

Certain honeys are known to be unusually effective against
bacteria, a difference which is generally attributed to their nec-
tar source (Molan, 1992). We tested honeys on bacterial lawns
and conﬁrmed that MH has a signiﬁcantly larger zone of inhi-
bition than LH (data not shown). It is also known that heating
honey reduces or destroys its bactericidal activity (Molan, 1992),
as shown in Figure 1A. The difference between raw and heat-
treated MH is clearly visible – raw honey produces a clear zone of
17 mm diameter, while heat limits killing to a small area in direct
contact with the drop of honey (9 mm diameter). The decrease in
bactericidal activity of heated honey was visible with both PA14
and pqsA isogenic mutant (Figure 1A).

This conﬁrms the presence of bactericidal compounds separate from sugars.

bacterial virulence while possibly avoiding the selection pressure
that conventional antibiotics exert (Hentzer and Givskov, 2003).
Therefore, we tested whether honey directly affects the expression
of QS genes. We initially examined the activity of MvfR regulon
via pqsA, since its expression is under direct MvfR control (Déziel
et al., 2005). To this end we used GFP (ASV) as a reporter of the
pqsA gene expression (Hazan et al., 2010).

PqsA expression was found to be signiﬁcantly reduced by MH or
LH, while cell growth was unaffected by up to 6% honey. Figure 1B
shows ﬂuorescence over time – pqsA is expressed in the exponen-
tial stage of growth, and the graph shows a peak during this growth
phase followed by a decline as the cells exit exponential growth.
In addition to drastically reducing the height of this peak in the
presence of honey, there was also a slight lag period likely caused

by the bacteria adjusting to a new medium. A solution of 4% MH
reduced pqsA gene expression by 50%, while not affecting ﬁnal cell
density.

The pqsA gene expression was also measured for different hon-
eys at a ﬁxed concentration of 4%, the highest concentration of
honey that did not signiﬁcantly impact ﬁnal cell density. Figure 1C
shows ﬂuorescence data for MH and LH, with and without heat
treatment. No signiﬁcant difference was observed between the two
varieties of honey or between raw and heat-treated honey. A con-
centration of 4% of any honey sample had a similar impact on
pqsA expression.

Honey’s impact on the las and rhl gene expression was quan-
tiﬁed by using the β-galactosidase reporter. Figure 1D shows a
signiﬁcant inhibition of both homoserine lactone synthase genes
lasI and rhlI at two bacterial cell densities by 4% honey, especially

prominent at OD600 nm = 2.0.

quinolone signal (PQS), as well as other more abundant

MvfR-regulated low molecular weight molecules, 4-hydroxy-
2-heptylquinoline N -oxide (HQNO), 2,4-dihydroxyquinoline
(DHQ), anthranilic acid (AA), and 2-aminoacetophenone (2-AA)
were assessed by LC–MS from PA14 cells grown in the presence
of honey. Figures 1E,F shows that increasing concentrations of
honey led to an incremental reduction of the signal molecule
levels, with a maximum reduction of approximately 50%. Most
prominent reduction was observed with DHQ, HQNO, and PQS.
Reduced levels of signal molecules and an accumulation of AA, a
precursor molecule in the synthesis of HHQ, DHQ, HQNO, and
2-AA, are the most direct evidence of an impact on the MvfR reg-
ulon, as they are necessary for the feedback loop between MvfR
and the genes it regulates. Reduction of DHQ, an abundant inter-
mediate of HAQs further corroborates honey’s impact on MvfR
regulon. Similarly, reduction of PQS and HQNO levels also sug-
gests an impact on the LasR, system since HHQ is converted
into PQS via the control of LasR, as is the last step of HQNO
synthesis.

Observed inhibition of genes and signal molecules combined
with impacts on downstream virulence factors in the pqs, las, and
rhl operons shows a wide-reaching effect on QS networks.

HONEY IMPACTS QS-REGULATED VIRULENCE FACTORS
Given honey’s impact on QS genes, our next step was to investigate
its effect on virulence factors regulated by QS. In order to study
this we examined virulence factors downstream to key QS genes
in both the AHL and HAQ signal networks.

Pyocyanin is a toxic blue-green compound exclusive to P.
aeruginosa, and is frequently measured as an index of the MvfR
QS network that regulates it (Rahme et al., 1997; Déziel et al.,
2005; Hazan et al., 2010). Figure 2A shows pyocyanin read-
ings for P. aeruginosa grown in LB broth with 4% honey, and
control with no honey. Pyocyanin production was reduced to
50% of the control by both MH and LH. Moreover, Figure 2A
also shows that heat-treated honey equally inhibits pyocyanin
production despite lacking bactericidal properties. Inhibition of
pyocyanin was also observed in minimal medium (M9; data not
shown).

In addition, we found that honey also inhibits production of
extracellular proteases, which are known to be under the control
of MvfR and the las operon – part of the AHL network (Déziel
et al., 2004). When P. aeruginosa was grown on skim milk plates,
the addition of honey to the plates almost completely eliminated
the clear halo around colonies caused by breakdown of casein.
Control plates exhibited a 7-mm halo, while colonies on honey
plates only created a 2-mm halo (Figure 2B).

Impact on two separate QS-regulated virulence factors suggests
that honey affects the expression of the genes that regulate them.
This would indicate an underlying interaction between honey and
the QS networks of P. aeruginosa.

QUORUM SENSING INHIBITION BY HONEY IS ASSOCIATED WITH
SUGAR CONTENT
Our results have shown that the components of honey responsi-
ble for QS inhibition are likely: (a) present in all types of honey
regardless of nectar source, and (b) unaffected by heat treat-
ment. The most obvious candidate is sugar, which is the largest

honey decreases the production of pyocyanin, a virulence factor regulated
by the MvfR QS network of P. aeruginosa. Pyocyanin is displayed as a
percentage normalized to the control (no honey added). (B) demonstrates
the effect on extracellular protease production by honey. Milk plates were

component in all types of honey. To examine the role of honey’s
sugar component, we substituted sugar solutions for honey in tests
of QS-related behaviors.

A pqsA/GFP assay carried out with sugar solutions in LB broth
recreated honey’s inhibitory effect almost exactly. As honey is
roughly 80% sugar, the solutions used were compared to equiv-
alent honey dilutions. Figure 3A shows that sugar solutions
decreased pqsA gene expression and that glucose was the most
potent of the ones tested. A concentration of only 1% glucose
decreased pqsA gene expression by about 50% similarly to MH or
LH (Figure 3A).

Figure 3B shows that 2.5% glucose added to a milk plate inhib-
ited production of extracellular proteases in a similar manner to
4% MH, again almost eliminating the clear halo around PA14
cells. Additionally, in a pyocyanin assay in M9 minimal medium
the addition of 1% glucose inhibited pyocyanin almost completely
with no effect on growth (data not shown). The low concentration

Honey impacts quorum sensing

Firstly, honey causes a signiﬁcant reduction in expression of
both P. aeruginosa QS pathways. Inhibition of pqsA reveals an
impact on the synthesis of the HAQ signaling molecules, PQS and
HHQ, which are required for the activity of MvfR and full expres-
sion of the MvfR-regulated virulence factors such as pyocyanin – a
ﬁnding further reinforced by the accumulation of AA observed,
as it is used as a precursor in the synthesis of these molecules
(Figure 1E). lasI and rhlI, however, are part of the lasR and rhlR
systems that make up the homoserine lactone network (Hazan
et al., 2010). The rhlR system is linked to MvfR, in addition to
regulating another array of virulence factors such as protease pro-
duction, motility, and bioﬁlm formation (Caiazza et al., 2007;
Patriquin et al., 2008). However, the connection between the LasR
and MvfR systems, in reference to honey, means that further
research is needed to determine whether honey’s inhibition of
the MvfR regulon is a direct impact or a secondary effect through
the LasR system.

More directly, honey’s negative impact on virulence factors
regulated by these networks serves to conﬁrm our hypothesis.
Reduced production of pyocyanin is consistent with the observed
inhibition of the hydroxyquinoline-based MvfR system, which
controls its production. Honey also inhibited expression of extra-
cellular proteases, which are regulated by the las operon (Déziel
et al., 2004). This operon is known to be regulated both by MvfR
and by lasR QS systems. Honey’s impact on bacterial behaviors
associated with QS combined with its inhibition of key genes
in both known signaling networks strongly suggests that it has
a wide-reaching effect on QS and associated virulence factors.

Comparisons between the nature of honey’s bactericidal com-
ponents and those inhibiting QS show that there are two separate
mechanisms at work. Previous studies show that bactericidal activ-
ity is likely caused by enzymes or proteins. Our results show that
honey’s previously unknown ability to inhibit QS is at least par-
tially caused by honey’s sugar content. Impacts on pqsA, pyocyanin,
and extracellular proteases were all reproducible by comparable
glucose or fructose solutions. Sugar content, mainly glucose and
fructose, is constant regardless of nectar source because honey-
bees judge the ripeness of honey by sugar concentration. It is
not destroyed by heat, which matches the characteristics of the
component inhibiting QS.

The above results provide valuable insights on the medicinal
use of honey. Consistent with previous studies, the nectar source
is important to honey’s bactericidal properties, with MH gener-
ally acknowledged as one of the most active. In addition to being
a potent treatment in its own right, honey’s ability to disrupt
QS explains the synergistic effect seen when honey is combined
with antibiotics, as interfering with cell-to-cell communication
prevents bacteria from acting as a multicellular entity and makes
them more susceptible to attack. QS-related behaviors are one of
the most dangerous aspects of a bacterial infection – QS is key
in activating multiple virulence factors, forming highly resilient
bioﬁlms and even encouraging the formation of antibiotic tolerant
cells. Therefore, inhibiting QS provides a new and little-explored
tactic against bacteria: the ability to weaken an infection and dis-
rupt virulence, potentially without exerting selection pressure for
resistance.

FIGURE 3 | The effects of honey on QS-related genes and virulence
factors can be reproduced by comparable sugar solutions. (A) Indicates
that the inhibitory effect of diluted honey on pqsA can be reproduced using
sugar solutions. (B) Shows the effect on extracellular proteases caused by

of glucose and the simple nature of the medium rule out osmotic
stress or related effects as a possible cause.

The ability to replicate the impact caused by honey in multiple
tests, both on gene expression and on QS-related virulence factors,
supports the hypothesis that sugar is in active component in QS
inhibition.

DISCUSSION
This study characterizes honey’s interactions with the QS sys-
tems of P. aeruginosa, using sub-inhibitory concentrations (6%
honey and below) to systematically examine the impact of honey
on living bacterial cells. Our novel approach differs signiﬁcantly
from the use of high concentrations of honey to study bactericidal

Honey impacts quorum sensing

The lingering question is the exact mechanism of QS inhibi-
tion by honey’s sugar content. The concentrations of sugar used
did not inhibit bacterial growth at all, indicating that the effect is
not related to osmotic stress. As QS controls responses to envi-
ronmental stimuli such as nutrition, one possible explanation is
that the increased sugar causes a change in the metabolic path-
ways used by the bacteria in such a way that QS genes are not
activated or are inhibited. It is possible that the presence of an easy
food source in the form of sugar leads to less stress on the cells
and a corresponding lack of aggression. This might also explain
the difference in effect between the two sugars added – perhaps
different genes are being activated to metabolize each. Additional
experiments are needed to determine whether the effect is limited
to simple sugars like glucose and fructose or whether other sugars
or compounds could produce similar results. Future studies will

be needed to address: (1) how sugar impacts QS-related behavior;
and (2) whether there are other elements in honey that catalyze or
enhance sugar’s effect.

In summary, honey’s ability to counter bacterial infections
arises from two main factors: bactericidal compounds and QS inhi-
bition. As honey is a highly complex substance there may be further
contributing factors or interdependent components, necessitating
further research, including possible metabolic changes that may
occur as a result of sugars utilization. In the meantime it stands
out as a promising rediscovered treatment whose strength lies in
its ability to counter bacterial virulence on multiple levels. Honey
itself may prove to be one new weapon in the battle against antibi-
otic resistance, but understanding and replicating its attack on
bacteria by multiple mechanisms could be the key to an entirely
new strategy to counter infections.
