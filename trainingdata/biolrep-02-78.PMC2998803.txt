Abstract
The crucial role of the myofibroblast in wound healing and fibrosis development is well established.
This review discusses the mechanisms of myofibroblast action and the new findings that may develop
into therapeutic strategies during the next few years.

Introduction and context
Tissue destruction by organ fibrosis contributes to the
lethal outcomes associated with heart, lung, liver, kidney,
and skin diseases. The cell responsible for the detrimental
fibrotic tissue contractures is the myofibroblast, which has
a phenotype characterized by excessive production of
collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) and tensile force
[1]. The concept that the myofibroblast plays a pivotal role
in the establishment of fibrotic conditions has paved the
way for a new approach in the understanding of the
mechanisms of these pathologic situations [2]. In parti-
cular,
it has become accepted that mechanical force
generation by myofibroblasts, which in turn depends on
the neo-expression of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) in
stress fibers of these cells, regulates essential phenomena
for tissue remodeling, such as cytokine synthesis and ECM
component production [2]. The myofibroblast participates
in a variety of phenomena, including embryologic devel-
opment, organ fibrosis, and the stroma reaction to
epithelial tumors [1]. This widespread occurrence suggests
that the term myofibroblast describes a functional status
rather than a fixed cell type. This assumption has been
supported by recent findings indicating that myofibro-
blasts originate from a spectrum of cellular sources
depending on the physiological or pathological situation
[1]. Myofibroblast origin and its tissue environment should
be considered when planning new therapeutic strategies
that aim at decreasing myofibroblast number or activity.

Major recent advances
The list of cells from which myofibroblasts can derive has
grown impressively during the last years. It includes local
fibroblasts, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth
muscle cells, pericytes, hepatic perisinusoidal cells,
mesenchymal stem cells, and bone marrow-derived
cells known as fibrocytes [1,3]. Most attention has been
given to the fibrocyte as a possible myofibroblast
precursor [4] and the phenomena of epithelial- and
endothelial-mesenchymal transition as myofibroblast
sources, particularly during lung and kidney fibrosis
[5,6]. Transition of epithelial cells all the way to the
myofibroblast phenotype is inducible in culture and
regulated by different signaling pathways [7,8]. However,
the relative contribution of myofibroblast precursors
remains to be determined. As one would intuitively
expect, it appears likely that in most situations local
fibroblasts represent the major source of myofibroblasts
[1]. The local derivation of myofibroblasts from
mesenchymal rather than epithelial or endothelial cells
has recently been documented in a model of renal
interstitial fibrosis by means of genetic lineage tracing [9].

At present there is no accepted therapy for fibrotic diseases
[10]. A number of previous and recent antifibrotic
strategies attempt to interfere with myofibroblast forma-
tion by targeting key factors in the differentiation process
(Figure 1). It is well established that myofibroblast

differentiation and organ fibrosis are predominantly
controlled by transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1)
[11] and the ED-A (extra domain A) found in cellular
fibronectin [12]. Moreover, several cytokines and chemo-
kines (and their receptors), as well as coagulation factors
and ECM components, have been implicated in this
process [13-18]. It is likely that the heterogeneity of the
myofibroblast origin requires specific factors and specific
mechanical conditions in each situation.

Fibrosis is usually diagnosed when tissue destruction is
already progressing, and it is possible that therapies will
have to target the resident myofibroblast population. For
this, aiming at the contractile apparatus is allegedly the
most straight forward and promising strategy to inhibit
myofibroblast function (Figure 1). A new direction,
which has proven experimentally successful, is based on
the observation that intracellular delivery of the a-SMA
amino-terminal
the

sequence Ac-EEED inhibits

incorporation of this protein in myofibroblast stress
fibers, thus reducing force production as well as collagen
type I synthesis by myofibroblasts in vitro; moreover, it
significantly inhibits experimental wound contraction
in vivo [19]. Due to its relative specificity for a-SMA-
expressing myofibroblast stress fibers,
this peptide
appears as a good candidate for topical (e.g., burn
scars) and systemic (e.g., organ fibrosis) administration.

Another promising strategy to induce myofibroblast
disappearance is to stimulate them to go into apoptosis.
Two major intracellular pathways have been identified that
act pro-survival (or anti-apoptotic) for the myofibroblast:
focal adhesion kinase signaling in cell ECM adhesions and
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling. Focal
adhesion kinase activation protects myofibroblasts from
going into apoptosis in response to the loss of cell
adhesion, a phenomenon called anoikis [20]. TGF-b1
and endothelin-1 have been shown to independently

Potential antifibrotic therapies can interfere with the chemical and mechanical factors that lead to myofibroblast formation from different precursor cells

activate the PI3K-AKT pathway and thereby render
myofibroblasts apoptosis-resistant [21]. Development of
protein kinase inhibitors as specific inducers of myofibro-
blast apoptosis is an exciting new avenue in fighting
fibrosis [22]. Other strategies could include myofibroblast-
specific delivery of apoptosis-inducing drugs as applied in
a mouse model of liver fibrosis [23].

least

Inducing myofibroblast disappearance does not neces-
sarily include their killing; interrupting the auto/para-
crine production of active TGF-b1 leads to myofibroblast
in vitro [24]. However,
de-differentiation, at
attempts to use general inhibitors of TGF-b1 have been
relatively unsuccessful, showing that fibrosis develop-
ment is a more complex phenomenon than expected
[25-28]. The limitation of such global strategies is the
interference of the beneficial effects of the pleiotrophic
TGF-b1, such as controlling homeostasis of epithelial,
vascular, endothelial, and immune cells. Therefore, more
promising strategies may be to prevent latent TGF-b1
activation in a cell-type-specific manner rather than
blocking already active TGF-b1. TGF-b1 is secreted
together with LAP (latency-associated peptide), forming
a large complex with latent TGF-b1 binding protein 1
(LTBP-1) in the ECM [29]. Epithelial cells activate latent
TGF-b1 via integrin avb6 [30,31], which requires ECM
binding mediated by LTBP-1 [29]. Inhibition of the
epithelium-specific avb6 integrin protects from lung,
kidney, and bile duct
fibrosis [32-35]. In addition,
integrins avb3, avb8, and avb5 play a role in latent
TGF-b1 activation by fibroblastic cells, either directly or
in a process involving proteases [11,36-40]. We have
described a novel mechanical mechanism of latent TGF-
b1 activation for myofibroblasts that, literally, pulls on
the large latent complex using the integrin avb5 [41].

Future directions
Blocking specific integrins is a promising future
strategy to control the development of myofibroblasts
in fibrotic disorders (Figure 1). In addition to blocking
the latent TGF-b1-activating integrin avb5 [41-44],
[46] avb3
inhibition of
[44,47], and b1 [48] were shown to block myofibro-
blast development and may be developed into future
therapies. The latter integrins are all
implicated in
myofibroblast mechanoperception and transduction. It
becomes increasingly clear that myofibroblast differ-
entiation crucially depends on mechanical factors such
as ECM stiffness and intracellular tension. Mechanical
stress determines the stress fiber localization of a-SMA
[49], modulates a-SMA promoter activity and protein
expression in a process that involves the myocardin-
related transcription factor [7,48,50], and modulates
the bioactivity of TGF-b1 [41]. Hence,
releasing

myofibroblasts from stress – for example, using the
Ac-EEED peptide [51] – will have a profound and long-
term effect on myofibroblast persistence and may even
induce myofibroblast apoptosis [52].
