The major defining pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are the accumulations of Aβ in senile plaques and 
hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. Recent studies indicate that rather than these insoluble 
lesions, the soluble Aβ oligomers and hyperphosphorylated tau are the toxic agents of AD pathology. Such pathological protein 
species are accompanied by cytoskeletal changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, Ca2+ dysregulation, and oxidative stress. In this 
review, we discuss how the binding of Aβ to various integrins, defects in downstream focal adhesion signaling, and activation of 
cofilin can impact mitochondrial dysfunction, cytoskeletal changes, and tau pathology induced by Aβ oligomers. Such pathological 
consequences can also feedback to further activate cofilin to promote cofilin pathology. We also suggest that the mechanism of Aβ 
generation by the endocytosis of APP is mechanistically linked with perturbations in integrin-based focal adhesion signaling, as 
APP, LRP, and β-integrins are physically associated with each other.

ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE DEFINITION AND PREVALENCE

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related 
neurodegenerative condition, accounting for up to 70% of all 
cases of dementia. Prevalence rates of AD range from ~10% of 
individuals >65 and up to 50% of individuals greater than 85 years 
of age. Early stages of AD are presented by short-term memory 
deficits, which steadily decline with worsening dementia clinically 
manifested by long-term memory loss, language disturbances,

changes in personality, attention deficits, hallucinations, and 
reasoning impairments. The clinical course ranges usually from 5 
to 15 years. 

PATHOLOGICAL HALLMARKS OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE

The major defining pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) are the accumulations of amyloid β (Aβ) and 
hyperphosphorylated tau in senile plaques and neurofibrillary 
tangles, respectively. Aβ is a neurotoxic peptide derived from 
β- and γ-secretase cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein 
(APP). The vast majority of APP is constitutively cleaved in the 
middle of the Aβ sequence by α-secretase (ADAM10/TACE/
ADAM17) in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, thereby abrogating

the generation of an intact Aβ peptide. Alternatively, a small 
proportion of APP is cleaved in the amyloidogenic pathway, 
leading to the secretion of Aβ peptides (37 to 42 amino acids) via 
two proteolytic enzymes, β- and γ-secretase, known as BACE1 
and presenilin, respectively (De Strooper and Annaert, 2000). The 
proteolytic processing of APP to generate Aβ requires endocytosis 
from the cell surface and localization to cholesterol-rich 
membrane rafts where both BACE1 and the presenilin complex 
are enriched (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Perez et al., 1999; Wahrle et 
al., 2002). 
Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads are intracellular 
inclusions principally composed of the microtubule associated 
protein tau in hyperphosphorylated form. Hyperphosphorylated 
tau assembles into twisted filaments ultrastructurally seen as 
paired helical filaments or PHFs, which are immunopositive 
with AD-specific diagnostic antibodies, such as AT100 or 
AT8 (Avila et al., 2004). Tau proteins normally function to 
stabilize microtubules and are usually seen in somatoaxonal 
compartments. However during early stages of AD pathogenesis, 
tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, which weakens its association 
with microtubules, and is frequently detected in somatodendritic 
compartments. Thus, hyperphosphorylated tau is unable to 
stabilize microtubules, mislocalizes to dendritic compartments, 
and becomes more prone to self-assembly into PHFs (Gendron 
and Petrucelli, 2009). 

GENETICS OF ALZHEIMER’ DISEASE AND THE AMYLOID 
HYPOTHESIS

Twenty years ago in 1991, the amyloid hypothesis was postulated 
that the Aβ deposits are fundamental causes of AD rather than 
simply pathological hallmarks of the disease (Hardy and Allsop, 
1991). This hypothesis was initially supported by the identification 
of mutations in APP that co-segregated with early onset familial 
AD (FAD). Importantly, all of the FAD mutations identified thus 
far are concentrated near the β-secretase or γ-secretase cleavage 
sites in APP such that either total Aβ or the more pathogenic 
Aβ42 peptide is elevated. While γ-secretase cleavage of APP at 
Aβ residue 42 (Aβ42) is a minor species (~10%) compared to 
Aβ40 (>80%), numerous studies have shown that Aβ42 is more 
neurotoxic and is required to efficiently seed the aggregation 
of Aβ40 (Glabe, 2008). Furthermore, individuals with trisomy 
21 (Down’s syndrome) with an extra copy of the APP gene on 
chromosome 21 invariably exhibit AD pathology by the 4th decade 
of life. Closer examination of Down’s syndrome brains showed 
that Aβ42 containing senile plaques develop much earlier than 
neurofibrillary tangles, further supporting the amyloid hypothesis 

(Hyman, 1992; Hyman et al., 1995). In 1995, mutations in two 
homologous genes, Presenilin 1 (PS1) and Presenilin 2 (PS2) were 
discovered that co-segregated with the most aggressive forms of 
autosomal dominant early-onset FAD. Thus far, more than 100 
different independent FAD mutations in PS1 and PS2 have been 
identified (St George-Hyslop and Petit, 2005). Further adding 
support to the amyloid hypothesis, all of the presenilin mutations 
studied were found to increase the more pathogenic and faster 
aggregating Aβ42 peptide. Although mutations in APP, PS1, 
and PS2 account for the majority of early-onset familial AD, the 
vast majority (>95%) of AD is the late-onset sporadic form that 
cannot be explained by a single gene defect. Nevertheless, genetic 
risk factors play an important modulatory role in the onset and 
severity of AD pathogenesis. The best known and strongest genetic 
risk factor identified to date is the ε4 allele of the gene coding for 
Apolipoprotein E (APOE). The APOE ε4 allele increases the risk 
for AD by ~3-fold among hemizygotes and by ~15-fold among 
homozygotes (Holtzman, 2001). Further supporting the amyloid 
hypothesis, apoE4 promotes the aggregation of Aβ far more 
efficiently than apoE3, the most common nonpathogenic variant 
(Strittmatter et al., 1993). Therefore, all known and confirmed 
genetic component of AD either increase total Aβ, the more 
pathogenic Aβ42 peptide, or aggregation states of Aβ.

SOLUBLE Aβ OLIGOMER HYPOTHESIS AND TAU PATHOLOGY

Recent biochemical and cellular studies on Aβ-induced neuro-
toxi city have uncovered that distinct states or species of Aβ 
have different biological properties. First, Aβ42, while at much 
lower concentration than Aβ40, aggregates faster and seeds the 
aggregation of Aβ40 (Glabe, 2008). Transgenic mice engineered 
to produce only Aβ40 or Aβ42 cleaved from the familial British 
and Danish Dementia-related BRI protein demonstrates that 
pro duc tion of Aβ40 cannot form aggregates into plaques even by 
18 months of age, while a lesser concentration of Aβ42 induces 
ro bust plaque formation even at 12 months of age. Furthermore, 
the BRI-Aβ42 mice crossed with APP Tg2576 mice bearing the 
“Swedish” mutation exponentially exacerbates amyloid plaque for-
ma tion (McGowan et al., 2005). Second, Aβ can exist as soluble 
monomers, dimers, trimers, and higher order oligomers (also 
kno wn as Aβ-derived diffusible ligands; ADDLs) prior to forming 
protofibrils and insoluble amyloid fibrils. These pathological so-
lu ble Aβ oligomers cause synaptic dysfunction to neurons even at 
picomolar concentrations. Studies have shown that SDS-stable 
di mers and trimers derived from the 7PA2 cell line ex pre s s ing 
an FAD APP mutation impair long term potentiation (LTP), 
the physiological correlate of learning and memory, at sub na-

no mo lar concentrations (Walsh et al., 2002). Furthermore, so-
lu ble SDS-resistant Aβ dimers derived from AD brains lead to 
hy perphosphorylation of tau and neuritic degeneration in pri-
mary hippocampal neurons at picomolar concentrations (Jin et 
al., 2011). Recently, a new mutation in APP was identified in a 
Japanese family with AD-type dementia. This mutation occurred 
as a deletion of residue 22 (glutamic acid) of the Aβ peptide 
(E22Δ). Biochemically, the E22Δ mutation is more resistant to 
de gradation, unable to form fibrils, but far more prone to self-
asso ciation as Aβ oligomers in the form of SDS-stable dimers and 
trimers (Tomiyama et al., 2008). Expression of this APP muta-
tion in transgenic mice leads to learning and memory deficits 
associated with impaired LTP, enhanced neuroinflammation, 
and tau hyperphosphorylation in the absence of any thioflavin S 
positive amyloid plaques. However, accumulation of intracellular 
E22Δ Aβ oligomers are detected in an age-dependent fashion, 
in di cating that Aβ oligomers are sufficient and fibrillar amyloid 
de position is not necessary for Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and 
lear ning and memory deficits (Nishitsuji et al., 2009). Indeed, a 
recent study showed that highly compacted amyloid plaques may 
actually be protective. Loss of one copy of IGF-1 receptor, which 
lengthens lifespan, was shown to be protective by promoting faster 
aggregation of Aβ and increasing the density of amyloid plaques, 
thereby sequestering toxic soluble Aβ oligomer species into amy-
loid fibrils (Cohen et al., 2009). While it appears that amyloid fi b rils 
per se might be less neurotoxic than soluble Aβ oligomers, it is im-
portant to note that amyloid fibrils can disaggregate into so lu ble 
Aβ oligomers, and thus, may serve as stable sources of these neu-
ro toxic species.
Numerous studies have shown that Aβ promotes the hyperphos-
phorylation of tau in vitro and in vivo (Avila et al., 2004; Gendron 
and Petrucelli, 2009). Furthermore, Aβ also increases the number 
of neurofibrillary tangles in transgenic mice engineered to exp ress 
a Frontotemporal Dementia (FTDP-17) tau mutation (Lewis et 
al., 2001). Moreover, depletion of Aβ by injection of an anti body 
directed against Aβ also leads to reduced tau pa tho logy in the APP/
tau/presenilin-1 mutant triple transgenic mice (Oddo et al., 2004), 
further supporting the model that Aβ pro motes tau pathology in 
vivo. In addition, recent studies have demon strated that many of 
the toxic effects of Aβ require tau ex p ression, indicating that tau 
is indeed downstream of Aβ-in du ced neurotoxic signals. Neurite 
retraction and progressive neuronal atrophy are seen when neu rons 
are treated with Aβ but not in neurons derived from tau knockout 
mice (Rapoport et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2011). Furthermore, learn ing 
and memory impairment as well as high sensitivity to exci to toxin 
treatment are present in mutant APP transgenic mice but not in the 
same transgenic mice on a tau homozygous knock  out background, 

even though the level of Aβ deposition is unaffected by tau (Rober-
son et al., 2007). Importantly, Aβ induces impairments in LTP and 
axonal transport of mitochondria; how ever, such impairments 
are not seen in tau knockout neurons (Shipton et al., 2011; Vossel 
et al., 2011), indicating that tau is re qui red for multiple facets of Aβ- 
induced neurotoxicity. These re sults all indicate that Aβ-in du ced 
toxic signals are transmitted via tau. But what might be a me cha-
ni sm of tau in Aβ/ tau-mediated neurotoxicity? A recent study 
de monstrated that Aβ oligomers ra pidly lead to disassembly of 
microtubules but only in cells exp ressing tau (King et al., 2006). 
This is particularly important in brain, because tau is highly ex-
pre s sed in neurons. Furthermore, the microtubule network is 
critical for such processes as axonal transport and ultimately sy-
naptic trans mission. One of the earliest changes in tau pathology 
seen in AD is the mislocalization of tau from somatoaxonal to 
so ma to den dritic compartments (Avila et al., 2004; Gendron and 
Petrucelli, 2009). An important study recently demonstrated that 
hyperphosphorylation of tau is linked to reduced affinity for 
micro tubules and mislocalization into den dritic spines where tau 
induces removal of various AMPA and NMDA receptors critical 
for excitatory synaptic transmission. Loss of tau phosphorylation 
fails to mislocalize tau into dendritic spines and affect excitatory 
synaptic transmission (Hoover et al., 2010). Therefore, Aβ-induced 
hyperphosphorylation of tau appears to explain both microtubule 
disassembly and impaired excitatory synaptic transmission. It is 
im portant to note that, like soluble Aβ oligomers, soluble hyper-
phos phorylated tau rather than PHF tau may be the toxic species, 
since turning off FTD mu tant tau expression in an inducible trans-
genic model does not remove insoluble PHF-1 positive tangle-like 
structures over several months but improves learning and memory 
(Santacruz et al., 2005).

MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION IN AD: Aβ, CA2+ 
DYSREGULATION AND ROS ACCUMULATION

As the human brain utilizes 20% of total body oxygen consump-
tion, mitochondria, the cellular energy plant, is of great im por tan ce 
when it comes the mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Mi to chon-
d ria serve as important reservoirs of Ca2+ and apoptotic pro te ins 
and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), all of which have im-
por tant implications in AD pathogenesis. The role of Ca2+ sig na-
ling is essential for neuronal survival and function in that they 
use Ca2+ in generating membrane excitability, relea sing neu ro-
trans mi tters, activity-dependent gene expression, neu ro nal growth 
and differentiation, and triggering apoptosis (Bez prozvanny and 
Mattson, 2008). Intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is tightly main-
tained by the interplay among various Ca2+ channels and pro-

teins within different cellular compartments, including the Ca2+ 
uni porter (MCU) in mitochondria (Bezprozvanny, 2009). As 
Ca2+ homeostasis is regulated through multiple mechanisms, the 
implications of its regulation to the development of AD are also 
varied.
Mitochondria play essential roles in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis 
and ROS generation, both of which are pathologically linked 
to neurotoxicity. When Ca2+ levels increase in the cytosol, 
mitochondria potently take up Ca2+ through the mitochondrial 
Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), resulting in Ca2+ buffering and increased 
metabolism and production of ATP (Bezprozvanny and Mattson, 
2008). However if excess amounts of Ca2+ enter the mitochondria 
(calcium overload), it leads to decreased mitochondrial membrane 
potential (MMP) and oxidative stress. This, in turn, results in 
formation of the mitochondrial permeability-transition pore 
(mtPTP) and failure to exert Ca2+ buffering capacity, leading 
to secondary excitotoxicity (Hengartner, 2000). ROS are also 
produced as a result of the opening of the mtPTP, as antioxidants 
such a glutathione can exit the mitochondria, resulting in the 
failure to neutralize ROS. Moreover, loss of components of the 
electron transport chain (ETC) such as cytochrome c and others 
may occur through the mtPTP, resulting in activation of caspases 
3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and increased ROS production (Li et al., 1997; 
Bossy-Wetzel et al., 1998; Granville et al., 1998). ROS, at low to 
moderate concentrations, is an important mediator of defense 
mechanisms against infectious agents, various cellular signaling 
events, and synaptic function. However, if the ROS production 
exceeds the amount that can be neutralized by anti-oxidant 
mechanisms, it eventually results in mitochondrial dysfunction 
and neuronal damage (Andreyev et al., 2005), the molecular 
targets of which are DNA, lipids, and protein machineries 
within the cell and mitochondria (Knight, 1997). Interestingly, 
increasing mitochondrial oxidative stress induced by deficiency 
of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 leads to high levels of 
Ser-396 phosphorylated tau (Melov et al., 2007), indicating that 
mitochondrial oxidative damage also impacts tau pathology.
The role of mitochondrial ROS as inducers of Ca2+ dysregulation 
is well-established. On the other hand, a major cause of ROS 
production is also Ca2+ dysregulation. Thus, oxidative stress 
and Ca2+ regulation are intricately linked and can cooperatively 
contribute to AD pathogenesis. It has been shown that Aβ 
oligomers can form Ca2+-permeable channels in the plasma 
membranes (Arispe et al., 1993) and that the association 
of Aβ to membranes is enhanced in the presence of excess 
phosphatidylserine (PtdS) (Lee et al., 2002a). Multiple studies have 
demonstrated that Aβ can dysregulate Ca2+ homeostasis via several 
Ca2+ signaling components (Bezprozvanny, 2009): calcineurin 

(Kuchibhotla et al., 2008), NMDARs (De Felice et al., 2007), 
AMPARs (Hsieh et al., 2006), and P/Q-type VGCCs (Nimmrich et 
al., 2008). Furthermore, FAD mutations in presenilins (PS), which 
potentiate Aβ42 generation, induce excessive Ca2+ release from 
the ER through IP3 and ryanodine receptors (Cheung et al., 2008; 
Rybalchenko et al., 2008). In AD brains, intracellular Ca2+ levels are 
positively correlated with neurofibrillary tangle formation (McKee 
et al., 1990; Nixon, 2003). As such, it is clear that dysregulation of 
Ca2+ dynamics is an important component of AD pathogenesis. 
It has been shown that Aβ decreases mitochondrial membrane 
potential and increases respiration uncoupling and mitochondrial 
ROS (Moreira et al., 2001) along with the inhibition of complexes 
I, III, and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Pereira et 
al., 1998). Other studies have demonstrated that Aβ treatment 
promotes caspase 3, 8, and 9 activation (Fossati et al., 2010; Wang 
et al., 2010). Furthermore, Aβ induces abnormal mitochondrial 
dynamics. Specifically, Aβ (25-35) peptide impairs axonal 
transport of mitochondria, attenuates mitochondrial motility, and 
alters mitochondrial distribution in mouse hippocampal neurons, 
resulting in synaptic degeneration (Calkins and Reddy, 2011). A 
recent study demonstrated early deficits in synaptic mitochondria 
in FAD mutant APP transgenic mice: 1) synaptic mitochondrial 
dysfunction, 2) Aβ accumulation within mitochondria prior to 
extracellular Aβ deposition, and 3) impaired axonal transport 
of mitochondria (Du et al., 2010). Synapses are relatively more 
susceptible to Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, which is not surprising, 
because Aβ is mainly released by and accumulates in synapses 
(Mattson, 2004). Aβ induces Ca2+ dysregulation by membrane-
associated oxidative stress and activates calcineurin, an important 
mediator of synaptic plasticity (Celsi et al., 2007). In addition, Aβ 
induces synaptic dystrophy and dysregulation at least in part due 
to decreased expression of NMDA and EphB2 receptors at the 
synapse, an event that can be corrected by NMDAR agonists (Lacor 
et al., 2007). Though the exact mechanisms of ROS-induced 
synaptic degeneration remain to be further elucidated, ROS is 
well known to play important roles in synaptic plasticity. Indeed, 
oxidation of cysteine residues on RynR increases Ca2+ release 
from the ER (Hidalgo, 2005) and oxidation of the same residues 
on NMDAR decreases the receptor activity (Lipton et al., 2002). 
Therefore, it appears that Aβ induces synaptic deficits via both 
increasing oxidative damage and dysregulating Ca2+ dynamics 
at the synapse and mitochondria, both of which cooperatively 
contribute to neurodegeneration in AD. 
Tau pathology is also linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Trans-
genic mice over-expressing the P301L mutant demonstrate a sig-
ni ficant reduction in complex V and NADH-ubiquinone oxido-
reductase activity together with impairments in mitochondrial

res piration and ATP synthesis (David et al., 2005). Tau can be clea-
ved by caspases 3, 7, and 8 after Asp-421, yielding a 421 residue 
tau fragment that assembles into PHF-like fibrils more rapidly 
than full length tau. Overexpression of this cleaved tau leads to a 
significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and 
loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity (Quintanilla et al., 
2009). Moreover, introduction of tau in mature hippocampal 
neu rons results in degeneration of synapses by perturbing mito-
chondria transport and ATP levels at the synapse (Thies and 
Mandelkow, 2007). N-terminal tau fragments have toxic effects 
on mitochondria and lead to the mitochondrial dysfunction 
asso ci a ted with impairments in oxidative phosphorylation by 
di stor ting the enzyme structure of complex V and the level of 
ade nine nucleotide translocator, which ultimately perturbs ATP 
synthesis in mitochondria (Atlante et al., 2008). Interestingly, 
these N-terminal tau fragments are localized in AD synaptic mito-
chon d ria (Amadoro et al., 2010). Taken together, both Aβ and 
tau exert deleterious effects on mitochondria, events that involve 
ROS generation and Ca2+ dysregulation, which negatively impact 
synaptic function and neuronal viability.

Aβ NEUROTOXIC SIGNALING VIA INTEGRINS AND FOCAL 
ADHESIONS

Aβ oligomers are clearly neurotoxic at least in part by trans-
mitting neurotoxic signals to tau. Furthermore, both Aβ and 
tau exert deleterious effects on mitochondria, resulting in ROS 
accu mulation and Ca2+ dysregulation, which ultimately com pro-
mi ses synaptic function and neuronal viability. But what types of 
neuronal surface receptors and intracellular signals are needed 
to transmit these Aβ-induced neurotoxic messages to tau and 
mito chondria? It has been reported that Aβ binds to various diffe-
rent neuronal receptors, including but not limited to NMDA, 
ni co tinic (α7nAChR), and p75NTR receptors. Aβ binding to 
NMDA receptors has been reported to increase calcium influx 
and potentiate NMDAR activation, but other conflicting reports 
have shown that Aβ oligomers depress LTP and cause progressive 
loss of dendritic spines associated with reduced excitatory synaptic 
transmission and removal of glutamate receptors from spines (Hsieh 
et al., 2006; Pena et al., 2006; Shankar et al., 2007). A recent study 
also showed that Aβ oligomers stimulate extrasynaptic NMDA 
(NR2B) receptor responses to inhibit LTP and activate LTD (Li 
et al., 2011). Conflicting reports have also shown that Aβ can act 
as both agonist and antagonist of α7nAChR (Dineley et al., 2001; 
Pettit et al., 2001). The binding of Aβ to p75NTR, especially in 
cho linergic neurons of the basal forebrain where this receptor is 
enriched, is associated with death of these neurons. In p75NTR 

knockout mice, such Aβ-induced degeneration of the basal fore-
brain is not observed (Yaar et al., 1997). Therefore, targeting the 
Aβ/p75NTR interaction appears to represent a promising the ra-
peutic strategy, especially for the cholinergic system. However in 
this review, we will focus on the integrin adhesion receptors, as Aβ 
mediates its neurotoxicity via binding to multiple integrins, which 
are highly enriched throughout the brain.
The integrin family mediates both cell-cell and cell-substratum 
adhesion by binding their extracellular ligands such as laminin 
and fibronectin. Integrins consist of an α and a β subunit, and each 
subunit has a large extracellular portion, a single transmembrane 
segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Hynes, 1992). These 
cytoplasmic tails bind to intracellular ligands to mediate dynamic 
cellular responses, such as cell adhesion, migration, neurogenesis, 
apoptosis, and synaptic stability. Hence, integrins provide a 
transmembrane link for the bidirectional transmission of signals 
across the plasma membrane by binding both extracellular and 
intracellular ligands (Zamir and Geiger, 2001). The ability to 
connect to the actin cytoskeleton is an important part of the 
adhesive function of the integrin family. Within focal adhesions, 
structural proteins such as vinculin and talin anchor β-integrins 
to the actin cytoskeleton, while signaling proteins such as 
focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Pyk2, Paxillin, and Src mediate 
downstream signaling events in a transient and controlled manner 
(Cabodi et al., 2010). Integrin signaling is also associated with 
changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability. Glutamate 
receptors (NMDA and AMPA receptors) are the target of integrin-
dependent regulation. Interfering with integrin-dependent 
adhesion by antagonists or conditional deletion of α3, α5, and/
or β1 integrins leads to defective LTP (Becchetti et al., 2010). 
Therefore, integrins represent important adhesion receptors that 
can regulate multiple facets of neuronal function and viability.
Multiple studies have shown that Aβ can bind to a number of 
di fferent integrins, a process that can lead to both protective and 
neurotoxic outcomes. α5/β1-integrin has been shown to exert 
an anti-apoptotic role. Adhesion by α5/β1-integrin upregulates 
Bcl-2 and is one of the few integrins that activates the signaling 
protein Shc. Matter and colleagues showed that α5/β1-integrin 
binds to nonfibrillar but not fibrillar Aβ1-40 and reduces the 
for mation of insoluble fibrillar Aβ via internalization of Aβ and 
partial degradation, an effect that is blocked by an antibody 
aga inst α5-integrin. Overexpression of α5/β1-integrin protects 
from Aβ-induced apoptosis (Matter et al., 1998). Bozzo and col-
lea gues demonstrated that plating of retinoic acid differentiated 
SH-SY5Y cells to collagen, fibronectin, or laminin reduces Aβ 
(25-35)-induced toxicity. Preincubation of cells with antibodies 
directed against β1-integrin or α1-integrin substantially enhances

Aβ toxicity when plated on collagen, presumably because disrup-
tion of integrin ligation to collagen enhances the binding of Aβ to 
integrins. Treatment of Aβ (25-35) also induces a strong down-
regulation of β1-integrin on the cell surface while not affec ting β3, 
α3, and α1 integrins (Bozzo et al., 2004). Therefore, in tegrins can 
modulate Aβ levels and by binding, internalization, and de gra da tion 
of Aβ. In addition, the ligation of integrins to their physiological 
sub strates can protect against Aβ-induced neuro toxicity.
On the other hand, multiple studies have shown that several 
integrins are also required for Aβ-induced toxicity. Integrin 
blocking antibodies to α1/β1 or echistatin (a highly selective and 
potent integrin inhibitor) blocks fibrillar Aβ-induced MAPK 
activation and Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in primary neuronal 
cultures (Anderson and Ferreira, 2004). Moreover, antibodies 
against αv-integrins block the inhibition in LTP induced by Aβ. In 
addition, a small molecule nonpeptide antagonist of αv-containing 
integrins (SM256) and a potent disintegrin echistatin also block 
Aβ-induced inhibition of LTP. Accordingly, a potent ligand of αv/
β1 integrin, superfibronectin, also efficiently inhibits Aβ-induced 
inhibition of LTP (Wang et al., 2008). As glutamate receptors are 
targets of integrin-mediated regulation, it is likely that integrin-
mediated alterations in glutamate receptors underlie Aβ-induced 
inhibition of LTP. Addition of soluble Aβ together with fibrillar Aβ 
dramatically enhances the meshwork of Aβ deposition on cortical 
neurons and induces neurotoxicity in an α2/β1 and αv/β1 integrin 
dependent manner (Wright et al., 2007). Antibodies against β1, α2, 
and αv but not α1, α3, α4, α5, α6, α9, αv/β 3, αv/β5, or β3 integrins 
inhibit Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in human primary neurons 
(Wright et al., 2007). Aβ elicits a sustained phosphorylation of 
pyk2-associated paxillin, which correlates with neurotoxicity. 
Expression of a dominant negative Pyk2 abolishes Aβ-induced 
neurotoxicity, and αv/β1 ligands (fibronectin, superfibronectin, 
and vitronectin) as well as α2/β1 ligands (collagen and laminin) all 
block Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, presumably via competing with 
Aβ binding to these receptors (Wright et al., 2007). Interestingly, 
both actin stabilizing compounds (jasplkinolide) and destabilizing 
compounds (cytochalasin D and latrunculin A) also inhibit 
Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, indicating that downstream actin 
remodeling is critical for this effect (Wright et al., 2007). Perlecan 
domain V, which binds to α2-integrin, competitively inhibits Aβ 
binding to cells as well as Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (Wright et 
al., 2010). α2 null cells significantly bind less Aβ than wild type 
cells, and Aβ binds more efficiently to cell expressing the activated 
form of α2-integrin (Wright et al., 2010). All of these findings 
taken together indicate that Aβ binding to various integrins, 
especially α2, β1, and αv, are required for the complement of 
Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. However, the normal engagement of 

integrins to their cognate physiological matrix substrates appears 
to be protective for a couple of reasons. First, the physiological 
substrates compete out the binding of Aβ to integrins, and second, 
they mediate normal and tightly regulated integrin activation and 
downstream signaling. Integrin activation and downstream focal 
adhesion signaling (FAK, Pyk2, Paxillin, and Src) induced by Aβ 
binding to integrins is not well characterized but appears to be a 
prolonged and dysregulated, unlike that seen with physiological 
substrates (Wright et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Cabodi et al., 
2010). It is likely that such aberrant transmission of focal adhesion 
signals and/or the breakdown of focal adhesion complexes 
underlie Aβ-induced neurotoxicity.
An important consideration in the role of integrins and focal 
adhesion signaling in AD pathogenesis is the observation that 
APP together with reelin physically associate with α3/β1 integrin 
(Hoe et al., 2009). Reelin simultaneously promotes neurite 
outgrowth in primary neurons as well as the nonamyloidogenic 
α-secretase processing of APP in an APP and α3/β1 integrin-
dependent manner, thereby inhibiting the generation of Aβ (Hoe 
et al., 2009). The enhanced α-secretase processing of APP and 
reduced Aβ generation by reelin is due to increased level of surface 
APP by blocking APP endocytosis, since α-secretase processing 
of APP primarily takes place on the cell surface and endocytosis is 
required for Aβ generation (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Perez et al., 
1999; Hoe et al., 2009). Furthermore it is well known that the Low 
Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein (LRP) not only 
physically associates with APP but also with β-integrins (Salicioni 
et al., 2004). We have shown that LRP promotes APP endocytosis 
and Aβ generation in lipid raft microdomains (Pietrzik et al., 2002; 
Yoon et al., 2005; Yoon et al., 2007). In addition, LRP is required to 
mediate the trafficking of β-integrins to the cell surface (Salicioni 
et al., 2004). On the extracellular side, Aβ interacts not only with 
integrins but also with APP and LRP (Lu et al., 2003; Deane et 
al., 2009). Indeed the binding of Aβ to APP is dependent on the 
the Aβ domain of full-length APP on the cell surface (Lu et al., 
2003). On the intracellular side, the scaffolding protein RanBP9 
physically associates with APP, LRP, BACE1, and β-integrins (Denti 
et al., 2004; Lakshmana et al., 2009; Lakshmana et al., 2010). Such 
association of RanBP9 promotes APP endocytosis, interaction 
between APP and BACE1, and localization of APP to cholesterol-
rich lipid raft microdomains, leading to increased BACE1 cleavage 
of APP and Aβ generation (Lakshmana et al., 2009; Lakshmana et 
al., 2010). These observations raise the intriguing possibility that 
Aβ-induced neurotoxicity as a ligand for integrins, APP, and LRP 
is mechanistically coupled to the generation of Aβ via endocytosis 
of the integrin/APP/LRP receptor complexes. Such process may 
displace physiological ligands (i.e. fibronectin or reelin), thereby

leading to the aberrant recruitment of intracellular factors (i.e. 
RanBP9) to their cytoplasmic tails to transmit neurotoxic signals 
(i.e. dysregulated focal adhesion signals) while simultaneously 
promoting Aβ generation. This vicious cycle may in part explain 
the progressive nature of neurodegeneration and accumulation of 
Aβ seen in AD.

COFILIN, A CENTRAL NEXUS OF CYTOSKELETAL CHANGES, 
MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION, AND TAU PATHOLOGY IN 
NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES?

Integrins, mitochondrial dysfunction, cytoskeletal perturbations, 

and tau phosphorylation are key elements of Aβ-induced 
neurotoxicity. However, what critical downstream intracellular 
factors relay the Aβ neurotoxic signals to the mitochondria, 
cytoskeleton, and tau? The assembly and disassembly of G-actin 
to F-actin is a process critical to many cellular processes, including 
cell motility, migration, dendritic spine morphogenesis, and 
membrane protein endocytosis (Bernstein and Bamburg, 2010). 
ADF/Cofilin, a family of actin-binding protein, is perhaps one 
of the key regulators of actin dynamics. Cofilin differentially 
modulates actin dynamics depending on the ratio of cofilin 
to actin. At low cofilin to actin ratios, cofilin acts to sever 
actin filaments, whereas at high cofilin to actin ratios, cofilin 

Fig. 1. Schematic of normal (A) and pathological (B) integrin-based focal adhesion signaling. (A) During normal focal adhesion signaling, the binding 
of integrins to their physiological ligands such as extracellular matrix proteins (i.e. fibronectin or laminin) or reelin activates various focal adhesion 
signaling proteins (i.e. paxillin, FAK, Src, and PI3K), leading to the activation of the Rac-PAK pathway. PAK activates LIMK which phosphorylates 
cofilin on serine-3. This phosphorylation inactivates cofilin, thereby transiently reducing actin dynamics. The engagement of normal physiological 
ligands such as reelin with the integrin/APP/LRP complexes (A) simultaneously slows down APP endocytosis, thereby reducing Aβ generation. As the 
binding of Aβ to various integrins is critical to transmit its neurotoxic signals, Aβ oligomers may displace normal integrin ligands, thereby transmitting 
defective or aberrant focal adhesion signals, eventually leading to defects in PAK activation. In appropriate or reduced PAK signaling fails to activate 
LIMK, thereby reducing cofilin phosphorylation. Under conditions of oxidative stress induced by Aβ oligomers or hyperphosphorylated tau, cofilin 
and 14-3-3ζ is oxidized leading to activation of SSH and further activation of cofilin. Oxidized and dephosphorylated cofilin translocates into the 
mitochondria to open up the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, an event that is required for oxidant-induced cell death. Cofilin translocation 
into mitochondria induces mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby further increasing ROS and calcium dysregulation. Calcium dysregulation by Aβ, tau, 
and/or cofilin also activates calcineurin, which then leads to SSH activation and further cofilin activation. Activated cofilin can lead to the formation of 
cofilin-actin rods or aggregates, which attracts hyperphosphorylated tau and promote tau pathology. At the same time, the binding of RanBP9 to APP/
LRP/integrin complexes accelerates APP endocytosis and enhances Aβ generation, thereby further propagating Aβ-induced neurotoxic signaling.

nucleates actin assembly and stabilizes F-actin (Bernstein and 
Bamburg, 2010). The activity of cofilin is largely controlled by 
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on serine-3 of cofilin by 
LIMK and Slingshot-1L (SSH), respectively (Bernard, 2007; Eiseler 
et al., 2009). Phosphorylation of cofilin by LIMK1, a downstream 
component of Rac-PAK signaling upon focal adhesion activation, 
serves to inactivate cofilin, whereas dephosphorylation of cofilin 
by Slingshot-1L (SSH) activates cofilin. It has also been shown 
that reelin, via a pathway involving Dab1, Src, and PI3K, promotes 
the phosphorylation of cofilin on serine-3, thereby inactivating 
cofilin (Chai et al., 2009). Therefore, proper relay of focal adhesion 
signals downstream of integrin and/or reelin activation leads to 
the phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin by LIMK1, Src, 
and potentially other kinases, leading to reduced actin dynamics. 
At the same time, reelin inhibits Aβ generation by blocking APP 
endocytosis, a process that is both APP and integrin-dependent 
(Hoe et al., 2009). However, ligation of Aβ with integrins may lead 
to improper control of focal adhesion assembly/ signaling and 
dysregulation of cofilin at multiple levels and further enhance Aβ 
generation (Fig. 1). 
Cofilin does not only play a key role in regulating actin dynamics 
but also mediates a critical function in oxidative stress-induced 
cell death via an essential mitochondrial mechanism (Chua et al., 
2003; Klamt et al., 2009). Upon oxidative stress, cofilin becomes 
oxidized on several cysteine residues (Klamt et al., 2009). This 
causes cofilin to lose its affinity for actin and to translocate into the 
mitochondria, where it induces swelling, drop in mitochondrial 
membrane potential, and cytochrome c release by promoting the 
opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) (Klamt et al., 
2009). Interestingly, this occurs independently of Bax. In addition 
to cofilin oxidation, dephosphorylation (or activation) of cofilin 
is required for its translocation to the mitochondria and oxidant-
induced apoptosis. When oxidation of cofilin is prevented, oxidant 
induced apoptosis is also inhibited. Furthermore knockdown 
of endogenous cofilin by siRNA also inhibits both oxidant and 
staurosporin induced apoptosis, indicating that cofilin is critical 
for mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (Chua et al., 2003; Klamt et 
al., 2009). Interestingly, inhibition of actin dynamics is associated 
with increased ROS production and reduced mitochondrial 
membrane potential (Gourlay and Ayscough, 2005), both of 
which can further contribute to cofilin-mediated mitochondrial 
dysfunction. Therefore, dysregulation of cofilin itself, which 
leads to inhibition of actin dynamics, can lead to increased ROS 
levels and mitochondrial dysfunction. Cellular stimuli that 
generate ROS not only oxidize cofilin to promote mitochondrial 
dysfunction but also activate SSH via oxidation of 14-3-3ζ, a 
chaperone protein that normally functions to inhibit SSH in 

the nonoxidized form (Kim et al., 2009). Therefore, enhanced 
ROS generation by Aβ, tau, and/or other oxidative stress can 
dephosphorylate and activate cofilin. Another critical pathway of 
cofilin activation is via calcium. Calcineurin, a calcium activated 
phosphatase, dephosphorylates SSH, thereby promoting cofilin 
dephosphorylation and activation (Wang et al., 2005). Given 
that Aβ increases intracellular Ca2+, it has been reported that Aβ 
also activates calcineurin and dephosphorylates cofilin via the 
activation of SSH (Homma et al., 2008). Furthermore, Aβ-induced 
dendritic spine loss is also mediated by a pathway involving 
calcineurin and dephosphorylation of cofilin (Shankar et al., 2007). 
Indeed, inhibition of calcineurin by FK506 is neuroprotective 
in transgenic animal models of AD (Hong et al., 2010; Rozkalne 
et al., 2011). Finally, it has been shown that active PAK, a 
downstream component of focal adhesion and Rac signaling, is 
severely reduced in AD brains. Aβ oligomers induce defects in 
PAK signaling, leading to the activation of cofilin and synaptic 
pathology. Overexpression of active PAK reverses these effects of 
Aβ oligomers (Zhao et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2008). Therefore, Aβ-
induced alterations in Ca2+, ROS, and focal adhesion signaling can 
also induce the activation of cofilin, which in turn, dysregulates 
cytoskeletal dynamics, mitochondria, and tau (Fig. 1B).
One of the pronounced features of multiple neurodegenerative 
diseases, including AD, is the accumulation of filamentous rod-
like structures that contain cofilin and actin (i.e. cofilin-actin rods). 
These inclusions are prominently found in hippocampal and 
cortical tissues of AD brains and transgenic mouse models of AD 
but are missing in normal brains (Maloney and Bamburg, 2007). 
Under stressful situations such as ATP depletion, excitotoxicity, 
or ROS overproduction, cofilin-actin rods form in tandem array 
in neurites of primary neurons (Minamide et al., 2000; Whiteman 
et al., 2009). Treatment of primary neurons with soluble Aβ 
oligomers similarly induces cofilin-actin rod formation in neurites 
of ~20% of neurons in a time course mirroring the depletion of 
ATP induced by the Aβ treatment (Whiteman et al., 2009). It is 
not clear why Aβ does not affect all neurons in a similar fashion, 
but cofilin is dephosphorylated and activated only in neurons that 
form cofilin-actin rods. These inclusions, particularly in neurites, 
are thought to impair transport of proteins and organelles such as 
mitochondria down axons and dendrites. Moreover, a subset of 
cofilin-actin rods contains hyperphosphorylated tau, indicating 
that cofilin-actin cytoskeletal dynamics also alter tau pathology 
(Whiteman et al., 2009). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that 
transgenic mice and flies overexpressing FTDP-17 mutant tau 
promote F- actin assembly, and hyperphosphorylated tau co-
precipitates in rods together with cofilin and actin (Fulga et al., 
2007). These rod structures resemble striated neuropil threads, a

characteristic tau pathology in AD brains. Hyperphosphorylated 
tau loses its affinity for microtubules and mislocalizes in dendritic 
spines, where it functions to remove glutamate receptors and 
impair excitatory synaptic transmission (Hoover et al., 2010). 
Cofilin plays a key role in the organization of actin cytoskeleton 
in dendritic spines as well as Aβ-induced spine loss (Shankar et 
al., 2007). Thus, cofilin and tau may cooperatively control such 
activity and eventually precipitate in rods that contain cofilin, 
actin, and tau when neurons become further stressed by Aβ- 
induced neurotoxic signals.
Cytoskeletal and mitochondrial pathologies are not unique to 
AD but are also key features of both Parkinson’s and Huntington’s 
disease. Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common 
neurodegenerative disease after AD, is characterized by two 
major pathological hallmarks: 1) selective loss of dopaminergic 
neurons in the substantia nigra and 2) intraneuronal inclusions 
termed Lewy bodies mainly composed α-synuclein (Spillantini 
et al., 1997). In addition to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, 
mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis 
of PD. 1-methyl-4-phenyl- 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), 
a mitochondrial complex 1 inhibitor, results the degeneration of 
nigral neurons similar to PD (Langston et al., 1984). Several toxins 
including MPTP and rotenone induce α-synuclein aggregation 
through the inhibition of mitochondrial function (Kowall et 
al., 2000; Lee et al., 2002b). Furthermore, iron or cytochrome 
c enhances the accumulation of α-synuclein (Hashimoto et al., 
1999a; Hashimoto et al., 1999b). The PD-linked α-synuclein A30P 
mutation results in actin cytoskeletal disruption in hippocampal 
neurons (Sousa et al., 2009), and parkin, another PD-linked gene, 
reduces cofilin phosphorylation through the interaction with LIM 
kinase 1 (Lim et al., 2007). Knockdown of PINK1, another PD 
gene, leads to increased aggregation of actin and its binding with 
parkin while increasing cofilin phosphorylation (Kim and Son, 
2010). 
Huntington’s disease (HD) is one of the polyglutamine dis order 
caused by CAG repeat expansion in the exon 1 of the hun ting tin 
(Htt) gene. Mutant huntingtin forms aggregates in the cy to plasm 
and nucleus and negatively affects neuronal via bi li ty, leading to the 
degeneration of the striatum manifested cli ni cally by uncontrollable 
involuntary movements (Spokes, 1980). Mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion has long been associated with neurodegeneration in HD. 
3-Nitro propionic acid, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial citric 
acid cycle, leads to a selective degeneration of the striatum similar 
to that seen in HD (Borlongan et al., 1997). Many studies have 
shown that mutant Htt associates with mitochondria and causes 
impairments in mitochondrial function as well as inhibition of 
vesicular axonal trafficking and mitochondrial motility (Panov 

et al., 2002; Trushina et al., 2004; Orr et al., 2008). It has also been 
shown that mutant Htt induces nuclear rods similar to the cofilin-
actin rods seen in AD (Munsie et al., 2011). 
The involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and pertur ba tions 
in the cytoskeleton and cofilin are common themes in various di-
ffe rent neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, FTD, PD, and 
HD. Although Aβ accumulation is unique to AD, pathogenic 
intracellular proteins such as tau, α- synuclein, and huntingtin all 
promote cytoskeletal aberrations and mitochondrial dysfunction. 
Thus, whether neurotoxic signals are derived from an extracellular 
source (i.e. Aβ) or from within the neuron, mitochondria and cy-
to skeleton appear to be the primary targets of neurodegenerative 
processes. In AD, Aβ induces mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium 
dysregulation, ROS generation, and cytoskeletal aberrations via 
binding to integrins and hyperphosphorylation of tau. In view 
of the findings that cofilin regulates and is regulated by each of 
these key events, we hypothesize that cofilin acts as a central nexus 
regulating the pathogenesis and neurodegenerative changes seen 
in AD and related disorders. Therefore, the regulation of cofilin 
activity from the cell surface (i.e. Aβ binding to integrins or 
other receptors) or from inside neurons (i.e. ROS, Ca2+, and focal 
adhesion signal regulation) and/or its physical interactions with 
the mitochondria, cytoskeleton, focal adhesion complexes, and/
or tau may be attractive therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative 
diseases.
