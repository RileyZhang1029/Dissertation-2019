Glycoengineering is increasingly being recognized as a
powerful tool to generate recombinant glycoproteins with a
customized N-glycosylation pattern. Here, we demonstrate
the modulation of the plant glycosylation pathway toward
the formation of human-type bisected and branched
complex N-glycans. Glycoengineered Nicotiana benthamiana
lacking plant-speciﬁc N-glycosylation (i.e. β1,2-xylose
and core α1,3-fucose) was used to transiently express
human erythropoietin (hEPO) and human transferrin
(hTF) together with modiﬁed versions of human β1,4-man-
nosyl-β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnTIII), α1,3-
mannosyl-β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
(GnTIV)
α1,6-mannosyl-β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
and
(GnTV). hEPO was expressed as a fusion to the IgG-Fc
domain (EPO-Fc) and puriﬁed via protein A afﬁnity chrom-
atography. Recombinant hTF was isolated from the intra-
cellular ﬂuid of inﬁltrated plant leaves. Mass spectrometry-
based N-glycan analysis of hEPO and hTF revealed the
quantitative formation of bisected (GnGnbi) and tri- as well
as tetraantennary complex N-glycans (Gn[GnGn], [GnGn]
Gn and [GnGn][GnGn]). Co-expression of GnTIII together
with GnTIV and GnTV resulted in the efﬁcient generation
of bisected tetraantennary complex N-glycans. Our results
show the generation of recombinant proteins with human-
type N-glycosylation at great uniformity. The strategy
described here provides a robust and straightforward
method for producing mammalian-type N-linked glycans of
deﬁned structures on recombinant glycoproteins, which can
advance glycoprotein research and accelerate the develop-
ment of protein-based therapeutics.

Introduction

(Galβ1,4-GlcNAc-)

The attachment of a bisecting GlcNAc residue and the for-
mation of
tri- and tetraantennary complex N-glycans by
N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III, IV and V are common
extensions of oligosaccharides on mammalian glycoproteins.
The branched structures are associated with various biological
functions including cancer metastasis (reviewed by Zhao et al.
2008) and regulation of T-cell activation (Demetriou et al.
2001). In particular, branching increases the number of poly-
lactosamine
structures on N-glycans,
which are the ligands for galectins resulting in the formation
of speciﬁc lattices with glycoproteins (Lau and Dennis 2008).
In addition, galactosylated tri- and tetraantennary structures
can be further elongated by terminal α2,6- or α2,3-linked
sialic acid. The impact of these branched sialylated N-glycans
on protein function has been impressively shown for one of
the most prominent biopharmaceutical products, recombinant
human erythropoietin (hEPO). hEPO is a glycoprotein
hormone with three potential N-glycosylation sites. Structural
analysis of recombinant hEPO produced in Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells exhibited a number of different sialylated
structures; tetraantennary structures represent the major glyco-
forms (Hokke et al. 1995; Pabst et al. 2007). From a biologi-
cal point of view, a high content of tetraantennary sialylated
oligosaccharide chains is important since there is a positive
correlation between the in vivo activity of
recombinant
EPO and the ratio of tetra- to diantennary oligosaccharides
(Takeuchi et al. 1989; Yuen et al. 2003).

Glycoengineering of

target proteins and host cells has
proven to be a powerful tool for the generation of therapeuti-
cally relevant proteins with proper glycosylation (recently
reviewed by Rich and Withers 2009). Some of these tailored
glycoproteins,
including hEPO, exhibit enhanced in vivo
activities (Umaña et al. 1999; Egrie et al. 2003; Jeong et al.
2009). Engineering of the N-glycosylation pathway of various
(putative) expression hosts led to remarkable success and
resulted in the reconstruction of entire biosynthetic pathways
(Aumiller et al. 2003; Hamilton et al. 2006; Castilho et al.
2010). However, comparatively little attempts have so far been
made to increase the branching of complex N-glycans.

Overexpression of the mammalian β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyl
transferase III (GnTIII) in different expression hosts (i.e. insect
cells, CHO cells, tobacco plants) resulted in the generation of
various glycoforms carrying a bisected GlcNAc accompanied
by an overall heterogeneous N-glycosylation proﬁle (Umaña
et al. 1999; Rouwendal et al. 2007; Okada et al. 2010). The
unwanted microheterogeneity of N-glycosylation is a serious
limitation of these approaches and indicates the importance of
precise subcellular targeting of recombinantly expressed glyco-
syltransferases for efﬁcient N-glycan processing. For example,
targeting of GnTIII to early instead of medial/late Golgi com-
partments resulted in an increase in incompletely processed
bisected hybrid-type structures in CHO cells and in plants
(Ferrara et al. 2006; Frey et al. 2009; Karg et al. 2010).
Comparable studies that demonstrate the successful overexpres-
sion of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IV (GnTIV) or V
(GnTV) in hosts suitable for the production of recombinant
glycoproteins have not been described so far.

Plants are increasingly being recognized as an alternative
expression platform for the production of complex therapeuti-
cally relevant proteins. Plants are able to carry out post-
translational modiﬁcations
like N-glycosylation, and the
recent development of plant viral-based expression systems
allows the efﬁcient expression of recombinant proteins and a
very rapid manufacturing process (Marrillonet et al. 2005;
Sainsbury and Lomonossoff 2008; Bendandi et al. 2010).
Glycoengineering of whole plants has led to the production of
therapeutic glycoproteins with a rather uniform human-like
N-glycosylation pattern (Schähs et al. 2007; Strasser et al.
2008, 2009; Castilho et al. 2010). Moreover monoclonal anti-
bodies expressed in such plants with speciﬁcally altered
N-glycosylation exhibited enhanced activities (Cox et al.
2006; Schuster et al. 2007; Strasser et al. 2009; Forthal et al.
2010). A crucial achievement in using plants as an expression
platform was the generation of mutants that lack plant-speciﬁc
N-glycosylation, i.e. β1,2-xylosylation and core α1,3-fucosy-
lation. Such plants synthesize human-like N-glycans with two
terminal β1,2-linked GlcNAc residues
(GnGn structures:
GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2) at great uniformity (Koprivova et al.
2004; Strasser et al. 2004, 2008; Cox et al. 2006). In all
higher eukaryotes,
these oligosaccharides are the common
core structures for further processing in the Golgi apparatus.
Indeed, such GnGn N-glycans served as acceptor substrates
for the generation of human-type structures, which are nor-
mally absent in plants, i.e. terminal β1,4-galactosylation and
core α1,6-fucosylation (Strasser et al. 2009; Forthal et al.
2010). In mammals, GnGn is also the preferred acceptor sub-
strate for the formation of branched or bisected N-glycans
(Figure 1; Gleeson and Schachter 1983). These structures are
not naturally present in plants due to the lack of the respective
glycosyltransferases.

In this study, we aimed to modulate plant N-glycosylation
toward the generation of bisected,
tri- and tetraantennary
complex N-glycans. To this end, we overexpressed human
GnTIII, IV and V and modiﬁed versions thereof in the gly-
lacking plant-speciﬁc
coengineered Nicotiana benthamiana,
sugar residues (4XT/FT; Strasser et al. 2008). Co-expression
of
the three glycosyltransferases with two model glyco-
proteins, hEPO and hTF, resulted in the efﬁcient attachment

Results
Generation of recombinant hEPO and human transferrin
In a recent study, we have demonstrated the efﬁcient down-
regulation
i.e.
β1,2-xylosylation and core α1,3-fucosylation, in N. benthami-
ana, a plant species widely used for recombinant protein
expression. This was achieved by an RNAi approach, which
suppresses the expression of the two respective glycosyltrans-
ferases β1,2-xylosyl- and core α1,3-fucosyltransferase
(FT)
(4XT/FT line; Strasser et al. 2008). In this study,
these
4XT/FT plants, which synthesize mainly human-type
GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2
structures, were used as
expression host. For N-glycan modeling, two reporter glyco-
proteins were chosen, (i) hEPO, with three N-glycosylation
sites that are decorated with substantial fractions of branched
sialylated N-glycans and (ii) human transferrin (hTF), a serum
protein with two N-glycans that are highly sialylated, however
in its native form devoid of any branching (Yamashita et al.
1993; Pabst et al. 2007). The cDNAs encoding the reporter
glycoproteins were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana
using a potent viral-based expression system (magnICON,
Marillonnet
et al. 2005). hTF was expressed with a
C-terminal strep-tag and hEPO was C-terminally fused to an
IgG-Fc domain (EPO-Fc). Previous studies have demonstrated
an enhanced stability of such EPO-Fc constructs (Bitonti et al.
2004). Due to a conserved N-glycosylation site within the Fc
domain,
an additional
glyco-reporter. Both hTF and EPO-Fc were cloned into a
tobacco mosaic virus
(TMV)-based magnICON vector
(Figure 2B), and 4XT/FT leaves were inﬁltrated with appro-
priate agrobacterium strains. Leaves were harvested 4–5 days
post inﬁltration, and recombinant protein expression was mon-
itored by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis
immunoblotting. Cellular
fractionation revealed hTF to be efﬁciently secreted to the
intracellular ﬂuid (IF). A clear band migrating at (cid:1)80 kDa,
the expected size of glycosylated hTF, was present in the IF
in non-inﬁltrated
(Figure 3A). This band, which is absent
leaves, reacted with an anti-strep antibody (data not shown).

proteins displayed the presence of signiﬁcant amounts of
bisecting complex N-glycans (GnGnbi) on the EPO glycopep-
and XTGnTIII
tides
(Figure 5B and C and Supplementary data, Figure S1).
GnGnbi was also the predominant peak when STGnTIII was
co-expressed with hTF. Targeting of GnTIII to an early stage
of the biosynthetic pathway (GMIIGnTIII) was less effective in
the formation of GnGnbi structures on EPO-Fc. Note, in some
cases, minor amounts of the bisected complex glycoforms
present on the EPO glycopeptide, but not on hTF, were also
fucosylated (GnGnbiF). In contrast, the GnGn structure of the
Fc glycopeptide was only slightly processed toward GnGnbi
structures (Figure 5A and Supplementary data, Figure S1).

We also investigated whether plant-derived hEPO contains
an O-linked oligosaccharide attached to Ser126. MS analysis
of peptides derived from the tryptic digestion of puriﬁed
EPO-Fc did not show any evidence for the presence of
O-linked glycan structures (data not shown). This result is
consistent with recent studies showing that N. benthamiana
lack the machinery for
formation of mucin-type
O-glycosylation (Daskalova et al. 2010).

Generation of binary vectors for expression of
glycosyltransferases
To obtain the attachment of bisecting GlcNAc residues and
the formation of tri- and tetraantennary N-glycans on the
recombinant
human
enzymes GnTIII, IV and V were transiently expressed using
binary vectors. These vectors allow low-to-moderate protein
expression, which is usually sufﬁcient
to achieve efﬁcient
modiﬁcation of the N-glycosylation pattern (Strasser et al.
2009). As sub-Golgi
targeting of recombinantly expressed
glycosyltransferases has profound implications on the ﬁnal
glycosylation pattern of the glycoproteins, GnTIII, IV and V
were fused to different Golgi targeting signals. The native
cytoplasmic tail,
transmembrane domain and stem (CTS)
region, responsible for their sub-Golgi targeting in mamma-
lian cells, was replaced by different CTS domains derived
from plant N-glycan processing enzymes
rat
α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST), a well-known trans-Golgi target-
ing sequence in plants (Boevink et al. 1998; Wee et al. 1998;
Schoberer et al. 2010; Figure 2A).

Generation of bisecting GlcNAc containing N-glycans

In order to obtain the optimal amounts of bisected oligosac-
charides and at the same time avoid interference of GnTIII
activity with endogenous plant N-glycan processing enzymes
as observed in previous studies, we evaluated different
sub-Golgi
targeting sequences. The catalytic domain of
human GnTIII was fused to the CTS regions from early/
medial (Golgi α-mannosidase II, GMII), medial (Arabidopsis
alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase, FUT11; β1,2-xylosyltransferase,
XT) and from one late acting enzyme (ST; Figure 2A). The
resulting chimeric fusion proteins (GMIIGnTIII, FUT11GnTIII,

MGnbi).

Branching of plant N-glycans

Generation of triantennary N-glycans on hEPO and hTF
To produce triantennary complex N-glycans in plants human
GnTIV (isozyme A), which adds a GlcNAc residue to the
α1,3-mannose in β1,4-linkage (Figure 1), was co-expressed
with the reporter proteins, and their N-glycans were analyzed
by LC-ESI-MS. Apart from the native form, three different
CTS–GnTIV fusions were generated potentially targeting the
enzyme to different sub-Golgi compartments (Figure 2A). The
native GnTIV (fullGnTIV) and the STGnTIV chimeric fusion
proteins did not signiﬁcantly change the Fc glycosylation
proﬁle. However, the constructs were able to modify to some
extent the N-glycans from EPO resulting in a mixture of glyco-
forms that assign to di- and triantennary complex N-glycans
(Supplementary data, Figure S2). On the other hand,
co-expression of either XTGnTIV or FUT11GnTIV resulted in
the formation of high amounts of structures that carry an
additional GlcNAc residue on EPO and hTF glycopeptides

(Figure 6 and Supplementary data, Figure S2). Even the Fc
glycopeptide was found to carry signiﬁcant amounts of trian-
tennary complex N-glycans (Figure 6A). In addition, some of
the minor peaks corresponding to fucosylated oligosaccharides
displayed the incorporation of additional GlcNAc residues in
both EPO and hTF.

To initiate branching at the α1,6-mannosyl-arm of GnGn
human GnTV was transiently expressed together with EPO-Fc
and hTF. The catalytic domain of GnTV was fused to the
CTS region of FUT11 (FUT11GnTV) since this targeting
sequence resulted in highly efﬁcient formation of triantennary
complex N-glycans when fused to GnTIV (Figure 6). Upon
FUT11GnTV expression,
the formation of structures corre-
sponding to [GnGn]Gn on EPO and hTF glycopeptides was
detected (Figure 7B and C). A small amount of fucosylated
also identiﬁed on EPO glycopeptides
[GnGn]Gn was
(Figure 7B). In contrast to that, the N-glycosylation site on

the Fc fragment did not show any peaks corresponding to
putative branched complex N-glycans when co-expressed with
FUT11GnTV (Figure 7A).

Generation of tetraantennary N-glycans on hEPO and hTF
The expression of GnTIV and GnTV has shown that plant
complex N-glycans can be modiﬁed toward the formation of
triantennary structures. To elongate both arms simultaneously,
we co-expressed FUT11GnTIV and FUT11GnTV with EPO-Fc
or hTF and performed LC-ESI-MS. The glycopeptides from
EPO and hTF exhibited a predominant peak corresponding to
a tetraantennary complex N-glycan structure ([GnGn][GnGn])
and minor amounts of triantennary structures (GnGnGni) as
well as GnGn (Figure 8B and C). Consistent with the pre-
vious data for the expression of FUT11GnTV, the Fc glycopep-
tide carried mainly GnGn structures, accompanied with minor
fractions of oligomannosidic structures. In order to evaluate
whether the three mammalian glycosyltransferases can act in
a synchronized mode, we co-expressed FUT11GnTIV and

FUT11GnTV with different GnTIII constructs (GMIIGnTIII,
XTGnTIII, FUT11GnTIII and STGnTIII). Co-expression of
STGnTIII, which targets GnTIII to a late Golgi compartment,
resulted in the formation of signiﬁcant amounts of complex
tetraantennary glycans also carrying a bisecting GlcNAc
[GnGn][GnGn]bi on EPO and hTF (Figure 9). This oligosac-
charide structure was also identiﬁed on the EPO glycopeptides
when GnTIII was fused to a targeting signal for medial-Golgi
location (XTGnTIII and FUT11GnTIII) but was not detected
when GMIIGnTIII was co-expressed with FUT11GnTIV and
FUT11GnTV (Supplementary data, Figure S3).

neered ΔXT/FT plants.

Discussion
In this study, we show the efﬁcient formation of GnGn, tri-
and tetraantennary N-glycans and/or the incorporation of a
bisecting GlcNAc on two glycoproteins, hEPO and hTF. This
was achieved by the overexpression of the respective mamma-
lian enzymes in the expression host ΔXT/FT, a glycosylation
mutant with a targeted down-regulation of XT and FT
expression (Strasser et al. 2008). The expression of EPO-Fc
and hTF in ΔXT/FT without additional mammalian glycosyl-
transferases resulted in the formation of virtually exclusively
GnGn structures on all glycosylation sites particularly on hTF,
which conﬁrms the versatile utility of this N-glycosylation
mutant as potential expression host for recombinant glyco-
proteins. The GnGn glycoform constitutes the pivotal inter-
mediate for the formation of complex-type N-glycans in all
higher eukaryotes. Upon the expression of mammalian β1,4-
galactosyltransferase (GalT) and core α1,6-fucosyltransfera-
sere in ΔXT/FT, we could show the efﬁcient generation of

Branching of plant N-glycans

β1,4-galactosyled and core α1,6-fucosylated N-glycans on
recombinantly expressed IgG (Strasser et al. 2008; Forthal
et al. 2010). Here, we extended our efforts in humanizing the
plant N-glycosylation pathway toward the generation of
bisected and branched complex N-glycans, which are usually
not synthesized in plants.

Previous studies have shown that the expression of GnTIII in
wild-type plants resulted in the attachment of a bisecting
GlcNAc (Rouwendal et al. 2007; Frey et al. 2009; Karg et al.
2010). However, as the native human GnTIII is very likely tar-
geted to a medial-Golgi compartment overlapping mainly with
FT, but also with N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GnTII)
and XT different incompletely processed glycoforms were gen-
erated (Rouwendal et al. 2007; Frey et al. 2009). This illustrates
that the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc blocks further proces-
sing of N-glycans in plants just as in mammalian cells
(Schachter 1986). Consistent with this ﬁnding, we found high
levels of GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2 peaks in addition to the pres-
ence of signiﬁcant amounts of bisected complex N-glycans
upon the expression of GnTIII targeted to an early sub-Golgi
compartment
indicates that either
GnTIII is not very active when fused to the GMII-CTS region or
the bisecting GlcNAc is transferred to GlcNAc1Man3GlcNAc2
which blocks further processing by GnTII.

(GMIIGnTIII). This result

The importance of proper sub-Golgi targeting of glycosyl-
transferases for appropriate N-glycan modiﬁcation in plants has
also been emphasized in other studies. Interference with the
endogenous plant N-glycan processing pathway resulted in the
generation of aberrant structures. For example, when native
human GalT was expressed in plants, galactosylated and
incompletely processed N-glycans were generated (Palacpac
et al. 1999; Bakker et al. 2001) and a CTS–GalT fusion that
directed the enzyme to an early stage of the pathway led to an
increase in incompletely processed N-glycans (Bakker et al.
2006). However, targeting GalT to a late stage of the pathway
using rat ST-CTS resulted in the generation of fully processed
β1,4-galactosylated diantennary N-glycans (Strasser et al.
2009). Here, we demonstrate that GnTIV generates triantenn-
ary structures particularly efﬁciently upon targeting the
enzyme to medial-Golgi compartments using FUT11- and
XT-CTS sequences. Such oligosaccharides were synthesized at
reduced levels when the full-length version of the human
enzyme was used, indicating improper subcellular targeting of
the native human GnTIV in ΔXT/FT plants.

N-Glycans of hTF generated upon co-expression of GnTIII (A), GnTIV (B)
and GnTV (C), respectively, were enzymatically released, reduced and
subjected to LC-ESI-MS with a carbon column. The elution position of
different N-glycan standards is indicated by arrows. LC-MS data are shown as
selected ion chromatograms for glycans with 0, 2 or 3 GlcNAc residues on
the non-reducing side, for masses of 913.4, 1319.4 and the doubly charged

Apart

(Pabst

from the generation of

tri- and tetraantennary
complex N-glycans on EPO, we could also generate these
structures on a glycoprotein (hTF), which normally does not
contain branched oligosaccharides
al. 2007),
showing that different glycoproteins can be furnished with
novel non-native N-glycan structures. However, the oligosac-
charide of the Fc domain in the EPO–Fc fusion was not very
efﬁciently branched and modiﬁed with a bisecting GlcNAc
residue. In addition, we show the efﬁcient generation of
bisected tetraantennary oligosaccharides, which are not com-
monly found on mammalian glycoproteins. This is achieved
by the sequential transfer of GlcNAc residues with GnTIII
the ﬁnal stage in order to prevent blocking of
acting at
GnTIV and V once the bisected GlcNAc is added. Our results
may serve as an example that ﬁne-tuning of the intracellular

to the diverse

In this study, we describe a robust and straightforward
method for producing glycoproteins with a tailor-made
mammalian-type N-glycosylation pattern in plants at great
homogeneity. Notably, due
endogenous
N-glycosylation repertoire, such homogenous N-glycosylation
pattern can hardly be achieved by any mammalian cell-based
expression system. Glycoengineered plant-made glycoproteins
allow the analysis of the impact of different glycoforms on
glycoproteins more in detail and may advance the develop-
ment of glycoprotein-based therapeutics. We have recently
demonstrated the efﬁcient in planta formation of human-type
α2,6-sialylated N-glycans on recombinant proteins (Castilho
et al. 2010). Together with the results described here,
it
appears possible to use glycoengineered plants in the near
future for the generation of glycoproteins with branched and
sialylated N-glycans,
the structures needed for optimal
efﬁcacy of important therapeutic products such as EPO.

GnTIII: For different targeting of the human β1,4-mannosyl-
β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnTIII),
the catalytic
domain and part of the putative stem region (comprising
amino acids 35–531) were fused to the CTS region of differ-
ent enzymes. For late Golgi targeting, the catalytic domain
was fused to the CTS region of the rat ST. First, the catalytic
domain was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁed from
cDNA of HepG2 (human hepatocellular liver carcinoma) cells
with the primer pair GnTIII F1/R1 (Supplementary data,
Table S1). The PCR product was digested with XbaI/BamHI
and cloned into pPT2M binary vector (Strasser et al. 2005).
the α2,6-sialyltransferase CTS region (comprising
Then,
amino acids 1–52) was PCR ampliﬁed from plasmid
pGA482rST (Wee et al. 1998) with the primer pair ST 1F/R1.
The PCR product was digested with XbaI/XhoI and cloned
into the plasmid containing the GnTIII catalytic domain. The
resulting plant expression vector was named STGnTIII
(Figure 2). The other GnTIII expression vectors were gener-
ated as described in Supplementary data, Methods.

the CTS region was ampliﬁed from A. thaliana cDNA using
the primer pair FUT11 F1/R1 (Supplementary data, Table SI).
The PCR product was digested with XbaI/BamHI and ligated
into pPT2M to generate the vector pFUT11. The catalytic

generated as described in Supplementary data, Methods.

GnTV: To amplify the fragment encoding a part of the stem

RNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI). Reverse tran-
scriptase–PCR was performed with the clone-speciﬁc primers
pVTBacHis 1/2 and the cDNA was subcloned into pCR4
Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). To assemble the FUT11GnTV
fusion construct, the pFUT11 plasmid was used as a template
to amplify the FUT11-CTS region with the primers FUT11
F1/FUT11-GnTV R1. In parallel, the GnTV fragment (com-
prising amino acids 31–741) was ampliﬁed from the pCR4
Blunt-TOPO clone using the primers FUT11-GnTV F1/GnTV
R2. The two overlapping ampliﬁcation products were mixed
together and used as template in a third PCR using the
primers FUT11 F1/GnTV R2. The assembled product was
digested with XbaI/XhoI and ligated into pPT2M. All binary
vectors were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens

based vectors were transformed into the A. tumefaciens strain
GV3101 pmp90.

Plant material and transient protein expression
Nicotiana benthamiana 4XT/FT plants (Strasser et al. 2008)
were grown in a growth chamber at 22°C with a16 h light/8 h
dark photoperiod. Five-to-six-week-old plants were used for
agroinﬁltration experiments (Strasser et al. 2008; Castilho
et al. 2010). To express the reporter proteins (EPO-Fc and
hTF), the TMV3’ vector containing the respective cDNA was
co-inﬁltrated with the corresponding 5′ vector containing the
SP and the binary vector containing the recombinase
(Marillonnet et al. 2005). Binary vectors containing the

cDNA of
glycosyltransferases were
co-inﬁltrated with the viral-based vectors (OD600 of (cid:1)0.15–
0.2 for all agrobacteria).

EPO-Fc puriﬁcation
Agroinﬁltrated leaves (200–300 mg) were homogenized in
liquid nitrogen and resuspended in 600 µL pre-cooled extrac-
tion buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 40 mM ascorbic acid,
500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), incubated on ice for 10 min
and subsequently cleared by centrifugation (9000 × g for 20
min at 4°C). The supernatant was incubated for 1.5 h at 4°C
with 15–20 µL rProteinA Sepharose™ Fast Flow (GE
Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) previously washed with 1×
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After a brief spin down, the
supernatant was discarded and the sepharose was washed
three times with 1× PBS using Micro Bio-Spin chromato-
graphy columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). To extract
the
EPO–Fc fusion protein from the column, 20 µL of 2×
Laemmli buffer (125 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerin,
4% SDS; 10% mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) was
applied, incubated for 5 min at 95°C and centrifuged for 1
min (9000 × g). The samples were then directly used for
SDS–PAGE.

Isolation of IF
Two to three inﬁltrated leaves were immersed in buffer sol-
ution (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM
EDTA) and subjected to vacuum (2×5 min). IF was collected
by low-speed centrifugation (900 × g for 15 min). The IF was
mixed with 2× Laemmli buffer and incubated for 5 min at 95°
C prior to SDS–PAGE.

Analysis of glycopeptides
N-Glycan analysis of the reporter proteins was carried out by
LC-ESI-MS of tryptic glycopeptides as described previously
(Stadlmann et al. 2008; Strasser et al. 2008). Brieﬂy,
the
SDS–PAGE bands corresponding to the EPO–Fc fusion
protein ((cid:1)55 kDa) and hTF ((cid:1)80 kDa) were excised from the
gel, S-alkylated, digested with trypsin and subsequently
analyzed by LC-ESI-MS. During this procedure,
four
glycopeptides are generated for the EPO–Fc fusion protein:
two glycopeptides for the Fc part are due to incomplete diges-
tion (glycopeptide 1, E293EQYNSTYR301; glycopeptide 2,
T289KPREEQYNSTYR301) and another two for EPO since
two out of the three N-glycosylation sites (Asn24 and Asn38)
are found on the same glycopeptide (glycopeptide 1,
E21AENITTGCAEHCSLNENITVPDTK45; glycopeptide 2,
G77QALLVNSSQPWEPLQLHVDK97). For hTF,
the two
glycosylation sites at Asn432 and Asn630 are discriminated by
(glycopeptide 1, C421GLVPVLAENY
two glycopeptides
NKSDNCEDTPEAGYFAVAVVKK453; glycopeptide 2, Q603
QQHLFGSNVTDCSGNFCLFR623).

Structural identiﬁcation of N-glycans
The identiﬁcation of the GlcNAc linkage to β1,4-, α1,3- and
α1,6-mannosyl residues as found on bisected and triantennary
N-glycans was carried out by chromatography on porous gra-
phitic carbon with detection by ESI-MS (Pabst et al. 2007).

Branching of plant N-glycans

The elution order of free, reduced N-glycans was compared
with that of speciﬁc standards prepared using glycosidase
digests of
agalacto-EPO and human IgG
N-glycans (Pabst et al. 2007; Stadlmann et al. 2008).
