An association between oral disease/periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been considered since
the early 1820s. The early treatment was tooth eradication. Epidemiological studies suggest that the
prevalence of RA and periodontitis may be similar and about 5% of the population are aged 50 years or older.
RA is considered as an autoimmune disease whereas periodontitis has an infectious etiology with a complex
inflammatory response. Both diseases are chronic and may present with bursts of disease activity. Association
studies have suggested odds ratios of having RA and periodontitis varying from 1.8:1 (95% CI: 1.03.2, NS)
to 8:1 (95% CI: 2.922.1, pB0.001). Genetic factors are driving the host responses in both RA and
periodontitis. Tumor necrosis factor-a, a proinflammatory cytokine, regulates a cascade of inflammatory
events in both RA and periodontitis. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a common pathogen in periodontal
infection. P. gingivalis has also been identified in synovial fluid. The specific abilities of P. gingivalis to
citrullinate host peptides by proteolytic cleavage at Arg-X peptide bonds by arginine gingipains can induce
autoimmune responses in RA through development of anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. In addition,
P. gingivalis carries heat shock proteins (HSPs) that may also trigger autoimmune responses in subjects with
RA. Data suggest that periodontal therapies combined with routine RA treatments further improve
RA status.
Conclusions: Periodontal infection (P. gingivalis) carries a unique risk for development of autoimmune
antibodies associated with RA. Patients with RA have either lost many teeth or usually have severe
periodontitis. Additional research, both in regards to basic mechanisms as well as clinical studies, are
necessary before it can be said that there are causative links between RA and periodontitis. Cross-disciplinary
research in well-defined populations should be performed to further enhance knowledge and develop clinical
strategies how to coordinate therapy and risk assessments of RA and periodontitis.

During the last 200 years, a possible association

between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and oral
disease (periodontitis) has been debated. Recent
research with focus on inflammation in relation to
infection by Porphyromonas gingivalis has identified an
infection-immune response as one explanatory factor to
why subjects with periodontitis may develop RA. Experi-
ences from anti-inflammatory therapies in the manage-
ment of RA may be useful also in the management of
periodontitis. In the present review, studies on the

age and is three times more prevalent in women with 5%
of women aged older than 55 years being affected (1, 2).

ending within 5 years and not reoccurring), (2) polycyclic
(fluctuating with several episodes of disease activity, and
(3) progressive (continuing to increase in severity and
unremitting). Clinically, RA is currently diagnosed ac-
cording to the 2010 American College of Rheumatology
(ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism
(EULAR) classification that includes nine criteria (4)
[http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/classification/
ra/ra_2010.asp].

The diagnosis of RA is based on the clinical history,
physical examination, blood count [i.e. eosinophil sedi-
mentation rate, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and
immunoglobulin rheumatoid factor (RF)]. In addition,
imaging methods [radiographs, magnetic resonance im-
aging (MRI), computer imaging methods (CAT and bone
scans)] are used to assess various joints. RA typically
manifests with signs of inflammation, with the affected
joints being swollen, warm, painful, and stiff. The
inflammatory activity leads to tendon tethering, erosion,
and destruction of the joint surface. This results in joint
deformity impairing the range of movement and is often
associated with pain.

The etiology of RA is not well understood. Most likely,
there is a combination of genetic (including epigenetics 
changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype caused
by other mechanisms than changes in the underlying
DNA sequence), environmental, hormonal, and infec-
tious co-factors. RA has, in addition to periodontitis, also
been associated with other diseases such as heart diseases,
lung diseases, gastrointestinal diseases (including Morbus
Crohn), osteoporosis, and skin diseases.

Periodontitis is a common disease affecting between 3
and 60% (depending on the criteria used to define
periodontitis) (5). The current differential criteria for
periodontal diseases include gingivitis, chronic period-
ontitis, aggressive periodontitis, periodontitis as a man-
ifestation of systemic diseases, necrotizing periodontal
diseases, abscesses of the periodontium, and periodontitis
associated with endodontic lesions (6). Since the late
1990s, there has been an increasing interest in other
diseases that can be associated with periodontitis. From a
historical perspective, RA has been associated with
periodontitis since the early 19th century when Benjamin
Rush (American physician and politician) identified that
total tooth eradication was a cure for ‘rheuma’. Therapy
with extraction of all teeth was common in the early 20th
century, promoting the focal infection theory and the
values of full mouth tooth eradication. This continued to
be the praxis in many countries until Cecil and coworkers
in the late 1930s concluded that tooth eradication was not
a solution to the treatment of RA. In 1952, the American
Medical Association clarified that this practice was not
based on scientific evidence and that tooth eradication
should not be considered as a treatment approach to
reduce the severity, or symptoms of RA (7).

To what extent the eradication of all teeth in subjects
with advanced periodontitis has a systemic positive
impact continues to be an open question. The local
infection-driven inflammatory process of the periodon-
tium has,
in general, been proposed as one possible
mechanism triggering systemic inflammatory processes
or spread of infection (8, 9). Taylor et al. (10) identified
that if non-smoking subjects with severe periodontitis
had all their teeth extracted, a significant decrease in
serum CRP, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, fibrino-
gen, WBC, and platelet counts would occur. Thus, it
appears that eradication of an oral source of infection has
systemic effects resulting in a reduction of systemic
inflammation. In addition, others have shown that non-
surgical periodontal therapy can result in not only an
immediate severe increase in serum CRP levels but also
that CRP values decrease to pretreatment values within
30 days (11). Bacteremia with an oral bacterial origin
may, in part, explain the increase in serum markers of
inflammation. Both observations can be used to accept
the proof of principle that periodontitis is not an isolated
local disease. Periodontitis is a disease with involvement
of soft and hard tissues, a complex infectious etiology
with significant inflammatory ‘systemic’ consequences.

The periodontium, a bacterial habitat and a
systemic disease in the susceptible host
Consistent with RA, a cyclic nature of chronic period-
ontitis has been identified (12, 13). The infectious
etiology of periodontitis is well established (not refer-
enced here). The subgingival biofilm may be in flux and
constantly respond to nutritional and other challenges.
Data suggest that the subgingival microbiological profile
is also dependent on gene clusters, and it
is not
necessarily the periodontal probing pocket depth that
defines the microbiological profile. Data suggest an
important genetic impact on the infectious susceptibility
in subjects with periodontitis (14). The periodontal
‘niche’ harbors a uniquely broad spectrum of bacteria
(15, 16).

A single pathogen fulfilling the DNA sequence-based
identification of pathogens as required by the modified
Henle-Koch postulate (17) has not been identified for the
periodontal
infection. In part, the criteria have been
fulfilled in that it is possible to infect the periodontium
with P. gingivalis (18) and that immunization against this
pathogen can control the infection in the same animal
model (19, 20). Data have also shown that purified
porphypains from P. gingivalis and used as a vaccine
provides protection against periodontitis in a non-human
primate model (21). This may be an important observa-
tion, especially in the relation to citrullination (see below)
and a possibility to control P. gingivalis-induced citrulli-
nation. Many of the bacterial species considered as
putative pathogens and identified in the oral cavity can

also be found at other locations. This may be a
consequence of host susceptibility, a natural habitat for
such bacteria, or infectious etiology of disease (i.e.
2225). The effects of bacteremia from oral sources
have been difficult to study.

Genetics in periodontitis and rheumatoid
arthritis
Genome-wide association studies have identified replic-
able, genetic associations between common single nucleo-
tide polymorphisms
common
autoimmune and inflammatory (immune-mediated) dis-
eases such as RA (26). In recent years, several studies
have also been published assessing genetic factors in
periodontitis. Due to the lack of power and study design
flaws almost, all genetic variants associated with period-
ontitis that have been published are, therefore, question-
able (27). Notwithstanding, genetic factors are driving
immune responses in general, and there can be no doubt
that the susceptibility to periodontitis can be derived
from genetic mechanisms. The most appropriate ap-
proach to studies of genetic factors in periodontitis
should be a cross-disciplinary medical study approach.

The literature on the relationship between genetic
factors and RA is extensive. Studies have yielded novel
genetic loci underlying several common diseases, includ-
ing RA. Thus, ‘leukocyte activation and differentiation’,
‘pattern-recognition receptor signaling pathway’, and
‘chemokines and their receptors’ can explain mutation-
induced RA (28). Research investigating the relationship
between polymorphisms and disease has demonstrated
strong links between susceptibility to RA and genetic
factors. Different genetic markers have found human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) genetic factors as explanatory
to early onset of RA (29). In addition, and due to the
aging process and immunosenescence, telomere erosion
appears to proceed more rapidly in patients with RA than
in healthy control subjects, resulting in an early onset of
the disease in RA susceptible individuals (30).

Environmental factors can cause reversible and non-
reversible genetic changes. Heritable changes in gene
expression or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms
other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence are
studied through epigenetics. Epigenetic changes occur
without a direct change in the genetic sequence and may
be reversible. Epigenetic alterations are sources of
potential genetic defects resulting in gene malfunctions
and may be linked to both RA (31) and periodontitis
(32). Reduced synovial expression of histone deacetylases
(HDACs) is proposed to contribute to pathology in RA
(33). Epigenetic changes have been linked to the X
chromosome. This may, partly, explain the gender
difference in RA prevalence. Not only gender, viral
infection, hormones, and geography but also nutrition
and chemicals have been identified through epigenetics.

Rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis

Both intrinsic to the DNA sequence (polymorphism and
mutations) and extrinsic to the DNA sequence (DNA
methylation) stable and heritable changes in gene expres-
sion without changes in the genetic code can occur. There
are merging data suggesting that dietary factors, such as
micro-nutrients and non-nutrient dietary components,
can modify epigenetic marks (34).

Rheumatoid arthritis and infection in the
susceptible host
A combination of environmental and genetic factors with
antibodies directed against cyclic citrullinated peptide
(anti-CCP) has been associated with the onset of
RA (29).

Citrullination or deamination is the term used for a
genetic modification of the amino acid arginine in a
protein into the amino acid citrulline and caused by
enzymatic activity through peptidylarginine deaminases
(PADs). Data have shown that anti-CCP antibody in
addition to the RF predate the onset of RA with anti-
CCP antibody levels having the highest predictive value
(35).

In 2004, Rosenstein et al. (36) introduced the hypoth-
esis that P. gingivalis, which is the sole microorganism
documented to express PAD, would allow individuals
with periodontitis to be exposed to citrullinated antigens,
predisposing to development of anti-cyclic citrullinated
peptide (CCP) antibodies and to be at risk for RA.
Thus, P. gingivalis rapidly generates citrullinated host
peptides by proteolytic cleavage at Arg-X peptide bonds
by arginine gingipains,
followed by citrullination of
carboxy-terminal arginines by bacterial peptidylarginine
deiminase (37). Studies have shown that P. gingivalis
contains a range of endogenous citrullinated proteins that
are not present in other common oral pathogens (38).
The expression of citrullinated autoantigens in synovial
fluid indicates the important role of citrullination in RA
(39). Oral bacterial infection (P. gingivalis) may, therefore,
play a role in peptide citrullination and involved in loss of
self-tolerance and development of RA (40). Data suggest
that citrullinated proteins are also present in the gingiva
of patients with periodontitis (41). Immunization with
cysteine proteases purified from P. gingivalis against
periodontitis may, therefore, have significance also in
the prevention and management of RA through humoral
factors and with an impact on cytokine production and
control of infection and inflammation (21). There are few,
if any, other studies that have linked specific bacteria as
potentially causative bacteria in RA. Thus, P. gingivalis
may directly be linked to RA through citrullination and
induction of antipeptidyl citrulline antibodies reacting to
citrullinated human self-proteins (41). This may be the
most convincing evidence that a pathogen associated with
periodontitis has an impact in the development and
progression of another disease (RA). This concept may

been reported in cases with chronic periodontitis
(50). These findings are also consistent with in vitro
experiments (51).

Markers of inflammation in periodontitis and
rheumatoid arthritis
One of the conditions in RA has been identified as
synovitis. Synovitis is characterized by leukocyte infiltra-
tion, proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes, osteo-
clast activation, presence of mast cells, B cells, and
characteristic CD4/CD8 ratio (4244). The synovial
fluid is
rich in proinflammatory cytokines. Several
interleukins (ILs) (i.e. IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, and IL-
17) (45) as well as NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) (46) can
be associated with RA. Similar proinflammatory cyto-
kines have also been associated with inflammation in
periodontitis (47).

The proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-a, is of special interest for the understanding of
immune responses in relation to a linkage between
RA and periodontitis. The literature on the effects of
elevated serum levels of TNF-a and the association
between TNF-a and RA is extensive (i.e. (48)). Due to
the fact that treatment with anti-TNF-a medication is
commonly used to control for the inflammatory process
in RA, such therapy may also be relevant
for the
management of periodontitis.

TNF-a is released in response to lipopolysaccharide
and other bacterial byproducts. A local increase in TNF-

In regard to proinflammatory cytokines and immune
responses in periodontitis, detailed information from an
extensive literature review is currently available (49). TNF-a
has been of interest in periodontal research as this pro-
inflammatory cytokine while TNF-a upregulates produc-
tion of prostaglandin E2 and matrix-metalloproteinases
(MMPs), causing osteoclast stimulation. This results
in bone resorption, a prominent pathogenic feature in
periodontitis. A higher expression of protease-activated

Several studies on the association between RA have been
published. A summary of study designs and results
obtained from such studies are presented in a time-
sequential order (Table 1). There are few large cross-
sectional studies assessing the associations between RA
and periodontitis. Most studies have used the criteria for
RA defined by the ACR (53), and the criteria for
periodontitis defined by the American Association of
Periodontology. The studies presented in Table 1 were
identified through screening documents published in
peer-reviewed journals in the English language since
2001 and avoiding other review articles. The primary
focus was also on human studies.

Genetic factors have been identified for the association
between RA and periodontitis (55, 63, 67). Odds ratios
that subjects with RA have more frequently and with
more severe periodontitis varied between OR: 2.2:1 (52)
and OR: 8.1:1 (59), whereas one study found no
significant association (57). Periodontal disease severity
(OR: 2.1:1) was ranked as number three as a predictive
factor for RA with female gender (OR: 7:1) and smoking
(OR: 2.9:1) as the primary predictors (63). Other studies
have not assessed the likelihood of an association but
rather defined shared etiological factors or host response
mechanisms between RA and periodontitis.

One of the problems in assessing proinflammatory
factors in RA and periodontitis is that some studies
represent convenience studies where subjects at the time
of assessment were treated with a variety of common
medication against RA symptoms (see below). Thus, the
lack of higher TNF-a and CRP serum levels in subjects
with both RA and periodontitis may be explained by the
impact of anti-inflammatory routine RA medications (58,
61, 63, 67). Another problem with the studies identified
can be linked to the cross-sectional nature of study design
and that the chronicity of periodontitis and previous
treatments of periodontitis or RA were not accounted for.

RA factor, ESR, and CRP values in

between RA/periodontitis and RA/peri-
odontitis t-PA total amounts and conc.

Detected in serum: P. intermedia (73.6%);
T. denticola (21%); T. forsythia (31.5%);
P. gingivalis (42.1%).

Subjects with RA were more often
edentulous and did not attend
dental regularly and to have more
periodontitis if dentate.

Gingivitis and periodontitis are
related to high levels of circulating
TNF-a in subjects who are RA.

Subjects with RA have signifi-
cantly more CAL (periodontitis)
than non-RA subjects.
Oral hygiene may only partially
account for this association.

The coexistence of RA and peri-
odontitis does not seem to affect
clinical periodontal findings or
systemic markers of RA. The lack
of difference may be the result of
anti-inflammatory treatment of
RA subjects.

P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, and
T. denticola were the most pre-
valent species found in synovial
fluid.
Possibly, a free transport of DNA
to synovial fluid.
The presence of P. gingivalis in
synovial fluid supports the theory
on anti-CCP and citrullination.

and periodontitis assessed the presence of pathogens (by
PCR method) associated with periodontitis. The study
identified that, in bacterial samples from knee joints, such
bacteria were found in 100% of samples including one or
several species. Among the most prevalent species were
Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, and P. gin-
givalis. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was the
least commonly found microorganism. Findings from an
experimental study could also identify counts of A.
actinomycetemcomitans as a factor in bone loss in RA-
induced mice (64). Others have shown that anticitrullin
antibody levels were significantly higher in RA subjects
with advanced periodontitis than in RA subjects without
periodontitis (63). Thus, such studies suggest that key
pathogens in periodontitis are associated with RA. It
should be recognized that one study has failed to identify
pathogens in periodontitis as associated with RA (67) and
may be explained by confounders (i.e. smoking), medica-
tion, that all subjects had RA, or that periodontitis was
defined through a screening index.

Standard therapy in the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis
This section, briefly presents medications used in the
treatment of RA. (The reader is referred to the pharma-
cological literature for detailed information.) The pri-
mary objectives in the treatment of patients with RA are
to reduce inflammation and to correct pathological
abnormalities to enhance quality of
life. Treatment
options include a variety of medications, efforts to reduce
joint stress, physical therapy, and surgical intervention.
Medications that are commonly used in RA treat-
ment
include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents
(NSAIDs  aspirin, ibuprofen, COX-2 inhibitor) corti-
costeroids, and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
(DMARDs). In addition, injectable gold therapy (until
late 1990s), cyclosporine, diet, and climate-humidity
change are considered.

NSAID drugs can reduce acute inflammation and
decrease pain. Such medications alone do not change
the course of RA. Corticosteroids have both anti-
inflammatory and immune-regulatory activity but have
also been associated with several side effects (i.e. weight
gain and a Cushing-like appearance). Only DMARD
agents can change the course of RA but have a delayed
effect and differ from NSAIDs or cortisone therapy.
Currently, methotrexate is considered as the primary
DMARD agent in the management of RA. The effects
are related to effects on TNF-a pathways and the
inhibition of an enzyme involved in the metabolism of
folic acid. Methotrexate in higher dosages is also used in
cancer therapies. Hydroxychloroquine, a drug used in the
treatment of malaria appears to involve changes in
antigen presentation with effects on the innate immune
system and effective against RA. Medications with

Rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis

anti-TNF-a inhibitors [i.e. Etanercept (Enbrel†), Inflix-
imab (Remicade†), and Adalimumab (Humira†] are
currently used in the treatment of RA. The risks of side
effects are mainly related to secondary infections.

Anti-inflammatory treatment of periodontitis has also
been proposed. Data suggest that lipoxin (LXA4) antag-
onizes P. gingivalis-induced cell activation dependent on
leukocyte-platelet interaction through downregulation of
CD11b/CD18 (68, 69). Animal studies have shown a
protective role for lipoxin,
limiting PMN recruitment
and PMN-mediated tissue
in relation to
P. gingivalis-induced infection (70). Recent data suggest
that administration of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids plus low-dose aspirin as an adjunctive treatment to
regenerative periodontal therapy provides additional clin-
ical benefits (70). Studies have also shown that using an
adjunctive subantimicrobial-dose of doxycycline in peri-
odontal therapy suppresses proinflammatory cytokines
and regulate the inflammatory response to therapy (71).

Studies on the effects of treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis on periodontitis and the
effects of periodontal therapy on rheumatoid
arthritis conditions
There are several studies assessing the effects of RA
treatment on periodontal conditions as well as on the
impact of RA conditions following periodontal therapies.
The studies on RA treatment are related to DMARDs
whereas the periodontal intervention studies are based on
routine non-surgical periodontal debridement assessing
systemic effects. A summary of findings from select
studies is presented (Table 2).

Most studies on RA status as effects by non-surgical
routine periodontal therapy have used the American
Rheumatology College criteria from 1987 (51). It appears
that most study samples have been derived from clinics
providing care for RA subjects. History of DMARD or
other medication can be difficult to assess. Current
therapy, using DMARDs might have masked the impact
of RA on the development of periodontal. For example,
the extent of gingival inflammation and pseudo-pockets
may have been managed through DMARDS or other
anti-inflammatory agents used over longer periods of
time. It is also highly likely that extensive tooth extrac-
tions have been performed in RA subjects participating in
the reported intervention studies. For example,
the
NHANES III data reported by de Pablo et al. (57)
identified that 50% of RA subjects were edentulous.
Therefore, a large number of subjects with RA cannot be
assessed in relation to the association with periodontitis.
These edentulous subjects may represent severe cases with
periodontitis and RA. The fact that one study has
identified a high odds ratio for periodontitis and RA
should be carefully considered (59). It is important to
recognize that RA is not a highly prevalent disease

in different

Usually, the intervention studies have been performed
in subjects who use anti-inflammatory drugs for the
management of RA during the periodontal intervention.
Therefore, the additional effects of periodontal therapy to
reduce systemic inflammation may have been masked by
the efficacy of routine systemic medication to control for
inflammation (i.e. DMARDS). In one study, serum anti-
P. gingivalis titers were correlated with RA factor and
periodontal conditions, and treatment with DMARDS
improved periodontal conditions (66). This further sup-
ports the infectious relationship between periodontitis
and RA.

Two studies (70, 72) assessed the effects of anti-TNF-a
in the treatment of RA demonstrated that anti-TNF-a
therapy resulted in clinical benefits in regard to period-
ontal conditions. Presently, TNF-a therapy for the
treatment of periodontitis has only been assessed in
subjects with RA. Unpublished data through experiences
by the author of this review suggest that TNF-a therapy
in a patient with Morbus Crohn drastically improved
severe periodontal conditions. Anti-TNF-a therapy is,
however, also associated with serious adverse effects
(80, 81). At the present time, anti-TNF-a therapy or the
use of DMARDs in the sole management of periodontitis
cannot be advocated. Further information about the
impact of such medications could be important for the
current understanding and management of periodontitis.

Alternative medicine and nutrition in modulation
of inflammation in RA and periodontitis
that epigenetic changes
Accumulating data suggest
through the
regulation proinflammatory responses
through NFkB regulation affecting TNF-a may be
crucially involved in the pathology of RA and other
chronic inflammatory diseases (82). Data suggest that
oxidative stress is profound in RA and reactive oxygen
species play a causal role in RA. Medications used to
manage oxidant/antioxidant
imbalance may provide
alternatives in the treatment of RA (34, 83, 84). There
are merging data suggesting that dietary factors, such as
micronutrients and non-nutrient dietary components can
modify epigenetic marks (85). Thus, patients with RA
benefit from a diet rich in antioxidants, lactobacilli, and
fibers (86). In one pilot study, beneficial effects of an
antioxidant intervention on clinical parameters for RA
were identified (87). Recent data suggest that the admin-
istration of omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3 FA) reduces the
extent of swollen and tender joint in patients with active
RA (88). There is also emerging evidence that dietary
intake of polyphenols interferes with P. gingivalis, sug-
gesting that polyphenols in diet may be useful in the

management of periodontal disease (89). At this time,
there are no studies that specifically have addressed
the effects of polyphenols in patients with RA and
periodontitis.

Citrullination and heat chock proteins
P. gingivalis infection may through citrullination play a
significant role in RA. Although P. gingivalis hitherto is
the only bacterium that has been identified that expresses
endogenous citrullinated proteins, other factor may also
be associated with citrullination and through this
mechanism associated with RA (3640). Citrullinated
proteins can be found in keratin and filagrin in skin and,
i.e. oral mucosa. Citrullinated proteins are present in the
gingiva of patients with periodontitis (37). Such citrulli-
nated proteins are also involved in keratinocyte differ-
entiation. Physiological citrullination of myelin has been
linked to multiple sclerosis (90). Environmental and
genetic factors may induce autoimmunity to specific
citrullinated proteins (91).

The literature on the role of HSPs in autoimmune
disease and in periodontitis is extensive. HSPs linked to
P. gingivalis have hitherto not been considered in relation
to RA. HSP60 from P. gingivalis can trigger molecule
linking infectious periodontitis and autoimmune athero-
sclerosis (92). The progression of atherosclerosis can be
explained in terms of the immune response to bacterial
HSPs with bacterial HSPs are major antigenic determi-
nants during infection (93, 94). Current data also suggest
that HSPs are significant factors also in RA and related
to citrullination (95, 96).

Summary of review
There is historical evidence of a link between RA and
periodontitis. Although several studies have suggested an
association between RA and periodontitis well-controlled
large studies are needed to confirm these observations. As
for many other studies assessing the relationship between
periodontitis and diseases: i.e. diabetes mellitus, cardio-
vascular diseases, and adverse pregnancy outcomes,
studies have used different criteria for the definition of
periodontitis. Many studies have included few subjects.
Therefore, the lack of statistical power is of concern.
Most studies have included convenience cohorts and may
represent special populations with RA. Gender, age, and
smoking habits in subjects with RA and periodontitis are
other issues that are difficult to address in small samples.
This makes it almost impossible to compare and merge
study results and to draw firm conclusions.

Additional research both in regards to basic mecha-
nisms as well as clinical studies are needed before it can
be said that there are causative links between RA and
periodontitis. Nevertheless, some factors can be identi-
fied. In Fig. 1, factors that may be proven important for

1) Genetic factors are driving the host responses to
chronic diseases with a complex pathogenesis. Much
attention has been given to TNF-a, a proinflamma-
tory cytokine regulating a cascade of inflammatory
events in many disease including RA and period-
ontitis. Other diseases such as osteoporosis and
some cardiovascular diseases may share similar
genetic tracts to disease.
Infection has been identified as a primary etiology
for many diseases. The
abilities of
P. gingivalis as mentioned above through citrullina-
tion and the development of specific autoantibodies
may be a primary link between RA and period-
ontitis and explain not only the chronicity in RA but
also the chronicity of periodontitis. Whether other
oral bacteria associated with periodontitis are able
to induce citrullination has not yet been assessed. In
addition, P. gingivalis HSPs may trigger autoim-
mune responses.
