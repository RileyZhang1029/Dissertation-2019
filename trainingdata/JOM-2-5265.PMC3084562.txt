The safety committee of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) recommended in 2009 that
clinicians should consider antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients with total joint replacement before any
invasive procedure that may cause bacteremia. This has aroused confusion and anger among dentists asking
for the evidence. The present review deals with different aspects of the rationale for this recommendation
giving attention to views both in favor of and against it.

It has been estimated that by 2030 almost four million

primary total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthro-
plasty procedures will be carried out annually in the
USA (1). Prosthetic joint infection is a rare, but well-
recognized complication of these procedures, causing
significant morbidity and mortality (2, 3). Deep infection
has the potential to become the most frequent failure
mode for total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthro-
plasty in the USA within the next two or three decades
(4). The financial cost of each infection episode is 34
times the cost of a primary joint arthroplasty, usually
exceeding US$50,000 (5). Whether dental procedures
increase the risk for infection of joint prostheses through
bacteremia has been debated for almost 30 years (6), the
controversy has never been solved (7). The American
Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the
American Dental Association (ADA) recognized the
confusion around this problem and established expert
panels in 1997 and 2003. The panels recommended that
routine antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures in
patients with a prosthetic joint should not be adminis-
tered, and that it should be considered only in selected
patients with total joint arthroplasty who undergo high-
risk dental procedures (8, 9). Recently, however, the safety
committee of the AAOS gave new information on its web
site, recommending that clinicians should consider anti-
biotic prophylaxis
joint
replacement before any invasive procedure that may
cause bacteremia (10). This recommendation has aroused

for all patients with total

confusion and anger among dentists asking for the
evidence (11), and it has been characterized as irrespon-
sible and indefensible (12). Uc¸kay et al. (13) reviewing the
literature, found that the requirement for antimicrobial
prophylaxis before dental treatment in patients with
artificial
joints lacks evidence-based information and
cannot be universally recommended. The present review
will deal with different aspects of the rationale for this
recommendation, trying to give attention to views both in
favor of and against it. Data were collected from a
PubMed research focusing on the most recent publica-
tions in the field using different key words.

Stages of infected implants
Orthopedic implant infections are generally classified as
early, delayed or late (14). The micro-organisms asso-
ciated with these different stages are given in Table 1.
Early infections are mainly presumed to be the result
of
the surgical site
and are frequently caused by higher grade pathogens
such as Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-
resistant strains. Beta-hemolytic streptococci and anae-
robic Gram-negative rods can also be detected. Delayed
infections, however, are more often caused by coagulase-
negative staphylococci (CNS) and other skin commen-
sals. These infections can also be caused by intraoperative
contamination or by hematogenous spread. Clinical
symptoms here are pain and swelling. Late infections
appear more than 12 months postoperatively and are

have chronically infected the prosthesis since implanta-
tion. Importantly, they also include cases of hematogen-
ous seeding with organisms causing bacteremia.

Oral species most frequently associated with
hip joint infection
The most frequently detected organisms in joint infec-
tions as such are staphylococci. According to Geipel (15),
S. aureus dominates in acute purulent arthritis while CNS
are found mainly in periprosthetic infections and after
diagnostic arthroscopies. Antibiotic-resistant staphylo-
cocci may occasionally compromise the treatment out-
come of prosthetic joint infections (16). Most authors
think that staphylococci are not common parts of the
oral microbiota and that the oral cavity therefore plays
no major role in total hip joint infections. However,
according to Smith et al. (17), making a comprehensive
review, staphylococci can frequently be found in the oral
cavity, and this site may serve as a potential reservoir for
transmission to other body sites (18). According to these
authors, oral species such as staphylococci and strepto-
cocci are most
frequently associated with prosthetic
hip or knee joint infection. In a recent study from the
Mayo Clinic (6), beta-hemolytic streptococci, Peptostrep-
tococcus species, Actinomyces species, viridans group
streptococci, Abiotrophia/Granulicatella
and
Gemella species from 339 cases with prosthetic hip or
knee joint infection isolated in 20012006 were consid-
ered as potential oral or dental organisms for such
infection. They constituted 35 (10.3%) of the prosthetic
hip or knee infections. However, S. aureus and CNS, that
comprised 58% of the isolates, were not listed as potential
oral pathogens. LaPorte et al. (19) reviewed the records of
2,973 patients with total hip arthroplasty. Of the late
infections in 52 patients,

and
Peptostreptococcus from one. The authors suggested
that infection of a total hip arthroplasty after dental
procedures is more common than previously thought and
that patients with systemic disease, or who are under-
going extensive dental procedures, should be considered
for antibiotic treatment. Maderazo et al. (20), reviewing
67 infections developing more than 1 year after arthro-
plasty, found that the most common site of origin for the
infectious agents was the skin and soft tissues (46%),
followed by the mouth (15%) and the urinary tract (13%).
The most common pathogens responsible for late pros-
thetic joint infections were staphylococci (54%), both
S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, even when the
infection was of dental origin. Generally, anaerobes such
as Bacteroides fragilis are rarely found and usually as
parts of a polymicrobial infection (15). The importance
of oral anaerobes in prosthetic joint infections is therefore
unclear.

To what extent do we find staphylococci in the
oral cavity?
There is considerable controversy as to whether Staphy-
lococcus species play a role in the ecology of the normal
oral flora, and there is surprisingly little knowledge on
the role of staphylococci in oral health and disease. It
has been claimed that S. aureus and S. epidermidis
constitute only 0.005% of
the oral microbiota (21).
However, a growing body of evidence suggests that
staphylococci can be isolated more frequently from the
oral cavity of some patient groups such as children (22),
elderly (23),
terminally ill patients (24), rheumatoid
arthritis patients (25), and patients with hematological
malignancies (26). Therefore, the oral cavity may repre-
sent a hitherto poorly recognized reservoir of staphylo-
cocci, which under the right conditions may cause local
or systemic infection (17).

Contributing to additional insight into the oral cavity
as a reservoir for staphylococci, a Japanese study among
56 systemically and periodontally healthy adults 2243
years of age, recovered nine different Staphylococcus
species (27); 334 isolates were found in saliva and
supragingival plaque. Staphylococci have also been
reported from periodontitis (2830). Murdoch et al.
(31) isolated staphylococci from 54% of diseased sub-
gingival and 43% of healthy subgingival sites in over 50%
of periodontitis patients (n28) and from 29% of healthy
subgingival sites in 54% controls (n28). Rams et al. (32)
found subgingival staphylococci in approximately 50% of
gingivitis and periodontitis patients. After
systemic
doxycycline therapy of 21 adult periodontitis patients,
more than a 10-fold increase was observed in subgingival
numbers of Enterobacter aerogenes
(two patients),

(one patient), Candida albicans (82

Significantly higher proportions of staphylococci were
recovered from periimplantitis lesions (15.1%) compared
to gingivitis (0.06%) and periodontitis (1.2%), and it was
suggested that staphylococci may play a role in some
failing osseointegrated dental
implants (32). Another
study with 37 patients with failing implants detected
staphylococci, organisms associated with the gut (Enter-
ococcus faecalis, E. aerogenes, Klebsiella species, E. coli)
and Candida species in 55% of peri-implant lesions and
almost as frequently as periodontopathogens (34). Im-
plants surrounded by healthy periodontium (n51) had
a microflora compatible with microbial health.

Increased carriage rates of S. aureus/staphylococci have
been demonstrated in denture-wearing patients, and
denture-induced stomatitis was associated with increased
amounts of staphylococci
in the saliva and the oral
mucosa (3537). From angular cheilitis of 64 patients, S.
aureus was isolated at a rate of 62.5% (38). Daniluk et al.
(39) detected Staphylococcus species far more frequently

diabetics

(pB0.05), and they were

Staphylococci have also been isolated from period-
ontitis in diabetic patients (29) and from acute period-
ontal abscesses in immunocompromised patients (40).
Also, patients with rheumatoid arthritis and xerostomia
receiving long-term immunosuppressive treatment had
large amounts of S. aureus on tongue and in oropharynx
(25, 41).

Staphylococci have been reported as the sole isolate
from aseptically opened infected root canals (42). The
authors argued that the possibility of oral staphylococci
causing acute exacerbations of root canal infections or
bacteremias should not be overlooked. In support of this
statement, staphylococci were recovered from intraoral
acute infections (18, 43, 44). They were amongst the most
common bacteria isolated from head and neck space
infections of odontogenic origin (45).
In addition,
patients with odontogenic infections resulting in swelling
of the face/throat demanding extraoral drainage, yielded
S. aureus and CNS in a polymicrobial environment (46).
S. aureus has further been recovered from jaw cysts (47)

and oral mucosal lesions (34).

Elderly healthy persons (]70 years) had a higher
frequency of staphylococci in saliva than younger persons
(48). This suggested age-related changes in the oral
microflora particularly after the age of 70. Elderly
persons in institutions also had significantly more oral
staphylococci than persons of the same age living in their
own homes (49).

Hip joint prosthesis and dental treatment/antibiotic prophylaxis

In addition, staphylococci/micrococci were present in
the dental operation area constituting 15.7% of the total
bacterial isolates (50). Staphylococci together with strep-
tococci were the most common organisms in rooms with
restorative dentistry (51).

From a regional diagnostic oral microbiologic labora-
tory, a hand search of laboratory records from 5,005
specimens during 19982000 revealed S. aureus in 1,017
specimens, of which 5% contained isolates resistant to
methicillin (18).

In contrast to the reports above, there is a general view
that staphylococci, particularly CNS are not usually
found in the oral cavity (Morris and Howie (12),
Blomgren et al. (52, 53)).

What Staphylococcus species are most
frequently reported from the oral cavity?
S. epidermidis and S. aureus are most frequently reported
in oral samples. In addition, Staphylococcus haemolyticus,
Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphy-
lococcus capitis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylo-
coccus xylosus, and Staphylococcus simulans have been
isolated (28, 32).

Interpretation problems
Most studies used selective agar to culture S. aureus from
clinical specimens. Very few authors reported the actual
numbers (cfu/ml) of staphylococci
isolated and few
longitudinal studies have been performed. This often
makes it difficult to determine whether the staphylococci
isolated have a role in the disease or belong to the
transient microflora (17). The high virulence of S. aureus
may involve a low threshold for causing disease, particu-
larly in compromised patients. An oral disease where
S. aureus clearly has been incriminated is a severe form of
mucositis in patients with orofacial granulomatosis and
Crohn’s disease (54) and in elderly dehydrated patients
(23) where treatment with anti-staphylococcal agents led
to a marked clinical improvement.

Can staphylococci and other oral bacteria reach
hip joints?
The frequency of bacteremia after dental procedures is
high (55). Guntheroth (56) found that transient bacter-
emia also occurs in up to 51% of individuals following
routine daily activities such as chewing and in up to 50%
after tooth brushing or oral irrigation. Dental flossing
can cause bacteremia in periodontally healthy and
periodontally diseased persons at a rate comparable
with that caused by some dental treatments for which
antibiotic prophylaxis is given to prevent
infectious
endocarditis (57). A number of different bacterial species
from the mouth have been detected in bacteremias after a
single tooth extraction (58) and transient bacteremia
after dental procedures has been suggested to be the

source of infection in total joint arthroplasties. Uc¸kay
et al. (13) conducted a PubMed search of the literature to
identify articles in the English, French, and German
language before 1 July 2007. They retrieved 144 articles
and found that many cases had been suggested where
infection of a joint replacement had an oral origin, but
efforts to record genetically identical strains in the mouth
and joints had not been made. LaPorte et al. (19)
reported that a review of the literature had identified
more than 30 cases of late infection in arthroplasties in
which bacteria might have originated from the oral cavity,
although in many cases there was no clear proof for this.
Interestingly, Bartzokas et al. (59) found that Strepto-
coccus sanguinis strains from the mouth were indistin-
guishable from those on infected prostheses in four
patients assessed by antibiograms and cell wall polypep-
tides. Jacobsen and Murray (60) reviewed 33 cases of
infected hips out of 1,855 hip prosthesis replacements and
found that the risk of infection associated with dental
procedures was extremely low (0.05%). S. aureus was the
most frequently isolated organism from infected hips and
its incidence was twice as high in the late (6 months
after replacement) as in the early (B6 months after
replacements) infections. In a literature review of 23 cases
of late prosthetic joint infection where the source of
infection was suggested to be the oral cavity due to
treatment or infection, 10 cases (43%) were caused by
Staphylococcus species, the most common being S. aureus
(eight cases) (61). According to Deacon et al. (62), S.
epidermidis has been implicated in 7% of infections
related to a dental procedure, but the evidence linking
late infections around a prosthetic joint to a specific
dental procedure is ambiguous at best. Berbari et al. (6)
argued that reported prosthetic joint infections are more
likely to be caused by bacteremia related to routine daily
activities than to bacteremia caused by dental procedures.
This emphasizes the importance of maintaining good
oral hygiene and eradication of oral disease to prevent
bacteremia. Bacteremias probably have greater clinical
significance in the immunocompromised patient than in
the healthy subject (17). It is well known that anti-cancer
drugs are cytotoxic and may cause ulceration of the oral
mucosa as a side effect. This ulceration may be an
entrance point for oral bacteria so that they can reach
the blood circulation. In a 15-year old bone marrow
transplant patient, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus oralis
were cultured from the blood stream (63). Pulsed field gel
electrophoresis of SmaI chromosomal DNA digests
indicated that the mouth was the source of both isolates
while the site of venous access was negative, but it was
responsible for subsequent episodes of staphylococcal
bacteremia.

After insertion of a hip joint prosthesis, part of the
synovial membrane may be retained. Interestingly, syno-
vial
inflammation in active rheumatoid arthritis and

psoriatic arthritis was suggested to facilitate trapping of
a variety of DNAs from oral bacteria (64, 65). Although
staphylococci were not examined, these studies suggested
that DNA from oral bacteria can reach joints and that
there can be a perpetuating effect of oral pathogens in
joint disease. In a report by Fe Marque´s et al. (66), septic
arthritis of the knee occurred due to Prevotella loeschei 48
h after tooth extraction. Presence of an active antibody
response in synovial tissue also illustrated a potential
connection between periodontal and joint diseases (67).
Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis had a higher
prevalence of S. aureus in the oral cavity compared to
gender-matched controls (25). A significantly higher
portion (56%) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis
carried oral S. aureus than controls (24%) (pB0.05)
(17). Many rheumatoid arthritis patients have dry mouth
resulting in a significant change in the oral microflora as
seen in Sjo¨gren’s syndrome (68), and are often subjected
to immunosuppressive or cytotoxic treatment. Over the
last decade, a number of publications have demonstrated
that throat carriage of S. aureus is quite common. A
significant number of persons carrying S. aureus in the
nose are also throat carriers. In fact, some papers report
throat carriage to be more frequent than nasal carriage
(6971).

Can methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) occur in the oral cavity?
According to Small et al. (72), the oral cavity can be an
overlooked site for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA). This may have implications for how to
treat an orally induced joint infection. Among children
(05 years) attending a pediatric department, 84% carried
Staphylococcus species; 6% of S. aureus were MRSA (22).
Acute parotitis caused by MRSA has been reported in
elderly patients (73, 74). Dentures may carry MRSA (37,
7578). Staphylococci colonizing the oral cavity may
serve as a potential reservoir for transmission of MRSA
to other body sites, possibly hip joints, or cause cross-
infection in other patients or health care workers.

Recommending antimicrobial prophylaxis
Of total knee joint replacements in 3,490 patients treated
between 1982 and 1993, 0.2% resulted in infection that
was considered strongly associated with dental proce-
dures (79). Five of the nine patients with infections
related to dental procedures had systemic risk factors
that predisposed to infection. The authors held that
patients with a total knee arthroplasty, undergoing
extensive dental procedures, who have systemic disease
that compromises host defense, should receive a prophy-
lactic antibiotic. According to Geipel (15), antibiotic
prophylaxis during dental procedures are useful in order
to prevent late-onset prosthetic infection. LaPorte et al.
(19) suggested that infection of a total hip arthroplasty

it

increased risk of hematogenous total

after dental procedures is more common than previously
suspected and that patients with systemic disease, or who
are undergoing extensive dental procedures, should be
considered for antibiotic treatment. Jaspers and Little
(80) recommended that dental practitioners who treat
patients with arthroplasty should consult with and
follow the recommendations of the orthopedic surgeon
regarding antibiotic prophylaxis. As mentioned pre-
viously, the AAOS 2009 statement (10) recommends
antibiotic prophylaxis before any invasive procedure that
may produce bacteremia regardless of the length of time
after the total
joint replacement surgery. The ADA/
AAOS recommendation from 2003 (9) concluded that
antibiotic prophylaxis is neither indicated for dental
patients with pins, plates or screws, nor that
is
routinely indicated for most dental patients with total
joint replacements. Prophylaxis should only be consid-
ered in the small number of patients who may be at
potential
joint
infection. Friedlander (81) emphasized that the oral
microbiota is more diverse than previously thought
and that it is altered by age and related changes in
immune competence, gender, underlying illness, medica-
tion, salivary flow, and wearing of dental prostheses. It
therefore logically follows that invasive dental proce-
dures may cause both Staphylococcus and Streptococcus
bacteremias which have been implicated in late joint
infections. According to this author the claim that
S. aureus and S. epidermidis make up only 0.005% of
the oral flora is an underestimation of staphylococci in
the oral cavity of individuals without and with dental
infection, and it also underestimates the significant role
of streptococci in late infections of total joint prosthesis.
Also, Wijngaarden and Kruize (82) recommended anti-
biotic prophylaxis, particularly for patients with risk
factors such as rheumatoid arthritis and hemophilia.
The reported incidence of late infections after dental
procedures may be underestimated by the high rate of
antibiotic prescription in the past and the difficulty in
establishing the origin of late infection. Podbielski et al.
(83)
the causality of professional dental
procedures for prosthesis infections has never been
conclusively demonstrated, e.g. by molecular methods.
However,
the association remains plausible and the
consequences for the patients are severe. Patients with
systemic disease or those undergoing intensive proce-
dures should be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis
(19). According to these authors, infection of a total hip
arthroplasty after dental procedures is more common
than previously suggested. Interestingly, a healthy man
having undergone revision hip arthroplasty 11 months
previously developed acute signs of infection of the hip
prosthesis with an oral organism 30 h after non-invasive
supragingival dental cleaning performed without anti-
biotic (84). Antibiotic prophylaxis during dental proce-

dures or genitourinary tract and gastrointestinal tract
interventions are useful to prevent late-onset prosthetic
infection (85). Norden (86) advocated that for routine
dental work on most patients with total joint replace-
ment there is insufficient evidence to support antibiotic
prophylaxis. However, for individuals with periodontal
disease or potential dental
infection, antimicrobial
prophylaxis seems indicated. Maderazo et al. (20) argued
that mortality and cost calculations indicate that che-
moprophylaxis is justified for dental procedures and
probably also for other surgical procedures in organs
containing microflora. Toma´s et al. (87) recommended
routine use of an 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash before
dental extractions to reduce the risk of postextraction
bacteremia. Also, oral health care may have beneficial
effects on the oropharyngeal microflora. Thus, the total
levels of oropharyngeal organisms such as streptococci,
staphylococci, Candia, Pseudomonas, and black-pigmen-
ted Bacteroides decreased or disappeared after weekly
professional oral health care (88).

Rejecting antibiotic prophylaxis
There are more authors rejecting antibiotic prophylaxis
before dental treatment of patients with hip prosthesis
than those recommending it. A recent note by Morris and
Howie (12) called recommendations for antibiotics in
patients with joint prosthesis irresponsible and indefen-
sible. They claimed that the organisms most responsible
for both early and late prosthetic joint infection are S.
aureus and CNS, both uncommonly found in the oral
cavity. Since only 0.050.2% of
late prosthetic joint
infections are related to dental procedures, dentists by
prescribing antibiotics may confer more harm than
benefit to their patients (13). In an editorial, Assael (89)
held that only a small proportion of bacteremias from an
oral source are associated with dental treatment and that
it would not be reasonable to recommend that millions of
patients be medicated at enormous costs depending upon
a few case reports. van der Bruggen and Mudrikova (90)
argued against antibiotic prophylaxis because rando-
mized placebo-controlled trials supporting this is lacking,
and Bauer et al. (91) maintained that antibiotic therapy is
not indicated for routine dental care in the majority of
patients but is recommended whenever there is a high risk
of arthroplasty contamination. They also claimed that
the most important objective is to obtain and maintain a
good state of oral hygiene to prevent bacteremia. Lock-
hart et al. (21) selected eight groups of patients with
specific medical conditions and devices who often are
given antibiotic prophylaxis before undergoing dental
procedures: natural heart valves, prosthetic heart valves,
pacemakers, renal dialysis and cerebrospinal fluid shunts,
and hip, knee, and shoulder prosthetic joints. They
searched the literature from 1966 through 2005 and
found little or no evidence for the use of antibiotics

before dental procedures for these eight groups of
patients. In an invited commentary for Special Care
Dentistry, Marek and Ernst (11) argued against the recent
recommendation of AAOS that healthcare providers
should consider antibiotic prophylaxis prior to any
invasive procedure performed on all patients with total
knee or hip replacements, regardless of the age of the
joint arthroplasty or the patient’s medical history, asking
for the evidence. Napen˜ as et al. (92) pointed out that the
new statement by AAOS from 2009 has not been
developed collaboratively with the ADA, as was the
case in the previous statement of 1997 and revision in
2003. The 2003 statement limited the use of prophylaxis
to the first 2 years following joint replacement surgery
and patients with comorbidities that might
involve
increased risk of bacteremia, e.g. immunocompromised
patients, for more than 2 years after surgery (Table 2).
The reason for the 2009 recommendation was potential
adverse outcomes and cost of treating an infected joint
replacement. Jenny (93) found it questionable if prophy-
lactic antibiotic treatment can be advocated based only
on a high incidence of
late infections in total hip
arthroplasty associated with dental procedures since the
frequency among all
infected total hip arthroplasties
varies in the literature from 0.04% to 6%. One reason for
this variation could be differences in dental status. In an
editorial, Sandhu et al. (94) maintained that prophylactic
antibiotics should not be administered because there is no
scientific evidence supporting their use. According to
Abraham-Inpijn (95), the risk associated with antibiotic
prophylaxis is greater than the risk of having a joint
infection. There is no evidence that links prosthetic joint
infections to dental procedures and none to prove that
antibiotic prophylaxis is effective (96). Seymour et al. (97)
thought that the case for providing antibiotic prophylaxis
prior to dental
treatment of patients with a joint
prosthesis is weak or virtually non-existing. They also
held that the risk associated with prophylaxis is greater
than the risk of joint infection. Pallasch and Slots (7)
citing McGowan and Hendrey (98), expressed that the
fear of a tragic complication following a proportionately
trivial procedure is not
in itself a justification for
irrational and excessive prophylactic therapy. They also
advocated that linking a prosthetic joint infection to a
single event such as dental treatment occurring amid
months of random cases of bacteremia and invasive
events associated with daily living remains impossible.
Several
studies have indicated that prosthetic joint
infections of oral microbial origin have a possible
prevalence rate of 0.030.04% (7), yet not a single reliable
case-control, cohort, retrospective or prospective study
has documented such a relationship and no studies have
ever been performed to test the proper drug, dose, and
dosing interval (7).

What antibiotic prophylaxis should be chosen to
prevent staphylococcal joint infection?
According to Geipel (15), perioperative antibiotic pro-
phylaxis clearly demonstrates reduction of the infection
rate after joint surgery. Important is the application time
before operation, about 3060 min before incision.
Cefalosporins of the first or second generation are most
widely used in orthopedic surgery. Alternatives in patients
with beta-lactam allergy are clindamycin or vancomycin.
In hospitals with high prevalence of MRSA, vancomycin
is preferred. As staphylococci sometimes are resistant to
beta-lactam antibiotics, Friedlander (81) recommended 2
g of amoxicillin clavulanate or 600 mg of clindamycin by
mouth 1 h before dental
treatment. This is quite
consistent with the German Society for Orthopedics
and Traumatology Prophylaxis recommendations (83).
The antibiotic prophylactic regimen suggested by ADA/
AAOS (9) is given in Table 3. For intravenous use,
Friedlander (95) recommended clindamycin 600 mg
usually 30 min before the procedure. According to
Mechan et al. (99), the cefalosporins (cefazolin and
cefuroxime) have been the preferred antimicrobials with
proven success for prophylaxis in hip and knee arthro-
plasty. However, the rate of S. aureus resistance to
cefazolin was 50% and the rate of S. epidermidis
resistance to cefazolin was 70% for all sources of
infection at their working place. The authors therefore
added preoperative vancomycin along with cefazolin as
prophylaxis against these resistant organisms and the
other common bacterial causes of infection in joint
replacement.

How effective is antibiotic prophylaxis related to
dental procedures to prevent prosthetic hip
infections?
Data (19872001)
from the Norwegian Arthroplasty
Register on the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis systemi-
cally and in bone cement, on the revision rate of 22,170
primary hip replacements, showed that the best results
were achieved when antibiotic prophylaxis was given
both systemically and in the bone cement, and if the
systemic antibiotic was given four times on the day of
surgery (100). However, according to Berbari et al. (6)
there have been no well-designed, case-control or cohort
studies linking definitely any type of dental procedure
with an increased risk of prosthetic joint infection. In an
attempt to define the actual risk of prosthetic joint
infection and the role of antibiotic prophylaxis, these
authors carried out a single-center, case-control study on
339 case patients and 339 control subjects for the period
20012006. There was no increased risk of prosthetic hip
or knee infection in patients undergoing high-risk or
low-risk dental procedures who were not given antibiotic
prophylaxis compared to the risk for patients not
undergoing a dental procedure. Antibiotic prophylaxis

decrease the risk of subsequent

infection. The authors admitted that a small increase
in prosthetic joint infection following dental procedures
might have been undetected because the number of

patients and control subjects needed to reveal
this
would have to be extremely high and not feasible in a
single-center study. Deacon et al. (62) reported five cases
of late prosthetic joint infection associated with dental
treatment despite antibiotic prophylaxis. A similar find-

systemic

ing was reported by Skiest and Coykendall (101) using
erythromycin in a patient treated with corticosteroids
for
erythematosus. This demons-
trated that antibiotic prophylaxis is not always effective.
Accordingly, antibiotic prophylaxis for high-risk patients
has been recommended by
authors but
this contention has not been substantiated by clinical
evidence (7).

Side effects of antibiotic prophylaxis
It has been estimated that routine prophylaxis with oral
penicillin in one million hypothetical patients with total
joint arthroplasty undergoing dental treatment would
result in 400 cases of anaphylaxis (102). This suggests that
the risk-benefit ratio for beta-lactam prophylactic anti-
biotics may not be favorable (7). Antibiotic use may also
be associated with risks such as toxicity, superinfection,
selection of antibiotic resistance, pseudomembranous
colitis, cross-reactions with other drugs and death (103,
104).

Concluding remarks
Most authors hold that staphylococci, particularly CNS
do not usually occur in the oral cavity and accordingly,
the organisms dominating in infections of joint pros-
theses are not of oral origin. Other authors think that
staphylococci are more prevalent in the oral cavity than
previously believed and there are many reports support-
ing this. These organisms may colonize the oral cavity
both in healthy and diseased sites. Particularly elderly
with underlying systemic disease seem to be susceptible.
Also, MRSA occasionally occur in the oral cavity.
Knowledge of
the real prevalence and ecology of
staphylococci in the oral microbiota is hampered by the
fact that samples, which usually have been recovered from
the saliva or mucosa, have been cultivated on selective
media making it difficult to determine their real part of
the total microflora. Furthermore, proof of the source of
infection would require the organism to be cultured from
the mouth, blood, and infected joint simultaneously and
analyzed by molecular microbiological methods for
comparison. There is a possibility that oral staphylococci
can reach the blood stream, causing infection in distant
sites, but the evidence that this should be a frequent event
is not available. This does not exclude that such spread
may occur, and the consequences could be dramatic for
the patient with joint prosthesis. A number of DNAs
from oral bacteria have been detected in joints of
rheumatoid and psoriatic patients possibly trapped there
by synovial inflammation. Therefore, the importance in
joint infection of oral organisms other than staphylococci
should not be overlooked. Daily procedures such as tooth
brushing or chewing can cause bacteremia. This could be
more important to the health of implanted joints than
dental procedures. An optimal dental hygiene and regular

dental visits are more important than antibiotic prophy-
laxis in maintaining joint health. This is important to
realize because the efficiency of antibiotic prophylaxis
against joint infection has not been convincingly proved.
Under any circumstance the rare occurrence of late joint
infections would not justify antibiotic prophylaxis on a
regular basis. Unfortunately, the AAOS recommendation
from 2009 has created much confusion on this point
among dentists. Many think that the previous ADA/
AAOS recommendation stating that it is advisable to
consider premedication for only a small number of
patients who may be at potential risk for experiencing
hematogenous total joint infection is more acceptable.
Others totally reject antibiotic prophylaxis in otherwise
healthy patients with joint prosthesis. Disregarding the
last recommendation from AAOS, which many dentists
feel is not at all based on scientific evidence, may bring
them into a medicallegal problem if joint infection
occurs. It would appear that the ADA should give some
help here by guiding dentists in relation to the latest
AAOS recommendation. However, as long as ADA has
not given any comments related to this, it would appear
reasonable for dentists to follow the guidelines for the use
of hip joint prophylaxis as given in 2003 in the joint
ADA/AAOS recommendation.

Conflict of interest and funding
There is no conflict of interest in the present study for the
authors.
