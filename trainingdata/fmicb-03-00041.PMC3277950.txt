The role of phytochelatins (PCn, metal-binding oligopeptides with the general structure
(γGlu-Cys)n-Gly (n = 2–11) in metal detoxiﬁcation is assumed to be based on immobilization
of metals, which prevents binding of metals to important biomolecules. Although induc-
tion of phytochelatin synthesis has often been observed in algae upon exposure to metals,
direct evidence for binding of the inducing metal to phytochelatins is scarce. In this study,
a nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nano-ESI-MS) method is developed for
identiﬁcation and characterization of Pb(II)–PCn and Zn(II)–PCn complexes. Complexes of
Pb(II) with standard PCn (n = 2–4; 0.25 mM Pb(II) and 0.5 mM PCn) were examined by nano-
ESI-MS with respect to their stoichiometry. Pb–PCn mass spectra indicated the presence
of the [M+ H]+ peak of PCn and complexes with various stoichiometries. Analysis of Pb–
PC2 allowed the identiﬁcation of four different complexes observed at m/z 746.10, 952.06,
1285.24, and 1491.20, corresponding to [Pb–PC2]+, [Pb2–PC2]+, [Pb–(PC2)2]+, and [Pb2–
(PC2)2]+. Their m/z indicated coordination of Pb(II) by PC2 through the thiol groups of PC
cysteine and possibly carboxylic groups. For each of the standard PC3 and PC4, two differ-
ent complexes were observed, corresponding to Pb–PC3, Pb2–PC3, Pb–PC4, and Pb2–PC4.
The measured isotopic patterns were for all complexes identical to the theoretical isotopic
patterns. Addition of Zn(II) (0.125–5 mM) to previously formed Pb–PC2 complexes showed
the appearance of the [Zn–PC2]+ complexes at m/z 602.05 and the decrease of the [Pb–
PC2]+ peak. These ﬁndings corroborate the postulated Pb–PC complexes from a previous
study using size exclusion chromatography of PC extracted from algae, as well as the
concurrent formation of Pb–, Zn–, and Cu–PC complexes in algae.

INTRODUCTION
Phytochelatins (PCs) are known to be induced in response to expo-
sure to various metals in plants (Rauser, 1995; Zenk, 1996) and
algae (Gekeler et al., 1988; Ahner et al., 1995; Le Faucheur et al.,
2005; Scheidegger et al., 2011a). These metal-binding oligopep-

tides with the general structure (γ-Glu-Cys)n-Gly (n = 2–11) are

assumed to bind metals through thiolate coordination and are
involved in metal homeostasis and detoxiﬁcation. The role of PCs
in metal detoxiﬁcation likely results from immobilization of met-
als, preventing non-speciﬁc binding to important biomolecules,
followed by the transport of the Me–PC complexes into the vac-
uole of the algal cell, or its excretion. In our previous studies,
induction of phytochelatins by exposure of Chlamydomonas rein-
hardtii to Pb(II) has been observed (Scheidegger et al., 2011a).
Binding of Pb(II) to phytochelatins has been postulated based on
separation of metal complexes from C. reinhardtii by size exclusion
chromatography (SEC; Scheidegger et al., 2011b). However, direct
evidence for binding of the inducing metal to phytochelatins is
scarce. It is therefore of interest to attempt to directly characterize
metal–phytochelatin complexes.

absorption spectrometry (AAS), radio-active labeling, differential
pulse polarography, and inductively coupled plasma mass spec-
trometry (ICP-MS) have been used to analyze PCn and metal–
phytochelatin complexes (Me–PC; Grill et al., 1985; Maitani et al.,
1996; Leopold and Günther, 1997; Leopold et al., 1999; Vacchina
et al., 1999, 2000; Schmoger et al., 2000; Scarano and Morelli, 2002;
Cruz et al., 2005; Kobayashi and Yoshimura, 2006). These methods,
however, do not provide exact molecular weight, stoichiometry, or
composition of Me–PCn complexes. In most in vivo studies focus-
ing on Me–PC complex characterization, Me–PC complexes were
isolated by gel ﬁltration and the resulting eluate fractions were
further analyzed for PC and metal content. PC detection often
involves acidiﬁcation and derivatization, which lead to dissocia-
tion of the Me–PC complexes, followed by HPLC analysis. Based
on the detected molecular weight range obtained from gel ﬁltra-
tion and the PC oligomers detected by HPLC, assumptions on
stoichiometry and composition of the Me–PC complexes can be
made; however, unambiguous characterization of Me–PC com-
plexes regarding stoichiometry and composition is not possible
with these methods.

Several analytical methods such as chromatographic separation
(gel ﬁltration or HPLC) coupled with UV detection, ﬂame atomic

A technique to precisely detect and characterize the Me–PCn
complexes is thus required. Several studies reported identiﬁcation

of Cd–PC, Zn–PC, and As(III)–PC complexes using electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS; Yen et al., 1999; Raab
et al., 2005; Navaza et al., 2006; Chekmeneva et al., 2007; Chen
et al., 2007; Bluemlein et al., 2008, 2009), but analysis of Me–PC
complexes formed with lead has not been reported.

In our previous study, induction of PC2–PC4 synthesis by
Pb(II) was observed in the green alga C. reinhardtii (Scheideg-
ger et al., 2011a). Furthermore, formation of PCn complexes with
Cu, Zn, and Pb, and possible stoichiometric compositions of Pb–
PC complexes were postulated based on the molecular weight
obtained from SEC (Scheidegger et al., 2011b). Therefore, the aim
of the present study is to develop an ESI-MS method to iden-
tify and characterize Me–PCn complexes formed with Pb and to
examine the competition with Cu and Zn. Sample composition
and ESI-MS conditions to analyze Pb complexes with standard
phytochelatins (n = 2–4) are optimized. The stoichiometry of the
Pb–PC2–4 complexes is derived.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CHEMICALS
Pb(NO3)2, CuSO4, and ZnSO4
salts, ammonium acetate
(NH4CH3COO), ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3; pH 7),
polylysine, and 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) used
in this study were analytical grade and obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Phytochelatin standards (PC2,
PC3, and PC4) were obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA,
USA). Formic acid was a suprapure chemical obtained from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany). Ultrafree-MC centrifugal ﬁlters (0.45 μm
cut-off) were ordered from Millipore AG (Zug, Switzerland).

SAMPLE PREPARATION
In preliminary experiments the solvent mixture for the analysis of
Pb–PC complexes was optimized. The following sample composi-
tion resulted in the highest signal intensities in nano-electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (nano-ESI-MS) analysis. The ratio
of PCn to Pb was in the range observed in algal cells (Scheidegger
et al., 2011a,b). PCn and Pb were mixed, resulting in ﬁnal con-
centrations of 0.5 mM PCn and 0.25 mM Pb(NO3)2 in 100 mM
NH4CH3COO and 50 mM (NH4)2CO3. Complex formation was
allowed for 15 min at room temperature. Prior to sample analysis
0.1% formic acid was added (pH 6), followed by sample ﬁltration
using an Ultrafree-MC centrifugal ﬁlter device with a 0.45-μm
cut-off.

For competition experiments between Cu or Zn and Pb, stan-
dard Pb–PC2 complexes were prepared as described and complex
formation was allowed, followed by the addition of the Cu or Zn
solution. Cu and Zn concentrations added to the Pb–PC2 com-
plexes were 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 5 mM. Acidiﬁcation was done by
addition of 0.1% formic acid. The ratios of Cu and Zn to Pb in the
competition experiments were in the range Cu (or Zn): Pb= 0.5–
20, and would thus simulate a similar or higher concentration of
Cu and Zn than Pb, which may be representative for algal cells.

Mass spectra were acquired and analyzed using the software
Xcalibur V2.0.7 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, San Jose, CA, USA).
The isotopic distributions for the positively charged molecular
ions of Me–PC complexes were generated with the spectrum
simulation software integrated in Xcalibur.

NANO-ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETRY ANALYSIS
OF ME–PC COMPLEXES
Solvent mixture optimization for nano-ESI-MS analysis of Pb–

PCn (n = 2–4) were carried out on a API4000 triple quadrupole

mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland)
with attached nanospray source (Sciex, NanoSpray® III Source,
Zug, Switzerland).

Final analysis of Pb–PCn complexes was carried out on a LTQ
Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, San
Jose, CA, USA). Capillaries for nano-ESI were prepared from
coated fused silica tubing (TSP-FS; o.d. 375 μm; i.d. 100 μm; BGB,
USA) using a needle puller (Model P-2000, Sutter Instruments
Co., Novato, CA, USA). The samples were then analyzed by direct
infusion. Between each measurement the syringe was cleaned with
MeOH and H2O.

Prior to analysis of Pb–PCn complexes, the instrument per-
formance and calibration was checked with polylysine. The ﬂow
rate for standard Pb–PCn complex analysis was 1–3 μL/min. The
optimal settings of the mass spectrometer operated in positive
electrospray ionization mode were: needle voltage, 1.5 kV; capillary
temperature, 200˚C; capillary voltage, 11 V; tube lens, 130 V; res-
olution, 30,000; max. injection time, 100,000 ms; automatic gain
control FT, 1× 106. The spectra were acquired from m/z 300 to
1,600 for Pb–PC2 and from m/z 300 to 2,000 for Pb–PC3 and Pb–
PC4. Mass accuracy of the measurement was better than 2 ppm for
lower mass ions (<1,000 Da) of signal intensities >10%.

RESULTS
ANALYSIS OF STANDARD Pb–PCn COMPLEXES
The full-scan mass spectrum of the Pb–PC2 complexes (Figure 1)
was dominated by the singly charged [M+ H]
ion of PC2 at m/z
540.1427, which matches the elemental composition of protonated
PC2 (C18H30N5O10S2) of 540.1429 with an error <0.2 ppm and
shows the expected isotopic distribution with a mass assignment
<0.5 ppm for signals higher than 10% relative abundance (data
not shown). In addition to the protonated molecular ion peaks at
m/z 536.3 and 538.4 were also present (data not shown), probably
corresponding to oxidized PC2. A singly charged PC2 dimer and its
oxidation products could be seen at m/z 1079.2783, 1077.2632, and
1075.2474. The four peaks observed at m/z 746.1034, 952.0641,
1285.2379, and 1491.1964 correspond to the molecular weight
of singly charged [Pb–PC2]
, and
complexes (Figure 1). Pb–PC2 and Pb2–PC2 were
[Pb2–(PC2)2]
present in sufﬁcient intensity to detect the Pb-speciﬁc isotopic
pattern of both complexes. The measured isotopic pattern of [Pb–
in the m/z range 740–752 is shown in Figure 2 (front). The
PC2]
relative intensity of the peaks at m/z 742.11, 744.10, 745.10, and
746.10 was observed in a ratio, which reﬂects the distribution of
Pb isotopes (naturally occurring ratio: 204Pb 1.5; 206Pb 23.6; 207Pb
22.6; 208Pb 52.3%). The measured isotopic pattern matched the
theoretical pattern (Figure 2, back), with a mass error of 0.7 ppm
or better for signals higher than 10%. Similarly, the isotopic pattern
observed for [Pb2–PC2]
at m/z 944–958, including the isotopic
pattern of two Pb ions, matched the simulated spectra (Figure 3),
with a mass error of 1.1 ppm or less. The signal intensities of the
complexes involving one or two Pb ions and two PC2 molecules
[Pb1–2–(PC2)2] were too low for isotope pattern detection.

DISCUSSION
To test the applicability of nano-ESI-MS for the analysis of Me–
PC complexes, complexes of Pb with standard PCn (n = 2–4) were

analyzed. A method for nano-ESI-MS was developed to character-
ize in vitro formed Me–PC complexes which might also be used
for characterization of in vivo Me–PCn complexes.

with relative intensities higher than 10%). The [M+ H-2]
peaks
observed for PC2–PC4 as well as the [M+ H-4]
peak observed for
PC4, indicate the formation of one or two intramolecular disulﬁde
bonds between cysteine thiol groups within the PC. The formation
of a disulﬁde bond results in a loss of two hydrogens and therefore
a shift from [M+ H]

in other studies (Yen et al., 1999; Navaza et al., 2006).

, indicating a loss of three H

Analysis of Pb–PC complexes revealed the in vitro formation
of Pb–PCn complexes with various stoichiometries and composi-
tions. The m/z detected for the [Pb–PC2]
complex allows two
different covalent complexes, assuming Pb coordination through
thiol groups of PC cysteine. Either Pb is coordinated by one thiol
group whereas the other is present as reduced thiol group, or the
Pb ion is coordinated by both thiol groups present in PC2. In the
second case, additional protonation of the complex must occur
to result in a singly charged complex detectable by nano-ESI-MS.
For the [Pb2–PC2]
complex the detected m/z corresponds to
[PC2+ 2Pb-3]
. This observation
suggests that in addition to the two protons from the SH-groups,
one proton is lost from a carboxylic group. Further studies would
be required to examine whether the complex formation between
one Pb and PC2 involves only thiol groups or Pb is coordinated
by one thiol and one carboxylic group. Similarly, another study
+
observed the loss of 2H
for the binding of two Cd ions
to standard PC5. Binding of a third Cd ion to PC5 was not accom-
+
panied by the loss of H
. The authors suggested the formation of
complexes that involve two thiol coordinated cadmium ions and a
Cd ion which is bound electrostatically to the Cd2–PC5 complex
(Yen et al., 1999). To investigate whether the coordination of met-
als by PC is dependent on the metal and/or the chain length of PC
needs to be further investigated.

Considering that the mass spectra of the Pb–PCn complexes
were dominated by the [M+ H]
peak of the corresponding PCn
indicates that either not all PC was involved in complex formation,
dissociation of Pb–PC complexes occurs during sample analysis,
or that the complexes formed were neutral and therefore not vis-
ible in the nano-ESI-MS spectra. Furthermore, the relatively low
pH 6, needed for optimal ionization, may lead to some complex
dissociation.

The PCn seem to occur mainly in charge state 1+ with the con-

ditions used, as no signal was detected that corresponds to the dou-
bly charged ion. The isotopic pattern of analyzed PCn was com-
pletely resolved. For all PCn the isotopic distribution matched the
theoretical spectra of the corresponding elemental composition

From mass considerations four Pb–PC2, two Pb–PC3, and two
Pb–PC4 complexes were identiﬁed. To prove that both Pb and
PCn are contributing to the detected signals, the measured iso-
topic pattern was compared to the theoretical isotopic pattern.

The appearance of the [Zn–PC2]

The isotopic patterns of the Pb–PC complexes are complex owing
to the isotopic pattern of one or more Pb ions coupled to the
PCs (naturally occurring ratio: 204Pb 1.5; 206Pb 23.6; 207Pb 22.6;
208Pb 52.3%). This very pronounced lead signature is indicative
for the presence of Pb in the [Pb–PC2]
complex at m/z 740–752.
The isotopic pattern of [Pb2–PC2]
is even more complex, since
two Pb ions are present in the complex, but comparison of mea-
sured and theoretical isotopic pattern proves the presence of the
two Pb ions (Figure 3). Formation of [Pb–PC2] and [Pb2–PC2]
complexes was also observed using differential pulse polarogra-
phy (Alberich et al., 2007). Similar observations were made for
Pb–PC3 and Pb–PC4 complexes, showing a good match between
measured and theoretical patterns and a loss of 2H
for each addi-
tionally bound Pb ion. Surprisingly no complexes including three
and four Pb ions were observed for PC3 and PC4. These results
are also in agreement with the complexes observed using voltam-
metric methods (Alberich et al., 2008). In addition, accurate mass
measurements conﬁrmed the proposed elemental compositions.
peak in the presence of Zn
is indicative of complex formation between PC and Zn, which
was conﬁrmed by the isotopic pattern for Zn clearly visible in
the zoom spectrum (Figure 9). This competition between Pb
and Zn may be expected if their complex stability with PC2 is
similar to the stability of their complexes with glutathione, for
which somewhat higher stability constants for Pb than for Zn are
reported (Martell and Smith, 1989). Binding of Zn by PC3 has
been shown in a voltammetric study with multivariate curve res-
olution, and by PC4 using voltammetry and ESI-MS (Cruz et al.,
2005; Chekmeneva et al., 2007). The expected increase of the [Zn–
PC2]
peak with increasing Zn concentration was not observed,
maybe due to an increase of oxidized PC2, indicated by the increase
of the ratio between m/z 538.14 and 540.14, leading to a loss of
potential metal-binding sites. This could also explain the signal loss
observed with increasing Zn concentration. In presence of Cu(II),
phytochelatin oxidation may also explain why no Cu–PC com-
plexes were detected. Similar observations were done in a study
with Cd where a signal loss was observed at concentrations higher
than 0.3 mM Cd (Yen et al., 1999).

extraction of the algal cells under native conditions to preserve
the metal complexes, PC2 and PC3 complexes were detected in a
molecular weight range between 700 and 5,300 Da. PC2 was mainly
observed between 1,000 and 1,600 Da and complexes with Me1–2–
+
(PC2)2 were suggested, with [Pb–(PC2)2]
as the probable most abundant Pb species. The results obtained
here are in qualitative agreement with this study, as the formation
+
of [Pb–PC2]
is shown. [Pb–PC2]
would appear in the SEC
fraction 700–1,050 Da, where PC2 and Pb were also detected. The
abundance distribution of these complexes obtained by ESI-MS
appears to differ somewhat from the SEC results, but it must be
taken into account that the ratio of PC-SH to Pb, as well as the pH
were different in these two studies. Furthermore, it must be con-
sidered that nano-ESI-MS, albeit a soft ionization technique, may
result in dissociation of complexes. The formation of the [Zn–
PC2]
complex after Zn addition also corroborates the results
from SEC, which showed the presence of Zn and Cu, as well as Pb,
in the PC containing fractions. These results also clearly indicate a
possible competition of Zn and Pb for binding to phytochelatins.
These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that upon induction of PCn
by Pb in algae, the PCn may also be bound to other metals.

The application of nano-ESI-MS to examine Me–PC com-
plexes in algae is challenged by practical issues related to the
low intracellular concentration of the Me–PC complexes. There-
fore, further research is needed to improve the sensitivity for
Me–PC complexes by nano-ESI-MS, or respectively to improve
sample preparation to obtain a sufﬁcient amount of PCn from
the algae. For example, considering the measured concentration
of 30 attomol/cell PC2 in C. reinhardtii cells (Scheidegger et al.,
2011a), about 1 L of algal suspension (with a cell density of
8.4× 105 cell/mL) should be preconcentrated into a small vol-
ume (<1 mL) to obtain a sufﬁciently high PC2 concentration for
ESI-MS measurements. In addition, differences between in vivo
and in vitro formed Me–PC complexes should be further exam-
ined to investigate which factors are determining the distribution
among the various complexes.
