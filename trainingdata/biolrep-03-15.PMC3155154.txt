Abstract
Exosomes are small membrane vesicles of endocytic origin secreted by most cell types, and are thought
to play important roles in intercellular communications. Although exosomes were originally described in
1983, interest in these vesicles has really increased dramatically in the last 3 years, after the finding that
they contain mRNA and microRNA. This discovery sparked renewed interest for the general field of
membrane vesicles involved in intercellular communications, and research on these structures has grown
exponentially over the last few years, probing their composition and function, as well as their potential
value as biomarkers.

Introduction
Secreted vesicles known as exosomes were first discov-
ered nearly 30 years ago. But, considered little more than
cellular garbage cans acting to discard unwanted mole-
cular components, exosomes remained little studied for
the next 10 years. Over the past few years, however,
evidence has begun to accumulate that the vesicles are like
signaling payloads containing cell-specific collections of
proteins, lipids, and genetic material that are transported
to other cells where they alter function and physiology.
The findings have reignited interest in exosomes, but also
more generally in all secreted vesicles, whether they can
be called exosomes or not, and the topic has now
blossomed into a full-fledged field of research—that of
vesicle-modulated cell-cell communication.

Two years ago, I began receiving daily emails regarding
my articles on exosomes, requesting reprints, details on
exosome-related protocols, and advice on the purifica-
tion and characterization of
the vesicles. Having
worked in this area for more than 10 years, I thought
I knew all the other researchers working on the subject,
but the requests were coming in from groups I hadn’t
heard of before. The flood of inquiries made me realize
that
the field had been growing, attracting the
attention of more and more researchers in a relatively
short period of time.

A quick glance at the literature confirmed the trend: while
fewer than 20 PubMed-referenced papers using the word
“exosomes” were published in early 2003, and just over
60 in 2007, nearly 350 exosome studies have been
published in the last 3 years alone. The idea thus came to
me and to Graça Raposo, who discovered exosomes from
immune antigen-presenting cells in 1996, to organize an
International Workshop on Exosomes (IWE). Although a
meeting organized by the late Rose Johnstone, who
participated in the first description of exosomes in 1983,
had drawn 25 scientists to Montreal, Canada, in 2005 [1],
the new meeting, which took place this January at our
home institution, the Curie Institute in Paris, attracted
nearly 10 times as many attendees. There, researchers
discussed their recent findings on exosomes, and on other
types of secreted membrane vesicles, in fields ranging
from immunology to neurobiology and tumor biology, as
well as potential clinical applications, such as biomarkers
or as therapeutic tools.

In pluricellular organisms, cells communicate with each
other via extracellular molecules such as nucleotides,
lipids, short peptides, or proteins. These molecules are
released extracellularly by cells and bind to receptors on
other cells, thus inducing intracellular signaling and
modification of the intracellular physiological state of the
recipient cells. But, in addition to these single molecules,

eukaryotic cells also release in their extracellular environ-
ment complex structures called membrane vesicles, which
contain numerous proteins, lipids, and even nucleic acids,
and can affect the cells that encounter these structures in
much more complex ways. Although known to exist for
several decades (for instance, in blood, where they are
generally called “microparticles”, or in seminal fluid, where
they are called “prostasomes” [2]), membrane vesicles have
long been thought of as mere cell debris, signs of cell death,
or structures very specific to a unique organ. The
phenomenon of exosomes and their wider involvement
in intercellular signaling began to emerge from this picture
in the last decade.

Exosomes represent a specific subtype of secreted
membrane vesicles (reviewed in [3]). Exosomes are
formed in endosomal compartments called multivesicu-
lar endosomes, containing internal vesicles that package
and store molecules in membrane-bound structures.
Endosomes are generally considered to function as an
intermediate compartment between the plasma mem-
brane, where endocytosis of extracellular molecules takes
place, and compartments (lysosomes), where these
molecules are released and degraded. However, about
25 years ago, the groups of Philip Stahl [4] in the United
States and Rose Johnstone in Canada [5] described, using
very elegant pulse-chase and electron microscopy experi-
ments, that in reticulocytes undergoing maturation into
red blood cells, multivesicular late endosomes could fuse
back with the plasma membrane (instead of with
lysosomes), and release their contents, including numer-
ous small vesicles, extracellularly. In 1987, the term
“exosomes” was proposed to define these extracellularly
released intra-endosomal vesicles [6].

Exosomes remained all but forgotten for the next 10 years
until Raposo, while working with the group of Hans
Geuze in Holland in 1996 [7], showed that Epstein–Barr
virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphocytes secreted exosomes
that bore molecules essential for the adaptive immune
response: major histocompatibility class (MHC) II dimers
bound to antigenic peptides. These exosomes were also
shown to present the MHC–peptide complexes to specific
T cells, suggesting that they could play a role in adaptive
immune responses. Two years later, the groups of Raposo,
Amigorena, and Zitvogel [8] demonstrated that dendritic
cells (the immune cells that initiate adaptive immune
responses by presenting MHC–peptide complexes to naïve
T cells) also secrete exosomes bearing functional MHC–
peptide complexes, which could promote induction of
antitumor immune responses in mice in vivo. These results
provided the basis for the hypothesis that exosomes could
play an active role in intercellular communication, at least
in the immune system, and prompted the very first attempt

at using them in the clinic, as a new type of anticancer
therapy in humans. (After phase I trials held between 1999
and 2002, a phase II trial is currently ongoing at the
Gustave Roussy Institute (with participation of the Curie
Institute) in France [9].)

The first major advance of subsequent years was linked
to the development of large-scale protein analysis techni-
ques, which allowed us to demonstrate that exosomes
represent a specific subcellular compartment, rather than
random cell debris. Proteomic analyses of exosome
composition were first performed on exosomes secreted
by dendritic cells [10,11], and then on exosomes from
numerous other different cell types, which are compiled
in the ExoCarta compendium [12]. These studies showed
that exosomes did not contain a random array of the
intracellular proteins, but a specific set of a few protein
families, essentially coming from the plasma membrane,
endocytic pathway, and the cytosol, with very limited
amounts of proteins from other intracellular compart-
ments (e.g., nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi
apparatus), which made them clearly different from
membrane vesicles released by apoptotic cells. These results
established that exosomes are actively secreted by live cells,
and confirmed their intra-endosomal origin. In parallel,
studies of exosomes purified in vitro from tissue cultures (of
immune cells but also epithelial and tumor cells), started
showing that exosomes secreted by one cell could be
captured by another cell and transfer information to the
latter. The information transferred could include antigens
or MHC–peptide complexes for increasing the range of
antigen-presenting cells and the efficiency of induction of
immune responses [13-15], or in some cases negative
signals leading to death of the target cell [16]. These
observations provide the basis of the nowadays popular
idea that exosomes represent a new type of intercellular
messenger.

The second real breakthrough in this field came in 2007,
with the convincing description by the group of Jan Lötvall
in Sweden of the presence of mRNA and microRNA
(miRNA) inside these vesicles [17]. In addition, the authors
showed, at least in vitro using large amounts of concen-
trated exosomes, that some mRNA present in exosomes
could be translated into proteins in target cells, suggesting
that exosomes can transfer genetic information. This
discovery, and the concomitant development of research
on miRNAs, sparked the recent exponential increase in the
numbers of papers on exosomes.

In January 2011, oral and poster presentations at the IWE
2011 covered all the currently explored fields of exosome
research spanning immunology and cell biology, their
use as biomarkers, and their relationship to tumors.

This led to very open and constructive discussions. My four
major conclusions from this meeting are that: (a) exosomes
are not the only secreted membrane vesicles that could
act as intercellular messengers, and efforts should be
dedicated to combine and compare data obtained on
these different vesicles; (b) the next few years should show
us whether RNA and miRNA in circulating vesicles
(exosomes or others) will prove to be useful biomarkers
of various diseases, providing new diagnostic or prognostic
tools; (c) although they were originally described in cells
of the immune system, exosomes are now known to be
secreted by many different cell types, and a large amount of
recent data highlight their possible functions as messengers
during development of tumors, in some functions of stem

cells, in the nervous system, or during interactions of
pathogens with their host; (d) although the last 3 decades
have expanded our knowledge of exosomes considerably,
there is still no definite evidence for their physiological
functions in vivo, and demonstrating such functions
remains a major challenge of this field.

Exosomes and other secreted membrane
vesicles
The term “exosomes” should be used to define secreted
membrane vesicles that form inside intracellular multi-
vesicular compartments and that are released upon fusion
of
these compartments with the plasma membrane
(Figure 1). Because of this intracellular origin, exosomes

are similar in size to internal vesicles of multivesicular
compartments; that is, around 100 nm in diameter.
Exosomes are commonly purified on the basis of size by
serial steps of centrifugation, with a final 100,000 g
ultracentrifugation to pellet exosomes; however, this
purification is not absolute. Some cells also release other
types of membrane vesicles, which can, for instance,
directly bud off the plasma membrane towards the outside
of the cell. The size of such vesicles is not as strictly
determined as that of exosomes, and they can be anywhere
between 50–1,000 nm in diameter. Various terms have
been used for these vesicles, such as “ectosomes” [18],
“shed vesicles”, or “microvesicles”, but this latter term has
also been used more widely for any type of vesicle,
whether intra- or extracellular, and regardless of its
intracellular origin. The release of large plasma mem-
brane-derived vesicles is quickly induced after stimuli such
as fresh fetal calf serum on tumor cells [19], complement
deposition, or increasing intracellular Ca2+ in neutrophils
[20]. Vesicles can be separated by size using ultracentrifu-
gation at different speeds, with the larger vesicles pelleting
at lower speed than the smaller ones. But similarly sized
vesicles of different intracellular origins (i.e., exosomes
and small plasma membrane-derived vesicles) will not
be separated by this method. Flotation of vesicles on
sucrose gradients can allow some separation of vesicles
with different densities, but
this separation is not
complete. Thus, adequate means to distinguish the
different types of vesicles secreted by a cell are still lacking.

Proteomic studies of microvesicles or ectosomes have not,
so far, been as extensive as for exosomes, but they are
underway and they will help to understand the specificity
of their secretion. Like exosomes, membrane microvesi-
cles and ectosomes contain various active molecules, such
as cytokines, growth factor receptors, and RNAs, and also
metalloproteases (which have not been described in
exosomes), but since studies comparing exosomes and
other vesicles released by the same cells are only
beginning now, understanding the functional specificity
of each type of vesicle should become possible in the next
few years.

RNA and miRNA in secreted membrane
vesicles
Since the identification of RNA in exosomes in 2007 and
development of high-throughput techniques for nucleic
acid analyses, there have been an ever increasing number
of studies reporting sequences of the RNA in exosomes.
Such studies show that not all messenger RNAs present in
a cell end up in exosomes, and there is apparently specific
targeting of some mRNA sequences into the released
vesicles [17]. These last observations refute the idea that
mRNA in exosomes results from a random contamination

of secreted vesicles by mRNA released extracellularly by
dying cells. However, it is still unclear from the few
published studies whether one can (as for exosomal
proteins) find a set of exosomal mRNA that would be
consistently targeted to exosomes in any cell type, possibly
in addition to cell type-specific mRNA sequences. Under-
standing the mechanisms of mRNA targeting to these
vesicles should open the way to understanding the
function of RNA delivery to secreted vesicles. Of note,
mRNA has also been described in microvesicles (or mixed
exosome/microvesicle preparations) released by tumors
or embryonic stem cells [21-23], and some ongoing
studies are now comparing sequences of RNA targeted to
either exosomes or larger vesicles, and determining
whether there is a distinct targeting to each of them.

The situation is even more complicated for miRNA: even
though they have also been observed in various exosome
preparations, the heterogeneity of techniques used to
identify the miRNA sequences do not allow one to conclude
whether there is specific targeting of miRNA to secreted
vesicles. In addition, although extracellular release of
miRNA can be decreased by some drugs, the literature still
describes heterogeneous results concerning the respective
contribution of free (or protein-associated) miRNA, as
compared to miRNA encapsulated in exosomes or other
secreted membrane vesicles.

Despite the uncertainties about the nature of mRNA and
miRNA-carrying vesicles, the biopharma industry has put
a lot of effort into studying the use of secreted vesicles—
especially their mRNA and miRNA content—as biomar-
kers in clinics. This is easier than it might seem to be
because their encapsulation into membrane vesicles
protects extracellular RNAs from degradation, and allows
efficient recovery from biological fluids, such as plasma,
urine, milk, sperm, or saliva. Work in several different
laboratories to compare RNA (as well as protein)
sequences in vesicles isolated from normal and cancer
cell lines, for instance, and from biological fluids of
patients (cancer or other diseases) is ongoing. It is still
too early to propose new biomarkers (either
for
diagnosis, prognosis, or predictive response to therapies)
from these studies, but given the current effort put in this
direction, the next few years should allow us to decide
whether such markers exist and are useful.

Proposed functions of exosomes
Once secreted, membrane vesicles interact with surround-
ing cells: many fluorescence microscopy studies show
capture of these vesicles and accumulation in internal
endocytic or phagocytic compartments, especially in
phagocytic cells such as macrophages, but one must
keep in mind that vesicles smaller than 200 nm in

diameter cannot be detected by confocal microscopy
techniques, and only electron microscopy allows detailed
visualization of exosomes. Hence, the way individual
vesicles interact with recipient cells is still not known,
and has been proposed to involve binding at the cell
surface via specific receptors, internalization by endocy-
tosis or micropinocytosis, and/or fusion with plasma
membrane or with the limiting membrane of internal
compartments. Evidence that fusion does occur in certain
cases comes from a recent study showing diffusion of
exosomal lipids in the membrane of recipient cells [24]:
this observation explains how exosomes could release
their internal content (e.g., RNA) into the cytosol of
recipient cells.

Exosomes induce physiological changes in recipient cells
upon interaction. Because the original description of
exosomes was in immune cells, there is a vast amount of
data on the immunological effects of exosomes, and
these vary strongly depending on the physiological state
of the cells which secrete them (see [9] for references).
For instance, mature dendritic cells secrete exosomes that
carry antigens or MHC–peptide complexes, and induce
antigen-specific immune responses by other dendritic
cells (especially in the context of anticancer therapies);
conversely, exosomes secreted by dendritic cells sub-
jected to immunosuppressive treatments, or modified to
express immunosuppressive cytokines, can instead pro-
mote tolerogenic immune responses, which could make
them useful as a treatment for autoimmune diseases. In a
third example, macrophages infected with procaryotic
mycobacteria release exosomes that, depending on the
mycobacteria strain, bear antigens and promote immune
responses (nonpathogenic strain), or inhibit macro-
phage activation and cytokine secretion, thus dampening
immune response (pathogenic strain).

Although exosomes secreted by tumor cells carry antigens
from the secreting tumors and can be captured and used
to present tumor antigens by dendritic cells, they also
bear various immunosuppressive molecules, which can
inactivate T lymphocytes or natural killer cells, or
promote the differentiation of regulatory T lymphocytes
or myeloid cells (which suppress immune responses).
The net result of these contradictory effects in vivo is not
yet established, and although several groups defend the
hypothesis that tumors secrete exosomes to promote
their growth by inhibiting antitumor immune responses,
or by promoting angiogenesis or migration outside the
tumor bed to form metastases, this has not been proved.
Still, it has been suggested that depletion of membrane
vesicles from the blood circulation of patients could be
used as an anticancer treatment [25], but I would be
cautious in using such approaches in the absence of

proper understanding of what tumor-derived exosomes
or other membrane vesicles do in vivo. An alternative
explanation is that membrane vesicles of tumor origin in
the circulation of cancer patients could simply be the
result of tumor expansion, rather than a sign of active
involvement of these vesicles in tumor progression.

Other tissues or cells secrete exosomes bearing immuno-
suppressive molecules: placenta-derived vesicles, which
bear ligands for natural killer lymphocytes, are found in
pregnant women’s blood circulation, and extensive
analyses of components of these vesicles are underway
to identify their role in the mother’s tolerance to the fetus.
Depending on the state of the host, exosomes (or vesicles)
present in their bronchoalveolar fluid can bear tolerizing
molecules (e.g., in mice tolerized for an allergen) or,
conversely, increase proinflammatory cytokine secretion
by airway epithelial cells (in asthmatic human patients).
Secretion of exosomes by eukaryotic parasites (Leishmania
major) or pathogens (such as fungi) has also been recently
described. It is thought to contribute to tolerance of the
host for the parasite by dampening immune response or,
conversely, to contribute pathologic inflammatory reac-
tions of the host to the pathogen.

In addition to the immune system, exosomes probably
affect other physiological
functions. Exosomes are
secreted by neural, epithelial, muscle, and stem cells,
and their range of proposed functions is extensive.
Exosomes from mesenchymal stem cells contribute to
tissue repair of host cardiac tissue, and, conversely, lung
tissue can release exosomes (or possibly other vesicles)
that modify stem cells to promote differentiation of the
lung tissue into lung epithelial cells [26,27]. Exosomes
also contribute to communication within the nervous
system. Exosomes are secreted by neurons, oligodendro-
glial cells, and microglia, and exosomes from each source
can affect other neural cells [28-30]. Exosomes are
involved in the formation/transfer of pathogenic proteins
(such as prions and amyloid deposits) [31,32]. No doubt
other functions will appear in the coming years!

Physiological functions of exosomes
Despite the amount of data on what exosomes (and other
secreted membrane vesicles) can do in vitro, or in vivo
when injected into animals, all data discussed above were
obtained with vesicles purified and concentrated in vitro
from cell culture supernatants or from biological fluids,
so it is not clear whether these processes occur under
physiological conditions. The main problem is that the
efficiency of the purification and quantification proce-
dures is unknown. It is likely that ultracentrifugation
does not allow 100% recovery of the vesicles secreted at
any given time, and that part of the secreted vesicles are

even inaccessible to purification because they are
recaptured by cells rather than released in the culture
medium or fluid, so it is very difficult to know whether
the amounts of membrane vesicles used to observe the
effects described above correspond to physiological
amounts secreted in vivo, or not. Indeed, there remains
a nagging question in the exosome field as to whether
they actually have any physiological functions in vivo.

Answering this question requires tools to inhibit or
increase exosome secretion specifically, without affecting
secretion of other membrane vesicles, or affecting general
secretion of proteins or lipid mediators. Several groups are
currently trying to identify such tools, especially by
deciphering the molecular mechanisms involved in
formation of intracellular vesicles of multivesicular com-
partments, and in the fusion of these compartments with
the plasma membrane. Several molecules have been
shown to affect exosome secretion, although in the absence
of means to visualize and quantify actual fusion of
multivesicular endosomes with the plasma membrane in
real time, it is still difficult to know whether they are
involved specifically in this final step, or at another stage of
the endocytic pathway. A consensus has not yet been
reached on the molecular mechanisms involved. Indeed,
depending on the cell types, different molecules have been
described in the biogenesis and secretion of exosomes:
Rab11 in erythroleukemia cell lines [33], Rab27 in Hela
cells [34], and Rab35 and neutral sphingomyelinase in
oligodendroglial cells [35,36]. It remains to be determined
whether these discrepancies are due to different machi-
neries used in different cell types, and/or whether the
secreted vesicles analyzed in the different studies come
from different intracellular compartments (along the
endocytic pathway, or even outside this pathway). Recent
studies showing that internal vesicles of multivesicular
endosomes can, in some circumstances, form without the
help of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required
for transport) machinery (described as being responsible
for segregation of molecules into internal vesicles of late
endosomes in yeast) suggest that, indeed, more types of
multivesicular compartments than initially thought may
coexist in the same cells, and may possibly lead to different
types of exosomes. In any case, targeting one or the other of
these molecules to affect exosome secretion will require
careful evaluation of the consequences (in terms of
exosomes, but also other secretions) in each different
model system analyzed. Other approaches to address the
physiological functions of exosomes in vivo, proposed
during the meeting in Paris, include generating exosomes
with modified expression of a given functional protein and
analyzing their functional outcome, or containing bacterial
enzymes to identify target cells via measurement of the
enzymatic activity. Using these approaches in genetically

modified mice will be the next step for this challenging
field.

Finally, similar cell biology studies on the generation of
other secreted membrane vesicles are also underway, and
hopefully will allow proper discrimination of the roles as
messengers of the different types of vesicles.

Conclusion
With the amazing expansion of the number of published
studies on exosomes in the last 3 years, it is clear that
research on secreted membrane vesicles and their roles as
intercellular messengers is now a very exciting field, with
new ideas, hypotheses, and questions coming up faster
than answers! The IWE in Paris allowed most of the long-
term exosome and vesicle aficionados, as well as many of
the newcomers, to meet, exchange ideas freely, and to
point out current problems with technologies, definitions,
and characterization. The meeting ended with the decision
to prolong this very productive workshop by setting up
future yearly meetings, virtual spaces to record exchanges
and discussions (such as a website and/or a Facebook
page), and a scientific society dedicated to exosomes and
secreted membrane vesicles. Some of these are already
underway, with the next IWE tentatively scheduled for
April 2012, a Facebook page already up and running [37],
a website for comparison of protein and RNA composition
of exosomes already set up [38], and the rest hopefully
coming soon. We strongly encourage the readers of this
article to check these web links [37,38] to follow the next
steps of this emerging scientific world.
