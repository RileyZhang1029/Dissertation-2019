Background and Objective: Campylobacter rectus is considered as one of the bacterial species of etiological
importance in periodontitis. Iron-containing proteins such as transferrin are found in periodontal sites and
may serve as a source of iron for periodontopathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of
C. rectus to assimilate transferrin-bound iron to support its growth.
Design: Growth studies were performed in broth media pretreated with an iron-chelating resin and
supplemented with various iron sources. The uptake of iron by C. rectus was monitored using 55Fe-
transferrin. Transferrin-binding activity was assessed using a microplate assay while the degradation of
transferrin and iron removal was evaluated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A colorimetric assay was
used to determine ferric reductase activity.
Results: Holotransferrin (iron-saturated form) but not apotransferrin (iron-free form) was found to support
growth of C. rectus in an iron-restricted culture medium. Incubation of holotransferrin with cells of C. rectus
resulted in removal of iron from the protein. A time dependent intracellular uptake of iron by C. rectus cells
from 55Fe-transferrin was demonstrated. This uptake was significantly increased when bacteria were grown
under an iron-limiting condition. Cells of C. rectus did not show transferrin-binding activity or proteolytic
activity toward transferrin. However, a surface-associated ferric reductase activity was demonstrated.
Conclusion: To survive and multiply in periodontal sites, periodontopathogens must possess efficient iron-
scavenging mechanisms. In this study, we showed the capacity of C. rectus to assimilate iron from transferrin
to support its growth. The uptake of iron appears to be dependent on a ferric reductive pathway.

Periodontitis, a destructive chronic inflammatory

disease, results from a polymicrobial
infection
and is characterized by the destruction of tooth-
supporting tissues including the alveolar bone. Although
more than 700 bacterial species are found in the oral
cavity (1), a group of about 10 bacterial species has been
strongly associated with periodontitis (2). There is now a
consensus that Campylobacter rectus is a member of this
group (3). Indeed, the proportions and levels of C. rectus
are higher in periodontitis sites compared with healthy
sites (3, 4). This Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium is
also frequently recovered from root canal infections (5).
Very recently, Arce et al. (6) demonstrated that C. rectus
has the ability to translocate in vivo from a distant site of
infection to the placenta suggesting that it may be an
important contributor to adverse pregnancy outcomes
associated with periodontal disease.

Iron is a constituent of important metabolic enzymes and
is essential for the growth of almost all microorganisms.
Consequently, a critical virulence determinant of micro-
organisms is their ability to obtain iron from their hosts.
Although there is an abundance of iron in the extra-
cellular tissue fluids of human, the amount of free ionic
iron (1018 M) is far too low to support growth of most
bacteria (7, 8). Transferrin is a serum glycoprotein
possessing two iron-binding sites and is important in
vivo for rendering iron unavailable to bacteria (7).
Transferrin as well as other iron-containing proteins,
including hemoglobin and lactoferrin, are known consti-
tuents of gingival crevicular fluid (9). In addition, Goulet
et al. (10) reported that gingival crevicular fluid samples
obtained from periodontitis patients show the presence of
both transferrin and transferrin fragments, which
amounts are correlated with the severity of the disease.

Therefore, in the course of periodontitis, transferrin may
represent an important source of iron for periodonto-
pathogens.

Different mechanisms by which periodontopathogens
can acquire iron from human transferrin to support their
growth have been previously described (1012). Prevotella
nigrescens and Prevotella intermedia possess cell surface
receptors with the capacity to bind transferrin (11).
Porphyromonas gingivalis produces arginine-x-specific
and lysine-x-specific gingipains that mediate a proteolytic
cleavage of transferrin resulting in disruption of the iron-
binding sites with the subsequent release and uptake of
free iron (10, 12). The aim of this study was to investigate
the capacity of C. rectus to assimilate transferrin-bound
iron to support its growth.

Materials and methods

Bacteria and growth studies
C. rectus ATCC 33238 was routinely grown in myco-
plasma broth base (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cock-
eysville, MD), which was
supplemented with 0.2%
glucose, 0.2% sodium formate, and 0.2% sodium fuma-
rate (MBB-GFF). Growth studies were performed using
the above medium treated with the chelating resin (3 g/
100 ml) Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga,
Ontario) for 2 h at room temperature with constant
agitation. This iron-restricted medium was supplemented
with either ferrous sulfate, human apotransferrin (iron-
free form), or human holotransferrin (iron-saturated
form), all at 20 mM and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
Canada (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Cultures were
incubated
chamber
(N2:H2:CO2/80:10:10). Bacterial growth was evaluated
after 48 h of incubation by measuring the optical density
at 660 nm (OD660).

Removal of iron from iron-saturated transferrin
Equal volumes of holotransferrin (0.5 mg/ml) and C.
rectus cells (OD6600.5), treated or not at 608C for 30
min, were incubated at room temperature for 2 h.
Removal of iron from human holotransferrin was deter-
mined by urea/borate/EDTA-polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis (PAGE) analysis and Coomassie Blue staining
(13). This electrophoretic procedure allows the differen-
tiation of transferrin in the apo- (iron-free) and holo-
(iron-saturated) forms.

Uptake of iron from transferrin by C. rectus cells
The 55Fe-transferrin was prepared based on the protocols
of Pintor et al. (14) and Simonson et al. (15) using human
apotransferrin and [55Fe]FeCl3 (NEN Life Science Pro-
ducts Inc., Boston, MA). Apotransferrin at 1 mg/ml was
mixed with 0.0075 mmol of [55Fe]FeCl3 and 0.075 mmol of
sodium citrate in 40 mM Tris hydrochloride buffer (pH

7.4) containing 2 mM sodium carbonate. After incuba-
tion at room temperature for 30 min, several rounds of
dialysis (molecular weight cutoff1214 kDa; 12 h) were
performed at 48C against 40 mM Tris hydrochloride
buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mM sodium carbonate until
no radioactivity was detected in the dialysate using a
gamma counter. Thereafter, the final concentration of
transferrin was determined by the method of Lowry (16)
whereas the iron saturation percentage of transferrin was
evaluated by a colorimetric assay (Sigma-Aldrich Ca-
nada). By performing these assays, the 55Fe-transferrin
preparation was estimated to be 80% iron-saturated. The
uptake of 55Fe from 55Fe-transferrin by C. rectus cells was
determined as follows. The bacteria were grown to late
exponential growth phase in MBB-GFF medium. Bac-
terial cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,000g for
15 min) and suspended to an OD660 of 1 in MBB-GFF
medium treated (iron-restricted condition) or not (nor-
mal condition) with the Chelex 100 resin. Heat-inacti-
vated bacteria (608C for 30 min) were also tested. Equal
volumes of 55Fe-transferrin (13 mM) and bacteria were
incubated at 378C under anaerobiosis for 0, 3, and 24 h.
Following incubation, cells were harvested by centrifuga-
tion (8,000g for 15 min), washed twice in PBS, and
resuspended in the same buffer to an OD660 of 1. The
radioactivity associated with the bacteria was quantified
using a gamma counter.

Proteolytic degradation of transferrin
Equal volumes of holotransferrin (0.5 mg/ml) and over-
night culture of C. rectus in MBB-GFF medium were
incubated at 378C for 1, 6, and 24 h. Proteolytic cleavage
of holotransferrin was evaluated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)  PAGE followed by Western immunoblot-
ting using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-
human transferrin antibody (1:3,000 dilution). Un-
degraded transferrin and transferrin fragments were
visualized following development in 100 mM carbonate
buffer (pH 9.8) containing 0.3 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazo-
lium chloride and 0.15 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indo-
lylphosphate p-toluidine salt. A culture of P. nigrescens
ATCC 33563 in Todd-Hewitt broth (BBL Microbiology
Systems) supplemented with hemin (10 mg/ml) and
vitamin K (1 mg/ml) was used as a positive control (11).

Transferrin-binding activity
The transferrin-binding activity of C. rectus cells was
determined by a microplate assay. Bacterial suspensions
(100 ml; OD6601 in 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline
[PBS]) prepared from an overnight culture in MBB-GFF
medium (treated or not with Chelex 100) were applied
into wells of a flat-bottomed 96-well microplate, which
was then covered and incubated overnight at 378C.
Bacterial suspensions were removed by aspiration and
wells were washed with PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20

(PBST) to remove loosely bound bacteria. Bacterial cells
attached on the bottom of wells were fixed with 0.05%
glutaraldehyde (1 h) and the wells were further washed
three times with PBST. The unreacted sites were then
blocked with PBS containing 3% gelatin for 1 h. The
solution was discarded and 100 ml of horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated transferrin (0.2 mg/ml
in PBS;
Bio/Can Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario) was added.
After a 2-h incubation, wells were washed three times for
5 min with PBST prior to adding 100 ml of 2,2’-azino-
bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) sub-
strate was added. Following incubation at 378C for 30
min, the absorbance at 405 nm (A405) was measured using
a microplate reader. Cells of P. nigrescens ATCC 33563
were used as a positive control (11).

Iron reductase activity
The protocol of Morrissey et al. (17) was used to detect
ferric reductase activity in whole cells of C. rectus from an
overnight culture in MBB-GFF treated with Chelex 100
or with no pretreatment. Cells were suspended in 1 ml of
the assay buffer (50 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.5, 5%
to an OD660 of 1.
glucose, 1 mM ferric chloride)
Bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPDS) was then added
to a final concentration of 1 mM and samples were
incubated at 378C for 30 and 120 min. Bacterial cells were
then removed by centrifugation and the red Fe2BPS
complex was quantified by recording the absorbance of
the assay mixture supernatant at 520 nm (A520). The level
of ferrous ions produced was estimated from a reference
curve constructed from a solution of known ion con-
centrations.

Results
Results of growth studies for C. rectus cultivated under
various iron conditions are presented in Table 1. When
the MBB-GFF medium was rendered iron-restricted by
treatment with the cation-chelating resin, only a slight
growth of C. rectus occurred. Adding either ferrous
sulfate or holotransferrin stimulated growth of C. rectus.
Using apotransferrin, the iron-free form of transferrin,

A study on the assimilation of transferrin-bound iron by C. rectus

instead of holotransferrin did not promote growth of
C. rectus.

To correlate the capacity of holotransferrin to support
growth of C. rectus with the uptake of bound iron, we
first demonstrated iron removal from transferrin by urea/
borate/EDTA-PAGE analysis. While the C. rectus culture
supernatant incubated with holotransferrin had no effect
on the level of iron saturation (data not shown), cells of
C. rectus caused a complete removal of iron (Fig. 1). This
capacity was lost if bacteria were heat-treated. We then
monitored the uptake of iron from 55Fe-transferrin by
cells of C. rectus. As shown in Fig. 2, C. rectus assimilated
55Fe in a time-dependent manner. When bacteria were
incubated with 55Fe-transferrin under an iron-restricted
condition, a significantly higher capacity to assimilate
55Fe was noted after a 24-h incubation. Treating C. rectus
cells at 608C (30 min) completely abolished the uptake of
iron thus suggesting the involvement of an active enzy-
matic process.

To investigate whether proteolytic degradation may be
involved in the uptake of iron-bound transferrin, holo-
transferrin was incubated with a culture of C. rectus for
various periods of time. As shown in Fig. 3, no break-
down products were detected by SDS-PAGE analysis
indicating that proteases active on transferrin are not
produced by C. rectus. On the contrary, P. nigrescens used
as a positive control degraded holotransferrin into lower
molecular weight fragments (Fig. 3). Since transferrin-
binding activity may represent a mechanism of iron
acquisition, we analyzed this property in C. rectus.

Results presented in Fig. 4 indicate that C. rectus does
not possess the ability to bind holotransferrin, on the
contrary of P. nigrescens used as positive control.

Lastly, the presence of a cell surface ferric reductase
activity in C. rectus was investigated using a colorimetric
assay. As reported in Table 2,
ferric reduction was
detected after 30 min and increased markedly at 120
min. As observed for the uptake of iron from 55Fe-
transferrin, the ferric reductase activity was more pro-
nounced for cells grown under iron-restricted conditions.

Discussion
Although numerous studies have reported on the me-
chanisms of iron acquisition by periodontopathogens
(1012, 1820), there was no data in the literature on
C. rectus. In this study, we evaluated the ability of
C. rectus to utilize human transferrin as a source of
iron and investigated the mechanism by which iron can be
obtained from this plasma protein. Transferrin, whose
major physiological roles are the absorption, transport,
and exchange of iron in tissues, plays an important role
in host defense by rendering the iron unavailable for
microorganisms (7). The transferrin concentration in
gingival crevicular fluid has been reported to be approxi-
mately 70% of that in serum, which is in the range of 20
40 mM (21). It thus represents a potential source of iron in
subgingival sites. The C. rectus was found to grow in the
presence of holotransferrin (iron-loaded form) as the sole
source of iron. Using 55Fe-transferrin, we showed that
cells of C. rectus were able to efficiently remove and
assimilate iron bound to transferrin. This iron-uptake
was found to be significantly increased when C. rectus
cells were grown under iron-restricted conditions. Such a
capacity to acquire iron from this host protein may be of
utmost importance for the ability of C. rectus to establish

and multiply in periodontal sites or to cause infections
at distant sites. Previous studies have shown that P.
gingivalis (10, 12, 18), P. intermedia (11), and P. nigrescens
(11) can also use transferrin as a source of iron.

Thereafter, experiments were carried out to attempt to
identify the mechanism by which C. rectus can sequester
iron bound to transferrin. In a previous study (11), we
reported that the capacity of P. nigrescens to use iron-
bound transferrin was related to its capacity to bind the
protein on its surface or to proteolytically cleave it.
However, C. rectus did not show transferrin-binding
activity or proteolytic activity toward transferrin. We
then investigated the presence of a cell surface ferric
reductase activity in C. rectus since reduction of ferric to
ferrous may favor iron release from transferrin. Our
results clearly showed that C. rectus is capable of reducing
Fe3 to Fe2. The ferric reductase activity of C. rectus
was increased when cells were cultivated under iron-
restricted conditions, in agreement with our data on the
uptake of iron from 55Fe-transferrin by cells of C. rectus.
Interestingly, a ferric reductase activity has been pre-
viously reported in another species of Campylobacter
(jejuni), although its
role in iron acquisition from
transferrin has not been established (22). Ferric reductase
activity as a mechanism of iron acquisition from trans-
ferrin has been previously reported in other pathogens
including Candida albicans (23) and Histoplasma capsu-
latum (24).

In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time
the ability of C. rectus to use iron-bound transferrin to
support its growth. Although C. rectus does not appear
to possess a specific receptor for transferrin, a surface-
associated ferric reductase may physically interact with
the substrate to generate reduced ferrous iron that may in
turn be captured and transported across the cell envelope
by a transporter system that remains to be identified. The
iron liberated from transferrin may also enter into cells
through outer membrane porins. However, one should
not exclude the possibility that C. rectus possesses
additional mechanisms for iron acquisition from host
iron-containing proteins.’
