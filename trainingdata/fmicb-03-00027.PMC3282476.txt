Experimental approaches to identify horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events of non-mobile
DNA in bacteria have typically relied on detection of the initial transformants or their imme-
diate offspring. However, rare HGT events occurring in large and structured populations are
unlikely to be detected in a short time frame. Population genetic modeling of the growth
dynamics of bacterial genotypes is therefore necessary to account for natural selection
and genetic drift during the time lag and to predict realistic time frames for detection with
a given sampling design. Here we draw on statistical approaches to population genetic
theory to construct a cohesive probabilistic framework for investigation of HGT of exoge-
nous DNA into bacteria. In particular, the stochastic timing of rare HGT events is accounted
for. Integrating over all possible event timings, we provide an equation for the probability
of detection, given that HGT actually occurred. Furthermore, we identify the key variables
determining the probability of detecting HGT events in four different case scenarios that
are representative of bacterial populations in various environments. Our theoretical analy-
sis provides insight into the temporal aspects of dissemination of genetic material, such as
antibiotic resistance genes or transgenes present in genetically modiﬁed organisms. Due
to the long time scales involved and the exponential growth of bacteria with differing ﬁt-
ness, quantitative analyses incorporating bacterial generation time, and levels of selection,
such as the one presented here, will be a necessary component of any future experimental
design and analysis of HGT as it occurs in natural settings.

INTRODUCTION
Bacteria in natural populations are known to import and inte-
grate exogenous genetic material of diverse, often unidentiﬁed,
origins (Eisen, 2000; Ochman et al., 2000; Lawrence, 2002; Naka-
mura et al., 2004; Didelot and Maiden, 2010). Bacterial genomes
can be exposed not only to the multitude of sources of exogenous
DNA present in their natural environments (Levy-Booth et al.,
2007; Nielsen et al., 2007; Pontiroli et al., 2007; Pietramellara et al.,
2009; Rizzi et al., 2012), but also to introduced sources of novel
DNA such as the fraction of recombinant DNA present in geneti-
cally modiﬁed organisms (GMOs). Such exposure can potentially
lead to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events of GMO recombi-
nant DNA, dependent on the multitude of parameters that govern
HGT processes in various environments (Bertolla and Simonet,
1999; Bensasson et al., 2004). However, for long-term persistence
of infrequently acquired genetic material in new bacterial hosts,
a conferred selective advantage is considered necessary (Feil and
Spratt, 2001; Berg and Kurland, 2002; Johnsen et al., 2009; Kuo
and Ochman, 2010). Experimental investigations have shown that
most HGT events that integrate into the bacterial chromosome are
deleterious (Elena et al., 1998; Remold and Lenski, 2004). Thus,
in terms of the persistence of its signature and its effects on ﬁt-
ness, HGT processes resemble routine mutational processes that

take place at similarly low frequencies in bacteria and that are
eventually lost from the population (Kimura and Ohta, 1969; Jor-
gensen and Kurland, 1987; Lawrence et al., 2001; Mira et al., 2001;
Johnsen et al., 2011). However, rare HGT events and mutations
can be positively selected under particular conditions and are the
sources of bacterial adaptation and evolution (Imhof and Schlöt-
terer, 2001; Townsend et al., 2003; Orr, 2005; Barret et al., 2006).
HGT is particularly well known for playing a central role in the
evolution of resistance to antibacterial agents (Bergstrom et al.,
2000; Heinemann and Traavik, 2004; Aminov and Mackie, 2007;
Aminov, 2010, 2011).

The detection of HGT events in a given bacterial genome can be
performed retrospectively through bioinformatics-based compar-
ative analyses (Ochman et al., 2000; Spratt et al., 2001; Nakamura
et al., 2004; Didelot and Maiden, 2010). Alternatively, events may
be detected via focused experimental efforts on deﬁned bacte-
rial populations under controlled conditions in the laboratory
or monitoring efforts on subsamples taken from bacterial pop-
ulations present in various environments, e.g., from soil, water,
wounds, or gastrointestinal tracts (GITs; Nielsen and Townsend,
2004; Thomas and Nielsen, 2005; Pontiroli et al., 2009; Aminov,
2011). The latter approach can enable the identiﬁcation of HGT
events as they occur in the context of complex interactions of

diverse bacterial communities. Its main limitation is sensitivity
due to restricted sampling capacity of large bacterial populations,
other methodological limitations, and cost of analysis. Repre-
sentative analysis of HGT events in bacterial communities also
depends on knowledge of the structure and population dynam-
ics of the population and the sequence of the DNA transferred.
Detection strategies frequently rely on hidden or implicit assump-
tions regarding the distribution and proportion of the individual
cells in the sampled larger bacterial population that would carry
the transferred DNA sequences (Keese, 2008; Heinemann et al.,
2011).

Large-scale cultivation of genetically modiﬁed plants (GM-
plants) result in multitudinous opportunities for bacterial expo-
sure to recombinant DNA and therefore opportunities for unin-
tended horizontal dissemination of transgenes (EFSA, 2004, 2009;
Nielsen et al., 2005; Levy-Booth et al., 2007; Wögerbauer, 2007;
Pietramellara et al., 2009; Brigulla and Wackernagel, 2010). In
laboratory-settings, experimental studies of single bacterial species
have demonstrated that bacteria can take up DNA fragments from
plants and integrate them into bacterial genomes under highly
optimized conditions (e.g., Gebhard and Smalla, 1998; De Vries
et al., 2001; Kay et al., 2002; Ceccherini et al., 2003). In contrast,
in natural settings, sampling-based studies of agricultural soils,
run-off water, and GIT contents have found spread of transgenes
from GM-plants, but negative or inconclusive evidence for HGT
(Gebhard and Smalla, 1999; Netherwood et al., 2004; Mohr and
Tebbe, 2007; Demanèche et al., 2008; Douville et al., 2009).

Most research on HGT from GM-plants to bacteria has been
performed via an assay after a limited time period following
transgene exposure, perhaps in part because only limited explicit
considerations of the population dynamics of HGT events have
been presented to guide sampling design and data analysis (Heine-
mann and Traavik, 2004; Nielsen and Townsend, 2004; Nielsen
et al., 2005). Given the low mechanistic probability of occur-
rence, horizontally transferred non-mobile DNA will initially be
present at an exceedingly low frequency in the overall population.
It may therefore take months, years, or even longer for the few
initial transformants to divide and numerically out-compete non-
transformed cells of the population to reach frequencies that can
be efﬁciently detected by sampling efforts. The generation time of
bacterial populations is therefore of high importance for detection
efforts. Cell division time varies with species and environments
and can be as short as <1 h in nutrient rich environments such as
the GIT and up to several weeks in nutrient limited environments
such as soil.

The time lag between initial occurrence and potential detection
will be present even though the relevant HGT events lead to posi-
tive selection of transformants (Nielsen and Townsend, 2001, 2004;
Heinemann and Traavik, 2004; Pettersen et al., 2005). Quantify-
ing this time lag and determining the relationship between HGT
frequencies and probability of detection requires mathematical
models with dependency on several key parameters: HGT fre-
quencies, changes in relative ﬁtness of the transformants, bacterial
population sizes, and generation times in nature. A few studies
have accordingly begun to characterize the effects of natural selec-
tion and the probability of ﬁxation of HGT events in bacterial
populations (Nielsen and Townsend, 2001, 2004; Pettersen et al.,
2005).

Here we integrate previous theory into a cohesive probabilistic
framework that addresses current methodological shortcomings
in the detection of HGT events and guides experimental design of
future sampling of bacterial populations. Our analysis yields a sim-
ple formulation for the probability of detection given that a HGT
actually occurred, and facilitates computation of the statistical
power of an experimental sampling design.

N = 106–1012, and m = 10

We apply the model to four different scenarios that are relevant
for experimental monitoring of complex bacterial communities,
accounting for both the adaptive dynamics of natural selection
and the unknown timing of HGT events. In scenarios 1 and 2,
the effects of variable DNA exposure are considered (i.e., exposed
sub-population versus the total population of bacteria). Sampling
occurs at the end of the DNA exposure period. In scenarios 3 and
4, the sampling is delayed until sometime after the DNA exposure
of the bacterial recipients has ended. The total population size (N )
and the strength of selection (m) varies in the scenarios (between
−10–1). The m parameter represents
the relative cost or advantage conferred by the HGT event to the
transformant bacterium compared to untransformed members of
the same population. In nature, m values would range from the
reciprocal of the population size (weak positive selection) to near
inﬁnity (strong positive selection). The latter would for instance
be caused by antibiotic treatment leading to death of all suscep-
tible non-transformed cells. However, for most traits much lower
values of m are expected. The m value of a given trait is not a
constant and will depend on the environmental conditions. For
instance, an antibiotic resistance trait can be highly advantageous
in the presence of antibiotics (high positive m) but confer a ﬁtness
cost in the absence of antibiotics (negative m value; c.f. Johnsen
et al., 2011).

MODELING
Immediately following an HGT event into a large bacterial popu-
lation, the lineage of bacterial cells carrying the novel transferred
gene is highly vulnerable to extinction due to natural stochastic-
ity in cell survival over the ﬁrst generations (Fisher, 1922, 1930;
Haldane, 1927; Johnson and Gerrish, 2002; Pettersen et al., 2005).
Subsequently, after the transformant population has established at
higher numbers, it can be assumed to follow a fairly deterministic
path, given continued directional selection. For a selected variant
in transit to ﬁxation with Malthusian relative ﬁtness m per gen-
eration over t g generations, the current frequency p of a mutant
starting at frequency p0 can be modeled deterministically as

p
1 − p

= p0
1 − p0

emtg

(1)

(Hartl and Clark, 1997; Nielsen and Townsend, 2004). With
a single HGT event, the frequency of the transformant in a
haploid population becomes 1/N where N is the overall num-
ber of bacterial cells in the population of interest. Thus, for
the frequency of a transformant (p) subsequent to a HGT
event,

Because HGT events are relatively rare and presumably inde-
pendent, we assume that the time delay until a HGT occurs is
exponentially distributed, parameterized by a rate that incorpo-
rates the number of bacteria exposed, x, the rate of HGT per
exposed bacterium, r, and the time, tx, during which exposure may
occur (See Nielsen and Townsend, 2001 for a detailed description
of these factors). Accordingly, the time to the next HGT, Tx, would
be distributed as

(tx ) = rxe

(5)

(Kimura, 1957, 1962; Moran, 1961; Gillespie, 1974; see Patwa and
Wahl, 2008, for a review of alternate cases).

Following the exponentially distributed occurrence rate (Eq.
4), ﬁltered by the ﬁxation process (Eq. 5), the timing until the
occurrence, T, of the ﬁrst HGT that is to be eventually ﬁxed in the
population, would be distributed as

Given that an HGT occurs that is on its way to ﬁxation, what is
the probability that such a transfer will be detected? This proba-
bility depends in part on the sample size of the monitoring effort,
n. Here, n is treated as the number of bacteria in the environment
sampled in a perfect assay for possession of the HGT event. If the
frequency of the primary transformant and its offspring in the
population at a given time is p, then the probability of detection is
1 − (1 − p)n.

(7)

Because the frequency p of a HGT event/transformant that
is under strong positive selection deterministically increases with
time until it is ﬁxed in the population (Figure 1), the probability
of detection depends on the amount of time t since the ﬁrst HGT
event occurred, which depends on the time of ﬁrst exposure to
DNA of concern, T. The later the samples are taken, the greater the
probability that a selected HGT event on its way to ﬁxation will be
detected.

The probability of detection for a HGT event on its way to
ﬁxation with selection coefﬁcient m at time t g after the original
transfer event is derived by substituting Eq. 3 for p into Eq. 7
(c.f. Nielsen and Townsend, 2004). Assuming the value of Eq. 3 is
very small (i.e., population size is large and selection coefﬁcient is

sufﬁciently small), a useful approximation for the probability of
detection of a HGT event on its way to ﬁxation is

However, for practical implementation, the probability term
from Eq. 3 may not be known to be small. Furthermore, the
unknown timing of the successful HGT is a key factor in the prob-
ability of detection. Therefore it would be best to integrate over all
possible timings in order to calculate a representative probability

of detection of HGT events. Noting that in this case t g = t s − t,
this integration, from Eqs 4, 5, and 8, is

Equation 10 yields a prediction of the probability of occurrence
and detection of a HGT event, and may be parameterized across a
range of rates of HGT.

For experimental design purposes (or for prediction for pol-
icy purposes), it may be important to calculate not just the full
probability of detection, but also the restricted, higher probability
of detection given that a successful HGT has occurred. This cal-
culation can be achieved by dividing the result of Eq. 10 by the
probability of any successful HGT event over the time tx,

FIGURE 1 | Scenario 1: HGT in large populations, no sampling
delay; weak positive selection. Probabilities of detection of
transformants in a large bacterial population N = 1012 with HGT rates
ranging from r = 10−14 to 10−5, and weak positive selection of
transformants ranging from m = 10−10 to 10−3. The proportion of DNA

exposed bacteria is low, medium and high (x = 106, 108, and 1010,
respectively, out of the 1012 total bacterial population, from top to
bottom), and the time period of DNA exposure is the same as the
time to sampling: tx = t s= 20, 103, and 105, from left to right. Sample
size n = 10,000 bacteria.

ranged from 106 (small) to 1012 (large). We assume only a frac-
tion of the bacterial population that was sampled was exposed to
novel genetic material (0.0001–1% in large populations, and 0.1–
10% in small populations); resulting in HGT rates (and hence,
−5. Moreover, as
transformant rates) ranging from 10
explained above, we considered only transformants that have rel-
ative ﬁtness gains, as expressed by a positive selection coefﬁcient,
including weak positive selection (m = 10
−3) or strong
positive selection (m = 10
−3–1). Our analysis excludes secondary
transmissions, a process that may need explicit consideration in
cases of plasmid transfer (Landis et al., 2000).

−10–10

Four different environmental scenarios were examined that
broadly represent the population dynamics of HGT events in bac-
terial populations. The scenarios encompassed: (i) large and small
bacterial populations, (ii) strong and weak selection of the HGT
events (transformants), and (iii) immediate or delayed sampling,
i.e., if the sampling of the larger bacterial population was per-
formed at the end of the DNA exposure, or delayed in time until
long after the DNA exposure had ended. Within these scenarios, we
varied the HGT rate, the selection coefﬁcient, the ratio of exposed
to total population of bacteria, the time period of exposure, and
the time until the bacteria was sampled in the ﬁeld (Table 1).

Since approx. 10,000 bacteria represents the upper limit of the
number of individual isolates that can be practically assayed in
a research laboratory (Nielsen and Townsend, 2004), we assume
this sample size (n = 10,000) for all our scenario calculations, even
though effective sample sizes in actual studies to date have been

smaller. In scenarios where several samples were taken from a
ﬁeld at several time points, sample size will be proportionally
reduced at each sampling point. This ensures comparability among
experimental designs.

In scenarios 1 and 2, the focus is on the effects of variable DNA
exposure level (exposed sub-population versus the total popula-
tion of bacteria) and on the strength of selection. We keep the
time span of exposure equal to the time span before sampling, i.e.,

sampling occurs at the end of the DNA exposure (i.e., tx = t s).

In scenarios 3 and 4, the sampling is delayed for considerable
amounts of time after the DNA exposure of the bacterial recipients
has ended (i.e., tx < t s).

All calculations were performed and graphics were drawn in
the Mathematica 4.1 software (Wolfram Research, IL, USA). The
Mathematica notebook containing these calculations is available
in the Appendix.

RESULTS
SCENARIO 1. DETECTION OF BACTERIAL TRANSFORMANTS IN LARGE
POPULATIONS
Scenario 1 represents a large bacterial population (e.g., abundant
members of the soil bacterial community or the GIT of an ani-
mal population). Of the total population, only a sub-fraction of
0.0001, 0.01, and 1% is actually exposed to DNA (e.g., due to lim-
ited release/exposure of DNA from the deﬁned source and or DNA
degradation in soil or the GIT; Nielsen et al., 2007; Nordgård et al.,
2007; Rizzi et al., 2012). Those bacteria exposed can acquire DNA

Selection (m)

FIGURE 2 | Scenario 1: HGT in large populations, no sampling
delay; strong positive selection. Probability of detection of
transformants in a large bacterial population, N = 1012, with a HGT rate
ranging from r = 10−14 to 10−5, and strong positive selection on
transformants ranging from m = 10−3 to 1. The number of bacteria

exposed to DNA is low, medium, and high (x = 106, 108, and 1010,
respectively, out of the 1012 total bacterial population, from top to
bottom), and the time period of DNA exposure is the same as time to
sampling: tx = t s= 20, 102, and 103, from left to right. Sample size
n = 10,000 bacteria.

at rates ranging from extremely low (below what is usually exper-
imentally measurable in the laboratory) to very high. Detection is
likely only when sampling was performed after a long period of
exposure (Figures 1 and 2). The strength of directional selection

is of considerable importance. However the determining factor is
time of sampling after onset of exposure. To achieve a 90% or
greater probability of detection, given that transfer has occurred,
requires a selection coefﬁcient greater than m= 10
−4 (Figure 1).

Quantitative approaches to detecting HGT

This observation suggests a time interval from the onset of a DNA
exposure, until detection is possible, of 11 years in the GIT to up
to 3,000 years in soil and (given 105 bacterial generations, with
generation times of 1 h to 2 weeks, respectively). Figures 1 and 2
illustrate that an increase in the proportion of exposed bacteria is
of little importance when compared to prolonging the time period
of DNA exposure and sampling. Given enough time, even weakly
but positively selected HGT events (e.g., antibiotic resistance gene
or transgene) resulting from DNA exposure to only a small frac-
tion of the total population and with a low HGT rate, is likely to
establish in the bacterial population.

soil or GIT bacteria by seasonal crop cultivation or consump-
tion patterns). We examined large populations (N= 1012) only,
and applied different parameter values for the weak and strong
selection scenarios. For the weak positive selection scenario, the
exposure time was 100 generations, the exposed population was
of size n = 108 and the time lag before sampling ranged from 104
to 105 generations). For the strong selection scenario, the DNA
exposure time was extremely short (20 bacterial generations), the
exposed population was 106, and the time lag before sampling
ranged from none (i.e., sampling at the end of exposure), 30
bacterial generations, or 80 bacterial generations later.

SCENARIO 2. DETECTION OF BACTERIAL TRANSFORMANTS IN SMALL
POPULATIONS
Scenario 2 considers a small bacterial population. Such a scenario
can be representative of ﬂuctuating colonization or infection pat-
terns such as microcolonies on plant, skin, or soil surfaces (e.g.,
Kinkel et al., 1995; Morris et al., 1997; Monier and Lindow, 2004),
or alternatively situations where only a subset of the species/strains
in the overall DNA exposed microbial community are capable of
acquiring DNA. In this scenario, a sub-fraction of 0.001, 0.1, and
10% of the overall capable population is exposed to DNA and
can acquire DNA at rates ranging from extremely low to high
frequencies (r = 10

−14–10

−5).

When selection is weak, the HGT events and, hence, resulting
transformants, are likely to be detected only after relatively long
exposure times, i.e., more than 1,000 generations, and only when
the fraction of exposed bacteria is about 0.1% or higher (Figure 3).
In situations where positive selection is stronger, the HGT event
is detectable in the short-term, i.e., after 20 generations, given
that the fraction of bacteria that are exposed is high (Figure 4,
bottom panel). A combination of an intermediate fraction of bac-
teria exposed (0.1%) and an intermediate time for DNA exposure
(1,000 generations) gives a relatively high probability of detecting
HGT events (Figure 4, middle panel). Even in cases where the
fraction of bacteria exposed to the DNA is very low, long-term
exposure (tx > 105 generations) and strong positive selection will
lead to establishment of transformants, i.e., at detectable levels
(Figure 4, upper panel). Our longest generation time examined,
105, represents a continual exposure period of 10 years (with a bac-
terial division time of 1 h or less) to more than 3,000 years (with a
bacterial division time of 11 days or more).

THE EFFECT OF DELAYED SAMPLING AFTER SHORT-TERM TRANSIENT
EXPOSURE TO DNA
In the following scenarios (three and four, weak and strong selec-
tion, respectively), the bacteria are exposed to DNA for only a
short period of time (20–100 generations, e.g., representing a time
period of a less than a day to a few years, depending on bacter-
ial growth rate). In all cases, the bacterial population is sampled
after exposure. That is, a time delay before sampling is intro-
duced after the end of the exposure period that provides additional
time for directional selection (of a range of intensities) to act on
the transformed cells. These scenarios illustrate situations where
the sampled microbial community (e.g., agricultural soil, GIT) is
only temporarily exposed to the DNA source in question (e.g.,

−10–10

SCENARIO 3. DELAYED SAMPLING – LARGE POPULATIONS AND WEAK
POSITIVE SELECTION
In situations where potential transformants experience only weak
−3), with 0.01% of the bacterial pop-
positive selection (10
ulation exposed to DNA, and an exposure time of 100 generations,
no HGT events could be detected either at the end of the exposure
or after a delayed sampling (104 generations after DNA expo-
sure; Figure 5, left). However, a further 5- to 10-fold increase
in the time delay before sampling (to 5× 104 and 105 genera-
tions) yielded increasing probabilities of detecting the HGT events
(Figure 5, middle and right). Thus, theoretically, in environmen-
tal situations where the bacterial generation time is very short
(e.g., in a mammalian gut system), HGT events arising from lim-
ited, transient DNA exposure can be detected, providing they are
positively selected and have had the necessary time to increase
in relative numbers within the overall population. However, even
the most rapidly dividing bacterial populations would need more
than 10 years to comprise 5× 104 and 105 generations (the 10-
year ﬁgure would assume a bacterial division time of 30 min).
Supposing this scenario represented an environment with inter-
mittent antibiotic treatments, the effect of the length of the time
period before transformants become detectable would be sen-
sitive to any inconstancy of selection. The time period before
the transformant population either increases in proportion to
detectability or is lost from the population would therefore be
different, and typically longer, in a situation with more variable
selection dynamics.

SCENARIO 4. DELAYED SAMPLING – LARGE POPULATIONS AND
STRONG SELECTION
Under strong positive selection, even HGT events occurring as a
consequence of exposure of a very low overall proportion of the
population (here 0.0001%) over a short period of time (t = 20
generations) can be detected (Figure 6). The time of sampling
nevertheless remains a signiﬁcant factor in the probability of detec-
tion. Sampling at the end of the exposure (T = 20) yields a low
probability of detection (Figure 6, left). In contrast, introducing
a time lag before sampling, here 30 and 80 generations after the
end of exposure (T = 50 and 100, respectively), results in a sharp
increase in the likelihood of detection (Figure 6, middle and right).
The starkness of this result may at ﬁrst seem surprising; however
positive selection that increases the frequency of the transformed
bacteria is the main characteristic that makes detection possi-
ble; other factors in this scenario are of negligible importance.
Strong directional selection makes such HGT events less affected

strongly beneﬁcial mutations (Barret et al., 2006).

APPLICATION TO GMP–HGT MONITORING STUDIES
Application of the model presented here to sampling parame-
ters derived from published ﬁeld monitoring studies of bacterial
populations exposed to GMPs shows limited potential to recover
HGT events, had they occurred (Figure 7). Only transgenes con-
ferring strong positive selection coefﬁcients (approx. m = 0.09 or
higher) are likely to be detected with high probability by sampling
of microbial communities with limited exposure to the GM-plant
material (over 365 generations, representing 1 year of exposure).
In contrast, HGT of transgenes conferring 10-fold weaker positive
selection coefﬁcients (m = 0.009) can be detected with reasonable
probability after limited sampling of microbial communities given
a 10-fold longer exposure.

The 10-year long exposure period in a ﬁeld-based monitoring
study by Demanèche et al. (2008) represented the longest expo-
sure period before HGT assay to date. Demanèche and colleagues
in France examined samples from agricultural sites that had been
cultivated with a GM maize variety over a 10 years time period. In
addition, soil samples taken from a conventional ﬁeld and pasture
were included (three sample types) in the analyses. The GM maize
variety (event Bt-176) harbored the blaTEM-116 allele, conferring

bacterial resistance to certain beta-lactam antibiotics. The out-
come of the study was that a range of TEM-type alleles could be
found in soil samples taken both from GM and non-GM, conven-
tional sites. The study recovered up to 2.5× 105 culturable bacteria
per gram soil sample and reported up to 6.5% of the ampicillin
resistance among the culturable fraction.

A total of 576 resistant colonies were further analyzed with
PCR targeted toward blaTEM. Of the 576 ampliﬁcations performed
on samples from the three different ﬁeld types, 505 were TEM-
positive, representing 87.7% of the resistant fraction. DNA of 80
of the 505 TEM-positive samples was sequenced. Of these, 10 were
found to represent the blaTEM-116 allele that is also present in the
GM maize event Bt -176. However, only 4 out of the 10 positive
samples originated from the soils cultivated with the transgene.
Thus, the authors concluded that the resistance gene was already
prevalent in soil and that there was no evidence for horizontal
dissemination from the GM-plant variety over the 10-year time
period. In Figure 7, we assume a sample size of 192 (1/3rd of
the 576 resistant samples analyzed by PCR) and a bacterial gen-
eration time of one per day (3,650 generations). It is noted that
bacterial generation time will vary according to species and strain,
as well to seasonal and tempo-spatial effects in soil. Application
of our model to the study of Demanèche et al. (2008) suggests
that HGT events with m values as low as 0.009 can be detected
with at least 90% probability. At these weak levels of selection, the
key factor determining the detection probability is the number of
bacterial generations, in this case assumed to be 1 per day. Increas-
ing the sample size above n = 192 would have little effect on the
probability of detection.

DISCUSSION
We have presented a probabilistic framework for detection of
initially rare HGT events/transformants by sampling of larger bac-
terial populations. This result expands on earlier studies (Nielsen
and Townsend, 2001, 2004; Pettersen et al., 2005) to derive a quan-
titative approach for analysis of the time scale over which HGT
events take place and can be detected. Our population genetic
framework facilitates practical implementation as well as a more
detailed examination of the relative role of the key factors deter-
mining the fate of horizontally acquired genes in bacterial popu-
lations. The utility of the quantitative approach presented here is,
although dependent on some knowledge of the rates of the relevant
processes, independent of the speciﬁc mechanism of HGT (e.g.,
transduction, conjugation, transformation). The model is there-
fore equally applicable to understanding HGT processes between
bacterial species/strains/cells as it is applicable to HGT events
occurring between unrelated species. Quantitative adjustments
to the DNA exposure and HGT rate can accommodate diverse
mechanisms. Furthermore, the model identiﬁes parameter values
that should guide further hypothesis formation and experimental
design.

SELECTION
The design of sampling approaches aimed at detecting rare HGT
processes is deeply challenging, because the fundamental task is to
detect a very low probability event with a very small sample size
in a very large population. Field studies over limited time periods

are correspondingly not likely to identify rare HGT events in large
and complex bacterial communities (Figure 7). The detection of
HGT events is therefore most often feasible only if the few ini-
tial transformants have a growth advantage so they increase their
relative proportion in the overall population. However, there are
methodological challenges to the implementation of deﬁned selec-
tive conditions at the DNA exposure stage when rare transformants
arise.

In laboratory systems, the use of antibiotics at concentrations
below the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) can possibly
apply such directional selection, and hence enrichment of rare
transformants present in large, complex microbial communities.
However, it is a non-trivial problem to experimentally achieve
sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics that confer directional
selection of rare transformants without simultaneously limiting
the viability of the overall bacterial population.

In ﬁeld systems, directional selection and enrichment of
initially rare transformants will depend on the prevailing
environmental conditions. There are usually few opportuni-
ties to introduce directional selection with controlled selection
coefﬁcients.

As exempliﬁed in this study, directional selection typically dom-
inates determination of the probability of detection. Strong sam-
pling designs would therefore avoid focus on the detection of the
initial HGT events (and associated HGT frequencies), but rather
attempt to detect positively selected descendants of the primary
transformants. A shift in focus to the detection of descendants
precludes precise determination of HGT frequencies. However,
frequencies are poor predictors of the short and long-term (evo-
lutionary) impact of HGT events. As long as such events occur
repeatedly, other factors will determine the biological impact of
these events (Pettersen et al., 2005).

Our calculations are based on a ﬁxed selection coefﬁcient m.
However, the strength of selection will frequently ﬂuctuate over
space and time due to environmental variables, as well as variability
among bacterial genotypes attributable to gene-by-environment
interactions (Kimura, 1954; Barker and Butcher, 1966). Thus,
selection coefﬁcients will be inexact and will rarely be amenable to
robust quantiﬁcation over variable environments. Furthermore,
the genome of a given bacterial transformant will be exposed to
other HGT events and mutational processes that may change the
initial beneﬁcial ﬁtness effects of a given HGT event (Lenski et al.,
1991; Gerrish, 2001; Heffernan and Wahl, 2002; Rozen et al., 2002;
Barret et al., 2006; Johnsen et al., 2011).

In practice, host and environmental variation prevents precise
and meaningful quantiﬁcation of m values. Theoretical modeling
approaches, however, offer the opportunity to examine the effects
of broad ranges of m, therefore providing opportunities to identify
threshold values and to predict the dynamics of rare HGT events
in larger bacterial populations.

FIXATION
Our approach quantiﬁes detection of HGTs that are on their way
to ﬁxation (Kimura, 1962), whereas the biological importance
of HGT events arises at population proportions much less than
one. For instance, the prevalence of a pathogenic strain carry-
ing an HGT event encoding antibiotic resistance is of highest

interest when its relative proportion among sensitive strains is
<0.1–0.3; as higher proportions will lead to changes in clinical
prescription guidance for ﬁrst line antibiotic therapy (Daneman
et al., 2008). Random or seasonal variations in local population
sizes may also cause particular genotypes (e.g., transformants)
to ﬂuctuate at low frequencies above or below detection for
long periods of time (Gerrish and Lenski, 1998). Genetic drift
and uneven survival rates in structured bacterial populations
are important in determining the fate of transformants (Hef-
fernan and Wahl, 2002; Pettersen et al., 2005). The event of key
importance is therefore when the transformant proportion rises
to the point where subsequent evolution is largely deterministic
based on the current level of directional selection (Rouzine et al.,
2001).

The probability of ﬁxation of a transformant by genetic drift
alone is governed by the inverse of population size. Given geo-
graphically dispersed and large population sizes, the ﬁxation of a
horizontally acquired gene/transgene in a bacterial population has
been viewed as unlikely (Berg and Kurland, 2002). However, see
also views by Majewski and Cohan (1999), Cohan (2002, 2005),
and Novozhilov et al. (2005). The likelihood of ﬁxation of a neutral
HGT event may differ from the likelihood of ﬁxation of a neutral
mutation; this is because mutations occur routinely and repeat-
edly in large bacterial populations, whereas HGT events may be
much more tempo-spatially variable.

SPATIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Although our model accounts for the effects of natural selection
over time, it contains no inherent spatial component. Samples
should be collected with consideration that rare horizontal trans-
fers are not expected to occur and be distributed evenly in large,
structured bacterial populations. Similarly, antibiotic resistance
genes or transgenes are likely to be initially present only in a lim-
ited number of patches (e.g., patients/hospitals, or soil sites/ﬁelds);
representing metapopulations of the larger global population
(Maynard Smith et al., 2000). Initial frequencies will match their
occurrence, but subsequent frequencies will correspond to the out-
come of spatially variable directional selection and genetic drift.
Migration between patches may also be of variable intensity and
directionality. Uneven distribution patterns need to be considered
in the sampling design.

FIELD MONITORING
The analyses of published GMP ﬁeld monitoring studies (Figure 7)
indicated that detection of HGT events could only be achieved
under circumstances of strong positive selection of the hypothe-
sized transformants. Selection coefﬁcients as high as m = 0.05, by
evolutionary genetic standards, represent an extraordinary adap-
tive event. In the laboratory, selection coefﬁcients as small as
m = 0.01 can be measured, and over evolutionary time, selection
coefﬁcients as small as the inverse of the effective population size
−10 bacteria per gram sample)
(here, this would be as small as 10
are of importance in determining the genome composition of
organisms. The retrospective analyses of these studies also sug-
gest that increasing the sample size massively does little to increase
the probability of detecting a HGT event that has occurred. How-
ever, increasing the delay between exposure and testing permits

detection of HGT events characterized by much lower selection
coefﬁcients.

Most of the ﬁeld sampling-based HGT studies published so
far have been based on a number of implicit assumptions on the
characteristics of the biological system investigated. A more formal
theoretical analysis of the population genetic aspects of the system
investigated will contribute to make these assumptions explicit;
and therefore provide improved clarity and robustness to future
experimental design. The model presented here aims to provide
guidance on future ﬁeld-based sampling incorporating key pop-
ulation genetic factors. The multiple levels of, and importance
of population genetic considerations in understanding horizon-
tal gene ﬂow have recently been reviewed by Baquero and Coque,
2011, and references within) and Zur Wiesch et al. (2011).

CLINICAL SETTINGS
The Research topic for this particular issue of the journal is on
resistance genes in the open environment, not in clinical settings.
The practical scenarios examined in this study are therefore taken
from non-clinical environments. However, the general insight of
the presented study is also conceptually relevant to the general
aspects of the population genetics of horizontal gene ﬂow in clini-
cal environments. This generality arises because, as we indicate in
the Section “Discussion,” the model design does not rely on a given
DNA transfer mechanism or particular environmental conditions.
Our model examines the relationship between the four essential
components determining the fate of initially rare HGT events in
larger populations: (exposed) population size, HGT rates, bacter-
ial generation time and selective advantage. These four population
parameters are essential to the fate of HGT events occurring both
in clinical settings among pathogens, as well as in non-clinical set-
tings among non-pathogens. Despite the general insight to clinical
scenarios that our model might provide, certain characteristics
of the lifestyle of clinical pathogenic populations render spe-
ciﬁc calculations based on our model to be inappropriate. These
characteristics include:

1. Exceptionally strong selective environments are caused by the
use of high doses of antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infec-
tions. An acquisition of a resistance gene under antibiotic treat-
ment is exceptionally advantageous, as, 100% of the susceptible
population is likely to die. Thus, the relative growth advantage
is immense, leading to very rapid population expansion of the
transformant population and the absence of competitors. Such
strong positive selection is not comparable to the much weaker
levels of positive selection for most other traits in non-clinical
environments. Moreover, clinical antibiotic usage is also highly
time-limited, producing strong ﬂuctuations in the selection for
a given resistance trait over time, that would require dynamic
epidemiological modeling. We assume constant selection over
time in our model.

2. The infectious lifestyle of some pathogens leads to exception-
ally rapid changes in their population sizes (during infec-
tions) followed by strong bottlenecks (during transmission).
Thus, depending on the pathogen in question, the trans-
formed cells may or may not be competing with non-
transformed members of their populations. Thus, the ﬁtness

effects may have a different context in clinical environments
depending on the characteristics of the infectious pathogen in
question.

The infection pattern of the pathogen in question will also
determine its initial population size N, a value that would be very
low for a strict pathogen (e.g., tuberculosis) but perhaps initially
somewhat larger for opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Clostridium
difﬁcile). However, our model assumes a more stable environ-
ment with a constant large population size, and is based on a
competitive growth advantage of the transformant (relative to
non-transformed members of the same populations; present in
the same environment). This growth advantage will materialize as
higher cell division rates for the transformant; the rate difference
expressed through the m (Malthusian ﬁtness parameter) value.
Thus, a materialized growth advantage requires the presence of a
much larger non-transformed population.

In summary, our model is not designed to capture the intense
short-term positive selection, population expansions (infections),
coupled with bottlenecks (insufﬁcient antibiotic treatment, and
or transmission of a few bacteria to the next patient) that lead
to different ranges of population genetic parameters and other
model assumptions. From our point of view, such characteris-

tics cannot be included in our model without addressing the
etiology of infections and resistance patterns of individual path-
ogenic strains. Such developments are of high interest for further
work.

From the application of our model in the examination of var-
ious environmental scenarios, cases and literature examples, it
can be concluded that some interspecies HGT is likely to occur
over time and spatial scales not amenable to direct experimental
observation. The model suggests sampling-based detection of the
descendants (offspring) of the initial transformants is achievable;
emphasizing that the probability of detection can only correspond
to a calculable level of selection, and that a powerful experimental
design requires a delayed sampling strategy.

The recent publications by Gallet et al. (2012) and Toprak et al.
(2012) present innovative laboratory approaches for quantiﬁca-
tion of weak positive selection, or for selection of initially rare but
positively selected bacterial phenotypes.
