Abstract:  Respiratory  syncytial  virus  (RSV)  is  one  of  the  most  important  pathogen  causing  severe  lower  respiratory  
tract infections in all age groups often requiring hospitalization. Rapid laboratory diagnosis of RSV infection significantly 
decreases  the  use  of  antibiotics,  additional  laboratory  testing  and  is  associated  with  shorter  hospitalization  periods.  
The specific diagnosis of RSV infection is based on the detection of virus or viral antigens or virus specific nucleic acid 
sequences  in respiratory  secretions. The kind  and quality of the  clinical  specimen exerts a  considerable influence on the 
results of all currently used viral detection assays. Antigen based tests are widely available, easy to perform and the results 
are  available  in  a  short  time  but  their  reduced  sensitivity  and  specificity  represent  a  considerable  shortcoming.  Among  
the methods available isolation in cell culture was considered the gold standard for the sensitive identification of RSV but 
is gradually replaced by highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification assays that provide more rapid results. Of 
these reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was the first and is still the most frequently used nucleic acid- 
based assay. New methodologies, as for example the real-time PCR methods allow the quantification of viral nucleic acids 
in the clinical sample. Disadvantages of the nucleic acid based assays are their high costs and their limited standardization. 

Future research on new methodologies for the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections should focus on the develop-
ment  of  sensitive,  rapid  and  cost  effective  test  systems  allowing  the  screening  for  all  probable  causative  agents.  In  
addition varying testing protocols for summer  and winter  months  based on epidemiologic data are needed to direct  their 
practical use.

INTRODUCTION 

  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)  is one of the most im-
portant  respiratory  pathogens,  causing  severe  infections  of 
the lower respiratory tract  in infants, small children, the  eld-
erly, and in immunosuppressed patients, often requiring hos-
pitalization [1-7]. RSV is highly contagious and gives rise to 
yearly epidemic outbreaks of respiratory tract infections dur-
ing  the  late  fall,  winter  and  early  spring  with  only  sporadic 
cases detected year round [1, 8-10] (Fig. 1).  

  Almost  all  children  have  serologic  evidence  of  RSV  in-
fection  by  2  years  of  age.  Primary  RSV  infection  is  rarely 
asymptomatic  and  the  peak  period  of  serious  illness  due  to 
RSV  is  during  the  first  few  months  of  life  with  average  an-
nual  hospitalization  rates  of  17  per  1000  children  under  6 
months of age and 3 per 1000 children under 5 years of age 
[12]. Underlying conditions, most frequently premature birth 
or  cardiopulmonary  disease  are  additional  risk  factors  for 
severe  RSV  disease  requiring  hospitalization  [13,  14].  In 
addition,  previous  RSV  infections  do  not  confer  protection 
and  reinfections  throughout  life  are  very  common  [15,  16]. 
Despite an increasing number of newly identified respiratory

viruses,  RSV  remains  the  most  important  etiologic  agent  in 
infants below two years of age hospitalized with acute respi-
ratory tract infection (Fig. 2). 

  Due  to  the  high  number  of  potential  pathogens  that  may 
cause  similar  symptoms  of  respiratory  illness,  clinical  char-
acteristics  are  rarely  distinctive  enough  to  accurately  dis-
criminate  RSV-related  from  other,  non-RSV-related  respira-
tory  tract  infections  [18,  19].  Laboratory  confirmation  of 
clinically  suspected  RSV  infection generally depends on the 
detection of the virus in respiratory secretions of the patient. 
Immunofluorescent  staining  of  viral  antigens  in  respiratory 
epithelial cells, introduced by Philipp Gardner in the 1970ies 
[20,  21]  was  the  first  specific  rapid  diagnostic  test.  Since 
then  rapid,  sensitive  and  specific  diagnostic  tools  have  been 
developed  and  their  increasing  availability  and  use  unveiled 
the  prominent  role  of  RSV  in  lower  respiratory  tract  infec-
tion  in  childhood  and  the  strong  association  of  RSV  bron-
chiolitis  in infancy and wheezing in later childhood [22-24]. 
The  following  article  will  provide  a  short  review  on  the  di-
agnostic  value,  the  advantages  and  limitations  of  the  most 
currently used techniques for RSV diagnosis.  

Clinical Manifestations 

  RSV  infection  is  associated  with  a  variety  of  clinical 
manifestations  ranging  from  mild  cold-like  symptoms  to 
severe  lower respiratory tract  illness  with significant wheez-
ing,  breathing  difficulty,  cyanosis  and  possibly  apnoeic  epi-

sodes. Between 25% and 40% of children develop symptoms 
of  bronchiolitis  or  pneumonia  during  their  primary  RSV  in-
fection  [25-28].  In  addition  to  the  more  common  symptoms 
of lower respiratory tract infection a variety of extrapulmon-
ary  manifestations,  ranging  from  cardiac  involvement  to  
sepsis-like  syndrome  have  been  observed  in  children  with 
severe  RSV  disease  [29,  30],  but  whether  they  represent  
direct or indirect effects of the virus is unclear. In premature 
infants  RSV  infection  is  frequently  atypical  in  its  clinical 
presentation  and  may  manifest  as  apnoea,  bradycardia,  or 
changes in feeding and ventilation [13, 31].  

Reasons for RSV Testing 

  Rapid laboratory confirmation of RSV infection results in 
a  reduced  number  of  ancillary  tests,  a  decrease  in  antibiotic 
use  and  shorter  hospitalization  periods  in  clinical  paediatric 
practice  [32,  33].  Laboratory  diagnosis  is  also  required  for 
children with atypical  clinical presentations, such as respira-
tory distress or sepsis like syndrome and in premature infants 
with non-specific signs in order to rule out another cause and 
to  avoid  delayed  diagnosis.  As  RSV  is  highly  contagious, 
rapid identification of RSV infected infants in hospital wards 
is of utmost importance in order to initiate appropriate infec-

tion  control precautions  to prevent nosocomial outbreaks [4, 
13, 34]. Viral testing using rapid and sensitive assays for the 
detection  of  RSV  are  also  required  to  take  the  offensive  for 
preventive  programs  and  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  antiviral 
prophylaxis  [35,  36].  Other  reasons  for  viral  testing  exist, 
such  as  for  research  and  epidemiologic  monitoring  of  RSV 
activity. 

Laboratory Diagnosis 

  The  specific  diagnosis  of  RSV  infection  is  made  by  the 
detection  of  the  virus  or  viral  antigens  or  virus  specific  nu-
cleic  acid  sequences  in  respiratory  secretions.  The  kind  and 
quality  of  the  clinical  specimen  exerts  a  considerable  influ-
ence  on  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  all  viral  detection 
assays  currently  available.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  a 
nasal wash or a nasopharyngeal aspirate is more sensitive for 
the  detection  of  RSV  than  a  nasopharyngeal  swab  specimen 
[37, 38]. However the collection of a nasopharyngeal swab is 
far  less  unpleasant  for  the  patient,  does  not  require  special-
ized equipment, and  can  also be performed  in an out-patient 
setting. Using the recently designed flocked-nasopharyngeal-
swabs,  which  effectively  dislodge  and  collect  virus  infected 
cells  lining  the  nasopharynx  greatly  improves  the  quality  of

swab  specimens  and  significantly  increases  the  diagnostic 
yield of this clinical specimen [39-42]. 

  Laboratory  methods  currently  available  for  the  detection 
of RSV  include virus  isolation in  tissue  culture, detection of 
viral  antigens  by  direct  or  indirect  immunofluorescent  (IF) 
staining  (DFA/IFA)  or  by  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent 
assays  (EIAs)  and  the  detection  of  viral  nucleic  acids  by  
amplification  assays,  predominantly  reverse  transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 

Virus Isolation in Tissue Culture  

 
Isolation  of  RSV  in  tissue  culture  was  considered  as  the 
gold  standard  for  confirmation  of  presumed  RSV  infection 
for quite  a  long period of time. However besides  the  techni-
cal  expertise  in  appropriate  specimen  handling  for  efficient 
virus  recovery,  this  technique  requires  an  average  of  3  to  6 
days until syncytial cytopathic effect appears. Shell vial cen-
trifugation  cultures  followed  by  DFA  or  immunoperoxidase 
staining  using  virus  specific  monoclonal  antibodies  signifi-
cantly increases the sensitivity of the tissue culture technique 
and shortens the turnaround time for virus identification to 1 
to 2 days [43-45]. 

  The  advantage  of  the  tissue  culture  technique  is  that  it  
is  more  sensitive  than  rapid  antigen  detection  kits  and  that  
it  provides  the  ability  of  further  antigenic  and  genetic  

characterization of the amplified virus which can be used for 
the  screening  of  epidemiological  relevant  mutations  or  for 
the  confirmation  of  nosocomial  transmission  by  sequence 
analysis [46-48].  

Antigen Detection 

  Antigen  detection  assays  include  direct  immunofluores-
cence  assays  (DFA),  enzyme  immunosorbent  assays  (EIA), 
chromatographic  and  optical  immunoassays  [49-54].  The 
DFA  uses  fluorescein-labelled  antibodies  that  detect  RSV 
antigen  in  epithelial  cells  in  respiratory  secretions  and  has 
the  advantage  that  the  immunofluorescence  pattern  of  the 
infected cells can be directly examined by microscopy which 
provides  additional  confirmation  of  specificity.  In  the  EIA, 
RSV  antigen,  if  present,  is  captured  by  RSV-specific  anti-
bodies and will be detected by a second enzyme-linked anti-
body. Antigen detection kits are easy  to perform and  the re-
sults are available in a short time. For these reasons they are 
widely  used  in  clinical  practice.  Currently  available  antigen 
detection kits in paediatric specimens have sensitivities of 72 
to  94%  and  specificities  of  95  to  100%  as  compared  to  cell 
culture  (Table  1).  However,  in  older  children  and  adults, 
detection  rates  for  EIA  are  extremely  low  with  sensitivities 
of 0 to 20% (Tables 1 and 2), most likely because of the sub-
stantially  lower  viral  titre  and  shorter  virus  shedding  in  a 
group  of  patients  experiencing  RSV  reinfections  [55].  The

specificity  of  antigen  detection  kits  may  be  significantly  re-
duced, especially if used outside the epidemic periods, when 
the  prevalence  of  the  virus  in  the  community  is  low  and  the 
rate of false positive results becomes relatively high [56-60]. 
Although  numerous  efforts  are  undertaken  to  improve  the 
sensitivity  and  specificity  of  antigen  detection  kits,  methods 
are  less  specific  and  far  less  sensitive  than  nucleic  acid  
amplification assays [61-63]. 

Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs) 

  Nucleic  acid  assays  have  revolutionized  the  diagnostic 
procedures  in  virology  and  are  the  most  sensitive  and  spe-
cific  methods  for  the  detection  of  RSV,  regardless  of  the 
patient  population  tested  [58,  64-69].  Studies  comparing 
molecular  diagnostic  assays  to  virus  isolation  in  cell  culture 
and  to  antigen  detection  assays  have  demonstrated  superior 
sensitivity  for  nucleic  acid  tests  [62,  63,  70-73]  (Table  2) 
which  leads  to  an  approximately  twofold  increase  of  detec-
tion  rates  in  infants  with  respiratory  illness  [71,  74].  Young 
children  experiencing  primary  infection  usually  shed  large 
quantities of RSV over a prolonged period of time. With the 
increasing  number  of  subsequent  infections,  virus  is  shed  in 
lower quantities for shorter times [75] due to the presence of 
secretory  and  humoral  virus-specific  antibodies  influencing 
the  degree  of  viral  replication  [76].  Therefore  a  decrease  in 
the efficacy of  RSV detection with  increasing age of  the pa-
tient has been reported in various studies [50, 56, 57, 70, 77-79]. 
Nevertheless  molecular  diagnostic  assays  are  definitely  also 
more  sensitive  for  older  age  groups  as  a  result  of  the  lower 
virus production in these patients (Table 2, Fig. 3). 

  Of  the  different  nucleic  acid  amplification  techniques, 
reverse  transcription  polymerase  chain  reaction  (RT-PCR) 
was  the  first  and  most  frequently  used  nucleic  acid-based 
assay [80-82]. In  the  last  ten years, numerous  in-house PCR 
protocols  have  been  published  for  amplifying  various  gene 
segments  of  the  RSV  genome  [70,  83-87]  and,  in  addition, 
an increasing number of commercial RSV NAT kits are now 
available.  

  New  PCR  techniques,  as  for  example  the  real-time  PCR 
methods,  have  been  developed.  Real-time  PCR  assays  that 

use  fluorescent  probes  such  as  Taqman,  molecular  beacons 
and scorpion probes enable the simultaneous performance of 
amplification  and  detection  and  result  in  a  considerable  in-
crease  in  the  speed  of  RT-PCR  with  a  turnaround  time  of  a 
few hours. Protocols have  also been designed for simultane-
ous  amplification  of  RSV  together  with  various  other  respi-
ratory viruses which cause similar clinical  symptoms.  These 
multiplex PCR assays are able to identify a variety of differ-
ent respiratory viruses simultaneously, either within a single 
tube  or  by  parallel  detection  in  a  single  PCR  run.  Using 
highly sensitive monoplex or multiplex PCR assays, it turned 
out  that  a  significant  proportion  of  up  to  10-30%  of respira-
tory illness cases and up to 50% of RSV-infections in infants 
represent  mixed  infections  of  2  or  more  respiratory  viruses 
[17,  24,  74,  88-90]  (Fig.  2).  The  impact  of  a  coinfection  on 
the  clinical  course  of  illness  still  remains  controversial.  A 
significantly  increased  risk  of  more  severe  disease  or  of  ad-
mission  to  a  paediatric  intensive  care  unit  has  been  reported 
for dual as compared to single respiratory virus detection by 
some [91-93], but not by other studies [17, 74]. 

  An  important  benefit  of  real-time  PCR  is  that  it  allows 
quantification of viral nucleic  acids present in a  sample [66, 
77]. The diagnostic value of the determination of viral loads 
in respiratory tract infections is still unclear, because respira-
tory  specimens  are  difficult  to  standardize,  especially  with 
regard  to  the  amount  of  virus  or  virus-infected  cells  within 
specimens and the non-standardized dilution of samples.  

  As  far  as  RSV  is  concerned  higher  viral  loads  seem  to 
correspond with  a more severe clinical  course of the disease 
[94, 95] and an increased likelihood of recurrence of wheez-
ing  [24].  In  patients  in  whom  multiple  viruses  are  detected 
quantitative  RT-PCR  may  help  to  discriminate  between  the 
virus actually causing the acute respiratory disease and those 
simultaneously  detected  but  without  a  causative  relationship 
to the actual clinical symptoms.  

Determination of RSV-Specific Antibodies (Serology) 

  Testing  for  virus  specific  antibodies  is  not  useful  for  the 
diagnosis  of  acute  RSV-infection.  A  serologic  response  is 
usually  not  detectable  in  infants,  despite  severe  RSV  infec-

tion [75, 96]. Even when sophisticated tests for the detection 
of  class  specific  antibodies  are  used,  the  infant’s  own  anti-
body  response  is  barely  detectable  in  the  presence  of  mater-
nally derived  antibodies [97] and even in older children and 
groups of patients repeated infections are usually not associ-
ated with  a detectable  antibody response [75, 98]. Screening 
for  RSV-specific  antibodies  is  mostly  performed  to  obtain 
seroepidemiologic  information  and  for  research  purposes 
[99].  

FUTURE  TRENDS  AND  NEEDS  FOR  IMPROVE-
MENT  

 
Future developments for the diagnosis of viral respiratory 
tract infection should enhance the development of cost effec-
tive,  sensitive  and  rapid  tests  allowing  the  screening  of  at 
risk  populations  for  all  probable  causative  agents.  RT-
multiplex PCRs have been developed to use numerous prim-
ers  within  a  single  reaction  tube  to  amplify  nucleic  acid 
fragments  from  different  respiratory  viral  pathogens.  Up  to 
now  data  on  the  comparative  analysis  between  multiplex 
reactions and  mono-reactions on  the  same sample  indicate  a 
reduced  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  multiplex  systems 
[80].  Therefore  more  research  is  needed  to  overcome  the 
problems  associated  with  the  use  of  multiple  sets  of  high 
concentration primers and to identify reaction conditions that 
can be combined in order to obtain maximal specificity with 
a  minimal  loss  in  sensitivity.  Target-enriched  multiplexing 
amplification and the use of padlock probe design may aid to 
overcome  these  technical  problems  [100].  In  addition  opti-
mized extraction procedures,  improved standardisation asso-
ciated  with  more  automation  and  different  testing  protocols 
for summer and winter  months based on epidemiologic data 
will  provide  accurate  and  clinically  meaningful  results  that 
will considerably improve diagnosis of respiratory infections 
and directly impact patient management.
