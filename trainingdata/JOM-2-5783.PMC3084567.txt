General health screening as part of a
periodontal examination

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes are common systemic illnesses with reliable, predictive risk
factors. CVD is the number one killer worldwide accounting for nearly 30% of deaths and type 2 diabetes has
reached epidemic proportions in many western industrialized countries. Both of these illnesses can go
undiagnosed in an alarming number of people for significant periods of time. The relationship between oral
health and systemic health has become the focus of much discussion and research in recent times. It is now
widely accepted that periodontal disease is associated with systemic illnesses such as CVD and type 2 diabetes.
Cigarette smoking and obesity are major risk factors accounting for a large portion of the global disease
burden. Many periodontal patients may be at risk of systemic conditions but be asymptomatic and
undiagnosed. With an aging population who are mostly retaining their natural dentition, the need for
periodontal management will continue to rise in the future. Dental professionals are well placed to perform
general health screening for their patients. Therefore, risk assessment during the periodontal examination may
facilitate the early identification of the large proportion of people who are unaware of their risk status. As
identification and intervention of patients with increased risk factors is key to lowering the systemic disease
burden, general health screening during periodontal examinations may present an important opportunity for
many patients.

Despite significant improvements in the awareness

and prevention of chronic systemic illnesses in
western industrialized countries, lifestyle-related
diseases are limiting gains in life expectancy. Obesity, lack
of physical activity, and the use of tobacco can lead to
heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and many other serious
health problems. In 2008, the Australian Institute of
Health and Welfare (AIHW) reported that although
approximately 84% of the population rated their health
as good or excellent:

1. 19% of male and 17% female adults in Australia
were obese with a further 41% of male and 25% of
female adults being overweight

2. 50% of adults were not sufficiently physically active
3. approximately 17% of people aged 14 years and over

smoked daily (1)

Dentists are ideally placed to screen patients for increased
risk of several serious systemic illnesses  including
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes. The
AIHW, Dental Statistics Research Unit (DSRU) reports

that around half of all Australian adults visit their dentist
annually (2). During these visits dentists have the ability
to screen patients, increase patient awareness, provide
education, and make appropriate referrals. A US study
found that of men aged 40 years and older who had no
reported cardiovascular risk factors and who had not
seen a general medical practitioner in the previous 12
months but had seen a dentist, 18.3% were at an
increased risk of experiencing a serious CVD event within
10 years (3).

is the theme of
the Journal of Oral
Microbiology. The association between periodontal dis-
ease and systemic illnesses including CVD, diabetes,
premature low birth weight (PLBW) infants, osteoporo-

discussed. The oral and systemic burden of infection and
inflammation carried by adults with moderate to severe
periodontal disease places this group of individuals at an

inherently higher risk of these illnesses than those without
periodontal disease in general adult populations (49). As
such, this group would benefit greatly from general health
screening during the periodontal examination.

Patients attending dental clinics for periodontal ther-
apy usually require a series of appointments for examina-
tion, diagnosis, and therapy. Following a course of
therapy, they are most often placed on a maintenance
program for ongoing monitoring of their periodontal
status. During this series of visits, there exists an excellent
opportunity for dentists to screen patients for systemic
illnesses and make them aware of potential risk factors.
Patient education regarding the links between oral health
and systemic health and the risks for systemic illnesses
can be discussed as well as referral to medical practi-
tioners where appropriate.

to assess

A recent study carried out in the US (10) surveyed
their attitudes
practicing general dentists
toward, acceptance of, and perceived barriers to screen-
ing for medical conditions in the dental setting. The
overwhelming majority of respondents thought it was
important and were willing to conduct screening. The
data also suggested that dentists had the necessary
attitudes, beliefs, and intentions to incorporate screening
into their dental practices. Furthermore,
the results
suggested that the large majority of dentists were willing
to refer patients to a medical practitioner for further
disease assessment and diagnosis. In addition to patient
awareness of their risk factors, this is obviously another
critical component of the prevention and management of
systemic illnesses.

Risk assessment
Risk assessment can be defined as the process by which
qualitative or quantitative assessments are made of the
likelihood for adverse events to occur as a result of
exposure to specified health hazards or by the absence of
beneficial influences (11). The World Health Organiza-
tion reports that more than one-third of the world’s
deaths can be attributed to a small number of risk factors
(12). The five leading global risks for mortality in the
world are high blood pressure, tobacco use, high blood
glucose, physical inactivity, and overweight and obesity.
They are responsible for raising the risk of chronic
diseases across countries of all income groups (12).

In the cases of CVD and type 2 diabetes, there are
increased
reliable risk factors that are indicative of
likelihood of the development and progression of these
diseases.

The early identification and intervention of patients
with increased risk factors for systemic illnesses can
greatly reduce their long-term mortality and morbidity. It
is especially important in young to middle age adults 
despite their lower relative risk, because the early and
prolonged intervention of the identified risk factors can

have significant and positive effects on long-term health.
Lifestyle modification including smoking cessation,
weight control, increased physical activity, and adopting
a high-quality diet has the potential to bring about a
significant reduction in long-term risk (13). As these
lifestyle choices and behaviors usually develop early in
life,
identification and the implementation of
preventive initiatives can significantly affect long-term
outcomes.

their

Cardiovascular disease (CVD)
CVDs include a variety of heart and vascular conditions
including coronary heart disease (CHD), atherosclerosis,
acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke. CVD accounts
for nearly 30% of deaths worldwide (12).

The Framingham heart study (14) is the most widely
applied, well recognized and validated tool for assessing
the increased risk of experiencing a severe CHD event
within 10 years. It described seven traditional cardiovas-
cular risk factors (see Table 1) that are additive in
predictive power. Wilson et al. (14) reported the accuracy
of a simple algorithm in assigning absolute risk for CHD
(including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coron-
ary insufficiency or unstable angina, and CHD deaths),
whereby a 10% Framingham risk score meant a patient
had a 10% likelihood of experiencing a CHD event within
10 years. Risk categories were defined as low risk (B10%),
intermediate risk (1020%), and high risk (20%).

The global risk assessment score is calculated by adding
the number of Framingham points that are weighted for
each of the risk factors  age, total cholesterol, high
density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), blood pressure
measurement, diabetes, and smoking (14). This score is
then used to determine the relative risk, which is a ratio of
the absolute risk of a given individual to that of a low-risk
group. While the Framingham score is useful for estimat-
ing risk, it does not adequately account for severity of
some individual risk factors such as heavy smoking or
severe hypercholesterolemia  especially where only one
severe risk factor is present (13). For example, a heavy

smoker with no other traditional risk factors would be
underscored using the Framingham score.

Further to the traditional risk factors predisposing and
conditional risk factors for CHD were identified and are
listed in Table 2 (13). The predisposing risk factors were
those that worsen the independent risk factors. The
conditional risk factors were associated with increased
risk for CHD but their causative,
independent, and
quantitative contributions to CHD had not been well
documented at that time.

A recent study (15) evaluated emerging risk factors for
CHD (Table 3), including periodontal disease, for their
ability to further stratify the intermediate risk group. It
concluded that the current evidence did not support the
routine use of any of these for further risk stratification
and that in many cases more good-quality studies were
required. In the case of periodontal disease, this review
and meta-analysis suggested that it was an independent,
though relatively weak, risk factor for CHD. This
conclusion is supported by several other studies (1619)
while others have failed to do so (2023).

The support for a causal relationship between period-
ontal disease and CVD would come from long-term
interventional studies that have been limited by their scale
and associated costs. However, to date there is evidence
from biological studies supporting the role of molecular
mimicry as a possible mechanism for the association
between periodontal disease and CVD (24). As a
significant number of patients with CHD do not possess
any of the traditional Framingham risk factors, the
discussion by Helfand et al. (15) regarding the necessity
of further research to elucidate additional independent
risk factors and those which are able reclassify inter-
mediate risk patients cannot be overemphasized.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and the
National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance of Aus-
tralia (25, 26) have very useful online cardiovascular risk
calculators that may assist dental professionals in screen-
ing their patients.

Type 2 diabetes
Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases
characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from a defi-
ciency of insulin action. This is the result of either
inadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue
responses to insulin. Frequently, both of these dysfunc-
tions coexist in the same patient. The chronic hypergly-
cemia associated with diabetes
to long-term
complications including CVD, nephropathy leading to
renal failure, retinopathy with potential loss of vision,
and peripheral neuropathy (27). The current classification
of diabetes can be found in Table 4.

additional 29.5% with impaired fasting plasma glucose
(FPG) or impaired glucose (IGT) tolerance. It is reported
that approximately 40% of
the US population has
undiagnosed diabetes (29). This group of patients is
particularly alarming as they are unaware of
their
condition and may be suffering from progressive retinal,
renal, and cardiovascular complications.

The classic symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include
polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss (sometimes with poly-
phagia), and blurred vision. However, these symptoms
are non-specific and they tend to develop gradually so
they are poor indicators of diabetes. Obesity is the leading
risk factor for type 2 diabetes (30). Since 1997, The
American Diabetes Association has recommended dia-
betes screening as part of routine medical care for all
adults 45 years and older and younger adults who are
overweight or possess any of the high-risk factors defined
in Table 5. In the absence of abnormal findings, this
screening should be repeated every 3 years.

In 2007, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)
published a consensus on the prevention of type 2
diabetes (31). The IDF recommended screening by health
care professionals and provided a simple checklist for risk
factors that can be found in Table 6. Similarly, the
American Diabetes Association and Diabetes Australia
have online diabetes risk tests (32, 33) that could be useful
in identifying patients at high risk. Individuals who are
determined to be at risk should be referred to a medical
practitioner for evaluation.

Cigarette smoking
Cigarette smoking is one of the most important causes of
death globally. It is one of the leading risks for CVD,
respiratory diseases and cancer  accounting for 11% of
the global disease burden and 18% of deaths in high-
income countries (12). Smoking acts synergistically with

other risk factors, substantially increasing the risk of
CHD (34). A substantial decrease in CHD and stroke
mortality is reported for former smokers compared with
continuing smokers (35, 36).

Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and
the benefits from smoking cessation are widespread, even
in heavy smokers. Not only do former smokers signifi-
cantly reduce the risks of the development of systemic
illnesses but they also reduce the risks of complications
from existing smoking-related diseases. Smoking cessa-
tion is associated with improvements in lung function and
relief
from respiratory symptoms such as coughing,
wheezing, and shortness of breath. These effects are
apparent very soon after quitting and are sustained with
long-term abstinence (37).

A Cochrane systematic review of several large rando-
mized clinical trials (38) included analyses of the effects
of smoking cessation on cardiovascular risk and found a
substantial reduction in the risk of CVD after quitting.
Even patients with diagnosed CHD can experience up to

50% reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death and
total mortality when they quit smoking after the initial
infarction (39).

Smokers with comorbidities such as respiratory and
CVDs have a greater and more urgent need to stop
smoking. This group often gains motivation to quit
smoking from their illness and studies show that inter-
vention with smoking cessation advice following hospi-
talization with a coronary event is associated with a 50%
long-term quit rate (40). This success rate is remarkable
compared to the average 12-month abstinence rates
without intervention in the general population, which is
reported to be 5.7% (41).

An excellent review by Zee (42) outlines the relation-
ship between smoking and periodontal disease. It is
reported that smoking is a significant risk factor for the
development of periodontal diseases (4345) and that
smokers carry 2.53.5 times greater risk of severe period-
ontal attachment loss compared to non-smokers (46).
Risk calculations suggest that 40% of chronic period-
ontitis cases may be attributed to smoking (47). With this
in mind, many patients attending for periodontal exam-
ination will be smokers and will benefit greatly from
smoking cessation advice.

Smoking cessation programs and therapies are avail-
able in most countries and include both behavioral
support and effective pharmacological preparations.
The adjunctive use of nicotine replacement therapies
and other antismoking drugs (e.g. Bupropion) have been
shown to significantly increase smoking cessation success
rates (47).

In Australia, there is a government-funded online and
telephone support program  Quit Now (51). This
program provides
the effects of
smoking on the body and provides advice and support
for both smokers and health care professionals. Rando-
mized clinical trials report that routine smoking cessation
counseling by dental professionals increases the success
rates for their patients (4850). A trial in a periodontal
clinic reported an abstinence rate at 12-months follow-up
of 13.3% in the intervention group compared to 5.3% in
the control group (49).

As dental professionals have been shown to be
effective in increasing the number of patients who
successfully quit smoking (47), the routine screening of
patients for cigarette smoking during the periodontal
examination is recommended. Once identified, smokers
should be offered assistance and encouragement to quit.

Obesity
Obesity is a complex multifactorial chronic condition,
involving social, behavioral, cultural, physiological, me-
tabolic, and genetic factors. The World Health Organiza-
tion estimated that in 2005, more than 1 billion people
worldwide were overweight and more than 300 million
were obese (12). Globally, 44% of the diabetes burden
and 23% of
the ischemic heart disease burden are
attributable to overweight and obesity (12). Physical
inactivity was identified as a major contributor to the
current global increase in obesity. The WHO estimates
inactivity causes approximately 27% of
that physical
diabetes and approximately 30% of
ischemic heart
disease burden globally (12). Conversely, physical activity
reduces the risk of CVD, some cancers, and type 2
diabetes (12).

Obesity is defined by the AHA as major risk factor for
CVD. The effects of obesity include raised blood pressure
and cholesterol levels, lowered high density lipoprotein-
cholesterol levels, and predisposition to type 2 diabetes
(13). The risk of CHD, stroke, hypertension, and type 2
diabetes grows steadily with increasing body mass (12,
52).

Obesity is most often defined by body mass index
(BMI), which is calculated by dividing weight in kilo-
grams by the square of height in meters (kg/m2). Using
the BMI, overweight is defined as BMI]25 kg/m2 and
obese as BMI]30 kg/m2. However, studies now suggest
that waist circumference, which reflects abdominal fat
may be a better indicator of the risk of developing
systemic illness than BMI (53, 54). Waist circumference
measurements]94 cm for men and 80 cm for women
represent a increased risk and measurements of]102 for

men and]88 cm for women indicate a substantially
increased risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and CVD
(55).

Ford et al. (56) examined how long-term changes in
weight affected the risk of type 2 diabetes and found that
with increasing BMI, the risk for developing diabetes
increased rapidly. It was reported that for every kilogram
change in weight there was a 4.5% change in risk (56).

Recent epidemiological studies have linked periodontal
disease and obesity (57, 58). A review by Pischon et al.
(59) aiming at increasing the awareness of dental practi-
tioners in treating obese patients, discussed the associa-
tion and potential biological mechanisms linking these
conditions. Adipose tissue is not merely a passive
triglyceride reservoir. It produces a vast amount of
proinflammatory cytokines and hormones that contri-
bute to systemic inflammation and insulin resistance 
which can, in turn, lead to the development of CVD and
type 2 diabetes.

A study that analyzed NHANES III study population
found that individuals who maintained a normal weight,
exercised regularly, and consumed a high-quality diet
were 40% less likely to have periodontitis (60). The
authors concluded that it would be beneficial to involve
dental professionals in the effort to reduce the risk of
chronic health conditions, not only by improving oral
health but also by promoting these healthy lifestyle
behaviors.

The major public health challenge of

the obesity
epidemic has been recognized for many years in both
the public health and scientific communities and this has
led to expert committee recommendations on the identi-
fication, prevention, and treatment of obese individuals
(55). There is strong evidence that weight loss in over-
weight and obese individuals reduces risk factors for both
CVD and diabetes (55).

Management of overweight and obese individuals
should include weight reduction as well as the control
of accompanying risk factors. A useful website with
resources for patients and health professionals has been
developed by the Australian government to address the
issue of obesity at a community level (61). Weight loss is
most effectively achieved when an individually planned
program of dietary therapy, increased physical activity,
and behavioral therapy is combined (55). There is also
strong evidence that the adjunctive use of weight loss
drugs in addition to this program can be of benefit.

Weight loss surgery for clinically severe obesity (BMI
]40 or BMI 3540 with comorbid conditions) should be
considered in carefully selected patients where less
invasive methods of weight loss have failed.

Smoking and obesity compound cardiovascular risk
but many patients fear weight gain during smoking
cessation therapy. However, the clinical guidelines advise

that all smokers regardless of their weight status should
be encouraged to quit smoking as a primary focus (55).

Conclusions
It is now widely accepted amongst the medical and dental
literature that periodontal disease is associated with
systemic illnesses such as CVDs and type 2 diabetes
(1618, 62). Therefore, many periodontal patients may be
at risk of these systemic conditions but be asymptomatic
and undiagnosed. Screening periodontal patients for risk
factors associated with these conditions could potentially
make a huge impact on the associated morbidity and
mortality.

As the population ages, the incidence and prevalence
of chronic diseases such as CVD and type 2 diabetes are
expected to increase steadily. Australian statistics show
that the rate of adults who had no natural teeth more
than halved from 14.4 to 6.4% in the 17-year period
between 1987/1988 and 2004/2006 (64). Almost all of this
reduction occurred because of
the passing of older
generations that lived through the first half of the 20th
century when dental extractions were widespread. It has
been projected that during the next four decades the
decline in prevalence of complete tooth loss will continue,
falling to 1% or less by the 2040s (64). One can only
assume that an aging population with high retention of
natural dentition will result in an increased prevalence of
periodontal disease in the community. With more
patients requiring periodontal management,
increased
opportunities for screening for systemic illnesses during
periodontal examinations will present.

The first step toward the control of the systemic illness
burden is the identification of people at risk. As dental
professionals are well placed and willing to be involved in
the general health screening of their patients, the period-
ontal examination may become an important opportu-
nity for the early identification of the large proportion of
people who are unaware of their risk status.
