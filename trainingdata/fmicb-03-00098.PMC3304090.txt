A herpesvirus virion is composed of a viral genomic DNA-containing capsid surrounded
by a viral envelope with glycoprotein spikes on its surface. Located between the capsid
and the outer viral envelope is the virion tegument layer. Though the majority of the virion
proteins are located in the tegument, this layer is less studied and was thought to be an
amorphous structure. Over the last decade, a number of studies have indicated the pres-
ence of organized tegument structures across the spectrum of herpesviruses, implicating
tegument components in critical steps governing the viral life cycle. In the case of Kaposi’s
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the etiological agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma, several
functions exerted by tegument proteins at different stages of the viral life cycle, inclusive
of primary de novo infection and virion assembly, have been identiﬁed over the last several
years. In this review, KSHV tegument components are cataloged and the occurrence of
organized tegument structures in KSHV, built through interactions amongst the different
virion proteins, is discussed in depth.The signiﬁcant functional roles of the KSHV tegument
proteins at different stages of the viral life cycle are elaborated under separate headings.
Deﬁnitive functional roles exerted by tegument proteins of related gamma-herpesviruses
are also discussed. Since tegument proteins play key roles during viral assembly, viral entry,
and represent an important interface for virus–host interactions, further research in this
area should provide detailed insights into the functional capacity of the KSHV tegument,
resulting in a better understanding of the viral life cycle.

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological
agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS). Based on phylogenetic analysis,
KSHV is placed in the human herpesviridae family and gamma
herpesvirinae sub-family along with other closely related gamma-
herpesviruses such as Epstein–Barr virus (EBV; Chang et al., 1994;
Moore et al., 1996; Russo et al., 1996). KSHV being the last addi-
tion to the human herpesvirus group is thus also designated as
the human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8; Moore et al., 1996; Russo et al.,
1996). KSHV was ﬁrst identiﬁed in 1994 from a KS lesion (Chang
et al., 1994) and thereafter has been found to be unequivocally
associated with KS (Chang et al., 1994; Dupin et al., 1995; Moore
and Chang, 1995; Schalling et al., 1995; Chuck et al., 1996). Prior
to the AIDS epidemic, KS was a rare disease occurring predomi-
nantly in elderly men across the Mediterranean and Middle East
regions (Dupin et al., 1995). KS is now recognized as a lead-
ing cause of death in AIDS patients (Moore and Chang, 1995;
Antman and Chang, 2000; Ganem, 2010). The AIDS-associated KS
(AIDS-KS) manifests frequently on the skin with high propensity
to spread to multiple organs such as lungs and the gastrointestinal
tract (Dezube, 1996; Ganem, 2010). AIDS-KS is the most com-
mon oral malignancy in HIV-infected individuals contributing to
about 70–90% of all AIDS-associated oral tumors (Antman and
Chang, 2000). In addition to KS, KSHV is also implicated in two
other lymphoproliferative disorders, namely the primary effusion

lymphoma (PEL; Cesarman et al., 1995a) and the plasma cell
variant of multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD; Soulier et al.,
1995).

Similar to other herpesviruses, KSHV exhibits two alternative
phases in its life cycle, the lytic and latent. Primary infection of
a host cell begins with the entry of KSHV viral particles into the
cell which get transported to the nucleus (Akula et al., 2001; Wang
et al., 2001; Chandran, 2010). The viral genomic DNA is released
into the nucleus and establishes viral latency by default (Cesarman
et al., 1995b; Ballestas et al., 1999). In latently infected cells, there
is expression of only a limited number of viral (latent) genes and
no infectious virions are produced (Zhong et al., 1996; Sarid et al.,
1998). The latent viral genome undergoes periodic lytic reacti-
vation followed by a temporally regulated cascade of viral gene
expression (Renne et al., 1996; Miller et al., 1997; Sun et al., 1999).
The newly expressed viral proteins assemble to form infectious
mature virions which egress out of the cell and initiate primary
infection of uninfected cells (reviewed in Ganem, 2007).

Unlike other herpesviruses where the latent life cycle is usually
responsible for the disease potential, in KSHV, the lytic cycle is
also responsible, contributing to tumorigenesis. The most com-
pelling evidence for this notion is the observation that treatment
of KS patients or AIDS patients at risk for KS with anti-herpesviral
drugs, such as Foscarnet and ganciclovir that block lytic but not

latent KSHV replication, resulted in regression of KS lesions with
a decrease in the incidence of KS development (Morfeldt and
Torssander, 1994; Martin et al., 1999). Furthermore, the produc-
tive replication cycle directly contributes to viral tumorigenesis by
spreading viruses to target cells and providing paracrine regula-
tion for KS development (Cesarman et al., 2000). An early study by
Grundhoff and Ganem (2004) suggests a role of lytic replication
in sustaining the population of latently infected cells that other-
wise would be quickly lost by segregation of latent viral episomes
as spindle cells divide. Thus, KSHV lytic replication and constant
primary infection to fresh cells are crucial for viral tumorigenic-
ity. Given the importance of the KSHV lytic cycle in both viral
propagation and tumorigenesis, a thorough understanding of viral
lytic replication processes including virion assembly and egress
becomes vital.

KSHV VIRION STRUCTURE AND PROTEINS
A typical herpesviral particle (or virion) consists of the following
morphologically distinct components: (i) a core which contains a
linear double stranded viral DNA enclosed within an icosahedral
capsid, (ii) an outer envelope with viral glycoproteins appearing as
spikes on the surface, and (iii) an electron-dense material deﬁned
as the tegument, located between the capsid and envelope (Pellet
and Roizman, 2007). During the lytic cycle, almost the entire set
of KSHV viral genes are expressed. Approximately one-third of
these viral genes encode virion proteins that assemble into infec-
tious virions. These virion proteins are thought to contain the
functional information required for both de novo primary infec-
tion and for the KSHV virion assembly and egress. Employing
proteomic approaches, two independent studies identiﬁed nearly
thirty KSHV virion proteins from puriﬁed KSHV virions (Bechtel
et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2005).

Among these virion proteins, ﬁve are characterized as capsid
proteins (Nealon et al., 2001). Speciﬁc interactions amongst these
capsid proteins mediate capsid assembly processes (Sathish and
Yuan, 2010). Seven virion proteins are speciﬁed as viral glycopro-
teins, mediating entry of KSHV into host cells through interactions
with the host cell surface receptors (Baghian et al., 2000; Akula
et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2001; Naranatt et al., 2002; Koyano et al.,
2003; Chandran, 2010). Although the viral capsid and the enve-
lope are well-characterized, the KSHV tegument remains largely
undeﬁned. The ﬁrst step toward deﬁning the KSHV tegument
was an identiﬁcation of its component proteins. The majority
of earlier identiﬁed KSHV virion proteins were characterized as
tegument components, on the basis of speciﬁc biochemical crite-
ria. These criteria included (i) resistance to trypsin digestion in the
absence of detergent and (ii) susceptibility to trypsin digestion fol-
lowing treatment with outer viral envelope dissolving detergents
(Bechtel et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2005). Based on these criteria,
proteins encoded by ORFs 21, 33, 45, 64, and 50 (replication
transcription activator/Rta) are identiﬁed as components of the
KSHV tegument (Bechtel et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2005). In addi-
tion, proteins encoded by ORFs 6, 7, 11, 52, 63, and 75, which
belong to neither the capsid nor the viral envelope, are also con-
sidered putative tegument proteins (Bechtel et al., 2005; Zhu et al.,
2005). Among these, (i) ORFs 11, 52, and 75 are identiﬁed as tegu-
ment components in closely related gamma-herpesviruses such
as murine herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) and murid herpesvirus 4

(MHV-4; Bortz et al., 2003, 2007; Gaspar et al., 2008). On the basis
of considerable sequence similarity, the KSHV homologs of these
ORFs are also considered tegument components (Bechtel et al.,
2005; Zhu et al., 2005); (ii) the analog of ORF63 in HSV-1 is a
well-characterized tegument protein and is predicted to encode
for a tegument protein in KSHV as well (Russo et al., 1996; Zhu
et al., 2005); (iii) ORFs 6 and 7 are yet to be characterized (May
et al., 2005a,b). ORF19 and ORF67 are also predicted to encode for
tegument proteins, based on their sequence homology to tegument
proteins of other well-characterized herpesviruses and await fur-
ther characterization (Russo et al., 1996). Taken together, proteins
encoded by ORFs 11, 21, 33, 45, 50, 52, 63, 64, and 75 are currently
considered as KSHV tegument proteins with several more to be
characterized.

Though the tegument was earlier considered an amorphous
layer of proteins, recent studies indicate the occurrence of ordered
tegument structures built through speciﬁc protein–protein inter-
actions in HSV-1 (Zhou et al., 1999; Vittone et al., 2005), human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV; Chen et al., 1999; Phillips and Bresna-
han, 2011), and MHV-68 (Dai et al., 2008). Figure 1 illustrates a
3D structure of MHV-68 virion reconstructed by cryoET, which
demonstrates a two-layered organization of the tegument. The
inner tegument layer (green in Figure 1B) remains tethered to the
capsid by directly interacting with it. The outer tegument (violet
in Figure 1B) occupies the space between the inner layer and the
envelope, and is much more loosely organized, as it conforms to
the irregular shape of the viral envelope.

Further details regarding the tegument architecture were
obtained through a systematic investigation of the KSHV tegu-
ment protein interactions (Figure 2). A total of 37 binary protein
interactions were detected between the KSHV tegument proteins
and the different virion proteins (inner capsid proteins/tegument
proteins/outer envelope glycoproteins; Rozen et al., 2008). This
observation pointed to the occurrence of organized tegument
structures in KSHV also. A signiﬁcant proportion of the above
interactions are mediated by the tegument proteins encoded by
ORFs 21, 33, 45, 52, 63, 64, and 75 (Rozen et al., 2008).

FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF KSHV TEGUMENT PROTEINS IN
VIRAL ASSEMBLY PROCESSES
Herpesviral assembly is a multi-stage process consisting of the
following events: (i) incorporation of the newly replicated DNA
into the pre-formed capsid within the nucleus generating the viral
nucleocapsid; (ii) exit of the nucleocapsid from the nucleus into
the cytoplasm through a sequence of coordinated steps such as
acquisition of a primary envelope (from the nuclear membrane)
by the nucleocapsid and its subsequent loss; (iii) acquisition of
tegument proteins by the nucleocapsid in the cytoplasm and trans-
portation of tegumented capsids to sites of ﬁnal envelopment, the
Golgi-derived vesicles; (iv) ﬁnal envelopment including acquisi-
tion of other tegument and envelope glycoproteins by budding
into the vesicles; and (v) egress of mature virions from the infected
cell following fusion of the vesicle membrane with the cell plasma
membrane (reviewed in Mettenleiter, 2002; Mettenleiter et al.,
2009). Although the above framework for herpesvirus assembly
and egress may be common to all herpesviruses, the detailed steps
and the mechanisms underlying these processes have been less
studied in gamma-herpesviruses including KSHV.

(outside the hexagon but within the oval), and envelope (outside oval) are

indicated with arrows. The interaction pattern of the
ORF64–ORF52–ORF33–ORF45 network with multiple virion proteins is
evident from the ﬁgure.

Dynamic and intricate interactions mediated by the tegument
proteins amongst themselves as well as with the inner capsid
and the outer envelope proteins impacts both tegumentation and
envelopment in related herpesviruses like HSV and HCMV thus
inﬂuencing viral assembly processes (Mettenleiter, 2002; Metten-
leiter et al., 2009). Given the homology amongst tegument proteins

of herpesviruses, it is reasonable to assume that tegument pro-
teins in KSHV could also inﬂuence virion assembly pathways.
As a ﬁrst step toward bridging the existing gap, interactions of
the KSHV tegument proteins with the different virion proteins
(capsid/tegument/envelope) have been systematically investigated
(Rozen et al., 2008). This has led to a revelation of a virion-wide

protein interaction network (Figure 2). This network is expected
to serve as a road map to gain insights into the less studied but
critical KSHV tegumentation and viral assembly processes. Here
we attempt to summarize the knowledge accumulated over the
recent years regarding roles of KSHV tegument proteins in virion
assembly and egress.

ORF64
This ORF encodes for a 290-kDa tegument protein and is the
largest protein encoded by the KSHV genome. Homologues of
ORF64 exist across the three herpesvirus sub-families (Zhu et al.,
2005). The earlier established KSHV protein interaction map indi-
cated a diverse interaction potential of ORF64. This protein was
found to interact with three viral capsid proteins, namely ORFs 25
(major capsid protein/MCP), 26 (TRI-2), and 62 (TRI-1; Rozen
et al., 2008), suggesting an attachment of ORF64 to the icosa-
hedral capsid structure (Figure 2). This is likely to be true as
the HSV-1 analog, VP1/2 encoded by UL36, is also involved in
a tight interaction with the viral capsid (McNabb and Courtney,
1992; Newcomb and Brown, 2010). A three-dimensional image
reconstructed from a cryo-electron microscopic study of HSV-1
particles revealed interactions of the ORF64 homolog of HSV-1
(VP1/2) with MCP, TRI-2, and TRI-1 (Zhou et al., 1999). There is
no doubt that the association of ORF64 with three capsid proteins
is conserved across the herpesvirus family.

KSHV ORF64 was also found to interact with several tegu-
ment proteins including ORFs 11, 21, 33, 45, 63, 75 and with itself
(Rozen et al., 2008). The interactions of ORF64 with a plethora of
tegument proteins has led to a hypothesis that ORF64 functions
as a major hub or a scaffold protein, recruiting other tegument
proteins during KSHV virion tegumentation (Rozen et al., 2008).
ORF64 also interacted with several envelope glycoproteins (Rozen
et al., 2008). This ﬁnding justiﬁes a rather peculiar behavior of
ORF64 wherein its degradation was noticed subsequent to treat-
ment of intact virion particles with trypsin, despite the absence of
envelope dissolving detergent, suggesting its association with the
viral envelope as well (Zhu et al., 2005). The ability of ORF64 to
interact with KSHV glycoproteins is consistent with a role of this
protein in positioning the DNA-ﬁlled tegumented capsid at the
trans-Golgi apparatus through association with envelope glyco-
proteins, promoting secondary envelopment processes. Delineat-
ing the interaction dynamics of KSHV ORF64 with the different
virion components is needed to identify the step/s in which these
interactions occur in the viral assembly pathways.

ORF45
This ORF encodes a protein of 407 amino acids (Zhu and Yuan,
2003; Zhu et al., 2005), homologues of which are present only in
gamma-herpesviruses. An important functional role of ORF45 in
KSHV assembly pathways was suggested in a study employing an
ORF45-null recombinant KSHV (Zhu et al., 2006). A noticeably
lowered yield of progeny virions was obtained from ORF45-null
recombinant mutant virus reconstituted cells as compared to that
obtained from cells reconstituted with the wild-type virus though
viral gene expression and viral DNA replication remained unaf-
fected in the absence of ORF45 (Zhu et al., 2006). A speciﬁc role of
ORF45 in KSHV virion assembly was revealed by the ﬁnding that

ORF45 interacts with the microtubule (MT) associated kinesin-2
motor protein, KIF3A, and mediates the docking of entire viral
capsid–tegument complex on to the cargo-binding domain of
KIF3A (Sathish et al., 2009). KIF3A is involved in transporta-
tion of cargo along the MTs from the nucleus toward the cell
periphery (Yamazaki et al., 1995; Hirokawa, 2000). Inhibition
of KIF3A–ORF45 interaction with a headless dominant negative
(DN) mutant of KIF3A or by an shRNA-mediated silencing of
endogenous KIF3A expression decreased KSHV particle release
noticeably. These approaches, did not impact HSV-1 virion release,
demonstrating the speciﬁcity of KIF3A in transport of KSHV par-
ticles. The above observations led to a proposed model (Figure 3)
on the role of ORF45 in KSHV assembly and egress, wherein
(i) subsequent to nuclear egress, KSHV capsids acquire tegu-
ment proteins such as ORFs 64, 63, and 45 in the cytoplasm, (ii)
ORF45 recruits KIF3A and mediates loading of the viral particles
onto KIF3A, and (iii) the viral particles are transported along the
MTs from the peri-nuclear region to the cell periphery or trans-
Golgi network (TGN) membrane for ﬁnal envelopment and egress
(Sathish et al., 2009). The KSHV envelope glycoproteins were not
transported along with the KSHV tegument–capsid complexes,
indicating that as newly assembled viral tegumented capsids are
transported by kinesin-2 to sites of further envelopment, viral
glycoproteins travel separately.

ORF52
This ORF encodes a small protein of 21 kDa, conserved across the
gamma-herpesviruses with homologs in both the closely related
MHV-68 and EBV (Bortz et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2005). ORF52
has been characterized as a tegument protein in MHV-68 on the
basis of its presence in the detergent-resistant pellet fraction sub-
sequent to detergent treatment and centrifugation of virions and
its absence in the capsid pellet fraction subsequent to treatment
of virions with non-ionic detergent by high salt extraction and
centrifugation (Bortz et al., 2007). MHV-68 ORF52 shares a 28%
identity with the KSHV homolog, thus serving as a useful model to
assess the functional roles of the less studied KSHV ORF52 (Zhu
et al., 2005; Bortz et al., 2007).

An ORF52-null recombinant MHV-68 exhibited no appar-
ent defects in viral DNA replication, viral lytic gene expression,
and capsid assembly processes. A normal nuclear accumulation
of viral capsid structures was noticed by TEM-based approaches
(Bortz et al., 2007). Though partially tegumented nucleocapsids
could be seen juxtaposed to the trans-Golgi vesicular membra-
nous compartments, enveloped virions were not noticed within
these membranous vesicles. Analysis of these partially tegumented
capsids revealed the presence of capsid proteins and tegument pro-
teins such as ORF64 and ORF67 but the absence of other tegument
proteins such as ORF45 and ORF42 (Bortz et al., 2007). Structural
studies performed on MHV-68 ORF52 have indicated the exis-
tence of an N-terminal α-helical domain which interacts with the
other tegument protein partners (Benach et al., 2007). Failure of
an ORF52 mutant (lacking the N-terminal α-helix) in compensat-
ing defective virion production seen with a MHV-68 ORF52-null
mutant virus clearly demonstrated the necessity of the interac-
tions between ORF52 and other tegument proteins (Benach et al.,
2007). All the above observations suggested a vital role of ORF52

nucleocapsids exit out of the nuclear compartment wherein they acquire

in MHV-68 tegumentation during viral assembly. On the basis
of considerable homology in ORF52 sequences between MHV-68

and KSHV, it is tempting to speculate that similar structural and
functional characteristics could be exhibited by KSHV ORF52 also.

KSHV tegument proteins

ORF33
This ORF encodes a tegument protein of 334 amino acids and
homologs of this protein are present across all three herpesvirus
sub-families (Jenner and Boshoff, 2002; Zhu et al., 2005; Guo
et al., 2009). Though functional studies on ORF33 have not been
undertaken in KSHV, such studies were performed in MHV-68.
An ORF33-null recombinant MHV-68 has provided useful infor-
mation on the functional role of this protein in virion assembly.
This mutant virus did not exhibit any defects in viral DNA repli-
cation, viral gene expression and viral capsid assembly. However,
a TEM-based analysis of thin sections obtained from ORF33-null
MHV-68 virus carrying cells showed a defective release of nucle-
ocapsids from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Enveloped virions
were not seen both within the cytoplasmic vesicles and in the extra-
cellular space (Guo et al., 2009). These observations are consistent
with the functional roles of ORF33 homologues in both HSV-
1 (UL16; Meckes and Wills, 2007) and HCMV (UL94; Liu et al.,
2009) in directing partially tegumented particles to the trans-Golgi
vesicles. Analysis of the intracytoplasmic partially tegumented
particles of ORF33-null MHV-68 revealed the presence of cap-
sid proteins and some tegument proteins including ORF64 and
ORF52 though ORF45 was absent (Guo et al., 2009). These obser-
vations indicate a pivotal role of ORF33 in MHV-68 tegumentation
and viral assembly. It would be worthwhile to investigate if KSHV
ORF33 also exerts a similar function.

PERSPECTIVES ON THE ROLES OF KSHV TEGUMENT PROTEINS IN
VIRAL ASSEMBLY PATHWAYS
The above studies indicate the critical roles exerted by tegument
proteins of KSHV and other related gamma-herpesvirus in viral
assembly processes. The earlier established KSHV virion pro-
tein interaction network indicates the functional potential of an
ORF64–ORF52–ORF33–ORF45 network (Figure 2) in both tegu-
mentation and secondary envelopment processes (Rozen et al.,
2008) and hence would need to be further investigated. Since
virion assembly and egress are dynamic processes, interactions
among virion proteins could be transiently exerted at different
stages in the viral life cycle (Meckes and Wills, 2007). These
dynamic interactions could either be environment-dependent
(such as pH regulated) or could occur as the viral particles travel
through the assembly and egress pathway. Thus the focus of the
virion assembly studies would also need to shift toward identifying
the step(s) in the KSHV viral assembly pathway at which speciﬁc
protein interactions come into play. Though much remains to be
discovered, certain approaches as above could result in a better
understanding of the functional roles of the tegument proteins in
KSHV assembly.

FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF KSHV TEGUMENT PROTEINS IN
VIRAL ENTRY PATHWAYS
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infects a broad range of
cell types in vitro resulting in viral latency. Establishment of KSHV
latency requires the delivery of the viral genome into the host cell
nucleus which is preceded by a well connected sequence of events.
The ﬁrst step involves the binding of KSHV virions, speciﬁcally the
viral envelope glycoproteins (e.g., gB and gpK8.1A), to the ubiqui-
tously expressed heparan sulfate (HS) cell surface receptor (Akula

et al., 2001; Birkmann et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2001; Hahn et al.,
2009), followed by temporal interactions with integrin molecules
and other transmembrane proteins such as xCT (CD98) (Akula
et al., 2002; Kaleeba and Berger, 2006; Veettil et al., 2008). Subse-
quent to the initial binding, the viral particles enter the infected
cells within endocytic vesicles, releasing tegumented capsids into
the cytoplasm by fusion of the viral envelope with the endo-
cytic vesicles (Akula et al., 2003; Raghu et al., 2009; reviewed in
Chandran, 2010).

Transportation of the tegumented capsids to the nucleus
involves a complex interplay between cellular and viral compo-
nents. Confocal microscopic images of KSHV infected cultured
cells revealed a close association of incoming KSHV viral particles
with MTs. Treatment of these cells with MT depolymerizing agents
disrupted the association resulting in an inhibition in nuclear
delivery of the viral DNA (Naranatt et al., 2005; Raghu et al.,
2007, 2009). Dyneins are minus-end directed motors that trans-
port cargo along the MTs from the cell periphery to the nucleus
(Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 1995; King, 2000). Interference with
dynein activity through over expression of dynamitin (dynactin
complex disruptor) or through treatment of cells with sodium
orthovanadate (an inhibitor of dynein activity) resulted in reduced
KSHV genomic DNA in the nucleus of infected cells (Naranatt
et al., 2005). These observations indicated signiﬁcant roles of MTs
and dyneins in the transportation of incoming KSHV particles
toward the nucleus. The above functional roles exerted by MTs
and dyneins are in lines with similar roles exerted by them in
related herpesviruses such as HSV-1 (Douglas et al., 2004; Döh-
ner et al., 2006; Diefenbach et al., 2008) and HCMV (Ogawa-Goto
et al., 2003).

In HSV-1, inner tegument proteins, VP16, VP1-3, UL37, recruit
dynein and dynactin mediating transportation of viral particles
along the MTs (Luxton et al., 2005; Wolfstein et al., 2006). Both
untegumented naked capsids and completely tegumented capsids
of HSV failed to recruit the dynein motors, indicating a role of
inner tegument proteins in recruiting cellular cytoskeletal ele-
ments (Wolfstein et al., 2006). This gives rise to an interesting
premise that tegument proteins of KSHV could also exert a simi-
lar role in dynein-mediated transport of viral particles on MTs. To
date, KSHV virion protein/s mediating transportation of incoming
KSHV particles to the nucleus remains unidentiﬁed thus providing
a very fertile ground for research.

The tegument protein ORF75 of MHV-4 (a murine gamma-
herpesvirus) has been hypothesized to exert a role in incoming
viral particle transportation based on two experimental obser-
vations. The ﬁrst was a signiﬁcant reduction in the peri-nuclear
capsid staining with majority of the particles scattered in the cyto-
−
plasm, during examination of ORF75
virus infected BHK-21
cells by immunoﬂuorescence. The second observation was the
defectiveness of ORF75
viral particles in establishing an infection
subsequent to intranasal infection of mice. This was illustrated by
a steady increase in the viral genome copy numbers in the lungs
of wild-type virus infected mice, which was not noticed in the
ORF75
virus infected animals. These observations suggest a role
of ORF75 in associating the incoming MHV-4 viral particles to
the host motor proteins (Gaspar et al., 2008). On similar lines, the
ORF75 homolog in EBV, BNRF1, mediates the transportation of

incoming viral particles from the endosomal compartments to the
nucleus (Feederle et al., 2006).

PERSPECTIVES ON THE ROLES OF KSHV TEGUMENT PROTEINS IN
VIRAL ENTRY PATHWAYS
As the outermost components of incoming KSHV particles, the
tegument proteins have the potential to mediate viral particle
transportation to the nucleus through interactions with the cellu-
lar cytoskeleton. In the absence of comprehensive studies on this
aspect, there are certain issues which would need to be resolved.
One is the identiﬁcation of KSHV protein(s) participating in the
transport of incoming viral particles through interactions with
the cellular cytoskeleton elements. KSHV inner tegument com-
ponents may be involved in interaction with dyneins and MTs,
as the outer tegument components are released into the cytosol
subsequent to entry.

Yet another interesting aspect would be identifying if any of
the KSHV tegument proteins play a role in the induction of host
cell signaling pathway proteins that regulate cellular cytoskeleton
dynamics. In fact, KSHV cellular entry has been shown to induce
Rho GTPases leading to acetylation of MTs, promoting MT reor-
ganization and transportation of incoming viral particles to the
nucleus (Sharma-Walia et al., 2004; Naranatt et al., 2005; Veettil
et al., 2006; Raghu et al., 2007; reviewed in Chandran, 2010).

REGULATORY ROLES EXERTED BY KSHV TEGUMENT
PROTEINS
ROLES OF ORF45 IN EVASION OF IFN-MEDIATED ANTI-VIRAL RESPONSE
Primary KSHV infection gets initiated with the binding of viral
glycoproteins to host cell surface receptors. This event elicits type
I IFNs that constitute the ﬁrst line of the innate anti-viral defense
mechanism of host cell against the invading virus (reviewed in
Sathish and Yuan, 2011). Induction of type I IFNs is inﬂuenced by
a group of proteins, belonging to the family of IFN regulatory fac-
tors (IRFs). Among the nine different IRFs identiﬁed to date, IRFs
3 and 7 contribute signiﬁcantly to the type I IFN induction (Honda
et al., 2005a,b; Honda and Taniguchi, 2006; Hiscott, 2007). Subse-
quent to a viral infection, the toll-like receptors recognize viruses
and through speciﬁc signaling pathways bring about the activa-
tion of IRFs. Activation of IRFs involves their phosphorylation
and subsequent nuclear translocation, wherein they bind to the
promoter regions of the type I IFN genes mediating their induc-
tion (Honda et al., 2005b). Recent observations have documented a
greater potential of IRF-7 (as compared to IRF-3), in the induction
of type I IFNs (Honda et al., 2005a,b). Type I IFNs thus induced,
mediate the transcription of a diverse group of anti-viral effector
proteins, the IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), which inhibit multiple
stages of the viral life cycle (Goodbourn et al., 2000; Brierley and
Fish, 2002; Sadler and Williams, 2008).

As type I IFNs are elicited immediately following a viral infec-
tion (Perry and Compton, 2006; Zhu et al., 2010), it is essential for
incoming KSHV particles to effectively antagonize them for a suc-
cessful establishment of a primary infection (reviewed in Sathish
and Yuan, 2011). Noticeably reduced transcription of both type I
IFN genes and their cognate receptors following primary KSHV
infection of cultured cells has been documented (Perry and Comp-
ton, 2006). A similar observation witnessed subsequent to primary

infection of cells with UV-irradiated KSHV virions, suggested an
involvement of virion component proteins in disarming the type
I IFN signaling initially triggered by viral glycoprotein attachment
(Naranatt et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2010).

Among the virion proteins, tegument proteins are the outer-
most components of incoming herpesvirus particles, exposed to
the cellular milieu. Therefore the tegument proteins do have a
potential to curtail the type I IFN responses. ORF45 was charac-
terized as a tegument component mediating the type I IFN evasion
in KSHV. Being a KSHV tegument protein, ORF45 is delivered to
the cell cytosol at very early stages of KSHV infection (Zhu et al.,
2010). ORF45 was shown to inhibit the activation of IRF-7, the
master regulator of type I IFN responses, through inhibition of
both its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (Zhu et al.,
2002; Sathish et al., 2011). The role of ORF45 in antagonizing type
I interferon responses during primary infection was demonstrated
using an ORF45-null recombinant virus. While cells infected with
wild-type KSHV failed to induce anti-viral responses judged by
their permissiveness to superinfection with vesicular stomatitis
virus (VSV), infection of cells with an ORF45-null recombinant
KSHV (BAC-stop45) resulted in increased transcription of type
I IFN and downstream anti-viral effector genes that resisted VSV
superinfection. In addition, a lentiviral mediated ectopic expres-
sion of ORF45 in human ﬁbroblast cells diminished the host
cell elicited type I IFN anti-viral responses (Zhu et al., 2010).
Taken together, the inhibitory effect exerted by ORF45 on IRF-7
contributes to KSHV survival subsequent to a primary infection.

ROLE OF ORF63 IN INHIBITION OF INFLAMMATION REACTION
ORF63 has been identiﬁed as a KSHV virion tegument compo-
nent (Russo et al., 1996; Zhu et al., 2005). A recent study revealed
a vital role of this tegument protein in inhibiting the genera-
tion of the inﬂammasome. ORF63 shares amino acid sequence
homology with NLRP1, speciﬁcally its nucleotide binding domain
(NBD) and was found to interact with it (Gregory et al., 2011).
NLRP1 is a protein of the nucleotide binding and oligomeriza-
tion, leucine-rich repeat family (NLRs), which along with TLRs are
placed under the broader group of pattern recognition receptors
(Meylan et al., 2006). Activation pathways involving these NLRs
culminate in the generation of inﬂammasomes, which are large
multimeric protein complexes constituted by speciﬁc NLRs and
procaspase-1 among others (Martinon et al., 2002). The inﬂam-
masomes induce the caspase-1 mediated proteolytic processing
of proinﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 (Stutz
et al., 2009). Induction of these cytokines triggers pyroptosis,
an inﬂammatory process involving caspase-1 mediated death of
infected cells.

The critical role of NLRP1 in combating KSHV was evidenced
by the fact that knockdown of NLRP1 expression in BCBL-1 cells
resulted in increased KSHV genomic DNA replication and infec-
tious virion titers subsequent to lytic reactivation. Conversely,
an siRNA-mediated knockdown of ORF63 resulted in reduced
KSHV lytic gene expression and virion production along with
signiﬁcantly increased expression levels of IL-1β (Gregory et al.,
2011). These observations suggested a role of ORF63 in mediat-
ing a potent reactivation of KSHV through inhibition of NLRP1
activity. ORF63 was found to inhibit both the oligomerization

and the association of NLRP1 with active components of the
inﬂammasome (Gregory et al., 2011).

ORF64 ENCODES FOR A POTENT VIRAL DEUBIQUITINASE
A KSHV large tegument protein encoded by ORF64 functions
as a potent viral deubiquitinase (DUB) (González et al., 2009),
an enzyme that removes ubiquitin (Ub) from either the cellular
E3 ligase or the target protein thus abrogating the Ub-mediated
regulation (Amerik and Hochstrasser, 2004). ORF64 homologues
in related herpesviruses such as HSV-1 (Kattenhorn et al., 2005),
HCMV (Wang et al., 2006), EBV (Sompallae et al., 2008), and
MHV-68 (Gredmark et al., 2007) exhibit DUB activity. The DUB
activity of KSHV ORF64 was localized to its ﬁrst 205 amino acids
in the N-terminal domain. Among the K48- and K63-linked Ub
chains commonly targeted by DUBs, KSHV ORF64 has no dis-
tinct speciﬁcity to either of them and was capable of targeting
both (González et al., 2009). This behavior is in sharp contrast to
the DUBs of other herpesviruses, which had exclusive speciﬁcity
for the K48-linked Ub chains alone (Amerik and Hochstrasser,
2004; Kattenhorn et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006).

An siRNA-mediated knockdown of ORF64 resulted in
decreased reactivation of KSHV from latency accompanied with
decreased levels of viral lytic replication, suggesting a possible role
of ORF64 in inﬂuencing the KSHV lytic cycle through its deu-
biquitination function (González et al., 2009). A recent study has
documented a function of the KSHV ORF64 deubiquitinase in
inhibiting the retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) mediated
type I IFN signaling (Inn et al., 2011). Though RIG-1 is known to
be a cytosolic RNA sensor recognizing viral RNA, recent studies
do indicate a role of this protein in recognition of DNA viruses like
herpesviruses (Samanta et al., 2006, 2008; Rasmussen et al., 2009).
A persistent presence of KSHV was noticed in RIG-1 deﬁcient
cells indicating an important role of this protein in inﬂuencing
the outcome of primary KSHV infection. On these lines it was
also observed that KSHV ORF64 inhibits the tripartite motif pro-
tein 25 (TRIM25) mediated ubiquitination of RIG-1 (Inn et al.,
2011), a critical step essential for the initiation of the type I IFN
signaling cascade (Gack et al., 2007).

In addition, ORF64, by virtue of its being a tegument com-
ponent (Zhu et al., 2005), is delivered into cells during de novo
infection, hence is efﬁciently poised to exert its DUB activity
toward modifying the cellular environment. In this context, HSV-
1 DUB is known to be involved in multiple processes such as
virion transportation along MTs, release of the viral nucleic acid
into the host cell nucleus, tegumentation and viral egress pathways
(Abaitua and O’Hare, 2008; Jovasevic et al., 2008; Shanda and Wil-
son, 2008). It remains to be clariﬁed if KSHV ORF64 DUB also
plays a similar role during de novo infection.

ORF75 HOMOLOGUES TARGET COMPONENTS OF PROMYELOCYTIC
LEUKEMIA NUCLEAR BODIES (PML NUCLEAR BODIES)
MHV-68 tegument protein, ORF75c, has been shown to mediate
the rapid degradation of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML)
nuclear bodies (NBs) through a proteasome-dependent mecha-
nism (Gaspar et al., 2008; Ling et al., 2008). These PML NBs are
dynamic nuclear organelles characterized by the presence of the
PML and several other cellular proteins including Daxx, Sp100,
and ATRX (Bernardi and Pandolﬁ, 2007; Everett and Chelbi-Alix,

2007). IFN treatment is known to directly trigger the transcrip-
tion of several genes associated with PML NBs such as PML and
Sp100, resulting in increased expression levels of these proteins
and an increase in both the size and number of PML NBs (Chelbi-
Alix et al., 1995; Lavau et al., 1995; Grotzinger et al., 1996). These
observations have suggested the involvement of PML NBs and its
constituents in host anti-viral defense mechanisms (Everett and
Chelbi-Alix, 2007).

The EBV homologue of MHV-68 ORF75c, BNRF1, known to
inﬂuence establishment of viral latency (Feederle et al., 2006), has
also been characterized as a PML NB interacting protein. BNRF1
speciﬁcally binds with Daxx, abrogating the association of ATRX
(a Daxx-interacting partner) with Daxx, preventing the localiza-
tion of this complex to the PML-NBs. In addition to interfering
with the PML-mediated anti-viral defenses, this process also reg-
ulates the chromatin organization toward establishment of latent
infection (Tsai et al., 2011).

Targeting PML NBs or their constituent proteins is not a unique
property of gamma-herpesviruses. Similar to EBV BNRF1, the
pp71 tegument protein of HCMV also interacts with Daxx. Unlike
the BNRF1, pp71 induces the degradation of Daxx subsequent to
displacement of ATRX (Lukashchuk et al., 2008). Furthermore,
HSV-1 ICP0 mediates a proteasomal degradation of PML (Maul
et al., 1993; Everett et al., 1998; Boutell et al., 2002). Yet only
the de novo synthesized form is capable of this activity (Maul
et al., 1993) unlike the tegument delivered ORF75c which exerts
its effect immediately following viral infection. With the signif-
icance of PML-NBs and its constituents in inﬂuencing the out-
come of a primary herpesviral infection, it is not surprising that
multiple herpesviruses target PML-NBs or its constituent pro-
teins through multiple mechanisms. It would be interesting to
investigate if KSHV ORF75 also exerts a similar action on the
PML-NBs.

ROLES IN MANIPULATION OF CELLULAR SIGNALING
Several tegument proteins of KSHV have been reported to regulate
or interfere with cellular signal transduction.

(i) A study employing reverse transcription cell microarray
(RTCM) technology identiﬁed ORF75 as a viral gene acti-
vating NF-κB. ORF75 was involved in the inactivation of IκB
complexes, thereby promoting the nuclear translocation of
NF-κB (Konrad et al., 2009; de Oliveira et al., 2010). Increased
levels of NF-κB are known to exert inhibitory effects on
the activation of gamma-herpesvirus lytic promoters, lytic
protein synthesis and virus replication (Brown et al., 2003).
On the other hand, inhibition of NF-κB activity in latently
infected cells facilitates KSHV lytic protein synthesis reﬂective
of viral reactivation (Grossmann and Ganem, 2008). These
observations do suggest the involvement of NF-κB in reg-
ulating the ﬁne balance between the KSHV lytic and latent
phases. In the context of a primary KSHV infection, the release
of ORF75 tegument protein into cells subsequent to primary
infection could activate NF-κB and help establish viral latency.
Future experiments are needed to elucidate the role of ORF75
modulation of NF-κB in KSHV viral latency.

(ii) ORF45 was shown to stimulate the kinase activities of two
serine–threonine kinase proteins, RSK1 and RSK2 (Kuang

Sathish et al.

KSHV tegument proteins

et al., 2008). RSK1 and RSK2 belong to the family of 90-kDa
ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) and are directly phosphory-
lated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as
ERK1/ERK2. The activated RSKs in turn mediate the phos-
phorylation of many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins inﬂu-
encing several biological processes such as gene expression,
cell cycle and cell growth, cell survival and proliferation (Roux
and Blenis, 2004; Hauge and Frodin, 2006). The RSKs are acti-
vated subsequent to both KSHV primary infection and lytic
reactivation. A dramatic reduction in lytic gene expression
and virion titers following lytic reactivation was seen in the
cells exhibiting siRNA-mediated RSK knockdown, suggesting
a role of these RSKs in pathways subsequent to KSHV lytic
reactivation (Kuang et al., 2008).

Infection of cells with UV-irradiated KSHV resulted in activa-
tion of RSKs, indicating that a virion component protein partic-
ipates in the activation (Sharma-Walia et al., 2005). ORF45-null
mutant virus exhibited noticeably reduced activation of ERK/RSK
in the cells infected in comparison to the levels with wild-type
viral infection, indicating a role of ORF45 in the ERK/RSK activa-
tion (Kuang et al., 2008). A more recent study demonstrated that
the binding of ORF45 to RSK also augments the association of

ERK to RSK, resulting in the generation of high-molecular weight
complexes constituted by ORF45, RSK, and ERK. These complexes
help to stabilize the otherwise transient interactions between active
phosphorylated pERK and pRSK, also protecting them against cel-
lular phosphatases (Kuang et al., 2009). Thus, the high-molecular
weight complex-associated RSK and ERK are activated and sus-
tained at levels sufﬁcient to mediate their biological effects. Since
the ERK/RSK MAPK signaling cascade promotes cell survival
and proliferation, the ORF45–RSK–ERK complex may lead to
prolonged cell survival contributing to KSHV viral pathogenesis.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
It is evident that tegument components of KSHV, which were
previously less studied and understood, are slowly catching the
attention of herpesvirologists. KSHV tegument components are
known to inﬂuence several phases of the viral life cycle such as
assembly and transportation of viral particles toward egress, trans-
portation of incoming viral particles toward the nucleus, immune
evasion processes and a multitude of other regulatory roles (an
overview of the functional roles of KSHV tegument proteins is
depicted in Table 1). In spite of this, a number of issues remain
to be addressed. For example, it is unknown if KSHV tegument
components inﬂuence the nuclear egress of capsids into cytosol

KSHV tegument proteins

during viral assembly. It would also be interesting to investigate if
tegument proteins contribute to establishment of latency. Findings
from these studies could serve as examples of the diverse functional
capabilities of the tegument proteins.

Some cellular proteins have been found within the KSHV
virions, presumably in the tegument layer (Zhu et al., 2005).
Although the functions of these cellular proteins in KSHV virion
have not been revealed, it is possible that some of these pro-
teins are speciﬁcally recruited into virions to exert important
roles in viral life cycle. Some of the cellular proteins identiﬁed
in KSHV virions such as non-muscle β-actin, annexins, Hsp70,
Hsp90, 14-3-3, and APOBEC3G have also been detected in other
herpesviruses, other non-herpes DNA viruses and RNA viruses
(Johannsen et al., 2004; del Rio et al., 2005; Chung et al., 2006;

Loret et al., 2008; Kramer et al., 2011). Pharmacological inhi-
bition of Hsp90 or its knockdown by siRNA has been shown
to inhibit replication of several RNA viruses such as HCV and
VSV (Connor et al., 2007; Nakagawa et al., 2007), indicating the
signiﬁcance of virus associated cellular proteins. Understanding
functions of the cellular proteins in KSHV tegument and their
interaction with viral tegument proteins or other virion proteins
would lead to a better understanding of the multiple facets of the
KSHV life cycle. To conclude, we expect to see a great increase in
the number of studies addressing the biological functions of tegu-
ment components of KSHV, and of other herpesviruses. Future
studies on these fascinating proteins should herald the onset of
a new chapter in our ever evolving understanding of herpesvirus
biology.
