The addition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) an-
chors to proteins is an important posttranslational
modification in eukaryotic cells. The complete structural
elucidation of GPI anchors is a complex process that re-
quires relatively large amounts of starting material. In
this paper, we assess the degree of structural information
that can be obtained by applying electrospray mass spec-
trometry and tandem mass spectrometry to permethylated
GPI glycans prepared from a well-characterized GPI-
anchored glycoprotein, the variant surface glycoprotein
from Trypanosoma brucei. All GPI glycans contain a
non-N-acetylated glucosamine residue, and permethyla-
tion leads to the formation of a fixed positive charge on
the glycans, in the form of a quaternary amine. The per-
methylated glycans were detected as [M + Na]2+ ions, and
tandem mass spectrometry of these ions produced sub-
stantial, albeit incomplete, structural information on the
branching patterns and linkage types for various GPI gly-
coforms of the variant surface glycoprotein.

Introduction

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins (GPI-
APs) are ubiquitous among the eukaryotes and are of consid-
erable biological interest, with functions in cell protection, cell
signaling, cell–cell adhesion and host cell–pathogen interac-
tions (Ferguson et al. 2008; Paulick and Bertozzi 2008). GPI
anchors are preassembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)

and added to the C-termini of certain proteins in the ER in ex-
change for the C-terminal signal peptide via a transamidation
reaction (Ferguson et al. 2008; Fujita and Kinoshita 2010). The
GPI anchor may then be further processed via lipid remodeling
and carbohydrate side-chain modiﬁcations, in a protein and
cell type speciﬁc manner, as the GPI-AP transits the secretory
pathway (Ferguson et al. 2008; Fujita and Kinoshita 2010).
The ﬁnal destination for most GPI-APs is the outer leaﬂet of
the plasma membrane or the topologically equivalent luminal
surface of secretory granule membranes.

To elucidate the complete structure of a GPI anchor is a
lengthy undertaking that requires relatively large amounts of na-
tive protein and techniques including 2D nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and gas chromatog-
raphy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based composition and
methylation linkage analyses, for example (Fankhauser et al.
1993; Ferguson et al. 1988; Homans et al. 1988; Schneider et
al. 1990). However, with one exception (from the highly diver-
gent protist Entamoeba; Moody-Haupt et al. 2000), all GPI
anchors determined thus far share the common core structure
of: NH2CH2CH2PO4H-6Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4GlcNα1-
6D-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-lipid (EtN-P-Man3GlcN-PI), where
the amine of the ethanolamine phosphate (EtN-P) group is the
attachment point to the α-carboxyl group of the C-terminus of
the protein (Ferguson et al. 2008). In this paper, we exploit the
chemistry of GPI anchors by using (a) aqueous hydrogen ﬂuo-
ride (HF) dephosphorylation to liberate the GPI anchor glycan
from the parent GPI-AP and (b) permethylation to convert
the free amine of the single non-N-acetylated glucosamine
residue to a quaternary amine carrying a ﬁxed positive
charge. The permethylated GPI glycans ionize well in pos-
itive ion electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS), thanks in
part to this quaternary amine feature (Baldwyn 2005). We
assess the scope and limitations of structural interpretation
that can be obtained from collision-induced dissociation
(CID) tandem mass spectrometry (ES-MS/MS) of permethy-
lated GPI glycans, using a series of well-characterized
structures derived from a variant surface glycoprotein
(VSG) from the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei.

the carbohydrate component of the sVSG121 GPI anchor was
released from the GPI protein by aqueous HF treatment, per-
methylated and puriﬁed by solvent extraction (see Figure 1).
The permethylated glycans were redissolved in 80% acetoni-
trile and 0.5 mM sodium acetate and analyzed by electrospray
mass spectrometry, revealing three major isobaric forms of GPI
glycan. The permethylated glycans contained a ﬁxed positive
charge due to the quaternary amine formed during methylation
of the glucosamine residue and ionized as sodium adducts, pro-
ducing doubly charged [M + Na]2+ ions at m/z 871.9, 973.9 and

1075.9 (see Figure 2). These m/z values were consistent with
fully permethylated glycan ions of composition [Hex6-HexN
(Me3)+Ino + Na]2+, [Hex7-HexN(Me3)+Ino + Na]2+ and
[Hex8-HexN(Me3)+Ino + Na]2+. Based on the known structure
of the sVSG121 GPI anchor (Strang et al. 1993) and of the
closely related sVSG117 and sVSG221 anchors (Ferguson et
al. 1988; Mehlert et al. 1997), these ions can be further as-
signed to the compositions [Gal3Man3GlcN(Me3)+ + Na]2,
[Gal4Man3GlcN(Me3)+ + Na]2+ and [Gal5Man3GlcN(Me3)+ +
Na]2+. The glycoform distribution shown in Figure 2 provides

a rough estimate of the relative amounts of the diﬀerent species
in the sample. Thus, according to the spectrum, the Gal3- and
Gal4-glycoforms of sVSG121 were much more abundant than
the Gal5-glycoform, in agreement with the relative abundances
observed by gel ﬁltration of ﬂuorescently labeled GPI glycans
from the same glycoprotein (Zitzmann et al. 2000).

The doubly charged permethylated GPI glycoforms were se-
lected for CID to provide structural information, in particular
to deﬁne sequence, branching and linkage details. The precur-
sor [M + Na]2+ ions produced singly charged product ions
arising predominantly from cleavage across the glycosidic
bonds together with a number of additional product ions de-
rived from cross-ring cleavages, as will be discussed later.
The nomenclature used to deﬁne fragmentation is based on that

578

introduced by Domon and Costello (1988). In this instance, an
α suﬃx is used to designate cleavages in the GPI anchor man-
nosyl core and a β suﬃx for cleavages in the 3-linked alpha-
galactose branch attached to the GPI core. Fragments derived
from cross-ring cleavages are A-type ions, where the superscript
deﬁnes the position of the cleavage after the corresponding car-
bon atom of the sugar ring.

product ion was m/z 1451.5, which corresponded to the per-
methylated glycan lacking the D-myo-inositol and quaternary
ammonium group of the glucosamine. This non-neutral loss
(see Figure 3) dominates the MS/MS spectrum since almost
all of the other ions are the products of m/z 1451.5 (Figure 4).
A pair of the product ions was observed at m/z 1279.5 and
1261.5 resulting from C- and B-type cleavage at the Manα1-
4GlcN glycosidic bond, and further glycosidic bond cleavages
within these metastable ions produced a number of double-
cleavage ions, as indicated in Figure 4.

580

The presence of double glycosidic cleavage fragments,
termed D-ions, could be used to deﬁne the branching topology
(a detailed overview of how to analyze interresidue linkages
and branching patterns of permethylated glycans by CID is
given in Reinhold et al. 1995). Two dominant double-cleavage
ions observed at m/z 839.4 and 635.3 represented the structures
[(Me-Hex)2(Hex)2-28 + Na]+ and [(Me-Hex)2(Hex)-28 + Na]+,
respectively, indicating two branching points within a sequence
of hexoses. The double glycosidic cleavage ions suggested two
topologies. One glycan structure carried a branched hexose
side chain containing three hexoses (see Figure 4a); the other
species contained two hexose residues in the side chain and a
third hexose attached to the middle mannose of the GPI anchor
glycan core (see Figure 4b). A minor disaccharide fragment ion
at m/z 431.2 [Me(Hex)2-14 + Na]+ further supported these to-
pologies. In contrast, an internal fragment ion at m/z 621.35
[(Hex)3-14 + Na]+ deﬁned only one branching point in a se-
quence of four hexoses, suggesting a linear side chain of
three alpha-galactose residues attached to the third mannose
of the GPI anchor core (see Figure 4c).

Fragments that help deﬁne 1→6, 1→4 and 1→2 linkages
are derived from double-cleavage across the pyranose ring
(Reinhold et al. 1995). Cross-ring cleavage ions at m/z
505.2, 533.2, 723.3 and 1349.5 could be identiﬁed, though
they were relatively weak (see Figure 4, indicated with black
arrows). The m/z 533.2 and m/z 505.2 ions, which were 88 and
60 amu above the glycosidic fragment ion at m/z 445.2, [Me
(Hex)2 + Na]+, indicated the Hex2 moiety to be 6-linked (see
Figure 5a). Thus, this ion is consistent with a 1→6 linkage in
the trimannosyl GPI core (i.e., Man-Man1-6Man) and in the
linear trigalactosyl side chain (i.e., Gal-Gal1-6Gal). The
cross-ring fragment ion observed at m/z 1349.5 deﬁned the tri-
mannosyl core to be linked to the 4-position of the glucosamine,
as it resided 88 amu above the B-type ion at m/z 1261.5, and a
60-amu increment could not be detected (see Figures 4 and 5b).
This arrangement was further supported by an ambiguous
A-type ion at m/z 723.3, which was 74 amu above the ion
at m/z 635.3, [Me(Hex)3-14 + Na]+ (see Figure 5c). Together,
these results were consistent with the presence of
the
conserved sequence Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4GlcN, pre-
sent in almost all GPI anchor structures characterized so far
(Ferguson et al. 2008).

Sequence, branching and linkage assignments for the Gal4
GPI glycan glycoforms
The tandem mass spectrum for the m/z 973.9 ion provided an
analogous series of monosodium adducts to those recorded in
the spectrum of the Gal3-glycoform (Figure 6, see spectrum).
The branching was revealed by double-cleavage ions at m/z
635.3, 825.3 and 839.4. The D-type ion observed at m/z
635.3 represents the structure [Me(Hex)3-14 + Na]+, indicating
one branching point in a linear sequence of three hexoses, as
described in Ferguson et al. (1988) (Figure 6a). In addition, the
ion at m/z 825.3 [Me(Hex)4-28 + Na]+ supports the topology of
two branching points within a sequence of four hexoses (Fig-
ure 6b). Evidence for an additional hexose attached to the
middle mannose of the GPI anchor was provided by the ion
at m/z 839.4 [(Me-Hex)2(Hex)2-28 + Na]+ (Figure 6c). This
ambiguous double-cleavage ion could also indicate the pres-
ence of a branched three-hexose side chain (Figure 6c). An

arrangement of three linear hexose residues in the side chain
was supported by the occurrence of a single glycosidic cleav-
age ion at m/z 649.2 [Me(Hex)3 + Na]+ (not drawn). A linear
side chain consisting of four hexose residues was indicated
by the ambiguous ion at m/z 635.3 [Hex4 + Na]+ (internal
cleavage fragment, not drawn).

Cross-ring fragment ions were also present in the spectrum
of the sVSG121 GPI anchor Gal4-isoform (Figure 6). The ions
at m/z 533.2 and 505.2 are consistent with the 1→6 linkage
between the middle mannose and the mannose next to the glu-
cosamine of the GPI anchor core, as shown for the Gal3-
isoform (see Figure 4a). However, the same ions could also
originate from within the branched Gal side chain (see Figure
7a). The A-type ion identiﬁed at m/z 1553.5, which derived
from the double-cleavage ion at m/z 1465.5 [Me(Hex)7,
Na]+, permitted the assignment of a 1→4 linkage between
the third mannose and the glucosamine (Figure 7b).

Sequence, branching and linkage assignments for the Gal5
GPI glycan glycoforms
The CID spectrum of the Gal5-isoform showed similar features
to the corresponding Gal3- and Gal4-glycoforms (see Figure 8).

582

Glycosidic cleavages resulting in the successive loss of hexose
residues dominated the spectrum. Due to the ambiguity of many
glycosidic fragment ions derived from this glycan, many diﬀer-
ent branching topologies are possible. Figure 8 also shows a
structure of the Gal5-glycoform, which corresponds to the
known sequence of the sVSG117 Gal5-glycoform (Mehlert et
al. 1998). This structure was supported by the double-cleavage
ion observed at m/z 839.4 [(Me-Hex)2(Hex)2-28 + Na]+, indi-
cating an additional hexose attached to the middle mannose
of the GPI anchor core. The presence of glycosidic cleavage
ions at m/z 871.4 (C-type ion) and 853.5 (B-type ion) conﬁrmed
the structural feature of a side chain consisting of four hexose
residues. However, no ion was detected that could describe a
branching point within the side chain unambiguously. Cross-
ring fragments were less abundant and had lower intensities
when compared to the CID spectra of the Gal3- and Gal4-glyco-
forms. Due to their very weak signals, they were not analyzed
further.

GC-MS methylation linkage analysis of sVSG121 GPI
glycoforms
In order to conﬁrm the types of linkages assigned for the Gal3-
and Gal4-glycoforms, a GC-MS methylation linkage analysis
was performed using the sVSG121 glycan mixture. The per-
methylated glycans were hydrolysed, reduced and acetylated
to form partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs), as de-
scribed in Ferguson (1994). The PMAAs were resolved by
GC-MS (Agilent). The chromatogram (not shown) revealed
the presence of a minimum of one terminal mannose, one
terminal galactose, one 2-O-substituted mannose, one 2-O-sub-
stituted galactose, one 6-substituted galactose, one 2,3-
disubstituted mannose, one 3,6-disubstituted mannose and
one 2,6-disubstituted galactose. Figure 9 shows the largest of
the structures of the sVSG121 neutral glycans consistent with
their GC-MS analysis and previous analyses of GPI anchors
from other VSG variants (Ferguson et al. 1988; Mehlert et
al. 1998). Sequence, branching and linkage types were consis-
tent with the proposed structures of ions found by CID-MS.
Since cross-ring rupture ions of permethylated glycans cannot
provide structural information of 1→3 linkages (Reinhold et al.
1995), 3-substituted hexoses could not be detected by CID-
MS. Cross-ring cleavage fragments of terminal hexoses were
also absent in the CID-MS spectra, possibly due to the very
weak signal of the [Me-Hex + Na]+- precursor ions. The
anomeric conﬁgurations of the sugar residue that are given
in Figure 9 are taken from the fully characterized sVSG221
GPI anchor (Mehlert et al. 1998) and cannot be determined
by either GC-MS or CID-MS.

Discussion

Here, we describe the use of soft ionization electrospray mass
spectrometry as a powerful technique for structural character-
ization of glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors
from low picomole amounts of material. We show that se-
quence, branching and some linkage details of GPI glycans
can be deduced from ES-MS/MS data and that these assign-
ments are consistent with previous research on structural
characterization of GPI anchors from T. brucei (Ferguson et
al. 1988; Mehlert et al. 1998). Our method involved the per-

methylation of GPI membrane anchor glycans, which is the
most important type of derivatization used in oligosaccharide
MS (North et al. 2009) followed by positive ion ES-MS and
CID-MS. The ES-MS data alone revealed the composition of
three diﬀerent galactose glycoforms of the sVSG121 variant
GPI glycan structure (Gal3–Gal5), which ionized as doubly
charged sodium adducts [M + Na]2+. Collision-induced disso-
ciation provided sequences information by producing
characteristic glycosidic cleavage ions. Taking into account
the conserved Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4GlcN motif found

583

I R E Nett et al.

in almost all GPI structures (Fankhauser et al. 1993), the se-
quence information could be reﬁned and ﬁtted to a model of
a core sequence of Man–Man–Man–GlcN–Ino substituted
with Gal residues. Sequence information regarding the branch-
ing pattern of the GPI anchor galactose residues around the
mannose core of the diﬀerent glycoforms could also be ob-
tained by ES-MS/MS. Double glycosidic cleavage ions
revealed the presence of branched and linear galactose side
chains from one up to ﬁve residues. However, due to the am-
biguity of some glycosidic fragment ions, especially when
analyzing more complex glycan structures (e.g. Gal5-glyco-
form of sVSG121), complementary analytical methods have
to be taken into consideration. The data also provided an indi-
cation of hexose linkage composition by observing cross-ring
fragment ions of the permethylated GPI glycans, which was
consistent with results obtained by GC-MS analysis from the
same material. Cross-ring cleavage ions deﬁned the linkage
types within the conserved Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4GlcN
core, except for terminal hexoses, which is possibly due to
the very weak signals of the [Me-Hex + Na]+- product ions
by ES-MS/MS.

Modern ultra-high sensitive mass spectrometry is commonly
used for screening samples for speciﬁc classes of analytes. In
recent years, MS strategies for screening diﬀerent types of oli-
gosaccharides present in a diverse range of biological materials
have been developed to investigate the glycome (North et al.
2009). Often, these methods are based on the analysis of per-
methylated oligosaccharides and detection of characteristic
product ions upon fragmentation. A triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer is well suited to screen for the presence of ana-
lytes via the use of constant neutral loss and precursor ion scan
modes. Unfortunately, sensitive screening for permethylated
GPI glycans in complex biological samples using neutral loss
scanning is ruled out by the fact that the most abundant report-
er ions generated by collision-induced dissociation result from
a non-neutral loss of the D-myo-inositol residue together with
the quaternary ammonium ion of the derivatized glucosamine.
The principal mass transition for each permethylated GPI gly-
can is, therefore, from the doubly charged [M + Na]2+
precursor ion to singly charged [(M − 292) + Na]+ ion, making
the transition diﬀerent for each value of M. On the other hand,
calculated [M + Na]2+ to [(M − 292) + Na]+ transitions can
be used to build multiple reaction monitoring methods to
sensitively search for permethylated GPI glycans of predeter-
mined composition. The scope for precursor ion scanning for
permethylated GPIs is also limited by the aforementioned
dominant non-neutral loss. Thus, the intensities of all of
the other product ions are relatively low (note that in the
spectra shown in Figures 4, 6 and 8 the y-axis is magniﬁed
ﬁve, three and eight times, respectively, relative to the
1451.5, 1655.5 and 1859.7 [(M – 292) + Na]+ product ions).
Furthermore, product ions that are common to all or most
permethylated GPI glycans also tend to be rather nonspecif-
ic; for example, the [Me-Hex2 + Na]+, [Hex3 + Na]+ and
[Hex4 + Na]+ product ions at m/z 445, 635 and 839, respec-
tively, could also belong to permethylated oligomannose N-
linked glycans.

While this study has focused on Q-Tof MS2 experiments, we
are aware that many laboratories now have access to ion trap
instruments capable of MS3 and higher-order experiments. We

have only begun to explore the potential of this type of meth-
odology to resolve some of the ambiguities referred to in the
MS2 interpretations herein, but it should, in many cases, re-
solve alternative branching structures. One such example
was recently published by us (Izquierdo et al. 2009), where
isolation of [(M − 292) + 2 Na]2+ ions, derived from two
isobaric [M + 2 Na]3+ permethylated GPI glycan precursor
ions, generated unique and highly informative MS3 product
ion spectra that discriminated two alternative side-chain
branching patterns.

Materials and methods
Materials
Sephacryl S200 and QAE-Sephadex A-25 were supplied by
Pharmacia, DEAE-cellulose (DE52) by Whatman, Bio-Gel
P4 and AG 50W-X12 resin by Bio-Rad, HiTrap SP HP ion ex-
change column by Amershan Bioscience, 2 ml glass vials,
dimethyl sulfoxide and methyl iodide by Sigma-Aldrich and
HPTLC plates and Pronase protease from Merck. All other sol-
vents (HPLC grade) were from VWR.

Purification of sVSG121
sVSG MITat.1.6 (also known as variant 121) was puriﬁed from
bloodstream form T. brucei strain 427 variant MITat.1.6 cells
using hypotonic lysis and DE52 chromatography, as described
by Cross (1984). The VSG was further puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration
using Sephacryl S200 column (4 × 90 cm) equilibrated with
0.1 M NH4HCO3. Typically, 10 mg freeze-dried sVSG was ob-
tained from 1010 cells.

Preparation of the sVSG MITat.1.6 GPI neutral glycans
Approximately 1 mg of sVSG121 was treated with 50 µl 50%
aqueous HF (48 h at 0°C), freeze-dried (Micro Modulyo), re-
suspended in 50 µl water and sonicated for 15 min
(Ultrasonics Ltd.). The insoluble material was removed by
centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 5 min) and washed twice with
20 µl water. The combined supernatants were transferred into
a 2-ml glass vial and dried in a Speedvac concentrator (Stra-
tech Scientiﬁc). After addition of 50 µl methanol and drying,
the GPI glycans were used for permethylation.

GPI glycan permethylation
The GPI glycans were resuspended in 50 µl dimethyl sulfox-
ide, left for 20 min at room temperature and deprotonated by
adding a solution of 120 mg/ml sodium hydroxide in dimethyl
sulfoxide (20 min). Methyl iodide was added in three intervals
over a total of 30 min (10 µl, 10 min incubation; another 10 µl,
10 min incubation, then 20 µl, 10 min incubation), and the per-
methylation reaction was continued for another 30 min. The
permethylated glycans were partitioned between 250 µl chlo-
roform and 1 ml of 100 mg/ml sodium thiosulphate in water.
The upper aqueous phase was removed and the chloroform
phase re-extracted six times with 1 ml of water each. The per-
methylated glycans recovered in the lower chloroform phase
were transferred into a new glass vial, dried under N2 and re-
dissolved in 200 µl of 80% acetonitrile, 0.5 mM sodium
acetate for ES-MS analysis.

Electrospray mass spectrometry
Mass spectrometric data was acquired on a Q-Tof2TM
(Micromass) hybrid quadrupole time-of-ﬂight instrument.
Mass spectra were recorded by linear scanning over a range
of m/z 500–2500. Several scans were summed from a 4 µl
introduction of sample solution (100 pmol µl−1 of sVSG121
glycan) in 80% acetonitrile containing 0.5 mM sodium acte-
tate using type-F nanotips (Micromass). The data acquired
were averaged and processed using the Mass-Lynx software
supplied with the instrument. Positive ion spectra were re-
corded with a tip voltage of 1 kV and a cone voltage of
35–50 V. Fragment ion spectra from the doubly charged
pseudomolecular ions were obtained by collision-induced
fragmentation in the collision cell using argon as the collision
gas at a pressure of 1 bar. The CID mass spectra were re-
corded by linear scanning over the m/z range 200–2200.
Glu-ﬁbrinopeptide B (Glu-ﬁb) was used as an internal stan-
dard for mass calibration at 1 pmol µl−1 in 90% acetonitrile
containing 0.1% formic acid.
