(Received  September  28,  2010.  Accepted  October  21,  2010)

This  study  describes  two  new  records  of  the  lichen  genus  Placynthiella  (P.  hyporhoda  and  P.  icmalea)  from  South  Korea.
A  brief  taxonomic  description  and  comments  are  provided  for  the  new  records.  An  artificial  key  is  also  provided  for  known
species  of  this  genus  in  South  Korea.

KEYWORDS : Biodiversity,  New  records,  Taxonomy,  Trapeliaceae

The lichen genus Placynthiella, with seven species world-
wide, belongs to the family Trapeliaceae [1]. The genus is
characterized  by  crustose,  effuse,  granular-verrucose  or
isidiate-granular, brownish to blackish thallus; biatorine to
lecideine,  red-brown  to  black  apothecia;  pseudoparenchy-
matous  exciple;  dark  brown  epihymenium;  colorless  to
pale brown hymenium; brown hypothecium; Trapelia-type
asci  with  8  ascospores  that  are  simple  (rarely  1-septate),
hyaline,  ellipsoid;  simple  to  abundantly  branched  para-
physes  with  dark  brown  to  red-brown  apically  swollen
tips.

A  single  species  of  this  genus  [P.  uliginosa  (Schrad.)
Coppins & P. James] has been reported from South Korea
[2]. After examining the herbarium material housed at the
Korean Lichen Research Institute (KoLRI), we found two
additional taxa belonging to this genus: P. hyporhoda (Th.
Fr.) Coppins & P. James and P. icmalea (Ach.) Coppins &
P.  James.  A  brief  taxonomic  description  along  with  the
chemistry,  ecological  data,  and  illustrations  are  provided.
A  key  to  all  known  taxa  of  Placynthiella  in  South  Korea
is also provided.

Specimens  were  examined  using  standard  microscopi-
cal techniques and were hand-sectioned under a Nikon C-
PS 1068908 dissecting microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
All measurements were performed on material mounted in
water,  and  lactophenol  cotton  blue  was  used  only  as  a
stain.  Anatomical  descriptions  based  on  these  prepara-
tions were made under a Nikon Eclipse E 200 compound
microscope.  Measurements  of  thallus  layers,  apothecia,
and ascospores were made at ×400 and ×1,000 magnifica-
tions.  Spot  test  reactions  were  performed  on  hand  sec-
tions  of  thalli  and  apothecia  under  a  microscope  (BX  50;
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Secondary metabolites were iden-
tified by standard thin layer chromatography, as described
by Orange et al. [3] using solvent system C.

Taxonomic  Treatment  of  the  Species

Placynthiella  hyporhoda  (Th.  Fr.)  Coppins  &  P.  James
(Fig. 1A)
Lichenologist 16: 244 (1984).

Diagnostic  characters. Thallus  terricolous,  compact  to
verruculose,  of  irregular  granules  that  coalesce  to  form  a
continuous to ± areolate crust, subgelatinous, dark brown.
Apothecia  usually  abundant,  often  coalescing,  rounded  to
slightly  deformed,  sessile  or  immersed  among  verrucules,
0.2~0.3  (~0.4)  mm  in  diameter,  disc  blackish  (even  when
moist), flat to weakly convex, margin soon excluded. Epi-
hymenium brown. Hymenium pale to dark brown. Hypoth-
ecium  dark  brown.  Asci  8-spored,  ascospores  hyaline,
ellipsoid, simple, 9.5~12 × 4~5 µm.

Chemistry. Spot tests: thallus K−, C−, KC−, Pd−. Hyme-
nium  I+  reddish-orange.  Hypothecium  K+  purple-violet.
Secondary metabolites: none detected.

Ecology. This species was found growing on acidic soil
at an elevation of 550 m.

Geographical  distribution. Europe,  Scandinavia,  North
America [4, 5].

Remarks. This species is characterized by a C−, subgelat-
inous,  non-coralloid,  granular  thallus;  numerous  dark
black  apothecia  and  a  deep  brown-red  hypothecium  that
reacts K+ purple-violet. Placynthiella icmalea and P. ulig-
inosa,  the  other  known  Placynthiella  species  from  South
Korea,  should  not  be  confused  with  P.  hyporhoda.  The
K+ reddish-brown reaction of the hypothecium in case of
P. uliginosa separates it from P. hyporhoda, whereas pres-
ence  of  isidioid  granules,  C+  red  reaction  of  the  thallus,
and secondary  metabolites in  P.  icmalea  separates  it from

Placynthiella  icmalea  (Ach.)  Coppins  &  P.  James  (Fig.
1B)
Lichenologist 16: 244 (1984).

Diagnostic  characters. Thallus  corticolous,  continuous,
effuse,  composed  of  isidiate  to  minutely  coralloid-elon-
gated  granules,  greenish-  or  blackish-brown.  Apothecia
common,  scattered,  rarely  crowded  and  confluent,  sessile
or immersed among granules, 0.2~0.3 (~0.4) mm in diameter,
disc brownish-black (even when moist), flat, margin paler
than the disc, thin.  Epihymenium  brown. Hymenium  pale
brown.  Hypothecium  pale  brown.  Asci  8-spored,  ascospores
hyaline, ellipsoid, simple, 8~12 × 4~5 µm.

Chemistry. Spot tests: thallus K−, C+ red, KC+ red, Pd−.
Hymenium  I+  reddish-orange.  Hypothecium  K−.  Second-
ary metabolites: gyrophoric acid.

Ecology. This  species  was  found  growing  between  ele-
vations of 115 to 970 m on Zelkova bark and dead wood.

Geographical  distribution. Antarctica,  Europe,  Maca-
ronesia, North America, Asia, Africa, Australia [4, 6, 7].

Remarks. This species is characterized by a wide-spread-
ing  brown,  isidiate  crust  growing  among  other  lichens.  It
is easily demarcated form other known South Korean Pla-
cynthiella  species  by  bearing  isidiate-coralloid  goniocysts
and  the  C+  red  reaction  of  the  thallus  due  to  presence  of
gyrophoric acid.
