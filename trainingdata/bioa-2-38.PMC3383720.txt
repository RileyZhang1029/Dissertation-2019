Manipulation of the actin cytoskele-

ton is a commonly used process by
which bacterial pathogens and viruses are
able to neutralize host defense mecha-
nisms and subvert them in order to repli-
cate in a hostile environment. Diverse
bacteria display a wide array of mechan-
isms of regulation of microfilaments to
enter, move within or exit the host cell. A
less studied subject is how pathogens may
co-opt the actin cytoskeleton to disturb
vesicle trafficking pathways, namely pha-
golysosomal fusion, and avoid degrada-
tion. In fact, although actin plays a role in
endosomal
trafficking and phagosome
maturation, the knowledge on the exact
mechanisms and additional players is still
scarce. Recently, we found that
the
Legionella pneumophila virulence factor
VipA is an actin nucleator, associates with
actin filaments and early endosomes
during infection, and interferes in yeast
organelle trafficking pathways, suggesting
it may be linking actin dynamics to
endosome biogenesis. Further studies on
this protein,
together with work on
other bacterial effectors, may help shed
light in the role of actin in endosomal
maturation.

Introduction

Over long processes of coevolution, micro-
bial pathogens have developed a multitude
of mechanisms to survive and replicate in
the host organism. They have not only
neutralized host cell pathways that would
ultimately lead to their killing, but have
also hijacked eukaryotic networks for their
own benefit. Depending on the pathogen

displaying or not an obligatory intra-
cellular phase during the life cycle, these
mechanisms may yield responses as diverse
and contrasting as promotion or preven-
tion of fundamental eukaryotic processes,
such as phagocytosis, apoptosis, autophagy
or vesicle trafficking. In order to modulate
these pathways, bacterial pathogens inject
into the host cell virulence factors, or
effector proteins, through secretion systems.
These effectors act by targeting specific
eukaryotic components, regulating their
subcellular localization and/or activity.

that
repertoire of virulence
mechanisms acquired during coevolution
with protozoa has made L. pneumophila
competent for infection of human lung
macrophages, leading to a frequently fatal
type of pneumonia known as Legionnaires’
disease. Legionellae thrive in a remodeled
compartment
the
Legionella-containing
(LCV).
Immediately after uptake, the LCV avoids
the endocytic pathway and sequentially
recruits vesicles trafficking between the
ER and the Golgi, mitochondria and
ribosomes, becoming a rough ER-like
compartment. In this modified niche the
bacteria divide until they finally exit the
host cell, either by lytic or non-lytic
egress mechanisms. Fundamental to these

called Icm/Dot, which trans-
locates over 300 effectors into the host
cell.1 A particular feature of the Legionella
effector repertoire is its functional redund-
ancy, which derives
from the absence
of infection-related phenotypes when one
or more of the effector encoding genes
are deleted, and therefore complicates the
assessment of their role during infection.
Nevertheless, during recent years func-
tions have been assigned to a number of
them in targeting host cell processes such
as apoptosis, the NFkB pathway or the
secretory pathway (for more detailed
reviews on Legionella effector
function

Pathogen Invasion and Actin

as a (Cyto)skeleton Key

avoiding phagocytosis

As actin is one of the most abundant
eukaryotic proteins and used in a great
variety of structural and regulatory func-
tions in the cell, it is not surprising that
the actin cytoskeleton is a major target of
pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Co-opting
actin dynamics is fundamental in diverse
steps of
the infection cycle, both for
extracellular and intracellular pathogens.
Phagocytosis by immune system cells is
the first defense mechanism triggered by
the host
to fight a pathogen. Some
extracellular bacteria such as Yersinia use
effectors to cripple the actin machinery,
thus
and con-
sequent degradation, while E. coli patho-
genic strains hijack the actin cytoskeleton
to form an actin pedestal in the site of
adhesion,

cycle, and Vibrio promotes microfilament
rearrangements disrupting cellular
tight
junctions in order to disturb the epithelial
barrier.
some intracellular
pathogens, namely Salmonella, Shigella
and Listeria,
stimulate actin rearrange-
ments to promote their own engulfment
into otherwise non-phagocytic cells. Once
inside the cell, pathogens like Listeria or
Rickettsia evade the phagosome and are
able to move within the host cell cytosol
and spread to neighboring cells, by trigger-
ing the formation of actin comet tails in
one pole of the bacterial cell. Vacuolar
pathogens, on the other hand, have to

niche viable for
replication. However,
although actin has been shown to play a
role in processes such as the biogenesis
of the Chlamydia inclusion or in enhanc-
ing the translocation of type III secretion
substrates, relatively less is known about
its importance in the establishment of a
replicative niche that allows for microbe
replication (for references and pathogen
subversion of other cytoskeleton compo-
nents please consult recent comprehensive
reviews on this topic by4-6).

Actin cytoskeleton dynamics also play a
fundamental role in Legionella infection.
Actin remodeling is essential for phago-
cytic uptake and several actin-binding
proteins have been implicated in the entry
process, such as coronin, villidin, a-actinin
and filamin.7 Analysis of
the composi-
tion of the LCV during infection of D.
discoideum has identified, in addition to
actin, many other actin related proteins at
later times post infection such as coronin,
cofilin, myosin II and profilin, Arp2/3
components, actin bundling and capping
proteins.8,9 However, the function of all
these actin related proteins on the LCV
membrane and the cross-talk between
L. pneumophila effectors and the host actin
cytoskeleton components has
remained
for the most part elusive.

To date, only a small number of bac-
terial actin nucleators have been identified
and characterized (Fig. 1). Chlamydia
Tarp and Salmonella SipC are involved
in actin-mediated uptake of the pathogen,
while Rickettsia Sca2 is a formin-like nu-
cleator that mediates intracellular move-
ment of the bacterium via polymerization
of actin comet tails.12-14 In addition, the

nositide phosphatase SopB plays multiple
roles during infection.
In addition to
mediating actin-dependent internalization
of the bacteria, it also prevents the trans-
ition of PI(3)P to PI(3,5)P in the Salmo-
nella containing vacuole (SCV) membrane
and therefore may contribute to arresting
SCV maturation along the endosomal

coli (EPEC) EspF nucleates a multiprotein
complex containing the Arp2/3 activator
N-WASP and the endocytic regulator
sorting nexin 9 (SNX9), which mediates
clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Although
the mechanism or pathogenic significance
of this has not been yet elucidated, EspF
has been proposed to alter SNX9 regu-
lation of endocytosis during EPEC infec-
tion, leading to the formation of aberrant
tubular vesicles.20-22

polymerization. In Chlamydia, a cooperative mechanism leading to the formation of cell protrusions and invasion has been proposed, in which Tarp
nucleates short actin filaments and when phosphorylated also leads to the recruitment of Arp2/3 via Rac signaling.12,30 Salmonella SipC promotes entry

Syntaxin-6, which in turn binds lysosomal LAMP-113,31. The formin-like Sca2 nucleator from Rickettsia leads to the formation of actin comet tails,
which enable the movement of the pathogen within the host cell cytosol, as well as invasion of neighboring cells.14 Vibrio cholerae VopF and Vibrio
parahaemolyticus VopL (and ortholog VopN from V. cholerae) lead to membrane protrusions and formation of stress fibers, respectively, implicated
in disruption of tight junctions and consequent epithelial integrity.15,16,32 In addition to nucleating actin filaments, L. pneumophila VipA binds early
endosomes and may play a role in the endocytic pathway.10

Aip1) is an adaptor protein with multiple
functions and binding partners. It associ-
ates with actin, tubulins, focal adhesion
kinase (FAK), Src and proline-rich tyrosine
kinase 2 (PYK-2). It is involved in the
actin-dependent positioning of endosomes
by connecting these organelles
to the
cortical actin cytoskeleton.23,24 In addition,
it
interacts with ESCRT components,
being involved in the MVB Pathway and
thus playing a role in related processes
such as EGFR downregulation, HIV
budding and also cytokinesis.25,26

Annexins have also been implicated in a
dual function as modulators of endosomal
trafficking and actin dynamics. Annexin

A6 is a Ca2+-dependent protein that binds
lipid rafts in the plasma membrane and
endosomes. It also binds F-actin, presum-
ably acting as a scaffold link between
membrane microdomains and the cyto-
skeleton, and regulating transient mem-
brane-actin interactions during endocytic
and exocytic transport.27,28 The related
protein annexin A2 plays a role in early to
late endosome transport. Together with
Spire1 and Arp2/3, it is involved in MVB
formation, by nucleating actin patches in
early endosomes that are responsible for
the actin-dependent endosome biogenesis,
presumably by driving the membrane
remodeling process.29

endosome-specific

Recent insights into actin regulation of
endosome biogenesis came from studies
on the Arp2/3 activators WASH and
N-WASP. Both play a role in endocytic
trafficking, although their functions seem
to be temporally and spatially distinct.

to function in previous and subsequent
endocytic events, by promoting the inter-
nalization of plasma membrane patches
and later actin-mediated vesicle propul-
sion through the cytoplasm (reviewed in
ref. 4).

Future Perspectives

The localization of VipA to endosomes
and its effect on MVB trafficking suggest
a role in endosome biogenesis. In the
context of a Legionella infection, a possible

goal would be a modulation of
the
interaction of the LCV with the endocytic
machinery, thus aiding in preventing its
delivery and degradation in the lysosome.
Alternative functions related to the MVB
pathway could be a disturbance in the
adaptive immune response, by interfering
with antigen presentation, or
in the
regulation of membrane lipid and protein
composition. In the past, many eukaryo-
tic cell pathways and protein functions
have been elucidated by
studies on
