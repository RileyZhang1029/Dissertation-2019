The biogeochemistry of phyllosilicate–Fe redox cycling was studied in a Phalaris arundi-
nacea (reed canary grass) dominated redoximorphic soil from Shovelers Sink, a small glacial
depression near Madison, WI.The clay size fraction of Shovelers Sink soil accounts for 16%
of the dry weight of the soil, yet contributes 74% of total Fe. The dominant mineral in the
clay size fraction is mixed layer illite–smectite, and in contrast to many other soils and sed-
iments, Fe(III) oxides are present in low abundance. We examined the Fe biogeochemistry
of Shovelers Sink soils, estimated the abundance of Fe redox cycling microorganisms, and
isolated in pure culture representative phyllosilicate–Fe oxidizing and reducing organisms.
The abundance of phyllosilicate–Fe reducing and oxidizing organisms was low compared to
culturable aerobic heterotrophs. Both direct isolation and dilution-to-extinction approaches
using structural Fe(II) in Bancroft biotite as a Fe(II) source, and O2 as the electron acceptor,
resulted in recovery of common rhizosphere organisms including Bradyrhizobium spp. and
strains of Cupriavidus necator and Ralstonia solanacearum. In addition to oxidizing biotite
and soluble Fe(II) with O2, each of these isolates was able to oxidize Fe(II) in reduced NAu-
−
2 smectite with NO
3 as the electron acceptor. Oxidized NAu-2 smectite or amorphous
Fe(III) oxide served as electron acceptors for enrichment and isolation of Fe(III)-reducing
microorganisms, resulting in recovery of a strain related to Geobacter toluenoxydans. The
ability of the recovered microorganisms to cycle phyllosilicate–Fe was veriﬁed in an exper-
iment with native Shovelers Sink clay. This study conﬁrms that Fe in the native Shovelers
Sink clay is readily available for microbial redox transformation and can be cycled by the
Fe(III)-reducing and Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms recovered from the soil.

INTRODUCTION
Clay size Fe-bearing phyllosilicate phases, along with Fe(III)
hydroxides, play a central role in the Fe redox biogeochemistry
in natural environments (Amonette, 2002). These two groups
of Fe-bearing minerals have contrasting geochemical behavior.
Reduction of Fe(III) hydroxides typically results in Fe(II) mobi-
lization, with the potential for redistribution of Fe via diffu-
sion/dispersion and pore ﬂuid advection. In contrast, structural
Fe in clay minerals can undergo multiple redox cycles without
being mobilized, because Fe remains within the mineral structure
and within the system (Dong et al., 2009; Stucki, 2011). Multiple
Fe(III) hydroxide reducing and soluble Fe(II)-oxidizing organ-
isms are available as model microbial agents (Lovley et al., 2004;
Weber et al., 2006; Emerson et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2010;
Konhauser et al., 2011). Much less is known about microorgan-
isms involved in phyllosilicate–Fe redox cycling. When 10 Fe(III)-
reducing organisms [enriched and isolated with Fe(III) hydroxide
as the sole electron acceptor] were tested for growth on a model
ferruginous smectite, only eight could reduce structural Fe(III)
in the smectite (Kasheﬁ et al., 2008). These ﬁndings suggest that

phyllosilicate–Fe(III)-reducing and Fe(III) (hydr)oxide-reducing
microbial populations may not always overlap. Even less is known
about organisms capable of oxidizing structural Fe(II) in smectite.
The only culture known to catalyze this reaction is a strain of Desul-
ﬁtobacterium hafniense (formerly D. frappieri) isolated from a
−
subsurface smectite bedding, which is capable of NO
3 -dependent
structural Fe(II) oxidation (Shelobolina et al., 2003).

The coexistence and aggregation of Fe-bearing phyllosilicates
and Fe(III) hydroxides makes it challenging to study the redox
cycling of phyllosilicate–Fe in many soils and sediments. Certain
non-highly weathered soils, however, may be enriched in phyl-
losilicates relative to Fe and Al oxides (Brady and Weil, 2008). The
loess-derived silty clay loam deposits at Shovelers Sink, near Madi-
son, WI, USA (Clayton and Attig, 1997; Bradbury, 2001) provide
an excellent example of this type of soil environment. Shovel-
ers Sink is a small, permanent, remnant glacial depression which
originated as a proglacial lake fed by water draining off ice when
glaciers covered the Madison area about 15,000 years ago (Clay-
ton and Attig, 1997; Bradbury, 2001). At present Shovelers Sink is
a wetland managed as a wildlife conservancy area. The dominant

Phyllosilicate–Fe redox cycling microorganisms

plant species at Shovelers Sink is Phalaris arundinacea (reed canary
grass, RCG), which forms a dense, up to 1 m deep root system that
is tolerant to prolonged anoxia during times of soil saturation (Bar-
clay and Crawford, 1983). The redoximorphic conditions and high
abundance of Fe-bearing phyllosilicates relative to Fe(III) oxides
makes Shovelers Sink an ideal setting to study the biogeochem-
istry of phyllosilicate–Fe redox cycling. The aim of this study was
to characterize the biogeochemistry and mineralogy of Shovelers
Sink soil, and to enumerate and isolate microorganisms capable
of reducing or oxidizing phyllosilicate–Fe.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STUDY SITE AND SAMPLE COLLECTION
Soil and groundwater samples were collected from Shovelers Sink
site located in the Cross Plains unit of the Ice Age National Scien-
tiﬁc Reserve, c.a. 50 m from Mineral Point Road and 17 m from
the pond. Soils were collected (January 2007, July 2007, June 2008,
and September 2009) with a stainless steel coring device. Fluid
from below the water table was collected in 50-ml plastic tubes.
Core sections were placed in sterile sample collection plastic bags
and immediately delivered to the laboratory. All core sections were
placed into an anaerobic chamber ﬁlled with N2:H2 mix (95:5),
homogenized, and dispensed into serum bottles or pressure tubes
for immediate experimentation, or into large Pyrex bottles with
thick rubber stoppers for storage and/or later use. After removal
from the anaerobic chamber, all bottles were ﬂushed with O2-free
N2 (passed over reduced, hot copper ﬁlings) to remove H2 from
the headspace. Soil water was ﬁltered through a 0.2-μm syringe
ﬁlter and frozen prior to analysis by ion chromatography.

SEPARATION AND ANALYSIS OF GRAIN SIZE FRACTIONS
Soils were size fractionated by wet-sieving and centrifugation
(Jackson, 1969; Gee and Bauder, 1986). Wet-sieving was performed
in the anaerobic chamber using water made anoxic by bubbling
with N2. 1000 ml Pyrex bottles containing 900 ml water each were
bubbled for 2 h. No gravel size particles (>2 mm) were found in
the materials. Sand (50 μm–2 mm) size materials were removed
by sieving (USA Standard Testing Sieves, VWR Scientiﬁc). The
remaining silt (2 μm–50 μm) and clay (<2 μm) grain size frac-
tions were separated by centrifugation in sealed plastic bottles
under N2. The settling time for the clay size fraction was calcu-
lated for a particle density of 2.6 g/cm3 using Stokes’ Law. A small
portion of each size fraction was used to determine the dry weight
per unit volume of soil suspension. These subsamples were dried
at 105˚C and wet/dry sample weight factors were calculated from
weight differences before and after drying.

Total Fe(II) and Fe(III) in the size fractions was determined
by the hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) extraction followed by the 1,10-
Phenanthroline assay as described by Stucki (1981) and modiﬁed
by Komadel and Stucki (1988). Fe(III) oxyhydroxide contents were
determined by citrate–bicarbonate–dithionite (CDB) extraction
(Mehra and Jackson, 1980) and ferrozine analysis (Stookey, 1970).
All Fe measurements were performed in triplicate. Organic carbon
was measured with a Leco CHN analyzer at the UW–Madison Soil
and Plant Analysis Laboratory.

DETERMINATION OF STEADY STATE H2 CONCENTRATIONS
To determine steady state dissolved H2 concentration in the pore-
water within representative soil samples, c.a. 30 g of each sample

were placed into 60 ml serum bottles under an N2 atmosphere.
H2 concentration in the headspace was monitored over time with
a reduction gas analyzer (ta3000 Gas Analyzer, Trace Analytical,
Ametek) until stability was reached.

TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
Transition electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were carried
out using a FEI Titan 80–200 aberration corrected scan-
ning/transmission electron microscope associated with an EDAX
AMETEK high resolution energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) detector and Gatan image ﬁltering system, and operated at
200 kV. The samples were mixed with distilled water and ultrason-
icated for ∼3 min. A drop of the resulting suspension was placed
on a lacey-carbon coated Cu grid and air-dried.

X-RAY DIFFRACTION
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were done using a Scintag Pad
V Diffractometer with CuKα radiation. The instrument used an
accelerating voltage of 45 kV, a current of 40 mA, a 2-mm diver-
gence slit, 4-mm incident scatter slit, 1-mm diffracted beam scatter
slit, and 0.5-mm receiving slit. Scan parameters used were a step
size of 0.02˚ and a dwelling time of 2 s. Oriented aggregate mounts
were prepared by pasting clay-DI water suspension on glass slides
and air drying. A drop of ethylene glycol was added directly to the
surface of the oriented clay mount with a glass rod for ethylene
glycol treatment. Oriented aggregate mounts were heated at 550˚C
for 3 h in the furnace for heat treatment.

MOST PROBABLE NUMBER ANALYSIS
Microorganisms were enumerated by the most probable num-
ber (MPN) method (Woomer, 1994). Strict anaerobic laboratory
technique (Miller and Wolin, 1974) was used to quantify anaer-
obic Fe(III)-reducing bacteria. An anaerobic basal bicarbonate-
buffered freshwater (FW) medium (Lovley and Phillips, 1988)
was dispensed into 27 ml anaerobic pressure tubes (Bellco Glass,
Inc.) under N2/CO2 (80:20%). The tubes were capped with butyl
rubber stoppers and sterilized by autoclaving. The medium for
Fe(III)-reducing bacteria contained either 100 mM hydrous fer-
ric oxide (HFO) or 0.8 weight% of the Fe(III)-bearing smectite
NAu-2 [M +
)O20(OH)4 where M is the
interlayer cation; Keeling et al., 2000] as a terminal electron accep-
tor, H2 (3 ml ﬁltered H2 was added to the headspace) and acetate
(10 mM) as the combined electron donor, and 1.3 mM FeCl2 as
a reducing agent. The medium for Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria con-
tained O2 as the terminal electron acceptor (3 ml ﬁltered air added
to the headspace) and 1.1% Bancroft (Ward Scientiﬁc) biotite
[(K0.980, Na0.025; Fe2+
0.222Mg1.663, Ti0.117; Si3.048, Al0.812,
Ti0.140)O10(OH1.02, F0.98)] as a source of structural Fe(II). Aer-
obic heterotrophic bacteria were enumerated in medium contain-
ing (gram per liter) PIPES (piperazine-N,N
-bis-2-ethanesulfonic

acid) buffer (3.0), NH4Cl (0.25), NaH2PO4·H2O (0.06), KCl (0.1),

ISOLATION OF Fe(III)-REDUCING ORGANISMS
Smectite-containing MPN cultures were diluted in agarized
medium containing 20 mM fumarate and 20 mM acetate with a
roll-tube method (Hungate, 1968). An inoculum (1 ml) from the
10-fold serial dilutions of the enrichment culture in a liquid FW

medium was added to 27 ml pressure tubes containing 7 ml melted
medium. The contents were mixed gently and the pressure tubes
were rolled with a tube spinner. The roll-tubes were incubated ver-
tically at room temperature. Individual colonies were transferred
to the pressure tubes with 2 ml liquid FW medium containing
0.8% NAu-2 smectite as the electron acceptor and 10 mM acetate
as the electron donor.

ISOLATION OF Fe(II)-OXIDIZING ORGANISMS
Freshly collected samples and highest positive MPN dilution cul-
tures were serially diluted in biotite/O2-containing roll-tubes.
After orange and red colored individual colonies formed, they were
transferred to the pressure tubes with 2 ml liquid FW medium con-
taining 1.1% biotite and 3 ml ﬁltered air. Biotite oxidizing cultures
were serially diluted and plated on aerobic heterotrophic medium
using 1.5% agar as the solidifying agent.

Biotite oxidizing cultures were tested for their ability to grow
via microaerophilic FeCl2 oxidation. The cultures were grown on
a heterotrophic low-organic medium (0.01% yeast extract and
1 mM acetate, with 3 ml of ﬁltered air in the headspace), and
then transferred (5% vol/vol inoculum) to anoxic FW medium, to
which 1.3 mM FeCl2 and 1 ml ﬁltered air were added via syringe
and needle every other day. After 12 days of cultivation, cell num-
bers were determined. The aliquots of the culture were ﬁxed with
glutaraldehyde. The ﬁxed culture was reacted with ammonium
oxalate (28 g/l ammonium oxalate and 15 g/l oxalic acid) in the
presence of ca. 1 mM FeCl2 to dissolve Fe(III) hydroxides. Cells
were counted by acridine orange staining and epiﬂuorescence
microscopy (Hobbie et al., 1977).

MOLECULAR BIOLOGICAL METHODS
The16S rRNA gene sequences of the isolates and enrichment
cultures were obtained using standard methodologies as previ-
ously described (Shelobolina et al., 2007). 16S rRNA genes were
ampliﬁed using GM3 and GM4 primer set (Muyzer et al., 1995).
For enrichment cultures 16S rRNA genes were cloned using the
pGEM-T vector (Promega). The 16S rRNA gene fragments were
compared to the GenBank nucleotide database using BLASTN and
BLASTX algorithms (Altschul et al., 1990).

Fe CYCLING EXPERIMENT
An iron cycling experiment was performed in FW medium supple-
mented with natural Shovelers Sink clay. The clay suspension was
bubbled with air for 1 day to oxidize structural Fe(II), after which
the clay was dried and mixed with FW medium prior to bubbling
with N2:CO2 mix and autoclaving. XRD analysis of the clay before
and after autoclaving showed no difference suggesting no change
in the mineralogy of the clay (data not shown). A small amount
of acetate (0.25 mM) was provided as a limited source of electron
donor. Eighteen culture tubes were inoculated with G. toluenoxi-
dans strain sa2 isolated from Shovelers Sink soil, and three tubes
served as abiotic controls. Fe(III) reduction was allowed to pro-
−
ceed for 10 days. Five millimolar NO
3 was then added to 12 tubes,
and of these tubes nine were inoculated with Fe(II)-oxidizing iso-
lates with three uninoculated tubes serving as controls. No nitrate
or Fe(II)-oxidizing culture were added to three tubes in which
Fe(III) reduction was allowed to proceed for the rest of the exper-
iment. To evaluate the reaction of structural Fe(II) oxidation with

nitrite, three remaining tubes with reduced Shovelers Sink clay
were reacted with ca 2.0 mM nitrite.

Concentrations of 0.5 N HCl-extractable Fe(II), NO
3 , and

NO
2 were monitored over time. One milliliter of the culture
was centrifuged in the anaerobic chamber at 14 K rpm for 5 min.
−
The supernatant was collected for NO
2 and dissolved Fe
analysis. Samples for Fe analysis were acidiﬁed with HCl. The
remaining solids were mixed with 0.5 N HCl and extracted for
24 h. Fe(II) in the HCl extracts was quantiﬁed using the ferrozine
assay as previously described (Lovley and Phillips, 1986). Pre-
liminary studies demonstrated that a 24-h 0.5 N HCl extraction
released the same amount of Fe(II) from Shovelers Sink clay as HF
extraction (Stucki, 1981). Note that this equivalence applies only
to Fe(II), as only a small portion of structural Fe(III) is extracted
−

by 0.5 N HCl (Shelobolina et al., 2004). NO
2 concentra-
3 and NO
tions were measured with a Dionex DX-100 ion chromatograph
equipped with a AS4-SC IonPac column. Dissolved Fe concen-
trations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical
emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF SHOVELERS SINK SOIL
The soil at Shovelers Sink represents a silt loam interspersed with
RCG roots down to the depth of 105 cm (Figure 1). The depth
of the water table ranged from 60 to 80 cm. Soils collected in July
2007 were characterized in detail, at which time the water table
was located at c.a. 65 cm depth (Figure 2).

Organic carbon concentrations were highest within the main
root zone above 55 cm (1.7–2.5%), intermediate in the vicinity of
the water table (1.0–1.2%), and lowest below 80 cm (0.32–0.41%)
where few, if any, RCG roots were present (Figure 2B). Total HF-
extractable iron (Figure 2C) concentrations ranged between 196
and 333 mmol/kg and showed a trend opposite of that for organic
carbon, with Fe concentrations being lowest (166–190 mmol/kg)
above a depth of 55 cm, intermediate from the water table down
to 105 cm (230–249 mmol/kg), and highest below 105 cm (333–
337 mmol/kg). The fraction of total Fe present as Fe(II) was highly

variable above the water table (16–50%) and gradually decreased
from 38 to 32% below the water table (Figure 2D).

The spatial segregation of terminal electron accepting processes
in Shovelers Sink soil was assessed by measuring steady state
concentration of dissolved H2 in incubated soil samples from dif-
ferent depths, according to published criteria (Lovley and Good-
win, 1988; Lovley et al., 1994) and as described in a previous
study of clay-rich subsurface sediments (Shelobolina et al., 2004;
Figure 2A). Three TEAP zones could be distinguished: a mixed
metabolism zone above the water table (0–65 cm depth) character-
ized by a range of H2 concentrations from 1.6 to 10.2 nM; a dissim-
ilatory Fe(III)-reducing zone between 65 and 115 cm characterized
by H2 concentrations of 0.4–0.7 nM; and a methanogenic zone
below 115 cm with steady state H2 concentration of 8.1± 0.9 nM.

Shovelers Sink is a depression in which water balance is main-
tained through direct precipitation and runoff from the surround-
ing landscape. Runoff from nearby farms and households could
serve as an additional source of both organic carbon and elec-
−
−
tron acceptors, e.g., NO
3 , to the system. However, no NO
3 was
detected in ﬂuid from below the water table on any of the sampling
events. These results suggest that the localized zones of oxidation
observed in the soil (see Figure 1) are driven by release of O2 from
RGC roots, as is well-known for a variety of plants that proliferate
in water-logged soils (Armstrong, 1978). The observed redoximor-
phic features (Figure 1) and porewater steady state H2 concentra-
tions (Figure 2A) suggest ongoing Fe redox cycling at two scales:
(1) at the centimeter-to-decimeter scale within the transition from
saturated/anoxic to unsaturated/partially oxic conditions in the

vicinity of the water table; and (2) at the microscale around RCG
roots both above and below the water table. Soil from the vicinity
of the water table (c.a. 65 depth depth in July 2007) was cho-
sen to study microbial Fe redox cycling as it likely contained both
Fe(III)-reducing and Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms.

SOIL MINERALOGY
Soil collected from the vicinity of the water table in July 2007
was used to study the abundance and mineralogy of Fe in dif-
ferent grain size fractions. The contribution of silt and clay size
materials to total dry weight differed dramatically from their con-
tributions to total HF-extractable iron [Fe(II)+ Fe(III)] content
(Table 1). Although the silt size fraction dominated Shovelers Sink
soil by weight (83% of total dry weight), it contributed only 26%
total HF-extractable iron. In contrast, the clay size fraction, which
accounted only for 16% of the dry weight of soil, contributed 74%
of the total HF-extractable iron. These results demonstrate that
the majority of the Fe content of Shovelers Sink soil is contained
within the clay size fraction.

The mineralogy of silt and clay size fractions was character-
ized by conventional TEM, high resolution TEM (HRTEM), and
XRD (Figures 3–5). The following mineral phases were identiﬁed
(by TEM) in the silt size fraction: potassium feldspar, plagioclase,
quartz, and mixed layered illite–smectite aggregates (Figure 3).
Based on TEM and XRD analyses, the dominant mineral in the
clay size fraction was illite–smectite mixed layers (Figures 4 and
5). Clay size materials also contained kaolinite and illite as minor
components. No Fe(III) hydroxides were detected in either the

silt or clay size fractions during TEM observations. These results
are consistent with CDB extractions, which showed that the abun-
dance of Fe(III) oxides was ca. less than 5% of total HF-extractable
Fe in the bulk soil (Figure 2) and less than 2.5% in the clay
size fraction (Table 1). In summary, gravimetric, chemical, and
mineralogical analyses collectively suggest that mixed layer illite–
smectite is the geochemically dominant Fe-containing phase in
Shovelers Sink soil.

Small amounts of illite (I), kaolinite (Ka), and quartz (Qz) also exist. The

ethylene glycol treatment, and collapsed to 9.9 Å by heat treatment. The
7.2-Å [kaolinite (001)] and 3.6-A [kaolinite (002)] peaks in the untreated
sample disappeared by heating at 550˚C.

MPN ENUMERATIONS
Both Fe(III)-reducing and Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms were
detected in MPN enumerations conducted with soil samples
from near the water table in July 2007 and in September 2009.

Phyllosilicate–Fe redox cycling microorganisms

The abundance of Fe(III)-reducing organisms (2.4× 101 cells/g
wet soil in 2007 and 2.3× 100 cells/g wet soil in 2009) and
Fe(II)-oxidizing organisms (2.9× 102 cells/g wet soil
in 2007
and 2.4× 103 cells/g wet soil in 2009) was modest compared
total culturable aerobic heterotrophs
to the abundance of
(1.1× 106 cells/g wet soil in 2007 and 4.2× 105 cells/g wet soil
in 2009). Analogous results have been reported for groundwa-
ter seep environments supporting active Fe redox cycling (Blöthe
and Roden, 2009; Roden et al., submitted). Although the much
larger densities of culturable aerobic heterotrophs compared to
Fe(III)-reducers in these environments could suggest intense com-
petition between the two physiological groups (e.g., for utilization
of plant-derived organic materials), it is important to note that
previous studies have shown the persistence of large numbers
of aerobic bacteria in permanently anoxic environments (Jor-
gensen and Tiedje, 1993). Thus, the presence of high densities
of culturable aerobes in the Shoveler’s sink soil does not nec-
essarily mean that they contribute extensively to in situ carbon
metabolism.

Fe(II)-OXIDIZING ISOLATES
Fe(II)-oxidizing organisms were isolated from (1) soil samples col-
lected in July 2007, June 2008, and September 2009, and (2) the
highest positive dilutions from MPN studies set up in 2007 and
2009. Biotite was utilized as a solid phase form of Fe(II) for these
studies. Unlike reduced smectite, structural Fe(II) in biotite is not
subject to spontaneous reaction with O2, thus permitting the use
of O2 as the electron acceptor for lithotrophic Fe(II) oxidation.
−
Recent studies have demonstrated that the Fe(II)-oxidizing, NO
3
reducing culture described by Straub et al. (1996) can utilize Fe(II)
in biotite as a sole electron donor for chemolithotrophic growth
(Shelobolina et al., submitted). Samples and last positive MPN
dilution cultures were serially diluted in biotite-containing roll-
tubes. After solidiﬁcation 3 ml of ﬁlter sterilized air were added
to the headspace. Roll-tubes were incubated vertically at 20–22˚C
(room temperature). Over a period of 4–8 months, small (0.2–
0.5 mm) orange, or in some cases red, colonies formed between
the layer of biotite and the layer of agarized medium in a roll-tube.
Each colony was transferred to 2 ml liquid medium with biotite
provided as the electron donor and O2 as the electron acceptor. A
protracted (4 years) isolation effort (2007–2010) resulted in recov-
ery of 73 biotite oxidizing cultures, which were maintained on
liquid medium with biotite and O2. Eleven cultures capable of

oxidizing at least 5% of the structural Fe(II) content in biotite were
selected for further study. Culture subsamples were streaked onto
aerobic, low carbon medium culture plates. The resulting isolated
colonies could be either mixotrophic Fe(II)-oxidizing microorgan-
isms or heterotrophic contaminants. The numerically dominant
colony types were tested for microaerophilic growth with FeCl2
as a soluble Fe(II) sources. Cultures capable of growing to a den-
sity of at least 108 cells/ml with a total of c.a. 8 mM FeCl2 added
over time (see Materials and Methods) were identiﬁed by 16S
rRNA gene sequencing and selected for further study. The iso-
lates so obtained included Bradyrhizobium spp., and strains of
Ralstonia solanacearum, and Cupriavidus necator. One strain each
was chosen for further study (Table 2). Each of the cultures oxi-
dized 3–4% of structural Fe(II) in biotite with O2 as the electron
acceptor, and each was found to be capable of oxidizing chemi-
−
cally reduced smectite with NO
3 as the electron acceptor (data
not shown).

Fe(III)-REDUCING ISOLATE
Ferruginous NAu-2 smectite and hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) were
used to enrich Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms from Shovelers
Sink soil collected in July 2007 with acetate and H2 as combined
electron donors. Acetate and H2 were used as these represent the
two major sources of electron donor for microbial Fe(III) reduc-
tion in anoxic soils and sediments (Lovley et al., 2004). After
ca. 2 months of room temperature incubation, small (25 clones
each) 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed from 1%
enrichment cultures. Both enrichment cultures were dominated
by an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) 99% similar to Geobacter
toluenoxydans (Kunapuli et al., 2010). G. toluenoxydans strain sa2
was recovered using the roll-tube method with acetate as the elec-
tron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor. Strain sa2 can
conserve energy from dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction concomi-
tant with acetate oxidation using a variety of solid phase Fe(III)
sources, including Fe(III) hydroxide and ferruginous smectite, but
does not utilize nitrate as the electron acceptor.

MICROBIAL REDOX CYCLING OF Fe IN SHOVELERS SINK CLAY
A Fe redox cycling experiment was conducted with clay size mate-
rials isolated from Shovelers Sink soil collected from ca. 65 cm
depth in July 2007 (see Table 1). Although O2 is a likely elec-
tron acceptor for microbial Fe(II) oxidation at Shovelers Sink (see
−
above), NO
3 was utilized in this model experiment since it does

not react spontaneously with phyllosilicate-associated Fe(II). G.
toluenoxidans strain sa2 (5% vol/vol inoculum from a culture
grown previously for three transfers on limiting acetate/Shovelers
Sink clay medium, providing c.a. 106 cells/ml) reduced 2.1 mmol/l
Fe(II) over 7 days (Figure 6A). A small increase in aqueous
Fe concentration was detected in both abiotic control and the
Fe(III)-reducing cultures (35.4 and 50.6 μM, respectively). The
source of dissolved Fe cannot be determined with available data.
Shovelers Sink clay is a mix of minerals. And although illite–
smectite is the main Fe-bearing mineral controlling Fe biogeo-
chemistry in Shovelers Sink soil, the clay size fraction could contain
organics-bound or sorbed Fe, as well as small amounts of Fe(III)
hydroxide coatings. All of these Fe forms could contribute to
aqueous Fe.

After 10 days, an inoculum of each of

the three Fe(II)-
oxidizing isolates (Table 2) were added to replicate microbially
reduced clay suspensions. The Fe(II)-oxidizing inocula (1–5%
−
vol/vol) were grown heterotrophically on organics limited NO
3
reducing medium until the optical density of the culture at
600 nm stabilized, at which point all organic carbon had pre-
sumably been utilized. The inoculum volume was adjusted to
provide ca 106 cells/ml. The cultures reoxidized 60–65% (c.a.
1.2 mmol/l) of the Fe(II) generated by G. toluenoxidans strain sa2
−
(Figure 6A) while consuming 0.82–1.15 mM NO
3 (Figure 6B).

The incomplete reversibility of structural Fe redox cycle has been
observed before (Shen and Stucki, 1994) and a possible explana-
tion for this phenomenon is that the collapsing of smectite layers
as the result of Fe(III) reduction makes a portion of structural
Fe(II) inaccessible (Stucki, 2011).
−
No Fe(II) oxidation or NO
3 consumption took place in
absence of Fe(II)-oxidizing organisms. Although all of the Fe(II)-
oxidizing isolates are denitrifying bacteria, substantial amounts
−
of NO
2 (0.35–0.67 mM) were produced during Fe(II) oxidation
(Figure 6C). The Shovelers Sink soil used in the Fe cycling exper-
iment contained 1–2% associated organic carbon (see Figure 2).
−
The possibility therefore existed that NO
2 produced during
organotrophic oxidation of associated organic carbon could have
reacted chemically (abiotically) with Fe(II) in the reduced clay,
thereby contributing to the Fe(II) oxidation activity shown in
Figure 6A. We deemed this pathway unlikely given that each of the
isolated strains reduced nitrate directly to N2 with no signiﬁcant
−
NO
2 accumulation in organotrophic medium (data not shown).
Nevertheless, a separate experiment was conducted to evaluate
−
the extent to which reaction of Fe(II) with NO
2 may have been
responsible for the observed Fe(II) oxidation. Nitrite (2 mM) was
added to a suspension of microbially reduced Shovelers Sink clay,
−
and the concentrations of Fe(II) and NO
2 were followed over time
(Figure 7). The rate of chemical Fe(II) oxidation by nitrite (c.a.
0.018 mmol/l/day; Figure 7) was three to six times less than the
rate of oxidation in the microbial Fe cycling experiment (0.058–
0.118 mmol/l/day; Figure 6A). This result indicates that enzy-
matic activity was primarily responsible for nitrate-dependent

oxidation of reduced Shovelers Sink clay. Similar conclusions
were reached in a prior study of microbial nitrate-dependent
oxidation of other types of solid phase Fe(II) compounds in
−
which signiﬁcant accumulation of NO
2 took place (Weber et al.,
2001). Thus, although the organic matter associated with Shov-
elers Sink clay brings uncertainty into the exact stoichiometry of
Fe/N interactions, the results of this experiment clearly conﬁrm
that Fe in the native Shovelers Sink clay is readily available for
microbial redox transformation and can be cycled by the Fe(III)-
reducing and Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms recovered from
the soil.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PHYLLOSILICATE–Fe BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
Our studies conﬁrm the presence of both phyllosilicate–Fe(III)-
reducing and phyllosilicate–Fe(II)-oxidizing organisms in a redox-
imorphic soil, the biogeochemical conditions of which are consis-
tent with ongoing phyllosilicate–Fe redox cycling in the vicinity
of the water table and O2-releasing plant roots. Several solid
phase Fe redox cycling isolates were recovered from this soil using
model Fe(II) and Fe(III) containing phyllosilicates as the electron
donor or acceptor, including the Alphaproteobacterium Bradyrhi-
zobium sp, Betaproteobacteria C. necator and R. solanacearum,
and Deltaproteobacterium G. toluenoxydans. The recovery of a
Geobacter species as an agent of Fe(III) reduction at Shovelers
Sink is not surprising, as members of the Geobacteraceae often
dominate soil and sediment Fe(III)-reducing microbial popula-
tions (Lovley et al., 2004), and multiple species in this family
are known to reduce structural Fe(III) in phyllosilicates (Lovley
et al., 1998; Kostka et al., 1999; Kasheﬁ et al., 2008; Shelobolina
et al., 2008). Geobacter sp. dominated both, smectite and HFO
containing enrichment cultures and therefore was well adjusted
to using both Fe(III)-bearing phases as the electron acceptor.
Although a previous study (Kasheﬁ et al., 2008) suggested that
phyllosilicate–Fe(III)-reducing and Fe(III) (hydr)oxide-reducing
microbial populations may not always overlap, no speciﬁc agents
adjusted to using one or another solid phase Fe(III) were recovered
at Shovelers Sink.

The microorganisms

recovered as potential agents of
phyllosilicate–Fe(II) oxidation are all common rhizosphere bac-
teria. Bradyrhizobium spp. are well-known as N2 ﬁxing bacteria
that form a symbiotic relationship with plants, especially soybeans,
and are widely utilized in agriculture (Hume and Blair, 1992). In
contrast, R. solanacearum is a soil-born plant pathogen causing
leaf wilting in tomato, pepper, and potato plants as well as many
other plant species (Denny, 2005). C. necator (including former

Ralstonia eutropha strains) is a versatile soil bacterium known
as an aromatic and chloroaromatic compounds degrader and a
non-obligate bacterial predator of the bacteria and fungi (Makkar
and Casida, 1987; Lykidis et al., 2010).

Various strains of Bradyrhizobium spp. and C. necator (R.
eutropha) can grow autotrophically with H2 as the electron donor
(Bowien and Kusian, 2002; Schwartz et al., 2003; Franck et al.,
2008). In addition, a B. japonicum strain USDA110 is capable of
thiosulfate-based chemolithotrophy (Masuda et al., 2010). None
of phytopathogenic R. solanacearum strains were reported to
grow autotrophically (Palleroni and Doudoroff, 1971). However,
a recently recovered Ralstonia sp. strain HM08-01, 98% similar to
R. solanacearum, can oxidize soluble Fe(II) under microaerophilic
conditions (Swanner et al., 2011). Our studies suggest a new role
for these common rhizosphere bacteria, i.e., oxidation of struc-
tural Fe(II) in phyllosilicates. Further research with chemically
deﬁned substrates, such as FeCl2 and Fe(II)-NTA, is required to
determine exact stoichiometry of Fe(II) oxidation by Shovelers
Sink isolates.

The importance of native Fe(III) phyllosilicates as an electron
acceptor for organic matter oxidation coupled to dissimilatory
Fe(III) reduction in soils and sediments has been increasingly rec-
ognized (Kukkadapu et al., 2006; Stucki and Kostka, 2006; Komlos
et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2009). In contrast, the role of microbial
catalysis in phyllosilicate–Fe(II) oxidation has not received much
attention, and to date only one organism is known to carry-out
this reaction (Shelobolina et al., 2003). Our work thus signiﬁ-
cantly expands the range of organisms known to participate in
phyllosilicate–Fe(II) oxidation. The ability of common rhizos-
phere bacteria to carry-out this process has signiﬁcant implications
not only for phyllosilicate–Fe redox geochemistry, but also for
phyllosilicates diagenesis, e.g., low-temperature microbially dri-
ven smectite-to-illite transition, that may accompany Fe cycling in
smectite and affect plant nutrition (Shen and Stucki, 1994; Stucki,
2011).
