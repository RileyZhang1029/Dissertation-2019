ABSTRACT

in  situ  hybridization  analysis  showed 

Rho  small  GTPases  control  multiple  aspects  of  neuronal  morphogenesis  by 
regulating  the  assembly  and  organization  of  the  actin  cytoskeleton.  Although  they  are 
negatively  regulated  by  GTPase  activating  proteins  (GAPs),  the  roles  of  RhoGAPs  in 
the  nervous  system  have  not  been  fully  investigated.  Here  we  describe  a  charac-
terization  of  Drosophila  RhoGAP68F  that  is  mainly  expressed  in  the  embryonic  central 
nervous  system.  RNA 
that  expression  of 
RhoGAP68F  is  highly  restricted  to  the  embryonic  brain  and  ventral  nerve  cord.  Data-
base  search  revealed  that  RhoGAP68F  contains  an  N-terminal  Sec14  domain  and  a 
C-terminal  RhoGAP  domain.  Rho-GTP  pull-down  assay  demonstrated  that  the  RhoGAP 
domain  of  RhoGAP68F  inactivates  RhoA  but  not  Rac1  or  Cdc42  in  HEK293  cells.  In 
addition,  expression  of  RhoGAP68F  in  NIH3T3  cells  suppressed  LPA-induced  stress 
fiber 
is  mediated  by  RhoA.  Finally,  neuronal  overexpression  of 
RhoGAP68F  causes  synaptic  overgrowth  at  the  larval  neuromuscular  junction  (NMJ). 
Taken  together,  these  results  suggest  that  RhoGAP68F  may  play  a  role  in  synaptic

INTRODUCTION

    Rho  small  GTPases  including  RhoA,  Rac1,  and 
Cdc42  regulate  multiple  aspects  of  neuronal  develop-
ment  including  cell  migration,  cell  polarity,  axon 
growth  and  pathfinding,  and  dendritic  elaboration 
(Luo,  2000;  Govek  et  al.,  2005).  They  function  as 
molecular  switches  that  shift  between  an  active 
GTP-bound  state  and  an  inactive  GDP-bound  state 
(Jaffe  and  Hall,  2005).  The  active  forms  of  Rho

small  GTPases  bind  their  specific  effector  molecules 
to  regulate  F-actin  and  microtubule  dynamics  and 
gene  expression  (Jaffe  and  Hall,  2005).  While  gua-
nine  nucleotide  exchange  factors  (GEFs)  function 
as  positive  regulators  of  Rho  small  GTPases  by 
stimulating  the  exchange  of  bound  GDP  for  GTP, 
GTPase  activating  proteins 
(GAPs)  negatively 
regulate  Rho  small  GTPases  by  enhancing  the 
intrinsic  GTPase  activity  of  Rho  proteins  (Luo, 
2000;  Moon  and  Zheng,  2003;  Jaffe  and  Hall, 
2005). 
    As  suggested  by 
the  defined  roles  of  Rho 
GTPases  in  the  nervous  system,  various  Drosophila 
RhoGAP  proteins  have  been  implicated  in  neuronal 
morphogenesis.  For  example,  p190  RhoGAP  has 
been  shown  to  maintain  axon  branch  stability  in

CrossGAP/Vilse  mediates  Robo-mediated  axon

et  al.,  2004;  Hu  et  al.,  2005).  Recently,  the  Cdc42-

synaptic  growth  at

(NMJ)  (Nahm  et  al.,  2010),  further  demonstrating 
the  significance  of  RhoGAP  in  neuronal  develop-
ment. 
    Although  the  Drosophila  genome  contains  at  least 
20  predicted  RhoGAPs  (Hu  et  al.,  2005),  many  of 
them  have  not  been  characterized  in  the  nervous 
system.  In  this  study,  we  identified  RhoGAP68F  as 
a  RhoA-selective  GAP  that  is  highly  expressed  in 
the  embryonic  central  nervous  system  (CNS).  In 
addition,  we  show  that  overexpression  of  RhoGAP68F 
in  motor  neurons  causes  synaptic  overgrowth  at  the 
larval  NMJ.  These  results  raise  the  possibility  that 
RhoGAP68F  may  play  an  essential  role  for  neu-
ronal  development  by  inactivating  RhoA.

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

Cell  culture 

in 
    HEK293  and  NIH3T3  cells  were  cultured 
Dulbecco's  modified  Eagle's  medium 
(DMEM) 
containing  10%  fetal  bovine  serum  and  antibiotics. 
These  cells  were  transfected  using  Lipofectamine 
2000  (Invitrogen)  according  to  the  manufacturer's 
instructions.  To  induce  actin  structural  changes, 
NIH3T3  cells  were  serum-starved  for  12  hr  and 
treated  for  10  min  with  20  ng/ml  lysophosphatidic 
acid  (LPA)  (Sigma),  10  ng/ml  PDGF  (Upstate  Bio-
technology),  or  100  ng/ml  Bradykinin  (Sigma)  before 
fixation.

Plasmids

    The  full-length  cDNA  clone  for  RhoGAP68F  was 
obtained  from  the  Drosophila  Genomics  Resource 
Center.  The  entire  coding  region  of  RhoGAP68F 
was  amplified  by  PCR  using  appropriate  primers 
and 
for 
mammalian  expression.  The  RhoGAP68F-  R315A  point 
mutation  was  made  using  the  QuikChange  Multi  kit 
(Stratagene).  Plasmids  for  Myc-  RhoA,  Rac1,  and 
Cdc42  were  previously  described  (Nahm  et  al., 

into  pcDNA-HA 

introduced 

(Invitrogen) 

2006). 

RNA  in  situ  hybridization

    RNA  in  situ  hybridization  on  whole  mount  embryos 
was  performed  as  previously  described  (Tautz  and 
Pfeifle,  1989).  The  entire  RhoGAP68F  cDNA  was 
cloned  into  pBluscript  (Stratagene).  The  resulting 
plasmid  was  linearized  and  used  for  the  generation 
of  a  digoxygenin  (DIG)-UTP-labeled  RhoGAP68F 
RNA  probe  by  run-off  transcription.  Embryos  were 
dechorionated  and  fixed  in  PBS  containing  5% 
formaldehyde.  Fixed  embryos  were  hybridized  with 
DIG-labeled  riboprobes  at  62oC  and  then  incubated 
with  alkaline  phosphatase-conjugated  anti-DIG  anti-
body  for  1  hr  at  room  temperature.  The  alkaline 
phosphatase  reaction  was  performed  using  5-bromo- 
4-chloro-indoyl  phosphate  (BCIP)  and  nitro  blue 
tetrazolium  (NBT).  The  embryos  were  mounted  in 
Permount  (Fisher  Scientific).

Rho-GTP  pull-down  assay

    Inactivation  of  Rho  proteins  by  RhoGAP68F  was 
analyzed  using  the  EZ-detect  Rho,  Rac,  or  Cdc42 
activation  kit 
(Pierce),  as  previously  described 
(Nahm  et  al.,  2006).  Briefly,  HEK293  cells  transiently 
expressing  pCMV-Myc-RhoA,  Rac1,  or  Cdc42  and 
pcDNA-HA-RhoGAP68F  or  pcDNA-HA-RhoGAP68F- 
R315A  were  lysed  in  25  mM  Tris  (pH  7.5),  150  mM 
NaCl,  5  mM  MgCl2,  1%  NP-40,  1  mM  DTT,  and  5% 
glycerol.  Cell  lysates  were  clarified  by  centrifugation 
at  13,000×  g  for  10  min.  Equal  volumes  of  lysates 
were  then  incubated  at  4oC  for  1  hr  with  gluta-
thione-Sepharose  4B-bound  GST-Rhotekin-PBD  (for 
RhoA-GTP)  or  GST-PAK1-PBD  (for  Rac1-GTP  and 
Cdc42-GTP)  fusion  protein.  The  beads  were  washed 
four  times  with  the  lysis  buffer  and  boiled  in  SDS 
sample  buffer.  The  amount  of  GTP-bound  Myc-RhoA, 
Rac1,  or  Cdc42  was  determined  by  western  blotting 
using  an  anti-Myc  antibody  (Cell  Signaling).  The 
total  amounts  of  Rho  proteins  from  cell  lysates 
were  determined  by  western  blotting  using  an  anti- 
Myc  or  anti-HA  (Roche)  antibody.

Fly  stock  and  genetics

    The  wild-type  strain  used  in  this  study  was  w1118. 
A  transgenic  line  carrying  UAS-RhoGAP68F  was 
obtained  in  the  w1118  background  using  standard 
protocols  (Robertson  et  al.,  1988).  Elav-GeneSwitch-

GAL4  (Osterwalder  et  al.,  2001)  was  used  to  drive 
UAS-RhoGAP68F  expression  in  postembryonic  neu-
rons.

Immunohistochemistry

    NIH3T3  cells  were  transfected  with  a  plasmid 
encoding  HA-RhoGAP68F  or  HA-RhoGAP68F-R315A. 
Immunostaining  of  transfected  cells  was  performed 
as  previously  described  (Nahm  et  al.,  2006).  Fila-
mentous  actin  structures  were  visualized  using 
rhodamine-conjugated  phalloidin  (Invitrogen)  at  1：250.
    Larval  body  wall  muscles  were  dissected  from 
wandering 
-free  HL3 
saline  (Stewart  et  al.,  1994)  and  fixed  in  4%  for-
maldehyde  in  PBS  for  30  min.  Fixed  muscles  were 
washed  with  PBT  (PBS,  0.1%  Triton  X-100)  and 
incubated  with  goat  anti-HRP  conjugated  with  FITC 
(Jackson  ImmunoResearch,  1：200)  for  1  hr  at  room 
temperature.  Image  acquisition  and  morphological 
quantification  were  performed  as  previously  described 
(Nahm  et  al.,  2010).

RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION

Identification  of  RhoGAP68F,  a  RhoA-specific 
GAP  that  is  highly  expressed  in  the  nervous 
system   

    The  Drosophila  genome  contains  at  least  20 
RhoGAPs  for  the  Rho  family  (Hu  et  al.,  2005); 
however,  their  role(s)  in  the  developing  nervous 
system  are  still  poorly  understood.  As  an  initial  step 
to  address  this  issue,  we  searched  by  RNA  in  situ 
hybridization  on  whole-mount  embryos  for  previously 
uncharacterized  RhoGAP  genes  expressed  in  the 
central  nerves  system  (CNS),  and  found  that  the 
annotated  gene  RhoGAP68F  (CG6811)  fulfills  the 
criterion.  A  high  level  of  RhoGAP68F  message  was 
uniformly  detected  in  early  stage  embryos  (e.g. 
stage  5;  Fig.  1A),  suggesting  a  significant  maternal 
contribution  (Fig.  1A).  RhoGAP68F  expression  was 
restricted  to  brain  lobes  and  the  ventral  nerve  cord 
by  stage  13  (Fig.  1B).  The  enrichment  of  RhoGAP68F 
expression  in  the  embryonic  CNS  was  maintained 
until  the  end  of  embryogenesis  (Fig.  1C). 
    The  Flybase  database  predicts  that  RhoGAP68F 
encodes  a  476-amino  acid  protein  consisting  of  an 
N-terminal  Sec14  domain  (amino  acids  95-241)  and 
a  C-terminal  RhoGAP  domain  (amino  acids  289-

human  p50RhoGAP  protein  (Fig.  2A).  Overall,  the 
RhoGAP68F  protein  displays  37%  identity  and  60% 
similarity  to  its  human  counterpart  at  the  amino  acid 
level.  A  previous  work  has  shown  that  RhoGAP68F 
in  vitro 
has  GAP  activity 
(Sanny  et  al.,  2006).  To  examine 
in  vivo 
substrate  of  the  RhoGAP68F,  HEK293  cells  were 
transiently  transfected  with  pCMV-Myc-RhoA,  Rac1, 
or  Cdc42  along  with  either  pcDNA-HA  or  pcDNA- 
HA-RhoGAP68F,  and  the  amounts  of  active,  GTP- 
bound  Rho  GTPases  in  the  lysates  of  the  trans-
fectants  were  determined  by  p21-binding  domain 
(PBD)  pull-down  assays  (see  Materials  and  Methods). 
As  shown  in  Fig.  2B,  expression  of  HA-RhoGAP68F 
efficiently  removed  GTP-RhoA  (Fig.  2B).  However, 
the  level  of  GTP-Rac1  or  GTP-Cdc42  was  not 
changed  by  HA-RhoGAP68F  expression  (Fig.  2B), 
suggesting 
that  RhoGAP68F  acts  as  a  RhoA- 
selective  GAP  in  vivo.  RhoGAP68F  contains  the 
arginine  finger  at  position  315,  which  is  conserved 
in  RhoGAP-family  proteins.  A  RhoGAP68F  mutant 
carrying  a  substitution  mutation  of  this  amino  acid 
(RhoGAP68F-R315A)  did  not  effectively  reduce  the 
level  of  GTP-RhoA  (Fig.  2B).

encoding  HA,  HA-RhoGAP68F,  or  HA-RhoGAP68F- 
R315A.  Following  transfection,  GTP-loaded  RhoA, 
Rac1,  and  Cdc42  were  precipitated  with  GST  fusion 
PBDs  of  Rhotekin  (for  RhoA)  and  PAK1  (for  Rac1 
and  Cdc42).  The  levels  of  GTP-bound  GTPases  in 
the  precipitates  were  determined  by  western  blot 
analysis  using  an  anti-Myc  antibody  (upper  panel). 
Levels  of  HA  and  Myc  proteins  in  the  cell  lysates 
were  determined  by  western  blot  analysis  using 
anti-HA  (middle  panel)  and  anti-Myc  (lower  panel) 
antibodies,  respectively. 

specific  effects  on  the  organization  of  the  actin 
cytoskeleton  in  fibroblasts:  RhoA  produces  stress 
fibers  associated  with  focal  adhesion  complexes, 
Rac1  induces  lamellipodia  and  membrane  ruffles, 
and  Cdc42  triggers  the  formation  of  filopodia  or 
microspikes  (Hall,  1998).  To  further  characterize  the 
substrate  specificity  of  RhoGAP68F,  we  examined 
the  effect  of  RhoGAP68F  overexpression  on  the 
actin  cytoskeleton  in  cultured  cells.  NIH3T3  cells 
were  transfected  with  HA-tagged  RhoGAP68F  and 
then  stained  with  rhodamine-conjugated  phalloidin 
to  visualize  actin  filaments.  As  shown  in  Fig.  3, 
expression  of  RhoGAP68F  inhibited  lysophosphatidic 
acid  (LPA)-induced  stress  fiber  formation  mediated 
by  RhoA  (Fig.  3A).  However,  RhoGAP68F  expression 
had  no  effect  on  either  PDGF-induced  membrane 
ruffling  mediated  by  Rac1  or  Bradykinin-induced  filo-
podia  formation  mediated  by  Cdc42.  Finally,  LPA- 
induced  stress  fiber  formation  was  not  significantly 
affected  by  expression  of  the  R315A  GAP-deficient 
mutant

    Because  RhoGAP68F  was  found  highly  in  the 
embryonic  CNS,  we  wished  to  determine  the  role  of 
RhoGAP68F  in  synapse  development.  To  investigate 
this,  we  expressed  exogenous  RhoGAP68F  in  all

cells  were  transfected  with  a  plasmid  expressing  either  HA- 
RhoGAP68F  (A)  or  HA-RhoGAP68F-R315A  (B).  After  a  12  hr 
serum  withdrawal,  cells  were  incubated  with  20  ng/ml  LPA  for 
RhoA  activation,  10  ng/ml  PDGF  for  Rac1  activation,  or  100 
ng/ml  Bradykinin  for  Cdc42  activation.  Cells  were  stained  with 
anti-HA  and  rhodamine-conjugated  phalloidin  to  visualize  HA- 
RhoGAP68F  (green)  and  filamentous  actin  (red),  respectively.

compared  with  Elav-GS-GAL4/＋  controls  (169.4±5.3 
versus  120.0±2.1;  mean±SEM;  p<0.001).  In  addition, 
the  number  of  NMJ  branches  was  increased  by 
86% (29.7±0.8 versus 16.0±0.7;  p＜0.001), supporting 
a  novel  role  for  RhoGAP68F  in  the  regulation  of 
synaptic  growth.
    In  summary,  we  provide  evidence  that  RhoGAP68F 
functions  as  a  negative  regulator  of  RhoA  signaling 
in  vivo.  This  conclusion  is  consistent  with  a  pre-
vious  finding  that  RhoGAP68F  acts  as  a  RhoA- 
selective  GAP  in  vitro  (Sanny  et  al.,  2006).  Although 
RhoGAP68F  is  shown  to  regulate  morphogenetic 
events  during  gastrulation  of  the  embryo  (Sanny  et 
al.,  2006),  it  has  not  been  addressed  whether  they 
also  regulates  neuronal  morphogenesis. 
this 
study,  we  have  shown  that  RhoGAP68F  is  highly 
expressed  in  the  nervous  system  and  that  pre-
synaptic  overexpression  of  RhoGAP68F  affects  NMJ 
growth,  raising  the  possibility  that  RhoA  signaling 
and  its  regulators  may  play  a  key  role  in  synaptic 
growth  and  plasticity  during  development.
