Abstract
Despite many recent advances in the field of reproductive biology and medicine, the efficiency of
in vitro fertilization procedures remains relatively low. There is a need for a reliable and non-invasive
method of embryo selection to ensure that only embryos with the highest developmental potential
are chosen for transfer to mothers-to-be. Here, we compare various methods currently used for
assessing embryonic viability, such as examination of embryonic morphology, quality of the genetic
material, or metabolism. Additionally, we discuss novel procedures for embryonic assessment based
on advanced time-lapse imaging techniques, which show great promise and may lead to increased
in vitro fertilization efficiencies.

Introduction
Since 1978, when the first baby conceived in vitro was born,
in vitro fertilization (IVF) has become a major method for
treating infertility. Although IVF procedures have been
greatly improved over the years, their efficiency, as defined
by live birth rate, is still only about 30-40%. Consequently,
many couples have to undergo treatment several times
before they succeed and this increases emotional and
financial costs, as well as additional health risks for women.
The efficiency of IVF can be increased by transferring
multiple embryos in a single cycle, but this may lead to
multiple-pregnancies, and consequently serious health
complications for mothers and babies. There is, therefore,
a strong need for single embryo transfers, and so the
development of reliable methods of selecting embryos is
crucial [1,2]. Here, we provide a short review of current
techniques for embryo assessment, with a focus on new
ways of distinguishing high-quality embryos based on
recent advances in time-lapse imaging technology.

Static assessment of embryo morphology by
light microscopy
Visual assessment of embryo morphology is the most
traditional and popular method of embryo selection.
Several parameters can be assessed at different

developmental stages, providing valuable information
about the quality of embryos [3]. Embryos can be graded
according to the morphology of their pronuclei on day 1
after fertilization [4-6],
the number and shape of
blastomeres and degree of fragmentation on day 2 or 3
[7-9], or by the morphology of the blastocyst at day 5 or
6 [10-12]. Depending on the procedure, embryos are
evaluated at one or several developmental stages.

Although morphological assessment is inexpensive and
easy to implement in a clinical environment, it has its
drawbacks. Firstly, the visual grading of embryos is
subjective and requires significant expertise. Moreover,
even when such expertise is available, the technique is not
always accurate: low-graded embryos often prove to have
high developmental potential and can develop to term.
Therefore, there has been a drive to develop an alternative
method of embryo evaluation that provides more detailed
information about the developmental status of the embryo
and, most importantly, is quantitative and objective.

Preimplantation genetic diagnosis and screening
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis has been developed to
detect inherited genetic disorders. It uses polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-based techniques to diagnose specific

genetic mutations [13] or fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities or to sex
the embryos for patients carrying X-chromosome-linked
diseases [14-16]. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis can be
applied to embryos at different stages: zygotes (polar body
biopsy), cleavage stage embryos (blastomere biopsy) or
blastocysts (trophectoderm biopsy).

An alternative approach is preimplantation genetic screen-
ing, which was developed to improve IVF outcomes in
mothers of advanced age, those presenting with repeated
miscarriages or implantation failure, or in cases of severe
male factor infertility. The classic form of preimplantation
genetic screening, involving FISH assessment of a limited
number of chromosomes in one blastomere of a cleavage
stage embryo, has been shown to be ineffective and
has been gradually replaced by technologies based on
comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) or single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays [17,18]. Both of
these approaches allow the whole embryonic genome to
be analysed and, as for preimplantation genetic diagnosis,
used at different embryonic stages.

Metabolomics and proteomics in screening
Another method of embryo selection is based on the
analysis of embryo metabolism. Changes in pyruvate or
glucose concentration in the culture medium can reflect
the energy metabolism of the embryo, although their
usefulness as a tool to predict the embryo’s quality is not
clear [19-23]. On the other hand, oxygen consumption
[24-27] and amino-acid turnover [28-30] have proved to
be more reliable indicators of an embryo’s viability.
Recently, the analysis of single metabolites has been
gradually replaced by a broader approach: metabolomic

or protein secrotome profiling [31], which can provide a
complete picture of an embryo’s metabolism and gene
expression patterns. Although many reports have shown
a correlation between metabolic status of the embryo
and its viability, establishing its potential value for the
IVF clinics, for the moment these techniques remain
difficult to implement in a clinical environment. This is
because metabolomic or secreted protein analyses involve
spectroscopic/spectrometric and chromatographic techni-
ques, which currently require expensive equipment and
highly skilled staff [31].

Dynamic assessment of embryonic development
by time-lapse imaging
Due to recent advances in non-invasive time-lapse imaging
established in mouse embryos [32], we can now follow the
dynamics of embryo divisions and other fertilization-
triggered events and correlate them with the develop-
mental potential of the embryos. The last two years have
seen two studies employing this technique in a very
different way. A team at Stanford University has shown that
the timing and synchrony of the first two embryonic
divisions are predictive of developmental potential of
human embryos (Figure 1) [33]. The authors reported that
embryos with a very long first cytokinesis, with a prolonged
or an atypically short interval between first and second
division or with highly asynchronous divisions of two-cell
blastomeres, fail to reach the blastocyst stage. This accords
with previous observations, in which timely pronuclear
formation and subsequent first cleavage correlated with
higher quality of human embryos [34-36]. A completely
different approach has been developed by our team at
University of Cambridge working collaboratively with
teams at Oxford and Cardiff Universities (Figure 2) [37].

(1 frame every 10s)

The method described by Wong et al. involves time-lapse imaging of embryos every 5 min for several hours (from 1- to 4-cell stage) [33]. In comparison, the method
established by Ajduk et al. requires a much shorter period of recording (2.5 hours for mouse embryos) but with images taken every 10 seconds [37].

Mouse eggs are subjected to time-lapse imaging (1 frame every 10 seconds for 2.5 hours) immediately after fertilization [37]. Acquired images are analysed
by the particle image velocimetry method that follows patterns of contrasts between subsequent images and calculates how they move. The sum of all
displacement vectors calculated for the zygote in a given time-point (i.e. mean cytoplasmic speed) is plotted over time. The graph shows when fast cytoplasmic
movements occurred in the embryo. Mean interval between the fast movements (in red) and mean speed in periods inbetween the fast movements
(mean basal speed, in blue) are indicative of developmental potential of the embryo.

In this work, we showed that fertilization of mouse eggs
triggers abrupt, repetitive cytoplasmic movements that
correlated with Ca2+ oscillations (also triggered by sperm)
and depended on the functionality of the cytoskeleton.
Moreover, the cytoplasmic flows were predictive of the
developmental potential of the embryos. Embryos that
showed very frequent increases in cytoplasmic movements
(indicating very frequent Ca2+ oscillations) and low

cytoplasmic speeds in the intervening periods (reflecting
low quality of the actin cytoskeleton) were three-fold less
successful in developing to pups than embryos displaying
average values of
these parameters. Although both
methods still have to be tested in a clinical environment
and subjected to randomised controlled trials to demon-
strate improved live birth outcomes, they offer great hope
for more reliable assessment of embryonic quality.

Conclusion
Research carried out over the past three decades has
provided a broad repertoire of possible improved embryo
selection methods. Some of them, such as evaluation
of pronuclear morphology, preimplantation genetic diag-
nosis and preimplantation genetic screening, focus on
the nuclear component of
looking for
potential chromosomal abnormalities. Others (e.g. analy-
sis of metabolites, secreted proteins or cytoplasmic flows)
concentrate on the cytoplasmic component, analysing the
quality of embryo metabolism, the cytoskeleton or Ca2+
homeostasis. We believe that
the ultimate selection
method should combine these approaches. This can be
achieved for instance by following the timing of embryo-
nic cell divisions, as their duration and synchrony can be
affected by improper chromosome segregation, cytoskele-
tal properties and energy levels. An alternative approach
could combine preimplantation genetic screening with the
analysis of embryo metabolism or cytoplasmic move-
ments. Combination of genetic testing of the polar body
and examination of the cytoplasmic flows is especially
promising, as it would provide information about embryo
quality within several hours after fertilization, and, there-
fore, significantly quicken the selection process (Figure 1).
Indeed, recent publications suggest that a shorter period
between in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer may be
beneficial, as prolonged in vitro culture of embryos alters
their epigenetic modifications and gene expression
[38,39]. Through a combination of these new methods,
it is reasonable to expect that embryo selection for IVF will
become much more reliable in the coming years.
