The effects of nonglycated bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
advanced glycosylation end products of BSA (AGE-BSA) on
vascular responses of control and metabolic syndrome (MS)
rats characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension,
hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance were studied. Albu-
min and in vitro prepared AGE-BSA have vascular effects;
however, recent studies indicate that some effects of in vitro
prepared AGEs are due to the conditions in which they were
generated. We produced AGEs by incubating glucose with
BSA for 60 days under sterile conditions in darkness and at
37◦C. To develop MS rats, male Wistar animals were given
30% sucrose in drinking water since weanling. Six month
old animals were used. Blood pressure, insulin, triglycerides,
and serum albumin were increased in MS rats. Contraction
of aortic rings elicited with norepinephrine was stronger.
There were no effects of nonglycated BSA or AGE-BSA on
contractions in control or MS rats; however, both groups re-
sponded to L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis.
Arterial relaxation induced using acetylcholine was smaller
in MS rats. Nonglycated BSA and AGE-BSA signiﬁcantly
diminished relaxation in a 35% in the control group but
the decrease was similar when using nonglycated BSA and
AGE-BSA. This decrease was not present in the MS rats
and was not due to increased RAGEs or altered biochemical
characteristics of BSA. In conclusion, both BSA and AGE-
BSA inhibit vascular relaxation in control artic rings. In MS
rats the effect is lost possibly due to alterations in endothelial
cells that are a consequence of the illness.

as glycation or Maillard reaction. This reaction occurs in several
steps, the initial ones being relatively fast and reversible, while
the latter ones are slower and irreversible originating products
known as advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs). AGEs
were originally characterized by their yellow-brown ﬂuorescent
color and by their ability to cross-link with and between amino
groups (Reynolds 1963). However, the term is now used for
a broad range of advanced products of the Maillard reaction,
including N-carboxymethyllysine (CML) and pyrroline (Reddy
et al. 1995; Baynes and Thorpe 1999).

AGEs exert their actions by two different mechanisms: (1)
modifying structural intra- and extracellular proteins and (2)
binding to their receptors (RAGEs) that belong to the im-
munoglobulin family and are located in the plasma membranes
of monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and vascular
smooth muscle cells (Brownlee 1995; Basta et al. 2002). When
AGEs bind to their receptors they initiate second messenger cas-
cades. They also generate reactive oxygen species which mod-
ulate cellular function and can induce inﬂammatory processes
(Krieglstein and Granger 2001; Basta et al. 2002; Ramasamy
et al. 2005).

Albumin is one of the main proteins undergoing glycation
reactions due to its abundance in serum and to the fact that it can
be glycated at multiple sites (Wautier and Guillausseau 1998).
Both bovine serum albumin (BSA) and AGE-BSA have been
reported to have vascular effects. BSA reacts with nitric oxide
(NO) therefore modulating its biological actions and increasing
endothelial permeability (Predescu et al. 2002). Some forms of
AGEs also diminish vascular relaxation by decreasing the NO
production of endothelial cells (Hogan et al. 1992; Xu et al.
2003). Nevertheless, there have been recent reports that other
forms of in vitro prepared AGEs have different effects from the
naturally produced AGEs (Valencia et al. 2004).

AGEs have been implicated in aging processes and in the
development of chronic complications of diabetes such as re-
nal and vascular damage and could also participate in compli-
cations of metabolic syndrome (Brownlee 1995; Wautier and
Guillausseau 1998; Valencia et al. 2004). There is a signiﬁcant
association between a high incidence of cardiovascular events
and endothelial damage in animal models and diabetic patients
and one of the mechanisms underlying this association is the
presence of AGEs in plasma (Tan et al. 2002).

A variant of fructose-induced hypertension by giving sucrose
to rats has been developed in our institution. The fructose-fed rat
becomes hypertensive, hypertriglyceridemic, hyperinsulinemic
and has insulin resistance; it exhibits what is known as metabolic
syndrome (MS) or “Syndrome X” (Hwang et al. 1987). Some of
the characteristics of the model developed in our institution have
already been described (Ba˜nos et al. 1997) and they coincide
with those of fructose fed animals, i.e., our rats also develop hy-
pertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin

resistance. They also show increased oxidative stress (Ba˜nos
et al. 2005). Some of the characteristics of these animals are
accentuated by age and have been associated with renal fail-
ure and cardiovascular diseases which are related to alterations
in the structure and function of endothelial cells (Rubio et al.
2006). AGEs could play a role in the vascular damage found in
MS rats. Therefore, the aim of the present paper was to deter-
mine the effect of nonglycated BSA and AGE-BSA on aortic
rings from control and MS rats.

Results

Changes in body weight, arterial pressure, triglycerides,
glucose, insulin, and serum albumin
Table I shows the values of body weight, arterial pressure, glu-
cose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), triglyc-
erides, and serum albumin for control and MS rats. Experimental
animals developed metabolic syndrome characterized by arte-
rial hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, and
insulin resistance. There was a statistically signiﬁcant increase
in the serum albumin values in MS rats. Although there was no
signiﬁcant change in body weight, the animals with MS clearly
developed central adiposity.

AGE-BSA preparation
It was possible to produce AGE-BSA under the previously de-
scribed condition. After incubation with glucose, the albumin
solution took a yellow-brown color and showed the characteris-
tic ﬂuorescence spectrum of AGEs. Albumin incubated with-
out glucose did not signiﬁcantly change its appearance and
did not have the characteristic ﬂuorescence spectrum of AGEs
(Figure 1).

The puriﬁcation of AGE-BSA on Afﬁ-Gel-Blue is shown in
Figure 2; three peaks were observed which corresponded to the
highly glycated BSA (ﬁrst one), the less glycated BSA moder-
ately, and stronger bound to the chromatographic matrix (second
and third peaks, respectively). The ﬁrst peak was employed for
subsequent analysis and tested for vasoreactivity.

The AGE-BSA produced had a protein concentration of
53.8 mg/mL and a speciﬁc activity, before its puriﬁcation in
Afﬁ-Gel Blue, of 7.9 AU/mg of protein and of 10.5 AU/mg of
protein, after puriﬁcation. Fluorescence was not signiﬁcantly
elevated when protein concentration of nonglycated BSA was
increased (Figure 3). The value of speciﬁc activity was simi-
lar to that obtained by other authors using similar procedures
(Verbeke et al. 1997).

The ﬁrst peak was the only one to be further analyzed. The arrows indicate the
buffer used at each stage.

Changes in mass and isoelectric point of BSA and glycated
BSA
Table II shows the results of the analysis of the main glycation
sites of the BSA structure. The analysis was done using the se-
quence of bovine serum albumin reported in the GenBank with
number CAA76847 (gi:3336842) and the PyMOL v0.99 pro-
gram (DeLano Scientiﬁc LLC, CA). The disposition of the ly-
sine and arginine residues in the three-dimensional structure was
evaluated. The analysis shows that a maximum of 52 residues
from the 79 present in the molecule can be glycated. The rest of
the residues are in the inside of the structure of BSA.

Figure 4 shows a molecular mass of 66,655.58 Da for nong-
lycated BSA (Figure 4A). After glycation, the molecular mass
increased to 74,461.15 Da (Figure 4B). The net increase of
7,805.57 Da observed corresponds to the addition of 48 glucose
molecules, considering that the molecular mass of glucose is
180.2 Da and that during each reaction of Amadori product,
a water molecule is liberated (18 Da). The amount of glucose

as pre-incubated control BSA and AGE-BSA at a concentration
of 3.8 mg/mL (data not shown).

In MS aortic rings vasorelaxation was not signiﬁcantly af-

fected by BSA or AGE-BSA at any of the doses tested.

Immunoﬂuorescence of RAGEs
Results of expression of RAGE are shown in Figure 7. There
is an increased RAGE immunoreactivity in aortas from MS rats
when compared to control rats. In aortas from C rats ﬂuores-
cence is observed mainly in the endothelium while in MS aortas
both the endothelium and muscular ﬁbers ﬂuoresce. Damage
due to the development of the metabolic syndrome can also be
appreciated by the presence of buckles and a loss of continuity
in elastic ﬁbers.

Discussion

The aim of the present paper was to determine the effect of
nonglycated BSA and AGE-BSA on vascular aortas from con-
trol and MS rats in which the condition is induced by a high
ingestion of sucrose and where the structure and function of
endothelial cells are altered. Both albumin and AGEs have been
reported to have vascular effects (Vlassara et al. 1992). How-
ever, the vascular effects of AGEs might not be produced by
all types of AGEs, since AGEs may have very different struc-
tures depending on the reactions generated during the in vitro
glycation process of the protein by reducing sugars (Katchalsky
and Sharon 1953). Some of the AGEs generated are capable of
cross-linking to proteins and others have the capacity to interact
with speciﬁc receptors (RAGEs) present in some cellular types
(Valencia et al. 2004).

There have also been recent reports that some of the effects
of in vitro prepared AGEs are due to metal ions which are
contaminants commonly found in AGE preparations. Various
metal ions have been shown to drive inﬂammatory responses
via generation of oxidative stress (Valencia et al. 2004). The
use of a chelator such as EDTA to facilitate the reaction could
induce some of the effects reported to be produced by AGEs
(Al-Abed et al. 1999).

Our results show that body weight was not signiﬁcantly mod-
iﬁed in MS rats even if the diet of the sucrose-fed rats was hyper-
caloric (Ba˜nos et al. 1997) (Table I). However, sucrose-fed ani-
mals showed increased central adiposity. Insulin was increased
in MS rats and this increase accompanies an increase in blood
pressure. Triglycerides were also elevated. Therefore the MS
rats show many of the characteristics of metabolic syndrome.

speciﬁc activity obtained by the puriﬁcation process on Afﬁ-Gel-Blue is
observed. Bold circles represent the nonglycated BSA. Bold squares represent
the unpuriﬁed AGE-BSA and bold triangles represent the puriﬁed AGE-BSA.
Speciﬁc activity increased in approximately 33% by the puriﬁcation process.

bound to BSA in our preparation was 48, very close to the 52 the-
oretically possible; therefore, we consider that our AGE-BSA is
a highly glycated product.

Nonglycated BSA had an isoelectric point of 4.2. The gly-
cation process changed the isoelectric point to 6.3 (Figure 4,
inset).

Vascular responses
Norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction was higher in MS rats
than in control rats (Table III); nevertheless, vasoconstriction
was not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed in aortic rings from control or
MS rats in the presence of nonglycated BSA or AGE-BSA.
L-NAME signiﬁcantly increased vascular contraction in both
groups (154.41 ± 10.35% versus 186.18 ± 7.58%, respectively)
since inhibition of NOS induces an imbalance in vasoconstric-
tion and vasodilation which is greater in MS than in control rats
(Figure 5).

Basal relaxation was diminished in MS rats when compared to
control rats (Table III). Figure 6 shows the effect of nonglycated
BSA and AGE-BSA upon vascular relaxation in aortic rings
from control and MS rats. In control rings nonglycated BSA
and AGE-BSA at 40 AU/mL (3.8 mg/mL) signiﬁcantly inhib-
ited the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in a 35%. This
effect was not present when a lower dose was used (10 AU/mL;
0.95 mg/mL). Fresh albumin, fatty acid free, diminished vasore-

Serum albumin concentration was signiﬁcantly higher in MS
rats when compared to control rats. However, Rumble et al.
(1997) reported that diabetic and hypertensive rats had lower
serum albumin levels than the normotensive Sprague Dawley
rats.

Vascular contraction to norepinephrine increased MS rats in
this study. This has been previously described for this model
(Ba˜nos et al. 1997) and additionally we have previously found
that contraction to KCl in MS rats is also increased and that
this is due to an elevated response to endothelin (Nava et al.
1999; Rubio et al. 2006). The increase in the circulating levels
of albumin in the MS group may contribute to the increased
vascular tone observed in this group. Indeed, an increase in
circulating albumin levels has been observed in some forms of
hypertensive pathology, due to the hemoconcentration induced
by edema, which positively correlates with the hypertension
levels (Allen and Patterson 1995). AGEs could also participate

520

in the increase in vascular contraction in MS rats since they
increase the production of endothelin-1 by endothelial cells (Tan
et al. 2002). Our results show that vasoconstriction was not
modiﬁed by nonglycated BSA or by AGE-BSA (Figure 5). This
is in accordance with the results of Xu et al. (2003).

Vasorelaxation in MS rats was signiﬁcantly diminished in
comparison to control rats and could be attributed to an im-
balance of constricting and relaxing factors as has been pre-
viously reported (Ba˜nos et al. 1997). Furthermore, as our
model of MS rats is caused by the chronic ingestion of su-
crose, vascular damage could be a probable consequence of
AGEs increased production. AGEs deposit inside smooth mus-
cle and endothelial cells as well as in extracellular matrix pro-
teins increasing rigidity. Hogan et al. (1992) have reported
that AGEs react with NO produced by endothelial cells. They
also reported that AGEs reduce the antiproliferative effect of
NO on aortic smooth muscle vascular and renal mesangial
cells.

Insulin, which is also increased in our model, stimulates col-
lagen synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (Ruiz Torres
et al. 1998) and could contribute to diminished vasorelaxation
in MS rats. Arterial endothelium-dependent relaxation is also
diminished hypertensive rats (Ibarra et al. 1995; K¨ung and
L¨uscher 1995; Challah et al. 1997; Freitas et al. 2003; Shipley
and Muller-Delp 2005). These authors have proposed that the
reduced response to Ach could be a consequence of an impair-
ment of either the generation (synthesis or release) of relaxant
factors or the cellular response to them.

BSA and AGE-BSA on vascular relaxation in metabolic syndrome

In our study, both nonglycated BSA and AGE-BSA decreased
vasorelaxation in the same proportion in control rats. In arte-
rial rings incubated in the presence of glycated and nongly-
cated BSA the response to acetylcholine was 35% reduced in
comparison to control rings incubated in the absence of BSA
(Figure 6A). The reduction in vascular relaxation in the pres-
ence of nonglycated BSA is in accordance with the report by
Predescu et al. (2002). These authors suggested that BSA reacts
with NO therefore modulating its biological actions and in-
creasing endothelial permeability. Although in our experiments
we also found a decrease by AGE-BSA, it seems to be due to
BSA since there was not a signiﬁcant difference in the reduction
produced by AGE-BSA and by nonglycated BSA.

Previously, Xu et al. (2003) studied the vascular effects of
AGEs produced in vitro testing vasoreactivity in rings of tho-
racic aorta from New Zealand white rabbits and in vitro pro-
duction of NO in endothelial cells from human umbilical veins.
These authors reported that there was not a signiﬁcant effect of
AGEs upon vasoconstriction induced by NE and our results are
in accordance with this result. However, they found that AGEs
diminished the NO production of isolated endothelial cells and
that vasodilation was reduced in thoracic aortic rings while we
found that AGEs did not modify vasodilation. Our data suggest
that it is BSA that exerts the diminished vasorelaxing effect and
not AGEs. In their study the authors produced AGEs incubat-
ing BSA with glucose 6-phosphate instead of glucose which
is a faster reaction. Glucose 6-phosphate is a reducing sugar
of great intracellular importance and can glycate easier than
glucose since it is present in a higher proportion in the open-
chain form (Hogan et al. 1992). Their reaction was facilitated
by the use of EDTA which could induce the effect reported by
them (Al-Abed et al. 1999). AGEs derived from a long period
of incubation of BSA with glucose, as was done in this paper,
conduces mainly to ﬂuorescent cross-linking AGE production.
Using speciﬁc antibodies, these authors found high levels of
carboximetillysine (CML) in their preparation and identiﬁed
CML as the AGE responsible of the NO synthesis inhibition.
Therefore, the kind of AGEs used by them could explain the
contradiction between their results and what we observed in the
present paper. Furthermore, the difference of the species used
for testing vasodilation in both papers (New Zealand rabbits and
Wistar rats) might account for the contradicting results found.
The same authors (Xu et al. 2003) did not ﬁnd the expected
previously reported decrease in vascular relaxation when they
added nonglycated BSA. The absence of a vascular effect of
nonglycated BSA in the above-mentioned study is probably due
to the very low doses assayed, in the order of µg/mL. It is known

that albumin has a physiologic effect at higher concentration.
Indeed, our own results show that the inhibitory effect of BSA
or AGE-BSA was only observed when the protein concentration
assayed was about of 3.81 mg/mL, but not when it was only of
0.95 mg/mL.

The response to nonglycated BSA and AGEs disappeared in
the MS rats (Figure 6B). Alterations in the structure and func-
tion of the vascular structures caused by the metabolic syndrome
could be the underlying cause of the lack of response in these
animals. This physiological adaptation could be considered as a
protector effect to counteract the increased basal vasoconstric-
tion observed in metabolic syndrome rats, and must be better
studied. We evaluated the presence of AGEs’ receptors (RAGEs)
from aortas in MS rats to better explore the mechanism by which
AGEs participate in this pathology. Many of the deleterious ef-
fects of AGEs are mediated by binding to their receptors which
are present in various cellular types. In endothelial cells, the
interaction AGE–RAGE modulates the expression of citocynes
and adhesion molecules and increases the production of oxygen
reactive species (ROS) generating oxidative stress (Ramasamy
et al. 2005). Koyama et al. (2005) demonstrated that an alterna-
tive form of RAGE, the endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE),
is associated with the metabolic syndrome or atherosclerosis in
the absence of diabetes. Inﬂammation might be the factor link-
ing the RAGE system with MS. Although a higher number of
RAGEs were observed in the aortas from MS rats, AGE-BSA
did not have any effect on arterial relaxation in this group. More-
over, the absence of differences in arterial relaxation induced by
AGE-BSA or BSA in the control group suggests that the possi-
ble effect of AGE-BSA on vascular function in not mediated by
RAGEs.

The exposition of the vascular tissue to AGE-BSA during the
development of MS could also cause the loss of the relaxation
capacity of aortas. The changes in the charge and composi-
tion of the BSA molecule produced by glycation increase its
aggregation capacity. When the isoelectric point is closer to
physiological pH, hydrophobic interactions are favored. These
changes could increase the cross-linking activity of AGEs to
proteins and the capacity to deposit in the extracellular matrix
of the tissues. Correspondingly, we observed an increased ag-
gregation capacity of AGE-BSA during alcohol precipitation
or desalting. However, the loss of the relaxing capacity due to
biochemical changes of AGE-BSA is not favored by our results
since there were no differences in the relaxation in the presence
of BSA or AGE-BSA.

We speculate that the cause could be the altered albumin inter-
nalization to endothelial cells and therefore a modiﬁed neutral-
ization of NO. This should be further evaluated. The molecular
structure and charge of albumin facilitate the cotransport of
a number of hydrophobic molecules, enzymes, and hormones
across the endothelium and the maintenance of vascular integrity
and transvascular oncotic pressure gradient (Metha and Malik
2006). Endothelial permeability to plasma proteins and liquid is
increased in inﬂammation, a condition manifested by protein-
rich edema (Metha and Malik 2006). Inﬂammation is present in
metabolic syndrome and therefore alterations in albumin trans-
port across endothelial cells are likely to be present. Bevers
et al. (2006) reported that in bEnd.3 endothelial cells, which
only produce eNOS and have higher levels of NO than other
endothelial cells, incubation with low albumin levels increased
eNOs activity and the production of NO.

522

In conclusion both BSA and AGE-BSA inhibit vascular re-
laxation mediated by NO in control artic rings in the same
proportion. This inhibitory effect is likely to be due to the struc-
ture of BSA and not to the ﬂuorescent AGEs synthesized by
the employed procedure. However, in MS rats this inhibitory
vascular relaxation effect is lost, possibly due to alterations in
endothelial cells that are a consequence of the illness.

Materials and methods

Animals and arterial pressure determination
Experiments in animals were approved by the Laboratory An-
imal Care Committee of our institution and were conducted in
compliance with our institution’s ethical guidelines for animal
research.
Weanling male Wistar rats aged 25 days and weighing 50 ±
4 g were separated into two groups—group 1: control rats (C)
were given tap water for drinking and group 2: MS rats were
given 30% sucrose in drinking water during a 24-week period.
All animals were fed Purina 5001 rat chow (Purina Mills Inc.,
Richmond, IN) ad libitum, which provides 14.63 kJ/g, with 23%
protein, 12% fat, and 65% carbohydrate. Animals were kept at
controlled temperature and a 12:12-h light-dark cycle.

Systolic arterial blood pressure was measured in conscious
animals using the tail cuff method; the cuff was connected to
a pneumatic pulse transducer (Narco Bio-Systems Inc., Health-
dyne Co., Austin, TX) and a programmed electrosphyngo-
manometer. The mean of ﬁve independent determinations was
calculated.

AGE-BSA preparation
AGE-BSA were prepared, puriﬁed, and characterized in the re-
productive biology laboratory of Instituto Nacional de Ciencias
M´edicas y Nutrici´on “Salvador Zubir´an” following the tech-
nique previously described (Makita et al. 1991, 1992).

AGE-BSA was prepared by incubating 5% of bovine serum
albumin (BSA fraction V; Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) in
200 mM of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 500 mM
glucose for 60 days under sterile conditions, in darkness and at
◦
37
C. After incubation, the product was reduced with 100 mM
sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma Chemical) for 30 min at
room temperature to stabilize the Schiff bases formed (Eble et al.
1983; Fluckiger and Gallop 1984; Verbeke et al. 1997). Then,
the unbound glucose and unreacted NaBH4 were removed by
extensive dialysis against a 500 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4). Less glycosylated BSA was removed from AGE-BSA
by afﬁnity chromatography on Afﬁ-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad Labora-
tories, Richmond, CA) (Travis et al. 1976; Verbeke et al. 1997).
The Afﬁ-Gel matrix has a blue dye named Cibacron Blue F3GA,
with natural afﬁnity for native albumin. A column with 5 mL
of matrix with a binding capacity of 170 mg of BSA was em-
ployed. 2 mL of AGE-BSA solution with a concentration of
53.8 mg/mL was applied in each puriﬁcation process, using a
ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min. The chromatogram was performed eval-
uating a dilution 1/10 of each tube.

Protein concentration of AGE-BSA was evaluated by the
Lowry method using BSA as standard (Lowry et al. 1951).
Finally, AGE-speciﬁc ﬂuorescence determination was per-
formed by measuring emission at 440 nm upon excita-
tion at 370 nm using an Aminco ﬂuorescence spectrometer

(Aminco-Bowman Series 2 SLM Instruments. Inc., Rochester,
NY) (Monnier and Cerami 1981; Makita et al. 1992). Fluo-
rescence value of AGE-BSA was measured at a protein con-
centration of 1 mg/mL and expressed in arbitrary units (AU).
The speciﬁc activity (SA) was expressed as arbitrary units of
ﬂuorescence per mg of protein (AU/mg).

The control BSA sample (nonglycated BSA) was incubated
under identical conditions but without glucose. AGE-BSA and
its control (nonglycated BSA) were maintained at −70
◦
C until
used.

Mass increase analysis of glycated BSA
The mass change of BSA after glycation was analyzed by
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF) (Voyager DE-PRO from Applied Biosystems,
CA), equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm), operating in a
positive high-energy linear mode. This analysis was made in the
Analysis and Molecular Diagnose Unit of the Insituto Nacional
de Salud P´ublica de M´exico.

Aliquots of 500 µL containing 10 mg/mL of BSA or AGE-
BSA were diluted to 1.5 mL with deionized water and cen-
trifuged in Amicon Ultracel-10 K (Millipore Corporation, MA)
at 2,000× g for 30 min to a ﬁnal volume of 500 µL. Washing was
repeated three times. A 10 µL aliquot was taken for MALDI-
TOF analysis. The matrix solution employed for BSA analysis
contained 10 mg/mL 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid
(sinapinic acid) in 30% vol/vol acetonitrile in 0.1% vol/vol
aqueous triﬂuoroacetic acid. For AGE-BSA the matrix solu-
tion contained 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (gentisic acid, which
is employed for analysis of glycoproteins) to 10 mg/mL in 50%
vol/vol acetonitrile. A sample protein solution (1 µL) of a 1:1
vol/vol mixture of 1 mg/mL of total protein and the matrix so-
lution were applied on a sample spot in a steel plate slide and
dried in a warm air stream. Bovine’s insulin (5,734.59 Da), E.
coli’s Thioredoxin (11,674.48 Da), and horse’s Apomyoglobyn
(16,952.56 Da) were used as standard for calibration.

Isoelectric point of glycated BSA
The change in the isoelectric point of BSA after glycation was
analyzed by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels using
a FastSystem (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The bands were
dyed with silver nitrate, and the isoelectric point was evalu-
ated using the analytical unit of FastSystem employing a broad
range standard kit (pH 3–10) (Amersham Biosciences, Buck-
inghamshire, United Kingdom) as a protein calibrator.

Blood sample collection and determination of glucose, insulin,
triglycerides, and serum albumin
After overnight fasting (12 h), the animals were killed by de-
capitation and blood was collected. It was spun and the serum
was separated by centrifugation at 600 × g during 15 min at
room temperature and stored at −70
◦
C until needed. Serum in-
sulin was determined using a commercial radioimmunoassay
(RIA) speciﬁc for rat (Linco Research, Inc., Missouri); its sen-
sitivity was 0.1 ng/mL and intra- and interassay coefﬁcients
of variation were 5 and 10%, respectively. Glucose concentra-
tion was assayed using an enzymatic SERA-PAKR Plus from
Bayer Corporation (S´ees, France). Homeostasis model assess-
ment (HOMA) was used as an index to measure the degree of
insulin resistance and was calculated by the formula [insulin

(µU/mL) × glucose (mmol/L)/22.5] (Matthews et al. 1985;
Pickavance et al. 1999; Nandhini et al. 2005). Triglycerides
(TGs) were determined by commercially available procedures
(Randox, Laboratories LTD, Antrim, United Kingdom). Serum
albumin was evaluated in both groups of animals using a kit
commercialized by Hycel of Mexico which uses bromocresol
green (IL-test Instrumentation Laboratory Company, Lexington,
MA). Samples were read using an Ilab-600 automatic system.

Sample preparation and tension recording
The animals were killed by decapitation, and aortas were im-
mediately dissected and placed in an oxygenated normal Tyrode
solution (mM: 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes,
and 5.5 glucose) pH 7.4. Arteries were carefully cleaned from
connective and adipose tissue, taking care not to damage the
endothelium. Tension measurements were made as previously
described (Nava et al. 1999). Brieﬂy, segments of about 2 to
3 mm long were cut and two 250-µm-diameter S-shaped sil-
ver wires (Medwire Corp, Mount Vernon, NY) were inserted
into the lumen to measure tension developed transversely by
rings of the vessel. One of the silver wires was ﬁxed to the
bottom of an in vitro chamber, and the other was attached to
a tension transducer that was connected to a Grass polygraph
model 79D. The chamber was ﬁlled with a Tyrode solution, and
termorregulated and bubbled with carbogen (95% oxygen, 5%
carbon dioxide). A basal passive tension of 2 g was applied
after determination in preliminary tests that this was the opti-
mal resting tension under our experimental conditions. Arteries
were allowed to rest for 1 h and the solution was changed ev-
ery 20 min. Contraction was induced twice by the addition of
norepinephrine (NE) (1 µM). Arteries were washed by adding
a fresh Tyrode solution to the chamber allowing the rings to
return to their basal tension (2 g). The mean contraction value
was considered as 100% of response. The vasodilator activ-
ity was studied by cumulative concentration–response curves
−4 M) on precontracted aor-
to acetylcholine (Ach) (10
tic rings in the following experimental groups: (A) incubated
only with the Tyrode solution, (B) incubated during 40 min
with AGE-BSA at 10 AU/mL, (C) incubated with AGE-BSA at
40 AU/mL, (D) incubated with nonglycated BSA at a pro-
tein concentration equivalent to 10 UA/mL of AGE-BSA (0.95
mg/mL), (E) incubated with nonglycated BSA at a protein con-
centration equivalent to 40 AU/mL of AGE-BSA (3.81 mg/mL),
and (F) incubated with L-NAME at 300 µM, in both control and
MS rats. The percentage of the response in each experimental
group was calculated in relation to the tension developed by the
same ring during its basal contraction.

Immunohistochemistry of RAGEs
Aortic rings of both MS and C rats were quickly frozen in
Tissue-Tek (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA). Sec-
tions were ﬁxed with acetone and were blocked with PBS/Azide
0.02%/BSA 1% for 30 min.

Subsequently, sections were incubated during 2 h at room
temperature with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against RAGE
(1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Pri-
mary antibodies were detected by using goat anti-rabbit FITC
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. West Grove, PA),
at room temperature for 60 min. Negative controls were prepared

by substituting the primary antibody with an irrelevant antibody.
Staining was analyzed using ﬂuorescence microscopy.

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± standard errors of the mean
(SEM) from 6 to 10 different artery preparations. The percentage
of contraction in each experiment was calculated, and the mean
was then determined. When applicable (comparisons between
two values; MS and controls), statistical analysis was done
by Student’s t-test. Comparisons between groups were done by
analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Anova on ranks followed by
Student–Newman–Keuls or Dunn’s tests, depending on whether
the data were normally distributed or not, using the SigmaStat
2.0 program (Jandel Scientiﬁc, San Rafael, CA). Differences
were considered statistically signiﬁcant when P < 0.05.
