Branched glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (bGDGTs) are known as bacterial lipids
that occur widely in terrestrial environments, particularly in anaerobic peat bogs and soil.
We examined the abundance and distribution of bGDGTs in both core (C) and polar (P) lipid
fractions from the water column and surface sediments in the lower Pearl River (PR) and
its estuary using two extraction methods (sonication vs. Bligh and Dyer). A number of soil
samples in the lower PR drainage basin were also collected and extracted for bGDGTs using
the sonication method. The results showed aquatic production of bGDGTs as supported
by substantial abundances of P-bGDGTs in the water column and sediment samples. The
bGDGT-based proxies (BIT, CBT, and MBT) were not affected by the method of extraction
when C-bGDGTs were analyzed; in such case, the pHCBT of the sediments reﬂected the
soil pH of the lower PR drainage basin, and the temperature close to the annual mean air
temperature (MAT) in the lower PR basin. On the other hand, the P-bGDGT-derived proxies
were inconsistent between the two methods. The P-bGDGTs (particularly those extracted
using the sonication method) may not be reliable indicators of annual MATs.

INTRODUCTION
Rivers and coastal regions play a key role in the global biogeo-
chemical cycle of carbon because they represent a fundamental,
multi-faceted link between the atmosphere, land, and ocean (Ray-
mond and Cole, 2003; Cole et al., 2007; Mayorga, 2008). Rivers are
known to be the main channels delivering terrestrial particulate-
and dissolved organic matter into the ocean as the majority of the
global burial of organic carbon in the ocean is found in margins
adjacent to rivers (e.g., Hedges and Keil, 1995; Goni et al., 2006).
Increasing evidence further indicates that rivers may constitute a
moving bioreactor with interactions occurring between microbial
communities and the river organic and/or inorganic constituents
(e.g., Dagg et al., 2005; Duan and Bianchi, 2006).

Estuaries are dynamic environments where the transportation
of terrestrial organic matter from rivers to oceans occurs, and water
chemistry changes dramatically between ocean and river environ-
ments. The composition of organic matter can also change in the
estuary as a result of mixing and enhanced physical, chemical, and
microbial reworking of the organic matter (Hedges et al., 1988;
Zimmerman and Canuel, 2001; Zhu et al., 2011a).

Recently a number of novel proxies have been developed that
are thought to reﬂect terrestrial environmental signals because
biomarkers constituting these novel proxies are known to be
ubiquitously and predominantly produced in soil and peat bogs

(Hopmans et al., 2004; Weijers et al., 2006a, 2007a). These include
methylation index of branched tetraethers (MBT), cyclization
ratio of branched tetraethers (CBT) and branched and isoprenoid
tetraethers (BIT), which all consist of glycerol dialkyl glycerol
tetraethers (GDGTs; Hopmans et al., 2004; Weijers et al., 2007a).
CBT and MBT utilize compounds produced by organisms of
unknown origin but appear to be from bacteria found in terres-
trial environments (Weijers et al., 2006b; Sinninghe Damsté et al.,
2011). In particular, CBT is known to reﬂect soil pH (Weijers et al.,
2007a; Peterse et al., 2009) and CBT and MBT in combination can
reﬂect annual mean air temperature (MAT; Weijers et al., 2007a;
Sun et al., 2011). These proxies have been increasingly used for past
continental temperature (Weijers et al., 2007b,c, 2011; Ballantyne
et al., 2010; Peterse et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011) or pH (Weijers
et al., 2007b; Tyler et al., 2010; Fawcett et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011)
determinations as well as for paleotemperature determinations in
continental margins (Weijers et al., 2007b,c; Schouten et al., 2008;
Rueda et al., 2009; Bendle et al., 2010) or lakes (Tyler et al., 2010;
Zink et al., 2010).

The BIT index was originally developed to reﬂect the rela-
tive abundances of marine crenarchaeol and terrestrial branched
tetraethers in a marine setting, which serves as a unique proxy for
transport of terrestrial carbon to marine environments (Hopmans
et al., 2004). An increasing number of studies have used BIT to

bGDGTs in Pearl River/estuary

address transport of terrestrial organic matter from rivers into the
marine system (Herfort et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2006, 2007, 2009,
2010; Huguet et al., 2007; van Dongen et al., 2008; Walsh et al.,
2008; Belicka and Harvey, 2009; Schmidt et al., 2010; Smith et al.,
2010; Zhu et al., 2011b). A general observation of these studies is
that the terrestrial organic matter preserved in marine sediments
as estimated by BIT reﬂects mostly soil origin (Walsh et al., 2008;
Belicka and Harvey, 2009; Weijers et al., 2009). On the other hand,
crenarchaeol is known to be present in soil (e.g., Leininger et al.,
2006), lakes (e.g., Powers et al., 2004), rivers (e.g., Herfort et al.,
2006), and terrestrial hot springs (Pearson et al., 2004; Zhang et al.,
2006), which can complicate the interpretation of BIT in certain
geological settings.

All of those studies focused on the core lipids of bGDGTs.
Recently, intact polar lipids (IPL) of bGDGTs have been examined
in soil or peat bogs (Liu et al., 2010; Peterse et al., 2010; Weijers
et al., 2011) and a lake (Tierney et al., 2011). The IPL of bGDGTs
are lower in abundance than the core lipids of bGDGTs in soil
(Peterse et al., 2010; Weijers et al., 2011) or peat (Liu et al., 2010)
but respond similarly to pH variations as do the core lipids in soil
(Peterse et al., 2010). Mounting evidence indicates that branched
tetraether lipids can be produced in situ in aquatic environments
including fjords (Peterse et al., 2009), lakes (Sinninghe Damsté
et al., 2009; Tierney and Russell, 2009; Sun et al., 2011; Tierney
et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012), and estuaries (Zhu et al., 2011b).
These observations warn that cautions should be exercised when
using BIT, CBT, or MBT as proxies for soil input into marine
or lacustrine sediments or for estimating changes in paleo-air
temperatures of continental settings.

The Pearl River is the second largest river in China and together
with the Mekong River it provides the largest inﬂow of fresh water
to the South China Sea (Hu et al., 2006a, 2009). It discharges
∼3.26× 1011 m3 of fresh water and ∼7× 107 tons of sediment
annually to the South China Sea. However, 80% of the sediment is
estimated to be deposited within the Pearl River estuary (Wai et al.,
2004). A number of studies have examined the terrestrial inputs of
organic matter to the Pearl River estuary and adjacent South China
Sea by looking at dissolved organic carbon (e.g., Callahan et al.,
2004; Chen et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2006a), particulate organic car-
bon (e.g., Chen et al., 2003), or sedimentary organic matter (He
et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2010). Molecular biomarker studies show
increased terrestrial signals from the Pearl River mouth to the
inner estuary and enhanced marine conditions further offshore
(Hu et al., 2006b, 2009).

Here we present initial measurements of both core lipids and
polar lipids (PL; see the deﬁnition of PLs in Material and Meth-
ods) of branched GDGTs from the lower Pearl River to the estuary.
Our goal was to delineate the sources of bGDGTs in estuary envi-
ronments and evaluate the potential use of these biomarkers for
paleo-continental climate studies in the region. In particular, the
PLs can add additional insight into the sources of the in situ pro-
duction of bGDGTs in these systems. We chose the Pearl River
for examining the sources and distribution of bGDGTs because
this system has been well characterized in terms of the distribu-
tion and degradation of terrestrial organic matter, which would
provide a good context for studying the bGDGT-dynamics at
the land-sea interface. Our results show in situ production of

bGDGTs in the lower Pearl River and the estuary, with a signif-
icant decrease in the abundance of core lipids from fresh water to
brackish water. The pH of the sediments as calculated from core
(C)-bGDGTs-derived CBT reﬂects the soil environment of the
lower Pearl River drainage basin, and the temperatures recorded
by the C-bGDGTs in the sediments reﬂect the annual MATs of the
lower Pearl River drainage basin. On the other hand, temperatures
calculated from the polar (P)-bGDGTs are signiﬁcantly lower than
those from the C-bGDGTs, suggesting that P-bGDGTs (particu-
larly those extracted using the sonication method) may not be
reliable indicators of annual MATs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DESCRIPTION OF FIELD SITE
The lower Pearl River is a complex water system that consists
of three main tributaries: Beijing (North River), Dongjiang (East
River) and Xijiang (West River; Figure 1). Discharge of freshwater
by the Pearl River goes through three sub-estuaries: Lingdingyang,
Modaomen and Huangmaohai (Figure 1). Nearly half of the
freshwater ﬂows through Lingdingyang, which is a North–South
bell-shaped area with a length of about 49 km and a width varying
from 4 to 48 km (Hu et al., 2006a, 2009). The average water depth
of the Lingdingyang is 4.8 m, increasing from north to south and
west to east (Hu et al., 2009). The average tidal range is 1–2 m and
the tidal current is 1–2 m/s (Hu et al., 2009). The sedimentation
rates vary in the estuary/shelf system, with 1.13–2.34 cm/year in
the coastal regions (Jia and Peng, 2003) and 0.2–1.0 cm/year on
the shelf (Owen and Lee, 2004). The age of the surface sediment
(the top 10 cm) is estimated to be 5–10 years in the estuary/shelf
system (Hu et al., 2006a).

The lower Pearl River region is characterized by humid sub-
tropical weather with annual MAT of about 22˚C and annual
precipitation of 1200–2200 mm (Zhang et al., 2008). Vegetation
in this tropical region is dominated by C3 plants with C4 grasses
being a minor component; however, sugarcane (a C4 plant) is one
of the major agricultural products in the region today (Yu et al.,
2010). Soil pH in this region ranges from 4.07 to 7.22 (Wong et al.,
2002).

COLLECTION OF WATER, SEDIMENT, AND SOIL SAMPLES
A cruise in July 2010 collected samples in the Beijing tributary
and the Lingdingyang estuary (Figure 1). Water samples were col-
lected at 14 stations, which included 10 in the lower Pearl River and
4 in the estuary (Table 1). The river stations included both main
channel and sub-tributary samples. Samples from the estuary were
collected from both surface and bottom water layers.

At each station in the river, water at a depth of 1–3 m was col-
lected into a 200-L plastic barrel using a submersible pump. The
barrel was rinsed with the river water three times before being
ﬁlled. The pump was then connected to a ﬁltration system that
held three 142-mm glass-ﬁber ﬁlters in parallel. The ﬁlters had
been combusted at 450˚C overnight and weighed individually at
room temperature prior to the cruise. The total volume of water
for all three ﬁlters was recorded and the ﬁlters were then care-
fully transferred to sterile 50-mL centrifuge tubes, which were
immediately stored in a liquid nitrogen container. Finally, sus-
pended particulate matter was collected using 0.45-μm ﬁlters by

ﬁltering 10–20 L of water. Before water was collected using the
submersible pump, a Horiba instrument (Model W-20XD, Kyoto,
Japan) was used for in situ determination of water depth, salinity,
and temperature.

Surface sediment (0–10 cm) in the river and estuary was col-
lected using a portable device. The sediment was collected into
50-mL centrifuge tubes and stored in the liquid nitrogen container
upon collection (exception was samples for grain size analyses,
which were stored under ambient temperature conditions).

Soil samples (from the top 5–10 cm) were collected at 20 loca-
tions along the bank of the Beijing tributary and local drainage
basin (Figure 1) because this tributary contributes the vast major-
ity of sediments in the estuary. The surface soil samples were
collected in 50-mL centrifuge tubes and immediately stored in the
liquid nitrogen container. Additional soil material was collected
into plastic bags for analysis of grain sizes.

ANALYSES OF ORGANIC CARBON FROM SEDIMENTS AND SOIL
In the laboratory, aliquots of freeze-dried sediment or soil sam-
ples were homogenized for acidiﬁcation in 10% HCl, washed with
deionized water to remove chloride, and subsequently dried at
80˚C overnight for analysis of total organic carbon (TOC) using
an organic element analyzer EA1110 (Carlo Erba). The carbon
isotopes of the TOC were then determined on the GV-Isoprime
EA IRMS with a precision of 0.1% for δ13C, which is deﬁned as
[(13C/12C)sa/(13C/12C)std − 1]× 1000 (where sa, sample, and std,

standard).

MEASUREMENTS OF pH, SALINITY, AND GRAIN SIZES OF SEDIMENTS
AND SOIL
The pH of soil and sediment was determined by drying the sam-
ples, which were then pulverized and prepared for each as slurry
by adding ultrapure water to the sample powder in a ratio of 1:2.5

(g/mL). The pH of the slurry was determined in the upper solution
using a pH meter (Mettler Toledo, USA) after homogenization of
the slurry and settling of particles to the bottom of the container.
Pore water salinity was measured using a salinity refractome-
ter (Sino Science and Technology Co., China) after sediment pore
water was collected through centrifugation (4000 rpm) and ﬁltered
through 0.45-μm cellulose acetate membranes.

Grain size analysis followed Xiao et al. (2009). Brieﬂy, about
0.15 g of sediment or soil material was pretreated with 10-mL of
30% H2O2 to remove organic matter and then with 15 mL of 25%
acetic acid to remove carbonates. NaOH was used under boiling
conditions to remove biogenic silicate. The residue (in 50 mL solu-
tion) was dispersed with 300 mg of (NaPO3)6 and boiled for 1 min,
then cooled down and ultrasonicated for about 3 min before grain
size analysis. The grain size distribution was determined using a
laser diffraction size analyzer (Beckman Co., USA), which had a
mechanical reproducibility of better than ±1% for the median
diameter.

LIPID EXTRACTION AND LC–MS ANALYSIS
The freeze-dried sediments and soil were homogenized with a
mortar and pestle and frozen ﬁlters were cut into pieces before
lipid extraction. One of the serial ﬁlters or 5-g dry sediment/soil
was extracted by sonication (10 min, 3× each) with methanol,
dichloromethane (DCM)/methanol (1:1, v/v), and DCM, respec-
tively, with centrifugation being used after each extraction. The
supernatants were pooled, carefully evaporated to dryness under
a nitrogen stream at 40˚C, re-dissolved in a small amount of n-
hexane/DCM (9:1, v/v), and separated into apolar and polar frac-
tions by sequential elution of the total lipids through an activated
silica column using n-hexane/DCM (9:1, v/v) and DCM/methanol
(1:1, v/v), respectively. Half of the polar fraction was condensed,
dissolved in n-hexane/isopropanol (99:1, v/v), and ﬁltered through

a 0.45-μm PTFE ﬁlter prior to analysis. The other half of the polar
fraction was hydrolyzed (4 h, 70˚C) in 5% HCl/methanol (v/v).
DCM and MilliQ water were added and the DCM fraction was col-
lected (repeated 4×). The DCM fraction was washed (6×) with
MilliQ water in order to remove acid, and dried under N2. The
hydrolyzed fraction was also re-dissolved in n-hexane/isopropanol
(99:1, v/v) and ﬁltered through 0.45 μm PTFE ﬁlters prior to analy-
sis on the LC–MS. The difference in LC–MS results between the
hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed polar fractions is considered to
be the IPLs (Huguet et al., 2010b). However, because we did not
identify the head groups of the IPLs, the hydrolyzed product may
include other fractions not in the form of the IPLs. Thus in this
study we consider this difference to be the PL.

A modiﬁed Bligh and Dyer extraction procedure (White et al.,
1979) is preferred for evaluation of intact polar GDGTs from nat-
ural environments (Pitcher et al., 2009; Peterse et al., 2010; Tierney
et al., 2011; Weijers et al., 2011). This method was also used for
extraction of GDGTs from the ﬁlter and sediment samples.

The GDGTs were analyzed on an Agilent 1200 liquid chro-
matography equipped with an automatic injector coupled to QQQ
6460 MS and Mass Hunter LC–MS manager software using a
procedure modiﬁed from Hopmans et al. (2004) and Schouten
et al. (2007). Separation of peaks was achieved using a Prevail
Cyano column (2.1 mm× 150 mm, 3 μm; Alltech Deeriﬂed, IL,
USA) maintained at a temperature of 40˚C. Injection volume was
5 μL. GDGTs were ﬁrst eluted isocratically with 90% A and 10%
B for 5 min, followed by a linear gradient to 18% B in 45 min.
Solvent was held for 10 min in 100% B and was then allowed to
re-equilibrate in a mixture of A:B (9:1, v/v) for 10 min. A rep-
resents n-hexane and B is a mixture of 90% n-hexane and 10%
isopropanol.

Detection of GDGTs was performed using the Agilent 6460
triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) with an atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ion source. The scanning type
used was single ion monitoring mode of protonated molecules.
The conditions for APCI/MS were as follows: nebulizer pressure

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
PRODUCTION OF bGDGTs IN WATER COLUMN AND SURFACE
SEDIMENTS
Water column
Concentrations of P-bGDGTs obtained from the sonication and
Bligh and Dyer methods showed large variations and an overall
decrease from the lower PR to the estuary (Figure 2A). When using
the sonication method, P-bGDGTs had a range of 0.24–2.0 μg/g
SPM (average= 1.04± 0.56 μg/g SPM, n = 9) in the lower PR
and a range of 0.05–0.76 μg/g SPM (average= 0.34± 0.30 μg/g
SPM, n = 7) in the estuary (Figures 3A,B; Table 1). The Bligh and
Dyer method yielded lower concentrations of P-bGDGTs, which
had a range of 0.23–1.64 μg/g SPM (average= 0.75± 0.46 μg/g
SPM, n = 9) in the lower PR and a range of 0.01–0.21 (aver-
age= 0.08± 0.07 μg/g SPM, n = 7) in the estuary (Figures 3A,B;
Table 1). Overall, larger variations in P-bGDGTs are associated
with the sonication method than with the Bligh and Dyer for the
water column samples (Figures 3A,B).

Sediments
Concentrations of P-bGDGTs in sediments had large variations
in the lower PR (Figure 2B). In the lower PR, the sonication
method yielded P-bGDGTs concentrations in a range of 2.2–
52.7 ng/g sediment (0.2–2.6 μg/g TOC) with an average value of
17.1± 14.9 ng/g sediment (1.1± 0.7 μg/g TOC, n = 9; Figure 3C;
Table 2); the Bligh and Dyer method yielded P-bGDGTs in a
range of 6.4–46.7 ng/g sediment (0.2–4.4 μg/g TOC) with an
average value of 33.6± 7.9 ng/g sediment (2.6± 1.2 μg/g TOC;
Figure 3C; Table 2). In the estuary, the two methods yielded sim-
ilar concentrations of P-bGDGTs at each station (Table 2), which
had an average value of 15.4± 8.9 ng/g sediment (1.8± 0.7 μg/g
TOC; n = 3) from the sonication method and 18.5± 8.7 ng/g

sediment (2.2± 0.3 μg/g TOC) from the Bligh and Dyer method
(Figure 3D).

The difference in P-bGDGTs concentration between the two
methods was further evaluated using the student t-test, which
gave P-values >0.05 for all water column samples from the lower
PR and the estuary. In the sediments, however, the P-value was
<0.05 in the lower PR and >0.05 in the estuary. This indicates that
these two methods statistically yielded similar concentrations of
P-bGDGTs in the water column; whereas in sediments the Bligh
and Dyer method yielded signiﬁcantly higher P-bGDGTs in the
lower PR than the sonication method (Table 2).
When normalized to total bGDGTs (P-bGDGTs+ C-bGDGTs),
the P-bGDGTs in the water column averaged 50.4± 18.8% in
the lower PR and 69.5± 16.1% in the estuary, by the sonication
method (Table 1). On the other hand, the relative abundance of
P-bGDGTs from the Bligh and Dyer method was much lower,
averaging 21.6% for both the lower PR and the estuary (Table 1),
which were both statistically (P < 0.05) lower than the sonication
method. This lower ratio was apparently caused by the greater con-
centrations of C-bGDGTs produced by the Bligh and Dyer method
than the sonication method (Figures 3A,B). In the sediments, the
sonication method yielded 6.9± 3.8% of P-bGDGTs in total lipids
in the lower PR, which was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) lower than the
Bligh and Dyer method (14.2± 8.6%; Table 2), mostly due to the
higher concentrations of the P-bGDGTs by the latter method (avg.
33.6 ng/g vs. 17.1 ng/g; Table 2).

bGDGTs in Pearl River/estuary

FIGURE 3 | Comparison of concentrations of C- and P-bGDGTs extracted using the sonication (Soni) and Bligh and Dyer (BD) methods for water
column (A,B) and sediment (C,D) samples from the lower Pearl River and estuary. CL, core lipids; PL, polar lipids.

The soil samples were analyzed using the sonication method
only, which yielded P-bGDGTs having a range of 0.5–146.2 ng/g
in soil (0.1–12.8 μg/g TOC; Table 3). The relative abundance of P-
bGDGTs in total lipids had a range of 1.4–31.0%, with an average
value of 7.8± 7.1% (n = 20), which is close to the average value of
P-bGDGTs in the sediments of the lower PR (Table 2).

One caveat associated with the sonication method is that the
PLs may be matrix-bonded rather than originating from intact
microbial cells (Huguet et al., 2010a). This might be the case for
the water column ﬁlters, which tended to yield higher concentra-
tions of P-bGDGTs by the sonication method than by the Bligh
and Dyer method (Table 1), even though the student t -test did
not show a signiﬁcant difference between the two methods for each
sample. On the other hand, concentrations of P-bGDGTs from the
lower PR sediments were signiﬁcantly lower when determined by
the sonication method than by the Bligh and Dyer, which is incon-
sistent with the excess extraction of PLs that are matrix-bonded
when sonication is used (Huguet et al., 2010a). This suggests that
the yield of matrix-bonded PLs may be affected by the structure
and composition of the solids with which the lipids are bonded.
The difference may also be caused by speciﬁc procedures used in
each lab or by other unknown variables. The factors causing the
differences in the yield of P-bGDGTs in different methods are not
well understood.

Only a few studies have reported the abundances of P-bGDGTs
in soil and peat bog environments and used them as biomarkers
of living organisms (Liu et al., 2010; Peterse et al., 2010; Weijers

et al., 2011). In this study, the P-bGDGTs in soil and sediments
are in the same range as reported by Peterse et al. (2010) and Wei-
jers et al. (2011). Early studies have showed that C-bGDGTs are
widespread in soil and peat bogs (e.g., Weijers et al., 2006a, 2007a)
and bGDGTs observed in marine systems are mostly derived from
the terrestrial environments (Hopmans et al., 2004; Weijers et al.,
2006a,b). However, it has been shown that the in situ production of
bGDGTs appeared to contribute to some of the observed bGDGTs
in a fjord environment where soil organic matter was low (Peterse
et al., 2009). Most recently, in situ production of bGDGTs in the
oxic East China Sea shelf was also reported (Zhu et al., 2011b).
Both studies made the conclusions using measurements of core
lipids. The ubiquitous presence of P-bGDGTs from ﬁlter and sed-
iment samples in the Pearl River and estuary further supports
those observations and indicates that living organisms producing
P-bGDGTs may be present in these environments. However, the
source of bGDGTs in the oxic water column is unknown. One
possibility may be the production by aerobic or facultative aerobic
organisms in the oxic water; the other possibility may be produc-
tion by anaerobic organisms that reside in suspended particles
containing micro-anoxic environments.

CORRELATIONS BETWEEN ABUNDANCES OF bGDGTs AND pH OR TOC
IN SEDIMENTS
bGDGTs were normalized to the clay fraction when compared
with TOC because the abundance of bGDGTs tended to be higher
with increasing clay content (data not shown). In the sediments,

the abundances of C-bGDGTs from either the sonication or Bligh
and Dyer increased signiﬁcantly with TOC for concentration up
to 2.5% (Figure 4). The P-bGDGTs from both methods remained
low (<5%) with increasing TOC; one exception was the sample
having the highest TOC, which had much higher P-bGDGT abun-
dance from the sonication extraction than from the Bligh and Dyer
method (Table 2). In the soil samples, no signiﬁcant correlations
existed between C-bGDGTs and TOC or between P-bGDGTs and
TOC from both methods (data not shown). The results suggest
that the abundance of C-bGDGTs was affected by the availability
of TOC in the sediments but not in soils within the study area;
and that the abundance of P-bGDGTs was insensitive to changes
in TOC.

The correlation between clay-normalized bGDGTs and pH had
a maximum around pH 7.4 (Figure 4B). When normalized to
the content of TOC, a more signiﬁcant negative correlation was
observed for bGDGTs obtained from the sonication method than
the Bligh and Dyer method (Figure 4C). Similarly, in soil samples,
no correlation existed between pH and abundance of either C- or
P-bGDGTs normalized to TOC, or when normalized to soil clay
fractions (data not shown).

The pH–bGDGT correlation for the sediment samples in this
study is consistent with observations from Weijers et al. (2007a)
in a global survey of soil bGDGTs. A long-term soil manipulation

also shows that soil pH is the only varying control on the abun-
dance and distribution of branched GDGTs (Peterse et al., 2010).
The lack of correlations between bGDGTs and pH in the PR
soil, however, suggests that other variables (other than TOC)
may play a role in controlling the abundance of bGDGTs in this
region.

CHANGES IN bGDGTs-DERIVED PROXIES FROM THE LOWER PEARL
RIVER TO ESTUARY
BIT, MBT, and CBT in the water column
The BIT values in the water column decreased in a non-
linear pattern for both the C- and P-bGDGTs in the lower PR
(cid:3)
(Figures 5A,A
). In the estuary, BIT values (for either C- or P-
bGDGTs) decreased sharply from above 0.81 at station 11 to less
(cid:3)
than 0.1 at station 14 in either method (Figures 5A,A
). The MBT
values for C-bGDGTs were relatively constant and around 0.6 from
the lower PR and estuary for the two methods (Figure 5B). The
MBT values for P-bGDGTs obtained from the Bligh and Dyer
method was also relatively constant and around 0.6; whereas, the
values obtained from the sonication method showed much larger
(cid:3)
variations (Figure 5B
). The CBT values showed larger variations
for both C- and P-bGDGTs in the lower PR than in the estuary,
with the former varying between 0.6 and 1.2 and the latter between
(cid:3)
0.4 and 1.4 in either method (Figures 5C,C

).

bGDGTs in Pearl River/estuary

IMPLICATIONS FOR CBT- AND MBT-DERIVED pH AND TEMPERATURES
CBT-derived pH
The CBT proxy is known to correlate with the pH of the envi-
ronment from which the bGDGTs are derived (e.g., Weijers
et al., 2007a; Peterse et al., 2010). In this study, a student t -
test was performed to compare calculated pH values from C-
bGDGTs and P-bGDGTs (extracted using either sonication or
Bligh and Dyer method) and compare them with the mea-
sured pH values (Figure 7). In the sonication method, the
CBT-derived pH values of soil samples showed large variations
and were statistically indifferent between the C- and P-bGDGTs,
with their average pH values similar to the measured average
soil pH value (6.56± 1.39, n = 20; Figure 7). These results sug-
gest that CBT-derived pH values statistically reﬂect the in situ
soil pH.

The CBT-derived pH values of the sediments in both the
sonication and Bligh and Dyer methods varied between the aver-
age measured pH values of the sediments (7.48± 0.34) and soil
(6.56± 1.39; Figure 7). For the sonication method, the student t -
test showed that the calculated pH values from either C-bGDGTs
or P-bGDGTs (Table A1 in Appendix) were signiﬁcantly differ-
ent from the measured individual sediment pH values (Table 2).
However, no signiﬁcant differences existed between sediment C-
or P-bGDGT-derived pH values and measured soil pH values
(Table 3), possibly due to the large variation of the measured
soil pH (Figure 7). Nevertheless, these results may suggest that the
sonication-derived CBT proxy reﬂects soil pH and not the in situ
sediment pH.

For the Bligh and Dyer method, the student t -test showed that
the pH values from the C-bGDGTs and P-bGDGTs were signif-
icantly different (Table A2 in Appendix), with the latter close to
the average measured sediment pH value (Figure 7) and signiﬁ-
cantly different from the average measured soil pH (P < 0.05). On
the other hand, no signiﬁcant difference existed in the average pH
value between sediment C-bGDGTs and soil.

These results indicate that using the sonication method both
C- and P-bGDGTs from the sediments likely reﬂect soil pH,
whereas using the Bligh and Dyer method the C-bGDGTs likely
reﬂect terrestrial soil pH but the P-bGDGTs may reﬂect in situ
sediment pH.

MBT/CBT-derived temperatures
The MBT–CBT proxy has been increasingly used to reconstruct
past annual MAT in continental margins or shelves (Weijers et al.,
2007b,c; Schouten et al., 2008; Donders et al., 2009; Bendle et al.,
2010; Fawcett et al., 2011; Peterse et al., 2011). While the annual
MAT in the lower PR basin is about 22˚C (Zhang et al., 2008), in
July when our cruise was carried out, a mean monthly tempera-
ture of 30˚C was recorded near the city of Guangzhou (Liu et al.,
2007). The measured water temperature averaged 30.4± 0.4˚C in
the lower PR and 28.8± 2.2˚C in the estuary with the bottom water
about 2.0–4.0˚C lower than the surface water (Table 1). Statisti-
cally, the water temperature was not signiﬁcantly different between
the lower PR and the estuary and the average was 29.8± 1.6˚C
between the two environments.

Temperatures calculated according to Weijers et al. (2007a)
resulted in higher values for C-bGDGTs than P-bGDGTs for

sonication (Soni) and Bligh and Dyer (BD) methods. CL, core lipids; PL,
polar lipids.

BIT, MBT, and CBT in the sediments
Variations in BIT, MBT, and CBT showed very little difference
between the two methods for the C-bGDGTs (Figures 6A–C).
For the P-bGDGTs, however, the proxies based on the son-
ication method varied more than those based on the Bligh
(cid:3)
and Dyer method (Figures 6A
). These results along with
those from the water column suggest that proxies derived from
C-bGDGTs are not affected by different extraction methods;
whereas, proxies derived from P-bGDGTs appeared to be more
stable based on the Bligh and Dyer method than the sonication
method.

all samples (Tables A1–A3 in Appendix). In soil samples, the
calculated temperatures had a range of 18.7–28.1˚C (average
24.3± 3.1˚C, n = 20) for C-bGDGTs and a range of −2.9 to 29.2˚C
(average 13.8± 1.1˚C) for P-bGDGTs (Figure 8). For the sedi-
ment samples, the calculated temperatures had similar ranges for
C-bGDGTs using either the sonication (Table A1 in Appendix)
or Bligh and Dyer (Table A2 in Appendix) method, with the for-
mer having an average temperature of 21.1± 1.0˚C and the latter
20.7± 1.1˚C (Figure 8). The P-bGDGTs again resulted in lower
values for either the sonication or Bligh and Dyer method, with
the former showing considerably greater variability than the latter
(Figure 8).

The calculated temperatures from the C-bGDGTs were all
closer to the mean annual air temperature (22˚C) of the region
than to the monthly MAT in July when the samples were taken
(Figure 8). The bGDGTs from sediments did not seem to regis-
ter any temperature signatures from the water column (average

29.8± 1.6˚C; Figure 8), which suggests that water column pro-
duction of bGDGTs in the lower PR and estuary did not have
a signiﬁcant impact on the sediment C-bGDGTs. These results
also indicate that temperatures calculated from the C-bGDGTs
were not affected by different extraction methods, whereas those
from the P-bGDGTs could be severely affected. The relatively
higher temperatures from the C-bGDGTs calculated for the soil
may indicate a seasonal bias favoring the period of the sum-
mer when soil samples were collected. However, Weijers et al.
(2011) showed no seasonal variation in MBT/CBT-derived tem-
peratures in mid-latitude soils. On the other hand, even if a slight
seasonal preference of bGDGT production does exists in soil, it
may be difﬁcult to separate from natural variability caused by
soil heterogeneity (Weijers et al., 2011). The temporal variation in
MBT/CBT temperatures in the lower PR requires further evalua-
tion by sampling in different seasons before a conclusion can be
drawn.

bGDGTs in Pearl River/estuary

FIGURE 6 | Changes in BIT, MBT, and CBT in the sediments from lower
Pearl River to the estuary for C-bGDGTs (A–C) and P-bGDGTs (A(cid:2)–C(cid:2)) for

the sonication and Bligh and Dyer (BD) methods. Zero distance is
arbitrarily set at PR-9 in Figure 1 and increasing distance is toward the estuary.

CONCLUSION
Increasing evidence indicates that bGDGTs can be produced in situ
in aquatic environments other than the soil, which has tradition-
ally been considered to be the major source of these compounds.
In this study, two extraction methods (sonication and Bligh and
Dyer) yield substantial amounts of P-bGDGTs in the water col-
umn and sediments, suggesting in situ production of bGDGTs in
the lower Pearl River and estuary. The BIT values decrease system-
atically from the lower Pearl River to the estuary and the pattern is
not inﬂuenced by the method of extraction. The bGDGTs-derived
temperature and pH proxies also are not affected by extraction
method when calculations are performed using the C-bGDGTs.
In such cases, the pHCBT values in sediments are not statistically
different from those of the surrounding soil, indicating that the
C-bGDGTs are predominantly derived from the terrestrial envi-
ronment. Similarly, temperatures calculated by the MBT–CBT
combination show no difference between the two methods using

the C-bGDGTs; the results of which are close to the mean annual
air temperature of the lower PR basin. These results suggest that
the MBT–CBT proxies derived from C-bGDGTs may be valid for
studying paleo-soil pH and continental air temperatures in the
lower Pearl River drainage basin. On the other hand, tempera-
tures calculated from the P-bGDGTs are signiﬁcantly lower than
those from the C-bGDGTs and may not be reliable indicators of
annual MATs.
