In some cyanobacteria, the color or prevalent wavelengths of ambient light can impact the
protein or pigment composition of the light-harvesting complexes. In some cases, light
color or quality impacts cellular morphology. The signiﬁcance of changes in pigmentation
is associated strongly with optimizing light absorption for photosynthesis, whereas the
signiﬁcance of changes in light quality-dependent cellular morphology is less well under-
stood. In natural aquatic environments, light quality and intensity change simultaneously at
varying depths of the water column.Thus, we hypothesize that changes in morphology that
also have been attributed to differences in the prevalent wavelengths of available light may
largely be associated with changes in light intensity. Fremyella diplosiphon shows highly
reproducible light-dependent changes in pigmentation and morphology. Under red light
(RL), F. diplosiphon cells are blue-green in color, due to the accumulation of high levels of
phycocyanin, a RL-absorbing pigment in the light-harvesting complexes or phycobilisomes
(PBSs), and the shape of cells are short and rounded. Conversely, under green light (GL),
F. diplosiphon cells are red in color due to accumulation of GL-absorbing phycoerythrin in
PBSs, and are longer and brick-shaped. GL is enriched at lower depths in the water column,
where overall levels of light also are reduced, i.e., to 10% or less of the intensity found at
the water surface. We hypothesize that longer cells under low light intensities at increas-
ing depths in the water column, which are generally also enriched in green wavelengths,
are associated with greater levels of total photosynthetic pigments in the thylakoid mem-
branes. To test this hypothesis, we grew F. diplosiphon under increasing intensities of GL
and observed whether the length of cells diminished due to reduced pressure to maintain
larger cells and the associated increased photosynthetic membrane capacity under high
light intensity, independent of whether it is light of green wavelengths.

INTRODUCTION
Due to ﬂuctuations in parameters of
the external environ-
ment, many biological organisms possess mechanisms for sensing
changes in their habitat. An ability to monitor environmental
changes is vitally important for organisms that have limited mobil-
ity and thus, must optimize their growth and development to
maximize survival in the locations in which they ﬁnd themselves.
Photosynthetic organisms are particularly sensitive to ﬂuctua-
tions in light in the external environment, as light is absorbed
and converted to chemical energy to support growth and survival.
Photomorphogenesis is the process by which such organisms alter
their growth and development in response to ﬂuctuations in light.
This process results in changes in growth, cellular development,
and metabolism in ways that optimize organismal survival and/or
limit damage.

One type of photomorphogenesis that has been long recognized
in some cyanobacteria is complementary chromatic adaptation
(CCA). During CCA, cyanobacteria alter their pigment or pro-
tein composition to maximize light absorption for photosynthesis

(Tandeau de Marsac, 1977), as well as sometimes exhibit changes
in ﬁlament length and cellular morphology (Bennett and Bogorad,
1973). Fremyella diplosiphon is the most widely studied cyanobac-
terium capable of CCA. Changes in pigmentation have been asso-
ciated deﬁnitively with increasing photosynthetic potential in this
ﬁlamentous cyanobacterium (Campbell, 1996).

F. diplosiphon is most sensitive to changes in the prevalence of
red and green wavelengths (Bennett and Bogorad, 1973). Under
red light (RL) conditions, the organism is blue-green in color
due to the accumulation of high levels of the RL-absorbing,
blue-colored pigment phycocyanin (PC) in the light-harvesting
complexes, or phycobilisomes (PBS), that are connected to the
chlorophyll-containing photosynthetic reaction centers (Bennett
and Bogorad, 1973). By contrast, under green light (GL) condi-
tions, F. diplosiphon is brick-red in color, due to accumulating
high levels of the GL-absorbing, red-colored phycoerythrin (PE)
pigment (Bennett and Bogorad, 1973). This light-dependent reg-
ulation of pigment accumulation is a photoreversible property
controlled by a complex two-component phosphorelay cascade

that is initiated by the activity of a light-responsive sensor kinase
regulator of chromatic adaptation E (RcaE; Kehoe and Grossman,
1996; Terauchi et al., 2004).

In addition to the pigmentation response, light-dependent
changes in the lengths of ﬁlaments and cellular morphology also
occur during CCA in F. diplosiphon (Bennett and Bogorad, 1973).
Cells are rounded and shorter and ﬁlament length is reduced
under RL, whereas under GL cells are longer and brick-shaped,
and ﬁlaments are longer (Bennett and Bogorad, 1973; Bordowitz
and Montgomery, 2008). The changes in cellular morphology
and pigmentation are photoreversible (Bennett and Bogorad,
1973; Bordowitz and Montgomery, 2008). The observed mor-
phological changes are controlled in part by the same complex
two-component regulatory Rca system that regulates the pigmen-
tation response (Bordowitz and Montgomery, 2008; Bordowitz
et al., 2010). However, light-dependent morphological changes
controlled by the Rca system were observed earlier than changes
in pigment levels (Bordowitz and Montgomery, 2008).

The changes in pigmentation in the accessory complexes of the
photosynthetic light-harvesting centers have clear roles in organis-
mal adaptation to changing light conditions-greater light absorp-
tion yields increased photosynthetic efﬁciency, which increases
the energy supply for growth and development. The ability to
optimize energy production in environments where ambient light
changes can lead to selective advantages for organisms exhibiting
such abilities (Stomp et al., 2008). However, there has been no clear
association of the morphological changes that are observed under
changing light conditions with a functionality that might beneﬁt
the organism, e.g., buoyancy in the water column or organismal
motility. It is noteworthy that in a natural context, the overall lev-
els of light, or light intensities, also change (Postius et al., 2001).
The prevalent wavelengths of light change with depth in the water
column – red-enriched light at or near the water surface versus
green-enriched light at signiﬁcant depths in the water column.
The total light available at depths where green wavelengths dom-
inate can be 10% or less than that near or at the water surface
(Postius et al., 2001).

Previously, we proposed a function for larger F. diplosiphon cells
under GL conditions to increase total light absorption in natural
environments where overall light levels are lower than near the
red-enriched surface (Montgomery, 2008). Therefore, the mor-
phology of these cells may be regulated by light quantity and color
in a complex way. To investigate whether the quantity of light
plays a signiﬁcant role in the regulation of cellular morphology,
we initiated experiments growing F. diplosiphon cultures under
increasing ﬂuences of GL over many successive dilutions to deter-
mine whether increasing the total available light could signal a
decrease in cell size, i.e., allow cellular adaptation, without chang-
ing the wavelength of light available. Such an investigation was
expected to provide insight into whether the amount of light avail-
able, independent of wavelength, impacts cellular morphology in
F. diplosiphon and impacts selective pressure to maintain longer
cells or cells of larger volume.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STRAINS AND CULTURE CONDITIONS
Fremyella diplosiphon UTEX 481 was used as wild-type (WT)
in this study. Cultures were grown at 28˚C in BG-11 medium

containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8 (hereafter BG-11/HEPES) with
shaking at ∼175 rpm under GL at λmax at 530 nm. A Li-Cor light
meter (model LI-250, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) with a connected
Li-Cor quantum sensor (model LI-190SA) was used to measure
light intensities.

REITERATIVE DILUTION OF CELLS
Cultures were initially started from a BG-11/HEPES plate of
WT cells growing under white ﬂuorescent room lights at room
temperature. After 7 days of growth under GL at 10, 50, 75,
−1, cultures were diluted to an absorbance at
or 100 μmol m
750 nm of ∼0.1 (OD750). Cells were then returned to the original
growth condition and diluted every 7 days to an OD750 of ∼0.1 for
ﬁve dilutions. Following these initial dilutions, cells were diluted
every 3 days to an OD750 of ∼0.1. Cells were imaged after the
5th, 8th, 17th, and 25th dilutions (Figure 1). After this extended
iterative dilution series, a culture of cells diluted to an OD750 of
−1 for
∼0.1 was moved from an intensity of 100 to 10 μmol m
3 days to investigate the impact of reversing high light exposure on
cellular morphology and physiology.

CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY-BASED ANALYSIS OF CELLULAR
MORPHOLOGY
Slides were prepared and imaged by confocal microscopy as
previously detailed (Bordowitz and Montgomery, 2008, 2010).
Both differential interference contrast (DIC) and autoﬂuores-
cence images were acquired using an inverted Axiovert 200 Zeiss
LSM 510 Meta confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM: Carl
Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY, USA). Cell lengths (n ≥ 50
for each condition) were measured, and acquired images were
processed using the LSM FCS Zeiss 510 Meta AIM imaging
software as detailed (Bordowitz and Montgomery, 2008, 2010).

RESULTS
Fremyella diplosiphon UTEX 481 cells were grown under increas-
ing ﬂuences of GL and reiteratively diluted over deﬁned inter-
vals to allow sequential generations of cells to be exposed to
increasing intensities of GL (Figure 1). As cells were cultured for
many generations under high intensity GL, the median lengths
of cells were observed to decrease. After more than 25 suc-
cessive dilutions, cells under high intensity GL of 50, 75, or
−1 were shorter and more rounded in appearance

appears to be attributed largely to the enlargement that appears
related to stress and/or vacuolation. However, these cells were still
shorter than the original length before exposure of cells to multiple
generations of high intensity GL (Table 1).

To conﬁrm stress-related impacts on the cells that had grown
under high intensity GL for many generations, we obtained
spectral scans and observed an increased peak at ∼480–490 nm
(Figure 3), indicative of carotenoid accumulation (Dere et al.,
1998). Light-induced carotenoid accumulation has been associ-
ated with stress in cyanobacteria (Gao et al., 2007). We quanti-
ﬁed light intensity-dependent accumulation of carotenoids and
determined that levels increased under increased light intensity

DISCUSSION
Our results support our hypothesis that light intensity plays a
signiﬁcant role in determining the morphology of F. diplosiphon
cells. Laboratory-based experiments conﬁrm that the adaptation
of these cells to both differences of light color (Bennett and Bogo-
rad, 1973; Bordowitz and Montgomery, 2008) and light intensity
(Figures 2 and 4) contributes to the change in cellular morphology
that can be observed reversibly in these cells. The changes that are
observed in cellular morphology in natural environments are, thus,
likely to result from a combination of light quality and quantity –
low intensities of green-enriched light are associated with longer
cells, whereas high intensities of red-enriched light are associated
with spherical cells. The light-dependent changes in cellular mor-
phology and ﬁlament morphology may impact stratiﬁcation of the
organism in the water column – i.e., increased buoyancy and abil-
ity to persist higher in the water column may be associated with
more rounded cells. A smaller surface area also may be associated
with a reduced cell surface area exposed to potential damage by
higher light intensities near the surface. Conversely, a larger cell

volume associated with green wavelengths and lower intensities of
light at lower water column depths may be associated with a greater
accumulation of total photosynthetic pigments to increase overall
cellular photosynthetic efﬁciency. Notably, Trichodesmium ery-
thraeum ISM101 is a non-heterocystous diazotrophic cyanobac-
terium that can live at both the surface and deep in the water
column (Andresen et al., 2010). At lower depths, the organism
exhibits longer ﬁlaments and cells that have a larger diameter
(Andresen et al., 2010), indicating that for this organism, lower
light intensity is associated with longer ﬁlaments and larger cells,

similar to F. diplosiphon. In T. erythraeum, the increased cellular
diameter at lower depths and reduced light intensity is associated
with an increase in total light absorption per cell (Andresen et al.,
2010). Taken together with our observations for F. diplosiphon,
these results demonstrate that cyanobacterial cells can regulate
morphology based on the quantity of light available, which in
addition to prevalent light quality varies at different depths in the
water column. Light intensity also impacts cellular elongation in
plants for which hypocotyl and stem elongation are controlled by
both light quality and light quantity detected by the phytochrome
photoreceptors (Ballaré et al., 1991).

Changes in cellular morphology are associated with a number
of acclimations and/or adaptations to variations in external envi-
ronmental parameters in cyanobacteria (reviewed in Singh and
Montgomery, 2011). These parameters can include abiotic and
biotic factors and/or stresses. The changes in cyanobacterial mor-
phology and physiology that are induced by environmental varia-
tions are associated with organismal responses for limiting detri-
mental impacts of environmental ﬂuctuations, while maximizing
survival (for review see Singh and Montgomery, 2011).

The high light adaptation of cellular morphology that we
observe in F. diplosiphon is reversible. The exact nature of the mol-
ecular changes associated with this adaptation to higher intensity
light over several generations requires additional experimentation.

Prior studies in cyanobacteria have identiﬁed a number of
molecular factors associated with the control of morphology. For
example, the presence of bacterial actin MreB has been previously
shown to be correlated with rod-shaped cells in the cyanobac-
terium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (Hu et al., 2007). When mreB is
mutated in this cyanobacterium, cells are spherical in shape (Hu
et al., 2007). Also, mutant studies in the unicellular cyanobac-
terium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 demonstrated that
lipopolysaccharide assembly is correlated with the regulation of
cell division and cellular morphology (Dolganov and Grossman,
1993). Peptidoglycan structure also has been implicated as impor-
tant for apposite regulation of cell shape in cyanobacteria (Leganés
et al., 2005; Lehner et al., 2011). Recent studies in F. diplosiphon
demonstrated that the protein FdTonB is associated with the pho-
toregulation of cellular morphology under GL (Pattanaik and
Montgomery, 2010). It is not yet clear whether any or all of
these components are involved in the observed light intensity-
dependent changes in morphology in F. diplosiphon. Furthermore,
whether the photoregulatory mechanisms associated with the
changes observed here under high intensity GL are the same ones
invoked during the photoreversible changes in cell shape observed
during CCA, e.g., the Rca system (Bordowitz and Montgomery,
2008; Bordowitz et al., 2010), CpeR (Pattanaik et al., 2011), or
FdTonB (Pattanaik and Montgomery, 2010), requires additional
investigation.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The regulation of cellular morphology in F. diplosiphon is corre-
lated with changes in light intensity, suggesting that morphol-
ogy is regulated as a means of modulating total light absorp-
tion per cell that is associated with overall cellular photosyn-
thetic capacity. The mechanisms by which this is accomplished
will require further studies. Yet, the association of changes in
cellular morphology with light intensity represents an advance
in our understanding of the potential purpose(s) of the pho-
toregulation of cellular morphology in cyanobacteria in natural
habitats.
