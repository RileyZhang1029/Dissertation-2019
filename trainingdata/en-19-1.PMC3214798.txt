ABSTRACT

Parkinson’s  disease  (PD)  and  Alzheimer’s  Disease  (AD)  are  severe  neurodegene-
rative  disorders,  with  no  drugs  that  are  currently  approved  to  prevent  the  neuronal  cell 
loss  characteristic  in  brains  of  patients  suffering  from  PD  and  AD  and  all  drug 
treatment  are  synptomactic.  Due  to  the  complex  pathophysiology,  including  a  cascade 
of  neurotoxic  molecular  events  that  results  in  neuronal  death  and  predisposition  to 
depression  and  eventual  dementia  and  etiology  of  these  disorders,  an  innovative 
approach  towards  neuroprotection  or  neurorestoration  (neurorescue)  may  be  the  de-
velopment  and  use  of  multifunctional  pharmaceuticals.  Such  drugs  target  an  array  of 
pathological  pathways,  each  of  which  is  believed  to  contribute  to  the  cascades  that 
ultimately  lead  to  neuronal  cell  death.  In  this  short  review,  we  discuss  examples  of 
novel  multifunctional  ligands  that  may  have  potential  as  neuroprotective-neurorestora-
tive  therapeutics  in  PD  and  AD.  The  compounds  discussed  originate  from  synthetic 
chemistry  as  well  as  from  natural  sources.

INTRODUCTION

    Parkinson’s  disease  (PD)  is  an  age-related  neu-
rodegenerative  disease  with  progressive 
loss  of 
dopaminergic  (DA)  neurons  in  the  substantia  nigra 
pars  compacta  (SNpc).  In  patients,  this  depletion  of 
neurons  presents  clinically  with  severe  motor  symp-
toms  including  uncontrollable  resting  tremor,  bradi-

kinesia,  rigidity  and  postural  imbalance  (Lang  and 
Lozano,  1998a;  1998b;  Lotharius  and  Brundin, 
2002).  These  symptoms,  which  affect  1%  of  in-
dividuals  over  the  age  of  65,  start  to  manifest  when 
70∼80%  of  DA  neurons  in  the  SNpc  are  lost 
(Mandel  et  al.,  2003;  Meissner  et  al.,  2004).  The 
exact  etiology  of  PD  remains  to  be  fully  elucidated, 
but  the  key  theories  propose  either  an  environmen-
tal  (e.g.  insecticides  (Calne  et  al.,  1987;  Schoen-
berg,  1987;  Paolini  et  al.,  2004))  or  a  genetic  (e.g. 
parkin  (Kitada  et  al.,  1998))  origin,  or  a  combination 
of  both. 
    In  2009,  the  market  value  for  PD  and  AD  the-
rapies  exceeded  US$6.5  billion,  (Schapira  et  al., 

activities,  rasagiline  is  currently  only  drug  that  may 
have  a  disease  modifying  activity  (Olanow  et  al., 
2009).
    Recent  literature  show  that  there  has  been  a 
paradigm  shift  in  the  way  researchers  are  con-
sidering  the  development  and  design  of  drugs  to 
treat  diseases  with  complex  etiological  pathways 
(i.e.  diseases  with  multiple  drug  targets)  (Morphy  et 
al.,  2004;  Gal  et  al.,  2005;  Morphy  and  Rankovic, 
2005;  Youdim  and  Buccafusco,  2005a;  2005b;  Van 
der  Schyf  et  al.,  2006a;  2006b;  Zimmermann  et  al., 
2007).  In  a  pathway  system  with  a  multitude  of 
drug  targets,  a  drug  with  a  single-target  mechanism 
of  action  cannot  always  compensate  or  correct  a 
complex  pathway,  which  suggests  that  a  complex 
pathway  disease  should  be  treated  1)  with  a  mul-
titude  of  molecules,  each  acting  on  different  path-
ways  in  the  disease  (polypharmacy),  or  2)  with  one 
molecule  that  possesses  promiscuous  activity  acting 
on  different  pathways  (multiple  mechanism  drugs). 
    Polypharmacy  (Fig.  1)  therefore,  is  the  clinical 
practice  of  combining  two  or  more  medications  in  a 
patient’s  medication  profile,  with  a  view  to  treat  one 
specific  disease.  For  example,  the  combination  use

cer  as  the  second  most  common  cause  of  death  of 
the  elderly  (Lang  and  Lozano,  1998a).  Therefore, 
there  is  a  real  sense  of  urgency  to  discover  novel 
therapies  for  the  treatment  or  preferably,  prevention 
of  these  diseases.  Currently  the  only  therapies 
approved  for  the  treatment  of  PD  and  AD  are 
agents  that  attenuate  the  symptoms  (symptomatic) 
of  the  disease  without  disease  modifying  activity 
except  the  anti  Parkinson  drug  rasagiline  (Azilect) 
(Olanow  et  al.,  2009),  which  we  developed  (Youdim 
et  al.,  2005).  The  mainstay 
treatment 
focuses  on  the  replacement  of  lost  DA  with  L-dopa, 
dopamine  (DA)  agonists,  monoamine  oxidase  B 
inhibitors  and  catechol-O-methyl  tranferase  inhibi-
tors,  thereby  normalizing  the  patient  symptomatically 
(Schapira  et  al.,  2005).  While  for  AD  there  are  the 
cholinesterase  inhibitors  and  the  glutamate  anta-
gonist  memantine.  Tragically,  but  important  in  view 
of  the  seriousness  of  disease  progression,  is  the 
fact  that  the  course  of  the  disease  is  not  affected 
by  the  utilization  of  these  drugs,  and  the  loss  of 
neurons  continues  unabated  even  as  symptoms 
may  be  controlled,  at  least  following  initial  treat-
ment.  Currently,  no  drugs  with  claimed  neuropro-
tective  activity  have  been  approved  by  the  FDA  for 
the  treatment  of  PD  or  AD  (Table  1)  (Mandel  et  al., 
2003;  Stocchi  and  Olanow,  2003).  Significantly 
though,  recent  research  has  suggested  that  some 
drugs  used  for  symptomatic  relief  in  PD,  such  as 
Azilect,  pramipexole  (Hall  et  al.,  1996;  Dooley  and 
Markham,  1998;  Piercey,  1998)  and  memantine 
(Rogawski  and  Wenk,  2003;  Plosker  and  Lyseng- 
Williamson,  2005)  may  also  possess  neuroprotective

Interestingly, 

both  these  compounds  (Weinreb  et  al.,  2004a; 
Bar-Am  et  al.,  2005;  Youdim  et  al.,  2005b;  Zheng 
et  al.,  2005a). 
    The  selectivity  of  rasagiline  as  an  MAO-B  in-
hibitor  compared  with  TVP-1022,  is  thought  to  be 
associated  with  the  ability  of  rasagiline  to  enter  the 
catalytic  site  gorge  of  MAO-B.  On  the  other  hand, 
the  configuration  of  the  S-isomer  imparts  a  highly 
restrictive  conformation  on  the  enzyme-ligand  com-
plex,  which  prevents  the  molecule  from  entering  the 
catalytic  site,  precluding  it  from  acting  as  a  me-
chanism-based 
the  neuro-
protective  activity  associated  with  these  compounds 
has  now  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  the 
ability  of  propargylamine  (Weinreb  et  al.,  2004a; 
Bar-Am  et  al.,  2005) 
to  protect  mitochondrial 
viability  by  activation  of  Bcl-2  and  protein  kinase  C 
(PKC)α  and  ε,  and  by  down  regulating  pro- 
apoptotic  FAS  and  Bax,  and  PKCδ  and  -γ 
(Youdim  et  al.,  2005a).  Additionally,  these  drugs 
induce  the  release  of  the  soluble  neuroprotective- 
neurotrophic  form  of  the  amyloid  precursor  protein 
α  (sAPPα)  through  a  PCK-MAP  mediated  ac-
tivation  of  α-secretase  (Youdim  and  Buccafusco, 
2005b). 
    The  identification  of  the  propargylamine  moiety  as 
a  key  element  that  confers  neuroprotective  activity 
and,  in  cases  such  as  rasagiline  and  selegiline, 
also  MAO  inhibitory  activity,  led  to  the  development 
of  AchE  inhibitors  such  as  ladostigil  (TV3326,  now 

the 

of  salmeterol  (a  β2-adrenergic  agonist)  and  flu-
ticasone  (a  glucocorticoid  steroid)  in  asthma,  has 
led  to  the  combination  of  these  two  medications  in

).  Also,  the  combination  (in  Vytorin
of  simvastatin  (an  HMG-CoA  reductase  inhibitor) 
and  ezetimibe  (an  inhibitor  of  dietary  cholesterol 
uptake)  is  used  to  treat  hyperlipidemia  (Zimmer-
mann  et  al.,  2007).  The  major  dilemma  encountered 
in  a  polypharmaceutical  approach,  is  a  significant 
chance  increase  in  side  effects,  which  may  be 
reduced  statistically  with 
the  use  of  only  one 
compound.  The  recent  appearance  on  the  market 
of  drugs  that  display  two  mechanisms  to  treat  a 
particular  disease  has  been  a  clear  move  in  the 
latter  paradigm.  One  example, 
direction  of 
Ⓡ
duloxetine  (Cymbalta
),  used  in  the  treatment  of 
depression,  inhibits  both  serotonin  and  norepine-
pherine  uptake  in  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS) 
(Wong  et  al.,  1988;  KiharaIkeda,  1995;  Goldstein  et 
al.,  2002).  The  introduction  of  drugs  such  as  du-
loxetine  indicates  the  clinical  feasibility  of  designing 
multi-functional  ligands  to  treat  CNS  disorders  with 
complex  disease  pathways. 
    In  this  review,  we  will  consider  examples  of 
compounds  with  multi-functional  neuroprotective- 
neurorescue  (Table  1  for  definitions)  properties  that 
may  have  promise  in  the  treatment  of  PD  and 
similar  approaches  have  been  made  for  multimodal 
drugs  for  AD  (Youdim  et  al.,  2006;  Zheng  et  al., 
2009),  but  for  the  present  discussion  we  shall  focus 
on  PD  only.  Some  of  the  compounds  discussed 
were  discovered  through  serendipity  while  others 
were  the  products  of  active  drug  design  projects. 

Rasagiline

    Rasagiline  is  a  newly  approved  compound  for  the 
treatment  of  PD  (Fig.  2;  Schapira  et  al.,  2005).

(N-propargyl-1S-aminoindan),  is  more  than  a  1,000 
times  less  potent  as  an  MAO  inhibitor  than  ra-
sagiline,  but  still  retains  neuroprotective  activity,

(AD)/anti-PD/antidepressant  drug  (Sterling  et  al., 
2002;  Weinstock  et  al.,  2002;  Youdim  et  al.,  2005a; 
Youdim  and  Buccafusco,  2005b).  Ladostigil  (Fig.  3) 
is  a  dual  acetylcholine-butyrylcholine-esterase,  and 
brain-selective  MAO-A/B  inhibitor  in  vivo,  designed 
by  combining  the  carbamate  cholinesterase  inhibi-
tory  moiety  found  in  the  rivastigmine  molecule,  with 
the  pharmacophore  of  rasagiline  and  TVP1022  both 
of  which  possess  the  propargylamine  moiety.  La-
dostigil  has  been  shown  to  have  antidepressant 
activity  due  to  its  ability  to  inhibit  MAO-A  in  the 
raphe  nucleus,  striatum,  hippocampus,  and  hypo-
thalamus,  and  to  raise  brain  levels  of  DA,  no-

noradrenergic,  and  serotonergic  pathways.  In  PD, 
accumulation  of  iron  is  found  inside  some  me-
lanin-containing  DA-ergic  neurons  and  inside  am-
yloid  plaques  and  neurofibrillary  tangles  associated 
with  PD  dementia  (Zecca  et  al.,  2004).  It  has  been 
suggested  that  iron  accumulation  may  contribute  to 
the  oxidative  stress-induced  apoptosis  reported  in 
both  PD  and  PD  dementia  (Zecca  et  al.,  2004; 
Youdim  et  al.,  2005b).  Such  oxidative  stress  may 
result 
increased  glial  monoamine  oxidase 
(MAO)  activity  leading  to  exacerbated  hydrogen 
peroxide  production 
that  can  generate  reactive 
hydroxyl  radical 
through  Fenton  chemistry  with 
intracellular  ferrous  iron.  Iron  chelators  such  as 
desferoxamine,  clioquinol  and  VK-28  have  been 
shown  to  have  neuroprotective  activity  in  animal 
models  of  AD  and  PD  (Zecca  et  al.,  2004). 
    Based  on  this  proposal,  Zheng  et  al.  (2005b) 
developed  neuroprotective  compounds  with  dual 
iron  chelating  and  MAO-B  inhibitory  activity.  These 
authors  combined  the  antioxidant  chelator  moiety 
present  in  an  8-hydroxyquinoline  derivative  of  the 
neuroprotective  brain-permeable  iron  chelator  VK- 
28,  with  the  propargylamine  moiety  (found  in  com-
pounds  such  as  rasagiline  and  selegiline,  as  stated

M30,  such  as  M30C-N  and  into  HLA-20  to  give 
HLA-20A  and  have  even  added 
the  glutamate 
antagonist,  memantine,  which  is  presently  in  the 
clinical  use.  These  compounds  HLA-20A  (Fig.  6) 
and  M30C-N  (Fig.  7)  have  been  shown  to  have 
potent  ChE  I  and  MAO-A  and  B  inhibitory  activity 
and  possess  similar  neuroprotective  activity  to  those 
of 
their  parent  compounds,  HLA-20  and  M30 
(Zheng  et  al.,  2009).
    The  accumulation  of  iron  at  sites  where  neurons 
degenerate  in  PD,  is  thought  to  be  a  major  event 
that  is  linked  to  the  neurodegenerative  process 
(Zecca  et  al.,  2004).  The  novel  non-toxic  lipophilic 
(and  therefore  brain-permeable)  iron  chelator  VK- 
28,  and  its  multi-functional  derivative,  M30  (both  of 
which  possess 
inhibitory  and  neuro-
rasagiline),  offer 
protective  propargyl  moiety  of 
potential 
for  PD.  M30  at-
tenuates  apoptotic  events  in  SH-SY5Y  neurobla-
stoma  cells 
in  a  serum  deprivation  model  via 
multiple  protection  mechanisms,  including  1)  re-
duction  of  the  pro-apoptotic  proteins,  Bad  and  Bax; 
2)  reduction  of  apoptosis-associated  Ser139-pho-
sphorylated  H2A.X;  3)  induction  of  the  anti-apoptotic 
protein,  Bcl-2  and  4)  inhibition  of  the  cleavage  and 
activation  of  caspase-3.  M30  also  promotes  mor-
phological  changes,  resulting 
in  axonal  growth- 
associated  protein-43  (GAP-43),  which  is  implicated 
in  neuronal  differentiation.  The  compound  markedly

compound  for  further  studies  having  selectivity  for 
MAO-B  with  an  IC50  value  in  the  region  of  110μM 
(Fig.  4;  ＞200μM  for  MAO-A),  as  well  as  acting  as 
a 
related 
compound  designated  M30,  unlike  HLA20  was 
found  in  vitro,  to  be  a  highly  potent  MAO-A  and  B 
inhibitor  with  brain  selectivity  for  these  enzymes  in 
vivo,  in  addition  to  possessing  iron  chelating  pro-
perties  similar  to  desferoxamine  (Gal  et  al.,  2005; 
Zheng  et  al.,  2005a;  2005b).  M30  behaves  similarly 
to  other  propargylamine  MAO  inhibitors  by  acting  as 
a  suicide-  or  mechanism-based  inhibitor  after  being 
identified  and  processed  as  a  substrate  by  the 
enzyme  and  imparts  similar  neuroprotective  pro-
perties  as  those  found  in  rasagiline  and  ladostigil 
(Fig.  5).  M30  protects  against  MPTP  and  kainate 
neurotoxicity  in  mice  by  virtue  of  both  its  MAO 
inhibitory  and  iron  chelating/radical  scavenging  pro-
perties  in  these  two  animal  models  of  neurode-
generation.  It  has  recently  been  shown  to  have 
dopaminergic  neurorestorative  activity  in  post  treat-
ment  with  MPTP  (Gal  et  al.,  2009)  and  lactacystin 
(Zhu  et  al.,  2007)  models  of  PD.  The  neurogenic 
activity  of  M30  and  HLA-20  has  been  attributed  to 
the  inhibition  of  iron  dependent  prolyl-4-hydroxylase, 
via  chelation  of  iron  and  activation  of  HIF  (hypoxia 
inducing  factor)  that  regulates  transcription  of  a 
series  of  neurotropins  such  as  BDNF,  GDNF, 
erythropoietin  and  VEGF.  The  Consequence  of  HIF 
activation

results  in  inhibition  of  cyclin  D1  that  causes  cell 
arrest  differentiation  into  neurons  as  seen  in  the 
neurorestorative  activity  of  M30  in  the  two  models 
of  PD  (Zhu  et  al.,  2007;  Gal  et  al.,  2009;  Ku-

Monoamine  oxidase  inhibition  by  A2Areceptor 
antagonists

    In  PD,  a  dual  mechanism  that  includes  inhibition 
of  MAO-B,  as  well  as  adenosine  A2A  receptor 
blockade  offer  a  novel  therapeutic  approach  to 

reduces  the  levels  of  cellular  holo-APP,  the  β- 
C-terminal  fragment  (β-CTF),  and  levels  of  amy-
loidogenic  Aβ peptide  in  the  medium  of  SH-SY5Y 
and  CHO  cells  stably  transfected  with  the  APP 
“Swedish”  mutation.  In  addition,  levels  of  the  non- 
amyloidogenic  sAPPα in  cell  medium,  as  well  as 
levels  of  α-CTF  in  cell  lysate  were  found  to  be 
elevated.  These  results  are  consistent  with  the 
presence  of  an  iron-responsive  element  (IRE)  in  the 
5'-untranslated  region  (5'UTR)  of  APP  and  de-
monstrate

holo-APP  expression  and  Aβ  peptide  secretion.

earlier,  MAO-B  plays  a  role  in  the  catabolism  of

repinephrine,

mation  which  contributes  to  oxidative  stress  and 
neuronal  cell  death  (Riederer  et  al.,  2004).  Levels 
of  MAO-B  are  found  to  be  increased  in  older 
patients  (Saura  et  al.,  1994;  1997;  Mahy  et  al., 
2000)  which  has  led  to  the  rationale  for  the  use  of 
drugs  such  as  selegiline  (deprenyl)  and  lazabemide, 
(Sramek  and  Cutler,  1999)  and  the  design  of  drugs 
such  as  ladostigil,  (Youdim  and  Buccafusco,  2005b) 
as  described  before.
    Caffeine,  a  non-selective  adenosine  receptor  an-
tagonist,  is  under  some  scrutiny  as  a  potential  drug 
to  counteract  age-related  cognitive  decline  (Fig.  8). 
Work  in  this  regard  is  supported  by  evidence  that 
critical  changes 
in  adenosine-related  neurotrans-
mission  occur  with  aging  and  may  be  counteracted 
by  adenosine  receptor  antagonists  (Maiade  and 
Mendonca,  2002;  Dall'Igna  et  al.,  2003;  Prediger  et 
al.,  2005).  Caffeine,  in  fact,  has  been  suggested  to 
protect  against  β-amyloid  neurotoxicity,  (Dall'Igna 
et  al.,  2003)  while  acute  treatment  with  caffeine 
and  the  A2A  receptor  antagonist  ZM241385  was 
recently  found  to  reverse  age-  related  olfactory 
deficits  and  memory  decline  in  rats  (Prediger  et  al., 
2005)  clearly  suggesting  involvement  of  A2A,  but  not 
A1  receptors,  in  cognitive  decline  and  possibly, 
neurodegenerative  processes.  Evidence  such  as  the 
preceding,  and  other  evidence  for  neuroprotection

(E)-8-styryl- 
xanthinyl  derived  adenosine  A2A  receptor  anta-
gonists  for  inhibition  also  of  brain  MAO-B.  Included 
in 
these  studies  were  KW-6002,  a  potent  A2A 
receptor  antagonist  (Ki  of  2.2  nM)  which  is  un-
dergoing  clinical  trials  for  PD,  and  (E)-8-(3-chlo-
rostyryl)-caffeine  (CSC;  Fig.  8),  which  has  been 
shown  to  be  neuroprotective  in  the  MPTP  par-
kinsonian  mouse  model  (Chen  et  al.,  2002).  All  of 
the  compounds  tested  in  the  studies  by  Petzer  et 
al.  (Petzer  et  al.,  2003)  showed  MAO-B  inhibition  in 
the  low  micromolar  to  high  nanomolar  range,  with 
the  Ki  of  KW-6002  at  21μM,  and  that  of  CSC  at 
0.1μM.  These  results  clearly  suggest 
the 
neuroprotective  properties  of  KW-6002  and  CSC 
may  in  part  be  due  to  MAO-B  inhibition,  in  sy-

NMDA  antagonism  by  calcium  channel  blockers
    The  divalent  calcium  cation  plays  an  important 
role  in  neuronal  cell  death  (Lipton,  1999;  Horn  and 
Limburg,  2000;  Kemp  and  McKernan,  2002;  Ov-
biagele  et  al.,  2003).  One  of  the  receptors  activated 
by  glutamate  (together  with  its  co-agonist  glycine), 
the  NMDA  receptor,  is  a  major  conduit  for  the  influx 
of  calcium  ions  into  cells  under  excitotoxic  con-
ditions.  The  prevention  of  such  excessive  influx  of 
calcium  (known  as  excitotoxicity)  therefore  remains 
a  major  drug  target  in  the  design  of  neuroprotective 
agents.  Excess  accumulation  of  calcium  in  neuronal 
cells  rapidly  leads  to  cell  death  through  a  variety  of 
mechanisms  including  activation  of  proteases,  nu-
cleases,  phospholipases,  nitric  oxide  synthase 
(NOS),  and  other  degradative  enzymes  that  not 
only  lead  to  activation  of  death  cascades,  but  also

to 
formation  (Lipton,  1999).  NMDA 
receptor  antagonists  such  as  dizocilpine  (MK-801) 
and  memantine  may  possess  a  dual  mechanism  by 
which  neuronal  cells  are  protected,  both  by  direct 
blockade  of  the  NMDA  receptor  and  by  attenuating 
TNFα-induced  potentiation  of  glutamate 
toxicity 
(Zou  and  Crews,  2005).
    Brain  injury  after  ischemic  stroke  also  triggers  a 
release  of  glutamate-associated  excitotoxic  events, 
and 
impairment  and 
dementia  have  both  been  reported  to  be  elevated 
after  cerebral  stroke,  especially 
the  elderly 
(KalariaBallard,  2001).  Up  to  25%  of  stroke  patients 
exhibit  symptoms  of  dementia,  including  symptoms 
reminiscent  of  PD  dementia  (van  Kooten  and 
Koudstaal,  1998).  Stroke  is  the  third  leading  cause 
of  death  in  the  United  States  (Ovbiagele  et  al., 
2003)  and  there  is  a  definitive  need  to  develop 
drugs  that  can  protect  or  save  neurons  after  an 
ischemic  incident  since,  to  date,  no  effective  treat-
ment  has  been  developed  to  prevent  neuronal  cells 
from  dying  during  stroke  conditions  (Horn  and 
Limburg,  2000).
    Several  studies  have  shown  that  NMDA  receptor 
antagonists,  such  as  dizocilpine  (MK-801)  and  the

polycyclic  cage  amine  memantine,  display  neuro-
protective  effects  in  experiments  using  ischemia 
paradigms  in  neurons  (Gorgulu  et  al.,  2000;  Horn 
and  Limburg,  2000;  Gerriets  et  al.,  2003;  Richard 
Green  et  al.,  2003).  An  alternative  pathway  for 
calcium  to  enter  into  neuronal  cells  is  through 
voltage-gated  ion  channels,  such  as  L-type  calcium 
channels.  Animal  experiments  with  nimodipine  have 
suggested  that  calcium  channel  antagonists  may  be 
neuroprotective  in  ischemia  by  antagonizing  the 
influx  of  calcium  into  neuronal  cells  (Horn  and 
Limburg,  2000).  The  importance  of  calcium  overload 
during  cell  death,  suggests  that  a  dual  calcium 
channel  and  NMDA  receptor  antagonist  might  be 
useful  as  a  neuroprotective  drug  in  stroke  and  other 
neurodegenerative  disease  such  as  idiopathic  PD, 
where  it  has  been  suggested  that  brain-permeable 
L-type  calcium  channel  blockers  may  have  a  sa-
lutary  effect  on  the  disease. 
    NGP1-01  (8-benzylamino-8,11-oxapentacyclounde-
cane)  is  a  polycyclic  cage  amine  derived  from  the 
reductive  amination  of  benzylamine  and  Cookson's 
“bird  cage”  diketone  of  which  the  biology  was  first 
described  by  Van  der  Schyf  (Van  der  Schyf  et  al., 
1986)  (Fig.  10).  The  L-type  calcium  channel  block-

Neuroprotective  and  Neurorestorative  Drugs 9

mg/kg)  reduced  choline  release  by  40%.  These 
results  demonstrate  that  NGP1-01  simultaneously 
blocks  both  major  neuronal  calcium  channels  and  is 
brain-permeable  after  peripheral  administration.  This 
dual  mechanism  of  modulating  calcium  entry  into 
neuronal  cells  might  suggest  that  NGP1-01  may 
have  utility  as  a  neuroprotective  agent  in  PD,  stroke 
and  other  neurodegenerative  diseases,  especially  in 
patients  with  comorbidity  among  these  diseases. 
This  promise  of  neuroprotection  has  recently  been 
partly  confirmed  in  in  vivo  studies  using  the  middle 
cerebral  artery  occlusion  (MCAO)  mouse  model  of 
stroke,  wherein  it  was  shown  that  NGP1-01,  ad-
ministered  30  minutes  before  MCAO,  afforded  sub-
stantial  protection  against  cerebral  ischemia-induced 
brain  lesioning,  as  well  as  brain  swelling  measured 
24  hours  after  MCAO  (Mdzinarishvili  et  al.,  2005). 
    Another  role  assigned  to  cage  amines  such  as 
NGP1-01  in  PD  therapy  is  the  ability  of  these 
compounds 
into  nerve 
terminals  (Fig.  10).  Compounds  that  are  able  to 
block  the  DA  transporter  (DAT)  have  been  sug-
gested  to  be  more  useful  in  treating  the  motor 
symptoms  in  PD,  as  opposed  to  norepinephrine  and 
serotonin  re-uptake  inhibitors  (Hansard  et  al.,  2002). 
Additionally,  compounds  with  the  ability  to  block 
DAT,  may  also  have  neuroprotective  activity  (Kirby 
et  al.,  2002).  NGP1-01  was  recently  shown  to  block 
DA  re-uptake  in  murine  synaptosomes  with  an 
IC50  of  57μM.  One  of  NGP1-01’s  derivatives,  a 
phenylethylamine  derivative,  was  even  more  potent 
with  an  IC50  of  23μM  (Geldenhuys  et  al.,  2004). 
The  latter  compound  was  also  found  to  be  neu-
roprotective  in  the  MPTP-parkinsonian  mouse  mo-
del,  affording  protection  against  a  single  35  mg/kg 
(ip)  dose  of  1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyri-
dine  (MPTP)  (Geldenhuys  et  al.,  2003).

Green  tea  polyphenols

    Polyphenols  are  natural  products  present  in  be-
verages  such  as  red  wine  and  tea  (Weinreb  et  al., 
2004b).  One  of  the  classes  of  polyphenols  which 
are  pharmaceutically  interesting  is  the  flavenoids 
(Fig.  11).  These  compounds  are  characterized  by 
an  aromatic  ring  which  is  condensed  to  a  he-
terocyclic  ring  and  attached  to  a  second  aromatic 
ring.  An  innovative  therapeutic  approach  could  be 
the  use  of  natural  plant  polyphenol 
flavonoids, 

Fig.  10.  Chemical  structures  of  NGP-01  and  its  derivatives.

ing  activity  of  NGP1-01  was  investigated  utilizing 
electrophysiological  experiments  in  isolated  guinea- 
pig  papillary  muscle  and  sheep  Purkinje  fibers  (Van 
der  Schyf  et  al.,  1986).  The  structural  similarity  of 
NGP1-01  to  another  polycyclic  cage  amine  and 
NMDA  receptor  antagonist,  memantine,  led  to  the 
evaluation  of  NGP1-01  for  potential  NMDA  receptor 
antagonism.  Memantine  is  an  uncompetitive  NMDA 
receptor  antagonist  which  is  used  clinically  to  treat 
AD,  but  has  also  been  used  for  PD  in  Germany 
(Parsons  et  al.,  1999;  Rogawski  and  Wenk,  2003; 
Plosker  and  Lyseng-Williamson,  2005).  Its  favorable 
fast  on-off  binding  kinetics  gives  this  compound  an 
improved  side  effect  profile  compared  with  other 
NMDA  antagonists  such  as  MK-801  (Parsons  et  al., 
1999).  NGP1-01  was  shown  to  also  be  an  un-
competitive  NMDA  antagonist  in  murine  whole  brain 
synaptoneurosomes  and  blocked  NMDA-mediated 
45Ca2＋
  uptake  with  an  IC50  of  2.98μM  (Geldenhuys 
et  al.,  2007). 
    In  a  recent  paper  Kiewert  et  al.  (2006)  showed 
that  NGP1-01  (at  1μM)  inhibited  depolarization- 
induced  calcium  influx  by  78%  in  cortical  neurons 
preloaded  with  fura-2  AM,  with  a  potency  similar  to 
that  of  nimodipine,  while  simultaneously  inhibiting 
NMDA-induced  (1  mM)  calcium  influx  by  52%,  only 
slightly  less  potent  than  memantine.  Using  in  vivo- 
microdialysis,  choline  release  was  monitored  during 
NMDA  infusion  as  a  measure  of  excitotoxic  mem-
brane  breakdown.  Intraperitoneal  injection  of  NGP1- 
01  (40  mg/kg)  reduced  NMDA-induced  membrane 
breakdown  by  31%  (p＜0.01)  while  memantine  (10

1996;  Hider  et  al.,  2001;  Joseph  et  al.,  2005).
    These  compounds  and  their  actions  have  been 
extensively  reviewed  (Mandel  et  al.,  2005).  In  par-
ticular,  the  major  constituent  of  green  tea  catechin 
extract  (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate  (EGCG;  Fig.  11) 
plays  a  major  role  in  the  prevention  of  neuro-
degeneration  in  a  variety  of  cellular  and  animal 
models  of  neurodegenerative  diseases  (Mandel  et 
al.,  2006).  This  effect  appears  to  be  mediated 
through  multiple  pathways, 
the  partici-
pation  of  the  pro-survival  PKC  and  extracellular 
mitogen-activated  protein  kinase  (MAPK)  signaling 
and  the  promotion  of  neurite  outgrowth  (Rezni-

studies  have  shown  that  prolonged  administration  of 
EGCG  to  mice  induced  a  significant  reduction  in

(Levites  et  al.,  2003)  and  in  cerebral  Aβ  levels

DISCUSSION

    PD  and  AD  are  complex  diseases  with  multiple 
pathways  which  contribute  to  its  etiology  and  finally 
cell  death  of  DA-ergic,  cholinergic  and  other  neu-
rons.  To  address  this  multiplicity,  compounds  that 
target  more  than  one  drug  target  in  the  cell  death 
cascades  are  now  investigated  and  designed.  The 
feasibility  of  moving  these  drugs  to  market  has 
been  shown  through  the  success  of  rasagiline, 
which  has  been  shown  to  have  neuroprotective 
activity  and  has  made  it  to  the  market  as  a  PD 
therapeutic  (Olanow  et  al.,  2009).  The  development 
of  multimodal  drugs 
limited  to  neurode-
generative  disease,  but  rather 
that  similar  ap-
proaches  are  under  way  with  other  complex  di-
sease  such  as  cancer,  AIDS,  depressive  illness, 
schizophrenia  and  possibly  cardiovascular  disorders 
(Youdim  and  Van  der  Schyf,  2009).
