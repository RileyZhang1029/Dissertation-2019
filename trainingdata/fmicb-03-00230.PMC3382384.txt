Rickettsiae are obligate intracellular parasitic bacteria that cause febrile exanthematous
illnesses such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Mediterranean spotted fever, epidemic,
and murine typhus, etc. Although the vector ranges of each Rickettsia species are rather
restricted; i.e., ticks belonging to Arachnida and lice and ﬂeas belonging to Insecta usually
act as vectors for spotted fever group (SFG) and typhus group (TG) rickettsiae, respec-
tively, it would be interesting to elucidate the mechanisms controlling the vector tropism
of rickettsiae. This review discusses the factors determining the vector tropism of rick-
ettsiae. In brief, the vector tropism of rickettsiae species is basically consistent with their
tropism toward cultured tick and insect cells. The mechanisms responsible for rickettsiae
pathogenicity are also described. Recently, genomic analyses of rickettsiae have revealed
that they possess several genes that are homologous to those affecting the pathogenic-
ity of other bacteria. Analyses comparing the genomes of pathogenic and non-pathogenic
strains of rickettsiae have detected many factors that are related to rickettsial pathogenicity.
It is also known that a reduction in the rickettsial genome has occurred during the course
of its evolution. Interestingly, Rickettsia species with small genomes, such as Rickettsia
prowazekii, are more pathogenic to humans than those with larger genomes. This review
also examines the growth kinetics of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species of SFG rick-
ettsiae (SFGR) in mammalian cells. The growth of non-pathogenic species is restricted in
these cells, which is mediated, at least in part, by autophagy. The superinfection of non-
pathogenic rickettsiae-infected cells with pathogenic rickettsiae results in an elevated yield
of the non-pathogenic rickettsiae and the growth of the pathogenic rickettsiae. Autophagy
is restricted in these cells. These results are discussed in this review.

INTRODUCTION
Rickettsioses in the broad sense are caused by a variety of
gram-negative bacteria from the Rickettsia, Orientia, Ehrlichia,
Anaplasma, or Neorickettsia genera. Rickettsia are now further
classiﬁed into the typhus group (TG) and spotted fever group
(SFG; Table 1), although Orientia used to belong to the scrub
TG of Rickettsia (Tamura et al., 1995; Fournier et al., 2005).
Coxiella, the causative agent of Q fever, used to be classiﬁed
into the Rickettsiales order but now belongs to the Legionellales
order (Weisburg et al., 1989). As Rickettsia are obligate intra-
cellular parasites, many of the mechanisms involved in their
attachment and internalization into host cells are shared by
viruses.

Rickettsiae cause febrile exanthematous illnesses, such as spot-
ted fever, epidemic, and murine typhus, etc. (Dyer et al., 1931;
Zinsser and Castaneda, 1933). Until nearly two decades ago, only
ﬁve species of SFG rickettsiae (SFGR), R. rickettsii, R. conorii,
R. sibilica, R. australis, and R. akari, which are responsible for
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Wolbach, 1919), Mediterranean
spotted fever or Boutonneuse fever (Brumpt, 1932), North Asian
tick typhus or Siberian tick typhus (Shmatikov and Velik, 1939),
Queensland tick typhus (Plotz et al., 1946), and Rickettsialpox
(Huebner et al., 1946), respectively, were known to be patho-
genic. However, since the isolation and identiﬁcation of a new

SFGR species, R. japonica, from Japanese patients with a form
of SFG rickettsiosis known as Japanese spotted fever or Oriental
spotted fever (Uchida et al., 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992; Uchiyama
and Uchida, 1988; Uchiyama et al., 1991), many pathogenic SFGR
species have been newly isolated and identiﬁed, and some of the
previously identiﬁed SFGR species have now been recognized as
pathogenic (Table 1; Beati and Raoult, 1993; Beati et al., 1993,
1997; Kelly et al., 1996; Raoult et al., 1997; Stenos et al., 1998;
Fournier et al., 2003, 2005; Mediannikov et al., 2004; Paddock
et al., 2004). More recently, R. bellii was isolated from amebas,
and it was suggested that it should be classiﬁed into the ances-
tral group (AG), which contains Rickettsia species that have been
demonstrated by phylogenetic analyses to have the oldest genomic
features among the previously isolated and identiﬁed Rickettsia
species (Philip et al., 1983; Stohard et al., 1994; Gillespie et al.,
2012). R. bellii displays weaker pathogenicity in experimental
animals than R. conorii, although its pathogenicity in humans
remains unknown (Ogata et al., 2006). Although the mechanism
by which rickettsiae cause disease has not been well established,
it is thought that rickettsial pathogenicity involves the inﬁltration
of cells into the vascular environment, hemorrhaging, and throm-
bosis due to the degeneration of endothelial vein cells caused by
the growth of the rickettsiae. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the
outer membranes of rickettsiae are also thought to participate in

the eruption, pyrexia, and endotoxin shock observed during the
course of rickettsial infection.

It is worth noting that the vector ranges of each rickettsial
species are rather restricted; i.e., the vectors for SFGR species are
usually ticks (except those for R. akari and R. felis, which are mites
and ﬂeas, respectively) belonging to Arachnida. On the other hand,
those for TGR species are lice and ﬂeas, which belong to Insecta
(Table 1; Higgins et al., 1996). R. felis carries its pRF genes on a
plasmid so it does not fully meet the criteria for the SFG or TG.
Rather, this indicates that R. felis has participated in horizontal
gene transfer involving the AG and might be better classiﬁed into
a transitional group along with R. akari, which displays both SFG
and TG characteristics (Gillespie et al., 2007, 2012). This plas-
mid might have been incorporated into the chromosomes of the
other Rickettsia during the course of their evolution (Gillespie
et al., 2007). The mechanisms responsible for the vector tropism
of rickettsiae have not been studied in detail.

TROPISM OF RICKETTSIAE TOWARD ARTHROPOD VECTORS
AND CULTURED CELLS
Although the relationships between rickettsiae and their vectors
are relatively ﬁxed, the mechanisms responsible for the tropism
of rickettsiae toward arthropod vectors have not been elucidated.
Studies using cell lines derived from arthropods are indispens-
able for clarifying these mechanisms. In studies using insect cells,
Uchiyama reported that the growth of some SFGR species, R.
japonica, and R. montanensis, was restricted in the NIAS-AeAl-
2 (AeAl2) insect cell line, which is derived from Aedes albopictus,
even though SFGR species have been demonstrated to be capable

of adhering to and invading these cells (Figures 1–3; Mitsuhashi,
1981; Mizuki et al., 1999; Noda et al., 2002; Uchiyama, 2005).
Scanning and transmission electron microscopy conﬁrmed these
results (Figure 3; Uchiyama, 2006). Rickettsiae seem to begin their
invasion of AeAl2 cells immediately after adhering to them. The
superinfection of SFGR-infected AeAl2 cells with a TGR species
on day three of infection resulted in the growth of the TGR species
but not the SFGR species. Furthermore, the SFGR-infected AeAl2
cells suffered rapid cell death; however, as no DNA fragmenta-
tion, lobed nuclei, or peripheral chromosome condensation were
observed, the growth inhibition of these cells was possibly due
to their non-apoptotic necrotic cell death. Concerning this issue,
induced cell death (subsequently renamed programmed necro-
sis), which is one of the candidates for the mechanism responsible
for growth inhibition, has been found to act in opposition to anti-
apoptotic factors (Laster et al., 1988; Holler et al., 2000; Chan et al.,
2003; Cho et al., 2009; He et al., 2009). For example, cells infected
with Cowpox virus cause tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced
programmed necrosis, which is opposed by the anti-apoptosis fac-
tor CrmA (Chan et al., 2003). When T cells or ﬁbroblastic cells are
infected with the Vaccinia virus, apoptosis is inhibited by the anti-
apoptotic factor B13R/Spi2; however, TNF-induced programmed
necrosis can also occur (Cho et al., 2009). Thus, programmed
necrosis might occur when AeAl2 cells are infected with SFGR.
Contrary to our results, a previous report found that some non-
pathogenic SFGR species, R. montanensis, and R. peacockii, were
able to grow in two mosquito cell lines (the A. albopictus cell line
Aa23 and the Anopheles gambiae cell line Sua5B; Sakamoto and
Azad, 2007). The reason for this discrepancy is poorly understood;

Tropism and pathogenicity of rickettsiae

FIGURE 1 | Basic tropism of rickettsiae toward cultured cells. The
growth of SFGR and TGR was monitored in cells derived from ticks,
insects, and mammals. SFGR grew well in tick cells, while TGR grew
well in insect cells. However, the growth of SFGR was restricted in

insect cells and that of TGR was restricted in tick cells. Both groups of
pathogenic rickettsiae grew well in mammalian cells. Both groups of
rickettsiae were conﬁrmed to be capable of adhering to all of the tested
cells.

however, the abovementioned growth was only detected by FISH
and PCR, rather than in an infective assay. Another report found
that the transcription of spoT gene paralogs was suppressed dur-
ing the maintenance of R. conorii in A. albopictus (C6/36) cells at
10˚C for 38 days. Shifting the temperature to 37ºC resulted in a
rapid upregulation of spoT1 gene expression (Rovery et al., 2005).
Although R. conorii were conﬁrmed to be able to survive in the
cells at low temperature, their growth was not directly assayed after
the temperature was increased.

As for studies using tick cell lines, several reports have demon-
strated the growth of SFGR species in cells derived from ticks
(Policastro et al., 1997; Munderloh et al., 1998). In our study
(Uchiyama et al., 2009), the DALBE3 cell line from Dermacen-
tor albipictus and the ISE6 cell line from Ixodes scapularis were
inoculated with R. japonica and R. conorii as SFGR species and
R. prowazekii and R. typhi as TGR species. The SFGR grew well
in these tick cells as well as in Vero, HeLa, and ECV304 mam-
malian cells (Figures 1 and 2). On the contrary, the growth of
TGR was restricted in these tick cells, even though they successfully
adhered to the cells, which was also true for other combinations of
rickettsiae and host cells. These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by trans-
mission electron microscopy. Rickettsiae were also found to be able
to escape into the cytoplasm from phagosomes after being engulfed
by the tick cells. Thus, the observed growth restriction occurred
after these steps, although the precise mechanism responsible for
it is yet to be elucidated. These results from studies using various
combinations of SFGR or TGR and tick or insect cells suggest that
the host vector tropism of rickettsiae is at least partially based on
host cellular tropism (Figure 1).

PATHOGENICITY OF RICKETTSIAE
As shown in Table 1, many rickettsial species have displayed evi-
dence of being pathogenic to humans. On the other hand, many
other species have not displayed any evidence of being patho-
genic to humans, some of which might be weakly pathogenic.
To date, various putative factors that might be associated with the

pathogenicity of rickettsiae have been proposed; however, the mol-
ecular basis for the pathogenicity of rickettsiae is yet to be precisely
established.

It is reasonable to think that the degree of growth of Rickettsia
in human blood vessels; i.e., endothelial cells (EC), primarily deter-
mines the severity of their effects on the host, with the exception
of R. akari, the causative agent of Rickettsialpox, which prin-
cipally targets macrophages (Walker et al., 2007). Thus, every
step of the growth of rickettsiae in host cells could affect their
pathogenicity. The events involved in host cell infection by rick-
ettsiae are summarized in Figure 4. The ﬁrst steps involve the
adherence of the rickettsiae to host cells and their subsequent
invasion of these cells, since Rickettsia are obligate intracellu-
lar parasitic bacteria. Internalization occurs within minutes, and
rickettsiae escape from phagosomes into the cytoplasm via the
phospholipase activities of hemolysin C (TlyC) and phospholi-
pase D (Pld; Teysseire et al., 1995; Whitworth et al., 2005). It
has been clariﬁed that among the 17 subfamilies of Sca auto-
transporter proteins, rOmpA (=Sca0), and rOmpB (=Sca5) are
involved in host cell adherence and invasion by rickettsiae. rOmpA
is one of the major surface antigen proteins of SFGR, and treat-
ment with the antibody against rOmpA or immunization with
recombinant rOmpA protected animal models against infection
by rickettsiae (Anacker et al., 1985, 1987; McDonald et al., 1987;
Li et al., 1988; McDonald et al., 1988; Vishwanath et al., 1990;
Sumner et al., 1995; Crocquet-Valdes et al., 2001). The role of
rOmpA in the adherence of rickettsiae to host cells has also been
examined using cultured cells (Li and Walker, 1998). However, TG
rickettsiae do not possess rOmpA, although a remnant (369 bp)
of its ORF (6,063 bp) still exists in the equivalent region in R.
prowazekii. rOmpB, which is the only major surface antigen pro-
tein common to the genus Rickettsia, was also conﬁrmed to play
roles in host cell adherence and invasion by rickettsiae in studies
using Escherichia coli expressing recombinant R. japonica rOmpB
on their surface (Uchiyama, 1999; Uchiyama et al., 2006; Chan
et al., 2009). rOmpB is well conserved among the Rickettsia genus

including SFGR and TGR, e.g., the rOmpB amino acid sequences
of R. prowazekii and R. conorii share 70% homology, which might
reﬂect the importance of the molecule for rickettsial growth (Carl
et al., 1990; Gilmore et al., 1991; Hahn et al., 1993). rOmpB might
also play other roles, e.g., in the maintenance of the structure of
the bacteria or as a molecular sieve, etc. rOmpB associates with
Ku70 on the plasma membrane (Martinez et al., 2005), and this
interaction is sufﬁcient to mediate the rickettsial invasion of non-
phagocytic host cells (Chan et al., 2009). Clathrin and caveolin-
2-dependent endocytosis are responsible for the internalization
of rickettsiae. The recruitment of c-Cbl, a ubiquitin ligase, to the
entry site is also required for the ubiquitination of Ku70 (Martinez
et al., 2005). R. conorii enters non-phagocytic cells via an Arp2/3

complex-dependent pathway (Martinez and Cossart, 2004). Path-
ways involving Cdc42, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, c-Src, cortactin,
and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins activate Arp2/3, resulting
in localized actin rearrangement during rickettsial entry. Fur-
thermore, activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
module facilitates host cell invasion by R. rickettsii in vitro (Ryd-
kina et al., 2005, 2008). Recently, it has been clariﬁed that some of
the other outer membrane proteins belonging to the Sca family,
Sca1, and Sca2, also play roles in host cell adherence and invasion
by rickettsiae (Cardwell and Martinez, 2009; Riley et al., 2010).
Overlay assays involving biotinylated EC, 2D-PAGE, and mass
spectrometry have demonstrated that the β-peptide, Adr1, and
Adr2 are also putative rickettsial adhesins (Renesto et al., 2006).

Successful adherence to and invasion of AeAl2 insect cells was achieved by
both TGR and SFGR soon after their inoculation. The yellow and red arrows
indicate adherent and invading rickettsiae, respectively.

In addition to studies of these early events during the course
of rickettsial infection, there have been many genomic analyses
of the pathogenicity of rickettsiae (Andersson et al., 1998; Li and
Walker, 1998; Ogata et al., 2001; Uchiyama, 2003; Joshi et al., 2004;
Sahni et al., 2005; Whitworth et al., 2005; Uchiyama et al., 2006;
Chan et al., 2009; Fournier et al., 2009; Clark et al., 2011). Rick-
ettsial genomes possess homologs of the virB operon, which is

known to be related to the type IV secretion system (T4SS) and
might be associated with rickettsial pathogenicity. It was reported
that Vero cells that had been infected with R. conorii displayed
upregulated virB operon expression when they were exposed to
nutrient stress (La et al., 2007). The factors secreted by the T4SS,
such as Sec7, LepA, LepB, and patatins, might upregulate the syn-
thesis of nutrients that allow rickettsiae to survive in stressful

Tropism and pathogenicity of rickettsiae

FIGURE 4 | Model of the rickettsia-host cell interactions that occur
during the course of infection. The ﬁrst step in SFGR entry into host cells
is the adhesion of rickettsiae to cells due to the binding of many rickettsial
adhesins to host cell receptors, followed by the activation of intracellular
signaling pathways that induce actin polymerization and membrane
rearrangement, causing the attached rickettsiae to be engulfed. Just after
clathrin and caveolin-2-dependent phagocytosis, rickettsiae escape from
the phagosomes that engulfed them by secreting the phospholipases TlyC

and Pld. In the case of SFGR, the surface molecules RicA and Sca2 recruit
Arp2/3 to polymerize actin, resulting in the formation of an actin tail, which
aids the movement of the bacteria. However, in the case of TGR, R.
prowazekii does not have an actin tail, while R. typhi has a very short actin
tail. SFGR invade the adjacent cells very early in the course of the
infection. Rickettsiae grow within cells by binary ﬁssion. The VirB-related
T4SS is essential for the intracellular survival of rickettsiae as it allows
them to secrete effector molecules.

environments. Moreover, of the ten Staphylococcus aureus genes
(capA–M ) involved in the biosynthesis of capsular polysaccha-
rides, which are related to pathogenicity, three have homologs in
the Rickettsia genome (Lin et al., 1994).

The infection of cultured human EC with R. rickettsii induced
the early cell-to-cell spread of the bacteria, resulting in widespread
membrane damage and ﬁnally cell death (Silverman, 1984). How-
ever, EC are not only injured by infection, but also initiate cellular
responses such as endothelial activation. Speciﬁcally, the infection
of EC with R. rickettsii or R. conorii induces surface platelet adhe-
sion (Silverman, 1986); the release of von Willebrand factor from
Weibel–Palade bodies (Sporn et al., 1991; Teysseire et al., 1992);
and increased expression of tissue factor (Teysseire et al., 1992;
Sporn et al., 1994), E-selectin (Sporn et al., 1993), IL-1α (Kaplan-
ski et al., 1995; Sporn and Marder, 1996), cell-adhesion molecules
(Dignat-George et al., 1997), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-
1 (Drancourt et al., 1990; Shi et al., 2000). The infection of EC
with the TGR R. prowazekii resulted in enhanced prostaglandin
secretion (Walker et al., 1990). Thus, EC infected with rickettsiae
demonstrate procoagulant and proinﬂammatory features, which
might contribute to the severity of rickettsioses. Rickettsial infec-
tion of EC also activates nuclear factor (NF)-κB, which inhibits
apoptosis and mediates the production of the proinﬂammatory
cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1
(Joshi et al., 2004; Bechelli et al., 2009). Conversely, EC activated
by IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, or RANTES degenerate intracellular rick-
ettsiae through nitric oxide production and hydrogen peroxide
production (Valbuena et al., 2002; Rydkina et al., 2004).

A comparative study of rickettsial genomes suggested that
the inactivation of some genes by genome reduction during
the course of their evolution abrogated host-induced rickettsial
growth restriction (Blanc et al., 2007). In fact, a conﬂicting rela-
tionship was detected between a smaller genome size and increased
pathogenicity in rickettsiae, e.g., R. prowazekii, which possesses
a smaller genome, causes more severe symptoms than Rickettsia
species with larger genomes such as R. conorii (Fournier et al.,
2009; Botelho-Nevers and Raoult, 2011). A comparison of the
growth of the virulent and avirulent strains of R. rickettsii revealed
that the relA/spoT gene is essential for growth restriction (Clark
et al., 2011).

The growth kinetics of pathogenic rickettsiae in mammalian
cells were compared with those of non-pathogenic rickettsiae.
Vero and HeLa cells derived from mammals were inoculated with
a non-pathogenic species of SFGR, R. montanensis (Bell et al.,
1963; Uchiyama et al., 2012). The growth of R. montanensis in
the mammalian cells was restricted; however, the infection was
persistent, and low levels of rickettsiae were produced through-
out its course (Figure 5). On the other hand, superinfection of
the R. montanensis-infected cells with the pathogenic R. japonica
resulted in increased yields of the non-pathogenic R. monta-
nensis and R. japonica growth. Western blotting conﬁrmed that
autophagy had been induced in the cells infected with R. monta-
nensis alone. On the contrary, autophagy was restricted in the R.
montanensis-infected cells that had been superinfected with path-
ogenic R. japonica. These results were consistent with the ﬁndings
of ultrastructural observations (Figure 6). Thus, it is suggested

was monitored. Some of the cells that had been infected with non-pathogenic
R. montanensis were superinfected with pathogenic R. japonica on day three

that the growth restriction of the non-pathogenic species, R. mon-
tanensis, was at least partly due to the occurrence of autophagy
in the infected cells and that the pathogenic species, R. japon-
ica, might secrete an unidentiﬁed autophagy restriction factor(s).
Although autophagy is one of the innate defense systems against
invading microbes, other pathogenic bacteria that display intra-
cellular growth, such as Shigella, Listeria, and Burkholderia, also
possess mechanisms for escaping from autophagic degeneration
(Sasakawa, 2010). Shigella escapes from autophagic recognition
by secreting IcsB via the type III secretion system (TTSS; Ogawa
et al., 2005). Listeria recruits the Arp2/3 complex and Ena/VASP to
its surface via the bacterial ActA protein and disguises them from
autophagic recognition (Yoshikawa et al., 2009), and Burkholde-
ria secretes the BopA protein via the TTSS to evade autophagy
(Cullinane et al., 2008). It is also known that the BopA pro-
tein shares 23% homology with IcsB of Shigella. Another of the
putatively non-pathogenic SFGR, Rickettsia sp. LON, which was
isolated from Haemaphysalis longicornis (a tick), but has never
been isolated from human spotted fever patients in Japan (Fujita,
2008; Hanaoka et al., 2009), is genetically closely related to R.
japonica and in fact is classiﬁed within the R. japonica group.
Its growth in mammalian cells was examined in a recent study
(Uchiyama and Fujita, 2012). The growth of Rickettsia sp. LON
is restricted in mammalian cells, as was found for R. montanen-
sis. However, its growth can be recovered by superinfection of
the pathogenic R. japonica. These results further strengthen the
hypothesis that the degree of rickettsial growth in mammalian
cells basically determines the pathogenicity of Rickettsia. Another
non-pathogenic Rickettsia, R. peacockii, which is also known as
the East Side agent, was isolated from Rocky Mountain Wood
ticks (Dermacentor andersoni) from Montana, USA (Bell et al.,
1963; Burgdorfer et al., 1981). R. rickettsii-carrying D. andersoni
display a markedly reduced prevalence on the east side of the Bit-
terroot Valley, while Rocky Mountain spotted fever predominantly
occurs on the west side of the valley (Philip and Casper, 1981).
Thus, the presence of R. peacockii in D. andersoni ticks might
prevent the transovarial transmission of R. rickettsii and limit its
spread in the tick population, although it is uncertain whether R.

peacockii actively interferes with R. rickettsii in ticks or whether
ticks carrying R. peacockii have a reproductive advantage over
those carrying R. rickettsii. R. rickettsii has been demonstrated to
have a lethal effect on its tick vector D. andersoni (Niebylski et al.,
1999). A comparative study has also been performed of the genome
sequences of the pathogenic R. rickettsii and the non-pathogenic
R. peacockii (Niebylski et al., 1997; Felsheim et al., 2009). In R. pea-
cockii, the genes encoding an ankyrin repeat containing protein,
DsbA, RickA, protease II, rOmpA, Sca1, and a putative phospho-
ethanolamine transferase, which are related to its pathogenicity,
were deleted or mutated. The gene coding for the ankyrin repeat
containing protein is especially noteworthy as it is also mutated in
the attenuated Iowa strain of R. rickettsii. The precise mechanisms
by which these factors contribute to the pathogenicity of SFGR are
yet to be clariﬁed.

PERSPECTIVES
The vector tropism of rickettsiae seems to correspond with their
growth in cultured mammalian cells. It has been clariﬁed that
the growth restriction of SFGR in AeAl2 cells depends on the
non-apoptotic cell death induced after host cell adherence and
invasion by rickettsiae. It is important to analyze the mecha-
nisms responsible for this cell death and the cell death inhibition
observed in AeAl2 cells infected with TGR. Moreover, the mech-
anisms responsible for the restriction of TGR growth in tick cells
and the abrogation of the growth restriction in tick cells infected
with SFGR also need to be elucidated.

A relationship was detected between the ability of Rickettsia
species to grow in cultured mammalian cells and their pathogenic-
ity; however, the growth abilities of Rickettsia species are affected
by many host and rickettsial factors during the various stages of
rickettsial infection. In order to elucidate the mechanisms gov-
erning rickettsiae pathogenicity, it is necessary to compare these
factors between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains.

Although I have attempted to elucidate the relationships
between various rickettsiae species and cell types in this review, it is
also necessary to clarify the roles of innate and acquired immunity
against rickettsiae infection.

Tropism and pathogenicity of rickettsiae

FIGURE 6 | Transmission electron microscopy of Vero cells infected with
non-pathogenic and pathogenic SFGR. (A) Vero cells infected with R.
montanensis alone was observed at 7 days after infection. An arrow marks a
degenerating rickettsia in an autophagosome-like vacuole. (B) R.

montanensis-infected cells were superinfected with R. japonica on day three
of infection and observed at 7 days after the ﬁrst infection. Many free
rickettsiae around 1 µm in length surrounded by halos and those in the course
of binary ﬁssion were seen in the cytoplasm. Bars, 1 µm.
