Southeast Asia has become the center of rapid industrial development and economic
growth. However, this growth has far outpaced investment in public infrastructure, leading
to the unregulated release of many pollutants, including wastewater-related contaminants
such as antibiotics. Antibiotics are of major concern because they can easily be released into
the environment from numerous sources, and can subsequently induce development of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Recent studies have shown that for some categories of drugs
this source-to-environment antibiotic resistance relationship is more complex. This review
summarizes current understanding regarding the presence of quinolones, sulfonamides,
and tetracyclines in aquatic environments of Indochina and the prevalence of bacteria resis-
tant to them. Several noteworthy ﬁndings are discussed: (1) quinolone contamination and
the occurrence of quinolone resistance are not correlated; (2) occurrence of the sul sulfon-
amide resistance gene varies geographically; and (3) microbial diversity might be related
to the rate of oxytetracycline resistance.

INTRODUCTION
Since antibiotics were ﬁrst discovered in 1928, they have been
widely used in human and animal medicine. However, most antibi-
otics are excreted and enter the soil or water environments through
wastewater and fertilization with manure (Kümmerer, 2003).
Antibiotic contamination of the natural environment has been
documented in many countries, including those of Europe, North
America, and East Asia, and areas of antibiotic contamination are
widespread throughout the region (Segura et al., 2009). But not
much information is available for Southeast Asia and Africa.

The pathways whereby residual antibiotics enter the environ-
ment are varied and include wastewater efﬂuent discharge and
runoff and leaching from land fertilized with agricultural or
human waste. An increasing number of reports show a rise in
the occurrence and distribution of antibiotics in surface waters
in Europe (Hirsch et al., 1999; McArdell et al., 2003), the USA
(Lindsey et al., 2001; Kolpin et al., 2002; Kim and Carlson, 2007),
and Canada (Metcalfe et al., 2004). Cases of antibiotic contam-
ination of wastewater are also well-known (Göbel et al., 2005;
and others). Some antibiotics can be found in ground water
(Baquero et al., 2008). In China, antibiotics have been found in
animal wastewater, pond water, animal farm efﬂuents, and rivers.
The most frequently detected antibiotics in China include sul-
famethazine (75%), oxytetracycline (64%), tetracycline (60%),
sulfadiazine (55%), and sulfamethoxazole (51%), which were
found at maximum concentrations of 211, 72.9, 10.3, 17.0, and
63.6 ppb, respectively (Wei et al., 2011). In Korea, environmental
contamination with tetracyclines and sulfonamides was reported
at the ppb level (Ok et al., 2011). Recent excellent reviews by
Kümmerer (2009a,b) summarize contamination of the environ-
ment with antibiotics and the spread of antibiotic resistance.

This manuscript will focus on Indochina environment having

unique situation as following.

WHY INDOCHINA? – SPECIFIC SITUATION OF INDOCHINA
Unlike the socioeconomic-uniﬁed continents of Europe and North
America, Asia is more geographically and culturally disjunct, and
cannot be readily grouped as a single geopolitical entity. It there-
fore remains difﬁcult to obtain a generalized theory of antibiotic
and antibiotic resistance contamination across all Asian countries.
This manuscript focuses speciﬁcally on the region of Indochina
and the major antibiotics in this area, including quinolones, sul-
fonamides, and tetracyclines. Countries of “Indochina” include
Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar. Of these,
Vietnam and Thailand have particularly become a center of
rapid industrial development and economic growth; however
this growth has far outpaced investment in public infrastructure,
leading chemical pollution and sanitary issues.

Although Indochina is globally one of the most active regions
of industrial growth and development, there remains few stud-
ies on antibiotic contamination relative to their Western and East
Asian counterparts (Le and Munekage, 2004; Nhiem et al., 2006;
Managaki et al., 2007; Duong et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2009;
Hoa et al., 2011; Takasu et al., 2011). From Asian aquatic envi-
ronments contamination levels are highly variable, ranging from
scales of ppm to ppt (Le and Munekage, 2004; Managaki et al.,
2007; Duong et al., 2008; Hoa et al., 2011; Takasu et al., 2011).
Table 1 summarizes the various antibiotic contaminants that have
been detected in Indochina aquatic environments. Until now for
antibiotic resistance in this area, major reports consisted of stud-
ies on Salmonella isolates (Ogasawara et al., 2008; Sirichote et al.,
2010; and others).

Large amounts of antibiotics are used for human medicine,
livestock farming, and aquaculture in Southeast Asia. In addition,
we observed that antibiotics are used as additives in ice to prevent
decay of harvested ﬁsh in ﬁsh markets. It is believed that high con-
centrations of antibiotics applied in this manner will remain in
the ﬁsh, and will then be taken in by people upon consumption.
Such widespread antibiotic contamination of the environment
and food supply likely promotes the development of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria, both in the environment and within the human
intestine. Prior to the early 2000s, few studies addressed antibiotic
contamination in Indochina (Le and Munekage, 2004), although
the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the region was
reported (Kim et al., 2004; Le et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009).
However, recent studies on drug contamination, combined with
detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and/or resistance genes,
have provided a clearer picture of the problem in this area of Asia
(Hoa et al., 2011; Takasu et al., 2011).

In Indochina, an integrated agriculture–aquaculture farming
system known as VAC (Vegetation, Aquaculture, and Cage) is
common. The VAC system is a recycling farm, typically consist-
ing of a vegetable ﬁeld, an aquaculture pond, and caged animals,
and has been practiced since the 1980s. In the VAC system, live-
stock manure (usually from pigs, chickens, and ducks) is directly
transported to ﬁsh ponds and to vegetable and rice ﬁelds. This
untreated sewage and wastewater from the livestock operations is
used for ﬁsh culture and for fertilization of the vegetable ﬁelds. The
animal manure contributes to the eutrophication of pond water,
which enhances phytoplankton growth. The VAC system is consid-
ered a very economical method of recycling farming (Hop, 2003);
however, the heavy use of antibiotics in livestock increases the
prevalence of enteric antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the potential
for antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria to arise. Subsequent
discharge of antibiotic residues in farm waste likely increases the
number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment, which

in turn promotes the further selection and transfer of antibiotic
resistance genes within the microbial community in the surround-
ing environment (Petersen and Dalsgaard, 2003; Heuer and Smalla,
2007). Recent study by Dang et al. (2011) reported that enteric bac-
teria of pigs in VAC showed high resistance to nalidixic acid and
enroﬂoxacin, which would be dispersed to water environment.
Tetracycline resistance was found at all times with high frequency
(80%<). The VAC system can be thought as a “bazaar of antibiotic
resistance.” That is, the abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria
and genes initially increases in the intestinal tracts of livestock
as a result of exposure to high concentrations of various antibi-
otics. Next, horizontal gene transfer occurs among various bacteria
in the environment surrounding the VAC operation. Antibiotic
resistance genes persist and spread among environmental bacte-
ria through acquisition and recombination. Finally, the antibiotic
resistance genes move to other environments via water use and the
food supply. The antibiotic resistance genes are brought together,
exchanged, and spread in VAC systems. If the antibiotic-resistant
bacteria come into contact with human pathogens and commen-
sal bacteria, the risk to human health may increase signiﬁcantly.
Although there are many snapshot reports of antibiotic resistance
(reviewed in Zhang et al., 2009), further dynamic study is needed
to evaluate the risks posed by the presence of antibiotic resistance
genes in the aquatic environments of developing countries in Asia.

QUINOLONE RESISTANCE
Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are fully synthetic antibiotics that are
widely used in humans, animals, and ﬁsh (Grave et al., 1999; Le
and Munekage, 2004; Samanidou et al., 2005; Kemper, 2008). The
antibacterial mechanism of FQs is based on inhibition of bacterial
DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV, which are enzymes essential for
DNA replication. First-generation FQs are piromidic acid, oxolinic
acid, and nalidixic acid, which were widely used in aquaculture in
the 1970s in Japan. In tropical Asian countries, oxolinic acid still
appears to be one of the major drugs used (Gräslund et al., 2003; Le
and Munekage, 2004). Second-generation (ciproﬂoxacin, CIP and
norﬂoxacin, NOR) and third-generation (levoﬂoxacin, LEV and
its enantiomer oﬂoxacin, OFL) compounds are used in hospitals
and animal husbandry in Indochina (Takasu et al., 2011).

The FQs are photo-degradable, with a half-life in pure water of
105 and 90 min for NOR and CIP, respectively (Burhenne et al.,
1997). However, FQs in the environment are relatively stable in
water and sediment (Kümmerer, 2004; Le and Munekage, 2004),
which might be due to sorption onto particulates (Nowara et al.,
1997). Lai and Lin (2009) reported that oxolinic acid and ﬂume-
quine could be retained in sediment for 9.5–15 and 3.6–6.4 days,
respectively. Such long half-lives in the environment pose a selec-
tive pressure for environmental bacteria. Although the bioavail-
ability of antibiotics is suspected to decrease upon adsorption
on clay and humic substances, no supporting evidence has been
reported.

Holmström et al. (2003) reported that 74% of Thailand
shrimp aquaculture farmers use antibiotics, primarily NOR. Le
and Munekage (2004) reported detecting NOR at 0.5–3.5 ppm in
the water column and 200–1500 ppm in the sediment of inten-
sive ponds and improved extensive ponds in Vietnam. Oxolinic
acid could be detected in the water column at a concentration

similar to that of NOR, but not in the sediment. The “water col-
umn concentration” indicates present inﬂow, while the “sediment
concentration” indicates the value integrated over time (Takasu
et al., 2011). The presence of antibiotics in both samples suggests
that the compounds being used at present and are retained in the
sediment.

Ciproﬂoxacin is commonly used with other drugs, such as
griseofulvin, rifampicin, and oxytetracycline for shrimp larvae in
Vietnam (Thuy et al., 2011). The most recent quantiﬁcation of
FQs in Indochina aquatic environments showed that the average
concentrations were higher in Thailand (OFL, 7400 ppb; NOR,
209 ppb; CIP, 328 ppb; LOM, 67.4 ppb) than in Vietnam (OFL,
255 ppb; NOR, 41.1 ppb; CIP, 162 ppb; LOM, 25.3 ppb; Takasu
et al., 2011). Both OFL and NOR were conﬁrmed as major environ-
mental contaminants in both countries; however, contamination
at aquaculture sites was lower than at VAC farms and city canals in
both countries. A recent decrease in drug application and/or dilu-
tion effects may explain the improved contamination situation in
aquaculture settings. Since FQs are not natural compounds, it is
believed that bacteria do not possess FQ resistance genes. However,
bacteria resistant to FQs can be found easily. Several resistance
mechanisms have been reported, including mutation of DNA
gyrase (Fukuda et al., 1990), impermeability to FQs due to loss of
porins, and extrusion by overexpressed efﬂux pumps (Hirai et al.,
1986, 1987). A number of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
(PMQR) genes (qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS) have also been identiﬁed
(Robicsek et al., 2006). These PMQR genes are transferred hori-
zontally among bacteria and encode a protein of the pentapeptide
repeat family that has been shown to block the actions of FQs
on puriﬁed DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (Robicsek et al.,
2006). The origin of these genes is thought to be chromosomes in
aquatic bacteria (Poirel et al., 2005a,b; Cattoir et al., 2008). Thus,
the aquatic environment is hypothesized to be a natural reservoir
of FQ-resistant bacteria and resistance genes.

As mentioned above, the environmental concentration of FQs
was found to be much higher in Thailand than in Vietnam.
Despite the lower level of contamination, the occurrence rate of
FQ-resistant bacteria was found to be higher in Vietnam than
Thailand (Takasu et al., 2011). Takasu et al. (2011) demonstrated
that there is no relationship between the concentration of FQs in
the environment and the rate of bacterial resistance. Kümmerer
(2003) reported that exposure to a sub-inhibitory concentration
induces the emergence of resistant bacteria in aquatic environ-
ments. It was reported that FQs at concentrations 10–100 times
lower than the MIC induce the expression of a functional gene
(Herold et al., 2005), mutations (Gillespie et al., 2005), and mor-
phological changes (Loubeyre et al., 1993) at the single-cell level.
Low concentrations are thus effective inducers of drug-resistant
bacteria. The effect of disinfectants on bacteria is considerably
reduced in the presence of organic matter (Kawamura-Sato et al.,
2008), suggesting that the actual active concentration in the envi-
ronment might be lower than analysis suggests. The importance
of low concentrations of FQs to the development of antibiotic
resistance should not be ignored, and additional research involv-
ing both instrumental analyses and bioassays is needed to esti-
mate the actual concentration of FQs acting upon environmental
bacteria.

A broad range of bacteria can acquire resistance to FQs, includ-
ing enteric bacteria (Escherichia coli), pathogenic bacteria (e.g.,
Acinetobacter), and aquatic bacteria (e.g., Brevundimonus). Pro-
teobacteria and Actinobacteria are the major taxa of FQ-resistant
bacteria (Takasu et al., 2011), indicating that FQ-resistant bacte-
ria are not limited to speciﬁc groups. It was hypothesized that
bacteria from humans and animals as well as natural aquatic bac-
teria are potential reservoirs of FQ resistance genes. A number
of resistance genes have been identiﬁed in FQ-resistant bacte-
ria, including qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6
)-Ib-cr (Takasu et al.,
2011). Since qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS are thought to have originated
from the chromosomes of water-dwelling bacteria (Poirel et al.,
2005a,b), it is possible that these genes can be transferred from
aquatic bacteria to human bacteria (Hernández et al., 2011). To
date, PMQR genes including aac (6
)-Ib-cr, which are linked with
other drug resistance genes and are transferable, have only been
discovered in Gammaproteobacteria such as Vibrio (Poirel et al.,
2005a), Shewanella (Poirel et al., 2005b), and Aeromonas (Cattoir
et al., 2008; Picao et al., 2008) in the environment. The num-
ber of FQ-resistant Salmonella enterica isolates found in Thailand
increased in the late 1990s, and the resistant isolates possessed the
same gyrA region, suggesting rapid spread of the resistant bacte-
ria (Hakanen et al., 2001). The gyrA mutation is located on the
chromosome, but recent research indicates that gyrA can also be
transferred (Ferrandiz et al., 2000). Spreading of both resistant
bacteria and chromosomal resistance genes might be a cause of the
observed widespread drug resistance in Asia. However, precisely
how FQ resistance genes are spread among various environments
is not known, although mutation-based resistance and transferable
genes should be considered. The dynamics of FQ resistance genes
are of interest and importance from the viewpoints of human
clinical and gene evolution studies.

SULFONAMIDE RESISTANCE
Sulfonamides, which are also synthetic antibiotics, have been
widely used to treat bacterial and protozoan infections in humans,
domestic animals, and aquaculture species since their introduc-
tion to clinical practice in 1935 (Perreten and Boerlin, 2003; Le and
Munekage, 2004; Blahna et al., 2006). Sulfonamides inhibit folate
biosynthesis by competing with the natural substrate p-amino-
benzoic acid for binding to dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS),
an enzyme in the folic acid synthesis pathway. While the use of
sulfonamides in humans has decreased in developed countries,
they are still frequently used in developing Asian countries due
to their low cost (Macrolides are 1–3 $/tablet, whereas sulfon-
amides are 2 cent/tablet in Vietnam). Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a
commonly used sulfonamide analog, was detected at ppm levels
in shrimp ponds in Vietnam in the late 1990s (Le and Munek-
age, 2004). Although such levels are extremely high, SMX levels
in rivers in Japan and Vietnam are typically around 100 ppt in
recent years (Managaki et al., 2007). This was conﬁrmed in vari-
ous locations in Vietnam (Hoa et al., 2011), where concentrations
were in the 600–4000 ppt range throughout the year in a city
canal. Trimethoprim was detected in the 20–1800 ppt range as
well, probably because it is often used with SMX. In livestock
farm wastewater, the concentration of SMX was lower, in the 68–
600 ppt range, whereas that of sulfamethazine was much higher

(400–6000 ppt). Other sulfonamides were either not detected or
found at trace levels, suggesting that SMX and sulfamethazine are
the major sulfonamides in use in Vietnam at present.

Since sulfonamides inhibit the formation of dihydrofolic acid
(Perreten and Boerlin, 2003), bacterial resistance to sulfonamides
can occur through mutations in the chromosomal DHPS gene
(folP) or through acquisition of an alternative DHPS gene (sul)
whose product has a low afﬁnity for sulfonamides (Perreten and
Boerlin, 2003). Acquisition of sulfonamide resistance through sul
genes is the most prevalent mechanism (Enne et al., 2002; Perreten
and Boerlin, 2003). Sulfonamide resistance is globally prevalent
among human and animal pathogens (Kerrn et al., 2002; Perreten
and Boerlin, 2003; Antunes et al., 2005); however, the presence of
sul genes is not equally distributed among bacterial populations
(Kerrn et al., 2002; Antunes et al., 2005; Hammerum et al., 2006).
Reports from Asia are not uniform regarding the distribution of sul
genes. The sul2 gene, which is related to class I integron, is common
in Acinetobacter isolated from ﬁsh farms and chicken manure in
Thailand (Agersø and Petersen, 2007). However, Hoa et al. (2008)
reported that sul1 was the major sul gene among SMX-resistant
bacteria isolated from VAC farms, city canals, and aquaculture sites
in Vietnam. Most of these reports were based on isolated bacteria,
which may bias interpretation of results due to the processes of
isolation; therefore, we cannot obtain an accurate assessment of
the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes from culturable bac-
teria alone. A direct quantiﬁcation approach indicated that sul1 is
the major sulfonamide resistance gene in lagoon and river waters
in the USA (Pruden et al., 2006). It is likely that such non-culture
monitoring of antibiotic resistance genes will increase in the near
future (for example, Pei et al., 2006). A culture-dependent study
of SMX-resistant bacteria revealed that Acinetobacter is one of
the major reservoirs of sul genes in Asian aquatic environments
(Agersø and Petersen, 2007; Hoa et al., 2011). Since Acinetobacter,
especially A. baumannii, is known to be an important oppor-
tunistic pathogen with multi-drug resistance (Vila and Pachón,
2011), the risk posed by environmental A. baumannii to human
health should be examined further. Low concentration of SMX
can affect on bacterial nitrate metabolism and select bacterial
species (Underwood et al., 2011), suggesting importance of trace
contamination by SMX.

TETRACYCLINE RESISTANCE
Tetracyclines are a family of broad-spectrum antibiotics that
includes tetracycline, oxytetracycline (OTC), chlortetracycline,
doxycycline, and minocycline (Chopra and Roberts, 2001). These
antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis in Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria by preventing the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA
molecules to the 30S ribosomal subunit (Geigenmuller and Nier-
haus, 1986; Ross et al., 1998). Owing to their broad-spectrum
activity and low toxicity, tetracyclines are used in the treat-
ment of a number of human skin and dental diseases. Tetracy-
clines are also used in agriculture as growth promoters in farm
animals and are used widely as prophylaxes in plant agricul-
ture and aquaculture around the world (Chopra and Roberts,
2001), including Southeast Asia (Thuy et al., 2011). The ﬁrst-
generation tetracyclines include OTC, chlorotetracycline, and 6-
demethylchlorotetracycloine, which were developed in the 1940s.

Antibiotic resistance in Asia

Minocycline and doxycycline were launched as second-generation
drugs in the 1960s (Thaker et al., 2010). A new glycylcycline deriv-
ative, tigecycline, which is active against most OTC-resistant bac-
teria, Acinetobacter, MRSA, and extended-spectrum β-lactamase
(ESBL) producers, was licensed in 2005 (Livermore, 2005). Despite
the variety of available analogs, OTC is still commonly used in ani-
mal production and aquaculture (Holmström et al., 2003; Nonaka
et al., 2007; and others), although use as growth promoters has
been banned in EU until 2006 (Castanon, 2007). As tetracycline-
resistant bacteria, high occurrence of tetracycline-resistant Salmo-
nella from human (50%) and animals (pig 34% and poultry 76%)
are reported in Vietnam (Vo et al., 2010), as well as Enterococ-
cus and E. coli (both 80%<; Dang et al., 2011). Similar results
are known in Thailand, e.g., chicken (42%) and chicken meat
(45%), and pork (11%) and pork meat (20%; Ogasawara et al.,
2008).

Tetracycline resistance genes, tet series, from the resistant bac-
teria have been well-studied (Roberts, 2005; and others). The tet
genes are classiﬁed by mechanism of action. Studies have indi-
cated that some tet genes are persistent in aquaculture site without
selective pressure (Tamminen et al., 2011), pristine environments
and in animals (Gilliver et al., 1999; Rahman et al., 2008a,b), sug-
gesting that they have a natural origin. Tracking of tet genes in
aquatic environments, including pristine areas, has been exam-
ined in the USA (Pruden et al., 2006; Storteboom et al., 2010a,b),
Japan (Kim et al., 2004; Nonaka et al., 2007), and other countries
(Zhang and Zhang, 2011); however, similar research in Indochina
aquatic environments is limited (Kobayashi et al., 2007a; Suzuki
et al., 2008). Monitoring and phylogenetic analyses are needed
if we are to obtain a thorough understanding of the origin and
spread dynamics of tet genes. Kobayashi et al. (2007a) detected
tet(M), tet(S), and tet(W) genes throughout the Mekong River
Delta. They found that tet(S) and tet(W) have only one geno-
type each, while tet(M) has at least two genotypes. One tet(M)
genotype is identical to the gene encoded in various plasmids and
transposons of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and
another is similar to a gene encoded in Tn1545 of Enterococcus
faecalis (99% identity in PCR product, 170 bp/171 bp). Since the
two types could be found in the same sample, it was assumed that
more than one source of the gene exists. This hypothesis was partly
conﬁrmed by microbial diversity analysis using denatured gradient
gel electrophoresis analysis, which indicated a positive relationship
between the Shannon index (H
) value and the tet gene detection-
and OTC-resistant bacteria occurrence-rates across a wide area,
ranging from the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia to
the South China Sea (Suzuki et al., 2008).

(cid:2)

Gene exchange and horizontal transfer among various bac-
terial species in natural environments have been demonstrated
(Smets and Barkay, 2005). Ribosomal protection protein (RPP)
genes, including tet(M), tet(S), and tet(W), are transferred among
bacteria (Chopra and Roberts, 2001), and this phenomenon was
experimentally conﬁrmed using combinations of marine bac-
teria (gene donors) and E. coli (Neela et al., 2009). However,
another hypothesis was proposed by Kobayashi et al. (2007b),
which holds that the RPP genes were derived through duplication
and divergence of an ancient GTPase before the divergence of the

three domains. The RPPs may have originally provided ribosomal
protection against other chemical substances in the environment.
It is known that exposing microbial assemblages to one toxicant
can result in indirect selection for bacteria with resistance to mul-
tiple, chemically unrelated toxicants (Baker-Austin et al., 2006;
Baker et al., 2006). For example, exposure to Cd, Ni, ampicillin,
and tetracycline signiﬁcantly increases the frequency of bacterial
resistance to multiple, chemically unrelated metals and antibiotics
(Stepanauskas et al., 2006). Metals and antibiotics are known not
only for being associated to similar efﬂux pumps, but also for
inducing co-resistance (Baker-Austin et al., 2006; Baker et al.,
2006). Aquatic environments in Indochina are highly contami-
nated with many kinds of persistent organic pollutants, metals
(Suzuki and Takada, 2009), and antibiotics (Managaki et al., 2007;
Hoa et al., 2011). Under such conditions, environmental bacteria
can acquire drug resistance naturally over time as well as through
horizontal gene transfer. Both transferable paralogous resistance
genes and canonical resistance genes might be present in natural
environments. From the viewpoint of both drug resistance and
evolutionary biology, RPP genes are thus of considerable interest
(Kobayashi et al., 2007b).

CONCLUSION
Indochina aquatic environments are particularly vulnerable to the
development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to pollution with
antibiotics and other chemicals in the absence of adequate waste-
water treatment systems. Recent important ﬁndings concerning
antibiotic resistance are as follows: (1) sub-lethal concentrations
of antibiotics accelerate the development of antibiotic resistance
(Yeh et al., 2009; Gullberg et al., 2010), and (2) chemicals other
than antibiotics can promote development of antibiotic resis-
tance (Alonso et al., 2001; Baker-Austin et al., 2006). Both of
these scenarios are suspected to occur in natural environments,
especially in Asian countries. Correlation between the number
of antibiotic drugs detected and the occurrence of multi-drug-
resistant bacteria in Vietnam was found (Hoa et al., 2011), indi-
cating that multi-drug contamination is almost certain to result
in an increase in the prevalence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria
in aquatic environments. It is important to note that contamina-
tion with various antibiotics correlates strongly with induction of
multi-drug resistance, even if the contaminant concentration is
low. Multi-drug resistance is a serious issue, particularly in Asia,
and is likely to become of even greater concern in the future.
Furthermore, contamination of antibiotics with trace concentra-
tions can alter microbial ecosystem in terms of metabolism and
diversity (Underwood et al., 2011), indicating the importance to
consider unexpectedly effect than antimicrobial resistance. There
is still a considerable gap in knowledge regarding the environ-
mental chemistry and microbiology in the environment. Chemical
and microbial monitoring in aquatic environments should thus be
accelerated worldwide.
