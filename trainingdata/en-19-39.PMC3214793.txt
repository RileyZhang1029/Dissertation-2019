ABSTRACT

SRG3  (SWI3-related  gene)  is  a  core  subunit  of  mouse  SWI/SNF  complex  and  is 
known  to  play  a  critical  role  in  stabilizing  the  SWI/SNF  complex  by  attenuating  its 
proteasomal  degradation.  SWI/SNF  chromatin  remodeling  complex  is  reported  to  act  as 
an  important  endogenous  regulator  in  the  proliferation  and  differentiation  of  mammalian 
neural  stem  cells.  Because  limited  expression  of  SRG3  occurs  in  the  brain  and  thymus 
during  mouse  embryogenesis,  it  was  hypothesized  that  the  altered  SRG3  expression 
level  might  affect 
the 
embryonic  lethality  of  homozygous  knockout  mice,  this  study  focuses  on  dissecting  the 
effect  of  overexpressed  SRG3  on  adult  hippocampal  neurogenesis.  The  BrdU 
incorporation  assay,  immunostaing  with  neuronal  markers  for  each  differentiation  stage, 
and  imunoblotting  analysis  with  intracellular  molecules  involved  in  survival  in  adult 
hippocampal  neurogenesis  found  no  alteration,  suggesting  that  the  overexpression  of 
SRG3  protein  in  mature  neurons  had  no  effect  on  the  entire  process  of  adult 
hippocampal  neurogenesis  including  proliferation,  differentiation,  and  survival.

INTRODUCTION

    Mammalian  SWI/SNF  complex,  also  known  as 
BAF  (Brg/Brm-associated  factor)  complex,  is  a  ＞2 
MDa  multiprotein  chromatin  remodeling  complex 
composed  of  at  least  10  elements  and  contain  BRG 
or  BRM  subunit  as  a  central  core  ATPase  subunit.

All  subunits  of  SWI/SNF  are  well  conserved  from 
yeast  to  human,  reflecting  the  functional  signifi-
cance  of  the  SWI/SNF  complex  (Tsukiyama,  2002). 
SWI/SNF  complex  is  involved  in  various  biological 
events  such  as  tumor  suppression,  regulation  of 
immune  system,  neural  development  and  plasticity 
(Roberts  and  Orkin,  2004).  A  diverse  composition  of 
SWI/SNF  complex  subunits  determines  which 
transcription 
factors  or  coactivators/corepressors 
activate  or  repress 
target  genes.  For  example, 
transcription  factors  including  C/EBP,  c-Myc  and 
c-Fos/c-Jun  activate  target  genes  by  cooperating 

40 Byungwoo  Kim,  et  al.

with  the  SWI/SNF  complex  (Cheng  et  al.,  1999). 
Likewise,  the  SWI/SNF  complex  represses  neuron- 
specific  genes  in  nonneuronal  cells  through  the 
association  with  neuron  restrictive  silencer  factor 
(NRSF)  and  its  corepressors,  mSin3A  and  CoREST 
(Battaglioli  et  al.,  2002;  Watanabe  et  al.,  2006).
    SRG3  (SWI3-related  gene)  is  a  recently  found 
subunit  of  mouse  SWI/SNF  complex  and  has  a  high 
homology  to  a  yeast  transcriptional  activator  SWI3 
and  human  BAF155  proteins  (Jeon  et  al.,  1997). 
Although  SRG3  is  widely  expressed  during  early 
mouse  embryogenesis,  its  main  expression  is  limit-
ed  to  thymus  and  brain  around  E18.5,  suggesting  a 
role  for  SRG3  in  the  immune  and  the  nervous 
system  (Kim  et  al.,  2001).  SRG3  heterozygote  mice 
frequently  show  exencephaly  (Kim  et  al.,  2001). 
Interestingly, 
the  expression  pattern  of  SRG3 
overlaps  with  that  of  Brg1,  and  Brg1  heterozygote 
mice  also  have  high 
incidence  of  exencephaly 
(Bultman  et  al.,  2000).  Brg1  is  constantly  expressed 
during  differentiation  of  neural  progenitor  cells  (NPC) 
and  P19  embryonic  carcinoma  cells  (Machida  et  al., 
2001).  It  is  also  required  for  the  proneural  activites 
of  Ngnr1,  NeuroD  and  for  neuronal  differentiation  in 
both  Xenopus  and  P19  (Seo  et  al.,  2005).  In 
zebrafish,  Brg1  deficiency 
impaires  neural  crest 
induction  and  has  defects  in  neurogenesis  (Eroglu 
et  al.,  2006).  Moreover,  SRG3  interacts  directly  with 
BRG1  through  SANT  domain  (Sohn  et  al.,  2007), 
suggesting  that  SRG3  might  presumably  be  funct-
ional  in  neural  development.
    The  whole  step  of  adult  neurogenesis  is  sub-
divided  into  proliferation,  cell  cycle  exit,  differentiat-
ion  and  functional  maturity  (Ehninger  and  Kemper-
mann,  2008).  Each  step  is  tightly  controlled  by  a 
variety  of  extrinsic  and  intrinsic  factors,  most  of 
which  remain  uncharacterized  (Zhao  et  al.,  2008). 
Intriguingly,  SWI/SNF  chromatin  remodeling  com-
plex  acts  as  an  important  endogenous  regulator  in 
the  proliferation  and  differentiation  of  mammalian 
neural  stem  cells  (Lessard  et  al.,  2007).  The  switch 
of  subunits  from  BAF45a  and  BAF53a  to  BAF45b, 
BAF45c,  and  BAF53b  is  essential  for  the  transition 
from  neural  stem/progenitors  to  postmitotic  neurons, 
suggesting  that  the  genetic  disturbance  of  only  one 
subunit  might  disorganize  the  entire  process  of 
adult  hippocampal  neurogenesis.  Therefore,  in  this 
study,  the  functional  significance  of  SRG3  and  how 

chromatin  remodeling  complex  contributes  to  main-
tain  the  integrity  of  adult  hippocampal  neurogenesis 
was  approached  by  analyzing  the  effect  of  over-
expressed  SRG3  on  adult  hippocampal  neurogne-
sis. 

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

Animals

    The  knock-in  transgenic  (TG)  mice  overexpress-
ing  SRG3  were  provided  by  Dr.  R.H.  Seong  (Seoul 
National  University).  These  mice  are  heterozygous 
for  overexpressed  SRG3  and  produced  and  main-
tained  in  FVB  background.  The  mouse  SRG3  gene 
is  designed  to  be  overexpressed  in  neurons  of 
forebrain  regions  by  mouse  CaMKII  (calcium/calmo-
dulin-dependent  protein  kinase  II)  α promoter  (11.5 
kb)  (Benson  et  al.,  1992;  Jacobs  et  al.,  1993; 
Mayford  et  al.,  1996).  The  transgenic  offspring  was 
generated  by  crossing  heterozygous 
transgenic 
mice  with  wild  type  FVB  mice  and  genotyped  by 
PCR  using  sense  primer  5’-GACTA  GACCA  AACAT 
CTACC  TC-3’,  antisense  primer  5’-GTCAA  CTGAG 
CGACT  TGGAT  C-3’.  Mice  were  bred  and  main-
tained  under  pathogen-free  conditions,  and  experi-
ments  were  performed  in  accordance  with  institut-
ional  guidelines  of  Hanyang  University  Veterinary 
Committee.  To  evaluate  the  proliferation  in  subgra-
nular  zone  (SGZ)  of  adult  hippocampus,  5-bromo- 
2’-deoxyuridine 
(100  mg/kg  bodyweight, 
Sigma-Aldrich)  was  daily  administered  intraperiton-
eally  to  twenty  week-old  male  TG  mice  for  3  days 
and  then  animals  were  sacrificed  2  h  after  the  last 
injection.

Immunohistochemistry

    After  anesthetized  with  Ketamine/Xylazine  cock-
tail,  animals  were  intracardially  perfused  with  cold 
normal  saline  and,  in  turn,  ice-cold  4%  paraform-
aldehyde  in  PBS.  Isolated  brains  were  postfixed  in 
4%  paraformaldehyde  in  PBS  overnight  at  4oC,  and 
then  fully  dehydrated  in  30%  sucrose  in  PBS. 
Slices  were  prepared  as  30-μm-thick.  For  immun-
operoxidase  staining,  free-floating  sections  were  first 
treated  with  1%  H2O2  for  15  min  and  washed  three 
times  with  PBS.  After  incubated  in  blocking  buffer 
(0.3%  Triton  X-100/5%  normal  serum  in  PBS)  for  1 
h,  they  were  placed  in  primary  antibody  solution 
overnight  at  4oC.  Primary  antibodies  used  are  goat

(Vector  Laboratories).  For  BrdU  immunofluorescent 
staining,  sections  were  incubated  in  50%  form-
amide/50%  2X  SSC  buffer  (0.3  M  NaCl  and  0.03  M 
sodium  citrate)  at  65oC  for  2  h  and  rinsed  with  2X 
SSC  buffer  for  10  min.  They  were  then  incubated 
for  30  min  in  2  N  HCl  at  37oC  and  rinsed  in  0.1  M 
boric  acid  (pH  8.5)  for  15  min.  After  PBS  wash, 
they  were  incubated  in  blocking  buffer  for  1  h  and 
rat  anti-BrdU  antibody  (1：200,  Abcam)  solution 
overnight  at  4oC.  For  Tuj-1  (1：400,  Covance), 
PSA-NCAM  (1：100,  Chemicon  International),  NeuN 
(1：500,  Chemicon  International),  MAP2  (1：400, 
Sigma-Aldrich)  and  Dcx  (1：200,  Santa  Cruz  Bio-
technology),  the  incubation  in  formamide/2X  SSC 
buffer  and  2  N  HCl  was  skipped.  Cy3-conjugated 
anti-IgG  (Jackson  ImmunoResearch,  West  Grove, 
PA,  USA)  and  Alexa  Fluor  488-conjugated  anti-IgG 
(Molecular  Probes,  Eugene,  OR,  USA)  were  used 
as  secondary  antibody.  The  samples  were  mounted 
with  Vectashield  (Vector  Laboratories).

forebrain  regions 

    To  confirm  whether  SRG3  overexpression  trans-
genic  mice  are  working  as  genetically  designed  to 
be  driven  by  CaMKIIα promoter,  which  expresses 
in  postmitotic  neurons 
like 
neocortex,  hippocampus  and  amygdala  (Benson  et 
al.,  1992;  Jacobs  et  al.,  1993),  SRG3  TG  mice 
were  examined 
forebrain-specific  over-
expression  of  SRG3.  The  gross  brain  morphology 
and  size  of  20-week-old  male  SRG3  TG  was  not 
different  from  that  of  wild  type  (Fig.  1A),  suggesting 
that  overall  development  of  brain  is  not  affected  by 
the  overexpression  of  SRG3.  Both  hemispheres 
were  symmetrical,  and  the  size  of  cerebellum  and 
olfactory  bulb  where  CaMKIIα  promoter 
is  not 
activated  also  looks  similar  in  SRG3  TG  and  wild 
type  (wt)  animals.  The  normal  development  of 
neocortex  and 
like 
dentate  gyrus  (DG),  CA3  and  CA1  of  SRG3  TG 
mouse  was  confirmed  by  DAPI 
labeling  on  a 

coronal  section  at  postbregma −2.0  mm  (Fig.  1A).

level 

The  expression  of  SRG3  was  evaluated  at  the 
levels  of  mRNA  and  protein.  Real-time  RT-PCR 
showed  the  forebrain  specific  overexpression  of 
SRG3  gene  (Fig.  1B,  hippocampus,  2.6-fold  in-
crease;  cortex,  2.4-fold  increase;  cerebellum,  1.3- 
fold  increase;  respectively  compared  with  wt,  n=1). 
The  SRG3  protein 
revealed  by  western 
blotting  using  antiserum  against  BAF155,  a  human 
homologue  of  SRG3,  also  significantly  increased  in 
SRG3  TG  mice  compared  to  in  wild  type  (mean± 
SEM;  hippocampus,  143.7±5%  vs  wild;  cortex, 
137.9±5.6%  vs  wild,  *p＜0.05  respectively,  n=3  per 
group)  (Fig.  1C).  In  order  to  compare  the  ex-
pression  lelvel  of  SRG3  protein  in  individual  neur-
ons,  immunoperoxidase  acativity  against  SRG3  was 
examined  in  brain  slices  from  both  groups.  The 
SRG3  signal  was  detected  in  the  nuclei  (Fig.  1D 
inset)  and  it  displayed  more  intense  signals  in 
SRG3  TG  mice  forebrain  region  than  in  wt  (Fig.  1 
D).  These  results  consistently  demonstrate  that  the 
genetic  manipulation  for  a  SRG3  overexpression 
TG  mouse 
reliablely  working,  showing  an 
increased  expression  pattern  for  SRG3  mRNA  and

Proliferation  of  neural  progenitor  cells  in  SGZ 
is  not  affected  by  the  overexpression  of  SRG3
    To  determine  whether 
the  overexpression  of 
SRG3  causes  an  altered  pattern  in  the  proliferation 
of  neural  progenitor  cells,  the  number  of  newly 
generated  progenitor  cells  in  SGZ  was  examined  by 
incorporation  of  BrdU.  Although  CaMKIIα 
the 
promoter  does  not  operate  in  proliferating  cells,  the 
neural  progenitor  cells 
the  DG  of  adult 
hippocampus  can  be  affected  indirectly  by  post-
mitotic  neurons  (Chen  et  al.,  2007)  overexpressing 
SRG3  gene  by  CaMKIIα promoter.  BrdU  immun-
opositive  (BrdU＋)  cells  were  counted  within  SGZ 
throughout  the  DG  of  both  genotypes  (Fig.  2A). 
Some  BrdU＋  cells  were  found  in  clusters  like 
those  in  the  previous  reports  (Yagita  et  al.,  2001; 
Zhu  et  al.,  2005;  Hodge  et  al.,  2008).  The  total 
number  of  BrdU＋ cells  located  in  the  SGZ  (mean± 
SEM;  wt,  1,099±63/mm3  vs.  SRG3  TG,  1,024± 
59/mm3,  p＞0.1,  n=4  per  group)  was  not  statistically 
different  between  wt  and  SRG3  TG  mice  (Fig.  2B),

indicating  that  the  proliferation  was  not  affected  by 
the  overexpression  of  SRG3.
    Cell  proliferation  in  the  subventricular  zone  (SVZ) 
of  a  lateral  ventricle  was  also  examined  (Gould, 
2007).  Though  CaMKIIα promoter  operates  only  in 
matured  neurons,  a  possible  effect  of  the  over-
expression  of  SRG3  on  the  proliferation  pattern  of 
SVZ  was  needed  to  be  checked  when  considering 
of  SVZ  as  another  important  niche  for  adult  neuro-
genesis.  However,  no  difference  in  the  proliferation 
rate  in  SVZ  was  found  in  both  genotypes  (Fig.  2C). 

Neuronal  development  looks  normal  in  the 
hippocampus  and  cortex  of  SRG3  TG  mice

    To  determine  whether  early  neuronal  develop-
ment  is  normally  organized  in  SRG3  TG  mice, 
postomitotic  differentiation  in  a  hippocampal  region 
was  immunostained  with  early  neuronal  markers. 
During  postmitotic  and  neuronal  differentiation  stage 
in  adult  hippocampal  neurogenesis,  most  newborn 
neurons  are  destined  to  die,  but  only  survived 
neurons  mature  to  integrate  into  a  functional  neural 
circuit  (Tashiro  et  al.,  2007).  Previous  studies 
reported  that  cells  committed  to  a  neuronal  lineage 
start  to  express  doublecortin  (Dcx)  (Francis  et  al., 
1999)  and  the  polysialylated  embryonic  form  of  the 
neural  cell  adhesion  molecule  (PSA-NCAM),  right 
after  they  exit  out  of  the  cell  cycle  (Fukuda  et  al., 

the 

2003).  The  total  number  of  Dcx  immunoreactive 
(Dcx＋)  cells  in  the  hippocami  of  SRG3  TG  mice 
was  not  significantly  changed  compared  to  that  of 
wt  (mean  number±SEM:  wt,  9,974±450/mm3;  SRG3 
TG,  9,133±701/mm3,  p＞0.1,  n=4  per  group), 
suggesting  that  neuronal  differentiation  of  neural 
progenitor  cells  in  the  hippocampus  of  adult  SRG3 
TG  mice  seems  normal  during  early  postmitotic 
period  (Fig.  3A).  As  Dcx  expression  is  temporally 
overlapped  with  PSA-NCAM  expression  on  the  time 
course  of  development, 
immunoreactivity  of 
PSA-NCAM＋ cells  on  randomly  chosen  brain  slices 
from  both  genotypes  cells  was  compared  (Nacher 
et  al.,  2001).  It  turns  out  that  the  number  and  the 
signal  intensity  of  PSA-NCAM＋ cells  was  apparently 
similar  to  result  of  Dcx  immunostaining  and  there  is 
no  difference  between  SRG3  TG  and  wt  groups.
    In  order  to  know  what  effect  the  overexpressed 
SRG3  on  mature  neurons  has  on  the  maturation  of 
the  hippocampi  and  cortex,  Tuj-1  was  used  as  a 
neuroblast  marker  as  well  as  a  fully  differentiated 
neuronal  marker 
to  examine  SRG3  TG  mice. 
Neuron-specific  class  III  β-tubulin  (Tuj-1)  has  been 
found  to  be  expressed  in  newly  generated  immature 
postmitotic  neurons  (Menezes  and  Luskin,  1994) 
and  in  mature  neurons  (Ambrogini  et  al.,  2004) 
(Fig.  3C).  Tuj-1  was  detected 
in  somata  and 
neurites  of  neurons  within  cortex,  CA1  and  DG.

and  cortical  neurons  (a,  b).  Phosphorylated  CREB  (pCREB)  was  detected  in  nuclei  of  cells  within  SGZ  (o,  p)  and  across  cortical  layers 
(i,  j).  Scale  bar=100μm.

there  were  some  cells 

immunolabeled,  as  MAP2  and  NeuN  have  been 
known  as  mature  neuronal  markers  (Menezes  and 
Luskin,  1994).  The  signal  was  detected  at  dendrites 
and  somata  of  neurons  (Fig.  4A)  as  reported 
previously  (Biranowska  et  al.,  2000;  Jalava  et  al., 
2007).  Though 
in  SGZ

mature  or  proliferating  cells.  The  distribution  and 
immunoreactivity  of  MAP2  immunopositive  (MAP2＋) 
cells  in  the  cortex  and  the  hippocampus  was  not 
significantly  different  in  SRG3  TG  and  wt  animals 
(Fig.  4A).  In  addition,  the  immubolabeling  of  NeuN, 
a  nuclear  protein  for  labeling  the  nuclei  of  mature 
neurons  (Lind  et  al.,  2005),  displayed  a  similar 
pattern  in  SRG3  TG  and  wt  mice  (Fig.  4B),  sug-
gesting  that  the  late  neuronal  differentiation  process 
during  adult  hippocampal  neurogenesis  and

    Though  the  immunostaining  with  MAP2  and  Tuj-1 
results  in  no  impaired  pattern  of  the  survival  of 
newly  generated  hippocampal  neurons  by 
the 
overexpressed  SRG3,  this  might  not  mean  that  the 
is  completely  normal.  To 
neuronal  maturation 
determine  whether 
is  not 
altered  in  a  subtle  manner  by  the  overexpression  of 
SRG3,  CREB  activation,  which  is  a  critical  step  for 
survival  of  newborn  neurons  in  a  hippocampus 
(Nakagawa  et  al.,  2002),  was  examined  using 
western  blotting  and  immunolabeling.  ERK1/2  and 
CaMKII,  critical  mediators  in  activating  CREB,  were 
expressed  and  activated  to  a  similar  degree  (Fig. 
5A,  pERK1/2,  104±6%  vs  wt,  p＞0.05;  pCaMKII, 
97±2%  vs  wt,  p＞0.05),  and  similarly  CREB  activat-
ion  was  not  different  between  two  groups  (Fig.  5A, 
pCREB,  106±3%  vs  wt,  p＞0.05).  Moreover,  the 
expression  of  BDNF  regulated  by  phosphorylated 
CREB  and  the  activation  of  TrkB,  a  receptor  for 
BDNF,  were  not  significantly  different 
in  both 

46 Byungwoo  Kim,  et  al.

groups  (Fig.  5A:  BDNF,  103±3%  vs.  wt,  p＞0.05; 
pTrkB,  106±5%  vs  wt,  p＞0.05),  which  is  consistent 
with  the  immunolabeling  of  each  marker  on  tissues, 
implying  that  neuronal  survival  and  the  survival 
signaling  is  not  affected  by  the  overexpression  of 
SRG3  in  mature  neurons.
    To  see  whether  the  expression  of  VEGF  and 
angiopoietin1  was  altered  by  the  overexpressed 
SRG3,  the  western  blotting  was  performed  with 
using  hippocampal  homogenates  from  each  geno-
type,  because  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor 
(VEGF)  and  angiopoietin1  are  all  angiogenesis- 
related  and  were  reported  to  be  linked  to  adult 
neurogenesis  (During  and  Cao,  2006;  Warner- 
Schmidt  et  al.,  2008).  Recently,  SRG3  has  been 
reported 
for  angiogenesis  and 
visceral  endoderm  development  in  the  yolk  sac,  and 
the  expression  of  angiogenesis-related  genes,  in-
cludeing  Angiopoietin1,  Tie2,  EphrinB2,  Ihh  and 

Notch1,  was  markedly  reduced  in  SRG3−/−Tg＋ 

required 

to  be 

the  subtle  change  of 

yolk  sacs  (Han  et  al.,  2008).  The  expression  of 
VEGF  and  angiopoietin1  was  not  different  in  both 
genotypes  (Fig.  5A:  VEGF,  104±3%  vs  wt,  p＞0.05; 
angiopoietin1,  102±3%  vs  wt,  p＞0.05),  unlike  the 
reduced  expression  of  angiogenesis  related  genes 
by  the  depletion  of  SRG3.
    To  overcome  the  possible  limitation  of  the  wes-
tern  blotting  missing 
the 
altered  expression  level  of  specific  molecules  which 
are  very  small  portion  of  the  whole  hippocampus, 
the  activation  or  expression  of  BDNF  and  CREB 
was  examined  by  immunofluorescent  and  immun-
operoxidase  staining  at  a  single  cell  level  (Fig.  5B, 
C).  BDNF  signal  was  not  strongly  detected  at 
somata  and  dendritic  arbors  of  hippocampal  neur-
ons  from  both  groups  and  rather  more  intensely 
observed  in  neurites  of  cortical  neurons  (Fig.  5B). 
The  phosphorylated  CREB  was  detected  in  nuclei 
of  cells  within  SGZ  and  across  cortical  layers  (Fig. 
6C).  Taken 
from 
western  blotting  and 
immunostaining  with  phos-
phorylated-CREB  and  BDNF  clearly  demonstrate 
that  overexpression  of  SRG3  makes  no  significant 
impact  on  the  expression  and  activation  of  intra-
cellular  signaling  molecules  involved  in  the  survival 
of  newborn  neurons  in  adult  hippocampus.

DISCUSSION

    TG  mice  overexpressing  SRG3  by  CaMKIIα 
promoter  only  in  neurons  of  forebrain  regions  such 
as  hippocampus  were  used  to  explore  the  role  of 
SRG3  protein,  a  core  subunit  of  SWI/SNF  chromat-
in  remodeling  complex,  in  adult  hippocampal  neuro-
genesis  in  vivo.  The  overall  results  demonstrated 
that  overexpression  of  SRG3  in  mature  neurons 
makes  no  significant  influence  on  the  entire  process 
of  adult  hippocampal  neurogenesis  including  pro-
liferation,  differentiation,  and  survival.
    BrdU  incorporation  assay  demonstrated  no  alter-
ation  in  the  proliferation  within  DG  of  SRG3  TG 
mice.  This  is  consistenly  supported  by  the  western 
blotting  analysis  showing  that  there  is  no  difference 
in  the  expression  level  of  neurogenic  factors  such 
as  VEGF  and  BDNF.  SRG3 
is  overexpressed 
specifically  in  postmitotic  neurons  so  that  its  direct 
influence  on  proliferating  cells  within  hippocampus 
might  not  be  accessed.  However,  this  might  not  be 
simply  unchanged  pattern  caused  by  SRG3  over-
expression.  The  transient  increase  in  the  number  of 
neuronal  cells  in  DG  of  SRG3  TG  mice  might  be 
compensated  by  subsequently  increaseed  cell  death 
and,  as  a  consequence,  the  total  number  of  early 
neuronal  marker-positive  cells  went  down 
to  a 
normal  level.  However,  TUNEL  assay  showed  that 
cell  death  level  was  also  not  changed  by  over-
expressed  SRG3  (data  not  shown),  and  gross  brain 
morphology  and  DAPI-coronal  section  staining 
showed  neither  brain  atrophy  nor  neuronal  loss, 
indicating  there  is  no  abnormal  ratio  in  cell  death  in 
SRG3  TG  mice.
    With  respect 
to  early  neuronal  differentiation 
during  adult  hippocampal  neurogenesis,  the  total 
numbers  and  expression  patterns  of  Dcx,  PSA- 
NCAM  and  Tuj-1  molecules  were  similar  between 
wt  and  SRG3  TG  mice.  This  might  be  because  the 
expression  of  early  neuronal  marker  proteins  such 
as  Dcx,  PSA-NCAM  precedes  the  CaMKIIα  ex-
pression  (Plumpe  et  al.,  2006;  Earnheart  et  al., 
2007).  Immunolabeling  with  MAP2  and  NeuN,  late 
neuronal  differentiation  markers,  also  showed  no 
difference  between  wt  and  SRG3  TG  mice  even 
though  NeuN＋ or  MAP2＋ cells  would  overexpress 
SRG3  protein  by  the  control  of  CaMKIIα promoter. 
It  might  imply  that  SRG3  overexpression  in  mature 

neurons  do  not  necessarily  affect  the  expression  of 
late  differentiation  markers.  In  this  point,  the  down-
regulated  level  of  SRG3  might  answer  the  issue 
how  SRG3  might  contribute  to  adult  hippocampal 
neurogenesis.
    It  may  be  argued  that  it  was  an  improper  choice 
for  studying  the  role  of  SRG3  in  newly  generated 
neurons,  because  CaMKIIα promoter  operates  only 
in  postmitotic  cells  committed  to  neurons.  However, 
some  reports  that  neural  stem/progenitor  cells  com-
municate  with  neighboring  cells 
like  endothelial 
cells,  microglia  or  astrocytes  in  a  neurogenic  niche 
(Ma  et  al.,  2005)  and  that  neurotrophic  or  angio-
genic  factors  act  in  a  paracrine  manner  (Emanueli 
et  al.,  2003)  suggest  a  possibility  that  the  over-
expression  of  SRG3  might  affect  the  generation  of 
neurons  in  adult  hippocampus.  Therefore,  it  might 
be  premature  to  conclude  that  SRG3  overexpress-
ion  has  no  significant  effect  on  adult  hippocampal 
neurogenesis.  Rather,  it  might  need  an  electro-
physiological  approach  or  exploration  at  the  synap-
tic 
to  detect  subtle  change  of  structural 
plasticity  possibly  induced  by  the  overexpression  of 
SRG3.
    In  summary,  the  present  study  demonstrates  that 
overexpressed  SRG3  in  hippocampal  neurons  has 
no  influence  on  the  entire  process  of  adult  hippo-
campal  neurogenesis  including  proliferation,  differ-
entiation,  and  survival  in  vivo.  However,  this  might 
not  mean  that  the  expression  level  of  SRG3  has 
nothing  to  do  with  the  adult  hippocampal  neuro-
genesis.  Though  the  overexpression  of  SRG3  has 
no  effect  on  the  generation  of  neurons  in  an  adult 
hippocampus,  the  study  with  the  reduced  level  of 
SRG3  or  conditional  knock-out  mice  would  provide 
interesting  information  to  understand  the  role  of 
SRG3  regarding  adult  hippocampal  neurogenesis.
