It has been recently reported that honey hydrogen peroxide in conjunction with unknown
honey components produced cytotoxic effects resulting in bacterial growth inhibition and
DNA degradation. The objective of this study was twofold: (a) to investigate whether the
coupling chemistry involving hydrogen peroxide is responsible for a generation of hydroxyl
radicals and (b) whether •OH generation affects growth of multi-drug resistant clinical
isolates. The susceptibility of ﬁve different strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) and four strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) iso-
lates from infected wounds to several honeys was evaluated using broth microdilution
assay. Isolates were identiﬁed to genus and species and their susceptibility to antibiotics
was conﬁrmed using an automated system (Vitek®, Biomérieux®). The presence of the
mec(A) gene, nuc gene and van(A) and (B) genes were conﬁrmed by polymerase chain
reaction. Results showed that no clinical isolate was resistant to selected active honeys.
The median difference in honeys MICs against these strains ranged between 12.5 and
6.25% v/v and was not different from the MIC against standard Escherichia coli and Bacil-
lus subtilis. Generation of •OH during bacteria incubation with honeys was analyzed using
3(cid:2)-(p-aminophenyl) ﬂuorescein (APF) as the •OH trap. The •OH participation in growth inhi-
bition was monitored directly by including APF in broth microdilution assay. The growth of
MRSA and VRE was inhibited by •OH generation in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure
of MRSA and VRE to honeys supplemented with Cu(II) augmented production of •OH by
30-fold and increased honey bacteriostatic potency from MIC90 6.25 to MIC90< 0.78%
v/v. Pretreatment of honeys with catalase prior to their supplementation with Cu ions fully
restored bacterial growth indicating that hydroxyl radicals were produced from H2O2 via
the Fenton-type reaction. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that bac-
teriostatic effect of honeys on MRSA and VRE was dose-dependently related to generation
of •OH from honey H2O2.

INTRODUCTION
Honey has well established function as an effective antibacterial
agent with a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria (for review, Lusby et al., 2002; Irish et al.,
2011). Despite a progress in identiﬁcation of compounds that are
involved in growth inhibitory and bactericidal actions of honey,
the mechanism underlying these activities remained unknown.
A functional relationship between hydrogen peroxide produced
in honey and antibacterial activity strongly pointed to H2O2 as
the main contributor to this activity (White et al., 1963; Bang
et al., 2003; Brudzynski, 2006). However, recent new ﬁndings ques-
tion this view. Firstly, molecular H2O2 is relatively weak oxidant
and it requires high concentrations to exert its cytotoxic effect
(Rutala et al., 2008; Finnegan et al., 2010). Our data indicate that
H2O2 content in honeys (0.4–2.6 mM), is much below its biocidal

levels. Yet, even at these low H2O2 concentrations, honeys effec-
tively inhibited bacterial growth and caused DNA strand breaks
(Brudzynski et al., 2011). Secondly, oxidative stress of endogenous
H2O2 was clearly augmented by the action of unknown honey
components (Brudzynski et al., 2011). Thirdly, in our accompa-
nying paper, we provided the ﬁrst evidence that honeys of high
bacteriostatic activity (MIC90 12.5–6.25% v/v) possessed signif-
icantly higher levels of phenolic compounds of higher radical
scavenging activities than honey of the average bacteriostatic activ-
ity (MIC90 25% v/v), thus suggesting the involvement of phenolics
and H2O2 in bacterial growth inhibition (Brudzynski et al., 2012).
In our prior research, we have screened over 200 samples of
Canadian honeys of different botanical origin for the antibacter-
ial activity using broth microdilution assay (Brudzynski and Kim,
2011). Fifty percent of screened honeys showed MICs exceeding

that of sugar solution. Among the group of “active” honeys, MICs
of honeys originating from buckwheat differed consistently by four
to 16 doubling concentrations from the MIC of sugar solution.
Canadian buckwheat honeys characteristically contained higher
amounts of hydrogen peroxide than other honeys (Brudzynski,
2006) and possessed higher than average content of polyphenols
of high antioxidant activity as measured by the oxygen radical
absorbent capacity (ORAC) method (Brudzynski and Miotto,
2011; Brudzynski et al., 2012). These results have converged to
recognize that the coupling chemistry between H2O2 and polyphe-
nols, rather than hydrogen peroxide alone, may exert oxida-
tive effect causing bacterial growth arrest and DNA degradation
(Brudzynski et al., 2011, 2012). High ORAC values of polyphenols
are usually indicative of their efﬁcient peroxyl radical scavenging
abilities (Cao et al., 1997; Price et al., 2006). However, the same
polyphenols could become powerful pro-oxidants when oxidized
in the presence of oxygen from air. Such situation occurs during
honey harvesting from the comb and during storage. Oxidized
polyphenols further generate hydrogen peroxide and in the pres-
ence of transition metals such as Cu(I) or Fe(II) they drive the
generation of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2 via the Fenton reac-
tion (Puppo, 1992; Hanasaki et al., 1994; Cao et al., 1997; Sakihama
et al., 2002).

•

Together, these facts brought about a new hypothesis that the
oxidizing action of honey on bacterial cells may result from the
generation of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2. Such coupling reac-
tion has never been shown to be associated with honey function
in spite of the fact that honey possesses all necessary substrates for
the Fenton reaction; H2O2, polyphenols as well as transition metal
ions (Bogdanov et al., 2007).

•

•

In contrast to H2O2,

OH radicals are powerful oxidants that
can oxidize molecules in all cellular compartments in a non-
speciﬁc manner.
OH cytotoxic effects have been shown for both
prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; bacteria, yeast, and human cells
(Halliwell et al., 1985; Imlay and Linn, 1988; Perrone et al., 2008).
For example,
OH production from H2O2 by neutrophil granules
is a ﬁrst line of defense against bacteria during acute inﬂammation.
Similarly, the H2O2-induced injury in Escherichia coli appears to
be mediated by
OH via Fenton reaction (Imlay and Linn, 1988;
Imlay et al., 1988; Gutteridge et al., 1998). In the Fenton reaction
in vivo, H2O2 is reduced to
OH radicals in the presence of fer-
rous (Fe II) or cuprous (Cu II) ions, according to the equation
Men + H2O2 = Men+1 + •
. Importantly however, the
efﬁciency of this reaction increases dramatically in the presence of
polyphenols (Cao et al., 1997; Sakihama et al., 2002).

Therefore, it appeared likely to us that hydroxyl radicals gener-
ated from hydrogen peroxide in the Fenton reaction rather than
H2O2 are main cytotoxic agents that underlie honey antibac-
terial activity. However, there was no direct experimental evi-
dence that (a) honey can generate hydroxyl radicals from H2O2
OHs were responsible for bacterial
and (b) that H2O2-derived
(cid:2)
growth and survival. In this study, we took advantage of 3
-(p-
aminophenyl) ﬂuorescein (APF) as
OH trap to investigate gener-
ation of hydroxyl radicals during exposure of bacterial cultures to
honey.

•

•

Since H2O2 is a common component in honeys, a byproduct of
glucose oxidation by honeybee glucose oxidase, we also explored a

possibility that generation of hydroxyl radicals from honey hydro-
gen peroxide represents a general mechanism by which honey
affects bacterial growth. In support of such notion are the fol-
lowing facts: (a) honeys from different botanical and geographical
origins have been shown to possess antibacterial activity and (b)
at least in some honeys, this activity has been shown to be directed
against both antibiotic-sensitive as well as multi-resistant bacteria.
This putative mechanism against antibiotic-resistant bacteria may
function in honeys derived from Leptospermum spp., (manuka),
Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat), Koompassia excelsa (tualang),
and honeydew honeys (Willix et al., 1992; Cooper et al., 2000,
2002a,b; French et al., 2005; Brudzynski and Lannigan, 2008; Blair
et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2009; Majtan et al., 2010).

To provide a better insight into the involvement of hydroxyl
radicals on bacterial growth, we have chosen several clinical iso-
lates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and monitored
simultaneously their growth (by absorbance) and
OH generation
(by ﬂuorescence) upon their incubation with active honeys. If the
•
OH generation proves to be implicated in the growth inhibition
of standard bacteria (E. coli and Bacillus subtilis) as well as MRSA
and VRE, then perhaps it could be concluded that honey action
resembles that of antibiotics. In the latter case, the oxidative dam-
age evoked by hydroxyl radicals has been suggested as a common
mechanism for antibiotic-mediated cell death (Gutteridge et al.,
1998; Kohanski et al., 2010).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
HONEYS
Honeys were donated by beekeepers and included both commer-
cial (pasteurized) and apiary (raw) samples. The list of honeys,
their plant origin main physico-chemical characteristics is given
in Table 1.

BACTERIAL STRAINS
Standard strains of B. subtilis (ATCC 6633) and E. coli (ATCC
14948) purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Remel Products
(Lenexa, KS 66215, USA) were grown in Mueller–Hinton Broth
(MHB; Difco Laboratories) overnight in a shaking water bath at
37˚C. Overnight cultures were diluted with broth to the equivalent
of the 0.5 McFarland Standard.

Clinical isolates were obtained from the Clinical Microbiol-
ogy Laboratory of the London Health Science Centre, London,
ON, Canada, three strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus
faecium and four strains of MRSA. On receipt these were sub-
cultured from swabs onto Mueller–Hinton II agar (Difco Labo-
ratories). Originally the organisms were isolated and processed at
the Department of Clinical Microbiology of the London Health
Science Centres. An automated system (Vitek®, Biomérieux®) was
used to identify bacterial isolates to genus and species and their
susceptibility to antibiotics (Table 2 and 3).

IDENTIFICATION OF CLINICAL ISOLATES AND CONFIRMATION OF
ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE
Isolates were identiﬁed to genus and species and their susceptibility
to antibiotics was conﬁrmed using an automated system (Vitek®,
Biomérieux®). The presence of the mec (A) gene, nuc gene, and van

This work was conducted by the Clinical Microbiology Labo-

ratory, London Health Sciences Centre, London, ON, Canada.

Reproducibility for each strain was determined at minimum
two experiments and maximum three conducted in triplicate.
MIC was determined by using a protocol as described in Meth-
ods according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory
Standards (NCCLS, 1996).

The overnight cultures of each strain were diluted in MHB to

obtain 108 cfu/ml using a 0.5 McFarland standard.

POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION
The procedure for identiﬁcation and conﬁrmation for both MRSA
and VRE were as follows: Nasal and perineal swabs were inoc-
ulated onto chromogenic media designed to identify possible
MRSA and VRE isolates (Colorex VRE, Alere, Inc., London, ON,
Canada; MRSASelectTM, Bio-Rad Redmond, WA, USA). Colonies
suspected of being MRSA or VRE were conﬁrmed using PCR. For
MRSA conﬁrmation the organism was assayed for the presence of
the mec (A) gene and nuclease. Suspected VRE were assayed for

PCR was run according to a standard protocol that is used

ANTIBACTERIAL ASSAY
The antibacterial activity of honeys was performed using a broth
microdilution assay in sterile, 96-well microplates (Costar, Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Canada) in compliance with requirements of
NCCLS (1996). Wells in rows B to G contained 110 μl of inoculated
broth (106 cfu/ml ﬁnal concentrations for each of microorgan-
isms). Wells in row A were ﬁlled with 200 μl of 50% solution of
honey in sterile water and were inoculated with 20 μl of 107 cfu/ml
of bacterial culture. Serial twofold dilutions of honey were pre-
pared by mixing and transferring 110 μl of honey with 110 μl
of inoculated broth from row A to row H of a microplate. Row
G contained only inoculum and served as a positive control and
row H contained sterile MHB and served as a blank. In a single
experiment, each honey was tested in triplicate.

After overnight incubation of plates at 37˚C in a shaking water
bath, bacterial growth was measured at A595 nm using the Syn-
ergy HT multidetection microplate reader (Synergy HT, Bio-Tek
Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).

The contribution of color of honeys to the absorption was cor-
rected by subtracting the absorbance of wells before (zero time)
and after overnight incubation.

Statistical analysis and dose–response curves were obtained
using K4 software provided by Synergy HT, Bio-Tek Instruments,
Winooski, VT, USA.

DETERMINATION OF MICs
The absorbance readings obtained from the dose–response curve
were used to construct growth inhibition proﬁles (GIPs). The min-
imal inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) were determined from the
GIPs curves and represented the lowest concentration of the hon-
eys that inhibited the bacterial growth by 90% as measured by the
absorbance at A595 nm.

QC/QA controls: estimation of the MICs was conducted
only then when control bacterial strains in microdilution assay
(row G) show sufﬁcient growth. For each bacterial strain, 3–6
MICs were established in independent experiments. The obtained
median MICs were the same or differed by± one doubling
concentration.

HYDROXY-RADICALS MEASUREMENTS
(cid:2)
-(p-Aminophenyl) ﬂuorescein (APF; Invitrogen, Canada) was
3
used for the detection of hydroxyl radicals produced by honeys. A
broth microdilution assay in 96-well microplate format containing
inoculum and twofold serially diluted honeys was adapted to assess
both hydroxyl radicals generated and bacterial growth. To each well
the APF solution was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 μM (in
50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). The experimental
wells (containing bacterial inoculum and honey dilutions) as well
as the assay controls (bacterial inoculum) were supplemented with
10 μM APF while the negative control consisted of experimental
wells without APF.

Plates were incubated in a shaking water bath at 37˚C for
18 h. The plates were analyzed for both, bacterial growth using
absorbance at A595 nm and hydroxyl radical generation using ﬂu-
orescence excitation and emission wavelengths at 490 and 520 nm,
respectively.

To measure hydroxyl radical generation in the presence of Cu
ions, honeys were incubated with 400 μM of CuCl2 dissolved in
50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.

HYDROGEN PEROXIDE ASSAY
The hydrogen peroxide concentrations of the honeys were deter-
mined using the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay
Kit in 96-well microplate format according to the manufac-
turer manual (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Burlington, ON,
Canada) and as described previously (Brudzynski et al., 2011).
The Synergy HT multidetection microplate reader was used to
measure the ﬂuorescence formed during the reaction of honey’s
hydrogen peroxide with the Amplex Red reagent (10-acetyl-3,7-
dihydroxyphenoxasine). The measurements were conducted at an
emission wavelength of 590 nm, and an excitation wavelength of
530 nm. The standard curve constructed from the known con-
centration of H2O2 was used to calculate the hydrogen peroxide
concentrations of the honeys. Each of the honey samples, and the
standard curve, were tested in triplicate.

CATALASE-TREATMENT OF HONEYS
Honey were treated with catalase (13 800 U/mg solid; Sigma-
Aldrich, Canada) at ratio of 1000 units per 1 ml of 50% honey
solution in sterile water for 2 h at room temperature.

RESULTS
BACTERIOSTATIC EFFECT OF HONEY AGAINST ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT
CLINICAL ISOLATES
From a large pool of over 200 honeys screened for their bacte-
riostatic activity against E. coli and B. subtilis (Brudzynski and
Kim, 2011), we selected eleven honeys that showed MIC90 exceed-
ing those of sugar solution (artiﬁcial honey). The list included six
buckwheat honeys (H23, 58, 76, 77, 81, and 103), one clover honey
(H11) and one blueberry honey (H15). The MIC90 of these hon-
eys ranged from 6.25 to 12.5% (v/v), with exception of H15, with
MIC90 of 25% (v/v). New Zealand Active Manuka honey (MIC90
6.25% v/v) was used as a reference (Figure 1).

These honeys were analyzed for their ability to inhibit growth
of two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, VRE 0 and VRE
2 and three strains of MRSA, MRSA 3, 4, and 5. Figure 1 shows

Mechanism of honey bacteriostatic action

Despite the multi-resistance pattern to antibiotics (Table 2),
supported by a positive identiﬁcation of the antibiotic-resistant
genes (Table 3), all strains of MRSA and VRE were sensitive to
honey bacteriostatic action (Figures 1 and 2). This observation
together with the lack of signiﬁcant differences in susceptibility
between the antibiotic-resistant and standard bacteria suggested
that bacteriostatic action of honey may proceeds via a common
mechanism.

FIGURE 1 | Bacteriostatic activity of eleven honey varieties against two
clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains,
VRE 0 and VRE 2. Reproducibility for each strain was determined at
minimum in three separate experiments conducted in triplicate.

DETECTION OF HYDROXYL RADICAL FORMATION FOLLOWING
INCUBATION OF MRSA AND VRE WITH HONEYS
In our most recent study, we have shown that hydrogen peroxide
is implicated in bacterial growth inhibition but its inhibitory efﬁ-
ciency was modulated by unknown honey components (Brudzyn-
ski et al., 2011). We hypothesized that the formation of
OH
from H2O2 rather than H2O2 itself may be directly implicated
in bacterial growth inhibition.

•

To investigate the generation of

-(p-aminophenyl) ﬂuorescein (APF) as

OH from honey’s hydrogen
peroxide and its effect on bacterial growth, we exposed MRSA
and VRE culture to serially diluted honeys in the presence of
(cid:2)
3
OH trap (Setsukinai
et al., 2003). APF is a non-ﬂuorescent product but in the pres-
ence of
OH it became oxidized to a ﬂuorescent form. It has been
shown that, the
OH trapping by APF resulted in a dose-dependent
increase in the ﬂuorescence (Setsukinai et al., 2003).

that both VRE strains were susceptible to honeys. The median dif-
ferences in honeys bacteriostatic activity varied only by twofold
from the low MIC to the high MIC for each strains (MIC90
6.25 and 12.5% (v/v), respectively), with exception of honey H15.
Both VRE strains displayed the same multi-drug resistant pattern
(Table 2). There was no difference in MIC values of honeys against
multi-drug resistant VRE strains and E. coli (Figure 1).

On the other hand, the susceptibility of the three strains of
MRSA to honeys differed two- to four-fold ranging from MIC90
6.25–25% (v/v). MRSA 4 was the most resistant strain while MRSA
3 and 5 were more susceptible to different honeys. MRSA 4 was
more resistant to honey action than B. subtilis (Figure 2).

The antibiograms performed on MRSA and VRE strains
showed similar multi-resistance proﬁles to several classes of
antibiotics (Table 2).

CONFIRMATION OF THE PRESENCE OF RESISTANCE GENES IN
CLINICAL ISOLATES
These pathogens isolated from wounds were identiﬁed to the genus
and species using the automated system Vitek II, Biomerieux.
The presence or absence of antibiotic resistance genes [van(A),
van(B), mec(A), and nuc] was conﬁrmed by the polymerase chain
reaction. The presence of penicillin-binding protein (PBP2
) in
the Staphylococcus aureus strains were conﬁrmed using an Oxoid
agglutination kit.

(cid:2)

Two new bacterial strains, MRSA 6 andVRE 3 were exposed sep-
arately to ﬁve freshly obtained buckwheat honeys: H203, 204, 205,
and 206. The incubation of each honey with MRSA 6 and VRE 3
cultures resulted with steady accumulation of hydroxyl radicals up
to the 16× honey dilution, as assessed by increase in ﬂuorescence
(Figures 3A,B). The peak of
OH generation corresponded to the
MIC of honey. Further honey dilutions resulted in a decrease of
•
OH levels and concomitant loss of growth inhibition. Thus, there
was a causal relationship between
OH generation and bacterial
growth inhibition.

•

•

No major differences were observed in the growth inhibition
patterns between the six honeys; neither in the ﬁnal MIC values
against MRSA 6 and VRE 3 nor in the levels of

The relationship between honey dilutions and hydroxyl radical
production was strongly reminiscent of that between honey dilu-
tions and hydrogen peroxide production (Brudzynski et al., 2011).
Previous studies have established that honey dilutions facilitate the
production of endogenous H2O2 by glucose oxidase (White et al.,
1963; Bang et al., 2003; Brudzynski et al., 2011). In most of our
test honeys, a steady increase in H2O2 content with honey dilution
was observed, reaching the peak of production between 4× and
16× dilution and declining thereafter (Brudzynski et al., 2011).

graphically, it appeared that there was a linear relation between
OH concentrations and honey dilution. Figure 4

(median H2O2 content of 0.8 mM) and 32-fold dilution for hon-
eys H77 and H76 (median H2O2 content of 2.63 mM, Table 1).
This ﬁnding suggested that honey dilutions, the increased produc-
tion of H2O2, and increased generation of
OH are interdependent
phenomena.

•

•

The results conﬁrmed that upon addition of Cu ions to hon-
eys the generation of
OH radicals from H2O2 was substantially
enhanced (Figure 5). Approximately 30-fold higher level of
OH
was observed in the presence of Cu ions compared to control hon-
eys. Similarly to results presented in Figure 4, a curve of
OH
radical generated under these conditions was essentially linear up
to 32-fold dilution. These data indicate that Cu ions facilitated
decomposition of H2O2 to generate
OH, as expected from the
classical Fenton reaction.

EFFECT OF CU IONS AND CATALASE ON THE HYDROXYL RADICAL

Hydroxyl radicals are generated as a result of the coupling chem-
istry between hydrogen peroxide and metal ions Fe(II) or Cu(II)
via Fenton reaction. To test whether the Fenton reaction is

The increased levels of H2O2 decomposition and hydroxyl
radical generation in the presence of Cu ions dramatically aug-
mented honey bacteriostatic potency. When honeys H77 and
H76 supplemented with Cu ions were incubated with MRSA 6
cells, the bacterial growth was inhibited beyond 128-fold honey
dilution, increasing honey MIC < 0.78% v/v (Figure 6). The direct

connection between the increase in
OH generation and the
increase in growth inhibition of MRSA by honey supplemented
with Cu is consistent with the conclusion that hydroxyl radicals
are primarily responsible for this cytotoxic effect.

•

To demonstrate that honey H2O2 is a substrate in the genera-
tion of hydroxyl radicals in these experiments, we ﬁrst pre-treated
honeys H77 and H76 with catalase to remove H2O2 and then sup-
plemented them with Cu ions. Addition of catalase completely
abolished inhibitory action of honey and bacterial growth was
fully restored. In the same time, the
OH generation was reduced
to 0 in catalase-treated honeys (Figure 6).
•

Together, these results indicate that

OH radicals were gener-
ated from the honey endogenous H2O2 via the Fenton reaction.
The
OH radical exerted dose-dependent inhibitory effect on
MRSA and VRE growth.

DISCUSSION
(cid:2)
In this study, the 3
OH trap
technique was used to provide direct evidence that hydroxyl rad-
ical generation from honey hydrogen peroxide caused inhibition
of growth of multi-drug resistant clinical isolates of MRSA and
VRE, as well as growth of standard bacteria, E. coli and B. subtilis.
Application of APF allowed us to measure simultaneously (in the
same experiment) the generation of hydroxyl radicals and their
effects on growth of MRSA and VRE cells.

(cid:2)

Firstly, we have established that the antibiotic-resistant clinical
isolates, VRE 0 and VRE 2, carrying vancomycin-resistance genes
van(A) and MRSA 3, 4, and 5 carrying mec(A) and PBP2
genes, all
were sensitive to honey actions. The variability in honeys median
MICs against MRSA and VRE were comparable to those against
E. coli and B. subtilis and ranged from 6.25 to 12.5% v/v. Similar
results have been previously obtained for honeys of Leptospermum
origin, (manuka; Willix et al., 1992; Cooper et al., 2000, 2002a,b;
French et al., 2005; Blair et al., 2009), K. excelsa (tualang; Tan et al.,
2009), and F. esculentum (buckwheat; Brudzynski and Lannigan,
2008).

The presence of several antibiotic resistance genes therefore,
did not interfere with the honey action against these microorgan-
isms, providing an important clue that the underlying mechanism
may concern a common biochemical pathway affecting all bac-
teria. The observed slight variability in susceptibility of different
MRSA to honey may be a reﬂection of their ability to counteract
the oxidative stress.

Secondly, exposure of MRSA and VRE to tested honeys resulted
in a steady accumulation of hydroxyl radicals, as evidenced by
increased ﬂuorescence of APF, reaching the peak between 16-
and 32-fold honey dilution. The dilution of honey at which the
maximal
OH generation was observed corresponded to honey
MIC. After reaching this culmination point, both hydroxyl radical
generation and growth inhibition showed a decline, indicating a
functional interplay between these two events.

•

The relationship between generation of

OH and the extent of
growth inhibition strongly resembled the relationship between the
production of H2O2 upon honey dilution and inhibition of bacte-
rial growth (Brudzynski et al., 2011). This observation implied that
honey H2O2 might be a main source of
OH radicals. A generally
accepted mechanism of
OH generation is the Fenton reaction in
•
which H2O2 is reduced to
OH in the presence of transition metal

ions (Puppo, 1992; Hanasaki et al., 1994; Cao et al., 1997; Urbanski
and Ber¸esewicz, 2000). Honey is naturally enriched in transition
metals such as Fe(II) or Cu(II) (Bogdanov et al., 2007) and pro-
duces its own H2O2, thus fulﬁlling requirements for the Fenton
–type reaction to occur. Consistently with this premise, supple-
mentation of honey with Cu(II) caused a remarkable increase in
•
OH production. This increase was completely abolished by pre-
treatment of honey with catalase prior to addition of Cu ions,
clearly indicating that honey H2O2 was a source from which of
•
OH radicals were generated. A coupling chemistry via the Fen-
ton reaction is then the most plausible mechanism operating in
honey since, similarly to results observed here, removal of H2O2
or chelation of metal ions prevented hydroxyl radical generation
in Fenton reaction (Puppo, 1992; Ali and Konishi, 1998; Urbanski
and Ber¸esewicz, 2000).

Furthermore, a tight functional relationship was observed
between levels of hydroxyl radicals produced and honey bacterio-
static potency. We observed that MICs of honeys increased from
6.25% v/v to less than 0.78%v/v (below 128-fold dilution) after
Cu-supplementation. Again, this augmented bacteriostatic activity
was catalase-sensitive: removal of H2O2, which in turn abolished
•
OH generation, resulted in the full restoration of bacterial growth.
These results indicate that the oxidative stress caused by honey
action on bacterial cells resulted from hydroxyl radical gener-
ated from honey’s hydrogen peroxide rather than from the action
of molecular H2O2 itself. The formed hydroxyl radicals inhib-
ited the growth of MRSA and VRE in a dose-dependent manner.
Thus, we established here a functional link between the genera-
tion of hydroxyl radicals from honey H2O2 and bacterial growth
inhibition.

There is a tremendous need for novel antibacterial agents to
treat infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Honey,
with its long history of usage as an antibacterial agent in tra-
ditional and folk medicine (for review, Lusby et al., 2002), has
recently brought renewed attention of researchers working in
the area of drug discovery and development. Accumulated evi-
dence from basic research and clinical trials allowed manuka
honey (derived from Leptospermum species) to be recognized
as a therapeutic agent. Its antibacterial effectiveness in wound
healing has been documented in many case studies and random-
ized controlled trials (for review, Molan, 2006). As the result, at
least two types of formulations based on manuka honey, Medi-
honey™and Active Honey Absorbent Dressing, API-MED™have
been approved to be used in clinical treatments of infected
wounds.

One of the principle limitations of many antibacterial agents
derived from natural products, including honey, is lack of knowl-
edge about a molecular mechanism that lead to bacterial cell death.
In this context, our ﬁnding that hydroxyl radicals generated by
honeys (other than manuka honey) underlie its antibacterial activ-
ity may be critical for designing effective antibacterial therapy for
the following reasons: (a) generation of hydroxyl radical is a com-
mon property of honeys of European and North American origin,
(b) the hydroxyl radical-based mechanism of honey action did not
discriminate between antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant
bacteria, and (c) hydroxyl radical levels generated by honey could
serve as a diagnostic tool to predicted antibacterial efﬁcacy of
honeys in clinical applications.
