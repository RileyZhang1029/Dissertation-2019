Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have been associated with increased severity of periodontal disease for many
years. More recently, the impact of periodontal disease on glycaemic control has been investigated. The role of
the oral microbiota in this two-way relationship is at this stage unknown. Further studies, of a longitudinal
nature and investigating a wider array of bacterial species, are required in order to conclusively determine if
there is a difference in the oral microbiota of diabetics and non-diabetics and whether this difference accounts,
on the one hand, for the increased severity of periodontal disease and on the other for the poorer glycaemic
control seen in diabetics.

that

Diabetes and periodontitis are both complex

chronic diseases for which there is substantial
evidence for a bidirectional relationship. There is
clear evidence that diabetics have an increased prevalence
and severity of periodontitis. There is also evidence to
suggest
individuals with periodontitis have an
increased prevalence of diabetes, and that diabetics with
periodontitis have poorer glycaemic control. The pre-
valence of diabetes is growing rapidly worldwide, espe-
cially in developing nations that are undergoing rapid
urbanisation. It has been estimated that in the year 2000,
171 million people worldwide suffered from diabetes and
that this will increase to 366 million by 2030 (1).

Classic diabetic complications include microangiopa-
thy, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and acceler-
ated atherosclerosis. In combination with the systemic
complications, there are often oral manifestations and
complications that include xerostomia, mucosal diseases
such as recurrent aphthous ulceration, as well as burning
mouth syndrome (2). Xerostomia is likely to result from
depletion of extracellular fluids as a result of polyuria
and may predispose to further oral complications such as
dental caries, mucosal infections, and difficulty masticat-
ing. Periodontitis has been described as the ‘sixth
complication of diabetes’ (3). These complications result
from metabolic derangements, especially hyperglycaemia.
An increase in the prevalence and severity of period-
ontitis has been observed in diabetics (4, 5) and has been
confirmed in a recent meta-analysis of 23 studies (5). In

type 1 diabetics, an increase in the severity of periodontal
diseases has been shown across most age ranges. The
strength of this association appears to vary with age. Age
itself has been shown to be a risk factor for periodontitis
(6), and is likely to be a confounder in studies investigat-
ing the link. A study of type 1 diabetics aged 1925 years
showed no differences between diabetics and non-dia-
betics in terms of oral hygiene status; however, the
diabetic group did show higher frequencies of inflamed
buccal/lingual gingiva and gingival recession, which
suggests an altered inflammatory response to plaque
(7). In a larger study, approximately 10% of type 1
diabetics aged between 13 and 18 years had periodontitis,
compared with only 1.7% of non-diabetics (8). More
extensive and severe periodontitis was observed in 4049
year olds with long-standing insulin-dependent diabetes
(25.699.8 years)
than in non-diabetic controls (9).
However, no statistically significant differences were
noted between diabetics and non-diabetics aged 5059
or 6069 years. In fact, alveolar bone loss was not
significantly different between diabetics aged 4049 years
and 6069 years. It appears that the age of onset of
diabetes and duration of disease may be factors as the
older age group in this study had a shorter average
disease duration (18.6911.2 years).

Type 2 diabetes has also been shown to be a risk factor
for periodontal diseases. This relationship is most clearly
demonstrated in the Pima Indian population of Arizona.
This population has the world’s highest incidence and

prevalence of type 2 diabetes. A study of the association
between diabetic status and periodontal conditions in
1,342 individuals showed an increased risk for period-
ontitis with an odds ratio of 3.43 (95% CI 2.285.16) for
alveolar bone loss, after adjusting for demographic
variables and several oral health indices including the
plaque index (10). It was further demonstrated in a 2-year
longitudinal study that, in the Pima Indian population,
type 2 diabetics had increased progression of alveolar
bone loss (11).

The degree of metabolic control by diabetic patients is
likely to influence susceptibility to periodontitis, as it is
hyperglycaemia that leads to the characteristic complica-
tions of diabetes. Tervonen and Oliver (12) demonstrated
this in a cross-sectional study into the association
between long-term diabetic control and periodontal
status. Diabetics were assessed using HbA1c and for
plaque, calculus, probing depth, and attachment loss.
Based on their control of blood glucose levels, they were
grouped into ‘good control’,
‘moderate control’, and
‘poor control’ of blood glucose levels. It was found that
the prevalence of severe attachment loss increased with
decreasing control of diabetes. This study found that 10%
of well controlled and 27% of poorly controlled diabetics
had loss of attachment greater than 5 mm (12). These
findings have been confirmed by other studies  both
cross-sectional (13) and longitudinal (14, 15).

A meta-analysis of 18 cross-sectional, three prospective
cohort, and two clinical
trials confirms the overall
conclusion that diabetics have significantly higher sever-
ity and prevalence of periodontitis (5). The gingival index
and bleeding index were not significantly different among
diabetics versus non-diabetics. However,
the overall
difference in average probing depths and attachment
loss was significantly greater in diabetics.

The role of plaque in periodontal disease
The causal role of dental plaque in gingivitis was clearly
demonstrated in the landmark experimental gingivitis
study of Loe et al. (16). For obvious ethical reasons, such
a clear cause and effect relationship has not, as yet, been
established for chronic periodontitis in humans. Never-
theless, an overwhelming weight of circumstantial evi-
dence exists showing that if there is no plaque, there is no
disease (1719). This strongly indicates a causal role for
the bacteria within the plaque. Over the past two decades,
however, it has become apparent that it is the nature of
the host response to plaque that determines loss of
periodontal attachment and alveolar bone (20). In this
context it can be seen that periodontal disease progres-
sion results from both bacterial virulence factors as well
as host inflammatory mechanisms.

Despite widespread acceptance of the specific plaque
hypothesis (21) in the etiology of chronic periodon-
titis, periodontal pathogens are frequently detected in

that

periodontally healthy individuals (22). Nevertheless, once
formed, deep periodontal pockets could provide a
suitable environment
further selects for specific
anaerobic bacterial complexes (23). Factors that alter
this subgingival environment,
including inflammation
and the myriad of cytokines and mediators produced,
could therefore influence the composition of the sub-
gingival biofilm. In this context, factors such as diabetes
that alter the nature of the immune/inflammatory re-
sponse could conceivably influence which bacterial com-
plexes form subgingivally. At this stage, however, the
effect of diabetes on the composition of the subgingival
plaque is unclear. While certain bacterial species are more
commonly found in diabetic patients, it is more difficult
to determine whether this occurs because of direct
alterations
to the subgingival microenvironment or
whether it occurs indirectly by alterations to the host
response. Diabetic individuals may be more susceptible to
chronic periodontitis as a result of hyperglycaemia
altering the subgingival microenvironment such that
bacterial species that are more pathogenic in nature will
become dominant. Alternatively, diabetes may alter
the host response to plaque resulting in more tissue
destruction.

Effect of diabetes on the subgingival microbiota
Several studies have investigated the composition of
plaque in diabetics compared with non-diabetics. In-
creased numbers of so-called periodontal pathogens
have been isolated from periodontal pockets of diabetic
patients (24, 25), although the specific differences in the
microbiota of diabetics compared with non-diabetics is
not clear. Thorstensson et al. observed significantly
greater numbers of Porphyromonas gingivalis in diabetics
compared to controls, although no differences were seen
with Actinobacillus (Aggregatibacter) actinomycetemco-
mitans, Campylobacter
rectus, Capnocytophaga spp.,
Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Pre-
votella intermedia (26). Other studies,
including long-
itudinal studies found no such association (2730). More
recently, the periodontal microbiota of diabetics and non-
diabetics was compared using checkerboard DNADNA
hybridisation. Of the 17 species tested for, Treponema
denticola, Streptococcus sanguinis, Prevotella nigrescens,
intermedius, and Streptococcus oralis
Staphylococcus
levels were elevated in the supragingival plaque of
diabetics compared with non-diabetics, although no
significant differences were found in subgingival plaque
samples (31). Subgingival infection patterns were also
found to be similar in type 1 diabetics and non-diabetic
controls of comparable periodontal

non-diabetics (33). A higher prevalence of P. gingivalis
was also demonstrated in type 2 diabetics compared with
non-diabetic controls using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) (34). Further, P. gingivalis with the Type II fim A
gene, a more virulent clone, was associated with more
extensive periodontitis in type 2 diabetics (35).

immunoglobulins,

The subgingival microenvironment is determined, in
part, by the composition of gingival crevicular fluid
(GCF) and, in part, by the composition of the subgingi-
val microbiota itself. The GCF is a serum product, which
also contains all of the components of an inflammatory
exudate including complement,
in-
flammatory mediators, and immune cells. The flow of
GCF rapidly increases with the onset of inflammation
(36). This has the potential to alter the subgingival
microenvironment and the nature of the microbiota that
reside within it (37). During the pathogenesis of gingivitis
and periodontitis, the ecology of the subgingival micro-
environment changes from one in which there is a shallow
sulcus and minimal flow of GCF where Gram-positive
facultative anaerobic cocci and rods predominate, to one
in which there is a deepened pocket with an increased
supply of nutrients from GCF where predominantly
anaerobic and pathogenic species predominate in the

biofilm. While a similar shift
expected in diabetic periodontal patients,
there may
indeed be differences in the subgingival microenviron-
ment in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetics.

The glucose content of GCF in diabetics has been
shown to be elevated compared with non-diabetics (38).
This could provide an altered source of nutrition for
subgingival microorganisms and subsequently modify the
proportions of
certain species within the biofilm.
Furthermore, the immune response to periodontal patho-
gens may be altered or impeded in diabetics, which could
lead to the overgrowth of certain species. Advances in the
understanding of biofilms indicate that there is a highly
complex interplay between many different species with
certain, more virulent, organisms tending to coaggregate
(39, 40). At this stage however, further studies of a
longitudinal nature and investigating a wider array of
bacterial species are required in order to conclusively
determine if there is a difference in the biofilm of
diabetics and non-diabetics.

Effect of diabetes on the host response
Collagen is the most abundant protein in the animal
kingdom and provides structure to all periodontal tissue
components including gingiva, periodontal
ligament,
cementum and alveolar bone, as well as blood vessels.
Connective tissue metabolism in diabetics is altered in
comparison to non-diabetics. Diabetes and hyperglycae-
mia may, through its effect on collagen metabolism, tissue
homeostasis, and wound healing, play a role in greater
loss of attachment. Hyperglycaemia has the potential to

Diabetes and the oral microbiota

cause alterations to the structure of collagen and disrupt
its synthesis, modifying the course or nature of period-
ontal diseases. Willershausen-Zonnchen et al. demon-
strated a dose-dependent reduction in collagen and
glycosaminoglycan synthesis,
the two most common
components of
in cultured
human gingival fibroblasts as a result of elevated glucose
concentrations (41). Alterations to these components
reduce the capacity of connective tissue to remodel and
so can affect the progression of periodontal diseases.

the extracellular matrix,

Hyperglycaemia in diabetes

is known to induce
changes in collagen via advanced glycation end products
(AGEs) (42). Collagen molecules become cross-linked via
stable bonds, which cause the collagen to become less
soluble, less susceptible to proteolytic enzymes, and more
rigid (43). While this may not appear to be to the
detriment of the attachment apparatus, these effects
are noted in the vasculature of the periodontium with
signs of microangiopathy that are characteristic of
diabetes. Several studies have documented significant
increases in the thickness of the basement membrane of
gingival capillaries (44, 45). Frantzis et al. in an electron
microscopy study noted that capillary basement mem-
branes of diabetic periodontal patients were approxi-
mately four times thicker than those of non-diabetic
periodontal and non-periodontal patients (44). Listgarten
et al. made similar observations (45).

zinc-dependent

On the other hand, altered tissue homeostasis in
diabetics may occur via a potential increase in collagen
degradation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a
family of
endopeptidases with the
primary purpose of degradation of
the extracellular
matrix (46). Collagenases are a subclass of matrix
metalloproteinases that cleave collagen molecules, en-
abling them to become denatured, further degraded,
and phagocytosed. Collagenases are known to be
increased in the periodontium of diabetics (47). These
increases in collagenases may be reversed with good
glycaemic control (48).

The alterations in connective tissue metabolism that
have been observed in diabetics, with an increase in
collagenase production, along with well established
microangiopathic effects are likely to be important
factors in the pathogenesis of periodontitis as a diabetic
complication. These alterations are likely to not only
reduce the health of these tissues but also inhibit wound
healing such that
tissues are more
susceptible
resulting in
greater severity, extent, and progression of periodontal
diseases.

The role of the polymorphonuclear neutrophil in the

fact, the neutrophil has been described as the first-line
of defence against periodontal pathogens (49). Defects
in neutrophil function and recruitment in diabetics have

been observed (5052). Bissada et al. showed that
peripheral blood neutrophils have reduced chemotactic
activity in type 1 diabetics with severe periodontitis
when compared with diabetics with moderate period-
ontitis and non-diabetics with severe periodontitis (50).
They also showed that
the phagocytic activity of
peripheral blood neutrophils of type 1 diabetics with
localised periodontitis was lower than non-diabetics with
localised periodontitis.

Monocytes/macrophages are also altered in diabetics,
potentially exacerbating the progression and severity of
periodontal disease. Diabetics may possess a hyper-
responsive monocyte/macrophage phenotype in which
there is increased synthesis and secretion of proinflam-
matory mediators such as TNF-a, IL-1b, and PGE2.
Salvi et al. demonstrated this by culturing peripheral
blood monocytes from type 1 diabetics and healthy
controls with varying degrees of periodontitis and
examining the production of TNF-a in response to
LPS (53). They demonstrated that monocytes from
diabetics have between 24 and 32 times more TNF-a
production (depending on the concentration of LPS)
than non-diabetic controls,
irrespective of periodontal
status. The same research group also showed signifi-
cantly higher levels of IL-1b and PGE2 from cultured
monocytes and in the GCF of type 1 diabetics compared
with non-diabetics who were matched for periodontal
disease severity (54). This exaggerated inflammatory
response would be likely to stimulate increased secretion
of matrix metalloproteinases, with subsequent increased
degradation of the extracellular matrix of the period-
ontal tissues,
leading to increased loss of attachment
(55), although a recent study failed to show this
experimentally (56).

Altered tissue homeostasis, wound healing, and host
inflammatory response are likely to be the result of
accumulation of AGEs within the gingival/periodontal
tissues. The interaction of AGEs with the receptor for
AGE (RAGE) may, in part, add further explanation (57).
RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily
of cell surface molecules. Under normal healthy condi-
tions, RAGE is present in endothelial cells, smooth
muscle cells, neurons, and monocytes. However,
in
diabetes, expression of RAGE is markedly increased
(57). AGEs can then bind to RAGE, leading to further
complications such as the development of vascular
lesions, increased vascular permeability, increased expres-
sion of adhesion molecules, and increased migration and
activation of monocytes (57).

Periodontitis and diabetic control
As outlined above there is clear evidence that diabetics
have increased prevalence and severity of periodontitis

and that
individuals with periodontitis have an in-
creased prevalence of diabetes. Indeed, unstable period-
ontitis may have the potential
to worsen glycaemic
control
in diabetics. Taylor et al. showed that in the
Pima Indian population of Arizona individuals with
severe periodontitis had up to 13 times greater risk of
worsening glycaemic control after 2 years, depending on
age (58).

Interventional studies, in which glycaemic control was
assessed in participants with pre-existing periodontitis
and diabetes before and after a course of periodontal
therapy, provide insight into this relationship. Rando-
mised controlled trials have demonstrated significant
improvements to glycaemic control in type 1 (59) and
type 2 diabetics (60, 61) following non-surgical period-
ontal therapy. Several other studies, however, failed to
support
including randomised controlled trials
investigating type 1 diabetics (62, 63) and type 2 diabetics
(64).

It has been suggested that antibiotics, when used as
part of periodontal
therapy in diabetics, may have
additional benefits in terms of periodontal and glycae-
mic control outcomes. Grossi et al. found that only non-
surgical periodontal
therapy with the addition of
systemic doxycycline (100 mg for 2 weeks) had a
significant effect on glycaemic control, while non-
surgical periodontal therapy without systemic antibiotics
did not (65). However, this finding is questioned in a
study by Rodrigues et al., which found that patients who
received non-surgical periodontal
therapy alone had
significantly reduced HBA1c after 3 months, while
patients who received non-surgical periodontal therapy
with the addition of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid did not
(61).

The significant heterogeneity of the above-mentioned
studies in terms of design and findings means there is
difficulty in drawing clear conclusions. Janket et al.
conducted a meta-analysis of interventional studies that
evaluated the effect of periodontal treatment on glycae-
mic control. They included 10 studies involving type 1
and type 2 diabetics and found that the reductions in
HbA1c were small (B1%) and not statistically significant.
In type 2 diabetics there was a decrease in HbA1c of 0.4%
following non-surgical periodontal therapy alone and a
decrease of 0.7% with the addition of antimicrobials (66).
More recently, two further meta-analyses were conducted
(67, 68). The analysis by Teeuw et al. (68) included five
studies with a total of 371 type 2 diabetic patients and
Simpson et al. (67) included 244 participants, predomi-
nantly type 2 diabetics, from three studies. Both meta-
analyses showed a statistically significant improvement of
0.4% in HbA1c level. Simpson et al. (67) found no added
benefit from the use of adjunctive antibiotics in lowering

HbA1c or improving clinical parameters. Put in context,
every percentage point reduction in HbA1c correlates
with a 35% reduction in microvascular complications
(69). Therefore, it appears likely that periodontal therapy
has a clinically measurable benefit to the long-term
glycaemic control of diabetics.

influencing glycaemic control
in diabetics is feasible.
Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a,
which are all
important mediators of periodontal
inflammation, also play a role in glucose and lipid
metabolism. Plasma concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-a
may be increased in obese individuals and in type 2
diabetics. Notably, IL-6 and TNF-a act as adipokines
that serve to promote catabolism and weight loss and
are also involved in insulin resistance. It has been
proposed that the inflamed periodontium may act as
an endocrine-like source of
inflammatory mediators
such as TNF-a, IL-1, and IL-6, which can subsequently
increase insulin resistance (70).

stantial surface area of
Using a measure of periodontal inflamed surface area
(PISA), Nesse et al. showed a dose-response relationship
between PISA and HbA1c levels, suggesting a link (71).
Numerous studies have demonstrated that individuals
with chronic periodontitis have an elevated state of
systemic inflammation. C-reactive protein (CRP), which
is a widely used marker of systemic inflammation, has
been shown to be elevated in patients with chronic
periodontitis even when controlling for confounding
factors (7275). Similarly, other inflammatory mediators
including TNF-a and IL-6 have also been shown to be
elevated in the blood of
individuals with chronic
periodontitis (7678).

Transient bacteraemias occur in all individuals and it
is suspected that
individuals with periodontitis may
experience a higher frequency of bacteraemia due to
the large surface area of ulcerated pocket epithelium
that is in constant contact with the plaque biofilm (79).
Bacteraemias occur both in patients with gingivitis and
periodontitis following routine oral hygiene procedures
such as flossing and may even occur subsequent to
mastication (80, 81). A link between bacteraemia of
periodontal origin and systemic complications such as
atherosclerosis and adverse pregnancy outcomes has
been postulated for over 20 years (82, 83). While the
systemic inflammation hypothesis may apply to these
complications, other mechanisms such as direct infec-
tion (84) and molecular mimicry (85) have been
postulated. There is now robust evidence supporting
molecular mimicry as a biological mechanism linking
chronic periodontitis to accelerated development of

atherosclerotic plaques (86, 87). The possibility of a
direct effect of bacteraemia and diabetic control has not
been explored.

Conclusion
While the epidemiological association between period-
ontitis and diabetes is becoming relatively clear, the
biological mechanisms of the association are yet to be
fully elucidated. As a clearer understanding of
the
influence of periodontal inflammation on the composi-
tion of the subgingival biofilm emerges, the link between
periodontitis and diabetes will also become better under-
stood. It is recognised that as progression of periodontal
disease occurs,
there is a simultaneous increase in
numbers of anaerobic species in subgingival plaque, as
well as an increase in inflammation, both local and
systemic. Whether it is because of the effect of diabetes on
subgingival plaque or the effect on the host response that
results in greater disease progression remains uncertain.
Indeed, both mechanisms are probably involved. Like-
wise, the mechanism behind the effect of periodontitis on
diabetic control is equally unclear. The importance of
systemic inflammation exacerbated by periodontal
in-
flammation is compelling. The role of bacteria in these
processes has not been fully explored and remains the
subject of future research.
