Background: Dental caries has been strongly associated with mutans streptococci, particularly Streptococcus
mutans and S. sobrinus. Many studies have linked these organisms to the carious process and counts of
mutans streptococci have been used to monitor caries risk. The high levels of caries generally found in Iceland
have enabled several studies to be performed on the variation within strains of S. mutans.
Methods: This paper reports some studies showing phenotypic differences between strains of S. mutans that
were related to whether the strain was isolated from an individual with active caries or from a caries-free
subject.
Results: Strains from individuals with active caries generally adhered better to apatite, were more vigorous in
decalcifying apatite and had bacteriocin-like activity that was likely to help the strain compete successfully
with other strains, for example in the dental plaque biofilm.
Conclusions: Phenotypic differences exist between strains of S. mutans depending on the caries activity of the
individual from whom the strain was isolated.

S treptococcus mutans has been recognised for many

years as the predominant microorganism in the
aetiology of dental caries. It is the key cariogenic
organism according to the ‘specific plaque hypothesis’ (1)
and a considerable amount of research has been carried
out on the role of this organism in causing caries and in
predicting a higher caries risk (2, 3). Counts of mutans
streptococci
samples, usually salivary
samples, have been extensively used to predict and
monitor caries risk (46) Furthermore S. mutans has
been shown to be transmitted from mother to child,
leading to the potential early onset of caries (7, 8); to
colonise the mouths of children during ‘windows of
infectivity’ that also open up the possibility of caries
(9). Early colonisation of
the mouth with mutans
streptococci results in more caries later in life (3) and
high counts of mutans streptococci in samples of dental
plaque or saliva have been shown to predict a higher
incidence of caries (4, 5). The considerable amount of
clinical data linking mutans streptococci to dental caries
is further backed up by a vast amount of laboratory and
animal studies, not least the production of a vaccine (10)
that has been shown to protect against caries induced in

experimental animals, including monkeys, by S. mutans
and a highly cariogenic diet.

Dental caries has been a major problem in Iceland for
several decades. The prevalence of caries was higher than
in other Nordic countries (11) and the decline in caries
recorded in N. America, Europe and elsewhere in the
latter part of the 20th century did not occur in Iceland
until later and, according to the latest surveys, caries
prevalence seems to have risen again (12). A number of
studies of mutans streptococci have been carried out in
Iceland that have served to confirm a number of
conclusions that fit with the specific plaque hypothesis
(1316). Interestingly, one longitudinal study of
the
development of approximal caries on originally healthy
approximal tooth surfaces showed that S. mutans some-
times only appeared on the particular approximal tooth
surface after the development of caries as detected
radiographically. In all cases the count of S. mutans
increased following the onset of caries (16).

Streptococcus sobrinus belongs to the group termed
mutans
streptococci and was originally a serotype
(d, g, h) of S. mutans, later being reclassified as a species
and one that is known to be particularly cariogenic due to

its enhanced production of acid and tolerance of low pH.
S. sobrinus is, consequently, often associated with parti-
cularly severe caries both in studies of communities (17)
and individuals (18, 19) and its frequency in the oral flora
was found to be high in Iceland and associated with more
observed caries (1820).

Streptococcus mutans has been isolated from indivi-
duals in Iceland over at least three decades and a number
of microbiological factors have been investigated. It has
been of particular interest that S. mutans strains were
sometimes isolated from individuals that had no caries
although high counts of mutans streptococci in saliva
samples were usually isolated from individuals with much
caries. The salivary count of S. mutans was a significant
component in a caries activity test developed from the
analysis of salivary, microbiological and dietary data
collected in a longitudinal study of Icelandic children
aged 46 years (5, 15) However, the mutans count alone
was not sufficient to give a reliable indication of caries
risk for any particular individual. Ko¨ hler and Krasse (21)
demonstrated in a hamster model, greatly increased
carious destruction of
teeth when the experimental
animal was fed a cariogenic diet including a strain of S.
mutans from an Icelandic patient compared with an
experimental animal receiving the same diet but including
the S. mutans strain Ingbritt, that has been widely used in
microbiological
finding (21)
prompted further studies of the role of mutans strepto-
cocci in caries that have subsequently been carried out in
the research laboratory of the Faculty of Odontology,
University of Iceland. In particular one aim was to
determine if any differences were present between those
strains of S. mutans that were isolated from individuals
with no caries compared with those strains isolated from
individuals with much caries. These investigations were
used to determine phenotypic differences between strains
in these two categories. Studies on this collection of
strains over a number of years have included investigation
of adherence of
the strains to hydroxyapatite and
decalcification of hydroxyapatite. Both these properties
can be envisaged to play a role in the caries process and
represent areas where strain differences may be signifi-
cant with respect to pathogenicity. Later, bacteriocin-like
activity was investigated as such bacterial
interaction
might play a role in determining which bacteria can
become established in the dental plaque biofilm (22, 23).

studies of caries. This

Materials and methods
Strains of S. mutans were collected regularly from
subjects of different ages from 4 years up to adulthood
as part of one of a number of research projects aimed at
assessing caries risk (15, 16, 18, 20). Ethical permission
for each study was obtained from the relevant authority
in Iceland as appropriate. Following the completion of
these individual studies a collection of 38 strains of S.

mutans was established (24 from subjects with active
caries and 14 from individuals that were caries-free
according to the examination criteria used in each
particular study). All strains were stored frozen at 
808C in a preservative medium (Nunc cryotubes, Fisher
Scientific Loughborough, UK) All personal identifiers
were removed and the strain collection was merely
grouped into the identification of the species as S. mutans
or S. sobrinus and the disease category as either caries-
free or considerable active caries above average for the
age group.

Adherence to hydroxyapatite
Test strains were removed from the freezer, cultured for
48 h in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco) and subsequently
incubated overnight in Todd-Hewitt broth containing
tritiated thymidine and hydroxyapatite powder (Sigma-
Aldrich) (24). The cultures were shaken gently on a Gyro
rocker (Stuart Scientific, Keison International Ltd, UK).
Following this treatment, the cultures were centrifuged
and washed to remove non-adherent bacteria. The apatite
powder was dissolved in 1N HCl and 0.25 mL aliquots
transferred to a scintillation tube to which were added 1
mL Hionic fluor scintillation fluid and the radioactive

instruments, Rockville, Md, USA).

individuals
(14 strains) aged 720 years were obtained from the
strain collection and cultured for 24 h in Todd-Hewitt
broth (Difco). Cultures were centrifuged and 40 mg of
bacterial deposit was resuspended in 400 mL glucose to
which 40 mg hydroxyapatite slurry (Sigma) was added.
This culture was incubated for 5 h at 378C on a Gyro
rocker (Stuart Scientific, Keison International Ltd, UK).
Cultures were then centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 rpm
(Microspin 12S, Sorvall Instruments, UK). Then the pH
of the supernatant fluid was determined and the calcium
concentration of the supernatant was determined using
10 mL aliquots tested in a clinical chemistry autoanalyser
(Kodak, Rochester, USA) at 680 nm.

Bacteriocin-like activity
The bacteriocin-like inhibitory effect was tested, using the
methods of Rogers (22) and Parrot et al. (23). All eight
test strains of S. mutans from caries-active individuals
with open caries and the eight test strains from caries-free
individuals were investigated against each other. Thus
each strain was tested for bacteriocin-like activity against
15 strains of S. mutans. In addition, 14 S. mutans strains
(seven from caries active and seven from caries-free

individuals) were tested using the same methodology
against a laboratory collection of 25 oral microorganisms
as listed in Table 3. All test strains were grown overnight
in Todd-Hewitt broth, yielding approximately 105/cfu/
mL, and 1 mL of each culture was used to inoculate
pour-plates of semi-solid tryptic-soy-yeast-extract agar.

bacteriocin-like production. After the pour plates had
set all of the test strains were stab-inoculated into the
agar surface of each pour plate. These pour plates were
then incubated at 378C in a candle jar for 48 h and zones
of inhibition of the indicator strain around the stab
inoculations were viewed in a bifocal microscope and the
diameter of the zone of inhibition measured. Zones of
inhibition of
the indicator strains around the stab
inoculated test strain ranged from 7 to 12 mm and all
zones of diameter 7 mm or greater were recorded as
positive for bacteriocin activity.

Results

Adherence of S. mutans strains to hydroxyapatite
Strains of S. mutans isolated from caries-active indivi-
duals were found to adhere significantly better to apatite
than did those strains isolated from caries-free subjects
(Student?s t-test; pB0.05), see Table 1.

Decalcification of hydroxyapatite by strains of S.
mutans
Strains of S. mutans from individuals with active caries
were found to release significantly more calcium from
hydroxyapatite than strains isolated from caries-free
individuals (Student?s t-test; pB0.02), see Table 2.

The pH of the individual cultures was measured at the
end of the incubation period. Considerable strain varia-
tion in the final pH was observed with pH values from
caries-active individuals ranging from 4.1 to 4.9 (mean
4.4; SD 0.23) and from caries-free individuals 4.25.1
(mean 4.6; SD 0.19) but the difference in final pH
between strains was significantly lower in the cultures
containing
individuals
(Student?s t-test; pB0.01).

from subjects that were caries free (average 1.0 strains;
pB0.01(chi2); see Fig. 1). Furthermore 7/8 strains from
caries active individuals inhibited ]2 other strains of
S. mutans whereas only 1/8 strains from a caries-free
individual inhibited ]2 other strains of S. mutans.

When bacteriocin-like inhibition of 25 oral commensal
organisms by S. mutans producer strains was tested
(seven strains from caries active individuals and seven
strains from caries-free individuals) the strains of S.
mutans from caries-free individuals were found to be
significantly more inhibitory to other oral commensals
than the strains from caries active individuals (pB0.001;
see Table 3).

Thus the seven S. mutans strains from caries-free
individuals inhibited other oral commensals in a total
of 88/126 tests whereas the seven S. mutans strains
inhibited from caries-active individuals inhibited oral
commensals in only 58/126 tests (t-test; pB0.05)

this organism and indeed it was hoped to add to our
knowledge of the pathogenic capacity of this bacterium in
the light of the high levels of caries that were being
investigated. The findings of Ko¨ hler and Krasse (21) that
an Icelandic strain of S. mutans was particularly cario-
genic in an animal model reinforced this line of thought.
Laboratory studies then demonstrated that Icelandic
strains of S. mutans from subjects with active caries
indeed adhered significantly better to hydroxyapatite and
decalcified hydroxyapatite significantly more than strains
isolated from subjects that were caries free. Furthermore
the prevalence of S. sobrinus had been found in several
studies (1820) to be relatively high in the Icelandic
population,
the teeth of
Icelanders were in a rather more cariogenic environment
than was found in many other studies being carried out at
this time.

reinforcing the view that

With the development of the ecological plaque hypoth-
esis (27, 28) the emphasis on the differing cariogenic
potentials of strains of mutans streptococci began to
wane. Studies of bacteriocin-like activity among the
Icelandic test strains suggested indeed that the strains
of S. mutans from caries active subjects were more
aggressive at inhibiting other strains of S. mutans than
those strains isolated from caries-free individuals. Thus S.
mutans from caries-active individuals may dominate the
less cariogenic strains of the same species and succeed
in finding space to adhere and multiply within the
cariogenic dental plaque biofilm. In caries-free indivi-
duals, however, the apparently less cariogenic strains of S.
mutans appear to compete more successfully against
other oral commensals than do the more cariogenic
strains of S. mutans. These less cariogenic strains then
occupy the niche for S. mutans-like organism within the
dental plaque biofilm and thus help maintain its low
cariogenicity. Several studies of bacteriocin-like proper-

ties have suggested a significant role for this activity in
the ecology of dental plaque (7, 2931). It is quite
possible that
the differing degrees of cariogenicity
seen in S. mutans strains from caries-active and caries-
free subjects could be a reflection of the oral/ dental
environment from which the organisms were originally
isolated rather than a genetically determined pathogenic
potential. Thus S. mutans bacteria in a dental biofilm
that has ready access to sucrose could have several
metabolic pathways working that contribute to the
cariogenicity of the organism whereas S. mutans strains
from a biofilm that
for
example, may have to compete with other organisms to
retain a place in the biofilm but this possibly results in
less expression of the cariogenic potential of the S.
mutans strain.

is less exposed to sucrose,

In developing this hypothesis further the authors
were fortunate in being asked to submit strains of S.
mutans from this collection to an international study of
possible genetic differences between strains isolated from
caries-active and caries-free individuals. This investiga-
tion was carried out by recently by Do et al. (32)
and showed no genetic differences between strains and
thus reinforces somewhat the ecological plaque hypoth-
esis and the idea that the increased cariogenic properties
found in strains of S. mutans from caries-active subjects
are manifestations of phenotypic characteristics related
to the environment from which the strains were sampled.
It may also serve to illustrate the considerable poten-
tial for adaptability of strains of S. mutans in the oral
cavity.

Conflict of interest and funding
There is no conflict of interest in the present study for
either of the authors.
