Background: Tobacco and alcohol are risk factors associated with cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract, but
increasingly the role of infection and chronic inflammation is recognized as being significant in cancer
development. Bacteria, particularly Helicobacter pylori, and viruses such as members of the human papilloma
virus family and hepatitis B and C are strongly implicated as etiological factors in certain cancers. There is less
evidence for an association between fungi and cancer, although it has been recognized for many years that
white patches on the oral mucosa, which are infected with Candida, have a greater likelihood of undergoing
malignant transformation than those that are not infected.
Objective: This article reviews the association between the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma in
potentially malignant oral lesions with chronic candidal infection and describes mechanisms that may be
involved in Candida-associated malignant transformation.

Keywords: Candida albicans; oral cancer; acetaldehyde; proinﬂammatory cytokines; inﬂammation and cancer

Infection is an important cause of cancer, causing

approximately one in five malignancies worldwide
(1, 2). The three main examples are infection with
the bacterium Helicobacter pylori leading to an elevated
risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric
lymphoma,
infection with particular types of human
papilloma virus (HPV) leading to cervical cancer, tonsillar
carcinoma and some cases of oral squamous cell carci-
noma (OSCC) and chronic hepatitis B and C infections
leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (14). The herpes-
virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), is implicated in a range of
malignancies including Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma and another
member of the herpesvirus family, human herpesvirus 8, is
a causal factor in Kaposi sarcoma (2, 3). Chronic infection
with Opisthorchis viverrine, the Thai liver fluke and other
liver flukes are associated with cholangiocarcinoma and
there is evidence suggesting an association between
schistosomiasis and bladder cancer (2).

There is less evidence of an etiological association
between fungal infection and cancer, although for many

years Candida spp. have been implicated in various
epithelial cancers. Candidal infection does not appear
to be a risk factor for dysplastic cervical
lesions or
cervical carcinoma (5) and most interest in Candida and
carcinogenesis is related to oral and esophageal carci-
noma. There have been a number of reports of oral or
esophageal carcinoma developing in immunocompro-
mised patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
and often with autoimmune
polyendocrinopathy-
candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (69). But what evi-
dence links candidal infection with OSCC in patients
with a functional immune system? The aim of this paper
is to review the association between the development of
OSCC in potentially malignant oral lesions with chronic
candidal infection and to describe mechanisms that may
be involved.

Several Candida spp. are common commensal fungi
that frequently can be found colonizing the oral mucosa.
From cross-sectional studies, asymptomatic carriage rates
in healthy individuals range from 3 to 70% but the true
prevalence is probably much higher (10). Most oral

Candida are ‘opportunistic pathogens’ where, depending
on the local oral microenvironment or whether host
defense mechanisms are compromised, they can trans-
form from a harmless commensal to an organism causing
oral mucosal infection leading to a range of conditions.
Epidemiological studies have shown that when host
defenses are compromised most candidal infections arise
from an endogenous commensal strain rather than an
exogenous strain (11, 12). This paper will concentrate on
chronic candidal infection, specifically chronic hyperplas-
tic candidiasis (CHC), sometimes also known as ‘candi-
dal leukoplakia.’

Association of Candida spp. with leukoplakia
and chronic hyperplastic candidiasis
Cernea et al. (13) and Jepsen and Winther (14) were the
first to recognize Candida infection in oral leukoplakias
and introduced the term ‘candidal leukoplakia.’ Since
most definitions of leukoplakia refer to it being idio-
pathic (15), the preferred clinical term for an adherent
white patch shown to be infected with Candida is CHC
rather than ‘candidal leukoplakia.’ The CHC is a form of
oral candidiasis that typically presents as an adherent
chronic white patch on the commissures of the oral
mucosa, although other sites of the oral mucosa may also
be affected. It is characterized by hyphal invasion of the
epithelial surface, which usually becomes parakerati-
nized; the hyphae rarely extend beyond the parakeratin
layer. Candida albicans is the most common Candida
species present in candidal
leukoplakia/CHC (14, 16)
although other species such as Candida dubliniensis,
Candida tropicalis, Candida pintolopesii, Candida glab-
rata, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been identified in
these lesions (17, 18).

CHC has a propensity to undergo malignant transfor-
mation. Cawson (19) found that 6 out of 10 tissue
biopsies
initially diagnosed as CHC progressed to
OSCC while Eyre and Nally (20) reported that 2 of 3
CHC cases underwent malignant
transformation. In
contrast, some CHC lesions resolve when treated with
antifungals (21). Lamey et al. (22) reported a case of
candidal
leukoplakia with epithelial dysplasia that re-
solved within 11 days of systemic treatment with a
triazole antifungal.

It has been shown that leukoplakia with candidal
infection has a higher rate of malignant transformation
than uninfected leukoplakia, with estimates that 15%
of non-dysplastic CHC will progress
to dysplastic
lesions with 10% of these developing OSCC (23, 24).
McCullough et al. (25) postulated that the progression of
CHC to dysplasia is advanced by C. albicans. Signifi-
cantly more lesions infected with Candida showed pro-
gressively more severe dysplasia in subsequent biopsies
than occurred in subsequent biopsies from patients
without candidal infection in the initial specimen (26).

It has also been observed that the level of oral carriage of
C. albicans is higher in patients presenting with leuko-
plakia or OSCC than in patients without oral pathology
(25). Furthermore, C. albicans was detected in the biofilm
removed from the surface of 8/21 untreated OSCC lesions
but not from contiguous normal control sites (27).

It remains uncertain as to whether C. albicans is
actually responsible for the malignant transformation in
potentially malignant lesions. The presence of C. albicans
does not necessarily prove a causal relationship and it has
been argued that the presence of Candida in a white lesion
is incidental and it has merely colonized a pre-existing
lesion, due to favorable environmental conditions (14).
Alternatively C. albicans may have a direct or indirect
role in oral carcinogenesis and some C. albicans biotypes
may contribute more to carcinogenesis than others.
Arguments for and against these possibilities will be
discussed below.

Attributes of C.albicans that may influence oral
cancer development

Colonization of the epithelium
The ability of C. albicans to colonize, penetrate, and
damage host tissues depends on an imbalance between
C. albicans virulence factors and host defenses, often
due to specific defects in the immune system (28, 29). C.
albicans virulence factors and adherence to mucosal or
artificial surfaces in the mouth have been extensively
reviewed (30, 31). Two different mechanisms by which
C. albicans can invade keratinocytes have been proposed
(32). One mechanism involves the secretion of degrada-
tive enzymes by the fungus, particularly secreted aspar-
tic proteases that can digest epithelial cell surface
components and, thereby, allow the physical movement
of hyphae into, or between, host cells. The second
proposed mechanism is the induction of epithelial cell
endocytosis (33). C. albicans stimulates keratinocytes to
produce pseudopod-like structures that surround the
fungus and draw it into the cell in a process involving
the E-cadherin pathway (33). Recently,
it has been
shown that adhesion,
invasion, and damage by C.
albicans depends not only on fungal morphology and
activity, but also on the keratinocyte type and stage of
differentiation,
indicating that epithelial cells differ in
their susceptibility to the fungus (34). Another factor
that contributes to the adhesion of C. albicans to
mucosal surfaces is a fibrillar surface component of
the yeast cell wall, a strain-specific mannoprotein layer
(3537). Several cell surface proteins have been identi-
fied as adhesins recognizing host molecules and postu-
lated to mediate the formation of C. albicans biofilms in
vitro (31, 38, 39).

Ability to produce carcinogens and initiate
carcinogenesis
induce OSCC by directly producing
Candida might
carcinogenic compounds,
for example, nitrosamines
(40). Such a carcinogen will bind with DNA to form
adducts with bases, phosphate residues, and/or hydrogen
bonding sites that could cause miscoding or irregularities
with DNA replication (41). Point mutations thus induced
may activate specific oncogenes and initiate the develop-
ment of oral cancer. Krogh et al. (42) showed that some
Candida spp. isolated from leukoplakia lesions were able
to produce the potent carcinogen N-nitrosobenzylmethy-
lamine (NBMA). The ability to catalyze the formation of
NBMA was strain-dependent and these particular strains
were relatively rare in the oral cavity (18). Strains with the
highest potential to produce NBMA were isolated from
advanced, potentially malignant, oral mucosal
lesions
rather than early lesions or normal oral mucosa (42). It
was suggested that the tubular hyphal structure of C.
albicans might be important as this structure allows
ingress of precursors from saliva and a release of the
nitrosamine product to keratinocytes, potentially initiat-
ing OSCC (42). However,
in a mouse model of oral
carcinogenesis Dwivedi et al. (43) found that infection
with C. albicans alone was not capable of inducing
dysplasia or OSCC.

Ability to promote carcinogenesis in initiated
epithelium
C. albicans has been shown to act as a promoter of oral
carcinogenesis in rat and mouse OSCC models where
carcinogenesis had been initiated by repeated adminis-
tration of 4 nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) (43, 44). As
well as histological evidence of dysplasia in the mice
exposed to both 4NQO and C. albicans, there was
increased Ki-67 and p16 expression in comparison with
mice treated with 4NQO alone or C. albicans alone
suggesting that Candida creates an environment condu-
cive to cell proliferation that may lead to clonal expan-
sion of genetically altered cells (43).

Ability to metabolize procarcinogens
Alcohol consumption is known to be an important risk
factor for the development of OSCC. In vitro studies with
human tissue culture cells and animal studies have shown
that alcohol itself is not a carcinogen (45). Rather, it is the
products of alcohol metabolism that are active factors in
carcinogenesis. Metabolism of ethanol results in the
generation of toxic compounds such as acetaldehyde,
hydroxyethyl
radicals, ethoxy radicals, and hydroxy
radicals (46, 47). Acetaldehyde is highly toxic, mutagenic,
and carcinogenic and this effect has been shown in many
cell culture studies, as well as in animal models (4749).
An increased prevalence of oral cancer is seen in certain
populations with a genetic predisposition to accumulate

A review of oral squamous cell carcinoma and candidal infection

acetaldehyde in oral tissues following ingestion of alco-
hol. The enzymes involved in acetaldehyde metabolism
are aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and alcohol dehy-
drogenase (ADH). In the mouth the conversion of
alcohol
to acetaldehyde can be catalyzed by ADH
enzymes from the epithelium and also from oral micro-
organisms. Clinical studies have shown that oral fungi
and bacteria may be a major source of acetaldehyde in
the oral cavity (40, 5053). Furthermore,
in vitro, C.
albicans cultures accumulated higher concentrations of
acetaldehyde compared to other Candida species (54).

Acetaldehyde in the oral cavity can also come from
tobacco smoking. Tobacco use, like alcohol consump-
tion, has a definite epidemiological association with the
development of OSCC, suggesting an etiological role.
Tobacco smoke contains toxic aldehydes, and the com-
bined use of tobacco and alcohol has a synergistic effect
on the risk of developing oral cancer (55). Homann et al.
(50) showed that tobacco smokers exposed to ethanol
had a high concentration of salivary acetaldehyde. Our
recent investigations (Bakri et al., unpublished observa-
tions) have revealed that Adh1p is the major C. albicans
ADH isoenzyme catalyzing ethanol utilization and,
therefore, acetaldehyde production, and that there is a
constitutive expression of C. albicans ADH1 mRNA in
CHC biopsy samples. Taken together these data suggest
that acetaldehyde may play an important role in the
development of oral cancer. Studies assessing the effect of
using the amino acid cysteine to interfere with acetalde-
hyde-related cancer progression have been initiated (56,
57). Cysteine binds acetaldehyde to form a stable
compound thus eliminating its carcinogenic effect (56).

Ability to modify the microenvironment and induce
chronic inflammation
The association between cancer and chronic inflamma-
tion has been debated for many years, but recently the
role of epithelialconnective tissue interactions and the
activity of chronic inflammatory cells and mediators in
the tumor microenvironment has been gaining attention
(5860). Tumor growth and invasion involves multiple
interactions between tumor cells and stromal cells.
Among the many different stromal events that may
contribute to carcinogenesis is the induction of specific
proteolytic enzymes, able to degrade components of the
basement membrane and/or fibrous stroma (59, 61, 62).
C. albicans has been shown to secrete specific proteinases,
capable of degrading basement membrane and extracel-
lular matrix (63, 64). Degradation of laminin-332, a
laminin present in the basement membrane associated
with oral epithelium, by C. albicans has been described
(65). C. albicans has also been demonstrated to degrade
E-cadherin, a transmembrane glycoprotein important in
adhesion of adjacent keratinocytes (66). These findings
have implications not only on the potential for tissue

invasion by the organism, but on the potential to enhance
the invasion of genetically altered epithelial cells, first by
reducing keratinocyte cohesion and then by assisting
their passage through the basement membrane.

Mucosal bacterial infection will induce chronic inflam-
mation in the adjacent connective tissue leading to
upregulation of cytokines and growth factors, which in
turn may influence carcinogenesis (67, 68). This process
has been well described in gastric carcinogenesis where H.
pylori infection leads to chronic inflammation and over-
expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-2 is an
enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostanoids
(prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclins) and is
strongly expressed in esophageal, gastric, and colon
cancer and precancerous lesions (69). Long-term use of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (e.g. celecoxib
that block COX-2 production) substantially reduces the
risk of these cancers (70, 71). Altered COX-2 expression,
which correlated with an altered expression of cytoplas-
mic HuR protein (a protein that regulates the stability of
COX-2 mRNA) has been shown in OSCC (72). C.
albicans has been found to induce IL-8 secretion of
endothelial cells by stimulating the cells to produce TNF-
a (73). Wenghoefer et al. (74) did not detect increased
expression of COX-2 or the proinflammatory cytokines
IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, or TNF-a in biopsy specimens
of leukoplakia and concluded that chronic inflammation
was not involved in the pathogenesis of leukoplakia. The
samples they used were homogeneous leukoplakia. Non-
homogeneous leukoplakias, with a known higher risk of
malignant transformation (75), were excluded and so this
conclusion is not necessarily applicable to nonhomoge-
neous lesions infected with Candida or CHC.

The transcription factor NF-kB, a key coordinator of
innate immunity and inflammation, is also an important
tumor promoter (76, 77). It responds to signals from the
toll-like receptor (TLR)-My88 signaling pathway, which
is activated after tissue damage and microbial infection
and can also be turned on as a result of genetic
alterations in tumor cells (76). NF-kB activates genes
encoding inflammatory cytokines and enzymes such as
COX-2. Members of the TLR family have been shown to
be important in the recognition of C. albicans and
consequent induction of cytokines (78). Hence, candidal
infection may activate particular TLRs that can commu-
nicate with the tumor promoter NF-kB. NF-kB is
frequently involved in carcinogenesis where cancer-re-
lated inflammation is a feature (76). The link between C.
albicans, TLR and NF-kB, and the production of
cytokines and enzymes in the prostaglandin synthesis
pathway, such as COX-2, is another potential mechanism
whereby C. albicans might influence the development of
oral cancer. This influence is likely to be exerted in the
early stages of cancer development, but cancer-related
inflammation is also involved in the metastasis of

malignant cells (76). C. albicans enhanced the develop-
ment of hepatic melanoma metastases in a mouse model
via the elaboration of prometastatic cytokines IL-18 and
TNF-a within the blood as well as in the tumor
microenvironment (79).

Conclusion
Although Candida spp., particularly C. albicans, has been
implicated in oral and esophageal cancer development,
the pathogenic mechanisms and its carcinogenic capabil-
ity is not clearly understood. C. albicans is a normal
commensal within the oral cavity and simply the presence
of the fungal species itself does not relate to the etiology
of cancers. Apart from the ability to produce carcinogens
such as nitrosamine, which has been known for some
time, recently other mechanisms by which Candida spp.
may promote the development of cancer have been
explored. The metabolism of ethanol to the carcinogenic
acetaldehyde and the induction of proinflammatory
cytokines may be important etiological factors in oral
cancer development. Perhaps these new findings will
generate interest in the potential association between
Candida and oral cancer and spur controlled prospective
clinical studies in this field. In the meantime the advice
given by Sitheeque and Samaranayake (80), who advo-
cated that recalcitrant CHC lesions that do not resolve
after antifungal therapy should be monitored closely and
who said strong consideration should be given to their
removal either by conventional surgery or laser surgery,
remains sound.
