Abstract
Evidence is mounting to suggest that the transfer of carbon through roots of plants to the soil plays a
primary role in regulating ecosystem responses to climate change and its mitigation. Future research is
needed to improve understanding of the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon, its consequences for
ecosystem carbon cycling, and the potential to exploit plant root traits and soil microbial processes that
favor soil carbon sequestration.

Introduction
Human activities are rapidly changing the world’s ecosys-
tems, with overall dire consequences for the Earth. The
most obvious human impact is through the worldwide
conversion of land for food production, but terrestrial
ecosystems are also affected by climate change, invasion
of alien species into new territories, and increasing rates
of nitrogen deposition. This has led to a groundswell of
research aimed at improving understanding of the impact
of global changes on biodiversity and how ecosystems
function, and also on management strategies to mitigate
them.

Despite this topic receiving considerable attention, it is
only recently that scientists have become aware that
understanding the consequences of global change for
ecosystem functioning requires consideration of linkages
between plant and belowground microbial communities
[1]. This is because the impact of human-induced global
changes on the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems is
often indirect: they operate via changes aboveground that
cascade belowground to the hugely complex soil bio-
logical community, which drives biogeochemical pro-
cesses and feedbacks to the Earth’s climate system. Here I
highlight some recent developments in this area that
illustrate how a combined aboveground–belowground
approach can improve understanding of the conse-
quences of global change for the Earth. In particular,
recent studies have advanced our understanding of the

role that plant–microbial–soil interactions, and specifi-
cally root carbon transfer to soil, play in governing the
impact of climate change on ecosystem carbon cycling
and climate mitigation.

Plant–soil feedbacks and climate change
The soil is the third largest global store of carbon and,
together with plants, contains around 2.7 times more
carbon than the atmosphere. As a result, there is much
concern that climate change will enhance the decomposi-
tion of this carbon, potentially shifting soils from being
carbon sinks to sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide and
thereby accelerating climate change—the so-called carbon
cycle feedback. Conversely, there is much current debate
about the potential to increase the capacity of soils to
sequester carbon from the atmosphere and hence mitigate
climate change. Recent studies reveal that both of these
processes, namely the loss and gain of carbon in soil, are
strongly regulated by plant–microbial–soil interactions.

Climate change can affect soil carbon through a variety of
routes, both directly and indirectly (Figure 1) [2]. With
regard to direct effects, recent studies show that even subtle
warming (by approximately 1°C) can directly stimulate
microbial activity causing an increase in ecosystem
respiration rates in subarctic peatland [3]. Likewise, it
was recently shown that permafrost thaw over decades in
an Alaskan tundra landscape has caused significant losses
of soil carbon, despite increased plant growth and

Figure 1. Direct and indirect effects of climate change on soil microbial communities and feedback to the Earth’s carbon dioxide
production

Direct effects include the influence on soil microbes and greenhouse gas production of temperature, changing precipitation, and extreme climatic events. For
example, increased temperature can stimulate microbial activity and carbon dioxide production. Indirect effects result from climate-driven changes in
plant productivity and vegetation structure, which alter soil physicochemical conditions, the supply of carbon to soil in the form of root exudates and
litter, and the structure and activity of microbial communities involved in carbon cycling . Autotrophs, such as plants, can convert carbon dioxide
into organic carbon, whereas heterotrophs do the opposite. DOC, dissolved organic carbon. Adapted from Bardgett et al., 2008 [2].

ecosystem carbon input [4]. Given that tundra soils are
among the world’s largest carbon stores, these studies
indicate that global warming may cause a large and long-
lasting increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in the
global climate system. In general, there remains much
uncertainty about how soil organisms directly respond
to warming. For instance, it is unclear whether increases
in microbial activity and carbon cycling in response to
warming will be sustained due to short-term depletion of

fast-cycling soil carbon pools, or whether soil commu-
nities will adapt to a warmer world [5,6]. Resolving this
issue represents a major challenge.

Of more relevance to the thesis of this paper are studies
that reveal the potential for climate change to have a strong
indirect effect on soil microbes and carbon cycling, by
affecting plants. Two main mechanisms operate here. First,
rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide

indirectly stimulate soil microbes via increased plant
photosynthesis and transfer of photosynthetic carbon to
soil; and second,
long-term, climate change-induced
changes in the composition and diversity of vegetation
alter the amount and quality of organic matter entering
soil, as well as other soil properties, affecting the activity
and structure of belowground communities.

Recent studies reveal that both of these mechanisms have
significant consequences for the carbon cycle of terrestrial
ecosystems under climate change. For example, a study by
Drake et al. [7] showed that elevated carbon dioxide
concentrations caused an increase in carbon flow through
the plant root–microbial–soil system of a low fertility pine
forest in North Carolina, USA. Specifically, they found that
elevated carbon dioxide increased the flux of carbon to
plant roots, which in turn stimulated microbial activity
and the breakdown of organic matter in the soil. Because
this process also stimulated the release of nitrogen in the
soil and its uptake by trees, it set in motion a positive
feedback mechanism that increased rates of tree produc-
tion, and hence carbon storage in tree biomass, but not in
soil. A related study by Philips et al. [8] investigated the
mechanisms behind this carbon cascade: over a period of
3 years, elevated carbon dioxide concentrations increased
the rate of exudation from tree roots by 55%, leading to a
50% annual increase in soluble organic inputs to soil.
Moreover, this increase in root-derived carbon in the soil
was strongly linked to an increased microbial release of
extracellular enzymes involved in breakdown of organic
nitrogen. This suggests that plant root exudates stimulated
microbial activity and accelerated the rate of soil organic
nitrogen turnover. However, under different conditions,
especially when nitrogen is strongly limiting, it is also
possible for enhanced plant root exudation to stimulate
microbial immobilization of nitrogen, which in turn
limits nitrogen availability to plants [9], plant growth, and
ultimately carbon transfer to soil. Importantly, enhanced
root exudation, in response to elevated carbon dioxide,
can also stimulate mineralization of both recent and old
soil organic carbon (i.e., priming), thereby leading to
carbon loss from soil [10,11], and can increase the growth
of mycorrhizal fungi [12,13]. Changes in mycorrhizal
fungi growth can in turn alter the release of carbon to the
soil microbial community [14], and enhance the stabiliza-
tion of soil organic carbon through promotion of soil
aggregation [15,16]. Collectively, these studies show that
long-term responses of forests to elevated carbon dioxide
are strongly influenced by plant–microbial–soil feedbacks
that are fuelled by plant root exudate-derived inputs of
carbon to soil. Moreover, they bolster the growing view
that transfers of recently fixed carbon from roots to the
belowground subsystem are a major influence on soil
food webs, and that this has major consequences for the

functioning of terrestrial ecosystems in response to climate
change.

There has also been progress in understanding the second
long-term mechanism of climate change modulation of
plant–soil feedbacks. Evidence is emerging that climate
change can cause both local and regional shifts in vegeta-
tion composition through altered precipitation patterns,
temperature regimes, and elevated carbon dioxide con-
centrations [1]. Recent studies indicate that such shifts in
vegetation composition can in turn have implications for
the transfer of recent photosynthetic carbon to soil and
thus affect ecosystem carbon dynamics. For example, in
situ 13CO2 stable isotope labeling approaches [17] showed
that selective removal of key components of the vegetation
of a dwarf-shrub heath strongly affected belowground
transfer and respiration of recently photosynthetic carbon.
In particular, the removal of dwarf shrubs greatly increased
community-level rates of photosynthesis, the transfer of
this recently assimilated carbon to soil, and its loss to the
atmosphere through soil respiration, thereby speeding up
rates of carbon cycling. There is growing evidence from a
variety of ecosystem types that plant functional groups and
species differentially influence the uptake and transfer of
carbon to soil via their exudates, suggesting that changes
in vegetation composition resulting from global change
have the potential to alter short-term patterns of carbon
exchange [17-19]. In general, however, there are more
questions than answers on this topic, and an important
challenge for the future will be to improve our under-
standing of the role of such plant–soil feedbacks in
modifying ecosystem carbon dynamics, especially given
the extent that climate-mediated changes in vegetation are
occurring worldwide.

Plant–soil feedbacks and climate mitigation
A major global challenge is to increase the amount of
carbon sequestered in soil in order to mitigate climate
change. Much discussion in this area has focused on
management of arable and degraded soils to increase
carbon sequestration, and the potential for forest soils to
sequester carbon. Recent evidence, however, suggests that
modifying plant–soil feedbacks in grassland may be an
obvious route to enhance soil carbon stocks, whilst reaping
additional benefits for biodiversity conservation. For
example,
in model grassland systems it was shown
that
increasing grassland plant diversity enhances
community-level carbon dioxide uptake and belowground
allocation to roots and mycorrhizal fungi [20,21], which is
a key mechanism governing carbon sequestration in soil
[22]. These effects, however, were due to the presence of
legumes in high diversity mixtures rather than diversity per
se. Consistent with this finding, the introduction of
legumes into long-term diversity restoration grasslands

in northern England enhanced soil carbon sequestration,
most likely because of increased input of carbon and
nitrogen to soil and suppression of extracellular enzyme
activities involved in organic matter breakdown [23].
Combined with results from other experimental grasslands
[24-26], these findings point to potential benefits for soil
carbon sequestration of restoring plant diversity. Further
research is needed to exploit this approach, especially since
restoration of high diversity grassland on degraded and ex-
arable land is as key objective of policy for sustainable
agriculture in many parts of the world.

The mechanisms involved in plant modulation of soil
carbon sequestration are complex and involve a myriad
of biotic interactions between plants, their symbionts

(i.e., mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria), and
decomposer organisms, whose activities determine the rate
of decomposition of organic matter and hence carbon
loss from soil. De Deyn et al. [22] proposed a simplified
plant trait-based framework for understanding linkages
between plant communities, the microbial community,
and soil carbon sequestration (Figure 2). This framework is
consistent with the growing recognition that plant traits are
major influences on soil nutrient and carbon cycling, and
that certain plant traits can select for particular groups of
soil organisms that play key roles in these processes [1]. For
instance, a recent study of a range of grassland plant species
showed that certain root traits, such as root carbon and
nitrogen content, were strongly correlated with several soil
properties, especially the biomass and composition of the

The schematic shows the interdependency of labile and recalcitrant litter inputs to soil, which drive abundances of different functional groups of the soil
microbial community and their involvement in carbon sequestration. Labile inputs to soil of low carbon:nitrogen ratio from litter and root exudates favor
saprophytic (feeding, absorbing or growing upon decaying matter) bacterial-dominated microbial communities that promote carbon mineralization, and hence
carbon loss. In contrast, recalcitrant litter inputs with high carbon:nitrogen ratio and low nutrient availability favor saprophytic fungi and carbon allocation to
symbiotic fungi and bacteria, which both promote carbon storage in soil. Solid lines indicate carbon and dotted lines indicate mineral nitrogen and phosphorus
flow. Overall, the stability and storage of carbon in soil increases along the spectrum from saprophytic- to symbiotic-based cycling, as indicated on the lower

microbial community [27]. Also, in a study of 16 grass-
land plant species, it was shown that increased root
nitrogen concentration slowed down the decomposition of
recalcitrant soil organic matter, whereas increasing plant
biomass enhanced rates of decomposition [28]. But,
specific plant traits such as differences in the quantity
and chemical composition of root exudates are also likely
to affect the mineralization of soil carbon by altering
microbial activity [28]. These studies suggest that plant
traits, and especially those of roots, offer a potential tool for
predicting how changes in plant species composition
associated with global change will affect the Earth [1].
Moreover, given the importance of root traits for soil
microbial carbon cycling, modification of root traits of
crops, including the development of perennial grains with
greater root mass and depth, may offer a way to maximize
soil carbon sequestration whilst also producing food
[29,30].

Conclusions and future challenges
I have used a selection of examples, but their central
message is similar: understanding ecosystem function and
response to global change requires consideration of feed-
backs between plants, microbes, and soil processes. In
particular, it is clear that plant root carbon transfer to
the soil and resulting carbon cascades through the plant–
microbial–soil system play a primary role in driving
carbon-cycle feedbacks and in regulating ecosystem
responses to climate change. Moreover, recent studies
identify the potential to apply such understanding to
improve land management, such as enhancing soil carbon
sequestration in grassland and degraded farming systems,
which also has potential benefits for food production and
biodiversity conservation. Research effort is also required
in order to realize the potential for targeted crop improve-
ment strategies based on root traits that favor carbon
sequestration in soil whilst also producing food. A new age
of research and funding is needed to meet these scientific
challenges and to integrate such understanding into future
land management and climate mitigation strategies.
