While many efforts have been made to improve reprogramming efﬁciency, signiﬁcant problems such as genomic instability of iPSCs need to be addressed before clinical therapy.
In this study, we try to ﬁgure out the real genomic state of iPSCs and their DNA damage response to ionizing radiation (IR).
We found that iPSC line 3FB4-1 had lower DNA damage repair ability than mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast (MEF) cells, from which 3FB4-1line was derived.
After the introduction of DNA damage by IR, the number of c-H2AX foci in 3FB4-1 increased modestly compared to a large increase seen in MEF, albeit both signiﬁcantly (P   0.01).
In addition, whole-genome sequencing analysis showed that after IR, 3FB4-1 possessed more point mutations than MEF and the point mutations spread all over chromosomes.
These observations provide evidence that iPSCs are more sensitive to ionizing radiation and their relatively low DNA damage repair capacity may account for their high radiosensitivity.
The compromised DNA damage repair capacity of iPSCs should be considered when used in clinical therapy.
Introduction  Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) maintain pluripotency and are capable of differentiating into all somatic cell types, which thus may be used to treat some diseases [1].
However, the clinical applications of ESCs have been limited due to the ethical con- cerns.

ESC-like pluripotent stem cells, termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), through the introduction of four transcrip- tion factors (Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4) into mouse somatic cells.
The generated iPSCs are similar to ESCs in terms of mor- phology, gene expression, epigenetic status and in vitro differ- entiation capability [2].
Recent studies have been focused on the development of techniques for enhancing reprogramming efﬁciency, such as retrovirus-mediated introduction of tran- scription factors, lentiviral transduction, adenoviral infection, transient plasmid delivery, protein transduction system, and mRNA-mediated introduction [3 8].
However, evidence shows that genomic instability arises in generated iPSCs, which would affect their clinical applications [9 12].

In addition, the reprogramming process in iPSCs is often incomplete because donor cells inﬂuence iPSCs in both transcriptional and epigenetic proper- ties [9,10,12,14,15].
The level of copy number variations (CNVs) also increases in the early-passage iPSC lines, and most of the de novo CNVs result from the replication stress during the reprogramming process [16,17].
Another study shows that the absence of p53 increases the efﬁciency of repro- gramming.
However, it also raises the possibility of DNA damage and genomic instability accompanying the reprogram- ming process [18].
These ﬁndings suggest that iPSCs are more likely to harbor genomic abnormalities.
Therefore, more attention should be paid to the genomic status of iPSCs before they are used in clinical therapy [19].
We introduced DNA damage through ionizing radiation (IR) to investigate whether the difference in DNA damage re- pair capacity of iPSCs, compared to mouse embryonic ﬁbro- blast (MEF) cells, is responsible for the genomic instability.
Our results show that iPSC line 3FB4-1 is more sensitive to DNA damage due to their lower DNA damage repair ability.
These ﬁndings would provide a novel insight into the genome instability of iPSCs.
Results  iPSCs display low DNA damage repair ability after IR  analysis  showed that  Previous studies demonstrated that DNA repair mechanisms play an important role in maintaining genomic stability [20  23].
We hypothesized that the genome instability of iPSCs is due to low DNA damage repair ability.
To test this hypothesis, we treated mouse iPSC line 3FB4-1 and somatic MEF cells, from which 3FB4-1line was derived, with IR.
IR can result in double strand breaks (DSBs), which are the most detrimen- tal DNA lesions [24 26].
DSBs occur during the programmed genome rearrangement process and normal cell metabolism, and can cause genome abnormalities, apoptosis and senes- cence, if not repaired properly [27].
Our pilot time-course stud- ies indicated that DNA damage response was evident 4 h after treatment with IR at 4 grays (data not shown).
Immunoblot- ting ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), which is essential for the initiation of DNA repair [28], underwent auto-phosphorylation and became activated after IR (Figure 1A and B).
In addition, levels of c-H2AX, the phosphorylated form of histone variant H2AX, which is a DSB marker, were differentially altered between 3FB4-1 and MEF.
For 3FB4-1, the number of c-H2AX foci per nu- cleus signiﬁcantly increased in cells treated with IR at 4 grays (Gy), compared to the untreated controls (12   0.7 vs 8   1, P   0.01).
Signiﬁcant increase in the number of c-H2AX focus was also observed for the MEF cells treated with the same dos- age of IR in comparison with the control cells.
However, a much greater fold of increase was revealed for the MEF cells (20   0.6 vs 1   0.5, P   0.01) (Figure 1C E).
The relatively modest increase in the number of c-H2AX focus for iPSC line 3FB4-1 suggests that compared to MEF cells, iPSCs may have a low DNA damage repair capacity and that they are likely more sensitive to DNA damage.
Whole-genome sequencing of iPSCs and MEFs  To further evaluate the outcomes of differential DNA damage repair ability, we performed whole-genome DNA sequencing and single nucleotide variation (SNV) analysis for 3FB4-1 and MEF cells with (IR+) or without IR (IR ) treatment.
3FB4-1 cells were collected through the gelatin re-suspension method to eliminate the possible contamination of feeder cells.
For all four samples, more than 6.3   108 reads per sample were generated and analyzed (Table 1).
We obtained DNA se- quences of  64 Gb per sample, and the amount of sequence data covered 25-fold and higher of each genome.
Therefore, we were conﬁdent to detect true mutations for each sample.
SNV analysis reveals more point mutations present in iPSCs after IR  We used Burrows Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA) [29] and Samtools Sequence Alignment/Map tool [30] to map the mouse reference genome sequence (mm9), and used VarScan [31] to call total SNVs for each sample.
Approximately 2.9  4.2   106 SNVs were detected in each sample (Table 1).
When sequence variation was directly compared between 3FB4-1 (IR ) and 3FB4-1 (IR+), or MEF (IR ) and MEF (IR+), about 908,296 likely SNVs were found in 3FB4-1 after IR, whereas only 183,518 SNVs were found in MEF (Table 1).
the number of mutations  To further investigate the functions of SNVs indentiﬁed in 3FB4-1 and MEF after IR, we focused on SNVs that were not present in the dbSNP database (SNP128, downloaded from UCSC).
By ﬁltering the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) available in dbSNP, we identiﬁed the point mutations for each sample (Table 1).
Results showed that compared to non-treated counterpart, for 3FB4-1 cells increased sharply after IR, from 494,616 to 936,728, whereas the number of mutations barely increased for MEF cells, from 1,243,249 to 1,312,621 (Table 1 and Figure 2).
In 3FB4-1 cells, 302,226 SNVs were commonly found in both 3FB4-1 (IR ) and 3FB4-1 (IR+) cells, whereas 634,502 SNVs were uniquely recovered from 3FB4-1 (IR+) cells.
Conversely, 327,625 SNVs were uniquely recovered from MEF (IR+), while MEF (IR ) and MEF (IR+) shared more common SNVs (984,996 SNVs).
These data indicated that more IR-induced SNVs were present in 3FB4-1 cells than in MEF cells.
Next, we examined the chromosomal distribution of the IR- induced point mutations in 3FB4-1 and MEF.
Our analysis indicated that point mutations spread all over chromosomes.
And no enrichment of point mutations was observed in any speciﬁc chromosomes.
For 3FB4-1 cells, the number of point mutations increased markedly in each chromosome (Figure 3A, Table S1).
However, compared to non-irradiated controls, number of point mutations increased approximately 3 6% in each chromosome for MEF cells after IR (Figure 3B, Table S1).
For example, on Chromosome 10, the number of mutations increased 356% in 3FB4-1 cells, but only 4.91% in MEF cells after IR (Table S1).
Point mutations in known functional elements of the genome  The point mutations found in the 3FB4-1 and MEF cells after IR were further classiﬁed to identify functional relevance.

In addition, there were a few point mutations found in the 50 untranslated regions (50UTRs) and 30UTRs, and several in the splice site (2-nt near exon boundary) (Figure 4, Table S2).
Next, we focused on point mutations in coding regions especially.
Compared to non-irradiated cells, there were 2256 and 949 synonymous point mutations in 3FB4-1 and in MEF,  respectively, after IR.
Additionally, 1454 and 724 nonsynony- mous point mutations were revealed in IR-treated 3FB4-1 and MEF, respectively.
However, the number of nonsense muta- tions in the coding regions was comparable for 3FB4-1 and MEF after IR.
These results indicated that the remarkable changes in irradiated 3FB4-1, which are consistent with our ﬁnding that iPSCs have lower DNA damage repair ability and are more sensitive to DNA damage.

Discussion  Previous research has focused on the reprogramming pro- cesses to improve the efﬁciency of iPSCs generation.
How- ever, less attention has been paid to the genomic status of  iPSCs [32 34].
Recently, several studies reported that iPSCs are more likely to harbor genomic abnormalities [35,36] and the observed genomic aberrations may result from the repro- gramming process [16,37].
DNA repair mechanisms are essen- tial for maintaining genomic stability of cells as well [20 23].
324  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 320 326  To test whether the altered DNA repair ability is responsible for genomic instability of iPSCs, we introduced DSBs to so- matic cell line MEF, iPSC line 3FB4-1derived from MEF and ESC line E14 through IR.
By immunoﬂuorescence and immunoblotting analysis, we found that 3FB4-1 had more c-H2AX foci than E14 and MEF, even without irradiation (current study and data not shown).
However, 3FB4-1 had a relative low increase in the number of c-H2AX focus com- pared to E14 and MEF after IR (current study and data not shown).
In the present study, we compared MEF and 3FB4-1 in terms of DNA damage response.
The results accumulated in this study suggest that iPSCs were more sensitive to IR due to their low DNA damage repair ability.
In normal situations, iPSCs could accurately repair DSBs mostly through the homologous recombination (HR) path- way [38].
Somatic cells mostly adopt the error prone non- homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway to repair DNA damage [39].
This difference in repair mechanism may explain the lower basal mutation rate in 3FB4-1 compared to MEF.
However, when DSBs were introduced by IR, 3FB4-1 showed higher sensitivity to DNA damage than MEF, which may be one important indicator of genomic instability for iPSCs.
Therefore, likely, we could improve the genomic stability of iPSCs through regulation of the DNA damage repair re- sponse to reduce the risk of tumor formation prior to use in clinical therapy.
However, further studies would be neces- sary to identify genes that are mutated during IR and to eventually ﬁnd the mechanism underlying the sensitivity of iPSCs to DNA damage, which could be approached, for example, by comparing the DNA repair capability of more cell types including iPSCs, ESCs and other somatic cells.
Materials and methods  Cell lines and cell culture  Mouse iPSC line 3FB4-1 was cultured in Dulbecoo s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco, Grand Island, New York, USA) supplemented with 15% Embryonic Stem Cell Fetal Bo- vine Serum (ES Cell FBS  Gibco, New Zealand), 1% MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (MEM NEAA  Grand Island, New York, USA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, New York, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine solution (Gibco, Grand Island, New York, USA), 103 units/ml medium Mouse Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF  Millopore, Temecula, CA, USA), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, Grand Island, New York, USA) [40].
Medium was changed daily and the iPSCs were passaged every two days using Trypsin 0.25% Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Beijing, China).
MEF cells were cultured in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Beijing, China) supplemented with 15% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scien- tiﬁc, Beijing, China) and 1% NEAA, 1% penicillin/streptomy- cin [41].
Irradiation  Cells were passaged one day before IR and were irradiated with 4 Gy of c-irradiation using a cobalt irradiator.
After IR, cells were returned to the incubator immediately and cul- tured for 4 more hours before further analysis.

Proteins were separated by SDS PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
The blots were incubated with primary antibodies against p- ATM (1:1000, R&D Systems, MN, USA), ATM (1:3000  Gene Tex, San Diego, CA, USA), b-actin (1:3000, Beyotime Biotech).
After washing in 1  PBS three times, blots were incubated with antibody conjugated with HRP (1:3000  Gene Tex, San Diego, CA, USA) and anti rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (1:3000  Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), respectively.
Finally, blots were washed and bands were visualized by the Image Quant ECL equipment (GE healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
anti mouse  secondary  an  cH2AX immunoﬂuoresence  Figure 4 Distribution of IR-induced point mutations in known functional elements The IR-induced point mutations in 3FB4-1 (A) and MEF (B) genome were analyzed according to known functional elements: intergenic regions, introns, 50UTRs, 30UTRs, splice site and coding regions  the point mutations residing within coding regions were further analyzed based on variant type: synonymous, nonsynony- mous and nonsense.
Cells were passaged on slides one day before IR.
After expo- sure to 0 or 4 Gy of c-irradiation, cells were put back into the incubator at 37  C. Four hours later, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and ﬁxed with 4% parafor- maldehyde for 10 min at room temperature.
After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized for 10 min in 0.05% Tri- ton X-100 and 0.5% NP-40, followed by washing in PBS for 3 times (5 min each).
Slides with cells were blocked with 2%   Zhang M et al / Increased Genomic Instability in iPSCs  325  BSA for 1 h and then incubated with mouse anti-cH2AX antibody (1:500  Millipore, CA, USA) for 1 h at room tem- perature.
After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for three times, the goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:800, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was applied for incu- bation for 1 h in the dark at room temperature, at the same time, slides were stained with 0.2 mg/ml of 40,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole (DAPI, 1:2000  Sigma, Shanghai, China).
Con- focal images were acquired and analyzed on Leica TCS SP5 (Leica) equipped with HCX PL 63   1.4 oil CS immersion objective.
DNA extraction  iPSCs 3FB4-1 cells were digested using Trypsin 0.25% solution and resuspended in gelatin-coated dishes.
After incubation at 37  C for 10 30 min, the supernatant was transferred into a 15 ml centrifuge tube to collect the cell precipitate by centrifu- gation at 1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.
Then DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hil- den, Germany) as instructed by the manufacturer.
Whole-genome sequencing  Whole genome DNA libraries suitable for sequencing on Illu- mina s sequencing platform were generated from 5 lg of geno- mic DNA.
The DNA was sheared to approximately 300  500 bp with a Covaris S220 (Life Technologies, USA).
The li- braries were sequenced on HiSeq2000 DNA Sequencer (Illu- mina).
In addition, to reduce the false positive errors in library preparations and sequencing process, we prepare the four samples in parallel and sequenced them within one ﬂow- cell (two lanes per sample).
SNV analysis  Sequencing data were mapped to mouse reference genome se- quence (mm9) and SNVs were called using VarScan software (min-coverage 10, min-reads 2, min-avq-qual 20, min-var-freq 0.20, P value 0.99) [31].
The dbSNP database (SNP128) was downloaded from UCSC (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).
