Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease
(HFMD). Infection with EV71 is occasionally associated with severe neurological diseases
such as acute encephalitis, acute ﬂaccid paralysis, and cardiopulmonary failure. Because
cellular receptors for viruses play an important role in cell, tissue, and species tropism, it is
important to identify and characterize the receptor molecule. Recently, cellular receptors
and host factors that stimulate EV71 infection have been identiﬁed. Several lines of evi-
dence suggest that scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) plays critical roles in
efﬁcient EV71 infection and the development of disease in humans. In this review, we will
summarize the ﬁndings of recent studies on EV71 infection and on the roles of SCARB2.

INTRODUCTION
Human enteroviruses (HEVs) are a large family of human
pathogens belonging to the Picornaviridae family, and these
viruses can cause a variety of diseases. HEVs are classiﬁed into
four groups, species A (HEV-A) to species D (HEV-D). HEV-A
is composed of at least 16 members of different serotypes: Cox-
sackievirus (CV) A2, CVA3, CVA4, CVA5, CVA6, CVA7, CVA8,
CVA10, CVA12, CVA14, CVA16, Enterovirus 71 (EV71), EV76,
EV89, EV90, and EV91 (Pallansch and Roos, 2007). The num-
ber of isolated and characterized HEV-A viruses is continually
increasing (Oberste et al., 2007, 2008). Members of HEV-A are
known to be causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease
(HFMD), herpangina, respiratory disease, meningitis, and polio-
like ﬂaccid paralysis (Pallansch and Roos, 2007). EV71 and CVA16
are the major causative agents of HFMD. HFMD is normally a
mild disease, but HFMD caused by EV71 is sometimes associated
with severe neurological diseases such as acute fatal encephali-
tis, polio-like acute ﬂaccid paralysis, and neurogenic pulmonary
edema (Schmidt et al., 1974; Chumakov et al., 1979a,b; Melnick,
1984; Ho et al., 1999; Chan et al., 2000). Recently, large outbreaks of
EV71 associated with severe neurological diseases have occurred
repeatedly in the Asia-Paciﬁc region (Ho et al., 1999; Komatsu
et al., 1999; Ahmad, 2000; Chan et al., 2000; McMinn et al., 2001a,b;
Fujimoto et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2002; De et al., 2011). EV71 has
become a serious public health concern (Qiu, 2008).

Virus infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to a cel-
lular receptor at the surface of a susceptible cell. Cellular receptors
for viruses therefore play important roles in determining the cell,
tissue, and species tropism and pathogenicity of viruses (Bergel-
son, 2010). Thus, the identiﬁcation and characterization of the
cellular receptor for EV71 are important steps in the elucidation
of the pathogenicity of EV71. Recently, several research groups
identiﬁed cellular receptors and host factors that enhance EV71
infection (Nishimura et al., 2009; Yamayoshi et al., 2009; Yang
et al., 2009, 2011; Han et al., 2010). Herein, we will summarize the

importance of scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) as
a receptor for EV71.

IDENTIFICATION OF SCARB2 AS A RECEPTOR FOR EV71
Monolayer cultures of primate cells such as RD cells and Vero
cells are susceptible to EV71 strains, and these cells are often
used for the isolation of EV71 from clinical specimens (Mizuta
et al., 2005, 2009). Mouse cells, such as L929 cells, are generally not
highly susceptible to EV71 infection. Only residual virus antigen-
positive cells are observed, even if the mouse cells are infected at a
high multiplicity of infection. This species-speciﬁc restriction of
EV71 infection is due to the absence on mouse cells of the cel-
lular receptor that permits viral entry into cells. Yamayoshi et al.
(2009) employed a strategy to identify the human EV71 receptor;
this strategy is outlined in Figure 1. These researchers transfected
human genomic DNA into mouse L929 cells and succeeded in
selecting two L929 cell lines, Ltr051 and Ltr246, that became sus-
ceptible to EV71 among approximately 70,000 transformed cells.
The integrated human gene(s) are expected to encode the EV71
receptor.

One of the transformed cell lines, Ltr051, was highly suscep-
tible to EV71, with an infection efﬁciency similar to that of RD
cells, whereas the other cell line, Ltr246, was susceptible to EV71
but with a lower efﬁciency. By microarray analysis of the RNAs
expressed in the transformant cells, it was shown that Ltr051 cells
carried the gene for human SCARB2. L929 cells that expressed
SCARB2 constitutively (L-SCARB2 cells) were susceptible to all
EV71 strains tested, irrespective of the sub-genogroup. EV71 infec-
tion in RD cells was inhibited both by anti-SCARB2 antibodies and
by soluble SCARB2. The human and monkey cell lines that are
EV71-susceptible cells expressed SCARB2. These results suggest
that SCARB2 plays a critical role in the EV71 infection pathway.
In addition, Yamayoshi et al. (2009) found that CVA16 also uses
SCARB2 as a receptor, suggesting that SCARB2 serves as a receptor
for other HEV-As that cause HFMD.

SCARB2 and EV71 infection

et al., 2003). SCARB2 is one of the most abundant proteins in
the lysosomal membrane and participates in membrane trans-
portation and the reorganization of the endosomal/lysosomal
compartment (Kuronita et al., 2002; Eskelinen et al., 2003; Blanz
et al., 2010). SCARB2 shuttles between these compartments and
the plasma membrane (Figure 2B, left; Eskelinen et al., 2003).
SCARB2 is a type III double-transmembrane protein with a large
extracellular domain (when it is present at the cell surface) and
short cytoplasmic domains at the amino- and carboxy-terminus
(Figure 2A; Calvo et al., 1995). SCARB2 is expressed in a vari-
ety of tissues, including neurons in the CNS. SCARB2 deﬁciency
in mice causes ureteric pelvic junction obstruction, deafness, and
peripheral neuropathy, and SCARB2 deﬁciency in humans causes
action myoclonus–renal failure syndrome (AMRF; Gamp et al.,
2003; Berkovic et al., 2008).

Mouse SCARB2 exhibits 85.8% amino acid identity with
human SCARB2 (Figure 2A). Using chimeric mutants that include
human and mouse SCARB2 sequences, Yamayoshi and Koike
(2011) mapped the region that was important for efﬁcient EV71
binding and infection. L929 cells expressing chimeras that carried
amino acids 142–204 from the human sequence were susceptible
to EV71, whereas chimeras that carried the mouse sequence in
this region were not susceptible. It was shown that this region is
also critical for binding to the virion. This region of the SCARB2
protein exhibits 76.2% amino acid identity between the human
and mouse sequences. Removal of the carbohydrate moiety of
the recombinant soluble SCARB2 protein by PNGase F treatment
did not abolish the binding of the virus to the receptor, suggest-
ing that the protein moiety of human SCARB2 plays a critical
role in binding. Recently, Chen et al. (2012) identiﬁed critical
residues required for human SCARB2 binding to EV71, which was
comprised of residues 144–151 in a highly variable region among
species. On the viral proteins, they showed that amino acids lined
on the wall of the canyon (the EF loop of VP1) were important for
SCARB2 binding and viral infectivity (Chen et al., 2012). To eluci-
date the mode of interaction of EV71 and SCARB2 more precisely,
crystallographic analysis will be needed.

MECHANISM OF EV71 INFECTION IN RD CELLS
Hussain et al. (2011) have performed a screen of host factors
required for EV71 entry into RD cells using an siRNA library.
They found that the repression of genes associated with clathrin-
mediated endocytosis, including AP2A1, ARRB1, CLTC, CLTCL1,
SYNJ1, ARPC5, PAK1, ROCK1, and WASF1, resulted in signiﬁcant
inhibition of EV71 infection. They observed both co-localization
of EV71 with clathrin using an immunoﬂuorescence assay and
virions in clathrin-coated pits by electron microscopy. EV71
entry into cells was inhibited when a dominant-negative mutant
of Eps15, which binds to AP-2, was expressed and when cells
were treated with drugs that selectively inhibit clathrin-dependent
endocytosis (chlorpromazine and cytochalasin B). Entry was not
inhibited by drugs that inhibit caveolae-dependent endocytosis
and macropinocytosis. Hussain et al. also showed that EV71 infec-
tion was abolished when cells were treated with drugs that inhibit
acidiﬁcation of the endosome (Baﬁlomycin A1 and concanamycin
A). Taken together, these results suggest that the mechanism of
EV71 infection is that which is summarized in Figure 2B (right).

FIGURE 1 | The strategy to identify the human EV71 receptor, SCARB2.
Mouse L929 cells became susceptible to EV71 when a human genomic
DNA (red) was integrated into the genome (Ltr051 cells). RNA was
prepared from Ltr051 cells and parental L929 cells and labeled with Cy3 or
Cy5, respectively. The labeled RNAs were competitively hybridized to a
microarray for human transcriptome analysis. The RNA species that were
expressed in the Ltr051 cells but not in L929 cells were selected as
candidates for the receptor mRNA. Each candidate was expressed in
mouse L929 cells to examine the EV71 susceptibility of the transfected
cells. SCARB2 expression alone was sufﬁcient to achieve susceptibility.

The other cell line, Ltr246, is susceptible to a subset of EV71
strains but not all strains. Despite all of the efforts undertaken to
identify the gene that is integrated in this cell line and that sup-
ports EV71 infection, this gene has not yet been identiﬁed. Other
research groups have proposed that molecules act as receptors
or other entities to enhance EV71 infection (see Mini Review by
Nishimura and Shimizu, submitted). However, infection mediated
by P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) or by an unknown
molecule expressed in Ltr246 cells is not as efﬁcient as infection
mediated by SCARB2. Infection with EV71 in L929 cells expressing
PSGL-1 was successful only for a subset of EV71 strains (Miya-
mura et al., 2011). SCARB2 seems to play the most important role
in EV71 infection in vitro and in vivo because SCARB2 serves as a
receptor for all EV71 strains and is expressed in the sites of EV71
replication in vivo.

STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF SCARB2
Scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (also known as Lysoso-
mal Integral Membrane Protein II, LGP85 or CD36b like-2) is
composed of 478 amino acids and belongs to the CD36 family,
which includes CD36 and scavenger receptor B, member 1 (SR-
BI and its splicing variant SR-BII; Calvo et al., 1995; Eskelinen

SCARB2 and EV71 infection

is involved in this pathway. The involvement of SCARB2 in this
pathway should be conﬁrmed experimentally.

It is known that the poliovirus receptor (CD155) and the major
group rhinovirus receptor (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) are
able to bind poliovirus and rhinovirus, respectively, and induce
a conformational change that leads to the uncoating of the viral
genome. Chen et al. (2012) reported that SCARB2, but not PSGL-
1, induced a conformational change from native 160S virions to
135S particles. The change was enhanced under an acidic environ-
ment (pH 5.6; Chen et al., 2012). It should be further determined
whether SCARB2 induces a conformational change to empty
capsids and whether VP4 is released during SCARB2-mediated
conformational change.

ANIMAL MODEL OF EV71 INFECTION
To study the neuropathogenicity of EV71, experiments using live
animals are essential. The most reliable animal model is the mon-
key model (Hashimoto et al., 1978; Chumakov et al., 1979b;
Hashimoto and Hagiwara, 1982; Hagiwara et al., 1983, 1984;
Nagata et al., 2002, 2004; Arita et al., 2005, 2007; Zhang et al.,
2011) because the species barrier caused by receptor differences is
not a critical problem. The localization patterns of EV71-induced
lesions in monkeys after intraspinal and intravenous inoculation
were highly consistent with those observed in humans with severe
EV71 encephalitis at autopsy (Lum et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1999;
Chan et al., 2000; Shieh et al., 2001). Infected monkeys showed
acute ﬂaccid paralysis, which is a sign of involvement of the
pyramidal tract, and tremor and ataxia, which are signs of involve-
ment of the extrapyramidal tract. Histopathological changes were
observed in the cerebellar and pontine vestibular nuclei, and in the
spinal cord. Although the monkey is an excellent model for study
of EV71 neuropathogenicity, monkey models have disadvantages
with respect to handling, ethics, and cost. Experiments to identify
the virulence determinants in the EV71 genome are limited to one
report (Arita et al., 2005).

EV71, like other CVAs, is able to infect suckling mice. Some
investigators use the suckling mouse model (Chumakov et al.,
1979b; Chen et al., 2004; Ong et al., 2008). A problem with this
system is that mice lose susceptibility to EV71 as they age (Yu
et al., 2000; Chua et al., 2008). To circumvent this problem, some
research groups have isolated mouse-adapted EV71 (Wang et al.,
2004, 2011; Chua et al., 2008). Khong et al. (2012) found that 2-
week-old mice deﬁcient in type I and type II interferon receptors
are susceptible to EV71 strains that were not artiﬁcially adapted
to mice. Because mouse SCARB2 and PSGL-1 do not function
as EV71 receptors in mice (Nishimura et al., 2009; Yamayoshi
et al., 2009; Yamayoshi and Koike, 2011), EV71 infection in suck-
ling mice is mediated by an unknown mechanism distinct from
the SCARB2- and PSGL-1-mediated mechanisms. Indeed, EV71
exhibits different tissue tropism in suckling mice than in humans.
In addition to infecting the CNS, EV71 replicates efﬁciently in the
muscle of mice, unlike in humans (Chen et al., 2004; Wang et al.,
2004; Chua et al., 2008; Ong et al., 2008).

In poliovirus, critical nucleotides or amino acids that inﬂuence
the neurovirulence have been reported (Evans et al., 1985; Omata
et al., 1986; Kawamura et al., 1989; Westrop et al., 1989). To identify
such neurovirulence determinants in EV71, attempts were made

FIGURE 2 | Scavenger receptor class B, member 2 and EV71 infection
in RD cells. (A) Comparison of the structures of human and mouse
SCARB2. The human and mouse SCARB2 proteins are type III
transmembrane proteins consisting of 478 amino acids. The amino acid
identity of human SCARB2 to mouse SCARB2 is 85.8%. Because mouse
SCARB2 does not serve an efﬁcient receptor, it is possible to identify the
virus binding site using chimeric receptors including mouse and human
sequences. The 63-amino-acid region that is encoded in exon 4 of the
human SCARB2 gene plays an essential role in EV71 binding and infection.
(B) Mechanism of EV71 infection in RD cells. The SCARB2 protein is
located in the lysosomal and endosomal compartments and shuttles to the
plasma membrane. This protein is able to bind EV71 when present at the
cell surface. Hussain et al. (2011) have shown that EV71 infection is
dependent on the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway by knockdown of
the expression of proteins that participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
EV71 infection is also inhibited when cells are treated with drugs that block
acidiﬁcation of the endosome.

EV71 infection has been shown to be sensitive to the disruption
of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the acidic endosomal pH.
Infection of RD cells with EV71 is largely blocked by anti-SCARB2
antibody or soluble SCARB2 (Yamayoshi et al., 2009), suggesting
that the SCARB2-dependent pathway is the main pathway of EV71
infection in RD cells. SCARB2 is also known to be internalized by
clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Le Borgne et al., 2001; Rodionov
et al., 2002). The evidence has not directly shown that SCARB2

SCARB2 and EV71 infection

to determine nucleotide changes that inﬂuence the virulence level
in suckling mice (Arita et al., 2008; Chua et al., 2008; Li et al., 2011;
Huang et al., 2012). Some virulence determinants were mapped
to the capsid region. Because the viral capsid is involved in the
binding to the receptor and in other steps of infection, such as
uncoating and stabilization of the virion, it is difﬁcult to claim
that amino acid changes in the capsid region are responsible for
adaptation or virulence.

One of the strategies that can be used to overcome the prob-
lems discussed above is to generate transgenic mice that express
the human EV71 receptor(s). Transgenic mice expressing human
PVR, CD155, are susceptible to poliovirus and are used for the

study of poliovirus pathogenicity (Ren et al., 1990; Koike et al.,
1991; Horie et al., 1994; Abe et al., 1995). To this end, transgenic
mice that express human PSGL-1 driven by the CMV promoter
were generated (Liu et al., 2011). The expression of human PSGL-
1 by this method was not sufﬁcient to cause disease. It is obvious
that the CMV promoter does not mimic the native PSGL-1 pro-
moter in humans. Transgenic mice that express PSGL-1 with a
distribution identical to that in human tissues are desirable. It
seems that human SCARB2 expression in mice is necessary for the
development of disease. A transgenic mouse model that develops
disease that resembles the severe neurological diseases observed in
humans will greatly contribute to the study of EV71 pathogenicity.
