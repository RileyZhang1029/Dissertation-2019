The interaction of the hemagglutinin (HA) of the inﬂuenza A viruses (IAV) with the cell
surface is a key factor for entry of the virus and productive infection of the cell. This glyco-
protein has afﬁnity for sialic acids (SA), and different strains present speciﬁcity for SA bound
through α2,3 or α2,6 linkages to the underlying sugar chain, which is usually related with
host and cell tropism. Nucleic acid recognizing receptors (mainly RIG-I and Toll-like recep-
tors) are the most extensively studied pattern recognition receptors for IAV. However, due
to the ability of the HA of avian, swine, or human inﬂuenza viruses to bind differently linked
SA and also to the high levels and variability of glycosylations of their major virion glycopro-
tein components, HA and NA, IAV interacting proteins on the cell surface could also play
an important role in initiating different signaling pathways to elicit the immune response in
infected cells. But, at present, these processes are not well understood. In this mini-review
we discuss how the interactions of IAV with cell surface receptors on immune cells might
be important for the induction of speciﬁc innate immune responses and as a result, for
pathogenicity in humans.

INTRODUCTION
Inﬂuenza viruses are an important threat to human health and
global economy, causing an annual average of 36,000 deaths and
over 200,000 hospitalizations during the 1990s (CDC, 2010). In
addition, due to the high frequency of mutations and recombina-
tion of their genome (antigenic drift and shift), and their airborne
transmission, they have a high potential to become pandemic
viruses. Inﬂuenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviri-
dae, and include the types, A, B, and C, from which inﬂuenza
A viruses (IAV) are the responsible for most of the disease
burden (Mubareka and Palese, 2011). IAV have a segmented
negative stranded RNA genome, consisting on 8 segments that
encode up to 12 proteins (Palese and Shaw, 2007; Wise et al.,
2009).

The major glycoproteins present on the surface of the virion
are the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). To date,
16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been described, and the combi-
nation of different subtypes of these proteins results in different
subtypes of IAV (Mubareka and Palese, 2011). The main roles of
the HA are to mediate the interaction of the viral particle with
the cell components on the surface and to promote the fusion of
the viral and endosomal membranes, leading to the release of the

ribonucleoproteins (RNP) into the cytoplasm. The interaction of
inﬂuenza viruses with their receptors is necessary for subsequent
internalization of the virus. Some studies demonstrated that IAV
enter the cell via clathrin mediated endocytosis, although under
certain conditions they can also enter in a caveolin and clathrin
independent manner (Lakadamyali et al., 2004, 2006; De Vries
et al., 2011).

Here we review and discuss how the interaction of IAV with
their receptors on the cell surface of immune cells, such as den-
dritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, might inﬂuence infection and
promote speciﬁc innate immune responses, with important impli-
cations in the outcome of the disease, either promoting viral clear-
ance or generating exacerbated local immune responses resulting
in acute infection and increased pathogenesis.

RECEPTOR SPECIFICITY OF THE IAV
The circulation of IAV is species-speciﬁc, and therefore, transmis-
sion among different species is usually not observed. It is known
that the receptor speciﬁcity has an important role in maintaining
the host species barrier, although other proteins, like PB2, also need
to be adapted for efﬁcient infection of other hosts different than
the original host (Almond, 1977; Neumann and Kawaoka, 2006).
Sialic acids (SA, N -acetylneuraminic acid) are the primary recep-
tors for virus attachment to cell surfaces, binding to a pocket at the
distal tip of the HA of IAV (Weis et al., 1988). SA consist of nine
carbon sugars frequently attached through α2,3 or α2,6 (SAα2,3
or SAα2,6) linkages to underlying sugar chains of glycoproteins
in the cell membrane. It is known that avian and human viruses
differ in their SA binding afﬁnity, since HA from human isolates
usually bind SAα2,6, while the avian isolates usually have afﬁnity

for SAα2,3 (Rogers and Paulson, 1983). Related to this, human
upper respiratory tract present mainly SAα2,6, which is believed
to act as one of the main barriers for transmission of avian IAV to
humans (Shinya et al., 2006; Van Riel et al., 2006; Nicholls et al.,
2007).

High pathogenic avian inﬂuenza viruses (HPAIV) H5N1 are
currently a pandemic threat, and almost 600 people have been
reported to be infected as of November 15, 2011 (WHO, 2011),
resulting in severe pneumonia with a lethal outcome in 60%
of those reported cases. Humans infected with H5N1 present
unusually high serum concentrations of chemokines and pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines, which are thought to contribute to dis-
ease severity (Peiris et al., 2004; De Jong et al., 2006; Maines
et al., 2008; Sirinonthanawech et al., 2011). Although no sus-
tained human-to-human transmission has been established yet,
possibly due to the low levels of SAα2,3 present in the human
airways, HPAIV have been shown to be able to infect and repli-
cate efﬁciently in cells in the lower region of the respiratory tract,
including type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages, where
the avian-like virus receptor is predominant (Shinya et al., 2006;
Van Riel et al., 2006; Nicholls et al., 2007). Therefore, the recep-
tor speciﬁcity of inﬂuenza viruses is important not only for the
host tropism, but also for tissue tropism in humans, since it deter-
mines the airway region and cell types that support active viral
replication, what might contribute to the severity of the disease
observed in humans infected with HPAIV. Moreover, a recent
work by Watanabe et al. (2011) showed that a single amino-
acid change in the HA (D222G) of a H1N1 2009 pandemic
IAV, which is determinant for the receptor binding preference
modiﬁcation from SAα2,6 to mixed SAα2,3 and SAα2,6, corre-
lated with severe infection in macaques and higher replication
in human lung tissue. It is believed that modiﬁcations in the
receptor speciﬁcity of avian H5N1 inﬂuenza virus would be nec-
essary to allow human-to-human direct transmission (Enserink,
2007; Tumpey et al., 2007). However, some studies indicate that a
change from SAα2,3 to SAα2,6 binding preference is not enough
to increase transmission efﬁciency in ferrets (Maines et al., 2006;
Chen et al., 2012), which are a suitable animal model for the
study of inﬂuenza since they are susceptible to human inﬂuenza
viruses (Matsuoka et al., 2009), suggesting that several molecu-
lar changes, not only in the HA gene but also in other segments,
would be required to confer efﬁcient ﬁtness in humans and become
pandemic.

The development of glycan arrays has provided highly valu-
able information regarding the receptor binding speciﬁcity of
the HA of numerous IAV isolates (Stevens et al., 2006a,b). These
assays allow researchers to determine the SAα2,3 or SAα2,6 gly-
cans that interact with the viral HA or whole virus, by using a
broad panel of synthetic polymers. Therefore, we now know that
not only the SAα2,3 or SAα2,6 linkages, but also the underlying
sugar chain features, like other modiﬁcations such as sulfation,
fucosylations, or additional sialylation of the sialyl-receptors are
determinant for the binding speciﬁcity of the HA, being very
variable among the different IAV subtypes and isolates (Stevens
et al., 2006a), which could be determinant not only in the host
and cell tropism, but also in differential recognition by cell
receptors.

SIALYLATED GLYCANS AS RECEPTORS: INVOLVEMENT IN
THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO IAV AND PATHOGENESIS
In the last few years, numerous studies have provided increasing
evidence for a role for the viral HA–SA interaction in the induction
of innate immunity and pathogenesis. SA are structural compo-
nents of the cell surface, and they have important implications in
the immune responses (Crocker and Varki, 2001; Videira et al.,
2008). On the other hand, DCs are essential players in the induc-
tion of innate immunity, as well as in the initiation of adaptive
responses. Upon sensing invading pathogens via several pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs), they differentiate to mature DCs
and migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs, where they present
the processed antigen to T-lymphocytes. Importantly, human DCs
express SAα2,3 and SAα2,6 on their surface (Videira et al., 2008;
Ramos et al., 2011), and the levels of expression of sialyltrans-
ferases and therefore, the SA levels on the surface, are modulated
during differentiation and maturation processes (Bax et al., 2007;
Videira et al., 2008). Additionally, it has also been shown that the
elimination of the SA from the surface using a sialidase induced
the maturation and activation of human DCs (Crespo et al., 2009),
and that endogenous neuraminidase activity is necessary for the
immune response to bacterial infections (Amith et al., 2009; Stam-
atos et al., 2010). These last studies reinforce the idea of a role for
SA in immunity, and also could have implications in the immune
responses against IAV, as the IAV NA is one important component
of viral particles. One of the ﬁrst reports suggesting the importance
of HA–SA interaction in eliciting innate immune responses was
published by Miller and Anders (2003), who showed that inacti-
vated IAV are able to induce type I IFN production in mouse spleen
cells in a SA-dependent manner. Herein, it is important to mention
that the induction of type I IFN in immune cells by inactivated
viruses via TLR7 could also be dependent on HA–SA interaction,
since a more efﬁcient SA-dependent entry of inactivated viruses
would result in an enhanced recognition of viral ssRNA by TLR7
in the endosomes (Diebold et al., 2004).

Several studies have been performed comparing cytokine
responses between avian H5N1 viruses and human H1N1 in
immune and epithelial cells, and most were able to demonstrate
that the H5N1 IAV induced the strongest production of cytokines
and chemokines, as compared to H1N1 IAV (Cheung et al., 2002;
Chan et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2008, 2009; Cheng et al., 2010). How-
ever, the viral factors responsible for this effect were not clearly
determined, due to high disparity in the viral segments among the
strains compared, and it is likely that a combination of them (HA,
NS1, PB1-F2. . .) could account for these differences. In order to
elucidate if differences in receptor speciﬁcity of the IAV are impor-
tant for this hyper-induction of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, we
recently reported that recombinant viruses bearing the HA and
NA from a HPAIV H5N1, which differed only in two amino-acids
that were shown to modify receptor speciﬁcity, induced differ-
ent cytokine proﬁles in human DCs, macrophages, and primary
bronchial–epithelial cells (Ramos et al., 2011). Using these viruses
with identical genes with the exception of two amino-acids in the
HA we could clearly analyze the contribution of this important
factor to the immune responses in human immune cells. Specif-
ically, the recombinant IAV with avian-type receptor speciﬁcity
(226Q/228G) induced higher levels of type I IFN, TNF-α, IP-10,

RANTES, and IL-6 than the one with increased human-type recep-
tor speciﬁcity (226L/228S), indicating that the differential binding
of the IAV to their receptors in the cell surface could contribute
for the hyper-cytokinemia observed in HPAIV patients. These
data indicate that recognition of IAV by cell surface receptors in
immune cells could occur differently depending on their bind-
ing preference, as proposed in the model shown in Figure 1.
In this hypothetical model, IAV could be detected by separate
unknown receptors differently sialylated (either SAα2,3 or SAα2,6;
Figure 1A), or by a receptor expressing both SAα2,3 and SAα2,6
(Figure 1B). In these two cases, engagement of avian IAV to a
putative receptor containing SAα2,3 would result in activation
of signaling pathways leading to increased cytokine production
and inﬂammation. However, human IAV detection would result in
delayed induction of cytokines. At that stage of infection, IAV pro-
teins involved in innate immune evasion (such as NS1 or PB1-F2)
could antagonize innate immunity, resulting in lower expression
of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines.

On the other hand, another study by a different group found
that recombinant HA proteins from an H5N1 and a 2009 H1N1
virus were able to induce DC activation of murine DCs in a
MyD88/TLR4 dependent manner (Liu et al., 2010), indicating a
possible role for this Toll-like receptor (TLR) in recognition of
IAV HA. In this work, no clear differences were observed between
H5 and H1 HAs, but it is important to note that the cytokine proﬁle
induced in murine DCs could differ of that observed in human
DCs, probably due to different sialylation patterns in those two
systems.

Interestingly, Eierhoff et al. (2010) recently discovered that
IAV interact with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in
a SA-dependent manner. They clearly showed that IAV attach-
ment to this receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family member
promotes its activation, resulting in increased IAV uptake. Fur-
thermore, they observed recruitment of the regulatory subunit
p85 of PI3K to the EGFR in response to viral attachment, indi-
cating activation of downstream signaling pathways, which are
necessary for endocytosis triggering. These results are of great
relevance, indicating that the interaction of the viral particles
with the cell surface via RTK might have important impact not
only in viral uptake, as the authors demonstrated, but its acti-
vation could play a role also in the innate immune response to
IAV, since it is known that the EGFR pathway is involved in the
production of IL-8 by respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in neu-
trophils recruitment in airway inﬂammatory diseases (Subauste
and Proud, 2001; Nakanaga et al., 2007). Moreover, as EGFR activa-
tion was observed to be SA-dependent, further studies to elucidate
if the same signaling pathways are trigged by viruses with dif-
ferent SAα2,3 or SAα2,6 receptor speciﬁcity would be of great
interest.

Receptors for IAV and innate immunity

are nucleic acid recognizing receptors, such as RIG-I-like recep-
tors (RLRs) and TLRs (Garcia-Sastre, 2011), and more recently,
nucleotide oligomerization domain receptors or Nod-like recep-
tors (NLRs) have been shown to have also an important role in
IAV infection (Allen et al., 2009; Ichinohe et al., 2009). However,
although not much attention has been paid so far to the IAV gly-
coproteins as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
there is increasing evidence for the importance of their interaction
with the host cell and the initiation of signaling pathways related
with either internalization/endocytosis and cytokine production
(Table 1).

Several studies showed that interactions of the HA of the IAV
with C-type lectins receptors (CLRs) are important for IAV infec-
tivity and for induction of type I IFN production in immune
cells, since these are reduced upon pre-incubation with mannans
and/or blocking antibodies (Miller and Anders, 2003; Londrigan
et al., 2011; Seeds et al., 2011). CLRs are important PRRs in
the immune response to pathogens, since they mediate attach-
ment of the pathogens to DCs and macrophages. Attachment
events facilitate phagocytosis, and also induce the activation of
several signaling pathways that modulate immune responses to
that pathogen (Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009).

Dendritic cell-speciﬁc intercellular adhesion molecule-3-
grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is one of the best-characterized
CLRs, which is expressed in immature DCs and recognizes and
binds to high mannose containing glycoproteins, commonly found
in several pathogens, including viruses. H5N1 pseudotyped viruses
were demonstrated to efﬁciently infect THP-1/DC-SIGN express-
ing cells, and the infectivity was reduced using DC-SIGN blocking
antibodies (Wang et al., 2008). Another interesting observation in
this manuscript was that DC-SIGN dependent entry was observed
to be also dependent on SA. In contrast, another study focused
in the role of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN in IAV entry, using SA-
deﬁcient cells and the virus strain BJx109 (H3N2), indicated that
the entry mediated by these receptors was SA-independent (Lon-
drigan et al., 2011). These discrepancies are likely to be due to
differences on experimental designs as, for instance, the avian H5

and the H3 from BJx109 present afﬁnity for differently galactose-
linked SA (SAα2,3 and SAα2,6, respectively). SIGN-R1 is one
of the human DC-SIGN homologous proteins in mouse, and it
is expressed in some subsets of macrophages and DCs in the
spleen and the lymph node (Kang et al., 2003; Gonzalez et al.,
2010; Lyszkiewicz et al., 2011). Similarly to human DC-SIGN,
SIGN-R1 has also been reported to interact with IAV. Gonzalez
et al. (2010) observed that a SIGN-R1-speciﬁc blocking anti-
body reduces IAV PR8 binding to lymph node DCs both in vitro
and in vivo (using multiphoton intra-vital microscopy), and the
viral uptake via this receptor was essential for local humoral
immunity.

Additional C-type lectins that IAV have been shown to inter-
act with are the murine macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL)
and macrophage mannose receptor (MMR). These interactions
were observed to be SA-independent, and correlated with the
different HA glycosylation levels of a few IAV strains (Read-
ing et al., 2000; Upham et al., 2010). On the other hand, the
mannose binding lectin (MBL), which is a soluble PRR belong-
ing to the collectins family, is known to have anti-IAV activity,
since it inhibits hemagglutination, resulting in viral neutraliza-
tion, opsonizes viral particles allowing for better recognition and
ingestion by phagocytic cells, and also activates the lectin com-
plement pathway (Kawai et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2010; Gonzalez
et al., 2010).

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The IAV interaction with surface cellular receptors is important
for the pathogenesis and the immune responses generated in the
host. The receptor speciﬁcity of IAV is determinant for allowing
entry in the cell, and differential SA speciﬁcity accounts for host
and cell tropism. Several speciﬁc cell receptors have been identiﬁed
to interact with IAV in a SA-dependent or independent way. Fur-
ther studies will allow for a better understanding of the outcome
of these interactions and identiﬁcation of new receptors, which
could be important for the immune responses necessary for virus
clearance or exaggerated responses that result in acute infections

and complications in high risk populations, as well as in infec-
tion by HPAIV. Recent data from several groups, including ours,
strongly suggest that these receptors, when present in immune
cells, might account for speciﬁc pro-inﬂammatory responses or
facilitation of virus entry into cells. These ﬁndings may shed new
light into the observed exacerbated immune responses in humans
infected with viruses with different host tropism, such as HPAIV
H5N1. Further studies need to be performed to analyze if IAV
with different SA binding afﬁnity indeed bind different receptors

in antigen presenting cells or if the different binding by those HAs
induces distinct signaling cascades in those cells.
