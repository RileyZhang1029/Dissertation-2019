Soil ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are highly abundant and play an important role in
the nitrogen cycle. In addition, AOA have a signiﬁcant impact on soil quality. Nitrite pro-
duced by AOA and further oxidized to nitrate can cause nitrogen loss from soils, surface
and groundwater contamination, and water eutrophication. The AOA discovered to date
are classiﬁed in the phylum Thaumarchaeota. Only a few archaeal genomes are available
in databases. As a result, AOA genes are not well annotated, and it is difﬁcult to mine
and identify archaeal genes within metagenomic libraries. Nevertheless, 16S rRNA and
comparative analysis of ammonia monooxygenase sequences show that soils can vary
greatly in the relative abundance of AOA. In some soils, AOA can comprise more than 10%
of the total prokaryotic community. In other soils, AOA comprise less than 0.5% of the
community. Many approaches have been used to measure the abundance and diversity of
this group including DGGE, T-RFLP, q-PCR, and DNA sequencing. AOA have been studied
across different soil types and various ecosystems from the Antarctic dry valleys to the
tropical forests of South America to the soils near Mount Everest. Different studies have
identiﬁed multiple soil factors that trigger the abundance of AOA.These factors include pH,
concentration of available ammonia, organic matter content, moisture content, nitrogen
content, clay content, as well as other triggers. Land use management appears to have a
major effect on the abundance of AOA in soil, which may be the result of nitrogen fertilizer
used in agricultural soils. This review summarizes the published results on this topic and
suggests future work that will increase our understanding of how soil management and
edaphoclimatic factors inﬂuence AOA.

DISCOVERY OF THE AMMONIA-OXIDIZING ARCHAEA, THEIR
TAXONOMY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND METABOLISM
FIRST DISCOVERIES OF NOVEL GROUP
Chemolithotrophic nitriﬁcation is a two-step process. First step
includes oxidation of ammonia to nitrite conducted by ammonia-
oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and second step is conversion of nitrite
to nitrate by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB; Hastings et al., 2000;
Hermansson and Lindgren, 2001; Kowalchuk and Stephen, 2001).
Before the discovery of large numbers of ammonia-oxidizing
archaea (AOA) in the environment, aerobic ammonia-oxidizers
were thought to be restricted to AOB from β- and γ-subclasses
of the Proteobacteria. The ﬁrst published evidence that archaea
might be involved in ammonia oxidation came from the discovery
of archaeal homologs to bacterial ammonia monooxygenase gene
(amoA) in archaea-associated scaffolds from the whole genome
shotgun sequencing project of the Sargasso Sea (Venter et al.,
2004). An in silico comparison to environmental sequences from
public databases revealed that the archaeal amoA and amoB genes
from the large-insert environmental fosmid library of a calcare-
ous grassland were highly similar to archaea-associated scaffolds
from the Sargasso Sea (Treusch et al., 2005). This insert also con-
tained a 16S rRNA gene that proved that the organism from
which this amoA homolog originated was a mesophilic Crenar-
chaeota. At the same time, Könneke et al. (2005) isolated a marine
crenarchaeote (SCM1) that grows chemolithoautotrophically by

aerobically oxidizing ammonia to nitrite. Wuchter et al. (2006)
enriched a crenarchaeote from North Sea water and showed that its
abundance, but not the abundance of AOB, correlates with ammo-
nium oxidation to nitrite. The same study also found that archaeal
amoA copy numbers were higher than bacterial amoA. Since the
early work on Crenarchaeota, multiple studies have observed a
predominance of AOA over AOB in multiple environments, par-
ticularly in soil (Leininger et al., 2006; Nicol et al., 2008; Schauss
et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010).

CLASSIFICATION: THAUMARCHAEOTA OR CRENARCHAEOTA?
Initially, AOA were classiﬁed as mesophilic Crenarchaeota
(Treusch et al., 2005). Brochier-Armanet et al. (2008) proposed
that the archaeal ammonia oxidizers were sufﬁciently distinct to
be separated from the Crenarchaeota into a new phylum, Thau-
marchaeota. This distinction was based on phylogenetic analysis
of ribosomal protein encoding genes and some protein-coding
genes. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of marine and soil AOA
revealed six conserved signature indels and more than 250 pro-
teins unique only to the Thaumarchaeota (Spang et al., 2010).
Also, Pelve et al. (2011) found that the Cdv system, related to
the eukaryotic ESCRT-III machinery, is the primary cell division
system in the thaumarchaeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus and that
the FtsZ protein performs a function in archaea other than cell
division.

Drivers of AOA in soils

ECOPHYSIOLOGY
Ammonia-oxidizing archaea and AOB oxidize ammonia by using
ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) enzyme. Although nitrite is
the ﬁnal product for both archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxida-
tion, big differences exist between the AOA and AOB ammonia
oxidation processes. First, the intermediate product of bacterial
ammonia oxidation to nitrite is hydroxylamine (Kowalchuk and
Stephen, 2001). The intermediate product of archaeal ammo-
nia oxidation is not as clear, but nitroxyl has been proposed as
the intermediate (Walker et al., 2010). Second, the structure of
AMO differs between bacteria and archaea (Könneke et al., 2005;
Walker et al., 2010). Third, archaeal AMO has a higher afﬁn-
ity for substrate than does bacterial AMO (Martens-Habbena
et al., 2009; Martens-Habbena and Stahl, 2011). Fourth, while
AOB are obligate autotrophs, AOA can also use organic carbon
(Hallam et al., 2006; Walker et al., 2010; Blainey et al., 2011; Tourna
et al., 2011). Differences listed above between AOA and AOB
led to the idea of existence of different physiological approaches
in utilizing of available nutrient resources between these two
groups.

DIFFICULTIES IN STUDYING AOA: CULTIVATION, LACK OF
REFERENCE GENOMES
To date, only eight AOA species have been described from marine,
soil, sediment, and hot spring environments (Table 1). Two
of them were isolated in pure cultures, and ﬁve species can
grow in enriched cultures but were not isolated in pure cul-
tures. Only six whole genomes of AOA are available in the
databases. As the AOA have been found under a wide variety of
conditions including varied temperature, pH, ammonia concen-
trations, and oxygen supply, designing media for their cultivation

has been difﬁcult. The lack of a variety of cultured AOA and
AOA genomes has limited the study of their physiology and
metabolism.

ECOLOGICAL ROLE OF AOA AND WHY STUDY THEM?
First, AOA are likely involved in nitrate leaching from soils, which
causes surface and groundwater contamination. Nitrogen loss can
occur at many points during the nitriﬁcation process (Kowalchuk
and Stephen, 2001). The nitrate produced during nitriﬁcation
can lead to the elimination of ﬁxed nitrogen from an environ-
mental system. Nitrate leaching from soil is another important
route of nitrogen loss from ecosystems. Cationic ammonium
(NH4
) molecules are more stable in soil through binding to
anionic soil particles, but nitrate (NO3
) has more mobility in soil
and can easily leach from the soil surface to groundwater causing
contamination (Kowalchuk and Stephen, 2001).

Second, AOA activity may be a signiﬁcant source of green-
house gas emissions from the soil. Recently, it was found that
nitrous oxide (N2O) is the dominant ozone-depleting substance
emitted in the 21st century (Ravishankara et al., 2011). Nitrous
oxide is transported to the stratosphere where it destroys ozone
through a nitrogen oxide-catalyzed process. Nitrous oxide has
298 times higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide
(CO2; van Groenigen et al., 2011). Autotrophic nitriﬁcation is a
main pathway of nitrous oxide production in soil environments
(Colliver and Stephenson, 2000; Kowalchuk and Stephen, 2001;
Shaw et al., 2006). Santoro et al. (2011) suggested that AOA may
be largely responsible for the nitrous oxide production in marine
environments. As AOA outnumber AOB in soil, it is possible that
archaea may be the major source of soil nitrous oxide emission.
Jung et al. (2011) observed that production of nitrous oxide by the

Drivers of AOA in soils

soil archaeon Ca. Nitrosoarchaeum koreensis and rates of nitrous
oxide production are dependent on soil ammonia and dissolved
oxygen (DO) concentration. To date, the mechanism of nitrous
oxide production by archaea is unclear.

Possible consequences of autotrophic nitriﬁcation are contami-
nation of surface and ground water, loss of soil fertility, emission of
greenhouse gases, and chemical degradation of agricultural lands
(Oldeman et al., 1991; Kowalchuk and Stephen, 2001; Ghosh and
Dhyani, 2005; Santoro et al., 2011). AOA are frequently dominant
ammonia oxidizers in soils (Leininger et al., 2006), and, there-
fore, their activity could lead to these consequences. Studying
the abundance and composition of archaeal ammonia oxidiz-
ers and understanding how soil properties inﬂuence this group
has long-lasting implications for sustainable agriculture and it
attracts the attention of many research groups from around
the world.

EDAPHOCLIMATIC FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE AOA
ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY
Main environmental factors that shape the ecological niches of
AOA from the ocean, hot springs, soils, and sediments were
discussed in the review paper by Erguder et al. (2009). Recent
advances in ecology, genetics, physiology, and culturing hap-
pened in the ﬁeld of AOA, such as sequencing of ﬁrst genome
of non-symbiotic marine AOA (Walker et al., 2010), obtaining
pure cultures, and high enrichments of Nitrososphaera viennensis
(Tourna et al., 2011), Ca. Nitrosoarchaeum koreensis, Ca. Nitrosoar-
chaeum limina, Ca. Nitrosotalea devanaterra and sequencing of
their genome; discovery of AOA ecotypes in soils based on differ-
ent pH levels (Gubry-Rangin et al., 2011) and another evidences
of organic carbon utilization provided more information about
physiology and metabolism of this group.

AMMONIA OR AMMONIUM AS SUBSTRATE FOR AMMONIA
MONOOXYGENASE
+
Is ammonia (NH3) or the cation ammonium (NH4
) the sub-
strate for the archaeal AMO enzyme? Ammonia is known to be
the substrate of this initial step in bacterial ammonia oxidation
(Suzuki et al., 1974; Arp et al., 2002). However, despite several
studies dedicated to studying the biochemistry of AMO in bacteria,
it still remains unknown whether ammonia or ammonium is the
substrate for archaeal AMO (Martens-Habbena and Stahl, 2011).
Bacterial oxidation of ammonia to nitrite (NO2
) is a two-step
process. AMO oxidizes ammonia to hydroxylamine (NH2OH),
and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) catalyzes oxidation of
hydroxylamine to nitrite (Arp et al., 2002). Structural differences
in the archaeal AMO and bacterial AMO and the absence of
genes encoding HAO and cytochrome c proteins for recycling elec-
trons suggest important differences between bacterial and archaeal
ammonia oxidation. For example, nitroxyl (HNO) rather than
hydroxylamine may be the intermediate in the AMO enzymatic
reaction, or a different cytochrome system may be responsible for
electron channeling in AOA (Walker et al., 2010).

−

The majority of AOA discovered to date were found in olig-
otrophic conditions (Hatzenpichler et al., 2008; Walker et al.,
2010). The afﬁnity of marine archaeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus
for ammonium/ammonia was 200-fold higher than substrate

afﬁnity of AOB (Martens-Habbena et al., 2009; Martens-Habbena
and Stahl, 2011). These microorganisms can obtain energy even
under very low concentrations of substrate. It has been suggested
that the differences in substrate afﬁnities allow AOA and AOB
to inhabit distinct niches separated by substrate concentration
and thereby reduce competition (Martens-Habbena et al., 2009;
Schleper, 2010; Martens-Habbena and Stahl, 2011; Verhamme
et al., 2011). There are studies that suggest substrate inhibition
of archaeal nitriﬁcation if high concentrations of ammonia are
present (Di et al., 2010; Tourna et al., 2010).

Because AMO in AOA has a much higher afﬁnity for sub-
strate than the analogous process in AOB, it has been suggested
that AOA dominate over AOB where ammonia concentrations are
particularly low. This seems to be the case in oligotrophic envi-
ronments such as sea water or hot springs (Hatzenpichler et al.,
2008; Walker et al., 2010). For example, Ca. Nitrososphaera gar-
gensis, which was ﬁrst found in hot springs, ﬁxes bicarbonate at
lower levels when the ammonia concentration was higher than
3.1 mM. The optimal ammonia concentration for bicarbonate
ﬁxation was much lower, between 0.14 and 0.8 mM (Hatzenpich-
ler et al., 2008). Some studies suggest that substrate concentration
does not inﬂuence thaumarchaeal ammonia oxidation (Stopnisek
et al., 2010; Verhamme et al., 2011). These authors showed that
AOA grew similarly at low, medium, and high ammonia con-
centrations, whereas AOB grew best only with high ammonia
concentrations. Other factors were suggested to be important in
the growth of AOA. Di et al. (2009) observed in nitrogen-rich
grassland soils neither AOA abundance nor their activity increased
with the application of a large dose of ammonia substrate. In this
study, AOA abundance was not quantitatively related to nitriﬁca-
tion rates. Similarly, Ke and Lu (2012) did not see any changes
in AOA in paddy ﬁeld soils after urea was applied as nitrogen
fertilizer.

In some studies, high ammonia appears to promote AOA
growth and activity. Treusch et al. (2005) found considerably
higher amounts of archaeal amoA transcripts in those samples
that had been amended with additional ammonia (10 mM).
It was demonstrated that the soil archaea Nitrososphaera vien-
nensis strain EN76 grows well in media containing ammonium
concentrations as high as 15 mM, but its growth is inhibited
at 20 mM (Tourna et al., 2011). This is considerably higher
than the inhibitory concentration of 2–3 mM reported for the
aquatic AOA Nitrosopumilus maritimus (Walker et al., 2010) and
Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis (Hatzenpichler et al., 2008). Toler-
ance for ammonia toxicity of Ca. Nitrosoarchaeum koreensis strain
MY1, isolated from an acidic agricultural soil, was slightly lower,
5 mM, than that of Nitrososphaera viennensis (Jung et al., 2011).
Park et al. (2006) found archaeal amoA in wastewater with 2 mM
ammonia.

The source of substrate and its location can inﬂuence ammonia
concentration in soil (Offre et al., 2009; Stopnisek et al., 2010; Ver-
hamme et al., 2011). Ammonium production via mineralization,
additions of ammonical fertilizers, animal wastes, and the atmo-
spheric deposition of ammonium increases substrate supply, while
competing consumptive processes include microbial assimilation
(immobilization), plant assimilation, and ammonia volatiliza-
tion reduce ammonia concentration (Norton and Stark, 2011).

Drivers of AOA in soils

In addition, AOA do not respond to the addition of mineral
nitrogen to soil (Di et al., 2009; Jia and Conrad, 2009; Stopnisek
et al., 2010; Verhamme et al., 2011; Ke and Lu, 2012). In contrast,
AOB increase in abundance after addition of ammonium sulfate
or urine (Di et al., 2009, 2010; Jia and Conrad, 2009; Hofferle
et al., 2010). Archaeal amoA gene copies and nitrate concentra-
tion increased during incubation soil for 30 days (Offre et al.,
2009). All ammonia in this soil was generated by nitrogen min-
eralization since no ammonia was added. Also, it was shown
in upland ﬁeld soils archaeal 16S rRNA gene was signiﬁcantly
affected by the class of fertilizer (chemical or organic fertilizer). In
four different soil types 16S rRNA abundance of AOA was about
0.1–0.9× 108 gene copy number higher in the plots where organic
fertilizers were added than in the plots with chemical fertilizer
addition.

Nitrate concentrations likely differ greatly both spatially and
temporally under these two scenarios (Stopnisek et al., 2010).
While ammonia from organic matter mineralization is slowly and
constantly liberated resulting in low, but steady, levels of ammo-
nia, an application of mineral nitrogen fertilizer promotes a burst
of ammonia. Archaeal ammonia oxidizers should be expected to
be in a higher abundance in the soils with high organic matter,
which would provide a constant source of substrate (Stopnisek
et al., 2010).

Adaptation to different concentrations of ammonia and the
ability to survive even at extremely low concentrations of ammo-
nia, together with other ecological factors, contribute to the
ecological ﬁtness and niche adaptation of AOA and AOB. The
presence of different ecophysiological adaptations such as different
concentrations of substrate suggests that a wide range of ecotypes
can be expected to occur among soil AOA.

+

DIFFERENT LINEAGES OF AOA RESIDE AT DIFFERENT pH LEVELS
Ammonia (NH3), not ammonium (NH4
), is the likely substrate
for the AMO that catalyzes the initial step of the oxidation of
ammonia (Arp et al., 2002). The ammonia form is pH dependent
(pKa = 9.25, 25
C) and conversions between ionic and cationic
forms may occur close to or at the cell membrane (Norton and
Stark, 2011).

◦

Ammonia-oxidizing archaea are more tolerant to low pH than
AOB, and AOA are mainly responsible for nitriﬁcation in acidic
soils (Leininger et al., 2006; Gubry-Rangin et al., 2010; Yao et al.,
2011; Zhang et al., 2011; Isobe et al., 2012). Archaeal amoA was
found in conditions as low as pH 2.5 in terrestrial hot springs
(Reigstad et al., 2008), as high as pH 8.2 in North Sea water
and sediments (Wuchter et al., 2006; Blainey et al., 2011), and
at pH 9 at Eagleville spring in California (Zhang et al., 2008),
where they were the only representatives of ammonia oxidizers.
The lowest pH levels of soil in which AOA have been found are
3.6–4.0 (He et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2011). Nicol et al. (2008)
reported that archaeal amoA gene and transcript abundance
decreased with higher pH during a soil microcosm experiment.
Further study revealed an increase in archaeal amoA gene and tran-
script abundance during nitriﬁcation and inhibition of archaeal
amoA, but not bacterial amoA, by acetylene addition in two agri-
cultural acidic soils (Gubry-Rangin et al., 2010). Quantiﬁcation
of 1.1c crenarchaeal 16S rRNA gene abundance through a pH

gradient from 4.5 to 7.5 showed a greater proportion of this
group in the most acidic soils (Lehtovirta et al., 2009). Yao et al.
(2011) studied nitriﬁcation in tea orchard soils with low pH (3.6–
6.3) and found that the high level of nitriﬁcation was driven by
AOA but not AOB. In addition, AOA phylotypes found in highly
acidic soils (pH < 4) were negatively correlated with pH, and
AOA from soils with a higher pH (>4) showed a positive cor-
relation with pH (Yao et al., 2011). Zhang et al. (2011) found
archaea in ﬁve strongly acidic soils (between pH 4.2 and 4.47)
where archaeal amoA gene abundance was strongly correlated
with nitrate concentration. Recently Ca. Nitrosotalea devanaterra,
the ﬁrst obligate acidophilic ammonia oxidizer, was discovered
and cultured from an agricultural acidic soil (pH 4.5; Lehtovirta-
Morley et al., 2011). This archaeon is able to grow at extremely
low concentrations of ammonia (0.18 nM) suggesting that this
organism has evolved to tolerate the acidic conditions that make
ammonia concentrations very low. As AOB have a lower afﬁnity
for ammonia, the low availability of ammonia under acidic condi-
tions is believed to be the main reason for decreasing of ammonia
oxidation by AOB in acidic soils (de Boer and Kowalchuk, 2001).
In contrast, the high afﬁnity for ammonia allows certain eco-
types of AOA to grow under low concentrations of ammonia
(Nicol et al., 2008; Martens-Habbena et al., 2009; Gubry-Rangin
et al., 2010).

Ammonia-oxidizing archaea also appear dominant under alka-
line conditions as well as acidic conditions and are often more
abundant than AOB at higher pH (Shen et al., 2008; Zhang et al.,
2010; Bates et al., 2011). Shen et al. (2008) did not observe a sig-
niﬁcant correlation between AOA and pH in the alkaline soils
(pH 8.3–8.7), but the number of archaeal amoA genes did not
decline with increasing pH. In Cambisol soils (pH 6–6.5), AOA
were positively correlated with pH (Wessén et al., 2010).

Nitriﬁcation in alkaline soils (pH 7.5) by AOA was demon-
strated by Zhang et al. (2010). After incubation of soil with carbon
dioxide, archaeal but not bacterial DNA was detected, and the
number of archaeal amoA outnumbered bacterial amoA. Bates
et al. (2011) studied changes in bacterial and archaeal communi-
ties in 146 soils across the globe and found a positive correlation
between AOA with soil pH, especially in forests and shrub lands.
Bru et al. (2011) investigated the distribution of AOA communi-
ties over 107 sites in Burgundy, France, with pH ranging from
4.2 to 8.3 and found that in acidic soils AOA were below the
detection level and AOA abundance positively correlated with
soil pH.

Different AOA ecotypes have evolved to growth at different
pH levels. The existence of different environmental lineages was
suggested by Nicol et al. (2008) and supported by Gubry-Rangin
et al. (2011). Gubry-Rangin et al. (2011) clustered archaeal amoA
sequences from globally distributed soils that varied widely in
pH. They found that all studied phylogenetic lineages were classi-
ﬁed as acidophilic (lineage C – including Group 1.1a-associated),
acido-neutrophilic (linage A – including Group 1.1a), and alka-
linophilic (linage B – including Group 1.1b). These lineages vary
in their response to pH but overall, archaeal amoA abundance
increased with increasing pH. pH appears to be a strong fac-
tor in many studies, but AOA are successful across a range of
pH values.

Drivers of AOA in soils

CARBON
Are AOA autotrophic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic with
regard to carbon utilization? Components of
the modiﬁed
3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle of autotrophic car-
bon assimilation were identiﬁed in genomes of Cenarchaeum sym-
biosum (Hallam et al., 2006), Nitrosopumilus maritimus (Walker
et al., 2010), Ca. Nitrosotalea devanaterra (Lehtovirta-Morley
et al., 2011), and Ca. Nitrosoarchaeum limnia (Blainey et al.,
2011). Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis (Hatzenpichler et al., 2008)
and Nitrososphaera viennensis can use carbon dioxide as sole car-
bon source (Tourna et al., 2011). Zhang et al. (2010) provided
direct evidences for autotrophic activity and autotrophic growth
of Thaumarchaeota in soil. Nitriﬁcation rates in this study cor-
related with increased archaeal, but not bacterial, amoA and hcd
(key gene in 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle) genes’
abundances. Also, stable isotope probing showed incorporation
of 13C-labeled carbon dioxide into archaeal amoA during nitri-
ﬁcation but not into bacterial amoA. In addition, mRNA-SIP
supported autotrophic carbon dioxide ﬁxation by AOA using the
3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle in an agricultural
soil (Pratscher et al., 2011).

Later evidence builds the case that some AOA take up organic
carbon compounds, but others may be inhibited by organics. The
ﬁrst ﬁnding of the uptake of amino acids by planktonic archaea
was shown by Ouverney and Fuhrman (2000). Herndl et al. (2005)
and Teira et al. (2004) indicated the uptake of amino acids by
isotopic studies of microbial communities in the Atlantic Ocean
and speculated that this could be an indication of the utilization
of the dissolved organic matter as an energy source.

Recent sequencing of AOA genomes and the culturing of AOA
have supported mixotrophy by these organisms. Oxidative and
reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) genes were found in
the genome Cenarchaeum symbiosum (Hallam et al., 2006). In
addition to the genes that code for the 3-hydroxypropionate/
4-hydroxybutyrate pathway,
the Nitrosopumilus maritimus
genome contains genes encoding for the complete oxidative TCA
cycle (Walker et al., 2010) as well as transporters for amino
acids, dipeptides/oligopeptides, sulfonates/taurine, and glycerol.
Putative organic carbon consumption was suggested based on
genome sequence of Ca. Nitrosoarchaeum limnia (Blainey et al.,
2011). Increased growth of Nitrososphaera viennensis cultures by
small additions of pyruvate (Tourna et al., 2011) also supports
mixotrophic growth by AOA.

Chen et al. (2008) reported a higher abundance of AOA in the
paddy rhizosphere compared to non-rhizosphere soil, presumably
due to organic carbon of root exudates. Increased abundance of
1.1b AOA clade occurred upon the addition of root extract as
an organic amendment to the AOA enrichment culture (Xu et al.,
2012). Nevertheless, organic substrates have been shown to inhibit
AOA or be negatively correlated with AOA abundance (Könneke
et al., 2005; Wessén et al., 2010; Bates et al., 2011). Pester et al.
(2012) also revealed negative correlation of AOA species rich-
ness to the organic carbon content in four geographically and
chemically distinct soils. Although, genetic capacity to potentially
use organic carbon and some cases of small organic molecules
uptake by AOA were found by recent studies, there is still lack of
understanding how exactly AOA use organic carbon.

TEMPERATURE
Temperature is one of the most signiﬁcant factors that affect soil
organic matter decomposition, nitriﬁcation, and greenhouse gas
production in terrestrial environments (Kirschbaum, 1995; Stark
and Firestone, 1996). Although optimal temperatures for potential
nitriﬁcation are usually between 20 and 37
C, the AOA produce
nitrite at temperatures that vary from−1
◦
C in Arctic coastal waters
to 97
C in hot springs of Iceland (Reigstad et al., 2008; Kalanetra
et al., 2009).
Archaeal amoA was detected in near-freezing Arctic and Antarc-
tic waters with 4.92 × 106 and 0.18 × 106 copies, respectively
(Kalanetra et al., 2009). Christman et al. (2011) analyzed distribu-
tion of AOA during summer (T= 5.1
◦
C)
in the Coastal Arctic Ocean and found that AOA amoA levels and
nitriﬁcation rates were higher in winter.

The majority of AOA identiﬁed in soil and marine environ-
ments are non-thermophilic and are typically found at tem-
peratures from 22 to 37
C (Könneke et al., 2005; Hallam et al.,
2006; Muller et al., 2010; Blainey et al., 2011; Jung et al., 2011;
Kim et al., 2011; Lehtovirta-Morley et al., 2011; Tourna et al.,
2011). The thermophilic AOA detected in deep-sea hydrother-
mal vents and hot springs perform nitriﬁcation at temperatures
of 45–97
C (de la Torre et al., 2008; Hatzenpichler et al., 2008;
Reigstad et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011).
A moderately thermophilic (46
C) archaeon, Ca. Nitrososphaera
gargensis, discovered in microbial mats of the Siberian Garga hot
spring was the dominant ammonia oxidizer in terrestrial non-
thermophilic environments. Archaeal adaptations to function
under elevated temperatures was demonstrated when different
temperatures for fermenting cattle manure compost revealed
growth of AOB at 37
C
(Oishi et al., 2011).

The impact of different temperatures on AOA populations
was examined in ﬁeld and microcosm experiments. Tourna et al.
(2008) studied the responses of AOA and AOB during incuba-
tion of soil microcosms at temperatures in the range 10–30
C.
They determined that the most profound changes in patterns of
◦
archaeal amoA gene transcript abundance occurred at 30
C. Stres
et al. (2008) found that soil archaeal, but not bacterial, commu-
nity structure changed during incubation at higher temperatures.
A global survey of different soils showed a positive correlation
between relative archaeal abundance and annual temperatures,
and temperature became even more signiﬁcant factor for the
relative abundance of archaea from forests and shrub lands (Bates
et al., 2011).

MOISTURE
Soil moisture and temperature impacts on main processes of nitro-
gen cycle, such as organic matter mineralization, nitric and nitrous
oxide production, nitrogen ﬁxing, and particularly, nitriﬁcation
(Kirschbaum, 1995; Zheng et al., 2000; Belnap, 2001; Norton and
Stark, 2011). Soil moisture promoted changes in the archaeal com-
munity in grassland soil microcosm (Stres et al., 2008). Bates et al.
(2011) observed a negative correlation of soil moisture in tall grass
prairies with AOA abundance. Diversity of soil microbial commu-
nities along a steep precipitation gradient ranging from an arid
area with less than 100 mm annual rain to a meso-Mediterranean

Drivers of AOA in soils

forest receiving over 900 mm precipitation was studied. Of mea-
sured physicochemical factors, water content was found to have the
strongest correlation with the bacterial and archaeal community
structures in studied soils (Angel et al., 2010).

Study of nitrogen and water amendment in two temperate
forest soils revealed that the AOA community composition was
sensitive to moisture content in one of the soils and archaeal
amoA genes were more abundant at 40% than 70% water-ﬁlled
pore space suggesting reduced oxygen levels lowered AOA growth
(Szukics et al., 2012).

OXYGEN AND OTHER FACTORS
Oxygen plays an important role in nitriﬁcation as a substrate for
the AMO enzyme and as terminal electron acceptor (Arp et al.,
2002). In soil, oxygen levels are balanced by oxygen consumption
and diffusion from the surface through the air-ﬁlled pores (Sex-
stone et al., 1985). Nitriﬁcation usually declines in soil if water
levels have exceeded ﬁeld capacity for several days (Schjonning
et al., 2003) thereby decreasing oxygen content. Tolerance to low
concentrations of DO was demonstrated in activated sludge biore-
actors with low DO (<6.3 μM; Park et al., 2006). In subterranean
estuaries at low-oxygen fresh and brackish stations, AOA were
10 times more abundant than AOB (Santoro et al., 2011). Bouskill
et al. (2012) examined the distribution AOA across large-scale gra-
dients in DO as one of the important factors of AOA distribution
in marine environments. The highest abundance of the AOA amoA
gene was recorded in the oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) of the
Eastern Tropical South Paciﬁc (ETSP) and the Arabian Sea (AS).
AOA in the AS exhibited a very narrow range of preferred oxy-
gen conditions (5–2.5 μM; Pitcher et al., 2011). Stoichiometry
and kinetic of ammonium oxidation by Nitrosopumilus maritimus
showed the endogenous oxygen uptake of the cells was consis-
tently below 0.5 μM per hour, but after addition of ammonium
to the cells, oxygen uptake increased within a few minutes up to
−1 and remained high until the ammonium level declined
30 μM h
below 1 μM (Martens-Habbena and Stahl, 2011). AOA and AOB
are adapted to life in low-oxygen or periodically anoxic habitats in
paddy soils. Although ﬂooding paddy soil is predominantly anaer-
obic, large numbers of AOA were detected (8.31 × 107–2.12 × 108

copies per gram dry soil). Moreover, AOA reacted faster to the
presence of oxygen in ﬂuctuating oxic and anoxic rhizosphere
of rice plants compared to AOB (Chen et al., 2008). Enrichment
culture of Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis was grown aerobically at
DO concentrations 0.15–1.18 mM. Kinetic respirometry assays
showed that Ca. Nitrosoarchaeum koreensis strain MY1’s afﬁni-
ties for oxygen (1.08 μM) were much higher than those of AOB
(Jung et al., 2011).

Among the factors listed above there are many other factors
that were shown to have some impact on AOA community. These
include altitude (Zhang et al., 2009), soil types (Hoshino et al.,
2011; Morimoto et al., 2011), sulﬁde (Caffrey et al., 2007; Coolen
et al., 2007), phosphate (Herfort et al., 2007), and salinity (Bern-
hard et al., 2010). However, these factors either do not have a
signiﬁcant impact on archaeal ammonia oxidation or have not
been found to inﬂuence soil AOA.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The AOA are a versatile, ubiquitous, and abundant group of
microorganisms that have adapted to survive in a wide variety
of harsh environments. Moreover, their important function in
the nitrogen cycle, and their roles in nitrate leaching, green-
house gas production, and soil subsidence make the AOA a
group that deserves further studies. Knowing the main drivers
of AOA abundance and distribution in soil is of growing inter-
est around the world. There are many studies that assess marine
environmental AOA communities, but much less is known about
soil AOA. Soil features that have major inﬂuence on shaping
AOA communities include ammonia concentration, pH, organic
matter, moisture, temperature, and oxygen. AOA possess high
afﬁnities for ammonia and oxygen and can tolerate extremes
of temperature and pH. These features explain why the AOA
greatly outnumber the AOB in many soils and other environ-
ments, as they can inhabit potential niches that are not available to
the AOB.
