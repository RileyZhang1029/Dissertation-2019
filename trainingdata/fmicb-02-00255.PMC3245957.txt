Cryopreservation of microorganisms in ancient glacial ice is possible if lethal levels of
macromolecular damage are not incurred and cellular integrity is not compromised via intra-
cellular ice formation or recrystallization. Previously, a bacterium (isolate 3519-10) recovered
from a depth of 3,519 m below the surface in the Vostok ice core was shown to secrete an
ice-binding protein (IBP) that inhibits the recrystallization of ice. To explore the advantage
that IBPs confer to ice-entrapped cells, experiments were designed to examine the expres-
sion of 3519-10’s IBP gene and protein at different temperatures, assess the effect of the
IBP on bacterial viability in ice, and determine how the IBP inﬂuences the physical struc-
ture of the ice. Total RNA isolated from cultures grown between 4 and 25˚C and analyzed
by reverse transcription-PCR indicated constitutive expression of the IBP gene. Sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of 3519-10’s extracellular pro-
teins revealed a polypeptide of the predicted size of the 54-kDa IBP at all temperatures
tested. In the presence of 100 μg mL−1 of extracellular protein from 3519-10, the survival
of Escherichia coli was increased by greater than 100-fold after 5 freeze-thaw cycles. Micro-
scopic analysis of ice formed in the presence of the IBP indicated that per square millimeter
ﬁeld of view, there were ∼5 times as many crystals as in ice formed in the presence of
washed 3519-10 cells and non-IBP producing bacteria, and ∼10 times as many crystals as
in ﬁltered deionized water. Presumably, the effect that the IBP has on bacterial viability and
ice crystal structure is due to its activity as an inhibitor of ice recrystallization. A myriad of
molecular adaptations are likely to play a role in bacterial persistence under frozen condi-
tions, but the ability of 3519-10’s IBP to control ice crystal structure, and thus the liquid
vein network within the ice, may provide one explanation for its successful survival deep
within the Antarctic ice sheet for thousands of years.

INTRODUCTION
Research on the survival and distribution of microorgan-
isms beneath the planet’s ice sheets (total surface area of
∼1.5× 107 km2) has indicated that a diverse range of habitable
environments exist in the cryospheric subsurface (e.g., Skidmore,
2011). Extrapolations based on the few data which exist suggest
that the ice sheets and subsurface environments of Greenland and
Antarctica may contain a globally relevant, yet virtually ignored
pool of microorganisms (∼1029 cells) and carbon (∼15 Pg of cell
and dissolved organic carbon; Priscu et al., 2008; Lanoil et al.,
2009). Subglacial locations harboring liquid water (e.g., subglacial
lakes) have been identiﬁed as prime targets to search for viable
microbial ecosystems (Fricker et al., 2011; Lukin and Bulat, 2011;
Ross et al., 2011; Skidmore, 2011). There is also evidence that the
physicochemical characteristics and structure of polycrystalline
glacial and basal ice provide a tenable microbial habitat where cells
reside either in liquid ﬁlled veins or the liquid ﬁlms on the surface
of entrained mineral grains (Price, 2000; Mader et al., 2006; Tung

et al., 2006; Bakermans and Skidmore, 2011a). Viable bacteria and
fungi have been recovered from ancient glacial ice originating from
a number of geographical locations (Miteva, 2008); however, little
is known about the molecular adaptations which aid these species
in tolerating low water availability, osmotic stress, high hydrostatic
pressure, and prolonged survival within the ice crystal matrix.

Some cold-adapted organisms mitigate the stress associated
with freezing by producing ice-binding proteins (IBPs) which
selectively bind to the prism facet of ice, prevent water mole-
cules from joining along the a-axis, and inﬂuence ice structure.
IBPs have been documented in a variety of cold-adapted organ-
isms including plants (Smallwood et al., 1999), diatoms (Raymond
and Knight, 2003), and ﬁsh (e.g., white ﬂounder; Carpenter and
Hansen, 1992), as well as alga and moss from cyanobacterial mats
(Raymond and Fritsen, 2001). Although few bacterial IBPs have
been characterized, the phenotype has been reported in isolates
from Antarctic sea ice, ice-covered lakes, and glacial ice (Gilbert
et al., 2005; Raymond et al., 2007, 2008), as well as cold soils (Walker

A bacterial ice-binding protein

et al., 2006). Analysis of the IBPs from ﬁsh (Sicheri and Yang, 1995;
Davies et al., 2002), insects (Graether et al., 2000), and the Antarc-
tic bacterium Marinomonas primoryensis (Garnham et al., 2011)
have provided structural information to elucidate the mechanism
by which the protein binds to the ice crystal matrix. IBPs may have
thermal hysteresis activity (i.e., depression of the freezing point
without a change in the melting point; also known as antifreeze
activity) and/or recrystallization inhibition (RI) activity. An activ-
ity toward the inhibition of recrystallization would have particular
signiﬁcance to microorganisms present within an ice matrix, as
the growth of large membrane-damaging ice crystals is a process
known to reduce cell viability during freezing and thawing (Miller
and Mazur, 1976; Gage et al., 1985; Dumont et al., 2004).

Geomicrobiological investigations of the Vostok 5G ice core
have provided data on the characteristics of cells entrapped in ice
for as long as 420,000 years and limnological conditions in sur-
face waters of the largest subglacial lake in Antarctica, Subglacial
Lake Vostok (Karl et al., 1999; Priscu et al., 1999; Christner et al.,
2006). Ice core samples from the deepest portions of the glacial
ice in the 5G bore hole (from 3,450 to 3,537 m) contain parti-
cles too large to be of aeolian origin (>30 μm) and this portion
of the core is interpreted to contain entrained bedrock material
(Simoes et al., 2002). During the characterization of microbes cul-
tured from melted samples of an ice core from a depth of 3,519 m
in 5G, a bacterial isolate (3519-10; Flavobacteriaceae family) was
identiﬁed that possesses a 54-kDa IBP homologous to those found
in some cold-adapted marine bacteria, molds, and diatoms (Ray-
mond et al., 2008). The IBP was found to cause ice pitting and
had RI activity. Further, 3519-10 was shown to have the physio-
logical potential to maintain metabolic activity in an ice matrix at
temperatures as low as −33˚C (Bakermans and Skidmore, 2011b).
To investigate the phenotypic advantage that an IBP with RI
activity confers to an ice-entrapped cell population, we examined
the expression of 3519-10’s IBP as a function of growth temper-
ature and its effect on cell viability during repeated freezing and
thawing. Although the speciﬁc mechanism by which the IBP of
3519-10 interacts with ice crystal surfaces and protects the cells is
still unclear, our results show that the presence of the IBP inﬂu-
ences the ice crystal structure. The signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings for
microbial survival in polycrystalline ice is discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
BACTERIAL STRAINS AND CULTURE CONDITIONS
Isolate 3519-10 (family Flavobacteriaceae) was previously isolated
from a Vostok 5G ice core sample recovered approximately 3,519 m
below the surface (actual sampling depth of 3518.03–3518.44 m in
the 5G core; Christner et al., 2006; Raymond et al., 2008; Figure 1).
3519-10 was cultured aerobically in R2 (Difco Laboratories, Inc.)
liquid media and incubated with shaking at 4, 10, 15, and 25˚C.
Cultures were grown until the mid-logarithmic phase of growth
for the isolation of RNA and early stationary phase for extra-
cellular protein recovery. B5 was isolated from basal ice of the
Taylor Glacier, Antarctica (Skidmore et al., 2009), and based on
16S rRNA identity, is a member of the genus Paenisporosarcina
(Phylum Firmicutes). Paenisporosarcina isolate B5 was cultured
aerobically at 15˚C in liquid R2 media until the late stationary

obically in tryptic soy broth (TSB; Difco Laboratories, Inc.) at
37˚C until the mid-logarithmic phase of growth. For crystal imag-
ing, cells cultured at 15˚C were diluted in deionized water to
an approximate cell concentration of 106 colony forming units

−1.

RNA EXTRACTION, PURIFICATION, AND ANALYSIS
Aliquots (500 μL) of 3519-10 cell suspensions that were grown at
4, 10, 15, and 25˚C were removed from culture tubes, immedi-
ately preserved in 2 volumes of RNAprotect (Qiagen), and stored
at −20˚C. The preserved samples were subsequently thawed on
−1 lysozyme in 200 μL
ice and lysed by the addition of 15 mg mL
of TE buffer (10 mM Tris–Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), followed by
incubation for 10 min at 25˚C. The bulk RNA in the lysate was
puriﬁed with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and eluted into 50 μL
of RNase-free water. Genomic DNA was digested with DNase using
the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion); its removal was conﬁrmed
with PCR (Figure 2B).

FREEZE-THAW CYCLING VIABILITY ASSAY
Cultures of E. coli in the logarithmic phase of growth were har-
vested by centrifugation at 17,000× g for 10 min., the supernatant
was removed, and cells were washed twice with an equal volume
of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl,
10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4; pH 7.4). The E. coli cell sus-
−1) were amended with the extracellular
pensions (∼108 CFU mL
protein fraction from 3519-10 at ﬁnal concentrations of 1, 10,
−1. Frozen cell suspensions containing 1, 10, and
and 100 μg mL
−1 BSA were prepared identically and served as controls.
100 μg mL
Additional controls consisted of frozen cell suspensions without
amended protein and samples that remained at 25˚C for the dura-
tion of the freeze-thaw cycling experiment. Each experimental data
point represented a measurement from triplicate samples.
The cell suspensions were frozen rapidly by incubation at
−80˚C for ∼45 min., and then samples were transferred to −5˚C
for approximately 12 h. Samples were thawed rapidly in a 25˚C
water bath, an aliquot was removed from each sample for serial
dilution plating, and the samples were refrozen as described above.
This procedure was repeated up to six times. After incubation at
37˚C for 18 h, the number of E. coli colonies formed on the dilu-
tion plate series was counted to determine the number of CFU per
milliliter.

CRYSTAL STRUCTURE IMAGING
Samples of deionized water passed though a 0.2-μm pore size
ﬁlter, washed 3519-10 and Paenisporosarcina isolate B5 cells, and
the extracellular proteins harvested from 3519-10 were frozen at
−10˚C. Samples were frozen within modiﬁed 50 mL polypropy-
lene centrifuge tubes. The bottom of each tube was removed and
the tubes were attached to a 30.5-cm2 and ∼1 cm thick aluminum
plate using O.C.T. embedding compound (Tissue Tek, Sakura).
Twenty milliliters of liquid sample was placed in the tubes afﬁxed
to the plate and the tubes were capped. The samples were insulated
on the sides and top by 2
of extruded polystyrene foam board to
minimize air space around these portions of the sample to encour-
age prominent crystal growth in the vertical direction (i.e., away
from the aluminum plate). A thermistor connected to a HOBO®
data logger (Onset Corporation) was suspended in each tube 2 cm
above the aluminum plate to record the temperature of the sample
during supercooling, freezing, and equilibration with the ambient
temperature.

(cid:2)(cid:2)

Approximately 20 h after freezing, thin sections (∼1 mm) from
ice in the lowest 5 mm of the ice column were prepared and imaged
at −10˚C under cross-polarized light using an Olympus BX51-
TRF epiﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a Linkam large
area thermal stage. Eight to 15 images were collected via transect
from the outside edge of the sample to the center of the sample
(Figure 3A) depending on the amount of overlap between the
images. The number of crystals per image was counted to calcu-
late the average number of ice crystals per square millimeter. The
ﬁeld of view was calibrated using a 1-mm SPI PS8 micrometer.

4˚C grown culture of 3519-10, 4–6 from 10˚C, 7–9 from 15˚C, and 10–12 from
25˚C cultures. (B). Identical samples lacking a RT step. Lane assignments

(Amicon), both of which have reported nominal molecular
weight cutoffs of 30 kDa. Cultures of 3519-10 were centrifuged
at 17,000× g for 10 min to pellet the cells, and either 1.5 or
12 mL of the supernatant was ﬁltered through the YP-30 or Ultra
15, respectively. After centrifugation at 13,500× g for 12 min or
4,500× g for 20 min. (YP-30 or Ultra 15, respectively), the ﬁl-
ters were washed in deionized H2O. The concentrated protein was
recovered by inverting and centrifuging at 1,000× g for 3 min (YP-
30) or by using a pipette (Ultra 15) and was stored at 4˚C until
use. Samples containing deionized water were prepared in parallel
to serve as controls.

The protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie
(Bradford) Protein Assay kit (Pierce) and bovine serum albu-
min (BSA) as a standard. Absorbance at 595 nm was measured
with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. The extracellu-
lar proteins of 3519-10 were separated using sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gel
was buffered with tris–glycine (25 mM Tris Base, 250 mM glycine,
0.1% SDS, pH 8.3) and consisted of a 5% stacking and 12% run-
ning gel (w/v of polyacrylamide). SDS-PAGE was conducted at
70 V for 30 min and increased to 100 V for ∼3 h. The separated
polypeptides were visualized by staining with Coomassie stain
(Weber and Osborn, 1969). The size of polypeptides was estimated
by comparison to the electrophoretic migration distance of a 10-
to 250-kDa molecular weight standard (New England Biolabs).

(Figure 2A), implying that the IBP gene is constitutively expressed
during logarithmic growth. Expression of the major bacterial cold
shock protein gene (cspA) and 16S rRNA were also detected under
all conditions tested (Figure 2A). Amplicons were not produced
in identical samples that omitted the RT step (Figure 2B), indicat-
ing that genomic DNA contamination was undetectable via PCR
in the puriﬁed RNA samples. To assess if the IBP gene transcripts
were translated and secreted from the cell under these conditions,
preparations of the extracellular protein fraction from cultures
incubated at intervals between 4 and 25˚C were analyzed by SDS-
PAGE (Figure 4). At all temperatures examined, there were at least
25 discernable polypeptide bands that ranged in molecular weight
between 15 and 150 kDa. Denatured polypeptides smaller in size
than the 30-kDa nominal molecular weight cutoff of the ﬁltra-
tion devices are likely to represent components of multi-subunit
proteins and/or hydrolyzed peptide fragments. A polypeptide that
corresponded to the size of the 54-kDa IBP (Raymond et al., 2008)
was observed at all growth temperatures examined (Figure 4).

BACTERIAL VIABILITY DURING FREEZING AND THAWING
To examine the effect of the IBP on bacterial viability during
the phase transition occuring between frozen incubation at −5˚C
and thawing, extracellular proteins harvested from 3519-10 were
added to populations of E. coli at concentrations of 1, 10, and
−1, and the suspensions were frozen. After 4 freeze-thaw
100 μg mL
cycles, a biphasic trend was observed in the reduction of viability
for all treatments (Figure 5). The ﬁrst two cycles resulted in a 4–5
log reduction in the number of culturable E. coli cells, whereas
only a reduction of 1–2 log was observed during cycles 2–4. How-
−1
ever, the survival of E. coli in samples containing 100 μg mL
of extracellular protein from 3519-10 cultured at 4˚C was sig-
niﬁcantly increased over that of the frozen control (cycles 1–4;
p < 0.03; Figure 5) and had 34 and >100-fold higher recovery
than frozen controls after 2 and 5 cycles, respectively. In com-
parison, proteins harvested from 3519-10 cultured at 25˚C only

amended with 100 μg mL
contained viable population sizes of E. coli that were detectable
after dilution plating and incubation.

ICE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE IMAGING
Temperature data from the probe suspended in each sample dur-
ing freezing indicated that the samples supercooled and froze
within ∼45 min., but remained at the melting point for the subse-
quent ∼2 h and were equilibrated with the ambient temperature
(−10˚C) by 3 h. Microtome-prepared thin sections of the ice were
imaged approximately 20 h after freezing (Figure 3A.). Repre-
sentative ﬁelds of view from the ﬁltered deionized water sample
(Figure 3B) and 3519-10 extracellular protein sample (Figure 3C)
demonstrated an obvious difference in bulk ice structure. Ice
samples frozen in the presence of a non-IBP producing bacteria
(Paenisporosarcina isolate B5) and washed suspensions of 3519-10
contained 4.1 and 2.7-fold, respectively, more crystals per square
millimeter than the ice formed from the ﬁltered deionized water
(Figure 6). Ice samples frozen in the presence of extracellular pro-
teins from 3519-10 had 13-fold more crystals per square millimeter
than ﬁltered deionized water (Figure 6). The number of ice crys-
tals in samples frozen in the presence of bacteria (p < 0.00001)
and the extracellular proteins from 3519-10 (p < 0.00001) were
statistically different from the control.

DISCUSSION
MICROBIAL SURVIVAL IN THE DEEP ICY BIOSPHERE
The upper 3,309 m of the Vostok 5G ice core provides one of the
oldest paleoclimatic ice core records examined to date (Petit et al.,
1999), whereas the deepest portion of the ice core (below 3,539 m)

is accreted lake water from Subglacial Lake Vostok. The latter repre-
sents the only material available to date for assessing limnological
conditions in a subglacial Antarctic lake (Karl et al., 1999; Priscu
et al., 1999; Christner et al., 2006). Although the surface tempera-
ture at Vostok is commonly below −55˚C, the temperature of the
ice at a depth of 3,519 m is approximately −8˚C (Salamatin et al.,
2004), and the base of the ice sheet is close to or at the pressure
melting point (−2.5˚C; Wüest and Carmack, 2000; Siegert et al.,
2003). Analysis of ice core depths between 3,450 and 3,539 m have
reported signiﬁcant ice crystal deformation, evidence for basal
shearing, and large particles >30 μm; characteristics which are
evidence that ice in this portion of the core has interacted with
the bed (Simoes et al., 2002). The large irregular crystals observed
at 3,519 m (Figure 1) are consistent with these prior observations
and are indicative of ice that has experienced signiﬁcant shear
and deformation, both of which are factors known to increase the
rate of recrystallization (Paterson, 1994). Since recrystallization is
damaging to biological cells and tissues (e.g., Miller and Mazur,
1976), we hypothesized that microorganisms surviving within the
basal ice horizon have adaptations to mitigate cellular damage
and/or inﬂuence the structure of the ice matrix they inhabit.

Basal ice in ice sheets and glaciers form when liquid water and
debris at the ice-bed interface becomes entrained via freeze-on or
regelation processes (Knight, 1997). Therefore, studies of basal ice
can provide information on the physical, chemical, and micro-
biological characteristics of the subglacial environment. In some
locations in East Antarctica, it has been reported that the freezing
of subglacial water has formed a 1.1-km layer of basal ice, repre-
senting about half of the total ice sheet thickness in this region
(Bell et al., 2011). Thus, the basal ice of glaciers and ice sheets
likely represents an important transient phase for microorganisms
in the subglacial environment (e.g., transport via freeze-on at the

glacier bed) and may be a valuable source of microbial inocula and
nutrients in downstream regions where basal melting and liquid
water is widespread (Skidmore, 2011). Here we report an analysis
of a bacterium isolated from basal ice from deep within the East
Antarctic Ice Sheet that produces extracellular proteins, including
a known IBP, that is capable of inhibiting recrystallization, con-
serving the ice crystal structure, and increasing the viability of
bacteria entrapped within the ice matrix.

EXPRESSION OF THE IBP AND INCREASED TOLERANCE TO FREEZING
AND THAWING
Ice-binding proteins have only been documented in cold toler-
ant organisms, and in bacteria, the phenotype has been observed
in isolates from sea ice (Raymond and Knight, 2003; Raymond
et al., 2007), glacial ice (Raymond et al., 2008), polar lakes (Ray-
mond and Fritsen, 2000, 2001), and cold soils (Walker et al., 2006).
Increased tolerance to freezing and thawing occurs when recrys-
tallization is prevented. IBPs from a sea ice diatom (Navicula) have
been shown to protect other diatoms (Raymond and Knight, 2003)
and human red blood cells (Kang and Raymond, 2004) during
freeze-thaw. Similarly, Walker et al. (2006) demonstrated that soil
isolate “Chryseobacterium sp. strain C14” produced an ice-active
substance that increased the survival of an Enterococcus sp. dur-
ing freeze-thaw cycling. Consistent with prior observations, the
presence of 3519-10’s IBP increased cell viability during repeated
freezing and thawing (Figure 5). Since our experiments were not
conducted with puriﬁed preparations of 3519-10’s IBP, it is not
possible to determine the absolute concentration effect of the IBP
on bacterial survival or ice crystal structure, nor are we able to dis-
count the affect, positive or negative, that other proteins present
may have had. However, in light of results from controls using BSA,
our results are consistent with the activities reported for puriﬁed
preparations of 3519-10’s IBP (Raymond et al., 2008). Based on the
total number of extracellular polypeptides observed by SDS-PAGE
(∼25; Figure 4) and assuming equal weight distribution for each
of the polypeptides, a crude estimate for the IBP concentration
−1 (i.e.,
that signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced bacterial viability is ∼4 μg mL
−1). A concentration of
100 μg mL
−1 has been shown to inhibit ice recrystalliza-
0.01–1.4 μg IBP mL
tion by microbial IBPs from Antarctic cyanobacterial mats, moss,
and algae (Raymond and Fritsen, 2001), suggesting that 3519-10’s
IBP has a comparable RI activity. The IBP of 3519-10 is a sol-
uble protein that is secreted by the cell and appears capable of
protecting any cell in the ice matrix (e.g., E. coli). In the habitat
of polycrystalline ice, species like 3519-10 might passively protect
freeze-sensitive cells or form consortial relationships with such
species, providing protection from ice crystal damage in exchange
for substrates or other resources.

−1/25 polypeptides= 4 μg mL

Much of what is known about the regulation of IBP expression
is restricted to studies of polar ﬁsh that seasonally experience tem-
peratures below 0˚C and induce their IBPs accordingly (Fletcher
et al., 2001). In Newfoundland winter ﬂounder, IBP mRNA is
detectable in the liver at temperatures below 8˚C, and the IBP
accumulates to detectable levels in the blood plasma after several
weeks under these conditions (Fletcher et al., 2001). In contrast,
adult cod only express their IBPs at temperatures ≤1˚C (Fletcher
et al., 1987), while the Newfoundland ocean pout produces IBP

continually independent of temperature (Fletcher et al., 1985).
Based on quantitative PCR analysis, the multiple IBP isoforms of
the diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus are differentially expressed in
response to osmotic shock and low temperature (−4˚C; Bayer-
Giraldi et al., 2010). Polypeptides and mRNA corresponding to
3519-10’s IBP were detected at all the growth temperatures tested
(up to 25˚C), indicating that low temperature was not required for
active expression. Considering the energetic cost of protein syn-
thesis and export, this apparent lack of regulation may hint at the
importance of the IBP for ensuring survival of this bacterium in its
environment. Based on the data in Figure 5, extracellular proteins
containing the IBP produced by 3519-10 at 25˚C did not protect
E. coli viability to the same degree as those produced by cultures
of 3519-10 grown at 4˚C. Although the bulk protein concentration
was identical between the treatments, there may have been fewer
IBP molecules in the extracellular protein fraction of 25˚C cultures
compared to that in the 4˚C cultures. Alternatively, the IBP may
have a decreased activity and/or stability at warmer temperatures,
providing a working hypothesis for future structural studies of this
protein.

EFFECT OF IBPS AND CELLS ON THE ICE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE
During the phase transition to ice, particles the size of bacterial
cells are rejected together with other soluble impurities into the
solute-rich environment that exists at the grain boundaries (Mader
et al., 2006). Under laboratory conditions, 3519-10 has been shown
to be metabolically active in ice to temperatures as low as −33˚C
(Bakermans and Skidmore, 2011b). Price (2007) estimated that
the concentration of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon in
the aqueous fraction of the ice in deep portions of the Vostok core
are sufﬁcient to maintain the ambient concentration of cells in the
ice for at least several hundred thousand years. In this study, the
presence of 3519-10’s IBP and ∼106 bacterial cells per milliliter
were found to affect the ice structure (Figures 6 and 3C). Since
the 3519-10 cells were washed thoroughly to remove the secreted
IBP and the Paenisporosarcina isolate B5 does not produce ice-
active substances, the implication is that particles the size and
composition of bacterial cells inﬂuence the ice structure. Though
the mechanism by which this occurs is not decipherable with the
data available, it may be due to the bacteria serving as nucleation
sites. These results are interesting considering that similar con-
−1
centrations of cells, up to ∼108 mL
are inferred to be viable, have been reported in basal ices (3,042–
3,052 m) from the GISP2 Greenland ice core (Miteva et al., 2009).
This suggests that the presence of microbial cells and their ice-
interacting substances may inﬂuence the ice crystal structure of
basal ices. In particular, recrystallization of ice grains via physical
processes has been shown to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence local strain
rate (Paterson, 1994; Samyn et al., 2008). The magnitude by which
microbes and their activities in a localized region of an ice mass,
e.g., in the basal ice layer, could impact ice rheology is unknown
and requires further investigation.

An IBP is a molecular adaptation that would be expected to
enhance the survival and persistence of species in a diverse array
of icy environments in the biosphere. Findings from the current

A bacterial ice-binding protein

study demonstrate that IBPs with RI activity can offer a distinct
survival advantage to cell populations immured in the polycrys-
talline habitat of ice. IBPs are not possessed by all microorganisms
inhabiting frozen environments and microorganisms like 3519-10
may use this phenotype as a basis for mutualistic interactions, sim-
ilar to those mediated by diffusible compounds in other bacteria
(e.g., Sher et al., 2011). A number of bacteria, including 3519-10,
have demonstrated the ability to be metabolically active within
the matrix of ice crystals (e.g., Amato et al., 2010; Bakermans
and Skidmore, 2011b). Although expression of 3519-10’s IBP was
documented at low temperature (4˚C) under liquid conditions,
determining if active expression of the IBP occurs in ice is territory
for further study.

Proteins that affect ice crystal structure and inhibit recrys-
tallization can be exploited to improve the texture of ice cream
(Regand and Goff, 2006), cold tolerance in plants (Wen-li et al.,
2005), and the cryopreservation of mammalian tissues (Bagis et al.,
2006). Currently, protein structural data for bacterial IBPs are
restricted to a single genetic form (Garnham et al., 2011). Unveiling
the structure of 3519-10’s IBP would provide important com-
parative data to aid in elucidating the molecular characteristics
unique to IBPs and may reveal novel properties relevant to appli-
cations in the industrial and biomedical sciences (e.g., improved
cryopreservation of cell lines and tissues).

In summary, expression of 3519-10’s IBP was independent of
growth temperature, affected the structure of ice crystals formed
in its presence, and protected bacteria under conditions favorable
to the process of recrystallization. Although the full range of mol-
ecular adaptations which play a role in bacterial persistence under
frozen conditions has yet to be constrained, the ability to control
ice crystal structure and preserve cellular integrity provides one
possible explanation for how 3519-10 has successfully survived in
deep Antarctic ice for thousands of years.
