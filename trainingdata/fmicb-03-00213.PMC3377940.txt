Marine Synechococcus is a globally signiﬁcant genus of cyanobacteria that is comprised
of multiple genetic lineages or clades. These clades are thought to represent ecologically
distinct units, or ecotypes. Because multiple clades often co-occur together in the oceans,
Synechococcus are ideal microbes to explore how closely related bacterial taxa within
the same functional guild of organisms co-exist and partition marine habitats. Here we
sequenced multiple gene loci from cultured strains to conﬁrm the congruency of clade clas-
siﬁcations between the 16S–23S rDNA internally transcribed spacer (ITS), 16S rDNA, narB,
ntcA, and rpoC1 loci commonly used in Synechococcus diversity studies. We designed
quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays that target the ITS for 10 Synechococcus clades, includ-
ing four clades, XV, XVI, CRD1, and CRD2, not covered by previous assays employing
other loci. Our new qPCR assays are very sensitive and speciﬁc, detecting down to tens
of cells per ml. Application of these qPCR assays to ﬁeld samples from the northwest
Atlantic showed clear shifts in Synechococcus community composition across a coastal
to open-ocean transect. Consistent with previous studies, clades I and IV dominated cold,
coastal Synechococcus communities. Clades II and X were abundant at the two warmer,
off-shore stations, and at all stations multiple Synechococcus clades co-occurred. qPCR
assays developed here provide valuable tools to further explore the dynamics of microbial
community structure and the mechanisms of co-existence.

INTRODUCTION
Marine Synechococcus is an abundant and environmentally signif-
icant group of unicellular cyanobacteria that provides an ideal
system to explore the ecology and evolution of closely related
bacterial taxa and their niche partitioning of the global oceans
(Scanlan and West, 2002). These small cyanobacteria (0.6–1.7 μm)
belong to the functional class of picophytoplankton, the smallest
(<2 μm) guild of photoautotrophs and contribute signiﬁcantly to
primary production (Waterbury et al., 1986; Li, 1994; Liu et al.,
1997; Partensky et al., 1999; Jardillier et al., 2010). Molecular
phylogeny has revealed a large genetic diversity amongst Syne-
chococcus found in marine and estuarine waters. Based on 16S
rDNA phylogeny, these strains have been classiﬁed into three major
groups, labeled subclusters 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 (Herdman et al., 2001;
Dufresne et al., 2008; Scanlan et al., 2009). Phylogenies based on
several additional loci reveal that these subclusters contain more
than 20 distinct genetic clades. Genes used to study the diversity of
marine Synechococcus include the 16S–23S internally transcribed
spacer (ITS; Rocap et al., 2002; Ahlgren and Rocap, 2006; Chen
et al., 2006; Choi and Noh, 2009; Cai et al., 2010; Huang et al.,
2012), narB (nitrate reductase; Jenkins et al., 2006; Paerl et al.,
2008, 2011), ntcA (a nitrogen regulatory gene; Penno et al., 2006;

Post et al., 2011), rpoC1 (subunit of RNA polymerase; Palenik,
1994; Toledo and Palenik, 1997; Ferris and Palenik, 1998; Muhling
et al., 2005), rbcL (Rubisco large subunit; Chen et al., 2006; Paerl
et al., 2012), psbA (photosystem I gene; Zeidner et al., 2003), cpeB
(phycoerythrin gene; Steglich et al., 2003), and petB (encoding the
cytochrome b6 subunit of the cytochrome b6f complex; Mazard
et al., 2012).

These distinct clades are thought to represent physiologically
and ecologically distinct lineages, or ecotypes, as has been seen in
Prochlorococcus, the sister genus to marine Synechococcus. Geneti-
cally distinct clades of Prochlorococcus contain strains with ecolog-
ically relevant differences in light adaptation and nutrient utiliza-
tion (Moore et al., 1998, 2002; Moore and Chisholm, 1999; Rocap
et al., 2002), and these clades occupy distinct oceanic habitats that
reﬂect their speciﬁc adaptations (West and Scanlan, 1999; Ahlgren
et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2006). Several Synechococcus clades sim-
ilarly possess distinguishing physiologies that potentially impact
their ecology (Figure 1). For example clade III strains possess a
unique form of motility that is absent in most other clades and may
allow them to ﬁnd and scavenge nutrients in oligotrophic waters
(Waterbury et al., 1985; Toledo et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2004).
Other clades differ in their accessory light harvesting pigments

of ≥55% are denoted with circles (closed circles indicate >75% support and
open circles indicate 55–75% support). Polytomies indicate cases where the
placement of clades is uncertain because of low bootstrap support or the
absence of sequences available for multiple loci. Marine Synechococcus are
classiﬁed into three subclusters 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 (black vertical boxes on left),
and phylogeny based on 1,129 core genes from 11 strains with sequenced
genomes supports the division of strains in subcluster 5.1 into two groups
5.1A (blue bar) and 5.1B (solid red bar) (Dufresne et al., 2008). The four loci
concatenated phylogeny in Figure A6 in Appendix also supports the grouping
of 5.1A strains, including clade XV. Strains in clades VII, CRD1, and XVI cluster
with 5.1B strains in clades V and VI with high bootstrap support, however it is
still unknown if these additional new strains without sequenced genomes
form a single monophyletic cluster with all 5.1B strains (dashed red line).
Information about speciﬁc physiologies, ecology, or biogeography of clades is
summarized with relevant references. Chromatic adaptation (CA) is the ability
to shift the ratio of accessory pigments phycourobilin (PUB) and
phycoerythrobilin (PEB) according to the spectral quality of light (Palenik,
2001; Six et al., 2007). Circles (or ovals, see footnotes) indicate clades for
which quantitative molecular assays have been designed to measure their

abundance in the environment. [ITS, this study; rpoC1 (Tai and Palenik, 2009;
Tai et al., 2011); 16S rDNA (Fuller et al., 2003); narB (Paerl et al., 2011)]. narB
sequences have been classiﬁed to groups “A” to “G” rather than the
convention of clades used by other loci (Paerl et al., 2011; see Figure A3 in
Appendix). Circles with letters indicate the clade(s) for which narB qPCR
primers designed for that narB group have perfect matches to at least one of
the sequences in the clade (see Figure A3 in Appendix for more info on
primer coverage). aWH8101 was formerly classiﬁed as belonging to cluster 5.2
(Herdman et al., 2001), but this and other phylogenies suggest it belongs in
cluster 5.1. bClade II includes clade WPC2 following the convention of Huang
et al. (2012). cClade XIII is congruent with and has been subsumed into clade
VII (see Figure A4 in Appendix). dITS qPCR primers were designed to
perfectly match clade X strains, now classiﬁed as clade 5.3-I. These primers
have perfect matches to sequences from 5.3-I through 5.3-III (but not 5.3-IV
through 5.3-VI; see Figure A2 in Appendix). Similarly, the clade X 16S rDNA
probe was designed before the discovery of clades 5.3-II–5.3-VI. Because
there are no corresponding 16S rDNA sequences for clades 5.3-II–5.3-VI, it is
unknown if the clade X probe detects these other subcluster 5.3 clades as
indicated by the dashed oval. eThis 16S rDNA probe detects clades V, VI, VII
together.

(Waterbury et al., 1986; Rocap et al., 2002; Six et al., 2007; Choi
and Noh, 2009) or the ability to change their light harvesting appa-
ratus in response to the spectral quality of light they experience
(chromatic adaptation; Palenik, 2001; Ahlgren and Rocap, 2006;
Six et al., 2007). While Synechococcus clades are hypothesized to
represent ecotypes, physiological characterization of isolates from
many clades unfortunately still remains sparse, making it difﬁcult
to predict what distinct niches they may occupy (Figure 1).

Quantitative molecular assays measuring the abundance of spe-
ciﬁc Synechococcus clades have been used to characterize their
biogeography and conﬁrm that these clades occupy different
niches and thus represent ecotypes. Assays include a suite of eight
oligonucleotide probes that target 10 16S rDNA clades (clades I–
X), three of which are detected together by a single probe (V, VI,
and VII; Fuller et al., 2003); quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays that
target four clades (I–IV) using the rpoC1 gene (Tai and Palenik,
2009); and qPCR assays that target seven groups of narB sequences
that each contain one or more clades (Paerl et al., 2011; Figure 1).
The use of coding genes for quantitative assays can be problem-
atic because the third codon position often necessitates the use of
degenerate primers, as is the case for the rpoC1 and narB assays.
Furthermore, strains in some clades lack the narB gene and can-
not utilize nitrate, such as RR9917 in clade IX (Scanlan et al.,
2009) and MITS9220 in clade CRD1 (Moore et al., 2002). More
recently, deep pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA has been used to
track clade abundances over time in the Red Sea (Post et al., 2011),
non-degenerate petB primers have been developed for construc-
tion of Synechococcus speciﬁc clone libraries (Mazard et al., 2012),
and DNA probes attached to ﬂuorescent beads have been used to
follow the abundances of subpopulations within clades I–IV (Tai
et al., 2011). While each of the above methods targets a differ-
ent locus, they reveal some cohesive patterns in the distribution
of some of the major clades in the oceans. Clades I and IV are
most abundant in colder, nutrient rich coastal waters while clade
II and the combined group of clades V/VI/VII are widely distrib-
uted in tropical and sub-tropical waters (Zwirglmaier et al., 2007,
2008; Figure 1). Clade III is most prevalent in warm, oligotrophic
waters, and appears to be specialized to these habitats (Fuller et al.,

2003; Zwirglmaier et al., 2007, 2008; Mella-Flores et al., 2011; Post
et al., 2011). Clade VIII may be speciﬁcally adapted to hypersaline
waters (Dufresne et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2012) while other clades
such as IX and X have been rarely seen and only at low abundance
(Zwirglmaier et al., 2007, 2008).

The growing number of Synechococcus diversity studies and
molecular assays to study their biogeography are valuable in
describing the ecology of putative Synechococcus ecotypes, but the
use of several different loci has made classiﬁcation confusing and
comparison of results from the different assays difﬁcult. The vari-
ous loci differ in their relative level of divergence, thus some clades
may be deﬁned too broadly or too narrowly. For example, the
highly conserved 16S rDNA is less divergent than other loci and
does not allow the development of speciﬁc oligonucleotides that
can resolve clades V, VI, and VII unlike the ITS and other coding
genes (Fuller et al., 2003; Ahlgren and Rocap, 2006; Huang et al.,
2012). The use of different loci also makes it difﬁcult to determine
if clades deﬁned by independent loci correspond to one another.
This is especially the case for clades that contain only sequences
obtained from environmental clone libraries (e.g., see Saito et al.,
2005; Penno et al., 2006). Sequencing multiple loci in cultured
isolates is necessary to verify potential overlap of clades identi-
ﬁed by different loci. Recently, Mazard et al. (2012) conducted
a classical multiple-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) study that
established congruence among clades by using core genes includ-
ing the rpoC1 and petB genes. They also examined the 16S rDNA
and ITS, although these genes could not be included in MLSA
as most Synechococcus genomes contain two identical copies of
the 16S rDNA and ITS. Their analysis however did not include the
commonly used ntcA or narB sequences (Ahlgren and Rocap, 2006;
Jenkins et al., 2006; Penno et al., 2006; Paerl et al., 2008; Post et al.,
2011), and the portion of the rpoC1 gene they sequenced did not
overlap with the portion used in the large dataset of available rpoC1
sequences (Toledo and Palenik, 1997; Ferris and Palenik, 1998).

In order to further the consensus in the classiﬁcation of Syne-
chococcus clades, we sequenced ﬁve loci commonly used in ﬁeld
studies, 16S rDNA, ITS, narB, ntcA, and rpoC1, in cultured isolates
distributed across 14 clades and compared the phylogenies of

the different loci. After conﬁrming that strains formed congru-
ent clades across the loci examined, we developed an expanded
set of qPCR assays that target ITS sequences for 10 genetic clades
of marine Synechococcus, including newly described clades not
detected by previous assays. The ITS was chosen because it is diver-
gent enough to allow clear resolution of clades but still contains
conserved regions for design of non-degenerate primers. Further-
more, because the ITS has been widely used it is the locus with the
largest number of sequences available for primer design. These
qPCR assays represent the most comprehensive set of quantitative
assays for this genus and provide a valuable tool to further char-
acterize the ecology of Synechococcus clades. Application of qPCR
assays to a transect in the North Atlantic off of the eastern United
States shows co-existence of multiple clades and large shifts in
Synechococcus community composition between open-ocean and
coastal environments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
ISOLATION OF SYNECHOCOCCUS STRAINS AND ENVIRONMENTAL
SEQUENCES
Three new Synechococcus isolates were obtained following the pro-
cedures outlined in (Ahlgren and Rocap, 2006). UW1 was isolated
(cid:3)
from surface waters of Hood Canal (47˚ 36.4
W)
within Puget Sound (Washington state) on March 27, 2002. Strains
UW179 and UW180 were isolated from the Equatorial Paciﬁc
south of Hawaii (12˚ 42.7
W) from 125 m on Febru-
ary 2, 2004. A single colony was picked for each strain from pour
plates made from cells grown in enrichment cultures. The ITS
sequence CHA22 was obtained from a clone library constructed
(cid:3)
from surface water sampled off of San Juan Channel (48˚ 32.5
N, 122˚ 59.4
W) off of San Juan Island, Washington on April 30,
2004. The clone library was constructed following the methods
outlined in Ahlgren and Rocap (2006).

SEQUENCING OF ISOLATES
Between 1 and 5 ml of exponential phase culture was centrifuged
at 18,000× g for 10 min and the DNA was extracted from the
cell pellet using either a DNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA) or by quick heat lysis extraction: 95˚C for 10 min in
50–100 μl of 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0. PCR primers and
reaction conditions used to amplify genes are listed in Table A1
in Appendix. PCR reaction volumes were 20 or 25 μl and con-
tained 0.2 mM each dNTPs and 1–2 μl of template DNA. All
PCR reactions started with an initial step of 95˚C for 5–10 to
denature the template DNA or activate the polymerase, and all
reactions ended with a 6- to 10-min extension step at 72˚C.
16S rDNA and 16S–23S rDNA ITS sequences were obtained by
sequencing puriﬁed PCR products obtained with Taq polymerase
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Quadruplicate 20 μl reactions
were pooled and puriﬁed using a Qiaquick PCR Puriﬁcation
Kit (Qiagen) before sequencing reactions with DYEnamic ET
dye terminator kit (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ,
USA) and sequencing on a MegaBACE 1000 automated sequencer
(Amersham Biosciences). For narB, ntcA, and rpoC1, PCR prod-
ucts were generated using Accuzyme (high ﬁdelity polymerase
PCR mix (Bioline USA Inc., Taunton, MA, USA). Products were
gel puriﬁed (Qiagen gel extraction kit), cloned into sequencing

vectors (TOPO TA Kit, Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA), and
sequenced with M13 vector primers. Raw sequences were aligned
and visually inspected using Sequencher (Gene Codes Inc., Ann
Arbor, MI, USA). Sequences have been deposited in GenBank
under the following accession numbers: 16S rDNA, JQ421027–
JQ421036; ITS, JQ421037–JQ421042, narB, JQ421043–JQ421045,
ntcA, JQ421046–JQ421052; rpoC1, JQ421053–JQ421055. Addi-
tional details are listed in Table A2 in Appendix.

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using sequences obtained in
this study, from previous studies and complete genome sequences
(Dufresne et al., 2008). ITS sequences from previous studies (Beja
et al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 2001; Ahlgren and Rocap, 2006; Chen
et al., 2006; Choi and Noh, 2009; Cai et al., 2010; Choi et al., 2011;
Mella-Flores et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012; Mazard et al., 2012)
were aligned to our existing database of sequences using automatic
alignment (PT_server alignment tool) in ARB (Ludwig et al., 2004)
and manual adjustment. For phylogenetic analyses, the two tRNAs
in the ITS and the loop portions of stem-loop structures (predicted
by MFOLD; Zuker, 2003) were excluded from alignments. Other
16S rDNA, narB, ntcA, and rpoC1 sequences were taken from pre-
vious studies (Giovannoni et al., 1990; Beja et al., 2000; Suzuki
et al., 2001; Fuller et al., 2003; Muhling et al., 2005; Everroad et al.,
2006; Jenkins et al., 2006; Penno et al., 2006; Dufresne et al., 2008;
Kan et al., 2008; Choi and Noh, 2009; Mella-Flores et al., 2011;
Mazard et al., 2012) These sequences were aligned either in ARB
(16S rDNA) or using clustal (narB, ntcA, and rpoC1) with amino
acid sequences.

∗
Trees were constructed in PAUP

(Swofford, 1999) or RAxML
(Stamatakis, 2006). The concatenated gene tree employed four loci,
the 16S rDNA gene, the ITS, ntcA, and rpoC1. For the 16S rDNA,
narB, ntcA, rpoC1 genes and the four concatenated loci, trees were
constructed using minimum evolution as the criterion and the
HKY85 model in PAUP
with gamma distributed rates of substitu-
tion and a proportion of invariable sites (HKY+ i+ g) estimated
by maximum likelihood. Trees found with the HKY+ i+ g model
were very similar to trees constructed using substitutions mod-
els suggested by MODELTEST (Posada and Crandall, 1998; data
not shown). Bootstrap analysis was performed using neighbor
∗
joining. For the ITS, best tree analysis was done in PAUP
using
neighbor joining and the HKY+ i+ g substitution model and
bootstrap analyses were performed in PAUP
(neighbor joining
trees) and RAxML with the GTRGAMMA model. Additional boot-
strap analysis was done for the concatenated loci using minimum
evolution and the Jukes–Cantor model in PAUP
and maximum
likelihood in RAxML with the GTRGAMMA model.

qPCR ASSAY DESIGN
Primers speciﬁc for 10 clades of marine Synechococcus were
designed for use with qPCR assays (Table 1). Design of primers
was guided by use of the probe design option in ARB (Ludwig et al.,
2004), which searches for regions that are identical within a spec-
iﬁed group of sequences and have several mismatches to other

were designed to be identical to all sequences within each speciﬁed

aqPCR assays were not developed to quantify these clades, but plasmid standards were generated for representative strains to check the speciﬁcity of the other
qPCR assays.
bThese plasmids are cloned environmental sequences from Ahlgren and Rocap, 2006 (oc5m66 and oc175m12), Saito et al., 2005 (CRD1 and CRD8) or this study
(CHA22).
cFor clade X, lower limits of detection were adjusted to two times above the level at which this assay cross-ampliﬁed with clade IV, and similarly the clade CRD1 limit
was adjusted to two times the level of cross-ampliﬁcation with WH 7803 (see Table A3 in Appendix).

Synechococcus ITS sequences. Primers were designed so that mis-
matches to non-speciﬁc sequences were concentrated at the 3
end.
Because at the time of primer design only a few sequences were
available for clades V, VI, VII, and IX, reliable primer sets could
not be designed for these clades.

(cid:3)

Quantitative PCR assays were optimized on an ICycler thermo-
cycler (BioRad Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). For all reactions, 5 μl of
template DNA was added to a reaction cocktail of 20 μl. Reactions
contained Immomix PCR mix (Bioline USA Inc., Taunton, MA,
USA), 10 nM ﬂuorescein (for normalization of well-to-well vari-
ability), 0.4× Sybr Green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA),
and 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide. Primers were used at a ﬁnal con-
centration of 500 nM. Magnesium chloride concentrations and
thermocycling conditions (Table 1) were optimized to maximize
ampliﬁcation efﬁciency, reduce ampliﬁcation of no template neg-
ative controls, and reduce cross-ampliﬁcation with non-speciﬁc
ITS sequences (see below). Cycling programs consisted of an ini-
tial 10 min step at 95˚C to activate the polymerase followed by 45
cycles of 30 s at 95˚C, 30 s at an optimized annealing temperature
(given in Table 1), and 30 s at 72˚C. A melting curve was done at
the end of each assay to verify the speciﬁcity of amplicons.

Plasmid standards were created by cloning ITS PCR products
into Escherichia coli using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen
Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). ITS PCR products were generated
using the cyanobacterial speciﬁc PCR primers 16S-1247f and 23S-
241r using reaction conditions in Rocap et al. (2002). Puriﬁed
plasmids were linearized with restriction enzyme Pst I or SphI
using conditions recommended by the manufacturer (New Eng-
land Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Linear plasmids were run on a
1.5% agarose electrophoresis gel and bands of correct length were
excised and puriﬁed from the gel using a Qiagen Gel Extraction
Kit. Plasmids were diluted serially in 10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA,
pH 8.0, and quantiﬁed with Picogreen DNA stain (Molecular
Bioprobes, Eugene, OR, USA). Strains used for generating stan-
dards for each primer set are listed in Table 1. For some clades we
used plasmids from previously generated ITS environmental clone
libraries. Plasmid standards were also constructed for strains from
clades V, VI, VII for use in testing the speciﬁcity of qPCR assays
(Table 1). Plasmid standards generated from cultured strains were
sequenced to verify that the regions to which the qPCR primers
anneal were identical to the sequence originally determined for the
strain.

CALIBRATION OF qPCR PLASMID STANDARDS
To report results from qPCR assays in terms of cells/ml for quan-
tiﬁcation of ﬁeld samples, plasmid standards were calibrated to cell
concentrations by making DNA ﬁlters with known amounts of cul-
tured cells. Cultures were grown in artiﬁcial sea water with 800 μM
ammonium, 50 μM phosphate, and trace metal mix (Moore et al.,
2002) under a 12-h dark: 12 h light cycle at a light level of approx-
−1. Cells were harvested in exponential
imately 50 μmol Q m
phase. For DNA extraction 20 or 25 ml of culture was collected
on ﬁlters with gentle ﬁltration (<15 mm Hg of vacuum). DNA
was extracted from the ﬁlters with a simple heat lysis protocol
(Zinser et al., 2006). Six-hundred ﬁfty microliters of 10 mM Tris
0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0 was added to ﬁlters, and ﬁlters were vigor-
ously vortexed using a bead beater (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville,
OK, USA) for 2 min at maximum speed to shred the ﬁlter and
resuspend cells. Five-hundred microliters of the cell mixture was
removed from the shredded ﬁlter, added to 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes,
and incubated at 95˚C for 15 min. To determine cell concentrations
diluted cell cultures were preserved with 0.125% glutaraldehyde
and frozen and stored in liquid N2 for later analysis using a
Cytopeia InFlux ﬂow cytometer (Cytopeia Inc., Seattle, WA, USA)
following standard procedures (Marie et al., 2004). Calibration
was done for clades for which we had cultured strains: clades I, II,
III, VIII, XV, and XVI.

FIELD SAMPLING
Water samples were collected aboard the R/V Oceanus (cruise
OC375) along a transect between Massachusetts and the north-
west Atlantic in March 2002. Latitudes and longitudes for sample
stations were as follows: Station 8 (Sargasso Sea), 34˚ 59.88
N,
(cid:3)
70˚ 13.92
N, 70˚ 44.09

(cid:3)
(coastal), 40˚ 38.06
N, 70˚ 50.59
W. Water was sampled at discrete
depths with 20 l Niskin bottles attached to a Sea-Bird conductiv-
ity, temperature, depth (CTD) package (Sea-Bird Electronics Inc.,
Bellevue, WA, USA). One-hundred ml of 20 μm pre-ﬁltered sea
water was ﬁltered onto 25 mm 0.2 μm polycarbonate ﬁlters to col-
lect DNA for analysis with qPCR. Cells were collected on ﬁlters
with gentle ﬁltration (<15 mm Hg of vacuum) and chased with
Preservation Solution [0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM
EDTA (pH 8.0)] following the protocols described in Ahlgren et al.

(2006). Filters were ﬂash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80˚C

until extraction and processing.

For ﬂow cytometric analyses whole seawater samples were pre-
served with 0.125% glutaraldehyde, ﬂash frozen in liquid N2, and
stored at −80˚C for later analysis. For stations 16, 17, and 19
cyanobacterial concentrations were determined using a Cytopeia
InFlux ﬂow cytometer (Cytopeia Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) follow-
ing standard procedures (Marie et al., 2004). Synechococcus and
Prochlorococcus concentrations were previously reported for sta-
tion 8 on this cruise using a different ﬂow cytometer (Ahlgren
and Rocap, 2006). A partial depth proﬁle from station 8 was rerun
on the InFlux cytometer with slightly different results, likely due
to inaccuracy in the ﬂow rate assumed by the facility where sam-
ples were initially run. Thus the Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus
abundances we report for station 8 were adjusted by a correction
factor to account for discrepancies between the two measurements.

For measurement of clade abundances DNA ﬁlters were
extracted with the heat lysis protocol described above. Triplicate
PCR reactions were performed for each clade-speciﬁc primer set
using 5 μl of template DNA in a reaction cocktail of 20 μl and other
conditions described above and in Table 1. Synechococcus clades
were quantiﬁed on an ICycler thermocycler (BioRad Inc., Hercules,
CA, USA) using a ﬁve place plasmid standard curve (also ampli-
ﬁed in triplicate) and cell concentrations were calculated using the
calibration curves of cells versus plasmids standards.

RESULTS
PHYLOGENIES OF MULTIPLE GENE LOCI
Because multiple loci (ITS, 16S rDNA, narB, ntcA, and rpoC1)
have been used to describe the diversity of marine Synechococ-
cus, we compared phylogenies of 24 strains inferred using these
ﬁve loci to establish congruency in clades deﬁned with individ-
ual loci. Where possible at least two strains from each clade were
sequenced at all loci (Table A2 in Appendix). Comparison of the
different trees reveals that the same monophyletic clades supported
by high bootstrap values were seen across all loci (Figures A1–
A5 in Appendix). We therefore created a phylogenetic tree using
concatenated sequences of four of these loci (Figure A6 in Appen-
dix; Figure 1) to create consensus assignments of strains to clades
(Table A2 in Appendix). The narB gene was excluded from the con-
catenated analysis because it is absent in some strains (MITS9220
and RS9917).

Sequencing of multiple loci in key strains allowed us to resolve
several issues in Synechococcus classiﬁcation. Our phylogenies con-
ﬁrm that strains previously classiﬁed to clade VII based on 16S
rDNA (Fuller et al., 2003) actually comprise two distinct clades,
VII and CRD1 (Ahlgren and Rocap, 2006; Mazard et al., 2012;
Figures A2–A5 in Appendix). Strains UW92 and RS9920 accord-
ingly retain their classiﬁcation to clade VII while strains CC9305,
CC9317, CC9318, Eum14, MITS9220 are assigned to clade CRD1
(Table A2 in Appendix). Second, the framework established here
allows placement of newly isolated or previously unclassiﬁed
strains into clades. We isolated two new strains, UW179 and
UW180, from the Equatorial Paciﬁc which fall into clade CRD1.
Strain CC9803 (obtained from B. Palenik) is a member of clade XV.
Strain M16.17 (Everroad et al., 2006) clearly belongs to clade XVI
along with strains UW140 and UW105 (Figure A1 in Appendix).
On the other hand, strain M11.1 (Everroad et al., 2006) is more
divergent from other strains than the typical divergence between
established clades (Figure A1 in Appendix), and may represent a
novel clade.

Finally, our phylogenies also resolve the identity of a few
groups of sequences previously represented only by environmental
clones. For example, by sequencing multiple loci in strains UW140
and UW105, we found that a previously obtained environmen-
tal sequence from the Red Sea was closely related to clade XVI
(Figure A5 in Appendix) suggesting that this clade may be found
in waters other than the Atlantic (Muhling et al., 2006). Simi-
larly, clade XIII, previously deﬁned only by environmental ntcA
sequences, forms a well supported monophyletic group with clade
VII strain UW92 (Figure A4 in Appendix). We conclude that clades
VII and XIII are one and the same and we propose that the label
XIII no longer be used. Despite this consolidation of sequences

Ahlgren and Rocap

Synechococcus phylogeny and qPCR assays

into previously deﬁned clades, several clades represented only by
environmental sequences still remain (e.g., clades CRD2, XVII, and
XVIII for the ITS; XI and XII for ntcA; see Figure 1; Figures A2,
A4, and A5 in Appendix).

Although single gene trees provide strong bootstrap support
for individual clades, they did not always give strong support for
the branching order of clades relative to one another (Figures A1–
A5 in Appendix). However, a few clades do consistently branch
together, often with high bootstrap support. For example clades
V and VI appear as sister clades in all trees, and clades II and XV
also frequently branch together. Our concatenated phylogeny of
24 strains using four loci also supports the existence of two larger
subclusters of clades (5.1A and 5.1B) inferred using 11 strains
and a phylogeny of >1,000 concatenated core genes (Dufresne
et al., 2008). That study assigns clades II, III, IV to subcluster
5.1A and clades I, V, VI, VIII, and IX to subcluster 5.1B. Our
four loci concatenated phylogeny supports the 5.1A clustering of
clades II, III, and IV and adds clade XV (Figure 1; Figure A6 in
Appendix). This phylogeny also suggests that clades I, V, VI, VII,
XVI, and CRD1 form a second cluster, but without high boot-
strap support (Figure A6 in Appendix). One difference between
these phylogenies is that the core gene phylogeny places clade
VIII strain RS9917 within subcluster 5.1B, but in our tree clade
VIII strains appear to form a separate lineage, although there is
not strong bootstrap support for this placement (Figure A6 in
Appendix).

DESIGN, SPECIFICITY AND CALIBRATION OF qPCR ASSAYS
Quantitative PCR primer sets targeting the 16S–23S rDNA ITS
region were designed to quantify 10 clades of Synechococcus
(Figure A2 in Appendix; Table 1). Primers were designed to be
identical to all sequences within each speciﬁed clade when possi-
ble and have signiﬁcant mismatches to all other Synechococcus ITS
sequences.

After the design of these primers, additional Synechococcus ITS
sequences have been published, and we reevaluated speciﬁcity of
our primers to all publically available sequences. The degree to
which primers match sequences (with 0, 1–2, or >2 mismatches)
in each clade are shown in Figure A2 in Appendix. In most cases,
our primers perfectly match the majority of sequences within
each clade, and of the 758 total ITS sequences publically avail-
able for the 10 clades that our qPCR primers target, 598 or 79% of
ITS sequences perfectly match our primers across the respective
clades.

It is also important to note that Huang et al. (2012) identiﬁed
several new sequences similar to clade X and reclassiﬁed this group
of sequences into clades 5.3-I through 5.3-VI within subcluster 5.3
(see Figure 1), such that clade X sequences (e.g., strain RCC307)
fall within clade 5.3-I. Our clade X qPCR primers are identical to
most sequences within clades 5.3-I through 5.3-III but have two
or three mismatches to sequences belonging to subclades 5.3-IV,
5.3-V, and 5.3-VI (Figure A2 in Appendix; Huang et al., 2012).

After optimizing qPCR reactions for maximal PCR efﬁciency
by adjusting MgCl2 concentration and annealing temperature
(Table 1), initial lower limits of detection for each assay were
set by determining the lowest concentration of plasmid standard
at which the C T values of triplicate reactions still had an error

of ≤3%. The speciﬁcity of each assay was tested by challeng-
ing clade-speciﬁc qPCR assays with plasmid standards of other
clades and the lower limits of detection were adjusted as nec-
essary. Non-speciﬁc plasmids were tested at concentrations of
1.5× 105 copies/μl, equivalent to cell densities of approximately
3× 105 cells/ml. Except for primer sets for clade X, XVI, and
CRD1, there was no non-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation above the low-
est set of plasmid standards. For clade X, the clade IV standard
plasmid ampliﬁed nominally and the lower limit of detection was
adjusted to two times that value (678 cells/ml, Table 1; Table A3 in
Appendix). The CRD1 primer set ampliﬁed plasmids for strains
UW92 (clade VII), WH 7803 (clade V), and clone CRD8 (clade
CRD2) to starting concentrations <239 copies/μl and the lower
limit of detection was adjusted to two times 239 μl/copies or the
equivalent of 1830 cells/ml (Table 1; Table A3 in Appendix). Cross-
ampliﬁcation of the CRD1 set with plasmid oc175m12 (clade XVI)
was signiﬁcant, so a range of oc175m12 plasmid concentrations
were quantiﬁed (from 1.54× 105 to 3.42× 102 copies/μl). The
clade XVI plasmid cross-ampliﬁed at a ratio of 1:25 (concentration
of non-speciﬁc plasmid to concentration quantiﬁed, Table A3 in
Appendix). Melt curves of clade XVI plasmids were very similar to
those of the clade CRD1 standards (data not shown). The detec-
tion limit reported for clade CRD1 is two times the ampliﬁcation
of the WH 7803 plasmid standard (Table 1; Table A3 in Appendix),
but because of the high cross-ampliﬁcation of clade XVI plasmid,
clade CRD1 qPCR concentrations must be evaluated judiciously if
clade XVI sequences are present at high levels in the same sample.
Plasmid standards used for real-time PCR were calibrated to
DNA extractions of known quantities of cell cultures in order
to calculate and report concentrations of Synechococcus clades
in environmental samples in terms of cells per ml. DNA was
extracted from ﬁlters that were generated with cultures over a
range of concentrations from strains presenting six different clades
(I, II, III, VIII, and XV, and XVI). ITS concentrations determined
by qPCR were plotted against the number of cells in extractions
(Figure 2). Log–log regressions all had strong correlation coef-
ﬁcients, and the slopes of regressions were all very close to one
(Table 2). There was some variability between the y-intercepts
of the regressions for the different strains tested. Excluding clade
XV strains, the calibration curves for the different Synechococcus
strains had similar y-intercepts (Table 2), and calibration points
grouped closely together (Figure 2). This degree of variability in
y-intercepts was similar to the variability seen in previous calibra-
tions of Prochlorococcus assays (range of 0.38 versus 0.46 in Zinser
et al., 2006). The variability in y-intercepts translates to roughly
twofold differences (100.38 = 2.4) between calibration curves and
likely represents the limitations of qPCR to reliably detect at least
twofold changes in copy number (Bar et al., 2003). Clade XV
strains had noticeably higher y-intercepts than all other Syne-
chococcus strains (Table 2; Figure 2), perhaps because these strains
are more resilient to lysis than other clades resulting in lower yields
of extracted genomic DNA.

Regressions were used to convert ITS copies quantiﬁed in ﬁeld
samples to cells per ml. For the clade XV assay, the regression of
all three calibrations (two replicate calibrations for strain UW69
and one for strain UW106) was used (Table 2). For clades I, II, III,
VIII, and XVI, the regression values of each individual clade were

used in back-calculating cell concentrations. For clades for which
calibrations were not done (clades IV, X, CRD1, and CRD2), it was
assumed that these clades have similar calibration curves to the
other Synechococcus clades (excluding clade XV), and the slope
and y-intercept from the regression of clades I, II, III, VIII, and
XVI together were used.

APPLICATION OF qPCR ASSAYS IN THE SARGASSO SEA
Samples were collected on a transect off of the eastern United States
in March of 2002 which traversed from the Sargasso Sea (station 8)
through the Gulf Stream (station 16) and into coastal waters south
of Massachusetts (stations 17, 19; Figure 3). The water column in
the Sargasso Sea was well mixed to at least 175 m (Figure 4), as is
typical for spring (DuRand et al., 2001). The Gulf Stream exhibited
a warm surface layer (24˚C) and a small chlorophyll maximum just
below the surface mixed layer at 40 m. Station 17 was fairly uni-
form in temperature, but showed a subsurface peak in chlorophyll
ﬂuorescence twice as large as the maximum seen at other stations.
Station 19 was located over the continental shelf and the water col-
umn was well mixed with chlorophyll ﬂuorescence levels slightly
higher than the Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea. Water temperature
at station 17 (14˚C) was signiﬁcantly colder than at the off-shore
stations, and the drop in temperature from station 17 to station
19 (6˚C) was just as large as the shift from off-shore to near-shore
stations.

SYNECHOCOCCUS AND PROCHLOROCOCCUS POPULATION
STRUCTURE
Total Synechococcus concentrations measured by ﬂow cytometry
decreased along the transect from the Sargasso Sea to the coast
(Figure 4). Typical for this time of year, Synechococcus concen-
trations in the Sargasso Sea (14,000–36,000 cells/ml) outnum-
bered Prochlorococcus by 1.5- to 2-fold (DuRand et al., 2001).
In contrast, Prochlorococcus concentrations in the Gulf Stream

were >3× 104 cells/ml, 5- to 10-fold more abundant than Syne-
chococcus. Neither genus was seen below 75 m in the Gulf Stream.
Synechococcus concentrations at station 17 decreased slightly with
depth ranging from 5,400 cells/ml at the surface to 934 cells/ml at
150 m. Synechococcus concentrations were fairly uniform (1,200–
2,000 cells/ml) at the coastal station 19. No Prochlorococcus were
observed at stations 17 and 19.

Synechococcus qPCR assays were applied to samples from these
water columns. Amplicons of environmental samples had melt
curves very similar to those of the plasmid standards for all clades
detected (data not shown), further supporting the speciﬁcity of
these assays. The abundance of the various clades reveal drastic
shifts in community structure across the transect (Figures 5 and
6). Most signiﬁcant was the shift in dominance of clades II and
X in the warmer Sargasso Sea and Gulf Stream stations to clades
I and IV at the colder coastal stations (stations 17 and 19). Only
clades I and IV were detected at the coldest coastal station 19, but
at station 17 several other clades (II, X, XV, and XVI) were detected
at low abundance. Clades II, X, XV, and XVI were also present in
the Sargasso Sea station. The Gulf Stream station was unique in

that clade III was detected there and nowhere else. Clade II, X, and
XVI were also detected in the Gulf Stream.

Total Synechococcus cell abundances determined by ﬂow cytom-
etry were compared to the sum of clade concentrations determined
by qPCR (Figure 6). In the Sargasso Sea, the sum of qPCR results
were very similar to total Synechococcus densities determined by
ﬂow cytometry at all depths (ratio of 0.95–1.3), but the sum of
qPCR abundances were greater than ﬂow cytometry numbers for
the remaining three stations (ratio of 1.1–5.7).

DISCUSSION
A variety of loci (e.g., 16S, ITS, cpeA, narB, ntcA, petB, rbcL, rpoC1)
have been used to assess and classify the diversity of marine Syne-
chococcus. A MLSA using seven core genes found phylogenetic
congruence between loci, reﬂecting relatively infrequent recom-
bination between clades and general clonality in Synechococcus
populations (Mazard et al., 2012). Consistent with this, the indi-
vidual phylogenies determined here show congruence among ﬁve
loci commonly used in diversity studies. Because our phylogenies
included ntcA and the 5
portion of rpoC1 not covered in the
prior MLSA study (Mazard et al., 2012), we were able to show that
previously unassigned rpoC1 sequences belong to clade XVI and
that clade XIII deﬁned by ntcA is synonymous with clade VII. We
also assigned previously unclassiﬁed strains to appropriate clades
(e.g., strain M16.17). However, there are still many clades across
the various loci that are deﬁned only by environmental sequences
[e.g., clade XI and XII from ntcA (Figure A4 in Appendix) or clade
CRD2 in the ITS (Figure A2 in Appendix)], and it is possible that
some of these clades correspond to one another. Obtaining new

isolates and determining relevant sequences is necessary to fur-
ther resolve if any of the clades deﬁned by different loci are in fact
synonymous.

Establishing that commonly used loci deﬁne congruent clades
enables comparison of clade abundances measured by molecular
assays that use different target loci such as the ITS, as here, rpoC1
(Tai and Palenik, 2009) and 16S rDNA (Fuller et al., 2003) provid-
ing a better global picture of the biogeography of Synechococcus.
One small caveat in these comparisons is that clade VII as deﬁned
by 16S rDNA sequences actually comprises two distinct clades
(Ahlgren and Rocap, 2006; Mazard et al., 2012). Here we clarify
the assignment of strains to clades VII and CRD1 and establish
an independent assay for clade CRD1. However, it is not possible
to compare quantitative data from assays currently designed for
narB (Paerl et al., 2011) with the 16S rDNA, rpoC1, and ITS based
assays. The narB qPCR primers detect sequences assigned to phy-
logenetic groups, named “A” through “G,” that do not follow the
conventional classiﬁcation of clades established by previous stud-
ies (Paerl et al., 2008, 2011) and in many cases these groups include
multiple clades as deﬁned here and elsewhere. The narB primers
also have mismatches to the majority of sequences within their
putative target groups (Figure A3 in Appendix). We suggest that
these assays probably do not measure biologically relevant groups
of sequences.

Phylogenomic analyses have divided marine Synechococcus
clades into two larger phylogenetic groups (subclusters 5.1A and
5.1B; Dufresne et al., 2008). These subclusters were generally
supported in our four gene concatenated tree, but individual
gene phylogenies could not resolve the deeper evolutionary his-
tory of clades, consistent with other analyses of individual core
genes (Mazard et al., 2012). The apparent rapid diversiﬁcation of
Synechococcus (Urbach et al., 1998) combined with low phyloge-
netic signal from the relatively short sequences used in single locus
trees makes it difﬁcult to resolve the higher branching order of the
clades. Thus, although most individual loci are not adequate for
resolving evolutionary relationships between clades, they contain
enough variation to resolve ﬁne-scale classiﬁcation of Synechococ-
cus diversity (placement of strains into clades), and can direct the
selection of particular strains for genome sequencing to further
resolve deeper evolutionary histories.

It has been suggested that subclusters 5.1A and 5.1B may
reﬂect ecologically coherent groups that share common lifestyle
strategies (Dufresne et al., 2008; Scanlan et al., 2009). Speciﬁ-
cally 5.1A has been labeled as “open-ocean/specialists” and 5.1B as
“coastal/opportunists”. However, the idea of ecological coherence
within groups 5.1A and 5.1B is in conﬂict with the fact that clade
I and IV have nearly identical habitat ranges and appear to be spe-
cialized for cold, coastal, and mesotrophic habitats (Zwirglmaier
et al., 2007, 2008; Tai and Palenik, 2009; and this study) yet belong
two different subclusters, 5.1B and 5.1A respectively. Similarly,
clade II appears to be more like an “opportunist” or “generalist”
type, but it belongs to subcluster 5.1A that is claimed to con-
tain specialist types. Clade II is found in a variety of habitats, in
both oligotrophic and upwelling regions as well as coastal and
open-ocean habitats (Zwirglmaier et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2012;
this study). We suggest an alternative hypothesis wherein clades
with similar lifestyle strategies have arisen independently via par-
allel evolution since the divergence of the 5.1A and 5.1B lineages.
Additional data on clade biogeography and phylogenomics are
needed to corroborate this hypothesis and elucidate the mecha-
nism by which disparate lineages may arrive at common adaptive
solutions to life in the oceans.

Having established congruency in clade phylogeny among mul-
tiple loci, we developed a new comprehensive set of ITS qPCR
assays that detect 10 clades of marine Synechococcus and tested
them in the Western Atlantic. We chose the ITS as a sequence
target because it is much more variable than the 16S rDNA, allow-
ing better resolution of closely related clades. Because the ITS has
been widely used in diversity studies in the past 10 years, it is the
locus with the largest number of sequences available for primer
design. Despite its overall sequence variability, the ITS retains con-
served regions, likely with structural function (Rocap et al., 2002),
that enable robust clade-speciﬁc primer design. This is in contrast
to protein coding genes where third codon position variability
requires either the use of degenerate primers (Tai and Palenik,
2009) or acceptance of a high percentage of mismatches to the
target sequences (Paerl et al., 2011). The ITS assays quantify most
of the clades detected by previous 16S rDNA based probe methods
(I–IV, VIII, X; Fuller et al., 2003) and all clades detected by rpoC1
qPCR assays (I–IV; Tai and Palenik, 2009). Our new qPCR assays
also detect newly characterized clades not covered by previous

methods (XV, XVI, CRD1, and CRD2; Saito et al., 2005; Ahlgren
and Rocap, 2006). Overall, the assays are extremely sensitive, able
to detect, in some cases, concentrations as little as tens of cells
per ml (Table 1). In all but one case, these assays are highly spe-
ciﬁc with little or no cross-ampliﬁcation of other clades. The one
exception is the clade CRD1 primer set which exhibits signiﬁcant
cross-ampliﬁcation with clade XVI (at a ratio of 1:25), but clade
CRD1 can still be reliably quantiﬁed when clade XVI is present at
low concentrations.

High-throughput sequence analysis methods provide new
approaches to quantifying genetic types from ﬁeld samples.
Mazard et al. (2012) have recently utilized sequencing and RFLP
analysis of many sequences from petB clone libraries to charac-
terize communities, and Post et al. (2011) have used high depth
pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA to track the abundance of
Synechococcus clades over time. qPCR assays can still provide an
advantage over sequence analysis methods in their ability to quan-
titatively measure abundance over several orders of magnitude
and in particular to sensitively measure minority clades (e.g., see
Figure 6). Less abundant types (i.e., those less than 0.1% of the
population, as we have detected here, see Figure 6) may be missed
or misrepresented by PCR or clone library based methods that
require enormous depths of sampling to quantitatively measure
rare taxa. There is growing interest in the signiﬁcance of rare types
as potential reservoirs of genomic diversity (Sogin et al., 2006), and
indeed rare bacteria can contribute signiﬁcantly to the metabolic
function of ecosystems (Musat et al., 2008).

The new Synechococcus qPCR assays successfully detected seven
clades in Atlantic water samples, including recently described
clades XV and XVI. Clades XV and XVI were detected in the same
waters from which we previously discovered these two new clades
using both culture isolation and cyanobacterial clone libraries
(Ahlgren and Rocap, 2006), as were most of the other clades
observed in that previous study. Clade VIII was not detected
by qPCR in any samples. This is not surprising since clade VIII
appears to be most prevalent in hypersaline habitats (Zwirglmaier
et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2012). Clades CRD1 and CRD2 also
were not seen in the Atlantic, but the ITS qPCR assays can suc-
cessfully detect these clades in the Paciﬁc (Ahlgren and Rocap,
unpub. data), consistent with their detection using clone libraries
in Paciﬁc waters (Saito et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2012).

Summed Synechococcus concentrations of clades determined by
qPCR were often greater than those determined by ﬂow cytometry.
Application of the rpoC1 qPCR assays to ﬁeld samples has also pro-
duced a similar overestimation of total Synechococcus populations
(Tai and Palenik, 2009). Those authors speculate that this discrep-
ancy is due to the presence of dividing cells that possess multiple
genome copies but that are counted as only one cell by ﬂow cytom-
etry. Although most Synechococcus genomes contain two identical
copies of the ITS, normalization of plasmid standards to cell cul-
tures takes into account this fact. Some Synechococcus strains are
known to possess multiple genome copies, and in some cases cells
in culture maintain multiple genome equivalents at all times over
the light:dark cycle even though ﬁeld populations typically exhibit
cyclical changes in ploidy level due to synchronization of cell cycle
to the diel cycle (Binder and Chisholm, 1995; Vaulot et al., 1996;
Liu et al., 1998; Jacquet et al., 2001; Holtzendorff et al., 2008; Griese

et al., 2011). Natural Synechococcus populations can contain cells
that contain >2 genome equivalents per cell, and the proportion
of the population that has multiple genome copies varies between
samples (Liu et al., 1998). Thus variability in ploidy level in natural
populations across habitats and possible differences between labo-
ratory cultures and natural populations could potentially explain
overestimation of total cell number. Because overestimation by
qPCR is typically threefold or less, we contend that signiﬁcant
ecological conclusions can still be drawn from the order of magni-
tude differences in clade abundances seen across the different sites
sampled here.

The signiﬁcant shift in Synechococcus community structure that
we see in our Atlantic samples (Figures 5 and 6) is consistent with
major patterns of clade biogeography inferred by previous stud-
ies. We ﬁnd clade II highly abundant in warmer, off-shore stations,
as seen in quantitative assays (Zwirglmaier et al., 2007, 2008) and
diversity studies (Huang et al., 2012; Mazard et al., 2012). We found
clade III only in surface waters in the Gulf Stream, the warmest
station sampled (Figure 5). Clade III is typically found in warm
oligotrophic water masses, such as the Mediterranean and the Red
Sea only during summer (Fuller et al., 2005; Zwirglmaier et al.,
2008; Post et al., 2011). Clade III has therefore been classiﬁed as
an “oligotroph” (Zwirglmaier et al., 2008).

Our qPCR assays also conﬁrm that clades I and IV dominate
Synechococcus populations in cold, coastal waters (Zwirglmaier
et al., 2007, 2008; Tai and Palenik, 2009; Tai et al., 2011; Huang
et al., 2012; Mazard et al., 2012). The relative ratio of these clades
shifts over seasonal cycles in California coastal waters and between
different high latitude locales. In our samples, clade I was always
more abundant than clade IV (1.7- to 6.5-fold), similar to obser-
vations in the spring off of California (Tai and Palenik, 2009).
However in the Arctic, South Paciﬁc, and Eastern Atlantic, clade
IV is consistently more abundant than or on par with clade I
concentrations (Zwirglmaier et al., 2008). These differences prob-
ably point to distinct adaptations between these two cold-adapted
clades. Further application of qPCR assays to ﬁeld samples or in
lab competition experiments could provide insight into what con-
trols the co-existence and relative abundance of clades I and IV in
colder, coastal habitats.

Results from this Atlantic transect also provide insights into
Synechococcus community structure that contrast from previ-
ous work. Here, clade X together with clade II dominated the
warmer off-shore stations, but in previous 16S rDNA surveys,
clade X was only rarely detected and never exceeded 10% of total
cyanobacterial DNA ampliﬁed (Zwirglmaier et al., 2007, 2008).
The prevalence of sequences from clades 5.3-I/X, 5.3-II, and 5.3-
III in clone libraries constructed from open-ocean locations (e.g.,
sites UTK211, UTK262 from Huang et al., 2012) together with our
data strongly suggests that these clades are adapted to open-ocean
habitats.

We detected as many as six clades in a single sample (at coastal
station 17, Figures 5 and 6) conﬁrming the oft observed pattern
that multiple clades of Synechococcus co-exist. For example, both
here and in other studies, although clade I and IV are dominant
in colder coastal waters, they are also present in warmer off-shore
waters, albeit at low densities (Figures 5 and 6; Zwirglmaier et al.,
2008). In addition, several clades such as IX, XV, and XVI have still

only been seen to comprise minor portions of total Synechococcus
populations. These clades may occur at higher concentrations only
under particular conditions. For example in the Red Sea, clade III
remains at low concentrations at most times of the year but peaks
in abundance during summer, stratiﬁed conditions (Fuller et al.,
2005; Post et al., 2011).

The qPCR assays developed in this study provide valuable
tools to further identify the speciﬁc adaptations and niches of
Synechococcus clades. Statistical analysis of clade abundance and
concurrently measured environmental parameters suggests fac-
tors such as temperature, depth, light level, and macronutrient
concentrations only explain a portion of the variance in clade
abundance (Johnson et al., 2006; Zwirglmaier et al., 2008). Other
factors not measured, such as trace metal availability and top-
down pressure from grazers or phage are likely to be important
in the adaptation and ecology of cyanobacterial ecotypes (Mann
et al., 2002; Sullivan et al., 2003; Zwirglmaier et al., 2009; Apple
et al., 2011; Strom et al., 2011). Only one study has simultaneously
followed the diversity of Synechococcus and their infecting phage,
and although clade abundances were not measured, signiﬁcant
covariation of host and phage diversity was observed, strongly sug-
gesting that phage impact community structure (Muhling et al.,

2005). Coupling qPCR assays with measurement of these other
factors will help illuminate the ecology of Synechococcus clades.
A mechanistic understanding of clade dynamics within this one
group of marine cyanobacteria will enrich our broader under-
standing of the important drivers that control microbial commu-
nity structure in the oceans and the mechanisms of co-existence
for bacteria in general. Relatively small differences in nutrient
utilization or adaptation to temperature between Prochlorococ-
cus ecotypes can impact ocean basin-scale distributions (Johnson
et al., 2006). Therefore understanding the structure of microbial
populations at the ecotype scale of diversity is critical to assess-
ing metabolic functioning of the oceans on a global scale (Follows
et al., 2007).

aNumbers indicate the degree of ampliﬁcation in terms of copies/μl of the speciﬁc standards when qPCR primer sets were challenged with high concentrations
(1.5× 105 copies/μl) of the non-speciﬁc templates listed in Table 1 for each clade. Non-speciﬁc templates that did not amplify are indicated with “n.a.” for no ampliﬁ-
cation.
bPrimer set CRD1 produced a high level of non-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation, so lower concentrations of clade XVI plasmid oc175m12 were also tested. Challenging the
CRD1 primer set with 3.5× 104, 3.5× 103, and 3.5× 102 copies/μl of plasmid oc175m12 resulted in ampliﬁcation to 1,280, 141, and 14.7 copies/μl respectively, or on
average 25-fold less than the concentration of plasmid tested.

FIGURE A2 | Phylogenetic tree based on 322 positions of the 16S–23S
rDNA ITS. The tree shown is the best scoring tree, as determined by
maximum likelihood score, amongst 1000 neighbor joining trees
constructed using the HKY+ i+ g substitution model and with randomized
addition of taxa. Clade groupings shown in this neighbor joining tree are
also supported by bootstrap analysis using maximum likelihood with the
GTRGAMMA model in RAxML (1000 replicates) and neighbor joining and
the HKY+ i+ g substitution model (1000 replicates). Nodes display
bootstrap values (ML/NJ) where bootstrap support is >50% in at least
one method. Clades were collapsed into groups represented by

trapezoids. The number inside or to the right of the trapezoid indicates the
number of sequences in that clade or subcluster. Clade designations are
indicated with solid vertical lines, and representative strains within the
clades are shown to the left of clade labels. Clade XV forms a
monophyletic clade highly supported by bootstrap analysis (80/86, not
shown on tree) and groups together with clade II strains. For clades for
which qPCR assays were designed, numbers to the right of clade names
show the number of sequences that have zero, one to two, or greater
than two mismatches to both the forward and reverse qPCR primers
combined (0 mismatches/1–2 mismatches/>2 mismatches).

FIGURE A3 | Phylogenetic tree based on 648 nucleotide positions of the
narB gene. Tree construction, bootstrap analysis, and taxa and clade labels as
the same as described in Figure A1. Because of the large number of
sequences, selected sequences are grouped together and represented by
trapezoids. The number inside the trapezoid indicates the number of
sequences in that group. Strains within those groups that have been used in
the concatenated tree (Figure A6) are shown to the right of the trapezoids.
The assignment of narB sequences to groups according to Paerl et al. (2011) is
indicated with dashed lines. Group A, Group B, and Group G encompass

multiple well-established clades as deﬁned by phylogenies of other loci.
Numbers below group names indicate the number of total mismatches that
sequences within the group have to the primers and probe sets described in
Paerl et al. (2011) (0 mismatches/1 or 2 total mismatches/>2 mismatches). For
Group G which contains multiple clades as deﬁned by other loci, the number
of mismatches is also given for sequences belonging to clades II, III, and XV.
Two primer and probe sets were designed to detect subgroups of Group D,
D_C1, and D_C2 (designated with blue lines), and the number of mismatches
that sequences have to their respective primer probe sets are given.

described in Penno et al. (2006) except that sequences formerly classiﬁed as
clade XIII cluster with clade VII strain UW92 and these sequences have been

reclassiﬁed to clade VII. Clades I, III, and XII contain groups of sequences that
may warrant classiﬁcation into new clades because they are as divergent
from other sequences in their own clade as they are to other clades. These
groups of sequences are labeled with a dashed line and a “?” following the

FIGURE A6 | Phylogenetic tree based on concatenation of four loci:
the 16S rDNA gene, the ITS, ntcA, and rpoC1. Tree construction,
bootstrap analysis, and taxa and clade labels as the same as described in
Figure A1 except that bootstrap values at the nodes were obtained using
three methods: (neighbor joining, HKY+ i+ g model, 100
replicates/neighbor joining, Jukes–Cantor model, 1000
replicates/maximum likelihood, GTRGAMMA model, 1000 replicates).
Phylogeny based on 1,129 core genes from strains with sequenced

genomes support the division of strains subcluster 5.1 into two groups
5.1A (blue bar) and 5.1B (solid red bar) (Dufresne et al., 2008). The four
loci concatenated phylogeny in Figure A6 also supports the grouping of
5.1A strains, including clade XV. Strains in clades VII, CRD1, and XVI
cluster with other 5.1B strains in clades V and VI with high bootstrap
support, however it is unclear if these additional new strains without
sequenced genomes form a single monophyletic cluster with all 5.1B
strains (dashed red line).
