Background: Dental caries is one of the most common diseases in the world. However, our understanding of
how the microbial community composition changes in vivo as caries develops is lacking.
Objective: An in vivo model was used in a longitudinal cohort study to investigate shifts in the microbial
community composition associated with the development of enamel caries.
Design: White spot lesions were generated in vivo on human teeth predetermined to be extracted for
orthodontic reasons. The bacterial microbiota on sound enamel and on developing carious lesions were
identified using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM), which permits the detection
of about 300 of the approximate 600 predominant bacterial species in the oral cavity.
Results: After only seven weeks, 75% of targeted teeth developed white spot lesions (8 individuals, 16 teeth).
The microbial community composition of the plaque over white spot lesions differed significantly as
compared to sound enamel. Twenty-five bacterial taxa, including Streptococcus mutans, Atopobium parvulum,
Dialister invisus, and species of Prevotella and Scardovia, were significantly associated with initial enamel
lesions. In contrast, 14 bacterial taxa, including species of Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Kingella, and
Capnocytophaga, were significantly associated with sound enamel.
Conclusions: The bacterial community composition associated with the progression of enamel lesions is
specific and much more complex than previously believed. This investigation represents one of the first
longitudinally-derived studies for caries progression and supports microbial data from previous cross-
sectional studies on the development of the disease. Thus, the in vivo experiments of generating lesions on
teeth destined for extraction in conjunction with HOMIM analyses represent a valid model to study
succession of supragingival microbial communities associated with caries development and to study efficacy
of prophylactic and restorative treatments.

Enamel caries, one of the most common human

diseases,
involving interactions among the oral microbiota,
host immune system, diet, saliva and properties of the
tooth surface. The ecological plaque hypothesis (and its
many variations)
stressed the importance of
changes in local environmental conditions as causes for
shifts in the proportions of species within a mixed plaque
population. The ecological plaque hypothesis also states
that potentially cariogenic bacteria may be present in
clinically low levels in dental health. The implications are
that caries could be controlled not only by targeting
cariogenic bacteria but also by interfering with local

factors responsible for driving the harmful shifts in the
microbiota. Culture-independent methods based on mo-
lecular analysis of 16S rRNA genes have led to an
expanded list of caries-associated species in addition to
Streptococcus mutans, including species of Actinomyces,
Abiotrophia, Atopobium, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus,
Olsenella, Pseudoramibacter, Scardovia, Selenomonas and
Veillonella (611). In particular, recent molecular studies
(10) have associated Actinomyces gerencseriae, A. nae-
slundii and A. israelii with initial enamel
lesions also
known as white spot lesions (WSLs). Furthermore, many
studies support the view that caries can develop in the
absence of S. mutans (5, 10, 12). Consequently, several

bacterial species, either alone or as a group, other than
S. mutans may also play major roles in caries develop-
ment (1, 5, 13, 14).

In this study, WSLs were artificially induced in situ on
the buccal surface of premolars intended for extraction
due to orthodontic treatment. The microbial commu-
nities were followed longitudinally in each subject for
seven weeks and the communities of sound enamel were
compared with those of WSLs by using the Human Oral
Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM), which is a
high-throughput method capable of simultaneously de-
tecting about 300 oral predominant bacterial species
including those that have not yet been cultivated (11,
15) (http://mim.forsyth.org).

Material and methods

Subject population
The subject population consisted of five male and three
female individuals of Scandinavian origin, chosen from
an orthodontic clinic for the study. All were 10 to 14 years
old and had premolars scheduled for extraction due to
orthodontic reasons. Only subjects with little to no past
caries experience were included in the study. A total of 23
premolars were used and the premolars had no signs of
clinical WSLs at baseline. For all scheduled study visits,
participants did not brush their teeth the morning prior
to sampling and had no breakfast within an hour before
sampling. All appointments were scheduled between 9 am
and 12 pm. While enrolled in the study, participants
brushed their teeth with the non-fluoride toothpaste
(Lilleborg AS, Oslo, Norway) and did not use
Solidox

any fluoride or antimicrobials, such as chlorhexidine or
triclosane. The study was approved by the Regional
Ethics Committee (REK sør-øst, PB 1130, Blindern,
Oslo, Norway). The subjects and their guardians signed
an informed consent form before the start of the study.

Clinical procedures
Orthodontic bands with two metal posts (0.8 mm thick)
welded onto the inner buccal surface specifically designed
for plaque accumulation (16), were banded on premolars
destined for extraction during the first visit (Fig. 1). The
buccal surface of the premolars was visually inspected
before the banding. No signs of previous or current caries
activity were detected. Temp Bond NE (Kerr Corpora-
tion, Orange, CA, USA) was used to cement the bands in
place (17). Any residual cement between the buccal tooth
surface and the band was removed. Plaque samples were
taken from premolars at baseline (immediately before
banding) and at the final visit 7 weeks after banding.

Care was taken not to touch the premolar area prior to
plaque sampling. A lip spreader was used to isolate the
premolars and the buccal surfaces were allowed to air dry
before sample collection. The same examiner collected all
samples with a sterile orthodontic wire (Fig. 1) and
immediately suspended each sample in 300 ml TE buffer
(10 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). The samples
were transported to the laboratory using the NalgeneTM
Labtop Cooler (208C), before placing them at 808C
until
the
buccal enamel surface where the band would be placed
was sampled with a probe. At the final visit, the probe
was inserted into the space between the band and the

further processing. For baseline sampling,

buccal tooth surface and the plaque sample was collected
from the enamel surface.

After collecting the sample at the final visit, the
examiner extracted the premolars and the orthodontic
treatment was continued as planned by the orthodontist.
The buccal surface of
the extracted premolars was
carefully cleaned with water, air dried and then the
buccal lesion was given a score in the following manner
(Fig. 2): no WSLs  1, minor WSLs2 and severe
WSLs3 (18).

DNA isolation and HOMIM protocol
DNA was isolated from clinical samples using a Ready-
LyseTM Lysozyme Solution (Epicentre)
for overnight
incubation before using a MasterPure DNA Purification
Kit (Epicentre) according to the manufacturer’s direc-
tions. Purified DNA samples were analyzed using HO-
MIM, which was developed to simultaneously detect
300 of
the most prevalent oral bacterial species.
The method is described in detail elsewhere (15). Briefly,
16S rRNA-based, reverse-capture oligonucleotide probes
(typically 1820 bases) were printed on aldehyde-coated
glass slides. 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified from
DNA extracts using 16S rRNA universal
forward
and reverse primers and labeled via incorporation of
Cy3-dCTP in a second nested PCR. The labeled 16S
rRNA gene amplicons were hybridized overnight with
probes on the slides. After washing, the microarray slides
were scanned using an Axon 4000B scanner and crude
data were extracted using GenePix Pro software.

Microbial associations with developing dental caries

Analysis of microbial community profiles
Microbial community profiles were generated from image
files of scanned HOMIM arrays using a HOMIM online
analysis tool (available at: http://bioinformatics.forsyth.
org/homim/). The detection of a particular taxon in a
sample was determined by the presence of a fluorescent
spot for that unique probe. A mean intensity for each
taxon was calculated from the hybridization spots of the
same probe and the signals were normalized and calcu-
lated as previously described (15). The range of signal
levels was obtained by raising normalized signal inten-
sities to the power of 0.3. Any original signal that was less
than two times the background value was reset to 1 and
was assigned to the signal level 0; indicating absence of a
particular taxon in a sample. The remaining signals, those
greater than 1, were categorized into scores from 1 to 5;
corresponding to different signal
levels. To determine
how bacterial community composition varied across
samples, we compared total hybridization profiles ob-
tained by HOMIM arrays for each sample using corre-
spondence analysis (CoA) in MeV 4.6 (19). Analysis was
performed on the absolute intensity of HOMIM data
(frequency of scores from 0 to 5) as well as binary data
(presence/absence). The prevalence of each taxon was
computed for each subject and averaged within groups.
Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and t-test were used to identify
statistically significant differences between groups (base-
line and final visit; WSLs 1, 2 and 3; and plaque indices 0,
1 and 2). A p-value of B0.05 was considered significant.
False discovery rate (FDR) using Benjamini-Hochberg
correction was used to control for multiple hypothesis.
For the cluster analysis, Pearson correlation was used as a
distance metric selection. JMP 9.0 (www.jmp.com/) and
R Statistical Package (www.r-project.org/) were used in
statistical analyses.

Results

Succession of microbial communities
At the end of seven weeks at the final visit, 75% of the
premolars had developed WSLs on their buccal surfaces
underneath the retention band (Fig. 2). There was a clear
shift of the microbiota from plaque found on sound
enamel (baseline) as compared to plaque retained after
seven weeks (final visit). Microbial communities at
baseline were found to be significantly different (pB
0.001; t test) from the microbial communities at the final
visit (Figs. 3 and 4). For each visit, samples had a
bacterial ‘signature’ for each individual; samples from the
same individual, in general, were more similar to one
another than when taken from two different individuals
(Fig. 3).

circle represents one community from a single visit from an individual patient. Only communities with data for both the baseline
and ﬁnal visit are plotted and labeled by color according to visit. The baseline samples are labeled with solid circles; samples
from the ﬁnal visit (7 weeks later) are labeled with open circles. Numbers next to each circle indicate a patient and tooth number.
The percentages of variation described by the correspondence analysis coordinates are shown in parentheses. Microbial
communities from the baseline visit are signiﬁcantly different (pB0.001; t test) from the ﬁnal visit.

Microbial community of dental health (baseline)
Fourteen bacterial taxa were found to be prevalent in
plaque covering sound enamel at baseline (pB0.01;
Fig. 4). The most commonly detected species in greater
than 80% of samples were Gemella morbillorum, Kingella
oralis and Capnocytophaga granulosa. All species have
been detected previously in supragingival and subgingival
plaque (15). All but Campylobacter concisus and Campy-
lobacter showae are capable of fermenting carbohydrates
to acid, although C. concisus and C. showae can produce
acetate and or succinate with formate and fumarate in the
culture medium (20).

Microbial community of the initial caries lesion
developed after 7 weeks (final visit)
Twenty-five bacterial species were significantly increased
in plaque behind the retaining bands after seven weeks
(Fig. 4). Many of these species have been previously
associated with caries development, such as Streptococcus
mutans, other species of Streptococcus and species of
Lactobacillus. Other species less known to be associated
with caries development included Atopobium parvulum,
Dialister invisus, and species of Prevotella and Scardovia.
Of note, 25% of teeth did not develop a lesion after
seven weeks. Consequently, we compared the changes in
microbiota on pairs of samples between baseline and for
those samples that did not develop a lesion. For this small

sample size, there were no taxa that were significantly
more prevalent at baseline or at the final visit.

Microbial community with respect to plaque index
Communities with Plaque Index 2 are significantly differ-
ent from plaque indices 0 and 1. The average number of
taxa for Plaque Index 0, 1 and 2 was 38.50, 44.13 and 53.68,
respectively. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was used for
each pair; plaque indices 0 and 2 were compared: p-value
0.0014, and plaque indices 1 and 2: p-value0.0247.

Microbial community of initial caries lesions with
respect to severity of disease
There were differences in the prevalence of specific taxa in
supragingival plaque taken from WSL 1 sites as compared
to supragingival plaque from WSL 3 sites at the final visit.
Four taxa, namely Gemella morbillorum, Selenomonas sp.
OT136/OT148, Megasphaera micronuciformis, and Sele-
nomonas sputigena, were more prevalent in WSL 1 samples
(no lesions), (pB0.01). However, due to the low number of
samples (n), the results were not significant (e.g. p0.05)
when adjusted for multiple comparisons.

Discussion
The results clearly showed an ecological shift in dental
plaque over developing WSLs in enamel. Many bacterial
species, including typical caries-associated species such as

S. mutans and Lactobacillus spp.,
increased with the
development of WSLs. Consequently, the bacterial com-
munity composition associated with the progression of
WSL is specific and much more complex than previously
believed and should be explored in future studies. Our
results not only confirmed previous studies (6, 8, 10, 11),
but additional species or phylotypes that were signifi-
cantly associated with the longitudinal progression
of caries in the secondary dentition were identified
(Table 1) (10).

Many of the bacterial species found to be increased in
plaque covering sound enamel and in plaque behind the
plaque retaining bands are capable of producing acid.
Bacteria capable of producing caries need to be both
acidogenic (able to produce acid) and aciduric (able to
survive in an acid environment) (21). It is noteworthy that

non-mutans streptococci, such as those found in WSLs,
are capable of acidogenesis at low pH and typically
outnumber mutans streptococci. Consequently, several
species of non-mutans Streptococcus have been impli-
cated in caries production (13). Indeed,
in this study
several species or phylotypes were significantly more
prevalent in WSLs (Fig. 4).

that

Our results provided strong evidence in support of the
ecological plaque hypothesis,
is, enamel caries
develops due to changes in local environmental condi-
tions (plaque retaining bands), which disrupt the natural
balance between plaque and the host, leading to enrich-
ment of organisms that can potentially cause caries. In
addition, our results showed that many bacterial species
other than S. mutans and lactobacilli are associated with
caries in vivo.

In summary, the bacterial diversity of the predominant
oral microbiota
associated with development of
cariogenic lesions was determined using HOMIM in an
in vivo model. Our results indicate that the microbiota on
intact enamel was significantly different from that of the
microbiota associated with WSLs developed for seven
weeks under protected metal bands. The microbial
communities in dental plaque associated with caries
included species of
the genera Acidaminococcaceae,
Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Veillonella, Prevotella, Solo-
bacterium, Scardovia, and Atopobium. Some of these were
associated with the increasing severity of WSLs such as S.
wiggsiae, S. salivarius and V. atypica and might play
important roles in the process of caries development. The
in vivo model of microbial community succession pro-
vided novel insights into the microbial community shifts
associated with the development of WSLs, and likely
dental caries. Consequently, this model can be used to
study the efficacy of treatment or perturbations, such as
diet, antibiotics, and other prophylactic and restorative
