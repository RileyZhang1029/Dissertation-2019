Viruses are strictly dependent on target host cells for their amplifi-
cation. However, each virus has a unique strategy at each replication 
step, beginning with entry into the cell, followed by transcription, 
translation, assembly of viral genome/proteins, and finishing with 
the cellular release of progeny virions. Extensive studies utilizing 
bio-structural  technology  have  revealed  detailed,  bottom  line 
mechanisms of viral replication processes that we virologists need 
to understand these complex interactions between viruses and host 
cells. We now know that viral genome/proteins are highly dynamic 
in nature, and are impressed by their ingeniously organized func-
tionality in hostile host environments.

To characterize viruses as unique genetic entities and pathogenic 
agents, individual viral components and host factors involved in 
the virus replication cycle must be thoroughly investigated. Many 
viral and cellular factors essential for viral replication and patho-
genicity have been recently revealed through the efforts of gifted 
and diligent virologists, and understanding the functional interac-
tions of these viral and host molecules will require an increased 
use of structural biology and the generation of high-resolution 
three-dimensional  structures.  Of  note,  a  number  of  anti-viral 
drugs have been generated based on such structural information, 
and structural characterization of interacting interfaces between 
virus and host components should reveal potent targets for the 
design of future specific anti-viral drugs and/or vaccines.

In this Research Topic, a number of structural and molecular 
biological  studies  on  various  viruses  by  influential  researchers 
have been published as either original research articles, reviews, 
mini-reviews,  or  commentary  articles.  The  viruses  covered  are 
measles  virus  (MV),  influenza  virus,  hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV), 
hantavirus, murine leukemia virus (MuLV), and human/simian 
immunodeficiency  viruses  (HIV/SIVs).  General  remarks  appli-
cable to a wide range of viruses are also included. Consequently, 
papers comprising this Research Topic on diverse aspects of viral 
replication will be relevant to many different viruses. Hashiguchi 

et al. (2011) review the molecular basis for the interaction of MV 
hemagglutinin and cellular receptors. Inoue et al. (2011) present 
a  study  on  the  translation  of  MV  nucleocapsid  mRNA.  Noda 
(2012) describes a model of native influenza virion morphology. 
Molecular mechanisms underlying the genesis of infectious HCV 
have  been  summarized  by  Suzuki  (2012).  Estrada  et  al.  (2011) 
report the structural analysis of viral membrane glycoprotein Gn 
from  pathogenic  and  non-pathogenic  hantaviruses.  Many  arti-
cles  focusing  on  retroviruses  are  also  presented.  Ghanam  et  al. 
(2012)  review  the  structural  and  functional  role  of  the  HIV-1 
matrix  protein  for  virus  assembly.  Masuda  (2011)  focuses  on 
the  non-enzymatic  functions  of  HIV-1  integrase  and  discusses 
future targeted drug development. Sakuragi (2011) has clarified 
the morphogenesis of infectious HIV-1 virions and discussed the 
importance of such research for anti-viral therapy. Comprehensive, 
informative reviews on cellular anti-viral factors, i.e., APOBEC3 
family (against HIV-1) and BST-2/tetherin (against HIV-2, SIV, 
Ebola  virus,  and  Kaposi’s  sarcoma-associated  herpesvirus),  are 
provided by Kitamura et al. (2011) and Arias et al. (2011) respec-
tively. Seki and Matano (2012) describe viral structure/function 
(HIV/SIV)  and  host  cytotoxic  T  lymphocyte  responses,  while 
Miyazaki et al. (2011) focus on the structural dynamics of retro-
viral genome packaging (MuLV, HIV-1, and HIV-2). In a review 
article, Binning et al. (2012) discuss the potential roles of aptamers 
in structural virology and in clinical virology, with a commentary 
by Miyazaki and Fujita (2012). Finally, another commentary on the 
article dealing with the human/virus protein interaction network 
is offered by Adachi et al. (2011).

We are proud to present “Structural biology for virus research” 
as one of the Research Topic in Frontiers in Virology. We believe 
that all readers should taste the essence and possibility of structural 
virology in a broad sense. We are optimistic that this Research Topic 
will provide or re-generate/re-organize strategic insights into the 
important issues of today’s virology.
