Abstract Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic pathogen in hospital, and the multidrug-resistant isolates of A. baumannii have been increasingly reported in recent years.
A num-ber of different mechanisms of resistance have been reported, some of which are associated with plasmid-mediated acquisition of genes.
Therefore, studies on plasmids in A. baumannii have been a hot issue lately.
We have performed complete genome sequencing of A. baumannii MDR-TJ, which is a multidrug-resistant isolate.
Finalizing the remaining large scaffold of the previous assem-bly, we found a new plasmid pABTJ2, which carries many phage-like elements.
The plasmid pAB-TJ2 is a circular double-stranded DNA molecule, which is 110,967 bp in length.
We annotated 125 CDSs from pABTJ2 using IMG ER and ZCURVE_V, accounting for 88.28% of the whole plasmid sequence.
Many phage-like elements and a tRNA-coding gene were detected in pABTJ2, which is rarely reported among A. baumannii.
The tRNA gene is specific for asparagine codon GTT, which may be a small chromosomal sequence picked up through incorrect excision during plasmid forma-tion.
The phage-like elements may have been acquired during the integration process, as the GC content of the region carrying phage-like elements was higher than that of the adjacent regions.
The finding of phage-like elements and tRNA-coding gene in pABTJ2 may provide a novel insight into the study of A. baumannii pan-plasmidome.
Introduction Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic patho-gen, which causes serious nosocomial infections in hospital, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU) [1].
Unfortunately, the multidrug-resistant isolates of A. baumannii have been nces and Huang H et al/ Complete Genome Sequence of pABTJ2 173 increasingly reported in recent years, which largely limited the performance of antibiotics against its infection [2].
Studies on plasmids in A. baumannii have been a hot issue lately, as the presence of some plasmids was closely related with drug resis-tance [3].
Most clinically significant resistance to carbapenem in this species has been associated with plasmid-mediated acquisition of genes encoding either class B metallo-b-lacta-mases or carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D OXA-type b-lacta-mases (CHDLs) [4].
Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that are capable of autonomous replication, and they can be inherited both vertically and horizontally in a pro-karyotic community [5].
As a mobile element, plasmid may accelerate the dissemination of genetic determinants, such as the spread of resistance genes [6].
We previously reported the complete genome sequence of the multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strain MDR-TJ, which was collected in Tianjin, China in 2012 [7].
The genome of A. baumannii MDR-TJ consists of a circular chromosome and a circular plasmid pABTJ1.
Using bioinformatics tools, we further finalized the remaining large scaffold of the previ-ous assembly [8].
Interestingly, we found that this newly-assembled circular DNA carried many phage-like elements, which was suspected to be a prophage.
This circular DNA molecule was not described when we submitted the previous draft genome.
Further scrutinization of the experimental pro-cedures showed that no cellular lysis was performed following mitomycin C or UV radiation treatment [9], suggesting that this DNA was not likely to be an active prophage.
Moreover, elements related to plasmid replication and stabilization were identified in this new circular DNA.
Therefore, we consider this DNA as a new circular plasmid and name it as pABTJ2.
Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence of pABTJ2 and describe its structure briefly.
Results and discussions The plasmid pABTJ2 was determined to be a 110,967 bp circu-lar double-stranded plasmid with an average GC content of 41.61%.
We annotated 125 coding sequences (CDSs) in pAB-TJ2, representing 88.28% of the complete sequence.
Notably, a tRNAAsnGTT gene was also found in this plasmid.
Among the protein-coding genes, only 44 CDSs were assigned to a known function.
The map of pABTJ2 is shown in Figure 1.
Replication modules The putative origin of replication (oriV) region contained four imperfectly-conserved 22 bp direct repeats, which may be termed as iterons [10].
The rep gene lies next to the oriV region, encoding a 373-amino acid replicase (also known as the replication initiation protein).
This replicase belongs to the Rep-3 superfamily (pfam0151), similar as the replicase of most A. baumannii plasmids [3].
A. baumannii PCR-based replicon typing (AB-PBRT) [3] is one of the most commonmethods used for plasmid typing inA.
baumannii.
The rep gene in pABTJ2was compared with representatives of each group (GR) categorized by AB-PBRT using BLASTN to identify its closest matches.
However, the rep gene in pABTJ2 showed low similarities with each of these groups.
Therefore, we failed to categorize pABTJ2 into any identified GRs using this method.
These data indicate that pABTJ2 would possess a novel replicon type.
The pABTJ2 also contained many genes that are potentially related to DNA metabolism and replication, such as dnaN, polA, nrdA and nrdB.
These genes are normally located on the chromosome of bacteria or bacteriophages but rarely found in the plasmid.
In bacteriophage T4, NrdA and NrdB, which are part of the primase replication complex, contribute to rapid phage DNA biosynthesis [11].
We speculate that the genes in pABTJ2 may also help improve the replication func-tions under stressful conditions, such as the high antibiotic environment or in the host [11].
tRNA gene A gene encoding tRNA was identified in pABTJ2, which is uncommon.
This tRNA gene is specific for the second most fre-quently used asparagine codon, GTT.
tRNA genes are often observed in large DNA viruses or in bacterial genomes [12].
For viruses, tRNA may serve as a recruitment element to neu-tralize the compositional differences between the phage and the host genome, so as to adjust the translation capacity during infection [13].
However, this may not be the case for pABTJ2, since there are four copies of the tRNAAsnGTT present in the A. baumannii chromosome, suggesting that this tRNAmay be dis-pensable for inheritance of the plasmid.
tRNA loci commonly serve as insertion sites for mobile elements in the prokaryotic chromosomes, as they are highly conserved between bacteria and thus allow for a promiscuous process [13].
Therefore, the asn tRNA gene carried by pABTJ2 could also be utilized as the recognition site for recombination.
As genetic elements could be probably exchanged between plasmids and the host chromosome, we did a BLASTN analysis between the tRNAAsnGTT gene in pABTJ2 and the ones on the chromosome to uncover the potential origin of the tRNAAsnGTT gene.
However, the nucleotide sequence of the tRNAAsnGTT gene in pABTJ2 shares no significant similarity with the ones on the chromosome, sug-gesting that this gene may not originate from the host chromo-some ofA.
baumanniiMDR-TJ.
The mechanism underlying the presence of tRNA gene in the plasmid remains obscure.
One possibility is that plasmids may be able to integrate into the bac-terial chromosome and pick up the chromosomal sequences, such as the tRNA gene, in the course of incorrect excision [14].
For instance, the asn tRNA gene in the plasmid pHCM2 was hypothesized to be acquired through this mechanism [14].
Phage-like elements A cluster of genes encoding phage proteins were detected, which were scattered in a 30 kb region at the end of pABTJ2.
Compared to larger cryptic prophages, these genes are iso-lated, which were thus proposed to be phage remnants.
Nine phage-like genes were annotated (Table 1), which encode pro-teins related to packing/morphogenesis and host lysis (mura-minidase).
Among them, 7 genes share similarities with those of the Salmonella phage SSU5.
However, compared to Salmo-nella phage SSU5, pABTJ2 lacks the genes required for the phage life cycle (i.e., receptor-recognizing phage tail fiber adhe-sion, superinfection exclusion protein and phage repressor) [15].
Instead, pABTJ2 mainly harbors some phage structural genes, which corresponds to the non-inducibility of pABTJ2 as mentioned above.
Since many ORFs included in this region are annotated as hypothetical proteins, it is currently difficult Figure 1 Graphical circular map of plasmid pABTJ2 DNA replication-related or phage-like CDSs (in blue) and the tRNA gene (in pink) were indicated in the forward (Circle 1) and reverse (Circle 4) strands, respectively; whereas the open reading frames (ORFs) were indicated in the forward (Circle 2) and reverse (Circle 3) strands, respectively.

The mechanism underlying the presence of phage-like ele-ments in the plasmid is not clear.
According to the GC-Profile [16] (http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/GC-Profile/), the GC content of this region (70,050 nt 106,632 nt) (44.90%) is higher than that of the adjacent regions (38.44% and 39.06%), indicating that the phage-like elements may be acquired through A.baumannii OIFC189 A.baumannii UH2107 A.baumannii MDR-TJ A.baumannii BJAB07104 A.baumannii MDR-ZJ06 A.baumannii BJAB0868 A.baumannii TCDC-AB0715 A.baumannii TYTH-1 A.baumannii 1656-2 A.baumannii ACICU A.baumannii SDF A.baumannii ATCC 17978 A.baumannii D1279779 A.baumannii BJAB0715 A.baumannii ZW85-1 A.baumannii AB0057 A.baumannii AB307-0294 A.baumannii AYE100 100 99 74 52 100 100 96 100 100 100 100100 88 100 0.05 Figure 2 SNP-based phylogenetic tree of A. baumannii genomes 83,560 SNPs were identified on the basis of whole-genome alignment of 18 sequenced A. baumannii strains, which were used to construct a maximum-likelihood tree with 100 bootstrap replicates.

Huang H et al/ Complete Genome Sequence of pABTJ2 175 horizontal transfer.
Genetic exchanges between plasmids and their host chromosome are common [5].
Considering that chromosome usually harbors prophages, the phage-like ele-ments in pABTJ2 may be acquired from the chromosome via homologous recombination [5].
Other site-specific integration processes may have been functional in the acquisition of mobile genetic elements as well [17].
The predicted asn tRNA gene in pABTJ2 may be used as an insertion site for integra-tion of these phage-like elements.
Generally, the site-specific integration of genetic elements through tRNA could generate two direct repeat sequences on both ends, namely attL and attR [18].
However, no direct repeat portions of the tRNA gene are found elsewhere to suggest that this region functions as an excisable island.
Through an NCBI BLASTN analysis, we found that two plasmids, pOIFC189-111 and pABUH4-111, shared 99% nucleotide sequence identity with pABTJ2.
pOIFC189-111 was extracted from A. baumannii strain OIFC189 that was iso-lated from combat casualties in Iraq.
It is 110,967 bp long with only seven nucleotides different from pABTJ2.
On the other hand, 111,007 bp pABUH4-111 was extracted from A. bau-mannii strain UH2107, which was isolated from sputum sam-ple of an inpatient in a US hospital [19].
Compared to pABTJ2, there exist 40-bp stretches of nucleotides in pABUH4-111, which turned out to be duplication located at both the head and the tail of the sequence.
Given the distinct geographical origins, the presence of highly-identical plasmids is intriguing.
It should be noted that, pABTJ2 is neither a con-jugative plasmid, as it lacks the required transfer machinery, nor it is a mobilizable plasmid, as it lacks the mobilization regions either and it is much larger than the co-resident conju-gative plasmid pABTJ1 [7,20].
Therefore, pABTJ2 should not be able to transfer independently.
Natural transformation or phage transduction may be the alternative mechanism through which transmission is achieved [21].
However, whether these A. baumannii strains are able to engage in natural transformation remains unknown, and the presence of endogenous transduc-ing phages in A. baumannii has not been demonstrated yet.
Besides, due to the high similarity in the plasmid sequences, the genetic relationships of their hosts capture our interest.
We thus constructed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogenetic tree using the genomes of 16 com-pletely-sequenced A. baumannii strains and the draft of the A. baumannii OIFC189 and UH2107 published in the NCBI.
It is shown that the A. baumannii MDR-TJ, A. baumannii UH2107 and A. baumannii OIFC189 are very closely related (Figure 2).
Therefore, the close relationship among the bacte-rial strains may explain in part the high level of similarity observed among the plasmids they host.
The presence of nearly-identical plasmids and closely-related bacterial strains isolated from geographically-widespread areas indicates the global dissemination of these organisms and elements.
Conclusion In this article, we reported the complete sequence of pABTJ2, a newly-identified plasmid, in A. baumannii strain MDR-TJ.
To the best of our knowledge, the existence of the tRNA gene and phage-like elements has rarely been reported in other A. baumannii plasmids.
The tRNA gene is specific for asparagine codon, GTT, and this tRNA gene may be a small chromo-somal sequence picked up through incorrect excision during plasmid formation.
The phage-like elements are mainly phage 176 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 172177 structural genes, which may have been acquired during the integration process.
The exact mechanism of the presence of tRNA gene and phage-like elements has yet to be clarified.
pABTJ2 also encodes many genes that are potentially related to DNA metabolism and replication, which are speculated to improve replication function under stressful conditions.
The presence of nearly-identical plasmids may indicate the global dissemination of plasmids similar to pABTJ2.
Although underlying mechanisms need to be further explored, the find-ing of pABTJ2 may provide a novel insight into the research of A. baumannii pan-plasmidome.
