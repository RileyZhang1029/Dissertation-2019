The Chilean sclerophyllous matorral is a Mediterranean semiarid ecosystem affected by
erosion, with low soil fertility, and limited by nitrogen. However, limitation of resources
is even more severe for desert soils such as from the Atacama Desert, one of the most
extreme arid deserts on Earth. Topsoil organic matter, nitrogen and moisture content were
signiﬁcantly higher in the semiarid soil compared to the desert soil. Although the most
signiﬁcant loss of biologically preferred nitrogen from terrestrial ecosystems occurs via
denitriﬁcation, virtually nothing is known on the activity and composition of denitriﬁer com-
munities thriving in arid soils. In this study we explored denitriﬁer communities from two
soils with profoundly distinct edaphic factors. While denitriﬁcation activity in the desert
soil was below detection limit, the semiarid soil sustained denitriﬁcation activity. To eluci-
date the genetic potential of the soils to sustain denitriﬁcation processes we performed
community analysis of denitriﬁers based on nitrite reductase (nirK and nirS) genes as
functional marker genes for this physiological group. Presence of nirK -type denitriﬁers in
both soils was demonstrated but failure to amplify nirS from the desert soil suggests very
low abundance of nirS-type denitriﬁers shedding light on the lack of denitriﬁcation activity.
Phylogenetic analysis showed a very low diversity of nirK with only three distinct geno-
types in the desert soil which conditions presumably exert a high selection pressure. While
nirK diversity was also limited to only few, albeit distinct genotypes, the semiarid matorral
soil showed a surprisingly broad genetic variability of the nirS gene. The Chilean mator-
ral is a shrub land plant community which form vegetational patches stabilizing the soil
and increasing its nitrogen and carbon content. These islands of fertility may sustain the
development and activity of the overall microbial community and of denitriﬁers in particular.

INTRODUCTION
Five Mediterranean-type environments exist across the six con-
tinents of the world. One of them, the sclerophyllous matorral,
located between the Andean premountains and the coastal range of
Central Chile extends between 30˚ and 38˚S. This semiarid ecosys-
tem is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with dry summers
and rainy winters (Gajardo, 1994) and by a shrubland plant com-
munity of hardleaved plant species and small trees surrounded
by grasses (Fuentes et al., 1984). Its Andean part is particular
in that it is covered with vegetational patches of Colletia hystrix
(Clos) a native actinorhizal plant forming a symbiosis with the
nitrogen-ﬁxing actinomycete Frankia (Carú, 1993; Carú et al.,
2003). This symbiosis is an important source of nitrogen input
into the soil resulting in higher amounts of nitrogen in soil asso-
ciated to the plants than in the bulk soil (Orlando et al., 2007).
In addition to nitrogen, microbial communities in the vicinity of
plants are selectively favored by elevated carbon content and hence
differed in their bacterial composition from that of the bulk soil
(Orlando et al., 2007; Farías et al., 2009) or soil associated with
other non-actinorhizal plants (Farías et al., 2009).

The matorral in Central Chile is ﬂanked in the south by tem-
perate forest and in the north by the Atacama Desert (30˚ to 20˚

S). While the northern part of the Atacama Desert is a hyperarid
Mars-like environment, the southern area of the desert is con-
sidered an arid environment because it receives just some annual
precipitation in the range of <20 mm mainly as water condensa-
tion from fogs and heavy dew (Gómez-Silva et al., 2008). This input
of water may sustain sufﬁcient microbial activity to close the nitro-
gen cycle and hence to counterbalance the atmospheric deposition
which could be responsible for the accumulation of unaltered
nitrate in the hyperarid parts of the Atacama Desert (Ewing et al.,
2007). In addition, in the arid zone of southern Atacama Desert
sporadically irregular and short rainfall pulses occur resulting in
temporary increased soil moisture that cause the “desert bloom”
event. These short periods may reﬂect “hot moments” of microbial
activity and resulted in shifts in nitrate levels (Orlando et al., 2010).
Elevated nitrate levels during the bloom could for instance reﬂect
enhanced nitriﬁcation activity which would be in line with com-
positional changes in the ammonia oxidizer community (Orlando
et al., 2010).

In arid soils microbial activity is primarily dependent on the
presence of water (Gómez-Silva et al., 2008). However, nitrogen
is often the most limiting nutrient in almost all of these systems
(Whitford, 1992) and at moderate to cold temperatures nitrogen

Denitriﬁers of arid soil ecosystems

ﬂux is driven by the production and loss of reactive nitrogen
species by microbial activity in the soil (McCalley and Sparks,
2009). The most signiﬁcant loss of nitrate from terrestrial ecosys-
tems in general and from desert ecosystems in particular occurs
via denitriﬁcation which is the dominant anaerobic respiratory
process based on nitrogen (Bowden, 1986; Megonigal et al., 2004).
−
During denitriﬁcation oxidized nitrogen compounds (NO
3 and
−
NO
2 ) are used as alternative electron acceptors for energy pro-
duction. Nitrogen oxides are reduced stepwise to gaseous end
products (NO, N2O, and N2) which are concomitantly released.
Thus, besides limiting ecosystem productivity the process is also
responsible for the production of potent greenhouse gases causing
well-known climatic effects (Conrad, 1996). Two structurally dif-
ferent but functionally equivalent enzymes catalyze nitrite reduc-
tion: a copper- and a cytochrome cd1-containing nitrite reductase
encoded by the genes nirK and nirS, respectively. Both genes were
useful targets in PCR-based molecular approaches to detect den-
itriﬁer communities from a variety of soil environments such as
meadow (Bremer et al., 2009; Falk et al., 2010), glacier foreland
(Kandeler et al., 2006; Töwe et al., 2010), forest (Priemé et al.,
2002; Katsuyama et al., 2008), and arable soil (Throbäck et al.,
2004; Wolsing and Priemé, 2004). However, practically nothing
is known about the composition of this functional group of arid
or semiarid soils. While bacterial numbers and activity in general
but also those associated with nitrogen cycling are low in desert
ecosystems due to the lack of water (Gómez-Silva et al., 2008),
in semiarid degraded areas nitrogen cycling processes may play a
key role to assist sustainable restoration practices (Bastida et al.,
2009). The sclerophyllous matorral has been shown previously to
harbor a rather unique bacterial community making it an unique
habitat compared to other Mediterranean-type semiarid ecosys-
tems (Farías et al., 2009). However, whether this also applies for
the functional group of denitriﬁers is impossible to conclude from
an approach to target the soil bacterial community in general.
The present report focuses on a comparative evaluation of the
diversity of nirK and nirS gene fragments in a semiarid and an
arid soil from two types of arid ecosystems, the sclerophyllous
matorral and the Atacama Desert, and how the genetic potential
for denitriﬁcation is interlinked with potential activity. Although
this report focuses on data obtained for only one sampling, we
assume that denitriﬁer communities and activity were stable over
time spans in the range of decades and hence representative for the
prevalent conditions in these arid areas. These data therefore con-
stitute a valuable contribution toward an enhanced understanding
of microbial communities and N-turnover in arid soil systems.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SOIL SAMPLE COLLECTION
Soil samples were taken at a depth of 0–10 cm from the sclero-
phyllous matorral of “El Romeral” (33˚48
W), Cajón del
Maipo, RM and from the subdesert matorral of “Sierra Pajaritos”
(27˚59
W), Desierto de Atacama, III Región, Chile dur-
ing fall (April) 2006 (Figure 1). Random sampling points were
selected that were separated from each other between 1 and 2 m
within a plot of 15 m× 15 m at each site. The semiarid matorral
samples represented bulk soil samples avoiding islands of fertility
and were taken before the beginning of the rainy season. Samples

from the Atacama Desert represent arid soil taken during the dry
season, without any trace of the “desert bloom” event. To minimize
the effects of small scale heterogeneity 10 cores collected at each
sampling site were pooled and homogenized by sieving to 2-mm
aggregate size and stored at 4˚C.

Edaphic factors were determined as follows: pH was measured
using potentiometry; moisture content and organic matter were
calculated gravimetrically before and after desiccation and calci-
nation, respectively; nitrate concentration was measured with an
ion chromatograph (IC; Forster, 1995).

DENITRIFICATION ACTIVITY
N2O production by denitriﬁcation was determined by the deni-
triﬁcation enzyme activity (DEA) assay (Smith and Tiedje, 1979).
Therefore, soil equivalent to 5 g dry weight to which 5 ml ster-
ile ﬁltered solution of glucose (1 mM), potassium nitrate (1 mM),
−1) were added was incubated anaero-
and chloramphenicol (1 g l
bically at 25˚C. Acetylene was also added at a ﬁnal partial pressure
of 10 kPa to inhibit N2O reduction. N2O was measured with a gas
chromatograph (Carlo Erba Instruments, GC 8000) connected
to a 63Ni-electron capture detector at 30 min intervals during
90 min after the addition of acetylene. Data were evaluated with
the software Peak simple (version 2.66, SRI Instruments).

DNA EXTRACTION, PCR, AND CLONE LIBRARY CONSTRUCTION
Soil DNA was extracted from 0.25 g of each soil composite sample
using the FastDNA Soil Spin kit (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was quantiﬁed
and analyzed photometrically at 260 and 280 nm with a ND-1000
Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop® Technologies Inc., Rockland,

ME, USA). Concentrations of DNA extracted from matorral and
−1, respectively and DNA
desert soil were >50 and 10–15 ng μl
extracts were pure (A260/280 > 1.8). Subsequently, nirK and nirS
gene fragments were PCR ampliﬁed from 1 μl of DNA (mator-
ral soil) or 1 μl of ﬁvefold concentrated DNA (desert soil) using
primers nirK1F–nirK5R (Braker et al., 1998) and cd3aF–R3cd
(Throbäck et al., 2004), respectively. PCR reactions were done as
described previously (Braker et al., 1998; Throbäck et al., 2004) but
1.25 U RedAccuTaq™LA DNA Polymerase (Sigma, Taufkirchen,
Germany) was used. For nirK ampliﬁcation the concentration of
−1and annealing tempera-
each primer was reduced to 10 pmol μl
tures during the ﬁrst 10 touchdown cycles started with 56˚C and
were kept at 54˚C during the following 30 cycles. For nirS ampli-
ﬁcation the reactions were run with annealing temperatures of 57
and 55˚C for 40 cycles. Amplicons of 514 bp and 425 bp for nirK
and nirS, respectively, were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5%
[w/v (weight in volume)] agarose gels (Biozym Diagnostik, Hess.
Oldendorf, Germany) followed by a 15 min staining with ethidium
bromide (0.5 mg l

−1). Bands were visualized by UV excitation.

The nirK and nirS amplicons from semiarid soil were puriﬁed
using the Wizard® DNA Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) whilst the nirK amplicons obtained from the Desert
soil DNA had to be gel puriﬁed using the Wizard® SV Gel and
PCR Clean-Up System (Promega) to eliminate non-speciﬁc PCR-
products. Clone libraries of nirK and nirS gene fragments were
constructed using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carls-
bad, CA, USA). After blue–white selection clones were screened
for inserts of the proper length (nirK, 514 bp; nirS, 425 bp) using
T7/M13 vector primers and inserts from positive clones were
sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3100 Avant-Genetic-Analyzer
Prism sequencer. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using ARB
(www.arb-home.de) and the PHYLIP program package (Felsen-
stein, 1989). Initially, trees were calculated based on >2000 nirK
and nirS database entries and clusters were deﬁned whenever
sequences were consistently grouped together by the neighbor
joining, parsimony, and maximum likelihood method. Subse-
quently, sequences from the majority of uncultured organisms and
from isolates of redundant phylogenetic afﬁliation were removed
manually to reduce crowding of the trees without changing their
overall topologies. Hence, bootstrap values cannot be shown.

Deduced NirK and NirS amino acid sequences were assigned
to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on an arbitrarily
set threshold level of 10% distance using Distance-Based OTU
and Richness (DOTUR) which were then used to calculate rar-
efaction curves (Schloss and Handelsman, 2005). The coverage

CX of the clone libraries was calculated using CX = 1− (Nx/n)
(Nx, the number of unique sequences in the sample; n, the total
number of sequences). The nirK and nirS gene sequences from
the matorral soil have been deposited in the GenBank database
under accession numbers EU645543–EU645573 and EU650277–
EU650316, respectively and nirK sequences from the desert soil
under accession numbers JQ219219–JQ219261.

RESULTS
The soils differed profoundly with respect to their edaphic para-
meters and in potential denitriﬁcation activity (Table 1). The
semiarid sclerophyllous matorral soil receives an average annual

To assess denitriﬁer community composition in soils of the
Chilean sclerophyllous matorral and the Atacama Desert, a
cultivation-independent approach was applied using PCR ampli-
ﬁcation, subsequent cloning, and phylogenetic analysis of deduced
amino acid sequences of nitrite reductase genes (nirK /nirS). The
clone libraries of the matorral soil consisted of 31 and 40 clones for
nirK and nirS, respectively, and all of them contained a nirK- or
nirS-type insert. For the desert soil the nirK ampliﬁcation was less
speciﬁc resulting in only 43 positives out of 70 clones. No ampli-
ﬁcation was obtained for this soil using nirS speciﬁc primers even
if the DNA was concentrated by precipitation presumably due to
very low target numbers in the extract. Threshold values of 90%
amino acid sequence identity were used to deﬁne OTU which were
used to calculate rarefaction curves as well as the coverage of the
clone libraries. Based on this deﬁnition a Chao I richness of 6.5
(95%-conﬁdence interval of 5.1–20.1) NirK–OTUs was estimated
for the denitriﬁer community in the matorral soil while commu-
nity richness was lower with only 3.0 (3.0–3.0) NirK-OTUs (data
not shown) estimated for the desert soil and this contrast was
signiﬁcant owing to the non-overlapping conﬁdence intervals. A
surprisingly high richness was estimated for nirS-type denitriﬁers
in the semiarid soil with 17.0 (14.5–31.9) different OTUs (data not
shown).

The coverage of the libraries was 96.8% for nirK and 87.5%
for nirS in the matorral thus indicating that the extent to which
the sequences in the libraries represent the total populations was
rather high. No singletons were found for NirK sequences from
the desert soil reﬂected by 100% coverage of the clone library.

sampled and thus probably higher than estimated (Figure 3). The
majority of NirK sequences (90.4%) were clustered with NirK
from Bradyrhizobium spp. and Nitrosomonas sp. TA-921i-NH4 in
three OTUs (M1, M2, and M3) in cluster I. These sequences were
most similar (average 94 [87–100]% identity) to environmental
clones previously obtained from rhizosphere (Henry et al., 2008),
mixed deciduous marsh (Priemé et al., 2002), agricultural land
(Avrahami et al., 2002; Wolsing and Priemé, 2004), and sewage
sludge-amended soil (Throbäck et al., 2007). Three additional
sequences (OTUs M4 and M5) grouped in two different subclus-
ters (Cluster VIa/b) and showed amino acid similarity to cultivated
denitriﬁers. One of them was related to NirK from organisms
belonging to the order Rhizobiales (on average 83% identity). Two
others were most closely afﬁliated with NirK from an uncultured
rhizosphere soil bacterium and clustered with NirK sequences
from a variety of organisms [e.g., Alcaligenes sp., Acidovorax sp.,
Paracoccus sp., Enterococcus sp., Chryseobacterium sp., Brucella suis,
Pseudomonas sp., and Rhizobium hedysari (88% identical)]. Many
of these organisms were isolated in a cultivation-dependent study
of denitriﬁers from activated sludge of a municipal wastewater
treatment plant (Heylen et al., 2006). NirK-type denitriﬁers were
even less diverse in the desert soil belonging to only three different
OTUs (D1, D2, and D3) within clusters III and VIb (Figure 2)
and the diversity seemed sufﬁciently covered by the clone library
as shown by rarefaction analysis (Figure 3). These clusters are
both dominated by NirK sequences from cultured denitriﬁers but
comprised only few environmental sequences such as those from
the desert soil which clustered separately from the cultured repre-
sentatives. The only overlap between NirK types from both soils
occurred in cluster VIb which also included one sequence derived
from the semiarid soil besides the desert soil subbranch.

Surprisingly, NirS in the semiarid soil showed a much greater
genetic diversity than NirK. NirS-type nitrite reductase sequences
grouped into 14 OTUs in 9 distinct clusters within the nirS gene
tree (Figure 4). Most NirS sequences in this report (47.5%) were
clustered with NirS from Corynebacterium sp. 12a (Cluster IX)
and were most similar (average 85% identity) to environmental
sequences obtained from a temperate mixed forest soil (Katsuyama
et al., 2008), an agricultural ﬁeld soil (Throbäck et al., 2004) and
a short-term soil restoration chronosequence (Smith and Ogram,
2008). In addition, a signiﬁcant number of clones (25%) were
grouped in part with environmental clones related to the gen-
era Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, and Azoarcus; and some formed
a group with Dechloromonas sp. R-28400 (cluster I). Additional
clones fell into clusters composed of divergent lineages and shared
the greatest similarity with sequences obtained from agricultural
ﬁeld soil (Throbäck et al., 2004) and temperate forest soil (Priemé
et al., 2002; Katsuyama et al., 2008) within clusters II, III, and VII.
The remaining NirS sequences were most closely afﬁliated with
those of Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens C7R12 (cluster IV), Azospirillum
brasilense Sp7 (cluster VIII), Paracoccus sp. (Cluster X), and Sim-
plicispira psychrophila 5408T (cluster XI). However, it should be
noted that the majority of NirS sequences obtained from this semi-
arid soil grouped together forming distinct subclusters of arid soil
clones within the major clusters of the gene trees, which were diver-
gent from previously described sequences in the database includ-
ing sequences from world soils and thus revealing an unknown
diversity of nirS-type denitriﬁers in the matorral ecosystem.

DISCUSSION
It was estimated that globally up to 30% of the loss of nitrogen gas
from terrestrial ecosystems originate from arid soil ecosystems,

at least in part due to the vast area (31.6% of total unculti-
vated land) they occupy (Bowden, 1986). Although this loss was

primarily attributed to denitriﬁcation, virtually nothing is known
on microbial communities in arid soils with the potential to

denitrify. This study addresses whether denitriﬁer communities
thrive in arid soils and whether they may contribute to nitrogen
losses from these ecosystems. Therefore, we explored denitri-
ﬁer communities from two soils, an arid soil from the Atacama
Desert and a semiarid sclerophyllous matorral soil in Central
Chile, and their propensity to contribute to ecosystem nitrogen
losses via denitriﬁcation. Soils of the hyperarid part of the Ata-
cama Desert located between approximately 22˚ and 26˚ S are
−1 soil; Connon et al., 2007) which
rich in nitrate (up to 150 μg g
is introduced into the soil via lightning. It accumulates in the
soil system owing to lack of denitriﬁcation activity caused by
severe water limitation (Mancinelli et al., 2006; Ewing et al., 2007;
Gómez-Silva et al., 2008). In the wetter southern extends of the
Atacama Desert soil nitrate content is much lower, for instance
17.71± 0.17 μg N-NO
−
−1 at our sampling station (Table 1).
3 gsdw
These lower levels are believed to result mainly from nitrogen
losses via denitriﬁcation which counterbalances nitrate accumu-
lation by closing the nitrogen cycle (Ewing et al., 2007). More active
nutrient cycling may indeed be expected due to higher microbial
abundance with cultivable bacteria in the range of 106 CFU g1
of soil in desert soils of the southern Atacama Desert compared
to <100 CFU g1 of soil in the hyperarid zone (Navarro-González
et al., 2003; Connon et al., 2007).

In this study we demonstrated the presence of nirK -type
denitriﬁers in an arid desert soil from the southern Atacama
using a cultivation-independent approach. Diversity of nirK was
restricted to only few genotypes in clusters with NirK sequences
of cultured denitriﬁers and other environmental clones but our
sequences formed habitat-speciﬁc branches separate from these
sequences (Figure 2). Although we did not measure gene copy
numbers, our study suggests that the abundance of nitrite reduc-
tase containing denitriﬁers in this soil was presumably very low.
Ampliﬁcation of nirK -gene fragments was successful only if DNA
extracts were concentrated by ethanol precipitation while ampliﬁ-
cation of nirS-type denitriﬁers failed despite our various attempts
to optimize PCR conditions.

Moreover, denitriﬁcation activity determined by the DEA assay
was below the detection limit suggesting that the number of
enzymes which pre-existed in the soil at the sampling time was
not sufﬁcient to sustain measurable activity even at the surplus of
nitrate provided for the DEA assay. Our sampling took place dur-
ing a dry period without any signs of plant growth, so the data of
this study reﬂect only the status of denitriﬁer communities during
dry periods which may be different from that following a rainfall
event. Activity and biomass of desert soil microbial communities
in general are permanently and predominantly limited by water
availability, but also by carbon (Ewing et al., 2008) and nitrogen
(Xie et al., 2001) or by low C:N ratios (Gallardo and Schlesinger,
1992). Occasionally, however, they can become active in response
to one of the rare rainfall events that occur, for instance during the
El Niño phenomenon every 7–8 years. Indeed, indication of soil
nitrate reduction activity which could at least in part be due to den-
itriﬁcation in the southern Atacama Desert came from a previous
study of Orlando et al. (2010) who observed nitrate disappearance
following a desert bloom during which it had accumulated in the
soil. Further support comes from another study, which conﬁrmed
the potential to denitrify of the desert soil microbial community

upon incubation of the soil at 60% water holding capacity for
84 days albeit with potentials in the low range of all activities mea-
sured to date (Orlando, unpublished results). Interestingly, even
after this incubation or after combined amendment with water and
nitrate nirS gene remained undetectable by the PCR assays used.
Taken together, our data suggest that at least nirK -type denitriﬁer
communities are present in this desert soil, which are predom-
inantly dormant and thus stable over decades but may become
active given conditions become favorable for denitriﬁcation. Then,
during short time spans they may contribute to a large part of the
N-loss from this system.

The sclerophyllous matorral differs from this arid soil ecosys-
tem by several edaphic factors including higher precipitation and
soil moisture, carbon and nitrogen content but lower pH (Table 1).
Hence we hypothesized more abundant and more active microbial
communities. Potential denitriﬁcation activity was detectable for
the semiarid matorral soil albeit only at a very low level. Although
annual precipitation at our sampling site at Cajón del Maipo,
Chile (350 mm; Table 1) was higher compared to, for instance,
that of the Mojave desert (137 mm; www.usgs.gov), the poten-
tial denitrifying enzyme activity of the soil (1.81± 0.41 ng N-
−1) was below the range measured for the Mojave
N2O gsdw
−1) during the dry season
and other desert soils (9–237 ng N g
(Peterjohn, 1991).

However, in agreement with detectable potential activity, nitrite
reductase gene (nirK and nirS) fragments could be readily ampli-
ﬁed from this soil which is indicative for the presence of denitri-
ﬁers. Denitriﬁers of the nirK -type were of very limited diversity
(Figures 2 and 3) and their nirK genes were in their majority
closely related to nirK from Bradyrhizobium spp. recently culti-
vated from an experimental agricultural soil (Hashimoto et al.,
2009) and from a grassland soil (Falk et al., 2010). However, rhi-
zobial and bradyrhizobial symbionts were also isolated from a
mesquite woodland soil of the Sonoran desert and were in their
majority capable of nitrate respiration and denitriﬁcation in par-
ticular (Jenkins, 2003) suggesting that related organisms may play
a major role in denitriﬁcation in arid soil systems. In contrast to
nirK, nirS-type denitriﬁers were surprisingly diverse (Figures 3
and 4), which could be in accordance with the higher numbers of
nirS than nirK detected in another semiarid soil (Bastida et al.,
2009). It may, however, also agree with the higher level of diver-
sity of NirS compared to NirK in an acid soil with pH 5.4 (Braker
et al., 2012), which to our knowledge was never described for
neutral soils. Whether this reﬂects environmental preferences of
nirK- and nirS-containing denitriﬁers is currently unknown, prob-
ably because only few of the organisms which dominate in nature
have been cultivated. Although analysis of molecular data suggests
that the assembly of nirK - and nirS-type denitriﬁer communities
in nature is governed by environmental gradients this is not well
studied (Jones and Hallin, 2010). It is well-known for instance, that
pH is a strong driver for bacterial community development in soils
(Fierer and Jackson, 2006) but this was never addressed system-
atically with respect to differences between nirK - and nirS-type
denitriﬁers.

polymorphism (T-RFLP) to characterize the diversity of the bac-
terial community of the matorral soil showed a dominance of

Denitriﬁers of arid soil ecosystems

Firmicutes and in addition that a signiﬁcant number of the T-RFs
could not be identiﬁed using suitable databases (Farías et al.,
2009). When this study was reﬁned using a cloning and sequenc-
ing approach it turned out that this semiarid soil was dominated
by Proteobacteria but that Firmicutes, Acido- and Actinobacteria
were the next most abundant groups (unpublished data). Hence,
the sclerophyllous matorral could be an ecosystem different to
other arid and semiarid soils with respect to the bacterial commu-
nity suggesting that this habitat could be colonized by unique

bacteria especially adapted to this semiarid soil. Nevertheless,
more information on the functional and genetic diversity of the
microbial assemblages related to nitrogen cycling is necessary to
understand the functioning of these arid soil ecosystems.
