They can undergo unlimited self-renewal and maintain the embryonic stem cells (ESCs)-like ability to differentiate into all three germ layers.
iPSCs can poten- tially provide unlimited autologous cells for therapy and therefore hold great promise for regener- ative medicine.
Here we reviewed the recent advances in iPSC studies on disease modeling and clinical treatment as well as challenges correlated with clinical development of iPSCs, like tumori- genicity, immunogenicity and genomic instability.
In 2006, using Fbx15bgeo as a reporter system, Yamanaka s group screened a panel of genes speciﬁcally expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and determined that four tran- scription factors   Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc   are sufﬁcient to reprogram mouse ﬁbroblasts into pluripotent stem cells, which we called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [1].
The same cocktail can also reprogram human differentiated ﬁbroblast In 2007, Thomson s group identiﬁed another combination    Oct4, Sox2, Lin28 and Nanog    that can induce human somatic cells to become pluripotent [6].
Like ESCs, iPSCs can undergo unlimited self- renewal and maintain the ability to differentiate into all three germ layers.
iPSCs can not only contribute to chimerism and germ line transmission in mice, but also can develop into  into iPSCs  [2 5].

Production and hosting by Elsevier  full-term iPSC mice by tetraploid complementation [1 3,7  10], indicating the totipotency of iPSCs.
Somatic cell conversion to the iPSC state is accompanied by epigenetic remodeling, including resetting of the chromatin structure and methylation states of DNA and histone.
The process of cell fate switching that culminates in the iPSC phe- notype makes this type of cell an ideal model for studying basic biological phenomena such as development and differentia- tion.
The low efﬁciency of reprogramming and long period of time required for reprogramming to occur complicate ef- forts to study the mechanism of reprogramming, which has been widely discussed and reviewed [11 14].
In this review, in- stead of discussing the reprogramming mechanisms, we focus on the promises and challenges of using iPSCs therapeutically.
Disease modeling  Theoretically, patient-speciﬁc iPSCs can be obtained and dif- ferentiated into different cell types with the same genetic back- ground as the donor patient, providing the opportunity to study pathogenesis in vitro, so-called   modeling disease in a dish  .
Indeed, iPSCs have already been derived from patients with a large variety of diseases [12].
It is very challenging to study the pathogenesis of human neurological disease, due to  1672-0229/$ - see front matter ª 2013 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of China.

iPSCs are a practical means of studying the development and function of human neurons.
Spinal mus- cular atrophy was the ﬁrst neurological disease targeted in a human iPSC-based study of pathogenesis [15].
The patient-de- rived iPSCs generated in the study gave rise to motor neurons with the same genotype that is associated with selective deﬁcits, providing the proof of concept that iPSCs can be used to mod- el human disease [15].
In another study, iPSCs derived from Rett syndrome patients were not only able to recapitulate the hallmark defects associated with the disease but were also used to test the effects of drugs in rescuing synaptic defects [16].
Recent studies in which iPSCs have been derived from pa- tients with Huntington-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) have shown that the smooth muscles derived from the patient iPSCs recapitulated the premature senescence in vitro, suggest- ing great promise for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the HGPS disease by using iPSCs [17,18].
Interest- ingly, Liu et al.
demonstrated the contribution of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation to Parkinson s disease (PD), and for the ﬁrst time showed that nuclear-envelope defects might be involved in PD pathology, opening new avenues for PD diagnoses and treatment [19].
iPSCs have also been used to model cardiac disease.
iPSCs derived from patients with long-QT syndrome were induced to differentiate into functional cardiac myocytes that recapitulated the electrophysiological defects characteris- tic of the disorder [20].
Using iPSC-derived patient-speciﬁc cells to model an adult- onset disease remains challenging, owing to the difﬁculties in- volved in differentiating the iPSCs into an adult organ and the complexity of pathogenesis associated with development.
Kim et al.
provided the ﬁrst evidence that induction of adult-like metabolism has a crucial role in establishing the adult-onset disease arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) using patient-speciﬁc iPSCs [21].
Those preliminary studies inspired more-extensive disease modeling studies using iPSCs.
To date, dozens of disorders affecting neurons, blood, liver, heart, pancreas, lung as well immunological disorders and cancer were studied by using iPS- Cs [12,22,23].
Lack of appropriate model systems is a major block to the study of human hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in humans.
Interestingly, it was recently reported that hepato- cyte-like cells derived from iPSCs can support the entire life cy- cle of HCV in humans, validating the feasibility of using iPSC as a model system to study human HCV infection [22,24].
In support of this idea, another recent study showed that hepatic cells derived from pigtail macaque can also support HCV infection [25].
Despite plenty of disease modeling using cells differentiated from iPSCs, generation of complex three-dimensional organs and tissues for regenerative medicine is still a major challenge.
Two inspiring studies showed that three-dimensional intestine and liver can be derived from iPSCs [26,27], providing proof-of-concept that iPSCs can be used to generate functional organs in vitro for regenerative medicine.
iPSCs for therapy  The ﬁrst proof-of-principle experiment involving the use of iPSCs to cure disease was performed by the Jaenisch lab, using  a humanized sickle cell anemia mouse model [28].
Hanna et al.
ﬁrst derived the mouse iPSCs, corrected the sickle hemoglobin allele by gene-speciﬁc targeting, differentiated the iPSCs into hematopoietic progenitors, and then transplanted these cor- rected progenitors into the mice.
This strategy successfully res- cued the phenotype of the blood cells [28].
By transplanting human iPSC-derived multipotent cardiovascular progenitor cells into mouse, Lu et al demonstrated that the transplanted cardiovascular progenitor cells can migrate, proliferate and differentiate in situ into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells to reconstruct the damaged heart [29].
The clinical development of human iPSCs for therapy is still in its preliminary stage.
There are two encouraging clinical tri- als using human ESC (hESC)-derived cells for therapy in the USA that have been approved by the FDA.
Geron performed the ﬁrst FDA-approved clinical trials using hESC-derived cells to treat spinal cord injury (www.clinicaltrials.gov).
Another, more-encouraging trial was performed by Advanced Cell Technology (ACT), using hESC-derived retinal pigment epi- thelial (RPE) cells to treat macular degeneration (MD).
Although no signiﬁcant vision improvement has been observed four months after transplantation, structural evidence con- ﬁrms that cells have attached and continued to persist in the treated patients.
Most importantly, no hyperproliferation, abnormal growth, or immune-mediated transplant rejection was observed in these transplanted patients, and no patients lost their vision during the ﬁrst four months [25,30].
Subse- quent clinical observations are expected.
Meanwhile, a preli- minary clinical trial for transplantation of iPSC-derived RPE cells was performed by Masayo Takahashi in Japan, as re- ported in the ISSCR 2012 Annual Meeting.
Publication of those clinical data is eagerly expected.
Tumorigenicity  The boosting of patient-speciﬁc iPSC derivation and iPSC- based disease modeling underscores the great potential use of this technology in regenerative medicine.
However, to translate the iPSC technology to therapy quickly, extensive preclinical experiments are required to evaluate the safety and effective- ness of this new type of therapy.
The ﬁrst generation of iPSCs were obtained by overexpress- ing the deﬁned transcription factors, using retrovirus or lenti- virus [1,2,5,6].
Integration of the viral genome into that of the host poses a serious cancer risk [7,31].
iPSCs were subsequently generated without viral integration by using piggyBac transpo- sition [32,33].
Soon after, adenovirus or plasmid or episomal vector transfection was successfully used to reprogram ﬁbro- blast into iPSCs, both in mouse and human [34 40].
Moreover, two recent studies showed that both mouse and human iPSCs can be obtained by directly delivering reprogramming factor proteins into target cells without any DNA manipulation [41,42].
All of the aforementioned methods used for repro- gramming can be applied to generate iPSCs without exogenous DNA integration into the host genome.
Remarkably, tumors were not observed in mice derived from integration-free iPSCs up to 20 weeks of age [35].
Recently, mouse iPSCs were gener- ated by adding only seven small molecule compounds into the cell culture, suggesting the possibility of generating human iPSCs for clinical application without tedious genetic manipu- lations [43].
This study indicates that cell fate decisions can be   296  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 294 298  dictated by manipulating intrinsic signal pathways, and repre- sents an innovative breakthrough in the understanding of reprogramming mechanisms.
The cancer risks raised by virus or reprogramming factor integration into the genome could be averted by the use of inte- gration-free reprogramming technologies.
However, whether reprogramming itself can lead to tumorigenesis is still unknown.
The iPSC reprogramming factors have clearly demonstrated oncogenicity.
Oct4 was shown to dictate the oncogenic poten- tial of ESCs in a dose dependent way.
Overexpression of Oct4 enhances the malignant potential of ESC-derived tumors, while inactivation decreases malignant potential [44 46].
Sox2 is a lineage-survival oncogene in lung and esophageal squa- mous cell carcinomas [47].
Klf4 functions as a tumor suppres- sor gene and oncogene in a context-dependent manner [48].
c-Myc is an oncogene as well [49].
Nanog expression has been detected in various tumors and is thought to be an oncogene [50,51].
Recent studies showed that Nanog can promote breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis [52].
The overexpression of oncogenic genes can potentially make cells grow out of con- trol and cancerous.
The oncogenicity of reprogramming factors can transform some of cells during reprogramming [53].
During reprogramming, some ES-like colonies failed to expand when the original   iPS   colonies were picked up, other ES-like colo- nies can be expanded but lack pluritpotency-deﬁned partially reprogrammed iPSCs [53].
Whether the bulk transfection of oncogenic reprogramming factors into somatic cells can cause abnormality in iPSCs is still under investigation.
Immunogenicity  Although it is widely assumed that iPSC-derived autologous cells are immune privileged, the immunogenicity of cells differ- entiated from iPSCs is not extensively studied.
Recently, we ﬁrst showed that iPSC derivatives can elicit immune rejection response when transplanted to the syngeneic mice by using a teratoma model [40].
Although two following-up studies claimed either   negligible   or   lack of   immunogenicity of iPSC derivatives, they both support that some certain tissues but not all tissues differentiated from iPSCs are immunogenic.
Abe group clearly showed that the cardiomyocytes differenti- ated from iPSCs can elicit immune rejection responses (please refer to Sup Fig.
13) [54].
Recent report by Guha et al.
clearly showed the immunogenicity differences between ESC- and iPSC- derived endoderm cells [55].
It should be noted that (1) only certain but not all tissues de- rived from iPSCs can elicit immune rejection response  (2) the rejection intensity induced by ESC-derived allografts differs from that induced by iPSC-derived autografts, due to the fact that MHC-I molecules are expressed in all allogeneic ESC-de- rived cells and only certain syngeneic iPSC derivatives can ex- press minor antigens  (3) if a speciﬁc autologous cell type derived from iPSCs is immunogenic, it is capable of eliciting serious minor antigen-induced rejection of the cells.
In general, we can still take easier advantage of iPSCs for therapy than allo- geneic ESC lines even when immunologic issues are considered.
Genomic instability  Many studies have identiﬁed chromosomal abnormalities in iPSCs, indicating that reprogramming itself can induce genetic  instability.
Recently, sub-karyotype abnormalities were de- ﬁned in multiple iPSC lines by using Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) [56].
Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of iPSCs revealed the presence of geno- mic deletions and ampliﬁcations, suggesting oncogene-induced DNA replication stress during reprogramming [57].
High-reso- lution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed a higher frequency of subchromosomal copy number varia- tions (CNVs) in human iPSCs compared to somatic cells [58].
Similarly, another study showed that early-passage hu- man iPSCs harbor signiﬁcantly more chromosomal CNVs than do intermediate human iPSCs, ﬁbroblasts or human ESCs.
Interestingly, in that study, iPSCs with CNVs were rap- idly disappeared in the iPSC pool during expansion [59].
By using deep sequencing, a recent study detected somatic coding mutations in human iPSCs, suggesting that human iPSCs ac- quire not only epigenetic but also genetic modiﬁcations [60].
The tumor suppressor p53 functions as the guardian of the genome, as it is involved in DNA damage response, cell cycle ar- rest, senescence and apoptosis [61 63].
Recent studies clearly showed that p53 is a barrier to reprogramming [64 69].
Inhibi- tion of p53 activity can enhance reprogramming efﬁciency.
However, whether inactivation of p53 is required for reprogram- ming and whether p53 inactivation directly contributes to geno- mic instability in iPSCs are questions still under investigation.
Perspective  Although signiﬁcant progress has been made in understanding tumorigenicity, immunogenicity and genomic instability in iPSCs, the relationship among these abnormalities and how to overcome the associated hurdles for clinical development of iPSCs are still undergoing study.
Meanwhile, encouraging progress in the development of integration-free reprogram- ming approaches, disease modeling, and preclinical trials has signiﬁcantly enhanced the prospects of advancing iPSC tech- nology from bench to bedside.
