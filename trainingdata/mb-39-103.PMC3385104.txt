Amylases  and  cellulases  are  important  enzymes  that  can  be  utilized  for  various  biological  activities.  Ten  different  wild  Nige-
rian  mushrooms  (Agaricus  blazei,  Agaricus  sp.,  Corilopsis  occidentalis,  Coriolus  versicolor,  Termitomyces  clypeatus,  Termitomyces
globulus,  Pleurotus  tuber-regium,  Podoscypha  bolleana,  Pogonomyces  hydnoides,  and  Nothopanus  hygrophanus)  were  assayed
for  production  of  these  secondary  metabolites.  The  results  revealed  that  most  of  the  tested  wild  fungi  demonstrated  very
good  amylase  and  cellulase  activities.  With  the  incorporation  of  carboxymethyl-cellulose  (a  carbon  source)  into  the  culture
medium,  Agaricus  blazei  had  the  highest  amylolytic  activity  of  0.60 unit/mL  (at  25oC,  pH  6.8).  This  was  followed  in  order
by  P.  tuber-regium  and  Agaricus  sp.  with  0.42  and  0.39 unit/mL,  respectively  (p ≤ 0.05).  Maltose  and  sucrose  supplementation
into  the  submerged  liquid  medium  made  N.  hygrophanus  and  P.  hydnoides  to  exhibit  very  low  amylase  activities  of  0.09
and  0.11 unit/mL,  respectively.  Introducing  peptone  (an  organic  nitrogen  source)  into  the  basal  medium  enhanced  the  ability
of  C.  versicolor  to  produce  a  cellulase  value  of  0.74 unit/mL.  Other  organic  nitrogen  sources  that  supported  good  cellulase
activities  were  yeast  extract  and  urea.  Sodium  nitrate  (inorganic  nitrogen  source)  generally  inhibited  cellulase  production  in
all  mushrooms.  The  best  carbon  source  was  carboxymethyl-cellulose,  which  promoted  very  high  cellulase  activity  of  0.67 unit/
mL  in  C.  versicolor,  which  was  followed  in  order  by  P.  tuber-regium,  T.  chypeatus,  and  C.  occidentalis  (p ≤ 0.05).  Sucrose
was  the  poorest  carbon  compound,  supporting  the  lowest  values  of  0.01,  0.01,  and  0.14 unit/mL  in  P.  hydnoides,  A.  blazei,
and  Agaricus  sp.,  respectively.

In  the  developing  countries  of  the  world  such  as  Nigeria,
uncontrolled  population  growth  has  created  problem  of
limited  food  supply,  which  has  led  to  search  for  new
methods  to  provide  adequate  food  for  humans.  Over
three-quarters  of  the  population  in  under-developed  coun-
tries  consume  < 30 g  of  protein/person/day,  which  is  half
of  the  recommended  dose  [1, 2].  This  occurs  because  the
cost of meat and fish are beyond the reach of the average
citizen.  Most  people  in  underdeveloped  and  developing
countries  in  Africa  cannot  afford  these  essential  food
commodities,  as  a  result  of  low  per  capita  income.  This
problem has led to malnutrition and various diseases,  par-
ticularly in children. Therefore, methods to source alterna-
tive  protein  for  common  people  are  needed.  Edible
mushrooms  are  considered  a  valued  delicacy  that  contrib-
ute to good nutrition such as protein, fibre, carbohydrates,
vitamins  and  minerals  to  the  human  diet  [3-6].  Mush-
rooms  are  highly  nutritious  and  are  an  important  food  in
many  countries  [7-10].  Mushrooms  are  saprophytes  or
parasites  that  are  usually  found  among  the  Basidiomycetes
and Ascomycetes classes of fungi. Generally, they can use
various  agro-industrial  wastes  as  growing  substrates  [11-

13].  The  majority  of  mushroom  lovers  in  developing
countries  depend  solely  on  mushrooms  that  grow  in  the
wild.  Artificial  cultivation  of  mushrooms begins with spore
germination, mycelial colonization, spawn production, and
the development of fruiting bodies [14]. During these stages
of mushroom development, mycelia usually secrete enzymes
into  the  substrate,  which  breaks  down  the  substrate  into
simple  soluble  organic  compounds  that  can  be  transported
into  the  hyphae  where  they  are  utilised  for  metabolic
activities.  During  development,  mycelia  intertwine  with
themselves  and  colonise  the  substrates  to  develop  fruiting
bodies [15].

Enzymes  occur  in  all  living  things,  including  mushrooms.
Every  living  cell  produces  large  number  of  enzymes  for
hydrolysis;  oxidation,  reduction,  or  metabolism  [15, 16].
Enzymes  usually  play  significant  roles  in  mushroom
development,  and  they  also  affect  nutrient  value,  flavour,
and shelf-life of these fungi [2].

Some  important  enzymes  that  have  been  reported  in
mushroom fruiting bodies and mycelia are cellulase, amy-
lase,  glutamate  dehydrogenase,  laccase,  isocitrate  lyase,
and  cytochrome.  Different  amylases  and  cellulases  from

various  fungal  sources  have  largely  been  screened  and
studied  for  their  commercial  utility  [16, 17].  Mushroom
mycelia,  growing  under  submerged  liquid  media,  can  be
used in enzyme enumeration studies [18]. Celluloytic enzymes
play  important  roles  in  natural  biodegradation  processes.
These  extra-cellular  enzymes  usually  aid  in  converting
lignocellulosic  materials  into  soluble  substances,  which
can  be  absorbed  for  vegetative  growth  and  fruiting  body
development.  Hydrolytic  enzymes  such  endo-β-1,4  gluca-
nase,  exo-β-1,4  glucanase  and  β-1,4  glucosidase  are
involved  in  the  conversion  of  cellulose  to  glucose  [2].
Microbial  enzymes  have  been  employed  in  food,  pharma-
ceutical,  textile,  paper,  leather  and  other  related  industries
and  in  biodegradation  of  cellulolytic  materials  [19].  The
objective  of  this  study  was  to  optimise  cultural  conditions
for  amylase  and  cellulase  production  in  wild  collected
mushrooms  from  southwestern  Nigeria  using  submerged
liquid media.

Materials  and  Methods

Test samples. The mushrooms used were collected from
secondary  forests  in  the  Akoko  area  of  Ondo,  Nigeria.
The collected samples were Agaricus blazei, Agaricus sp.,
Corilopsis  occidentalis,  Coriolus  versicolor,  Termitomy-
ces  clypeatus,  Termitomyces  globulus,  Pleurotus  tuber-
regium,  Podoscypha  bolleana,  Pogonomyces  hydnoides,
and Nothopanus hygrophanus.

Enzyme  assays. Sporophores  of  collected  mushrooms
were  tissue  cultured  to  generate  mycelial  starter  cultures,
which  were  established  on  potato  dextrose  agar  supple-
mented with 5% yeast extract for 5 days at 28 ± 2oC [14].
They were then sub-cultured onto starch-yeast-extract broth
medium [2]. The filtrates of each fungus were assayed for
amylase  using  the  modified  dinitrosalicylic  acid  (DNSA)
reagent method of Zhou et al. [20]. The amount of reduc-
ing  sugar  that  was  released  was  determined  by  adding
1 mL  of  DNSA  to  1 mL  of  filtrate-starch-reaction  mixture,
and  the  absorbance  was  read  at  540 nm  using  a  spectro-
photometer.  Cellulase  activity  in  the  filtrate  was  deter-
mined  by  the  method  of  Jahangeer  et  al.  [21].  .The  assay
medium contained 0.55% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)
in  0.55 M  acetate  buffer  (pH  6.8),  and  the  reducing  sug-
ars released were measured by the DNSA reagent method
of Parra et al. [22].

Effect  of  pH. Thirty  mL  of  the  chemically  defined
medium  [14]  was  dispensed  into  100 mL  conical  flasks,
the  pH  was  adjusted  to  3.8,  4.8,  5.8,  and  6.8  and  the
media  was  sterilised.  The  flasks  were  inoculated  with
actively  growing  mushroom  mycelial  cultures  (5-day-old)
using  a  sterile  cork  borer  (6 mm  diameter),  and  the  cul-
tures  were  incubated  at  28 ± 2oC  for  7  days.  Enzyme

activity  was  determined  by  filtering  the  culture  to  remove
the  mycelia  and  measuring  the  activity  of  the  mycelial
free filtrate [20, 21].

Effect  of  temperature. The  same  chemically  defined
medium  used  for  the  pH  measurements  was  used.  The
incubation  was  conducted  at  25,  30,  35,  and  40oC  for  7
days,  and  enzyme  activity  was  determined  as  described
previously [20, 21].

Effect  of  carbon  source. Each  test  fungi  was  cultured
separately  in  a  chemically  defined  medium  (yeast  extract,
2.5 g; KH2PO4, 0.05 g; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.05 g; FeSO4KNO3,
1.55 g  and  1,000 mL  of  deionised  water).  The  carbon
sources  included  CMC,  glucose,  maltose,  and  sucrose.
Thirty  mL  of  the  carbon  supplemented  liquid  medium  was
dispensed  separately  into  100 mL  conical  flasks  and  steri-
lised. After cooling, each flask was inoculated with myce-
lial  culture  of  the  specific  test  fungus  using  a  sterile  cork
borer  (6 mm  diameter)  and  incubated  at  28 ± 2oC  for  7
days  [14].  Enzyme  activity  was  determined  by  filtering
the  culture  to  remove  the  mycelia  and  used  as  a  mycelial
free filtrate using DNSA reagent [20, 21].

Effect  of  nitrogen  source. The  mycelia  of  collected
mushrooms were cultured in liquid medium similar to that
used in the previous experiment. Nitrogen sources supple-
mented  into  the  liquid  medium  were  sodium  nitrate,  pep-
tone,  yeast  extract,  and  urea  [23].  Enzyme  activities  were
measured as described previously [20, 21].

Data  analysis. Results  of  each  experiment  were  sub-
jected  to  analysis  of  variance  using  the  general  linear
model  in  SAS  (SAS,  Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA).  Significance
was  determined  by  Duncan’s  multiple  range  test  at  the
0.5% probability level.

Results  and  Discussion

Influence  of  pH. Five  different  pH  (3.8,  4.8,  5.8,  6.8,
and  7.8),  with  three  replicates  of  each  treatment,  were
used for the ten mushroom samples investigated (Table 1).
Generally,  the  mushrooms  had  their  highest  amylase  and
cellulase  values  at  a  pH  range  of  5.8~6.8.  These  values
fell  within  the  range  reported  by  Jahangeer  et  al.  [21]  for
different  fungal  isolates.  No  or  low  enzyme  activity  was
demonstrated  at  pH  3.8,  which  may  have  been  attributed
to  toxicity  and  consequent  damage  inflicted  on  the  cell
walls  and  membranes  at  a  highly  acidic  pH.  Griffin  [24]
and  Garraway  and  Evans  [25]  independently  suggested
that  cell  membrane  permeability  may  be  adversely  affected
at highly acidic pH. Jonathan [2] reported that a pH of 4.0
(and below) resulted in negative effects on cell membrane
regulatory  function,  in  the  passage  of  essential  nutrients

needed  for  enzyme  action,  the  metabolic  role  and  vegeta-
tive growth of some Nigerian higher fungi.

The highest cellulase activity (0.67 unit/mL) was recorded
in  Coriolus  versicolor  at  a  pH  of  6.8  followed  in  order
(p ≥ 0.05)  by  P.  tuber-regium,  T.  clypeatus  and  C.  occi-
dentalis.  Apart  from  N.  hygrophanus  and  P.  bolleana,
which  showed  0.18  and  0.22 unit/mL  of  cellulase  activity
at pH 5.5, all other fungi had their highest cellulase activi-
ties  at  a  slightly  acidic  pH  of  6.8  (Table  1).  The  lowest
cellulase  activity  (0.02 units/mL)  was  observed  for  N.
hygrophorus  at  pH  3.8  and  C.  occidentalis,  A.  blazei  and
P.  tuber-regium  demonstrated  no  enzyme  activity  at  pH
3.8.  Pleurotus  tuber-regium  and  Agaricus  sp.  had  the
highest  amylolytic  activity  values  of  0.6,  0.42,  and  0.39
unit/mL,  respectively,  at  a  pH  of  6.8,  whereas  P.  hyd-
noides  and  N.  hygrophanus  had  the  lowest  values  of  0.09
and  0.08 unit/mL,  respectively,  at  pH  3.8  (Table  1).  The

reasons  for  the  better  cellulase  than  amylase  activity  may
be  attributed  to  the  habitat  and  the  substrates  where  the
mushrooms grow.

Influence  of  temperature. The  influence  of  tempera-
ture  on  enzyme  action  in  the  mushrooms  is  presented  in
Table 2. The highest amylase and cellulase activities were
noted  between  25  and  30oC.  At  25oC,  C.  versicolor  dem-
onstrated  the  highest  cellulase  activity  of  0.67 unit/mL,
followed  by  P.  tuber-regium  and  T.  clypeatus  with  0.64
and 0.56 unit/mL, respectively. Other mushrooms that had
very  high  cellulase  activity  at  25oC  were  Pogonomyces
hydnoides,  Podoscyha  bolleana,  A.  blazei,  and  Agaricus
sp.  Mushrooms  that  had  their  maximum  cellulase  action
at  30oC  were  N.  hygrophanus,  P.  bollean,  C.  occidentalis,
T.  globulus,  and  P.  tuber-regium.  A  similar  effect  of  tem-
perature  on  laccase  production  was  reported  in  Schizo-

phyllum commune by Adejoye and Fasidi [26]. Gbolagade
et al. [6] also obtained very good biomass yield within the
temperature range of 25~30oC. The high cellulolytic activ-
ities  in  C.  versicolor  and  P.  tuber-regium  may  be  associ-
ated  with  their  natural  habitats.  Both  fungi  are  wood
degrading fungi [27].

Very  good  amylase  activities  (0.60  and  0.24 unit/mL)
were recorded for A. blazei and Podoscyha bolleana at 25
and  30oC,  respectively  (Table  2).  Conversely,  little  or  no
amylase  and  cellulase  activity  were  observed  at  35  and
40oC.  Enzyme  activity  is  reduced  at  high  temperatures
[24].  Table  2  results  are  similar  to  those  obtained  by
Jayasinghe  et  al.  [27],  who  suggested  that  25~30oC  was  a
favourable  temperature  for  mycelial  growth  of  a  wild
strain of Ganoderma lucidum from Korea. Similarly, Ade-
joye  and  Fasidi  [26]  reported  that  28oC  was  the  optimum
temperature  for  producing  laccase  in  S.  commune.  How-
ever,  Fasdi  [4] reported  that  35oC  is  an  ideal  temperature
for mycelial yield of V. esculenta.

Carbohydrate  sources. All  four  carbon  compounds
(CMC,  glucose,  maltose,  and  sucrose)  significantly
enhanced  amylase  and  cellulase  production  in  the  tested
fungi  (Table  3).  CMC  promoted  the  highest  cellulase
activities  (0.67  and  0.64  unit/mL)  in  C.  versicolor  and  P.
tuber-regium,  respectively.  CMC  also  stimulated  very
good  amylase  activity  (0.60 unit/mL)  in  A.  blazei.  The
high performance of these two fungi in CMC may be due
to the availability of cellulase, which catalyses the hydrol-
ysis  of  cellulose  to  assimilable  simple  sugars.  This  result
is  different  from  that  reported  by  Fasidi  [4]  for  V.  escu-
lenta.  He  found  that  glucose  and  fructose  stimulated
mycelial  biomass  production  most  in  V.  esculenta.  This
difference  may  be  due  to  the  genera  of  the  mushrooms
used.

Glucose  also  enhanced  significant  enzyme  activity  in

all  tested  mushrooms  (Table  3).  Hexose  stimulated  cellu-
lase production in C. occidentalis (0.60 unit/mL), Pogono-
myces  hydnoides  (0.25 units/mL),  N.  hygrophanus  (0.24
unit/mL)  and  Podoscyha  bolleana  (0.22 units/mL).  Simi-
lar utilization of glucose was reported by  Jonathan [2] for
different  Nigerian  higher  fungi,  Jayasinghe  et  al.  [27]  and
Adejoye  and  Fasidi  [26]  reported  glucose  as  the  most
stimulatory  carbohydrate  source  for  mycelial  production
in  G.  lucidum  and  S.  commune.  Glucose  utilization  for
enzyme  production  may  be  attributed  to  the  ease  by
which  this  sugar  is  oxidized  to  produce  cellular  energy.
Generally,  the  two  disaccharides  (maltose  and  sucrose)
used in this study were not supportive of insul for enzyme
production,  which  agreed  with  an  earlier  observation  by
Gbolagade  et  al.  [6],  who  suggested  that  oligosaccharides
must  be  hydrolysed  to  simple  sugars  before  they  can  be
incorporated into the fungal cell.

Nitrogen  compounds. The  effect  of  four  nitrogen
sources on amylase and cellulase activities in the fungi are
presented  in  Table  4.  The  highest  cellulase  activity  (0.68
units/mL)  was  observed  in  C.  versicolor  in  yeast  extract
substituted  submerged  liquid  medium.  Other  mushrooms
that  had  very  good  cellulase  activities  with  this  complex
nitrogen  source  were  P.  hydnoides,  T.  clypeatus,  T.  globu-
lus,  P.  tuber-regium,  and  Agaricus  sp.  Jonathan  [2]  also
obtained  the  highest  mycelial  biomass  yield  in  L.  subnu-
dus,  P.  giganteus,  and  P.  atrombonata  with  yeast  extract.
Adejoye  and  Fasidi  [26]  reported  very  good  biomass  and
laccase  production  in  S.  commune  using  a  yeast  extract.
Enhanced  enzyme  production  by  the  yeast  extract  may
also be attributed to its high vitamin and amino acid com-
position [14].

Urea  was  also  stimulatory  to  cellulase  production  in  P.
tuber-regium and N. hygrophanus with values of 0.61 and
0.20 units/mL,  respectively  (Table  4).  Urea  also  enhanced

AML,  amylase;  CEL,  cellulase.

amylase  activities  in  P.  tuber-regium,  Agaricus  sp.,  C.
occidentalis,  and  A.  blazei  of  0.43,  0.37,  0.30,  and  0.30
unit/mL,  respectively. This  was  different  from  that reported
by Gbolagade [28], who found a very low biomass yield of
Lepiota  procera  using  urea.  The  difference  observed  here
may  be  attributed  to  differences  in  the  nutrient  require-
ments  of  various  fungi.  Peptone  was  also  supportive  of
moderate  amylase  activity  (0.19 unit/mL)  in  P.  bolleana.
Similar  stimulation  of  mycelial  biomass  by  peptone  was
reported by Gbolagade [28] for L. procera. Sodium nitrate
(an inorganic nitrogen source) enhanced low enzyme  activ-
ity  in  all  mushrooms  assayed.  Gbolagade  et  al.  [6]
reported  that  biomass  production  in  Pleurotus  florida  was
enhanced  by  organic  nitrogen  sources,  whereas  inorganic
nitrogen  compounds  generally  inhibited  growth  of  this
edible fungus.
