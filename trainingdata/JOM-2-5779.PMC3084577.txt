Preterm and low birthweight (PTLBW) continues to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity across the
world. In recent years, maternal periodontal disease has been implicated as a risk factor for adverse
pregnancy outcomes. There is conflicting evidence to support such an outcome as illustrated by descriptive,
case control and randomised controlled trials involving pregnant women from across the world, using
different measurement tools to determine the level of periodontal disease. Whilst considering the literature,
there is evidence for both arguments, based on the effect of periodontal inflammatory by products. Bacteria
associated with periodontal disease are not dissimilar to those known to be associated with genito-urinary
bacterial
infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Several groups have demonstrated the apparent
translocation of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonus
gingivalis, Treponema denticola to the foetal placental unit whereby a maternal or foetal response has been
detected resulting in premature birth or low birthweight. The normal process of parturition involves a cascade
of events including a build-up of inflammatory mediators as linked to inflammation, whereby the maternal
environment becomes hostile and threatens the well-being of the infant, and the foetus expelled. The question
remains therefore, is there a greater risk of delivering a PTLBW infant when the mother has detectable
periodontal disease, or is the release of
inflammatory mediators and their translocation via the
haematogenous route sufficient to induce a poor pregnancy outcome? The data investigated would suggest
that there is a positive outcome when certain oral gram-negative bacteria create a cumulative effect sufficient
to trigger early delivery, which represents the final straw to result in preterm or low birthweight delivery.
There is equally sufficient epidemiological evidence that does not support this outcome, but it is agreed that
maintaining oral health during pregnancy is beneficial to the mother and her infant.

Low birthweight

is a major cause of
infant mortality and morbidity around the world.
The reality being that 10% of all
live births
are preterm, 1 in 14 babies are born underweight or
premature and preterm birth (PTB) accounts for two-
thirds of all infant mortality. In addition to this, those
premature or LBW babies who survive suffer health
problems including neurological, asthma, cerebral palsy,
poor motor skills, and functional disability, some of
which are long-term and the associated costs have been
estimated to be in the region of $17.2 billion per year (1).
Hence, the need to fully understand which of the risk
factors associated with preterm and low birthweight
infants (PTLBW) are key, and being able to target
aspects of poor pregnancy outcome to reduce the chances
of such events occurring.

For the last 15 years or so, maternal periodontal
disease has been implicated in poor pregnancy outcome.
Offenbacher and his group in 1996 reported a sevenfold
increased risk of a mother with periodontal disease
delivering a PTLBW baby (2). This observation was
difficult to ignore and since then many studies have
been completed but with varying results. Since 2001,
several systematic and non-systematic reviews have been
published (37), which have more often than not concluded
the data available to be inconsistent and recommended that
more rigorously designed studies should be conducted (6).
There are aspects of the relationship that require careful
consideration as part of understanding and unravelling its
complexity. These include: the aetiology, natural history,
and epidemiology of periodontal disease; the same for
PTLBW or poor pregnancy outcomes; known and proven

risk factors for both periodontal disease and PTLBW;
and finally study design to include consideration of
confounders.

Periodontal disease
Periodontal disease is a chronic, low grade, gram-negative
anaerobic infection of the periodontal tissues that is
associated with an increase in systemic levels of inflam-
matory cytokines that, in turn, causes destruction of soft
and hard periodontal tissues characterised by gingivitis
and periodontitis (8, 9). Of the many oral bacteria, those
that are most often associated with poor pregnancy
outcome include Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter
rectus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella nigrescens,
Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonus gingivalis, Bacter-
oides forsythus, Treponema denticola. These bacteria have
been divided into a series of complexes or clusters namely
purple, yellow, green, orange, and red (10). The orange
cluster is considered to be important in terms of the
maturation of the biofilm and enabling the colonisation
of
the red-complex organisms such as P. gingivalis,
B. forsythus, and T. denticola. It has been demonstrated
by several groups that oral bacteria ‘translocate’ to the
foetal placental unit and induce a maternal or foetal
response that can result in the premature birth of an infant
(11). The systemic dissemination via the haematogenous
route of inflammatory mediators and prostaglandins such
as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a, PGE2 originating from the
periodontal inflammatory process are not dissimilar to
those associated with the onset of labour. Therefore, is the
onset of labour a single or cumulative effect of the increased
levels of
inflammatory process originating from the
infected periodontium that acts as a reservoir for microbial
products and inflammatory mediators (1215)?

Poor pregnancy outcome
Poor pregnancy outcomes may include PTB that is a
gestational age of less than 37 weeks with very premature
at less than 32 weeks; LBW when a baby is born weighing
less than 2,500 g; very or extremely LBW of under 1,500 g
or 1,000 g, respectively; or premature birth or early onset
of physiological pregnancy with or without obstetric
complications such as premature labour, miscarriage, or
early pregnancy loss and stillbirth (16).

Parturition is a normal process and characterised
by coordinated uterine contractions leading to cervical
dilatation and delivery of the foetus. Neurogenic reflexes
stimulated by the stretch of the uterine muscle, foetal
activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and
production of oxytocin and prostanoids lead to the event of
labour and delivery of an infant. Additionally, endocrine
mediators, prostaglandins, cytokines, and chemokines also
play an important role in the labour process (17).

Infections from whichever source during pregnancy,
maternal haemorrhage, placenta ischaemia, and stress may

cause alterations to normal cytokine and hormone
regulated gestation and result in preterm labour, premature
rupture of membranes, or preterm birth (1820). Romero
and Mazor characterise the event of preterm labour as
when the intrauterine or maternal environment becomes
hostile and threatens the well-being of the host and,
hence, expulsion of the foetus (18). Whereas Challis and
colleagues regard PTB to be when there is asynchrony
and the normal process of parturition takes place early
and foetal maturation is delayed (17).

the

extrapolation that

Link between periodontal disease and preterm
low birthweight (PTLBW)
Periodontal disease is no different to any other infection
in its outcome; it is therefore plausible that oral bacteria
could contribute to poor or adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Opportunistic pathogens including Prevotella, Porphyro-
monus, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus species are known
to be associated with and found in the lower genital tract
and detected in pelvic infections such as bacterial
vaginosis, the clinical syndrome based on altered genital
microflora. Hence,
similar
oral microbial species might be associated with and have
a role in the labour process. This can be justified by
the premise that increased numbers of oral gram-negative
anaerobic bacteria elicit inflammatory responses, induce
tissue destruction, and produce a wider systemic impact
(21, 22). The question is how and by which route oral
bacteria and their resulting inflammatory products reach
the foetal-placental unit? The accepted pathways for
intrauterine infection include: ascending through the
vagina and cervix, haematogenous dissemination through
the placenta, retrograde seeding from the peritoneal
cavity, and by accidental introduction during intrauterine
procedures such as amniocentesis (18). The haematogen-
ous route is the most likely route in terms of oral bacteria
and has been implicated in the delivery of PTB and or
LBW infants, threatened labour, miscarriage, or stillbirth
(2, 15, 23, 24). Using an animal model, Collins and
colleagues have demonstrated that by implanting a
subcutaneous chamber containing P. gingivalis into a
hamster, foetal weight of the hamster ‘pups’ was signifi-
cantly reduced in the test group, and TNF-a and PGE2
levels increased in the chamber (13). Hill further demon-
strated that Fusobacterium nucleatum can be isolated from
amniotic fluid cultures of women with preterm labour and
intact membranes suggesting the transient bacteraemia
had originated from the mouth via haematogenous spread
and infection of the amniotic fluid through the placenta
(25). More recently, Han and colleagues have reported
a term stillbirth case by association was caused by
F. nucleatum (24), she had previously demonstrated that
F. nucleatum induced premature and term stillbirths in
pregnant mice (26).

Risk factors
Risk factors associated with both periodontal disease and
poor pregnancy outcomes that might result in early
parturition include maternal age, ethnicity, social class,
education,
illness, gram-
negative anaerobic microorganisms, and smoking (21, 23,
2730). However, there are other specific risk factors, for
example, poor oral hygiene for periodontal disease,
antenatal care, parity, previous poor pregnancy out-
come (miscarriage, stillbirth, PLB, prematurity), cervical
incompetence, or
intrauterine inflammation are all
associated with PTLBW, PTB, and LBW (18, 19). Risk
factors associated with poor pregnancy outcomes occur in
combination and not alone and, therefore, developing
preventive strategies can be challenging to be effective (31).

Study design
The variability of study design has created uncertainty
about the validity of studies (32, 33), it has been suggested
that this may be in part due to the many definitions
and parameters used in the measurement of periodontal
disease and pregnancy outcome (7). Such discrepancies
are mainly associated with the diagnostic measurement of
periodontal disease, either using periodontal indices such
as CPITN or BPE, clinical attachment levels, bleeding
on probing, and pocket depth compounded by the use of
different periodontal probes. These inconsistencies are
often driven by the need for simplicity, pragmatism, and
the availability of mothers and accuracy of birth data. For
example, mothers may only be accessible at the time of
delivery and on the post-natal ward (30) or attending
antenatal or ultrasound clinics (34). The acquisition and
viability of clinical samples such as dental plaque, gingival
crevicular fluid (14), blood serum, vaginal swabs, amniotic
fluid, chorioamnion tissue (35), and umbilical and foetal
cord blood (11, 18, 36) are crucial to the hypothesis
testing. Timing is also significant in terms of the stage of
pregnancy such as at parturition,
including caesarean
section (35), during the neonatal period (23, 37), or earlier
in the pregnancy at 26 weeks or less gestation (9, 34, 38).
The transferability of study outcomes across populations
may also be limited because of the difficulties with
replication of population demographics and sample
collection (15, 30, 39).

Despite these perceived problems, work continues to
eliminate the inconsistencies that have arisen, if only to
identify unknown risk factors that might account for why
50% of mothers delivering a preterm baby do not have
any known risk factors (11).

The original work carried out by Offenbacher and
colleagues, as reported in 1996 and 1998 and as mentioned
earlier, promoted the need to investigate further the link
between gram-negative oral bacteria and poor pregnancy
outcomes (2, 14). Offenbacher and colleagues reported
a sevenfold risk of mothers with periodontal disease

PT-LBW and the role of oral bacteria

delivering a preterm low birth infant weight (2). A very
small study followed in 1998 and provided early data
supporting the oral bacteria and foetal-placental link.
Here, 40 women volunteered either immediately before
or within 3 days post-partum, gingival crevicular fluid
levels of PGE2 and Il-1b were increased, and P. gingivalis,
Actinobacillus actinomycetencomitans, and T. denticola
were also detected at higher levels in PTLBW mothers
as compared to normal birthweight controls
(14).
These studies were small and opportunistic rather than
adequately designed to demonstrate a reliable outcome.

In response, a prospective 5-year study titled The Oral
Conditions and Pregnancy (OCAP) was designed to
investigate the relationship between maternal periodontal
disease and poor pregnancy outcomes such as preterm
birth (B37 weeks gestation), and very preterm birth (B26
weeks gestation), LBW (B2,500 g), and pre-eclampsia.
These studies have provided a means to unpick the
apparent oral infection link to the foetal-placental unit
and subsequent poor pregnancy outcomes but sample a
particular population. Resulting subsets of data involving
640 to 1,224 women enrolled from prenatal clinics in
Durham, North Carolina, at 26 weeks pregnancy have
been reported by Offenbacher’s group and provide
evidence to support the relationship between maternal
periodontal disease and poor pregnancy outcome (9, 11,
36, 38, 40).

Lieff and co-workers described the oral health of
pregnant women enrolled in the prospective OCAP study.
Where 58.7% of the women were primaparous, 45.9%
were black, and 48.7% were unmarried. The clinical and
delivery differences were found to be minimal over the
time period; however, incident periodontal disease was
noted in 23% of the 903 women indicating a continuum
of periodontal disease during pregnancy (9).

Further exploration of 763 women enrolled in the
OCAP study revealed those with severe periodontal
disease or where periodontal disease had progressed and
were significantly more likely to develop pre-eclampsia
adjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.15.3 and OR 2.1, 95% CI
1.04.4, respectively (41). In this same cohort, preterm
birth (preterm adjusted RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.12.3) and
spontaneous or very preterm birth (preterm adjusted RR
2.0, 95% CI 1.23.2) was higher among the women (28.6%)
with moderate to severe periodontal disease than those
with mild (19.0%) or periodontal health (11.2%), where
adjustment was made for age, race, first birth, previous
preterm delivery, smoking during pregnancy, marital
status, food stamps, health insurance, and presence of
chorioamionitis (38).

In contrast, there are a number of studies that do not
support the relationship between maternal periodontal
disease and the delivery of PTLBW infants. As outlined
above, different populations and different parameters
have been used, but better study design has provided

consumption,

evidence that is sufficient to contradict but, at the same
time, suggest that the premise is not straightforward.
For example, Davenport and colleagues demonstrated
that the risk for delivery of a PTLBW infant in a
large population of 747 women where the majority were
Bengali (53%) decreased with increasing pocket depth
(OR 0.78 [95%] CI 0.640.99) having adjusted for
maternal age, ethnicity, maternal education, smoking,
alcohol
infections, and hypertension
during pregnancy. They considered it not necessary to
increase periodontal health to improve pregnancy out-
comes, but thought it was still important to maintain oral
health during pregnancy (30). Bassini and colleagues
examined 304 cases and 611 controls for periodontitis
using attachment
loss and information on perinatal
outcome and general health in Brazil. They reported
periodontitis was not significant for either LBW (OR
0.93, 95% CI 0.63, 1.41) or PTLBW (OR 0.92, 95% CI
0.54, 1.57) and concluded that their results did not
uphold the hypothesis that maternal periodontal disease
and PTLBW were linked (23). A further but small
case control study conducted in Brazil of 116 post-
partum women found that the non-PTLBW controls
had significantly higher periodontal pocket depth 2.5 (sd
0.5) than either of those with LBW and or PTB (42).

Meanwhile with increasing inconsistency between study
results, Mitchell-Lewis and his team reported the birth
outcome in a minority group of young women 60%
African American and 39% Hispanic aged between 16
and 19 years old, after intervention of oral prophylaxis
there were no differences in periodontal status despite
higher levels of B. forsythus and C. rectus in the plaque
samples of PTLBW mothers (44). More recently a multi-
centred randomised blinded control trial of the effects of
non-surgical periodontal
treatment during pregnancy
on gestational age and birthweight has been reported,
where 823 women were randomly selected to either
receive scaling and root planning before 21 weeks or after
delivery. Periodontal
improved periodontal
health, but the risk of preterm delivery (OR 0.93, 95%
CI 0.63, 1.37), birthweight (p0.64), or gestational age
(OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.68, 1.58) was not significantly altered
(45). This same group established that in this population
they did not reduce the systemic markers of inflammation
and concluded not to be associated with infant birth-
weight and gestational age (37).

treatment

Pathogenic response
By sampling dental plaque, high vaginal swab, amniotic
fluid, and chorioamnion tissue from 48 East London
women attending for elective caesarean section at full
term, Bearfield and colleagues detected Streptococcus
species and F. nucleatum in the amniotic fluid using PCR
for the presence of the 16S rRNA gene specific to
eubacteria and not by culture. An association between

microbial DNA and complications during pregnancy
such as previous miscarriage, intrauterine death, neonatal
death, preterm delivery, and premature rupture of
membranes were also noted as an incidental finding (35).
Furthermore the OCAP study demonstrated the detec-
tion of a number of oral microorganisms in 812 women at
two points in their pregnancy;B26 week gestation and
48 hours post-partum using foetal cord and maternal
blood samples to detect the systemic dissemination of oral
bacteria and inflammatory components or products such
as maternal IgG and foetal expression of IgM to 15 oral
pathogens found in the red and orange complexes. These
have been shown as key to the imbalance between the
foetus and the mother resulting in PTB or LBW. For
the same group of mothers, the resulting infection is linked
as a trigger for prematurity as observed in those without
protective red-complex IgG response coupled with foetal
IgM response to orange-complex microorganisms (11).

Boggess and colleagues (36) further examined 640
umbilical cord blood samples to detect cord serum levels
of C-reactive protein, IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, PGE2, and the
presence of foetal IgM antibody against five oral pathogens
(C. rectus, P. micros, P. nigrescens, P. intermedia, and
F. nucleatum). No significant risk for PTB was detected
for oral pathogens alone or specific IgM response, unless a
foetal inflammatory response was found as demonstrated
by IgM and the additional presence of mediators
C-reactive protein OR 5.0 (95% CI 1.9, 16.4), high
8-isoprostane OR 3.7 (95% CI 1.4, 9.3), and high PGE2
OR 3.0 (95% CI 1.1, 8.1) significantly increased the risk of
PTB that persisted when adjusted for race, infant gender,
and presence of labour. All TNF-a strata after adjustment
were found to be significant, underpinning a possible
independent exposure to oral pathogens. Although this is
important, the authors considered the study to be flawed
because the number of useable samples was just over half
of the original sample and therefore results were less
tenable (36).

Dortbudak and colleagues (46) demonstrated a relation-
ship between red and orange complexes and poor
pregnancy outcome but others have not demonstrated
similar relationships (11, 29).

The systemic inflammatory impact of periodontal
disease involves the release from periodontal bacteria
cytokines Il-1, IL-6, TNF-a, and PGE2; transported
via the haematogenous migration of oral bacteria in
periodontal biofilm; and contributed to various maternal
disturbances during pregnancy such as miscarriage,
placental damage, premature birth, and LBW. The
evidence of this effect whether direct,
indirect, or a
culmination of events continues to be debated. DePaoloa
(47) made reference to a ‘silent epidemic of oral disease,’
which implicates periodontal disease and dental caries
having a profound effect on systemic disease including
adverse pregnancy outcomes. This complexity has led to

many workers measuring the effect of risk factors (30, 38,
41, 45), some have argued that once the inflammatory
cascade is activated during pregnancy it is difficult to target
the pathway and prevent a PTB outcome.

The impact of intervention studies on poor
pregnancy outcomes
There are mixed responses to treatment of periodontal
disease during pregnancy that can reduce the chances of
delivery of a preterm or LBW infant. Lopez and his
colleagues, using a randomised control trial to investigate
the effect of periodontal maintenance after 28 weeks
gestation, demonstrated that 8.6% of the women with
gingivitis and treated before 28 weeks gestation and 2.5%
of those healthy and not treated until after delivery
delivered a PTLBW infant (RR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7, 7.3,
p0.0004)
independent of usual risk factors. There
was criticism in terms of selection bias and residual
confounding associated with smoking, which illustrates
problems associated with but not necessarily accounting
for all confounders and taking care with selection (39).
Jeffcoat and colleagues carried out a feasibility study to
determine whether or not treatment of periodontal disease
reduced poor pregnancy outcome in terms of spontaneous
PTB in 366 women with periodontitis between 21 and
25 weeks gestation. The outcome of treatment for period-
ontitis was thought to reduce PTB in a predominantly
African American population but adjunctive metronia-
dazole had no effect. They concluded that a larger trial
would be necessary to achieve statistical significance for a
positive outcome of reducing poor pregnancy outcomes
(43).

Conclusion
The question still remains, are women with periodontal
disease any more at risk of having a poor or adverse
pregnancy outcome than those whose periodontal health
is good? Periodontal disease is an inflammatory process
that occurs in the tissues surrounding the teeth in
response to bacterial accumulations. The inflammatory
response can be detected locally within the periodontal
tissues and at the systemic level, which is not dissimilar to
other inflammatory conditions and includes the process
of parturition where similar ‘inflammatory’ processes
play a part in a good pregnancy outcome with the
delivery of a term infant.

Evidence supports the theory that dental plaque
biofilm with its potential for increased risk of bacteraemia
(infectious burden) and resulting inflammatory response
may adversely affect distant sites and various organ
systems. Therefore, periodontal-derived bacteraemia
may have a role in increasing the risk of systemic disease
and disorders. Periodontal disease can be modified when
the public health impact is, therefore, predicated on public
education for effective daily oral hygiene.

PT-LBW and the role of oral bacteria

Why is this important to understand and devise simple
preventive programmes? Finding a solution is just as
important to clinicians as to mothers and their infants.
The impact of preterm and LBW can be devastating for a
mother and her family. In England and Wales, 7.6 and
1.2% of all live births weigh less than 2,500 g or less than
1,500 g, respectively; in areas of social deprivation those
born with LBW increase to at least 9.3%, 0.5% of births
are stillbirths, and less than 0.5% die within their first
year (28). Additionally, of those babies born between 22
and 25 weeks gestation, half grow up with some form of
neurological abnormality or development disability. The
burden and impact on the children as they grow up, their
families, and the health service is huge and, therefore,
understanding the causes of poor pregnancy outcomes
remains pressing (1).

Some would say as far as oral health care is concerned it
is imperative to ensure that everyone at whatever stage in
their lives brushes their teeth properly to maintain gingival
and periodontal health and be caries free. By doing this,
the risk of poor periodontal health and consequences of
poor pregnancy outcomes may be averted but the evidence
remains conflicting. However, there is probably sufficient
evidence to support the haematagenous translocation
of periodontal pathogens to the foetal-placental unit
associated with a cumulative inflammatory response.
This periodontal inflammatory response may well be the
final straw and result in an adverse pregnancy outcome. It
remains important to recognise the need for improvement
in oral health during pregnancy, for the maintenance of
good general health, and to provide the necessary
mechanism promotion of the same.
