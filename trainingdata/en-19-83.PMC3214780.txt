ABSTRACT

Nitric  oxide  (NO)  regulates  proliferation,  differentiation  and  survival  of  neurons. 
Although  NO  is  reported  to  involve  in  NGF-induced  differentiation  of  PC12  cells,  the 
role  of  NO  has  not  been  characterized 
in  primary  neuron  cells.  Therefore,  we 
investigated  the  role  of  NO  in  neuronal  differentiation  of  primary  cortical  neuron  cells. 
Primary  cortical  neuron  cells  were  prepared  from  rat  embryos  of  embryonic  day  18  and 
treated  with  NMMA  (NOS  inhibitor)  or  PTIO  (NO  scavenger).  Neurite  outgrowth  of 
neuron  cells  was  counted  and  the  mRNA  levels  of  p21,  p27,  c-jun  and  c-myc  were 
measured  by  RT-PCR.  Neurite  outgrowth  of  primary  cortical  neuron  cells  was  inhibited 
a  little  by  NOS  inhibitor  and  completely  by  NO  scavenger.  The  mRNA  levels  of  p21 
and  p27,  differentiation-induced  growth  arrest  genes  were  increased  during  differ-
entiation,  but  they  were  decreased  by  NOS  inhibitor  or  NO  scavenger.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  level  of  c-jun  mRNA  was  not  changed  and  the  level  of  c-myc  mRNA  was 
increased  during  differentiation  differently  from  previously  reported.  The  levels  of  these 
mRNA  were  reversed  in  NOS  inhibitor-  or  NO  scavenger-treated  cells.  The  level  of 
nNOS  protein  was  not  changed  but  NOS  activity  was  inhibited  largely  by  NOS  inhibitor 
or  NO  scavenger.  These  results  suggest  that  NO  is  an  essential  mediator  for  neuronal 
differentiation  of  primary  cortical  neuron  cells.

INTRODUCTION

    Nitric  oxide  (NO),  a  diffusible  and  unstable  gas, 
regulates  proliferation,  survival  and  differentiation  of 
neurons.  NO  is  also  known  to  involve  in  synaptic 
activity,  neural  plasticity,  memory  function,  neuro-
inflammation  and  neurodegeneration  (Calabrese  et 
al.,  2009).  NO  is  synthesized  from  citrulline  and 
L-arginine  by  nitric  oxide  synthases  (NOS)  (Mayer 
and  Hemmens,  1997).  Three  forms  of  NOS  have 
been  reported.  A  neuronal  type  (nNOS)  was  dis-
covered  originally  in  neurons,  an  endothelial  type 
(eNOS)  was  expressed  mainly  in  endothelial  cells, 
and  an  inducible  form  (iNOS)  was  purified  from  rat 
and  porcine  cerebellum  (Orlando  et  al.,  2008). 
    It  has  been  reported  that  cytostatic  effect  of  NGF 
is  mediated  by  NO  during  differentiation  of  PC12 
cells  (Peunova  and  Enikolopov,  1995).  In  addition, 
neuronal  NO  synthase  and  nitric  oxide  are  required 
for  NGF-induced  differentiation  of  PC12  cells 
(Phung  et  al.,  1999).  But  little  is  known  about  effect 
of  NO  during  differentiation  of  primary  neuron  cells. 
Therefore,  we  examined 
the  effect  of  NO  on 
differentiation  of  rat  primary  cortical  neuron  cells  by 
using  NMMA,  a  competitive  inhibitor  of  all  three 
isoforms  of  NOS,  and  PTIO,  a  scavenger  of  NO. 
Here,  we  showed  that  neurite  outgrowth  of  primary 
cortical  neuron  cells  was  inhibited  via  regulation  of 
differentiation-related  genes  by  depletion  of  NO.

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

Cell  culture

    Primary  cortical  neuron  cells  were  established  by 
a  modification  of  previously  described  procedure 
(Kim  et  al.,  2007).  The  cortices  from  rat  embryos  of 
embryonic  day  18  were  dissected  and  freed  of 
meninges.  The  cells  were  dissociated  by  trypsin, 
followed  by  trituration.  The  cortical  cells  were  plated 
onto  poly-D-lysine-coated  35  mm  culture  dishes 
containing  DMEM  with  5%  fetal  bovine  serum  and 
5%  horse  serum  at  5%  CO2  and  37oC.  After  48  h, 
cytosine  arabinoside  (10μM)  was  added  to  the 
media  to  inhibit  the  growth  of  non-neuronal  cells. 
The  cortical  cells  were  cultured  up  to  9  days.

Measurement  of  neurite  outgrowth

    Primary  cortical  neuron  cells  were  seeded  in 

poly-D-lysine-coated  35  mm  dishes  at  a  density  of 
1×106  cells/dish  and  incubated  in  complete  medium 
for  12  h.  And  then  neuron  cells  were  treated  with 
or  without  6  mM  NMMA  or  1  mM  PTIO  for  5  days. 
Neurite  formation  was  measured  by  marking  at  3 
sites  of  each  dish  and  counting  a  minimum  of  100 
cells  under  the  microscope. 

RNA  extraction,  Reverse  Transcription-Polymer-
ase  Chain  Reaction  (RT-PCR)

    Total  RNA  was  extracted  from  cells  using  RNAzol 
B  as  described  in  manufacturer’  instruction  (TEL- 
TEST,  INC.,  Friendswood,  Texas,  USA)  and  used 
directly  for  the  first-strand  cDNA  synthesis.  The 
primers  used  for  PCR  are  as  follows:  5’-AGT- 
ATG-CCG-TCG-TCT-GTT-CG-3'  (p21  sense),  5'-GAG- 
TGC-AAG-ACA-GCG-ACA-AG-3'  (p21  anti-sense): 
5'-GAG-GGC-AGA-TAC-GAA-TGG-CAG-3'  (p27  sen-
se),  5'-CTG-GAC-ACT-GCT-CCG-CTA-ACC-3'  (p27 
anti-sense):  5'-CTG-CAA-CAT-CCC-CAA-TGA-CC-3' 
(c-fos  sense),  5'-AGG-TCC-ACA-TCT-GGC-ACA-GA- 
3'  (c-fos  anti-sense):  5'-GCT-TCT-CTA-GTG-CTC- 
CGT-AA-3'  (c-jun  sense),  5'-TCT-AGG-AGT-CGT- 
CAG-AAT-CC-3'  (c-jun  anti-sense):  5'-AAC-TTA-CAA- 
TCT-GCG-AGC-CA-3'  (c-myc  sense),  5'-AGC-AGC 
-TCG-AAT-TTC-TTC-CAG-ATA-T-3'  (c-myc  anti-sen-
se).  PCR  was  performed  as  follows:  95oC  for  8 
min,  followed  by  40  cycles  of  95oC  for  1  min, 
annealing  temperature  [GAPDH  (61oC),  p21  (52oC), 
(52oC),  c-myc 
p27 
(60oC)]  for  1  min,  72oC  for  2  min.  After  the  last 
cycle,  the  final  elongation  was  performed  at  72oC 
for  10  min.  PCR  product  was  analyzed  by  gel 
electrophoresis.  The  sizes  of  PCR  products  for  the 
various  genes  are  495  bp  (GAPDH),  311  bp  (p21), 
238  bp  (p27),  272  bp  (c-fos),  775  bp  (c-jun),  342 
bp  (c-myc),  respectively.

Immunohistochemical  staining

    Cells  were  fixed  by  4%  paraformaldehyde  in  0.1 
M  phosphate  buffer  (pH  7.4)  and  incubated  at  room 
temperature  for  25  min.  Cells  were  incubated  with 
anti-nNOS  antibody  at  4oC  overnight.  Secondary 
antibody  (biotin-conjugated  anti-mouse  IgG  rabbit 
serum)  was  added  and  incubated  for  2  h.  And  then 
horseradish  peroxidase-conjugated  Steptavidin  was 
added  and  incubated  for  2  h.  After  washing  with 
0.1  M  phosphate  buffer  (pH  7.4),  0.05%  dia-

minobenzidine  solution  was  added  and  incubated 
for  1  min.  Brown  color-stained  cells  were  observed 
and  photographed  at  400  times  magnification  under 
phase  contrast  and  bright-field  microscope.

Determination  of  NOS  activity 

    Cells  were  homogenized  in  20  mM  HEPES  buffer 
(pH  7.2)  containing  0.32  M  sucrose,  0.5  mM  EDTA, 
1  mM  DTT,  1  mM  PMSF,  10  mg/l  leupeptin,  10 
mg/l  aprotinin.  For  the  [3H-arginine-citrulline]  con-
version  assay,  1μCi  of  [3H-arginine]  was  incubated 
with  20μg  of  cell  extracts  in  50  mM  HEPES  buffer 
(pH  7.5)  containing  0.45  mM  CaCl2,  2  mM  NADPH, 
500μM  arginine,  10μg/ml  calmodulin,  at  37oC  for 
30  min  as  described  previously  (Bredt  and  Snyder, 
1990;  Peunova  and  Enikolopov,  1995).  Assays  were 
terminated  by  addition  of  2  ml  of  ice  cold  20  mM 
HEPES  buffer  (pH  5.5)  containing  2  mM  EDTA  and 
reaction  mixtures  were  applied  to  1  ml  columns  of 
Dowex  AG  50WX-8  (Na＋  form),  which  were  pre-elut-
ed  with  2  ml  of  distilled  water.  Citrulline  was  sepa-
rated  from  arginine  on  Dowex  AG  50  columns  and 
the  radioactivity  in  the  flow-through  (citrulline-  cotain-
ing  fraction)  was  determined.  Control  determinations 
of  the  enzyme  activity  were  done  in  the  presence  of 
20μl  of  heat-treated  extract,  or  in  the  absence  of 
NADPH.  [3H]-citrulline  in  4  ml  flow-through  was 
quantified  by  using  the  scintillation  counter. 

RESULTS

Neurite  outgrowth  of  rat  primary  cortical  neu-
ron  cells  was  inhibited  slightly  by  NMMA  (NOS 
inhibitor)  and  completely  by  PTIO  (NO  scaven-
ger)

    To  investigate  the  effect  of  NO  on  neurite  out-
growth  of  rat  primary  cortical  neuron  cells,  NMMA, 
a  NOS  inhibitor  or  PTIO,  a  NO  scavenger  was 
treated  and  the  neurite  outgrowth  was  measured. 
Maximum  concentration  of  NMMA  or  PTIO  that 
does  not  result  in  cell  death  of  rat  primary  cortical 
neuron  cells  was  determined  and  used  for  treat-
ment.  In  untreated  neuron  cells,  neurite  outgrowth 
was  formed  in  about  80%  of  neuron  cells  within  2 
days  and  in  all  neuron  cells  in  5  days.  There  is  no 
change  in  neurite  outgrowth  of  neuron  cells  treated 
with  1  mM  or  3  mM  NMMA  (data  not  shown).  Slight 
reduction  was  observed  in  6  mM  NMMA  treatment.

However,  the  neurite  outgrowth  of  6  mM  NMMA- 
treated  cells  was  also  completed  in  5  days  as  in 
untreated  cells.  On  the  other  hand,  neurite  out-
growth  of  primary  cortical  neuron  cells  was  inhibited 
completely  by  treatment  of  1  mM  PTIO  (Fig.  1).

levels  of  p21  and  p27  mRNA  were  measured  by

gradually  increased  from  1.5  to  7  days  during  neuro-
nal  differentiation  (Fig.  2A).  The  level  of  p21  mRNA 
was  gradually  increased  from  2  to  7  days  in  6  mM 
NMMA-treated  cells  but  the  level  was  reduced  con-
siderably  when  compared  to  untreated  cells.  The 
level  of  p21  mRNA  maintained  without  change  from 
0.5  to  7  days  in  1  mM  PTIO-treated  cells.  On  the 
other  hand,  the  level  of  p27  mRNA  was  gradually 
increased  from  0.5  to  7  days  as  seen  in  p21  (Fig. 
2B)  during  neuronal  differentiation.  But  the  level  of 
p27  mRNA  was  not  changed  in  6  mM  NMMA  or  1 
mM  PTIO-treated  cells.  The  level  of  p27  mRNA  in  1 

mM  PTIO-treated  cells  was  interestingly  much  lower 
than  untreated  cells.  These  results  show  that  the 
levels  of  p27  and  p21  mRNAs  were  increased 
during  neurite  outgrowth  in  primary  cortical  neuron 
cells.  Differentition-induced  change  in  their  mRNA 
levels  was  inhibited  by  NMMA  and  PTIO.

is 

involved 

    Because  NO 
in  differentiation  of 
primary  cortical  neuron  cells  (Fig.  1),  we  measured 
total  NOS  activity  during  differentiation.  NOS  activity 
was  increased  during  differentiation  of  untreated 
primary  cortical  neuron  cells.  However,  NOS  activity 
was  inhibited  in  NMMA-treated  cells  and  largely 
inhibited  in  PTIO-treated  cells  (Fig.  5).  These  re-
sults  show  that  total  NOS  activity  was  increased 
during  differentiation  of  primary  cortical  neuron  cells 
but  was  inhibited  by  NMMA  or  PTIO  as  expected. 

DISCUSSION

    Several  reports  suggested  that  NGF-induced  neu-
rite  outgrowth  of  PC12  cells  were  inhibited  by  NO 
scavengers  and  NOS  inhibitors.  The  chronic  in-
hibition  of  NOS  increases  cell  proliferation  in  den-
tate  gyrus  (Park  et  al.,  2003)  and  nNOS-derived 
NO  suppresses  neurogenesis  in  adult  dentate  gyrus 
(Zhu  et  al.,  2006).  However,  since  PC12  cells  were 
not  neuronal  origin,  the  role  of  NO  in  neuronal 
in  primary 
differentiation  should  be 
neuronal  cells.  We  demonstrated 
that  NO  sca-
venger  and  NOS  inhibitor  inhibit  neurite  outgrowth 
in  rat  primary  cortical  neuron  cells  (Fig.  1).  NO 
turned  also  out  to  be  an  important  mediator  of 
neuronal  differentiation  in  primary  cortical  neuron

and  c-myc  mRNAs  were  measured  by  RT-PCR. 
The  level  of  c-jun  mRNA  was  not  changed  during 
differentiation  in  neuron  cells  (Fig.  3A).  But  it  was 
gradually  increased  in  6  mM  NMMA  treated-cells  or 
in  the  1  mM  PTIO  treated-cells.  On  the  other  hand, 
the  level  of  c-myc  mRNA  was  gradually  increased 
during  differentiation  in  cortical  neuron  cells,  but 
was  not  changed  in  6  mM  NMMA  or  1  mM  PTIO 
treated-cells  (Fig.  3B).

The  expression  level  of  neuronal  NOS  (nNOS) 
protein  is  not  apparently  related  with  neuronal 
differentiation  of  rat  primary  cortical  neuron 
cells

    Because  nNOS  is  expressed  in  neurons  and  is 
possibly  related  with  neurite  outgrowth,  we  analyzed 
the  level  of  nNOS  protein  by  immunostaining  using 
anti-nNOS  antibody.  The  level  of  nNOS  protein  was 
not  changed  considerably 
in  NMMA-  or  PTIO- 
treated  cells  (Fig.  4).  These  results  show  that  the 
expression  level  of  nNOS  protein  is  not  apparently 
related  with  neuronal  differentiation  of  the  primary 
cortical  neuron  cells.

cells  as  well  as  PC12  cells.   
    Since  growth  arrest  is  a  prerequisite  of  neuronal 
differentiation,  expression  levels  of  growth-related 
genes  were  tested  during  differentiation  of  primary 
cortical  neuron  cells.  Several  reports  demonstrated 
that  p21  expression  was  involved  in  neurite  out-
growth.  NGF  increases  p21  and  cyclin  D1  for  growth 
arrest  during  NGF-induced  neurite  outgrowth  of 
PC12  cells  (Yan  and  Ziff,  1995;  Yan  and  Ziff, 
1997).  It  was  also  reported  that  NGF  induces  NOS 
and  the  resulting  synthesized-NO  acts  as  a  second 
messenger.  NGF-induced  NO  increases  p21  during 
NGF-induced  neuronal  differentiation  of  PC12  cells. 
By  using  p21  inducible  system,  induction  of  p21 
restored  neurite  extension  (Poluha  et  al.,  1997).  On 
the  other  hand,  cell  cycle  arrest  and  differentiation 
were  induced  in  neuroblastoma  cells  by  retinoic 
acid  (RA).  Two  sublines  of  SK-N-SH,  SK-N  and 
SH-F  displayed  strikingly  different  responses  to  RA. 
SK-N  was  induced  to  neuronal  differentiation  by  RA 
but  SH-F  was  transformed  from  the  small  neu-
roblastic  cells  into  large,  flattened,  epithelium-like 
cells  by  RA  (Wainwright  et  al.,  2001).  RA  induces 
high  expression  of  cyclin  D1  and  accumulation  of 
p21  in  SH-N  cells.  But  in  SH-F,  RA  induces  el-
evation  of  p18,  down-regulation  of  cyclin  D1,  and 
swift  inhibition  of  cyclin  D-dependent  kinases  (cdks). 
Overexpression  of  p21  also  induces  neural  dif-
ferentiation  in  RA  untreated  neuroblastoma  cells 
(Wainwright  et  al.,  2001).  During  differentiation  of 
rat  primary  cortical  neuron  cells  in  our  work,  p21 
mRNA  was  also  increased  (Fig.  2A).  The  level  of 
p21  mRNA  was  decreased  in  NMMA-treated  cells 
but  unchanged  in  PTIO-treated  cells  as  expected. 
    p27 
is  involved  in  cell  cycle  arrest  and  dif-
ferentiation  in  neuroblastoma  cells  (Perez-Juste  and 
Aranda,  1999)  and  embryonal  carcinoma  cells 
(Baldassarre  et  al.,  2000).  p27  is  accumulated  in 
proliferating  neuroblastoma  N2A  cells,  and  is  de-
graded  for  triggering  differentiation  and  re-synthesis 
of  active  p27  occurs  between  24  and  48  h  after 
treatment  of  cAMP  (Munoz  et  al.,  2003).  During 
differentiation  of  primary  cortical  neuron  cells,  the 
level  of  p27mRNA  was  increased  in  our  work  (Fig. 
2B).  The  level  of  p27  mRNA  was  not  changed 
during  differentiation  and  was  much 
in 
NMMA-  or  PTIO-treated  cells  when  compared  to 
untreated  cells.

    Early  inducible  genes  such  as  c-fos,  jun-B,  zif/ 
268,  and  c-jun,  were  induced  transiently  by  stimu-
lation  of  glutamate  receptors  in  primary  cultures  of 
rat  cerebellar  neurons  (Szekely  et  al.,  1990).  Immedi-
ately  early  genes  were  also  expressed  in  differen-
tiated  neurons  by  cyclic  AMP  (Vaccarino  et  al.,  1993). 
c-jun  expression  and  phosphorylation  were  induced 
in  various  conditions  (Raivich  and  Behrens,  2006) 
including  neuronal  differentiation  and  survival 
in 
PC12  cells  (Dragunow  et  al.,  2000)  and  neuronal 
and  non-neuronal  cell  death  (Dragunow  and  Pres-
ton,  1995).  However,  the  level  of  c-jun  mRNA  was 
not  changed  during  differentiation  of  primary  cortical 
neurons  in  our  work  (Fig.  3A),  indicating  that  c-jun 
may  not  be  associated  with  neuronal  differentiation 
of  primary  cortical  neuron  cells.  On  the  other  hand, 
the  level  of  c-myc  mRNA  was  gradually  increased 
in  untreated  cells  but  was  not  changed  in  NMMA- 
or  PTIO-treated  cells  (Fig.  3B).  Since  high  ex-
pression  of  c-myc  was  known  to  be  related  with 
prevention  of  differentiation  (Henriksson  and  Lus-
cher,  1996),  c-myc  may  have  a  specific  role  during 
neuronal  differentiation  of  rat  primary  cortical  neu-
rons,  although  we  do  not  have  further  evidence. 
    NO  produced  by  nNOS  reduced  brain  neuro-
genesis  as  antiproliferative  molecule  (Matarredona 
et  al.,  2004;  Moreno-Lopez  et  al.,  2004).  However, 
NO  produced  by  iNOS  and  eNOS  stimulate  brain 
neurogenesis  (Zhang  et  al.,  2001;  Zhu  et  al.,  2003; 
Reif  et  al.,  2004).  The  level  of  nNOS  protein  was 
not  changed  in  NMMA-  or  PTIO-treated  cells  in  our 
work  (Fig.  4).  iNOS  and  eNOS  but  not  nNOS  seem 
to  be  involved  in  stimulation  of  neuronal  differ-
entiation.  Total  NOS  activity  was  increased  during 
differentiation  of  primary  cortical  neuron  cells  and 
was  inhibited  in  NMMA-  or  PTIO-treated  cells  (Fig. 
5), 
for 
neuronal  differentiation  in  primary  cortical  neuron 
cells.  The  level  of  NO  and  NOS  activity  appear  to 
play  key  roles  in  mediating  neuronal  differentiation 
of  primary  cortical  neuron  cells.  Our  result  also 
suggests  that  NO  and  NOS  activity  appear  to  play 
key  roles  in  mediating  neuronal  differentiation  of 
brain  cortical  neuron.
