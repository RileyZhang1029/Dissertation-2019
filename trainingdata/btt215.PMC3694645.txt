Efforts such as the 1000 Genomes Project further add to the availability of human genome variation data.
However, to date, there is no method that can map reads of a newly sequenced human genome to a large collection of genomes.
Instead, methods rely on aligning reads to a single reference genome.
This leads to inherent biases and lower accuracy.
To tackle this prob- lem, a new alignment tool BWBBLE is introduced in this article.
We (i) introduce a new compressed representation of a collection of gen- omes, which explicitly tackles the genomic variation observed at every position, and (ii) design a new alignment algorithm based on the Burrows Wheeler transform that maps short reads from a newly sequenced genome to an arbitrary collection of two or more (up to millions of) genomes with high accuracy and no inherent bias to one specific genome.

Several large-scale sequencing efforts are under way, including the 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010) and the International Cancer Genome Project (International Cancer Genome Consortium, 2013).
More than 2000 individuals have already been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project.
Although the next-generation sequencing technologies provide a vast amount of data samples for advancing genomic research, the ever- increasing volume of genomic data has become a tremendous challenge on multiple fronts (Durbin, 2009  Fritz et al., 2011  Kozanitis et al., 2010).
One challenge is the alignment of the short DNA sequences (short reads) produced by these technol- ogies to reference genomes, to discover the variation of a newly sequenced genome with respect to the previously sequenced human genomes.
Short read alignment is a common first step during genomic data analysis and plays a critical role in medical and population genetics.
Several efficient short-read alignment programs, such as BWA, SOAP2 and Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009b  Li and Durbin, 2009  Li et al., 2009), have been developed in the past years (Li and Homer, 2010).
These methods use the Burrows  Wheeler transform (BWT) (Burrows and Wheeler, 1994), which facilitates linear-time alignment to a large reference string  *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(Ferragina and Manzini, 2000), such as a genome, and requires only a limited amount of memory (Hon et al., 2007  Nong et al., 2011).
These aligners typically precalculate the BWT (and some associated auxiliary structures) of a single reference genome and then map the newly sequenced reads to it using a variant of the BWT backwards search procedure.
Any observed differences from the chosen reference genome are treated as novel genomic variants or sequencing errors (e.g.
Li and Durbin, 2009).
In light of the increasing availability of thousands of sequenced human genomes and databases of human genome variation, the require- ment of these methods to use a single human reference genome leads to inherent biases towards the arbitrarily chosen reference.
Biased alignment output can be a hindrance to the in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the cancer genome (Lee et al., 2010  Roach et al., 2010), evolutionary history (Kumar et al., 2004), Mendelian diseases (Ng et al., 2010) and numerous other domain applications.
Beyond human, to date, millions of genomic variants have been observed in a wide variety of species and can serve as a valuable resource for alignment.
For example, many inbred mouse strains have been sequenced to characterize their genomic variation (Keane et al., 2011).
Two such mouse strains can have up to 20 million differences between them.
As a result, when they are crossed, their F1 offspring are heterozygous at all loci that differ between the parents.
Aligning reads from the F1 offspring to either parent s genome using current alignment techniques will ignore this known heterozygosity and result in alignment bias towards the chosen reference strain.
This can make it difficult to perform an experiment like RNA-seq, which relies on high quality mappings.
The limitations of using conventional references and aligners are even more pronounced when sequencing organisms with a large amount of genomic variation among individuals.
For ex- ample, the sea squirt, Ciona savignyi, has a polymorphism rate of  4.5% (Rumble et al., 2009).
With such a high polymorphism rate, the genome of any newly sequenced individual of this spe- cies will be very different from a single conventional reference sequence.
Current short-read aligners operating on a single ref- erence genome are simply not designed to handle this scenario and will result in poor alignment accuracy.
Although humans have a lower polymorphism rate, the refer- ence bias remains an important problem.
Even though individual alignment results may be only slightly biased when aligning with conventional techniques, in a large study involving thousands of individuals, the study s conclusion.
this effect can add up to distort  A vast number of genomic variants in human populations have already been discovered and are maintained in publicly ac- cessible databases, such as dbSNP and SNPedia.
The majority of variations between a newly sequenced genome and the reference are likely to already exist in these databases.
Moreover, struc- tural variants, such as transpositions, large insertions and  ÃŸ The Author 2013.

deletions and inversions, are difficult to analyse and require split- read alignment techniques (Pang et al., 2010  Snyder et al., 2010).
Once a structural variant is detected, it would be desirable to avoid repeating the process of identifying the same variant in other genomes.
With this issue in mind, we are facing the chal- lenging problem of how to efficiently incorporate the available genomic variant information during alignment.
The naive solution to this problem is to use the existing fast aligners to map new read samples to all available genomes indi- vidually.
The state-of-the-art aligners, albeit much faster than their predecessors, still take 3 5 h to map 12.2 million reads to a human genome on a single core processor (Li and Durbin, 2009), so spending 2000  more time (roughly a year) to map those reads to all the genomes currently in the 1000 Genomes Project is not a realistic solution, especially as this time will scale linearly with the number of genomes in the collection.
Furthermore, even though the space required to store the BWT-related data structures of each genome can be significantly reduced using various compression techniques (Hon et al., 2007), the total amount of space required for storing all the available genome data is considerable.
Finally, this solution does not take into account the scenario where the newly sequenced genome has a novel haplotype of several nearby SNPs (i.e.
when the newly sequenced genome contains a combination of SNPs that do not occur together in any known genome individually).
An alternative solution is to align the newly sequenced reads to a single reference genome and then query the genomic variation databases to analyze the mismatches.
This approach is used in programs such as Crossbow (Langmead et al., 2009a), VarScan (Koboldt et al., 2009), and others (Handsaker et al., 2011  Mokry et al., 2010).
However, if the reads are misaligned during the first step (e.g.
reads spanning a mutation), incorrect mismatch loca- tions will be propagated to the second step, which can bias the study results and lead to questionable conclusions, especially for a large study involving thousands of genomes (DePristo et al., 2011).
Taking advantage of the high redundancy among sequenced genomes, several techniques have been proposed for compressing genomic data and searching this compressed data directly (Lam et al., 2010  Loh et al., 2012  Makinen et al., 2009  Schneeberger et al., 2009  Siren et al., 2011).
Loh et al.
(2012) provides the first efficient scheme for compressing genomic libraries and presents compression-accelerated BLAST and BLAT algorithms that search over the compressed data.
In particular, their data com- pression scheme consists of finding fragments (by default, 300 bp long) in the database that are highly similar, keeping only one version of the sequence fragment, and replacing each additional fragment with a link to this sequence and a list of differences.
The first approach for mapping short reads against a collec- tion of genomes simultaneously is presented by Schneeberger et al.
(2009).
Their algorithm, GenomeMapper, combines the genomes into a joint hash-based graph data structure.
More spe- cifically, it builds an index of all available reference genomes that maps sequence k-mers (5 13 bp long) to their positions in the genomes.
Identical regions are stored only once, and poly- morphic regions are stored separately for each genome (these are represented as branches in the index).
During alignment, the hash-based index is first scanned to identify the exact matches, then nearly identical maximal substrings are detected,  i362  and finally, bounded dynamic programming is used to extend the partial alignments.
Although this technique proved to be success- ful for aligning with the small Arabidopsis Col-0 genome, its high memory requirement makes its applicability to a human genome still questionable (Li and Homer, 2010).
Siren et al.
(2011) proposed a novel index structure for a col- lection of genomes built by converting the genome multiple alignment into a prefix-sorted finite automaton that can recog- nize the strings corresponding to all the paths through the mul- tiple alignment.
This work generalizes the BWT-based index structure for labelled trees to labelled graphs and uses a modifi- cation of the backwards search algorithm to perform read map- ping.
The technique was demonstrated on the multiple alignment of four assemblies of the human chromosome 18 and is expected to support genomes of up to 100 Mbp using a single workstation.
Owing to its high memory consumption during prefix-sorted au- tomaton construction, an external memory implementation is needed to index a collection of human genomes, which is not yet available.
Therefore, the applicability of this method to a large collections of human genomes has not yet been demon- strated in practice.
In this article, we present BWBBLE, an aligner that handles genetic variants and thus avoids the inherent bias induced by mapping to a specific genome, while providing reasonable com- putation time and limited memory consumption for large collec- tions of genomes.
The main new contributions of our work are the following: (i) we introduce the concept of a linear reference multi-genome that incorporates the catalogue of all known gen- omic variants with a reference genome (e.g.
SNPs, insertions, deletions and inversions), and (ii) we develop a BWT-based read alignment algorithm, BWBBLE, that accurately maps reads to this multi-genome.
We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of BWBBLE in Section 4 with a set of experiments using simulated and real read data.
2 BACKGROUND: BURROWS WHEELER  TRANSFORM  The BWT (Burrows and Wheeler, 1994) of a given string is a reversible permutation of the string symbols that enables the search for a pattern P in the original string to take OÃ°jPjÃž time (i.e.
linear time with respect to the length of the pattern).
Let S Â¼ s0s1::: sn 1 be a string of length n defined over some alphabet   (e.g.
the A/C/G/T nucleotide alphabet if S is a genome) and let $ be a symbol not in   that is lexicographically smaller than all the characters of  .
When constructing the BWT of S, $ is first appended at the end of S, such that S Â¼ s0s1:::sn, where sn Â¼ $ (now jSj Â¼ n Ã¾ 1).
Let SA be the suffix array of S (we have jSAj Â¼ jSj), such that SAÂ½i  stores the position of the i- th lexicographically smallest suffix of S (e.g.
SAÂ½0  Â¼ n since $ is the smallest suffix).
A simple technique for constructing the BWT and SA is demonstrated in Figure 1.
It can be shown that BWTÂ½i  Â¼ SÂ½SAÂ½i    1  when SAÂ½i  6Â¼ 0 (and $ otherwise).
If a pattern P does occur in S, then each of its occurrences will appear at the start of some suffix of S, and these suffixes will be grouped together into a single suffix array interval SAÂ½LÃ°PÃž, UÃ°PÃž , where LÃ°PÃž and UÃ°PÃž represent the indices of the lexicographically smallest and largest suffix starting with P,   Short read alignment with populations of genomes  character of the reference.
For example, read base A can match the IUPAC characters A, D, H, M, N, R, V and W. Therefore, the substrings that a read can map to in the reference might be grouped into multiple separate SA intervals.
In particu- lar, if the suffixes are sorted in IUPAC lexicographic order (Fig.
2), then the substrings matching A can fall into up to five separate SA intervals: suffixes starting with A, D, H, [M N R], and [V W] can be separated by suffixes starting with [B C], G, K, and [S T], respectively.
To minimize the number of separate SA intervals associated with each of the four nucleotides, we propose to use the four-bit Gray code (also known as the reflected binary code) (Gray, 1953) to order the IUPAC characters (instead of ordering them lexico- graphically).
The four-bit Gray code orders four-bit binary values such that two successive values differ by only one bit.
For this purpose, we encode each IUPAC character using four bits, such that each bit corresponds to a given nucleotide and is set to 1 if the IUPAC character matches this nucleotide and 0 otherwise.
For example, given the nucleotide-to-bit assignment bAbCbGbT, the Gray code value of 1001 corresponds to the IUPAC character W that represents both A and T. Figure 3 shows the IUPAC character order resulting from using this nu- cleotide-to-bit assignment.
We can see that given this new order- ing, the IUPAC characters matching A will all fall into a single SA interval (as they are now ordered consecutively).
The number of SA intervals per nucleotide will be the following: A !
1 interval, C !
1 interval, G !
2 intervals, T !
4 intervals.
Because A and T occur more frequently in the human genome, we expect the nucleotide-to-bit assignment bAbTbCbG to result in better performance.
The nucleotide-to-bit assignment can be easily adapted to a specific genome during indexing to prioritize the more frequent nucleotides (e.g.
bGbCbAbT should be used for prokaryotes with a high GC content).
It can be theoretically shown that the Gray code order is the optimal order for this problem (see Appendix).
Figure 4 shows an example of con- structing the BWT and SA of a toy multi-genome using the Gray code order.
3.1.2 Extension to other genomic variations In addition to SNPs, other types of genomic variations are common within and across populations.
Such variations include insertions, dele- tions, inversions and translocations.
If we superimpose the genomes of a given collection, we can collapse the matching nucleotides and encode SNPs with IUPAC characters (as described in Section 3.1.1).
The remaining varying- length segments (caused by other types of genomic variations) will visually form a set of bubbles composed of multiple branches, where each branch represents a variant of the genome sequence that was observed at that position in at least one of the genomes in the collection.
Figure 5 shows the result of superimposing three sample genomes where the SNPs have been encoded with M and K and the indels form a bubble with three branches.
We incorporate the indels into the reference multi-genome as follows.
One of the bubble branches is designated as the primary branch and included into the reference at the position at which the bubble occurs.
All other bubble branches are appended at the end of the reference genome.
Each appended branch is padded at both ends with the bases surrounding the bubble.
The length of the padding is a parameter that depends on the expected read  i363  Fig.

BWT and SA construction for SÂ¼ mamaliga$.
All the rotations of S are first listed (1) and then sorted in lexicographic order (2).
The BWT string is assembled from the last character of each sorted rotation (i.e.
the right-most column of the sorted rotations matrix) and the suffix array SA is given by the original position in S of the suffix at the start of each sorted rotation (the substring preceding $ in each rotation)  UÃ° PÃž Â¼ CÃ° Ãž Ã¾ OÃ° , UÃ°PÃžÃž  LÃ° PÃž Â¼ CÃ° Ãž Ã¾ OÃ° , LÃ°PÃž   1Ãž Ã¾ 1  respectively.
Given the SA interval Â½LÃ°PÃž, UÃ°PÃž , the positions of P in S can be obtained from the corresponding SA values, namely, P will occur in S at all SAÂ½i , for LÃ°PÃž   i   UÃ°PÃž.
Ferragina and Manzini (2000) showed that if P occurs in S, then: Ã°1Ãž Ã°2Ãž where CÃ° Ãž is the number of symbols in S (not counting $) that are lexicographically smaller than  , and OÃ° , iÃž is the number of occurrences of   in BWTÂ½0, i .
Therefore, to find the SA interval of P, we can start with the SA interval of an empty string (LÃ° Ãž Â¼ 0, UÃ° Ãž Â¼ n) and add a character of P at a time in reverse order (i.e.
starting with the last character of P).
Assuming that the C and O arrays have been pre-computed, this technique, known as backwards search, enables us to find the interval of all the occurrences of P in S in OÃ°jPjÃž time.
3 MULTI-GENOME ALIGNMENT  3.1 Reference multi-genome  In this section, we describe how a single reference genome can be augmented with genomic variant information gathered from an arbitrary collection of genomes.
We refer to the augmented ref- erence as the reference multi-genome.
We start by handling SNPs and then refine the proposed reference representation with all other possible variations (e.g.
insertions, deletions, inversions).
3.1.1 SNPs To handle SNPs during alignment, we extend the reference genome alphabet from the 4-letter A/C/T/G nucleotide code to the 16-letter IUPAC nucleotide code (Cornish-Bowden, 1985).
The IUPAC encoding makes it possible to capture which nucleotides have been observed at a given position across all the available sequenced genomes.
For example, if both A and G were discovered at some given position, then the IUPAC char- acter R can be used to represent this variation.
For convenience, in our IUPAC alphabet, we have replaced the IUPAC character U by the special character # that represents the absence of the four nucleotides.
As a result, when aligning a read to the reference multi- genome, a given read nucleotide can match more than one   L.Huang et al.

The reference multi-genome augmented with indel information for the example in Figure 5 is shown in Figure 6 for reads of length jRj Â¼ 4 (padding of length three).
The special character # separates the reference se- quence and the bubble branches to prevent reads from being aligned across the sequence and bubble branch boundaries.
In the case of inversions, translocations and duplications, we can optionally avoid having the bubble branch length increase linearly with the size of the event, jEj, as follows.
We create two branches for the two ends of the structural event of length 2 Ã°jRj   1Ãž centred around the two event boundaries.
Reads that span across the original and the variant sequence boundaries will now map to these two branches.
We do not include the event Â½jRj,jEj   jRj , which is already present in sequence interval either the forward or the reverse complement strand of the ref- erence genome (depending on the type of the structural event).
While saving space, the downside of this approach is the fact that  i364  Fig.

Reference multi-genome with various variations.
Branch padding corresponds to reads of length jRj Â¼ 4  reads from the original and the duplicate sequences will be mapped to the original sequence only, which complicates the assessment of the quality of the read mappings (e.g.
a read should not be considered confidently mapped if it maps equally well to multiple positions), and other techniques have to be used to detect duplicated regions.
These structural events were not included in our experiments, as they are not present in the Integrated Variant Set release (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010) we used to construct the reference multi- genome.
Note that although augmenting the reference with indels and other structural variants allows us to easily handle these events during alignment, it does lead to an increase in the size of the reference string due to padding and, therefore, a higher memory overhead.
However, by filtering out some rare branches, it is possible to trade-off some accuracy for a lower memory consumption.
3.2 Exact matching  In this section, we present the algorithm for exactly matching a read to the reference multi-genome.
This algorithm is an exten- sion of the BWT-based backwards search algorithm presented in Section 2.
Let   represent one of the four A/C/T/G read bases and let    be the subset of the IUPAC characters that can match with  .
We have:  A Â¼ fM, H, N, V, R, D, W, Ag,  C Â¼ fS, B, Y, C, M, H, N, Vg,  G Â¼ fK, G, S, B, N, V, R, Dg and  T Â¼ fT, K, B, Y, H, N, D, Wg.
Also, let    represent an element of the set   .
Because each read base can match more than one IUPAC character, a given read R can match multiple different substrings in the reference multi-genome (e.g.
RÂ¼ AT will match the sub- strings AT, RW, AY and others) and, therefore, can align to more than one SA interval.
Let hLÃ°RÃž, UÃ°RÃži represent the set of SA intervals that start with a substring that matches the read R. If R occurs in the reference, then it can be easily shown that: Ã°3Ãž  hLÃ° RÃž, UÃ° RÃži Â¼  Â½LÃ°  RÃž, UÃ°  RÃž   [  8  2    where as before,  LÃ°  RÃž Â¼ CÃ°  Ãž Ã¾ OÃ°  , LÃ°RÃž   1Ãž Ã¾ 1  UÃ°  RÃž Â¼ CÃ°  Ãž Ã¾ OÃ°  , UÃ°RÃžÃž  Ã°4Ãž Ã°5Ãž  This result enables the iterative backward search for a read in the reference multi-genome.
That is, we can start (as before) with the SA interval of an empty string, hLÃ° Ãž, UÃ° Ãži Â¼ Â½0, n , and then iteratively fetch a base   from the end of the read re-calculating the SA interval set hLÃ° RÃž, UÃ° RÃži using Equations (3) (5) (here R refers to the partially assembled read).
This procedure can be repeated until R equals if LÃ°  RÃž4UÃ°  RÃž, the SA interval is not valid and is discarded.
For clarity, we demonstrate the alignment of the read AT with the reference multi-genome RWYAYA (the SA and BWT for  read.
Note  entire  that  the   this reference were computed in Fig.
4).
We start with the SA interval of the empty string, which is Â½0, 6 .
In the first iteration, we consider the last read base T. We calculate LÃ° TÃž and UÃ° TÃž for each of the eight characters in  T. Using Equations (4) and (5), we get Â½LÃ°YÃž, UÃ°YÃž  Â¼ Â½1, 2 , Â½LÃ°WÃž, UÃ°WÃž  Â¼ Â½4, 4  and no Therefore, matches hLÃ°TÃž, UÃ°TÃži Â¼ Â½1, 2  [ Â½4, 4 .
In the next iteration, we add A (the first base of the read) and calculate LÃ° ATÃž and UÃ° ATÃž for all  A 2  A.
The final result hLÃ°ATÃž, UÃ°ATÃži Â¼ Â½3, 4  [ Â½6, 6  can be easily verified.
characters.
remaining  the  for  To achieve reasonable performance, the number of SA inter- vals has to remain relatively small during alignment.
An expo- nential increase in the number of SA intervals with respect to the length of the read is unacceptable.
We have conducted a small experiment to track the number of SA intervals created during exact alignment with a human multi-genome.
More specifically, we have created a reference multi-genome by combining the SNPs of 1092 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010) with a popular refer- ence genome (build GRCh37) and then aligned to it 10-K simu- lated reads of length 100 uniformly sampled from the reference multi-genome.
Figure 7 illustrates the average and standard de- viation of the number of SA intervals created in each iteration.
As we can see, this value reaches its peak within the first 10 iterations and then dramatically drops to a small number.
In other words, the majority of SA intervals are created in the first 12 14 iterations of the backwards search.
Precalculating the SA intervals for all 12 14-base pair-long substrings can boost the performance.
This speedup technique is discussed later in the article.
3.3  Inexact matching  To tolerate sequencing errors and other variations of the reads from the reference multi-genome, we have extended the exact- matching backwards search algorithm to allow mismatches and gaps.
Figure 8 shows the high-level pseudo-code of the inexact matching algorithm used for aligning a given read R with the reference multi-genome G with up to n differences (mismatches or gaps).
This algorithm is an extension of the inexact search algorithm used by BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) and is guaranteed to find all the alignments with up to n differences.
To handle mismatches and deletions in the read, we consider all the IUPAC characters of the reference multi-genome alphabet (except #) in- stead of just the set of characters that a given read base matches to exactly.
After computing the new SA intervals for each of these characters, we advance the read position for matches/mis- matches but not for deletions.
To handle insertions, we just skip a given read position without recomputing the SA intervals.
We can easily check whether a read base matches a given character by computing the binary AND(&) of the read base and the char- acter Gray code values.
The ambiguous base N is considered a mismatch (not shown for simplicity).
By skipping #, we are able to avoid mapping across reference sub-sequence boundaries (e.g.
chromosome and bubble branch boundaries) since, when the reference multi-genome is assembled into one string, all the sub- sequences are separated by # (current aligners operate on four- letter A/C/T/G alphabets and need to discard such alignments during post-processing).

Inexact matching algorithm.
Returns the set of SA intervals of substrings of G matching R with up to n differences.
All the auxiliary BWT structures are assumed to have been already pre-computed for G  We have adapted several heuristics from the existing BWA aligner (Li and Durbin, 2009) for reducing the search space and improving the performance of the alignment algorithm.
In particular, given a read R, we compute a lower bound array, DÃ° Ãž, where DÃ°iÃž is the lower bound on the number of differences of matching the substring RÂ½0, i  with the reference.
This lower bound is computed in OÃ°jRjÃž time as described in (Li and Durbin, 2009).
By replacing the first condition of the InexactMatch procedure with n5DÃ°iÃž, we can terminate the search earlier, if DÃ°iÃž40.
To reduce the search space further, this algorithm has also been modified to prune out alignments that are considered sub-optimal even though they might contain less than the maximum number of allowed differences.
Similar to  i365   L.Huang et al.
BWA, we use a minimum priority heap-like structure of partial alignments based on alignment score (instead of using recursion) that allows us to process the entries with the best score first.
Depending on how many best hits are found and what is the best found difference, the search parameters are dynamically ad- justed and the search can be terminated early.
In particular, no sub-optimal alignments are explored if the number of best hits exceeds a given threshold.
Furthermore, if the number of differ- ences in the best hit, nbest, is less than n, then n is reset to nbest Ã¾ 1.
It is also possible to limit how many differences are allowed in the seed sequence (the first k base pairs at the beginning of the read, where k is the seed length and can be adjusted) and disallow insertions and deletions at the ends of the read.
Other search parameters available to the users of BWA (e.g.
mismatch, gap open and gap extension penalties) have also been incorporated to provide a similar user interface and improve the efficiency of the BWBBLE implementation.
Because the first 12 14 iterations account for a significant share of the computation time (see Fig.
7), we provide an option to precalculate the SA intervals resulting from exactly matching all possible k-length strings (k Â¼ 12 by default) with the given reference multi-genome.
The inexact alignment process can then start at position jRj   k of the read by looking up the result of mapping the last k read base pairs.
Similar to the con- struction of the BWT structures, this computation is a one-time effort done prior to the alignment stage.
We found the alignment to be six times faster with this setting when given 10-K 125-bp simulated reads and n Â¼ 6.
In terms of alignment results, this setting is equivalent to setting the seed length to k and allowing no differences in the seed, which does lead to a considerable decrease in the confidence and accuracy of the results depending on k.  3.4 Memory consumption  To reduce the memory requirement of the BWBBLE program, we compress the BWT string (using four bits to represent each of the 16 IUPAC characters) and only store a sampled subset of the auxiliary O and SA arrays, calculating the intermediate values as needed from the BWT string.
More specifically, we only store the values OÃ° , iÃž and SAÃ°iÃž where i is a multiple of the predefined interval sizes OCC_INTERVAL (default 128) and SA_INTERVAL (default 32), respectively.
To obtain the OÃ°c, jÃž value for a j that was not stored, we re-compute the number of times c occurs in the compressed BWT string after the closest available position.
To calculate SAÃ°jÃž the that was not following relation between the suffix array SA and the in- compressed suffix array   1 verse (Grossi and Vitter,   1Ã°iÃž Â¼ SAÃ°jÃž Â¼ SAÃ°Ã°  1ÃžÃ°kÃžÃ°jÃžÃž Ã¾ k, 2000): CÃ°BWTÂ½i Ãž Ã¾ OÃ°BWTÂ½i , iÃž and Ã°  1ÃžÃ°kÃž means applying   1 k times.
Therefore, we can repeatedly apply   1 until we obtain a position for which the SA value has been stored.

However, owing to the larger alphabet size of the reference multi-genome (16 IUPAC characters as opposed to four nucleotides), the memory requirement of the BWBBLE program is higher than that of the existing aligners.
Because these aligners only operate on four nucleotides A/C/G/T, they only need two bits to store  i366  each character of the BWT string and only need to record the occurrence of four different characters at every position of the OÃ° , Ãž array.
Therefore, given a genome of size n, they only need 2 n bits to store the BWT string and 4n log2 n bits to store the entire O array (for simplicity, we do not consider the reverse complement reference and the sampling of the O array here).
On the other hand, BWBBLE needs 4 n bits to store the BWT string and 16n log2 n bits to store the entire O array.
By increas- ing the interval at which the O values are stored, it is possible to reduce the BWBBLE memory consumption  however, this would increase the time needed to recompute the intermediate O values during the alignment stage.
The amount of n log2 n bits needed to store the SA array (used in the post-alignment stage) is the same for all the aligners.
It is also important to note that the length of the multi-genome reference is expected to be larger than the length of the single reference, as it includes bubbles as described in Section 3.1.2.
However, the cost of storing the reference multi- genome index is much smaller than the cost of storing the index for each genome in the population separately.
4 RESULTS  4.1  Implementation  The BWBBLE aligner was implemented in C. The program per- forms the indexing of and short-read alignment with a reference multi-genome  for convenience, it also provides a separate (faster) mode for aligning to a single genome.
Currently the pro- gram only supports alignment of single-end reads (paired-end alignment will be supported in the near future).
The program accepts the reference genome in the standard FASTA file format and the reads in the FASTQ file format.
The alignment results are reported using the SAM file format.
We provide a script to generate the FASTA file for the refer- ence multi-genome.
The script accepts a single-genome build (e.g.
GRCh37) FASTA file and a set of VCF files with SNPs and indels to be incorporated into the reference multi-genome  it allows users to specify how many genomes to integrate, the min- imum number of genomes a variation has to be present in to be integrated, the expected read size and others.
The BWBBLE program supports parallel execution for the alignment process.
The code was parallelized using OpenMP by splitting the reads among the parallel threads.
Furthermore, the program also uses the 128-bit registers of the Streaming SIMD Extensions to parallelize the character count in the com- pressed BWT string when retrieving occurrence values for pos- itions at which they were not stored (see Section 3.4).
BWBBLE is freely available at http://viq854.github.com/bwbble.
4.2 Experiments  To evaluate the performance of BWBBLE, we have created the reference multi-genome by combining the human genome build GRCh37 with the variants of 1090 individuals obtained from the October 2011 Integrated Variant Set release (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010).
Only variants occurring in three or more individuals were included.
The resulting multi-genome ref- erence incorporates 1 442 639 indels and 25 289 973 SNPs.
The size of its FASTA file is 3.2 GB (as opposed to 2.8 GB for the single GRCh37 file).
We compared the performance of BWBBLE with the state-of- the-art BWT-based single-genome aligner, BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009).
We evaluated BWBBLE against the multi-genome refer- ence, while BWA was run against the single-genome build GRCh37.
We ran BWA with its default parameters and used the same mapping quality threshold (namely, 10) to evaluate the confidence of the alignment results.
Reads with a mapping quality score higher than the given threshold were considered confidently aligned.
We compiled experimental results on simu- lated and real reads.
The accuracy of the results on simulated read data sets was computed by finding the percentage of the confidently aligned reads that were mapped to their correct pos- ition in the reference (note: owing to the presence of bubble branches, more than one multi-genome position can be con- sidered correct).
Furthermore, we also compared BWBBLE with the GCSA program (Siren et al., 2011) that performs indexing and short read alignment with a collection of multiple sequences.
All the experiments were performed on a 2.67 GHz Intel Xeon  X5550 processor.
4.2.1 BWT index construction To compute the suffix array SA, BWBBLE uses the sais library (Mori, 2008), which provides an implementation of the linear-time induced sorting SA construc- tion algorithm (Nong et al., 2011), adapted to support a larger input text size.
The BWT string can be easily computed from SA as described in Section 2.
The total time taken by the BWBBLE program to construct the BWT string and the auxiliary C, O and SA arrays of the reference multi-genome was 4025 s (1.1 h).
The BWA aligner took 4335.1 s (1.2 h) to index the GRCh37 genome.
4.2.2 Simulated read mapping We have prepared two types of simulated reads using the wgsim program (https://github.com/ lh3/wgsim).
The first type of simulated reads, simR, was gener- ated using the following standard wgsim parameters: sequencing base error rateÂ¼ 2%, SNP mutation rateÂ¼ 0.09% and indel mu- tation rateÂ¼ 0.01%.
To simulate the fact that in practice, we expect a set of reads to largely contain real known variants (rather than randomly generated SNPs), we have created two additional simulated read sets that incorporate known variants from two human genomes and have the wgsim mutation rate set to 0.
In particular, the second type of simulated reads was cre- ated by combining the SNPs and indels from two human genome builds, NA18626 (a Han Chinese from Beijing, China) and HG00122 (a British from England and Scotland), with the GRCh37 build and the following wgsim parameters: sequencing base error rateÂ¼ 2%, SNP mutation rateÂ¼ 0% and indel muta- tion rateÂ¼ 0%.
These reads are referred to as simNA and simHG, respectively.
The variations from these two human genome builds were not part of the 1090 individuals  variants included into the reference multi-genome.
Table 1 presents the simulated read results.
4.2.3 Real read mapping We used the two real read sets NA18626 and HG00122 sequenced by Illumina Genome Analyzer II and mapped to build GRCh37.
Table 2 presents the real read evaluation results.
Because the true mappings are not available for these datasets, only the alignment confidence results are shown.

4.2.4 Comparison with GCSA We compared BWBBLE with the GCSA program (Siren et al., 2011) that performs short read alignment with a collection of multiple sequences by build- ing a prefix-sorted finite automaton from the multiple alignment of the sequences in the collection.
GCSA constructs a generalized BWT-based index from the prefix-sorted automaton.
This method has the theoretical advantage of not requiring additional branching due to SNPs during the backwards search, at the ex- pense of the large amount of time and space required to build the index (the construction algorithm has exponential time and space complexity).
Owing to the high memory requirement of the prefix-sorted automaton construction, an external memory implementation is needed for the tool to run on a collection of human genomes, which is currently not ready.
For consistency with the GCSA article, we conducted the experiments on the smaller sequence of a single human chromosome 18 and used a set of 1 M reads of length 56 (corresponding to n Â¼ 3 differences) simulated using the wgsim program with the same parameters as simR.
The current GCSA implementation accepts as input the mul- tiple alignment of the sequences in the collection  however, for a large number of sequences, the time and space required for creat- ing the multiple sequence alignment using available software can be extremely large.
To alleviate this problem, we have created a multiple alignment of the 1092 individuals manually by integrat- ing only known SNPs from each individual, respectively, into chromosome 18 of GRCh37  the optimal multiple alignment is trivial for this scenario.
We have also created a reference multi- genome with SNPs only from the 1092 individuals for BWBBLE.
i367   L.Huang et al.
The GCSA index construction took 1.87 h, whereas BWBBLE index construction took 48 s.  the  Similar to the experiments in the GCSA article, we compared the running time and number of mapped reads for the two pro- grams: GCSA accuracy and confidence cannot be evaluated be- cause the position of mapped reads in the reference sequence is not reported.
The following results were obtained for the two tools: GCSA: (find operation only) 8932.93 s/98 307 matches  BWBBLE: 8439.21 s/94 364 matches.
GCSA finds more hits, al- though this does not imply that these matches are biologically plausible.
For example, the authors mention that they  have no limits on gaps , which could result in some implausible read mappings.
Without being able to evaluate the quality of the re- ported matches, it is difficult to assess their significance.
As ex- pected, the number of exact matches was similar for both tools: GCSA: 15 226 matches  BWBBLE: 15 268 matches.
5 DISCUSSION  Because, in practice, the number of differences (mutations and sequencing errors) between a 125-bp read and a single-genome reference is usually smaller than the BWA default of n Â¼ 6 dif- ferences, the BWA aligner is able to map most of the reads in the dataset, achieving high confidence and accuracy results.
However, on most datasets, the BWBBLE aligner does achieve slightly better confidence and accuracy values.
Because BWBBLE does not treat as mismatches the deviations from GRCh37 that are known SNPs, it can align reads that have more than n differences from GRCh37 when some of these dif- ferences are the SNPs included into the multi-genome reference.
Furthermore, because indels are incorporated by appending the bubble branches (with no restrictions on their length), BWBBLE can align reads that span known indels of any length (while BWA with default parameters can only handle indels up to length 6).
Therefore, BWBBLE can be expected to perform better on read sets that span a greater number of large indels or regions with a high SNP count (e.g.
reads from species that have a higher SNP density than humans  Tenaillon et al., 2001).
Zooming in on the evaluation results of the 100-K simNA dataset, we get the following performance counts: BWA (4332 unaligned, 92 735 confident, 92 645 correct)  BWBBLE (3330 un- aligned, 93 412 confident, 93 375 correct).
Out of the 4332 reads unaligned by BWA, 973 are confidently mapped by BWBBLE  out of which 933 are correctly aligned (with 134 reads aligned to appended bubble branches) and 40 are misaligned.
Figure 9 shows an example of a read mapped to a long indel and a read mapped to a region with a high concentration of SNPs (both of these reads were unaligned by BWA and correctly aligned by BWBBLE).
Note that because appending indels as bubble branches does not (by itself) require a change in the BWT back- wards search algorithm, existing aligners (e.g.
BWA) could use this technique to handle longer indels without a substantial modification to their code.
Furthermore, out of the 406 reads confidently aligned by BWA but not considered confident matches by BWBBLE, 376 were correctly aligned.
For 380 of these 406 reads BWBBLE found more than one best match and for the remaining reads it found too many sub-optimal matches.
Duplicated regions in the single-genome reference that have a few additional mutations will be likely aligned to with a different  i368  Fig.

(1) Read R from the simNA dataset unaligned to the single- genome reference S-G by BWA (with default parameters BWA can handle indels up to length 6) and correctly mapped to a bubble branch representing an insertion of 16 bp in the multi-genome reference M-G using BWBBLE.
(2) Read R from the simNA dataset unaligned to the single-genome reference S-G by BWA and correctly aligned using BWBBLE.
The mismatches between the read and the references are shown in red (for BWA this number exceeds the allowed six differences)  the SNPs in the M-G that match the read bases are shown in blue (these SNPs are treated as matches).

score by BWA and not treated as repeats.
However, if the mu- tations occurring in the repeats are only present in the subset of the population, they will be captured as SNPs in the multi- genome reference and can be aligned to with the same score by BWBBLE.
The alignment algorithm is entirely memory bound, and its running time is dominated by the random memory access pat- terns of the sampled occurrence array OÃ° , Ãž and the compressed BWT string during the SA interval computation.
Owing to the 4-fold increase in the size of the reference multi-genome alphabet, the BWBBLE program performs many more SA interval com- putations, which causes its running time to be significantly slower.
Namely, for each read base, the suffix array interval is computed for 16 (rather than four) different characters while differences (mismatches/gaps) are still allowed and for eight dif- ferent characters when only exact matching is allowed (an opti- mization used when the n differences have already been used up).
In particular, 188 826 valid SA intervals per read are found on average when aligning to the reference multi-genome during the inexact matching stage only (i.e.
while differences are allowed), as opposed to 8825 valid SA intervals for the single-genome refer- ence alignment.
For the 100-K read set, this is 18 billion more SA intervals (note: this figure does not include the additional SA interval computations that did not result in a valid interval and the SA intervals computed during the exact matching stage only).
However, although the runtime cost of aligning with a refer- ence multi-genome is very high, it is still significantly lower than the cost of aligning to each genome in the population separately.
For example, it would take about 109 200 s to align 100-K reads to 1092 genomes using BWA, and this time will grow linearly with the size of the genome collection.
On the other hand, while the BWBBLE running time does depend on the number of SNPs in the reference multi-genome, we expect that the SNP count (and the program performance) will not increase linearly with the number of genomes compiled into the multi-genome refer- ence.
This can be seen in Figure 10 that shows how the BWBBLE runtime changes as the number of genomes incorporated into the   Short read alignment with populations of genomes  results necessitates multiple reference indices to be built for each particular read length.
In addition, padding can also cause a significant increase in the length of the reference for highly variable species.
Although aligning to the reference multi-genome is much slower than to a single genome, it is considerably more efficient than aligning to each genome in a large collection separately.
As the number of sequenced genomes grows, aligning with BWBBLE should become much more time and space efficient.
Moreover, because BWBBLE can align reads that span long (known) indels, its utility will increase once large databases of structural variants are available.
BWBBLE can also be useful in functional genomics assays of parent/offspring trios, where un- biased peak calling is desired (Goncalves et al., 2012).
Finally, BWBBLE can output important information about the SNPs and structural variations that a given read was mapped to (e.g.
the number of genomes in the collection that contain this par- ticular variation), which should simplify and improve the current post-alignment processing pipeline.

BWBBLE running time vs. genome collection size.
The perform- ance is shown for each simulated and real read dataset.
The results for the following number of incorporated genomes are shown: 1109 (12 646 424 SNPs), 545 (23 271 932 SNPs) and 1090 (28 929 053 SNPs)  multi-genome reference grows.
Therefore, as the number of available genomes gets significantly larger, the speed-up of align- ing with BWBBLE as opposed to each genome individually will also be significantly greater.
Because BWBBLE runs on a multi-genome almost 100 times slower than BWA on a single genome, it is interesting to compute how many additional reads BWA can align in the same time frame to the genomes in the database (although when aligning to each reference separately, additional effort will have to be spent combining and interpreting the results).
To perform this experiment, we have created 99 genomes in addition to GRCh37 (100 genomes total) and aligned the simR, simNA, simHG, NA18626 and HG00122 read sets using BWA with each of these genomes individually.
More specifically, each genome was created by adding its known variants on top of build GRCh37.
The number of reads aligned has increased for each read set as follows: simR: 95 954 !
95 961  simNA: 95 668 !
96 655  simHG: 95 619 !
96 656  NA18626: 81 264 !
81 594  HG00122: 93 931 !
94 065.
BWBBLE aligned the following number of reads to the original 1090 individuals multi-genome and the 99 individuals multi-genome (note: no rare variant fil- tering was performed for this reference), respectively: simR: (96 252  96 283)  simNA: (96 647  96 641)  NA18626: (81 627  81 598)  HG00122: (93 720  93 713).
As expected, BWA (and BWBBLE on the 99 individuals multi- genome) aligned most of the same reads that BWBBLE aligned to the 1090 multi-genome, as many of the variants can be ex- pected to be present in these 100 genomes.
(96 670  96 633)  simHG:  6 CONCLUSION  in the  In this article, we proposed a compact representation for a col- lection of genomes (the reference multi-genome) that captures the genomic variations collection and presented BWBBLE, a BWT-based short-read aligner that operates on this compiled reference.
We demonstrated the performance of BWBBLE on a human reference multi-genome incorporating variants from 1090 individuals.
A limitation of our reference multi-genome representation is its use of read length dependent padding to capture structural variants, which to achieve best   Section  Let s assume that all   s are equal (this assumption will be lifted later).
Without loss of generality, we rename all c s to be c1, c2, c3, c4 and assume 1   c1   c2   c3   c4.
As mentioned to in c1 Â¼ 1, c2 Â¼ 1, c3 Â¼ 2, c4 Â¼ 4.
To demonstrate that the Gray code results in the minimized E, we will disproof the existence of the following two cases: (i) c1 Â¼ 1, c2 Â¼ 1, c3 Â¼ 1, c4   4 and (ii) c1 Â¼ 1, c2 Â¼ 1, c3 Â¼ 2, c454.
four-bit Gray  3.1.1,  leads  code  the  PROOF: We represent an IUPAC symbol with four features, each for an A/C/G/T base.
The feature associated with base  i is denoted by  i if base  i can match this IUPAC character, and it is denoted by   i if base  i does not match this character.
The  don t care  features are omitted.
For instance, the IUPAC sym- bols that match base  2 but do not match  1 have the features Ã°   1 2Ãž.
Case (i).
Suppose an order   with c1 Â¼ 1, c2 Â¼ 1, c3 Â¼ 1 exists.
Define uj Â¼ the jth smallest IUPAC symbol in this order.
Because c1 Â¼ 1, the IUPAC symbols with features Ã° 1 2Ãž and the symbols with Ã° 1   2Ãž are consecutive in  .
Similarly, because we have c2 Â¼ 1, the symbols with Ã° 1 2Ãž and those with Ã°   1 2Ãž are also consecutive.
With these two constraints, we assign uiÃ¾1 uiÃ¾4 to the symbols with Ã° 1   2Ãž, uiÃ¾5 uiÃ¾8 to the codes with Ã° 1 2Ãž, to the symbols with features Ã°   1 2Ãž, where and uiÃ¾9 uiÃ¾12 0   i   4.
To meet the requirement of c3 Â¼ 1, we need to assign ujÃ¾1 ujÃ¾8 to the symbols with Ã° 1 2 3Ãž, Ã°   1 2 3Ãž, Ã° 1   2 3Ãž and Ã°   1   2 3Ãž.
A value j that meets this demand does not exist and therefore we reach a contradiction.
Case (ii).
To make c3 Â¼ 2, we need to assign uiÃ¾3 uiÃ¾6 and uiÃ¾11 uiÃ¾14 to the IUPAC symbols with Ã° 3Ãž, where 0   i   2.
Without loss of generality, let i be 0.
Thus, to guarantee that all 16 IUPAC codes represent distinct subsets of four bases, for any k we know that u2kÃ¾1 and u2kÃ¾2 must have opposite features for base  4  that is, one is Ã° 4Ãž while the other one must be Ã°   4Ãž.
The only assignment that makes c4 Â¼ 4 is assigning u4kÃ¾2 u4kÃ¾3 to the symbols with the feature Ã° 4Ãž for all 0   k   3.
In any order, c4 cannot be smaller than four.
In the context of the human genome, the nucleotides A and T occur more frequently than C and G. In other words,  A    T4 C    G. With the nucleotide-to-bit assignment cA Â¼ 1, cT Â¼ 1, cC Â¼ 2, cG Â¼ 4.
The bAbTbCbG, we have expected SA interval number can be rewritten as: E Â¼  A   1 Ã¾  T   1 Ã¾  C   2 Ã¾  G   4  Switching any two values in the c s assignment will result in the increment of the E value.
Therefore, this assignment is the opti- Å“ mal solution for this problem.
