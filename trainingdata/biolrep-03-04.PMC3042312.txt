Abstract
Chemical signaling via the production of small molecules such as hormones has been studied in detail in
higher organisms. These molecules have important functions in maintaining physiological homeostasis
as well as allowing organisms to respond to external
insults. Virtually every living cell produces
hormone-like diffusible small molecules that can be used to convey messages to neighboring cells—a
vital step in adaptation, development, and survival within populations. Although most of our knowledge
it is now
on cellular chemical communication comes from studies of multicellular eukaryotes,
understood that bacteria can also communicate using sophisticated signaling systems,
in a way
analogous to those used by higher organisms. Many of these microbes live in close association with
higher eukaryotes, in mutualistic or commensal relationships. We suggest that there may be a wealth of
unidentified bioactive small molecules in the human body, originating from both microbial and human
cells and that have important biological functions. Because chemical signaling has important roles for
the biology of both microbes and humans, detecting, identifying, and studying these chemical signals can
further our understanding of the chemical interplay between microbiota and their hosts and provide us
with an unexplored source of molecules that could be used for human benefit.

Microbial chemical signaling
Following the landmark discovery of the structure of
DNA in 1953, much of biological research shifted from
an organismal to a molecular perspective. In the past few
decades, a great deal has been learned about the role
played by macromolecules not only DNA, but also RNA
and proteins—in biological systems. Coincidental to
these studies was the discovery that many important
biological
functions are associated with molecules
that are not categorized in any of the above molecular
groups [1-5]. Such compounds have been referred to
as “small molecules”, a general term that is usually
associated with any compound of molecular weight
around or under 3000 Da and with chemical character-
istics that preclude their description as DNA, RNA, or
proteins. Small molecules have critical biological func-
tions in humans: they control immune functions, the
development of sexual characteristics, stress responses,
metabolism, and mineral balance, amongst others [6-9].

In higher organisms, these small molecules are called
hormones—from the Greek for “excite” or “arouse”—a
term coined in 1905 by Ernest Starling [10]. They are
produced by one organ of the body and travel to distant
organs to exert physiological effects.

Although much of our knowledge about chemical
signaling comes from the study of mammalian and
plant hormones, it is now known that bacteria can also
produce, sense, and respond to small-molecule signals
that allow them to act coordinately. Studies conduc-
ted throughout the 1960s by the research groups of
Alexander Tomasz on the acquisition and incorporation
of foreign DNA by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Woodland
Hastings on Vibrio fischeri luminescence led to the dis-
covery that self-produced diffusible molecules played
important roles in the lifestyle of these microbes [11-14].
Although the consequences of such discoveries were not
fully appreciated at the time, they formed the foundation

for studies of bacterial communication. It is now widely
accepted that many bacterial species use small chemical
compounds to communicate with each other and their
hosts. These hormone-like molecules are usually pro-
duced at a low level and exert their effects when they
reach a threshold concentration, allowing bacteria to
sense and respond to their populational density [15-18].
Because this phenomenon is dependent upon a thresh-
old cell density, bacterial communication has been
termed quorum sensing [19]. Nowadays,
there are
many known classes of bacterial signaling molecules,
such as the acyl-homoserine lactones, peptides, quino-
lones, and α-hydroxyketones, among others [15-18,20].
The chemical repertoire used by bacteria to communicate
is diverse and new signaling molecules continue to
emerge.

their main biological

Chemical signaling in complex environments
Studies of bacterial signaling have focused mostly on
laboratory-grown, pure cultures of microorganisms.
However, this is an artificial setting; in the environment
and in their hosts, microbes live in association with a
multitude of other species and are constantly presented
with opportunities for competition and cooperation.
For example, at elevated “unnatural” concentrations,
we know that microbial signaling molecules can have
antimicrobial properties. However, when these “anti-
biotics” are produced by microbes in the environment,
they are unlikely to be present at concentrations high
enough to exert antimicrobial activity, so it is probable
that
function is to modulate
bacterial gene expression rather than to poison [21,22].
Indeed, chemical signaling has been shown to be an
important facet of microbial interactions in the soil
environment, and examples of signaling between
different microbial species as well as between microbes
and plants, both in symbiosis and pathogenesis, exist.
In the N2-fixation-driven symbiosis between Rhizobium
and its legume host, many chemical signals act to
promote the establishment of a mutually beneficial
relationship [23-26]. The bacteria can sense plant-
produced small molecules; the root exudates contain-
ing flavonoids induce microbial migration to the root
surface. Here, quorum sensing occurs through the
production of acyl-homoserine lactones, culminating
in the production of nodulation factors (made up of
lipochito-oligosaccharides) by the bacteria, which
induce nodule formation in the plant host [23-26].
Although there is a wealth of
information about
chemical signaling in soil, many other complex
microbial populations exist in nature, and it is certain
that microbial signaling plays important roles in these
communities.

The mammalian gut as an environment for
extensive chemical signaling
At birth, humans are colonized by complex communities
of microbes. These communities, which are established
within the first year of life, have been termed microbiota,
microflora, or microbiome and are extremely rich,
containing upwards of 1014 cells [27-29]. These popula-
tions are normally harmless; in fact, they are essential to
our health. Microbes colonize our skin, gastrointestinal,
genitourinary, and respiratory tracts. It has been esti-
mated that the number of microbes in and on our bodies
exceeds our own cells by more than one order of
magnitude [27-29]. Even more strikingly, it has been
suggested that the collection of microbial genes in our
bodies exceeds our own genes by a factor of 100, which
means that
the human genome is predominantly
prokaryotic [30,31]! Although virtually every body sur-
face that
is exposed to the environment contains
microbes, the gastrointestinal tract is by far the most
heavily colonized site. Each individual carries an estimated
1000 distinct bacterial species in their gut [32] and the
collective human microbiome has been estimated to
contain 35,000 bacterial species or more [33]. This offers a
tremendous opportunity for the evolution of multiple
microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions, many
of which are conveyed through the activity of small
signaling molecules.

Although it has been known for a while that commensal
organisms can use diffusible signals to interact with
their hosts, as yet, only a few defined examples of such
microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions in the
mammalian gastrointestinal tract have been shown to
exist. For example, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a promi-
nent member of the human gastrointestinal tract micro-
biome, produces signals that can control host gene
expression and epithelial surface glycosylation [34,35].
By doing so, B. thetaiotaomicron controls the availability
of nutrients in its surroundings to favor its own growth.
More recently, this intestinal commensal has also been
shown to communicate with pathogens by producing a
yet unidentified signal that can control virulence factor
production by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli [36].
This suggests that colonization by this species of
bacteria, and potentially others, may be an important
tool used by mammals to control infection by virulent
bacteria.

In addition to those produced by the microbiota, host-
produced small molecules can have profound effects on
both commensals and pathogens. The mammalian hor-
mones epinephrine and norepinephrine have been shown
to affect commensal microbial populations in the gastro-
intestinal tract and can also influence the production of

F1000 Biology Reports 2011, 3:4

http://f1000.com/reports/b/3/4

virulence factors by invading pathogens [37-39]. For
instance, enterohemorrhagic E. coli can sense intestinal
epinephrine and norepinephrine, causing it to activate its
type-III secretion virulence system [38]. Also, Campylobacter
jejuni can respond to norepinephrine by upregulating its
ability to enter into (invade) host cells [39]. These examples
illustrate that microbial signaling does occur in the human
body and is required in a number of critical processes.

Although these examples indicate that the intestinal
microbiota is involved in numerous biological processes
localized to the gastrointestinal epithelium and lumen, it
is now well established that the microbiota has an
impact on host tissues and organs with which it is not in
direct contact. This is exemplified by the role of the
intestinal microbiota in several pathological processes of
the underlying gastrointestinal immune system, as well
as those affecting remote tissues and organs. Intestinal
commensals can impact inflammatory bowel disease,
diabetes, asthma, obesity, cancer, and even depression
[27,40-51]. In most cases, the molecular mechanisms of
microbial involvement in these diseases are not known,
but because of the important role played by microbial
signaling in host functions in the intestinal tract, it is
highly likely that microbial chemical signals play a role
in some or all of these diseases. The fact that the organs
affected by these diseases are not in direct contact with
gut commensals suggests that diffusible compounds may
be involved (Figure 1). Wikoff et al. [52] have recently
shown that intestinal microbes can have a significant
impact on the levels of certain mammalian blood
metabolites, suggesting that
the influence of gut
microbes on the human body may be largely dependent
on the activities of small molecules that are able to act at
a distance. Additionally, associations between intestinal
small molecules and microbiota-associated pathologies
have been described. Through a metabolomics study of
the fecal contents of human twins, Jansson et al. [53]
found that changes in the levels of many microbial small
molecules are associated with disease status when they
compared healthy subjects with inflammatory bowel
disease patients. Additionally, they also found that levels
of specific groups of commensal microbes correlated
with levels of the metabolites affected. We are only
beginning to realize that there is a rich and complex
mixture of molecules that exert important effects on all
the organisms involved,
the
intestinal ecosystem. Studying this complex chemical
lexicon will be essential to a complete understanding of
the relationships between microbes and humans.

inside and outside of

The intestinal metabolome
The majority of the microbial species present in the
mammalian gut cannot be cultured in the laboratory.

This has forced the use of culture-independent methods to
study the composition of microbial communities in and
on humans. Most studies rely on metagenomics, the
unbiased sequencing of all the DNA fragments isolated
from a mixed microbial population [54-56]. More
recently, the intestinal environment has been studied
through other culture-independent methods such as
metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics [57,58], which
focus on the unbiased analysis of messenger RNA and
proteins, respectively. Altogether, these explorations of the
microbial diversity in the gastrointestinal tract suggest that
there is significant phylogenetic diversity that remains to
be explored [54,59]. Although these studies have provided
much information about the composition of microbial
communities in the mammalian gut, they tell us very little
about the functions of the components of the system or
the interactions between them, and it is only recently that
we have begun to decipher the molecular functions of
these assemblages. However, based on the overwhelming
amount of genetic material present in the human gut
metagenome (the combination of all genes present in the
gastrointestinal tract), we can predict that many biological
reactions with the potential to be immensurable sources of
bioactive small molecules are yet to be discovered.

—

In addition, as the mammalian gut is an important
component in the host’s excretion of metabolic “waste”
(i.e., the unwanted products of metabolic reactions),
many host-produced small molecules are also found in
this environment. Therefore, the gastrointestinal tract is
loaded with small molecules, from both the host and the
microbiota, that could have a significant impact on the
gastrointestinal tract itself and other organs through re-
absorption. This chemical lexicon the metabolome
is—
mostly unknown, mainly due to the lack of appropriate
techniques to study its composition. However, as a result
of recent advances in methods of chemical separation and
structural elucidation, particularly in methods for high-
throughput analysis of complex samples, we now have
tools to probe the chemical conversations that we did not
even know existed a few years ago. One such technique is
the extremely sensitive and accurate Fourier transform ion
cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS),
which has been recently used with direct infusion mass
spectrometry to study the metabolome of both human
and murine plasma [60]. FTICR-MS allows the rapid
detection and relative quantification of thousands of
molecules in complex biological matrices. In many cases,
the accuracy of the mass determination is sufficient to
allow metabolite identification based on mass alone. We
have used FTICR-MS to study the intestinal metabolome
and found that thousands of small molecules are present
in the mammalian gut, the majority of which is affected by
antibiotic treatment, thus suggesting that the intestinal

Figure 1. Potential roles and applications of small molecules in the intestinal tract

Small molecules are produced in the intestine by both host and microbial cells. Microbial molecules can exert direct effects on host cells and vice-versa.
Additionally, the molecules can play an important role in interactions between different microbial components in the intestinal ecosystem; they can be used
for cooperation, maintenance of community stability or recovery after an insult, and competition. The molecules can also be absorbed into the intestinal
epithelium. This is true for newly synthesized microbial molecules or recycled host molecules, which can be excreted in the intestinal lumen and reabsorbed.
Such molecules can reach the bloodstream and exert effects on remote organs such as the brain, lungs, and pancreas, as well as other intestinal sites. They can
also affect energy balance and impact obesity and other diseases of the organs mentioned above (autism, depression, allergy, diabetes, inflammatory bowel
disease, and so on). Once harvested and studied, these compounds can be used for a multitude of purposes; they can serve several therapeutic roles as
antibiotics, anti-cancer therapies, anti-inflammatories, antidepressants, and probiotics, amongst others.

microbiota has a major impact on the chemical composi-
tion of the intestinal environment (Antunes and Finlay,
submitted for publication). Metabolic studies of samples
from healthy and disturbed intestinal ecosystems will
allow us to predict causative associations between
chemical variations and specific disease states. Hypotheses
can then be tested using small molecules (natural or
synthetic) to treat conditions in animal models.

Exploring the intestinal metabolome for
bioactive molecules
The study of natural biological products from a diverse
array of organisms has provided us with a wealth of
information on the important roles played by small
molecules in biological systems. Additionally, whenever
possible, humans have taken advantage of these products
for their therapeutic activities (e.g., in antibiotic, antic-
ancer, and anti-inflammatory compounds) [61-63]. Most
have been isolated from microorganisms, but some also
come from plants and marine organisms. The discovery
that the human body is made up of extremely complex
ecosystems suggests that it, too, could be used as a rich
source of new bioactive molecules. Small molecules in
the mammalian gastrointestinal tract are likely to have
important functions in the relationship between hosts
and their commensal microbes. Since these populations
play a key role in human health and disease,
the
molecules involved may have potential as therapeutics
aimed at maintaining or reestablishing homeostasis to
prevent or cure diseases. Such activities may involve
antibiosis, the capacity to kill other microorganisms,

which could be explored not only in the context of
intestinal infections but also for numerous other infec-
tions throughout the body. These molecules will also
affect host biology, possibly at the interface between
microbial populations and the gut-associated immune
system. It is known that the microbiota exerts important
effects on the maturation of the mammalian immune
system, so the small molecules in the intestine could be
used to modulate these relationships in controlled ways.
An even more daring possibility is that some of these
molecules could be used to manipulate the physiology
of remote organs and systems. As mentioned previously,
the intestinal microbiota can impact diseases such as
allergies, diabetes, asthma, and depression, and there is
increasing evidence that it is involved in mental devel-
opment. Therefore, it is possible that the molecules
produced by some of the microbes associated with
protection against
these diseases could be used to
remediate or prevent them.

It’s a small-molecule world
Since its discovery, DNA has been considered the
foundation of life. Its capacity to store information
coupled with its remarkable stability make it the prime
candidate for the molecule from which life, as we know
it, originated. This concept is imprinted in the “central
dogma”, which states that DNA holds all genetic
information, which is passed on to RNA as a messenger
molecule and then translated into proteins, which
constitute the machinery and structures that carry out
the molecular processes essential for life (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Small molecules as important messengers of biological information and function

DNA encodes the genetic information that is passed on to RNA, which acts as the messenger for the synthesis of proteins. Protein enzymatic function can
then give rise to a plethora of structurally diverse small molecules. In many cases, these molecules are the primary effectors of biological functions, acting at
the DNA, RNA, and protein levels.

Although generally accepted, this viewpoint has been
challenged. In 1986, Walter Gilbert suggested that RNA
preceded DNA as a self-replicating primitive form of life,
giving this molecule a main role in the formation of life
[64]. Indeed, RNA molecules with enzymatic functions
still exist [65]. Although both DNA and RNA have central
functions in the maintenance and decoding of genetic
information, the real effectors of these functions are
proteins. In the case of structural proteins, they represent
the end of the road for a given biological property or
function. However, for the majority of proteins, catalytic
activity is the main function,
thus extending their
biological properties to the products of the reactions
catalyzed: a plethora of structurally diverse small
molecules. It is, therefore, these small molecules that
constitute the raison d’être of biological function in most
cases. Without identifying and studying these molecules,
we will not fully understand the functions of metabolic
pathways and the interconnections between them. Nor
will we be able to fully comprehend the complexities of
any biological system. We now have the tools to delve
into the unexplored sources of many intriguing mole-
cules in our own bodies. This should be done not only
with an intellectual view toward understanding the
molecular intricacies of life in more detail but also
with a practical view of benefiting from what these
molecules may have to offer.
