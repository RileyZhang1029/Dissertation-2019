Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRs) are short (18-22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that are important in regulating
gene expression. MiR expression is deregulated in many types of cancers,
including leukemias.
In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the expression of specific miRs has been linked with both
prognostically and cytogenetically defined subgroups. Recent studies have shown that deregulation of
miR expression is not simply a consequence of AML but a potential contributer to leukemogenesis.
This commentary will focus on select findings that describe the different mechanistic roles for miRs in
the development of leukemia.

Introduction and context
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous dis-
ease that is often classified by the presence of specific,
recurrent chromosomal alterations that generate unique
oncogenic fusion genes. These alterations are associated
with the expansion of cells that have arrested at different
stages of differentiation, and have distinct prognoses and
gene expression profiles (reviewed in [1,2]). Recently, it
has been shown that different subtypes of AML are also
associated with distinct microRNA (miR) profiles.

MiRs are small non-coding RNAs that are thought to
0
regulate gene expression by base pairing with the 3
untranslated region of a target gene mRNA, leading to
degradation and/or translational repression. Each indi-
vidual miR is thought to have multiple target genes and it
has been proposed that miRs may represent a mechan-
ism for cells to quickly change the expression of a large
number of genes, as required during processes such as
differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has
been shown that the profile of expressed miRs changes
significantly during hematopoietic differentiation
(reviewed in [3,4]).

Different subtypes of AML have also been associated
with different miR expression profiles. Multiple studies
have shown that unsupervised clustering using miR

expression strongly correlates with known morphologi-
cal and cytogenic subgroups [5-8]. In addition, it has
been shown that distinct miR expression signatures
correlate with AML survival rates [12]. There are extensive
reviews concerning miR expression and AML subgroups
and prognoses, (see e.g., [13,14]).

The relationship between the expression of a specific miR
(or group of miRs) and AML subtype has important
implications for prognosis and treatment of AML
[11,12]. However, as it is known that miR expression
changes with normal hematopoietic differentiation
[3,4], it is possible that the differential expression of
many miRs in AML could be due to the stage at which
differentiation arrest of the leukemic blasts occured and
may not have a causal role in the leukemic process.
However, some recent studies have described a mechan-
istic role for individual miRs in the development of AML
and will be the focus of this review.

Major recent advances
One of the first studies to show a role for a specific
miR in AML was Li et al. [8]. They found that increased
expression of miR-126/126* was not only associated
with the AML subgroups carrying the related chromoso-
mal alterations t(8:21) and inv(16), it also inhibited
apoptosis and increased AML cell viability. They also

showed that this effect was likely mediated through
decreased expression of the miR-126/126* target, which
encodes the tumor suppressor PLK2 (Polo-like kinase 2).
Interestingly, Li et al. [8] showed that the increased
expression of miR-126/126* was likely mediated by
promoter hypomethylation.

Recent evidence suggests that repression of miR-29b
may also play a causative role in the AML subgroups
defined by t(8:21) and inv(16). Decreased expression of
miR-29b was shown to indirectly cause increased
expression of the tyrosine kinase KIT [15] and contribute
to leukemogenesis. This finding is of particular interest
in regard to t(8:21) and inv(16) AMLs because gain-
of-function mutations in KIT are known to be associated
with decreased survival in patients in this AML cytoge-
netic subgroup [16].

Causative roles for miRs have also been described in
AMLs with fusion genes involving the mixed-lineage
leukemia (MLL) gene. Popovic et al. [17] showed that the
MLL-AF9 fusion gene caused overexpression of miR-
196b and that expression of this miR was required for
MLL-AF9-induced immortilization.

A similar role for the miR-17-92 cluster in leukemias
expressing MLL fusion genes has also been identified.
Like miR-196b, individual miRs in the miR17-92 cluster
were shown to be overexpressed in leukemias with MLL
rearrangements, which increased proliferation and
decreased apoptosis [18,19]. Interestingly, Mi et al. [18]
showed that MLL fusion proteins were capable of
binding the promoter region of the miR17-92 cluster
and activating the expression of the individual miRs. This
indicates that these miRs not only play a functional role
in MLL-rearranged AML, but are also direct targets of the
fusion genes.

A potential role for miR-125b-2, located on chromo-
some 21, has recently been connected to trisomy 21/
Down syndrome-related acute megakaryoblastic leuke-
mia (DS-AMKL) [20]. Overexpression of miR-125b-2
was shown to increase proliferation and self-renewal,
and these effects were accentuated in the presence of
the GATA1 mutation that results in the expression of
GATA1s (the short isoform), which is present in nearly
all cases of DS-AMKL [21,22]. In addition, Klusmann
et al. [20] identified two potential downstream targets of
miR-125b-2, DICER1 and ST18, both of which are genes
previously shown to be downregulated in cancer.

Future directions
The examples discussed in this review indicate that
deregulated expression of miRs can be an important step

in leukemogenesis and that the expression of miRs
can be affected by a number of different mechanisms.
Continued investigation into the role of miRs and their
target genes promises to yield new insights into the
mechanisms of leukemogenesis. Most importantly, miRs
may represent an important target for the development
of new therapeutics for the treatment of AML. As an
individual miR is likely to affect the expression of several
different genes, therapies directed at miRs could poten-
tially target multiple leukemogenic processes.
