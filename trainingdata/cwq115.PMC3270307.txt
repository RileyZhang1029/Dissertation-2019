The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is the causative
agent of the cattle disease Nagana and human African
sleeping sickness. Glycoproteins play key roles in the para-
site’s survival and infectivity, and the de novo biosyntheses
of the sugar nucleotides UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal), UDP-
N-acetylglucosamine, and GDP-fucose have been shown to
be essential for their growth. The only route to UDP-Gal in
T. brucei is through the epimerization of UDP-glucose
(UDP-Glc) by UDP-Glc 4′-epimerase. UDP-Glc is also
the glucosyl donor for the unfolded glycoprotein glucosyl-
transferase (UGGT) involved in glycoprotein quality
control in the endoplasmic reticulum and is the presumed
donor for the synthesis of base J (β-D-glucosylhydroxy-
methyluracil), a rare deoxynucleotide found in telomere-
proximal DNA in the bloodstream form of T. brucei.
Considering that UDP-Glc plays such a central role in car-
bohydrate metabolism, we decided to characterize UDP-Glc
biosynthesis in T. brucei. We identified and characterized the
parasite UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (TbUGP), re-
sponsible for the formation of UDP-Glc from glucose-
1-phosphate and UTP, and localized the enzyme to the
peroxisome-like glycosome organelles of the parasite.
Recombinant TbUGP was shown to be enzymatically ac-
tive and specific for glucose-1-phosphate. The high-
resolution crystal structure was also solved, providing a
framework for the design of potential inhibitors against
the parasite enzyme.

Introduction

Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), commonly known as
“sleeping sickness”, is a vector borne-parasitic disease caused
by the kinetoplastid Trypanosoma brucei. The disease pro-
gresses through two stages following an asymptomatic period
of several weeks or months. The early stage is usually character-
ized by malaria-like symptoms, including fatigue, headache,
recurrent fever, and swollen lymph nodes. In advanced stages,
the disease aﬀects the central nervous system, causing severe
neurological and mental disorders and making the individual de-
pendent on others. Infected individuals are weakened, often for
many years, causing economic loss, poverty, and social misery.
HAT is completely fatal if untreated, and it constitutes a major
public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa (Favre et al. 2008).
Given the resurgence of both human and animal trypanosomia-
sis, its epidemic potential, high fatality rate, and signiﬁcant
impact on socioeconomic development, there is a clear need
for new therapeutics to control the disease.

The trypanosome life cycle alternates between a mammalian
host and the tsetse ﬂy Glossina spp., and the diﬀerent life cycle
stages are adapted to survive in each host. In the host-dwelling
bloodstream form of the parasite, a protective coat of 5 × 106
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored variant surface
glycoprotein (VSG) homodimers is expressed on the plasma
membrane. The parasite survives the immune attack of the host
because it undergoes antigenic variation, a process that involves
replacement of the VSG coat by another composed of antigen-
ically diﬀerent VSG molecules (Cross 1996). In addition to
VSG, the bloodstream form parasite also expresses less abun-
dant but equally essential glycoproteins, such as the transferrin
receptor and the lysosomal p67 glycoprotein (Kelley et al. 1999;
Alexander et al. 2002). This has lead to the investigation of po-
tential therapeutic targets against parasite glycoprotein
biosynthesis, such as enzymes of GPI and sugar nucleotide bio-
synthesis (Turnock et al. 2007; Turnock and Ferguson 2007).

Sugar nucleotides are the ultimate source of sugar for the
majority of glycosylation reactions. They are formed in two
main ways: by salvage pathways, involving activation of the
sugar using a kinase and subsequent condensation with a nu-
cleotide via a pyrophosphorylase, or by de novo pathways,

involving the bioconversion of an existing sugar/sugar nucleo-
tide. In most cases, sugar nucleotides are synthesized in the
cytoplasm and used there and/or transported through speciﬁc
transporters into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and/or
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they are used by glycosyl-
transferases as donor substrates in glycosylation reactions
(Freeze and Elbein 2008). In T. brucei, our knowledge of sugar
nucleotide biosynthesis has expanded in the last few years and it
has been shown that several steps in the de novo biosynthesis of
GDP-fucose (Turnock et al. 2007), UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal)
(Roper et al. 2002, 2005; Urbaniak et al. 2006), and UDP-
N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) (Stokes et al. 2008) occur
in the glycosome and are essential for parasite growth. However,
several issues remain unsolved, including the pathway to and
location of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) biosynthesis.

UDP-Glc is the sugar nucleotide acting as a donor of glucose
in diverse biochemical pathways and is a central metabolite both
in prokaryota and eukaryota. In eukaryotic cells, UDP-Glc
is essential in the synthesis of diverse glucose-containing
glycolipids, glycoproteins, and a variety of secondary metabo-
lites (Flores-Diaz et al. 1997). Furthermore, it plays a crucial role
for the “quality control” of newly synthesized glycoproteins
taking place in the ER (Hammond and Helenius 1995). Thus,
UDP-Glc is the glucosyl donor for the unfolded glycoprotein
glucosyltransferase (UGGT) involved in the calnexin- and/or
calreticulin-mediated glycoprotein quality control refolding
cycles in the ER. In T. brucei, UGGT has been shown to be es-
sential for parasite growth and survival at 40°C, and a
UGGT null mutant was hypersensitive to the eﬀects of the N-
glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (Izquierdo et al. 2009).
UDP-Glc is also the presumed donor for the synthesis of base

J (β-D-glucosylhydroxymethyluracil), a rare deoxynucleotide
of unknown function found in telomere-proximal DNA in the
bloodstream form of T. brucei (van Leeuwen et al. 1998).

The de novo UDP-Glc biosynthetic pathway involves three
steps starting from glucose: (a) generation of Glc-6-P, via a
hexokinase activity; (b) transfer of the phosphate group from
position 6 to position 1, through the action of a phospho-
glucomutase; and (c) coupling of Glc-1P to UTP. This last,
reversible, step is catalyzed by UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase
(UGP; EC 2.7.7.9).

In this paper, we conﬁrm that

the putative T. brucei
UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (TbUGP) gene (GeneDB ID:
Tb10.389.0330) encodes a functional and highly speciﬁc
UGP enzyme,
localize native TbUGP to the glycosomes
and describe its high-resolution crystal structure in complex
with UDP-Glc.

be involved in substrate binding (SB) in the UGP crystal struc-
tures from other organisms (Figure 1) (Lamerz et al. 2006). The
only residue involved in catalytic activity that is diﬀerent in the
T. brucei sequence is Gly221, which is an Ile in the H. sapiens
and Bos taurus orthologues. TbUGP was found to have 37%
amino acid identity with the human enzyme.

The TbUGP open reading frame was ampliﬁed from T. brucei
strain 427 genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using a high-ﬁdelity polymerase, and the consensus
sequence (EMBL nucleotide sequence database accession no.
FN662556) predicts a 485-amino acid protein of 54,507 Da.
The same sequence was also obtained when the gene was
ampliﬁed from cDNA (EMBL nucleotide sequence database
accession no. FN662557) using the same TbUGP 3′-primer and
a 5′-spliced leader primer described in Materials and methods.
T. brucei genes are generally free of introns and are transcribed
in polycistronic units that are processed by trans-splicing with a
common 35-nucleotide “miniexon” or “spliced leader” sequence
(LeBowitz et al. 1993). Comparison of the cDNA and genomic
sequences allowed us to determine the precise site of trans-splic-
ing for this gene, which, as expected, occurs in a polypyrimidine
tract, 113 bases upstream of the ATG codon. The predicted ami-
no acid sequence for TbUGP from T. brucei strain 427 was
almost identical to that in the T. brucei strain 927 genome data-
base, except for substitution of Ser for Phe at position 54 and Ser
for Asn at position 473. Neither residue is believed to be in-
volved in the active site.

Semi quantitative RT (reverse transcription)–PCR, using
RNA from T. brucei bloodstream and procyclic form, showed
that the TbUGP mRNA is present in both life cycle stages
(Figure 2A).

Polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant enzyme (see
Materials and methods) were raised in mice and aﬃnity puriﬁed
against immobilized recombinant protein. These antibodies
failed to detect any relevant cross-reactivity with other proteins
present in the cell (Figure 2B, lane 2) and due to the low
abundance of TbUGP in the cell, it could only be detected
in immunoprecipitates of 2 × 108 bloodstream form cells
(Figure 2B, lane 3). These results show the monospeciﬁcity
of the antibodies used in the cellular localization experiment
(Figure 5) and also suggest that TbUGP protein expression
level is similar to other enzymes involved in sugar nucleotide
biosynthesis (Roper et al. 2002).

Expression of monomeric TbUGP in Escherichia coli
The TbUGP ORF was cloned into a modiﬁed pET15b vector
so that it contains a PreScission™ protease site between the
protein and the His6 tag. This plasmid was expressed in E.
coli and the protein puriﬁed as described in Materials and
methods (Figure 3A). After puriﬁcation by nickel aﬃnity
chromatography, the recombinant TbUGP eluted as a single
peak by gel ﬁltration with a retention time consistent with a
monomeric 55 kDa protein. Protein with the His6 tag removed
by PreScission™ protease also eluted as a monomer by gel ﬁl-
tration, indicating that the N-terminal His6 tag does not
inﬂuence quaternary organization. Since oligomerization has a
key role in the regulation of activity for other UGPs (Martz et al.
2002), UDP-Glc synthetic activity was assayed in each fraction
from gel ﬁltration and this demonstrated that the monomeric
state is active. Furthermore, analysis of the pooled active frac-

molecular weight than the recombinant protein due to the His6 tag, and the faint
band underneath is the heavy chain of IgG used in the immunoprecipitation. The
molecular weight standards (kDa) are shown on the left.

tions of recombinant His6-TbUGP protein by analytical
ultracentrifugation (at 0.75 mL mg/mL) indicated that the major-
ity of TbUGP is monomeric at this concentration (Figure 3B),
although some dimer and possibly higher oligomers were de-
tected. The ultracentrifugation data were unaﬀected by the
presence or absence of UTP and Glc-1-P (data not shown). This
result is in agreement with the data previously published for L.
major and barley UGP, which were also found to be active as
monomers (Martz et al. 2002; Lamerz et al. 2006; Steiner et
al. 2007) but is in contrast with human UGP which is octameric
(Chang et al. 1996).

TbUGP enzyme kinetics and specificity
We measured the TbUGP forward reaction (i.e., the production

using recombinant His6-TbUGP. The reactions were started by
adding the enzyme and stopped by boiling. After adding an
excess of 2 mM NaOH, aliquots of the resulting solutions were
analyzed by anion exchange high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (HPLC), as described in Materials and methods,
allowing the resolution and detection by ultraviolet (UV) ab-
sorbance of UDP-Glc and UTP. Using this method, we
determined the optimal pH for the TbUGP forward reaction
to be between pH 6.0 and 7.5 (Figure 4A) and showed that
TbUGP was, as expected, divalent cation-dependent (with an
optimal assay condition of 10 mM Mg2+). The enzyme could
also be activated by Mn2+ and Co2+, but not by Zn2+ or Cu2+
(data not shown).

The substrate speciﬁcity of TbUGP was also deﬁned with
the HPLC assay using a variety of sugar-1-phosphate sub-

strates (Figure 4B). Using Glc-1-P as a substrate, a single peak
was observed with a retention time of 25.5 min, coeluting with
an authentic UDP-Glc standard. No sugar nucleotide peaks were
observed in the absence of TbUGP or when GalNAc-1-P,
GlcNAc-1-P or Gal-1-P was used as a substrate. These data
showed that Glc-1-P was the preferred substrate of TbUGP un-
der these conditions.

The puriﬁed recombinant TbUGP protein was then kinetical-
ly characterized for the forward reaction using a discontinuous
colorimetric coupled assay (Stokes et al. 2008). In this case, the
PPi product is converted to inorganic phosphate (Pi) by pyro-
phosphatase, and the Pi is subsequently reacted with malachite
green. Using this assay, the speciﬁc activity and apparent Km va-
lues for UTP and Glc-1-P were determined. The linearities of the
Lineweaver–Burke plots showed that the T. brucei enzyme
obeyed simple Michaelis–Menten kinetics for both substrates.
The speciﬁc activity of the recombinant TbUGP was 5.2 ×
104 μmol PPi released/min mg protein, and the apparent Km va-
lues for UTP and Glc-1-P were 53 ± 8 μM and 122 ± 17 μM,
respectively (data not shown). These values of are well within

Subcellular localization of TbUGP in bloodstream form
T. brucei
Localization studies were conducted using aﬃnity-puriﬁed
polyclonal mouse anti-TbUGP antibody together with either
rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody (as a glycosomal marker) or rabbit
anti-enolase (as a cytosolic marker). The secondary antibodies
were anti-mouse Alexa 488 (green) and anti-rabbit Alexa 594
(red). The data show substantial co-localization of the anti-
TbUGP with anti-GAPDH signals (Figure 5A, B, C) and an ab-
sence of co-localization of the anti-TbUGP with anti-enolase
signals (Figure 5E, F, G). These data indicate that TbUGP
localizes to the glycosome microbodies of bloodstream form
T. brucei. Interestingly, although all of the GAPDH-staining gly-
cosomes appear to also contain TbUGP (compare Figure 5A
and B), the ratio of TbUGP to GAPDH staining may be var-
iable. Although the majority of TbUGP staining is glycosomal,
we cannot rule out that some TbUGP may be also present in the
cytosol.

lecular replacement using the L. major UGP/UDP-Glc com-
plex closed conformation structure (Steiner et al. 2007). The
crystallographic statistics related to the structure determination
of TbUGP and its complex with UDP-Glc are listed in Table I.
The asymmetric unit contains two protein chains, labeled A
and B. The crystal contacts between A and B are not substan-
tial. Several crystal contact interfaces are mediated by moieties
from the crystallization buﬀer (i.e., glycerol, PEG, and sulfate),
and thus protein subunit oligomerization is not implied by the
crystallographic data (Figure 6A). Several surface loops and
residues were not modeled due to insuﬃcient electron density.
These include the ﬁrst eight N-terminal residues in both chains
and residues between Asp264 and Gln272 in monomer A. In the
case of monomer B, the areas not modeled are (corresponding to
PDB numbering) B61–B70, B123–124, B266–B271, and the

carboxy-terminal residue B483. Because monomer A is more
complete, we use herein this model for our analysis. Although
the resolution is fairly high, no peaks corresponding to magne-
sium could be found in the electron density.

The TbUGP structure is similar to those of other previously
described eukaryotic UGP structures (Roeben et al. 2006;
McCoy et al. 2007; Steiner et al. 2007). It contains an
N-terminal domain (amino acids Pro2–Thr45, Asn164–Val188,
Pro328–Ala352, green) and a C-terminal domain (Asp388–
Glu485, yellow) ﬂanking the central catalytic domain (red,
Figure 6B). The central catalytic domain forms a Rossman
fold consisting of an eight-stranded mixed beta-sheet, ﬂanked
by an outer layer of helices that then branches oﬀ into the
C-terminal left-handed beta helix (residues 408–485), contain-
ing a strongly hydrophobic core. Density is missing in the

TbUGP data for residues Asp264–Gln272, which are highly
solvent exposed due to crystal packing. This missing area corre-
sponds to a ﬂexible, protruding loop (Arg261–Leu280) also
found in the L. major structure (Figure 6C).

The structure was solved using the “closed” conformation
of LmUGP, and we see that TbUGP is also in the closed con-
formation and appears to be even more ﬁrmly closed onto the
substrate. Structure-based comparison with LmUGP (PDB ac-
cession no. 2OEG) reveals that TbUGP C-terminal domain
(R331–L349) moves an additional 12 degrees towards the cat-
alytic domain pocket compared to the LmUGP in closed
conﬁguration (Figure 6C). The active site is located in the
central catalytic domain, in a pocket with distinctive positive
electrostatic potential (Figure 6D).

The SB loop (Thr251–Gly258) aligns well with LmUGP
which is expected since both structures were obtained in
the presence of UDP-Glc. The NB loop also moves closer to
the substrate pocket, however, less dramatically compared to
the 12 degree motion of the C-terminus lobe. The LBH as well
is compressed in towards the pocket. The overall eﬀect of all
these motions is to occlude the SB pocket, which can be seen
in Figure 6C and D.

Active site of the UDP-Glc complex
The structure of TbUGP in complex with the product of the
forward reaction, UDP-Glc, conﬁrms the location of the active
site of the enzyme (Figure 6B, C, D). TbUGP contains all of
the crucial amino acids that were earlier implicated in catalysis
or SB of UGPs from other eukaryotic species (Chang et al.
1996; Duggleby et al. 1996; McCoy et al. 2007). For instance,
Lys367 of Solanum tuberosum UGP, located in the C-terminal
domain and crucial for catalysis, corresponds to Lys377 in the
T. brucei enzyme.

1624

The UDP-Glc is bound in a deep cleft located at the center
of the catalytic domain that consists of highly conserved resi-
dues. The SB loop (Thr251–Gly258) and the NB loop (Lys82–
Lys97), both located in the central catalytic domain, are well
conserved (Figure 1).

The uridine ring stays parallel to Gly85, Gly86, and Gly191,
which probably ﬁxes the ring by hydrophobic interactions.
Gln163 side chain oxygen and nitrogen also contribute by in-
teraction with the heteroatoms in the ring.

In the case of the ribose ring, O-2 seems to be interacting
with the backbone nitrogen of Gly86 residue, and O-3 is inter-
acting with the backbone nitrogen of Gly221. The rest of the
interactions are involving water molecules so, as proposed for
the L. major structure, analogues of UDP-Glc modiﬁed in the
ribose residue could be inhibitory (Steiner et al. 2007).

The phosphates are ﬁxed by a mixture of hydrogen bonds,
with Lys377 stabilizing both the α-phosphate and the oxygen
in the phosphate diester link. The α-phosphate also interacts
closely with a water molecule and a glycerol that appears in-
side the active site (which is probably replaced by water in
solution). The β-phosphate interactions include several water
molecules, Lys 256 and His192.

The glucose residue is ﬁxed via several hydrogen bonds, as
observed in other UGPs. In this case, the OH-4 of glucose is
involved in three diﬀerent possible interactions, with Gly258
(with both the CO and N from the amide bond) and with
Asn303; the OH-2 interacts with Glu281 and His192.

cribed in Materials and methods.

Coordinate and structure factors for TbUGP in complex with
UDP-Glc have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank

Discussion
UGPs have been puriﬁed and characterized from a wide range of
prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, including Mycobacteri-
um tuberculosis (Lai et al. 2008), Arabidopsis thaliana (McCoy
et al. 2007), and B. taurus (Stevens and Phelps 1976). The eu-
karyotic enzymes have no signiﬁcant sequence similarity to
their prokaryotic counterparts and, whereas other enzymes of
sugar nucleotide metabolism in T. brucei, like UDP-Glc 4′-
epimerase, appear to have a bacterial origin (Roper et al.
2002), TbUGP clearly belongs of the eukaryotic family of UGPs
and no putative bacterial UGP homologues could be found in the
T. brucei genome. The kinetoplastid UGPs belong to their own
phylogenic clade (Lamerz et al. 2006).

There is nothing particularly remarkable about the enzymatic
properties of TbUGP, apart for its strict speciﬁcity for Glc-1-P
which diﬀerentiates it from the UGPs of the parasite’s human
and bovine hosts that can also utilize Gal-1-P for the synthesis
of UDP-Gal (Turnquist et al. 1974). The molecular geometries
observed in the TbUGP crystal structure around the OH-2 and
OH-4 of the glucose residue of bound UDP-Glc are probably

responsible for its strict substrate speciﬁcity. Thus, the tight net-
work of interactions with the OH-4 of the glucose residue
explains why UDP-Gal (an epimer of UDP-Glc at the OH-
4 position) is not a substrate, and the interactions of the
OH-2 of the glucose residue with residues Glu281 and
His192 provide the steric constraints that prevent the bind-
ing of 2-deoxy-2-N-acetamido sugars (as in UDP-GlcNAc and
UDP-GalNAc). The strict sugar-speciﬁc substrate speciﬁcity of
TbUGP is reminiscent of other T. brucei sugar nucleotide
biosynthetic enzymes, for example, TbGalE (UDP-Glc 4′-
epimerase) and TbUAP (UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase)
interconvert and utilize exclusively UDP-Glc/UDP-Gal
(Roper et al. 2005) and GlcNAc-1-P (Stokes et al. 2008),
respectively, whereas their mammalian counterparts can also
interconvert and utilize UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc and
GalNAc-1-P, respectively.

Another diﬀerence between the parasite and human UGPs
relates to quaternary structure: TbUGP, like L. major UGP, is
predominantly monomeric and fully active in its monomeric
state whereas the human enzyme, like that of other mammals
and of fungi, is active as an octamer (Turnquist et al. 1974;

Chang et al. 1996; Roeben et al. 2006). Interestingly, both
AGX1, the extensively characterized dimeric human UDP-
GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (Mio et al. 1998), and Arabidopsis
UGP (McCoy et al. 2007) have a C-terminal domain loop
responsible for dimerization, and in S. cerevisiae UGP, this fea-
ture has been shown to be essential for stabilization of the
octameric active form. The absence of a comparable C-terminal
domain loop in TbUGP may explain its natural monomeric state.
Sequestration by oligomerization has been suggested to be
important in the regulation of UGPs, particularly in plants
(Chen et al. 2007). Other possible methods of regulation in-
clude O-GlcNAc-ylation, as found for human UGP (Wells et
al. 2003), diﬀerences in N-terminal acetylation status, as dem-
onstrated for UGPase isoforms in rice (Chen et al. 2007), and
phosphorylation, as shown by the down-regulation of yeast
UGP by phosphorylation by a serine/threonine kinase (Roeben
et al. 2006). Since cytosolic O-GlcNAc-ylation does not occur
in T. brucei, this may be ruled out as a regulatory mechanism
for TbUGP. Furthermore, a recent analysis of the bloodstream
form T. brucei phosphoproteome (Nett et al. 2009) did not
identify TbUGP as a phosphoprotein (although its low abun-

1625

dance and glycosomal location might have prevented its detec-
tion). It may be that TbUGP and metabolic ﬂux into the UDP-
hexose pathways, like the non-allosteric regulation of glycolysis
(Haanstra et al. 2008), is principally regulated by glycosomal
compartmentation in T. brucei.

Glycosomes of trypanosomatids belong to the microbody
family of organelles, containing the glyoxysomes of plants
and peroxisomes of all other eukaryotes. The organelles resem-
ble each other with respect to morphology and metabolic
functions, but a unique feature of trypanosomatid glycosomes
is their essential role in carbohydrate metabolism, i.e., glycol-
ysis, gluconeogenesis, glycerol metabolism, the pentose-
phosphate pathway (Michels et al. 2006), and much of sugar
nucleotide biosynthesis (Roper et al. 2002; Turnock et al.
2007; Stokes et al. 2008), including TbUGP (this paper).
Glycosomal proteins are targeted to these organelles via a per-
oxisomal targeting sequence (PTS), which can be located in the
C-terminus (PTS-1) or N-terminus (PTS-2) of the protein. Inter-
nal PTS sequences have also been proposed as another targeting
mechanism, with T. cruzi phosphoglucomutase as an example
(Penha et al. 2009). TbUGP does not contain traditional try-
panosome PTS sequences (Opperdoes and Szikora 2006).
However, several internal PTS-1-like sequences can be found,
such as -NRV- (N164–V166), -GKL- (G203–L205), -SNG-
(S219–G221), or -SDL- (S380–L382). Of these four se-
quences, SNG is in the active site, and only GKL seems to be
exposed to the solvent in the crystal structure. Nevertheless, con-
sidering that the apo-structure will be diﬀerent to the protein in
complex with UDP-Glc (Steiner et al. 2007), none of these
sequences can be discounted until appropriate mutagenesis ex-
periments are performed. In cases where no targeting sequence
exists, it has been proposed that proteins can traﬃc to the glyco-
some by “piggybacking” on other PTS-targeted proteins
(Purdue and Lazarow 2001; Titorenko et al. 2002). One such
candidate for TbUGP is UDP-Glc 4′-epimerase, TbGalE, which
has a TKL C-terminal PTS-1 sequence and which works in part-
nership with TbUGP in the biosynthesis of UDP-Gal (Roper et
al. 2002). In any case, it would now appear that all enzymes
involved in the UDP-hexose biosynthetic pathway exist in the
glycosome, since hexokinase (Glc → Glc-6-P), TbUGP
(Glc-1-P → UDP-Glc), and TbGalE (UDP-Glc ↔ UDP-Gal)
have all been experimentally localized there. The only missing
link is the identity and location of the T. brucei phosphoglucose
mutase (Glc-6-P → Glc-1-P) activity, for which there is no ob-
vious candidate gene in T. brucei, although the T. cruzi enzyme
has been identiﬁed and localized to glycosomes (Penha et al.
2009). The fact that UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, and UDP-GlcNAc
are all synthesized in the glycosome and used in the ER and/
or nucleus reinforces the hypothesis that glycosomal sugar nu-
cleotide transporters and/or antiporters may exist (Stokes et al.
2008).

The related parasite L. major has a salvage pathway where-
by it can take up galactose and convert it, via galactokinase and
Isselbacher pathway UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase, to UDP-
Gal (Damerow et al. 2010). In contrast, this salvage pathway
is completely absent in T. brucei, and the organism is entirely
dependent on the de novo synthesis of UDP-Gal for glycopro-
tein biosynthesis (Roper et al. 2002; Urbaniak et al. 2006). We
may therefore assume that TbUGP, which provides UDP-Glc
for epimerization to UDP-Gal, is also essential and a potential

1626

drug target for human African sleeping sickness. Indeed,
TbUGP may be a superior target to the TbGalE epimerase be-
cause UDP-Glc is also required as the glucosyl donor for the
UGGT and for the synthesis of base J (β-D-glucosylhydroxy-
methyluracil) (van Leeuwen et al. 1998; Izquierdo et al. 2009).
The crystal structure of TbUGP described here will help in the
design of TbUGP inhibitors and in assessing their modes of
binding. The therapeutic potential of TbUGP as a drug target
will obviously depend on our ability to ﬁnd drug-like parasite-
speciﬁc TbUGP inhibitors.

Materials and methods
DNA isolation and manipulation
Plasmid DNA was puriﬁed from E. coli (DH5α) using the Qia-
gen Miniprep or Maxiprep kit as appropriate. Gel extraction
was performed using QIAquick kits. Custom oligonucleotides
were obtained from the University of Dundee oligonucleotide
facility. T. brucei genomic DNA was isolated from 1 × 108
bloodstream form cells using DNAzol (Helena Biosciences,
Gateshead, UK). All T. brucei cell cultures are mycoplasma free.

Cloning and sequencing of TbUGP
The TbUGP open reading frame identiﬁed in the T. brucei ge-
nome database (Tb10.389.0330) was ampliﬁed by PCR from
genomic DNAwith Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using a forward primer containing an
NdeI site (underlined), 5′-ggaattccatatgccgctaaaccctcc-3′, and a
reverse primer containing a XhoI site (underlined), 5′-cgcctcgagc-
tactcgactaccacaacct-3′. The products of three separate PCR
reactions were cloned into a modiﬁed pET15B (Invitrogen) vec-
tor with a PreScission™ protease site replacing the thrombin
cleavage site (a kind gift of Jon Urch and Daan van Aalten, Col-
lege of Life Sciences, University of Dundee), and a representative
clone from each PCR was sequenced in both directions. All three
clones were identical.

The TbUGP sequence was also obtained when the gene was
ampliﬁed from cDNA using the same TbUGP 3′-primer and a
5′-spliced leader primer 5′-gcccgctattattagaacagtttctgta-3′.

All plasmids were veriﬁed by sequencing (DNA Sequencing
Service, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee; www.
dnaseq.co.uk).

RT–PCR
Total RNA from bloodstream form (BSF) and procyclic form
(PCF) T. brucei was extracted using the RNAeasy extraction kits
with on-column DNAse digestion (RNAse-free DNAse; Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). RNA samples were treated with Omniscript re-
verse transcriptase (Qiagen) to generate cDNA. The cDNAs
were then ampliﬁed by PCR using Taq polymerase and TbUGP
ORF primers (described in Cloning and sequencing of TbUGP)
and Dol-P-Man synthetase primers (forward 5′-aatggatgcggacctt-
cagcacccac-3′, reverse 5′-tagaaccgtgagcgcggtgccatac-3′) as a
constitutively expressed positive control.

Protein expression and purification
The aforementioned modiﬁed pET15B plasmid containing the
TbUGP ORF was used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells.
Selected clones were grown aerobically at 37°C in Lysogeny

broth (LB) medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) to a
culture density of OD 0.6. The expression of His6-TbUGP
was induced by adding isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mM. Cells were grown
overnight at 16°C and harvested by centrifugation. The E. coli
cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.7), 0.15 M
NaCl (buﬀer A), containing 50 mM imidazole, 1 mg/mL ly-
sozyme, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets
(Roche Diagnosis, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). After lysis
in a French press, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation
(20,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C) and the supernatant passed through
a 0.45-μm ﬁlter. Puriﬁcation of His6-TbUGP was performed us-
ing a 5-mL His-Trap column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden)
previously equilibrated with 30 mL of buﬀer A containing
50 mM imidazole. After sample loading, the column was
washed and His6-TbUGP eluted by application of a 50–
350-mM imidazole gradient (AKTA puriﬁer, GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden). The fractions obtained were checked by so-
dium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE), and those containing His6-TbUGP were pooled
and concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator (Sartorius Stedi,
UK Ltd., Epson, UK 10 kDa molecular weight cut oﬀ) at 4°C.
As a second step, recombinant His6-TbUGP was loaded onto a
Superdex 200 HR30 HPLC column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden). Proteins were eluted at 0.5 mL/min in buﬀer A and
monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions (2 mL) were col-
lected and the presence of His6-TbUGP in peak fractions
veriﬁed by SDS–PAGE. The ﬁnal yield was 10 mg/L culture.
After gel ﬁltration, His6-TbUGP can be stored at −80% in buﬀer
A, 10% glycerol for several months. To cleave the His6 tag, the
fusion protein was digested with GST-PreScission protease (a
kind gift of Daan Van Aalten, University of Dundee) in
50 mM Tris pH 7.7, 0.150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT) for 16 h at 4°C. Recombinant proteins were identiﬁed in
the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility, College of Life
Sciences, University of Dundee.

For crystallization, TbUGP was cloned into a modiﬁed
pET15b vector containing a TEV protease site and transformed
into E. coli BL21(DE3)-V2R-pRARE2 cells. Selected cells
were inoculated into 10 mL of LB with ampicillin/chloramphen-
icol (50 μg/mL and 25 μg/mL, respectively) and incubated with
shaking at 250 rpm overnight at 37°C. The culture was trans-
ferred into 50 mL of TB with 50 μg/mL ampicillin in a
250-mL shaking ﬂask and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Then the
culture was transferred into 1.8 L of TB with 50 μg/mL kanamy-
cin and 0.3 mL of antifoam (Sigma, Dorset, UK) and cultured
using the LEX system (Harbinger Biotechnology and Engineer-
ing, Ontario Canada) to an OD600 of ~5, induced with 0.5 mM
IPTG overnight at 15°C and harvested by centrifugation. Pellets
were resuspended in binding buﬀer (50 mM 4-(2-hydro-
xyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES] pH 7.5,
500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 5% glycerol) with the ad-
dition of protease inhibitors (1 mM benzamidine and 1 mM
phenylmethyl sulfonyl ﬂuoride). Prior to mechanical lysis, each
pellet from 1 L of culture was pretreated with 0.5% 3-([3-cho-
lamidopropyl]-dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate and
500 units of benzonase for 30 min at room temperature. Cells
were mechanically lysed with a microﬂuidizer (Microﬂuidizer
Processor, M-110EH), and the cell lysate was centrifuged using
a Beckman JA-25.50 rotor at ~75,000 × g (24,000 rpm) for

Trypanosoma brucei UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase

20 min at 10°C. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a column
pre-packed with 10 g DE52 (Whatman) anion exchange resin
(previously activated with 2.5 M NaCl and equilibrated with
binding buﬀer), and subsequently onto a 3-mL Ni-NTA (Qiagen)
column pre-equilibrated with binding buﬀer. After the lysate was
loaded, the DE52 was further washed with 20 mL of binding
buﬀer. The Ni-NTA column was then washed with 200 mL
of wash buﬀer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl,
30 mM imidazole, and 5% glycerol) at 2–2.5 mL/min. After
washing, the protein was eluted with 15 mL of an elution buﬀ-
er (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM
imidazole, and 5% glycerol). To remove the His6 tag, the protein
was treated with TEV protease and dialysed in 10 mM HEPES,
500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 5 mM DTT overnight. The
sample was passed through the Ni-NTA column one more time
before being loaded onto a Sephadex S200 26/60 gel ﬁltration
column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5 and 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT. The collected fractions
corresponding to the correct eluted protein peak were concentrat-
ed using a 15-mL Amicon Ultra centrifugal ﬁlter device
(Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Analytical ultracentrifugation
Recombinant TbUGP (0.75 mg/mL in buﬀer A) was analyzed
by sedimentation velocity using a Beckman Optima XL-1 Ana-
lytical Ultracentrifuge with an AN50-Ti rotor at 32,000 rpm at
20°C. Absorbance data (72 scans at 280 nm) were collected and
analyzed using the SEDFIT program (Schuck 2004). TbUGP
was assumed to be globular, and its density was predicted from
its amino acid composition.

UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase activity assays
Two methods were used to assay TbUGP, an HPLC assay and
a discontinuous coupled colorimetric assay, as previously des-
cribed for T. brucei UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (Stokes
et al. 2008).

Brieﬂy, the HPLC assay used 0.05 μg His6-TbUGP incubated
in 100 μL of the HPLC assay buﬀer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.2,
250 μM UTP, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 250 μM Glc-1-P) for
8 min, terminated by boiling for 5 min. The samples were diluted
in 2 mM NaOH and analyzed using a Dionex high-pH anion ex-
change chromatography HPLC system. To determine substrate
speciﬁcity, Glc-1-P was substituted by Gal-1-P, GlcNAc-1-P, or
GalNAc-1-P (all at 250 μM). For metal ion dependence, MgCl2
was replaced with CuCl2, ZnCl2, CoCl2, or MnCl2. For pH de-
pendence, the Tris–HCl buﬀer was replaced with a 50-mM
sodium acetate for pH 4.0–6.0 and 50-mM N-cyclohexyl-3-ami-
nopropanesulfonic acid buﬀer for pH higher than 9.0.

The TbUGP colorimetric assay was performed with
0.0125 μg of His6-TbUGP in a 96-well plate format (Nunc™)
in 12.5 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.2, NaCl 150 mM, 500 μM UTP,
500 μM Glc-1-P, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, bovine serum al-
bumin (BSA) 0.1 mg/mL, and 1 U/mL pyrophosphatase
(Sigma) to a ﬁnal volume of 50 μL. The reaction was left for
8 min at room temperature and terminated by the addition of
100 μL of the color reagent (0.2% ammonium molybdate,
0.5% Triton X-100, 0.7 N HCl, 0.03% malachite green). Absor-
bance at 620 nm was measured after 20 min using a SpectraMax
340 PC (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

TbUGP localization
Two Balb/c adult mice were used to raise polyclonal antibodies
against His6-tagged TbUGP protein (about 0.1 mg per mouse)
with Freund’s complete adjuvant. Each mouse received two
further immunizations with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant
over 2 months. Antibodies were then aﬃnity puriﬁed on
CNBr-Sepharose-immobilized TbUGP that had had its His6
tag removed with PreScission™ protease. Similar protocol
was used to immunize two New Zealand rabbits with 0.5 mg
of puriﬁed TbUGP protein per animal.

Wild-type bloodstream form T. brucei cells were grown in
HMI-9 medium to a density of 1 × 106 cells/mL, harvested by
centrifugation and resuspended in trypanosome dilution buﬀer
(0.1 M Na2HPO4, 0.01 M NaH2PO4, 0.025 M KCl, 0.4 M NaCl,
5 mM MgSO4, 0.1 M glucose adjusted to pH 7.45 with HCl) to a
density of 4 × 107 cells/mL. Aliquots (15 μL) were added to
13 mm coverslips, left at 4°C for 15 min, and ﬁxed in 1 mL
4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) for
30 min followed by three 5-min washes in 2 mL PBS. Cells were
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at
room temperature. Samples were then blocked in 5% ﬁsh skin
gelatin (FSG) in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum.
The coverslips were incubated with immunopuriﬁed mouse
anti-TbUGP (0.5 μg/mL) and rabbit anti-glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antiserum at 1:2000 dilu-
tion or rabbit anti-enolase antiserum at 1:4000 dilution in 1%
FSG in PBS, 0.05% TX-100. Both anti-GAPDH and anti-
enolase were kind gifts of Paul Michels (Catholic University
of Louvain). Samples were then washed as above in PBS and
incubated with 50 μL of Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse
IgG and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. Cover-
slips were mounted on glass slides, sealed with Hydromount
containing 2.5% DABCO and left to dry in the dark for
30 min. Microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM 510 META
confocal microscope.

Immunoprecipitation and western blotting of TbUGP
T. brucei bloodstream form cells (2 × 108 cells) puriﬁed from
rat infected blood were washed with trypanosome dilution
buﬀer and hypotonically lysed in 200 μL of water containing
0.1 mM 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone and
1 μg/mL leupeptin. The lysate was adjusted to ﬁnal concentra-
tions of 0.03% SDS and 1% Triton X-100, and an EDTA-free
protease inhibitor tablet (Roche) was added, incubated at 4°C
for 15 min and centrifuged (20,000 × g for 30 min). The pellet
was discarded and the supernatant was incubated (2 h, 4°C)
with 12 μg of aﬃnity-puriﬁed rabbit anti-TbUGP previously
coupled to 50 μL of 30 mg/mL protein G Dynabeads (Invitro-
gen). The beads were recovered by placing on the magnet for
2 min and washed three times with cold 20 mM Tris–HCl pH
7.2, 0.15 M NaCl, containing 0.03% SDS and 1% Triton
X-100. The bound antigen was eluted with 50 mM sodium
citrate pH 2.8 and immediately neutralized with 1.2 M Tris–
HCl pH 8.8. The elution was boiled in SDS-sample buﬀer
containing 0.1 M DTT, loaded onto 4–12% gradient NuPage
gel (Invitrogen) for SDS–PAGE, and western blotted onto ni-
trocellulose. Brieﬂy, the membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v)
BSA, 0.05% (w/v) Tween-20 (Sigma), 0.15 M NaCl in 50 mM
Tris–HCl pH 7.4, and subsequently probed with 5 μg/mL
aﬃnity-puriﬁed mouse anti-TbUGP as the primary antibody,

1628

washed and then incubated with 1:10,000 horse radish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunore-
search, Stratech, Newmarket Suﬀolk, UK). After washing,
the membrane was developed by chemiluminescent detection
(ECL-plus, GE Healthcare).

Crystallization and data collection
Crystals of TbUGP were obtained from a hanging drop vapori-
zation method consisting of 17 mg/mL protein mixed one to
one with a crystallization buﬀer of 22% PEG 3350, 0.1 M am-
monium sulfate, and 0.1 M Bis–Tris pH 5.5. Crystals were
ﬂash-cooled in crystallization buﬀer supplemented with 18%
glycerol.

X-ray diﬀraction data were collected on a home source
Rigaku FRE with wavelength 1.5418 Å. An initial native data-
set was collected using the Rigaku software then indexed and
scaled using the HKL2000 package (Otwinowski et al. 2003).
A molecular replacement solution was found using the program
BALBES (Long et al. 2008), which found a solution using a
model from the UPG-bound form of UGP from L. major
(PDB accession no. 2OEG-A). This initial dataset was partially
twinned and subsequent reﬁnement statistics were poor. Addi-
tional crystals were screened and a second dataset was collected
on a less pathogenic crystal. The BALBES model was used
again and reﬁnement statistics with this dataset were much
improved. The ﬁnal model was built by iterative rounds of
manual model building in Coot (Emsley and Cowtan 2004)
followed by reﬁnement in the ccp4 program refmac5.2
(Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994). The
ﬁnal model has overall good geometry, with 98% of all residues
favored Ramachandran regions and no outliers. Coordinates and
structure factors have been deposited to the RCSB protein data-
bank (PDB accession no. 3GUE). Final statistics are shown in
Table I. Ligand interactions, close contacts, and oligomerization
state within the crystal were analyzed using the program PISA
(Krissinel and Henrick 2007) and crystal ﬁgures created with the
Pymol package (DeLano 2005).
