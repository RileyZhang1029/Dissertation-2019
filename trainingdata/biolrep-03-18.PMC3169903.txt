Abstract
Research aimed at understanding amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has seen exceptional growth in
the past few years. New genes, new models, and new mechanisms have not only improved our
understanding, but also contributed to the increasing complexity of ALS pathogenesis. The focus
of this piece is to highlight some of the more notable developments in the field and to encourage a
re-appreciation for the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mouse models.

Introduction
In 1869, the French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot
described a fatal and progressive paralysis known as
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This devastating
neurodegenerative disease, also known as Lou Gehrig’s
disease (USA) or motor neuron disease (UK), has an
incidence of 2–3 cases per 100,000 annually. In the
United States, 25,000 patients are predicted to be
affected at any one time, with only 50% of patients
surviving 2–3 years after diagnosis. Patients experience
muscle weakness and atrophy, leading to inevitable
paralysis, due to the selective and progressive loss of
motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord that is
characteristic of the disease [1,2]. Most often, patients
succumb to the disease because of denervation of
muscles involved in respiration. Despite decades of
research, we have yet to identify the “silver bullet” to
cure, or even slow, the disease. There is only one
therapeutic option for patients, riluzole, which offers a
modest 3- to 6-month extension in survival [3,4]. The
current lack of effective therapeutic options for patients
is due, in part, to the general lack of understanding of
how the disease initiates and progresses. However, in
the past
there have been a significant
number of advances that are expected to shed new
light on this disease.

few years,

A total of 10% of all ALS cases are genetically inherited,
while the remaining 90% have no known cause [1]. Of
the familial cases, mutations in the gene encoding
superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), one of the three super-
oxide dismutases responsible for destroying free super-
oxide radicals in the body, first described in 1993, are
the most common [5]. So, it is not surprising that the bulk
of research has focused on examining the consequences of
pathogenic SOD1 mutations in a variety of models. Some
researchers believe, maybe too cynically, that the inability
to find an effective therapy is because the field relies too
heavily on SOD1 mouse models; this cynicism stems from
the fact that only a subset of ALS cases are due to
mutations in this particular gene. Regardless, using SOD1
animal models, scientists have pushed the field forward by
dissecting out a variety of molecular events in affected
motor neurons [6].

New genes
In the past 3 years, two novel genes have emerged on the
scene, bringing with them a new, previously little-
considered mechanism of RNA metabolism and proces-
sing. The protein products of these new genes, TARDBP
(encoding TAR DNA binding protein-43, or TDP-43) and
FUS (also known as TLS, which encodes RNA-binding
protein FUS), are known to participate in a multitude of

functions [7]. While these two genes appear (at first
blush) to implicate very different mechanisms than those
identified using the SOD1 models, much work remains
to be done to define the pathogenic mechanism(s)
affected by these mutations. In the meantime, there has
been a veritable stampede in the development of animal
models to investigate these new genes. How, and if, these
different genetic causes converge on the selective killing
of motor neurons in ALS, yielding a more or less
clinically indistinguishable phenotype, is an important
question in the field. Identifying the common link
between them is a major research focus as this intersec-
tion would be expected to be an ideal therapeutic target.
Mutations in a third gene, OPTN (which encodes the
protein optineurin, reported to be involved in protein
trafficking, autophagy, and gene expression) are known
to be causative for primary open-angle glaucoma, and
have also been recently implicated in ALS. While the role
for OPTN in ALS is not yet clear, several mutations have
been found in both Japanese and Italian ALS patients,
the latter cohort including both familial and sporadic
cases [8-11]. For TDP-43 and FUS, their discoveries have
raised the very real possibility that RNA metabolism and
processing is a central feature in neurodegeneration,
including ALS. Of course, RNA metabolism and proces-
sing is a broad term that implies a wide range of cellular
activities. To some extent, however, the field is expecting
to see additional RNA-binding proteins surface in ALS,
but the negative result of a recent mutational analysis for
a FUS/TLS family member, TAF15, has dampened such
expectations [12]. On the other hand, defects in the gene
encoding the RNA-binding protein SMN1 (survival of
motor neuron 1) have long been known in spinal
muscular atrophy, a juvenile disease that is characterized
by the loss of spinal cord motor neurons in young
children [13].

In the case of TDP-43 mutations, a recent major advance
is the identification of the target transcripts bound by
TDP-43 [14-17]. However, despite the plethora of
potential TDP-43 regulatable transcripts that
these
approaches have yielded, the field is a long way from
understanding the biology. And surprisingly, despite
widespread prediction, as yet
there has been no
convincing demonstration that either TDP-43 or FUS
mutants alter
the splicing pattern of any known
transcripts. However, both have been localized to, and
implicated in, the formation and regulation of stress
granules, which is a normal cellular
response to
exogenous stress stimuli [18-24], and there is significant
speculation that this pathway, not previously implicated
in ALS, may be a factor in the disease. Another piece of
evidence for this comes from studies showing that
recognized markers of stress granules colocalize with

TDP-43 and FUS inclusions in postmortem patient
material [20,25].

Likely one of the most exciting recent developments in
ALS research is the identification of genes that can
modify aspects of
the disease. While disease gene
modifiers, alleles/genes that either are associated with a
higher than normal risk of developing the disease in the
population or modify the onset and/or duration of the
disease, have been reported in other disease contexts, few
such examples were known to exist for ALS. Some years
back, an association was reported between a marker
influencing KIFAP3 expression and patient survival;
KIFAP3 (kinesin-associated protein 3) participates with
the motor protein kinesin in the movement of organelles
and molecules towards the neuromuscular junction [26].
However, an independent
follow-up study did not
confirm this association [27]. Conversely and most
recently, ATXN2 (encoding ataxin-2), known to cause
spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, was linked to ALS in several
different studies [28-32]. Specifically,
intermediate
length expansions of ataxin-2’s polyglutamine repeats
(27-33 glutamines) are found in ALS patients. Intrigu-
ingly, the possibility that this locus could be implicated
in ALS was presented 3 years ago using a very different
genetic approach [33]. What is exciting here is that the
recent emergence of ATXN2 is akin to the identification
of APOE (encoding apolipoprotein E) allele e4, which
confers an increased risk in Alzheimer’s disease [34]. And
as we have seen for APOE in Alzheimer’s disease, the
biology behind the ATXN2 association in ALS is certain
to be an area of intense investigation.

The implication of ATXN2 in ALS, as well as in
spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, highlights the recent
general acknowledgement that there is genetic overlap
between neurodegenerative diseases. Most recently,
mutations in the gene encoding valosin-containing
protein (VCP), previously identified as causative for
both frontotemporal dementia [35] and the rare
syndrome IBMPFD (inclusion body myopathy with
early-onset Paget disease of the bone and frontotemporal
dementia) [36], were described in a cohort of ALS
patients using exome sequencing [37]. The idea that ALS
and frontotemporal dementia might share some com-
mon pathways was raised in 2006, when TDP-43 was
identified as a major component of neuronal aggregates
that figure significantly in the pathology of patients with
ALS or frontotemporal dementia [38] and, clinically, the
association between ALS and frontotemporal dementia
has been recognized for more than a decade [39]. This
overlap was further reinforced by the identification of
TDP-43 mutations in frontotemporal dementia patients
without ALS features [40,41]. Thus, it is now widely

believed that ALS and frontotemporal dementia are part
of a disease spectrum. It is evident that genes such as
ALS2, SETX, and VAPB, which are thought to cause
familial forms of ALS, may be allelic for, or implicated in,
other neurological diseases. As our genetic understand-
ing of ALS advances, what has become very apparent is
that SOD1 mutations have never been reported in any
other disease. So is the SOD1 mouse model really so
bad? Wouldn’t a purely ALS-causing gene be the ideal
choice with which to dissect mechanism(s) and develop
therapeutics?

New models and mechanisms
This brings us back to the utility of the SOD1 mouse
models. As alluded to earlier,
these models have
uncovered several biological mechanisms thought to
actively participate in the selective motor neuron
degeneration characteristic of ALS (please see [6] for a
recent comprehensive review). Of these possibilities,
there has been a considerable focus on mitochondria,
specialized organelles that are primarily responsible for
meeting the energy demands of the power-hungry motor
neurons, and how SOD1 might affect their normal
function. This focus on mitochondria is due in large part
to the observation that SOD1 preferentially associates
with mitochondria from affected spinal cords but less so,
if at all, with mitochondria from other tissues [42-44].
This work has developed in parallel with a series of
groups developing tools designed to specifically recog-
nize a disease-specific conformation of SOD1 [45-47].
Using these tools, it is now recognized that a misfolded
form of SOD1 does exist and it is found to be bound to
the mitochondrial surface [44,48]. Thus, it fits well that
further investigation has found that mitochondrial
functions at the surface, such as protein import [49]
and metabolite conductance [48], are disrupted by the
presence of misfolded SOD1. Other aspects of mito-
chondrial function may also be affected, as significant
changes in axonal mitochondrial morphology have
recently been reported in two different mutant SOD1
models [50]. What remains to be clarified is the sequence
of these events in disease development. Regardless, it is
significant (and exciting) that a misfolded form of SOD1
can be detected in the motor neurons of some sporadic
ALS patients who lack a genetic mutation in SOD1
[47,51]. One possible explanation for this may come
from recent studies showing that the wild type SOD1
protein can become mutant-like in vitro through oxida-
tion [52,53]. Together, these findings firmly link SOD1
to sporadic disease and reinforce the utility of the SOD1
animal models.

However, it is surely true that other genes might exist that
modify the disease in humans. Using the power of mouse

genetics, a recent report using the well-characterized ALS
model of mice expressing SOD1 with a glycine to alanine
mutation (G93A) bred into multiple different genetic
backgrounds yielded several disease modifying loci [54].
The timing of disease onset and the progression/duration
of the disease was variable in the different backgrounds.
While much additional work needs to be done, an
exciting list of candidate genes will undoubtedly emerge
from these studies.

true for the SOD1 models. In fact, of all

The ultimate goal of every ALS research team is to define
how the disease starts and progresses so that we can craft
a therapeutic to halt the disease. To do this, we need to
have confidence in our animal models. While the
TARDBP and FUS/TLS mice are ways away from
demonstrating their true utility in this regard, this is
not
the
neurodegenerative disease models, the mutant SOD1
mice are some of the most faithful mimics of human
disease. So why have the dozens (if not hundreds) of
clinical trials in ALS not yet yielded our “silver bullet”? Is
it poor preclinical trial design? Unrealistic expectations/
outcome measures for patients in clinical trials? Both of
these have recently been addressed by the field in the
revamped way SOD1 mouse models are to be used in the
preclinical evaluation of potential therapeutics. This is
summarized nicely in the recently developed ALS mouse
handbook [55]. The implementation of these consensus
guidelines should hopefully avoid erroneous interpreta-
tions and thus rationalize the choice of therapeutics
pushed forward into Phase I/II human trials. At the
patient level, there has been a significant paradigm shift
with regards to trial design. Improvements to patient
quality of life are now considered to be more important
and/or indicative of success than time of survival. Such
new designs are also more attractive to potential patients
enrolling in the trial [56].

Conclusion
In a relatively short period of time, the ALS field has
acquired a remarkable amount of information about the
potential cellular mechanisms underlying the disease.
The challenge lying ahead is how to integrate and
assimilate the recent and emerging data to identify
common mechanisms as these will likely represent the
best potential targets for future therapies. However, let’s
suppose for a moment that we don’t get that. What if we
find a handful of targets without finding the unifier?
Perhaps we should start
the discussion now about
personalized patient care? Given the stochastic nature
of ALS, the variability in age and site of onset, the
inherited and noninherited forms, perhaps it is naïve to
think that a “one size fits all” approach will benefit every
ALS patient. Perhaps customized, combination therapies

should be our goal? Maybe we should be thinking in
terms of finding the “silver bullets”, not “bullet”.
