Previous studies indicated that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706 in the gene ZNF804A encoding zinc ﬁnger protein 804A was associated with schizophrenia in Caucasian population but not in Chi- nese Han population.
However, current results are conﬂicting in Asian population.
In the present study, a meta-analysis was performed to revisit the association between rs1344706 and the risk of schizophrenia in Asian, Caucasian and other populations.
Electronic search of PubMed database iden- tiﬁed 25 case control studies with available genotype frequencies of rs1344706 for the meta-analysis, involving a total of 15,788 cases and 22,654 controls.
A pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) was used to assess the association.
The current meta-analysis showed an association between rs1344706 and schizophrenia in Caucasian populations (P = 0.028, OR = 1.138, 95% CI: 1.014 1.278  P = 0.004 for heterogeneity) and Asian populations (P = 0.008, OR = 1.092, 95% CI: 1.023 1.165  P = 0.001 for heterogeneity), but not in other populations (P = 0.286, OR = 1.209, 95% CI: 0.853 1.714, P = 0.120 for heterogeneity).
Egger s test (P   0.05) and Begg s test (P   0.05) are both suggestive of the lack of publication bias for the included studies.
Thus, the absence of association in other populations suggests a genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility of schizo- phrenia and demonstrates the difﬁculties in replicating genome-wide association study ﬁndings regarding schizophrenia across different ethnic populations.
To validate the association between rs1344706 and schizophrenia, further studies with larger participant populations worldwide are needed.

Many studies based on families, twins and adopted individuals have consistently demonstrated the impor- tance of genetic factors and of the combination of environmental and genetic factors to the etiology of schizophrenia, among which heritability estimates are approximately 80% [2 4].
Genetic variants in the gene ZNF804A have been found to be associated with schizophrenia in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) [5].
In particular, the intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706 (A/C) has been associated with schizophrenia in several studies, with the A allele being the risk allele [5 8].
ZNF804A (OMIM: 612282) is located on chromosome 2q32.1 and consists of 4 exons and 3 introns [6].
ZNF804A encodes zinc ﬁnger protein 804A, which con- tains a C2H2-type zinc ﬁnger domain, and is distributed throughout the human brain especially in the developing med- ial temporal lobe and brain cortices [9 11].
Proteins with zinc ﬁnger domains play a variety of roles, including binding to DNA, transcriptional regulation, gene expression and DNA  protein interactions [10,12,13].
However, the exact functions of ZNF804A remain unknown [11].
Some studies suggested that rs1344706 may be associated with brain structure and  function [14 16].
To further explore whether the risk allele A of rs1344706 would increase the risk of schizophrenia in differ- ent populations, the present meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association between rs1344706 and the risk of schizophrenia in Asian, Caucasian and other populations.
Results  Eligible studies  A total of 25 studies that reported the association between rs1344706 and schizophrenia were identiﬁed from the literature and included in this meta-analysis (Figure 1), including 15,788 schizophrenia cases and 22,654 controls.
The detailed charac- teristics of eligible studies are summarized in Table 1.
Meta analysis  The evaluation of the association between rs1344706 and the heterogeneity test is shown in Table 2.

and Asian populations  Publication bias  The main purpose of meta-analysis is to extract information from published studies.
However, selective publication of stud- ies in a meta-analysis could lead to bias in the conclusions [35,36].
Therefore, Egger s test and Begg s test were performed to evaluate whether there exists publication bias in the previ- ous studies on schizophrenia selected for this meta-analysis.
As shown in Table 2, the P values from Egger s test and Begg s test for publication bias were in the range 0.058 0.92, which are all above the signiﬁcance threshold.
These data indicate  no publication bias (P   0.05 for both) for the studies included for the meta-analysis, which is further evidenced by the symmetry of the funnel plot as shown in Figure 2.
Discussion  Several SNPs such as rs1344706, rs4667001 and rs728534 in ZNF804A have been associated with schizophrenia in a GWAS of European population in 2008 [5].
Later on, three independent laboratories also demonstrated that rs1344706 in ZNF804A was associated with schizophrenia in European populations [37 39].
However, a previous meta-analysis sug- gested that rs1344706 is not associated with schizophrenia in Chinese Han population [40].
Thus, further studies are neces- sary to explore whether the risk allele A of rs1344706 would increase the risk of schizophrenia in different populations.
Our present meta-analysis showed that rs1344706 is associated with schizophrenia in both Caucasian (P = 0.028) and Asian populations in other populations (P = 0.286).
Two studies were classiﬁed as   others  , including  (P = 0.008), but not   Zhu M et al / ZNF804A and Schizophrenia  295  1.0  0.5  R O  0 1 g o L  0  -0.5  0  0.1  0.2  0.3  Standard error of log10OR  Figure 2 Begg s funnel plot for meta-analysis of rs1344706 The funnel plot is a scatter plot testing publication bias by determining if there is a signiﬁcant correlation between the estimated effect sizes and their variances.

one performed by Wassink et al.
in the United States [33] since the components of the study population were not described in the report.
The other study is on Turkish population [34], since we cannot determine whether Turkish belongs to Asian population or Caucasian population.
Our data agree well with the reported association of rs1344706 with the Caucasian.
Nonetheless, these data are inconsistent with the previous study in Chinese populations.
Such discrepancy could be explained by the number of studies included for Asian popula- tions.
In their report, Li et al.
[40] included 8 studies (8982 cases and 12,342 controls) while we have 13 studies (11,297 cases and 14,679 controls) in the present meta-analysis, which included not only Chinese population but also other Asian populations like Japanese, Singaporeans and Indonesian.
The difference in association of rs1344706 with schizophrenia between Caucasian, Asian and other populations may be due to the genetic heterogeneity of different ethnic populations [26].
The current ﬁndings suggest that genetic associations observed in complex psychiatric disorders may not be general- izable to different populations.
Several studies have suggested that intelligence quotient (IQ) may modulate the association between ZNF804A gene polymorphism and cognitive function in schizophrenia patients [24,27].
Therefore, IQ may be a con- founding factor and may modulate the association between rs1344706 and schizophrenia in other populations, which might explain our failure to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association between rs1344706 and schizophrenia in other populations.
Further association studies with more patients from more eth- nic background would be required to determine the details.
Materials and methods  Literature search  The PubMed database was surveyed using search terms   ZNF804A  ,   SNP   and   schizophrenia   (the last search  update was on May 14, 2014).
Case control studies with geno- type frequencies of rs1344706 available were chosen without language restrictions.
Additional studies were identiﬁed using review articles and manual searches of the reference section of original studies.
Statistical analysis  The strength of association between rs1344706 and schizophre- nia was assessed by calculating crude additive ORs and 95% CIs for each study.
The pooled ORs were calculated based on an additive genetic model (A allele vs. C allele).
Due to the signiﬁcant heterogeneity observed between studies (P = 0.001 for heterogeneity in Asian, and P = 0.004 for het- erogeneity in Caucasian), the random effects model was used to calculate the pooled ORs.
Publication bias was examined using Begg s test rank corre- lation method (funnel plot method) and Egger s weighted regression method (P   0.05 was considered signiﬁcant) [35,36].
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata soft- ware (version 9.0  STATA Corporation, College Station, TX).
