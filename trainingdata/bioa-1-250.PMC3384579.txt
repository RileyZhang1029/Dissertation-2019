polar  residues  lying  between  adjacent  α-helical  chains  of  coiled-coils  often  contribute  to  coiled-coil  curvature  and 
flexibility,  while  more  typical  core  hydrophobic  residues  anneal  the  chains  together.  In  tropomyosins,  ranging  from 
smooth and skeletal muscle to cytoplasmic isoforms, a highly conserved Asp at residue 137 places negative charges within 
the tropomyosin coiled-coil core in a position which may affect the conformation needed for tropomyosin binding and 
regulatory movements on actin. proteolytic susceptibility suggested that substituting a canonical Leu for the naturally 
occurring Asp at residue 137 increases inter-chain rigidity by stabilizing the tropomyosin coiled-coil. Using molecular 
dynamics, we now directly assess changes in coiled-coil curvature and flexibility caused by such mutants. Although the 
coiled-coil flexibility is modestly diminished near the residue 137 mutation site, as expected, a delocalized increase in 
flexibility along the overall coiled-coil is observed. even though the average shape of the D137L tropomyosin is straighter 
than that of wild-type tropomyosin, it is still capable of binding actin due to this increase in flexibility. We conclude that 
the conserved, non-canonical Asp-137 destabilizes the local structure resulting in a local flexible region in the middle of 
tropomyosin that normally is important for tropomyosin steady-state equilibrium position on actin.

Introduction

Tropomyosin, the α-helical coiled-coil actin binding protein, asso-
ciates superhelically along F-actin and polymerizes via end-to-end 
interactions to form a continuous cable-like strand. Tropomyosin 
mechanically stabilizes the thin filament and increases its flexural 
rigidity.1 In non-muscle cells, tropomyosin also regulates the inter-
action of many actin binding proteins, while in muscle, tropomy-
osin specifically controls the cooperative binding of myosin with 
actin, and hence motor activity.

The α-helical coiled-coil is a common structural motif found 
in a wide array of structural proteins such as keratin, myosin and 
tropomyosin.  Typically  the  coiled-coil  is  defined  by  the  heptad 
amino  acid  repeat  sequence  (abcdefg)n.  A  3.5  residue  periodic-
ity  along  the  supercoil  axis  aligns  a  and  d  position  hydrophobic 
residues  in  the  adjacent  α-helix,  thus  stabilizing  the  interaction 
interface,2,3  while  residues  at  the  e  and  g  positions  are  typically 
oppositely charged and flank the hydrophobic core, forming salt 
bridges between apposed helical chains. Right-handed α-helices in 
coiled-coils  wrap  around  each  other  to  form  a  quaternary  struc-
ture with function related to the specific ‘design’ of their coiled-coil 
domains.4 In tropomyosin the superhelical coiled-coil matches the 
contours of the F-actin helix.5,6

Interestingly,  the  canonical  hydrophobic  a/d  seam  along  the 
heptad repeat of tropomyosin is disrupted by a highly conserved

substitution placing an aspartic acid in the d position at residue 137 
where typically a hydrophobic residue would reside. Biochemical 
studies have shown a decrease in proteolytic susceptibility when the 
Asp at 137 was replaced with a canonical Leu (D137L). A decrease 
in proteolytic susceptibility may result from this stabilization of the 
coiled-coil interaction and potentially a reduction in the flexibility 
of the tropomyosin molecule.7

Here we used Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations to directly 
evaluate  the  structural  consequences  of  the  D137L  mutation  on 
coiled-coil structure, curvature, and flexibility. MD predicts that 
introduction of the leucine residue reduces both curvature and flex-
ibility near the site of the mutation, which results in a straighter 
molecule.  Although  the  overall  structure  of  the  molecule  is  dis-
rupted, we find that tropomyosin containing the D137L mutation 
spends a fraction of time in a structure similar to the one required 
for tropomyosin to be able to wrap natively around F-actin, thus 
explaining the ability of the mutant tropomyosin to still bind to 
actin.7

Results

Biochemical studies previously indicated that mutation of the con-
served Asp at position 137 to Leu resulted in a decrease in proteo-
lytic susceptibility, suggesting a region existed in the core of the 
tropomyosin molecule that is accessible to enzymatic cleavage.7 To

adopting  the  tropomyosin  shape  first  pro-
posed by Lorenz and Holmes5 and confirmed 
by Li et al.8 The supercoil fits to the long-pitch 
F-actin  helix,  as  it  is  presumed  to  be  when 
bound to muscle thin filaments.6 During the 
simulation,  the  coiled-coiled  structures  of 
the  wild-type,  D137L/C190A,  D137L,  and 
C190A  tropomyosins  remained  completely 
intact  during  their  respective  30  ns  runs 
(the double mutant was run twice for 30 ns 
with no apparent distinctions between runs). 
For  example,  no  unfolding  of  the  α-helices, 
lengthwise  separation  of  the  two  adjoining 
helices, or fraying at their ends was observed.
The  bending  of  tropomyosin  observed 
during the simulation always was gradual and 
continuous,  without  signs  of  localized  kink-
ing or jointed areas (Fig. 1A, Supplementary 
Movies), in agreement with rotary shadowed 
electron microscopic images of purified tropo-
myosin  molecules  lying  on  mica.9  Although 
there  are  no  distinct  kinks  or  pivot  points 
observed in the mutant molecule, the overall 
tropomyosin  shape  is  altered  by  the  muta-
tions. While the end-end bending angle, θ, of 
the wild-type and C190A tropomyosin mol-
ecules  agree  with  that  of  the  F-actin  bound 
model, the D137L mutant tropomyosin mol-
ecules were observed to be less bent (Table 1; 
Fig. 1A and B): The mean end-to-end bend-
ing angle during MD for the C190A/D137L 
double mutant and the D137L single mutant 
(24.75°  and  2.63°,  respectively),  is  consider-
ably  lower  than  that  of  C190A  control  and 
wild-type  tropomyosin  (36.1°  and  36.8°, 
respectively).  The  difference  in  end-to-end 
bending  angle  gives  the  impression  that  the 
mutant  molecules  are  much  less  flexible  than  the  wild-type  and 
C190A controls. However, the end-to-end bending angle also pro-
vides a measure of tropomyosin shape and thus the reduction likely 
reflects an overall straightening of the mutant molecule.

Flexibility δ (°)

Since tropomyosin is a curved molecule, the proper gauge of 
tropomyosin flexibility is the average deviation from the average 
structure, δ, during the simulation (Fig. 1C). As can be seen in 
Table 1, both the C190A and the D137L single mutations mod-
estly increased flexibility (δ = 28.6° and δ = 32.7° for C190A and 
D137L  respectively).  The  increased  flexibility  conferred  by  the 
two mutations appears to be more than additive with the double 
mutant yielding a much increased flexibility, δ = 44.9° (Table 1). 
Therefore the smaller θ reflects an overall straightening of the mol-
ecule since the flexibility increases.

for the wild-type tropomyosin sequence (light blue) and the control c190A mutant sequence 
(gold). Note the overall curvature of the c190A tropomyosins matches closely to wild-type 
tropomyosin, which closely matches the long-pitch helical repeat of actin.8 (B) Average struc-
tures for the D137L (red) and D137L/c190A (blue) mutant tropomyosin sequences. Overall, the 
average structure of the mutant tropomyosin deviates from wild-type and control average 
conformations resulting in a straighter molecule. (c) Tropomyosin curvature is assessed via the 
mean end-to-end bending angle, θ, which is calculated by comparing the tangent angles of 
the central coiled-coil axis of the N and c-terminal 15 residues (red arrows). Since tropomyosin 
is a curved molecule, flexibility is determined by examining δ, the angular deflection of the rod 
from its averaged curved shape.

assess the structural importance of tropomyosin residue 137, we 
studied both the single mutation, D137L, as well as the double 
mutant, D137L/C190A, using MD simulations. D137L/C190A 
and C190A tropomyosin were chosen for study to be consistent 
with  previous  in  vitro  work,7  which  utilized  the  C190A  muta-
tions  to  avoid  potential  complications  due  to  possible  disulfide 
cross-linking at residue Cys 190. The effects of the Leu substitu-
tion  were  compared  with  those  of  both  C190A  mutants  and  a 
wild-type control, which retains the native Cys at position 190. 
We find that substitution of Cys at position 190 with Ala has only 
minor delocalized effects on the overall structure of the tropo-
myosin. However, substitution of Asp 137 with Leu resulted in a 
generalized straightening of the molecule, which is stiffer in the 
region surrounding the mutation but globally more flexible.

Average Structure

Anisotropic Bending

MD simulations were begun by using mutant tropomyosin refer-
ence structures in the superhelical coiled-coil conformation, thus 

As we have previously shown,8 wild-type tropomyosin does not 
uniformly sample all bending directions. Instead, as can be seen

myosin is tracked during MD (while the N-terminus 
orientation is fixed at the origin) the wild-type tropo-
myosin molecule bends anisotropically and primarily 
samples  positions  in  quadrants  3  and  4  (in  the  left 
planar slices). Thus while the wild-type tropomyosin 
molecule  flexes  it  always  comes  back  to  the  starting 
molecule  conformation,  i.e.,  where  the  superhelical 
shape  of  isolated  tropomyosin  matches  its  superheli-
cal binding shape on F-actin. In contrast, the D137L 
and D137L/C190A mutants spend less time near the 
Lorenz-Holmes  conformation  (Square,  Fig.  2)  and 
are on average straighter (Fig. 1). However, they sam-
ple a larger amount of conformational space and are 
thus more flexible (Table 1). Importantly, the D137L 
mutants are able to occasionally visit the shape of the 
Lorenz-Holmes conformation (Fig. 2C and 2D).

Local Structure

As shown previously, the greatest degree of local cur-
vature is observed in the middle portion of wild-type 
tropomyosin  near  residue  137;  i.e.,  there  is  a  mod-
est  local  bend  in  the  surrounds  of  this  residue.8  We 
therefore assessed the effects of the D137L mutation 
on the local area proximal to the mutation (Fig. 3). 
Namely, we examined the local curvature of the aver-
aged  structures  (a  probe  of  intrinsic  bending)  and 
the  local  deviations  from  the  average  structures  (a 
probe  of  local  flexibility).  As  can  be  seen  in  Figure 
3A,  there  is  a  high  degree  of  local  curvature  in  the 
residues immediately preceding Asp 137 for the wild-
type tropomyosin. This curvature was diminished in 
the mutant tropomyosins, indicating that the effects 
of  substitution  in  the  tropomyosin  sequence  can  be 
both short- and long-ranged. Here, substitution of Asp 
with Leu at position 137 caused an overall reduction in curvature 
in  the  surrounding  region  (Fig.  3B;  Table  1).  While  the  local 
curvature decreases near the site of the mutation (Fig. 3B) other 
regions also behave differently from the wild-type sequence (Fig. 
3A). Some regions displayed an increase in curvature while others 
displayed a decrease resulting in an average structure that is less 
curved than wild-type (Fig. 1).

Figure 2. c-terminal variation plots. (A–D) x,y coordinates of the tropomyosin 
c-terminus are plotted for each frame of the simulation after superposing the first 
15 residues at the N-terminus, orienting them along the z-axis (out of page), and 
aligning them at the origin. each point represents the projection of the position of 
the c-terminal residue for each conformer observed during the MD simulation. The 
average c-terminal position of the MD structures for each tropomyosin is indicated 
in their respective panels (open diamond) for comparison with that of the Lorenz–
holmes model (open square). Wild-type (A) and c190A (B) tropomyosins display the 
characteristic anisotropic bending with the c-terminus frequently in quadrants 3 
and 4. On the other hand the straighter D137L (c) and D137L/c190A (D) spend much 
more time in quadrants 1 and 2.

substitution with the leucines (Fig. 4B). The Leu side chains at 
position 137 within the hydrophobic core result in a straighter 
molecule in the region surrounding the mutation (Fig. 4C), in 
accord with the straight shape of a canonical coiled-coil.

Discussion

Local  flexibility,  namely  the  variance  in  curvature,  is  also 
affected  by  mutation  of  residue  137  to  Leu.  Changes  were 
observed throughout the length of the molecule (Fig. 3C), sug-
gesting some long-range effects of the mutation on supercoiling. 
In  the  region  immediately  surrounding  the  137  mutation  site 
MD  predicts  that  the  coiled-coil  flexibility  would  be  modestly 
diminished (Fig. 3D; Table 1).

The  effects  of  the  Leu  substitution  on  the  packing  of  the 
coiled-coil  can  be  seen  in  Figure  4.  In  wild-type  tropomyosin 
containing Asp 137, a “cavity” is introduced between the tropo-
myosin helices as a result of the electrostatic repulsion between 
the  two  side  chains.  The  typical  “knobs-into-holes”  packing 
expected with a canonical hydrophobic side chain is noted after 

A charged aspartic acid at residue 137 is a highly conserved substi-
tution in the d position of the canonical coiled-coil hydrophobic 
core  of  tropomyosin.  The  substitution  stems  from  the  consti-
tutive  exon  4  and  is  found  in  both  low  molecular  weight  and 
high molecular weight tropomyosins.10 Here we used molecular 
dynamics simulations to characterize the structural consequences 
of this unique Asp insertion in tropomyosins. The principal find-
ing of this study is that Asp at position 137 is critically important 
for maintaining an average tropomyosin structure that matches 
the  superhelical  shape  of  its  actin  binding  site.  Substitution  of 
Asp137 with a more typical Leu hydrophobic residue causes an 
overall straightening and a local stiffening of the region surround-
ing the mutation. This could be thought to reduce the ability of

tic  cleavage,14  and  V8  protease 
cleaves at Glu-131.15 Substitution 
of Asp 137 with Leu reduces pro-
teolytic susceptibility suggesting 
that  the  D137  could  destabilize 
or  otherwise  expose  the  sur-
rounding region of tropomyosin. 
Since the proteolytic susceptibil-
ity  is  related  to  the  fraction  of 
time that the molecule is in the 
cleavable  state  and  the  suscep-
tibility  to  proteolysis  is  dimin-
ished with the Leu substitution, 
it  was  proposed  that  Asp  137  is 
responsible  for  conformational 
fluctuation  in  this  region.  This 
is  consistent  with  the  reduced 
“cavity” at position 137 observed 
when  comparing  the  wild-type 
and the mutant MD simulations 
(Fig. 4A and B).

In  the  myosin  rod  domain, 
introduction  of  an  aspartic  acid 
residue into the hydrophobic core 
at  the  a  position  of  the  coiled-
coil produced dramatic localized 
bending  points  that  correlated 
with  the  site  of  the  mutation.16 
To  a  degree  our  observation  of 
modestly 
increased  flexibility 
in  tropomyosin  with  Asp-137 
inserting  into  the  d-position  of 
the hydrophobic ridge parallels this observation; however, the 
present MD simulations indicate a gradual curvature with no 
distinct  pivot  points  or  kinks  for  both  mutant  and  wild-type 
tropomyosin  molecules  (Fig.  1;  Movies  1–3).  The  distinct 
structural geometry17 and the amino acid selection at the a and 
d positions of coiled-coils18 likely accounts for distinct effects 
of substitution with a charged side chain at the respective posi-
tions in the two proteins.

´

Several  other  non-canonical  residues  are  present  in  the 
tropomyosin heptad repeat. For example, Gly 126 in the g posi-
tion might perturb coiled-coil structure by disrupting α-helical 
structure  and  inter-chain  salt  bridges.  Recently  it  was  shown 
that,  similar  to  the  Leu  substitution  at  Asp  137,  mutation  of 
Gly  126  to  Ala  or  Arg  also  dramatically  reduced  proteolytic 
susceptibility  at  Arg-133  in  both  smooth  and  skeletal  muscle 
tropomyosin,19 suggesting that both D137 and G126 destabilize 
the middle region of the tropomyosin molecule, consistent with 
the decreased stiffness seen in the region between residues 130 
and 140 of wild-type tropomyosin (Fig. 3).

When  bound  to  actin,  the  D137L  tropomyosin  signifi-
cantly increases the ATPase activity of myosin in the presence 
of thin filaments at maximal calcium activation.7 This effect can 
be explained by considering the consequences of the three state

the D137L mutant to bind to actin. However, the overall flexibil-
ity of the D137L mutants increases significantly compared with 
the wild-type tropomyosin. The mutant molecules still can spend 
a fraction of time in a conformation near to that competent for 
actin binding, hence explaining the experimentally shown ability 
of the mutant molecules to retain binding affinity for actin.7

In close proximity to Asp137, Glu139 and Glu142 are among 
the few amino acids on tropomyosin involved in binding to basic 
amino  acids  on  F-actin.11,12  Thus  the  role  of  these  negatively 
charged residues differ: Glu 139 and Glu 142 are responsible for 
fine tuning the binding precision of tropomyosin to actin while 
the curvature conferred by Asp 137 facilitates the overall binding 
association of tropomyosin and F-actin.13 Numerous mutations 
in tropomyosin have been reported to be associated with various 
cardiomyopathies and other muscle disorders. We note that none 
of these are at residue 137, highlighting the essential nature of 
this conserved feature of the protein’s architecture; mutation at 
Asp137 presumably would be lethal. Moreover, some degree of 
conformational flexibility at this site might be needed to allow 
accurate movement of tropomyosin on actin between regulatory 
states of the thin filament.

The region surrounding Asp 137 has been shown to be par-
ticularly  susceptible  to  proteolysis.  Arg  133,  has  been  shown

known to undergo regulatory movement azimuthally over the 
surface of the actin filament. In the so-called “blocked” posi-
tion,  tropomyosin  lies  over  successive  actin  subunits  on  their 
outer domains while in the “closed” position, tropomyosin lies 
on the actin inner domain near the junction of the inner and 
outer domains.20 Myosin binding results in a further movement 
to the “open” position. Movement between these three discrete 
positions on actin affect myosin binding, actomyosin ATPase, 
and actin filament velocity. In the absence of calcium, myosin-
binding sites on actin are covered by tropomyosin constrained 
in the blocking position. The transition from the blocked state 
to  the  closed  state  is  regulated  by  Ca2+  binding  to  troponin 
while full activation requires the myosin induced movement of 
tropomyosin from the closed position to the open state of the 
thin  filament.  This  latter  component  is  cooperative  in  nature 
and  results  in  the  rapid  switching  on  of  muscle  during  acti-
vation. The lack of effect on calcium sensitivity7 suggests that 
the structural alterations caused by the mutation do not affect 
the  blocked-open  equilibrium.  Instead  the  increased  activ-
ity observed for the mutation could be explained by a shift in 
either the open-closed equilibrium or the cooperative unit size. 
It  seems  reasonable  that  the  introduction  of  a  flexible  region 
near  Asp  137  in  a  molecule  less  well  designed  to  match  the 
F-actin helical contour could affect the ability of tropomyosin 
position switching to be propagated along the thin filament and 
decrease cooperative unit size. In contrast, the D137L mutation 
may disrupt the open-closed equilibrium via an altered interac-
tion with troponin. Consistent with this notion, recent experi-
ments  that  show  cross-linking  of  tropomyosin  residue  146  to 
the C-terminus of troponin I.21 indicate that a direct interaction 
between tropomyosin and troponin I may modulate tropomyo-
sin position. Alterations in the interaction of the D137L mutant 
tropomyosin with the C-terminus of troponin I could result in 
a perturbation of the tropomyosin with an equilibration toward 
an open or near-open state as has been proposed from related 
studies on a the effect of a troponin I truncation mutant.22

Conclusions

Figure 4. comparing the local packing around position 137 (A) packing of 
Asp 137 at the d-position residue (B) packing of Leu 137 at the d-position. 
Note that the Leu side chains of the D137L mutant stably pack into the 
hydrophobic core of the α-helical coiled-coil while the Asp side chains are 
pushed outwards. The average structure of the region surrounding Asp 
137 (residues 131–142) for the wild-type and D137L mutant tropomyosin 
(c) show that the D137L substitution yields a straighter molecule.

Materials and Methods

Molecular Dynamics: Molecular Dynamics simulations were run 
on homology models of tropomyosin “single mutants” (D137L or 
C190A) and a D137L/C190A “double mutant.” The models were 
constructed to otherwise match the structure of a previously deter-
mined atomic model of αα-cardiac tropomyosin;8 in each case, the 
Asp137 and/or the Cys190 on each chain of the αα-cardiac tropo-
myosin template was replaced with a corresponding Leu for Asp or 
Ala for Cys. The starting structure was first energy optimized and 
MD run for 25 to 50 ns at 300° K with Langevin dynamics and an 
implicit solvent model using the program CHARMM c33b223,24 as 
described in reference 8. Previously developed methods8,25 to deter-
mine tropomyosin local curvature and flexibility along the length 
of tropomyosin were implemented.

Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest

No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

Tropomyosins  possess  a  conserved  Asp  at  amino  acid  posi-
tion  137.  Here  MD  simulations  indicate  that  substitution  of 
Asp  137  with  a  hydrophobic  residue  in  the  canonical  d  posi-
tion of the tropomyosin coiled-coil decreases overall curvature, 
yet increases flexibility. The strong conservation of Asp 137 in 
tropomyosin isoforms suggests that this non-canonical residue, 
is required for proper actin binding and modulation of tropo-
myosin equilibrium position, and consequently is necessary for 
fine-tuning physiological responses.
