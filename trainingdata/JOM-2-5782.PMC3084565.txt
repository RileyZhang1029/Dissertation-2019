An estimated 80 million US adults have one or more types of cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis is the
single most important contributor to cardiovascular diseases; however, only 50% of atherosclerosis patients
have currently identified risk factors. Chronic periodontitis, a common inflammatory disease, is linked to an
increased cardiovascular risk. Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen presenting cells that infiltrate arterial
walls and may destabilize atherosclerotic plaques in cardiovascular disease. While the source of these DCs in
atherosclerotic plaques is presently unclear, we propose that dermal DCs from peripheral inflamed sites such
as CP tissues are a potential source. This review will examine the role of the opportunistic oral pathogen
Porphyromonas gingivalis in invading DCs and stimulating their mobilization and misdirection through the
bloodstream. Based on our published observations, combined with some new data, as well as a focused review
of the literature we will propose a model for how P. gingivalis may exploit DCs to gain access to systemic
circulation and contribute to coronary artery disease. Our published evidence supports a significant role
for P. gingivalis in subverting normal DC function, promoting a semimature, highly migratory, and
immunosuppressive DC phenotype that contributes to the inflammatory development of atherosclerosis and,
eventually, plaque rupture.

pathological manifestations

The

chronic
periodontitis (CP), namely, destruction of
the
soft and hard tissues that support the dentition
culminating in tooth loss, have been previously described,
as has the high prevalence of the CP in the general adult
population (1, 2). Also well documented is the specific
role of the anaerobic Gram-negative species, Porphyro-
monas gingivalis, in infection of the tissues around the
dentition in CP and in initiation of CP (3). P. gingivalis,
along with two other species, Tannerella forsythia and
Treponema denticola, comprise the so-called red complex
of pathogens (4) that function cooperatively within the
subgingival plaque of CP (1, 2, 57). P. gingivalis has been
associated with several important systemic diseases such
as cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, preterm
birth weight, and diabetes mellitus (8, 9). Our group
is particularly interested in the influx and efflux of
various dendritic cells (DCs) in response to P. gingivalis

and their role in local and systemic inflammatory
processes. DCs are very active antigen-capture cells
when immature. When DCs mature,
they become
potent antigen-presenting cells and are very efficient at
stimulating T-naƒ±¬®ve cells to differentiate into T-cell
effectors [reviewed in Steinman (10), Cutler (11)]. DCs
have been implicated in a number of allergic and
inflammatory diseases in the periphery [reviewed in
Velazquez and Teran (12)] including atherosclerosis (13,
14). Being central to the development of immunologic
memory and tolerance (15), the normal
immunologic
function of DCs is to patrol the periphery, capture
infecting microbes and then migrate out to the secondary
lymphoid organs where they can initiate and regulate the
adaptive immune response. DC functions in this regard
are tightly regulated and depend on the activation signals
that DCs receive in the periphery [reviewed in Cutler
and Jotwani (16)]. These signals include inflammatory

cytokines, chemokines, as well as pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPS) of bacteria. The develop-
ment of gingivitis and periodontitis involves the influx
and efflux of different DC subsets at distinct stages
of disease (Fig. 1). Dendritic Langerhans cells (LC)
infiltrate the gingival epithelium in gingivitis and then
efflux into the lamina propria in CP, where they begin
to undergo maturation (17). Dermal dendritic cells

(DC-SIGN) increase in the lamina propria in CP and
become localized toward the lymphatics and vasculature
(1820). LCs have been implicated in both the initiation
and regulation of contact-hypersensitivity responses
in mice (21) [reviewed in Igyarto and Kaplan (22)],
while dermal DCs have been implicated in many other
inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and
inflammatory bowel disease (23). This review will focus

inÔ¨Åltrated with numerous Langerhans cells in the epithelium, with sparse dermal dendritic cells in the lamina propria. As disease
progresses, the oral bioÔ¨Ålm changes to a predominantly Gram-negative subgingival Ô¨Çora (red dots). In response, a dramatic loss
(efÔ¨Çux) of Langerhans cells occurs from the epithelium toward the lamina propria. Also observed is an inÔ¨Çux of myeloid-derived
DC-SIGN dermal dendritic cells (DCs) into the lamina propria. Present are neutrophils, macrophages (mf), B-cells, and
CD4 and CD8 T-cells. The DCs form immune conjugates with CD4 T-cells and also mobilize toward the vasculature.

the gingival lamina propria. These mDCs undergo reverse transmigration through the vascular endothelium. Once in the
circulation, mDCs carrying P. gingivalis attach to endothelial integrins via DC-SIGN and, after rolling adhesion, undergo
diapedesis between endothelial cells. As the atheroma continues to mature and DCs contribute to the foam cells and release
MMP-9, the atheroma becomes highly unstable and, eventually, thrombus formation occurs.

tions to the development (and instability) of athero-
sclerotic plaques.

Atherosclerosis and microbes
Atherosclerosis (ATH) is a progressive disease character-
ized by the accumulation of lipids, fibrous elements, and
inflammatory cells in the large arteries. ATH constitutes
the single most important contributor to the growing
worldwide burden of cardiovascular disease. Only about
50% of patients with ATH have currently identified risk
factors (24). This suggests how little we know about ATH
risk. Inflammation in the arterial vessel wall is particularly
important in the development of ATH. Four mechanisms
have been proposed for how bacterial pathogens may
induce or accelerate ATH [reviewed in Gibson et al.
(25)]. These include: (i) direct invasion of the vascular
endothelium by pathogens in the blood, (ii) immunological
sounding, (iii) molecular mimicry, and (iv) pathogen
trafficking of microbes within leukocytes in peripheral
blood.

Of particular relevance to atherogenesis are bacterial
species that infect and survive within endothelial cells and
within migrating leukocytes [reviewed in Rackley (26)].
A prevailing hypothesis is that, regardless of their viability
status, bacteria release PAMPs that serve as agonists
for TLRs, thus activating inflammatory leukocytes and
endothelial cells, and can contribute to the development
of ATH (27). Large population studies support the role of
bacterial species in ATH (28, 29). However, the results of
clinical trials using antibiotics to treat cardiovascular
disease have been disappointing (3033). Many athero-
genic bacteria, including P. gingivalis, are intracellular
pathogens (34, 35). An apparent consequence of this is
that these pathogens are less susceptible to antibiotics
when sequestered inside host cells. P. gingivalis is 100-fold
more resistant to moxofloxocin, 10-fold more resistant
to clindamycin and metronidazole when inside host
epithelial cells (36). Clindamycin- and azithromycin-
resistant P. gingivalis isolates have been identified in human
subjects with CP (37).

P. gingivalis has also been identified in human ATH
plaques (38), as have other atherogenic bacteria such
as Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori
(27, 39, 40). Experimental
infection with P. gingivalis
accelerates ATH in animal models (35, 41). The FINRISK
1992 cohort study of 6,051 individuals implicates exposure
to P. gingivalis or endotoxin in increased risk for cardio-
vascular diseases (42). A recent meta-analysis indicated
that
the level of systemic bacterial exposure in CP
mediates ATH risk (43, 44). Another meta-analysis
studied human cohort
studies,
and cross-sectional studies and concluded that CP is a
significant risk factor for developing coronary artery
disease (CAD) (44). The degree of increased risk of

CAD conferred by CP appears comparable to smoking
(45) and elevated serum triglycerides (46). Viable and
invasive P. gingivalis, though in a dormant state, have been
cultured from human ATH plaques (38). This has not
been shown with other atherogenic bacteria such as C.
pneumoniae and H. pylori, which have only been identified
by DNA-based methods (27, 39, 40). Overall, several
infectious agents have been shown to be disseminated
by pathogen trafficking leukocytes, they include Strepto-
coccus pyogenes (47), C. pneumoniae (48), and Listeria
monocytogenes (49).

P.gingivalis virulence and targeting of dendritic
cells (DCs)
P. gingivalis is a an amino acid fermentor with an absolute
requirement for hemin (2). The bacteria utilizes its many
virulence factors to fulfill its complex nutritional require-
ments, while still enabling it to evade and even modulate
the host immune system (1, 2, 5). Several virulence factors
including the polysaccharide capsule, fimbriae, proteases
for opsonins C3, proteases for IgG, gingipains, bacterial
lipopolysaccharides (LPS), toxins, and hemagglutinins
enable P. gingivalis to persist in the oral mucosa and help
facilitate some of the physiopathology of CP (19, 5056).
There are two fimbriae that are essential adhesins
for the invasion and colonization of the oral mucosa by
P. gingivalis. These adhesins, termed the major and
minor fimbriae, are distinct antigenically by amino acid
composition and by size (57, 58). The major fimbriae
form long projections from the bacteria and have been
shown in most reports to facilitate their adhesion to and
invasion of the host cells. The major fimbriae is a 41 kDa
protein, encoded by the fimA gene (59), and many of its
cellular receptors have been identified as either the b-1
integrins (CD29) (60, 61) or the b-2 integrins (CD18) (62
64). The minor fimbriae (though much shorter) are
comprised of a 67 kDa protein encoded by the mfa1
gene (57). We have recently shown that
the minor
fimbriae targets DC specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-
integrin (DC-SIGN or CD209) on monocyte-derived
DCs for entry (5). DC-SIGN is a type II membrane
protein in which the extracellular domain consists of a
stalk that promotes tetramerization (65). It contains a
C-terminal carbohydrate recognizing domain (CRD) that
belongs to the C-type lectin superfamily (65). Early
studies by Feinberg et al. showed that the DC-SIGN
CRD preferentially binds to the high-mannose N-linked
oligosaccharides GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) and
Mana1-3[Mana1-6] Man (mannose) (65). Furthermore,
Appelmelk et al. showed that DC-SIGN also binds
to fucose-containing Lewis blood antigens (66). Guo
et al. utilized an extensive glycan array and showed
that DC-SIGN will bind high mannose-containing
glycans or glycans that contain terminal fucose residues
(67). Previous studies showed that DC-SIGN is used by

microorganisms
such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae (68),
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (66, 69, 70), Mycobacterium
leprae, HIV (71), H. pylori (66), and P. gingivalis (5) to
target DCs for entry and immune suppression.

Pathological consequences of DC-SIGN
targeting
The ability of minor fimbriae to specifically target DC-
SIGN on DCs has significant pathological and immuno-
logical repercussions. Periodontitis lesions contain an
intense infiltrate of DC-SIGN DCs (17, 72). DCs in the
lesions become activated and appear to mobilize toward
the capillary-rich lamina propria (17). We propose
that infection of DCs by P. gingivalis triggers reverse
transmigration of infected gingival DCs into circulation
and these may contribute to the pathogenesis of ATH
(Fig. 1). Evidence exists for the presence of activated
DC-SIGN myeloid DCs in rupture prone unstable
plaques (13, 73). The sources of these DC-SIGN
plaque DCs are not clear, but presumably may include
DCs from inflamed peripheral tissues. Other sources of
DCs may include CD14 CD16 monocytes, CD14low
CD16 monocytes (74) that differentiate into DCs in
situ (5). DCs that infiltrate rupture-prone atherosclerotic
plaques express atherogenic markers including C1q (a
classical complement pathway component involved in
apoptotic cell clearance); HSP60 and HSP70 (chaperone
proteins involved in autoimmune responses); chemokine
receptors CCR2, CCR5, CX3CR1; and chemokines
CXCL16, CCL19, and CCL21 (involved in DC transmi-
gration and leukocyte homing) (7476). Also expressed
are DC maturation markers CD40, CD80, and CD86
(73, 77). Matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which
are highly expressed in vulnerable regions of the athero-
sclerotic plaques and suggested to be causally involved in
plaque rupture (78), is produced by leukocytes including
DCs. The P. gingivalis LPS is a particularly potent
inducer of MMP-9 but not TIMP-1 by DCs, suggesting
that P. gingivalis induces an MMP-9/TIMP-1 imbalance
in DCs (79). Our published data indicated that fimbriated
strains of P. gingivalis infect DCs and induce atherogenic
biomarkers in vitro, but the mechanisms are not presently
clear (5).

Immunological consequence of targeting
DC-SIGN on dendritic cells (DCs)
DC-SIGN targeting by minor fimbriae results in a
dampening of the maturation status and the inflammatory
cytokine profile of DCs. Conversely, removal of the minor
fimbriae results in robust DC maturation coupled with
a strong proinflammatory cytokine response (5). This
regulation of DC immunogenic functions based on minor
fimbriae expression extends to the T-cell effector response
elicited by DCs. In DC-CD4 T-cell coculture experi-
ments, P. gingivalis strains expressing solely the minor

expressing

fimbriae induced DCs to prime T-cells into a Th2 effector
phenotype, whereas,
the
major fimbriae induced DCs to prime T-cells into a Th1
effector phenotype (5). Intriguingly, the wild-type strain
was able to stimulate a mixed or anergic T-cell effector
phenotype (5). Furthermore, in vitro studies in the presence
of DC-SIGN targeting agonists (e.g. mannan from
S. cerevisiae or glycosylated HIV gp120) resulted in a
diminished association of minor fimbriated strains with
cells (5). When the wild-type strain of P. gingivalis
was cocultured with glycosylated HIV gp120, we observed
a dramatic uncoupling of DC maturation from DC
inflammatory cytokine secretion (5). The presence of
HIV or even Candida albicans (etiological agent of oral
thrush) might act synergistically with P. gingivalis to
further exasperate this uncoupling and act to greatly
diminish DC maturation.

that direct

Mechanisms of DC mobilization, access to
peripheral blood
Experimental studies demonstrate the important role that
chemokines and chemokine receptors play in trafficking
of leukocytes to and invasion of the arterial wall in ATH
(8084). Immature DCs express inflammatory chemokine
receptors (Table 1)
their migration into
infected tissues. In response to capture of antigens or to
TLR-mediated recognition of microbes, DCs undergo
a process called functional maturation in which they
downregulate inflammatory chemokine receptors and
upregulate homeostatic chemokine receptors (Table 1).
This directs DC migration out of the tissues toward
lymph nodes. When the DC maturation process is
disrupted, as occurs in DC-SIGN ligation (5), activated
DCs ostensibly undergo reverse transmigration into the
blood (Fig. 1), which can lead to systemic inflammation.
This process contributes to the initiation, progression,
and instability of arterial plaque in patients with CAD.
Recent studies have investigated the presence of blood
DCs in patients with CAD, but the results are contro-
versial (85, 86). Shi et al. found that the total peripheral
blood CD11cDCs were significantly higher in patients
with CAD compared to healthy controls (85). Conversely,
Yilmaz et al. found a decrease in circulating DCs in
patients with CAD (86). However, the patient population
and markers used for DC isolation were different.
None of the studies reported the presence of CP on these
patients, which might have affected these conflicting
findings. An attempt has been made to correlate the
presence of blood DCs as a risk factor for CAD (87).
Further, much speculation has been made about the
source of these DCs that infiltrate the atheromas.

Fully matured DCs lose their ability to uptake and
process antigens, stop migrating, and express CD83 and
other molecules involved in antigen presentation to
T-cells (88). Full maturation of DCs also results in loss

of expression of many endocytic receptors, including DC-
SIGN; thus, expression of DC-SIGN is one indicator that
DC are not fully mature (89). There is evidence that a
particular subset of blood DCs expressed DC-SIGN and
that this receptor may be involved in the uptake and
dissemination of HIV (90). Engering et al. showed that
DC-SIGN blood DCs are able to stimulate prolifera-
tion of allogeneic T-cells, as well as infect these T-cells in
trans (90). Potentially, DC-SIGN blood DCs can
disseminate pathogens, increase systemic inflammation,
and contribute to plaque instability.

Environmental regulation of fimbriae: possible
role in systemic immunosuppression,
dissemination of P. gingivalis
Wu et al. discovered that the major and minor fimbriae are
regulated by a two component regulatory system termed
FimS/FimR (91). It was also determined that while FimR
binds directly to mfa1, it will only bind to the first gene of
the fimA gene cluster, pg2130 (91, 92). Moreover, this two
component regulatory system responds to environmental
cues like heme and temperature (91). However, it is still
not clear how these adhesive fimbriae are regulated
in vivo. The possibility of major and minor fimbriae
being differentially regulated in response to different
environmental cues or stimuli may allow this organism
to modulate the immune system to expand its ecological
niche. Moreover, our observations of intact bacteria inside
DC-SIGN rich vesicles might explain the dissemination of
this organism to atherosclerotic plaques (5). We propose

here that P. gingivalis interacts with DC-SIGN on dermal
DCs from the gingiva mucosa (unpublished observation).
This interaction facilitates uptake of P. gingivalis and
immunomodulation of normal DC functions. Directed
migration is disrupted and DCs then migrate through the
endothelium instead of the lymphatic system (Fig. 1).
Once in the endothelium, the DC undergoes partial
maturation resulting in adherence to the endothelium
and recruitment of other leukocytes. Soilleux et al.
previously described the presence of immature (lacking
CD83 but expressing HLA-DR and LAMP) DC-SIGN
DCs on atherosclerotic plaques (73). Strikingly,
this
maturation profile is very similar to our results with minor
fimbriated strains (Pg381 and DPG-3) and DCs (5). Thus,
P. gingivalis infected DCs may exit into the bloodstream
and migrate to the site of developing atheroma, where they
adhere to and invade the arterial endothelium. Recent
reports suggest that P. gingivalis is able to spread from
infected epithelial, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells to
new host cells where it multiplies (93). These mechanisms
might explain how an oral opportunistic pathogen is
able to disseminate throughout its host and potentially
facilitate the formation of atherosclerotic plaques.
