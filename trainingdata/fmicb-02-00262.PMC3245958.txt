Campylobacter coli is the most common Campylobacter species found in pig (95%), but
the ability of this bacterium to survive in swine manure as well as the potential for caus-
ing human illness are poorly understood. We present here laboratory-scale experiments
to investigate the effect of temperature on the survival of C. coli in spiked swine manure
samples at temperatures from 4 to 52˚C. The survival of C. coli during storage for 30 days
was studied by three different methods: bacterial culture (plate counting), DNA qPCR, and
mRNA RT-qPCR. The results indicate that C. coli could survive in swine manure up to
24 days at 4˚C. At higher temperatures, this bacterium survived only 7 days (15˚C) or 6 days
(22˚C) of storage. The survival of C. coli was extremely short (few hours) in samples incu-
bated at 42 and 52˚C.The results from the RT-qPCR method were consistent with the data
from the bacterial culture method, indicating that it detected only viable C. coli cells, thus
eliminating false-positive resulting from DNA from dead C. coli cells.

INTRODUCTION
Livestock wastes such as manure or slurry from intensive animal
production may contain pathogenic microorganisms including
viruses, bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., and Sal-
monella), and protozoa (Mawdsley et al., 1995; Semenov et al.,
2009; Klein et al., 2011). There has been an increasing concern
about which effect of pathogens in animal manure may have on
human and animal health (Bicudo and Goyal, 2003). The manure
is a potential source of contamination to the aquatic environment
particularly where the slurry is used for fertilizing soil (Mawdsley
et al., 1995; Marti et al., 2009; Klein et al., 2011). In addition, it
has been reported that many farmers spread manure on the land
straight after removal from the tanks, either because of inade-
quate storage capacity or greater convenience (Nicholson et al.,
2005) which may release Campylobacters as well as other intesti-
nal pathogens into the environment via the feces from infected
animals.

Campylobacter spp. is currently the most common cause of
human gastrointestinal disease worldwide. It is estimated approx-
imately nine million human campylobacteriosis cases are reported
annually in 27 countries in the EU (EU27; Andreoletti et al., 2011).
The major sources of Campylobacter spp. are in animal intesti-
nal tracts including chickens, cattle, pigs, wild-living mammals,
and birds (Nielsen et al., 1997; Inglis et al., 2010; Oporto and
Hurtado, 2011). Although 95% of the human campylobacteriosis
cases attributed to Campylobacter jejuni, the importance of human
campylobacteriosis caused by Campylobacter coli is being recog-
nized due to an increased resistance of this pathogen to a greater
number of antimicrobials (Gebreyes et al., 2005). Pigs are known
to be frequently infected with Campylobacter (prevalence between

50 and 100%), to exhibit high counts of this pathogen in their
feces, and to show a dominance of C. coli species (Boes et al., 2005;
Jensen et al., 2006; Oporto et al., 2007).

It has been reported that soil is a source of microbial contam-
ination for fruits and vegetables, as evidenced by the isolation of
soil-residing pathogenic bacteria including Campylobacters from
fresh produce. Pathogens may be transferred to the environment
by application of inadequately composted or raw animal manures
or sewage (Berger et al., 2010; Gardner et al., 2011; Verhoeff-
Bakkenes et al., 2011). When pig feces or manures are applied
to the agricultural ﬁeld, the presence of C. coli could contaminate
groundwater and soil either directly or indirectly after rainfalls.
Although C. coli is responsible for less than 5–7% of human
campylobacteriosis reported cases, the impact of this bacterium
is still substantial. It is estimated that human campylobacteriosis
caused by C. coli infection has an annual cost of millions of dol-
lars but despite the economic importance of this pathogen, most
Campylobacter research focuses upon C. jejuni (Humphrey et al.,
2007; Sheppard et al., 2010). Furthermore, it has been reported
recently that drinking water is the source of C. coli infection in
grandparent breeder farms (Pérez-Boto et al., 2010). Therefore,
control of the survival of this pathogen in the slurry during storage
(prior to ﬁeld application) is important to prevent infection in man
and in animal as well as to prevent environmental contamination.
This study aimed to investigate the effect of various tem-
peratures on the survival of C. coli in swine slurry using three
different techniques: bacterial culture, DNA-based quantitative
PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR
(RT-qPCR). Conventional bacterial culture methods for detec-
tion of Campylobacter spp. involving enrichment, isolation, and

identiﬁcation at the species level are labor-intensive and time-
consuming, requiring 5–6 days to complete (Collette et al., 2008).
While the major limitation of the DNA-based qPCR method is
the potential detection of both live and dead, or non-culturable
cells (Wolffs et al., 2005), RT-qPCR method in which mRNA is
targeted instead of DNA has greater potential for detecting viable
cells (Maurer, 2006). Five different temperatures were selected:
4˚C – a temperature used to mimic the average temperature in the
slurry tank during the winter time in Denmark; 15 and 22˚C, rep-
resenting the average temperatures in spring and summer times,
respectively; 42˚C is optimal growth temperature for thermophilic
Campylobacters; 52˚C – the temperature was chosen because it has
been reported that most anaerobic digestion processes of bio-waste
are operated at temperatures more than 50˚C (Chen, 1983; Han
and Dague, 1997; Wagner et al., 2008). A putative virulence gene,
the ceuE gene of C. coli was chosen as a biomarker for C. coli detec-
tion for both qPCR and RT-qPCR assays. This gene was selected
because it represents a good candidate for C. coli detection as it
is present in all isolated strains described to date (Gonzalez et al.,
1997; Gebreyes et al., 2005; Nayak et al., 2005). Furthermore, sev-
eral ceuE DNA-based methods have been developed for detection
of C. coli directly from complex biological samples such as feces
with a high sensitivity and speciﬁcity (Bang et al., 2003; Hong et al.,
2003).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
BACTERIAL STRAINS AND CULTURE CONDITIONS
Campylobacter coli reference strain CCUG-10955 isolated from
swine manure (Culture Collection of University of Gothenburg)
was used in this study for spiking of swine manure samples. The
strain was recovered on blood agar base No. 2 (CM271; Oxoid,
Greve, Denmark) supplemented with 5% (v/v) sterile deﬁbri-
nated calf blood and isolated on modiﬁed charcoal cefoperazone
deoxycholate agar (mCCDA CM0739; Oxoid, Greve, Denmark)
with selective supplement SR0155 (Oxoid, Greve, Denmark). The
medium was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tion. A solid selective medium, Abeyta–Hunt–Bark (AHB) agar
[National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark
(DTU-Vet), Aarhus, Denmark] with 1% triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (+TCC), was used for direct determination of colony-
forming unit (CFU). All Campylobacter spp. used in this study
were grown on blood agar plates at 42˚C in microaerophilic condi-
tions, whereas Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Listeria strains were
grown on blood agar plates at 37˚C in aerobic conditions. Clostrid-
ium strain was grown on blood agar plates at 37˚C in anaerobic
conditions.
Bacterial DNA of Campylobacters (n = 9), Salmonella (n = 5),
E. coli (n = 2), Listeria (n = 1), and Clostridium (n = 1; Table 1)
was extracted using QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Copen-
hagen, Denmark). The DNA concentration was determined using
a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer Thermo Scientiﬁc (Saveen
Werner ApS, Denmark). The bacterial DNA samples (2 ng/μl)
were used to evaluate the speciﬁcity of the qPCR assays.

MANURE SAMPLES
Liquid manure slurries used in this study were collected from
seven different pig farms for three times in 2 weeks in January,

2010 in Jutland (Denmark). A total of 5 l of manure slurry were
collected from two slurry tanks at each farm using a bucket after
10 min of mechanical mixing of the tank content. Subsequently,
the contents of the bucket were stirred and a 200-ml sample was
collected into a plastic bag. A total of 50 samples were stored in ice-
boxes and immediately transported to the laboratory. On arrival,
all samples were tested for the presence of Campylobacter spp.
by both bacterial culture and qPCR methods as described below
(see Detection of C. coli by Bacterial Culture Method and Detec-
tion and Quantiﬁcation of C. coli by qPCR and RT-qPCR). Of 50
samples tested, 25 were Campylobacter-negative. All Campylobac-
ter-negative liquid manure samples were pooled and aliquoted
into 90 ml volumes and spiked with C. coli as follows. At an onset
of the experiment, each manure sample (90 ml) was spiked with
10 ml of C. coli in physiological saline (0.09% NaCl) to reach a
ﬁnal concentration of 1× 109 CFU/ml. The spiked samples (in
triplicate) were stored in Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (Carolina, USA) and
incubated at various temperatures (4, 15, 22, 42, and 52˚C) under
aerobic conditions for up to 30 days. The samples incubated at
high temperatures (42 and 52˚C) were tested at 5 and 3 h, respec-
tively after spiking and were not processed after day 1 until day
30. The samples incubated at 15 and 22˚C were not processed
after day 7. However, all samples incubated at all selected tem-
peratures were tested by culture, qPCR, and RT-qPCR assays at
day 30.

TOTAL BACTERIAL RNA AND DNA EXTRACTION
The total bacterial nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) were extracted
from manure samples using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB) buffer and a part of the RNeasy Mini RNA isolation kit
(Qiagen, Copenhagen, Denmark) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Brieﬂy, 1 ml of each bacterial manure suspension was
transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 8,000 g

for 7 min. The pellets were mixed with 0.5 ml of CTAB extraction
buffer, 0.5 ml of phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH
8.0) and 250 mg of zirconia/silica beads. The sample and beads was
mixed by vortex for 30 s. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 g for
5 min. The aqueous phase was puriﬁed by chloroform–isoamyl
alcohol (24:1) extraction. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 g
for 5 min. The volume of the aqueous phase was estimated and
the nucleic acids were precipitated by adding a 0.08 volume of
chilled 7.5 M ammonium acetate and a 0.54 volume of chilled iso-
propanol. For the DNA extraction, instructions for step (a) were
followed, and for the RNA extraction, instructions for step (b)
were followed.

a) The tube was inverted 20–30 times to mix the components and
incubated on ice for 30–40 min. The precipitated DNA was col-
lected by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 10 min at 4˚C. The DNA
pellet was washed once using ice-cold 70% ethanol and dried
by air. The DNA pellet was suspended in 50 μl of DNase-free
water. The DNA preparation was used immediately or stored
at −20˚C until needed.

b) The mixture, including any precipitate that may have formed,
was transferred to an RNeasy spin column placed in a 2-
ml collection tube from the RNeasy Mini RNA isolation kit
(Qiagen, Copenhagen, Denmark) and centrifuged for 15 s at
8,000 g. Washing steps were followed according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. The RNA was eluted in 50 μl of RNase-free
−1 of DNase I Ampliﬁcation
water and treated with 0.3 U ml
Grade (Invitrogen, Denmark) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. The DNA-free RNA products were transcribed to
complementary DNA (cDNA) using the iScript™ cDNA Syn-
thesis Kit (Bio-Rad, USA) with pre-mixed RNase inhibitor
and random hexamer primers, according to the manufacturer’s
instruction.

DESIGN OF PRIMERS AND STANDARD CURVE FOR qPCR
The sequences from ceuE gene of C. coli (accession number:
X88849.1) were obtained from NCBI GenBank and used for
primer design. After multiple sequence alignment by using the
ClustalW program (Chenna et al., 2003), a primer pair namely
ceuE-F/ceuE-R with sequences ﬂanking to the conserved regions
in C. coli ceuE gene was designed using the Primer 3 pro-
gram (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). The forward primer
(cid:2)
(ceuE-F), 5
(corresponding to
nucleotide position 3328–3348 in ceuE gene) and the reverse
(cid:2)
primer (ceuE-R), 5
(corre-
sponding to nucleotide position 3504–3524 in ceuE gene) were
used to amplify a 196-bp fragment.

To enable accurate quantiﬁcation of C. coli, a standard curve for
the qPCR assays was generated. A 24-h growth of C. coli at 42˚C
in microaerophilic conditions on blood agar plates was harvested
in physiological saline (0.09% NaCl). Serial 10-fold dilutions of C.
coli were added to each Campylobacter-negative manure sample,
and the spiked materials were immediately used for DNA isolation.
This experiment was carried in duplicate. The DNA extracts of 10-
fold dilutions from 1× 108 to 1× 102 CFU/ml were used for qPCR
assays to establish the standard curve and used for quantifying C.
coli in swine manure.

DETECTION OF C. COLI BY BACTERIAL CULTURE METHOD
−9 of
Duplicate 10-fold serial dilutions ranging from 100 to 10
each sample were prepared and 100 μl of each dilution was spread
in duplicate onto pre-dried (at 22˚C for 45 min) AHB plates
and incubated for 48 h at 42˚C in microaerophilic conditions.
The selective AHB agar plates were applied according to the rec-
ommendations of ISO 10272-1:2006 (Anonymous, 2006). Plates
were inspected to detect the presence of colonies presumed to be
Campylobacter because of their characteristics. The detection limit
of culture method was 500 CFU/ml. Five presumptive Campy-
lobacter colonies from each manure sample were picked and used
directly for veriﬁcation by a conventional PCR method described
previously (Lund et al., 2003).

DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION OF C. COLI BY qPCR AND RT-qPCR
Quantitative real-time PCR and RT-qPCR were carried out in
an Mx3005P thermocycler (Stratagene, Denmark) using ceuE
primers. The PCR mixtures (25 μl) contained 5 μl DNA or 5 μl
cDNA, 12.5 μl of 2× PCR master mix (Promega, Denmark),
400 nM of each primer and 50000× diluted SYBR green (Invit-
rogen, Denmark). The qPCR conditions consist of an initial heat–
denaturing step at 94˚C for 5 min; followed by 45 cycles of 94˚C
for 15 s, annealing at 56˚C for 20 s, and extended at 72˚C for
15 s; followed by an elongation step at 72˚C for 3 min. In every
qPCR analysis, the C. coli standard for absolute quantiﬁcation was
included. A negative control (5 μl of water) and a positive DNA
control (5 μl) of C. coli DNA (2 ng/μl) were included.

Post ampliﬁcation melting temperature (T m) analysis from 60
to 95˚C at 0.5˚C increments was conducted to conﬁrm speciﬁc
ceuE product (T m = 80˚C). The Mx3005P detection software was
used to determine threshold cycle (C t) values, T m, and the stan-
dard curve. Negative controls included RNase- and DNase-free
water and nucleic acid extracts from un-spiked manure samples
to determine any possible cross-reactivity or contamination (false-
positive results). The product of ended point qPCR assays was
also analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Five microliters
of PCR products were loaded on 2% of agarose gel (BioWhit-
taker, Inc., USA) containing 0.1 μg of ethidium bromide/ml and
the electrophoresis was performed at 400 V for 45 min. The gel
was visualized on an UV transillumination (Ultra-Violet Products,
Ltd., Cambridge, UK).

STATISTICAL ANALYSES
The values were expressed as the average± SD. The data were ana-
lyzed for statistical signiﬁcance using one-way ANOVA (ANalysis
Of VAriance, Microsoft Excel). A p-value ≤0.05 was considered to
be statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
SPECIFICITY AND SENSITIVITY OF qPCR AND RT-qPCR ASSAYS
The speciﬁcity of assays was determined by qPCR assays with the
DNA targets isolated from pure cultures of 18 Campylobacter and
non-Campylobacter strains (Table 1). All C. coli strains (n = 4)
were identiﬁed correctly. None of the ﬁve different Campylobac-
ter species and none of the non-Campylobacter strains employed
in the tests gave any positive signal (Table 1). The speciﬁcity of
the PCR ampliﬁed products was determined by both melting

curves (T m) and agarose gel electrophoresis analysis. As expected,
a T m single peak at 80˚C for C. coli ceuE gene ampliﬁed products
(Figure 1A) and a single band of 196-bp ceuE ampliﬁed prod-
uct was obtained with agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1B).
Un-spiked manure samples and water gave the expected negative
results both in the qPCR assays and in the melting curve analysis
(Figure 1). In all RT-qPCR assays, the RNA samples were ampliﬁed
by qPCR to test for DNA contamination. We did not obtain any
peaks at 80˚C or any 196-bp ampliﬁed product by gel electrophore-
sis (data not shown) on DNaseI-treated nucleic acid extracts,
verifying that DNA was totally removed. By using serial dilutions of
Campylobacter DNA and mRNA extracted as described in Section
“Materials and Methods” from a known number of C. coli, the sen-
sitivity of qPCR and RT-qPCR were tested. The sensitivity of the
DNA-based qPCR assay was as low as 100 CFU/ml, whereas the
sensitivity of the RT-qPCR assay was 1000 CFU/ml, respectively.

STANDARD CURVE FOR ABSOLUTE QUANTIFICATION OF qPCR ASSAYS
To determine absolute quantiﬁcation of qPCR, nucleic acid stan-
dard was generated from genomic DNA of C. coli. The C t-values
were plotted as a function of the cell concentration and the
plot showed the expected linear relationship between the log10
of Campylobacter CFU per milliliter (CFU/ml) and C t-values

(Figure 2). The standard curve slope was −3.218, which corre-
sponded to ∼100% efﬁciency for the PCR assay, using the formula
E (efﬁciency)= (10
−1/slope)− 1 and the calibration curve is linear
with a correlation coefﬁcient (R2)= 0.996.

DETERMINATION OF SURVIVAL OF C. COLI IN SWINE MANURE BY
BACTERIAL CULTURE AND RT-qPCR METHODS
Figure 3 shows the levels of C. coli in manure samples incu-
bated at ﬁve different temperatures: 4, 15, 22, 42, and 52˚C. A
decrease level of C. coli in all swine manure samples was observed
throughout the experiment at all incubation temperatures by both
bacterial culture and RT-qPCR methods. At 4˚C, the viable C.
coli cells were detected up to day 24 of storage by both meth-
ods (Figure 3A). Using bacterial culture and RT-qPCR methods,
approximately 5× 107 and 6.0× 103 CFU/ml were obtained at day
1 and day 24, respectively (Figure 3A). At 15˚C, the viable C. coli
cells in manure samples were still detectable up to day 7 (approx-
imately 1.2× 103 CFU/ml) by bacterial culture method but could
only be detected by RT-qPCR until day 6 (∼1× 103 CFU/ml;
Figure 3B). At 22˚C, the viable C. coli cells were detected up to
day 6 with approximately 6.2× 103 and 2× 103 CFU/ml obtained
by bacterial culture method and RT-qPCR method, respectively
(Figure 3C). As shown in Figures 3D,E), a rapid decrease of the
counts of viable C. coli cells was observed at 42˚C (approximately
1.5× 104 CFU/ml) and 52˚C (approximately 1× 104 CFU/ml)
using the bacterial culture method after 5 and 3 h of incubation,
respectively. At these high temperatures, viable C. coli cells were
not detected by both methods after 24 h. It should note that all
samples were incubated until day 30.

PERSISTENCE OF C. COLI DNA IN SWINE MANURE
As shown in Figures 3A–C, a slight decrease level of C. coli
DNA was obtained using DNA-based qPCR method at 4, 15,
and 22˚C. At 4˚C, approximately 1.2× 108 and 2.8× 107 CFU/ml
were obtained at day 1 and day 24, respectively. At 15 and 22˚C,
we observed the similar amounts of C. coli DNA ranging from
∼1× 108 to 2.7× 107 CFU/ml at day 1 and day 7, respectively
(Figures 3B,C). Although none of viable C. coli cells was observed
by either bacterial culture or RT-qPCR method at day 30 of storage,
high levels (∼2× 107 CFU/ml) of C. coli DNA were still observed
by DNA-based qPCR method in all samples at these incubation
temperatures (4, 15, and 22˚C; data not shown). At higher tem-
peratures (42 and 52˚C), although a slight decrease level of C. coli
DNA was obtained after 24 h, it was still persistent until day 30
with approximately 1.5× 103 CFU/ml (Figures 3D,E).

DISCUSSION
The introduction of new molecular methods has become an espe-
cially important advance in reducing the time required for the
detection of Campylobacter spp. and detecting viable bacteria in
environmental samples through their DNA (Rudi et al., 2004; Rid-
ley et al., 2008). The precise correlation of cell viability and the
detected level of DNA have been shown to be poor, since bacterial
DNA persists in dead cells for signiﬁcant periods of time (Masters
et al., 1994; Young et al., 2007). It has been demonstrated that bac-
terial DNA persisted in a PCR-detectable form in culture–negative
environmental (Deere et al., 1996), and clinical samples (Hellyer

et al., 1999). In contrast, the half-life of most bacterial mRNA has
been reported to range from 0.5 to 50 min (Takayama and Kjelle-
berg, 2000). In addition, it has been shown that the use of bacterial
mRNA for RT-qPCR could provide a more closely correlated indi-
cation of the cell viability status than DNA-based methods (Keer
and Birch, 2003).

In the present study, we use mRNA as a maker for cell viability,
and ceuE gene, a putative virulence gene of C. coli was selected as a
biomarker for viable cells using RT-qPCR method. The ceuE gene
product – a lipoprotein, plays an important role as a component of
a protein-binding-dependent transport system for the siderophore
enterochelin of C. coli (Richardson and Park, 1995). Our data indi-
cated that the viable cells counts of C. coli in swine manure at all
incubation temperatures determined by RT-qPCR and by culture
method were almost equivalent (Figure 3). The results are in a
good agreement with a previous study reported by Matsuda et al.
(2006) who used RT-qPCR to enumerate bacteria in human feces
and peripheral blood. Moreover, the positive signals were observed
by RT-qPCR as long as viable C. coli cells were counted by bac-
terial culture method. In contrast, our results showed that the
levels of C. coli DNA in manure obtained by DNA-based qPCR
method were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001) higher than those obtained
by either bacterial culture or RT-qPCR method in all manure
samples at all incubation temperatures tested. Although no viable
C. coli cells were detected by either bacterial culture or RT-qPCR
in any manure samples stored at day 30, the signiﬁcant levels of
C. coli DNA were still detected by DNA-based qPCR showing that

this method gave false-positive resulting from DNA from dead C.
coli cells. Similar results have been found in several previous stud-
ies and the explanation for this phenomenon is the use of qPCR to
detect the DNA as target could also detect the DNA from dead or
non-viable cells (Lund et al., 2004; Rudi et al., 2004; Wolffs et al.,
2005). It was reported that DNA from dead bacterial cells could
persist for up to 3 weeks after the cell death (Josephson et al., 1993)
and that persistence could lead to an overestimation of the number
of viable cells and false-positive results (Wolffs et al., 2005). RT-
qPCR is therefore superior to DNA-based qPCR for determining
the concentration of viable bacteria.

Recently, it has been reported that propidium monoazide PCR
(PMA-PCR) and ethidium monoazide PCR (EMA-PCR) could be
used to detect and to quantify viable Campylobacter in complex
samples (Rudi et al., 2005; Inglis et al., 2010; Josefsen et al., 2010).
However, the advantage of our method presented here is that by
detecting the mRNA level of a putative virulence gene, it is not
only possible to detect and quantify viable C. coli but also to study
the potential pathogenicity of this bacterium during the storage
of manure.

Temperature has been shown to be a major factor determin-
ing pathogen inactivation during the storing and composting of
animal manures (Hutchison et al., 2005; Nicholson et al., 2005;
Larney and Hao, 2007). However, little is known about quanti-
tative data on microbial inactivation rates and the inﬂuence of
temperature in these materials, if not controversial (Inglis et al.,
2010). In this study, the inﬂuence of temperature on the survival

Campylobacter coli in swine manure

FIGURE 3 | The detection and quantiﬁcation of C. coli in swine manure

and fate of C. coli in swine manure stored at various temperatures
was investigated. Using bacterial culture and RT-qPCR methods,
a great decline of viable C. coli cells was observed at high tem-
peratures (15, 22, 42, and 52˚C). Our ﬁndings are in very good
agreement with data from (Hänel and Atanassova, 2007) who
showed that the number of Campylobacter on turkey meat sam-
ples incubated at 25˚C was severely decreased in comparison to
the same samples incubated at 4˚C. Our data also showed that
C. coli could survive up to 24 days in the samples incubated at
4˚C in aerobic conditions. In contrast, at higher temperatures (at

42 or 52˚C), no viable C. coli cells were detected after 24 h using
either bacterial culture or RT-qPCR method. These ﬁndings are in
agreement with data from previous study reported by Garénaux
et al. (2009) who revealed that a cross protection between the cold
shock response and oxidative stress response might explain the
increased resistance of bacteria at low temperature. In addition, it
has been shown that superoxide dismutase, as well as other oxi-
dized stress related proteins were over-expressed at 4˚C (Stintzi,
2003). Several studies have suggested that the enhanced survival
of Campylobacter in various biological milieus is due to cold stress

Campylobacter coli in swine manure

(Buswell et al., 1998; Chan et al., 2001; Moen et al., 2005). Fur-
thermore, a number of genes involved in energy metabolism have
been reported to be up-regulated at 5˚C in comparison to at 25˚C
(Moen et al., 2005). Few data are available on survival of Campy-
lobacter spp. under oxidative stress conditions in animal manures,
especially swine manure. In this study, the swine manure samples
were collected from open slurry tanks at the pig farm and the con-
ditions for testing resembled aerobic conditions at the farm. From
the data of our study, it seems that the survival of C. coli in swine
manure under aerobic conditions depends on temperature. This
is of particular importance because at low temperature (4˚C) used
allows bacterial survival longer and at higher rates (24 days), while
at higher temperatures (42 and 52˚C), survival of C. coli is severely
affected (few hours).

Outbreaks of

food-borne illness caused by food-borne
pathogens associated with contaminated fruit and vegetables have
recently reported and received worldwide attention (Pakalniskiene
et al., 2009; Gajraj et al., 2011; Gardner et al., 2011). Veg-
etables can become contaminated with pathogenic organisms
while growing or during harvesting and the most likely source
is the application of manure or compost as fertilizer to ﬁelds
where crops are grown and the fecal contamination of irriga-
tion water (Berger et al., 2010; Oliveira et al., 2010). In addi-
tion, the storage of manure plays an important role in sur-
vival of pathogens during transmission (Kearney et al., 1993).
The results of our study suggest that swine manure before

application on the agricultural soil should be treated prop-
erly such as increasing the temperature up to 42˚C or even
more than 52˚C for few hours since low temperatures allow
Campylobacters survive a longer time (at
least 24 days at
4˚C).

In summary, this study compared, for the ﬁrst time, the survival
of C. coli in swine manure at various temperatures is investigated
using bacterial culture method and molecular methods. The data
suggest that C. coli in swine manure might be sensitive to aerobic
conditions at high temperatures (15 and 22˚C), especially at 42
and 52˚C. Exposure to high temperatures has a stronger effect on
survival of C. coli in swine manure than at low temperature (4˚C).
Furthermore, a good correlation was observed throughout the
experiments between the number of viable C. coli cells obtained
by RT-qPCR and those obtained by bacterial culture method. In
contrast, greater differences between DNA C. coli levels obtained
by DNA-based qPCR and CFU levels obtained by either bacterial
culture or RT-qPCR method. Our ﬁndings draw an attention for
the need of determining the level of contaminated pathogens at
various temperatures in whole-slurry or manure before applying
to the agricultural soil.
