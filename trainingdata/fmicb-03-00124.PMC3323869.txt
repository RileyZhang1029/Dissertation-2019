Superoxide, the one-electron reduced form of dioxygen, is produced in the extracellular
milieu of aquatic microbes through a range of abiotic chemical processes and also by
microbes themselves. Due to its ability to promote both oxidative and reductive reac-
tions, superoxide may have a profound impact on the redox state of iron, potentially
inﬂuencing iron solubility, complex speciation, and bioavailability. The interplay between
iron, superoxide, and oxygen may also produce a cascade of other highly reactive tran-
sients in oxygenated natural waters. For microbes, the overall effect of reactions between
superoxide and iron may be deleterious or beneﬁcial, depending on the organism and
its chemical environment. Here I critically discuss recent advances in understanding: (i)
sources of extracellular superoxide in natural waters, with a particular emphasis on micro-
bial generation; (ii) the chemistry of reactions between superoxide and iron; and (iii) the
inﬂuence of these processes on iron bioavailability and microbial iron nutrition.

Keywords: iron, superoxide, bioavailability

INTRODUCTION
−
Superoxide (O
), an anion resulting from the transfer of one-
2
electron to a molecule of oxygen, was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Edward
Neuman, a postdoctoral researcher working with Linus Pauling,
in 1934 (Neuman, 1934) as part of Pauling’s ongoing interest in
the nature of the chemical bond (Pauling, 1979). In aqueous solu-
tions, superoxide exists in equilibrium with its conjugate acid,
•
the hydroperoxyl (or perhydroxyl) radical (HOO
) (Bielski et al.,
1985). The anion dominates the equilibrium in solutions whose

pH is above the pK a = 4.8 (Bielski et al., 1985). This is the case

−
2 and HOO

in the majority of natural surface waters, and at pH ∼8.1, which
is typical of marine waters and many carbonate-buffered freshwa-
ters, superoxide is ∼2000-fold more abundant than hydroperoxyl.
To distinguish between the superoxide anion and “total” superox-
ide (i.e., both O
), I will represent “total” superoxide
−∗
as O
2 .
−∗
O
2 has two chemical properties that produce a special rela-
tionship with Fe in natural aquatic environments. First, it may act
as both a reductant (via its oxidation to O2) and oxidant (via its
reduction to H2O2), with the redox potentials of the O2/O
and
−∗
/H2O2 couples in natural waters around neutral pH poised in
O
2
such a way that O
is thermodynamically able to react with a vast
range of Fe complexes (Pierre et al., 2002). The second property
arises from its unusual electronic structure. Despite possessing an
−
odd number of valence shell electrons, the O
2 anion is resonance
stabilized by virtue of its symmetry and exhibits very little free radi-
cal character (Pauling, 1931; Neuman, 1934; Sawyer, 1991); hence I
follow the convention here of omitting the free radical symbol and
−
representing the superoxide anion as O
2 . Thus in natural waters
−
around pH 8 where the relatively unreactive O
2 dominates over

HOO
2
has a half-life of tens of seconds to hours and has been measured to
accumulate to typical concentrations in the range of 10–1000 pM

, and in the absence of other suitably reactive partners, O

(Rose et al., 2008b, 2010; Hansard et al., 2010; Shaked et al., 2010).
These lifetimes are sufﬁciently long to ensure that O
can diffuse
well away from the site of its production, enabling it to inﬂuence
local redox chemistry on a spatial scale that is biologically signif-
icant, while typical concentrations are sufﬁciently high to ensure
that it can react at environmentally relevant rates. It is this critical
−∗
balance between longevity and reactivity that renders O
2 one of
a select few extracellular reducing agents in natural waters that
are able to exert a biologically signiﬁcant inﬂuence on local redox
chemistry. The combination of the overlapping redox potentials
of the O2/O
couple with the redox potentials of wide range of
−∗
couples of Fe(II)/Fe(III) species, and the ability of O
to persist
−∗
2
at sufﬁciently high concentrations, ensures that the fates of O
2
and Fe are often closely tied in environmental systems, and also in
many intracellular biological systems, to the extent that they have
been called “partners in crime” (Liochev and Fridovich, 1999).

−∗
2 . The biological importance of O

−∗
2 has thus been known for nearly 90 years,
initially being studied largely as a chemical curiosity due to its
unusual electronic structure. In the 1960s, its importance in the
aqueous intracellular environment was established with the dis-
covery of superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme whose role is to
−∗
destroy O
2 has been further
reinforced by the discovery that SOD appears essential in aerobic
organisms (McCord et al., 1971), and is found in nearly all aerobic
forms of life (Wolfe-Simon et al., 2005) as well as many anaerobes
(Gregory et al., 1978). Production of O
in the intracellular envi-
ronment, its reactions with Fe, and effects on biological processes,
have consequently been extensively studied over the past 50 years
(see, for example, Sawyer and Gibian, 1979; Sawyer and Valen-
tine, 1981; Fridovich, 1986; Afanas’ev, 1989; Winterbourn, 1995).
−∗
However it is only since the 1980s that the potential role of O
2
in the aqueous extracellular environment has been examined in
−∗
detail. Baxter and Carey (1983) established that O
2 was formed

during photolysis of humic substances in natural waters, while fur-
ther pioneering work by Zika (Petasne and Zika, 1987; Micinski
−∗
et al., 1993) and Zaﬁriou (1990) established that O
2 occurs in
marine waters, where it may participate in reactions with a range
of biologically important compounds. There has been renewed
interest in the role of O
as a redox agent in natural waters in
the last decade primarily because the development of new highly
sensitive, rapid, and convenient analytical techniques (e.g., chemi-
luminescence of MCLA and its derivatives, with detection limits
on the order of a few picomolar; Nakano et al., 1986; Nakano,
1998; Teranishi, 2007), has allowed determination of O
con-
centrations (Rose et al., 2008a) and production rates (Godrant
et al., 2009; Milne et al., 2009) at environmentally relevant values.
−∗
The role of O
2 was ﬁrst accounted for in models of Fe specia-
tion and bioavailability in natural waters by Miller et al. (1995),
with increasing recognition of its potential importance reﬂected
by inclusion of reactions between O
and Fe in several more
recent models (Weber et al., 2005, 2007; Fan, 2008).

The primary purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed
overview of the ways in which O
in the external milieu of
microorganisms can modulate the chemical speciation of Fe, and
thereby inﬂuence its biological availability. While drawing on some
of the pioneering work on aqueous O
chemistry in the intra-
cellular environment (including its reactions with Fe), the scope
of the paper will be limited primarily to the extracellular environ-
ment in natural waters. In addition, while the paper is intended
to consider the inﬂuence of extracellular superoxide on iron redox
chemistry and bioavailability to aquatic microorganisms in all nat-
ural waters, it is relatively biased toward marine systems, because
it is in these systems that most recent advances on the subject have
occurred. While many other aspects of O
chemistry in natural
waters are still being unraveled, including its role in cycles of other
elements, this paper will consider only the role of O
in mod-
ulating Fe chemistry. In particular, the following issues will be
addressed with an attempt to identify major knowledge gaps and
critical research questions where possible:

SOURCES OF EXTRACELLULAR SUPEROXIDE IN NATURAL
WATERS
OVERVIEW
can be produced via either the one-electron
Theoretically, O
reduction of O2 or the one-electron oxidation of H2O2. In prac-
−∗
tice, reduction of O2 appears to be the dominant pathway for O
2
production in natural waters, though oxidation of H2O2 has been
shown to occur under some conditions (Moffett and Zaﬁriou,
−
1990). Like O
2 , the dioxygen molecule also possesses an unusual
electronic structure, with its lowest energetic state (ground state)
possessing two unpaired electrons with parallel spins, i.e., its
ground state is a triplet state biradical (Sawyer, 1991). Quan-
tum mechanical restrictions (the Pauli exclusion principle) dictate

−∗
2

that, under typical environmental conditions, triplet state dioxy-
gen can react only extremely slowly with molecules possessing
singlet state electronic conﬁgurations (e.g., most organic com-
pounds), but much more readily with free radicals (e.g., organic
radicals and transition metal ions), such that the reduction of
dioxygen must proceed primarily via single electron transfer steps
(Fridovich, 1998). This implies that reduction of dioxygen should
always result in O

−∗
2 production.

Attempting to identify sources of O

in oxygenated waters
is complicated, because the redox cycling of a range of relatively
labile redox couples are intimately coupled in oxygenated nat-
ural waters; thus, trying to establish which redox reaction governs
the system behavior is like the “chicken and egg” question of
which came ﬁrst. A common property of these labile redox-active
compounds (LRACs) is that they are sufﬁciently labile to accept
and donate their cargo of electrons, but also sufﬁciently long-
lived to enable transport on biologically relevant spatial scales.
Three major processes result in the occurrence of reduced LRACs
in oxygenated surface waters: abiotic photochemistry, biologi-
cal activity, and transport of reduced LRACs into (at least par-
tially) oxygenated surface waters from other environments (e.g.,
at sediment-water interfaces, discharge of anoxic groundwaters,
rainwater deposition, etc.). In the case of biological processes, the
“ultimate” source of electrons is usually (but not always) water;
in the case of abiotic photochemistry it is usually organic com-
pounds, which are themselves often (although not always) derived
from biological activity. Biological reduction in oxygenated waters
is also predominantly powered ultimately via solar energy (either
through photosynthesis, or respiration of reduced substrates that
have been previously been produced by photosynthesis). In oxy-
−∗
genated waters, O
can then be produced by reduction of O2
2
directly through one of these processes, or through reduction
−∗
of another LRAC that then reacts with O2 to yield O
2 . Thus
the vast majority of O
production in natural waters is dri-
ven ultimately by solar radiation, but the path by which this
solar energy ultimately induces reduction of O2 to O
varies
(Figure 1).

−∗
The main pathways for reduction of O2 to O
2

can thus be
broadly grouped into abiotic thermal (“dark”) processes, abiotic
photochemical processes, and biologically mediated processes.
Until recently, abiotic photochemistry in surface waters was
−∗
thought to be the major pathway for O
production in the
2
extracellular environment (Cooper et al., 1989). A growing body
of work has shown that aquatic microorganisms can also pro-
−∗
duce O
extracellularly, and that the ﬂux via this pathway may
2
be at least as great as that via abiotic photochemistry (Hansard
et al., 2010; Rose et al., 2010). However abiotic photochem-
istry is still likely to result in a non-negligible contribution to
total extracellular superoxide production (ESP) in most sunlit
waters, and in some cases may be the dominant source. The
contribution of abiotic thermal production (through oxygena-
tion of reduced LRACs) to overall rates of ESP in natural waters
is unknown, although the observation that ﬁltration to remove
cells (and other particulates) does not always completely inhibit
ESP (e.g., Rose et al., 2010) suggests that it may be substantial in
some environments. These pathways are now considered in more
detail.

ABIOTIC THERMAL (“DARK”) PRODUCTION
−∗
O
can theoretically be produced by oxygenation of a range of
2
reduced LRACs that may occur in natural waters. The oxygenation
of reduced metals [e.g., Fe(II), Mn(II), V(II), Cr(II), Cu(I), and
Co(II)] has been proposed to generally occur via the Haber–Weiss
mechanism (Haber and Weiss, 1934), resulting in the production
−
of O
2 after the ﬁrst step:

Mn+ + O2 → M(n+1)+ + O
Where Mn+

However it is not certain that these electron transfer steps always
−
result in release of the free intermediate, as O
2 and peroxide anions
(O2−
) both possess coordinative properties and may potentially
remain bound in the inner coordination sphere of the oxidized
metal center. Using computational chemistry methods, Rosso and
Morgan (2002) concluded that V2+

to react with O2 via an outer-sphere mechanism, such that O

would be formed outside the inner coordination sphere (and pre-
sumably be able to diffuse into the bulk medium as the free anion),
while Mn2+
, and hydrolyzed Fe(II) species were suggested
−
to react with O2 via an inner-sphere process, such that O
2 would
initially be coordinated to the metal center (Rosso and Morgan,
2002). Fe(II) complexed by EDTA and similar ligands also appears
to react with O2 via an inner-sphere process (Zang and van Eldik,
1990; Seibig and van Eldik, 1997).

−∗
2

Whether O

formed in this way could subsequently partici-
pate in other reactions likely depends on how rapidly it can escape
from the inner coordination sphere after electron transfer is com-
plete. It is unclear how Fe(II) in natural waters might behave, but
complexation of Fe(II) by natural organic matter (NOM) appears
to substantially modify its oxygenation kinetics (e.g., Rose and
Waite, 2003a and references therein), suggesting that further inves-
tigation of this issue is needed, ideally through both experimental
and computational means. Hereafter, it will be assumed that reduc-
−∗
tion of O2 ultimately results in production of unbound O
2 ,
even if it is initially formed in the inner coordination sphere of
a metal complex. However, this uncertainty in our understanding
−∗
of O
2 behavior needs to be resolved in order to fully evaluate the
relationship between O
and Fe bioavailabilty in natural waters.
Other reduced LRACs in natural waters include reduced sulfur
species (RSS) such as thiols and sulﬁdes, and some reduced organic
moieties. While the contribution of such species to ESP has not yet
been evaluated, RSS may be found at measurable concentrations in
oxic waters (Bowles et al., 2003; Luther and Rickard, 2005; Rickard
and Luther, 2006) and at least some RSS yield O
as a result
of oxygenation (Rao et al., 1990). Certain redox-active moieties
within NOM also react readily with oxygen (Ratasuk and Nanny,
2007; Aeschbacher et al., 2010), potentially yielding O
(discussed
further in the following section). The oxygenation chemistry (par-
ticularly thermodynamics) of a range of major LRACs present in
natural waters has recently been described in considerable detail
−∗
by Luther (2010), while the thermodynamics of the Fe/O2/O
2
system is discussed in detail by Pierre et al. (Pierre and Fontecave,
1999; Pierre et al., 2002).

PHOTOCHEMICAL PRODUCTION
−∗
Measured rates of photochemical O
production in natural
2
marine waters have typically been in the range of ∼0.3–
−1 (Petasne and Zika, 1987; Micinski et al., 1993; Shaked
500 nM h
−∗
et al., 2010). Rates of O
2 production in natural freshwaters have
not been reported in the literature, although laboratory exper-
iments using simulated freshwater systems yielded similar rates
−∗
(Garg et al., 2011a). The mechanism of abiotic photochemical O
2
production from NOM has usually been represented by a reaction
in which NOM is photoexcited to a triplet state, which subse-
quently transfers an electron to O2 to yield O
and an oxidized
organic moiety (Cooper et al., 1988, 1989):

The pathway(s) by which this overall reaction occurs are still not
certain, although the details are slowly being unraveled. While
it was thought that photoexcited NOM may eject free aquated

electrons, this now appears unlikely (Thomas-Smith and Blough,
2001). Instead, the photoexcited organic moiety can undergo a
range of possible energetic and redox transitions, particularly in
humic and fulvic substances that possess a wide range of func-
tional groups and redox potentials. The mechanism of organic
radical formation in photoexcited NOM was ﬁrst studied in detail
by Blough (1988) but, despite considerable advances over the last
20 years, the precise details of O
formation still remain elusive.
The mechanisms were thought to be similar to those involved
−∗
in O
2 production from photoexcited quinones, which have been
studied extensively (e.g., Garg et al., 2007b and references therein),
however the situation in humic and fulvic-type NOM is compli-
cated considerably by the existence of multiple chromophores (Del
Vecchio and Blough, 2002, 2004; Boyle et al., 2009) and redox-
active moieties (Aeschbacher et al., 2010), many of which may
be linked under exposure to light through charge-transfer com-
plexes (Del Vecchio and Blough, 2004). More recently, Garg et al.
(2011b) proposed a mechanism in which quinone-like moieties
within NOM are reduced by some other electron donor within the
NOM structure under solar radiation, with the reduced organic
moiety then reacting with dissolved oxygen (in either the triplet
or singlet state) to yield O

The overall process is complicated considerably by formation
−∗
of a range of other radical sinks for O
2 , but the net result is that
−∗
NOM is oxidized by O2 to yield O
through the involvement
2
of several moieties within the NOM, some of which may act as
photocatalysts.

Consistent with the concept of labile transfer of electrons
between the range of LRACs present in oxygenated waters, a sec-
ond indirect mechanism of photochemical superoxide formation
involves formation of reduced metals via ligand-to-metal charge-
transfer reactions, with subsequent oxygenation of the reduced
metal. The role of such reactions involving iron–organic com-
plexes in marine systems has been recently reviewed by Barbeau
(2006), and similar reactions can also occur with complexes of
copper (Jones et al., 1985).

BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTION
Biological production of O
in the extracellular milieu has been
reported from culture studies involving a wide range of environ-
mentally occurring aquatic microorganisms, including eukaryotic
microalgae from the class Raphidophyceae (Oda et al., 1997; Mar-
shall et al., 2002, 2005; Yamasaki et al., 2004; Garg et al., 2007a);
dinoﬂagellates and prymnesiophytes (Yamasaki et al., 2004; Mar-
shall et al., 2005); marine diatoms from the genus Thalassiosira
(Kustka et al., 2005); marine cyanobacteria from the genera Syne-
chococcus (Rose et al., 2008b), Lyngbya (Rose et al., 2005) and
Trichodesmium (Godrant et al., 2009); a marine alphaproteobac-
terium from the genus Roseobacter (Learman et al., 2011); the
freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa (Fujii et al.,
2011); the unicellular protozoan coral symbiont Symbiodinium
(Saragosti et al., 2010); fungi and yeasts including Aspergillus

−1 h

nidulans (Lara-Ortíz et al., 2003) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(Shatwell et al., 1996), as reviewed by Aguirre et al. (2005); and the
heterotrophic bacteria Paracoccus denitriﬁcans (Henry and Vig-
nais, 1980) and Escherichia coli (Korshunov and Imlay, 2006).
Rates of ESP vary enormously between these different organisms,
with the maximum reported rates being from the marine Raphi-
−1 (Oda
dophycean Chattonella marina of up to ∼5 pmol cell
et al., 1997; Garg et al., 2007a). Additionally, recent ﬁeld studies
have provided evidence from several marine environments sug-
gesting that a signiﬁcant proportion of ESP occurs via biologically
mediated processes, with measured rates of biological ESP up to
−1 in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon (Rose et al., 2010) and
1 nM h
−1 in the Gulf of Alaska (Hansard et al., 2010).
up to 20 nM h
These studies have predominantly involved either ﬁeld studies in
marine environments, or culture studies of organisms that typi-
cally inhabit marine environments, with notable exceptions being
the studies involving M. aeruginosa, P. denitriﬁcans (which is typ-
ically rather ubiquitous in soils), A. nidulans, S. cerevisiae, and E.
coli. While there is still insufﬁcient evidence to make deﬁnitive
generalizations, the occurrence of these processes across such a
wide range of microorganisms in the marine environment, cou-
pled with evidence for ESP by a range of terrestrial multicellular
organisms such as lichens (Beckett et al., 2003) and plants (Bol-
well, 1999), suggests that microbial ESP probably occurs to at least
some extent in the vast majority of surface waters.

Biological production of O

in the intracellular environment
has been studied for several decades and many of the processes
involved are well understood. In eukaryotic organisms, intracel-
−∗
lular O
2 production is believed to be highly compartmentalized,
with the majority occurring via reduction of O2 inside the mito-
chondria and through the action of NADPH oxidase (NOX)
enzymes, which are typically located inside vesicles (Auchère and
Rusnak, 2002). In photosynthetic eukaryotes, O
is also pro-
duced in signiﬁcant amounts in the chloroplasts (Lesser, 2006).
In prokaryotic organisms, which lack intracellular compartments
−∗
separated by cellular membranes, the majority of intracellular O
2
production is thought to occur during O2 reduction by the res-
piratory electron transport chain (Auchère and Rusnak, 2002),
which is also used for electron transport during photosynthesis in
photosynthetic prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria (Lesser, 2006).
It is extremely unlikely that such intracellular processes can be
−
the direct source of ESP because the polar O
2 anion is unable to
readily diffuse through the lipid bilayer that isolates the cytoplasm
•
from the external milieu (Korshunov and Imlay, 2002). HOO
can diffuse at a rate approaching that of water (permeability of

While mechanisms of biological ESP have been reasonably well
studied in human cells, mechanisms of biological ESP in aquatic
microorganisms are generally not well understood. Enzymes from
the NOX and dual oxidase (DUOX) families located at the cyto-
plasmic membrane are known to be responsible for ESP in the
majority of human cells, notably including phagocytes responsible
for the “respiratory burst” immunological defense phenomenon
(Vignais, 2002; Lambeth, 2004). Cell surface located NOX enzymes
have also been shown to be responsible for ESP in C. marina (Kim
et al., 2000), the fungus A. nidulans (Lara-Ortíz et al., 2003) and
numerous other fungi and yeasts (Aguirre et al., 2005), certain
plant cells (Torres et al., 1998; Sagi and Fluhr, 2001), and the coral
Stylophora pistillata and its symbiont Symbiodinium sp. (Saragosti
et al., 2010). Addition of diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI),
which is a speciﬁc inhibitor of NOX enzymes, has also been shown
to dramatically inhibit ESP in cultures of the diatoms Thalassiosira
weissﬂogii and T. pseudonana (Kustka et al., 2005). BLAST searches
of sequenced genomes reveal the presence of genes encoding for
polypeptide sequences similar to those found in NOX proteins in
these two diatoms (Kustka et al., 2005) and in a wide range of other
eukaryotic aquatic microorganisms, however this does not neces-
sarily indicate the occurrence of ESP mediated by NOX enzymes
in these organisms, since NOX enzymes are also found intracel-
lularly as discussed previously. BLAST searches of the genomes of
prokaryotic aquatic microorganisms reveal that such genes are not
always present, suggesting that ESP by prokaryotes may occur via
one or more other mechanisms.

Finally, it is worth reiterating that it is often difﬁcult to establish
which species is reduced ﬁrst during ESP; in the case of biological
−∗
ESP, it is not always clear whether O2 is reduced to O
2 directly
by enzymes, or whether O
is produced through oxygenation of

−∗
2

−∗
2

some other reduced LRAC formed directly by enzymatic reduc-
production in the organism’s
tion. In the case of E. coli, O
periplasm has been inferred to occur through the oxidation of
soluble, reduced quinones, with electrons originating from trans-
fer across the cytoplasmic membrane via the respiratory electron
transport chain (Korshunov and Imlay, 2006). The cell surface fer-
ric reductase system of the yeast S. cerevisiae possesses similarities
to the NOX system at the genetic level (Shatwell et al., 1996), and
is capable of reducing a range of LRACs (Kosman, 2003) including
O2 to yield O
(Lesuisse et al., 1996). The biogeochemical signif-
icance (if any) of which LRAC is reduced ﬁrst is not yet certain,
however it is clear that caution should be used when assigning
a particular mechanism for cell surface reductase activity on the
basis of genetic homology or biochemical studies conducted under
a limited set of chemical conditions.

1. As a reductant. The O

ble of directly donating electrons via an outer-sphere process
to suitable electron acceptors (e.g., transition metals and their

2. As an oxidant. HOO

is capable of oxidizing suitable electron
donors via direct electron transfer, but this is highly unfavor-

subsequent reactions resulting in their net oxidation.

be coordinated in the inner sphere of various metal ions in
aqueous solution, and can also participate in radical–radical

The role of O
as a Lewis base is restricted in natural aquatic
environments because the maximum concentration of O
that
is attainable is typically too low (due to its consumption via other
reactions) in comparison to other species to have any signiﬁcant
−∗
effect. In practice, therefore, O
2 behaves primarily as a reductant
or oxidant in natural waters. Early laboratory studies of reactions
−∗
between aqueous Fe and O
typically used pulse radiolysis to

generate O
and UV–visible spectrophotometry to observe the
subsequent reactions (Jayson et al., 1969, 1973; Buettner et al.,
1983; Bull et al., 1983; Rush and Bielski, 1985). While useful in
−∗
understanding the chemistry of Fe and O
2 , results from these
studies must be applied to environmental systems with caution
because the use of high concentrations of both Fe and O
could
favor reactions that are not important at lower, environmentally
relevant concentrations. This is particularly true for oxidation of
−∗
Fe(II) by O
2 , where the initial step appears to typically involve
−
coordination of O
2 in the inner sphere of Fe(II). Furthermore,
natural systems involve a host of other competing reactions due
to the range of other species present.

was ﬁrst speciﬁcally studied by Voelker and Sedlak (1995). They

concluded that O
functioned primarily as a reductant of Fe(III)
2
over the pH range 5–8 (where O
), and
that substantial amounts of Fe(II) could be expected to be pro-
duced in certain environmental systems as a result of this process.
More recent studies have typically used lower concentrations of Fe
and O
that are more representative of what is typically found
in natural systems, largely due to the possibilities afforded by the
development of new techniques such as the MCLA chemilumines-
cence method, and have considered a range of different conditions
that are more relevant to natural waters. Fe species can be broadly
classiﬁed in such systems into three main groups:

−∗
2

1. Mononuclear inorganic complexes, which include hydrolysis
species and a range of relatively weak complexes with small,
commonly occurring inorganic ligands such as chloride, sulfate,
bromide, ﬂuoride, carbonate, and phosphate. These complexes
interconvert rapidly compared to the other reactions we will
consider, and may thus be assumed to be at equilibrium at all
times.

2. Mononuclear organic complexes, which occur with a wide
range of naturally occurring organic ligands such as humic and
fulvic-type materials, polysaccharides, siderophores, and other
biologically produced compounds.

3. Polynuclear complexes, which include amorphous oxyhydrox-
ide solids, various iron minerals, and aggregates containing
varying proportions of iron, organic material, and potentially
other species.

Within each of these classes, individual Fe atoms may be present
in either the Fe(II) or Fe(III) redox state, and the transformations
between these redox states may be mediated by O

(Figure 2).

the standard redox potential of the O2/O
couple can vary con-
siderably from +120 mV at pH(cid:4) 4.8 to −160 mV at pH(cid:5) 4.8
(Sawyer, 1991). In the majority of natural surface waters, which
are in the neutral to slightly alkaline pH range, the standard
couple is thus −160 mV. There-
redox potential of the O2/O
fore, under standard conditions at around neutral pH, O
is
a mild reducing agent. In contrast, the standard redox poten-
tials of various Fe(II)/Fe(III) couples vary from <−1000 to
>+1000 mV depending on pH and complex speciation (Pierre
and Fontecave, 1999; Pierre et al., 2002). Despite the overlap
between the standard redox potentials of the O2/O
couple and
those of many Fe(II)/Fe(III) species redox couples, an impor-
tant caveat when considering the feasibility of redox reactions
is that these redox potentials apply to standard conditions, i.e.,
]= [Fe(II)] species= [Fe(III)] species. As discussed
in detail by Pierre et al. (2002), such conditions are irrelevant
in most natural systems. Under conditions typical for a neu-
tral air-saturated surface water (pH 7 and [O2]= 250 μM), the

strong Fe(III) complexes, such as that formed with EDTA in fresh-
water, provided that the ligand also forms a relatively strong Fe(II)
complex. This contrasts with the case of DFB, which forms a
much stronger complex with Fe(III) than with Fe(II), where reduc-
tion of Fe(III)L to Fe(II)L is thermodynamically feasible only at
exceedingly low Fe(II)L:Fe(III)L ratios.
However reduction of Fe(III) by O

mentally important even when the thermodynamically permissi-
ble concentration of Fe(II)L is much less than that of Fe(III)L,
because many microorganisms acquire iron from the dissolved

species. A more useful thermodynamic test, then, is whether

can increase the proportion of dissolved inorganic Fe, given
that it is these forms of Fe that are usually the immediate sub-
strate for uptake by aquatic microorganisms (Morel et al., 2008).

While these types of calculations are useful for assessing the
−∗
thermodynamic driving force and consequent feasibility of O
2
as a reductant for Fe, they are really only useful to provide a
general context for such reactions. It is often overlooked that envi-
ronmental systems are not always at equilibrium (and in some
environments, are never at equilibrium), and as a consequence,
the usefulness of thermodynamics in such systems is limited. In
particular, processes that can perturb the system can increase the
thermodynamic feasibility, such as removal of Fe(II) by biological
uptake (Pierre and Fontecave, 1999). In this case, a lower Fe(II)
concentration can be maintained, increasing the driving force for
reduction (Eq. 9). Because such systems are at steady-state rather
than a true equilibrium, thermodynamics cannot be used to pre-
dict what the ﬁnal system will look like, but if the composition [e.g.,
−∗
concentrations of O
2 , O2, Fe(II), and Fe(III)] of the steady-state
system is known, it can be used to understand the energetics of the
system. However being able to predict what this steady-state system
will look like is usually a major objective in environmental systems,
and this can only be achieved by a more rigorous kinetic analysis.

Fe hydrolysis and sulfate complexation). Extrapolation of these

In systems where organic complexation and/or polynuclear
complex formation occur, a single conditional rate constant for
Fe(III) reduction and another for Fe(II) oxidation by O
cannot
be derived; it is necessary to separately account for the reactions
−∗
of O
2 with mononuclear inorganic Fe and at least one organic
and/or polynuclear Fe complex. Studies in model systems contain-
ing a single, well characterized synthetic ligand have conﬁrmed
that reduction of Fe(III) by O
around neutral pH can occur via
direct reduction of the complex (denoted “non-dissociative reduc-
tion,” or NDR), or via dissociation of the complex with subsequent
reduction of the liberated Fe(III)
(denoted “dissociative reduc-
tion,” or DR; Garg et al., 2007c,d; Fujii et al., 2008), as shown in
Figure 2. The relative importance of these two pathways for Fe(III)
reduction depends on the relative rates of complex dissociation,
−∗
complex formation, Fe(III)
2 , and Fe(III)L reduc-
−∗
tion by O
2 . Under steady-state conditions where most Fe(III) is
present in complexed form, the net rate of Fe(III) reduction by
NDR is simply:

All parameters in this equation will be inﬂuenced to varying
extents by medium conditions (e.g., pH and ionic strength). Addi-
tionally, for a given ligand, the system pH, major ion composition,
ligand concentration, and O
concentration will have speciﬁc
effects on particular parameters. The relative importance of NDR
compared to DR will be increased by:
+

1. Decreasing concentrations of H

(i.e., higher pH) or cations
such as Ca2+
; the presence of these species will lower
“free” ligand concentration, [L], by occupying sites within lig-
ands that might otherwise complex Fe, thus decreasing the
numerator of Eq. 15.

and Mg2+

2. Increasing ligand concentrations; this will increase the numer-

ator of Eq. 15.

2 concentrations; this will increase the numerator

3. Increasing O

of Eq. 15.

The afﬁnity of the ligand for Fe(III) also has a major effect on
the relative importance of DR and NDR, but this effect is com-
plicated because two factors act in opposite ways. First, increasing
the Fe(III) binding strength of the ligand will tend to increase
kf,Fe(III)L (increasing the numerator of Eq. 15) and/or decrease
kd,Fe(III)L (decreasing the denominator of Eq. 15); this leads to
a relative increase in the importance of NDR relative to DR.
−∗
However weaker Fe(III) complexes typically react faster with O
2
than stronger complexes, as observed empirically for a range of
synthetic Fe-binding ligands (Rose and Waite, 2005), such that
increasing Fe(III) binding strength of the ligand will tend to
decrease kred,Fe(III)L. Rate constants for reduction of organic com-
plexes of Fe(III) by O
at pH 8 were found to be several orders
of magnitude smaller than those for reduction of Fe(III)

from ∼104 M
DFB to ∼2× 106 M
−1 for reduction of the relatively weak
complex Fe(III)-salicylate (Rose and Waite, 2005). This trend is
consistent with Marcus Theory for outer-sphere electron trans-
fer processes (see Marcus and Sutin (1985) for a detailed review),
which is the process by which reduction of transition metal com-
plexes by O
is thought to occur (Weinstock, 2008). In fact
Marcus Theory relates the rate constant to the ratio of stability
constants for the Fe(II) and Fe(III) complexes, not just the stabil-
ity of the Fe(III) complex alone (Marcus and Sutin, 1985); however
as ligands that form stronger complexes with Fe(III) often form
weaker complexes with Fe(II), there is generally a consistent trend
for slower reduction of stronger Fe(III) complexes by O

Polynuclear complexes are also able to be reduced by O

demonstrated in laboratory studies with amorphous ferric oxyhy-
droxide (AFO; Fujii et al., 2006) and in ﬁeld studies with Saharan
dust in seawater (Heller and Croot, 2011). A similar competition
between DR and NDR would be expected to occur for polynu-
clear complexes. Fujii et al. (2006) found that in both very freshly
formed AFO (which has a relatively small conditional stability
constant) and aged AFO (which has a much larger conditional
stability constant), Fe(II) production during reduction of AFO

2 occurred almost entirely via DR. These experiments were
performed in seawater at pH 8.2 using total Fe concentrations of
50–500 nM, which is a reasonable range in coastal marine systems,
−∗
but using higher steady-state O
concentrations than would be
2
expected in most environments (∼20 nM cf. 0.1–1 nM measured
−∗
in marine waters). These higher O
concentrations would tend
2
to increase the importance of NDR, which implies that at the
lower O
concentrations measured in natural waters to date, the
process will almost certainly occur via DR. Given that aged AFO
has a relatively large conditional stability constant, NDR might be
expected to play a more substantial role, however polynuclear com-
plexes (unlike mononuclear complexes) may permit extremely
rapid intramolecular electron transfer from relatively labile Fe
atoms (e.g., at the AFO surface) to less labile Fe atoms within
the polymeric structure (Katz et al., 2010), inhibiting the release
of Fe(II) potentially formed through this pathway. Whether this
or some other phenomenon is responsible for the dominance of
DR during reduction of aged AFO remains untested, however, and
will require further experimental studies to resolve.

At lower pH values (3 and 5), HOO

is a major oxidant of Fe(II)
−
(Voelker et al., 1997). Around pH 8, where O
2 dominates over
HOO
, Fujii et al. (2010b) determined rate constants for oxida-
tion of complexes between Fe(II) and humic-type organic ligands
in the range 6.9–23× 105 M
−∗
−1, which were ∼4–5
by O
2
orders of magnitude greater than corresponding rate constants
for oxidation of the complexes by O2. Given a typical dissolved
O2 concentration of ∼250 μM for natural waters in equilibrium
−∗
with atmospheric O2, this implies that O
2 would be a negligibly
−∗
minor oxidant of these Fe(II) complexes at the picomolar O
2
concentrations that have been measured in natural waters. In con-
−∗
trast, Heller and Croot (2010) suggested that O
2 may react with
naturally occurring organic Fe(II) complexes found in the South-
ern Ocean with rate constants of up to ∼5× 107 M
−1, which
is around an order of magnitude greater than those for the humic-
−∗
type complexes (Fujii et al., 2010b). This would suggest that O

might contribute signiﬁcantly to Fe(II) oxidation at the higher
range of environmentally relevant O
concentrations; however
this can not be evaluated directly without also knowing the kinet-
ics of reaction between the Fe(II) complexes and O2, which were
not determined in the Southern Ocean study. To date, oxidation of
−∗
polynuclear Fe(II) by O
2 has not been studied directly, although
such a reaction would seem less environmentally relevant than
−∗
reduction of polynulcear Fe(III) by O
2 , given the weaker ten-
dency of Fe(II) to form polynuclear species. However, it is clear
that more studies of the oxidation of organically complexed and

polynuclear Fe(II) by O
are required to better constrain the
−∗

potential importance of O
as an oxidant of Fe(II) in natural

waters.

INDIRECT EFFECTS OF REACTIONS BETWEEN SUPEROXIDE AND IRON
−∗
While being primarily concerned with the effect of O
on Fe
2
speciation, it is also worth brieﬂy considering the ability of reac-
−∗
tions between O
2 and Fe to generate other reactive intermediates,
which may be biologically important. Perhaps the major such
process is the Haber–Weiss cycle, in which O
and Fe promote

It has since been shown that this reaction does not occur

−∗

The biological importance of these processes lies in the abil-
and/or Fe(IV) to oxidize a wide range of biologically
ity of HO
important molecules, and constitutes one of the main pathways to
−∗
oxidative stress. This only occurs when O
is reduced by Fe(II)
2
to form H2O2 [i.e., when O
acts as an oxidant of Fe(II)] which,
as discussed in the previous section, appears to be negligible at
−∗
O
concentrations that have so far been measured in natural
2
waters. A second potential consequence of this series of reactions
is the possibility that O2 formed in the reaction shown in Eq. 17
is in the excited singlet state rather than the triplet ground state.
Singlet state dioxygen (1O2) is a powerful, but rather selective, oxi-
dant of a range of biologically important molecules (Briviba et al.,
1997). Formation of 1O2 from oxidation of O
is only possible
with a sufﬁciently powerful oxidant (Koppenol, 1976), which may
or may not be satisﬁed by different Fe(II) species (Nanni et al.,
1981).

Extracellular superoxide and iron chemistry

INFLUENCE OF EXTRACELLULAR SUPEROXIDE ON IRON
BIOAVAILABILITY AND MICROBIAL IRON NUTRITION
SUPEROXIDE: A FORCE FOR GOOD OR EVIL?
−∗
O
is frequently associated with the concept of oxidative stress in
2
cells, and has consequently developed a reputation as an enemy of
healthy biological functioning. The detrimental effect of intracel-
−∗
lular O
can largely be attributed to two main types of processes
2
(Fridovich, 1986, 1998; Cadenas, 1989; Auchère and Rusnak, 2002;
Lesser, 2006):

1. interference with critical redox processes by adversely inﬂuenc-
ing the redox state of enzymes (particularly including enzymes
containing iron) and other smaller molecules with speciﬁc
biochemical functions; and

2. initiation of radical chain reactions, including as a precursor to
, Fe(IV), and 1O2 via

much more reactive species such as HO
the processes described previously.

•

−∗
2

Adverse effects caused by extracellular O
in a typical aquatic
environment near neutral pH could presumably result from simi-
lar processes that cause adverse effects inside the cell. The potential
for processes in the extracellular environment to adversely affect
−∗
cells is limited by the inability of O
and many of its more reac-
2
tive derivatives to cross cell membranes, which inhibits or prevents
these species from reacting with the vast majority of enzymes
and other biological molecules used for normal cellular function.
Additionally, concentrations of Fe (and other promoters of free
radical production) are usually much lower in the extracellular
environment than the intracellular environment, which decreases
formation rates of potentially damaging reactive derivatives by
slowing reaction kinetics. The presence of other potential sinks
can also help scavenge these reactive derivatives and thus confer
additional protection to the cell.

−∗
However, in some cases, extracellular O
2

and/or Fe(IV) at substantial rates, O

is capable of inﬂict-
ing cellular damage and may even be deliberately used in this
fashion either to defend against invasions by other cells [e.g., the
“oxidative burst” produced by human phagocyte cells (Vignais,
2002)] or as an agent of cellular warfare, as has been suggested
some raphidophyceans such as C. marina (Oda et al., 1992). A
frequently observed factor in these situations is the production of
−∗
large amounts of O
2 at relatively rapid rates. This can be rational-
ized on the basis that in order to produce H2O2 and subsequently
−∗
•
HO
2 must be reduced at
−∗
substantial rates, as O
2 production rates need to be fast enough to
sustain relatively rapid formation of both H2O2 (through reduc-
−∗
tion of O
2 ) and Fe(II) (or other reduced species) to oxidize H2O2
−∗
•
to HO
2 pro-
[or to yield Fe(IV)]. In contrast, relatively low O
duction rates will result in relatively low H2O2 production rates
and also relatively low concentrations of Fe(II) (or other reduced
species), such that H2O2 is more likely to decay via pathways that
do not result in HO
or Fe(IV) formation. Thus, at the picomo-
−∗
lar concentrations typically encountered in natural waters, O
2
is unlikely to be particularly detrimental for aquatic microorgan-
isms. This notion is further supported by evidence that a wide
range of cells use O
as a signaling molecule at low concentra-
tions (Buetler et al., 2004), although given the limited number of
−∗
studies on the roles and/or effects of extracellular O

is both thermodynamically and kinetically capable of reducing
a wide range of Fe(III) species to Fe(II), thereby potentially
increasing Fe bioavailability.

CAN EXTRACELLULAR SUPEROXIDE PRODUCTION INCREASE Fe
BIOAVAILABILITY?
The analysis in Section “Kinetics and Mechanisms” separately con-
sidered rates of Fe(III) reduction and rates of Fe(II) oxidation by
−∗
O
for a range of different forms of Fe. While this provides use-
2
ful insight into the mechanisms by which O
can inﬂuence Fe
speciation, and the relative importance of these various pathways
under various conditions, the most important factor from the
perspective of Fe bioavailability is the net result of these processes.
Most organisms in natural waters are thought to use the mononu-
clear inorganic complexes, collectively represented as Fe(II)
and
Fe(III)
, as the substrate that is directly internalized by the cell
(Morel et al., 2008). Thus while Fe from the other pools may
be bioavailable in the sense that Fe contained within them may
ultimately ﬁnd its way into the cell, this can only occur after con-
(cid:6)
version to Fe(II)
to inﬂuence Fe
bioavailability therefore depends largely on whether its produc-
tion increases the concentration of Fe(II)
at or
near the sites of cellular uptake of these species.

are independent of ligand type (consistent with control of complex
formation by water loss kinetics, i.e., the complexes form via a per-

the electrostatic charge on L does not vary between different ligand

Under the conditions of the example above, it is clear that
steady-state concentrations of O
that are typical of those mea-
sured in natural waters have the potential to signiﬁcantly increase
Fe bioavailability. The same approach can be readily applied to nat-
ural waters with differing Fe concentrations, because the steady-
state concentrations of Fe(II)
are simply proportional
to [Fe]T when all other parameters remain constant (Eqs A28 and
A29 in Appendix). However, there are several other factors that

non-linear manner.

(cid:6)

3. Real ligands do not all form 1:1 complexes with Fe, nor do
they all possess equal electrostatic charges. For this and other
reasons, real complexes do not conform precisely to the Eigen–
Wilkins mechanism, which means that values of kf,Fe(III)L and
kf,Fe(II)L will not be independent of ligand type, and values of
kd,Fe(III)L and kd,Fe(II)L will differ even between ligands with
identical values of K Fe(III)L and K Fe(II)L. Similarly, real com-
plexes do not conform precisely to Marcus Theory, such that
values of kO2,org and kred,org will also differ between ligands
with identical values of K Fe(III)L and K Fe(II)L.

DO ORGANISMS EXPLOIT SUPEROXIDE CHEMISTRY TO FACILITATE Fe
ACQUISITION?
Since O
can persist in circumneutral natural waters at pico-
molar concentrations due to biological and other processes, and
(cid:6)
can increase bioavailable Fe(II)
concentrations under
some such conditions, the potential exists for organisms to exploit
this chemistry to facilitate Fe acquisition. A simple test for the
−∗
involvement of O
in Fe uptake is whether addition of SOD
2
to the external milieu decreases Fe uptake by an organism, on
−∗
the basis that SOD will scavenge O
and thereby prevent its
2
reaction with Fe. This assay has been used to demonstrate the
−∗
involvement of O
in Fe uptake under particular conditions by
2
several aquatic microorganisms in culture studies, including C.
marina (Garg et al., 2007a), L. majuscula (Rose et al., 2005), and
M. aeruginosa (Fujii et al., 2010a). The assay has also been used to
−∗
demonstrate that O
2 was apparently not involved in Fe uptake
in experiments with cultures of the diatoms T. weissﬂogii and T.
pseudonana (Kustka et al., 2005), and the green alga Chlorella
kessleri (Middlemiss et al., 2001).

−∗
2

While the SOD addition assay would seem robust, care must be
taken when interpreting and extrapolating results for three main
reasons. First, in organisms possessing compartments external to
the cytoplasmic membrane (e.g., the periplasm of Gram nega-
tive bacteria) or producing extracellular microenvironments (e.g.,
the glycocalyx of C. marina), SOD may not be able to access the
site(s) of extracellular O
production or Fe reduction due to
the large size of the molecule (molecular mass ∼32 kDa). Thus if,
−∗
for example, O
2 production and subsequent Fe reduction and
uptake were occurring in the periplasm of a Gram negative organ-
ism, the SOD addition assay would not result in inhibition of Fe
uptake. Second, SOD concentrations employed in these assays are
−∗
often much greater than those theoretically needed to ensure O
2
concentrations are negligibly small in homogeneous solution. The
need to use such large SOD concentrations may be partly related
to failure to account for compartmentalization or other spatial
heterogeneity, but may potentially be due to as yet unknown non-
speciﬁc interference with or inhibition of Fe uptake. Finally, as
seen above, O
is only able to substantially increase Fe bioavail-
ability under certain conditions. Therefore it is risky to generalize
the potential role of O
in Fe uptake based on culture studies
under only a few conditions. This has been well demonstrated in

−∗
2

−∗
2

−∗
2

studies on C. marina (Garg et al., 2007a) and M. aeruginosa (Fujii
−∗
2 was found to aid Fe uptake under some
et al., 2010a) in which O
conditions, but not others. To date there have been no reports of
ﬁeld experiments to test the role of O
in Fe uptake under more
environmentally relevant conditions than those used in culture
studies, but such experiments would seem essential to truly test
−∗
the potential role of O
in Fe uptake by aquatic microorganisms
2
in their natural habitats.

−∗
2

Understanding the potential role of O

in Fe uptake is further
complicated by the issue of which comes ﬁrst: Fe reduction with
−∗
subsequent O
2 generation by oxygenation of the resulting Fe(II),
−∗
or O
2 generation with subsequent reduction of Fe. Reductive Fe
uptake is now recognized to be a major strategy for Fe acquisition
by a wide range of aquatic microorganisms (e.g., Maldonado and
Price, 2001; Davey et al., 2003), facilitated by a general class of
enzymes known as ferrireductases (Schröder et al., 2003; Kranzler
et al., 2011). While extracellular ferrireductases vary in structure
and location, in some cases at least they are capable of reducing
−∗
O2 to O
in addition to reducing Fe(III) to Fe(II) (Lesuisse et al.,
2
1996). Middlemiss et al. (2001) demonstrated in experiments with
−∗
C. kessleri that while both Fe(II) and O
2 were generated by the
organism, SOD addition had no effect on Fe uptake rates, implying
that Fe reduction by cell surface reductases was the ﬁrst step in the
process. It was thus suggested that rates of Fe reduction at the cell
surface far exceeded rates of Fe uptake, and that the fate of Fe(II)
in the bulk solution had no discernible inﬂuence on the kinet-
ics of Fe uptake by the organism. Kustka et al. (2005) also found
that addition of exogenous SOD had no effect on Fe uptake rates
by T. weissﬂogii and T. pseudonana, despite a measurable increase
in Fe(II) production in the bulk solution due to the presence of
−∗
O
2 . It was thus suggested that under these experimental condi-
tions, O
without
changing the total Fe
concentration, which is ultimately the sub-
−∗
strate for uptake. In these cases, it would appear that O
2 was
neither required nor helpful for reductive Fe uptake, despite being
produced in the process.
−∗
2

Regardless of whether the initial process is Fe reduction or O

simply converted existing Fe(III)

into Fe(II)

−∗
2

production, its occurrence at or near the cell surface will likely lead
−∗
to gradients in Fe(II) and O
2 concentrations away from the cell. If
Fe(II) is released from a ferrireductase enzyme into solution prior
to uptake, and the timescale of diffusive processes is faster than
that of reactive processes, then the spatial distributions of Fe(II)
−∗
and O
at steady-state should be similar in both cases. How-
2
ever if the diffusive timescale is slower than the reactive timescale,
then we would expect signiﬁcantly higher Fe(II) concentrations
near the cell surface in the former case, leading to faster Fe uptake
kinetics and implying that reactions between Fe and O
should
have only a limited effect on Fe uptake kinetics. In the former
case, it may also be possible that Fe(II) is passed directly from the
ferrireductase enzyme to an uptake site, in which case we might
expect very little (if any) Fe(II) to diffuse into the bulk solution.
At present, the only model for reductive Fe uptake that considers
spatial heterogeneity at the cellular scale is the Fe(II)s model of
Shaked et al. (2005), which considers two pools of Fe: a pool near
the cell surface, and another in the bulk solution. More detailed
reacto-diffusive modeling would appear needed to quantitatively
understand differences in behavior of the ferrireductase system

Extracellular superoxide and iron chemistry

versus a system in which Fe reduction is driven initially by O
generation at the cell surface.

UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS CAN EXTRACELLULAR SUPEROXIDE
PRODUCTION AID IRON ACQUISITION?
From the analysis and discussion in the previous sections, an
attempt can be made to answer the general question of when will
O

when:

2 assist in Fe uptake? Generally, O

(cid:6)

1. [Fe

]T is already high relative to cellular needs. Under these con-
ditions, Fe uptake systems are likely to be near saturation, such
(cid:6)
that further increasing [Fe
]T will not substantially increase Fe
uptake rates.

2. Organic ligands form strong complexes with Fe(II) relative to
those formed with Fe(III). Under these conditions, reduction
(cid:6)
of Fe(III) to Fe(II) will decrease [Fe
]T and therefore hinder Fe
acquisition.

3. The rate at which O

is reduced to H2O2 is relatively fast.
Under these conditions, a high rate of O
production (by
whatever means) is required to sustain a steady-state concen-
−∗
tration of O
]T. Furthermore,
2
relatively rapid production of H2O2 may promote formation
of biologically harmful species such as HO

(cid:6)
that is sufﬁcient to increase [Fe

4. A large proportion of O
2

is consumed through reactions with
species that outcompete Fe(III) for O
and remove electrons
from the reactive pool by formation of relatively stable reduced
species, e.g., other trace metals and organic radicals. In this case,
the efﬁciency of electron transfer from O
to Fe may again be
relatively low and the process expensive for cells.

Thus, extracellular O
−∗
2
trations in the absence of O
2 would be low in terms of biological
requirements; reduction of any Fe(III) complexes results in for-
mation of relatively weak Fe(II) complexes; and rates of reduction
−∗
of O
to H2O2 are relatively low. However while these conditions
2
would appear beneﬁcial for cells in terms of promoting Fe bioavail-
ability, this does not mean that cells would necessarily deliberately
use ESP to assist in Fe acquisition; establishing the use of ESP
in such a way would at least require evidence of regulation at
the genetic level, which has not been convincingly demonstrated
to date.

What types of environments would meet these criteria? Many
(cid:6)
marine waters are likely to do so, given that Fe
is often present at
low concentrations due to limited Fe supply and strong organic
complexation of Fe(III) (e.g., Rue and Bruland, 1995). It is not
certain that the corresponding Fe(II) complexes would always be
relatively weak in comparison, but limited measurements of the
strength of natural complexes in coastal waters suggests this is
likely in some cases at least. Additionally, rates of O
reduction
to H2O2 would appear relatively low in relatively “clean” marine
waters based on reported rates of H2O2 production (Palenik and
−∗
Morel, 1988; Herut et al., 1998) and O
2 decay (Hansard et al.,
2010; Rose et al., 2010; Shaked et al., 2010). Many carbonate-
buffered freshwaters might also satisfy these criteria, but there
is insufﬁcient information in the literature to draw deﬁnitive
−∗
conclusions. Extracellular O
2 might also be able to increase

is unlikely

to increase Fe bioavailability in acidic environments (where Fe
−∗
solubility would be higher and rates of O
reduction to H2O2 rel-
2
atively rapid) or waters rich in trace metal and/or organic species
−∗
that could scavenge O
2 much more effectively than Fe (e.g.,
highly polluted natural waters or some engineered aquatic sys-
tems). Finally, these criteria may not always be met in laboratory
cultures. In particular, the widely used ligand EDTA forms rather
strong complexes with Fe(II) in comparison to complexes with
Fe(III) at pH 8 (Table 1), which will limit the ability of extra-

2 has
previously been observed to have little or no effect on Fe bioavail-
ability in cultures where Fe is complexed by EDTA (Kustka et al.,
2005; Garg et al., 2007a), which may be at least partly attributable
to this effect, although factors including spatial heterogeneity may
also be involved. Therefore, while useful for understanding partic-
ular processes, care must be taken in extrapolating such results to
natural aquatic systems where ligands with similar properties are
unlikely to dominate.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
−∗
is produced in the extracellular environment predomi-
O
2
nantly through univalent reduction of oxygen. This occurs mostly
through (i) the oxygenation of relatively labile reduced com-
pounds such as Fe(II) and Cu(I); (ii) abiotic photochemical oxi-
dation of organic compounds; and (iii) biological production by
a wide range of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Biological
ESP appears primarily due to the activity of cell surface reductase
enzymes that export electrons from the cell either directly to O2, or
to other labile electron acceptors that subsequently react with O2 to
−∗
yield O
2 .These processes can together maintain an environmen-
−∗
tally signiﬁcant concentration of O
2 in the extracellular milieu.
The chemistry of Fe and O
is intimately coupled in many oxy-
−∗
genated waters. O
is thermodynamically and mechanistically
2
capable of reducing a wide range of forms of Fe(III) under typical
environmental conditions, including inorganic Fe(III)
, organi-
cally complexed Fe(III), and even solid (polynuclear) forms of
Fe(III). Conversely, the oxidation of Fe(II) by O2 is thought to
produce O
(although this has not yet been conclusively demon-
−∗
strated). While O
can also oxidize Fe(II), at sub-nanomolar O
2
concentrations in neutral to alkaline solutions, this is likely to be
a relatively unimportant reaction because O2 will oxidize Fe(II) at
much faster rates.

The net effect of O

much on the thermodynamic ability of O
to reduce various

Fe(II) (e.g., organic Fe(II) complexes) are relatively labile com-
pared to the dominant form(s) of Fe(III). In a spatially homoge-
neous system, it is unimportant whether cell surface ferrireduc-
−∗
tases reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) that then reacts with O2 to yield O

then reacts with Fe(III) to yield Fe(II), unless ferrireductases pass
Fe(II) directly to the uptake site without release of free Fe(II).
In such a system, direct reduction of O2 by cells maybe more
effective in increasing Fe bioavailability, since rates of O2 reduc-
tion by an oxygen reductase may be faster than rates of Fe(III)
reduction by a ferrireductase simply because the concentration
of O2 is much greater than that of Fe(III) in most oxygenated
environments. However in a spatially heterogeneous system, a
ferrireductase mechanism would likely be more efﬁcient due to
biological compartmentalization and diffusion resulting in higher
concentrations of Fe(II)
near the site of cellular uptake compared
−∗
to in the bulk solution. Understanding the chemistry of Fe and O
2
at a detailed mechanistic level, and a more rigorous understand-
ing of the role of physical transport processes, is needed to fully
assess the potential role of O
in increasing Fe bioavailability

(cid:6)

in a range of aquatic environments. On the basis of the infor-
mation presently available, however, it seems that extracellular
−∗
O
2 has the potential to signiﬁcantly increase Fe bioavailability
under some conditions at least and may therefore be an impor-
tant part of the complicated process of Fe acquisition by aquatic
organisms.

Extracellular superoxide and iron chemistry

APPENDIX
ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF CHEMISTRY OF REACTIONS BETWEEN SUPEROXIDE AND IRON
Thermodynamics
Application of the Nernst equation, using measured or estimated values for the concentrations of the various species, is required to
determine the environmental redox potential at 25˚C:
E = E0 + 59 log([Ox]/[Red])

couple is +335 mV when [O

where Ox represents the oxidized form of the species, Red the reduced form, and E and E0 are in millivolt.

Consequently, under conditions typical for a neutral air-saturated surface water (pH 7 and [O2]= 250 μM), the actual redox poten-
] = 1 nM. While Pierre et al. (2002) emphasize
tial of the O2/O
the importance of using actual concentrations of O2 and O
to calculate relevant redox potentials, an equally important consideration
for the thermodynamic reducibility of a particular form of Fe by O
is the concentration of relevant Fe(II) and Fe(III) species. This is
well demonstrated by considering the case of some organic Fe complexes, which we denote as Fe(II)L in the reduced state and Fe(III)L
in the oxidized state. Since:
E0 = 59 log K

DETAILS OF SPATIALLY HOMOGENEOUS STEADY-STATE MODEL FOR Fe(cid:3) CONCENTRATIONS AS A FUNCTION OF SUPEROXIDE CONCENTRATIONS
The steady-state concentrations of the Fe species for the system shown in Figure 3 are controlled by eight parameters: kf,Fe(III)L, kd,Fe(III)L,
kf,Fe(II)L, kd,Fe(II)L, kO2,inorg, kred,inorg, kO2,org, and kred,org, and can be determined by solving the resulting rate law equations for each
Fe species subject to the steady-state condition d/dt= 0. The four resulting equations are not independent, so we also need to invoke a
mass balance equation for Fe, leading to the following system of independent equations that must be solved in order to calculate the
steady-state concentrations of the Fe species in the system:
(cid:3)(cid:2)
Fe (III)(cid:6)(cid:3) − kO2,inorg [O2]
Fe (II)(cid:6)(cid:3) + kd,Fe(II)L [Fe (II) L] − kf,Fe(II)L [L]
Fe (II)(cid:6)(cid:3) = kred,inorg

Fe (II)(cid:6)(cid:3) − kred,inorg

(cid:3)
[Fe (II) L] = kred,org
[Fe (III) L] − kO2,org [O2] [Fe (II) L] + kf,Fe(II)L [L]
Fe (II)(cid:6)(cid:3) + [Fe (III) L] + [Fe (II) L] = [Fe]T
Fe (III)(cid:6)(cid:3) +(cid:2)
2 ) as constants. In oxygen-saturated waters at 25˚C, [O2]= 250 μM (cid:5) [Fe]T in most cases. Assuming [L] is constant
−∗
(L, O2, and O
is also reasonable provided [L](cid:5) [Fe]T, which is frequently the case, but even if not we can specify a constant amount of free, excess
ligand for the present purposes provided the majority of Fe remains organically complexed under the range of scenarios investigated
] and consider the effect
(which will be seen to be the case, as shown in Figure 4). Finally, we will specify a constant steady-state [O
of this value on steady-state [Fe(III)

The number of variables can be further simpliﬁed by assuming a 1:1 Fe:L ratio for Fe(II)L and Fe(III)L, that the complex formation
rate constants are independent of ligand type (consistent with control of complex formation by water loss kinetics, i.e., the complexes
form via a perfect Eigen–Wilkins mechanism (Eigen and Wilkins, 1965) in which the electrostatic charge on L does not vary between
