Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most frequent AIDS-deﬁning cancer worldwide. KS-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of KS, and the virus is also associated with
two lymphoproliferative diseases. Both KS and KSHV-associated lymphomas, are cancers
of unique molecular composition. They represent a challenge for cancer treatment and
an opportunity to identify new mechanisms of transformation. Here, we review the cur-
rent clinical insights into KSHV-associated cancers and discuss scientiﬁc insights into the
pathobiology of KS, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman’s disease.

KAPOSI SARCOMA
Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an endothelial cell lineage tumor that is
caused by KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Clinically, multiple
manifestations of KS have been observed. It is unclear whether
these different clinical forms have the same molecular make-up
and whether they would respond to the same treatment. The clin-
ical forms of KS are classic KS, endemic KS, transplant-associated
KS, and AIDS-associated KS. In the era of effective antiretrovi-
ral therapy (ART), we now also encounter a new type of KS that
is HIV associated, but no longer AIDS-deﬁning as it appears in
individuals with near-normal CD4 counts.

Classic KS was described by M. Kaposi. He identiﬁed ﬁve
patients exhibiting hemorrhagic sarcoma of the skin as well as sar-
coma of internal organs upon postmortem examination (Kaposi,
1872; Abada et al., 2008). Note that Kaposi described an aggressive
tumor in older – HIV-negative – men, whereas to date the classic
form of KS is considered to be an indolent disease restricted to the
skin. It also predominantly occurs in older men of Mediterranean
and Eastern European origin. One report suggests a hereditary
component for classic KS (Guttman-Yassky et al., 2004).

Endemic KS was described as occurring in sub-Saharan Africa
before the emergence of HIV (Maclean, 1963). African KS is his-
tologically indistinguishable from other forms of KS. It tends to
be aggressive, and it is regularly seen in children (Slavin et al.,
1970). Endemic KS is the leading cancer of children in some
African countries owing to near universal infection with KSHV
and other yet to be identiﬁed co-factors. It is as frequent, and
as characteristic for the “Malaria belt” as Epstein–Barr-Virus
(EBV)-associated endemic Burkitt lymphoma (BL). The only
treatment, if available, is radiation and/or cytotoxic chemotherapy.
In severe cases of KS that are localized to the limbs amputation is
indicated.

Transplant-associated KS is seen in KSHV seropositive patients
receiving immunosuppressive agents. Thus the incidence rates
of transplant-associated KS track the seroprevalences of KSHV.
Transplant-associated KS is a signiﬁcant cause of morbidity and
mortality in Italy, Turkey, Saudia-Arabia, e.g., in developed coun-
tries with substantial KSHV seroprevalence (8–18%). KS seen in
solid organ transplant recipients is called iatrogenic KS (Har-
wood et al., 1979). The ﬁrst-line therapy is tapering of the
immune suppressive regimen. This often leads to lesions reso-
lution (or immune-mediated tumor regression), though it risks
organ rejection. Lately, rapamycin has emerged as an effective
therapy for transplant-associated KS (Stallone et al., 2005), either
as second-line substitutive immune suppressive regimen or as
addition to cyclosporine mediated immune maintenance regi-
mens. Transplant-associated KS tends to occur later (after the ﬁrst
year) than viremic herpesvirus-associated complications. Either
the donor organ or the recipient can be the source of KSHV in this
setting, as well as de novo exposure post transplantation when
immunosuppressive therapies are administered (Barozzi et al.,
2003).

AIDS–KS is found with greatly increased frequency in HIV-
positive men. It is an AIDS-deﬁning disease and was initially called
epidemic KS. Note that KS can become an epidemic disease only
in those HIV-positive populations that have high prevalence rates
of KSHV. In the US and other developing countries, these are men
who have sex with men, not individuals who acquired HIV through
blood transfusion prior to the introduction of mandatory HIV
screening of blood supplies (Gao et al., 1996a,b; Kedes et al., 1996).
In regions of endemic KS, where initial exposure happens during
childhood, these are all individuals – children, men, and women
(though even here KS is twice as frequent in men as in women). In
the context of substantial immune suppression, i.e., terminal AIDS,

Treatment of KSHV-associated cancers

KS can be highly aggressive, and spreads quickly to internal organs
(Gottlieb et al., 1981). The clinical presentation of AIDS–KS has
become more diverse with the advent of ART. First, approximately
30% of HIV-associated KS cases in the US now occur in the set-
ting of successfully ART-suppressed HIV viral load. These cases
tend to have a milder clinical presentation (Maurer et al., 2007;
Krown et al., 2008). Second, terminal AIDS–KS-associated with
ART failure remains the leading malignancy of HIV-positive men.
Third, KS is often still the ﬁrst indication of HIV infection, par-
ticularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Like transplant-associated KS the
lesions often regress after immune-restoration post initiation of
ART. Fourth, the opposite clinical scenario has also been seen:
HIV-infected individuals who newly start ART develop KS within
the ﬁrst months of therapy, a manifestation that deﬁnes immune
reconstitution inﬂammatory syndrome (IRIS; Connick et al., 2004;
Bower et al., 2005; Crane et al., 2005; Leidner and Aboulaﬁa, 2005).
How do we treat these different forms of KS? Is there a mole-
cular mechanism or signature that may be utilized as the basis of
rational therapy choice? And how do we measure KS responses to
compare different therapeutic modalities? As mentioned above KS
can be limited or can present as fulminant disease, with internal
organ involvement. Persons with severe KS may also develop pri-
mary effusion lymphoma (PEL) or suffer from concurrent KSHV-
associated multicentric Castleman disease (MCD; described in
detail in later sections; see below). There is a wide range in clin-
ical presentations. Cutaneous lesions tend to be most common
at the lower extremities, but can appear anywhere (Cheung et al.,
2005). Oral KS, concurrent with cutaneous KS or as a single lesion
absent cutaneous involvement, has been reported in the context
of HIV infection. Whereas cutaneous lesions are a cause of stigma
as much as physical pain, the more insidious presentation is that
of KS in internal organs (lung, liver) without overt extensive cuta-
neous involvement, as is seen, e.g., in some patient populations in
Brazil (deSouza, personal communication).

Cutaneous KS lesions are typically dark and can present as
patches, papules, plaques, or nodules. There is a suspicion that
these clinical forms are part of a disease progression. However, the
different forms can present simultaneously on a single individual.
No formal studies have explicitly linked these broad descriptors
to survival or to response to therapy. KS can affect all internal
organs including but not limited to the lungs, liver, lymph nodes,
and the gastrointestinal tract. KS presents with lymphedema quite
frequently. As with many carcinomas, lymph node involvement
signiﬁes poor prognosis in children. In adults, lymph node involve-
ment does not always portend the same poor prognosis as other
cancers (Myskowski et al., 1988). The current staging system of
AIDS-associated KS is based on the AIDS Clinical Trials Group
(ACTG) Oncology Committee (Krown et al., 1989, 1997). Akin to
the standard TNM staging for solid tumors (Sobin et al., 2009),
it incorporates extent of tumor, where T0 signiﬁes that the KS is
restricted to the skin and/or lymph nodes and/or minimal oral
disease (i.e., non-nodular KS conﬁned to the palate), and T1 sig-
niﬁes tumor-associated edema or ulceration, gastrointestinal KS,
extensive oral KS, or KS in other non-nodal internal organs. Other
criteria in this classiﬁcation include the severity of immunodeﬁ-
ciency (I0 or I1) as measured by CD4 count and various systemic
symptoms/illnesses (S0 or S1). Both poor immune response (I), as

well as the stage of the tumor (T), most accurately predicted sur-
vival of AIDS–KS in the pre-ART era (Krown et al., 1997). Both
tumor stage and systemic illness also predicts dismal prognosis in
the post-ART era (Nasti et al., 2003). Of note this classiﬁcation sys-
tem was developed for AIDS–KS prior to ART. Whether this classi-
ﬁcation is also applicable to endemic KS is currently under study.
Notably this classiﬁcation does not consider KSHV viral load, as
this classiﬁcation system predates the discovery of KSHV. It does
not consider molecular markers of the tumor, such as proliferative
index of the lesions or circulating biomarkers, such as IL-6.

Regardless of clinical acumen, lesional biopsy is required to
establish KS, as lesions can be mistaken for hemangiomas, der-
matoﬁbromas, hematomas, purpuras etc., and in developing coun-
tries, tuberculosis (skin and internal). Other diseases that may be
mistaken for KS due to similar presentations include bacillary
angiomatosis, lymphangioma, angiosarcoma, and hemangioen-
dothelioma to list just a few.

Histologic diagnosis of KS is required prior to cytotoxic ther-
apy. Most individuals with KS lesions will have detectable KSHV in
blood and KS viral load is prognostic for KS. However, the degree
of viremia is highly variable. A study of classic KS reported an
average of <100 copies/ml (Guttman-Yassky et al., 2007), whereas
AIDS–KS is almost always associated with >1000 copies/ml. Com-
pared to other herpesvirus infections (Epstein–Barr-Virus or
human Cytomegalovirus) in the setting of AIDS or transplant-
associated immune suppression, the level of viremia is low, reduc-
ing the sensitivity of KSHV viral load based assays. By contrast
speciﬁcity of KSHV viral load assays is high, as a high viral load is
almost always associated with overt or imminent KS.

Seropositivity for KSHV latent nuclear antigen (LANA), which
at present is the most speciﬁc assay, cannot be used to diagnose KS.
It establishes exposure to the risk factor KSHV, however exposure
precedes disease by a long time. A rise in serum antibody titers may
happen in some instances, but not others, particularly in heavily
immune deﬁcient individuals. Early studies estimated a median
latency of 7 years between exposure and disease for pre-ART
AIDS–KS (Gao et al., 1996a). For classic KS, the latency may be
even longer; for endemic KS in children the latency can be months.
The diagnosis of KS is based on histologic features of the H&E
stain. As of late, immunohistochemistry for the KSHV antigen,
LANA, has been added to the diagnostic repertoire. As another
alternative, KSHV detection by PCR for viral DNA or RNA may
be informative. The problem here is that sensitivity of the PCR
depends on the accuracy and location of the excisional biopsy; for
instance, to minimize bleeding the most aggressive lesion is typi-
cally not biopsied. A confounding factor for RNA-based diagnosis
has been the RNAse-rich environment of the lesions, which pre-
vented RNA analyses by traditional methods (e.g., Northern blot)
until the introduction of more sensitive methods such as quanti-
tative real-time PCR (Renne, Lagunoff, Dittmer, unpublished).

Lesions are composed of vascular spaces comprised of large
endothelial cells that protrude into the vessel lumen due to thin-
ning of the blood vessel wall. Spindle cell proliferation can be
sparse or signiﬁcant. These proliferating spindle cells are the KS
tumor cells and the target for anti-KS therapy. Sometimes the
lesions resemble a ﬁbrosarcoma. The presence of extravascular ery-
throcytes and narrow irregular, angulated slits is a classic hallmark

of KS. Inﬂammatory mononuclear cell inﬁltrates are seen con-
sistently and are generally comprised of inﬁltrating lymphocytes,
macrophages, and plasma cells. Exactly how they contribute to
lesion development (or if at all) is unclear.

TREATMENT
As there are many forms of KS, one must separately consider treat-
ment options for each form. Clinical trial data in KS, especially
phase III studies, are limited by declining numbers of patients
in developed countries in the post-ART era. Therefore, published
treatment recommendations are based on both older trial data,
limited (phase I/II) trials, and consensus opinion. Of note, this
review by no means offers speciﬁc recommendations. These fall
into the purview of the treating physician. Rather, we will focus
on those regimens for which a reasonable rational basis exists and
these regimens are often arrived at post facto. With rare excep-
tions, phase III efﬁcacy data are usually not available for the more
modern therapies.

Kaposi sarcoma, as an AIDS-presenting manifestation in ART
naïve patients, often responds to ART and the ensuing immune
reconstitution alone. However, typically no more than half of
patients achieve lesion resolution with successful ART (Nguyen
et al., 2008). At present there are no clinical or molecular para-
meters that distinguish between responders and non-responders.
A phase III clinical trial comparing ART alone, or with delayed
chemotherapy to ART, with immediate adjunctive chemotherapy
for limited AIDS–KS in resource-limited settings (REACT-KS) has
recently started enrolling. Whether some ART regimens are better
suited to treat AIDS–KS than others is also currently under investi-
gation. Some HIV protease inhibitors have direct anti-tumor activ-
ity (Monini et al., 2004), and some also exhibit anti-viral KSHV
activity (Gantt et al., 2011). Antiretroviral combinations with non-
protease-inhibitors can also induce KS regression (Bower et al.,
2006).

Systemic chemotherapy, e.g., Doxil™, can be required in AIDS–
KS if lesions do not regress with primary ART therapy, and can be
useful in other situations as well. KS as an indicator of ART fail-
ure requires second and/or third line therapy for HIV, again with
concurrent or delayed chemotherapy. Early systemic chemother-
apy may help to suppress IRIS-associated ﬂares (Leidner and
Aboulaﬁa, 2005). KS that develops in the presence of successful
ART also requires KS-targeted chemotherapy.

In addition to ART, radiotherapy or surgery can be used
to treat isolated lesions. Cytotoxic chemotherapy includes vin-
cristine, bleomycin, doxorubicin, and etoposide, as single agents
or in combination. In particular the liposomal formulations of
pegylated-doxorubicin (Doxil™) or daunorubicin have shown
clinical efﬁcacy and are often the ﬁrst-line agent used. Taxol is
considered as a second-line option. Its efﬁcacy is, within a small
margin, comparable to doxil. These chemotherapy options are part
of the standard repertoire of cytotoxic therapy for solid tumors,
including sarcomas, and were developed and clinically evaluated
in the pre-ART and pre-KSHV era. Many of these drugs have sig-
niﬁcant toxicities and a lifetime limit of exposure. While these
agents are efﬁcacious, they were not chosen because of unique
insights into the biology of the disease and they do not take into
account any novel targets that the tumor-associated virus may

present. Future improvements in KS treatment (i.e., higher efﬁ-
cacy and lower toxicity) will depend on better exploitation of these
disease-speciﬁc targets.

In patients afﬂicted with transplant-associated KS, complete
regression of cutaneous KS was seen when immunosuppressive
therapy was switched from cyclosporin to rapamycin (Campistol
et al., 2004; Stallone et al., 2005). These results have been recapitu-
lated in immune deﬁcient animal models of KS (Roy, Dittmer,
unpublished observation), and similar encouraging response
rates have been seen by others (Gutierrez-Dalmau et al., 2005;
Zmonarski et al., 2005; Lebbe et al., 2006). Of course, exceptions
have also been reported (Guenova et al., 2008). A recent study
showed rapamycin (sirolimus) to be well tolerated over a long
period of time (10 months) and to induce encouraging molecular
responses and disease stabilization in a limited study of AIDS–KS
(Krown et al., 2012).

Rapamycin is an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1. Rapamycin
binds to FK506-binding protein 12 (FKB12). The rapamycin–
FKB12 complex inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
kinase activity (Sabers et al., 1995). Rapamycin typically inhibits
cell proliferation with IC50s of 0.5–5 μM. Rapamycin is estab-
lished clinically since 1999 as a second-generation immunosup-
pressive agent for organ transplantation, because it inhibits IL-2
translation and secretion and thus T-cell proliferation. In this con-
text the cell autonomous G1 arrest phenotype is augmented by
inhibition of IL-2, which is a paracrine and autocrine growth fac-
tor for T cells. PEL are dependent on secreted autocrine growth
factors. This has been established for the B-cell survival factors
hIL-6 and hIL-10 (Komanduri et al., 1996; Asou et al., 1998; Aoki
and Tosato, 1999; Drexler et al., 1999; Foussat et al., 1999; Jones
et al., 1999; Chatterjee et al., 2002). IL-6, IL-10, IFNgamma, and
IL12p40 secretion is inhibited by rapamycin (Sin et al., 2007).
Other cytokines [IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-8,
IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, IP-10, Eotaxin, IFNγ, GM-CSF, MCP-1,
MIP-1α, RANTES, and TNFα] are not affected. VEGF-1 secretion
is also inhibited by rapamycin (Damania, Dittmer, unpublished).
Clinically, both direct and indirect mechanisms may contribute
to these responses. On one hand, tumor regression coincided with
the recovery of T-cell memory responses against KSHV latent
(Orf73) and lytic (K8.1) antigens (Barozzi et al., 2008). On the
other hand, rapamycin is directly toxic to KSHV-infected cells
(Sin et al., 2007), and KSHV-associated tumors, i.e., KS and PEL,
depend on the mTOR signaling pathway, which is directly tar-
geted by rapamycin (Sodhi et al., 2006; Wang and Damania, 2008).
KS lesions almost universally exhibit phosphorylated Akt, which
activates mTOR kinase and phosphorylated S6, which is a bio-
marker for mTOR kinase activity (Roy and Dittmer, 2011). This is
expected since the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated upon of VEGF–
VEGFR stimulation in endothelial cells and by the activation of
the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex in B cells.

Active Akt kinase promotes multiple cellular survival mecha-
nisms: (i) Akt enhances protein synthesis through increasing the
phosphorylation of mTOR (Gingras et al., 1998), (ii) Akt coun-
teracts apoptosis by directly phosphorylating and inactivating
pro-apoptotic factors such as BAD (Datta et al., 1997; Del Peso
et al., 1997; Cardone et al., 1998), (iii) Akt phosphorylates a family
of transcription factors known as the forkhead (FKHR) or FOXO

transcription factors; Brunet et al., 1999; Kops and Burgering,
1999; Tang et al., 1999). Members of this family include FKHR
(FOXO1a), FKHRL1 (FOXO3), and AFX (FOXO4). The net result
of phosphorylation of the downstream targets of Akt is cell survival
via inactivation of the FKHR family, GSK-3b, Caspase-9, and Bad
(Cross et al., 1995; Datta et al., 1997; Del Peso et al., 1997; Cardone
et al., 1998). Rapamycin blocks focus formation induced by onco-
genic alleles of the upstream mTOR regulators, PI3K, or Akt (Aoki
et al., 2001). Prolonged rapamycin treatment has been shown to
lead to increased Akt phosphorylation by the mTOR–Rictor com-
plex (Sarbassov et al., 2005, 2006), though this was not seen in
KS. Thus, the efﬁcacy of rapamycin (and more modern rapamycin
analogs) in KS may plausibly be the result of a slightly differ-
ent wiring of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in KSHV-associated
cancers.

PRIMARY EFFUSION LYMPHOMA
The discovery of KSHV in KS prompted a frantic search for other
cancers that may be associated with this new virus. Following the
paradigm of EBV, which is seen in nasopharyngeal carcinoma,
a solid organ cancer, as well as in lymphomas, KSHV sequences
were rapidly identiﬁed in an uncommon type of B-cell lymphoma
(Cesarman et al., 1995): PEL. KSHV infection is necessary for
PEL development. The ﬁrst cell lines for this lymphoma were
obtained from body cavity effusions of what was hitherto called
AIDS-associated lymphohematopoietic neoplasms. They carried
EBV as well as KSHV (Knowles et al., 1989; Cesarman et al., 1995).
PEL occurs with increased frequency in HIV-infected individu-
als; including those with concurrent KS. PEL account for 3% of
AIDS-related lymphomas. This may be a skewed estimate, since
it is may be quite common that AIDS patients die of other com-
plications, including KS, before a diagnosis of PEL can be made
(Nador et al., 1996; Gaidano et al., 1998). PEL is exceedingly rare
in HIV-negative individuals (Walts et al., 1990; Green et al., 1995).
The recognition that KSHV was always found in PEL, and EBV
in 50–80% of PEL, led to their classiﬁcation as a new sub-type of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Nador et al., 1996). PEL cell lines con-
tain many copies of the KSHV genome as nuclear plasmids, which
greatly facilitates molecular studies for this virus.

Primary effusion lymphoma can also occur in unusual sites
(Said et al., 1996; Moatamed et al., 2011) and solid variants have
been described as well. These variants also carry the KSHV genome
and express at least the KSHV latent genes (Nador et al., 1996;
Said et al., 1996; Engels et al., 2003; Chadburn et al., 2004; Car-
bone et al., 2005; Deloose et al., 2005). The diagnostic criteria for
PEL (Nador et al., 1996; Cesarman and Knowles, 1999; Raphaël
et al., 2008) include immunoblastic–anaplastic large-cell morphol-
ogy, null-cell phenotype with no B-cell-associated antigen and
immunoglobulin expression, and B-cell genotype as ascertained
by BCR rearrangement. High CD138/Syndecan-1 (Gaidano et al.,
1997) expression and hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes
(Matolcsy et al., 1998) established that PELs are post-germinal
center (GC) tumors at a pre-terminal stage prior to plasma-cell dif-
ferentiation (this does not exclude the possibility that PEL arrived
at this stage through extra-GC maturation). Transcript proﬁling
conﬁrmed this genesis (Palarcik, 1991; Jenner et al., 2003; Klein
et al., 2003; O’Hara et al., 2008, 2009).

Survival on conventional chemotherapy is very poor (Nador
et al., 1996; Simonelli et al., 2003), but of course PEL patients tend
to have multiple comorbidities at presentation. The effusions may
be managed by repeated drainage but eventually solid nests of PEL
abolish vital organ functions. In PEL the p53 and PTEN genes
are rarely mutated. P53 mutations accumulate after chemother-
apy (Petre et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2010). FHIT and WWOX, two
fragile site tumor suppressor genes, are deleted in many PEL cell
lines (Roy et al., 2011), however these and other genome-wide
association studies are limited by the scarcity of cases. Individual
case reports document responses to anti-viral therapy, bortezomib,
rapamycin (Sin et al., 2007), rituximab-containing chemother-
apy regimens (Oksenhendler et al., 1998; Boulanger et al., 2001;
Hocqueloux et al., 2001; Ghosh et al., 2003; Lim et al., 2005; Sid-
diqi and Joyce, 2008), or pleurodesis with bleomycin (Yiakoumis
et al., 2011). Bortezomib’s (Velcade™) primary mechanism of
action is inhibition of the 26S proteasome and nuclear factor B
(NFκB) activity. Rapamycin (Sirolimus™) inhibits mTOR signal-
ing, rituximab (Rituxan™) is a humanized monoclonal antibody
against CD20, and bleomycin induces DNA breaks and eventually
apoptosis in rapidly growing cells.

MULTICENTRIC CASTLEMAN DISEASE
One other disease entity has been convincingly associated with
KSHV. This is a sub-type of Castleman disease, speciﬁcally the
plasma-cell type (Keller et al., 1972). Castleman disease can be
localized to just one, or multiple lymph nodes can be involved.
The latter presentation is called MCD. MCD has mostly a plasma-
cell type morphology and is accompanied by systemic symptoms
(Waterston and Bower, 2004). These systemic symptoms may be a
result of cytokines, and in particular interleukin-6 (IL-6). The viral
homolog, vIL-6 is expressed in scattered plasmablasts surround-
ing the lymphoid follicles in MCD (Berti et al., 1997; Cannon
et al., 1999; Staskus et al., 1999). Thus, both KSHV-induced human
IL-6 and virus-encoded vIL-6 are found at high levels in MCD.
Recently, cases of an inﬂammatory syndrome with clinical symp-
toms similar to MCD have been described in AIDS patients with
KS, but no diagnosis of MCD (Uldrick et al., 2010). Here too, high
amounts of vIL-6 in the serum have been noted. This suggests
excess cytokine production is one of the systemic features of MCD
(Hasson, 1985).

Multicentric Castleman disease patients may also develop con-
current frank cancer, such as KS and NHL. KSHV is invariably
present in AIDS-associated MCD (Soulier et al., 1995; Larroche
et al., 2002) and the presence of KS and MCD in the same lymph
node is not rare. In some cases high angiosclerosis, GC, and per-
ifollicular vascular proliferation is seen, while plasmacytosis was
less pronounced (Suda et al., 2001). Studies are ongoing to better
understand this disease and to arrive at a more succinct clini-
cal description. The KSHV-positive cases may represent a distinct
morphologic variant from KSHV-negative MCD (Dupin et al.,
2000; Brousset et al., 2001). MCD lymph nodes can contain mul-
tiple KSHV-infected B cells, which may form microlymphomas
or even frank lymphomas. Here, KSHV-infected plasmablasts
are B-monotypic but polyclonal. They almost invariably express
IgM-lambda (Du et al., 2001). The infected B-lineage plasmablasts
in MCD differ from PEL. They lack somatic hypermutation and

expression of CD138. They express cytoplasmic Ig and may also
express CD27 (Du et al., 2001; Chadburn et al., 2008).

Median survival of MCD in HIV-positive individuals in the
pre-ART era was approximately 14 months (Oksenhendler et al.,
1996; Bower, 2010). Evidence of KSHV lytic viral protein expres-
sion led to testing of ganciclovir, with mixed results in small case
series (Corbellino et al., 2001; Casper et al., 2004). This is not
unexpected if for instance vIL-6 expression is independent, rather
than coincident with viral lytic gene expression (Chatterjee et al.,
2002). Under such a scenario the viral kinases orf36 and tk, which
are required for ganciclovir efﬁcacy would not be expressed. Alter-
natively, the drug regimen of just one anti-viral may be insufﬁcient
as a two-drug regimen combining valganciclovir and zidovudine
(AZT), showed promising results (Uldrick et al., 2011).

In MCD rational therapy has shown remarkable responses.
Treatment with tocilizumab, an anti-human interleukin-6 (IL-6)
receptor monoclonal antibody, resulted in clinical responses in
MCD patients that did not have AIDS (Nishimoto et al., 2005; Song
et al., 2010); and the anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, has shown
responses in up to 70% of patients (Corbellino et al., 2001; Gerard
et al., 2007; Bestawros et al., 2008; Bower, 2010; Bower et al., 2011).
The mechanism here is not clear. In MCD, the KSHV-positive B
cells frequently lack expression of CD20 (Chadburn et al., 2008;
Naresh et al., 2009), so the source of systemic symptoms may be
virus-negative plasma cells or other immune cells that respond to
infection.

CHALLENGES
Antiretroviral therapy has increased the life expectancy of the
HIV-infected population. However, as these individuals age,
there is likely to be a corresponding increase in the incidence
of cancers in the HIV-positive population. Most of the cur-
rent therapies do not target the unique viral etiology of can-
cers linked to KSHV infection. One exception are the anti-
herpes viral drugs which target lytic virus but do are not effec-
tive against latent virus. The interactions of chemotherapy with
HIV protease inhibitors is also another consideration that needs
to be addressed. In the future, it will be important to deter-
mine whether traditional chemotherapies are safe in the context
of currently prescribed HIV protease inhibitors, and to devise
newer therapies that directly target the viral etiology of these
cancers.
