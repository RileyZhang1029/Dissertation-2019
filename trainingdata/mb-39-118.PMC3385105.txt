The  ability  of  Ganoderma  to  produce  extracellular  enzymes,  including  β-glucosidase,  cellulase,  avicelase,  pectinase,  xylanase,
protease,  amylase,  and  ligninase  was  tested  in  chromogenic  media.  β-glucosidase  showed  the  highest  activity,  among  the  eight
tested  enzymes.  In  particular,  Ganoderma  neo-japonicum  showed  significantly  stronger  activity  for  β-glucosidase  than  that
of  the  other  enzymes.  Two  Ganoderma  lucidum  isolates  showed  moderate  activity  for  avicelase;  however,  Ganoderma  neo-
japonicum  showed  the  strongest  activity.  Moderate  ligninase  activity  was  only  observed  in  Ganoderma  neo-japonicum.  In  con-
trast,  pectinase,  amylase,  protease,  and  cellulase  were  not  present  in  Ganoderma.  The  results  show  that  the  degree  of  activity
of  the  tested  enzymes  varied  depending  on  the  Ganoderma  species  tested.

Numerous  studies  have  isolated  and  purified  high-quality
enzymes  from  fungi  [1].  Mushrooms,  like  all  other  fungi,
lack  chlorophyll  and  are  nongreen  organisms.  Thus,  they
cannot  covert  solar  energy  by  photosynthesis  to  organic
matter  as  in  green  plants,  but  they  do  produce  an  exten-
sive  array  of  enzymes  that  degrade  lignocellulosic  materi-
als for growth and fruiting [2]. The genus Ganoderma is a
fungi  famous  as  a  tonic  in  traditional  Asian  medicines
because  of  its  characteristics  and  biological  activities  and
is  also  a  very  important  genus  economically  [3].  Gano-
derma  species  grow  on  wood  and  are  classified  as  wood-
decaying  fungi.  Wood-decaying  fungi  degrade  cellulose,
hemicellulose, and lignin, the wood cell wall substrate, by
secreting cellulase, hemicellulase, and ligninase [4, 5].

Hong  et  al.  [6]  extracted  a  cellulase  from  Pleurotus
sajor-caju,  and  Hashimoto  [7]  isolated  a  carboxymethyl
cellulase from Pholiota nameko. Ro [8] and Min et al. [9]
produced  and  purified  a  protease  from  Fomes  fomentar-
ius  (Fr.)  Kicky  and  Pleurotus  cornucopiae,  respectively.
Additionally,  laccase  was  produced  from  Flammulina  veluti-
pes by Lee and Suh [10]. These results suggest that Gano-
derma may have a variety of extracellular enzymes such as
cellulases,  ligninases,  and  proteases.  However,  little  infor-
mation  on  the  activity  of  extracellular  enzymes  in  Gano-
derma has been reported. Therefore, we chose Ganoderma
neo-japonicum and Ganoderma lucidum to  test for enzyme
activity.  We  used  a  method  based  on  a  dye  coupled  to  a

polysaccharide  to  detect  the  extracellular  enzymes  secreted
from the fungi [11, 12].

Three Ganoderma species were prepared from the Korean
Agricultural  Culture  Collection  (Suwon,  Korea)  and  from
our  laboratory.  All  cultures  were  precultured  on  potato
dextrose  agar  (Difco,  Franklin  Lakes,  NJ,  USA)  at  25oC
for  5  days,  and  the  precultures  were  transferred  to  chro-
mogenic  media  [13].  A  0.1%  yeast  nitrogen  base  (Difco)
as  a  nitrogen  source  and  1.5%  agar  powder  were  used  as
the  basic  media  substrate.  Congo  Red  (0.5%;  Sigma,  St.
Louis,  MO,  USA)  was  used  as  the  chromogenic  dye,
media pH was adjusted to 7.0, and the incubation temper-
ature  was  controlled  at  25oC.  One  of  the  following  sub-
strates was included as a carbon source in the basic media:
0.5% CM-cellulose (Sigma) for CM-cellulase, Avicel (Fluka,
Arklow,  Ireland)  for  avicelase,  D-cellobiose  (Sigma)  for
β-glucosidase,  xylan  from  brichwood  (Sigma)  for  xyla-
nase, polygalacturonic acid (MP Biomedical, Vannes, France)
for  pectinase,  lignin  (Sigma)  for  ligninase,  starch  from
potato  (Duchefa,  Haarlem,  The  Netherlands)  for  amylase,
and  skim  milk  (Fluka)  for  protease.  To  correctly  identify
extracellular enzyme activity, the cellulolytic fungi Tricho-
derma  was  used  as  a  positive  control,  and  Saccharomy-
ces was used as a negative control.

After  a  5  day  incubation  at  25oC,  the  activity  of  each
enzyme was estimated by observing the clear zone formed
around the fungal colony resulting from the reaction between

the  enzymes  secreted  by  the  fungi  and  the  chromogenic
substrates.  The  clear  zone  was  measured  from  the  end  of
the fungal colony to the end of the color change zone and
was  divided  into  the  following  four  groups:  no  activity
group (N, 0~0.1 cm), weak activity  group  (W, 0.1~0.5 cm),
moderate  activity  group  (M,  0.5~1.0 cm),  and  a  strong
activity  group  (S,  1.0~1.5 cm).  These  tests  were  repeated
three times.

The results  of the extracellular  enzyme activity testing for
G.  neo-japonicum  and  G.  lucidum  are  shown  in  Table  1.
Among  the  eight  tested  enzymes,  β-glucosidase  had  more
activity  than  that  of  the  other  enzymes.  In  particular,  G.
neo-japonicum  showed  significantly  strong  activity.  Fig.  1
shows  several  examples  of  β-glucosidase  detection  on
chromogenic  media.  Only  G.  neo-japonicum  showed  activ-
ity  in  the  lignase  assay  (Fig.  2).  Strong  activity  for  avice-

lase  was  only  observed  in  G.  neo-japonicum,  whereas  the
other  species  showed  moderate  activity  (Fig.  3).  In  con-
trast,  pectinase,  amylase,  and  cellulose  tended  to  show
weak  activity.  G.  neo-japonicum  had  moderate  xylanase
activity, and G. lucidum ASI 7039 showed moderate cellu-
lase activity.

When  we  compared  the  Ganoderma  species  for  β-glu-
cosidase and avicelase activity, only G. neo-japonicum had
strong  β-glucosidase  activity  and  a  strong  ability  to  pro-
duce  avicelase.  However,  the  Ganoderma  species  showed
moderate  activity.  In  conclusion,  we  tested  G.  neo-japoni-
cum  and  two  G.  lucidum  isolates  for  eight  extracellular
enzyme activities using chromogenic media. There appeared
to  be  differences  in  the  production  of  these  enzymes
among  the  tested Ganoderma  species.  In most cases, they
showed  high  activity  for  enzymes  related  to  degrading
cellulose such as β-glucosidase and avicelase. Studies of the
biological,  chemical,  pharmacological,  and  clinical  appli-
cations of Ganoderma have been extensively reported, but
there is limited information on industrial applications such
as  the  use  of  extracellular  enzyme  activity.  Thus,  these
data  will  be  useful  to  apply  high-quality  enzymes  derived
from  an  edible  mushroom  such  as  G.  neo-japonicum  to
industries, including food processing, brewery, biofuels, and
bioremediation.
