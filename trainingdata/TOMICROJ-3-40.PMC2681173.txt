Abstract: Previous studies have identified a correlation, either positive or negative, between specific stool bacteria strains 
and  certain  autoimmune  diseases.  These  conflicting  data  may  relate  to  sample  collection.  The  aim  of  this  work  was  
to  evaluate  the  influence  of  the  collection  parameters  of  time  and  temperature  on  bacterial  community  composition.  
Samples were taken from healthy children and immediately divided in 5 sub-samples. One sample was frozen immediately  
at  -80°C,  while  the  other  aliquots  were  frozen  12,  24,  48,  and  72h  later  DNA  extracted  from  each  sample  was  used  to  
amplify the 16S rRNA with barcoded primers. The amplified products were pooled and partial 16S rRNA sequences were 
obtained  by  pyrosequencing.  Person-to-person  variability  in  community  diversity  was  high.  A  list  of  those  taxa  that  
comprise at least 1% of the community was made for each individual. None of these were present in high numbers in all 
individuals. The Bacteroides were present in the highest abundance in three of four subjects. A total of 23,701 16S rRNA 
sequences  were  obtained  with  an  average  of  1,185  reads  per  sample  with  an  average  length  of  200  bases.  Although  
pyrosequencing of  amplified 16S rRNA identified changes in  community composition over  time  (~10%), little diversity 
change  was  observed  at  12  hours  (3.06%)  with  gradual  changes  occurring  after  24  (8.61%),  48  (9.72%),  and  72  h 
(10.14%), post collection. 

INTRODUCTION 

  Associations  between  gut  microbiota  and  either  the  risk 
for or presence of specific human diseases have been shown 
in  recent  years.  Several  allergenic  and  autoimmune  diseases 
including Crohn's disease [1, 2],  celiac disease [3], and  type 
1  diabetes  [4]  have  shown  correlations  with  an  altered  gut 
microflora  in  humans  and  animal  models  of  these  disorders. 
Bacteria  inhabiting  the  gastrointestinal  tract  may  affect  mu-
cosal  permeability  and/or  lead  to  abnormal  immunoregula-
tion  as  has  been  reported  in  multiple  sclerosis,  allergy  and 
inflammatory bowel disease [5].  The  influence of gut bacte-
ria  on  human  disease  is  not  limited  to  immunologically  me-
diated  disorders  as  altered  gut  microbiota  have  also  been 
related to a propensity for obesity [6].  

  The  microbial  composition  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract 
has  been  studied  by  a  variety  of  molecular  or  culture  based 
techniques using either fecal samples or samples obtained by 
biopsy. Biopsies  are  invasive. On the other hand, fecal sam-
ples  are  easier  to  obtain  and  contain  intestinal  bacteria  and 
exfoliated  epithelial  cells  that  may  provide  useful  informa-
tion  concerning  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  However,  the 
analysis  of  the  microbiota  in  fecal  samples  requires  that  the

sampling procedure does not alter the microbial composition 
of the samples.  

 
In  order  to  evaluate  whether  microbial  communities 
maintain  the  same  structure  after  storage  at  room  tempera-
ture,  stool  samples  from  healthy  individuals  were  collected 
with aliquots stored at room temperature  at various times up 
to 72 hours. By using 16S rRNA PCR amplification and py-
rosequencing, changes  in community composition were  ana-
lyzed.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Sample  Collection,  Experimental  Design,  and  DNA  
Extraction 

 
Fresh  fecal  samples  were  obtained  from  four  healthy 
children  at  the  University  of  Turku  Hospital  (Turku,  Fin-
land).  Samples  were  collected  in  sterile  flask  containers  and 
immediately divided in 5 sub-samples. One sample was fro-
zen immediately at -80°C and the other aliquots were kept at 
room  temperature  and  frozen  after  12,  24,  48,  and  72h.  The 
samples were then sent on frozen ice packs to the University 
of  Florida  for  further  analyses.  Bacterial  DNA  was  isolated 
from  the  stool  samples  using  the  FastDNA®  Kit  (Qbiogene, 
Inc., CA). Following DNA extraction, samples were purified 
with  DNeasy  Tissue  kits  (Qiagen,  Valencia,  CA)  utilizing 
the manufacturer’s instructions.

16S rRNA Gene Amplification and 454 Pyrosequencing 

Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) 

  The V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified from 
the  stool  DNA.  To  obtain  16S  rRNA  sequences  from  many 
samples  with  a  single  454  pyrosequencing  run,  an  8-base 
barcode was added to the 5’-end of the reverse primers using 
the  self-correcting  barcoding  method  of  Hamady  et  al.  [7]. 
The  barcoded  16S  rRNA  primers  were  attached  to  the  454 
Life  Sciences®  primer  B  and  A,  and  a  two-base  linker  se-
quence  was  inserted  between  the  454  adapter  and  the  16S 
rRNA  primers  to  reduce  any  effect  the  composite  primer 
might have on PCR efficiency (see supplementary material). 
Six  independent  PCR  reactions  were  performed  for  each 
sample.  The  PCR  conditions  were  94°C  for  2  minutes,  25 
cycles  of  94°C  for  45s;  55°C  for  45s;  and  72°C  for  1  min 
extension;  followed  by  72°C  for  6  minutes.  The  six  PCR 
replications  for  each  of  the  20  samples  were  combined  and 
purified  with  the  QIAquick  PCR  Purification  Kit  (Qiagen, 
Valencia, CA). The DNA concentration of the PCR products 
was measured using on-chip gel electrophoresis with an Ag-
ilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and DNA LabChip® Kit 7500. Finally 
the  reactions  were  combined  in  equimolar  ratios  to  create  a 
DNA pool that was used for pyrosequencing from adaptor A. 

Data Preparation Prior to Further Analysis 

 
Initially,  all  pyrosequencing  reads  were  screened  for 
quality  and  length  of  the  sequences.  The  ends  of  the  se-
quences  with  Phred  scores  lower  than  20  were  trimmed  and 
reads  shorter  than  100  bases  were  removed  from  the  dataset 
using Trim2 [8]. The trimmed sequences were than screened 
beginning with the 8-base barcode. A custom perl script was 
written  to  find  the  barcode  and  generate  a  new  file  for  each 
sample.  The  sequences  were  then  relabeled  accordingly  to 
denote the original sample.  

 
For each of the 20 libraries, the sequences were grouped 
into  Operational  Taxonomy  Units  (OTUs)  using  the  same 
pipeline applied by Roesch et al. [9] and by defining an OTU 
as those sequences with a similarity equal to, or greater than, 
97%. The longest sequence in a cluster was chosen as a rep-
resentative  sequence  for  each  cluster  and  a  new  non-
redundant  library  was  created  for  each  sample.  The  number 
of  OTUs  in  each  library  was  determined  in  each  sample  for 
further analysis.  

UniFrac Significance Test and Phylogenetic P-Test 

  UniFrac  calculations  were  performed  separately  on  the 
samples from  each individual (subjects A,  B,  C and D). The 
analysis  was  done  in  a  pairwise  hierarchical  scheme  that 
compared  each  of  the  time  points  from  12-72  h  against  the 
immediately frozen sample as a reference. For each pairwise 
comparison,  MUSCLE  [10]  was  used  to  build  a  guide  tree 
using  the  UPGMA  agglomerative  clustering  method.  The 
resulting  phylogenetic  tree  from  MUSCLE,  a  text  file  con-
taining  the  number  of  sequences  found  within  each  out,  and 
the  subject  from  which  the  samples  were  derived  were  up-
loaded  into  the  online  UniFrac  program  [11].  The  weighted 
and  unweighted  UniFrac  significance  tests  and  a  phyloge-
netic  P-test  were  performed.  The  P-values  reported  for  mul-
tiple  comparisons  and  were  corrected  by  Bonferroni  correc-
tion,  which  is  performed  by  multiplying  the  raw  P-value  by 
the number of permutations. 

  To  examine  variation  in  the  genetic  structure  of  the  bac-
terial population during time of storage at room temperature, 
AMOVA analysis was performed using the same dataset that 
was  imported  into  UniFrac.  A  list  of  aligned  representative 
sequences  and  their  frequencies  within  each  sample  were 
placed in  a text file that was used  to perform  the analysis of 
molecular  variance.  The  AMOVA  procedure  incorporates 
the  estimated  divergence  between  sequences  and  their 
frequencies. All  calculations were performed using Arlequin 
ver. 3.0 [12]. With AMOVA, the variance between commu-
nities  and  the  percentage  of  total  variance  between  commu-
nities was determined. 

Fraction of OTUs Shared 

  The  proportion  of  OTUs  shared  among  the  communities 
was determined using SONS [13], which uses the .list output 
files  from  DOTUR  as  input  and  determines  the  fraction  of 
OTUs  shared  by  communities  as  a  function  of  genetic  dis-
tance. For this analysis, all sequences were pooled from each 
subject  in the same file  and aligned using  MUSCLE [10].  A 
distance  matrix  was  then  generated  using  the  PHYLIP  ver-
sion  3.6  [14].  With  the  distance  matrix,  DOTUR  [15]  was 
used  and  the  output  files  from  DOTUR  were  used  to  run 
SONS. A  list of  shared OTUs  comprising the number of se-
quences from each OTU at different time of storage was then 
generated.  To  identify  changes  in  specific  bacterial  lineages 
and obtain a quantitative description of the bacterial lineages, 
only those OTUs  that were 1% or more abundant  were used 
in  the  dataset.  For  each  OTU  (defined  as  97%  similarity  or 
greater)  an  exact  Chi-square  test  (based  on  50000  Monte 
Carlo  iterations)  was  calculated  to  obtain  a  p-value  for  the 
null  hypothesis.  That  is,  H0:  equal  success  probabilities, 
which  means  that  there  are  no  differences  in  that  specific 
OTU after sample storage at room temperature. The p-values 
were  ordered  and  processed  to  find  a  false  discover  rate 
(FDR) less than 1%. 

Phylogenetic Classification 

  The  16S  rRNA  gene  sequences  were  phylogenetically 
assigned according  to their best matches  to sequences  in the 
NAST  (Nearest  Alignment  Space  Termination)  database 
[16].  The  sequences  were  submitted  to  a  web-interface  tool 
(http://greengenes.lbl.gov/NAST)  and  aligned  against  the 
greengenes  16S  rRNA  reference  database  (188,073  aligned 
16S rRNA records). Once aligned, the sequences were  taxo-
nomically  classified  according  to  the  best  match  with  the 
reference database using the NCBI taxonomic nomenclature. 

Nucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers 

  The sequences from 16S gene libraries were submitted to 
Gen  Bank  and  received  the  following  GenBank  accession 
numbers: FJ719841-FJ743434. 

RESULTS 

  The  pyrosequences  averaged  200  bases  in  length.  The 
number  of  sequences  and  the  number  of  OTUs  found  (97% 
similarity)  for  each  sample  was  determined  (Table 1).  After 
removing  short  reads,  trimming  low  quality  ends,  and  re-
moving  chimeric  sequences,  a  total  of  23,701  reads  were 
available  for  the  analyses.  The  average  number  of  reads  for

each  sample  was  1,185  and  the  number  of  OTUs  found  
varied  form  a  maximum  of  198  (subject  A  at  12h)  to  a  
minimum of 14 (subject D 1h).

Overall Bacterial Community Comparisons 

  The  UniFrac  p-values  were  determined  for  both  pres-
ence/absence  and  abundance  of  bacterial  lineages  (Table 2). 
The  UniFrac  significance  test  accounts  for  both  the  tree  

Roesch et al. 

topology and the branch lengths, and tests the hypothesis that 
there  has  been  more  unique  evolution  within  each  environ-
ment  than  would  be  expected  if  the  sequences  were  ran-
domly  distributed  among  the  environments  [11].  If  the  p-
values  are  greater  than  or  equal  to  0.1,  the  communities  are 
not considered statistically significantly different. From sub-
jects  A,  C  and  D,  the  p-values  were  greater  than  0.1  at  all 
time  periods  in  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  analysis. 
Thus,  no  changes  in  bacterial  community  were  observed 
even  after  72h.  In  subject  B,  no  qualitative  changes  were 
observed  after  72h.  However,  a  significant  quantitative  dif-
ference  was  observed  when  comparing  the  IM  to  48h  time 
points.  

  UniFrac  compares  communities  for  significant  differ-
ences  and  typically  does  not  detect  shifts  in  bacterial  com-
munities  when  there  are  many  sequences  that  are  closely 
related  to  each  other  but  that  are  unique  to  one  particular 
sample.  Thus,  the  phylogenetic  P-test  is  more  likely  to  give 
significant results when fewer OTUs are required  to  explain 
the  actual  distribution  of  sequences  in  environments  than 
would  be  required  if  sequences  were  randomly  assigned  
to  samples  [11].  The  p-values  calculated  for  each  pair  of 
samples  were  determined  using  the  Phylogenetics  P-test 
(Table 3). No significant changes were observed in bacterial 
community  compositions  in  any  of  the  subjects  after  12h  of 
sample  storage  (Table  3).  A  significant  difference  between 
the  original  bacterial  community  and  the  community  ob-
served after 24h in subject B was observed (p-value = 0.01). 
However  no  significant  differences  were  found  in  the  other 
subjects at 24h. Most significant differences were found after 
48h. The subject  B  samples changed significantly beginning 
at  24h  while  subject  D’s  samples  showed  no  changes  over 
the 72h period.  The samples from subjects A and  C showed 
significant changes at 48h.  

Genetic Differentiation of Bacterial Communities 

  Changes  in  bacterial  communities  were  also  analyzed  at 
the level of community genetic structure inferred by analysis 
of variance. The Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) 
computes  differences  between  microbial  communities  based 
on  phylogenetic  information.  However,  unlike  UniFrac, 
which  calculate  the  population  differentiation  based  on  tree

The comparison was made considering the presence/absence (qualitative) and the abundance (quantitative) of taxonomic unities. All P-values have been corrected for multiple com-
parisons  by  multiplying  the  calculated  P-value  by  the number of  comparisons  made  (Bonferroni  correction).  For each pairwise  comparison,  if  the  p-value  is  less  than or  equal  to 
0.001 the result indicates a highly significant difference in the composition of the communities sampled by each library. P-values from 0.001 to 0.01 indicate a significant difference, 
from  0.01  to 0.05  indicate  a  marginally  significant difference,  from  0.05  to  0.1  indicate  a  suggestive  difference  and  if  the p-values  are  greater  than  0.1  the  result  indicate  that  the 
difference is not significant.

P-values have been corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction. (Each p-value was multiplied by the number of pairwise comparisons performed). For each 
pairwise comparison, if the p-value is less than or equal to 0.001 the result indicates a highly significant difference in the composition of the communities sampled by each library. P-
values from 0.001 to 0.01 indicate a significant difference, from 0.01 to 0.05 indicate a marginally significant difference, from 0.05 to 0.1 indicate a suggestive difference and if the

topology  and  branch  lengths,  AMOVA  makes  use  of  the 
molecular  information  obtained  in  the  DNA  sequences  to 
investigate  the  genetic  differentiation  of  the  sampled  com-
munities.  In  addition  to  determining  whether  a  change  has 
occurred  in  bacterial  community  composition,  AMOVA  de-
scribes  the  extent  to  which  the  entire  community  has 
changed.  

  After 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, the average bacterial commu-
nity  across  all  subjects  changed  by  3.06,  8.61,  9.72,  and 
10.14%,  respectively  (Fig.  1,  Table  4).  All  of  these  changes 
were statistically significant. Most of the change in commu-
nity structure occurred between 12 and 24 h after collection.

Identification  of  the  Bacterial  Taxa  whose  Abundances 
Change Over Time 

 
In order to identify which bacterial lineages contribute to 
differences observed after storage 16S rRNA sequences were 
compared  and  clustered  based  on  97%  similarity  level  and 
above.  For  each  comparison,  an  exact  Chi-square  test  was 
performed  to  obtain  p-values  which  were  used  to  determine 
whether the relative abundance of specific groups of bacteria 
changed  over  time.  Finally,  representative  sequences  for 

each OTU were classified and closest bacterial relative iden-
tified.  Taxonomic  units  were  classified  to  the  highest  speci-
ficity  level,  ranging  from  phylum  to  genus.  A  heat  map 
showing  the  proportion  of  bacteria  found  at  different  times 
of storage and the significance of the variation was prepared 
(Fig. 2). To avoid errors in analysis based on undersampling 
of  certain  taxa,  only  those  taxa  that  represented  at  least  1% 
of  the  total  number  of  sequences  in  any  subject  at  any  time 
point were considered.

Fig (2). Heat map showing the proportion of bacteria found at different times of storage (immediately (IM), after 12h, 24h, 48h and 72h) and 
the significance of the variation observed. Maps A, B, C and D represent the subjects analyzed. The scale on the right represents the contri-
bution of a particular OTU and it  is  expressed in percentage of  the total. The closest bacterial relative is shown in the  left  side of the map. 
Note that OTUs were classified to the highest specificity level, ranging from phylum to genus. 

  Those taxa that represent more than 1% of the total popu-
lation  were  identified  to  the  genus  level  wherever  possible 
(Fig.  2).  In  some  cases,  taxa  could  only  be  identified  at  the 
family or order level. The proportion of identifiable bacteria 
that  also  represent  more  that  1%  of  the  population  varied 
among  subjects  and  across  time  with  as  few  as  63.2%  in 
Subject A at 48h or 94.2% in Subject D at 24 h.  

  Although  most  of  the  454  sequences  could  be  identified 
at the genus level, most could not be classified at the species 
level.  However,  genus-level  identification  allows  us  to  esti-
mate the general physiological characteristics of these organ-
isms.  No  genus  was  represented  by  more  than  1%  of  se-
quences in all four subjects. This is largely owing to the lack 
of  diversity  in  the  subject  D  samples.  Only  five  taxa  repre-
senting  over  90%  of  the  bacterial  communities  across  all 
time points could be identified in the subject D samples.  

 
Some  taxa  clearly  change  across  time  in  more  than  one 
subject. For example, Rumminococcus strains decline in sub-
jects  B  and  C  over  time.  Alistipes  and  Faecalibacterium 
strains  decline  over  time  in  subjects  A  and  B.  The  bacterial 
changes in these samples across time are not always consis-
tent between samples. For example, in subject A, the Dialis-
ter  and  Streptococcus  organisms  increased  in  relative  abun-
dance  over  time,  while  in  sample  B,  the  abundance  of  these 
organisms dropped rapidly over time.  

  Differences between subjects were greater than the varia-
tion  in  the  fecal  sample  variation  caused  by  storage  within 
the  same  subject.  Irrespective  of  the  subject  analyzed,  most 
of the organisms were members of Firmicutes and Bacteroi-
detes phyla. Most Firmicutes were  members of  Clostridium. 
The  variability  in  the  relative  abundance  of  bacteria  found 
within individuals increased or decreased over time depend-

identified, Bacteroides and Clostridium, decreased over time 
while certain species from the Enterobacteriaceae increased. 

changes  are  observed  over  72hr  if  the  whole  community  is 
considered.  However,  careful  examination  of  the  dominant 
taxa shows that changes are occurring.  

DISCUSSION 

 
In  recent  years,  there  has  been  increasing  interest  in  
the  discovery  of  correlations  between  bacterial  communities 
in  the  human  gut  and  disease  [2,  6,  17-23].  Several  studies 
have  shown  a  correlation  between  gut  bacteria  communities 
and  the  development  of  autoimmune  diseases.  In  Crohn’s 
disease,  a  T-RFLP  fingerprinting  method  was  used  to  
shown that bacterial diversity is higher in stool from healthy 
subjects  compared  to  their  twin  diseased  subjects.  Two  
rodent  models  for  type  1  diabetes  have  shown  that  feeding 
antibiotic  or  probiotics  can  delay  the  onset  of  the  disease  
[1,  24-27].  In  addition,  a  germ-free  environment  increases 
the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice [28, 29].  

  These  recent  results  encourage  the  use  of  human  stool 
samples to search for bacteria  that are  correlated, negatively 
or  positively,  with  the  onset  of  type  1  diabetes  in  children. 
Two studies have  collected such samples that could be used 
for  this  purpose.  The  Diabetes  Prediction  and  Prevention 
study (DIPP)  in Finland has been  collecting stool  and blood 
samples quarterly (beginning soon  after birth) from  children 
at  high  risk  for  the  disease  since  1994.  A  larger  prospective 
study  in  the  United  States,  Germany,  Sweden,  and  Finland 
called  The  Environmental  Determinants  of  Diabetes  in  the 
Young  (TEDDY)  (seeking  to  determine  possible  environ-
mental  triggers of autoimminty) has been collecting samples 
since 2004 from genetically high risk children on  a monthly 
basis  [30].  In  both  studies,  some  have  seroconverted  and 
developed type 1 diabetes.  

  The  stool  samples  from  the  DIPP  and  TEDDY  studies 
could be very useful in determining whether any bacteria are 
correlated  with  both  the  triggering  of  the  autoimmune  proc-
ess  and/or  the  onset  of  type  1  diabetes.  However,  to  be  use-
ful,  the  conditions  under  which  they  were  collected  need  to 
be  examined  to  be  certain  that  collection  protocols  to  not 
impact the bacterial contents of these samples.  

 
Four  samples  were  taken  from  healthy  children  enrolled 
in  the  DIPP  study.  Each  sample  was  divided  into  five  ali-
quots. One was immediately frozen at -80°C while the others 
were frozen after 12, 24, 48,  and 72h. The 72h period is the 
maximum  time  required  to  collect  a  sample  from  the  infant 
or  child  until  it  is  frozen  at  a  DIPP  or  TEDDY  repository. 
During that period of transit, the sample sits at or near room 
temperature.  In  order  for  DIPP  or  TEDDY  samples  to  be 
useful, it is important to know whether the bacterial commu-
nity composition changes over the 72-hour period.  

  Over  a  72-hours,  we  showed  that  bacterial  communities 
only  change  by  ~10%  with  most  change  beginning  between 
12 and 24 hours. As expected, there was  enormous variabil-
ity from person to person in both bacterial  community  com-
position and  in  the rate of  change in composition over  time. 
This suggests that nutrient availability in stool is very differ-
ent from sample to sample, thereby affecting growth rates at 
room temperature over time.  

 
In addition,  changes are observed only in the most abun-
dant  taxa.  The  samples  are  so  diverse  that  no  statistical 

  These data  suggest that new  experiments may be needed 
to  examine  these  issues  further.  For  example,  what  is  the 
effect of storage temperature over time?  That  is, could  a de-
livery  time  of  2-3  days  from  the  time  of  collection  to  the 
time  of  permanent  storage  be  tolerated  if  the  samples  were 
immediately placed on ice packs? Is storage at 4°C or -20°C 
during  transit  cold  enough  to  minimize  changes  in  commu-
nity composition?  

 
Finally  and  most  importantly,  are  the  changes  observed 
here over time, large enough to mask changes that may occur 
over  time  in  one  person  during  the  several  month  period  of 
seroconversion?  TEDDY  metadata  shows  that  23.9%  of  all 
samples  collected  in  the  Georgia,  Florida,  Colorado,  and 
Washington State clinics are frozen within 24h of collection. 
Thus, if AMOVA shows that the changes that occur in bacte-
rial community composition during seroconversion are much 
greater  than  10%,  the  current  DIPP  and  TEDDY  samples 
may be very useful, particularly the large number of samples 
frozen within 24h.
