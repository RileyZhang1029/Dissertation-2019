Abstract
Recent months have seen rapid advances in the field of transdifferentiation, specifically in the conversion
of fibroblasts to neurons. Most surprising is the observation that the ability to drive these transitions is not
limited to transcription factors, but that they can be promoted by microRNAs as well. Indeed, in one case,
microRNAs alone induced the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to neuron-like cells, albeit at a low
efficiency. Here, we review this rapidly advancing field, discuss possible mechanisms underlying microRNA-
induced transdifferentiation and the potential for microRNAs to drive such transitions to any cell type of
interest in vitro and in vivo.

Introduction
The holy grail of regenerative medicine is to replace the
damaged or lost cells that occur as we age, suffer disease, or
are exposed to environmental insults. In theory regenera-
tion could be achieved using the processes of dediffer-
entiation (reprogramming of a differentiated cell to revert
to a stem cell), or transdifferentiation (reprogramming
one type of differentiated cell to become another sort of
differentiated cell). Recent advances have shown that these
phenomena can be induced in adult mammalian cells by
modulating the expression of particular genes.

In 1987, Weintraub and colleagues made the pioneering
discovery that the addition of a single transcription factor
could convert a fibroblast to a muscle cell [1]. In recent
years, the number of examples of transcription factor-
induced transdifferentiation is growing at a remarkable
rate. In 2004, Graf and colleagues induced mouse
B-lymphocytes into macrophages [2]. In 2008, Melton
and colleagues described the transdifferentiation of mouse
pancreatic acinar cells to beta-islet cells [3]. Two years later,
Wernig and colleagues induced the conversion of mouse
fibroblasts to neurons, showing for the first time that
addition of transcription factors can induce transdiffer-
entiation across germ layers – from cell types formed in the
mesoderm to those formed in the ectoderm [4]. These

efforts were originally performed using mouse cells.
A recent litany of papers has taken it a step further directing
the conversion of human fibroblasts to neurons as well as
the differentiation to specific neuronal subtypes [5-11].

MicroRNAs can change cell fate
While most transdifferentiation experiments have used
cocktails of transcription factors ranging from three to as
many as eleven, two recent studies have included micro-
RNAs. microRNAs are short non-coding RNAs approxi-
mately twenty-one nucleotides in length that bind to
complementary pieces of mRNA after transcription and
inhibit their translation. Like transcription factors, they can
regulate hundreds of targets simultaneously. Also like
transcription factors, they recognize short motifs (7-8
nucleotides) in their targets [12]. For microRNAs, these
motifs are predominantly in the 3’UTRs (untranslated
regions) and occasionally the coding region of mRNAs. In
contrast, transcription factors bind DNA motifs within
promoter and enhancer regions of the genome’s DNA.

Transcription factors have been accepted as potential master
regulators of cell fate ever since Weintraub’s seminal work.
In contrast, microRNAs have rarely been thought of as such.
Indeed, they are more typically described as stabilizers of
cell fates or buffers of stochastic transcriptional noise and

external stressors [13]. This view has been clearly challenged
by recent results showing that microRNAs can induce
transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to neurons as well as work
showing that they can induce the dedifferentiation of
fibroblasts to embryonic-like stem cells. In retrospect, hints
of this remarkable capacity of microRNAs to drive fates by
globally modulating the transcriptome date back to
experiments performed by Lim and colleagues [14]. They
showed that the introduction of a single microRNA, miR-
124, could induce HeLa cells, a cell line derived from a
cervical cancer, to partially transition toward a neuronal
state as defined by the transcriptional program. However,
the treated cells were not shown to have morphological or
functional properties of neurons.

Like Lim and colleagues, two recent studies used miR-
124 to promote the transition of human fibroblasts to
neurons. In particular, Ding and colleagues [5] com-
bined miR-124 with two transcription factors first used
by Vierbuchen and colleagues [4], MYT1L and BRN2. In
contrast, Crabtree and colleagues showed that miR-124
and miR-9 alone could induce the conversion, albeit at a
low efficiency, and functional characterization of the
resulting cells was lacking [7]. The addition of
the
transcription factor NeuroD1 along with miR-124 and
miR-9 greatly increased the efficiencies and the resulting
cells were shown to have functional properties of
neurons. On the surface, the fact that microRNAs alone
are able to drive this conversion is puzzling as it requires
the microRNAs to somehow activate a new program by
suppressing its mRNA targets. How does suppression of
targets lead to activation of a new cellular program? One
possibility is that the downregulation of non-neural
transcripts by the neural-enriched microRNAs creates a
permissive atmosphere for stochastic or leaky gene
expression to lead to preferential activation of neuronal
gene expression programs. These non-neural transcripts
would be likely to include mRNAs important
for
fibroblast identity as well as alternative non-neuronal
cell fates. Alternatively, the microRNAs could be situated
in a signaling network that directly activates neuron-
specific components. That is, the cell fates are driven by
double negatives, where the microRNA suppresses a
repressor leading to activation of the neuronal cell fate.
The answer is likely some combination of the two.

Some hints as to how microRNAs may be inducing cell
fate transitions that do not normally occur during
development comes from recent work in promoting the
de-differentiation of fibroblasts to induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs). A large family of microRNAs called the
ESCC microRNAs, including miR-302 and miR-372 in
humans, are strong inducers of iPSCs [15,16]. Indeed, it

has been suggested that these microRNAs together with
one or two other microRNAs can convert fibroblasts to
iPSCs in the absence of any transcription factors [17,18].
Recent work has begun to dissect the mRNA targets that
underlie the remarkable capacity of the ESCC family.
Subramanyam et al. show that microRNAs promote
reprogramming by simultaneously targeting several
critical cellular pathways including regulators of the
G1-S cell cycle checkpoint, the mesenchymal to epithelial
transition, and DNA methyl binding proteins [19].
However, these represent only a subset of the mRNAs
targeted by these microRNAs. For example, the ESCC
microRNAs also target mRNAs that regulate apoptosis
and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling,
although the role of these targets in reprogramming has
not been studied [20,21]. Dissection and functional
characterization of all of the ESCC targets should provide
a detailed and global view of how the microRNAs can
promote the transition. Similarly, characterization of all
the targets of miR-9 and miR-124 will provide insights on
how suppression of targets in a fibroblast eventually
results in the activation of the neuronal program.

The ability of microRNAs to act in the context of a cell
distantly related, in developmental terms, to the cell in
which the microRNAs are normally expressed is another
surprising feature of microRNA-induced transdifferentia-
tion. That is, while the microRNAs are not normally
expressed in the cell, their targets appear to be so. One
possibility is that a common set of genes is expressed in the
distantly related cell types and then largely regulated
through post-transcriptional rather than transcriptional
mechanisms. An example of such a target is BAF (Brg/Brm-
associated factor)53a. This protein is expressed in both
fibroblasts and neural progenitors. Previous work by the
Crabtree lab had shown that miR-124 and miR-9* target
the BAF53a transcript as neural progenitors differentiate
into neurons, thereby repressing protein production [22].
Suppression of BAF53a then leads to the upregulation of
BAF53b, an activator of neuronal genes. A similar switch
occurs in the microRNA-induced transition of fibroblasts
to neurons. While data are not shown or discussed in
detail, the authors mention that prolonging expression of
Baf53a and other known miR-124 neural progenitor cell
targets (PTPB1 [polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1],
REST [RE1-silencing transcription factor], coREST) only
partially blocks transdifferentiation, suggesting that these
targets play important roles, but do not alone explain the
remarkable transition. Of course these are only three of
the hundreds of targets of the two microRNAs. It will be
interesting to determine how many other targets are
shared in the transition of fibroblasts to neurons versus
neural progenitors to neurons (see Figure 1).

transdifferentiation to neurons

Similar microRNAs promote the transition of fibroblasts to neurons and
neural progenitors to neurons. The complete set of targets for these
microRNAs remain unknown. However, at least a subset including Baf53a,
REST, and PTBP1 are common to both fibroblasts and neural progenitors
suggesting overlapping pathways in the two transitions. Abbreviations: BAF,
Brg/Brm-associated factor; PTBP1, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1;
REST, RE1-silencing transcription factor.

The physiological role of microRNAs in
determining cell fate
Another question is how wide-spread is the capacity of
microRNAs to induce cell fate decisions across normal
developmental barriers? While there are many examples of
transcription factor-induced transdifferentiation across
germ layers, including recent studies that have shown
conversion of fibroblasts to hepatocytes and cardiomyo-
cytes using the respective lineage-specific transcription
factors [23,24], the variety of cell types using microRNAs
is less well known. Are there enough combinations of
microRNAs to underlie the remarkably diverse cell types in
the human body? Even within the neural lineage there is a
remarkable diversity of neural subtypes. It is unclear to what
degree each of these subtypes has a unique microRNA
signature, which could potentially drive their unique fate.
Indeed, there are many less microRNAs than there are
transcription factors – hundred versus thousands, respec-
tively. Furthermore, only a small number of micro-RNAs
have been shown to have specific tissue expression. Well-
known examples are miR-9 and miR-124 in the brain,
miR-1 in muscle, and miR-122 in liver. Both miR-1 and

miR-122 are promising candidates for promoting trans-
differentiation to their respective cell types. Other micro-
RNAs, such as the let-7 family, are broadly expressed across
all differentiated tissues and, hence, are likely general
stabilizers of the differentiated adult cell fate [25].

Future prospects
Together, these recent exciting findings have certainly
suggested that microRNAs may play an important role in
regenerative medicine. They are not only able to induce
cell fate transitions but are also likely to lead to profound
insights into the underlying molecular pathways and
cellular processes regulating those transitions. From a
clinical standpoint, microRNAs are an enticing potential
alternative to transcription factors. In particular, they can
be introduced relatively easily into cells in their mature
form without inducing the cell’s innate mature response.
In contrast, transcription factors need to be introduced as
DNA or as highly modified mRNAs. DNA is risky as it can
permanently alter the cell’s genome, while microRNAs
do not. microRNAs even exist stably within our plasma
and are thought to be naturally transferred from one cell
to another [26]. Therefore, the introduction of micro-
RNAs directly into patients to induce cell fate conver-
sions does not seem far-fetched. Therefore, both in basic
biology and translational medicine, microRNAs should
be an explosive field for years to come.
