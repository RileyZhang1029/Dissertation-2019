The chemolithoautotrophic strain Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor shows an unusual migration behav-
ior when cultivated in a gradient medium under high sulﬁde ﬂuxes. As common for
Beggiatoa spp., the ﬁlaments form a mat at the oxygen–sulﬁde interface. However, upon
prolonged incubation, a subpopulation migrates actively downward into the anoxic and
sulﬁdic section of the medium, where the ﬁlaments become gradually depleted in their
sulfur and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) inclusions. This depletion is correlated with the
production of hydrogen sulﬁde. The sulfur- and PHA-depleted ﬁlaments return to the
oxygen–sulﬁde interface, where they switch back to depositing sulfur and PHA by aerobic
sulﬁde oxidation. Based on these observations we conclude that internally stored elemental
sulfur is respired at the expense of stored PHA under anoxic conditions. Until now, nitrate
has always been assumed to be the alternative electron acceptor in chemolithoautotrophic
Beggiatoa spp. under anoxic conditions. As the medium and the ﬁlaments were free of
oxidized nitrogen compounds we can exclude this metabolism. Furthermore, sulfur respi-
ration with PHA under anoxic conditions has so far only been described for heterotrophic
Beggiatoa spp., but our medium did not contain accessible organic carbon. Hence the PHA
inclusions must originate from atmospheric CO2 ﬁxed by the ﬁlaments while at the oxygen–
sulﬁde interface.We propose that the directed migration of ﬁlaments into the anoxic section
of an oxygen–sulﬁde gradient system is used as a last resort to preserve cell integrity,
which would otherwise be compromised by excessive sulfur deposition occurring in the
presence of oxygen and high sulﬁde ﬂuxes. The regulating mechanism of this migration is
still unknown.

INTRODUCTION
The genus Beggiatoa comprises large, ﬁlamentous bacteria that
inhabit diverse sulﬁdic environments, such as sediments (Wino-
gradsky, 1887; Jørgensen, 1977; Nelson and Castenholz, 1982;
McHatton et al., 1996), springs (Winogradsky, 1887; Macalady
et al., 2006), and activated sludge (Farquhar and Boyle, 1971).
The motile ﬁlaments typically aggregate in a narrow overlapping
zone of opposed oxygen and sulﬁde diffusion gradients where they
form a sharply demarcated mat (Faust and Wolfe, 1961; Nelson
and Jannasch, 1983; Nelson et al., 1986). Within this mat, Beggia-
toa spp. oxidize sulﬁde with oxygen, depleting both compounds
(Nelson et al., 1986). This process is accompanied by deposition
of elemental sulfur inside the ﬁlaments.

Several ﬁlamentous and non-ﬁlamentous members of the Beg-
giatoaceae (Salman et al., 2011) are capable of anaerobic sulﬁde
oxidation with nitrate as electron acceptor (Fossing et al., 1995;
McHatton et al., 1996; Schulz et al., 1999). Dissimilatory nitrate
reduction enables these organisms to colonize anoxic environ-
ments such as deeper layers in sediments, microbial mats, or
gradient cultures (Sweerts et al., 1990; Mussmann et al., 2003;
Sayama et al., 2005; Kamp et al., 2006; Hinck et al., 2007; Jør-
gensen et al., 2010). Nitrate-based sulﬁde oxidation seems to have
been of great importance for some members of the Beggiatoaceae,

as suggested by their ability to highly concentrate nitrate from
the ambient water and store it in intracellular vacuoles (Fossing
et al., 1995; McHatton et al., 1996; Schulz et al., 1999; Sayama,
2001; Mussmann et al., 2003; Kalanetra et al., 2004, 2005; Hinck
et al., 2007). For example, internal nitrate concentrations of 4–
44 mM were found in narrow, hypersaline Beggiatoa spp. culti-
vated at an external nitrate concentration of 50 μM (McHatton
et al., 1996), whereas up to 100–800 mM of nitrate were reported
for marine Thiomargarita spp. cells from an environment with
ambient nitrate concentrations of 5–28 μM (Schulz et al., 1999).
However, also non-vacuolated strains were shown to use exter-
nally provided nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor (Sweerts
et al., 1990; Kamp et al., 2006).

We cultivated the chemolithoautotrophic, marine strain Beg-
giatoa sp. 35Flor in an agar-stabilized oxygen–sulﬁde gradient
medium. Upon prolonged incubation in the presence of medium
to high sulﬁde ﬂuxes, we observed an unusual migration behav-
ior, where a subpopulation of ﬁlaments moved downward from
the oxygen–sulﬁde interface. These ﬁlaments were able to survive
although sulﬁde concentrations were high and terminal electron
acceptors that are known to be used by Beggiatoa spp., i.e., oxygen
and nitrate, were not detectable in the medium or the ﬁlaments.
In this study we investigated the possibility of an alternative

sulﬁdic conditions, and discuss its possible ecological signiﬁcance
and link to the peculiar migration behavior.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STRAIN AND CULTIVATION
The strain Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor was enriched from a black band dis-
ease of scleractinian corals from the coast of Florida. The ﬁlaments
are about 6 μm wide (Kamp et al., 2008), and the cells contain a
central vacuole ﬁlled with polyphosphate (Brock and Schulz-Vogt,
2011). The strain can so far only be cultivated in the presence
of Pseudovibrio sp. FO-BEG1, which was isolated in pure culture
from the very same enrichment (Schwedt, unpublished). Different
attempts of obtaining a pure culture of Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor failed
so far, indicating that there is an important interaction between
these strains. However, the nature of this interaction is currently
not resolved and might not be speciﬁc. The clonal Beggiatoa
culture used in this study was eventually obtained by inoculat-
ing gradient media with a single, washed ﬁlament (Schulz-Vogt,
unpublished).

Cultivation was performed in tubes with an agar-based mineral
gradient medium designed for chemolithoautotrophic growth of
Beggiatoa spp. (Nelson et al., 1982; Nelson and Jannasch, 1983)
using artiﬁcial seawater (Kamp et al., 2008). The medium was
composed of a sulﬁdic bottom agar plug (1.5% w/v agar) cov-
ered with a sulﬁde-free, semisolid top agar layer (0.25% w/v
agar) of ∼5 cm height. Both agar layers were prepared by mix-
ing separately autoclaved salt and agar solutions. The salt solution
comprised 100 mL artiﬁcial seawater (470.57 mM NaCl, 24.6 mM

MgCl2·6H2O, 16.6 mM MgSO4·7H2O, 4.5 mM CaCl2·2H2O and
13.7 mM KCl; 27.5 g NaCl, 5 g MgCl2·6H2O, 4.1 g MgSO4·7H2O,
0.66 g CaCl2·2H2O, and 1.02 g KCl in 1 L distilled water), 2.9 g
−1 KOH in case of the bottom agar
NaCl, and 1 drop of 1 mol L
medium, or 240 mL artiﬁcial seawater and 4.32 g NaCl in case
of the top agar medium. The agar solution contained 80 mL dis-
tilled water and 2.7 g double-washed agar (bottom agar medium),
or 96 mL distilled water and 0.9 g double-washed agar (top agar
medium). The top agar medium further received sterile min-
eral solution (3.2 mM K2HPO4, 139.5 μM Na2MoO4, 3.9 mM
Na2S2O5, and 107.3 μM FeCl3·6H2O; 555 mg K2HPO4, 28.72 mg
Na2MoO4, 750 mg Na2S2O5, 29 mg FeCl3·6H2O in 1 L distilled
water), trace element, and vitamin solutions as speciﬁed in Kamp
−1 NaHCO3
et al. (2008) as well as 0.72 mL of a sterile 1 mol L
solution. The bottom agar medium was supplemented with 0.7–
−1 Na2S (4–20 mM ﬁnal concentration),
3.6 mL sterile 1 mol L
depending on the experiment. The medium was prepared free of
nitrate, nitrite, and nitric oxide, as veriﬁed by measurements with
an NOX analyzer (CLD 66, Eco Physics, Rösrath, Germany). Gas
exchange with the atmosphere was possible, and opposing gra-
dients of oxygen and sulﬁde were allowed to form for 1 to 2 days
before inoculation. The cultures were inoculated about 1 cm below
the air–agar interface using 100 μL of ﬁlament suspension from an
established mat. The cultures, from which the inoculum was taken,
were prepared as described above and grown under low sulﬁde
ﬂux conditions for 6–10 days. The inoculum contained Beggia-
toa sp. 35Flor ﬁlaments and Pseudovibrio sp. FO-BEG1 cells and
was free of oxidized nitrogen species as conﬁrmed with an NOX

analyzer. All incubations were performed at room temperature in
the dark.

Migration behavior of the Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor ﬁlaments was
investigated in culture tubes with variable ﬂuxes of sulﬁde from
the bottom agar. During these incubations, the distribution of ﬁl-
aments in the same tube was determined simultaneously with ver-
tical proﬁles of H2S and pH. Filaments from parallel culture tubes
were subsampled and used for microscopic determination of their
sulfur and PHA inclusions. Additional parallel tubes were used for
the measurement of oxygen and sulﬁde ﬂuxes, the proportion of
broken ﬁlaments and the internal sulfur content.

TRANSFER EXPERIMENT WITH SULFUR-FREE FILAMENTS
To verify that sulfur-free ﬁlaments from the anoxic subpopu-
lation of an aged culture (cultivated under high sulﬁde ﬂux)
were alive, able to migrate back to the oxygen–sulﬁde interface
and re-establish their sulﬁde-oxidizing metabolism, they were
transferred into the anoxic section of a fresh gradient medium
(low sulﬁde ﬂux conditions). All cultivation media were pre-
pared in plexiglass tubes (2× 12 cm in size) with lateral holes
(Brock and Schulz-Vogt, 2011). Fresh medium for inoculation
with sulfur-free ﬁlaments was pre-incubated with Pseudovibrio
sp. FO-BEG1. This was done to ensure a sufﬁcient cell density
of the accompanying bacterium irrespective of the inoculum as
it seems to be required for growth of Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor but
its abundance is negligible in the anoxic part of the gradient
medium. Subsequently, sulfur-free ﬁlaments were removed lat-
erally from the aged culture and injected laterally into the fresh
medium at a depth of about 1 cm below the oxygen–sulﬁde inter-
face. The media were inspected visually for development of a
mat.

MICROSENSOR MEASUREMENTS
Microsensors for O2 (OX-10 standard), H2S (H2S-10), and pH
(pH-10) were purchased from Unisense A/S (Aarhus, Denmark).
The external reference for the pH electrode was manufactured
and connected in-house. Calibration of the H2S sensor was per-
formed in anoxic, acidiﬁed artiﬁcial seawater (pH < 2) to which
anoxic Na2S stock solution was added stepwise. The exact sul-
ﬁde concentration of the stock solution was determined by
iodometric titration. Total sulﬁde (Stot) proﬁles were calcu-
lated from measured H2S and pH proﬁles using the equation
Stot = H2S× [1+ K 1/H3O
], with pK 1 = 6.569 at 21˚C and 39‰

salinity (Millero et al., 1988). The oxygen sensor was two-point
calibrated in a calibration chamber ﬁlled with artiﬁcial seawa-
ter. Signal readings were taken in water saturated with N2 and
ambient air. Oxygen concentrations at the respective salinity and
temperature were calculated according to Weiss (1970). The pH
electrode was calibrated using buffer solutions of pH 4.01, pH
7.00, and pH 9.21 (Mettler-Toledo, Giessen, Germany). All sensors
were calibrated immediately before the measurement. In case of
long time series measurements the sensor calibration was checked
afterward and a possible drift was corrected for. Sulﬁde ﬂuxes were
calculated using Fick’s ﬁrst law of diffusion (J =−D ∂c/∂x). The
−
diffusion coefﬁcient D for HS
was corrected for temperature
(21˚C) according to Jørgensen and Revsbech (1983), resulting in a
value of 1.56× 10

Sulfur reduction in marine Beggiatoa

Vertical proﬁling in 250 μm steps was performed with sen-
sors mounted on a motorized linear positioner (VT-80, Pollux
motor, Micos, Eschbach, Germany) controlled by a computer
using a software tool for automated microsensor measurements
(μ-Proﬁler, L. Polerecky, http://www.microsen-wiki.net). The sen-
sors were aligned by manually adjusting their tips to the air–agar
interface using a dissecting microscope (Stemi 2000-C, Zeiss, Jena,
Germany).

FILAMENT IMAGING
The distribution of sulfur-containing Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor ﬁla-
ments in gradient cultures was monitored using time-lapse pho-
tography. An amber light-emitting diode (LXHL-NM98, Luxeon,
Philips, San Jose, CA, USA) was positioned below the culture tube
and switched on for 1 s when an image was taken with a cooled
CCD camera (Sensicam, PCO, Kelheim, Germany). Illumination
and image acquisition in 10 min intervals were controlled by a
custom-written computer program (Look@Molli, B. Grunwald,
http://www.microsen-wiki.net).

Intensities in the recorded images were horizontally averaged
over an area with visible ﬁlaments (∼5 mm wide, ∼2 cm high),
and the resulting vertical proﬁles were assembled into a 2D map
with the x-axis representing incubation time and the y-axis cor-
responding to depth. Since the average image intensity was pro-
portional to the density of sulfur globules, which were present
exclusively inside ﬁlaments, vertical movement of sulfur-rich ﬁla-
ments was detected as a change in the shape of the vertical intensity
proﬁle. In contrast, an increase and decrease in the proﬁle inten-
sity that was not accompanied with the change in the proﬁle shape
indicated accumulation and depletion of sulfur inside the ﬁla-
ments, respectively. Because this method relied on light scattering
from sulfur inclusions, it did not allow visualization of sulfur-free
ﬁlaments.

STAINING OF INTERNAL PHA
Staining with Nile Red was used to visualize PHA inclusions in the
ﬁlaments. A subsample of 90 μL from a culture tube was incubated
for 5 min with 10 μL of a Nile Red (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim,
−1 in dimethyl sulfoxide).
Germany) staining solution (25 mg L
The ﬁlament suspension was transferred onto a poly-l-lysine
(Sigma-Aldrich) coated microscope slide for immobilization of
the ﬁlaments. Fluorescence of Nile Red was excited with a laser
at 546 nm and emission was recorded above 590 nm (ﬁlter set
15, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using an epiﬂuorescence microscope
(Axiophot equipped with AxioCam MRm, Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

IDENTIFICATION OF INTERNAL SULFUR
Under a bright-ﬁeld microscope, internal sulfur globules in Beg-
giatoa spp. usually appear as highly refractive, round inclusion
bodies inside the ﬁlaments. We used high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) to conﬁrm that the globules observed
in the studied strain Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor were indeed composed
of sulfur. A suspension of ﬁlaments was ﬁxed with 3.2% (v/v)
formaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature. Two 1 mL subsamples
were mixed with 2 mL artiﬁcial seawater or HPLC-grade methanol
(Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany), and shaken over night in
glass vials. Filaments from both treatments were examined micro-
scopically the next day. The methanol extract was centrifuged at

13.000 rpm (Centrifuge 5417R, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany)
for 5 min to remove agar and cell debris. The supernatant was ﬁl-
tered (Acrodisc syringe ﬁlter 4472, Pall Life Science, NY, USA) and
subsequently measured by HPLC (Kamyshny et al., 2009), using
elemental sulfur standards as reference.

MONITORING OF BEGGIATOA sp. 35FLOR CELL INTEGRITY
The proportion of damaged ﬁlaments in cultures grown for 7
and 13 days under low and high sulﬁde ﬂux conditions was quan-
tiﬁed by visual inspection using a microscope. Samples of the
mat at the oxygen–sulﬁde interface were taken from three parallel
tubes per sulﬁde ﬂux treatment, and the proportion was calculated
from about 150–200 ﬁlaments counted per each sample. The sig-
niﬁcance of differences between treatments (high vs. low sulﬁde
ﬂux) and points of time were evaluated with a t -test, using log-
transformed percentages of damaged ﬁlaments to ensure variance
homogeneity between the compared data sets.

RESULTS
MIGRATION OF BEGGIATOA sp. 35FLOR IN GRADIENT CULTURES
Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor ﬁlaments aggregated and formed a dense
mat at the oxygen–sulﬁde interface within the gradient medium
(Figure 2A and Movie S1 in Supplementary Material). In cultures
with medium to high sulﬁde ﬂuxes (Table 1) a subpopulation
of ﬁlaments began a downward migration to the anoxic zone
about 3–4 days after establishment of the mat. For medium sulﬁde
ﬂuxes, this migration resulted in a layer with homogenous ﬁla-
ment density extending up to 2–3 mm below the mat (Figure 1).
In contrast, for high sulﬁde ﬂuxes, the migrating ﬁlaments were
not homogeneously distributed but progressively aggregated in
a region distinctly separated from the mat at the oxygen–sulﬁde
interface (Figures 1 and 2B). Because the aggregation of ﬁlaments
in the anoxic part increased the chance of detecting metabolic
products all further experiments were conducted with cultures
growing under a high sulﬁde ﬂux.

Migration of ﬁlaments in cultures with a high sulﬁde ﬂux fol-
lowed a general pattern illustrated in Figure 2E. During the initial
3–4 days of incubation, the mat at the oxygen–sulﬁde interface
gradually formed. After about 6–7 days the sulfur-globule density
in the mat decreased moderately, followed by a more pronounced
decrease after 8–9 days. These decreases were correlated with two
pronounced events of downward migration at days 5–6 and 7–8,
respectively (arrows 1 and 2 in Figure 2E). After reaching a depth of

around 10 mm, the migrating ﬁlaments formed a layer of increased
ﬁlament density. These ﬁlaments slowly disappeared from view
due to a gradual loss of their internal sulfur granules. The disap-
pearance of ﬁlaments was accompanied by a parallel increase in
the sulfur-globule density in the mat at the oxygen–sulﬁde inter-
face (arrow 3 in Figure 2E), suggesting that the sulfur-depleted
ﬁlaments returned to this zone and switched back to sulﬁde oxi-
dation, thereby depositing sulfur. This was conﬁrmed by transfer
experiments, which showed that sulfur-depleted ﬁlaments trans-
ferred from the anoxic subpopulation of an aged culture into the
anoxic section of a fresh gradient medium formed, within 12 days,
a new mat of sulfur-containing ﬁlaments at the oxygen–sulﬁde
interface.

SULFIDE PRODUCTION BY FILAMENTS IN THE ANOXIC SECTION
Throughout the incubation, sulﬁde oxidation in the mat at the
oxygen–sulﬁde interface was conﬁrmed by pronounced acidiﬁca-
tion and steep gradients of total sulﬁde (Figures 2C,D). A small
but detectable peak in the H2S proﬁle was observed at a depth of
∼10 mm when the anoxic subpopulation was present (Figure 2D).
As pH varied only smoothly with depth in this region, the H2S
peak was not caused by pH variation but indicated a true pro-
duction of sulﬁde at and around this depth. This production
was strongly spatially and temporally correlated with the pres-
ence of the anoxic subpopulation (Figure 2F), suggesting that it
was linked to the metabolic activity of the ﬁlaments from this
subpopulation.

CELL INTEGRITY, SULFUR AND PHA CONTENT OF SINGLE FILAMENTS
Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor ﬁlaments accumulated elemental sulfur and
PHA during growth at the oxygen–sulﬁde interface. Sulfur inclu-
sions were visible as dark, highly refractive globules in bright-ﬁeld
micrographs (Figures 3A,B). These globules disappeared when
ﬁlaments were treated with methanol, and the corresponding
extracts featured a single pronounced peak in the HPLC chro-
matogram at the retention time of 3.738 min± 0.007 (n = 27),
which matched the sulfur standard peak at 3.728 min± 0.006

FIGURE 1 | Distribution of Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor ﬁlaments over depth in
gradient cultures with different sulﬁde ﬂuxes after 6 (open symbols)
and 12 (closed symbols) days of cultivation. The ﬂux values were

(n = 9). PHA inclusions appeared as strongly ﬂuorescent globules
in images of Nile Red-stained samples (Figure 3E). With increas-
ing sulﬁde ﬂux the amount of internal sulfur strongly increased
(compare Figures 3A,B), whereas PHA inclusions were equally
abundant in all treatments (data not shown). When grown under
high sulﬁde ﬂux, most ﬁlaments from the mat at the oxygen–
sulﬁde interface were densely ﬁlled with sulfur and PHA inclusions
(Figures 3B,E). In contrast, ﬁlaments from the anoxic subpopu-
lation were heterogeneous with respect to their inclusion density;
while some were densely ﬁlled with sulfur and PHA, others lacked
both (Figures 3D,F).

The proportion of damaged ﬁlaments (Figure 3C) from the
mat at the oxygen–sulﬁde interface increased with sulﬁde ﬂux. In
cultures growing for 1 week under low sulﬁde ﬂux, most ﬁlaments
were intact, with only 0.9%± 1.0 (n = 3) ﬁlaments damaged,
whereas this proportion was signiﬁcantly higher (13.2%± 3.3,
n = 3, p = 0.011) in cultures grown at high sulﬁde ﬂux. The
proportion of damaged ﬁlaments also increased with time: after
2 weeks of growth, this increase was signiﬁcant for cultures with
high sulﬁde ﬂux (50.1%± 7.2, n = 3, p = 0.007) but not in cultures
with low sulﬁde ﬂux (2.0%± 1.5, n = 3, p = 0.429).

DISCUSSION
Sulﬁde production by members of the genus Beggiatoa is known
from chemoheterotrophic strains that were cultivated in liquid
medium and artiﬁcially exposed to short-term anoxic conditions
(Schmidt et al., 1987). Based on those experiments it was hypothe-
sized that sulfur respiration may provide Beggiatoa spp. in gradient
systems with energy for return from the anoxic zone to the oxygen–
sulﬁde interface under changing environmental conditions. In this
study, we cultivated the chemolithoautotropically growing strain
Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor in an oxygen–sulﬁde gradient medium, and
observed a directed migration of the ﬁlaments from the oxygen–
sulﬁde interface into the anoxic and sulﬁdic zone where they
reduced internal sulfur to sulﬁde. This suggested an alternative or
additional function of sulfur respiration in Beggiatoa ﬁlaments.

We propose that the observed behavior is a “last resort” survival
strategy of Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor at prolonged incubation under
high sulﬁde ﬂuxes. Under this condition the ﬁlaments become
densely ﬁlled with sulfur and were often observed to burst. By
moving to the anoxic zone of the gradient system, the ﬁlaments
can prevent further deposition of sulfur through aerobic sulﬁde
oxidation and even reduce the amount of storage compounds by
sulfur respiration with PHA. Sulfur-depleted ﬁlaments can even-
tually migrate back to the oxygen–sulﬁde interface, where they
resume aerobic sulﬁde oxidation and accumulate new sulfur glob-
ules. An involvement of the accompanying Pseudovibrio sp. strain
in the observed migration and metabolism is unlikely due to its
negligible abundance in the region of the anoxic subpopulation
(Schwedt, unpublished).

SULFUR RESPIRATION FOR REGULATION OF THE AMOUNT OF STORED
SULFUR
The alternation between sulﬁde oxidation and sulfur reduction
in spatially separated environments seems to allow Beggiatoa
sp. 35Flor to control the amount of stored sulfur beyond the
scope of enzymatic regulation. Sulﬁde is oxidized aerobically by

Beggiatoa spp. in a two-step process via internally stored sul-
fur (2H2S+ O2 → 2S0 + 2H2O) further to sulfate (2S0 + 3O2 +
2H2O → 2SO2−
+). The regulation of these reactions is
unknown in Beggiatoa spp., but the presence of internal sulfur
globules demonstrates that the two reactions are not always well
balanced. Principally, a balanced sulfur content can be achieved
by either down-regulating sulﬁde oxidation or up-regulating sul-
fur oxidation. Possibly, sulﬁde oxidation is controlled kinetically
and cannot be regulated by the cell, because both O2 and H2S
freely diffuse into the cytoplasm. This is supported by observa-
tions on other closely related ﬁlamentous and non-ﬁlamentous

large sulfur bacteria, which both immediately increase their res-
piration rate upon addition of sulﬁde to the medium (Schulz
and de Beer, 2002; Høgslund et al., 2009). Moreover, Fenchel and
Bernard (1995) reported for marine Beggiatoa spp. that the sul-
ﬁde ﬂux into the mat did not drop after the oxygen ﬂux was
decreased, indicating that the ratio of sulﬁde oxidation to sul-
fur oxidation shifted to favor sulﬁde. Therefore, up-regulation
of sulfur oxidation seems the more likely mechanism to bal-
ance the internal sulfur content. However, at high sulﬁde ﬂuxes
the frequently observed bursting of Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor ﬁla-
ments that were densely ﬁlled with sulfur globules indicates that

is pH-neutral, is in agreement with the observed pH proﬁles.
Oxidation of stored sulfur was most probably not performed by
ﬁlaments of the anoxic subpopulation, as oxygen and nitrate,
which are the electron acceptors known to be used by mem-
bers of the Beggiatoaceae, were not present. This is supported by
the fact that we did not observe a decrease in pH at the corre-
sponding depth interval in the gradient medium, which would
be a sign of sulfuric acid production through oxidation of sul-
fur with oxygen (2S + 3O2 + 2H2O → 2SO2−

nitrate (5S + 6NO
or 4S +

disproportionation would produce sulfuric acid (4S + 4H2O →
3H2S+ SO2−
+). The ﬁlaments of the anoxic subpopulation
seem to gain energy chemoorganotrophically from oxidation of
PHA with sulfur. However, no accessible source of ﬁxed carbon
is present in the medium, so that the PHA must have been previ-
ously synthesized through CO2 ﬁxation during chemolithotrophic
growth on oxygen and sulﬁde at the oxygen–sulﬁde interface. Gen-
eration of PHA through excess CO2 ﬁxation was not described for
Beggiatoa spp. so far, but is known from other bacteria (Schlegel
et al., 1961). By reducing stored sulfur with a carbon reserve
compound created previously through costly CO2 ﬁxation, the
ﬁlaments did not exploit environmental resources in the anoxic
environment. Instead, this process might be used by Beggiatoa sp.
35Flor as the only possibility to empty storage space under high
sulﬁde ﬂuxes.

Bright ﬂuorescence in (E) originates from PHA inclusions, whereas lower
ﬂuorescence in (F) is due to staining of the cell membrane lipids.

further up-regulation of sulfur oxidation did not occur, e.g., due
to enzymatic rate limitation.

As an alternative to enzymatic regulation, the ﬁlaments may
leave the overlapping zone of oxygen and sulﬁde in order to
starve themselves of external electron donor or acceptor, thereby
interrupting sulfur deposition. A negative chemotactic response
to oxygen (Møller et al., 1985) presumably prevented the ﬁla-
ments from moving upward into the oxic section of the gradient
system. Instead, they migrated downward into the anoxic and
sulﬁdic section, where sulﬁde could no longer be oxidized to
sulfur due to the lack of an electron acceptor. It is surprising
that these ﬁlaments moved into the sulﬁdic zone, because ele-
vated sulﬁde concentrations have previously been reported to
be toxic for Beggiatoa spp. (Winogradsky, 1887; Keil, 1912; Nel-
son et al., 1986). However, all earlier studies were done under
oxic conditions. Our study indicates that Beggiatoa sp. 35Flor
can tolerate higher sulﬁde concentrations under anoxic con-
ditions, whereas under oxic conditions high sulﬁde concentra-
tions can cause cell death indirectly by inducing excessive sulfur
accumulation.

METABOLISM OF BEGGIATOA IN THE ANOXIC ZONE OF GRADIENT
SYSTEMS
The depletion of sulfur and polyhydroxyalkanoate inclusions
together with the production of sulﬁde suggests that Beggiatoa

The presence of ﬁlamentous Beggiatoaceae in the anoxic section
of oxygen–sulﬁde gradient systems has so far been shown in mul-
tiple laboratory and ﬁeld studies (Sweerts et al., 1990; Mussmann
et al., 2003; Kamp et al., 2006; Hinck et al., 2007; Preisler et al.,
2007; Jørgensen et al., 2010). However, in these systems nitrate
was present either externally or internally and could have been
used for oxidizing reduced sulfur compounds in the anoxic zone
of the sediment. Nitrate respiration could, however, be excluded in
our experiments as NOX compounds were absent from medium
and ﬁlaments.

THE ROLE OF SULFUR REDUCTION BY BEGGIATOA spp. IN THE
ENVIRONMENT
The migration behavior and sulfur reduction by Beggiatoa ﬁla-
ments described in our study may occur and play the same role
also in natural habitats. This is supported by the fact that the sulﬁde
ﬂuxes in our cultures (Table 1) were well within the range of ﬂuxes
previously measured in different natural Beggiatoa mats (Table 2),
and that a strong heterogeneity in internal sulfur content of Beg-
giatoa ﬁlaments was also observed for ﬁlaments collected from
natural mats (Sassen et al., 1993; Bernard and Fenchel, 1995).
We suggest that, in natural habitats, ﬁlaments respond to high
sulﬁde ﬂuxes either by moving laterally to an adjacent region
with a lower ﬂux or, if this is not possible, by migrating verti-
cally into the sulﬁdic and anoxic sediment section below, where
they respire sulfur (Figure 4). However, the conditions at which

these phenomena occur will depend on the possible maximum
oxidation rates of sulﬁde and ultimately sulfur, which likely deﬁne
the tolerance of different Beggiatoa species toward high sulﬁde
ﬂuxes.

FIGURE 4 | Proposed function of sulfur reduction as a survival strategy
of Beggiatoa spp. under high sulﬁde ﬂuxes. In locations with high sulﬁde
ﬂuxes (right side) ﬁlaments become excessively ﬁlled with sulfur (black
dots inside the ﬁlaments), because the oxidation rates of sulﬁde to sulfur
(K 1) and sulfur to sulfate (K 2) are not well balanced (K 1 > K 2). To prevent
bursting, the ﬁlaments could move into a region with a lower sulﬁde ﬂux
(black arrow) where these two reactions may proceed in a balanced way. If
this is not possible, ﬁlaments could leave the oxygen–sulﬁde interface and
move down into the anoxic region to reduce their internal sulfur deposits
and thus prevent bursting (white arrow). They do so by using internally
stored PHA as an electron donor to reduce S0 to H2S. After emptying
storage space, the ﬁlaments return to the oxygen–sulﬁde interface, and
continue with aerobic sulﬁde oxidation.
