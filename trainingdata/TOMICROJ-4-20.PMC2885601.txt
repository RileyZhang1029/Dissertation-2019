Abstract:  The  secreted  Mac  protein  made  by  group  A  Streptococcus  (GAS)  inhibits  opsonophagocytosis  of  GAS  by  
human  polymorphonuclear  leukocytes  (PMNs).  This  protein  also  has  the  endopeptidase  activity  against  human  
immunoglobulin G (IgG), and the Cys94, His262 and Asp284 are critical for the enzymatic activity. The horse pathogen 
Streptococcus  equi  subspecies  equi  produces  a  homologue  of  Mac  (SeMac).  SeMac  was  characterized  to  determine 
whether  SeMac  has  IgG  endopeptidase  activity  and  inhibits  opsonophagocytosis  of  S.  equi  by  horse  PMNs.  The  gene  
was  cloned  and  recombinant  SeMac  was  overexpressed  in  Escherichia  coli  and  purified  to  homogeneity.  Mice  with  
experimental S. equi infection and horses with strangles caused by S. equi seroconverted to SeMac, indicating that SeMac 
is  produced  in  vivo  during  infection.  SeMac  has  endopeptidase  activity  against  human  IgG.  However,  the  protein  just 
cleaves  a  small  fraction,  which  may  be  IgG1  only,  of  horse  IgG.  Replacement  of  Cys102  with  Ser  or  His272  with  Ala 
abolishes the enzymatic activity of SeMac, and the Asp294Ala mutation greatly decreases the enzymatic activity. SeMac 
does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs but opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs. Thus, 
SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase with a limited activity against horse IgG and must have other function. 

Keywords: IgG, Endopeptidase SeMac, opsonophagocytosis, polymorphonuclear leukocytes.  

INTRODUCTION 

  Gram-positive  bacterium  Streptococcus  equi  subspeices 
equi  (S.  equi)  causes  equine  strangles,  a  highly  contagious 
purulent  lymphadenitis  and  one  of  the  most  common  infec-
tious  diseases  in  horses  [1,2].  The  infection  initially  causes 
nasal  discharge  and  fever  and,  then,  leads  to  abscess  forma-
tion in local lymph nodes, causing enormous pain and respi-
ratory  difficulty.  There  is  massive  infiltration  of  polymor-
phonuclear  leukocytes  (PMNs)  to  the  infection  site.  How-
ever, S. equi effectively evades the horse innate immunity by 
being  resistant  to  phagocytosis  by  PMNs.  Horses  recovered 
from  strangles  acquire  immunity  against  S.  equi  reinfection 
[3].  The  immunity  is  primarily  mediated  by  protective  anti-
bodies [4], which opsonize and thus enhance phagocytosis of 
S. equi by horse PMNs. 

  To  survive  in  hosts,  bacterial  pathogens  have  evolved 
multiple  mechanisms  to  evade  host  defense.  For  examples, 
both  S.  equi  and  group  A  Streptococcus  (GAS)  produce  the 
hyaluronic  acid  capsule  and  surface  protein  M  protein  to 
contribute to resistance to phagocytosis by PMNs. We found 
that  GAS  produces  a  secreted  Mac  protein  (also  known  as 
IdeE), which inhibits opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human 
PMNs [5]. This protein can cleave the heavy chain of human 
immunoglobulin  G  (IgG)  using  Cys94,  His262  and  Asp284 
as  its  catalytic  triad  [6-8].  There  are  two  kinds  of  Mac

produced  by  GAS  isolates  [7],  which  use  different  mecha-
nisms  to  block  the  interaction  between  IgG  and  Fc  receptor 
on  the  surface  of  PMNs.  The  type-1  Mac,  such  as  M1  Mac  
produced  by  serotype  M1  GAS  strains,  has  high  enzymatic 
activity  and  low  affinity  to  Fc  receptor  on  the  surface  of 
PMNs,  while  the  type-2  Mac  can  bind  to  the  Fc  receptor  
and  has  lower  enzymatic  activity  [9].  S.  equi  has  a  homo-
logue  of  GAS  M1  Mac  (designated  SeMac).  In  this  study, 
SeMac  was  prepared  and  characterized.  The  results  indicate 
that  SeMac  is  a  cysteine  endopeptidase  but  does  not  inhibit 
opsonophagocytosis  of  S.  equi  by  horse  PMNs,  suggesting 
that  SeMac  has  function  other  than  evading  horse  acquired 
immunity against S. equi infection. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Materials 

Purified  horse  IgG1  and  a  mixture  of  horse  IgG1  and 
 
IgG4 were kindly provided by Dr. Bettina Wagner at Cornell 
University.  S.  equi-specific  mouse  sera  were  obtained  from 
adult female outbred CD-1 Swiss mice (Charles River Labo-
ratories,  Wilmington,  Mass.)  21  days  after  they  were  inocu-
lated  subcutaneously  with  1  x  107  cfu  S.  equi  strain SEM1. 
Convalescent  sera  from  3  horses  suffering  from  strangles 
were  obtained  30  days  after  diagnosis.  GAS  M1  Mac  was 
prepared as previously described [5]. 

Bacterial Strains and Growth 

 
Six  of  10  S.  equi  strains  used  were  kindly  provided  by 
Dr.  James  Musser  at  Methodist  Hospital,  Houston,  Texas,

and these strains were isolated more than 20 years ago from 
horses with strangles in the Eastern U.S. (4 strains), Brazil (1 
strain),  and  Finland  (1  strain).  The  other  4  strains  were  iso-
lated in 2003 from horses with strangles in Livingston (des-
ignated  strain  SEM1)  [10],  Pony,  Great  Fall,  and  Norris  in 
Montana.  GAS  strain  MGAS5005  (serotype  M1)  has  been 
described  [11].  Escherichia  coli  Novablue  and  BL21(DE3) 
(Novagen,  Madison,  Wis.)  were  used  for  gene  cloning  and 
protein  expression,  respectively.  S.  equi  and  GAS  strains 
were routinely grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco Laborato-
ries,  Detroit,  Mich.)  supplemented  with  0.2%  yeast  extract 
(THY) in 5% CO2 at 37°C. THY agar and tryptose agar with 
5% sheep blood (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) were 
used as the solid media. 

Gene Cloning and Mutagenesis 

lacks 

  The  gene  fragment  encoding  mature  SeMac  was  cloned 
from  SEM1  with  primers  5’-ACCATGGACGA  TTAC-
CAAAGGAATGCTAC-3’  and  5’-CGAATTCT  TAGCT- 
CAGTTTCTGCCATATG-3’.  The  protein  made  from  this 
cloned  fragment 
the  presumed  secretion  signal  
sequence (amino acids 1-34). The PCR product was digested 
with NcoI and EcoRI and ligated into pET-21d (Novagen) to 
yield  recombinant  plasmid  pSEMAC.  The  cloned  gene  was 
sequenced  and  had  identical  DNA  sequence  with  the  corre-
sponding  open  reading  frame  of  S.  equi  genome  database 
[12].  Amino  acid  replacement  of  Cys102  and  His272  or 
Asp294  of  SeMac  with  serine  and  alanine,  respectively,  
was  achieved  by  site-directed  mutagenesis  using  the  Quick-
Change  Mutagenesis  kit  (Stratagene,  La  Jolla,  Calif.).  The 
entire mutated gene was sequenced to confirm the mutations 
and rule out spurious mutations. 

Expression and Purification of Recombinant SeMac 

  Recombinant  SeMac  was  purified  from  E.  coli  BL21 
(DE3) containing plasmid pSEMAC. Bacteria were grown to 
optical  density  at  600  nm  of  0.5  in  6  liters  of  Luria-Bertani 
broth  supplemented  with  100  mg  of  ampicillin  per  liter  at 
37°C, and SeMac expression was then induced with 0.5 mM 
IPTG  6  h.  Solutions  used  in  purification  were  buffered  with 
10  mM  Tris-HCl  (pH  8.0).  Cell  paste  was  sonicated  for  15 
min at 4°C in 60 ml of the buffer, and centrifuged at 15,000 
g  for  10  min.  The  supernatant  obtained  was  loaded  onto  a 
DEAE-Sepharose  column  (2.5  by  10  cm).  The  column  was 
washed with 50 ml of Tris-HCl, and SeMac was eluted with 
200  ml  of  50  mM  NaCl.  SeMac  was  identified  by  sodium 
dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel  electrophoresis  (SDS-
PAGE), and peak fractions were pooled. Ammonium sulfate 
was  added  to  the  pool  to  a  concentration  of  1.2  M,  and  the 
resulting solution was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column 
(1.5 x 10 cm). The column was washed with 50 ml of 1.2 M 
(NH4)2SO4 and eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 1.2 to 
0.7  M  (NH4)2SO4.  Fractions  containing  the  protein  were 
pooled. The pooled protein was precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 
at 70% of saturation, centrifuged, dialyzed against 3 liters of 
10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) overnight, and loaded onto 
a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.5 by 10 cm). The protein was 
eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 2 to 8 mM NaCl and 
pooled.  The  pooled  protein  was  concentrated  by  (NH4)2SO4 
precipitation  and  dialyzed  against  Tris-HCl  as  described 
above. 

DNA Sequencing 

  Genomic  DNA  was  isolated  with  a  FastDNA  SPIN  Kit 
(Qbiogene,  Calsdad,  Calif.)  according  to  manufacturer’s 
protocol.  A  DNA  fragment  containing S.  equi  mac  was  am-
plified by PCR using the genomic DNA samples and primers 
5’-GCATCTCTACTATCTCATCAC-3’  and  5’-ACAGGC- 
ACATTAATGTTTAAC-3’. Sequences of the PCR products 
were obtained from both DNA strands with an Applied Bio-
system 310 automated sequencer (Applied BioSystems, Inc., 
Foster City, Calif.). 

Anti-SeMac antisera 

 
Four  female  outbred  CD-1  Swiss  mice  (4-week-old) 
(Charles  River  Laboratories)  were  immunized  subcutane-
ously with 50 (cid:1)g of recombinant SeMac suspended in 200 (cid:1)l 
of  saline  emulsified  in  44  (cid:1)l  of  monophosphoryl  lipid  A-
synthetic 
trehalose  dicorynomycolate  adjuvant  (Corixa, 
Hamilton,  Mont.).  The  animals  were  anesthetized  by  isoflu-
rane  inhalation  prior  to  immunization  and  blood  collection. 
Blood was collected prior to active immunization to prepare 
control sera. Mice were boosted at weeks 2 and 4 with 50 (cid:1)g 
of  protein  mixed  with  the  adjuvant.  Anti-SeMac  antiserum 
was  prepared  from  blood  obtained  1  week  after  the  second 
booster. 

Phagocytosis Assay 

 
Phagocytosis  assay  was  performed  as  described  previ-
ously [13, 14]. Briefly, S. equi SEM1 and GAS bacteria from 
exponential  growth  phase  in  THY  were  washed  with  phos-
phate-buffered  saline  (PBS)  and  labeled  with  0.75  μg/ml 
FITC in PBS at 37°C for 20 min. The labeled bacteria were 
washed and resuspended at 1 x 109 cfu/ml in PBS. Ten μl of 
the labeled bacteria were mixed with 100 μl of non-immune 
heparinized horse or human blood with or without 100 μg/ml 
SeMac and incubated with gentle shaking at 37°C for 5, 10, 
or  20  min.  The  samples  were  immediately  processed  using 
an  Immunolyse  Kit  (Beckman  Coulter)  according  to  the 
manufacturer’s  protocol  and  analyzed  by  flow  cytometry. 
The percentage of PMNs with fluorescent bacteria was used 
as a measure of phagocytosis efficiency. 

Other Assays  

  To  assess  IgG  endopeptidase  activity  of  SeMac,  human, 
mouse or horse IgG (20 μg) was incubated with E. coli lysate 
containing  SeMac  proteins  or  1  μg  purified  SeMac  or  GAS 
M1 Mac in PBS at 37° for 90 min, and the reaction mixture 
was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western immunoblot analysis, 
which was performed as described previously [15], was used 
to  assess  in  vitro  SeMac  production  and  the  presence  of  Se-
Mac-specific  antibody  in  the  horse  and  mouse  convalescent 
sera.  Culture  supernatant  proteins  of  S.  equi,  which  were 
used to assess the  in vitro SeMac production, were prepared 
by the method of Lei et al. [16]. 

RESULTS 

S. equi Mac Gene 

S.  equi  genome  encodes  a  Mac  homologue  SeMac.  The 
 
protein  shares  62.4%  identity  in  amino  acid  sequence  with 
Mac  made  by  serotype  M1  GAS  and  a  putative  secretion

signal  sequence  (amino  acids  1-34),  and  the  catalytic  resi-
dues  of  GAS  Mac  consisting  of  Cys94,  His262  and  Asp284 
are conserved in SeMac (Cys102, His272 and Asp 294) (Fig. 
1).  To  test  whether  other S.  equi  strains  have  the mac  gene, 
10 S. equi isolates representing various geographic locations 
were  tested  with  PCR  using  mac-specific  primers.  All  the 
strains  tested  had  the  mac  gene  (Fig.  2).  DNA  sequencing 
found  that  the  mac  gene  is  100%  conserved  in  DNA  
sequence in these strains. 

Recombinant SeMac and In Vitro and In Vivo Expression 
of SeMac 

  To characterize SeMac, the fragment of S. equi mac gene 
encoding  mature  SeMac  was  cloned,  and  recombinant  
SeMac  was  purified  to  >95%  purity  as  assessed  by  SDS-
PAGE (Fig. 3A). To assess the in vitro production of SeMac, 
culture supernatant of the 10 S. equi strains was prepared by 
the  method  of  Lei  et  al.  [16],  resolved  by  SDS-PAGE,  and 
probed  by  Western  immunoblot  with  anti-SeMac  mouse  
antisera.  No  SeMac  was  detected  in  all  the  samples  (data  
not  shown),  suggesting  that  SeMac  is  not  produced in  vitro. 
To  test  whether  SeMac  is  produced  in  vivo  during  S.  equi 
infection,  the  presence  of  SeMac-specific  antibody  was  
assessed by Western immunoblot analysis with convalescent 
sera  from  3  horses  suffered  from  strangles  and  mice  with 
experimental  S.  equi  infection.  All  the  convalescent  sera 
tested had SeMac-specific antibody (Fig. 3B), indicating that 
SeMac is produced in vivo during infection. 

Endopeptidase  Activity  of  SeMac  against  Horse  IgG1 
and Human IgG 

  GAS  Mac  can  cleave  the  heavy  chain  of  human  IgG  at 
the  lower  hinge  region  between  Fab  and  Fc  fragments.  A 
catalytic  triad  of  Cys94,  His262,  and  Asp284  residues  is 
critical for the enzymatic activity of GAS Mac [7, 8]. SeMac 
possesses putative catalytic residues of Cys102, His272, and 
Asp294 (Fig. 1). To determine whether SeMac also is a cys-
teine  endopeptidase  targeting  IgG,  Cys102  and  His272  or 
Asp294  of  SeMac  were  replaced  with  Ser  and  Ala,  respec-
tively,  by  site-directed  mutagenesis,  and  wild-type  and  mu-
(SeMacCys102Ser,  SeMacHis272Ala  and  SeMacAsp294Ala)  
tant 
SeMac proteins expressed in E. coli were tested for IgG en-
dopeptidase  activity  using  human  IgG.  Wild-type  SeMac 
cleaved the heavy chain of human IgG, while SeMacCys102Ser 
and  SeMacHis272Ala  completely  lost  the  IgG  endopeptidase 
activity,  and  SeMacAsp294Ala  had  dramatically  lower  enzy-
matic  activity  than  the  wild-type  protein  (Fig.  4A).  The  re-
sults  indicate  that SeMac  is  a cysteine  endopeptidase, which 

uses  Cys102,  His272  and  Asp294  as  its  catalytic  triad  to 
cleave human IgG.

Purified  recombinant  SeMac  and  GAS  Mac  were  then 
tested  for  activity  to  cleave  horse  IgG.  While  both  proteins 
cleaved human IgG efficiently, only a small fraction of horse 
IgG was cleaved by either protein (Fig. 4B), suggesting that 
SeMac  or  GAS  Mac  cannot  digest  all  subgroups  of  horse 
IgG. To test this possibility, available horse IgG1 and a mix-
ture  of  IgG1  and  IgG4  were  treated  with  SeMac  or  GAS 
Mac.  SeMac  or  GAS  Mac  cleaved  a  small  portion  of  the 
IgG1/IgG4  mixture,  but  not  IgG4.  Therefore,  the  Mac  pro-
teins can cleave IgG1 but not IgG4. Due to the unavailability 
of other purified subgroup IgG, it is not known whether Se-
Mac cleaves the other IgG subgroups. 

ing  that  SeMac  does  not  inhibit  opsonophagocytosis  of  S. 
equi by horse PMNs. 

  The inability of SeMac to inhibit S. equi opsonophagocy-
tosis by horse PMNs may be due to its inability to cleave the 
majority  of  horse  IgG.  If  this  is  true,  SeMac  should  inhibit 
opsonophagocytosis  of  GAS  by  human  PMNs,  since  SeMac 
efficiently  cleaves  human  IgG.  To  test  this  idea,  the  phago-
cytosis  assay  was  repeated  using  GAS  and  human  blood. 
SeMac  indeed  inhibits  the  opsonophagocytosis  of  GAS  by 
human  PMNs  (Fig.  5B).  These  results  suggest  that  IgG  en-
dopeptidase  activity  of  SeMac  is  critical  for  inhibition  of 
phagocytosis.

SeMac does not Inhibit Opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by 
Horse PMN 

  A  whole  blood  based  phagocytosis  assay  [13,  14]  was 
used  to  test  whether  SeMac  inhibits  opsonophagocytosis  of 
S.  equi  by  horse  PMNs.  The  bacteria  were  labeled  with 
FITC, treated with S. equi-specific horse convalescent serum 
in  the  absence  or  presence  of  SeMac,  and  incubated  with 
horse blood. Percentage of PMNs with phagocytosed S. equi 
was determined by flow cytometry. As expected, percentage 
of  PMNs  with  phagocytosed  S.  equi  with  the  serum  treat-
ment  was  significantly  higher  than  that  for  S.  equi  without 
serum treatment. But the inclusion of SeMac in the assay did 
not affect opsonophagocytosis of S.  equi (Fig. 5A), suggest-

with horse  and human convalescent sera and incubated in the pres-
ence or absence of 100 μg/ml SeMac with 100 μl nonimmune horse 
and  human  blood,  respectively,  at  37°C  for  5,  10  or  20  min.  Red 
blood cells were lysed using an Immunolyse kit, and percentages of 
PMNs  with  phagocytosed  bacteria  determined  by  flow  cytometry 
are presented. 

DISCUSSION 

 
In  this  study  we  describe  that  SeMac  is  a  cysteine  en-
dopeptidase  with  limited  activity  against  horse  IgG  and  is 
unable  to  inhibit  opsonophagocytosis  of  S.  equi  by  horse 
PMNs in a whole blood assay. SeMac efficiently cleaves the 
heavy  chain  of  human  IgG.  The  residues  of  Cys102  and 
His272 are essential and Asp294 important for the enzymatic 
activity of SeMac. Thus, like GAS M1 Mac [7,8], SeMac is 
a  cysteine  endopeptidase.  Although  both  SeMac  and  GAS 
Mac  efficiently  cleave  human  IgG,  they  cannot  cleave  the

majority of total horse IgG. The peptide fragment, PELLGG, 
in  the  lower  hinge  region  is  proposed  to  bind  to  the  active 
site of Mac [9], and the cleavage occurs between the two Gly 
residues  (Table  1).  This  lower  hinge  region  is  not  well  con-
served  in  the  seven  subgroups  of  horse  IgG  [17]  (Table  1). 
Cleavable horse IgG1 has PELLGG, while the non-cleavable 
horse  IgG4  has  PECLSVG  in  the  same  region,  suggesting 
that  the  amino  acid  sequences  of  the  lower  hinge  region  are 
important for cleavability by SeMac and GAS Mac. If this is 
true, horse IgG3 may be also cleavable by SeMac, while the 
other  five  horse  IgG  subgroups  may  not  be  cleaved.  These 
horse  IgG  antibodies  that  cannot  be  cleaved  by  SeMac  thus 
still can mediate the opsonophagocytosis of S. equi. 

 
SeMac and GAS M1 Mac show similar enzymatic speci-
ficity  (Fig.  4  and  Table  1),  confirming  the  previous  finding 
[18].  SeMac  can  cleave  human  IgG  and  inhibit  the  opsono-
phagocytosis  of  GAS  by  human  PMNs,  but  it  has  limited 
enzymatic activity against horse IgG and is unable to inhibit 
opsonophagocytosis  of  S.  equi  by  horse  PMNs.  Thus,  there  
is  a  correlation  between  the  enzymatic  activity  of  SeMac  
and  its  ability  to  inhibit  opsonophagocytosis,  suggesting  
that SeMac functions like GAS M1 Mac in the inhibition of 
opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs. 

  Timoney  et  al.  recently  reported 
that  IdeE/SeMac  
reduces  the  bactericidal  activity  of  isolated  equine  PMNs  
for  S.  equi  [19].  Our  results  suggest  that  the  inhibition  
of the bactericidal activity of PMNs may not be mediated by 
opsonophagocytosis or may be insignificant in whole blood. 

 
SeMac  is  not  produced  in  vitro,  whereas  GAS  Mac  is 
[16].  The  mac  gene  is  controlled  by  the  two-component 
regulatory  system  CovRS  [5],  which  also  controls  the  ex-
pression  of  many  virulence  factors  including  the  hyaluronic 
capsule  [20].  The  hyaluronic  capsule  of  S.  equi  is  highly 

produced in vitro. These observations suggest that the semac 
and  mac  genes  are  regulated  by  different  mechanisms.  This 
suggestion is supported by only 29% DNA sequence identity 
between  S.  equi  and  M1  GAS  in  the  upstream  region  of  the 
semac and mac genes. 

S. equi is a horse pathogen. The fact that SeMac does not 
 
inhibit  opsonophagocytosis  of  S.  equi  by  horse  PMNs  indi-
cates  that  SeMac  is  not  involved  in  the  evasion  of  the  ac-
quired  horse  immunity  against  S.  equi.  This  suggests  that 
SeMac has other unknown function.
