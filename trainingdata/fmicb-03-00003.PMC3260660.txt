Blooms of the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis are common events globally,
and as a result signiﬁcant resources continue to be dedicated to monitoring and con-
trolling these events. Recent studies have shown that a signiﬁcant proportion of total
cell-associated phosphorus (P) in marine phytoplankton can be surface adsorbed; as a
result studies completed to date do not accurately report the P demands of these organ-
isms. In this study we measure the total cell-associated and intracellular P as well as
growth rates of two toxic strains of Microcystis aeruginosa Kütz grown under a range of
P concentrations. The results show that the intracellular P pool in Microcystis represents
a percentage of total cell-associated P (50–90%) similar to what has been reported for
actively growing algae in marine systems. Intracellular P concentrations (39–147 fg cell−1)
generally increased with increasing P concentrations in the growth medium, but growth
rate and the ratio of total cell-associated to intracellular P remained generally stable. Intra-
cellular P quotas and growth rates in cells grown under the different P treatments illustrate
the ability of this organism to successfully respond to changes in ambient P loads, and thus
have implications for ecosystem scale productivity models employing P concentrations to
predict algal bloom events.

INTRODUCTION
Widespread nutrient loading has led to the eutrophication of
aquatic ecosystems throughout the developed world. A primary
concern linked to eutrophication is the appearance of harm-
ful algal blooms (HABs). HAB events are well-documented,
ecosystem-wide problems that can impact human health, kill live-
stock, foul potable water supplies, and compromise the integrity
of both recreational and commercial ﬁsheries (Carmichael, 2001).
HABs have also been implicated in contributing to the formation
of hypoxic zones (Paerl et al., 1998).

Efforts to limit algal bloom formation have historically focused
on reducing nutrient loading. Phosphorus (P) has been suggested
to be the nutrient that limits phytoplankton growth in most fresh-
water ecosystems (Schindler, 1977; Schindler et al., 2008). Reg-
ulating P-loading has led to successes in controlling algal bloom
formation in some eutrophic systems (Makarewicz and Bertram,
1991). This developing understanding of eutrophication has been
critical to the continued development of mathematical environ-
mental models which have become substantially more sophisti-
cated with advances such as coupling hydrodynamic, ecological,
and watershed models (Jørgensen, 2010).

Microcystis spp. are among the most common bloom-forming
cyanobacteria in freshwaters and have a global distribution

(Chorus and Bartram, 1999). The effects of P limitation on P-
uptake in Microcystis have been extensively studied. Like other
cyanobacteria, Microcystis possesses the ability to store excess
P intracellularly, as polyphosphate granules, and P-starved cells
have higher rates of P-uptake than P-sufﬁcient cells (Jacobson
and Halmann, 1982). Microcystis has been shown to respond to
P limitation by rapid P-uptake with a notable increase in V max
observed under P-limiting conditions (Kromkamp et al., 1989).
The recently sequenced Microcystis genomes indicate the presence
of ATP driven P-uptake systems similar to what has been described
in Synechococcus (Ritchie et al., 1997, 2001; Kaneko et al., 2007;
Frangeul et al., 2008).

Recently, an oxalate rinse developed to remove surface adsorbed
iron (Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2003) was shown to also effectively
remove surface adsorbed P from marine plankton (Sãnudo-
Wilhelmy et al., 2004; Fu et al., 2005). Subsequently, these stud-
ies have shown a signiﬁcant proportion (15–45%) of total cell-
associated P to be surface adsorbed in marine cyanobacteria, and
that this P is likely associated with surface adsorbed manganese.
These studies have also suggested surface adsorption of P may
be part of a two-step process in which surface adsorption is fol-
lowed by internalization. Arguably, this phenomenon, if universal
in nature, is predicted to be of even greater relevance to freshwater

ecosystems given their more universal P-limited nature. A conse-
quence of the presence of adsorbed P on the surface of phytoplank-
ton is that previous estimates of cyanobacterial P requirements
may overstate the need for this nutrient. Alternatively, the ability
of cyanobacteria to store P on their exterior surface may act as a
novel strategy to allow persistence during periods of prolonged P
deﬁciency (or to survive “boom-and-bust” cycles of nutrient avail-
ability). As such, a necessary ﬁrst step is to determine the ability of
cells to accumulate extracellular P and, further, to determine the
contribution of this pool to estimated total P quotas.

In this study we determined the total cell-associated and intra-
cellular P quotas and growth rates of two toxic Microcystis strains
grown under a series of P concentrations. We similarly examined
the ratio of total cell associated to intracellular P of natural com-
munities in the western basin of Lake Erie where Microcystis forms
an important part of the endemic plankton assemblage. Establish-
ing accurate P quotas (and their plasticity) for this potentially
toxic bloom-forming cyanobacterium is a necessary step toward
the development of realistic environmental phytoplankton growth
models and management strategies for many important freshwater
resources.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CYANOBACTERIAL CULTURE CONDITIONS
Experiments were performed with M. aeruginosa PCC 7806
obtained from the Pasteur Culture Collection. While M. aerugi-
nosa PCC 7806 is a globally used type strain, it is not representative
of much of the observed Microcystis diversity in Lake Erie (Ouel-
lette and Wilhelm, 2003; Ouellette et al., 2006; Ye et al., 2009). M.
aeruginosa LE3, an isolate from Lake Erie (Brittain et al., 2000),
was also included as it has been shown to be representative of
Lake Erie Microcystis (e.g., Rinta-Kanto and Wilhelm, 2006) and
has been used as a standard in numerous studies (e.g., Rinta-
Kanto et al., 2009b). Cultures were maintained in BG-11 medium

−2 s

(Rippka et al., 1979) at pH 7.5 with P concentrations ranging
from 1.75 to 175 μM K2HPO4. Cultures were grown in 50 mL
glass culture tubes (Kimble, Vineland, NJ, USA) at 24˚C under
−1. Prior to
continuous illumination of ∼30 μmol photons m
use, all culture tubes were soaked overnight in 1% HCl and rinsed
multiple times with Milli-Q® water (Millipore Corp., Billerica,
MA, USA). Samples were grown and transferred at experimen-
tal P concentrations two times prior to data collection. Multiple
transfers were performed to ensure the stabilization of cellular P
stores and the physiological equilibration of cell cultures to exper-
imental P levels vis a vis Wilhelm et al. (1996). Cyanobacterial
growth was monitored daily using a Turner Designs TD-700 ﬂuo-
rometer (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) equipped with an in vivo chla ﬁlter
set (excitation λ= 340–500 nm; emission λ= >665 nm). Growth
rates were determined through the measurement of the slope of
the growth curve during the exponential growth phase plotted
as the natural log. All experiments were performed in triplicate
unless otherwise noted.

FIELD SAMPLE COLLECTION
Field samples were collected at sites across Lake Erie (Table 1)
between the dates of August 3 and 7, 2010 aboard the CCGS Lim-
nos. Surface water was collected at each site using 10 L Niskin
sampling bottles and subsequently stored in 3 L opaque amber
polycarbonate bottles until ﬁltration (with the time between
collection and storage less than 1 h).

PHYTOPLANKTON ENUMERATION
Phytoplankton enumeration was performed using samples pre-
served in Lugol’s Iodine as previously described (Rodhe et al.,
1958; Anderson, 2005). Fifty milliliter samples from each incuba-
tion were collected and immediately distributed into amber bottles
with predispensed Lugol’s Iodine resulting in a ﬁnal concentration
of 2% (vol/vol) ﬁxative. Fixed samples were enumerated using a

Plasticity in Microcystis cellular P

Sedgwick-Rafter counting slide (Wildco) on a Micromaster light
microscope (ThermoFisher). Samples were allowed to settle in the
counting chamber for 3–5 min prior to enumeration. Four hori-
zontal passes were made across each slide encompassing the full
height and width of the slide; no fewer than 40 ﬁelds of view were
randomly selected across each slide. Each ﬁeld of view was imaged
and saved using Micron imaging software (Westover Scientiﬁc);
the use of this software allowed for the measurement of the ﬁeld
of view.

QUANTIFICATION OF TOTAL CELLULAR AND INTRACELLULAR P
Total cellular and intracellular P concentrations were indepen-
dently measured. Surface bound P was removed using an oxalate
wash reagent initially designed for removal of iron (Tovar-Sanchez
et al., 2003) and subsequently demonstrated to be applicable
for removal of surface-sorbed P (Sãnudo-Wilhelmy et al., 2004).
Aliquots of 5 mL from individual cultures and 50–200 mL from
ﬁeld samples were harvested onto pre-combusted (450˚C for 4 h)
25 mm Whatman (Kent, UK) GF/F glass ﬁber ﬁlters for the deter-
mination of total P in samples. The range in sample volumes
collected at the individual sites was to account for different phyto-
plankton concentrations at each station. For the determination of
intracellular P from Microcystis isolates, aliquots were ﬁrst mixed
with an equal volume of oxalate wash and allowed to incubate for
5 min prior to harvest. Field samples were ﬁltered until approxi-
mately 5 mL of sample water remained in the ﬁlter unit; 5 mL of
oxalate rinse was then applied and incubated for 5 min. A top-up
solution containing equal parts oxalate rinse and ﬁltered lakewater
was applied as needed to counter losses due to residual vacuum.
Following this incubation, the ﬁlter was rinsed three times with
5 mL of P-free growth media or ﬁltered lake water. To control for
the removal of surface associated P during the washing process,
control samples were rinsed with P-free medium or ﬁltered lake
water four times in the same manner as experimental samples.
Unused growth medium of each of the experimental P concentra-
tions was passed through ﬁlters and rinsed with P-free media and
oxalate rinse solution as blanks to control for media associated
P binding to the ﬁlter. Filtered station water was used as blanks
for ﬁeld samples. All treatments were performed in triplicate and
blanks were performed in duplicate. Following the oxalate rinse
procedure, ﬁlters were stored at −20˚C until analysis.

P MEASUREMENT
Particulate organic P was collected on ﬁlters and converted to inor-
ganic P via persulfate oxidation (Menzel and Corwin, 1965; Wetzel
and Likens, 2000). Freshly made 5% potassium persulfate solution
was added to samples that were then placed in a boiling water
bath for 1 h. Total P concentrations were measured spectropho-
tometrically (885 nm) using the ammonium molybdate method
(Wetzel and Likens, 2000). All measurements for ﬁeld samples
were performed on a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 20 spectropho-
tometer (ThermoFisher Waltham, MA, USA), whereas cultured
samples were processed using a Biomate 5 spectrophotometer
(ThermoFisher Waltham, MA, USA).

Field samples were prepared by ﬁrst digesting with 5% potas-
sium persulfate, followed by autoclaving for 30 min. Total P was
spectrophotometrically analyzed (880 nm) with the molybdate

ascorbic acid method (Strickland and Parsons, 1972) using a
10-cm quartz cell and a Cary 50 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Var-
ian Palo Alto, CA, USA). A calibration was conducted using phos-
phate reference standards of known concentration processed in
the same manner as sample material. Individual replicates were
omitted from ﬁeld sample analysis if one sample was more than
100% different than the average of the two other samples. Variabil-
ity among replicates was likely the result of the incomplete rinsing
of cell aggregates.

Subsamples of cultured samples (1.5 mL) were also collected
from each tube for direct counts of cell concentration. Microcys-
tis cell densities were determined by epiﬂuorescence microscopy
with a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) DMXRA epiﬂuorescence micro-
scope using the Texas Red ﬁlter set targeting accessory pigment
(phycobillin) autoﬂuorescence as previously described (Wilhelm
et al., 2006). This was performed to normalize P measurements to
Microcystis cell abundance.

in 90% acetone overnight at −20˚C using a Turner Designs 10-AU

RESULTS
P-CONSTRAINTS ON MICROCYSTIS GROWTH
Cultured Microcystis growth rates across a range of P concentra-
tions are shown in Table 2. Growth rates in both strains were only
slightly variable across the tested experimental P concentrations.

with a slope of 0.0002 in M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 while M. aerug-
inosa LE3 rates decreased with a slope of −0.0001. Growth rates
were especially steady among those cultures maintained at higher
P concentrations. Growth rates were more variable in M. aerugi-
nosa LE3 than in M. aeruginosa PCC 7806. Although growth rates
were stable across concentrations of P, biomass was notably lower
in cultures maintained under the lower P concentrations (results
not shown). It should also be noted that Microcystis PCC 7806
did not grow consistently at the lowest P concentrations in spite
of repeated attempts. We recognize that the reported growth rates
are lower than published values. These lower growth rates are the
result of the cultures being grown in conditions not optimized to

values (39–173 fg cell
marine cyanobacteria (Fu et al., 2005), our results show that sur-
face adsorbed P represents a signiﬁcant portion (between 10 and
50%) of total cell-associated P in Microcystis. We also found that
this percentage is stable across growth conditions in each of the
strains tested (Figure 1C).

TOTAL CELL-ASSOCIATED AND INTRACELLULAR P IN NATURAL
SAMPLES
The ratio of total cell-associated P to intracellular P was also
investigated in natural phytoplankton communities. Samples were
collected across Lake Erie with speciﬁc emphasis on the Western
Basin. This sampling focus reﬂects the recurrence of Microcystis
blooms in this region (Rinta-Kanto et al., 2005, 2009a; Moorhead
et al., 2008). Microcystis spp. was present at all tested stations,
though a diverse assemblage of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae
were observed (Table A1 in Appendix). Hydrological and biolog-
ical parameters measured as part of this study were similar to
those previously reported across Lake Erie (Table 2; DeBruyn et al.,
2004). Intracellular P made up an average of 89% (±11%) with a
range of 0–65% of total particulate P in these samples (Table 1).

Pearson correlation analysis of Western Basin samples showed
weakly signiﬁcant correlations (p < 0.1) between the proportion
of surface associated extracellular P and several environmental
variables, including SRP, POC, PON, and SiO2 (Table 3). Notably,
no signiﬁcant correlation was observed between the proportion of
extracellular P and either TP or TDP (Table 3; Figure 2).

DISCUSSION
A general tenet of limnology is that P is the nutrient limiting
phytoplankton biomass in many freshwater systems and that, by
reducing P loading to eutrophic bodies of water, we can begin
to control formation of algal blooms and biomass accumulation
(Schindler et al., 2008). While the previous statement is a com-
monly held assumption (although not always true, e.g., Scott and
McCarthy, 2010; Wilhelm et al., 2011), it is important to note that
individual HAB organisms have speciﬁc nutrient needs and differ
in their abilities to assimilate nutrients from different chemical
species. For example, it is now well established that some freshwa-
ter cyanobacteria possess the capacity to assimilate P from complex
organic sources, such as phosphonates (Ilikchyan et al., 2009; Sax-
ton et al., 2011). Moreover, the addition of organic sources of
nutrient have been shown to inﬂuence phytoplankton community
structure in bioassays performed using natural assemblages (Wang
et al., 2010). To this end, we examined the P requirements of one
of the most prominent bloom-forming cyanobacteria, M. aerug-
inosa, so as to develop a dynamic cellular quota that can be used
to inform credible data reporting. To do so, we applied recently
developed techniques that allow for the individual analysis of total
cell-associated vs. intracellular P pools in phytoplankton.

Our results show plasticity in both cellular and surface absorbed
P quotas. The ability to adjust intracellular P levels while main-
taining a stable growth rate across a range of P concentrations is
important for bloom-forming cyanobacteria as it allows for per-
sistence in conditions that do not allow for the accumulation of
signiﬁcant biomass. This nutritional ﬂexibility is important for
microbes in environments that experience large nutrient variabil-
ity, such as large lakes and estuarine systems. The plasticity of
cellular P quotas is in contrast to the stability of the total cell-
associated P to intracellular P ratio. Our data show this ratio to be
stable, demonstrating an ability of Microcystis to adjust its P needs.
These observations imply that surface associated P is a function
of the external concentration in the environment. One potential
route for P adjustment has been described in marine cyanobacteria
that substitute phospholipids for nitrogen and sulfur containing

lipids in response to P limitation (Van Mooy et al., 2009), though
this ability has not yet been described in Microcystis. Observed
variability in P quota values in the tested strains is likely attrib-
utable to variance between strains. This variance is also observed
in genetic differences between the sequenced Microcystis strains
(Kaneko et al., 2007; Frangeul et al., 2008).

In contrast to our observations in cultured Microcystis, the ratio
of intracellular to extracellular P was not constant between Lake
Erie stations.

Plasticity in Microcystis cellular P

Whereas this variability is correlated to differences in ambi-
ent SRP concentrations, dissimilarity in plankton communities
between these sites may also contribute. The high proportion
of intracellular P as compared to the total P pool in Lake Erie
is indicative of an actively growing phytoplankton community
(Sãnudo-Wilhelmy et al., 2004). Another factor inﬂuencing the
intracellular-total P ratio in natural Microcystis populations may
be colony morphology. If exposure to dissolved phosphate is a
driver of the presence of extracellular P, as is suggested by the pos-
itive correlation between SRP and the percentage of extracellular
P, then the cellular surfaces not exposed to the environment will
not have externally bound P.

Unfortunately the fate of stored P on the cell surface remains
elusive; it is possible that when cells are shifted from P-replete
to P-limiting conditions, this surface associated material can be
assimilated by cells as opposed to the alternative of this P being
lost back to the environment as has been previously hypothesized
(Sãnudo-Wilhelmy et al., 2004). While the hypothesis that sur-
face adsorbed P is available to phytoplankton is intriguing, we
observed no evidence to suggest that it is the case in Microcystis.
Were this true we would expect the ratio of surface-intracellular
P to shift toward the intracellular fraction under conditions of
P stress as the cells scavenged P from the surface. However, we
observed this ratio to remain constant across the growth condi-
tions tested in this study. This observation paired with the positive
correlation between SRP and surface adsorbed P in our Lake Erie
samples suggests that the presence of P on the surface of these cells
is a by-product of living in an environment where dissolved P is
present.

Models of eutrophication and phytoplankton growth remain
a critical tool for systems managers attempting to control fre-
quent bloom formation and have been applied to Lake Erie since
the middle of the twentieth century (Di Toro et al., 1975; Léon
et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2008; Schwab et al., 2009). Microcys-
tis growth has been speciﬁcally targeted in many models because
it is a problematic, bloom-forming cyanobacterium. Physiologi-
cal parameters, such as cellular nutrient quotas, nutrient uptake
rates and cellular growth rates, are integral to generating accurate
predictions of cellular growth and toxin production under speciﬁc
environmental conditions. Cellular P quota is a variable used (or is
integral to variables used) in environmental models that have been
applied to both Microcystis and Lake Erie (Robson and Hamilton,
2004; Léon et al., 2011; Burger et al., 2008; Trolle et al., 2008). This
use of P quota as a modeling variable coupled with the fact that

literature P quotas in Microcystis do not take into account the pres-
ence of externally bound P hinders the ability of these models to
accurately project the occurrence of blooms and underestimates
the algal biomass that can be supported by current P inputs. For
example, the minimum internal p value applied to the CAEDYM
−1
model by Robson and Hamilton (2004) of 0.4 mg P (mg chla)
represents approximately a 40× overestimation of the P needs of
this organism compared to the values reported here. The accu-
rate prediction of natural conditions by environmental models
is dependent on the use of precisely measured variables, so it is
critical that the modeling community use the most appropriate
values. Moreover, the signiﬁcant metabolic plasticity with respect
to P quotas demonstrated by Microcystis in the present study is
also not taken into account in current models. The current math-
ematical models use one or two values, often the minimum and
maximum, to describe biological parameters such as growth rate
or internal P quota (to limit the complexity of already complex
models). Microcystis, however, has the ability to adapt to envi-
ronmental challenge. As such, the ability of new hydrodynamic
models, such as ELCOM, to more effectively describe changing
physical conditions and nutrient concentrations in the water col-
umn suggest biological models would beneﬁt from incorporating
a more complex view of cyanobacterial growth over nutrient and
temperature gradients.

The importance of controlling the growth of HAB cyanobac-
teria cannot be understated because of the water quality effects
in both undeveloped and industrial countries. Previous stud-
ies examining P quotas in Microcystis measured only the total
cell-associated P pool. In this study we differentiate between
the total cell-associated P pools, including surface bound P, and
the intracellular P pool; thus the P quotas reported here are a
more representative examination of the P needs of Microcystis
than has been previously reported. These results will be useful to
resource managers attempting to model and control this nuisance
alga.
