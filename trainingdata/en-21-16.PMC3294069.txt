Chronic behavioral stress is a risk factor for depression. To understand chronic stress eff ects and the mechanism underlying stress-
induced emotional changes, various animals model have been developed. We recently reported that mice treated with restraints 
for 2 h daily for 14 consecutive days (2h-14d or 2h×14d) show lasting depression-like behavior. Restraint provokes emotional 
stress in the body, but the nature of stress induced by restraints is presumably more complex than emotional stress. So a question 
remains unsolved whether a similar procedure with “emotional” stress is suffi  cient to cause depression-like behavior. To address 
this, we examined whether “emotional” constraints in mice treated for 2h×14d by enforcing them to individually stand on a small 
stepping platform placed in a water bucket with a quarter full of water, and the stress evoked by this procedure was termed “water-
bucket stress”. Th  e water-bucket stress activated the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) system in a manner similar to 
restraint as evidenced by elevation of serum glucocorticoids. Aft er the 2h×14d water-bucket stress, mice showed behavioral changes 
that were attributed to depression-like behavior, which was stably detected >3 weeks after last water-bucket stress endorsement. 
Administration of the anti-depressant, imipramine, for 20 days from time aft er the last emotional constraint completely reversed 
the stress-induced depression-like behavior. Th  ese results suggest that emotional stress evokes for 2h×14d in mice stably induces 
depression-like behavior in mice, as does the 2h×14d restraint.

INTRODUCTION

Depression is a prevailing form of psychiatric illness worldwide, 
but the underlying mechanism is not clearly elaborated. Recent 
progresses in the establishment of depression animal models give 
us a hope to unravel the molecular mechanism of depression and 
to develop advanced anti-depression strategies [1, 2]. Mice or rats

exposed to a variety of stressors over a prolonged period display 
behavioral changes that parallel depression-like symptoms, such as 
decreased social interaction, decreased intake of sucrose, increased 
immobility time in helpless conditions such as in the forced swim 
test and tail suspension test [3-5]. Th  ese stress-induced behavioral 
changes are generally reversed by chronic, but not acute, treatment 
with antidepressant drugs, such as imipramine or fluoxetine [4, 
6], supporting the usefulness of stress-induced animal models in 
depression studies. 
Regarding animals models, various stressors are delivered 
repeatedly or continuously in mice or rats for a certain period of 
time to recapitulate depression pathophysiology in human. Among

rodent models induced by “continuous” behavioral constraints 
are the chronic mild stress (CMS) model [3], chronic social defeat 
stress [4] and prolonged isolation stress [7], while among animal 
models induced by “repeated” constraints are animal models with 
repeated restraints [8-10]. Each of these models, including others, 
may have their own features. However, any specific model does 
not have all advantages over others. For examples, the social defeat 
stress model introduced by Berton et al. [4] have subject animals 
experience an off ensive aggression physically for 10 min and then 
emotionally and contextually through olfactory, auditory and 
visual stimuli by placing mice in a close proximity for the rest of 
the day and this procedure was repeated for consecutive 10 days. 
The social defeat stress model produced by this experimental 
procedure has a feature to provide highly robust depression-like 
behavioral phenotypes and molecular changes [4, 11, 12], whereas 
this model requires a stable provision of proper off ensive animals, 
for example aged CD1 mice [4, 11, 13]. Given the criticism that 
the 10-d continuous stress exposure in the chronic social defeat 
stress model might be too severe, “repeated” social defeat stress 
paradigms have been used [14-16]. Depression-like behavioral 
phenotypes can be also induced in animal models treated with 
repeated stress, such as with 2h×10d [17], 2h×14d restraint [10], 
or 6h×21d restraint [18, 19]. Repeated restraints have a superior 
feasibility in handling experimental procedures compared to other 
models, although the concept of eff ective doses of stress threshold 
and optimized stress strength have not been established. 
Among many questions remained to be solved, it is a challenging 
question to know whether depression-related behavioral changes 
can be stably produced in animals aft er what extents of “emotional” 
stressor are repeatedly treated. Th  erefore, in the present study, we 
examined whether lasting depression-related behavioral changes 
is produced by exposing mice to emotional stressor repeatedly for 
2h×14d. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals 
Male C57BL/6 mice at 7 weeks of age were purchased from 
Daehan BioLink, Inc. (Eumsung, Chungbuk, Korea). They were 
housed in pair in clear plastic cages at a temperature (22~23oC)- 
and humidity (50~60%)-controlled environment with a 12 hour-
light/dark cycle (light on at 7 a.m.) and were allowed to lab chow 
and water freely. Th  ey were adapted to the new environment for 1 
week before use in experiments. 

Treatment of water-bucket stress 
To deliver water-bucket stress, 8-week-old mice weighting 

Emotional Stress-induced Depression Model

-22~23 g at 8 weeks of age were placed on a small stepping round 
platform (3.5 cm diameter) in a bucket (42 cm diameter x 55 
cm height) with a quarter full of water. The depth of water was 
17.5 cm, and the platform was elevated 1 cm above the water 
surface (Fig. 1A). The water-bucket stressor was delivered to 
animals for 1~3 h daily from 10 A.M. for 14 days on a scheduled 
procedure. Control mice were placed in pair in their original cages 
undisturbed at home environment. After each session of water-
bucket stress, animals were returned to their home environment 
by housing them in pair in normal plastic cages with free access to 
food and water. Imipramine was intraperitoneally injected each 
day at indicated schedule. Animals were handled in accordance

ANOVA followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple range test. All 
data were presented as the means±S.E.M. and statistical diff erence 
was accepted at the 5% level unless otherwise indicated. 

Corticosterone measurement
Blood was collected from the heart of sacrifi ced mice at indicated 
time points in all cases, and centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min 
to obtain serum. Plasma corticosterone levels were assessed 
using a competitive enzyme immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, 
Minneapolis, MN, USA) as recently described [20]. 

Behavioral assessments
Behavioral assessments were carried out using a computerized 
video-tracking system, SMART (Panlab S.I., Barcelona, Spain) as 
previously described [10]. The mice were all placed in the same 
environment 30 min prior to the behavioral tests. Behavioral 
analyses were performed by following the sequences indicated. 
The elevated plus maze (EPM) test: The EPM apparatus 
consisted of four arms (30×7 cm each) made of white Foamex, 
which was elevated 50 cm above the floor and placed at right 
angles to each other. Two of the arms had 20 cm high walls 
(enclosed arms), while the other two had no walls (open arms). 
For the EPM test, each mouse was initially placed at the center of 
the platform and left  to explore the arms for 5 min. Th  e number of 
entries into the open and enclosed arms and the time spent in each 
arm were recorded. Entry into each arm was scored as an event if 
the animal placed all paws into the corresponding arm. 
Th  e open fi eld test (OFT): Locomotor activity was measured 
in the open field made of a white Foamex chamber (45×45×40 
cm). Each mouse was placed individually at the center of the open 
fi eld, and the locomotion was recorded for the indicated period. 
Th  e horizontal locomotor activity was judged by the distance the 
animal moved. 
The tail suspension test (TST): Mice were individually 
suspended 50 cm above the fl oor by the tail using an adhesive tape 
(approximately 1 cm from the tip of the tail) for 6 min. Immobility 
time during the last 5 min was recorded. 
Th  e forced swim test (FST): Mice were placed in a transparent 
Plexiglas cylinder (height: 27 cm, diameter: 15 cm) containing 
water at a temperature of 22~23oC and a depth of 15 cm so that 
they could not escape and could not touch the bottom. Mice were 
placed for 6 min in the water-fi lled cylinder and immobility time 
during the last 5 min was recorded. Immobility time was the total 
duration of animals remained fl oating with all limbs motionless. 

Statistical analysis
Two-sample comparisons were carried out using the Student 
t-test, and multiple comparisons were made using one-way 

RESULTS 

A new depression model induced by emotional stress
Subject mice were individually enforced to stand on a small 
stepping platform (3.5 cm in diameter) placed in the middle 
of a bucket with a quarter full of water (Fig. 1A) and thereby 
to confront with potential drowning stress and isolation stress 
for hour(s). The emotional stress evoked by this procedure was 
termed “water-bucket” (or “small-island”) stress. 
Mice (C57BL/6, 7-weeks old, male) treated with water-bucket 
stress for 1 or 2 h daily tended to weigh slightly more than the 
control for the first 1~3 days. Thereafter they gradually weighed 
less than the control mice until day 14. Thus, mice with water-
bucket stress showed body weight changes in a reverse S-shape 
pattern over time (Fig. 1B), which is sharply contrast to that 
induced by a restraint [10]. Mice treated with 1 or 2 h of water-
bucket stress ate more food than the control during the initial 1~3 
days, and this tendency, though weaken thereaft er, was continued 
to the end of the recording (Fig. 1C). Mice treated with 1 or 2 h of 
water-bucket stress took more water than the control during the 
stress period, but their water intake returned to the control level 
aft er stress (Fig. 1D).

Corticosterone levels
The water-bucket stress increased plasma corticosterone levels 
with ~400 ng/ml of the peak value reached ~60 min aft er the start 
of stressor exposure (Fig. 2A), indicating that the water-bucket 
stress potently activates the HPA axis, but its activation level is 
slightly weaker than that induced by the 2-h restraint [10]. Aft er 
the cessation of water-bucket stress, enhanced corticosterone 
levels slowly returned downwards to the baseline (Fig. 2A). When 
this daily 2-h water-bucket stress was reapplied for next days, 
plasma corticosterone levels at the end of each stress session were 
gradually declined (Fig. 2B). 

Repeated (2h×14d) emotional stress induced anxiety-and 
depression-like behavior
Next, we examined whether repeated water-bucket stress induces 
behavioral changes. In the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, mice 
treated with water-bucket stress for 2h×14d, but not for 1h×14d, 
showed lesser percentages of entries and time spent in the open 
arm than the control mice (Fig. 3A~C). In the open field test, 
however, the locomotor activities of mice in all stressed groups

were comparable to the non-stressed control mice (Fig. 3D). In 
the forced swim test (FST) which was performed 2 weeks aft er the 
last stress session (Fig. 3A), mice treated with water-bucket stress 
for 2h×14d or 1h×14d showed a signifi cant increase in immobility 
time (Fig. 3E). We observed that depression-like behavior in the 
FST was detected a month aft er the last stressor exposure (data not 
shown).

The depression-like behavior induced by the 2h×14d 
emotional stress lasted for more than 3 weeks
Next, we examined whether depression-like behavior induced 
by 2h×14d water-bucket stress was robustly persisted for 3 weeks 
and whether treatment of stress-mice with the anti-depressant, 
imipramine, for 3 weeks, gave anti-depression eff ects. Th  e forced 
swim tests performed on post-stress day 21 (3 weeks after the 
last stressor exposure) revealed that mice with water-bucket 
stress showed enhanced immobility time in the TST (Fig. 4A, 
B). Similarly, the FST performed on post-stress day 22 showed 
that the 2h×14d stress mice displayed enhanced immobility 
time (Fig. 4C). In contrast, administration of imipramine in the 
2h×14d stress-mice for 21~22 days from post-stress day 1 reversed 
depression-like phenotype in the TST and FST (Fig. 4A~C). Th  ese 
results suggest that 2h×14d water-bucket stress produces long-
lasting changes in depression-related behavior. 

DISCUSSION 

Th  e present study demonstrates that emotional stress evoked by 
placing mice individually to stand on confined small island in a 
bucket with a quarter full of water (so named water-bucket stress) 
for 2 h daily for 14 consecutive days (2h×14d) eff ectively produced

a lasting change in depression-related behavior. This behavioral 
alteration was rescued by treatment with imipramine for 14~21 
days of post-stress. We recently reported that restraint stress 
treated for 2 h daily for 14 days stably produced lasting changes in 
depression-like behavior [10]. Similar to the result of the previous 
study, the 2h×14d water-bucket stress activated the HPA axis and 
evoked anxiety- and depression-like behavioral responses. Th  ough 
this 2h×14d water-bucket stress model should be strengthened 
by further characterization in the future, this model has a few 
attractive features as described below.

of relatively mild stress, but this 2h×14d stress stably produces 
relatively long-lasting changes in depression-related behavior. Th  e 
water-bucket increased plasma corticostrone level rapidly (Fig. 2), 
but the peak level was slightly lower than that induced by restraint 
and time-dependent decline upon repeated stress was also milder 
than that induced by restraint [10], suggesting that water-bucket 
stress activates HPA axis slightly milder than restraint stress does. 
Th  e time-dependent decline in plasma corticostrone levels implies 
that the feedback-loop actively worked out in the body, but its 
requirement in the 2h×14d water-bucket stress model was less 
strongly active. Concerning the chronic social defeat stress model 
introduced by Berton et al. [4], it was produced by a continuous 
10-days stress exposure, which consisted of daily 10-min defeat 
stress followed by enforcing subject mice to closely stay with 
an aggressor for the remainder of the day. Regarding isolation 
stress model, mice exposed to isolation stress for 3 months show 
anxiety- and anhedonia-like symptoms [7]. Isolation stress is a 
chronic mild stress, but the experimental procedure takes too 
long or require big patient to repeat in a regular laboratory. While 
the chronic mild stress (so called CMS) is given by multiple 
combinations of various unpredictable stressors within the CMS 
schedule [3, 29]. For examples, mice or rats are exposed to 85 dB 
noise for 3 h, water deprivation for 20 h, 45 degree cage tilting, wet 
cage-floor, repeated cold stress (4oC), empty cage, cage shaking, 
light-on for all day, and/or low intensity stroboscopic illumination 
(300 flashes/min) for 9 h, are combinatorially and continuously 
administered for a period of 4~8 weeks. Th  ese stressors as a whole 
appear not to be milder compared to isolation stress and water-
bucket stress, although the total strength of stress among diff erent 
models might be diffi  cult to compare precisely, particularly when 
stress expose is prolonged. 
Third, the 2h×14d water-bucket stress paradigm produces 
depression-like behavior which is long-lasting. Clinically used 
antidepressants usually need to be treated for 1~3 weeks to 
obtain antidepressant eff ects [33, 34]. Recent studies suggest that 
depression is produced by epigenetic, biochemical and structural 
alterations in the brain [4, 11 12, 35] Because the 2h×14d water-
bucket stress model is developed to have a window of more than 
3 weeks from the day aft er the last stress session until behavioral 
tests, this model permits an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy 
of potential anti-depressants and their underlying mechanisms. 
Moreover, the 2h×14d water-bucket stress paradigm produces 
long-lasting behavioral changes, which will help us unravel the 
mechanisms underlying depression and develop novel strategies 
for anti-depression. 
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the 2h×14d 
water-bucket stress, though mild and emotional, causes a lasting 

Fig. 4. Depression-like behavior induced by the 2h×14d water-bucket 
stress was reversed by post-treatment with imipramine. (A) Experimental 
schedule of stress treatment, anti-depressant treatment, and behavioral 
tests. Imipramine was treated at the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (i.p.) from the 
post-stress day 1 (from the next day aft er the completion of 2h-14d water-
bucket stress) for 21~22 days. (B, C) Imipramine treatment reduced the 
immobility in the tail suspension test (TS: B) and the forced swim test (FS; 
C), which were performed on post-stress-day 21 and 22, respectively. Th  e 
data are presented as means±S.E.M. (n=16~28). * and ** denote diff erence 
between the indicated groups, at p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively.

First, the 2h×14d water-bucket depression model is based on 
very emotional stress. Among depression models developed 
on the basis of emotional stress or emotional stress-related are 
prey-predator conflict stress model [21-23], territorial conflict 
stress model [24-26], isolation stress [7], conditioned emotional 
stress (CES) model [27, 28], chronic mild stress (CMS) model 
[3, 29], social defeat stress models [4, 30-32], and restraint stress 
model [8, 9]. To induce depression-like behavioral changes, 
intended stressor(s) in these models was delivered to subject 
animals repeatedly or chronically, from days to weeks to months 
depending models. Because applied stressors and stressor-
treatment procedures in these models have their own unique 
features, the outcome of the behavioral changes and molecular 
and biochemical changes in the brain might have some distinct 
features. In particular, because sources of stressors used in these 
models are varied, the neural system responding to various 
perceptual modalities might be complexly impinged. In the water-
bucket stress model, stressor modality is relatively simple and 
very emotional. In addition, a stable induction of depression-
like behavior was provoked by the defi ned procedure, and its tied 
behavioral correction by treatment with imipramine supports 
for the usefulness of the 2h×14d stress paradigm to generate a 
depression model in mice. Future studies to reveal associated 
neural circuit for evoking emotional stress will be achieved using 
this model.
Second, the 2h×14d water-bucket stress procedure is composed

the 2h×14d restraint. Moreover, the present study demonstrated 
that repeated water-bucket stress model can be used to test of the 
effi  cacy of potential anti-depression drugs.
