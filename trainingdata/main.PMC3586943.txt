The identiﬁcation of common signatures between ageing and cancer can reveal shared molecular mechanisms underlying them.
In this study, we collected ageing-related gene signatures from ten pub- lished studies involved in six diﬀerent human tissues and an online resource.
We found that most of these gene signatures were tissue- speciﬁc and a few were related to multiple tissues.
We performed a genome-wide examination of the expression of these signatures in various human tumor types, and found that a large proportion of these signatures were universally diﬀerentially expressed among normal vs. tumor phenotypes.
Functional analyses of the highly-overlapping genes between ageing and cancer using DAVID tools have iden- tiﬁed important functional categories and pathways linking ageing with cancer.
The convergent and divergent mechanisms between age- ing and cancer are discussed.
This study provides insights into the biology of ageing and cancer, suggesting the possibility of potential interventions aimed at postponing ageing and preventing cancer.
Keywords: Microarray  Gene expression proﬁling  Ageing-related signatures  Tumor  Bioinformatics  Introduction  Ageing is characterized by the gradual decline of the func- tions of molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organisms.
The use of microarray technology to analyze gene expression changes in ageing tissues is a powerful tool for identifying biomarkers of ageing.
Several groups have performed gen- ome-wide analyses of transcriptional proﬁling of ageing in some human tissues including brain [1 3], eye [4 7], kidney [8,9], muscle [10 12], skin [13] and blood [14,15], and sev- eral sets of tissue-speciﬁc signatures of aging were marked.
Magalhaes et al.
performed a meta-analysis of ageing- related gene expression proﬁles using 27 datasets from mice, rats and humans and identiﬁed several common signatures of aging [16].
McCarroll et al.
systematically compared gene expression patterns across organisms and identiﬁed shared transcriptional proﬁles of ageing [17].

These studies have revealed that ageing and ageing-related diseases have been associated with genetic and genomic changes.
Ageing is the greatest risk factor for cancer as cancer incidence rises exponentially with age [18].
Therefore, uncovering the molecular links between ageing and cancer will be of great signiﬁcance in preventing and treating cancer.
Accumulated evidence has shown that ageing and carcinogenesis share some key molecular mechanisms such as telomerase activity [19 21], p53-mediated transcriptional programming [22 24], mitochondrial DNA mutation [25  27], FOXO transcriptional regulation [28 30] and stem cell turnover [31 33], etc.
A genome-wide examination of the expression of ageing- related signatures in tumors will deepen our understanding of the association between ageing and cancer.
However, to our knowledge, no such study has been carried out.
In this study, we investigate the association between ageing and cancer by an extensive examination of the expression of ageing-related genes in various human tumor types.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2012.01.001   Wang X / Expression of Ageing-related Signatures in Tumors  137  results provide insights into the common biology of ageing and cancer.
Results  Human ageing-related genes  We identiﬁed 3359 ageing-related genes in human based on 10 relevant publications (Table 1 and Table S1).
We termed these 3359 genes as ageing-related gene set (AGS).
The complete gene list of AGS along with their occurrence fre- quencies in the 10 gene sets (from 10 publications, respec- tively) are presented in Table S2.
Table S2 shows that six genes, including ANP32B, CA4, WNK1, YWHAZ, ZCCHC24 and ZEB2, have four occur- rences, and 63 genes have three occurrences among the 10 gene sets.
Some genes like ZEB2 are related to multiple tis- sues, suggesting that they are common signatures of ageing.
Here we termed these 69 genes (with P3 occurrences) as the common ageing-related signature gene set (CASGS), which may be signatures of ageing shared by multiple tis- sues.
However, 2887 (86%) genes occurred only in one out of the 10 gene sets, suggesting that a large majority of ageing-related genes are tissue-speciﬁc.
This is in line with the notion proposed by Zahn et al.
[12].
For the CASGS, we carried out functional analysis using DAVID tools [34,35].
The functional annotation chart for pathways showed two important CASGS-related KEGG pathways: pathways in cancer and the MAPK sig- naling pathway (Table 2).
In addition, the functional anno- tation table for pathways identiﬁed 34 sets of KEGG pathways related to a large portion of genes in CASGS (Table S3).
Among them, the MAPK signaling pathway, pathways in cancer and metabolism-related pathways, were the most frequently identiﬁed pathways, indicative of cer- tain shared mechanisms underlying ageing and cancer.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis identiﬁed 51 GO terms (Table S4) and the ﬁve most frequently identiﬁed GO terms include signaling cascade,  intracellular  fraction,  cell  cytosol, mitochondrion and response to wounding, sug- gesting that oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, apop- tosis and senescence, and DNA damage repair are closely associated with ageing.
In addition, we obtained 261 human ageing-related genes from the Human Ageing Genomic Resources (http://www.genomics.senescence.info/genes/allgenes.php).
We referred these 261 genes as human ageing-related genes (HARG).
There were 84 overlaps between HARG and AGS, including ﬁve overlaps between HARG and CASGS (Table S5).
These ﬁve overlapping genes were YWHAZ, HSPA8, FOS, FOXO1 and TP63, most of which are important signatures of ageing and cancer.
For example, YWHAZ encodes the protein involved in regulating insulin sensitivity, and therefore plays a role in regulation of age- ing by aﬀecting insulin/IGF-1 signaling [36,37].
HSPA8 appears to be associated with both ageing and cancer [38,39].
FOS plays a role in regulating cell proliferation, diﬀerentiation, apoptotic cell death and transformation, and has been associated with ageing and cancer [40].
FOXO1 belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors which are strongly associated with human longevity [41] as well as cancer [42].
TP63 encodes a member of the p53 family of transcription factors, and has been associated with ageing and cancer-related pathology [43,44].
Expression of human ageing-related signatures in tumors  We identiﬁed 28 sets of diﬀerentially expressed genes by the 28 normal vs. tumor phenotypes class comparisons in 25 human tumor gene expression datasets.
We analyzed the overlap between each of the 28 gene sets and each of the three aforementioned human ageing-related gene sets: HARG, AGS and CASGS.
The occurrence frequency and ratio of each human ageing-related gene in the 28 tumor-related gene sets are presented in Table S6, which shows the occurrence frequency is considerably high.
The percentage of genes with P5 occurrences in the tumor- related gene sets is 90%, 81% and 100% for HARG, AGS  Table 1 Human ageing-related gene sets from 10 publications  Tissue  Gene set (Reference)  No.

Some representative highly-overlapping genes between ageing and tumors were also listed in Table 3.
Among them, in addition to the aforementioned YWHAZ, FOS, FOXO1 and TP63, some other genes like APOD [45], IGF1 [46] and FOXM1 [30] also tightly link ageing with cancer.
Gene function enrich- ment analyses (GO) suggested that the highly-overlapping genes are mainly involved in metabolic processes, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, apoptosis, cell prolifer- ation and transcriptional regulation (Table 4).
KEGG pathway analysis for highly-overlapping genes with the DAVID tool identiﬁed several important convergent path- ways between ageing and cancer like MAPK signaling pathway, cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway etc.
(Table 5).
Discussion  Microarray analysis of gene expression proﬁling of ageing tissues and cancer tissues is a powerful approach to discov- ering molecular mechanisms underlying ageing and cancer.
Revealing the common molecular signatures between age- ing and cancer may aid humans to extend their life-span by protecting against ageing and cancer.
In the present study, we used computational biology methods to identify the shared signatures of ageing and cancer, which provides a strong addition to the conventional experimental meth- ods.
Our results revealed that there were some shared sig- natures of ageing concerned with multiple diﬀerent tissues, although most of the ageing-related signatures were tissue-speciﬁc.
This study also indicated some convergent signatures between ageing and cancer, which need to be experimentally veriﬁed.
It should be noted that in this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms linking ageing and cancer mainly based on genetic and genomic components, whereas epigenetic components like DNA  methylation, chromatin remodeling etc., may be equally important in contributing to ageing and cancer [47].
The following ﬁndings support our argument that there exist shared mechanisms underlying ageing and cancer.
First, using ageing-related datasets, we identiﬁed two highly signiﬁcant ageing-related pathways: pathways in cancer and the MAPK signaling pathway.
The ﬁrst path- way apparently links ageing with cancer, and the second one is involved in various cellular functions including cell proliferation, diﬀerentiation and migration that are strongly implicated in tumorigenesis as well.
Next, we found that most of the ageing-related gene signatures were diﬀerentially expressed among normal vs. tumor samples, indicative of their association with tumor.
The present study also reveals some critical molecular mechanisms that underlie both ageing and cancer such as cell cycle regulation, metabolic processes, DNA damage response, apoptosis, P53 signaling pathway and immune/ inﬂammatory response.
Among them, the immune/inﬂam- matory response is a particularly interesting clue in that the convergent pathways between ageing and cancer in Table 5 include multiple pathways correlated with immune/inﬂam- matory response: T cell receptor signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway and chemokine signaling pathway.
In fact, ample studies have indicated that dysregulation in the immune/inﬂammatory response was a key factor in causing ageing and cancer [48 50].
Previous studies have suggested that there were some crucial clues that linked ageing with cancer among which DNA damage, tumor-suppressor mechanisms, telomerase activity and stem cell turnover were four key components.
DNA damage is a convergent factor driving both ageing and tumorigenesis as the accumulation of a large amount of DNA damage can force the cell into one of three possi- ble states: senescence, apoptosis and uncontrolled cell  Table 3 Overlaps between the human ageing-related gene sets and the tumor-related gene sets Gene sets No.

However, the other three clues may be implicated in certain divergent mechanisms between ageing and cancer.
For example, for tumor-suppressor mechanisms, one possi- bility is that some tumor-suppressor genes like TP53 and RB1 contribute to ageing by promoting apoptosis and cel- lular senescence, which suppress the development of cancer [52].
For telomerase activity, although telomerase reactiva- tion may protect against age-related diseases and prema- ture ageing by maintenance of telomere length, it can raise the risk of the development of cancer [21].
For stem cell turnover, although a decline in the replicative function of certain stem-cell types can suppress the development of cancer, the decreased regenerative capacity appears to con- tribute to some aspects of human ageing [53].
The interre- lationship between stem cell, cancer and ageing is intricate and worthy of an in-depth investigation [54].
Although the common molecular mechanisms underly- ing ageing and cancer seem to be complex, the discovery of shared relationships between ageing and cancer might hold the potential promise of interventions that aim at extending human life-span by postponing ageing and pre- venting cancer.
to bias  It should be noted that the present results may be sub- ject related to the individual bioinformatics approach used in each original ageing and tumor gene expression dataset.
These gene expression datasets involve diﬀerent microarray platforms that used diﬀerent analysis tools, normalization strategies and statistical approaches.
An improved approach would be to analyze all the raw ageing and tumor microarray data under one united com- putational framework with the same statistical standards including P values, fold change cut-oﬀs and FDR etc.
This would greatly enhance the accuracy of results arising from comparison of diﬀerent studies.
Materials and methods  Datasets  Three classes of datasets were analyzed in this study.
The ﬁrst one was obtained from 10 publications which identiﬁed ageing-related genes by microarray from six diﬀerent human tissues including brain, eye, kidney, muscle, skin and blood (Table 1).
The second one was obtained from a web resource that collected a list of human ageing-related genes (http://www.genomics.senescence.info/genes/allgenes.php).
The third one encompassed 25 human tumor gene expres- sion datasets related to 15 diﬀerent tumor types (Table S7).
Identiﬁcation of human ageing-related genes  Based on the ﬁrst class of datasets, we identiﬁed ageing- related human genes by the set union operation of the 10 gene sets derived from the 10 publications (only named genes were included).
Gene set function analysis  We performed functional analysis of gene sets using DAVID tools to identify the important GO terms and KEGG pathways relevant to gene sets.
Identiﬁcation of tumor-related genes  We identiﬁed tumor-related genes for the 25 human tumor gene expression datasets by carrying out a class compari- son algorithm.
A total of 28 normal vs. tumor phenotype classes comparisons were carried out (some datasets were involved in multiple tumor subtypes).
We identiﬁed diﬀer- entially expressed genes among normal vs. tumor pheno- type classes using univariate F-test for unpaired samples or t-test for paired samples at 0.05 signiﬁcance threshold level (P   0.05).
This procedure was implemented with the class comparison between groups of array tools in BRB-ArrayTools, an integrated package for the visualiza- tion and statistical analysis of DNA microarray gene expression data [55].
The software can be freely down- loaded from the website: http://www.linus.nci.nih.gov/ BRB-ArrayTools.html.
We identiﬁed the diﬀerentially expressed genes as tumor-related genes.
