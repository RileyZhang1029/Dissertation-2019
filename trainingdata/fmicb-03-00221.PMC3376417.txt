The extent to which geochemical variation shapes the distribution of phototrophic metab-
olisms was modeled based on 439 observations in geothermal springs in Yellowstone
National Park (YNP), Wyoming. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were developed to
predict the distribution of phototrophic metabolism as a function of spring temperature,
pH, and total sulﬁde. GAMs comprised of temperature explained 38.8% of the variation
in the distribution of phototrophic metabolism, whereas GAMs comprised of sulﬁde and
pH explained 19.6 and 11.2% of the variation, respectively. These results suggest that of
the measured variables, temperature is the primary constraint on the distribution of pho-
totrophs in YNP. GAMs comprised of multiple variables explained a larger percentage of
the variation in the distribution of phototrophic metabolism, indicating additive interactions
among variables. A GAM that combined temperature and sulﬁde explained the greatest
variation in the dataset (53.4%) while minimizing the introduction of degrees of freedom. In
an effort to verify the extent to which phototroph distribution reﬂects constraints on activity,
we examined the inﬂuence of sulﬁde and temperature on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
uptake rates under both light and dark conditions. Light-driven DIC uptake decreased sys-
tematically with increasing concentrations of sulﬁde in acidic, algal-dominated systems,
but was unaffected in alkaline, cyanobacterial-dominated systems. In both alkaline and
acidic systems, light-driven DIC uptake was suppressed in cultures incubated at temper-
atures 10˚C greater than their in situ temperature. Collectively, these quantitative results
indicate that apart from light availability, the habitat range of phototrophs in YNP springs is
deﬁned largely by constraints imposed ﬁrstly by temperature and secondly by sulﬁde on
the activity of these populations that inhabit the edges of the habitat range.These ﬁndings
are consistent with the predictions from GAMs and provide a quantitative framework from
which to translate distributional patterns into ﬁtness landscapes for use in interpreting the
environmental constraints that have shaped the evolution of this process through Earth
history.

INTRODUCTION
The distribution of organisms and the functions that they cat-
alyze on Earth today is rooted, at least in part, to the numerous
adaptations that enable life to radiate into new ecological niches
that have played out over evolutionary time. Such responses are
recorded in extant organismal distribution patterns (e.g., habi-
tat range), as well as in the genetic record of organisms. This
is a consequence of the predisposition for microorganisms to
acquire their ecological traits through vertical inheritance, a phe-
nomenon that manifests in a positive relationship between the
ecological relatedness of organisms and their evolutionary related-
ness (niche conservatism; Wiens, 2004; Wiens and Graham, 2005).
Thus, extant patterns in the distribution of species or metabolic
function offer “a window into the past” and can be used to infer

historical constraints on the evolution of a particular metabolic
function as imposed by the environment (Wiens and Graham,
2005; Westoby, 2006; Boyd et al., 2010; Hamilton et al., 2011a,b).
Such observations can in turn be used to predict the response
of populations or metabolic guilds to changing environmental
conditions (Keddy, 1992; Lavorel and Garnier, 2002; Guisan and
Thuiller, 2005).

The extreme variation in the geochemical composition of
present day environments is likely to encompass those that were
present on early Earth (Shock and Holland, 2007), when key meta-
bolic processes such as photosynthesis are thought to have evolved.
Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Wyoming harbors >12,000
geothermal features that vary widely in temperature and geochem-
ical composition, both spatially and temporally (Nordstrom et al.,

Modeling the habitat range of photosynthesis

2005; Shock et al., 2010). Such environments provide a ﬁeld labora-
tory for examining the tendency for guilds of organisms to inhabit
particular ecological niches and to deﬁne the range of geochemical
conditions tolerated by that functional guild (i.e., habitat range or
zone of habitability; Hoehler, 2007; Shock and Holland, 2007). We
assume that since it is unlikely that a metabolic process emerged
under environmental conditions that no longer support that func-
tion, such information can help quantify the habitat range for a
metabolic process, and can provide insight into the characteristics
of an environment that enabled the adaptation of that process into
new habitats.

Phototrophy is the utilization of solar energy by plants, algae,
and certain bacteria to generate energy for the synthesis of complex
organic molecules (Blankenship, 1992; Chew and Bryant, 2007). A
number of recent studies have documented non-random pattern
in the distribution of phototrophic assemblages along geochem-
ical gradients in YNP, Wyoming (Boyd et al., 2010; Cox et al.,
2011; Hamilton et al., 2011b). These studies qualitatively iden-
tiﬁed three ecological axes (temperature, pH, and total sulﬁde)
that appear to constrain the habitat range of phototrophs in
the geothermal features of YNP. However, the extent to which
each environmental parameter, or combinations therein, shape
the distribution of phototrophic metabolism in YNP is unclear.
Moreover, it is unclear if the qualitative trends in the distribu-
tion of phototrophic metabolism in YNP noted previously are
the result of the negative effects that temperature, pH, and sul-
ﬁde have on the activity of phototrophic populations, which
in turn would be expected to decrease ﬁtness and limit their
distribution.

Here, in an effort to better deﬁne the basis for the observed
habitat range of phototrophs in YNP, we compiled environmental
metadata and presence/absence distributional data from several-
independent examinations of phototrophic metabolisms across
the YNP geothermal complex (Boyd et al., 2010; Cox et al.,
2011; Hamilton et al., 2011b). This binary dataset comprising
439-independent observations was used to construct generalized
additive models (GAMs) for use in quantifying and ranking the
role of temperature, pH, and total sulﬁde in shaping the habi-
tat range of phototrophs. Using this approach, it was determined
that temperature was the primary predictor of the distribution of
phototrophs in YNP springs, followed by dissolved sulﬁde con-
centration and pH. We evaluated these predictions using short
incubation (<1 h) microcosm studies in several select geothermal
springs. Collectively, the GAMs and microcosm studies support a
model whereby a temperature of 73˚C sets the upper temperature
limit for phototrophic metabolism in circum neutral to alkaline
springs due to constraints imposed by these parameters on the ﬁt-
ness of the constituent populations. The upper temperature limit
for the distribution of phototrophic metabolism decreases with
decreasing pH due to the sulﬁde-dependent suppression of pho-
totrophic activity in algae, the predominant phototrophs in springs
with pH <5.0. These results establish the ecological constraints on
the activity and presumably the ﬁtness of phototrophs at the edge
of their habitat range in YNP and provide insight into the envi-
ronmental parameters that have shaped the evolution of this key
metabolic process over evolutionary time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
PREDICTIVE MODELING
The binary distribution (presence/absence) of genes involved in
chlorophyll biosynthesis and/or phototrophic pigments in a num-
ber of geothermal springs sampled from across YNP (Figure 1)
and the associated total sulﬁde, pH, and temperature of the spring
water was extracted from three previous studies (Boyd et al., 2010;
Cox et al., 2011; Hamilton et al., 2011b). The dataset extracted
from Cox et al. (2011) was based on the visual distribution of
pigments in geothermal springs, whereas the datasets extracted
from Boyd et al. (2010) and Hamilton et al. (2011b) was based on
the presence/absence of the protochlorophyllide reductase sub-
unit L gene (chlL/bchL) required to synthesize chlorophyll in both
anoxygenic and oxygenic phototrophs (Chew and Bryant, 2007)
in biomass sampled from geothermal springs in YNP. While the
data extracted from each of the aforementioned studies were from
observations made in different springs from different regions dur-
ing different years, plots of the overall phototroph distribution
trends with respect to pH, temperature, and sulﬁde as presented in
all three manuscripts (Boyd et al., 2010; Cox et al., 2011; Hamilton
et al., 2011b) and in Figures 2A,B revealed the same trends, with
an upper temperature limit for photosynthesis of ∼73˚C and a
pH-dependent suppression of the upper temperature limit below
pH ∼6. Moreover, the distribution of phototrophic metabolism
was constrained to environments with sulﬁde at a concentration
of <5 µM (Cox et al., 2011; Hamilton et al., 2011b). Together, these
observations indicate that both methods, as described above, were
suitable for mapping the habitat range of phototrophic metabo-
lism along ecological gradients in YNP. By combining the datasets,
we were able to sample a much greater portion of the YNP geot-
hermal complex that comprised more than 439 observations, than
any one dataset provided alone.

Binomial GAMs describing the distribution of phototrophic
pigments and genes involved in their synthesis as proxies for pho-
totrophs were generated using the mgcv package (Wood, 2011)
within the base package R (ver. 2.10.1), using default settings.
GAMs are ﬂexible models for ﬁtting smooth curves to data, while
maintaining parsimony. In essence, GAMs function to blend the
properties of generalized linear models with the features of addi-
tive models. These approaches are commonly utilized in describing
the distribution of plant species as a function of ecological parame-
ters (Yee and Mitchell, 1991; Guisan et al., 2002). Here, a dependent
variable (e.g., distribution of phototrophs) is plotted as a function
of an independent variable(s) (e.g., temperature, pH, and sulﬁde)
followed by the calculation of a smooth curve that goes through
the data. The GAM approach is considered to be superior to linear-
based regression methods (e.g., Pearson correlation analysis) since
it does not require the problematic steps of a priori estimation of
response curve shape or a speciﬁc parametric response function
(Hastie and Tibshirini, 1986; Wood, 2004, 2011), but rather allows
the data to determine the shape of the response curve in order to
maximize the expected log likelihood, or ﬁt of the model to the
data. In the present study, GAMs were generated to describe the
dependence of the distribution of phototrophic metabolism on
environment, speciﬁcally spring temperature, pH, and dissolved
sulﬁde concentration. We evaluated the ﬁt of each GAM to the

data using a number of approaches including the Akaike Infor-
mation Criterion (AIC), a maximum likelihood-based approach.

areas sampled and locations of physiological sites. Hydrothermal areas

represented with open circles, in order from Northwest to Southeast are
Bijah Spring, Nymph Creek, Dragon Spring, and Perpetual Spouter.

We considered the model with the lowest AIC value to be the
best and evaluated the relative plausibility of each other model by
examining differences between the AIC value for the best model
and values for every other model (∆AIC; Johnson and Omland,
2004). The degrees of freedom (Df) for each model was used as a
proxy to estimate the complexity of the model, with more com-
plex models comprised of more Df. Models that achieve minimal
AIC and residual deviance on the fewest Df (introduction of few
smooth parameters during data ﬁtting) are more likely to repli-
cate in subsequent validation studies, when compared to those
with greater Df (introduction of the additional smooth parame-
ters during data ﬁtting). Thus models with low AIC and low Df
are lower complexity and are more parsimonious with the data.

GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSES
pH and temperature were measured with a WTW 330i meter and
probe (WTW Inc., College Station, TX, USA) or a model 59002-00
Cole-Parmer temperature-compensated pH meter (Vernon Hills,
IL, USA). Conductivity was measured with a model YSI30 or YSI
EcoSense EC300 conductivity meter (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH,
USA). Total dissolved sulﬁde was determined using the methyl-
ene blue method and a Hach DR/2000 spectrophotometer (Hach
Company, Loveland, CO, USA). Aliquots used for analysis of dis-
solved inorganic carbon (DIC) were collected in 40 mL amber
borosilicate vials with black butyl septa. All sample vials were
ﬁlled to minimize head space and sealed to minimize degassing
and atmospheric contamination. DIC concentrations were mea-
sured with an OI Analytical Model 1010 Wet Oxidation TOC
Analyzer. DIC determinations for Perpetual Spouter and Dragon
Spring, both of which were performed in August of 2011, were
determined using an ON-LINE TOC-VCSHTOC/TIC and TN
analyzer (Shimadzu Scientiﬁc Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA).
Bioﬁlms/sediments were dried in an oven for 3 days at ∼90˚C, and

(EA-IR-MS; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
Data were standardized using the organic standards described

INORGANIC CARBON UPTAKE IN CHEMOTROPHIC AND
PHOTOTROPHIC COMMUNITIES
Total DIC uptake was assessed using slight modiﬁcations to
methods described previously (Boyd et al., 2009b). Brieﬂy,
chemotrophic and phototrophic mats were collected from points
that were approximately 1 cm up gradient (chemotrophic mat)
and 1 cm down gradient (chlorophototrophic mat) from the
photosynthetic fringe at Bijah Spring (Norris-Mammoth Corri-
dor; Easting: 521287, Northing: 4956460), Nymph Creek (Norris
Geyser Basin; Easting: 521690, Northing: 4955601), and Dragon
Spring (Norris Geyser Basin; Easting: 522889, Northing: 4953218;
Figure 1) during March of 2010 (Table 1). The sampling loca-
tions in each spring were perpendicular to the photosynthetic
fringe. Samples were collected aseptically using a syringe and were
placed in a 15 mL sterile polypropylene tube, with the exception
of the chemotrophic community at Bijah Spring (see below). The
tube and the contents were shaken vigorously to uniformly resus-
pend the contents and create a slurry. From this slurry, 500 µL
aliquots of re-suspended solids were injected into pre-sterilized
and anaerobic (N2 headspace) 20 mL serum bottles sealed with
a butyl stopper. Alternatively, in the case of chemotrophic com-
munities from Bijah Spring, ∼500 mg of sediment was placed in
20 mL serum bottles using a sterile scoop. Bottles containing Bijah
Spring chemotrophic sediments were then capped, sealed, and
purged with N2 gas. In all experiments, 10 mL of spring water
sampled directly at the photosynthetic fringe was injected into
each vial such that the spring water and gas composition was the
same. Killed controls were prepared by addition of glutaraldehyde
to a ﬁnal concentration of 2.0%, v/v. To assess the potential for
dark DIC uptake, vials were wrapped completely in aluminum

foil. All assays (biological and killed controls, light and dark incu-
bations) were performed in triplicate. The reaction was initiated
by addition of NaH14CO3 (MP Biomedicals, 422 MBq/mmol) to a
ﬁnal concentration of 2.13× 106 Bq/L. Serum bottles were placed
in a clear polypropylene bag (secondary containment) and were
incubated in the spring at the photosynthetic fringe for approx-
imately 60 min. Following incubation, vials were placed directly
on dry ice to stop the reaction. The vials remained frozen until
further processed at the lab. Vials were thawed and acidiﬁed
to pH <2.0 using concentrated HCl. Serum bottles and their
contents were degassed with N2(∼5 min.) and the biomass was
ﬁltered onto 0.2 µm pore size, 25 mm diameter white Nucleo-
pore polycarbonate membranes (Whatman Inc., Florham Park,
NJ, USA). Filtered biomass was washed with ∼10 mL of ster-
ile denionized water, placed in scintillation vials, and dried at
80˚C overnight. In the case of samples from Bijah Spring, the
vials containing sediment were then weighed and subtracted
from empty vials such that all measurements could be normal-
ized to grams of organic nitrogen present in the inoculum. The
total solid content in each slurry used to inoculate the reac-
tions (with the exception of Bijah chemotrophic communities)
was determined by drying triplicate 1 mL aliquots at 80˚C for
48 h.

Dried biomass and ﬁlters were overlain with 10 mL Cytoscint
and were subjected to liquid scintillation counting as previously
described (Boyd et al., 2009b). Total uptake was determined using
previously described methods (Lizotte et al., 1996) using DIC
numbers determined for each spring. For the purpose of com-
paring total DIC uptake between chemotrophic and phototrophic
communities, rates of uptake were ﬁrst normalized to dry weight
of biomass per reaction and then to grams of organic nitrogen. All
reported values reﬂect the difference in uptake between biological
controls and glutaraldehyde-killed controls.

INFLUENCE OF SULFIDE AND TEMPERATURE ON DIC UPTAKE IN
PHOTOTROPHIC COMMUNITIES
The inﬂuence of sulﬁde on DIC uptake in phototrophic com-
munities was determined using the same approach as described
above. Experiments were performed at Nymph Creek (May 2010),

Modeling the habitat range of photosynthesis

Dragon Spring (August 2011), and Perpetual Spouter (August
2011; Table 1). Perpetual Spouter (Norris Geyser Basin; East-
ing: 523034, Northing: 4952620) was chosen to replace Bijah
Spring, due to difﬁculties in accessing the latter during peri-
ods of heavy visitor trafﬁc. Prior to the initiation of the reac-
tion with NaH14CO3, microcosms were amended with varying
concentrations of an anaerobic and sterile sodium sulﬁde solu-
tion. Na2S was added to microcosms from Nymph Creek at a
concentration of 5 and 20 µM, whereas Na2S amendments of
only 5 µM were made in microcosms from Perpetual Spouter
and Dragon Spring. The concentration of sulﬁde to amend each
microcosm with was determined empirically, such that the ﬁnal
concentration was ∼5 µM greater than that present naturally
at the photosynthetic fringe. Light-independent and killed con-
trols were prepared as described above. All assays (biological
and killed controls, light and dark incubations) were performed
in triplicate. Reactions were initiated by addition of NaH14CO3
(MP Biomedicals, 422 MBq/mmol) to a ﬁnal concentration of
1.66× 107 Bq/L. Serum bottles were incubated and processed
as described above. The inﬂuence of elevated temperature on
DIC uptake was examined in phototrophic communities sam-
pled from Perpetual Spouter and Dragon Spring in August of
2011. Microcosms were set up as described above using bio-
mass and spring water sampled from phototrophic mats near
the fringe of each respective spring. Light-independent and killed
controls were prepared as described above. All assays (biological
and killed controls, light and dark incubations) were performed
in triplicate. Reactions were initiated by addition of NaH14CO3
(MP Biomedicals, 422 MBq/mmol) to a ﬁnal concentration of
1.66× 107 Bq/L. Serum bottles were incubated and processed as
described above.

RESULTS
The presence or absence of phototrophic pigments and/or genes
involved in their synthesis were used as proxies for examining
the distribution of this metabolism along gradients in temper-
ature, pH, and total sulﬁde in 439 samples (Figure 2) from a
variety of geothermal springs throughout YNP (Figure 1) using
GAM approaches. GAMs identiﬁed spring temperature as the
top individual variable for predicting the distribution of pho-
totrophic metabolisms (∆AIC= 92.4, Df = 6.2), followed by total
sulﬁde concentration (∆AIC= 192.1, Df = 3.9) and spring pH
(∆AIC= 244.2, Df = 8.6; Table 2). GAMs that comprised tem-
perature explained 38.8% of the variance in the distribution of
phototrophic metabolisms, whereas GAMs that comprised total
sulﬁde or pH explained 19.6 and 11.2% of the variance in the
dataset, respectively. GAMs that incorporated more than one envi-
ronmental variable generally ﬁt the data better and explained a
greater amount of the variance than GAMs comprised of indi-
vidual environmental variables, indicating additive interactions
among variables. Importantly, the variation in temperature, pH,
and sulﬁde in YNP springs were not correlated (Pearson R2 < 0.06
for all pairwise regressions), indicating that these variables behave
independently in the YNP springs analyzed in this study. A GAM
that comprised spring temperature, pH, and total sulﬁde was the
top ranking model (∆AIC= 0.0) and explained 66.6% of the
variance in the dataset, the most of any GAM, although this

model required the introduction of 14.7 Df. GAMs that com-
prised temperature and sulﬁde (∆AIC= 39.3) and temperature
and pH (∆AIC= 51.3) explained lower fractions of the variance
in the dataset (53.4 and 52.9%, respectively), but required the
introduction of fewer Df (8.2 and 11.1, respectively). Collectively,
the GAM that comprised temperature and sulﬁde explained the
greatest amount of the variation in the dataset while minimizing
the introduction of Df.

Prior to examining the inﬂuence of physical and chemical con-
straints on the activity of phototrophs in YNP, it was necessary to
determine if the photosynthetic fringe (Figure 3) was the result
of competition between phototrophs and chemotrophs for this
niche, as this was previously suggested (Boyd et al., 2009b). Com-
petition experiments were performed at the photosynthetic fringe
in Nymph Creek (pH 2.99, 52.7˚C), Dragon Spring (pH 2.95,
46.5˚C), and Bijah Spring (pH 7.40, 70.0˚C) in March of 2010.
The phototrophic assemblages near the photosynthetic fringe at
both Nymph Creek and Dragon Spring are both comprised of
algae related to Cyanidioschyzon sp. (Ferris et al., 2005; Lehr et al.,
2007; Boyd et al., 2009a), whereas the phototrophic assemblages
near the photosynthetic fringe at Bijah Spring are dominated by
Synechococcus sp. and Roseiﬂexus sp. (King et al., 2006). Popula-
tions comprising the chemosynthetic assemblages near the fringe
in both Nymph Creek and Dragon Spring are thought to be com-
prised primarily of organisms afﬁliated with Hydrogenobacter sp.,
Desulfurella sp., and Acidimicrobium sp. (Jackson et al., 2001; Ferris
et al., 2003), whereas populations associated with chemotrophic
assemblages in Bijah Spring are most closely related to Thermotoga
sp. (King et al., 2006).

When incubated in the light, DIC uptake rates in chemotrophic
assemblages sampled ∼1 cm from the photosynthetic fringe at
Nymph Creek, Dragon Spring, and Bijah Spring (Figure 3) were
not signiﬁcantly different (P = 0.32, 0.62, 0.47, respectively), from
rates when incubated in the dark (Figure 4), which indicates that
the mats were unlikely to be using light to drive DIC uptake. In con-
trast, rates of DIC uptake in photosynthetic assemblages sampled
∼1 cm from the photosynthetic fringe at Nymph Creek, Dragon
Spring, and Bijah Spring were signiﬁcantly different (P = 0.01,
0.04, 0.01, respectively), when incubated in the light versus when
incubated in the dark, indicating that these assemblages were using

DIC uptake rates were normalized to grams organic nitrogen present in the

light to drive a portion of DIC uptake. Rates of DIC uptake in
phototrophic assemblages sampled ∼1 cm from the photosyn-
thetic fringe at Nymph Creek, Dragon Spring, and Bijah Spring,
when incubated in the light, were signiﬁcantly greater (P < 0.05
for all comparisons) than rates of DIC uptake in chemosynthetic
mats from those springs, regardless of whether the chemosyn-
thetic mats were incubated in the light or the dark. Importantly,
rates of DIC uptake in chemotrophic and phototrophic assem-
blages sampled ∼1 cm on either side of the photosynthetic fringe
at Nymph Creek, Dragon Spring, and Bijah Spring, when incu-
bated in the dark, were not signiﬁcantly different (P = 0.15, 0.93,
0.08, respectively), suggesting that normalizing overall rates of
uptake to organic N is unlikely to be responsible for the differ-
ences in the rates observed in chemotrophic and phototrophic
assemblages. Collectively, these results suggest that competition
for DIC between phototrophs and chemotrophs is unlikely to
be the basis of the photosynthetic fringe observed in acidic (e.g.,
Nymph Creek and Dragon Spring) and alkaline (e.g., Bijah Spring)
ecosystems.

The inﬂuence of sulﬁde on DIC uptake by phototrophic
assemblages sampled near the photosynthetic fringe at Nymph
Creek (fringe pH= 2.89, Temp.= 52.1˚C, total sulﬁde≤ 150 nM),
Dragon Spring (fringe pH= 2.60, Temp.= 46.2˚C, total sul-
ﬁde= ∼1 µM), and Perpetual Spouter
(fringe pH= 7.12,
Temp.= 68.6˚C, total sulﬁde≤ 150 nM) was examined in both
light and dark incubations in March of 2010 (Nymph Creek) and
August of 2011 (Dragon Spring and Perpetual Spouter; Figure 3).
An amount of sodium sulﬁde was added to microcosms in order

to generate a ﬁnal concentration that was ∼5 µM greater than that
present in spring water ﬂowing over the photosynthetic fringe in
each spring. When compared to unamended controls, the addi-
tion of sulﬁde to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 µM in microcosms
containing photosynthetic mat sampled from near the photosyn-
thetic fringe at Nymph Creek resulted in a signiﬁcant (P = 0.04)
decrease (∼56% of unamended control rate) in the rate of DIC
uptake (Figure 5A). The addition of sulﬁde to a ﬁnal concentration
of 20 µM in microcosms containing photosynthetic mat sampled
from near the photosynthetic fringe at Nymph Creek resulted
in a signiﬁcant (P < 0.01) decrease (31% of unamended control
rate) when compared to the unamended control DIC uptake rate
(Figure 5A). The DIC uptake rates in unamended controls were
not signiﬁcantly different from the sulﬁde amended controls (5
and 20 µM) in microcosms containing photosynthetic mat from
Nymph Creek when incubated in the dark, suggesting that sulﬁde
did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence chemosynthetic DIC uptake in the
microcosm incubations.
The rate of light-driven DIC uptake was also signiﬁcantly
(P = 0.04) suppressed (∼55% of unamended control rate) by the
addition of sulﬁde to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 µM in micro-
cosms containing microbial mat sampled near the photosynthetic
fringe at Dragon Spring, whereas the rate of dark DIC were
not signiﬁcantly affected (P = 0.33) by the addition of sulﬁde
(Figure 5B). Interestingly, the rate of light-driven DIC uptake
was not signiﬁcantly (P = 0.08) affected by the addition of sul-
ﬁde when added to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 µM in microcosms

photosynthetic mats present in Nymph Creek and Dragon Spring,
but has no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on rates of DIC uptake in Per-
petual Spouter, which is dominated by bacterial phototrophs most
closely afﬁliated with Synechococcus sp. and Roseiﬂexus sp. (Hamil-
ton et al., 2011b). The rate of DIC uptake when incubated in the
dark was unaffected by the addition of sulﬁde, regardless of the
sampling location.

ined in phototrophic mats sampled from near the photosyn-

2.2% of the rate of light-driven DIC uptake in microcosms at

Modeling the habitat range of photosynthesis

The rates of DIC uptake in microcosms incubated in the dark at
the higher temperature locations in Dragon Spring and Perpet-
ual Spouter were 139 and 32% of those measured in microcosms
incubated at the fringe, respectively. Thus, DIC uptake in algal
populations that comprise the phototrophic assemblage at Dragon
Spring and the cyanobacterial populations that comprise the pho-
totrophic assemblage at Perpetual Spouter are apparently more
sensitive to temperature stress than the chemotrophic populations
in these assemblages.

DISCUSSION
The innovation of photosynthesis, speciﬁcally the photosynthetic
apparatus capable of splitting water into O2, protons, and elec-
trons, was a pivotal point in the evolution of Earth’s biogeo-
chemical cycles (Blankenship, 1992; Anbar, 2008; Falkowski and
Isozaki, 2008) and the emergence of complex life (Raymond and
Segrè, 2006; Boyd et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011a). While stud-
ies continue to reﬁne our understanding of when these events
are likely to have occurred (Anbar et al., 2007; Buick, 2008; Ses-
sions et al., 2009), far fewer studies have focused on understanding
the ecological interactions that are likely to have inﬂuenced the
evolution of photosynthesis. The extreme variation in geochem-
ical composition present in YNP’s >12,000 geothermal features
(Nordstrom et al., 2005; Shock et al., 2010) offer a multitude of
spatial gradients that directly select for organisms with enhanced
performance or ﬁtness under a given set of conditions (Brock,
1967; Allewalt et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2009). In the present
study, the distribution of photosynthesis along spatial gradients
of temperature, sulﬁde, and pH from 439 geothermal springs
was quantitatively mapped using GAMs in order to identify the
constraints on the habitat range of phototrophic metabolisms
in the YNP geothermal complex. Microcosm studies served to
determine whether the edges of the habitat range were due to
constraints on the activity of the constituent populations, in
an attempt to begin to translate the habitat range to a ﬁtness
landscape.

Aside from light availability, GAMs indicated that the pri-
mary variable inﬂuencing the distribution of photosynthesis was
temperature, with sulﬁde as the second most signiﬁcant pre-
dictor of the distribution of photosynthetic metabolism. These
quantitative rankings are consistent with previous qualitative dis-
tribution patterns noted across YNP (Cox et al., 2011; Hamil-
ton et al., 2011b) as well as with physiological data obtained
from cultivated algae and cyanobacteria. Photosystem II (PSII),
the water splitting complex present in cyanobacteria, algae, and
plants (Blankenship, 1992, 2010) is sensitive to sulﬁde in some,
but not all, oxygenic phototrophs (Castenholz, 1977; Oren et al.,
1979; Miller and Bebout, 2004). To examine whether the sulﬁde-
dependent pattern in the distribution of phototrophs is due to
suppression of photosynthetic activity (presumably through the
toxicity to PSII) DIC uptake rates in the presence and absence
of sulﬁde were compared. DIC uptake in alkaline phototrophic
assemblages likely to be dominated by cyanobacteria was unaf-
fected by the addition of 5 µM sulﬁde, whereas DIC uptake in
acidic phototrophic assemblages likely to be dominated by algae
was suppressed by sulﬁde at a concentration of 5 µM. The pre-
dominant form of sulﬁde at acidic pH (pH <6–7) is H2S(aq)

(Amend and Shock, 2001), which is also the form thought to
be responsible for PSII toxicity since it easily diffuses across the
cell membrane (Howsley and Pearson, 1979). Thus, the physi-
ological sensitivity to sulﬁde at concentrations as low as 5 µM
observed in photosynthetic assemblages inhabiting acidic springs
is consistent with the presence of algal phototrophs in acidic envi-
ronments (pH <5.0) only when the total sulﬁde concentration
was less than ∼5 µM (Figure 2). Thus, the physiological con-
straints imposed by sulﬁde impairs activity, which in turn likely
renders algal populations unﬁt to successfully replicate in these
environments. This decrease in ﬁtness would in turn likely limit the
distribution of algae to YNP habitats with sulﬁde concentrations
of <5 µM.

Existing data indicate that the photosynthetic populations
inhabiting the edge of the phototrophic habitat range in acidic
environments (pH <5.0) are comprised primarily of algae related
to Cyanidioschyzon sp. (Ferris et al., 2005; Lehr et al., 2007;
Boyd et al., 2009a). The habitat range for Cyanidioschyzon sp.
appears to vary depending on the spring being examined. For
example, Cyanidioschyzon sp. mats are commonly observed in
acidic springs in Norris Geyser Basin and other locales in YNP
at temperatures approaching ∼57˚C (Lehr et al., 2007), yet in
other acidic springs in YNP and global-distributed hydrothermal
ﬁelds such as those in Japan, their distribution is constrained to
lower temperatures (∼40–50˚C; Cox et al., 2011; Hamilton et al.,
2011b). This suggests that minor variations in the composition
of the ﬂuid in individual acidic springs might be limiting the
activity of algal populations and impacting their reproductive
ﬁtness and distributional pattern. This hypothesis is consistent
with the “patchy” distribution of phototrophic metabolism in
environments with pH <5 and temperatures lower than 56˚C
(Figure 2A). Previous studies have noted rapid decreases in sul-
ﬁde as a function of increasing distances from the source in
acidic springs either through degassing or oxidation via biolog-
ical or abiological mechanisms (Langner et al., 2001; D’Imperio
et al., 2008; Cox et al., 2011). This observation, together with the
variability in total sulﬁde concentrations in the source waters of
acidic features (Shock et al., 2010), is likely to result in differ-
ences among points in the thermal transects where total sulﬁde
concentrations drop below 5 µM, the apparent upper limit tol-
erated by Cyanidioschyzon-like populations in YNP (Figure 2B).
In turn, such variation would likely impact the temperature at
the point in the thermal transect where algal photosynthesis is
possible.

The inﬂuence of temperature on DIC uptake rates was also
examined in alkaline and acidic springs, since a previous study
indicated that a strain of Synechococcus isolated from YNP was
photosynthetically active at a temperature of 75˚C (Allewalt et al.,
2006), 2˚C warmer than has been observed in YNP (Figure 2A).
Although light-driven DIC uptake was observed in algal- and
cyanobacterial-dominated phototrophic assemblages incubated
at temperature locations that were 10˚C higher (56 and 78˚C,
respectively), than the in situ temperature where the mats were
sampled (46 and 68˚C, respectively), it only represented 3 and
2%, respectively, of the activities observed at the in situ tem-
perature. This ﬁnding is consistent with previous results indi-
cating that photosynthesis in natural communities and isolates

Modeling the habitat range of photosynthesis

is most efﬁcient at temperatures that correspond to those of
the environment where the phototrophic assemblages were sam-
pled, apparently due to evolutionary optimization to inhabit
that particular ecological niche (Brock, 1967; Miller and Cas-
tenholz, 2000; Allewalt et al., 2006). To the extent that DIC
uptake reﬂects the overall physiological state of the photosyn-
thetic assemblages, these results indicate that temperature con-
strains the distribution of photosynthesis due to its effects on the
physiology of the organisms comprising the community, thereby
decreasing their overall ﬁtness. As summarized by Cox et al.
(2011) numerous hypotheses have been put forth regarding the
mechanisms through which temperature may limit phototro-
phy, including arguments regarding protein stability (Kempner,
1963) and the functionality of the CO2-assimilating mechanism
under thermal stress (Meeks and Castenholz, 1978). Biochemi-
cal experimentation that is beyond the scope of this study will
be required to elucidate the molecules that are most sensitive
to temperature stress and which are likely to restrict the diver-
siﬁcation of phototrophs to environments with temperatures
>73˚C.

Although evidence is presented here to indicate that photosyn-
thesis is possible at temperatures as high as 78˚C, it is unlikely
that this activity is sufﬁcient for reproductive success considering
that photosynthesis has never been observed in nature above a
temperature of ∼73˚C(Brock, 1967). In acidic environments (pH
<4–5), the upper temperature limit for the distribution of pho-
tosynthetic metabolism is limited to locations with temperatures
of less than ∼57˚C (Lehr et al., 2007; Boyd et al., 2009b, 2010;
Cox et al., 2011; Hamilton et al., 2011b). This is likely due to the
transition from cyanobacterial-dominated phototrophic ecosys-
tems to algal-dominated photosynthetic ecosystems over this pH
interval (Brock, 1973; Hamilton et al., 2011b) coupled with the
suppression of phototrophic activity in algae by hydrogen sulﬁde.
As a result of degassing and oxidation (Langner et al., 2001; Cox
et al., 2011), the elevated sulﬁde concentrations that are common
in source ﬂuids dissipate, ultimately reaching the concentrations of
less than ∼5 µM that enable algal phototrophs to grow and repro-
duce. Considering that numerous microorganisms have evolved
to thrive at temperatures of >73˚C (Brock, 1985) and a number
of cyanobacteria have evolved to tolerate up to mM concentra-
tions of sulﬁde (Oren et al., 1979; Miller and Bebout, 2004),
it is unclear why phototrophs have not radiated and expanded
their habitat boundaries in YNP. Perhaps the edges of the habi-
tat range reﬂect intrinsic limits of the photosynthetic apparatus
itself. Such a scenario corresponds to a deep valley on a ﬁtness
landscape, whereby the sole mechanism to adapt to a higher tem-
perature (high physiological stress) is through signiﬁcant and
rapid adaptation (Keymer et al., 2006). However, if trade-offs
or costs associated with adaptation to higher temperatures result
in a loss of ﬁtness at the expense of the adaptive advantage for
a thermotolerant photosynthetic apparatus, the organism will
not persist and diversiﬁcation will collapse back to the ancestral
state. Additional physiological studies, employing an evolution-
ary framework such as that used by Miller and colleagues (Miller
and Castenholz, 2000; Miller, 2003), will be required to elucidate
the physiological parameter(s) underlying the upper temperature
limit for photosynthesis.

Generalized additive models that comprise multiple explana-
tory variables were signiﬁcant predictors of the distribution of
phototrophic metabolisms in YNP, indicating additive interactions
among variables that constrain their habitat range. However, it is
not known if the additive interactions that lead to distributional
patterns reﬂect additive constraints on the ﬁtness of populations
that comprise the habitat edge communities. Additional studies
using ecologically representative isolates will facilitate the exami-
nation of the effect of co-variation among target parameters under
controlled conditions on the activities and ﬁtness of phototrophic
populations. Importantly, a GAM that comprised variation in tem-
perature, sulﬁde, and pH was only capable of explaining 67% of
the variation in the distribution of photosynthetic metabolisms,
indicating that 33% of the variation is due to other unaccounted
for variables. Elevated concentrations of metals are common in
YNP geothermal environments including copper, mercury, and
zinc (McCleskey et al., 2005; King et al., 2006; Boyd et al., 2009a;
Wang et al., 2011b). Such metals have been shown to inhibit the
activity of photosynthetic organisms, primarily through their dis-
ruption of the light harvesting apparatus (Clijsters and van Assche,
1985; Küpper et al., 2002). The speciation and bioavailability of
many metals, including mercury (Barkay et al., 2010; Wang et al.,
2011b), vary with the composition and pH of the environment.
Thus, the inﬂuence of pH on deﬁning the habitat range of pho-
tosynthetic metabolism as identiﬁed by GAMs may relate to the
bioavailability and speciation of the numerous metals that co-vary
with pH and result in a decrease in the ﬁtness of phototrophic
organisms in YNP. It has also been suggested that the availabil-
ity of DIC, which tends to be lower at high temperature(Weyl,
1959) and which tends to speciate toward carbonic acid at low
pH (Amend and Shock, 2001), may place additional constraints
on the activity and ﬁtness of phototrophs(Hamilton et al., 2011b).
Without sufﬁcient inorganic carbon to serve as the oxidizing agent,
photoautotrophs can become severely photoinhibited, leading to
oxidative stress (Murata et al., 2007) which would decrease ﬁtness
and would presumably place an additional constraint on their dis-
tribution. Indeed, the availability of DIC was inversely correlated
with pH in the sites examined in the present study. A future goal
of this work is to integrate measurements of phototroph in situ
activity, phototroph abundance data, phylogenetic data, and more
detailed geochemical data (e.g., DIC, trace metals, etc.) such that a
comprehensive ﬁtness landscape can be developed for photosyn-
thesis in YNP in order to effectively predict the constraints on the
evolution of this key metabolic process in this early Earth analog
environment.
