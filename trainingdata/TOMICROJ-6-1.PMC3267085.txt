Abstract:  Background  and  Objectives:  Urinary  tract  infections  (UTI)  caused  by  enterohemorrhagic  Escherichia  coli 
(EHEC)  is  one  of  the  most  important  diseases  in  infants  and  children.  If  there  would  not  be  any  useful  diagnosis  and  
treatment it may be resulted in diseases such as acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. The aim of 
this study was to determine frequency of verotoxigenic E.coli isolates in urine of children with (UTIs) in Mofid children 
Hospital.  

Methods: During one year from September 2008 to august 2009, urine specimens were taken from children who suspected 
to  UTI  admitted  to  Mofid  Children  Hospital.  E.coli  strains  that  indicated  beta  hemolytic  on  sheep  blood  agar,  negative 
sorbitol fermentation on SMAC (sorbitol macconky agar) and negative motility on SIM were tested by PCR and serologic 
(VITEC-RPLA kit) methods for detecting toxin genes and production of toxin, respectively.  

Results: Among 12572 urine specimens were taken from children admitted to Mofid hospital, we isolated 378 E.coli from 
urine samples which only 9 isolates were EHEC. Only five EHEC strains (55%) which produced vtx genes, were detected 
by serologic and PCR methods.  

Conclusion: The prevalence of urinary infections caused by EHEC strains is very significant because it causes aggravating 
pathologic  effects. Thus we  suggest rapid method for identification of this bacteria and proper  treatment to Inhibition of 
unwanted complications. 

Keywords: UTI, Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli( EHEC). 

INTRODUCTION 

  Escherichia  coli  is  the  predominant  facultative  anaer-
obe  of  the  human  colonic  flora.  The  organism  typically 
colonizes  the  infant  gastrointestinal  tract  within  hours  of 
life,  and,  thereafter,  E.  coli  and  the  host  derive  mutual 
benefit  [1].Verotoxigenic  Escherichia  coli  (VTEC)  are 
named for their ability  to produce toxins with  a cytopathic 
effect  on  Vero  cells.  They  are  also  referred  to  as  shiga 
toxin-producing  E  coli  (STEC)  because  their  cytotoxins 
closely resemble the shiga toxin produced by Shigella dys-
enteriae  1.  Two  types  of  shiga  toxin  are  produced:  shiga 
toxin  1  (Stx1),  which  is  most  closely  related  to  that  pro-
duced  by  S.  dysenteriae,  and  shiga  toxin  2  (Stx2),  which 
has  several  variants.  Entero-hemorrhagic  E  coli  (EHEC) 
are  the  subgroup  of  VTEC  organisms  with  demonstrated 
human  pathogenicity.  While  most  VTEC  belong  to  E  coli 
serogroup  O157,  verotoxin  production  has  been  identified

in  more  than  200  serogroup  [2].  Hemolytic  uremic  syndrome 
is  the  most  common  cause  of  acute  renal  failure  in  children, 
and  the  incidence  of  this  syndrome  in  children  is  increasing 
worldwide [3]. E. coli O157:H7 is believed to cause more than 
80  percent  of  the  STEC  infections  that  lead  to  hemolytic  ure-
mic  syndrome  [4].  Hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  primarily  oc-
curs  in  children  one  to  10  years  of  age  [5,6]  with  an  average 
annual incidence of one to three cases per 100,000 children [7] 
and a survival rate of nearly 95 percent. Some studies indicate 
that  rural  populations  are  more  at  risk  than  urban  populations 
[8,9]  and  the  incidence  is  higher  in  warmer  months  of  year, 
peaking from June to September [10].  

  Occurrences  may be sporadic or present  as  an outbreak. A 
study conducted  in the United Kingdom, in which confections 
intentionally  were  artificially  contaminated  with  E.  coli 
O157:H7 showed  that  the Shiga  toxin-producing strains  could 
survive  for  as  long  as  one  year,  depending  on  storage  condi-
tions  [11].  Three  to  15  percent  of  persons  who  have  STEC 
with  diarrhea  can  develop  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  [12]. 
Young  children  and  older  persons  with  altered  immune  re-
sponse, [13] as well as persons who have been in contact with 
infected  farm  animals,  are  particularly  vulnerable.  In  addition 
to age, risk factors associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome

included  bloody  diarrhea  fever,  and  elevated  white  blood 
cell  count  and  C-reactive  protein  levels  [14].  The  use  of 
antibiotics  or  antimotility/antidiarrheal  and  antimicrobial 
agents  in  early  stages  of  diarrhea  has  been  shown  to  in-
crease  the  risk  of  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  because  the 
gut  is  exposed  to  a  greater  number  of  toxins  for  a  longer 
period as intestinal motility slows [10, 15]. The pathogen is 
relatively  tolerant  to  acid  and  can  survive  in  fermented 
foods and fresh vegetable produce. 

  Waterborne  transmission  has  also  been  reported,  both 
from  contaminated  drinking-water  and  from  recreational 
waters.  Person-to-person  contact  is  an  important  mode  of 
transmission,  particularly  in  institutional  settings,  such  as 
day care centers, nursing homes and hospitals [16]. Reports 
of EHEC  as a cause of diarrhea in other African  countries 
are  sporadic.  In  a  study  of  childhood  diarrhea  in  Nigeria, 
samples  of  EHEC  were  isolated  from  5.1%  of  children 
with  diarrhea  [17].  A  study  from  Japan  in  1996  by  Japan 
reported  9451  cases  of  EHEC  infections,  1808  of  which 
were  hospitalized  and  12  died;  three-quarters  of  all  these 
cases  occurred  during  six  major  outbreaks.  In  the  largest 
outbreak,  in  SakaiCity,  5727  people  (0.5%  of  the  city's 
population) were  affected, and white radish sprouts served 
at  school  lunch  were  the  most  likely  food  vehicle.  In  out-
breaks  reported  in  other  areas  E.  coli  0157  was  also  iso-
lated from  the salad and seafood sauce that were served at 
school lunches. In 1997, E. coli 0157 was detected in wild 
venison  and  white  radish  sprouts  associated  with  sporadic 
infections  [16].  In  other  parts  of  Asia,  EHEC  infections 
have been reported. In Malaysia, E. coli 0157:H7 has been 
isolated  from  the  stools  of  patients  with  diarrheal  illness 
[18].  In  a  study  at  a  Bangkok  hospital  in  Thailand,  EHEC 
was  identified  in  7%  of  children  with  bloody  diarrhea  in 
whom  other  enteric  pathogens  were  not  identified  [19].  In 
the  Republic  of  Korea,  EHEC  was  isolated  from  1.3%  of 
children with no bloody diarrhea. An investigation into the 
etiology  of  childhood  diarrhea  in  China,  EHEC  isolated 
from 6.8% of children with diarrhea [20].  This article will 
review the diarrheagenic E. coli strains, which include sev-
eral  emerging  pathogens  of  worldwide  public  health  im-
portance,  and  will  specifically  focus  on  pathogens  afflict-
ing humans. We will particularly concentrate on the E. coli 
strain whose study has advanced most over the last decade, 
E.  coli  (EHEC).  The  indications  for  culturing  for  EHEC 
differ  from  those  for  the  rest  of  the  diarrheagenic  E.  coli 
categories.  Routine  screening  test  for  E.  coli  in  urine  are 
most  often  recovered  on  blood  agar  and  eosin  methylene-
blue  agar, which selectively grow members of  the Entero-
bacteriaceae  ,  biochemical  test  such  as  TSI,SIM,  citrate, 
Urease  were  used,  and  also  serologic  test  with  VTEC-
RPLA  latex agglutination kit production of toxin and mul-
tiplex PCR  methods used for identifying vtxB1- and vtxA2 
Phenotypes. 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Clinical Specimens 

  Overall  criteria  for  diagnosis  UTI  was  growth  of  (cid:1)104 
CFU/mL  of  a  urinary  tract  pathogen)  in  patients  who  did 
not  have  another  potential  source  for  their  fever,  a  history 
of UTI, malodorous urine or hematuria, appeared "ill", ab-
dominal or suprapubic tenderness on examination, or fever 

Navidinia et al. 

(cid:1)39°C  [25].  Patients  who  had  received  antibiotic  treatment 
within the preceding 2 weeks, and those with known congenital 
anomalies of urinary tract or central nervous system-associated 
anomalies were excluded. 

 
In  this  "prospective  study"  we  collected  12572  urine  sam-
ples  from  Children  with  UTI  in  Mofid  children  hospital  Te-
hran, Iran /The age of patients ranged between 1-12 years old. 
Samples  were  collected  in  sterile  plastic  containers.  The  sam-
ples  were  inoculated  in  the  Blood  agar  and  EMB.  After  24 
hours  of  incubation  at  37°C  significant  isolated  microorgan-
isms  were  identified  by  using  Gram  stain,  catalase,  oxidase, 
and  other  conventional  tests.  Each  colonies  which  have  (cid:2)-
hemolysis  and  Sorbitol  fermentation  negative  on  SMAC  agar, 
suspected  to EHEC so used  Reverse passive  Latex Agglutina-
tion  Method  for  Detecting  and  Characterizing  Verotoxins 
(Shiga Toxins) in Escherichia coli. 

VTEC-RPLA-SEIKEN 

  A  reverse  passive  latex  agglutination  was  performed  ac-
cording to the Manufacturer’s instructions (No: 230553). 

Collection  of  Samples  and  Preparation  of  Template  DNA 
for PCR 

  A total of 378 E.coli were collected over the periods from 1 
October  2008  to  31  June  2009.  All  bacteria  plated  directly  on 
both  blood  agar  and  SMAC  agar  (Oxoid,  Wesel,  Germany) 
and incubated overnight at 37°C. All colonies suspended to 

  VTEC  were  diluted  in  1  ml  of  Nutrient  broth  with 
15%glycerol.  The  suspension  was  diluted  1:20  in  PCR-grade 
H2O  (Appli-  Chem,  Darmstadt,  Germany);  1/10  was  taken 
from  this  mixture  for  PCR  with  either  a  conventional  instru-
ment [21]. 

Extraction  of  DNA  and  Detection  of  STEC  Strains  by  
(M-PCR) 

  One mL of bacterial  material was suspended  in sterile wa-
ter  and  heated  at  100  °C  during  10  min  to  release  DNA.  PCR 
was  directly  performed  using  consensus  primers  amplifying 
the  toxin  vtx genes  Table  1.  For  each  PCR-positive  sample,  a 
maximum  of  20  colonies  obtained  on  the  MacConkey  agar 
plate was tested separately in order to isolate VTEC strains. 

 
Positive  vtx  consensus  PCR  isolated  colonies  were  subse-
quently  identified  through  biochemical  tests  (indole  produc-
tion,  Klieger  test,  ß-glucuronidase  activity).The  vtx1  and  vtx2 
genes  were  finally  detected  in  sample  isolates  by  the  Multi-
plex-PCR  procedure.  Each  of  the  primers  was  used  at  20  pM, 
with 200 mM each deoxynucleoside triphosphates (Boehringer 
Mannheim,  Meyher,  France),  2.510X  PCR  buffer,  2.5  mM 
MgCl2, and 2 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Denmark). Then, 3 
min  in  95  °C,  35  cycles  including,  denaturation  for  45s  at  94 
°C, primer annealing for 90s at 58 °C, and extension for 90s at 
72 °C and, finally, 7 min incubation at 72 °C in a  Corbett Re-
search  DNA  thermal  cycler  (Corbett,  Australia)  were  applied. 
The  reaction  products  were  then  analyzed  by  electrophoresis 
on  1.2%  agarose  gels  with  1%  ethidium  bromide  (Fermentas, 
Germany).  DNA  from  the  reference  strain,  E.  coli  reference 
VTEC  E.  coli O157:H7  (ATCC;  43895),  and  a  reagent  blank, 
which  contained  all  components  except 
template 
DNA(NTC),  were  included  as  positive  and  negative  controls, 
respectively [22].

chronic  PID  of  100%  -1  suggest  an  absolute  prevalence  and 
also gynaecological condition given an inference of 100% vtx -
1 & 2. Then if, vtx -1 and vtx -1&2 could give such an increas-
ing  prevalence,  then  many  of  these  patients  could  as  well  
be  suffering  from  undiagnosed  life  threatening  hemorrhagic 
colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome [23]. Very scanty 
documentation of E.coli O157:H7 prevalence in UTI and other 
renal  related  diseases  could  not  be  obtained.  Comparation  of 
data  was  not  possible  from  other  part  of  the  country  due  to 
poor documentation.  

 

RESULTS 

Fig.  (1)  shows  the  pattern  and  distribution  of  some 
 
pathogens  caused  UTI.  E.  coli  with  47.2%isolate  had  the 
highest  frequency  followed  with  Klebsiella  oxytoca  with 
147  (18.3%)  isolate.  Staphylococcus  epidermidis  (14.2%), 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.2%), Proteus mirabilis (6.4%) 
and  Staphylococcus  aureus  (4.3%),  respectively.  Approxi-
mately  20.9%  strains  of  E.  coli  which  isolated  from  urine 
were  (cid:1)-hemolytic  E.  coli,  87.67%  were  SMAC  positive 
and 3% were (cid:1)-hemolytic and SMAC positive E. coli were 
ETEC.In  diagram,  as  you  see,  we  found  only  2.3  %  of  E.

DISCUSSION 

  This  study  confirms E.coli  O157:H7  as  one  of  the  ma-
jor causative agent of severe UTI in children. Studies have 
shown that VTEC strain is commonly isolated in hemolytic 
colitis  and  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  belonging  to  
serogroup O157 [23,24,26]. Following this assertion, VTEC 
is  vtx  on  the  increase  in  UTI  subjects  with  16.7%,  while

In  our  study  only  2.3  %  of  E.coli  that  isolated  from  chil-
dren's urine with UTI was Enterohemorrhagic. The prevalence 
of EHEC in Aslani and et al., studies (Institute Pasteur of Iran, 
Tehran  2008  in  stool)  and  Nazek  Al-Gallas  (Tunisia,2007  in 
stool  samples) was 44.5%, 11.1% respectively because EHEC 
is more dominant in stool than urine.  

 
Since  the  detection  of  VT  represents  a  rational,  serotype 
independent  strategy  for  the  diagnosis  of  VTEC  infections, 
simple and reliable procedures that allow the detection of VT. 

 
For  this  purpose,  we  evaluated  the  performance  of  a 
VTEC-RPLA-SEIKEN  assay(An  reverse  passive  latex  agglu-
tination  Vero  Toxigenic  E.  coli,  for  the  detection  and  charac-
terization  of  VTx  s  in  E.  coli  culture  filtrates.  In  this  study, 
44%  of  E.coli  was  non-verotoxigenic  and  56%  was  verotoxi-
gene.  Mohamed  Karmali  and  et  al.,  in  1998  Evaluated  a  Mi-
croplate  Latex  Agglutination  Method  (Verotox-F  Assay)  for 
Detecting  and  Characterizing  of  Verotoxins  (Shiga  Toxins)  in 
Escherichia coli. They examined 68 VT-positive E. coli strains 
and  104  VT-negative  strains  E.  coli  and  conclude  that  the 
Verotox-F assay  is highly  sensitive  and specific for the detec-
tion  and  characterization  of  VTs  in  culture  filtrates  of  human 
E. coli isolates. The test is rapid, reliable, and easy to perform; its 
results are easy to interpret; and it should allow testing for VT 
to  become  more  widely  performed.  We  also  used  a  different 
method of latex agglutination but the same conclusion [27].

stx1 and stx2 while, we had 17/3 % vtx1, 52/45% vtx2 and 
30/3 both vtx1 and vtx2.This significant different percent is 
that  in  our  study  was  on  O157  Shiga  Toxin–Producing

suggest rapid method for identification of this bacteria and
