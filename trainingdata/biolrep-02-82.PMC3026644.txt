Abstract
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a well-established downstream component of the pho-
sphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway but is also a key enzyme in negatively regulating the
canonical Wnt/b-catenin signalling pathway. Several recent studies argue that PKB (protein kinase B)-
mediated inhibition of GSK-3 leads to b-catenin accumulation, but whether cross-talk actually exists
between these two pathways is controversial. To elucidate the mechanisms of shared signalling
components, further studies taking into account different components of the PI3K signalling pathway
and different pools of GSK-3 or b-catenin are required.

Introduction and context
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a constitutively
active and ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine
kinase [1]. In addition to playing a well-defined role in
suppressing the canonical Wnt/b-catenin signalling path-
way [2,3], it functions in Hedgehog, Notch, and several
growth factor signalling pathways [4]. Large amounts of
b-catenin typically are associated with cadherin complexes
at the plasma membrane of adherent cells. However, in
the absence of Wnt signalling, GSK-3 phosphorylates
cytosolic b-catenin within a complex that
includes
adenomatous polyposis coli, Axin-1, casein kinase-1
(CK-1), and other proteins and targets it for ubiquitin-
mediated degradation (Figure 1a). In this manner, very
low levels of non-cadherin-associated b-catenin are main-
tained in the cell. Upon Wnt binding to Frizzled receptors
and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
(LRP) co-receptors and subsequent engagement of the
intracellular protein Dishevelled, the destruction complex
is disrupted, GSK-3 and CK-1 activities are diverted to LRP
co-receptors at the membrane, and cytoplasmic b-catenin
avoids phosphorylation. As a result, b-catenin accumulates
and enters the nucleus to regulate gene expression via
binding to the TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-
binding factor) DNA-binding proteins (Figure 1b).

Physiological levels of GSK-3 do not limit the capacity of
the destruction complex to mediate b-catenin degrada-
tion; only a small percentage (<10%) of the total GSK-3
in the cell
is associated with Axin and engaged in
canonical Wnt signalling [5,6]. Other pools of GSK-3
are additionally used in several other pathways. Upon
insulin stimulation and consequent phosphatidylinosi-
tol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, for example, the serine/
threonine kinase protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt phosphor-
ylates GSK-3 and negatively regulates its kinase activity
(Figure 1c) [7]. A similar mechanism of negative regula-
tion of GSK-3 has been demonstrated in other growth
factor pathways [8-11]. Regulation of b-catenin has also
been demonstrated in many of these pathways [8-12].
However, the direct convergence of Wnt and growth factor
pathways on b-catenin regulation remains a controversial
topic of discussion.

Several human cancers tend to involve separate muta-
tions of both pathways [13]. If PI3K activation were
sufficient to activate Wnt signalling, why would addi-
tional mutations that lead to b-catenin stabilization
be needed? Several studies have also shown that growth
factor stimulation that
leads to GSK-3 inhibition
through PI3K signalling does not result in stabilization

Figure 1. GSK-3 in Wnt and growth factor signalling pathways

(a) In the absence of Wnt signalling, the destruction complex comprised of APC, Axin-1, CK-1, and GSK-3 promotes the phosphorylation and subsequent
ubiquitin-mediated degradation of b-catenin. (b) Upon Wnt stimulation, Dishevelled is engaged, the destruction complex is disrupted, and CK-1 and GSK-3
activities are diverted to LRP at the cell membrane. Unphosphorylated b-catenin may accumulate and enter the nucleus to regulate gene expression upon
binding to TCF/LEF DNA-binding proteins. (c) Upon growth factor stimulation, activation of the PI3K signalling cascade leads to PKB-mediated
phosphorylation of GSK-3 and inhibition of its kinase activity. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CK-1, casein kinase-1; GF, growth factor; GSK-3, glycogen

of b-catenin in the cell [14-16]. Furthermore, GSK-3
molecules that have mutations in the PKB phosphoryla-
tion sites and thus that are insensitive to inhibition by
PI3K signalling are still
inhibited by Wnt signalling
[15-17]. It would appear that, although PI3K and Wnt
signalling pathways share a core regulatory protein, the
insulation of these pathways is sufficient to prevent cross-
talk [18]. As demonstrated by Ng and colleagues [16], Axin
may shield the associated GSK-3 within the destruction
complex from protein kinases (such as PKB) that
otherwise would phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3.
Although GSK-3 that is not directly associated with the
complex may still be phosphorylated and inhibited,
sufficient levels remain bound to the Axin complex to

suppress the accumulation of b-catenin. It should be noted
that chemical
inhibitors of GSK-3 affect all GSK-3
molecules within a cell. Hence, use of such reagents
eliminates any selectivity gained by compartmentalization
of the kinase. This is also true for genetic knockout or RNAi
(RNA interference) suppression of each of
the two
isoforms (GSK-3a and -b), although suppression must
exceed 75-80% to have an impact on b-catenin [17].

Major recent advances
A recent report by Maes and colleagues [11] describes the
effects of induction of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) overexpression in the osteo-chondroprogenitor
cells of adult mice. VEGF overexpression caused vascular

defects, bone marrow fibrosis, hematological abnor-
malities, and increased bone mass, similar to the bone
phenotype observed upon b-catenin overexpression in
the osteo-progenitor cells of mice [19,20]. VEGF over-
expression correlated with increased PI3K signalling via
VEGFR-2 (VEGF receptor-2), leading to enhanced GSK-3
phosphorylation, and the authors also observed b-catenin
stabilization. These results support the idea that receptor
tyrosine kinase-mediated growth factor signals act
through PI3K to induce b-catenin. However, there are
other explanations. Accumulation of b-catenin in the
mouse tissues could be due to indirect activation of
conventional Wnt signalling through induction of Wnt
ligands or modulators. Although the authors show that b-
catenin induction is sensitive to infusion of the PI3K
antagonist wortmannin in the VEGF-expressing mice, this
does not exclude an indirect pathway. Another possible
mechanism is suggested by the known effect of VEGF
promotion of vascular permeability, a process that is
preceded by VEGF-dependent vascular endothelial-
cadherin (VE-cadherin) phosphorylation and dissolution
of
the VE-cadherin complex comprised of adherens
junction proteins p120, b-catenin, plakoglobin, and
a-catenin [21]. Thus, excess levels of cytosolic b-catenin
released from the membrane compartment, together with
increased stress on the destruction complex, may con-
tribute to VEGF-mediated effects on b-catenin stabiliza-
tion. Furthermore, nuclear localization of b-catenin has
been reported to be promoted by PKB phosphorylation
of Ser552 [22]. Clearly,
to exclude
alternative or indirect effects but it is somewhat easier to
assume that
the correlation between PI3K-induced
inhibition of GSK-3 and accumulation of b-catenin is
actually a direct linkage.

it

Future directions
Insulation mechanisms play critical roles in permitting
shared signalling components between pathways yet
maintain the integrity of these pathways and resultant
biological processes. Under normal circumstances, sig-
nalling specificity appears well insulated and can with-
stand precise experimental pressure. However,
these
mechanisms may be overwhelmed by unnatural genetic
and chemical perturbation or by disease mutations.
Furthermore, the insulating mechanisms may not be
relevant in all tissues or cell types. For example, both PKB
and GSK-3 interact with the scaffold protein DISC-1
(disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1) in neurons and this
protein, when overexpressed, has been shown to lead
to accumulation of b-catenin and subsequent signalling
[23-25]. It remains to be seen whether DISC-1 might
mediate cross-talk between the PI3K and Wnt pathways
in a more biologically relevant context since DISC-1
protein levels do not change significantly and the

amount of GSK-3 bound by DISC-1 is only a small
fraction of the cellular total – similar to the amount
associated with Axin – and therefore is unlikely to be
competitive. The small GTPase Cdc42 (cell division
control protein-42 homolog), through its regulation of
the PAR/aPKC (partitioning defective/atypical protein
kinase C) complex, has been proposed to inhibit GSK-3
and stabilize b-catenin in the skin [26]. Activation of Wnt
signalling by aPKC raises questions not unlike those
associated with the effect of PKB on GSK-3 and b-catenin
but also raises the possibility that PI3K may activate
Cdc42 [27,28] and impinge on Wnt signalling in a PKB-
independent manner. To definitively address the
mechanisms and circumstances by which PI3K or other
components of this pathway might impact b-catenin
regulation, future experiments will need to be conducted
with cells or tissues that possess depleted levels of GSK-3
or b-catenin and thus exhibit increased sensitivity to
upstream manipulation of growth factor or Wnt signal-
ling. Under these sensitized conditions, cross-talk may be
more biologically relevant and detectable. Likewise, if
such experiments fail to demonstrate interplay, there
may be greater appreciation of the compartmentaliza-
tion of signalling events under physiological conditions.
Generation of cell lines in which elements of the PI3K
pathway can be rapidly activated (e.g., PKB-estrogen
receptor fusions) should allow investigators to evaluate
whether b-catenin levels are induced within the expected
time frame (b-catenin accumulation requires >30 min-
utes). The potential for different pools of GSK-3 or
b-catenin to supplement each other in the cell must also
be carefully evaluated in such experiments. Importantly,
the dynamics of any observed changes must be taken
into consideration to exclude one pathway from leading
to changes in the levels of agonists and antagonists
of another pathway such as through transcriptional
regulation or micro-RNA expression. There are many
examples of shared components in signalling pathways
with little consideration of distinct pools or mechanisms
to chaperone and isolate fractions of these molecules.
Often, the simplest and most direct path is not taken in
biology, leading to erroneous assumptions and conclu-
sions. Indeed, understanding why a more convoluted
route has been chosen can reveal new discoveries and
previously overlooked components.
