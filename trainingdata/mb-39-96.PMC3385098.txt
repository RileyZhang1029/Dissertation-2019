We  investigated  diet  supplementation  with  shiitake  mushroom  fruiting  bodies  on  biochemical  and  histological  changes  in
hypercholesterolemic  rats.  Six-wk  old  female  Sprague-Dawley  albino  rats  were  divided  into  three  groups  of  10  rats  each.
A  diet  containing  5%  Lentinus  edodes  fruiting  bodies  given  to  hypercholesterolemic  rats  reduced  plasma  total  cholesterol,
triglyceride,  low-density  lipoprotein  (LDL),  total  lipid,  phospholipids,  and  the  LDL/high-density  lipoprotein  ratio  by  34.33,
53.21,  75.00,  34.66,  25.73,  and  71.43%,  respectively.  Feeding  mushroom  also  significantly  reduced  body  weight  in  hyperc-
holesterolemic  rats.  However,  it  had  no  detrimental  effects  on  plasma  albumin,  total  bilirubin,  direct  bilirubin,  creatinine,
blood  urea  nitrogen,  uric  acid,  glucose,  total  protein,  calcium,  sodium,  potassium,  chloride,  inorganic  phosphate,  magnesium,
or  enzyme  profiles.  Feeding  mushroom  increased  total  lipid  and  cholesterol  excretion  in  feces.  The  plasma  lipoprotein  frac-
tion,  separated  by  agarose  gel  electrophoresis,  indicated  that  L.  edodes  significantly  reduced  plasma  β  and  pre-β-lipoprotein
but  increased  α-lipoprotein.  A  histological  study  of  hepatic  cells  by  conventional  hematoxylin-eosin  and  oil  red-O  staining
showed  normal  findings  for  mushroom-fed  hypercholesterolemic  rats.  These  results  suggest  that  shiitake  mushrooms  could
be  recommended  as  a  natural  cholesterol  lowering  substance  in  the  diet.

Lentinus  edodes,  widely  known  as  the  shiitake  mush-
room,  has  an  established  history  of  use  in  time-honored
oriental  therapies.  Modern  clinical  practice  in  Korea,
Japan,  China,  and  other  Asian  countries  continues  to  rely
on  mushroom-derived  preparations.  These  practices  still
form  the  basis  of  modern  scientific  studies  of  mushroom
medicinal  activities  [1].  Eritadenine  is  an  adenosine  ana-
logue  alkaloid  and  lentinacin  is  a  purine  alkaloid  that
reduces  cholesterol  levels  in  rats  by  25%  after  7  days  of
oral  administration  at  doses  as  low  as  0.005%  of  feed
intake  [2].  The  main  cause  of  the  hypocholesterolemic
action  of  eritadenine  seems  to  be  associated  with  a  modi-
fication  in  hepatic  phospholipid  (PL)  metabolism  by
inducing  phosphatylethanolamine  N-methyltransferase  defi-
ciency  [3].  Dietary  eritadenine  also  alters  the  fatty  acid
and molecular profile of the liver and plasma by suppress-
ing  the  metabolic  conversion  of  linoleic  acid  to  arachi-
donic  acid  and  by  decreasing  the  ∆6-desaturase  activity,
which can be affected through transcriptional regulation.

The  microsomal  enzyme  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-
coenzymeA  (HMG-CoA)  reductase  is  the  major  rate-lim-

iting  enzyme  in  cholesterol  biosynthesis,  which  converts
HMG-CoA  to  mevalonate.  Therefore,  inhibiting  HMG-
CoA  reductase  decreases  intracellular  cholesterol  biosyn-
thesis  [4].  Mevinolin  is  a  known  pharmacological  HMG-
CoA  reductase  inhibitor.  A  high  quantity  of  this  inhibitor
has  been  found  in  mushroom  fruiting  bodies,  particularly
in the pileus and sporocarps of Pleurotus ostreatus. Mush-
rooms  also  contain  various  biologically  active  compounds
such  as  gallic  acid,  protocatechuic  acid,  chlorogenic  acid,
naringenin, hesperetin, and biochanin-A [5, 6].

The  fruiting  bodies  of  L.  edodes  lessen  blood  platelet
effectiveness  during  coagulation  and  consequently  those
who  bleed  easily  or  who  take  anticoagulants  should  be
cautious  when  chronically  consuming  L.  edodes  extracts
[7].  Nevertheless,  the  exact  mechanisms  of  action  remain
to be understood before considering a human treatment to
prevent  or  cure  cardiovascular  diseases.  Various  studies
have  shown  that  shiitake  mushrooms  lower  both  blood
pressure  and  free  cholesterol  in  plasma  and  accelerate
lipid  accumulation  in  the  liver  by  removing  them  from
circulation  [8].  The  present  study  was  designed  to  evalu-

ate the dietary effectiveness of L. edodes on plasma, feces,
and hepatic tissue function in hypercholesterolemic rats.

Materials  and  Methods

Mushroom. Fresh  fruiting  bodies  of  L.  edodes  were  pur-
chased  from  E-mart  at  Incheon  in  Korea.  A  pure  culture
was  deposited  in  the  Culture  Collection  and  DNA  Bank
of  Mushroom  (CCDBM),  Division  of  Life  Sciences,  Uni-
versity  of  Incheon,  Korea  and  acquired  accession  num-
ber,  IUM-4681.  Fresh  fruiting  bodies  were  dried  with  hot
air at 40oC for 48 hr and pulverized.

Animals. Thirty  female  Sprague-Dawley  albino  rats  (101
± 4.2 g, 6 wk old, purchased from Central Lab. Animal Inc.,
Seoul, Korea) were used. All animals were acclimated to the
animal  room  for  1  wk.  The  rats  were  housed  in  an  animal
room  at  23 ± 2oC  under  a  12 hr  dark-light  cycle  (17:00~
05:00) and a relative humidity of 50~60%. Rats were divided
into  three  feed  groups:  basal  diet  (normocholesterolemic
control rats; NC), basal diet with 1% cholesterol (hypercho-
lesterolemic  rats;  HC),  and  basal  diet  with  1%  cholesterol
and  5%  L.  edodes  powder  (mushroom-fed  hypercholester-
olemic  rats;  HC + LE).  The  basal  diet  compositions  are
presented in Table 1, and the rats were fed for 42 days.

Plasma  chemical  analysis.  At  the  end  of  the  experimen-
tal  period,  overnight-fasted  animals  were  sacrificed  under
injectable anesthetic (Zoletil 50; Virbac Laboratories, Car-
ros, France). Blood samples were collected with a dispos-
able  plastic  syringe  into  heparinized  tubes.  Plasma  was
obtained by  centrifugation at  2,493 ×g  for  10 min.  Plasma
triglyceride  (TG)  concentration  was  measured  enzymati-

The  composition  of  the  vitamin  mixture  in  the  diet  was  as  follows  (g/

chloride  1.2,  folic  acid  9.5 × 10−2,  vitamin  K  0.25,  cyanocobalamine
9.5 × 10−3,  inositol  47.95,  and  ascorbic  acid  24.0.  The  composition  of
the  mineral  mixture  added  to  the  diet  was  as  follows  (g/100 g  of  min-
eral):  calcium  gluconate  28.5,  K2HPO4  17.3,  CaCO3  26,  MgSO4  12.6,

cally  using  the  glycerophosphate  oxidase  assay.  Plasma
total  cholesterol  (TC),  high-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol
(HDL-C),  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (LDL-C),
very  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (VLDL-C),  total
lipid (TL), and PL levels were measured enzymatically by
the  cholesterol  oxidase  assay  [9]  using  commercially  avail-
able  assay  kits  (Sekisui  Medical  Co.,  Ltd.,  Tokyo,  Japan).
Plasma  albumin,  total  bilirubin,  direct  bilirubin,  creati-
nine, blood  urea nitrogen, uric acid, glucose, total  protein,
and  electrolytes,  including  calcium,  sodium,  potassium,
chloride,  inorganic  phosphate,  and  magnesium  were  mea-
sured  by  standard  methods  using  an  auto  analyzer  (Hita-
chi 7600-210; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).
VLDL-C was calculated as follows:

VLDL-C = [TC − (HDL-C + LDL-C)]

Plasma enzyme analysis. Plasma transaminases, glutamate
pyruvate  transaminase  (GPT),  and  glutamate  oxaloacetate
transaminase  (GOT)  activities  were  determined  using  the
kinetic  method  [9].  Plasma  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP)
activity  was  determined  using  4-nitrophenyl  phosphate.
ALP  catalyzes  the  hydrolysis  of  4-nitrophenyl  phosphate,
forming phosphate  and  free 4-nitrophenol, which is color-
less  in  dilute  acid  solutions.  But,  under  alkaline  condi-
tions,  4-nitrophenol  is  converted  to  the  4-nitrophenoxide
ion,  which  is  an  intense  yellow  color.  The  absorbance  of
this  color  compound  was  measured  spectrophotometri-
cally at 420 nm to determine plasma ALP activity.

Fecal  TL  and  TC  analysis. Feces  were  collected  for  7
days  before  and  at  the  end  of  42  days,  lyophilized,  and
then  milled  into  powder.  TLs  were  extracted  with  chloro-
form/methanol  (2 : 1,  v/v),  according  to  the  method  of
Folch  et  al.  [10].  One  gram  of  fecal  powder  was  mixed
with  10 mL  of  chloroform  and  5 mL  of  methanol  solu-
tion  and  stirred  at  150 rpm  for  3  days  at  room  tempera-
ture. The suspension was filtered through Whatman No. 2
filter paper (Whatman, Maidstone, UK), the methanol was
aspirated, and the chloroform was evaporated. The extracted
lipids  were  then  weighed.  Two  mL  of  H2O  was  added,
and  a  suspension  was  created  using  a  bath  sonicator.  This
suspension was used to estimate fecal cholesterol content by
an enzymatic method using the cholesterol oxidase assay.

Plasma  lipoprotein  separation. Plasma  lipoprotein  frac-
tions were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis [11].
Three  lipoprotein fractions  were  detected  by  electrophore-
sis,  which  will  henceforth  be  referred  to  as  β-lipoprotein
(LDL), pre-β-lipoprotein (VLDL), and α-lipoprotein (HDL).
Sample  application  (2 µL),  electrophoresis  (80 V,  30 min),
staining  (Fat  Red  7B),  drying,  and  densitometric  scanning
(525 nm)  were  performed  automatically  by  the  Helena
TITAN  GEL  lipoprotein  electrophoresis  system  (Helena

98

Yoon  et  al.

Laboratories,  Beaumont,  TX,  USA).  After  electrophore-
sis,  lipoprotein  fractions  were  visualized  with  enzymatic
staining reagents. The visualized gel plate was scanned on
a densitometer, and the lipoprotein scanning patterns were
identified  using  analytical  software  (electrophoresis  data
bank,  K.K.  Helena  Laboratories,  Saitama,  Japan).  The
scanned  patterns  were  divided  into  lipoprotein  fractions
using  the  nadirs  of  the  lipoprotein  sequential  curve.  Lipo-
protein  levels  were  estimated  from  the  area  percentages
and total concentrations.

Histological  analysis  of  liver. Liver  tissues  were  rap-
idly  dissected,  fixed  in  liquid  nitrogen  and  10%  formalin
solution,  and  stored  until  use  at  −80oC.  A  representative
part  of  the  frozen  tissues  was  processed  with  a  cryo
microtome  (Cryotome  FSE  Cryostat;  Thermo  Electron
Corp.,  Cambridge,  MA,  USA)  using  5-µm  thick  section
and  stained  with  oil  red-O  [12].  A  representative  part  of
the  formalin  fixed  liver  tissues  was  processed  for  4-µm
thick  paraffin  embedded  sections  using  a  microtome
(Microtome  HM  450;  Thermo  Electron  Crop.)  and  then
stained  with  hematoxylin  and  eosin.  Both  stained  tissue
samples  were  then  examined  and  photographed  under  a
light  microscope  to  assess  the  presence  of  lipid.  Digital
images  were  obtained  using  an  Olympus  BX51  micro-
scope  equipped  with  a  Camedia  C3040ZOOM  digital
camera  (Olympus  America  Inc.,  Melville,  NY,  USA).  All
images were taken under ×40 magnification.

Statistical  analysis. Results  are  expressed  as  means ±
SDs.  Intergroup  differences  were  analyzed  by  a  one-way
analysis  of  variance  followed  by  post-hoc  tests.  We  used
SPSS  ver.  11.5  (SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  IL,  USA).  A  p ≤
0.05 was considered statistically significant.

19.82,  and  16.14%,  respectively  compared  with  levels  in
NC  rats,  whereas  these  parameters  decreased  significantly
by  34.33,  53.21,  10.43,  75.00,  37.15,  34.66,  and  25.73%,
respectively  in  HC + LE  rats  compared  with  those  in  HC
rats.  The  ratio  of  plasma  LDL  and  HDL  is  shown  in  Fig.
1.  In  HC  rats,  this  ratio  increased  by  8.89%,  compared
with  that  in  NC  rats,  whereas  this  ratio  was  reduced  sig-
nificantly  by  71.43%  in  HC + LE  compared  with  that  in
HC  rats.  The  results  show  that  feeding  5%  L.  edodes  to
rats  significantly  ameliorated  the  plasma  atherogenic  lipid
profiles  in  experimentally  induced  hypercholesterolemic
rats.

Rats  are  particularly  resistant  to  developing  hypercho-
lesterolemia  and  atherosclerosis  [14]  and  have  a  strong
ability to maintain their plasma cholesterol levels [15, 16].
Therefore, to induce hypercholesterolemia or atherosclero-
sis  in  rats,  cholesterol  feeding  is  used  with  other  addi-
tives,  including  bile  acids  and  propylthiouracil  (an  anti-
thyroid drug), which increase intestinal absorption of cho-
lesterol  [17].  However,  in  the  present  study,  adding  1%
cholesterol to the basal diet without bile acids and/or anti-
thyroid  drugs  produced  hypercholesterolemia  in  the  rats,
because cholesterol feeding itself increases bile acid secre-
tion  by  approximately  three  to  four-fold  in  rats  [18].  The
34.33% increase in plasma cholesterol in the hypercholes-
terolemic  rats  in  the  present  study  was  comparable  with
that  reported  by  Bobek  et  al.  [19],  who  fed  rats  choles-
terol (0.3%) diet with added bile acids (0.5%) and showed
a  1.7-fold  higher  cholesterolemia  in  cholesterol-fed  rats
than that in normal rats. In this experiment, feeding 5% L.
edodes to hypercholesterolemic rats significantly repressed
the  increase  in  plasma  cholesterol.  The  mechanism  by
which  mushrooms  reduce  plasma  lipoprotein  levels  in
hypercholesterolemic rats is not clearly understood. Mush-

rooms  contain  the  hypocholesterolemic  agent  mevinolin
[20],  which  may  be  involved  in  decreasing  HMG-CoA
activity  [19],  the  rate-limiting  enzyme  of  cholesterol  bio-
synthesis.  Thus,  feeding  mushrooms  may  involve  sup-
pressing endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting
HMG-CoA reductase activity.

Effects  of  L.  edodes  on  plasma  biochemical  and  elec-
trolyte  function. The  results  of  the  plasma  biochemical
and  electrolyte  concentrations  indicated  that  creatinine,
uric  acid,  glucose,  total  protein,  potassium,  inorganic
phosphate,  and  magnesium  decreased  significantly  in
hypercholesterolemic  rats  by  28.57,  58.33,  18.36,  12.33,
30.66,  37.93,  and  30.55%,  respectively  compared  with
levels  in  mushroom-fed  rats.  Conversely,  no  significant
difference  was  found  for  plasma  albumin,  total  bilirubin,
direct  bilirubin,  blood  urea  nitrogen,  calcium,  sodium,  or
chloride  levels  among  the  normocholesterolemic,  hyperc-
holesterolemic,  and  mushroom-fed  hypercholesterolemic
rats (Table 4).

The  glucose-lowering  effect  of  propionate  is  associated
with  gluconeogenesis  and  the  regulation  of  serum  lipid
levels [21]. A reduction in plasma potassium, sodium, and
chloride concentration is one of  the mechanisms of action
of  antihypertensive  drugs,  particularly  diuretics  [22].  Many
diuretics  act  by  diminishing  sodium  chloride  reabsorption
at  different  sites  in  the  nephrons,  thereby  increasing  uri-
nary  sodium  chloride  and  water  losses,  and  consequently
leading  to  decreased  plasma  levels  of  these  electrolytes.
Antonov  et  al.  [23]  reported  that  plasma  electrolyte  con-
tents  increase  significantly  in  hypertensive  rats.  Impaired
function  of  Na,  K-ATPase,  Na-H  antiport,  which  is  typi-
cal  of  arterial  hypertension,  may  promote  an  increase  in
plasma electrolytes.

Effects  of  L.  edodes  on  plasma  enzyme  profiles. Lower
plasma  GOT,  GPT,  and  ALP  concentrations  were  observed
in  shiitake  mushroom-fed  hypercholesterolemic  rats  than
those  in  normocholesterolemic  rats  (Table  5).  No  signifi-
cant  difference  was  observed  in  the  activities  of  plasma
GOT  and  ALP  in  the  NC,  HC,  or  HC + LE  rats  groups,
whereas  plasma  GPT  activity  was  significantly  higher  in
HC than that in NC rats. Nevertheless, 5% shiitake mush-
room-fed  hypercholesterolemic  rats  revealed  decreased
plasma  GOT,  GPT,  and  ALP  activity  by  6.21,  21.64,  and
6.84%, respectively.

Due  to  the  increasing  frequency  of  antihyperlipidemic
drug use and their common side effects, there is a need to
identify  natural  products  with  few  or  no  side  effects.
Thus,  investigation  continues  to  identify  highly  effective
natural ingredients from foods, such as mushrooms, which
can  decrease  hyperlipidemia  [19, 24].  Previous  studies
have shown that GOT and GPT are typically elevated fol-
lowing  cellular  damage  as  a  result  of  enzyme  leakage
from  the  cells  into  blood  [25].  Therefore,  the  increased
enzyme activities resulting from mushroom treatment may
prevent  oxidative  damage  by  detoxifying  reactive  oxygen
species; thus, reducing hyperlipidemia.

Results  are  means ± SD.  Values  in  the  same  row  that  do  not  share  a

cholesterolemic  rats  increased  significantly  by  2.5  and
3.8-fold,  respectively,  compared  with  those  in  NC  rats
(Table  6).  Thus,  decreased  plasma  cholesterol  may  have
attributed to such a mechanism.

The  higher  level  of  plasma  HDL-C  indicates  that  more
cholesterol  from  peripheral  tissues  was  returning  to  the
liver  for  catabolism  and  subsequent  excretion.  Plasma
VLDL-C  and  TG  contents  in  HC + LE  rats  were  lower
compared with those in hypercholesterolemic rats. VLDL-
C  is  the  major  transport  vehicle  for  TG  from  the  liver  to
extrahepatic  tissues,  whereas  LDL-C  is  not  secreted  as
such  in  the  liver  but  seems  to  be  formed  from  VLDL-C
after  partial  removal  of  TG  by  lipoprotein  lipase  [26].
LDL-C became  the  prime  carrier  for cholesterol  after feed-
ing  cholesterol  to  the  rats,  leading  to  decreased  VLDL-C
and HDL-C content in HC + LE rats.
 
Effects  of  L.  edodes  on  the  plasma  lipoprotein  fraction
by  agarose  gel  electrophoresis. The  α-lipoprotein  band
was  the  fast-moving  fraction  and  was  located  nearest  the
anode.  The  β-lipoprotein  band  was  usually  the  most
prominent  fraction  and  was  near  the  origin,  migrating
only  slightly  toward  the  anode  from  the  point  of  applica-
tion. The pre-β lipoprotein band migrated between α- and
β-lipoprotein (Fig. 2). The effects of feeding L. edodes on
the  plasma  lipoprotein  fraction  are  presented  in  Fig.  3.
The  results  indicated  no  significant  difference  in  the  lipo-
protein  fractions  between  normocholesterolemic  and  mush-
room-fed  hypercholesterolemic  rats  compared  to  those  in
hypercholesterolemic  rats.  The  results  revealed  that  feed-
ing  5%  shiitake  mushrooms  significantly  reduced  plasma
β and pre-β lipoprotein, whereas it increased α-lipoprotein.
The  hypocholesterolemic  effect  of  mushrooms  is  medi-
ated  by  the  interplay  of  a  complex  mixture  of  substances
[27].  Water-soluble  gel-forming  components  of  the  fiber
substance  β-1,3-D-glucan  with  a  low  degree  of  polymer-
ization  and  forming  15~20%  of  dry  matter  interact  with
bile  acids  and  affect  micelle  formation.  Such  substances
might  be  interfering  with  the  absorption  of  cholesterol  in
this manner.

Effects  of  L.  edodes  on  rat  liver  histopathology. The
effect  of  L.  edodes  on  hepatocyte  cells  of  HC  rats  is  pre-
sented in Fig. 4. Liver tissues were stained with hematox-
ylin-eosin and oil red-O. The hepatic cords were typically
arranged  and  located  in  liver  tissue  near  the  central  vein
in the NC, HC, and HC + LE groups. Lipid droplets were
observed  only  in  the  liver  tissue  of  HC  rats,  which  was
attributed  to  lipid  accumulation  in  the  hepatocyte  cell
cytoplasm.

Oxidized  LDL  induces  the  expression  of  scavenger
receptors  on  the  macrophage  surface.  These  scavenger
receptors  promote  the  accumulation  of  modified  lipopro-
teins,  forming  an  early  atheroma.  The  histological  results

indicated  that  the  liver  tissues  of  the  5%  HC + LE  rats
were  almost  similar  to  those  of  NC  rats  and  that  the
hepatic  biosynthesis  of  cholesterol  was  suppressed,  which
may  have  been  due  to  a  reduction  in  HMG-CoA  activity
[28].  Hyperlipidemia  is  the  leading  risk  factor  for  athero-
sclerosis,  but  the  atherosclerotic  pathological  process
could  be  slowed  or  reversed  by  reducing  serum  LDL,
TGs, and PLs  and increasing serum HDL.  Several studies
have  demonstrated  a  protective  effect  of  HDL  in  athero-
sclerosis  and  cardiovascular  disease,  whereas  high  levels
of  LDL  constitute  a  risk  factor.  Excess  LDL  in  the  blood
is  deposited  on  the  blood  vessel  walls  and  becomes  a
major component of atherosclerotic plaque lesions, whereas
HDL  facilitates  translocation  of  cholesterol  from  periph-
eral  tissues,  such  as  arterial  walls,  to  the  liver  for  catabo-
lism  [29].  Bobek  and  Galbavý  [30]  observed  that  oyster
mushrooms  prevent  the  formation  of  atheromatous  plaques
and  reduce  the  incidence  and  extent  of  atherosclerotic
