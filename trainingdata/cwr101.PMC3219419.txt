Understanding microsecond-timescale dynamics is crucial
structure–activity
to establish three-dimensional
relationships in sugars but has been intractable to exper-
iments and simulations. As a consequence, whether argu-
ably the most important chemical scaffold in glycobiology,
N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), deviates from a rigid
4C1 chair is unknown. Here, conformer populations and
exchange kinetics were quantiﬁed from the
longest
aqueous carbohydrate simulations to date (0.2 ms total) of
GlcNAc, four derivatives from heparan sulfate and their
methylglycosides. Unmodiﬁed GlcNAc took 3–5 μs
to
reach a conformational equilibrium, which comprised a
metastable 4C1 chair that underwent 4C1 ↔ 1C4 transitions
at a predicted forward rate of 0.8 μs−1 with an average
1C4-chair lifetime of 3 ns. These predictions agree with
high-resolution crystallography and nuclear magnetic res-
onance but not with the hypothesis that GlcNAc is a rigid
4C1 chair, concluded from previous experimental analyses
and non-aqueous modeling. The methylglycoside was cal-
culated to have a slower forward rate (0.3 μs−1) and a
more stable 4C1 conformer (0.2 kcal mol−1), suggesting
that pivotal 3D intermediates (particularly 2SO, 1S5 and
B2,5) increased in energy, and water was implicated as a
major cause. Sulfonation (N-, 3-O and 6-O) signiﬁcantly
augmented this effect by blocking pseudorotation, but did
not alter the rotational preferences of hydroyxl or hydro-
xymethyl groups. We therefore propose that GlcNAc
undergoes puckering exchange that
is dependent on
polymerization and sulfo substituents. Our analyses, and
3D model of the equilibrium GlcNAc conformer in water,
can be used as dictionary data and present new opportu-
nities to rationally modify puckering and carbohydrate
bioactivity, with diverse applications from improving crop
yields to disease amelioration.

Understanding carbohydrate three-dimensional (3D) structure–
activity relationships (SARs) is a difﬁcult but critical mile-
stone in glycomics. Elucidating molecular details of glycan
equilibrium 3D structure, presently in its infancy, are central
to realizing accurate SARs and will enable rational exploita-
tion of the vast medicinal and industrial potential of polysac-
charides.
of
N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) is ubiquitous and mediates
some of
important processes in glycobiology.
Consequently, establishing SARs in GlcNAc and its deriva-
tives will engender innumerable opportunities to impact some
of the most challenging scientiﬁc problems of our time. For
example, as well as being a versatile scaffold for novel drug
discovery (Wang et al. 2009), chemically modiﬁed GlcNAc is
present in chitin and glycosaminoglycans, which hold great
potential as novel biomaterials and medicines (Gama et al.
2006; Murrey and Hsieh-Wilson 2008; Khoushab and
Yamabhai 2010).

the most

scaffold

The 3D structures of GlcNAc polysaccharides are deﬁned
by two dynamic conformational determinants: glycosidic
linkage geometry and pyranose ring conformation (or pucker).
Nanosecond gycosidic-linkage dynamics are better understood
because they are amenable to study by both nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and simulation. However,
while puckering is central to glycobiology, e.g. ribose differs
from deoxyribose by having different equilibrium confor-
mations (Rich 2003), whether substituents affect the ensemble
of pyranose ring conformers remains enigmatic because
exchange occurs on microsecond timescales, which has been
problematic for NMR and simulations, until recently (Sattelle
et al. 2010).

There is circumstantial experimental evidence to suggest
that pyranoses, such as glucose and GlcNAc (considered to
exist as exclusively stable 4C1 chairs), are not as stable as
once thought. For example, atomic force microscopy has
inferred that glucose polymers contain non-4C1 geometries
(Marszalek et al. 1998; Heymann and Grubmuller 1999; Li
et al. 1999), and non-4C1 GlcNAc is observed in high-
resolution
diverse
(non-enzyme) protein co-complexes (Ikemizu et al. 1999;
Chang et al. 2003; Maveyraud et al. 2009; Xu et al.
2010). Furthermore, studies have also shown that appar-
ently stable 4C1 chairs can be perturbed by chemical modi-
ﬁcations, e.g. glucuronic acid (β-D-GlcA) deviates from a
4C1 chair in fully O-sulfonated chondroitin and hyaluronan
(Wessel and Bartsch 1995; Maruyama et al. 1998; Toida
et al. 1999, 2000).

While NMR would be an ideal technique to explore these
observations, puckering exchange occurs on the microsecond
timescale, which is fast-enough to ensure that standard exper-
iments cannot discriminate between conformers (resonances
represent “average” puckers) and interpretation of anything
but the simplest situation is difﬁcult. Under ideal conditions,
using scalar couplings, the minimum percentage of percepti-
ble conformers is around 10%. Simulations are crucially
important in this microsecond “blind spot,” but have not been
routinely possible with explicit solvent due to lack of proces-
sing power (most previous simulations are <100 ns). Recently,
implementation of molecular dynamics (MD) programs to run
on graphics processing units have made it possible to perform
deterministic unperturbed explicit solvent
simulations on
microsecond timescales (Harvey et al. 2009; Klepeis et al.
2009). Extended molecular mechanics studies are currently
restricted to single chemistries but have recently revealed
biologically relevant
into carbohydrate puckering
populations and exchange kinetics (Sattelle et al. 2010).
Measurements from NMR (e.g. pyranose ring vicinal coup-
lings) can then be usefully applied to test the simulations.

in
GlcNAc-containing
by
heparan sulfate (HS) and structurally related heparin (Powell
et al. 2004; Lamanna et al. 2007; Turnbull 2010). Localized
in the extracellular matrix, HS mediates of some of the most
important processes in biology, e.g. neuronal development
(Zhu et al. 2010), anticoagulation (Liu and Pedersen 2007)
and angiogenesis (Sasisekharan et al. 2002). In vivo, hetero-
geneous HS polymers of variable length are bound to proteins
via rigid sulfonated (S-)domains (Bishop et al. 2007), which
are ﬂanked by ﬂexible unsulfonated (NA-)regions (Mobli
et al. 2008). The monosaccharides GlcA and GlcNAc com-
prise the disaccharide repeat in NA domains, while sulfonated
derivatives of α-L-iduronic acid (IdoA) and GlcNAc predomi-
nate in S-domains; IdoA can be 2-O-sulfonated (IdoA2S) and
GlcNAc can be N-, 6-O- and 3-O-sulfonated, leading most
commonly to GlcNS, GlcNS6S, GlcNS6S3S and GlcNS3S
(Figure 1). Anticoagulant heparin is one of the oldest and
most widely used natural product drugs; synthetic alternatives
are highly desirable due to clinical dangers associated with
impure material (Liu et al. 2009). Heparin potency is depen-
dent on the charged carboxyl and sulfo substituents of its
uronic acid and hexosamine residues (Hricovini et al. 2001;
Avci et al. 2003). Puckering is also a key contributor, the
protein antithrombin (ATIII) binds the 2SO pucker of the
heparin IdoA2S residue (Hricovini et al. 2001) and derivatives
exhibiting 2SO-biased IdoA2S are highly efﬁcacious (Das
et al. 2001; Boltje et al. 2009). Exactly how different sulfona-
tion patterns impart functional diversity in HS and heparin
remains unclear; however,
they are well characterized and
therefore provide excellent model systems for chemically
modiﬁed carbohydrates in general.

GlcNS3S as free α-anomers and methylglycosides. Our ﬁnd-
ings suggested that in water, despite being a metastable 4C1
chair, the GlcNAc pyranose ring explores the majority of con-
formational
and
undergoes microsecond-
timescale 4C1 ↔ 1C4 puckering,
the kinetics of which are
modiﬁed by substituents. These predictions were consistent
with our observations from NMR and the Protein Data Bank
that non-4C1 GlcNAc puckers are
(PDB), which suggest
important in protein interactions. The simulations complete
our computational studies of equilibrium puckering for the
major hexosamine and uronic acid (Sattelle et al. 2010) con-
stituents of HS. They also provide fundamental information to
the wider glycobiology ﬁeld by demonstrating the great poten-
tial of extended unperturbed aqueous simulations to facilitate
rational modiﬁcation of carbohydrate puckering kinetics and
concomitant bioactivity. Our detailed analysis and 3D model
of the equilibrium GlcNAc conformation in water can be used
to drive the development of novel biotechnologies.

the monosaccharides
GlcNAc, GlcNS, GlcNS6S, GlcNS6S3S and GlcNS3S as free
reducing sugars (the α-anomer) and α-1-O-methylglycosides
(1-OMe). The simulations were initiated in both the 4C1 and
1C4 chairs and performed for 10 µs each. Thermodynamic
equilibrium was conﬁrmed by comparing averages of the
Cremer–Pople θ-parameter (Sattelle et al. 2010); when con-
vergence had occurred, both simulations (a total of 20 μs)
were used in further analysis.

In this study, we aim to explore the equilibrium populations
and exchange kinetics of GlcNAc puckers and also the effects
of sulfo substituents and methylglycosides on them. The most
extensive all-atom explicit solvent carbohydrate simulations to
date were performed (0.2 ms in total), and experimentally
validated, for GlcNAc, GlcNS, GlcNS6S, GlcNS6S3S and

Microsecond-conformational exchange in GlcNAc
In the GlcNAc simulations, equilibrium of ring pucker was
realized within 3–5 μs. As expected, the 4C1 chair was the
dominant conformer, present for 99.6% of the trajectory. The
average Cremer–Pople puckering parameters for these 4C1

conformers were: Q = 0.54 (±0.04) and θ = 10.1° (±5.5°). The
hydroxyl groups were calculated to have the following prefer-
ences: O1 (t, 69%; g+, 19%; g−, 12%), O3 (t, 65%; g+,
22%; g−, 13%), O4 (t, 71%; g+, 18%; g−, 11%) and O6
(t, 67%; g+, 20%; g−, 13%). The hydroxymethyl populated
the gg (59%), gt (39%) and tg (2%) conformers and the aceta-
mido group was trans (165 ± 25°). For comparison, the exper-
imental hydroxymethyl rotamer populations were estimated
from the two experimental measurements
(J5,6proR and
J5,6proS, Table I) and a three-site model to be: gg (96%), gt
(4%) and tg (0%).

Ring and acetamido vicinal couplings of the free reducing
GlcNAc α-anomer were accurately measured from 900 MHz
[1H]-1D NMR spectra in water. The 3J2,3, 3J3,4,3J4,5 and
3JHN,H2 values were in the range 8–10 Hz, the 3J1,2 coupling
was (cid:1)3 Hz (Table I). Compared with experimental values, the
computed ring vicinal couplings 3J1,2 and 3J2,3 were smaller,
3J3,4 was identical and 3J4,5 and 3JHN,H2 were greater in mag-
nitude. Computed values of 3J5,6 were also very similar to
NMR measurements, one being smaller and one larger. Since
the calculated values were all within 1 Hz of experiment and
the deviations were not systematic, errors could be assumed to
propagate from either the Karplus equations used or the
force-ﬁeld parameters (less likely as these would be expected
to be systematic across sets of couplings). Calculation of ring
vicinal couplings from only GlcNAc 4C1 conformers (99.6%
of
results. This comparison

the trajectory) gave identical

chairs

involved

predominantly

All of the 4C1 hemisphere and boat and skew boat (equator-
ial) canonical puckers were populated in the simulation of
GlcNAc. Although the 4C1 pucker was dominant, the 1C4 chair
was also transiently occupied, with averages Q = 0.52 (±0.04)
and θ = 166.3° (±6.5°). The computed pathway between the

↔ 1S3 ↔ 1S5 ↔ 5H4 ↔ 1C4; however, 27 of the 36 canonical
non-chair puckers were populated (Figure 2). A total of 16
4C1 → 1C4 transitions were observed (Figure 3), occurring at a
computed (forward) rate of 0.8 μs−1. The average lifetime of
the GlcNAc 1C4-chair puckers was (cid:1)3 ns, giving a 1C4 → 4C1
(backward) rate of 292 μs−1 and an equilibrium constant of
Keq = 2.9 × 10−3 (assuming ﬁrst-order kinetics). Using the
simulated equilibrium data, the GlcNAc 4C1 chair was lower in
free energy than the 1C4 chair, by ΔG = 3.5 kcal mol−1. The
dominant non-chair puckers in the 4C1 hemisphere were half-
chairs and envelopes with either C2 up or C3 down (2H3, 2E,
2H1 and E3). Three transition states between skew boats and
the 1C4 chair were predicted; namely, the unstable envelopes
and half-chair conformers E4, 5H4 and 5E. Representative 3D
structures of the key 4C1- and 1C4-hemisphere intermediates
from the simulation are illustrated in Figure 4. Transition to the
2SO-conformer allowed facile pseudorotation in the equatorial
region. The primary boat and skew boat puckers were those
with w-values in the range 150–330°; the most populated were
2SO, B3,O, 1S3 and OS2 (Figure 5). However, conversion to the
1C4 chair occurred from the much less populated 1,4B, 1S5 and
B2,5 conformers (Figure 6).

The effect of 1-O-methylation: a model for polymerization
Simulations of 1-OMe-GlcNAc reached a conformational
equilibrium after (cid:1)3–5 μs. Consistent with the free reducing
α-anomer simulation, a range of puckers were predicted (28
of the 36 non-chair canonical conformers, Figure 2) with the
4C1 chair as the major conformer. The average 4C1 pucker for
1-OMe-GlcNAc had values of Q = 0.56 (±0.04) and θ = 9.7°
(±5.3), similar to GlcNAc. Five 4C1 → 1C4 transitions were
predicted and their computed pathway was similar to that of
the free α-anomer; however, differences in the population of
conformers were predicted (Figure 6B). Neighboring the 4C1
pucker, envelopes and half-chairs with either O5 up or C1
down (OE, OH1, E1 and 2H1) were more populated in the
1-OMe-GlcNAc simulation. Those with C2 up or C3 on
down (2E, 2H3, E3 and 4H3) and with C4 up or C5 down
(4E, 4H5, E5 and OH5) were less populated than in GlcNAc.
This trend in equatorial conformer populations was identical
to GlcNAc; however, all puckers except 1S3 were less popu-
lated. In particular, the population of B2,5 was almost pre-
cluded by the 1-O-methylsubstitution (Figures 2 and 6B). In
the 1C4 hemisphere, compared with the GlcNAc simulation,
the envelope E4 was less populated, 5H4 was more populated
and 5E was absent
in the methylglycoside simulation.
Calculated orientations of the hydroxyl, hydroxymethyl and
acetamido groups were identical
to those computed for

GlcNAc. In contrast,

146 μs−1, respectively, which resulted in a calculated equili-
brium constant of Keq = 1.9 × 10−3. Using this equilibrium
data, the 4C1 chair was calculated to be ΔG = 3.7 kcal mol−1
lower in free energy than the 1C4 chair. Therefore, the two
chair conformers in GlcNAc and 1-OMe-GlcNAc had similar
equilibria and relative free energies, but methylation slowed
the conformational exchange kinetics.

Quantum mechanical (QM) energy calculations were per-
formed to further explore the relative energies of the chair
puckers and the energy barriers separating them,
in the
absence of explicit solvent. The GlcNAc 4C1 pucker was pre-
dicted by QM to be 19.1 kcal mol−1 lower in energy than the
1C4 conformer and the lowest energy equatorial pucker, 1S3
(w= 213°), was 11.4 kcal mol−1 above the 4C1 chair. For
1-OMe-GlcNAc, the two chairs were separated by 16.8 kcal
mol−1 and the lowest energy equatorial pucker, 1S5 (w= 270°),
was 11.4 kcal mol−1 above the 4C1 pucker energy. The QM
calculations trended in agreement with the MD simulations
with respect
likely predicted pathway of
4C1 ↔ 1C4 exchange. The magnitude of predicted relative
energies was
in MD than QM calculations and
inclusion of implicit solvent exacerbated the disagreement
(the energy difference between chairs increased to 21.6 and
20.3 kcal mol−1 for GlcNAc and 1-OMe-GlcNAc, respect-
ively). Furthermore, QM predicted the 2SO pucker (abundantly
populated in aqueous simulations) to be the highest energy
equatorial pucker (30 kcal mol−1 above the 4C1 chair energy)
in both GlcNAc and 1-OMe-GlcNAc.

The effects of sulfonation on microsecond dynamics
In the case of GlcNS (N-sulfonated free α-anomer), the simu-
lations equilibrated to an essentially 100% 4C1 conformation
(Figure 7A), which had an average pucker of Q = 0.55 (±0.04)
and θ = 9.5° (±5.2). When initiated in the 1C4 pucker, the
molecule rapidly exchanged to the 4C1 chair (during the 250

perturb the distribution of rotamer states at the hydroxyl and
hydroxymethyl groups (cf. GlcNAc) and the N-sulfonyl occu-
pied three distinct acetamido rotamer states, centered on +60,
−90 and −160°. Computed and experimental pyranose ring
vicinal couplings were in excellent agreement. As
for
GlcNAc, all calculated values were within 1 Hz of the exper-
imentally measured value (Table I). In contrast to the GlcNAc
simulation, only a small number of canonical puckers were
observed other than 4C1 (Figure 2); the most populated of
these were the envelopes and half-chairs with C2 up (2E, 2H1
and 2H3). The only GlcNS boats and skew boats had w-values
in the rather limited range 90–150°, which were 5S1, 2SO, 2,5B
and B1,4. No transition states were predicted between these
puckers and the (unpopulated) 1C4 chair. For 1–OMe-GlcNS,
the 1C4-initiated trajectory remained in the 1C4 chair for
several hundred nanoseconds. During the remaining simu-
lation time, no transitions were observed from 4C1 to 1C4.
Thus,
the kinetic rate for exchange
between the two chair forms had been slowed signiﬁcantly

the
GlcNS 4C1 chair and the equatorial B2,5 pucker (w= 300°)
were predicted by QM to be energetically degenerate, which
was at odds with the explicit solvent MD simulations.
The 1,4B conformer (w= 240°) was just 1.6 kcal mol−1 above
the 4C1 chair and three 4C1-hemisphere puckers (with θ in the
range 150–170° and win the range 240–270°) were computed
by QM to be within 3.0 kcal mol−1 of the 4C1 chair.

In the case of the GlcNS6S free α-anomer, this molecule
was predicted to be a stable 4C1 chair with average Q- and
θ-values of 0.55 (±0.04) and 9.5° (±5.2), respectively. In the
4C1-initiated simulation of GlcNS6S, a single 4C1 ↔ 1C4 tran-
sition occurred after (cid:1)6 μs (Figure 6C), in which the 1C4
chair was populated for (cid:1)160 ns. Thus,

remained at 3 × 10−3,

exchange rate was estimated to be (cid:1)6 μs−1. Assuming the
equilibrium constant
the rate of
4C1 ↔ 1C4 conformational exchange was estimated to be (cid:1)50
times slower in GlcNS6S than in GlcNAc, suggesting a
forward rate of 0.02 μs−1 and explaining why so few tran-
sitions had been observed within even 20 μs. This ﬁnding
also suggested that
the activation free energy barrier was
increased in GlcNS6S (cf. GlcNAc) by (cid:1)2.3 kcal mol−1.
Although the non-equilibrium GlcNS6S simulations precluded
calculation of the relative energy between chairs, prediction of
an accessible 4C1 ↔ 1C4 pathway in the 4C1-initiated trajec-
tory allowed further investigation by QM. The prediction that
the two conformers and the equatorial B2,5 pucker (w= 300°)
had the same energy was at odds with the MD simulations, in
which B2,5 was rather minimally populated compared with the
5S1 and 2SO conformers (w= 90 and 150°, respectively), both
of which were predicted to be very unfavorable by QM (>30
kcal mol−1 above the 4C1-chair energy).

For 3-O-sulfonated GlcNS3S and GlcNS6S3S, only the 4C1
conformer was observed (Figure 7B and C). Again, exchange
from the 1C4 pucker occurred rapidly during the equilibration
phase. Average Q-values for the 4C1 conformers of these hex-
osamines were identical, 0.56 (±0.04), and the θ-values were
9.5 (±5.2) and 9.6 (±5.3) for GlcNS3S and GlcNS6S3S,
respectively. All of the di- and tri-sulfonated hexosamines had
computed vicinal couplings within 1 Hz of the measured
value (Table I) with two exceptions, 3J2,3 of GlcNS6S and
3J4,5 of GlcNS3S, which were smaller than the corresponding
experimental data by 1.2–1.6 Hz, suggesting that the abun-
dance of sulfate groups had made the general Karplus
the hydroxyl rotamer
equations used less accurate. Again,
states and hydroxymethyl conformations were identical
in
GlcNS3S and GlcNS6S3S compared with unsulfonated
GlcNAc. In the 3–O-sulfonated GlcNS3S and GlcNS6S3S
simulations, the N-sulfonyl group was different from GlcNS,
being predicted to populate only two rotamer states (+60 and
−160°), rather than the three found in GlcNS.

None of the 4C1- or 1C4-initiated sulfonated methylglycoside
simulations reached conformational equilibrium. This was
attributed to the extended time taken for the 1C4-initiated trajec-
tories to undergo the 1C4 → 4C1 exchange. The 1C4-pucker life-
time was correlated with the degree of sulfonation and estimated
to be: 1-OMe-GlcNAc (<250 ns), 1-OMe-GlcNS (600 ns),
1–OMe-GlcNS3S (1.2 μs), 1-OMe-GlcNS6S (2.8 μs)
and
1-OMe-GlcNS6S3S (5.7 μs). A lifetime of 5 μs corresponds to
a back transition rate of 0.2 μs−1 or (cid:1)1000 times slower than in
GlcNAc. Assuming the equilibrium constant was similar to
GlcNAc, this equates to an increase in activation energy of
(cid:1)4.1 kcal mol−1. For the 4C1-initiated simulations, which did
not populate any 1C4-hemisphere puckers, increased sulfonation
resulted in an increased population of 4C1-hemisphere envelopes
and half-chairs. The 2H1 half-chair was the most populated
intermediate in all 4C1-initiated simulations and envelopes E1
and 2E were the next most populated. Only boats and skew
boats with w-values in the range 60–150° (B1,4, 5S1, 2,5B and
2SO) were occupied. Here,
the 5S1 conformer of 1-OMe-
GlcNS6S3S was signiﬁcantly more stable than in any of the
other sulfonated methylglycosides. In the 1C4-initiated trajec-
tories, the distribution of transition states between skew boats

1656

and the 1C4 chair was similar for the mono- and di-sulfonated
hexosamines. However, for 1-OMe-GlcNS6S3S, the puckers
5H4 and 5E were much more populated. At the equator, puckers
with w-values in the range 270–330° (1S5, B2,5 and OS2) were
occupied by all of the sulfonated methylglycosides, although
the 1S3 and 1,4B conformers were comparatively inaccessible
to 1-OMe-GlcNS6S3S. The 1-OMe-GlcNS and 1–OMe-
GlcNS6S3S 1C4-initiated simulations were predicted to populate
B2,5 and OS2 almost equally and much more so than in
1-OMe-GlcNS6S and 1-OMe-GlcNS3S.

In the di- and tri-sulfonated free reducing and methylglyco-
side hexosamines (1C4-initiated trajectory), the sulfo moieties
rearranged during the single transition to the favored 4C1
pucker. This transition brings all of the sulfo groups from the
axial to the equatorial position with a consequent increase in
the distance from the 6-O-sulfo to both N- and 3-O-sulfo. For
example, in 1–OMe-GlcNS6S3S, these distances increased on
average by (cid:1)1 Å (Figure 8) and the distance between the
adjacent N- and 3-O-sulfo moieties decreased slightly follow-
ing the transition. These observations indicate that solvation
forces and electrostatic repulsion between sulfo groups play
an important role in favoring the 4C1 pucker over 1C4.

Analysis of crystallographic data
In an analysis of crystallographic high-resolution (≤2.0 Å) PDB
GlcNAc depositions, 96.9% of the 3137 occurrences were in
the 4C1 conformation. However, 0.5% were 1C4 puckers and
2.6% were boats or skew boats, such as in the non-enzyme
structures
and
interlukin-19 (Ikemizu et al. 1999; Chang et al. 2003;
Maveyraud et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2010). For the 4C1 conformers,
average puckering parameters were Q = 0.57 and θ = 9.1°; in the
1C4 conformers, the averages were Q = 0.59 and θ = 163°. For
reference, average values from our simulations were as follows:
4C1 puckers: Q = 0.54 (±0.04), θ = 10.1° (±5.5°); and 1C4
puckers: Q = 0.52 (±0.04), θ = 166°
(±6.5°). From the
Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), the two entries for free
α-D-GlcNAc [ACGLUA10 (Johnson 1966) and ACGLUA11
(Mo and Jensen 1975)] are 4C1 chairs; they exhibit Q-values of
0.62 and 0.58, with respective θ-values of 7.6 and 3.1°. In the
recent 1 Å resolution crystal structure of chitin (Nishiyama et al.
2011), the GlcNAc θ parameter is identical to the simulation
4C1 average (10°). Sulfonated hexosamines were also found in
these repositories. For GlcNS6S, 16 ligands were identiﬁed in
13 crystallographic PDB depositions (≤2.0 Å resolution), 12
were 4C1 chairs, 3 were 1C4 chairs and 3 were equatorial confor-
mers. Average puckering parameters in the 4C1 conformers were
Q = 0.59 and θ = 10.3°; our computed data for this GlcNS6S
pucker were Q = 0.55 (±0.04) and θ = 9.5° (±5.2°). In the CSD,
two GlcNS molecules were identiﬁed [ZULPIF (Ojala et al.
1995) and ZULPIF01 (Yates et al. 1995)], which exist as 4C1
chairs and have Q-values of 0.56 and 0.55 and θ-values 4.0 and
2.9°, respectively.

crystals devoid of water and protein, were slightly more rigid
than our predictions. The trend for non-4C1 puckers of
GlcNAc in the PDB and our simulations was similar. Our
comparisons of calculated and experimental data provide con-
ﬁdence that the simulated puckering was representative of real
conformational exchange in GlcNAc and its derivatives.
Furthermore, these similarities support the view that, while
GlcNAc exists predominantly as a 4C1 chair in water, other
puckers may be biologically important, particularly in unsul-
fonated GlcNAc.

Our QM data of GlcNAc conformers (without explicit
solvent) were consistent with previous studies, such as those
of glucose (Barrows et al. 1995; Appell et al. 2004), but in
general provided larger relative chair energies than MD and
also predicted a different set of boat and skew boat intermedi-
ates. However,
it should be noted that energies computed
without water may be sensitive to small geometrical pertur-
bations due to unnatural intramolecular hydrogen bonding and
the large relative QM energies may be a consequence of this.
For example, QM predicted GlcNAc to be a rigid 4C1 chair,
whereas MD suggested the barrier height was (cid:1)5 times the
thermal energy at room temperature, which is in close agree-
ment with many other studies of pyranoses (Dowd et al.
1994; Barnett and Naidoo 2010; Barnett et al. 2010; Spiwok
et al. 2010). The ﬁnding that the majority of conformational
phase space was computed to be accessible in GlcNAc,
including the 1C4 chair, also challenges the notion that
GlcNAc is rigid. We now propose that aqueous GlcNAc
undergoes microsecond-timescale conformational exchange,
which would not be concluded from straightforward interpret-
ation of NMR vicinal couplings, sub-microsecond unequili-
brated MD and gas-phase QM energy calculations. Whether
similar conclusions would be made for other biologically
important hexosamines, such as N-acetyl-D-galactosamine,
remains to be seen.

The hypothesis that GlcNAc undergoes room-temperature-
accessible microsecond
transitions
(separated by ΔG = 3.5 kcal mol−1) that are consistent with
protein co-crystals, but which cannot be predicted by gas phase
or implicit solvent QM calculations (in which the chair forms
were predicted to be 19.1 kcal mol−1 different), suggests a
major role for water in stabilizing the ensemble of GlcNAc
puckers. It has been theorized that water is essential to predict
carbohydrate conformation (Kirschner and Woods 2001) and
our data concurs. As concluded previously (Sattelle and
Almond 2010), we again found that extensive empirical simu-
lations were preferential to restricted studies at higher levels of
theory for carbohydrates, due to their ability to resolve micro-
second dynamics. Figure 9 illustrates the 3D structure of
GlcNAc with the pucker and substituents in the most fre-
quently encountered conformation in the 20 µs simulation.
This 3D model (available as Supplementary data) could be
used as 4C1-dictionary data for structural reﬁnement, protein
docking or structure-based design.

In the absence of unambiguous atomic-resolution exper-
imental data and extended aqueous simulations,
it has not
been possible to robustly quantify equilibrium conformer
populations or the kinetics of puckering exchange at the mol-

may differ, this ﬁnding suggests that previous (nanosecond)
GlcNAc simulations explored only a small fraction of con-
formational phase space. Consequently, previous thermo-
dynamic and kinetic interpretations of simulated GlcNAc
puckering should be treated with caution. Importantly,
the
predicted microsecond-timescale exchange between GlcNAc
chair puckers was not in disagreement with NMR measure-
ments reported here (Table I) and elsewhere (Mulloy and
Johnson 1987; Jin et al. 2009).

Average Q- and θ-values for chair puckers of GlcNAc and
GlcNS6S from the simulations were similar to their respective
values derived from the PDB, whereas GlcNAc was identical
to a 1 Å resolution 3D structure of chitin (Nishiyama et al.

Neither the methylglycoside nor the N- or O-sulfo deriva-
tive was predicted to alter the rotational preferences of hydro-
yxl or hydroxmethyl groups. The simulations suggested that
the effect of these substituents was instead to add steric bulk
and charge, and hence to modify pyranose ring puckering.
The methylglycoside has previously been shown to inﬂuence
pyranose conformation (Marszalek et al. 1998; Heymann and
Grubmuller 1999; Li et al. 1999), and this reinforces our
thesis that knowledge of equilibrium populations and kinetics
are crucial for a complete understanding of carbohydrate 3D
SARs. For example, the slower rate of 4C1 → 1C4 transition in
1-OMe-GlcNAc (three times cf. GlcNAc) implied a 0.4 kcal
mol−1 increase in activation energy. This was found to be due
intermediates in
to the relative inaccessibility of several
2SO,
1-OMe-GlcNAc,
and B2,5
(Figures 2 and 6), indicating a higher-energy barrier to pseu-
dorotation. Sulfonation further increased this energy barrier,
making it more difﬁcult for the 1C4-initiated methylglycosides

The equilibrium of GlcNS puckers was shifted toward the
4C1 chair (cf. GlcNAc). Puckers involved in the transition
between GlcNAc 4C1 and 1C4 chair conformers were largely
precluded in GlcNS (except
implying that
N-sulfonation signiﬁcantly slows the rate of 4C1 ↔ 1C4 con-
formational exchange by blocking these intermediates. The
N-sulfo substituent
is ubiquitous in HS, where GlcNAc is
sequentially modiﬁed by N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase
enzymes prior to sequential O-sulfotransferase-catalyzed sul-
fonation at
the 6-O- and 3-O-positions (Rabenstein 2002).
Our results intimate that this modiﬁcation both rigidiﬁes and
stabilizes the 4C1 pucker of HS GlcNAc residues.

Rearrangement of sulfo groups from the axial to the more
solvent-favorable equatorial orientation is probably a major
driver of the 1C4 → 4C1 transition in the di- and tri-sulfonated

1658

the distance between
hexosamines orientations. However,
sulfo groups also increased as a result of this transition,
suggesting that it was partially driven by electrostatic repul-
sion (Figure 8). Together, these observations infer that pucker-
ing of the GlcNAc pyranose scaffold is strongly dependent on
sulfo substituents and polymerization, but further studies are
required to conﬁrm this. Such insights will facilitate molecular
design by making it possible to predict substitutions that
perturb the aqueous conformational equilibrium,
rates of
puckering and concomitant bioactivity. For example, based on
our simulations, we now hypothesize that GlcNAc glycosides
more bulky than a methyl group would further decrease the
rate of 4C1 ↔ 1C4 conformational exchange in water.

Equilibration of pucker was realized on the same timescale
as seen previously for uronic acids (Sattelle et al. 2010), but
the predicted 1-OMe-GlcNAc forward (4C1 → 1C4) exchange
rate (0.3 μs−1) was much slower
than in 1-OMe-IdoA
(19 μs−1), again indicating that epimerization at the C5 pos-
ition signiﬁcantly lowers the barrier to kinetic exchange of
pucker. In both GlcNAc and IdoA, the 1C4 conformer was
computed to be accessible at room temperature; the key differ-
ence was the kinetics of exchange, which was slower in
GlcNAc due to the relatively-higher free energy of the 1C4
pucker ((cid:1)3 kcal mol−1 higher than in IdoA). The effect of
IdoA2S on 1-OMe-IdoA was to shift the equilibrium confor-
mation
(1-OMe-IdoA and
1-OMe-IdoA2S were predicted to be 76 and 91% 1C4,
respectively), whereas in C5-epimerised and N-acetylated
GlcNAc, N-, 6-O- and 3-O-sulfonation favored the 4C1 chair.
Furthermore, the studies performed here suggest that our pre-
vious work on methylglycosides of uronic acids may be more
representative of puckering exchange rates in polysaccharides
than monosaccharides. Together, these data provide a basis
for understanding glycosaminoglycan 3D structure.

Characterization of glycosaminoglycan 3D structures will
enable the design of biotechnological devices and medicines
(Gama et al. 2006; Ghosh et al. 2009). The predicted substitu-
ent dependence of GlcNAc puckering, and that of uronic
acids (Sattelle et al. 2010), leads us to hypothesize that the
slower exchange kinetics of sulfonated GlcNAc residues
(favoring a more rigid 4C1 chair) may, in concert with electro-
static repulsion of sulfo moieties, contribute to the observation
that HS S-domains are more rigid than NA-domains (Mobli
et al. 2008). The simulations also suggest
that puckering
could have a signiﬁcant effect on HS-domain structure by
altering chain direction, and it is conceivable that it has a
more dominating effect on bioactivity than the glycosidic
linkage motions, which are unperturbed by sulfonation
(Mulloy and Forster 2000). Insight into the relative contri-
bution of microscopic uronic acid and hexosamine puckering
to macroscopic HS-domain 3D structure will be gained from
future conformationally equilibrated (microsecond-timescale)

Despite being rare events, the proposed 4C1 ↔ 1C4 transitions

to be accessible for this hexosamine in water at room tempera-

Knowledge of puckering in GlcNAc will lead to new molecu-

constituent of protein post-translational modiﬁcations (Marino
et al. 2010; Nothaft and Szymanski 2010). Rational modiﬁcation
of epitope GlcNAc puckering kinetics can be expected to modu-
late protein recognition and thereby facilitate development of
therapeutics (Jefferis 2009). Also, there are no available 3D struc-
tures of Rhizobium nodulation factors, which are characterized by
a backbone of between three and ﬁve substituted (sulfonated)
GlcNAc residues. Recent work has begun to address this knowl-
edge gap with NMR and nanosecond-simulations (Morando et al.
2011). Deﬁnition of nodulation factor SARs and generation of
synthetic derivatives will
accelerate production of non-
leguminous plants that can ﬁx nitrogen themselves, toward which
our extended microsecond-simulations now contribute. Our pre-
dictions also provide a new avenue for development of novel pep-
tidoglycans (for amelioration of bacterial pathogenicity) and
biomaterials from marine carbohydrates and chitin (Khoushab
and Yamabhai 2010). Furthermore, understanding equilibrium
conformer populations and the kinetics of exchange in atomic
detail, as has been described, will rationalize decision-making in
structure-based design and facilitate generation of increasingly
high-afﬁnity, typically weak-binding, carbohydrate-based ligands.

Conclusions

The longest carbohydrate simulations to date were performed
on the ubiquitous monosaccharide GlcNAc and biologically
important derivatives to investigate microsecond dynamics
that cannot currently be quantiﬁed by experiments or other
computational approaches. In water, at equilibrium, GlcNAc
underwent microsecond-timescale exchange between chair

Our 3D-structural and kinetic insights have extensive rami-
ﬁcations for understanding and exploiting 3D SARs in glyco-
biology. The importance of puckering in a myriad of
GlcNAc-containing sugars (e.g. glycosaminoglycans, nodula-
tion factors and glycosylation fragments) can now be tested
experimentally. This
interdisciplinary approach,
identiﬁcation of pivotal kinetic 3D intermediates
and
concomitant-directed chemical modiﬁcation of equilibrium
conformer populations and exchange kinetics, has great poten-
tial to revolutionize glycan design.

Materials and methods
MD simulations
The monosaccharides were prepared using the AMBER tool
Leap (Case et al. 2005) and in-house software (to deﬁne 4C1
and 1C4 puckers). Each of the 10 initial conﬁgurations was
explicitly solvated in a cubic water box ((cid:1)25 × 25 × 25 Å)
and neutralized with the appropriate number of Na+ counter-
ions, followed by 1000 steps of energy minimization. MDs
were performed with ACEMD (Harvey et al. 2009) on
force-ﬁelds
NVIDIA graphics
GLYCAM06g (Kirschner et al. 2008) and TIP3P (Jorgensen
et al. 1983). Hydrogen atoms were constrained using the
M-SHAKE
The
velocity-Verlet
integration algorithm and a hydrogen mass
repartitioning scheme were used to achieve a 4 fs time-step
without affecting the equilibrium distribution (Buch et al.
2010). Electrostatic and van der Waals interactions were trun-
cated at 9 Å and the recommended scaling factor for carbo-
hydrate 1–4 interactions (1.0) was used. Parameters not
present
in GLYCAM06 (the angle O-S-O and the torsion
C2-O2-S-O) were
appended from the General Amber
Force-ﬁeld (Wang et al. 2004). Merz–Singh–Kollman (Singh
and Kollman 1984) electrostatic potential-derived partial
charges for the sulfonated monosaccharides were computed
using Gaussian 03 (Frisch et al. 2004) following gas-phase

algorithm (Krautler

2001).

geometry optimization at the HF/6-31G(d)//HF/6-31G(d) level
of theory (consistent with GLYCAM06). Following 20 ns of
heating and 250 ns of thermal equilibration at 298 K (which
were discarded), MD simulations of each monosaccharide
were performed for 10 µs in the NVT ensemble. Data were
saved to ﬁle every 10 ps.

NMR spectroscopy
Natural abundance samples were prepared from lyophilized
material (Dextra, Reading, UK) reconstituted in 594 µL of
D2O, 99.990% (w/v) and 6 µL of DSS (4,4-dimethyl-
4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid). Samples were adjusted to pD =
7.0 and ﬁnal concentrations were in the range 41–56 mM. All
spectra were recorded at 25°C. Chemical shifts of 1H and 13C
atoms were assigned from the following standard heteronuclear
NMR spectra recorded with a 1H frequency of 600 MHz on a
Bruker spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient TXI cryop-
robe: [1H–13C] HSQC, [1H–1H] COSY, [1H–1H] TOCSY and a
[1H–13C] HSQC–TOCSY. [1H] 1D spectra were also recorded
with a 1H frequency of 900 MHz (Varian INOVA 900), 32,768
points, an acquisition time of 2949.17 ms and a dwell time of
45.5 µs. Vicinal couplings were measured from 900 MHz [1H]
1D spectra unless otherwise stated. Spectra were processed
with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al. 1995) and analyzed with
Sparky (Goddard and Kneller 2006) and Analysis (Vranken
et al. 2005). Proton chemical shifts were referenced relative to
internal DSS and heteronuclei were referenced indirectly. As
detailed previously (Blundell et al. 2004; Blundell, Deangelis,
et al. 2006; Blundell, Reed, et al. 2006), appropriate linear pre-
diction, window functions and zero-ﬁlling were used to
achieve the maximum possible resolution from each data set.

QM calculations
Conformers representative of the complete pyranose Cremer–
Pople (Cremer and Pople 1975) conformational space (74 in
total) were built using in-house software, which systematically
increments θ- and w-parameters (by 30°) and then performs
constrained gas-phase energy minimization (to maintain the
pucker) using the UFF force ﬁeld (Rappe et al. 1992).
Single-point energy density functional
theory calculations
were performed on each geometry optimized conformer using
Gaussian 03 (Frisch et al. 2004) at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
level of theory in the gas phase and using the self-consistent
reaction ﬁeld polarizable continuum model (Cances et al.
1997; Cossi et al. 2002), whereby the electrostatic shielding
effect of bulk solvent is treated as a continuous medium. The
dielectric constant was set to 78.38, representative of water at
298.15 K. Charge and multiplicity values of 0/1, −1/1, −2/1
and −3/1 were used for GlcNAc and the mono-, di- and tri-
sulfonated hexosamines, respectively.

Computed vicinal couplings and rotamer populations
Vicinal couplings were calculated using torsional data from
the full 20 µs simulations for GlcNAc and 1-OMe-GlcNAc
and from the 10 µs 4C1-initiated trajectories for all other mol-
ecules. The sulfate-adjusted Karplus equation of Hricovini
and Bizik (Altona and Haasnoot 1980; Hricovini and Bizik
2007) was used for ring vicinal couplings. The relationships

1660

and

used

(1980) and Mobli and Almond
of Altona and Haasnoot
(2007) were
acetamido
hydroxymethyl
for
(HN-N2-C2-H2) vicinal couplings, respectively. Values and
standard deviations were obtained by computing the vicinal
coupling for each 1 μs sub-trajectory and averaging. Hydroxyl
orientations were binned as gauche(−), anti(t) or gauche(+)
centered on −60, 180 and 60°, respectively. Hydroxymethyl
conformations (tg, gt and gg) were deﬁned by the torsions
O6-C6-C5-O5 and O6-C6-C5-C4. To estimate hydroxymethyl
rotamer populations directly from NMR data, the scalar coup-
lings H5 to H6proR/S were ﬁtted to a rigid three-site model
(Poppe 1993) comprising variable populations of tg, gt and
gg conformers using the
and
Haasnoot.

relationships of Altona

Cremer–Pople analysis
Puckers were classiﬁed (using the pyranose ring atoms O5,
C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5) by analysis of the Cremer–Pople
(Cremer and Pople 1975) parameters Q, θ and w, which are
the radius, azimuthal and meridian angles (respectively) of the
spherical puckering coordinate system describing all possible
puckers for a six-membered ring. The Q-value represents the
puckering magnitude (deviation from a ﬂat ring), θ describes
the type of pucker (chair, half-chair, boat, etc.) and w is a
phase angle describing pseudorotation.
In the text and
Supplementary data, a value of θ = 0° corresponds to 4C1 and
θ = 180° to 1C4. Plots of each parameter, for each simulation,
are reported in the Supplementary data S1. Equilibration of
the simulations was assessed by comparing the convergence
of the Cremer–Pople polar angle ácosθñ (which represents the
average ring pucker, see Supplementary data S1), for simu-
lations started in 4C1 and 1C4 puckers, as described previously
(Sattelle et al. 2010). For analysis of GlcNAc 3D structures
from the PDB, 794 and 13 GlcNAc and GlcNS6S crystallo-
graphic depositions were identiﬁed with resolution ≤2.0 Å,
containing,
3D structures.
Acceptable limits of Q were deﬁned as 0.8 (maximum) and
0.4 (minimum).

Free energy and rate constant and calculations
Free energies were derived from the relationship ΔG = |RT ln
(p1/p2)|, where p1 and p2 are the equilibrium populations of
4C1 and 1C4 conformers, respectively, R the gas constant and
T the temperature. Conformational exchange rates (k1 and k2)
were derived by calculating the average time for transitions
(4C1 → 1C4 and 1C4 → 4C1) and taking the reciprocal. The
reported equilibrium constants are the ratio of the rates, Keq =
k1/k2. The relationship G = |RT ln Keq| was used to conﬁrm
computed free energies. These equations can be found in stan-
dard chemistry textbooks.
