Abstract:  Mycobacteria  are  aerobic,  nonspore  forming,  non-motile,single-cell  bacteria.Of  more  than  40  currently  
recognized  species  of  mycobacteria,  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis,  the  causative  agent  of  human  TB  is  the  commonest 
pathogen for pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis  cases. The other  members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
complex  (MTC)  or  the  nontubercular  mycobacterium  (NTM)  produces  similar  diseases  which  cannot  be  differentiated 
from  tuberculosis  by  clinical  symptoms  and  signs.  But  this  differentiation  is  important  as  the  chemotherapy  varies  
widely  according  to  the  strain  of  mycobacterium.  The  burden  of  morbidity  and  mortality  of  tuberculosis  is  rapidly  
growing  worldwide,  particularly  with  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemic.  The  strain  identification  of  Mycobacterium  remains  a 
cumbersome, labor intensive and expensive procedure, which requires 3 to 12 weeks of time. The conventional methods of 
strain  identification  lack  proper  standardization  and  precise  diagnosis.  The  prime  objective  of  this  study  is  to  overcome 
these problems. 

A  multiplex  PCR  using  3  amplicons  of  165,365,  and  541  base  pair  target  sequences  was  done  with  a  total  number  of  
165  clinical  isolates  of  suspected  Koch’s  patients.  Strain  identification  was  compared  both  by  conventional  methods  
and multiplex PCR. The  results of  the  study show  that this multiplex PCR is  supposed to be less  complicated, less  time 
consuming,  cost-effective  and  superior  to  the  conventional  methods.  It  is  also  applicable  for  culture  negative  samples 
where strain identification is not possible by conventional approach. 

Key Words: M. tuberculosis, Non Tubercular Mycobacteriosis, Culture, Multiplex PCR, Strain differention. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

  Based  on  surveillance  and  survey  data,  WHO  estimates 
that 9.27 million new cases of TB occurred in 2007.Of these 
9.27  million  new  cases,  an  estimated  44%  were  new  smear 
positive  cases,  14.8%  were  HIV  positive  cases  and  4.9% 
were  MDR-TB  (which  includes  3.1%  new  cases  and  19% 
previously  treated  cases).  An  estimated  1.32  million  HIV-
negative  people  died  from  TB  in  2007  and  there  were  an 
additional  4,56,000  TB  deaths  among  HIV  positive  people 
[ICD-10].  India  is  ranking  top  among  27  high  MDR-TB  
burden  countries.  Incidence  of  MDR-TB  in  INDIA  is  
reported  to  vary  from  0.1%-5.4%.MDR-TB  among  all  new 
TB  cases  are  2.8%,  whereas  17%  among  the  previously 
treated cases [1-5]. Moreover, the HIV/AIDS has produced a 
devastating  effect  on  TB  control  worldwide  [6].  Among  the 
mycobacterial diseases (both pulmonary and extrapulmonary) 
M.tuberculosis  complex  has  got  the  lion’s  share.  But  the 
infection  with  Nontubercular  Mycobacterium  (NTM)  or

Mycobacterium  Other  Than  Tuberculosis  (MOTT)  is  also 
increasing rapidly.  

  This  MOTT  complex  can  cause  pulmonary  infection  as 
well  as  extrapulmonary  lesions  (Lymph  node,  skin  &  soft 
tissue,  joint  or  systemic  disseminated  infection)  in  immuno-
compromised  hosts.  The  majority  of  such  infections  are  
due to M. avium &  M. intracellure (MAI).Other responsible 
pathogens  are  M.scrofulaceum,  M.kansasii,  M.fortuitum, 
M.ulcerans  etc.  [7].  In  1959,Runyon  classified  NTM  into 
four  groups  (I  to  IV)  based  on  phenotypic  characterization, 
particularly growth rate  and pigmentation [8]. The treatment 
of  diseases  with  M.tuberculosis  complex  and  MOTT  com-
plex  are  different  because  many  of  the  first  and  second  line 
of antitubercular drugs are ineffective against many members 
of  the  MOTT  organisms.  The  most  effective  drugs  against 
these organisms are macrolide or aminoglycoside antibiotics. 
The  treatment  protocol  heavily  depends  on  the  species  of 
mycobacterium  isolated,  site  and  severity  of  infection  [9]. 
The  report  of  drug  sensitivity  testing  is  not  always  reliable 
and the duration of the treatment is protracted. On other side 
Pyrazinamide  is  ineffective  in  M.bovis  infection  [10].  So, 
strain  identification  from  the  clinical  specimens  is  critical

particularly  in  case  of  patients  not  responding  to  conven-
tional  therapy,  relapse  or  in  immunocompromised  subjects. 
Moreover,  an  early  diagnosis  of  species  helps  us  to  curtail 
huge  burden  of  treatment  with  ineffective  drugs  and  reduce 
patients’ morbidity and mortality [11]. 

  The  conventional  method  of  identification  of  species  in-
volves  culture  on  LJ  slants  and  liquid  medium  followed  by 
observing the rate of growth and pigment production (where 
applicable).  Moreover, the growth of cultures was studied in 
different  temperature  gradient  to  identify  the  mycobacterial 
species.  Biochemical  tests  like  niacin  production,  nitrate 
reduction,  semi  quantitative  and  heat  resistant  catalase  pro-
duction etc are also required [12]. 

  These  are  time  consuming,  complicated  and  laborious 
procedures  whereas  a  multiplex  PCR  involving  three  ampli-
cons  (165bp,365bp  and  541bp  fragments)  can  identify  and 
differentiate  between  different  species  of  mycobacterium 
[13, 14] and this method is also highly sensitive and specific 
[15]. 

2. MATERIALS & METHODS 

2.1. Specimen Collection 

  This cross sectional study was done with the Institutional 
Bioethical  permission.  Patients  of  all  ages  and  both  sexes 
recently  diagnosed  to  be  suffering  from  pulmonary  or  ex-
trapulmonary  tuberculosis  were  randomly  chosen  from  in 
and  out  patients’  departments  of  three  tertiary  care  hospital 
in Kolkata, Eastern part of India. The diagnosis of tuberculo-
sis  is  based  on  the  clinical  examination,  microscopy  for 
AFB,  manteaux  test,  Chest  Skiagram,  ESR,  Cytological  ex-
amination  and  ADA  estimation  of  aspirated  fluid  .  Sputum 
samples  were  collected  from  pulmonary  tuberculosis  pa-
tients. Body fluids (like  CSF, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid); 
blood, tissue or  lymph node aspirates from patients  with ex-
trapulmonary  tuberculosis  were  collected  aseptically  using 
all precautions. Total numbers of samples were 165.The total 
span of the study was conducted from July 2006 to February 
2008. 

2.2. Specimen Processing 

Sputum  samples  were  liquefied  and  decontaminated  
 
using  an  equal  volume  of  4%  NaOH,  2.9%  Sodium  citrate 
 

Gupta et al. 

solution and N-Acetyl–L-Cysteine for 30 minutes incubation 
at room temperature. After decontamination, specimens were 
neutralized  with  sterile  PBS  (pH6.8).  After  centrifugation  at 
3000Xg  for  30  minutes,  supernatant  was  discarded  and 
sediment  was  suspended  in  sterile  water.The  body  fluids 
were  concentrated  in  usual  methods.  Tissue  or  lymph  node 
aspirates  decontaminated  and  concentrated  for  AFB  smear, 
culture  inoculation.  PBMC  layer  were  collected  from  the 
blood samples of the patients by histopaque density gradient 
method. All the samples were ready for isolating DNA.  

2.3. Demonstration of Acid Fast Bacilli Smears 

 
Smears were prepared using the dissolved sediment from 
all  specimens,  stained  by  Ziehl-Neelson  (ZN)  method,  and 
examined  for  presence  of  AFB  with  a  light  microscope. 
Smears  recorded  as  positive  if  at  least  1  to  9  AFB  per  100 
high power fields were observed [16, 17]. 

2.4.  Isolation  of  DNA  and  Multiplex  PCR  for  Species 
Identification 

  After  decontamination  and  concentration,  sample  was 
moistened  with  adjustable  amount  of  TE  buffer  (pH  7.6). 
After  scrapping  the  cytological  material,  it  was  dissolved 
thoroughly  in  TE  buffer.  Mycobacterial  DNA  was  extracted 
from  clinical  specimens  using  a  modification  of  the  lysis 
method  described  by  Sritharan  and  Barker  (1991).  The  
sediments  were  resuspended  in  100  μl  of  TE-Triton  X-100 
buffer (10 Mm Tris, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 
8)  with  200  (cid:2)g/ml  proteinase  K,  incubated  at  56oC  for  3 
hours,  and  then  incubated  at  95oC  for  30  min.  After  each 
incubation, the specimens were placed on ice for 5 min. The 
protease-treated  and  heated  specimens  were  next  extracted 
with  Phenol:  Chloroform:  Isoamyl  Alcohol  (25:24:1).  The 
aqueous  phases  of  the  organic  extractions  were  precipitated 
with  ethanol  overnight.  The  DNA  was  dissolved  in  200  μl  
of  TE  buffer  [18].  Reference  strains  of  M.  tuberculosis 
(H37RV),  M.  bovis,  M.  smegmatis,  M.  intracellulare  and  
M. avium were obtained from  Tuberculosis  Research  Centre 
(TRC),  Chennai,  India.  Extraction  of  genomic  DNA  was 
done  from  reference  strains  cultured  on  LJ  media  by  
standard  method.  Multiplex  PCR  as  earlier  developed  in  
our  laboratory  was  done  to  amplify  the  following  target  
sequences [19, 20].

tion  (5min  at  85°C),  followed  by  40  cycles  each  of  1  min  
at  94°C,  1  min  at  55°C,  and  2  min  at  72°C,  with  a  final  
 

extension of 10 min at 72°C and a post incubation of 30 min 
at 4°C. Each DNA amplification experiment included a posi-
tive  control  (Reference  strains  like:  M.  tuberculosis  H37Rv 
DNA) and a negative control (distilled water). The amplified

2.5.  Culture  by  Inoculation  in  LJ  Medium  and  Liquid 
Medium 

  All the samples (N=165) were included in the study The 
samples  were  inoculated  on  LJ  media  and  liquid  medium 
Middlebrook 7H9 with OADC supplement in our laboratory. 

2.6. Biochemical Tests 

  Then  biochemical  tests  like  Niacin  Production,  Nitrate 
Production,  Catalase  production  (semi  quantitative  &  heat 
resistant),  TWEEN-80  Hydrolysis,  Growth  in  presence  of 
Paranitrobenzoic  acid  (PNB)  were  done  to  differentiate 
among different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis com-
plex  and  NTM.  To  differentiate  between  Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis, Growth on PZA con-
taining media, Sensitivity to TCH, Niacin production, Nitrate 
Reduction were performed [12, 21]. 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 
In  this  study  we  found  that  out  of  165  samples,  126 
(76.36%) were PCR positive whereas 95 (57.57%) were cul-
ture  positive.  The  overall  AFB  positive  samples  was  85 
(15.5%)  (Table  1).  Out  of  total  samples  136(82.42%)  were 
sputum.  Rest  were  pleural  fluid(n=14),peritoneal  fluid 
(n=02),CSF(n=06),Blood(n=04),Lymph  node  Aspirate(n=02) 
and  tissues(n=01)  (Table  2).  Out  of  126  PCR  positive  sam-
ples 102 (80.95%) showed all the three target amplifications 
and  thus  diagnosed  as  M.tuberculosis.  Only  2(1.6%)  cases 
were attributed to M.bovis which shows amplification only at 
165bp  region  .18  (14.28%)  cases  were  nontuberculous  my-
cobacteria and the rest 4 (3.10%) were inconclusive showing 
nonspecific amplifications.

  The  atypical  mycobacteria  (NTM)  were  identified  either 
by amplification of both 165 and 365 bp target sequences or 
only  165bp  M.  intracellulare  amplicons  were  20–40  bp 
shorter than that of M.tuberculosis or M. bovis (target region 
165 bp) due to small deletion. It  can be used to differentiate 
this organism from the M .tuberculosis complex [19, 20]. 

  Out  of  95  culture  positive  samples  72(75.78%)  were  
Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis  whereas  3  (3.16%)  were 
M.bovis  and  6  (6.32%)  were  MOTT  or  NTM.  14  (14.74%) 
strains  remained  inconclusive  (Table  3).  This  study  was  
in  accordance  with  the  study  made  by  Schultz  et  al.  [22], 
who demonstrated the isolations were 71% of M.tuberculosis 
and 34% of atypical mycobacterial strains from 191 archival 
specimens of  tissues. In the study of Ergin et al.  the respec-
tive  isolations  were  79.1%and  20.8%  in  120  specimens  
[23].

Species  identification  by  conventional  cultural  methods 
and  biochemical  tests  are  of  limited  value  because  of  the 
comparatively  low  yield  of  the  culture  and  long  time  to 
grow.  Even  the  so-called  rapid  growers  may  require  1-3 
weeks  to  grow.  The  differentiation  of  M.tuberculosis  and 
M.bovis  is  not  always  conclusive.  Niacin  production  and 
PZA  sensitivity  tests  lengthen  the  reporting  time  span.  Pig-
ment  production  in  light  (photochromogens)  and  in  both 
light  and  dark  (scrotochromogens)  are  subjective  observa-
tions  that  cannot  be  standardized  To  achieve  good  pigment 
production colonies should be young, actively metabolizing, 
isolated  and  well  aerated.  [24]  Some  members  require  pro-
longed  exposure  to  light.  Some  others  (like  M.  szulgi)  need 
incubation  at  35  ºC.  In  our  study,  we  also  observed  the 
growth both at 30 ºC and at 37ºC.Moreover  many important 
members  of  MOTT  complex  e.g.  M.avium-intracellulare 
(MAI)  and  M.ulcerans  etc.  are  nonchromogenic  i.e.  do  not 
produce  any  pigment  at  all.  Complicated  biochemical  tests 
like Niacin production, Nitrate reduction,  Tween80 hydroly-
sis,  Catalase  etc.  are  required  to  differentiate  them  from 
M.tuberculosis complex as already mentioned. [12,25]. 

 
In the current study, even with this time consuming labo-
rious  effort  the  species  identification  by  conventional  meth-
ods is low. It was possible in 81 culture positive cases which 
are only 49.99% of total 165 cases. Schultz S et al. [22] also, 
in  their  study,  found  that  only  41  out  of  190  specimens 
(21.5%) were culture positive in which species identification 
could  be  made.  On  the  other  hand,  species  identification  is 
much  rapid  and  more  accurate  alternative  where  122  cases 
out  of  165(73.93%)  could  be  categorized  into  different  

Gupta et al. 

species.  The  overall  isolation  of  M.tuberculosis  Complex 
(M.tuberculosis  and  M.  bovis)  is  63%  [M.tuberculosis 
61.8%and  M.bovis1.2%]  in  comparison  to  MOTT  which  is 
10.9%. 2.4% cases gave  ambiguous results by showing non-
specific bands on PCR followed by gel electrophoresis. This 
may be due to contamination. Ergin et al. [23] in their study, 
evaluated in share of M.tuberculosis as 79.1% and MOTT as 
20.8%  in  120  mycobacterial  strains  isolated  from  clinical 
specimens  by  PCR-RFLP.  The  result  of  our  study  is  in  ac-
cordance with the study made by Ergin et al. It is to be noted 
here that the failure in species identification by conventional 
methods is much higher (14 cases) which accounts for 8.48% 
of  overall  165  cases.Over  last  decade,  the  rate  of  non-AIDS 
associated infection is also increasing and many of the newly 
identified NTM species have been identified using molecular 
biological  tool (including DNA  sequencing) rather than out-
dated  phenotypic  characterization.  Thus  PCR  base  studies 
along  with  some  conventional  tests  are  becoming  indispen-
sable for proper identification of NTM organisms [12]. 

  The sensitivity and specificity of PCR depends on selec-
tion  of  the  target  sequence.  Eisenarch et  al.  used  primer  de-
signed  from  IS6110  sequence  to  diagnose  pulmonary  tuber-
culosis  [25].  Norle  et  al.  demonstrated  that  IS  6110  based 
PCR  assay  is  91%  sensitive  &  100%  specific  in  detecting 
Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  in  sputum  [26].  But  Kent  et  al. 
detected  24  false  positive  cases  out  of  31  non  tuberculosis 
cases.  It  was  thought  that  mycobacterial  species  other  than 
Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  might  be  responsible  for  this 
[27].  In  this  study  we  have  included  hsp  65  genes  &  dnaj 
gene  along  with IS6110  and  performed  a  multiplex  PCR,  so 
that  it  does  not  only  diagnose  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis 
with greater accuracy but also help to identify the species of 
mycobacterium, as already mentioned. But one point should 
be kept in mind. Due to widespread and ubiquitous presence 
of MOTT organisms in nature, they can colonize in different 
human organs without causing infection.  Hence, mere  isola-
tion  of  NTM  organisms  from  clinical  specimens  is  not  tan-
tamount  to  infection  by  itself.  Therefore  the  American  Tho-
racic  Society  recommends  diagnostic  criteria  for  NTM  dis-
eases to help physicians interpret laboratory results [12, 28]. 

4. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY 

  DNA sequencing, DNA micro array and line probe assay 
to  identify  the  causative  organisms  are  definitely  more  con-
clusive.  If  these  procedures  could  be  included,  the  study 
would  get  enriched.  But  belonging  to  third  world  country 
and  having  a  huge  burden  of  tuberculosis  patients,  these  so-
phisticated tests could not be done as a routine practice. 

5. CONCLUSION 

  To  differentiate  between  M.tuberculosis  complex  and 
nontuberculous mycobacteria, multiplex PCR is  a very good 
tool. If it is used in conjunction with culture and biochemical 
tests; it is  likely  to give best results.  Moreover, our in house 
developed  multiplex  PCR  will  be  much  more  cost  effective 
than other molecular biological assay.
