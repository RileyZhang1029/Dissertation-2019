Abstract: An extensive portion of the healthcare budget is allocated to chronic human infection. Chronic wounds in par-
ticular are a major contributor to this financial burden. Little is known about the types of bacteria which may contribute to 
the chronicity, biofilm and overall bioburden of the wound itself. In this study we compare the bacteriology of wounds 
and associated intact skin. Wound and paired intact skin swabs (from a contralateral location) were collected. The bacte-
rial diversity was determined using bacterial Tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP). Diversity analysis 
showed intact skin to be significantly more diverse than wounds on both the species and genus levels (3% and 5% diver-
gence). Furthermore, wounds show heightened levels of anaerobic bacteria, like Peptoniphilus, Finegoldia, and Anaero-
coccus,  and other detrimental genera such as Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus. Although some of these and other 
bacterial genera were found to be common between intact skin and wounds, notable opportunistic wound pathogens were 
found at lower levels in intact skin. Principal Component Analysis demonstrated a clear separability of the two groups. 
The findings of  the  study not only greatly support the hypothesis of differing bacterial  composition of  intact  skin and 
wounds, but also contribute additional insight into the ecology of skin and wound microflora. The increased diversity and 
lowered levels of opportunistic pathogens found in skin make the system highly distinguishable from wounds.

INTRODUCTION  
  A  major  and  ever  increasing  portion  of  the  healthcare 
budget  is  dedicated  to  treatment  of  chronic  infections  [1]. 
These  infections  include  chronic  wounds,  and  comprise  
60-80%  of  all  human  infectious  diseases  [2].  Chronic 
wounds, by definition are wounds  that have  a biological or 
physiological  reason  for  not  healing.  One  of  the  primarily 
barriers to healing has now been identified as biofilm pheno-
type  polymicrobial  infections  [1-3].  Biofilm  is  the  natural 
physiological  state  of  bacteria  and  are  typically  defined  as 
polymicrobial  populations  of  cells  encased  in  hydrated  ex-
tracellular  polymeric  substances  and  attached  to  a  surface 
(e.g.  tissue).  Bacteria  found  in  chronic  wounds,  therefore, 
usually  exist  as  biofilm  communities  [4-7].  Due  to  the 
physiological properties of biofilm phenotype, bacteria com-
prising  the  communities  become  highly  resistant  to  many 
traditional  therapies,  thus one of the  most  successful strate-
gies  for  the  management  of  the  wound  is  biofilm-based 
wound care [3-8].  
  Diabetic ulcers, a subgroup of chronic wounds, occur in 
about 15% of diabetic patients and often lead to hospitaliza-
tion  and  amputation  [9].  More  than  80,000  amputations

occur in the US within the diabetic population per year and 
account  for  a  threefold  increase  in  risk  of  death  within  18 
months [10]. Major limb amputation is also associated with 
depression and increased  mortality  and morbidity rates [11, 
12]. Thus, preventing amputation must be the primary ethical 
goal of wound care practitioners.  
  Little  is  known  about  the  types  of  bacteria  that  might 
contribute  to  the  bioburden  in  chronic  wounds.  Several  re-
cent  studies  are  now  shedding  new  light  on  the  bacterial 
populations  associated  with  chronic  wounds  [4,  13,  14], 
however there is not much information comparing the bacte-
rial  diversity  of  intact  skin  to  that  found  in  chronic  wound 
biofilms.  The  medical  and  research  communities  have  real-
ized  the  diversity  and  composition  of  the  chronic  wounds 
may  be  an  important  influence  to  the  chronicity  of  the 
wounds,  thus  it  is  important  to  assess  the  composition  of 
diabetic  ulcers  and  identify  the  differentiating  qualities  be-
tween intact skin and the wounds. 
  Only about 2% of all known bacteria are able to be cul-
tured  in  the  laboratory  [15].  Molecular  methods  allow  for 
chronic wounds and skin samples to be evaluated without the 
need for culture. Molecular methods are now available which 
will  allow  the  patient  to  be  diagnosed,  treated  and  re-
evaluated  in  an  appropriate  timeframe  while  identifying  a 
wider  range  of  bacteria  contributing  to  the  biofilm  popula-
tion  [14,  16].  This  is  an  important  concept  because  newer 
molecular methods can identify even previously uncharacter-

ized  bacteria  which  are  difficult  or  impossible  to  culture  in 
the laboratory [13].  
  Using pyrosequencing 16s ribosomal DNA methods, we 
assessed the bacterial microflora of diabetic ulcers and intact 
skin. During this study we sought to characterize the micro-
biota consistently of  chronic wounds (likely  contributing  to 
their chronicity) and contrast this with the microbiota of in-
tact skin on the same subjects providing a comparative look 
at  wound  and  skin  microflora  within  the  same  individual. 
This  could  possibly  provide  insight  into  the  importance  of 
the diabetic condition and the possibility of the disease itself 
making  a  person  vulnerable  to  specific  types  of  chronic 
wound infections promoted by the subjects own skin.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Intact Skin and Wound Samples 
  Debridement  and  skin  swab  samples  were  collected  for 
53  total  samples  (23  samples  were  collected  from  wounds 
and 28 from intact  skin)  at  the Southwest  Regional Wound 
Care Center in accordance with Western Institutional Review 
Board  protocol  number  20062347.  All  patients  provided 
written consent. Diabetic subjects with chronic wounds were 
chosen for this study. All samples were collected using ster-
ile technique and immediately frozen in collection tubes at -
80oC until DNA extraction was performed as described pre-
viously  [13].  Paired  samples  were  collected  from  collateral 
locations  on  each  subject  of  each  other  (ex.  wound  sample 
collected  from  left  ankle,  intact  skin  sample  collected  from 
same location on right ankle). 

Wound Sample DNA Extraction and bTEFAP 
  DNA  extractions  and  the  bacterial  tag-encoded  FLX  
amplicon  pyrosequencing  (bTEFAP)  were  performed  by 
Research  and  Testing  Laboratories  (Lubbock,  TX;  www. 
researchandtesting.com). Data from the study was deposited 
in the short read archive of NCBI. 

bTEFAP Sequence Processing Pipeline 
 
Scripts written in C# within a Microsoft® .NET (Micro-
soft Corp, Seattle, WA) development environment were used 
for  all  post  sequencing  processing.  Discussion  of  software 
code is outside the scope of this report; however, a brief de-
scription  of  the  algorithm  follows.  Quality  trimmed  se-
quences obtained from the FLX sequencing run were derived 
directly  from  FLX  sequencing  run  output  files.  Tags  were 
extracted from the multi-FASTA file into individual sample-
specific  files  based  upon  the  tag  sequence.  Tags  which  did 
not have 100% homology to the sample designation were not 
considered.  Sequences  which  were  less  than  200  bp  after 
quality trimming were not considered. After parsing the tags 
into individual FASTA files the resultant individual samples 
were  labeled  and  concatenated  into  one  file  containing  all 
samples.  The  resulting  FASTA  formatted  file  was  then  
chimera  checked  using  a  custom  algorithm  appropriate  
for  high  throughput  analysis  for  the  16S  database  available  
at  http://www.researchandtesting.com/B2C2.  Chimeric 
sequences  were  removed  from  the  FASTA  file  to  form  a 
final FASTA sequence file. The final file was then evaluated 
using  BLASTn  [17]  against  a  database  derived  from  
(http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).  A  post  processing  
GenBank 

algorithm generated best-hit files. The parameters used have 
been previously evaluated to enable reliable identification at 
the  genus  level.  Following  best-hit  processing  a  secondary 
post-processing algorithm was used to determine the percent 
composition per sample. 

Statistics 
 
Statistical  analysis  was  performed  on  percent  composi-
tion files. Further custom scripts were built to find the most 
discriminating  and  the  least  discriminating  bacteria  in  each 
taxonomic  level  between  intact  and  wound  samples.  Each 
bacterium was considered as a feature and applied a feature 
selection (ranking) method. We used the area under the ROC 
curve  (AUC)  [18,  19]  feature  selection  method  [20].  The 
analysis focused on the genus and species classifications. For 
each  feature  (taxonomic  classification  in  this  case),  AUC 
was computed. This area under the curve represents the dis-
crimination capability of the feature. The scores are scaled to 
[0.5, 1] to consider only the magnitude, not the direction of 
discrimination.  Scores  closest  to  1  are  more  discriminating 
while  those  close  to  0.5  represent  bacteria  found  equally 
abundantly in both intact and wound samples.  
  The  similarity  between  the  compositions  within  various 
groups  was  performed  using  the  Pearson  correlation  dis-
tances [21, 22]. This evaluation was performed for distances 
between  intact  and  wound  samples,  within  wound  samples, 
within intact samples, and between paired samples of intact 
and wounded skin on an individual. 
  To  assess  the  separability  of  the  intact  skin  and  wound 
samples,  Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  was  imple-
mented.  Custom  scripts  tailored  for  next  generation  data 
(Research  and  Testing  Laboratory,  Lubbock,  TX)  were  im-
plemented  to  formulate  the  environment  and  NEXUS  tree 
files for a distance matrix based on the UNIFRAC [23] for-
mula.  This  distance  matrix  was  used  for  Principal  Compo-
nent Analysis and Hierarchical clustering implemented using 
Python  scripts.  Samples  more  similar  to  each  other  should 
appear  closer  together  according  to  the  respective  axis  re-
flecting  the  variation  among  all  samples.  This  technique  is 
useful in displaying clusters existing within data. 

RESULTS  
Diversity Analysis 
  Our group has previously published several research arti-
cles  on  the  application  of  the  bTEFAP  pyrosequencing  ap-
proach for the analysis of chronic wound microbiota [7, 13, 
14]. In the first paper, a broad survey of wounds analyzed by 
molecular  methods  indicated  a  highly  diverse  composition 
found in chronic wound samples. While the analysis resulted 
in interesting findings, the follow up analysis used individual 
samples instead of a pooled composition from multiple dia-
betic foot ulcers. The work indicated the absence of any sin-
gle  or  discrete  individual  populations  of  bacteria  acting  as 
the culprit in chronic infections. No unique genus of bacteria 
was found in all samples, supporting the idea of functionally 
equivalent pathogroups establishing a highly resistant oppor-
tunistically  pathogenic  biofilm  [24],  contributing  to  the 
chronicity of the wound.  
  Continuing  the  molecular  approach  to  chronic  wound 
analysis,  our  group  has  now  performed  the  comparison  of 

10    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2010, Volume 4 

chronic  wounds  to  intact  skin.  It  is  the  next  logical  step  to 
not  only  identifying  the  major  players  in  wounds,  but  also 
identifying the reasons for the intact  collateral skin remain-
ing healthy. 
 
Pyrosequencing using the bTEFAP approach based upon 
titanium chemistry (average read length of 400bp) produced 
a total of 148,349 sequences between  the  intact  and wound 
samples.  After  quality  scoring  and  eliminating  sequences 
<200 nucleotides long, 101,950 sequences were used as the 
next  set  for  analyses.  Chimeric  sequences  represented  ~9% 
of the total samples and were removed leaving over 93,000 
high  quality  sequence  reads  among  samples.  Microbial  di-
versity  analysis  [25-28]  was  performed  by  clustering  se-
quence tags into groups of defined sequence variation rang-
ing  from  unique  sequences  to  10%  divergence  using  DO-
TUR  [29]  as  previously  described  [30].  Clusters  acting  as 
OTUs  were  used  as  input  for  calculations  with  the  abun-
dance-based  coverage  estimator  ACE  and  the  Chao1  [31] 
estimator  of  species  diversity  and  richness.  Tables  1  and  2 
show  the  microbial  diversity  estimates  obtained  with  para-
metric and non-parametric modeling of rarefaction, ACE and 

Table 1.  Diversity and Richness Data for Wound Samples

Chao1  for  intact  skin  and  for  samples  extracted  from 
wounds. When relatively large genetic distances (5% diver-
gence) are considered these estimates predict that even at the 
genus level  there  is significantly  less diversity and richness 
of  microbial  communities  in  wounds.  As  sequence  diver-
gence is more stringently analyzed, the significance levels of 
diversity  decrease  but  remains  significant.  At  the  species 
level (3% divergence), wounds remain less diverse than the 
intact  skin,  according  to  all  three  approaches,  Rarefaction, 
ACE, and Chao1. Table 3 summarizes the data from Tables 
1 and 2 with average values from the data and indicates sta-
tistical significance between the intact skin samples. Diver-
gence of 3%  and 5% is  indicative of sequences differing at 
the species and genus level, respectively. The student’s t-test 
results seen in Table 3 indicate significantly higher diversity 
levels in intact skin when compared to wounds.  
Composition Analysis 
  To better perform group comparisons, after the bTEFAP 
pipeline,  the  resulting  files  containing  the  percent  bacterial 
composition  per  sample  were  grouped  into  "intact"  and

"wound" groups. This data was  analyzed using Area Under 
the Curve (AUC) [18, 19] analysis to identify the important 
genera  within  each  group.  Bacterial  genera  occurring  in  at 
least 20 of the samples (combination of intact and wounded 
regions)  were  considered  to  ensure  a  representative  result 
and not attest to genera rarely found in the samples. Table 4 
displays the most and the least discriminating bacteria from 
the samples along with the average percentages at which the 

bacteria were found in  intact skin and  wounds, Hmean and 
Wmean, respectively. An AUC value closest to 1 identifies a 
genus able to separate the wound and intact skin samples the 
best. AUC values closest to 0.5 represent genera least able to 
separate intact and wound samples whereas values closer to 
1 are the most discriminating. These low AUC scores repre-
sent  bacteria  generally  found  at  low  amounts  or  similar  
levels in both groups of samples.

Table presents the Area Under the Curve, with values closest to 1 representing the most discriminating genera. The mean and standard deviation values for intact skin and wounds 
are presented in respective columns with "H" signifying intact (healthy) skin and "W" signifying wounds."NR" indicates a "not recovered" value. 

  The AUC  approach produces  synonymous results  to the 
student's  t-test.  Both  types  of  analyses  address  the  question 
of significant differences among groups. The AUC approach 
was  selected  to  provide  a  more  intuitive  and  statistically 
relevant representation of the significance levels. The bacte-
ria listed in Table 4, although prove to be highly distinguish-
ing  genera  among  intact  skin  and  wound  samples,  seem  to 
represent  relatively  low  composition  percentages  within 
samples. However, even at low percentages, certain bacteria 
may  play  a  significant  role  within  the  detrimental  biofilm 
contributing to  the overall  ecosystem. Furthermore some of 
the least discriminating bacteria, such as E. coli, are signifi-
cant  contributors  to  bacterial  environments  with  noticeably 
differing  levels  between  the  intact  skin  and  wounds.  The 
heightened  levels  evidently  seem  to  play  a  role  in  distin-
guishing  an  intact  skin  and  a  wound  environment  although 
the  AUC  level  may  not  reflect  that  (possibly  due  to  high 
variance between samples). 
 
Further  analysis  was  performed  to  show  the  most  
predominant  bacteria  in  intact  skin  and  wound  samples  in 
Table  5.  Several  genera  overlap  between  the  distinguishing 
Table  4  and  predominance  Table  5,  showing  the  bacterial 

genera  composing  majority  of  the  samples.  Chryseobacte-
rium, Segetibacter and Methylophilus are seen in both Table 
4 and Table 5, indicating some importance within intact skin 
samples.  
  Table 5 further shows that Escherichia spp. and Shigella 
spp.  represented  genera  in  wounds.  E.  coli  are  one  of  the 
most  prevalent  bacterial  species  in  the  surroundings.  Al-
though Escherichia were grouped with the least discriminat-
ing  bacteria,  possibly  due  to  a  high  variance  seen  within 
wound  samples  as  mentioned  earlier,  the  wound  samples 
within  which  the  genus  was  found  showed  higher  levels  of 
Escherichia  than  intact  skin  samples.  Furthermore,  Es-
cherichia and Shigella share many genes and have a similar 
genome  [32],  particularly  in  the  amplification  region  being 
analyzed  here.  During  this  study,  identification  of  tentative 
consensus  (TC)  sequences  was  performed  using  alignment 
principles. When  the sequence  in question was aligned  to a 
sequence  from  our  custom  database,  best  alignments  were 
considered.  Table  6  shows  all  occurrences  of  Escherichia, 
Shigella,  and  Serratia,  a  genus  also  related  to  Escherichia 
and  Shigella  [33],  and  the  counts  found  in  both  intact  and 
wound samples. Bacteria belonging to the Escherichia, Shig-

infections [34]. These values should all be considered due to 
  To ensure the existence of significant differences among 
the  close  relation  among  the  genera  and  therefore  possibly

(PCA) was performed. Fig. (1) shows the resulting analysis

Fig. (1). PCA for intact skin and wound data. The figure display the three main principal components to which the data was reduced to. 
The axes represent the values for principal components 1, 2 and 3. Points lying in the negative portion of an axis indicate a negative correla-
tion between the principal component and the sample. The two groups are denoted by different colors to demonstrate the separation between 
classes (intact skin vs. wounds). The ability to linearly separate the classes within the PCA figures indicates intact skin samples are different 
from wound samples. 

microbial composition of the samples is different and unaf-
fecting of each other. The PCA scores for the three principal 
components are displayed on the axes. Scores are results of a 
weight applied to the original data with the result indicating 
a negative or positive correlation with the component. 
  Hierarchical  clustering  was  also  performed  on  the  data 
with  the  results  shown  in  Fig.  (2).  The  intact  skin  and 
wounds  groups  are  separated  at  the  top  level,  dividing  the 
samples  perfectly.  The  dendogram  supports  the  previously 
discussed  results  indicating  the  ability  to  differentiate 
healthy  skin  and  wounds  based  on  bacterial  composition. 

Furthermore,  Fig.  (2)  also  demonstrates  the  lack  of  strong 
similarity  between  healthy  skin  and  wounds  for  the  same 
patient.  The  possibility  of  contamination  is  not  statistically 
supported by the results demonstrated in this image.  
  To  further  investigate  the  similarity  of  healthy  skin  and 
wound  samples  from  the  same  patient,  samples  with  pairs  
for a corresponding part of the body for an individual were 
studied  to  evaluate  the  extent  of  similarity  in  the  bacterial 
composition  of  the  samples.  A  similarity  measure  matrix 
representing  all  possible  pairs  was  created  and  can  been  
seen  in Fig. (3). The results of  the analysis demonstrate no

conclusive relationships between  an individual's wound and 
intact skin samples. The image in Fig. (3) shows the relation-
ship  between  each  intact  and  wound  sample  based  on  the 
Pearson's correlation distance. A distance of zero represents 
the closest samples, while a distance of two (scaled to 1 for 
the image) is the furthest. A color spectrum is used to repre-
sent  these  distances,  and  the  closest  distances  will  be  the 
coolest tones, closest to blue, while the furthest ones will be 
closer to the red colors. If the corresponding wound and in-
tact  skin  samples  were  similar,  indicating  contamination  or 
the flora of intact skin being strongly affected by the flora of 
the wounds (or vice versa), the blue color would be seen on 
the  diagonal  of  the  heat  map  matrix.  Judgment  should  be 
made  by  complementary  indices  on  the  x  and  y  axis,  
(i.e. sample 1 of the intact skin, corresponds to sample 1 of 
the wounds and the relationship between them can be seen in 
the top left corner of the matrix). Similarly, sample 2 would 
be in position (2, 2), and so on for  the rest of  the samples. 
The diagonal, however, is diverse in color, with the average 
Pearson’s  correlation  distance  of  0.78,  showing  a  relation-
ship  between  intact  skin  and  wounds  in  a  corresponding  
location. 
  A distance analysis was also done on all against all sam-
ples, not limiting to corresponding pairs. Fig. (4) shows this 
data. Unlike Fig. (3), a blue diagonal line can be seen, it rep-
resent  the  distance  between  the  same  sample.  This  forms  a 
logical deduction  that sample 1 (whether wound or skin)  is 
going to be identical to sample 1. Fig. (4) is useful for analy-
sis of distances of skin vs. skin, skin vs. wound and wound 
vs. wound. Within the analysis, there were 28 intact samples 
and 24 wound samples. The 28x28NW corner of the map is 
the distance within intact samples, 24x24SE corner is within

wound  samples,  and  the  rest  is  between  intact  and  wound 
samples.  The  matrix  is  symmetric  so  essentially  only  the 
upper  or  lower  triangle  requires  analysis.  The  sample  com-
parison again does not display an obvious pattern, however, 
evaluating the NE corner of the figure, the intact/wound re-
gion, it  is evident the area is primarily in the red tones fur-
ther supporting the conclusions drawn and discussed in rela-
tion  to  Fig.  (3).  The  correlation  distance  between  all  intact 
skin and wound samples is 0.79. In the SE corner, however, 
the  distances  between  the  wound  samples  appear  to  be 
closer. There is much more blue seen in the figure, showing 
closer correlations between the wounds. The increased inten-
sity of the red, however, offsets the closer relationships, re-
sulting in an average correlation distance of 0.77. The intact 
samples,  in  the  NW  corner,  although  do  not  have  as  much 
true blue tones as the wounds, have a greater amount of mid 
tones,  also  resulting  in  a  closer  correlation  that  the  in-
tact/wound comparisons. The average distance within intact 
skin samples is 0.70, the  closest of  all  three groups. Group 
analysis  of  intact  against  intact  samples  shows  the  lowest 
distance, suggesting the most similarity. The Pearson corre-
lation  distance  is  in  the  [0,2]  range,  thus  implying  the  dis-
tances of all three groups, being less than 1, are closer than 
the average random correlation value. 

DISCUSSION  
Diversity Analysis 
  The bacterial microbiota analysis results indicate there is 
a  significantly  lower  diversity  of  bacteria  found  in  wounds 
than  in  intact  skin.  More  sequences  per  sample  were  ana-
lyzed  within  wound  data,  intuitively  indicating  more  diver-

sity, however intact skin samples proved to be more diverse. 
This information, along with significance summaries can be 
seen  in  Table  3.  There  is  not  a  multitude  of  information 
comparing  healthy  skin  to  wounds,  however  a  number  of 
studies have shown the overall diversity of healthy skin to be 
considerable [35-37]. The more abundant flora of intact skin 
may be contributing to its robust environment and protecting 
the ecosystem from the spread of infection or accumulation 
of  opportunistic  and  pathogenic  populations.  Previous  
studies have  indicated  the properties of bacterial microflora 
of intact skin demonstrate advantages to the system [38, 39] 
and  thus  support  the  resistance  in  healthy  skin  and  the  
vulnerability  to  complications  witnessed  in  wounds.  The 
type of diversity data presented within Tables 1-3 is not able 
to precisely indicate what diversifies the two sets of samples. 
However,  this  type  of  analysis  is  an  established  means  of 
evaluating the overall species richness within groups [40].  

Composition Analysis 
  Table  4  indicates  bacteria  falling  into  genera  like Cory-
nebacterium,  Streptococcus  and  Anaerococcus  have  been 
shown to be associated with chronic wounds, and our results 
coincide with their findings. However, Table 4 also indicates 
intact skin to also contain Corynebacterium genera as part of 
the  predominant  composition.  The  percentages  at  which 
these bacteria are found, in wounded skin are higher indicat-
ing Corynebacterium as a significant opportunistic contribu-
tor  to  chronic  wounds.  Similarly,  Streptococcus  spp.  are  
often associated with wounds and in this study the genus was 
only found in 17 of 29 intact skin samples, at an average of 
only 1.54% (data not shown), compared to ~20% in wounds. 
This  is  evidence  for  elevated  levels  of  certain  bacteria  nor-
mally indigenous potentially contributing to wound biofilm, 
bioburden and polymicrobial infection. 
  Returning to Corynebacterium, these bacteria are recog-
nized  as opportunistic human pathogens [41].  Corynebacte-
rium genus harbors several species, including  Corynebacte-
rium jeikeium. This is a "lipophilic" and multidrug resistant 
bacterium  of  the  human  skin  flora  [42].  Corynebacterium 
jeikeium  shares  69%  of  its  genes  with  other  species  of  the 
Corynebacterium  genus  [42].  This  chromosomal  backbone 
allows  the  bacteria  to  be  toxic  and  prevalent  and  possibly 
drug resistant. This coincides with the fact and indicates the 
importance  of  the  observation  that  such  Corynebacterium 
were found at much higher levels in the wounds than intact 
skin samples. 
  Anaerobes have often been found in wound samples and 
are  recognized  as  a  major  population  in  chronic  wound 
biofilms [7, 43-47]. Genera like Finegoldia and Peptoniphi-
lus are part of the anaerobic bacteria group and are some of 
the most common genera found in the wound samples of this 
study  (Table  5).  This  data  agrees  with  the  previously  dis-
cussed importance and prevalence of these and other anaer-
obes [43, 48-53]. Anaerobes have been shown to be a uniting 
force  among  various  multi  species  groups  found  in  chronic 
wound  infections  [43].  Although  wounds  are  generally  ex-
posed  to  air  [43],  this  group  of  bacteria  may  survive  the 
harmful  effects  of  oxygen  by  symbiotically  existing  with 
aerobic bacteria, a process known as co-aggregation [54, 55]. 
It has also been shown that oxygen does not reach the inter-

nal  regions  of  biofilms,  leaving  the  harmful  and  prevalent 
anaerobes unaffected [56].  
Several  genera  seen  in  Table  5,  although  are  found  to 
 
occur in the top ten bacterial genera, are found in few sam-
ples.  Although  Wautersiella  spp.  and  Prevotella  spp.  are 
prevalent  in  intact  skin  and  wound  samples,  respectively, 
they  are not predominant within  those samples. Because so 
few samples contain the genera, little can be said about their 
importance.  
  Table 6 addresses the E. coli composition within wounds. 
Although  humans  generally  remain  unaffected  by  E.  coli 
presence,  opportunistically  E.  coli  can  cause  serious  infec-
tions. Intact skin can act as a barrier from E. coli infection. 
Due to a binding protein present at the surface of the skin, E. 
coli  is unable to survive and colonize [57]. It is evident the 
wounds  have  significantly  greater  bacterial  numbers  and 
work is well underway to elucidate these anecdotal observa-
tions.  Contributing  to  this  is  the  absence  of  functional  skin 
barriers,  exposed  tissue,  and  therefore  in  the  absence  of  
psoriasin, the binding protein protecting skin, E. coli is able 
to colonize and grow on the wounds.  

Comparison Analysis 
  The similarity analysis performed on the data using Pear-
son's  methodologies  resulted  in  supportive  results  for  the 
intact  skin  and  wound  samples  being  somewhat  similar. 
When the analysis was performed on paired samples, speci-
mens  extracted  from  the  same  individual  in  corresponding 
locations (for example a wound on the right ankle and intact 
skin  on  the  left  ankle),  the  correlation  distance  was  0.78, 
while  the  comparison  on  unpaired  intact/wound  samples 
results in 0.79. Because the paired and unpaired statistics are 
so  close  in  value,  it  cannot  be  concluded  that  the  intact  or 
wounded skin affects  the other. Although this number  indi-
cates  a  similarity  on  a  scale  of  0  to  2  the  average,  random 
distance between any two samples statistically should be 1, it 
cannot  be  concluded  that  an  individual  wound  should  be 
more  similar  to  the  corresponding  intact  location  than  it 
should be to any other person's intact skin. Because the Pear-
son's correlation distance we are dealing with is less than 1, 
this could imply that the flora of the wound may affect that 
of  the  intact  skin,  or  it  may  be  just  an  artifact  of  diabetic  
human flora. 
  The Pearson's correlation values from the unpaired analy-
sis  indicate  that  intact  skin  shares  the  most  similarity  with 
other  intact  skin.  A  similar  statement  can  be  made  for 
wounds. The statistics indicate that although the differentia-
tion can be made by a small margin, intact skin and wound 
samples are less similar to each other than to other samples 
within  their  group.  Ultimately  we  find  that  the  microbiome 
of  chronic  wounds  is  very  distinct  in  composition  when 
comparing intact skin and chronic wounds. It is obvious that 
the  chronic  wound  environment  promotes  propagation  and 
accumulations  of  key  opportunistic  pathogenic  populations 
supporting  the  concepts  of  functionally  equivalent  patho- 
groups.  Work  will  continue  to  more  fully  understand  
the  microbiome  of  skin  and  wounds  including  efforts  to  
elucidate  alternative  strategies  and  hypotheses  such  as  the 
potentials  of  probiotic  microbiota  that  may  promote  wound 
healing.
