The special architecture of neurons

in the peripheral nervous system,
with axons extending for long distances,
represents a major challenge for
the
intracellular transport system. Two recent
studies show that mutations in the small
heat shock protein HSPB1, which cause
an axonal type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth
(CMT) neuropathy, affect microtubule
dynamics and impede axonal transport.
Intriguingly, while at presymptomatic age
the neurons in the mutant HSPB1 mouse
show a hyperstable microtubule network,
at postsymptomatic age, the microtubule
network completely lost its stability as
reflected by a marked decrease in tubulin
acetylation levels. We here propose a
model explaining the role of microtubule
stabilization and tubulin acetylation in
the pathogenesis of HSPB1 mutations.

The peripheral nervous system is respon-
sible for exchanging information between
the central nervous system and the rest of
our body. To do so, peripheral neurons
project their axons throughout the body
over distances that can range from a few
millimeters up to one meter, in the case of
nerves connecting the spinal cord with our
hands and feet. This particular anatomical
architecture poses a significant challenge
on these neurons and requires an efficient
transport of proteins, RNA, vesicles and
organelles between the cell body and the
axon tip. This transport, generally called
axonal transport, is mediated by the motor
proteins dynein and kinesin and a highly
polarized microtubule network, in which
the microtubule-minus end is pointed toward
the cell body and the microtubule-plus

end points toward the axon tip. Micro-
tubules are cytoskeletal structures composed
of heterodimers of a- and β-tubulin; they
extend in all directions throughout the
cell
forming a dynamic network that
continuously grows, retracts, bends and
breaks. Therefore, rather than providing
cellular rigidity, microtubules are import-
ant for enabling dynamic processes such
as intracellular transport or mitotic spindle
formation that heavily depend on their
ability to be polymerized, depolymerized
and severed.1 The tight regulation of their

While all neuronal cell types depend
on an efficient axonal transport for their
function, peripheral neurons seem to be
particularly susceptible to disturbances in
axonal
transport, as evidenced by the
large number of cellular transport related
genes4-6 in which mutations specifically
lead to peripheral nerve degeneration.
Furthermore,
chemotherapeutic
drugs that target the microtubule network
cause peripheral neurodegeneration, which
is their major dose limiting side-effect.7,8
Missense mutations in the small heat
shock protein HSPB1 (also known as
HSP27) cause two types of peripheral
neuropathy: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
(CMT)
type 2F and distal hereditary
motor neuropathy (distal HMN).9 Both
diseases are very similar and clinically

ing in progressive weakness in the limbs
and wasting of foot and hand muscles. In

(A) Under normal conditions, there is a correlation between tubulin acetylation levels and microtubule stability. Acetylating and deacetylating enzymes
are able to control acetylation levels and maintain microtubule stability at healthy levels. (B) In the presence of the microtubule-stabilizing CMT-causing
HSPB1 mutants, tubulin acetylation levels do not reflect the degree of stability of the microtubule network. An increase in microtubule stability would
eventually trigger a cellular deacetylating response as an attempt to restore normal stability levels. Due to the discrepancy between acetylation and
microtubule stability levels, this cellular response results in an excessive loss of acetylation that reduces integrity of the microtubule network, impairs
axonal transport and causes neurodegeneration. *To simplify the model we highlighted only the tubulin acetylation levels in the figure. We recognize that a
complete model for microtubule stability control must also include the role of MAPs and other post-translational modifications.

mutations led to an increase in HSPB1
chaperone activity, which was associated
with an enhanced binding to their client
proteins.10 In a recent study we found that
the main targets of hyperactive HSPB1
mutants appeared to be tubulin and
microtubules.11 This anomalous binding
resulted in an increased stability of the
microtubule network in cells expressing

the hyperactive mutants,11
reminiscent
of the activity of classical microtubule-
associated proteins (MAP).12 Importantly,
we were able to confirm the enhanced
binding to tubulin and increased micro-
tubule stability in dorsal
root ganglia
(DRG) neurons isolated from 3 month-
old (pre-symptomatic) mice expressing the
hyperactive HSPB1-S135F mutant13 (see

also further). Intriguingly, the stabiliza-
tion caused by the hyperactive HSPB1
mutants was not reflected by an increase
in tubulin acetylation,11
a post-trans-
lational modification commonly associated
with increased microtubule stability.14-16
Furthermore despite being more in the
pause phase, microtubules

In another

study, d’Ydewalle
et al.13 describe that the mouse model
expressing the hyperactive HSPB1 (S135F)
mutation present at 8 months of age,
when symptoms are clear and axonal loss
became
apparent, markedly decreased
tubulin acetylation levels, which is an
indication of loss of microtubule stability.
Moreover, chemical inhibition of HDAC6,
an a-tubulin deacetylating enzyme,17 was
able to increase the acetylation levels of
microtubules in peripheral neurons and
rescue the CMT phenotype.13

Importantly, as mentioned above,

in
the same mouse model but at an earlier
age (presymptomatic state at three months
of age),
the opposite results could be
observed and an enhanced stability of the

these states might trigger the appearance
of symptoms.

How the transition occurs from an over-
stable microtubule network to a deacety-
lated and unstable microtubule network is
still unknown. Here we propose a simpli-
fied model where, under normal condi-
tions, the dynamicity of the microtubule
network in neurons is kept at an optimal
level by the controlled action of tubulin
acetylating (Elp3 and MEC-17)18-20 and
deacetylating (HDAC6 and SIRT2)17,21
enzymes (Fig. 1A). In disease conditions,
when neurons express
the hyperactive
HSPB1 mutants, there is a discrepancy
between the dynamicity of the microtu-
bule network and tubulin acetylation
levels (Fig. 1B). After an extended period
of increased microtubule stability the cell
triggers a tubulin deacetylating response
by increasing the recruitment of HDAC6
(or other deacetylating enzymes) to micro-
tubules in an attempt to restore normal
microtubule dynamics. This
response
results
tubulin
acetylation and, consequently, an extensive
destabilization of the microtubule network
(Fig. 1B). Moreover, the excessively low
levels of tubulin acetylation also reduce
the recruitment of motor proteins to the
microtubules.22 With a severely destabi-
lized microtubule network and a disturbed
axonal
these neurons
are not able to function properly and
degenerate.

the finding that acetylation is able to
control the binding of kinesin to micro-
tubules,22,24 the discovery that the lack
of the tubulin acetylase Mec-17 renders
microtubules unstable23 and the results
from Almeida-Souza11 and d’Ydewalle13
that we describe above, place tubulin
acetylation into the spotlight as an essen-
tial player in the function of the neuronal
microtubule cytoskeleton, especially in the
peripheral nervous system.

Despite the enormous advances on
the understanding of the role of tubulin
acetylation on the microtubule cytoskele-
ton,25 a lot of work remains to be done
to build a full picture on how this post-
translational modification is controlled
in neurons in vivo and how it interacts
with other microtubule dynamics regula-
tors. The modulation of tubulin acetyla-
tion levels has shown to be a promising
therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative
diseases.13,24 For that reason, a detailed
knowledge of this process is essential to
enable the development of efficient and
safe drugs for peripheral neuropathies and
possibly a multitude of neurodegenerative
diseases.
