Abstract:  Aims  of  this  study  were  to  investigate  on  antibiotic  resistance  and  molecular  epidemiology  of  K.pneumoniae 
producing  ESBLs  isolates  of  respiratory  tract  infections  in  some  major  hospitals  in  Iran.  K.pneumonaie  were  obtained  
of patients with RTI. K. pneumoniae producing ESBLs detected by screening,  confirming and PCR methods. During the 
12-month  period,  a  total  of  one  hundred  and  thirteen  of  K.pneumoniae  were  found  from  RTI  in  three  cities  in  different  
region  of  Iran  which  Sixty  seven  strains  (59.2%)  were  ESBLs  producer.  In  Ilam  hospitals,  seventeen  strains  (43.6%),  
in Milad hospital, thirty-seven strains (74%) and in Emam Reza hospital, thirteen strains (54.2%) were ESBLs producer. 
The  findings  showed  that  among  sixty-seven  K.pneumoniae  producing  ESBLs,  Sixty-three  strains  (94%)  were  positive  
for  blaSHV,  eleven  strains  (16.4%)  contained  blaTEM  and  sixteen  strains  (23.9%)  harbored  blaCTX-M.  Imipenem  
was  found  as  an  effectiveness  antibiotic.  In  the  current  study,  Majority  of  the  ESBLs  production  had  occurred  in  Milad 
hospital  in  Tehran  (74%).  In  conclusion,  spreading  ESBL-producing  strains  is  a  concern,  as  it  causes  limitations  to  the  
antimicrobial agents for optimal treatment of patients.

INTRODUCTION 

  Extended-spectrum  beta-lactamase 
(ESBL)-producing 
Klebsiella  pneumoniae  have  spread  rapidly  worldwide  and 
pose  a  serious  threat  in  healthcare-associated  infections  [1]. 
ESBLs  have  spread  threateningly  in  many  regions  of  the 
world  and  now  comprise  over  three  hundred  variants 
(http://www.lahey.org/studies). 

  ESBLs  are  plasmid-mediated  enzymes  that  hydrolyze 
broad-spectrum  beta-lactams  and  are  strongly  inhibited  
by  clavulanate.  ESBLs  are  transmitted  by  plasmids  among 
bacteria.  Furthermore,  antibiotics  such  as  trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones are 
often  co-transferred  on  a  resistance  plasmid,  resulting  in 
multiple  drug  resistance.  Thus  clinical  treatment  failure  oc-
curs  frequently,  especially  when  inappropriate  antimicrobial 
therapy  is  used  to  treat  infections  caused  by  ESBL-  produc-
ing organisms. Therefore, if infections with ESBL-producing 
organisms  can  be  predicted  by  the  clinical  characteristics  of 
patients, this may lead to a better selection of antibiotics and 
may improve the outcome of infections [2].

  This study was done to investigate on antibiotic resistance 
and  molecular  epidemiology  of  K.  pneumoniae  producing  
ESBLs  in  patients  with  respiratory  tract  infections  in  some 
major hospitals in Iran. 

MATERIAL & METHODS 

Sample  collection:  one  hundred  and  thirteen  clinical  iso-

 
lates  of  K.pneumoniae  were  identified  during  Mar.  2007  to  
Apr.  2008  in  five  hospitals  in  three  Iranian  cities  (Ilam  in 
west  of  Iran,  Tabriz  in  west  north  of  Iran,  and  Tehran  in  
center  and  capital  of  Iran).  K.  pneumoniae  isolates  were  
obtained  of  sputum,  tracheal  aspirates,  bronchial  washing 
and  bronchoalveolar  lavage.  Collection  of  multiple  samples 
of the same patient was, however, avoided in the database. 

Screening Stage 

  Kirby-Bauer  disk  diffusion  test  by  using  Mueller-Hinton 
agar  diminished  zones  of  inhibition  around  3rd  generation 
beta-lactam  disks  were  considered  suggestive  of  ESBL  pro-
duction. According to NCCLS (2005) the following antibiot-
ics were used to indicate ESBL production: cefpodoxime (30 
(cid:1)g),  cefotaxime  (30  (cid:1)g),  ceftazidime  (30  (cid:1)g),  cefteriaxone 
(30 (cid:1)g) and aztreonam (30 (cid:1)g) [3].

Clavulanic Acid Association Test 

For 

the  combined  disk  method,  disks  containing  
 
cefpodoxime  (30  (cid:1)g),  ceftazidime  (30  (cid:1)g)  and  cefotaxime 
(30 (cid:1)g) with and without clavulanic acid (10 (cid:1)g), were used. 
The  resulting  inhibition  zones  were  compared.  The  test  was 
considered  positive  when  the  difference  of  zone  diameters 
between  the  beta-lactam  disk  and  disk  containing  antibiotic 
associated with clavulanic acid was > 5mm [4]. 

Effect of non Beta-Lactame Antibiotics Against Klebsiella 
pneumoniae 

  Amikacin  (Ak)  (30ug),  cotrimoxazol  (Co)  (30ug)  cipro-
floxacin (Cf) (30ug), imipenem (I) (30ug) were used  among 
K.pneumoniae  producing  ESBLs  toward  non  beta-lactam 
antibiotics [5]. All antibiotic disks were obtained in HiMedia 
Company in India. 

Molecular Methods 

DNA Extraction 

  K.pneumoniae  Producing  ESBLs  were  cultured  in  LB 
broth  at  37°C  overnight,  and  then  DNA  was  extracted  by 
using the DNA extraction kit (fermenrtase). 

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 

  The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out by 
following  primers:  blaTEM  (Forward  5-GAGTATCAACA 
TTTCCGTGTC-3,  Reverse  primer  5-TAATCAGTGAGG 
CAC CTTCTC-3), blaSHV (5’–AAGATCCACTATCGCCCA 
GCAG-3,  Reverse  5–AAGATCCA  CTATCGCCCAGCAG-3) 
[6]  and  blaCTX-M,  (forward  5-ACGCTGTTGTTAGGAA 
GTG-3, reverse 5-TTGAGGCTGGGTGAAGT-3) [7].  

RESULTS 

  During  the  12-month  period,  a  total  of  one  hundred  and 
thirteen  of  K.pneumoniae  isolates  were  obtained  from  respi-
ratory  tract  infection  in  three  cities  in  different  part  of  Iran. 

Ghafourian et al. 

While  total  of  sixty-seven  strains  (59.2%)  produced  ESBLs, 
numbers  of  forty-six  strains  (40.8%)  were  non  ESBLs  pro-
ducer.  Generally,  amongst  ESBLs  producer  K.pneumoniae, 
all  the  strains  were  resistant  to  aztreonam  and  cefpodoxime. 
Cefotaxime  (68.6%)  allocated  the  lowest  resistant  among 
third  generation  of  cephalosporin.  Imipenem  were  found  as 
an  effectiveness  antibiotic  while  resistance  to  cotrimoxazol 
(35.8%)  was  more  than  the  others  (Table 1).  In  non  ESBLs 
K.pneumoniae  strains,  no  resistance  occurred  among  aztreo-
nam, while the highest resistance observed in cefotaxime and 
ceftazidime  (50%).  In  this  study,  all  the  non  ESBLs 
K.pneomoniae were susceptible to the whole non-beta lactam 
antibiotics (Table 2). In Ilam  city  in the west of Iran, thirty-
nine  K.pneumoniae  were  found  that  seventeen  strains 
(43.6%)  were  ESBLs  producer  and  twenty-two  strains 
(56.4%) were negative for ESBLs production; in Tehran city 
in  capital  of  Iran  (Milad  hospital),  of  fifty  K.pneumoniae, 
thirty-seven  strains  (74%)  were  positive  for  producing 
ESBLs and thirteen strains (26%) were negative on behalf of 
producing ESBLs and in Tabriz city in the west north of Iran 
(Emam  Reza hospital),  twenty-four K. pneumoniae obtained 
which  thirteen  strains  (54.2%)  were  ESBLs  producer  and 
eleven strains (45.8%) were negative. 

  Among  K.pneumoniae  producing  ESBLs,  25.4%  (n=17), 
55.2% (n=37) and 19.4% (n=13) strains were isolated in Ilam, 
Milad and Emam Reza hospitals, respectively (Table 1). 

  Results  revealed  that  among  sixty-seven  K.pneumoniae 
producing  ESBLs,  Sixty-three  strains  (94%)  were  positive 
for  blaSHV,  eleven  strains  (16.4%)  contained  blaTEM  and 
sixteen strains (23.9%) harbored blaCTX-M. blaCTX-M and 
blaSHV  together  were  present  in  fourteen  strains  (20.9%), 
nine strains (13.4%) carried both blaSHV  and blaTEM, four 
isolates (6%) were positive for blaTEM and blaCTX-M and 
finaly,  four  isolates  (6%)  carried  all  three blaSHV,  blaTEM 
and blaCTX-M. 

 
In  Milad  hospital,  all  K.pneumoniae  producing  ESBLs 
were  positive  for  blaSHV,  eight  strains  (21.6%)  contained

three genes were found in four isolates (10.8%). 

more of the K.pneumoniae isolates. The lowest K.pneumoniae 
producing  ESBLs  had  observed  in  Ilam  hospital.  Non- 
beta-lactam antibiotic resistance  in  Milad hospital was  more 
than  the  others.  Imipenem  was  found  as  an  effectiveness 
antibiotic.  

 
In  Ilam  hospital,  among  seventeen  K.pneumoniae  pro-
ducing  ESBLs,  blaSHV  was  found  in  thirteen  strains 
(76.5%), two strains (11.8%) were positive for blaTEM, and 
blaCTX-M  presented  in  five  strains  (29.4%).  Three  strains 
(17.7%) carried both blaSHV and blaCTX-M. 

 
In  Emam  Reza  hospital,  all  strains  were  positive  for 
blaSHV,  while  one  strain  carried  blaTEM  and  one  isolate 
was  positive  for  blaCTX-M  and  one  for  both  blaSHV  and 
blaCTX-M, as well.  

DISCUSSION 

  The high rate of  ESBLs among hospitalized patients  is  a 
global  problem.  It  is  generally  thought  that  patients  infected 
by  an  ESBL-producing  organism  are  at  an  increased  risk  of 
treatment  failure  with  an  expanded-spectrum  beta-lactam. 
The  prevalence  of  ESBL  producing  isolates  of  K.  pneumo-
niae varies in different countries [8]. 

  Countries  with  a  high  rate  of  prevalence  include  Turkey 
(60%),  Latin  America  (45.4%),  Western  Pacific  (24.6%), 
and Europe (22.6%) [9]. 

 
In  this  study,  ESBLs  production  was  variable  from 
43.6% in Ilam hospital to 74% in Milad hospital that showed 
different  frequency  of  ESBLs  production  in  different  region 
in Iran. Our study showed significantly high ESBLs production.  

  The  prevalence  of  respiratory  isolates  of  K.  pneumoniae 
with  ESBL  phenotype  has  been  reported  from  less  than  1% 
in Japan [10] to 83.3% in China [11]. 

  We  showed  that  the  percentage  of  respiratory  isolates 
with  K. pneumoniae was high.  Milad hospital contributed  to 

 
In  this  study,  susceptibility  testing  of  K.pneumonie 
strains  producing  ESBLs  showed  that  the  highest  resistance 
rate  among  3rd  generation  of  cephalosporins  and  aztreonam 
were cefpodoxime and aztreoname in all hospitals, cefteriax-
one  in  Emam  Reza  and  Ilam  hospitals  and  ceftazidime  in 
Emam Reza hospital. The highest non-beta lactam antibiotic 
resistance  occurred 
in  Ilam  hospital. 
Imipenem  was  found  as  effectiveness  antibiotic  among 
ESBLs producing K.pneumoniae strains.  

in  cotrimoxazol 

  Majority of the ESBLs production recurred in Milad hos-
pital  (74%).  The  highest  resistance  toward  non-beta-lactam 
antibiotic  was  observed  in  cotrimoxazol  (41%)  in  Ilam  hos-
pital.  The best antibiotics were Imipenem (100%) in all hos-
pitals  and  following  ciprofloxacine  (92.3%)  in  Emam  Reza 
Hospital.  In  non-ESBLs,  K.pneumoniae  Resistance  toward 
cefotaxime (76.9%) was more than the other antibiotics. The 
most genes responsible for ESBLs production were found in 
blaSHV.  In  Ilam  Hospital,  frequency  of  blaCTX-M  was 
more than blaTEM. 

In  Milad  Hospital,  Frequency  of  blaCTX-M  was  more 

 
than blaTEM. 

  Our  finding  in  Emam  Reza  hospital  had  showed  fre-
quency of blaTEM and blaCTX-M were as an equal. 

  The  prevalence  of  blaSHV,blaTEM  and  blaCTX-M 
genes in this study was 94%, 16% and 23.9%, respectively. 

 
In Iran, Feizabadi et al., in 2009 showed that 69.7% of K. 
pneumoniae isolates in Tehran were ESBL producers and the 
prevalence  of blaTEM,  blaSHV,  blaCTX-M-I  and  blaCTX-
M-III  among  these  isolates  were  54%,  67.4%,  46.51%  and 

94    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 

Ghafourian et al. 

29%, respectively (12). Our results revealed high prevalence 
of  blaSHV  and  low  frequency  of  blaTEM  and  blaCTX-M. 
Significantly, blaSHV was more responsible for ESBLs pro-
duction [12]. 

 
In  the  study  a  tertiary  care  hospital  in  Tehran  77%  of 
K.pneumoniae were ESBLs producer [13] while in our study 
in  Ilam  and  Emam  Reza  hospitals  frequency  of  ESBLs  pro-
duction were lower while the results of Milad hospital (74%) 
was near to the study of mehregan et al., [13]. In a survey by 
bazzaz  et  al.,  in  2007  in  general  hospital  in  Iran  59.2%  of 
isolates  were  positive  for  ESBLs  production  and  all  isolates 
were  susceptible  to  imipenem  [14],  our  finding  showed  all 
strains were susceptible to  imipenem. Our findings in  Milad 
hospital revealed higher ESBLs production as comparison to 
bazzaz et al., [14]. 

 
Shahcheragi  et  al.,  [6]  showed  that  ESBLs  production 
observed  in  33%  of  isolates  while  in  our  study  the  lowest 
ESBLs  production  was  presented  in  Ilam  hospital  (43.6%). 
All isolates in survey of shahcheraghi et al., [6] were suscep-
tible  to  imipenem  and  ciprofloxacine  resistance  was  ob-
served  in  32%  of  K.pneumoniae.  our  finding  revealed  all 
strain  were  susceptible  to  imipenem  but  the  highest  rate  of 
resistant  to  ciprofloxacine  was  observed  in  Milad  hospital 
and  that  was  21.6%.  In  the  study  of  shahcheraghi  et  al., 
69.6% of strains carried blaSHV and 32.1% of K.pneumonie 
producing  ESBLs  harbored  blaTEM  [6]  while  our  results 
showed all strains in Emam Reza and Milad hospitals carried 
blaSHV  and  this  was  76.5%  in  Ilam  hospital  (94%).  Fre-
quency  of  blaTEM  was  lower  (16.4%)  than  survey  of 
shahcheraghi  et  al.,  in  this  study  we  found  different  ESBLs 
production in different regions of Iran that one of the reason 
may related to population  in different city and also Using of 
antibiotic  in  Iran  is  uncontrollable,  use  of  antibiotics  and 
injectable  formulations  was  high  in  the  Islamic  Republic  of 
Iran.  The  high  number  of  prescriptions  for  antibiotics  (58% 
on average) may be because in the majority of the provinces, 
the  data  collected  only  covered  a  period  of  1  month.  And 
different prescriptions may have result of different resistance 
to antibiotics [15]. In conclusion, spreading ESBL-producing 
strains is a concern, as it causes limitations to the antimicro-
bial  agents  for  optimal  treatment  of  patients.  The  most  reli-
able  and  effective  antimicrobial  treatment  for  infections 
caused  by  this  organism  is  imipenem  [16]  and  also  had 
shown  in  this  study.  BlaSHV  was  found  as  a  predominant 
gene  responsible  for  ESBLs  production  and  future  study 
need  to  determine  type  of  bla  genes  responsible  for  ESBLs 
producing  strains  in  Iran  and  more  study  in  different  part  
of Iran.
