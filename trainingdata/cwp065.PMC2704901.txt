GalMBP is a fragment of serum mannose-binding protein
that has been modiﬁed to create a probe for galactose-
containing ligands. Glycan array screening demonstrated
that the carbohydrate-recognition domain of GalMBP se-
lectively binds common groups of tumor-associated glycans,
including Lewis-type structures and T antigen, suggesting
that engineered glycan-binding proteins such as GalMBP
represent novel tools for the characterization of glycopro-
teins bearing tumor-associated glycans. Blotting of cell ex-
tracts and membranes from MCF7 breast cancer cells with
radiolabeled GalMBP was used to demonstrate that it binds
to a selected set of high molecular weight glycoproteins that
could be puriﬁed from MCF7 cells on an afﬁnity column
constructed with GalMBP. Proteomic and glycomic anal-
ysis of these glycoproteins by mass spectrometry showed
that they are forms of CD98hc that bear glycans displaying
heavily fucosylated termini, including Lewisx and Lewisy
structures. The pool of ligands was found to include the tar-
get ligands for anti-CD15 antibodies, which are commonly
used to detect Lewisx antigen on tumors, and for the en-
dothelial scavenger receptor C-type lectin, which may be
involved in tumor metastasis through interactions with this
antigen. A survey of additional breast cancer cell lines re-
veals that there is wide variation in the types of glycosylation
that lead to binding of GalMBP. Higher levels of binding are
associated either with the presence of outer-arm fucosylated
structures carried on a variety of different cell surface gly-
coproteins or with the presence of high levels of the mucin
MUC1 bearing T antigen.

Introduction

The normal processes of glycosylation are often severely
altered during oncogenic transformation of animal cells
(Hakomori 1996). These changes can affect interactions be-
tween tumor cell-surface glycans and endogenous lectins, which
may determine the metastatic potential of the tumor cell. Several
common structural changes occur in tumor glycans, including
increases in the level of truncation and branching of structures as
well as an increased expression of unusual terminal sequences
(Kim and Varki 1997). These three changes often result in in-
creased exposure of terminal galactose residues, such as those
found in the cancer-associated T antigen (Gal β1-3 GalNAc)
and the Lewisx trisaccharide (Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc). One
potential role of galactose ligands in tumor cell metastasis is
highlighted by the correlation between increased expression of
the galectin family of galactose-binding proteins and the ability
of many tumor cell types to metastasize (Takenaka et al. 2004).
Galectins are thought to facilitate binding of circulating tumor
cells to cells of the vascular endothelium by binding to galactose-
containing carbohydrate ligands on tumor cell surfaces (Glinsky
2000).

Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies have proved to be use-
ful tools in the identiﬁcation of tumor-speciﬁc glycosylation
(Dube and Bertozzi 2005). For example, the CD15 epitope,
which corresponds to the Lewisx trisaccharide, is a useful di-
agnostic marker for Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma (Dorfman et al. 1986) and an antibody speciﬁc to sialyl-
Lewisa is used in diagnostic tests for progression of colon cancer
(Macdonald 1999). Characterization of human cell glycosyla-
tion with antibodies has been complemented by structural com-
parison of glycans on normal and tumor cells and by analysis
of changes in the complement of enzymes involved in glycan
biosynthesis in tumor cells (Kobata and Amano 2005). How-
ever, establishing how changes in glycosylation affect the prop-
erties of tumor cells requires a more detailed understanding
of how glycans are presented at the cell surface. Speciﬁcally,
identiﬁcation of proteins that carry tumor glycans is vital to
describing the cellular adhesion and subsequent processes that
enable the tumor cell to adhere to the endothelium (Hakomori
1996; Kim and Varki 1997; Takenaka et al. 2004). New tools are
needed because it is often difﬁcult to identify protein carriers
of glycan epitopes. For individual cell-surface glycoproteins,
the nature of the glycans bearing particular epitopes is largely
unknown.

Sugar-binding receptors of the C-type lectin family contain
structurally related carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs)
but display a diversity of carbohydrate-binding speciﬁcities
(Weis et al. 1998). Some receptors that contain C-type CRDs,
such as the selectins, interact with tumor cells and facilitate tu-
mor dissemination (Kim et al. 1998). Structural knowledge of
how C-type CRDs bind selectively to speciﬁc sugars has made

it possible to modify the sugar-binding characteristics of these
domains (Iobst and Drickamer 1994), raising the possibility of
creating CRDs with novel speciﬁcities for tumor glycans.

The results reported in this manuscript demonstrate that
GalMBP, an engineered variant of serum mannose-binding pro-
tein (MBP-A) that selectively binds to glycans bearing termi-
nal galactose, is an effective tool for identifying and purify-
ing tumor-speciﬁc glycans. This glycoproteomic approach has
allowed identiﬁcation of the heavy chain of the cell-surface
receptor CD98 as the primary bearer of Lewisx and Lewisy/b
tumor glycans on the MCF7 breast cancer cell line, including a
large population of novel, heavily fucosylated, multi-antennary
tumor-associated glycans. The ability of tumor cell lines of dif-
ferent origins to bind GalMBP varies widely and reﬂects hetero-
geneity in the levels of terminally fucosylated N-linked glycans
and mucin MUC1 bearing O-linked glycans with exposed ter-
minal galactose residues.

Results

GalMBP binding to tumor-associated glycans
A trimeric C-terminal fragment of rat MBP-A, consisting of the
CRD and an adjacent α-helical region, can be modiﬁed to bind
to galactose-related sugars by three single amino acid changes
and the insertion of a ﬁve-amino-acid glycine-rich loop to cre-
ate GalMBP (mutant QPDWG in Iobst and Drickamer (1994)).
In order to assess the ability of this engineered CRD to bind
speciﬁc sets of galactose-containing ligands, the carbohydrate-
binding characteristics of ﬂuorescently labeled GalMBP were
examined by probing a glycan array consisting of 285 natural
and synthetic oligosaccharides covalently linked to a chemi-
cally modiﬁed glass slide. The results show that GalMBP se-
lectively binds to glycans bearing terminal galactose residues,
with little binding to other glycans, even those containing termi-
nal N-acetylgalactosamine residues (Figure 1). Glycan 157, the

900

one ligand that does not contain a terminal galactose residue,
ends with a galactose that is modiﬁed with an α1,6-linked N-
acetylglucosamine residue. Thus, GalMBP can tolerate limited
substitution of the 6-position of galactose, although the presence
of 2–6-linked sialic acid prevents binding.

GalMBP shows preference for two distinct subsets of the 78
glycans bearing terminal galactose residues. One subset con-
sists of glycans in which a terminal α1,3- or α1,4-linked fucose
residue is adjacent to a terminal galactose residue, including
8 of the 20 ligands that give the strongest signals and con-
tain either the Lewisa (Galβ1-3(Fucα1-4)GlcNAc) or the Lewisx
(Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc) trisaccharides. Little binding is ob-
served to glycans containing terminal fucose in α1,2 linkage
(glycans 95–99 and 108). This observation is consistent with
the fact that the primary binding site in GalMBP binds galac-
tose and not fucose (Iobst and Drickamer 1994), so although
both native MBP and GalMBP can bind the Lewisx structure,
they must do so in very different ways, with fucose in the pri-
mary binding site of MBP and galactose in the primary bind-
ing site of GalMBP. Another 8 of the 20 best ligands contain
Galβ1-3GalNAc. A requirement for GalNAc as the subterminal
residue in this disaccharide is indicated by the lack of bind-
ing to glycans containing Galβ1-3GlcNAc (glycans 131–134)
or Galβ1-3Gal (glycan 130). The disaccharide Galβ1-3GalNAc
is the core 1 structure of mucin-type O-linked glycans, which
in an unmodiﬁed form is commonly referred to as the cancer-
associated Thomsen–Friedenreich antigen (T antigen). The abil-
ity of GalMBP to bind to the T antigen is also indicated by its
binding to glycan 278, where Galβ1-3GalNAc is presented on
a threonine linker.

Detection of GalMBP ligands on MCF7 cell surfaces
The selectivity of GalMBP for structures such as the T anti-
gen and Lewisx trisaccharide, which are expressed at increased
levels in a variety of cancerous tissues such as carcinomas, in-
dicated that the modiﬁcations made to create GalMBP might

Fig. 2. GalMBP binding to MCF7 cells and glycoproteins. (A) Binding of GalMBP or wild-type MBP-A to MCF7 cells was detected using a rabbit polyclonal
antibody to MBP-A, followed by a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Experimental data (symbols) are shown together with
curves ﬁtted to the data using a direct binding equation. The concentration of protein required for 50% of maximal binding was approximately 0.1 μg/mL for
GalMBP and 20 μg/mL for wild-type MBP-A. (B) Total cell lysates and biotinylated cell-surface proteins puriﬁed on avidin-conjugated beads were analyzed by
SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie blue staining or blotting onto nitrocellulose followed by probing with 125I-GalMBP. The
experiment was performed with low (L) and high (H) densities of MCF7 cells.

target it selectively to cancer cells. Binding studies with the hu-
man breast cancer cell line MCF7, which is known to express
Lewisx (Elola et al. 2007), showed that GalMBP binds to MCF7
cells with 200-fold greater afﬁnity than wild-type MBP-A does,
conﬁrming that GalMBP is able to detect high afﬁnity ligands
on these cells (Figure 2A). Speciﬁc glycoprotein ligands in the
MCF7 cell membranes were detected on nitrocellulose blots
probed with radioiodinated GalMBP (Figure 2B). The two ma-
jor glycoprotein ligands, migrating at approximately 75 kDa and
100 kDa, were also detected when MCF7 cell surface proteins
were biotinylated and puriﬁed on avidin-conjugated agarose
beads. Thus, GalMBP interacts speciﬁcally with a restricted
set of cell surface glycoproteins that are potential carriers of
tumor-speciﬁc glycans.

Identiﬁcation of glycoprotein ligands for GalMBP
Columns of immobilized GalMBP were used to enrich GalMBP
ligands in detergent extracts of MCF7 cells for further character-
ization. SDS–polyacrylamide gels of ligands bound to GalMBP
and released with EDTA revealed that the major Coomassie
blue-stained proteins retained on the column correspond to the
two bands of 75 kDa and 100 kDa identiﬁed in the blotting
experiments (Figure 3A). Probing with 125I-GalMBP conﬁrmed
that these bands are ligands for GalMBP, while the absence
of signiﬁcant binding of 125I-GalMBP to proteins in the ﬂow-
through and wash fractions demonstrated that the majority of
ligand was bound to the column. When the elution fractions
were pooled and repuriﬁed on the GalMBP column, which was
washed with high and low salt buffers before ligands were again
eluted with EDTA, only two Coomassie-blue stained bands that

were not recognized by 125I-GalMBP remained, at 35 kDa and
25 kDa (Figure 3B).

Proteomic analysis of the major bands in the repuriﬁed ligand
pool by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry demonstrated
that both high-molecular-weight GalMBP ligands comprise the
heavy chain of the cell-surface glycoprotein CD98 (CD98hc)
(Figure 3 and supplementary Table II). No other proteins were
identiﬁed across a range of search conditions. CD98hc con-
sists of a 58-kDa polypeptide backbone with four potential
N-glycosylation sites (Deves and Boyd 2000). The heterogene-
ity of CD98hc puriﬁed from MCF7 cells is presumably due to
variation in the number and the size of N-linked glycans, with
two dominant populations being evident. The 35-kDa band was
identiﬁed as the large neutral amino-acid transporter LAT1, one
of six light chains (CD98lc) that form disulﬁde-linked dimers
with CD98hc (Deves and Boyd 2000). The molecular weight
of the LAT1 polypeptide is 55 kDa, but the protein migrates
anomalously on SDS gels due to its hydrophobic composition
(Deves and Boyd 2000). The 25-kDa band was derived from
GalMBP, presumably as a result of limited proteolytic degrada-
tion of the column.

CD98 was originally identiﬁed as a surface antigen in lym-
phocytes and subsequently was found to be expressed in most
tissues and virtually all tumor cells (Deves and Boyd 2000).
CD98hc is required for cell-surface expression of the CD98lc
amino acid transporter (Nakamura et al. 1999). High-level ex-
pression of CD98hc therefore may be required for MCF7 cells
to produce large amounts of amino-acid transporter necessary
for sustained growth. At the same time, the CD98hc projects
an extensive array of glycans that could mediate adhesion to
the vascular endothelium and facilitate invasion of tissues. A

direct role of CD98hc in tumor-cell activation and adhesion
is suggested by the ﬁnding that crosslinking of CD98hc with
monoclonal antibodies speciﬁc to the CD98hc protein or car-
bohydrate blocks the proliferation of tumor cells (Yagita et al.
1986) and the demonstration that overexpression of CD98hc in-
duces malignant transformation of ﬁbroblasts (Hara et al. 1999).

Glycans on CD98hc
The proteomic experiments indicate that the heavy chain of
CD98 is the predominant ligand for GalMBP in MCF7 cells
and suggest that this glycoprotein may be the carrier for tumor-
speciﬁc glycans. The preference of GalMBP for Lewis-type
structures, coupled with previous reports of Lewisx expres-
sion on MCF7 cells (Elola et al. 2007), suggested that gly-
cans on CD98 that are recognized by GalMBP may con-
tain Lewisx. This idea was conﬁrmed by matrix-assisted laser
desorption-ionization time-of-ﬂight (MALDI-TOF) mass spec-
trometry analysis of N-glycans on CD98hc. The MALDI-TOF

902

proﬁle shows that the majority of molecular ions correspond
to large, complex-type N-glycans composed of 5–11 hexose
residues, 4–10 N-acetylhexosamine residues, and 1–6 fucose
residues (Figure 4). MS/MS analysis of the major molecular
ions coupled with the knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway of
N-linked glycosylation was used to predict the structures of the
main glycans present (Dell 1994). Many of the glycans identi-
ﬁed are tetra-antennary, with bi- and tri-antennary structures also
present at lower levels. There is evidence of substantial termi-
nal fucosylation but very limited terminal sialylation and some
high mannose oligosaccharides are also present. Sequences
predicted to be O-glycosylated are not found in CD98hc and
O-glycosylation of the protein has not been reported, so the
most likely ligands for GalMBP would be the N-linked glycans.
MS/MS analysis provided evidence that Lewisa/x, Lewisy/b,
and core fucose are present in all molecular ion peaks contain-
ing two or more fucose residues (Figure 5). All of the peaks
analyzed produced fragment ions at m/z 660, corresponding to
Lewisa/x. Diagnostic fragments corresponding to elimination of
fucose from the 3-position of GlcNAc indicate that Lewisx is
the predominant singly fucosylated terminal structure, although
some Lewisa termini may also be present. For example, the
dominant species at m/z 2591 consists of a bi-antennary glycan
with both of the antennae terminating in Lewisx (Figure 5A).
Similarly, a fragment at m/z 834 is present in multiply fucosy-
lated peaks, indicating the presence of Lewisy/b (Figure 5A–C).
Analysis of larger molecular ions revealed the presence of two-
and three-repeat poly-N-acetyllactosamine extensions bearing
one or two fucose residues, which have the potential to form
repeated Lewisx/a structures (Figure 5C–D).

Glycans on CD98hc as targets for cell adhesion
The detection of heavily fucosylated structures on CD98hc ex-
plains the selective binding of GalMBP to this protein and in-
dicated that it may provide a scaffold for interactions of MCF7
cells with endothelia (Elola et al. 2007). This suggestion was
supported by the fact that CD98hc is bound by the scavenger
receptor C-type lectin (Figure 6). This endothelial receptor rec-
ognizes Lewisx selectively and has been proposed to function
in adhesion of tumor cells during metastasis (Coombs et al.
2005; Elola et al. 2007). In previous studies, in which whole
cell extracts were blotted with scavenger receptor C-type lectin,
two lower-molecular-weight bands were detected (Elola et al.
2007). These bands, which appear to be proteolytic fragments
of CD98hc, were not observed when more stringent steps were
taken to prevent proteolysis during sample preparation.

Survey of GalMBP ligands on breast cancer cell lines
Based on the ability of GalMBP to bind glycans characteristic
of tumor cell surfaces, probing of additional breast cancer cell
lines was undertaken. Direct binding assays revealed that cells
of different origins differ in their capacity for binding GalMBP,
with higher afﬁnity binding observed for MCF7 and SKBR3
cells compared to ZR75-1 and T47D cells
(Figure 7A and
B). As a control, little binding was observed for MDA-MB-
231 cells, which are not believed to be of epithelial origin. The
differences in binding correlate partially with variations in the
levels of Lewisx epitopes on glycoproteins from these cells as
detected with two monoclonal anti-CD15 antibodies, with high-
est binding observed for MCF7 and SKBR3 cells (Figure 7C).

Fig. 4. Mass spectrometric analysis of N-glycans from CD98hc. Glycans released from puriﬁed GalMBP ligands were permethylated and subjected to MALDI MS
proﬁling. All labeled molecular ions corresponding to complex-type glycans were subjected to MS/MS analysis. The assignment for each ion represents the most
likely structure based on the precise ﬁt between the calculated composition and the m/z value, taking into account the biosynthetic pathways of N-glycosylation in
addition to the MS and MS/MS data. Values (m/z) listed correspond to 12C throughout. Satellite peaks surrounding major signals are either artifacts of the
permethylation process or are minor glycans with one or more sialylated antennae. The symbols are deﬁned in Figure 1.

Analysis of the N-linked glycans puriﬁed on GalMBP from
the additional cell lines conﬁrmed that SKBR3 cells display
multiple glycans with outer arm fucosylation, including tri- and
tetra-antennary structures, although the degree of fucosylation is
reduced compared to the MCF7 cells and glycans from ZR75-1
and T47D cells bear even fewer such structures (supplementary
Figure 1).

The relatively paucity of CD15 antigens and related epitopes
on the glycoproteins from ZR75-1 and T47D cells indicated
that there might be other GalMBP ligands on these cells that ac-
count for some of the binding observed. The ability of GalMBP
to interact with the T antigen suggested that O-linked glycans
displayed on cell surface mucins such as MUC1 could be addi-
tional targets (Burchell et al. 2001). The presence of such mucins
would not easily be detected by mass spectrometry because few
tryptic peptides can be released from the core polypeptide of
the mucin, so the presence of MUC1 was demonstrated by us-
ing a monoclonal antibody to probe gels of the GalMBP lig-
ands (Figure 7D). The blot reveals the presence of MUC1 in
the material puriﬁed from MCF7, SKBR3, and ZR75-1 cells.

Mass spectrometry of the O-linked glycans on glycoproteins
puriﬁed from the cells lines conﬁrmed the presence of T anti-
gen as the predominant O-linked glycan from all but the T47D
cells, in which the T antigen is mostly sialylated (supplementary
Figure 2).

These results demonstrate that the relative contributions of
fucosylated N-linked structures and O-linked T antigen vary be-
tween different breast cancer cell lines. In addition to differences
in the relative contributions of these two classes of glycans, the
different molecular weights of glycoproteins bearing CD15 anti-
gens on the different cell lines suggested that these are carried
on different protein scaffolds. This conclusion was conﬁrmed
by proteomic analysis, which demonstrated extensive variabil-
ity in the glycoproteins puriﬁed on GalMBP (supplementary
Table III). Although CD98hc, the predominant carrier on MCF7
cells, is also detected in the extracts from SKBR3 and T47D
cells, it is not the predominant protein present in these cases
and it is not detected in the case of the ZR75-1 cells. These
results suggest that the extent of tumor-speciﬁc glycosylation in
different cell lines may depend on the abundance of different

Fig. 5. MALDI-TOF/TOF spectra of permethylated N-glycans from CD98hc. Assignments of the fragment ions are shown either as loss of glycan moieties from
the molecular ion (see annotations on horizontal arrows) or as antenna fragments which are B ions for cleavage at HexNAc and C ions for cleavage at hexoses
(Domon and Costello 1988). Assigned masses correspond to the 12C isotope. The annotated ions not assigned in the schematics correspond to double or triple
cleavages. Symbols are deﬁned in Figure 1. (A) Fragmentation of the m/z 2591 molecular ion (Fuc3Hex5HexNAc4) produced ions at m/z 660 and 1954,
corresponding to cleaving off of terminal Fuc-(Hex-HexNAc). The presence of terminal Lewisx is demonstrated by the diagnostic ion at m/z 2385, resulting from
elimination of fucose attached at the 3 position of GlcNAc. (B) Fragments from the molecular ion at m/z 3838 (Fuc5Hex7HexNAc6) include ions at m/z 660,
corresponding to Lewisx/a, m/z 834, corresponding to Lewisy/b, and m/z 474 corresponding to core fucosylation. (C) Dominant fragments from the ion at m/z 5360
(Fuc6Hex10HexNAc9), at m/z 1109, and at m/z 4274 indicate the presence of a two-repeat poly N-acetyllactosamine bearing one fucose residue. (D) Fragmentation
of the ion at m/z 5809 (Fuc6Hex11HexNAc10) reveals the presence of three-repeat structures bearing one or two fucose residues at m/z 4100 and 4274.

clusters of binding sites and will facilitate creation of further
variants with modiﬁed selectivity for different sets of glycans.
In a recent study, isolation of ligands for wild-type MBP from
SW1116 human colon tumor cells by afﬁnity chromatography
revealed that unmodiﬁed rabbit MBP binds to heavily fuco-
sylated glycans, including those present on CD26 (Kawasaki
et al. 2009). The recognition mechanism of this wild-type pro-
tein is different from GalMBP because fucose would be the
principal sugar interacting with the binding site, but the best
ligands bear multiple fucosylated N-acetyllactosamine repeats
and thus would overlap with those bound by GalMBP. It is in-
teresting that this approach leads to identiﬁcation of a pattern
of glycoprotein ligands different to any of the breast cancer cell
lines, with CD26 and CD98hc identiﬁed as the major carriers of
glycans that react with wild-type MBP.

The glycan array proﬁle of GalMBP reveals a preference
for galactose-terminating glycans that either bear terminal fu-
cose residues or terminate in galactose-linked β1-3 to GalNAc.
GalMBP makes primary interactions with terminal galactose
residues (Iobst and Drickamer 1994; Kolatkar and Weis 1996).
The glycan array results indicate that this binding is enhanced
through secondary interactions with an adjacent terminal fucose
residue. The preference for terminal fucose shows some simi-
larity to that of the macrophage galactose receptor (Coombs
et al. 2006), but the selectivity of GalMBP for Galβ1-3GalNAc
has not been observed in other galactose-binding receptors. The
glycan array results demonstrate that, in the context of gly-
cans, GalMBP binds preferentially to galactose-terminated lig-
ands, which is distinct from the preferential binding to GalNAc
observed for the asialoglycoprotein receptor and the roughly
equal binding of galactose- and GalNAc-containing ligands
to the macrophage galactose receptor (Coombs et al. 2006).
These results indicate that further targeting to novel sets of gly-
cans may be achieved by additional engineering of the binding
site, employing the large body of information on the struc-
tural basis for ligand recognition by various C-type lectins
(Drickamer 1999; Feinberg et al. 2007) in conjunction with
rapid characterization of the speciﬁcities developed using the
glycan array.

In the presence of complement, full-length GalMBP binds to
and lyses erythrocytes pretreated with neuraminidase to expose
terminal galactose in the form of the Thomsen–Friedenreich
antigen (T antigen) on red blood cell glycans (Bray et al.
1981) (unpublished observations). The ability of GalMBP to
lyse neuraminidase-treated red blood cells highlights a poten-
tial therapeutic role for the protein either through complement-
dependent
lysis, by complement-mediated phagocytosis by
leukocytes, or by a complement-independent mechanism that
has been referred to as MBP-dependent cell cytotoxicity (Ma
et al. 1999).

Material and methods

Preparation of proteins
The C-terminal fragment of GalMBP was expressed by inducing
bacteria in the presence of Ca2+
as described for the scavenger
receptor C-type lectin (Coombs et al. 2005). Protein released by
sonication was puriﬁed on galactose-Sepharose by the method
used previously (Iobst and Drickamer 1994). Full-length wild-
type MBP-A was prepared following the published procedure

target proteins as well changes in the expression of components
of the glycosylation machinery of the cell.

Discussion

The results described here demonstrate that breast cancer
cells vary widely in the nature of their glycosylation in spite
of their similar origins and phenotypes, with two classes of
tumor-associated glycosylation present: branched, outer arm-
fucosylated N-linked glycans, and O-linked glycans bearing the
T antigen. However, the most abundant protein carriers of the
N-linked glycans vary dramatically between different cell lines,
with MCF7 cells being unusual in that a single glycoprotein is
the predominant carrier of the heavily fucosylated structures.
These results emphasize the importance of looking at more than
one breast cancer cell line when examining glycosylation differ-
ences. They also provide a molecular explanation of variability
in the response of breast cancers to treatments with antibodies
directed against carbohydrate epitopes (Mordoh et al. 1995) and
they suggest that screening may help to identify tumors more
likely to respond to treatment with anti-CD15 antibodies. In ad-
dition to providing an important tool for such analysis, GalMBP
can be used as a surrogate for endogenous receptors, such as the
endothelial scavenger receptor C-type lectin, that may interact
with tumor cell glycans during metastasis but which are much
more difﬁcult to obtain in quantities sufﬁcient for use as afﬁnity
reagents.

The fact

that GalMBP binds two subsets of galactose-
terminating glycans that are commonly present on tumor cells
makes it a powerful tool for identifying and analyzing glycopro-
teins present on tumor cell lines. Puriﬁcation of glycoproteins by
afﬁnity chromatography on GalMBP requires minimal sample
preparation prior to afﬁnity chromatography and the high yields,
coupled with the sensitivity of mass spectrometry, allowed char-
acterization of both protein and glycan components without re-
quiring radiolabeling or immunoprecipitation. The bacterial ex-
pression system for the C-terminal fragment of GalMBP allows
easy production of large quantities of trimeric protein with

(Wallis and Drickamer 1999). A version of GalMBP correspond-
ing to full-length MBP-A was expressed in Chinese hamster
ovary cells following the same strategy used for wild-type MBP-
A (Wallis and Drickamer 1997), except that the protein was pu-
riﬁed on galactose-Sepharose. The truncated form of GalMBP
was labeled with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate in the bicine buffer
(Powlesland et al. 2006) or with [125I]Bolton-Hunter reagent
(Coombs et al. 2005). The glycan array developed by the Con-
sortium for Functional Glycomics was screened using the stan-
dard buffer conditions (www.functionalglycomics.org). Scav-
enger receptor C-type lectin was prepared and labeled as previ-
ously described (Coombs et al. 2005).

Binding of GalMBP to cells
MCF7 cells were grown as previously described (Elola et al.
2007). Cell lines MDA-MB-231, T47D, and ZR-75-1 were
obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures, and
SKBR3 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture

Collection. Cells were grown in the media recommended by the
suppliers. Conﬂuent cells in 96-well plates were washed twice
with 250 μL of medium without phenol red, incubated with
wild-type MBP-A or GalMBP in medium for 30 min at room
temperature, washed four times with medium, incubated for
60 min at room temperature with a 1:800 dilution of anti-
MBP-A antibody in medium containing 5% bovine serum al-
bumin, washed again four times with medium, incubated for
60 min at room temperature with a 1:800 dilution of goat
anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (30
μg/mL) (MP Biomedicals, Illkirch, France), and washed four
times with medium and incubated with 100 μL of peroxi-
dase substrate (Pharmingen, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Reactions were
terminated with 50 μL of 2 M HCl and were centrifuged at
250 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were transferred to a 96-
well ELISA plate and the absorbance at 450 nm was read
using a Victor3 plate reader from Perkin Elmer (Waltham,
MA).

Afﬁnity puriﬁcation of ligands on immobilized GalMBP
The C-terminal fragment of GalMBP, 5 mg in 2 mL of 150 mM
NaCl, 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mM CaCl2, was coupled to
2 mL of Afﬁgel 10 (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) at 4
C
for 4 h following the manufacturer’s directions and equilibrated
in the loading buffer (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8,
25 mM CaCl2). Cells (2 × 225 cm2 ﬂasks) were grown to
conﬂuence, washed in PBS, harvested by scraping into PBS
followed by centrifugation at 450 × g for 2 min, resuspended
in the cell lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH
7.8, 2 mM CaCl2) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease
inhibitors, sonicated for 10 s and incubated on ice for 30 min.
Following centrifugation at 3500 × g for 5 min, lysate was
passed over the GalMBP afﬁnity column, which was washed
with the cell lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound
proteins were eluted with the elution buffer (150 mM NaCl, 25
mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mM EDTA) containing 0.1% Triton
X-100. For repuriﬁcation, elution fractions were pooled, CaCl2
was added to 25 mM, and the protein was again passed over
the GalMBP afﬁnity column. The column was washed with the
high salt loading buffer, in which the NaCl concentration was
increased to 1.25 M, and with the loading buffer, both containing
0.1% Triton X-100, and ligands were eluted in the elution buffer
containing 0.1% Triton X-100.

buffered saline. Radioactivity was detected using a Phosphorim-
ager SI from Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA). Probing
with anti-Lewisx antibodies was performed as previously de-
scribed (Elola et al. 2007). Blots were probed for MUC1 by in-
cubating overnight with hybridoma cell culture supernatant con-
taining monoclonal antibody HMFG2, provided by Joy Burchell
and Joyce Taylor-Papadimitriou (Kings College London), fol-
lowed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA).

Analysis of puriﬁed ligands by mass spectrometry
Solvents, acetic acid, and triﬂuoroacetic acid were purchased
from Romil (Cambridge, UK). Proteins present in elution frac-
tions from the GalMBP-agarose column were precipitated in
10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS–polyacrylamide
gels. For proteomic analysis (Abu-Qarn et al. 2007), bands
were excised, stain was removed by incubation in acetoni-
trile, and gel pieces dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Proteins
present were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol and alky-
lated with 55 mM iodoacetic acid, prior to digestion with se-
quencing grade-modiﬁed trypsin (E.C.3.4.21.4 Promega, Madi-
son, WI). Peptides were extracted from gel pieces by incuba-
tion with 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid for 10 min, followed by
the addition of acetonitrile for 15 min. The extraction pro-
cess was repeated once. Peptides were reduced in volume us-
ing a vacuum centrifuge and spotted onto a MALDI stainless
steel plate with α-cyano-4 hydroxycinnamic acid used as a
matrix.

Peptides were subjected to MALDI MS proﬁling, comple-
mented with MS/MS sequencing of the 10 most abundant
ions in each sample, on an Applied Biosystems 4800 MALDI-
TOF/TOF mass spectrometer. For peptide mass ﬁngerprint data,
peak picking was conducted using GPS Explorer software ver-
sion 3.6 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A signal-
to-noise threshold of 10 was used, sequazyme peptide mass
standards were used as external standards for calibration and
no contaminant ions were excluded. For MS/MS experiments,
peak list generation and database searching were conducted us-
ing GPS Explorer software version 3.6 (Applied Biosystems)
with the default parameters. Both MS and MS/MS data were
used to search 283,454 entries in release 54.2 of the SwissProt
database with version 2.2 of the Mascot database search algo-
rithm (www.matrixscience.com) with the following parameters:
peptide masses were ﬁxed as monoisotopic, partial oxidation of
methionine residues was considered, partial carboxymethyla-
tion of cysteine residues was considered, the mass tolerance
was set at 75 ppm for precursor ions and 0.1 Da for fragment
ions, and tryptic digests were assumed to have no more than one
missed cleavage. Peptide matches from both MS and MS/MS
data were used to generate probability-based Mowse protein
scores. Scores greater than 55 were considered signiﬁcant
(P < 0.05) (Perkins et al. 1999). In order to broaden the search
for other possible proteins in the GalMBP-binding fractions
from MCF7 cells, the mass tolerance for precursor ions was
increased to 100 ppm, taxonomy was broadened to include
all species, and the possibility of two missed cleavages was
allowed.

For glycan analysis, proteins eluted from GalMBP were
precipitated trichloroacetic acid and subjected to glycan re-
lease and permethylation as previously described (Sutton-Smith

907

A S Powlesland et al.

and Dell 2005). Samples were redissolved in 10 μL of
methanol:water (4:1), mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/mL
2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix and subjected to MALDI MS
proﬁling, with selected ions further analyzed by MS/MS. The
MALDI proﬁle of glycans in the major elution fraction from
the reverse phase cartridge is shown. Both MALDI MS and
MS/MS data were acquired on an Applied Biosystems 4800
MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer.

Analysis of GalMBP ligands by liquid chromatography and
tandem mass spectrometry
GalMBP ligands were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid,
lyophilized, dissolved in 25 μL of 8 M urea containing
10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated
with iodoacetic acid, and digested in solution with sequenc-
ing grade modiﬁed trypsin (Promega) (Foster and Mann 2005).
Tryptic peptides were dried on a vacuum centrifuge, resus-
pended in 80 μL 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid, desalted, and pu-
riﬁed by nano-liquid chromatography using an Ultimate 3000
(LC Packings, Dionex) ﬁtted with a Pepmap analytical C-18
nanocapillary. After loading in 2% acetonitrile containing 0.1%
triﬂuoroacetic acid, the column was eluted with a gradient from
8–45% acetonitrile over 60 min at a ﬂow rate of 0.3 μL/min.
Samples were spotted directly onto a MALDI steel target plate
using a Probot (LC Packings, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) with α-
cyano-4 hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. Samples were sub-
jected to MALDI-MS proﬁling with major peaks selected for
collision-induced dissociation and sequencing by tandem mass
spectrometry.

Fragment ions detected in the MS/MS spectra was used to
search the SwissProt database with the Mascot database search
algorithm (www.matrixscience.com) for peptide sequences con-
sistent with the ion fragments observed. For each search, the
parameters used were: peptide masses ﬁxed as monoisotopic,
partial oxidation of methionine residues considered, partial car-
boxymethylation of cysteine residues considered, mass toler-
ance 100 ppm, fragment ion tolerance 0.3 Da, tryptic digests
assumed to have no more than one missed cleavage, and taxon-
omy group searched Homo sapiens. Probability-based Mowse
scores were generated for each peptide sequence identiﬁed and
only values of greater than 95% signiﬁcance were considered
(Perkins et al. 1999). Positive identiﬁcation of a protein required
identiﬁcation of three or more unique peptide sequences identi-
ﬁed with ions scores of greater than 95% signiﬁcance. CD98hc
was screened for potential O-glycosylation sites using the Ne-
tOGlyc 3.1 server (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc).
