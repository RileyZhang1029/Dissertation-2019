Dynamic programming algorithms have been developed to compute the minimum free energy secondary structure and partition function of a given RNA sequence, the minimum free-energy and partition function for two RNA molecules, etc.
However, the applicability of dynamic programming methods depends on disallowing certain types of interactions (pseudoknots, inclusion renders structure prediction zig-zags, etc.
), as their an nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-complete problem.
Nevertheless, such interactions have been observed in X-ray structures.
Results: A non-Boltzmannian Monte Carlo algorithm was designed by Wang and Landau to estimate the density of states for complex systems, such as the Ising model, that exhibit a phase transition.
In this article, we apply the Wang-Landau (WL) method to compute the density of states for secondary structures of a given RNA sequence, and for hybridizations of two RNA sequences.
Our method is shown to be much faster than existent software, such as RNAsubopt.
From density of states, we compute the partition function over all secondary structures and over all pseudoknot-free hybridizations.
The advantage of the WL method is that by adding a function to evaluate the free energy of arbitary pseudoknotted structures and of arbitrary hybridizations, we can estimate thermodynamic parameters for situations known to be NP-complete.
This extension to pseudoknots will be made in the sequel to this article  in contrast, the current article describes the WL algorithm applied to pseudoknot- free secondary structures and hybridizations.

Indeed, the genomic information of retroviruses, such as the hepatitis C and human immunodeﬁciency viruses, is encoded by RNA rather than DNA, while the peptidyl transferase reaction, arguably the most important enzymatic reaction responsible for life, is catalyzed not by a protein, but rather by RNA (Weinger et al., 2004).
It has recently emerged that RNA plays a wide range of previously unsuspected roles in many biological processes, including retranslation of the     To whom correspondence should be addressed.
genetic code [selenocysteine insertion (Böck et al., 1991), ribosomal frameshift (Bekaert et al., 2003)], transcriptional and translational gene regulation (Lim et al., 2003  Mandal et al., 2003), temperature- sensitive conformational switches (Chowdhury et al., 2003  Tucker and Breaker, 2005), chemical modiﬁcation of speciﬁc nucleotides in the ribosome (Omer et al., 2000), regulation of alternative splicing (Cheah et al., 2007), etc.
A secondary structure for a given RNA nucleotide sequence a1,...,an is a set S of base pairs (i,j), such that ai,aj forms either a Watson Crick or GU (wobble) base pair, and such that there are no base triples or pseudoknots in S.1 For example, the secondary structure of Y RNA2 with EMBL access code AAPY01489510/220-119 is displayed in Figure 1a and b, while Figure 1c and d depicts the pseudoknotted structure of the Gag/pro ribosomal frameshift site of mouse mammary tumor virus (Van Batenburg et al., 2001).
In conventional dot-bracket notation, this latter structure is given as follows, where it should be noted that two kinds of bracket are needed due to the pseudoknot  AAAAAACUUGUAAAGGGGCAGUCCCCUAGCCCCGCUCAAAAGGGGGAUG ..............(((((.[[[[[[[.)))))........]]]]]]].
It is computationally intractable to compute the minimum free- energy tertiary structure of RNA  indeed, determining the optimal pseudoknotted structure is nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)- complete Lyngso and Pedersen (2000).
In contrast, by disallowing pseudoknots, secondary structure prediction is algorithmically tractable  there are dynamic programming algorithms to compute the minimum free-energy structure for a single RNA molecule, as well as for the hybridization of two or more RNA molecules.
In particular, such methods can be loosely grouped into two types of algorithm  those that use (i) a stochastic context free grammar to compute a covariation model and (ii) free-energy parameters obtained from UV absorbance (optical melting) experiments, in order to determine the minimum free energy structure (i.e.
thermodynamic-based algorithms).
Examples of stochastic context-free grammars are the programs Infernal (Nawrocki et al., 2009) and Pfold (Knudsen and Hein et al., 2003).
Examples of thermodynamics-based algorithms are the programs mfold (Zuker and Stiegler, 1981), UNAFOLD (Markham and Zuker, 2008), RNAfold (Hofacker et al., 1994), RNAstructure (Mathews et al., 2004).
Thermodynamics-based algorithms for hybridization of two structures are given in UNAFOLD (Dimitrov and Zuker, 2004), RNAcofold (Bernhart et al., 2006  Mückstein et al., 2006), while the NUPACK software considers hybridization of three or more RNA molecules.
(Dirks et al., 1A base triple in S consists of two base pairs (i,j), (i,(cid:1))  S or (i,j), (k,j)  S. A pseudoknot in S consists of two base pairs (i,j), (k,(cid:1))  S with i   k   j   (cid:1).
2According to Reinisch and Wolin (2007), one of the functions of Y RNA is to bind to certain misfolded RNAs, including 5S rRNA, as part of a quality control mechanism.

Such thermodynamics-based algorithms are particularly important, since the tertiary structure of RNA is believed to be largely determined by secondary structure, which acts as a scaffold for tertiary contacts  see Banerjee et al.
(1993) for experimental data supporting this view.3 Computing the minimum free-energy pseudoknotted structure for a given RNA sequence is NP-complete Lyngso and Pedersen (2000) for the Turner nearest neighbor energy model.4 For that reason, pseudoknot structure prediction algorithms fall into three categories: (i) exponential time exact algorithms, (ii) dynamic programming algorithms that restrict pseudoknots to a particular class and (iii) heuristic methods.
Examples of exact algorithms for pseudoknot structure prediction are the branch-and- bound algorithm of (Bon, 2009) and the method using tree-width decomposition of Zhao et al.
(2008).
Examples of algorithms that consider only pseudoknots of a particular class are found in the pioneering work of Rivas and Eddy (1999) and Lefebvre (1995), with subsequent reﬁnements in Dirks and Pierce (2003)  Reeder and Giegerich (2004) and Ren et al.
(2005) Examples of heuristic approaches include Monte Carlo methods Metzler and Nebel (2008), genetic algorithms Abrahams et al.
(1990) and a simple, yet elegant algorithm called ProbKnot (D.H. Mathews, to appear) that appears to be the state-of-the art method according to recent benchmarking studies.
Finally, it is beyond the scope of this article to provide additional background on algorithms for RNA structural alignment, motif detection or tertiary structure prediction.
As will be shown later, by Wang-Landau (WL) Monte Carlo methods, we can obtain essentially the same results as by dynamic programming computation of the partition function from UNAFOLD and RNAcofold  however, the advantage of the WL approach is that by extending the energy evaluation function for a given structure or hybridization, we can estimate the partition function for arbitrary pseudoknotted structures, known to be an NP-complete problem.
Before proceeding, we formally deﬁne a secondary structure  as follows.
Given an RNA sequence s= a1,...,an, a secondary  3There is some controversy about the extent to which RNA secondary structure constrains the tertiary structure.
See Cho et al.
(2009) for more on this point.
4The minimum energy pseudoknotted structure can be computed by maximum weight matching in O(n3) time for the simple Nussinov energy model (Tabaska et al., 1998).
structure S on s is deﬁned to be a set of ordered pairs corresponding to base pair positions, which satisﬁes the following requirements.
(1) Watson Crick or GU wobble pairs: if (i,j) belongs to S, then pair (ai,aj) must be one of the following canonical base pairs: (A,U), (U,A), (G,C), (C,G), (G,U) and (U,G).
(2) Threshold requirement: if (i,j) belongs to S, then j i   θ.
(3) Non-existence of pseudoknots: if (i,j) and (k,(cid:1)) belong to S, (4) No base triples: if (i,j) and (i,k) belong to S, then j= k  if  then it is not the case that i   k   j   (cid:1).
(i,j) and (k,j) belong to S, then i= k. For steric reasons, following convention, the threshold θ, or minimum number of unpaired bases in a hairpin loop, is taken to be three.

2 APPROACH The non-Boltzmannian WL Monte Carlo algorithm was developed by Wang and Landau (2001a, b) to estimate the density of states and partition function for complex systems, such as the Ising model, that exhibit a phase transition.
While the Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo algorithm samples low energy states, the WL algorithm is designed to visit states uniformly across all energies in a discrete energy landscape.
Indeed, for the Metropolis Hastings algorithm,   the expected frequency, or stationary probability, p mc(x) of visiting the state x, whose energy is E, is given by the uniform probability   mc(x)= e  E/RT 1 Z =(cid:1) g(E) times the Boltzmann probability p , where g(E) Z is the number of states having energy E and the partition function  E(z)/RT   in contrast, for the WL algorithm, the expected   wl(x)= frequency or stationary probability, of visiting state x is p g(E) E , where E is the total number of distinct energies E (in the  discrete case), or of energy bins (in the continuous case).
It follows that non-Boltzmannian sampling strategies, such as that devised by Wang and Landau (2001a, b), Kou and Wong Kou et al.
(2006a), etc.
are potentially useful in biopolymer folding, where one searches for a global energy minimum in a landscape having many local energy minima.
Indeed in Chen and Xu (2006), Chen and Xu applied the WL algorithm for the structure prediction of helical transmembrane  z e  1  [11:53 12/5/2010 Bioinformatics-btq218.tex]  Page: i279 i278 i286  i279   F.Lou and P.Clote  proteins, while the equi-energy sampling method of Kou and Wong Kou et al.
(2006a), related to Monte Carlo with replica exchange, has been applied to estimate the density of states for lattice protein folding under the hydrophobic hydrophilic (HP) energy model Kou et al.
(2006b), as well as in protein structure prediction by the fragment assembly Zhang et al.
(2009).
In this article, we apply the WL algorithm to compute the density of states and partition function for RNA secondary structure as well as for the hybridization of two RNA sequences.
We begin by validating and benchmarking the WL method against the exhaustive method RNAsubopt Wuchty et al.
(1999), that enumerates all secondary structures of a given RNA sequence.
Next, we compute the partition function over all secondary structures and over all pseudoknot-free hybridizations.
We describe as well how to compute   the partition function Z(T) over all temperatures from 0 C by performing two WL computations, followed by convolution calculations.
Although the computation of the partition function over all secondary structures and over all pseudoknot-free hybridizations can be done using the existent software RNAfold (Hofacker, 2003), respectively, RNAcofold (Bernhart et al., 2006), UNAFold (Markham and Zuker, 2008) and a recently published method of Chitsaz et al., the real advantage of our method is that by adding a function to evaluate arbitary pseudoknotted structures and arbitrary hybridizations, we can approximately compute the partition function, heat capacity, melting temperature, etc.
for a context known to be NP-complete Lyngso and Pedersen (2000).
C to 100     The density of states is deﬁned to be the absolute frequency function for energy  i.e.
density of states g(e) counts the number of states having energy e. In the context of RNA secondary structure, a state is a secondary structure for an arbitrary but ﬁxed RNA sequence s. In Cupal et al.
(1996), described the ﬁrst efﬁcient algorithm, running in O(m2n3) time, to compute the density of states for an RNA sequence of length n, where energy is discretized into m bins.
The program of Cupal et al.
(1996) is no longer available, since it has been superceded by the program RNAsubopt, developed by Wuchty et al.
(1999), which enumerates all secondary structures, whose free energy is within a user-deﬁned bound above the minimum free energy.
Though not documented, the RNAsubopt program additionally admits the option -D, which, instead of outputting structures, outputs only the number of secondary structures in each energy bin above the minimum free energy (bin size 0.1 kcal/mol).
3 METHODS Monte Carlo algorithms have been implemented by a number of groups, to study RNA kinetics of folding.
In particular, KinFold, developed by Flamm et al.
(2000), computes the mean ﬁrst passage time (MFPT) of folding, by using a variant of the Gillespie algorithm in an event-driven simulation with a choice of Metropolis Hastings and Kawasaki dynamics.
In Isambert and Siggia (2000) and Xayaphoummine et al.
(2005) a similar time-driven Monte Carlo simulation program, KineFold, is described to compute kinetically determine pseudoknotted structure for a given RNA sequence.
Danilova et al.
(2006) describe the RNAkinetics web server used to study the kinetics of the folding transitions of a growing RNA molecule, as in the case of transcriptional folding.
We now begin by providing background deﬁnitions and describing the  WL algorithm.

3.1 WL The WL algorithm, (Wang and Landau, 2001a, b) was designed in order to compute the density of states and partition function, neither of which can be computed directly by classical Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis Hastings algorithm, simulated annealing, replica exchange, etc.
Recall the deﬁnition of Markov chain.
Let Q= 1,...,n  be a ﬁnite set of (cid:1) states, let π=(p1,...,pn) be the distribution for initial state, and let P = (pi,j) j pi,j =1 for all i.
A be a matrix of transition probabilities, satisfying (ﬁrst-order, time-homogeneous) Markov chain M=(Q,π,P) is a stochastic process, whose state qt at time t is a random variable determined by  Pr[q0= i] = πi, Pr[qt+1= j qt = i] = pi,j.
i,j  = Pr[qt = j q0= i].
Clearly, the (i,j)-th entry Deﬁne pi(t)= Pr[qt = i] and p(t) of the t-th power Pt of P equals p(t) i,j   moreover, by time-homogeneity it = i], for all t0.
The stationary probability = Pr[qt0+t = j qt0 follows that p(t) of state i is deﬁned by limt pi(t)= p   i,j i , provided the limit exists.
It is a classical result that every ﬁnite, aperiodic, irreducible Markov chain has an equilibrium distribution of stationary probabilities  see the text of Clote and Backofen (2000) for a new, self-contained proof of this result.
A Markov   n is reversible, if chain with state set Q and stationary probabilities p for all i,j  Q, p  i pi,j = p     j pj,i.

It can be proved that the stationary probabilities for this Markov chain are given by the Boltzmann probabilities   p i  = e In contrast, Figure 3 presents pseudocode for the WL algorithm, which implements a random walk on the Markov chain whose transition probabilities pi,j of moving from state xi to xj are given by  , as shown in Clote and Backofen (2000).

In this case, the stationary probability of state xi is are given by g(E(xi))E  The mathematical justiﬁcation for applying the Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo method (Metropolis et al., 1953) to determine the minimum energy conformation of a biopolymer (Bradley et al., 2005  Das and Baker, 2007  Ortiz et al., 1998) depends on two facts: (i) every ﬁnite, irreducible, aperiodic Markov chain has a stationary probability distribution and (ii) if the Markov chain is reversible, a situation called detailed balance by the physics community, then the stationary distribution of the Markov chain corresponding to the Metropolis Hastings algorithm is the Boltzmann distribution, deﬁned by P(x)= exp( E(x)/RT , where E(x) is the energy of (cid:1) state (i.e.
conformation) x, R is the universal gas constant 1.986 cal/mol, T is absolute temperature, and the partition function Z is deﬁned by  x exp( E(x)/RT, where the sum is taken over all states x in the Markov  chain.
As temperature T approaches zero, the Boltzmann probability of the minimum energy state approaches 1, in the case of a unique minimum energy state, or more generally 1/m, in the case of m distinct minimum energy states.
See Clote and Backofen (2000) for details.

).
The structure T has 11 immediate neighbors, one of which is the empty structure S. Letting xi = S and xj = T, we have E(xi)= 0 kcal/mol, E(xj)=2.70 kcal/mol, ensemble free energy is  RTln(Z)=  3.96, hence Z =exp(3.96/RT) where T =310 C so Z =621.5 and we   =0.00161, p =0.00002,     have stationary probabilities p j i and pj,i = 1 pi,j = 0.012456  pi,j = 0.00161 0.012456/18=692.01 10   p i  pj,i = 0.00002 1/11=1.82 10   j Summarizing, in the Metropolis algorithm (with modiﬁed line 11), reversibility of a Markov chain depends on the permissible local moves, while in the Metropolis Hastings algorithm (with line 11 as in Fig.
2), reversibility is always ensured.
In the case at hand, if every secondary structure is an immediate neighbor of every secondary structure, then in the Metropolis algorithm, transition probabilities would be exp( E(xj)/RT)/Z N  exp( E(xi)/RT)/Z  pi,j = P(xi   xj)=min  11 .

In this case, an easy computation shows that the Markov chain is reversible.
Despite the non- reversible nature of the Markov chain corresponding to the Metropolis algorithm, whose states are the secondary structures of a given RNA sequence, and whose local moves consist of the addition or removal of a single base pair, it has been a standard practice to apply the Metropolis algorithm in this case (Danilova et al., 2006  Flamm et al., 2000  Isambert and Siggia, 2000  Xayaphoummine et al., 2005).
For that reason, we do not hesitate to apply the WL algorithm for the study of RNA secondary structure formation.
Note that in Figure 3, the WL computes the relative density of states, deﬁned by g(i)= N(ei)/N, where N(ei) is the number of states having energy ei and N is the total number of states.
In the case of RNA secondary structures, it is simple to compute the total number of secondary structures by dynamic programming, given as follows.
Given an RNA sequence of length n, let BPi,j =1 if positions i,j can form a Watson Crick or wobble pair, otherwise let BPi,j =0.
Let θ=3 denote the minimum number of unpaired bases in a hairpin loop.

(4)  E  In their original article Wang and Landau (2001a, b) mentioned that in the case of the Ising model, Equation (4) allows one to compute the partition function at any desired temperature T from the density of states.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the case for the Turner nearest neighbor model Xia et al., 1999 of RNA secondary structure, since the free energy parameters for stacked base pairs, hairpins, bulges, internal loops, etc.
all depend on temperature.
We can nevertheless proceed by computing the density of states for free energy at T =37 C, and the density of states for enthalpy (assumed to be temperature independent), and then by convoluting these values, we obtain the density of states for free energy at any desired temperature.
3.2 Partition function for a single RNA Figure 4a displays the relative density of states for the free energy of secondary structures of the 45 nt ﬂavivirus capsid hairpin (cHP) with EMBL access code AB010982/1-45.
Figure 4b displays the sum of squared differences between the density of states and the best ﬁtting normal distribution, respectively, extreme value distribution.
The cHP is a conserved RNA hairpin structure in the capsid-coding region of ﬂavivirus genomes.
Note that the relative density of states, or energy histogram, is approximately normal.
In Clote et al.
(2009) it is rigorously proved that the relative density of states is asymptotically normal  speciﬁcally, it is shown that the limit, as n approaches inﬁnity, of the relative density of states for an RNA sequence of length n is normal, where for the purpose of mathematical analysis it is assumed that any base can pair with any other base (homopolymer model) and that the energy of a secondary structure S is  1 times the number of base pairs in S (Nussinov energy model  Nussinov and Jacobson, 1980).
i282  3.3 Partition function of hybridization Following the approach in program RNAcofold of Bernhart et al.
(2006), we can modify the WL program of Figure 3 to compute the density of states for all hybridizations of two RNA sequences, where both intermolecular and intramolecular base-pairing is allowed, provided that there are no pseudoknots.
In the case of the hybridization of twoRNA secondary structures, the ﬁrst of length n and the second of length m, we can compute the total number of hybridizations as follows.
Given an RNA sequence A= a1,...,an of length n and an RNA sequence B= b1,...,bm of length m, let HPi,j =1 if positions ai,bj can hybridize, forming a Watson Crick or wobble pair, otherwise let HPi,j =0.
For 1  i,j  n, 1  k,(cid:1)  m, let Hi,j k,(cid:1) denote the number of hybridizations of the subsequence ai,...,aj with bk ,...,b(cid:1).
From Equation (3), we can compute the number NAx,y, respectively, NBx,y of secondary structures on subsequence ax,...,ay of A, respectively, bx,...,by of B.
If j   i or (cid:1)   k, then deﬁned Hi,j k,(cid:1)=0  otherwise deﬁne Hi,j k,(cid:1) by  Hi,j 1 k,(cid:1) 1 (1+HP(j,(cid:1))) (cid:8)j 1 + (cid:8)(cid:1) 1 +  HP(x,(cid:1)) Hi,x 1 k,(cid:1) 1 NAx+1,j HP(j,y) Hi,j 1 k,y 1 NBy+1,(cid:1)  x=i  y=k  (5)  It follows that the total number of pseudoknot-free hybridizations is then H1,n 1,m.5 The previous algorithm is clearly O(n4).
By considering the number of hybridizations to be the same as the number of secondary structures of a chimeric sequence, formed by concatenating A,B to form c1,...,cn+m= a1,...,an,b1,...,bm, we have an O(n3) algorithm, as follows.
For 1  i,j  n+m, if j   i or (1  i,j  n,j i  θ=3), then Ni,j =0, while if 1  i  n,n+1  j  n+m, then Ni,j =1  otherwise Ni,j is equal to  Ni,j 1+ j 1(cid:8)  k=i  BPk,j Ni,k 1 Nk+1,j 1.
It follows that the total number of hybridizations is then N1,n.
5In the literature, various types of hybridization are allowed.
In Dimitrov- Zuker (2004), no intramolecular structure is allowed, while in Bernhardt et al.
(2006) pseudoknot-free hybridizations are allowed with intramolecular structure.

4 DISCUSSION The Figure 5a displays the run time of the WL method, compared with that of RNAsubopt from the Vienna RNA package, while the Figure 5b of the same ﬁgure shows sample output from our WL program.
Figure 5 clearly shows the advantage of WL over existent methods in computing the density of states for both single RNA molecules and for hybridization complexes of two RNA molecules.
Figure 6a and b depicts the heat capacity computed by the WL method (Fig.
5a) and the program UNAFold (Fig.
5b).
Melting temperature, which is usually deﬁned as the temperature at which half of the molecules are single-stranded, while the other half are hybridized, is determined as that temperature where heat capacity achieves its maximum.
The program UNAFold does not allow any intramolecular structure (base pairing between 2 nt of the same structure), a feature that our WL method permits, as does the RNAcofold program.
While it is clear that additional work must be done to improve heat capacity computation with the WL method, the melting temperature TM computed by WL agrees reasonably well  i283  [11:53 12/5/2010 Bioinformatics-btq218.tex]  Page: i283 i278 i286   F.Lou and P.Clote  Fig.

(a) Comparison of execution times of WL and program RNAsubopt-D (Wuchty et al., 1999), in computing density of states.
Since the program of Cupal et al.
(1996) is no longer publicly available, and is superceded by RNAsubopt (private correspondence from.
Hofacker), we computed the execution time in seconds as a function of logn, where n is RNA sequence size.
Horizontal green line is slightly above the value of exp(25) seconds, or equivalently a day.
It appears that for sequences of length  46 nt, the WL method is more efﬁcient than RNAsubopt.

The leftmost column contains the energy bin, the middle column contains the relative frequency in the WL sampling run, and the rightmost column contains the lowest energy secondary structure in the associated energy bin.
Though our WL program allows the user to modify bin size, the default energy bin size (here) is 0.1 kcal/mol  empty bins, where no structure has yet been sampled, are not displayed.

with energy  3.3 kcal/mol, which is identical to the minimum free energy structure, as computed by RNAfold.
Only a portion of the output is displayed.

We now describe how to approximately compute the partition function Z(T) over all secondary structures and over all pseudoknot-   free hybridizations, simultaneously over all temperatures from 0 C to 100 C, by performing two WL computations, followed by a computation of the convolution of enthalpy relative frequency with free-energy relative frequency.
Similar computations using existent methods require over 100 cubic time computations.
Compute the relative density of states ph for free energy using WL with temperature T = 273 C (absolute zero Kelvin).
It follows that ph is the relative density of states for enthalpy, Due to the fundamental thermodynamic relation      G=  H T  S  (6)  where T (K) is absolute temperature and  G,  H,  S, respectively, denote the change in free energy, enthalpy and entropy.
i284  [11:53 12/5/2010 Bioinformatics-btq218.tex]  Page: i284 i278 i286     Compute the relative density of states pg for free energy using WL with temperature T =37   From Equation (6), we have that  C (310 K).
S=  H  G  .
T    Given arbitrary absolute temperature T, compute the relative density of states for free energy at temperature T by the following pseudocode, representing a kind of convolution of pg with ph.
1. for all z initialize p(z)=0 2. for x ranging over 3.  enthalpy bins  ranging over  free energy  for y  bins  4.
5.  z= x y  T  p(z)+= ph(x) pg(y)    Compute the absolute density of states g(z)= p(z) N, where N is the total number of secondary structures, computed by Equation (3).
C to 100  By this method, one can approximate the partition function Z(T) C, by performing two WL for all temperatures from 0 sampling runs, respectively, at temperatures  373 C, and then to repeatedly perform a fast convolution.
The method just described, which involves two WL computations, together with convolution computations, has until now not worked well in practice, for certain technical reasons.
This direction needs further exploration.
C and 37        Another issue concerning any sampling method is the required time to obtain reasonably good estimates of the quantity in question.
In the case of RNA kinetics, computations of MFPT to reach the minimum free-energy structure take inordinate amounts of time, when using Metropolis Hastings Monte Carlo methods, which are time-driven simulations.
For this reason, the program KinFold (Flamm et al., 2001) uses an event-driven simulation, where time is incremented by an exponentially distributed random variable.
It may be possible to use similar ideas to increase efﬁciency of our WL program, which should further improve the accuracy in the computation of heat capacity.
Finally, we intend to implement a new energy evaluation function, that allows arbitrary pseudoknots, zig-zags, etc.
using energy parameters from the recent dissertation of Bon (Bon, 2009).
This will allow us to estimate the partition function, ensemble free energy, heat capacity, melting temperature, etc.
for a context known to be NP-complete.
5 CONCLUSION In this article, we have implemented the WL algorithm to compute the relative density of states for RNA secondary structures and hybridizations.
Separately computing the number of structures and hybridizations, we obtain the absolute density of states, which then yields the partition function, and thence, in the case of hybridization, the melting temperature.
The WL method is much faster than existent software RNAsubopt in computing the density of states, but could not be benchmarked with the binning method of Cupal et al.
(1996) which runs in O(m2n3) time, for length n sequence and m energy bins, since the latter software is no longer available, being superceded by RNAsubopt-D.
In preliminary tests, we obtain roughly the same melting temperature for duplex RNA, as  Thermodynamics of RNA structures by Wang Landau sampling  that computed by existent methods  however, the real advantage of the WL method is that there is no restriction on types of allowed interaction, unlike the situation with dynamic programming approaches that disallow pseudoknots, zig-zags, etc.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank Michael Zuker, for a discussion on melting temperature and Ivo Hofacker, for informing us of the status of the program of Cupal et al.
(1996), and for explaining the undocumented option -D of RNAsubopt, which computes the density of states from the enumeration of all secondary structures within a certain energy range of the minimum free energy.
As well, thanks to three anonymous reviewers for their suggestions.
