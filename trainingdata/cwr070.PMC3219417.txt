Lectin), exhibited mannose-speciﬁc activity in a Ca2+-
dependent manner. Although FHL showed no homology
to any previously reported lectins, it did exhibit (cid:1)20%
identity to previously discovered plasma kallikreins and
coagulation factor XIs of mammals and Xenopus laevis.
These known proteins are serine proteases and play pivotal
roles in the kinin-generating system or the blood coagu-
lation pathway. However, alignment analysis revealed that
while FHL lacked a serine protease domain, it was homolo-
gous to the heavy-chain domain of plasma kallikreins and
coagulation factor XI therefore suggesting that FHL is not
an enzyme but rather a novel animal lectin. On the basis of
this ﬁnding, we investigated the lectin activity of human
plasma kallikrein and revealed that it could indeed act as a
lectin. Other genes homologous to FHL were also found in
the genome databases of some ﬁsh species, but not in
mammals. In contrast, plasma kallikreins and coagulation
factor XI have yet to be identiﬁed in ﬁsh. The present
ﬁndings suggest that these mammalian enzymes may have
originally emerged as a lectin and may have evolved into
molecules with protease activity after separation from
common ancestors.

Introduction

high-

proteolysis

The family of kallikreins, plasma kallikrein and tissue kallik-
rein, represent serine proteases deﬁned by their ability to
release
and
low-molecular-weight kininogen in blood plasma (Werle et al.
1937). The kinin-generating system has many important func-
tions including the modulation of blood pressure, complement
activation and the mediation of inﬂammation (Colman 2004).
Of the two kallikreins, tissue kallikrein is composed of only
protease sequence, while plasma kallikrein exhibits an
N-terminal heavy chain in addition to a C-terminal light chain
with protease activity. Much speculation has surrounded the
precise function of the heavy chain. Our discovery of a lectin
from the skin mucus of ﬂathead, a species of teleost ﬁsh,
appears to have solved this mystery unexpectedly.

Mature human pre-kallikrein, a precursor of plasma kallik-
rein, consists of 619 amino acids (Chung et al. 1986), and
activation of the pre-kallikrein to kallikrein is induced by clea-
vage at the amide bond between Arg371 and Ile372 resulting in
the production of a heterodimer consisting of an N-terminal
heavy chain and a C-terminal
light chain containing a
Cys364–Cys484 bond (Wuepper and Cochrane 1972). The light
chain includes a protease domain with catalytic triad residues.
The heavy chain contains four tandem repeats of “apple
domains” (Chung et al. 1986), homologs of which are also
found in coagulation factor XI (Fujikawa et al. 1986). Human
coagulation factor XI, which is a homodimer of 80 kDa sub-
units linked by a disulﬁde bond, is also a serine protease that
acts in the blood clotting pathway in plasma (Fujikawa et al.
1986). The precise biochemical

vertebrate species including teleosts, while plasma kallikrein

In the process of our comprehensive investigations on
lectins, which represent a diverse group of carbohydrate–
binding proteins in the skin mucus of many ﬁsh species, we
discovered a novel lectin, named FHL (FlatHead Lectin), in
the
(Scorpaeniformes).
Interestingly, this lectin exhibited structural similarity to the
heavy-chain domain in plasma kallikrein, which has yet to be
identiﬁed in any teleost species. We propose to deﬁne a new
family of animal lectins, named “kalliklectins”, into which the
various types of lectins should be classiﬁed. Our ﬁndings
prompted us to examine the lectin activity of human plasma
kallikrein, and we were successful in providing new evidence
of a new functional role for this enzyme. Searches of genome
databases suggested that kalliklectin is widely distributed in
ﬁsh, but not in mammals. Here, we report essential character-
istics and the primary structure of our novel lectin and discuss
our results in terms of the evolutionary relationships between
kallikreins, coagulation factor XI and kalliklectin.

liquid

Based on the amino acid sequence of L2, we synthesized a
degenerate primer to use in 3′ RACE (rapid ampliﬁcation of
cDNA end). Subsequently, 5′ RACE was performed with a
gene-speciﬁc primer designed to the nucleotide sequence
obtained by 3′ RACE. The complete cDNA for the protein
spanned 1426 bp, including 1134 bp of open reading frame
encoding 378 amino acids (Figure 2). The signal peptide was
putatively determined to be composed of 20 amino acids
releasing a mature protein of 358 amino acids.

We found that the nucleotide sequence for FHL exhibited
some polymorphic nucleotides. Speciﬁcally, of the 13 clones
analyzed, 7 clones contained C61, T77, C125, G135, T137, T260
and A696, whereas the remaining 6 clones contained A61, C77,
T125, C135, G137, C260 and G696. This variation may result in
the production of two types of FHL protein; one with Val17
and Lys204 and the other with Leu17 and Glu204 (Figure 2).
These proteins exhibited a high sequence identity with each
other (99.5%), suggesting that these were allelic variants or
recently duplicated genes. The deduced amino acid sequences
included all three of the internal sequences obtained from the
fragments digested by lysyl endopeptidase (Figure 2). The cal-
culated molecular mass of the mature protein was (cid:1)41 kDa,
which was in good agreement with that estimated by SDS–
PAGE analysis (Figure 1, lane 4).

Although no lectins share sequence homology with FHL,
we found that plasma kallikreins and coagulation factor XIs
in Xenopus laevis and mammals exhibited low e-values (<6 ×
1023) in a homology search (Table I). However, we observed
a 250-residue deletion at the C-terminal end in the ﬂathead

FHL when compared with mammalian and X. laevis kallik-
reins and coagulation factor XIs (Figure 3). The full-length
amino acid sequence of FHL is (cid:1)27.7% identical with the
heavy chains of plasma kallikreins and coagulation factor XIs
(Table I); heavy chains representing one of the subunits of the
activated form.

Gene expression of FHL in various tissues
Reverse transcription (RT)–polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analysis, with two speciﬁc primers (−3 and −4), yielded posi-
tive bands for FHL of predicted size ((cid:1)1000 bp) in samples
from the skin, gill, esophagus and liver whereas the stomach,
intestine, kidney, heart, spleen, ovary and muscle were nega-
tive (Figure 4).

Homologous genes in other species
We performed a BLASTP search with the full-length FHL
protein against the genome sequence databases of four ﬁsh,
and two mammals to investigate whether homologous genes
were present in other animals. In the fugu genome database, a
predicted protein (GENSCANSLICE00000025120), which
was found on scaffold_755 at locations 1915–4673, showed
the lowest e-value (1.4 × 1089), and 39.1% identity to FHL.
Tetraodon and medaka genome databases also gave us two
FHL-like transcripts, GIDT00014929001 (5.5 × 10110, 41.3%
identity) and GENSCAN00000012567 (1.4 × 1093, 41.5%
identity). It is notable that these genes coding FHL-like pro-
teins possess stop codons corresponding to that of the FHL
gene such that the predicted proteins also lack a serine pro-
tease domain, just like FHL. On the other hand, we could not
verify the presence of an FHL-like sequence in the zebraﬁsh
genome database, because e-values of predicted proteins were
not so low (>3.8 × 109). In the mouse genome database, there

kallikrein might act as a lectin. Human plasma kallikrein
exhibited hemagglutination activity (Figure 5). Fetuin having
multiple types of sugars inhibited the agglutination (Figure 5),
indicating that the hemagglutination was caused by the sugar-
binding ability in human plasma kallikrein. However,
the
hemagglutination was not inhibited by mannose and lactose
(data not shown).

Discussion

This study provides two important advances. One is the dis-
covery of a novel lectin from the mucus of ﬁsh skin. As
already reported, various types of lectins, many of which are
quite unique, have been identiﬁed from the body surface of
ﬁsh (Muramoto and Kamiya 1992; Muramoto et al. 1999;
Tasumi et al. 2002, 2004; Tsutsui et al. 2003, 2007, 2009;
Okamoto et al. 2005). In the present study, we describe FHL,
a novel molecule which provides additional knowledge con-
cerning the diversity of lectins from the mucus of ﬁsh skin.
The other advance is the discovery of a new functional role of
mammalian plasma kallikrein, namely lectin activity.
Its
potential impact is highly signiﬁcant since lectins relate to the
recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and our
discovery may lead to further advancement of our present
understanding of mammalian plasma kallikreins in self-
defense mechanisms.

This paper reports the puriﬁcation, characterization and
sequencing of a unique protein from ﬂathead skin with
similar structure to plasma kallikrein and its homolog, coagu-
lation factor XI. However, it was notable that the ﬂathead
protein completely lacked a serine protease domain including
a cleavage site and catalytic triad residues
(Figure 3).
In addition, this protein has binding activity to mannose in a
Ca2+-dependent manner. Since lectins are deﬁned as carbo-
hydrate–binding proteins that are neither antibodies against
sugars nor enzymes whose substrates are saccharides (Sharon
and Lis 1972), the ﬂathead protein should be classiﬁed as a

an FHL-like sequence, which also lacks a serine protease
domain, from a cDNA library derived from the skin of goose-
ﬁsh Lophiomus setigerus (Lophiiformes; accession number
AB291615). These ﬁndings suggest that FHL-like proteins are
widely distributed in ﬁsh species. Here, we propose to deﬁne
a new family of animal lectins, named “kalliklectins”, into

Fetuin inhibited hemagglutination activity of human plasma
kallikrein (Figure 5), but mannose and lactose did not.
Substitution of amino acid residues in the carbohydrate recog-
nition domain often results in alteration of speciﬁc sugar; for
example, alteration of
the Glu-Pro-Asn sequence to the
Gln-Pro-Asp in a C-type lectin induces the change of recog-
nized sugar from mannose to lactose (Drickamer 1992). Our
data suggest that mammalian plasma kallikreins bind to other
carbohydrate than mannose because of the substitution of an
amino acid sequence.

RT–PCR clearly demonstrated that ﬂathead FHL was
widely produced in the skin, gill, esophagus and liver
(Figure 4). This was in contrast to the case of mammalian
plasma kallikrein and coagulation factor XI, which are predo-
minantly
pre-kallikrein
(Ciechanowicz et al. 1993). The expression of FHL in the
liver may imply that FHL produced in the liver is secreted
into the blood plasma in a similar manner as mammalian
plasma kallikrein and coagulation factor XI.

Another type of kallikrein, called “tissue kallikrein”,

is
found in various tissues of many vertebrate species including
teleosts (Richards et al. 1997). This type of kallikrein has
been detected in the skin mucus of salmon Salmo salar,
where it is believed to function as a self-defense factor since
levels elevate following challenge with several bacterial
pathogens (Haussmann et al. 2006). However, this molecule
is clearly different from FHL. Tissue kallikrein contains a
serine protease domain but lacks lectin domains. On the other
hand, FHL, which lacks a protease domain, does not function
in the kinin-generating system or
the blood coagulation
pathway. The skin of ﬁsh is constantly exposed to water-born
pathogens. Thus, the fact that FHL exhibits binding activity to
mannose may act as a pattern recognition protein in the self-
defense system operating on the skin surface of ﬂathead in a
similar manner as other skin mucus lectins with agglutination
activities against some bacteria, as well as opsonic activities
(Kamiya and Shimizu 1980; Kamiya et al. 1988; Tasumi et al.
2002, 2004; Nakamura et al. 2006; Tsutsui et al. 2006, 2007).
Functional studies are required to investigate why the ﬂathead
secrets a plasma kallikrein-like lectin into the skin mucus.

To our knowledge, plasma kallikrein and coagulation factor
XI genes have yet to be identiﬁed in ﬁsh, although kallikrein-
like
sequences have been obtained from brook trout

sion no. AB242321). Jiang and Doolitle (2003) also reported
that they could not identify genes homologous to plasma kal-
likrein or coagulation factor XI in the fugu genome database.
These facts suggest that ﬁsh lack plasma kallikrein and coagu-
lation factor XI.
identify the
kalliklectin-like sequences in either the human or the mouse
genome databases, although these sequences were found in
some ﬁsh genome databases. This ﬁnding may mean that
mammals do not have this type of lectin. We also clearly
demonstrated that human plasma kallikrein exhibits lectin
activity (Figure 5). Because one human plasma kallikrein
molecule contains a single heavy chain, our results may
suggest that the heavy chain contains multiple carbohydrate
recognition domains; four tandem-repeated apple domains are
likely to possess the domains. The lectin activity of human
plasma kallikrein may cause substrate speciﬁcity, since kinino-
gen,
is a glycoprotein.
Structural relationships and the possible distribution of these
molecules in ﬁsh and mammals are shown in Figure 6. Based
on these ﬁndings, we propose the hypothesis that kalliklectin
and tissue kallikrein in ﬁsh are ancient forms of mammalian
plasma kallikreins and coagulation factor XI. Detailed
genomic studies on a wide variety of different species from
invertebrates to mammals are expected to reveal evolutionary
relationships among kalliklectin, coagulation factor XI, tissue
kallikrein and plasma kallikrein.

found in the genome databases of some ﬁsh species, but not
in mammals. We also discovered that human plasma kallikrein
can function as a saccharide-binding protein. These results
suggest that the origin of mammalian plasma kallikreins and
coagulation factor XIs may be a protein similar to ﬁsh kallik-
lectin, and these molecules have acquired enzymic activities
after separation from ﬁsh linage.

Materials and methods
Puriﬁcation of mannose-binding protein
Skin mucus from ﬂathead was homogenized with 2 volumes
of PBS containing 0.9 mM CaCl2 and 0.33 mM MgCl2 (PBS
(+)). The homogenate was then centrifuged and the super-
natant loaded onto a column packed with mannose-agarose
saline suspension (Sigma). The column was then washed with
PBS (+), and the bound protein eluted with PBS (+) contain-
ing 50 mM mannose. We then performed a hemagglutination
assay and an inhibition assay with sugars and EDTA using
the eluted fraction, as described previously (Muramoto and
Kamiya 1992).

Protein sequencing
Protein was puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography and subjected
to SDS–PAGE under reducing conditions. Protein bands were
electrically transferred from the gel onto a polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membrane (ATTO). After CBB staining,
the
N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein was analyzed
using a 476A Protein sequencer
(Perkin Elmer Applied
Biosystems). Enzymatic digestion was also carried out as
described (Muramoto and Kamiya 1992) to determine the
internal amino acid sequences of the protein. The digest was
separated by HPLC (Hitachi) on a TSKgel ODS-120T
reversed-phase column (Tosoh). Separated fragments were
also subjected to protein sequencing.

cDNA cloning
Total RNA was extracted from the skin of ﬂathead using RNA
extraction solution (ISOGEN, Nippon gene). First-strand
cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of the total RNA with the
SMART™ RACE cDNA ampliﬁcation kit (Clontech) for 5′
and 3′ RACE. Each PCR described hereafter was carried out
using an i-Cycler (Bio-Rad) in a total volume of 20 µL with
Taq-DNA polymerase (Takara) and 500 nM of each forward
and reverse primers.

At ﬁrst, we performed 3′ RACE with a degenerate
(primer-1; 5′-CARATHACICARTTYTTYAA-3′), correspond-
ing to the amino acid QITQFFN in fragment L2, and Nested
Universal Primer-A (NUP-A; Clontech) for 30 cycles at 94°C
for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and 72°C for 40 s. For 5′ RACE, a
gene-speciﬁc
5′-ATTTCCTGGGATG
TCAGTGTTGGG-3′) was synthesized on the basis of the
nucleotide sequence obtained by 3′ RACE. This was then
used in PCR with NUP-A. Thirty cycles of PCR ampliﬁcation
were carried out consisting of incubations at 94°C for 30 s,
58°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min.

Each of the PCR products generated was subcloned into
the pCR®2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was
then puriﬁed and sequenced with a 310 Genetic Analyzer
(ABI).

Computer analyses
Homolog searches were performed with the BLASTX
program
(http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/search/blast-j.html).
Alignment of the full-length lectin amino acid sequences was
carried out using Clustal W. The signal peptide in the
deduced amino acid sequence was predicted by SignalP
(version 3.0; http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/).

Gene expression analysis by RT–PCR
The isolation of total RNA and the synthesis of cDNA from
the skin, gill, esophagus, stomach,
liver, heart,
spleen, ovary and muscle were carried out as
kidney,
earlier. For RT–PCR analysis, FHL-speciﬁc
described
primers-3 and -4 were used with a protocol of 30 cycles at
94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min, giving a
product size of 999 bp. cDNA encoding for β-actin was
ampliﬁed as a positive control. The PCR products were visu-
alized by electrophoresis on a 1.8% agarose gel and staining
with ethidium bromide.

Genome database research
Genome databases of fugu (version 4), Tetraodon (version 7),
medaka (version 1) and zebraﬁsh Danio rerio (version 6)
were screened with the full-length amino acid sequence of
FHL as a probe using the BLASTP platform in Ensemble
Genome Browser (Sanger Institute, http://www.ensembl.org/).
This was carried out in order to investigate whether genes
coding for homologous proteins are present in other ﬁsh. We
also performed BLASTP searches against
the mouse Mus
musculus and human Homo sapiens genome databases
to survey the ﬂathead-like
(Ensemble Genome Browser)
sequence in mammals. Predicted amino acid sequences whose
e-values were <1 × 1010 were considered to have signiﬁcant
similarity and were subsequently aligned with the amino acid
sequence of FHL using Clustal W to analyze identity.

Hemagglutination test for human plasma kallikrein
Lyophilized human plasma kallikrein (Acris) was dissolved in
20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.8) containing 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM
CaCl2, 20 mM MgCl2 and 0.2% protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma) at a ﬁnal concentration of 500 µg/mL. To test the
hemagglutination activity of human plasma kallikrein, 12.5
µL of the solution was incubated with either PBS (+) or the
same buffer containing fetuin (1 mg/mL,
from fetal calf
serum, Sigma), 200 mM mannose and 200 mM lactose at
room temperature for 1 h. Then, 25 µL of 2% rabbit

1586

erythrocyte suspension was added and hemagglutination
activity assessed after 1 h.
