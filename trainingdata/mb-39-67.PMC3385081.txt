A  cell-free  extract  of  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  containing  the  angiotensin  I-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitory  peptide  was
treated  in  a  successive  simulated  gastric-intestinal  bioreactor  (step  1:  amylase  digestion,  step  2:  gastric  fluid  digestion,  step
3:  intestinal  fluid  digestion)  to  illustrate  the  absorption  pattern  of  antihypertensive  ACE  inhibitory  peptide,  and  the  ACE
inhibitory  activities  of  each  step  were  determined.  Total  ACE  inhibitory  activities  of  step  1,  step  2,  and  step  3  were  55.96%,
80.09%,  and  76.77%,  respectively.  The  peptide  sequence  of  each  steps  was  analyzed  by  MS/MS  spectrophotometry.  Eleven
kinds  of  representative  peptide  sequences  were  conserved  in  each  step,  and  representative  new  peptides  including  RLPTES-
VPEPK  were  identified  in  step  3.

Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (dipeptidyl carboxy pep-
tidase  I,  kinase  II,  E.C  3.4.15.1,  ACE)  is  the  key  enzyme
in  the rennin-angiotensin  system  [1],  which  catalyzes  pro-
duction  of  the  active  hypertensive  hormone  angiotensin  II
(Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe)  from  the  inactive  pro-
hormone  angiotensin  I  (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-
His-Leu)  and  also  inactivates  the  hypotensive  peptide
bradykinin  [2, 3].  This  conversion  endows  ACE  with  a
very  important  role  in  regulating  blood  pressure  through
the  direct  action  of  angiotensin  II  on  blood  vessels,  sym-
pathetic  nerves,  and  adrenal  glands  [2, 3].  ACE  inhibitors
have long been very useful because they inhibit both ACE
in  the  rennin-angiotensin  system  and  the  kallikrein-kinin
system [4]. Although some ACE inhibitors have been pro-
duced  and  characterized  from  several  natural  sources  [5],
few  are  used  commercially  because  of  their  low  antihy-
pertensive action  and  poor effectiveness  in  the  gastric  and
intestinal systems. In a previous study [6], we purified and
characterized an ACE inhibitor from Saccharomyces cere-
visiae.  The  present  study  describes  the  absorption  pattern
of  a  novel  ACE  inhibitory  peptide  from  alcohol  fermented
S. cerevisiae.

The  purified  ACE  inhibitor  from  S.  cerevisiae  character-
ized  in  a  previous  paper  with  an  IC50  of  0.07 mg  [6]  was
used  in  this  study.  ACE  was  extracted  from  rabbit  lung
acetone  powder  with  100 mM  sodium  borate  buffer  (pH
8.3)  containing  300 mM  NaCl.  The  extract  was  maintained
overnight  at  4oC  and  its  activity  was  determined  using
hippuric  acid-histidine-leucine  (Hip-His-Leu)  as  a  substrate
[1].  The  rabbit  lung  acetone  powder,  pepsin  (4,150 unit/

mg),  trypsin  (1,200 units/mg),  protease  N  (185 units/mg),
and  the  Hip-His-Leu  were  obtained  from  Sigma  Chemical
Co.  (St.  Louis,  MO,  USA).  Simulated  gastric  and  intesti-
nal  fluid  solutions  were  prepared  according  to  United
States  Pharmacopeia  specifications  [7]  as  follows.  For  the
simulated  gastric  fluid  (SGF),  0.2%  sodium  chloride  and
0.32%  pepsin  (from  porcine  stomach  mucosa)  were  dis-
solved  in  7.0 mL  hydrochloric  acid  and  a  sufficient  vol-
ume  of  water  to  make  1 L  (pH  1.2).  The  purified  peptide
(1 mg/mL)  was  added  to  the  SGF  and  incubated  in  a
shaking incubator (37oC, 120 rpm) for 2 hr. Digestion was
stopped by raising the pH to 7.5 using 1 N NaOH. For the
simulated  intestinal  fluid  (SIF),  0.68%  monobasic  potas-
sium  phosphate  was  dissolved  in  250 mL  water.  To  this,
77 mL  of  0.2 N  sodium  hydroxide  and  500 mL  water  were
added  and  mixed  along  with  1%  pancreatin  (from  por-
cine  mucosa)  (pH  6.8).  The  SIF  solution  was  adjusted  to
pH 6.8 with 0.2 N HCl and then diluted with water to 1 L.
The  SIF  was  added  to  the  digests  obtained  from  the
SGF  reaction  and  incubated  for  2 hr.  Then,  these  solu-
tions were incubated in a shaking incubator (37oC, 120 rpm)
for  10 hr.  The  final  SGF  and  SIF  digested  samples  were
lyophilized  immediately  and  used  for  measuring  ACE
inhibitory  activity  (IC50).  The  stability  of  the  purified  pep-
tide  in  SGF  and  SIF  was  analyzed  by  reverse  phase  high
performance  liquid  chromatography.  A  simulated  gastric-
intestinal  (SGI)  bioreactor  was  designed  using  the  gastric
and intestinal fluids as shown in Fig. 1.

ACE  inhibitory  activity  was  assayed  by  the  modified
method  of  Cushman  and  Cheung  [8].  A  mixture  contain-
ing  100 mM  sodium  borate  buffer  (pH  8.3),  300 mM
NaCl,  3 units  of  ACE  from  rabbit  lung,  and  an  appropri-

ate  amount  of  the  inhibitor  solution  was  preincubated  for
10 min  at  37oC.  The  reaction  was  initiated  by  adding
50 µL  of  Hip-His-Leu  at  a  final  concentration  of  5 mM
and  was  terminated  after  a  30-min  incubation  by  adding
250 µL  of  1.0 M  HCl.  The  hippuric  acid  liberated  was
extracted  with  1 mL  of  ethyl  acetate,  and  0.8 mL  of  the
extract  was  evaporated  with  a  Speed  Vac  concentrator
(Eyela  Co.,  Tokyo,  Japan).  Then,  the  residue  was  dis-
solved  in  1 mL  of  sodium  borate  buffer.  Absorbance  at
228 nm  was  measured  to  estimate  ACE  inhibitory  activ-
ity.  The  ACE  inhibitor  concentration  required  to  inhibit
50%  of  the  ACE  activity  under  the  assay  conditions  was
defined  as  the  IC50.  The  amino  acid  composition  of  the
ACE inhibitor from S. cerevisiae was analyzed with a flu-
orometric  analysis  system  (SLM-Aminoco,  Urbana,  IL,
USA)  after  hydrolysis  for  24 hr  in  4 N  methanesulfonic
acid  containing  0.2%  3-(2-aminoethyl)  indole  at  110oC
[9].  The  amino  acid  sequence  was  determined  by  the
Edman  method  [4],  using  an  Applied  Biosystems  491A
automatic  protein  sequencer  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster
City, CA, USA) [10].

We  determined  the  inhibitory  activity  of  the  purified
ACE  inhibitor  from  S.  cerevisiae  after  a  digestion  with
gastric  and  intestinal  fluids  in  the  SGI  bioreactor  (Table
1).  The  original  ACE  inhibitory  activity  (67.6%)  of  the
purified  ACE  inhibitor  decreased  to  56.0%  after  mouth
digestion (step 1) and then increased to 80.1% after stom-
ach  digestion  (step  2)  and  again  decreased  to  76.8%  after
digestion by small intestinal fluids (step 3). These changes
in  inhibitory  activity  suggest  that  some  ACE  inhibitory

peptides  were  produced  newly  or  decomposed  by  diges-
tion  with  pepsin  (stomach)  and  pancreatin  (intestinal).
Furthermore, the peptide sequences of the step 1, 2, and 3
hydrolysates  were  also  analyzed  by  MS/MS  spectropho-
tometry  (Table  2).  Eleven  kinds  of  peptide  sequences
were  conserved  and  ten  kinds  of  new  peptide  sequences
including  RLPTESVPEPK  were produced in step  3.  It  was
assumed that these conserved and new peptides sequences
were  very  important  for  antihypertensive  action.  There-
fore,  further  determination  of  the  ACE  inhibitory  activi-
ties of these conserved peptide sequences and new peptide
sequences is required.

Several  functional  peptides  are  absorbed  in  the  small
intestine.  Therefore,  the  step-3  hydrolysates  were  ultrafil-
trated  with  a  5 kDa  cut-off  filter,  and  the  filtrates  were
subjected  to  C18  solid  phase  extraction  chromatography.
As shown in  Table 3,  45%  of  the C18  solid  phase  extract
showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity of 74.2%, and
35% of the C18 solid phase extracts and 55% of the solid
phase  extract  also  showed  high  ACE  inhibitory  activities
of  69.9%  and  63.3%,  respectively.  Further  purification  of
the ACE inhibitor in the 45% fraction from the C18 solid
phase  extraction  chromatography  and  a  comparison  of  its
inhibitory  activities  with  the  purified  ACE  inhibitor  and
the  identified  peptide  sequences  from  SGI  bioreactor  are
also required.
