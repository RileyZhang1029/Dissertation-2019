The milieu in soil in which microorganisms dwell is never constant. Conditions such as
temperature, water availability, pH and nutrients frequently change, impacting the overall
functioning of the soil system.To understand the effects of such factors on soil functioning,
proxies (indicators) of soil function are needed that, in a sensitive manner, reveal normal
amplitude of variation. Thus, the so-called normal operating range (NOR) of soil can be
deﬁned. In this study we determined different components of nitriﬁcation by analyzing,
in eight agricultural soils, how the community structures and sizes of ammonia oxidizing
bacteria and archaea (AOB and AOA, respectively), and their activity, ﬂuctuate over spatial
and temporal scales. The results indicated that soil pH and soil type are the main factors
that inﬂuence the size and structure of the AOA and AOB, as well as their function.The nitri-
ﬁcation rates varied between 0.11± 0.03 gN h−1 gdw−1
and 1.68± 0.11 μgN h− gdw−1,
being higher in soils with higher clay content (1.09± 0.12 μgN h−1 gdw−1) and lower in soils
with lower clay percentages (0.27± 0.04 μgN h−1 gdw−1). Nitrifying activity was driven by
soil pH, mostly related to its effect on AOA but not on AOB abundance. Regarding the
inﬂuence of soil parameters, clay content was the main soil factor shaping the structure of
both the AOA and AOB communities. Overall, the potential nitrifying activities were higher
and more variable over time in the clayey than in the sandy soils. Whereas the structure
of AOB ﬂuctuated more (62.7± 2.10%) the structure of AOA communities showed lower
amplitude of variation (53.65± 3.37%). Similar trends were observed for the sizes of these
communities. The present work represents a ﬁrst step toward deﬁning a NOR for soil nitri-
ﬁcation. The sensitivity of the process and organisms to impacts from the milieu support
their use as proxies in the NOR of agricultural soils. Moreover, the clear effect of soil texture
established here suggests that the NOR should be deﬁned in a soil type-speciﬁc manner.

INTRODUCTION
The diversity of microorganisms on Earth is astonishing. Torsvik
et al. (1990) estimated the number of bacterial genomes in a mixed
sample using DNA:DNA hybridization. The number of bacterial
species in a gram of boreal forest soil was estimated to approximate
10,000. Recently, this number was reevaluated and estimations are
that the number of bacterial types per gram of soil varies between
2000 in polluted soil and 8.3 million in pristine soil (Gans et al.,
2005; Schloss and Handelsman, 2006). Microorganisms dominate
soil communities and have a profound impact on ecosystem func-
tioning, being drivers of key processes in the cycling of energy and
nutrients. The environment in which these microorganisms dwell
is, however, never constant. Abiotic and biotic conditions often
change with time, leading to ﬂuctuations in the soil microbial
communities and in the overall functioning of the soil ecosystem.
The natural variation of soil processes over time, in response to
ﬂuctuations in ecological factors can be depicted as the highs and
lows in soil process rates. These high and lows comprise the upper
and lower borders of what has been coined the normal operating

range (NOR). The NOR thus represents the amplitude of varia-
tion of a given process/parameter under natural (ﬁeld) conditions,
over time. The manner in which the NOR is deﬁned will depend
on the spatial and temporal scales at which measurements are
taken. For instance, the accumulation of organic matter (OM)
in a forest is a slow process. Thus, in order to capture the nat-
ural amplitude of variation in OM in forest soils, measurement
should be taken over a large timespan, on the order of decades.
Local conditions are also likely to inﬂuence OM deposition, and
therefore, measurements may be taken in similar forests across
a region of interest. For processes that respond fast to changes
caused by weather and/or anthropogenic activities, such as nitri-
ﬁcation, a NOR might be deﬁned on the basis of a shorter (one
to a few year) study. Thus, due to its sensitivity to external dri-
vers, processes like nitriﬁcation are considered to represent good
indicators of soil quality (Doran and Zeiss, 2000; Bruinsma et al.,
2003).

The NOR of soil functioning is of key relevance when evalu-
ating the impact of disturbances on soil-borne ecosystem services

and processes. Examples of such potential soil perturbations are
extreme abiotic events (drought, ﬂooding, ﬁre), changes in agricul-
tural management or land use, and/or the planting of genetically
modiﬁed (GM) crops. Deﬁning a NOR is important, as it provides
a background against which to compare the extent of the effects
of such, and other, disturbances (van Straalen, 2002; Bruinsma
et al., 2003; Kowalchuk et al., 2003). For instance, by determining
the ﬂuctuations in the bacterial diversity associated with a suite
of potato plants, Inceoglu et al. (2011) showed that the physio-
logical changes associated with a GM potato did not affect the
bacterial community in its rhizosphere differently from the effects
of ﬁve other cultivars. Moreover, by incorporating perturbance-
sensitive processes (and their proxies) into a mathematical model,
an overall NOR of soil may be determined, which may be of use
as a parameter that indicates the overall soil quality (Pereira e
Silva et al., submitted). This overall NOR will represent a statisti-
cal tool that provides a score for soil functioning. Once the NOR
is deﬁned, it can be used to detect statistically signiﬁcant changes
in soil functioning, in response to disturbances at a speciﬁc time
point.

Agricultural systems annually receive approximately 25% of
global nitrogen input, mostly in the form of ammonium (Gru-
ber and Galloway, 2008). The added ammonium can be oxidized
to nitrate in a two-step process called nitriﬁcation. Besides its
ecological relevance, nitriﬁcation is considered to represent a
perturbation-sensitive process, and as such it has been advocated
as a potentially suitable indicator of soil quality, e.g., in the risk
assessment of GM plants (Bruinsma et al., 2003; Kowalchuk et al.,
2003; Ritz et al., 2009; Wessén and Hallin, 2011). The oxidation
of ammonia, the ﬁrst (and rate-limiting) step in the nitriﬁca-
tion process (performed by ammonia monooxygenase, which is
encoded by amo genes), until recently was considered to be largely
performed by just two monophyletic groups within the gamma-
and beta-proteobacteria (AOB). AOB have been frequently used
as indicators of perturbations, to measure the effects of pollution
in ﬁsh farm sediments (McCaig et al., 1999), contamination of soil
with toxic metals (Stephen et al., 1999), effect of efﬂuent irriga-
tion (Oved et al., 2001) and organic waste residues (Horz et al.,
2004; Nyberg et al., 2006). However, ammonia oxidizing archaea
belonging to the recently described thaumarchaea (AOA; Spang
et al., 2010) have been identiﬁed several years ago (Schleper et al.,
2005; Treusch et al., 2005) and these organisms were found to
respond to environmental factors (Ying et al., 2010). They often
revealed a remarkable numerical dominance in soils (Leininger
et al., 2006).

Both AOA and AOB play roles in nitriﬁcation, although the
exact contribution of each one of the two communities to the
process remains unclear. There is evidence that ammonia oxida-
tion by archaea may exceed that performed by bacteria in some
soils (Prosser and Nicol, 2008; Tourna et al., 2008; Offre et al.,
2009). In contrast, Jia and Conrad (2009) found that, after ammo-
nium addition, the changes in nitriﬁcation activity were paralleled
by changes in the abundances of AOB but not of AOA. Thus, the
likely involvement of the AOA in the process (Caffrey et al., 2007;
Zhang et al., 2009; Wessén et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2011) suggested
that AOA, in conjunction with AOB, should be used as proxies to
monitor nitriﬁcation. Accordingly, both AOA and AOB have been

recently suggested as good indicators of soil quality (Wessén and
Hallin, 2011).

Considering the great importance of nitriﬁcation and the use-
fulness of nitriﬁers as bioindicators of soil quality, the aim of this
work was to determine the NOR of nitriﬁcation across agricultural
soils. For that purpose, we assessed nitriﬁcation across eight soils
over 2 years. The NOR that was thus obtained represents a descrip-
tive measure which illustrates the amplitude of variation of nitri-
ﬁcation and/or its proxies under prevailing conditions in the soils,
over eight locations and time. In particular, we determined the
size, structure and diversity of both AOA and AOB communities
across the soils. Community sizes were studied by quantifying the
archaeal and bacterial amoA genes, whereas community structures
were determined by PCR-DGGE of archaeal amoA and (betapro-
teo) bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Moreover, we constructed bacterial
and archaeal amoA clone libraries to identify the dominant types.
Finally, we also measured relevant chemical soil parameters. We
hypothesized that the ammonia oxidizing communities would be
mainly driven by soil type and pH, suggesting that a NOR should
be deﬁned per soil (textural) type.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
EXPERIMENTAL SITES AND SOIL SAMPLING
Eight soils from different sites in the Netherlands were sampled
seven times between April 2009 and October 2010, after seedling
(April 2009 and 2010), before ﬂowering (June 2009 and 2010),
and in senescence stage (September 2009 and October 2010). In
November 2009 there were no plants in the ﬁelds anymore. The
ﬁelds are used for potato cropping and were under agricultural
rotation regime. Information on land use and location is avail-
able (Table 1). The soils were chosen to represent different soil
types (clay versus sand) and present different chemical proper-
ties (Table A1 in Appendix). Bulk soil samples (4 replicates per
soil; 0.5 kg per replicate) were collected in plastic bags and thor-
oughly homogenized before further processing in the lab. A 100-g
subsample was used for measuring ammonia oxidizing enzyme
activity, molecular biology and soil chemical properties.

SOIL CHEMICAL ANALYSIS AND AMMONIA OXIDIZING ACTIVITY
Soil pH was deﬁned in 0.01 M CaCl2 (1:4.5). Water content was
determined by drying for 48 h at 65˚C. OM content was calcu-
lated on dried soil as the difference between the initial and ﬁnal

and ammonium (N - NH

nicon Instrument Corporation, Tarrytown, New York; samples
from 2009) and using the commercial kits Nanocolor Nitrat50

weight; Macherey-Nagel, Germany; samples from 2010) accord-
ing to Töwe et al. (2010). Potential nitrifying enzyme activity
(NEA) was measured in soil suspensions in the presence of
non-limiting ammonium and ambient atmospheric O2 concen-
tration according to Dassonville et al. (2011), using a modi-
ﬁed version of the method of Hart et al. (1994) with an ionic
chromatography (DX120, Dionex, Salt Lake City, USA) equipped
with a 4-mm× 250-mm column (IonPac AS9 HC).

NUCLEIC ACID EXTRACTION
DNA was extracted from 0.5 g of soil using Power Soil MoBio
kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc., NY, USA), according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions, after the addition of glass beads (diameter
0.1 mm; 0.25 g) to the soil slurries. The cells were disrupted by bead
beating (mini-bead beater; BioSpec Products, United States) three
times for 60 s. The quantity of extracted DNA was estimated by
comparison to a 1-kb DNA ladder (Promega, Leiden, Netherlands)
and quality was determined based on the degree of DNA shearing
(average molecular size) as well as the amounts of co-extracted
compounds.

REAL TIME QUANTITATIVE PCR
The abundance of archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidizers was
quantiﬁed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the amoA gene.
For AOA primers amo23F (Tourna et al., 2008) and crenamo616r
(Nicol et al., 2008) were used obtaining fragments of 624 bp.
AOB amoA quantiﬁcation was performed using primers amoA-
1F (Stephen et al., 1999) and amoA-2R (Rotthauwe et al., 1997),
according to Nicol et al. (2008), generating fragments of 491 bp.
Cycling programs and primer sequences are detailed in Table A2
(in Appendix). Quantiﬁcation was carried out twice from each
of the four soil replicates on the ABI Prism 7300 Cycler (Applied
Biosystems, Germany). The speciﬁcity of the ampliﬁcation prod-
ucts was conﬁrmed by melting-curve analysis, and the expected
sizes of the ampliﬁed fragments were checked in a 1.5% agarose
gel stained with ethidium bromide. Standard curves were obtained
using serial dilutions of plasmid containing cloned archaeal or bac-
terial amoA gene, from 107 to 102 gene copy numbers/microliter.
Possible inhibitory effects of co-extracted humid compounds were
checked by spiking standard concentrations with samples. No
apparent inhibition was observed.

STANDARD PCR AMPLIFICATION AND DGGE ANALYSIS
PCR was performed targeting 16S rRNA and amoA genes of
ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) or AOA, respectively. Ampliﬁ-
cation of 16S rRNA gene fragments from extracted soil DNA was
achieved by primary ampliﬁcation with CTO189f and CTO654r
primers (Kowalchuk et al., 1997) and with a secondary nested
ampliﬁcation using bacterial 357f-GC and 518r primers (Muyzer
et al., 1993). CTO and bacterial primers ampliﬁed 465 and
161 bp fragments, respectively. A detailed procotol is described in
Freitag et al. (2006). AOA amoA was ampliﬁed using primers
crenamA23f/crenamoA616r (Tourna et al., 2008). Cycling con-
ditions are described in Table A2 (in Appendix). DGGE proﬁles

were generated with the Ingeny Phor-U system (Ingeny Interna-
tional, Goes, The Netherlands). The PCR products (120 ng/lane)
were loaded onto 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, with a 15–55 and
35–70% denaturant gradient (100% denaturant corresponded to
7 M urea and 40% (v/v) deionized formamide) for archaeal amoA
and 16S rRNA gene, respectively, as described previously by Nicol
et al. (2008). Electrophoresis was performed at a constant volt-
age of 100 V for 16 h at 60˚C. The gels were stained for 60 min in
0.5× TAE buffer with SYBR Gold (ﬁnal concentration 0.5 μg/l;
Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands). Images of the gels were
obtained with Imagemaster VDS (Amersham Biosciences, Buck-
inghamshire, United Kingdom) and normalized in the GelCompar
II software (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens Latem, Belgium), using
the unweighted-pair group method with arithmetic mean, rolling-
disk background subtraction, and no optimization (Kropf, 2004;
Rademaker and de Bruijn, 2004). Patterns were compared by
clustering the different lanes by Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient
implemented in GelCompar.

CONSTRUCTION OF AOA AND AOB LIBRARIES AND PHYLOGENETIC
ANALYSIS
Clones libraries of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes for the
eight soils were constructed using DNA extracted from soil col-
lected in June of 2010. Primers Crenam23f/Crenamo616r for
archaeal amoA, and primers amoA-1R/amoA-2R for bacterial
amoA were used, as described for real time PCR. The products
from replicates were pooled per soil, ligated into PGEM-T-Easy
vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA, EUA) in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions and white colonies were subject
to a colony PCR with vector speciﬁc primers M13-F and M13-R
to check for the presence of amoA inserts. DNA sequencing was
performed using an Applied Biosystems 3730 XL DNA Analyzer
at LGC Genomics GmbH (Berlin, Germany). Short sequences or
sequences of chimeric origin were checked by analyzing align-
ments using Bellerophon (Huber et al., 2004) and excluded from
the analysis. Sequences obtained were processed in Mega (version
5, Mega, Biodesign Institute), translated, and the deduced amino
acid sequences were aligned using Clustal W (Jeanmougin, 1998).
Sequences at 1% cut-off were used to construct phylogenetic trees
in which representative sequences from GenBank were included.
Distance analysis of derived archaeal and bacterial amoA protein
sequences and bootstrap support (neighbor-joining and parsi-
mony analysis; 1000 replicates each) were constructed in Mega,
using Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution model with site

variation (invariable sites and eight variable gamma rates; Olsen
et al., 1994). Differences in the community structures of AOA and
AOB clone libraries were analyzed with UniFrac (Lozupone et al.,
2006), and the program DOTUR (Distance-based OTU and rich-
ness; Schloss and Handelsman, 2006) was used to create rarefaction
curves and to determine the Shannon diversity index.

DATA ANALYSIS
Physico-chemical variables were checked for normality and were
log-transformed, except for soil pH. Differences in these variables
between sandy and clay soils, among all eight soils, and over time
were assessed with Student’s t -tests.

To test the inﬂuence of soil physico-chemical parameters (envi-
ronmental factors) on community structure, forward selection was
used on CCA, to select a combination of environmental vari-
ables that explained most of the variation observed in the AOA
and AOB species matrix. For that, a series of constrained CCA
permutations was performed in Canoco (version 4.0 for Win-
dows, PRI Wageningen, The Netherlands,) to determine which
variables best explained the assemblage variation, using automatic
forward selection and Monte Carlo permutations tests (permu-
tations= 999). The length of the corresponding arrows indicated
the relative importance of the chemical factor explaining variation
in the two microbial communities.

To study the dynamics of AOA and AOB communities over
time, a matrix of similarities based on Pearson’s correlation was
used to perform moving window analysis – MWA (Marzorati et al.,
2008), by calculating the rate of change in community struc-
ture, as dissimilarity= 100− similarity % (represented by Δt ).
The rate of change parameter (Δt ) averages the degree of change
between consecutive DGGE proﬁles of the same community over
a ﬁxed time interval (Marzorati et al., 2008), giving an indication
of community turnover for that time period.

Correlations between NEA and community structure were
tested using the RELATE analysis, a non-parametric form of Man-
tel test, implemented in PRIMER-E software package (version 6,
PRIMER-E Ltd., Plymouth, UK; Clarke and Gorley, 2006). More
speciﬁcally, for each functional group (AOA or AOB), a rank
correlation coefﬁcient (here Spearman coefﬁcient) and signiﬁ-
cance level (obtained by a permutation test using 5000 permu-
tations) were computed to quantify the correlation between the
rank similarity matrices obtained for activity and genetic struc-
ture (Clarke and Ainsworth, 1993). For each functional group,
ANOSIM statistics (Primer-E software) was performed to test for
an effect of soil type on AOA and AOB community structure.

The NOR of NEA and the abundance of ammonia oxidizers
were determined by subtracting lower values from higher values
(also represented by Δt ) of activity or amoA gene copy num-
bers, respectively. The inﬂuence of soil parameters or abundance
of ammonia oxidizers on NEA was determined by using Pearson’s
linear correlation coefﬁcient implemented in SPSS 16.0 (SPSS,
Inc., IL, USA).

We also conducted multiple regression analyses on log-
normalized data (SAS® system for Windows version 8.02, SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA, 2001) to identify the main drivers of
nitriﬁcation. The following parameters were included in the analy-
sis: diversity (Shannon diversity index H
based on DGGE proﬁles)

(cid:2)

and abundance (A) of archaeal (AOA) and bacterial (AOB) ammo-
nia oxidizers, potential NEA, nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4),
pH, OM in %, clay content in % (clay) and soil moisture in %
(humidity).

DATA ACCESSIBILITY
The amoA sequences for the AOA and AOB have been deposited in
the GenBank under accession number JF935450 – JF936076 and
JF936077 – JF936667 for AOA and AOB, respectively.

RESULTS
SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF SOIL CHEMICAL PROPERTIES
Soil pH, nitrate, ammonium and OM levels and water content
were determined in triplicate across all soil samples. Overall,
considering all soils, soil pH was signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.05)
in soils K, G and L (7.32± 0.06, n = 57) than in soils B, V,
D, W, and S (4.88± 0.04, n = 99) during the whole experimen-
tal period and no signiﬁcant variation over time was observed.
Signiﬁcant changes were observed in levels of nitrate at all
times, with lower values in the end of the season (September

ﬂuctuations (P < 0.05) in water contents in the soils were detected
at all times in 2009, but not 2010. The most humid sampling time
was November (23.64± 2.15%), and the driest was September
(12.25± 1.68%). Variations in OM content were observed from
September (5.63± 1.20%) to November (7.34± 1.45%) 2009, and
from April (6.28± 0.85%) to June (5.04± 0.89%) 2010. Individ-
ual values for each soil at each sampling time can be found in
Table A1 (in Appendix). Concerning differences between sandy
and clayey soils, soil pH was signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.05) in the
clayey (6.9± 0.17, n = 78) than in the sandy soils (4.71± 0.06,
n = 78). Levels of ammonium and nitrate were signiﬁcantly

Pearson’s correlation analysis between NEA and soil physico-
chemical parameters over time revealed that the enzyme activities
correlated positively only with soil pH (r = 0.70, P ≤ 0.05; Table 2),
but a small yet signiﬁcant effect of clay content was also identiﬁed
by multiple regression analysis (Table 3). When the same analysis
was repeated for sandy and clayey soils separately, we observed
that nitrate and OM were also important explanatory variables
(Table 3).

SEASONAL VARIATION IN THE ABUNDANCE OF AOA AND AOB
COMMUNITIES IN RELATION TO SOIL PARAMETERS
Considering all eight soils, both the AOA and AOB abundances
varied within 1–2 orders of magnitude across the sampling times.
The numbers of archaeal amoA genes were in the range of
5.94× 105–2.53× 107 gene copies per gram of dry soil, whereas
the bacterial amoA gene numbers varied between 2.95× 105 and
8.32× 107 gene copies per gram of dry soil. The AOA abun-
dance was signiﬁcantly higher in June 2010 and lower in April
2009 (P < 0.05), whereas the AOB abundance was the highest in
October 2010, with comparable numbers at the other sampling
times (Figures 2A–C). In general, AOA and AOB population sizes
tended to increase from April to June in both years, decreasing

sandy soils (Δt clay = 1.45± 0.3 and Δt sandy = 1.26± 0.08), than
for AOA (Δt AOA = 1.21± 0.08) abundances, which was higher in
the clayey soils (Δt clay = 1.25± 0.02 and Δt sandy = 1.18± 0.02;

especially in the clayey soils (Figures 2B,C).

Pearson’s correlations between the archaeal and bacterial amoA
gene copy numbers and the soil chemical parameters measured
revealed that only soil pH signiﬁcantly affected the abundance
of AOA (r = 0.73, P ≤ 0.05), but showed no inﬂuence on the
abundance of AOB (Table 2).

ANALYSIS OF AOA AND AOB COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND
DIVERSITY IN RELATION TO SOIL PARAMETERS
Two-way analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) showed an overall
effect of soil type on AOA and AOB community structures at

all times, but to a lesser extent on AOB (Table A3 in Appen-
dix). Based on R values, the greatest community differentiations
became measurable during early fall for AOA, but during spring
and summer for AOB. The dynamics of the AOA and AOB commu-
nities were addressed by moving window analysis (MWA), whose
concept can be interpreted as the number of species that on aver-
age come to signiﬁcant dominance at a given habitat, during a
deﬁned time interval. Our results showed that AOA and AOB had
different patterns of variation. On average, the variability of AOB

was higher than that of AOA populations (Δt AOB = 62.76± 2.10%
and Δt AOA = 53.65± 3.37%; Figure 3A). Whereas for AOA higher
variations were detected in the sandy soils (Δt sandy = 60.27±
2.97%) compared to the clayey ones (Δt clayey = 41.09± 3.92%;
higher in the clayey soils (Δt clayey = 66.55± 1.18%) compared to
the sandy ones (Δt sandy = 58.98± 3.01%; Figure 3C).

Canonical correspondence analysis was used to investigate pos-
sible trends in the temporal changes in the community structures
of AOA and AOB, and to test the signiﬁcance of the inﬂuence of
soil parameters on those changes. Although seasonality seemed
to play a role in the distribution of both communities, no clear
trend could be observed. In general, communities at the start of
the growth season tended to cluster together (Figures A1 and A2
in Appendix). This was true especially for the AOB, in both sandy

and clayey soils. The community structures of the AOA seemed to
be more variable across the sampling times. Moreover, all soil vari-
ables measured apparently exerted signiﬁcant effects on the AOA
and AOB community structures. In order to determine the relative
contribution of each soil parameter, we used variance partitioning
to control for the effect of each individual parameter, when all
others are deﬁned as covariables in the constrained analyses (Leps

and Smilauer, 2003). Considering the whole data set, soil parame-
ters explained 33.4 and 49% of the variability in AOA and AOB
community structures, respectively. In both cases, the percentage
of clay, OM and soil pH were the most important parameters,
explaining 18% (AOA) and 5.9% (AOB) of these variation.

Separating the soil in two groups, i.e., sandy and clayey ones,
led to an increase in the overall percentage of variation explained

for clayey and sandy soils, respectively). In clayey soils, the per-
centage of clay, OM, and soil pH explained 45.5%, whereas for
sandy soils, these three parameters explained 44.9% of the vari-
ation in community structure. Although the separation per soil

type diminished the total percentage of variation explained by
the soil parameters for AOB communities (15.8 and 17.1% for
clayey and sand soil, respectively), it increased the percentage of
variation explained by the percentage of clay, OM and soil pH to
10.7–10.8%.

Dynamics of nitriﬁers across soils

To gain larger ﬁne-scale taxonomic resolution of the archaeal
and bacterial communities, we constructed 16 clone libraries based
on the amoA gene, from the eight soils. Phylogenetic analyses
of the archaeal amoA fragments revealed that all clones were
related to sequences of uncultured crenarchaeota obtained in ear-
lier environmental studies. All sequences were found to cluster
in a few groups denoted soil/sediment, sediment/soil and, to a
lesser percentage, marine lineages (Figure 4A), with some site-
dependent variability. Sequences from sandy soil sites were dis-
persed among sequences from soil/sediment, sediment/soil and
marine clusters, whereas sequences from the clayey sites were
mainly related to the soil/sediment and marine clusters (Figure A3
in Appendix). The soil type effect detected by multivariate analyses

on DGGE data was also observed for clone libraries, as deter-
mined by UniFrac analysis of the archaeal amoA sequences
(Figure 5A).

Regarding the analysis of bacterial amoA gene fragments,
almost all bacterial clone sequences represented amoA-like
sequences that grouped with Nitrosospira clusters, one grouping
with Nitrosomonas, although some of them showed no similar-
ity with any known cluster (Figure A4 in Appendix). Most of
the bacterial sequences were found spread over eight clusters
and a high site-dependent variability was observed (Figure 4B).
For instance, Nitrosospira cluster 3b was predominant in soils
K and L, whereas cluster 11/12 comprised 40 and 90% of
the sequences in soils B and V, respectively. We further found

DISCUSSION
TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATION IN POTENTIAL NITRIFICATION
RATES IN RELATION TO CHEMICAL PARAMETERS
In general, the rates of potential nitriﬁcation in soil have been
found to vary greatly, whether in an agricultural ﬁeld, natural
grassland or a forest soil, with observed amplitudes of variation
−1 have been
being soil-dependent. Rates of 40–132 μg NO

niﬁcantly over time, although the values were much lower than the
−1. This variation
abovementioned ones, from 0.59 to 0.79 μgN h
could be mainly attributed to two soil parameters, soil pH and soil
texture. Interestingly, positive correlations between pH and NEA
were consistently found, which might be explained by the fact that
at lower pH values an increasingly higher number of ammonia
oxidizers is inhibited (Webster et al., 2002).

that the sequences tended to cluster according to soil type,
being Nitrosospira clusters 1 and 2 mainly represented in the
sandy soils and Nitrosospira cluster 0 mostly in the clayey soils.
This was also conﬁrmed by UniFrac analysis of the sequences
(Figure 5B).

This indicates that patterns of NEA become even more complex
when including the perspective of time. Nevertheless, such overall
process parameters are important, as they constitute the “nor-
mal” amplitude of variation found across soil systems. Regarding
the inﬂuence of soil parameters, several soil factors are known to
inﬂuence the potential nitriﬁcation rates. For instance, the rates
of potential nitriﬁcation were found to increase with decreasing
salinity (Caffrey et al., 2007) and with increasing temperature up
to 30˚C (Tourna et al., 2008). The rates are known to be sig-
niﬁcantly reduced in acid soils (de Boer and Kowalchuk, 2001),
although only a slightly signiﬁcant negative relationship between
nitriﬁcation and pH was observed in organic soils (Booth et al.,
2005).

SEASONAL VARIATION OF NEA IN RELATION TO BIOLOGICAL
PARAMETERS
Nitrifying enzyme activity was positively correlated with the abun-
dance of AOA (r = 0.74, P ≤ 0.05), but not with that of AOB
(Table 2). Changes in nitriﬁcation rates were also signiﬁcantly
correlated with changes in the community structures of the
AOA and AOB, which were observed to vary with season and
soil type (Table 4; Table A3 in Appendix). The analyses over
time revealed high correlation values between NEA and AOA
community structures at all times (except June 2010). These
were season dependent, as correlations with the AOA commu-
nities were higher at the end of the season (September and
November) and lower at the start (April and June). Correlations
between activity and AOB community were higher at the start
(June 2010) and lower at the end (September 2009 and October
2010).

Overall, NEA was affect mainly by the abundance and diver-
sity (Shannon index from DGGE proﬁles) of AOA, which together
explained 17% of the variation in nitrifying activities (Table 3).
The results observed were similar for the sandy soils; however in
the clayey soils only diversity, but not abundance, of AOB seemed
to play a signiﬁcant – although small – role (Table 3).

ABUNDANCE AND STRUCTURE OF AMMONIA OXIDIZING
COMMUNITIES AS AFFECTED BY SOIL CHEMICAL PARAMETERS
It is important to understand how the nitriﬁcation process is
impacted by soil conditions, and also how and to what extent the
structure, composition and abundance of the ammonia oxidizing
communities are affected, as the latter may coincide with altered
rates. The population sizes of the AOA and AOB across soils and
times were found to be within the range observed in other soil
systems (Shen et al., 2008; Hallin et al., 2009; Wessén et al., 2011).
However, the AOA/AOB ratio’s observed in our study were lower
than those previously reported (Leininger et al., 2006). In recent
work, levels of 106–107 amoA gene copy numbers per g dry soil have
been observed for the AOA and AOB in agricultural soils (Gubry-
Rangin et al., 2010; Wessén et al., 2011), although AOA numbers
of up to 108 and AOB numbers of 107 have been observed in dif-
ferent agricultural soils (Leininger et al., 2006). Moreover, amoA
gene numbers as low as 104 have been found for AOB in ﬂooded
paddy soils (Chen et al., 2010) and non-fertilized agricultural soil
(Leininger et al., 2006). We found signiﬁcant seasonal variation
in the abundances of AOA and AOB. Temporal variations in the
abundances of AOB and AOB were also observed in a 2-year study
of the inﬂuence of different soil management techniques (Le Roux

et al., 2008). Moreover, such variations were already hypothesized
to occur in grassland and cropping systems (Berg and Rosswall,
1987).

Several soil factors, such as water content, seasonality and fertil-
izer type, are thought to affect the population sizes and community
structures of ammonia oxidizers in soil (Nugroho et al., 2006;
Schmidt et al., 2007; Hansel et al., 2008). In this study, a highly
positive correlation of soil pH with the abundance of AOA, but
not with the abundance of AOB, was observed. Although soil pH
is known to drive changes in the AOA and AOB communities
(Nicol et al., 2008; Erguder et al., 2009), its effects are still contro-
versial, as decreases in AOA abundances have been observed both
with decreasing (Hallin et al., 2009), and increasing soil pH (Nicol

et al., 2008). Other factors, such as soil moisture and nitrogen
availability, are also known to inﬂuence the ammonia oxidizing
communities (He et al., 2007; Hallin et al., 2009). It has previ-
ously been shown that AOA are more abundant in soils with lower
levels of available nitrogen, whereas AOB become more abundant
in soils under higher levels (Jia and Conrad, 2009). However, in
the current study, none of these factors (moisture and N availabil-
ity) determined the AOA/AOB community sizes. This may indicate
either that the abundances are not affected by these drivers or, most
probably, that the drivers are not the same across soils. Several pre-
vious studies proposed soil type to be the primary determinant of
the bacterial composition in arable soils (Gelsomino et al., 1999;
Girvan et al., 2003), but only few studies have addressed the effect

of soil type on AOA and AOB abundance. Wessén et al. (2011)
found that the abundance of AOA was negatively affected by clay
content, which could be indicative of the AOA being less abun-
dant in the supposedly nutrient-rich environments. However, in
our study we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant correlations between AOA
abundance and clay content.

The community structure analyses by MWA indicated higher
changes for the AOB, whereas the observed changes were lower
for AOA. MWA describes the stability and species turnover over
time; hence, a 65% change in AOB community structure between
April and June means that from April to June the AOB community
was very dynamic. In fact, the two communities shared only 35%
of phylotypes and 65% changed over this time period. The AOA
community was less dynamic than AOB over this time period, as
shown by the lower percentage of change. Multivariate analysis
revealed that the variables that contributed the most to changes in
the system were soil clay content, OM, and pH. In fact, taking the
differences in soil texture into account, we increased the resolv-
ing power of the method, allowing the detection of signiﬁcant
differences in the pattern.

An effect of soil texture on the phylogenetic make-up of the
AOA was also observed, as sequences from the sandy soils formed
a cluster that was separate from those from the clayey ones (sup-
ported by UniFrac). Analyses of the bacterial amoA genes showed a
dominance of Nitrosospira clusters 3a.1 and 3b, which was mainly
due to their dominance in the clayey soils. Conversely, in the
sandy soils, Nitrosospira clusters 1 and 2 were dominant. This is
consistent with ﬁndings by Stephen et al. (1996), who detected
a dominance of Nitrosospira cluster 3 in pH-neutral agricultural
soils versus Nitrosospira cluster 2 in more acidic soils; this followed
a classiﬁcation of AOB clusters deﬁned in other studies (Avrahami
and Conrad, 2003).

EXPLORING THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF AMMONIA
OXIDIZING COMMUNITIES ON NITRIFICATION RATES
Strong correlations were found between NEA and AOA abun-
dances (Table 2). Moreover, when studying AOA and AOB com-
munity structures, higher correlations of NEA were found with
AOA than with AOB at all times (Table A3 in Appendix). In con-
trast, Morimoto et al. (2011) found that nitriﬁcation rates in a
low-humic Andosol soil correlated more with the abundance of
AOB, suggesting that the relative importance of AOA or AOB to
nitriﬁcation is site-dependent. The composition of the AOA and
AOB communities, and their potential niches, also play roles in
soil nitriﬁcation rates. Phylogenetic analyses of archaeal amoA
genes showed that the sequences retrieved were quite similar to
sequences found in previous studies (Figures A3 and A4 in Appen-
dix). Moreover, the diversity was low, as indicated from rarefaction
analysis. Although no study has been able to clearly link the rate of
nitriﬁcation with the presence of distinct AOA or AOB groups, it
was recently reported that higher nitriﬁcation rates were observed
in sediments dominated by phylogenetically more diverse archaeal
amoA sequences (Wankel et al., 2010). This goes against our ﬁnd-
ings, which revealed that higher nitriﬁcation rates occurred in
less diverse soil assemblages, indicating that just a few dominant
types maybe be responsible for the nitriﬁcation process in these
soils.

ESTABLISHING THE NOR OF NITRIFICATION IN AGRICULTURAL SOILS
In the past decades, a lot of attention has been given to the effect
of external disturbances on soil microbial communities (Men-
dum, 2002; Wertz et al., 2007; Bardgett et al., 2008; Drenovsky
et al., 2010; Pereira e Silva et al., 2011). For instance, the effects
of alien plant species or GM plants on the sizes, structures and
compositions of microbial communities (Inceoglu et al., 2011)
have been addressed. This applies also to the introduction of new
plant cultivars (GM or non GM), and any concomitant changes
in agricultural practices, such as mechanization, different plow-
ing regimen, planting times and pest controls, which might cause
disturbances in soil microbial processes. An elegant approach to
determine the effects of such factors on ﬁeld soil is to evaluate
whether their strength is enough to affect processes in such a way
that these fall outside of what would be considered normal. In
order to do so, we need to know the NOR of the process under“nor-
mal” or natural conditions. In the context of our work, we propose
the deﬁnition of a NOR for agricultural soil by determining the
highs and lows in selected processes relevant for ecosystem func-
tioning. Thus, a range of soil attributes or properties (indicators)
are selected, which are representative of a process that is sensi-
tive to external drivers and easily measured and whose changes
can be monitored through time, as previously suggested (Bru-
insma et al., 2003; Kowalchuk et al., 2003). Second, it is crucial
to take measurements from long-term datasets, possibly across
several sites, to enable the capturing of environmental ﬂuctua-
tions that are independent of spatial and temporal scales. Third,
only after implementing the appropriate NOR in a model can the
concept of an overall soil NOR be fully operational.

We considered the oxidation of ammonia as such a sensitive
process, and established the natural ﬂuctuations by analyzing com-
munity structure, abundance and activity of ammonia oxidizers
in eight soils over 2 year. We took into account seasonal inﬂuences,
management practices, addition of fertilizers and crop rotation,
representing the “normal” conditions. We observed that the dri-
vers of the changes in structure, abundance and activity were
mainly clay content and soil pH, although other soil parameters
were also found to affect the structures of these communities, e.g.,
nitrate and ammonium. All analyses performed indicated a strong
effect of soil type, roughly deﬁned in sandy and clayey. Although
this division is somewhat loose, and other factors such as pH co-
vary with soil type, it enabled us to detect signiﬁcant differences
in the NOR. The relevance of soil type has also been found in
studies focusing on macroorganisms, in which gene expression of
the soil-dwelling collembolan Folsomia candida was differentially
regulated in clayey versus sandy soil (de Boer et al., 2011). These
results suggest that differences in chemical composition observed
between sandy and clay soils are of great relevance when studying
soil organisms in general, suggesting that a soil type-dependent
NOR should be envisaged. One can argue that the timeframe used
in our study is relatively short for deﬁnitive conclusions. However,
the soils used in this study are subjected to the same agricultural
practice for many years already, and thus a 2-year study was con-
sidered a sufﬁciently sound ﬁrst step allowing the deﬁnition of
the variation that might be considered normal for these sites.
Moreover, from the data we may already glean a basis for a possible
NOR.

Dynamics of nitriﬁers across soils

Overall, the NOR of potential nitriﬁcation was also different
between sandy and clayey soils, being lower and less variable over
time in the sandy than in the clayey soils. Moreover, the bio-
logical and chemical parameters measured were better able to
predict nitriﬁcation rates in sandy soils. Both ammonia oxidiz-
ing communities were sensitive to the parameters associated with
soil type, and ﬂuctuated differently among each other, as well as
within soils with contrasting texture and pH. MWA showed the
AOB communities to ﬂuctuate more, indicating a more dynamic
community with higher species turnover than AOA. Furthermore,
the diversity of both communities differed greatly between sandy
and clayey soils. This soil type-speciﬁc response indicated that
different aspects of the bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidiz-
ers should be taken into account when evaluating the effect of
external disturbances on nitriﬁcation. Understanding the nor-
mal ﬂuctuations of these soil communities and determining how
environmental variations structure them will allow the provi-
sion of a key monitoring tool (Magurran et al., 2010). In this
context, the NOR of soil functioning will allow us to deﬁne nor-
mality and to grasp the mechanisms responsible for variation,
enabling us to describe the impact of perturbations on the process
measured.

CONCLUSION
To be able to assess the impact of disturbances on soil micro-
bial community structure and function, it is imperative to obtain

complete knowledge of the “normal” sources of variation, the
extent to which they inﬂuence soil microorganisms and the pos-
sible outcomes of this interaction. Accordingly, the collection of a
large data set, like the current one, should be encouraged for both
natural ecosystems and agricultural areas. These types of data will
be of key relevance when evaluating the impact of GM plants or
global change on soil ecosystem services. We propose here that,
to establish the NOR of nitriﬁcation in agricultural soils, both the
AOA and AOB abundances and community structures should be
considered in addition to the nitrifying activities. The conspic-
uous differences regarding soil type dictate the establishment of
NORs per soil type. However, ﬁeld studies comparable to the cur-
rent one, performed across time, remain necessary to evaluate the
extent and direction of the variations that underpin the NOR of
nitriﬁcation.
