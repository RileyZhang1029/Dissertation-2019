Summary: Cross-mapping of gene and protein identifiers between different databases is a tedious and time-consuming task.
To overcome this, we developed CRONOS, a cross-reference server that contains entries from five mammalian organisms presented by major gene and protein information resources.
Sequence similarity analysis of the mapped entries shows that the cross-
