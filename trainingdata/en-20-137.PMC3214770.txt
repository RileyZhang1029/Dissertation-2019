In order to the neuroprotective effect of Lycium chinense fruit (LCF), the present study examined the effects of Lycium chinense 
fruit on learning and memory in Morris water maze task and the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP) of rats with trimethyltin (TMT)-induced neuronal and cognitive impairments. The rats were randomly 
divided into the following groups: naïve rat (Normal), TMT injection+saline administered rat (control) and TMT injection+LCF 
administered rat (LCF). Rats were administered with saline or LCF (100 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for 2 weeks, followed by their training 
to the tasks. In the water maze test, the animals were trained to find a platform in a fixed position during 6d and then received 60s 
probe trial on the 7th day following removal of platform from the pool. Rats with TMT injection showed impaired learning and 
memory of the tasks and treatment with LCF (p<0.01) produced a significant improvement in escape latency to find the platform 
in the Morris water maze at the 2nd day. Consistent with behavioral data, treatment with LCF also slightly reduced the loss of ChAT 
and cAMP in the hippocampus compared to the control group. These results demonstrated that LCF has a protective effect against 
TMT-induced neuronal and cognitive impairments. The present study suggests that LCF might be useful in the treatment of TMT-
induced learning and memory deficit.

useful model of neurodegeneration and selective neuronal death 
(Balaban et al., 1988; Koczyk et al., 1996b; Ishida et al., 1997; 
Brabeck et al., 2002; Geloso et al., 2002, 2004).
In the rat, TMT impairs hippocampally-dependent behaviors, 
including passive avoidance (Walsh et al., 1982a), water maze 
(Hagan et al., 1988; Earley et al., 1992) and working and/or 
reference memory measured in the radial arm maze (Walsh et al., 
1982b; Miller and O’Callaghan, 1984; Bushnell and Angell, 1992; 
Alessandri et al., 1994). Furthermore, behavioral studies have 
shown increased locomotor activity, disruption in self-grooming 
and learning deficits in TMT-intoxicated rats (Swartzwelder 
et al., 1981, 1982; Cohen et al., 1987; Hagan et al., 1988; Segal, 
1988; Cannon et al., 1991, 1994 a, b; Woodruff et al., 1991; Earley 
et al., 1992; Messing et al., 1992; Alessandri et al., 1994). TMT 
intoxication impairs the acquisition of water maze and Biel 
maze (water avoidance) task as well as Hebb-Williams maze and 
radial arm maze performance (Walsh et al., 1982a, b; O’Connell 
et al., 1994a, b, 1996; Ishida et al., 1997). Moreover, TMT has 
been shown to produce effects on operant behavior, since TMT-
intoxicated rats had higher lever pressing rats under a fixed-ratio 
schedule of food presentation (Swartzwelder et al., 1981) and 
TMT impaired the performance of differential reinforcement at 
low response rates in an operant schedule (Woodruff et al., 1991). 
These anatomical and behavioral findings have made TMT-
intoxicated rats an attractive model for degenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia 
(Woodruff et al., 1994).
Herbs have recently become attractive as health-beneficial foods 
(physiologically functional foods) and as a source material for 
the development of drugs. Herbal medicines derived from plant 
extracts are being utilized increasingly to treat a wide variety of 
clinical diseases, with relatively little knowledge regarding their 
modes of action (Matthews et al., 1999). Lycium chinense fruit is 
widely distributed in East Asia and has been used traditionally 
for anti-aging purpose (Xiao et al., 1999). Recently, the neuro-
protective effect of Lycium chinense fruit has been reported by 
Geloso et al. (2002, 2004), but the underlying mechanism of 
protective action is not fully understood. 
The present study was undertaken to evaluate the neuro protec-
ti ve effect of Lycium chinense fruit on TMT-induced learning 
and memory deficits in the rats and to elucidate the mechanism 
underlying these protective effects in rats. Rats were tested on 
Morris water maze for the spatial learning and memory. The 
analyzed parameters included choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) 
and cyclic adenine monophosphate (cAMP) in the hippocampus. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals and experimental design
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighting 250~280 g each were 
purchased from Samtaco Animal Corp. (Kyungki-do, Korea). 
The animals were allowed to acclimatize themselves for at least 
7 days prior to the experimentation. The animals were housed 
in individual cages under light-controlled conditions (12/12-hr 
light/dark cycle) and at 23°C room temperature. Food and water 
were available ad libitum. All experiments were approved by the 
catholic university institutional animal care and use committee. 
They were allowed at least 1week to adapt to their environment 
before the experiments.
The rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with TMT (6.0 
mg/kg, body weight) dissolved in 0.9% saline and then returned 
to their home cages. The rats were randomly divided into the 
following groups (n=8 per group): the naïve rat (Normal), 
TMT injection+Saline administered rat (Control), and TMT 
injection+LCF administered rat (LCF). Drug (400 mg/kg) was 
dissolved in saline and orally administered for two weeks after 
TMT injection. From the 15th after the injection of drug, the water 
maze test was performed for one week.

Morris water maze test
The swimming pool of the Morris water maze was a circular 
water tank 200 cm in diameter and 35 cm deep. It was filled to 
a depth of 21 cm with water at 23±2°C. A platform 15 cm in 
diameter and 20 cm in height was placed inside the tank with its 
top surface being 1.5cm below the surface of the water. The pool 
was surrounded by many cues that were external to the maze 
(D’Hooge and De deyn, 2001). A CCD camera was equipped 
with a personal computer for the behavioral analysis. Each rat 
was received four daily trials. For 6 consecutive days, the rats were 
tested with three acquisition tests. They also received retention 
tests on the 7th day. For the acquisition test, the rat was allowed 
to search for the hidden platform for 180s and the latency to 
escape onto the platform was recorded. The animals were trained 
to find the platform that was in a fixed position during 6 days 
for the acquisition test, and then for the retention test (at the 7th 
day), they received a 1 min probe trial in which the platform was 
removed from the pool. The intertrial interval time was 1 min. 
Performance of the test animals in each water maze trial was 
assessed by a personal computer for the behavioral analysis (S-mart 
program, Spain).

ChAT, cAMP immunohistochemistry
At the end of the behavioral observation, the animals were deeply

anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and then 
perfused transcardially with 100 ml of saline, followed by 500 ml 
of a 4% solution of formaldehyde prepared in phosphate buffer. 
The brains were then removed, postfixed in the same fixative for 
two to three hours at 4°C and then placed overnight at 4°C in PBS 
containing 20% sucrose. On the following day, the brain was cut 
into coronal sections that were sliced to 30 μm-thicknesses. The 
primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the following specific 
antigen were used: Cholinacetyl transferase (ChAT, concentration 
1 : 2,000; Cambridge Research Biochemicals, Wilmington, DE), 
cAMP (concentration 1 : 200; Cambridge Research Biochemicals, 
Wilmington, DE). The primary antibody was prepared at a 
dilution of 2,000x in 0.3% PBST, 2% normal rabbit serum and 
0.001% kehole limpit hemocyanin (Sigma, CA, USA). The sections 
were incubated in the primary antiserum for 72 h at 4°C. After 
three more rinses in PBST, the sections were placed in Vectastain 
Elite ABC reagent (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2 h at 
room temperature. Following a further rinsing in PBS, the tissue 
was developed using diaminobenzadine (Sigma, CA, USA) as 
the chromogen. Images were captured using an Axio Vision 3.0

imaging systems (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and processed 
in Adobe Photoshop. For measuring cells of ChAT, the grid was 
placed on CA1 and CA3 in the hippocampus areas according 
to the method of Paxinos et al. (1985). The number of cells was 
counted at 100x magnification using a microscope rectangle grid 
measuring 200×200 μm.

Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons were done for the behavioral and 
histochemical studies using the one-way ANOVA, repeated 
measure of ANOVA, respectively and Tukey post hoc was 
done. All of the results were presented as means±S.E.M., and we 
used SPSS 15.0 for Windows for analysis of the statistics. The 
significance level was set at p<0.05.

RESULTS

Effect of LCF on performance in water maze task
Fig. 1A shows mean group latencies to reach to hidden 
platform in the Morris water maze for all groups for 6 days. 
The escape latency differed among the groups when the results 
were averaged over all the session. The control group showed a 
worse performance than did the normal group (at the Day 1, 2, 
respectively). There were no significant main effects, but there was 
a slight trend for a significant interaction effect on the distance 
traveled to reach the platform.
To examine the spatial memory of rats, the time spent swimming 
to the platform was compared and analysis is illustrated in Fig. 
1B. The times spent to the platform were significantly different 
among the groups [F2,24=7.6, p<0.05]; the normal group spent 
more time around the platform than the control group (p<0.05 for 
the normal group). However, treatment of LCF was significantly

ChAT immunoreactive neurons of the hippocampus
The results of determining the ChAT immunoreative cells per 
section from different hippocampal formations are shown in Fig. 
2. The number of ChAT neurons in the CA1 area was 19.8±4.6 in 
the normal group, 16.5.7±0.3 in the control group and 18.5±1.9 in 
the LCF group [F2,11=0.678]. Also, the ChAT immunoreactive 
cells in the CA3 area were 16.5±2.6 in the normal group, 16.5±1.6 
in the control group and 17.5±1.6 in the LCF group [F2,11=0.907]. 
The number of ChAT positive neurons in the hippocampal CA1 
was slightly increased in the LCF group compared to the control 
group. However, there were no statistically significant differences.

cAMP immunoreactive neurons of the hippocampus
The results of determining the cAMP immunoreative cells per 
section from different hippocampal formations are shown in Fig. 
3. The number of cAMP neurons in the CA1 area was 18.5±1.3 in 
the normal group, 18.0±1.8 in the control group and 21.0±1.95 in 
the LCF group [F2,11=0.446]. Also, the cAMP immunoreactive 
cells in the CA3 area were 20.5±1.7 in the normal group, 20±1.3 in 
the control group and 24.3±1.0 in the LCF group [F2,11=0.103]. 
The number of cAMP positive neurons was control group and 
24.3±1.0 in the LCF group [F2,11=0.103]. The number of cAMP 
positive neurons was increased to 121.2% of the control in the 
LCF group (p<0.05). The number of cAMP positive neurons in 
the hippocampus was increased to 116~120% of the control in 
the LCF group. However, there were no statistically significant 
differences.

DISCUSSION

The present study demonstrated that TMT injections produced 
severe deficits in rat performance in a Morris water maze along 
with signs of neurodegeration, including decreased ChAT 
and cAMP activity in the hippocampus. Treatment with LCF 
attenuated TMT-induced learning and memory deficits in the 
maze and had a protective effect against TMT-induced decrease in 
ChAT and cAMP positive neurons.
Intozication with trimethyltin (TMT) leads to profound be ha vio-
ural and cognitive deficits in both humans (Fortemps et al., 1978) and 
experimental animals (Dyer et al., 1982a, b; Ishida et al., 1997). In 
rats, TMT induced the degeneration of pyramidal neurons in the 
hippocampus and cortical areas (pyriform cortex, entorhinal cor-
tex, subiculum) connected to the hippocampus, but there is also 
neuronal loss in the association areas (Brown et al., 1979; Chang 
and Dyer, 1983a, b; Chang et al., 1983a, b; Chang and Dyer, 1985; 
Balaban et al., 1988; Koczyk et al., 1996a, b). 
Futhermore, behavioural studies have shown increased dis-
rup tion in memory and learning deficits in TMT-intoxicated 
rats (Swartzwelder et al., 1982; Andersson et al., 1995). TMT in-
toxication impairs the acquisition of water maze performance 
(Hagan et al., 1988; Segal, 1988; Earley et al., 1992). The Morris 
water maze is well-established paradigm for evaluating deficits 
in hi ppocampal-dependent memory and the MWM spatial lear-
ning task has been used in the validation of rodent models for 
neurocognitive disorders and for the evaluation of possible neuro-
cognitive treatments (D’Hooge and De Deyn, 2001; Luine et al., 
2003). The impairment in spatial learning produced by TMT in 
the current studies is consistent with previous reports of spatial 
lear ning impairments (Walsh et al., 1982a, b; Hagan et al., 1988; 
Earley et al., 1992; Alessandri et al., 1994). However, this study 
proved that spatial memory continued to improve in LCF group 
du ring the training days compared to the control group. Also, the 
data of spatial probe trial demonstrated that LCF protects against 
the TMT-induced decrease of the spatial retention, especially 
long-term memory. It has been previously reported that LCF has 
profound curative effects on improving the memory and cognitive 
function of AD-like animal model (Sun et al., 2003). Also, Deng et 
al showed that the treatment of Lucium barbarum polysaccharide, 
a compound of LCF, enhanced the learning and memory abilities 
in the rats (Deng et al., 2003). These results proved that LCF 
ameliorated disordered learning of TMT induced rat.
The neuroprotective effects of these herbal drugs on the central 
acetylcholine system were also examined by histochemistry of 
hippocampal neurons. The degeneration of the cholinergic inner-
vation from the basal forebrain to the hippocampal formation in 

140

the temporal lobe is thought to be one of the factors determining 
the progression of memory decay, both during normal aging and 
AD (Wu et al., 1999). The best available marker for cholinergic 
neurons in the basal forebrain is ChAT activity. ChAT synthesizes 
the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, basal forebrain and the cortex, 
hippocampus, and amygdala. A significant reduction in ChAT 
activity in the postmortem brains of demented patients has been 
reported. In addition, there is a 20-50% decrease in ChAT activity 
in the hippocampus of the TMT-induced rats. However, LCF 
modulates the function of these neurons and plays a role in their 
maintenance by preventing the TMT-induced decrease in ChAT 
activity (Rabbani et al., 1997; Chen et al., 2000). The present 
results show that LCF exerts beneficial effects on cholinergic 
neurotransmission in the brain by increasing the hippocampus 
ChAT activities.
In the brain, activation of cAMP signaling occurs after stimu la-
tion of adenylyl cylases by stimulatory G-proteins after binding of 
an extracellular ligand to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 
and by Ca2+ through the Ca2+ -binding protein calmodulin (Wang 
and Strom, 2003). Genetic and pharmacological studies provide 
strong evidence that the cAMP signaling pathway is crucial for 
learning and memory across species (Kandal, 2004; Shoulakis and 
Grammenoudi, 2006). However, critical questions remain about 
the potential of this pathway as a target for memory enhancement 
because of contradictory results from pharmacological and 
genetic studies. Our results showed that the levels of cAMP in the 
hippocampus had no significant difference among the groups. 
It has been previously reported that short-term memory may be 
dependent on cAMP signaling (Ahi et al., 2004) and that it may be 
enhanced after pharmacological immediate posttraining increases 
of hippocampal cAMP (Vianna et al., 2000). In contrast, by using 
our conditional system, there was no close relation between 
enhancement of memory and the change of cAMP expression in 
the hippocampus on TMT- induced rats. 
In summary, treatment with LCF attenuated TMT-induced 
learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze and had 
a protective effect against TMT-induced decreased in cholinergic 
neurons. LCF is thus a good candidate for further investigations 
that may ultimately result in its clinical use. Further work 
examining the effects of LCF activation on additional behavioral 
tasks will help to elucidate whether increasing cAMP signaling 
may also facilitate other types of memory.
