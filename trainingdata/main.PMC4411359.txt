13.11.001 Abstract The thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a multifunctional enzyme, which is essential for embryonic development.
It mediates the base excision repair (BER) of G:T and G:U DNA mismatches arising from the deamination of 5-methyl cytosine (5-MeC) and cytosine, respectively.
Recent studies have pointed at a role of TDG during the active demethylation of 5-MeC within CpG islands.
TDG interacts with the histone acetylase CREB-binding protein (CBP) to activate CBP-dependent transcription.
In addition, TDG also interacts with the retinoic acid receptor a (RARa), resulting in the activation of RARa target genes.
Here we provide evidence for the existence of a functional ternary complex containing TDG, CBP and activated RARa.
Using global transcriptome profiling, we uncover a coupling of de novo methylation-sensitive and RA-dependent transcription, which coincides with a significant subset of CBP target genes.
The introduction of a point mutation in TDG, which neither affects overall protein structure nor BER activity, leads to a significant loss in ternary complex stability, resulting in the deregulation of RA targets involved in necke AG).

We thus demonstrate for the first time a direct coupling of TDGs epigenomic and transcription regulatory function through ternary complexes with CBP and RARa.
Introduction The base excision repair (BER) enzyme thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) plays an important role in the maintenance of genetic stability by correcting guanine:thymine (G:T) and guanine:uracil (G:U) DNA mismatches [1,2].
These mispaired basepairs arise from the spontaneous or catalyzed deamination of 5-methyl cytosine (5-MeC) at CpG sites and cytosine, respectively and would, if uncorrected, lead to G:C to A:T transitions [3,4].
Depending on their location within the genome, such mutations can result in the loss of CpG dinucleotides with potential impact on gene regulation or in codon changes within coding regions, both of which can have serious consequences such as cancer formation [5,6].
Apart from its function during BER, TDG interacts with the retinoic acid receptor a (RARa) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) in a ligand-independent manner to enhance receptor affinity for their DNA target sites [7].
RAR and RXR belong to a family of ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors, which form homo-or heterodimers in order to activate gene expression via binding to RA response elements (RAREs) in target promoters [8].
In the absence of ligand, the RXR/RARa heterodimer represses transcription by recruiting corepressors such as NCOR1, SMRT (NCOR2) and histone deacetylases [9,10], whereas ligand binding mediates a conformational change, allowing the recruitment of coactivators such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the basic transcription machinery [11,12].
RARa can be activated by all-trans RA (atRA) and 9-cis RA (9cRA), while RXR activation is restricted to 9cRA only.
Moreover, TDG interacts with the HATs CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, thereby enhancing their gene expression-activating capacities [13].
CBP and p300 are highly related coactivators for a variety of transcription factors, including CREB, the AP-1 proteins Jun and Fos, nuclear receptors and the tumor suppressor p53 [14].
Via their HAT activity, CBP/p300 are involved in chromatin remodeling at target promoters in order to activate gene expression [15,16].
As reported for TDG, CBP has also been shown to interact with RAR, leading to the increased expression of RARE-driven reporters; but unlike TDG, the binding of CBP is limited to ligand-activated RAR [17].
In line with these findings, a CBP knockdown results in decreased expression of RARE-driven reporters [18].
Recent studies are pointing at an involvement of the BER pathway in DNA demethylation [19].
In this context, TDG may play a dual role in active demethylation as well as in the inhibition of de novo DNA methylation, since it has been shown to inhibit the activity of the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b [20,21].
The homozygous knockout of TDG leads to strong developmental defects and prenatal death in mice [22,23].
Notably, some of the specific lethal phenotypes of TDG null mice are comparable to those previously described for CBP-knockout mouse embryos and for defects in RA signaling [24,25].
The promoters of down-regulated genes in TDG-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) show a decreased CBP-binding [22] and elevated levels of CpG methylation, supporting a role of TDG in DNA demethylation [22,23].
Here, we investigate the interplay of RA-dependent and DNA methylation-sensitive transcription with CBP target genes in HEK293 cells.
We provide evidence for a functional ternary complex composed of TDG, CBP and activated RARa, which consistently controls the expression of RAdependent target genes that are involved in important cellular processes such as DNA replication, cell survival or cell cycle regulation.
Results and discussion RA-dependent transcription coincides with de novo methylation-sensitive gene expression Given that TDG influences RARa-and CBP-dependent gene expression and in view of a direct involvement of TDG in the active demethylation of 5-MeC within CpG contexts, we investigated whether there is coherence in gene expression regulation between these different pathways, which would point at TDG as a connector of epigenetic DNA modification, RA and CBP gene regulatory functions.
We compared gene expression profiles of HEK293 cells overexpressing CBP with those of RA and 5-aza-20-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC)-treated cells (Figure 1).
Incorporation of 5aza-dC has been shown to efficiently decrease de novo DNA methylation by an irreversible inhibition of Dnmt activity [26].
As expected by the transcription activating roles of CBP, RA and DNA demethylation, all three conditions resulted in gene activation in the majority of cases (Figure 1A).
Thereby, overexpression of CBP results in the statistically significant up-regulation of 1344 genes and down-regulation of 534 genes (P < 0.01) (Figure 1A, left panel).
RA treatment leads to the up-regulation of 418 genes and down-regulation of 20 genes (Figure 1A, middle panel) and the inhibition of de novo methylation by 5-aza-dC treatment affects the expression of 174 genes, of which expression of 145 and 29 genes is up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively (Figure 1A, right panel).
When comparing the regulated gene sets of all three conditions, we observe statistically significant common subsets of 256 (RA-vs. CBP-regulated genes), 102 (5-aza-dCvs.
CBP-regulated genes) and 94 (RA-vs. 5-aza-dC-regulated) genes, as indicated by the corresponding hypergeometric distribution P values (Figure 1B).
Moreover, there are 86 genes of each common subset, which are statistically significantly regulated in all three conditions (Figure 1B, red).
Comparing the log2 fold changes in gene expression upon RA treatment with those upon 5-aza-dC treatment reveals a highly significant (P< 0.001) positive correlation (R = 0.76, red), which is even retained when comparing those genes significantly regulated in only one of the two conditions (R = 0.72, 5-aza-dC, brown; R = 0.57, RA, green; Figure 1C, left panel).
In similar comparisons, the CBP target genes split up into two groups.

Notably, the whole sets of 5-aza-dC targets and RA targets retained responsiveness to CBP, as indicated by the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.66 (middle panel) and 0.78 (right panel), respectively (Figure 1C).
We validated our findings in human HEK293 cells using COS7 cells from the African green monkey and revealed the same strong positive correlation between CBP, RA and 5-aza-dC target genes in a different species (Figure S1).
Taken together, these results support a direct linkage between CBP-mediated gene activation and CpG demethylation at promoter sites of RA target genes.
The classical RA pathway includes ligandmediated activation of homo-or heterodimers of RAR and RXR bound to RAREs in the promoter region of target genes, which subsequently affects gene expression directly or via the recruitment of other transcription factors [27].
Our findings suggest that gene activation by RA may include active or passive DNA demethylation of CpG and potentially also of nonCpG sites in gene promoters.
Indeed, several recent studies have linked RA treatment with a global loss of CpG methylation in HL-60 and U937 cell lines [28].
RA has been shown to up-regulate the expression of the tumor suppressors p16 and p21 as well as E-cadherin expression by inducing promoter hypomethylation [29,30].
In the case of p16 and p21, a RA-induced decrease of Dnmt expression was held responsible for promoter hypomethylation [29].
Since TDG has been shown to interact with CBP [13] and RARa [7] in a functional manner and has been associated with the active demethylation of CpG sites in gene promoters [20,21], we further investigated whether there is a TDG-dependent functional connection of these three pathways.
By using transcriptome profiling, we assessed the gene expression changes of the common subset of CBP, RA and 5-aza-dC targets upon overexpression of human TDG in HEK293 cells.
Our results unveiled that expression of all genes are concomitantly up-regulated by TDG, as judged by the highly statistically significant Pearson correlation coefficients (0.67 for RA, 0.73 for 5-aza-dC and 0.89 for CBP) (Figure 1D).
Indeed, the expression of a randomly picked, assigned set of these genes is down-regulated in mice upon knockout of murine TDG, as assessed by gene expression profiling of previously published data from TDG knockout MEFs [23], excluding the possibility that artifacts induced by the overexpression of TDG are responsible for the TDG responsiveness of these genes (Figure 1E).
A point mutation in TDG affects CBP-binding and ternary complex stability The catalytic domain of TDG, which is responsible for BER activity, is important for RARa binding (Figure 2A) [7].
The CBP binding interface of TDG is split into two distinct regions, one located in the N-terminus and including the regulatory domain, which is known to be essential for G:T but not G:U DNA repair activity [31], and the other located C-terminally (Figure 2A) [13].
The former domain is important for interacting with the HAT domain as well as the CH3 domain of CBP, while the latter one is restricted to CH3 interaction only.
Furthermore, the TDG regulatory domain contains four lysine (K) residues, which are acetylated by CBP and thus represent sites of very tight TDG/CBP interaction [13].
Hence, lysine residues are not only crucial for CBP recruitment and activity, but are also hotspots for DNA binding by establishing electrostatic interactions [32].
Notably, there is an enrichment of proline (P) residues in the regulatory domain of TDG of which several are located between two sites for CBP acetylation (Figure 2A, K59 on one hand and K83/K84/K87 on the other hand).
Proline residues are known to increase the rigidity of polypeptide chains, making these residues possibly responsible for the previously observed lack of flexibility of the regulatory domain, as compared to the extreme N-terminus of TDG [32].
Given the importance of the regulatory domain for the interaction with CBP, we hypothesize that a proline mutation in this region has the potential to modify the structural dynamics in this region, which might lead to an altered CBP affinity.
We thus generated a mutant form of TDG, TDG P65A, by introducing a proline to alanine mutation using directed mutagenesis at amino acid residue 65, which is located between the aforementioned acetylation sites.
We performed NMR studies in order to assess the structure of TDG P65A and compared it to that of wild-type TDG (Figure 2B).
Importantly the 1H15N HSQC spectrum of the mutated N-terminal domain of TDG (amino acid residues 1111, Figure 2B, left panel, red) differs from that of the wild-type TDG N-terminal counterpart (Figure 2B, left panel, black) solely by the resonances of the amino acids directly flanking the site of mutation, unveiling no global structural consequences of the mutation on the TDG N-terminus.
Similarly, in the context of the full length protein, P65A did not result in significant structural changes (Figure 2B, right panel).
The site of mutation, aside from serving as the interface with CBP, is located in the region responsible for G:T but not for G:U activity.
We therefore performed glycosylase activity assays with G:T and G:U mismatch-containing DNA substrates to examine whether glycosylase activity would be altered as a consequence of the mutation.
Our results indicated that compared to wild-type TDG (black curve), neither G:T (left panel) nor G:U (right panel) repair kinetics were significantly altered when using TDG P65A (red curve) (Figure 2C).
In order to analyze the capability of TDG P65A to interact with CBP, we performed microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments with YFP-tagged CBP and HA-fused versions of TDG P65A or wild-type TDG (Figure 3A).
The MST technique relies on the fact that molecules move in a temperature gradient from hot to cold (thermophoresis) [33,34].
Such movement is impacted by complex formation, since complexes exhibit an altered Brownian velocity when compared to their compounds in a free state.
MST techniques allow to follow the thermophoresis of a fluorescently labeled molecule (here YFP-CBP) as a function of increasing concentrations of a binding partner (here HA-TDG or HA-TDG P65A).
While these analyses with wild-type HA-TDG show saturating binding kinetics (Figure 3A, black curve, and Figure S2), HA-TDG P65A affinity for YFP-CBP is significantly decreased by a factor >3 (Figure 3A, red curve).

In the absence of TDG overexpression, RA treatment results in an approximate 75-fold increase of reporter expression, which is statistically significantly (P < 0.01) boosted by a factor greater than two in the presence of wild-type TDG (Figure 3B).
The overexpression of TDG P65A results in an approximate 1.5-fold significant (P < 0.05) boost in RA-dependent reporter expression, when compared to mock transfected cells, but the effect is significantly compromised in comparison to wild-type TDG overexpression as determined by paired students t-test (P < 0.01).
In order to investigate the effect of the P65A mutation on CBP-dependent transcription, we monitored the expression of CBP target genes defined as being responsive to CBP upon overexpression of wild-type TDG in comparison to the overexpression of TDG P65A.
The expression of CBP targets (black spots), including those among the common subset with 5-aza-dC and RA targets (red spots), is concomitantly regulated by the overexpression of wild-type TDG (Figure 3C, left panel).

Leger H et al/TDG:CBP:RAR in Transcription and Epigenomics 13 while expression of the majority of the 5-aza-dC and RA-independent CBP targets (black spots) are concomitantly regulated.
Our data indicate that the P65A mutation influences the TDG/CBP interaction as well as RA-dependent transcription activation via RARa and the transcription of CBP target genes responsive to 5-aza-dC and RA.
This could be potentially explained by a ternary complex forming between all three compounds, as it has been previously shown for TDG, RAR and the CBP-related HAT p300 [23].
In order to answer this question, we performed another set of MST experiments with YFP-CBP and dilution series of immuno-purified wild-type HA-TDG or HA-TDG P65A in the presence or absence of non-activated (green curve)/RA-activated (red curve) purified FLAG-RARa (Figures 3D and S2).
The presence of nonactivated RARa does not lead to significant alterations in CBP affinity for either wild-type or mutant TDG protein (Figure 3D, green lines versus black lines), whereas the presence of RA-activated RARa significantly increases the wild-type TDG affinity for CBP by a factor >4 (Figure 3D, left panel, red curve), but leaves the TDG P65A/CBP binding unchanged (Figure 3D, right panel, red line).
We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments of wild-type HA-TDG and HA-TDG P65A from nuclear extracts of HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of RA to verify these findings (Figure 3E).
RAR co-immunoprecipitates with both wild-type and mutant TDG proteins regardless of the presence of RA, confirming previous reports [7].
However, detectable amounts of CBP only co-precipitate with wild-type TDG in the presence of RA, strongly arguing for a ternary complex formation of TDG, CBP and activated RARa in vivo, which is destabilized by the P65A mutation of TDG.
Remarkably, such a ternary complex of TDG, RAR and p300 has been discovered recently, in which TDG is required for the p300/RAR interaction and for the recruitment of p300 to RA-regulated gene promoters [23].
Given the significantly different roles of p300 and CBP, as well as the fact that CBP directly interacts with RARs in a ligand-dependent manner in the absence of TDG, it is not only more challenging to show such a ternary complex, but also of significant interest to uncover a mutual stabilization C R el at iv e ch an ge in R Are sp on si ve ne ss C BP/h TD G P 65 A vs C BP/h TD G w t Number of genes 1 21 41 61 81 101 121 141-6-4-2 0 2 B Log2fold change CBP/hTDG wt RA vs control Lo g 2 fo ld c ha ng e C BP/h TD G P 65 A R A vs c on tro l R =-0.16 R =-0.37-4-2 2 4 6 8-4-2 2 4 6 8 A P < 0.

The fact that the P65A mutation prevents ternary complex formation with CBP and activated RARa in vitro makes TDG P65A a useful tool to functionally characterize the ternary TDG/CBP/RARa complex.
Disruption of TDG/CBP/RARa ternary complex deregulates RA-dependent gene expression In order to assess the role of the complex of TDG and CBP with activated RARa in gene expression regulation, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with wild-type TDG and CBP and compared the RA-responsive transcriptome profile with cells co-expressing TDG P65A and CBP.
Thereby, we focused on genes consistently co-regulated upon RA treatment in the wild-type TDG/CBP condition and in non-treated cells, in order to avoid side-effects caused by TDG/CBP overexpression.
In both conditions, a total of 152 genes were significantly (P < 0.05) differentially expressed upon RA treatment, among which, expression of 144 and 8 genes was up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively (Figure 4A, Conditions 1 and 4).
Notably, these genes showed similar expression changes upon 5-aza-dC treatment and CBP overexpression (Figure 4A, Conditions 2 and 3).
Assessing their differential expression upon RA treatment in the TDG P65A/CBP condition reveals a global deregulation of gene expression (Figure 4A, Condition 6).
It is worth noting that the vast majority of these genes do Leger H et al/TDG:CBP:RAR in Transcription and Epigenomics 15 not respond to RA in a significant manner when either wild-type TDG or TDG P65A is overexpressed alone (Figure 4A, Conditions 5 and 7), arguing for CBP and TDG being in conjunction important for the RA responsiveness of those genes.
A comparison of the log2-fold changes of the RA-dependent genes in the wild-type TDG/CBP condition (X axis) with those in the TDG P65A/CBP condition (Y axis) shows that expression of the majority of genes is not significantly regulated upon RA treatment in TDG P65A/CBP expressing cells (Figure 4B, black spots).
Expression of only 30 genes (20%) is significantly (P < 0.05) regulated in the TDG P65A/CBP condition as well, of which notably expression of 19 genes is regulated in the opposite manner, when compared to the wild-type TDG/CBP condition (Figure 4B, red spots).
We calculated the change in RA responsiveness caused by the introduction of TDG P65A as the difference of the RA-induced change of gene expression between TDG P65A/CBP and wild-type TDG/CBP expressing cells, which is normalized to the wild-type TDG/CBP condition (Figure 4C).
While expression of only 6 genes (4%) shows a stronger RA responsiveness in the presence of TDG P65A/CBP (Figure 4C, red), the RA responsiveness of the remaining 146 genes is severely reduced when compared to wild-type TDG/CBP (Figure 4C, blue).
Notably, we observe a set of genes, whose responsiveness to RA is inversed by the introduction of TDG P65A (Figure 4C, change in RA responsiveness lower than 1).
Conclusion Our findings point at the existence of a transcriptionally active ternary complex composed of TDG, CBP and activated RARa.
The single interactions between each two of the three compounds add up to a high affinity complex in vitro, which may activate RA-dependent gene expression in vivo in a similar way as it has been suggested for RARa, TDG and p300 [23] (Figure 5).
However, functional studies of ternary complexes composed of independent catalytically active components constitute a major challenge in vivo.
Here, we have functionally CBP RAR TDG CBP TDGRAR RA RA CBP RAR CBP RAR RA RA P65A P65A RA-dependent gene expression Figure 5 Model of ternary CBP:TDG:RAR complex action The interaction of CBP with RA-activated RARa cooperates with the interactions of TDG with CBP and RARa in order to stabilize a ternary complex composed of all three molecules, which affects the expression of RA-dependent genes (top).
The P65A mutant of TDG is still able to interact with RARa, but fails to bind CBP, resulting in the inability to form a stable functional ternary complex (bottom).
characterized a TDG point mutation, P65A, which is capable of substantially affecting ternary complex stability and transcription regulatory activity, and thus may serve as a powerful tool for future in vivo studies in order to address the biological role of the TDG/CBP/RARa complex.
The recent findings of a point mutation, R66G, in the very same region of TDG in patients with colorectal cancer further substantiates the functional importance of this region and thus may provide a link between the ternary TDG/CBP/RARa complex and the development of this pathology [32,35].
Materials and methods Plasmids The TDG P65A mutant was produced by site-directed mutagenesis, exchanging the codon for proline 65 (CCC) into an alanine codon (GCC).
TDG wt and the mutant TDG P65A were cloned into the BglII/SacI cloning sites of pSG5 plasmid (Agilent) to obtain HA-fusion proteins.
CBP was cloned into the BglII cloning site of pEYFP plasmid (Clontech).
FlagRARa fusion proteins have been described previously [7].
For bacterial expression, full-length TDG (residues 1410), its isolated N-terminal domain (residues 1111) and the corresponding P65A mutants were cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI cloning sites of pGEX-6P-1 plasmid (GE Healthcare).
Cell culture COS-7 and HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 C in 5% CO2 in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and with 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Transfections were performed using FugeneHD (Roche) according to the manufacturers instructions.
Cells were treated with a final concentration of 5 107 M atRA dissolved in ethanol or 5-aza-20-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) dissolved in DMSO for 24 h. Cells were grown to 46 105 cells/ml prior to harvesting for extract preparation.
Extract preparations Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000g for 5 min at room temperature.
The cell pellet was resuspended in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and collected by centrifugation at 5000g for 5 min at room temperature.
All subsequent steps were performed at 4 C. The cells were suspended in three volumes of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and homogenized for 30 min at 4 C, mixing the sample head-over-tail.
Cellular debris was removed by high speed centrifugation (16,000g for 10 min at 4 C).
The supernatant was subsequently dialyzed against buffer D (0.1 M KCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol) and directly used for immunoprecipitation experiments.
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously [36].
Immunoprecipitations 20 ll of anti-FLAG agarose or anti-HA agarose (Sigma Aldrich) was washed 3 times with 500 ll of IP buffer 16 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 818 (20 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA and 20% glycerol, Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20.
A 50% mixture of whole cell extracts or nuclear extracts and IP buffer was added and incubated for 1 h to overnight mixing head-over-tail at 4 C. Empty FLAG and HA expression vectors were transfected to generate the appropriate control extracts.
The bead slurry was washed 3 times using IP buffer, before the purified protein was eluted by the addition of IP elution buffer (Sigma Aldrich) and subsequently dialyzed against buffer D. In the case of co-immunoprecipitation analyses, the proteins were eluted by incubating with Laemmli sample buffer at 95 C prior to Western blot analyses.
Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad).
Western blot analyses A total of 2050 lg of soluble protein or eluates from immunopurifications were separated using SDSpolyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and incubated with blocking buffer (1 PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% skimmed milk) for 1 h at room temperature.
Blocked membranes were washed twice with PBS-T (1 PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for 5 min before incubation with a 1:2500 dilution of the primary antibody for 45 min at room temperature in PBS-T. Antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-HA (clone12CA5) antibody (Roche), mouse monoclonal antiFLAG antibody (Sigma Aldrich), rabbit polyclonal anti-CBP antibody (Santa Cruz) and mouse polyclonal anti-RAR antibody (Millipore).
Membranes were washed three times with PBS-T at room temperature for 5 min and subsequently incubated with a horseradish peroxidaseconjugated antimouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma Aldrich) at a dilution of 1:5000 in blocking buffer for 45 min at room temperature.
After three washing steps of 5 min each with PBS-T at room temperature, detection of the signals was carried out using the ECL Plus Western Blotting Substrate (Pierce).
Glycosylase activity assays Oligonucleotide primers used to generate 25-mer dsDNA containing either a central G:T or G:U mismatch basepair were as follows: 50-GAT AGG TTC CAC G(G)G TAC TCG AAG C-30 as the forward primer and 50-GCT TCG AGT AC(T/U) CGT GGA ACC TAT G-30 as the reverse primer (the nucleotides involved in the G:T(U) mismatches are written in brackets).
DNA nicking assays were performed as described previously [37] on this 25-mer dsDNA and a 25-mer dsRNA containing a central canonical G:C pair as a control.
Briefly, oligonucleotides corresponding to the complementary strand were labeled on the primary amine modified 30-end with the AlexaFluor 488 dye (Invitrogen) and oligonucleotide annealing was performed by heating 1 mM solutions for 5 min at 100 C and cooling down the mixtures slowly to room temperature.
TDG proteins were incubated at 0.5 lM final concentrations with dsDNA at 5 lM in 80 ll nicking buffer (25 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) at 37 C. 20 ll aliquots were withdrawn at different incubation time points.
DNA was precipitated in 70% ethanol solution containing 300 mM NaCl and then incubated with 0.01 N NaOH for 30 min at 50 C. Oligonucleotides were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified using a GeneGenius bioimaging system (SynGene, Ozyme).
Three independent replicates of glycosylase reactions were performed for each time point of the kinetic studies.
The enzymatic turnover was normalized by the amount of protein used, as detected by the Bradford assay.
Microscale thermophoresis Microscale thermophoresis (MST) technique capitalizes from the fact that molecules move in a temperature gradient from hot to cold (thermophoresis).
This movement is impacted by complex formation, since molecules in a complex show an altered velocity.
MST technique is used to measure the thermophoresis of a fluoresently labeled molecule (here YFP-CBP) subject to increasing concentrations of a binding partner (here immuno-purified TDG or TDG P65A).
To obtain a series of successively decreasing TDG concentrations, immuno-purified HA-TDG samples (or HA-TDG P65A) were diluted up to 14 times with buffer D (1:1, 1:4, 1:8, etc.).
The same amount of YFP-CBP containing cellular extract was added to each dilution in the presence or absence of immuno-purified FLAG-tagged RARa either in the presence or in the absence of RA.
The reaction conditions were set to 20 mM MgCl2.
MST experiments were conducted using a Monolith NT.115 (Nanotemper Technologies) as described previously [33,34] (laser-power 20%, laser-on time 60s, LED-power 30%).
Luciferase reporter assays Cells were transfected with a mixture of plasmids containing 1 lg 17-mer b-globin-Luc, 50 ng pRL SV40, 50 ng Gal4hRARa 1.5 lg pSG5-hTDGwt or pSG5-hTDG P65A and 1.5 lg pSG5 DNA in 50 ll total volume to which 12 ll of Exgen 500 (Fermentas) was added according to the manufacturers instructions.
After 6 h, the transfection reaction was stopped by adding 180 ll of DMEM to each well.
Then cells were treated with atRA at 5 107 M for 24 h. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 20 ll of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) at room temperature for 15 min before reading.
Luciferase activity was subsequently measured using GloMax-96 Microplate Luminometer (Promega) according to the manufacturers instructions and normalized by protein amounts.

Protein expression and purification were performed as described previously [37,38].
NMR experiments were performed at 293 K on a Bruker DMX 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe head.
All 1H spectra were calibrated with 1 mM sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-d(3,30,2,20)propionate as a reference.
All 1H15N HSQC spectra were recorded in an aqueous buffer composed of 100 mM NaiPO4 pH 6.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 5% D2O.
1H15N Leger H et al/TDG:CBP:RAR in Transcription and Epigenomics 17 HSQC spectra were recorded on 100 lM samples of 15N-labeled proteins with 128 scans per increment and 128 dummy scans, 128 points in the nitrogen dimension and 1024 points in the proton dimension.

Themicroarray datawere extracted using the Bioconductor limma package [39] and median normalized.
Data quality was determined using a QC procedure [40].
Data were normalized using NeONORM with k = 0.02 [4143].
Subtraction profiling was performed as described previously [44,45] using the CDS test [46].
Differentially expressed genes were classified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software to detect network-and pathway-enrichments.
