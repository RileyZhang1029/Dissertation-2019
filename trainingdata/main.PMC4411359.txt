It mediates the base excision repair (BER) of G:T and G:U DNA mis- matches arising from the deamination of 5-methyl cytosine (5-MeC) and cytosine, respectively.
Recent studies have pointed at a role of TDG during the active demethylation of 5-MeC within CpG islands.
TDG interacts with the histone acetylase CREB-binding protein (CBP) to activate CBP-dependent transcription.
In addition, TDG also interacts with the retinoic acid receptor a (RARa), resulting in the activation of RARa target genes.
Here we provide evidence for the exis- tence of a functional ternary complex containing TDG, CBP and activated RARa.
Using global transcriptome proﬁling, we uncover a coupling of de novo methylation-sensitive and RA-dependent transcription, which coincides with a signiﬁcant subset of CBP target genes.
The introduction of a point mutation in TDG, which neither affects overall protein structure nor BER activity, leads to a signiﬁcant loss in ternary complex stability, resulting in the deregulation of RA targets involved in  * Corresponding author.

We thus demonstrate for the ﬁrst time a direct coupling of TDG s epigenomic and transcription regulatory function through ternary complexes with CBP and RARa.
Introduction  The base excision repair (BER) enzyme thymine DNA glycosy- lase (TDG) plays an important role in the maintenance of ge- netic stability by correcting guanine:thymine (G:T) and guanine:uracil (G:U) DNA mismatches [1,2].
These mispaired basepairs arise from the spontaneous or catalyzed deamination of 5-methyl cytosine (5-MeC) at CpG sites and cytosine, respectively and would, if uncorrected, lead to G:C to A:T transitions [3,4].
Depending on their location within the gen- ome, such mutations can result in the loss of CpG dinucleo- tides with potential impact on gene regulation or in codon changes within coding regions, both of which can have serious consequences such as cancer formation [5,6].
Apart from its function during BER, TDG interacts with the retinoic acid receptor a (RARa) and the retinoid X recep- tor (RXR) in a ligand-independent manner to enhance recep- tor afﬁnity for their DNA target sites [7].
RAR and RXR belong to a family of ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors, which form homo- or heterodimers in order to activate gene expression via binding to RA response elements (RAREs) in target promoters [8].
In the absence of ligand, the RXR/ RARa heterodimer represses transcription by recruiting core- pressors such as NCOR1, SMRT (NCOR2) and histone deacetylases [9,10], whereas ligand binding mediates a confor- mational change, allowing the recruitment of coactivators such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the basic transcrip- tion machinery [11,12].
RARa can be activated by all-trans RA (atRA) and 9-cis RA (9cRA), while RXR activation is restricted to 9cRA only.
Moreover, TDG interacts with the HATs CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, thereby enhancing their gene expres- sion-activating capacities [13].
CBP and p300 are highly related coactivators for a variety of transcription factors, including CREB, the AP-1 proteins Jun and Fos, nuclear receptors and the tumor suppressor p53 [14].
Via their HAT activity, CBP/p300 are involved in chromatin remodeling at target pro- moters in order to activate gene expression [15,16].
As reported for TDG, CBP has also been shown to interact with RAR, leading to the increased expression of RARE-driven reporters  but unlike TDG, the binding of CBP is limited to ligand-acti- vated RAR [17].
In line with these ﬁndings, a CBP knockdown results in decreased expression of RARE-driven reporters [18].
Recent studies are pointing at an involvement of the BER pathway in DNA demethylation [19].
In this context, TDG may play a dual role in active demethylation as well as in the inhibition of de novo DNA methylation, since it has been shown to inhibit the activity of the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b [20,21].
The homozygous knockout of TDG leads to strong developmental defects and prenatal death in mice [22,23].
Notably, some of the speciﬁc lethal phenotypes of TDG null mice are comparable to those previously de- scribed for CBP-knockout mouse embryos and for defects in RA signaling [24,25].
The promoters of down-regulated genes in TDG-deﬁcient mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) show a decreased CBP-binding [22] and elevated levels of CpG  methylation, supporting a role of TDG in DNA demethylation [22,23].
Here, we investigate the interplay of RA-dependent and DNA methylation-sensitive transcription with CBP target genes in HEK293 cells.
We provide evidence for a functional ternary complex composed of TDG, CBP and activated RARa, which consistently controls the expression of RA- dependent target genes that are involved in important cellular processes such as DNA replication, cell survival or cell cycle regulation.
Results and discussion  RA-dependent transcription coincides with de novo methylation-sensitive gene expression  Given that TDG inﬂuences RARa- and CBP-dependent gene expression and in view of a direct involvement of TDG in the active demethylation of 5-MeC within CpG contexts, we investigated whether there is coherence in gene expression regulation between these different pathways, which would point at TDG as a connector of epigenetic DNA modiﬁcation, RA and CBP gene regulatory functions.
We compared gene expression proﬁles of HEK293 cells overexpressing CBP with those of RA and 5-aza-20-deoxycyti- dine (5-aza-dC)-treated cells (Figure 1).
Incorporation of 5- aza-dC has been shown to efﬁciently decrease de novo DNA methylation by an irreversible inhibition of Dnmt activity [26].
As expected by the transcription activating roles of CBP, RA and DNA demethylation, all three conditions re- sulted in gene activation in the majority of cases (Figure 1A).
Thereby, overexpression of CBP results in the statistically sig- niﬁcant up-regulation of 1344 genes and down-regulation of 534 genes (P   0.01) (Figure 1A, left panel).
RA treatment leads to the up-regulation of 418 genes and down-regulation of 20 genes (Figure 1A, middle panel) and the inhibition of de novo methylation by 5-aza-dC treatment affects the expres- sion of 174 genes, of which expression of 145 and 29 genes is up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively (Figure 1A, right panel).
When comparing the regulated gene sets of all three conditions, we observe statistically signiﬁcant common subsets of 256 (RA- vs. CBP-regulated genes), 102 (5-aza-dC- vs. CBP-regulated genes) and 94 (RA- vs. 5-aza-dC-regulated) genes, as indicated by the corresponding hypergeometric distri- bution P values (Figure 1B).
Moreover, there are 86 genes of each common subset, which are statistically signiﬁcantly regu- lated in all three conditions (Figure 1B, red).
Comparing the log2 fold changes in gene expression upon RA treatment with those upon 5-aza-dC treatment reveals a highly signiﬁcant (P   0.001) positive correlation (R = 0.76, red), which is even retained when comparing those genes signiﬁcantly regulated in only one of the two conditions (R = 0.72, 5-aza-dC, brown  R = 0.57, RA, green  Figure 1C, left panel).
In similar com- parisons, the CBP target genes split up into two groups.

Notably, the whole sets of 5-aza-dC targets and RA targets retained responsiveness to CBP, as indicated by the corresponding Pearson correlation coefﬁcients of 0.66 (middle panel) and 0.78 (right panel), respectively (Figure 1C).
We validated our ﬁndings in human HEK293 cells using COS- 7 cells from the African green monkey and revealed the same strong positive correlation between CBP, RA and 5-aza-dC target genes in a different species (Figure S1).
Taken together, these results support a direct linkage between CBP-mediated gene activation and CpG demethylation at promoter sites of RA target genes.
The classical RA pathway includes ligand- mediated activation of homo- or heterodimers of RAR and RXR bound to RAREs in the promoter region of target genes, which subsequently affects gene expression directly or via the recruitment of other transcription factors [27].
Our ﬁndings suggest that gene activation by RA may include active or pas- sive DNA demethylation of CpG and potentially also of non- CpG sites in gene promoters.
Indeed, several recent studies have linked RA treatment with a global loss of CpG methyla- tion in HL-60 and U937 cell lines [28].
RA has been shown to up-regulate the expression of the tumor suppressors p16 and p21 as well as E-cadherin expression by inducing promoter hypomethylation [29,30].
In the case of p16 and p21, a RA-in- duced decrease of Dnmt expression was held responsible for promoter hypomethylation [29].
Since TDG has been shown to interact with CBP [13] and RARa [7] in a functional manner and has been associated with the active demethylation of CpG sites in gene promoters [20,21], we further investigated whether there is a TDG-depen- dent functional connection of these three pathways.
By using transcriptome proﬁling, we assessed the gene expression changes of the common subset of CBP, RA and 5-aza-dC tar- gets upon overexpression of human TDG in HEK293 cells.
Our results unveiled that expression of all genes are concomi- tantly up-regulated by TDG, as judged by the highly statisti- cally signiﬁcant Pearson correlation coefﬁcients (0.67 for RA, 0.73 for 5-aza-dC and 0.89 for CBP) (Figure 1D).
Indeed, the expression of a randomly picked, assigned set of these genes is down-regulated in mice upon knockout of murine TDG, as assessed by gene expression proﬁling of previously published data from TDG knockout MEFs [23], excluding the possibility that artifacts induced by the overexpression of TDG are responsible for the TDG responsiveness of these genes (Figure 1E).
A point mutation in TDG affects CBP-binding and ternary complex stability  The catalytic domain of TDG, which is responsible for BER activity, is important for RARa binding (Figure 2A) [7].
The CBP binding interface of TDG is split into two distinct re- gions, one located in the N-terminus and including the regula- tory domain, which is known to be essential for G:T but not G:U DNA repair activity [31], and the other located C-termi- nally (Figure 2A) [13].
The former domain is important for interacting with the HAT domain as well as the CH3 domain  of CBP, while the latter one is restricted to CH3 interaction only.
Furthermore, the TDG regulatory domain contains four lysine (K) residues, which are acetylated by CBP and thus rep- resent sites of very tight TDG/CBP interaction [13].
Hence, ly- sine residues are not only crucial for CBP recruitment and activity, but are also hotspots for DNA binding by establishing electrostatic interactions [32].
Notably, there is an enrichment of proline (P) residues in the regulatory domain of TDG of which several are located between two sites for CBP acetyla- tion (Figure 2A, K59 on one hand and K83/K84/K87 on the other hand).
Proline residues are known to increase the rigidity of polypeptide chains, making these residues possibly respon- sible for the previously observed lack of ﬂexibility of the regu- latory domain, as compared to the extreme N-terminus of TDG [32].
Given the importance of the regulatory domain for the interaction with CBP, we hypothesize that a proline mutation in this region has the potential to modify the struc- tural dynamics in this region, which might lead to an altered CBP afﬁnity.
We thus generated a mutant form of TDG, TDG P65A, by introducing a proline to alanine mutation using directed mutagenesis at amino acid residue 65, which is located between the aforementioned acetylation sites.
We performed NMR studies in order to assess the structure of TDG P65A and com- pared it to that of wild-type TDG (Figure 2B).
Importantly the 1H 15N HSQC spectrum of the mutated N-terminal domain of TDG (amino acid residues 1 111, Figure 2B, left panel, red) differs from that of the wild-type TDG N-terminal counterpart (Figure 2B, left panel, black) solely by the resonances of the amino acids directly ﬂanking the site of mutation, unveiling no global structural consequences of the mutation on the TDG N-terminus.
Similarly, in the context of the full length protein, P65A did not result in signiﬁcant structural changes (Figure 2B, right panel).
The site of mutation, aside from serving as the interface with CBP, is located in the region responsible for G:T but not for G:U activity.
We therefore performed glycosylase activity assays with G:T and G:U mismatch-containing DNA substrates to examine whether glycosylase activity would be altered as a consequence of the mutation.
Our results indi- cated that compared to wild-type TDG (black curve), neither G:T (left panel) nor G:U (right panel) repair kinetics were signiﬁcantly altered when using TDG P65A (red curve) (Figure 2C).
In order to analyze the capability of TDG P65A to interact with CBP, we performed microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments with YFP-tagged CBP and HA-fused versions of TDG P65A or wild-type TDG (Figure 3A).
The MST tech- nique relies on the fact that molecules move in a temperature gradient from hot to cold (thermophoresis) [33,34].
Such movement is impacted by complex formation, since complexes exhibit an altered Brownian velocity when compared to their compounds in a free state.
MST techniques allow to follow the thermophoresis of a ﬂuorescently labeled molecule (here YFP-CBP) as a function of increasing concentrations of a binding partner (here HA-TDG or HA-TDG P65A).
While these analyses with wild-type HA-TDG show saturating bind- ing kinetics (Figure 3A, black curve, and Figure S2), HA-TDG P65A afﬁnity for YFP-CBP is signiﬁcantly decreased by a factor  3 (Figure 3A, red curve).
To investigate  effects of TDG P65A on the RA-mediated transactivation of RARa-dependent genes, we  the   12  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 8 18  A  CBP  RARα  G:T repair  G:U repair  RD  N  1  51  111  CAT  C  362  410  EPVQEAPKGRKRKPRTTEPKQPVEPKKPVESKKSGKSAKSKEKQEKITDTFKVKRKVDRF K acetylation site of TDG by CBP Pproline 65 B  ppm 108 8 0 110 2 112 4 114 6 116 8 118 0 120 2 122 4 124 6 126 8 128 0 130 8.8  15N  R66  K64  A65  8.4  8.6  8.2  8.0  8.8  7.8 1H  8.6  8.4  8.2  8.0  7.8  ppm  C  )  %  (   r e v o n r u t   c i t a m y z n E  20 15 10 5 0  G:T activity  hTDG wt hTDG P65A  0  20  40  60  Time (min)  80  )  %  (   r e v o n r u t   c i t a m y z n E  30  20  10  0  0  20  G:U activity  40  60  Time (min)  80  Structure and activity of wild type TDG and the mutant P65A  Figure 2 A.

The overexpression of TDG P65A results in an approximate 1.5-fold signiﬁcant (P   0.05) boost in RA-dependent reporter expression, when compared to mock transfected cells, but is signiﬁcantly compromised in comparison to wild-type TDG  the effect  t-test overexpression as determined by paired students (P   0.01).

Co-immnoprecipitated proteins were monitored for RAR and CBP using the appropriate antibodies.

(black spots) are  Our data indicate that the P65A mutation inﬂuences the TDG/CBP interaction as well as RA-dependent transcription activation via RARa and the transcription of CBP target genes responsive to 5-aza-dC and RA.
This could be potentially explained by a ternary complex forming between all three compounds, as it has been previously shown for TDG, RAR and the CBP-related HAT p300 [23].
In order to answer this question, we performed another set of MST experiments with YFP-CBP and dilution series of immuno-puriﬁed wild-type HA-TDG or HA-TDG P65A in the presence or absence of non-activated (green curve) / RA-activated (red curve) puriﬁed FLAG-RARa (Figures 3D and S2).
The presence of non- activated RARa does not lead to signiﬁcant alterations in CBP afﬁnity for either wild-type or mutant TDG protein (Figure 3D, green lines versus black lines), whereas the presence of RA-activated RARa signiﬁcantly increases the wild-type TDG afﬁnity for CBP by a factor  4 (Figure 3D,  left panel, red curve), but leaves the TDG P65A/CBP binding unchanged (Figure 3D, right panel, red line).
We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments of wild-type HA-TDG and HA-TDG P65A from nuclear extracts of HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of RA to verify these ﬁndings (Figure 3E).
RAR co-immunoprecipitates with both wild-type and mutant TDG proteins regardless of the presence of RA, conﬁrming previous reports [7].
However, detectable amounts of CBP only co-precipitate with wild-type TDG in the presence of RA, strongly arguing for a ternary complex formation of TDG, CBP and activated RARa in vivo, which is destabilized by the P65A mutation of TDG.
Remarkably, such a ternary complex of TDG, RAR and p300 has been discovered recently, in which TDG is required for the p300/RAR interaction and for the recruitment of p300 to RA-regulated gene promoters [23].
Given the signiﬁcantly different roles of p300 and CBP, as well as the fact that CBP directly interacts with RARs in a ligand-dependent manner in the absence of TDG, it is not only more challenging to show such a ternary complex, but also of signiﬁcant interest to uncover a mutual stabilization   14  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 8 18  A Condition  s e n e g    f  o   r e b m u N  140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0  B  l  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  CBP/  hTDG wt  hTDG wt  CBP/  hTDG P65A  hTDG P65A  C d - a z a - 5  l  l  l  o r t n o C  o r t n o C L S S L S S L S S L S S  o r t n o C  k c o M  P B C  A R  A R  l  o r t n o C L S S  A R  l  o r t n A o C R L S S  P  l  o r t n A o C R L S S  P  P  P  P   0.05  L -   0.0  +   -2.0 +2.0  S  0  10    1.0  P 0  0.1  P   0.05 C  t  e g n a h c   d o f 2 g o L  l     o r t n o c   s v   A R A 5 6 P G D T h / P B C     8 6 4 2  -2 -4  -4  -2  R = -0.37 R = -0.16  2  4  6  8  Log2fold change  CBP/hTDG wt RA vs control    n i   e g n a h c   e v i t a e R  l  i  s s e n e v s n o p s e r -  A R  2  0  -2  -4  -6     w G D T h / P B C   s v   A 5 6 P G D T h / P B C     1  21 41  61 81 101 121 141  Number of genes  Figure 4 TDG P65A inﬂuences the expression of genes sensitive to de novo DNA demethylation, RA and CBP A.

within the complex.
The fact that the P65A mutation prevents ternary complex formation with CBP and activated RARa in vitro makes TDG P65A a useful tool to functionally charac- terize the ternary TDG/CBP/RARa complex.
Disruption of TDG/CBP/RARa ternary complex deregulates RA-dependent gene expression  In order to assess the role of the complex of TDG and CBP with activated RARa in gene expression regulation, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with wild-type TDG and CBP and compared the RA-responsive transcriptome proﬁle with cells co-expressing TDG P65A and CBP.
Thereby, we focused  on genes consistently co-regulated upon RA treatment in the wild-type TDG/CBP condition and in non-treated cells, in order to avoid side-effects caused by TDG/CBP overexpres- sion.
In both conditions, a total of 152 genes were signiﬁcantly (P   0.05) differentially expressed upon RA treatment, among which, expression of 144 and 8 genes was up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively (Figure 4A, Conditions 1 and 4).
Notably, these genes showed similar expression changes upon 5-aza-dC treatment and CBP overexpression (Figure 4A, Conditions 2 and 3).
Assessing their differential expression upon RA treatment in the TDG P65A/CBP condition reveals a global deregulation of gene expression (Figure 4A, Condition 6).
It is worth noting that the vast majority of these genes do   Le ger H et al / TDG:CBP:RAR in Transcription and Epigenomics  15  not respond to RA in a signiﬁcant manner when either wild-type TDG or TDG P65A is overexpressed alone (Figure 4A, Conditions 5 and 7), arguing for CBP and TDG being in conjunction important for the RA responsiveness of those genes.
A comparison of the log2-fold changes of the RA-dependent genes in the wild-type TDG/CBP condition (X axis) with those in the TDG P65A/CBP condition (Y axis) shows that expression of the majority of genes is not signiﬁ- cantly regulated upon RA treatment in TDG P65A/CBP expressing cells (Figure 4B, black spots).
Expression of only 30 genes (20%) is signiﬁcantly (P   0.05) regulated in the TDG P65A/CBP condition as well, of which notably expres- sion of 19 genes is regulated in the opposite manner, when compared to the wild-type TDG/CBP condition (Figure 4B, red spots).
We calculated the change in RA responsiveness caused by the introduction of TDG P65A as the difference of the RA-induced change of gene expression between TDG P65A/CBP and wild-type TDG/CBP expressing cells, which is normalized to the wild-type TDG/CBP condition (Figure 4C).
While expression of only 6 genes (4%) shows a stronger RA responsiveness in the presence of TDG P65A/ CBP (Figure 4C, red), the RA responsiveness of the remaining 146 genes is severely reduced when compared to wild-type TDG/CBP (Figure 4C, blue).
Notably, we observe a set of genes, whose responsiveness to RA is inversed by the introduc- tion of TDG P65A (Figure 4C, change in RA responsiveness lower than  1).
characterized a TDG point mutation, P65A, which is capable of substantially affecting ternary complex stability and transcription regulatory activity, and thus may serve as a powerful tool for future in vivo studies in order to address the biological role of the TDG/CBP/RARa complex.
The recent ﬁndings of a point mutation, R66G, in the very same region of TDG in patients with colorectal cancer further substantiates the functional importance of this region and thus may provide a link between the ternary TDG/CBP/RARa complex and the development of this pathology [32,35].
Materials and methods  Plasmids  The TDG P65A mutant was produced by site-directed muta- genesis, exchanging the codon for proline 65 (CCC) into an alanine codon (GCC).
TDG wt and the mutant TDG P65A were cloned into the BglII/SacI cloning sites of pSG5 plasmid (Agilent) to obtain HA-fusion proteins.
CBP was cloned into the BglII cloning site of pEYFP plasmid (Clontech).
Flag- RARa fusion proteins have been described previously [7].
For bacterial expression, full-length TDG (residues 1 410), its isolated N-terminal domain (residues 1 111) and the corre- sponding P65A mutants were cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI cloning sites of pGEX-6P-1 plasmid (GE Healthcare).
Conclusion  Cell culture  Our ﬁndings point at the existence of a transcriptionally active ternary complex composed of TDG, CBP and activated RARa.
The single interactions between each two of the three compounds add up to a high afﬁnity complex in vitro, which may activate RA-dependent gene expression in vivo in a similar way as it has been suggested for RARa, TDG and p300 [23] (Figure 5).
However, functional studies of ternary complexes composed of independent catalytically active components con- stitute a major challenge in vivo.
Here, we have functionally  CBP  RARα  TDG  CBP  RA  RA  CBP  RARα  RA  TDG  CBP  RARα  P65A  RARα  RA  P65A  RA-dependent  gene expression  Figure 5 Model of ternary CBP:TDG:RAR complex action The interaction of CBP with RA-activated RARa cooperates with the interactions of TDG with CBP and RARa in order to stabilize a ternary complex composed of all three molecules, which affects the expression of RA-dependent genes (top).
The P65A mutant of TDG is still able to interact with RARa, but fails to bind CBP, resulting in the inability to form a stable functional ternary complex (bottom).
COS-7 and HEK293 cells were cultured at 37  C in 5% CO2 in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and with 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Transfections were performed using FugeneHD (Roche) according to the manufacturer s instructions.
Cells were treated with a ﬁnal concentration of 5   10 7 M atRA dissolved in ethanol or 5-aza-20-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) dissolved in DMSO for 24 h. Cells were grown to 4 6   105 cells/ml prior to harvesting for extract preparation.
Extract preparations  Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 min at room temperature.
The cell pellet was resuspended in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and collected by centrifuga- tion at 5000 g for 5 min at room temperature.
All subsequent steps were performed at 4  C. The cells were suspended in three volumes of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and homog- enized for 30 min at 4  C, mixing the sample head-over-tail.
Cellular debris was removed by high speed centrifugation (16,000 g for 10 min at 4  C).
The supernatant was subse- quently dialyzed against buffer D (0.1 M KCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol) and directly used for immunoprecipitation experiments.
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously [36].
Immunoprecipitations  20 ll of anti-FLAG agarose or anti-HA agarose (Sigma Aldrich) was washed 3 times with 500 ll of IP buffer   16  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 8 18  (20 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA and 20% glycerol, Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20.
A 50% mixture of whole cell extracts or nuclear extracts and IP buffer was added and incubated for 1 h to overnight mixing head-over-tail at 4  C. Empty FLAG and HA expression vectors were transfected to generate the appropriate control extracts.
The bead slurry was washed 3 times using IP buffer, before the puriﬁed protein was eluted by the addition of IP elution buffer (Sigma Aldrich) and subsequently dialyzed against buffer D. In the case of co-immunoprecipitation analyses, the proteins were eluted by incubating with Laemmli sample buffer at 95  C prior to Western blot analyses.
Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad).
Western blot analyses  A total of 20 50 lg of soluble protein or eluates from immunopuriﬁcations were separated using SDS polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and incubated with blocking buffer (1  PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% skimmed milk) for 1 h at room temperature.
Blocked membranes were washed twice with PBS-T (1  PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for 5 min before incubation with a 1:2500 dilution of the primary antibody for 45 min at room temperature in PBS-T. Antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-HA (clone12CA5) antibody (Roche), mouse monoclonal anti- FLAG antibody (Sigma Aldrich), rabbit polyclonal anti-CBP antibody (Santa Cruz) and mouse polyclonal anti-RAR antibody (Millipore).
Membranes were washed three times with PBS-T at room temperature for 5 min and subsequently incubated with a horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti- mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma Aldrich) at a dilution of 1:5000 in blocking buffer for 45 min at room temperature.
After three washing steps of 5 min each with PBS-T at room temperature, detection of the signals was carried out using the ECL Plus Western Blotting Substrate (Pierce).
Glycosylase activity assays  Oligonucleotide primers used to generate 25-mer dsDNA con- taining either a central G:T or G:U mismatch basepair were as follows: 50-GAT AGG TTC CAC G(G)G TAC TCG AAG C-30 as the forward primer and 50-GCT TCG AGT AC(T/U) CGT GGA ACC TAT G-30 as the reverse primer (the nucleo- tides involved in the G:T(U) mismatches are written in brack- ets).
DNA nicking assays were performed as described previously [37] on this 25-mer dsDNA and a 25-mer dsRNA containing a central canonical G:C pair as a control.
Brieﬂy, oligonucleotides corresponding to the complementary strand were labeled on the primary amine modiﬁed 30-end with the AlexaFluorÒ 488 dye (Invitrogen) and oligonucleotide anneal- ing was performed by heating 1 mM solutions for 5 min at 100  C and cooling down the mixtures slowly to room temper- ature.
TDG proteins were incubated at 0.5 lM ﬁnal concentra- tions with dsDNA at 5 lM in 80 ll nicking buffer (25 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) at 37  C. 20 ll aliquots were withdrawn at different incubation time points.
DNA was precipitated in 70% ethanol solution con- taining 300 mM NaCl and then incubated with 0.01 N NaOH  for 30 min at 50  C. Oligonucleotides were separated by dena- turing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantiﬁed using a GeneGenius bioimaging system (SynGene, Ozyme).
Three independent replicates of glycosylase reactions were performed for each time point of the kinetic studies.
The enzymatic turnover was normalized by the amount of protein used, as detected by the Bradford assay.
Microscale thermophoresis  Microscale thermophoresis (MST) technique capitalizes from the fact that molecules move in a temperature gradient from hot to cold (thermophoresis).
This movement is impacted by complex formation, since molecules in a complex show an altered velocity.
MST technique is used to measure the thermophoresis of a ﬂuoresently labeled molecule (here YFP-CBP) subject to increasing concentrations of a binding partner (here immuno-puriﬁed TDG or TDG P65A).
To obtain a series of successively decreasing TDG concentrations, immuno-puriﬁed HA-TDG samples (or HA-TDG P65A) were diluted up to 14 times with buffer D (1:1, 1:4, 1:8, etc.).
The same amount of YFP-CBP containing cellular extract was added to each dilution in the presence or absence of immuno-puriﬁed FLAG-tagged RARa either in the presence or in the absence of RA.
The reaction conditions were set to 20 mM MgCl2.
MST experiments were conducted using a Monolith NT.115 (Nanotemper Technologies) as described previously [33,34] laser-on time 60 s, LED-power 30%).
(laser-power 20%,  Luciferase reporter assays  Cells were transfected with a mixture of plasmids containing 1 lg 17-mer b-globin-Luc, 50 ng pRL SV40, 50 ng Gal4- hRARa 1.5 lg pSG5-hTDGwt or pSG5-hTDG P65A and 1.5 lg pSG5 DNA in 50 ll total volume to which 12 ll of Exgen 500 (Fermentas) was added according to the manufac- turer s instructions.
After 6 h, the transfection reaction was stopped by adding 180 ll of DMEM to each well.
Then cells were treated with atRA at 5   10 7 M for 24 h. After incuba- tion, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 20 ll of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) at room temperature for 15 min before reading.
Luciferase activity was subsequently measured using GloMaxÒ-96 Microplate Luminometer (Promega) according to the manufacturer s instructions and normalized by protein amounts.
NMR studies  Full-length TDG wild-type and the mutant TDG P65A and their isolated N terminal domains for NMR studies were overexpressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain.
Protein expression and puriﬁcation were performed as described previously [37,38].
NMR experiments were performed at 293 K on a Bruker DMX 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe head.
All 1H spectra were calibrated with 1 mM sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-d(3,30,2,20)- propionate as a reference.
All 1H 15N HSQC spectra were recorded in an aqueous buffer composed of 100 mM NaiPO4 pH 6.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 5% D2O.
1H 15N   Le ger H et al / TDG:CBP:RAR in Transcription and Epigenomics  17  recorded on 100 lM samples of HSQC spectra were 15N-labeled proteins with 128 scans per increment and 128 dummy scans, 128 points in the nitrogen dimension and 1024 points in the proton dimension.
Total RNA preparation  Total RNA from transfected or non-transfected cells was pre- pared using the RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer.
Transcriptome analyses  Microarray analyses, RNA ampliﬁcation, labeling, hybridiza- tion and detection were performed following the protocols sup- plied by Applied Biosystems using the corresponding kits (Applied Biosystems).
The microarray data were extracted using the Bioconductor limma package [39] and median normalized.
Data quality was determined using a QC procedure [40].
Data were normalized using NeONORM with k = 0.02 [41 43].
Subtraction proﬁling was performed as described previously [44,45] using the CDS test [46].
Differentially expressed genes were classiﬁed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software to detect network- and pathway-enrichments.
Transcriptome data were deposited in the public database MACE (http://mace.
ihes.fr) using Accession Nos: 3167467256 (5-aza-dC treatment HEK293 cells), 2426124024 (RA treatment HEK293 cells), 2147989240 (CBP overexpression HEK293 cells), 2267526904 (RA treatment of TDG(TDGP65A)/CBP expressing HEK293 cells), cells), 2283559800 (RA treatment COS-7 cells), 2740738936 (CBP overexpression COS-7 cells), 2763807608 (RA treatment of TDG/CBP expressing HEK293 cells), 2549898104 (RA treatment of TDGP65A/CBP expressing HEK293 cells), 2901761912 (wild-type TDG overexpression in HEK293 cells) and 2890751864 (TDG P65A overexpression in HEK293 cells).
