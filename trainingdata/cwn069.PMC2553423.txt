In an effort
to identify novel endo-α-N-acetylgalact-
osaminidases (endo-α-GalNAcases), four potential genes
were cloned. Three of the expressed proteins EngEF from
Enterococcus faecalis, EngPA from Propionibacterium ac-
nes, and EngCP from Clostridium perfringens were puriﬁed
and characterized. Their substrate speciﬁcity was investi-
gated and compared to the commercially available endo-α-
GalNAcases from Streptococcus pneumoniae (EngSP) and
Alcaligenes sp. (EngAL). All enzymes were incubated with
various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and
the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay
and thin layer chromatography analysis. The Core 1 dis-
accharide Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP was the most rapidly hy-
drolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. EngEF exhib-
ited the highest kcat for this substrate. EngEF and EngPA
were also able to fully hydrolyze the Core 3 disaccharide
GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP. This is the ﬁrst report of endo-
α-GalNAcases EngEF and EngPA acting on Core 3 in ad-
dition to Core 1 O-glycans. Interestingly, there were no
signiﬁcant differences in transglycosylation activities when
Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP or GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP was
incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the
endo-α-GalNAcases tested in this work.

Introduction

Glycosylation is a common posttranslational modiﬁcation of
proteins. Glycans are implicated in a wide range of biologi-
cal events such as cell–cell interactions and recognition, in-
ﬂammation, and autoimmune diseases (Varki 1993; Ohtsubo
and Marth 2006). Detailed knowledge of the glycan structure
helps to correlate them to their respective function. To do so,
tools are required for highly sensitive analysis of glycan chains.
For structural analysis of asparagine-linked carbohydrates (N-
linked glycans), sugars are released from the protein backbone
by enzymes such as PNGase F (Tarentino and Plummer 1994).
The O-linked glycans are most commonly attached to serine or
threonine residues through the GalNAc residue at the reducing
end. Presently, there is no enzymatic way of releasing of O-
glycans intact. This is achieved by chemical methods, typically
by β-elimination with mild alkali (Kakehi et al. 1994) or mild

hydrazinolysis (Royle et al. 2002). These chemical methods
are limited because after this treatment the protein is no longer
functional.

Endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (endo-α-GalNAcase, EC
3.2.1.97) catalyzes the hydrolysis of an O-glycosidic α-
linkage between galactosyl β1,3 N-acetyl-D-galactosamine
(Galβ1,3GalNAc) and the serine or threonine residue in mucins
and mucin-type glycoproteins from various animal sources. This
O-linked disaccharide (Core 1 type O-glycan) is one of the
most abundant core structures found in mucin glycoproteins.
It is known as the Thomsen– Friedenreich antigen (T antigen)
immunodeterminant group and is used as a speciﬁc marker of
carcinoma (Varki 1993; Ohtsubo and Marth 2006).

Endo-α-GalNAcases have been puriﬁed from Clostridium
perfringens (Huang and Aminoff 1972), Streptococcus pneu-
moniae (Glasgow et al. 1977; Umemoto et al. 1977; Brooks and
Savage 1997), Alcaligenes sp. (Fan et al. 1990), Bacillus sp.
(Ashida et al. 2000), and Biﬁdobacterium longum (Fujita et al.
2005). All of these enzymes have a strict substrate speciﬁcity,
acting only on the α-linked disaccharide, Galβ1,3GalNAc. An
enzyme isolated from Streptomyces sp., has been reported to
release longer sugar chains than the disaccharide from porcine
mucin (Ishii-Karakasa et al. 1992, 1997) although further studies
are needed to conﬁrm this activity. These endo-α-GalNAcases
liberate O-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins without
damaging the protein backbone. This makes these enzymes pow-
erful tools for the investigation of the structure and function of
O-glycans.

The ﬁrst gene encoding endo-α-GalNAcase was isolated from
B. longum JCM1217 (engBF) (Fujita et al. 2005). In an effort to
identify endo-α-GalNAcases with broader substrate speciﬁcity
a BLAST search was done (Altschul et al. 1997) using the
EngBF protein sequence as a template. Four potential endo-α-
GalNAcases were selected from the BLAST results and their
genes were cloned; the expressed proteins were puriﬁed and
characterized. Two of these enzymes can release Core 1 and
Core 3 type O-glycans. This is the ﬁrst report of these enzymes
exhibiting this broader substrate speciﬁcity.

Results

Identiﬁcation and selection of the putative
endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases
In order to identify putative endo-α-GalNAcases, a BLAST
(Altschul et al. 1997) search was run using the endo-α-
GalNAcase protein sequence EngBF from B. longum JCM1217.
The top nine hits were from bacteria and had 28% and higher
overall sequence identity with EngBF (Figure 1). The pre-
dicted molecular mass of EngSP corresponds to that previously
characterized from S. pneumoniae (Brooks and Savage 1997;
Glasgow et al. 1977; Umemoto et al. 1977). All of the

(Pfam 08305); FIVAR, uncharacterized sugar-binding domain (Pfam 07554); F5-F8 type C, member of the galactose-binding domain-like superfamily (Pfam
00754). The protein accession numbers are B. longum (ABY836679), R. torques (ZP_01966813), B. capillosus (ZP_02035456), S. pneumoniae (YP_873926.1),
E. faecalis (NP_815498.1), Janibacter sp. (ZP_00993766.1), A. aurescens (YP_947239.1), S. coelicolor (NP_630440.1), P. acnes (YP_056270.1), and C.
perfrigens (YP_695137.1).

putative endo-α-GalNAcases had a centrally located conserved
region of 700–800 amino acid residues (Figure 1). Using the
Pfam database (Finn et al. 2006) to analyze the protein se-
quences, all sequences with the exception of EngEF from En-
terococcus faecalis contained predicted domains that are pre-
sumably involved with the identiﬁcation or binding of sugars
(sugar binding domain (SBD)). To determine if the existence
or the positioning of the SBDs could play a role on the sub-
strate speciﬁcity of this family of enzymes, it was decided
to clone and characterize four of these proteins each with a
different organization. EngEF has no predicted SBD. EngPA
from Propionibacterium acnes has an F5_F8 type C domain
(a member of the galactose-binding domain-like superfamily)
close to the N-terminus. EngAA from Arthrobacter aurescens
has two novel putative carbohydrate binding module (NPCBM)
domains at the C-terminus. EngCP from C. perfringens has a
CBM 4_9 domain (carbohydrate binding module) inside the
conserved region. All of the other potential endo-α-GalNacases
as well as the already characterized enzymes EngBF and EngSP
have SBDs at the C-terminus or inside the conserved region
(Figure 1).

Cloning end expression of the target endo-α-GalNAcase genes
Oligonucliotide primers (Table I) were designed to amplify the
genes engEF, engCP, and engAA from the genomic DNA of
E. faecalis ATCC 700802, C. perfringens ATCC 13124, and A.
aurescens TCI. Following polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the
ampliﬁed genes were cloned in frame into the pET21a expres-
sion vector. Unlike engEF and engCP, expression of engAA was
very low. The very weak endo-α-GalNAcase activity of EngAA
could be detected using Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP as a substrate
but only after an extended incubation. For this reason, EngAA
was dropped from this study. The gene coding the putative endo-
α-GalNAcase protein engPA from P. acnes could not be ampli-
ﬁed by PCR from the genomic DNA of P. acnes ATCC25746.
To clone the ORF coding for protein EngPA, it was necessary
to chemically synthesize the gene using codons optimized for
gene expression in Escherichia coli. Once synthesized the gene
was cloned into the expression vector pNEB206A. All three re-
combinant proteins were puriﬁed to apparent homogeneity by
the chromatographic steps described in the experimental pro-
cedures section. The puriﬁed proteins migrated as single bands
and the apparent molecular weights were in agreement with the

3GalNAcα1pNP). EngAL could only partially hydrolyze the
Core 3 disaccharide (27%) after 16 h of incubation (Table II).
EngAL could also partially release GalNAc while the rest of the
enzymes released only traces of the monosaccharide (Table II).
None of the enzymes could act on Galβ1,3GlcNAcα1pNP and
low or no activity was detected when Core 2 trisaccharide
(Galβ1,3(GlcNAcβ1,6)GalNAcα1pNP) was used as a substrate
(Table II).

The enzymes were also tested for their ability to release sugars
from natural glycoproteins. Calf κ-casein, human glycophorin
A, porcine mucin, calf fetuin, and calf asialofetuin were in-
cubated with different endo-α-GalNAcases. Based on the TLC
analysis, sugars were only released when asialofetuin and mucin
where used as substrates (Figure 3). Coincubating the substrates
with neuraminidase enabled the enzymes to release the core sug-
ars. The released sugars migrated at the same Rf on the TLC
plate as the Core 1 and 3 disaccharides (Figure 3). As expected
from the pNP data, when EngAL was incubated with mucin an
extra spot at the same Rf as GalNAc was observed (data not
shown).

The kcat of all enzymes was determined on Gal β1,3GalNAc-
α1pNP and GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP (Table III). When
Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP was used as a substrate EngEF exhibited
the highest kcat. EngPA had the lowest activity on that substrate
with a kcat about 25 times lower than EngEF. In the case of
GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP the kinetic parameters were deter-
mined only for EngPA and EngEF. Interestingly, EngPA had a
3-fold higher kcat than EngEF.

compared to the rest of the endo-α-GalNAcases which had very
low activity on this substrate (Table II), it was surprising to ﬁnd
no signiﬁcant difference in the amount of transglycosylation
products produced by all three enzymes when observed on a
TLC (Figure 4C).

Discussion

for

Transglycosylation activity
Several endoglycosidases have transglycosylation activity in
addition to hydrolysis activity. To test
this activity,
Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP was incubated with various 1-alkanols
in the presence of EngCP, EngEF, EngPA, EngSP, and EngAL.
Reaction products were analyzed on TLC plates (Figure 4). All
of the enzymes tested exhibited similar transglycosylation ac-
tivity. The longest 1-alkanol successfully incorporated in these
transglycosylation reactions was 1-pentanol though the level of
product was very low (Figure 4A and B). EngEF, EngPA, and
EngSP were also tested for transglycosylation activity using
the disaccharide GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP as the donor and
1-alkanols again as the acceptors. Since only EngEF and EngPA
were capable of fully hydrolyzing GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP

This is the ﬁrst report presenting data about the substrate speci-
ﬁcity of all available endo-α-GalNAcases. Three novel endo-
α-GalNAcases: EngEF from E. faecalis, EngPA from P. acnes,
and EngCP from C. perfringens have been cloned, puriﬁed, and
characterized. The commercially available endo-α-GalNAcases
from S. pneumoniae (EngSP) and Alcaligenes sp. (EngAL) have
also been tested. Data from a previous report on EngBF from B.
longum (Fujita et al. 2005) have also been included. All six of
these enzymes were able to completely hydrolyze Core 1 dis-
accharide Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP. None of them could act on
Galβ1,3GlcNAcα1pNP showing that there is a strict preference
for GalNAc as the sugar participating in the O-glycosidic link-
age. EngEF exhibited the highest kcat on Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP
while EngPA had the lowest.

EngEF and EngPA were the only enzymes

in this
study able to fully hydrolyze the Core 3 disaccharide
(GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP). EngAL could partially hydrolyze
it (Table II) while EngCP, EngSP, and EngBL had even lower
activity on this substrate (less than 6%). Interestingly, EngPA
was more active on the Core 3 substrate than EngEF contrary to
the results on the Core 1 disaccharide (Table III). A detailed mu-
tagenesis study will help in identifying the functional residues
responsible for the ability of EngEF and EngPA to act on Core
3 disaccharides.

Unfortunately, none of the enzymes could act on natural gly-
coproteins prior to treatment with neuraminidase. A major chal-
lenge would be to design an endo-α-GalNAcase that could act
on sialyated O-glycans.

All the enzymes were tested for their transglycosylation ac-
tivity. When the enzymes were incubated in the presence of
Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP and several 1-alkanols, we observed
no major differences in the amount of transglycosylation
products produced (Figure 4A and B). EngEF, EngPA, and
EngSP were also tested for transglycosylation activity us-
ing GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP as a donor. Interestingly, the
same transglycosylation activity proﬁle for these three en-
zymes was observed with this donor (Figure 4C) even though
only EngEF and EngPA are capable of fully hydrolyzing
GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP in contrast to EngSP which is sig-
niﬁcantly less active on this substrate.

After submission of this manuscript, a characterization of
EngBF from B. longum and EngCP from C. perfringens was
published (Ashida et al. 2008). Their results for the substrate
speciﬁcity of EngCP agreed closely with the substrate speciﬁcity
we had observed for EngCP.

In this study, three endo-α-GalNAcases were cloned, puri-
ﬁed, and characterized. This is the ﬁrst report of these endo-α-
GalNAcases EngEF and EngPA acting on Core 3 in addition to
Core 1 O-glycans. This property could make these enzymes a
powerful tool for the release of O-glycan sugars from glycopro-
teins. They can also be used as templates in future protein engi-
neering experiments toward the creation of endo-α-GalNAcases
capable of acting on O-linked glycans regardless of their sugar
composition.

Materials and methods

Cloning and expression of the endo-α-GalNAcase genes
Based on the DNA sequence of AAO81568 from E. faecalis,
YP_695137.1 from C. perfringens, and YP_947239.1 from
A. aurescens, oligonucleotide primer pairs EFfor-NdeI/EFrev-
XhoI, CPfor-NdeI/CPrev-XhoI, and AAfor-NdeI/AArev-HindIII
were designed (Table I). The putative endo-α-GalNAcase
genes were ampliﬁed by PCR using these primer pairs
from the genomic DNA of E. faecalis ATCC 700802, C.
perfringens ATCC 13124, and A. aurescens TC1, respec-
tively. The ampliﬁed genes (engEF, engCP, and engAA)
were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (New
England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA) and inserted into the cor-
responding sites of pET-21a (Novagen, Madison, WI). The re-
sulting plasmids (pET21a-engEF, pET21a-engCP, and pET21a-
engAA) were transformed into E. coli T7 Express lysY (New
England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA). The transformed cells
were grown overnight at 30
C in a 20 mL LB medium containing

100 µg/mL ampicillin. These transformations were used to
inoculate 1000 mL of fresh medium and antibiotics and grown
at 25
C. After these cultures reached an A600 of 0.6–0.7,
0.3 mM isopropyl thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added and
the cultures were shifted to 20
C. Incubation was continued for
12–14 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell
pellet was suspended in a ﬁnal volume of 15 mL of 20 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol. The
resuspended cells were sonicated for eight 20-s bursts at 50%
duty cycle using a Sonicator Ultrasonic processor model-375
(Misonix, Farmingdale, NY). Samples were subsequently cen-
trifuged and the supernatant was collected for further puriﬁca-
tion. All puriﬁcation steps were carried out at 4
C. All columns
used for protein puriﬁcation were purchased from GE Health-
care (Piscataway, NJ).

◦

Based on the DNA sequence of YP_056270.1 from P. ac-
nes, the putative endo-α-GalNAcase gene was chemically syn-
thesized. The codons were optimized for gene expression in
E. coli using DNAWorks software (Hoover and Lubkowski
2002). The optimized sequence was divided into six building
blocks and synthesized (Hoover and Lubkowski 2002). After
the sequence of each block was veriﬁed, the full sized gene
was assembled using the USER method (Bitinaite et al. 2007).
Once assembled the synthesized engPA gene was ampliﬁed by
PCR using the primer pair PAfor/PArev (Table I) and inserted
into the corresponding sites of pNEB206A using the USERTM
Friendly Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA)
(Bitinaite et al. 2007). The resulting plasmid pNEB206A-engPA
was transformed, expressed, and lysed as previously described
for other endo-α-GalNAcase genes.

EngEF puriﬁcation
The cell extract was diluted 3-fold with a buffer containing
20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6 (buffer A) and loaded onto a HiTrap
Q HP column that had been previously equilibrated in buffer
A. After the column was washed with ﬁve column volumes
of buffer A, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of
0–1 M NaCl in buffer A. Fractions with the enzyme eluted from
0.2 to 0.75 M NaCl. This was pooled and loaded onto a His-
Trap HP column previously equilibrated with buffer B (20 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl). After the column was washed
with ﬁve column volumes of buffer B, the enzyme was eluted
with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 M imidazole in buffer B. The
peak of enzyme activity eluted at an imidazole concentration
range of 0.06–0.27 M. These fractions were combined, dialyzed
overnight against buffer A, and loaded onto a Source 15Q col-
umn equilibrated in buffer A. After the column was washed with
ﬁve column volumes of buffer A, the proteins were eluted with
a linear gradient of 0.1–0.23 M NaCl in buffer A. Active EngEF
eluted from 0.14 to 0.18 M NaCl. These fractions were com-
bined and concentrated with a Centricon Concentrator 10 (Milli-
pore, Billerica, MA) to about 5 mL. Concentrated samples were
loaded onto a Superdex 75 column previously equilibrated with
buffer C (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mM NaCl) and washed
with buffer C. Fractions with EngEF activity were pooled and
concentrated. After the addition of glycerol at 50%, the puriﬁed
enzyme preparation was stored at −20
◦
C. Enzyme purity was
judged by gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under
denaturing conditions (Laemmli 1970). Protein concentration
was determined using Bradford’s dye binding assay (Bio-Rad,

D Koutsioulis et al.

Hercules, CA) (Bradford 1976). Highly puriﬁed bovine serum
albumin (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) was
used as the protein standard.

EngCP puriﬁcation
The cell extract was diluted 3-fold with buffer A and loaded
onto a Source 15Q column previously equilibrated in the same
buffer. After the column was washed with ﬁve column volumes
of buffer A, the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of
0–1 M NaCl in buffer A. The enzyme activity eluted from 0.3 to
0.45 M NaCl. These fractions were loaded onto a HisTrap HP
column previously equilibrated with buffer B. After the column
was washed with ﬁve column volumes of buffer B, the proteins
were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 M imidazole in buffer
B. The enzyme eluted from column at a concentration range
of 0.12–0.19 M imidazole. These fractions were combined,
dialyzed overnight against buffer D (20 mM sodium acetate,
pH 6.0), and subsequently loaded onto a Source 15S column pre-
viously equilibrated in buffer D. After the column was washed
with ﬁve column volumes of buffer D, the proteins were eluted
with a linear gradient of 0–1 M NaCl in buffer D. Active EngCP
fractions (eluting from 0.45 to 0.60 M NaCl) were combined and
concentrated with a Centricon Concentrator 10 (Millipore, Bil-
lerica, MA) to about 5 mL. Concentrated samples were loaded
onto a Superdex 75 column previously equilibrated with buffer
E (20 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 200 mM NaCl) and washed
with buffer E. Fractions with EngCP activity were pooled and
concentrated. After the addition of glycerol at 50%, the puriﬁed
enzyme preparation was stored at −20

EngPA puriﬁcation
The cell extract was diluted 3-fold with buffer A and loaded
onto a Source 15Q column previously equilibrated in the same
buffer. After the column was washed with ﬁve column volumes
of buffer A, the majority of the EngPA activity was detected
in the ﬂow through. This was dialyzed against buffer D and
loaded onto a Source 15S column previously equilibrated in
buffer D. The column was washed with ﬁve column volumes of
buffer D and EngPA activity was eluted with a linear gradient of
0–1 M NaCl in buffer D. Active EngPA fractions (eluting from
0.31 to 0.36 M NaCl) were combined, concentrated (5 mL), and
loaded onto a Superdex 75 column previously equilibrated with
buffer E. The column was washed with buffer E and fractions
with EngPA activity were pooled and concentrated. After the
addition of glycerol at 50%, puriﬁed enzyme preparation was
stored at −20

Assay of endo-α-GalNAcase activity
The hydrolytic activity of the enzymes was assayed using
Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP as a substrate. A 100 µL standard re-
action mixture contained a 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.25 mM substrate. The time-
dependent release of p-nitrophenol (pNP) at room temper-
ature was measured by reading the absorbance at 405 nm
using a 96-well plate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular De-
vices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Pure protein samples were used
for the kinetic measurements. Endo-α-GalNAcases from S.
pneumoniae (EngSP) and Alcaligenes sp. (EngAL) were pur-
chased from Roche (Basel, Switzerland) and Seikagaku Cor-
poration (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. The substrate speci-

804

ﬁcity was determined using various pNP glycosides and natu-
ral glycoproteins. The substrates Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP (CAS
59837-14-8), GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP (CAS 125455-64-
3), Galβ1,3GlcNAcα1pNP (CAS 57467-13-7), GalNAcα1pNP
(CAS 23646-68-6), calf κ-casein, human glycophorin A, porcine
mucin, calf fetuin, and calf asialofetuin were purchased from
Sigma. Galβ1,3(GlcNAcβ1,6)GalNAcα1pNP (CAS 139459-
55-5) was from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (North York,
Ontario). For TLC analysis, a Silica Gel 60 plate (Merck, White-
house Station, NJ) was developed in a solvent system of chlo-
roform/methanol/water, 3/3/1 (v/v/v), and the sugars were visu-
alized by spraying a diphenylamine/aniline/phosphate reagent
(Bailey and Bourne 1960).

Transglycosylation assays
The 15 µL transglycosylation reaction mixture contained a
50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM
GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP or 1.6 mM Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP
as donors, 0.8 µg of endo-α-GalNAcase and various 1-alcanols
as acceptors (13%, v/v). The reactions were incubated at room
temperature for 16 h. Methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol,
1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, and 1-nonalol
were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The transgly-
cosylation reaction mixtures were analyzed on a Silica Gel 60
TLC plate using chloroform/methanol/water 65/35/8 as the de-
veloping solvent and the sugars were visualized by spraying a
diphenylamine/aniline/phosphate reagent.

Optimum pH
The pH optimum for each enzyme was determined in a
pH range of 2.0–9.0 using the following buffers (50 mM):
glycine–HCl (2.0–4.0), sodium acetate (3.5–6.0), sodium phos-
phate (5.5–8.0), and Tris–HCl (7.0–9.0).

Enzyme kinetics
◦
Steady-state enzyme kinetics were performed at 25
C. The pro-
gram HYPER v 1.01 was used to determine Vmax and Km values.
The kcat values were calculated from Vmax using a molecular
mass of 188,000 Da for EngCP, 147,000 Da for EngEF, 142,000
Da for EngPA, 190,000 Da for EngSP, and 160,000 Da for En-
gAL. Reported values are the average of three measurements.
The standard deviations do not exceed 5%.
