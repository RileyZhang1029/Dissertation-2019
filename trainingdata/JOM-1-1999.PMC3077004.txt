In recent times the concept of infectious agents playing a role in cardiovascular disease has attracted much
attention. Chronic oral disease such as periodontitis, provides a plausible route for entry of bacteria to the
circulation. Upon entry to the circulation, the oral bacteria interact with platelets. It has been proposed that
their ability to induce platelet aggregation and support platelet adhesion is a critical step in the pathogenesis
of the infection process. Many published studies have demonstrated multiple mechanisms through which oral
bacteria are able to bind to and activate platelets. This paper will review the various mechanisms oral bacteria
use to interact with platelets.

The primary function of platelets is their adhesion

to endothelium or to matrix protein components
at sites of the injured vessel wall in the initiation of
haemostasis (1). However, platelets are poorly appre-
ciated for their involvement in inflammatory or immune
processes in host defence. In this regard, platelets share
many similarities with leukocytes well characterised for
their role in immuno-protection following invasion by
foreign invaders. Just like leukocytes, platelets undergo
chemotaxis (2), phagocytose foreign particles (3) and
secrete a multitude of products including inflammatory
mediators (4), cytokines (5) and antimicrobial peptides
(6). Indeed the concept of platelets playing a role in
immuno-protection is not a new theory. Studies by
Clawson and White in the 1970s demonstrated that
platelets were capable of recognising a foreign invader
(710). In doing so, platelets expressed a number of
highly adhesive membrane receptors capable of binding
injured or infected tissues. Following this, platelets
underwent many cytoskeletal rearrangements in the
form of extending pseudopodia that stretched around
the foreign invader which promoted engulfment, thus
clearing the foreign invader from the bloodstream (3).
Therefore, platelets may provide a bridge between innate
immunity and host defence.

The conventional role of platelets in thrombosis
Platelets are small anucleate cell fragments of the larger
haematopoietic precursor cell, the megakaryocyte (11).

Being devoid of a nucleus, the platelet has no control of
gene expression but has limited capabilities in translational
protein synthesis (5). The primary role of platelets in
haemostasis is to police the integrity of the endothelium to
prevent blood loss (12, 13). Platelets circulate close to the
endothelial cell surface as individual entities that ordinarily
do not interact with any other cell types and without any
stable interaction with endothelial cells as they exist in an
anti-adhesive state. Upon trauma or injury to the vascular
endothelium, platelets rapidly accumulate at the site of
injury. Recruitment is a highly controlled event that is
initiated by the adhesive interaction between the exposed
extracellular matrix proteins in damaged endothelium and
specific membrane receptors on the platelet. Adhesion to
the extracellular matrix requires a synergistic function of
several membrane receptors which ultimately results in
platelet activation and aggregation. There are several
different types of matrix proteins exposed upon vessel
injury including collagen, vonWillebrand factor (vWf),
fibronectin, laminin and thrombospondin. Other adhesive
proteins such as fibrinogen/fibrin and vitronectin are not
synthesised by endothelial cells, however, do bind to
exposed matrix proteins increasing adhesiveness at the
damaged site (14, 15).

The platelet expresses a number of membrane proteins
with specific binding capabilities for one or more of
these adhesive matrix proteins. The initial interaction of
platelets with the injured vessel wall occurs between GPIb
and immobilised vWf (16). This interaction initiates the

tethering of circulating platelets to the vessel wall.
Platelets typically ‘roll’ over the vWf in the direction of
flow driven by shear forces experienced by the vasculature
(1). A loss of interaction between GPIb and vWf on one
side of the platelet leads to the formation of another
GPIbvWf interaction on the other side of the platelet
which gives rise to a rolling phenomenon. Eventually
the platelet will come to a complete stop due to firm
adhesion to the injured part of the vessel. This firm
adhesion is typically mediated by several membrane
receptors, some of which will have become activated as
a result of platelet rolling. The adhesion to the extra-
cellular matrix proteins is a result of several platelet
receptor interactions; the collagen receptors a2b1 (1719)
and GPVI (20, 21), the fibronectin receptor a5b1 (22) and
the fibrinogen receptor GPIIb/IIIa (23). Once firmly
adhered, the platelets rearrange cytoskeletal components
which results in flattening or spreading of the platelet,
this is essential in order to withstand the shear forces
experienced in the vasculature (1).

At this stage, platelets undergo the release reaction
where they release the contents of its stored intracellular
granules. These granules contain proteins such as P-
selectin which mediates adhesion of platelets to mono-
cytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes, resulting in the
formation of platelet leukocyte complexes (2426). The
granules also contain many chemotactic agents which lead
to the recruitment of various inflammatory cells; platelet
derived growth factor (PDGF) and 12-hydroxyeicosate-
traenoic acid (12-HETE) which recruit neutrophils (27,
28); platelet factor 4 and platelet derived histamine
releasing factor (PDHRF) which recruit eosinophils in
airway disease (29, 30); PDGF and transforming growth
factor b (TGF-b) which recruit monocytes and macro-
phages and TGF-b which recruits fibroblasts (3133).
Platelet granules also contain several mediators of tissue
damage such as oxygen-free radicals and hydrolytic
enzymes. Platelets also release cationic proteins that
initiate vascular permeability and mediators that enhance
aggregate formation such as adenosine diphosphate
(ADP), serotonin (5-HT), Thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and
platelet activating factor (PAF; 34,35). More recently it
has been shown that platelet granules contain many
antimicrobial peptides such as beta-lysin, platelet micro-
bial protein (PMP), neutrophil activating peptide (NAP-
2), released upon activation normal T-cell expressed and
secreted (RANTES) and fibrinopeptides A and B (3640).
The flattened part of the platelet forms a new surface
for additional platelets to adhere, predominantly through
GPIIb/IIIa crosslinking adjacent platelets through a
fibrinogen bridge, resulting in aggregate formation. The
final step sees an effective plug at the site of injury that is
reinforced by the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin
through the coagulation cascade (14).

Role of platelets in infection
As well as their established role in haemostasis, there is
growing evidence for a role for platelets in immunology.
In fact it would appear that platelets have an important
role to play in the response to infection. Clinical studies
would suggest that serious infection is associated with
thrombotic events (41, 42). Recent use of antibiotics was
shown to be associated with myocardial infarction (43),
although treatment of patients with myocardial infarction
with antibiotics provided no benefit (44).

The oral bacterial burden has been shown to be
associated with the extent of atherosclerosis (45, 46)
and cardiovascular disease (47). Periodontal disease is
also associated with ischaemic stroke (48, 49) and oral
pathogens are also strongly associated with infective
endocarditis (50).

Mechanisms of plateletbacterial interactions

While it is clear that the increased oral bacteria burden is
key in the increased risk of thrombotic events, it is not
clear if this is due to increased inflammation leading
to endothelial dysfunction (51) or is it due directly to the
bacteria triggering thrombosis; however, as bacteria can
trigger platelet activation, it is likely that this may play a
role in triggering the thrombotic events (52).

Direct interaction
Bacteria can have proteins that can directly interact with
a surface receptor on the platelet (Fig. 1). In this case they
have ligand-mimetic domains that act as agonists on the
platelet receptor. One such direct interaction is that with
Streptococcus sanguinis which can directly interact with
glycoprotein Iba (GPIba),
receptor on
the platelet (66). Other potential mediators of platelet
activation are lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic
acid (LTA). LPS has been shown to activate platelets in a
TLR4-dependent process (5355), however, some studies
have failed to see this platelet activation (56).

the vWf

Indirect interaction (bridging protein)
One of the more common mechanisms for interacting with
the platelet is the use of a bridging protein (Fig. 1). In this
case bacteria bind a plasma protein that is a natural ligand
for a platelet receptor e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, which
has multiple mechanisms for interacting with platelets
using a bridging ligand. Clumping factor A and B (57) and
fibronectin binding protein (58) on S. aureus can both bind
fibronectin and/or fibrinogen both of which are ligands for
GPIIb/IIIa on the platelet. Helicobacter pylori can bind
vWf which interacts with GPIba on the platelet (59). The
most common bridging molecule for bacteria to use is
IgG. IgG bound to the bacterial surface can interact with
the platelet FcgRIIa receptor and while it appears that
this alone cannot stimulate platelet activation it acts in
conjunction with other bridging molecules (52, 59, 60). In

Fig. 1. Direct interaction: bacteria express proteins that interact directly with a platelet surface receptor. In this case, they have
ligand-mimetic domain that act as agonist on the platelet receptor. Indirect interaction: bacteria bind a plasma protein that acts
as a bridge and is a natural ligand for a platelet receptor. Secreted products: bacteria also have the potential to secrete products
that can in turn directly activate platelets.

the absence of a second bridging, molecule bound anti-
body can trigger complement
formation which can
mediate platelet activation via complement receptors in
conjunction with the FcgRIIa receptor (6062).

Indirect interaction (secretion)
Bacteria also have the potential to secrete products that
can in turn activate platelets (Fig. 1). Porphyromonas
gingivalis secretes gingipain, an enzyme that activates the
thrombin receptor on platelets which leads to platelet
activation (63) and Escherichia coli shiga toxin is asso-
ciated with platelet activation (64) via a novel platelet
glycosphingolipid (65).

Bacterial-induced platelet aggregation is different in
some respects to that seen with other platelet agonists.
Bacterial-induced aggregation is an all-or-nothing re-
sponse, in that no matter what concentration of bacteria
are added to a platelet preparation, the extent of aggrega-
tion will always be maximal (often less than that seen with
other agonists) or else there is no aggregation. Unlike
other agonists there is a lag time to aggregation. Adjusting
the concentration of bacteria shortens the lag time to a
minimum, but never eliminates it. There appears to be two
categories of bacteria: those that have a short lag time
of around 25 mins, e.g. S. aureus and those with a long
lag time of 1520 mins, e.g. S. sanguinis or Streptococcus
gordonii. The short lag time usually indicates the presence
of a direct interaction and is dependent on the levels
of expression of the interacting protein on the bacterial
surface (60). The long lag time usually indicates a
complement-dependent aggregation process.

The interaction of platelets with bacteria is not simply
one of activation as bacteria are able to either support
platelet adhesion or induce platelet aggregation and these
are distinct phenomena involving different bacterial
proteins. The adhesion process can occur under static

conditions or shear conditions and different proteins are
often involved in each process (66).

Interaction of oral bacteria with platelets
Oral bacteria differ greatly in their ability to interact with
platelets. Kerrigan and colleagues have proposed several
different phenotypes for platelet interaction (67, 68).
They identified strains of oral bacteria that support
platelet adhesion and induce platelet aggregation with a
short lag time (S. sanguinis strain 13379) [(67), strains of
bacteria that support platelet adhesion and induce
platelet aggregation with a long lag time (S. gordonii
strain DL1), strains that support platelet adhesion but
do not induce platelet aggregation (S. gordonii strain
Blackburn, S. sanguinis strain B5.7), strains that cannot
support platelet adhesion but can induce platelet aggre-
gation with a short lag time (S. gordonii strain Sk12),
strains that cannot support platelet adhesion but can
induce platelet aggregation with a long lag time (S.
gordonii strain M99 and S. sanguinis strain 7863) and
finally strains that cannot support platelet adhesion or
induce platelet aggregation (S. gordonii strain M5 and S.
sanguinis strain SK96) (68).

Several

studies have now demonstrated that

the
platelet bacterial interaction may be a lot more complex
than this model suggests. It appears that several bacteria
have evolved in such a way that many interactions occur
at the same time to mediate the same response. For
example, it has been shown that S. gordonii uses three
distinct interactions with the platelet to induce platelet
aggregation, deletion of one protein interaction does not
affect the aggregation, however, deletion of all three
interactive proteins ablates the response. Furthermore,
platelets exist in an environment where they are exposed
to a range of shear stress. Several studies have char-
acterised the interaction between platelet GPIba and

vWf under high shear or between platelet GPIIb/IIIa
and fibrinogen under low shear.

in the rat model of

Other studies suggest that the virulence of several
strains of S. gordonii
infective
endocarditis does not correlate with their ability to just
interact with platelets. Several strains of S. gordonii that
were shown to interact with platelets were resistant to
polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte-dependent killing
(69). These results suggest that the ability of S. gordonii to
survive in PMN’s following phagocytosis may be another
important virulence determinant to consider. Therefore,
studying the interaction between bacteria, platelets and
PMN’s is essential to get a more physiological represen-
tation of the real picture.

The interaction between streptococci and
platelets
At sites of trauma in the oral cavity, streptococci can gain
access to the bloodstream and interact with circulating
platelets (70). Septic thrombi (oral streptococci encased
in activated platelets) can be found at several sites in the
circulatory system, for example, on heart valves, endo-
cardium or indeed in atherosclerotic plaques.

Several approaches have been used to identify the factor
responsible for inducing thrombus or aggregate formation
(Table 1). Early studies demonstrated that bacteria can
either secrete products capable of activating platelets or
bind directly to platelets to induce an intracellular signal,
either way the outcome is the same  aggregate formation.
S. sanguinis was the first oral bacteria shown to have
the capability to induce platelet aggregation and to
support platelet adhesion (67, 71, 72). S. sanguinis-induced
platelet aggregation appeared to be dependent on calcium
and fibrinogen and in some cases non-specific antibody,
whereas platelet adhesion to S. sanguinis occurred inde-
pendently of calcium, fibrinogen or non-specific antibody.
This led to the initial classification of the response, a class 1
component-mediated adhesion to the platelet, a class 2
component mediates a calcium-dependent activation and
a class 3 component amplifies the response.

Early studies identified components of S. sanguinis
thought to play a role in binding to and activating
platelets. Platelet-associated activating protein (PAAP)
was first identified in 1990 (73). PAAP is a 115 kDa
glycoprotein, which contains a collagen-like epitope and
is constitutively expressed on the surface of S. sanguinis
(74, 75). PAAP is possibly environmentally regulated
during infection in response to high temperature (fever)
or exposed collagen (exposed on damaged heart valves)
(70). Partial sequence alignment shows homology to the
heat shock family of proteins of Myobacterium tubercu-
losis and E. coli (76). PAAP interacts with an unknown
platelet receptor which is capable of transducing an
intracellular signal leading to platelet activation. Several
attempts that have been made to identify the platelet

receptor and potential candidates include the integrin a2b1
(77) or an integrin-associated protein of 175 kDa (78). As
not all donors respond to S. sanguinis, it was reported that
the ability of PAAP to induce platelet aggregation may be
donor specific (79). Platelets release several mediators
from stored granules when they become activated of which
includes ATP. S. sanguinis has been shown to have
ectoATPase activity and is capable of hydrolysing ATP
to ADP (80, 81). There are several ADP receptors
expressed on the platelets, therefore the conversion of
ATP to ADP may serve as an amplification step essential
for platelet aggregate formation.

Further classification of

the streptococcal-induced
aggregation response has been described by Kerrigan
et al. Type 1 streptococci induce platelet aggregation with
a short lag time (B5 mins), type 2 streptococcus induce
platelet aggregation with a long lag time (1015 mins) and
finally type 3 streptococci fail to induce platelet aggrega-
tion (20 mins). S. sanguinis strain 13379 is an example
of type 1 streptococcus and interacts with platelets via
platelet receptor glycoprotein Iba (the vWf receptor) (67).
S. sanguinis binds to the N-terminal portion of GPIba
between amino acids 1 and 282. Platelets from patients
with Bernard Soulier Syndrome (patients who fail to
express GPIba on the surface of their platelets) fail to
interact with S. sanguinis (67). S. sanguinis lysates were
passed through a GPIba affinity column in order to
identify the S. sanguinis protein binding to GPIba (77).
This led to the identification of a serine-rich glycoprotein
called serine-rich protein A (SrpA). Deletion of SrpA
failed to have any effect on the percent platelet aggrega-
tion, however, significantly prolonged the lag time.
Furthermore, deletion of SrpA from S. sanguinis sig-
nificantly reduced its ability to support platelet adhesion
(82). These results highlight
the
interactions between S. sanguinis and platelets as multiple
proteins must be involved in supporting platelet adhesion
and inducing platelet aggregation.

the complexity of

S. sanguinis strain NCTC 7863 is an example of a
type 2 streptococcus. Ford et al. demonstrated that
S. sanguinis strain NCTC 7863 induced aggregation of
normal platelets suspended in plasma, removal of plasma
protein abolished aggregation (62). The long lag time of
S. sanguinis strain 7863 was progressively shortened by
incubating the bacteria in plasma for increasing lengths
of time prior to addition to platelets. Since the lag
time was due to addition of plasma rather than donor
platelets, it was suggested that the rate limiting step for
platelet aggregation was assembly or binding of plasma
factors on the bacterial cell surface. Subsequent experi-
ments demonstrated that complement assembly on the
surface of the bacteria was necessary for aggregation
of platelets. Further experiments demonstrated that
complement assembly was not enough to trigger platelet
aggregation which led to the discovery that IgG and

fibrinogen was necessary to complete the aggregation
process (61). More recently, McNicol and colleagues
demonstrated that depletion of S. sanguinis-specific
antibodies from plasma prevented platelet aggregation
(83). Addition of antibodies led to rapid phosphorylation
of the platelet antibody receptor, FcgRIIa, occurred
following S. sanguinis binding (84).

S. gordonii is a distinct but close relative of S. sanguinis
and has been extensively examined for its interactions
with platelets. Platelet binding to S. gordonii is predomi-
nantly mediated by the cell surface glycoprotein, glyco-
sylated streptococcal protein B (GspB). This is a large
protein of over 3,000 amino acids and has a predicted
molecular weight of 286 kDa. It is heavily glycosylated,
primarily with glucose and glucosamine in the cytoplasm
and is transported to the cell surface via an accessory
system comprising of the SecA2 and SecY2 proteins (85,
86). Sequence alignment demonstrates that GspB is a
member of a highly glycosylated serine-rich family of
proteins which include S. gordonii haemaglutinin strepto-
coccal antigen (Hsa) (87, 88), S. sanguinis SrpA (82) and
Streptococcus parasanguinis fimbria associated protein 1
(FAP1) (89). Hsa is a GspB homologue of S. gordonii that
was originally characterised as a sialic acid binding
haemaglutinin (90). Like GspB, Hsa has also been shown
to bind to GPIba on human platelets (91). Interestingly,
even though both GspB and Hsa bind sialic acid residues
on the platelet GPIba, there are subtle differences in the
binding specificities. For example, GspB specifically binds
O-linked sialic residues and the membrane proximal
mucin-rich core of GPIba (92), whereas Hsa specifically
binds N-linked sialic residues on GPIba (92) and GPIIb/
IIIa (91). Similar to the effect seen using the S. sanguinis
SrpA mutant, deletion of either GspB or Hsa from
S. gordonii had no effect on platelet aggregation, however,
significantly reduced platelet adhesion (68). Thus, other
factors are most likely involved in supporting platelet
adhesion and inducing platelet aggregation.

Possibly the best characterised streptococcal adhesins
are those of the antigen I/II family of proteins. Initially
identified in Streptococcus mutants, antigens I/II have now
been detected on most oral streptococcal species (93). In
S. gordonii,
the antigen I/II polypeptides have been
designated SspA (172 kDa) and SspB (164 kDa). These
polypeptides are oligospecific adhesins recognising multi-
ple ligands such as collagen type 1 (94), beta 1 integrins
(93), salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (gp-340; 95), as
well as several other bacteria including P. gingivalis,
Candida albicans and Actinomyces naeslundii (9698).
Using a proteomic approach to identify differential cell
wall protein expression between an aggregating strain
of S. gordonii (DL1) and a non-aggregating strain of
S. gordonii (Blackburn), Kerrigan and colleagues identi-
fied SspA and SspB as proteins differentially expressed
(68). Deletion of SspA and SspB from S. gordonii DL1

Plateletoral bacteria interactions

induced platelet aggregation and supported platelet adhe-
sion as normal. However, deletion of SspA and SspB along
with Hsa abolished platelet aggregation and reduced
platelet adhesion by 50%, similar to the Hsa mutant alone.
Furthermore, overexpression of SspA and SspB in the
non-platelet reactive surrogate host Lactococcus lactis,
induced platelet aggregation but failed to support platelet
adhesion (68). These results suggest that S. gordonii-
induced platelet aggregation is a multifactorial event
mediated by several surface proteins.

the local

fluid environment of

A major limitation in our current understanding in
plateletbacterial interactions stems from the fact that all
of the previous studies have been carried out under static
conditions. It has been argued in the literature that data
obtained in vitro using static binding assays may not be
relevant to the fluid dynamic environment encountered
in the vasculature (99). There are a growing number of
papers in the literature in the last number of years
suggesting that
the
circulation critically affects the molecular pathways of
cellcell interactions (100, 101). Platelets perfused over
immobilised S. sanguinis or S. gordonii interacted with a
typical rolling behaviour followed by firm adhesion.
Deletion of SrpA or Hsa abolished this rolling behaviour,
suggesting that these proteins are essential for the initial
contact of platelets with the bacteria (68, 82). Platelet
rolling with subsequent firm adhesion is characteristic
of the platelet interaction with vWf and collagen at the
site of injury. Typically, platelets roll along immobilised
vWf under high shear conditions. The high shear is
necessary to induce a conformational change in vWf
thereby making it recognisable by its corresponding
receptor on platelets, GPIba. As platelets roll along
immobilised S. gordonii or S. sanguinis under low shear
conditions,
it suggests that the bacterial proteins in-
volved, Hsa or SrpA, are in a conformation already
recognisable by platelet GPIba and possibly mediate
the initial
interaction leading to thrombus formation.
Furthermore, deletion of Hsa from S. gordonii reduced
thrombus formation in a catheterised rat model of
infective endocarditis (102). The S. sanguinis or S.
gordonii protein that mediates firm adhesion has yet to
be identified.

Streptococcus mitis is less well characterised in its
interaction with platelets. In 2001, Bensing et al. described
two surface expressed proteins that were involved in
binding platelets namely, PblA (107 kDa) and PblB (121
kDa; 103,104). The genes encoding these proteins reside
in the temperate bacteriophage SM1, a member of the
siphoviridae family. PblA and PblB are unusual because
neither of the protein expresses homology to any other
bacterial adhesins described, however, do resemble struc-
tural components of bacteriophages (104, 105). Typically,
PblA and PblB are released from S. mitis are then capable
of binding to the bacterial cell wall via the choline

residues. Once presented on the cell wall they are capable
of mediating platelet binding and also enhance activation
of platelet aggregation. Deletion of PblA or PblB reduced
thrombus formation in an animal model of infective
endocarditis,
these proteins
may be important for platelet deposition onto the infected
valve (105).

therefore suggesting that

S. mutans has been shown to induce platelet aggregation
and support adhesion of human platelets via a soluble
serotype-specific rhamnoseglucose polymer (106). This is
a direct interaction with the platelets as S. mutans induced
aggregation in a plasma-free environment in a rapid and
saturable manner. Rhamnose polymers are also found in
other glycopeptides such as ristocetin. Ristocetin is used to
induce agglutination of platelets. The mechanism for
ristocetin-induced agglutination involves the binding and
bridging of the vWF to platelet GPIba. Cleavage of the
rhamnose tetrasaccharide of ristocetin abolished its ability
to induce platelet aggregation in plasma. This suggests that
the polymer rhamnose plays an important role in platelet
aggregation. Furthermore, depletion of the rhamnose
glucose polymers from the cell wall of S. mutans, aggrega-
tion was reduced down to 50% of the level of the wild-type
strain. These results suggest that the rhamnose backbone
play an essential role in inducing platelet aggregation (106).
Streptococcus oralis and S. parasanguinis do support
platelet adhesion, however, not as efficiently as S. gordonii
or S. sanguinis (107, 108). S. oralis and S. parasanguinis
express a protein homologous to the highly glycosylated
serine-rich family of proteins, similar to S. gordonii Hsa
and S. sanguis SrpA (109). The lack of efficient adherence
to platelets may be due to the absence of the sialic
acid-binding moieties necessary to interact with platelet
GPIba. Alternatively the protein may not be readily
accessible on the cell surface, for example, if it is blocked

6

by other surface structures such as a capsule (109). Some
strains of S. oralis and S. parasanguinis did induce platelet
aggregation, however, the mechanisms involved have not
been elucidated.

The interaction between other oral bacteria and
platelets
P. gingivalis contains small vesicles on the outside of their
surface that have been shown to interact with many host
cells. These vesicles contain factors that have cytotoxic,
haemagglutinin, proteolytic and platelet activating activ-
ities. Pham et al.
identified that gingipain-R was the
factor responsible for inducing platelet aggregation (110).
Lourbakos et al. reported that two forms of purified
gingipain-R (50 kDa RgpB and a 95 kDa RgpA) caused
aggregation of human platelets with efficiency similar to
thrombin through the activation of protease-activated
receptors 1 and 4 (PAR1 and PAR4; 63). Naito and
colleagues demonstrated that P. gingivalis-induced plate-
let aggregation depends on HagA-encoding genes that
intragenically code for adhesins such as Hgp44 (111).
Hgp44 adhesin on the bacterial cell surface is processed
from haemagglutinin A by the Rgp and Kgp proteinases.
Specific antibodies against P. gingivalis binds to the
platelet antibody receptor FcgRIIa is also thought to
be an essential step leading to platelet aggregation. Cross-
reacting antibodies recognising platelet GPIba prevented
platelet aggregation, suggesting that P. gingivalis may be
binding to GPIba. More recent studies investigated the
ultrastructural properties of P. gingivalis-induced platelet
aggregation (112). This study demonstrated that platelets
have the ability to engulf or phagocytose P. gingivalis
during or after platelet activation thereby removing the
bacteria from the circulation.

Clinical implications
It
is clear that oral bacteria especially Streptococci
spp. and P. gingivalis are capable of triggering platelet
activation. Thrombus formation plays a critical role in
infective endocarditis, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarc-
tion and stroke, all of which have been associated with
periodontal disease. Thus, it is likely that inflammation in
the oral cavity allows oral bacteria to access the circula-
tion. Once in the blood, they interact with platelets
forming plateletbacterial aggregates, which can bind to
heart valves or interact with sites of atherosclerosis. In the
case of a high level of infection, it can lead to septicaemia
with systemic activation of platelets, which are cleared
from the circulation leading to thrombocytopenia. Re-
ducing bacterial load in the mouth is an important step to
preventing thrombus formation, as lesser bacteria will
be available to enter the circulation. Several strategies
have been employed to address this in the form of oral
healthcare programmes. However, in more severe cases
root canal or tooth extraction may be more appropriate.
Conventional therapy focuses on the use of antibiotics
to treat overt infection and as prophylaxis for patients at
high risk, such as patients with damaged or replacement
cardiac valves undergoing dental procedures. However,
the increase in the incidence of antibiotic resistant strains
of bacteria has made it more difficult to treat these
infections. The latest guidelines from American Heart
Association no longer recommend the prophylactic use of
antibiotics except in those patients with very high risk of
complications (113).

Targeting the plateletbacterial interaction may also
play an important role in the treatment and prevention
of the serious complications of infection. Thus, if the
interaction between streptococci and platelets could be
prevented, the thrombotic complications of infection could
be reduced. While septicaemia may still occur, it would
prevent the formation of infected thrombi on the cardiac
valve and the formation of septic emboli. It would also
prevent the thrombocytopenia associated with sepsis.

There are two approaches to targeting the bacteria
platelet interaction: blocking the bacterial protein or the
platelet receptor. The difficulty with blocking the bacter-
ial proteins is that there are so many different proteins
involved as each bacterial species uses a different protein
and some use three or four different proteins. Targeting
the platelet may be a more effective approach as all of the
bacteria that activate platelets do so by interacting with
three platelet receptors: GPIb, GPIIb/IIIa and FcgRIIa.
The FcgRIIa receptor is a very promising target as recent
reports in the literature suggest that FcgRIIa acts as a
co-signalling receptor for platelet membrane receptors.
These reports demonstrate that inhibition of FcgRIIa
blocks downstream signal events upon engagement of
either GPIIb/IIIa or GPIba (114) thus preventing platelet
activation. An added advantage is that unlike inhibition

Plateletoral bacteria interactions

of GPIba or GPIIb/IIIa, inhibition of FcgRIIa does not
affect normal platelet function. As a result there is a lot
of interest in developing small molecule inhibitors of
FcgRIIa. However, as the Fcg receptor is a crucial player
in leukocyte activation in the immune system, small
molecule inhibitors may adversely affect the immune
function of these cells. In vivo experiments will address
this caveat.

When oral bacteria gain entry to the circulation as well
as coming into contact with platelets, they also come into
contact with polymorphonucleocytes such as neutrophils
and monocytes. Recent studies have demonstrated that
platelets and monocytes from patients with periodontitis
are more sensitive to activation with oral bacteria over
control patients (115). In addition, platelet complexes
with neutrophils and monocytes bound more oral
bacteria than uncomplexed neutrophils or monocytes
(51). The net result of these platelet leukocyte complexes
is cellular priming with increased release of inflammatory
mediators and unwanted accelerated thrombosis at sites
of vascular injury.
