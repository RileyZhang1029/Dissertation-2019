In Theorem 1  if  should be replaced by  iff  and should read as follows: For odd k, an RC complete sequence s achieves the lower bound (Proposition 1) iff there exist two edge-disjoint paths with no repeating edges, corresponding to s and RC(s), that together cover all edges of the de Bruijn graph of order k  1.
In Algorithm 1  although  should be replaced by  while , and  should read as follows:  1.
Initially all edges are unmarked, F ¼ R ¼  ,  and A ¼ fug, an arbitrary vertex.
