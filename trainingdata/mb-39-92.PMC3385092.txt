Lignosus  rhinocerus  is  a  macrofungus  that  belongs  to  Polyporaceae  and  is  native  to  tropical  regions.  This  highly  priced  mush-
room  has  been  used  as  folk  medicine  to  treat diseases  by  indigenous  people.  As  a  preliminary  study  to  develop  a  culture
method  for  edible  mushrooms,  the  cultural  characteristics  of  L.  rhinocerus  were  investigated  in  a  range  of  culture  media  under
different  environmental  conditions.  Mycelial  growth  of  this  mushroom  was  compared  on  culture  media  composed  of  various
carbon  and  nitrogen  sources  in  addition  to  C/N  ratios.  The  optimal  conditions  for  mycelial  growth  were  30oC  at  pH  6  and
7.  Rapid  mycelial  growth  of  L.  rhinocerus  was  observed  on  glucose-peptone  and  yeast  extract  peptone  dextrose  media.  Carbon
and  nitrogen  sources  promoting  mycelial  growth  of  L.  rhinocerus  were  glucose  and  potassium  nitrate,  respectively.  The  opti-
mum  C/N  ratio  was  approximately  10 : 1  using  2%  glucose  supplemented  as  a  carbon  source  in  the  basal  media.

Tiger’s  milk  mushroom  (Lignosus  spp.)  is  a  tropical  mac-
rofungus that inhabits soil and belongs to Polyporaceae in
the  phylum  Basidiomycota.  The  genus  Lignosus  com-
prises  six  species,  including  L.  dimiticus,  L.  ekombitii,  L.
goetzii,  L.  rhinocerus,  and  L.  sacer  [1].  L.  hainanensis  was
recently  added  when  it  was  discovered  in  the  province
of Hainan, southern China [2].

In  Malaysia,  Tiger’s  milk  mushroom  (Lignosus  rhinoc-
erus) is the most popular and specifically sought after medic-
inal  mushroom  by  the  Semai  aborigines  upon  request  by
urban middlemen [3]. Besides being used as tonic to maintain
health,  Tiger’s  milk  mushroom  is  also  used  to  treat  asthma,
breast cancer, cough, fever, food poisoning, and wounds.

L.  rhinocerus  is  collected  occasionally  from  remote
regions  in  the  states  of  Pahang  and  Perak.  However,
the supply of fruiting bodies and tubers of this mushroom
is  insufficient  for  local  demand.  Additionally,  information
on  the  culture  methods  of  L.  rhinocerus  are  scarce  and
no  documentation  for  the  cultural  conditions  are  avail-
able.  Hence,  we  obtained  fundamental  cultural  condition
information  to  maximize  L.  rhinocerus  mycelial  growth
in  a  preliminary  study  to  develop  an  artificial  culture
method.

Materials  and  Methods

Collection  and  isolation  of  L.  rhinocerus. The  fruiting
bodies  and  tubers  of  L.  rhinocerus  were  collected  in  the
state  of  Pahang,  Malaysia  in  June  2009.  To  obtain  a  pure
L.  rhinocerus  culture,  surface  sterilized  small  pieces  of
pileus,  stipe,  and  tuber  were  transferred  to  potato  dextrose
agar  (PDA)  supplemented  with  streptomycin  (200 µg/L)
and  incubated  in  the  dark  for  15  days  at  25oC  to  be  used
as  an  inoculum.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  experiments
were performed with four replications.

Culture conditions for L. rhinocerus mycelial growth.
pH: To  screen  the  pH  values  necessary  for  favorable
growth  of  L.  rhinocerus,  a  5 mm  diameter  plug  of  inocu-
lum  was  removed  with  a  cork  borer  from  10-day-old  cul-
tures of L. rhinocerus grown on PDA, placed in the center
of PDA adjusted to a pH range of 4~9 with 1 N NaOH or
HCl,  and  incubated  in  the  dark  for  10  days  at  25oC.
Mycelial  growth  was  measured  according  to  the  method
described by Shim et al. [4].
Temperature: To  screen  the  temperature  values  neces-
sary  for  favorable  growth  of  L.  rhinocerus,  the  fungus

was  incubated  for  10  days  at  five  different  temperatures.
A  5  mm  diameter  plug  of  inoculum  was  removed  with  a
cork borer from 10-day-old cultures of L. rhinocerus grown
on  PDA,  placed  in  the  center  of  PDA  adjusted  to  pH  6,
and  incubated  in  the  dark  for  10  days  at  15,  20,  25,  30,
and 35oC. Mycelial growth was measured according to the
method described by Shim et al. [4].
Culture  media: Seven  different  culture  media  were
prepared and screened to identify the best culture media
to  grow  L.  rhinocerus  mycelia  (Table  1).  The  culture
media  were  adjusted  to  pH  6  before  sterilization,  steril-
ized  for  15 min  at  1,210oC,  and  aseptically  poured  into
a  plate.  A  5 mm  diameter  plug  of  inoculum  was  removed
from  10-day-old  L.  rhinocerus  cultures  grown  on  PDA,
placed in the center of each agar plate containing one of
the  seven  different  culture  media,  and  incubated  in  the
dark  for  10  days  at  25oC.  After  the  10  day  incubation,
L.  rhinocerus  mycelial  growth  and  density  were  meas-
ured.

Effect of nutrient source.
Carbon sources: To  screen for the carbon  sources  favor-
able  for  L.  rhinocerus  mycelial  growth,  experiments  were
performed using basal media supplemented with eight dif-
ferent  carbon  sources  (fructose,  galactose,  glucose,  lac-
tose,  maltose,  mannose,  sorbitol,  and  sucrose).  The  basal
medium  was  composed  of  peptone,  5 g;  MgSO4,  0.05 g;
KH2PO4, 0.46 g; K2HPO4, 1.0 g; thiamine-HCl, 120 µg; agar,
20 g;  and  distilled  water,  1,000 mL.  Each  carbon  source
was  added  to  the  basal  medium  at  0.1 M  per  1,000 mL
and  mixed  thoroughly  [4].  The  basal  medium  was
adjusted  to  pH  6  before  sterilization,  sterilized  for  15 min
at  121oC,  and  aseptically  poured  into  a  plate.  A  5 mm
diameter  plug  of  inoculum  was  removed  from  10-day-old
L.  rhinocerus  cultures  grown  on  PDA,  placed  in  the  cen-

ter  of  basal  media  containing  one  of  eight  carbon  sources
and  incubated  in  the  dark  for  10  days  at  25oC.  After  10
days,  L.  rhinocerus  mycelial  growth  and  density  of  were
measured.
Nitrogen  sources: To  screen  nitrogen  source  favorable
for  L.  rhinocerus  mycelial  growth,  the  basal  medium  [5]
was  supplemented  ten  different  nitrogen  sources  (aspar-
agines,  alanine,  ammonium  acetate,  ammonium  nitrate,
glutamic  acid,  glutamine,  glycine,  phenylalanine,  potas-
sium  nitrate,  and  urea).  In  addition,  D-glucose  was  added
to  the  basal  media  at  2%  (w/v)  and  used  as  the  carbon
source  for  expediting  mycelial  growth.  Each  nitrogen
source  was  added  to  the  basal  media  at  0.02 M  [4].  The
basal  media  containing  each  nitrogen  source  was  adjusted
to pH 6 before sterilization, sterilized for 15 min at 121oC,
and aseptically poured into a plate. A 5 mm diameter plug
of  inoculum  was  placed  in  the  center  of  basal  media  con-
taining  each  nitrogen  source  and  incubated  in  the  dark  for
10  days  at  25oC.  After  the  10  day  incubation,  mycelial
growth and density were measured.
C/N ratio: Mycelial growth was measured in basal media
that  were  mixed  with  1,  2,  3,  and  4%  glucose  (w/v)  as  a
carbon  source  and  then  mixed  continually  with  NaNO3  as
the  nitrogen  source.  The  C/N  ratio  (NaNO3 : D-glucose)
was  adjusted  to  10 : 1,  20 : 1,  30 : 1,  and  40 : 1  in  each
media [4]. These media were adjusted to pH 6 before ster-
ilization, sterilized for 15 min at 121oC, aseptically poured
into  a  plate,  and  inoculated  with  a  5 cm  diameter  inocu-
lum  plug.  The  plates  were  incubated  in  the  dark  for  10
days at 25oC, and diameter was measured.

Statistical  analysis. All  data  were  analyzed  with  a  one-
way analysis of variance using Minitab® 15.1.1.0 (www.file-
crop.com/minitab-15.1.1.0.html).  A  p-value < 0.05  was
considered significant.

5~7.  The  optimum  pH  for  radial  growth  of  L.  rhinocerus
mycelia  was  pH  6  and  7  (Fig.  1).  However,  the  statistical
analysis  indicated  no  significant  differences  in  mycelial
growth  between  pH  6  and  7.  Mycelial  growth  of  L.  rhi-
nocerus  was  suppressed  proportionally  with  an  increase
and  decrease  in  pH.  These  results  agreed  with  the  opti-
mum pH condition for Agrocybe cylindracea growth [6].

The  temperature  suitable  for  good  L.  rhinocerus  myce-
lial growth was 30oC (Fig. 2), which was significantly higher
than  growth  obtained  at  the  other  temperatures  (p < 0.05).
Growth was suppressed at temperatures > 30oC. This find-
ing  was  in  agreement  with  that  of  Sung  et  al.  [5]  who
reported  that  Pleurotus  ostreatus  yielded  its  highest  growth
at  30oC.  In  addition,  the  current  results  also  corroborates
those  of  Shim  et  al.  [7],  in  which  mycelial  growth  of
Macrolepiota procera gradually increased in proportion to

was suppressed at 35oC.

Screening of culture media. Seven different culture media
were  prepared  to  screen  for  the  one  most  suitable  for  L.
rhinocerus mycelial growth (Table 1). Mycelial growth and
density  of  L.  rhinocerus  were  optimum  in  glucose-pep-
tone  and  yeast  extract  peptone  dextrose  (YEPD),  followed
by mushroom complete medium (MCM) media (Table 2).
However, no significant difference was observed in myce-
lial  growth  between  glucose-peptone  and  YEPD  media.
Hennerberg  media  was  the  most  unfavorable  for  radial
growth of this fungus.

Effect of favorable nutrient sources.
Carbon  and  nitrogen  sources: The  carbon  and  nitro-
gen  sources  suitable  for  promoting  mycelial  growth  of  L.
rhinocerus  were  glucose  and  potassium  nitrate,  respec-
tively (Tables 3 and 4). Of the eight carbon sources tested,
glucose  yielded  a  significantly  larger  colony  diameter  of
69.3 mm but a somewhat compact mycelial density. Addi-
tionally,  fructose  and  mannose  also  recorded  a  high  radial
mycelial  growth  rate.  The  combination  of  these  three  car-
bon  sources  indicates  that  L.  rhinocerus  prefers  monosac-
charides.

Among the ten nitrogen sources tested, potassium nitrate
yielded  the  largest  colony  diameter  of  27.4 mm  with  a
somewhat  thin  mycelial  density,  followed  by  alanine  and
phenylalanine. These findings suggest that potassium nitrate
and  alanine  and  phenylalanine  were  effective  for  promoting
mycelial growth, although growth was not significantly dif-

ferent  among  these  nitrogen  sources.  These  results  are
similar  to  those  of  Kim  et  al.  [8]  who  found  that  alanine
promotes mycelial growth of microfungi.

C/N  ratio. The  culture  media  that  was  mixed  with  2%
glucose  as  the  carbon  source  and  then  adjusted  to  a  C/N
ratio  of  10 : 1,  showed  the  most  favorable  mycelial  growth
(Table  5).  Generally,  a  gradual  rise  in  glucose  concentra-
tion  seemed  to  suppress  mycelial  growth  of  L.  rhinoc-
erus.  Notably,  no  growth  occurred  at  a  40 : 1  C/N  ratio.
These  results  are  consistent  with  those  of  Shim  et  al.  [4]
who  found  that  excessive  glucose  concentrations  sup-
pressed mycelial growth on culture media.
