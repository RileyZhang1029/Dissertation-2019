Abstract
Interest in epigenetics is now booming in all the biomedical fields. Initially, interest was sparked within
the field of cancer research with the finding of global DNA hypomethylation events in the 1980s,
followed by the CpG island hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in the 1990s and the
approval of DNA demethylating drugs and histone deactylase inhibitors in the 2000s. For
transformed cells, the arena is also expanding to include the wide spectrum of histone modification
changes and the interaction with noncoding RNAs. What lies ahead is even more exciting, with the
imminent completion of many human cancer epigenomes that will
form the basis of better
biomarkers and epigenetic drugs.

Epigenetic changes in cancer
Much of the current hype in epigenetics stems from the
recognition of its role in human cancer. Yet, intriguingly,
the first epigenetic change in human tumors—global
genomic DNA hypomethylation—was reported way
back in the early 1980s, at about the same time the
first genetic mutation in an oncogene was discovered [1].
So why the delay in recognizing the importance of
epigenetics in cancer?

In the 1980s, epigenetics was a fledgling discipline,
hampered by methodological limitations, while genetic
knowledge of cancer was expanding exponentially. By the
mid-1990s, however, classical tumor suppressor genes,
such as p16INK4a, hMLH1, and VHL [2], were shown to
undergo a specific epigenetic hit (the inactivation of gene
expression by CpG island hypermethylation), resulting in a
major acceleration in the field. We now know that so-called
epigenetic changes explain many hallmark features of
malignant disease: these genes are deregulated not at the
DNA level but at the complexly packaged chromatin level,
which ultimately results in cell dysfunction.

Epigenetics may be important for the cancer field, but
what does the term really mean? Truth be told, it has

many definitions, which have changed over the years as
our knowledge has changed. Researchers studying this
discipline recognize how bewildering such a nebulous
term can be to nonexperts, and they get together from
time to time to put forward better explanations and
nomenclatures, but
they usually come up empty-
handed, or with recommendations that people do not
remember. Thus, we have to go back to the classics.
Waddington defined epigenetics in 1939 as “the
causal interactions between genes and their products,
which bring the phenotype into being” [3]. Adrian
Bird redefined the term as “the structural adaptation
of chromosomal regions so as to register, signal or
perpetuate altered activity states” [4]. I prefer a more
concrete definition: the inheritance of patterns of DNA
and RNA activity that do not depend on the naked
nucleotide sequence. By “inheritance,” I mean a memory
of such activity transmitted from one cell generation to
the next (through mitosis), or from one organismal
generation to the next during meiosis. Meiotic inheri-
tance is perhaps more provocative, as there is still scant
direct evidence of epigenetic inheritance from one
generation to the next in humans, but more abundant
and robust data do exist in plants [5] and even mice [6].
However, genomic imprinting is a good example in

humans: when it goes awry it can lead to diseases such as
Prader-Willi syndrome.

Epigenetics today is not a purely speculative subject, as it
was in Waddington’s time; it is based on a rapidly
growing understanding of the chemical modifications
that our genome and its regulatory proteins (the
components of chromatin) undergo to control
its
functions. There are many modes of epigenetic control,
including nucleosome positioning and noncoding-RNA–
mediated regulation of gene expression (such as micro-
RNAs). Nucleosome positioning refers to the constraints
nucleosomes put on the DNA wrapped around their
histone core, often affecting the accessibility of transcrip-
tion factors and hence their ability to transcribe a gene.
The best-studied epigenetic marks, however, are DNA
methylation and histone modifications.

In humans, DNA methylation typically occurs at the
cytosine base of DNA, within CpG dinucleotides. What is
interesting is the existence of CpG-rich regions—“CpG
0
islands”—that are associated with the 5
-end regulatory
regions of almost all housekeeping genes as well as with
half of tissue-specific genes. When these promoter CpG
islands are methylated, the associated genes tend to be
transcriptionally inactive. Indeed, the correct expression
of many tissue-specific, germline-specific, imprinted, and
X chromosome –inactivated (in females) genes, as well as
that of repetitive genomic sequences, relies largely on
DNA methylation.

the N-terminal

The other critical epigenetic marks are chemical
modifications of
tails of histone
proteins. Histones, once considered mere DNA-packa-
ging proteins, regulate the underlying DNA sequences
through complex post-translational modifications
such as lysine acetylation, arginine and lysine methy-
lation, or serine phosphorylation. It has been pro-
posed that distinct combinations of modifications
presented on histone tails form a “histone code” that
regulates gene activity. This has prompted vigorous
debate, with dissenters arguing that patterns of histone
modification cannot really constitute a “code” that
adheres to hard and fast rules, as in the case of the
triplet codon rule that
translates transcribed DNA
sequences into protein. Nonetheless, for many epige-
netic researchers this is a helpful perspective in trying
to make sense of
the numerous combinations of
histone tail modifications.

A central question in epigenetics is how one genotype
can give rise to different phenotypes. In an individual,
it is clear that all tissues have the same genome, yet
activity varies vastly from cell to cell. We now know

that this is largely because the right epigenetic marks
instruct specialized programs that distinguish,
for
example, a retinal cell from a myocyte, a T lymphocyte,
or a skin epithelial cell sharing the same DNA
sequence. Thus, defects in cloned animals could be
explained by our inability to replicate exactly the
epigenetic program that steered the course of develop-
ment in the donor individual. Similarly, defects in
babies conceived by in vitro fertilization could be
attributable to imprinting variations leading to
imprinted disorders. DNA methylation and histone
modifications even may explain the different pene-
trance of diseases displayed in monozygotic twins, as
first reported in one of our papers [7]. This work has
occasionally prompted inquiries from police or law-
yers, asking whether we can assist in differentiating one
identical twin from his or her sibling in court cases.

An epigenetic mutant-mouse strain illustrates how even
diet can alter phenotype via an epigenetic mechanism:
a DNA methylation variant mouse (agouti strain)
changes fur color depending on the levels of methyl
donors obtained through its diet, and the trait
is
heritable to the next generation [8]. These discoveries
actually restore some credibility to Lamarck’s discredited
hypothesis of the inheritance of acquired traits, which
has long been regarded as the antithesis of neo-
Darwinian genetic theory.

Many cancer scientists have gotten aboard the epigenetic
bandwagon since new, user-friendly PCR- and sequen-
cing-based technologies have been developed. The list of
tumor suppressor genes shown to undergo epigenetic
inactivation has consequently grown long in the last few
years. And in addition to the candidate-gene approach,
array-based techniques have also detected on the order of
300 epigenetically modified genes in cancers, using
expression arrays combined with DNA demethylating
treatments or direct DNA methylation microarrays [9]
(Figure 1).

Epigenetic disruption of the “dark genome”—the 90%
of our genome that does not code for messenger RNA
and proteins—is a very exciting finding that looks to
be extremely relevant in cancer etiology. MicroRNAs
with growth-inhibitory functions, such as miR-124a
and miR-34b/c, undergo epigenetic inactivation
because the sequences surrounding their respective
transcription start sites become hypermethylated
[10,11]. Overall,
the emerging picture shows that
distinctive cancer-associated patterns of CpG island
hypermethylation are tumor type-specific and con-
tribute decisively to the origin and development of
human cancer.

Besides providing a better understanding of cancer at
the molecular level, what hope does epigenetics bring
to applied cancer research? Table 1 provides examples
in this area. Epigenetics has already revealed useful
diagnostic biomarkers (GSTP1 in prostate cancer) and
prognostic biomarkers. This has been an eye-opener for
oncologists and hematologists, as transformed cells
with specific hypermethylation patterns on certain
genes have turned out to be reliable biomarkers for
particular types and stages of cancer. The best example
is the aberrant DNA methylation of
the gene that
encodes glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP1), almost
exclusively observed in prostate cancer, which seems to
be a valuable biomarker for indicating the disease and
a malignant transformation prognosis in older males
with high levels of prostate-specific antigen. The fact
that these epigenetic markers can be detected in all
types of biological
in a
background of many normal cells makes them very
promising tools for disease screening and monitoring.
With the advent of genome-wide methodologies,
researchers are currently working on typing whole
aberrant DNA methylation fingerprints. Such expres-
sion microarray signatures could, in the future, serve as
potential prognostic tools, which could indicate time to
progression or overall survival. This research is being
done in breast cancer; however, clinical application is
still years away.

fluids and biopsies [12]

Another invaluable use of epigenetic markers is in the
prediction of responses to particular chemotherapy
agents. The proof of principle was provided by the
DNA repair enzyme MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase), which, when the gene’s promoter
region was hypermethylated at its CpG island, predicted
that treatment with alkylating agents such as carmustine
or temozolomide in gliomas would generate a good
therapeutic response [13]. This is because MGMT repairs
the lesions caused by these drugs, and if the enzyme is
not
the DNA damage is
permanent and the cell dies.

there, as in cancer cells,

Potential treatment strategies for breast cancer in carriers
of mutated BRCA1, the classical tumor suppressor gene,
have been boosted by pharmacoepigenetics—the study
of epigenetic variants that affect the response to drug
therapies. The population of mutated BRCA1 carriers is
low; thus, the discovery that BRCA1 can exist as an
epimutant when hypermethylated has increased the
pool of individuals affected by this high-risk, cancer-
causing aberration. This is accelerating the development
of the use of PARP (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase)
inhibitors, known to have a good response in BRCA1
tumors [14].

In particular,

Histone modification patterns are also altered in human
tumors.
levels of histone H4 lysine
20 trimethylation (H4K20me3) and histone H4 lysine
16 monoacetylation (H4K16ac) are severely disturbed in
cancer cells [15] both globally and at particular loci.
Comparing absolute results between laboratories,
however,
is proving troublesome, since the central
technique—chromatin immunoprecipitation—has more
interindividual and interlaboratory variation than the
usual DNA methylation assays, and depends largely on the
quality of the antibodies used. Thus the community is not
yet at a stage where it can use altered histone modification
profiles found in cancer as biomarkers. Researchers are,
however,
finding an increasing number of histone
modifier genes disrupted in many cancers, opening the
door to small-molecule drug development
targeted
against aberrant histone modifiers. This is particularly
applicable to hematological malignancies and sarcomas,
in which translocations that generate fusion proteins
involving histone methyltransferases and histone acetyl-
transferases are common [16]. The approach is also
relevant for the gene amplification of histone demethy-
lases in solid tumors.

A strong selling point for epigenetic cancer research is
the fact
that epigenetically inactivated genes can
conceivably be reactivated with the right drugs, while
genetic changes are irreversible. To date, a few

pharmacological compounds directed toward epigenetic
enzymes have shown promise in treating leukemias and
lymphoma. These include DNA demethylating agents
(5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2
-deoxycytidine) and histone
deacetylase inhibitors (i.e., suberoyl anilide bishydrox-
amide [SAHA] [17]). Although their exact antitumor
mechanism has not been completely elucidated, most
of them cause programmed cell death and, at current
doses, show limited toxicity in patients. The translation
of these advances in hematological malignancies to
solid tumors is slow, and it will be critical for ongoing
studies to identify markers of good response to
epigenetic drugs. New compounds continue to be
developed in preclinical research, targeting other his-
tone modifiers, such as the class of histone deacetylases
called sirtuins. Researchers are on the lookout for more
specific DNA demethylating agents that do not change
normal DNA methylation.

Cancer epigenetics is an exciting field as we continue to
discover new types of epigenetic marks and levels of
epigenetic control. Recent examples include the newly
discovered 5-hydroxymethylcytosine modification; the
chemical modification of RNA; the existence of impor-
tant regulatory regions outside the minimal promoter,
such as CpG island shores and enhancers; the role of
chromatin remodeling factors that move nucleosomes
around using ATP; and, most importantly, the epigenetic
layers present
in the noncoding RNA genome. The
widespread use of high-throughput technologies will in
a short time, I am sure, produce comprehensive cancer
epigenomes to study and employ in the better manage-
ment of oncology patients. Glimpses can already be seen
in the publication of, for example, small-epigenome
characterization [18] and whole-genome DNA methyla-
tion analyses [19].
