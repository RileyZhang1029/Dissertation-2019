Identifying the binding sites of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) remains one of the most fundamental and important chal- lenges to the studies of such interactions.
Capturing RNA and RBPs via chemical crosslinking allows stringent puriﬁcation procedures that signiﬁcantly remove the non-speciﬁc RNA and protein interactions.
Two major types of chemical crosslinking strategies have been developed to date, i.e., UV-enabled crosslinking and enzymatic mechanism-based covalent capture.
In this review, we com- pare such strategies and their current applications, with an emphasis on the technologies themselves rather than the biology that has been revealed.
We hope such methods could beneﬁt broader audi- ence and also urge for the development of new methods to study RNA RBP interactions.

Among many strategies that have been developed, mapping RNA protein interactions on a genomic scale (thus often cou- pled with high-throughput analyses) represents one great exam- ple.
In the initial attempts to identify RNAs that are bound by speciﬁc RBPs, RNA immunoprecipitation was combined with microarray analysis (RIP-ChIP) [1,2].
However, these methods are limited to stable ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), which are prone to contamination of indirect or non-physiological interactions [3].
In order to achieve high speciﬁcity (and also res- olution), methods that allow covalent capture of RNA protein interactions in vivo have been developed.
In the following sec- tions, we will describe these novel methods for mapping the binding sites of RBPs on a genome-wide scale.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2014.03.001   Li X et al / Crosslinking RNA-protein Interactions Genome-wide  73  Panoramic views of protein RNA interactions enabled by UV crosslinking  CLIP and HITS-CLIP  UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) is a mile- stone technology invented by the Darnell Laboratory in 2003 (Figure 1) [4].
Back in the 1980s, it was reported that UV light induces covalent crosslinks between proteins and RNAs, with- out causing crosslinks between proteins [5,6].
CLIP makes use of short wave UV irradiation at 254 nm to induce the formation of covalent crosslinks only at sites of direct contact between pro- teins and RNAs, in the context of whole tissues, organisms or individual cell types.
After UV irradiation, cells are lysed and the cross-linked RNA RBP is ﬁrst treated with RNase to trim the RNA size to about 60 100 nucleotides in length.
Since the protein RNA complex is covalently linked, stringent conditions can be applied during immunoprecipitation to purify the pro- tein RNA complexes.
Such immunoprecipitation procedure is generally enabled with antibodies against the proteins of interest or protein epitope tags.
Subsequently, the protein RNA com- plexes are separated on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE), and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane fol- lowed by proteinase K treatment.
Such step also helps to remove contamination caused by the antibody or during immunopre- cipitation step.
The RNA molecules recovered are then 50 and 30 ligated, allowing PCR ampliﬁcation of the target RNA from RNPs of interest.
This original CLIP protocol was ﬁrst applied to identify Nova RNA targets in the brain by the Darnell group [4].
Nova is a neuron-speciﬁc RBP, which regulates neuronal RNA splic- ing.
In 2005, Darnell and colleagues optimized the original CLIP protocol and further improved the speciﬁcity of the method.
In the current CLIP protocol, the 30 RNA linker ligation step is done on-bead [7].
There are three advantages conferred by this modiﬁcation.
First, free 30-linkers can be removed during SDS PAGE, so that it can prevent the liga- tion of 50-linker and 30-linker, self-ligation, circularization of target RNA and the ligation of bacterial rRNA that may come from the commercial RNA ligase or proteinase K. Therefore, signal-to-noise ratio can be greatly improved.
Second, there is no need to separate free RNAs on urea PAGE, which is a necessary step to separate linker linker ligation from previous CLIP protocol.
Third, the usage of high concentration of RNA linkers can be avoided, which alleviates the aforemen- tioned self-ligation problem as well.
In 2008, a new modiﬁca- tion to CLIP, high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP), was adopted to harness the power of next-generation sequencing (NGS).
Thus, HITS-CLIP has made it highly feasible to obtain genome-wide protein RNA interactions.
HITS-CLIP was ﬁrst applied to study Nova RNA interactions and uncovered the 3  end RNA processing rules in the brain [8].
Control experiments are key components in every tech- nique, and CLIP or HITS-CLIP is no exception.
There are two essential controls in CLIP or HITS-CLIP.
First, to verify that UV light has indeed caused covalent crosslinks between proteins and RNA, a non-UV treated sample should be used for in which no RNA should be detected.
Second, the antibody that recognizes the protein of interest must be speciﬁc.
Therefore, it is very necessary to  immunoprecipitation,  run a control without antibody, or a control with knockout cell or tissue, and do a mock IP experiment.
reported to regulate processing of  Apart from Nova, the RNA targets of several RBPs have been successfully identiﬁed by CLIP or HITS-CLIP in vari- ous biological systems.
For example, with the help of the CLIP method, hnRNP A1, a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, is shown to be required for processing of miR-18a [9] and SF2/ASF, a prototype member of the SR protein family, was speciﬁc mRNAs with the help of CLIP [10].
CLIP was also used to study the function of the RNA-binding protein Rrm4, discov- ering that Rrm4 may transport RNAs from the nucleus to cell poles [11].
Additionally, HITS-CLIP was also applied to study other RBPs, such as Argonaute in mouse brain [12], polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB, also known as hnRNP I) in HeLa cells [13], FOX2 in human embryonic stem cells [14] and so on.
Nonetheless, HITS-CLIP and CLIP methods discussed above cannot achieve individual-nucleotide resolution of the binding site.
In 2011, it was reported that the cross-linked nucleotide could be deleted or mutated during reverse tran- scription [15,16].
Therefore, through the analysis of deletion or mutation in sequencing reads, HITS-CLIP can identify exact crosslink sites and achieve individual-nucleotide resolu- tion of the binding site (Figure 1) [15,16].
In summary, CLIP and HITS-CLIP are very useful tech- niques to study protein RNA interactions, which can be applied to different biological samples such as bacteria, fungi, yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, mammalian tissue including brain, and culture cells including human embryonic stem cells and HeLa cells.
PAR-CLIP  ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP  It was estimated that in CLIP or HITS-CLIP, the maximal crosslinking efﬁciency ranges from 1% to 5% with puriﬁed protein and radiolabeled RNA [17].
To improve the cross- linking efﬁciency, photoactive nucleoside analogues, 4-thio- uridine (4-SU) and 6-thioguanosine (6-SG), and hence photoactivatable (PAR- CLIP) were used by Tuschl and colleagues [18].
In PAR- CLIP, 4-SU and 6-SG are added to the growth medium, which are then taken up by cells and eventually incorpo- rated into newly-synthesized RNA molecules without obvi- ous toxicity.
The formation of covalent crosslinks between proteins and RNAs is performed under UV irradiation at 365 nm, instead of UV 254 nm used in CLIP.
The following steps are similar to CLIP protocol, including RNase treat- ment, recovery of RNA fragment, reverse transcription and sequencing.
immunoprecipitation,  It is noteworthy that the incorporated 4-SU can lead to T to C transition in the sequenced cDNA.
Therefore, it is pos- sible to identify crosslink sites at individual-nucleotide resolu- tion by analyzing the mutations in cDNA sequences (Figure 1).
The accuracy of PAR-CLIP has been veriﬁed by identifying the RNA targets of several RBPs in recent years.
At the very beginning, Thomas Tuschl and colleagues selected several intensely-studied RBPs and microRNA-con- taining RNP complexes (miRNPs), including pumilio homo- logue 2 (PUM2), quaking (QKI), insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding proteins 1 3 (IGF2BP1 3), the Argonaute proteins (AGO) and trinucleotide repeat-containing proteins   74  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 72 78  Figure 1 Outline of HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP and several variants, iCLIP, iCLAP and CRAC High-throughput sequencing CLIP (HITS-CLIP) and individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP (iCLIP) are in the left panels  individual- nucleotide resolution crosslinking afﬁnity puriﬁcation (iCLAP) and crosslinking and cDNA analysis (CRAC) are in the middle panels  photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) is in the right panel.
PAR-CLIP uses thioribonucleosides and UV at 365 nm to form the complex of RNA and RNA-binding protein (RBP), while the other four methods utilize UV at 254 nm.
Isolation of RNA RBP complexes is achieved either by immunoprecipitation (IP) (PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and iCLIP) or by double afﬁnity puriﬁcation (iCLAP and CRAC).
iCLAP and CRAC use immobilized metal ion afﬁnity chromatography (IMAC) under denaturing conditions as a secondary puriﬁcation.
To achieve individual-nucleotide resolution, HITS-CLIP utilizes deletion or mutation during reverse transcription, iCLIP and iCLAP take advantage of truncated cDNAs, and PAR-CLIP makes use of thymidine (T) to cytidine (C) transition in cDNA.

6 (TNRC6A C) in HEK293 cells, to identify the binding sites [18].
One year later, transcriptome-wide binding sites of the RBP defective germline development protein 1 (GLD-1) in C. elegans [19], RNA targets of the RNA-binding  protein HuR [16,20,21], the binding targets of the sequence- speciﬁc RBP complex Nrd1 and Nab3 in yeast [22] and the binding motif of PAP-associated domain-containing 5 (PAPD5) [23] were also identiﬁed using PAR-CLIP.
Li X et al / Crosslinking RNA-protein Interactions Genome-wide  75  In addition, PAR-CLIP is particularly suitable for studies using cultured cells, because of its high uptake efﬁciency of nucleoside analogues (incorporation efﬁciency is up to 4% for 4-SU in relative to uridine [18]).
In short, the PAR-CLIP method has higher cross-linking efﬁciency and can also achieve individual-nucleotide resolution of the binding sites.
CLIP-derived methods  In the case of the protein Nova, 85% of cDNAs are truncated, because reverse transcriptase stops at the UV-induced cross- link site, in which peptides may not be removed by proteinase K [24].
However, every coin has two sides.
Individual-nucleo- tide resolution CLIP (iCLIP), a variation of CLIP, was devel- oped by the Ule laboratory, which made use of this experimental observation to identify crosslinked sites [25].
In iCLIP protocol, co-immunoprecipitated RNA is ligated to a 30 adaptor, followed by proteinase K treatment, resulting in a covalently-bound peptide on the RNA.
Using primers con- taining two cleavable adaptor regions and one random bar- code, cDNA will be truncated at crosslink site during reverse transcription.
Subsequently, cDNA is circularized, linearized, ampliﬁed and sequenced.
Thus, it is easy to ﬁnd out the residue next to the crosslink site, which ideally should be the ﬁrst nucleotide after the barcoded sequence (Figure 1).
iCLIP was ﬁrst applied to study the function of hnRNP in splicing [25].
Subsequently, this technique was used to identify the RNA tar- gets of the T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1 (TIA1), TIA-like 1 (TIAL1) [26] and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) [27].
Crosslinking and afﬁnity puriﬁcation (iCLAP), a method to purify streptavidin/histidine (Strep/His) double-tagged RBP using stringent afﬁnity puriﬁcation instead of immunoprecipi- tation, is a variation of iCLIP (Figure 1).
In the case of TIA1 and TIAL1, the TIA1 antibody has a slight cross-reactivity during afﬁnity puriﬁcation to TIAL1 [26].
Therefore, it is necessary to use RBP with a tag at the N- or C-terminus to co-purify the RNP complex, under the conditions of poor anti- bodies.
In the iCLAP technique, Jernej Ule and colleagues, who invented the iCLIP method, used magnetic streptavidin beads in the ﬁrst puriﬁcation step followed by cobalt beads under denaturing conditions as a secondary puriﬁcation step [26].
Subsequently, cDNAs are ampliﬁed and sequenced in the similar way as using iCLIP.
to iCLIP,  (Figure 1).
Similar  Another variation of CLIP is the crosslinking and cDNA analysis (CRAC), where RBPs are tagged with C-terminal 6   His, tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site and protein A tags immunoglobulin G (IgG) beads are used in the ﬁrst puriﬁcation step.
The RNA protein complexes were subsequently treated with TEV protease, followed by immobilized metal-ion afﬁnity chromatography (IMAC) as a secondary puriﬁcation.
Using the CRAC method, the Tollervey laboratory identiﬁed the binding sites of the probable pre-mRNA-splicing factor ATP-dependent RNA helicase Prp43 [28] and the small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs) Nop1, Nop56, Nop58 and rRNA processing 9 (Rrp9) [29] in yeast.
In summary, as CLIP variants, iCLIP, iCLAP and CRAC are similar to HITS-CLIP and PAR-CLIP in essence.
All methods can achieve single nucleotide resolution and produce data with high precision.
Crosslinking to identify RNA-bound proteome  RBPs play diverse roles in many biological processes and inﬂu- ence the RNA metabolism [30].
Many RBPs have canonical RNA binding domains, including the RNA recognition motif (RRM), heterogeneous nuclear RNP K-homology domain (KH), zinc ﬁnger (Znf), etc.
[31].
Based on such observation, the mammalian genome has been predicted to encode about 600 RBPs [32].
However, researchers also have reported that there are quite a few RBPs that do not contain such canonical RNA-binding domains [23,33].
Therefore, mere computational predictions will likely miss these non-canonical RBPs.
Two types of experiments can be performed in order to identify an RBP.
The ﬁrst one takes advantage of protein arrays, which were spotted with tagged recombinant proteins.
In fact, two groups have identiﬁed about 200 RBPs in yeast via protein arrays [34,35].
The other one utilizes RNA pull-down methods, in which RNA of interest is immobilized and then used to pull out potential RBPs from (very often) cell lysates via afﬁnity.
Combining the use of an RNA tag and high-reso- lution quantitative mass spectrometry (MS), interacting part- ners for RNA motifs of general interest can be detected [36].
For instance, by hybridizing with afﬁnity-tagged oligodT, mRNA-binding proteome can be studied [37].
Nonetheless, these methods cannot discriminate direct RNA protein inter- actions from indirect ones.
two groups  independently reported a new approach to study the mRNA interactome.
In the ﬁrst step of their methods, they use UV light to covalently crosslink RNA and RBPs.
The UV light can only crosslink protein bound to RNA directly but does not affect protein protein interaction.
The next step involves afﬁnity puriﬁcation of mRNAs using oligodT, instead of trimming down the RNAs as performed in CLIP-type experiments.
In this way, mRNA-binding proteins that are covalently attached to mRNA molecules will also be pulled down at the same time.
By high-resolution quantitative MS, mRNA interactome can be identiﬁed in a high throughput manner.
These studies have identiﬁed about 800 RBPs, including about 300 RBPs that are not annotated previously [38,39].
In 2012,  Cellular protein RNA interactions enabled by mechanistic crosslinking  More than 100 post-transcriptional RNA modiﬁcations have been identiﬁed in cellular RNAs until now [40].
Yet, identify- ing the modifying enzymes along with their physiological sites of modiﬁcation remains a challenging task [41].
Among these RNA modiﬁcations, RNA cytosine methyla- tion, occurring at the C5 position (m5C), has been detected in tRNAs, rRNAs and mRNAs [42,43].
There are six families of m5C RNA methyltransferase (RMT), but only two of them, NOP2/Sun RMT family member 2 (NSUN2) and DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 2 (DNMT2), have been identi- ﬁed in higher eukaryotes [42].
Both were known previously to work on speciﬁc tRNA molecules [44 46]  yet the full spec- trum of targets remains an open question for both enzymes.
To identity the target sites of these RMT, two groups sepa- rately developed two new crosslinking methods to capture RNA-modifying enzymes that are linked directly to their tar- gets.
Both methods involve the formation of covalent RNP   76  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 72 78  A  B  C  Cytosine  NH2  N  N  O  RMT-SH  NH 2  N  SAM  SAH  m5C  H3C  NH 2  N  RMT  S  N  O  N  O  +  RMT-SH  5-aza-C  NH 2  RMT-SH  N  N  N  O  NH 2  HN  N  RMT  S  N  O  Cytosine  NH2  C271A-SH  N  N  O  NH 2  N  SAM  SAH  H 3C  NH 2  N  C271A  S  N  O  C271A  S  N  O  Figure 2 Mechanistic crosslinking of RNA-modifying enzymes and target RNA molecules A.

they are based on enzymatic mechanism  complexes, yet instead of using UV-crosslinking [47,48].
It has been found that m5C-RMT could form a covalent enzyme substrate intermediate during the methylation reac- tions [42].
The covalent bond is formed, at the early stage of methylation process, between a cysteine residue of the m5C- RMT and the C6 atom of cytosine of the RNA target.
Then the RNA methyltransferase transfers a methyl group from cofactor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the C5 of the target cytosine (Figure 2).
The enzyme is ﬁnally released by b-elimina- tion.
Interestingly, studies have shown that if the cytosine of the RNA targets is replaced by a cytosine analogue, 5-azacytidine (5-aza-C), the methyltransferase cannot be released from the RNA target sites and thus remains covalently attached to its tar- gets (Figure 2).
Based on this mechanism, Khoddami and Cairns developed a mechanistic crosslinking method called Aza-IP.
They incorporated 5-aza-C into nascent RNA by feeding cells with 5-aza-C  they then immunoprecipitated the m5C-RMT, together with its target RNAs.
Finally, the target sites can be identiﬁed by deep sequencing and computational analysis [48].
Besides the use of cytosine analogues to trap the m5C- RMT, mutation to the methyltransferase can also stabilize the covalently-linked protein RNA during the catalytic pro- cess.
For instance, Cys321 of NSUN2 can form the covalent bond with the cytosine of the target RNA sites.
Another cys- teine at position 271 (Cys271) of NSUN2 is required for the release of the methylated RNA.
If Cys271 is mutated to ala- nine, the methyltransferase cannot be released from the RNA target sites (Figure 2).
By utilizing such enzyme properties, Hussain and his colleagues successfully crosslinked the RNA targets of NSUN2  the remaining strategy for  sequencing the RNA resembles those of iCLIP, therefore they termed the method methylation iCLIP (miCLIP) [47].
Towards more RNA-modifying enzymes  RNA molecules are intensively modiﬁed  yet the interactions between RNA targets and RNA-modifying enzymes are often transient.
We discussed mechanistic crosslinking in the section above to study interactions between RNA targets and m5C- RMT  both   Aza-IP   and   miCLIP   rely on the detailed knowledge of the enzymatic mechanism and the usage of either a mechanism-based inhibitor, 5-aza-C, or mutant protein with altered enzymatic action.
However, successful examples towards other RNA modiﬁcations and their related enzymes are still scarce at the moment.
We will use N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modiﬁcation as an example to formulate the challenges and opportunities in identifying, on the genomic level, protein RNA interactions for RNA-modifying enzymes.
m6A is the most abundant endogenous modiﬁcation for mRNA in eukaryotes [49]  and the recent discoveries of two novel m6A demethylases have gained renewed interest for this long-known modiﬁcation [50,51].
The fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), which was ﬁrst identiﬁed through genome-wide association studies to be linked to fat mass and obesity [52], shows efﬁcient demethylation activity towards m6A [50].
Alpha-ketoglutarate- dependent dioxygenase alkB homologue 5 (ALKBH5), another homologue protein of FTO, was later shown to be another m6A demethylase, which impacts RNA metabolism and mouse labs  [51].
More  recently,  fertility  three   Li X et al / Crosslinking RNA-protein Interactions Genome-wide  77  independently reported the identiﬁcation of m6A-methyltrans- ferases [53 55].
In addition, reader proteins of m6A have been suggested [56].
For example, the YTH domain family member 2 (YTHDF2) protein, one of the reader proteins, selectively recognizes m6A and targets the bound mRNA to decay sites, thereby affecting the translation status and lifetime of mRNA [57].
Although the genome-wide characterization of m6A modi- ﬁcation in mRNA has been reported [56,58], many open ques- tions remain for the writer, reader and eraser proteins of the m6A modiﬁcation.
PAR-CLIP experiments have been used to investigate the protein RNA interactions for the writer and reader proteins [53,57]  yet the detailed interaction proﬁles for the eraser proteins FTO and ALKBH5 are still lacking.
Both FTO and ALKBH5 are Fe2+-dependent dioxygenases  they also use the putative   base-ﬂipping   mechanism to gain access to the target m6A base for demethylation reactions [59].
While existing crosslinking methods might still not be able to capture the transient interactions for these eraser proteins, new strategies that take into account their unique enzymatic mechanism could be useful in stabilizing protein RNA interactions.
Conclusion and outlook  Formation of covalent bond between protein and RNA offers an important tool to the identiﬁcation of RNA protein inter- action, as covalently-crosslinked complex can bear stringent puriﬁcation to remove nonspeciﬁcally-bound RNA and pro- tein.
While UV crosslink-based methods are preferentially used for RBPs, mechanism-based crosslinking methods will be par- ticularly useful for RNA-modifying enzymes, since these pro- teins only stay transiently with their RNA targets.
In this review, we summarize technical aspects of several UV-enabled crosslinking strategies, including HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP and several derived methods with individual nucleotide-resolution.
While these methods have allowed many successful studies of RNA protein interactions, challenges still exist for more robust assays.
We hope our comparisons of the existing meth- ods could really stimulate the development of new crosslinking methods with improved crosslinking efﬁciency.
Ultimately, more high-resolution maps of RNA protein interactions can be revealed to understand their biological roles in greater depth and detail.
