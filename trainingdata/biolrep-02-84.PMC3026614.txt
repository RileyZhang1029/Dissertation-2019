Abstract
The study of neuropsychiatric diseases and the development of effective treatments have been limited
by a lack of appropriate models. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a potentially
limitless supply of patient-specific cells for the study of neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we
will discuss the potential and limitations of iPSCs for the development of cell-based models of
neuropsychiatric diseases and the identification of novel therapeutics.

Introduction and context
Neuropsychiatric diseases are amongst the most poorly
understood of human ailments. Severe neuropsychiatric
diseases such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and
autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) exhibit 40-60% con-
cordance in monozygous twins and 60-90% heritability,
suggesting an important role for genotype in disease
etiology [1]. Indeed, numerous rare monogenic deletions
and genomic copy number variations (CNVs) that
predispose patients to the development of specific
neuropsychiatric diseases have been identified [2]. How-
ever, the mechanisms by which these genomic variations
cause psychiatric disease are understood in only a few
cases. Furthermore, these relatively common and complex
diseases are caused by individually rare genomic variations
with variable penetrance [2]. As such, the workhorse of
modern disease modeling – the laboratory mouse – may
be of limited use for the development of appropriate
models of these diseases.

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, which
arose from groundbreaking work performed by Yamanaka
and colleagues [3], represents an exciting new approach to
the modeling of human disease [4,5]. iPSCs are generated
from patient-derived somatic cells (such as skin fibroblasts
or blood [6]) by exogenous expression of specific

‘reprogramming factors’ (Yamanaka’s original reprogram-
ming of human cells employed SOX2, OCT4, KLF4, and
MYC, although other reprogramming factors have been
described). Patient-derived iPSCs exhibit all of the hall-
marks of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), including self-
renewal and pluripotency, and therefore represent a
potentially limitless number of cells for the modeling
of disease. As such, there is great excitement for the
potential of iPSCs for modeling neuropsychiatric dis-
orders and for the development of high-throughput
screens to identify (a) specific genes that mediate the
diseased phenotype and (b) chemicals that may be used as
platforms for the development of efficacious pharmaco-
logical interventions.

Major recent advances
iPSCs from individuals with neuropsychiatric diseases
iPSCs have been generated from
In recent years,
numerous individuals diagnosed with a wide array of
diseases. Indeed, a study described the generation of
iPSCs from 10 individuals each with a different human
disease, including several with psychiatric symptoms,
such as Down’s syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystro-
phy, and Parkinson’s disease [7]. iPSCs have also been
generated from patients with fragile X mental retardation
syndrome (FMR) [8].

Our laboratory recently generated iPSCs from individuals
with Rett syndrome [9], a severe ASD that has been
suggested as an ideal starting point for investigating the
potential of iPSCs for modeling neuropsychiatric disease
[5,10]. Rett syndrome is monogenic, with the vast majority
of cases caused by loss-of-function mutations of the
X-linked MECP2 (methyl CpG binding protein 2) locus;
and is caused by inheritance of a highly penetrant
dominant allele. It has a relatively severe and consistent
phenotype (compared to non-syndromic ASDs) and is an
early-onset disease, which may be more easily modeled
in vitro than a late-onset neuropsychiatric disorder. There-
fore, of the iPSC lines derived from individuals with
neuropsychiatric disorders that have been published to
date, Rett syndrome cell lines represent an excellent model
for future investigations.

X-chromosome inactivation status of iPSCs
Like other X-linked recessive disorders, Rett syndrome
offers an exciting advantage for modeling disease because,
unlike mouse ESCs, which maintain two active X chro-
mosomes until initiation of differentiation, human ESCs
and iPSCs exhibit clone-specific X chromosome inactiva-
tion patterns [11,12]. Therefore, isogenic iPSC lines that
differ only in their X chromosome inactivation status can
be derived from a single tissue donation. Half of the iPSC
lines produced from these cells should exclusively express
the wild-type locus of the gene of interest, whereas the
other half will express the disease-associated locus.
Effectively, this approach will control for genetic back-
ground, thereby facilitating detection of disease-related
phenotypes. For other disorders,
iPSCs derived from
unaffected, gender-matched parents or siblings must
suffice as controls. iPSCs derived from Rett syndrome
patients may greatly facilitate identification of disease-
relevant phenotypes related to neuropsychiatric disease.

Generation of specific neuronal subtypes from iPSCs
In order to model disease, reliable and efficacious
protocols are required to drive iPSC differentiation to
the desired cell type. For example, Parkinson’s disease and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) result
from the
selective loss of midbrain dopamine-producing neurons
and motor neurons, respectively. Therefore, specific
protocols have been developed to drive differentiation
of human pluripotent cells to these specific neuronal
subtypes [13,14]. In the case of neuropsychiatric diseases,
a commonly implicated cell
type is glutamatergic
forebrain neurons, which are responsible for encoding
and transmitting sensory and cognitive information in the
mammalian brain.

In recent years, several approaches have been developed
to drive neuronal commitment of ESCs and iPSCs, and

to subsequently drive these cells to differentiate into
specific neuronal subtypes. For example, two primary
approaches have been used to drive ESCs and iPSCs to
a PAX6+ neuroepithelial state. To achieve this, Zhang
and colleagues [14] used culture conditions designed to
mimic embryonic development, with regards to both the
kinetics of differentiation and the timing of physical and
chemical cues to drive selection of the desired lineages.
Colonies of ESCs and iPSCs were allowed to form
embryoid bodies to promote specification to one of the
three somatic lineages; embryoid bodies were later diss-
ociated and cells were sequentially treated with speci-
fic morphogens and culture conditions over a period of
5-12 weeks to promote neuronal induction and diffe-
rentiation to desired subtypes, such as motor neurons,
dopamine-producing neurons [15], and telencephalic
glutamatergic neurons [16]. Studer and colleagues [13],
on the other hand, directed neuronal cell fate specification
under adherent conditions by inhibition of SMAD (small
mothers against decapentaplegic) signaling using recom-
binant Noggin and the drug SB431542. This approach
likely increased homogeneity of differentiated cultures, as
it obviated the embryoid body procedure used by Zhang
and colleagues, which inherently introduced heterogene-
ity in the population of precursors directed toward specific
neuronal cell fates. Similar to neuronal precursors derived
from embryoid bodies, those generated by SMAD inhibi-
tion were efficiently differentiated into motor neurons
and dopamine-producing neurons [13]. Therefore, at least
two distinct approaches exist to drive iPSCs towards the
neuronal lineage, and (regardless of the approach) these
precursors can be directed towards specific neuronal
cell types.

The two approaches described above were both used to
drive neuronal specification and differentiation of both
ESC and iPSC lines. Studer and colleagues used a
predominantly qualitative approach in the examination
of neuronal cell type specification and did not report
significant differences between ESC and iPSC lines in the
efficiency of neuronal differentiation [13]. Zhang and
colleagues found that both ESCs and iPSCs differentiated
to specific lineages with similar kinetics, although iPSCs
generally exhibited reduced efficiency of differentiation
and notable interline variability [14]. Interestingly, there
was no correlation between the factors or approaches
used to reprogram somatic cells and the differentiation
capacity of iPSCs.

Selecting appropriate neuronal subtypes for
disease modeling
To effectively model disease in vitro, iPSC differentiation
must be directed to the appropriate cell type. In the case
of complex neuropsychiatric disorders, the appropriate

http://f1000.com/reports/b/2/84

cell type is not always known a priori. Furthermore, in
several cases, cellular dissection of neuronal disease has
revealed cell-nonautonomous etiologies.

The potential for cell-nonautonomous effects in modeling
disease have been exemplified by recent studies from
groups led by Kevin Eggan, Gail Mandel, and Mario
Capecchi. While modeling ALS, which results from the
selective loss of motor neurons, Eggan and colleagues
found that motor neurons derived from normal ESCs
degenerated when cultured with glial cells that encoded an
ALS-associated mutation [17]. Similarly, wild-type neu-
rons cultured with Mecp2-mutant glia exhibited extensive
deficits in dendritic morphology, which is reflective of
neuronal phenotypes exhibited by patients with Rett
syndrome [18]. Definitive support for the possibility that
behavioral phenotypes can arise due to the effects of
non-neuronal cells was recently obtained from analyses of
Hoxb8 mutant mice, which exhibit pathological grooming
behavior and could therefore be used as a possible model
of obsessive compulsive disorder [19]. Interestingly, the
only cells within the mouse brain that express Hoxb8 are
bone marrow-derived microglia, and transplantation of
wild-type hematopoietic progenitors into lethally irra-
diated mice resulted in normal grooming behavior in
Hoxb8-null animals. These studies suggest that, at least
in some cases, homogeneous cultures of differentiated
neurons may not recapitulate the diseased phenotype
in vitro when modeling neuropsychiatric disorders.

Genetic manipulation of human iPSCs
Modeling of disease using iPSCs will be greatly improved
by new technological developments that facilitate genetic
manipulation of these cells. Compared to their mouse
counterparts, human ESCs are notoriously refractory
to the application of transgenic technologies such as
homologous recombination. However, two recent reports
described approaches to temporarily reprogram human
cells to a mouse-like pluripotent ‘ground state’, resulting
in human-derived cells with morphological and func-
tional properties similar to those of mouse ESCs [11,20].
Interestingly, among the mouse-like properties exhibited
by transiently-reverted human cells was efficient genetic
manipulation by homologous recombination [20]. Thus,
temporary reprogramming of human cells to a mouse-like
state will assist in the future application of gene targeting
technology in order to better understand neuropsychiatric
disease.

Technical considerations for the use of iPSCs to
model disease
The relative novelty of iPSC technology has resulted in
a flood of new data that support the utility of iPSCs
to model disease, while also reminding us that this

promising approach faces many hurdles on the course to
widespread use.

Many neuropsychiatric disorders have been causatively
linked to specific CNVs. For example, inherited and de
novo CNVs of the 16p11.2 locus have been shown to
predispose patients to develop ASDs, schizophrenia, and
bipolar disorder [21]. Therefore, clinically diagnosed
patients with specific disease-associated CNVs, such as
16p11.2, represent
ideal candidates for iPSC-based
models of neuropsychiatric disease. However, a recent
report suggests that CNV loci are unstable throughout
the passaging of ESCs [22]. Therefore, it is essential that
iPSCs derived from patients with CNVs associated with
psychiatric disease are characterized before phenotypic
analyses in order to ensure that patient-specific CNVs are
reflected within iPSC lines.

Disease modeling has also been limited by the failure to
successfully recapitulate expression of disease-associated
genes in reprogrammed cells. A recent report described the
generation of iPSCs from patients with fragile X mental
retardation syndrome, an ASD that results from loss of
function of the X-encoded FMR1 gene [8]. When ESCs
were derived from preimplantation-diagnosed FMR
embryos, FMR1 expression was observed in undifferen-
tiated cells but was silenced upon terminal differentiation.
In contrast, iPSCs generated from three FMR patients
failed to reactivate FMR1 expression during reprogram-
ming. These data suggest that (a) iPSCs and ESCs exhibit
notable, but poorly understood, biological differences;
(b) some diseases are not amenable to modeling using
current
iPSC technology; and (c) donor cell-specific
patterns of gene expression may be retained during the
reprogramming process (a conclusion that was supported
by two recent reports [6,23]).

An important consideration for the design and inter-
pretation of experiments using iPSCs is heterogeneity
(reviewed in [4]). Humans are an outbred population
with tremendous genetic variation. In the absence of
disease-specific iPSC lines with isogenic controls, appro-
priate control
iPSC lines from unaffected, gender-
matched parents or siblings are essential for identifying
relevant phenotypes. Also, it is imperative that numerous
high-quality iPSC lines (i.e., technical replicates) are
derived from both patients and healthy controls. With
development of
improved neuronal differentiation
protocols and/or methods for the isolation and growth
of committed neuronal progenitors, researchers may
be able to overcome observed deficits in the efficiency
of neuronal differentiation of iPSCs, which will hope-
fully decrease line-to-line variability. Finally, because
integrated transgenes may influence gene expression

patterns, transgene-free methods may reduce heteroge-
neity between iPSC lines used for disease modeling.

Genetic rescue experiments that correct a causative
mutation or CNV will be essential for confirming the
biological relevance of differences observed between
iPSCs from patients and controls. For example, any
differences observed between iPSC-derived neurons
from patients with Rett Syndrome and their relatives
should be ameliorated by restoration of wild-type MECP2
expression [24]. A key consideration in the design of
effective genetic rescue experiments is the choice of
transcriptional regulatory elements used to drive expres-
sion of the transgene. Neuropsychiatric diseases such as
autism can result from both the loss or gain of dosage-
sensitive genomic loci, including MECP2 [25]. Therefore,
expression of disease-associated genes using strong,
constitutively active promoters may exceed normal
expression levels, thereby causing further neuronal dys-
function. As such, an attractive alternative for the design of
genetic rescue experiments is to use endogenous regula-
tory elements to drive appropriate levels of transgene
expression in appropriate cell types [24].

Identifying therapeutics using iPSCs
iPSCs not only represent a useful model for under-
standing disease but also have tremendous potential for
identifying therapeutics for complex neuropsychiatric
disorders. Modern libraries of complementary DNA,
short hairpin RNA, and small molecules represent
heretofore unimaginable possibilities for the develop-
ment of unbiased high-throughput screens to identify the
genes and chemicals that modify the diseased phenotype
[26]. However, the development of high-throughput
screens requires (a) identification of a relevant cell type
affected by the disease-associated mutation, (b) differ-
entiation of iPSCs to the given cell type, (c) development
of culture conditions that recapitulate disease-associated
phenotype(s) in vitro, and most importantly, (d) identi-
fication of phenotypes that are experimentally tractable
for high-throughput screens.

Two recent studies illustrate the potential for iPSCs in both
the modeling of disease and for testing possible ther-
apeutics. Each study characterized iPSCs directed towards
disease-relevant cell types, identified disease-associated
phenotypes in vitro, and corrected these phenotypes using
small molecules. However, both studies employed pre-
viously identified compounds for alleviation of
the
diseased phenotype. For example, one report showed
that treatment of iPSC-derived motor neurons from
patients with spinal muscular atrophy with valproic acid
or tobramycin increased expression of the hemizygous-
mutated gene that causes the disease [27]. Similarly,

administration of kinetin, a plant-derived compound,
partially rescued neurogenesis defects that resulted from
mutations associated with familial dysautonomia [28].
Therefore, proof-of-principle has been provided regard-
ing the application of patient-derived iPSCs for the
modeling of neuronal disease, and for their potential in
the identification of therapeutics.

Future directions
Modeling of neuropsychiatric disease using iPSCs is still
in the earliest stages and widespread implementation of
this approach will require theoretical and technical
developments in several key areas. As a first step, extensive
characterization of iPSC-derived neurons (from patients
and controls) will be necessary in order to identify disease-
relevant phenotypes. Development of screens for factors
that modify neuronal function will require identification
of phenotypes that can be analyzed using techniques that
are amenable to high-throughput screens, such as high-
content imaging. Traditional approaches used to analyze
neuronal function, such as electrophysiological record-
ings, will be of limited use to the large-scale screens
envisioned for future gene and drug discovery ventures.
Optical analyses of neuronal morphology, synapse
formation, and calcium signaling may be better suited to
such screens (reviewed in [29]). Optogenetic approaches
have been used as a platform for the development of high-
throughput screens of synaptic function in the worm
Caenorhabditis elegans [30] and a recent report described
optogenetic stimulation of human ESC-derived neurons,
both in vitro and in vivo [31].

Many challenges must be overcome before iPSCs can
achieve their full potential for modeling disease. However,
in light of the limited understanding of neuropsychiatric
disorders that has arisen from studies of the available
models, these efforts are more than justified and should
be pursued.
