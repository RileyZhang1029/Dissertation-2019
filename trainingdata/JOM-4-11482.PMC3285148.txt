Host-pathogen interactions in bacteria

Hostpathogen dynamics: it’s complicated!
This set of three review articles on hostpathogen

interactions begins with a discussion of emerging
concepts on homeostasis of a specific microbiome,
that of the gut, and how disruption of the microbial
status quo can result in several syndromes (1). The
following papers highlight research on hostpathogen
interactions with two oral bacteria: the dynamics between
Treponema denticola virulence factors and host proteins
(2); and Porphyromonas gingivalis infection of a novel
animal model that will ultimately shed light on pathogen-
esis and innate immune responses to the organism (3).

Research on the pathogenic infection of animal hosts
began with whole animal studies (see (4) for a review of the
work by Pasteur and Koch, and Riedel (5) for the work of
Jenner on small pox vaccination), an approach that
yielded many milestones in our understanding of infection
and tremendous medical benefits for generations of
humans. With the advent of bacterial genetics, and later
molecular biology, the reductionist approach has held
sway for the past 40 years with obvious triumphs such
as the development of the field of cellular microbiology
and whole genome sequencing of pathogenic (and non-
pathogenic) microorganisms. More recently, the ability to
isolate and amplify nucleic acids from small biological/
clinical samples together with technological advances in
high throughput deep sequencing enables us to look
beyond which organisms are present in a specific ecologi-
cal niche (i.e. the microbiome of the oral cavity, skin, gut,
etc.) and ask ‘what are they doing?’ This is the key to
understanding how a specific microbiome communicates
with the host in both health and disease.

Because we and our microbiome have evolved together,
we rationalize that the equilibrium between us results in
health, and disruption of
the homeostasis leads to
disease. The constituent microbes in a microbiome do
not act alone and alliances have evolved with each other,
and with host proteins and cells. Recently, Brown &
Whitely examined the metabolic relationship between the
oral bacteria Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans
(Aa) and streptococci. Because they inhabit the same
environmental niche, the gingival pocket, it was reasoned
that Aa must derive benefits from this coexistence.
Streptococci efficiently produce lactic acid from 6-carbon
sugars and dietary sucrose, and it was established that Aa
preferentially utilizes lactic acid as a carbon source over
glucose, fructose, mannose, even at the cost of a lowered
growth rate (6). Furthermore, Aa consumed the lactate
produced from sucrose catabolized by S. gordonii.
Microarray-based comparative transcription profiling
was used to measure the Aa response to hydrogen

peroxide, another metabolite produced by streptococci
(7). Surprisingly, only two genes were significantly
induced after exposure to sublethal concentrations of
peroxide: katA whose product detoxifies peroxide to
water and oxygen, and apiA, encoding a multifunctional
outer membrane protein that also mediates binding to
serum protein factor H, a complement
regulatory
protein, thus blocking and protecting Aa from being
killed by the alternate complement pathway. Expression
of both katA and apiA is activated by the OxyR
transcriptional regulator. Finally, to test the biological
relevance of these interactions, it was demonstrated that
coculture with S. gordonii enhances virulence of Aa in a
murine abscess model
(8). Thus, many intermicrobe
alliances that are based on nutritional dependencies
may also affect host functions.

The literature is

replete with examples of how
microorganisms use host proteins for adherence to and,
in certain cases, to promote their internalization by host
cells. In turn, adherence to host cell surface proteins may
trigger host innate immune responses such as production
of antimicrobial peptides. This is not the only form of
‘dialogue’ between bacteria and host. It has long been
established that bacteria communicate with each other
via autoinducers (AI-1, AI-2, AI-3, and AIP) leading to
the regulation of specific genes and pathways (912). A
new participant was introduced into this conversation
with the discovery that host cells communicate with
commensal bacteria via the interaction of epinephrine/
norepinephrine (host) and AI-3. This interkingdom
dialog was first described by Sperandio et al. (13).
Bacteria in the gut,
including commensal Escherichia
coli and pathogenic EHEC and EPEC strains, produce
AI-3 (14); and mammalian hormones epinephrine and
norepinephrine are also present in the intestine (15).
EHEC and other pathogens sense the hormones through
the QseBC two-component system, of which the QseC
sensor histidine kinase is a receptor for and activated
by epinephrine/norepinephrine (16).
In the ensuing
regulation cascade (17), QseC activates its cognate
response regulator QseB and also KdpE and QseF to
up regulate expression of virulence genes such as those
involved in the production of
flagella and motility
(QseB); potassium uptake, osmotic protection, and the
formation of attaching and effacing lesions (KdpE); and
the SOS response (QseF) (18).

The themes of

these two examples apply to the
major oral
infections, caries, and periodontal disease.
The ecology and physiology that regulate the growth
and persistence of
these host-associated microbial

cooperativity.
Microaerobic and anaerobic growth conditions favor
cross-feeding and syntrophy (mutualism) because the
disposal of metabolism-derived electrons is problematic
in the absence of oxygen as an acceptor. What are the
complex cross-feeding and syntrophic strategies that have
evolved between anaerobes, microaerobes, and aerobes in
the oral cavity? In the case of periodontitis, what triggers
the disruption of
the healthy homeostasis? Does
the subgingival microbiota communicate with gingival
epithelium via as yet unknown extracellular signaling
systems?

Increased knowledge of the systems we study has
shown them to be more complicated than we ever
imagined but provokes a reluctant appreciation for the
ingenuity of the discourse.
