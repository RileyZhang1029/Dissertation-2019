Abstract
Ultra-high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) techniques are evolving rapidly and may soon become an
affordable and routine tool for sequencing plant DNA, even in smaller plant biology labs. Here we
review recent insights into intraspecific genome variation gained from UHTS, which offers a glimpse
of the rather unexpected levels of structural variability among Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. The
challenges that will need to be addressed to efficiently assemble and exploit this information are also
discussed.

Introduction and context
The introduction of ‘next-generation’ sequencing tech-
nologies has had a tremendous impact on all areas of
biology dealing with genomic information, from popu-
lation genetics to comparative genomics, including the
plant sciences [1,2]. This impact is expected to grow
exponentially as technical advances are continuously
increasing the length and quality of sequenced DNA
fragments while decreasing the cost of the process. The
throughput of current ultra-high-throughput sequencing
(UHTS) equipment has already reached several giga base
pairs per run, which means that complex multicellular
organisms with an average-sized genome, such as the
model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), can be
sequenced at reasonable coverage and cost. To reliably
assemble whole genome sequences from the short reads
generated by UHTS, a well-defined, high-quality refer-
ence genome still remains invaluable. This is the case for
Arabidopsis [3], which was one of
the immediate
candidate organisms for resequencing projects. Indeed,
a few studies have already focused on comparative
analysis of divergent Arabidopsis genomes to character-
ize the extent of intraspecific genome variation with
respect to the Columbia-0 (Col-0) reference accession
[4,5].

Major recent advances
Sufficient funding permitting, these initial studies are just
the prelude to the ambitious ‘1001 Genomes Project’,
which aims to resequence divergent Arabidopsis acces-
sions by the hundreds [6]. In a pilot study [4], Ossowski
et al. resequenced the genome of Col-0, revealing more
than 2000 homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and insertions and deletions (indels) that
represent potential errors in the original annotation or
spontaneous mutations (see below). Moreover,
they
analyzed the genome of two divergent strains and found
that each of them carries more than 800,000 SNPs and
80,000 short indels. Longer indels were difficult to assess
from the short reads by simple re-mapping to the reference
genome. However, a de novo assembly approach allowed
the authors to identify some larger structural variants by
starting from reads that flanked regions characterized by
low coverage. Using an alternative, combinatorial
approach, Santuari et al. [5] evaluated the genome-wide
abundance of large-scale deletions in four Arabidopsis
strains sequenced at moderate coverage. The authors
demonstrated that the intersection of signal intensities
from tiling array hybridizations with UHTS read coverage
accurately detects larger deletions. Hundreds of major
deletions were observed, which frequently affect gene

function. Among them, transposable elements were found
to be overrepresented, suggesting that the majority of
genomic rearrangements identified result from the activity
of mobile elements. Such activity was recently also
observed in real time [7]. Individual deletions were
frequently observed in two or more of the accessions
examined, suggesting that variation in gene content partly
reflects a common history of deletion events.

In summary, the characterization of only a limited number
of divergent Arabidopsis genomes has already identified an
unexpected degree of structural diversity that significantly
affects gene content and function [4,5,8] (Figure 1).
Although the majority of those polymorphisms suppo-
sedly originated in the wild, recent studies have highlighted
the dynamics of the evolutionary process over merely a few
generations, as exemplified in another pioneering publi-
cation by Ossowski et al. [9]. In this paper, the authors used
next-generation sequencing to evaluate the rate and accu-
mulation of spontaneous mutations across several gene-
rations. They analyzed five Col-0 lines that had been
maintained for 30 generations and found a mutation per
site rate equaling 7×10–9 base pairs per generation. Thus,
Arabidopsis geneticists are confronted with the finding that

mutant lines and reference backgrounds might be more
disparate than suspected. In practice, this should not pose a
major problem as most mutations observed are essentially
neutral. However, another study analyzing structural
genome variation over several inbred generations subjected
to stress treatment found major, stress-induced structural
variation that could significantly affect phenotype [10].
Although purely array-based and thus not ultimately
conclusive, if confirmed by UHTS, these findings might
force us to rethink our notions of genome stability.

Future directions
As this perspective is written, it is already likely to be
superseded by ongoing technological progress, which
should soon permit routine identification of structural
genome variants. For
instance, using paired-end
sequencing it is already possible to follow the move-
ments of transposons, which are highlighted as mis-
mappings of the two ends of a sequenced fragment on
the reference genome. Beyond hardware improve-
ments, the development of bioinformatics tools will
also be a major driver. Already several tools have been
developed to detect
inter- and intra-chromosomal
rearrangements [11,12].

Figure 1. Example of a major common deletion affecting multiple genes

A region on Arabidopsis chromosome 4 of approximately 68 kilo base pairs (kb) contains a series of receptor-like protein kinase-related proteins in Col-0,
but shows a clear lack of read coverage in the Eilenberg-0 (Eil-0) strain (top), as depicted by the grey bars, and significant decrease in coverage for the other
strains in the diagram. A closer look reveals that a major number of reads mapped to this region are probably mis-mapped and thus misleading due to very low
mapping quality. Overall, this picture indicates a series of large scale deletions comprising at least 15 genes that are present in the Col-0 strain, represented by
the brx-2 mutant obtained from a Col-0 background, but missing in all four other strains. Lc-0, Loch Ness-0; Sav-0, Slavice-0, Tsu-1, Tsushima-1.

The read length provided by the current versions of most
UHTS platforms coupled with different insert size libraries
will ultimately make it feasible to move from analysis that
is focused on read mapping onto a reference genome
towards a reference-free, de novo assembly approach. This
is critical to overcome the intrinsic limitations dictated by
relying on a single reference sequence. The collection of
high-quality scaffolds and contigs from divergent Arabi-
dopsis accessions could be used to define genomic regions
that may have accumulated a degree of divergence that
would prevent
their accurate elucidation by classical
mapping approaches (Figure 2). In particular, in the case
of duplicated or partially conserved regions, the assembly
itself is limited by the highly repetitive content of these
sequences. The integration of data from the reference
mapping with assembled scaffolds will help to reconstruct
specific regions that would otherwise be hard to decipher
using either mapping or assembly alone. De novo
assembly algorithms that take into account the read
mapping position on the reference sequence are already
being developed, such as LOCAS [13] or the recent
Columbus algorithm implemented in Velvet [14,15].
Notably, these tools can also assemble genomes from low

coverage data, further decreasing costs. Another important
challenge in analyzing these data is how to make them
accessible and useful to researchers. This will probably be
driven by increasingly advanced and intuitive genome
browsers, such as the recent version of Ensembl Plants or
GenomeMapper [16].

Beyond the utility of UHTS in every day lab approaches,
such as mutant mapping [17], one might ask: why should
we generate these data? Clearly, one of the greatest
promises lies in their integration into genome-wide
association studies [18], which would enable us to
move from assessing the qualitative and quantitative
effects of a single locus towards identifying and evaluating
the systemic effects of multiple genes involved in a trait of
interest [18-20]. The genome sequences of specific
parental accessions would also greatly accelerate standard
quantitative genetics approaches, such as quantitative trait
locus analysis of recombinant inbred lines. Maybe most
importantly, sequencing hundreds of strains, as proposed
by the ‘1001 Genomes Project’, will not only indicate
which genes are divergent, missing, or not functional
with respect to the Col-0 reference sequence in a given

Figure 2. Ambiguity in resolving loci that include duplicated genes and deletions

The AOP3 gene, involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis and thus pathogen defense, appears to be duplicated in an exact copy in the Eilenberg-0 (Eil-0)
accession, as indicated by homozygous single nucelotide polymorphisms depicted with colored vertical lines. Breakpoints are genomic regions where both
ends of a fragment sequenced with the paired-end library are mapped on the reference genome at a distance that is significantly different from the insert size
of the library, suggesting structural rearrangements. Here, the reads supporting breakpoints are shown in different colors, with each color representing the
chromosome where the other end of the fragment is located. Following these reads, it is possible to reconstruct where the second copy of AOP3 is located,
which appears to be 10 kilo base pairs downstream of its original locus, immediately downstream of the AOP2 locus in Col-0. Lc-0, Loch Ness-0.

accession, but will also lead to the discovery of genes that
are present in the worldwide Arabidopsis population
(but absent from Col-0). Without this ‘dark matter’ of the
Arabidopsis genome, defining the full gene complement
of the species and gaining a complete understanding of
the ecological-evolutionary and developmental history of
this plant cannot be attained.
