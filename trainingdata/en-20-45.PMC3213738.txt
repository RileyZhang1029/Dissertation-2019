ABSTRACT

the  early  cellular  events  occurring 

Cultured  cortical  primary  astroglia  treated  with  zinc  died  while  rapidly  detached  from 
culture  plates,  a  distinct  part  of  zinc-treated  astroglia.  In  the  present  study,  we 
investigated  the  mechanism  underlying  the  rapid  change  in  the  morphologic  integrity  of 
zinc-treated  astroglia.  Among 
in  zinc-treated 
astroglia,  strong  activation  of  p38  MAPK  and  JNK  was  evident.  Although  inhibitors  of 
p38  (SB203580  and  SB202190)  or  JNK  (SP600125)  did  not  protect  zinc-insulted 
astroglia  from  cell  death,  the  p38  inhibitors,  but  not  the  JNK  inhibitor,  suppressed  actin 
filament  and  cell  morphology  disruption.  The  Ca2＋  ionophore,  A23187,  also  suppress-
ed  actin  filament  and  cell  morphology  disruption,  but  not  cell  death,  of  zinc-insulted 
astroglia.  However,  A23187  did  not 
in  zinc-treated 
astroglia.  Together  these  results  suggest  that  zinc  influx  in  astroglia  results  in  rapid 
loss  of  the  morphologic  integrity  via  mechanisms  regulated  by  p38  kinase  and/or  Ca2＋ 
signaling.

INTRODUCTION

    Acute  pathologic  conditions,  such  as  cerebral 
ischemia,  induce  excess  release  of  free  zinc  from 
excitatory  synapses,  and  excessively  released  zinc 
causes  brain  cells  to  die  (Frederickson  et  al.,  2005). 
Zinc-induced  cell  death  occurs  via  zinc  influx  into 
cells,  and  zinc  influx  results  in  disruption  of  thiol 
homeostasis  and  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS) 
stress  (Frederickson  et  al.,  1988;  Kim  et  al.,  1999a;

1999b;  Suh  et  al.,  2000;  Kim  et  al.,  2003).  In  vitro 
studies  have  shown  that  both  neurons  and  astroglia 
are  sensitive  to  chronic  low  doses  of  free  zinc 
(Dineley  et  al.,  2000;  Cho  et  al.,  2003;  Ralph  et  al., 
2010).  Cultured  primary  astroglia  cells  challenged 
with  free  zinc  become  elongated  in  shape,  swell 
and  soon  thereafter  detach  from  the  culture  plate. 
The  rapid  change  and  characteristic  loss  of  mor-
phologic  integrity  of  astroglia  cells  precedes  with  the 
events  leading  to  cell  death  (Cho  et  al.,  2003;  Kim 
et  al.,  2003).  Astroglial  cell  death  induced  by  zinc  is 
different  from  that  of  other  insults,  such  as  H2O2  or 
Fe2＋
,  in  that  astroglia  cells  treated  with  the  latter 
stimulants  undergo  demise,  while  most  cells  are

plate,  might  proceed  with  disruption  of  cytoskeletal 
elements.  Because  zinc-induced  astroglia  death  is 
initiated  by  zinc-influx  (Ryu  et  al.,  2002;  Kim  et  al., 
2003),  the  rapid  and  distinct  loss  of  morphologic 
integrity  is  likely  to  occur  via  zinc-mediated  changes 
in  dynamics  of  cytoskeletal  elements.  However,  it  is 
unclear  how  this  process  occurs  and  whether  intra-
cellular  cytoskeleton  dysregulation  is  a  prerequisite 
to  the  cell  death  process  in  zinc-insulted  cells.
    Actin  is  the  major  cytoskeletal  element  in  most 
eukaryotic  cells.  Failure  of  actin  dynamics  leads  to 
disruption  of  cell  morphology  (Carlier  et  al.,  1994; 
Dalle-Donne  et  al.,  2001).  Actin  dynamics  and  cell 
morphology  have  been  shown  to  be  regulated  by 
several  factors,  including  mitogen-activated  protein 
kinases  (MAPKs).  For  instance,  the  MEK  inhibitor, 
U0126,  blocks  stellate  process  extension  of  fibro-
blast  growth  factor  2  (FGF2)-treated  astroglia  in 
vitro,  while  inhibition  of  the  p38  MAPK  pathway  by 
SB202190 
facilitate  stellate  process  growth  and 
extension  of  the  same  cells  (Heffron  and  Mandell, 
2005).  The  p38  MAPK  cascade  regulates  actin 
polymerization  in  platelet-derived  growth  factor-in-
duced  cytoskeleton  remodeling  of  aortic  smooth 
muscle  cells  (Pichon  et  al.,  2004).  p38  MAPK 
activation  induces  actin  re-arrangements  in  VEGF- 
treated  human  endothelial  cells  (Rousseau  et  al., 
1997).  MAPK  activated  protein  kinase  2  regulates 
actin  polymerization  in  ventilator  associated  lung 
injury  (Damarla  et  al.,  2009).
    Intracellular  Ca2+  homeostasis  is  also  important  in 
the  maintenance  of  cell  morphology.  Calcium 
stimulates  actin  filament  assembly  (Downey  et  al., 
1990;  Carlier  et  al.,  1994),  and  Ca2+-mediated  actin 
filament 
to  growth  cone 
behaviors,  synaptic  vesicle  trafficking  in  presynaptic 
terminals,  and  synaptic  plasticity  in  dendritic  spines 
of  postsynaptic  neurons  (Matus,  2000;  Levitan, 
2008).  Calcium  also  activates  Ca2+-dependent  pro-
teases,  for  examples  calpains,  that  cleave  actin- 
binding  proteins,  dissociating  the  anchorage  between 
the  plasma  membrane  and  cytoskeleton  (Harris  and 
Morrow,  1990;  Carragher  and  Frame,  2002). 
    MAPKs  are  important  elements  in  neuronal  and 
non-neuronal  cell  death  (Wang  et  al.,  1998;  Guo 
and  Bhat,  2007).  Zinc 
influx  stimulates  MAPK 
pathways  in  neuronal  cells  (Seo  et  al.,  2001;  An  et 
al.,  2005).  ERK1/2  signaling  leads  to  mitochondrial 

regulation  contributes 

dysfunction  in  extracellular  zinc-induced  neurotoxi-
city  in  rat  cultured  neurons  (He  and  Aizenman, 
2010).  In  the  present  study,  we  explored  the  me-
chanisms  that  underlie  rapid  changes  in  the  mor-
phologic  integrity  of  zinc-treated  astroglia.

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

Primary  neuronal  and  astroglial  cultures

laminin 

(100μg/ml)  and 

    Primary  cortical  neuron  and  astroglia  were  cul-
tured,  as  described  previously  (Cho  et  al.,  2003;  Im 
et  al.,  2006a).  Primary  cortical  neuronal  cultures 
were  prepared  from  embryonic  day  15.5  (E15.5) 
ICR  mouse  cortices.  Mouse  cortices  were  triturated 
and  dissociated  cortical  cells  were  plated  in  minimal 
essential  medium  (MEM)  supplemented  with  20  mM 
glucose,  5%  fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS),  5%  horse 
serum,  and  2  mM  glutamine,  at  a  density  of  5 
hemispheres  per  plate  (4×105  cells  per  well)  onto 
(4μg/ml) 
poly-D-lysine 
coated  24-well  plates.  On  day  6  in  vitro  (DIV6), 
cytosine  arabinoside  was  added  to  a  final  con-
centration  of  10μM  and  maintained  for  2  days  to 
halt  glial  growth.  FBS  and  glutamine  were  not 
supplemented  in  the  culture  medium  from  day  6, 
and  the  medium  was  changed  twice  a  week  after 
day  8.  Cultures  in  DIV13-15  were  used  for  studies. 
When 
treated  with  zinc  and/or  drugs,  HEPES- 
buffered  salt  solution  (120  mM  NaCl,  5.4  mM  KCl, 
0.8  mM  MgCl2,  1.8  mM  CaCl2,  20  mM  HEPES,  10 
mM  NaOH,  and  15  mM  glucose)  was  used.
    Cortical  astroglia  cells  were  cultured,  as  describ-
ed  previously  (Cho  et  al.,  2003;  Im  et  al.,  2006b). 
ICR  neonatal  mice  (day  0-1)  were  sacrificed  and 
the  cortices  were  isolated.  Dissociated  cortical  cells 
were  plated  in  MEM  supplemented  with  20  mM 
glucose,  5%  fetal  bovine  serum,  5%  horse  serum,  2 
mM  glutamine,  50μg/ml  streptomycin,  and  50 
unit/ml  penicillin  at  a  density  of  2  hemispheres  per 
plate  (5×104  cells  per  well)  onto  poly-D-lysine-coat-
ed  (20μg/ml)  24-well  plates.  Cells  were  maintained 
at  37oC  in  a  humidified  5%  CO2  incubator.  The 
medium  was  changed  twice  a  week.  The  experi-
ments  were  carried  out  on  cells  which  were  grown 
to  confluence,  and  obtained  after  2  weeks  of 
culturing.  Cortical  astroglia  cultures  were  charac-
terized  by  anti-GFAP  antibody  (Dako,  Carpinteria, 
CA,  USA),  an  astrocyte  marker,  and  isolectin  B4 

conjugated  antibody  (Sigma,  St.  Louis,  MO,  USA), 
a  microglia  marker,  as  described  previously  (Cho  et 
al.,  2003).  Various  inhibitors  or  drugs,  including 
SB203580  and  SB202190,  were  obtained 
from 
Calbiochem  (La  Jolla,  CA,  USA).

Western  blot  analysis

    Western  blot  analysis  was  carried  out  as  des-
cribed  previously  (Im  et  al.,  2006a).  Briefly,  primary 
astroglia  were  suspended  in  lysis  buffer  containing 
150  mM  NaCl,  1%  NP-40,  0.1%  SDS,  0.5%  sodium 
deoxycholate,  1  mM  phenylmethylsulfonyl  fluoride 
(PMSF),  1  mM  Sodium  orthovanadate  (Na3VO4), 
and  protease 
inhibitor  cocktails  (Roche,  Basel, 
Swiss)  in  20  mM  Tris-HCl  (pH  7.4).  Lysates  were 
centrifuged  for  10  min  at  12,000  rpm  at  4oC,  and 
the  resulting  supernatants  were  collected.  Protein 
contents  were  determined  using  a  bicinchoninic  acid 
assay  kit  (St.  Louis,  MO,  USA).  Protein  samples 
were  electrophoresed  by  10%  SDS-PAGE  and  then 
transferred  to  polyvinylidene  difluoride  membranes 
(Bio-Rad,  Hercules,  CA,  USA).  The  blots  were 
blocked  with  5%  non-fat  dried  milk  for  1  h  and 
incubated  with  primary  antibodies  overnight  at  4oC. 
The  secondary  antibody  was  incubated  for  1  h  and 
specific  signals  were  detected  using  an  enhanced 
chemiluminescence  (ECL)  kit  (Amersham,  Bucking-
hamshire,  UK). 
Immunoblotting  was  performed 
using  polyclonal  anti-phospho-p38  (1：1,000,  Cell 
signaling,  USA),  polyclonal  anti-phospho-JNK  (1：
1,000,  Cell  signaling,  USA),  polyclonal  anti-p38  (1：
1,000,  Santa  Cruz,  CA,  USA),  and  monoclonal 
anti-JNK1  (1：1,000,  Pharmingen,  USA).

Assessments  of  cell  death

to  use 

treatment 

    Cell  death  was  assessed  by  measuring 
the 
activity  of  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  released  in 
culture  medium  as  described  previously  (Im  et  al., 
2006a).  Culture  medium  was  collected  24  h  after 
drug 
for  LDH  activity  unless 
indicated  otherwise.  Twenty-five  μl  of  culture  me-
dium  was  transferred  to  a  microplate  and  100μl  of 
NADH  solution  (0.3  mg/ml  NADH  and  0.1  M 
potassium  phosphate,  pH  7.4)  was  added  to  the 
medium.  Subsequently  after  2  min,  25μl  of  pyru-
vate  solution  (22.7  mM  pyruvate  and  0.1  M  pota-
ssium  phosphate,  pH  7.4)  was  added.  After  adding 
pyruvate  solution,  the  decrease  of  absorbance  at 

p38  MAPK  and  Ca2＋

340  nm,  which  indicates  the  conversion  of  NADH  to 
NAD＋,  was  measured  by  SpectraMax  microplate 
reader  (Molecular  Device,  Sunnyvale,  USA).  LDH 
activity  was  normalized  in  that  sham-treated  culture 
and  culture  showing  complete  cell  death  were  0% 
and  100%,  respectively,  and  normalized  LDH  acti-
vity  was  regarded  as  an  indicator  of  cell  death. 
Complete  cell  death  was  induced  by  treatment  of 
cells  to  2  mM  H2O2  for  24  h.  Cell  death  was  also 
confirmed  by  trypan  blue  staining,  and  by  mor-
phological  changes  on  phase  contrast  microscope.

Immunofluorescence-labeled  phalloidin  stain-
ing  of  F-actin

    Visualization  of  actin  filament  distribution  in  cells 
was  performed  as  described  previously  (Chae  et 
al.,  2006).  Cortical  cells  were  fixed  by  4%  parafor-
maldehyde  solution  for  10  min  at  room  temperature 
and  washed  in  PBS  twice.  Then  the  cells  were 
treated  with  0.5%  triton  X-100  in  PBS  to  help 
penetration  of  phalloidin.  After  being  washed,  the 
cells  were  stained  with  0.4μg/ml  phalloidin-TRITC 
(Sigma,  St  Louis,  MO,  USA)  for  90  min  at  4oC. 
Stained  cells  were  photographed  by  fluorescence 
light  microscope  (Axiovert  200,  Carl  Zeiss  Micro-
Imaging,  Inc.,  USA).

Statistical  analysis

    All  data  were  analyzed  using  Student  t-test  for 
comparisons  between  two  samples  or  using  ANOVA 
followed  by  the  Newman-Keuls  test.  A  statistical 
difference  was  accepted  at  5%  level.

RESULTS

Zinc-treated  astroglia  showed  strong  activa-
tion  of  p38  and  JNK  MAPKs

    Astroglial  cells  insulted  with  zinc  were  elongated 
in  shape  after  6  h,  then  gradually  swelled  and 
detached  from  the  bottom  of  culture  plate  after  9  h. 
The  rapid  loss  of  morphological  integrity  in  zinc- 
treated  cells  proceeded  in  parallel  with  the  cellular 
process  leading  to  cell  death  as  demonstrated  in 
previous  studies  (Cho  et  al.,  2003;  Kim  et  al., 
2003).  To  understand  the  mechanism  underlying 
the  extraordinarily  rapid  changes  in  cell’s  integrity 
and  cell  death  processes  of  zinc-treated  cells,  we 
tested  whether  p38  and  JNK  were  involved.  As

reported  previously  (Cho  et  al.,  2003;  Kim  et  al., 
2003),  zinc-dose  and  zinc-treated  time  dependent 
astroglial  deaths  were  observed  (Fig.  1A  and  B). 
Western  blot  analysis  using  anti-phospho-p38  or 
anti-phospho-JNK  showed  that  both  MAPKs  were 
activated  in  3  h  after  zinc  challenge  in  a  zinc-dose 
dependent  manner  (Fig.  1C).  The  activation  of  p38 
MAPK  by  zinc  (35μM)  was  maximal  at  ∼3  h  after 
zinc  challenge,  and  thereafter  were  slowly  declined 
(Fig.  1D).

p38  MAPK  inhibitors  suppressed  cell  mor-
phology  disruption  of  zinc-insulted  astroglia

    We  examined  whether  p38  and  JNK  MAPKs 
were  critical  players  in  zinc-induced  astroglia  death. 
Addition  of  p38  MAPK 
inhibitors,  SB202190  or 
SB203580,  in  culture  media  had  zinc-treated  astro-
glia  on  the  culture  plate  with  a  complete  attach-
ment.  Moreover,  zinc-treated  astroglia  appeared 
intact  in  the  presence  of  SB203580  when  examined 
(Fig.  2A∼D).

SB203580  (D,  H).  Photomicrographs  were  taken  24  h  after  zinc 
(35μM)-treatment  in  the  presence  of  SP600125  (20μM)  or 
SB203580  (20μM).  Scale  bar  represents  100μm.  (I)  LDH  assay

SB203580  (SB:  20μM).  LDH  assay  was  performed  24  h  after 
zinc  treatment.

SB203580-cotreated  astroglia  cells  were  strongly 
stained  by  trypan-blue  (Fig.  2E∼H),  suggesting  that 
they  were  not  alive.  Indeed,  LDH  assay  showed 
that  SB203580  and  SB202190  did  not  protect  from 
cell  death  of  zinc-treated  astroglia  (Fig.  2I).  Neither 
the  JNK  inhibitor,  SP600125,  nor  the  MEK  inhibitor, 
PD98059,  produced  protective  effects  on  zinc- 
induced  cell  death  and  cell  morphology  disruption 
(Fig.  2I;  Table  1).
    The  treatment  of  primary  astroglia  with  Cd2＋
  (10
μM)  or  H2O2  (300μM)  also  activated  p38  MAPK 
and  caused  to  cell  death  (data  not  shown).  How-

morphological  disruption  and  cell  death  of  zinc  (100

raise  the  possibility  that  SB203580-dependent  mor-

suppressed  cell  morphology  disruption  and  partially 
cell  death  of  zinc-insulted  astroglia  (Fig.  3F∼L). 
Together,  these  results  suggest  that  Ca2＋  is  im-
portant  for  the  maintenance  of  cell  morphology  of

zinc-insulted  astroglia.

Zinc  influx  disrupted  actin  filament  organiza-
tion  in  astroglia,  which  was  reversed  by  p38 
inhibitors  or  A23187

    Because  cell  morphology  of  zinc-treated  astoglia 
was  retained  in  the  presence  of  SB203580  or 
A23187,  we  extended  our  efforts  to  visualize  the 
actin  organization 
in  zinc-treated  astoglia.  Zinc- 
treated  astoglia  were  stained  with  TRITC-conjugat-
ed  phalloidin  which  labels  actin  fibers.  Microscopic 
examination  revealed  that  actin  fibers  in  untreated 
normal  astroglia  were  distributed  throughout  the 
cytoplasm,  along  with  a  mildly  preferential  localiza-
tion  at  the  plasma  membrane.  After  9∼10  h  of  zinc 
treatment,  actin  filament  distribution  in  the  cyto-
leaving  numerous 
plasm  was  disorganized  by 
patched  clumps  within  cells.  However, 
the 
presence  of  SB203580,  zinc-induced  actin  filament 
disruption  disappeared,  and 
instead  preferential 
distribution  of  actin  filament  at  the  cell  periphery 
was  strongly  reinforced,  giving  rise  to  a  distinct 
actin  filament-ring  along  the  plasma  membrane  (Fig. 
4A∼C).

tained  cell  morphology  of  zinc-insulted  astroglia 
(Fig.  3B),  we  examined  whether  A23187  stabilized 
actin 
filament  organization.  Phalloidin-staining  of 
zinc-treated  astroglia  showed  that  A23187  (0.1μM) 
protected  actin  filament  disruption  of  zinc-treated 
astroglia  so  that  the  resulting  actin  filament  dis-
tribution  was  indistinguishable  from  that  displayed 
by  untreated  astroglia.  A23187  did  not  produce 
actin-ring  formation  along  the  plasma  membrane 
(Fig.  4).
    Next,  we  tested  whether  Ca2＋
-mediated  process 
acts  over  the  p38  MAPK  pathway  in  zinc-insulted 
astroglia.  Western  blot  data  showed  that  A23187 
did  not  suppress  p38  MAPK  activation  in  zinc- 
treated  astroglia  (Fig.  5).  These  results  suggest  that 
Ca2＋
-mediated  process  is  not  in  the  up-stream  of 
p38  MAPK-mediated  process.

DISCUSSION

    The  present  study  demonstrates  that  the  Ca2＋ 
ionophore  A23187  and  the  p38  MAPK  inhibitors 
(SB203580  and  SB202190)  suppressed  rapid  cell 
morphology  disruption 
in 
zinc-treated  astroglia.  These  results  suggest  that

intensified  actin 

Ca2＋  signaling  and/or  the  p38  MAPK  pathway  are 
mechanism(s)  that  regulate  actin  filament  dynamics 
in  zinc-treated  astroglia.  A23187  produced  a  com-
pletely  protection  of  cell  morphology  and  actin-fila-
ment  stabilization  in  zinc-treated  astroglia,  whereas 
SB203580  produced  similar  stabilization  effects  with 
leaving  abnormally 
filament-ring 
formation  along  the  cell  membrane,  suggesting  that 
in  zinc-insulted  astroglia,  zinc  influx-induced  distur-
bance  of  cell  morphology  might  be  diverse.
    The  present  study  demonstrates  that  supplement 
of  Ca2＋
  into  zinc-treated  astroglia  using  the  Ca2＋
 
ionophore,  A23187,  protected  cell  morphology  dis-
ruption  of  zinc-treated  astroglia.  Therefore,  we 
speculate  that  zinc  influx  disrupts  Ca2＋
  homeostasis 
or  Ca2＋  availability  in  zinc-treated  astroglia,  which 
in  turns  affects  actin  filament  destabilization,  result-
ing  in  rapid  loss  of  the  morphological  integrity.  Dis-
ruption  of  Ca2＋  availability  or  substitution  of  Ca2＋ 
by  Zn2＋  might  affect  the  function  of  Ca2＋-depen-
dent  proteases  or  Ca2＋
  regulating  factors  such  as 
calreticulin  and  calbibdin.  For  examples,  calpains 
are  Ca2＋-dependent  proteases  that  cleave  actin- 
binding  proteins  (Harris  and  Morrow,  1990;  Carrag-
her  and  Frame,  2002).  Calreticulin  potentially  has  a 
role  in  cell  adhesion  and  maintenance  of  intra-
cellular  Ca2＋
  homeostasis  (Michalak  et  al.,  1998). 
Zinc  influx  induces  functional  disruption  of  thiol- 
containing  cellular  factors  (Frederickson  et  al.,  1988; 
Kim  et  al.,  2003)  and  increase  of  ROS  stress  (Kim 
et  al.,  1999a;  1999b;  Suh  et  al.,  2000).  Our  results 
add  the  evidence  that  zinc  influx  in  astroglia  causes 
a  disturbance  of  Ca2＋

  homeostasis.

formed  after  3  h  of  treatment  with  zinc  (40μM)  alone  or  zinc  (40
μM)＋A23187  (A:  0.1μM).

Concerning 

the  effects  of  SB203580  on  cell 
morphology  and  actin  filament  dynamics,  it  may  be 
possible  that  the  p38  MAPK  pathway  normally  plays 
an  inhibitory  role  in  actin  filament  stabilization  in 
zinc-treated  astroglia.  The  notion  that  inhibition  of 
p38  MAPK  pathway  by  SB203580  enhances  actin 
filament  stabilization  is  consistent  with  the  previous 
report  that  inhibition  of  the  p38  MAPK  pathway  by 
SB202190  facilitated  stellate  process  growth  and 
extension  of  FGF2-treated  primary  astroglia  (Heffron 
and  Mandell,  2005).  Stellate  process  extension  of 
astroglia  is  an  important  aspect  of  reactive  astro-
gliosis  that  occurs  in  a  variety  of  pathological  stimuli 
including  trauma,  ischemia,  and  neurodegenerative 
diseases  (Chen  and  Swanson,  2003;  Pekny  and 
Nilsson,  2005).  During 
the  changes  of  stellate 
process  extension  of  astroglia,  actin  filament  break-
down,  reassembly  and  stabilization  should 
take 
place  rapidly.  Consistent  with  this  view,  reactive 
astrogliosis  express  high  levels  of  p38  MAPK  (Che 
et  al.,  2001;  Piao  et  al.,  2003).  Many  brain  tumors 
arise  from  astoglia  and  metastasis  of  brain  tumors

independently  work 

may  undergo  a  phase  in  which  cell  adhesion  and 
cell  morphology  changes  are  critical  steps.  The 
results  of  the  present  study  may  raise  the  possibility 
that  the  p38  MAPK  pathway  is  an  important  regula-
tor  of  morphological  behaviors  of  brain  cells  with  an 
astroglia-origin.
    A23187  did  not  suppress  p38  MAPK  activation  in 
zinc-treated  astroglia  and  both 
factors  distinctly 
regulate  actin-filament  organization.  Therefore,  we 
speculate  that  SB203580/SB202190  target(s)  and 
Ca2＋  signaling  players 
to 
stabilize  cell  morphology.  Cell  morphology  preser-
vation  of  zinc-treated  astroglia  by  SB203580  and 
SB202190  is  likely  produced  by  stabilization  of 
actin-filament  organization  by  inhibiting  p38  MAPK. 
However,  we  do  not  rule  out  the  possibility  that 
SB203580/SB202190 
targets  unidentified  cellular 
factors  regulating  actin-filament  organization.  Our 
preliminary  data  showed  that  cell  morphology  sta-
bilization,  but  no  cell  death  protection,  of  zinc- 
treated  astroglia  can  be  also  achieved  by  NDGA 
(nordihydroguaiaretic  acid),  which  possess  a  lipoxy-
genase  (LOX)  inhibition  activity  and  an  anti-oxidant 
property  (Konno  et  al.,  1990;  Arteaga  et  al.,  2005), 
and  causes  GSH  depletion  (Im  and  Han,  2007). 
Regarding 
that  A23187,  SB202190  and  NDGA 
might  distinctly  work  within  cells,  the  possibility  that 
they  may  act  on  a  common  pathway  still  remains  to 
be  explored  further  in  the  future.
