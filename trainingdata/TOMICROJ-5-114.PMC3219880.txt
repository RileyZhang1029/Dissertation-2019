Abstract: The growth of Escherichia coli DH5(cid:2) recombinants producing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (DH5(cid:2)EPA+) and 
those not producing EPA (DH5(cid:2)EPA–) was compared in the presence of hydrophilic or hydrophobic growth inhibitors. 
The  minimal  inhibitory  concentrations  of  hydrophilic  inhibitors  such  as  reactive  oxygen  species  and  antibiotics  were 
higher for DH5(cid:2)EPA+ than for DH5(cid:2)EPA–, and vice versa for hydrophobic inhibitors such as protonophores and radical 
generators. E. coli DH5(cid:2) with higher levels of EPA became more resistant to ethanol. The cell surface hydrophobicity of 
DH5(cid:2)EPA+ was higher than that of DH5(cid:2)EPA–, suggesting that EPA may operate as a structural constituent in the cell 
membrane to affect the entry and efflux of hydrophilic and hydrophobic inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION 

  The  cell  membrane-shielding  effect  of  long-chain  poly-
unsaturated  fatty  acids  (LC-PUFAs),  such  as  eicosapen-
taenoic  acid  (EPA)  and  docosahexaenoic  acid  (DHA),  in 
bacteria  is  thought  to  occur  because  a  more  hydrophobic 
interface  is  formed  between  the  bilayers  of  cell  membrane 
phospholipids  acylated  with  a  LC-PUFA  in  combination 
with  a  medium-chain  saturated  or  mono-unsaturated  fatty 
acid, and this interface shields the  entry of hydrophilic com-

pounds  [1,  2].  We  showed  that  Escherichia  coli  cells  that 

had been transformed with EPA biosynthesis pfa genes [3, 4], 
and naturally EPA-producing Shewanella marinintestina IK-
1  (IK-1)  have  the  potential  to  prevent  the  entry  of  H2O2 
molecules through the cell membrane [1]. When these bacte-
rial cells producing EPA were  treated with H2O2, intracellu-
lar  concentrations  of  H2O2  in  these  cells  were  maintained  at 
levels  lower  than  those  in  their  reference  cells  producing  no 
EPA  [1,  4].  Thus,  the  generation  of  protein  carbonyls  was 
suppressed  to  a  lesser  extent  in  cells  with  EPA  than  in  cells 
without  EPA.  This  has  been  regarded  as  a  novel  antioxida-
tive function of PUFAs such as EPA and DHA. 

In  a  previous  study  [5],  we  used  IK-1  and  its  EPA-

 
deficient  mutant  IK-1(cid:1)8  (IK-1(cid:1)8)  to  show  that  membrane

EPA is involved in the increased hydrophobicity of bacterial 
cells  and  that  it  affects  the  entry  of  hydrophilic  and  hydro-
phobic compounds. Briefly, IK-1 and IK-1(cid:1)8 were grown on 
microtiter  plates  at  20  °C  in  nutrient  media  that  contained 
various  types  of  growth  inhibitors.  The  minimal  inhibitory 
concentrations  (MICs)  of  water-soluble  H2O2,  tert-butyl  hy-
droxyl  peroxide  (tert-BHP)  and  antibiotics  were  higher  for 
IK-1  than  for  IK-1(cid:1)8.  In  contrast,  IK-1  was  less  resistant 
than  IK-1(cid:1)8  to  two  hydrophobic  oxidative  phosphorylation 
uncouplers,  carbonyl  cyanide  m-chloro  phenyl  hydrazone 
(CCCP)  and  N,N(cid:1)-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.  The  hydropho-
bicity  of  the  IK-1  and  IK-1(cid:1)8  cells  determined  using  the 
bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon method [6] was higher for 
IK-1  cells,  which  contained  EPA  at  approximately  10%  of 
total  fatty  acids,  compared  with  their  counterparts  with  no 
EPA. From  these results, we  concluded that the high hydro-
phobicity  of  IK-1  cells  can  be  attributed  to  the  presence  of 
membrane  EPA,  which  shields  the  entry  of  hydrophilic 
membrane-diffusible  compounds,  and 
that  hydrophobic 
compounds  such  as  CCCP  and  N,N(cid:1)-dicyclohexylcar- 
bodiimide diffuse more effectively  in  the  membranes of IK-
1,  where  these  hydrophobic  compounds  can  exhibit  their 
inhibitory  activities,  than  in  the  membranes  of  IK-1(cid:1)8. 
However,  the  membrane-shielding  functions  of  LC-PUFAs 
have  not  been  reported  for  bacteria  other  than  IK-1  and  E. 
coli recombinants producing EPA or DHA. 

 
In this study, we used EPA-producing  and EPA-not pro-
ducing E.  coli DH5(cid:2) recombinants  to further investigate the 
applicability  of  the  membrane-shielding  effects  of  EPA 
against various kinds of hydrophilic and hydrophobic growth 
inhibitors,  such  as  reactive  oxygen  species  (H2O2  and  tert-
BHP), hydrophilic and hydrophobic radical generators (2,2(cid:3)-

azobis-(2-amidopropane)hydrochloride  (AAPH)  and  2,2(cid:3)-
azobis-(2,4-dimethyl)valeronitrile  (AMVN),  respectively), 
hydrophilic  antibiotics  (ampicillin  sodium,  kanamycin  sul-
fate and streptomycin sulfate), an uncoupling reagent in oxi-
dative  phosphorylation  (CCCP)  and  organic  solvent  (etha-
nol).  To  evaluate  the  relation  between  hydrophobicity  of 
each  bacterial  cell  and  the  cellular  content  of  EPA,  we  used 
the  bacterial  adhesion  to  hydrocarbon  method  [5,6]  and 
tested E. coli recombinants with various levels of EPA. 

  The  E.  coli  strain  DH5(cid:2)  was  used  as  host.  Recombinant 
cells  of E.  coli  DH5(cid:2)  (see  below)  were  cultivated  normally 
at  20°C  in  Luria–Bertani  (LB)  medium  with  shaking  at  150 
rpm  in  the  presence  of  50  μg/ml  ampicillin  and  30  μg/ml 
chloramphenicol  for  two  days.  Bacterial  strains  and  vectors 
used in this study are listed in Table 1. 

  Unless  otherwise  stated,  E.  coli  DH5(cid:2)  was  transformed 
with pEPA(cid:1)1,2,3, which is a cosmid clone that includes four 
(pfaA,  pfaB,  pfaC  and  pfaD)  of  the  five  genes  essential  for 
the biosynthesis of  EPA  and an  additional  two open reading 
frames  unnecessary  for  EPA  biosynthesis  from  Shewanella 
pneumatophori  SCRC-2738  and  a  pSTV28  plasmid  vector 
carrying  pfaE  encoding  phosphopantetheinyl  transferase 
(pSTV::pfaE); pfaE is the fifth gene needed for EPA biosyn-
thesis  from  the  same  bacterium  ([7]  and  Table  1).  The  host 
E. coli DH5(cid:2) cells that had been transformed with these two 
vectors produced  EPA  at a level of 10% of  total fatty acids, 
when  growth  at  20  ºC  [3].  The  E.  coli  DH5(cid:2)  recombinant 
reference  strain,  which  has  no  ability  to  produce  EPA,  was 
transformed  with  pEPA(cid:1)1,2,3  and  empty  pSTV28.  E.  coli 
DH5(cid:2)  with  and  without  EPA  were  designated  DH5(cid:2)EPA+ 
and  DH5(cid:2)EPA–,  respectively.  To  increase  the  content  of 
EPA,  E.  coli  DH5(cid:2)  was  transformed  with  pEPA(cid:1)1,3,4,9, 
which  is  a  pNEB  clone  containing  pfaA,  pfaB,  pfaC,  pfaD 
and  pfaE  but  no  unnecessary  open  reading  frames  from  
S.  pneumatophori  SCRC-2738  [8].  Levels  of  EPA  of  this 
recombinant, which was grown at 20 °C, were approximately 
20% of total fatty acids [9].

  To  perform  growth  inhibition  tests,  96-well  microtiter 
plates (0.35 ml per well; Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan) were used, as 
described previously [5]. Briefly, E. coli DH5(cid:2) recombinant 
cells were grown for 48 h at 20 °C. One hundred microliters 
of  these  cultures  [1.0  at  600  nm  (OD600)]  was  diluted  with 
100 ml of medium. To 180 μl of the diluted cultures, 20 μl of 
aqueous  solutions  containing  various  concentrations  of 
growth inhibitors were added. AAPH and AMVN were used 
as  hydrophilic  and  hydrophobic  radical  generators,  respec-
tively.  CCCP  was  used  as  a  hydrophobic  proton  conductor. 
To  dissolve  AMVN  and  CCCP,  absolute  ethanol  was  used. 
For AMVN and CCCP, 2 μl aliquots were mixed with 198 μl 
of 
the  plates  
were  incubated  for  four  days  at  20 °C.  Growth  of  cells  was 
monitored  visually  and  the  bottom  face  of  the  microtiter 
plates was scanned with a scanner.

inoculation, 

  To cultivate E. coli recombinants in LB medium contain-
ing ethanol, test tubes with silicon caps were used to prevent 
organic  solvent  from  volatizing.  The  OD600  of  E.  coli 
DH5(cid:2)EPA+  and  E.  coli  DH5(cid:2)EPA–  cells  precultivated  in 
LB medium, as described above, was adjusted to 1.0 with the 
same medium. One hundred microliter aliquots of the precul-
tures were mixed with 100 ml of the medium. Ten milliliters 
of  the  cultures  were  transferred  to  test  tubes.  To  these  
cultures,  ethanol  (0,  300,  500,  600,  and  700  μl)  was  added 
and  then  they  were  cultivated  with  shaking  at  150  rpm  at  
20  °C.  It  is  known  that  a  strain  of  E.  coli  grows  weekly  in 
ethanol concentrations above 6% by volume [10]. 

  The  hydrophobicities  of  cells  of  DH5(cid:1)EPA+  and 
DH5(cid:1)EPA–  were  estimated  by  the  bacterial  adhesion  to  
hydro-carbon  method  [6],  as  described  previously  [5].  
The  hydrophobicity  was  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  
the  adherence  of  cells  to  hexadecane  and  calculated  as  
100 (cid:4) (OD600 of the aqueous phase  after vortex/OD600 of the 
initial cell suspension).

Fatty  acids  of  cells  were  analyzed  as  methyl  esters  by 

 
gas–liquid chromatography, as previously described [7]. 

  The  MICs  of  H2O2  and  tert-BHP  were  both  100  μM  for 
DH5(cid:2)EPA+  and  were  both  10  μM  for  DH5(cid:2)EPA–  (Fig. 
1A).  The  MICs  of  AAPH  and  AMVN  were  10  μM  and  1 
μM,  respectively,  for  DH5(cid:2)EPA+  and  were  1  μM  and  10 
μM,  respectively,  for  DH5(cid:2)EPA–  (Fig.  1B).  The  MIC  
of  CCCP  was  1  mM  and  10  mM  for  DH5(cid:2)EPA+  and  
for  DH5(cid:2)EPA–,  respectively.  AMVN  and  CCCP  are  water-
insoluble and ethanol-soluble compounds. The final concen-
tration  of  ethanol  in  the  culture  medium  was  1%  (v/v),  and 
this  concentration  of  ethanol  had  no  effect  on  the  growth  of 
DH5(cid:2)EPA+  and  DH5(cid:2)EPA–.  DH5(cid:2)EPA+  was  much  more 
resistant to the three hydrophilic compounds, H2O2, tert-BHP 
and  AAPH,  than  was  DH5(cid:2)EPA–.  The  same  tendency  
was  observed,  when  cells  of  DH5(cid:2)EPA+  and  DH5(cid:2)EPA– 
were  treated  with  three  types  of  water-soluble  antibiotics 
including  ampicillin  sodium,  kanamycin  sulfate  and  strepto-
mycin  sulfate.  However,  DH5(cid:2)EPA+  was  more  sensitive  to 
the  hydrophobic  AMVN  and  CCCP  than  was  DH5(cid:2)EPA–. 
The results are summarized in Table 2.

  DH5(cid:2)EPA+  and  DH5(cid:2)EPA–  cells  were  cultured  in  the 
presence and in the absence of ethanol at 20 ºC. DH5(cid:2)EPA+ 
cells  grew  much  better  in  approximately  5%  ethanol  than 
DH5(cid:2)EPA–  for  seven  days  at  20  ºC  and  the  former  weakly 
grew even in approximately 6% ethanol but the latter did not 
under the same conditions. No growth was observed in both 
strains  in  7%  ethanol.  When  E.  coli  DH5(cid:2)  carrying 
pNEB(cid:1)1,3,4,9  was  grown  at  20  ºC,  cells  grew  well  in  ap-
proximately  5%  and  6%  ethanol  than  DH5(cid:2)EPA+  cells  and 
did not grow in 7% ethanol (Table 3).  

  The  bacterial  cell  surface  hydrophobicity  of  various  E. 
coli  DH5(cid:2)  recombinants  was  expressed  as  the  percentage 
adhesion of bacterial cells to water measured using the bacte-
rial adhesion to hydrocarbon method. To change the cellular 
level  of  EPA,  E.  coli  DH5(cid:2)  cells  were  transformed  by  dif-
ferent combinations of vectors carrying pfa genes and grown 
at  different  temperatures.  Levels  of  EPA  of  E.  coli  DH5(cid:2) 
cells  that  had  been  transformed  with  pEPA(cid:1)1,2,3  plus 
pSTV28::pfaE  were  16%  ±  1%,  11%  ±  1%  and  0%  of  the 
total  fatty  acids  at  15,  20  and  30  °C,  respectively.  The  cells 
transformed  with  pEPA(cid:1)1,2,3  plus  pSTV28  had  no  EPA 
(Table  4).  When  E.  coli  DH5(cid:2)  cells  were  transformed  
with  pEPA(cid:1)1,3,4,9  and  grown  at  20  ºC,  the  EPA  level  was 
21%  ±  2%.  DHA5(cid:2)  cells  with  higher  levels  of  EPA  had 
higher  cell  hydrophobicity  (lower  values;  Table  4).  The  
lowest  hydrophobicity  (highest  value)  was  98%  for  the  two 
types of E. coli DH5(cid:2) cells with no EPA: those grown at 30 
°C with pEPA(cid:1)1,2,3 plus pSTV28::pfaE and those grown at 
20 °C with pEPA(cid:1)1,2,3 plus empty pSTV28. 

  The  present  results  using  E.  coli  recombinant  cells  pro-
ducing  EPA  and  those  not  producing  EPA  were  almost  the 
same  as  the  results  using  a  native  EPA-producing  strain  S. 
marinintestina IK-1 and its EPA-deficient mutant IK-1(cid:1)8 in 
terms  of  the  resistance  and  sensitivity  to  hydrophilic  and 
hydrophobic growth inhibitors [5]. Considering that the EPA 
content of DH5(cid:2)EPA+ (a recombinant carrying pEPA(cid:1)1,2,3 
plus  pSTV::pfaE)  is  approximately  10%  of  total  fatty  acids, 
these results  can also be  explained by the hydrophobicity of 
the  EPA-containing  cell  membranes.  The  converse  results 
using  hydrophobic  compounds  as  substrate,  such  as  AMVN 
and  CCCP  (Fig.  1B  and  Table  2),  can  be  also  explained  by 
the increased cell surface hydrophobicity. AMVN and CCCP 
tend  to  accumulate  in  the  more  hydrophobic  cell  membrane 
of  DH5(cid:2)EPA+,  where  more  radicals  are  produced  by 
AMVN  and  oxidative  phosphorylation  is  inhibited  more  ef-
fectively  by  CCCP.  Since  hydrophilic  antibiotics  with  mo-
lecular  weights  less  than  about  600  pass  nonspecifically 
through  porin  channels  on  the  outer  membrane  and  not  by 
diffusion [11], streptomycin sulfate, with a molecular weight 
of  1457.4,  could  be  shielded  at  the  outer  and  inner  mem-
branes,  although  we  have  not  confirmed  the  distribution  of 
EPA in both the membranes. 

  Higher levels of EPA in E. coli DH5(cid:2) recombinants cells 
provided higher hydrophobicity of the cells (Table 4). As the 
relieving  effects  of  EPA  on  H2O2-induced  growth  inhibition 
increased  with  cellular  levels  of  EPA  [9],  it  is  considered 
that  higher  MICs  of  various  hydrophilic  growth  inhibitors 
would  be  obtained  for  cells  with  higher  cell  surface  hydro-
phobicity  and  vice  versa  for  cells  with  lower  cell  surface 
hydrophobicity.  Therefore,  the  function  of  EPA  in  recombi-
nant  E.  coli  DH5(cid:2)  cells  would  be  based  on  the  membrane-

shielding  effects  of  EPA  against  hydrophilic  compounds  
and  this  function  of  EPA  would  not  apply  to  hydrophobic 
compounds, which tend to  accumulate in  the  membranes. In 
addition  to  these  physical  effects  of  EPA,  EPA  may  have 
specific  interactions  with  proteins  involved  in  membrane 
transport, such as Omp, TolC and Acr proteins [5]. 

  E.  coli  DH5(cid:2)EPA+  grew  in  the  presence  of  higher  
concentrations  of  ethanol,  compared  to  E.  coli  DH5(cid:2)EPA– 
(Table 3). In general, the organic solvent tolerance of E. coli 
arises mainly from the AcrAB–TolC and AcrEF–TolC efflux 
pumps  [11].  The  finding  that  the  lack  of  EPA  leads  to  the 
decreased  concentrations  of  a  tentative  TolC  family  protein 
and  decreased  growth  rates  in  the  EPA-deficient  mutant  of 

Shewanella  livingstonensis  Ac10  [12]  supports  the  involve-
ment  of  TolC  protein  in  the  increased  efflux  activity  of  or-
ganic  solvents  in  DH5(cid:2)EPA+.  However,  the  relationship 
between  EPA  and  Acr  proteins  has  not  been  elucidated. 
Ethanol  is  only  slightly  less  polar  than  water  and  is  freely 
permeable  across  bacterial  membranes  [10]  and  affects,  in 
addition to proteins on  the  cell surface  and within  the mem-
branes,  cytoplasmic  enzymes  and  functions  [13].  Thus,  the 
membrane-shielding effects of EPA may primarily cause the 
resistant  mechanism  of  DH5(cid:2)EPA+  against  ethanol.  This  is 
supported  by  the  findings  that  an  E.  coli  mar  mutant  defi-
cient  in  multiple  antibiotics  resistance  and  an acrAB  mutant 
display the same tolerance to simple alcohols as their parents 
[14].

a Values are average ± standard deviation of three independent measurements. 
b Hydrophobicity is expressed as the percentage adhesion of bacterial cells to water; lower values show higher hydrophobicity of cells. 
c pEPA(cid:1)1,2,3 + pSTV::pfaE and pEPA(cid:1)1,2,3 + pSTV are DH5(cid:1)EPA+ and DH5(cid:1)EPA–, respectively. 
d Not detected. 

 
It is worth noting that there is a close relation between an 
improvement  of  organic  solvent  tolerance  and  resistance  to 
multiple  antibiotics  in  E.  coli  [15].  This  is  in  line  with  the 
finding that the presence of EPA in E. coli confers resistance 
against  antibiotics  (Table  2)  and  ethanol  (Table  3).  It  is  
conceivable  that  the  common  efflux  pumping  systems  are 
involved  in  the  resistance  against  antibiotics  and  organic 
solvents in E. coli systems including DH5(cid:2)EPA+. 

  Based on the present and previous studies [1-5, 9], it has 
become evident  that bacterial EPA (and probably DHA) has 
functions  other  than  that  to  modulate  the  membrane  fluidity 
in the cold adaptation.
