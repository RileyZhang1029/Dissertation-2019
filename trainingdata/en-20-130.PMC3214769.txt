We previously demonstrated that repeated exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) increases locomotor 
activity via stimulation of dopaminergic D1 receptor (J. Pharmacol. Sci., 2007;105:367-371). Since it has been demonstrated 
that activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors, especially 35-kDa fos-related antigen (FRA), play a key role in the neuronal 
and behavioral adaptation in response to various stimuli, we examined whether repeated ELF-MF exposure induces FRA-
immunoreactivity (FRA-IR) in the striatum and nucleus accumbens (striatal complex) of the mice. Repeated exposure to ELF-
MF (0.3 or 2.4 mT, 1 h/day, for consecutive fourteen days) significantly induced hyperlocomotor activity and FRA-IR in the striatal 
complex in a field intensity-dependent manner. ELF-MF-induced FRA-IR lasted for at least 1 year, while locomotor activity 
returned near control level 3 months after the final exposure to ELF-MF. Pretreatment with SCH23390, a dopaminergic D1 receptor 
antagonist, but not with sulpiride, a dopaminergic D2 receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated hyperlocomotor activity and 
FRA-IR induced by ELF-MF. Our results suggest that repeated exposure to ELF-MF leads to prolonged locomotor stimulation and 
long-term expression of FRA in the striatal complex of the mice via stimulation of dopaminergic D1 receptor.

Long-lasting FRA Induced by ELF-MF

DNA sequences (5’-TGAGTCA-3’) in the promoter regions of 
a number of genes (Pennypacker et al., 1994; Karin et al., 1997). 
Temporal expression profiles of each member of the Fos family, 
including c-Fos (Young et al., 1991; Rosen et al., 1994; Hsieh et 
al., 2002), FosB (Chen et al., 1995; Doucet et al., 1996; Bing et al., 
1997a), ΔFosB (Chen et al., 1995; Doucet et al., 1996) and fos-
related antigen (FRA) (Young et al., 1991; Rosen et al., 1994; Bing 
et al., 1997a and 1997b; Pennypacker et al., 2000; Hsieh et al., 
2002) have been characterized in various in vivo animal models. 
In particular, a 35-kDa FRA have shown long-lasting expression 
pattern in response to chronic drug treatment or chronic neuronal 
stimulation (Rosen et al., 1994; Bing et al., 1997a and 1997b; Hsieh 
et al., 2002), suggesting that prolonged induction of 35-kDa FRA 
is important for regulating genes related to neuronal adaptation 
(Pennypacker et al., 1994; Pennypacker et al., 1995; Foletta, 1996; 
Bing et al., 1997b). We also have demonstrated the induction of 
35-kDa FRA after treatment with kainic acid (Kim et al., 1996; 
Kim et al., 1998), cocaine (Jhoo et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2001), or 
methamphetamine (Shin et al., 2005). 
Magnetic fields have shown to affect behavioral profiles 
regulated by dopaminergic system (Wilson, 1988; Choleris et al., 
2001; Sieroń et al., 2004; Janać et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2007; Liu 
et al., 2008) in rodents. In the previous study, we demonstrated 
that exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-
MF) increases striatal dopamine levels (Lee et al., 2001), and that 
ELF-MF induces hyperlocomotor activity via dopaminergic D1 
receptor stimulation (Shin et al., 2007). 
Little is known about the role of magnetic fields in modulations 
of AP-1 transcription factors in vivo, although magnetic fields-
induced up-regulations in AP-1 transcription factors have 
demonstrated in vitro (Lin et al., 1998; Hirai et al., 2002). Since 
FRA is the most important factor of the AP-1 modulation of 
genes necessary for neuronal adaptation (Pennypacker et al., 
1995; Bing et al., 1996; Bing et al., 1997b), we examined FRA-
immunoreactivity (FRA-IR) in the striatum and nucleus 
accumbens (striatal complex) after ELF-MF exposure, and 
we evaluated whether dopaminergic receptors are involved in 
the induction of FRA by applying dopaminergic D1 receptor 
antagonist, SCH 233390 and dopaminergic D2 receptor 
antagonist, sulpiride. Unexpectedly, we observed that FRA-IR 
lasted for at least 1 year after final exposure to ELF-MF. This long-
lasting FRA-IR requires activation of dopaminergic D1 receptor. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals and treatments
All mice were handled in accordance with the US National 

Institute of Health guidelines for the humane care of laboratory 
animals and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of 
Kangwon National University. Male adult C57BL/6 mice (Orient 
Bio Inc., Charles River Technology, Gapyung-Gun, Gyeonggi-Do, 
Korea), weighing 25±2 g, were maintained on a 12:12 h light:dark 
cycle, with food and water available ad libitum. The ambient 
conditions were maintained at 20±2°C. Mice were adapted to 
these conditions for 2 weeks before the experiments.
The ELF-MF was generated with three Helmholtz coils, set 
parallel to each other, in a wooden frame (Lee et al., 2001; Shin et 
al., 2007). The ELF-MF consisted of 60-Hz time-varying fields and 
the magnetic flux density was 0.3 or 2.4 mT. Animals were exposed 
to ELF-MF for 1 h/day for fourteen days. As seven days’ exposure 
to ELF-MF was not fully enough for locomotor stimulation (Shin 
et al., 2007), we extended exposure period by fourteen days in this 
study. Thirty minutes before the animals were exposed to ELF-
MF, mice were treated with SCH23390 hydrochloride (SCH, D1 
antagonist; Tocris Co., Ellisville, MO, USA) at 0.03 or 0.1 mg/kg, 
i.p. or (RS)-(±) sulpiride (Sulp, D2 antagonist; Tocris Co.) at 10 or 
20 mg/kg, i.p. (Shin et al., 2007). Locomotor activity was measured 
0 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 3 months or 1 year after the final ELF-MF 
exposure using an automated video-tracking system (Noldus 
Information Technology, Wagenin, The Netherlands). Eight test 
boxes (40×40×30 cm high) were operated simultaneously by a 
computer. Animals were studied individually during locomotion 
in the test box. A printout for each session showed the pattern 
of ambulatory movements in the test box. The distance traveled 
(in cm) was analyzed for 30 min. Data were collected and 
analyzed between 9:00 and 17:00 h. Animals were sacrificed for 
immunohistochemical analyses 90 min after measurement of 
locomotor activity. 

Immunohistochemistry
Sections containing the nucleus accumbens and striatum were 
processed for FRA immunohistochemistry. Prior to incubation 
with the primary antibody, sections were preincubated in PBS 
containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 4% normal goat serum 
for 20 min. After 48-h incubation with the primary antibody 
against FRA (1 : 2,000, Young et al., 1991; Bing et al., 1996; Kim 
et al., 2001) at 4°C, sections were incubated with the secondary 
biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 1,000; Vector Laboratories, Inc., 
Burlingame, CA, USA) for 1 h, and immersed in avidin-biotin-
peroxidase complex (ABC Kits; Vector Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 
h. 3,3’-Diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogen. Digital 
images of FRA-immunoreactive neurons were acquired on an 
Olympus microscope (Tokyo, Japan), using an attached digital 
microscope camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and a personal

computer. A region of interest (ROI), having an area of 0.1 mm2, 
was created using Optimas (version 6.51; Media Cybernetics, Inc., 
Silver Spring, MD, USA). Cell counting was performed blindly 
by two investigators and their results were averaged. Results are 
indicated as the number of FRA-immunoreactive cells /0.1 mm2.

Statistics
Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and 
Post-hoc Fisher’s PLSD test was followed for the comparison 
among groups. A p value less than 0.05 was deemed to be 
statistically significant.

RESULTS

Experimental schedules are shown in Fig. 1. Control mice 
showed a basal locomotor activity (Fig. 2). Locomotor activity 
was significantly increased immediately after the final exposure 
to ELF-MF in a field intensity-dependent manner, and it remains 
elevated 1 week later (0 hour and 1 day: Saline+0.3 or 2.4 mT 
vs. Saline+Control, p<0.05 or p<0.01; 1 week: Saline+2.4 mT vs. 
Saline+Control, p<0.05). However, locomotor activity returned 
near control level 3 months after the final exposure to ELF-MF. 
ELF-MF-induced hyperlocomotor activity was significantly 
attenuated by treatment with SCH23390, a dopaminergic D1 
receptor antagonist in a dose-related manner [0 hour: SCH23390 
(0.1 mg/kg)+2.4 mT vs. Saline+2.4 mT, p<0.01; 1 day: SCH23390 
(0.03 or 0.1 mg/kg)+2.4 mT vs. Saline+2.4 mT, p<0.05 or p<0.01; 1 
week: SCH23390 (0.1 mg/kg)+2.4 mT vs. Saline+2.4 mT, p<0.05]. 
However, dopaminergic D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride did not 
significantly alter hyperlocomotor activity induced by ELF-MF 
(Fig. 2).
FRA-immunoreactive cells were barely observed in the striatal 
complex of the control (Fig. 3 and 4). Repeated exposure to ELF-
MF significantly increased FRA-IR in the striatal complex 2 hours 

after the final exposure in a field intensity-dependent manner, 
and this FRA induction lasted for 1 year (both of striatum and 
nucleus accumbens at 2 hours, 1 day, 1week, 3 months and 1 
year: Saline+0.3 or 2.4 mT vs. Saline+Control, p<0.01). Treatment 
with SCH23390 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated the 
ELF-MF-induced increase in FRA-IR in the striatum [0 hour, 1 
day and 1week: SCH23390+2.4 mT vs. Saline+2.4 mT, p<0.01; 
3 months and 1 year: SCH23390+2.4 mT vs. Saline+2.4 mT, 
p<0.05] and nucleus accumbens [0 hour, 1 day, 1week and 3 
months: SCH23390+2.4 mT vs. Saline+2.4 mT, p<0.01; 1 year: 
SCH23390+2.4 mT vs. Saline+2.4 mT, p<0.05], while sulpiride (20 
mg/kg, i.p.) did not significantly affect FRA-IR induced by ELF-

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that repeated 
exposure to ELF-MF produces nearly permanent induction of 
FRA in the striatal complex in vivo. Elevated FRA-IR lasted for 
at least 1 year after final exposure to ELF-MF in the present study. 
A number of studies have suggested that transient and short-
term expression of FRA proteins is a marker of extracellular 
stimuli (Nguyen et al., 1992; Bing et al., 1997b; Deutch et al., 
1998), while long-term expression of FRA mediates neuronal 
adaptation through the persistent activation of the AP-1 binding 
site in the nucleus (Bing et al., 1996 and 1997b; Pennypacker et 
al., 2000). AP-1 binding sites are located in the promoter regions 
of various genes, including tyrosine hydroxylase, proenkephalin, 

prodynorphin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (Pennypacker 
et al., 1994; Nakashima et al., 2003). Among these genes, 
proenkephalin- and prodynorphin-gene expressions have shown 
temporal correlation with long-lasting expressions of 35-kDa FRA 
induced by psychostimulants (Bronstein et al., 1996; Shin et al., 
2005) or kainate (Bing et al, 1997b; Kim et al., 1998). Enkephalin 
and dynorphin, which are derived from proenkephalin precursor 
and prodynorphin precursor, respectively, have been suggested 
to play an important role in the neuroadaptive responses related 
to behavioral sensitization, drug reward, drug withdrawal, 
or recovery of motor function via modulating post-synaptic 
dopaminergic receptor sensitivity or pre-synaptic dopamine 
release (Steiner and Gerfen, 1998; Bruijnzeel, 2009). Moreover, 
it has been reported that exposure to magnetic fields increases 
prodynorphin gene expression (Ventura et al., 2000) and regulates 
the activity of opioid receptors (Thomas et al., 1997). Therefore,

it may be possible that proenkephalin- and prodynorphin-genes 
may be involved in the neuroadaptive responses mediated by 
long-term FRA expression in response to ELF-MF, although the 
role and physiological significance of the long-term expression of 
FRA induced by ELF-MF remain to be further clarified. 
In the present study, ELF-MF-induced long-lasting FRA 
expression in the striatal complex was attenuated by SCH23390, a 
dopaminergic D1 antagonist, but not by sulpiride, a dopaminergic 
D2 antagonist, suggesting that ELF-MF induces long-lasting FRA-
IR via stimulation of dopaminergic D1 receptor. These results are 
in line with previous findings showing that direct stimulation of 
D1 receptor with specific agonist (Wirtshafter, 2007) or indirect 
stimulation of D1 receptor with psychostimulants (Young et al., 
1991; Bronstein et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 2002) augments FRA 
expression in the striatal complex. Especially, it has been suggested 
that dopaminergic D1 receptor-mediated adenylate cyclase 
signaling pathway, but not phospholipace C pathway, is necessary 
for inducing FRA in the striatum (Wirtshafter, 2007). Although 
it is not clear how ELF-MF stimulates dopaminergic D1 receptor, 
it has been reported that ELF-MF exposure alters intracellular 
Ca2+ levels and facilitates releases of neurotransmitters (Blackman 
et al., 1991; Sandyk, 1994). Thus, there is a possibility that ELF-
MF might increase dopamine release into the synaptic cleft 
through the modulation of Ca2+ influxes. In addition, elevation in 
dopamine level in the striatum after repeated exposure to ELF-MF 
has reported (Lee et al., 2001; Sieroń et al., 2004). However, Janać 
et al. (2009) indicated that ELF-MF does not change the affinity 
and density of striatal dopaminergic receptor. In their study (Janać 
et al., 2009), rats were fully exposed to ELF-MF for up to 7 days, 
whereas mice were exposed to ELF-MF for consecutive 14 days 
in our present study. Since it has been suggested that ELF-MF-
induced change in neuronal activity and behaviors may be affected 
by exposing schedule (Lyskov et al., 1993), it requires further study 
to achieve better understanding on the discrepancy between Janać 
et al. (2009) and current finding. 
In the behavioral evaluation, locomotor activity was increased 
after repeated exposure to ELF-MF, and it returned near control 
level 3 months later. ELF-MF-induced hyperlocomotor activity 
was also attenuated by dopaminergic D1 antagonist, SCH23390. 
Although locomotor activity can not fully support time-dependent 
pattern in FRA in the striatal complex, we raise the possibility that 
FRA expression modulates, at least in part, behavioral responses 
to repeated ELF-MF exposure. It has been reported that induction 
of 35-kDa FRA is accompanied with behavioral changes during 
repeated treatment with psychostimulants, such as cocaine (Rosen 
et al., 1994; Hiroi et al., 1997) or amphetamine (Turgeon et al., 
1997). Striatal expression of 35-kDa FRA and hyperlocomotor 

activity after repeated treatment with cocaine or amphetamine 
have shown to be more pronounced than those after single 
injection (Hiroi et al., 1997; Turgeon et al., 1997), suggesting that 
35-kDa FRA plays a key role in repeated neuronal stimulation. In 
addition, Hsieh et al. (2002) reported that elevated 35-kDa FRA 
expression, but not c-Fos expression, is sustained for at least 40 
days after withdrawal from repeated amphetamine administration, 
while locomotor activity returned near control level 10 days after 
withdrawal, suggesting that 35-kDa FRA plays a certain role in 
neurobehavioral adaptation. 
Our results suggest that repeated exposure to ELF-MF induces 
prolonged locomotor stimulation and long-term expression of 
FRA in the striatal complex via stimulation of dopaminergic 
D1 receptor. Finally, we raise the possibility that ELF-MF-
mediated dopaminergic activations can be one of the therapeutic 
interventions for improving Parkinson’s symptoms.
