The anti-allodynic effect of NMDA receptor antagonist and acupuncture treatments were explored through spinal p35 regulation of 
diabetic neuropathic rat. We evaluated the change over time of p35/p25 protein levels in the spinal cord compared with behavioral 
responses to thermal and mechanical stimulation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Additionally, we studied p35 expression 
when electroacupuncture (EA) and a sub-effective dose of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist (MK-801) were 
used to treat hyperalgesia in the diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP). Thermal paw withdrawal latency (PWL) and mecha nical paw 
with drawal threshold (PWT) were significantly decreased in the early stage of diabetes in rats. p35 expression after STZ injection 
gradually decreased from 1 week to 4 weeks compared to normal controls. p25 expression in 4-week diabetic rats was significantly 
higher than that of 2-week diabetic rats, and thermal PWL in 4-week diabetic rats showed delayed responses to painful thermal sti-
mu lation compared with those at 2 weeks. EA applied to the SP-9 point (2 Hz frequency) significantly prevented the thermal and 
mechanical hyperalgesia in the DNP rat. Additionally, EA combined with MK-801 prolonged anti-hyperalgesia, increased p35 
expression, and decreased the cleavage of p35 to p25 during diabetic neuropathic pain. In this study we show EA combined with a 
sub-effective dose of MK-801 treatment in DNP induced by STZ that is related to p35/p25 expression in spinal cord.

partially effective, clinical studies have reported the difficulty of 
managing pain caused by these neuropathies (Sindrup and Jensen, 
1999). Although N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors 
antagonists are highly effective in reducing neuropathic pain, these 
agents cause severe side effects at therapeutic doses, which limit 
their clinical uses (Chen et al., 2009). The activation of NMDA 
receptors and the influx of Ca2+ into the postsynaptic cells through 
the receptor are important for the induction of long-term synaptic 
plasticity, including long-term potentiation (Li et al., 2001). The 
impairment of synaptic plasticity in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced 
diabetic rats can be linked to an inappropriate level of NMDA 
receptor stimulation required for the induction phase of long-term

Diabetic neuropathic pain and p35
It is well known that the p35 plays a pivotal role in the nervous 
system. However, the underlying mechanism of neuropathic 
hypoalgesia remains poorly understood. The peripheral 
inflammation has been resulted in the cleavage of p35 to p25, 
which forms a more stable complex with cyclin-dependent 
kinase 5 (Cdk5) (Pareek et al., 2006). p35/p25 are prominently 
expressed in primary sensory and dorsal horn neurons of adult 
rats, and p35/p25-associated Cdk5 kinase activity in primary 
sensory and dorsal horn neurons increased following complete 
Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) treatment (Yang et al., 2007). Activation 
of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in nociceptive 
neurons leads to pain hypersensitivity (Daulhac et al., 2006; Tsuda 
et al., 2008), and Cdk5/p35 is involved in altering the MAPK 
pathway (Sharma et al., 2002). Moreover the NMDA receptor and 
P/Q type voltage-dependent calcium channel (Li et al., 2001) are 
also phosphorylated by CDK5 and control calcium influx during 
sensation of pain (Petrenko et al., 2003). 
In the present study, we identified the expression of p35 in the 
spinal dorsal horn according to allodynia development and cha-
racterized whether p35 could be a target molecule for synergistic 
treatment of an NMDA antagonist with electroacupuncture (EA). 
Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that synergic treatment with 
an NMDA antagonist along with electroacupuncture produces 
analgesic effects greater than either agent alone in a maintained 
diabetic neuropathic pain phase, and we identified alterations in 
p35 level in response to analgesic effects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Laboratory animals
Experiments were performed on young adult male Sprague-
Dawley rats (300~320 g, Koatech, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea). 
Animals were housed in groups of two in plastic cages with 
soft bedding and were provided free access to food and water 
under a 12/12 hour (h) reversed light-dark cycle. All animals 
were acclimated for 7 days before the experiment began. Animal 
experiments were carried out in accordance with the National 
Institute of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals, and experimental procedures were approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Korea 
Institute of Oriental Medicine.

Induction of diabetes
Experimental diabetes was induced in rats by a single injection of 

Combined Effects of EA and MK-801 in DNP

STZ solution (50 mg/kg, i.v.) into the tail vein. STZ was prepared 
in saline (0.9% NaCl adjusted to pH 4.0 with hydrochloric acid) 
on ice; the solution was discarded if bubbling was noted. Age-
matched control rats for behavioral experiments received an equal 
volume of saline. We began checking blood sugar levels 48 hours 
after injections using a blood glucometer (Accu-check Active; 
Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Rats with values of > 400 
mg/dl were considered hyperglycemic and were included in the 
experimental group (Chen et al., 2009).

Behavioral studies
Thermal Allodynia: The Hargreaves test (Hargreaves et al., 1988) 
was used to determine the presence of thermal hyperalgesia by 
measuring foot withdrawal latency to heat stimulation. Each rat 
was placed in a PlexiglasⓇ cubicle box (17´22´14 cm) on the glass 
platform and acclimated for 10 minutes before heat stimulation. 
The temperature of the glass was measured and maintained at 
25±1oC. A heat source (IITC Life Science, CA) was focused to the 
plantar side of the hind-paw, which was flush against the glass, and 
a radiant thermal stimulus was delivered to that site. The latency in 
seconds from the start of heat application until the animal’s escape 
(or after 20 sec. to prevent tissue damage) from the heat stimulus 
was recorded as paw withdrawal latency (PWL). Paw withdrawal 
latency was measured to the nearest 0.01 second (sec). 
The intensity of the heat stimulus was maintained at a constant 
level throughout all experiments. The elicited paw movement 
occurred at a latency of approximately 9~12 sec in control rats. 
In the preliminary experiments, the intensity of radiant heat 
was set at 20%, and the latency readings were very variable. The 
intensity was later adjusted to 40% to obtain more consistent 
latency readings. The testing was repeated 3 times in 1 animal 
with an interval of 5 minutes between each application. After the 
test, animals were returned to their respective cages. Before STZ 
injection, the animals were acclimated to the apparatus for 1 week 
and then tested to establish a baseline reference for post-STZ 
injection readings. Measurements of threshold to heat stimulus 
were conducted at 3, 5, and 7 days and 2, 3, and 4 weeks after 
STZ or saline injection in all groups. For the rats receiving EA 
treatments after pretreatment with NMDA receptor antagonists, 
postoperative tests were conducted 2, 4, and 6 hours after EA 
treatment. 
Mechanical allodynia: The sensitivity to touch stimuli was asse-
ssed by using the dynamic plantar aesthesiometer (Ugo Basile, 
Varese, Italy), an automated apparatus based on the von Frey 
filament principle. Rats were placed in Plexiglas cubicles on a wire 
mesh platform (17´22´14 cm) for 10 minutes to acclimatize, a 
stimulating probe was positioned under their hind paw, and an

increasing vertical force (continuous increase from 0 to 50 g in 10 
sec) was applied to the paw. The instrument registered the force 
intensity that triggered limb withdrawal, and the mean of three 
readings was used as the tolerance threshold. Measurements of 
threshold to mechanical stimulus and postoperative tests were 
conducted in the same manner as those of heat stimulus. We used 
2 weeks-rats after STZ-treatment for EA or/and MK-801 treated 
experimental animal.

EA stimulation 
EA was applied to the acupuncture points SP9 or ST36 with a 
pair of bipolar stimulation electrodes after placing the rats under 
isoflurane anesthesia (in a flow of a mixture of oxygen and nitrous 
oxide; 3% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance). Two stainless 
steel acupuncture needles (0.15 mm diameter; DB needle CO, 
LTD. Korea) were mounted in a holder with 1-mm separation 
between the tips. The needle set was vertically inserted to a depth 
of 4 mm (cutaneous and muscle) at the SP9 or ST36 point. These 
two sites are equivalent to known human acupuncture points: 
the SP9 (‘Yinlingquan’) and ST36 (‘Zusanli’) which are terms 
designated by the World Health Organization (1993). The SP9 
point is located in the inferior border of the medial condyle of the 
tibia, in the depression between the posterior border of the tibia 
and gastrocnemius muscle on the medial leg. The ST36 point is 
located one fingerbreadth lateral to the tibia’s anterior crest, 9.0909 
cm (3 cun : 1 cun = 3.0303 cm) inferior to ST 35 in the depression 
to the lateral side of the patella on the leg. Electrical stimulation 
was performed using a Pulse Generator PG-306 (Suzuki Iryoki Co. 
Japan) connected to the pair of needle electrodes. Biphasic pulse 
electrical stimuli 0.25 ms width with 2- or 120-Hz frequencies 
were applied at an intensity of the muscle twitch threshold (the 
muscle twitch threshold was about 0.01 mA) to the acupuncture 
point. The current delivered was monitored at all times, and the 
total duration of EA stimulation was 30 min. After the termination 
of EA, anesthesia was immediately discontinued, and the rats 
usually resumed full activity within 5 min.

Western immunoblotting analysis
Rats were deeply anesthetized by pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.) 
and perfused transcardially with 150 ml of phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS; composition in mM: NaCl 137, KCl 2.7, KH2PO4 1.5, 
NaH2PO4 8.1; pH 7.4). We removed L4, L5, and L6 segments of 
the lumbar spinal cord and prepared specimens of dorsal horn area 
separated from ventral area of lumbar spinal cord. As spinal dorsal 
horn, but not ventral area, is mainly res pon si ble for pain transmission. 
The spinal dorsal horn was me cha nically homogenized in 400 ml 
of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM 

EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) con taining protease inhibitors (10 mg/
ml of aprotinin, 1 mmol/l PMSF and 10 mg/ml of leupeptin), 
agitated at 4°C for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm 
at 4°C for 30 min. The protein concentration of tissue lysates 
was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Interchim, Paris, 
France). Proteins were size fractionated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel at 
120 V for 2 h. After electrophoresis, pro teins were transferred onto 
a nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Whatman GmbH) at 200 
mA for 120 min using the Bio-Rad trans fer system. Membranes 
were blocked with Tris-buffered saline buffer (TBS), pH 7.4, 
and 5% skimmed milk, then incu ba ted overnight at 4oC with 
rat monoclonal anti-p35 (1 : 1,000 di lution, Santa Cruz, USA), 
or mouse anti-alpha-tubulin (1 : 5,000, AbCAM, Cambridge, 
UK) in TBS. Alpha-tubulin was used as an internal control. The 
membrane was then washed for 30 min in a shaking bath, with 
the wash buffer (TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20) changed 
every 10 min. The membranes were sub sequently incubated with 
a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (1 : 1,000, BD 
Transduction Laboratories) or rabbit (1 : 1,000 dilution, Santa 
Cruz, USA) IgG antibody for 1 h at room tem perature. The washes 
were repeated before the membrane was developed with a light-
emitting, nonradioactive method using ECL reagent (Amersham 
Inc., Buckinghamshire, UK). The membrane was then subjected 
to autoluminography for 1~5 min using the LAS-3000 imaging 
system (Fuji- film, Tokyo, Japan). The relative optical densities of 
the respective bands were quantified by densitometric scanning of 
the blots using the LAS-3000 imaging system.

Drugs and intrathecal administration. 
Intrathecal injections of MK-801 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) or 
vehicle (saline) were performed under isoflurane anesthesia (4% 
induction, 2% maintenance), as described previously (Mestre et 
al., 1994). In brief, the anesthetized rat was held in one hand by 
the pelvic girdle, and a 30-gauge, 1.25-inch needle connected to a 
10 μl Hamilton syringe was inserted into the subarachnoid space 
between lumbar vertebrae L5 and L6 until a tail-flick was elicited. 
The syringe was held in position for few seconds after the injection 
of a volume of 10 μl/rat. Intrathecal injection of vehicle had no 
effect on nociceptive thresholds/behavior, protein expression and 
protein phosphorylation. We tested the effective dose (0.001, 0.005, 
0.01 mg/rat, n=3) of MK-801 to hyperalgesia, and 0.005 mg/rat 
was determined to be a sub-effective dose.

RESULTS

Thermal/mechanical-hyperalgesia  and  spinal  p35 
expression in a rat model of STZ-induced diabetes
In rats that had been injected intravenously with STZ (50 mg/
kg) to remove pancreatic β cells and induce insulin deficiency, 
the concentration of blood glucose was markedly increased 
on day 3 (405.5±10.48 mg/dl, p<0.001) and remained stable 
through the fourth week recorded. In contrast, saline-injected 
animals maintained normal blood glucose levels (115.1±3.4 mg/
dl) that did not differ from baseline levels (Fig. 1A). Thermal 
paw withdrawal latency (PWL) in diabetic rats significantly 
decreased at 3 (6.7±0.46 sec) to 21 (6.72±0.65 sec) days after the 

Combined Effects of EA and MK-801 in DNP

STZ treatment, but PWL was prolonged on 4 weeks compared 
with those on 2 week diabetic mice. Mechanical paw withdrawal 
threshold decreased gradually from day 3 (31.3±2.4 g, p<0.05), 
with the maximum decrease reached around day 5 (25.5±3.1 g, 
p<0.001). The diabetes-induced mechanical hyperalgesia persisted 
until at least the fourth week that we recorded. 

Time course of changes in p35/p25 protein level in STZ-
diabetic spinal cord dorsal horn
Immunoblot (Fig. 2A) and quantification (Fig. 2B) analysis 
demonstrated the expression of p35 and its cleavage form p25 at 
2, 3, and 4 weeks after STZ injection. p35 expression after STZ 
injection gradually decreased from 1 week (70.05±2.05%) to 4 
weeks (58.6±7.07%) compared to normal controls. p25 expression 
was significantly higher in 4-week diabetic rats than in 2-week 
diabetic rats. Controls were age-matched normal rats compared 
with STZ-injected rats, and the quantification of the controls was 
indicated by the sum of the control blot from 1 week to 4 weeks. 

EA-induced analgesic effects on DNP
EA treatment at the SP9 acupoint with electrical stimulation (2-
Hz frequency) significantly attenuated both thermal (7.8±0.34 
sec) and mechanical (41.83±1.22 g) hyperalgesia compared to the 
no-treatment DNP group (thermal: 5.69±0.39 sec, mechanical:

frequency electrical stimulation (33.21±2.51 g) also significantly 
alleviated mechanical hyperalgesia (Fig. 3A, C). 
EA treatment with 2-Hz frequency electrical stimulation at the 
SP9 acupoint significantly attenuated both thermal (7.8±0.34 
sec) and mechanical (41.83±1.22 g) hyperalgesia compared to 
the 120-Hz frequency treatment groups (thermal: 5.36±0.22 sec, 
mechanical: 26.86±0.67 g) (Fig. 3B, D). The analgesic effects of EA 
treatment were at the maximum in the 2 hours after EA treatment. 

Activation of p35 contributes to analgesic effects by EA 
combined with MK-801 treatment in DNP
The combined treatment consisting of EA and a sub-effective 
dose of MK-801 (0.005 mg) alleviated thermal hyperalgesia 
(8.94±0.47 sec) compared to the DNP control (5.52±0.27 sec) 
or 0.005 mg MK-801 treatment (5.55±0.14 sec) groups at 2 
hours after treatments (Fig. 4A). In the mechanical stimulation 
experiments, the EA and sub-effective dose (0.005 mg MK-
801) combined treatment (40.75±1.09 g) significantly alleviated 
hyperalgesia compared to DNP control (24.47±1.04 g) or 0.005 
MK-801 treatment (22.14±0.9 g) groups at 2 hours after treatments 

(Fig. 4B). The analgesic effects of the EA and sub-effective MK-
801 dose combination treatment were significantly sustained to 
4 hours after treatments and showed as much analgesia as the 
effective dose (0.01 mg MK-801). 
Immunoblots (Fig. 4C) and quantification (Fig. 4D) analysis 
demonstrated the expression of p35 and its cleavage form p25 
at 2 hours after treatment. P35 expression levels in the 0.01 mg 
MK-801 (94±8.6%) or MK-801 and EA synergetic (101.4±4.59%) 
treatment groups were increased compared to the DNP group in 
0.01 mg MK-801 (94±8.6%) or 0.005 mg MK-801 (101.4±4.59%) 
treatment groups. p25 expression was significantly increased in 
DNP (126.22±3.68%), 0.005 mg MK-801 (132.47±7.59%), and 
0.01 mg MK-801 (137.47±10.23%) treatment groups. The p25 
expression level in the EA and sub-effective dose (0.005 mg MK-
801) combined treatment group (105.63±4.2%) was significantly 
lower than both MK-801 single treatment groups (0.01 mg and 
0.005 mg MK-801).

DISCUSSION 

Diabetic neuropathic pain model 
Our results showed the depression of p35 expression until 4 
weeks after STZ injection and p35 cleavage to p25 at 4 weeks after 
STZ injection. Expression of p25, a cleavage product of p35, was 
significantly higher in 4-week diabetic rats than of 2-week diabetic 
rats. Also, the thermal paw withdrawal latency in 4-week diabetic 
rats showed delayed responses to painful thermal stimulation 
compared with those of 2-week diabetic rats. Some articles have 
shown hypoalgesia to heat stimulation in the early phase (1~2 
weeks after streptozotocin) of streptozotocin-induced diabetic 
neuropathic pain. However, these studies used mice (Ohsawa et al., 
2008) or a different injection method of streptozotocin (Malcangio 
and Tomlinson, 1998; Morgado and Tavares, 2007). Our results 
provide further evidence that thermal hypoalgesia in diabetic rat 
may develop with decreased p35 expression and cleavage of p35 to 
p25. It could be related to p35 cleavage to p25 at 4 weeks of DNP 
treatment, and CDK activity and calpain-mediated p35 cleavage 
in DNP conditions remain to be elucidated.
In rodents, single intra-venous injection of streptozotocin 

(STZ), a toxin selective for pancreatic β cells, induces a short-term 
insulin-deficient diabetes and neuropathy. This model follows 
some of the criteria that define neuropathic pain: hyperalgesia 
to thermal and mechanical noxious stimuli (Jagodic et al., 2007; 
Sugimoto et al., 2008; Tsuda et al., 2008). Additionally three days 
after streptozotocin treatment, there is increased phosphorylation 
of tau, which is one of the hallmark pathological characteristics 
of Alzheimer’s disease and could be caused by the activation of 
multiple kinases (Clodfelder-Miller et al., 2006). The conversion 
of p35 to p25 translated into elevated and mislocalized CDK5 
activity, hyperphosphorylation of the neurofilament and tau 
proteins, cytoskeletal disruption, and neuronal death (Dhavan and 
Tsai, 2001). It has recently been published that p35 participated 
in the regulation of nociceptive signaling, and the expression of 
p35 is up-regulated in nociceptive neurons during peripheral 
inflammation (Pareek et al., 2006; Utreras et al., 2009). p35 
knockout mice (p35-/-) showed delayed responses to painful 
thermal simulation compared with WT controls, and mice 
overexpressing p35 were more sensitive to painful thermal stimuli 
than controls (Pareek and Kulkarni, 2006). The formation of 
p25 was detected as early as 3 hours after carrageenan-induced

peripheral inflammation, and p35 protein levels were apparently 
increased because of induced inflammation (Pareek et al., 2006).

Diabetic neuropathic pain and acupuncture 
Acupuncture therapies have become increasingly popular and 
are prescribed commonly by patients with chronic neurological 
disorders, including diabetic neuropathic pain (Abuaisha et al., 
1998; Hamza et al., 2000; Brunelli and Gorson, 2004). Human case 
series have demonstrated substantial symptom reduction without 
added side effects (Goodnick et al., 2000; Ahn et al., 2007). These 
data suggest that acupuncture is a safe and effective therapy for the 
long-term management of painful diabetic neuropathy, although 
its mechanism of action remains speculative. Some animal studies 
have reported the effect of EA stimulation using a diabetic animal 
model. Chang et al. suggested that electroacupuncture stimulation 
at the zhongwan acupoint induces plasma glucose concentration 
in an insulin-dependent manner (Chang et al., 1999), and the 
hypoglycemic action of 2-Hz EA at the ST36 acupoint was 
involved in the serotonin pathway (Chang et al., 2005). Lin et 
al. reported that chronic electrical stimulation could reduce the 
functional deficits of diabetic neuropathy (Lin et al., 2005). Our 
results indicated that EA stimulation increased p35 expression and 
reduced the cleavage of p35 to p25 in EA and MK-801 synergic 
treatment more than in an MK-801 monotherapy. 

DNP and NMDA and p35
NMDA receptors are involved in persistent pain and play an 
important role in central sensitization in diabetic neuropathic 
pain (Karadag et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2009). Although NMDA 
antagonists are highly effective in reducing neuropathic pain, 
these agents cause side effects at therapeutic doses including 
hallucination, dysphoria, and impairment of cognitive function 
(Sang et al., 2002; Cvrcek, 2008). Therefore, the development of 
methods with a reduced side effect profile is greatly needed. 
The stimulation of NMDA receptors reduces p35 levels via the 
proteasomal degradation by calpain in primary cortical neurons 
(Wei et al., 2005; Hosokawa et al., 2006). The N-methyl-d-
aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist glutamate was able to induce 
p35 cleavage, in a manner dependent on extracellular calcium, 
and p35 cleavage was prevented by the NMDA antagonist MK-
801 (Kerokoski et al., 2004). However, Hosokawa et al. suggested 
that the cleavage of p35 to p25 was not observed in 5 minute 
stimulation with NMDA or glutamate, and therefore, the NMDA-
induced downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 -p35 had 
a physiological function in postsynaptic activity (Hosokawa 
et al., 2006). Many authors have demonstrated that MK-801 
reverse diabetes-induced thermal hyperalgesia (Malcangio and 

Tomlinson, 1998; Begon et al., 2000; Gupta et al., 2003; Karadag 
et al., 2003; Daulhac et al., 2006). Additionally, a combination of 
NMDA receptor antagonists with opioids has been shown to be 
efficient in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain (Begon et 
al., 2002; Bujalska et al., 2008) and other forms of neuropathic 
pain (Nichols et al., 1997; Malyshkin et al., 2005). It has been well 
defined that acupuncture induces general analgesic effects in 
experimental studies, and the participation of various endogenous 
opioids and their receptors has been widely accepted (Han, 
2004; Okada and Kawakita, 2009). Zhang et al. reported that 
acupuncture at acupoint GB30 and NMDA receptor antagonist 
synergic treatment attenuates pain threshold in CFA-induced 
inflammatory hyperalgesia (Zhang et al., 2005). In this study, EA 
stimulation was applied at acupoint SP9 or ST36 in the diabetic 
neuropathic pain. But Xing et al. demonstrated that MK-801 
blocked the 2-Hz EA-induced spinal long-term depression 
of C-fiber-evoked potentials in spinal nerve ligation-induced 
neuropathic pain model (Xing et al., 2007). 
Our findings suggest that p35 will be a good target molecule 
for explaining the mechanism of complicated algesia in diabetic 
neuropathic pain. Additionally, we evaluated the expression level 
of p35 or p25 with L4, L5, and L6 segments of the lumbar spinal 
cord. P35 expression levels in the MK-801 and EA synergetic 
treatment groups were increased compared to the DNP group 
or 0.005 mg MK-801 treatment groups. The p25 expression level 
in the EA and sub-effective dose combined treatment group was 
significantly lower than both MK-801 single treatment groups 
(0.01 mg and 0.005 mg MK-801). But immunohistochemistry on 
spinal dorsal horn of L4, L5, and L6 segments needs further study 
for evaluating precise role of p35 or p25 in pain transmission. 
From these findings, the combination of EA with low doses of an 
NMDA receptor antagonist may provide improved strategies for 
pain management, thus potentially decreasing drug side effects in 
patients with persistent pain.
