Of the ceramide monohexosides (CMHs), gluco- and galactosyl-ceramides are the main
neutral glycosphingolipids expressed in fungal cells. Their structural determination is
greatly dependent on the use of mass spectrometric techniques, including fast atom
bombardment-mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization, and energy collision-induced
dissociation mass spectrometry. Nuclear magnetic resonance has also been used success-
fully. Such a combination of techniques, combined with classical analytical separation, such
as high-performance thin layer chromatography and column chromatography, has led to the
structural elucidation of a great number of fungal CMHs. The structure of fungal CMH is
conserved among fungal species and consists of a glucose or galactose residue attached
to a ceramide moiety containing 9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine with an amidic linkage to
hydroxylated fatty acids, most commonly having 16 or 18 carbon atoms and unsaturation
between C-3 and C-4. Along with their unique structural characteristics, fungal CMHs have
a peculiar subcellular distribution and striking biological properties. Fungal cerebrosides
were also characterized as antigenic molecules directly or indirectly involved in cell growth
or differentiation in Schizophyllum commune, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudallescheria
boydii, Candida albicans, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Colletotrichum
gloeosporioides. Besides classical techniques for cerebroside (CMH) analysis, we now
describe new approaches, combining conventional thin layer chromatography and mass
spectrometry, as well as emerging technologies for subcellular localization and distribution
of glycosphingolipids by secondary ion mass spectrometry and imaging matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-ﬂight.

INTRODUCTION
Cerebrosides are commonly called monohexosylceramides or
ceramide monohexosides (CMH). They are neutral glycosphin-
golipids that usually contain glucose or galactose, with β-glycosidic
linkages to the primary alcohol of an N -acyl sphingoid base
(ceramide). Cerebrosides can be found in plants, fungi, and ani-
mals, although clear differences in the structure of the ceramide
backbone of these organisms are observed. Galactosylceramide
is present only in fungi and animals. In contrast, glucosylce-
ramide is the unique glycosphingolipid which plants, fungi, and
animals have in common. CMHs have been widely detected in
fungal cells (reviewed by Warnecke and Heinz, 2003; Barreto-
Bergter et al., 2004). The current literature indicates that cere-
brosides seem to be present in almost all fungal species studied
so far, with Saccharomyces cerevisiae representing a well-known
exception together with Candida glabrata (Tavares et al., 2008).
Gluco- and galactosyl-ceramides are the main neutral glycosphin-
golipids expressed in fungal pathogens (Figure 1). The long-chain
base (LCB) 9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine is present in almost all
pathogenic fungi studied (Levery et al., 2000; Barreto-Bergter
et al., 2004). Structural modiﬁcations of the ceramide moiety
in these CMHs include different sites of unsaturation as well as
varying lengths of fatty acid residues. LCB was ﬁrst described
in monohexosylceramides from Aspergillus oryzae (Fujino and
Ohnishi, 1976) and was subsequently isolated from Schizophyllum

commune (Kawai and Ikeda, 1985), from the plant pathogen
Fusicoccum amygdale (Ballio et al., 1979), and the edible fungi
Clitocybe geotropa and Clitocybe nebularis (Fogedal et al., 1986).
CMHs were further characterized in lipid extracts from the fungal
species Alternaria raphani (Wang et al., 2009), Aspergillus fumi-
gatus (Boas et al., 1994; Toledo et al., 1999), Aspergillus nidulans
(Levery et al., 2002), Aspergillus niger (Levery et al., 2000; Lev-

2001), Zygosaccharomyces cidri, and Zygosaccharomyces fermentati
(Takakuwa et al., 2002).

Whereas many studies have focused on the functional roles of
glycosphingolipids in mammals, relatively little is known about
the structures of glycosphingolipids of pathogenic organisms, and
how such pathogen-derived glycosphingolipids inﬂuence immune
functions of their hosts.

CMHs have been characterized in fungal cells as bioactive mol-
ecules with several distinct roles. Fungal cerebrosides induce cell
differentiation in S. commune, and the 8E-double bond and the
methyl group at C-9 in the sphingoid base is essential for this
differentiation (Kawai and Ikeda, 1982). Monohexosylceramides
isolated from the rice pathogen M. grisea are active elicitors of the
hypersensitive response in rice (Koga et al., 1998; Umemura et al.,
2000).

The presence of CMH as a structural component of the fun-
gal cell wall was clearly demonstrated by electron microscopy of
yeast cells of C. neoformans labeled with immunogold antibodies
(Rodrigues et al., 2000) and by immunoﬂuorescence of mycelium
cells of C. gloeosporioides, using a monoclonal antibody to GlcCer
(da Silva et al., 2004). Glucosylceramides from P. boydii, accumu-
lated on the surface of mycelia and pseudo-hyphal forms, were
recognized by antibodies from rabbits immunized with P. boydii
whole cells (Pinto et al., 2002).

A monoclonal antibody to the glucosylceramide synthesized
by P. brasiliensis was produced and reacted with A. fumigatus
conidiophore. This ﬁnding supported the idea that CMHs are pref-
erentially accumulated on surface sites related to fungal growth,
but it also suggested that they are involved in the differentiation
process (Toledo et al., 2001).

Using polyclonal antibodies or Mabs anti-monohexosylcera
mides, our group showed that CMHs were associated with fun-
gal growth (Rodrigues et al., 2000; Nimrichter et al., 2005) and
morphological transitions in C. neoformans, P. boydii, C. albicans,
A. fumigatus, C. gloeosporioides, and S. apiospermum (reviewed by
Barreto-Bergter et al., 2004).

We now describe methods to extract neutral glycosphin-
golipids (GSLs) from fungal cells, techniques to separate them by
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or high-performance thin layer

chromatography (HPTLC) and, ﬁnally, strategies to structurally
characterize the glycan and ceramide moieties of the GSLs.

ISOLATION AND PURIFICATION
The methodology described herein follows the steps of puriﬁ-
cation routinely used in our laboratory for CMH extraction and
puriﬁcation (Boas et al., 1994; Duarte et al., 1998, Pinto et al., 2002;
da Silva et al., 2004), although different methods are available
in the current literature for isolation and puriﬁcation of CMHs
(reviewed by Barreto-Bergter et al., 2004).

Fungal cells are successively extracted with chloroform–
methanol (2:1 and 1:2 v/v). Extracts are combined, dried, and the
crude lipid extract is partitioned according to (Folch et al., 1957).
The lipids recovered from the Folch lower layer are fractionated
on a silica gel column eluted with chloroform, acetone, and then
methanol. The acetone and methanol fractions containing CMHs
are further puriﬁed on a silica gel column, which are sequentially
eluted with chloroform–methanol with increasing concentrations
of methanol (95:5, 9:1, 8:2, and 1:1 v/v), and ﬁnally with 100%
methanol. Fractions eluted with chloroform–methanol (9:1 and
8:2 v/v) are further puriﬁed by chromatography on Iatrobeads RS
2060 (Macherey and Nagel, Düren, Germany), using the same elu-
tion system, to provide a puriﬁed glycosphingolipid fraction. A
typical example of the puriﬁcation of cerebrosides is shown in
Figure 2.

ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES TO STUDY CEREBROSIDES
HIGH-PERFORMANCE THIN-LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY
Thin-layer chromatography is a popular and convenient tech-
nique for separation and identiﬁcation of CMH, and is the
ﬁrst step in analysis of glycosphingolipids, requiring only small
amounts (3–4 nM) of material (Scandroglio et al., 2009). This
technique does not allow determination of chemical structures,
but can give preliminary information on their structures based on
chromatographic mobility, in comparison with standards (Wells
and Dittmer, 1965; Scandroglio et al., 2009) and the reaction
with speciﬁc staining reagents (Svennerholm, 1956; Scandroglio
et al., 2009). Cerebrosides are analyzed on HPTLC plates devel-
oped with CHCl3–MeOH–H2O (65:25:4 v/v) or CHCl3–MeOH–
2M NH4OH (40:10:1 v/v/v; Pinto et al., 2002; Rollin-Pinheiro et
al., unpublished) and visualized through iodine vapor, which is
absorbed by both saturated and unsaturated lipids (Kates, 1986),
and by spraying the plates with orcinol–sulfuric acid, in which case
cerebrosides give violet spots (Svennerholm, 1956).

MASS SPECTROMETRY APPLIED TO FUNGAL LIPID ANALYSIS
Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for the analysis of
lipids. However, in the early days of its development, the intact
lipids could not be directly analyzed by MS, since the available
ionization sources produced ions by accelerating electrons elec-
tron ionization (EI), which should provide the molecules in a
gaseous phase, to transfer their energy on ionization. This was the
limiting factor for its application, since the molecules must have
a sufﬁcient vapor pressure to enter into the gaseous phase of the
mass spectrometer’s ion source. Brieﬂy, MS with EI was coupled to
gas chromatography (GC–MS) and lipids could be analyzed. How-
ever, in order to become analyzable, CMHs should be converted
to their constituent moieties (sugar, fatty acids, LCB), submit-
ted to appropriate chemical derivatization and then identiﬁed by
GC–MS.

To overcome the requirements for volatilization, the glycosph-
ingolipids were methanolyzed and their components analyzed as
fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) (Duarte et al., 1998).

The monosaccharide components of glycosphingolipids were
analyzed by GC–MS, by conversion to alditol acetate deriva-
tives after being liberated by acid hydrolysis (Sawardeker et al.,
1965). Long-chain bases were released (LCB, or sphingoid
base) from CMH by methanolysis and analyzed by GC–MS
as the TMS derivatives after treatment with bis-(trimethylsilyl)
-triﬂuoroacetamide/pyridine (Zanetta et al., 1999; Sweeley, 1963;
Karlsson and Holm, 1965). A simple derivatization method
established by Sassaki et al. (2008) can also be employed for

GC–MS identiﬁcation of monosaccharides and LCB, present in
glycosphingolipids.

The highly energetic electrons (70 eV) in EI produce radical
ions, but a secondary effect associated with EI is an intense pro-
duction of fragment-ions, due to the extensive covalent-linkage
breakdown promoted by the absorbed energy by the molecules.

In order to overcome the tendency of fragmentation during the
ionization process, other ion sources have been developed, called
soft ionization methods.

SOFT IONIZATION TECHNIQUES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE
STRUCTURE OF INTACT LIPIDS
The soft ionization technologies allow ionization and transfer-
ring non-volatile and thermolabile molecules to the gaseous
phase without extensive production of fragments, impossible
with EI. This type of source became available from 1980s with
the introduction of fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry
(FAB-MS), followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrom-
etry (ESI-MS), and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
(MALDI). Another important characteristic is that these tech-
niques allow changing the ion polarity, since it is possible to
produce ions via cation or anion interactions, such as proto-
nation, sodiation, lithiation or deprotonation, chlorination, and
so on. Nowadays, variations of these techniques are also found,
such as nano-ESI-MS, photospray ionization, as well as those
called ambient MS, which include direct analysis in real time-mass
spectrometry (DART-MS) and desorption electrospray (DESI),

suitable for analysis of analytes deposited on a surface, such as
with HPTLC.

The ions obtained from intact molecules provide information
on their molecular weight, as well as fragmentation being an
important tool for structural analysis. The MS instrumentation
allow separation of a speciﬁc ion and subjecting it to a fragmenta-
tion process, as occurring in collision-induced dissociation (CID)
or collision-activated dissociation (CAD). This type of analysis is
usually referred to as tandem-MS and the spectrometers operat-
ing in tandem mode consist of conjugated analyzers, such as triple
quadrupole (TQ or QQQ), quadrupole-time of ﬂight (Q-TOF) or
the ion trap, and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-
ICR) analyzers, which allow the re-fragmentation of product ions
(fragment-ions from MS/MS) usually referred to as MSn.

FAST ATOM BOMBARDMENT-MASS SPECTROMETRY
Fast atom bombardment was ﬁrst introduced by (Barber et al.,
1981a,b; Morris et al., 1981). The sample is dissolved in a non-
volatile liquid matrix (e.g., glycerol, thioglycerol, triethanolamine),
and the mixture is bombarded by a beam of accelerated atoms
(typically argon or xenon). Non-volatile, polar, and thermola-
bile molecules, such as lipids, could be ionized directly analyzed
(Murphy et al., 1982). FAB-MS is considered to be a relatively soft
ionization technique, since it produces primary the molecular ion
(quasi- or pseudo-molecular ions), although numerous fragments
ions are typically generated.

Since FAB-MS allowed the analysis of a broad range of intact
molecules, it rapidly became one of the most commonly used
techniques for structural characterization of lipids, including a
wide variety of fungal cerebrosides, using native and peracety-
lated samples (reviewed by Levery, 2005). The structure of A.

fumigatus CMH was elucidated, using FAB-MS in the positive
mode (Boas et al., 1994). Spectra were obtained using per-
acetylated samples, in the presence and the absence of sodium
acetate, and the main CMH from A.
fumigatus was iden-
-N -hydroxyoctadecenoyl-1-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-9-
tiﬁed as 2
methyl-4,8-sphingadienine. The presence of an additional
ceramide containing 2-hydroxy-octadecanoic acid was reported
by (Toledo et al., 1999), employing ESI-MS and ESI-MS/CID.

(cid:2)

Using peracetylated samples with positive- and negative-ion
FAB-MS, other cerebrosides were characterized by our group from
A. versicolor, C. neoformans, F.pedrosoi, F. solani, Fusarium sp.,
and M. grisea (reviewed by Barreto-Bergter et al., 2004). FAB-
MS analysis of native and peracetylated samples indicated that the
glycolipid from P. boydii consisted of two components that dif-
fer in their fatty acid compositions. In a negative-ion spectrum,
deprotonated molecules appeared at m/z 726 and 754, consistent
with monohexosylceramides containing hydroxyl-hexadecanoic
and hydroxyl-octadecanoic acids, and C19 sphingadienine. On
peracetylation with acetic anhydride/pyridine, [M+ Na]
ions
were at m/z 1030 and 1002, indicating addition of six acetyl
groups to the mass of the underivatized glycolipids, consistent
with hydroxyl acid-containing monohexosylceramides (Figure 3).
Over the past decades, FAB-MS/MS has been used to charac-
terize sphingolipids, since it offers many advantages for structural
elucidation and has high-energy CID capabilities (Domon and
Costello, 1988; Pittenauer and Allmaier, 2009a,b; Ann and Adams,
1992; Ann and Adams, 1993). Evidence for the location of double
bonds in the long-chain base was obtained by collisional activation
of the sphingadienine fragments at m/z 276. Cleavages of the
alkyl chain indicated the presence of a 4,8-sphingadienine struc-
ture, with a methyl substituent on C-9. An identical fragment ion

spectrum was obtained from collision activation of m/z 276 in the
FAB spectrum of the CMH from F. solani (Duarte et al., 1998) and
A. fumigatus (Boas et al., 1994).

ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETRY
In the mid 1980s, two soft ionization techniques were developed,
ESI by John Fenn (Yamashita and Fenn, 1984) and MALDI (Karas
et al., 1987). These techniques allowed direct analysis by MS of a
great number of lipids.

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is an atmospheric
pressure ionization technique, in which the sample can be dis-
solved in common solvents, such as methanol, acetonitrile, water,
or in mixtures. The sample passes through a capillary tube, to
which an intense electrical ﬁeld is applied creating a spray of
charged particles which are dried with the aid of a nitrogen
ﬂow and the ionized analytes are transferred to mass analyzers
(Yamashita and Fenn, 1984).

Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization is a desorption ion-
ization (DI) method which deserves special attention because,
besides its extraordinary sensitivity, it is efﬁcient in produc-
ing intact molecular ions of large biological compounds. The
MALDI matrix compounds are usually organic acids that have
strong electronic absorption in the region of the applied laser
wavelength.

Ions obtained by the soft ionization processes usually appear as
protonated or deprotonated species, depending on their chemical
characteristics. However, it is also common to ﬁnd ions pro-
duced by the combination of the analyte with different cations
or anions, such as Na
, which are referred to
as adducts. These ions are commonly present in the solvent and
could aid the ionization of several polar molecules, such as neu-
tral glycolipids. On the other hand, small amounts of speciﬁc
adducts (e.g., Li
) can be added to the solvent, to increase ion
production.

Ions obtained from intact molecules contain information on
their molecular weight, although further information is neces-
sary to deﬁne their chemical structures. Accordingly, the majority
of mass spectrometers allow the selection of a speciﬁc ion and
its fragmentation. This type of analysis is usually referred to
as tandem-MS (MS/MS). Spectrometers capable of performing
tandem-MS consist of conjugated analyzers, such as TQ or QQQ,
Q-TOF or the ion trap analyzer.

Positive-ion mode ESI-MS employing quadrupole instruments
has been used extensively for fungal cerebroside analysis (Toledo
et al., 1999; Levery et al., 2000; Toledo et al., 2000; da Silva et al.,
2004; Nimrichter et al., 2005). A GlcCer-enriched fraction of C.
gloeosporioides was analyzed in the positive ion ESI-MS mode
[M+ H]
. Two major ion species appeared at m/z 754 and 756,
as well as their corresponding fragments at m/z 736 and 738, gen-
erated by the loss of elements of water (Figure 4A). ESI-MS/MS
has also been applied and major fragment-ions at m/z 594 and
592 were obtained, and assigned to 2
-N -hydroxyoctadecanoyl-
(cid:2)
9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine and 2
-N -hydroxyoctadecenoyl-9-
methyl-4,8-sphingadienine respectively (Figures 4B,C) (da Silva
et al., 2004).

As neutral molecules, CMHs can be analyzed by MS with the aid
of adducts, the most common one being Na
. However, the use of
other adducts could reveal more details from the structures, by evi-
dencing fragments which could be missed. The use of Li
, as LiCl,
or LiI, to aid cationization of neutral molecules containing carbo-
hydrates has proven to be useful, improving ion detection and
fragmentation provided by collision-induced dissociation-mass
spectrometry (CID-MS), using less energies than other common
alkali cations (i.e., Na
). ESI-MS/CID-MS of lithium
adducts was applied for analysis of cerebrosides from F. pedrosoi
(Nimrichter et al., 2005), A. niger, C. albicans, Cryptococcus spp.,
and yeast and mycelium forms of P. brasiliensis (Levery et al., 2000).

adducts has been used by our group for cerebroside analysis of S.
apiospermum, an opportunistic human pathogen that belongs to
the P. boydii/Scedosporium complex (Rollin-Pinheiro et al., unpub-
lished). Ions with ranging from m/z 700 to 800 were detected,
with two major ion species appearing at m/z 734 [M+ Li]
and
750 [M+ Li]
(Figure 5A). Although in a different ratio, similar
results were found in the analysis of glycosphingolipids from Cla-
dosporium resinae (Figure 5B), a saprophytic species commonly
found as a contaminant in fuel oil storage tanks (Lindley and Hey-
derman, 1985; Seifert et al., 2007). CID-MS analysis conﬁrmed
their similarities and revealed that the differences were located in
the LCB moieties (Figures 6A–D).

and the saprophytic Cladosporium resinae (B).

An ESI-MS examination of lipid extracts from F. pedrosoi (Nim-
richter et al., 2005), another human pathogen, also showed the
presence of an ion at m/z 750. This was interpreted as result-
ing from a ceramide with a LCB containing one more hydroxyl
group. This hypothesis was supported by the analysis of the per-
methylated CMH derivative, showing a molecular, monolithiated
ion at m/z 862, consistent with addition of eight methyl groups.
Fragmentation of permethylated CMH suggested that the addi-
tional hydroxyl group is linked to C-4 or C-5 of its long-chain
base (Nimrichter et al., 2005). However, this LCB conserves other
characteristics of fungal LCBs, such as the presence of a double

phytosphingosine.

NMR SPECTROSCOPY
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a non-
destructive method capable of furnishing information concerning
the primary structure of cerebrosides, such as monosaccharide
composition, anomeric conﬁguration, and size of the sugar rings.
The assignments of all ceramide signals could also be obtained
without interference of the sugar moiety.

Fungal cerebrosides have been characterized by 1D, 2-D-1H-
NMR, and 13C-NMR spectroscopy as native (underivatized) or
peracetylated samples.

Native glycosphingolipid fractions isolated from Paracoccid-
ioides brasiliensis (Toledo et al., 1999), Aspergillus fumigatus
(Toledo et al., 1999), Sporothrix schenckii (Toledo et al., 2000),
Histoplasma capsulatum (Toledo et al., 2001), dissolved in DMSO–
d6/2% D2O have been extensively analyzed by a series of 1-
and 2-D homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR experiments
(1H-1H TOCSY, NOESY, 1H-13C HSQC, HMBC). According to
the authors, this solvent presents superior solubility character-
istics as compared with CDCl3/CD3OD mixtures and chemi-
cal shift reproducibility for cerebrosides without the need for
derivatization. Using these techniques, a native glycosphingolipid

fraction from Fusarium oxysporum dissolved in CDCl3–CD3OD
was recently characterized (Figure 7).

1H and 13C-NMR spectra for several fungal glucosylceramides
have been previously recorded as per-O-acetylated compounds in
CDCl3 (Fogedal et al., 1986; Boas et al., 1994; da Silva et al., 1997;
Duarte et al., 1998) and more recently in M. alpina (Batrakov et al.,
2002) and F. graminearum (Zaüner et al., 2008).

In the 1H-NMR spectrum of the peracetylated GlcCer of A.
fumigatus, protons corresponding to a β-glucopyranosyl unit were
recognized by their characteristic chemical shifts (Boas et al.,
1994). The spectrum displayed one sharp doublet at δ 4.47 ppm
with a coupling constant J 1,2 = 7.9 Hz due to anomeric nuclei. The

remaining protons appearing in the spectrum were in agreement
with the β-glucopyranose structure. The structure of the long-
chain base was deduced from one- and two-dimensional NMR
spectra. The proton to proton COSY spectrum enabled the con-
nectivity of the long-chain base protons to be traced between H-1
and H-11 and those of the fatty acid from H-2 to H-5. The chem-
ical shifts of 5.30 and 5.50 ppm, assigned to the long-chain base
H-3 and the fatty acid H-2, respectively, were typical of protons
with acetylated OH-groups neighboring the oleﬁnic bonds. For
H-4 and H-5 of the long-chain base, we found a coupling con-
stant of 15.3 Hz and for the protons H-3 and H-4 of the fatty acid
14.3 Hz, respectively, typical of trans-double bonds. An additional

upﬁeld resonance for the cerebrosides was that of the sphingadie-
nine 9-methyl group which was a singlet at ∼1.545 ppm. However,
the chain lengths of the fatty acid and the sphingosine moieties of
GlcCer could not be determined by NMR analysis, in contrast with
mass spectrometric methods (Levery, 2005).

In summary, a series of CMHs were isolated from patho-
genic fungi and their structures elucidated using a combination
of HPTLC, FAB-MS, ESI-MS spectrometry, and NMR. Their
principal structures are shown in Figure 8.

TLC OVERLAY TECHNIQUES
The TLC overlay technique was introduced by Magnani et al.
(1980) and consists of resolution of the glycosphingolipid on a
TLC plate, with detection of the CMH in situ using speciﬁc lig-
ands as antibodies, bacterial toxins, carbohydrate-speciﬁc viruses,
and bacteria. Crude lipid extracts containing glycosphingolipids
as minor components could also be analyzed, avoiding time con-
suming puriﬁcation procedures. It is a highly sensitive technique
that only requires nanogram quantities of CMH (Meisen et al.,
2011).

HIGH-PERFORMANCE THIN-LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY
IMMUNOSTAINING
Using anti-glucosylceramide antibodies, CMH could be identiﬁed
in cell wall lipid extracts of C. neoformans separated by HPTLC
(Rodrigues et al., 2000). Using an IgG 2a monoclonal antibody
anti-glucosylceramide (MEST-2), Toledo et al. (2001) showed that
this Mab reacts with glucosylceramide from yeast and mycelium
forms of P. brasiliensis, H. capsulatum, S. schenckii, hyphae of

A. fumigatus, and yeast forms of C. albicans, C. neoformans, C.
laurentii, and C. albidus. The same results were observed using
solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA). Studies on the speciﬁcity
of MEST-2 showed that the epitope required for binding of this
Mab with glucosylceramide would involve the β-D-Glc residue and
the 2-hydroxyl group of the fatty acid from the ceramide portion
of the GlcCer (Toledo et al., 2001).

NEW APPLICATIONS IN THE MASS SPECTROMETRIC
ANALYSIS OF CEREBROSIDES
THIN-LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY–IONIZATION ORTHOGONAL
TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY–MASS SPECTROMETRY
With the recent development of ambient MS, the lipids from dif-
ferent sources have been analyzed by HPTLC, and then subjected
to MS using desorption techniques, such as DESI and MALDI.
The coupling of complementary techniques as TLC and MS could
open new avenues for knowledge of speciﬁc structural information
using trace amounts of fungal glycosphingolipids.

Using the TLC overlay assay, combined with infrared matrix-
assisted laser desorption/ionization orthogonal
time-of-ﬂight
mass spectrometry (IR-MALDI–O-TOF-MS), Müsken et al.
(2010) carried out the structural characterization of globo-
series neutral GSLs (microbial GSL-receptor), recognized by P-
ﬁmbriated Escherichia coli, the agent of upper urinary tract infec-
tions in humans. The method could be applicable for any GSL-
binding non-pathogenic and/or pathogenic E. coli strain, or other
microbes such as Helicobacter pylori or viruses. A detailed sur-
vey of methodological aspects of this technique is available in the
comprehensive review by Meisen et al. (2011).

Fungal cerebrosides

This new methodology was successfully applied to the identiﬁ-
cation of cancer-associated GSLs in several types of human tumors
(Müthing and Distler, 2010).

IMAGING MASS SPECTROMETRY
Current techniques used to identify and quantify glycosph-
ingolipids require a prior extraction and their removal from
biological material (cells, tissues) resulting in a loss of information.
Direct tissue analysis and imaging MS are emerging technolo-
gies that can help in answering questions raised by current ana-
lytical techniques. The subcellular localization and distribution of
glycosphingolipids are now beginning to be probed directly using
secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and MALDI techniques
(reviewed by Haynes et al., 2009).

In MALDI–MS, the surface of a sample is coated with a matrix
which serves to absorb the laser beam, and then volatilize and
ionize the sample. For SIMS, the sample is directly desorbed by
a primary ion bombardment. A simultaneous acquisition of a
large number of biological compounds in mixtures, with the excel-
lent sensitivity obtained by ToF mass analyzer, are the advantages
of these techniques, when compared with others using chemical
imaging (reviewed by Touboul et al., 2011).

CONCLUSION
techniques used
This review summarizes classical analytical
for the identiﬁcation and structural determination of
fun-
gal cerebrosides. MS has emerged as a powerful technique
for the analysis of cerebrosides, including analytical variations
as FAB/MS, ESI-MS, and low energy ESI-MS/CID-MS. 1H
and 13C-NMR have also been successfully used in cerebro-
side structural analysis. The combination of these techniques
is usually sufﬁcient for a complete structural elucidation. A
detailed structural information of fungal cerebrosides is required
in order to elucidate the biological role of these molecules.
Also discussed here are some emerging techniques as TLC–IR-
MALDI–MS and imaging MS in the analysis of glycosphin-
golipids.
