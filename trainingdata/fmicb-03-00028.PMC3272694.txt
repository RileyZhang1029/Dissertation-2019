Iron is an essential but, in excess, toxic nutrient.Therefore, fungi evolved ﬁne-tuned mecha-
nisms for uptake and storage of iron, such as the production of siderophores (low-molecular
mass iron-speciﬁc chelators). In Aspergillus fumigatus, iron starvation causes extensive
transcriptional remodeling involving two central transcription factors, which are intercon-
nected in a negative transcriptional feed-back loop: the GATA-factor SreA and the bZip-factor
HapX. During iron sufﬁciency, SreA represses iron uptake, including reductive iron assimi-
lation and siderophore-mediated iron uptake, to avoid toxic effects. During iron starvation,
HapX represses iron-consuming pathways, including heme biosynthesis and respiration, to
spare iron and activates synthesis of ribotoxin AspF1 and siderophores, the latter partly by
ensuring supply of the precursor, ornithine. In accordance with the expression pattern and
mode of action, detrimental effects of inactivation of SreA and HapX are conﬁned to growth
during iron sufﬁciency and iron starvation, respectively. Deﬁciency in HapX, but not SreA,
attenuates virulence of A. fumigatus in a murine model of aspergillosis, which underlines
the crucial role of adaptation to iron limitation in virulence. Consistently, production of both
extra and intracellular siderophores is crucial for virulence of A. fumigatus. Recently, the
sterol regulatory element binding protein SrbA was found to be essential for adaptation
to iron starvation, thereby linking regulation of iron metabolism, ergosterol biosynthesis,
azole drug resistance, and hypoxia adaptation.

INTRODUCTION
Iron is an essential nutrient for all eukaryotes and nearly all
prokaryotes (Kaplan and Kaplan, 2009). As mono or diiron cen-
ter as well as incorporated into heme or iron–sulfur clusters,
this metal is an indispensable cofactor for a variety of cellular
processes including electron transport, amino acid metabolism,
and biosynthesis of DNA and sterols. Nevertheless, iron excess
has the potential to catalyze the formation of cell-damaging
reactive oxygen species (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1984). The
complex intertwining of iron metabolism and oxidative stress is
emphasized by the iron-dependence of detoxiﬁcation of oxida-
tive stress as, e.g., catalases and peroxidases require heme as
cofactor. Despite its high abundance in the Earth’s crust, the
bioavailability of iron is low owing to its oxidation into spar-
ingly soluble ferric (Fe3+
) hydroxides by atmospheric oxygen.
To ensure iron supply but to avoid iron toxicity, all organ-
isms evolved sophisticated mechanisms to balance acquisition,
storage, and consumption of
iron. The control over access
to iron is one of the central battleﬁelds during infection as
pathogens have to “steal” the iron from the host. Moreover, the
mammalian innate immune system restricts access to iron by
pathogens via a variety of mechanisms (Ganz, 2009; Weinberg,
2009).

Aspergillus fumigatus

is a ubiquitous saprophytic fungus,
which has become the most common air-borne fungal pathogen
of humans (Tekaia and Latge, 2005). Clinical manifestations
range from allergic reactions to life-threatening invasive dis-
ease, termed aspergillosis, particularly in immuno-compromised
patients. The identiﬁcation and functional characterization of 24
genes that are involved in iron homeostasis in A. fumigatus and/or
Aspergillus nidulans, respectively, revealed signiﬁcant insights into
iron metabolism and its regulation (Table 1). A. nidulans is a
less virulent A. fumigatus relative and longstanding genetic model
organism. Inactivation of 10 of the 19 A. fumigatus genes caused
defects in virulence. All of the virulence-associated genes are
transcriptionally upregulated during iron starvation and encode
functions that are important for survival during iron starvation,
which emphasizes the crucial role of adaptation to iron starva-
tion in virulence. This review summarizes the current knowl-
edge on iron homeostasis and its role in virulence in Aspergillus
spp.

IRON ACQUISITION
As microorganisms are believed to lack mechanisms for iron
excretion, control of iron uptake is considered the major iron
homeostatic mechanism (Haas et al., 2008). In contrast to var-
ious bacterial and fungal pathogens (Ratledge and Dover, 2000;
Almeida et al., 2009), both A. fumigatus and A. nidulans lack
systems for direct uptake of host iron sources such as heme, fer-
ritin, or transferrin (Eisendle et al., 2003; Schrettl et al., 2004a).

Both Aspergillus species employ low-afﬁnity ferrous (Fe2+
) iron
acquisition as well as siderophore-assisted iron uptake, a high-
afﬁnity ferric iron uptake system (Eisendle et al., 2003; Schrettl
et al., 2004a). In contrast to A. nidulans, A. fumigatus pos-
sesses a second high-afﬁnity iron uptake system, termed reductive
iron assimilation (RIA). Schemes of the mechanisms for iron
uptake and storage employed by Aspergillus spp. are found in

recently published reviews (Haas et al., 2008; Schrettl and Haas,
2011).

LOW-AFFINITY IRON UPTAKE
At the molecular level, low-afﬁnity iron uptake has been character-
ized exclusively in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The relevant perme-
ases are not speciﬁc for ferrous iron but additionally transport

other metals, such as copper and zinc (Kaplan and Kaplan,
2009).

REDUCTIVE IRON ASSIMILATION
Reductive iron assimilation starts with reduction of ferric iron
sources to the more soluble ferrous iron by plasma membrane-
localized metalloreductases (Kosman, 2010). A. fumigatus encodes
15 putative metalloreductases indicating possible redundancy of
this enzyme system. The metalloreductase FreB has recently been
shown to be involved in RIA (Blatzer et al., 2011b). The reduced
ferrous iron is re-oxidized and imported by a protein complex con-
sisting of the ferroxidase FetC and the iron permease FtrA (Schrettl
et al., 2004a).

SIDEROPHORE-MEDIATED IRON UPTAKE
The siderophores produced by A. nidulans and A. fumigatus are
shown in Figure 1. Both fungal species excrete two siderophores,
fusarinine C (FsC) and its derivative triacetylfusarinine C (TAFC),
to mobilize extracellular iron. The ferri-forms of FsC and TAFC
are taken up by siderophore-iron transporters (SIT), which con-
stitute a subfamily of the major facilitator protein superfamily.
SIT act most likely as proton symporters energized by the plasma
membrane potential (Haas et al., 2003; Philpott and Protchenko,
2008). SIT-mediated iron uptake appears to be universally con-
served in the fungal kingdom, even in species not producing
siderophores such as S. cerevisiae, Candida spp., and Cryptococ-
cus neoformans (Schrettl et al., 2004b; Haas et al., 2008; Jung
and Kronstad, 2008; Philpott and Protchenko, 2008; Nevitt and
Thiele, 2011). A likely reason is the dramatically increased solubil-
ity and therefore bioavailability of iron chelated by siderophores.
Moreover, siderophores might play a role in microbial warfare as
chelation of environmental iron by siderophore-types that are not
recognized by competitors might be used to starve competitors of
iron. This is counteracted by evolving transporters that recognize
xenosiderophores, i.e., siderophores that are not produced by the
organism, which enables “stealing” of siderophores. This scenario
is supported by the fact that most siderophore-producing bacte-
ria and fungi possess xenosiderophore-speciﬁc SITs (Haas et al.,
2008). A. fumigatus and A. nidulans encode 10 and 7 putative

SITs, respectively (Haas et al., 2008). Heterologous expression in
a S. cerevisiae mutant lacking high-afﬁnity iron uptake indicated
that the A. nidulans SITs MirA and MirB transport the bacter-
ial siderophore enterobactin and TAFC, respectively (Haas et al.,
2003).

After uptake, the intracellular release of iron from TAFC and
FsC involves hydrolysis of the siderophore backbones by the
esterase EstB (Kragl et al., 2007).

IRON STORAGE
Extracellular siderophores are employed by most bacterial and
some plant species. In contrast, intracellular siderophores are only
found in siderophore-producing fungi. A. fumigatus produces two
different intracellular siderophores (Figure 1), ferricrocin (FC) for
hyphal iron storage and distribution and its derivative hydroxy-
ferricrocin (HFC) for conidial iron storage (Schrettl et al., 2007;
Wallner et al., 2009). A. nidulans lacks HFC and employs FC
for both hyphal and conidial iron storage (Eisendle et al., 2003).
Additionally, the iron-inducible expression of CccA, the ortholog
of the vacuolar iron importer Ccc1p from S. cerevisiae (Kaplan
and Kaplan, 2009), indicates vacuolar iron storage in A. fumigatus
(Schrettl et al., 2008). In contrast to bacteria, plants, and animals,
fungi lack ferritin-mediated iron storage and detoxiﬁcation.

SIDEROPHORE BIOSYNTHESIS
three N 5-anhydromevalonyl-N 5-
Fusarinine C consists of
hydroxyornithine residues cyclically linked by ester bonds. TAFC
is the N 2-acetylated FsC. FC is a cyclic hexapeptide with the struc-
ture Gly-Ser-Gly-(N 5-acetyl-N 5-hydroxyornithine)3 and HFC is
the hydroxylated FC (Haas et al., 2008). The siderophore biosyn-
thesis (SB) pathway was characterized by reverse genetics and is
shown in Figure 2. The ﬁrst committed step in the biosynthesis
of all four siderophores is the hydroxylation of ornithine cat-
alyzed by the ornithine monooxygenase SidA (Eisendle et al., 2003;
Schrettl et al., 2004a). Subsequently, the pathways for biosynthesis
of extra and intracellular siderophores split. For extracellular SB
the transacylase SidF transfers anhydromevalonyl to hydroxyor-
nithine (Schrettl et al., 2007). The required anhydromevalonyl-
CoA moiety is derived from mevalonate by CoA-ligation and

dehydration catalyzed by SidI and SidH, respectively (Yasmin et al.,
2011). The acetylation of hydroxyornithine for intracellular SB
involves two transacetylases, the constitutively expressed SidL and
an unidentiﬁed enzyme, the activity of which is upregulated by
iron starvation (Blatzer et al., 2011c). Assembly of FsC and FC
is catalyzed by two different non-ribosomal peptide synthetases
(NRPS), SidD and SidC, respectively. TAFC and HFC are formed
by SidG-mediated N 2-acetylation of FsC and hydroxylation of
FC, respectively (Eisendle et al., 2003; Schrettl et al., 2007). NRPS,
polyketide synthases, and the lysine-biosynthetic α-aminoadipate
reductase depend on activation by the 4
-phosphopantetheinyl
transferase. Consistently, the 4
-phosphopantetheinyl transferases
NpgA and PptA are essential for SB in A. nidulans and A. fumigatus,
respectively (Oberegger et al., 2003; Allen et al., 2011). Conse-
quently, it is not surprising that this enzyme was found to be
indispensable for phytopathogenic fungi (Horbach et al., 2009).

GENOMIC ORGANIZATION OF GENES INVOLVED IN
HIGH-AFFINITY IRON ACQUISITION
Most of the described SB genes above are organized in three
gene clusters containing additional genes encoding putative
siderophore transporters, the TAFC esterase EstB and genes with
uncharacterized functions (Schrettl et al., 2008, 2010a). Excep-
tions are the genes encoding SidA, SidL, and NpgA/PptA. Notably,
SidL and NpgA/PptA are special for another reason as their
expression is, in contrast to the other identiﬁed structural com-
ponents of siderophore metabolism, not regulated by iron avail-
ability (Oberegger et al., 2003; Blatzer et al., 2011c). Moreover,

NpgA/PptA is not exclusively involved in SB. In contrast to A.
fumigatus and A. nidulans, SidA ortholog-encoding genes are clus-
tered with siderophore NRPS in various other fungi, e.g., Ustilago
maydis and Neurospora crassa (Haas et al., 2008). The genes encod-
ing FtrA and FetC form a gene cluster with a common promoter
region.

DEFECTS CAUSED BY SIDEROPHORE-DEFICIENCY
Genetic elimination of extracellular siderophores (ΔsidF and
ΔsidD mutants) decreases growth, conidiation, and oxidative
stress resistance during iron limitation but not during iron
sufﬁciency, which enables compensation by other iron acquisi-
tion systems (Schrettl et al., 2007). Elimination of intracellular
siderophores (ΔsidC mutant) reduces conidiation and blocks sex-
ual development (as shown in A. nidulans) due to the role of FC
in intracellular iron transport from substrate-contacting hyphae
into aerial hyphae (Eisendle et al., 2006; Schrettl et al., 2007;
Wallner et al., 2009). FC-deﬁciency decreases the conidial iron
content by about 50%, which impairs iron-dependent enzymes
such as aconitase and catalase A, and thereby decreases conidial
size and conidial resistance to oxidative stress (Schrettl et al., 2007;
Wallner et al., 2009). Moreover, the lack of FC-mediated iron
storage (ΔsidC mutants) delays germination during iron starva-
tion (Schrettl et al., 2007). Inactivation of the entire siderophore
system (ΔsidA mutant) combines the defects caused by inacti-
vation of either extra or intracellular SB and renders A. fumiga-
tus extremely sensitive to iron starvation (Schrettl et al., 2004a,
2007).

The iron link of Aspergillus fumigatus virulence

Both extra and intracellular siderophores are crucial for viru-
lence as elimination of the entire SB (ΔsidA mutant) results in
absolute avirulence of A. fumigatus in a murine model of invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis (Schrettl et al., 2004a; Hissen et al., 2005),
while deﬁciency in either extracellular (ΔsidI, ΔsidH, ΔsidF, or
ΔsidD mutants) or intracellular siderophores (ΔsidC mutants)
causes partial attenuation of virulence (Schrettl et al., 2007; Yas-
min et al., 2011). Conidial FC appears to play a particularly crucial
role during initiation of infection because restoration of the coni-
dial HFC content by supplementation with FC during conidiation
partially cures the virulence defect of ΔsidA conidia (Schrettl et al.,
2007). SidG-deﬁciency, which eliminates TAFC production with
concomitant increase of FsC production, affects neither growth
nor virulence, indicating that the structural differences between
these two siderophores do not play a role in these settings (Schrettl
et al., 2007). Consistent with a role in iron acquisition during infec-
tion, A. fumigatus’ siderophores are able to remove iron from host
sources, such as transferrin (Hissen et al., 2004; Hissen and Moore,
2005).

Blocking RIA (ΔftrA mutant) does not affect virulence of A.
fumigatus (Schrettl et al., 2004a). Nevertheless, a putative role of
RIA in virulence is indicated by several lines of evidence: (i) elimi-
nation of extracellular siderophores causes only partial attenuation
of virulence, (ii) mutants lacking both RIA and the siderophore
system (ΔftrAΔsidA double mutant) are unable to grow unless
supplemented with siderophores or extremely high iron concen-
trations fueling low-afﬁnity iron uptake (Schrettl et al., 2004a), and
(iii) genome-wide expression proﬁling demonstrated induction
of both the siderophore system and RIA during murine infection
(McDonagh et al., 2008). Consistently, RIA has been shown to be
crucial for virulence of the siderophore-lacking species C. albicans
and C. neoformans (Ramanan and Wang, 2000; Jung et al., 2008).
The siderophore system is important not only for extra, but
also for intracellular growth as defects in the siderophore sys-
tem decrease intracellular growth and survival of A. fumigatus
after phagocytosis by murine alveolar macrophages, which rep-
resent the ﬁrst line of defense in the lung during pulmonary
aspergillosis (Schrettl et al., 2010b). Furthermore, impairment of
SB changes the immune response of macrophages after phago-
cytosis of A. fumigatus (Seifert et al., 2008). In agreement, the
siderophore system is also critical for virulence of Histoplasma
capsulatum, a dimorphic fungal pathogen replicating in the yeast
form within macrophages (Hwang et al., 2008). The evolutionary
conserved role of siderophores in virulence has been conﬁrmed in
various other aspergillosis infection models, i.e., a murine cuta-
neous model, Drosophila melanogaster, and Galleria mellonella
(Ben-Ami et al., 2010; Chamilos et al., 2010; Slater et al., 2011).
Moreover, SB is indispensable for the virulence of various phy-
topathogenic ascomycetes (Oide et al., 2006; Greenshields et al.,
2007). In contrast, SB is dispensable and RIA is essential for phy-
topathogenicity of U. maydis (Mei et al., 1993; Eichhorn et al.,
2006).

INTEGRATION OF THE SIDEROPHORE-BIOSYNTHETIC
PATHWAY IN THE GENERAL METABOLISM
During iron starvation, siderophore production reaches up to 10%
of the biomass. In addition, iron starvation dramatically remodels

the free amino acid pool of A. fumigatus with eight amino acids
increasing and three amino acids decreasing more than 1.5-fold
(Schrettl et al., 2010a). Among these changes, the approximate sev-
enfold increase of the siderophore precursor ornithine during iron
starvation compared to sufﬁciency indicates that the enormous
ornithine demand for SB is matched by active upregulation of
biosynthesis and not by de-repression via its consumption. Con-
sistently, blocking siderophore-mediated ornithine consumption
by inactivation of SidA (ΔsidA mutant) causes a further 2.9-fold
increase of the ornithine pool during iron starvation (Schrettl et al.,
2010a).

Ornithine is produced in the mitochondrion, and its biosyn-
thetic pathway as well as export via the transporter AmcA to the
cytosol is transcriptionally upregulated under iron deprivation
(Schrettl et al., 2010a; Figure 2). Moreover, ornithine is a pre-
cursor of arginine and the conversion of arginine to ornithine
in the cytosol by the arginase AgaA is likewise upregulated in
response to iron starvation. The metabolic commitment required
for siderophore production must however be balanced against the
need to maintain other cellular functions as arginine itself is vital
for protein biosynthesis. Recently, arginine was found to allosteri-
cally activate SidA enzyme activity (Frederick et al., 2011), which
appears to connect siderophore production to cellular amino acid
homeostasis: SB is stimulated only if the cytosolic arginine pool is
sufﬁcient for all of the cell’s needs.

Consistent with mevalonate being a precursor for TAFC biosyn-
thesis (Figure 2), overexpression of the mevalonate-producing
HMG-CoA reductase Hmg1 increases TAFC production, while
lovastatin-mediated Hmg1 inhibition blocks TAFC biosynthesis
in A. fumigatus (Yasmin et al., 2011). Mevalonate is an interme-
diate of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway with ergosterol as
the major product, which is one major target of antifungal treat-
ment, i.e., amphotericin B and azoles. In contrast to siderophore
production, iron starvation decreases the cellular ergosterol level
due to the iron-requirement of ergosterol biosynthesis (Yasmin
et al., 2011). Concordant with bilateral demand for mevalonate,
blocking mevalonate consumption for TAFC biosynthesis (ΔsidI
mutant) alters the sterol composition and increases lovastatin
resistance during iron starvation (Yasmin et al., 2011). These
data demonstrate that statins such as lovastatin, which are widely
used as cholesterol-decreasing drugs, have an additional target in
siderophore-producing fungi. As SB is crucial for virulence statins
might be useful to combat infections with siderophore-producing
fungi.

REGULATION OF IRON METABOLISM AND ITS ROLE IN
VIRULENCE
Iron starvation has been shown to cause extensive transcriptional
remodeling in A. fumigatus with about 13% of the genes respond-
ing to iron availability (Schrettl et al., 2008, 2010a). As shown
in Figure 3, in both A. fumigatus and A. nidulans maintenance
of iron homeostasis involves the two central transcription fac-
tors (TF) SreA and HapX (Haas et al., 1999; Hortschansky et al.,
2007; Schrettl et al., 2008, 2010a). During iron sufﬁciency, the
GATA-factor SreA, postulated by bioinformatic analyses to recog-
nize the consensus sequence ATCWGATAA, represses high-afﬁnity
iron uptake, including RIA and the siderophore system, to avoid

iron toxicity (Schrettl et al., 2008). During iron starvation, the
bZip-TF HapX represses iron-consuming pathways such as heme
biosynthesis, respiration, and ribosome biogenesis to spare iron
(Oberegger et al., 2001, 2002; Schrettl et al., 2008, 2010a). Fur-
thermore, HapX activates synthesis of the ribotoxin AspF1 and
siderophores in A. fumigatus, the latter partly by coordinating
SB with supply of its precursor ornithine (Schrettl et al., 2010a).
The metabolic deregulation caused by deﬁciency in either SreA
or HapX causes reddish hyphal pigmentation (Figure 3). SreA
and HapX are interconnected in a negative feed-back loop: SreA
represses expression of hapX during iron sufﬁciency, while HapX
represses sreA during iron starvation. Additionally, both SreA and
HapX appear to be regulated posttranslationally by iron blocking
HapX function and activating SreA function (Haas et al., 1999;
Hortschansky et al., 2007). In S. pombe, posttranslational iron
sensing by the HapX and SreA orthologs involves the monothiol
glutaredoxin Grx4 (Mercier and Labbe, 2009; Jbel et al., 2011; Kim
et al., 2011). In A. nidulans and A. fumigatus, inactivation of both
HapX and SreA is synthetically lethal underlining the critical role
of iron homeostasis in cellular survival (Hortschansky et al., 2007;
Schrettl et al., 2008, 2010a). In agreement with their expression
pattern and mode of action, detrimental effects of inactivation of
SreA or HapX are conﬁned to growth during iron sufﬁciency or
starvation, respectively (Figure 3). Deﬁciency in HapX, but not
SreA, attenuates virulence of A. fumigatus in murine models of
aspergillosis (Schrettl et al., 2008, 2010a), which emphasizes the
crucial role of adaptation to iron limitation in virulence. Most fun-
gal species possess orthologs to SreA and HapX and the important
role of HapX orthologs in virulence has been demonstrated in C.
albicans and C. neoformans (Labbe et al., 2007; Haas et al., 2008;

Jung et al., 2010; Hsu et al., 2011). Similar to A. fumigatus, the SreA
ortholog Sfu1 is dispensable for systemic virulence of C. albicans
(Chen et al., 2011). However, Sfu1 is crucial for persistence of this
commensal in the iron-rich gut, which impressively illustrates the
importance of adaptation to opposing conditions of iron avail-
ability for survival. Remarkably, the fungal prototype S. cerevisiae
lacks orthologs of SreA, HapX, and SrbA and employs entirely dif-
ferent regulators, Aft1/2 and Cth1/2, which are conserved only in
closely related Saccharomycotina species (Haas et al., 2008; Kaplan
and Kaplan, 2009).

INTERCONNECTION OF IRON METABOLISM WITH OTHER
REGULATORY CIRCUITS: OXYGEN, REDOX PH,
GLUCONEOGENESIS, MAP KINASE SIGNALING, ZINC
Due to the central metabolic role of iron, a variety of regulatory
circuits affect cellular iron handling. As obligate aerobic organ-
isms,Aspergilli rely on respiration, which is highly iron-dependent.
Therefore, oxygen supply largely inﬂuences iron metabolism and
vice versa. Recently, proteomic analysis of A. fumigatus revealed
that hypoxia increases the production of proteins involved in
glycolysis, the TCA-cycle, and respiration, which is paralleled by
increased cellular iron, heme, copper, and zinc contents (Vodisch
et al., 2009). The increase in iron/heme is attributable to the
iron/heme-dependence of the TCA-cycle and respiration. In A.
fumigatus, hypoxic adaptation involves SrbA, a member of the
“sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)” TF fam-
ily, which is conserved in most eukaryotes (Willger et al., 2008).
These TFs are activated by cellular sterol-depletion to maintain
sterol homeostasis (Bien and Espenshade, 2010). In A. fumi-
gatus, SrbA-deﬁciency decreases the cellular ergosterol content

The iron link of Aspergillus fumigatus virulence

and resistance against azole drugs and blocks hypoxic growth
as well as virulence (Willger et al., 2008). Recently, SrbA was
found to activate siderophore-mediated iron uptake in response
to hypoxia and iron starvation in part by transcriptional acti-
vation of HapX (Blatzer et al., 2011a). In agreement with SrbA
being involved in iron homeostasis, defects in hypoxic growth
and azole resistance caused by SrbA-deﬁciency are at least par-
tially cured by increased iron supplementation and in particular
by de-repression of iron uptake via simultaneous inactivation
of SreA (Blatzer et al., 2011a). SrbA is transcriptionally upreg-
ulated during hypoxia and iron starvation, in both cases likely in
response to sterol-depletion and autoregulation as sterol biosyn-
thesis depends on both oxygen and iron. During iron starvation,
consumption of the sterol intermediate mevalonate by SB might
play an additional role (see above). In agreement, the transcrip-
tional activation of SrbA during iron starvation is independent of
SreA and HapX. These data indicate that A. fumigatus senses iron
not only via HapX and SreA but also via ergosterol biosynthesis
and SrbA. Taken together, SrbA coordinates ergosterol biosyn-
thesis and iron metabolism to mediate hypoxia responses and
azole resistance. Growth defects during iron starvation of respec-
tive gene deletion mutants indicate similar functions in iron
homeostasis of the SrbA orthologs in S. pombe and C. neofor-
mans (Hughes et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2007). Moreover, the
SrbA ortholog is also crucial for virulence in C. neoformans
(Chun et al., 2007). Consequently, the virulence defect of SrbA
mutants is possibly attributable not only to the defects in adap-
tation to hypoxia, but also iron starvation. S. cerevisiae lacks an
SrbA ortholog and the TFs mediating hypoxic adaptation (Hap1,
Mot1, Rox1) are not conserved in Aspergilli (Willger et al., 2008),
which might be explained by S. cerevisiae being an facultative
anaerobe.

As shown in A. nidulans, HapX functions via physical inter-
action with the DNA-binding CCAAT-binding complex (CBC;
Hortschansky et al., 2007). The CBC is a heterotrimeric DNA-
binding complex, which is conserved in all eukaryotes. In A.
nidulans, inactivation of either one of its subunits, HapB, HapC, or
HapE phenocopies HapX inactivation with respect to the defects
in adaptation to iron starvation. However, the CBC has HapX-
independent functions and is speculated to affect expression of
about 30% of all genes. Consistently, CBC-deﬁciency results in
decreased growth and sporulation during both iron sufﬁciency
and starvation (Hortschansky et al., 2007). The mode of dis-
crimination between HapX targets and the remaining CBC tar-
gets remains to be elucidated. As mentioned in the introduction,
iron metabolism and oxidative stress are intimately intertwined.
Therefore it is particularly interesting that, as shown in A. nidu-
lans, the CBC senses the redox state of the cell via oxidation
and thioredoxin-mediated reduction of evolutionary conserved
thiol groups within the HapC histone fold motif (Thon et al.,
2010). Oxidation blocks CBC formation and nuclear localiza-
tion. In line with a role in redox regulation, CBC-deﬁciency
impairs the oxidative stress response. The impact of iron avail-
ability on the oxidative stress detoxiﬁcation system is indicated by
iron starvation-mediated transcriptional downregulation of the
heme-dependent hyphal catalase B (CatB) and upregulation by the
Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SodA; Oberegger et al., 2000, 2001).

Excessive iron uptake caused by SreA-deﬁciency transcriptionally
upregulates both enzymes (Oberegger et al., 2001).

The ambient pH impacts iron availability as alkaline condi-
tions decrease iron solubility. In line, neutral compared to acidic
conditions upregulate SB and uptake in A. nidulans mediated by
the pH-reactive TF PacC (Eisendle et al., 2004). Similarly, PacC
orthologs mediate upregulation of high-afﬁnity iron uptake – in
these species RIA – during alkaline conditions in S. cerevisiae, C.
albicans, and C. neoformans (Lamb et al., 2001; Baek et al., 2008).
Virulence of C. albicans but not C. neoformans depends on its
PacC ortholog, which is most likely attributable to the occupation
of different host niches by these two pathogens (Nobile et al., 2008;
O’Meara et al., 2010).

Interestingly, deﬁciency in the TF AcuM, which is required for
gluconeogenesis, decreases siderophore production in A. fumiga-
tus, but not in A. nidulans, and attenuates virulence in A. fumigatus
(Liu et al., 2010). Though it is unclear if its effects are direct, AcuM
appears to transcriptionally repress SreA.

Recently, iron starvation was found to trigger phosphorylation
and nuclear localization of the A. fumigatus mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) MpkA, which is involved in maintaining
cell wall integrity, protection against ROS, and secondary metab-
olism (Jain et al., 2011). Moreover, MpkA-deﬁciency increases
siderophore production. The TF targeted by MpkA signaling
remains to be identiﬁed. Remarkably, despite its dramatic effect
on in vitro growth rate, MpkA-deﬁciency does not affect virulence
of A. fumigatus (Valiante et al., 2008).

Similar to iron, zinc plays a critical role in a diverse array of
biochemical processes, but excess of zinc is deleterious. Conse-
quently, regulation of zinc homeostasis by the TF ZafA is essen-
tial for virulence of A. fumigatus. Iron starvation causes zinc
hypersensitive and therefore iron depletion changes cellular zinc
handling by downregulating zinc uptake and upregulation of vac-
uolar zinc detoxiﬁcation (Yasmin et al., 2009). HapX appears to
play a critical role in coordination of zinc and iron homeostasis
as its deﬁciency causes zinc hypersensitivity during iron starva-
tion. These data demonstrate the importance of cellular metal
balancing.

CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
The understanding of the role of iron in fungal pathogenic-
ity has advanced enormously in recent years. Together with the
transcriptional upregulation of the high-afﬁnity iron acquisi-
tion systems during initiation of murine infection (McDonagh
et al., 2008), the attenuated virulence caused by defects in SB
or HapX conﬁrms that A. fumigatus faces iron limitation during
mammalian infection. Thus, human protection against A. fumiga-
tus includes growth inhibition by polymorphonuclear leukocytes
via lactoferrin-mediated iron depletion and possibly siderocalin-
mediated scavenging of siderophores (Fluckinger et al., 2004;
Zarember et al., 2007). On the other hand, increased bone mar-
row iron stores represent an independent risk factor for invasive
aspergillosis (Kontoyiannis et al., 2007).

The current difﬁculties

in diagnosis and treatment of
aspergillosis are reﬂected by the high mortality rate of this infec-
tious disease (Tekaia and Latge, 2005). The essentiality of iron

The iron link of Aspergillus fumigatus virulence

like Aspergilli might help to improve therapy and diagnosis of
fungal infections. Speciﬁcally, the unique fungal siderophore sys-
tem represents a promising target for selective therapeutic inter-
vention. Noteworthy, SIT constitute one of few protein fami-
lies that are unique to fungi (Hsiang and Baillie, 2005). Their
absence in prokaryotes and other eukaryotes might enable spe-
ciﬁc inhibition or drug delivery during infection by a “Trojan
horse” approach (Miller et al., 2009), whereby antifungal agents
are covalently attached to siderophores and selectively imported
by fungi.

Moreover,

the enzymatic and regulatory links between
siderophore and ergosterol biosynthetic pathways might be crucial
for optimization of treatment of infections caused by siderophore-
producing fungi. The potential of iron chelation therapy is indi-

cated by the synergistic effect of iron chelators and antifungal
drugs demonstrated in vitro and in a murine aspergillosis model
(Zarember et al., 2009; Ibrahim et al., 2010). Moreover, the recently
demonstrated imaging of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a rat
model, based on positron emission tomography (PET)-visualized
fungal accumulation of TAFC-chelated 68Gallium, emphasizes the
potential of siderophores in diagnosis of fungal infections (Petrik
et al., 2010a,b).
