Flow cytometric analysis is a reliable and convenient method for investigating molecules
at the single cell level. Previously, recombinant human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1
(HIV-1) strains were constructed that express a ﬂuorescent reporter, either enhanced
green ﬂuorescent protein, or DsRed, which allow the monitoring of HIV-1-infected cells by
ﬂow cytometry. The present study further investigated the potential of these recombinant
viruses in terms of whether the HIV-1 ﬂuorescent reporters would be helpful in evaluating
viral replication based on ﬂuorescence intensity. When primary CD4+ T cells were infected
with recombinant viruses, the ﬂuorescent reporter intensity measured by ﬂow cytometry
was associated with the level of CD4 downmodulation and Gag p24 expression in infected
cells. Interestingly, some HIV-1-infected cells, in which CD4 was only moderately down-
modulated, were reporter-positive but Gag p24-negative. Furthermore, when the activation
status of primary CD4+ T cells was modulated by T cell receptor-mediated stimulation, we
conﬁrmed the preferential viral production upon strong stimulation and showed that the
intensity of the ﬂuorescent reporter within a proportion of HIV-1-infected cells was cor-
related with the viral replication level. These ﬁndings indicate that a ﬂuorescent reporter
encoded within HIV-1 is useful for the sensitive detection of productively infected cells at
different stages of infection and for evaluating cell-associated viral replication at the single
cell level.

INTRODUCTION
Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) interacts with
its primary receptor, CD4, and a co-receptor, usually CCR5
or CXCR4, to infect T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells
(Mcclure et al., 1987; Berger et al., 1999; Tsunetsugu-Yokota,
2008). Single cell analysis of HIV-1-infected cells is an essen-
tial approach to investigate the differential dynamics of HIV-
1 infection and the cellular consequences for each of
the
HIV-1-targeted cell populations. To monitor HIV-1 infection,
a recombinant HIV-1 encoding a reporter luciferase (Luc)
gene, or indicator cells transduced with enzymatic reporters
such as Luc, β-galactosidase, alkaline phosphatase, and chlo-
ramphenicol acetyl transferase, incorporated downstream of the
HIV-1 long terminal repeats (LTR) have been widely used
(Kar-Roy et al., 2000). However, these reporters require addi-
tional substrates or co-factors, and lysis or ﬁxation of cells is
required to show reporter activity, which makes the experimen-
tal process more complex. In addition, it is difﬁcult to distin-
guish infected cells from uninfected cells using these reporter
assays.

An alternative molecule, green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)
and/or its derivatives, is a powerful reporter that does not require
any substrates and co-factors to generate a reporter signal (Chal-
ﬁe, 1995; Cubitt et al., 1995; Heim et al., 1995). Page et al. (1997)
ﬁrst used a GFP derivative, called enhanced green ﬂuorescent pro-
tein (EGFP), as a ﬂuorescent reporter molecule for HIV-1 and
showed that infected cells were detectable and, more importantly,
distinguishable from uninfected cells using ﬂow cytometry. Fur-
thermore, a red ﬂuorescent protein, DsRed, has been used as an
HIV-1 ﬂuorescent reporter (Weber et al., 2006). The main ben-
eﬁt of such recombinant HIV-1 molecules is that the targeted
cells do not require any modulation (e.g., transfection) of exoge-
nous reporter genes and, therefore, they allow the characterization
of intact HIV-1-infected cells. In most cases of previous recom-
binant HIV-1 strains, the nef gene was replaced with a reporter
gene. Therefore, we previously constructed nef-intact, replication-
competent, recombinant HIV-1 strains encoding either EGFP
or DsRed, and showed that CXCR4-tropic X4 and CCR5-tropic
+
R5 viruses replicate differently in CD4
T cells simultaneously
infected with X4 HIV-1 encoding EGFP and R5 HIV-1 encoding

Application of HIV-1 ﬂuorescent reporters

DsRed (Yamamoto et al., 2009). Such recombinant HIV-1 strains
encoding a ﬂuorescent reporter gene will be even more valuable
because of recent advances in multicolor ﬂow cytometry, which
permit more detailed characterization of HIV-1-infected cells.

Flow cytometry is a reliable and convenient method for analy-
sis at the single cell level. Because the transcriptional activity of
HIV-1 can be quantitatively monitored in indicator cells accord-
ing to the ﬂuorescence intensity of an EGFP reporter driven by the
HIV-1 LTR (Dorsky et al., 1996; Gervaix et al., 1997; Kar-Roy et al.,
2000), we investigated whether the HIV-1-expressing ﬂuorescent
reporters EGFP and DsRed would allow the quantitative evalua-
tion of viral replication using a ﬂow cytometer. The results show
that a ﬂuorescent reporter signal generated by recombinant HIV-1
strains enables the detection of infected cells at various stages of
the viral life cycle.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CELL PREPARATION
Human peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy
donors after written informed consent. Sample collection was
approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of the National
Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID; Tokyo, Japan). Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated on a Ficoll–
Hypaque density gradient (Lymphosepal; IBL, Gunma, Japan)
and CD4
T cells were negatively selected from the PBMCs
using an EasySep Human CD4
T cell Enrichment Kit (StemCell
Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada).

+

+

CEM cells stably expressing human CCR5 (CEM–CCR5)
were established by transducing CEM cells with the human
ccr5 gene using a conventional mouse retrovirus system. CEM–
CCR5 cells were maintained in complete RPMI medium
(10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin,
100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine) supplemented
with 1 μg/ml puromycin at 37˚C.

PREPARATION OF HIV-1 VIRUS STOCKS
We previously constructed pNL432-based proviral clones encod-
ing EGFP (pNL-E) or DsRed (pNL-D) for X4-tropic HIV-1NL-E
or HIV-1NL-D, respectively, and pNLAD8-based proviral clones
encoding EGFP (pNLAD8-E) or DsRed (pNLAD8-D) for R5-
tropic HIV-1NLAD8-E or HIV-1NLAD8-D, respectively (Yamamoto
et al., 2009; Figure 1). To prepare the HIV-1 viral stocks, the human
embryonic kidney cell line 293T was transfected with pNL-E, pNL-
D, pNLAD8-E, or pNLAD8-D using the calcium phosphate precip-
itation method and then incubated for 48 h. Culture supernatants
were ﬁltered and frozen at−80˚C. The amount of virus in each cul-
ture supernatant was measured using an in-house HIV-1 Gag p24
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Tsunetsugu-Yokota
et al., 1995).

STIMULATION OF T CELL RECEPTORS
T cell receptors (TCR) were stimulated as described previously
(Yamamoto et al., 2009) with some modiﬁcations. In brief, primary
CD4
T cells were suspended in complete RPMI medium supple-
mented with 5% human plasma and stimulated with 5 μg/ml of
immobilized anti-human CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb; eBio-
science, San Diego, CA) and 1 μg/ml of soluble anti-human CD28

clones encoded EGFP (pNL-E) or DsRed (pNL-D) for X4-tropic HIV-1NL-E or

EGFP (pNLAD8-E) or DsRed (pNLAD8-D) for R5-tropic HIV-1NLAD8-E or
HIV-1NLAD8-D, respectively. EGFP or DsRed was not expressed as a fusion
protein with Env due to the insertion of a single base after the Env stop
codon. Nef was also independently expressed under the control of IRES. t

HIV-1 INFECTION AND CELL CULTURE
Primary CD4
(either unstimulated or pre-TCR-
stimulated) or CEM–CCR5 cells were infected with 200 ng of
p24-measured amounts of HIV-1NL-E, HIV-1NL-D, HIV-1NLAD8-E,
or HIV-1NLAD8-D per 1× 106 cells by spinoculation at 1200× g

+

for 2 h at 25 (conventional conditions) or 4˚C (for CEM–CCR5
cells), as described previously (O’doherty et al., 2000; Dai et al.,
2009). After spinoculation, cells were washed three times with PBS.
Primary CD4
T cells were then suspended in complete RPMI
medium supplemented with 5% human plasma. The cell suspen-
+
sions derived from unstimulated or pre-TCR-stimulated CD4
T cells were settled onto U-bottom, 96-well plates with or with-
out TCR-stimulation, respectively, at 37˚C for 24 h. After the 24 h
culture, cells were washed three times with PBS, suspended in com-
plete RPMI medium supplemented with 5% human plasma and
50 U/ml recombinant interleukin-2, and cultured in U-bottom,
96-well plates at 37˚C for up to 4 days.

FLOW CYTOMETRY
Cells were stained with ﬂuorescence-conjugated mAbs as
described previously (Yamamoto et al., 2009). The following mAbs
were used for ﬂow cytometry in various combinations: Paciﬁc
Blue-conjugated anti-human CD3 mAb (BioLegend, San Diego,
CA, USA), phycoerythrin Cy7-conjugated anti-human CD4 mAb
(BioLegend), and Alexa Fluor 700-conjugated anti-human CD8a
mAb (BioLegend); and Nu24 mAb speciﬁc for HIV-1 Gag p24
(kindly provided by Dr. T. Sata, NIID, Tokyo, Japan) and conju-
gated to Alexa Fluor 647 using an Alexa Fluor 647 Protein Labeling
Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). Dead cells were stained
with propidium iodide or a LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain

Kit (L34957; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Intracellular stain-
ing (ICS) by Nu24 mAb was performed using a FIX and PERM
Fixation and Permeabilization Kit (Invitrogen). Data collection
was performed using a FACSCanto II (BD Bioscience, San Diego,
CA, USA) and the data were analyzed using FACSDiva software
(BD Bioscience) and FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA,
USA).

QUANTIFICATION OF REPLICATED HIV-1 IN CELL CULTURE
SUPERNATANTS
Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 replication was quantiﬁed
in cell culture supernatants by ELISA and real-time RT-PCR. Gag
p24 was measured using a RETRO-TEK HIV-1 p24 Antigen ELISA
(ZeptoMetrix Corporation, Buffalo, NY, USA). For real-time RT-
PCR, viral RNA was extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and subjected to real-time RT-PCR
using a SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR
System (Invitrogen), a set of HIV-1 gag -targeted primers, and a
TaqMan probe as previously described (Saito et al., 2010). PCR
was performed in an Mx3000P (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA).

for Gag p24 in HIV-1-infected cells prepared as described above.
When we observed X4-tropic HIV-1NL-E-infected and HIV-1NL-D-
infected cells from three donors by ﬂow cytometry, we noticed
that ﬁxation/permeabilization, an essential step for ICS, weak-
ened the ﬂuorescent reporter signal for both EGFP and DsRed.
Figure 3 shows the ﬂow cytometry proﬁles obtained for EGFP and
DsRed at identical photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages between
intact (untreated) cells and ﬁxed/permeabilized cells to visualize
the differences in ﬂuorescent reporter intensity. DsRed
cells were
not properly separated from DsRed
cells within the population
+
treated by ﬁxation/permeabilization; the frequency of DsRed
cells was, therefore, markedly decreased. No adjustment of the ﬂow
cytometer settings, including PMT voltage and compensation,
improved the blunted ﬂuorescent reporter signal generated after
+
ﬁxation/permeabilization. Nevertheless, the number of EGFP
cells within the intact cell and ﬁxed/permeabilized cell populations
was comparable. Similar results were obtained for R5-tropic HIV-
1NLAD8-E and HIV-1NLAD8-D (data not shown). Taken together,
these results indicate that it is preferable to use an EGFP reporter
when the ﬁxation/permeabilization of cells is required.

RESULTS
CD4 DOWNMODULATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIV-1 FLUORESCENT
REPORTER INTENSITY
The cell surface CD4 molecule is downmodulated in HIV-1-
infected cells in response to the HIV-1 components Env, Nef,
and Vpu (Malim and Emerman, 2008). Therefore, to investi-
gate the correlation between the level of CD4 downmodulation
and the HIV-1 ﬂuorescent reporter intensity, primary CD4
T
cells infected with HIV-1NL-E, HIV-1NL-D, HIV-1NLAD8-E, or HIV-
1NLAD8-D followed by TCR-stimulation for 1 day and cultivation
for a further 4 days were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. As shown in
Figure 2 (left panels), HIV-1-infected cells expressing a ﬂuores-
cent reporter signal, EGFP, or DsRed, were detected, although the
numbers varied between individual donors (n = 3–4): about 10–
30% for X4-tropic HIV-1NL-E-infected and HIV-1NL-D-infected
cells and 1–10% for R5-tropic HIV-1NLAD8-E-infected and HIV-
1NLAD8-D-infected cells. However, the number of HIV-1
cells
was comparable between HIV-1NL-E and HIV-1NL-D (X4-tropic),
and between HIV-1NLAD8-E and HIV-1NLAD8-D (R5-tropic) within
each donor, showing that the ﬂuorescent reporter genes encoded
within the HIV-1 proviral genome did not affect HIV-1 infectivity
as described previously (Yamamoto et al., 2009). When we cate-
+
gorized CD3
T cells into three fractions (HIV-1-negative,
-dull, and -high) based on the ﬂuorescence intensity of EGFP and
DsRed, we found that CD4 was strongly downmodulated in the
HIV-1 high fraction in all the HIV-1 strains (Figure 2, right pan-
els). Interestingly, CD4 was also downmodulated in the HIV-1
dull fraction, but the level was modest compared with that in the
HIV-1 high fraction (Figure 2, right panels). These results indicate
that the level of CD4 downmodulation is associated with HIV-1
ﬂuorescent reporter intensity.

Following the results shown in Figure 3, we next assessed viral
replication levels in the HIV-1NL-E infection group (5 days culture)
from six donors using Gag p24 ICS (Figure 4). A representative

cells were

and vice versa. When CD4 expression levels were compared
in each of the four cell fractions based on the expression patterns

of EGFP and Gag p24 (EGFP

and EGFP
), the strongest downmodulation of CD4 was

observed in EGFP
cells (red fraction). CD4 downmodula-
+
tion was moderate in EGFP
cells (green fraction). However,
CD4 was not downmodulated at all in EGFP
cells (blue
fraction) and the expression level of CD4 was the same as that

in EGFP
cells (black fraction). We further divided the

cells (red fraction) into Gaghi (brown fraction) and
EGFP
Gaglo cells (pink fraction) and compared the expression levels of
EGFP and CD4 with those of Gag p24. Gaghi cells (brown frac-
tion) showed the strongest expression of EGFP and the strongest
downmodulation of CD4. Gaglo cells (pink fraction) showed an
intermediate level of EGFP expression [between that of Gaghi cells
(brown fraction) and that of EGFP
cells (green fraction)]
and CD4 expression [between that of Gaghi cells (brown fraction)
and EGFP
cells (black fraction)]. These results indicate that
the expression level of EGFP correlates with that of Gag p24 in
HIV-1-infected cells in which CD4 is downmodulated.

CEM–CCR5 cells, which are almost as susceptible to X4 and

Gag p24 ICS did indeed detect HIV-1-bound cells. Also, because
it has been suggested that spinoculation at 25˚C may induce
HIV-1 fusion to the targeted cells (Dai et al., 2009), we tested
Gag p24 ICS using CEM–CCR5 cells immediately after spin-
oculation with X4-tropic HIV-1NL-E or R5-tropic HIV-1AD8-E

at 4˚C. When cells were not ﬁxed/permeabilized, no Gag p24

cells were detected by ﬂow cytometry (Figure 5B, upper pan-
els); however, when cells were ﬁxed/permeabilized, a substantial
proportion of Gag
cells was detectable in both the HIV-1NL-E
and HIV-1AD8-E infection groups (Figure 5B, lower panels). Taken
together, these results indicate that cells that have bound or inter-
nalized HIV-1 can be detected using ﬂow cytometry for Gag p24
ICS.

T cells from
four donors were individually pre-stimulated via the TCR for 4
(weak stimulation) or 24 h (strong stimulation), infected with
HIV-1NL-E, and then cultured for a further 3 days. First, we con-
ﬁrmed that this experimental protocol allowed the preferential
production of HIV-1NL-E upon strong stimulation in all donors by
examining the cell culture supernatants by ELISA (Figure 6A) and
real-time RT-PCR (Figure 6B). Flow cytometric analysis of intact
cells showed that HIV-1NL-E
) cells were more preva-
lent after strong stimulation than after weak stimulation, although
the proportion of HIV-1NL-E
cells varied among individuals
(Figure 6C, upper and middle panels). The PMT voltage was opti-
mized for EGFP to prevent excessive EGFP signaling (Figures 2
and 3). Of note, EGFP expression by HIV-1NL-E
cells was lower in
the weak stimulation group than in the strong stimulation group
(as observed in donors #4 and #5), and EGFP expression in the
weak stimulation group approached that in the strong stimulation
+
group in parallel with the increase in the number of HIV-1NL-E
cells (as observed in donors #6 and #7; Figure 6C, lower pan-
els). Taken together, these results show that the intensity of the
ﬂuorescent reporter is highly correlated with the viral replication
level.

DISCUSSION
Flow cytometric analysis is a reliable and convenient method for
detecting HIV-1-infected cells at a single cell level. Here, we stud-
ied the potential usefulness of several HIV-1 ﬂuorescent reporters
that have been published previously (Yamamoto et al., 2009). We
examined whether they would be helpful for evaluating viral repli-
cation levels based on their ﬂuorescence intensity. In this study,
we used recombinant HIV-1 encoding either EGFP or DsRed
to show that the ﬂuorescence intensity of the EGFP and DsRed
reporters was associated with the level of CD4 downmodulation
(Figure 2). Furthermore, we showed that EGFP intensity was asso-
ciated with the expression level of Gag p24 (Figure 4). These
ﬁndings clearly indicate that ﬂuorescent reporter intensity is useful
for evaluating viral replication levels. To conﬁrm this argument,
we further compared the ﬂuorescent reporter intensity of HIV-
1-infected cells that were strongly or weakly stimulated via the
TCR. As expected, higher levels of HIV-1 replication/production
occurred in strongly stimulated cells from all the donors tested
(Figure 6A,B). Although the proportion and EGFP intensity of
the HIV-1-infected cells varied among individuals, this might be
due to differing susceptibility to HIV-1 and/or TCR-stimulation.
Thus, the variability in EGFP expression is rather favorable to
our argument, as increased EGFP intensity was associated with
an increase in the number of HIV-1-infected cells after weak
stimulation (Figure 6C).

Although Gag p24 ICS is usually used for ﬂow cytomet-
ric analysis of other markers, we showed that it can also be
used to detect cells that have internalized or bound HIV-1
(Figure 5A,B). However, Gag p24 ICS did not appear sensi-
tive enough to detect HIV-1-infected cells because some HIV-
1-infected cells in which CD4 was moderately downmodulated
were identiﬁed as positive for EGFP but negative for Gag p24
(Figure 4). Bosque and Planelles (2009) also identiﬁed a small
population of such reporter-positive but Gag p24-negative cells

+

by ﬂow cytometry when CD4
T cells were infected with EGFP-
encoded DHIV incorporating a small out-of-frame deletion in
the gp120-encoding area and pseudotyped with X4-tropic HIV-
1LAI, and assumed that these cells were at an early stage of the
infection process and did not display late viral proteins. There-
fore, our own ﬁndings indicate that it is the HIV-1 ﬂuorescent
reporter, rather than Gag p24 staining, that reliably detects HIV-
1-infected cells at different stages of infection in ﬂow cytometry
experiments.

cells than in EGFP

It is known that maturation of DsRed for coloration is usually
slower compared with EGFP (Bevis and Glick, 2002; Maruyama
et al., 2004). When we focused on the HIV-1 dull fraction in
Figure 2, we found that CD4 downmodulation was stronger in
+
DsRed
cells. These results suggest that
the EGFP reporter is preferable to the DsRed reporter for detec-
tion of earlier stage of infection. Furthermore, the detrimental
effect of ﬁxation/permeabilization on ﬂuorescent reporter inten-
sity, particularly when using the DsRed reporter, should be noted
(Figure 3). Although the detailed mechanism remains obscure,
this may result from the lower ﬂuorescence intensity of DsRed
compared with EGFP. A similar phenomenon was described
regarding ﬁxation with 3% paraformaldehyde, which signiﬁcantly
decreases the ﬂuorescence intensity of DsRed, although speciﬁc
data were not provided (Weber et al., 2006). Regardless of the
weakened signal, the EGFP reporter is still compatible with ﬁx-
ation/permeabilization because the proportion of EGFP
cells
was comparable between intact cells and ﬁxated/permeabilized
cells (Figure 3). Therefore, the EGFP reporter still maintains an
advantage for analyses of cytokine/chemokine production and
proliferation assays based on Ki-67 expression, for which ICS is
necessary.

The HIV-1 ﬂuorescent reporter has a potential applica-
tion in molecular biology. In general, ICS-treated cells are not
suitable for analysis using molecular biology techniques, since
formaldehyde-based ﬁxation (required for ICS) makes RNA
extraction and reverse transcription and quantiﬁcation problem-
atic (Farragher et al., 2008) because of chemical cross-linking
of proteins and nucleic acids (Kuykendall and Bogdanffy, 1992;
Finke et al., 1993; Park et al., 1996), degradation of RNA
(Bresters et al., 1994), and covalent modiﬁcation of RNA via
the addition of monomethylol groups to the bases (Masuda
et al., 1999); therefore, by using the HIV-1 ﬂuorescent reporter,
HIV-1-infected cells can be sorted/puriﬁed without the need
for ﬁxation, allowing further characterization at a molecular
level.

Given the usefulness of the HIV-1 ﬂuorescent reporter shown
here, it would also be very useful for investigating the mecha-
nisms involved in the selective replication of R5 HIV-1 over X4
HIV-1 during the acute phase in vivo (Wolinsky et al., 1992;
Zhu et al., 1993; van’t Wout et al., 1994) and in cell culture sys-
tems in vitro (Schweighardt et al., 2004; Roy et al., 2005). We
previously developed an in vitro dual infection model using EGFP-
encoded X4 HIV-1 (HIV-1NL-E) and DsRed-encoded R5 HIV-1
(HIV-1AD8-D) and showed that the increase in the proportion of
X4 HIV-1-infected cells is dependent upon their activation level
(Yamamoto et al., 2009). Furthermore, the results of the present
study show that the ﬂuorescence intensity of the reporter molecule

Application of HIV-1 ﬂuorescent reporters

can be used to assess the level of viral replication in infected
cells; therefore, by focusing on the HIV-1-infected cells and the
ﬂuorescent reporter intensity in the dual infection model, the
detailed mechanism(s) of HIV-1 infection/pathogenesis can be
clariﬁed. In this regard, we have been investigating the dynamics
of HIV-1 infection in vivo using humanized mice infected simul-
taneously with EGFP-encoded X4 HIV-1 (HIV-1NL-E) and DsRed-
encoded R5 HIV-1 (HIV-1AD8-D; Ishige et al., in preparation). We
believe that the advantages of the recombinant HIV-1 ﬂuorescent

reporter will contribute to the further understanding of HIV-1
infection/pathogenesis.
