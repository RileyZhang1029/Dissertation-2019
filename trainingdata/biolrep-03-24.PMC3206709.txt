Abstract
Malaria was estimated to cause 800,000 deaths and 225 million cases worldwide in 2010. Worryingly,
the first-line treatment currently relies on a single drug class called artemisinins, and there are signs
that the parasite is becoming resistant to these drugs. The good news is that new technology has
given us new approaches to drug discovery. New drugs generated this way are probably 10-15 years
away from the clinic. Other antimalarials that may offer hope include those rehabilitated after not
being used for some time, those that act as inhibitors of resistance mechanisms, those that limit
infection while allowing protective immunity to develop, and those which are drugs borrowed from
other disease treatments. All of these offer new hope of turning the tables on malaria. In parallel with
the effort to develop vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission, drugs that target the parasite
during transmission to the mosquito or during its pre-erythrocytic development in the liver, may
allow us to terminate the parasite’s spread.

Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated
800,000 malaria deaths and 225 million cases worldwide
in 2010 [1], with severe disease concentrated among
young children and pregnant women [2]. Geographically,
malaria overlaps with other infectious maladies includ-
ing HIV, which often complicate the illness as well as
treatment options. Worryingly, first-line treatment for
malaria currently relies on a single drug class called
artemisinins, and the existing drug armamentarium is
insufficient to answer the call for malaria eradication.
Under the circumstances, scientists are exploring many
approaches, targeting different stages of the parasite life
cycle, to find agents that will prevent, cure, or eliminate
malaria. These approaches include new drug discovery,
old drug rehabilitation, and drugs borrowed from other
fields for use against malaria.

Malaria parasites: many potential targets, few
effective drugs
Malaria life cycle
Human malaria is transmitted by the bite of female
Anopheles mosquitoes that carry sporozoites (the motile
infective stage of the parasite) in their salivary glands
(Figure 1). Sporozoites inoculated into skin enter blood
vessels and are carried to the liver, where they pass
through Kupffer cells, invade hepatocytes, and multiply
10-thousand-fold over a week to form liver stage mer-
ozoites. Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale parasites
that invade the liver may develop into a dormant form
called hypnozoite that can cause relapse after months or
years. These stages of infection, called the pre-erythrocytic
(pre-blood) stages, are clinically silent. Liver stage mer-
ozoites released into the blood stream infect individual
host red blood cells to initiate the erythrocytic (blood)

blood stage development [3]. In Plasmodium falciparum,
gametocytes appear several days after asexual parasites,
whereas P. vivax gametocytes can appear at the same time
or even before asexual forms in the blood [4].

Malaria drug history
Quinine and its derivatives
The first pharmaceutical used to treat malaria, quinine,
was derived from the tree bark of Cinchona calisaya [5].
Quinine synthesis was first attempted in 1856 by William
Henry Perkins, but synthesis was not successful until 1944.
Although he failed with quinine, Perkins did succeed
in synthesizing “mauve,” the first textile dye, thereby
launching the synthetic textile dye industry in Germany.
Microbiologists adopted these dyes to stain microorgan-
isms, and methylene blue was first found to stain malaria
parasites by Paul Erlich. Erlich hypothesized that methy-
lene blue might therefore kill malaria parasites, and toge-
ther with Paul Guttman successfully treated two malaria
patients with this agent [6]. Indeed, methylene blue was
the predecessor to both the 4-aminoquinolones and the
8-aminoquinolones. Chloroquine is perhaps the most
important of the 4-aminoquinolones, and other related
compounds include the aminophenols amodiaquine and
pyronaridine, and the dimeric 4-aminoquinoline, piper-
aquine. The 8-aminoquinolones including the prototype
pamaquine (which was too toxic and so not used for
long), primaquine (still in use today as the only licensed
drug effective against
the
hypnozoite), and tafenoquine (a drug which is under-
going clinical trials applied as an anti-hypnozoite form
treatment). Other derivatives of quinine include the
arylamino alcohols mefloquine, halofantrine, and lume-
fantrine [7]. Parenteral quinine remains an option for the
treatment of severe malaria, although parenteral artesu-
nate has shown superior efficacy in recent trials [8]. Both
chloroquine and primaquine are synthetic derivatives of
quinine, and their development in the mid-20th century
was largely driven by the need to treat soldiers during the
world wars [9,10]. Each of these drugs, still in use today,
probably act by interfering with the parasite’s ability to
eliminate the toxic by-products of hemoglobin digestion.

the dormant

liver form,

Antifolates
Other drugs have specific enzyme targets in the parasite,
such as the antifolates (e.g. sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine),
which inhibit the parasite’s essential ability to synthesize
tetrahydrofolate used for methylation reactions [4]. Anti-
folates were demonstrated to be effective against malaria as
early as the 1930s, and sulfonamide components with
better pharmacokinetic profiles and partner drugs were
developed over the 1940s and 50s, but antifolates were not
generally used for antimalarial treatment until much later
owing to the availability of highly effective quinine

Sporozoites inoculated into skin enter blood vessels and are carried to the liver,
where they multiply to form liver stage merozoites. Liver stage merozoites
released into the blood stream infect individual host red blood cells to initiate
the erythrocytic (blood) stages. Along with the disease-causing asexual blood
stage parasites, sexual stages, known as gametocytes, also emerge during blood
stage development and serve to transmit the infection to mosquitoes that suck
the blood of infected humans. See [69] for a more in-depth summary.

stages, when clinical symptoms of malaria occur. Untreated
falciparum malaria can rapidly progress to death. Along
with the disease-causing asexual blood stage parasites,
sexual stages known as gametocytes also emerge during

derivatives [6]. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine became avail-
able in 1971 as second-line therapy for malaria, with
resistance developing not long thereafter [11]. Indeed,
resistance to antifolate drugs, for which there is a specific
enzyme target, evolved more rapidly than resistance to
chloroquine [4].

Artemisinin combination therapy
Unfortunately,
the malaria parasite has developed
resistance to all the above drugs in different parts of the
world. In response to this, WHO recommended artemi-
sinin combination therapy in recent years.

Artemisinin, a derivative of sweet wormwood, Artemisia
annua, is a potent drug that rapidly reduces blood stage
parasites, allowing prompt resolution of illness, and
was initially developed in 1972 by the Chinese during
the Vietnam War. Ho Chi Minh personally asked Mao
Zedong for assistance with antimalarials, as North
Vietnamese soldiers were dying from malaria at a higher
rate than from armed conflicts [12]. Artemisinin combi-
nation therapy represented a shift away from mono-
therapy for malaria, which was common previously.
Since artemisinin and its derivatives have very short half-
lives, a second drug with longer half-life is used in
combination to complete the clearance of parasitemia,
and the combination of drugs has the additional benefit
to forestall the development of resistance. In Cambodia,
parasite sensitivity to artemisinin may already be
decreasing [13]. In response to this alarming pattern,
WHO has formulated a Global Plan for Artemisinin
Resistance Containment (GPARC) to address the
need for specific and immediate actions to limit spread
[14]. Several candidate genes have been proposed to be
important in the development of artemisinin resistance
[15], but this remains a key ongoing area of research.

Complexities of treatment: stages and species
Species
Five species of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium spp.,
infect humans, with P.
falciparum causing the most
mortality worldwide and P. vivax causing significant
morbidity. P. vivax, a major contributor to malaria-related
morbidity, is more common in areas of lower transmis-
sion intensity, and therefore relapses originating from
P. vivax dormant form hypnozoites in the liver may
be an important contributor to disease incidence [16].
P. ovale and Plasmodium malariae are agents of the so-
called “benign malarias,” and like P.vivax, P. ovale can
cause relapsing infections. P. malariae can persist as a
blood stage parasite at very low levels and flare up
decades after initial infection. Morphologically, P. malar-
iae has been confused on bloodsmear with the recently
identified zoonosis, Plasmodium knowlesi, which has a

shorter life-cycle of replication than any of the other
human malarias, and can cause rapidly progressive and
fatal disease if not treated promptly [17].

Stages
Currently available antimalarials mainly target
the
symptomatic asexual blood stages, in order to be useful
for treatment as earlier stages of infection are clinically
silent. In keeping with this, the growth inhibition assay
for asexual blood stage P. falciparum is the primary
screening tool used for candidate antimalarials [4, 18-
22]. Consequently, although drugs against the dormant
hypnozoites and transmissible gametocytes are needed
for elimination programs, such drugs are difficult to
identify and test, and the drugs used against asexual
stages are generally ineffective for these other stages [5].
The only currently available drug which can kill the
dormant
form hypnozoite and the gametocyte is
primaquine, but primaquine cannot be used in patients
with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defi-
ciency or in pregnant women.

Another problem is that lack of standardized assays
which could be used to test drugs against dormant form
hypnozoites [23] limits drug development
for this
indication. Rodent models allow screening of blood
stage drugs, but rodent parasites do not form hypno-
zoites [24]. The relapsing Plasmodium cynomolgi model in
non-human primates was used in the development of
primaquine, but primate models are expensive,
low
throughput, and not available in many malaria research
centers. In vitro models of liver stage infection also have
many limitations, including difficulty obtaining spor-
ozoites and low infection rates. Whether cultured hepa-
tocytes retain their in vivo architecture, metabolism, or
receptors is an additional concern [25]. On top of this,
dormant hypnozoite forms are difficult to distinguish
from the early liver exoerythrocytic forms. Despite these
obstacles, progress is being made in the development of
liver stage hypnozoite assays, albeit none of these appear
amenable to high throughput capability that would
support clinical drug development [26-28].

Identification of drugs with anti-gametocyte and
transmission-blocking effects would aid in eradication
efforts. Although artemisinin and its derivatives have
been shown to reduce carriage of gametocytes, they do
not prevent transmission of mature gametocytes already
present at the time of treatment [32-34]. Indeed, the only
drug officially recommended by WHO to eliminate
gametocytes is primaquine for P. falciparum [8], and
encouragingly primaquine has been recently shown to
reduce transmission when added to an artemisinin com-
bination therapy in an open-label, randomized trial [32].

F1000 Biology Reports 2011, 3:24

http://f1000.com/reports/b/3/24

There are specific assays to screen the effect of drugs on
sexual stage parasites and parasite transmission to
mosquitoes are available in select centers [29,31].

Overcoming resistance
Drug resistant parasites typically develop when drugs are
at subtherapeutic levels, and therefore the short half-life
of artemisinins may protect this class of drugs [19,35]. In
addition, pairing the artemisinin derivative with other
antimalarial drugs with dissimilar mechanisms of action
will delay the emergence of drug resistant parasites.
However, because outpatient therapy now relies on this
single class of antimalarials, the artemisinins, all of the
artemisinin combination therapies will become vulner-
able to failure once fully artemisinin-resistant parasites
develop and spread. It is not clear whether the synthetic
artemisinin analogues currently under early stage devel-
opment will still be useful if and when this happens.

Something new: new drug candidates
The good news on the antimalarial development front is
that scientific and technological advances will allow for
more rapid identification of effective therapy and new
targets.

The sequencing of various Plasmodium genomes [36, 37]
has accelerated target identification and expression analy-
sis. Orthologues (genes that evolved from a common
ancestral gene in different species that generally retain the
same function) for targets of interest can be easily identified
and small molecules against these targets tested in vivo
(animal models) or in vitro. High throughput screening
in vitro can identify active molecules that can be further
optimized for preclinical testing [38]. The molecular-based
search for targets is referred to as the “rational design
approach.” This approach has not yet delivered a product,
in part because the time from molecular target identifi-
cation to clinic testing is great. One problem with this
approach is that it favors identification of drugs with one
rather than multiple targets, making these more likely to
induce parasite resistance.

Others have advocated the “whole parasite screening”
approach: molecules are selected from available chemi-
cal data, and hits (molecules) are identified through high
throughput screening with whole parasites. Molecular
targets are then established by generating mutant
parasites that are resistant to the active or “hit” molecule.
If a particular antimalarial has many targets, it has a
lower chance of encountering resistant parasites. This
method recently resulted in the identification of a new
candidate antimalarial, the spiroindolone NITD609, by
Rottman et al. [39], which has been shown to be safe for
testing in humans [40].

Mass screening of chemical libraries has yielded a wealth
of potential antimalarial compounds, and many are
active at sub-micromolar concentrations with minimal
toxicity to human cell lines. Screening assays in 1536-
well formats exist for asexual blood stage P. falciparum,
and assays are under development for the dormant liver
hypnozoite and transmission stages. In a screen of 2816
registered or approved compounds, 32 compounds were
recently found to be active against 45 parasite lines
sourced from around the world with IC50 values ≤ 1 mM,
including 10 compounds not previously known to have
anti-malarial activity. Genome-wide association and
linkage analysis then identified compounds that had
similar or distinct mechanisms of action, which might
predict cross-resistance and therefore guide combination
therapy [41].

To manage such large quantities of data being generated
by different groups, a centralized database of high
throughput screening results to “facilitate assimilation,
integration, and mining of data” has been started by the
WHO,
the United Nations, and the World Bank-
sponsored Tropical Disease Research group. Also,
public-private partnerships and non-profit organiza-
tions, such as Medicines for Malaria Venture, Drugs for
Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), and African Net-
work for Drugs and Diagnostics Innovation (ANDI),
have been developed with the idea of maximizing
collaborations and developing new therapies [4].

The current pipeline
Medicines for Malaria Venture, a non-profit group that
supports scientists and companies to develop new
antimalarials, highlights a number of compounds
considered leads in optimization, as well as antimalarials
in the pipeline (preclinical through Phase IV develop-
ment) on their website, (http://www.mmv.org/research-
development?gclid=CJPY–7e96oCFWUTNAod80I-Pg).
Many of these compounds are newly identified or novel
in their application to antimalarial therapy.

The initial approach to tackling drug resistance was to
develop drugs based on structures of existing antimalar-
ials, and this has been a profitable endeavor. Antimalarials
developed based on chloroquine include lumefantrine,
piperaquine and pyronaridine developed in China, each
of which are now components of artemisinin combina-
tion therapys in use or in advanced trial stages. In the
United States, other chloroquine-like antimalarials
include amodiaquine (also used in artemisinin combina-
tion therapy), mefloquine, and halofantrine, although the
last of these is not widely used clinically today [4]. Drugs
with indirect or direct disruption of pyrimidine meta-
bolism (e.g. pyrimethamine, sulfonamides, atovaquone)

have inspired the development of new drugs targeting
another aspect of the pyrimidine pathway: dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase [42]. Some of the lead candidates based on
already successful antimalarials [40] are highlighted
below:

4-Aminoquinolone derivatives
Pyronaridine, a chloroquine relative, is being used in
combination with artesunate as a promising new
artemisinin-based combination therapy. Pyronaridine-
artesunate has been studied in Phase II and Phase III
clinical trials, and has been shown to be effective against
uncomplicated P. falciparum and blood stage P. vivax [43].
As increasingly chloroquine-resistant strains of P. vivax
emerge, and as the need to treat P. falciparum and P. vivax
co-infection expands in certain areas, such a regimen
is welcome. Pyronaridine-artesunate is available as
Pyramax® tablets and pediatric granule formulations,
and manufacture of this compound is being undertaken
by Shin Poong Pharmaceuticals [40].

8-Aminoquinolone derivatives
Tafenoquine is a lead candidate drug aimed at a radical
cure of P. vivax (i.e. elimination of dormant stage
hypnozoites), and is being studied in a Phase II/III
tafenoquine/chloroquine combination study this year
[40]. A fixed dose artemisinin combination therapy,
artesunate-amodiaquine (Coarsucam/ASAQ, Winthrop)
has been approved by WHO and developed by Sanofi-
Aventis and the DNDi, and is undergoing Phase IV field
assessment [40].

Artemisinin derivatives
The endoperoxide feature of artemisinins, which confers
antimalarial activity, is shared by ozonide OZ439, a
synthetic endoperoxide. OZ439 carries the hope of
providing a single dose oral cure in humans when used
in combination. OZ439 is a rapidly acting agent against
asexual stage parasites, and will likely be developed for
use in combination with a partner drug with a longer
half-life than its own. Studies are underway to identify
such a partner. This drug is currently undergoing Phase
IIa trials. [44]

Caveats
For all of these drugs, the caveats regarding antimalarial
resistance and ease of dosing and administration remain.
Pharmacokinetic trials in adults, once done, must be
followed by appropriate pharmacokinetic studies in
children, as it is well known that certain antimalarials
(such as piperaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine)
have differing pharmacokinetics in children compared
with adults, which will modify their efficacy [45]. Drug
efficacy is also influenced by the degree of pre-existing

antimalarial immunity, acquired as children get older
and are exposed to malaria over and over again [46].
Thus, drug efficacy must be evaluated in children and
must take into account these additional factors.

Something old: novel approaches with existing
antimalarials
Drug cycling
Re-introduction of drugs after a period of non-use has been
considered as a strategy to combat malaria. In Malawi,
which halted chloroquine use in 1993 due to resistance,
chloroquine was demonstrated to have 99% clinical
efficacy a decade later, presumably due to the re-expansion
of susceptible parasites [47, 48]. However, in time it is
likely that the re-introduction of drug pressure will likely
result in re-emergence of chloroquine-resistant parasites.
One way to delay this would be to pair the re-cycled drug
with another drug. Combinations of quinine derivatives
with antimicrobials have shown synergy, for example
chloroquine/azithromycin (which has the advantage that
it is safe for children and pregnant women). Clinical
studies are underway to assess this combination for use
as intermittent preventative treatment, (administration at
defined intervals regardless of whether the patient has
malaria parasites in the blood,
is recommended for
pregnant women and infants designed to provide prophy-
laxis against malaria [40, 49]).

Getting round resistance
Preventing resistance in the first place is the major focus of
antimalarial drug development today. Artemisinin combi-
nation therapies represent a change in antimalarial therapy
paradigms since most drugs had been given as a mono-
therapy in the past. Indeed the use of artesunate mono-
therapy might have contributed to the development of
artemisinin-resistant parasites recently reported in Western
Cambodia [13]. In the present and future, combination
therapy will enhance efficacy of individual antimalarials
and reduce the likelihood of developing resistance.

In addition, agents that reverse resistance to existing anti-
malarials might extend the useful lifetime of old drugs.
Many compounds, including various calcium channel
blockers and chlorpheniramine, and even primaquine,
as examples, have been shown to reverse chloroquine
resistance. However, this approach is not completely
straightforward. Drug metabolism, drug levels required to
achieve the therapeutic effect, and the lack of clinical
research in this area, all represent obstacles to translate this
approach into practice [50]. Interestingly, parasites that
develop high-grade resistance mutations to antifolates,
such as pyrimethamine, might actually be rendered more
sensitive to certain novel inhibitors of antifolate metabo-
lism, such as WR99210 [51].

Infection-treatment-vaccination
A novel area of malaria research involves examining the
unforeseen benefits of treatment in the development of
malaria-specific immunity.
In experimental human
infection models, complete protection against infection
has been induced when patients are repeatedly exposed
to infection while taking antimalarials [52]. This form of
immunity was found to endure for 2 years or more in
some individuals [53], making this an exciting potential
approach to malaria prevention. However, testing has
thus far been limited to challenge with homologous
parasites (the parasite used to vaccinate is the same as
that used to challenge volunteers), and therefore future
studies will need to examine the degree of immunity
induced against heterologous or naturally transmitted
parasites.

Something borrowed: novel uses of other
anti-infectives
Drugs used in the management of HIV infection
HIV protease inhibitors have been shown to have direct
anti-parasite effects. Given the geographic overlap between
HIV and malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, and evidence that
malaria and HIV exert a co-pathogenic effect [2, 54-59],
any coincident effect of HIV medications on the malaria
parasite would have an obvious benefit. HIV protease
inhibitors directly interfere with Plasmodium growth
in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo [7, 60-64]. Clinical studies of
this effect are urgently needed, especially since WHO, with
few exceptions, does not recommend HIV protease
inhibitors for first line antiretroviral regimens.

In addition, HIV protease inhibitors may have
chloroquine-resistance reversing properties, according
to a patent filed in 2005 [50]. Saquinavir and ritonavir
behave synergistically with chloroquine and mefloquine,
against chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains of
P. falciparum [65]. Various HIV protease inhibitors have
also been shown to act synergistically against Plasmodium
chabaudi in vivo. [66,67] Synergy might result from HIV
protease inhibitors reducing levels of specific enzymes
and products (GSH and glutathione) used by the parasite
to detoxify by-products of hemoglobin digestion [68].

Conclusions
The parasite’s ability to evolve and adapt to every drug
introduced thus far mandates research to identify new
targets for antimalarial therapy. New technologies and
high throughput approaches are identifying a burgeon-
ing number of drug candidates and novel drug classes
with antimalarial activity, however the sobering reality is
that only a limited number of antimalarial drugs have
emerged from the development pipeline to enter clinical
practice over the past century. The Medicines for Malaria

the call

Venture estimates 10-15 years between drug screening
and ultimate registration, and thus many of the pre-
clinical antimalarial candidates discussed in this article
will not be seen in the clinic in the immediate future.
In addition,
for malaria elimination and
eradication is spurring the development of anti-malarials
that target the parasite in life cycle stages that were largely
ignored by drug developers in the past. In parallel with
the effort to develop vaccines that interrupt malaria
transmission, the drugs needed to contribute to elimi-
nation or eradication will target the parasite during tran-
smission to the mosquito or during its pre-erythrocytic
development in the liver, in order to terminate the
parasite’s spread. All this is a tall order for a drug pipeline
that has been historically slow, and hence the need to
consider all potential avenues—new, old, or borrowed—
to revive the malaria armamentarium.
