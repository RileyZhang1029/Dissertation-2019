The radial spoke (RS) is a complex of at least 23 proteins that
works as a mechanochemical transducer between the central-
pair apparatus and the peripheral microtubule doublets in
eukaryotic flagella and motile cilia. The RS contributes to the
regulation of the activity of dynein motors, and thus to
flagellar motility. Despite numerous biochemical, physiological
and structural studies, the mechanism of the function of the
radial spoke remains unclear. Detailed knowledge of the 3D
structure of the RS protein complex is needed in order to
understand how RS regulates dynein activity. Here we review
the most important findings on the structure of the RS,
including results of our recent cryo-electron tomographic
analysis of the RS protein complex.

Introduction

Eukaryotic flagella and motile cilia share a common “9 + 2”
structure, in which nine peripheral microtubule doublets (MTDs)
surround the central-pair of microtubules (CP) (Fig. 1A). The
MTDs and CP are connected by radial spokes (RSs). Genetic,
biochemical, and structural analysis indicate that the mechano-
chemical interaction between RSs and CP regulates the activity
of dynein motors attached to the MTDs and thus controls the
bending motion of the flagellum.

doublet, and (2) an orthogonal head, which is thought to have
transient contacts with the inner sheath and the CP.3-5 The RS
head was first recognized and described by Warner in the blowfly
sperm flagella Sarcophaga bullata and in Chlamydomonas flagella.6
The same T-shaped structure was later observed in the flagella and
cilia of many different species, ranging from protozoa to mammals.7-9

Placement of the RSs in the Axoneme

Groups of RSs repeat every 96 nm along the A-microtubule of
each MTD. In most organisms these groups contain a triplet of
spokes, RS1, RS2, and RS3 (Tetrahymena,2,5,7 Paramecium
tetraurelia,8 Trypanosoma brucey9 and sperm cells of sea urchin
species10,11). However,
in some other organisms these groups
contain only pairs of spokes, RS1 and RS2 (Chlamydomonas3,5,12
and S. bullata6). Proceeding from the proximal to the distal
axonemal end, RS1 is the first spoke in each triplet and RS2 is
about 32 nm distal to RS1. RS2 and RS3 are 24 nm apart, and
the distance between RS2 and RS1 of the next triplet is the
remaining 64 nm.2,5 We have shown that the RS3 structure in
Tetrahymena is distinct from RS1 and RS2.2

Strikingly, we have also revealed that the 96 nm repeat in
Chlamydomonas contains a fraction of RS3 within the doublet
repeat (Figs. 2A and 3A).2 However, the functional difference
between triplet and doublet repeats remains to be elucidated.

Morphology

Characterization of the Radial Spoke Proteins (RSPs)

Basic shape and anchoring of the radial spoke. Björn Afzelius,
in 1959, was the first to describe the presence of RSs in the
axonemes of sea urchin sperm flagella.1 He drew the RSs as
slender threads radiating between the CP and the 9 MTDs and
revealed that the RS binds only to the A-microtubule of the
MTD.1 In a recent cryo-electron tomography study of the detailed
3D structure of the RSs in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagella and
Tetrahymena thermophila cilia we have shown that the RS binds
onto the protofilaments A12 and A13 of the A-microtubule2
(Fig. 1C).

An RS is a T-shaped structure, composed of (1) an elongated
stalk that is anchored on the A-microtubule of a peripheral

Initially, SDS-PAGE analysis of the WT axonemes and axonemes
of paralyzed mutants of Chlamydomonas revealed 17 polypeptide
chains that were ascribed to the RS complex.13,14 Following that, a
procedure for purification of the RS complex from axonemes15,16
enabled identification of a total number of 23 proteins.16,17 These
proteins are called RSP1 to RSP23. The RSPs 2–4, 6, 16, 20, 22
and 23 have been identified and sequenced.18-24 In addition to the
23 RPSs, another complex, known as calmodulin and spoke-
associated complex (CSC), binds to the MTD and is essential for
anchoring the RSs (Table 1).25,26

To date there has been little structural or functional infor-
mation to elucidate the mechanism of function of RSPs. Never-
theless, sequence analysis of RSPs suggests the roles of individual
components of the complex. For example, several
functional
domains were found within the sequences of the RSPs 2 and 23
that suggest a role of signal transduction via cyclic nucleotides.

These two RSPs contain a cyclic GMP-binding domain, an
adenylyl cyclase domain and a nucleotide diphosphate kinase
domain. The RSPs 2 and 23 also contain an FHA domain, which

mediates
Indeed, the sliding velocity of axonemes has been shown to be
dependent on the activity of phosphate kinases, such as PKA
and CK1.27,28 Thus, phosphorylation likely plays an essential role
in the RS function. Furthermore, RSPs 2 and 23 contain
calmodulin-binding motifs.17 Additionally, sequences of RSPs 7
and 20 reveal a role of these RSPs in calcium signal transduc-
tion.17 Their sequences contain multiple EF-hand motifs, which
are structural domains present
in calcium-binding proteins.
RSP20 belongs to the calmodulin family.16 Consequently, RSPs

2 and 23 are likely to interact with the RSP20. However,
detailed structural information of the RS complex, along with
functional studies of the individual components, will be needed to
understand how RSs regulate axonemal dyneins.

Function of Radial Spokes

The role of RSs in the beating motion seems to be a signal
transduction between the CP and the dyneins.29 RSs are essential
for
flagellar motility under physiological ATP concentration
(0.2–1 mM ATP). Accordingly, Chlamydomonas mutants that
lack RSs show no flagellar beating.30-32 Nevertheless, flagellar
beating can be restored by low ATP concentrations (, 0.1 mM

possible mechanisms of signal transduction by RSs from the CP to

ATP) in these mutants.30,33 This shows that flagellar motility is
not abolished by the absence of RSs. Rather, RSs act as a motility
regulator. Thus, the interaction between CP and dynein motors,
mediated by RSs, seems to be critical for motility. However, in the
low concentration of ATP, dynein activity is independent of the
regulation by RSs. The mechanism of this regulation remains to
be elucidated.

The waveform of Chlamydomonas and sea urchin sperm
flagella is dependent on the concentration of calcium ions.34,35 As
mentioned in the previous chapter, RS proteins contain sequences
of domains involved in calcium binding and signaling (Table 1).17
Thus, RS are likely to be involved in the control of flagellum
waveform. However, Chlamydomonas mutants that lack RSs also
show the calcium-dependent waveform inversion.33 This suggests
a distinct or additional mechanism of calcium regulation to the
one mediated by RSs. For example, the outer dynein arms contain
calcium-binding proteins and thus can be involved in waveform
regulation.36

In the following chapters, we discuss the interactions between
the RSs with central-pair and microtubule doublets, as well as the

Interaction between RS Head and Central-Pair

It is known that the RS head extends toward the CP, but the
interaction between them has not yet been studied. It is not
known whether all the RSs interact contemporaneously with the
asymmetric structure of the CP complex, or if the interaction
itself is asymmetric (although all nine RS-heads face the CP) and
only some sets of RSs connect with the CP complex depending
on the bending motion phase. The sequences of the RS head
proteins (RSPs 1, 4, 6, 9 and 10) do not show any motifs of
secondary messenger signal transduction.17 RSP1 and RSP10 are
predicted to contain a series of MORN (membrane occupation
and recognition nexus) domains.17 The presence of MORN
sequences is puzzling. However, this seems to suggest that the
interaction between CP and RS heads is likely different from the
one in the stalk.

Interaction between RS Head and Stalk

The activity of individual axonemal dyneins must be coordinated
in response to the bending of flagella in order to maintain a
regular motion (theoretically37-39 and experimentally40). RSs are
likely to participate in the differential dynein regulation during
the bending of axoneme. In a hypothetical model, the RS base is
strongly attached to the MT while the rest of the structure shifts
upon bending, resulting in the tilt of RSs. As discussed in the
previous paragraph, the tilt could result in the detachment of RSs
from the CP followed by reattachment during the bending of the
flagellum. Indeed, tilt of RSs was observed by electron micro-
scopy and it was proposed to be the regulation mechanism of
bending.3,41 This hypothesis, however, remains to be investigated.

Interaction between RSs and Dyneins

RSs interact extensively with the inner arm dyneins (IDAs) (see
Fig. 1B for IDAs isoforms identification).2 As mentioned in
the beginning of this chapter, mutants lacking RSs are paralyzed
under physiological concentration, but the motility is restored in
low concentration of ATP.30 A possible explanation to this pheno-
menon would be intramolecular regulation of dynein activity,
proposed by Inoue and Shingyoji.42 In such a model, the motor
activity of certain dyneins would be inhibited by physiological
concentration of ATP. RSs would suppress
inhibition,
promoting the dynein activity even at physiological concentration
of ATP. Thus, in mutants lacking RS, the flagellar motility would
be impaired at high ATP concentrations due to the inhibition of
dynein, but would be restored at low ATP concentrations. This
hypothesis is strongly corroborated by the finding that in Chlamy-
domonas double mutants, lacking CP or RSs, as well as inner
dynein arm components, the flagellar motility is recovered.43,44
Thus, suppression of ATP-inhibition of inner arm dyneins by RSs
is a possible mechanism of regulation of flagellar motility.

All three radial spokes within one repeat have been shown by
freeze-fracture deep-etch electron microscopy to have the same
T-shaped structure.5 However, detailed analysis of Chlamydo-
monas and Tetrahymena RSs by cryo-electron tomography
proved that the three RSs are structurally not identical.2 Our
3D reconstructions show that RS3 has a unique morphology, but
that significant differences are also present between RS1 and RS2.

Localization of RS Proteins and Structural Differences

between RS1 and RS2

Our 3D reconstructions of Chlamydomonas and Tetrahymena
RSs show that RS1 and RS2 share the same overall architecture
(Figs. 2 and 3). Their structure can be divided into 4 domains:

(1) a very short base that is anchored to the MT, (2) an elongated
stalk, (3) a bifurcated neck, and (4) an orthogonal head (Fig. 2).2
In Chlamydomonas, RS1 and RS2 were subdivided in domains
not only on purely morphological grounds, but also based on the
protein composition of those four domains (Fig. 4). We were able
to locate groups of RS proteins by comparing the RS structure in
Chlamydomonas mutants lacking specific subsets of RSPs and
specific isoforms of the inner dynein arms (see Table 2 for details
about mutants).2 The mutant ida4 lacks dyneins a, c and d, and
retain the complete RS complex. The mutant pf14 is deficient in
RSP3 and biochemical data show that all the 23 RSPs are missing
in pf14 flagella.13 The comparative analysis of axonemes of WT,
pf14, and ida4 mutants showed that the RS base might contain
adaptor complexes (Fig. 4) such as the calmodulin spoke com-
plex (CSC).25 The CSC, which was shown to be present in pf14
axonemes,25 is important for anchoring the RS stalk to the MT,

pathway. Indeed, the 3D reconstructions show that the base of
RS1 and the base of RS2 are connected to the tails of the inner
dynein arm a/d and the inner dynein arm c, respectively
(Figs. 1B and 2B).

Although similar, the morphology of RS1 and RS2 base
differs in some detailed aspects. This is in agreement with the
effects of inhibiting the expression of specific CSC proteins,
which affects only the assembly of RS2. The CSC might
therefore be associated with RS2, but not with RS1.26 The
protein composition of the RS1 base is still unknown.

The RS stalk is the part of the spoke that carries the most
evident morphological differences between RS1 and RS2.
Two additional densities are visible at the base of the RS2
stalk (Figs. 2A and 3A amd B). One of these occurs at the
microtubule-anchoring area and connects the RS2 to the
nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) (Figs. 2A and 3A
and B), which is a component of the dynein activity regula-
tory system.43 The additional density at the base of the RS2
stalk disappears in the mutant pf14, thereby confirming that
it is a component of RS, but that it must not be confused with
the CSC.2

The mutant pf24 is deficient in RSP2, and lacks RSP1–2,
RSP4, RSP6, RSP9–10, RSP16 and RSP23. The differential
analysis of the 3D structure of WT, pf24, and pf14 mutant
flagella showed that the RS stalk is composed of RSP3, RSP5,
RSP7-8, RSP11-15, and RSP17-22 (Fig. 4).2 With the excep-
tion of RSP3, which is a component of both RS1 and RS2, it is
not yet known (1) which of the other RSP stalk proteins are
contained in the additional RS2 densities, and (2) which of
them are shared between RS1 and RS2. The morphological and
structurally inferred biochemical heterogeneity between RS1
and RS2 was also studied in Tetrahymena2 (Fig. 3A), and the
sea urchin.45 The morphology of the stalks is very similar in all
those species.

3D reconstructions of Chlamydomonas and Tetrahymena
RSs showed that the neck is a bifurcated area that connects
the spoke stalk to the head (Figs. 2B–D2 and 4B).2 In the
mutant pf1 the RSP1, RSP4, RSP6 and RSP9–10 are missing.
The morphological analysis of Chlamydomonas WT, pf24 and
pf1 flagella revealed that the radial spoke neck is composed of
multiple copies (presumably two) of RSP2, RSP16 and RSP23
(Fig. 4).2 The head of the spoke contains more than two copies
of RSP1, RSP4, RSP6, RSP9 and RSP10.2 In contrast to the
stalk, the head and the neck of RS1 and RS2 appear identical.
Another important finding is that the heads of RS1 and RS2
are symmetrical structures that consist of two identical sub-
domains (Figs. 2C and 3C). In Chlamydomonas, each of them
is 26 nm long and 9 nm wide, and in the head of the spoke
exhibits a 2-fold rotational symmetry (Fig. 2C). Although the
two head sub-domains are tightly interconnected, each one of
them is independently attached to one of the branches of the
bifurcated neck (Fig. 2B and C). Interestingly, RS1 and RS2

heads are also interconnected with a 2-fold translational symmetry.
These findings, which were also found in Tetrahymena (Fig. 3C),
allow a proposal of new theories about the interaction of RS with the
CP and the RS assembly process at the flagellar tip.

RS Pairs and Triplets, and Peculiarities of RS3

spokes

As mentioned before, the 3D analysis of RSs in Tetrahymena
and Chlamydomonas revealed significant structural differences
between the three radial
in a triplet. The RS3 in
Tetrahymena can still be seen as a T-shaped structure at low
resolution.5 In our cryo-tomographic studies it is easy to see that
the morphology and orientation of head, neck, and stalk are very
different compared with RS1 and RS2 (Fig. 3B and C). Rather
than extending perpendicularly from the MTD, as both RS1 and
RS2 do, the RS3 is slanted toward RS2 and the B-microtubule.
A similar orientation of RS3 is also seen in the sperm flagellum
of Gallus domesticus.46 As RS1 and RS2, RS3 also binds to
protofilaments A12 and A13, but its bifurcated base appears,
with respect to the orientation of the RS1 and RS2 stalk bases,
to be rotated by roughly 45°. The slanted base of RS3 is clearly
visible (Fig. 3A and B). Further evident structural differences are
that the RS3 neck is not bifurcated and the head doesn’t show

any evidence of a symmetrical arrangement. The morphological
peculiarities of RS3 suggest a substantially different protein com-
position compared with RS1 and RS2. It is therefore likely that
the role of RS3 in regulating the flagellum bending motion is
different than the roles of RS1 and RS2.

Maybe the most surprising discovery of our cryo-tomographic
analysis of Chlamydomonas RSs was a short structure located at
precisely the same place where RS3 is located in Tetrahymena
(Figs. 2A, 3A and 5). The positioning and the morphological
similarity between this short structure in Chlamydomonas and the
reconstructed base of RS3 in Tetrahymena indicate that the
Chlamydomonas repeat contains, in addition to the doublet of
RS1 and RS2, a portion of the RS3.2 This finding was further
confirmed by a comparison of the structure of Chlamydomonas
with the structure of RS3 in sea urchin sperm flagella.45 We
introduced the name RS3 stump (RS3S) for the portion of RS3
that is present in Chlamydomonas.

RS3S is connected to dynein d/a (Fig. 5A). The comparative
analysis in wild type (WT) and ida4 mutant flagella shows that
the arc-like structure that is connected to RS3 is a portion of the
dynein d/a tail and not a portion of the RS3 structure.2 In
Tetrahymena the RS3 stalk is connected also to dynein g/b.2

Further, we compared the 3D structure of RSs in Chlamydo-
monas mutants pf1, pf24 and pf14.2 These mutants lack specific
RS proteins and can therefore be used to visualize the structural
changes associated with these missing proteins. Although the
structures of RS1 and RS2 in these mutants lack big portions of
head and stalk, the RS3 stump maintained its wild-type mor-
phology in all mutants (Fig. 5B). RS3S remains unaltered even in
pf14, which lacks the RS1 and RS2 structures almost entirely.

different protein composition between RS3S

WT is the evidence that the RS3 has a very different protein
composition.2

The identity of the RS3 proteins, though, remains largely
unknown. Extraction of spokes from Tetrahymena cilia by KI,
purification, and molecular characterization of the RS proteins
followed by a comparative analysis with the RS proteomics in
Chlamydomonas might be a first step toward understanding of
the composition of RS3 and its functional role.

Assembly of the Radial Spokes:

the Dimerization Hypothesis

In Chlamydomonas the head of the radial spoke is a symmetrical
structure (Fig. 2C), with two identical, elongated domains
positioned in a 2-fold rotational symmetry.2 This is consistent
with the “hypothesis of dimerization” of the 12S intermediate
complex during 20S RS assembly.47 The 12S RSs are “7”- or
“L”-shaped structures, made of a long rod (~28 nm) and a head
(the projection) (~20 nm).47 Their size and shape suggest that
two of these L-shaped 12S intermediates combine in a 2-fold
symmetrical way to form one RS. In the cryo-electron tomo-
graphy structure, each of the two identical head domains binds
to one of the two branches of the bifurcated neck (Fig. 2B). The
RS stalk doesn’t appear symmetrical, although its base has a
bifurcated structure that anchors on adjacent protofilaments
(Fig. 1C). The stalk might contain a big coil-coiled-like structure
and additional proteins might attach subsequently to an initial
dimerization process,
thereby masking its initially symmetric
shape. RSPs 13-20 are not part of the 12S complex and their
contribution to the final RS 20S axonemal complex is not yet
resolved. They might create the asymmetry in the stalk structures
of RS1 and RS2.

Each symmetrical domain of the head could contain two
copies of the RSPs 1, 4, 6, 9 and 10, which have been identified
to form the head. Whether these proteins form dimers remains
to be elucidated, as well as the possibility of heterodimeric
formation. Only RSP10, however, has been shown to form
dimers in vitro.48 Kohno et al. also showed that RSP4 and RSP6
interact with RSP9 and RSP10, but not with each other.48 RSP1
was shown to interact with RSP4, but not with the other RS
head proteins.49 Although the protein interactions within the

head of RS have started to emerge, high-resolution structural
studies and in vitro reconstitution are needed to understand the
assembly, structure and function of the head.

The symmetrical arrangement of the head is a conserved
feature. Thus, even though the shape of the head differs signi-
ficantly between Tetrahymena and Chlamydomonas spokes, the
symmetrical organization remains the same (Fig. 3).2 Homologs
of RSP4 and RSP6 were identified in Tetrahymena,49 and
sequence analysis shows that homologs of RSP1, RSP9, and
RSP10 are also present in Tetrahymena. The structural difference
between Chlamydomonas and Tetrahymena RS heads could be
explained by a different organization of the five head proteins or
by the presence of additional proteins.

Functional

implications of symmetrical RS heads are not
known. While MTs are known to be unidirectional, the RS head
is symmetrical. Whether the signal transduction between the CP
and the RS is performed by a specific protein-protein interaction
remains obscure. The signal could also be propagated in another
way, for example, by mechanical interaction.

The reconstruction of 3D models of RSs by cryo-electron tomo-
graphy has revealed features of the structure of the individual RSs
as never seen before. Important information about the organization
of RSPs was also revealed. The new findings support the hypothesis
of the RS assembly by dimerization of the 12S RS precursors.

Nevertheless, detailed structural and biochemical studies of
the interaction between RSs and the CP are still needed in order
to fully understand the role of RSs in dynein regulation. Investi-
gations of the atomic structure of RSPs complexes combined with
the analysis of conformational changes of the RS 3D structure
during regulation of flagellum motility will hopefully reveal more
about the structure and function of the radial spokes.
