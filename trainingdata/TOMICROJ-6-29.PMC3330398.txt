Abstract: The relationship between the causal agent of Huanglongbing (HLB), Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus(Las), and the 
naturally occurring endosymbiotic community of its insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri, was 
studied. Variation was observed in the titer of Las within an ACP population feeding on the same material. The cause of 
this disparity is unknown, and has implications for Las  transmission and the spread of HLB. This  study utilizes culture 
independent  methods  to  establish  the  relationship  between  the  ACP’s  microbial  community  and  Las  acquisition.  DNA 
from 21 psyllids was amplified using universal 16S rRNA primers with Illumina adaptor regions and a sample-specific 7-
base  identifier.  These  amplicons  were  then  batch-sequenced  on  the  Illumina  platform.  The  resulting  sequences  were 
separated by the  identifier,  and compared  to known sequences in  a 16S rRNA database. The microbial communities of 
each psyllid were compared to determine whether a correlation exists between the ACP’s endosymbionts and level of Las 
acquisition.  

ACPs were dominated by the same four bacterialgenera regardless of the abundance of Ca.Liberibacter. A combination of 
qPCR  and  Illumina  sequencing  was  used  to  establish  an  infection  gradient  among  the  sampled  ACPs.  The  Ca. 
Liberibacter titer within the insect was found to have a strong negative relationship with an endosymbiont residing in the 
syncytium  of  the  mycetocyte  and  a  positive  relationship  with  Wolbachia.  These  correlations  have  implications  in  the 
acquisition of Las by the ACP as well as the activities of Las within this vector.

  Huanglongbing  (HLB),  or  citrus  greening,  is  killing 
mature 
to 
unmarketable levels [1, 2]. Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus (Las) is 
the likely cause of HLB in Asia and the Americas where it is 
vectored  by  a  Sternorrhynchian  insect,  the  Asian  citrus 
psyllid  (ACP)  Diaphorina  citri  [1,3,4].  Although  Koch's 
postulates  have  never  been  performed  with  this  uncultured 
bacterium,  the  correlation  between  disease  symptoms  and 
PCR-detection  of  the  bacterium  is  very  strong  [5,6]  and 
metagenomics has been used  to describe  the  etiology of the 
disease in citrus [7].  

 
Sternorrhyncha,  formerly  known  as  Homoptera,  are  a 
well-studied  suborder  of  Hemioptera  and  include:  plant 
hoppers, scale insects, aphids and psyllids. They are all sap-
feeders and have cultivated close relationships with bacteria 
that  synthesize essential nutrients absent  in their diet.  These 
primary  symbionts  are  often  housed

psyllid  is  a  bi-lobed  yellow  organ  located  between  the 
gonads and alimentary canal, and is present in all psyllid life 
stages [9, 10]. This organ is comprised of three somatic cell 
types: peripheral mycetocytes, central syncytia, and an outer 
membranous  cover.  Two  intracellular  symbionts  of  the 
bacteriocyte  have  been  described  for  many  psyllid  species. 
The mycetocyte cells are inhabited by an elongated, irregular 
bacteria  designated  X-inclusion  or  myc-endosymbiont. 
While  the  central  syncytium  space  harbors  a  separate 
bacteria  with  similar  morphology  known  as  Y-inclusion  or 
syn-endosymbiont  [9,  11].  Ca.  Carsonella,  Arsenophenous 
sp.,  Wolbachia,  and  Ca.  Liberibacter  sp.  have  also  been 
found  at  varying  rates  of  infection  in  psyllid  populations 
[10,12].  

such 

  Many  commensal  bacteria  of 
insects  are  obligate 
endosymbionts  and  thus  cannot  be  cultured  or  studied  
using  traditional  methods  [13,  14].  Some  symbionts  of 
Sternorrhyncha, 
as  Ca.  Carsonellarudii,  have 
degenerative  genomes  and  exist  on  the  border  between

and  its  microbial  community  has  led  to  a  more  complete

mechanisms  for  disease  vectors  and  the  microbes  they 
spread.  

  Las  infection  levels  in  the  ACP  are  highly  variable  and  
in  one  study  Las  acquisition  reached  only  40%  in  a  group  
of  psyllids  who  fed  from  HLB  positive  citrus  for  5  
weeks,  while  in  others  infection  rates  have  been  as  high  
as 88% [10, 18, 19]. However, relative  abundances of other 
endosymbionts  in  infected  psyllids  and  their  interactions 
with Las are not known. Recent evidence suggests that Las is 
the  only  bacterium  in  the  phloem  of  infected  citrus  plants 
[7]. This suggests  a very simple bacterial community  in the 
insect vector. Here high throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of 
individual  psyllids  is  used  to  determine  the  extent  to  which 
Las infection in the psyllid affects the microbial composition 
of the insect host.  

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Psyllid Capture and DNA Extraction  

  D.  citri  were  collected  from  symptomatic  citrus  trees. 
Adult  psyllids  were  kept  at  -20oC  prior  to  extraction.  The 
whole  DNA  of  each  psyllid  was  extracted  separately  using 
the QiagenDNeasy  Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, 
CA,  USA),  following 
instructions.  
DNA  concentration  and  purity  were  determined  by 
spectrophotometry. 

the  manufacturer’s 

Illumina  High  Throughput  Sequencing 
rRNAgenes 

of 

16S 

  Bacterial  16S  rRNA  genes  present  within  the  psyllid 
DNA were amplified using the primers 515F and 806R [20] 
with  the  addition  of  a  barcode  sequence  and  the  required 
Illumina  adapters  to  construct  an  amplicon  library  from  the 
V4 region of the 16S rRNA genes (Fig.  S1). The utilization 
of the Illumina polymerase-binding regions allow the samples 
to  be  sequenced  without  supplying  sequencing  primers  and 
eliminate  the  need  for  an  additional  ligation  step.  PCR  was 
performed at  an initial denaturation temperature of 94oC for 
3 min, followed by 20 cycles of 94oC for 45 sec, 50oC for 30 
sec, and 65oC for 90 sec. A final elongation step at 65oC was 
run  for  10  min.  PCR  products  were  purified  using  the 
Qiagen™ PCR purification kit following the manufacturer’s 
protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). 

 
Sequencing was done on an Illumina IIx (Illumina, Inc., 
CA,  USA)  with  two  paired  read  cycles  of  101  bases  each. 
Previously  described  sequence  analysis  methods  were 
modified  in  order  to  process  paired-end  Illumina  data  [21]. 
Sequences  were  first  trimmed  for  quality  using  a  modified 
version  of  Trim2  [22],  and  the  first  11  bases  of  the  primer 
region  of  each  paired  read  were  removed  to  eliminate  
the  degenerate  bases  on  each  primer.  Since  all  samples  
were  sequenced  in  a  single  multiplexed  Illumina  run,  
the  sequences  corresponding  to  each  sample  were  removed 
from  the  total  sequencing  output  based  on  the  barcode 
sequences using an in-house script (splitbybarcode.py 2011, 
https://gist.github.com/1006983).  The  prokaryotic  database 
used for 16S rRNA analysis was downloaded from RDP [23] 
and  formatted  using  TaxCollector  [24].  References  for 
isolates and sequences of all sizes were included.  

Sequences  were  compared  to  the  TaxCollector-modified 
 
RDP  database  using  CLC  Assembly  Cell  (version  3.11; 

Fagen et al. 

CLCbioKatrinebjerg,  Den.)  utilizing  the  paired  reads  and 
global  alignment  parameters.  Two  specific  parameters  were 
used in this step, a 98% length fraction and similarity values 
dependent  on  the  desired  taxonomic  level,  i.e.,  80%  at 
Domain/Phylum, 90% to Class/Order/Family, 95% to Genus 
(or corresponding OTU) and 99% of similarity to Species (or 
corresponding OTU) levels [25]. Pairs that matched different 
references  at  the  species  level  were  classified  at  the  lowest 
common  taxonomic level. Unresolved pairs were discarded. 
Henceforth,  successfully  paired  reads  are  referred  to  as 
‘reads’. 

Vindication of Illumina Methodology 

  The degree of Las  transmission  to each psyllid was also 
determined  using  quantitative  PCR  (qPCR)  to  confirm  the 
Illumina  results.  To  evaluate  the  occurrence  of  Las  in  the 
samples, the 16S rRNA gene for each replicate DNA sample 
was  amplified  using  the  species-specific  primers  HLBasp 
and  HLBr  [26].  qPCR  was  conducted  in  triplicate  in  a 
MX3000PqPCRThermalCycler  (Stratagene).  The  SYBR 
Green assay was carried out in a 25 (cid:1)L PCR mix containing 
20ng  of  DNA  template,  2X  QuantiTect®  SYBR®  Green 
Master Mix (Qiagen) and 10(cid:1)M of each primer. The average 
Ct  value  was  determined  for  each  psyllid  DNA  sample 
across  the  three  replicate  reactions,  and  compared  to  the 
Illumina results. Ct (Cycle threshold) value is the PCR cycle 
number  at  which  the  fluorescence  of  the  reported  dye  rises 
above  the  baseline  fluorescence  and  continues  to  increase 
exponentially.  The  Ct  value  of  a  sample  is  inversely 
proportional  to  the  amount  of  target  nucleic  acid  present. 
This  method  allowed  for  a  relative  determination  of  Las  in 
each sample. 

Population Analysis 

Spearman’s (rho), and Pearson’s (r, r2 ) coefficients were 
 
used to establish significant  correlations  in the data using  R 
statistical software (version 2.13; R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria[http://www.R-project.org/]). 

RESULTS 

Reads from Sequencing 

  An average total of 554,888 paired reads were generated 
for  each  sample  with  69.4%  surviving  rigorous  quality 
control tests. The average length per pair after trimming was 
159.3bp.  

Unclassified and Partially Classified Reads 

  A  percentage  of  reads  from  all  samples  could  not  be 
matched  to  a  reference  within  the  database.  In  addition, 
many  reference  sequences  were  not  classified  at  all 
taxonomic  levels.  These  reads  were  clustered  at  99% 
sequence  homology  and  a  length  fraction  of  0.98  and  a 
closest-named-match was determined and carried through to 
all taxonomic levels.  

qPCR and Illumina 

  Two  methods,  qPCR  and  16S 
rRNA  amplicon 
sequencing,  were  used  to  determine  the  portion  of  each 
sample  consisting  of  Liberibacter.  The  results  from  the  two 
methods were highly correlated (Fig. 1).

Ca. Liberibacter Acquisition 

  Ca. Liberibacter titer ranges from 16.15% to 0.0051% of 
total reads. In this analysis any sample with a Ca. Liberibacter 
presence  of  less  that  0.1%  is  considered  to  be  negative  and 
were  grouped  together.  Likely,  these  psyllids  did  not  feed 
from  infected  tissues  or  acquire  Las  at  levels  sufficient  to 

affect  a  change  in  the  established  microbial  community.  Of 
the  remaining  eight  psyllids,  3  have  Ca.  Liberibacter  levels 
greater than 4% while the others are all less than 1%. Due to 
this variation, the logarithmic transformation of the Illumina 
percent of total reads data was used to visualize correlations 
with Ca. Liberibacter infection (Figs. 1 and 3).

Fig. (1). Las populations determined using qPCR and Illumina methods were highly correlated (r2=0.923). Samples where Ca. Liberibacter 
constitutes less than 0.1% (log10<-1.5) of the population, based on Illumina findings, were designated as ‘Liberibacter negative’.

Fig.  (3).  Ca.  Liberibacter  titer  is  negatively  correlated  with 
syncytium  endosymbiont  which  resides  in  the  ACP  bacteriocyte 
and  exhibits  a  positive  relationship  with  bacteria  of  the  genus 
Wolbachia. Statistical analysis for both normally and non-normally 
distributed data show these relationships to be highly significant. 

Natural Endosymbiotic Associations 

  Las-negative  psyllids  from  the  sampled  population  were 
studied  to  establish  a  base-line  microbiome.  All  were 
dominated  by  four  genera  of  bacteria  (Fig.  2).  Universal

gammaproteobacteria  associated  with  the  periphery  of  the

associated  with 
the 
bacteriocyte (Accession No. AB038368; EF433792) (hereafter 
referred  to  as  syncytium  endosymbiont)  [10],  as  well  as  
Ca.  Carsonellarudii,  and  Wolbachia  sp.  All  other  genera 
constitute an  average of 16.1 percent of the population with 
no genus present at greater than 0.1 percent.

Change with Ca.Liberibacter infection 

  An  increase  in  Ca.  Liberibacter  reads  in  a  sample 
corresponds  to  a  decrease  in  the  percentage  of  total  reads 
classified as syncytium endosymbiont. However,  Wolbachia 
was  seen  to  increase  with  the  increase  in  Ca.  Liberibacter 
(Fig.  3).  Ca.  Carsonella  and  mycetocyte  endosymbiont 
showed  no  significant  variance  with  Ca.  Liberibacter  titer 
(data not shown).  

DISCUSSION 

  These  multiplexed  16S  rRNA  amplicon  sequencing 
methods allow for the simultaneous characterization of 1435 
microbial  communities  in  a  single  Illumina  sequencing  run, 
with  the  generation  of  12Mb  of  data  for  each  sample.  This 
sample number can also be increased through the utilization 
of additional barcodes.  The  ability to  expand the number of 

barcodes  is  an  improvement  over  proprietary  Illumina  and 
454  multiplexed  amplicon  sequencing.  This  method  greatly 
reduces the cost of sequencing each sample while increasing 
the  depth  of  community  characterization  over  qPCR  or 
culturing. 

  The  ACP's  microbiomes  were  analyzed  along 
the 
gradient  of  Ca.  Liberibacter  infection.  A  low  percentage  of 
the sampled psyllids (38%) acquired Las which is consistent 
with rates of infection that have been reported in captive and 
naturally-occurring  ACP  populations.  The  underlying  cause 
of  this  differential  Las  acquisition  rate  has  yet  to  be 
determined [18]. Here we  investigated the  link between Las 
acquisition and the ACP’s endosymbiotic community.  

  These  data  show  a  negative  correlation  between  
Ca.  Liberibacter  infection  with  the  percent  of  syncytium 
endosymbiontin  the  microbial  community.  However,  the 
variation  observed  within  the  negative  psyllids  showed  that 
natural  variation  in  syncytium  endosymbiont  titer  is  present 
even  in  the  absence  of  Las  infection,  although  not  to  the 
extent observed  in the samples with the highest percentages 
of  Ca.  Liberibacter.  It  is  not  known  whether  Las  displaces  
the  bacteria  in  the  bacteriocyte  or  whether  a  naturally  
lower  abundance  of  the  syncytium  endosymbiont  facilitates 
the  acquisition  of  large  numbers  of  Las  by  the  ACP. 
Interestingly, 
the  population  of  another  bacteriocyte-
associated bacteria, mycetocyte endosymbiont, was unaffected 
by Las acquisition.  

  Las  is  differentially  distributed  in  the  psyllid’s  tissues. 
Infection rates are lower in the alimentary canal and salivary 
glands  than  in the rest of  the body [27]. The variable affect 
of Las on  the  endosymbiotic bacteria may be  caused by the 
irregular  distribution  of  Las  within  the  host  causing  certain 
bacteria  to be displaced  and not others.  The highest relative 
titer of Las within the ACP has been detected in the salivary 
glands  and  the  alimentary  canal,  while  the  Las  detected  in 
the  rest  of  the  body  was  more  diffuse  [27].  However  the 
presence  of  Las  in  body  tissues  such  as  those  of  the 
bacteriocyte has not been investigated.  

also  observed.  Unlike 

  A strong positive correlation between Wolbachia and Ca. 
Liberibacter  was 
syncytium 
endosymbiont,  Wolbachia  is  not  localized  in  the  psyllid’s 
bacteriocyte, and has been detected primarily in reproductive 
tissues [28]. Wolbachia was ubiquitous in the psyllids tested, 
and  the  ‘negative’  samples  showed  great  variation  in  
the  percent  of  the  endosymbiotic  community  composed  
of  Wolbachia.  Wolbachia  has  been  shown  to  induce  host 
insect  gene  expression  that  creates  a  favorable  intracellular 
environment  for  Wolbachia  growth  [29].  A  comparable 
mechanism  may  lead  to  increased  Wolbachia  and  related 
increase in Las populations within the ACP.  

 
Finding an increase in Wolbachia titer with Las infection 
indicates  a  more  complicated  mechanism  than  simple 
replacement of indigenous endosymbionts by Las. A deeper 
understanding of the relationship of Las with Wolbachia and 
syncytium  endosymbiont  may  elucidate 
the  previously 
undescribed actions of Las within the psyllid.
