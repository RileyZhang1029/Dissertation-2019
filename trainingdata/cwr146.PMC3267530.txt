N-linked glycans are composed of three major types: high-
mannose (Man), hybrid or complex. The functional role of
hybrid- and complex-type N-glycans in Newcastle disease
virus (NDV) infection and fusion was examined in N-acet-
ylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT I)-deﬁcient Lec1 cells, a
mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell incapable of
synthesizing hybrid- and complex-type N-glycans. We used
recombinant NDV expressing green ﬂuorescence protein or
red ﬂuorescence protein to monitor NDV infection, syncy-
tium formation and viral yield. Flow cytometry showed
that CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells had essentially the same
degree of NDV infection. In contrast, Lec2 cells were found
to be resistant to NDV infection. Compared with CHO-K1
cells, Lec1 cells were shown to more sensitive to fusion
induced by NDV. Viral attachment was found to be compar-
able in both lines. We found that there were no signiﬁcant
differences in the yield of progeny virus produced by both
CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells. Quantitative analysis revealed that
NDV infection and fusion in Lec1 cells were also inhibited
by treatment with sialidase. Pretreatment of Lec1 cells with
Galanthus nivalis agglutinin speciﬁc for terminal α1-3-
linked Man prior to inoculation with NDV rendered Lec1
cells less sensitive to cell-to-cell fusion compared with mock-
treated Lec1 cells. Treatment of CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells
with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, signiﬁ-
cantly blocked fusion and infection. In conclusion, our
results suggest that hybrid- and complex-type N-glycans are
not required for NDV infection and fusion. We propose that
high-Man-type N-glycans could play an important role in
the cell-to-cell fusion induced by NDV.

Introduction

(NDVs)

are non-segmented,
Newcastle disease viruses
single-stranded RNA viruses
that belong to the genus
Avulavirus in the family Paramyxoviridae (Mayo 2002). As
with other viruses, sialic acid-containing glycans play a key
role in the initial steps of NDV infectious life cycle (Olofsson
and Bergstrom 2005; Isa et al. 2006; Villar and Barroso
2006). The entry of NDV into the host cell can be broken
down into two steps: attachment to the cellular receptors and
membrane fusion (Villar and Barroso 2006). Hemagglutinin–
neuraminidase (HN) protein binds to sialylated glycans on the
cell surface and fusion (F) protein is responsible for the
fusion between the viral envelope and the plasma membrane
(Lamb and Kolakofsky 2001). However, there are details of
the mechanism that remain to be fully clariﬁed. Recently,
Ferreira et al. (2004) reported that gangliosides and N-linked
glycoproteins serve as NDV receptors.

N-glycan is covalently attached to protein at asparagine
(Asn) residues by an N-glycosidic bond. In eukaryotes cells,
there is a wide diversity of N-glycan structures. Manα1-6
(Manα1-3)Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-Asn-X-Ser/Thr
is a common core sugar sequence of all N-glycans, which are
divided into three types: high-mannose (Man), in which only
Man residues are attached to the core; hybrid, which have two
branches from the core, one that terminates in Man and one
that terminates in a sugar of the complex type (Yamashita et al.
1978); and complex, such as tri- and tetraantennary glycopep-
tides containing outer chains of sialic acid, galactose (Gal),
N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues and an α-linked Man
residue substituted at positions C-2 and C-6 (Tabas and
Kornfeld 1978). The biosynthesis of a complex N-linked
glycan is a complex and high-ordered process, which is
initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and completed in
the Golgi apparatus.

further remodeled by a series of enzymes to yield complex-
type N-glycans. Incomplete processing of N-linked glycan
results in the production of high-Man glycans, which terminate
in Man (Tabas et al. 1978). Many inhibitors have been ident-

Lec1 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutants were isolated
for sensitivity to Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) which
speciﬁcally binds the terminal α1-3-Man of high-Man glycans
but not hybrid glycans (Shibuya et al. 1988; Hester and
Wright 1996) and resistance to the leucoagglutinin from
Phaseolus vulgaris (L-PHA; Stanley, Caillibot, et al. 1975;
Stanley, Narasimhan, et al. 1975), which binds to certain
branched, complex-type N-glycans containing the pentasac-
charide sequence Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2(Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-6)
Manα1-R. Lec1 cells have been characterized as having an
insertion or deletion within the Mannosyl-α1,3-glycoprotein-
β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (Mgat1) gene open
reading frame (ORF), resulting in an absence of GnT I
activity and do not synthesize complex and hybrid N-glycans
(Chen and Stanley 2003; North et al. 2010) and accumulation
of abundant Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycans (North et al. 2010). In
addition, an Lec2 cell line is also a mutant CHO cell line
defective in the Cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-sialic acid
transporter (SAT), which is responsible for the translocation
of CMP-sialic acid into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus
(Eckhardt et al. 1998). As such, the loss of CMP-SAT activity
results in signiﬁcantly reduced levels of sialylation of glyco-
proteins and gangliosides (North et al. 2010).

In this study, we have engineered a recombinant NDV carry-
ing a red ﬂuorescence protein (RFP) reporter inserted into the
region between the P/V and the M genes via reverse genetics.
We used this recombinant NDV expressing RFP, and another
recombinant NDV expressing green ﬂuorescence protein (GFP;
Liu et al. 2007), to study viral infection and fusion in host cells.
To elucidate the role of complex N-linked glycans in NDV
infection and fusion, we used Lec1 cells which are deﬁcient in
terminal N-linked glycosylation, with no effect on the synthesis
of O-glycan and glycolipid (Sarkar et al. 1991; Puthalakath
et al. 1996; North et al. 2010). Our results clearly indicate that
NDV undergoes efﬁcient infection and replication and enhanced
fusion in Lec1 cells, supporting that hybrid and complex
N-linked glycans are not functionally essential for infection and
cell-to-cell fusion induced by NDV. In addition, we propose that
high-Man N-linked glycans on the surface of Lec1 cells could
play an important role in the cell–cell fusion induced by NDV.

RFP transcription cassette containing the RFP ORF, ﬂanked by
NDV gene-start (GS) and gene-end (GE) sequence motifs, was
inserted into in the downstream non-coding region of the P/V
gene of the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) clone of
the NDV Laoxi (LX) strain (Figure 1A) following the rule of
six (Peeters et al. 2000). For virus recovery, the full-length
pLX-RFP plasmid was then cotransfected with the helper plas-
mids as described previously (Peeters et al. 2000). The resultant
recombinant virus, which was designated rLX-RFP, was readily
rescued and found to replicate efﬁciently in titers similar to
those of the wild-type NDV LX strain [5 × 108 plaque forming
unit (PFU)/mL] in 9-day-old embryonated eggs (Figure 1C).
To determine whether RFP was expressed in infected cells,
CHO-K1 cells were infected with the rLX-RFP at a multiplicity

microscope (TCS SP2). CHO-K1 (red line) and Lec1 cells (black line) were incubated with FITC-labeled L-PHA for 45 min at 4°C and analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry. Cells analyzed in the absence of FITC-labeled L-PHA are shown in the ﬁlled light-gray trace (C). CHO-K1 (E) and Lec1 (D) cells were ﬁxed in 2%

incubated with AP-conjugated anti-DIG for 45 min at 37°C and then treated with NBT/BCIP for visualization under Leical ﬂuorescence microscope. CHO-K1

RFP expression was observed in cells (Figure 1B). The results
showed that rLX-RFP could efﬁciently infect and express RFP
in CHO-K1 cells.

Lec1 cells are deﬁcient in terminal N-linked glycosylation
Lec1 cells, a mutant CHO cell line, are incapable of synthe-
sizing hybrid and complex N-glycans due to a defect the GnT
I gene. Therefore, we used the lectin L-PHA, which binds to
branched, complex glycan structures, such as tri- and tetraan-
tennary glycopeptides containing outer Gal residues and an
α-linked Man residue substituted at positions C-2 and C-6, to
detect
terminal N-glycans on CHO-K1 cells and on Lec1
cells. Confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy and ﬂow cytometry
showed that CHO-K1 cells bound high levels of L-PHA,
whereas Lec1 cells did not bind L-PHA (Figure 2A–C).
Additionally, the lectin GNA was used to identify the terminal
α1-3-linked Man residues (Shibuya et al. 1988). In the immu-
nohistochemical staining assay and ﬂow cytometry, we found
that Lec1 cells showed a strong reaction with GNA. In con-
trast, CHO-K1 cells failed to bind GNA (Figure 2D–F).
These data conﬁrmed that we had authentic Lec1 cells.

Lec1 cells express equivalent levels of cell-surface sialic
acids to CHO-K1 cells
To evaluate the levels of α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialic acids on
the surface, We used Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA;

(SNA; speciﬁc for the α2-6 linkage) to carry out a lectin-
binding assay. In ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting analysis
(FACS), we found that Lec1 cells have overall α2-3 sialic acid
levels equal to those of CHO-K1 cells (as shown in Figure 3).
In contrast, both cells failed to SNA speciﬁc for α2,6-linked
sialic acid (data not shown).

(6B1) for 45 min at 4°C, and then incubated with the FITC-labeled antibody for 45 min at 4°C. Virus binding was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Cells analyzed in

at an MOI of 1 for 16 h (viral replication was revealed by GFP or RFP). At 16 hpi, infected cells were visualized for GFP (shown in B) or RFP (shown in A)
expression under the inverted ﬂuorescence microscope. At 16 hpi, CHO-K1 (black line), Lec1 (red line) and Lec2 (blue line) cells were also subjected to ﬂow
cytometric analysis for quantitating NDV infection (rLX-RFP), as shown in C. Mock-infected CHO-K1 cells were shown in the ﬁlled light gray trace.

NDV binds efﬁciently to Lec1 cells
To investigate the effect of the absence of hybrid or complex
N-linked glycans on attachment of NDV to the cells, we per-
formed virus-binding assays using Lec1 and CHO-K1 cells.
Cells were exposed to rZJ1 at an MOI of 50 or 10 on ice, to
allow virus binding, but not internalization. Virus binding was
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry after 90-min incubation on ice.
Both Lec1 and CHO-K1 cells (Figure 4A and B) showed
comparable high levels of virus binding, suggesting that the
attachment of NDV is essentially not affected in Lec1 cells.

Lec1 cells are markedly infectable with NDV
To determine whether hybrid or complex N-linked glycans
were dispensable for NDV infection, we tested the infection
with rZJ1-GFP and rLX-RFP. Particularly,
rZJ1-GFP was
chosen as a good model, because ZJ-1/00(Go) was a member
of genotype VIId NDV, which is the predominant genotype
circulating worldwide and contains only virulent viruses. In
these experiments, Lec1 cells were readily and efﬁciently
infected with two NDV strains used, which was similar to
CHO-K1 cells.

To compare the susceptibility of different cell lines to NDV
infection quantitatively, we performed the ﬂow cytometry

372

assay calculating the numbers of cells infected in each cell line
by the same virus dosage. In this assay, we chose avirulent
rLX-RFP, because it did not form syncytia without addition of
exogenous L-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone
(TPCK)-treated trypsin. The results revealed that Lec1 cells
were readily infected with NDV, albeit the susceptibility of
Lec1 cells to NDV infection was somewhat lower than that of
CHO-K1 cells (Figure 5). Furthermore, Lec2 cells were found
to become resistant to NDV infection (Figure 5). Therefore, we
conclude that the sensitivity of Lec1 cells to virus infection and
fusion appears to be a feature of NDV.

NDV infection leads to syncytia formation in Lec1 cells
to a markedly greater extent than in CHO-K1 cells
To overcome the addition of TPCK-treated trypsin to activate
the precursor F0, we chose fully velogenic rZJ1-GFP to
perform syncytium assays rather than lentogenic rLX-RFP.

Fig. 6. NDV-induced syncytium formation in CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells. (A) CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells were pretreated or non-treated with GNA for 1 h at 37°C
prior to viral infection, and then infected with NDV (rZJ1-GFP) at an MOI of 1. At 16 hpi, cells were ﬁxed with methanol for 10 min and stained with Giemsa.
Syncytia formation was shown in (I). The number of syncytia (cells containing more than three nuclei) was counted in 10 random areas of the well (data are
mean ± SD of three independent experiments), as shown in (II). (B) CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells were pretreated or non-treated with tunicamycin (TM) for 24 h at
37°C prior to viral infection, and then infected with NDV (rZJ1-GFP) at an MOI of 1. At 16 hpi, cells were ﬁxed with methanol for 10 min and stained with
Giemsa. The number of syncytia (cells containing more than three nuclei) was counted in 10 random areas of the well (data are mean ± SD of three independent
experiments), as shown in (III).

NDV was able to propagate in Lec1 cells and induced much
more syncytia formation, supporting that the lack of hybrid
and complex N-linked glycans does not reduce the sensitivity
of Lec1 cells to NDV-induced fusion.

Terminal α1-3-linked Man residues of high-Man N-glycans
are critical for cell-to-cell fusion induced by NDV
The sensitivity of Lec1 cells to NDV-induced fusion led to
consider
the possible effect of high-Man N-glycans on
enhanced cell-to-cell fusion. CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells were
incubated with GNA and then subjected to NDV infection at

an MOI of 1. The extent of cell–cell fusion was quantiﬁed by
syncytium assays at 24 hpi. As shown in Figure 6I and II, we
observed that GNA treatment caused a marked reduction in
cell–cell fusion in Lec1 cells, while the fusion was essentially
unaffected in CHO-K1 cells. The data suggested that
the
increase in high-Man N-glycans in Lec1 correlates closely
with enhanced cell–cell fusion induced by NDV.

the cell-to-cell fusion induced by NDV, we treated CHO-K1

tunicamycin were infected with NDV at an MOI of 1 and the
extent of syncytium formation between NDV-infected cells
was analyzed. The data were shown in Figure 6III. As can be

Pretreatment of Lec1 cells with sialidase blocks NDV
infection and fusion
In order to examine the importance of sialic acid for the
initiation of NDV infection, Lec1 cells were treated with NA
from Vibrio cholerae prior
to infection with rZJ1-GFP.
Infection was evaluated by observation of GFP under the ﬂu-
orescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 7, in cells infected
with rZJ1-GFP at an MOI of 1 following pre-treatment with
200 mU NA, we observed a distinct reduction in the number
of infected cells. These results revealed that neuraminidase
(NA) treatment rendered Lec1 cells resistant to infection by
the NDV-ZJ1 strain, similar to Lec2 cells. These ﬁndings
strongly suggested that NDV requires a greater amount of
sialic acids on the cell surface to initiate an infection.

Kinetics of rZJ1-GFP infection in different cells
To test whether the absence of hybrid or complex N-linked
glycans in Lec1 cells could reduce the yield of infectious virus
progeny, we carried out a multicycle growth in CHO-K1 and
Lec1 cells. The cells were infected with rZJ1-GFP at an MOI
of 0.01. At different time points post-infection, viral titers in
the supernatants were determined by GFP autoﬂuorescence,
highly correlated with the immunoﬂuorescence assay (IFA) titer
(Engel-Herbert et al. 2003). rZJ1-GFP displayed a growth
pattern in Lec1 cells similar to in CHO-K1 cells, as shown in
Figure 8. This result revealed that no signiﬁcant differences in
the yield of progeny virus were shown in both Lec1 and
CHO-K1 cells, suggesting that hybrid and complex N-linked
glycans are not essential for NDV infection and replication.

which lack GnT I activity, did not differ from the wild-type
CHO cells in its interactions with NDV (Polos and Gallaher
1979). Virus attachment and lectin-binding assay may account
for the observed sensitivity of NDV to Lec1 cells. In fact,
virus binding was quantitatively almost equivalent with both
Lec1 and CHO-K1 cells. This is correlated with the results
that the quantity of sialic acids on the surface of Lec1 cells
was comparable with that of CHO-K1 cells, which is consist-
ent with those of Chu and Whittaker (2004). In addition, we
also found that the yield of progeny virus from Lec1 cells
was comparable with that obtained from CHO-K1 cells.

Furthermore, we observed that Lec1 cells were more sensi-
tive to cell-to-cell fusion induced by NDV than that of the
wild-type CHO-K1 cells, albeit the sensitivity of Lec1 cells to
NDV infection was comparable with that of CHO-K1 cells.
Lec1 cells were infected by NDV mainly via substantial syn-
cytia formation in Lec1 cells (cell-to-cell fusion), whereas
NDV ﬁrst infected a single CHO-K1 cell and then syncytia
were formed in CHO-K1 cells. However, Polos and Gallaher
(1979) discovered that ricin-resistant CHO-15B cells were
resistant to cell fusion and lysis induced by NDV. The discre-
pancy may be attributed to the different NDV strains and
CHO cell mutants used in both works.

The observed enhancement of cell-to-cell fusion induced by
NDV was not due to virus binding. Because the results
described above showed that the binding of NDV to Lec1 cells
was quantitatively similar to that of CHO-K1 cells. In light of
these results, we propose that high-Man N-linked glycans could
play a critical role in the cell-to-cell fusion induced by NDV. To
support this hypothesis, it has been reported that the plant lectin
GNA speciﬁcally binds the terminal α1-3-linked Man of
high-Man-type N-linked glycans but not hybrid-type N-glycans
(Shibuya et al. 1988) and Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycans were the
predominant high-Man N-glycans in Lec1 cells (North et al.
2010). From our studies, the sensitivity of GNA-treated Lec1
cells to cell-to-cell fusion induced by NDV was less than that of
mock-treated Lec1 cells. On the other hand, the treatment with

A recent report proposed that there could be two different
phases in NDV binding: an early ganglioside-dependent phase,
and a later N-glycoprotein-dependent phase (Ferreira et al.
2004). In this multistep attachment model, the interaction of
HN protein with gangliosides would trigger a partial confor-
mational change in HN, rendering it suitable to interact with
second receptors: N-glycoproteins; subsequently,
the inter-
action of HN with N-glycoproteins would elicit another confor-
mational change in HN protein that would induce a
conformational change in F protein, resulting in complete
virus-cell fusion (Ferreira et al. 2004). As deduced from this
hypothesis,
the change of oligosaccharide sequences of
N-glycoproteins which might affect a membrane rearrangement
has an inﬂuence on the interaction of HN with N-glycoproteins

GNA), or by the absence of hybrid-and complex-type

Based on these results, we speculate that the mechanism of
enhanced sensitivity to NDV-induced fusion in Lec1 cells
may be attributed to the change of virus–cell interaction sub-
sequent to viral binding.

In conclusion, our results clearly show that hybrid- and
complex-type N-glycans are not essential for NDV infection

Complex glycans not essential for NDV infection and fusion

and cell-to-cell fusion. We also propose that high-Man-type N-
glycans could play a critical role in the cell-to-cell fusion
induced by NDV. These observations continue to add to our

Materials and methods
Cells
CHO-K1 (CCL-61; Puck et al. 1958) and Lec1 (CRL-1735;
Stanley, Caillibot, et al. 1975; Stanley, Narasimhan, et al.
1975) cells were purchased from cell
resource center of
Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences. Lec2 cells (CRL-1736; Stanley and
Siminovitch 1977; Deutscher et al. 1984) were a kind gift
from Dr P. Stanley (Albert Einstein College of Medicine).
CHO-K1, Lec1 and Lec2 cells were cultured in α-minimal
essential medium (αMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), and 1% of an antibiotic stock containing
penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and fun-
gizone (2.5 μg/mL). Primary chicken embryo ﬁbroblast (CEF)
cells were prepared from 9-day-old speciﬁc-pathogen-free
(SPF) chicken embryos and grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁcation
of Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS.

Viruses
A recombinant ZJ1-NDV strain expressing GFP, rZJ1-GFP,
was generated by Liu et al. (2007) using the reverse genetics
approach. LX strain, rZJ1-GFP and rZJ1 were propagated in
9-day-old SPF chicken embryos.

Construction and generation of a recombinant NDV
expressing RFP
To construct rLX-RFP (based on the NDV LX strain), a 678 bp
cDNA encoding the RFP ﬂanking NDV GE, intergenic (IG),
GS sequences (Figure 1A), was modiﬁed by fusion polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) with three pairs of primers (PU: 5′-GG
GCATGATGAAGATCCTGGACCCTGGTTGTG-3′; PD: 5′-G
GTGTTCTACCCGTGTTTTTTCTAAGAGGAGCTTGGTGC
AGATACCGTG-3′; RFPU: 5′-TTAGAAAAAACACGGGTAG

GC-3′; MU: 5′-CTGTAGCTGCAAACCCAAGGTCCAAC-3′;
5′-GCTCAACAAGATCTCCGACATTTGGTACACTC
MD:
C-3′). The resultant PCR product was digested with Age I and
Avr II and inserted into the Age I-to-Avr II window of a sub-
clone, nucleotides 2311–8157 in the antigenomic cDNA of
NDV strain LX. This subclone encompassed the downstream
sequence of the P gene, and the upstream sequence of the M
gene (Figure 1A). The RFP-coding sequence was inserted into
nucleotide position 3143 in the antigenomic cDNA because it
allowed ﬂanking a set of GE, IG and GS. This subclone was
digested with Sac II and Spe I, and then assembled into the
full-length antigenomic cDNA to result in the full-length clone
pLX-RFP. The total number of added nucleotides was 702,
thus maintaining a ﬁnal genome length that was an even
multiple of six, as required for efﬁcient RNA replication
(Kolakofsky et al. 2005). rLX-RFP was rescued by cotransfect-
ing BSR T7/5 cells with the antigenomic plasmid pLX-RFP, N,

Virus infection
CHO-K1, Lec1 or Lec2 cells, which were grown to con-
ﬂuency in 35 mm tissue culture dishes, were washed three
times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and inoculated
with rZJ1-GFP or rLX-RFP at an MOI of 1 in serum-free
αMEM. After absorption at 37°C for 1 h,
the cells were
washed and further incubated in αMEM supplemented with
1% FBS. Cells were constantly observed for the cytopathic
effect
(CPE) and RFP or GFP expression at 16 hpi.
Photomicrographs of RFP- or GFP-expressing cells were
acquired using a Leica DMI 3000B inverted ﬂuorescence
microscope. RFP ﬂuorescence expressed by rLX-RFP was
quantitatively measured by ﬂow cytometry.

Sialidase treatment assays
Lec1 cells were treated with NA type III from V. cholerae
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) to determine the role of
cell-surface sialylated glycans in NDV infection as described
previously (Shen et al. 2011). Brieﬂy, the monolayers of Lec1
cells in 35 mm tissue culture dishes were incubated with 200
mU/mL NA in serum-free αMEM at 37°C for 3 h. Cells were
then washed three times and subjected to NDV infection at an
MOI of 1. Infected cells were visualized for GFP or RFP
expression at 16 hpi. RFP ﬂuorescence expressed by rLX-RFP
was quantitatively measured by ﬂow cytometry.

Flow cytometry
For ﬂow cytometry preparation, cells were digested with typsin
from the dish, washed in PBS, ﬁxed in 2% paraformaldehyde.
To quantitate virus infection, infected cells were analyzed on
BD FACSAria cytometry as previously described (Chu and
Whittaker 2004). Lectin-binding assays used ﬂuorescein iso-
thiocyanate
(FITC)-labeled L-PHA (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA), and digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled MAA, SNA
and GNA (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). DIG-labeled
lectins were localized with FITC-conjugated anti-DIG antibody
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).

Lectin-binding assays
To examine hybrid- or complex-type N-glycans on the
CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells, cells were ﬁxed in 2% paraformalde-
hyde at room temperature for 20 min, blocked in Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) containing 10% goat serum and then incubated
with FITC-labeled lectin L-PHA (10 μg/mL). Cell nuclei were
couterstained with DAPI [2-(4-amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarba-
midine dihydrochloride; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO].
Fluorescent images were imaged with a Leica confocal ﬂuor-
escence microscope (Leica model TCS SP2), using × 63
objectives.

To determine the level of α1-3-linked Man on the cell
surface, we used DIG-labeled GNA (2 μg/mL) speciﬁc for
terminal α1-3-linked Man. Immunohistochemical staining was
performed using DIG Glycan Differentiation Kit
(Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).

376

To investigate the role of high-Man N-linked in the virus
infection and fusion, cells were pretreated with GNA (500 μg/
mL) for 1 h at 37°C prior to viral
infection and syncytia
assays.

Treatment of Lec1 cells with N-glycosylation inhibitor
N-glycosylation inhibitor assay was performed as described
previously (Wu et al. 2006). CHO-K1 and Lec1 in 12-well
plates were grown to conﬂuence and incubated in the presence
of 0.5 μg/mL tunicamycin for 24 h at 37°C. After the treat-
ment with tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), the
cells were washed twice with fresh serum-free αMEM and
then infected with NDV at an MOI of 1. After 1 h infection,
the medium was removed and the cells were washed and incu-
bated for 16 h before a syncytia assay.

Virus-binding assays
CHO-K1, Lec1 and Lec2 cells were exposed to rZJ1 at an
MOI of 50 or 10 on ice to allow virus binding. After 90 min
incubation on ice, cells were incubated with the monoclonal
antibody to NDV HN protein (6B1) (Hu et al. 2010) for 45
min at 4°C and then incubated with the FITC-labeled anti-
body for 45 min at 4°C. Virus binding was analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry.

Syncytia assays
Analysis of syncytium formation was carried out as described
previously (San Roman et al. 2002). CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells
were plated on a 12-well plate for 24 h before infection.
rZJ1-GFP at an MOI of 1 was left to be adsorbed for 1 h at
37°C;
the inoculum was removed and the cells
were incubated in complete αMEM for 16 h. The cells were
then ﬁxed with methanol for 10 min, stained with Giemsa,
and the number of syncytia (cells containing more than three
nuclei) was counted in 10 random areas of the well.

thereafter,

Virus growth kinetics
CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells were grown to conﬂuency in 35 mm
dishes. After the removal of the growth media, the cells were
washed twice with serum-free αMEM and rZJ1-GFP
was added to each dish at an MOI of 0.01. After incubation
for 1 h at 37°C with frequent shaking, the virus inoculum was
removed and 3 mL of αMEM containing 1% fetal calf serum.
The cells were constantly observed for the CPE. At
the
assigned time, nearly 300 μL of supernatant was harvested
and replenished with the same amount of fresh medium.
Collected supernatants were stored in aliquots at −70°C for
virus titration. Virus titers were determined by inoculation of
10-fold serial virus dilutions into CEF cells and counting by
GFP autoﬂuorescence under ﬂuorescence microscopy as
described previously (Engel-Herbert et al. 2003; Zhang et al.
2005). Average virus titers (expressed as log10 TCID50/mL)
were calculated using the Reed and Muench method (Reed
and Muench 1938).
