Members of the bacterial phylum Planctomycetes inhabit various aquatic and terrestrial
environments. In this study, ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied to assess
the abundance and depth distribution of these bacteria in nine different acidic wetlands
of Northern Russia. Planctomycetes were most abundant in the oxic part of the wet-
land proﬁles. The respective cell numbers were in the range 1.1–6.7× 107 cells g−1 of wet
peat, comprising 2–14% of total bacterial cells, and displaying linear correlation to the
peat water pH. Most peatland sites showed a sharp decline of planctomycete abundance
with depth, while in two particular sites this decline was followed by a second popula-
tion maximum in an anoxic part of the bog proﬁle. Oxic peat layers were dominated by
representatives of the Isosphaera–Singulisphaera group, while anoxic peat was inhabited
mostly by Zavarzinella- and Pirellula-like planctomycetes. Phylogenetically related bacteria
of the candidate division OP3 were detected in both oxic and anoxic peat layers with cell
densities of 0.6–4.6

106 cells g−1 of wet peat.

INTRODUCTION
The phylum Planctomycetes
is a remarkable group of bud-
ding bacteria that possess highly distinctive cell morphology,
peptidoglycan-less cell-walls, and a unique cell organization
(Schlesner and Stackebrandt, 1986; Fuerst, 1995; Ward et al., 2006;
Fuerst and Sagulenko, 2011). Members of this phylum are ubiq-
uitous in a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial environments
with diverse conditions. Recently, it was found that planctomycetes
are highly abundant in acidic Sphagnum-dominated wetlands
(Dedysh et al., 2006; Kulichevskaya et al., 2006). Several mod-
erately acidophilic, peat-inhabiting planctomycetes were isolated
in pure cultures and described as representatives of the novel gen-
era Schlesneria, Singulisphaera, and Zavarzinella (Kulichevskaya
et al., 2007b, 2008, 2009, 2012). Interestingly, ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) with the 16S rRNA-targeted, Planctomycete-
speciﬁc oligonucleotide probes revealed two distinct population
maxima of these bacteria within the proﬁle of the peat bog Bakchar,
West Siberia (Dedysh et al., 2006; Ivanova and Dedysh, 2006). The
ﬁrst population maximum was detected in the uppermost, oxic
layer of the bog proﬁle, while the second maximum was located at
a depth of 30 cm below the water table level. Since all currently
characterized peat-inhabiting planctomycetes are chemoorgan-
otrophs capable of growth in aerobic or microaerobic but not in
anoxic conditions (Kulichevskaya et al., 2007b, 2008, 2009, 2012),
the present study was initiated in order to examine depth distri-
bution of these bacteria in different types of northern wetlands
and to compare planctomycete diversity in oxic and anoxic peat
layers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLING SITES
The peat samples were collected from the depths 0–10, 10–20,
20–30, 30–40, and 40–50 cm over the proﬁles of nine different

acidic wetlands of West Siberia and European North Russia
(Table 1). The trophic status of these wetlands varied from olig-
otrophic to eutrophic and the pH varied from 3.7 to 6.0. Six
oligotrophic wetlands (Bakchar, Obukhovskoye, Sekirnoye, Tor-
fjanoye, Dubrovskoye, and Valdayskoye) are dominated by Sphag-
num mosses. Aapa-type mesotrophic fen Muksalma is covered by
Calluna vulgaris and Carex spp., while two eutrophic fens, Obskoe
and Blizhnee, are dominated by Carex spp. Three subsamples col-
lected from each depth were combined to form one composite
sample per site. The samples were transported to the laboratory in
boxes containing icepacks, homogenized by cutting the peat mate-
rial into small fragments (about 0.5 cm) with sterile scissors, and
ﬁxed for FISH or frozen at−20˚C for DNA extraction within 1 day
after sampling.

FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION
The ﬁxation procedure was carried out according to Dedysh et al.
(2001) and included (i) the separation of the peat water enriched
with microbial cells and micro-particles of non-decomposed
organic material from the rough (≥2–3 mm) Sphagnum debris
by repeated stomacher treatments, (ii) recovery of the microbial
cells from the peat water, and (iii) cell ﬁxation with 4% (w/v)
freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution. Total bacterial cell
numbers were determined by means of hybridization with Cy3-
labeled oligonucleotide probes EUB338-mix (Daims et al., 1999).
A combination of two Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes PLA46
and PLA886 (Neef et al., 1998) was applied for speciﬁc detec-
tion of planctomycetes. A set of eight oligonucleotide probes was
used for differential detection and enumeration of speciﬁc sub-
groups within the Planctomycetes (Table 2). This set included
the probe NLMIII 301 designed by Liu and Seviour (2001) for
members of the Isosphaera-group and seven newly developed
probes for speciﬁc detection of peat-inhabiting planctomycetes.

of the samples. The ﬁxed samples were applied to these wells,
hybridized to the corresponding ﬂuorescent probes, and stained
(cid:3)
with the universal DNA stain 4
,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI, 1 μM) as described earlier (Dedysh et al., 2001). The
cell counts were carried out with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope
(Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with the Zeiss Filters No 20
and 02 for Cy3-labeled probes and DAPI staining, respectively.
Cell counting was performed on 100 randomly chosen ﬁelds of
view (FOV) for each test sample. The number of target cells per
gram of wet peat was determined from the area of the sample
spot, the FOV area, the volume of the ﬁxed sample used for
hybridization, and the volume of the peat water extracted from
the sample.

DNA EXTRACTION
Extracts of total DNA were obtained from two peat samples
collected from the uppermost, oxic (0–10 cm depth) peat layers
of Obukhovskoye and Bakchar peat bogs, and one peat sample
collected from the anoxic (30–40 cm depth) layer of the peat
bog Bakchar. Two subsamples, each of 0.5 g wet weight, were
taken from each peat sample and processed separately. The extrac-
tion was performed using a FastDNA SPIN kit for Soil (Bio101,
Carlsbad, USA) according to manufacturer’s instruction.

branch points obtained in neighbor-joining analysis were deter-
mined by bootstrap analyses (1000 data resamplings) using the
PHYLIP program package (Felsenstein, 1989). The 16S rRNA gene
sequences retrieved from Sphagnum peat in this study have been
deposited in the GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ nucleotide sequence
databases under accession numbers JN867640 to JN867719.

RESULTS
ABUNDANCE OF PLANCTOMYCETES IN NORTHERN WETLANDS
We applied a combination of two planctomycete-speciﬁc oligonu-
cleotide probes PLA46 and PLA886 to determine the in situ
abundance of these bacteria in peat sampled from nine acidic wet-
lands of different geographic locations within European North
Russia and West Siberia (Table 1). The probes hybridized to
numerous spherical or ellipsoid-shaped cells that were arranged
in chains or in shapeless cell aggregates and were mostly attached
to the particles of non-decomposed organic material (Figure 1).
Highest abundances of cells targeted with the probes PLA46
and PLA886 were observed in the uppermost, oxic layers of the

PCR AMPLIFICATION, CLONING, AND SEQUENCING
PCR-mediated ampliﬁcation of the 16S rRNA gene fragments
(∼1350 bp) of peat-inhabiting planctomycetes was performed
using the combination of the Planctomycete-speciﬁc forward
primer Pla46 (5
) targeting
positions 46–63 of Escherichia coli 16S rRNA gene (Neef et al.,
(cid:3)
1998) and the universal bacterial reverse primer Univ1390R (5
-
GAC GGG CGG TGT GTA CAA-3
; Zheng et al., 1996). PCR
mixtures (100 μl) contained 1 μl of template DNA, 50 μl of 2×
MasterMix (Promega), and 0.3 μM of each primer (Syntol). PCR
ampliﬁcations were performed in a DNA thermal cycler (model
9700; PE Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions:
initial denaturation (4 min at 94˚C), 33 cycles consisting of denat-
uration (1 min at 94˚C), primer annealing (1 min at 59˚C), and
elongation (1.5 min at 72˚C), with a ﬁnal elongation step for
7 min at 72˚C. Aliquots (5 μl) of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons
were checked on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel and visualized after
being stained with ethidium bromide. In order to reduce the
potential bias of separate PCR reactions, the amplicons of two
independent PCRs were combined before cloning. The mixed
PCR product was cloned using a pGEM-T Easy Vector Sys-
tem II (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Clones were screened for the correct insert with T7 and SP6
primers. Plasmid DNA was puriﬁed using Wizard Plus Minipreps
DNA Puriﬁcation System (Promega) and the cloned inserts were
sequenced using an ABI 377A sequencer (Perkin–Elmer Applied
Biosystems, USA).

The 16S rRNA gene sequences were checked for chimeras using
Bellerophon 3.0 with the Huber–Hugenholtz correction and a
300 bp window size (Huber et al., 2004). Sequence alignments
and phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the ARB soft-
ware package (Ludwig et al., 2004). Trees were constructed using
the neighbor-joining method. The signiﬁcance levels of interior

wetland proﬁles (Table 1; Figure 2). The cell numbers of planc-
tomycetes in these layers were in the range 1.1–6.7× 107 cells g
−1
of wet peat, comprising 2–14% of cells detected in peat with the
Bacteria-speciﬁc probe Eub338-mix. The abundance of plancto-
mycetes in wetlands was strongly and positively correlated with
pH value of peat water (r = 0.897; p value < 0.002; Figure 3).
Highest cell numbers of these bacteria were detected in mildly
acidic (pH 5.3–6.0) fens, whereas low planctomycete abundance
was more typical for more acidic (pH 3.7–4.5) ombrotrophic bogs.
By contrast, we did not observe any correspondence between
the pH value of peat water and the cell numbers determined
by hybridization with the Bacteria-speciﬁc probe Eub338-mix
(Table 1).

Most peatland sites showed a sharp decline of planctomycete
abundance with depth, while in two particular sites (wetlands
Bakchar and Blizhnee) this decline was followed by a second pop-
ulation maximum in an anoxic part of the wetland proﬁle (Tukey’s
HSD test, p < 0.05; Figures 2A,I).

CULTURE-INDEPENDENT IDENTIFICATION OF PEAT-INHABITING
PLANCTOMYCETES
A total of eighty 16S rRNA gene clones were randomly selected for
sequencing and analyzed phylogenetically. The sequences retrieved
from the oxic peat layer of the peat bog Obukhovskoye were abbre-
viated O-Ox. The sequences obtained from the oxic and anoxic
peat from the peat bog Bakchar were abbreviated B-Ox and B-
An (Figure 4). Comparative sequence analysis showed that 74 of
eighty 16S rRNA gene sequences afﬁliate with the order Planc-
tomycetales of the phylum Planctomycetes. None of the sequences
retrieved in this study belonged to Anammox-planctomycetes (Jet-
ten et al., 2005, 2010). Finally, six clones displayed high sequence
similarity (97.3–99.3%) to the environmental clone sequence B39
(AM162486) retrieved from the West Siberian peat bog Bakchar in
our previous study (Dedysh et al., 2006) and to two other environ-
mental clone sequences, Molly56 (AY775515, 95–96% similarity)
and Molly91 (AY775535, 93–94% similarity) retrieved from a
Sphagnum peat bog in New England, USA (Morales et al., 2006).

Taken together, these clones formed a separate phylogenetic cluster
and belonged to the sub-lineage V within the candidate division
OP3 (Glöckner et al., 2010).

The clone libraries constructed for two oxic peat samples
from wetlands in West Siberia (peat bog Bakchar) and European
North Russia (peat bog Obukhovskoye) had highly similar com-
position. More than half of all clones (53–61%) in both clone
libraries afﬁliated with the phylogenetic lineage deﬁned by the
genera Isosphaera and Singulisphaera. None of the peat-derived
sequences, however, displayed high similarity (≥97%) to those in
taxonomically described members of this lineage. A group of 14
cloned 16S rRNA gene sequences showed only a distant relation-
ship (88.8–92.8% sequence similarity) to 16S rRNA gene sequence
from Isosphaera pallida, a neutrophilic ﬁlamentous planctomycete
from a hot spring (Giovannoni et al., 1987; Figure 4). Another
group of 18 clones displayed moderate similarity (93.8–95.5%) to
16S rRNA gene sequences of acidophilic peat-inhabiting plancto-
mycete Singulisphaera acidiphila (Kulichevskaya et al., 2008) and
of taxonomically uncharacterized planctomycete from activated
sludge, “Nostocoida limicola III” (Liu et al., 2001). The second
abundant group of sequences (25–35% of all clones) obtained
from oxic peat belonged to the phylogenetic lineage deﬁned by
the genera Gemmata and Zavarzinella. Four clones belonged to
the Planctomyces-like group and displayed high sequence simi-
larity (98.0–98.8%) to the 16S rRNA gene sequence of another
characterized peat-inhabiting planctomycete Schlesneria paludi-
cola (Kulichevskaya et al., 2007b). Finally, only two clones afﬁliated
with Pirellula-like planctomycetes.

By contrast, most 16S rRNA gene sequences (45% of all
clones) retrieved from the anoxic peat sample clustered within the
group deﬁned by the genus Pirellula. These sequences displayed
only a distant relationship (85.7–89.7% sequence similarity) to

those from taxonomically described representatives of this planc-
tomycete group, but were highly similar (95.2–98.7%) to the
environmental clone sequences Molly75 (AY775524), Molly19
(AY775494), and B86 (AM162476) obtained from Sphagnum-
dominated wetlands in the USA and Russia (Dedysh et al., 2006;
Morales et al., 2006). One-fourth of all sequences retrieved from
anoxic peat belonged to the Gemmata–Zavarzinella-related group
of planctomycetes. Four of these sequences displayed high simi-
larity (99.5–99.7%) to 16S rRNA gene sequence of Zavarzinella
formosa (Kulichevskaya et al., 2009). This planctomycete was
described as an aerobic organism, which is not capable of growth in
micro-oxic or anoxic conditions. Minor groups of clones in a clone
library made of anoxic peat were the sequences from Isosphaera–
Singulisphaera-like (15% of all clones) and Schlesneria-like (5%)
planctomycetes.

DIFFERENTIAL DETECTION OF SPECIFIC SUB-GROUPS OF
PLANCTOMYCETES OVER THE BOG PROFILE
Since the clone library composition may not adequately reﬂect
the quantitative proportion of different bacterial groups within
microbial communities, we attempted to assess the population
structure of peat-inhabiting planctomycetes by means of FISH
with the probes designed for differential detection of speciﬁc sub-
groups within the Planctomycetes (Table 2). Six of these probes
were developed in this study based on 16S rRNA gene sequences
of the recently described acidophilic planctomycetes, S. paludi-
cola, S. acidiphila, and Z. formosa, and related environmental clone
sequences retrieved from acidic peat. One additional probe, B39–
620, was designed to speciﬁcally target the OP3-related group of
bacteria from Sphagnum-dominated wetlands. The target speci-
ﬁcity of all probes applied in this study is indicated by brackets in
Figure 4.

Diversity of peat-inhabiting Planctomycetes

The set of probes listed in Table 2 was applied to assess the
depth distribution of speciﬁc planctomycete groups in the peat bog
Bakchar,West Siberia (Figure 5). The largest detectable population
of indigenous planctomycetes hybridized with a probe targeting
members of the Isosphaera–Singulisphaera group (Figure 5A).
The population size of
these planctomycetes declined from
3.7× 107 cells g
−1 wet peat in the uppermost, oxic peat layer
to 0.1× 107 cells g
−1 wet peat at a depth of 40–50 cm. Repre-
sentatives of the genus Schlesneria were signiﬁcantly less abun-
dant but showed the same distribution trend, with the popu-
lation maximum in oxic peat (5.0× 106 cells g
−1 wet peat) ver-
sus population minimum (0.2× 106 cells g
−1 wet peat) in anoxic
part of the bog proﬁle (Figure 5B). The number of cells tar-
geted with Pirellula-speciﬁc probe AnPir-422 was in the range
of 1.0–2.1× 106 cells g
−1 wet peat and did not show signiﬁ-
cant variations within the bog proﬁle. The most unexpected
distribution pattern was observed for Zavarzinella-like planc-
tomycetes, which peaked up to 4.4× 106 cells g
−1 wet peat at
a depth of 30–40 cm. Finally, a minor but clearly detectable
population of spherical cells hybridized with a probe target-
ing OP3-related organisms. These bacteria were enumerated at
0.6–4.6× 106 cells g
−1 wet peat, which accounted for 9–20% of
all cells targeted with the probes PLA46+ PLA886 (shown by
white in Figure 5A). Given that OP3-related bacteria do not
belong to the Planctomycetes (discussed below), we have corrected
our estimations of the planctomycete abundance in peat as fol-

lows: N planctomycetes = N PLA46+ PLA886 − N B39–620. The resulting
range of planctomycete abundance within the proﬁle of peat bog
Bakchar was 0.6–4.6× 107 cells g
−1 wet peat. The estimated over-
all coverage of the group-speciﬁc probes used in our study was
92–98%.

DISCUSSION
As evidenced by a number of recent studies, planctomycetes
densely colonize diverse acidic ecosystems, such as acidic north-
ern wetlands (Dedysh et al., 2006; Kulichevskaya et al., 2006; this
study), tank-forming bromeliads in tropical rainforests (Goffredi
et al., 2011), and acidic hot springs (Bohorquez et al., 2012).
Various water-saturated habitats with primarily decay-resistant
organic matter seem to be one of the preferred econiches of these

bacteria. The population size of planctomycetes in peatlands –
−1 of wet peat – is especially high in comparison to
107 cells g
many other ecosystems. For example, the peak of planctomycete
abundance, which is usually observed in marine habitats during a
−1 (Morris et al., 2006;
diatom bloom, corresponds to 104 cells ml
Pizzetti et al., 2011).

The highest population sizes of planctomycetes were revealed
in mildly acidic peat sampled from two eutrophic fens, Obskoe
(pH 6.0) and Blizhnee (pH 5.8), as well as in peat sampled from
ombrotrophic bog Dubrovskoye (pH 5.3). Vice versa, the low-
est numbers of cells targeted with the probes PLA46+ PLA886
were detected in more acidic (pH 3.7–4.1) peat bogs Bakchar,
Torfjanoye, and Valdayskoye. These data suggest that most peat-
inhabiting planctomycetes are moderately acidophilic bacteria
with pH growth optima similar to those in Schlesneria, Sin-
gulisphaera, and Zavarzinella (Kulichevskaya et al., 2007b, 2008,
2009, 2012).

The culture-independent analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences
retrieved from acidic peat using Planctomycetes-speciﬁc primer
pair revealed the presence of a highly diverse community,
which consisted mostly of as-yet-uncultivated and uncharacter-
ized planctomycetes. This highlights the need for further cultiva-
tion efforts in uncovering the Planctomycetes diversity in acidic
northern wetlands. Notably, none of the sequences retrieved in
our study belonged to Anammox-planctomycetes. This is not sur-
prising since only one anoxic peat sample was examined in our
study, and this particular sample was taken from an oligotrophic
Sphagnum peat bog where available forms of nitrogen are mostly
at very low or undetectable levels.

Based on the results of differential cell counts, we were
able to compare the planctomycete community structure in
oxic (0–10 cm depth) and anoxic (30–40 cm depth) peat lay-
ers (Figure 6). Oxic peat was dominated by members of the
Isosphaera–Singulisphaera group, which accounted for up to 80%
of all planctomycete cells detected by FISH. The second numeri-
cally signiﬁcant planctomycete group in oxic peat was represented
by members of the genus Schlesneria. By contrast, the most abun-
dant planctomycete population in anoxic peat was Zavarzinella-
like bacteria (45% of all planctomycete cells), while Isosphaera–
Singulisphaera and Pirellula-like planctomycetes accounted for

Diversity of peat-inhabiting Planctomycetes

FIGURE 6 | Community structure of planctomycetes in oxic (A) versus anoxic (B) peat: 1 – Isosphaera–Singulisphaera group, 2 – Zavarzinella-like

30 and 20% of all detectable planctomycetes, respectively. High
abundance of Zavarzinella-like planctomycetes in anoxic peat
is difﬁcult to explain based on the currently available infor-
mation. Z. formosa was originally described as an obligately
aerobic chemoheterotroph, which is not capable of growth in
microaerobic or anoxic conditions (Kulichevskaya et al., 2009).
Cultivation-independent retrieval of Zavarzinella-like 16S rRNA
gene sequences from anoxic peat prompted us to re-analyze the
ability of these planctomycetes to grow in anoxic conditions using
the only currently available strain of these bacteria, Z. formosa
A10T, but the result was negative. Possibly, other members of
this genus may differ from the single taxonomically characterized
representative by a number of traits. The occurrence of Pirellula-
like planctomycetes in anoxic environments was well-documented
before (Derakshani et al., 2001; Chouari et al., 2003; Kirkpatrick
et al., 2006; Elshahed et al., 2007).

Based on our current knowledge, planctomycetes are slow-
acting decomposers of plant-derived organic matter. They were
identiﬁed as a numerically abundant component of a bacterial
community that develops in the course of Sphagnum moss decom-
position (Kulichevskaya et al., 2007a). Notably, the cell numbers
of planctomycetes increased at the ﬁnal stage of decomposition
process. Given also that all currently characterized peat-inhabiting
planctomycetes are capable of degrading heteropolysaccharides
but not cellulose or chitin (Kulichevskaya et al., 2007b, 2008, 2009,
2012), the role of primary degraders is unlikely to be attributed
to this group of bacteria. Yet, the biogeochemical role of planc-
tomycetes in peatlands remains to be clariﬁed since characterized
representatives make only a minor part of the whole planctomycete
diversity in acidic wetlands.

Our study provided the ﬁrst quantitative estimation of the
OP3-related bacteria in acidic wetlands. Candidate division OP3

(Obsidian Pool 3) was originally described based on a single
16S rRNA gene sequence retrieved from Obsidian Pool sedi-
ment (Hugenholtz et al., 1998). Later, OP3-related 16S rRNA
gene sequences were obtained from a ﬂooded paddy soil using
a forward PCR primer PLA-40F that was designed for speciﬁc
detection of the phyla Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia (Der-
akshani et al., 2001). Recent phylogenetic analysis of all currently
available OP3-related 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that
they represent at least ﬁve different subdivision level lineages,
and the sequences retrieved from Sphagnum wetlands belong
to the sub-lineage V (Glöckner et al., 2010). So far, OP3 bacte-
ria were detected mostly in anoxic environments. The metage-
nomic analysis revealed that they share a high proportion of
orthologs with members of the Deltaproteobacteria and appear
to be capable of anaerobic respiration (Glöckner et al., 2010). In
our study, we detected these bacteria in both oxic and anoxic
parts of the bog proﬁle, which suggests that at least mem-
bers of the sub-lineage V may possess a facultatively anaerobic
lifestyle.

In summary, we revealed the presence of a highly abundant
and diverse community of Planctomycetes in acidic northern wet-
lands. These bacteria inhabit both oxic and anoxic peat layers and
belong mostly to as-yet-undescribed taxa. Further work is needed,
therefore, to characterize the unknown planctomycetes found in
this habitat and to explore their physiology and functional role in
wetlands.
