In human and non-human primates, ﬁloviruses (Ebola and Marburg viruses) cause severe
hemorrhagic fever. Recently, other animals such as pigs and some species of fruit bats
have also been shown to be susceptible to these viruses. While having a preference for
some cell types such as hepatocytes, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and
macrophages, ﬁloviruses are known to be pantropic in infection of primates. The envelope
glycoprotein (GP) is responsible for both receptor binding and fusion of the virus enve-
lope with the host cell membrane. It has been demonstrated that ﬁlovirus GP interacts
with multiple molecules for entry into host cells, whereas none of the cellular molecules
so far identiﬁed as a receptor/co-receptor fully explains ﬁlovirus tissue tropism and host
range. Available data suggest that the mucin-like region (MLR) on GP plays an important
role in attachment to the preferred target cells, whose infection is likely involved in ﬁlovirus
pathogenesis, whereas the MLR is not essential for the fundamental function of the GP in
viral entry into cells in vitro. Further studies elucidating the mechanisms of cellular entry of
ﬁloviruses may shed light on the development of strategies for prophylaxis and treatment
of Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers.

INTRODUCTION
Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), classiﬁed as
biosafety level 4 agents, belong to the Family Filoviridae. Whereas
MARV consists of a single species, Lake Victoria Marburgvirus,
there are four distinct EBOV species, including Zaire ebolavirus
(ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Côte d’Ivoire ebolavirus
(CIEBOV), Reston ebolavirus (REBOV), and the proposed new
species Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) (Sanchez et al., 2007;
Towner et al., 2008) (Figure 1 left). Among these, ZEBOV, ﬁrst
identiﬁed in 1976, seems to be the most virulent, killing approx-
imately up to 90% of infected individuals, whereas REBOV,
which was initially isolated from cynomolgus monkeys imported
from the Philippines into the USA in 1989, is less pathogenic
in experimentally infected non-human primates (Fisher-Hoch
and McCormick, 1999) and has never caused lethal infection in
humans (Sanchez et al., 2007).

Ebola virus and Marburg virus are ﬁlamentous, enveloped,
non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses
(Figure 2). The viral genome encodes seven structural proteins,
nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase cofactor (VP35), matrix pro-
tein (VP40), glycoprotein (GP), replication-transcription protein
(VP30), minor matrix protein (VP24), and RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (L). EBOV also expresses at least one secreted non-
structural glycoprotein (sGP). Figure 3 summarizes ﬁlovirus repli-
cation in cells. At the ﬁrst step of replication, viral attachment
through interaction between GP and some cellular molecules
is followed by endocytosis, including macropinocytosis (Nanbo
et al., 2010; Saeed et al., 2010). Subsequent fusion of the viral
envelope with the host cell endosomal membrane releases the
viral proteins (i.e., NP, VP35, VP30, and L) and RNA genome
into the cytoplasm, the site of replication. Transcription of the
negative-sense viral RNA by the viral polymerase complex (VP35

and L) yields mRNAs that are translated at cellular ribosomes.
During replication, full-length positive-sense copies of the viral
genome are synthesized. They subsequently serve as templates for
replication of negative-sense viral RNA synthesis. At the plasma
membrane, NP-encapsidated full-length viral RNAs and the other
viral structural proteins are assembled with VP40 and GP and
incorporated into enveloped virus particles that bud from the cell-
surface (Noda et al., 2006; Bharat et al., 2011). Though ﬁloviruses
show broad tissue tropism, hepatocytes, endothelial cells, dendritic
cells, monocytes, and macrophages are thought to be their pre-
ferred target cells, and infection of these cells is important for
hemorrhagic manifestation and immune disorders (Geisbert and
Hensley, 2004).

FILOVIRUS HOST RANGE
Filoviruses are known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever in
human and non-human primates, but recent studies suggest
that quadrupeds are also naturally susceptible to EBOV infec-
tion (Figure 1, right). In 2008–2009, REBOV infection was con-
ﬁrmed for the ﬁrst time in pigs in the Philippines (Barrette et al.,
2009). REBOV was occasionally isolated from the samples sub-
jected to the diagnostic investigation of multiple outbreaks of a
respiratory and abortion disease syndrome in swine, which were
caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus,
common in pigs in Asia. It is speculated that REBOV became
detectable, most likely due to the coinfection with this porcine
virus. Although pathogenicity of these swine REBOV strains to
humans, non-human primates, or even pigs remains unclear, other
EBOV species (i.e., ZEBOV) was shown to cause severe respi-
ratory disease in experimentally infected pigs (Kobinger et al.,
2011). During the 2001–2003 ZEBOV outbreaks in Gabon and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), when large numbers of

for efﬁcient replication in mice and guinea pigs, suggesting the
importance of some other mechanisms underlying in viral repli-
cation and/or immune evasion, as shown in the pathogenesis of
inﬂuenza virus (Fukuyama and Kawaoka, 2011).

FILOVIRUS ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN
The fourth gene from the 3
end of the ﬁlovirus genome encodes
the viral envelope GP (Figure 2), which is responsible for both
receptor binding and fusion of the virus envelope with the host
cell membrane (Takada et al., 1997; Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1998)
(Figures 3 and 4). GP is highly glycosylated with large amounts of
N- and O-linked glycans, most of which are uniformly located in
the middle one-third of the GP, designated the mucin-like region
(MLR) (Yang et al., 2000; Manicassamy et al., 2007). The amino
acid sequences of the MLR are highly variable among ﬁlovirus
species (Sanchez et al., 1996, 1998). GP undergoes proteolytic
cleavage by host proteases such as furin (Volchkov et al., 1998),
which produces two subunits, GP1 and GP2, linked by a disul-
ﬁde bond. The GP1 subunit mediates viral attachment, most
likely through the MLR or the putative receptor binding region
(RBR; Kuhn et al., 2006; Dube et al., 2009). The GP2 subunit
has the heptad repeat regions required for assembling GP as a
trimer. The hydrophobic fusion loop on GP2 is thought to catalyze
fusion of the viral envelope and host cell membrane (Weissenhorn
et al., 1998; Ito et al., 1999). Although the trigger to promote the
conformational change leading to membrane fusion is not fully
understood, it was recently suggested that endosomal proteolysis
of EBOV and MARV GPs by cysteine proteases such as cathepsins
B and L plays an important role in inducing membrane fusion
(Chandran et al., 2005; Schornberg et al., 2006; Matsuno et al.,
2010a). Since GP is the only viral surface GP, it is believed to have
an important role in controlling the tropism and pathogenesis
of ﬁlovirus infection (Takada and Kawaoka, 2001; Hoenen et al.,
2006; Sanchez et al., 2007).

PSEUDOTYPE VIRUS SYSTEM TO SEARCH FOR FILOVIRUS
RECEPTORS/CORECEPTORS
In the early years, studies of ﬁloviruses were hampered by its extra-
ordinary pathogenicity, which requires biosafety level 4 contain-
ment. To circumvent this problem, pseudotype virus systems for
functional analysis of ﬁlovirus GPs have been established (Takada
et al., 1997; Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1998). The systems rely on
recombinant viruses (e.g., replication-competent or -incompetent
vesicular stomatitis virus and retroviruses) that contain ﬁlovirus
GP instead of their own GPs (Figure 5). Such pseudotype virus
systems enable us to investigate cell tropism mediated by simple
interaction between ﬁlovirus GP and its cellular ligands. Using
such a system, it was shown that pseudotyped viruses infected pri-
mate cells more efﬁciently than any of the other mammalian or
avian cells examined, in a manner consistent with the host range
tropism of Ebola virus, and that cell-surface GPs with N-linked
oligosaccharide chains might contribute to the entry of Ebola
viruses, presumably acting as a speciﬁc receptor and/or cofac-
tor for virus entry (Takada et al., 1997). Furthermore, ﬁlovirus
receptor-deﬁcient cell lines that have been used in expression
cloning strategies searching for ﬁlovirus entry mediators were dis-
covered in an early study (Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1998). Thus,

FIGURE 1 | Phylogenetic analysis of ﬁlovirus GP amino acid sequences.
The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method.
For construction of this tree, ten complete GP amino acid sequences were
used. Infectious viruses were isolated or viral genome and/or speciﬁc
antibodies were detected (in parentheses) from the animals shown on the
right.

gorillas and chimpanzees were infected, the viral genome was also
detected in duikers, medium-sized Bovid related to antelopes and
gazelles (Leroy et al., 2004). It was also reported that several dogs in
the ZEBOV-epidemic area might have been highly exposed to the
virus by eating infected dead animals, as suggested by high sero-
prevalence, but the putative infection seems to be asymptomatic
(Allela et al., 2005).

Infectious MARV was recently isolated from Egyptian fruit bats
(Rousettus aegyptiacus) in Uganda, indicating that this species is
susceptible to MARV infection and potentially acts as the natural
reservoir of the virus (Towner et al., 2009). Phylogenetic analy-
sis showed that viruses in the bats were closely related to those
isolated from victims of the 2007 MARV outbreak in Uganda,
providing the ﬁrst evidence for an epidemiological link between
viruses in bats and hemorrhagic fever outbreak in humans. On
the other hand, EBOV has not been isolated from any bat species.
During the 2001–2003 EBOV outbreaks in Gabon and DRC, how-
ever, fruit bats (Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and
Myonycteris torquata) captured in the outbreak area were found
to have EBOV genomic RNA and virus-speciﬁc antibodies (Leroy
et al., 2005), suggesting they are potential natural reservoirs for
EBOV. However, it is still unclear whether these bats continuously
maintain EBOV and/or MARV and act as a potential source of
ﬁlovirus transmission to humans.

It has been shown that laboratory animals, including mice and
guinea pigs, are susceptible to ﬁlovirus infection. However, these
animals infected with ﬁloviruses obtained from patients normally
develop a non-lethal illness, though the viruses have the ability to
replicate in the animals. Guinea pigs have been used as an animal
model for ﬁlovirus infection since serial passage of MARV and
EBOV in the animals results in a substantial increase in lethal-
ity (Bowen et al., 1980; Hevey et al., 1997; Volchkov et al., 2000;
Subbotina et al., 2010). It was also demonstrated that passages
of ZEBOV through young mice resulted in the selection of vari-
ants with pathogenicity associated with mutations in viral internal
genes (e.g., NP and VP40) (Bray et al., 1998; Ebihara et al., 2006).
This mouse-adapted ZEBOV is highly lethal to mice. Similarly, a
mouse model for MARV infection has been established (Warﬁeld
et al., 2009). Interestingly, mutations found in the GP gene of these
mouse- or guinea pig-adapted viruses were not the primary factor

CELLULAR MOLECULES IDENTIFIED AS UBIQUITOUS
RECEPTORS FOR FILOVIRUS ENTRY
Although ﬁloviruses can replicate in various tissues and cell types,
the molecular mechanisms of their broad tropism remain poorly

understood (Figure 6). By using an expression cloning strategy
that has been used to identify several virus receptors, human
folate receptor-α was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a ubiquitous cellular cofac-
tor that mediates infection by both MARV and ZEBOV (Chan
et al., 2001). This molecule is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-
linked protein expressed on the cell-surface. However, a human
immunodeﬁciency virus pseudotyped with EBOV GP could not

or caveola/lipid raft-mediated endocytic mechanisms, suggesting
that Axl enhances macropinocytosis (Hunt et al., 2011). However,
direct interactions between these cellular molecules and the GP
RBR remain to be demonstrated.

Recently, a bioinformatics approach, comparative genetics
analysis, was used to screen the candidate genes involved in ZEBOV
entry and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1)
was identiﬁed as a candidate ZEBOV and MARV cellular receptor
by correlation analysis between the gene expression proﬁles and
permissiveness to viral infection (Kondratowicz et al., 2011). TIM-
1 was shown to bind to the RBR of ZEBOV GP, and ectopic TIM-1
expression in poorly permissive cells enhanced EBOV infection. In
addition, reduction of cell-surface expression of TIM-1 by RNAi
decreased infection of highly permissive Vero cells, which are com-
monly used for ﬁlovirus propagation. However, the fact that not all
cell types that are naturally permissive for ﬁloviruses express the
above-mentioned molecules implies that ﬁloviruses may utilize
multiple cellular proteins for infection of a wide variety of cells.
More recent studies suggest that endo/lysosomal cholesterol trans-
porter protein Niemann–Pick C1 (NPC1) is essential for ﬁlovirus
infection, providing a model of EBOV infection in which cleavage
of the GP1 subunit by endosomal cathepsin removes heavily gly-
cosylated regions to expose the putative RBR, which is a ligand for
NPC1 and mediates membrane fusion by the GP2 subunit (Carette
et al., 2011; Côté et al., 2011). Available data indicate that the
cellular tropism of ﬁloviruses does not necessarily match the dis-
tribution of any cellular molecules so far identiﬁed. Importantly,
it remains elusive whether these molecules act as functional recep-
tors that mediate both viral attachment and membrane fusion or as
so-called co-receptors whose interaction with viral GP is required
only for membrane fusion.

MUCIN-LIKE REGION
Both MARV and EBOV GPs contain both N- and O-linked car-
bohydrate chains with different terminal sialylation patterns that
seem to depend on the virus strains and cell lines used for their
propagation. The MLR contains a number of potential N- and O-
linked glycosylation sites as mentioned above. Though the MLR
is found in all known ﬁlovirus GPs, its highly variable amino acid
sequences and sugar chain structure suggest different GP proper-
ties among ﬁlovirus species. Interestingly, it is well documented
that deletion of the MLR does not affect the fundamental func-
tion of GP in viral entry into cells in vitro, as indicated by the
observation that pseudotyped viruses bearing GP lacking the MLR
infect primate epithelial cells (e.g.,Vero E6 cells) similarly or rather
more efﬁciently than viruses with wild-type GP (Simmons et al.,
2002; Takada et al., 2004; Matsuno et al., 2010a). According to the
crystal structure of ZEBOV GP in its trimeric, prefusion confor-
mation, the MLR may restrict access of the putative RBR to virus
receptors (Lee et al., 2008). Thus, pseudotyped viruses bearing
MLR-deletion mutant GP have often been used for approaches to
identify ﬁlovirus-speciﬁc receptors (Shimojima et al., 2006; Kon-
dratowicz et al., 2011). However, the MLR plays an important role
in ﬁlovirus entry into preferred target cells such as endothelial cells,
hepatocytes, and antigen-presenting cells, whose infection is likely
involved in tropism and pathogenesis of ﬁloviruses, as described
below.

FIGURE 4 | Schematic diagram of ﬁlovirus glycoprotein. Both EBOV and
MARV GPs contain signal peptides (SP), putative RBR, MLR, furin cleavage
site, internal fusion loop (IFL), heptad repeat (HP), and transmembrane (TM)
regions.

FIGURE 5 | Schematic diagram of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
pseudotyped with ﬁlovirus GP. The pseudotype virus relies on a
recombinant virus that contains a reporter gene instead of the viral
envelope protein gene responsible for receptor-binding and membrane
fusion. Since ﬁlovirus glycoprotein is efﬁciently incorporated into VSV
particles, a recombinant VSV that contains the green ﬂuorescent protein
(GFP) gene, instead of the G protein gene can be generated. This virus is
not infectious unless the envelope protein responsible for receptor binding
and membrane fusion is provided in trans.

infect T-cell lines stably expressing this protein, suggesting that
folate receptor-α is not sufﬁcient to mediate entry (i.e., some other
molecules are required) (Simmons et al., 2003b; Sinn et al., 2003).
A similar approach identiﬁed members of the Tyro3 receptor tyro-
sine kinase family (Axl, Dtk, and Mer) as molecules involved
in cell entry of ﬁloviruses (Shimojima et al., 2006). Expression
of these family members in lymphoid cells, which are originally
non-permissive to ﬁloviruses, enhanced infection by pseudotype
viruses bearing ﬁlovirus GPs on their envelopes. These molecules
are widely distributed in many types of cells throughout the body,
though not on lymphocytes and granulocytes (Linger et al., 2008).

sion by RNAi treatment resulted in decreased ZEBOV entry via.

FIGURE 6 | Proposed models of ﬁlovirus entry into cells. Virus particles
attach to the cell-surface through the interaction between GP and some
cellular molecules (e.g., putative ubiquitous receptors, C-type lectins).
Following virus uptake and trafﬁcking to late endosomes, GP is cleaved by

cellular proteases such as cathepsins to remove heavily glycosylated regions
including the MLR and expose the RBR of GP1. Binding of cleaved GP1 to a
coreceptor (e.g., NPC1) might be necessary for the GP conformational
change leading to membrane fusion.

C-TYPE LECTINS AND THE MLR
C-type lectins are a family of Ca2+
-dependent carbohydrate-
recognition proteins that play crucial roles in innate immunity. It
has been demonstrated that membrane-anchored cellular C-type
lectins facilitate ﬁlovirus infection in vitro by binding to glycans
focused on the MLR (Figure 6). The asialoglycoprotein receptor, a
C-type lectin found exclusively in hepatocytes, initially proposed
as a receptor for Marburg virus (Becker et al., 1995), recognizes GPs
displaying N-linked sugar chains with terminal galactose residues
on the GP molecule and enhances ﬁlovirus infectivity. It was subse-
quently shown that carbohydrate chains on ﬁlovirus GP, especially
on the MLR, are recognized by other cellular C-type lectins such
as dendritic cell- and liver/lymph node-speciﬁc ICAM-3-grabbing
non-integrin (DC/L-SIGN) (Alvarez et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2003;
Simmons et al., 2003a; Marzi et al., 2004; Gramberg et al., 2008),
human macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin (hMGL) (Takada
et al., 2004; Matsuno et al., 2010a), and liver and lymph node
sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin) (Gramberg
et al., 2005; Dominguez-Soto et al., 2007; Powlesland et al., 2008).
Though these C-type lectins show different speciﬁcities, depend-
ing on the structures of target glycans, and thus MLR may not be
the only binding site for the lectins, all have been reported to pro-
mote ﬁlovirus entry. It should be noted that C-type lectins enhance
ﬁlovirus infectivity when expressed on the target cell-surface, but
are unlikely to act as functional receptors mediating both attach-
ment and membrane fusion (Simmons et al., 2003a; Marzi et al.,
2007; Matsuno et al., 2010b). The fact that interaction between
the GP MLR and C-type lectins is not essential for viral entry into

cells lacking C-type lectins (e.g., Vero E6 cells) may also suggest
that C-type lectins facilitate viral attachment but not infectious
entry.

Hepatocytes, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and
macrophages, all of which express C-type lectins, are thought to
be the preferred target cells of ﬁloviruses (Takada and Kawaoka,
2001; Geisbert and Hensley, 2004; Hoenen et al., 2006). Indeed,
primary macrophage and dendritic cell cultures transduced for
C-type lectin expression greatly increased their susceptibility to
virus infection (Simmons et al., 2003a; Marzi et al., 2007). While
C-type lectins do not directly mediate ﬁlovirus entry, their pat-
tern of expression in vivo and their ability to enhance infection
indicate that C-type lectins can play an important role in ﬁlovirus
transmission and tissue tropism. Thus, increased infection of these
cells might be directly involved in the pathogenesis of ﬁloviruses.
Accordingly, it was shown that soluble mannose-binding C-type
lectin played a role in protection from lethal Ebola virus infec-
tion in a mouse model (Michelow et al., 2011). It should be noted
that the ability to utilize the C-type lectins (i.e., DC-SIGN and
hMGL) to promote cellular entry was correlated with the differ-
ent pathogenicities among ﬁloviruses (Takada et al., 2004; Marzi
et al., 2006; Matsuno et al., 2010a). Interestingly, the MLR amino
acid sequence does not seem to be the primary factor contribut-
ing to the difference (Marzi et al., 2006; Matsuno et al., 2010a;
Usami et al., 2011). Although there might be some distinct mech-
anisms of entry between MARV and EBOV (Chan et al., 2000),
the similarity of tissue tropism and pathological features of infec-
tion between these viruses suggests that C-type lectins are one of

the important molecules, likely as attachment factors, for ﬁlovirus
entry into cells, and that they are directly involved in ﬁlovirus
tropism at the cellular level.

ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT ENHANCEMENT AND EPITOPES ON
THE MLR
In addition to the common receptor/co-receptor-dependent
mechanism of cellular attachment and membrane fusion, some
viruses utilize antiviral antibodies for their efﬁcient entry into tar-
get cells (Takada and Kawaoka, 2003). This mechanism is known
as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection.
Filoviruses utilize virus-speciﬁc antibodies for their entry into
cells in vitro through interaction between anti-GP antibodies and
the cellular Fc receptor (FcR) or complement component C1q
and its ligand, which likely promotes viral attachment to cells
(Takada et al., 2001, 2003a, 2007; Nakayama et al., 2011) (Figure 6).
FcR are expressed exclusively on the cells of the immune system
such as monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, B-cells, and gran-
ulocytes (Fanger and Guyre, 1992), whereas C1q ligands have
been identiﬁed in most mammalian cells (Eggleton et al., 1998;
Nicholson-Weller and Klickstein, 1999), suggesting a ubiquitous
mechanism for ADE of ﬁlovirus infection.

By using GP-speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies, several epitopes
recognized by ADE antibodies were identiﬁed and these epitopes
were mostly located in the MLR of the GP1 subunit (Takada
et al., 2007; Nakayama et al., 2011). It should be noted that neu-
tralizing antibodies appear to recognize different epitopes that
are not located on the MLR (Takada et al., 2003b; Lee et al.,
2008). As reﬂected by the high variability of the MLR amino
acid sequences and limited overall cross-reactivity of anti-sera
among ﬁlovirus species (i.e., ZEBOV, SEBOV, CIEBOV, BEBOV,
REBOV, and MARV), ADE activities of the anti-sera to GP are
virus-species-speciﬁc (Takada et al., 2001, 2007; Nakayama et al.,
2010). Interestingly, potential viral pathogenicity is correlated with
the ability to induce ADE antibodies, suggesting the possible con-
tribution of ADE to different pathogenicity between ﬁloviruses
(Takada et al., 2001; Nakayama et al., 2011). More importantly, the
demonstration of ADE of ﬁlovirus infection raises fundamental
questions about the development of GP-based vaccines and the
use of anti-GP antibodies for passive immunization.

Recently, GP has been used for viral vector-based or DNA vac-
cines that were shown to protect animals effectively. Replication-
incompetent adenovirus expressing GP, a replication-competent
vesicular stomatitis virus expressing GP, and a recombinant
paramyxovirus expressing GP have been shown to protect non-
human primates from lethal infections of ﬁloviruses (Sullivan

et al., 2000, 2003; Jones et al., 2005; Bukreyev et al., 2007;
Feldmann et al., 2007). It should be noted that these vaccines
potentially induce cytotoxic cellular response (i.e., CD8+ T lym-
phocytes) as well as antibody production, suggesting that acti-
vating cytotoxic T-cells is a key protective mechanism (Olinger
et al., 2005; Sullivan et al., 2006; Reed and Mohamadzadeh,
2007). Since cytotoxic T-cell response cannot be fully induced
by immunization with non-replicative protein antigens such
as inactivated virus and subunit vaccines, viral vector-based,
or DNA vaccines may be promising in preventing ﬁlovirus
infection.

CONCLUSION
All enveloped viruses initiate infection by attaching to host cells
followed by membrane fusion via interaction between viral sur-
face proteins and receptor/co-receptor molecules on target cells,
and this interaction is often a key determinant controlling viral
tissue tropism and/or host range. As described above, it has been
demonstrated that ﬁloviruses utilize multiple molecules for their
entry into cells. However, it remains elusive whether these mole-
cules serve as functional receptors mediating both viral attachment
and membrane fusion or play independent roles as either attach-
ment receptors or fusion receptors. More importantly, none of the
cellular molecules identiﬁed so far explains ﬁlovirus tissue tro-
pism and host range reasonably. It might also be hypothesized
that ﬁloviruses do not use a single common receptor to infect
a broad range of cells and, unlike many other viruses, may not
need a “speciﬁc” receptor. Although the overall tropism and path-
ogenicity of ﬁloviruses is controlled by multiple host cell factors
(e.g., interactions with the host immune system), further studies
aimed at identiﬁcation of cellular molecules interacting with GP
are needed to fully understand the mechanisms of cellular entry
of ﬁloviruses, and may shed light on the development of strategies
for prophylaxis and treatment of Marburg and Ebola hemorrhagic
fevers.
