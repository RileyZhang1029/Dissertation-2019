Carbohydrate derived fulvic acid (CHD-FA) is a heat stable low molecular weight, water
soluble, cationic, colloidal material with proposed therapeutic properties. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of CHD-FA against Candida albicans, and to
characterize its mode of action. A panel of C. albicans isolates (n = 50) derived from a
range of clinical specimens were grown planktonically and as bioﬁlms, and the minimum
inhibitory concentrations determined. Scanning electron microscopy was performed to
examine ultrastructural changes and different cell membrane assays were used to deter-
mine its mode of action. In addition, the role of C. albicans bioﬁlm resistance mechanisms
were investigated to determine their effects on CHD-FA activity. CHD-FA was active against
planktonic and sessile C. albicans at concentrations 0.125 and 0.25% respectively, and was
shown to be fungicidal, acting through disruption of the cell membrane activity. Resistance
mechanisms, including matrix, efﬂux, and stress, had a limited role upon CHD-FA activity.
Overall, based on the promising in vitro spectrum of activity and minimal bioﬁlm resistance
of the natural and cheap antiseptic CHD-FA, further studies are required to determine its
applicability for clinical use.

INTRODUCTION
Oral diseases such as oral candidosis, caries, and periodonti-
tis are characterized by microbial bioﬁlms (Coco et al., 2008),
which are difﬁcult to control with standard chemotherapeutic
approaches and host immune defenses (Ramage et al., 2010).
These bioﬁlm consortia have a community structure, dominant
metabolic processes and inter-organism interactions. Antimicro-
bial resistance is a key characteristic of bioﬁlms, which is associated
with exopolymeric matrix, increased cell density, persister cells,
and up-regulation of efﬂux pumps (Ramage et al., 2009). Recent
studies by our group demonstrated that Candida albicans bioﬁlms
were refractory to prescription antifungal agents, mouthwashes,
and denture cleansers (Jose et al., 2010; Ramage et al., 2011a). In
addition, Candida bioﬁlms in the oral cavity are associated with
inﬂammation and symptoms such as pain, burning sensation, and
altered taste (Samaranayake et al., 2009). Overall, these factors
complicate clinical management, therefore, alternative agents that
elicit antifungal activity are of clinical interest.

Fulvic acid is a novel antimicrobial molecule that is reported to
have antibacterial and antifungal properties (van Rensburg et al.,
2000). Moreover, it has been recently reported to be non-toxic
in a rat wound model, in addition to having anti-inﬂammatory
properties (Sabi et al., 2011). A recent randomized, double blind,
controlled trial indicated that fulvic acid was well-tolerated in a

study of eczema (Gandy et al., 2011). This colloidal organic acid is
a major constituent of humic acids and has been recognized for its
biological signiﬁcance for many years, yet there is minimal scien-
tiﬁc understanding on which to support the audacious claims of
its properties. Fulvic acid can be isolated from the environment or
produced from the oxidation of coal or lignite. Such preparations
contain high levels of heavy metals and potentially toxic elements,
making their use in humans unsuitable. Recent innovation has
seen the development of carbohydrate derived fulvic acid (CHD-
FA), a pure form of fulvic acid produced by a patented process to
GMP standards (PA107470/GB), rendering it free of heavy metals
and environmental pollutants normally found in fulvic acid from
environmental sources.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the antifungal
effects of CHD-FA, to determine whether it was active against
bioﬁlms and to deﬁne its mode of action. We report for the ﬁrst
time a highly effective novel antiseptic agent with exquisite bioﬁlm
activity that acts by disrupting cell membranes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CULTURE CONDITIONS AND STANDARDIZATION
Candida albicans type strains ATCC 90028, ATCC 10231, 3153A,
SC5314, CAF 2, and a range of clinical strains (n = 45) were
used for sensitivity testing. All working stocks of C. albicans were

maintained at 4˚C on Sabouraud (SAB; Oxoid, Cambridge, UK)
agar. Isolates were propagated in yeast peptone dextrose (YPD)
medium (Oxoid), washed by centrifugation, and resuspended in
RPMI-1640, as described previously (Ramage et al., 2001).

ANTIFUNGAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING OF PLANKTONIC CELLS AND
BIOFILMS
The following antifungal agents were used in the course of this
study: CHD-FA [Fulhold, Cape Town, South Africa (CAS: 479-66-
3)], voriconazole (VRZ, Pﬁzer Pharmaceuticals, Sandwich, UK),
caspofungin (CSP, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Hertfordshire, UK),
amphotericin B (AMB, Sigma, Poole, UK).

Antifungal testing to determine minimum inhibitory con-
centrations (MICs) of planktonic cells was performed using
the CLSI M-27A broth microdilution method (CLSI, 2008).
Bioﬁlms were formed and sessile susceptibility testing was per-
formed as previously described in commercially available pre-
sterilized, polystyrene, ﬂat-bottomed, 96-well microtiter plates
(Corning Incorporated, NY, USA; Ramage et al., 2001). Sessile
minimum inhibitory concentrations (SMICs) were determined
at 80% inhibition using an XTT [2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-
sulfo-phenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-caboxanilide] metabolic reduc-
tion assay (Pierce et al., 2008). Testing of all planktonic and sessile
isolates was performed in triplicate.

For time-kill studies four isolates were selected based on their
superior and equivalent bioﬁlm properties. These were grown and

treated with CHD-FA,VRZ, CSP, and AMB at 1, 2, and 4× SMIC50

to investigate whether these antifungals work in a dose dependent
manner. At 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h the bioﬁlms were carefully washed
and the metabolic activity of the bioﬁlms assessed (Pierce et al.,
2008). Testing of four isolates for each drug and each time-point
was performed with six replicates and on two separate occasions.

BIOFILM DISRUPTION AND ULTRASTRUCTURAL CHANGES
Candida albicans bioﬁlms (n = 40) were prepared and treated with
2 and 4× SMIC50 for 24 h as these concentrations of CHD-FA

were highly effective in the time-kill study above. Following treat-
ment the wells were washed carefully with PBS to quantify the
biomass of each bioﬁlm, as previously reported using a crystal
violet assay (Jose et al., 2010).

For scanning electron microscopy C. albicans 3153A sessile cells
were grown directly onto Thermanox™coverslips (Nunc, Roskilde,
Denmark) prior to antifungal treatment, whereas planktonic C.
albicans cells were ﬁrst pretreated with CHD-FA prior to immo-
bilization on the coverslip. Treatment was performed with all four

antifungal agents for 24 h at 1× SMIC90 for both planktonic and

sessile cells. These were then ﬁxed in 2% para-formaldehyde, 2%
glutaraldehyde and 0.15 M sodium cacodylate, and 0.15% w/v
Alcian Blue, pH 7.4, and prepared for SEM as previously described
(Erlandsen et al., 2004). The specimens were sputter-coated with
gold and viewed under a JEOL JSM-6400 scanning electron micro-
scope. Images were assembled using Photoshop software (Adobe,
San Jose, CA, USA).

MECHANISM OF ACTION
We investigated whether CHD-FA interacted with the membrane
using a propidium iodide (PI) uptake and ATP release assay.

First we standardized C. albicans (SC5314) to 5× 107 cells/ml in
RPMI-1640 and treated with CHD-FA at 4% for 10, 20, 30, 40,
50, and 60 min. Following treatment, cells were washed twice with
PBS, stained with 20 μM of PI and incubated at 37˚C for 15 min
to allow the dye to bind to DNA. Fluorescence was then measured
at excitation and emission wavelengths 535/617 nm, respectively.
Alternatively, cells in RPMI were plated onto an Ibidi μSlide VI
(Thistle Scientiﬁc, Glasgow, UK) and cultured for 60 min at 37˚C
before imaging on an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE300 using a ×20
objective lens.

ATP release was also quantiﬁed from collected supernatants.
These were buffered to pH 7.0 and equal volumes of supernatant
were added to ATP assay mix (Sigma-Aldrich, UK), and the assay
performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence
was then measured in a white 96-well plate (Corning Incorpo-
rated, NY, USA) using a microtiter plate reader (FLUOStar Omega,
BMG Labtech). Membrane assays were carried out in triplicate and
repeated at least twice.
We next investigated the contribution of chitin, using a speciﬁc
inhibitor of the chitin synthesis pathway± CHD-FA, to delineate
its mechanism of action. For planktonic cells CLSI methodolo-
gies were employed, with CHD-FA± nikkomycin Z (0.4 μg/ml),
which was incubated for 24 h at 37˚C. Sessile cells were grown in
the presence of nikkomycin Z for 24 h at 37˚C then treated with
CHD-FA for another 24 h. Following incubation of both plank-
tonic cells and bioﬁlms the metabolic activity was quantiﬁed using
the XTT reduction assay (Pierce et al., 2008). This assay was carried
out on two individual occasions, using two type and two clinical
strains tested in quadruplicate.

RESISTANCE MECHANISMS
The role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) was investigated
using a speciﬁc inhibitor of
the Hsp90 (17-allylamino-17-
demethoxygeldanamycin)± CHD-FA. Planktonic cells and pre-
formed bioﬁlms were treated with CHD-FA± geldanamycin
(12.5 μg/ml; Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) for 24 h at 37˚C.
Following incubation the metabolic activity of the cells was quan-
tiﬁed using the XTT reduction assay (Pierce et al., 2008). This assay
was carried out on two individual occasions, using two type and
two clinical strains tested in quadruplicate.

The role of extracellular matrix was investigated using strains
previously described with altered expression of FKS1 (Nett et al.,
2010a). Reference strain (DAY185), FKS1/fks1Δ and TDH3-FKS1
were standardized to 1× 106 cells/ml in 96-well ﬂat-bottomed
plates and bioﬁlms grown for 8 h at 37˚C. Bioﬁlms were carefully
washed three times with PBS and treated with 0.05 and 0.1% CHD-
FA for 24 h. After incubation, bioﬁlms were carefully washed three
times with PBS and metabolic activity was measured using the
XTT assay (Pierce et al., 2008). This assay was carried out on two
separate occasions, in triplicate.

Efﬂux pump activity of planktonic and bioﬁlm cells was initially
assessed using an MC-005,556 (Ala-Nap) ﬂuorescent assay (Ram-
age et al., 2011b). C. albicans SC5314 was prepared as standardized

planktonic cells (∼5× 107 cells/ml) in buffer solution [K2HPO4
(50 mM), MgSO4 (1 mM), and glucose (0.4%)] at pH 7.0. Plank-
tonic cells were treated with 0.0313 and 0.0625% CHD-FA for
4 and 24 h before being washed with PBS, resuspended in assay

buffer and added to black ﬂat-bottomed microtiter plate (Costar
3603, Corning, NY, USA). Bioﬁlms were grown directly within the
plates and treated with CHD-FA for 4 and 24 h. After incubation,
bioﬁlms were washed and the buffer solution added. The reaction
was initiated by the addition of Ala-Nap at a ﬁnal concentration
of 100 μg/ml. Fluorescence was quantiﬁed at 30 s intervals for 1 h
at 37˚C using a ﬂuorescence plate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA)
at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355/460 nm, respec-
tively. Higher ﬂuorescence values indicated low efﬂux activity and
vice versa. To determine whether efﬂux pump activity was detri-
mental to the effects of CHD-FA, an efﬂux pump inhibitor [EPI; l-
Phe-l-Arg-β-naphthylamide (MC-207,110), Sigma-Aldrich] was
prepared at a working concentration in distilled water (Ramage
et al., 2011b). To determine the effects of MC-207,110 on the
MIC of CHD-FA, a checkerboard titration assay was performed.
CHD-FA was tested at a range of 0.002–1% in combination with
MC-207,110 at a concentration of 64 μg/ml. Viability was assessed
using the XTT reduction assay as previously described (Pierce et al.,
2008).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data distribution and statistical analysis was performed using
GraphPad Prism (version 4; La Jolla, CA, USA). The non-
parametric data was analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test
to assess differences between two independent sample groups.
Statistical signiﬁcance was achieved if p < 0.05.

RESULTS
CHD-FA EXHIBITS POTENT ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY
All planktonic C. albicans isolates tested were susceptible to all four
antifungal drugs, with MIC90 for CHD-FA,VRZ, AMB, and CSP of
0.125% and 0.125 mg/l, respectively (Table 1). MIC50 and MIC90
refer to the MICs of ≥50/90% of isolates inhibited by each anti-
fungal, respectively. When the sessile activity of each compound
was compared to planktonic cells in terms of MIC90 fold change,
CHD-FA was the most effective (2×), followed by caspofungin
(4×), amphotericin B (64×) and voriconazole (>2048×). Both
planktonic and sessile cells showed comparable MIC’s for all 50
strains tested.

The bioﬁlm rate of kill of CHD-FA was assessed, where dose and
time dependent killing was observed (Figure 1Ai). Greater killing

was observed after 1, 2, and 4 h at 4× SMIC50 in comparison to
1 and 2× SMIC50 where a decrease in viability of 65 and 89%

was observed. After 24 h treatment no differences were observed
between each concentration, with an approximate ﬁnal 92% kill.

When each antifungal was compared at 4× SMIC50 then CHD-
FA displayed the quickest killing compared in ascending order to
AMB, VRZ and CSP, which after 2 h was 89, 61, 18, and −2%,
respectively (Figure 1Aii). However, after 24 h the most effective
compound was CSP (97%) followed by CHD-FA (91%), AMB
(88%), and VRZ (43%).

The ability to disrupt C. albicans bioﬁlms was then evaluated,
where it was shown that both 0.25% and 0.5% CHD-FA were
unable to signiﬁcantly reduce the bioﬁlm biomass compared to a
PBS control (p = 0.2318 and 0.1069, respectively; Figure 1B).
CHD-FA IS NON-SPECIFICALLY ACTIVE AGAINST CELL MEMBRANES
Deterioration of the general cell structure of both planktonic
and sessile cells was observed, of which the latter appear to be
crenated (Figure 2A). Based on these observations it was hypoth-
esized that the cell membrane may have been destabilized, so
membrane permeability assays were performed. ATP was released
in a time dependent manner, reaching a maximum after 40 min
exposure to CHD-FA (Figure 2B). These observations were con-
ﬁrmed through quantiﬁcation of PI, where uptake was shown to
be rapid over the ﬁrst 20 min, after which this plateaued. Using
time-lapse microscopy, uptake of PI was shown to occur rapidly
following addition of CHD-FA, with detectable membrane per-
meability within 10 min of exposure to CHD-FA, with all cells
becoming PI-positive and cell growth attenuated (Figures 2Ci,ii).
To further elucidate the mechanisms of action we investigated
the impact of chitin using its inhibitor nikkomycin (NKM). We
hypothesized that by weakening the chitin layer this would enable
CHD-FA to have greater activity, if indeed the cell membrane
was the target. C. albicans planktonic cells treated with 0.0625%
CHD-FA in the presence of NKM were found to be signiﬁcantly
more sensitive to CHD-FA (p = 0.0022) than NKM free cells
(Figure 2D), which is demonstrated by a 21% reduction in cell
viability. Treatment of C. albicans bioﬁlm showed a ∼34% reduc-
tion in cell viability, however, this was not statistically signiﬁcant
(p = 0.1057). In both planktonic and sessile states, NKM showed
no effect on cell viability (data not shown).

Novel antiseptic against Candida bioﬁlms

THE ROLE OF CANDIDA ALBICANS BIOFILM RESISTANCE
MECHANISMS
The roles of key resistance mechanisms utilized by C. albicans
were next investigated to determine whether they were likely to
impact the effectiveness of CHD-FA. C. albicans susceptibility
to 0.0625% CHD-FA (sub-MIC) in the presence of the Hsp90
inhibitor geldanamycin (GDM) was signiﬁcantly increased in
planktonic (p = 0.0009) and sessile (p = 0.0133) cells (Figure 3A),
reducing the cell viability by 49 and 7%, respectively. No signif-
icant differences were observed for both planktonic and sessile
cells treated at MIC levels (0.125%) in the presence of GDM. In
both cell states, GDM showed no effect on cell viability (data not
shown).

The role of FKS1 expression in C. albicans bioﬁlm resis-
tance was assessed. Figure 3B shows that FKS1/fks1Δ bioﬁlms
were signiﬁcantly more susceptible to CHD-FA at sub-MIC levels
(0.05%) compared to the treated reference strain (p = 0.0126),
with cell viability being reduced by 40%. In comparison, the
over-expressing strain, TDH3-FKS1, was less sensitive to 0.05%
CHD-FA, with cell survival 10% greater than the reference strain
(p = 0.3095).

Carbohydrate derived fulvic acid treated planktonic cells exhib-
ited a time and dose dependent up-regulation of efﬂux pumps
compared to untreated cells (Figure 3Ci). As the CHD-FA concen-
tration increased (0 to 0.0313 and 0.0625%) there was signiﬁcant
up-regulation of efﬂux pumps, indicated by low ﬂuorescence, after
treatment for 4 h (p = < 0.0001), but not after 24 h (p = 0.2581
and 0.0625, respectively). For sessile cells a general increase in
efﬂux pump activity was observed compared to planktonic cells.
However, no signiﬁcant increase in efﬂux pump activity was
reported when the bioﬁlms were exposed for 4 h to 0.0313 and
0.0625% CHD-FA (p = 0.3401 and 0.0503 respectively). Con-
versely, 24 h treated bioﬁlms showed a minor down-regulation
of efﬂux pumps compared to the untreated control at these con-
centrations (p = 0.0003 and 0.0019, respectively; Figure 3Cii). In
addition to efﬂux pump activity being measured, the effects of
an EPI on sensitivity were explored (Figure 3Ciii). There was no
signiﬁcant reduction in cell survival when 0.0625% CHD-FA and
EPI were used in combination (p = 0.0569), despite a 10% reduc-
tion in viability. EPI showed no effect on cell viability (data not
shown).

DISCUSSION
Many oral diseases are associated with microbial bioﬁlms, which
are generally refractory to prescription antibiotics and antifun-
gal agents. Recently we reported that commercial mouthwashes
were superior to these and a more favorable chemotherapeutic
option for treating oral candidal bioﬁlm infections (Ramage et al.,
2011a). However, even with chlorhexidine containing products
residual viable bioﬁlm cells are retained, so novel compounds are
still urgently required. Here we report for the ﬁrst time a potential
novel antimicrobial agent, CHD-FA, which has potent antifun-
gal activity against C. albicans bioﬁlms and other oral bioﬁlms.
Furthermore, we propose that this compound is effective through
disruption of the cellular membrane and is unaffected by bioﬁlm
resistance mechanisms.

of the bioﬁlm was then quantiﬁed by staining each bioﬁlm with 0.05% w/v
crystal violet solution. The bioﬁlms were washed, allowed to air dry, and
100% ethanol applied to destain each bioﬁlm. The biomass was quantiﬁed
spectrophotometrically by reading at 570 nm in a microtiter plate reader
(FLUOStar Omega, BMG Labtech). Forty isolates were tested during this
assay, which was performed in triplicate.

sterilization (0.22 μm) and supernatants adjusted to a pH of 7.8 in 10 mM

Initial studies aimed to evaluate the activity of CHD-FA and
the three major classes of antifungal agent, namely azoles, poly-
enes, and echinocandins, using a panel of clinical C. albicans

strains. This was primarily to assess the anti-bioﬁlm activity of
each drug compared to planktonic cells rather than direct anti-
fungal drug comparison. CHD-FA was shown to kill rapidly and

resuspended in assay buffer and 100 μg/ml of Ala-Nap added. These were
then transferred to a black 96-well plate for quantiﬁcation at 30 s intervals
over 60 min in a ﬂuorescent plate reader (Ex355/Em460). For bioﬁlms the
relative ﬂuorescence is presented, which is normalized to dry weight of
bioﬁlms (RFU/mg). High ﬂuorescence values indicate low efﬂux activity
and vice versa. C. albicans 24 h bioﬁlms were treated with 0.0625%
CHD-FA± EPI for 24 h (iii). Bioﬁlms were washed and metabolic activity
measured using the XTT metabolic assay with absorbance read at 492 nm.

be similarly effective against both planktonic and sessile cells
for all strains, whereas the existing antifungal agents exhibited

increased resistance in the bioﬁlm phenotype. This is in agree-

Novel antiseptic against Candida bioﬁlms

high level azole resistance and decreasing sensitivity of polyenes
and echinocandins (Kuhn et al., 2002).

Disruption of the bioﬁlm was also assessed, but despite CHD-
FA being highly fungicidal no signiﬁcant reduction of the bioﬁlm
biomass was observed. Nevertheless, given the effectiveness of this
compound then it would be possible to combine CHD-FA with a
known C. albicans bioﬁlm disrupting compound, such as lauroyl
glucose (Dusane et al., 2008). Lauroyl glucose is a sugar ester that
exhibits antimicrobial and emulsiﬁcation properties (Ferrer et al.,
2005), which contribute to the disruption of preformed C. albicans
bioﬁlms by up to 45% (Dusane et al., 2008). Therefore, these and
other novel bioﬁlm disruption agents could possibly be used to
augment the activity of CHD-FA.

The use of SEM demonstrated the appearance of crenated cells,
both planktonically and in bioﬁlms. Visually, these appear similar
to polyene treated cells, which integrates into and actively disrupts
cell membranes, lysing their cytoplasmic contents (Gale, 1963).
We therefore hypothesized that CHD-FA activity was potentially
based on interaction with the cell membrane; an idea supported
from the activity of CHD-FA against bacteria (van Rensburg et al.,
2000). Membrane permeabilization assays were therefore used to
conﬁrm our hypotheses.

The measurement of intracellular ATP release has been previ-
ously described as an appropriate method to measure membrane
permeability, as ATP leakage is not observed in viable cells (Smelt
et al., 1994). We showed ATP release occurred in a steady man-
ner with maximum release being observed after 40 min CHD-FA
exposure, with a slight reduction observed thereafter; a similar
phenomenon to a previous report (Smelt et al., 1994). PI uptake
was in agreement with ATP release, again showing a time depen-
dent disruption of the cell membrane. We demonstrated that C.
albicans membrane integrity is compromised rapidly after expo-
sure to CHD-FA, data supported visually from our ﬂuorescent
images showing PI uptake in as little as 1 min post-exposure
(Ahmad et al., 2011).

To further test our cell membrane hypothesis we weakened the
cell wall by inhibiting chitin biosynthesis using the chitin syn-
thase inhibitor NKZ, which has been shown to inhibit all three
Chs isozymes in C. albicans, and in turn results in a lack of chitin
in fungal cells (Kim et al., 2002). We reasoned that if the mem-
brane were the active target then the weakened cell would become
hyper-susceptible to CHD-FA. We demonstrated that NKZ in
combination with CHD-FA made both planktonic and sessile
cells more susceptible to CHD-FA, which is similar to previous
work showing that NKZ in combination with azoles increased C.
albicans bioﬁlm susceptibility (Kaneko et al., 2010).

Our group, amongst others, have shown the importance of
bioﬁlms in antimicrobial resistance, a multifactorial process (Ram-
age et al., 2009). We therefore aimed to evaluate the potential effects
of key bioﬁlm resistance mechanisms on CHD-FA. The major reg-
ulator of stress in C. albicans is Hsp90, which has been shown to
potentiate the emergence and maintenance of resistance to azoles
and echinocandins in C. albicans bioﬁlms, at least in part via cal-
cineurin (Robbins et al., 2011). Our study has also shown that
Hsp90 plays a role in stress induced resistance, as planktonic and
sessile C. albicans cells were more susceptible to CHD-FA at a
sub-MIC level when geldanamycin, the Hsp90 inhibitor, is used

in combination. Therefore, stress induced resistance mechanisms
appear to play a role in C. albicans response to CHD-FA, however,
this is more apparent in planktonic cells.

We next investigated the role of bioﬁlm ECM, a key compo-
nent and deﬁning characteristic of fungal bioﬁlms (Baillie and
Douglas, 2000). Recent work by the Andes group has shown
that ECM β-1,3 glucan, synthesized from Fks1p, is responsible
for sequestering antifungal drugs and acting as a “drug sponge”
(Nett et al., 2010a,b), therefore conferring resistance on C. albi-
cans bioﬁlms. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether CHD-FA
was sequestered by ECM β-1,3 glucan in the same way as other
classes of antifungal agents. For this we utilized strains used in the
previous investigations (Nett et al., 2010b), where it was shown
that FKS1/fks1Δ bioﬁlm sensitivity to ﬂuconazole was exquisite
in comparison to the bioﬁlm resistant parental strain and the
ECM β-1,3 glucan over-expressing strain TDH3-FKS1, which were
highly resistant to ﬂuconazole. In our investigations we have shown
the FKS1/fks1Δ, TDH3-FKS1 and the reference strain, DAY185,
were equally sensitive at 1× MIC50 to CHD-FA. This is surpris-

ing given that Nett et al. (2010a) have shown that ECM impacts
other antifungal classes. This suggests in our study that ECM β-1,3
glucan does not sequester CHD-FA, unlike azoles, polyenes, and
echinocandins (Nett et al., 2010a).

Finally, we investigated whether efﬂux pumps are affected by
CHD-FA, as these have previously been shown to be expressed
in C. albicans bioﬁlms (Ramage et al., 2002). In this study we
showed efﬂux pump activity in both planktonic and sessile C. albi-
cans cells, but only signiﬁcant up-regulation after 4 h treatment in
planktonic cells at sub-MIC levels of CHD-FA. However, overall
efﬂux pump activity in C. albicans bioﬁlms was found to be higher
when compared to planktonic cells, which was predicted based on
previous literature (Ramage et al., 2002). In order to determine
their contribution to potential resistance to CHD-FA we inhibited
efﬂux pump activity using a competitive substrate. Efﬂux pump
inhibitor studies have previously shown, with the use of mutants
with single and double deletion mutations, that C. albicans have
reduced mRNA expression for various multidrug resistant efﬂux
pumps (Ramage et al., 2002). Here we showed that this compound
did not alter the MIC. These data indicates that CHD-FA is not
impacted by efﬂux pump activity, despite the fact that these pumps
were induced through treatment. This is unsurprising given that
CHD-FA acts on the cell membrane and not through an internal
cellular mechanism.

CHD-FA is a microbicidal compound that acts non-speciﬁcally
on the cell membrane. Therefore, it may serve as a potential
novel antiseptic agent for the treatment of oral candidosis and
other candidal bioﬁlm infections. Increasingly Candida bioﬁlms
are becoming clinically important (Tumbarello et al., 2007; Ram-
age et al., 2009), particularly because of inappropriate or misuse of
broad spectrum antimicrobials that are ineffective against recal-
citrant bioﬁlms (Niimi et al., 2010). In the context of oral health,
individuals suffer from a range of oral candidal diseases that cause
high levels of morbidity. Moreover, there are many other oral dis-
eases of microbial bioﬁlm origin, such as caries and periodontitis,
which would beneﬁt from novel antiseptic molecules, assuming
these meet appropriate safety standards. CHD-FA has already
shown to have no sign of toxicity in rats and humans, and in

fact was reported to have anti-inﬂammatory and wound healing
properties, possibly through a free radical scavenging mechanism
(Gandy et al., 2011; Sabi et al., 2011). Whilst CHD-FA appears
to have appropriate biological properties of an antiseptic, further
cellular and in vivo studies are required.
