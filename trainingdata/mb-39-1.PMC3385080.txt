Isolates  of  Ophiocordyceps  heteropoda  (Kobayasi)  collected  from  Mt.  Halla  on  Jeju-do,  Korea  were  tested  for  mycelial  growth
on  different  agar  media  and  in  the  presence  of  different  carbon  and  nitrogen  sources.  Similarly,  isolates  were  also  incubated
at  different  temperatures  as  well  as  under  continuous  light  and  dark  conditions.  Growth  was  better  on  Hamada  agar,  basal
medium,  and  malt-yeast  agar,  but  poor  on  Czapek-Dox  agar.  Different  carbon  sources  such  as  dextrin,  saccharose,  starch,
lactose,  maltose,  fructose,  and  dextrose  resulted  in  better  growth.  Complex  organic  nitrogen  sources  such  as  yeast  extract
and  peptone  revealed  the  most  effective  growth.  Mycelial  growth  was  best  at  25oC.  The  growth  rate  was  faster  in  the  dark
than  the  light,  but  mycelial  density  was  less  compact  in  the  dark.

Ophiocordyceps  heteropoda  is  a  relatively  rare  species  that
was  first  described  by  Kobayasi  as  Cordyceps  heteropoda
from north Japan, growing on hypogaeous cicada nymphs
(Figs.  1  and  2)  [1].  It  was  then  reported  from  the  Congo,
a  central  African  country  [2].  Besides  Japan,  it  has  been
recently  reported  from  other  east  Asian  countries  such  as
Korea  and  China  [3-5].  C.  heteropoda  var.  haiirooosemi-
take, and  two form  species, C. heteropoda  f. sp.  tsutsuna-
gaoosemitake  and  C.  heteropoda  f.  sp.  Usuirooosemitake,
were  also  reported  by  Shimizu  [6].  A  different  variety,  C.
heteropoda  var.  langyashanensis,  and  its  anamorph,  Hir-
sutella  heteropoda,  have  been  reported  recently  from
China  [4].  Korean  C.  heteropoda  is  more  similar  to  the
Japanese  species  [1, 3].  This  species  has  a  very  patchy  dis-
tribution,  as  it  has  been  reported  only  from  east  Asia  and
central  Africa,  probably  due  to  a  lack  of  exploration.  C.
heteropoda was previously confused with another Cordyceps
species,  C.  scottianus  [1, 7, 8].  Cordyceps  species  growing
on  cicadas,  including  C.  heteropoda,  have  been  explicitly
described, beautifully illustrated, and well reviewed in dif-
ferent  pictorial  books  [1, 3, 5, 6, 8-11].  Recently,  C.  het-
eropoda was transferred to Ophiocordyceps by Sung et al.
[12],  hence,  it  was  renamed  O.  heteropoda  (Kobayasi)
Sung  et  al.  [12].  This  species  is  particularly  characterized
by  the  epigaeous  part  of  its  stem,  which  is  distinct  from
the  hypogaeous  part.  The  head  is  oval  to  spherical  and  is
quite distinct from the stem.

This  fungus  produces  anti-bacterial  and  anti-fungal  com-
pounds [13]. In the context of growing studies on Cordyceps

and  allied  species  [14-23],  isolates  of  this  species  were
tested for growth on different agar media, at different tem-
peratures, and under light and dark conditions. This species
showed moderate growth on agar media with the possibil-
ity  of  growing  to  a  larger  scale  under  optimum  cultural
conditions and nutrition sources.

Materials  and  Methods

Fungal  isolates. Multi-ascospore  isolates  of  O.  heteropoda
specimens  CRI  C-11247,  CRI  C-12565,  and  CRI  C-
12567,  which  were  preserved  at  the  Cordyceps  Research
Institute  (CRI),  Mushtech,  Korea,  were  used.  The  isolates
were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar plus yeast extract
(SDAY;  dextrose  40 g,  yeast  extract  10 g,  peptone  10 g,
and agar 20 g per 1,000 mL; pH 5.6) plates at 25oC for 30
days  and  were  used  for  further  experiments.  Specimen
CRI  C-11247  was  collected  on  May  21,  2004.  Similarly,
two  other  specimens,  CRI  C-12565  and  CRI  C-12567,
were collected on May 20, 2005. All specimens were col-
lected from Mt. Halla on Jeju-do.

Effect  of  medium  on  O.  heteropoda  mycelial  growth.
Ten  different  types  of  agar  media,  including  malt-extract
agar,  oatmeal  agar  (OA),  malt-yeast  agar  (MYA),  Mar-
tin’s peptone dextrose agar (MPDA), basal medium (BM),
potato  dextrose  agar  (PDA),  Schizophyllum  (mushroom)
genetics  complete  medium  plus  yeast  extract  (MCM),
Hamada  agar (HA),  Czapek-Dox  agar  (CDA), and  SDAY
were  used  to  observe  the  effect  of  medium  on  O.  het-
eropoda mycelial growth (Table 1). Agar was added to all

experimental  agar  plates.  The  agar  plates  were  then  incu-

Different  carbon  and  nitrogen  sources  were  tested  for
their  effect on O. heteropoda  mycelial  growth. Ten differ-
ent  carbon  sources,  including  arabinose,  dextrin,  dextrose,

nium  tartrate,  KNO3,  arginine,  asparagine,  glycine,  peptone,
and  yeast  extract  were  individually  added  to  WA  at  a  1%
concentration  (w/v).  The  isolates  were  inoculated  on  WA
plates  supplemented  with  carbon  and  nitrogen  sources  and
incubated  at  25oC  for  30  days  under  white  fluorescent
light.  CD  was  measured  in  mm  and  MD  was  qualitatively
categorized as thin (+), moderate (++), or compact (+++).

compact  to  moderate  MD  on  all  media,  except  CDA  in
which  a  thin  MD  was  produced  (Table  2).  CDA  also
resulted in the shortest CD. The major difference between
CDA  and  other  media  is  that  the  former  does  not  contain
any  organic  nitrogen  source.  OA  and  PDA  also  do  not
contain  an  extra  organic  nitrogen  source,  but  oatmeal  and
potato  are  complex  organic  substances  that  contain  organic
nitrogen sources. However, all remaining media were sup-
plemented with either peptone, yeast extract, or both. From

this  observation,  it  can  be  concluded  that  organic  nitro-
gen  sources  are  the  most  important  factor  for  rich  myce-
lial growth in O. heteropoda. Besides CDA, OA produced
shorter CD as well as a moderate MD.

Dextrin,  saccharose,  starch,  lactose,  maltose,  fructose,
and  dextrose  resulted  in  better  growth  than  the  remaining
carbon sources both in terms of CD and MD (Table 3). In
general,  dextrin,  saccharose,  and  starch  were  more  favor-
able  carbon  sources.  The  results  showed  that  carbon
sources alone could not sustain growth when compared to
growth  on  complete  media  (Tables  2  and  3).  However,  it
was  unclear  why  CDA  performed  worse  than  the  simple
carbon  sources  despite  being  supplemented  with  inor-
ganic nitrogen sources and mineral salts.

Complex  organic  nitrogen  sources  resulted  in  better
growth than inorganic nitrogen sources (Table 4). Further-
more,  complex  organic  nitrogen  sources,  such  as  yeast

extract  and  peptone,  performed  better  than  amino  acids
(Table  4),  as  shown  by  previous  studies  [24, 25].  The
mycelial  growth  patterns  revealed  that  only  yeast  extract
and  peptone  resulted  in  a  compact  MD.  It  was  obvious
that  yeast  extract  and  peptone  consisted  of  many  types  of
amino acids and, hence, resulted in better growth than that
provided  by  individual  amino  acids.  Among  the  amino
acids tested, asparagine was the best and resulted in growth
similar  to  ammonium  tartrate  and  NH4NO3.  (NH4)2SO4
showed  the  best  growth  among  the  inorganic  nitrogen
sources  and  performed  better  than  any  of  the  individual
amino acids (Table 4). NH4NO3 and KNO3 also resulted in
better  mycelial  growth  than  glycine  and  arginine  both  in
terms  of  CD  and  MD  (Table  4).  Glycine,  arginine,  and
(NH4)3PO4 all produced a thin MD.

The  effect  of  temperature  on  O.  heteropoda  mycelial
growth  differed  from  medium  to  medium.  All  isolates
showed  their  longest  CD  at  25oC  on  PDA,  followed  by
20oC,  30oC  and  15oC  (Fig.  3).  Similar  to  PDA,  the  long-
est  CD  was  observed  at  25oC  on  both  MCM  and  BM,
whereas the least growth was observed at 30oC (Figs. 3, 4
and  5).  In  general,  mycelial  growth  occurred  at  all  the

sity  in  the  dark.  This  result  was  very  similar  to  that  of
Shrestha  et  al.  [24].  Isolates  of  O.  heteropoda  produced
yellowish white to yellow colonies with reddish pigmenta-
tion  on  the  medium,  as  shown  by  Li  et  al.  [4].  However,
the  growth  rate  was  faster  in  this  study  than  that  of  Li  et
al. [4]. But, the growth rate of  O. heteropoda was slower,
than  that  of  C.  militaris  and  Metacordyceps  yongmunen-
sis [24, 25].
