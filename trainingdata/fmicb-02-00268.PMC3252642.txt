Ultramaﬁc rocks in the Earth’s mantle represent a tremendous reservoir of carbon and
reducing power. Upon tectonic uplift and exposure to ﬂuid ﬂow, serpentinization of these
materials generates copious energy, sustains abiogenic synthesis of organic molecules,
and releases hydrogen gas (H2). In order to assess the potential for microbial H2 uti-
lization fueled by serpentinization, we conducted metagenomic surveys of a marine
serpentinite-hosted hydrothermal chimney (at the Lost City hydrothermal ﬁeld) and two
continental serpentinite-hosted alkaline seeps (at theTablelands Ophiolite, Newfoundland).
Novel [NiFe]-hydrogenase sequences were identiﬁed at both the marine and continental
sites, and in both cases, phylogenetic analyses indicated aerobic, potentially autotrophic
Betaproteobacteria belonging to order Burkholderiales as the most likely H2-oxidizers.
Both sites also yielded metagenomic evidence for microbial H2 production catalyzed by
[FeFe]-hydrogenases in anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria belonging to order Clostridiales.
In addition, we present metagenomic evidence at both sites for aerobic carbon monoxide
utilization and anaerobic carbon ﬁxation via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway. In general, our
results point to H2-oxidizing Betaproteobacteria thriving in shallow, oxic–anoxic transition
zones and the anaerobic Clostridia thriving in anoxic, deep subsurface habitats. These data
demonstrate the feasibility of metagenomic investigations into novel subsurface habitats
via surface-exposed seeps and indicate the potential for H2-powered primary production
in serpentinite-hosted subsurface habitats.

INTRODUCTION
The potentially vast microbial diversity and biomass of the subsur-
face biosphere (Whitman et al., 1998) has been frequently noted
(Biddle et al., 2006; Huber et al., 2007; Santelli et al., 2008; Schrenk
et al., 2010), but there is very little evidence to indicate how much
of it is supported by new primary production or by recycling
of buried organic carbon. Earth’s mantle is primarily composed
of ultramaﬁc rocks that undergo a geochemical process known
as serpentinization when they are tectonically uplifted into the
crust and exposed to water. Serpentinization is highly exother-
mic and can release large quantities of hydrogen gas (H2) and
variable amounts of methane and low-molecular weight organic
compounds (McCollom and Seewald, 2007; Proskurowski et al.,
2008). Therefore, serpentinization is a potential source of reducing
power and organic carbon for organisms inhabiting the ultramaﬁc
subsurface. Actively serpentinizing rocks are present on all of the
world’s continents and comprise signiﬁcant portions of the deep
seaﬂoor, and yet they are some of the most poorly understood
portions of the biosphere.

The most dramatic example of an ecosystem supported by
serpentinization is the Lost City hydrothermal ﬁeld, which is sit-
uated on a serpentinite-rich massif 15 km from the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge. Carbonate chimneys at Lost City vent warm (up to 90˚C),
pH 9–11 ﬂuids rich in calcium, H2 (up to 14 mmol/kg), and
methane (1–2 mmol/kg; Kelley et al., 2005). Methane and larger

hydrocarbon chains with up to four carbon atoms in Lost City
ﬂuids show evidence of an abiogenic origin in the deep subsurface
(Proskurowski et al., 2008), but the amount of microbial activ-
ity supported by this abiotic source of organics has not been
quantiﬁed. The anoxic interiors of Lost City carbonate chim-
neys are dominated by Methanosarcinales-related archaea poten-
tially involved in methane production and oxidation (Schrenk
et al., 2004; Brazelton et al., 2011). The oxic chimney exteriors
are dominated by aerobic methane- and sulfur-oxidizing bacte-
ria (Brazelton et al., 2006, 2010). The role of H2-metabolizing
bacteria in Lost City chimneys, though, has not been explicitly
investigated.

In addition to marine hydrothermal systems such as Lost City,
Ophiolites abducted onto continents also provide a potential win-
dow into subsurface habitats supported by serpentinization. The
Tablelands Ophiolite in western Newfoundland, Canada features
extensive ultramaﬁc exposures including serpentinites associated
with the seepage of highly reducing, pH 12 ﬂuids, and extensive
calcium carbonate (travertine) deposits. The Tablelands ﬂuids are
enriched in calcium, H2 (up to ∼500 μM), and methane (Szponar
et al., submitted). The geochemical similarities between the alka-
line springs at the Tablelands and the vent ﬂuids at Lost City
strongly suggest that they are the surface expressions of ongoing
serpentinization-associated reactions occurring in the underlying
ultramaﬁc subsurface.

In order to identify potential inhabitants of the ultramaﬁc sub-
surface in both marine and continental settings, we conducted
a metagenomic survey of two Tablelands alkaline springs as a
comparison to a previously published metagenome from a Lost
City chimney (Brazelton and Baross, 2009, 2010). In this report,
we focus on the potential for H2-fueled microbial activity by
investigating the incidence and diversity of sequences encoding
hydrogenase enzymes. Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible con-
version between molecular hydrogen and its component protons
. This reaction is catalyzed by two
main classes of hydrogenase: [NiFe]-hydrogenases are required
for uptake and oxidation of H2, while [FeFe]-hydrogenases are
typically involved in microbial H2 production. Although the
two classes share some sequence similarity, they do not appear
to be monophyletic (Vignais et al., 2001; Vignais and Billoud,
2007). Therefore, phylogenetic analyses of possible hydrogenase-
encoding sequences should reliably indicate a genetic potential
for H2 oxidation or H2 production. The results presented here
indicate that both types of hydrogenase are abundant in the Table-
lands and Lost City metagenomes and that the identity of the
H2-metabolizing organisms at both sites are intriguingly similar.
Additional metagenomic evidence also indicates the potential for
carbon ﬁxation pathways involving carbon monoxide utilization
or acetogenesis by H2-metabolizing organisms. In general, this
initial metagenomic survey highlights the potential for H2-fueled
primary production in the ultramaﬁc subsurface.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
LOST CITY METAGENOME
The Lost City metagenomic dataset included in this analysis was
previously described in Brazelton and Baross (2009, 2010). In sum-
mary, a ∼1 kg carbonate chimney sample (H03_072705_R0424)
was collected from the central“Poseidon”ediﬁce (Figure 1A) of the
Lost City hydrothermal ﬁeld on 27 July 2005 by the DSV Hercules
during the 2005 Lost City expedition aboard the R/V Ronald H.

FIGURE 1 | Photographs of the Lost City (A) and Tablelands (B) sites
where metagenome samples were collected. The Lost City metagenome
sample was grabbed by the manipulator on the ROV Hercules, comprising
approximately 1 kg of carbonate minerals and associated bioﬁlm material (A
inset) from the Poseidon pinnacle (A) at the Lost City hydrothermal ﬁeld.
The WHC2b metagenome sample was collected by ﬁltering 10 L of ﬂuid
from a pH 12 pool approximately 2.5 m long, 1 m wide, and less than 1 m
deep (B). Fluid was collected by gentle suction from a depression in the
bottom of the pool underneath a ledge [arrow in (B)], which appeared to be
a source of the spring ﬂuid. Travertine (carbonate) deposits are visible
around the edge of the pool. Lost City photo credit: Deborah Kelley, U. of

Brown. The ﬂuids venting from this chimney can reach 88˚C, pH
10.7, and are highly enriched in H2 (13 mmol/kg) and methane
(1.5 mmol/kg; Proskurowski et al., 2008). DNA extraction and
puriﬁcation is described in Brazelton and Baross (2010). Shotgun
library construction and Sanger end-sequencing of pUC18 inserts
were conducted according to standard protocols at the DOE Joint
Genome Institute in 2007. Two libraries were constructed from
two subsamples of the same carbonate chimney sample. Reads
from both libraries were combined for assembly and for analy-
ses described here. Mean read length for the 46,360 reads from
both libraries was 755 bp, and the mean length of all 6324 contigs
was 1583 bp, with a maximum of 24 kb. All sequencing reads and
assembled contigs are publicly available on the MG-RAST (Meyer
et al., 2008) server under project name “Lost City hydrother-
mal ﬁeld” and MG-RAST IDs 4461585.3 (reads) and 4470602.3
(contigs).

COLLECTION OF TABLELANDS SAMPLES
Two springs ∼2 km apart were sampled for this study. A ﬂuid sam-
ple from the WHC2b spring was collected from the bottom of a
pH 12 pool (∼1 m deep) surrounded by travertine (carbonate)
deposits in Winter House Canyon on 25 August 2010. The sam-
pling tubing inlet was placed at the highest pH (12.06) and lowest

Eh (−733 mV) location detected at the time of sampling, which

was a depression at the bottom edge of the pool (Figure 1B).
The pool depth is less than 1 m, so the pool represents a very
strong redox gradient from the surface (which is in contact with
the atmosphere) to the anoxic bottom. At the time of sampling,
the measured H2 concentration was ∼0.24 mmol/kg, and a max-
imum of 0.52 mmol/kg was measured at the same location one
year later (Szponar et al., submitted). These concentrations are
much lower than that of the astonishingly H2-rich Lost City ﬂu-
ids, but are nevertheless indicative of signiﬁcant H2 enrichment
over background surface waters. The surface temperature of the
pool is determined by the air temperature, and the bottom of the
pool is typically 1–4˚C cooler than the surface. The pH and Eh of
ﬂuid ﬂowing through the tube was monitored during sampling to
verify that ambient ﬂuid with more neutral pH or more oxidizing
Eh did not dilute the sample. Approximately 10 L of ﬂuid was col-
lected from WHC2b by repeated pulls with a 60 mL sterile syringe
and stored in sterile bottles until ﬁltration through four replicate
0.2 μm Sterivex (Millipore) ﬁlter cartridges. Sterivex ﬁlters were
immediately frozen in liquid N2, transported on dry ice, and stored
at –80˚C until DNA extraction.

A ﬂuid sample was collected from a spring (called TLE) asso-
ciated with a large travertine deposit on the northeastern face of
Table Mountain on 17 June 2010. The spring ﬂuid was visibly
mixing with surface runoff, as evidenced by the lower pH and

higher Eh compared to WHC2b: pH 10.5 and Eh + 25 mV. No H2

was detected at the time of sampling, but concentrations of 65
and 180 μM have been measured at this location by prior sam-
pling efforts (Szponar et al., submitted). The temperature of the
spring was not measured at the time of sampling, but subsequent
measurements have shown that it is typically much cooler than air
temperature (∼9˚C with air temperature of ∼20˚C) due to its sub-
surface source and/or its mixing with runoff from snowmelt. The
spring was sampled by repeated pulls with a 60 mL sterile syringe

for a total of 1.2 L stored in sterile bottles. Filtration, transporta-
tion, and storage of the TLE sample was conducted as described
above for the WHC2b sample.

DNA EXTRACTION AND SEQUENCING OF TABLELANDS SAMPLES
DNA extraction from Sterivex ﬁlters was conducted according to
the protocol described by Huber et al. (2002) and Sogin et al.
(2006). The DNA yield from the TLE sample was insufﬁcient for
metagenomic sequencing, so a minimal amount of whole genome
ampliﬁcation (WGA) was conducted according to the following
protocol. RepliG (Qiagen) WGA reactions were incubated for only
3 h according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by inac-
tivation of the enzyme at 65˚C for 3 min. Four replicate RepliG
WGA reactions were pooled, and ampliﬁcation products were
puriﬁed with QiAamp (Qiagen) columns, treated with S1 Nuclease
at 37˚C for 1hr, puriﬁed with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol,
and ﬁnally precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate. TRFLP
proﬁles of 16S rRNA amplicons from TLE pre- and post-WGA
were nearly identical (86% Sorensen similarity; 75% Jaccard sim-
ilarity, calculated with EstimateS1 after clustering peaks according
to the method of (Abdo et al., 2006). Differences between pre-
and post-WGA TRFLP proﬁles involved the loss of a few minor
peaks and moderate increase in the size of major peaks in the
post-WGA proﬁles. Therefore, WGA may have limited the diver-
sity of rare sequences in the TLE metagenomic dataset, but we do
not expect any taxonomic bias in the most abundant sequences.
Approximately 1 μg of DNA from each sample was submitted to
the Engencore facility (University of South Carolina) for shotgun
metagenomic pyrosequencing on a Roche Titanium sequencer.

METAGENOMIC ANALYSIS AND ASSEMBLY
Low-quality ends of sequencing reads were trimmed in Geneious
(Biomatters Ltd.) with default parameters, and reads were derepli-
cated with the server2 described by Gomez-Alvarez et al. (2009).
Dereplicated reads (80,830 reads from 118,348 original reads for
WHC2b; 56,965 reads from 135,538 original reads for TLE) were
used for de novo metagenomic assembly in Geneious with default
parameters for “medium sensitivity.” Taxonomic classiﬁcation of
WHC2b contigs > 2 kb was conducted with the TaxSom server
(Weber et al., 2010) with a pre-calculated model for all Archaea
and Bacteria. Automated annotation of open reading frames in
contig WHC2b.C1 was performed by the RAST server (Aziz et al.,
2008). All sequencing reads and assembled contigs for both sam-
ples are available on the MG-RAST (Meyer et al., 2008) server
under project name “Serpentinite springs” and MG-RAST IDs
4460689.3, 4460690.3, 4461618.3, and 4461619.3. Furthermore,
MIMS-compliant metadata are provided in Table A1 in Appendix.

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES
Hydrogenase sequences were detected in metagenomic datasets by
TBLASTN (Altschul et al., 1997) using as query a ﬁle of PFAM
(Finn et al., 2008) seed sequences for the large subunits of [FeFe]-
hydrogenase (PF02906) or [NiFe]-hydrogenase (PF00374). For

comparative purposes, we included in this tblastn search addi-
tional metagenomic datasets that are publicly available in the
MG-RAST (Meyer et al., 2008) and DOE Joint Genome Insti-
tute IMG/M (Markowitz et al., 2006) databases. For metagenomic
−5, the aligned regions
reads with tblastn E-values better than 10
were translated and included in further phylogenetic analyses. All
phylogenetic trees involving metagenomic sequences (Figures 3
and 5–7; Figures A1 and A2 in Appendix) were constructed with
a multi-step approach utilizing reference alignments and trees in
order to minimize errors and biases introduced by the fragmentary
and non-overlapping nature of the metagenomic sequences. For
each tree, a multiple sequence alignment was constructed with
ClustalX (Larkin et al., 2007) using sequences from the studies
by (Vignais et al., 2001; Boyd et al., 2009, 2010) and additional
close relatives found in GenBank by blastx. Unaligned metage-
nomic fragments were added to the reference alignment proﬁle
with ClustalX in order to avoid alteration of the relative posi-
tions of residues in the reference alignment. Next, a bootstrapped
maximum-likelihood tree was constructed from the reference-
only alignment using the “-f a” algorithm in RAxML version
7.0.3 (Stamatakis, 2006). The reference-only tree with the highest-
likelihood was used as a constraint tree (“-r” ﬂag in RAxML) for
100 inferences from the full alignment (including metagenomic
fragments) by RAxML, and bootstrap support values were drawn
on the highest-likelihood tree. CODH and ACS trees were con-
structed using the same method; CODH reference sequences were
obtained from (Cunliffe et al., 2008), and ACS reference sequences
were obtained from (Gagen et al., 2010). The closest relatives to
the 16S rRNA sequences were identiﬁed with the aid of the SILVA
aligner and database (Pruesse et al., 2007) visualized in ARB (Lud-
wig et al., 2004). The alignment was exported from ARB, re-aligned
with MUSCLE version 3.6 (Edgar, 2004), manually corrected, and
built into a bootstrapped maximum-likelihood tree with RaxML.

RESULTS
TAXONOMIC ANALYSIS OF METAGENOMIC ASSEMBLIES
A previous study (Brazelton and Baross, 2010) demonstrated that
almost all of the large contigs assembled from Lost City chim-
ney shotgun metagenomic sequences contain open reading frames
with signiﬁcant sequence similarity to at least one protein encoded
by the genome of Thiomicrospira crunogena XCL-2, indicating that
Thiomicrospira-related organisms dominated the metagenomic
assembly.

Figure 2 displays the %GC and length of the 907 contigs with
length > 2 kb obtained from the assembly of WHC2b shotgun
metagenomic sequencing reads. Despite relatively low sequenc-
ing effort, de novo assembly yielded moderately large contigs
and revealed a few dominant populations, highlighting the low
diversity of the spring ﬂuid. Most of the largest contigs were tax-
onomically classiﬁed by the TaxSOM server (Weber et al., 2010)
as members of the Comamonadaceae family within order Burk-
holderiales (Figure 2). A secondary assemblage of low %GC Fir-
micutes contigs (orders Bacillales and Clostridiales) is also evident
in WHC2b (Figure 2).

The de novo metagenomic assembly from TLE yielded only 118
contigs > 2 kb, and the longest was just 8.5 kb (data not shown).
Most of the same taxonomic groups in WHC2b are also present in

the Burkholderiales do not dominate the assembly as they do in
WHC2b.

A partial 16S rRNA sequence was identiﬁed in one of the Burk-
holderiales contigs in each Tablelands ﬂuid sample (WHC2b.C991:
1.6 kb, 56% GC, 3.6 mean coverage; TLE.C712: 1.5 kb, 54% GC,
1.3 mean coverage). Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis
placed both sequences in genus Hydrogenophaga (Figure 3), which
is consistent with the phylogeny of the hydrogenases discussed
below. Two Burkholderiales-related 16S rRNA gene clones were
also recovered from the same Lost City carbonate structure that
is the source of the metagenome discussed here; these clones were
previously described in Brazelton et al. (2006). They are 99% simi-
lar over 1471 bp (calculated with MatGat; Campanella et al., 2003)
to the 16S rRNA sequence of Ralstonia pickettii, an oligotroph
known to grow in moist bioﬁlms (Stelzmueller et al., 2006). The
16S rRNA sequence of R. eutropha (the hydrogenases of which are
discussed below) is 96% similar to the Lost City clones (Figure 3).
The largest WHC2b contig (WHC2b.C1: 37 kb, 67% GC, com-
prising 615 shotgun reads at 6.6 mean coverage) contains putative
operons for a [NiFe]-hydrogenase, carbon monoxide dehydro-
genase (CODH), and Rubisco (Figure 4). The Rubisco cluster
includes RAST annotations for the small and large subunits of
Rubisco, six carboxysome shell proteins, and two Rubisco activa-
tion proteins. The hydrogenase cluster includes RAST annotations
for the small and large subunits of uptake [NiFe]-hydrogenase, a
signal transduction histidine kinase (HoxJ), and a transcriptional
regulatory protein (HoxA). The CODH cluster is at the edge of
the contig and is most likely incomplete. It includes RAST annota-
tions for the three subunits of CODH (CoxMSL) with an upstream
CoxC and a downstream CoxD. This arrangement is consistent

that this contig represents a plasmid. Indeed, the H2 oxidation and
carbon ﬁxation capabilities of Ralstonia eutropha are encoded in a
“megaplasmid,” and loss of this plasmid would result in a strictly
heterotrophic lifestyle (Schwartz et al., 2009). The plasmid par-
titioning protein in WHC2b.C1 does not contain any homologs
in the R. eutropha megaplasmid, however, and the contig is not a
complete plasmid sequence, so we cannot conclude with certainty
whether it is a plasmid. Nevertheless, all sequenced members of
the Burkholderiaceae family contain multiple replicons; the addi-
tional genetic molecules other than the main chromosome are
sometimes called “chromosomes” and sometimes “megaplasmids”
(Fricke et al., 2009). No genomes from Hydrogenophaga species
(Comamonadaceae family) have been sequenced yet, and we are
not aware of any data pertaining to whether their hydrogenases
are plasmid-encoded.

ABUNDANCE OF SEQUENCES ENCODING HYDROGENASES
We investigated the genetic potential for communities in these
samples to metabolize H2 by conducting a tblastn search for
potential homologs of the catalytic (large) subunits of [FeFe]-
hydrogenase and [NiFe]-hydrogenase. For each metagenome, the
number of unique sequencing reads that match at least one
hydrogenase is reported in Table 1. For comparative purposes,
only unassembled sequences were included in the quantiﬁca-
tion of hydrogenase abundance because quantitative comparisons
of gene abundance among assembled metagenomes is problem-
atic due to their varying assembly strategies and sequencing
coverages.

The Lost City chimney metagenome and the Tablelands
metagenome WHC2b both contained a similar proportion
of putative hydrogenase sequences as those found in other
metagenomes from environments where H2 metabolism is

expected to occur (Table 1). These environments (including
methanotrophic sediments, hot springs, marine hydrothermal
vents, organic degradation bioreactors, acid mine drainage, and
a hypersaline microbial mat) contained >10× greater density of
hydrogenases than the combined dataset from the Global Ocean
Sampling expedition. Remarkably, zero hydrogenase sequences
were detected in the metagenomic data from the TLE spring, which
exhibited more moderate pH and Eh values compared to WHC2b.
The Lost City metagenome was exceptionally rich in sequences
matching [NiFe]-hydrogenases; only two metagenomes in the
MG-RAST and IMG/M databases contained a higher proportion
(Table 1). The WHC2b metagenome, in contrast, was excep-
tionally rich in sequences matching [FeFe]-hydrogenases, which
are typically involved in H2 production during fermentation.
Indeed, the only metagenomes with a higher proportion of [FeFe]-
hydrogenases than WHC2b are derived from cellulose-degrading
fermentation bioreactors.

Inferring the abundance of H2-oxidizing or H2-producing
organisms from the abundance of hydrogenases genes is prob-
lematic because multiple hydrogenases are frequently present
in a given genome (Vignais and Billoud, 2007). Furthermore,
our tblastn search could have detected hydrogenases found
in all three domains of life. Phylogenetic analyses, however,
can constrain the taxonomic possibilities for each hydrogenase
sequence and therefore enable one to test hypotheses about
which hydrogenases are encoded by which organisms. The phy-
logenetic analyses described below indicate that both the Table-
lands and Lost City springs feature [NiFe]-hydrogenases primarily
encoded by Betaproteobacteria related to known H2-oxidizers and
[FeFe]-hydrogenases encoded by Clostridia-related to known H2-
producers. No archaeal or eukaryotic hydrogenases were detected
in this study.

with the phylogeny reported by Vignais et al. (2001) and Vignais and

[NiFe]-HYDROGENASE DIVERSITY
In order to further characterize the putative hydrogenase
sequences identiﬁed in the tblastn search, we constructed
maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees (Figures 5–7) in which
the putative hydrogenase sequences were incorporated into a con-
straint tree comprised of previously characterized hydrogenases.
The resulting [NiFe]-hydrogenase phylogeny (Figure 5) is con-
gruent with that reported by Vignais et al. (2001) and Vignais and
Billoud (2007), who identiﬁed four monophyletic groups consis-
tent with the original classiﬁcation by Wu and Mandrand (1993).
Each of the four groups includes archaeal and bacterial represen-
tatives. None of the sequences in this study, however, exhibited
signiﬁcant phylogenetic afﬁnity with archaeal hydrogenases. The

phylogenetic relationships of the putative bacterial hydrogenases
are described in detail below.

Group 1 includes the membrane-bound respiratory uptake
hydrogenases, which couple H2 oxidation to a cytochrome,
resulting in proton pumping across the membrane. Nitrogen-
ﬁxing organisms also use Group 1 [NiFe]-hydrogenases to recap-
ture H2 produced by nitrogenase. The [NiFe]-hydrogenase phy-
logeny (Figure 5) shows that many Lost City sequences and
a single WHC2b shotgun sequencing read belong to Group 1.
Two Lost City contigs representing nine reads are most sim-
ilar to hydrogenases from Burkholderiales members Ralstonia
eutropha, Rubrivivax gelatinosus, and Alcaligenes hydrogenophilus.
A third Lost City contig contained a hydrogenase closely related

to that from two Rhodobacter species. Three additional Lost
City reads belong to Group 1, but their phylogenetic afﬁlia-
tions are unresolved. Only one read from WHC2b contained a
Group 1 [NiFe]-hydrogenase, and its closest relative was from
Thiocapsa roseopersicina, a nitrogen-ﬁxing member of order
Chromatiales.

Group 2b includes H2-sensing proteins that are involved
in H2-regulated gene expression and do not directly provide
energy from H2 to the cell (Vignais et al., 2001). They include

Alpha- and Beta-proteobacteria. A cluster of 14 reads representing
the contig WHC2b.C1 are most similar to Burkholderiales Group
2b hydrogenases. Two Lost City reads with unresolved phyloge-
netic afﬁliations are also in the Group 2b clade. Group 2a (not

were detected by this study.

Group 3 includes cytoplasmic hydrogenases capable of
reversible H2 oxidation with a soluble cofactor. Groups 3a and

hydrogenases in Figure 6 but are highly similar to hypothetical hydrogenases.

group to Group 3d, which is speciﬁc to bacteria. The contig
WHC2b.C15 (21 kb, 64% GC) representing eight shotgun reads
clustered with four Lost City contigs and two Burkholderiales
Group 3d hydrogenases. An additional Lost City read is most simi-
lar to cyanobacterial Group 3d hydrogenases. No sequences in this
study shared signiﬁcant similarity with archaeal hydrogenases.

Group 4 includes H2-producing [NiFe]-hydrogenases that are
typically involved in the disposal of excess reducing equivalents in
archaea (Vignais and Billoud, 2007). No Group 4 homologs were
identiﬁed in this study.

[FeFe]-HYDROGENASE DIVERSITY
Whereas [NiFe]-hydrogenases are typically involved in H2 uptake
and oxidation, almost all [FeFe]-hydrogenases catalyze the pro-
duction of H2 (Vignais and Billoud, 2007). (The one known
exception does not have any phylogenetic afﬁliation with any
sequences in this study.) The enzyme can be monomeric, dimeric,
trimeric, or tetrameric in different species, and the variable num-
ber and diversity of paralogs in closely related species obscures
phylogenetic relationships (Vignais et al., 2001). Therefore, [FeFe]-
hydrogenase phylogeny has limited utility for inferring taxo-
nomic afﬁliations of metagenomic sequences. Nevertheless, the
phylogeny illustrated in Figure 6, which is consistent with that
reported by Boyd et al. (2009), shows that all of the putative [FeFe]-
hydrogenase sequences detected in Lost City and Tablelands sam-
ples have close phylogenetic relationships with Clostridia. The
largest cluster of putative [FeFe]-hydrogenase sequences repre-
sents nine shotgun sequencing reads from WHC2b and shares
high sequence similarity with Desulfotomaculum reducens (60%
identity, 76% similarity over 140 amino acid residues). Mem-
bers of genus Desulfotomaculum are typically sulfate-reducers;

some species oxidize H2, and others require organic carbon com-
pounds as electron donors. Some species are incapable of sulfate
reduction, however, and produce H2 during fermentation as part
of a syntrophic relationship with methanogens (Imachi et al.,
2006).

A 1.9 kb contig from Lost City (LC.C146) contains a pre-
dicted [FeFe]-hydrogenase that is most closely related to that of
Candidatus “Desulforudis audaxviator” (Figure 6), a deep subsur-
face organism that is very closely related to the Desulfotomacu-
lum. Its genome sequence encodes multiple hydrogenases, includ-
ing uptake [NiFe]-hydrogenases that indicate the potential for
uptake and oxidation of H2 (Chivian et al., 2008). Only [FeFe]-
hydrogenases (Figure 6) and no [NiFe]-hydrogenases related to
Clostridia, however, were detected in the Lost City or Tablelands
metagenomes.

Figure 7 illustrates phylogenetic relationships among proteins
predicted to be [FeFe]-hydrogenases by homology but are clearly
divergent from and may not be monophyletic with the well-
characterized [FeFe]-hydrogenases in Figure 6. Almost all of these
hypothetical [FeFe]-hydrogenases show high similarity to pre-
dicted proteins in Clostridia genomes, the one exception being a
cluster of 11 reads from WHC2b that is most similar to a predicted
protein from the genome of an unidentiﬁed Erysipelotrichaceae
bacterium. To our knowledge, the only sequence in this tree for
which there is any published experimental characterization is the
HydII of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum, which groups
with a cluster of eight WHC2b reads. This sequence forms a gene
cluster required for H2 production during fermentation by T. sac-
charolyticum, but deletion of the hydII gene alone had no effect on
H2 production (Shaw et al., 2009). Therefore, the sequences in this
tree are potentially associated with H2 production but are not likely
to encode the catalytic subunits of H2-evolving hydrogenases.

It is important to note that these hypothetical hydrogenases are
included in the tblastn results for [FeFe]-hydrogenases reported in
Table 1, and our phylogenetic analyses were required to distinguish
them from homologs of characterized H2-evolving hydrogenases
(Figure 6).

CARBON MONOXIDE DEHYDROGENASE DIVERSITY
The oxidation of carbon monoxide by aerobic carboxydotrophs
(organisms that use CO as their sole electron donor and carbon
source) is catalyzed by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH;
Ragsdale, 2004; King and Weber, 2007). (Note that this enzyme is
distinct from the CODH/ACS enzyme complex that is required for
carbon ﬁxation in the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway discussed below.)
CODH is encoded by the cox, also called cut, genes, which can be

used as marker genes for aerobic carboxydotrophs (King, 2003;
Cunliffe et al., 2008; Cunliffe, 2011). The largest WHC2b contig
in our dataset (WHC2b.C1, 37 kb) contains putative homologs
for the three structural subunits of CODH, CoxMSL. The CoxL
homolog shows a close phylogenetic afﬁnity to other Betapro-
tebacteria CoxL genes (Figure A1 in Appendix) including that
of Hydrogenophaga pseudoﬂava, a facultative anaerobe that can
grow autotrophically on H2 or CO (Willems et al., 1989). The
only other potential CoxL homolog detected in our datasets by
tblastn search was a Lost City shotgun read (Figure A1 in Appen-
dix) that is most similar to Labrenzia aggregata (formerly Stappia
aggregata), a marine aerobic carboxydotroph belonging to the
alphaproteobacterial order Rhodobacterales (Weber and King,
2007).

Serpentinite spring metagenomes

ACETYL-CoA SYNTHASE DIVERSITY
Many Clostridia use H2 to generate acetate, so we explored the
metagenomic data to test whether the clostridial hydrogenases
(Figure 6) are potentially encoded by acetogens. Acetogens and
methanogens utilize the Wood–Ljungdahl (also known as reduc-
tive acetyl-CoA) pathway for carbon ﬁxation, and the key enzyme
acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) is unique to that pathway (Rags-
dale and Pierce, 2008). To investigate the potential for anaerobic
carbon ﬁxation via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway in the Table-
lands springs and Lost City chimneys, we conducted a tblastn
search for ACS sequences in our metagenomes. The phyloge-
netic relationships among the three WHC2b shotgun sequencing
reads and two Lost City shotgun sequencing reads with poten-
tial ACS homologs are displayed in Figure A2 in Appendix. All
three WHC2b sequences cluster with the ACS of Dethiobacter
alkaliphilus, a H2-oxidizing autotrophic Clostridia that can use
acetate as a carbon source but not as an energy source (Sorokin
et al., 2008). To our knowledge, there is no published evidence
that D. alkaliphilus can carry out acetogenesis. The KEGG anno-
tation of its genome available at the DOE Joint Genome Institute’s
IMG database (Markowitz et al., 2008) indicates the presence
of at least three additional homologs required for the Wood–
Ljungdahl pathway, but it is unclear whether a complete pathway
for acetogenesis is present. The ACS of Moorella thermoacetica, a
known thermophilic acetogen (Pierce et al., 2008), has 60% iden-
tity and 78% similarity over 161 amino acid residues with shot-
gun read WHC2b.JXG7G. The Lost City sequences, by contrast,
group with methanogen ACS sequences (Figure A2 in Appen-
dix). Methanosarcinales-related archaea are known to dominate
the anoxic interiors of Lost City chimney bioﬁlm communities
(Schrenk et al., 2004), but methanogen sequences are rare in this
Lost City metagenomic dataset, presumably because it is derived
from more oxidized, exterior portions of the chimney (Brazelton
et al., 2006; Brazelton and Baross, 2010).

DISCUSSION
POTENTIAL FOR H2-FUELED CARBON FIXATION BY BURKHOLDERIALES
The metagenomic and phylogenetic data presented above indicate
that Betaproteobacteria belonging to order Burkholderiales are
potentially important primary producers adapted to the extreme
conditions of the Tablelands springs. Their potential for H2 oxi-
dation is indicated by the diversity of uptake [NiFe]-hydrogenase
sequences (Figure 5) in the WHC2b spring, which are absent
in the TLE spring. Their potential for carbon ﬁxation is indi-
cated by the presence of gene clusters encoding carbon monox-
ide dehydrogenase (CODH) and Rubisco in the largest WHC2b
contig (WHC2b.C1; Figure 4). The phylogenies of the [NiFe]-
hydrogenases, CODH, and 16S rRNA sequences in WHC2b contigs
indicate close relationships with Hydrogenophaga species and Ral-
stonia eutropha (now Cupriavidus necator). These organisms are
facultatively autotrophic; i.e., they only utilize H2 or ﬁx carbon
when organic carbon is unavailable (Willems et al., 1989; Schwartz
et al., 2009). Therefore, further characterization of the physiol-
ogy of these organisms and their access to organic matter in the
Tablelands springs is required to estimate their contribution to pri-
mary production. Furthermore, all Hydrogenophaga and Ralstonia
species are aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, so the corresponding

organisms at the Tablelands and Lost City are likely to inhabit
oxic–anoxic transition zones where they have access to both H2
and oxygen. Both of these systems feature strong oxygen gradi-
ents between the atmosphere and spring water (at the Tablelands)
and between oxygenated seawater and hydrothermal ﬂuid (at Lost
City), so there is potential in each system for organisms to utilize
both H2 and oxygen.

It is unclear whether the TLE spring also hosts H2-fueled carbon
ﬁxation. Although a Burkholderiales 16S rRNA sequence was iden-
tiﬁed in a metagenomic contig from TLE and automated taxonomy
classiﬁers identify many Burkholderiales-related sequences in the
TLE metagenome (MG-RAST and TaxSOM, data not shown), no
hydrogenases were detected in TLE. The absence of hydrogenases
could be due to a combination of lower abundance of Burkholde-
riales in TLE and lower sequencing depth of the TLE metagenome
compared to WHC2b. It is also possible that the Burkholderi-
ales species in TLE have lost their hydrogenase genes, which may
have resulted from the loss of the plasmid potentially represented
by contig WHC2b.C1, as discussed above in the description of
Figure 4.

Most H2-oxidizing autotrophs utilize both membrane-bound
(Group 1) and cytoplasmic (Group 3) [NiFe]-hydrogenases. The
[NiFe]-hydrogenase in the WHC2b.C1 contig belongs to the
Group 2 H2 sensor proteins, which are involved in the regulation
of carbon ﬁxation by H2 but do not directly couple H2 oxida-
tion with energy conservation (Vignais et al., 2001). Therefore,
the evidence from this one contig indicates only that carbon ﬁx-
ation in the corresponding organism is regulated by the presence
of H2 and not necessarily fueled by H2 oxidation. The phylogeny
of the Group 2 [NiFe]-hydrogenase in WHC2b.C1, however, is
congruent with the phylogeny of the Group 3 [NiFe]-hydrogenase
in a 21 kb contig (WHC2b.C15; Figure 5). It seems highly likely
that both contigs are derived from the same species, and both
hydrogenases are highly similar to putative homologs in Ralstonia
eutropha. The Group 1, 2, and 3 hydrogenases in R. eutropha are all
encoded in a 452 kb megaplasmid, and it is possible that contigs
WHC2b.C1 and WHC2b.C15 are partial sequences of the same
plasmid (as described above).

The lack of a Ralstonia-related Group 1 [NiFe]-hydrogenase
in the WHC2b metagenome is puzzling, however (Figure 5).
Nitrosospira multiformis is one of the few examples listed in the
exhaustive survey by Vignais and Billoud (2007) of an organism
that has only a Group 3d [NiFe]-hydrogenase and no representa-
tive from Group 1. The function of the N. multiformis Group 3d
[NiFe]-hydrogenase is unknown but suspected to be the catalysis
of NAD reduction by H2 in order to “increase the overall energetic
yield from ammonia oxidation” (Norton et al., 2008). Therefore, it
is possible that the Ralstonia-like organisms in the Tablelands only
utilize H2 to supplementary their primary electron donor (e.g.,
organic carbon). The current metagenomic dataset from WHC2b
is relatively low coverage, however, and additional sequencing at
higher coverage may eventually recover a Group 1 homolog.

Both Group 1 and Group 3 [NiFe]-hydrogenases related to R.
eutropha are present in several Lost City contigs (Figure 5), indi-
cating that a Ralstonia-related organism with the genetic potential
for H2 oxidation also inhabits Lost City chimneys. The Lost
City metagenomic dataset is dominated by sequences with high

Serpentinite spring metagenomes

similarity to that of Thiomicrospira crunogena, a cosmopolitan
sulfur-oxidizing autotroph in marine hydrothermal vents. Pre-
vious studies have noted the inability of T. crunogena to utilize
H2 as a sole electron donor despite the presence of a Group 1
[NiFe]-hydrogenase in its genome (Scott et al., 2006). None of the
hydrogenases detected in this study have high sequence similarity
to the T. crunogena hydrogenase, nor do any of the large Lost City
contigs expected to correspond to Thiomicrospira-like organisms
contain predicted hydrogenases. Therefore, H2-oxidizing organ-
isms in young, hot Lost City chimneys are most likely aerobic
or facultatively anaerobic Betaproteobacteria belonging to order
Burkholderiales and appear to be less abundant than the dominant
sulfur-oxidizing Thiomicrospira-like population.

POTENTIAL FOR CO UTILIZATION BY BURKHOLDERIALES
Carbon dioxide is extremely scarce in the highly reducing, high
pH ﬂuids of the Tablelands and Lost City, so alternative carbon
species may be more favorable substrates for carbon ﬁxation.
The largest Tablelands contig (WHC2b.C1; Figure 4) includes
the CoxMSL gene cluster which encodes all three subunits of
the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) used by aerobic
carboxydotrophs (Ragsdale, 2004; King and Weber, 2007). This
enzyme is frequently plasmid-encoded (Hugendieek and Meyer,
1992), providing additional but not conclusive evidence that the
WHC2b.C1 contig represents a plasmid. The phylogeny of the
large subunit of CODH from WHC2b.C1 indicates a close phylo-
genetic relationship with Hydrogenophaga pseudoﬂava, an aerobic
autotrophic member of Burkholderiales that can grow on either
H2 or CO (Willems et al., 1989; Kang and Kim, 1999). Therefore,
the phylogeny of the CODH in the WHC2b.C1 contig is consis-
tent with that of the [NiFe]-hydrogenases discussed above. CODH
is typically involved in aerobic oxidation of CO, but some stud-
ies indicate that oxidation of low levels of CO can be coupled to
nitrate rather than oxygen (King, 2006). Therefore, CO utilization
could be advantageous in Tablelands springs when concentrations
of H2, oxygen, and organic compounds are too low to support
growth, but any conclusions about the importance of CO in these
systems will require further investigations. At Lost City, CO uti-
lization seems unlikely because of the abundance and ubiquity of
H2 and because CODH appears to be very rare (identiﬁed in only
a single shotgun sequencing read).

POTENTIAL FOR H2 PRODUCTION BY CLOSTRIDIA
Nearly all of the [FeFe]-hydrogenases detected in the WHC2b
spring at the Tablelands and in the Lost City chimney have close
phylogenetic relationships with putative homologs in Clostridia.
[FeFe]-hydrogenases catalyze H2 production by anaerobic bacte-
ria, typically during fermentation, so one would expect them to be
prevalent in anoxic environments where H2 production is favor-
able. Potential subsurface sources of fermentable organic material
are indicated by elevated levels of dissolved organic carbon in Lost
City ﬂuids (Lang et al., 2010) and the presence of low molecular
weight hydrocarbons with potentially abiogenic origins in both
Lost City and Tablelands ﬂuids (Proskurowski et al., 2008; Szponar
et al., submitted). No hydrogenases were detected in the Tablelands
spring (TLE) that was collected from a more dilute and oxidizing

seep (pH 10.5, Eh + 25 mV) only ∼2 km from WHC2b (pH 12.06,

Eh − 733 mV). Therefore, the presence of [FeFe]-hydrogenases in

the WHC2b metagenome supports the notion that the spring is
supplied by ﬂuid from an anoxic environment. Their presence in
the Lost City chimney could be indicative of anoxic niches within
chimney bioﬁlms and/or the contribution of subsurface ﬂuid to
the chimney sample. The greater abundance of Clostridia-related
16S rRNA gene sequences in younger, hotter Lost City chimneys is
consistent with both of these possibilities (Brazelton et al., 2010).
The community structure of Tablelands springs and Lost City
chimneys, as described here, resembles that of deep boreholes
in South Africa (Moser et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2006). The sub-
surface ﬂuids sampled by these boreholes are also basic (pH
∼9) and enriched in H2 (up to 3.7 mM). The shallow ﬂuids
described by Moser et al. (2005) are dominated by Betapro-
teobacteria belonging to the Comamonadaceae family, and deeper
ﬂuids are comprised almost exclusively of Clostridia afﬁliated
with genus Desulfotomaculum. The deep subsurface Desulfotomac-
ulum-related organisms are predicted to be sulfate-reducers in
these environments, which is consistent with metagenomic data
representing the dominant organism, Candidatus “Desulforudis
audaxviator” (Chivian et al., 2008). Some closely related species,
however, are known to lack the genes required for sulfate reduc-
tion and instead subsist on fermentation, producing H2 as part
of a syntrophic relationship with methanogens (Imachi et al.,
2006). Indeed, no sequences encoding dissimilatory sulﬁte reduc-
tase were identiﬁed in the Tablelands metagenomes, a striking
result compared to the abundance of hydrogenases. The Lost
City metagenome encodes a dissimilatory sulﬁte reductase with
high sequence similarity to multiple Desulfotomaculum species
(Brazelton, 2010), but it was detected in only a single sequencing
read, indicating that it is far less abundant than the hydroge-
nases. Therefore, the Clostridia in Tablelands springs and Lost
City chimneys are potential sulfate-reducers, but the abundance
of [FeFe]-hydrogenases in metagenomic data from both envi-
ronments indicates that they are more likely to be involved in
H2-generating fermentation. It is unclear whether this putative
fermentation is syntrophic with H2-utilizing methanogens. Auto-
mated annotation predicted very few methanogen sequences in the
Tablelands and Lost City metagenomes (data available on the MG-
RAST server), but they were present and may be more abundant
in deeper habitats that were not well-represented in the samples
described in this study.

It is also possible that the Clostridia detected in this study are
acetogens that are adapted to the elevated H2 concentrations in the
Tablelands and Lost City ﬂuids. No sequences encoding acetyl-
CoA synthase were detected at Lost City, but the phylogeny of
ACS sequences from WHC2b is consistent with the presence of
clostridial acetogens in very low abundance. Acetogens are known
to be capable of producing H2 and harboring a wide diversity
of [FeFe]-hydrogenases (Kellum and Drake, 1984; Schmidt et al.,
2010, 2011), so determining the role of these Clostridia in the
H2 budget of these systems will require physiological and biogeo-
chemical investigations. Only three ACS sequences were recovered
from WHC2b, however, and none of these were assembled into
contigs. Therefore, the current dataset indicates that acetogenesis
may occur but does not appear to be prevalent in the Tablelands
springs. It is possible that a more representative sample of the

subsurface habitat underlying the spring could reveal more abun-
dant evidence of acetogenesis, as well as other anaerobic metabolic
pathways.

CONCLUSION
Both the marine and continental serpentinite springs investi-
gated in this study show evidence of aerobic organisms capable
of H2-fueled (or at least H2-regulated) primary production (i.e.,
Burkholderiales) and anaerobic organisms capable of H2 produc-
tion from fermentation of organic carbon (i.e., Clostridia). This
community structure resembles that of the deep subsurface habi-
tat sampled by a ∼3 km deep borehole in South Africa (Moser
et al., 2005), indicating that the surface-exposed springs described
in this study provide access to organisms ﬂushed from the subsur-
face. Furthermore, the remarkably high density of hydrogenases in
both the marine and continental springs (Lost City and WHC2b)
in this study and their complete absence in a spring showing evi-
dence of extensive mixture with surface runoff (TLE) indicate that
the H2-associated metabolic activities discussed here are speciﬁc
to subsurface processes.

The predicted metabolic characteristics of the dominant organ-
isms in the Tablelands springs are consistent with the known
abiogenic products of subsurface serpentinization-associated
processes: H2 and low molecular-weight organic compounds. A
major unanswered question, however, is whether the H2-oxidizing
Burkholderiales subsist on abiogenic H2 generated by serpen-
tinization in the subsurface or if they depend on biogenic H2
produced by Clostridia. In either case, it seems likely that the
Burkholderiales in the Tablelands springs and Lost City chimneys
inhabit oxic–anoxic interfaces where they have access to both H2
and oxygen. Our metagenomic evidence also suggests that these

organisms may be able to survive on carbon monoxide if H2 is
unavailable. The Clostridia are likely inhabitants of anoxic, sub-
surface habitats where they ferment organic compounds into H2,
but the source of these organic compounds is unknown. If they are
ultimately derived from reduction of carbon by serpentinization-
associated reactions (as evidenced in (Proskurowski et al., 2008)
and predicted by experiments reviewed in (McCollom and See-
wald, 2007), then fermentation of these compounds could be con-
sidered a kind of primary production as it would be the generation
of new biomass from non-biological carbon and energy.

Therefore, both the H2-oxidizing Burkholderiales and H2-
producing Clostridia may be important mediators of carbon and
energy exchange between the deep Earth and the surface biosphere.
Further research should investigate whether these organisms are
bona ﬁde denizens of the anoxic subsurface by probing deeper to
obtain more representative samples of deep subsurface habitats.

In particular, the Clostridia and methanogens should be better
represented in deeper samples. Nevertheless, the datasets pre-
sented here represent a proof-of-concept metagenomic study that
demonstrates the potential of surface-exposed springs to yield
insights into the microbial diversity of the subsurface biosphere.
