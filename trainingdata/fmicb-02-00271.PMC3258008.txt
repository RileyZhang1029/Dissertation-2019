Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also called human herpesvirus 8, belongs
to the gamma herpesviruses and is the etiological agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma, primary effu-
sion lymphoma, and some types of multicentric Castleman’s disease. In vivo, KSHV mainly
infects B cells and endothelial cells. The interactions between KSHV and its host cells
determine the outcome of viral infection and subsequent viral pathogenesis. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that are important in ﬁne-tuning cellular signaling.
During infection, KSHV modulates the expression proﬁles and/or functions of a number
of host miRNAs, for example hsa-miR-132 and hsa-miR-146a. Meanwhile, KSHV itself
encodes 12 pre-miRNAs, including miR-K12-11, which is the functional ortholog of the host
miR-155. A number of cellular and viral targets of deregulated cellular miRNAs and viral
miRNAs are found in KSHV-infected cells, which suggests that miRNAs may be important
in mediating KSHV–host interactions. In this review, we summarize our current understand-
ing of how KSHV modulates the expression and/or functions of host miRNAs; we review
in detail the functions of miR-K12-11 as the ortholog of miR-155; and we examine the
functions of viral miRNAs in KSHV life cycle control, immune evasion, and pathogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
The human tumor virus Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
(KSHV), also called human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), is the etiologi-
cal agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), the most common malignance
in AIDS patients, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and some
types of multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD; Chang et al.,
1994; Cesarman et al., 1995; Soulier et al., 1995). The outcomes of
viral infection and viral pathogenesis are determined by interac-
tions between KSHV and host cells. Like all other herpesviruses,
KSHV has two life cycle phases: latency and lytic replication. Only a
few viral genes, such as latency-associated nuclear antigen [LANA,
open reading frame (ORF) 73], viral cyclin (vCyclin, ORF72), and
viral FLIP (vFLIP, ORF71), are expressed during latent infection
and drive host cells proliferation and prevent apoptosis. Lytic
transcripts, such as ORFK1, viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6, ORFK2),
and viral G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) contribute to ini-
tiating angiogenesis and inﬂammatory lesions in host cells, and
ultimately KS (Mesri et al., 2010). Both latent and lytic genes con-
tribute to KSHV pathogenesis. Although a large number of diverse
microRNAs (miRNAs) with potential regulatory functions exist
in cell types from several different species (Lagos-Quintana et al.,
2001; Lau et al., 2001; Lee and Ambros, 2001), their role in virus–
host interactions was not investigated until the recent discovery
of virus-encoded miRNAs (Pfeffer et al., 2004). Here we review
our current understanding of the roles of both virally encoded
and cellular miRNAs in KSHV virus–host interactions. Because
of conserved similarities among the herpesvirus family, some of
these examples might also apply to other viruses in this family.

THE BIOGENESIS OF HOST AND VIRAL miRNAs
MicroRNAs are approximately 22 nucleotide (nt)-long non-
coding RNAs with regulatory functions that are expressed by all
multicellular eukaryotes (Bartel, 2009). In the canonical pathway
for miRNAs biogenesis, primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) that form
an imperfect stem-loop with a hairpin bulge are ﬁrst transcribed
by RNA Pol II from miRNA genes. These pri-miRNAs are then
processed by microprocessor which is composed of the RNase III
enzyme Drosha and its co-factor DGCR8. The processed products
called precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) have a hairpin structure
of ∼70 nts and are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by
a Ran GTPase called Exportin-5. In the cytoplasm, the stem-loops
of pre-miRNAs are further cleaved by another RNase III, Dicer,
and the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding protein TRBP
leaving a ∼22-nt RNA duplex. Often, one strand of the duplex is
preferentially incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing com-
∗
plex (RISC). The other strand, known as miRNA star (miRNA
) or
the passenger strand, is often degraded. RISC loaded with mature
miRNA is subsequently guided by the miRNA to pair with tar-
get transcripts at the 3
UTR) and induces
posttranscriptional silencing (Bartel, 2009). In addition to the
canonical pathways for generating miRNAs, some non-canonical
ways to produce miRNA also exist (see review Yang and Lai, 2011).
Since Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) was ﬁrst shown to encode sev-
eral miRNAs (Pfeffer et al., 2004), many other viruses, especially
herpesviruses including KSHV, have also been demonstrated to
encode their own miRNAs. Most known viral miRNA genes are
expressed using the canonical pathways of miRNA biogenesis with

untranslated region (3

miRNAs modulate KSHV–host interactions

only two exceptions for γ-herpesvirus. In murine γ-herpesvirus
type 68 (also known as murid herpesvirus 4), miRNA genes
embedded in tRNA-like transcripts are transcribed by RNA Pol III
instead of Pol II (Bogerd et al., 2010; Diebel et al., 2010). Another
exception is from Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-encoded miRNAs.
Three of the seven HVS-encoded Sm-class U RNAs (HSURs) give
rise to six mature miRNAs derived from hairpin structures located
immediately downstream of the 3
end processing signals. The pro-
cessing of these miRNAs is not dependent on the microprocessor
complex. Instead, the Integrator complex is required to generate
(cid:3)
the 3
end of HSURs and the pre-miRNA hairpins. Pre-miRNAs
are subsequently exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5, and
Dicer is required to generate mature viral miRNAs (Cazalla et al.,
2011).

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes 12 pre-
miRNAs that produce 25 mature miRNAs (Summarized in
Table 1) through the canonical pathway for miRNA biogenesis
(Cai et al., 2005; Pfeffer et al., 2005; Samols et al., 2005; Grund-
hoff et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2010; Umbach and Cullen, 2010). Ten
of these miRNA precursors are organized into clusters within the
latent genes locus. The other two pre-miRNAs (miR-K12-10, miR-
K12-12) are located within the 3
UTR of ORF K12. All these viral
miRNAs share two common promoters with the viral latent tran-
scripts (Pearce et al., 2005; Cai and Cullen, 2006). Interestingly,
the primary sequences of both miR-K12-10 and miR-K12-12 can
be cleaved by Drosha in cis, which results in reduced transcript
K12 and decreased K12 protein expression (Lin and Sullivan,
2011). KSHV-encoded miRNAs were initially discovered in viral
latency (Cai et al., 2005; Pfeffer et al., 2005; Samols et al., 2005;
Grundhoff et al., 2006), but are also detected in lytic replica-
tion (Lin et al., 2010; Umbach and Cullen, 2010). The expression
levels of some viral miRNAs are even higher in the lytic phase
compared to the latent phase (Lin et al., 2010; Umbach and
Cullen, 2010). It will be interesting in the future to determine
the reason for this differential expression pattern in the viral life
cycle.

miRNAs AS A MEDIATOR IN THE VIRUS–HOST INTERACTION
NETWORK
Since the discovery of miRNA, we have known that it modu-
lates gene expression post-transcriptionally through targeting the
(cid:3)
3
UTRs of target genes or through inducing degradation of tar-
get gene transcripts (Lee et al., 1993). The expression of miRNAs
themselves is also strictly regulated through different mechanisms.
The discovery of virus-encoded miRNAs in herpesviruses provides
us with an opportunity to reevaluate the interactions between
the virus and its host from a new perspective. Based on the pro-
found regulatory effects of miRNAs, we propose a four-component
model to depict viral–host interactions. In this model, viral genes,
viral miRNAs, host genes, and host miRNAs are four mediators
of cellular signaling that regulate each others’ expression by vari-
ous means (Figure 1). This complicated and elaborate regulatory
network mediating virus–host interactions determines the out-
come of virus infection. Since herpesviruses establish long-term
latency in the cell, they have multiple strategies to dominate the
signaling network to favor long-term infection. The importance
of virally hijacked host miRNAs and deregulated viral miRNAs

in herpesvirus infection and pathogenesis has turned out to be
beyond our expectations. In the following section, we review the
critical roles of both cellular and viral miRNAs in KSHV infection
(Summarized in Table 2).

KSHV MODULATES THE EXPRESSION PROFILE AND/OR
FUNCTION OF HOST miRNAs
To date, more than 1400 mature miRNAs have been identiﬁed
in humans (Kozomara and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011), forming a del-
icate miRNA system that is critical for ﬁne-tuning the cellular
signaling network. The expression proﬁle of human miRNAs
varies signiﬁcantly among different cell types and can be mod-
ulated by many cellular events. Increasing evidence suggests that
virus infection can inﬂuence the expression proﬁle of host miR-
NAs, resulting from either defensive host signaling against virus
infection or viral hijacking to favor virus infection. Therefore,
host miRNAs are important in balancing virus–host interactions.
Viral gene products regulate host miRNA expression through gene
alteration, transcription regulation or processing, directly or indi-
rectly. In some cases they even modulate the function of host
miRNAs. When herpesviruses establish long-term latency in the
host cells, virus-speciﬁc host miRNAs expression pattern, or miR-
NAs signature, is established. Thus, the host miRNA system is an
important tool that is hijacked by the herpesvirus for viral latency
maintenance and viral pathogenesis.

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus mainly infects human
endothelial cells (ECs) and B cells in vivo. Therefore, knowing the
effects of KSHV infection on the host miRNA expression pro-
ﬁles of these two cell types will be interesting. Using quantitative
PCR (qPCR)-based arrays, O’Hara et al. (2008) identiﬁed 68 miR-
NAs speciﬁcally expressed in PEL cell lines rather than in KSHV
non-related lymphoma cell lines and tonsil tissues. However, the
question remains whether these PEL-speciﬁc miRNAs are regu-
lated directly by KSHV gene products or are the consequence of
long-term infection and oncogenesis. To answer this question, in
a later study, O’Hara et al. proﬁled PEL cell lines, KSHV-infected
ECs, uninfected ECs, and primary KS biopsies for host miRNAs
expression using a qPCR-based array. After adjustment for mul-
tiple comparisons, they identiﬁed 18 KSHV-regulated miRNAs.
Moreover, they demonstrated that the tumor suppressor miR-
NAs in the let-7 family and miR-220/221 are downregulated in
KSHV-associated cancers, including PEL and KS (O’Hara et al.,
2009).

To determine the host miRNA proﬁle during early KSHV infec-
tion, Lagos et al. detected host miRNA expression at 6 and 72 h
post-KSHV infection of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) using
an miRNA microarray. They identiﬁed two groups of miRNAs
induced during primary KSHV infection. The ﬁrst group consisted
of nine miRNAs that reached their peak expression at 6 h post-
infection, including hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-31, and hsa-miR-132.
Expression levels of ﬁve miRNAs from the second group, includ-
ing hsa-miR-193a and hsa-let-7i, steadily increased over the 72
post-infection hours (Lagos et al., 2010).

Although the functions of human miRNAs have been exten-
sively studied and KSHV clearly regulates host miRNA expression,
the roles of host miRNAs in KSHV infection are less well under-
stood than the functions of the viral miRNAs. Based on a limited

loop to modulate the intensity and/or duration of the interferon
response (Cameron et al., 2008). Therefore, hsa-miR-146a might
be another common host miRNA target of herpesvirus infection.
Tsai et al. showed that K15M (the minor form of KSHV K15)
induces expression of hsa-miR-21 and hsa-miR-31. Knocking
down both of these miRNAs eliminates K15M-induced cell motil-
ity. Therefore, K15M might contribute to KSHV-mediated tumor
metastasis and angiogenesis via regulation of hsa-miR-21 and hsa-
miR-31 (Tsai et al., 2009). In another study, Wu et al. explored
the genes and miRNAs involved in KSHV-induced cell motility by
combining gene and miRNA proﬁle data. They showed that KSHV
induces global changes of miRNA expression in LECs. Speciﬁcally,
the hsa-miR-221/hsa-miR-222 cluster is downregulated, whereas
hsa-miR-31 is upregulated. Both LANA and Kaposin B repress the
expression of the hsa-miR-221/hsa-miR-222 cluster, which results
in upregulation of their target gene ETS1 or ETS2 and is sufﬁcient
to induce EC migration. In contrast, upregulated hsa-miR-31 stim-
ulates EC migration by reduction its target gene FAT4 (Wu et al.,
2011).

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus not only modulates
host miRNAs expression, but also modulates the function of some
host miRNAs. Kang et al. showed direct repression of vIL-6 by
hsa-miR-1293 and repression of hIL-6 by hsa-miR-608. They also
found that KSHV ORF57 and hsa-miR-1293/hsa-miR-608 com-
pete for the same binding site on vIL-6/hIL-6 mRNA. ORF57
binding results in escape of viral and human IL-6 from miRNA-
mediated suppression, contributing to KSHV pathogenesis (Kang
et al., 2010, 2011).

Cazalla et al. (2010) showed that the HVS-encoded non-coding
RNA, HSUR1, directs host miR-27 degradation and subsequent
reduction of miR-27 target genes. This evidence also supports the
hypothesis that viral genes can regulate host miRNA expression
and function.

The function of host miRNAs in KSHV infection is increasingly
a topic of interest in the ﬁeld. More KSHV-regulated host miRNAs
are being identiﬁed, and their function is usually clearer than that
of viral miRNAs. We can therefore apply knowledge about other
host miRNAs to the KSHV ﬁeld to help understand the functions

number of studies, we infer that KSHV hijacks the host miRNA
system to favor infection and pathogenesis.

Lagos et al. showed that KSHV-induced hsa-miR-132 expres-
sion via a CREB-dependent pathway. The miRNA hsa-miR-132
negatively regulates interferon pathways by targeting the p300
transcriptional co-activator to facilitate viral replication. Inter-
estingly, they show a similar function for hsa-miR-132 during
infection of monocytes with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and
human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Therefore, induction of hsa-
miR-132 might be a common strategy for herpesvirus to control
innate immunity at early stage of infection (Lagos et al., 2010).
However, more extensive studies are needed to clarify the com-
mon signaling pathway that is responsible for CREB-mediated
hsa-miR-132 activation.

Another host miRNA upregulated by KSHV is hsa-miR-146a
(Lagos et al., 2010; Punj et al., 2010). Punj et al. showed that vFLIP
is responsible for hsa-miR-146a upregulation. They identiﬁed two
NF-κB sites in the promoter of hsa-miR-146a that are essential for
its activation by vFLIP. Upregulation of hsa-miR-146a suppresses
its target CXCR4; downregulation of CXCR4 might contribute
to KS development by promoting premature release of KSHV-
infected endothelial progenitors into circulation (Punj et al., 2010).
Indeed, hsa-miR-146a is also reported to be upregulated by EBV
LMP1, and hsa-miR-146a might function in a negative feedback

KSHV ENCODES ORTHOLOGS OF HOST miRNAs
Many KSHV-encoded ORFs are pirated from the host genome.
An interesting question is whether KSHV also pirates pre-miRNA
genes from the host genome. Early in the identiﬁcation of KSHV
miRNAs, two independent studies reported that miR-K12-11 is the
ortholog of host hsa-miR-155 and these miRNAs have identical
seed sequence (Gottwein et al., 2007; Skalsky et al., 2007). Hsa-
miR-155 is a multifunctional miRNA that is important in immu-
nity, hematopoiesis, inﬂammation, and oncogenesis (McClure and

Sullivan, 2008). Not only miR-K12-11, but also miR-M4, which is
encoded by the highly oncogenic Marek’s disease virus of chickens,
is a functional ortholog of hsa-miR-155(Zhao et al., 2009). EBV
does not encode a hsa-miR-155 ortholog. Instead, EBV-induced
hsa-miR-155 expression by LMP1 and hsa-miR-155 is important
in EBV viral pathogenesis (Motsch et al., 2007; Gatto et al., 2008;
Lu et al., 2008). Of note, hsa-miR-155 is downregulated in KSHV-
infected cells (Gottwein et al., 2007; Skalsky et al., 2007); therefore
KSHV might encode miR-K12-11 to replace the function of its
ortholog, hsa-miR-155.

Since miR-K12-11 shares an identical seed sequence with hsa-
miR-155, these two miRNAs may have similar functions and target

the same genes. Gottwein et al. (2007) used a range of assays to
show that expression of physiological levels of miR-K12-11 or
hsa-miR-155 results in the downregulation of an extensive set
of common mRNA targets, including genes with known roles in
cell growth regulation, for example BACH1. Moreover, Qin et al.
(2010) found that KSHV-encoded microRNAs upregulate xCT
expression in macrophages and ECs, largely through miR-K12-11
suppression of BACH1, a negative regulator of transcription that
recognizes antioxidant response elements within gene promoters.
To compare miR-K12-11 and hsa-miR-155 functions in vivo,
Boss et al. used a foamy virus vector to express the miRNAs
in human hematopoietic progenitors and performed immune
reconstitutions in NOD/LtSz-scid IL2Rγ (null) mice. They found
that ectopic expression of miR-K12-11 or hsa-miR-155 target-
ing C/EBPβ, leads to a signiﬁcant expansion of the CD19 (+)
B-cell population in the spleen. This in vivo study validates miR-
K12-11 as a functional ortholog of hsa-miR-155 in the context of
hematopoiesis (Boss et al., 2011).

Our study indicated that miR-K12-11 is involved in atten-
uating interferon signaling and contributing to KSHV latency
maintenance through targeting I-kappa-B kinase epsilon (IKKε).
We demonstrated that miR-K12-11 attenuated IFN signaling
by decreasing IKKε-mediated IRF3/IRF7 phosphorylation. We
also demonstrated that IKKε enhances KSHV reactivation syner-
gistically with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate treatment.
Moreover, inhibition of miR-K12-11 enhances KSHV reactivation
induced by vesicular stomatitis virus infection. Taken together, our
ﬁndings suggest that miR-K12-11 can contribute to maintenance
of KSHV latency by targeting IKKε (Liang et al., 2011).

More recently, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of
miR-K12-11 downregulates TGF-β signaling and facilitates cell
proliferation upon TGF-β treatment by directly targeting SMAD5.
Our ﬁndings highlight a novel mechanism in which miR-K12-11
downregulates TGF-β signaling, and suggests that viral miRNAs
and proteins may exert a dichotomous regulation in virus-induced
oncogenesis by targeting the same signaling pathway (Liu et al.,
2011).

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus exploits miR-K12-11
to tap into a host miRNA regulatory network (McClure and Sul-
livan, 2008). Based on the important functions of hsa-miR-155,
we believe that miR-K12-11 is of particular importance in KSHV
infection and pathogenesis.

Using Target Scan5.0 (Lewis et al., 2005), we found that miR-
K12-2 shares the same seed sequence as miR-1183 (unpublished
data). The function of miR-1183 is poorly understood. Further
study is needed to conﬁrm whether miR-K12-2 is the true ortholog
of miR-1183, and to determine the function of these two miRNAs
in KSHV infection.

FUNCTIONS OF VIRAL miRNA IN KSHV INFECTION
IDENTIFYING TARGETS OF KSHV-ENCODED miRNA
Studying the function of a particular miRNA can begin by sim-
ply predicting targets using software such as TargetScan, PicTar, or
DIANA MicroT (Krek et al., 2005; Lewis et al., 2005; Maragkakis
et al., 2009). These programs are based on the qualitative and
quantitative properties and the thermodynamic nature of the
miRNA/target heteroduplex (Lieber and Haas, 2011). However,

most of these algorithms are not optimized for viral miRNAs and
can yield many false-positive viral miRNA targets.

Laganà and colleagues developed the program miRiam, mod-
iﬁed for prediction of viral miRNA targets. miRiam uses both
thermodynamic features and empirical constraints to predict
interactions between viral miRNAs and human targets. It exploits
target mRNA secondary structure accessibility and interaction
rules, inferred from validated miRNA/mRNA pairs. A set of target
genes for EBV and KSHV miRNAs that are involved in apopto-
sis and cell-cycle regulation was identiﬁed using miRiam (Lagana
et al., 2010).

In addition to bioinformatic methods, high throughput gene
proﬁle technologies such as cDNA microarrays can be used to
identify viral miRNA targets. In an early study, Samols et al.
(2007) performed gene expression proﬁling in cells stably express-
ing KSHV-encoded miRNAs, and identiﬁed a set of 81 genes
whose expression was signiﬁcantly changed in the presence of miR-
NAs. To increase the accuracy of this method, Ziegelbauer et al.
developed a tandem array-based expression screening method to
identify KSHV miRNA targets. Their approach is based on mul-
tiple screens that examine small changes in transcript abundance
under different conditions of miRNA expression or inhibition,
followed by searching the identiﬁed transcripts for seed sequence
matches. They identiﬁed Bcl2-associated factor BCLAF1 as a target
for multiple KSHV miRNAs (Ziegelbauer et al., 2009). In addi-
tion to cDNA microarrays, protein proﬁling technologies such
as stable isotope-labeling by amino acids, or SILAC, in cell cul-
ture are also being used to identify miRNA targets (Vinther et al.,
2006).

A more direct identiﬁcation of miRNA targets can be achieved
by immunoprecipitation (IP) of Argonaute protein-containing
complexes followed by microarray analysis of the associated
mRNAs, in a method called RIP-chip (Keene et al., 2006; Beitzinger
et al., 2007). Dolken et al. (2010) used Ago2-based RIP-chip
to identify transcripts targeted by KSHV miRNAs (n = 114),
EBV miRNAs (n = 44), and cellular miRNAs (n = 2337) in six
latently infected or stably transduced human B-cell lines. Now,
high throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking
IP of Argonaute-containing complexes, or Ago-HITS-CLIP; (Chi
et al., 2009) and photoactivatable, ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-
linking and IP, or PAR-CLIP (Hafner et al., 2010), have been
developed to identify targets for host and viral miRNA more pre-
cisely. A summary of methods to identify miRNA targets is in
Figure 2.

KSHV miRNAs AND VIRAL LIFE CYCLE CONTROL
The idea that viral miRNA is involved in viral latency regulation
ﬁrst came from the ﬁnding that SV40-encoded miR-S1 targets
the viral large T-antigen (Sullivan et al., 2005). This results in
reduced expression of viral T-antigen but not infectious virus rel-
ative to that generated from a miRNA deletion mutant (Sullivan
et al., 2005). In HSV-1, studies showed that two miRNAs encoded
by HSV-1, miR-H2-3p, and miR-H6, facilitate the establishment
and maintenance of viral latency by targeting viral immediate
early transactivators ICP0 and ICP4.5, respectively (Umbach et al.,
2008). Similar results in HSV-2, found that miR-β contributes to
viral latency control through silencing ICP0 expression (Tang et al.,

miRNAs modulate KSHV–host interactions

Further studies showed a putative NFIB-binding site is located in
the RTA promoter and shRNA knockdown of NFIB resulted in
decreased RTA expression.

Taken together, the evidence suggests that multiple KSHV-
encoded miRNAs are involved in viral latency maintenance and
herpes viral latency control is important and a complex process.
These data support the hypothesis that conservation among her-
pesviruses allows them to use viral miRNA(s) to target immediate
early genes to control viral latency (Murphy et al., 2008).

KSHV miRNA AND IMMUNE REGULATION
To establish long-term latent infection in the host cell, KSHV
has developed multiple strategies to evade the host innate and
adaptive immunity (Areste and Blackbourn, 2009). Some stud-
ies suggest that KSHV-encoded miRNAs are involved in immune
regulation and favor KSHV infection. For example, several her-
pesviruses, including KSHV, encode an miRNA that targets the
MHC class I-related chain B (MICB), which is a stress-induced
ligand recognized by the NKG2D receptor expressed by NK cells
and CD8+ T-cells. In 2007, Stern-Ginossar et al. identiﬁed that
HCMV miRNA miR-UL112-1 targets MICB. They showed that
HCMV-miR-UL112 speciﬁcally downregulates MICB expression
during viral infection, leading to decreased binding of NKG2D
and reduced killing by NK cells (Stern-Ginossar et al., 2007).
They further showed that both EBV miR-BART2-5p and KSHV-
miR-K12-7 regulate MICB expression (Nachmani et al., 2009).
Moreover, Thomas et al. showed that the KSHV immune evasion
gene, K5, reduces cell-surface expression of the NKG2D ligands
MHC class I-related chain A (MICA) and MICB, probably by K5-
mediated ubiquitylation, which signals internalization and causes
a potent reduction in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. These studies
suggested that NKG2D ligands are common targets for both KSHV
miRNA and ORF for evading NK cell antiviral function (Thomas
et al., 2008). Another example is that miR-K12-11 directly targets
IKKε, an important modulator of IFN signaling.

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus miRNAs also regu-
late the host immune response by modulating expression of
cytokines. Abend et al. demonstrated that miR-K12-10a robustly
downregulates the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like
weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) receptor (TWEAKR). The
downregulation of TWEAKR by miR-K10a in primary human
ECs results in a decrease in expression of the proinﬂamma-
tory cytokines IL-8 and monocyte chemo attractant protein 1
in response to TWEAK. This protects cells from apoptosis and
suppresses a proinﬂammatory response (Abend et al., 2010). Qin
et al. (2009) demonstrated that miR-K12-3 and miR-K12-7 tar-
get C/EBPβ p20 (LIP), a negative transcriptional regulator of
IL-6 and IL-10, and induces expression of IL-6 and IL-10 in
macrophages. These cytokines have broad functions in oncoge-
nesis and immune suppression. The function of miR-K12-3 and
miR-K12-7 in immune regulation needs to be further studied
(Boss and Renne, 2011).

KSHV miRNAs AND VIRAL PATHOGENESIS
In addition to viral life cycle control and viral immune evasion,
KSHV-encoded miRNAs have other functions directly related to
pathogenesis.

2009). Studies in HCMV showed that virus-encoded miR-UL112-
1 controls viral latency by inhibiting the viral immediate early gene
72 (IE72; Murphy et al., 2008). The authors predicted that other
herpesviruses might use a similar strategy to control viral latency.
Studies from KSHV-encoded miRNAs conﬁrmed this hypoth-
esis. Several miRNAs have been found to affect the expression
level of the viral immediate early gene replication and transcrip-
tion activator (RTA), either directly (Bellare and Ganem, 2009;
Lu et al., 2010b; Lin et al., 2011) or indirectly (Lei et al., 2010;
Lu et al., 2010a). Bellare et al. using miRNA mimics or speciﬁc
inhibitors for KSHV-encoded miRNAs and reporter constructs
containing the RTA 3
UTR, found that miR-K12-9-5p targets
RTA directly, and depends on the canonical 6-mer seed match
site. When this miRNA was inhibited by a speciﬁc antagomir, a
moderate increase in lytic replication was observed (Bellare and
Ganem, 2009). A second study by Lu et al. (2010b) using constructs
expressing KSHV-encoded miRNAs and a reporter containing the
RTA 3
UTR demonstrated that miR-K12-5 represses RTA expres-
(cid:3)
sion, although the RTA 3
UTR lacks a canonical miR-K12-5 seed
sequence. In another study by us, a reporter containing the RTA
(cid:3)
3
UTR and constructs expressing all 12 pre-miRNAs, miR-K12-9,
and miR-K12-7-5p were found to target RTA directly. miR-K12-
7-5p, targeting RTA, was shown to be mediated by a 7-mer seed
match site. Additionally, endogenous RTA expression level was
reduced by ectopically overexpressing miR-K12-7 and derepressed
using an miR-K12-7-5p inhibitor. A decrease in viral particles was
observed when miR-K12-7 was overexpressed (Lin et al., 2011).
Lei et al. used an miR-cluster deletion mutant virus to determine
that miR-K12-1 represses IκB, an inhibitor of NFκB. Inhibition
of IκB leads to NFκB activation, which suppresses RTA to facil-
itate viral latency control (Lei et al., 2010). Lu et al. (2010a),
using a lentivirus expressing individual KSHV miRNA, found that
miR-K12-3 reduces RTA mRNA levels by targeting NFIB directly.

miRNAs modulate KSHV–host interactions

Samols et al. (2007) identiﬁed THBS1 as a target of several
KSHV miRNAs. THBS1 is a strong tumor suppressor and anti-
angiogenic factor. They proposed that KSHV-encoded miRNAs
contribute directly to pathogenesis by downregulation of THBS1,
promoting cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Gottwein
et al. reported that miR-K1 directly targets the cellular cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitor p21, strongly attenuating the cell-cycle
arrest that normally occurs upon p53 activation. They suggested
that this KSHV miRNA likely contributes to the oncogenic poten-
tial of KSHV (Gottwein and Cullen, 2010). Hansen et al. demon-
strated that multiple KSHV miRNAs contribute to virally induced
reprogramming by silencing the cellular transcription factor MAF,
which prevents expression of blood vascular endothelial cells
(BECs) speciﬁc genes, thereby maintaining the differentiation
status of LECs. These ﬁndings demonstrate that KSHV miR-
NAs could inﬂuence the differentiation status of infected cells,
contributing to KSHV-induced oncogenesis (Hansen et al., 2010).
Using developing systems biology methods, the target list of
KSHV miRNAs is rapidly increasing (Lieber and Haas, 2011). The
functions of KSHV miRNAs include, but are not limited to, viral
life cycle control, immune regulation, and pathogenesis. KSHV
miRNAs are important mediators of viral–host interactions. Using
viral miRNA knockout viruses will allow studies that lead to an
overall understanding of the functions of unique KSHV miRNAs.

CONCLUSION
MicroRNAs are small, regulatory, non-coding RNAs with diverse
functions in ﬁne-tuning cellular signaling. KSHV modulates
host miRNA expression and also encodes 25 mature viral miR-
NAs. Increasing evidence suggests that both virally hijacked
host miRNAs and dysregulated viral miRNAs are important
in KSHV life cycle control, immune evasion, and pathogene-
sis. In this review, we propose a four-component model for
viral–host interactions (Figure 1). Existing evidence supports
this model (Table 2), with examples for almost every action
mode in this model of virus–host interactions. Using RNAhy-
brid (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid/), we pre-
dict, according to our model, that KSHV-encoded polyadenylated
nuclear RNA (PAN, also known as nut-1) functions as an miRNA
sponge to inhibit KSHV-encoded miR-K12-9-5p. Based on the
profound effects of miRNAs as mediators in virus–host interac-
tions, we believe they will become emerging therapy targets for
treating KSHV infection and KSHV-related malignancies.
