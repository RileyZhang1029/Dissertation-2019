Background: It is recognized that Candida dubliniensis commonly colonizes oral and subgingival sites in
immunocompetent subjects with periodontal disease.
Objective: Since there are few data available on genetic characterization of C. dubliniensis in periodontal
pockets and other oral sites, the aim of this study was to characterize subgingival and mucosal C. dubliniensis
isolates recovered from immunocompetent subjects and to assay the genetic similarity of such isolates from
both niches in the same patient by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD).
Design: C. dubliniensis recovered from subgingival plaque and from buccal cavity samples were studied in 240
immunocompetent non-smoking individuals. Arbitrary amplification was carried out by RAPD-polymerase
chain reaction (PCR).
Results: RAPD analysis showed identical genotypes of C. dubliniensis in different sampling sites (buccal cavity
and subgingival areas) in eight of 10 patients except for those derived from two participants who presented
presumably unrelated isolates.
Conclusions: On the basis of the findings presented, the origin of the colonization of C. dubliniensis in
subgingival biofilm seems to be the buccal cavity in a single patient. Consequently, it may be assumed that
most of C. dubliniensis in these sites arise from the endogenous commensal strains.

Yeasts of the Candida genus are opportunistic

commensals in the human mouth, representing
potential sources of oropharyngeal candidiasis,
as well as other more serious forms of the disease, such as
esophageal and systemic diseases (1, 2). Candida species
have also been recovered from periodontal pockets in a
large number (7.119.6%) of patients with periodontal
disease (38).

Although the yeast most

frequently associated to
this type of infection is Candida albicans, other less
prevalent emerging species have been isolated (4, 6, 7,
912).

Mucosal surfaces are the primary body reservoirs for
these microorganisms (13). This reflects the ability of the
yeast to colonize different oral surfaces and the variety of

factors which predispose the host to Candida colonization
and subsequent infection. Colonization of the oral cavity
appears to be facilitated by several specific adherence
interactions between Candida species and oral surfaces
which enable the yeast to resist host clearance mechan-
isms. Mucosal and subgingival Candida dubliniensis
colonization has been reported in immunocompetent
subjects with periodontal disease (6, 7, 14) and both
oral sites are appropriate niches for multiplication of this
species.

It would seem relevant to know about epidemiological
aspects of subgingival C. dubliniensis, given its capacity to
adhere to bacteria in the oral microbiota, and to
coaggregate, that enables it to colonize the depth of
subgingival biofilm (4, 11, 15, 16).

In recent years, several molecular typing methods have
been used to characterize Candida species isolates and to
delineate strain relatedness, although polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) based methods remain the most widely
used. Among these, the random amplified polymorphic
DNA (RAPD) method of DNA fingerprinting has
become quite popular for all infectious fungi and has
been successfully applied to assess the genetic relatedness
of Candida species (1724). These methods have greatly
enhanced knowledge about the epidemiology of oral and
subgingival Candida species, and they can provide valu-
able information by their capacity to distinguish distinct
isolates of the same species. Some studies have demon-
strated that commensal yeasts dominate in oral candi-
diasis, whereas
that
evidence
genetically homogeneous, hypervirulent
strains of
C. albicans are involved in the disease (2528).

Since there are few data available on genetic character-
ization of C. dubliniensis in periodontal pockets and other
oral sites, the aim of this study was to characterize
subgingival and mucosal C. dubliniensis isolates recovered
from immunocompetent subjects and to assay the genetic
similarity of C. dubliniensis isolates from both niches in
the same patient by RAPD.

Material and methods

Sources of isolates
A total of 21 isolates of C. dubliniensis, 10 from the buccal
cavity and 11 from subgingival biofilm, were collected
from 240 non-smoking individuals who attended the
dental clinic of the University of Buenos Aires, Argen-
tina. Periodontal evaluations included clinical examina-
tion and radiographs with clinical measurements: clinical
attachment level (CAL), pocket depth (PD), plaque index
(29), gingival index (30), and bleeding on probing (BOP).
Location of the gingival margin was determined and
tooth mobility was assessed. Measurements were made at
four sites per tooth (mesial, buccal, distal, and lingual
positions) at 15 teeth excluding the third molar.

Participation in our survey was voluntary and all the

patients provided a written informed consent.

Sampling, culture conditions, and identification of
isolates
All the volunteers were requested to thoroughly rinse
their mouths with sterile distilled water. The dental
professional then isolated the area to be sampled by
means of cotton rolls and a high-speed suction device.
Following removal of the supragingival plaque, in order
to avoid contamination, four subgingival plaque sam-
ples were taken from each patient: the upper right and
lower central incisor, the first upper right molar and the
first

periodontal pockets infected in periodontitis, by using a

7/8 sterile Gracey curette. Samples were pooled and
cultured on a differential chromogenic medium (CHRO-
Magar Candida, Paris, France). Buccal cavity samples,
including palatal, buccal mucosa, and tongue, were
collected by sterile
cotton-tipped swabs and were
streaked directly onto the chromogenic medium. Iso-
lated yeasts were identified by conventional mycological
methods: colony color on the chromogenic medium,
micromorphology in agar milk with 1% Tween 80 (31),
and carbohydrate assimilation tests using the commer-
cially available kit API ID 32C (†BioMe´rieux, France).
Further studies were conducted for characterization of
C. dubliniensis, including chlamydospore formation on
Staib agar after incubation for 72 h at 288C (32) and
specific PCR with primers from actin gene (ACT1)-
associated intron sequences of C. dubliniensis, DUBF
(GTATTTGTCCTTCCCCTTTTC) and DUBR (GTGT
TGTGTGCACTAACGTC) (7, 33).

RandomamplifiedpolymorphicDNA(RAPD)analysis
Yeast DNA was isolated according to a previously
described technique (7, 34, 35). The DNA was quantified
and its purity was evaluated at 260 nm (SmartSpecTM
3000 Spectrophotometer BIO-RAD).

Five different primers were included in the typing
assays. Primer sequences were as follows: OPA 02
(TGCCGAGCTG), OPA 09 (GGGTAACGCC), M13F
(CGACGTTGTAAAACGACGCCCAGT), M13R (CA-
GGAAACAGCTATGAC), and OCP 5 (GATGACC-
GCC). All were used in RAPD-PCR following the
method of Williams et al. (36).

Arbitrary amplification was performed in a total
volume of 50 ml containing: 1 buffer 2.5 mM MgCl2,
0.2 mM each of the dNTP, 0.5 mM of the primer, 1.25 U
Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and 75 ng of template
DNA. The cycling program was made up of 4 min at
948C, 35 cycles of 1 min at 948C, 1 min at 258C, 2 min at
728C followed by a final extension of 5 min at 728C.
These steps were carried out in a Minicycler DNA
thermal cycler (TM MJ Research Inc., NY, USA).
Products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose
gel and stained with ethidium bromide. They were
visualized under UV light and digitalized by the image
analyzer software (EPI-Chemi Darkroom. UVP Labora-
tory Products, California, USA). Band profiles were
analyzed and compared visually. Each band was scored
as positive or negative for all isolates, and for each isolate,
the presence or absence of each band was registered. The
resulting matrix was interpreted using the Treecon
program, where isolates were grouped according to their
pattern resemblance. Based on matrix of similarity
coefficients (SC), a dendrogram was generated by the
unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages
(UPGMA). The criterion used for genotyping was as

follows: 2.5% from subjects with chronic periodontitis,
1.7% with gingivitis, and 0.4% from healthy individuals.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by using Statistix 7.0
and SPSS 11.0 versions. Confidence intervals (CI) were
calculated at 95% employing the Epi-Info 6.04 program
(Atlanta University, USA).

Results

Clinical features
The 240 subjects included in the study ranged in age from
18 to 75 years (mean age 37), 55% were females (132/240)
and had not received any antibacterial or antifungal
agents before sampling. Table 1 shows clinical period-
ontal parameters (PD and CAL Mean9SD) of subjects
at the time of sampling. Patients were classified into
groups according to the periodontal health status as
shown in Table 1: healthy (n53), gingivitis (n58), and
chronic periodontitis (n129). Gingivitis and chronic
periodontitis patients were BOP positive.

As expected, periodontitis sites showed significantly

patients.

The carriage of C. dubliniensis
Table 2 summarizes species distribution of yeast isolates
in the buccal cavity and the subgingival biofilm according
to the periodontal health status in 240 immunocompetent
individuals. The yeast microflora had similar species in
both studied sites (Table 2).

Out of the 203 recovered yeasts, C. albicans was the
most frequent species corresponding to 26.7% (64/240) in
the buccal cavity and 21.7% (52/240) in the subgingival
biofilm, as shown in Table 2.

C. dubliniensis was isolated in 4.2% (10/240) and 4.6%
(11/240) of patients in both niches, respectively. Distribu-
tion of C. dubliniensis isolates from the subingival biofilm
according to periodontal health status (Table 2), was as

RAPD-PCR assay
We selected five RAPD primers, based on their reprodu-
cibility, after pre-screening to analyze 21 isolates of C.
dubliniensis. The number of bands ranged from three
splitters (M13r) to 12 (M13f). Two of the five primers
were the most informative (M13f and OPC5) and they
generated the highest number of band patterns (between
10 and 12).

Fig. 1 shows the dendrogram of RAPD fingerprints of
C. dubliniensis isolates, the SC ranged from 50 to 100%.
Eight genetic clusters and five main genotypes were
obtained at an SC of 90%, genotypes I, II, III, IV, and
V, as shown in Fig. 1.

All

isolates unclustered or belonging to different
clusters by RAPD analysis were observed to differ by
three or more bands.

RAPD analysis showed identical genotypes of C.
dubliniensis in different sampling sites in eight of the 10
patients (buccal cavity and subgingival areas), except for
those observed in two participants. One case was patient
1, who presented presumably unrelated isolates (Fig. 1,
green arrows). The other patient, number 3 presented two
strains in subgingival biofilm (Cd3b and Cd3bb), which
represented genotype I and IV, respectively (Fig. 1).
Moreover, participant 3 presented a mouth C. dubliniensis
strain, Cd3a, which corresponded with genotype III (Fig.
1, red arrows). Those yeasts were presumably unrelated
isolates (20).

Discussion
C. dubliniensis is a yeast species that is characterized by
its in vitro resistance to the antifungal azole group in HIV
patients, for their capacity to adhere in vitro to human
buccal epithelial cells and other microorganisms in the
oral microbiota, as well as the high proteinase activity (9,
15, 37, 38). Originally, this species was isolated from
oropharyngeal candidiasis
in AIDS patients. Later,
numerous papers have been published indicating its

(healthy subjects and periodontitis patients).

In this study, C. dubliniensis showed a prevalence of
4.2% in the buccal mucosa from 240 patients. These
results do not match those found by other authors, who
found low prevalence of this species in healthy HIV-
negative patients (14, 44, 5153). This disagreement could

individuals with chronic periodontitis, compared to
healthy individuals and individuals with gingivitis, which
is not a statistical significant difference. Based on the
findings in this study, it is confirmed that C. dubliniensis
can colonize subgingival biofilm in immunocompetent
individuals with periodontal disease and healthy ones (6,
7). Similar findings have been reported by Song et al.,
since these authors found that C. dubliniensis dominated
among Candida species other than C. albicans, being most
prominent in periodontal pockets (54).

Others authors have not found C. dubliniensis in the

gingival sulcus in healthy individuals (4, 10, 11).

The RAPD-based typing was used to assess the
diversity of Candida species isolates, as it has been
described as a simple, rapid, and reliable discriminatory
method for clinical epidemiological
studies of oral
Candida infections (17, 23, 24, 27, 35). In spite of this,
and considering the reproducibility pitfalls of the RAPD
it was considered adequate to compare the
method,
reliability of
the RAPD-based clustering with that
obtained with pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis,
referred to as a more robust method (20, 23, 55).

In the present study,

the RAPD analysis showed
similar genotypes of C. dubliniensis in different sampling
sites from the same patient (buccal cavity and subgingival
areas), except for those observed in two patients (Fig. 1).
RAPD profiles of C. dubliniensis isolates from the
therefore almost

participants were generally distinct;
every individual harbored his/her own specific isolate.

Such genetic heterogeneity within isolates was reported
from other oral and non-oral sources in C. albicans (25,
26, 56).

These results led us to the conclusion that, the origin of
the colonization of C. dubliniensis in subgingival biofilm
seems to be the buccal cavity, consequently, it may be
assumed that most of C. dubliniensis in these sites arise
from endogenous commensal strains. As the only mode
of reproduction known for C. dubliniensis is asexual,
these results suggest a common clonal origin of isolates in
both niches (57).

In our series, C. dubliniensis genotypes had some
differences between oral and subgingival isolates in two
patients. Participants 1 and 3, harbored subgingival
strains genetically presumably unrelated, to the isolated
ones from their buccal cavity. Pizzo et al. (25) noted the
presence of a different C. albicans DNA type in
subgingival sites. This observation suggests that
the
presence of C. albicans or C. dubliniensis could also
occur due to the colonization with subgingivally adapted
strains, possibly as a result of genetic variations such as
gene conversion and/or chromosomal translations (19,
2527).

Similar C. dubliniensis genotypes may be distributed
among healthy and periodontal disease individuals,

Genetic relatedness of C. dubliniensis isolates by RAPD-PCR

as shown in Fig. 1, genotypes I, II, III, and V includ-
ed isolates from individuals that were healthy or had
periodontal disease. Therefore, a hypervirulent strain of
C. dubliniensis that is involved in disease patients should
be excluded. Other authors also observed that genetically
identical yeasts appeared in both healthy and diseased
subjects when they investigated C. albicans isolates (22,
25, 27).

To date, no studies have been aimed at genetic
characterization of subgingival C. dubliniensis isolates.
Therefore, our yeast isolates were subjected to RAPD-
PCR analysis, which has proved to be a rapid, simple,
cost-effective and discriminatory technique for molecular
typing of C. dubliniensis.

This is the first survey in Argentina to study the
molecular characterization of C. dubliniensis by RAPD-
PCR clinical isolates in different ecological niches of the
oral cavity. Such findings may be useful as baseline
information on subgingival C. dubliniensis colonization in
our country.
