On a global scale, crustal ﬂuids fuel a large part of the deep-subseaﬂoor biosphere by provid-
ing electron acceptors for microbial respiration. In this study, we examined bacterial cultures
from sediments of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, Northeast Paciﬁc (IODP Site U1301). The sedi-
ments comprise three distinctive compartments: an upper sulfate-containing zone, formed
by bottom-seawater diffusion, a sulfate-depleted zone, and a second (∼140 m thick) sulfate-
containing zone inﬂuenced by ﬂuid diffusion from the basaltic aquifer. In order to identify and
characterize sulfate-reducing bacteria, enrichment cultures from different sediment layers
were set up, analyzed by molecular screening, and used for isolating pure cultures.The ini-
tial enrichments harbored speciﬁc communities of heterotrophic microorganisms. Strains
afﬁliated to Desulfosporosinus lacus, Desulfotomaculum sp., and Desulfovibrio aespoeen-
sis were isolated only from the top layers (1.3–9.1 meters below seaﬂoor, mbsf), while
several strains of Desulfovibrio indonesiensis and a relative of Desulfotignum balticum
were obtained from near-basement sediments (240–262 mbsf). Physiological tests on
three selected strains afﬁliated to Dv. aespoeensis, Dv. indonesiensis, and Desulfotignum
balticum indicated that all reduce sulfate with a limited number of short-chain n-alcohols or
fatty acids and were able to ferment either ethanol, pyruvate, or betaine. All three isolates
shared the capacity of growing chemolithotrophically with H2 as sole electron donor. Strain
P23, afﬁliating with Dv. indonesiensis, even grew autotrophically in the absence of any
organic compounds.Thus, H2 might be an essential electron donor in the deep-subseaﬂoor
where the availability of organic substrates is limited.The isolation of non-sporeforming sul-
fate reducers from ﬂuid-inﬂuenced layers indicates that they have survived the long-term
burial as active populations even after the separation from the seaﬂoor hundreds of meters
above.

INTRODUCTION
The subseaﬂoor biosphere is probably the largest reservoir for
prokaryotic life on Earth (Whitman et al., 1998; Heberling et al.,
2010). It extends several hundred meters into deeply buried sed-
iments (Parkes et al., 1994; Roussel et al., 2008) and even further
down into the upper layers of the oceanic crust (Thorseth et al.,
1995; Furnes and Staudigel, 1999; Ehrhardt et al., 2007). Recently,
it was estimated that the ocean crust contains a similar amount of
microorganisms as the entire volume of the world’s oceans (Heber-
ling et al., 2010). The continuous circulation of seawater within
the upper crust turns these voluminous, porous, and permeable
basalts into the largest globally connected aquifer (Johnson and
Pruis, 2003; Johnson et al., 2006).

Intense ﬂuid circulation is a consequence of speciﬁc geological
settings evolved during crust formation at ocean-spreading cen-
ters. It is especially pronounced at ocean ridges such as the Juan
de Fuca Ridge in the Northeast Paciﬁc (Johnson et al., 2006). This
area is one of the most intensively studied locations in terms of
heat-driven ﬂuid ﬂow (Fisher et al., 2003; Hutnak et al., 2006).
While cold bottom-seawater is recharged at seamounts, it warms

up within the oceanic crust beneath the sediments before being
discharged again at other rocky outcrops exposed at the seaﬂoor.
The chemical composition of these low-temperature hydrother-
mal ﬂuids [<150˚C (Cowen, 2004)] is altered during long-term
circulation through the basalt due to continuous abiotic water–
rock interaction (Edwards et al., 2003) especially with increasing
basement temperature (Wheat and Mottl, 1994; Wheat et al.,
2000), or as a response to volcanic eruption (Butterﬁeld et al.,
1997). Additionally, microbial activity of crust-hosted commu-
nities contributes to changes in ﬂuid composition by removing
seawater constituents such as sulfate as indicated by sulfur-isotope
measurements (Rouxel et al., 2008). However, due to a limitation
in electron donors, crustal ﬂuids are not fully reduced and still
contain suitable electron acceptors, such as sulfate, for anaerobic
respiration (Wheat and Mottl, 1994; Wheat et al., 2000; Cowen
et al., 2003; Edwards et al., 2005).

It was postulated that basement ﬂuids not only supply electron
donors and acceptors to microbial life within the crust, but also
to the microbial communities in the overlying sediments by dif-
fusion from below (Cowen et al., 2003; DeLong, 2004; D’Hondt

Sulfate-reducing bacteria from the subseaﬂoor

et al., 2004). We tested this hypothesis during an expedition to
the eastern ﬂank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge (IODP Exp. 301) by
analyzing a 265-m-long sediment column of IODP site U1301.
Sampling included material taken only two meters above the
sediment–basement interface (Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005). At
this site, sulfate diffuses into the sediments from both the seaﬂoor
(∼27 mM) and the underlying basement (∼16 mM). As a pre-
condition for a sound microbiological and geochemical analysis,
contamination controls were performed directly onboard the drill-
ship JOIDES Resolution and proved the pristine character of the
sediment samples (Lever et al., 2006).

Our previous work has shown that ﬂuids from the oceanic crust
do support microbial life in the overlying sediments (Engelen et al.,
2008). Exoenzyme activities and sulfate reduction rates were not
only elevated near the seaﬂoor but also at the bottom of the sedi-
ment column which correlated well with the overall geochemical
settings. We detected enhanced microbial abundance in sediment
layers above the basement by direct counting and the cultivation-
based most probable number (MPN) technique. Microbial growth
in anoxic MPN dilution series from sediment layers near the
oceanic crust indicated considerable amounts of viable microbial
populations. Thus, the detection of a deep sulfate reduction zone
and the successful enrichment of anaerobic microorganisms was
the motivation for isolating sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) espe-
cially from ﬂuid-inﬂuenced sediment layers. Identifying deﬁned
physiological adaptations of indigenous microorganisms to envi-
ronmental conditions can be achieved best when pure cultures are
available.

Even though sulfate reduction is supposed to be an important
process in deeply buried sediments, only few isolates are available
in strain collections. The type strain of Desulfovibrio profundus
was isolated from 500 m depth in sediments of the Japan Sea
(Parkes et al., 1995; Bale et al., 1997). Other piezophilic isolates
closely related to Dv. profundus were cultivated from 222 m deep
sediments of the Cascadia margin of the Paciﬁc Ocean (Barnes
et al., 1998). However, cultivation-based studies on the marine
deep biosphere are still limited to a few sampling sites represent-
ing pinpricks in the ocean ﬂoor. So far, isolates from the marine
subsurface were obtained from sediment samples retrieved from
Mediterranean sediments (Süss et al., 2004) and from various sites
in the Paciﬁc Ocean: The Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan (Inagaki
et al., 2003), the Nankai Trough south–east of Japan (Mikucki et al.,
2003; Tofﬁn et al., 2004a,b, 2005; Kendall et al., 2006), the Equator-
ial Paciﬁc, and the Peru Margin (D’Hondt et al., 2004; Biddle et al.,
2005; Lee et al., 2005; Batzke et al., 2007). Recently, several het-
erotrophic bacteria and methanogenic Archaea were isolated from
up to 106 mbsf deep sediments off Shimokita Peninsula, Japan
using a continuous-ﬂow bioreactor (Imachi et al., 2011).

In this study, we extended our previous investigations on IODP
Site U1301 to determine the microbial diversity within different
sediment layers of the deep subsurface. We hypothesize, that zones
with different sulfate concentrations harbor different populations
of SRB due to varying substrate availabilities. A cultivation-based
approach in combination with molecular screening tools was cho-
sen to isolate and compare SRB from ﬂuid-inﬂuenced sediments
and near-surface layers. The metabolic properties of the isolates
might provide new insights on the impact of crustal ﬂuids on

microbial metabolism in the deep-subseaﬂoor biosphere where
substrates are recalcitrant but electron acceptors are still available.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE MATERIAL
Sediment samples were recovered from the eastern ﬂank of the
Juan de Fuca Ridge by the drill ship “JOIDES Resolution” dur-
ing IODP Expedition 301 in 2004. Characteristics of IODP Site
U1301 were described in the expedition report (Expedition 301
Scientists, 2005). Sediment sampling, contamination tests, and
subsampling for further analyses were described in detail by Enge-
len et al. (2008). All samples proved to be free of contamination as
previously described by Lever et al. (2006).

INITIAL ENRICHMENTS OF DEEP-BIOSPHERE BACTERIA
To elucidate the diversity of cultured bacteria, a total of 736 initial
enrichment cultures were set up directly onboard. Sediment slur-
ries from 17 representative depth intervals (Engelen et al., 2008)
were prepared immediately after sample recovery with anoxic arti-
ﬁcial seawater medium (Süss et al., 2004). MPN series for anoxic
and oxic microorganisms from these slurries were performed in
10-fold steps within 96-deep-well microtiter plates as previously
described (Engelen et al., 2008). In addition, liquid dilution series
in 20 ml-glass tubes were inoculated, ﬂushed with N2 and sealed
with butyl rubber stoppers. Anoxic substrate gradient tubes were
prepared with undisturbed 1-cm3-sediment subcores from hole
U1301C, only by embedding them within agar-solidiﬁed artiﬁ-
cial seawater media (Köpke et al., 2005). In general, a mixture
of the following substrates were supplied to stimulate micro-
bial growth: glycerol, glucose, lactate, fumarate, malate, succinate,
methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, formate, acetate, pro-
pionate, butyrate, valerate, caproate, and all the 20 l-amino acids
(ﬁnal concentration of each compound: 0.1 mM). For a better
comparison of all enrichments, incubation was performed at 20˚C.
Anoxic and oxic MPN viable counts were determined after
14 weeks of incubation to quantify the cultured part of the micro-
bial communities within the sampled sediment layers. Proce-
dure and results have already been published by Engelen et al.
(2008). For the present cultivation study, all dilution cultures
showing growth were transferred into 20 ml-glass tubes contain-
ing freshly prepared media and further incubated for at least
ﬁve months at 20˚C. Since cell densities were generally low, growth
was determined several times during incubation by epiﬂuores-
cence microscopy using Sybr®GreenI as a ﬂuorescent dye. Growth
of sulfate reducers was monitored by measuring the formation
of sulﬁde (Cord-Ruwisch, 1985). Gradient cultures were incu-
bated for approximately one year without interruption. Stimu-
lation of growth within the sediment subcore was analyzed by
microscopy and molecular methods. Finally, a total of 116 positive
cultures were analyzed by means of molecular biological methods
as described below to identify the cultivated microorganisms and
to select enrichments for further isolation processes.

ISOLATION OF PURE CULTURES
Pure cultures from SRB and other anaerobes were isolated
and maintained in a slightly different artiﬁcial seawater media.
One liter of this basal medium contained 24.32 g NaCl, 10.0 g

Sulfate-reducing bacteria from the subseaﬂoor

MgCl2·6H2O, 1.5 g CaCl2·2H2O, 4.0 g Na2SO4, 0.66 g KCl, and
0.09 g KBr. Resazurin (1 mg/l) was added as redox-indicator. The
media was autoclaved, cooled under a nitrogen atmosphere, and
supplemented with the following sterile solutions: NH4Cl (2 mM),
KH2PO4 (1 mM), CO2-saturated sodium bicarbonate (30 mM),
and from sterile stocks: 1 ml/l of trace element solution SL10 (Wid-
del and Bak, 1992) 0.2 ml/l of selenite-tungsten solution (Widdel
and Bak, 1992) and 2 ml/l of a solution of 10 vitamins (Balch et al.,
1979). The anoxic medium was reduced by addition of Na2S (ﬁnal
concentration: ∼1 mM) and few crystals of sodium dithionite. The
pH was adjusted to 7.2–7.5 with 4 M NaOH. To increase cell den-
sity of all subcultures, a 10-fold higher concentrated substrate mix
was provided (i.e., ﬁnal concentration of each compound: 1 mM).
Repeated application of the deep-agar dilution method (Widdel
and Bak, 1992) or dilution-to-extinction was performed to iso-
late deep-biosphere bacteria from liquid enrichments. Sediment
subcores from gradient cultures were homogenized and slurried
with 4 ml anoxic artiﬁcial seawater to further establish subcultures
−6). Aerobic microorganisms
as gradient dilution series (up to 10
were subcultured for isolation by the liquid dilution-to-extinction
method with subsequent puriﬁcation on agar plates using a
HEPES/bicarbonate-buffered oxic seawater medium. The purity
of all isolates was checked by microscopy and molecular analysis
as described below. Furthermore, the cultures were transferred to a
complex HEPES-buffered oxic seawater medium containing yeast
extract (0.03 g/l), glucose (1 mM), lactate (5 mM), and peptone
(0.06 g/l) as substrates to check for contamination.

MOLECULAR SCREENING OF ENRICHMENT CULTURES
The above described enrichment and isolation procedure was
monitored and directed by molecular screening to identify unique
phylotypes. Positive dilutions or growing colonies were ana-
lyzed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of 16S rRNA
gene-fragments, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE),
and subsequent sequencing of re-ampliﬁed DGGE bands. DNA
from liquid cultures was extracted using a protocol combin-
ing bead-beating with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol treat-
ment and isopropanol/sodium acetate precipitation (Stevens et al.,
2005). Nucleic acid extraction from substrate gradient cultures
was performed by using the UltraClean™Soil DNA Isolation Kit
(MoBio Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions.

Polymerase chain reaction-ampliﬁcation of bacterial 16S rRNA
genes was conducted in 50-μl volumes containing the following
components: 1–2 μl of DNA-template, 10 pmol of each primer,
0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.5–2 μl of bovine serum albumin (BSA,
10 mg/ml), 5 μl of 10×-ThermoPol reaction buffer and 1 U/μl of
Taq Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA)
and nuclease-free water. For DGGE analysis, the almost com-
plete 16S rRNA genes were ampliﬁed with the primer set 8f/1492r
(Overmann and Tuschak, 1997). The samples were incubated in
a thermal cycler (Mastercycler, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany)
under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95˚C for
5 min, 28 cycles of ampliﬁcation by denaturation at 95˚C for 30 s,
annealing at 40˚C for 60 s, and elongation at 72˚C for 3 min. Ter-
minal elongation was performed at 72˚C for 10 min. The resulting
amplicons were used as templates for a nested PCR. Shorter 16S

rRNA gene-fragments were ampliﬁed (Wilms et al., 2006a) using
the universal bacterial primer set GC-341f and 907r (Overmann
and Tuschak, 1997). All PCR products were always visualized by
agarose-gel electrophoresis (Wilms et al., 2006a). DGGE was per-
formed with a gradient from 40 to 70% (Süss et al., 2004). PCR
products were mixed with loading buffer before loading onto the
gel (Wilms et al., 2006a).

SEQUENCING OF DGGE BANDS AND PURE CULTURES
For sequence analysis of DGGE bands, distinctive bands were
excised, eluted in 50 μl nuclease-free water, re-ampliﬁed in a 25-μl-
PCR (primers 341f/907r, Wilms et al., 2006b), and puriﬁed (Wilms
et al., 2006a) using the QIAquick PCR puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen
GmbH, Hilden, Germany) or the PCR-Purifying-Kit (SeqLab, Göt-
tingen, Germany) and sequenced with a IRDyeTM800 labeled
907r-primer (Süss et al., 2004). For phylogenetic identiﬁcation
of pure cultures, genomic DNA was extracted from the isolated
strains using a freeze and thaw procedure. From picked colonies
or 2 ml of liquid cultures, 1 μl of a cell pellet was resuspended
with 100 μl of ﬁlter-sterilized Tris-buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The
suspension was frozen at −80˚C for 3 min and heated at 85˚C
for 3 min. This procedure was repeated ﬁve times, and 2 μl of
the ﬁnal extract were added to 48 μl of PCR mixture. Partial
or nearly full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were
ampliﬁed using the bacteria-speciﬁc primer set 341f/907r and
8f/1492r, respectively, and sequenced as described above. In case
of sulfate-reducing strains, DNA was sequenced in both direc-
tions using the respective PCR primers and the service of GATC
Biotech AG (Konstanz, Germany). Consensus sequences were con-
structed after alignment by using the BioEdit software tool version
7.0.91. All 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained in this study were
compared for their afﬁliation to the closest relatives using the
BLASTN program 2.2.26+ (Altschul et al., 1990; Morgulis et al.,
2008)2. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of all 40 isolates
are deposited in GenBank database under the accession numbers
JQ411257–JQ411296.

PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF SULFATE-REDUCING
ISOLATES
Physiological tests were generally performed in sealed glass tubes
containing 10 ml of artiﬁcial seawater medium. Sulﬁdogenic
growth was tested with 18 different substrates at ﬁnal concen-
trations between 1 and 5 mM in the presence of sulfate. Fermen-
tative growth with betaine, ethanol, malate, or pyruvate (2–5 mM,
each) was tested in medium without additional electron accep-
tors. The cultures were incubated for at least 4 weeks at 20˚C in
the dark. Chemolithotrophic growth with H2 as electron donor
was tested with a headspace (2/3 of the culture volume) ﬁlled
with a mixture of H2/CO2 (80/20 v/v, 1 kPa). Those cultures were
incubated horizontally at 20˚C. Growth was checked by visual
inspection of turbidity, by phase contrast microscopy, and by sul-
ﬁde formation (Cord-Ruwisch, 1985). Substrate utilization was
deﬁned to be positive after the third successful transfer into fresh
media.

Sulfate-reducing bacteria from the subseaﬂoor

The capability of anaerobic respiration was tested in sulfate-free
medium with ethanol or lactate (5 mM, each) as electron donor
in combination with six different electron acceptors. Reduction of
Fe(III) was indicated by the formation of black precipitates under
the expense of the reddish ferric hydroxide. Mn(IV) utilization was
shown by the disappearance of brown manganese carbonates and
the occurrence of white precipitates. The production of sulﬁde as
a result of the reduction of thiosulfate or sulﬁte was measured at
480 nm using a Shimadzu UV-1202 photometer (Cord-Ruwisch,
1985). In addition, cultures were checked microscopically for the
presence of bacterial cells.

Growth experiments for autotrophic growth were performed at
35˚C, the optimum temperature for growth of our test strain P23.
Growth rates were calculated from linear regression of produced
sulﬁde (Cord-Ruwisch, 1985) and formed cell protein (Bradford,
1976) as function of time.

The temperature range for growth of SRB was tested from
4 to 55˚C with lactate (10 mM) as electron donor. Growth was
followed at OD436 via sulﬁde production and by photometrical
determination of protein concentrations (Bradford, 1976).

For phase contrast microscopy, agarose-coated slides were used.
To prepare those, slides were thoroughly cleaned and preheated by
infrared light in order to get a smooth agarose ﬁlm. Then, 1 ml
of the hot agarose solution (2% w/v) was dispensed on the warm
slides. Before usage, the agarose slides were air dried. Upon placing
a drop of a bacterial culture to a coated slide, the liquid diffuses
into the dry agarose, while the cells are gently squeezed under the
cover slip and get ﬁxed in the same plane. Cell dimensions were
determined using a Leitz DMRB microscope (Wetzlar, Germany).
Transmission-electron microscopy was performed as follows: a
400-mesh Formvar copper grid (Plano) was placed on a drop of
cell suspension for 10 min. Cells adsorbed to the grid were stained
with 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 min, washed twice in a drop
of water for a few seconds and examined with a transmission-
electron microscope (EM 902A, Zeiss). A Proscan High Speed
SSCCD camera system with iTEMﬁve software was used for images
acquisition.

RESULTS
GEOCHEMICAL PROFILES DIVIDE THE SEDIMENT COLUMN INTO THREE
DISTINCTIVE ZONES
The geomorphological structure of the eastern ﬂank of the Juan
de Fuca Ridge leads to a hydrological situation where sulfate-
containing ﬂuids from the oceanic crust diffuse ∼140 m into
overlying sediment layers. The effect of this heat-driven ﬂuid
circulation was reﬂected by the temperature gradient within the
sediments of 2˚C at the seaﬂoor to approximately 62˚C above the
basement (Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005). Using the porewater
proﬁle of sulfate, the sediment column can be separated into three
zones (Figure 1). The upper sulfate-containing zone was formed
by bottom-seawater diffusion showing decreasing concentrations
from 27 mM at the top to 3 mM in 35 mbsf. Below, a sulfate-
depleted zone was located between 47 and 121 mbsf (<1 mM).
The lower sulfate-containing zone was characterized by increasing
sulfate concentrations from 2 to 16 mM toward the basement at
∼265 mbsf due to sulfate diffusion from crustal ﬂuid ﬂow into the
overlying sediments.

SHIFTS IN MICROBIAL DIVERSITY BETWEEN THE INITIAL ENRICHMENT
CULTURES FROM THE DIFFERENT ZONES
Anoxic and oxic MPN series, liquid dilution series in tubes and
the substrate gradient technique were used to enrich and fur-
ther isolate deep-biosphere bacteria. The cultivation progress was
monitored by microscopy and PCR–DGGE. Unique DGGE bands
were subsequently sequenced to identify the community compo-
sition within the enrichments. A total of 135 partial 16S rRNA
gene sequences were obtained after DGGE analysis of growing
cultures. The technique was not only chosen to prevent multi-
ple isolation of one strain and to check the purity of cultures,
but also to identify community members that could not be iso-
lated. This molecular-directed cultivation indicated the presence
of diverse viable microbial populations within the different zones
of the investigated sediment column.

The phylogenetic screening of the initial enrichments identi-
ﬁed different bacterial populations among the growing cultures
obtained from the three sediment zones (Figure 1). A typical
decrease in cultivation success with respect to the conditions set
in our growth media was observed for the two upper zones, which
correlates with the general depletion of electron donors and accep-
tors. Within the top 30 m of the sediment column, 35 different
operational taxonomic units (OTUs, deﬁned at 97% sequence
similarity) were detected via PCR–DGGE in enrichments from
the respective sediment layers. From the sulfate-depleted zone, 21
OTUs were retrieved. For samples from the deep, ﬂuid-inﬂuenced
sediment zone, the cultivation success increased again with 48
identiﬁed OTUs.

In general, the number of OTUs belonging to the Firmicutes
decreased with sediment depth from 60% in enrichments from
the upper sulfate-containing zone to 21% in the lower sulfate
zone. In addition, Gammaproteobacteria accounted for 40% of
all OTUs retrieved from enrichments of the lower sulfate zone.
Bacteria belonging to the phylum Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and
the classes Beta- and Epsilonproteobacteria were enriched as iden-
tiﬁed by molecular methods but could not be isolated or were lost
during puriﬁcation procedures. The majority of the enriched but
not isolated organisms were phylogenetically afﬁliated to uncul-
tured bacteria from different terrestrial and marine environments
(data not shown in detail).

DIVERSITY OF ISOLATED PURE CULTURES
From the 116 initial enrichments that were tested positively for
growth, 40 strains could be isolated (14 from the upper sulfate-
containing zone, 8 from the sulfate-depleted zone, and 18 from
the lower sulfate-containing zone). Based on 16S rRNA gene
sequences, the 40 pure cultures could be afﬁliated to the phyla
Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Tenericutes or the classes Alphapro-
teobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria (Table 1).
The majority of isolates (32 of 40) were obtained from liquid
dilution series that were initially inoculated with hundred to
−6), indicating a sig-
million fold diluted sediment (10
niﬁcant number of cells in situ. Nearly all isolates were closely
related to cultivated species from sediments or soils, ﬂuids, or
other aquatic environments. Among them, 13 were strict anaer-
obes. With exception of the sporeforming Firmicutes all other
pure cultures including those obtained from oxic media were

considered to be facultatively anaerobic, since they originated from
anoxic sediment horizons. While some isolates seem to be ubiqui-
tous within the sediment column [e.g., Shewanella frigidimarina,
98–99% sequence similarity or Bacillus spp. (96–100%)], others
were retrieved from single sediment layers, only (e.g., Anaerovir-
gula multivorans or Marinobacter ﬂavimaris, both 99% sequence
similarity).

SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA WERE ISOLATED FROM BOTH
SULFATE-CONTAINING ZONES
The sulfate reducers isolated from the upper 10 m predominantly
belonged to the Firmicutes (Figures 1 and 2; Table 1). Three strains
were identiﬁed as members of the genera Desulfotomaculum and
Desulfosporosinus. The latter shared 97% sequence similarity with
its closest described relative Desulfosporosinus lacus, ﬁrstly iso-
lated from freshwater lake sediments (Ramamoorthy et al., 2006).
The Desulfotomaculum strains were phylogenetically related to
isolates originally obtained from a terrestric aquifer system (Det-
mers et al., 2001). Another isolate from a near-surface layer
(strain P20) was closely afﬁliated to Desulfovibrio aespoeensis.
This Deltaproteobacterium was also enriched in co-culture with
strains related to Desulfovibrio indonesiensis (culture P34 and P19)
from 240 and 260 mbsf, respectively, as identiﬁed by DGGE and

subsequent sequencing of the bands. Two sequences afﬁliated to
sulfate reducers were also detected in enrichment cultures from
sediments of the sulfate-depleted zone (Figure 1). However, no
isolates could be retrieved. SRB isolated from the deepest sedi-
ments above the basement solely belonged to the Deltaproteobac-
teria, namely Desulfotignum balticum (strain P18; 260 mbsf) and
Dv. indonesiensis (strains P12, P19-1, P23, P33, and P34). The lat-
ter phylotype was highly abundant in the lower sulfate-containing

layers (240, 252, 260 mbsf). Furthermore, strains P18, P23, and
P34 were isolated from million fold diluted MPN-cultures, allow-
ing the assumption, that they must be present in higher numbers
within the respective sediment layer, where they probably play an
active role.

MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THREE
REPRESENTATIVE SULFATE-REDUCING ISOLATES
Strains afﬁliated to Dv. aespoeensis (strain P20), Dv. indonesien-
sis (strain P23), and Desulfotignum balticum (strain P18) were
morphologically and physiologically investigated in more detail
(Figure 2; Table 2). Strain P20 was used for further analysis since
it was the only available pure culture related to Dv. aespoeensis
that was obtained in this study. Other relatives of this species were

the two species failed. Strain P23, obtained from the deepest sed-

related to Dv. indonesiensis, since the other closely related iso-
lates showed nearly identical characteristics under the growth

Sulfate-reducing bacteria from the subseaﬂoor

DISCUSSION
ORGANIC MATTER AND SULFATE AVAILABILITY GENERATE THE THREE
DIFFERENT ZONES OF THE SEDIMENT COLUMN
The stratiﬁcation of the different sediment compartments has
an imprint on the life conditions. In both, the seawater- and
ﬂuid-inﬂuenced layers, the availability of electron acceptors stimu-
lates microbial growth and activity of indigenous microorganisms
(Engelen et al., 2008). In terms of electron donors, bacteria that
thrive in the upper 30 m of the sediments are supported by bur-
ial of relatively young organic carbon (Fisher et al., 2003; Johnson
et al., 2006). Therefore, they are used to a higher supply of electron
donors and adapt much better to the given cultivation condi-
tions. In deeper sediment horizons, indigenous bacteria have to
survive long-term burial by adapting to a minimum supply of sub-
strates and electron acceptors. Their limited availability strongly
inﬂuences the metabolic activities in the deep marine subsurface.
Indeed, based on geochemical porewater proﬁles, it has been con-
cluded that the metabolic activities of subseaﬂoor prokaryotes
are very low (D’Hondt et al., 2002, 2004). They probably have
developed different life strategies such as slow growth or survival as
spores. The latter were presumably stimulated to germinate during
our cultivation experiments since a major part of 16S rRNA gene
sequences detected in all enrichment cultures afﬁliated to spore-
forming Firmicutes (Figure 1). However, the decreasing number
of Firmicutes with depth indicates that not all of them survive
the long-term burial as spores as they might have germinated
stochastically over geological time scales (Epstein, 2009).

Other subsurface organisms that are adapted to low organic
carbon concentrations might not be able to grow under the given
laboratory conditions. Even though the composition of our cul-
ture media was designed to provide organic substrates in sub-
millimolar concentrations, a substrate shock (Straskrabová, 1983)
might not have been circumvented. For instance, we were not
able to grow any Archaea (data not shown) even though they are
proposed to represent a substantial part of the deep biosphere as
indicated by intact-lipid analysis (Lipp et al., 2008).

The supply of electron acceptors into the sediment column
by crustal ﬂuid diffusion dramatically changes the situation for
microbial life within these deeply buried layers. The large numbers
of non-sporeforming Gammaproteobacteria that were enriched
from near-basement layers indicate the presence of viable cells.
Many Gammaproteobacteria are adapted to elevated substrate con-
centrations (Lauro et al., 2009) and are therefore readily cultivated
using our media. Some of them might even be typical for oceanic
ridge systems. Halomonas and Marinobacter species were found
to be present in hydrothermal ﬂuids collected at the Juan de Fuca
Ridge (Kaye et al., 2011). They were enriched during in situ col-
onization experiments on basaltic crust (Smith et al., 2011) and
have also been detected in basaltic seaﬂoor lavas and overlying
seawater at the East Paciﬁc Rise (Santelli et al., 2008).

THE UPPER AND LOWER SULFATE-CONTAINING ZONES HARBOR
DIFFERENT SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA
The majority of sequences obtained from upper sediment horizons
that were afﬁliated to SRB have Desulfosporosinus and Desulfo-
tomaculum species as closest relatives, both sporeforming Firmi-
cutes. However, it is unclear if they contribute to the high sulfate

respectively, with the optimal growth temperature lying between
25 and 35˚C.

All strains were capable of using sulﬁte or thiosulfate as alter-
native electron acceptor other than sulfate. Slow growth by iron or
manganese reduction on lactate was observed for Desulfotignum
balticum strain P18 and Dv. indonesiensis strain P23. Growth was
not as fast as with sulfate as electron acceptor and high cell densi-
ties were not achieved. However, growth on metal oxides occurred
even after the third transfer. None of the strains used nitrate as
electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration.

Of all substrates provided, Dv. aespoeensis strain P20 only uti-
lized lactate and formate for growth in the presence of sulfate. In
contrast, the type strain of Dv. aespoeensis only grew on lactate
as sole substrate (Motamedi and Pedersen, 1998). The two other
strains tested (P18 and P23) showed a slightly broader substrate
spectrum. Strain P23, for instance, grew on different n-alcohols
(C2–C4), formate, fumarate, lactate, and pyruvate. Only Desul-
fotignum strain P18 grew on acetate, benzoate, betaine, butyrate,
and succinate, whereas fast growth and high cell densities were
achieved with betaine, which was also fermented. Fermentative
growth with pyruvate occurred in Desulfovibrio strains, only. All
strains used hydrogen as electron donor. Desulfotignum balticum
strain P18 grew autotrophically but only in the presence of vita-
mins. This was already known for the type strain of Desulfotignum
balticum, which was described to grow on H2 and CO2 (Kuever
et al., 2001). Surprisingly, autotrophic growth for Dv. indonesien-
sis strain P23 was observed in media that did not contain any
organic additives such as vitamins, resazurin, or yeast extract and
after at least 10 transfers to eliminate carbon sources from initial
cultures (Figure 3). Growth rates (based on protein production)

for strain P23 were 0.12 d

reduction rates of up to 8 nmol cm-3 d-1 determined for the upper
sulfate-containing zone of IODP Site U1301 (Engelen et al., 2008).
This would only be the case if these SRB are present as viable cells.
It cannot be speciﬁed if they are metabolically active or if they only
survive as spores within these layers.

In contrast, ﬂuid-inﬂuenced sediments exclusively harbor sul-
fate reducers that are members of the Deltaproteobacteria, which
are not known to form any resting stages. These viable popula-
tions contribute to sulfate reduction rates of up to 3 pmol cm-3 d-1
within the lower sulfate reduction zone (Engelen et al., 2008). Due
to their high abundance, this activity might derive from sulfate

reducers afﬁliated to Dv. indonesiensis. This is quite surprising
since the in situ temperature is around 60˚C and most Desul-
fovibrio species are not active above 40˚C (Widdel and Bak, 1992).
However, a broad temperature range of growth was not only found
for our isolates, but also for the Japan Sea isolates of Dv. profun-
dus (Bale et al., 1997) and might represent an adaptation to the
conditions in the deep biosphere.

Thus, one reason for the divergence in the SRB communities
detected in both sulfate-containing zones might be the different
temperature and pressure regimes present at the top and bot-
tom of the sediment column. Surprisingly, the isolates from the

sulfate reducer within formation waters of deep terrestrial bore-
holes at the Aespoe hard rock laboratory in Sweden (Motamedi
and Pedersen, 1998). Those aquifers are also inhabited by com-
plex microbial communities that are comparable to those thriving
within the ocean crust (Pedersen, 2000). The energetical constrains
are similar and select for, e.g., iron-reducing bacteria, acetogens,
methanogens, and sulfate reducers (Pedersen, 1997).

Our most frequently isolated strains from up to 260 m deep
ﬂuid-inﬂuenced sediments that are afﬁliated to Dv. indonesien-
sis also have close relatives within the deep terrestrial biosphere.
Even though the type strain was originally isolated from a bioﬁlm
on a corroded ship off the Indonesian coast (Feio et al., 1998,
2000), relatives were obtained from porewater brines of a deep
terrestrial gas-reservoir (Sass and Cypionka, 2004). Furthermore,
these organisms are supposedly involved in iron corrosion as deter-
mined during a study on hydrogen-consuming microorganisms in
oil facilities from Japan (Mori et al., 2010). Biocorrosive capabili-
ties (Feio et al., 1998) of Dv. indonesiensis might be an indication
for a crustal origin of this species as this process plays an impor-
tant role in the weathering of basalts (Edwards et al., 2005).
Under anoxic conditions, SRB, and especially Desulfovibrio species
are responsible for the corrosion of metal surfaces in consum-
ing cathodic hydrogen (Pankhania, 1988; Dinh et al., 2004). This
process might occur in the habitat as well as in our metabolic tests.
As all isolates deriving from the ﬂuid-inﬂuenced zone were capa-
ble of using hydrogen as electron donor, they might even exhibit a
chemolithoautotrophic life-mode in situ.

CHEMOLITHOAUTOTROPHY WITHIN THE DEEP BIOSPHERE
Autotrophic, hydrogen-consuming microorganisms were repeat-
edly detected in deep continental aquifers and can even outnumber
heterotrophs (Stevens and McKinley, 1995). The assumption that
autotrophy is also a common metabolic attribute within the crust
at IODP Site U1301, is supported by the isolation of a novel mem-
ber of the genus Archaeoglobus from a ﬂuid-inﬂuenced sample of
ODP Site 1226 (Steinsbu et al., 2010). Archaeoglobus sulfaticallidus
sp. nov., is a thermophilic and facultatively lithoautotrophic sul-
fate reducer and was isolated from black rust formations on top of
a leaking borehole seal.

Although there is no clear evidence available for lithoautotro-
phy within the subseaﬂoor (Stevens, 1997), there are numerous
studies that deal with hydrogen as suitable source for deep sub-
surface life. In these habitats, hydrogen can originate from many
sources (Nealson et al., 2005) such as the fermentation of organic
matter or mechanochemical processes due to the tectonic action
of the Earth (Parkes et al., 2011), degassing from the Earth’s mantle
during serpentinization of ultramaﬁc rocks (McCollom and Bach,
2009), or even by radiolysis of water (Blair et al., 2007; D’Hondt
et al., 2009). Furthermore, in the presence of sulfate, the oxidation
of hydrogen is thermodynamically favored at high temperatures
(Orcutt et al., 2010).

Thus, in many deep subsurface habitats, hydrogen might
become apparently the biochemically most important electron
donor and carbon dioxide is a ubiquitous carbon source. For
example, both gases were found in micro-molar concentrations in
deep igneous-rock aquifers (Pedersen, 1997) and deep aquifers of
the Columbia river basalt which is located close to our investigated

deepest ﬂuid-inﬂuenced layers did not grow at in situ temperatures
of approximately 60˚C. This might be due to the chosen initial
incubation conditions at 20˚C and ambient hydrostatic pressure
instead of the in situ pressure of ∼30 MPa. As temperature and
pressure counteract on the cell membrane composition (Mangels-
dorf et al., 2005), an insufﬁcient combination of both parameters
might result in membrane disintegration. This assumption is sup-
ported by the fact that no isolates were obtained from enrichment
cultures that were incubated under in situ temperatures (data not
shown). In future experiments, pressure incubations might help
to overcome such problems in cultivation efﬁciencies.

SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA FROM THE LOWER ZONE HAVE
RELATIVES IN DEEP TERRESTRIAL AQUIFERS
Previous microbiological investigations on crustal ﬂuids from the
Juan de Fuca Ridge have identiﬁed several isolates (Nakagawa
et al., 2006) and 16S rRNA clones (Cowen et al., 2003; Huber
et al., 2006) that were afﬁliated to SRB. In general, the overlap
between these studies compared with our culture collection from
ﬂuid-inﬂuenced sediments is quite low. Only relatives of Desul-
fotomaculum and Desulfonatronovibrio species were detected in
two studies on the adjacent ODP Site 1026. One 16S rRNA gene
sequence that is afﬁliated to Desulfobacterium species was found
in ﬂuids that discharge at “Baby bare seamount.” A possible expla-
nation for this discrepancy might be that most of our isolates
represent typical sediment inhabitants, which do not necessarily
occur in the upper oceanic crust. However, our Deltaproteobacteria
that were isolated from the lower sulfate-containing zone are fac-
ing similar physico-chemical conditions in the highly compacted
sediments above the basement as in the crustal aquifer.

A close relation of deep marine with terrestrial aquifers is
indicated by the cultivation of Dv. aespoeensis strains from the
ﬂuid-inﬂuenced layers. Dv. aespoeensis is the most abundant

Sulfate-reducing bacteria from the subseaﬂoor

site (Stevens and McKinley, 1995). For both sites, the authors have
proposed a model for a hydrogen-driven biosphere. They assume
autotrophic acetogens to form acetate from hydrogen and car-
bon dioxide. Acetoclastic methanogens can utilize acetate to pro-
duce methane or hydrogenotrophic methanogens might directly
use hydrogen and CO2. At relatively young ridge-ﬂank systems,
hydrogen-utilizing sulfate reducers will outcompete methanogens
as sulfate is still available within the ﬂuids.

CONCLUSION
Even though cultivation might not cover the whole microbial
diversity of a given habitat, we were able to isolate and physiologi-
cally characterize indigenous microorganisms that are numerically
and metabolically important for the marine deep subsurface. Thus,
cultivation-based studies offer the opportunity to complement
molecular techniques. In our study, the isolation of SRB from
deep sediment layers was the precondition to answer questions
concerning speciﬁc metabolic adaptations to the conditions at the
sediment–basement interface.

The isolation of facultatively autotrophic sulfate reducers from
near-basement layers strongly suggests that these organisms sur-
vive due to their capability of consuming hydrogen after organic
compounds have been depleted or become too recalcitrant for
microbial degradation. The continuous supply of sulfate from
the aquifer below supports their viability within their respec-
tive sediment layers even after the separation from organic matter
input at the seaﬂoor due to sediment accumulation. When organic
substrate availability from the ocean becomes a limiting factor,
hydrogen becomes the most important electron donor.
