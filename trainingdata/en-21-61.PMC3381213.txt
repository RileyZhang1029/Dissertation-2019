Primary dissociated neuronal cultures are widely used research tools to investigate of pathological mechanisms and to treat various 
central and peripheral nervous system problems including trauma and degenerative neuronal diseases. We introduced a protocol 
that utilizes hippocampal and cortical neurons from embryonic day 17 or 18 mice. We applied appropriate markers (GAP-43 and 
synaptophysin) to investigate whether neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis can be distinguished at a particular period of time. 
GAP-43 was found along the neural processes in a typical granular pattern, and its expression increased proportionally as neurites 
lengthened during the early in vitro period. Unlike GAP-43, granular immunoreactive patterns of synaptophysin along the neurites 
were clearly found from day 2 in vitro with relatively high immunoreactive levels. Expression of synaptic markers from cortical 
neurons reached peak level earlier than that of hippocampal neurons, although neurite outgrowths of hippocampal neurons were 
faster than those of cortical neurons. Th  e amount of peak synaptic markers expressed was also higher in cortical neurons than that 
in hippocampal neurons. Th  ese results strongly suggest the usefulness of primary cultured neurons from mice embryos for synaptic 
function and plasticity studies, because of their clear and typical patterns of morphology that establish synapses. Results from 
this study also suggest the proper amount of time in vitro according to neuronal types (cortical or hippocampal) when utilized in 
experiments related with synaptogenesis or synaptic activities.

INTRODUCTION

Primary neural cultures allow continuous visual access for 
morphological studies such as neurite sprouting, connectivity, and 
variability. These cultures make individual living cells accessible 
to apply chemical or pharmacological agents and patch clamp 
recording [1-3], which are diffi  cult tasks to perform in a sectioned

slice alone. Individual neuronal activity of multiple neurons can 
be recorded for several weeks, which is extremely difficult to 
perform in a sectioned slice. Additionally, the relative proportions 
of neurons and neuroglial cells can be controlled, and different 
patterns of neuronal connectivity are beginning to be studied 
with developments in culture substrates. Th  us, primary neuronal 
culture is an important research tool that can be applied on a 
cell-by-cell basis to morphological and physiological studies of a 
variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampal 
formation, basal ganglia, and the diencephalon. In primary 
neuronal cultures, newly formed neurons undergo a series of 
extensive morphological changes as they mature, including neurite

sprouting and outgrowth, neurite branching, and establishment 
of synaptogenesis. Although insufficient, these morphological 
changes are necessary for the formation of neural network circuits 
facilitating neuronal functions [4]. 
Several researchers have adopted various substrates and methods 
for primary neuronal or neural stem cell cultures to stimulate 
and enhance neurite outgrowth. Positively charged hydrogels 
were used as substrates for nerve cell attachment and neurite 
outgrowth in rat primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures 
[5]. Thermoresponsive hydrogel scaffolds have been introduced 
into primary embryonic cortical neuron cultures to repair spinal 
cord injuries [6]. Artificial scaffolds have been investigated as 
a means of addressing axonal regeneration inhibiting stimuli 
[7, 8] such as glial scars [9, 10] or inhibiting molecules [11]. 
Most recently, a three-dimensional microfluidic device showed 
dissociated cortical neurons cultured in three-dimensional multi-
layered scaffolds based on an agarose-alginate mixture for the 
fi rst time [12]. Primary cultures off er an opportunity to visualize 
neurite outgrowth or synaptogenesis at the level of single cells, 
and modern immunofluorescent methods are frequently used 
for this purpose. Because it is inevitable that cells are grown on 
glass cover slips to prevent quenching or autofl uorescence, cover 
slips must be coated for successful cell attachment and growth. 
Various compounds, such as poly-l-lysine (PLL), laminin, or 
poly-l-ornithine have been used for coating [13-15]. Here, we 
introduce culturing primary cortical and hippocampal neural 
cells isolated from embryonic mice on cover slips coated with a 
soluble basement membrane (Matrigel), which contains laminin, 
collagen IV, heparin sulfate, proteoglycans, entactin, and nidogen 
[16]. Because dissociated hippocampal or cortical cell cultures 
are composed of neurons and glial cells, strongly proliferating 
astrocytes will displace the non-proliferating neurons. Thus, we 
have added cytostatic drugs, such as cytosine arabinoside (AraC) 
to growing cells [17-19]. 
A variety of markers are used widely to detect core matter and 
core factor during neurite sprouting and outgrowth as well as 
synaptogenesis. Many researchers who study synapse formation 
have selected better substances such as axonal membrane protein 
(GAP-43), synaptophysin, and synapsin [20, 21]. GAP-43 is a 
phosphoprotein of the nerve terminal membrane that has been 
linked to the development and restructuring of axons [22]. Recent 
studies have shown that GAP-43 is not only related to an increase 
in synapse formation and synaptic plasticity in mice or rat primary 
neuronal cultures [23], but it is as also a significant substance 
for neurite outgrowth as shown by a morphological study with 
primary neuronal cultures from human fetal forebrain [24]. 
Moreover, GAP-43 reduction is associated with stress and aging 

in brain [25-27]. Synaptophysin is one of the synaptic vesicular 
proteins that has recently been characterized for the fi rst time [28] 
and has four transmembrane domains including synaptogyrin 
and synaptoporin [29]. It has been suggested that synaptophysin 
promotes the formation of highly curved membranes such as 
synaptic vesicles [30]. An ultra-structural study demonstrated 
that synaptophysin forms a structure similar to connexons [31]. 
Synaptophysin was recently reported to regulate the kinetics of 
synaptic vesicular endocytosis in neurons [32].
In this study, we focused on neurite outgrowth and synaptogenic 
activity using immunofluorescence and Western blotting 
with synaptogenic markers during the early period of in vitro 
culture. We aimed to demonstrate whether the patterns of 
neurite outgrowth were consistent with the expression levels 
of neurite outgrowth and synaptogenic markers by comparing 
morphological findings with those of Western blotting. Data 
from this study will be a useful reference for many primary 
neuronal culture protocols, because the primary culture system 
used in this study is a feasible in vitro model for a wide variety of 
neurophysiological and neuropharmacological applications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Primary neural cell culture
We used C57/BL6 mouse strain for primary neural culture. 
Embryonic day 16 to 18 embryos were obtained from surgically 
sacrificed pregnant mouse and separated cerebral cortex and 
hippocampus under surgical stereomicroscope. Separated 
tissues were trypsinized (5 mg/ml) for 10 min in 37oC. Finally, 
dissociated neurons were cultured on Matrigel (BD Science) 
coated 12 mm coverslips (total 12 coverslips per cortex or 
hippocampus). Number of total plated cell was adjusted at around 
100,000 per each coverslip. Culture media was prepared based 
on MEM (minimum essential media) We added glucose (5 gm/
l), transferrin (0.1 gm/l), insulin (0.25 gm/l), glutamine (0.3 gm/
l), heat-inactivated FBS (5~10%) and B-27 supplement (2%) to 
MEM as supplements. Culture media was changed only two 
times in day 1 and day 4 through all in vitro period. At the time of 
media change, only half of the media was removed and replaced 
with same amount of fresh media. To inhibit glial cell outgrowth, 
cytosine arabinoside (1 μM) was added at the moment of media 
change.

Immuno-fl uorescence staining (GAP-43 & Synaptophysin)
Cover slips those scheduled to be used for immune-fl uorescence 
staining were transferred into 4-well plates in day 2, day 4, and 
day 8 in vitro respectively. First, cultured neurons were fixed

with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 10 min and washed with DPBS 3 
times for 5 min. Nonspecific reactivity was blocked by adding 
1% Bovine serum albumin (BSA) into the primary antibody 
diluting solution. We used GAP-43 (1:1,000, ab7462, ABCAM) 
and synaptophysin (1:1,000, ab14692, ABCAM) as primary 
antibody of axonal growth marker and incubated for 24 hrs in 4oC. 
After the termination of primary antibody reaction, cover slips 
were washed with DPBS 3 times for 5 min and incubated with 
fluorescence tagged secondary antibody (Alexa 555, goat anti-
rabbit IgG, A21424, Invitrogen) for 90 min in RT. Cover slips were 
washed again 3 times for 5 min aft er the termination of secondary 
antibody incubation. Finally, nuclei of cultured neurons were 
counter-stained with DAPI (ABBOT Molecular) and immediately 
investigated under laser confocal microscope system.

Confocal microscopy
Confocal microscope (LSM-700 Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped 
with associated soft ware of ZEN2009 (version 5,5,0,375 Carl Zeiss, 
Germany) was used for the analysis of GAP-43 and synaptophysin 
immunofl uorescence staining. We set up the standard master gain 
of DAPI fi xation of 700 (GAP-43 & synaptophysin), master gain 
of rhodamin fi xation of 619 (GAP-43) and 700 (synaptophysin), 
digital gain below 1 and pinhole below 5. 

Western blotting
Cultured neurons were extracted from coverlslips in each 
wells and homogenized with 5X sample buffer (250 mM Tris-
HCl pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 5% beta-mecaptoethanol, 0.02% 
bromophenol blue, 10% SDS). After SDS-PAGE, transferred 
membranes were blocked by 5% skim milk for 30 minutes at RT. 
For primary antibody reactions, Anti-GAP43 (1:2,000, ab7462, 
rabbit polyclonal, Abcam) and anti-synaptophysin (1:1,000, 
ab14692, rabbit polyclonal, Abcam) were added to membranes 
and stayed overnight at 4oC on orbital shaker. Anti-beta actin 
(1:3,000, ab8227, rabbit polyclonal, Abcam) was also added to the 
membranes as loading controls for 1 hour at RT. Aft er the reaction 
with goat anti-rabbit (1:3,000, 111-036-003, Jackson) for 1 hour 
at RT, signals were enhanced by ECL (MC154418, Thermo) 
solutions. Bands were detected by the image detection system (LAS 
4000, GE). 

RESULTS

Primary cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons were traced 
their neurite outgrowth under the phase contrast microscope. 
Neurons were also tested synaptogenic activities along the time 
courses of early periods in vitro by using one of the well known 

neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis markers and the detailed 
results are as follows.

Morphological changes of primary cultured neurons along 
the time courses
We investigated morphological changes of primary cultured 
neurons day by day from day 1 in vitro. Hippocampal neurons 
showed rather fast growing pattern so we could find definite 
neurite sprouting and outgrowth even from day 1 in vitro. 
Neurite outgrowth was faster in the areas of relatively high neural 
populations whereas some isolated neurons in the areas with 
very low neural populations showed apoptotic features (data 
not shown). Cultured hippocampal neurons of neighborhood 
gradually moved to each other showing patterns of aggregating 
groups and at this stage, neurites of various lengths radiated 
toward all directions to establish huge meshwork of neurites that 
were forming numerous synapses to each other (Fig. 1B). 
Neurite sprouting and outgrowth of cortical neurons were slower 
than hippocampal neurons. In many cases, we could find only 
limited degree of neurite sprouting from cortical neurons in early 
days in vitro (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we could fi nd more frequent 
apoptotic features in case of cortical neurons than hippocampal

neurons (data not shown). Although the neurite sprouting and 
outgrowth of primary cultured cortical neurons were slow than 
those of hippocampal neurons, cortical neurons showed almost 
same morphological features with hippocampal neurons toward 
the end of second week in vitro (Fig. 1D). Neurite outgrowth of 
primary cultured cells stopped from the day 14 or 18 in vitro and 
decayed slowly thereafter in both of cortical and hippocampal 
neurons.

Immunofl uorescence fi ndings
GAP-43 immunoreactivities were gradually increased according 
to these morphological changes from day 2 to day 8 in vitro. In 
day 2 in vitro, GAP-43 expressions still remained relatively low 

and hard to find granular immunofluorescence patterns along 
the outgrowing neurites. GAP-43 immunoreactivities increased 
rapidly thereafter as neurites extend and make connections 
with neighboring neurons. Typical granular patterns of GAP-
43 immunofluorescence along the outgrowing neurites (Fig. 
2D, E) could be found from day 4 in vitro and the intensity of 
immunofluorescence already reached maximum during the 
early stages of culture (day 8 in vitro). Unlike Gap-43, granular 
immunoreactive patterns of synaptophysin along the outgrowing 
neurites (Fig. 3A, C, D) were clearly found from day 2 in vitro with 
relatively high immunoreactive levels (Fig. 3A). These granular 
findings of GAP-43 and synaptophysin immunoreactivities 
also resembled synaptic button like structures when considered 
only in morphology. Patterns of GAP-43 and synaptophysin 
immunoreactivities were similar in both types of cortical and 
hippocampal neurons. Morphological synaptic connections 
among the neighboring neurites could be confi rmed more clearly

especially under high magnifi cations.

DISCUSSION

Western blotting fi ndings
Along with the immunofl uorescence, quantifi cation of synaptic 
marker expressions was examined by western blotting through 
the wide range of in vitro periods. GAP-43 and synaptophysin 
were detected from day 4 in vitro but the expression levels 
between hippocampal and cortical neurons were different with 
the time courses. In cortical neurons, GAP-43 and synaptophysin 
expressions reached highest levels within 1 week (day 5) in 
vitro. However in hippocampal neurons, both GAP-43 and 
synaptophysin expressions reached highest levels after 1 week 
(day 10) in vitro. In cortical neurons, the amounts of GAP-43 and 
synaptophysin expressions were considerably higher when they 
reached to highest levels than those in hippocampal neurons. Th  e 
diff erences between cortical and hippocampal neurons were more 
prominent in case of synaptophysin (Fig. 4B).

We characterized neurite outgrowth and synaptogenic activities 
in primary cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons using 
immunofl uorescence and Western blotting. Th  e main features of 
survival, proliferation, and neurite outgrowth were similar to those 
cultured in a mixture of MEM and B27-supplemented neurobasal 
medium from rat embryos [33]. Interestingly, the expression of 
synaptic markers from cortical neurons reached a peak level earlier 
(around 5 days in vitro) than that from hippocampal neurons (10 
days in vitro), although neurite outgrowth from hippocampal 
neurons was faster than that of cortical neurons. Furthermore, 
the peak amounts of expressed synaptic markers were also higher 
in cortical neurons than those in hippocampal neurons. Mice 
embryos at embryonic days 16~18 were used, although postnatal 
new-born rodents could be also used for primary neuronal or 
neural stem cell cultures [34-36]. The matrigel that we used for 
coating the glass cover slips creates more optimal conditions for 
survival and neurite outgrowth than coating with laminin or other 
substrates alone. The majority of plated neurons did not survive

on non-coated cover slips and clumped heavily (data not shown). 
We found a gradual increase in GAP-43 immunoreactivity 
that was associated with extension and branching of neurites. 
Synaptophysin immunoreactivity was already strong enough 
from day 2 in vitro. Although we are unable to confi rm whether 
they are true synaptic buttons, these fi ndings could be considered 
important because the more synaptic buttons secured, the 
better the synaptic functional or morphological study. GAP-
43 is a marker of synaptic plasticity that is critical for normal 
development of serotonergic innervation [37], and synaptophysin 
is a well-known synaptic vesicular protein. Considering prompt 
neurite outgrowth and abundant branching, synaptic marker 
expression levels should be clarifi ed, particularly during the early 
period in vitro. Our Western blotting results seemed to be a 
useful reference for experimental designs on synaptic activity and 
plasticity. 
We confirmed delayed neurite sprouting and outgrowth 
of primary cultured cortical neurons compared to those of 
hippocampal neurons. However, the expression levels of neurite 
outgrowth and synaptogenesis markers showed reversed patterns 
between cortical and hippocampal neurons. Th  ese results suggest 
that primary cultured cortical neurons could be utilized rather 
earlier (within 1 week in vitro) in functional studies associated 
with synaptogenesis. Although we are unable to suggest a possible 
explanation for this differential expression, the expression of 
synaptic vesicular associated proteins from cortical neurons 
seemed to be accelerated within the first week in vitro as a 
preparatory stage for explosive synaptogenic processes thereaft er. 
To explain these discrepancies between neuronal groups during 
the early in vitro period, we are going to introduce primary 
cultured neurons that lack synaptic markers or synaptic vesicular 
associated proteins (synaptobrevin and Munc-18) as a next step. 
Although we are only showing fi ndings based on morphological 
changes and synaptic markers expression at this time, we are 
planning to identify more detailed clues or mechanisms of growth 
cone formation and synaptogenesis during neuronal growth and 
diff erentiation by adding neurotrophic factors such brain derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Findings from peripheral nerve 
cell and neuronal stem cell cultures should also be compared to 
determine whether they have diff erent mechanisms according to 
their origin.
