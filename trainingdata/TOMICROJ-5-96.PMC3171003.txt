Abstract:  The  continuous  escalation  of  resistant  bacteria  against  a  wide  range  of  antibiotics  necessitates  discovering 
novel unconventional sources of antibiotics. B. oleracea L (red cabbage) is health-promoting food with proven anticancer 
and anti-inflammatory activities. However, it has not been researched adequately for its antimicrobial activity on potential 
resistant pathogens. The methanol crude extract of B. oleracea L. was investigated for a possible anti-microbial activity. 
The screening method was conducted using disc diffusion assay against 22 pathogenic bacteria and fungi. It was followed 
by  evaluation  of  the  minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC).  Moreover,  the  antibacterial  and  the  antifungal  activities 
were confirmed using the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), 
respectively. Remarkable, antibacterial activity was evident particularly against highly infectious microorganisms such as 
Methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus,  Escherichia  coli  O157:H7,  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa,  Klebsiella  pneumoniae, 
Staphylococcus  aureus,  and  Salmonella  enterica  serovar  Typhimurium  as  well  as  against  human  fungal  pathogens, 
Trichophyton rubrum and Aspergillus terreus. Red cabbage is a rich source of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins being 
the most abundant class, which  might  explain  its potent  antimicrobial action. This  extract is potentially novel for  future 
antimicrobials, inexpensive,  and readily available  at  a large  scale for pharmaceutical  companies for further investigation 
and processing. 

Keywords: Antibacterial, antifungal, red cabbage, anthocyanins. 

INTRODUCTION 

aureus 

Staphylococcus 

  As  a  result  of  the  indiscriminate  use  of  antimicrobial 
drugs in the treatment of infectious diseases, microorganisms 
have developed resistance  to many antibiotics [1].  Recently, 
methicillin-resistant 
(MRSA),  
Escherichia  coli  O157:H7,  Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis,  
and  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  are  considered  some  of  the 
most  virulent  microorganisms  for  the  human  population  [2]. 
Therefore,  there  is  a  critical  need  to  move  fast  and  develop 
alternative  antimicrobial  drugs.  One  approach  is  to  screen 
local medicinal plants which represent a rich source of novel 
antimicrobial  agents.  Medicinal  plants  are  an  integral  
component  of  research  development  in  microbiology  and

pharmaceutical  industry.  Natural  products  from  plants  have 
traditionally  provided  the  pharmaceutical  industry  with  one 
of its most important sources of lead compounds; up to 40% 
of  modern  drugs  are  derived  from  natural  sources  using  
either natural substances or synthesized versions [3].  

 
Flavonoids have been shown to be associated with many 
of  biological  effects  such  as  antibacterial,  antiviral,  anti-
inflammatory, antiplatelet, antioxidant, free radical scaveng-
ing, and vasodilatory actions [4]. High activity of flavonoids 
and  antioxidant  was  found  in  intensely  colored  vegetables, 
such  as  red  cabbage,  red  onion,  etc.  [5]  rendering  them  as 
likely  sources  of  novel  antimicrobial  activities  that  in  the 
future might lead to a breakthrough discovery of new antibi-
otics  or  antifungal  drugs.  On  the  other  hand,  synthetic 
chemicals  have  long  been  used  as  active  agents  in  reducing 
the  incidence  of  diseases  in  plants,  animals  and  humans; 
however,  these  drugs  are  not  cheap  and  takes  a  lot  of  effort 
to  produce  [1].  Therefore,  there  is  a  need  to  search  more  on

new  resources  such  as  medicinal  plants.  Medicinal  plants 
have  become  very  necessary  to  provide  the  society  with 
cheap  and  even  effective  medical  alternative  drugs.  Such 
medicinal plant products are believed  to be highly  crucial  to 
improve  the  society  health  level  and  prevent  the  develop-
ment of serious diseases [6].  

  Red cabbage (Brassica  oleracea L. var. capitata f. rubra 
DC), which belongs to the family Brassicaceae  is one of the 
most  important  vegetables  grown  worldwide  [7].  Recently, 
red  cabbage  has  attracted  much  attention  because  of  its 
physiological  functions  and  applications.  There  were  some 
studies conducted on red cabbage extract proving its antican-
cer  [8,  9],  anti-inflammatory  [10],  anti-diabetic  effects  [11]. 
However,  only  two  studies  for  its  antibacterial  effects  were 
done worldwide [12, 13]. 

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  there  was  no  previous  study 
covered  the  antimicrobial  effect  of  the  red  cabbage  extract 
against  E.  coli  O157:H7,  MRSA,  Staphylococcus  aureus, 
Salmonella  enterica  serovar  Typhimurium,  Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, and Klebsiella  pneumoniae. This study was also 
carried out to explore, for the first time, the antifungal effect 
of  red  cabbage  methanol  crude  extract  against  10  different 
fungal  species.  This  study  is  believed  to  be  the  cornerstone 
for  further  development  with  regards  to  red  cabbage  extract 
to  specify  exactly  the  antibacterial  and  antifungal  com-
pounds and their mechanism of action.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Plant Material and Preparation of the Extract 

 
Fresh  red  cabbage  was  purchased  from  local  markets  in 
the  state  of  Selangor,  Malaysia.  The  cabbage  leaves  were 
chopped  into  small  pieces  and  left  to  dry  at  room  tempera-
ture  in  dark  area  for  approximately  7  days.  After  drying  the 
leaves  were  ground  to  powder.  The  ground  powder  was  
extracted  1:10,  wt/v  with  2.4  mol/L  HCl  acidified  methanol 
(Merck,  Darmstadt,  Germany) 
to  extract  all  phenolic  
compounds,  free  and  conjugated  [14]  and  soaked  for  three 
days  in  dark  at  room  temperature.  The  solvent  was  then  
removed by filtration and fresh solvent was then added to the 
plant  material.  The  extraction  procedure  was  repeated  twice 
and extracts were combined and evaporated to dryness under 
vacuum  at  40oC.  The  pH  of  red  cabbage  leaves  extract 
ranged  from  6.8  to  7.2  which  is  a  neutral  pH.  The  powder 
was stored at -18oC.  

Microorganisms and Media 

  A total of 22 microorganisms consisting of 12 bacteria and 
10  fungi  were  used  in  this  study  (Table  1  and  3).  All  of  the 
microorganisms were obtained from the microbiology labora-
tory of the Institute of Bioscience, University Putra Malaysia. 
Bacteria, other than ATCC strains, were identified by the use 
of  biochemical  profiles  according  to  the  recommendations  of 
the  manual  of  clinical  microbiology  [15]  while  fungi,  other 
than  ATCC  strains,  were  identified  depending  on  the  macro- 
and micro- scopic features [16]. The tested bacteria and fungi 
were  maintained  on  nutrient  agar  (Merck,  Darmstadt,  Ger-
many) and sabouraud dextrose agar slants (Merck, Darmstadt, 
Germany), respectively, at 4°C until further use.  

  The tested bacteria were subjected to a panel of antibiotic 
susceptibility discs (BBL, USA) for profiling their antibiotic 

sensitivity.  Out  of  12  tested  bacteria,  three  multiple  drug 
resistant  (MDR)  bacteria  were  found.  The  MDR  bacteria 
were  MRSA,  P.  aeruginosa,  and  Enterohemorrhagic 
(EHEC)  E.  coli  O157:H7  which  were  highly  resistant  to 
more  than  four  antibiotics.  Isolates  other  than  MDR  and 
ATCC  strains  were  either  resistant  to  one  antibiotic  or  not 
resistant  to  any  of  the  tested  antibiotics.  MRSA  isolate  was 
completely  resistant  to  oxacillin,  erythromycin,  streptomy-
cin, clindamycin and tetracycline. Moreover, the MRSA iso-
late  was  a  bit  borderline  resistant  to  vancomycin,  namely 
vancomycin-intermediate  Staphylococcus  aureus  (VISA). 
The MDR P. aeruginosa isolate was resistant to ceftazidime, 
ciprofloxacin, 
and  piperacillin/ 
tazobactam. The MDR E.  coli O157:H7 isolate was resistant 
to  ampicillin,  kanamycin,  sulfisoxazole,  and  tetracycline. 
Therefore,  nine  non-MDR  and  three  MDR  bacteria  were 
used  to  test  the  antibacterial  effect  of  red  cabbage  leaves 
extract.

ANTIMICROBIAL SENSITIVITY TESTS 

Disc Diffusion Assay 

  The  dried  plant  extracts  were  dissolved  in  the  same  sol-
vent, methanol, to final concentrations of 200 and 500 mg/ml 
for  antibacterial  tests  and  200,  500  and  700  mg/ml  for  anti-
fungal tests and were sterilized by filtration through 0.45 (cid:1)m 
Millipore  filters  (Nalgene,  UK).  The  primary  screening  an-
timicrobial  test  was  carried  out  by  disc  diffusion  [15]  using 
100 (cid:1)l of suspension containing 108 CFU/ml of bacteria and 
105  spore/ml  of  fungi,  spread  evenly  on  the  surface  of  the 
nutrient  agar  and  sabouraud  dextrose  agar  plates,  respec-
tively.  Sterile  Whatman  No.  1  filter  paper  (MACHEREY-
NAGEL,  MN  615,  Germany)  was  used  to  prepare  6  mm  in 
diameter discs.  These discs  were processed, in  triplicates,  to 
contain 10 (cid:1)l of  the  extract, i.e.; (2mg/disc), (5mg/disc) and 
(7mg/disc)  for  extract  concentrations  (200  mg/ml),  (500 
mg/ml) and (700 mg/ml), respectively; these discs were then 
impregnated  in  the  inoculated  agar.  Negative  controls  were 
prepared, in triplicates per Petri dish, using the same solvents 
employed  to  dissolve  the  plant  extracts.  Ten  (cid:1)g/disc  of 
Streptomycin (CALBIOCHEM,  China) and Amphotericin  B 
(Sigma,  Steinheim,  Germany)  were  used,  in  triplicates  per 
Petri  dish,  as  positive  controls  or  reference  standard  drugs 
for  comparing  the  sensitivity  of  tested  bacteria  and  fungi, 
respectively,  with  the  test  extract.  For  bacteria,  the  inocu-
lated  plates  were  incubated  for  24  h  at  37°C  and,  for  fungi, 
the inoculated plates were incubated for 3-5 days at 30-35°C. 
Clear inhibition zones around discs indicated the presence of 
antimicrobial  activity.  For  optimal  fidelity  of  results,  each 
assay was repeated three times.  

Microdilution Assay 

  The  minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  values 
were  also  studied  for  the  microorganisms  found  sensitive  to 
the extract by using disc diffusion assay. The MIC is defined 
as  the  lowest  concentration  of  the  compounds  to  inhibit  the 
growth  of  microorganisms.  The  microdilution  method  was 
used  according  to  the  methodology  referred  by  [17]  with 
some  modifications.  The  inocula  of  bacteria  were  prepared 
from  12  h  broth  cultures  and  standardized  to  108  CFU/ml. 
And  fungal  inocula  were  prepared  from  3-5  days  fresh  fun-
gal cultures, depending on the fungus type, and standardized

to  105 spore/ml.  Stock  extracts  of  1200  and  700  mg/ml  con-
centrations were prepared in 10% dimethylsulfoxide (Merck, 
Darmstadt,  Germany)  for  bacterial  and  fungal  tests,  respec-
tively.  Serial  dilutions  of  the  stock  extract  solutions  were 
prepared  in  concentrations  range  from  0  to  600  mg/ml  for 
bacteria  and  0  to  350  mg/ml  for  fungi.  For  bacteria,  the  
extract  solution  was  diluted  using  nutrient  broth  (Merck, 
Darmstadt, Germany) and, for fungi, the extract solution was 
diluted  in  sabouraud  dextrose  broth  (Merck,  Darmstadt, 
Germany).  One  hundred  microlitter  of  the  stock  extract  was 
transferred to each of the first three wells of the first column 
to  prepare  the  first  extract  dilution  then  100  (cid:1)l/well  of  
each  microorganism  suspension  were dispensed  into  96-well 
flat-bottom  microtiter  plate  (Steriline,  UK).  From  the  first 
column,  100  μl  from  each  well  was  transferred  to  the  wells 
of  the  next  column  to  prepare  the  second  extract  dilution  
with  100  (cid:1)l/well  of  the  microorganism.  The  rest  of  the  
extract  dilutions  were  prepared  by  the  same  method.  On  
the other hand, triplicates of extract-free bacterial and fungal 
spore  suspensions  were  used  as  negative  controls  as  well  
as  triplicates  of  streptomycin  at  concentration  range  of  
(0.02-1  (cid:1)g/ml)  and  amphotericin  B  at  concentration  range  
of  (0.5-3  (cid:1)g/ml)  were  used  as  standard  antibacterial  and  
antifungal  positive  controls.  The  final  volume  in  each  
well  was  200  (cid:1)l.  The  plate  was  covered  with  a  sterile  plate 
sealer  80/140mm  (Greiner  bio-one,  Germany).  For  bacteria, 
plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C while for fungi; plates 
were  incubated  for  3-5  days  at  30-35°C.  The  growth  of  
bacteria  and  fungi  was  determined  by  absorbance  values  
at  600  nm  and  530  nm  respectively  using  fully  automated 
Microplate  Spectrophotometer  (Bio-Rad  Laboratories,  Her-
cules, Canada). 

  To  confirm  MIC  and  to  establish  minimum  bactericidal 
(MBC)  and  minimum  fungicidal  (MFC)  concentrations,  10 
(cid:1)l  of  each  culture  medium  for  bacteria  and  fungi  with  no 
visible growth were removed from each well and inoculated, 
in  triplicates,  on  nutrient  agar  and  sabouraud  dextrose  agar 
plates,  respectively.  After  incubation  for  24  h  at  37°C,  for 
bacteria,  and  3-5  days  at  30-35°C,  for  fungi,  the  number  of 
surviving  organisms  was  determined.  MBC  and  MFC  are 
defined  as  the  lowest  extract  concentration  at  which  99.9% 
of  the  microorganism  is  killed.  The  extract  tested  in  this 
study was screened three times for each organism. 

Scanning  Electron  Microscope  (SEM)  and  Transmission 
Electron Microscope (TEM) Observations 

Scanning  electron  microscope  observations  were  carried 
 
out  on  S.  aureus  (ATCC  29247)  and  E.coli  (ATCC  25922) 
as  an  example  for  the  extract  effect  on  bacterial  cells  of 
Gram  negative  and  Gram  positive  bacteria.  One  milliliter  of 
108 CFU/ml of S.aureus or E.coli bacterial suspensions were 
incubated  with  the  extract  at  concentraion  of  100  mg/ml  for 
24  h  at  37°C.  A  10%  DMSO-treated  culture  was  used  as  a 
negative control. The control and the extract treated cells were 
fixed  in  4%  glutaraldehyde  (Sigma,  Steinheim,  Germany)  and 
later  postfixed  in  1%  osmium  tetraoxide  (Sigma,  Steinheim, 
Germany)  and  they  were  later  washed  by  0.1M  sodium  
cacodylate  buffer,  pH  7.4  (Sigma,  Steinheim,  Germany). 
After  eliminating  the  remaining  osmium  tetraoxide,  the  
samples  were  dehydrated  in  a  graduated  acetone  (Merck, 

Hafidh et al. 

Darmstadt,  Germany)  series  (35  to  100%).  Each  step  was 
performed for about 10 to 15 min at room temperature. 

  The specimens were then dried in  the critical dryer (Bal-
tec,  CPD  030).  The  dried  specimens  were  mounted  onto 
stubs  by  double-sided  carbon  tape.  The  specimens  were 
coated with a thin layer of gold by a Polaron SC 502 sputter 
coater,  and  were  examined  in  the  Scanning  Electron  Micro-
scope (Philips, XL30 ESEM).  

 
For  the  transmission  electron  microscope  observation, 
after  the  dehydration  step,  the  fixed  cells  were  embedded 
with Epon and the small blocks of bacteria were  cut with an 
ultramicrotome  (Reichert  Jung  Ultracut-S,  Leica).  The  ultra 
thin  sections  were  then  analyzed  using  TEM  (Philips, 
EM400 HMG). 

Statistical Analysis  

  The  disc  diffusion  assay  was  conducted  in  triplicates  in 
three  independent  experiments.  Therefore,  the  inhibition 
zone  was  expressed  as  mean  SD.  SPSS  software  version 
12.0.0.2 was used.  

RESULTS  

Disc Diffusion Assay for Bacteria 

  Qualitative  and  quantitative  results  were  obtained  by  the 
inhibition  zone  and  zone  diameter,  respectively  (Table  1). 
The  methanol  extract  of  B.  oleracea  showed  significant  in-
hibitory effect against the growth of both Gram negative and 
Gram  positive  bacteria.  The  mean  inhibition  zone  for  the 
Gram  positive  bacteria  ranged  from  7  to  17  mm  indicating  
a  remarkable  antibacterial  effect  when  compared  with  that  
of  streptomycin,  the  positive  control,  which  ranged  from  0  
to  18  mm.  Interestingly,  the  methanol  crude  extract  for  B. 
oleracea exerted an exclusive  antibacterial  effect against the 
problematic  bacteria  MRSA  while,  interestingly,  the  anti- 
bacterial  effect  of  the  positive  control,  streptomycin,  was 
zero. In contrast to all previous studies known in the field of 
antibacterial  natural  products,  the  methanol  crude  extract  of 
B.  oleracea  in  the  current  study  revealed  highly  significant 
antibacterial  effect  against  the  entire  tested  Gram  negative 
bacteria (12-20 mm zone of inhibition) whereas the standard 
drug, streptomycin, exhibited zone of inhibition ranged from 
11-19 mm only. 

Microdilution Assay for Bacteria 

  The  MIC  of  the  Gram  positive  bacteria  was  100  mg/ml, 
including  MRSA,  while  the  confirmatory  test,  MBC,  was 
400  mg/ml  except  for B.  subtilis  was  200  mg/ml  (Table  2). 
On  the  other  hand,  the  MIC  of  the  Gram  negative  bacteria 
was  between  100-400  mg/ml  while  the  confirmatory  test, 
MBC,  was between 200-500 mg/ml (Table 2).  The  logarith-
mic OD values were demonstrated for each tested bacterium. 
OD  values  decreased  in  a  dose  dependent  manner  reflecting 
the decrease took place in  the bacterial growth (Fig. 1  & 2). 
The  findings  of  the  MIC  and  MBC  were  in  agreement  with 
the findings obtained by the primary screening test, disc dif-
fusion  assay.  Hence,  disc  diffusion,  MIC,  and  MBC  assays 
together  provided  evidence  that  the  B.  oleracea  extract  was 
highly effective as antimicrobial agent against both the tested 
Gram negative and positive bacteria.

Antimicrobial Assays for Fungi  

In  contrast  to  the  effective  antibacterial  activity  revealed 
 
by the crude methanol  extract of red cabbage leaves,  the ex-
tract did not demonstrate effective antifungal activity against 
most of the tested fungi. Nevertheless, the extract showed an 
unprecedented  potent  antifungal  activity  against  two  of  im-
portant human fungal pathogens namely, T.  rubrum [18] and 
A.  terreus [19] at concentrations (700 mg/ml) and (500, 700 

mg/ml)  respectively  (Table  3).  The  extract  under  these  two 
concentrations  showed  clear  zone  of  inhibition.  To  confirm 
the antifungal activity, both MIC and MFC were done which 
confirmed  the  antifungal  activity  against  these  two  fungi. 
The  MIC  of  the  extract  against  T.  rubrum  and  A.  terreus  
was  75  mg/ml  while  the  MBC  of  the  extract  was  300  and 
150  mg/ml,  respectively  (Table  4).  The  growth  inhibition 
was  dose  dependent  and  was  reflected  by  the  decrease  of

Mode of Antimicrobial Action  

  The  nature  of  the  antibacterial  effect  of  the  extract  with 
regard  to  inhibition/killing  of  tested  bacteria  is  important. 
The  MBC: MIC ratio for bacteria or MFC: MIC for fungi is 
used to specify the nature of the antimicrobial effect against 
any  given  pathogen  [20].  When  the  MBC:  MIC  or  MFC: 
MIC ratio of a pathogen is between 1:1 to 2:1, the  chemical 
substance  is  considered  as  bactericidal  or  fungicidal  against 
that pathogen [20]. On the other hand, if the ratio was > 2:1, 
the mode of antimicrobial action is more likely to be bacteri-
static  or  fungistatic.  Therefore,  MBC:  MIC  or  MFC:  MIC 
ratio  was  calculated  for  each  bacterial  or  fungal  pathogen, 
respectively.  It  was  found  that  the  tested  extract  of  red  cab-
bage  exerted  a  clear  bactericidal  effect  against  6  isolates  of 
bacteria while it exerted bacteristatic effect against 5 isolates 
only (Table 2). For fungi, the extract exerted fungicidal effect 
against A. terreus and fungistatic against T. rubrum (Table 4). 

SEM and TEM Electron Microscope Observations 

  The  antibacterial  effect  of  red  cabbage  extract  on  S. 
aureus  and E.  coli was seen clearly by SEM. After exposing 
S.  aureus  and E.  coli to 100 mg/ml of the methanol extract, 
the cells were collapsed and became sticky, almost seen like 
a  shrunken  cells  when  compared  to  control  cells  (Fig. 4).  In 
addition, detachment of the cell membrane of the tested bac-
terial  cells  was  seen  in  response  to  the  added  red  cabbage 
extract.  Therefore,  the  antibacterial  effect  of  red  cabbage 
extract,  observed  by  TEM,  was  demonstrated  as  clear  
morphorlogical changes in the treated cells (Fig. 5). 

DISCUSSION  

  The  wide  spread  of  MDR  microbes  raises  the  need  for 
new, cheap, effective, and safe drugs. One of the best candi-

dates to address this need appears to be the natural resources. 
Before  being  considered  as  a  food,  cabbage  was  valued  
and  used  for  medicinal  purposes  in  treating  headache,  gout, 
diarrhea  and  peptic  ulcers  [21].  Among  the  substances  that 
seem  to  be  responsible  for  these  properties  are  polyphenols 
[22].  Red  cabbage  is  a  rich  source  of  phenolic  compounds, 
mainly anthocyanins which are the most abundant class [23].  

Previous studies reported that methanol was the best sol-
 
vent for the consistent extraction of antimicrobial substances 
from  medicinal  plants  compared  to  other  solvents  such  as 
water, ethanol, or hexane [24]. For this reason, methanol was 
used in this study to extract the active antimicrobial compo-
nents  from  red  cabbage  leaves.  The  findings  of  the  current 
study demonstrated some novel and significant antimicrobial 
activities  against  the  tested  bacteria  and  fungi.  Remarkable 
zones of inhibition were observed around the discs of the red 
cabbage extract in nutrient agar plates inoculated with Gram 
negative (12-20 mm in diameter) and Gram positive bacteria 
(7-17  mm  in  diameter).  This  finding  seems  to  be  unique  for 
the  current  study  when  compared  with  previous  studies 
which  were  conducted  to  test  the  antibacterial  activity  of 
different  natural  products.  These  reports  revealed  that  their 
extracts  were  effective  against  Gram  positive  rather  than 
Gram  negative  bacteria  and  they  attributed  this  variation  to 
the  dissimilarity  between  Gram  negative  and  Gram  positive 
cell  walls  which  makes  Gram  negative  more  resistant  to 
many  antibacterial  agents  [25].  This  provides  evidence  that 
red  cabbage  extract  possesses  different  antibacterial  compo-
nents  exerting  different  mechanisms  of  action.  The  wide 
spectrum of antibacterial effects of the red cabbage extract in 
the  current  study  might  be  attributed  to  the  acid  methanol 
procedure  of  extraction  which  is  suitable  for  extracting  all 
fractions efficiently.  

 
In  fact,  only  two  studies  were  found  to  be  conducted  on 
the  antibacterial  effect  of  red  cabbage  extract  worldwide.  A

ATCC 25922, D: Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, E: Escherichia coli O157:H7, F: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, G: Klebsiella pneumoniae and H: 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 25241) which demonstrated by log10 measured by microdilution assay. The decrease in bacte-
rial growth resulted from red cabbage (RC) methanol crude extract treatment in different concentrations. These eight bacteria showed no visible 
growth around the 6 mm disc impregnated in RC methanol crude extract at 200 mg/ml concentration in the disc diffusion test. 

study done by Lee and his colleagues in 2003 found that red 
cabbage  juice  has  mild  activity  against  Staphylococcus  epi-
dermidis  but  not  against  Klebsiella  pneumoniae  [12],  while 
Park and his colleagues in 2004 found that the methanol red 
cabbage  fractions  seem  to  be  active  against  B.  subitilis,  E. 
coli and, with mild action, against P.  aeruginosa [13]. In the 
current study the effect of red cabbage extract was studied on 
many  bacterial  species,  including  bacteria  not  researched 
before  such  as;  S.  aureus,  MRSA,  E.  coli  O157:H7,  and 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Besides, P.  aeru-
ginosa  and  K.  pneumoniae  were  researched  before  but,  un-
like  the  results  of  the  current  study,  a  study  revealed  a  very 
mild response and the second one revealed no response at all 
to red cabbage extract [12, 13]. 

 
In  the  current  study,  the  considerable  inhibition  zone 
gained  from  the  red  cabbage  extract  at  concentration  500 
mg/ml against MRSA, 7 mm versus 0 mm of standard drug, 
and  S.  aureus,  about  11  mm  versus  17-18  mm  of  standard 

drug,  was  highly  promising.  The  MIC  for  MRSA  and  S. 
aureus  bacteria  was  100  mg/ml  while  the  MBC  was  400 
mg/ml.  Therefore,  the  MBC:  MIC  ratio  was  4:  1  indicating 
that  the  potent  anti-MRSA  and  anti-S.  aureus  effect  was 
more likely bacteristatic in nature. A recent study found that 
hospitals  across  the  United  States  and  around  the  world  are 
fighting  the  escalation  of  drug-resistant  infections  [26].  Fur-
thermore,  an  increase  in  community-associated  methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections have 
been  reported  in  many  literatures  [27].  Most  of  these  infec-
tions are severe and life-threatening. Taken into account that 
the tested MRSA was found of intermediate response to van-
comycin  (VISA),  the  antibacterial  agent(s)  in  red  cabbage 
extract  responsible  for  this  action  must  be  a  top  priority  for 
the study and discovery. It is worth mentioning that MRSA –
VISA  strains  present  a  thickening  of  the  cell  wall  which  is 
believed to deplete the vancomycin available to kill the bac-
teria which worries many physicians and microbiologists on

the near future prospects of the current anti-MRSA therapies 
[28]. Furthermore, the current red cabbage anti-MRSA activ-
ity  and  its  underlying  mechanism  of  action  seem  novel  and 
different  from  other  known  antibiotics.  Accordingly,  the 

discovery  of  natural,  effective,  and  cheap  drug  against  this 
resistant  bacterium  might  be  considered  as  a  breakthrough 
solution for this problem all around the world.

  Recently, E.  coli O157:H7 was shown to be highly resis-
tant  to  different  antibiotics  which  are  commonly  used  by 
clinicians  and  veterinarians  for  the  treatment  of  infections 
with  Gram-negative  bacteria  [29].  For  this  reason,  the  used 
isolate  of  EHEC  O157:H7  in  the  current  study  was  selected 
to  be  highly  resistant  isolate  against  four  antibiotics.  The 
antibacterial  activity  results  of  the  of  red  cabbage  extract 
against E.coli O157:H7 was remarkable. The inhibition zone 
was  about 17 mm  at  concentration 500  mg/ml of  the  extract 
which  is  only  1  mm  less  than  the  diameter  of  the  standard 
antibiotic, streptomycin. Moreover, the MBC: MIC ratio was 
2:1,  revealing  potent  bactericidal  effect  of  red  cabbage 
against this notorious bug. Therefore, the extract of red cab-

bage can be considered as a novel source of a new candidate 
antibacterial  agent  for  both  human  and  animal  E.  coli 
O157:H7 diseases. 

 
For  P.  aeruginosa,  it  is  known  to  be  resistant  to  high 
concentrations of salts and dyes, weak antiseptics, and many 
commonly  used  antibiotics  [30].  The  isolate  of  P.  aerugi-
nosa  used  in  the  current  study  was  selected  to  be  highly  re-
sistant  against  6  different  antibiotics.  Despite  its  bad  history 
in antibiotic sensitivity, interestingly, the red cabbage extract 
of  the  current  study  showed  19  mm  inhibition  zone  which 
was 1 mm larger than that of streptomycin itself. Moreover, 
MBC  (200):  MIC  (100)  mg/ml,  2:1  ratio,  indicated  that  the

at  lower  concentration  of  extract  than  in  most  other  tested 
bacteria. 

against 

ampicillin, 

aminoglycosides, 

 
For  K.  pneumoniae,  it  was  found  that  it  has  developed 
several  strains  resistant  to  several  antibiotics.  These  strains 
are  known  as  extended-spectrum  ß-lactamase  (ESBL)–
producing  K.  pneumoniae  [31].  Similarly,  Salmonella  en-
terica  serovar  Typhimurium  began  to  show  serious  antimi-
crobial  resistance  patterns  worldwide  via  ESBL  leading  to 
resistance 
and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  [32].  Interestingly,  a  re-
markable  antibacterial  effect,  bacteristatic  and  bactericidal, 
was found by the red cabbage extract against K.  pneumoniae 
and  S.  enterica  serovar  Typhimurium.  The  antibacterial  ef-
fect  of  the  extract  against  S.  enterica  serovar  Typhimurium 
was  unique  in  that  MBC:  MIC  ratio  was  the  lowest  one 
among  all  tested  bacteria,  1.25:1.  Besides,  the  inhibition 
zone  was  the  same  for  both  200  and  500  mg/ml  concentra-
tions  of  the  extract  and  larger  than  that  of  streptomycin.  In 
fact,  the  15  mm  inhibition  zone  indicates  a  very  powerful 
bactericidal  effect  of  red  cabbage  extract  against  this  bacte-
rium.  

  Collectively,  three  MDR  bacteria  used  in  the  current 
study were resistant to 15 powerful antibiotics that belong to 
8 different groups of antibiotics. These 8 groups belong to 5 
common  modes  of  action  including  cell  wall  targeting  peni-
cillin  and  3rd  and  4th  generations  of  cephalosporin’s,  30S 
ribosomal  subunit  targeting  glycopeptides  and  polyketide, 
50S ribosomal subunit targeting lincosamide and macrolides, 
DNA  synthesis-inhibiting  fluoroquinolones,  and  enzymes 
competitors  sulfonamides.  Since,  red  cabbage  leaves  extract 
exerted a powerful bactericidal effect against two MDR bac-
teria  and  exerted  a  bacteriostatic  effect  against  one  MDR 
bacteria,  the  antimicrobial  effect  of  the  red  cabbage  leaves 
extract  seems  to bypass the most common pathways of anti-
biotics resistance. Therefore, this provided a clue on the high 
possibility  for  the  presence  of  novel  antimicrobial  com-
pound(s)  in  red  cabbage  extract  that  might  not  share  the 
same mode of action with the above mentioned antibiotics or 
at  least  have  some  modified  interactions  of  the  same  path-
way. 

  A.  terreus  infections  have  become  a  growing  concern  in 
the  past  few  years  as  a  causative  agent  of  invasive  aspergil-
losis  [33].  This  infection  has  become  resistant  to  most  com-
mon antifungal agents used  to treat  aspergillosis [34]. In ad-
dition, T.  rubrum is the most common dermatophyte species. 
It is a  major concern because feet and nail  infections caused 
by this organism are extremely difficult to cure [18]. In addi-
tion,  resistance  to  most  of  the  commercially  available  anti-
fungal  agents  was  recorded  [35].  The  use  of  red  cabbage 
extract in the current study demonstrated significant zones of 
inhibition  in  the  fungal  growth  of  T.  rubrum,  8  mm  versus 
11  mm  of  standard  drug,  and  A.  terreus,  11  mm  versus  10 
mm of standard drug. Hence, it was interesting that the inhi-
bition zone of A.  terreus by red cabbage extract at concentra-
tion  700  mg/ml  was  larger  than  that  produced  by  the  stan-
dard  drug.  Moreover,  the  MFC:  MIC  ratio  revealed  that  red 
cabbage  extract  is  fungicidal  against  A.  terreus,  ratio  2:  1, 
and  fungistatic  against  T.  rubrum,  ratio  4:1.  No  previous 
study  recorded  such  antifungal  activity  of  red  cabbage  ex-

tract  against  any  fungi.  It  was  only  one  study  revealed  a 
negative result of the red  cabbage extract fraction against A. 
oryzae  [13],  and  it  is  in  confirmatory  with  the  result  of  this 
study.  Both  T.  rubrum  and  A.  terreus  are  important  human 
pathogens  and  cause  serious  health  problems  all  around  the 
world.  Therefore,  the  discovered  antifungal  effect  in  this 
study might be considered as a prelude to discover new anti-
fungal agents to those two problematic pathogenic fungi. 

  The  mixture  of  phenolic  compounds  acts  synergistically 
better than its individual components separately [36]. Studies 
showed  that  the  mixture  of  anthocyanins  (ATH)  extracted 
from  red  cabbage  possessed  high  antioxidant  properties  and 
these studies suggested  the presence of the protective action 
of  this  extract  [37].  This  synergistic  effect  of  the  phenolic 
compounds  in  red  cabbage  extract,  particularly  anthocynins 
mixture,  may explain the potent antibacterial action  and, for 
the  first  time,  the  significant  antifungal  action  manifested  in 
the current study. Studies revealed that the antioxidant activ-
ity of the ATH-rich extract from red  cabbage leaves is high, 
about  33  Trolox  equivalents  (TE)  per  g  of  fresh  matter  
and  328  TE  per  g  of  dry  matter,  whereas,  in  fruits  such  as 
blackberries, cranberries, and strawberries, TE values ranged 
from  35  to  162  per  g  of  dry  matter  [38,  39].  Taking  into  
account  such  high  antioxidant  capacity  of  the  ATH-rich  ex-
tract  from  red  cabbage  leaves,  we  suppose  that  the  potential 
antimicrobial  activity may be due  to  this  subclass of flavon-
oids.  Interestingly,  recent  research  showed  that,  through 
overlapping  or  complementary  effects,  the  complex  mixture 
of  phytochemicals  in  fruits  and  vegetables  provides  a  better 
protective  effect  on  health  than  single  phytochemicals  [40]. 
Therefore,  the  complex  components  of  red  cabbage  extract 
needs to be scrutinized in depth in order to find the best mix-
ture  of  effective  components  that  had  role  in  the  currently 
shown antibacterial  and antifungal actions. This will be nec-
essary  to translate the findings of  this  study into novel  com-
mercial antibiotics and antifungal drugs.  

 
Furthermore,  one  of  the  interesting  points  regarding  red 
cabbage leaves extract is its pH range of 6.8 to 7.2. This neu-
tral pH eliminates the possibility that the antimicrobial effect 
of  this  extract  is  attributed  to  its  ability  to  create  an  acidic 
environment. It was proposed that the possible mechanism of 
antimicrobial  activity  by  some  of  the  phenolic  containing 
extracts is by creating  an acidic  environment  that causes the 
bacterial  cell  membrane  disruption  [41].  Therefore,  the  sub-
stantial  results  obtained  in  the  current  study  may  be  due,  in 
part,  to  the  ATH  subclass  of  flavonoids.  Many  studies  pro-
posed  various  mechanisms  to  account  for  the  antioxidant 
ability  of  ATH.  They  include  radical  scavenging  ability, 
metal chelating property, hydrogen donating ability, complex 
formation  with  DNA  and  direct  binding  to  proteins  [42-44]. 
These various mechanisms alone or together may attribute to 
the potent antimicrobial activity we had obtained. 

  Many studies attempted to investigate the  effect of crude 
plants extracts on different bacteria to  support the antibacte-
rial  activity  they  gained  from  the  disc  diffusion  and  the  mi-
crodilution  assays.  In  this  study  the  electron  microscopic 
observations  for  both  SEM  and  TEM  demonstrated  clearly 
the antibacterial effect of the methanol extract of red cabbage 
on  bacterial  cells.  There  were  clear  morphological  changes 
with shrunken and collapsed cells of the teated bacteria. This 

Antimicrobial Activity of Red Cabbage Leaves Extract

could  be  due  to  the  leak  in  the  cell  wall  or  perhaps  some  
alteration  in  the  membrane  permeability.  These  findings  
augmented the antibacterial prospects for the crude methanol 
extract  of  the  red  cabbage  which  give  clue  that  crude  
methanol  extract  of  the  red  cabbagea  is  a  promising  anti- 
microbial agent. 

  Taken  together,  it  was  concluded  that  the  red  cabbage 
extract  using  acid  methanol  solvent  showed  a  potent  anti- 
microbial  effect  against  the  tested  Gram  negative,  Gram 
positive  bacteria,  and  fungi.  Most  interestingly,  for  the  first 
time,  red  cabbage  extract  showed  remarkable  antibacterial 
effect  against  MRSA,  S.  aureus,  E.  coli  O157:H7,  S.  
enterica  serovar  Typhimurium,  and  K.  pneumoniae  as  well 
as  remarkable  antifungal  effect  against  T.  rubrum  and  
A.  terreus.  Moreover,  the  bacterial  species  that  weakly  
responded to red cabbage extract in previous studies, namely 
P.  aeruginosa,  were  shown  to  be  strongly  eradicated  by  the 
bactericidal  effect  of  the  extract  of  the  current  study.  This 
potent  effect  may  be  due  to  the  high  level  of  red  cabbage 
active polyphenols, precisely, the  anthocyanins. The in  vitro 
results  of  this  study  on  the  efficacy  of  red  cabbage  crude 
extract  as  antimicrobial agent may give confidence about  its 
activity  if  used  in  vivo.  Considering  the  safety  of  a  natural 
product  extract,  red  cabbage  extract  could  be  a  promising 
antimicrobial agent if used in vivo. 

CONCLUSION 

  The findings of the current study unveiled  a novel, pow-
erful,  and  broad  spectrum  antimicrobial  activity  of  red  cab-
bage  leaves  extract  against  a  large  number  of  human  and 
animal  pathogenic  microbes  including  MDR  bacteria,  non- 
MDR  bacteria,  and  fungi.  Further  investigations  on  the  ac-
tive  antimicrobial  components  in  the  red  cabbage  methanol 
crude  extract  are  required  to  provide  the  pharmaceutical 
companies with cheap and effective antimicrobial agent.
