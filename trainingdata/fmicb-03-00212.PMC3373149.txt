Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is an endemic Latin American mycosis caused by Paracoc-
cidioides brasiliensis and also by the recently described P. lutzii. The systemic mycosis
is the 10th leading cause of death due to infectious diseases in Brazil. As published,
1,853 patients died of PCM in the 1996–2006 decade in this country. The main diagnostic
antigen of P. brasiliensis is the 43 kDa glycoprotein gp43, and its 15-mer peptide QTLI-
AIHTLAIRYAN, known as P10, contains the T-CD4+ epitope that elicits an IFN-γ-mediated
Th1 immune response, which effectively treats mice intratracheally infected with PCM.
The association of peptide P10 with antifungal drugs rendered an additive protective effect,
even in immunosuppressed animals, being the basis of a recommended treatment pro-
tocol. Other immunotherapeutic tools include a peptide carrying a B cell epitope as well
as protective anti-gp43 monoclonal antibodies. New delivery systems and gene therapy
have been studied in prophylactic and therapeutic protocols to improve the efﬁcacy of
the recognized antigens aiming at a future vaccine as co-adjuvant therapy in patients
with PCM.

INTRODUCTION
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) appears to be caused by a complex
group of fungi within the Paracoccidioides genus comprising four
distinct phylogenetic lineages known as PS2, PS3, S1, and Pb01-
like (Carvalho et al., 2005; Matute et al., 2006). Based on clinical
and genetic studies, the Pb01 isolate differs from the other strains
and has been included in a new species known as Paracoccidioides
lutzii (Teixeira et al., 2009).

The disease is endemic in a broad region from Mexico to
Argentina. About 80% of diagnosed patients are from Brazil.
Most patients are rural workers but cases in urban centers located
on the route of migration movements are also found (Restrepo,
1985; McEwen et al., 1995). The infection starts by inhalation of
conidia that subsequently transform into infective yeast forms in
the lung. Although acquisition of the fungus typically results in
asymptomatic infection, it can progress in susceptible individu-
als and give rise to acute, subacute, and chronic clinical forms
of the disease (Franco et al., 1993). Systemic dissemination of
the fungus can be fatal. A mortality evaluation of P. brasiliensis
showed that it is the 10th most common cause of death owing
to chronic/recurrent infections and parasitic diseases in Brazil.
When analyzed as the underlying cause, 51.2% of deaths were
due to PCM, which is then one of the most lethal among sys-
temic mycoses. In the 1996–2006 decade, the most severe cases
of PCM occurred in the 30–59 years-of-age range, predomi-
nantly (87%) in men (Prado et al., 2009). Besides the mortality
data,
it is important to consider the morbidity associated to
the disease, which invariably leads to withdrawal of the patients

from labor activities or school. In the severe cases, hospital-
ization of patients is necessary for long periods of time with
high costs.

Antifungal chemotherapy is required for PCM treatment,
although there is no assurance, even after treatment, of complete
destruction of the fungus. Initial treatment depends on the sever-
ity of the disease and may last from 2 to 6 months; it includes
sulfonamides, amphotericin B, or azoles. In severe cases endove-
nous amphotericin B or sulfonamides are required and when there
is clinical improvement, it can be switched to oral sulfonamides or
azoles. Extended periods of treatment are often necessary, up to
2 or more years, with a signiﬁcant frequency of relapsing disease.
According to Brazilian guidelines, oral itraconazole is the drug
of choice (Shikanai-Yasuda, 2005; Shikanai-Yasuda et al., 2006;
Travassos and Taborda, 2011).

Although chemotherapy stands as the basic treatment of PCM,
therapeutic vaccination with fungal antigens or passive transfer
of speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies may boost the cell immune
response and add to the protective effect of chemotherapy, eventu-
ally counteracting a relapsing disease and reducing ﬁbrotic sequels.
Both the innate immune response and the adaptive immunity are
important for the antifungal protective effect. The immune system
recognizes fungal antigens with subsequent eliciting of antibodies
and T cell protective responses. Cytokines and chemokines are pro-
duced. IFN-γ-activated macrophages have increased fungistatic
and fungicidal activities. Antigens of P. brasiliensis, gp43 or
P10, depend on IFN-γ for their protective activity (reviewed in
Travassos et al., 2008).

Vaccine against paracoccidioidomycosis

The aim of this review is to update the new concepts and
methodologies used in the attempt to develop a therapeutic
vaccine against PCM.

THE USE OF FUNGAL WHOLE CELLS AS VACCINE
The use of low-virulence yeast cells as the immunization tool
has been investigated. Subcutaneous infection with P. brasilien-
sis Pb265 induced cellular immunity with high T cell reactivity
in susceptible mice which resulted in immunoprotection or dis-
ease exacerbation depending on the route of a secondary infection
(Arruda et al., 2007a). Immunoprotection with aseptical cure was
shown in the pre-immunization procedure and required a combi-
nation of CD4
T cells and the production
of endogenous IFN-γ and IL-12 as well as increased levels of
anti-P. brasiliensis-speciﬁc IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies (Arruda
et al., 2007b).

T cells and CD8

Radio-attenuated yeast cells lost their virulence after the expo-
sure to 6.5 kGy. The irradiated cells were examined by scanning,
and also transmission electron microscopy. When examined 2 h
after irradiation the cells showed deep folds or collapsed. The
plasma membrane and cell wall were intact, but an extensive
DNA fragmentation was found (Demicheli et al., 2007). The use of
attenuated yeast cells by gamma-irradiation induced a long lasting
protection in BALB/c mice (Demicheli et al., 2006; do Nascimento
Martins et al., 2007). For this purpose, BALB/c mice were immu-
nized twice in the ocular plexus with 105 viable cells. Animals were
then challenged, by the same route, with yeast cells after 30, 45,
and 60 days after the last immunization. Thirty days after the chal-
lenge, a signiﬁcant reduction in the fungal burden was observed in
the lung, spleen, and liver. A 99.5% decrease in CFU was obtained
90 days post challenge. The animals showed high levels of IFN-γ
and IgG2a with very low production of IL-10 and IL-5, sugges-
tive of a Th1 immune cell response (do Nascimento Martins et al.,
2007). The number of immunizations with radio-attenuated yeast
cells also interferes with the immune response. Authors found
that mice immunized once developed a mixed Th1/Th2 response,
which was less efﬁcient in the control of the infection, whereas
a Th1 pattern was obtained with two immunizations resulting in
the elimination of P. brasiliensis yeast cells (do Nascimento Martins
et al., 2009).

UNDEFINED SOLUBLE ANTIGENS
Soluble antigens of P. brasiliensis and fractions obtained by ion
exchange chromatography of P. brasiliensis extract (F0, FII, and
FIII), showed variations in the induction of a protective immune
response. Mice immunized with F0 and FII developed benign
chronic PCM restricted to the lung, associated with low mortality
rates and the presence of compact granulomas with few fungal
cells. Signiﬁcant enhancement of IFN-γ and high levels of IgG2a
and IgG3 were found in animals immunized with F0. Immuniza-
tions with FII induced signiﬁcant production of IFN-γ and IL-10
associated with high levels of IgG1 and IgG2a. In contrast, mice
immunized with FIII developed a progressive disease with dis-
semination to spleen and liver. These animals did not control the
spread of the fungus showing granulomas with a high number of
viable fungal cells (Diniz et al., 2004). A fraction of approximately
380 kDa designated high-molecular-mass (hMM) fraction was

able to induce lymphocyte proliferation and production of IFN-γ
but not IL-4 when incubated with spleen cells from BALB/c mice
infected intravenous with P. brasiliensis (isolate Pb18). Animals
previously immunized s.c. with hMM and infected with virulent
yeast cells showed a signiﬁcant reduction of the fungal burden in
the lungs and spleen (Pavanelli et al., 2007).

PURIFIED ANTIGEN AND PEPTIDE
The major diagnostic antigen gp43 was isolated from P. brasiliensis
culture supernatant ﬂuids in 1986 (Puccia et al., 1986). It reacted
with antibodies from virtually 100% of patients with PMC, except
some patients exposed to P. lutzii, who showed irregular reactivity
to gp43 (Batista et al., 2010). Epitopes in gp43 that elicit a strong
antibody response are peptidic in nature (Puccia and Travassos,
1991) and different isoforms of gp43 vary in their reactivity with
patients sera. The gp43 gene was cloned and sequenced (Cisalpino
et al., 1996); gene expression and polymorphism have been shown
(Travassos et al., 2004a,b).

+

The ﬁrst evidence that gp43 carried an immunodominant
epitope able to elicit DTH reactions was shown in guinea pigs
(Rodrigues and Travassos, 1994) and later in patients (Saraiva
et al., 1996) using the puriﬁed antigen. The T cell epitope respon-
sible for DTH reactions, and CD4
T cell proliferation, was
mapped to a peptide called P10 with the sequence QTLIAIHT-
LAIRYAN (Taborda et al., 1998). The hexapeptide HTLAIR has
been shown to be essential for priming the cellular immune
response. In P. lutzii, there is, however, an important mutation
in this hexapeptide (Teixeira et al., 2009). Peptide P10 showed to
be promiscuous in its presentation by MHC class II molecules
from three different mouse haplotypes (Taborda et al., 1998). This
was extended to most Caucasian HLA-DR molecules (Iwai et al.,
2003). By using the TEPITOPE algorithm neighboring peptides to
P10 were also recognized with high afﬁnity HLA-DR binding (Iwai
et al., 2007). The protective effect of P10 using complete Freund’s
adjuvant (CFA) against intratracheally infected mice is shown in
Figure 1.

The association of peptide P10 immunization and chemother-
apy was tested in i.t. infected BALB/c mice using two protocols.
Mice infected with yeast cells of the highly virulent P. brasilien-
sis (Pb18) underwent P10 and/or drug treatment starting after
48 h or 30 days of infection. The treatment continued for 30
days, during which groups of mice received intraperitoneal doses
of itraconazole, ﬂuconazole, ketoconazole, sulfamethoxazole, or
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole every 24 h. Amphotericin B was
administered every 48 h. Immunization with P10 was carried out
weekly for 4 weeks, once in CFA and three times in incomplete
Freund’s adjuvant (Marques et al., 2006). Animals were sacriﬁced
at different times of infection and signiﬁcant reduction in the fun-
gal load was observed in both groups, with an additive protective
effect obtained with the combination of P10 and antifungal drugs
(Marques et al., 2006). Unexpectedly, animals treated with sul-
famethoxazole, showed early protection followed by relapse, but
the association of sulfamethoxazole and P10 vaccination success-
fully controlled the infection. The detection of cytokines in lung
homogenates from mice vaccinated with P10, showed a typical
Th1 response, rich in IFN-γ and IL-12 but without suppression of
Th2 cytokines (Marques et al., 2006).

Vaccine against paracoccidioidomycosis

by P. brasiliensis Pb18 strain in mice immunized with P10 in presence
of Freund’s complete adjuvant (CFA). Tissue samples were collected
two months after i.t. challenge with the Pb18 strain. (A) Lung section
from infected mouse, with a granuloma containing multiple viable fungal
cells; (B) Lung section from mouse treated with CFA, showing the

extensive granulomatous lesion with intense cellular inﬁltration and
large number of multiplying fungal cells; (C) Lung section from mouse
immunized with P10 admixed with CFA showing preserved alveolar
structure, absence of granulomatous lesions as well as of fungal
cells. All sections were ampliﬁed 10-fold and stained with
hematoxylin–eosin.

In an attempt to reproduce a general anergic state, BALB/c
mice were treated with dexamethasone-21 phosphate added to the
drinking water. After 30 days animals showed negative DTH to
fungal antigens. Mice were then infected with virulent P. brasilien-
sis (Pb18) and after 15 days were subjected to chemotherapy and/or
P10 immunization. The association of drugs and P10 immu-
nization conferred additive protection. A signiﬁcant increase in
IL-12 and IFN-γ and decrease of IL-4 and IL-10 were observed in
mice immunized with P10 alone or in association with antifungal
drugs, indicating that also in this case of immune suppression, P10
immunization can be helpful (Marques et al., 2008).

Different ways of peptide delivery using formulations that did
not include CFA have also been investigated. The ﬁrst attempt
involved a multiple antigen peptide (MAP) construction. A
tetramer of truncated P10 was designated M10 and had four equal
LIAIHTLAIRYAN (N-terminal QT-less P10) chains synthesized on
a branched lysine core containing glycine at the C-terminal posi-
tion. Mice immunized with a single dose of M10 without adjuvant
and challenged intratracheally with P. brasiliensis showed signiﬁ-
cantly fewer lung, spleen, and liver CFUs and few or no yeasts in
lung sections histopathology (Taborda et al., 2004).

The therapeutic or prophylactic protective effect of P10 was also
tested with the peptide admixed with different adjuvants, bacte-
rial ﬂagellin, aluminum hydroxide, cationic lipid in comparison
with CFA. A vaccine formulation based on intranasal administra-
tions of gp43 or P10 with the Salmonella enterica FliC ﬂagellin was
evaluated in BALB/c mice. Animals were immunized with recom-
binant puriﬁed ﬂagellins genetically fused with P10, either or not
ﬂanked by two lysine residues, or with the synthetic P10 admixed
with puriﬁed FliC. After the last immunization, mice were i.t.
infected with P. brasiliensis (Pb18). BALB/c mice immunized with
the chimeric ﬂagellins and particularly those immunized with P10
admixed with FliC had reduced fungal burden in the lungs and
elicited a predominantly Th1-type immune response (Braga et al.,
2009). Other adjuvants were also compared in terms of protective
immune response to P10 immunization. Reduction of the pul-
monary fungal burden was obtained with aluminum hydroxide,
CFA, ﬂagellin, and cationic lipid in intratracheal infected BALB/c

mice. The cationic lipid proved to be very efﬁcient in the clearance
of fungal load and reduction of ﬁbrotic areas in the lung (Mayorga
et al., 2012).

The combination of P10 with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim
entrapped within poly- (lactic acid–glycolic acid) nanoparticles
(PLGA) was tested in the experimental therapeutic protocol of
PCM. The incorporation of P10 into PLGA reduced the amount
of this peptide necessary to decrease the fungal
load in the
infected animals and avoid disease relapse when compared with
P10 emulsiﬁed in Freund’s adjuvant (Amaral et al., 2010).

The potential use of the recombinant protein of 27 kDa (rPb27),
present in the soluble fraction F0 (Reis et al., 2008), has been
investigated. Immunization of rPb27 in the presence of Propi-
onibacterium acnes and aluminum hydroxide prior to intravenous
infection by the orbital plexus with virulent P. brasiliensis (Pb18),
was able to efﬁciently protect BALB/c mice. Recently, another
recombinant protein, rPb40, was used associated with ﬂuconazole
and shown to reduce the fungal burden in the lungs of BALB/c
mice (Fernandes et al., 2011, 2012).

DNA VACCINE AND IMMUNOTHERAPY WITH
DENDRITIC CELLS
Immunization of BALB/c mice with a mammalian expression vec-
tor (VR-gp43) carrying the full gene of gp43 with CMV promoter
induced B and T cell-mediated immune responses protective
against the intratracheal challenge by virulent P. brasiliensis yeast
forms. The cellular immune response in mice immunized with VR-
gp43 induced IFN-γ and the response was maintained for at least 6
months although reduced to half of the stimulation index obtained
15 days after immunization (Pinto et al., 2000). In order to develop
a more speciﬁc DNA vaccine based predominantly on a T cell-
mediated immune response, a plasmid encoding the P10 minigene
in pcDNA3 expression vector was tested in intratracheally infected
BALB/c and B10.A mice. The vaccination with plasmid encod-
ing P10 induced a signiﬁcant reduction in the fungal burden in
the lung. Co-vaccination with a plasmid encoding mouse IL-12
proved to be even more effective in the elimination of the fungus
with virtual sterilization in the long-term infection and treatment

assay, using the more susceptible B10.A mice. The immunization
elicited signiﬁcant production of IL-12 and IFN-γ (Rittner et al.,
2012). Such immunization with plasmid encoding P10 induced
memory cells as well as T regulatory cells (Amorim, 2010), that
might help reduce the tissue cell damage of the protective immune
response.

The use of heterologous DNA plasmid encoding HSP65 from
Mycobacterium leprae was used in a prophylactic protocol. Intra-
muscular immunization with DNAhsp65 induced an increase of
Th1 cytokine levels and reduction of the fungal burden with
marked reduction of collagen and lung remodeling (Ribeiro et al.,
2009). Similar results were obtained with a therapeutic model
(Ribeiro et al., 2010).
A competent CD4

T cell response producing IFN-γ is usually
the chief protective mechanism in fungal infections, particularly in
PCM, and dendritic cells are able to initiate the response in naïve
T cells.

+

The use of transfected DCs with a plasmid (pMAC/PS-scFv)
encoding a single chain variable fragment (scFv) of an anti-Id
antibody that is capable of mimicking gp43 from P. brasiliensis
was used to subcutaneously immunize BALB/c mice. After 7 days,
the scFv peptide was presented to the regional lymph node cells
and was capable to activate proliferation resulting in a decrease of
fungal burden (Ferreira et al., 2011).

Using an experimental model in BALB/c mice, P10-primed
DCs were administrated prior to (subcutaneous vaccination) or
weeks after (subcutaneous or intravenous injection) P. brasiliensis
infection, and showed to signiﬁcantly reduce the fungal burden.
The protective response mediated by the injection of primed-DCs
was mainly characterized by increased production of IFN-γ and
IL-12 and reduction in IL-10 and IL-4 compared to infected mice
that received saline or unprimed-DCs (Magalhães et al., 2012).

PASSIVE TRANSFERENCE OF ANTIBODIES
The exacerbated humoral immune response in PCM has been
associated to a poor prognosis since patients with acute and sub-
acute forms of the disease show high antibody titers. It has been
reported, however, that monoclonal antibodies against gp70 were
protective against experimental PCM (Mattos Grosso et al., 2003).
The same group of researchers also showed that a monoclonal

antibody against surface 75 kDa protein was able to inhibit fun-
gal growth (Xander et al., 2007). The protective effect of anti-gp43
mAbs injected intraperitoneally on the i.t. infection by P. brasilien-
sis was examined in BALB/c mice (Buissa-Filho et al., 2008).
Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, protective and non-
protective monoclonal antibodies with similar reactivity with gp43
on ELISA, were found. The reactivity of mAb 3E, the most efﬁ-
cient mAb in the reduction of fungal burden, that was able to
enhance phagocytosis, was mapped to the sequence NHVRIPIGY-
WAV (Buissa-Filho et al., 2008). This peptide could thus represent,
together with P10, another candidate for a peptide vaccine against
PCM. In a P10-pre-immunization protocol, mAbs were tested
as protective agents. The association of P10-pre-immunization
and mAb 3E administered 24 h before i.t. challenge with virulent
P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii yeasts, resulted in additive protection
using short-term protocols in comparison with a non-protective
mAb (data not published).

FINAL REMARKS
While chemotherapy has the chief role of reducing the fungal bur-
den in mycotic infections, the long-term control and eventual
sterilization involve an effective immune response. The combina-
tion of chemotherapy and an effective vaccine against PCM should
ideally treat the more serious cases of the systemic mycosis aim-
ing at a shorter period of treatment, prevention of relapses and
of ﬁbrotic sequels. A highly immunogenic antigen of P. brasilien-
sis and the peptide containing a T cell epitope have repeatedly
proved to be protective in prophylactic and therapeutic mod-
els with massively infected mice. A new peptide also from the
gp43 contains a B cell epitope that reacts with a protective mon-
oclonal antibody. Recently, a DNA vaccine expressing the P10
peptide showed a remarkable protective effect in a long-term infec-
tion protocol using mice highly susceptible to PCM. Immunized
mice had memory T cells as well as T regulatory cells that pre-
vented tissue cell damage due to the initial pro-inﬂammatory
protective response involving T effector cells. These encourag-
ing results, along with other protective immunizations using new
adjuvants, delivery systems, and dendritic cells, point to a next
stage of experimentation aiming at the clinical use of the peptide
vaccines.
