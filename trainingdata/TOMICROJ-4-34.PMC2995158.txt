Abstract:  Successful  treatment  of  inhalation  anthrax,  pneumonic  plague  and  tularemia  can  be  achieved  with  fluoroqui-
nolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, and initiation of treatment is most effective when administered 
as soon as possible following exposure. Bacillus anthracis Ames, Yersinia pestis CO92, and Francisella tularensis SCHU 
S4  have  equivalent  susceptibility  in  vitro  to  ciprofloxacin  and  levofloxacin  (minimal  inhibitory  concentration  is  0.03 
Î¼g/ml); however, limited information is available regarding in vivo susceptibility of these infectious agents to the fluoro-
quinolone  antibiotics  in  small  animal  models.  Mice,  guinea  pig,  and  rabbit  models  have  been  developed  to  evaluate  the 
protective efficacy of antibiotic therapy against these life-threatening infections. Our results indicated that doses of cipro-
floxacin and levofloxacin required to protect mice against inhalation anthrax were approximately 18-fold higher than the 
doses  of  levofloxacin  required  to  protect  against  pneumonic  plague  and  tularemia.  Further,  the  critical  period  following 
aerosol  exposure  of  mice  to  either  B.  anthracis  spores  or  Y.  pestis  was  24  h,  while  mice  challenged  with  F.  tularensis 
could be effectively protected when treatment was delayed for as long as 72 h postchallenge. In addition, it was apparent 
that prolonged antibiotic  treatment was important  in the effective treatment of inhalation anthrax in mice, but short-term 
treatment of mice with pneumonic plague or tularemia infections were usually successful. These results provide effective 
antibiotic dosages in mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits and lay the foundation for the development and evaluation of combi-
national treatment modalities.

INTRODUCTION 

  Antibiotics  are  still  considered  to  be  the  most  effective 
therapeutic regimen  in  the treatment of patients with  inhala-
tion anthrax, pneumonic plague, and tularemia, although new 
treatment  modalities,  for  example,  with  human  monoclonal 
antibodies  against  protective  antigen  (PA)  of  Bacillus  an-
thracis  [1-5]  and  antitoxic  drugs  [6-8]  are  being  developed, 
along  with  new  second  generation  prophylactic  vaccines  [9-
11]. It is likely that new therapeutics against these infections 
would be used in combination with effective antibiotics, and 
knowing  dose  and  blood  concentrations  in  different  labora-
tory  animal  species  would  be  essential  for  combinational

studies  in  small  animal  models.  Currently,  two  antibiotics 
have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion  for  the  treatment  of  inhalation  anthrax,  ciprofloxacin 
and  levofloxacin.  Anthrax  also  can  be  effectively  treated 
with  other  antibiotics  including  penicillin,  tetracycline  and 
streptomycin.  Likewise,  streptomycin, tetracycline,  and gen-
tamicin are antibiotics of choice against plague and tularemia 
[12-15].  Although  currently,  there  is  no  available  vaccine 
against  plague,  a  recombinant  vaccine  containing  capsular 
antigen (F1) and low calcium response antigen V (LcrV) has 
shown  promising  results  in  mouse  and  non-human  primate 
models  [16,  17].  Likewise,  a  live  attenuated  vaccine  strain 
(LVS)  of  F.  tularensis  is  approved  for  vaccination  of  mili-
tary  personnel  and  those  investigators  working  with  this 
pathogen [18]. 

  The  fluoroquinolones  exhibit  extensive  tissue  penetra-
tion,  concentration-dependent  killing  and  a  prolonged  post-
antibiotic  effect  against  susceptible  bacteria  [19].  Pharma-

codynamic data from in vitro, large animal, and human stud-
ies  suggest  that  fluoroquinolone  efficacy  is  associated  with 
achieving  a  maximum  serum  concentration  (Cmax)  to  mini-
mum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  ratio  (Cmax/MIC)  of 
>10  and  area  under  the  24-hour  serum  concentration-time 
curve  to  MIC  ratio  (AUC/MIC)  of  >125  for  most  gram-
negative bacteria [19-21]. For most gram-positive organisms, 
a lower 24-hour AUC/MIC ratio of >25 is required for opti-
mal  bacterial  eradication  [22].  Published  pharmacodynamic 
data involving fluoroquinolones against B. anthracis [23-25] 
Y. pestis [26-28], or F. tularensis [29-31] are  mostly limited 
to  murine  models;  however,  fluoroquinolone  data  against 
anthrax  derived  from  in  vitro  modeling  studies  [32,  33]  and 
nonhuman primate models [34-36] have been reported.  

inhalation 

 
From  a  recent  study  conducted  by  Ambrose  and  col-
leagues [23] evaluating gatifloxacin in a murine model of B. 
anthracis 
infection,  it  was  shown  that  the 
AUC24/MIC  ratio  is  the  pharmacodynamic  parameter  that 
best  predicts  outcome  with  90%  and  99%  effective  doses 
corresponding  to  AUC24/MIC  ratios  of  15.8  and  30,  respec-
tively.  These  degrees  of  fluoroquinolone  exposure  that  pre-
dict a desirable outcome in mice correspond to a AUC24/MIC 
ratio of about 200-300 in humans [37]. Among the few stud-
ies  of  fluoroquinolone  administration  in  the  guinea  pig  and 
rabbit  models  of  inhalation  anthrax  are  reports  by  Altboum 
et  al.  [38],  Shoop  et  al.  [39],  and  Peterson  et  al.  [4].  Since 
these are  important small animal models for development of 
new  treatment  modalities  against  anthrax,  plague,  and  tula-
remia, the current findings provide important information on 
dosing and blood levels of the fluoroquinolones useful in the 
development of adjunctive therapies [37, 40, 41]. 

 
In  addition  to  their  direct  antimicrobial  effects,  it  is  well 
recognized  that  fluoroquinolones  possess  potent  concentra-
tion-dependent  immunomodulatory  properties  [42].  In  par-
ticular, they have been shown to protect mice from lipopoly-
saccharide  (LPS)-induced  death,  presumably  by  decreasing 
the  production/secretion  of  proinflammatory  mediators  such 
as  tumor  necrosis  factor-alpha  (TNF-(cid:2)),  interleukins  (IL)-1 
(cid:2)/(cid:1),  -6,  -8  and  -12  [43,  44].  Further,  enhancement  of  hema-
topoietic stimulating factors  such  as IL-2, IL-33  and pulmo-
nary production of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulat-
ing  factor  (GM-CSF)  has  been  associated  with  fluoroqui-
nolone  treatment  in  various  animal  models  [45,  46].  The 
underlying mechanisms of these immunomodulatory proper-
ties  are  not  well  defined,  but  may  involve  their  effects  on 
signal transduction, intracellular transcription factors, and/or 
interactions with the type II topoisomerase complex [42]. 

 
In  this  report,  we  chose  the  nasal  instillation  models  of 
inhalation  anthrax with Swiss-Webster  mice, Hartley guinea 
pigs,  and  Dutch-belted  rabbits  to  evaluate  the  protection  af-
forded  by  ciprofloxacin  and  levofloxacin.  Similarly,  we 
evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  levofloxacin  against  pneu-
monic  plague  and  tularemia  using  murine  models.  For  the 
latter  two  diseases,  we  preferred  to  use  only  levofloxacin  as 
our  studies  with  anthrax  indicated  that  it  was  as  efficacious 
or  better  than  ciprofloxacin  and  could  be  given  to  animals 
only  once  per  day  compared  to  ciprofloxacin  that  needed  to 
be  given  to  animals  twice  because  of  its  shorter  half  life. 
Pharmacokinetic  studies  in  all  three  animal  models  were 
designed  to  provide  information  about  the  blood  levels  of 
both  antibiotics  in  the  animals  challenged  with  these  patho-

gens.  The  results  may  be  beneficial  as  a  guide  to  health 
authorities  in  selecting  antibiotic  dose  levels  for  patients  in 
the event of future acts of bioterrorism involving these select 
agents. 

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY 

Antibiotics 

 
Sterile,  injectable  formulations  of  ciprofloxacin  (Bayer 
Pharmaceuticals  Corp.,  West  Haven,  CT)  and  levofloxacin 
(Janssen  Pharmaceutica,  N.V.,  Beerse,  Belgium)  were  pur-
chased  from  the  UTMB  Pharmacy.  Although  normally  in-
fused  intravenously  into  patients  as  5%  levofloxacin  and 
0.2%  ciprofloxacin  in  5%  dextrose  solution,  respectively, 
animals in this study were injected with the antibiotics by the 
subcutaneous  or  intraperitoneal  routes  in  the  amounts  indi-
cated in the Results section. 

MIC  of  Ciprofloxacin  and  Levofloxacin  Against  B.  
anthracis, Y. pestis, and F. tularenesis 

  The  MIC  of  ciprofloxacin  and  levofloxacin  against  vari-
ous pathogens was determined by using the E-Test (AB Bio-
disk  North  America  Inc,  Culver  City,  CA)  [47].  Briefly,  the 
overnight-grown  bacterial  cultures  were  diluted  (1:4)  with 
fresh  Luria-Bertani  (LB)  medium  and  continued  to  grow  at 
28Â°C  for  Y.  pestis  CO92  and  37oC  for  B.  anthracies  Ames 
and  F.  tularenesis  SCHU  S4  for  2  h  (OD600nm  of  0.6).  The 
bacterial cultures were then spread evenly onto the Muellerâ
Hinton agar plates (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD) or 
on  5%  sheep  blood  agar  (SBA)  plates  (Teknova,  Hollister, 
CA),  and  the  predefined  levofloxacin  (range  of  0.002  to  32 
(cid:1)g/ml)  E-strips  were  placed  onto  the  plates.  Plates  were  in-
cubated for 48 h at either 28Â°C or 37oC, and the MIC values 
were recorded. 

Preparation of B. anthracis spores 

 
Spores  were  prepared  by  inoculating  B.  anthracis  Ames 
strain  in  Schaeffer's  sporulation  medium  [48]  as  we  previ-
ously described [7]. We confirmed sporulation to be at >99% 
via phase contrast microscopy and the Wirtz spore stain [49]. 
Aliquots  of  the  stock  spore  suspension  (1  x  109  to  1  x  1010 
cfu/ml)  were  stored  at  â70oC,  and  freshly  diluted  in  phos-
phate-buffered  saline  (PBS)  to  the  desired  colony  forming 
units  (cfu)  immediately  before  each  animal  challenge  ex-
periment.  

Preparation of Y. pestis CO92 culture 

  Virulent  Y.  pestis  strain  CO92  was  obtained  from  the 
Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, 
GA.  To  prepare  Y.  pestis  cultures,  we  followed  our  recently 
described protocol [50, 51].  

  B.  anthracis  cultures  and  spores  as  well  as Y.  pestis  cul-
tures  were  prepared  and  stored  in  a  restricted  access  BSL-2 
laboratory  registered  with  the  CDC  and  inspected  by  the 
Department of Defense and the United States Department of 
Agriculture. 

Preparation of F. tularenesis SCHU S4 culture 

  An aliquot of stock was plated on cysteine heart infusion 
agar  (Difco  Laboratories,  Detroit,  MI)  plates  for  2  days  at 

36    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2010, Volume 4 

37Â°C  with  5%  CO2.  Bacterial  colonies  were  expanded  in 
modified  Mueller-Hinton  II  broth  supplemented  with  IsoVi-
taleX  (Becton  Dickinson,  Cockeysville,  MD)  for  10  h  with 
shaking  at  37Â°C.  After  centrifugation,  bacterial  pellets  were 
resuspended in PBS, the cell number determined with a Pet-
roff-Hausser cell counting chamber (Hausser Scientific, Hor-
sham,  PA),  and  adjusted  to  the  desired  concentrations  by 
diluting  in  PBS  [52].  F.  tularenesis  culture  was  stored  and 
cultivated in the CDC approved BSL-3 laboratory. 

Challenge  of  Mice,  Guinea  Pigs,  and  Rabbits  Via  the  
Intranasal Route  

  To  evaluate  the  protective  efficacy  of  ciprofloxacin  and 
levofloxacin in  vivo, we challenged 8-week-old (25 to 30-g) 
female  Swiss-Webster  mice  (Taconic,  Germantown,  NY) 
and 250 to 300-g Hartley guinea pigs (Charles River Labora-
tories, Wilmington, MA) with 5 x 104 cfu and 6 x 105 cfu of 
B. anthracis Ames spores, respectively. Swiss-Webster mice 
were  also  challenged  with  5  LD50  (1.7  x  103)  of  Y.  pestis 
CO92. BALB/c mice were challenged with 3 LD50 (1.7 x 102 
cfu)  doses  of  F.  tularensis  SCHU  S4.  Dutch-belted  rabbits 
(0.7-1.1 kg; Myrtleâs Rabbitry, Inc., Thompson Station, TN) 
were  challenged  with  100  LD50âs  (1  x  107  cfu)  of  B.  an-
thracis Ames spores. 

  Mice  and  guinea  pigs  were  anesthetized  by  intraperito-
neal (i.p.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) routes, respectively, with a 
mixture  of  ketamine-HCl  (48  mg/kg  for  mice  and  30  mg/kg 
for guinea pigs) and xylazine-HCl (9.6 mg/kg for mice and 7 
mg/kg  for  guinea  pigs).  Rabbits  were  anesthetized  with 
ketamine (35 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) by intramuscu-
lar (i.m.) injection. For spore/bacteria instillation in animals, 
we  used  the  method  of  Comer  et  al.  [7].  The  challenge  vol-
ume  was  20  Î¼l/naris  for  mice,  25  Î¼l/naris  for  guinea  pigs, 
and 50 Î¼l/naris for rabbits. PBS (20, 25, and 50 Î¼l/naris) was 
then  used  to  wash  any  non-adherent  spores  from  the  nasal 
cavity  into  the  lungs  for  each  animal  species,  respectively. 
All  animal  challenges  were  performed  in  a  select  agent-
approved,  restricted-access  Animal  Biosafety  Level  3  Labo-
ratory  under  approved  protocols  in  accordance  with  guide-
lines  recommended  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health, 
Centers  for  Disease  Control,  and  United  States  Department 
of  Agriculture.  In  the  animal  studies,  antibiotics  were  given 
24 h post infection or at various delayed time points as indi-
cated for a period of 6-13 days. In mice, the antibiotics were 
given by the i.p. route, in guinea pigs by the s.c. route, while 
in rabbits, antibiotics were injected via the i.m. route. 

Fluoroquinolone Assay 

  All serum specimens were assayed by the reversed-phase 
high-performance  liquid  chromatographic  (HPLC)  method 
with fluorescence detection as previously described [53-54].  

Pharmacokinetic Studies and Analysis 

 
Studies  in  mice  were  performed  using  a  sample  size  of 
n=4 at each time point (e.g., 0, 0.25, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36 
and 48 h) following dose administration of ciprofloxacin (90 
mg/kg [i.p.]) and  levofloxacin (5 and 90 mg/kg [i.p.]). Stud-
ies  in guinea pigs (n=8 per regimen: ciprofloxacin 15 mg/kg 
[s.c.]  and  levofloxacin  8.5  mg/kg  [s.c.])  and  rabbits  (n=10 
per regimen: ciprofloxacin 10 mg/kg [i.m.]; levofloxacin 7.1 
mg/kg  [i.m.])  were  conducted,  which  provided  n=6  serum 

Peterson et al. 

concentrations  over  the  48  h  time  period.  The  dose  of  each 
fluoroquinolone was based on the effective dose for 100% of 
the animals (ED100) as determined from the survival studies. 

  The  serum  concentration-time  data  were  analyzed  by 
standard  noncompartmental  methods  [55].  The  maximum 
concentration  (Cmax)  in  serum  and  the  time  to  reach  Cmax 
(Tmax)  were  determined  directly  from  the  individual  concen-
tration  data.  The  terminal  elimination  rate  constant  ((cid:3)z)  was 
obtained  by  least-squares  regression  of  the  log  serum  drug 
concentrations  in  the  log-linear  phase.  A  minimum  of  three 
concentration-time  points  were  used  to  represent  the  log-
linear phase for rabbits and guinea pigs in which each animal 
provided  multiple  serum  specimens  for  concentration  deter-
mination. Composite data were used to assess this parameter 
in  mice.  The  elimination  half-life  (t(cid:2))  was  calculated  by  di-
viding  0.693  by  (cid:3)z.  The  area  under  the  concentration-time 
curve  for  ciprofloxacin  and  levofloxacin  from  time  zero 
(predose)  to  infinity  (AUC0-(cid:1))  was  calculated  by  the  linear 
trapezoidal  rule  with  extrapolation  to  infinity,  using  Ct/(cid:3)z, 
where  Ct  is  the  last  measurable  concentration.  The  apparent 
total  body  clearance  (TBC)  was  calculated  by  the  adminis-
tered dose divided by AUC0-(cid:1). 

Statistics 

  All  of  the  animal  survival  data  were  analyzed  with  the 
Fisherâs  exact  test  using  the  SigmaStat  Statistical  package 
(SYSTAT, Richmond, CA). Pharmacokinetic parameters for 
ciprofloxacin  and  levofloxacin  within  species  were  com-
pared  using  the  Studentâs  t-test  unless  normality  failed  in 
which  case  the  nonparametric  Mann-Whitney  rank  sum  test 
was employed. All statistical tests were performed at the 5% 
level  of  significance.  Results  were  expressed  as  means  Â± 
standard deviations, with the exception of Tmax values, which 
were given as the median (range).  

RESULTS  

LD50 doses for B. anthracis, Y. pestis, and F. tularensis 

  Table  1  lists  the  LD50  doses  of  the  above-mentioned 
agents  in  Swiss-Webster  and  BALB/c  mice.  These  three  
bacterial  pathogens  could  be  ranked  in  order  of  decreasing 
infectivity  based  on  LD50  dose  in  a  murine  model;  F.  tu-
larensis  >  Y.  pestis  >  B.  anthracis.  Based  on  these  data,  
we  elected  to  use  Swiss-Webster  mice  for  the  study  of  
B.  anthracis  and  Y.  pestis,  while  the  increased  sensitivity  
of  BALB/c  mice  influenced  our  selection  of  this  species  
for  the  study  of  F.  tularensis.  Also  shown  are  the  LD50  
values  of  B.  anthracis  Ames  spores  for  Hartley  guinea  pigs 
and Dutch-belted rabbits. 

Ciprofloxacin  and  Levofloxacin  Protect  Mice  Against 
Inhalation Exposure to B. anthracis Ames spores 

 
Fig.  (1A)  illustrates  that  administration  of  ciprofloxacin 
in  doses  of  90-120  mg/kg/day  (b.i.d.)  was  required  to 
achieve  complete  protection  during  treatment  of  Swiss-
Webster mice against challenge with 5 LD50 of  B. anthracis 
spores,  but  sustained  treatment  was  essential.  The  highest 
dose of 180 mg/kg/day appeared to reach a toxic level, since 
survival  decreased  compared  to  that  of  90-120  mg/kg/day 
doses.  Ciprofloxacin  doses  of  60  mg/kg/day  or  below  were 
not  protective.  Interestingly,  even  relatively  high  doses  of

Fig. (1). A. Protection afforded to Swiss-Webster mice by various doses of ciprofloxacin initiated 24 h after intranasal challenge with 5 LD50 
of  B.  anthracis  Ames  spores.  One-half  the  daily  dose  was  administered  every  12  h.  The  LD50  dose  was  previously  determined  in  the  nasal 
instillation model [4]. The horizontal bar indicates the period of ciprofloxacin treatment (6 days). The two highest doses were significant from 
days  2  through  11.5,  while  90  mg/kg/day  was  significant  from  days  2  through  16.5.  Significance  for  the  60  mg/kg/day  group  was  delayed 
until day 3.5 and only remained so until day 4.5. Significance at 30 mg/kg/day was only at days 2 and 2.5, while the lowest dose showed no 
significance. B. Protection afforded to Swiss-Webster mice by various doses of levofloxacin. The daily dose was administered once every 24 
h. The horizontal bar indicates the period of levofloxacin treatment (13 days). All groups, except the lowest dose, was significant beginning at 
day 2 and continued through the end of the study. Significance from the control was determined by the Fisher Exact Test (p<0.05).

ciprofloxacin  that  were  completely  protective  during  short-
term therapy failed to provide long-term  survival once treat-
ment  ceased.  Within  the  period  of  treatment,  a  dose  of  ap-
proximately 70 mg/kg/day was the ED50 for ciprofloxacin in 
these  mice;  however,  mouse  deaths  occurred  after  antibiotic 
administration ceased. 

  During 
treatment,  doses  of  90-120  mg/kg/day  of 
levofloxacin  were  completely  protective  for  Swiss-Webster 
mice  challenged  with  5  LD50  of  B.  anthracis  Ames  spores 
(Fig. 1B). Like for ciprofloxacin, some toxicity of the antibi-
otic  was  noted  at  the  highest  dose  of  180  mg/kg/day. 
Levofloxacin  in  doses  of  30-60  mg/kg/day  provided  ap-
proximately  70%  protection,  while  the  lowest  dose  of  15 
mg/kg/day of levofloxacin was ineffective. Further, as noted 
with ciprofloxacin, once treatment with higher doses ceased, 
mice began to die of anthrax. In this study, we opted to treat 
animals  for  13  days  with  levofloxacin,  although  in  our  sub-
sequent  experiments,  we  reduced  the  treatment  time  to  6 
days with similar results. 

Protection  of  Hartley  Guinea  Pigs  Against  Inhalation 
Anthrax with Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin 

  All  guinea  pigs  challenged  with  5  LD50  of  B.  anthracis 
Ames spores were completely protected while being injected 
with  doses  of  ciprofloxacin  equal  to  or  greater  than  15 
mg/kg/day;  however,  deaths  began  to  occur  6  days  after  the 
antibiotic  treatment  ceased  (Fig.  2).  Identical  protection  re-
sults were observed in other guinea pigs challenged with 25 
LD50 of B. anthracis spores (data not shown). By titrating the 
antibiotic  dose,  we  were  able  to  establish  a  threshold,  non-
protective dose (3.7 mg/kg/day), which we have used in syn-
ergy  studies  with  other  treatment  modalities  [4].  We  were 
unable  to  establish  an  ED50  dose  of  ciprofloxacin  in  guinea 
pigs against inhalation anthrax, since regardless of antibiotic 
dose, all animals eventually succumbed to the infection after 
treatment  ceased;  however,  during  treatment  the  ED50  was 
estimated to be 8.8 mg/kg/day.

  Levofloxacin  provided  80%  protection  to  guinea  pigs, 
during  sustained  treatment  with  doses  8.5-17  mg/kg/day 
against  inhalation  anthrax;  however,  the  lowest  dose  of 
levofloxacin (e.g., 4.2 mg/kg/day) was ineffective in protect-
ing  the  animals  during  treatment.  Upon  cessation  of  treat-
ment at 6 days, death of most of the animals ensued even at 
higher doses of 8.5 and 17 mg/kg/day (data not shown). 

Protection  of  Dutch-Belted  Rabbits  Against  Inhalation 
Anthrax with Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin 

Fig.  (3A)  depicts  the  amount  of  protection  afforded  to 
 
rabbits  against  inhalation  anthrax  using  100  LD50  of  B.  an-
thracis spores when various doses of ciprofloxacin were ad-
ministered  24  h  post-challenge  for  6  days.  A  10  mg/kg/day 
dose regimen of ciprofloxacin provided 80% protection. Un-
like  the  results  obtained  in  similar  experiments  with  mice 
and  guinea  pigs,  cessation  of  short-term  treatment  with 
ciprofloxacin did not result in increased mortality. The ED50 
of  ciprofloxacin  against  inhalation  anthrax  in  the  rabbit 
model  was  7.5  mg/kg/day  (Table  3);  however,  due  to  the 
short  half-life  of  the  drug,  ciprofloxacin  was  given  twice 
each day. 

  As  shown  in  Fig.  (3B),  levofloxacin  was  equal  to  or 
slightly better than ciprofloxacin in protecting rabbits against 
inhalation anthrax, and the drug could be given once per day. 
A levofloxacin dose of >7 mg/kg/day was completely protec-
tive. The ED50 of levofloxacin against anthrax in rabbits was 
determined to be 4.0 mg/kg/day (Table 3) when given by the 
s.c. route. Like for ciprofloxacin, we did not observe further 
deaths  after  cessation  of  the  levofloxacin  treatment.  Fig.  (4) 
shows  the  effect  of  delaying  treatment  with  levofloxacin  in 
the  rabbit  model  against  inhalation  anthrax.  In  this  study, 
levofloxacin  treatment  was  initiated  at  various  times  post 
challenge and continued for 13 days. Complete protection of 
the  rabbits  was  achieved  during  the  13  days  of  treatment, 
when  initiated  24  h  post  challenge,  but  dropped  to  83%  (1 
death) after treatment ceased. In comparison, when initiation

nificant starting at day 3 and continuing through the end of the study. Significance for the 5 mg/kg/day group only lasted for days 2.5 and 3, 
while the two lowest doses were not significant. Significance from the control was determined by the Fisher Exact Test (p<0.05). B. Survival

of  treatment  was  delayed  until  48  h  postinfection,  survival 
dropped to 40% during treatment and was maintained at this 
level  until  the  end  of  the  study.  Further  delay  in  initiating 
levofloxacin  treatment  as  late  as  57,  72,  or  96  h  was  com-
pletely  ineffective  in  protecting  the  rabbits. We  preferred  to 
treat  the  animals  with  levofloxacin  for  13  days  in  this  ex-
periment  for  its  protective  effects  as  the  antibiotic  treatment 
was delayed after challenge. 

Levofloxacin  Protects Mice  Against  Inhalation  Exposure 
to Y. pestis CO92 

Swiss-Webster  mice  were  challenged  with  5  LD50  of  Y. 
 
pestis, and 24 h postinfection were injected by the i.p. route 
with  various  doses  (0.1-15  mg/kg/day)  of  levofloxacin  for  6 
days.  Complete  protection  of  the  mice  against  pneumonic 

plague  was  achieved  with  doses  of  levofloxacin  equal  to  or 
greater than 5 mg/kg/day, and 1 mg/kg/day yielded 80% pro-
tection.  No  protection  of  animals  was  observed  at  lower 
doses of levofloxacin (0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg/day) with 5 LD50 of 
Y. pestis CO92 (Fig. 5A). The ED50 of levofloxacin for com-
pletely  protecting  mice  against  pneumonic  plague  was  0.7 
mg/kg/day (Table 3).  

  Even  though  initiation  of  the  6  day  levofloxacin  treat-
ment (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) was delayed as late as 24 h post-
challenge  with  Y.  pestis  (Fig.  5B),  100%  of  the  mice  sur-
vived;  whereas,  90%  survival  was  observed  when  treatment 
with  levofloxacin  was  delayed  as  late  as  36  h.  In  contrast,  a 
delay  in  treatment  with  levofloxacin  as  late  as  48  h  resulted 
in only 10-20% survival.

LD50 B. anthracis Ames spores by nasal instillation. Levofloxacin was given for 13 days following the challenge of each group. Groups that 
initiated treatment at 24 and 48 h, were significant beginning at day 3, however, the 48 h group was only significant until day 7, while the 24 
h group was significant through the end of the study. All other groups were not significant. Significance from the control was determined by 
the Fisher Exact Test (p<0.05). 

Levofloxacin  Protects Mice  Against  Inhalation  Exposure 
to F. tularensis SCHU S4 

mean elimination half lives of both agents ranged from 1.4 to 
2.8 hours in all three species. 

 
Fig.  (6A)  shows  that  13  days  of  levofloxacin  treatment, 
initiated  24  h  post-challenge,  in  concentrations  (0.5-10 
mg/kg/day)  completely  protected  the  mice  against  tularemia 
during  treatment.  After  treatment  with  levofloxacin  at  1 
mg/kg/day  ceased,  a  death  occurred.  At  the  lowest  dose  of 
0.1  mg/kg/day,  animals  succumbed  to  infection  during  the 
antibiotic  treatment,  which  progressively  increased  to  50% 
survival  (Table  3)  after  cessation  of  antibiotic  therapy.  We 
preferred  13  days  of  antibiotic  treatment  as  F.  tularenesis  is 
an  intracellular  pathogen,  and  we  suspected  that  longer 
treatment might be required for observing protection. 

 
Fig.  (6B)  illustrates  that  initiation  of  levofloxacin  treat-
ment  (40  mg/kg/day)  for  13  days  in  mice  infected  with  F. 
tularensis  could  be  delayed  as  long  as  72  h  postchallenge 
and  still  achieve  100%  protection.  Even  when  levofloxacin 
treatment was delayed as late as 96 h, 80% of the mice sur-
vived; however, delay until 120 h resulted in no protection. 

Pharmacokinetics  and  ED50/ED100  of  Ciprofloxacin  and 
Levofloxacin 

  Table  2  lists  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  cipro-
floxacin and levofloxacin for each of the three models based 
on  ED100  dosing.  Within  each  animal  species,  the  Cmax, 
AUCs,  elimination  T(cid:1),  and  TBC  values  were  remarkably 
similar  between  the  two  fluoroquinolones,  despite  the 
slightly  higher  milligram  per  kilogram  dose  required  for 
ciprofloxacin  to  achieve  the  same  efficacy  in  the  guinea  pig 
and  rabbit  models.  The  only  significantly  different  parame-
ters  included  higher  peak  serum  concentrations  of  levoflox-
acin compared to ciprofloxacin (45.2 Â± 10.3 Î¼g/ml vs. 25.5 Â± 
10.3 Î¼g/ml, P < 0.001) in mice receiving the same 90 mg/kg 
dose and a longer T(cid:1) of levofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in 
the rabbit model (2.8 Â± 1.2 h vs 1.5 Â± 0.7 h, P = 0.009). The 

  Table  3  shows  a  summary  of  the  antibiotic  dose  protec-
tion data providing ED50 and ED100 values against inhalation 
anthrax  in  the  three  different  animal  models.  The  ED50  val-
ues  for  ciprofloxacin  and  levofloxacin  against  inhalation 
anthrax  in  Swiss-Webster  mice  were  70  and  28  mg/kg/day, 
respectively.  When  ciprofloxacin  and  levofloxacin  were 
tested against anthrax in the guinea pig model, the ED50 val-
ues  were  8.8  and  5.0  mg/kg/day,  respectively.  Similarly,  we 
determined  that  the  ED50s  of  ciprofloxacin  and  levofloxacin 
against  anthrax  using  rabbits  were  7.5  and  4.0  mg/kg/day, 
respectively.  The  ED50  values  for  levofloxacin  in  mice  in-
fected  with  Y.  pestis  and  F.  tularensis  were  0.7  and  0.1,  re-
spectively (Table 3). 

DISCUSSION 

  The  infectivity  profile  (Table  1)  of  the  three  bacterial 
pathogens revealed that F. tularensis SCHU S4 and Y. pestis 
CO92  had  lower  LD50âs  than  B.  anthracis  Ames,  when  the 
agents  were  administered  by  nasal  instillation.  In  related 
experiments  (in  mice),  the  virulence  of  all  three  select 
agents,  when  administered  by  subcutaneous  injection,  was 
essentially  the  same,  that  is,  approximately  5-6  cells/spores 
per animal (data not shown). With a low LD50 nasal instilla-
tion  dose  of  33  cells  in  BALB/c  mice,  F.  tularensis  barely 
exceeded the infectivity of Y. pestis, which was 100 cells. In 
Swiss-Webster mice, the LD50s of these two pathogens were 
about two logs lower than that of B. anthracis Ames spores. 
The LD50âs for B. anthracis Ames spores by nasal instillation 
in  guinea  pigs  and  rabbits  were  approximately  1  log  greater 
than  that  for  mice.  Importantly,  the  LD50  of  B.  anthracis 
Ames  spores  by  aerosolization  to  Dutch-belted  rabbits  was 
determined earlier to be 1 x 105 cfu, which was the same as 
the nasal instillation dose [4, 56].

Fig. (5). A. Survival of Swiss-Webster mice treated with various doses of levofloxacin for six days starting 24 h after challenge with 5 LD50 
of  Y.  pestis  C092  cells  by  nasal  instillation.  The  horizontal  bar  indicates  the  period  of  levofloxacin  treatment.  Complete  protection  against 
primary challenge was achieved by a dose of 5 mg/kg/day levofloxacin. Significance for all groups began at day 3, and while the two lowest 
doses were only significant for this time point, all other groups were significant until day 32. Significance from the control was determined 
by  the  Fisher  Exact  Test  (p<0.05).  B.  Survival  of  Swiss-Webster  mice  challenged  with  Y.  pestis  C092  followed  treatment  with  5  or  10 
mg/kg/day of Levofloxacin at various times post challenge. Animals were dosed for 6 days, once initiated, and survival was compared to the 
control  group  (no  levofloxacin).  Significance  (p<0.05)  for  all  treatment  groups  from  the  control  group  began  at  day  3.  Both  doses  of 
levofloxacin at 24 and 36 h postchallenge were significantly different (p<0.05) from the control group until the end of the study, but at 48 h 
both 5 and 10mg/kg groups were not significantly different from the control group (p>0.05). 

 
It  was  interesting  to  note  in  the  mouse  models  that  the 
ED50  for  levofloxacin  against  B.  anthracis  was  approxi-
mately 40-fold higher than the ED50 for Y. pestis (ED50=0.7). 
Similar  results  were  observed  with  levofloxacin  against  B. 
anthracis and F. tularensis in BALB/c mice (ED50=0.1). We 
suspect that the basis for these observed differences in ED50s 
is multifactorial and could be related to the number of bacte-
ria  constituting  the  challenge  dose  (5  LD50),  rather  than  to 
the  potency  of  levofloxacin  against  Gram-negative  versus 
Gram-positive  bacteria.  Alternatively,  the  resistance  of 
spores  to  antibiotics  and  chemicals  and/or  the  presence  of 
capsule  around  B.  anthracis  vegetative  cells  could  have  
affected the antibiotic dose or exposure needed to reduce the 

bacterial load. In fact, the MICs with levofloxacin and cipro-
floxacin  for  B.  anthracis  Ames  and  Y.  pestis  CO92  were 
each  determined  to  be  0.03 Î¼g/ml,  while  for  F.  tularensis  it 
was 0.03 Î¼g/ml with levofloxacin and 0.01 Î¼g/ml with cipro-
floxacin.  In  addition,  a  recent  study  examining  the  spore 
subpopulations  suggested  suppression  of  resistance  required 
greater  drug  exposure  with  more  frequent  antibiotic  dosing 
[57]. 

 
It  is  also  plausible  that,  differences  between  the  three 
organisms  with  respect  to  ED50/ED100  doses  of  the  two  
quinolones  may  be  illustrating  variations  in  the  immune  
response  related  to  the  various  virulence  factors  and  the

doses of  levofloxacin. The horizontal bar  indicates the period of  treatment (13 days). Significance from the  control was determined  by the 
Fisher Exact Test (p<0.05), and all of the groups of mice except for the 0.1 mg/kg/day dose of levofloxacin were significant. B. Survival of 
BALB/c mice challenged with F. tularensis SCHU S4 followed by treatment with 40 mg/kg/day starting at various times post challenge. The

mice, except for the one to which antibiotic treatment, was administered 120 h postinfection, were significant. 

known  immunomodulatory  properties  of  ciprofloxacin  and 
levofloxacin [42]. For example, the down-regulation of LPS-
mediated  proinflammatory  cytokine  production  associated 
with  fluoroquinolone  administration  may,  in  part,  explain 
why  lower  effective  doses  are  needed  for  infection  with  en-
dotoxin-producing  F.  tularensis  and  Y.  pestis,  as  compared 
to  infection  with  B.  anthracis.  Clearly,  further  study  of  the 
indirect  effect  of  fluoroquinolones  on  the  immune  response 
following  infection  with  these  pathogens  is  needed  to  ad-
dress this speculation.  

  Our  results  illustrated  that  levofloxacin  is  an  effective 
antibiotic in protecting experimental animals against all three 
bacterial  infections; however, the fluoroquinolones appeared 
more  potent  in  their  in  vivo  bactericidal  effect  against  

pneumonic  plague  and  tularemia,  than  against  inhalation 
anthrax.  

  The  serum  concentrations  and  pharmacokinetic  parame-
ters  of  ciprofloxacin  and  levofloxacin  were  nearly  identical 
in  the  guinea  pig  and  rabbit  models  despite  the  slightly 
higher  ED100  dosage  of  ciprofloxacin  required  to  obtain  the 
same  effectiveness  in  the  survival  studies.  Therefore,  with 
respect to these two models, there appears to be concordance 
between  ED50/ED100  doses,  fluoroquinolone  concentrations 
and  a  desirable  therapeutic  effect.  In  addition,  the  serum 
concentrations and the derived kinetic parameters are consis-
tent with the published literature [40, 47, 58, 59]. The noted 
limitation  of  these  concentration  data  is  the  fact  they  were 
obtained  in  uninfected  animals  and  involved  single-dose

administration.  The  approximate  Cmax/MIC  ratios  for  cipro-
floxacin and levofloxacin in guinea pigs and rabbits were 70 
and 40-80, respectively. The corresponding AUC/MIC ratios 
were  approximately  150-175  and  160-200.  These  values  are 
well  above  the  Cmax/MIC  ratio  of  19.6-33.8  (rhesus  mon-
keys)  and  AUC/MIC  ratio  of  15.8-30  (murine)  that  have 
been  associated  with  bacterial  eradication  and  clinical  out-
comes  reported  from  recent  pharmacodynamic  experiments 
specifically  involving  infection  with  B.  anthracis  [23,  37, 
40-41].  Deziel  et  al.  [37]  reported  AUC/MIC  ratios  of  ap-
proximately  200-300  were  needed  for  effective  therapy; 
however,  outcome  was  highly  dependent  on  the  animal 
model  used  and  frequency  of  dose  administration.  Finally, 
the  Cmax/MIC  and AUC/MIC ratios determined from data  in 
the  present  study  may  have  been  even  higher  in  infected 
animals  with  diminished  hepatic  and  renal  elimination  
receiving multiple-dose administration [58].  

  The extremely high 90 mg/kg dose of both ciprofloxacin 
and  levofloxacin  required  for  100%  efficacy  against  B.  an-
thracis in mice resulted in roughly dose-dependent increases 

in  Cmax  and  AUC  parameters.  These  values  correspond  to 
Cmax/MIC  and  AUC/MIC  ratios  of  800  to  nearly  1900. 
Therefore,  the  observed  differences  between  animal  species 
with  regard  to  B.  anthracis  infection  are  not  readily  ex-
plained on the basis of achievable serum concentrations rela-
tive  to  the  MIC;  however,  it  has  been  suggested  that  other 
pharmacodynamic  parameters  such  as  time  above  the  MIC 
(T>MIC)  may  be  an  important  determinant  of  outcome  for 
the  metabolically  inactive  spore  population  that  may  germi-
nate at antibiotic concentrations at or below the MIC [37, 40, 
57]. In addition, this disparity among models may be related 
to species-specific immune response interactions to the viru-
lence factors associated with B. anthracis.  

the 

recommended  dose 

  Regardless,  the  ED100  for  ciprofloxacin  in  rabbits  given 
by  the  i.m.  route  was  10  mg/kg/day  for  anthrax.  In  human 
adults, 
for  
inhalational  anthrax  by  the  oral  route  is  400-500  mg  
(5.7-7.1 mg/kg for an average 70 kg body weight) every 12 h 
for  60  days.  For  the  highest  oral  dose,  the  equivalent  in-
jectable  (i.v.)  dose  of  ciprofloxacin  is  400  mg  every  12  h 

for  ciprofloxacin 

44    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2010, Volume 4 

(http://www.globalrph.com/ciprofloxacin_dilution.htm.). 
Likewise,  the  recommended  levofloxacin  dose  for  adult  
human use is 500 mg/day (7.1 mg/kg/day), and the ED100 in 
rabbits  for  levofloxacin  is  7  mg/kg/day.  These  ED100  doses 
of  ciprofloxacin  and  levofloxacin  in  rabbits  seem  compara-
ble  to  human  doses;  however,  these  data  should  be  inter-
preted  very  cautiously  as  several  body  physiological  func-
tions  play  key  roles  in  determining  antibiotic  concentrations 
effective in a patient.  

 
In  mouse  and  guinea  pig  models,  it  was  clear  that  short-
term  therapy  with  either  ciprofloxacin  or  levofloxacin  was 
not capable of providing long term protection against B. an-
thracis,  since  cessation  of  antibiotic  treatment  resulted  in 
deaths  of  the  animals.  The  basis  for  this  observation  pre-
sumably is due to the inability of the antibiotic to kill all the 
spores.  However,  long-term  protection  from  antibiotics  in 
rabbits  appeared  superior.  Whether  this  could  be  related  to 
differences  in  spore  germination  in  rodents  versus  rabbits  is 
not  known.  Asynchronous  or  delayed  germination  is  be-
lieved to be an important problem in patients that has caused 
physicians to prescribe long-term courses of antibiotic treat-
ment  (e.g.,  60  days  or  longer).  This  medical  strategy  was 
based  upon  the  report  that  the  majority  of  nonhuman  pri-
mates, challenged with aerosols of B. anthracis spores, were 
protected against anthrax infection when treated for 60 days; 
however, superior protection was conferred by administering 
a  combination  of  ciprofloxacin  and  vaccination  with  protec-
tive  antigen  (PA)  [60].  It  is  also  possible  that  the  fluoroqui-
nolones  exert  differential  immunomodulatory  effects  on  the 
innate  immune  responses  of  rodents  versus  rabbits.  Indeed 
our  own  studies  have  also  indicated  a  synergistic  protective 
effect  in  mice  and  guinea  pigs  against  anthrax  when  cipro-
floxacin  was  combined  with  monoclonal  antibodies  against 
protective antigen (PA) of B. anthracis [4].  

  Despite the effectiveness of the fluoroquinolones in treat-
ing inhalation anthrax, as demonstrated in these animal mod-
els,  resistance  to  fluoroquinolones  is  emerging  among  other 
bacteria  that  cause  clinical  infections  [61-63].  It  is  also  im-
portant to consider the possibility of bacteria acquiring resis-
tance  to  a  particular  antibiotic  during  treatment.  Further, 
physicians  must  have  other  effective  antibiotics  to  prescribe 
in the event of a bioterrorism attack involving a B. anthracis 
strain  or  other  bacterial  threat  agents  carrying  multiple  anti-
biotic  resistance  factors.  This  scenario  is  of  particular  con-
cern because additional time is required to ascertain the anti-
biotic  susceptibility  profile  of  the  bacteria,  and  the  models 
indicate  that  prompt  initiation  of  appropriate  antibiotic  ther-
apy  postexposure  is  essential  to  prevent  a  lethal  infection 
with any of these select agents. 

  Treatment  with  levofloxacin,  is  also  very  effective 
against  plague  and  tularemia  and  a  6-13  day  treatment  24  h 
post  infection  resulted  in  100%  protection.  Therefore, 
levofloxacin  could  be  a  drug  of  choice  for  all  of  the  three 
category  A  select  bacterial  agents.  Recently,  antibiotic-
resistant strains of Y. pestis  emerged that were isolated from 
human  cases  of  bubonic  plague  in  Madagascar  [64,  65]. 
These  plague  isolates  with  natural  resistance  to  antibiotics 
contained  transmissible  plasmids;  in  one  case,  the  plasmid 
possessed  multi-drug  resistant  determinants  for  chloram-
phenicol  acetyltransferase,  streptomycin-modifying  enzyme 
and  TEM-1  beta-lactamase;  and  in  the  other  case,  the  plas-

Peterson et al. 

mid  encoded  high-level  resistance  to  streptomycin.  The 
bioweapon programs of the Former Soviet Union engineered 
drug-resistant  variants  of  highly  pathogenic  B.  anthracis 
strains specific for at least 10 different antibiotics (including 
the  fluoroquinolones)  [66].  Similarly,  spontaneous-resistant 
mutants  of B.  anthracis  Sterne  have  been  isolated  that  were 
resistant  to  18  different  antibiotics  [67].  The  same  could  be 
true for Y. pestis and F. tularensis. Therefore, studies should 
continue to develop new therapeutics  and antibiotics against 
these deadly pathogens, as currently there are no vaccines for 
plague  and  tularemia.  Further,  although  Biothrax  vaccine 
(Emergent  Biosolutions,  Gaithersburg,  MD)  is  available  for 
anthrax, it provides short-term protection and requires multi-
ple injections.
