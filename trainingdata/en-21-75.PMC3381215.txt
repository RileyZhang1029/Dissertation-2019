Capsaicin, the pungent ingredient in hot pepper, activates nociceptors to produce pain and inflammation. However, prolonged 
exposures of capsaicin will cause desensitization to nociceptive stimuli. Hyperpolarization-activated cation currents (Ih) contribute 
to the maintenance of the resting membrane potential and excitability of neurons. In the cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) 
neurons, we investigated mechanisms underlying capsaicin-mediated modulation of Ih using patch clamp recordings. Capsaicin 
(1 μM) inhibited Ih only in the capsaicin-sensitive neurons. Th  e capsaicin-induced inhibition of Ih was prevented by preexposing 
the TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepine (CPZ). Capsaicin-induced inhibition of Ih was dose dependent (IC50= 0.68 μM) and partially 
abolished by intracellular BAPTA and cyclosporin A, specifi c calcineurin inhibitor. In summary, the inhibitory eff ects of capsaicin 
on Ih are mediated by activation of TRPV1 and Ca2+-triggered cellular responses. Analgesic eff ects of capsaicin have been thought 
to be related to desensitization of nociceptive neurons due to depletion of pain-related substances. In addition, capsaicin-induced 
inhibition of Ih is likely to be important in understanding the analgesic mechanism of capsaicin.

INTRODUCTION

The hyperpolarization-activatedcurrent (Ih) is a cation current 
activated by membrane hyperpolarization. Th  e characteristics of 
Ih channels are: slow opening at negative potentials, permeability 
to both Na+ and K+ ions, and sensitivity to blockade with Cs+ 
ions.Activation of Ih at negative potentials can result in a slow 
depolarization,such a depolarizing influence could accelerate 
neuronal firing discharges. Because Ih has been thought to 
contribute to the maintenance of the resting membrane potential

[1], modulation of Ih can affect neuronal excitability. The ion 
channels underlying Ih have been discovered about a decade ago, 
these proteins were termed hyperpolarization-activated cyclic 
nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. In mammals, the HCN channel 
family comprises four distinct members (HCN1-4) [2]. HCN1 and 
HCN2 channels are largely expressed in the DRG neurons [3] that 
play an important role in the transmission of sensory information 
from periphery. Especially, Emeryet al. reported that HCN2 ion 
channels play a critical role in infl ammatory and neuropathic pain 
in mice [4]. Upregulation of Ih expression in the DRG neurons 
were related to the neuronal hyperexcitability in the neuropathic 
pain and pharmacological blockade of Ih could relieve the pain 
[5-8]. There have been many reports that suggest the inhibition 
of Ih may be the mechanism of opioid analgesics [3, 9] and local 
anesthetics [3, 5, 10-13]. Th  ese reports suggest that inhibition of Ih

may be responsible for the peripheral analgesia [9].
Capsaicin, the main pungent ingredient in chili peppers can 
excite nociceptive sensory neurons and produce transient pain in 
animals and humans. Capsaicin activates the transient receptor 
potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1), a nonselective cation 
channel with high Ca2+ permeability [14]. The TRPV1 channel 
is expressed in subsets of primary sensory neurons and nerve 
terminals and plays an essential role in detecting noxious heat 
and several other nociceptive stimuli. Based on the reports that 
TRPV1knockout mice exhibit reduced inflammatory thermal 
hyperalgesia, TRPV1 appears to be essential for mediating thermal 
hyperalgesia induced by inflammation [15, 16]. Paradoxically, 
prolonged or repetitive exposure to capsaicincan desensitize 
nociceptive sensory neurons and results in long lasting pain relief 
[17]. Ca2+-dependent desensitization of TRPV1 themselves likely 
contributes to the analgesic eff ects of capsaicin [18].
Neuronal excitability is due to the presence of voltage-sensitive 
ion channels in the plasma membrane [19]. Thus, activation or 
inhibition of these ion channels may contribute to the excitability 
of the sensory neurons and capsaicin analgesia. Capsaicin blocks 
voltage-gated Na+ channels in trigeminal ganglion [20] and DRG 
neurons [20-22], Ca2+ channels in the sensory neurons [23-25] 
and K+ channels in the trigeminal ganglion neurons [26]. Such 
inhibitions of voltage-sensitive channels by capsaicin may result in 
decrease oft he excitability of neurons and block the transmission 
of painful signal from peripheral tissues. 
As stated above, inhibition of Ih may be related to peripheral 
analgesia. Th  us, we hypothesized that inhibition of Ih in the DRG 
neurons may be one of the mechanisms underlying analgesic eff ect 
of capsaicin.Here, we studied the hypothesis that capsaicin could 
induce the inhibition of Ih in the cultured DRG neurons using 
patch clamp technique.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell culture
Primary cultures of DRG neurons dissected from all levels of 
lower cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord of two-day-old 
neonatal rats were prepared. Th  e dissected ganglia were collected 
in cold culture medium (4oC), which contained Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle medium/F-12 mixture (DMEM/F-12; Gibco, 
Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA), 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS; Gibco, Invitrogen), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 U/ml 
penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). 
Th  e collected ganglia were washed with the culture medium and 
incubated at 37oC for 30 min in 1 mg/ml collagenase (Type II; 
Worthington, Freehold, NJ, USA). Th  e ganglia were then washed 

three times with Mg2+- and Ca2+-free Hank’s balanced salt solution 
(HBSS; Gibco, Invitrogen) and incubated in 2.5 mg/ml trypsin 
(Gibco, Invitrogen) at 37oC for 30 min. Subsequently, the ganglia 
were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was 
washed two or three times with the culture medium to inhibit the 
enzyme. Th  e pellet in turn was suspended in the culture medium 
by gentle trituration with a Pasteur pipette, and the suspended cells 
were plated on square glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine 
(Sigma-Aldrich), which were placed in small Petri dishes. Th  en, 25 
ng/ml nerve growth factor (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) were 
added to each Petri dish. Cells were incubated at 37oC in a 95% air 
-5% CO2 gas mixture and used 1~3 days aft er plating.

Electrophysiology
Whole-cell membrane currents were recorded from the somata 
of DRG neurons. Electrodes were made by pulling borosilicate 
glass capillaries (Harvard, Kent, UK). Tip resistances were 2~3 
MΩ for whole-cell recordings. To record whole-cell current, 
cellmembrane was ruptured by gentle suction aft er the formation 
of a gigaohmseal. Capacitative transients were then cancelled. 
Whole-cell membrane currents were recorded at -60 mV using 
an Axopatch 200 Bamplifi er (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA, 
USA). Membrane currents were low pass filtered at 1 kHz and 
sampled at 2.5 kHz with a Digidata 1,322 data acquisition system 
(Molecular Devices). Data were analyzed using the pClamp 8.0 
software (Molecular Devices) and OriginPro 8.0 (OriginLab, 
Northampton, MA, USA). All electrophysiological experiments 
were performed at room temperature.

Solutions and chemicals
Normal Tyrode’s (NT) solution contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 3 
KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 2.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 (pH was adjusted 
to 7.4 with NaOH). The recording electrodes were filled with 
apipette solution containing (in mM) 135 K gluconate, 1 MgCl2, 
10 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.1 Na-GTPtitrated to pH 
7.4 with KOH. For intracellular Ca2+ chelation, 10 mM BAPTA 
was added to the internal solution. Th  e nominally Ca2+-free bath 
solution contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 
glucose, 1 MgCl2,10 EGTA (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). 
To isolate Ih from other voltage-sensitive currents, 0.5 mM BaCl2, 
0.1 μM tetrodotoxin, 10 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 
mM 4-aminopyridine and 0.1 mM NiCl2 were added to the bath 
solution throughout the experiments. Capsaicin was dissolved 
and stored as a 10 mM stock solution in 100% ethanol. All stock 
solutions were stored at  -20oC and were diluted with the bath 
solution to the desired final concentrations at the beginning of 
each experiment.

Capsaicin Inhibits Ih via TRPV1 Activation

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means±standard error of the mean (SEM). 
Inhibitory effects capsaicin were given as % inhibition=100×(1-
(Ih,cap/Ih,con)), where Ih,con and Ih,cap are the currents measured before 
and during application of capsaicin, respectively. All comparisons 
between means were tested for signifi cance using Student’s paired 
t-testand analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the post 
hoc Tukey test. p<0.05 was considered to indicate significant 
diff erence.

RESULTS

Eff ect of capsaicin on Ih
Hyperpolarization of DRG neurons voltage-clamped at -60 
mV induced noninactivatinginward current consisting of an 
instantaneous and a slowly-activating component (Fig. 1A). Ih 
was calculated as the difference between instantaneous current 
(Iinst) at the beginning and the steady state current (Iss) at the end 
of the 1s-voltage step, respectively. Capsaicin (1 μM) evoked in-
ward currents ranging from 0.69±0.15 nA at -60 mV in the DRG 
neurons.After applying capsaicin continuously for 1~3 min, the 
capsaicin-evoked currents were desensitized to a near steady 
state value 0.38±0.05 nA (n=17). At this time, to study the eff ect 
of capsaicin on Ih, hyperpolarizing voltage pulses were applied 
from -130 to - 60 mV with 10 mV increments in the presence of 
capsaicin. Amplitudes of Ih measured at -130 mV in the presence 
of capsaicin were significantly reduced by 92.5±14.2% (n=16). 
After washing these cells for another 3~5 min, Ih was partially 
recovered to their pre-capsaicin levels. Capsaicin blocked Ih 
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). IC50 was 0.68 μM and 
Hill coefficient was 1.13. The half-activation voltage (V1/2) 
was -94.1±2.3 mV in control and -109.9±3.1 mV in capsaicin 
treated cell, a negative shift  of about 15 mV (Fig. 1D). Inhibition 
magnitudes of Ih by capsaicin were not significantly different at 
various voltages (One-way ANOVA, F=1.57393, p=0.21659, n=19) 
(Fig. 1E).

Involvement of TRPV1 in Ih inhibition by capsaicin
We found that in capsaicin-insensitive cells where capsaicin did 
not evoke membrane currents, capsaicin had no signifi cant eff ect 
on the amplitudes of Ih (n=3) and activation kinetics (Fig. 2). To 
determine whether the effect of capsaicin on Ih is mediated by 
TRPV1 activation, we used TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepine. As 
shown in Fig. 3, capsazepine (10 μM )alone did not produce any 
eff ect on Ih. In the presence of capsazepine, 1 μM capsaicin failed 
to induce any inward currents as well as inhibitory effects on Ih. 
Th  ese results suggest that capsaicin indirectly inhibited Ih through

the activation of TRPV1.

Eff ect of Ca2+ on Ih inhibition by capsaicin
Because TRPV1 is highly permeable to Ca2+ [14], intracellular 
Ca2+ concentration can be greatly increased when the channel 
is opened. To determine the role of Ca2+ influx in the inhibitory 
eff ect of capsaicin on Ih, we removed extracellular Ca2+ from the 
bath solution. Amplitudes of Ih were not significantly changed 
by in Ca2+-free bath solution. Capsaicin inhibition of Ih was not 
abolished in Ca2+-free bath solution (Fig. 4). In the presence 
of intracellular BAPTA (10 mM), a rapid Ca2+ chelator, 1 μM 
capsaicin still inhibited Ih (n=6). However, the magnitude of Ih 
inhibition by capsaicin (62.1±10.2%) was significantly different 
from that obtained in pipette solution without BAPTA (n=6)

(Fig. 4A).Therefore, intracellular Ca2+ may be required for the 
inhibition of Ih by capsaicin in the DRG neurons. 
Rapid rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels may due to either Ca2+ 
influx or release of Ca2+ from an intracellular store. Thus, we 
investigated whether the inhibitory effect of capsaicin on Ih was 
mediated by Ca2+ released from the intracellular stores. To deplete 
intracellular Ca2+ stores, we pretreated DRG cells with thapsigargin 
(10 μM) and caff eine (10 mM) for 3 min and washed them out for 
at least 5 min, before applying capsaicin. Th  e percentile inhibition 
of Ih by capsaicin at -120 mV were reduced to 61.9±9.9% (n=7, 
p<0.05). Th  ese results demonstrated that increase in intracellular 
Ca2+ level is partially involved in the inhibition of Ih by capsaicin. 

Role of Calcineurin in Ih inhibition by capsaicin
Because the increase in intracellular Ca2+ appeared to be required 
for the inhibitory effect of capsaicin on Ih, we next determined 
if calmodulin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 
II are involved in this eff ect. Th  e specifi c calmodulin antagonist, 
W-7 or the selective Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 
II inhibitor, KN-93 was included in the pipette solution. In the 
presence of W-7 (10 μM), capsaicin still inhibited Ih (65.1±8.3%, 
n=5), which was not significantly different from the effect of 
capsaicin on Ih recorded using pipette solution without W-7 
(92.5±8.9%, n=17) (Fig. 5A). In the presence of KN-93 (10 μM), 
capsaicin still produced large inhibition on Ih (59.0±6.2%, n=9),

which was not signifi cantly diff erent from the eff ect of capsaicin 
on Ih recorded using control pipette solution (Fig. 5B). 
Ih can be inhibited by phosphorylation by PKC [27, 28], we 
determined whether PKC inhibitor can block the inhibitory eff ect 
of capsaicin on Ih. When 20 μM RO318210, PKC inhibitorwas 
included in the pipette solution, capsaicin decreased Ih by 
69.3±9.0% (n=21), which was not signifi cantly diff erent from the 
capsaicin-induced% inhibition obtained with normal pipette 
solution (Fig. 5C).
Calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) is a Ca2+-sensitive pro-
tein phosphatase and can be activated by a rise in intracellular 
Ca2+. To determine whether capsaicin inhibited Ih through 
dephosphorylationmediated by calcineurin, cyclosporin A, 
aspecific inhibitor of calcineurin was added to the pipette 
solution. As shown in Fig. 5D, subsequent application of capsaicin 
reduced Ih amplitude measured at -130 mV by 37.7±8.7% (n=8), 
a signifi cantly smaller reduction than the eff ect of capsaicin in the 
absence of cyclosporin A (p< 0.01).

DISCUSSION

In the present study, we demonstrate that capsaicin reversibly 
and voltage-independently inhibited hyperpolarization-activated 
cation current, Ih, in the culturedrat DRG neurons. We also found 
that capsaicin did not change Ih in the capsaicin-insensitive DRG 
neurons and TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepine eliminated the eff ect

of capsaicin on Ih. Th  erefore, capsaicin may indirectly modulate Ih 
via TRPV1 activation.
Because TRPV1, capsaicin receptor is highly permeable to Ca2+ 
[14], extracellular Ca2+ influx through the activated channel can 
influence on Ih. But, our findings that inhibition of Ih was not 
abolished by removal of Ca2+ from the bath solution revealed that 
extracellular Ca2+ influx and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) 
were not essential for the effect of capsaicin on Ih. We found 
that intracellular Ca2+ chelation and depletion of intracellular 
store partially abolished the inhibitory effect of capsaicin on Ih. 
It has been reported that functional TRPV1 was also expressed 
on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of DRG neuron [29, 
30] and capsaicin could increase intracellular Ca2+ level in the 
Ca2+-free condition [31]. Thus, it is likely that release of Ca2+ by 
the activation of TRPV1 in the endoplasmic reticulum could 
contribute to the inhibition of Ih by capsaicin to some extent.
As described in the result section, BAPTA, thapsigargin and 
cyclosporin A partly attenuated the inhibition of Ih by capsaicin. It 
is possible that additional mechanism underlies in the capsaicin-
induced Ih inhibition. Remaining portion of Ih inhibition by 
capsaicin may be caused by decrease in driving forces that move 
cations into the DRG neurons. When TRPV1 is activated by 
capsaicin, Na+ can enter rapidly into the neurons by concentration 

gradient and negative holding potential (-60 mV). It has been 
reported that activation of TRPV1 blocked voltage-gated Na+ 
channels as a result of increase in intracellular Na+ concentration.
Ih is a mixed cation current carried by both Na+ and K+ [2]. 
Therefore, movement of Na+ through the Ih channels might be 
inhibited by decreased Na+ concentration gradient due to increase 
of [Na+]i by TRPV1 activation. Therefore, amplitudes of Ih can 
be decreased by capsaicin as a result of decreased Na+ movement 
into the DRG neuronsthrough Ih channels in addition to Ca2+-
dependent modulation of Ih.
Increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration can trigger many 
intracellular events such as protein phosphorylation. Therefore, 
we were interested in the cellular events following the increase of 
intracellular Ca2+ level through activated TRPV1 in the modulation 
of Ih by capsaicin. Ca2+ can bindcalmodulin and desensitize 
TRPV1 [18]. If TRPV1 desensitization were responsible for the 
effect of capsaicin on Ih, inhibition of calmodulin could abolish 
the effect the capsaicin action. From the result thatcalmodulin 
antagonist, W7 failed to diminish the capsaicin- induced Ih 
inhibition, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent TRPV1 desensitization 
may not be responsible for the Ih inhibition. It has been reported 
that activation of PKC could inhibit Ih [27, 28], we tested the eff ect 
of PKC inhibitor in Ih inhibition by capsaicin. However, PKC was

not involved in the inhibition of Ih in our experiment condition. In 
the present study, we found that calcineurin (protein phosphatase 
2B) could play a role in down-regulation of Ih caused by TRPV1 
activation in the DRG neurons. Calcineurin is a Ca2+-dependent 
protein phosphatase and is responsible for the desensitization 
of TRPV1, either [32]. Since calmodulin antagonist failed to 
reverse the capsaicin effect on Ih, desensitization of TRPV1 may 
be irresponsible for thisinhibition of Ih.The target molecule of 
the dephosphorylarion by calcineurin may be not TRPV1 but Ih 
channel. From these results, we suggest that capsaicin may increase 
intracellular Ca2+ followed by modifi cation of the Ih channel.
It has been reported that Ih plays an important role in the control 
of electrical activity in various neuronal cells. Thus, suppression 
of Ih by capsaicin may cause depressant effects on neuronal 

activity and analgesia. Topical application of capsaicin has been 
used to treat neuropathic pain [33, 34]. It has been thought that 
capsaicin causes release of substance P from C fiber afferent 
neurons, and repeated application depletes stores of substance P 
and therefore reduces pain transmission from peripheral nerve 
fi bers to higher centers [35]. In addition to substance P depletion, 
inhibition of Ih may explain the analgesic eff ect of capsaicin. Our 
electrophysiological data can suggest the possible involvement 
of Ih inhibition in capsaicin-induced analgesia. Althoughrecent 
report that showed coexpression of TRPV1 and subtypes of HCNs 
in the sensory neurons [36] support this possibility, further animal 
studies will be needed to elucidate it.
