Biogenic amines (BA) in wine represent a toxicological risk for the health of the consumer,
with several trade implications. In this study 26 strains of Lactobacillus plantarum were ana-
lyzed for their ability to degrade BA commonly found during wine fermentation.Two strains
of L. plantarum were selected in reason of their ability to degrade putrescine and tyramine.
The degradation was assessed in vitro, both in presence of the BA and in presence of the
speciﬁc chemical precursor and of producer bacteria. The two L. plantarum biotypes were
found capable to work synergically. In addition, the survival in wine-like medium and the
aptitude to degrade malic acid after alcoholic fermentation of the selected L. plantarum
strains was analyzed. Our results suggest the potential application of wine L. plantarum
strains to design malolactic starter cultures able to degrade BA in wine.

INTRODUCTION
Biogenic amines (BA) are low molecular weight organic bases
with aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic structures commonly
found in ﬁsh, ﬁsh products, meat, dairy products, vegetables, wine,
cider, and beer (Suzzi and Gardini, 2003; Spano et al., 2010). In
general, foods likely to contain high levels of BA are fermented
foods or foodstuff exposed to microbial contamination during
food process or storage (Ali, 1996). Histamine, tyramine, cadaver-
ine, 2-phenylethylamine, spermine, spermidine, putrescine, trypt-
amine, and agmatine are considered to be the most important
BA occurring in foods. The main bacteria responsible for BA
production in fermented food matrices are the lactic acid bac-
teria (LAB; Lonvaud-Funel, 2001). In fact, LAB can catabolize
(principally decarboxylate) amino acids into amine-containing
compounds. The physiological role of BA synthesis mainly seems
to be related to defense mechanisms used by bacteria to withstand
acidic environments (Spano et al., 2010).

Indigenous BA compounds are also naturally produced in dif-
ferent human tissues because of their biological role in processes
such as synaptic transmission, blood pressure control, allergic
response, and cellular growth control (Russo et al., 2010). The
gastro-intestinal tract, as a function of dietary intake of food
containing BA, therefore represents an exogenous source of these
molecules for humans. This exogenous source of BA can provoke
high levels in the human organism, and in reason of their impor-
tance in physiological processes, with negative consequences to
human health (Ladero et al., 2010; Russo et al., 2010). Human
sensitivity ﬂuctuates according to the correct functioning of the
detoxiﬁcation systems since BA are generally metabolized in the
human gut through the action of amine oxidases (Spano et al.,

2010). Under physiological conditions this system has a protec-
tive role against the absorption of dietary BA. For this reason,
in individuals with a pathological deﬁciency of amine oxidases
activities, the ingestion of food products containing excess of BA
may lead to high levels of BA in the organism (Kuefner et al.,
2004). Additionally, the ethanol and some drugs have been found
to inhibit the detoxiﬁcation systems (Zimatkin and Anichtchik,
1999; Horton et al., 2005). In the wine industry, the occurrence
of BA has been receiving increasingly attention in reason of the
potential threats of toxicity to humans, connected with alcohol
content (Smit et al., 2008). There are trade implications due to the
recommended or suggested existing limits for histamine in wine
in some European countries such as Germany (2 mg/l), Holland
(3 mg/l), Finland (5 mg/l), Belgium (5–6 mg/l), France (8 mg/l),
Switzerland, and Austria (10 mg/l; Smit et al., 2008). In addition,
last year, the Panel on Biological Hazards of the European Food
Safety Authority release a Scientiﬁc Opinion on risk based control
of BA formation in fermented foods 9 [EFSA Panel on Biological
Hazards (BIOHAZ), 2011], testifying the attention of European
institutions to the subject.

In reason of the toxicity and of the existing legislative limits, sev-
eral technological strategies have been proposed in order to control
BA in foods (Naila et al., 2010). The main measure to prevent BA
formation is the microbial control through cold treatments. How-
ever, it is difﬁcult to operate with low temperature in the case of
fermented foods, where a microbial growth is crucial to obtain
the ﬁnal products. Secondary control measures to prevent BA for-
mation in foods or to reduce their levels once formed need to be
considered as alternatives. Methods to limit microbial growth may
include hydrostatic pressures, irradiation, controlled atmosphere

packaging, or the use of food additives (Naila et al., 2010). Fur-
thermore, BA could be controlled, especially in fermented foods,
modulating microbial resources. Indeed, fermented foods produc-
ers commonly utilize a speciﬁc starter culture, that is “a microbial
preparation of large numbers of cells of at least one microbial
species to be added to a raw material to produce a fermented food
by accelerating and steering its fermentation process” (Leroy and
De Vuyst, 2004). In general, the choice of starter cultures is cru-
cial to guarantee the quality of the ﬁnal products and microbial
starter unable to produce BA might dominates the autochthonous
microbiota, reducing the occurrence of BA producers (Dapkevi-
cius et al., 2000; Latorre-Moratalla et al., 2007; Naila et al., 2010;
Spano et al., 2010). Additionally, starter may control BA in food
via their amine oxidase activity because oxidizes BA into aldehyde,
hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia (Suzzi and Gardini, 2003; Naila
et al., 2010; Spano et al., 2010). In red wine, the most abundant
amines are usually putrescine, histamine, tyramine, and cadav-
erine (Beneduce et al., 2010), the last being considered the most
important reason for wine intolerance (Konakovsky et al., 2011).
Inoculation with starter cultures that are unable to produce BA is
a feasible option for the control of these chemical substances in
wine (Martín-Álvarez et al., 2005; Spano et al., 2010). However, it
does not represent the deﬁnitive solution when the dominance of
starter cultures on the indigenous BA-producer microﬂora is not
sufﬁcient. Recently, García-Ruiz et al. (2011) isolated some LAB
from wine and other oenological source and tested their ability to
degrade BA. Whereas a negative inﬂuence of the wine matrix was
observed, their ﬁndings indicated a potential application of wine
LAB in order to reduce BA in wine (García-Ruiz et al., 2011).

In this paper we report the selection of autochthonous strains
of Lactobacillus plantarum able to degrade BA and their suitability
to be used as malolactic starter in wine production.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
BACTERIAL STRAINS AND GROWTH CONDITIONS
The LAB strains included in this study were routinely cultured
on MRS (de Man-Rogosa–Sharp, Oxoid, Milan, Italy) medium.
The pH of the medium was adjusted to pH 5.8 with KOH before
sterilization for 15 min at 121˚C. Samples from 10 natural viniﬁ-
cations of “Nero di Troia” wines were aseptically collected at the
early stages of malolactic fermentation from winery located in
Apulia region (Italy). For microbiological analyses, 10 ml of each
sample were homogenized with 90 ml of a saline–peptone water,
after which serial dilutions were prepared. For the isolation of
LAB, MRS agar containing 100 mg/l of cycloheximide was used,
and the plates were incubated under anaerobic conditions (BBL,
GasPack-System) at 30˚C for 72 h. Isolates were identiﬁed as bacilli
and putative LAB by positive Gram staining and negative catalase
assay. All strains were stored at −80˚C in MRS supplemented with
glycerol (20% v/v).

STRAINS IDENTIFICATION
Genomic DNA of putative LAB was isolated using the Micro-
bial DNA extraction kit (Cabru, Milan, Italy) according to
manufacturer’s procedure.

Preliminary identiﬁcation of L. plantarum strains was per-
formed by ampliﬁcation of the recA gene. Primers planF and

pREV were used in the PCR tests (Torriani et al., 2001). For PCR
ampliﬁcation about 50 ng of genomic DNA were added to a 50 μl
PCR mixture and ampliﬁed with Taq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen,
Milan, Italy). The temperature proﬁle was as follows: 94˚C for
5 min; 30 cycles of 94˚C for 0.5 min, 46˚C for 0.5 min, 72˚C for
0.5 min; 72˚C for 5 min. Furthermore, the isolated strains were
identify by partially sequencing the 16S rRNA-encoding gene.
Most of the gene encoding the 16S ribosomal RNA was ampli-
ﬁed by PCR using primers pA and pH according to Edwards
et al. (1989). The amplicons were puriﬁed using QIAquick PCR
Puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) and sequenced. The result-
ing sequences were compared with sequences available at NCBI
database (GenBank) using the standard nucleotide–nucleotide
homology search basic local alignment search tool (BLAST;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST).

In order to verify if the bacteria analyzed in this study har-
bor genes encoding enzymes involved in production of BA such as
tyramine, histamine, and putrescine, a multiplex-PCR-based assay
was carried out to detect the presence of tyrosine decarboxylase
(tdc), histidine decarboxylase (hdc), and ornithine decarboxylase
(odc) genes (Coton et al., 2010). About 50 ng of genomic DNA
was added to a 50 μl PCR mixture and ampliﬁed with Taq DNA
Polymerase (Qiagen, Milan, Italy). The reaction mix was cycled
through the following temperature proﬁle: 94˚C for 5 min; 15
cycles of 94˚C for 1 min, 55˚C for 1.3 min, 72˚C for 1 min; 12
cycles of 94˚C for 1 min, 58˚C for 1.3 min, 72˚C for 1 min; 72˚C for
5 min.

PCR fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis

carried out by loading 10 μl of sample on 1.2% agarose gels.

ANALYSIS OF BA BY HPLC AND PRELIMINARY SCREENING
In order to test the individual degrading capacity of isolated
strains, BA concentration was quantiﬁed in MRS broth samples
supplemented with putrescine (1 mM), tyramine (1 mM), cadav-
erine (1 mM), or histamine (2.5 mM) after 24 h with or without
strain inoculation (2× 106 CFU ml
−1; total volume 20 ml). One
milliliter of each sample was centrifuged and the supernatant
was ﬁltered through 0.45 μm PTFE ﬁlters (VWR, USA). Five
microliters were derivatized using dansyl chloride, separated, and
analyzed using the conditions described by Ladero et al. (2011).

SURVIVAL IN WINE-LIKE MEDIUM AND MALOLACTIC FERMENTATION
The composition of the synthetic must and winemaking condi-
tions were based on the protocol described by Capozzi et al. (2010).
All components were purchased from Sigma, Milan, Italy. The syn-

thetic musts contained glucose (96.5 g l
−1), ammonium chlo-
dl-malic acid (10 g l
−1); pH was adjusted
ride (0.2 g l
to 3.5 with NaOH. The must was clariﬁed and sterilize by ﬁl-
tration through a 0.22 μm pore size ﬁlter (Millipore, Italy). The
must was inoculated at the concentration of 106 colony-forming
−1 with a commercial yeast culture (Saccharomyces
unit (CFU) ml
cerevisiae strain AWRI R2, Maurivin, Australia), and alcoholic fer-
mentation was performed at 22˚C for 22–30 days. Then, the wine
was clariﬁed by ﬁltration through a 0.22 μm pore size ﬁlter (Milli-
pore, Italy) to remove yeasts. After ﬁltration, the physico-chemical
properties of the wine-like medium were: 12.1% (v/v) ethanol,
4.9 g of l-malic acid per liter, pH 3.5. Wine was stored at 4˚C
until required for further experiments. MLF was initiated by direct
inoculation with L. plantarum strains grown at pH 3.5 for 16 h

50 ml of wine. A control without inoculation was performed to
verify any spontaneous MLF. Thereafter, the containers were incu-
bated at 18˚C. Bacterial numeration was performed by counting

RESULTS
IDENTIFICATION OF L. PLANTARUM WINE ISOLATES AND SELECTION
OF THOSE WITH ABILITY TO DEGRADE BA
Samples from 10 natural viniﬁcations of “Nero di Troia” wines
were collected in Apulian wineries. A total of 100 microbial isolates
were randomly recovered from the analyzed samples using MRS
agar containing cycloheximide in order to inhibit yeasts growth.
Following a preliminary Gram stain and catalase reaction, 63 iso-
lates considered as presumptive LAB (i.e., being Gram positive

and catalase negative) were selected. These strains were screened
by PCR with primers planF and pREV, using L. plantarum WCFS1
as positive control. The amplicon, of approximately 318 bp, was
present in both the DNA extracted from the positive control and
the DNA extracted from 26 of the 63 strains tested. 16S rDNA
sequence analysis conﬁrmed that all 26 isolated strains belong to
L. plantarum species.

Furthermore, the L. plantarum strains, named NDT with num-
bers from 01 to 26, were examined for their ability to degrade hist-
amine, tyramine, cadaverine, and putrescine, the main BA present
in wines. Of these, 30.8% were able to degrade putrescine, 26.9%
tyramine, 19.2% histamine, and 19.2% cadaverine. The ﬁve strains
demonstrating a percentage of BA degradation >5% are reported
in Table 1. These strains belong to ﬁve different viniﬁcations of
three diverse wineries. In reason of entity of degradation, L. plan-
tarum NDT 09 (22.12% of tyramine degraded) and L. plantarum
NDT 16 (31.09% of putrescine degraded) strains were selected as
good candidates for further characterization. The presence of the
main genes involved in BA production in these two strains was
also evaluated. However, none of the L. plantarum strains bacte-
ria analyzed harbor genes involved in BA production (data not
shown).

ABILITY OF L. PLANTARUM NDT 09 AND L. PLANTARUM NDT 16 TO
DEGRADE TYRAMINE AND PUTRESCINE IN CULTURE MEDIA
The ability of L. plantarum NDT 09 and L. plantarum NDT 16
to degrade tyramine and putrescine was analyzed in 1 l of cul-
ture medium, also in simultaneous inoculation (Figure 1). After
24 h of incubation, L. plantarum NDT 09, L. plantarum NDT 16,
and NTD 09-NTD 16 co-inoculation showed 22.58, 2.83, and
26.74% of tyramine degradation respectively (Figure 1). In the
case of putrescine the breakdown was 3.53% for L. plantarum
NDT 09, 31.43% for L. plantarum NDT 16, and 35.28% for the
simultaneous inoculation trial (Figure 1).

four hours after inoculation with degrader and producer strains,
tyramine and putrescine concentration were lowered to 29.62 and
38.17% respectively. Moreover, an increase capability to eliminate
the BA analyzed was noted when co-inoculation experiments (pro-
ducers vs. degraders) were performed. The increase degradation
of BA observed, could be due to the degradation activity of the L.
plantarum strains analyzed, but could also be attributable to inhi-
bition phenomena (for example by production of bacteriocins) of
the degrader on the producer strains.

SURVIVAL IN WINE-LIKE MEDIUM AND MALOLACTIC FERMENTATION
OF L. PLANTARUM NDT 09 AND L. PLANTARUM NDT 16
In order to analyze the survival and fermentation suitability of
L. plantarum strains able to degrade BA, the strains were inocu-
lated in a wine-like medium. The synthetic must was subjected to
fermentation by a commercial oenological yeast strain to achieve
12.1% v/v of ethanol content. In three independent experiments,
MLF was induced with L. plantarum strains NDT 09 and NDT
16 previously adapted at pH 3.5. The results obtained by the
quantiﬁcation of bacterial biomass and l-malic acid degradation
are reported in Figure 3. The sampling times were 0, 1 h, 1, 2,
3, 7, 14, and 21 days after strain inoculation. Neither degradation
of l-malic acid nor spontaneous growth was observed within the
control wine (uninoculated wine). The L. plantarum NDT 09 and
L. plantarum NDT 16 strains were able to survive in the wine-like
medium (Figure 3). An initial decrease in the survival with respect
of expected population (2× 106 CFU ml
−1) was noticed after the
inoculation in wine, probably due to the harsh conditions imposed
to bacterial cells. Bacterial population remained stable after 1 h.
Subsequently, LAB biomass concentration diminished progres-
sively up to the seventh day post inoculation (Figure 3). The strain
L. plantarum NDT 16 better survive in wine-like medium than L.
plantarum NDT 09 (Figure 3). At the 14th day after inoculation,
no viable cell was detected. Both strains were found able to degrade
l-malic acid. The efﬁcient consumption of this dicarboxylic acid
was conducted up to the 14th day after inoculation (Figure 3). L.

plantarum NDT 16 was found to better degrade l-malic acid than
L. plantarum NDT 09. After the 14th day, consistently to the ﬁnd-
ings in the survival, also l-malic acid degradation stopped. The
growth level and the l-malic acid consumption rates showed to be
strain-dependent. Overall, the results reported demonstrated that
the analyzed strains could be tested as malolactic strains for wine
with low l-malic acid contents.

DISCUSSION
The biotechnological approach reported in this paper, aimed to
conciliate malolactic fermentation and BA degradation within the
same biotechnological resources: the malolactic starter cultures.
The main species involved in malolactic fermentation in wine is
Oenococcus oeni. However, as reported by García-Ruiz et al. (2011),
in the wine environment, the highest potential for BA degradation
among LAB seem to be related to Lactobacillus and Pediococcus
species, while O. oeni demonstrated low and rare degradation char-
acteristics (García-Ruiz et al., 2011). In the last years, Lactobacillus
spp. received increasing attention as an important resource for
the design of a new generation of malolactic fermentation starter
cultures (du Toit et al., 2010), insomuch as we found in com-
merce malolactic starter formulate using L. plantarum V22 strain
released in 2010 by Lallemand (Cho et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2011).
Other than malic acid decarboxylation, the main advantages of L.
plantarum employed were: resistance to the stressing wine con-
ditions, production of wine aroma compounds, production of
plantaricins, all important factors to compete with spoilage LAB
(du Toit et al., 2010).

In this work, we selected two L. plantarum strains (named
NDT 09 and NDT 16) from a pool of L. plantarum strains iso-
lated from red wine undergoing malolactic fermentation able to
degrade BA such as putrescine and tyramine. The degradation
rates observed was higher than that previously reported for L.
plantarum strains (Leuschner et al., 1998; García-Ruiz et al., 2011).
Furthermore, the strains were evaluated in wine-like medium for

detected after 24 h of culture. Degradation activity is expressed as a

their suitability to degrade malic acid. Although MLF was incom-
pletely performed, the two biotypes showed a respectable aptitude
to degrade malic acid, indicating a possible application in reason
of wine/must malic acid content. As BA production ability was
found to be both species- and strain-dependent (Bover-Cid and
Holzapfel, 1999; Russo et al., 2010; Ladero et al., 2012), our work
conﬁrmed the scientiﬁc evidence indicating a species- and strain
dependence also in BA degradation by LAB. Our ﬁndings provided
the basis for an innovative approach that might be of particular
interest for hot climate regions where grapes are harvested at high
maturity usually resulting in wine with pH higher than pH 3.5,
high ethanol concentration, low malic acid content, and with con-
siderable spoilage-associated risks. Further studies are ongoing in
order to select new L. plantarum strains able to degrade histamine,
and to analyze the inﬂuence of wine conditions on BA degradation

and malic acid consumption by L. plantarum NDT 09 and L. plan-
tarum NDT 16. Indeed, as indicated by García-Ruiz et al. (2011),
wine chemicals such as ethanol (12%) and polyphenols (75 mg/l),
and additives like SO2 (30 mg/l) may reduce the degrading ability
of LAB strains.
