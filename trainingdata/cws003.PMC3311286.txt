the α1-6-mannosyltransferase

We recently presented a model for site-speciﬁc protein
N-glycosylation in Trypanosoma brucei whereby the
TbSTT3A oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) ﬁrst selectively
transfers biantennary Man5GlcNAc2 from the lipid-linked
oligosaccharide (LLO) donor Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol
to
N-glycosylation sequons
in acidic to neutral peptide
sequences and TbSTT3B selectively transfers triantennary
Man9GlcNAc2 to any remaining sequons. In this paper, we
investigate the speciﬁcities of the two OSTs for their pre-
ferred LLO donors by glycotyping the variant surface
glycoprotein (VSG)
synthesized by bloodstream-form
T. brucei TbALG12 null mutants. The TbALG12 gene
encodes
converts
Man7GlcNAc2-PP-Dol to Man8GlcNAc2-PP-Dol. The VSG
synthesized by the TbALG12 null mutant in the presence
and the absence of α-mannosidase inhibitors was charac-
terized by electrospray mass spectrometry both intact and
as pronase glycopetides. The results show that TbSTT3A
is able to transfer Man7GlcNAc2 as well as Man5GlcNAc2
to its preferred acidic glycosylation site at Asn263 and
that, in the absence of Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, TbSTT3B
transfers both Man7GlcNAc2 and Man5GlcNAc2 to the
remaining site at Asn428, albeit with low efﬁciency. These
data suggest
the preferences of TbSTT3A and
TbSTT3B for their LLO donors are based on the
c-branch of the Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide, such that
the presence of the c-branch prevents recognition and/or
transfer by TbSTT3A, whereas
the
c-branch enhances
transfer by
TbSTT3B.

Introduction
The African trypanosomes are tsetse ﬂy-transmitted protozoan
parasites. Two lifecycle stages are most amenable to laboratory
cultivation:
the procyclic form that normally grows in the
tsetse ﬂy midgut and the bloodstream form that causes African
sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. The procyc-
lic form of the parasite presents a coat that includes a set of
glycosylphosphatidylinositol
glycoproteins
known as procyclins, characterized by internal dipeptide (EP)
or pentapeptide (GPEET)
(Roditi et al. 1989;
Treumann et al. 1997), free GPI structures (Lillico et al. 2003;
Vassella et al. 2003; Nagamune et al. 2004; Roper et al. 2005)
and a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein complex (Guther
et
single
N-glycosylation site, occupied exclusively by a conventional
triantennary Man5GlcNAc2 oligomannose oligosaccharide at
the N-terminal side of the EP-repeat domain (Acosta-Serrano
et al. 1999). The bloodstream form of the parasite is covered
in a densely packed layer of 5 × 106 GPI-anchored variant
surface glycoprotein (VSG) dimers. This coat protects the
parasites
from the alternative pathway of complement-
mediated lysis, shields other cell surface proteins from the host
immune system and, by the process of antigenic variation,
allows the parasites to persist indeﬁnitely in the host blood-
stream (Cross 1996; Pays and Nolan 1998). The trypanosome
genome contains several hundred silent VSG genes, some of
which are pseudogenes, and antigenic variation involves the
switching of the expression of these genes, which encode im-
munologically distinct GPI-anchored glycoproteins with 1–3
N-glycosylation sites (Mehlert et al. 1998; Hutchinson et al.
2003; Marcello and Barry 2007). The bloodstream-form para-
site also expresses other less abundant GPI-anchored and/or
N-glycosylated glycoproteins that are arranged either randomly
in the VSG coat, like the invariant glycoproteins ISG65 and
ISG75 (Ziegelbauer and Overath 1992), or in speciﬁc surface
locations such as Fla1 which is localized to the ﬂagellar adhe-
sion zone (Nozaki et al. 1996) and the transferrin receptor
which is localized to the ﬂagellar pocket (Steverding et al.
1994). Other glycoproteins are located primarily in intracellu-
lar sites, like lysosomal p67 (Kelley et al. 1999), Golgi and
lysosomal tGLP1 (Lingnau et al. 1999), endoplasmic reticu-
lum (ER) GPIdeAc (Guther et al. 2003) and endosomal
TbMBAP1 (Engstler et al. 2005). Although the procyclic form
shares some of these glycoproteins, like p67, tGLP1 and Fla1,
others are bloodstream-form speciﬁc, such as ISG65, ISG75,
TbBMAP1 and the transferrin receptor.

Lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) donors for protein
N-glycosylation are assembled in the membrane of the ER.
Each of the sugars is added to the growing LLO by asparagine-
linked glycosylation (ALG) glycosyltransferases, which are
numbered according to the order of their discovery rather than
by the sequence of enzymatic steps (Burda and Aebi 1999).
Genomic and experimental comparisons have shown that some
lower eukaryotes do not possess all the ALG genes needed to
make the canonical mature Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol LLO
structure typical of most eukaryotes (Parodi 1993; Samuelson
et al. 2005). Trypanosoma brucei, for example, lacks the ALG8
and ALG10 glucosyltransferase genes (Jones et al. 2005;
Samuelson et al. 2005) such that Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol is

Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol intermediate is by far the most abun-
dant LLO in procyclic and bloodstream-form parasites (Low
et al. 1991; Acosta-Serrano et al. 2004; Manthri et al. 2008).
Uniquely, T. brucei uses both Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol and
Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol
to N-glycosylate its glycoproteins
(Jones et al. 2005; Manthri et al. 2008; Izquierdo, Schulz, et al.
2009) and this explains why endoglycosidase-H-resistant

The enzymes that transfer oligosaccharides from the LLOs
are called oligosaccharyltransferases (OSTs). These are typic-
ally multi-subunit integral membrane protein complexes that
mediates the en bloc transfer of the preassembled oligosac-
charide onto asparagine in glycosylation sequons (mostly
Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser; Xaa ≠ Pro) of nascent polypeptides entering
the lumen of the ER (Yan and Lennarz 2002, 2005; Kelleher
et al. 2003; Kelleher and Gilmore 2006). However, prokaryot-
ic (Lizak et al. 2011) and kinetoplastid OSTs consist of a
single-subunit homologous to the STT3 catalytic subunits of
OST complexes (Kelleher and Gilmore 2006). In the case
T. brucei, OST activity is catalyzed by two single-subunit
enzymes that
selectively transfer distinct oligosaccharide
donors to speciﬁc glycosylation sites (Jones et al. 2005;
Manthri et al. 2008; Izquierdo, Schulz, et al. 2009). Thus,
TbSTT3A ﬁrst
transfers biantennary Man5GlcNAc2 from
Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol
to glycosylation sites in acidic to
regions of polypeptides and TbSTT3B transfers
neutral
triantennary Man9GlcNAc2 from Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol
to
remaining glycosylation sites (Izquierdo, Schulz, et al. 2009).
The selective recruitment of triantennary Man9GlcNAc2 or
biantennary Man5GlcNAc2 to speciﬁc glycosylation sites in
this way is highly signiﬁcant because it predetermines the
kind of processing, and therefore the repertoire of ﬁnal glycan
structures, that can be generated at that site. Speciﬁcally, trian-
tennary Man9GlcNAc2 can only be processed as far as trian-
tennary Man5GlcNAc2 by T. brucei, which lacks a Golgi
α-mannosidase II gene, thus strictly limiting the glycoforms
at such sites to the oligomannose series. In contrast, biantenn-
ary Man5GlcNAc2 is the only route to paucimannose and
complex N-glycans in the parasite (Manthri et al. 2008), in-
cluding the novel giant poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures
found in bloodstream-form T. brucei
(Atrih et al. 2005).

Dol-P-Man:Man7GlcNAc2-PP-Dol -α1-6-mannosyltransferase.
In the cultured form of the normally insect-dwelling (procyc-
lic) life-cycle stage of the parasite, deletion of this gene
reduced the maximum LLO size from Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol
to Man7GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, as expected (Acosta-Serrano et al.
2004). The ALG12−/− cells proved to be resistant
to the
cytotoxic action of concanavalin A because they express
procyclins with altered N-glycans, predominantly shorter pau-
cimannose glycans (Man4GlcNAc2) with or without a termin-
al N-acetyllactosamine unit (Leal et al. 2004).

This paper describes the glycotyping of the VSG from
bloodstream-form ALG12−/− mutants. The variant 221 (also
known as MITat1.2) VSG coat glycoprotein is an excellent
reporter because it contains two N-glycosylation sites: one at
Asn263 occupied by small, biantennary paucimannose and
complex structures, which originate from the transfer of
Man5GlcNAc2 by TbSTT3A from the Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol
precursor, and one at Asn428 occupied by conventional
triantennary oligomannose structures, which originate from
the
TbSTT3B from
Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol
(Jones et al. 2005; Manthri et al.
2008;
Izquierdo, Schulz, et al. 2009). Thus, analysis of
VSG221 N-glycosylation allows us to simultaneously assess
the effects of genetic or chemical perturbations on both
mechanisms of protein N-glycosylation in this organism
(Jones et al. 2005; Urbaniak et al. 2006; Manthri et al. 2008;
Stokes et al. 2008; Izquierdo, Atrih, et al. 2009; Izquierdo,

Results
Analysis of intact soluble-form VSG221 synthesized by
TbALG12 null mutant cells
Wild-type and TbALG12−/− mutant cell lines were grown in
vitro, the latter in the presence and the absence of a cocktail
of α-mannosidase inhibitors (MI), and samples of 2 × 108
cells
from 100 mL of culture were processed to yield
(cid:1)100 μg of puriﬁed soluble-form VSG221 (sVSG221). sVSG
arises from the cleavage of diacylglycerol from the GPI
anchor by the action of an endogenous GPI-speciﬁc phospho-
lipase C (Cardoso de Almeida and Turner 1983; Cross 1984;
Ferguson et al. 1985). The sVSG221 synthesized by the
ALG12−/− parasites showed different glycosylation patterns to
that synthesized by wild-type cells, as judged by SDS–PAGE
(Figure 1, inset). Aliquots of the puriﬁed sVSGs were also
analyzed by positive-ion electrospray-mass
spectrometry
(ES-MS). The deconvolved mass spectrum of intact wild-type
sVSG221 (Figure 1A; Table I) showed the range of expected
glycoforms that arise from the known heterogeneity in the
GPI anchor and N-glycan sites (Zamze et al. 1991; Mehlert
et al. 1998; Jones et al. 2005; Manthri et al. 2008; Izquierdo,
Schulz, et al. 2009). In the case of sVSG221 synthesized by
the ALG12−/− mutant
the analysis
revealed a group of glycoforms centered around 49,293 Da

similar to the underglycosylated sVSG221 glycoforms found
in the TbALG3−/− mutant and in the UDP-GlcNAc pyropho-
sphorylase conditional null mutant under non-permissive con-
ditions,
i.e. with masses consistent with the C-terminal
Asn428 N-glycosylation site being unoccupied (Urbaniak
et al. 2006; Manthri et al. 2008; Stokes et al. 2008). The
higher molecular weight group of glycoforms, centered around
50,673 Da, with both N-glycosylation sites occupied, showed a
wider range of glycoforms than the wild-type proﬁle, including
glycoforms up to three hexose units smaller and some with sig-
niﬁcantly higher N-acetylhexosamine to hexose ratios than the
wild-type glycoforms (Table I). This suggests that the latter
group of glycoforms may be enriched in N-glycans with
LacNac structures at one or both sites. The effect of MI on the
ALG12−/− null mutant sVSG221 showed a general increase in
size for both groups of glycoforms, and the signiﬁcance of this
is described in the end of the results section.

Analysis of pronase glycopeptides from sVSG221
synthesized by TbALG12 null mutant cells
To further probe the nature of the changes in sVSG221 glyco-
sylation induced by the deletion of the ALG12 gene, aliquots
of wild-type and TbALG12 null mutant sVSG221 samples
(50 μg) were digested with pronase and the resulting glyco-
peptides were enriched and analyzed by ES-MS and ES-MS/
MS in a positive-ion mode (Manthri et al. 2008). As
expected, the data showed no changes in the masses of the
VSG GPI-peptide fragments in ALG12−/− cells or in these
same cells treated with MI (Figure 2; Supplementary data,
Table SI). However,
the presence of glycopeptides like
Hex4HexNAc4-NTT and Hex7HexNAc6-NTT are noteworthy
(at 1957.76 and 2688.12 Da, respectively), since they indicate
that,

Man7GlcNAc2 can be transferred to Asn428 comes from the
analysis of the pronase glycopeptides made from sVSG221

signiﬁcantly greater intensity in the ALG12−/− sVSG221 from
MI-treated cells, where the a-branch is protected from diges-

The molecular weights of different glycoforms of sVSG221 were calculated according to the indicated compositions. The −, traces, +, ++ and +++ scores
indicate the relative abundances of those glycoforms observed in sVSG preparations from the different cell lines, i.e. wild-type cells (WT), ALG12−/− null mutant
cells (ALG12−/−) and ALG12−/− null mutant cells growth with mannosidase inhibitors (ALG12−/− MI).
aProtein Mr is based on the amino acid sequence of the VSG221 precursor (accession no. P26332) minus residues 1–27 (signal peptide) and 460–476 (GPI
attachment signal peptide) and allows for four disulfide bonds (Mr = 46,284).
bComponents specific to the GPI anchor and common to all glycoforms; I-cP myo-inositol-1,2 cyclic phosphate; EtNP, ethanolamine phosphate.
cThe most abundant glycoform of wild-type sVSG221 is expected to contain a GPI anchor of composition of Man3Gal5, a C-terminal N-linked glycan of
Man9GlcNAc2 and an internal N-linked glycan of Man3GlcNAc2; i.e. HexNAc (GlcNAc) = 4 and Hex (Man + Gal) = 20.

TbALG12−/− cells (this paper) suggests that neither are the
preferred LLO donor for TbSTT3B, which appears to have a
strong preference for Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol. This,
in turn,
suggests that TbSTT3B requires the c-branch of the LLO
oligosaccharide for efﬁcient LLO recognition and/or transfer,
whereas TbSTT3A does not; indeed, its presence may impede
LLO recognition and/or transfer by TbSTT3A. This model of
LLO selection by TbSTT3s would be in agreement to the
mechanisms suggested for OSTs in other protists, such as
Trypanosoma cruzi, Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas
vaginalis (Kelleher et al. 2007). In these examples, a terminal
α1,2-linked mannose residue on the b- or c-branch of
Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol is a positive determinant for substrate

selection by the T. cruzi OST, whereas E. histolytica and
T. vaginalis OSTs select donors with a non-glucosylated
a-branch in the LLO but do not discriminate between
Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol and Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol (Kelleher
et al. 2007).

In summary,

the underlying mechanism for site-speciﬁc
N-glycosylation in T. brucei appears to be deﬁned by the se-
lectivity of TbSTT3B for LLO donors containing the c-branch
and of TbSTT3A for LLO donors lacking the c-branch,
coupled with the co-translational action of TbSTT3A and its
selectivity for sequons in relatively acidic environments and
the post-translational action of TbSTT3B with broad speciﬁ-
city for sequon environment (Izquierdo, Schulz, et al. 2009).

Fig. 2. Mass spectrometric analyses of pronase N-glycopeptides and GPI peptides. Aliquots of sVSG221 were digested with pronase and the glycopeptides were
puriﬁed and analyzed by ES-MS in the positive-ion mode. The ES-MS spectra were processed using the Bayesian peptide reconstruction program in the ABI
Analyst Software. The identities of the glycopeptides from wild-type (A), the ALG12−/− null mutant (B) and the ALG12−/− null mutant grown in presence of MI
(C) are indicated (see also Supplementary data, Table SI) and were conﬁrmed by MS/MS of the corresponding doubly charged ions (data not shown). GPI
glycopeptides (which do not change between the different cell lines) are labeled in italics.

Alternatively,
it could be argued that TbSTT3B absolutely
requires the complete Man9GlcNAc2 donor for activity and
that the partial glycosylation observed in Asn428 is catalyzed
entirely by TbSTT3A using either Man7GlcNAc2-PP-Dol or
Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, albeit inefﬁciently due to the absence
of an optimal acidic-neutral polypeptide region. However, this
latter model seems unlikely since it
in the
absence of TbSTT3B, TbSTT3A barely modiﬁes Asn428 at
all (Izquierdo, Schulz, et al. 2009) and, in contrast, there is a
signiﬁcant amount (>70%) of VSG with both N-glycosylation
sites occupied in the ALG12−/− mutant cells (Figure 1B). Our
results, therefore, support the notion that protists that cannot
synthesize the canonical Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol LLO,
such as T. cruzi and E. histolytica, have less stringent LLO
donor
synthesize
Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and mammals (Kelleher et al. 2007).

the T. brucei UDP-GlcNAc:glycoprotein GlcNAc transferase
type I (TbGnTI) and type II (TbGnTII) activities. These activ-
ities add βGlcNAc residues in 1-2-linkage to the 3- and
Manα1-3(Manα1-6)
6-arm,
Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc (Man3GlcNAc2) core and can
therefore be considered equivalent to the GnTI and GnTII ac-
tivities found in other eukaryotes. However,
the T. brucei
genome does not contain any obvious candidate genes for
these activities, although there are some 21 genes encoding
putative UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-Gal-dependent
glycosyltrans-
ferases of unknown function in the genome (Izquierdo,
Nakanishi, et al. 2009). Given the apparent sequence disparity
between general eukaryotic GnTI and GnTII enzymes and the
parasite equivalents, one might also expect speciﬁcity differ-
ences, and this does appear to be the case: ﬁrst, whereas
GnTI from higher eukaryotes acts on Manα1-3(R-Manα1-6)

the case for TbGnTII. Indeed,

The aforementioned peculiarities in protein N-glycosylation
and N-glycan processing in T. brucei have prompted us to
consider protein N-glycosylation as a potential
therapeutic
target against African trypanosomes. This is further supported
by the fact that both the TbSTT3A and TbSTT3B catalyzed
branches of N-glycosylation to paucimannose/complex and
oligomannose glycans, respectively, are essential for parasite
growth in animals (Izquierdo, Schulz, et al. 2009).

Materials and methods
Cultivation of trypanosomes
Bloodstream-form T. brucei genetically modiﬁed to express
T7 polymerase and the tetracycline repressor protein were cul-
tivated in HMI-9 medium containing 2.5 µg/mL of G418 at
37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator as described in Wirtz et al.
(1999). The ALG12 null mutant strain was a generous gift
from G. A. M. Cross lab (Leal et al. 2004).

Small-scale sVSG isolation
sVSG was isolated from 100 mL cultures containing (cid:1)2 × 108
bloodstream-form T. brucei. The cultures were chilled in ice-
water and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was
washed twice in trypanosome dilution buffer (Cross 1975)
and transferred to a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube. The pellet was
resuspended in 300 µL of lysis buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4
buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mM 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-
7-amino-2-heptanone, 1 µg/mL leupeptin and 1 µg/mL aproti-
nin) prewarmed to 37°C and incubated for 5 min at the same

temperature. The sample was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for
5 min, and the supernatant was applied to a 200-µL DE52 anion
exchange column pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. Fresh lysis
buffer (800 µL without protease inhibitors) was applied in four
stages, and the pooled column eluate was concentrated and dia-
ﬁltered with water on an YM-10 spin concentrator (Microcon,
millipore, Watford, UK). The ﬁnal sample of 50–100 µg of
sVSG221 was recovered in a volume of 100 µL water.

ES-MS analysis of intact VSG
Samples of the sVSG preparations were diluted to (cid:1)0.07
µg/µL in 50% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid, loaded into nano-
tips (Micromass-type F) and analyzed by positive-ion ES-MS
on a Q-Star XL instrument
(Applied Biosystems, Paisley,
UK). Data were collected and processed using the Bayesian
protein reconstruction algorithm of Analyst software.

ES-MS and ES-MS/MS analysis of pronase glycopeptides
Aliquots of sVSG ((cid:1)50 µg in 50 µL water) were mixed with
5 µL of 1 M ammonium bicarbonate and 10 µL of 1 mg/mL
pronase in 5 mM calcium acetate and incubated at 37°C for
36 h. The pronase glycopeptides were puriﬁed on Envicarb
graphitized carbon microcolumns, which were prepared as
follows:
the contents of an Envicarb cartridge (Supelco,
Poole, UK) were suspended in methanol and a bed of
(cid:1)20 µL of graphitized carbon was packed into a 100-µL C4
OMIX (Varian, Oxford, UK) pipette tip. The microcolumns
were prepared by attaching them to a Gilson pipette, set at
100 µL, and pipetting up and down 10 times with 80%
methanol, 1% formic acid; 60% methanol, 1% formic acid;
and 1% methanol, 1% formic acid. The sample (10 µL of
pronase digest) was mixed with 90 µL of 1% methanol, 1%
formic acid and applied to the microcolumn by pipetting up
and down 20 times. The microcolumns were washed by pipet-
ting up and down 20 times with 1% methanol, 1% formic
acid. The pipette was reset to 50 µL and the glycopeptides
eluted by pipetting up and down 20 times with 50 µL of 60%
methanol, 1% formic acid. Aliquots of these samples were
loaded into nanotips (Micromass-type F) and analyzed by
ES-MS and ES-MS/MS in the positive-ion mode on an ABI
Q-Star-XL instrument with tip and declustering potentials of
900 and 60 V,
ion spectra of
selected ions were collected using collision energies of 30–
60 V. The ES-MS spectra were processed using the Bayesian
peptide reconstruction program in the ABI Analyst software.
