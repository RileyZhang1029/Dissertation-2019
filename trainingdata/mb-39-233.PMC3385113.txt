Clubroot  symptoms  were  frequently  observed  on  roots  of  shepherd’s-purse  (Capsella  bursa-pastoris)  grown  in  a  field  in
Nonsan,  Chungnam  province,  Korea  in  March,  2009.  Many  resting  spores  were  found  in  the  cells  of  the  root  gall  tissues
collected  from  the  field.  The  clubroot  pathogen  was  identified  as  Plasmodiophora  brassicae  based  on  its  morphological  and
pathological  characteristics.  This  is  the  first  report  that  P.  brassicae  causes  clubroot  of  shepherd’s-purse  in  Korea.

Shepherd’s-purse  [Capsella  bursa-pastoris  (L.)  Medicus]
is a wild plant distributed globally. The plant is a popular
vegetable  in  Korea.  Clubroot  symptoms  were  frequently
observed on roots of the plant grown in a field in Nonsan,
Chungnam  province,  Korea  during  a  disease  survey
in  March,  2009.  There  was  no  distinct
performed 

difference  between  the  aerial  parts  of  healthy  plants  and
infected  plants  during  the  growing  period  (Fig.  1A).  The
symptoms  of  infected  plants  appeared  as  galls  on  the
roots,  whereas  healthy  plants  have  no  galls  (Fig.  1B  and
1C).  The  infected  plants  were  retarded  in  growth  and
slightly  wilted  at  the  late  stage  of  growth.  The  average

incidence  of  the  disease  symptoms  was  6.4%  in  the  field
investigated.

Root  galls  of  shepherd’s-purse  were  collected  from  the
field for examination and inoculation experiments. The root
galls were sectioned using a scalpel and observed by light
microscopy.  Many  resting  spores  were  found  in  the  cells
of the root gall tissues (Fig. 1D). The resting spores were
hyaline, spherical and measured 2.5~4.0 µm in diameter.

Root  galls  of  shepherd’s-purse  collected  were  used  for
inoculum  preparation  of  the  pathogen.  Suspension  of
resting  spores  was  prepared  from  each  of  the  collected
root  galls  [1].  The  suspension  was  adjusted 
to  a
concentration of 5~6 × 106 spores/mL using a hemocytometer.
The  20 mL  suspension  prepared  from  each  gall  was
inoculated  to  roots  of  young  shepherd’s-purse  plants
grown in circular plastic pots (29 cm in height and 21 cm
in diameter) in a greenhouse at 18~28oC. The same quantity
of  sterile  distilled  water  was  used  as  the  control.  Disease
ratings  were  made  based  on  the  degree  of  gall  formation
on the roots 50 days after inoculation. The inoculation test
was performed in three independent replicates.

Each of three resting spore suspensions caused clubroot
symptoms  on  the  roots,  which  were  similar  to  those
observed  during  the  field  survey.  Resting  spores  of  the
pathogen  were  observed  in  the  cells  of  the  affected  roots.
The  clubroot  pathogen  was  identified  as  Plasmodiophora
brassicae  Woronin  based  on 
its  morphological  and
pathological  characteristics,  which  were  consistent  with
those described by Buczacki [2].

P.  brassicae  causes  clubroot  of  crucifers  [2, 3].  The
disease has been a major problem in areas where Chinese
cabbage  and  some  other  cruciferous  crops  are  cultivated
in  Korea  [1, 4].  Shepherd’s-purse  is  a  cruciferous  wild
plant  and  cultivated  rarely  as  a  vegetable  in  the  country.
There was a record on the disease occurrence of the plant
in  the  United  States  [5].  This  is  the  first  report  that  P.

brassicae causes clubroot of shepherd’s-purse in Korea.

Various physiologic races based on the pathogenicity of
P.  brassicae  isolates  have  been  reported  attacking  crucifers
[6, 7].  Further  study  is  needed  to  identify  races  of  the
pathogen isolates from shepherd’s-purse.
