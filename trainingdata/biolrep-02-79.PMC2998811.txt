Abstract
The ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) regulates the turnover of improperly folded and damaged
proteins to maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis), cellular function, and viability. It is commonly
thought that an age-related impairment of the UPS affects general proteostasis networks, which
causes enhanced protein aggregation and contributes to normal aging. Recent studies identified the
existence of ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathways that specifically control lifespan regulators,
suggesting additional roles for ubiquitylation in aging and longevity.

Introduction and context
Protein ubiquitylation is a key control mechanism
contributing to diverse cellular processes, such as protein
quality control, cell-cycle progression, signal transduc-
tion, and development [1]. Substrates of the ubiquitin/
proteasome system (UPS) get post-translationally mod-
ified by covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin
molecules at internal lysine residues. This polyubiquity-
lation of substrate proteins is mediated by an enzymatic
cascade that involves ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1),
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin
protein ligases (E3). A chain made of
four to six
ubiquitin moieties targets the conjugated substrate for
degradation by the 26S proteasome [2,3]. The 26S
proteasome is a multi-catalytic protease complex com-
posed of one proteolytically active 20S proteasome and
two 19S regulatory particles, each attached to one end of
the 20S proteasome. A single 19S regulatory particle can
be divided into ‘base’ and ‘lid’ subcomplexes [4].
Independent observations in different organisms
showed an age-related reduction of the 26S proteasome
activity associated with increased protein aggregation
and proteotoxicity [5]. Consequently, proteasomal
impairment
the key
determinants of the aging process.

is commonly seen as one of

Work over the past decade identified genetic programs
regulating aging and longevity [6]. The most extensively
studied pathways of those are the insulin/insulin-like
growth factor 1 signaling (IIS) pathway and the dietary
restriction (DR) pathway. The central regulator of the
conserved IIS pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans, called
DAF-2, is important for lifespan, stress response, and
metabolism. Loss of DAF-2 signaling activates the down-
stream Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor
DAF-16, which modulates gene expression to extend
lifespan. The DR pathway describes the regulation of aging
by nutrient uptake, as it has been shown that lifespan can
be extended when diet is restricted in a number of species
ranging from yeast to mammals. In C. elegans, key factors
of DR-dependent lifespan extension include the transcrip-
tion factors PHA-4 and SKN-1. DR causes activation of
SKN-1 in two sensory ASI neurons, which results in
increased metabolic activity of peripheral tissues [7]. In
addition to its role in DR, SKN-1 is important for oxidative
stress resistance and induces genes involved in detoxifica-
tion and protein homeostasis (proteostasis).

Major recent advances
As mentioned before, impairment of the 26S proteasome
is beginning to be recognized as a key determinant for

normal aging; however, mechanistic aspects causing the
age-related decline of proteasomal activity are not clear.
An exciting study using Drosophila melanogaster demon-
strated for the first time that reduction of proteasomal
activity results from the attenuation of both the activity
and amount of the 26S proteasome during aging due to
its impaired assembly [8]. Intriguingly, overexpression
of lid subunits of the 19S regulatory particle, such as
Rpn11, suppresses the age-related impairment of pro-
teasomal function, which might reflect enhanced assem-
bly of the 26S proteasome. In line with these data, recent
reports showed that C. elegans lacking proteasomal
subunits or AIP-1 (ASK-interacting protein 1, a regulator
that is important for proteasomal adaptation to proteo-
toxic stress conditions) exhibit a shortened lifespan
[9,10]. Together, these results suggest that maintenance
of the 26S proteasome integrity during aging could
suppress proteotoxicity and aggregate formation and
thus promote longevity. The comparison between
ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in neurons and muscle
cells detected that the UPS is differently rather than
equally impaired by aging in individual cell types [11],
which might underlie the enhanced susceptibility of
certain tissues for age-related protein aggregation.

Besides the observation of an overall decline of UPS
activity with age affecting proteostasis, different ubiqui-
tin ligases have been identified to regulate longevity by
specifically targeting central
lifespan modulators for
proteasomal degradation. Two E3 ubiquitin ligases
were shown to regulate the activity of
the FOXO
transcription factor DAF-16, which is important for IIS
in different ways. Whereas the E3 ligase RLE-1 limits
longevity by direct turnover of DAF-16 [12], a cullin 1
(CUL-1)-based E3 ligase complex promotes extended
lifespan by ubiquitylation of yet unidentified DAF-16
inhibitors [9]. In addition to ubiquitin-mediated IIS
regulation, several E3 enzymes are required for the
lifespan extending effects of DR in C. elegans. The
transcription factor SKN-1 was shown to be targeted by
the substrate recognition subunit WDR-23 to the CUL-4-
based E3 ligase complex [13]; however, the substrate of
the E3 ligase WWP-1 important for DR is not yet known
[14]. Interestingly, a new role for the hypoxic response is
both promoting and limiting longevity dependent on
the context,
indicating complex regulatory signalling
mechanisms. Central to this pathway is the degradation
of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 by
the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor VHL-1.
Worms lacking HIF-1 at elevated temperatures exhibit
an increased lifespan, which is based on DR effects [15].
In contrast, at lower temperatures, lifespan elongation
results from enhanced expression or stabilization of
HIF-1, independent of DR or IIS [16].

Future directions
Besides the requirement of proteasomal integrity for
normal lifespan, the identification of degradation path-
ways specifically regulating central lifespan modulators
reflects the importance of the UPS for the aging process.
The elevation of SKN-1 levels upon proteasomal
dysfunction [17] together with its role in proteasomal
gene expression [18] suggest a close interplay between
specific and general degradation pathways in lifespan
regulation. Thus, the identification of metabolic and
stress-induced signals will offer
intriguingly new
mechanistic insights into the regulation of aging and
longevity governed by ubiquitin.
