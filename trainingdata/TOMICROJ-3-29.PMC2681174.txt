Abstract: The Escherichia coli ClpYQ (HslUV) complex is an ATP-dependent protease, and the clpQ+Y+ (hslV+U+) ope-
ron  encodes  two  heat  shock  proteins,  ClpQ  and  ClpY,  respectively.  The  transcriptional  (op)  or  translational  (pr) 
clpQ+::lacZ fusion gene was constructed, with the clpQ+Y+ promoter fused to a lacZ reporter gene. The clpQ+::lacZ (op 
or pr) fusion gene was each crossed into lambda phage. The (cid:2)clpQ+::lacZ+ (op), a transcriptional fusion gene, was used to 
form  lysogens  in  the  wild-type,  rpoH  or/and  rpoS  mutants.  Upon  shifting  the  temperature  up  from  30  oC  to  42  oC,  the 
wild-type  (cid:2)clpQ+::lacZ+  (op)  demonstrates  an  increased  (cid:1)-galactosidase  ((cid:1)Gal)  activity.  However,  the  (cid:1)Gal  activity  of 
clpQ+::lacZ+  (op)  was  decreased  in  the  rpoH  and  rpoH  rpoS  mutants  but  not  in  the  rpoS  mutant.  The  levels  of 
clpQ+::lacZ+ mRNA transcripts correlated well to their (cid:1)Gal activity. Similarly, the expression of the clpQ+::lacZ+ gene 
fusion  was  nearly  identical  to  the  clpQ+Y+  transcript  under  the  in  vivo  condition.  The  clpQm1::lacZ+,  containing  a  point 
mutation  in  the  -10  promoter  region  for  RpoH  binding,  showed  decreased  (cid:1)Gal  activity,  independent  of  activation  by 
RpoH. We conclude that RpoH itself regulates clpQ+Y+ gene expression. In addition, the clpQ+Y+ message carries a con-
served 71 bp at the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) that is predicted to form the stem-loop structure by analysis of its RNA 
secondary structure. The clpQm2
(cid:1)40::lacZ+, with a 40 bp deletion in the 5’UTR, showed a decreased (cid:1)Gal activity. In ad-
dition, from our results, it is suggested that this stem-loop structure is necessary for the stability of the clpQ+Y+ message.  

Key  Words:  Promoter  activity,  Gene  regulation,  E.  coli,  ClpYQ  (HslUV),  ATP-dependent  protease,  5’  stem-loop  structure, 
mRNA stability.  

INTRODUCTION 

The E. coli clpQ+Y+ operon, encoding an ATP-dependent 
protease, was originally discovered as part of the heat shock 
apparatus  [1].  In  the  clpQ+Y+  operon,  the  first  gene,  clpQ+, 
encodes  a  small  peptidase  of  19  KDa,  and  the  second  gene, 
clpY+, encodes an ATPase large subunit of 50 KDa [1-3]. In 
the  presence  of  ATP,  the  ClpYQ  complex  forms  an  active 
protease  with  an  Y6Q6Q6Y6  configuration  [2,  3].  Biochemi-
cal  and  genetic  analyses  have  shown  that  the  cellular  pro-
teins,  SulA,  RcsA,  and  RpoH  are  degraded  by  the  ClpYQ 
protease  [4-11],  and  that  ClpY  interacts  with  SulA  in  the 
yeast  two-hybrid  assays  [12].  It  was  recently  reported  that 
Cpx-mediated  TraJ  degradation  by  ClpYQ  is  a  stress-
mediated  response  [13].  The  most  recent  aspects  for  the 
study of the biological activity of the ClpYQ ATP-dependent 
protease is reviewed in Wu et al., 2008 [14].  

 Heat  shock  responses  are  typically  observed  in  E.  coli 
(reviewed  in  [15-17]).  Upon  heat  shock,  protein  misfolding 
leads  to  a  cascade  of  intracellular  protein  synthesis,  usually 
32,  for  their  gene  expres-
dependent  on  a  sigma  factor,  i.e.,  (cid:1)
32  consensus  binding  sequences  are  found  in  the 
sion.  The  (cid:1)
upstream  region  of  the  clpQ+Y+  operon  and  its  mRNA  pro-
duction is increased upon heat shock induction (Fig. 1A) [1]. 
However, no empirical experiment was performed to directly

identify that the RpoH ((cid:1)
induction  of  clpQ+Y+.  In  addition,  the  transcriptional  start 
point  of  the  clpQ+Y+  gene  lies  71  bases  upstream  from  the 
clpQ+  start  codon  (Fig.  1A).  An  untranslated  region  (UTR) 
upstream of this mRNA contains a 20 bp inverted repeat (IR) 
sequence  5’CCCCGTACTTTTGTACGGGG3’,  which 
is 
unique  for  the  clpQ+Y+  operon  (Fig.  1A).  In  addition,  from 
the wild bacterial genome, the 5’UTR of clpQ+Y+ also exists 
in other bacterial species (Fig. 1B).  

In this study, we analyzed clpQ+Y+ mRNA production in 
wild-type  (wt)  cells  versus  sigma-factor  deficient  mutants 
using a (cid:2)clpQ+::lacZ+ fusion gene, in which a chromosomal 
clpQ+Y+ promoter is fused with a lacZ+ reporter. We demon-
strated  that  the  expression  of  the  lacZ  reporter  gene  is  in-
duced  in  the  wild-type  cells  but  not  in  rpoH-deficient  mu-
tants  under  the  heat  shock  induction.  The  clpQm1::lacZ+  fu-
sion  gene,  carrying  a  C  to  T  mutation  in  the  -10  promoter 
site for RpoH-binding, showed a decreased gene  expression. 
No additional sigma factor was identified for an activation of 
its  gene  expression.  Thus,  through  a  genetic  analysis,  the 
32. In addition, a 
clpQ+Y+ promoter is in vivo recognized by (cid:1)
stem-loop structure (IR) at the 5’ end of the UTR of clpQ+Y+ 
mRNA  is  shown  to  be  necessary  for  clpQ+Y+  gene  expres-
sion.

ces from the 5’UTR of the clpQ+Y+ genes were aligned among the different bacterial species. The bacteria are present mainly in the Entero-
bacteriaceae family, i.e. Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica subsp. Enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter sp., 
Serratia proteamaculans, Yersinia pestis, Erwinia tasmaniensis and Citrobacter koseri. The sequence that forms a hairpin structure is under-
lined and the IR sequence is highlighted. The Shine-Darlgarno sequence is boxed and the translational start site is in bold.  

and the bacteria were grown in LB broth, with an addition of 
the  appropriate  antibiotics  as  required.  Supplements  were 
added  as  the  following  final  concentrations  when  needed: 
100  μg  ampicillin  (Ap)  ml-1;  40  mg  X-gal  ml-1.  The  Taq 
DNA  polymerase,  restriction  endonucleases,  and  other  en-
zymes  were  obtained  from  Takara,  New  England  BioLabs 
and Biolab (Taipei). Chemicals were obtained from Sigma or 
Wako. 

P1 Transduction and Other General Methods 

P1vir,  (cid:1) derivative  phages,  and  transduction  were  pre-
pared as described by Silhavy et al. [23]. Mutant strains were 
constructed  by  P1  transduction  by  procedures  as  described 
by Miller [24]. For plasmid constructions, E. coli XL-1 blue 
competent  cells  were  used.  Plasmid  transformations  were 
performed as described by Chung et al. [25]. Plasmid purifi-
cation was performed according to the instructions of manu-
facturers (Viogene).

lacZ’, in pRS414] were constructed as follows. The plasmid, 
pWPC80 [9], was used as  a template for an amplification of 
a promoter region of clpQ+Y+. The PCR was used to amplify 
the  genes  surrounding  the  upstream  region,  including  the 
clpQ+Y+
 promoter, the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) site, and the first  
thirteen  amino  acids  of  clpQ+,  and  the  resulting  DNA  frag-
ment  was fused in-frame  to lacZ’  in pRS414 [22], a transla-
tional  lacZ’  fusion  (pr)  plasmid  [22];  this  upstream  region 
was also cloned separately in front of lacZ+ in pRS415 plas-
mid  with  a  transcriptional  lacZ+  fusion  (op).  Two  sets  of 
primers were used. Set 1: F1 and R1. Set 2: F2, R1. The PCR 

conditions  were  performed  according  to  the  manufacturer’s 
instructions,  and  then  the  PCR  products  were  purified  with 
Viogene  Gel-M  kits.  Both  pRS414  and  pRS415  plasmids 
were  cut  with EcoRI  and  BamHI  and  ligated  with  the  DNA 
fragments  treated  with  the  same  restriction  enzymes.  The 
resulting  ligated  mixtures  were  then  transformed  into  the  
E. coli XL-1 blue, and the transformants were selected on am-
picillin  agar  plates.  Plasmids  isolated  from  colonies  grown 
on  the  selective  media  were  subjected  to  restriction  enzyme 
analysis,  followed  by  DNA  sequencing.  To  construct 
clpQm1::lacZ+,  with  a  C  to  T  mutation,  a  set  of  primers  was

used as follows: F3 and R1. Similar procedures as described 
above were used to clone the PCR fragment carrying clpQm1 
upstream  of  lacZ.  Two  resulting  plasmids,  clpQm1::lacZ+  
in  pRS415  and  clpQm1::  lacZ’  in  pRS414,  were  designated 
pSY5  and  pSY6,  respectively.  Several  PCR  steps  were  then 
used to construct a clpQm2
(cid:1)40:: lacZ+, with a 40 bp deletion 
in  the  internal  region  of  UTR  upstream  of  the  fusion  gene. 
To  construct  a  clpQm2
(cid:1)40  mutation,  a  two-step  PCR  was 
used  to  amplify  the clpQ+  promoter  and  its  adjacent  region. 
The  upstream  region  primers  were  F2  and  R2.  The  down-
stream  primers  were  F4  and  R3.  Two  overlapping  PCR 
fragments were then used as the template and were amplified 
by  the  primers  of  F2  and  R3.  The  resulting  DNA  fragment 
with a 40 bp deletion within the  leader sequences (as shown 
in  Fig.  1A)  was  cloned  into  pRS415  and  pRS414  at  EcoRI-
BamHI  sites,  and  the  resulting  plasmids  were  designated 
pRS415-clpQm2
(cid:1)40:: 
lacZ’ (pSY8), respectively.  

(cid:1)40::lacZ+ (pSY7) and pRS414-clpQm2

Plasmids  pBAD33-clpQ+  (pSY9),  pBAD33-(cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+ 
(pSY10)  and  pBAD33-(cid:1)L-clpQ+  (pSY11)  were  constructed 
as described below. Using the pWF1 [9] as the template, the 
various  DNA  fragments  surrounding  the  upstream  region  of 
clpQ+  gene  and  the  upstream  region  alone  were  separately 
PCR-amplified.  The  resulting  DNA  fragments  were  cloned 

in series into the pBAD33  at the KpnI-HindIII sites, and the 
cloned  genes  were  all  under  the  pBAD  promoter  control. 
Consequently,  the  plasmid  pBAD33-clpQ+carries  the  up-
stream  71  nucleotides  from  the  translational  start  site  of 
clpQ+  and  clpQ+  itself.  The  F5  and  R4  primers  were  used. 
The plasmid pBAD33-(cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+, which contains 35 nucleo-
tides  upstream  of  the  GTG  initiative  codon  of  clpQ+  and 
clpQ+  itself  under  the  pBAD  promoter,  was  constructed,  us-
ing  F6  and  R4  primers  to  amplify  a  DNA  fragment  of (cid:1)(cid:2)R-
clpQ+.  The  plasmid  pBAD33-(cid:1)L-clpQ+  was  constructed,  in 
which  the  15  nucleotides  upstream  of  the  first  GTG  codon 
and  clpQ+ itself  were  under  the  pBAD  promoter  control.  To 
generate (cid:1)L-clpQ+,  F7  and  R4  primers  were  used.  In  addi-
tion,  the  plasmid  pBAD33-(S-IR)-clpQ+  (pSY12)  was  con-
structed,  which  carries  the  substituted  T  sequences  at  the  5’ 
end  of  the  UTR  of clpQ+  (indicated  with  bold  in  the  primer 
F8), using the F8 and  R4 primers. Plasmid pBAD33-(R-IR)-
clpQ+  (pSY13)  carries  the  substituted  nucleotides  at  the  5’ 
end of UTR of clpQ+, resulting in a newly introduced secon-
dary  structure.  The  F9  and  the  R4  primers  were  used  for 
generating  the  DNA  fragment  of (R-IR)-clpQ+.  The  plasmid 
pBAD24-clpY+  (pSY14)  was  constructed  as  follows.  Using 
the  pWF1  as  the  template,  the clpY+  was  amplified,  and  the 
resulting DNA fragment was  cloned into the pBAD24 at the

EcoRI-HindIII  cutting  sites  [10,  26].  All  the  constructed 
plasmids  with  the  correct  DNA  insert  were  identified  by  re-
striction enzyme mapping as well by DNA sequencing. 

Construction of (cid:3)clpQ::lacZ Fusion Gene 

Plasmids pSY1 (clpQ+:: lacZ+, op-141), pSY2 (clpQ+::lacZ’, 
pr-141), pSY3 (clpQ+:: lacZ+, op-478) and pSY4 (clpQ+::lacZ’, 
pr-478)  were  made.  These  four  plasmids  were  transformed 
into  the  E.  coli  XL-1  blue,  and  the  resultant  transformants 
(Apr)  were  selected  on  ampicillin  plates.  The  transformant 
cells  were  then  infected  with  the  lambda  derivative  (cid:3)RS45 
and  selected  for  blue  plaques  on  X-gal  plates  leading  to 
clpQ+::lacZ+  transcriptional  or  clpQ+::’lacZ  translational 
fusion  genes  transferred  into  (cid:3)RS45(cid:1)  [22].  The  derivative 
(cid:3)RS45(cid:1)clpQ::lacZ+ (or (cid:3)clpQ+::’lacZ) fusion gene  was made 
with  different  upstream  length  of  the  clpQ+Y+  promoter. 
Each phage lysate was used to infect E. coli and the resultant 
single  phage  lysogen  was  selected.  A  single  phage  lysogen 
was  identified  by  measurement  of  (cid:2)Gal  levels  of  five 
lysogens,  and  those  with  the  lowest  expression  value  were 
selected as the single lysogens.  

The (cid:2) Gal Assays  

(cid:1)he (cid:2)Gal  activities  were  assayed  as  described  by  Miller 
[24].  The  cells  were  grown  to  log  phase,  and  activity  was 
measured  by  the  (cid:2)Gal  assay.  All  of  the  (cid:2)Gal  activity  was 
determined  in  triplicate  for  each  assay.  Each  analysis  was 
repeated at least three times.  

Northern Hybridization Assays 

The  cells  were  grown  in  5  ml  of  broth  to  exponential 
phase  at  30  oC  (OD600  about  0.5).  At  each  time  point,  total 
RNA  was  isolated  by  Qiagene  RNeasy  Mini  kits.  Equal 
amounts of total  RNA (3 μg each) were  separated under de-
naturing  conditions  in  a  1%  agarose-2.1  M  formaldehyde-
MOPS  [morpholinopropane-sulfonic  acid]  gel,  stained  with 
ethidium  bromide, 
and  blotted  onto  nitrocellulose 
(Schleicher  &  Schuell)  with  20X  SSC.  The  DNA  probes 
were  labeled  with  DIG-dUTP  by  random  priming  (Roche). 
The DNA fragments used for probes were obtained by PCR 
amplification. The 401 bp DNA fragment  corresponding the 
clpQ+ structural gene was used as a probe for clpQ+ mRNA, 
and  a  723  bp  DNA  fragment  containing  a  lacZ+  gene  was 
used as a probe for the clpQ+::lacZ+ mRNA. The membrane 
was  hybridized  with  the  appropriate  probe  and  washed.  The 
signals  were  produced  by  an  addition  of  the  anti-DIG  anti-
body  with  fluorescent  alkaline  phosphatase  conjugate  and 
CDP-star (NEB BioLabs) to the membrane and visualized by 
an exposure to an X-ray film.  

The cpsB::lacZ Assays and the Western-blot Analysis for 
ClpQ 

Cells,  AC3112  (lon,  clpQY,  cpsB::lacZ)  [10]  carrying 
plasmids  pBAD33-clpQ+,  pBAD33-(cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+,  pBAD33-
(cid:1)L-clpQ+,  pBAD33-(S-IR)-clpQ+,  or  pBAD33-(R-IR)-clpQ+ 
in  combination  with  pBAD24-clpY+  plasmids  were  grown 
overnight  on  LB  with  ampicillin  (50  μg/ml)  and  chloram-
phenicol (12.5 μg/ml) with  an addition of arabinose (0.5  %) 
to  induce  the  PBAD  promoter.  The  overnight  cultures  were 
inoculated  1:100  into  fresh  media  with  the  above  indicated 

ingredients  and  were  grown  into  log  phase,  and  then  half  of 
the  cells  were  immediately  subjected  to  the (cid:2)Gal  assays  for 
the  cpsB::lacZ  expression.  The  other  half  of  the  log  cells 
were  harvested  and  subjected  to  the  western  blot  analysis. 
The  polyclonal  ClpQ  antibody  was  used  to  detect  the  ClpQ 
protein,  which  was  separately  encoded  by  the  above  three 
plasmids  pBAD33-clpQ+,  pBAD33-(cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+  and  pBAD33- 
(cid:1)L-clpQ+.  The  procedure  was  adopted  as  described  pre- 
viously  [12].  The  western  blots  were  developed  by  the  en-
hanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).

RESULTS 
The Expression of clpQ+::lacZ Fusion Gene in (cid:3)RS45  

To  monitor  the  expression  of  the  clpQ+Y+  genes  in  E. 
coli,  two  sets  of  clpQ+::lacZ  fusion  genes  were  made;  in 
each  one,  the  clpQ+Y+  promoter  is  in  front  of  lacZ.  Both 
fused genes have  the lacZ gene under  the clpQ+Y+ promoter 
control,  but  they  carry  the  different  length  of  the  upstream 
sequence  in  either  a  transcriptional  or  a  translational  fusion 
type.  After  transferring  these  four  clpQ+::lacZ  fusion  gene 
into the (cid:3)RS45, the resulting phages, (cid:3)clpQ+::lacZ+ (op-141 
bp),  (cid:3)clpQ+::’lacZ  (pr-141  bp),  (cid:3)clpQ+::lacZ+  (op-478  bp), 
and (cid:3)clpQ+::’lacZ  (pr-478  bp),  were  separately  lysogenized 
into  a  lacZ-deficient  strain  (MC4100).  These  four  newly 
lysogens  were 
isolated,  namely,  HY20001,  HY20002, 
HY20003 and HY20004, correspondingly. The (cid:2)Gal activity 
was  then  measured  for  the  each  single  phage  lysogen.  
Despite  the  two  different  sizes  of  the  clpQ+Y+  promoter 
fragments  (141  bps  or  478  bps),  the  two  lysogens  in  a  tran-
scriptional  type  (HY20001  and  HY20003)  had  an  almost 
equal  (cid:2)Gal  activity  of  lacZ  gene  fusion  (Fig.  2);  similarly 
this  was  observed  in  a  translational  type  (HY20002  and 
HY20004)  (Fig.  2).  Thus,  only  one  set  of  lysogens  (the  op 
and  pr  lacZ  fusion  gene  with  an  identical  length  of  the  up-
stream  clpQ+Y+  promoter)  would  be  used  for  the  further 
analysis.  

ClpQ+Y+  Promoter-Mediated  Basal  and  Heat  Shock-
Induced Gene Expression Requires RpoH  

It was shown that clpQ+Y+ promoter has the RpoH ((cid:4)

32)-
binding  site  [1].  However,  a  putative  -10  site  for  an 

34    The Open Microbiology Journal, 2009, Volume 3 

Lien et al. 

38)-binding was partially overlapped with the similar 
RpoS((cid:3)
RpoH  recognition  site  (Fig.  1A).  Therefore,  to  further  iden-
tify  that  RpoH  and/or  RpoS  have  effects  on  clpQ+Y+  gene 
expression,  the  (cid:2)clpQ+::lacZ+  (op-141  bp)  was  lysogenized 
into  the  wild-type  strain  MC4100  [18],  and  mutant  strains 
KY1429 (rpoH) [19], RH90 (rpoS) [20], and the double mu-
tant SM25 (rpoH rpoS) [21]. The four resulting lysogens  all 
carried (cid:2)clpQ+::lacZ+  (op-141  bp)  as  a  prophage.  The  basal 
and heat induction of the clpQ+::lacZ+ gene expression were 
measured  among  these  four  lysogens:  HY20001  (the  wild-
type),  HY20005  (rpoS),  HY20006  (rpoH)  and  HY20007 
(rpoS  rpoH).  HY20001  and  HY20005  have  identical  (cid:1)Gal 
activity  at  30  oC  (Fig.  3).  In  contrast,  HY20006  (rpoH)  and 
HY20007 (rpoS rpoH) show a decreased (cid:1)Gal activity (Fig. 
3).  At  42  oC,  the  wild-type  HY20001  and  the  HY20005 
(rpoS)  mutant  have 
increased  (cid:1)Gal  activity,  whereas 
HY20006 (rpoH) and HY20007 (rpoS rpoH) maintain a ba-
sal  expression  (Fig.  3).  Thus,  RpoH,  but  not  the  RpoS,  ap-
pears  to  control  the  clpQ+::lacZ+  gene  expression,  and  the 
clpQ+::lacZ+ expression increases under the heat induction.

The  mRNA  Transcripts  of  clpQ+::lacZ+  and  clpQ+Y+  in 
Wild-Type and RpoH/RpoS Mutants  

from 

the  wild-type  cells 

Northern blot analyses were used to demonstrate that the 
clpQ+::lacZ+  mRNA  expression  is  well  correlated  with  its 
(cid:1)Gal  levels  in  the  above  bacterial  strains.  Total  RNA  was 
isolated 
(HY20001),  rpoS 
(HY20005),  rpoH  (HY20006),  and  rpoH  rpoS  (HY20007) 
double  mutants  at  30  oC.  Using  a  lacZ+  probe,  significant 
RNA  transcripts of clpQ+::lacZ+ were observed  in the wild-
type  and  the  rpoS  mutant,  whereas  only  a  minor  transcript 
32-deficient  mutant,  HY20006,  and  in 
was  detected  in  the  (cid:1)
the  double  mutant  rpoS  rpoH,  HY20007  (Fig.  4A).  Similar 
results  were  observed  using  a  clpQ+  probe  to  detect  the 
clpQ+Y+  mRNA  production  among  the  wild-type  and  the 
various sigma-factor deficient strains (Fig. 4B). 

Expression of clpQm1::lacZ, with a C to T Mutation in the 
-10 RpoH-biding Site  

To  reversely  show  that  a  specific  mutation  at  the  pro-
moter  region  of  clpQ+Y+  also  has  an  effect  on  its  gene  ex-

lysogens.  As  shown, 

pression,  a  C  to  T  cis-mutation  in  the  -10  promoter  region 
was  made  in  both  pRS414-clpQm1::lacZ’  and  pRS415-
clpQm1::lacZ+ plasmids.  The clpQm1 has a nucleotide substi-
tution,  5’C~CCTCATCT3’,  in  the  -10  promoter  region  dis-
tinct  from  the  consensus  sequence  for  the  RpoH-binding, 
5’C~CCCCATCT3’  (Fig.  1).  The  two  promoter  mutant 
plasmids  carrying  clpQm1::lacZ  (op  or  pr  fusion)  were  sepa-
rately transferred  into (cid:2)RS45,  and the resulting phages were 
designated  (cid:2)clpQm1::lacZ+  (op)  and  (cid:2)clpQm1::’lacZ  (pr), 
respectively.  These  two  phages  were  then  lysogenized  into 
the  wild-type  and  the  rpoH  mutant,  and  the  four  resultant 
lysogens  were  HY20020  (op),  HY20021  (op,  rpoH), 
HY20022  (pr),  and  HY20023  (pr,  rpoH).  As  a  control,  a 
lysogen  that carries  the wild-type (cid:2)clpQ::’lacZ (pr-141 bps) 
in  the  rpoH  background  was  also  made  and  named 
HY20017.  The  (cid:1)Gal  activity  was  then  measured  for  all  the 
single  phage 
the  expression  of 
clpQm1::lacZ  (op  or  pr  fusion)  was  decreased  1.7-fold  as 
compared  to  that  of  the  wild-type  (cid:2)clpQ+::lacZ  (Fig.  5) 
[compare  HY  20020  to  HY20001  (op)  at  30  oC  (Fig.  5A), 
and  HY20022  to  HY20002  (pr)  at  30  oC  in  (Fig.  5B)].  As 
shown  before,  the  wild-type  clpQ+::lacZ  (op  or  pr  fusion) 
increased its expression at 42 oC [see HY20001 at 42 oC and 
at  30  oC  (Fig.  5A)  and  HY20002  at  42  oC  and  at  30  oC  in 
(Fig. 5B)]. But the gene fusion was not activated in the rpoH 
mutant (see HY20006 at 30 oC and at 42 oC and HY20017 at 
30 oC and at 42 oC ). However, clpQm1::lacZ (op or pr fusion) 
was not highly induced at 42 oC [see HY20020 at 42 oC and 
at 30 oC (Fig. 5A) and HY20022 at 42  oC and at 30  oC (Fig. 
5B)]. In addition, in the rpoH mutant, clpQ m1::lacZ (op or pr 
fusion)  was  expressed  at  a  basal  or  at  a  slightly  lower  level 
than its expression in the wild-type cells [(Fig. 5A) and (Fig. 
5B), compare HY20021 to HY20020 and compare HY20023 
to HY20022, at 30  oC or 42  oC]. Thus, clpQm1,  carrying  a  C 
to T mutation, has a negative effect on the clpQ+Y+ promoter 
activity, and it is not activated by the RpoH.

(cid:1)40::lacZ+, with a Deletion of 40 bps 

Functional Activity of Inverted Repeat Sequence in the 5’ 
UTR of clpQ+Y+  

The  first  transcriptional  start  site  of  the  clpQ+Y+  operon 
was mapped 71 bp upstream from the translational start site. 
An UTR is present upstream from an initiation codon for the 
clpQ+Y+  operon.  It  was  logically  speculated  that  this  UTR 
might  have  an  effect  on  clpQ+::lacZ+  gene  expression.  To 
test  this  possibility,  a  clpQm2
(cid:1)40bp  mutation,  with  a  40  bp 
deletion  of  the  internal  region  of  the  UTR,  was  constructed 
in the lacZ+ gene fusion [see (Fig. 1)]. This deletion mutant, 
clpQm2
(cid:1)40::lacZ+, a transcriptional fusion type, was crossed 
into  the  (cid:3)  phage,  and  the  resulting  phage  (cid:3)RS45clpQm2 
(cid:1)40::lacZ+  (op)  was  lysogenized  into  the  wild-type  cells, 
MC4100. The newly formed lysogen, HY20019, displayed a 
significant  decrease  in  (cid:2)Gal  activity,  consistent  with  its 
mRNA production by northern blot analysis (Fig. 6). In addi-
tion, the clpQm2
(cid:1)40bp::’lacZ (pr) mutant  in  a protein fusion 
construct  (pRS414)  had  much  lower  (cid:2)Gal  activity,  and  no 
blue  plaques  could  be  selected  on  the  X-gal  plates  when 
crossed into the (cid:3) phage (data not shown). 

Most  single  strand  RNA  form  a  secondary  structure.  

Utilizing  an  in  silico  M-Fold  program  (http://frontend.bio-
info.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/)  [27],  a  predicted  stem-loop 
structure,  including  the  IR  sequence,  with  a  calculated  
(cid:1)G = -24.6 kcal/mol was identified in the untranslated leader 
region  (UTR)  upstream  of  the clpQ+Y+  structural  gene  (Fig. 
7A-a).  To  demonstrate  that  the  stem-loop  structure  is  necessary 
for the expression of clpQ+Y+, DNA fragments with different 
lengths  of  the  leader  sequence  upstream  of  clpQ+  were 
the  clpQ+  
cloned 
constructs,  with  different  upstream  sequences,  were  under 
the  heterologous  pBAD  promoter  control  (induced  by  
arabinose).  Three  different  plasmids  were  constructed  and 
designated pBAD33-clpQ+, pBAD33-(cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+ and pBAD33-
(cid:1)L-clpQ+,  and  the  secondary  structures  of  the  5’  regions  of 
their  clpQ+  mRNA  were  predicted  (Fig.  7A-a,  b,  c.)  To 
evaluate  the  physiological  activity  of  the  above  three  plas-
mids  encoded  ClpQ(s),  we  used  the  AC3112  strain  for  an 

into  plasmid  pBAD33,  and  all  of

assay of a functional ClpQ. Since AC3112, a lon clpQY mu-
tant, carries a cpsB::lacZ, it is expressed a higher (cid:2)Gal activ-
ity due to a stable activator, RcsA [9-11]. When the AC3112 
carries both pBAD33-clpQ+ and pBAD24-clpY+ plasmids, it 
has  a  decreased  (cid:2)Gal  activity  of  the  cpsB::lacZ,  due  to  an 
instability  of  RcsA,  targeted  by  the  ClpYQ  under  the  arabi-
nose  induction.  AC3112  cells  that  carry  pBAD33  and 
pBAD24, as a negative control, had higher (cid:2)Gal activities of 
cpsB::lacZ.  However,  while  cells  carrying  plasmids 
pBAD33-(cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+  or  pBAD33-(cid:1)L-clpQ+,  in  the  presence 
of  pBAD24-clpY+,  each  bacterial  strain  had  much  higher 
(cid:2)Gal  activity  from  its  cpsB::lacZ  (Fig.  7B).  Western  blot 
analysis  was  then  used  to  show  that  ClpQ  was  accumulated 

lower  in  the  cells  carrying  plasmids  pBAD33-(cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+  or 
pBAD33-(cid:1)L-clpQ+,  as  compared  to  the  cells  carrying  the 
wild-type pBAD33-clpQ+ (Fig. 7C). To further  identify  that 
the  instability  of  clpQ+  mRNA  leads  to  a  loss  of  the  func-
tional  ClpQ,  a  northern  blot  analysis  was  used  to  detect  the 
clpQ+  messages  in  all  of  the  above  strains.  As  shown,  the 
mRNA  levels  of (cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+  or (cid:1)L-clpQ+  were  much  lower 
than those of clpQ+ (Fig. 7D). In addition, the stability of the 
wild-type  clpQ+  and  (cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+  mRNAs  was  measured  at 
different time points after the addition of rifampin to the cul-
ture media  to block the re-initiation of transcription.  Results 
show that  the message of  the wild-type clpQ+  is  much  more 
stable than that of the (cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+ (Fig. 7E).

The  Stem-loop  Secondary  Structure  (IR)  of  5’UTR  of 
clpQ+Y+ Responsible for its mRNA Stability  

 To further verify that a stem-loop structure  at the 5’ end 
of  the  leader  sequences  is  responsible  for  the  stability  of 
clpQ+ mRNA, the substituted nucleotides were placed at the 
5’UTR  with  or  without  a  disruption  of  its  stable  secondary 
structure.  As  described  earlier,  the  two  new  plasmids, 
pBAD33-(S-IR)-clpQ+  and  pBAD33-(R-IR)-clpQ+
,  were 
constructed.  In  these  constructs,  the  (S-IR)-clpQ+  gene  
has  replaced  the  nucleotides  on  the  5’  end  of  UTR,  with  a 
(cid:1)G=  -10.1  kal/mol,  that  destabilized  a  stem-loop  structure 
(Fig. 8A-a); in contrast, the pBAD33-(R-IR)-clpQ+ gene has 
replaced the nucleotides on the 5’ end of UTR, with a  lower 
(cid:1)G=  -24.6  kal/mol,  that  stabilized  a  stem-loop  structure. 
AC3112  cells,  which  carry  pBAD24-clpY+  and  pBAD33-(S-
IR)-clpQ+,  show  a  higher (cid:2)Gal  activity,  as  compared  to  that 
of  cells  carrying  pBAD24-clpY+and  pBAD33-clpQ+  (Fig. 
8B). In contrast, cells that carry pBAD24-clpY+and pBAD33- 
(R-IR)-clpQ+  show  the  decreased  expression  of  cpsB::lacZ 
(Fig.  8B).  AC3112,  which  carries  pBAD33-(cid:1)IR-clpQ+  and 

pBAD24-clpY+,  has  higher  (cid:2)Gal  activity  of  the  cpsB::lacZ 
expression  as  that  of  cells  with  pBAD33  and  pBAD24  (Fig. 
8B).  In  the  northern  blot  analysis,  the  level  of  (S-IR)-clpQ+ 
message  was  much  lower  than  that  of  the  clpQ+  and  was 
more  similar  to  that  of  the (cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+;  in  contrast,  the  mes-
sage  of  (R-IR)-clpQ+  was  similar  to  that  of  the  wild-type 
clpQ+ (Fig. 8C).  

DISCUSSION 

Using a  clpQ+::lacZ, a gene fusion,  the results presented 
here show that clpQ+::lacZ has similar (cid:2)Gal activity in con-
structs  containing  either  a  long  or  a  short  region  of  the  up-
stream  sequence  of  the  clpQ+Y+  promoter.  We  have  shown 
that  the further sequence upstream of the clpQ+Y  + promoter 
has  no  significant  effects  on  its  gene  expression.  Yet,  as 
usual,  a  higher  (cid:2)Gal

Coincidentally,  clpQ+Y+  and  clpQ+::lacZ  (op  or  pr  fu-
sion) genes have  increased  expression when the temperature 
is  up-shifted  from  30  oC  to  42  oC.  Little  of  clpQ+Y+  or 
clpQ+::lacZ+  mRNA  was  observed  in  the  rpoH  mutant.  In 
addition,  a  clpQm1::lacZ+,  with  a  C  to  T  mutation  in  the 
RpoH  -10  consensus  sequences,  was  shown  to  have  de-
creased  (cid:1)Gal  activity,  independent  of  a  functional  RpoH; 
there was also no heat shock induction in clpQm1::lacZ (op or 
pr  fusion).  Using  the  transcriptional  start  site  as  a  primer 
initiating  site  in  the  RT-PCR,  the  end-product  for  the  tran-
scripts  of clpQm1::lacZ+,  was  less  accumulated  as  compared 
to  those  of  the  wild-type  clpQ+::lacZ+  (data  not  shown). 
However,  no  signal  was  detected  for  the  transcripts  of  both 
fusion  genes,  while  using  an  annealing  primer  complemen-
tary  to  the  nucleotides  upstream  of  the  transcriptional  start 
site  (data  not  shown).  These  results  indirectly  implied  that 
both clpQ+::lacZ+  and clpQm1::lacZ+ should have  the  identi-
cal  transcriptional  start  site.  In  addition,  we  also  made  an 
additional  mutation  in  the  clpQ+Y+  promoter  region  at  the 
possible  -10  site  for  the  RpoS  binding  [see  in  the  (Fig.  1)], 
and this mutation has no effects on an activity of the clpQ+Y+ 
promoter  (data  not  shown).  Therefore,  we  have  experimen-
tally shown that clpQ+Y+ gene expression is mediated by the 
RpoH factor.  

The  deletion  of  the  IR  or  UTR  in  the  (cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+, 

(cid:1)L-
clpQ+  and  the  clpQm2
(cid:1)40::lacZ  gene  fusion  leads  to  de-
creased clpQ+ mRNA. In addition, the mRNAs of (cid:1)(cid:2)R-clpQ+ 
mutants, without  a stem-loop region at the 5’-UTR, decayed 
much  faster.  However,  no  significant  sequences  were  ob-
served  in  the  5’  UTR  of  the  clpQ+Y+  messages  acting  as  a 
signal  for  targeting  by  the  RNase  E  degradosome  (an  AU 
rich or A/GAUU/AU) [28, 29] or the RNase III (A/UNAGA/ 
UG)  [30].  We  also  found  that  a  functional  ClpQ  is  not  af-
fected  by  a  higher  temperature  (data  not  shown);  thus,  there 
is  no  thermo-sensitive  segment  in  the clpQ+  message.  How-
ever,  while  obliterated  the  IR  in  the  5’  UTR  of  clpQ+Y+ 
mRNA  but  retained  its  stem-loop  structure,  a  stable  mRNA 
was present. In E. coli, it has been reported that the 5’ stem-
loop structure stabilizes  the mRNA of papA (pyelonephritis-
associated  pili  gene)  [31]  and  ompA  (outer  membrane  pro-
tein) [32, 33] under physiological conditions, and it was later 
found  that ompA  is  being  regulated  by  the  small micA  RNA 
[34].  Currently,  a  model  is  emerging  of  small  RNA  se-
quences  that  are  involved  in  gene  regulation  [35].  In  some 
cases,  an Hfq (a host factor for RNA phage Q(cid:1) phage repli-
cation) [36], RNA-binding protein is also involved in it [35]. 
It stabilizes sRNAs against decay  and also helps  an associa-
tion with their mRNA target [35]. However, no such effects 
were found for the clpQ+::lacZ+ fusion gene expression (our 
own data). Besides, in the wild bacterial genome, the 5’ UTR 
was  also  found  in  the  clpQ+Y+  mRNA  transcripts  mainly  in 
the  Enterobacteriaceae  family.  These  bacteria  all  have  the 
conserved sequences of the 5’ UTR of clpQ+Y+ mRNA for a 
predicted  secondary  stem-loop  structure.  However,  via  the 
bioinformatics,  the  conservation  of  sequence  of  the  small 
RNA  is  not  sufficient  for  a  searching  of  a  regulation  of  the 
target gene; a more sophisticated algorithm is needed [37]. It 
is  noteworthy  that  this  is  the  first  example  in  the  ATP-
dependent  proteases  to  demonstrate  that  the  5’  stem-loop 
structure  itself participates  in  the stability of  its downstream 
mRNA.  It  is  of  interest  to  determine  whether  this  stem-loop 

structure  in  the  5’UTR  plays  a  role  for  its  gene  expression 
under certain physiological condition and also whether there 
is a regulation of clpQ+Y+ by the other regulatory proteins or 
via the small RNA.
