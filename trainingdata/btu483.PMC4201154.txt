To this purpose, we developed MToolBox, a highly automated pipeline to reconstruct and analyze human mito- chondrial DNA from high-throughput sequencing data.
Results: MToolBox implements an effective computational strategy for mitochondrial genomes assembling and haplogroup assignment also including a prioritization analysis of detected variants.
MToolBox provides a Variant Call Format file featuring, for the first time, allele-specific heteroplasmy and annotation files with prioritized variants.
MToolBox was tested on simulated samples and applied on 1000 Genomes WXS datasets.
Availability and implementation: MToolBox package is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtoolbox/.

On the other hand, the deeper the sequen- cing coverage, the higher the number of mitochondrial DNA  *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(mtDNA) variants and the variety of heteroplasmic ranges found per individual (Diroma et al., 2014  He et al., 2010  Payne et al., 2013).
In this frame, the deep sequencing of mtDNA raises the demand of effective pipelines to accurately measure heteroplasmy and to easily recognize the most function- ally important variants among a huge number of candidates.
To this purpose, we developed MToolBox, a highly automated bio- informatics pipeline to reconstruct and analyze human mtDNA from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data.
The MToolBox workflow includes a computational strategy to assemble mito- chondrial genomes from whole-exome sequencing (WXS) and/or whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data (Picardi and Pesole, 2012), which was further updated to detect insertions and dele- tions (ins/dels) and to assess the heteroplasmic fraction (HF) of each variant allele with the related confidence interval (CI), reported as sample-specific meta-information in an enhanced version of the Variant Call Format (VCF) file (version 4.0).
The MToolBox pipeline analyzes the reconstructed genomes for haplogroup assignment (Rubino et al., 2012) and variant prioritization.
2 METHODS  2.1 Mitochondrial reads extraction, genome reconstruction and VCF file generation  The MToolBox pipeline integrates in a unique automatic workflow a computational strategy for mtDNA data extraction from WXS and WGS data (Picardi and Pesole, 2012), where new important features have been added.
MToolBox can accept as input raw data or prealigned reads (Fig.
1a).
In both cases, reads are mapped/remapped by the mapExome.py script (Fig.
1b) at user s choice either onto the Reconstructed Sapiens Reference Sequence (RSRS  Behar et al., 2012) or the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS  Andrews et al., 1999).
Subsequently, reads mapped on mtDNA are realigned onto the nuclear genome (GRCh37/hg19), to discard Nuclear mitochondrial Sequences (NumtS  Simone et al., 2011  Fig.
1c) and amplification artifacts.
The resulting Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) file (Fig.
1d) can be optionally processed for ins/dels realignment around a set of  ÃŸ The Author 2014.

full compatibility of the resulting annotation with the current clinical literature (Bandelt et al., 2014).
3 RESULTS  The MToolBox performance in heteroplasmy detection was tested on four artificial heteroplasmic samples, whose sequencing was simulated at different mean depth (Supplementary Information).
MToolBox showed high specificity and sensitivity in detecting all the artificial heteroplasmy tested, with an average coverage depth equal or above 1000 .
MToolBox was exten- sively applied on WXS data from 1000 Genomes (Genomes Project et al., 2012 and Supplementary Information), to obtain a VCF file of mtDNA variants from 2419 individuals (available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtoolbox/files/1000Genomes_ data/).
Reliability of reconstructed mitochondrial genomes was confirmed by their haplogroup predictions, the majority of which coherent with the related individual (Supplementary Information).
The accuracy in heteroplasmy de- tection and quantification was confirmed by the results from four mother child pairs that showed the expected pattern of mtDNA inheritance (Supplementary Information).
ancestry of  the  4 DISCUSSION  A highly automated pipeline for mtDNA analysis from HTS data is not available to date.
To fill this gap, we developed MToolBox, an effective workflow with customizable parameters and able to analyze multiple samples in a single run.
MToolBox is the only tool that generates as output a VCF file, the standard format for large-scale genotyping information, suitably custo- mized for mitochondrial data, by including the heteroplasmy fraction and its related CI.
In fact, also the MitoSeek tool (Guo et al., 2013) performs mitochondrial HTS data ana- lyses, including somatic and structural variant recognition.
Additionally, MToolBox provides the user with essential ana- lyses of reconstructed mitochondrial genomes, i.e.
haplogroup assignment and variant prioritization, exploiting a broad collec- tion of annotation resources.
Thus, MToolBox may provide a valuable support for the recognition of candidate mitochondrial mutations in clinical studies.

All the genomic variants are filtered based on the quality scores and read depth, and annotated in a VCF file (v.4.0), with the corresponding HF and CI values (Fig.

Each set of con- tigs is subjected to haplogroup prediction, relying on the RSRS-based Phylotree resource (van Oven and Kayser, 2009), by mt-classifier (Fig.
1l), an updated version of the fragment-classify tool (Rubino et al., 2012), which now includes a module to perform functional annotation and pri- oritization of mitochondrial variants (Fig.
1m and Supplementary Information).
This latter analysis is carried out by aligning each sample-specific related macro- haplogroup-specific consensus sequence (Supplementary Information) to recognize, via a prioritization process, private variants, deserving fur- ther clinical investigation.
The prioritization takes into account also the pathogenicity of each mutated allele, determined with different algo- rithms, and the nucleotide variability of each variant site  amino acid variability is also considered if codogenic (Supplementary Information).
For each mutated allele, additional anno- tations are also reported, i.e.
annotation from HmtDB and MITOMAP resources and their occurrence among 1000 Genomes Project samples (Supplementary Information).
