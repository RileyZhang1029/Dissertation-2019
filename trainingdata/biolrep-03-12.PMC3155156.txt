Abstract
Gut microbes are essential components of the human organism—helping us metabolize food into
energy, produce micronutrients, and shape our immune systems. Having a particular pattern of gut
microbes is also increasingly being linked to medical conditions including obesity, inflammatory bowel
disease, and diabetes. Recent studies now indicate that our resident intestinal bacteria may also play a
critical role in determining one’s risk of developing cancer, ranging from protection against cancer to
promoting its initiation and progression. Gut bacteria are greatly influenced by diet and in this review
we explore evidence that they may be the missing piece that explains how dietary intake influences
cancer risk, and discuss possible prevention and treatment strategies.

Introduction and context
Like many great political alliances, symbiotic relation-
ships in biology may have started with antagonism, even
parasitism, before two parties reached mutual under-
standing—at least according to some evolutionary bio-
logists. The example that is most often quoted is the
mitochondria, the eukaryotic cell’s energy-supplying
organelle, which may have first graced this planet as
a prokaryotic cell. As the story goes, this prokaryote
infected a second cell and eventually formed such a close
symbiotic relationship that one could not live without the
other. This mutual dependence, however, formed over
many millennia.

Our own symbionts, the microbes that reside throughout
our bodies, and primarily in our guts, have a more
independent—some might say rocky—relationship with
us, their hosts.

Although these bacteria have long been called com-
mensal (in which only one party derives benefit, but
neither is harmed), it is clear that we draw many benefits
from their colonization, some of them essential to our
health. However, our relationship with gut bacteria is

complicated. While gut microbes are essential—helping
us metabolize food into energy, produce micronutrients,
and shape our immune systems—they are also increas-
ingly being linked to medical conditions including
obesity,
inflammatory bowel disease, and diabetes.
Their influence is not restricted to the effects related to
gastrointestinal processes: these symbiotic bacteria may
play a critical role across the continuum of cancer, from
protection against cancer to promoting its initiation and
progression.

One often-cited example of the dangerous side of our gut
bacteria is Helicobacter pylori, the bacteria responsible for
many stomach ulcers, as well as some cancers. Gastric
MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma, a
cancer that occurs in the stomach, is frequently associated
with H. pylori. Not surprisingly then, antibiotics that kill
this bacterium cure upwards of 80% of these patients.
This infection is also an important risk factor for gastric
cancer, which is much more difficult to treat as antibiotics
provide no cure. However, harboring this bacterium does
not automatically lead to cancer: the guts of almost two-
thirds of the world’s population are home to H. pylori, yet
cancer occurs in only a fraction of individuals.

Another example is a toxin-producing Bacteroides fragilis
strain that initiates colon cancer in mice and may also do
so in humans [1]. This bacterial toxin is a metalloprotease
that can drive cleavage of E-cadherin, which then leads to
activation of the b-catenin/Wnt pathway, an overactive
pathway in almost all colon cancers. In addition,
exposure to the toxin activates a transcription factor,
nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), which plays important
roles in initiation and promotion of epithelial tumor-
igenesis and is best known as a master regulator of
inflammatory response pathways. This strain also drives
inflammation, which creates additional conditions that
promote cancer formation and progression. Much of the
current thinking about how bacteria may contribute to
cancers, particularly those of the gastrointestinal tract,
involves inflammation.

While many species of bacteria can activate inflamma-
tion, it is when bacteria initiate chronic inflammation
that cancer risk increases significantly. Inflammatory
mediators, like reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, are
part of our defense against bacterial pathogens. Persis-
tent exposure to these mediators directly damages host
DNA and contributes to genomic instability—a common
feature of cancer cells. Certain cytokines and chemokines
produced by immune cells function as growth factors or
promoters of angiogenesis. NF-kB and STATs (signal
transducers and activators of transcription), STAT3 in
particular, are transcription factors vital to physiologic
inflammatory responses, and are key molecular links
connecting inflammation to cancer [2,3].

The innate arm of the immune system’s microbial sensors,
which recognize patterns shared across many microbes,
have recently been shown to intersect with tumor growth
pathways. Several studies in mouse models suggest that
Toll-like receptors (a major family of receptors that bind
these microbe-associated patterns) and their adaptor
proteins, such as MyD88, can promote tumorigenesis by
affecting both tumor number and size. A seminal paper
authored by Seth Rakoff-Nahoum and Ruslan Medzhitov
in 2007 [4] showed that tumor development, driven by
a heterozygous mutation in the adenomatous polyposis
coli gene in mice, was profoundly influenced by MyD88-
dependent signaling.

Additionally, the laboratory of Maria Abreu found that
deficiencies in Toll-like receptor-4 could prevent colon
cancers that usually arise in the setting of chronic
inflammation [5]. When overexpressed, this receptor
was associated with an increased susceptibility to colon
cancer in mice [6]. Patients with colitis-associated
cancer also had elevated Toll-like receptor-4 levels,
raising the possibility of a novel therapeutic target.

A recent study provides additional insight into MyD88’s
roles in cancer. MyD88 signaling can alter the stability of
c-Myc, an oncoprotein, and activate the epidermal growth
factor receptor pathway [7]—two elements often dysre-
gulated in colon cancer. Collectively,
these findings
suggest
that host-signaling pathways that evolved to
sense the microbiota can influence cancer development
and growth.

But there are other ways that bacteria might contribute
to cancer. One of the first recognized beneficial effects
on human health was the role our gut bacteria played
in digestion and metabolism. Indeed, a look at these
bacterial functions is revealing alternate mechanisms by
which our gut bacteria both hinder and promote cancer
development.

Eating for two
Successful adaptation to the ever-changing human diet
is central to the survival of gut microbes. The laboratory
of Jeffrey Gordon at Washington University of St. Louis
is answering key questions about how diet influences
gut bacteria and what has made certain bacteria such
successful symbionts. Several other laboratories such
as Andy Goodman’s at Yale, Ruth Ley’s at Cornell,
Justin Sonnenburg’s at Stanford, and Peter Turnbaugh’s
at Harvard are now actively investigating the genetic
features that make bacteria successful, and what allows
them to rapidly respond to dietary changes. The ‘Western
diet,’ a dietary pattern high in fats and simple sugars,
can reshape gut microbial ecology and predispose both
mice and humans to obesity—a risk factor for certain
cancers. Changing from a Western diet to a more prudent
(plant-polysaccharide rich) low-fat diet reduces weight
and shrinks fat stores in humans and mice, and causes
marked shifts in gut microbiota. Researchers observed
that after these dietary changes had been adopted long
enough to reduce the weight of human subjects and
mice,
their gut microbiota
looked more similar to those of lean control subjects.
These experiments provided functional evidence that the
gut microbiota may impact energy metabolism and the
propensity for obesity [8-10].

the bacterial profiles of

Gut bacteria do much to supplement our metabolism.
The indigestible leftovers of our diet serve as the major
food source for these resident bacteria,
the greatest
numbers of which reside in the distal gut or the large
intestine. They metabolize many dietary fibers that
escape host digestion, generating short-chain fatty acids
such as acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, which supply
an estimated 10% of our daily energy supply [11]. The
amount and variety produced are determined by
the types of food ingested, how long the food stays in

the gut, and by the bacterial species present in the gut.
While humans have the capacity to generate some
short-chain fatty acids, the vast majority are produced
by the gut microbiota. However, these metabolites do
more than provide us with extra energy.

infection from pathogenic bacteria,

Approximately 95% of gut short-chain fatty acids are
absorbed and metabolized by the host for a wide range
of physiological functions. Microbial-generated acetate
has been shown to bind a G-protein-coupled receptor,
GPR43, expressed on immune cells. Deletion of this
receptor in mice exacerbated arthritis, asthma, and coli-
tis suggesting that
the microbiota’s production of
acetate may help guide the resolution of inflammatory
responses [12]. Acetate also appears to protect the host
against
like the
intestinal hemorrhage-causing Escherichia coli 0157, by
strengthening epithelial barrier function [13]. Propionic
acid may also play a role in modulating T helper cell
immune responses. However, published observations
on butyrate’s effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis
appear contradictory, making it difficult to interpret its
role in cancer prevention and promotion. Butyrate’s
role as an important energy source for certain epithelial
cells types is well established, as is its inhibition of
histone deacetylase enzymes. Exposure to butyrate favors
histone acetylation allowing DNA within chromatin to
become more accessible for transcription-factor binding.
Some of butyrate’s anticancer effects may involve its
ability to change microRNA expression. A recent study
by the laboratory of Eugene Chang at the University of
Chicago suggests that butyrate slowed the proliferation
of a cancer cell line by altering microR106b levels [14].
This family of microRNAs plays important roles in regu-
lating cell cycle progression and is often overexpressed
in cancers.

While the mechanistic details of these relationships still
need ironing out, such findings, including those from
Jeffrey Gordon’s group, have ignited the field and are
encouraging investigators to look more closely at diet and
its influence on gut bacteria, and how these two factors
together can influence predisposition to cancer. Support
for studying these connections is gaining momentum, and
there are an increasing number of funding opportunities
and conferences sponsored by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) and private foundations.

From food to cancer
Health experts often tout one type of food or another for
their cancer-preventing or cancer-causing properties.
While certain foods can increase or decrease a person’s
chances of developing cancer, researchers are beginning
to realize that we can’t think of the food we ingest

without thinking of the gut bacteria that also ingest our
food. One often-cited example is the polyphenol family
of chemicals, predominantly found in coffee, tea, wine,
fruit, and vegetables, which have been implicated in
reducing the risk of cancer. The three main classes of
dietary polyphenols include flavonoids, phenolic acids,
and lignans. Escaping digestion and absorption in the
upper gastrointestinal tract of the host, polyphenols are
most readily metabolized in the colon by microbial
enzymes. While several members of the Bacteroides genus
have been shown to metabolize polyphenols, determin-
ing the members and role of colonic microbial commu-
nity in the metabolism of polyphenols is an evolving
field that will require both metabolomic and meta-
genomic approaches, as well as carefully crafted animal
studies and human trials [15]. Investigations headed
by Tom van de Wiele’s group in the Laboratory of
Microbial Ecology and Technology at Ghent University
have shown that polyphenol consumption in healthy
human subjects results in distinct metabolic profiles that
are unique to each individual and their microbiota [16].
The metabolism of polyphenols changes their bioavail-
ability;
the variability of health benefits
observed in epidemiological studies may be attributable
to the composition and relative abundance of the gut
microbiota. In addition, our food isn’t our only source
of polyphenols: clinical studies have shown that
when human subjects are given a measured quantity of
polyphenols, more polyphenols are produced than
consumed [17].

therefore,

A number of polyphenols, produced by microbes or
ingested directly, have anticancer properties. Ellagic acid—
found in berries and nuts—is one of many plant poly-
phenol compounds thought to have anti-inflammatory
and anticancer benefits. Our gut microbiota are essential
for metabolizing ellagic acid into urolithins—compounds
believed to be responsible for reducing inflammation and
thereby protecting against cancer. The laboratory of Juan
Carlos Espín De Gea at the Spanish National Research
Council has investigated the anti-inflammatory effects
of urolithins in chocolate. In cell culture, urolithin-A was
found to down-regulate mRNA expression and protein
levels of cyclooxygenase-2—a prostaglandin synthase
and a key inflammatory mediator that is inhibited by
aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
[18]. They also showed that urolithin-A inhibited the
activation of transcription factors like NF-kB and signaling
pathways that drive inflammation [19]. Investigators from
this lab have also observed similar results in vivo with a
rodent model of intestinal inflammation.

Although it is known that a substantial portion of
polyphenol metabolites are generated by bacteria in the

gut, just how microbiota interact with polyphenols is
still not fully understood. In some cases, polyphenols
are toxic to microbes. Numerous flavonoid compounds
have been able to kill both Gram-positive and Gram-
negative organisms in vitro [20]; however, it is not known
how dietary phenols may alter microbial composition.

In other cases, polyphenols such as the isoflavones
produced by soy and other plants act as antioxidants
that mitigate oxidative stress, which is often linked to
cancer. Just how soy may modify cancer risk is far from
clear. Like other antioxidants, isoflavones are thought to
reduce inflammation that predisposes tissues to cancer.
The soy isoflavone daidzein is metabolized by certain
gut microbes into equol, a plant estrogen. Because of
their hormone-like properties, soy isoflavones have been
found to have protective effects against prostate cancer;
however, these findings are not always consistent across
studies [21]. One reason for these inconsistencies could
be individual differences in how gut microbes metabo-
lize isoflavones. According to epidemiological studies,
only 30–50% of the human population is capable of
producing equol. Studies of populations that consume
a high level of soy, mostly of Asian descent, have found
that equol producers may have a greater reduction in
cancer risk than those who do not produce equol [22].
Generally, interpretation of the soy–cancer prevention
literature is challenging due to differences in study
protocols for monitoring soy intake and measuring the
secretion of soy metabolites, and also differences in
stratification of subjects based on metabolic profiles. In
the future, pairing studies that examine long-term health
outcomes with microbial metagenomic analyses that
include food frequency data from diverse populations
around the world may help to resolve some of the
outstanding questions about soy and cancer risk.
Although more research is needed to understand the
role of our gut microbiota in mediating cancer risk,
metabolites such as urolithins, polyphenols, and equol
show promise against cancer.

We are studying the effects of dietary interventions such
as fermented dairy products and risk-associated foods
such as red meat on the microbiota and colon cancer.
Our group uses mouse models to control many genetic
and environmental factors that complicate human studies
of the microbiota and diet. In addition, we make use of
mice where we can design the microbial communities
from scratch by first generating and breeding mice
without any bacteria and then adding back the select
bacteria we choose. These so-called germ-free mice can
also be transplanted with human fecal samples, which can
to some extent ‘humanize’ these mice.

An incomplete symbiosis
Our gut microbiota, when fed certain foods, can also
produce detrimental metabolites that promote cellular
proliferation and inhibit apoptosis—auspicious circum-
stances for cancer development. Heterocyclic amines
(HCAs)—the char that graces any well-done steak—are
considered procarcinogenic. These compounds resist
digestion in the small intestine but remain available for
fermentation by bacteria in the colon. Once metabolized
by gut bacteria, HCAs are converted to electrophilic
derivatives that damage DNA, placing people at
increased risk for colon cancer [23].

Hydrogen sulfide is another metabolite produced by gut
bacteria that can damage DNA. Consumption of high-
protein foods, particularly red meat, may fuel hydrogen
sulfide production by sulfur-reducing gut microbes. Some
studies suggest
that patients with colon cancer and
inflammatory bowel disease may harbor higher levels of
sulfur-producing bacteria. Studies by Rex Gaskins’s lab
at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which
investigates the role of sulfate-reducing bacteria in cancer,
suggest that hydrogen sulfide can contribute to cancer
progression when DNA repair mechanisms are impaired
[24]. Whether a greater abundance of sulfur-producing
bacteria precedes, or is a result of, these health conditions,
and what host factors contribute, requires further inves-
tigation. In high-risk individuals, these metabolites may
offer targets for cancer prevention.

While we wait for interest from drug companies to
develop these targets, some admittedly low-tech solutions
have presented themselves. Although not performed
frequently, fecal transplants have been used for many
decades,
though mostly to treat Clostridium difficile-
associated severe diarrhea and colitis. Increasing antibiotic
resistance has renewed interest in alternative bacterio-
therapy [25] and its success is raising interest in its use
for other ailments.

“It takes a village”: the power of community
Although the link between gut microbes and cancer risk
will gain prominence, it will probably be years before
dropping off a fecal sample at the doctor’s office will
generate a report of your cancer risk or foods you should
or shouldn’t eat to modify that risk. Further experimen-
tation is needed to understand the genomic potential
and function of the human microbiota. Some of the
current bottlenecks are in data processing and analysis.

Indeed, because discoveries of single bacterial species
leading to cancer have proven to be the exception, not
the rule, the focus is shifting from single organism

studies to bacterial communities as a factor influencing
cancer risk. Worldwide consortia such as the Human
Microbiome Project [26,27] and the Metagenomics of
the Human Intestinal Tract project (MetaHIT) [28-30]
are applying sequencing-based approaches to study the
microbiota of healthy and disease-affected individuals.
The emerging field of microbial “omics”, which encom-
passes metagenomics (the total collection of genomes
from a microbial community) and metabonomics (the
global changes in genes, proteins, and metabolites in
a living system [31]), is rapidly advancing. With the
decreasing cost of generating microbial metagenomic
data and evolving computational tools to analyze it,
more investigators will have an enhanced ability to ask
new questions about gut bacteria.

Cancer genomics has offered the potential to understand
how cancers operate at the molecular level. Microbial
metagenomics may have the potential to improve many
aspects of cancer prevention and treatment as well. Current
studies like the esophageal cancer microbiome project,
a joint venture spearheaded by Karen Nelson from the
J. Craig Venter Institute and New York University’s Zhiheng
Pei, aim to identify microbiota-based biomarkers that
can identify patients at high risk for developing cancer.
Successful biomarker identification will spark interest in
the microbiota as a prognostic, diagnostic, and manage-
ment tool, allowing gut microbiota testing to become part
of the evolving personalized medicine tool kit.

In cancer care, cancer genomics and pharmacoge-
nomics are increasingly employed to identify which
patients will respond to what treatments and whether
particular patients are at risk for developing dangerous
drug toxicities. Enzymes produced by gut microbes can
often interact with drugs and contribute to side effects
or change how the drug is metabolized by the body.
A recent study showed that gut bacterial enzymes called
b-glucuronidases can contribute to the severe diarrhea
that is sometimes associated with a commonly used
colon cancer chemotherapy drug called irinotecan [32].
Selectively targeting these bacterial enzymes reduced a
potentially life-threatening side effect of this drug.

The day may not be so far off when fecal samples are
biobanked for future transplant or high-risk cancer
microbiota may be transplanted with lower-risk micro-
biota. Foods or bacterial-directed therapies may be used
to re-engineer gut microbial communities with functions
that reduce cancer risk. As we come to understand what
features constitute a healthy microbiota and how the
microbiota changes across the human lifecycle,
the
plasticity and genomic potential of our gut microbes may
be realized as a fountain of youth and health. As far as

symbiotic relationships go, ours appears to be continually
evolving, and Western dietary patterns may be pushing
us into a tumultuous relationship. A deeper understand-
ing of the effects of dietary intake on our microbiota will
hopefully lead us toward a more perfect union.
