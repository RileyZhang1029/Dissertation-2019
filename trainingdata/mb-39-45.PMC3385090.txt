This  work  was  conducted  to  investigate  dietary  supplementation  of  oyster  mushroom  fruiting  bodies  on  biochemical  and
histological  changes  in  hyper  and  normocholesterolemic  rats.  Six-week  old  female  Sprague-Dawley  albino  rats  were  divided
into  three  groups  of  10  rats  each.  Feeding  a  diet  containing  a  5%  powder  of  Pleurotus  ostreatus  fruiting  bodies  to  hyper-
cholesterolemic  rats  reduced  plasma  total  cholesterol,  triglyceride,  low-density  lipoprotein  (LDL),  total  lipid,  phospholipids,
and  LDL/high-density  lipoprotein  ratio  by  30.18,  52.75,  59.62,  34.15,  23.89,  and  50%,  respectively.  Feeding  oyster  mushrooms
also  significantly  reduced  body  weight  in  hypercholesterolemic  rats.  However,  it  had  no  adverse  effects  on  plasma  albumin,
total  bilirubin,  direct  bilirubin,  creatinin,  blood  urea  nitrogen,  uric  acid,  glucose,  total  protein,  calcium,  sodium,  potassium,
chloride,  inorganic  phosphate,  magnesium,  or  enzyme  profiles.  Feeding  mushroom  increased  total  lipid  and  cholesterol  excre-
tion  in  feces.  The  plasma  lipoprotein  fraction,  separated  by  agarose  gel  electrophoresis,  indicated  that  P.  ostreatus  significantly
reduced  plasma  β  and  pre-β-lipoprotein  but  increased  α-lipoprotein.  A  histological  study  of  hepatic  cells  by  conventional
hematoxylin-eosin  and  oil  red  O  staining  revealed  normal  findings  for  mushroom-fed  hypercholesterolemic  rats.  These  results
suggest  that  a  5%  P.  ostreatus  diet  supplement  provided  health  benefits  by  acting  on  the  atherogenic  lipid  profile  in  hyper-
cholesterolemic  rats.

Pleurotus  ostreatus,  the  oyster  mushroom,  is  increasingly
being recognized as an important food product with a sig-
nificant role in human health and nutrition [1]. It is gener-
ally  accepted  that  lowering  high  plasma  cholesterol  levels
plays a significant role in preventing  atherosclerosis. Oys-
ter  mushrooms  are  an  ideal  dietary  substance  for  the  pre-
vention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia due to high
content  of  dietary  fiber,  sterol,  proteins,  and  microele-
ments [2].

The fact that lovastatin is present in high proportions in
this  mushroom,  is  an  important  food  supplement  for
patients  suffering  from  hypercholesterolemia  [3].  Besides
lovastatin, P. ostreatus contains various biologically active
phenolic  compounds  such  as  gallic  acid,  protocatechuic
acid, chlorogenic acid, naringenin, hesperetin, and biocha-
nin-A  [4].  The  general  idea  that  controlling  blood  choles-
terol  is  an  important  for  reducing  the  risk  of  developing
atherosclerosis  [5]  has  stimulated  the  investigation  and  study
of natural substances with hypocholesterolemic activity.

Considering  the  widely  accepted  concept  about  the  key
role of reactive oxygen species in the pathogenesis of ath-
erosclerosis  [6],  reduced  lipid  peroxidation  in  blood  is  an
additional  positive  effect  of  oyster  mushrooms.  Oyster
mushrooms  and  other  related  mushrooms  are  used  in  tra-
ditional  oriental  medicine  as  components  of  natural  diets

with an antisclerotic effect [7].

There is considerable data supporting the hypothesis that
the health benefit obtained through lowering blood choles-
terol  may  be  derived  from  the  effects  of  eicosapentaenoic
acid  and  docosahexaenoic  acid  [8].  In  addition  to  their
roles  in  the  development  and  functioning  of  the  central
nervous  system,  these  two  fatty  acids  play  an  important
role  in  the  physiological  functions  of  the  cardiovascular
system [9].

A  hypolipidemic  activity  study  is  pertinent  because  the
hypolipidemic  activity  of  P.  ostreatus  is  essential  for  its
antiatherosclerotic function. Moreover, P. ostreatus has the
potential  to  serve  as  an  effective  therapeutic  agent  for
hyperlipidemic  diseases,  especially  cardiovascular  disease.
Despite  the  medicinal  importance  of  P.  ostreatus  and  its
therapeutic  potential,  no  detailed  studies  on  the  biochemi-
cal and histological function of hypercholesterolemia have
been performed, and comprehensive studies on the antihy-
perlepidemic  effects  of  this  mushroom  are  not  available.
Therefore  we  examined  the  potential  hypolipidemic  activity
of P. ostreatus to generate awareness of its health benefit.

Materials  and  Methods

Mushroom. Fresh  fruiting  bodies  of  P.  ostreatus  (culti-
var  Chun-chu  2)  were  obtained  from  Hanultari  mush-
room  farm,  Korea.  A  pure  culture  was  deposited  in  the

Alam  et  al.

Culture  Collection  and  DNA  Bank  of  Mushroom,  Division
of  Life  Sciences,  University  of  Incheon,  Korea  with  the
acquired accession number, IUM-4143. Fresh fruiting bodies
were dried with hot air at 40oC for 48 hr and pulverized.

Animals. Thirty  female  Sprague-Dawley  albino  rats  (101
± 4.2 g,  6-week  old,  purchased  from  Central  Lab.  Animal
Inc.,  Seoul,  Korea)  were  used.  All  animals  were  accli-
mated  to  the  animal  room  for  1-week.  The  rats  were
housed in an animal room at 23 ± 2oC under a 12 hr dark-
light  cycle  (17:00~5:00 hr)  and  relative  humidity  of  50~
60%.  Rats  were  divided  into  three  feed  groups:  a  basal
diet (normocholesterolemic control rats; NC rats), basal diet
with  1%  cholesterol  (hypercholesterolemic  rats;  HC  rats),
and  a  basal  diet  with  1%  cholesterol  and  5%  P.  ostreatus
powder  (oyster  mushroom-fed  hypercholesterolemic  rats;
HC + PO  rats).  The  basal  diet  compositions  are  presented
in Table 1, and the rats were feed for 42 days.

Plasma  chemical  analysis. At  the  end  of  the  experimen-
tal  period,  overnight-fasted  animals  were  sacrificed  under
injectable  anesthetic  (Zoletil  50;  VIRBAC  Laboratories,
Carros, France). Blood samples were collected with a dis-
posable plastic syringe into heparinized tubes. Plasma was
prepared by centrifugation at 2,493 ×g for 10 min. Plasma
triglyceride  (TG)  concentration  was  measured  enzymati-
cally  using  the  glycerophosphate  oxidase  assay.  Plasma
total  cholesterol  (TC),  high-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol
(HDL-C),  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (LDL-C),
very  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (VLDL-C),  total
lipid  (TL),  and  phospholipid  (PL)  levels  were  measured
enzymatically  by  the  cholesterol  oxidase  assay  [10]  using

commercially  available  assay  kits  (Sekisui  Medical  Co.,
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Plasma albumin, total bilirubin, direct
bilirubin,  creatinin,  blood  urea  nitrogen,  uric  acid,  glucose,
total  protein,  and  electrolyte  parameters,  including  calcium,
sodium,  potassium,  chloride,  inorganic  phosphate,  and
magnesium  were  measured  by  standard  methods  using  an
auto analyzer (Hitachi 7600-210; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).

Very  low  density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  was  calculated

as follows:

VLDL-C = [TC − (HDL-C + LDL-C)]

Plasma  enzyme  analysis. The  activity  of  the  plasma
transaminases,  glutamate  pyruvate  transaminase  (GPT),
and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) were deter-
mined  using  the  kinetic  method  [10].  The  oxoacids  formed
in  the  transaminase  reactions  were  measured  indirectly  by
enzymatic  reduction  to  their  corresponding  hydroxyacids.
The  accompanying  change  in  NADH  concentration  was
measured  at  340 nm  using  a  spectrophotometer  (Optizen
POP;  Mecasys  Co.  Ltd.,  Daejeon,  Korea).  Plasma  alka-
line  phosphatase  (ALP)  activity  was  determined  using  4-
nitrophenyl phosphate. ALP catalyzes the hydrolysis of 4-
nitrophenyl  phosphate,  forming  phosphate  and  free  4-
nitrophenol,  which  is  colorless  in  dilute  acid  solutions.
But,  under  alkaline  conditions  4-nitrophenol  is  converted
to  the  4-nitrophenoxide  ion,  which  is  an  intense  yellow
color.  The  absorbance  of  this  color  compound  was  mea-
sured  spectrophotometrically  at  420 nm  to  determine  plasma
ALP activity.

Fecal cholesterol and TL analysis. Feces were collected
for  7  days  before  and  at  the  end  of  42  days,  lyophilized,
and  then  milled  into  powder.  Total  lipids  were  extracted
with  chloroform/methanol  (2 : 1  v/v)  according  to  the
method  of  Folch  et  al.  [11].  One  gram  of  fecal  powder
was mixed with 10 mL of chloroform and 5 mL of metha-
nol  solution  and  stirred  at  150 rpm  for  3  days  at  room
temperature.  The  suspension  was  filtered  through  What-
man  No.  2  filter  paper  (Whatman,  Maidstone,  UK),  the
methanol  was  aspirated,  and  the  chloroform  was  evapo-
rated. The extracted lipids were then weighed. Two mL of
H2O  was  added,  and  a  suspension  was  created  using  a
bath sonicator. This suspension was used to estimate fecal
cholesterol  content,  which  was  estimated  by  the  enzy-
matic method using the cholesterol oxidase assay.

Plasma  lipoprotein  separation  by  agarose  gel  electro-
phoresis. Plasma lipoprotein fractions were determined by
agarose gel electrophoresis [12]. Three lipoprotein fractions
were  detected  by  electrophoresis,  which  will  henceforth  be
referred to as β-lipoprotein (LDL), pre-β-lipoprotein (VLDL),
and α-lipoprotein (HDL). Sample application (2 µL), elec-
trophoresis (80 V, 30 min), staining (Fat Red 7B), drying, and

densitometric  scanning  (525 nm)  were  performed  automati-
cally by the Helena TITAN GEL Lipoprotein Electrophore-
sis  System  (Helena  Laboratories,  Beaumont,  TX,  USA).
After  electrophoresis,  lipoprotein  fractions  were  visualized
with  enzymatic  staining  reagents.  The  visualized  gel  plate
was  scanned  on  a  densitometer,  and  the  lipoprotein  scan-
ning  patterns  were  identified  using  analytical  software  (elec-
trophoresis  data  bank,  K.K.  Helena  Laboratories,  Saitama,
Japan).  The  scanned  patterns  were  divided  into  lipopro-
tein  fractions  using  the  nadirs  of  the  lipoprotein  sequen-
tial curve. Lipoprotein levels were estimated from the area
percentages and total concentrations.

Histological  analysis  of  liver. Liver  tissues  were  rap-
idly  dissected,  fixed  in  liquid  nitrogen  and  10%  formalin
solution, and stored  until use at -80oC. A representative part
of  the  frozen  tissues  was  processed  with  a  cryo  micro-
tome  (Cryotome  FSE  Cryostat;  Thermo  Electron  Corp.,
Cambridge,  MA,  USA)  using  sections  5-µm  thick  and
stained  with  oil  red-O  [13].  A  representative  part  of  the
formalin fixative liver tissues was processed for 4-µm thick
paraffin  embedded  sections  using  a  microtome  (Micro-
tome  HM  450;  Thermo  Electron  Corp.)  and  then  stained
with  hematoxylin  and  eosin.  Both  stained  tissue  samples
were  then  examined  and  photographed  under  a  light
microscope  to  assess  the  presence  of  lipid.  Digital  images
were obtained using an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped
with  a  Camedia  C3040ZOOM  digital  camera  (Olympus
America Inc., Melville, NY, USA). All images were taken
under 40× magnification.

Statistical  analysis. Results  are  expressed  as  means ±
SDs.  Intergroup  differences  were  analyzed  by  a  one-way
analysis  of  variance  followed  by  post-hoc  tests.  We  used
the  SPSS ver. 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  A  p ≤
0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results  and  Discussion

Effects  of  feeding  oyster  mushroom  on  bodyweight.
Feeding  P.  ostreatus  reduced  body  weight  significantly  in
hypercholesterolemic  and  normocholesterolemic  rats  by
16.89  and  13.38%,  respectively  (Table  2).  This  finding  is
of  special  significance  because  obesity  is  associated  with
many  diseases  including  diabetes,  atherosclerosis,  coro-
nary heart disease, and others [14].

VLDL-C,  TL,  and  PL  in  HC  rats  increased  by  17.09,

ters  decreased  significantly  by  30.18,  52.75,  19.91,  59.62,
27.08,  34.15,  and  23.89%,  respectively,  in  HC + PO  rats
compared  with  HC  rats.  The  ratio  of  plasma  LDL  and
HDL  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  In  HC  rats,  this  ratio  increased
by  11%,  compared  with  NC  rats,  whereas  this  ratio  was
reduced  significantly  by  50%  in  HC + PO  compared  with
HC  rats.  The  results  show  that  feeding  5%  P.  ostreatus  to
rats  significantly  ameliorated  the  plasma  atherogenic  lipid
profiles in experimentally induced HC rats.

Rats  are  particularly  resistant  to  the  development  of
hypercholesterolemia  and  atherosclerosis  [15]  and  have  a
strong  ability  to  maintain  their  plasma  cholesterol  levels
[16, 17]. Therefore, to induce hypercholesterolemia or ath-
erosclerosis  in  rats,  cholesterol  feeding  is  used  with  other
additives,  including  bile  acids  and  propylthiouracil  (an
anti-thyroid  drug),  which  increase  intestinal  absorption  of
cholesterol  [18].  However,  in  the  present  study,  the  addi-
tion  of  1%  cholesterol  to  the  basal  diet  without  bile  acids
and/or  anti-thyroid  drugs  produced  hypercholesterolemia
in the rats, because cholesterol feeding itself increases bile
acid  secretion  by  approximately  three  to  four-fold  in  rats
[19].  The  30.18%  increase  in  plasma  cholesterol  in  the

Thus,  feeding  mushrooms  may  involve  suppression  of
endogenous  cholesterol  biosynthesis  by  inhibiting  HMG-
CoA reductase activity.

Effects  of  feeding  oyster  mushroom  on  plasma  bio-
chemical  and  electrolyte  function. The  results  of  the
plasma  biochemical  and  electrolytes  concentrations  indi-
cated that albumin, uric acid, glucose, total protein, potas-
sium,  inorganic  phosphate,  and  magnesium  decreased
significantly  in  HC  rats  by  20.59,  70.83,  27.92,  19.18,
37.33,  40.52,  and  36.11%,  respectively,  compared  with
levels in oyster mushroom-fed rats. In contrast, no signifi-
cant difference was found for plasma total bilirubin, direct
bilirubin,  creatinin,  blood  urea  nitrogen,  calcium,  sodium,
and  chloride  levels  among  the  normocholesterolemic,  hy-
percholesterolemic,  and  oyster  mushroom-fed  HC  rats
(Table  4).  The  glucose-lowering  effect  of  propionate  is
associated  with  gluconeogenesis  and  the  regulation  of
serum  lipid  levels  [22].  Reduction  in  plasma  potassium,
sodium,  and  chloride  concentrations  is  one  of  the  mecha-
nisms of action of antihypertensive drugs, particularly diuret-
ics  [23].  Diuretics  act  by  diminishing  sodium  chloride
reabsorption  at  different  sites  in  the  nephrons,  thereby
increasing  urinary  sodium  chloride  and  water  losses  and
consequently  leading  to  decreased  plasma  levels  of  these
electrolytes. Antonov et al. [24] reported that plasma elec-
trolyte  contents  increased  significantly  in  hypertensive  rats.
Impaired  function  of  Na,  K-ATPase  and  the  Na-H  anti-
port,  which  is  typical  of  arterial  hypertension,  may  pro-
mote an increase in plasma electrolytes.

Effects of feeding oyster mushroom on plasma enzyme
profile. Lower  plasma  GOT,  GPT,  and  ALP  concentra-
tions were observed in oyster mushroom-fed HC rats than

HC  rats  in  the  present  study  was  comparable  with  that
reported  by  Bobek  et  al.  [20],  who  feed  rats  cholesterol
(0.3%)  diet  with  added  bile  acids  (0.5%)  and  showed  a
1.7-fold  higher  cholesterolemia  in  their  cholesterol-feed
rats  than  normal  rats.  In  this  experiment,  feeding  5%  P.
ostreatus to HC rats significantly repressed the increase in
plasma  cholesterol.  The  mechanism  by  which  mushrooms
reduce  plasma  lipoprotein  levels  in  HC  rats  is  not  clearly
understood.  Mushrooms  contain  the  hypocholesterolemic
agent  mevnolin  (monacolin  K,  lovastatin)  [21],  which  may
be  involved  in  decreasing  the  activity  of  the  3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme
[20],  the  rate-limiting  enzyme  of  cholesterol  biosynthesis.

normocholesterolemic rats (Table 5). No significant differ-
ence  was  observed  in  the  activities  of  plasma  ALP  in  the
NC,  HC,  or  HC + PO  rats  groups.  Plasma  GOT  and  GPT
activities  were  significantly  higher  in  HC  rats  than  in  NC
rats,  whereas  5%  HC + PO  rats  revealed  significantly
decreased  plasma  GOT  and  GPT  activities  by  13.60  and
11.28%, respectively.

Due  to  the  increasing  frequency  of  antihyperlipidemic
drug use and their common side effects, there is a need to
identify  natural  products  with  few  or  no  side  effects.  Thus,
development  continues  for  highly  effective  natural  ingre-
dients  from  food,  such  as  mushrooms,  which  decrease
hyperlipidemia  [3, 20].  Previous  studies  have  shown  that
GOT  and  GPT  are  typically  elevated  following  cellular
damage  as  a  result  of  enzyme  leakage  from  the  cells  into
blood  [25].  Therefore,  the  increased  enzyme  activities
resulting  from  oyster  mushroom  treatment  may  prevent
oxidative  damage  by  detoxifying  reactive  oxygen  species;
thus, reducing hyperlipidemia.

Effects  of  feeding  oyster  mushroom  on  fecal  TL  and
cholesterol. The  fecal  TL  and  cholesterol  of  the  5%  P.
ostreatus-fed  HC  rats  significantly  increased  by  2.7  and
3.2-fold,  respectively,  compared  with  NC  rats  (Table  6).

Thus,  the  decreased  plasma  cholesterol  may  have  attrib-
uted  to  such  a  mechanism.  The  higher  level  of  plasma
HDL-C  indicates  that  more  cholesterol  from  peripheral
tissues  was  returning  to  the  liver  for  catabolism  and  sub-
sequent  excretion.  Plasma  VLDL-C  and  TG  contents  in
HC + PO  rats  were  lower  compared  with  hypercholester-
olemic  control  rats.  VLDL-C  is  the  major  transport  vehi-
cle  for  TG  from  the  liver  to  extrahepatic  tissues,  whereas
LDL-C is not secreted as such in the liver but seems to be
formed  from  VLDL-C  after  partial  removal  of  TG  by
lipoprotein lipase [26]. LDL-C became the prime carrier for
cholesterol  after  feeding  cholesterol  to  the  rats,  leading  to
decreased VLDL-C and HDL-C content in HC + PO rats.

Effects  of  feeding  oyster  mushroom  on  the  plasma
lipoprotein fraction by agarose gel electrophoresis. The
α-lipoprotein  band  was  the  fast-moving  fraction  and  was
located  nearest  the  anode.  The  β-lipoprotein  band  was
usually  the  most  prominent  fraction  and  was  near  the  ori-
gin, migrating only slightly anodic to the point of applica-
tion.  The  pre-β  lipoprotein  band  migrated  between  the  α
and  β-lipoprotein  (Fig.  2).  The  effects  of  feeding  P.  ostrea-
tus on the plasma lipoprotein fraction are presented in Fig. 3.
The  results  indicated  no  significant  difference  in  the  lipo-
protein  fractions  between  NC  and  HC + PO  rats  and  HC
rats.  The  results  revealed  that  feeding  5%  oyster  mush-
rooms significantly reduced plasma β-lipoprotein  and  pre-

stained with hematoxylin-eosin and oil red O. The hepatic
cords  were  typically  arranged  and  located  in  liver  tissue
near the central  vein in the NC,  HC, and HC + PO groups.
Lipid  droplets  were  observed  only  in  the  liver  tissue  of
HC  rats.  This  could  be  attributed  to  lipid  accumulation  in
the  hepatocyte  cell  cytoplasm.  Oxidized  LDL  induces  the
expression of  scavenger  receptors  on the macrophage sur-
face.  These  scavenger  receptors  promote  the  accumula-
tion  of  modified  lipoproteins,  forming  an  early  atheroma.
The  histological  results  indicated  that  the  liver  tissues  of
5% HC + PO rats were almost similar to NC rats and that
the  hepatic  biosynthesis  of  cholesterol  was  suppressed,
which  might  be  due  to  a  reduction  in  the  activity  of
HMG-CoA  [28].  Hyperlipidemia  is  the  leading  risk  fac-
tor  for  atherosclerosis,  but  the  atherosclerotic  pathological
process  could  be  slowed  or  reversed  by  reducing  serum
LDL,  TGs,  and  PLs  and  increasing  serum  HDL.  Several
studies  have  demonstrated  a  protective  effect  of  HDL  in
atherosclerosis  and  cardiovascular  disease,  whereas  high
levels  of  LDL  constitute  a  risk  factor.  Excess  LDL  in  the
blood is deposited on the blood vessel walls and becomes a
major component of atherosclerotic plaque lesions, whereas
HDL  facilitates  translocation  of  cholesterol  from  periph-
eral  tissues,  such  as  arterial  walls,  to  the  liver  for  catabo-
lism  [29].  Bobek  and  Galbavý  [7]  observed  that  oyster
mushrooms prevented the formation of atheromatous plaques
and  reduced  the  incidence  and  extent  of  atherosclerotic
lesions  in  the  aorta  and  coronary  arteries  as  well  as  focal
fibrosis in the myocardium of rabbits.

The hypocholesterolemic  effect  of oyster  mushrooms  is
mediated  by  the  interplay  of  a  complex  mixture  of  sub-
stances [27]. Water-soluble gel-forming components of the
fiber  substance  (β-1,3-D-glucan  with  a  low  degree  of
polymerization,  forming  15~20%  of  dry  matter)  interacts
with  bile  acids  and  affects  micelle  formation.  Such  sub-
stances might be interfering with the absorption of choles-
terol in this manner.
