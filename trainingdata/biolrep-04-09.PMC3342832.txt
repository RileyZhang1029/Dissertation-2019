Abstract
During the adaptive immune response, lymphocytes undergo dramatic changes in metabolism that
accompany the proliferative burst and differentiation into functional subsets. This brief overview
focuses on recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of this metabolic reprogramming in
T lymphocytes.

Introduction
The adaptive immune response of vertebrates occurs
through clonal selection, an elegant process that involves
large numbers of lymphocytes. Each lymphocyte bears a
randomly generated receptor that, if bound by its ligand in
an appropriate context (indicative of potential infection),
stimulates the cell to proliferate, thereby generating many
more cells with this receptor. Because the specific cells are
pre-selected to remove those that might recognize “self”
components, the ligands that might engage the receptors
are “foreign” and, thus, may identify an invading organism
and orchestrate a response. The responding cells prolifer-
ate and functionally differentiate, and ultimately clear the
invader. The numbers of responding cells then decline,
ultimately leaving memory cells capable of a recall
response should the foreign ligands reappear.

The evolution of the adaptive immune response to many
pathogens is sometimes viewed as a sort of “arms race,”
since the invading organism may have the potential to
replicate much more rapidly than the lymphocytes that
would control it. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that
activated lymphocytes (B and T cells) have one of the
shortest cell cycles seen in mature vertebrate animals,
replicating every four to six hours [1]. However, this
proliferative burst is preceded by a lag phase of about
24 hours, during which the cell grows (increases mass)
prior to the first cell cycle entry. As we will see, this lag may

be essential for the proliferative burst and for subsequent
function of the clones, and the events surrounding these
changes represent an emerging area of intense interest.

Preparing T cell metabolism for proliferation
In shifting from a small, resting cell to a rapidly cycling
cell, a naïve lymphocyte effectively “reprograms” its meta-
bolism, changing from a cell that relies on fatty acid
oxidation (and some glycolysis), to one that engages
robust aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis [2] (see
Figure 1; here we focus on T lymphocytes, but similar
events may well occur in activated B lymphocytes). This
change relies on signaling events early in the activation
process. For example, a hierarchical signaling cascade
downstream of the cell surface receptors involved in
MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase)/ERK (extra-
cellular signal-regulated kinase), PI3K (phosphoinositide
3-kinase)/Akt, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)
kinase and NFkB (nuclear factor-kB) pathways rapidly
engages the expression of the transcription factor Myc,
which, in turn, induces the expression of transporters for
glucose and glutamine, and many of the enzymes involved
in glycolysis,
the pentose phosphate pathway, and
glutaminolysis [2,3]. This reprogramming, thereby, directs
nutrients to the production of nucleotides, lipids, amino
acids, and other biosynthetic products needed for
proliferation. Meanwhile, the activation of AKT and ERK
facilitates post-translational surface expression of glucose

Figure 1. Metabolic reprogramming in T lymphocytes

Following activation by recognition of antigen on antigen-presenting cells, T lymphocytes undergo metabolic reprogramming, shifting from FAO in the resting
T cells to robust glycolysis and glutaminolysis as they prepare to enter the cell cycle. The associated changes are orchestrated at the mRNA level by the
transcription factors Myc and ERRa. Activation of Akt and Erk facilitates post-translational surface expression of glucose transported Glut-1 and glutamine
transported SNAT2, respectively. As the cells proliferate they often differentiate into functional subtypes, including Treg, Th17, Th1 and Th2 cells. Such
differentiation can also involve changes in metabolism, for example by the actions of HIF1 and GCN2 in Th17 cells. In addition, cells that persist in the form of
memory T cells return to FAO to sustain energy, and this is inhibited by TORC1. Other events linking signaling to metabolism in T lymphocytes are outlined
in the text. Abbreviations: ERRa, estrogen-related receptor a; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; GCN2, general control nonrepressed 2; GLUT1, glucose

transporter Glut-1 and glutamine transporter SNAT2
(system A neutral amino acid transporter 2), respectively
[4,5]. However, AKT is dispensable for increased glycolysis
and proliferation in cytotoxic CD8 T cells; although these
effects depend on PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent
protein kinase-1), a well-known upstream regulator of
AKT [6]. TORC (TOR complex) 1, a downstream signaling
component of Akt, also plays a role in maintaining the
metabolic gene transcriptome in naïve quiescent T cells [7].
Meanwhile, the suppression of the nuclear receptor LXR
(liver X receptor) enhances cholesterol synthesis, an essen-
tial component of membranes [8], and the activation of an
orphan steroid receptor, ERRa (estrogen-related receptor a),
promotes lipid production, and perhaps mitochondrial
biogenesis [9]. Coordinately, these events most likely
prepare the activated T cells for their entry into their rapid
cell cycle.

T cell metabolism and differentiation
As T lymphocytes begin to proliferate they also undergo
differentiation into functional subsets in response to
extracellular signals, and these subsets determine the
nature of the immune response. CD4 T cells differentiate
into Th (T helper) 1 cells that mediate responses to intra-
cellular pathogens, Th2 cells that control responses to
extracellular bacteria and helminthes, Th17 cells that are
important in anti-fungal defense and inflammation, and
induced Treg (regulatory T) cells that dampen immune
responses. Of these, only the Treg cells rely on lipid
oxidation as an energy source, and forcing proliferating
T cells to utilize free fatty acids for energy tends to drive
enhanced Treg differentiation [10]. In contrast, increased
glycolysis is seen in differentiating Th17 cells, and this is
a function of the transcription factor HIF1 (hypoxia-
inducible factor 1) [10,11]. Thus, damping of glycolysis
with low dose 2-deoxyglucose inhibits Th17 and pro-
motes Treg generation [11]. HIF1 also directly enhances
RORgt activity and represses Foxp3 activity, producing a
reciprocal
increase in Th17 and decrease in iTreg
differentiation [12]. Meanwhile, the choice between Th1,
Th2 and Th17 differentiation is mediated in part by
TORC1/2, the activation of which requires a surplus of
intracellular amino acids pool; TORC1 promotes Th1 and
Th17 differentiation, while TORC2 promotes Th2 differ-
entiation [13]. In addition, the depletion of extracellular
amino acids, either by amino acid catabolic enzymes such
as IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase), Arg I (arginase I)
and asparaginase or by the small molecule halofuginone,
results in the activation of the protein kinase GCN2 (general
control nonrepressed 2) in T cells [14-17]. Consequently,
Th17 differentiation is suppressed, whereas Treg develop-
ment and T cell anergy are enhanced [14,18]. Each of these
regulatory “nodes” (HIF1, TORC, GCN2) are responsive to
metabolic status (e.g. oxygen availability, intracellular ATP

and amino acid pool), highlighting the connections
between metabolism and T cell signaling.

Following the peak of proliferation and differentiation,
there is a contraction phase as cells undergo apoptosis
dependent on the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM and PUMA
[19]. Cells destined to be memory T cells, responsible for
enhanced immunity upon rechallenge, persist by employ-
ing fatty acid oxidation, the activity of which is associated
with increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity and is
negatively regulated by TORC1 activity [20-22]. The inhi-
bition of TORC1 may require the function of the TSC
(tuberous sclerosis protein) 1/2 complex, as cells lacking
TSC1 do not generate immune memory [7].

Summary and future directions
We suspect that these studies merely “scratch the surface”
of metabolic control of lymphocyte function. And of
course,
the immune response is not restricted to
lymphocytes — the metabolic functions in cells of the
innate immune system, including macrophages, dendri-
tic cells, and others, are topics of ongoing investigation as
well. Further, while much current work is directed at
understanding how signaling pathways regulate meta-
bolic changes, there are intriguing observations in these
and other systems that support the converse; that is, that
changes in metabolic substrates and products directly
affect signaling. For example, the intracellular ATP and
amino acid pools directly impact the activities of AMPK
(AMP-activated protein kinase), TORC1 and GCN2 [14,
23, 24]. Further, enzymes in the metabolic pathways can
also function in signaling. For example, glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been impli-
cated in the control of gene expression [25], and the
glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2)
(expressed in cancers [26] and activated lymphocytes [2])
engages b-catenin signaling independently of Wnt [27].
We may intuit that these, and other critical enzymes, are
likely to link metabolic status to signaling.

A great deal of excitement has followed the metabolic
control of cancer in pointing the way to new therapies. The
same may well apply to metabolic control of dysregulated
autoimmune disease. These studies hold the promise for a
renaissance in nutritional research,
far beyond the
“immune diet” fads, based on fundamental principles of
the emerging connections between signaling pathways
and metabolism.
