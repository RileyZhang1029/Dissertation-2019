cues,
including diffusible chemical signals and
physical structural
information. In tis-
sues, conflicting gradients and signals
may require cells to not only respond to
the environment but also modulate it for
efficient adhesion formation and direc-
tional cell motility. Recently, we found
that cells endocytose fibronectin (FN)
and resecrete it from a late endosomal/
lysosomal (LE/Lys) compartment to pro-

cell motility.
Branched actin assembly regulated by
cortactin was required for trafficking of
FN-containing vesicles from LE/Lys to
the cell surface. These findings suggest
a model
in which migrating cells use
lysosomal secretion as a versatile mech-
anism to modulate the ECM environ-
ment, promote adhesion assembly and
enhance directional migration.

Cellular movement

factors and extracellular matrix (ECM).

edge

Branched actin assembly is required for
leading edge lamellipodial protrusion, the
first step in the cycle. However, actin
assembly is also critical for other cellular
functions, including cell-cell adhesion and
membrane trafficking, which could also
affect cell motility.2

to its presence

Many groups, including our own, have
studied the role of the branched actin
assembly protein cortactin in cell motility
in leading edge
due
lamellipodia and its potential
role in
cancer metastasis.3 Detailed live cell ana-
lyses have indicated that cortactin is not
required for lamellipodial protrusion but
does affect the stability or persistence of
lamellipodia after they are formed as well
as the assembly of adhesions at the leading
edge of migrating cells.4
Interestingly,
similar defects in lamellipodial persistence
as those exhibited by cortactin-knockdown
(KD) cells are found in cells with primary
in integrin levels or activity.5-8
defects
Those data suggested to us that perhaps
the lamellipodial persistence defects of
cortactin-KD cells are a secondary con-
sequence of adhesion assembly defects.

Cortactin Regulates Cell Motility
by Promoting Secretion of ECM

Because cortactin is known to regulate
membrane trafficking and exocytosis, we
hypothesized that cortactin might pro-
mote cell motility, adhesion assembly and
lamellipodial persistence as a direct con-
sequence of enhancing ECM secretion.
We began by determining whether cortac-
tin regulates extrinsic or intrinsic mechan-
isms of cell motility by measuring the
speed of cortactin-KD or overexpressing

various concentrations of ECM. Consis-
tent with an extrinsic motility defect,
cortactin-KD HT1080 human fibrosar-
coma cells migrated poorly on uncoated
surfaces but moved as rapidly as control
cells on surfaces coated with high concen-
trations of exogenous ECM (10 mg/ml FN
or 50 mg/ml Collagen I)-coated plates.
Cortactin-KD cell defects in lamellipodial
persistence and adhesion formation were
also rescued by plating cells on 10 mg/ml
FN. These findings suggested that cortac-
tin might indeed regulate cell motility by
promoting autocrine ECM secretion.

To directly test whether

autocrine
matrix from cortactin-expressing cells pro-
motes cell motility, cell-free ECM was
extracted from control, cortactin-KD and
cortactin-KD cells rescued by reexpression
of shRNA-insensitive wild-type cortactin
(Rescue). In two different cell types, cell-
free ECM extracted from control or
Rescue cells supported higher motility of
cortactin-KD cells
than cell-free ECM
extracted from cortactin-KD cells. Inter-
estingly, control and Rescue cells migrated
equivalently on control- and KD-produced
ECM, suggesting that cortactin-expressing
cells can dynamically secrete their own
matrix during motility. Immunofluores-
cent staining of FN in autocrine produced
cell-free ECM or deposited underneath
cells (visualized by total internal reflection
fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy) revealed
that
less FN deposition by
cortactin-KD cells. Consistent with a prim-
ary defect in membrane trafficking, cortactin
expression did not affect total cell levels of
FN mRNA or protein; however, cortactin-
KD cells exhibited a large accumulation of
FN in the perinuclear region, suggesting an
exit defect from a secretory compartment.

with Rab7 and LAMP1 and the size of the

control cells, suggesting a block in secretion
from a late endosomal/lysosomal (LE/Lys)
compartment.

equivalent

Since FN is abundant in serum used in
cell culture media9 and was highly coloca-
lized with late endosomes in our system,
we tested whether extracellular FN was
endocytosed and resecreted by cells to
promote cell motility. We removed FN
from the serum used in cell culture media
by affinity chromatography with gelatin-
sepharose.10 After culturing cells in media
containing the FN-depleted serum, we
found that
there was much less intra-
cellular FN accumulation and the motility
of all cortactin-manipulated cells (control,
KD and rescue) was
and
dampened. Furthermore,
confocal
and TIRF imaging using exogenously
provided fluorescently-labeled FN revealed
that
the exogenous FN is internalized,
contained in moving vesicles, and depos-
ited at the basal surface of control cells. In
cortactin-KD cells, FN was still interna-
lized, but TIRF imaging revealed that
there were fewer moving vesicles and less
fluorescent FN deposited at the base of
cells, consistent with the apparent traffick-
ing block from LE/Lys compartments.
KD of the lysosome-to-plasma membrane
fusion regulator, synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7)
also led to defective basal deposition of FN

that dynamic

Interestingly, although our work focused
on FN, studies on Laminin-5 and collagen
XVII in keratinocytes suggest that auto-
crine secretion of those ECM molecules
may also facilitate migration and lamelli-
podial stability.5,14,15 Thus, we speculate
that dynamic ECM secretion may be
utilized by a variety of migratory cell types
in diverse circumstances.

assembled into fibrils at the cell surface
before it can support cell adhesion.16-18
Fibril assembly is likely to be a fairly
slow process and may not occur at the
leading edge of cells. By contrast, already
assembled FN fibrils can be cleaved by
extracellular proteinases, internalized, and
resecreted in adhesive form from lyso-
somes to promote rapid adhesion assem-
bly. Furthermore,
lysosomal proteases
themselves are known to generate FN
that are highly adhesive,19,20
fragments
which could further allow conversion of

soluble internalized FN into an insoluble
ready-to-adhere form. According to this
model (Fig. 1), lysosomal secretion would
be a rapid way to provide adhesive forms
of FN and, if targeted to the leading edge,
could alter the directionality or speed of
migrating cells. One could also envision
that
targeted deposition of FN might
reinforce a nascent protrusion to create a
dominant lamellipodium and drive per-
sistent cell migration.

Although to our knowledge no previous
group has studied the role of lysosomal
secretion in ECM deposition, two prior

brane protein-7) was accompanied by a
reduction in the velocity of MDCK cells

lators,

Figure 1. A model of cell motility regulated by lysosomal secretion of ECM. In stationary cells, ECM is present in the environment in soluble non-adhesive
form or as fibrils. For cells to transition to a motile state, they must adopt a new morphology that could be facilitated or stabilized by rapid secretion of
adhesive forms of ECM. Thus, soluble ECM or proteolysed ECM fibrils could be internalized into lysosomes, cleaved into adhesive fragments by lysosomal
enzymes, and resecreted at the basal cell surface adjacent to the lamellipodium to promote cell motility.

Showell et al.23 identified a tight correla-
tive relationship between induction of
leukocyte chemotaxis and lysosome secre-
tion by N-formyl methionyl peptides
(correlation coefficient of 0.98 when
comparing the ED50s of 19 different
peptides in the two assays); the recent
findings from ourselves and others suggest
that this correlation may be mechanisti-
cally meaningful.

From recent work, lysosomal secretion
appears to be used by a variety of cell
types for cell motility and indeed other

phenotypes,13,21,22,24-28 not just by hemato-
poietic cells that are known to contain
specialized secretory granules of lysosomal
origin. For example, membrane resealing
in muscle cells and neurite outgrowth both
depend on lysosomal secretion, suggesting
that the classic description of lysosomes as
waste disposal compartments may under-
estimate their versatility and utility.

In conclusion, we have described a
novel mechanism by which the branched
actin assembly protein cortactin promotes
cell motility that involves lysosomal secre-
tion of ECM. Many fascinating questions
