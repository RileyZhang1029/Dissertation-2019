Sulfated polysaccharides (SP) such as heparin are known
to exhibit a wide range of biological activities, e.g., anti-
coagulant, anti-inﬂammatory, and antimetastastic effects.
However, since the anticoagulant activity of heparin is dom-
inating, its therapeutic use for other medical indications is
limited due to an associated risk of bleeding. Further disad-
vantages of heparin are its animal origin, the shortage of re-
sources, and its complex and variable composition. However,
SP without these limitations may represent a substance class
with good prospects for applications other than anticoagu-
lation. In this study, the in vitro pharmacological proﬁles of
two nonanimal-derived SP were investigated in comparison
with unfractionated heparin. One is the natural SP fraction
from the red algae Delesseria sanguinea (D.s.-SP). The other
one is the chemically deﬁned PS3, a semisynthetic β-1,3-
glucan sulfate with proven in vivo anti-inﬂammatory and
antimetastatic activities. All three polysaccharides were ex-
amined in vitro for their inhibitory effects on the coagulation
and complement system, polymorphonuclear neutrophil
elastase, hyaluronidase, matrix metalloproteinase-1, hep-
aranase, and P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion. Compared
with heparin, the nonanimal-derived polysaccharides have a
four times weaker anticoagulant activity, but mostly exhibit
stronger (1.4–224 times) effects on test systems investigating
targets of inﬂammation or metastasis. According to their
different structures, PS3 and D.s.-SP differ in their phar-
macological proﬁle with PS3 being the strongest inhibitor of
heparanase and cell adhesion and D.s.-SP being the strongest
inhibitor of hyaluronidase and complement activation. Con-
sidering both pharmacological proﬁle and pharmaceutical
quality parameters, PS3 represents a candidate for fur-
ther development as an anti-inﬂammatory or antimetastatic
drug whereas D.s.-SP might have perspectives for cosmetic
applications.

Introduction

Heparins still represent the drug of choice for prophylaxis and
therapy of
thromboembolic diseases. Their anticoagulant
activity is mainly based on the antithrombin-mediated inhi-
bition of FXa and thrombin. In addition, other antithrombin-
independent mechanisms like catalysis of heparin cofactor
II-mediated thrombin inhibition or release of the tissue fac-
tor pathway inhibitor contribute to their anticoagulant and an-
tithrombotic activities (Alban 2008b). Besides the inhibition
of coagulation, heparins exhibit many other biological activi-
ties which are involved in its overall therapeutic efﬁcacy. For
example, their well-known interferences with the complement
system contribute to the improved biocompatibility of heparin-
coated medical devices (Hsu 2001). Further, the survival ben-
eﬁt of tumor patients treated with low-molecular-weight hep-
arins (LMWH) observed in clinical studies currently attracts
attention (Akl et al. 2007; Lazo-Langner et al. 2007). The re-
duced mortality correlates with experimental animal data on
antimetastatic, antiangiogenic, and anti-inﬂammatory effects of
heparins (Smorenburg and van Noorden 2001; Lever and Page
2002; Ludwig et al. 2006; Norrby 2006). These are rather the
result of a concert of actions targeting the (patho)physiological
triad of hemostasis, inﬂammation, and metastasis than to be due
to a single mechanism (Alban 2008a). One of the mechanisms
currently discussed to be important (Buller et al. 2007) is the
inhibition of cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium, which
is initiated by selectins, and ﬁnally leads to the extravasation
of inﬂammatory and metastasizing tumor cells (Borsig 2004).
Another one is the inhibition of extracellular matrix-degrading
enzymes enabling these cells to migrate through tissues, to in-
vade into vessels, and to extravasate, and also supporting an-
giogenesis and tumor growth (McCachren 1991; Nelson et al.
2000; Parish et al. 2001; Girard et al. 2002; Posey et al. 2003;
Taggart et al. 2005; Sato et al. 2006; Vlodavsky et al. 2006).

However, the strong anticoagulant potency limits the appli-
cability for other therapeutic indications. A further disadvan-
tage of heparins is their animal origin for several reasons. First,
drug substances of animal origin should be avoided according
to the internationally implemented “precautionary principle”
(Alban 2005b). Second, heparin preparations vary considerably
depending on the source of raw material and extraction process.
Third, they have to be applied in units because of batch-to-batch
variability of the highly complex glycosaminoglycan mixtures
(Alban 2005a). Finally, the increasing demand for heparins is in
conﬂict with the limited resources. The relevance of the latter
has recently become manifested by the “heparin scandal” caused
by counterfeit heparin (Food and Drug Administration 2008).

Besides the vertebrate glycosaminoglycans (GAG), marine
organisms are rich sources for SP, such as carrageenans from

red algae or fucoidans from brown algae. A representative of
this class is the SP fraction isolated from the red algae De-
lesseria sanguinea (Hudson) Lamouroux (D.s.). D.s. turned out
to be the dominating algae of an artiﬁcial reef installed in the
Baltic Sea close to Nienhagen, Germany, several years ago. By
an optimized and standardized procedure, these D.s.-SP, con-
sisting of xylose-branched galactan sulfates, can be obtained in
a reproducible quality (Gr¨unewald et al., in preparation).

Such natural SP might be suitable as ingredients of cosmet-
ics or food supplements but not for the development of medi-
cal products because they would hardly meet the current high
requirements on pharmaceutical quality due to their complex
structure composition and biovariability. In contrast, chemi-
cally deﬁned synthetic or semisynthetic glycan sulfates may be
rather promising for the development of new drug substances.
A prominent example is fondaparinux, an approved antithrom-
botic drug. Another one is the β-1,3-glucan sulfate PS3 which
showed to have both anti-inﬂammatory (Yvin et al. 2002; Alban
et al. 2008) and antimetastatic effects on animal models (Alban
et al. 2005) without the disadvantages of heparins.

In the present study, we evaluated the pharmacological pro-
ﬁles of D.s.-SP and PS3 in comparison with unfractionated
heparin (UFH). Besides investigations of anticoagulant activ-
ity and cytotoxicity, inhibition of complement activation, in-
hibitory effects on extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading en-
zymes (polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase (PMNE), matrix
metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), hyaluronidase, and heparanase)
as well as inhibition of tumor cell adhesion to P-selectin are
presented.

Results

The pharmacological proﬁle of three SP – UFH, PS3, and D.s.-
SP – was determined. These three selected SP differ in their
origin as well as in their structural characteristics; UFH is a
glucosaminoglycan derived from porcine mucosa and D.s.-SP
is the non-gelling SP fraction isolated from the red algae D. san-
guinea consisting of sulfated xylogalactans. In contrast to these
two natural SP, PS3 is a well-deﬁned β-1,3-glucan sulfate, which
is produced by semisynthetic modiﬁcation of PhycarineTM from
Laminaria digitata (Table I). To estimate the anticoagulant,
anti-inﬂammatory, and antimetastatic potential of the test com-
pounds, corresponding in vitro test systems were established. As
far as synthetic or structurally deﬁned inhibitors of the examined
targets are known, these were included in the tests: GW311616A

as PMNE inhibitor, FN-439 as MMP-1 inhibitor, and escin as
hyaluronidase inhibitor.

Potential cytotoxic effects were checked with LDH (lactate
dehydrogenase) and MTT assays. According to the LDH assay,
no direct cytotoxic effects of UFH, PS3, or D.s.-SP on several
human tumor cell lines or leukocytes were found. As revealed
by the MTT assay, the test compounds did not inﬂuence tumor
cell proliferation (data not shown).

The results of the activities in the various assay systems are
presented as concentration-dependent curves (Figures 1–8) and
doubling concentration (DC – inhibitor concentration causing
a prolongation of the coagulation time to the 2-fold time of
the negative control) or IC50 values (Table II), respectively.
The ﬁnal assay concentrations of the SP are given in μg/mL.
Only in the case of the semisynthetic PS3, which consists of
a homogeneously sulfated β-1,3-glucan with an average degree
of polymerization of 25 and a low polydispersity, the indica-
tion of molar concentrations is acceptable. Thus, a comparison
with chemically deﬁned entities on a molar basis is possible
(Figures 4B, 5B, and 6B).

To evaluate the anticoagulant activity, two coagulation assays
were performed: the global activated partial thromboplastin time
(aPTT) detecting any inﬂuence on the intrinsic coagulation path-
way and the thrombin time (TT) measuring interferences with

the thrombin-mediated ﬁbrin formation. The DC values of PS3
and D.s.-SP were about four times higher than those of UFH re-
ﬂecting only moderate anticoagulant activity (Figures 1 and 2).
Further, anti-complementary activity was examined by means
of complement-induced hemolysis of antibody-sensitized ery-
throcytes with measurement of the released hemoglobin. All
three SP reduced the extent of hemolysis and thus represent in-
hibitors of the classical pathway of complement activation. But
compared with UFH, PS3 was 20 times and D.s.-SP even 224
times more potent (Figure 3).

To screen the inhibitory potency on ECM degradation, en-
zyme activity assays with two proteases, PMNE and MMP-1,
and two glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, hyaluronidase
and heparanase, were performed.

In the PMNE assay, the activity of the puriﬁed enzyme is de-
termined with a synthetic substrate in a buffered system. Here,
the equally active PS3 and D.s.-SP are signiﬁcantly but not much

410

stronger inhibitors than UFH exhibiting a 1.4 times higher activ-
ity (Figure 4A). Similarly, PS3 is 1.6 times more active than the
synthetic inhibitor GW311616A (Figure 4B). The superiority to
UFH was conﬁrmed by a ﬂuorimetric assay using FITC-labeled
elastin as a substrate (data not shown).

MMP-1 activity was examined in an assay based on the same
principle as the PMNE assay. While the synthetic inhibitor FN-
439 reveals inhibitions of up to 90% with an IC50 of 5.69 ±
0.17 μmol/L (Figure 5B, Table II), the SP UFH, PS3, and
D.s.-SP show only low maximal inhibitions of less than 50%
(Figure 5A) and higher interassay variations.

For the determination of inhibitory effects on hyaluronidase,
the cleavage of its natural substrate hyaluronic acid was quanti-
ﬁed by converting the resulting fragments into colored products.
While the potency of PS3 does not signiﬁcantly differ from that
of UFH, D.s.-SP is a 3.3 times stronger inhibitor than UFH
(Figure 6A, Table II). According to the observed superiority
of PS3 to escin (Figure 6B), the investigated SP represent by
several orders of magnitude stronger hyaluronidase inhibitors.

In the heparanase assay, PS3 and D.s.-SP cannot be compared
with UFH since the latter both inhibits the enzyme and repre-
sents a substrate. Consequently, no valid inhibition data for UFH
can be obtained. Inversely to the activity against hyaluronidase,
PS3 is a stronger heparanase inhibitor than D.s.-SP (Figure 7).
As a simple screening method to assess inﬂuences on cell
adhesion to P-selectin, a static microplate assay was used. Again,
both PS3 and D.s.-SP exhibit stronger inhibitory effects than
UFH with PS3 being even stronger than D.s-SP (Figure 8).

As obvious from Figure 9, each of the tested SP has an in-
dividual pharmacological proﬁle. In that of UFH, the anticoag-
ulant activity clearly dominates. This is known to be mediated
by 30–50% of its molecules containing the speciﬁc pentasac-
charide sequence (Mulloy 2005; Alban 2008a) which binds
to antithrombin and thus catalyzes the inhibition of thrombin
and factor Xa. According to a chromogenic substrate assay on
the antithrombin-mediated inhibition of factor Xa, neither D.s.-
SP nor PS3 have any antithrombin-mediated activity (data not
shown), which explains their moderate anticoagulant activity.
But concerning the other activities, they represent generally
more or less stronger inhibitors than UFH. D.s.-SP, which has
a relatively low degree of sulfation (DS), but a high molecular
weight (Mr), impresses by its inhibitory activity on complement
activation and hyaluronidase whereas PS3, the SP with the high-

Discussion

In this study, several screening assays were performed to eval-
uate the potential of PS3 and D.s.-SP as new compounds
with anti-inﬂammatory and antimetastatic activities. The results

suggest that these two SP exhibit a wide range of biological
activities like heparins do (Alban 2008b). However, compared
to UFH, their pharmacological proﬁle is clearly shifted in fa-
vor of effects that are considered to be important for in vivo
anti-inﬂammatory and antimetastatic activities.

In this way, our ﬁndings exemplarily demonstrate that the
activities of SP are not based on unspeciﬁc electrostatic inter-
actions with positively charged proteins, but depend on their
individual structure. They conﬁrm studies on structure–activity
relationships of structurally deﬁned semisynthetic glucan sul-
fates. The latter revealed that important factors for their phar-
macological activities are charge density, chain length, as well
as the sulfation pattern and the basic polysaccharide structure
(Alban and Franz 1994, 2001; Becker et al. 2003; Fritzsche et al.
2006). Depending on the target, different structural aspects are
decisive for the inhibitory potency. Whereas the anticoagulant
and PMNE inhibiting activity depend on both DS and Mr, for
inhibition of complement activation and hyaluronidase, a high
Mr is more important than a high DS. Inversely, to inhibit hep-
aranase, a high DS seems to be more important than high Mr
as PS3 is much more potent than D.s.-SP, and also the highly

sulfated oligosaccharide mixture PI-88 is a very potent inhibitor
of heparanase (Parish et al. 2001).

In addition, sometimes other structural characteristics than
Mr and DS are crucial for the activity. For example, the anti-
coagulant activity of heparin is caused by the interaction with
antithrombin via a speciﬁc pentasaccharide sequence. Further,
the anticoagulant activity of D.s.-SP was superior to that of a
κ-carrageenan with similar DS and Mr (data not shown). This
could be due to the branched structure of D.s.-SP (Gr¨unewald
et al., in preparation) since branched glucan sulfates showed
to be stronger anticoagulants than linear ones with similar DS
and Mr (Alban and Franz 1994). Concerning PMNE inhibition,
the β-1,3-glucan sulfate PS3 was found to be a more potent in-
hibitor than pentosan polysulfate (PPS), although this sulfated
glucuronoxylan has similar Mr and DS (Becker et al. 2003).

These observations agree with the description of cell-surface
heparan sulfates as structures speciﬁcally interacting with
their numerous binding partners by exposing distinct three-
dimensional patterns of sulfate substitution (Lindahl et al. 1998;
Mulloy 2005). Analogously, heparins and SP, which are struc-
turally related to heparan sulfate, may – in dependence on their
individual structure – interfere more or less with processes,
where the GAG heparan sulfate or other glycan structures are
involved (Alban 2008b). Heparan sulfate shows pronounced
structural diversity and has manifold regulatory functions by
interactions with a large number of biomolecules such as

enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, growth factors, extracellular ma-
trix proteins, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and receptor pro-
teins (Lindahl et al. 1998). In addition, also other GAG and
negatively charged glycan structures such as mucins binding to
P- and L-selectin are involved in cell–cell and cell–matrix inter-
actions (McEver 1997). This may partly explain why heparins
and SP do not principally display only one speciﬁc activity, but
rather act as multivalent biomodulators. In this study, we found
that PS3 not only inhibits the P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion,
but also represents a potent heparanase and elastase inhibitor.
Although extensive mechanistic studies including experiments
with knock-out mice support the relevance of antagonization
of P-selectin (Alban et al. 2008), the in vivo anti-inﬂammatory
activity may not only be based on this effect.

Another

reason for

the multiple activities of heparins
and SP is that hemostasis, immune system, and tumor pro-
gression including metastasis and angiogenesis represent a
(patho)physiological network (Altieri 1995; Coussens and Werb
2002; Opal and Esmon 2003; Bierhaus and Nawroth 2005;
Polgar et al. 2005; Rak et al. 2006; Buller et al. 2007). They
are closely connected by mechanisms which play a role in sev-
eral of these processes. This can be exempliﬁed by most targets
investigated in this study. The ECM-degrading enzymes PMNE,
MMP-1, hyaluronidase, and heparanase are expressed by both
inﬂammatory and tumor cells (McCachren 1991; Nelson et al.
2000; Parish et al. 2001; Girard et al. 2002; Posey et al. 2003;
Taggart et al. 2005; Sato et al. 2006; Vlodavsky et al. 2006).
They thus enable these cells to pass basal membranes and/or to
migrate through tissues. This is essential for inﬂammatory cells
to extravasate and reach the center of inﬂammation, but is also
important for tumor growth and metastasis. P-Selectin, which is
expressed by activated endothelial cells and platelets, mediates
the rolling of inﬂammatory cells and thus initiates their extrava-
sation. In addition, it has been recognized to be involved in tumor
metastasis (Borsig 2004) as well as in hemostasis and vascular
pathologies (Andr´e 2004). The complement system, an impor-
tant part of the innate immune defense, has strong inﬂuences
on inﬂammatory processes but also enhances coagulation by
activation of platelets, increasing of tissue factor expression in
several cell types, etc. which often contributes to life-threatening
complications during inﬂammatory diseases (Markiewski et al.
2007). Interference with any step within this network may there-
fore be beneﬁcial for the therapy of numerous diseases.

Although this study focuses on effects in simple in vitro as-
says, the proven in vivo activities of heparin (Smorenburg and
van Noorden 2001; Lever and Page 2002; Ludwig et al. 2006;
Akl et al. 2007; Lazo-Langner et al. 2007) and PS3 (Yvin et al.
2002; Alban et al. 2005, 2008) strengthen the signiﬁcance of
our observations and support the hypothesis that both PS3 and
D.s.-SP may have better anti-inﬂammatory and antimetastatic
activities in vivo than heparin. However, there are big differ-
ences between the two test compounds. This concerns not only
their structural characteristics and their pharmacological proﬁle,
but also their origin and consequently the options for potential
applications.

D.s.-SP is a natural product like heparins, fucoidans iso-
lated from brown algae (Berteau and Mulloy 2003), or other
biologically active algae polysaccharides such as sulfated glu-
curonogalactans (SGG) isolated from the red alga Schizymenia
dubyi. The latter were shown to have in vitro effects against
several viruses, to inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC-N6 tumor

Pharmacological proﬁles of sulfated polysaccharides

cells and to exhibit anticoagulant and anticomplementary activ-
ities (Bourgougnon et al. 1994; Alban et al. 1997). However,
the SGG revealed high batch-to-batch variability in both struc-
tural parameters and pharmacological activities (Bourgougnon
et al. 1996). Also fucoidans vary in both their structural com-
position and their pharmacological proﬁle depending on their
origin (Cumashi et al. 2007). Variability represents a common
problem of complex structured SP from natural origin, and is,
e.g., the cause why heparins have to be applied in International
Units based on their in vitro anticoagulant activity instead of
milligrams in clinical practice. It might also be one of the
reasons that so far fucoidans have not been tested in clinical
studies despite numerous promising pharmacological activities
such as anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects as well as anti-
inﬂammatory, antiproliferative, antiadhesive, and antiviral ones
(Berteau and Mulloy 2003; Mour˜ao 2004).

Although for the production of D.s.-SP only algae from a
certain artiﬁcial reef are used and D.s.-SP can be obtained in
reproducible quality by a speciﬁc extraction procedure, it is as-
sumed to be not suitable for drug development, but may be a
candidate with good prospects for other applications. Already
in 1987, a patent was ﬁled on an emulsion containing 1–5%
of an aqueous extract of D. sanguinea, which has been sup-
posed to improve peripheral blood circulation and to relieve
vein complaints (Herve et al. 1987). Recently, a cosmetic com-
position for the treatment and prevention of skin stretch marks
was patented, which contains – among other components – an
extract of D. sanguinea (Montanari and Guglielmo 2008). Ex-
cept for the anticoagulant activity of extracts from D. sanguinea
(Potin et al. 1992), so far no further pharmacological properties
are however known justifying these applications. In this study,
we identiﬁed some effects of D.s.-SP, i.e., a major component
of the extracts, which support the intended use. The inhibition
of ECM-degrading enzymes and especially hyaluronidase may
suit the claimed purposes by reduction of vascular permeabil-
ity. Interestingly, D.s.-SP turned out to be considerably more
active than escin, a known hyaluronidase inhibitor (Facino et al.
1995). Escin is the active ingredient in horse chestnut seed ex-
tract, which has been acknowledged as an efﬁcacious treatment
for chronic venous insufﬁciency (Pittler and Ernst 2006)

In contrast to D.s.-SP, PS3 is a structurally well-deﬁned
semisynthetic SP, which is produced according to the good
manufacturing practice (GMP) guidelines. It can be compared
with PPS and PI-88 as examples for other semisynthetic sul-
fated poly- or oligosaccharides, respectively, and accordingly
represents a promising candidate for drug development. PPS
is obtained by sulfation of glucuronoxylans extracted from the
bark of Fagus sylvatica. It has been licensed by the FDA for
the treatment of interstitial cystitis. Like PS3, PPS has man-
ifold activities which may contribute to its therapeutic efﬁ-
cacy in this indication (Anderson and Perry 2006). In Ger-
many, it is approved for oral supporting treatment of periph-
eral arterial disease, for parenteral postoperative prophylaxis
of thromboembolism, and for topic application in diseases
like superﬁcial thrombophlebitis. Compared to PPS, the ad-
vantage of PS3 is its more homogenous composition and its
lower polydispersity. PI-88 is obtained by hydrolysis and sulfa-
tion of yeast-derived phosphomannan (Khachigian and Parish
2004). It has strong inhibitory potency toward heparanase
(Parish et al. 2001) and is being developed as an antiangio-
genic anticancer agent (Ferro et al. 2007) with approved clinical

413

I Groth et al.

effects (Lewis et al. 2008). PPS and PI-88 exemplify the poten-
tial of semisynthetic SP like PS3 to be successfully introduced as
drugs.

Examinations of structurally deﬁned SP in a wide range
of in vitro assays together with studies on structure–activity
relationships and in vivo experiments may help to identify
those modes of action which are most important for the in vivo
anti-inﬂammatory and/or antimetastatic activity of heparins and
other SP.

Our results suggest that PS3 would be worth being examined
in clinical studies as an anti-inﬂammatory and/or antimetastatic
agent. It resulted as the most promising candidate from extensive
structure–activity relationship studies, has been shown to be
active in vivo, is produced under GMP-conditions, and already
passed preclinical toxicological tests. But also for D.s.-SP, there
might be a perspective of application in cosmetics as an anti-
inﬂammatory agent with potential anti-ageing effects due to
inhibition of ECM-degrading enzymes.

Material and methods

Test compounds
Unfractionated heparin (UFH) from porcine mucosal origin
(Lot-No 73508019, a purity of ≥99% has been veriﬁed by the
certiﬁcate of analysis by Biochemie GmbH Kundl, Austria) was
a kind gift from Novartis (N¨urnberg, Germany). PS3, a linear
β-1,3-glucan sulfate with the in vivo anti-inﬂammatory activity
(US Patent No. US7008931-B2, Mr = 10 kDa, produced under
GMP conditions, purity ≥ 99%), was synthesized as previously
described (Yvin et al. 2002; Alban et al. 2008). The source
of the sulfated polysaccharide fraction D.s.-SP was the red al-
gae D. sanguinea (Hudson) Lamouroux harvested in June 2006
from an artiﬁcial reef situated in the Baltic Sea (Nienhagen,
Germany). D.s.-SP was isolated following a standard procedure
(purity ≥ 95%) (Gr¨unewald et al., in preparation). Important
characteristics of these test compounds are shown in Table I.
As reference substances, the synthetic enzyme inhibitors
GW311616A (Mr = 433.99) for PMNE (Sigma, Taufkirchen,
Germany), FN-439 (Mr = 490.6) for MMP-1 (Calbiochem,
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), and escin (Mr = 1101.23)
for hyaluronidase (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) were
examined.

Materials
Microplates were obtained from Nunc (Wiesbaden, Ger-
many). Coagulation assays were performed using the Amelung-
coagulometer KC10 macro (Lemgo, Germany), microplates in
ﬂuorescence or absorbance assays were read out by the mi-
croplate reader Polarstar Optima, BMG Labtech, Jena.

LDH-assay
For the detection of any cytotoxicity, the lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) kit from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany) was
performed using the tumor cell lines U-937, MONO-MAC-6,
and LS-180 as well as with monocytes and polymorphonuclear
neutrophils freshly isolated from human blood following the
recommended procedure.

MTT assay
This test was performed with the tumor cell lines U-937,
MONO-MAC-6, and LS-180 as described by Lindl (2002).
Cells were adjusted to a concentration of 105 cells/mL. Hun-
dred milliliters of this cell suspension was mixed with 100
μL of different concentrations of the test substance in a mi-
◦
C (5% CO2) for 24 h, 20 μL of
croplate. After incubation at 37
sterile MTT solution (MTT = 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide, solved in PBS at 5 mg/mL) per
◦
well was added. During further 2 h of incubation at 37
C (5%
CO2), a blue product emerges. The microplate was centrifuged
(250 × g, 5 min), the supernatant removed, and 100 μL of lysis
mixture (consisting of 99.4 mL DMSO, 0.6 mL glacial acetic
acid, 10 g SDS) was pipetted into each well. After 5 min of
incubation at room temperature and 5 min of thorough mixing,
the optical density at 570 nm was measured.

(0.025 mol/L, Dade Behring) was added. The time until ﬁbrin
clot formation was recorded, and the “doubling concentration”
(inhibitor concentration causing a prolongation of the coagula-
tion time to the 2-fold time of the negative control) was deter-
mined. NaCl 0.9% without inhibitor served as negative control;
UFH was used as reference substance.

Further, the speciﬁc activities (IU/mg) of the test compounds
were determined according to the European Pharmacopoeia 6.0
by means of a calibration curve of the “5th International Stan-
dard for Unfractionated Heparin” (NIBSC code: 97/578).

Elastase inhibition assay
For the inhibition assay, human PMNE (EC 3.4.21.37) from
Calbiochem (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was used.
Tests were performed in black 96-well microplates. An aliquot
of 25 μL of Tris buffer (50 mM Tris, 155 mM NaCl, pH 8.3) was
mixed with 25 μL of inhibitor (diluted in NaCl 0.9%) and 25 μL
of PMNE (c = 100 nM) in Na acetate buffer (50 mM Na acetate,
200 mM NaCl, 1% BSA, pH 5.5). After 5 min of incubation at
◦
C, 25 μL of substrate solution (MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-7-
37
amido-4-methylcoumarin, Bachem [Weil am Rhein, Germany]),
diluted in Tris buffer (c = 3 mM), was added. Fluorescence was
◦
measured after 5 min incubation time at 37
C at excitation (Ex)

370 nm, emission (Em) 450 nm. The ﬂuorescence values from
blanks were subtracted from all other values. The resulting val-
ues were used to determine the concentration-dependent inhibi-
tion (%) in relation to the positive control (100%). The synthetic
inhibitor GW311616A was used as reference substance.

Hyaluronidase inhibition assay
Tests were performed in 96-well microplates. For the enzyme
reaction, 25 μL of phosphate buffer (pH 5.0), 25 μL of inhibitor
in 0.9% NaCl, 25 μL hyaluronic acid in water (4 mg/mL), and
25 μL bovine hyaluronidase (80 U/mL)
from Sigma
(Taufkirchen, Germany) (EC 3.2.1.35) were incubated for 120
◦
min at 37
C. To cleave the terminal N-GlcNAc units from
the resulting hyaluronan oligosaccharides, 10 μL of K2B4O7
buffer (pH 10.0) were added, and the covered microplate was
◦
C. After cooling, 170 μL of 4-
incubated for 30 min at 105
dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (2%) was added, followed by in-
◦
cubation for 30 min at 40
C (Morgan–Elson reaction). The
OD at 570 nm was measured versus an enzyme-free blank.
The absorbance values from blanks were subtracted from all
other values. The resulting values were used to determine the
concentration-dependent inhibition (%) in relation to the posi-
tive control (100%). Escin was used as reference substance.

MMP-1 inhibition assay
For the inhibition assay, recombinant human MMP-1 (EC
3.4.24.7) (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) was used. For
◦
activation of MMP-1, it was incubated for 3 h at 37
C with
the 1 mM p-aminophenylmercuric acetate solution (Sigma,
Taufkirchen, Germany). Enzyme inhibition tests were per-
formed in black 96-well microplates. An aliquot of 25 μL
of Tris buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2,
0.05% Brij 35, pH 7.5) was mixed with 25 μL of inhibitor
(diluted in NaCl 0.9%) and 25 μL of activated MMP-1 (c =
◦
0.5 μg/mL in Tris buffer). After incubation for 5 min at 37
C,
25 μL of substrate solution (ES001 = Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-
Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2, c = 20 μM in Tris buffer, R&D Systems)
◦
was added. After another incubation time of 60 min at 37
C,
ﬂuorescence intensity was measured at Ex 320 nm, Em 405
nm. The ﬂuorescence values from blanks were subtracted from
all other values. The resulting values were used to determine
the concentration-dependent inhibition (%) in relation to the
positive control (100%). The synthetic inhibitor 4-Abz-Gly-
Pro-D-Leu-D-Ala-NHOH (FN-439, Calbiochem, Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany) was used as reference substance.

Hemolytic complement modulation assay
An aliquot of 75 μL of inhibitor dilution in the veronal buffer
(Virion Serion, W¨urzburg, Germany) was mixed with 50 μL
of antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (Virion-Serion) and
25 μL of a dilution of human pooled serum in a V-microplate.

P-Selectin binding assay
This test was performed with the monocytic cell line U937. Mi-
croplates (MaxisorpTM) were coated with 50 μL P-selectin (hu-
man, recombinant, R&D-Systems) in PBS without Ca2+
/Mg2+
(c = 3 μg/mL) for 1 h. After blocking with BSA 1% in PBS
/Mg2+
without Ca2+
for 1 h, microplates were washed with PBS
/Mg2+
without Ca2+
. Then, 100 μL of inhibitor in PBS without
was added followed by centrifugation (250 × g,
Ca2+
/Mg2+
◦
2 min, 20
C) and an incubation time of 10 min at room temper-
ature (RT). The addition of 100 μL of cell suspension (c = 0.5
× 106 cells/mL in RPMI without phenol red) was followed by
◦
another incubation time of 10 min at 37
C. Unbound cells and
buffer were removed, and microplates were washed twice with
PBS without Ca2+
. The cells which bound to P-selectin
were quantiﬁed by the addition of 50 μL Triton X-100 so-
lution 0.2% and subsequent detection of released LDH with
the Cytotoxicity Kit R(cid:2)
from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim,
Germany).

Statistical analysis
All liquid assay measurements were done in duplicate and re-
peated at least three times on different days (n ≥ 6); cell assay
measurements were done in triplicate and repeated at least three
times as well (n ≥ 9). All data are presented as mean ± standard
deviation (SD) of the mean from n experiments. For determi-
nation of doubling concentrations and IC50 values, data were
analyzed by nonlinear curve ﬁtting using the program Sigma
Plot 8.0. IC50 values were determined for each experiment
(n > = 6), resulting in the indicated mean values ± SD. Sta-
tistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test; P ≤ 0.05
was considered as statistically signiﬁcant.
