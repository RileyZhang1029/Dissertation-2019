Abstract
Certain forms of inflammation of an allograft are highly detrimental to the induction and maintenance
of transplant tolerance as they foster stable commitment to graft-destructive, not graft-protective,
forms of T-cell immunity. Hence, a reduction in adverse tissue inflammation may prove crucial in
facilitating the induction and maintenance of a long-lasting state of transplant tolerance.

Introduction and context
Upon activation by donor alloantigens, recipient naive T
cells can differentiate into a variety of graft-destructive,
effector T cell or graft-protective, regulatory T cell (Treg)
phenotypes. These T-cell commitments are determined
largely by the texture of the innate immune milieu in
which T-cell activation occurs. Both cytokines and
Toll-like receptor agonists are of great importance. A
milieu in which transforming growth factor b1 (TGFb1) is
expressed in the absence of proinflammatory cytokines
promotes the commitment of alloactivated T cells into a
tissue-protective, forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)+ Treg pheno-
type. In contrast, a milieu in which proinflammatory
cytokines are abundant prevents the generation of
Foxp3+ Tregs and instead directs T-cell commitment into
the tissue-destructive T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, or Th17
phenotypes [1-4]. Unfortunately, a robust expression of
proinflammatory cytokines is typical
recently
engrafted organ transplants. The inflamed state, highly
detrimental to the Treg induction and immunoregulatory
function [1,3,5], is a consequence of innate immune
activation in response to the ischemia and reperfusion
injury [5,6]. Although conventionally used agents such as
corticosteroids are perhaps useful in restricting the early
graft inflammation [7-9], their broad immunosuppressive
action, including blocking the expression of TGFb1, does
not facilitate tolerance [10,11]. Hence, we believe that

for

reducing the adverse forms of inflammation but allowing
activity of TGFb1 and other inhibitory cytokines within a
graft may prove to be a key approach for the induction
and maintenance of allograft tolerance. We suspect that
the creation of an intra- and peri-graft milieu devoid of
proinflammatory cytokines will serve to guide the
majority of donor-activated T cells into a TGFb1-incited,
Treg tissue-protective phenotype. Indeed, our own results
and the results of others support this concept [12-15].
Therapies that primarily block adverse inflammation,
such as alpha1-antitrypsin, anti-interleukin (IL)-6, or
anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha, have been successfully
utilized by our group in tilting the balance of the allograft
response toward tolerance, or in restoring tolerance in
the non-obese diabetic (NOD) model of type 1 diabetes,
even in NOD mice with frank diabetes [14,15]. Given
the availability of therapies (many of them approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration) that are
suitable for blocking the adverse forms of inflammation,
rapid translation into the clinic seems possible for the
treatment of certain immune-inflammatory disorders.
We are aware that a pure prevention or a blockade of
inflammation may not be sufficient to achieve lasting
transplant tolerance in humans. Additional lymphocyte-
depleting measures are required first of all in order to
prevent rejection in pre-sensitized recipients [16]. None-
theless, we believe that favorably tipping the balance of

pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the milieu in
which non-depleted T cells re-populate will foster T-cell
commitment into a tissue-protective mode and promote
tolerance. Our current efforts at blocking TIM4 (T-cell
immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing
protein 4), a molecule upregulated by antigen-presenting
cells exposed to proinflammatory cytokines and Toll-like
receptor agonists [17,18], have proven equally successful in
promoting long-term engraftment in preclinical models of
transplantation and autoimmunity, although this method
is not yet ready for testing in humans. If confirmed that
TIM4 blockade leaves T-cell anti-viral responses largely
intact, it may be an especially attractive strategy to promote
tolerance in patients with chronic viral infections. Collec-
tively, our own studies and the studies of others establish

‘adverse’ inflammation as a key therapeutic target in the
quest for transplant tolerance.

transplant

Major recent advances
Induction and maintenance of
tolerance
require that graft-protective Foxp3+ Tregs efficiently and
durably restrain the pool of graft-destructive effector
T cells after anti-rejection therapy is withdrawn [19]
(Figure 1). For tolerance to be permanent, the Foxp3-
dependent Treg immunoregulatory phenotype must be
stabilized. Why? A stable expression of Foxp3, the Treg
lineage specification transcription factor, is required to
maintain Treg function and thereby maintain transplant
tolerance [20,21]. Loss of Foxp3 gene expression, such as
that occurring in the inflamed, IL-6-rich environments,

can destabilize Treg molecular phenotype and immuno-
regulatory function, thereby undermining the mainte-
nance of transplant tolerance [22,23]. With the loss of
immunoregulatory function among these destabilized
Tregs, rejection occurs as the immunoregulatory restraints
upon donor-reactive effector T cells are released.

How is Foxp3 expression stabilized? Foxp3 expression
in Tregs is regulated, in part, by epigenetic modifications
of the Foxp3 chromosomal locus [24]. The methylation
status of CpG-sensitive residues upstream of the tran-
scriptional start site (Exon1) is an important regulator
of Foxp3 expression. Methylation of
these residues
represses Foxp3 gene expression while complete
demethylation is required for optimal Foxp3 gene
expression [25,26]. Other epigenetic mechanisms, such
as histone methylation and acetylation, also modulate
Foxp3 stability [26,27]. Of note,
therapeutic agents
that directly foster maintenance of demethylated
Foxp3 promote robust expression of Foxp3-sensitive
genes, immunoregulatory T-cell function, and tolerance
[26,28]. For this purpose, some inhibitors of DNA
methyltransferases, such as nucleoside analog 5-azacyti-
dine, have been successfully used in experimental studies
[28]. Perhaps owing to the known toxicity of demethy-
lating agents, formal clinical trials in transplantation
have not yet been undertaken. Why are these observa-
tions potentially important for clinical application? That
Treg infusions have the potential to prolong allograft
survival and induce transplant
tolerance is widely
acknowledged [29]. However, the clinical use of Tregs
for the adoptive transfer into transplant recipients is
hindered by the inherent
the Foxp3-
dependent Treg phenotype upon exposure of Tregs to
inflamed environments. As noted, in the proinflamma-
tory milieu, Foxp3 expression is diminished, inhibitory
function is compromised, and some Tregs even convert
to T effector-like phenotypes [22,30-32]. Such Treg
instability has been associated with the activation of
DNA methyltransferases and the consequent remethyla-
tion of CpG residues [26]. It therefore seems intuitive
that therapeutic strategies able to maintain Foxp3 in a
demethylated state may be essential for the effective
application of Treg therapy in the clinic. While inhibitors
of DNA methyltransferases and of histone deacetylase
are not without toxicity, the addition of safe agents that
synergize or supplant these drugs as a means to regulate
epigenetic expression of Foxp3 should prove extremely
valuable in the long-standing quest to induce tolerance.

instability of

Tregs and conventional effector T cells take important
cues from their microenvironment, which influences their
commitment
into regulatory or effector phenotypes.
Among extracellular stimuli, IL-2-triggered expression of

STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5)
likely plays a major role in stabilizing Tregs [33]. STAT5,
activated downstream of IL-2 receptor complex signaling,
binds to the promoter region of the Foxp3 gene and
thereby activates its transcription [34]. By enhancing
transcription of Foxp3, the STAT5 pathway serves to
maintain a stable Treg phenotype. We and others have
utilized IL-2, IL-2 anti-IL-2 complexes, or IL-2.Ig either
alone or in conjunction with rapamycin and other agents
to promote tolerance induction [14,35,36]. Such therapies
have successfully induced transplant tolerance or restored
self-tolerance in the NOD model of type 1 diabetes. In
addition to activating the STAT5 pathway and expression
of Foxp3, IL-2 signal, if delivered by a long-lived IL-2
anti-IL-2 complex or IL-2.Ig, also causes apoptosis of
repeatedly activated effector (but not regulatory) T cells
[37]. The fact that calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclos-
porin negatively impact Treg function and activation-
related effector T-cell apoptosis [19] may indeed be a
result of suppressed IL-2 signals. We have previously
shown that cyclosporin does prevent tolerance induced
by co-stimulation blockade in a cardiac transplant
model. Rapamycin, on the other hand, did not impede
the induction of such achieved tolerance and, as we
showed later, does promote the generation of induced
Tregs [38,39]. The imbalance of tissue-protective Tregs
and tissue-destructive Th17 cells was recently implicated
in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and certain types of
rejection [1]. Of note, the commitment of naive T cells to
the Th17 phenotype (a subset with aggressive cytodes-
tructive properties) is inhibited by IL-2, and the expression
of STAT5 negatively regulates Th17 cells [40]. It
is
therefore reasonable to posit that the activation of the
IL-2/STAT5 pathway promotes tolerance by favorably
tilting the balance between Th17 cells and Tregs toward
Treg dominance.

Future directions
Strategies used to obtain transplant
tolerance have
primarily targeted T cells. These strategies have centered
upon attempts to delete or at least deplete donor-reactive
T cells or alter the early events of T-cell activation such as
through co-stimulation blockade. The notion that graft
inflammation is the major impediment to transplant
tolerance prompts us to further investigate the means
of its most efficient therapeutic targeting. It may not
be possible to create transplant tolerance unless the
inflammatory milieu in which donor-reactive T cells
perceive donor antigen is modified. We believe that
blocking ‘adverse’ inflammation in the peri-transplant
period can guide the majority of donor-activated naive
T cells into the graft-protective Treg mode. In addition,
strategies that foster the expression of Treg Foxp3 by
epigenetic modification may be utilized in conjunction
