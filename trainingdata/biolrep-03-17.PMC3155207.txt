Abstract
Monoclonal antibody technology has undergone rapid and innovative reinvention over the last
30 years. Application of these technologies to human samples revealed valuable therapeutic and
experimental
insights. These technologies, each with their own benefits and flaws, have proven
indispensable for immunological research and in our fight to provide new treatments and improved
vaccines for infectious disease.

Introduction
Studying the molecular arms race that characterizes our
constant fight against pathogens has revealed a powerful
source of therapeutics using an obvious and widely
available resource: our own immune response.
In
particular, it is the therapeutic potential of monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs)—highly specific, continuously gen-
erating antibodies derived from a single B cell clone that
target only a single site (epitope) on a single antigen—
that offers a lot of this potential. These are exciting times
in monoclonal antibody research. The steady stream
of technological advances is, if anything, accelerating in
the 21st century, knocking down obstacles in the process.
New applications are wide ranging—from finding the
Achilles heel of pathogens and elucidating autoimmune
disease, to treating infections in patients. The latest
round of developments allows us to hope that they may
be used in the clinic to kill cancer cells and eradicate
pathogens such as influenza.

The use of antibodies in research and therapeutics has
come a long way since the crude serum transfer
experiments of the 1800s, largely due to the advances
in modern technologies capable of such feats as

immortalizing human B cells, screening randomly paired
human antibody genes, and producing human antibody
in cell cultures. Such breakthroughs have highlighted the
role that monoclonal antibodies may play in the future
development of immune therapies and rational vaccine
design for rapidly changing pathogens such as influenza
and HIV. This article will explore the history and current
state of monoclonal antibody technology and how it has
contributed to therapeutics, both through direct clinical
treatments and by providing valuable insights into host–
pathogen interactions. Importantly, we will highlight how
these technologies help identify factors that produce
broadly neutralizing antibodies—antibodies that by
virtue of binding to certain epitopes important in the
viral life cycle, are able to bind many disparate viral strains
and prevent them from infecting their target cells. These
antibodies are vital in effective therapeutics and, ulti-
mately, successful vaccine design.

Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies as
therapeutics: from humble beginnings
Modern antibody treatments are rooted in classic experi-
ments performed in 1890 by Emil von Behring and
Kitasato Shibasaburo. Their experiments were the first to

bring to light that effective “antitoxins” to pathogens such
as tetanus and diphtheria could be generated in serum by
immunizing animals with bacterial lysates [1]. The use of
antitoxins generated in animals was such a major advance
in the treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases
that it earned a Nobel Prize for von Behring in 1901.
However, serum harvested from animals contains a
diverse mixture of antibodies,
including those with
irrelevant binding specificity or those that bind the
pathogen but do not lead to its removal or neutralization.
Such mixtures are polyclonal, meaning they are com-
prised of many different antibodies binding a variety of
epitopes and are produced by many different B cell clones.
Because of the heterogeneous and unpredictable compo-
sition of polyclonal antibodies, technologies targeted at
producing homogenous monoclonal antibodies have
undergone rapid development and advancement. The
very concept of monoclonal antibodies was not truly
realized until work in the 1950s by Frank Macfarlane
Burnet and David W. Talmage [2,3]. Their work culmi-
nated in a model of how our immune systems function
known as the theory of clonal selection, which included
the central tenant of modern immunology: that each
lymphocyte recognizes a single molecular target or
epitope via a unique receptor. This observation naturally
led to the idea that monoclonal antibodies arising from a
single B cell clone and recognizing the same epitope could
be a valuable and informative resource. Later generations
of scientists developed technologies to exploit the “one
B cell, one antibody” dogma to generate monoclonal
antibodies. Since the 1950s, a number of monoclonal
antibodies have been patented as treatments and effective
diagnostics.

Most current antibody-based therapeutics were originally
generated in rodents or in the laboratory with powerful
technologies such as phage display—a method for the
random generation of novel antibodies that relies on
random pairing of antibody genes and antigen screening
to select for those monoclonal antibodies with specifi-
cities of interest. However, potentially severe reactions
to nonhuman sources of antibodies can occur. Thus,
reliable sources of human monoclonal antibodies were
sought to not only overcome deleterious side effects but
also increase the chances of finding clinically relevant
antibodies to antigens of interest. Figure 1 provides a
timeline of critical advances in monoclonal antibody
technologies as detailed in the following sections.

Hybridoma technologies: long live the clone
One of the most important advances in modern medicine
was the advent of technologies designed to generate
monoclonal antibodies in 1975, when Köhler and
Milstein developed a system to immortalize individual

rodent B cells by fusing them to myeloma cancer cells,
producing a B cell hybridoma [4]. This achievement
would later earn them the Nobel Prize in medicine. In
essence, this technology produces an immortal mono-
clonal antibody factory that retains B cell specificity and
secretory abilities. In this way, the hybridoma cell lines
can be grown indefinitely, supplying investigators an
endless source of monoclonal antibodies. Examples of
human B cell fusions were demonstrated some 35 years
ago [5] and were used to generate antigen-specific cells a
few years later [6]. However, until recently, hybridomas
were only efficiently generated from mice and rat cells
because of limitations in the techniques for human B cell
fusion, including impossibly low fusion efficiencies and
instability of the resulting cell lines.

Although mouse and rat hybridoma technology revolu-
tionized modern biomedical science with many labora-
tory applications, ultimately the therapeutic potential of
such monoclonal antibodies were limited by the risk of
side effects. Treatments with nonhuman sera in particular
and, to some extent, nonhuman monoclonal antibodies
purified from sera could lead to a serious side effect
known as serum sickness. Serum sickness, which can be
fatal, is an immunological reaction against nonhuman
proteins contained in the animal serum. More relevant to
monoclonal antibody therapeutics, however,
is the
possibility for an anti-idiotypic host response; that is,
when an antibody treats another antibody as an antigen.
In these cases, the host mounts a response that targets the
antigen-binding region of the therapeutic monoclonal
antibody, effectively neutralizing its activity and rendering
it ineffectual. However, these issues were alleviated in part
by the advent of technologies to re-engineer nonhuman
antibodies so that they were “humanized.” Recombinant
DNA technologies were developed to swap out the rodent
structural domains for their human counterparts, leaving
only the specificity-determining regions intact in a process
known as complimentary determining region (CDR)
grafting [7]. Most notably, the only antibody therapeutic
that is licensed to prevent a viral infection (respiratory
syncytial virus) was generated by humanization of a
rodent monoclonal antibody [8]. Another approach used
humanized mice that have either been transgenically
engineered to express human antibody genes [9] or are
immune deficient and have been transplanted with
human lymphoid tissue [10].

Unfortunately, eliminating immunogenic domains on
monoclonal antibodies is not sufficient to prevent all
potential side effects. For instance, antibodies raised in
animals may cross-react unpredictably to human tissues.
Such autoreactive antibodies (also called autoantibo-
dies) target our own tissues and cause much of the

Figure 1. Monoclonal antibody production: a rapidly evolving technology

B cells are immune cells that circulate in the blood, each producing antibodies with unique amino acid sequences and binding specificities. Monoclonal antibody
(mAb) technology first relied on technologies that immortalized B cells of interest. As these protocols primarily used rodent cells, technologies designed to
humanize antibodies were needed to make them safe for human use. Later, the idea emerged that monoclonal antibodies were truly the product of the genes
that code for the variable region of their structure (their V genes). This gave way to technologies that relied on the cloning of antibody genes and their
production in vitro, which allowed researchers to paint a detailed portrait of the in vivo immune response. One of the most important advances in monoclonal
antibody technology was the adaptation and specialization of these protocols for human samples, allowing researchers to study directly relevant and
translatable human responses. CDR, complimentary determining region; CPG, —C—phosphate—G—; EBV, Epstein–Barr virus.

pathology in autoimmune diseases such as systemic
lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. B cells
expressing autoantibodies are normally culled from the
human immune system. However, antibodies that are
deemed nonautoreactive by a rodent’s immune system,
but have the potential to react against human proteins,

survive because they never encounter these human
proteins in the rodent system. Therefore, they may retain
some latent antihuman reactivity and may cross-react
catastrophically to uniquely human proteins. One
approach developed to alleviate some of these issues,
while maintaining the flexibility of using laboratory

animals, was the production of primatized monoclonal
antibodies. These monoclonal antibodies are raised in
primates and engineered to express human structural
domains. Since humans and monkeys are more closely
related, the antibodies that pass autoreactivity check-
points in monkeys will presumably be less cross-reactive
to human proteins than antibodies raised in rodents
[11]. Even with human monoclonal antibodies, genetic
variability between the person who was the source of the
antibody and the recipient (i.e., differences in blood
or HLA type) may lead to complications due to the
individual selective environment in which the B cell was
formed. Therefore, while the use of human antibodies
overcomes several complications and will likely expedite
development of monoclonal antibody therapeutics, it is
appreciated that all monoclonal antibody therapeutics
must first be vetted for safety.

One of the most frustrating challenges researchers faced
when they attempted to make fully-human hybridomas
was the low fusion efficiency achieved with traditional
methods such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment.
A recent breakthrough in human hybridoma technology
came when James Crowe and colleagues developed an
electroporation technique that increased fusion events
significantly compared with traditional methods [12].
The electrical current opens micropores in cell mem-
branes allowing nearby cells to fuse during the resealing
process. This protocol, used in combination with viral
transformation technologies discussed below, created a
much more efficient method to produce libraries of
immortalized human B cells. While hybridoma technol-
ogy still suffers from potentially unstable cell lines, these
technological strides have increased the efficiency of
producing large, representative monoclonal antibody
libraries to the point where elegant studies using human
hybridomas are now feasible. The successful isolation of
exceedingly rare 1918 Spanish flu pandemic reactive
antibodies from three elderly subjects who had been
infected over 80 years ago illustrates the power and
sensitivity of this technology [13]. Characterization of
neutralizing antibodies using this technology has per-
mitted these and other investigators to map the structural
and functional nuances of molecules contributing to the
virulence of influenza, HIV, and other pathogens, which
in turn provides targets for the development of new
therapeutics and vaccines.

B cell transformation: B cells are forever
Whereas hybridoma technology evolved to eventually
produce human antibodies, another technology went
straight to the source (human B cells), even in its earliest
forms.
In 1977, Steinitz and colleagues developed
approaches to virally transform human B cells, making

immortal cell cultures of human B cells [14]. At the time,
Rosén and colleagues had recently shown that Epstein–
Barr virus (EBV) transformation of human B cells led to
antibody secretion [15]. Steinitz et al. took this observation
to the next level, making cultures that produced polyclonal
mixtures of human antibodies that were reactive to an
antigen of interest. Serial dilution down to one single cell
clone from the starting pool of B cells enabled researchers
to apply this technology to monoclonal antibody
production. When combined with flow cytometry using
fluorescently labeled “bait” to sort enriched reactive cells
prior to EBV immortalization, the frequency of specific
B cell lines generated was substantially improved [16].
Much later, Traggiai, Lanzavecchia and colleagues
enhanced the efficiency of EBV transformation by provid-
ing innate immune stimulation using CpG (a Toll-like
receptor 9 agonist) in combination with EBV treatment
[17]. This and similar methods allow for the relatively
large-scale transformation of human memory B cells into
monoclonal antibody-secreting cell lines. Importantly,
this technology allows researchers to quickly identify
potential sources of clinically relevant antibodies. For
instance, following the severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) epidemic, this same group screened patients for
serum reactivity to the virus and then used the enhanced-
EBV technology to immortalize specific memory B cells
[17]. More recently, an EBV-independent method of B cell
immortalization was described. In this method, investi-
gators manipulated cellular pathways that control B cell
survival using transgenes and successfully generated
transformed B cell lines [18].

Even with advances to increase the efficiency of transfor-
mation, these methods still suffer from several drawbacks.
First, viral transformation causes cells lines to be unstable.
Second, memory B cells were used to produce the cell
lines. Since memory B cells represent the entire immuno-
logical history of the patient and not necessarily the
infection or vaccination of interest, it is not guaranteed
that all or most of these monoclonal antibodies will be
relevant. This makes it necessary to screen many cell lines
before a relevant clone is identified. Third, as this method
relies on the transformation of cells from the memory
compartment in particular, transient cells that arise during
infection, such as plasmablasts, are overlooked. This
prevents researchers from discerning between antibodies
that arise during a current immune response and those
that previously arose during historic immune responses
and merely cross-react to the current antigen. This is an
important consideration for pathogens such as influenza,
which rapidly mutate due to selective pressure. Therefore,
antibodies elicited by one variant will be less effective in
clearing another, allowing the latter virus to escape
antibodies from past immune responses.

Phage-display monoclonal antibodies: random
acts of immunity
The technologies covered thus far aimed at producing
carbon copies of human antibodies in vitro in order to
examine an in vivo response. However, one great stride
in monoclonal antibody technology came from
McCafferty and colleagues, who developed technology
to randomly reassemble human antibody genes in vitro,
producing novel combinations of antibodies that may
never appear in the human body. Seeking to increase
the speed of
identifying
antigen-specific antibodies, McCafferty and colleagues
adapted a method known as phage display for antibody
genes [19]. This method uses bacteriophage particles
containing a random combination of heavy- and light-
chain-encoding genes. These random heavy and light
chain pairs are then expressed on the surface of the
capsid. Affinity chromatography is then used to assay
for binding to antigens of
interest, allowing for
relatively quick identification and selection of heavy
and light chain pairs that bind the antigen of interest
with reasonable affinity.

the screening process for

Importantly, phage display allows the production of a
large variety of potentially high-affinity monoclonal
antibodies that may be rare or nonexistent
in the
human body. For example, phage display has been used
to generate what are, in essence, autoantibodies targeting
human proteins for the treatment of cancer or auto-
immune diseases; these antibodies would not survive the
human body’s normal mechanisms for culling autoreac-
tive antibodies. In fact, the anti-TNFa (tumor necrosis
factor alpha) inhibitory antibody HUMIRA (“Human
Monoclonal Antibody in Rheumatoid Arthritis”), the
world’s first structurally human monoclonal antibody
therapeutic, was identified using phage display. Further-
more,
the ability to iteratively screen for reactive
molecules in the lab also allows for the isolation of
exceedingly rare antibodies by phage display. For
example,
in 2009, two papers described the crystal
structure of phage-display antibodies that bound to a
region of the hemagglutinin protein on the surface of
influenza. This region is highly conserved on many
divergent influenza strains and is critical for viral function,
and thus can be targeted by antibodies to neutralize the
virus [20,21]. This finding demonstrated that at least
some critical influenza epitopes are evolutionarily con-
served and can be targets for therapeutics, including
monoclonal antibody drugs, as well as targets to improve
influenza vaccines with broader protection across many
influenza strains. Demonstrating a convergence of
approaches in the antibody community, Lanzavecchia
and colleagues later found that, although rare, screening
large numbers of EBV-transformed human memory B cell

clones could detect natural antibodies targeting similar
regions of hemagglutinin [22].

Unfortunately, the power of phage-display monoclonal
antibody technology is also its potential weakness: these
antibodies are produced in the laboratory, not
the
human body. Thus, these antibodies are not vetted by
natural mechanisms to avoid autoimmunity, increasing
the chances for unwanted or dangerous side effects. Also,
this technology relies on screening against known antigens,
limiting its application for the discovery of new antigens.
Nonetheless, a number of important human therapeutics
generated by phage display have either been licensed or
are currently in clinical trials, and its applications for
epitope discovery to identify better ways to neutralize
pathogens are unquestionable.

Expression-cloning: Intel from the battlefield
Recently, the business of producing monoclonal anti-
bodies has undergone yet another
technological
advancement—recombinant human monoclonal tech-
nology, or “expression cloning.” A rather new addition to
existing technologies, expression cloning is the produc-
tion of fully human monoclonal antibodies by isolating
single B cells from human blood and expressing their
antibody genes in vitro. This approach was first used on a
large scale by the Nussenzweig laboratory and alumni to
explore human B cell selection and tolerance (for
example, see [23-25], amongst a number of other
papers). This powerful method requires only hundreds
of B cells and allows for the production of antibodies
that are natural (fully human) from highly discrete
subsets of B cells that have become specialized within the
body. A significant advance in applying this approach
occurred when it was realized that antibody genes
from antibody-secreting cells, activated during ongoing
immune responses to vaccinations or infections, could
be isolated and then cloned to generate an unprece-
dented number of antigen-specific and fully human
mAbs in a short time span [26-28]. Furthermore, these
heavy- and light-chain-encoding genes are transfected
into mammalian cell cultures, which ensures that they
receive appropriate post-translational modification such
as glycosylation, a factor that influences specificity and
the monoclonal antibody’s ability to be tolerated by a
human recipient. This is especially relevant as glycosyla-
tion is lost in nonmammalian culture conditions, such as
those used for phage display.

The entire procedure from whole blood to purified
monoclonal antibodies can take as little as 14 days and
to date is the most efficient method available to generate
numerous human monoclonal antibodies that bind a
particular target. The drawback to this approach is that it

is best used on fresh blood collected over a short time
span during an active immune response in which
antibody-secreting cells are proliferating and present in
the blood. Our lab recently used this approach to make
the surprising observation that people infected with the
highly unique 2009 pandemic influenza strain preferen-
tially induced antibodies to epitopes conserved between
this novel strain and highly divergent strains to which the
patients had been previously exposed [28]. Critically, as
demonstrated recently in mice [29,30],
the targeted
regions of the influenza proteins were conserved because
they were vital for viral function and virulence; thus, the
antibodies elicited against the conserved regions were
both neutralizing and broadly protective. These promis-
ing data demonstrate that the eradication of influenza
as a human disease through a one-shot pan-influenza
vaccine is indeed feasible by using the right influenza
strain for immunization.

In conclusion
Since the first protocols were developed for monoclonal
antibody production, they have been a source of innova-
tion and technological advancement. The massive impact
on all fields of laboratory biology notwithstanding, the
contribution of monoclonal antibody technologies to
modern translational immunology is several-fold: (a) to
provide hope for directly translatable therapeutics and
diagnostic tools; (b) to provide invaluable insight into the
humoral response to foreign antigens and autoimmune
disease by examination of normal and diseased immune
responses; and (c) to develop more effective or new
vaccines and treatments by studying the natural mechan-
isms and targets of antibodies that can neutralize
pathogens. These factors have propelled monoclonal
antibody technology from crude beginnings to the elegant
and evolving technology currently available.

In the future, monoclonal antibody technology promises
to become higher throughput and more efficient, allowing
scientists to screen for exceedingly rare antibody specifici-
ties and B cell subsets. Furthermore, in combination with
technologies evolving in vitro, valuable human antibodies
may become further optimized, both in terms of their
specificity and stability. For instance, researchers are
currently trying to stabilize antibodies so that they can
survive extreme temperatures, allowing field medics to have
access to these treatments without concern for degradation
when ideal storage conditions are not available.

Another attractive potential of monoclonal antibody
treatment is the possibility of fine-tuning the function
of an antibody by changing its “constant region.” Our
bodies naturally accomplish this using genetic recombi-
nation to pair the variable, antigen-binding exon with

various specialized isotype gene exons (such as IgM, IgG1
through 4, IgA, and IgE). Antibodies vary in their effector
functions depending on their isotype; isotypes confer the
ability to lyse targets by activating lytic “complement”
proteins in sera, and can cross mucosal barriers and bind
specialized receptors on the surface of other immune
cells, which can lead to antigen clearance or direct killing
of the antibody-coated pathogen or protein. By outfitting
the monoclonal antibody with the most appropriate
effector function (or a cocktail thereof), we can take
into account the desired outcome of a treatment, be it
clearance of a pathogen or direct killing of cancerous
cells. Such technological strides could make monoclonal
antibodies a ubiquitous therapy for a variety of condi-
tions and diseases.

The current state of monoclonal antibody technology is
enabling exciting advancements in immunotherapies
and understanding of host–pathogen interactions.
Maybe more importantly, it is now evident that insight
into our natural immune responses can facilitate rational
vaccine development. Thus, the most important lessons
may be those we’ve garnered from our bodies’ natural
responses; not only can we can capitalize on our strengths,
such as targeting of specific pathogenic epitopes, but we
can also compensate for our inherent weaknesses, such
as the rarity of our most powerful antibodies. In the end,
the information we gather from monoclonal antibody
technology may be more important than the direct
attainment of
therapeutics (borrowing from an old
adage, catch a man a fish and he’ll eat for a day, but
teach a man to fish and he’ll eat for a lifetime). Similarly,
by studying what antibodies can teach us, we may
someday produce vaccines that eradicate many infectious
diseases that have a profound impact on human health
such as influenza, hepatitis, or HIV.
