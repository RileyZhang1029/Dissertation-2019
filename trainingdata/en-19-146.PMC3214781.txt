ABSTRACT

Matrix  metalloproteinases  (MMPs)  are  zinc-dependent  endopeptidases  that  degrade 
the  extracellular  matrix  and  other  extracellular  proteins.  Upregulation  of  MMPs  activity 
is  known  to  be  required  for  the  inflammatory  cell  infiltration  after  spinal  cord  injury 
(SCI)  and  most  likely  contributes  to  early  blood  spinal  barrier  disruption  and  inflam-
mation,  thereby  leading  to  the  impairment  of  functional  recovery.  Here,  we  examined 
the  effect  of  ethanol  extract  of  Bupleurum  falcatum  (BF)  on  functional  recovery  by 
inhibiting  MMP-2  and  -9  activation  and  inflammation  after  SCI.  Rats  received  a  mo-
derate,  weight-drop  contusion  injury  to  spinal  cord  were  administered  orally  with  BF  at 
a  dose  of  100  mg/kg  for  14  d  and  functional  recovery  was  measured  by  Basso- 
Beattie-Bresnahan  locomotor  open  field  behavioral  rating  test,  inclined  plane  test  and 
foot  print  analysis.  To  examine  the  neuroprotective  effect  of  BF,  TUNEL  staining  and 
counting  were  also  performed.  In  addition,  the  expression  and/or  activation  of  MMP-2, 
MMP-9  and  inflammatory  mediators  such  as  TNF-α,  IL-1β,  COX-2,  and  iNOS  were 
examined  by  RT-PCR  and  gelatin  zymography  using  spinal  cord  tissue  from  1  d  after 
injury.  Our  data  showed  that  BF  significantly  inhibited  the  expression  and  activation  of 
both  MMP-2  and  MMP-9  after  SCI.  The  mRNA  expressions  of  TNF-α,  IL-1β,  COX-2, 
and  iNOS  were  also  significantly  attenuated  by  BF.  Furthermore,  BF  reduced  apoptotic 
cell  death  at  1  d  after  injury,  thereby  significantly  reduced  lesion  volume  and  improved 
functional  recovery.  Taken  together,  these  results  suggest  that  BF  can  be  used  as  a 
potential  therapeutic  agent  for  treating  acute  spinal  injury.

INTRODUCTION

    Spinal  cord  injury  (SCI)  is  a  leading  cause  of 
permanent  disability,  resulting  in  partial  or  complete 
loss  of  motor  and  sensory  function  below  the  lesion 

important  roles 

site  (Wells  et  al.,  2003).  Inflammatory  and  immune 
responses  are  one  of  the  major  factors  exacer-
bating  the  pathogenesis  after  SCI.  It  is  known  that 
blood-brain  barrier  (BBB)  permeability  and  thereby 
blood  infiltration  is  increased  after  SCI.  Infiltrated 
cells  such  as  macrophage  and  neurophil  are  also 
known  to  be  involved  in  inflammation  after  SCI. 
Furthermore,  proteinases  and  in  particular,  matrix 
metalloproteinases  (MMPs),  are  likely  mediators  of 
early  secondary  vascular  pathogenesis  after  SCI 
(Noble  et  al.,  2002;  Bareyre  and  Schwab,  2003). 
    MMPs  are  soluble  and  cell-surface  bound  zinc- 
dependent  endopeptidases  (Birkedal-Hansen  et  al., 
1993)  that  degrade  the  extracellular  matrix  and 
other  extracellular  proteins  (Sternlicht  and  Werb, 
2001).  MMPs  also  play 
in  re-
modeling  of  the  extracellular  matrix,  tissue  mor-
phogenesis,  and  wound  healing  (Werb,  1997).  How-
ever,  excessive  proteolytic  activity  of  MMPs  can  be 
detrimental,  leading  to  numerous  pathologic  con-
ditions,  including  BBB  disruption  (Rosenberg  et  al., 
1998)  and  inflammation  (Mun-Bryce  and  Rosen-
berg,  1998).  For  example,  MMPs  are  significantly 
upregulated  after  SCI  in  mice,  rat  and  human 
(Noble  et  al.,  2002;  Wells  et  al.,  2003;  Buss  et  al., 
2007).  Furthermore,  MMPs  mainly  expressed  during 
the  first  weeks  after  injury  are  known  to  be  involved 
in  the  destructive  inflammation  events  of  protein 
breakdown  and  phagocytosis  by  infiltrating  neutro-
phils  and  macrophages  and 
in  enhanced  per-
meability  of  the  blood  spinal  cord  barrier  (Noble  et 
al.,  2002;  Wells  et  al.,  2003;  Buss  et  al.,  2007).  In 
particular, 
the  activities  of  MMP-2  and  MMP-9, 
which  degrade  types  IV  and  V  collagen,  and  thus 
modify  constituents  of  basal  laminae  (Werb,  1997) 
are  known  to  be  increased  within  1  d  after  SCI 
(Noble  et  al.,  2002;  Choi  et  al.,  2010).  Moreover,  it 
was  clearly  demonstrated  that  the  pharmacological 
blockade  of  MMPs,  limited  to  the  first  3  d  after 
injury,  is  neuroprotective  and  promotes  long-term 
recovery  of  hindlimb  function  (Noble  et  al.,  2002). 
However, 
lost  when 
treatment  is  extended  beyond  the  acutely  injured 
cord 
tissue  re-
modeling  (Trivedi  et  al.,  2005;  Hsu  et  al.,  2006). 
These  data  suggest  that  the  attenuation  of  MMP 
activities  in  early  stage  after  SCI  may  exert  be-
neficial  effect  and  improve  functional  recovery.

Recovery  by  Bupleurum  falcatum  after  SCI 147

    The  roots  of  Bupleurum  falcatum  have  been  used 
in  Oriental  countries  as  a  herbal  medicine 
for 
treating  hepatitis,  nephritis,  influenza,  inflammation, 
and  bacterial  and  viral  infections  (Kumazawa  et  al., 
1990).  The  extract  of  Bupleurum  falcatum  (BF) 
contains  various  compounds  including  a  series  of 
triterpene  saponins  namely  saikosaponins  (Ebata  et 
al.,  1996).  Previous  reports  showed  that  saikos-
aponins  exhibit  a  variety  of  pharmacological  ac-
tivites  including  anti-inflammatory,  immunomodula-
tory  and  anti-bacterial  activites  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
(Yamaguchi  et  al.,  1985;  Kumazawa  et  al.,  1990). 
Furthermore,  saikosaponins  have  been  shown  to 
modulate 
the  gene  expression  or  activation  of 
MMP-2  in  endothelial  cells  and  spleen  cells  from 
picryl  chloride-induced  ear  contact  sensitivity  mice 
(Shyu  et  al.,  2004;  Zhang  et  al.,  2006).  These 
observations  suggest  that  BF  may  exert  anti-in-
flammatory  effect  by  inhibiting  MMPs  activity.
    In  this  study,  we  showed  that  the  systemic  ad-
ministration  of  BF  significantly  improves  functional 
recovery  after  SCI  in  part  by  inhibiting  the  ex-
pression  and/or  activation  of  MMP-2,  MMP-9  and 
inflammatory  mediators,  thereby  inhibiting  apoptotic 
cell  death  and  reducing  lesion  volume.

Spinal  cord  injury

et 

al., 

(Yune 

2007).  For 

    Adult  male  Sprague  Dawley  [Sam:TacN  (SD)  BR; 
Samtako,  Osan,  Korea]  rats  were  subjected  to  mo-
derate  contusion  injury  (10  g×25  mm)  as  described 
previously 
the 
sham-operated  controls,  the  animals  underwent  a 
T10  laminectomy  without  weight-drop  injury.  Sur-
gical  interventions  and  postoperative  animal  care 
were  performed  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines 
and  Policies  for  Rodent  Survival  Surgery  provided 
by  the  Animal  Care  Committee  of  the  Kyung  Hee 
University. 

Preparation  of  BF 

    The  dried  roots  of  Bupleurum 
falcatum  were 
extracted  with  70%  ethanol  as  described  previously 
(Kim  et  al.,  2001).  The  ethanol  filtrate  was  eva-
porated  in  vacuo,  and  powdered  BF  was  stored  at 

−20oC  until  use.  By  HPLC  analysis,  BF  contains 

saikosaponin  A,  B1,  B2,  B3,  B4,  C,  D,  G,  H  and  I.

BF  administration

in  sterile  de-
    Powdered  BF  were  suspended 
ionized  water  and  administrated  orally  at  a  dose  of 
(100  mg/kg)  beginning  at  2  h  after  SCI  and  then 
once  a  day  for  14  d.

RNA  isolation  and  RT-PCR

    RNA  isolation  using  TRIZOL  Reagent  (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad,  CA)  and  cDNA  synthesis  were  performed 
as  described  previously  (Lee  et  al.,  2010).  The 
primers  used  for  MMP-2,  MMP-9,  iNOS,  COX-2, 
TNF-α,  IL-1β  and  GAPDH  were  synthesized  by 
the  Genotech  Corp  (Daejeon,  Korea).  Details  of 
primers  used  for  PCR  in  this  study  are  shown  in 
Table  1.  GAPDH  was  used  as  an  internal  control. 
Experiments  were  repeated  three  times  and  the 
values  obtained 
intensity  were 
subjected  to  statistical  analysis.  The  gels  shown  in 
figures  are  representatives  of  results  from  three 
separate  experiments.

Gelatin  zymography

    Total  protein  extracts  from  spinal  cord  samples  at 
1  d  after  injury  were  prepared  as  described  pre-
viously  (Yune  et  al.,  2007).  Spinal  cord  tissues  (1 
cm)  were  homogenized  in  a  lysis  buffer  and  the 
tissue  homogenates  were  incubated  for  20  min  at 
4oC,  and  centrifuged  at  25,000×g  for  30  min  at  4oC. 
The  protein  level  of  the  supernatant  was  deter-
mined  using  the  BCA  assay  (Pierce,  Rockford,  IL). 
Gelatin  zymography  was  performed  by  using  10% 
zymogram  gel  (Invitrogen)  as  previously  described 

Table  1.  Primers  used  in  the  present  study

(Choi  et  al.,  2010).  In  brief,  50μg  proteins  were 
mixed  with  sample  buffer  and  loaded  without  boil-
ing.  After  electrophoresis,  the  gel  were  soaked  in 
2.5%  Triton  X-100,  rinsed,  and  incubated  for  24  h 
at  37oC  in  developing  buffer  (50  mM  Tris-HCl,  pH 
8.5,  0.2  M  NaCl,  5  mM  CaCl2,  0.02%  Brii35).  After 
incubation,  gels  were  stained  with  0.5%  Coomassie 
blue  and  then  destained.  Clear  bands  on  the  zymo-
gram  were  indicative  of  gelatinase  activity.

Behavioral  tests

    Examination  of  functional  deficits  after  injury  was 
conducted  by  using 
the  21-point  Basso-Beattie- 
Bresnahan  (BBB)  locomotion  scale,  inclined  plane 
test  and  foot  print  analysis  as  previously  described 
(Yune  et  al.,  2007). 

Tissue  preparation 

    After  SCI,  spinal  cord  sections  were  prepared  as 
described  previously  (Yune  et  al.,  2007).  In  brief, 
animals  were  perfused  via  cardiac  puncture  with 
4%  paraformaldehyde.  A  20-mm  section  of  the 
spinal  cord,  centered  at  the  lesion  site,  was  dis-
sected  out,  post-fixed  and  placed  in  30%  sucrose. 
The  segment  was  embedded  in  OCT  for  frozen 
sections,  and  longitudinal  or  transverse  sections 
were  then  cut  at  10  or  20μm  on  a  cryostat 
(CM1850;  Leica,  Germany).

    One  day  after  injury,  serial  spinal  cord  sections 
(20μm  thickness)  were  collected  and  every  100
μm  section  was  processed  for  TUNEL  as  pre-
viously  described  (Yune  et  al.,  2007).  Only  those 
cells  showing  morphological 
features  of  nuclear 
condensation  and/or  compartmentalization  only  in 
the  gray  matter  (GM)  were  counted  as  a  TUNEL- 
positive.  Quantitation  of  TUNEL-positive  cells  was 
accomplished  by  counting

hypothesis  whether  BF  may  inhibit  MMP-2  and 
MMP-9  activation  after  SCI,  we  first  examined  the 
effect  of  BF  on  the  expression  of  MMP-2  and 
MMP-9  by  RT-PCR  at  1  d  after  injury.  A  basal  level 
of  MMP-2  expression  was  detected  in  sham  control. 
A  significant  upregulation  of  MMP-2  expression  was 
observed  at  1  d  after  SCI  and  BF 
treatment 
significantly  reduced  the  MMP-2  mRNA  expression 
(Fig.  1A,  B).  Similarly,  MMP-9  mRNA  was  markedly 
increased  at  1  d  after  SCI  and  BF  treatment  also 
significantly  attenuated  the  MMP-9  mRNA  expres-
sion  (Fig.  1A,  B).  However,  MMP-9  expression  was 
not  observed 
the  sham  control.  Next,  we 
examined 
the  enzyme  activities  of  MMP-2  and 
MMP-9  by  gelatin  zymography  using  spinal  cord 
total  extract  from  1  d  after  injury.  As  shown  in 
Figure  1C,  active  form  of  MMP-2  and  MMP-9  was 
strongly  induced  at  1  d  after  injury.  Pro-MMP-2  and 
pro-MMP-9  were  also  induced  by  SCI.  Furthermore, 
BF  treatment  significantly  reduced  the  degree  of 
activation  of  MMP-2  and  MMP-9  when  compared  to 
vehicle-treated  control  (e.g.,  active  MMP-2;  BF 
1.66±0.08  vs  vehicle  3.22±0.22,  p＜0.05/active 
MMP-9;  BF  5.3±0.11  vs  vehicle  7.5±0.25,  p＜0.05) 
(Fig.  1B,  D).

BF  inhibits  the  expression  of  inflammatory 
mediators  after  SCI 

    It  has  been  known  that  BBB  disruption  by  MMPs 
including  MMP-2  and  MMP-9  induces  blood  in-
filtration  and  thereby  contributes  to  inflammation 
after  SCI.  Since  BF  reduced  the  expression  and 
activity  of  MMP-2  and  MMP-9  after  SCI  (Fig.  1),  we 
hypothesized  that  BF  would  inhibit  the  expression 
of  inflammatory  factors  after  SCI.  As  shown  in  Fig. 

2A,  TNF-α,  IL-1β,  COX-2  and  iNOS  mRNA  ex-
pression  were  markedly  increased  after  SCI  as 
reported  (Lee  et  al.,  2004;  Yune  et  al.,  2009).  In 
particular,  BF  treatment  significantly  alleviated  the 
expression  levels  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  and 
mediators  when  compared  with  those  of  vehicle- 
treated  control  at  1  d  after  injury  (Fig.  2).

BF  inhibits  apoptotic  cell  death  after  SCI

    Trauma  to  the  spinal  cord  results  in  extensive 
apoptotic  cell  death  (Liu  et  al.,  1997;  Lee  et  al., 
2003).  Based  on  the  anti-inflammatory  effects  of  BF 
in  the  injured  spinal  cord  (Fig.  2),  we  hypothesized 
that  BF  would  inhibit  apoptotic  cell  death  after  SCI. 
Many  TUNEL-positive  cells  were  seen  mostly  within 
the  lesion  area  in  the  gray  matter  (GM)  at  1  d  after 
injury.  As  shown  in  Fig.  3,  BF  treatment  significantly 
decreased 
the  number  of  TUNEL-positive  cells 
when  compared  to  the  vehicle-  treated  control  (BF 
132±9  vs.  Vehicle  205±17  cells,  p＜0.05)  (Fig.  3B). 
Thus,  our  results  indicate  that  BF  inhibits  apoptotic 
cell  death  after  injury.

BF  improves  functional  recovery  after  SCI

report  showed 

    Previous 
that  pharmacological 
inhibition  of  MMPs  at  a  early  stage  after  SCI 
improves  locomotor  recovery  (Noble  et  al.,  2002). 
Since  BF  treatment  inhibited  the  expression  and 
activity  of  MMP-2  and  MMP-9  and  also  attenuated 
apoptotic  cell  death  after  injury  (Fig.  1  and  3),  we 
expected  that  BF  would  improve  functional  recovery 
following  injury.  Injured  rats  were  treated  with  BF 
(100  mg/kg)  for  14  consecutive  days  and  functional 
recovery  was  then  evaluated  for  35  d  using  the 
BBB  rating  scale,  inclined  plane  test  and  footprint

analysis.  The  hindlimbs  paralyzed  immediately  after 
injury  were  spontaneously  recovered  within  7  to  14 
d  after  injury  (Fig.  4A)  as  in  previous  report  (Yune 
et  al.,  2007).  The  BBB  scores  were  significantly 
higher  in  rats  treated  with  100  mg/kg  of  BF  by  14 
to  35  d  after  SCI  than  in  vehicle-treated  rats  (35  d, 
BF  11.25±0.5  vs  Vehicle  9.0±1.0,  p＜0.05)  (Fig. 
4A).  The  angle  of  incline,  determined  1∼4  weeks 
after  injury,  was  also  significantly  higher  in  BF- 
treated  rats  than  in  vehicle-treated  rats  at  4  weeks 
after  SCI  (4  weeks,  BF  60±2.1  vs  Vehicle  53±2.2, 
p＜0.05)  (Fig.  4B).  Finally,  footprint  analyses  ob-
tained  from  sham-treated,  vehicle-treated  and  BF- 
treated  rats  at  35  d  after  SCI  revealed  that  BF- 
treated  rats  show  more  consistent  forelimb-hindlimb 
coordination  and  less  toe  drag  than  in  vehicle 
control  (Fig.  4C).  With  the  25  mm  insult  used  in  the 
present  study,  the  hind  paws  as  well  as  the  central 
pads  of  vehicle-treated  animals  were  not  clearly 
recorded  because  of  the  hindlimb  drags  (Fig.  4C). 
Thus,  we  didn’t  quantify  footprint  analysis  using  toe 
spread  and  ipsilateral  distances  (limb  coordination) 
in  this  study. 

BF  reduces  lesion  volume  after  SCI

    The  functional  deficit  after  SCI  is  known  to  be 
correlated  with  the  massive  tissue  loss  (Basso  et 
al.,  1996).  To  examine  whether  BF  preserves  spinal 
cord  tissue  after  injury,  we  measured  the  lesion 
volume  using  rats  tested  for  behavioral  analysis.  As 
shown  in  Fig.  4D,  BF  treatment  significantly  re-
duced  the  lesion  volume  at  38  d  after  injury  than  in 
vehicle-treated  rats  (BF  4.2±1.2  mm3  vs  Vehicle 
8.5±0.7  mm3,  p＜0.05). 

DISCUSSION

    In  this  study,  we  demonstrated  the  first  time  that 
after  moderate  contusion  injury  to  the  rat  spinal 
cord,  BF  treatment  improved  functional  recovery  by 
inhibiting  the  expression  and/or  activation  MMP-2, 
MMP-9  and  inflammatory  mediators,  thereby  atte-
nuating  apoptotic  cell  death. 
    A  critical  finding  in  this  study  is  that  BF  can 
effectively  inhibit  MMP  upregulation,  thereby  im-
prove  locomotor  function  after  SCI.  The  functional 
impairment  after  SCI  may  be  attributed  to  the  early 
involvement  of  MMPs  in  secondary  pathogenesis

after  injury.  It  has  been  known  that  in  brain  and 
injured  spinal  cord,  MMPs  including  MMP-2  and 
MMP-9,  contribute  to  early  secondary  pathogenesis 
by  disrupting  the  BBB  and  promoting  inflammation 
(Rosenberg  et  al.,  1998;  Noble  et  al.,  2002),  oxi-
dative  stress  (Gasche  et  al.,  2001)  and  demye-
lination  (Asahi  et  al.,  2001).  It  was  also  known  that 
animals  treated  with  an  MMP  inhibitor  within  the 
first  3  d  after  injury  showed  less  disruption  of  the 
BBB,  attenuation  of  neutrophil  infiltration,  and  sig-
nificant  locomotor  recovery  compared  with  vehicle- 
treated  control  (Noble  et  al.,  2002).  Our  data 
indicate  that  BF  treatment  significantly  inhibited  the 
expression  and  activity  of  MMP-2  and  MMP-9  after 
SCI  (Fig.  1).  Also,  the  expression  of  inflammatory 
mediators  such  as  TNF-α, 
IL-1β,  COX-2  and

iNOS  was  significantly  decreased  following  BF  treat-
ment  (Fig.  2).  In  addition,  the  number  of  TUNEL- 
positive  cells  in  the  GM  at  1  d  and  the  lesion 
volume  at  35  d  after 
injury  was  significantly 
inhibited  by  BF  treatment  (Fig.  3,  4).  Thus,  these 
results  suggest  that  the  effect  of  neuroprotection 
followed 
likely 
mediated  in  part  by  inhibiting  MMP-2  and  MMP-9, 
then  attenuating  the  increase  of  BBB  permeability 
and  blood  infiltration  after  SCI.  However,  we  did  not 
examine  whether  BF  inhibits  BBB  disruption  and 
blood  infiltration  after  injury  in  this  study.  Further 
study  may  be  required  to  elucidate  the  effects  of 
BF  on  BBB  permeability  and  blood  infiltration  after 
SCI.
    It  has  also  been  known  that  the  beneficial  effect 
of  MMP  inhibition  is  lost  by  long  term  blockade  of 
MMPs  for  the  first  week  after  SCI  (Trivedi  et  al., 
2005).  Hsu  et  al.  (2006)  also  demonstrated  that 
MMP-2  increased  between  7  and  14  d  after  injury, 

involved 

in  wound  healing  and

tissue  re-
modeling  after  SCI.  In  this  study,  we  observed  the 
inhibition  of  MMP-2  by  BF  at  1  d  after  injury.  In 
addition,  it  was  reported  that  the  general  MMPs 
blocker,  GM6001  treatment  for  first  3  d  after  SCI 
improved  functional  recovery  (Noble  et  al.,  2002). 
Furthermore,  when  we  examine  the  effect  of  BF  on 
MMP-2  at  7  and  14  d  after  injury,  neither  gene 
expression  nor  gelatinase  activity  of  MMP-2  was 
changed  (data  not  shown).  Therefore  we  believe 
that  the  inhibition  of  MMP-2  and  MMP-9  activity  by 
BF  at  1  d  after  injury  may  contribute  to  beneficial  to 
functional  recovery.  MMP-12  is  also  known  to  be 
upregulated  at  5  d  and  involved  in  the  dysfunction 
in  BBB  permeability  and  inflammation  after  SCI 
(Wells  et  al.,  2003).  Furthermore,  Wells  et  al. 
(2003)  showed  that  functional  recovery  was  sig-
nificantly  improved  in  MMP-12  null  mice  compared 
with  wild-type  controls.  Therefore,  further  study  may 
be  needed  to  examine  the  effect  of  BF  on  MMP-12

    We  examined  the  neuroprotective  effect  of  BF 
after  SCI  using  total  ethanol  extract  in  the  present 
study.  During  the  experiment,  neither  significant 
side  effects  nor  an  increase  in  mortality  by  BF 
treatment  were  observed  (data  not  shown).  As  a

1985;  Kang  et  al.,  2008),  further  study  to  find  active 
components  exhibiting  MMP  inhibition  and  examine 
their  neuroprotection  after  SCI  will  be  processed. 
    In  summary,  our  results  indicate  that  the  inhibition 
of  MMP-2  and  MMP-9  by  BF  may  account  for  in 
part 
its  neuroprotective  effect  and  provide  an 
evidence  for  BF  as  a  potential  therapeutic  agent 
after  SCI.
