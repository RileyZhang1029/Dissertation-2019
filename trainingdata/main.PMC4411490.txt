Abstract Cell cycle progression is coordinated with metabolism, signaling and other complex cellular functions.
The investigation of cellular processes in a cell cycle stage-dependent manner is often the subject of modern molecular and cell biological research.
Cell cycle synchronization and immunostaining of cell cycle markers facilitate such analysis, but are limited in use due to unphysiological experimental stress, cell type dependence and often low flexibility.
Here, we describe high-content microscopy-assisted cell cycle phenotyping (hiMAC), which integrates high-resolution cell cycle profiling of asynchronous cell populations with immunofluorescence microscopy.
hiMAC is compatible with cell types from any species and allows for statistically powerful, unbiased, simultaneous analysis of protein interactions, modifications and subcellular localization at all cell cycle stages within a single sample.
For illustration, we provide a hiMAC analysis pipeline tailored to study DNA damage response and genomic instability using a 34-day protocol, which can be adjusted to any other cell cycle stage-dependent analysis.
Introduction Progression through the cell cycle is tightly coordinated by molecular pathways, which sense intra-and extracellular signals and orchestrate vital cellular functions with DNA replication and cell division [1].

Synchronization protocols are often used to investigate cell cycle-dependent biological processes in mammalian cells in a given experimental setting; however, these are problematic because they load experimental stresses.
Immunofluorescence (IF) imaging facilitates cell cycle staging and cell phenotyping, but a combination of both strongly restricts analysis flexibility due to the limitations of fluorescence channels and antibodies, which precludes powerful applications such as cell cycle-based colocalization analysis.
Live cell imaging of fluorophore-tagged cell cyclemarkers has beenused tomonitor cell cycle progression in unsynchronized cell populations, but it requires stable protein overexpression and is limited in the use of additional markers.
In order to overcome these challenges, we developed hiMAC, which integrates two-color (DAPI/EdU) cell cycle profiling and the analysis of complex cell phenotypes in a single high-content microscopy pipeline.
hiMAC provides an unbiased method for cell cycle stage-dependent analysis of protein localization, interactions, structural features and pathway activities with a high statistical power, which ultimately provide cell cycle-based fingerprints for many biological processes accessible by IF imaging.
Overview of hiMAC The hiMAC methodology enables the analysis of localization and modification dynamics of multiple proteins simultaneously in all cell cycle phases of non-synchronized cells.
It consists of the integrated analysis of the cell cycle and any cell features of interest by high-content fluorescence microscopy.
It can process a large number of samples, which is necessary for setups with multiple treatment conditions and time points.
High-resolution cell cycle information is derived from DNA content (DAPI) and replication status (e.g., incorporation of thymidine analog EdU), which confers species-independence and maximum flexibility in the choice of proteins to analyze.
Figure 1 illustrates the hiMAC workflow.
A detailed stepby-step description is provided in the Procedure section.
Figure 2 exemplifies the hiMAC procedure for the co-localization analysis of two DNA damage markers, recombination marker Rad51 and general DNA damage marker cH2AX, throughout the cell cycle in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).
DNA lesions were induced by deletion of the DNA damage response gene Nbs1 as verified by the immunoblotting (Figure 2A).
The hiMAC protocol begins with pulse labeling of cells with EdU, followed by fixation and permeabilization (Figure 1).
A click reaction is performed to label S-phase cells [6], and proteins of interest and DNA are labeled with immunostaining and DAPI, respectively.
Images are recorded by automated microscopy (Figure 2B) and analyzed in a customized CellProfiler [7] pipeline to measure intensities of DAPI (DNA content and condensation) and of EdU (replication status) in individual nuclei, and to identify the pattern of objects of interest, such as proteins, organelles and micronuclei (Figure 2C).
Finally, a cell cycle profile is constructed, cell cycle phases are gated (Figure 2D and E), and the objects of interest are analyzed for all individual cell cycle phases (G1, early/mid/ late S and G2/M) (Figure 2F).
While hiMAC can be used to study cell cycle-dependent phenomena in general, here we specifically provide a pipeline to analyze the cell cycle phase-dependent localization of any two proteins and their interaction within the nucleus.
We successfully applied this pipeline to analyze the dynamic localization of DNA damage response proteins (53BP1, Rad51, cH2AX, etc.)
throughout the cell cycle [8].
Experimental design Several parameters should be considered in the hiMAC protocol according to the experimental purpose.
EdU pulse labeling is compatible with many cell treatments.
However, EdU fails to label S-phase cells under conditions that block DNA synthesis (e.g., by hydroxyurea); the EdU pulse thus needs to be applied before such a treatment.
It is recommended to include one sample of asynchronous untreated cells as undisturbed cell cycle control in every experiment.
Positive and negative control samples should be included for each post-translational modification to assess maximum signal induction.
When quantifying the level and localization of an ectopically expressed protein, appropriate controls such as non-functional or nondegradable isoforms of the same protein, or a different protein with the same tag and similar localization should be included.
The cell fixation and immunostaining methods for high antibody specificity need to be optimized before high-throughput analysis [9].
siRNA knock-down of the protein epitope of interest is a good control for antibody specificity.
While nonconfocal microscopy is sufficient for hiMAC cell cycle profiling, confocal image acquisition may be of greater advantage for the resolution of fine structures of interest (nuclear foci, mitochondria, etc.).
Results Cell cycle profiling Cell cycle profiling of an asynchronous population of MEF cells yielded cell cycle profiles with clear separation of G1, S and G2/M populations (Figure 2E, left panel).

Bruhn C et al/ High-content Microscopy-assisted Cell Cycle Phenotyping hiMAC 257 followed by sequential passage of cells through early/mid/late S phase into G2/M phase (Figure 3A).
In asynchronous MEF cells, the use of the S-phase population (EdU+) as a reference for cells with low DNA condensation allowed separation of G2/M cells (4 N, EdU) into early G2 and late G2/M cells on the basis of mean DAPI intensity by hiMAC (Figure 3B and C).
Co-staining with mitosis marker phospho-histone H3 (S28) (p-H3) showed that indeed most late G2/M nuclei were p-H3 positive (Figure 3B, 84%), demonstrating that DNA condensation within the G2/M population can be used as marker for late G2/M phases.
Altogether, hiMAC facilitates gating of G1, early/mid/late S and early G2, as well as late G2/M populations.
Application of hiMAC to different cell cycle phase-dependent analyses We have used hiMAC in three major applications, namely, the cell cycle phase-dependent analysis of DNA damage sources, pathway activities within subcellular organelles and colocalization pattern.

The lower panel shows cell cycle profiles.
The DAPI intensity of the G1 population at 28 h after release was used as reference for DNA content.
Note that DAPI and EdU labeling allows to monitor the progression of released cells through S phase.

Asynchronous MEF cells were pulse labeled with EdU, stained with DAPI, EdU and a phospho-histone H3 (S28) (p-H3) antibody as mitosis marker and analyzed by hiMAC.
S cells (red dots) were used as internal reference with low DNA condensation to set a DAPI mean threshold for the classification of G2/M cells (green dots) as either early G2 (low DNA condensation) or late G2/M (high DNA condensation) cells (B).
p-H3 vs. DAPI mean scatter plots confirm that high DNA condensation in G2/M correlates well with p-H3 (right panel), whereas S cells have low DNA condensation and are p-H3 negative (left panel) (C).

258 Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 255265 Investigation of the cell cycle dependence of pathway activities For this application, a microscopy-based readout for pathway activity is integrated into the hiMAC procedure.
Such readout typically relies on the immunostaining of either reaction products or pathway components to reveal their subcellular localization or modification.
We used his application to demonstrate the activation of specific DNA damage responses in G2-phase cells after the deletion of Nbs1 [8].
This application can also be used to measure cell cycle phase-dependent pathway activities under unperturbed conditions or in response to experimental treatments (genotoxic agents, inhibitors, gene deletions, etc.).
As an example shown in Figure 4, we investigated the kinetics of cH2AX foci as a general DNA damage marker in the response of wild-type MEFs to DNA polymerase inhibitor, aphidicolin (Aph), at 200 nM, a concentration that permits replication at a reduced rate (Figure 4A).
As expected, hiMAC analysis revealed accumulation of S-phase cells (Figure 4B), reduction of EdU incorporation (Figure 4C) and induction of cH2AX foci in early/mid/late S phase (Figure 4DF), suggesting that DNA damage was highly specific to S phase and associated with impaired DNA replication.
Investigation of the origin and fate of subcellular structures In this application, a hiMAC time course is recorded after a specific treatment, such as chemical inhibitor treatment, gene deletion or knock-down by siRNA.
hiMAC maps the cell cycle phase in which the structure of interest first appears.
Analysis of the following time points then traces the structural changes during cell cycle progression.
We have used this application to reveal the origin and progression of endogenous DNA damages and micronuclei (MN) in Nbs1-deleted cells [8].
For example, we assessed replication and homologous recombination activity in MN in Nbs1-deleted MEF cells [10] by quantifying EdU incorporation in all MN and Rad51 localization to damaged (cH2AX+) MN, respectively.
As expected, replication occurred in MN in early/mid/late S phase but not in G1 or G2/M phases (Figure 5A and C).
However, Rad51 signal appeared in damaged MN in late S phase and was maintained in G2/M phase (Figure 5B and C).
These observations indicate a separation of replication and homologous recombination activity in MN, which has been similarly described for the main nucleus [11].
Investigation of the interaction of macromolecules in a cell cycledependent manner This application integrates e.g., immunostaining of two proteins in the hiMAC procedure to determine their interaction or relationship in any cell cycle phase.
This application enabled us to follow the colocalization dynamics of DNA damage response proteins [8].
As an example, we analyzed the impact of decreased homologous recombination efficiency of Nbs1deleted MEFs [10] on colocalization of Rad51 and cH2AX throughout the unperturbed cell cycle.
Nbs1 deletion reduced spontaneous colocalization of Rad51 and cH2AX throughout S phase, but caused persistence of Rad51-cH2AX double positive foci in G2/M (Figure 6), indicating that homologous recombination activity is associated with unresolved replication damages in G2 phase [8].
The first two types of analysis can easily be applied to a defined cell sub-population, e.g., cells co-transfected with a fluorescence marker or a cell type expressing a specific lineage marker.
Combination with genetic modification and small molecule inhibitors renders hiMAC a powerful approach to obtain functional data.
hiMAC can be applied to virtually any proliferating adherent cells, which can incorporate the replication marker EdU into newly-synthesized DNA.

Here, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of hiMAC in comparison with potential alternative techniques, and point out the experimental limitations of this method.
Comparison with other methods The use of visually assessable cell cycle stage markers for IF microscopy is an alternative for the cell cycle profiling step of hiMAC [12].
These markers include thymidine analog A DAPI EdU EdU DAPI H2AX Rad51 B G1 Early Mid Late G2 S G1 Early Mid Late G2 S Figure 5 hiMAC analysis of replication and recombination in micronu MEF cells with inducible deletion of Nbs1 (5 DPO) were stained with c images of EdU signal in micronuclei (MN).

In addition, cell cycle staging by IF microscopy of visually-assessable markers requires four channels (e.g., DAPI/RPA/CENP-F/pH3) in contrast to two channels by hiMAC.
This renders inclusion of complex analysis parameters such as protein interactions almost impossible technically.
In comparison with hiMAC, cell synchronization approaches also allow cell cycle stage-specific biochemical analyses [13].
An efficient synchronization-release experiment circumvents the use of cell cycle markers and thus increases flexibility of imaging analysis.
The disadvantages of such approaches are the high cell type dependence of synchronization efficiency and population homogeneity after release [13].
The population impurity caused by de-synchronization must be taken into account in the interpretation of results.
hiMAC avoids resulting artifacts by allowing analysis of a stringentlydefined cell cycle stage.
Importantly, most synchronization protocols rely on either chemical drugs that target cell cycle regulators or the withdrawal of nutrients from the culture, all of which causes unphysiological challenges for cells and may therefore generate artifacts, particularly when analyzing processes related to cell cycle progression.
Such stresses include replication fork damage by thymidine block and genomic instability by spindle poisoning.
Data obtained from a single synchronization method can thus be strongly influenced by recovery from cell synchronization, which is circumvented in hiMAC by analysis of non-synchronized cells [14].
DAPI/EdU flow cytometry [15] is a good alternative to hiMAC for cell cycle profiling and can be combined with the measurement of whole-cell fluorescence intensities; however, it lacks the spatial resolution required for the analysis of subcellular structures.
Microscopic analysis of cells immobilized after sorting by flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry [16], and combination of flow cytometry with cell fractionation [17] are potential alternatives to hiMAC in particular for simple readouts such as overall protein levels.
The major benefit of these approaches when compared with hiMAC is the high throughput achieved by integrating flow cytometry.
However, these methods require detachment of adherent cells from the culture vessel, which often triggers stress responses and alteration of cell morphology and eventually precludes cell treatments with short kinetics.
hiMAC is, in comparison, a relatively non-invasive approach.
Overall, hiMAC allows quantitative, statistically-powerful analysis of cell cycle phase-dependent cellular properties under physiological conditions in a large number of samples in a high-throughput format.
Limitations and other considerations Since hiMAC is a microscopy-based approach, it suffers the same limitations as immunofluorescence microscopy in general, including a dependence on suitable antibodies and spatial resolution.
hiMAC analysis is most efficient when images are acquired with a high-content analysis microscope, which facilitates comparable exposure times between images, low sample bleaching and low hands-on time.
For a small number of samples, our pipeline is compatible with manual image acquisition, but constant exposure durations in all channels are absolutely required for the generation of high-quality data.
The distinction between G0/G1 (2 N) and G2 (4 N) cells by hiMAC is based on DNA content.
Some treatments can induce G0/G1 cells with 4 N chromosomes, e.g., as a consequence of endoreduplication or defective chromosome separation during mitosis.
Combination of hiMAC with immunostaining of a G2-phase marker (CENP-F or cyclin B) can be used in a pilot experiment to assess the relevance of this potential artifact.
Conventional copper-catalyzed click chemistry quenches expressed fluorophores such as GFP.
However, it is possible to restore the fluorescence by using an antibody directed against GFP.
It is conceivable that novel click chemistry approaches to preserve GFP fluorescence will circumvent this technical issue.
In summary, we demonstrated that hiMAC is a versatile method to study DNA damage sources, pathway activities within subcellular organelles and protein colocalization patterns in a cell cycle phase-dependent manner.
Its statistical power and high-throughput compatibility render hiMAC a Bruhn C et al/ High-content Microscopy-assisted Cell Cycle Phenotyping hiMAC 261 useful approach for imaging analysis.
It is conceivable that hiMAC will be applied for genome-wide screenings to identify factors involved in cell cycle phase-dependent processes.

Microscopy setup (TIMING: 1 h) 24.
Select any microscope for automated image acquisition.
CRITICAL STEP Confocal microscopy facilitates the resolution of small, non-planar structures such as protein foci and may thus strongly improve automated object recognition and reliable quantification.
Use non-confocal fluorescence microscopy instead of confocal microscopy if possible (e.g., for pure cell cycle profiling) as confocal imaging strongly increases acquisition durations.
Homogeneous illumination of the optical field is crucial.
25.
Select an objective with a suitable magnification to resolve the desired structural information (10 for cell cycle profiling; 20 for large nuclear foci and 40 for small nuclear foci).
26.
Optimize the exposure time for each channel to obtain high signal intensities while avoiding signal saturation.
CRITICAL STEP Clearly positive cells from the sample with the strongest stainingmust be used for exposure time optimization to avoid signal saturation.
These are mitotic cells for the DAPI channel and mid-to-late S-phase cells for the EdU channel from an untreated asynchronous cell population.
TROUBLESHOOTING 27.
Optimize the optical auto-focus function for the DAPI channel, starting from 5 focusing steps with a step distance of 1 lM.
TROUBLESHOOTING 28.
Determine the z offset of each channel, which is the distance between a perfectly-focused image of the respective channel and the z position of the DAPI channel obtained by auto-focusing.
29.
Optional: Optimize the settings for all confocal channels (number of z-stacks, distance between z-stacks) for highest detail resolution, starting from 4 stacks with a stack thickness of 1 lM.
30.
Set up an image acquisition assay: In each optical field, auto-focus on the DAPI channel and record all channels, taking into account the z offsets determined above.
Record at least 1000 nuclei per sample.

For manual data analysis, refer to the documentation of the technical background of the hiMAC analysis file (File S1).
Troubleshooting High quality image acquisition is essential for the generation of hiMAC profiles.
Potential problem sources during image acquisition are sub-optimal auto-focusing, definition of incorrect distances between focus planes of the selected color channels, inhomogeneous illumination of the optical field, overexposure, and insufficient compensation of the chromatic aberration between different color channels by the microscope hardware, which may lead to a small distortion of images in different color channels.
To ensure optimal image quality, we advise to prepare samples in thin-bottom 96-well dishes instead of coverslips, carefully optimize the autofocus function, measure the distance between optimal focus planes of different channels, and determine the dynamic range of exposure durations for several samples.
Distortion of images recorded in different color channels can be compensated for by including additional modules in the CellProfiler analysis pipeline.
Detailed troubleshooting advice can be found in Table 2.
