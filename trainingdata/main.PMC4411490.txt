The investigation of cellular processes in a cell cycle stage-dependent manner is often the subject of modern molecular and cell biological research.
Cell cycle synchronization and immunostaining of cell cycle markers facilitate such analysis, but are limited in use due to unphysiological experimental stress, cell type dependence and often low ﬂexibility.
Here, we describe high-content microscopy-assisted cell cycle phenotyping (hiMAC), which integrates high-resolution cell cycle proﬁling of asynchronous cell populations with immunoﬂuorescence microscopy.
hiMAC is compatible with cell types from any species and allows for statistically pow- erful, unbiased, simultaneous analysis of protein interactions, modiﬁcations and subcellular locali- zation at all cell cycle stages within a single sample.
For illustration, we provide a hiMAC analysis pipeline tailored to study DNA damage response and genomic instability using a 3 4-day protocol, which can be adjusted to any other cell cycle stage-dependent analysis.

Synchronization protocols are often used to investigate cell cycle-dependent biological processes in mammalian cells in a given experimental setting  however, these are problematic because they load experimental stresses.
Immunoﬂuorescence (IF) imaging facilitates cell cycle staging and cell phenotyping, but a combination of both strongly restricts analysis ﬂexibility due to the limitations of ﬂuorescence channels and antibodies, which precludes powerful applications such as cell cycle-based colocalization analysis.
Live cell imaging of ﬂuorophore-tagged cell cycle markers has been used to monitor cell cycle progression in unsynchronized cell populations, but it requires stable protein overexpression and is limited in the use of additional markers.
In order to overcome these challenges, we developed hiMAC, which integrates two-color (DAPI/EdU) cell cycle proﬁling and the analysis of complex cell phenotypes in a sin- gle high-content microscopy pipeline.
hiMAC provides an unbiased method for cell cycle stage-dependent analysis of pro- tein localization, interactions, structural features and pathway activities with a high statistical power, which ultimately pro- vide cell cycle-based ﬁngerprints for many biological processes accessible by IF imaging.
Overview of hiMAC  The hiMAC methodology enables the analysis of localization and modiﬁcation dynamics of multiple proteins simultaneously in all cell cycle phases of non-synchronized cells.
It consists of the integrated analysis of the cell cycle and any cell features of interest by high-content ﬂuorescence microscopy.
It can pro- cess a large number of samples, which is necessary for setups with multiple treatment conditions and time points.
High-res- olution cell cycle information is derived from DNA content (DAPI) and replication status (e.g., incorporation of thymi- dine analog EdU), which confers species-independence and maximum ﬂexibility in the choice of proteins to analyze.
Figure 1 illustrates the hiMAC workﬂow.
A detailed step- by-step description is provided in the   Procedure   section.
Figure 2 exempliﬁes the hiMAC procedure for the co-local- ization analysis of two DNA damage markers, recombination marker Rad51 and general DNA damage marker cH2AX, throughout the cell cycle in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs).
DNA lesions were induced by deletion of the DNA damage response gene Nbs1 as veriﬁed by the immunoblotting (Figure 2A).
The hiMAC protocol begins with pulse labeling of cells with EdU, followed by ﬁxation and permeabilization (Figure 1).
A click reaction is performed to label S-phase cells [6], and proteins of interest and DNA are labeled with immu- nostaining and DAPI, respectively.
Images are recorded by automated microscopy (Figure 2B) and analyzed in a custom- ized CellProﬁler [7] pipeline to measure intensities of DAPI (DNA content and condensation) and of EdU (replication sta- tus) in individual nuclei, and to identify the pattern of objects of interest, such as proteins, organelles and micronuclei (Fig- ure 2C).
Finally, a cell cycle proﬁle is constructed, cell cycle phases are gated (Figure 2D and E), and the objects of interest are analyzed for all individual cell cycle phases (G1, early/mid/ late S and G2/M) (Figure 2F).
While hiMAC can be used to study cell cycle-dependent phenomena in general, here we speciﬁcally provide a pipeline  Steps 1 7: Cell treatment  (EdU pulse, fixation)  Steps 8 23: Sample preparation  (click reaction, immunostaining, DAPI)  Steps 24 31: Image acquisition  Steps 32 37: Image analysis  (object recognition, densitometry)  Steps 38 40: Data analysis in   hiMAC template  (cell cycle profiling, phenotyping)  hiMAC workﬂow  Figure 1 The general experimental steps of the hiMAC procedure is outlined, see detailed stepwise description in the   Procedure   section.
to analyze the cell cycle phase-dependent localization of any two proteins and their interaction within the nucleus.
We suc- cessfully applied this pipeline to analyze the dynamic localiza- tion of DNA damage response proteins (53BP1, Rad51, cH2AX, etc.)
throughout the cell cycle [8].
Experimental design  Several parameters should be considered in the hiMAC proto- col according to the experimental purpose.
EdU pulse labeling is compatible with many cell treatments.
However, EdU fails to label S-phase cells under conditions that block DNA synthe- sis (e.g., by hydroxyurea)  the EdU pulse thus needs to be applied before such a treatment.
It is recommended to include one sample of asynchronous untreated cells as undisturbed cell cycle control in every experiment.
Positive and negative con- trol samples should be included for each post-translational modiﬁcation to assess maximum signal induction.
When quan- tifying the level and localization of an ectopically expressed protein, appropriate controls such as non-functional or non- degradable isoforms of the same protein, or a different protein with the same tag and similar localization should be included.
The cell ﬁxation and immunostaining methods for high anti- body speciﬁcity need to be optimized before high-throughput analysis [9].
siRNA knock-down of the protein epitope of interest is a good control for antibody speciﬁcity.
While non- confocal microscopy is sufﬁcient for hiMAC cell cycle proﬁl- ing, confocal image acquisition may be of greater advantage for the resolution of ﬁne structures of interest (nuclear foci, mitochondria, etc.).
Results  Cell cycle proﬁling  Cell cycle proﬁling of an asynchronous population of MEF cells yielded cell cycle proﬁles with clear separation of G1, S and G2/M populations (Figure 2E, left panel).

followed by sequential passage of cells through early/mid/late S phase into G2/M phase (Figure 3A).
In asynchronous MEF cells, the use of the S-phase population (EdU+) as a reference for cells with low DNA condensation allowed separation of G2/M cells (4 N, EdU ) into early G2 and late G2/M cells on the basis of mean DAPI intensity by hiMAC (Figure 3B and C).
Co-staining with mitosis marker phospho-histone H3 (S28) (p-H3) showed that indeed most late G2/M nuclei were p-H3 positive (Figure 3B,  84%), demonstrating that DNA condensation within the G2/M population can be used as mar- ker for late G2/M phases.
Altogether, hiMAC facilitates gating  of G1, early/mid/late S and early G2, as well as late G2/M populations.
Application of hiMAC to different cell cycle phase-dependent analyses  We have used hiMAC in three major applications, namely, the cell cycle phase-dependent analysis of DNA damage sources, pathway activities within subcellular organelles and colocaliza- tion pattern.

The lower panel shows cell cycle proﬁles.
The DAPI intensity of the G1 population at 28 h after release was used as reference for DNA content.
Note that DAPI and EdU labeling allows to monitor the progression of released cells through S phase.
B. and C. Validation of DNA condensation as mitosis marker.
Asynchronous MEF cells were pulse labeled with EdU, stained with DAPI, EdU and a phospho-histone H3 (S28) (p-H3) antibody as mitosis marker and analyzed by hiMAC.
S cells (red dots) were used as internal reference with low DNA condensation to set a DAPI mean threshold for the classiﬁcation of G2/M cells (green dots) as either early G2 (low DNA condensation) or late G2/M (high DNA condensation) cells (B).
p-H3 vs. DAPI mean scatter plots conﬁrm that high DNA condensation in G2/M correlates well with p-H3 (right panel), whereas S cells have low DNA condensation and are p-H3 negative (left panel) (C).

Investigation of the cell cycle dependence of pathway activities  For this application, a microscopy-based readout for pathway activity is integrated into the hiMAC procedure.
Such readout typically relies on the immunostaining of either reaction prod- ucts or pathway components to reveal their subcellular locali- zation or modiﬁcation.
We used his application to demonstrate the activation of speciﬁc DNA damage responses in G2-phase cells after the deletion of Nbs1 [8].
This application can also be used to measure cell cycle phase-dependent pathway activities under unperturbed conditions or in response to experimental treatments (genotoxic agents, inhibitors, gene deletions, etc.).
As an example shown in Figure 4, we investigated the kinetics of cH2AX foci as a general DNA damage marker in the response of wild-type MEFs to DNA polymerase inhibitor, aphidicolin (Aph), at 200 nM, a concentration that permits replication at a reduced rate (Figure 4A).
As expected, hiMAC analysis revealed accumulation of S-phase cells (Figure 4B), reduction of EdU incorporation (Figure 4C) and induction of cH2AX foci in early/mid/late S phase (Figure 4D F), sug- gesting that DNA damage was highly speciﬁc to S phase and associated with impaired DNA replication.
Investigation of the origin and fate of subcellular structures  In this application, a hiMAC time course is recorded after a speciﬁc treatment, such as chemical inhibitor treatment, gene deletion or knock-down by siRNA.
hiMAC maps the cell cycle phase in which the structure of interest ﬁrst appears.
Analysis of the following time points then traces the structural changes during cell cycle progression.
We have used this application to reveal the origin and progression of endogenous DNA dam- ages and micronuclei (MN) in Nbs1-deleted cells [8].
For exam- ple, we assessed replication and homologous recombination activity in MN in Nbs1-deleted MEF cells [10] by quantifying EdU incorporation in all MN and Rad51 localization to dam- aged (cH2AX+) MN, respectively.
As expected, replication occurred in MN in early/mid/late S phase but not in G1 or  G2/M phases (Figure 5A and C).
However, Rad51 signal appeared in damaged MN in late S phase and was maintained in G2/M phase (Figure 5B and C).
These observations indicate a separation of replication and homologous recombination activity in MN, which has been similarly described for the main nucleus [11].
Investigation of the interaction of macromolecules in a cell cycle- dependent manner  This application integrates e.g., immunostaining of two pro- teins in the hiMAC procedure to determine their interaction or relationship in any cell cycle phase.
This application enabled us to follow the colocalization dynamics of DNA damage response proteins [8].
As an example, we analyzed the impact of decreased homologous recombination efﬁciency of Nbs1- deleted MEFs [10] on colocalization of Rad51 and cH2AX throughout the unperturbed cell cycle.
Nbs1 deletion reduced spontaneous colocalization of Rad51 and cH2AX throughout S phase, but caused persistence of Rad51-cH2AX double posi- tive foci indicating that homologous recombination activity is associated with unresolved replica- tion damages in G2 phase [8].
in G2/M (Figure 6),  The ﬁrst two types of analysis can easily be applied to a deﬁned cell sub-population, e.g., cells co-transfected with a ﬂuorescence marker or a cell type expressing a speciﬁc lineage marker.
Combination with genetic modiﬁcation and small molecule inhibitors renders hiMAC a powerful approach to obtain functional data.
hiMAC can be applied to virtually any proliferating adherent cells, which can incorporate the rep- lication marker EdU into newly-synthesized DNA.

Here, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of hiMAC in comparison with potential alternative techniques, and point out the experimental limitations of this method.
Comparison with other methods  The use of visually assessable cell cycle stage markers for IF microscopy is an alternative for the cell cycle proﬁling step of hiMAC [12].
These markers include thymidine analog  incorporation during replication (BrdU, EdU) and replica- tion-associated proteins such as proliferating nuclear cell anti- gen (PCNA) and replication protein A (RPA) for S phase, cyclin B and kinetochore-associated proteins like centromere protein F (CENP-F) for G2 phase, and histone modiﬁcations like phospho-histone H3(pH3) for M phase.
However, cell cycle staging by this approach depends on a combination of antibodies, which therefore restricts species compatibility and often leads to cross reactions with the antibodies that are used  G1  Early  G1  Early  S  Mid  S  Mid  Late  G2  Late  G2  A   DAPI EdU   B   EdU   DAPI γH2AX Rad51   C   s  l l  e c + N M    l l  a     n  i    N M  + r e k r a M %     ***  **  EdU Rad51 / γH2AX  50  40  30  20  10  0  S   hiMAC analysis of replication and recombination in micronuclei  Figure 5 MEF cells with inducible deletion of Nbs1 (5 DPO) were stained with cH2AX and Rad51 antibodies, EdU and DAPI.

for the phenotype readout.
In addition, cell cycle staging by IF microscopy of visually-assessable markers requires four chan- nels (e.g., DAPI/RPA/CENP-F/pH3) in contrast to two chan- nels by hiMAC.
This renders inclusion of complex analysis parameters such as protein interactions almost impossible technically.
In  cell  hiMAC,  comparison with  synchronization approaches also allow cell cycle stage-speciﬁc biochemical analyses [13].
An efﬁcient synchronization-release experiment circumvents the use of cell cycle markers and thus increases ﬂexibility of imaging analysis.
The disadvantages of such approaches are the high cell type dependence of synchroniza- tion efﬁciency and population homogeneity after release [13].
The population impurity caused by de-synchronization must be taken into account in the interpretation of results.
hiMAC avoids resulting artifacts by allowing analysis of a stringently- deﬁned cell cycle stage.
Importantly, most synchronization protocols rely on either chemical drugs that target cell cycle regulators or the withdrawal of nutrients from the culture, all of which causes unphysiological challenges for cells and may therefore generate artifacts, particularly when analyzing processes related to cell cycle progression.
Such stresses include replication fork damage by thymidine block and genomic instability by spindle poisoning.
Data obtained from a single synchronization method can thus be strongly inﬂuenced by recovery from cell synchronization, which is circumvented in hiMAC by analysis of non-synchronized cells [14].
DAPI/EdU ﬂow cytometry [15] is a good alternative to hiMAC for cell cycle proﬁling and can be combined with the measurement of whole-cell ﬂuorescence intensities  however, it lacks the spatial resolution required for the analysis of sub- cellular structures.
Microscopic analysis of cells immobilized after sorting by ﬂow cytometry, imaging ﬂow cytometry [16], and combination of ﬂow cytometry with cell fractionation [17] are potential alternatives to hiMAC in particular for sim- ple readouts such as overall protein levels.
The major beneﬁt of these approaches when compared with hiMAC is the high throughput achieved by integrating ﬂow cytometry.
However, these methods require detachment of adherent cells from the culture vessel, which often triggers stress responses and  alteration of cell morphology and eventually precludes cell treatments with short kinetics.
hiMAC is, in comparison, a rel- atively non-invasive approach.
Overall, hiMAC allows quantitative, statistically-powerful analysis of cell cycle phase-dependent cellular properties under physiological conditions in a large number of samples in a high-throughput format.
Limitations and other considerations  Since hiMAC is a microscopy-based approach, it suffers the same limitations as immunoﬂuorescence microscopy in gen- eral, including a dependence on suitable antibodies and spatial resolution.
hiMAC analysis is most efﬁcient when images are acquired with a high-content analysis microscope, which facilitates com- parable exposure times between images, low sample bleaching and low hands-on time.
For a small number of samples, our pipeline is compatible with manual image acquisition, but con- stant exposure durations in all channels are absolutely required for the generation of high-quality data.
The distinction between G0/G1 (2 N) and G2 (4 N) cells by hiMAC is based on DNA content.
Some treatments can induce G0/G1 cells with 4 N chromosomes, e.g., as a consequence of endoreduplication or defective chromosome separation during mitosis.
Combination of hiMAC with immunostaining of a G2-phase marker (CENP-F or cyclin B) can be used in a pilot experiment to assess the relevance of this potential artifact.
Conventional copper-catalyzed click chemistry quenches expressed ﬂuorophores such as GFP.
However, it is possible to restore the ﬂuorescence by using an antibody directed against GFP.
It is conceivable that novel click chemistry approaches to preserve GFP ﬂuorescence will circumvent this technical issue.
In summary, we demonstrated that hiMAC is a versatile method to study DNA damage sources, pathway activities within subcellular organelles and protein colocalization patterns in a cell cycle phase-dependent manner.
Its statistical power and high-throughput compatibility render hiMAC a   Bruhn C et al / High-content Microscopy-assisted Cell Cycle Phenotyping    hiMAC  261  useful approach for imaging analysis.
It is conceivable that hiMAC will be applied for genome-wide screenings to identify factors involved in cell cycle phase-dependent processes.

262  Procedure  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 12 (2014) 255 265  This procedure describes the handling of cells on thin-bottom 96-well dishes.
For the use of 12 mm diameter coverslips, scale up the culture volumes proportionally to the corresponding culture vessel, but use the indicated volumes for blocking solu- tion, antibody solution, click reaction cocktail and DAPI staining solution.
Embed coverslips in DAPI-free mounting medium before microscopy.
While any adherent cell type can be used, we describe a protocol optimized for the analysis of Rad51 and cH2AX foci during cell cycle progression in MEFs with the inducible deletion of Nbs1 as presented in Figure 2.

Microscopy setup (TIMING: 1 h)  24.
Select any microscope for automated image acquisi-  tion.
CRITICAL STEP Confocal microscopy facilitates the resolution of small, non-planar structures such as pro- tein foci and may thus strongly improve automated object recognition and reliable quantiﬁcation.
Use non-confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy instead of con- focal microscopy if possible (e.g., for pure cell cycle proﬁling) as confocal imaging strongly increases acqui- sition durations.
Homogeneous illumination of the optical ﬁeld is crucial.
25.
Select an objective with a suitable magniﬁcation to resolve the desired structural information (10   for cell cycle proﬁling  20   for large nuclear foci and 40   for small nuclear foci).
26.
Optimize the exposure time for each channel to obtain  high signal intensities while avoiding signal saturation.
CRITICAL STEP Clearly positive cells from the sample with the strongest staining must be used for exposure time optimization to avoid signal saturation.
These are mitotic cells for the DAPI channel and mid-to-late S-phase cells for the EdU channel from an untreated asynchronous cell population.
TROUBLESHOOTING  27.
Optimize the optical auto-focus function for the DAPI channel, starting from 5 focusing steps with a step dis- tance of 1 lM.
TROUBLESHOOTING  28.
Determine the z offset of each channel, which is the dis- tance between a perfectly-focused image of the respec- tive channel and the z position of the DAPI channel obtained by auto-focusing.
29.
Optional: Optimize the settings for all confocal channels (number of z-stacks, distance between z-stacks) for high- est detail resolution, starting from 4 stacks with a stack thickness of 1 lM.
30.
Set up an image acquisition assay: In each optical ﬁeld, auto-focus on the DAPI channel and record all channels, taking into account the z offsets determined above.
Record at least 1000 nuclei per sample.

34.
Open the CellProﬁler software.
35.
Open a CellProﬁler pipeline (File S3) according to the  desired type of analysis as summarized in Table 1.
36.
Using the positive control image set from step 33, opti- mize parameters in the CellProﬁler pipeline by following the optimization guideline (File S1).
TROUBLESHOOTING  High quality image acquisition is essential for the generation of hiMAC proﬁles.
Potential problem sources during image acquisition are sub-optimal auto-focusing, deﬁnition of incor- rect distances between focus planes of the selected color channels, inhomogeneous illumination of the optical ﬁeld, overexposure, and insufﬁcient compensation of the chromatic aberration between different color channels by the micro- scope hardware, which may lead to a small distortion of images in different color channels.
To ensure optimal image quality, we advise to prepare samples in thin-bottom 96-well dishes instead of coverslips, carefully optimize the autofocus function, measure the distance between optimal focus planes of different channels, and determine the dynamic range of exposure durations for several samples.
Distortion of images recorded in different color channels can be compensated for by including additional modules in the CellProﬁler analysis pipeline.
Detailed troubleshooting advice can be found in Table 2.
