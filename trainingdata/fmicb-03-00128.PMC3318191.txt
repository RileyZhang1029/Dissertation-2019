Substitutions at the receptor-binding site of the pandemic H1N1 2009 inﬂuenza A virus
(H1N1pdm) hemagglutinin (HA) gene may be critical in determining whether a virus binds
to human or avian receptors. Previous reports suggest that HA Gly222 and/or Arg223 allow
viruses to bind preferentially to the α2,3-linked sialic acid found in avian species. We also
demonstrated that serial passaging of inﬂuenza A virus in embryonated chicken eggs
increased viral growth 32- to 64-fold, coincident with the increased prevalence of Gly222 or
Arg223 in HA protein (Yasugi et al., 2012). In this study, we showed that the minor genotype
of α2,3-linkage-tropic viruses in upper airways became dominant after passaging through
chicken eggs. Viruses possessing HA containing N125D-Q223R, N125D-D187E-Q223R,
K119N-D222G, and K119N-N129S-D222G, were detected in both clinical specimens and
egg-passaged samples. These results might suggest that egg-adapted viruses, likely rep-
resented by α2,3-linkage-tropic virus, were also present in human upper airways as a minor
population and transmitted in humans during the outbreak of H1N1pdm.

INTRODUCTION
Eight segments of a novel swine-derived H1N1 2009 inﬂuenza
A virus (H1N1pdm) genome are derived from classical North
American and Eurasian swine lineages, an avian lineage, and from
human H3N2. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene is thought to be
derived from classical North American swine (Cohen, 2009). The
receptor-binding speciﬁcity of HA is responsible for the host range
restriction of inﬂuenza A virus. Human and classical H1N1 swine
inﬂuenza viruses bind preferentially to the glycosylated sialic acid
(SA) linkage α2,6Gal, whereas most avian viruses have higher
binding afﬁnity for SAα2,3Gal (Nicholls et al., 2008). Receptor
speciﬁcity is determined by the nature of the amino acids that
form the receptor-binding pocket of HA. Gln at position 223
and Gly at position 225 found in avian virus isolates determine
the speciﬁcity for SAα2,3Gal (Stevens et al., 2004), whereas Leu
and Ser at these positions confer SAα2,6Gal speciﬁcity in H2 and
H3 viruses (Gamblin et al., 2004). For H1 viruses, Asp (found in
human viruses) or Glu (found in avian viruses) at position 187
determine preferential binding to α2,6 or α2,3 linkages, respec-
tively (Gambaryan et al., 1999). The amino acids at positions 135,
191, and 222 also affect receptor-binding afﬁnity and speciﬁcity

(Rogers et al., 1983; Vines et al., 1998; Matrosovich et al., 2000;
Chen et al., 2010).

Since the ﬁrst appearance of H1N1pdm viruses, substitutions
including D222G in HA protein and the K340N substitution in
RNA polymerase basic 2 (PB2) have appeared sporadically (WHO
Global Alert and Responses, 2009). We investigated the nucleotide
diversity of the 2009 H1N1pdm HA gene during the ﬁrst (May
2009) and second (Dec 2010) waves of the epidemic in Japan, with
particular focus on the receptor-binding site (RBS). Sequencing
analyses using conventional and next-generation high-throughput
approaches showed that there were quasispecies in the HA genome,
including D222G, in humans (Yasugi et al., 2012). In this study, we
focused on the shift of genotype(s) of α2,3-linkage-tropic viruses
in upper airways to become dominant after passaging through
chicken eggs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

and ﬁve samples (#1 to #3: ﬁrst wave in May 2009 and #4 to #8: sec-
ond wave in December 2010, respectively) were randomly selected
(Yasugi et al., 2012). The analyzed samples were unlinked and
anonymous at Osaka Prefectural Institute of Public Health. This
study was approved by the ethics review committees of Osaka Pre-
fectural Institute of Public Health and the Research Institute for
Microbial Diseases (RIMD; Yasugi et al., 2012), Osaka University.
Both ethics committees speciﬁcally waived the need for consent.

RNA EXTRACTION
Each nasal swab collected in Hanks solution was centrifuged at
20,000× g for 10 min. The supernatants were suspended in TRI-
zol LS reagent (Invitrogen) for 60 min. Total RNA was extracted
with a PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Contaminating DNA was eliminated with
DNAase I (Invitrogen).

DIRECT SEQUENCING
Total RNA was subjected to one-step RT-PCR (SuperScript
III/Platinum Taq One-step RT-PCR Kit; Invitrogen). Primer sets
used to amplify each viral genome segment are shown in Table A1
in Appendix. PCR products were puriﬁed using a MonoFas DNA
puriﬁcation kit (GL Sciences) and nucleotide sequences were
obtained using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems).

VIRUS ISOLATION AND SERIAL PASSAGE IN EMBRYONATED EGGS AND
MADIN–DARBY CANINE KIDNEY CELLS
Clinical specimens were injected into 9-day-old embryonated
chicken eggs for virus isolation (Daidoji et al., 2008). After incu-
bation at 37˚C for 72 h, the allantoic ﬂuids were collected and
ﬁltered (Passage 0: P0). The samples were then diluted 1- to 100-
fold in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and passaged either ﬁve
(#3) or six times (#1, #2, and #4 to #8) in embryonated chicken
eggs. Identical specimens derived from #1 to #2 were also inocu-
lated into MDCK cells for virus isolation (Ueda et al., 2010) and
the ampliﬁed viruses were serially passaged two or three times in
MDCK cells.

HEMAGGLUTINATION TITRATION
Viral samples were serially diluted with PBS and added at a con-
centration of 0.5% to chicken red blood cells. After incubation at
room temperature for 30 min, hemagglutination was observed.

HIGH-THROUGHPUT PYROSEQUENCING ANALYSIS
Total RNA was subjected to one-step RT-PCR using the primer
set for HA-RBS (Yasugi et al., 2012). A total of 6 μg ampliﬁed
DNA was subjected to high-throughput pyrosequencing analysis
(Roche/454 GS-FLX Titanium system). A 70× 75 PicoTiterPlate
device (gasket for 16 regions) was divided into 16 regions and
one region was used for the mixed samples. Data analysis was
performed on each sequence read using computational tools as
described previously (Nakamura et al., 2008, 2009).

RESULTS
The genotype of the egg-passaged viruses (P5 in #3 or P6 in
#1 and #2) derived from the ﬁrst wave was analyzed. Amplicons

representing each segment of the P5 and P6 viral genomes were
PCR ampliﬁed with gene-speciﬁc primers (Table A1 in Appendix)
and the nucleotide sequence of each PCR product was directly
determined by traditional sequencing. No amino acid substitu-
tions were detected in the PB2, RNA polymerase basic 1 (PB1
and PB1-F2), RNA polymerase acidic (PA), neuraminidase (NA),
matrix proteins (M1 and M2), and non-structural proteins (NS1
and NS2) compared with A/Osaka/01/2009 (Table 1; Yasugi et al.,
2012). Passaged 1- and 3-derived viruses exhibited one amino
acid mutation in the nucleoprotein (NP), but not at the same site
(Table 1), suggesting that the mutation was not directly correlated
to egg adaptation. In contrast, several mutations (E66K, K119N,
N125D, D222G, Q223R, and N370K) in the HA were detected and
K119N, D222G, and Q223R were abundant substitutions in multi-
ple specimen-derived viruses (Table 1). The sequencing data also
showed that D222G and/or Q223R substitutions became domi-
nant in the population of egg-passaged viruses, suggesting that
the shift in HA genotype contributed to the adaptation of the
passaged viruses to avian cells.

We performed high-throughput sequencing analysis by GS-
FLX Titanium pyrosequencing. PCR products amplifying the same
region (HA-RBS) as shown previously (Yasugi et al., 2012), which
covers almost all the above mutations, except E66K and N370K,
were prepared from egg-passaged viruses P1 and P5 or P6. The sub-
stitution rate of six critical amino acids (K119N, N125D, N129S,
D187E, D222G, Q223R; Yasugi et al., 2012) and A215V is sum-
marized in Tables 2–4. Viruses passaged ﬁve or six times in eggs
(P5, P6) showed higher mutation rates than the parental viruses
isolated from clinical specimens. HA sequences harboring N125D,

the #2-P6 viruses (Table 3), and K119N, N125D, N129S, A215V,
and D222G mutations found in the #3-P5 viruses predominated
(Table 4). The N125D-Q223R (76%) genotype derived from #1
and K119N-N129S-D222G (45.5%), and N125D-D187E-Q223R
(21.8%) genotypes derived from #2 and K119N-A215V-D222G
(39%), N125D-D222G (17%), and N125D-N129S-D222G (11%)
genotypes derived from #3 were also detected as major popula-
tions (Tables 2–4). The shift in HA genotype through passaging in
eggs is assessed in Figure 1. Of particular interest, sequences con-
taining double and/or triple amino acid mutations, which were
abundantly detected in egg-passaged viruses, were also found as
a minor population in its nasal specimen. For example, HA har-
boring N125D-D187E-Q223R (Table 2; Figure 1), K119N-N129S-
D222G and N125D-Q223R (Table 3; Figure 1), or K119N-D222G
(Table 4) was detected in #1, #2, and #3 clinical samples (Yasugi

et al., 2012), respectively. These results suggest that egg-adapted
viruses, likely represented by α2,3-linkage-tropic virus, were also
present in human upper airways as a minor population and trans-
mitted in humans during the outbreak of H1N1pdm. Because
2,6Gal expression is abundant and 2,3Gal expression is minor in
epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tracts (Shinya et al., 2006), it
might make sense that α2,3-linkage-tropic viruses exist as a minor
population in human upper airways.

In contrast to the ﬁrst wave, both the G222 and R223 variants
had almost disappeared (0.01–0.07 and 0.47–0.63%, respectively)
in ﬁve nasal swabs (#4 to #8) obtained from individuals with a
mild case of H1N1pdm in December 2010 (second wave; Yasugi
et al., 2012). We then inoculated the ﬁve specimens (#4 to #8) into
embryonated chicken eggs and serially passaged them six times
in eggs. Hemagglutination was faintly detected in samples in the

ﬁrst passage (P0) but was detected in the third or fourth passage
and showed 25–27 hemagglutination titers in the ﬁfth or sixth pas-
sage (P5 or P6) in the four specimens except #8 (Table 5). PCR
products amplifying the same region as #1 to #3 (ﬁrst wave; Yasugi
et al., 2012) were prepared and were examined using conventional
direct PCR sequencing. The G222 (#4, #6) and R223 (#5 and #7)
variants were detected even in P1 passages in the four specimens
(Table 6), although both variants had very minor populations in
nasal specimens. In addition, no other variants, except the above
two amino acids, were detected (data not shown); thus, further
high-throughput sequencing analysis was not performed in #4
to #8.

DISCUSSION
Previous work demonstrated that D222G and/or Q223R muta-
tion led to the binding of α2,3-SA-resialylated chicken red
blood cells (Chen et al., 2010). D222G and/or Q223R muta-
tions might also be crucial for the tropism and/or pathogen-
esis of H1N1pdm. The function(s) of the other substitutions
shown in Tables 2–4 are largely unknown; however, signiﬁ-
cant similarities in the HA genotype between the viruses res-
ident in upper airways (Yasugi et al., 2012) and egg-adapted
viruses (Tables 2–4) suggest that the minor genotype of α2,3-
linkage-tropic viruses in upper airways became dominant after
passaging through chicken eggs. Viruses derived from #1 and

clinical specimens and egg-passaged samples (Figure 1; Yasugi
et al., 2012). These results suggest a direct linkage of α2,3-tropic
viruses between the clinical samples and egg-adapted samples in
each case.

However, such a direct linkage could not be observed in the
second wave of H1N1pdm, because the G222 and R223 variants
were almost undetected (0.01–0.07 and 0.47–0.63%, respectively)
in ﬁve nasal swabs (#4 to #8; Yasugi et al., 2012). Thus, D222G
or Q223R mutation may occur in inoculated eggs. Further inves-
tigations of clonal recombinant virus using reverse genetics are
required to address this question. We also failed to rescue egg-
adapted virus from #8 (Table 5). In addition, neither D222G nor
Q223R genotype was detected in the sixth passage of #4 (Table 6),
although egg-adapted viruses well grew (Table 5). These results
might suggest that factor(s) other than mutation(s) in HA-RBS
(Lu et al., 2005) are involved in egg adaptation.

We showed that MDCK-passaged virus isolates contain a sim-
ilar ratio of α2,3-tropic and α2,6-tropic viruses compared to

the original H1N1pdm (ﬁrst wave) viruses identiﬁed in human
specimens (Tables 2 and 3; Yasugi et al., 2012). Takemae et al.
(2010) demonstrated that embryonated chicken egg-isolated clas-
sical H1 swine inﬂuenza viruses harbored substitutions includ-
ing D187V/N and D222G in the HA, whereas MDCK isolates
retained HA genes identical to those of the viruses present
in the swine nasal swab samples. Passaging in MDCK cells
may therefore be a better approach to establish genetic diver-
sity and speciﬁc HA genotypes in vivo in human and swine
inﬂuenza viruses. While egg adaptation is currently required to
prepare vaccine candidates, alternative approaches involving the
use of accredited anchorage-dependent and -independent prepa-
rations of the African Green monkey kidney (Vero), MDCK, and
other cell lines have been pursued by several manufacturers in
recent years (Audsley and Tannock, 2008). Our results, in this
study, suggest the advantage of the cell-based inﬂuenza vaccine
approach, which is able to maintain the genetic stability of clinical
strains.

This study, together with our previous report (Yasugi et al.,
2012), suggest that α2,3-SA-speciﬁc viruses, including G222 and
R223, existed in humans as a minor population in the early phase
(ﬁrst wave) of the pandemic, and that D222 and Q223 became
more dominant through human-to-human transmission (second
wave) during the epidemic. Newly emergent inﬂuenza A viruses
may have been dual speciﬁc but not exclusively α2,6-SA-speciﬁc
during the early phase of the pandemic and adapted during
multiple cycles of human-to-human transmission (Yasugi et al.,
2012). Further investigation is required to determine the propor-
tion of α2,3-tropic and α2,6-tropic viruses found in tissues and
organs infected with other human-, avian-, and swine-derived
inﬂuenza viruses. Deep sequencing approaches will provide a
more comprehensive analysis of genetic diversity in egg- and
MDCK-passaged viruses and original virus isolates in vivo and
will help us to understand quasispecies of inﬂuenza viruses more
precisely.
