Most  fungi  possess  several  hydrogen  peroxide-generating  enzymes,  glucose  oxidase  and  pyranose  oxidase.  Pyranose  oxidase
can  use  glucose  as  its  substrate  to  generate  hydrogen  peroxide.  White  rot  fungi,  which  degrade  diverse  recalcitrant  com-
pounds,  contain  lignin-degrading  enzymes,  and  lignin  peroxidase  and  manganese  peroxidase  require  hydrogen  peroxide  for
their  enzymatic  reactions.  In  this  study,  we  isolated  a  cDNA  fragment  of  pyranose  oxidase  from  Phlebia  tremellosa  using
PCR  and  examined  its  expression  under  the  degradation  conditions  of  diethylphthalate  (DEP).  Pyranose  oxidase  expression
was  enhanced  up  to  30%  by  the  addition  of  DEP,  and  this  result  supports  the  possible  involvement  of  pyranose  oxidase
in  the  degradation  of  recalcitrant  compounds.

White  rot  fungi,  which  degrade  lignins,  possess  related
enzymes  such  as  laccase,  lignin  peroxidase  (LiP),  and
manganese  peroxidase  (MnP).  Since  these  enzymes  show
relatively  broad  substrate  specificities,  white  rot  fungi  can
degrade  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons,  explosives,  and
endocrine-disrupting chemicals. We have previously reported
the  degradation  of  explosives  [1]  and  endocrine-disrupt-
ing  chemicals  [2, 3].  We  have  also  cloned  the  genes  for
laccase  and  MnP  from  Phlebia  tremellosa  and  Trametes
versicolor  as  well  as  constructed  expression  vectors.  Genetic
transformants using the expression vectors have been gen-
erated, and they show enhanced degrading activities against
recalcitrant compounds [4-6].

Even  though  the  original  compounds  of  endocrine-dis-
rupting  chemicals  in  culture  supernatants  were  removed
up  to  90%  during  the  first  2~3  days,  there  were  30~40%
residual estrogenic activities in the culture supernatants. This
unbalanced  degradation  of  endocrine-disrupting  chemi-
cals  was  observed  in  the  wild  type  as  well  as  in  the
genetic transformants of laccase or MnP [4-6]. This result
implies  that  both  of  the  original  compounds  and  the  deg-
radation 
intermediates  possessed  estrogenic  activities.
Gartshore  et  al.  [7]  reported  that  the  degradation  interme-
diates  of  five  different  plasticizers  have  toxic  effects,  and
phthalates can be changed to have strong estrogenic activ-
ities by UV  irradiation [8]. These results also suggest that
even  though  the  original  compounds  were  almost  com-
pletely  removed,  the  degradation  intermediates  still  showed
estrogenic activities in our previous experiments.

LiP  and  MnP  require  hydrogen  peroxide  as  a  co-sub-
strate  in  their  enzymatic  reactions.  Glucose  oxidase  (EC

1.1.3.4)  catalyzes  the  oxidation  of  glucose  to  hydrogen
peroxide  and  glucono-δ-lactone.  Pyranose  oxidase  (EC
1.1.3.10;  POx)  is  another  enzyme  that  generates  hydro-
gen  peroxide;  it  produces  hydrogen  peroxide  and  2-dehy-
dro-glucose  and  therefore  has  another  name,  glucose  2-
oxidase. Since genetic transformants containing extra cop-
ies  of  laccase  or  MnP  cDNA  are  not  fully  satisfactory  as
mentioned earlier, we tried to examine other enzymes that
would  efficiently  remove  the  estrogenic  activity  of  an
endocrine-disrupting  chemical.  In  the  first  step,  we  deter-
mined  whether  or  not  POx  is  involved  in  the  degradation
of  endocrine-disrupting  chemicals.  Since  we  used  a  white
rot  basidiomycete,  P.  tremellosa,  for  the  degradation  of
endocrine-disrupting chemicals, isolation of a cDNA frag-
ment  of  pyranose  oxidase  from  this  fungus  was  per-
formed.

POx cDNA (D73369) was found in a white rot fungus,
T.  versicolor,  and  the  DNA  sequence  was  used  for  con-
struction  of  PCR  primers  as  follows:  forward  primer  5'-
ATGTCTACTAGCTCGAGCGA-3'  and  reverse  primer  5'-
GGGTGGTAACAGCCATACGC-3'.  Total  RNAs  were
isolated  from  the  P.  tremellosa  liquid  culture,  and  the
cDNAs  were  synthesized  by  following  a  previous  report
[3]. PCR with the primers resulted in isolation of a cDNA
fragment  consisting  of  1,872 bp,  including  the  open  read-
ing  frame  and  terminator.  The  nucleotide  sequence  showed
97%  identity  with  that  of  POx  of  T.  versicolor,  and  the
deduced  amino  acid  sequence  showed  99%  identity  with
the same enzyme of T. versicolor (Fig. 1). This was reported
to  the  EMBL  nucleotide  sequence  database with the acces-
sion number FR671428.

The degradation of phthalates by P. tremellosa has been
reported  [3],  and  genetic  transformants  containing  extra-

expected  length  (542 bp)  of  the  PCR  product  was  ampli-
fied  in  both  the  control  and  DEP-degrading  cultures,  and
POx  gene  expression  was  enhanced  about  30%  by  the
addition  of  DEP  (Fig.  2).  It  has  been  reported  that  POx
from white rot fungi can supply H2O2 during the degrada-
tion  of  lignin  and  recalcitrant  compounds  [9, 10],  and  the
enhanced  expression  of  POx  gene  under  the  degradation
conditions  of  DEP  shows  that  POx  is  possibly  involved
during  the  degradation  of  various  recalcitrant  compounds
in P. tremellosa.

copies  of  the  laccase  gene  show  increased  degrading  activ-
ity against phthalates [6]. In order to determine whether or
not  isolated  POx  is  involved  in  the  degradation  of  phtha-
lates,  analysis  of  diethylphthalate  (DEP)  degradation  was
performed  as  follows.  P.  tremellosa  was  grown  in  liquid
minimal  medium  (100 mL  in  250 mL  flask)  at  30oC  for  5
days  with  shaking,  and  the  culture  was  homogenized  five
times  for  1 sec  each  using  a  Waring  blender  [3].  The
homogenized  cells  were  transferred  to  200 mL  of  the  same
medium  containing  DEP  (200 mg/L)  (inoculums  size;  10%
v/v)  and  incubated  for  3  days.  Quantitative  determination
of DEP from culture supernatant and culture medium with
EDC  was  carried  out  using  a  Waters  HPLC  (HP  1,525
series,  Gemini  5 µm  C6-phenyl  110A  150 × 4.6 mm  col-
umn;  Waters,  Milford,  MA,  USA)  as  reported  previously
[5].  The  residual  concentration  of  DEP  was  decreased  to
65~70%  level  in  the  culture  supernatant  when  compared
to  that  of  control  (Table  1).  The  gene  expression  of  POx
was  determined  by  reverse  transcriptase-PCR  using  the
total  RNAs  from  the  3-day  grown  cultures  and  the  POx-
specific  primers  (forward  primer  5'-GCACCCGGACTG-
GTGGAACG-3'; reverse primer 5'-CGCAGCCACCGAG-
GAACAGG-3'),  with  actin  used  as  the  control.  The
