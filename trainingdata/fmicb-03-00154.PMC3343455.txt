Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a common chronic mycosis in Latin America, is a gran-
ulomatous systemic disease caused by the thermo-dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides
brasiliensis. The glycoprotein gp43 is the main antigen target of P. brasiliensis and a 15-
mer internal peptide (QTLIAIHTLAIRYAN), known as P10, deﬁnes a major CD4+-speciﬁc
T cell epitope. Previous results have indicated that, besides having a preventive role
in conventional immunizations prior to challenge with the fungus, protective anti-fungal
effects can be induced in P. brasiliensis-infected mice treated with P10 administered with
complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA). The peptide elicits an IFN-γ-dependent Th1 immune
response and is the main candidate for effective immunotherapy of patients with PCM,
as an adjunctive approach to conventional chemotherapy. In the present study we tested
the therapeutic effects of P10 combined with different adjuvants [aluminum hydroxide,
CFA, ﬂagellin, and the cationic lipid dioctadecyl-dimethylammonium bromide (DODAB)] in
BALB/c mice previously infected with the P. brasiliensis Pb18 strain. Signiﬁcant reduc-
tions in the number of colony forming units of the fungus were detected in lungs of
mice immunized with P10 associated with the different adjuvants 52 days after infec-
tion. Mice treated with DODAB and P10, followed by mice treated with P10 and ﬂagellin,
showed the most prominent effects as demonstrated by the lowest numbers of viable
yeast cells as well as reductions in granuloma formation and ﬁbrosis. Concomitantly,
secretion of IFN-γ and TNF-α, in contrast to interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, was enhanced
in the lungs of mice immunized with P10 in combination with the tested adjuvants,
with the best results observed in mice treated with P10 and DODAB. In conclusion,
the present results demonstrate that the co-administration of the synthetic P10 pep-
tide with several adjuvants, particularly DODAB, have signiﬁcant therapeutic effects in
experimental PCM.

INTRODUCTION
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis that typ-
ically starts as a granulomatous pulmonary disease subsequent
to the inhalation of conidia of the dimorphic fungus Paracoccid-
ioides brasiliensis. When it is not diagnosed and treated properly,
P. brasiliensis yeast cells can spread rapidly to lymph nodes, tegu-
ment, spleen, liver, and lymphoid organs of the digestive tract
(Shikanai-Yasuda et al., 2006). PCM is endemic in Latin America,
mostly affecting rural workers in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela
(Wanke and Londero, 1994), and the majorities are involved in
agricultural activities (Blotta et al., 1999; Restrepo et al., 2008). In
Brazil, approximately 1,853 (∼51.2%) of 3,583 conﬁrmed deaths
due to systemic mycoses from 1996 to 2006 were caused by PCM
(Prado et al., 2009).

gp43 is a glycoprotein of 416 amino acids (Puccia et al., 1986;
Cisalpino et al., 1996). A speciﬁc T-CD4
cell epitope was mapped
to a 15-amino acid sequence designated P10, which is recognized
by T cells from mice infected with P. brasiliensis. Immunization of
previously intratracheally infected BALB/c mice with P10 reduces
the fungal load in the lungs more than 200-fold as compared
to non-immunized animals (Taborda et al., 1998). P10 immu-
nized animals produced greater amounts of IFN-γ and interleukin
(IL)-12. These mice also had signiﬁcantly reduced damage to
lung tissue. In fact, the immune response elicited by P10 pre-
vents the rapid spread of P. brasiliensis, and we have hypothesized
that P10 administered as with newer adjuvants might enhance
the immunoprotection by the peptide. Hence, we have begun to
investigate the efﬁcacy of different adjuvants co-administered with

The role of adjuvants in therapeutic protection

P10. Along this line, we have found FliC ﬂagellin, derived from
Salmonella enterica, can signiﬁcantly modify the Th-1 immune
response associated with P10 (Braga et al., 2009).

Aluminum hydroxide (Alum) is another adjuvant widely
used in human and veterinary vaccines, which is highly effec-
tive in eliciting primary immune responses to target antigens.
Concerning secondary responses, the adjuvant stimulates a Th-
2 immune response that mainly stimulates the production of
antibodies.
In this sense it is perhaps less suitable for vac-
cines against intracellular microorganisms (HogenEsch, 2002).
Alum has been associated with severe local reactions such as
erythema, subcutaneous nodules, and contact hypersensitivity
(Baylor et al., 2002).

Promising results have been observed with complete Freund’s
adjuvant (CFA) and P10 (Marques et al., 2008). However, this
adjuvant causes a variety of side effects such as localized injection-
site granulomas, hepatic and renal granuloma formation, and
necrotizing dermatitis. Therefore, the use of CFA has been lim-
ited to experimental immunizations in animal studies. Due to
the severity of adverse reactions, this adjuvant has been banned
for use in humans as well as for non-experimental veterinary
administration (Stills Jr., 2005).

The idea of using cationic lipids (dioctadecyl-dimethylammo-
nium bromide, DODAB) as adjuvants arose from the effective
uptake of microparticles by both dendritic cells and macrophages
(Lincopan et al., 2009). Cationic polymer particles carry antigen
to these phagocytes and can efﬁciently stimulate antibody pro-
duction and activate cytotoxic T cells at low antigen dose (Singh
et al., 2000; Lincopan et al., 2009). DODAB also induces matu-
ration of dendritic cells (Thiele et al., 2001; Little et al., 2004)
with high levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ production, which may be
an important beneﬁt in the design of an anti-Paracoccidioides
vaccine.

In the present work, a comparative appraisal of the various
adjuvants is presented aiming to identify which compound pro-
duces the most effective immune response to P10 using murine
models of PCM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
ANIMALS
Six male BALB/c mice per group (6- to 8-week old) were housed
in polypropylene cages under speciﬁc pathogen free conditions.
Animals used in this study were bred at University of São Paulo
animal facility. All experiments involving animals were con-
ducted and approved by the Ethics Committee of University
of São Paulo and conducted in accordance with international
recommendations.

◦

FUNGAL STRAIN
Virulent P. brasiliensis Pb18 yeast cells were used to infect the
animals. The strain was maintained by weekly passage on solid
Sabouraud medium at 37
C and yeast cells were used after 7–
10 days of growth. Before the experimental infection, the fungus
was grown in modiﬁed McVeigh–Morton medium at 37
C for 5–
7 days (Restrepo and Arango, 1980). Fungal cells were washed in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) and counted in a hemo-
cytometer. The viability of fungal suspensions was determined by

◦

staining with trypan blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and was
always higher than 90%. The virulence of the Pb18 strain was
checked in each experiment by infecting BALB/c mice i.t. and
recovering the yeast cells from the infected organs.

INTRATRACHEAL INFECTION OF BALB/c MICE
BALB/c mice were inoculated i.t. with 3 × 105 virulent Pb18 yeast
cells/animal, grown on Sabouraud agar and suspended in sterile
saline (0.85% NaCl). A maximum volume of 50 μl was inoculated
per mouse. Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized i.p. with 200 μl of a
solution containing 80 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg of xylazine
(both from União Química Farmacêutica, Brazil). After approx-
imately 5 min, their necks were hyperextended, and the tracheas
were exposed at the level of the thyroid and injected with 3 × 105
yeast cells.

PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS AND PURIFICATION
Peptide synthesis and puriﬁcation was carried out at the Depart-
ment of Biophysics, UNIFESP as described previously (Taborda
et al., 1998). HPLC analysis showed that the synthetic P10 in the
amidated form was >90% pure.

IMMUNIZATION OF MICE
Immunization of BALB/c mice (6- to 8-week old males) was ini-
tiated 30 days after infection and repeated on days 37 and 44, by
the subcutaneous route, with 20 μg of P10 in presence of the
respective adjuvant. The adjuvants used were CFA with subse-
quent immunizations with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA);
Alum 100 μg/ml; FliC ﬂagellin 5 μg/animal, and cationic lipid
at 0.1 mM/animal. All adjuvants were vortexed with the peptide
before immunization. The animals were sacriﬁced 7 days after the
last immunization, at day 52 of infection.

COLONY FORMING UNITS
For each mouse, the lungs, spleen, and liver were excised and
weighed immediately after sacriﬁce. Tissues were individually
homogenized in PBS and 100 μl of this suspension was plated on
brain heart infusion medium (BHI; Difco Laboratories, Detroit,
MI, USA), supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum (Gibco,
NY, USA) and 5% of the spent culture medium of P. brasilien-
sis 192 isolate (Castañeda et al., 1988), streptomycin/penicillin
10 IU/ml (Cultilab, Brazil), and cycloheximide 500 μg/ml (Sigma,
◦
St Louis, MO, USA). The plates were incubated at 37
C for a
period of 10 days. The numbers of colonies were counted and
results expressed in colony forming unit (CFU) per gram of
tissue.

CYTOKINE ANALYSIS
Lungs of each mouse were macerated with protease inhibitor
(Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and centrifuged; supernatants of
these samples were used for cytokine detection. IL-4, IL-10, TNF-
α, and IFN-γ were measured using ELISA kits (BD Biosciences,
San Diego, CA, USA). The detection limits of the assays were as
follows: 7.8 pg/ml for IL-4, 31.25 pg/ml for IL-10 and IFN-γ, and
15.6 pg/ml for TNF-α, as previously determined by the manufac-
turer. Cytokine levels present in the supernatant preparations were
analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.

The role of adjuvants in therapeutic protection

HISTOPATHOLOGY
The lungs were excised, ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin (Merck,
Germany) and submitted to histopathological analysis [(hema-
toxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome].

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistics was done using GraphPad Prism 5 software (San Diego,
CA, USA). The results were expressed as mean values and stan-
dard deviations (SDs) of the indicated values. The non-parametric
Tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference test was employed. p-Values
of ≤0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.

RESULTS
COLONY FORMING UNITS IN INFECTED BALB/c MICE IMMUNIZED
WITH PEPTIDE 10 (P10)
After 30 days of infection, immunizations were initiated with three
weekly doses of P10 with or without the different adjuvants. After
52 days of infection, the fungal load was evaluated by enumeration
of CFUs from recovered organs (lung, spleen, and liver). Lungs
of mice immunized with P10 along with each of the different
adjuvants had a signiﬁcantly reduced number of CFU compared
to controls (Figure 1). The order of efﬁcacy for CFU reduction
was cationic lipid and P10 >> CFA/IFA > Alum > FliC. In this
model, we did not recover any fungal cells from the spleens or livers
of mice that received any of the immunizations with P10 (data
not shown), demonstrating the effectiveness of the peptide in the
control of experimental PCM. In contrast, the fungal burdens were
625 ± 60 CFU/g of tissue in the spleens and 296 ± 59 CFU/g of
tissue in the livers of unimmunized mice.

CYTOKINE PATTERN INDUCED BY IMMUNIZATION WITH P10
ASSOCIATED WITH ADJUVANTS
In comparison with control infected animals, IFN-γ was signiﬁ-
cantly increased in mice that received P10 with either cationic lipid
or FliC (Figure 2A). TNF-α levels were signiﬁcantly increased only
in mice treated with P10 and cationic lipid (Figure 2B). P10 immu-
nization with either cationic lipid or FliC signiﬁcantly reduced

immunized at 30, 37, and 44 days after infection with the different
adjuvants with or without P10. Animals were sacriﬁced after 60 days of
infection. Control animals were infected by not immunized (IFN). The
adjuvants used were: aluminum hydroxide alone (ALU) or with P10 (AP10),
FliC ﬂagellin alone (FLA) or with P10 (FP10), complete Freund’s adjuvant
alone (CFA) or with P10 (CF10), and cationic lipid alone (CLI) or with P10
(CP10). Signiﬁcant difference *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

levels of IL-4 (Figure 2C) and IL-10 (Figure 2D). Immuniza-
tion with P10 and Alum also reduced IL-10 levels, but did not
signiﬁcantly alter the levels of the other cytokines analyzed.

LUNG HISTOPATHOLOGY IN BALB/c MICE INFECTED (i.t.) WITH Pb18
AND IMMUNIZED WITH P10
Lung tissues from mice immunized with cationic lipid with or
without P10 were stained with H&E and compared with unim-
munized infected tissues as well as uninfected lungs (Figure 3).
As expected, the non-infected group (Figure 3A) showed nor-
mal lung tissue, and the unimmunized infected lungs (Figure 3B)
showed dense cell inﬁltrates with high numbers of fungal cells dis-
seminated throughout the lung parenchyma. In the case of mice
immunized only with the cationic lipid, we observed the forma-
tion of loose granulomas with many fungal cells (Figure 3C).
In contrast, lungs of mice immunized with cationic lipid and
P10 showed signiﬁcantly preserved lung parenchyma without
fungal cells (Figure 3D). The histological appearances of lungs
from mice immunized with either FliC (Figure 3E) or Alum
(Figure 3G) alone were similar to that with cationic lipid alone
(Figure 3C). Immunization of mice with P10 and FliC resulted in
improved granuloma formation in the lungs, which prevents the
spread of the fungus, and increased preservation of normal lung
parenchyma (Figure 3F). Although there was a slight increase in
normal lung parenchyma in mice immunized with P10 and Alum,
there was poor granuloma formation and large numbers of yeast
cells within areas of inﬂammation (Figure 3H).

The amount of pulmonary collagen type I in mice immunized
with P10 and FliC, Alum, or cationic lipid were compared with
unimmunized infected controls using Masson’s trichrome stain-
ing. Tissues from control mice revealed abundant collagen I ﬁbers
within cellular inﬁltrates containing large numbers of fungal cells
(Figure 4A). Although no fungal cells were visualized, lungs of
mice immunized with FliC ﬂagellin and P10 nevertheless diffusely
displayed increased amounts of collagen (Figure 4B). Mice immu-
nized with Alum and P10 showed large granulomas containing
fungal cells and the formation of collagen ﬁbers on the granu-
loma’s periphery (Figure 4C). In contrast, mice immunized with
cationic lipid and P10 displayed preserved lung tissue without
increased collagen (Figure 4D).

DISCUSSION
The P10 peptide (QTLIAIHTLAIRYAN) has important immuno-
protective properties that make it a leading candidate for the
development of a therapeutic vaccine (Taborda et al., 1998). We
have also shown that P10 immunization can be utilized concomi-
tantly with standard antifungal drugs in the treatment of PCM
and that co-administration may also prevent disease recurrence
(Marques et al., 2008).

The protective effect of P10 is related to the induction of an
INF-γ dependent Th-1 immune response (Taborda et al., 1998;
Travassos et al., 2007), so it may be stimulated by adjuvants or
nanoparticle encapsulation that increase the efﬁciency of P10
uptake by dendritic cells resulting in the enhanced presentation
of the peptide for cellular immune responses (Amaral et al., 2010;
Magalhães et al., 2012). In the present work, we show that the asso-
ciation of P10 with cationic lipids led to a signiﬁcant reduction of

The role of adjuvants in therapeutic protection

BALB/c mice 52 days after infection. Analyzed cytokines were: (A) IFN-γ,
(B) TNF-α, (C) IL-4, and (D) IL-10. Each group was infected i.t. with 3 × 105
yeast cells and immunized at 30, 37, and 44 days after infection with different
adjutants with or without P10. The groups of mice included unimmunized,

infected control mice (INF); animals infected and immunized with aluminum
hydroxide alone (ALU) or with P10 (AP10), FliC ﬂagellin alone (FLA) or with
P10 (FP10), and cationic lipid alone (CLI) or with P10 (CP10). *p < 0.05:

CFU in the lungs of 52-day infected animals (Figure 1). In con-
trast, animals immunized only with P10 (without adjuvants), had
minimal reductions in fungal burden (not shown data). Hence,
combining adjuvants, such as cationic lipids, with P10 can gener-
ate augmented immune responses mediated by Th-1 cells, directly
related to the secretion of IFN-γ (Figure 2A), which leads to peri-
toneal and lung macrophage activation as well as enhancing their
fungicidal effect on yeasts and conidia of P. brasiliensis (Buissa-
Filho et al., 2008). Immunization performed with P10 associated
with antifungal drugs in animals infected with Pb18, has been
shown to induce a signiﬁcant reduction in IL-4 (Marques et al.,
2008), which we now show also occurs in the setting of immu-
nizations with cationic lipid and P10 (Figure 2C). Moreover, P10
administration with cationic lipid also signiﬁcantly reduces levels
of IL-10 (Figure 2D). It is worth noting, however, that depending
on the degree of inﬂammation generated by the Th-1 response,
Th-2 cytokines are essential for balancing the immune response
and reducing the risk of self-damage (Travassos et al., 2008).

Studies with cationic lipids associated with recombinant HSP
of Mycobacterium leprae have demonstrated the ability of the
adjuvant to promote antigen presentation in lymph node cells
with production of high levels of IL-12 and INF-γ, suggesting
that cationic lipid can be useful in the formulation of vaccines
against intracellular bacteria, as well as against protozoa (Linco-
pan et al., 2009). IFN-γ is required for the synthesis of TNF-α by
macrophages and is essential for the accumulation of these cells
and their subsequent differentiation into epithelioid cells. INF-γ
is also responsible for granuloma’s formation and maintenance,
and, therefore, it plays a vital role in the control of dissemination
by fungi such as P. brasiliensis (Souto et al., 2000).

Although the cationic lipid/P10 association has demonstrated
the best protective response in the setting of short-term infection
in our murine model, it is relevant also to consider the protective
effect of the association of P10 and FliC ﬂagellin. A signiﬁcant
reduction in the number of CFU was observed and the cytokine
proﬁle was similar to that achieved with cationic lipid and P10

performed subcutaneously, according to Braga et al. (2009), better
results are obtained with intranasal immunizations.

In the lung parenchyma, P. brasiliensis induces chronic dam-
age leading to the development of pulmonary ﬁbrosis, which is
presumably due to persistent antigenic stimulation and an ongo-
ing active immune response. Granulomatous inﬂammation can
increase the formation of connective tissue rich in collagen type
I and III, leading to functional changes and subsequent ﬁbrosis
in the lung (Naranjo et al., 2010). Since ﬁbrosis is a well-known
sequela of PCM, it is therefore important that the adjuvants used
do not induce an exacerbated inﬂammatory response. In fact,
the association of cationic lipid and P10 resulted in a signiﬁ-
cant reduction of pulmonary ﬁbrosis in mice infected with Pb18
(Figure 4D).

In summary, we have shown that the examined regimens com-
bining P10 with different adjuvants results in signiﬁcantly different
protective responses. Administration of P10 with cationic lipid
provided the most effective response proﬁle, with the greatest
reduction in fungal burden and a Th-1 biased cytokine response
that maintained pulmonary architecture without inducing ﬁbrotic
injury.

levels obtained with FliC Flagellin and P10, can be associated
