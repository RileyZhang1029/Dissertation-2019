Chlorogenic acid (CGA) possesses various biological activities such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic activities. In 
the present study, we examined the effect of CGA on the transduction efficiency of PEP-1-ribosomal protein S3 (PEP-1-rpS3) into 
cells and brain tissues, and its neuroprotective potential against ischemia/reperfusion. We found that, in the presence of CGA, the 
trans duction efficiency of PEP-1-rpS3 into astrocytes and the CA1 region of the hippocampus was enhanced, compared to its trans-
duction in the absence of CGA. Also, cell viability data demonstrated that the sample treated with CGA + PEP-1-rpS3 exhibited im pro ved 
cell viability against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced toxicity more significantly than the sample treated with PEP-1-rpS3 alone. 
Also, in a gerbil ischemia model, data demonstrated that following the ischemic insult, the group treated with PEP-1-rpS3 + CGA 
showed markedly enhanced protection of neuron cells in CA1 region of hippocampus, compared to those treated with CGA or 
PEP-1-rpS3 alone. Taken together, these results suggest that CGA may improve the transduction efficiency of protein trans duction 
domain (PTD) fusion proteins into target cells or tissues, thereby enhancing their therapeutic potential against various diseases.

INTRODUCTION

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the interruption and 
res to ration of the blood flow to the forebrain lead to the neuronal 
dea th in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, or transient ische mia 
[1, 2]. During ischemia, a series of events, such as the de ple tion of

ATP, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an im balance of 
intracellular calcium concentration, and changes in cellular pH, cause 
cellular damage, apoptosis and/or necrosis [3, 4]. Pre vious studies 
have suggested that anti-oxidant enzymes such as superoxide dis-
mu tase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione pe roxidase can 
function as a defense mechanism against ROS-me di ated cellular 
damage, thereby proposing that these anti-oxi dant enzymes may 
be useful as a therapeutic agent against ROS-related diseases [5, 6]. 
Ribosomal proteins are essential components of ribosomes and 
highly conserved during evolution. Recently, it was reported that 
many ribosomal proteins could carry out extra-ribosomal func-
tions in apoptosis, mRNA processing, DNA repair, and develop-

ment [7, 8]. Ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) knockdown demon-
st rated that rpS3 is involved in nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB)-
medi ated gene regulations [9, 10]. Also, rpS3 has potential roles 
in pro cesses such as DNA repair and an apoptosis [11]. PEP-1-
rpS3 was reported to protect the CA1 region of the hippocampus 
against cerebral ischemic damage [12].
Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a phenolic compound derived from 
herbs, is well-known for having various biological properties. For 
example, it was shown that CGA, as a natural anti-oxidant, effec-
ti vely prevents iron-induced radical formation and exerts strong 
antimicrobial activity [13, 14]. Also, several studies revealed that 
CGA is an effective anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic 
agent in in vitro experiments and in vivo animal models [15-17]. 
Recen tly, numerous bio-molecules such as peptides and pro te-
ins, having therapeutic abilities, have been developed as new drug 
can didates. However, their large molecular sizes and poor hy d ro-
philicities reduce and/or restrict their bioavailabilities or deli ve ry 
to cells or tissues. Therefore, protein transduction do mains (PTD), 
including trans-activator of transcription (Tat) (RKKRRQRRR) 
from human immunodeficiency virus-1 and PEP-1 (KETWWET 
WWTEWSQPKKKRKV) derived from the nuclear lo calization 
sequence of simian virus 40, were developed to en hance the 
delivery of poor bioavailable drugs to cells or ti ssues [18-20]. In 
previous studies we reported that PTD fused proteins, such as 
PEP-1-rpS3, PEP-1-Frataxin and Tat-sensitive to apoptosis gene 
(Tat-SAG), can rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and 
provide neuronal protection against cerebral ischemic insults in 
ischemic animal models [21-23]. In addition, we demonstrated 
that several molecules, such as bog blueberry an thocyanins (BBA) 
and pergolide mesylate, have the potential to enhance the trans-
duction efficiency of PTD-fused proteins into cells and animal 
ti ssues, thereby leading to improved therapeutic activity [24, 25]. 
There fore, in this study, we examined whether CGA can enhance 
the transduction efficiency of PEP-1-rpS3 into astrocytes and 
brain tissues, and, consequently, can increase the po tential of PEP-
1-rpS3 to protect neuronal cells against ischemic insult.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Materials and cell culture
CGA and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium 
bromide (MTT) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, 
MO, USA). Primary antibodies against histidine and β-actin, and 
pe roxidase conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). All other che-
mi cals and reagents, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from 
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The astrocytes were grown 

in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% 
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 20 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 
7.4), 5 mM NaHCO3 and antibiotics (100 μg/ml streptomycin and 
100 U/ml penicillin) and kept at 37oC under a humidified atmos-
phere of 95% air and 5% CO2. 

Transductions of PEP-1 fusion proteins into astrocytes
PEP-1-rpS3 and PEP-1-green fluorescence protein (PEP-1-GFP) 
were purified as described previously [21]. To assess the con cen-
tration or time dependent transduction of PEP-1-rpS3 and PEP-
1-GFP, cells were grown to confluence in wells of a 6-well plate, 
pretreated with or without CGA (100 ng/ml) for 1 h, and then ex-
po sed to various concentrations (0.5~2 μM) of each protein for an 
addi tional 1 h or exposed to each protein (2 μM) for various times 
(10~60 min). The cells were then harvested and cell extracts were 
pre pared for Western blot analysis.

Western blot analysis
Equal quantities of β-actin normalized proteins from cell lysate 
were resolved by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose 
mem brane, which was then blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk 
in PBS. To detect both PEP-1-rpS3 and PEP-1-GFP, which con-
tain histidine sequence and PEP-1 domain, the membrane was 
pro bed with a rabbit anti-histidine polyclonal antibody (di lu ted 
at 1 : 10,000), followed by incubation with horseradish pe roxi-
dase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (diluted at 
1 : 10,000). The membrane was visualized by enhanced che mi-
luminescence according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amer-
sham, Piscataway, NJ, USA). 

Viability assay
An established assay based on MTT was used to assess cell via-
bility [23]. Astrocytes were grown to 70% confluence in wells of a 
96-well plate and pretreated with CGA (100 ng/ml) for 1 h. The 
cells were incubated with various concentrations of PEP-1-rpS3 
(0.5~2 μM) for an additional 1 h and cell toxicity was induced by 
treat ment with H2O2 (1 mM) for 4 h. Cellular viability was ex pre-
ssed as a percentage of a H2O2 untreated control.

Animals
Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) were purchased from 
the Hallym University Experimental Animal Center. They were 
per mi  tted free access to food and water, ad libitum. All ex peri men-
tal procedures involving animals and their care con formed to the

In vivo transduction of PEP-1-rpS3 into brain tissues
To examine the effect of CGA on the transduction of PEP-1-rpS3 
into brain tissues, CGA (100 μg/kg) was i.p. administered, followed 
by an i.p. injection of PEP-1-rpS3 (150 μg/kg) 1 h later. Brain 
biopsy samples were immunostained using a rabbit anti-histidine 
(1 : 400) and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1 : 
200). The sections were visualized with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine 
(DAB) in 0.1 M Tris buffer and observed under a microscope 
(Olympus DP72 digital camera, Tokyo, Japan).

Induction of cerebral forebrain ischemia in experimental 
model
To determine whether CGA affects the protective effect of PEP-
1-rpS3 against ischemic damage, male Mongolian gerbils were 
randomly divided into 5 groups (n=7); sham-operated, vehicle 
treated, CGA-treated, PEP-1-rpS3-treated, and PEP-1-rpS3 + 
CGA treated groups. CGA dissolved in PBS was i.p. injected (100 
μg/kg). Then, PEP-1-rpS3 (150 μg/kg) was administered i.p. 30 
min prior to the occlusion of common carotid arteries. For the 
occlusion of common carotid arteries, gerbils were placed under 
general anesthesia with a mixture of 2.5% isoflurane (Abbott 
Laboratories, North Chicago, IL, USA) in 33% oxygen and 67% 
nitrous oxide. A midline ventral incision was made in the neck, 
and the common carotid arteries were isolated, freed of nerve 
fibers, and occluded with nontraumatic aneurysm clips. Complete 
interruption of blood flow was confirmed by observing the 
central artery in the eyeball using an ophthalmoscope. After 5 
min occlusion, the aneurysm clips were removed. The restoration 
of blood flow (reperfusion) was observed directly under the 
ophthalmoscope. Sham-operated animals (n=7) were subjected 
to the same surgical procedures except that the common carotid 
arteries were not occluded. Rectal temperature was monitored and 
maintained at 37± 0.5°C before, during, and after the surgery, until 
the animals had recovered fully from anesthesia. Immediately 
following ischemia-reperfusion, animals from each group were 
euthanized for cresyl violet staining.

Tissue processing for histology 
All animals from each group were anesthetized with sodium pen to-
bar bital and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformal dehyde in 0.1 
M PBS (pH 7.4). Brain tissues were post-fixed in the same fixative for 4 
h, followed by infiltration with 30% sucrose over night. The tissues 
were then frozen and sectioned with a cryo stat at 50 μm. Cresyl violet 
staining was performed as des cribed pre viously [22,23]. 

Effect of CGA on Protein Transduction

Statistical analysis 
Data are expressed as the means±SD. Comparison between groups 
was performed by Student’s t test. Values of p<0.01 and p<0.05 
were considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS 

CGA enhanced the transduction of PEP-1 fused proteins 
into astrocytes
We previously reported that PEP-1-rpS3 can be effectively trans-
duced into cells and animal tissues, thereby providing protection 
against UV damage or ischemic insult [12, 21]. To assess the effect 
of CGA on the transduction efficiency of PEP-1-fused proteins, 
we compared the extent of transduction of PEP-1-rpS3 and PEP-1-
GFP into astrocytes in the presence or absence of CGA using Western 
blot analysis. The chemical structure of CGA and schematic 
sequences of PEP-1-rpS3 and PEP-1-GFP were shown in Fig. 1. As 
shown in Fig. 2, both PEP-1-rpS3 and PEP-1-GFP were delivered 
in a dose- and time- dependent manner to the cells without treat-
ment of CGA. Particularly, when pretreated with CGA, a clear 
in crease in the transduced amount of PEP-1-rpS3 and PEP-1-GFP 
was observed, compared to the samples without CGA pre treat-
ment. These results demonstrated that CGA has the ability to im-
prove the in vitro transduction of PEP-1 fused proteins.

CGA produced no cellular toxicity 
We next examined whether the enhanced transduction of PEP-1-
fu sion proteins is ascribed to altered membrane permea bili ty induced 
by CGA. As illustrated in Fig. 3, H2O2 (1 mM) produced apparent 
cell death to 44% of control cells. Although CGA is known to have 
anti-oxidant properties, CGA alone at the concentration (100 ng/
ml) which was employed in our experiments failed to recover the 
cell viability against H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Cell viability 
did, however, increase with increasing concentrations of PEP-1-

Fig. 3. CGA increases the protective effect of PEP-1-rpS3 against 
hydrogen peroxide-induced cellular death. Cells were pretreated with 
CGA (100 ng/ml) for 1 h and then treated with PEP-1-rpS3 for additional 
1 h. After induction of cellular toxicity by H2O2 (1 mM) for 4 h, cell via-
bili ty was assessed using a MTT assay and is expressed as a percentage of a 
H2O2 untreated control. Statistical significance (*p<0.05, **p<0.01), com-

gerbils. CGA (100 μg/kg) was administered i.p. to gerbils and then PEP-1-
rpS3 (150 μg/kg) was i.p. injected 1 h later. Brain tissue was removed and 
immunhistological anlaysis was performed using a rabbit anti-histidine 
polyclonal antibody and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody.

100 μg/kg 1 h prior to injection of PEP-1-rpS3 (150 μg/kg) and the 
distribution of PEP-1-rpS3 in the brain was identified by immu-
no histological staining. Fig. 4 shows results consistent with in 
vitro transduction of PEP-1-rpS3. rpS3 is not found in the brain 
tissues at all. The significant transduction of PEP-1-rpS3 was fo-
und in the CA1 regions of the hippocampus. In addition, much 
st ron ger signals in the same region were identified after combi na-
tio nal treatment with PEP-1-rpS3 + CGA than the sample treated 
with PEP-1-rpS3 alone, suggesting the effectiveness of CGA in the 
transduction of this fusion proteins.

Transient ischemia induces the neuronal loss in the CA1 region 
of the hippocampus. We evaluated protection in each group aga-

to logical analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, most of cells in CA1 region

rpS3 (0.5~2 μM). Moreover, co-treatment with PEP-1-rpS3 and 
CGA demonstrated further increases in cell viability, relative to 
the samples treated with PEP-1-rpS3 alone. At the maximal con-
centration of PEP-1-rpS3, CGA pretreatment enhanced cell via-
bility, by approximately 11%. These data suggest that CGA can 
enhance the anti-oxidant activity of PEP-1-rpS3 without dis play-
ing any additional toxicity or anti-oxidative effects to astro cytes.

sli ghtly increased the number of viable cells in the CA1 region and 
also treatment with PEP-1-rpS3 clearly exhibited en han ced pro-
tec tion against cell death in the CA1 region. Above all, the extent 
of neuronal protection in the sample treated with CGA + PEP-1-
rpS3 was similar to that in the sham control, demon  st ra ting that 
com binational treatment with CGA + PEP-1-rpS3 was much 
more protective against neuronal cell death induced by transient 
ischemia than that of CGA or PEP-1-rpS3 alone.

DISCUSSION 

CGA is a polyphenol, which is abundantly found in coffee, fruits 
and vegetables. Several studies have provided evidence showing 
that CGA has various biological activities such as anti-oxidant, 
anti-inflammatory and analgesic. CGA has the ability to suppress 
12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced tumor 
promotion in a mouse model [26] and to induce p38 mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent apoptosis in chronic 
myelogenous leukemic cells [27]. Also, the mechanism for anti-
tumor activity of CGA suggests that, following treatment with 
UVB and TPA, CGA up-regulates cellular phase II anti-oxidant 

enzymes and suppresses activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-
κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and MAPK signaling pathways 
mediated by ROS [28]. CGA inhibits synthesis and release of 
inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and NO, and provides 
anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities in animal models of 
carrageenin-induced inflammation and formalin-induced pain 
[16]. Therefore, up-regulating levels of anti-oxidant enzymes in 
target cells or tissues can be proportional to the enhancement 
of therapeutic potentials of these enzymes. Increasing the 
intracellular levels of therapeutic proteins is also proposed as an 
effective therapy against several ROS-related diseases. Previously, 
we reported that, through fusion of rpS3 with PEP-1, one PTD, 
PEP-1-rpS3 can be effectively transduced into cells or brain 
tissues, suppress ROS generation and ischemic damage induced by 
oxidative stress, and functions as a neuroprotective agent [12].
In this study, we investigated a novel function of CGA to enhan ce 
the delivery of PEP-1 fusion proteins to cells and tissues, thereby 
in creasing their cellular bioavailability and therapeutic potential. 
Our cell viability data demonstrated that, although CGA is well-
known as an anti-oxidant molecule, CGA alone, at 100 ng/ml 
con cen t ration, had no influence on H2O2-induced toxicity in

reperfusion and stained with cresyl violet. The damaged area of brain tissue was CA1 of hippocampus. (B) Relative density of viable cells in CA1 region.

astro cytes (Fig. 3) and exhibited similar cell viability to the sample 
trea ted with H2O2. However, the existence of CGA improves the 
neuroprotective effect of PEP-1-rpS3 against H2O2, compared to 
the samples treated with PEP-1-rpS3 alone. Therefore, as we did 
not observe any clear neuroprotective effect of CGA alone, in this 
experiment we excluded the possibility that CGA provided any 
direct neuronal protection against H2O2 in the sample co-treated 
with CGA+PEP-1-rpS3. Next, to investigate the reason for the 
enhanced neuroprotective activity in the sample co-treated with 
CGA and PEP-1-rpS3, we examined whether treatment with 
CGA could affect transduction of PEP-1-rpS3 into astrocytes and 
sub sequently enhance its neuroprotective effect against ischemic 
insult. As shown in Fig. 2, the transduction data show that treat-
ment with CGA can considerably improve the transduction of 
PEP-1-rpS3 into astrocytes. Moreover, in vivo transduction data 
con firmed that PEP-1-rpS3, which has the ability to spontaneously 
cross the BBB, exhibited enhanced transduction into brain ti ssues 
in the presence of CGA (Fig. 4), as evidenced by in vitro trans-
duc tion results. As a result of the enhanced transduction of PEP-
1-rpS3 by CGA, an animal transient ischemia model provides the 
evi dence that, even if CGA alone showed slight neuroprotection 
in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, CGA has the ability to de-
fi nitely improve the transduction of PEP-1-rpS3 into brain tissues, 
re sulting in improved neuroprotective effects of PEP-1-rpS3 
against ischemic insult (Fig. 5).
Various biological activities of polyphenol such as CGA have 
been drawing much attention from many research groups. Because 
of the characteristic physicochemical properties of polyphenol, 
they chelate metals, scavenge ROS and exert a broad spectrum of 
bio logical activities [16,29]. On the other hand, our present study 
demon strates that CGA also has the novel function of enhancing 
the transduction of PEP-1-fusion proteins beyond its already well-
known anti-oxidant function. One reason for the different results 
may be that the function of CGA as an anti-oxidant in other lite-
ra ture was evaluated at the higher concentrations than that we 
used in this study. Moreover, others have suggested that there is a 
corre lation between biological activity and the concentration of 
bio molecules. For instance, although (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate 
(EGCG), one of polyphenols, exhibited effective in vitro anti-can-
cer activity in the concentration of 10~100 μM, it is possible that 
its concentration in plasma or tissues was observed as very low by 
oral administration because of very poor bioavailabilty [29, 30]. 
Thus, it is considered that the concentration of CGA, cell lines, 
ex peri mental conditions and assay methods may contribute to ab-
solu tely different results. 
Many research groups have tried to explain how PTD could 
tra verse the cellular membrane and the BBB. Although the me-

cha nisms of PTD transduction are suggested such as a direct 
pe ne t ration via electrostatic interaction with negatively charged 
phos pholipids, endocytosis-mediated pathways, and a formation 
of inverted micelles or pores structure, these mechanisms are still 
controversial [31-34]. Besides CGA, several molecules such as 
DMSO, BBA, and pergolide mesylate were reported to have the 
potential to enhance the transduction of PTD fusion pro te ins 
[24, 25, 30]. Even if, until now, it is still not clear which mo le-
cular events mediated by CGA or other molecules are res pon si-
ble for enhancing the transduction of PTD fusion proteins, it is 
presumable that CGA might be related with one of the mecha nism 
suggested above or increase permeability of the cellular mem-
branes, subsequently facilitating transduction of PTD into cells 
and BBB. Therefore, additional studies are required to investigate 
molecules and pathways to take part in the process of transduction 
of PTD fusion proteins. Also, it is undoubtedly necessary to de ve-
lop agents which could enhance transduction efficiency for thera-
peutic molecules having poor transduction efficiency.
Taken our results together, we demonstrate that CGA has the 
novel activity to significantly enhance transduction efficiency of 
PEP-1-fused therapeutic proteins into target cells or tissues, and, 
con sequently, lead to improvement of their therapeutic potential.
