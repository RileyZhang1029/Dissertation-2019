The pathogenesis of LN involves multiple factors, including genetic predisposition, epigenetic regulation and environmental interaction.
Over the last decade, omics-based techniques have been extensively utilized for biomarker screening and a wide variety of variations which are associated with SLE and LN have been identiﬁed at the levels of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics.
These studies and discoveries have expanded our understanding of the molecular basis of the disease and are important for identiﬁcation of potential therapeutic targets for disease prediction and early treat- ment.
In this review, we summarize some of the recent studies targeted at the identiﬁcation of LN-associated biomarkers using genomics and proteomic approaches.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by production of autoantibodies against a broad range of self-antigens including DNA, RNA, histones and other nuclear components.
In most patients, vital organs and tissues are often implicated, including kidney, brain, car- diovascular, joint and skin.
Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common and serious complication in SLE and is associated with signif- icant mortality and morbidity of SLE patients.
Generally, 74% of lupus patients will develop clinically relevant nephritis at  * Corresponding author.

The pathogenesis of LN is a complex process, involving deposition of autoanti- bodies in the glomerulus, activation of complement and mac- rophages, extracellular matrix proteins, pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines, which are then linked through multiple mechanisms to cause tubular damage, tubulointerstitial inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis.
So far, LN remains a major challenge and continues to be one of the most severe manifestations of SLE [2].
The medical therapy for LN depends on the severity of the disease.
Thus, ﬁnding reliable biomarkers for LN will help to evaluate disease activity, identify patients at risk for kidney damage and facil- itate early diagnosis and intervention to improve favorable outcomes [3].
Multiple lines of evidence have supported a genetic etiology in SLE and LN.
Linkage analysis and Genome-wide associa- tion studies (GWAS) have been used for screening lupus sus- ceptibility and analyses of common genetic variants in lupus have revealed a number of susceptibility loci [4,5].

Other heritable factors of complex human disease may broadly reside in epigenetic mechanisms.
Epigenetics refers to heritable modiﬁcations that regulate gene expression without causing DNA sequence changes.
Common epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modiﬁcation and regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs).
The variations at the genetic and epigenetic level may be reﬂected by the different level of protein biomarkers such as autoanti- bodies and cytokines in serum and urine of LN patients.
In this paper, we will brieﬂy review recent discoveries of genetic and proteomic biomarkers, which are associated with susceptibility and pathogenesis of LN.
Genes and genetic variations associated with LN  SLE susceptibility is a complex trait.
Some linkage studies have assessed many candidate genes for potential roles in pre- disposing to SLE.
A comparative study of relative risk of dis- ease in siblings of patients with that of the larger population indicated that SLE has a strong genetic basis [8].
In addition, genetic analyses of inbred murine models of systemic autoim- munity also strongly support a genetic predisposition for SLE susceptibility [9].
Further studies have shown that the ge- netic basis of LN predisposition exhibits in two aspects.
On one hand, some susceptibility alleles of candidate genes are associated with LN disease severity.
On the other hand, there exists a set of kidney-speciﬁc genes that are likely to amplify or sensitize patients to autoimmune pathology of LN [10].
Advances in high-throughput genotyping technology and completion of the Human Genome Project facilitate the devel- opment of genome-wide searches for genetic polymorphisms to SLE and LN.
The availability of the entire genome sequence has drastically changed the study of genetic predisposition of LN during the past several years.
Chromosomal regions con- taining possible susceptibility loci can be identiﬁed by linkage analysis based on the genetic location.
Until now, many candi- date genes of LN predisposition have been identiﬁed.
Histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been demonstrated to be linked to lupus traits, nephritis and production of auto- antibodies [11].
Freedman et al.
reported human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B8 and DR2 are positively associated with LN in patients of both African Americans (blacks) and whites [12].
HLA-DQA and HLA-DR alleles have also been shown to be associated with LN in an Italian population in another study [4].
Furthermore, several studies have shown that low- afﬁnity variants of both Fcc receptor (FccR) IIA and IIIA are associated with SLE and LN, and FccRIIA genes are important disease susceptibility factors for SLE, particularly for LN, suggesting that the Fc receptor may inﬂuence clinical manifestation of LN [13,14].
In addition, copy number varia- tion of the rat and human Fcgr3 genes is a determinant of sus- ceptibility to immunologically mediated glomerulonephritis, which provides direct evidence for the importance of genome plasticity in the evolution of genetically complex phenotypes [15].
A meta-analysis on the V158F variant of FccRIIIA re- vealed an increased risk of LN for individuals with two copies of the risk allele (F/F) [16].
The FcgRIIIA-V/F158 polymor- phism may be a susceptibility factor for SLE and LN, play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease and show prognostic and therapeutic implications as well [16,17].
The  predominant distribution of FccRIIA homozygous R/R131 genotype observed in LN patients indicated that this genotype is a heritable risk factor for immune complex mediated renal injury in Brazilian lupus patients [18].
Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis has uncovered differ- ential gene expression proﬁle in murine LN.
By microarray analysis of glomerular gene expression, Teramoto et al.
identi- ﬁed 567 up-regulated genes in the glomeruli of MRL/lpr mice with LN compared to control congenic mice.
Those included complement components, adhesion molecules, chemokines and their receptors, and molecules related to antigen presenta- tion [19].
Allam et al.
observed a greater expression and activa- tion of mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2) gene in the spleen and kidneys in a mouse model of lupus (MRL-Faslpr mice) than healthy controls.
Their data suggested that the induction of Mdm2 promotes the expansion of plasma cells, which cause autoantibody production and immune complex disease in MRL-Faslpr mice [20].
Therefore, antagonizing Mdm2 may have therapeutic potential in LN.
Liu et al.
iden- tiﬁed kallikrein (KLK) genes that are associated with the sus- ceptibility to anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody-induced nephritis and LN [21].
The polymorphisms in the promoter region of KLK genes are responsible for the differential expression of KLK-kinin in the kidney of different mice strains, and the higher expression of KLK plays a protec- tive role against LN [22,23].
Another study on lupus mouse model reported that STAT4-deﬁcient NZM mice developed accelerated nephritis and displayed increased mortality in the absence of high levels of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA Abs) and in the presence of relatively reduced levels of IFN-c.
In contrast, STAT6-deﬁcient NZM mice exhibited a signiﬁcant reduction in incidence of kidney disease with a dramatic increase in survival, in the presence of high levels of anti-dsDNA Abs.
These studies indicate that STAT4 may be associated with LN [7].
In recent years, more candidate genes have been identiﬁed.
For example, the programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1 or PD1) PD1.3A allele was reported to be a risk factor for LN in Euro- pean descendants [6].
PDCD1 gene variation was also associ- ated with LN and these ﬁndings conﬁrmed PDCD1 as a LN susceptibility marker [24].
In addition, Jonsen et al.
reported that variation in the promoter of the pentraxin C-reactive pro- tein (CRP) gene has been associated with SLE or SLE nephri- tis in Caucasian and African ethnicities [25].
Among the LN susceptible genes, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensinogen (AGT) are the best illustrated renal-speciﬁc factors.
Two polymorphisms, Alu insertion/deletion (I/D) and 23 949 (CT)2/3, in the ACE gene that were correlated with serum ACE levels have now been associated with LN in several studies [26,27], while the M235T polymorphism in the AGT gene was also shown to be associated with LN in Asians [26].
Furthermore, meta-analysis showed the ACE D allele or DD genotype could be a predictive marker for risk of SLE or LN.
D allele and DD homozygous are signiﬁcant ge- netic markers to predict SLE susceptibility, while DD geno- type is a valuable marker to predict the LN risk [28].
Functional genetic polymorphisms of some cytokines and chemokines have been identiﬁed to be correlated with LN.
For example,  2518 A/G polymorphism of inﬂammatory mediator monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been shown to be associated with LN [29].

Association studies evaluate candidate genes based on their function in the immune system or their aberrant expression in lupus patients [10].
Some important candidate genes associated with LN are summarized in Table 1.
Aberrations in epigenetic regulation for LN  Immune-mediated LN is multigenic and/or multifactorial in origin.
Epigenetic mechanisms get involved in a variety of autoimmune disorders, including LN, by regulating immuno- genicity and autoantibody production.
The inﬂuence of epige- netic mechanisms on LN has been investigated in many studies.
Epigenetic modiﬁcations can inﬂuence gene expression and alter cellular function without modifying the genomic se- quence.
Three main epigenetic processes include DNA methyl- ation, nucleosome repositioning by histone modiﬁcations and miRNAs [41].
DNA methylation  Until now, DNA methylation is the most widely studied epige- netic modiﬁcation.
Usually, methylation of cytosine in the reg- ulatory sequences of DNA is associated with transcriptional inactivation of genes, whereas hypomethylation is related to the activation of transcription.
Many studies have indicated correlation of DNA methylation with the pathogenesis of SLE.
Hypomethylated state of genes in T and B lymphocytes has been generally observed in SLE patients [41,42].
For in- stance, the lymphocytes from SLE patients displayed gene hypomethylation when compared to normal controls.
Studies using demethylating agents indicate that DNA hypomethyla- tion plays a pathophysiological role in SLE and LN.
The hypomethylated state and demethylated DNA fragments in the serum of SLE patients can induce the production of anti- DNA antibodies, which are involved in the pathophysiology of SLE and LN [41,43].
D32 C707T DQA\0101 DQB\0201 PD1.3G/A PpXx Gly54Asp A38G Allele 114  The degree of hypomethylation was thought to be correlated with lupus disease activity.
Numerous methylation-sensitive genes are over-expressed in lupus CD4+ T cells.
Also, CD8+ T lymphocyte and NK cell speciﬁc perforin (PRF1) was over- expressed due to hypomethylation modiﬁcation of DNA in SLE patients [44] and overexpression of serine/threonine protein phosphatase gene PP2A was reported in SLE patients [45].
Wen et al.
reported hypomethylation was crucial for apoptotic DNA to induce SLE-like autoimmune disease in SLE-non-susceptible mice by producing high levels of anti-dsDNA Abs, proteinuria and glomerulonephritis [46].
Reduced CD5 expression caused by hypomethylation of an intracellularly expressed truncated CD5 variant (CD5-E1B) on the surface of B lymphocytes pro- motes auto-reactivity in SLE [47].
The involvement of DNA methylation in X chromosome provides a potential explanation for the female predominance in SLE [47].
In CD4+ T cells of fe- male SLE patients, demethylation with 5-azacytidine results in overexpression of the CD40 ligand, which is a B lymphocyte co-stimulatory molecule encoded on the X chromosome.
How- ever, hypomethylation is not associated with SLE for male SLE patients due to the fact that the male X chromosome is demethy- lated under physiological conditions [48].
Histone modiﬁcations  tails  that are accessible  The histone octamer consists of two copies of each of the his- tone proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.
Histone complexes pos- sess ﬂexible N terminal to posttranslational modiﬁcations and can strongly impact the functional capacities of nucleosomes [41].
Histone modiﬁca- tion patterns in SLE are complicated.
Firstly, systemic inﬂam- mation and subsequently causes apoptosis or death of lymphocytes, which drives the release of nuclear particles.
Nucleosomes released from apoptotic cells cannot be cleared sufﬁciently, which leads to the accumulation of excessive amount of chromatin debris (DNA, histones and nucleosomes) in the circulation and tis- sues [49].
Autoreactive B cells can further be activated by tak- ing up the released nuclear particles and differentiate into  response,  activates  systemic  immune  a   Li Y et al / Biomarkers for Lupus Nephritis  161  autoantibody-producing plasma cells, which drives polyclonal immune complex formation and causes glomerulonephritis in the kidney [49].
During LN inﬂammatory reaction process, his- tone modiﬁcation often occurs.
Histone acetylation in some re- gions is associated with disease activity.
For example, acetylated histone H4, H2A and H2B become autoantibody targets in lupus [50].
On the other hand, histone acetylation in other regions seems to have protective effects [51].
Adminis- tration of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors led to re- duced IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-c in splenocytes and improved glomerulonephritis in MRL-lpr/lpr mice [51].
His- tone hyperacetylation has also been shown to be associated with the progression of SLE.
Histone deacetylase sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) was over-expressed in MRL/lpr CD4+ T lymphocytes.
HDAC-treated cells contained autoantigens, which responded to SLE-derived autoantibodies [52].
Hyperacetylation of genes related to apoptosis or cell cycle regulation plays a role in SLE and LN [52].
In addition, genome-wide acetylation of histones seems to improve the symptoms in lupus-prone mice while hyperacetylation of various genetic loci in human SLE is asso- ciated with disease severity [53].
MicroRNAs  miRNAs are short non-coding RNA sequences that regulate gene expression by blocking protein translation or inducing mRNA degradation.
The variation in miRNAs could cause the dysregulation of a broad range of targeting genes, which are associated with diseases.
Therefore, miRNAs could be good biomarkers for autoimmune diseases [54].
The circulating miR- NAs are systematically altered in SLE even LN [54].
The varied expression of miRNAs in kidney during pathological processes makes miRNAs a valuable new tool for understanding, diagnos- ing, and discovering therapeutic options for SLE and LN.
Dai et al.
compared miRNA expression in renal biopsies of LN patients with normal controls by microarray technology and identiﬁed 30 down-regulated and 36 up-regulated miR- NAs.
These differentially expressed miRNAs may be potential diagnosis biomarkers to illuminate pathogenic mechanisms in LN [55].
Increased expression was detected for miR-142-3p and miR-181a in SLE patients, while expression of miR- 106a, miR-17, miR-20a, miR-92a and miR-203 was decreased.
Moreover, expression of miR-343-3p, miR-223 and miR-20a was signiﬁcantly low in SLE patients with LN [54].
Compared to healthy controls, expression of miR-638, miR-198 and miR- 146a was signiﬁcantly different in LN patients [56].
Further- more, the degree of change in glomerular miR-146a and tubulointerstitial miR-638 expression was correlated with clin- ical disease severity, suggesting that these miRNA targets may play a role in the pathogenesis of LN [56].
miR-371, miR-423, miR-1224, miR-663 and miR-638 were reported to be differen- tially expressed in LN across different racial groups.
Among them, miR-371, miR-1224 and miR-423 were the ﬁrst to be re- ported to be associated with LN [57].
Additionally, expression of miR-221 and miR-222 in urinary sediment was associated with LN disease activity and may also serve as biomarkers [58].
Proﬁling protein biomarkers in LN  The differential expression of protein biomarkers in serum and urine of SLE patients may reﬂect the pathophysiological status  of disease development and therefore may be used as biomark- ers for early diagnosis and prognosis.
Common protein mark- ers include antigens, autoantibodies and cytokines, etc.
Serum protein markers for LN  Autoimmune serology markers of SLE include anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-C1q antibodies and complement C3 and C4 levels.
Anti-dsDNA antibodies, ﬁrst detected and measured 55 years ago, are the best studied of all autoantibodies found in SLE and are still ubiquitously used to help diagnose and manage this disease, because the level of this autoantibody is correlated with disease activity [59].
In addition, nucleosomes play a pivotal role in the development of kidney lesions by mediating the production and binding of autoantibodies to ba- sal membranes [60].
Meta-analysis showed that anti-nucleo- some antibodies are a highly accurate diagnostic marker for SLE and LN [61].
In addition, serum anti-C1q antibody is also a valuable noninvasive biological marker for prediction of renal histopathology in LN.
The level of serum anti-C1q antibody can be used as a marker for LN activity with higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity than traditional markers of dis- ease activity, such as C3/C4 consumption and anti-dsDNA [62].
Large-scale screening of the disease biomarkers using high throughput autoantigen microarray has facilitated the discov- ery of disease biomarkers at the global level.
By using a glo- merular proteome array, Li et al.
identiﬁed autoantibody clusters that best predict the disease activities of SLE and LN [63].
Some of the autoantibody clusters, such as anti-chro- matin, anti-DNA, anti-Ro and anti-RNP, were associated well with disease activity in SLE and incomplete lupus (ILE) [64].
They found that presence of IgM autoantibodies in patient s sera was associated with reduced LN severity [63,64].
These studies veriﬁed proteomic microarray as a powerful tool for uncovering novel autoantibody biomarkers for autoimmune diseases.
In recent years, some novel serum biomarkers for LN have been identiﬁed.
For instance, serum a proliferation-inducing li- gand (APRIL) as well as its intrarenal mRNA levels were re- ported to be associated with resistance to treatment, indicating that APRIL could be a potential biomarker for pre- dicting difﬁcult-to-treat cases of LN [65].
Panda et al.
reported that higher and intermediate mannose binding lectin (MBL) levels are signiﬁcantly associated with nephritis in SLE patients [66].
Since serum cystatin C is a good marker for renal func- tion, the serum b2 microglobulin/cystatin C (Sb2 M/SCysC) index could be a better indicator of renal activity in SLE [67].
In addition, serum complement factor H (CFH) levels are also associated with disease activity of LN [68].
Serum lev- els of soluble interleukin 7 receptor (sIL-7R) are strongly aug- mented in patients with LN, thus it may be a marker of SLE disease, especially nephritis [69].
A cross-sectional study including 20 patients suggested that vanin-1 level in peripheral blood may be a promissory biomarker for LN and warrants further validation in a larger cohort [70].
Other cytokines and chemokines have been proved to be associated with LN, including VEGF [71] and higher levels of IL-18 and IFNc [72].
Increased levels of macrophage inﬂammatory protein-1a (CCL3), MCP-1, RANTES and IFNc-induced protein-10 are also observed in the serum of SLE patients [73].
162  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 158 165  Urine Biomarkers for LN  immunochemical  identiﬁcation of proteins,  Generally, urinary substances are likely to reﬂect kidney dam- age better than serum components.
Urine is a source of bio- ﬂuid which is easy to harvest and the biomarkers in urine are usually reﬂecting the renal function directly in various kinds of nephritic diseases.
Proteomic approaches, such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometric and/ or surface- enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spec- trometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) and capillary electrophoresis-MS, have been used to screen potential urine biomarkers that are associated with renal damages caused by LN [74].
The usual markers of renal disease include urinary protein, creatinine, etc., although the currently recommended spot urinary protein to creatinine ratio may not be sufﬁciently sensitive to detect early nephritis.
Urinary biomarker candidates include adhe- sion molecules, cytokines, chemokines and their receptors [74].
The urinary proteome proﬁles of 129/Sv and DBA/1 mice that developed severe immune-mediated nephritis are signiﬁ- cantly different from those of B6 and BALB/c mice [75].
For example, levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1), P-selectin, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and CXCL16 were higher in the 129/Sv and DBA/1 strains, which were highly susceptible to severe immune-mediated glomerulo- nephritis.
Another pilot transferrin, a1-acid-glycoprotein (AGP) and lipocalin-type prostaglandin D-synthetase (L-PDGS) may serve as potential biomarkers for impending nephritis ﬂares in pediatric lupus [76].
study showed that  More new urinary biomarkers have been reported.
For example, urinary VCAM-1 level is associated with nephritis activity in SLE patients [77].
In addition, baseline mean uri- nary MCP-1 levels were signiﬁcantly correlated with both LN class and severity of LN ﬂare, hence, the high speciﬁcity makes urinary MCP-1 become a non-invasive marker for determining lupus ﬂare and LN class [78].
Moreover, urinary free light chains (FLCs) are potentially useful biomarkers in International Society of Nephrology and Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) class III/IV LN or proliferative LN [79].
Furthermore, urinary tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) levels were correlated with all active indexes of LN, suggesting its potential role as a novel bio- marker of active LN [80].
Based on these studies, we summa- rized the protein markers in Table 2.
Conclusion  Over the last decade, omics-based techniques have been exten- sively utilized for biomarker screening at the level of genetics, epigenetics and proteomics.
Reviewing the current list of best validated LN disease susceptibility candidate genes and the po- tential functional interaction of these genes may allow us to elucidate the genetic basis of LN predisposition.
The effect of epigenetic regulation on LN pathology may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of LN.
The variations at the genetic and epigenetic level as well as the environmental factors may work together to drive the pathogenesis of LN.

As more emerging novel technologies, such as next-genera- tion sequencing and high throughput proteomic arrays, are being widely employed in biomarker screening, we are expect- ing more and more biomarkers associated with lupus nephritis will be discovered.
Elucidating the underlining molecular mechanisms between the biomarker dysregulation and disease phenotype will lead us to identify potential therapeutic targets for treatment of LN, and also to establish better tools for pre- diction, early diagnosis and prognosis of lupus nephritis.
