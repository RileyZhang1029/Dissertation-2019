the
replication forks is one of the main
tasks of
the DNA damage response.
Specifically, checkpoint mechanisms detect
stressed forks and prevent their collapse.
In the published report reviewed here
we have shown that defective chromatin
assembly in cells lacking either H3K56
acetylation or the chromatin assembly
factors CAF1 and Rtt106 affects
the
integrity of advancing replication forks,
despite the presence of functional check-
points. This loss of replication inter-
mediates is exacerbated in the absence of
Rad52, suggesting that collapsed forks
are rescued by homologous recombina-
tion and providing an explanation for the
accumulation of recombinogenic DNA
damage displayed by these mutants.
These phenotypes mimic those obtained
by a partial reduction in the pool of
available histones and are
consistent
with a model in which defective histone
deposition uncouples DNA synthesis
and nucleosome assembly, thus making
the fork more susceptible to collapse.
Here, we review these findings and
discuss the possibility that defects in the
lagging strand represent a major source
of fork instability in chromatin assembly
mutants.

Introduction

The DNA damage response functions as a
barrier that prevents genetic instability, a
hallmark of cancer development.1 The
integrity of the replication fork is a central
component of this response,2 and muta-
tions that affect the mechanisms involved
in the detection, stabilization and repair of

far, however, the analyses of these mecha-

A first approach to this problem came
some years ago with the finding that cells,
from yeast to humans, accumulate genetic
instability when they are defective in chro-
matin assembly, as determined by increased
frequencies of recombination and gross
chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) in
these cells.8-15 However,
that
chromatin assembly is also associated with
DNA replication–independent processes
known to influence genome integrity,
such as DNA repair and transcription,
leaves open the question of how genetic
instability is linked to problems in histone
deposition. In fact, a general phenotype of
cells with mutations in chromatin assembly
factors is that they are highly sensitive to
DNA damaging agents.10,11,13,16-21

To validate this hypothesis, we took
advantage of
findings
about the mechanism of histone deposi-
tion mediated by the acetylation of newly
synthesized histone H3 at lysine 56. This
modification (H3K56ac) is catalyzed by
the histone acetyltransferase Rtt109 upon
presentation of the H3/H4 heterodimer
by the histone chaperone Asf1.11,13,19 In a
seminal work, Zhang, Verreault
and
colleagues
showed that H3K56ac pro-
motes nucleosome assembly at the fork

fork integrity was not due to the lack of
H3K56 acetylation per se but rather to
defective nucleosome assembly.

Previous ChIP analyses have shown that
cells defective in H3K56 acetylation lose
their replisome integrity in the presence
of hydroxyurea (HU).28,29 Since this drug
causes fork stalling by depleting dNTPs,
this result suggested a role for H3K56
acetylation in keeping the stability of
stalled forks. We confirmed this loss of
fork integrity by 2D gel analysis and
extended it to cells lacking CAF1 and
Rtt106. Remarkably, the loss of replica-
tion intermediates was higher in the pre-
sence than in the absence of HU except
for nucleosome assembly mutants lacking
the recombinational repair protein Rad52,

a partial reduction in the pool of available

similar phenotypes of

possibility to explore is that a defect in
the supply of histones uncouples DNA
synthesis and histone deposition,
thus
exposing unassembled and unstable DNA
fragments behind the fork that might
directly break or form nuclease-processed
DNA structures. Although fork breakage
and its repair by recombination can occur
at both the leading and lagging strands,
the later appears to be more susceptible
to problems during DNA replication.37

advance is rapidly followed by nucleosome assembly of the newly synthesized DNA through
a process that requires physical interactions between components of the replisome and chromatin
assembly factors. A defect in the supply of histones causes some of the forks to collapse and break,
likely by uncoupling of the processes of DNA synthesis and histone deposition. The temporal
association between Okazaki fragment maturation and nucleosome assembly supports the idea
that the lagging strand is more susceptible to breakage under conditions of defective chromatin
assembly. Homologous recombination can efficiently repair the broken fork by BIR, although
additional, non-recombinational microhomology-mediated BIR (MMBIR) mechanisms can also
operate on rDNA. In some cases, the broken fork is repaired by nonhomologous end joining,
leading to GCRs and genetic instability, an event that is triggered in the absence of homologous
recombination. See text for more details.
