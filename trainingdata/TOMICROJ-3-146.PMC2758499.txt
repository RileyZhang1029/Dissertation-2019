Abstract:  Residual  insertion  sequence  elements  (IS  elements)  in  Escherichia  coli  strains  that  are  commonly  used  for 
DNA  cloning  are  known  to  cause  cloning  artifacts  by  transposing  themselves  into  the  recombinant  DNA  fragments.  In 
such  cases,  chance  insertion  of  IS  elements  may  occur  at  integration  sites  in  the  cloning  targets,  which  in  the  case  of  
the  IS10 element  is a 9-bp consensus sequence. We  report here that  the integration of IS10-related DNA  sequences  into 
the pUC19 cloning vector  and its derivative occurred with considerable frequency in E.  coli  strains  JM107 and DH10B, 
with  duplication  of  a  9-bp  segment  (TCTAAAGTA).  Notably,  native  polyacrylamide  gel  electrophoresis  revealed  that  
intrinsically bent DNA flanks the insertion site.  

Keywords: Bent DNA, cloning vector, DNA curvature, IS10, mobile element. 

INTRODUCTION  

  Transposition  of  IS  elements  is  a  strong  motive  force 
underlying  genetic  mutations  in  Escherichia  coli  [1]  and 
affects  some  mobile  elements,  even  in  resting  cells  [2]. 
Kovarík  et  al.  [3]  reported  that  IS10-related  sequences  are 
major contaminants of the cloned DNA sequences appearing 
in  international  DNA  databases  (EMBL,  GenBank,  and 
DDBJ). For instance, they showed that a 1.3-kb IS10-related 
DNA  fragment  was  inserted  into  the  recombinant  plasmid 
during  recloning  of  the  repetitive  sequence  R8.3  from Nico-
tiana tabacum. It also has been reported that cloning eukary-
otic DNA enhances transposition of IS elements [4], and that 
transposition  of  IS2  element  into  the  cloning  vector  pUC18 
can occur spontaneously [5].  

  DNA  conformation  is  known  to  be  a  key  determinant 
modulating  genome  function  [6].  DNA  bending,  or  curva-
ture,  is  one  of  the  unusual  DNA  conformations  that  can  
affect transcription in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes [7, 8]. 
Bent  DNA  is  also  involved  in  regulating  DNA  recombina-
tion  [9-11].  In  the  present  paper,  we  report  spontaneous  
insertion of IS10 element into the plasmid vector pUC19 and 
its  derivative,  pAL79,  at  a  site  within  an  intrinsically  bent 
DNA region.  

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

  During  the  course  of  analyzing  the  topology  of  super-
coiled plasmid DNA of pUC19 and its derivatives, we came 
across  several  topoisomers  of  covalently  closed  circular 
DNA  (cccDNA),  the  sizes  of  which  were  unexpected  (data 
not  shown).  These  unexpected(cid:31)spots  of  DNA  topoisomer

appeared  on  2-dimensional  agarose(cid:31)gel  electrophoresis 
when  the  DNA  samples  were  prepared  from  old  cultures 
(e.g.,  cultures  left at room temperature for several days after 
the  stationary  phase).  To  identify  DNA  molecules  of  unex-
pected  size,  we  examined  E.  coli  strain  JM107  transformed 
using  conventional  procedures  with  plasmid  pAL79,  a 
pUC19  derivative  containing  the  AL79  minisatellite  [12]. 
The transformants were collected and inoculated into 2 ml of 
LB  medium  containing  50  (cid:1)g/ml  of  ampicillin,  after  which 
they  were  incubated  at  37°C  overnight  with  shaking.  The 
plasmid DNA was then isolated from 0.5 ml of culture using 
the  rapid  boiling  method  [13]  and  electrophoresed  on  aga-
rose  gel,  which  confirmed  that  the  cells  contained  authentic 
pAL79  plasmid  by  size  estimation.  The  overnight  cultures 
were  then  left  for  10  days  at  room  temperature,  after  which 
aliquots  were  spread  on  ampicillin  (50  (cid:1)g/ml)-containing  
LB  agar  plates.  After  incubating  overnight,  109  colonies 
were collected, irrespective of their size, and each was inocu-
lated  into  2  ml  of  LB  medium  containing  50  (cid:1)g/ml  of  
ampicillin.  The  plasmid  DNA  was  again  isolated  using  the 
boiling  method, and  the  electrophoretic patterns were exam-
ined.  We  found  that  five  of  the  plasmid  DNA  samples 
showed  an  additional  DNA  band  (an  example  is  shown  in 
Fig. 1A), which we hypothesized might be the result of spon-
taneous insertion of an IS element, as suggested by de Togni 
et  al.  [5].  But  because  the recA-genotype  is  known  to  affect 
the transposition efficiency of IS elements [14-16], in subse-
quent  experiments  we  examined  the  occurrence  of  altered 
plasmid  molecules  using  Escherichia  coli  strain  DH10B,  a 
recA-deficient  strain.  With(cid:31)the  same  subculture  procedure, 
one  of  296  colonies  of  DH10B  transformants  retained  the 
altered pAL79 plasmid (Fig. 1B, vertical arrow), while 2 out 
of 100 colonies of DH10B transformants retained the altered 
pUC19  plasmid  (Fig.  1C). While  the  majority  pAL79  DNA 
was  normal  in  the  fresh  overnight  cultures  of  JM107  trans-
formants  harboring  the  altered  pAL79  (Fig. 1A),  the  altered

plasmid  was  more  abundant  than  the  normal  plasmid  in 
DH10B transformants harboring pAL79 (Fig. 1B) or pUC19 
(Fig.  1C).  At  this  moment,  it  is  unclear  why  the  relative 
amount  of  altered  size  plasmid  varies  with  the  host  strain 
(JM107 or DH10B). High copy number of the plasmid DNA 
in  the  cells,  low  rate  of  IS  transposition  and  the  recA  geno-
type may be the factors that relate to this observation. 

  To  characterize  the  altered  plasmid  DNA,  the  fraction 
containing the altered(cid:31)pAL79 (marked with an arrowhead in 
the  lane  2  of  Fig.  1A)  was  recovered  from  the  agarose  gel 
and  used  to  transform  E.  coli  strain  DH10B.  The  recloned 
pAL79  cccDNA  was  then  isolated  from  the  transformants, 
and  digested  using  the  restriction  endonuclease  Dra  I.  This 
indicated  that  a  DNA  sequence  was  inserted  into  the  0.7-kb 
Dra  I  fragment  of  pUC19  vector,  resulting  in  the  presence 
of(cid:31)an additional DNA fragment and making the 0.7-kb Dra 
I  fragment  slightly  longer  (Fig.  2A).  We  then  carried  out 
PCR  amplification  with  several  sets  of  primers  to  identify 
the  inserted  fragment.  We  eventually  determined  that  the 
insertion had occurred near the upstream terminus of the 0.7-
kb  Dra  I  fragment,  after  which  we  amplified  the  267-bp  re-
gion  spanning  positions  1691  to  1957  of  pUC19  (GenBank 
accession  M77789)  using 
the  following  primers:  5’-
TGAACGAAATAGACAGATCGCTGAGAT-3’(forward) 
5’-GTTTGCAAGCAGCAGATTACGCGCAGA-3’ 
and 
(reverse).  When  the  recloned  cccDNA  (altered  pAL79)  was 
used  as  the  PCR  template,  a  1.6-kb  fragment  was  amplified 
(Fig.  2B,  lane  2).  But  when  plasmid  preparations  from 
DH10B (the lane marked with an arrow in Fig. 1B and lane 2 
of Fig. 1C served as the template, a 1.6-kb fragment in addi-

tion  to  the  authentic  267-bp  fragment  was  amplified  (data 
not shown).  

  The  nucleotide  sequences  of  the  1.6-kb  fragments  from 
both  the  altered  pAL79  and  pUC19  (from  DH10B  transfor-
mants)  plasmids  were  determined  after  their  purification 
from the excised gels. We found that the inserted sequences 
shared about 94% identity with most IS10 elements and that 
the  insertion  into  pAL79  and  pUC19  occurred  at  the  same 
site:  position  1771-TACTTTAGA-1779  in  the  vector  region 
of pUC19 with duplication of a 9-bp segment. Although the 
nucleotide  sequences  differed  to  a  small  degree  (94%  iden-
tity)  from  that  reported  by  Kovarík  et  al.  [3],  the  inserted 
part  of  the  IS10  element  (corresponding  to  the  region  span-
ning nucleotides(cid:31)58 to 1390 of AJ293237) was nearly iden-
tical except the boundary nucleotides. 

  The  observed  target  site  for  IS10  insertion  did  not  com-
pletely  match  the  consensus  sequence  for  IS10  integration 
sites (5'-NPuCNNNGPyN-3') reported by Kovarík et al. [3]. 
Instead,  the IS10 insertion into pUC19 DNA may be related 
to an intrinsic preference for the DNA conformation. For that 
reason,  we  compared  the  electrophoretic  mobility  of  DNA 
fragments containing the IS10 target site in their native con-
formations  in  5%  polyacrylamide  gels  at  4°C.  Three  differ-
ent 257-bp fragments were prepared by PCR with the appro-
priate  primers  and  subjected  to  electrophoresis.  The  results 
of the PCR are shown in Fig. (3) and the physical map of the 
target  regions  is  shown  in  Fig.  (4A  and  4B).  The  fragment 
containing the IS10 target site in its middle (Fig. (3), lane 1) 
migrated more slowly than the others, suggesting it assumes 
a  bent  conformation,  as  bending  in  the  middle  of  the  frag-
ment would cause a more pronounced retardation of mobility

applied  to  the  gel  in  duplicate.    The  respective  DNA  primer  pairs  used  for  the  PCR  were:  1661-CTACACGACGGGGAGTCAGGCAA

than bending elsewhere [6]. In similar fashion, integration of 
IS2  into  the  lac  operon  promoter  in  pUC18  [5]  also  might 
reflect  the  flexibility  of  the  target  DNA  region,  as  the  lac 
promoter  region  is  reportedly  looped  as  a  result  of  DNA 
bending  [17,  18].  To  support  DNA  bending  occurring  near 
the  integration  site  1771-TACTTTAGA-1779,  we  have 
computed the predicted curvature and bendability by Bend.it 
server [19]. The curvature prediction has found several local 
maximum  points,  and  one  of  the  curvature  peaks  appears 
coincidence with a local minimum of the bendability, where 
it  flanks  the  integration  site  (Fig.  4C,  around  the  nucleotide 
position 1791). This suggests that the rigid bent helical struc-
ture is formed at the local maximum peak of predicted curva-
ture  near  the  integration  site.  Other  curvature  peaks  exist  

in  relatively  higher  bendability  regions  meaning  that  the  
regions are curved but rather flexible.  

  Not only does transposition often occur spontaneously in 
resting  cells  [2],  it  can  be  induced  by  UV  irradiation  [20], 
and  the  IS10  element  is  a  major  contaminant  of  eukaryotic 
DNA  sequences  in  databases  [3].  It  is  known  that  insertion 
of  sequence  elements  is  intrinsically  regulated  by  transcrip-
tional,  translational  and  pos-translational  mechanisms,  as 
well  as  by  host  factors  [21].  However,  the  DNA  conforma-
tion at  the  target site  may  also  affect  the  efficiency of  trans-
position, since it modulates various other processes affecting 
DNA (transcription, replication and recombination) [6]. And 
also,  as  reported  by  Nash  and  colleagues  [22,  23],  bending

of  DNA  at  bacteriophage  (cid:2)  attachment  site  has  occurred  in 
the  integrative  recombination.  Consistent  with  that  idea,  the 
native  polyacrylamide  gel  electrophoresis  carried  out  in  the 
present  study  showed(cid:31)that  the  site  targeted  by  the  IS10  
element is surrounded by intrinsically bent DNA. Given that 
bent DNA segments tend to preferentially locate at the apices 
of  plasmid  superhelices  [24],  it  may  be  that  the  bent  DNA 
region  surrounding  the  IS10  target  site  is  situated  at  the  
apex  of  a  plectonemic  superhelix,  thereby  facilitating  IS10 

insertion.  

CONCLUSION 

 
In  summary,  we  report  here  on  the  susceptibility  of  a 
plasmid  vector  to  insertion  of  an  IS10  element.  Insertion  of 
IS10 element into a plasmid vector has been shown to occur 
spontaneously during storage of stationary cultures of E. coli 
strains  JM107  and  DH10B.  At  present,  it  remains  unclear 
whether  any  other  insertions  into  the  plasmid  occur  in  
E. coli.
