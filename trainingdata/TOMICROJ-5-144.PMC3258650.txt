Abstract:  RSV  infection  is  a  leading  cause  of  lower  respiratory  tract  infection,  especially  in  High-risk  infants  with  a 
history of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), congenital heart disease (CHD), neuromusculair impairment, 
immunodeficiency, and Down syndrome. Host related risk  factors  that have been identified to be associated with severe 
RSV related lower respiratory tract infection include young age below 6 months at the beginning of RSV season, multiple 
birth,  male  sex,  low  socioeconomic  status  and  parental  education,  crowded  living  conditions,  young  siblings,  maternal 
smoking and indoor smoke pollution, malnutrition/small for gestational age, family history of atopy or asthma, low cord 
serum RSV antibody titers, and living at altitude. 

Risk factors  increasing the risk of acquisition of RSV have been identified to be birth before and/or during RSV season, 
day care attendance, presence of older siblings in school or day-care, and lack of breast feeding. Some of these risk factors 
are discussed controversially and some of them are found continuously throughout the literature.  

Given  the  high  cost  of  RSV  prophylaxis,  especially  for  the  large  population  of  late  preterm  infants,  algorithms  and  risk 
score  systems  have  been  published  that  could  identify  high-risk  infants  for  treatment  with  palivizumab  out  of  this 
gestational  age  group.  Several  models  reported  on  an  average  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  70  percent  and,  thus,  are 
helpful to identify infants at high risk for severe RSV infection and need for prophylaxis with palivizumab.

INTRODUCTION 

  Respiratory  syncytial  virus  (RSV)  is  a  leading  cause  of 
viral  lower  respiratory  tract  infections  (LRTI)  in  early 
childhood, causing an estimated 33 Million LRTI in children 
under  the  age  of  five,  3.4  million  hospitalizations  and 
between  66,000-199,000  deaths  annually,  globally  [1]. 
Almost  all  infants  are  infected  by  2  to  3  years  or  following 
two  RSV  seasons  [2].  Infection  rates  peak  in  infants  aged  
up  to  3  months.  Several  hypotheses  exist  to  explain  the 
severity  of  RSV  -  LRTI  during  the  first  few  months  of  life. 
Immunologic  processes  play  an  important  role,  including  an 
immune  complex  reaction  Type  III  occurring  in  the  lung 
between  RSV  antigen  and  maternal  acquired  IgG  antibodies 
[3] accompanied by a lack of secretory IgA antibodies, a cell 
mediated  Type  IV  reaction  in  the  lung  [4]  and  T-cell 
independent  mechanisms 
implicating  macrophages  and  
MIP  1(cid:2)  and  other  chemokines.  Additionally  the  immature 
immune system and the small infant’s airways are important 
factors  explaining  the  severity  of  RSV  disease  within  the 
first  months  of  life  [5].  This  review  aims  to  summarize  the 
evidence for risk factors associated with severe RSV - LRTI.

PATIENT  GROUPS  AT  HIGH  RISK  FOR  SEVERE 
RSV DISEASE 

Prematurity 

immature 

Prematurity  goes  along  with  small, 

immature  and 
 
vulnerable  airways,  an 
immune  system,  an 
incomplete transfer of maternal antibodies and an inadequate 
cellular immunity which  is necessary for the viral  clearance. 
The  lung  development  at  30  weeks  gestational  age  (GA) 
reveals  lung  volumes  being  about  three  times  smaller  and  a 
surface area being about four times smaller compared to term 
infants,  whereas  air  space  walls  have  an  increased  wall 
thickness by one third of that of term infants [6]. 

  A  longitudinal  study  up  to  10  months  of  chronological 
age  by  Ballow,  et  al.  [7].  demonstrated  that  hypogamma- 
globinemia  correlated  with 
lower  gestational  age  and 
remained  up  to  6  months  of  chronological  age  in  preterm 
infants  below  1500  grams.  Following  discharge  from  the 
NICU significantly higher incidence of infections, especially 
LRTIs,  were  observed  in  preterm  infants.  Consecutively 
preterm  infants  were  more  often  rehospitalized  compared  
to  term  infants.  However,  despite  severe  hypogamma- 
globinemia  none  of  the  preterm  infants  had  bacterial 
infection. Another study by De Sierra, et al. [8] revealed that 
RSV-  specific  antibody  titers  were  lower  in  premature 
infants  of  (cid:1)  28  weeks  GA  compared  with  term  infants;

and  preterm  infants  of  (cid:2)  29  weeks  GA  had  RSV-  specific 
titers  against  F  and  G  protein  comparable  to  those  of  term 
infants.  

 
Prematurity  also  alters  the  course  of  RSV  infection. 
Prematurely  born  infants  presented  more  often  with  apnoea, 
had  a  higher  incidence  of  atelectasis/infiltrate  and  hyper- 
inflation  on  radiographic  examination,  longer  hospital  stays, 
a  higher  physiologic  stability  index  and  therapeutic  inter- 
vention  score  and  were  more  likely  to  receive  supplemental 
oxygen, 
ICU  admission,  mechanical  ventilation  and 
parenteral  fluid  therapy  [9].  These  findings  were  confirmed 
by  a  prospective  study  including  infants  younger  than  24 
months  and  being  hospitalized  for  RSV  infection  [10]  
that  revealed  remarkable  differences  regarding  length  of 
hospital  stay  and  severity  of  clinical  course  of  disease 
demonstrated  by  higher  LRI  scores,  more  days  of  oxygen 
requirement  and  respiratory  support  between  preterm  and 
term born infants.  

  Horn,  et  al.  [11]  found  significant  differences  regarding 
ICU  admission  and  rate  of  intubation  as  well  as  length  of 
hospital  stay  between  preterm  born  and  term  born  infants 
with  the  highest  resource  use  in  the  late  preterm  infants  of  
33 - 35 weeks GA. In this study the rehospitalization rate due 
to RSV virus infection was 3.6%. 

 
Stevens, et al. [12] found a RSV rehospitalization rate of 
7.6%  in  prematures  born  <32  weeks’  gestation  with  the 
highest rate of 13,9% in the subgroup (cid:1)26 weeks gestational 
age.  The  IMPACT  trial  [13]  confirmed  these  findings  and 

revealed  in  infants  < 35 weeks’ gestation  a rehospitalization 
rate of 8.1% in the placebo arm, in those born between 32-35 
weeks’  gestation  this  number  was  even  higher  (9.8%). 
Carbonell-Estrany,  et  al.  [14]  found  a  rehospitalization  rate 
of 9% in infants born (cid:1)32 weeks of gestation. However there 
were  several  studies  with  lower  rates  like  studies  by  Resch, 
et al. [15] that observed a RSV rehospitalization rate of 2.5% 
in premature infants of 29 to 36 weeks gestation´, Law, et al. 
[16] with a rate of 3.6% in infants of 33-35 weeks’ gestation 
and  Figueras-Aloy,  et  al.  [17]  with a  rate  of  3.7%  in  infants 
of 33-35 weeks’ gestation. 
  Recent  data  by  Gunville,  et  al.  [18]  showed  again  a 
higher  rate  of  6.6%  (18/271)  of  children  aged  under  2  years 
born  prematurely 
(<36  weeks’  gestation)  and  being 
rehospitalized  due  to  RSV  disease.  In  the  subgroup  analysis 
2.6% were below 32 weeks’ gestation and 4.1% were of 32- 
35 weeks’ gestation.  

  A summary of the data is shown in Table 1.  

Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) 

  Ventilated preterm infants, especially  those below 1000g 
birth  weight,  are  at  high  risk  for  developing  BPD.  In  these 
infants  ventilation-induced  volutrauma  and  oxygen  toxicity 
as  well  as  pre-  and  postnatal  infections  can  initiate  and 
sustain  a  pulmonary  inflammatory  response  leading  to  a 
possible  impaired  development  of  the  lung  [19]  Groothuis,  
et  al.  [20]  were  the  first  to  study  the  burden  of  early 
rehospitalization  in  a  prospective  study  including  30  infants

<  2  years  with  BPD  receiving  home  oxygen  therapy  after 
discharge  from  the  hospital.  In  this  group  11  of  15 
hospitalizations  were  due  to  an  RSV  infection,  36%  of  the 
infants were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 18% of 
whom  required  mechanical  ventilation.  In  the  PREVENT 
Study [21], a randomized placebo controlled  trial on  the use 
of intravenous immunoglobulin prophylaxis (RSV- IGIV) in 
preterm  infants  with  and  without  BPD,  17.4%  infants  with 
BPD (26/149) were rehospitalized due to proven RSV infection. 
The IMpact- study [22], a randomized, double- blind, placebo 
controlled  trial  conducted  in  the  United  States,  Canada  and 
the United Kingdom determining the safety and efficiency of 
palivizumab,  revealed  an  RSV-  rehospitalisation  rate  of 
12.8%  in  infants  with  BPD,  which  was  reduced  to  7.9% 
(39%  reduction)  in  the  group  having  received  palivizumab 
prophylaxis.  Thereafter  several  other  studies  revealed  RSV 
hospitalization  rates  ranging  up  to  24.4%  [11,  14,  23,  24]. 
Stevens, et al. [11] reported in a cohort of 131 infants requiring 
respiratory  support  beyond  36  weeks  postconceptional  age 
that  24.4%  were  rehospitalized  due  to  RSV  infection.  They 
were  also  more  likely  to  be  admitted  with  RSV  than  infants 
with  respiratory  support  up  to  36  weeks  postconceptional 
age. In the study of Carbonell- Estrany [14] RSV rehospitaliza-
tion rate was 15% in infants with chronic lung disease. In the 
multivariate  logistic  regression  model  the  higher  risk  for 
hospital admission in infants with chronic lung disease was a 
significant prognostic variable (p < 0,016).  

  Greenough,  et  al.  [24]  reported  in  retrospective  review 
that  in  a  study  cohort  of  235  neaontes  prematurely  born 
neonates < 32 weeks’ gestation requiring oxygen beyong 28 
days after birth 19% were readmitted to the hospital due to a 
proven RSV infection. 

  A more recent study from The Munich RSV Study Group 
[25] reported on a rehospitalisation rate of 15.4% in preterm 
infants  (cid:1)  35  GA  with  BPD.  In  the  multivariate  logistic 
regression  model  BPD  as  well  as  male  sex  and  day  care- 
attendance  of  siblings  yielded  statistical  significance  as  an 
independent predictor for RSV rehospitalisation.  

  Another  prospective  German  multicentre  study  from  the 
RSV Paed Study Group [26] found RSV hospitalization rates 
of 12.3% (50/ 356) in preterm infants with BPD. The authors 
also  reported  on  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of 

Sommer et al. 

nosocomially  acquired  RSV  infections  in  the  BPD  group 
(30.8  %  vs.  9.8  %,  p<0.001).  In  the  univariant  analysis  the 
criterion  premature  infant  having  BPD  requiring  treatment 
over  the  last  months  was  significantly  associated  with  a 
complicated  clinical  course  and  was  significantly  and 
independently  associated  with 
the  combined  outcome 
“complicated course of disease” in  the multivariate  analysis. 
A summary is shown in Table 2.

from  RSV 

Infants  with  CHD  are  known  to  be  at  increased  risk  of 
 
severe 
regarding  higher 
morbidity  (more  complicated  clinical  course,  e.g.  need  
for  assisted  ventilation  or  longer  duration  of  oxygen 
supplementation)  and  higher  mortality  rate  that  first  was 
reported  by  MacDonald,  et  al.  [27]  to  be  as  high  as  37%. 
Navas,  et  al.  [28]  from  the  PICNIC  Study  Group  in  Canada 
reported  on  260  (16.4%)  out  of  1584  patients  with  RSV 
infection  having  underlying  cardiac  disease.  These  children 
required  oxygen  supplement  for  a  significant  longer  time 
period  and  had  a  significantly  higher  mortalitiy  rate  (3.4%) 
compared to children without cardiac disease. In a following 
study  from  the  PICNIC  Study  Group  Wang,  et  al.  [29] 
reported  on  a  lower  rate  of  8.2%  (57/689)  of  children  with 
underlying cardiac disease showing a mortality rate of 5.3%.. 
In  the  Cardiac  Trial  (1998)  [30]  the  use  of  RSV  hyper- 
immune  globulin  in  the  prevention  of  severe  RSV  infection 
was  associated  with  increased  mortality,  thus,  the  newly 
developed  humanized  monoclonal  antibody,  palivizumab, 
had  to  be  proven  to  be  safe  in  this  particular  population. 
Feltes,  et  al.  (2003)  [31]  published  data  of  a  multicenter, 
randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  of  1287 
children  with  hemodynamically  significant  CHD  reporting 
on  an  RSV  hospitalization  rate  of  9.7%  (63/648)  that  was 
impressively  reduced  by  45%  using  monthly  palivizumab 
prophylaxis.  Based  on  this  data  an  AAP  policy  statement 
was  released  in  2003  [32]  recommending  RSV  prophylaxis 
with  palivizumab  for  children  <24  months  with  underlying 
hemodynamically  significant  CHD.  This  recommendation 
was  also  outlined  in  the  revised  AAP  guidelines  in  2009 
[33]. The Palivizumab Outcome  Registry Group (2008) [34] 
collected  data  on  1500  children  with  CDH  accounting  for 
7.7%  of  the  entire  registry  cohort  of  19548,  who  received

RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab over four seasons (2000-
2004).  The  majority  (71%)  had  acyanotic  CDH.  Overall, 
only  1,9%  exhibited  rehospitalization  due  to  laboratory- 
confirmed  RSV  infection.  The  hospitalization  rate  was 
significantly  higher  for  subjects  with  compared  to  those 
without  diagnosis  of  CDH  (1.9  %  vs.  1.2%,  p  <  0,03),  but 
was  significantly  lower  compared  to  former  trials.  A  recent 
California  state-wide  study  by  Chang,  et  al.  (2010)  [35]  
on  the  use  of  palivizumab  in  CDH  demonstrated  a  19% 
reduction rate of RSV related hospitalizations being equal to 
seven  fewer  RSV  hospitalizations  per  year  for  patients  with 
hemodynamically  significant  CHD.  In  a  Danish  study  [36] 
predictors  of  RSV  hospitalization  included  Down  syndrome 
(OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.80 to 5.80), cardiomyopathy (odds ratio 
(OR)  5.84,  95%  CI  1.26  to  27.16)  and  hemodynamically 
significant  heart  disease  (OR  1.53,  95%  CI  1.04  to  2.26)  by 
multivariate  analysis.  Predictors  for  the  need  of  respiratory 
support  during  RSV  hospitalization  including  supplemental 
oxygen,  nasal  continuous  positive  airway  pressure  or 
mechanical  ventilation  were  young  age  (relative  risk  (RR) 
0.47,  95%  CI  0.32  to  0.67  per  additional  year  of  age)  and 
cardiac decompensation (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.23). 

  Table 3 summarizes rehospitalization rates due to RSV in 
children with CHD.  

Neuromuscular Impairment  

infection  are 

  Another  group  of  infants  being  at  increased  risk  for 
severe  RSV 
those  with  neuromuscular 
impairment. Factors predisposing to a more severe course of 
RSV  disease  in  neuromuscular  disease  include  the  impaired 
ability to clear secretions from the airways due to ineffective 
cough  resulting  from  respiratory  muscle  weakness  and  
the  high  prevalence  of  gastro-oesophageal  reflux  and 
swallowing  dysfunction,  which  leads  to  aspiration  [37]. 
Several  studies  have  proven  the  increased  morbidity  and 
mortality 
in  patients  with  an  underlying  neurological 
impairment.  Based  on  these  data  recommendations  for  RSV 
prophylaxis  in  this  high  risk  group  have  been  integrated  in 
the  AAP  guidelines  published  2009  [33].  A  more  detailed 
essay is the subject of another chapter in this supplement.  

Immunodeficiency, Immunosuppression 

Patients  with  severe  combined 

 
immune  deficiency 
syndrome  and  those  with  acquired  immune  deficiency 
syndrome  appear 
to  severe, 

to  be  highly  susceptible 

persistent  infections  due  to  a  variety  of  microorganisms,  of 
which  viruses  likely  are  the  most  common.  Infants  show 
prolonged  viral  shedding  and  increased  morbidity  and 
mortality rates associated with RSV infection [37]. RSV was 
recognized  as  a  cause  of  severe  disease  following  bone 
marrow transplantation (BMT). The presence of neutropenia 
and lymphopenia was  identified  as being risk factors for the 
development  of  LRTI  infections.  A  phase-1  study  among 
adult  recipients  of  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation 
(HSCT)  showed  that  intravenous  palivizumab  was  well 
tolerated  among  HSCT  patients  with  and  without  RSV 
infection  [38].  In  infants  a  decision  analysis  model  of 
palivizumab  prophylaxis  to  prevent  RSV  related  mortality 
after  pediatric  BMT  revealed  a  10%  increase  in  survival  in 
infants who had received palivizumab. The absolute survival 
rate increased from 83% to 92% [39]. Hall, et al. (1986) [40] 
described a cohort of immunocompromized children receiving 
anticancer  therapy  and  found  prolonged  viral  shedding  as 
well as higher incidences of LRTI and a higher mortality rate 
(15%)  compared  to  immune  competent  children.  Cole  et  al 
(2001) [41] also reported on a common finding of prolonged 
viral  shedding  in  18  children  with  cancer  and  laboratory 
confirmed RSV infection. Mortality related to RSV infection 
was  low  independent  whether  or  not  specific  antiviral 
therapy was given. These findings were  confirmed by King, 
et  al.  (1993)  [42]  in  infants  with  human  acquired  immuno- 
deficiency  syndrome  (HIV)  and  RSV  infection.  However,  a 
more recent study from South Africa [43] found HIV infected 
children  being  at  increased  risk  of  viral  LRTI  presenting 
more often as viral pneumonia and having a higher mortality 
rate  compared  to  not  HIV  infected  children.  Additionally, 
HIV-  infected  children  showed  a  less  seasonal  associated 
occurrence of RSV infection than non-infected infants.  

  Overall  these  data  suggest  that  infants  following  solid 
organ  or  HSC  transplantation,  infants  with  congenital  
or  acquired  immunodeficiency  and  those  under  immuno- 
suppressive  therapy  are  a  possible  new  target  group  to  for 
RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab.  

  A summary is displayed in Table 4. 

Down Syndrome 

  Down  syndrome  is  the  most  common  chromosomal 
abnormalitiy  and  due  to  it´s  variability  of  immunulogic 
impairments  and  concomitant  respiratory  patholoy  it  is 
associated  with  a  high  risk  of  respiratory  tract  infections.

Bloemers, et al. (2007) [44] reported an incidence of 9,9% in 
children with down syndrome. The rate of hospitalization for 
RSV  was  lower  in  children  with  Down  snydrome  without 
chronic  heart  disease  (7,6%)  than  in  preterm  children  with 
Down  syndrome  (9,4%)  or  children  with  Down  syndrome 
and  significant  chronic  heart  disease  (11,9%).  Disease 
severity  was  not  different  in  children  with  and  without 
additional  risk  factors  such  as  prematurity  or  chronic  heart 
disease.  In  contrast  Hilton,  et  al.  (1999)  suspected  that 
chronic  heart  disease  does  not  influence  the  high  admission 
rate  to  hospital  in  children  with  Down  syndrome,  but  seems 
to  increase  the  severity  of  disease.  Kristensen  (2009)  [36] 
also  showed  in  a  multivariante  analysis  that  children  with 
Down  syndrome  had  an  increased  risk  of  hospitalization  of 
RSV  infection.  A  very  recent  study  by  Bloemers,  et  al. 
(2010)  [45]  showed  that  hospitalization  for  RSV  induced 
respiratory  tract  infections  in  children  with  Down  syndrome 
did  not  significantly  increase  the  risk  of  long-  term  airway 
morbidity,  whereas  in  children  without  Down  syndrome  the 
reportet  association  between  development  of  recurrent 
wheezes  and  severe  RSV  related  respiratory  tract  infection 
was  confirmed.  Unexpectantly  a  high  incidence  of  recurrant 
wheezes  in  children  with  Down  syndrome,  both  with  and 
without  history  of  RSV  related  respiratory  tract  infection, 
was found.  

HOST  RELATED  RISK  FACTORS  INCREASING 
SEVERITIY OF RSV INFECTION 

Age < 6 Months at the Beginning of the RSV Season  

  Young  age  at  the  beginning  of  the  RSV  season  is  a  risk 
factor  for  both  the  development  of  LRTI  as  well  as 
hospitalization due to RSV infection. Several factors play an 
important  role  including  the  immature  immune  system, 
narrow airways and a bias toward a TH2-type response. Law, 
et al. (1998) [46] showed that age below 12 weeks and a GA 
below 37 weeks contributed independently to the severity of 
RSV 
infection.  A  review  of  recent  studies  of  RSV 
hospitalization rates [47] revealed that approximately 10% to 
28%  of  infants  hospitalized  with  RSV  are  aged  below  6 
weeks,  49%  to  70%  below  6  months,  and  66%  to  100% 
below 1 year. The greatest risk factor for hospitalization due 
to  RSV  infection  appears  to  be  the  first  few  months  of  life 
when  they  coincide  with  the  first  half  of  the  RSV  season. 
This  data  was  also  confirmed  by  two  Spanish  studies  from 
the  IRIS  Group  [17,  48]  showing  that  infants  with  a 
chronological  age  below  10  weeks  at  the  onset  of  the  RSV 
season were at higher risk for RSV related hospitalization.

Multiple Birth 

In  a  study  cohort  from  Denver  between  1993  and  1989 
 
twins  and  triplets  were  reported  to  have  a  significantly 
higher  risk  of  sever  RSV  LRTI  and  higher  rates  of  
RSV  related hospitalizations  compared  to  matched  singletons 
[49].  This  finding  was  confirmed  by  a  study  on  hospitaliza- 
tion  rates  in  preterm  infants  aged  29  to  36  weeks  by  Resch, 
et  al.  in  2005  [15]  that  revealed  multiple  gestation  being  a 
risk factor for RSV related hospitalization (odds ratio 5,500, 
CI  95%  1.439-  21.028).  In  the  Spanish  FLIP  and  FLIP-  2 
studies [17,48] multiple birth was not  associated with higher 
rates  of  RSV  related  hospitalizations.  However,  the  authors 
did not perform a multivariate regression analysis. 

Male Sex 

  Male  sex  is  known  to  be  a  risk  factor  for  severe  RSV 
LRTI.  An  analysis  of  representative  studies  over  the  last  30 
years found the risk ratio of boys to girls being 1.425:1 [47]. 
The  reason  therefore  seems  to  be  of  anatomic  nature  that 
boys have shorter and narrower airways and are more likely 
to  develop  bronchial  obstruction  in  case  of  RSV  infection. 
Whereas male sex was regarded as a strong and independent 
risk  factor  for  RSV  related  hospitalization  in  the  Canadian 
PICNIC  study  [16]  this  finding  could  not  be  confirmed  by 
the data of the Spanish FLIP study [48].  

Low Socioeconomic Status and Parental Education 

  Less  parental  education  and  low  socioeconomic  status 
have  also  been  reported  to  be  risk  factors  for  RSV  infection 
[50].  Only  one  study  from  Sweden  in  2002  [51]  examined 
the  role  of  socioeconomic  status  in  a  non-individual  setting 
in  detail  showing  a  positive  correlation  with  the  percentage 
of  immigrants  and  per  capita  income  by  univariate  analysis. 
Several  studies  [48,  52,  53]  however,  could  not  confirm  the 
association  of  less-  educated  mothers  or  parents  with  an 
increased risk for RSV LRTI. In combination with other risk 
factors  maternal  education  was  positively  correlated  with 
RSV  related  hospitalization  in  an  early  epidemiologic  study 
from Tucson in 1991 [54] . 

Crowded Living Conditions /Siblings 

  Both  crowded  living  conditions  and  siblings  appear  to  
be  important  risk  factors  for  more  severe  RSV  LRTI  and 
RSV  related  hospitalization.  Reasons  therefore  include  
the  increased  likelihood  of  exposure  to  the  virus  and 
subsequently  the  increased  risk  for  infection.  Many  studies 
demonstrated  a  significant  effect  of  increased  numbers  of 

Risk Factors for Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus Lower Respiratory Tract Infection 

The Open Microbiology Journal, 2011, Volume 5    149 

persons  sharing  a  bedroom  on  RSV  LRTI  [47].  This  effect 
was  increased  in  families  with  low  maternal  education  and 
even more  in families with low  maternal education who had 
not  breast-fed  their  babies.  School-  and  preschool-aged 
siblings  carry  an  increased  for  the  young  infant  to  acquire 
RSV  infection.  In  the  Canadian  PICNIC  study  [16]  the 
presence  of  preschool-aged  siblings  was  significantly  and 
independently  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  RSV 
related  hospitalization,  and  a  weaker  association  was  found 
with the presence of school-aged siblings. Crowding, defined 
as  5  or  more  people  living  in  one  household,  was  also 
demonstrated  to  be  a  significant  risk  factor  for  RSV  related 
hospitalization. In some contrast the Spanish FLIP study [48] 
revealed  that  only  school-aged  siblings  and  the  presence  of 
more  than  4  additional  residents  and  visitors  at  home  were 
risk  factors  significantly  associated  with  RSV  related 
hospitalization. In the FLIP-2 study [17] the effect of school- 
aged siblings was confirmed but not  crowding by use of the 
same  definition.  The  Munich  RSV  Study  Group  [25]  found 
that  siblings  at  day  care  attendance  significantly  augmented 
the risk for RSV related hospitalization. 

Maternal Smoking and Indoor Smoke Pollution 

 
Studies on  the  influence of smoking  in  the household on 
the  risk  of  bronchiolitis  and  RSV  LRTI  associated 
hospitalization  are  conflicting  [47,55].  The  Spanish  FLIP 
[48]  and  FLIP-2  [17]  studies  revealed  that  the  presence  of 
more than two smokers at home was associated with a higher 
risk  of  RSV  related  hospitalization  by  bivariate  analysis. 
Also  The  Canadian  PICNIC-  Study  [16]  reported  household 
exposure  to  cigarette  smoke  from  2  or  more  smokers  being 
predictive  for  RSV  related  hospitalization.  The  inconsistent 
evidence  on  the  effect  of  tobacco  smoke  exposure  on  RSV 
LRTI  needs  further  evaluation,  and  hence,  the  AAP  stated 
that  the  term  air  pollution  better  might  characterize  this  risk 
factor [33]. 

on  the  other  hand  a  disposition  to  asthma  causing  recurrent 
wheezing is also a cause of debate. In the Canadian PICNIC- 
study  [16]  a  history  of  eczema  in  a  first  degree  family 
member was found to be an independent protective factor for 
RSV hospitalization. However, no association was found for 
family  history  wheezing  or  any  other  allergic  disorder.  Data 
from  the  Spanish  FLIP-2-  study  [17]  confirmed  these 
findings  showing  that  a  family  history  of  wheezing  did  not 
reach  statistical  significance.  In  the  previous  FLIP-  study 
[48]  however,  the  history  of  wheezing  in  the  family  was 
found to be of statistical significance, whereas the interaction 
between a history of asthma or eczema in the family did not 
reach  statistical  significance  in  the  multivariate  logistic 
regression analysis.  

Low cord Serum Antibody Titers 

  High  titers  of  maternally  derived  RSV  neutralizing 
antibodies  are  inversely  associated  with  the  incidence  of 
acute RSV LRI during the first six months of life. In preterm 
infants  incomplete  maternally  antibody  transfer  has  been 
implicated to increase the risk for severe RSV infection [56]. 
RSV  peak  activity  during  winter  epidemics  appear  to  be 
associated  with  decreased  herd  immunity  in  the  population, 
especially among mothers. In case of high maternal antibody 
titers  during  the  latter  part  of  the  RSV  season,  infants  born 
during  this  period  might  be  protected.  Babies  conceived  at 
the end of a RSV season may have lower antibody titers due 
to  a  natural  decline  of  antibodies  during  the  year  and  thus 
might  be  more  susceptible  to  RSV  disease  at  the  time  of 
birth  [57]  A  recent  study  from  Stensballe,  et  al.  (2009)  [56] 
showed a temporal association of cord- blood RSV antibody 
levels  and rate of hospitalization for  RSV  in  infants under  6 
months  of  age 
incidence  of  RSV 
hospitalization  increased  when  RSV  antibody  titers  (to  the 
log  base  2)  declined  below  7.5,  and  the  RSV  epidemic 
peaked shortly after the nadir of the mean antibody level 

in  Denmark.  The 

Malnutrition/Small for Gestational Age 

Living at Altitude 

  The  role  of  malnutrition  has  not  been  studied  in 
industrialized  nations.  The  only  existing  studies  looking  at 
these  risk  factors  were  carried  out  in  developing  countries. 
All  of  them  conclude  that  RSV  was  less  frequently 
diagnosed  in  malnourished  compared  to  well-nourished 
children. Thus, malnutrition has not been proven to be a risk 
factor  for  the  development  of  RSV  LRTI.  The  suspected 
reason  for  that  phenomenon  might  be  that  a  lower  immune 
response  provides  protection  against  severe  RSV  disease 
[47].  Although  low  birth  weight  is  recognized  as  a  risk  
factor  for  severe  RSV  disease  the  role  of  intrauterine  
growth  restriction  has  only  been  examined  in  the  Canadian 
PICNIC-  Study  [16]  being  an  independent  risk  factor  for 
hospitalization  for  RSV  infection.  However,  intrauterine 
growth  restriction  was  found  to  be  a  risk  for  death  due  to 
RSV disease in developing countries [47].  

  An  analysis  comparing  hospitalization  rates  for  children 
at 3 altitude categories (<1500 m; 1500–2500 m; and >2500 
m)  found  that  infants  living  at  altitudes  higher  than  2500  m 
were 33%  more likely to be hospitalized (relative risk [RR]: 
1.30; P <.018) than those at moderate altitudes, with 1- to 4-
year-old  children  exhibiting  an  80%  increase  in  their 
hospitalization  rates  (RR:  1.80;  P  <.001)  [58].  Altitude  can 
have  numerous  respiratory  effects  including  lower  oxygen 
saturation  values,  impaired  ciliary  activity,  and  hypoxia-
related pulmonary vasoconstriction.  

  A  summary  of  the  host  related  risk  factors  of  RSV  is 
displayed in Table 5. 

RISK FACTORS FOR ACQUISITION OF RSV 

Birth before or during RSV Season 

Family History of Atopy of Asthma 

  The association of RSV infection with a family history of 
allergic disorders is discussed controversial. On the one hand 
RSV  is  a  major  cause  of  recurrent  wheezing  and  “asthma” 
during  the  following  years  after  an  first  severe  RSV  LRTI, 

  As  mentioned  above  birth  during  the  first  half  of  the  
RSV  season  is  a  risk  factor  for  RSV  LRTI  requiring 
hospitalization.  One  aspect  is  that  birth  shortly  before  and 
early after onset of  RSV season results  in a longer  exposure 
period to RSV at a very young age. Another aspect is the fact 
that  maternal  antibodies  titers  to  RSV  show  a  seasonal

variation  with  lower  levels  within  the  first  half  of  the  RSV 
season  due  to  the  fact  that  mothers  have  not  been  exposed  
to  RSV  for  a  longer  time  period.  In  the  Canadian  PICNIC 
study  [41]  the  logistic  regression  analysis  showed  that  
birth  between  November  and  January  was  one  of  the  five 
independent  predictors  for  the  increased  risk  of  RSV 
hospitalization. This data was also confirmed by the Munich 
RSV  Study  Group  [19]  Risk  factor  analysis  revealed  that 
discharge  between  October  and  December  was  associated 
with  a  higher  risk  for  RSV  hospitalization  (OR  2.1;  
0,99-  4,4;  P=0,05).  The  two  Spanish  FLIP  and  FLIP-  2 
studies,  [38,  39]  however,  demonstrated  that  infants  with  
a  chronological  age  below  3  months  or  less  at  onset  of  
RSV  season  were  at  higher  risk  for  RSV  hospitalization. 

Discharge  from  the  NICU  during  RSV  season  was  not  a 
single significant risk factor. 

Day  Care  Attendance/  Older  Siblings  in  School  or  
Day-Care 

 
In  the  past  the  attendance  of  infants  and  young  children 
in a child care setting or a day care group was regarded as a 
significant  risk  factor  for  acquisition  of  LRTI.  Henderson,  
et  al.  (1979)  [50]  already  described  that  nearly  all  103 
healthy  children,  who  did  not  have  prior  exposure  to  RSV, 
became infected in a day- care setting during a 10- year time 
period.  Several  further  studies  confirmed  this  association 
[37]  Liese,  et  al.  [19]  from  the  Munich  RSV  Study  Group 

Risk Factors for Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus Lower Respiratory Tract Infection 

The Open Microbiology Journal, 2011, Volume 5    151 

found  that  the  presence  of  siblings  in  day-care  attendance 
increased the risk factor for RSV rehospitalisation in preterm 
infants (cid:1)35 weeks gestational age significantly, whereas day-
care  attendance  of  the  child  itself  was  not  a  significant  risk 
factor.  In  the  Canadian  PICNIC  study  [41]  day-care-
attendance  of  children  was  the  single  greatest  risk  factor  in 
preterm  infants  born  at  a  gestational  age  of  33-  35  weeks, 
whereas  the  two  Spanish  studies-  FLIP  and  FLIP-2  study 
[38,39]  revealed  no  significant  association  between  RSV 
hospitalization  and  day-  care  attendance  in  this  age  group. 
This  was  partly  explained  by  the  limited  utilization  of  day-
care centres in the study population (<5%).  

Lack of Breast Feeding 

  The role of breast-feeding in preventing RSV disease and 
hospitalization  for  RSV  is  undisputed.  However  data  about 
the  specific  protective  effect  of  breast-  feeding  on  RSV 
infection  are  conflicting.  The  reason  for  its  protective  effect 
is attributed to RSV- IgA and lactoferrin in the breast milk as 
well  as  to  the  fact  that  breast  milk  promotes  maturation 
probably  through  the  influence  of  prolactin.  The  Spanish 
FLIP-  Study  [38]  found  breast  feeding  for  >2  months 
protective  against  RSV  hospitalization  whereas  the  FLIP-2 
Study  [39]  did  not  show  a  protective  effect  against  RSV. 
Again  in  the  Canadian  PICNIC  –  Study  [41]  absence  of 
breast feeding was not found to be  an independent predictor 
for  RSV-  infection.  However,  some  studies  indicate  that  the 
absence  of  breast-feeding  in  combination  with  other  risk 
factors  like  crowding,  passive  smoke  exposure  or  low 
socioeconomic  status  significantly  increases  the  risk  for 
development of RSV LRTI [37].  

  A  summary  of  risk  factors  for  acquisition  of  RSV  is 
displayed in Table 6. 

MODELS  FOR  PREDICTING  RSV  IN  THE  LATE 
PRETERM INFANTS 

  Given  the  high  cost  of  RSV  prophylaxis,  especially  for 
the large population of late preterm infants, an algorithm that 

Table 6.  Risk Factors for RSV Acquisition  

could  identify  high-risk  infants  with  significant  specificity 
and  sensitivity  could  support 
the  evidence  base  for 
recommendations for treatment of this group. Since the AAP 
had already made broad recommendations for prophylaxis of 
children  in  the  33-35  wGA  group,  we  aimed  to  develop  
an  European  model  for  predicting  which  premature  infants 
33  to  35  weeks  gestational  age  were  at  highest  risk  for 
hospitalization.  Initially  we  used  data  from  Spain  and 
Germany  [58]  to  develop  the  model  then  we  validated  the 
scoring  system  using  studies  from  Denmark  [59],  France 
[60] and Italy[61]. 

  The  model  assigns  individual  weights  to  the  7  most 
predictive factors from the FLIP study: birth ±10 weeks from 
the  beginning  of  the  RSV  season;  birth  weight;  breast  fed  2 
or  fewer  months;  number  of  siblings  aged  2  years  or  older; 
number  of  family  members  with  atopy;  number  of  family 
members  with  wheezing;  and  sex  [59,60,61,62].  In  the 
original  study,  information  on  these  7  factors  examined  by 
discriminant  function  analysis  resulted  in  a  diagnostic 
accuracy  of  71%  when  trying  to  identify  premature  infants 
hospitalized  with  RSV.  Discriminant  function  analysis 
optimizes which variables discriminate between two or more 
naturally  occurring  groups,  here  RSV-hospitalized  vs.  non-
RSV-hospitalized  premature  infants  33  to  35  wGA.  The 
summary  diagnostic  accuracies  of  the  initial  model  derived 
from  the  FLIP  2  study  as  well  as  the  validations  from 
Munich, France, Italy and Denmark are presented in Table 7. 
It  is  currently  being  implemented  in  some  countries  to 
determine  the  most  effective  application  of  palivizumab  in 
this population.  

 
Sampalis,  et  al.  [63]  also  developed  a  scoring  system, 
based  on  a  logistic  regression  model,  using  prospectively 
collected  data  on  1758  Canadian  infants  33-35wGA,  66  of 
whom  were  hospitalized,and  validated  using  the  FLIP  2 
study  data.  The  risk  score  also  included  7  risk  factors  and 
cutoff scores of 0-48, 49-64, and 65- 100 for low-, moderate-, 
and  high-risk  subjects,  respectively.  The  sensitivity  and 
specificity for predicting RSV hospitalization were 68% and 
72%,  respectively,  with  the  Canadian  data  and  62%  and

study  using  this  scoring  tool  [64],  in  430  children  over  3 
seasons,  346  infants  in  the  low  risk  group  received  no

latter  group  was 
received  prophylaxis.  None  of

tool identified most high risk babies for prophylaxis since the 
overall  rate  of  hospitalization  was  5/430  (1.2%)  compared  
to  the  rate  of  66/1758  (3.7%)  [65]  in  the  multicenter  study
