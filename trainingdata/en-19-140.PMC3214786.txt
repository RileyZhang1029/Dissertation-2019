ABSTRACT

Berberine  is  an  isoquinoline  alkaloid  isolated  from  goldenthread,  Coptidis  Rhizoma 
and  shown  to  have  many  biological  and  pharmacological  effects.  We  previously  re-
ported  that  berberine  promotes  cell  survival  and  differentiation  of  neural  stem  cells.  To 
examine  whether  berberine  has  survival  promoting  effect  on  damaged  neuronal  cells, 
we  generated  a  cellular  model  under  oxidative  stress  and  an  neonatal  animal  model  of 
degenerating  brain  disease  by  injecting  MK-801.  MK801,  a  noncompetitive  antagonist 
of  N-methyl-d-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptors,  acts  as  a  neurotoxin  in  developing  rats  by 
inhibiting  NMDA  receptors  and  induce  neuronal  cell  death.  We  found  that  the  survival 
rate  of  the  SH-SY5Y  cells  under  oxidative  stress  was  increased  by  287%  and  344%, 
when  treated  with  1.5  and  3.0μg/ml  berberine,  respectively.  In  the  developing  rats  in-
jected  by  MK801,  we  observed  that  TUNEL  positive  apoptotic  cells  were  outspread  in 
entire  brain.  The  cell  death  was  decreased  more  than  3  fold  in  the  brains  of  the 
MK-801-induced  neurodegenerative  animal  model  when  berberine  was  treated  to  the 
model  animals.  This  suggests  that  berberine  promotes  activity  dependent  cell  survival 
mediated  by  NMDA  receptor  because  berberine  is  known  to  activate  neurons  by 
blocking  K＋  current  or  lowering  the  threshold  of  the  action  potential.  Taken  together, 
berberine  has  neuroprotective  effect  on  damaged  neurons  and  neurodegenerating 
brains  of  neonatal  animal  model  induced  by  MK-801  administration.

INTRODUCTION

    Berberine  is  an  isoquinoline  alkaloid  and  often 
isolated  from  goldenthread,  Coptidis  Rhizoma,  and 
goldenseal,  Hydrastis  Canadensis  (Mirska  et  al., 
1972).  Previous  reports  have  shown  that  berberine 
has  several  pharmacological  and  biological  pro-
perties  including  antibiotic  (Mirska  et  al.,  1972),

anti-inflammatory  (Marinova  et  al.,  2000;  Zhou  and 
Mineshita,  2000;  Yoo  et  al.,  2008)  and  anti-hypo-
lipidemic  (Kong  et  al.,  2004)  effects.  It  has  been 
reported  that  berberine  attenuated  neuronal  damage 
in  ischemia/reperfusion  model  (Yoo  et  al.,  2006), 
and  in  autoimmune  encephalomyelitis  model  mice 
(Ma  et  al.,  2010).  Berberine  showed  neuroprotective 
effects  on  stroke  models  (Zhou  et  al.,  2008)  and 
focal  cerebral  ischemia  injury  (Xiao  et  al.,  2007). 
Previously,  we  reported  that  berberine  enhances 
neuronal  cell  survival  and  differentiation  in  hip-
pocampal  precursor  cells  and  neurons  in  the  rat 
brains  (Lim,  2008).  Tan  and  his  colleges  (2007) 

showed  that  berberine  has  an  antioxidant  action  on 
corpus  cavenosum  smooth  muscle  cells  in  which 
oxidative  stress  were  induced  (Tan  et  al.,  2007). 
    To  examine  whether  berberine  has  survival  pro-
moting  effect  on  damaged  neuronal  cells,  we  ge-
nerated  a  degenerating  brain  disease  model  by 
injecting  neurotoxin 
to  developing  rats.  MK-801 
[(5S,10R)-(＋)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo 
[a,d]  cyclohepten-5,10-imine  maleate,  dizocilpine]  is 
a  noncompetitive  antagonist  of  N-methyl-d-aspartate 
(NMDA)  receptors  (Wong  et  al.,  1986;  Javitt  and 
Zukin,  1991).  In  rodents,  MK-801  induces  a  be-
havioral  syndrome,  including  hyperlocomotion,  head 
weaving,  body  rolling,  and  ataxia  (Clineschmidt  et 
al.,  1982;  Tricklebank  et  al.,  1989;  Liljequist  et  al., 
1991),  which  represents  certain  aspects  of  schi-
zophrenia  (Carlsson  and  Carlsson,  1990;  Tiedtke  et 
al.,  1990).  MK-801  is  also  known  to  induce  neu-
rodegeneration  of  hippocampal  CA1  and  entorhinal 
cortex  in  adult  animals  when  administrated  with 
high  concentrations  (10  mg/kg)  of  MK-801  (Wohrl  et 
al.,  2007). 
    In  the  developing  rat  brain,  blockade  of  NMDA 
receptors  with  low  dose  of  MK801  during  late  fetal 
or  early  neonatal  life  triggers  widespread  apoptotic 
neurodegeneration  (12∼26%  of  cells)  (Ikonomidou 
et  al.,  1999).  This  suggests  the  transient  blockade 
of  NMDA  receptors  can  trigger  neuronal  cell  death 
in  the  immature  mammalian  brain  during  a  period 
of  rapid  axonal  growth  and  synaptogenesis,  and 
the  excitatory  neurotransmitter  glutamate,  acting  at 
NMDA  receptors,  controls  neuronal  survival.  Thus, 
Neurodegenerative  MK-801  model  of  the  developing 
rat  has  relevance  to  human  neurodevelopmental 
disorders  involving  postnatal  exposure  to  drugs  that 
block  NMDA  receptors  such  as  pediatric  anesthesia.
    Berberine  has  been  reported  to  increase  action 
potential  by  inhibition  of  voltage  dependent  potas-
sium  current  in  cat  ventricular  myocytes  (Huang, 
1990;  Sanchez-Chapula,  1996)  and  in  human  mye-
loma  cells  (Wu  et  al.,  1998)  and  hepatocytes 
(Wang  et  al.,  2003).  Berberine  suppresses  dopa-
mine-induced  potassium  current  and  acetylcholine 
induced  potassium  current  in  acutely  dissociated 
CA1  pyramidal  neurons  (Wu  and  Jin,  1996;  1997). 
It  is  also  suggested  that  berberine  contributes  to  its 
blockades  of  potassium  currents  in  damaged  is-
chemic  brain  (Wang  et  al.,  2004).  This  leads  us  a 

Berberine  Effect  on  Damaged  Neonatal  Rat  Brain 141

question  whether  berberine  reduces  cell  death  on 
damaged  brain  of  developing  animal  model  rats 
induced  by  MK801.  We  tested  first  the  cell  survival 
promoting  effect  of  berberine  on  SH-SY5Y  neuronal 
cells  damaged  by  oxidative  stress  and 
then 
examined  whether  berberine  blocks  cell  death  in 
vivo  developing  rat  model  induced  by  MK801. 

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

Cell  culture

    Human  neuroblastoma  SH-SY5Y  cells  were  ac-
quired  from  ATCC.  As  previously  described,  SH- 
SY5Y  cells  were  maintained  in  Dulbecco’s  modified 
Eagle’s  medium  (DMEM,  Invitrogen,  USA)  supple-
mented  with  10%  fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS,  Thermo, 
USA),  penicillin,  and  streptomycin  at  37oC  (Heo  et 
al.,  2009).  For  the  SH-SY5Y  cells  0.1  mM  MEM 
non-essential  amino  acids  were  also  added.

Cell  viability  assay

    To  estimate  damage  of  cultured  cells  which 
caused  by  oxidative  stress,  we  performed  cell 
viability  assay  by  using  3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 
2,5-diphenyltetrazolium  bromide  (MTT,  Sigma-Ald-
rich,  USA).  SH-SY5Y  cells  were  seeded  at  a 
density  of  7.5×103  cells  in  96-well  plate.  Cells  were 
treated  with  different  concentration  (0.25,  1.5,  3  and 
3.5μg/ml)  of  berberine  chloride  (Sigma-  Aldrich, 
USA).  4  mg/ml  of  MTT  tetrazolium  salt  was  added 
to  each  well  and  incubated  for  4  hrs  at  37oC.  After 
that,  100μl  of  solubilization  buffer  was  added  and 
then  incubated  for  24  hrs.  Result  were  measured 
by  ELISA  (Molecular  devices,  USA). 

Neonatal  animal  model  of  neuronal  cell  da-
maged  by  MK-801  injection

    Sprague  Dawley  rats  were  maintained  under 
standard  housing  conditions  and  a  12：12  light/dark 
cycle  (lights  on  at  06:30  AM)  with  free  access  to 
water  and  standard 
food.  All  procedures  were 
performed  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  of  the 
National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  for  the  care  and 
use  of  laboratory  animals.  The  neonatal  rat  model 
of  developmental  disorder  was  constructed  as 
described  previously  (Ikonomidou  et  al.,  1999).  In 
brief,  postnatal  day  7  animals  were  randomly  di-
vided  into  a  control  group  (n=3)  and  a  group 

142 Taehwan  Lee,  et  al.

injected 

injected  with  MK-801  (dizocilpine  0.5  mg/kg  of  body 
weight;  Sigma,  St.  Louis,  MO,  USA),  NMDA  re-
ceptor  antagonist  (n=3).  MK-801  was  dissolved  in 
0.9%  saline  and 
intraperitoneally  (i.p.). 
Control  rats  received  saline  only.  Berberine  chloride 
were  dissolved  in  0.9%  saline  and  injected  intra-
peritoneally  every  24  hours  for  5  days  and  control 
rats  received  saline  again.  The  degenerating  brains 
were  examined  at  5th  day  by  TUNEL  (terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl  transferase-mediated  dUTP  nick- 
end  labeling)  assay  to  detect  apoptotic  cells.

TUNEL  assay

    To  visualize  nuclei  with  DNA  cleavage,  brain 
were  cut  using  a  vibratome  and  brain  slices  were 
incubated  with  0.1%  Triton  X-100  in  0.1%  sodium 
for  2  min  on  4oC. 
citrate  (permeable  solution) 
Subsequently  brain  slices  were 
incubated  with 
nucleotide-labeling  mixture  and  terminal  deoxynu-
cleotidyl  transferase  (Roche,  Switzerland)  for  1  hr 
at  37oC 
to  catalytically  add  peroxidase-labeled 
digoxigenin  nucleotide  to  DNA  fragments.  Nuclei 
displaying  DNA  cleavage  had  a  dark  brown  ap-
pearance.  We  counted  the  number  of  TUNEL  po-
sitive  cells  in  the  microscophic  fields  (n=12).

RESULTS

    In  the  previous  study,  we  have  demonstrated  that 
berberine  promotes  cell  survival  in  neuronal  stem 
cells.  To  investigate  the  cell  survival  effect  of  ber-
berine  on  damaged  neurons,  we  examined  ber-
berine  effect  in  the  cultured  cellular  model  under 
the  condition  of  oxidative  stress.  SH-SY5Y  cells 
were  exposed  under  oxidative  stress  by  adding  150
μM  H2O2  for  30  min  after  being  pretreated  with 
0.25∼3.5μg/ml  of  berberine  for  3  hrs.  When  serum 
is  removed  from  media  and  changed  to  chemically 
defined  N2  media  survival  of  SH-SY5Y  cells  are 
reduced  and  initiates  neurite  outgrowth.  As  shown 
in  Fig.  1,  the  survival  rate  of  the  groups  treated  by 
1.5  and  3.0μg/ml  berberine  was 
increased  by 
287%  and  344%,  respectively  compared  to  the  N2 
media  control.  However,  the  survival  rate  of  the 
groups  treated  by  3.5μg/ml  berberine  was  re-
duced  to  about  200%,  the  similar  level  of  0.25
μg/ml  concentration,  suggesting  that  higher  con-
centration  is  not  more  effective. 

    To  determine  the  protective  effect  of  berberine  in 
the  damaged  neuronal  cells  of  developing  animal 
model,  we  generated  neonatal  animal  model  of 
degenerating  brain  by  injecting  intraperitoneally  to 
postnatal  day  7  aged  rats  0.5  mg/kg  of  MK-801, 
which  is  a  non-competitive  antagonist  of  the  N- 
methyl-d-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptor,  as  described 
previously  (Ikonomidou  et  al.,  1999).  As  described 
previously,  we  also  observed  changes  of  cell  shape 
including  intracytoplasmatic  vacuoles  in  the  cortex 
of  rats  treated  with  a  low  dose  of  MK-801  (0.5 
mg/kg  body  weight)  when  stained  with  haematoxylin 
and  eosin  (Olney  et  al.,  1989;  Fix  et  al.,  1994).  We 
intraperitoneally  injected  20  mg/kg  of  berberine,  or 
vehicle,  to  the  model  animals  for  5  days.  After 
sacrificing  the  animals,  the  brain  slices  were  pre-
pared  to  perform  TUNEL  assay  (Fig.  2).  TUNEL 
positive  apoptotic  cells  were  outspread  in  entire 
brain  of  the  developing  rats  injected  by  MK801.
    However,  the  cell  death  was  decreased  more 
than  3  fold  in  the  brains  of  berberine  admini-
strated  animals.  The  number  of  TUNEL  positive 
cells  of  the  control  group  were  27×102  cells  per 
microscophic  field  (×200;  Vehicle  n=3,  BER  n=3), 
on  the  other  hand,  the  number  of  TUNEL  positive 
cells  of  the  berberine  group  were  7×102  cells  per 
microscophic  field  (×200;  Vehicle  n=3,  BER  n=3).

Fig.  1.  Neuronal  cell  viability  was  improved  by  berberine  treat-
ment  in  cultured  SH-SY5Y  cells  under  oxidative  stress  induced 
by  hydrogen  peroxide  (H2O2).  SH-SY5Y  cells  were  pretreated 
with  berberine  (BER,  0.25,  1.5,  3  and  3.5μg/ml)  3  hours  before 
H2O2  treatment  (150μM,  30  min)  in  chemically  defined  N2 
media.  SH-SY5Y  cells  treated  with  retinoic  acid  (RA,  5μM) 
represents  positive  control.  Cell  survival  was  measured  by  MTT 
assay  and  cell  viability  was  normalized  to  H2O2  added  control.

DISCUSSION

    Recently,  berberine  is  shown  to  enhance  cell 
survival  by  reducing  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS), 
the  release  of  cytochrome  c  and  apoptosis-inducing 
factors  (AIFs)  in  PC12  cells  damaged  by  oxygen- 
glucose  deprivation  (Zhou  et  al.,  2008).  In  this 
report  we  have  demonstrated  that  survival  pro-
moting  effect  of  berberine  in  both  damaged    neu-
ronal  cell  model  and  degenerating  brain  of  neonatal 
animal  model.  SH-SY5Y  cell  culture  model  induced 
by  adding  H2O2  are  well  established  as  a  damaged 
neuronal  cell  model  for  ischemic  studies.  Ischemic 
conditions  induce  apoptosis  by  generating  excessive 
ROS  (Zhang  et  al.,  2009).  We  found  berberine  in-
creases  cell  viability  of  SH-SY5Y  under  oxidative 
stress  about  3  fold.  This  result  implies  the  anti- 
apoptotic  effect  of  berberine  under  oxidative  stress 

condition.
    We  also  found  the  anti-apoptotic  effect  of  ber-
berine  in  the  MK801  induced  animal  model.  To 
make  the  model  animals,  we  injected  low  dose  of 
MK-801  into  the  developing  postnatal  day  7  rats, 
and  MK801  induced  TUNEL  positive  apoptotic  cells 
were  found  in  entire  brain  of  the  developing  rats  as 
Ikonomidou  and  his  colleges  previously  described 
(1999).  Although  half  life  of  MK-801,  NMDA  re-
ceptor  anatagoist  is  only  for  a  few  hours  (Vezzani 
et  al.,  1989),  neuronal  apoptosis  in  the  immature 
mammalian  brain  can  be  triggered  by  the  transient 
blockade  of  glutamate  NMDA  receptors.  This  is 
probably  caused  by  mechanism  of  activity  de-
pendant  cell  survival  which  is  induced  by  release  of 
neurotransmitter,  glutamate  and  activation  of  NMDA 
receptor  on  target  cells.  Activation  of  the  NMDA 
receptor  by  glutamate  on  post-synaptic  neurons 

144 Taehwan  Lee,  et  al.

releases  retrograde  signal  which  is  required  for  cell 
survival  of  presynaptic  neurons.  During  a  period  of 
rapid  brain  growth  or  synaptogenesis  period,  such 
target  derived  survival  signals  from  post-synaptic 
neurons  regulate  strengthening  of  the  synapses  as 
well  as  cell  survival  of  pre  and  post-synaptic  neu-
rons,  thereby  forming  neuronal  networks.  Blockage 
of  NMDA  receptors  inhibits  to  produce  target  de-
rived  survival  factors  and  cause  apoptosis  of  pre 
and  post-synaptic  neurons.
    When  berberine  was 
the  MK801 
model  rats,  apoptotic  cells  were  decreased  more 
than  3  fold.  Other  researcher  group  also  reported 
neuroprotective  action  of  berberine  in  organotypic 
hippocampal  slice  culture  induced  by  oxygen  and 
glucose  deprivation  (Cui  et  al.,  2009).  Berberine 
has  also  been  reported  to  block  transient  outward 
potassium  current  (IA)  and  delayed  rectifier  potas-
sium  current  (IK)  in  acutely  isolated  CA1  pyramidal 
neurons  of  rat  hippocampus  by  using  the  whole-cell 
patch-clamp  techniques.  These  biological  functions 
were  suggested  as  a  protective  mechanism  against 
ischemic  brain  damage  (Wang  et  al.,  2004).  In  our 
animal  model  of  neonatal  brain  damaged  by  NMDA 
receptor  antagonist,  MK801,  berberine  probably  sti-
mulates  cell  survival  of  neuronal  cells  expressing 
NMDA  receptors  by  blocking  potassium  current  or 
lowering  the  threshold  of  the  action  potential.  This 
may  elevate  synaptic  depolarization  and  activate 
channel  opening  of  NMDA  receptors  and  calcium 
influx.
    Thus,  we  suggest  that  these  anti-apoptotic  effect 
of  berberine  on  the  neurodegenerating  brain  of 
neonatal  animal  model  caused  by  promoting  activity 
dependent  cell  survival.   
    In  the  immature  mammalian  brain  during  a  period 
of  rapid  synaptogenesis,  the  transient  blockade  of 
glutamate  NMDA  receptors,  or  the  excessive  ac-
tivation  of  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA(A))  re-
ceptors 
trigger  neuronal  apoptosis.  Apoptogenic 
agents  include  anesthetics  and  drugs  of  abuse 
including  phencyclidine,  ketamine,  and  ethanol.  In 
humans,  the  brain  growth  period  are  between  the 
sixth  month  of  pregnancy  and  the  third  year  after 
birth.  Agents  used 
in  pediatric  and  obstetrical 
medicine  for  purposes  of  sedation,  anesthesia,  and 
seizure  management  may  cause  apoptotic  neuronal 
degeneration  in  the  developing  human  brain  such 

as  dysmorphogenic  changes  in  the  fetal  brain  and 
consequent  neurobehavioral  disturbances.   
    In  conclusion,  berberine  has  cell  survival  pro-
moting  effect  on  damaged  neuronal  cells  under 
oxidative  stress  and  degenerating  brains  of  de-
veloping  animal  model  induced  by  MK801.
