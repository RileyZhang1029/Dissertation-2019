Abstract
Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is generally considered to be a regulator of T cell homeostasis because it
works with other common gamma-chain cytokines like IL-2 and IL-7 to control the maintenance of
naive and memory T cell populations. However, recent reports highlight new roles for IL-15 during
the primary immune responses that involve promoting the survival of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.
These findings illuminate a previously unanticipated role for IL-15 in the generation and resolution of
the effector CD8+ T cell response to pathogens.

Introduction and context
IL-15 plays a pivotal role in T-cell activation and effector
functions, including T cell proliferation [1], interferon-g
and tumor necrosis factor-a production [2,3], chemokine
production [4], and cytotoxicity [5]. In combination with
other common gamma-chain cytokines, IL-15 also influ-
ences memory T cell homeostasis through the regulation
of memory T cell numbers [6-8]. In this context, IL-15
drives the generation of antigen-specific memory T cells
[8], promotes the survival of memory CD8+ T cells [9], and
stimulates the homeostatic proliferation of memory
phenotype CD8+ T cells [10-12]. Recent publications
have described new roles for IL-15 in primary immune
responses, where it provides a survival signal to effector
CD8+ T cells during primary responses to pathogens
[13,14].

Major recent advances
Recently, Sanjabi et al. [14] demonstrated that trans-
forming growth factor-b (TGF-b) and IL-15 have oppos-
ing effects on the survival of the short-lived effector T
cells (defined on the basis of KLRG1 [killer cell lectin-like
receptor G1] and CD127 expression). Using a model
system of Listeria monocytogenes infection, the authors
demonstrated that TGF-b promoted apoptosis of effector
CD8+ T cells whereas IL-15 promoted their survival. The
opposing effects of TGF-b and IL-15 were not a result of
direct inhibition of signaling in the respective signaling

pathways; rather, the differential survival appeared to
result from the competing effects of these pathways on
the anti-apoptosis molecule Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2).
Importantly, these data supported a role for IL-15 in
promoting the survival of effector T cells during the
contraction phase of the T-cell response to infection.

This concept was extended by McGill et al. [15], who
revealed a role for IL-15 in promoting the survival of
antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the lung after influenza
virus infection. Using a dendritic cell (DC) depletion/
reconstitution model, their previous work had demon-
strated that influenza-specific CD8+ T cell responses
in the lung depended on T-cell
interactions with
pulmonary DCs [15]. When pulmonary DCs were
depleted using clodronate-liposomes, antigen-specific
CD8+ T cell responses were decreased, and the virus
was not cleared as efficiently. The blunting of the CD8+
T-cell response was not due to reduced proliferation of
T cells in the absence of DC signals, as DC depletion did
not significantly alter the proliferation of antigen-specific
CD8+ T cells responding to the infection. Instead, it
appeared that the pulmonary DCs were promoting the
survival of
the antigen-specific T cells in the lung
environment. This enhanced CD8+ T-cell survival was
dependent on trans-presentation of IL-15/IL-15 receptor
(IL-15R) complexes by pulmonary DCs, as blocking
IL-15 or IL-15R on DCs resulted in increased CD8+

T-cell apoptosis in the lung. Together, these data support
a two-hit model for promoting effective CD8+ T cell
responses: a first hit in the lymph node that primes T-cell
proliferation and migration to infected tissue, and a
second hit that provides a survival signal to the effector
T cells.

Future directions
While IL-15 has been best-appreciated for its contribu-
tions to memory T cell homeostasis, these new findings
highlight the importance of IL-15 in promoting the
survival of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells during primary
responses to infection and suggest several areas for
further investigation. First, the location of the DC-T-cell
interaction that promotes the survival of the CD8+ T cells
needs to be determined. One possibility is that IL-15
trans-presentation by DCs takes place in inducible
bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue that develops in
the lungs after infection [16]. Alternatively, the DC-T-cell
interactions could take place in the lung-draining lymph
node, as the pulmonary DC subsets continue to migrate
to the lung-draining lymph node through day 9 post-
infection [17]. Second, the importance of IL-15 for the
survival of memory T cell populations during a secondary
pathogen challenge needs to be examined [18,19].
Finally, the contribution of IL-15 trans-presentation
to the survival of CD4+ T cells during the primary
immune response to pathogens needs to be determined.
In this regard, IL-15 promotes the activation of CD4+
T cells – including their cytokine production [20], CD154
expression [21], proliferation [22], and the maintenance
of memory populations [23] – yet the effect of IL-15 on
CD4+ T-cell survival during primary immune responses is
unknown.

Manipulating T cell survival via the IL-15 pathway offers
the potential
for the development of novel disease
therapies. One such therapeutic approach was recently
reported by Wang et al. [24], who alleviated joint
inflammation in a model of arthritis by targeting toxins
to IL-15R-expressing cells. This report revealed the
potential for elimination of immunopathogenic T cells
and offers a possible therapeutic pathway to treat T-cell-
mediated diseases like multiple sclerosis or
type
I diabetes. Alternatively, the anti-apoptotic effects of
IL-15 could also be utilized to enhance survival of
effector T cells. Toward this end, Hoyos et al. [25]
engineered tumor-specific T cells with an IL-15 construct,
which enhanced T-cell survival and resulted in improved
anti-tumor effects. Together, these studies reveal the
potential for therapies targeting the IL-15 pathway in the
treatment of disease and reinforce a role for IL-15 in
promoting the survival of effector CD8+ T cells during
the immune response.
