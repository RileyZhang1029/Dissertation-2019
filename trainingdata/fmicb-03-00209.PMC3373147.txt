Genetic diversity of phylogenetic or functional markers is widely used as a proxy of micro-
bial diversity. However, it remains unclear to what extent functional diversity (FD), gene
sequence diversity and community functioning are linked. For a range of denitrifying bac-
teria, we analyzed the relationships between (i) the similarity of functional traits evaluated
from metabolic proﬁles (BIOLOG plates) or from N2O accumulation patterns on different
carbon sources and (ii) the similarity of phylogenetic (16S rRNA gene) or functional (nir
gene) markers. We also calculated different proxies for the diversity of denitriﬁer com-
munity based on taxa richness, phylogenetic (16S rRNA gene) or functional similarities
(based either on metabolic proﬁles or N2O accumulation patterns), and evaluated their
performance in inferring the functioning of assembled denitrifying communities. For indi-
vidual strains, the variation in the 16S rRNA gene sequence was weakly correlated with
the variation in metabolic patterns (ρ= 0.35) and was not related to N2O accumulation.The
latter was correlated with the similarity of nitrite reductase residues. When nir genes were
analyzed separately, the similarity in amino acids coded by the nirS genes was highly corre-
lated with the observed patterns of N2O accumulation (ρ= 0.62), whereas nirK amino acid
residues were unrelated to N2O accumulation. For bacterial assemblages, phylogenetic
diversity (average similarity among species in a community) and mean community dissim-
ilarity (average distance between species) calculated using 16S rRNA gene sequences,
and FD measures associated with metabolic proﬁles, poorly predicted the variation in the
functioning of assembled communities (≤15%). In contrast, the proxies of FD based on
N2O accumulation patterns performed better and explained from 23 to 42% of the vari-
ation in denitriﬁcation. Amongst those, community niche was the best metric, indicating
the importance of complementarity for resources in the context of bacterial community
functioning.

INTRODUCTION
As biodiversity is threatened by global changes, understanding
the relationship between diversity and the functioning of ecosys-
tems or biological communities has received increasing attention
(Hooper et al., 2005). Microbial communities are key drivers of
soil ecosystem processes. Yet, as 10 g of soil might contain 104–
106 distinct taxa (Torsvik and Ovreas, 2002; Gans et al., 2005), a
complete understanding of microbial diversity is still a challenge.
Despite this overwhelming prokaryotic diversity, the potential loss
of diversity at the microbial scale is also of concern. In this context,
it remains unclear to what extent microbial community struc-
ture, especially when based on the 16S rRNA gene as phylogenetic
marker, can be used to explain differences in ecosystem processes
related to carbon and nitrogen cycles (Wertz et al., 2006; Fierer
et al., 2007; Le Roux et al., 2008; Philippot et al., 2010). Over-
all, from a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning point of view, it
remains unclear the extent to which microbial community com-
position can be used to predict its impact on ecosystem processes

and how community composition should be characterized in this
context.

Given the high degree of redundancy observed for microorgan-
isms, changes in microbial community structure might not lead to
changes microbial community function. Functional redundancy
is indeed commonplace and especially for broad functions such
as those associated with carbon metabolism, community com-
position may not inﬂuence community functioning (Wohl et al.,
2004; Wertz et al., 2006). In contrast, it has been recently shown
that differences in microbial community structure led to changes
in mineralization rates (Strickland et al., 2009). Contradictory
results have also been observed for other less broad functions,
such as denitriﬁcation in soils (Cavigelli and Robertson, 2000;
Wertz et al., 2006; Salles et al., 2009). This inconsistency in results
might be due to differences in the methodological approaches and
genes targeted to predict the effect of community structure on
ecosystem functioning. For some processes, the genetic diversity
of the phylogenetic marker is not related to the functional traits

that inﬂuence the functioning of the ecosystem (Jones et al., 2008;
Baelum et al., 2010). In that case, taxa identity might not provide
enough information on whether an organism is able to carry out
a given process, at what rates or under which environmental con-
ditions. For instance, physiological studies have shown that the
enzymatic activities among species from different bacterial classes
might be more comparable than between species belonging to the
same genus (Carlson and Ingraham, 1983) whereas very similar
taxa can strongly differ from a functional point of view (Salles et al.,
2009). Therefore, in order to better predict community function-
ing, it is crucial to understand the relationship between microbial
phylogeny and physiology (Allison and Martiny, 2008).

In the context of bacteria associated with the nitrogen cycle,
the congruence between taxonomic phylogenies, which are mostly
based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, and the phylogenies based
on functional gene sequences is process-dependent. For instance,
ammonium oxidation is carried out by a relatively small number
of prokaryotic taxa and experimental evidence suggests a con-
gruence in the phylogeny of ribosomal (16S rRNA) and amo
genes for both bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers (Prosser
and Nicol, 2008). Among denitriﬁers, the enzyme nitrite reduc-
tase, which mediates the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide, is
present in all denitrifying bacterial species. Furthermore, two func-
tionally redundant but structurally distinct nitrite reductases are
found among denitriﬁers: a copper (Cu-Nir) and a cytochrome
cd1 (Cd-Nir) nitrite reductase, coded by the nirK and nirS genes,
respectively. In contrast to nitriﬁers, denitrifying bacteria are phy-
logenetic diverse and are distributed over 60 genera (Zumft, 1997).
When comparing the phylogeny of the nir genes with the 16S rRNA
gene, it was shown that only the nirS and 16S rRNA gene phylogeny
was congruent, suggesting that nirK might have been mainly
acquired through horizontal gene transfer (Heylen et al., 2006).

The use of either phylogenetic or functional genes has improved
our knowledge about the ecology of microbial functional groups.
For instance, a good congruence seems to exist between the phy-
logeny (at the genus level) and functional traits of bacterial nitrite
oxidizers (Attard et al., 2010). In the case of denitriﬁcation, the use
of functional genes might provide evidence that nirK- and nirS-
harboring bacteria are ecologically distinct. For instance, a study
focusing on a short-term restoration chronosequence indicated
that the abundance of the major nirS populations vary similarly
with time after disturbance, since sites that were restored at the
same time shared higher similarities in nirS communities. Con-
versely, nirK populations were characterized by three independent
response groups, suggesting higher sensitivity to environmental
gradients (Smith and Ogram, 2008). Furthermore, it has been pro-
posed that nirK denitriﬁers respond to a range of environmental
parameters, whereas denitriﬁers harboring nirS are mainly driven
by nitrate availability (Jones and Hallin, 2010). The ecologically
distinct role of nirK and nirS communities has been also observed
in the rhizosphere of grain legumes where nirK and not nirS gene
transcripts could be detected (Sharma et al., 2005), and in crop-
ping systems where changes in denitriﬁcation were related to the
abundance of nirK - rather than nirS-harboring bacteria (Attard
et al., 2011).

Despite our increasing knowledge about the ecological distrib-
ution of these functional groups and the mechanisms underlying

community assembly, an issue that remains open is to what extent
the information based on the genetic diversity of phylogenetic or
functional markers reﬂect the diversity of traits among functional
groups, and furthermore, how both these markers ultimately inﬂu-
ence ecosystem functioning. In this study we used denitriﬁers as
a model group to address these relationships. We focused on den-
itriﬁcation because it is a function performed by taxonomically
diverse species, whose activity is regulated in particular by the
quality and quantity of organic compounds. Moreover, the two key
functional genes coding for nitrite reductase (nirK and nirS) could
provide different results due to their different functionalities and
to the importance of horizontal transfer for nirK. In order to test
the extent to which functional similarity (similarity of functional
traits) is linked to the variation in the sequence of phylogenetic
or functional marker genes, we analyzed a set of 29 denitrifying
strains according to the following attributes. Genetic diversity was
calculated for the phylogenetic (16S rRNA) and functional mark-
ers (nir). Additionally, functional trait diversity was determined
according to the metabolic proﬁles of the strains by measuring
their activity over a range of 95 carbon sources under denitrify-
ing conditions and measuring their N2O accumulation patterns in
presence of six different carbon sources. We then assessed to what
extent the genetic similarities (16S rRNA gene or nir genes) could
be used to infer the similarity in functional traits. In this context,
we hypothesize that the 16S rRNA phylogenetic marker would be
weakly correlated with the similarity in metabolic proﬁles, but not
correlated with the N2O accumulation patterns. Moreover, we pre-
dict that the genetic diversity of the functional markers (nir genes)
would correlate with the N2O accumulation patterns. Under this
hypothesis, we also predicted that this correlation could be weaker
for genes highly submitted to horizontal transfer, such as nirK.

In addition, to examine the link between bacterial diversity and
denitriﬁcation, we calculated a range of diversity proxies widely
used in general ecology (Heemsbergen et al., 2004; Petchey and
Gaston, 2006; Cadotte et al., 2009; Petchey et al., 2009; Mouchet
et al., 2010). We also determined which diversity proxies, based on
taxa richness, phylogenetic (16S rRNA gene) or functional simi-
larities (based either on metabolic proﬁles or N2O accumulation
patterns), were more relevant for predicting the effect of bacterial
diversity on denitriﬁcation. For that, we used recently published
data (Salles et al., 2009) on denitriﬁcation rates for a range of
assembled denitrifying bacterial communities. We hypothesize
that diversity proxies that take into account functional attrib-
utes would be the best predictors of community functioning. The
observed relationships between the functional traits and phylo-
genetic/genetic relatedness and a range of diversity proxies widely
used in microbial ecology are discussed in the context of predicting
the effect of bacterial diversity on community functioning.

(Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany) and cloned into the pGEM T-

UK). Clones were sequenced by LGC genomics using ABI 3730-
XL Sequencer (LGC genomics, Berlin, Germany). The taxonomic
afﬁliation of the strains was assigned by comparing the obtained
sequences against public databases (Blastn, NCBI)1. The similarity
between the 16S rRNA gene sequences was determined by creating

a pairwise distance matrix based on the Jukes and Cantor substi-
tution model (Ribosomal database project, release 10; Jukes and
Cantor, 1969; Cole et al., 2007).

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NITRITE REDUCTASE IDENTITY
Partial sequences of the genes nirK and nirS, coding for the copper
(Cu-Nir) or cytochrome cd1 (Cd-Nir) nitrite reductase respec-
tively, were ampliﬁed from the denitrifying bacterial strains. The
nirK genes were ampliﬁed using the primers Copper 583F and
Copper 909R (Liu et al., 2003), generating a fragment of 358 bp.
A 425-bp fragment from the nirS gene was ampliﬁed by using the
primers cd3aF and R3cd (Throback et al., 2004). Details on ampli-
ﬁcation procedure for nirK and nirS genes are given as Appendix.
Both nirK and nirS fragments were cloned and sequenced as
described above for 16S rRNA gene.

Predicting denitriﬁcation using diversity proxies

The nucleotide sequences were aligned and translated to amino
acid sequences using BioEdit2. Differences among amino acid
residues between pairs of nirK or nirS denitrifying bacterial strains
were measured between pairs of nirK- or nirS-harboring denitri-
fying bacterial strains, using Gonnet matrix (Gonnet et al., 1992)
implemented in the software DNASTAR (Madison, USA).

DETERMINATION OF METABOLIC PROFILES
BIOLOG AN plates (AES Chemunex, Bruz, France) were inoc-
ulated with strains listed on Table 1. Cultures representing the
pre-inoculum were grown under anaerobic conditions on NB
medium containing 20 mM KNO3 for 3 days at 28˚C and 200 rpm.
Cells from pre-inoculum were harvested by centrifugation at 15˚C
for 15 min at 10,000 g, and resuspended in fresh NB medium

containing 20 mM KNO3 to obtain OD560 = 0.1. These fresh cell

suspensions that represented the inocula were grown for 5 h under
the same conditions mentioned above. After this period, cells were
harvested by centrifugation as previously described, washed twice
in PBS and starved for 2 h at room temperature. The inocula
were then centrifuged and resuspended in PBS containing 20 mM

KNO3. Cell density was adjusted to OD560 = 0.2 and 150 μl of

cell suspension was transferred to each well of BIOLOG AN plates
(AES Chemunex, Bruz, France). Plates were placed in anaerobic
incubation bags (Merck, Fontenay-sous-Bois, France). The atmos-
phere inside the bags was replaced by N2 and the bags were sealed
with two anaeroclips (Merck). Anaerotest strip (Merck) was used
as an indicator for the absence of O2 inside the bags. Plates were
incubated at 28˚C for 2 days and subsequently analyzed with a
spectrophotometer (Xenius, SAFAS, Monaco) at 550 nm. The data
were normalized by dividing the absorbance of each well by the
total absorbance of the plate. The whole analysis was performed in
duplicate, meaning that two individual colonies from each strain
were used to inoculate two separate pre-inocula.

A matrix representing the metabolic proﬁles (relative activ-
ity values on each of the 95 carbon sources) of the denitrifying
strains was used to calculate the functional trait similarity among
strains. We used either Euclidean distance model or Bray Cur-
tis similarity (square root transformed data), implemented in the
software PRIMER (version 6, PRIMER-E Ltd., Plymouth, UK).
Two distance measures were used to evaluate to what extend
strain relatedness would be dependent on the distance applied
to calculate functional trait similarity.

QUANTIFYING N2O PRODUCTION IN PRESENCE OF DIFFERENT CARBON
SOURCES
N2O accumulation patterns on individual carbon sources were
measured for a set of 22 bacterial strains (Table 1). Six out of
the 95 carbon sources found in the BIOLOG plates were chosen,
according to their ability to discriminate the selected strains (Salles
et al., 2009) and their common occurrence in bulk or rhizosphere
soil. Bacterial cells were inoculated in microcosms consisting of
150-ml plasma ﬂasks sealed with rubber stoppers and containing
50 ml of minimal medium M9 (Sambrook et al., 1989) supple-
mented with 0.02 M KNO3 and one carbon source (1.6 mg C

−1): d-cellobiose, maltose, l-fucose, l-malic acid, l-glutamine,
L
or fumaric acid. We replaced the atmosphere of the ﬂasks by a
90:10 mixture of He-C2H2 to provide anaerobic conditions for
denitriﬁcation and to inhibit of N2O-reductase activity, allow-
ing us to quantify the amount of N2O produced by the bacterial
strains. Flasks were incubated at 28˚C and 160 rpm. The bacter-
ial inoculum consisted of cells at the exponential growth phase,
growing anaerobically on the same medium containing all six car-
−1). Before
bon sources (each source was present at 0.27 mg C L
inoculation, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with
sterile PBS buffer and let to starvation for 2 h at room temperature
on PBS. Bacteria were inoculated in the microcosms to obtain a

ﬁnal cell density of OD560 = 0.002.

In order to quantify N2O accumulation, the head space of the
ﬂasks was sampled 10 times during a period of 3 days (0, 11, 15,
19, 23, 37, 43, 46, 61, and 66 h after inoculation) and immedi-
ately analyzed by injecting 100 μl of collected gas directly in a
gas chromatograph (P200 MicroGC, Agilent technology, Massy,
France).

This experiment was carried out in duplicate. The N2O pro-
duction by each individual strain was determined as microgram
N-N2O per milliliter 66 h after inoculation, when all the strains
had attained the lag phase. For each culture, the number of cells
was measured by ﬂow cytometry as detailed in the Section“Appen-
dix.” A matrix containing the average N2O accumulation patterns
−1) for each source and each strain was used
(μgN-N2O ml culture
to determine the functional similarity among strains, as previously
indicated for metabolic proﬁles, using Euclidean distance model.
We analyzed both raw data and data normalized by dividing each
value by the sum of values obtained on each of the six carbon
sources for a given strain.

COMPUTATION OF DIVERSITY PROXIES FOR BACTERIAL ASSEMBLAGES
The communities described by Salles et al. (2009) refer to a set
of 16 denitrifying bacterial strains that were assembled in differ-
ent levels of richness (S), varying from 1 to 8. For each richness
level, community composition also varied, ranging from 24 com-
munities with two strains, 12 communities of four strains and 8
communities with eight strains. All 16 strains were also grown in
monocultures, in duplicates.

Phylogenetic diversity (PD) was calculated using similarity dis-
tances based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Brieﬂy, PD was calcu-
lated for each one of the bacterial communities mentioned above,
by taking into account all possible pairwise combinations among
strains in a given community and averaging the computed similar-
ity distances (Jukes and Cantor substitution model). Considering
that PD is dependent on species richness, we also used another
diversity proxy, mean community dissimilarity (Diss) that is less
affected by the number of species in a community. Thus, the 16S
rRNA gene was used to calculate Diss, deﬁned as the average dis-
tance between species (Heemsbergen et al., 2004; Jousset et al.,
2011). Distances were calculated using the Maximum Composite
Likelihood model, implemented in MEGA (version 5.2).

Functional diversity (FD) proxies based on physiological data
were calculated using similarities obtained from metabolic pro-
ﬁles (BIOLOG) or N2O accumulation patterns. Two methods
were applied to infer FD: one based on distance measures and

Predicting denitriﬁcation using diversity proxies

another on dendrograms. For the distance-based method, we used
the measure of Functional Attribute Distance (FAD; Walker et al.,
1999; Mouchet et al., 2010), which represents the mean distance
between species present in a community (Cadotte et al., 2009;
Petchey et al., 2009). The dendrogram-based method relies on the
FD measure (Petchey and Gaston, 2002) and corresponds to the
total branch length from a functional dendrogram, which con-
nects members of a given community together (Cadotte et al.,
2009; Petchey et al., 2009). FAD was determined by using Euclid-
ean distance to calculate the pairwise distance between species.
FD was generated using the functions “dist(),” “hclust(),” and
“Xtree()” implemented in R (version 2.13.0; Petchey and Gaston,
2002).

We also used the measure Community Niche (CN) measure
(Salles et al., 2009), which is based on the performance (N2O accu-
mulation) of individual species when they are growing on single
carbon sources. Brieﬂy, given a community of several strains grow-
ing on a mixture of n C sources, CN aggregates the best perfor-
mances (here highest N2O accumulation) observed on individual
C sources (Salles et al., 2009). Suppose a community composed of
denitrifying species A and B, growing on a mixture of resources 1, 2,
and 3. When growing on individual resources, species A has higher
denitriﬁcation rate than species B for resource 1 (DA1 > DB1). For
the other two resources, species B performs better (DA2 < DB2;
DA3 < DB3) Thus, the CN of this two-species community rep-
resents the sum of the highest performance on each resource
(CNAB = DA1 + DB2 + DB3).

DATA ANALYSIS
Principal components analyses (PCA) and redundancy analysis
(RDA) based on the metabolic proﬁles or N2O accumulation
patterns were performed with CANOCO software (version 4.52,
Wageningen, The Netherlands).

The relationships between functional and (phylo)genetic sim-
ilarities were tested using a non-parametric form of Mantel test
(RELATE), implemented in PRIMER-E software package (version
6). The similarity matrices obtained based on metabolic proﬁles
or N2O production patterns were compared against the matrices
based on genetic information (16S rRNA gene sequence or nitrite
reductase identity) using a rank correlation coefﬁcient (here Spear-
man coefﬁcient) and signiﬁcance level obtained by a permutation
test (5000 permutations).

Standard regressions were used to test for relationships between
community functioning (N2O accumulation) and different diver-
sity proxies. The strength, the form and signiﬁcance of the rela-
tionships were assessed by regression, implemented on the SPSS
software (release 16.0.2).

In order to compare strains in terms of their functional traits,
we used similarity metrics based on Euclidean distance because
they provide the distance between strains in a n-dimensional space

(n = 95 or 6, for metabolic proﬁles and N2O accumulation, respec-

tively). Since the choice of the similarity coefﬁcient is likely to
inﬂuence our results, we also computed the similarities using the
Bray Curtis coefﬁcient. Although the correlation coefﬁcient val-
ues varied according to the similarity measure used, the overall
patterns were the same and our conclusions still hold (data not
shown).

RESULTS
METABOLIC PROFILES
The analyses of the metabolic proﬁles of the 29 denitrifying bac-
terial strains, determined with BIOLOG plates under denitrifying
conditions, showed that strains varied mainly in their ability to uti-
lize aromatic compounds, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino
acids, and alcohols (Figure 1). Redundancy analyses performed
with the same data set indicated that all classes of substrates had a
signiﬁcant effect (P < 0.006) on the metabolic proﬁles, except for
amines (P = 0.054) and polymers (P = 0.066). In order to deter-
mine the relative contribution of each class of substrates, we used
variance partitioning to control for the effect of individual classes
when all other classes are deﬁned as covariables in a constrained
analysis (Leps and Smilauer, 2003). From the amount of variability
explained by the ordination model when all classes are considered
(63.5%), 29% could be assigned to the classes of substrates, as fol-
lows: aromatic compounds, 5.9%; carbohydrates, 5.1%; organic
acids, 4.7%; amino acids, 4.2%; alcohol, 3.6%; amines, 3.1%; poly-
mers, 2.4%, whereas the remaining variation was attributed to the
variance shared between individual substrates.

When considering each phylogenetic class separately (Figure 1),
the γ-proteobacteria were functionally diverse, with represen-
tatives having very different metabolic proﬁles. All but two
pseudomonads were able to utilize organic acid compounds. The
non-pseudomonads strains differed from the other class mem-
ber by their ability to use aromatic compounds, carbohydrates,
and polymers and by their low metabolic activity on organic
acids. The α-proteobacteria clustered closely together, except for
strain G30, which showed the most divergent metabolic proﬁles

together with two strains from the Achromobacter xylosoxidans
(β-proteobacteria class). Species belonging to the genus Ochrobac-
trum showed a wide variety of proﬁles, the only widespread char-
acteristic being their low efﬁciency in using organic acids. The two
representatives of the genus Azospirillum were quite distinct in
their metabolic proﬁles, varying mainly in the use of amino and
organic acids. The two genera belonging to the β-proteobacteria
class differed greatly among each other, mainly regarding the use
of sources belonging to the carboxylic acid class. The three rep-
resentatives of the Bacilli class clustered very close together and
could be identiﬁed by their ability to use aromatic compounds,
carbohydrates, and polymers.

N2O ACCUMULATION PATTERNS
The effect of individual carbon sources on the N2O accumulation
patterns by individual strains was characterized by PCA analysis.
As seen on Figure 2 (top), when using normalized values, closely
related strains tended to exhibit similar patterns with a number of
exceptions. More speciﬁcally, P. aeruginosa strains showed similar
N2O accumulation when growing on glutamine but varied in their
ability to produce N2O using one of the carboxylic acids (malic
acid). Similarly, the two Burkholderia species varied mainly in their
response to malic acid and glutamine. The functioning of P. ﬂu-
orescens and P. stutzeri strains was alike, with N2O accumulation
varying mainly in relation to fucose and cellobiose, except for one

strain of P. ﬂuorescens that used glutamine. Fumaric acid and cel-
lobiose induced the largest variation in the N2O accumulation
observed between the Bacilli species. The metabolic proﬁles of the
three Ochrobactrum strains were different, varying mainly in the
use of glutamine and malic acid. In particular, these strains var-
ied in the absolute values of N2O production (Figure 2, bottom).
The majority of P. aeruginosa strains showed high N2O produc-
tion. The highest N2O accumulation values were observed for one
strain of Ochrobactrum and for Paracoccus denitriﬁcans.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SIMILARITY OF METABOLIC PROFILES
AND SIMILARITY OF PATTERNS OF N2O ACCUMULATION AND
(PHYLO)GENETIC RELATEDNESS
A signiﬁcant correlation was observed between the metabolic pro-
ﬁles and phylogenetic relatedness between strains (Figure 3). The
similarity of 16S rRNA gene sequence computed using the Euclid-
ian distance model explained a signiﬁcant but modest fraction
of the variability observed in the metabolic proﬁles obtained on
BIOLOG (ρ= 0.35; P = 0.002). Interestingly, when focusing on
bacterial classes, higher correlations were observed between the
genetic distance based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences and
the percentage of the variation in metabolic proﬁles (ρ= 0.48,
P = 0.005 and ρ= 0.71, P = 0.003 for γ-proteobacteria and α-
proteobacteria, respectively; Table 2). Considering that the meta-
bolic proﬁles showed an uneven response across strains, we per-
formed the same analysis using a matrix based on Bray Curtis
coefﬁcient instead of Euclidian distance. Although the Spearman
correlation coefﬁcients changed slightly, the conclusions were the
same (all strains: ρ= 0.35, P = 0.001; γ-proteobacteria: ρ= 0.57,
P = 0.004; α-proteobacteria: ρ= 0.69, P = 0.003).

The similarity of N2O accumulation patterns among strains
could not be explained by the similarity of the 16S rRNA gene,
even when considering α-and γ-proteobacterial classes separately
(Figure 4A). Computing the pattern in the N2O accumulation
per cell (i.e., patterns of speciﬁc activity) led to similar results, as
no signiﬁcant relationships were observed (Figure 4B; Table 2).
In contrast, the identity of the nitrite reductase residues was
signiﬁcantly correlated with the patterns of N2O accumulation
among all strains (ρ= 0.45, P = 0.004; Table 2; Figure 5A). When
considering the identity of amino acid residues obtained from
the two genes coding for nitrite reductase (nirK and nirS) sepa-
rately, the similarity in amino acids coded by the nirS genes was
highly correlated with the observed pattern of N2O accumula-
tion (ρ= 0.62, P = 0.003; Table 2), whereas that associated with
nirK gene was unrelated to N2O accumulation pattern (P = 0.735;
Table 2; Figure 5B). The similarity of the patterns of N2O pro-
duction per cell and the identity of the nitrite reductase residues
was just above the signiﬁcance level (P = 0.053; Table 2). However,
when analyzing the nirK and nirS residues separately, no correla-
tion was found between the patterns of N2O production per cell
and the identity of each type of nir residues (PnirK = 0.505 and
PnirS = 0.407; Table 2).

associated with metabolic diversity either lead to non-signiﬁcant
relationships with community functioning (FDBIOLOG, Figure 6D)
or explained a similar percentage of variation in functioning as
measures associated with the phylogenetic marker (FADBIOLOG,
Figure 6E). FD measures associated with N2O production
(FDN2O and FADN2O) both had a better explanatory power
(23–26%) of
the variation in community functioning than
measures based on metabolic diversity or phylogenetic marker
(Figures 6F,G). Amongst all the diversity proxies, the CN index,
which accounts for complementary effects among strains rather
than diversity per se, was the best predictor of community func-
tioning and explained 42% of the variation in N2O production
(Figure 6H).

DISCUSSION
Many studies evaluating the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem
functioning have focused on species richness, despite the fact that
ecosystem functioning is not governed by the phylogenetic content
of its organisms but rather by the functional traits of the individ-
uals present, the distribution and abundance of these individuals,
and their biological activity (Hooper et al., 2002; Naeem and
Wright, 2003; Giller et al., 2004; Salles et al., 2009). In this context,
the choice of relevant functional traits for macro-organisms has
been compared to the search for the holy grail (Lavorel and Gar-
nier, 2002). When considering microorganisms, one could argue
that this search for appropriate functional traits represents a more
feasible task, as the functional genes coding for the well-studied
functions such as denitriﬁcation are mostly known (Philippot and
Hallin, 2005; Philippot et al., 2007). Deﬁning the groups involved

1Similarity between the 16S rRNA gene sequences was determined by creating a pairwise distance matrix based on the Jukes and Cantor substitution model.
2Similarities in amino acid residues were measured between pairs of nirK- or nirS-harboring denitrifying bacterial species, using Gonnet matrix.
3Variation in functional patterns between strains were computed based on Euclidean distance.
The signiﬁcance of the relationship was determined using the Spearman correlation coefﬁcient and 5000 permutations.

in each process sets a good foundation toward the quest for the
functional “micro grail,” even though the sheer microbial diver-
sity might still limit this quest. Indeed such an approach has been
extensively used in microbial ecology, and the diversity within
functional groups has been assessed by quantifying the genetic
diversity of either phylogenetic markers such as 16S rRNA gene
(e.g., Stephen et al., 1996) or functional markers such as key func-
tional genes involved in the process of interest (e.g., Poly et al.,
2008). Despite the usefulness of these approaches, the issues that
remain open are (i) to what extent does the genetic variation
observed for phylogenetic or functional markers correspond to
the variation of functional traits within microbial groups, and (ii)
what effect does this genetic variation, functional or phylogenetic,
and diversity of functional traits have on community and ecosys-
tem functioning. We have addressed these issues for a range of
denitrifying bacteria using two approaches. Firstly, by looking at
the relationship between the similarity of functional traits eval-
uated from metabolic proﬁles that were obtained on BIOLOG
plates or from N2O accumulation patterns on different C sources,
and the similarity of phylogenetic (16S rRNA gene) or functional
(nir gene) markers. Secondly, we computed proxies of phyloge-
netic diversity and FD among denitrifying bacterial assemblages,
which were then used to assess how well they could explain the
functioning (denitriﬁcation) of assembled communities.

PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS
The relationship between ecological and phylogenetic similarities
deﬁnes the phylogenetic signal (Losos, 2008), and this notion was
supported in our metabolic proﬁle data: closely related strains
were able to utilize carbon substrates in a similar fashion, whereas
distantly related strains exhibited a greater variation in their meta-
bolic resemblance. However, the strength of the phylogenetic
signal to explain metabolic proﬁles was low, as the Mantel test

exhibited a ρ= 0.35 when considering the whole set of strains.
In fact, in some cases, unrelated strains shared higher similarities
in their metabolic proﬁles (as shown by smaller Euclidean dis-
tances) than closely related ones. Similar conclusions have been
recently reported for natural soil microbial communities, from
which 39% of the catabolic proﬁles could be explained by the phy-
logenetic content of the communities, when considering two sites
(Fierer et al., 2012). Interestingly, our ﬁndings indicate a higher
consistency in terms of metabolic proﬁles among members of the
α-proteobacteria class, which showed higher phylogenetic signal
in metabolic proﬁles when compared to γ-proteobacteria class.
This is consistent with previous results reporting that there is an
ecological coherence of bacterial groups at deeper branches of
bacterial taxonomy, such as bacterial classes (Fierer et al., 2007;
Philippot et al., 2010). For instance, the comparison between the
metabolic plasticity of soil bacterial communities facing addi-
tion of different C compounds and their phylogeny suggests that
closely related species do not always use resources in a similar man-
ner, although some bacterial families seem to be more consistent
in their carbon metabolism (Goldfarb et al., 2011). Our results
are consistent with the conclusion of Cohan (2006) who stated
that bacterial systematics fails to provide species labels allowing
predictions about the biology of the members of a given bacter-
ial species, given the great diversity in the metabolic capabilities
of closely related strains. Actually, our results indicate that the
use of phylogeny to infer bacterial community composition or
diversity might not be meaningful from an ecosystem function
perspective.

This conclusion is even stronger if phylogenetic traits are used
to infer denitriﬁcation (here, N2O production), a process known
to be weakly related to phylogeny (Philippot and Hallin, 2005, see
section below). Indeed, we observed no phylogenetic signal when
evaluating the patterns of N2O production, even after correcting

FUNCTIONAL MARKERS AND N2O PRODUCTION
In order to evaluate the diversity of denitrifying bacterial strains
in environmental sample, most studies use the genetic diversity of
sequences of key genes involved in the denitriﬁcation step of inter-
est, rather than phylogenetic markers (Patra et al., 2005; Sharma
et al., 2005; Heylen et al., 2006; Smith and Ogram, 2008; Hallin
et al., 2009). In our study, the patterns of N2O accumulations (for
a range of carbon sources) did not show a phylogenetic signal
but were highly correlated with the identity of nitrite reductase
residues. Interestingly, the patterns differed among nitrite reduc-
tase genes. The variation in the identity of the partial NirS protein
was highly correlated with the variation observed for N2O accu-
mulation proﬁles for nirS-harboring bacteria; in contrast, the
variation observed for N2O accumulation proﬁles was not sig-
niﬁcantly correlated with variation in the identity of the NirK
protein for nirK -harboring bacteria. It has been suggested that
the nirS gene is less prone to horizontal gene transfer than nirK

(Heylen et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2008), which could explain the
higher congruency observed between functional gene sequence
similarity and functional trait similarity for nirS-harboring bac-
teria. These ﬁndings have great implications for studies that use
nitrite reductase genes to link community composition and den-
itriﬁcation rates, indicating that although the genetic diversity
associated with both nirK and nirS can be used to study shifts
in the composition of denitrifying communities, the changes in
the genetic structure of nirK-harboring denitriﬁer communities
are not well related to changes in functional traits relevant for
denitriﬁcation.

In our study we have opted for focusing on nir genes, since
those are present in all denitrifying species (Mahne and Tiedje,
1995). One could argue that our analyses were performed on
partial amino acid sequences from both proteins (116 and 143
amino acid residues from NirK and NirS, respectively) and that
the use of the whole protein could partly inﬂuence our results.
Nevertheless, the stretch of DNA coding for nitrite reductase used
here corresponds to those commonly used to study the diver-
sity of denitriﬁers (Heylen et al., 2006; Smith and Ogram, 2008;

involved in the denitriﬁcation processes do not always explain
denitriﬁcation patterns in a similar fashion as nir gene (Kandeler
et al., 2006; Hallin et al., 2009) it would be interesting to deter-
mine how the identity of genes such as nar, nor, or nos, would
predict denitriﬁcation rates. These comparisons might indicate
the most appropriate functional marker to describe the struc-
ture of denitrifying communities. Moreover, our results show that
the regulation mechanisms of targeted functions and the evo-
lutionary history of bacterial taxa have to be accounted for to
steer us towards our quest for the functional grail in microbial
ecology.

CHARACTERIZING DENITRIFIER DIVERSITY FROM A FUNCTIONAL
PERSPECTIVE
The quest to understand and predict the effects of biodiver-
sity on ecosystem functioning has led to the development of
a range of diversity measures. These have been used to quan-
tify the extent to which the different aspects of biodiversity,

(N2O production) and indexes of community diversity. The diversity
measures were based on the number of species in the community
[species richness (A)]; the diversity of 16S rRNA gene sequences
[phylogenetic diversity, PD (B)]; dissimilarity in 16S rRNA gene sequences
[Diss (C)]; the functional diversity based on metabolic proﬁles [FDBIOLOG

[FADBIOLOG (E)]; the functional diversity based on patterns of N2O

patterns of N2O accumulation [FADN2 O, (G)]; and the functional niche
occupied by each community [CN (H)]. (A,H) were drawn from Salles et al.

Predicting denitriﬁcation using diversity proxies

diversity proxies are the most useful to explain community
functioning.

We tackled these issues by calculating indexes based on phylo-
genetic and functional diversity that are often used to predict the
effect of the diversity of higher organisms on ecosystem processes
(Petchey and Gaston, 2002; Petchey, 2004; Cadotte et al., 2009) for
a range of denitrifying bacterial strains. Furthermore, we inferred
how valuable each one of them was for predicting community
functioning (denitriﬁcation), by relating these indexes to the level
of community functioning reported by Salles et al. (2009) for
denitrifying bacterial assemblages.

Despite the fact that diversity metrics based on phylogenetic
distance or the number of species in a given community are often
poorly related to community functioning in general (Hooper et al.,
2005) and microbial (Salles et al., 2009) ecology, they are often used
to assess microbial diversity in environmental samples. When used
to predict the functioning of denitrifying bacterial assemblages,
both the metrics based on phylogenetic marker (PD and Diss)
and on species richness (S) performed poorly. Considering the
issues discussed in the previous section, the results observed for PD
were not surprising, and probably reﬂect the low phylogenetic sig-
nal associated with denitriﬁcation. The weak predictive power of
species richness should be carefully considered, especially in exper-
iments addressing the relationship between microbial diversity
and functioning, in which species richness is often the explana-
tory variable considered (Bärlocher and Corkum, 2003; Setäla and
McLean, 2004; Wohl et al., 2004; Bell et al., 2005; Tiunov and Scheu,
2005; Jiang, 2007).

Contrary to measures based on phylogenetic distance or species
richness, measures associated with functional traits are more
meaningful in the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning context, as
they integrate organismal traits that directly inﬂuence a given
process. We therefore determined functional diversity for two
types of traits, metabolic diversity and N2O production patterns,
each one quantifying a different aspect of denitriﬁer functionality.
For both trait types, we used different metrics based on multivari-
ate strategy, FAD and FD, and compared their ability to predict
denitriﬁcation to the one of CN (Salles et al., 2009). Interestingly,
the diversity measures based on metabolic diversity explained no
or little variation in denitriﬁcation, whereas those based on N2O
production patterns performed better. This suggests that both the
choice of traits and diversity metric(s) are important to properly
infer community functioning. More speciﬁcally, a diversity mea-
sure based on overall carbon metabolism (FADBIOLOG) poorly
predicted denitriﬁcation, whereas applying the same diversity met-
ric but based on N2O production patterns doubled its explanatory
power, highlighting the importance of selecting for the appropriate
traits. Functional diversity metrics also differ in their explanatory

power. For instance, multivariate diversity measures based on N2O
production patterns (FDN2O and FADN2O) explained the deni-
triﬁcation rates equally well, which could be partially explained
by the degree of correlation between them (R = 0.63). How-
ever, their performance remained inferior to CN. This could be
attributed to the fact that CN reﬂects the complementarity effect
among strains (accounting for the performance of each strain on
single carbon sources, it considers the sum of the highest per-
formance on each individual carbon source possible for a given
community) rather than diversity per se, as calculated for FADN2O
and FDN2O. Thus, the superior performance of CN as compared
to the other proxies presented here supports previous evidence
(Hooper et al., 2005) of the importance of complementarity for
resource use among taxa in the context of bacterial community
functioning.

The information retained in the phylogenetic marker might be
ecologically meaningful for studies focusing on microbial com-
munity composition and distribution. However, our results con-
ﬁrm the often cited hypothesis that, for broad functions such
as denitriﬁcation, the diversity of functional gene sequences are
better predictors of functioning than the diversity of sequences
of phylogenetic markers (Philippot and Hallin, 2005). More-
over, our results suggest that characterizing the genetic diversity
of nir gene fragments, as is often done to analyze the rela-
tionship between the diversity and functioning of denitriﬁers,
might be more meaningful for nirS- than nirK-harboring com-
munities. Further studies focusing on the whole denitriﬁcation
machinery and considering full gene sequences are necessary to
conﬁrm our hypothesis. Nevertheless, we provide evidence that
ﬁndings based on the relationship between nirK genetic diver-
sity and denitriﬁcation rates should be considered with caution.
More generally, our results show that when analyzing the link
between the diversity and functioning of microbial communi-
ties, indexes based on the diversity of phylogenetic or functional
marker genes, or on functional trait diversity, might be useful.
But they might remain inferior to indexes that more explic-
itly reﬂect complementarity effects among populations rather
than the diversity per se. Overall, our results spur the use of
diversity indexes based on relevant functional traits and the
development of diversity proxies that integrate complementarity
effect.

Predicting denitriﬁcation using diversity proxies

APPENDIX
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Characterization of taxonomic afﬁliation of strains
In order to amplify the 16S rRNA gene, genomic DNA was iso-
lated from the strains using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN,
Courtaboeuf, France), following the manufacturer instructions.
One microliter of genomic DNA was used as template in a 20-μl-
PCR reaction containing 200 μM dNTP, 0.5 μM of each primer,
0.5 U Phusion hot start high ﬁdelity DNA polymerase (Ozyme, St
Quentin en Yvelines, France) and 1× Phusion GC buffer (1.5 mM
MgCl2). PCR program consisted of 30 s at 98˚C, followed by 30
cycles at 98˚C for 10 s, annealing at 68˚C for 15 s, and elongation
at 72˚C for 45 s. Additionally, a ﬁnal elongation step at 72˚C for
7 min was performed.

Characterization of nitrite reductase identity
The nirK genes were ampliﬁed using the primers Copper 583F and
Copper 909R (Liu et al., 2003), generating a fragment of 358 bp,
in a 20-μl-PCR reaction mix containing 1 μl of genomic DNA
as template, consisting of 200 μM dNTP, 0.5 μM of each primer,
0.5 U Phusion hot start high ﬁdelity DNA polymerase (Ozyme, St
Quentin en Yvelines, France) and 1× Phusion HF buffer (1.5 mM
MgCl2). An initial denaturation step of 30 s at 98˚C was used, fol-
lowed by 30 cycles of 98˚C for 10 s, annealing at 62˚C for 15 s, and
elongation at 72˚C for 15 s. The ﬁnal elongation step was extended
for 7 min at 72˚C.

For nirS gene, ampliﬁcation was carried out in a 50-μl-PCR
reaction mix containing 1 μl of genomic DNA as template, con-
sisting of 200 μM dNTP, 0.5 μM of each primer, 10 ng/μl of T4
gene protein (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, USA), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 U of
Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen, Cergy
Pontoise, France) and 1× buffer. Ampliﬁcation was carried out
with an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94˚C, followed by 35
cycles of 94˚C for 30 s, annealing at 57˚C for 60 s, and elongation
at 72˚C for 60 s. The ﬁnal elongation step was extended for 10 min
at 72˚C.

Determining the cell density for denitrifying bacterial strains
In order to count the number of cells, 100 μl of the cultures were
harvested immediately after collecting gas samples (see Materi-
als and Methods). Cells were ﬁxed by mixing with equal volume
of 98% ethanol, and stored at −20˚C. For counting, 15–30 μl of
cells were mixed with PBS buffer containing 0.1% BSA to obtain a
ﬁnal volume of 300 μl. The cell suspension was sonicated for 10 s
to limit cell aggregates and 6 μl of ﬂuorescent beads (AlignFlow,
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Illkirch, France) were added. The cell suspen-
sions were then counted using a ﬂow cytometer (BD FACSCalibur,
Becton–Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Two measurements were
performed for each cell suspension. As mentioned in Materials
and Methods, this experiment was carried out in duplicate. Cell
counts were performed for 18 strains, up to 46 h after inoculation,
when all the strains were in exponential phase.
