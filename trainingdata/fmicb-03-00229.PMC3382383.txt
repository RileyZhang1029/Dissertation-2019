The use of high-throughput transcript proﬁling techniques has opened the possibility of
identifying, in a single experiment, multiple host mRNAs whose levels of accumulation are
altered in response to virus infection. Several studies have used this approach to analyze
the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to the infection by different RNA and DNA viruses.
However, the possible differences in response of genetically heterogeneous ecotypes of
the plant to the same virus have never been addressed before. Here we have used a
strain of Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) experimentally adapted to A. thaliana ecotype Ler -0
and a set of seven plant ecotypes to tackle this question. Each ecotype was inoculated
with the same amount of the virus and the outcome of infection characterized phenotypi-
cally (i.e., virus infectivity, accumulation, and symptoms development). Using commercial
microarrays containing probes for more than 43,000 A. thaliana transcripts, we explored
the effect of viral infection on the plant transcriptome. In general, we found that ecotypes
differ in the way they perceive and respond to the virus. Some ecotypes developed strong
symptoms and accumulated large amounts of viral genomes, while others only developed
mild symptoms and accumulated less virus. At the transcriptomic level, ecotypes could be
classiﬁed into two groups according to the particular genes whose expression was altered
upon infection. Moreover, a functional enrichment analyses showed that the two groups
differed in the nature of the altered biological processes. For the group constituted by
ecotypes developing milder symptoms and allowing for lower virus accumulation, genes
involved in abiotic stresses and in the construction of new tissues tend to be up-regulated.
For those ecotypes in which infection was more severe and productive, defense genes
tend to be up-regulated, deviating the necessary resources from building new tissues.

INTRODUCTION
Plant viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that typically alter
host physiology, diverting metabolites from their normal uses and
directing them toward the production of virus-speciﬁc compo-
nents. To do so, viral constituents (both nucleic acids and encoded
proteins) must establish multiple and complex interactions among
them and with a myriad of host factors (Whitham and Wang,
2004; Bailer and Haas, 2009). As a response to viral infection, cells
may compensate by over- or down-regulating certain metabolic
pathways, including speciﬁc and general antiviral responses [e.g.,
cytokines, systemic-acquired resistance (SAR), or the RNA silenc-
ing pathway]. In the case of plant viruses, in the absence of a
hypersensitive response (i.e., apoptotic cell death), those cells that
have supported viral replication do not die but accumulate large
amounts of viral particles while the infection spreads out through
the plasmodesmata to neighboring cells until reaching the vascular
system and colonizing distant susceptible tissues. The outcome of
all these interactions may either be the plant controlling the spread
of viral infection or the virus overcoming the defenses and estab-
lishing a productive infection that may or may not be associated
with the development of symptoms (Whitham et al., 2006; Dodds

and Rathjen, 2010). Actually, this outcome varies widely even for a
given pair plant-virus species and depends on the particular plant
and virus genotypes, and of course, on environmental variables.

Historically, much effort has gone into identifying individual
cellular traits whose patterns of expression change as a direct or
indirect consequence of viral infection (Carrington and Whitham,
1998; Maule et al., 2002). With the advent of microarray technolo-
gies for high-throughput gene expression proﬁling, it is feasible to
comprehensively examine gene expression networks during plant
defense response triggered by infection with viral pathogens (Row-
land and Jones, 2001; Whitham et al., 2003, 2006; Wise et al.,
2007). Although some studies have analyzed changes in global
mRNA proﬁling resulting from virus infection of natural hosts,
Arabidopsis thaliana has been the main model host used in com-
bination with viruses from different taxonomic families (reviewed
by Elena et al., 2011), regardless of whether this plant was a nat-
ural host for them. Direct comparisons across experiments are
not straightforward because differences in proﬁling techniques
and platforms, plant ecotypes, sampling schemes, inoculation
conditions, and dosages, growth environmental variables, and sta-
tistical normalization methods may all exert unpredictable effects

Arabidopsis ecotypes differ in response to TEV

on the expression pattern of multiple genes. Nonetheless, some
genes are pervasively altered upon infection with different viruses,
including transcription factors, heat-shock proteins, and antiox-
idants, defense-regulated genes, phytohormone biosynthesis, and
signaling, a variety of kinases and phosphatases, many different
metabolic enzymes, proteases and other genes involved in protein
turnover, and genes relevant for chloroplast functions (Whitham
et al., 2003, 2006; Elena et al., 2011). Another remarkable coinci-
dence among viruses is that, in general, genes whose expression
is altered after viral infection tend to be highly connected and
central in the transcriptional regulatory and protein–protein inter-
action networks of the plant (Elena et al., 2011; Rodrigo et al.,
2012), suggesting viruses may preferentially manipulate central
hub genes.

Gan et al. (2011) found extensive genomic, proteomic, and
transcriptomic differences among A. thaliana ecotypes. Not sur-
prisingly, at the level of gene expression, ecotypes differed in their
response to biotic and abiotic factors, including defenses against
pathogens and herbivores. The genetic determinants of A. thaliana
susceptibility to viral infection have been thoroughly studied, even
before the omics era (Carr and Whitham, 2007). One of such resis-
tance systems is the Restricted TEV Movement (RTM ) multigenic
complex composed of the RTM1 (At1g05760), RTM2(At5g04890),
and RTM3(At3g58350) loci (Mahajan et al., 1998; Whitham et al.,
1999, 2000; Chisholm et al., 2000, 2001). The presence of domi-
nant alleles in all three loci is necessary for blocking TEV systemic
movement, while homozygous recessive mutations at any of the
three loci result in systemic infection (Chisholm et al., 2000, 2001).
RTM1 encodes a jacalin-like lectin protein with sequence sim-
ilarities to several myrosinase-binding proteins involved in the
defense response (Chisholm et al., 2000). RTM2 encodes a pro-
tein whose N-terminal region is similar to plant small heat-shock
proteins, whereas the C-terminal region has a transmembrane
domain (Whitham et al., 2000). Finally, RTM3 encodes a pro-
tein with a meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) domain in
its N-terminal region and a coiled-coil domain at its C-terminal
end (Cosson et al., 2010a). RTM1 and RTM3 proteins form a
multimeric complex (Cosson et al., 2010b). The mechanisms by
which these proteins restrict TEV long-distance movement are yet
unclear, although they may cooperate in preventing TEV entry
into, transport through or exit from the phloem. A. thaliana eco-
types vary in their susceptibility to TEV infection (Mahajan et al.,
1998). While some ecotypes allow long-distance movement of the
virus from inoculated rosette leaves to non-inoculated inﬂores-
cence tissues, many ecotypes support replication in inoculated
leaves but do not allow systemic movement (Mahajan et al., 1998).
This susceptibility of certain ecotypes was due to mutations at any
of the three RTM loci (Whitham et al., 1999).

To test the hypothesis that virus adaptation to a new host
is concomitant to changes in the host’s gene expression proﬁle,
Agudelo-Romero et al. (2008b) performed an evolution experi-
ment in which TEV was adapted to the susceptible ecotype Ler-0
(rtm1/rtm1 RTM2/RTM2 RTM3/RTM3). The ancestral TEV was
able of systemically infect Ler-0 plants, although the infection pro-
gressed asymptomatically. After 17 serial undiluted passages, the
resulting virus (denoted as TEV-At 17) had ﬁxed six point muta-
tions, improved its accumulation by three logs and induced visible

and more severe symptoms, including stunting, etching, and leaf
malformation. The set of up- and down-regulated genes upon
infection with TEV-At 17 was almost three times larger than those
altered by the ancestral TEV (Agudelo-Romero et al., 2008a). An
analysis of the enriched biological processes whose expression was
altered revealed that almost all processes down-regulated by TEV
were also down-regulated by TEV-At 17, which in addition sup-
pressed additional developmental and metabolic processes. Func-
tions up-regulated by both viruses were related to plant responses
to different abiotic and biotic stresses, although genes related to
innate immune responses and response to infection were less com-
mon for TEV-At 17 than for the ancestral virus. This observation
led Agudelo-Romero et al. (2008b) to hypothesize that the virus
increased its ﬁtness by acquiring the ability to block the activa-
tion of plant defenses. Both viruses also differentially affected the
expression of master transcription factors and highly connected
proteins, although the evolved virus regulates more central and
highly connected elements (Rodrigo et al., 2012). These results
supported the hypothesis that by adapting to a new host, viruses
should change and improve the way they interact with the com-
ponents of the host cell regulatory network. More recently, Lalic
et al. (2010) have shown that TEV-At 17 was also able of system-
ically colonize some ecotypes that were resistant to the ancestral
TEV virus (i.e., had wild-type alleles at the three RTM loci). Fur-
thermore, the infectivity, accumulation, and severity of symptoms
also varied among ecotypes (Lalic et al., 2010). These three traits
were correlated: those ecotypes in which accumulation was larger
were also more susceptible and showed stronger symptoms (Lalic
et al., 2010).

Following up on Lalic et al. (2010) work, here we sought
to determine whether the observed differences among ecotypes
in susceptibility to TEV-At 17, virus accumulation, and severity
of symptoms might also ﬁnd a parallelism at the level of tran-
scriptomic proﬁle. In other words, we want to explore whether
more productive and more severe infections also show stronger
alterations in the transcriptomic proﬁle than milder and less
productive infections. For this, we have infected A. thaliana eco-
types Col-0, Di-2, Ei-2 (rtm1/rtm1), Ler-0 (rtm1/rtm1), Oy-0, St-0
(rtm3/rtm3), and Wt-1 with isolate TEV-At 17b. Twenty-one days
post-inoculation (dpi), we compared the transcriptome of infected
and mock-inoculated plants from the same ecotype using Agi-
lent microarrays. We found that some gene categories involved in
response to TEV-At 17b infection were ecotype-speciﬁc, whereas
others were shared by different ecotypes. We could classify the six
ecotypes into two groups according to the lists of altered genes
in common. These common factors could be responsible for the
differential efﬁciency of TEV in infecting and propagating in each
ecotype. The two groups of ecotypes also differed in the nature of
the up- and down-regulated biological processes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STARTING VIRAL POPULATION
A. thaliana ecotype Ler-0 frozen infected material from pas-
sage 16 of the experimental evolution protocol (Agudelo-Romero
et al., 2008b) was used to prepare a sap. Fifty 21-days-old plants
of A. thaliana Ler-0were rub-inoculated (two leaves per plant)
with 4 µL of sap containing 10% Carborundum. Plants were

maintained in a BSL-2 greenhouse at 16:8 h light:dark and 24:20˚C
day:night temperature until sample collection on 21 dpi. Plants
showing symptoms were collected, inoculated leaves were removed
and the rest was ground into ﬁne powder, split into aliquots
and stored at −80˚C. The infection was conﬁrmed by RT-PCR
as described in Lalic et al. (2010). The consensus sequence for
the whole genome of the viral population was obtained as pre-
viously described (Agudelo-Romero et al., 2008b). The sequences
were analyzed with DNASTAR software. The resulting genomic
sequence was identical to the one previously described for TEV-
At 17 (Agudelo-Romero et al., 2008b) with the only difference
of an additional non-synonymous mutation G6816A (M2224I)
in the NIa-Pro cistron. Therefore, we named this new isolate as
TEV-At 17b.

INOCULATION OF A. THALIANA ECOTYPES
In order to inoculate each of the seven A. thaliana ecotypes (Col-
0, Di-2, Ei-2, Ler-0, Oy-0, St-0, andWt-1), 2.5 g of the previously
obtained viral stock was suspended in 5 mL of buffer C (50 mM
borate acid, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA). This sap, mixed with 10% Car-
borundum, was used to rub-inoculate two leaves (4 µL per leaf)
from each of the 50 plants for the seven ecotypes. Plants were main-
tained in the conditions described above and harvested 21 dpi,
ground in mortar with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80˚C. Suc-
cessful infections were conﬁrmed by RT-PCR (Lalic et al., 2010).
Plants were inoculated at growth stages between 3.5 and 3.7 in the
Boyes et al. (2001) scale.

RNA PURIFICATION AND VIRAL LOAD QUANTIFICATION
RNA extraction from 100 mg tissue per plant was performed using
RN easy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The concentration of total plant RNA extracts was adjusted
to 50 ng/µL for each sample and the quantiﬁcation of viral load
was done with real time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), using primers and
methods previously described (Lalic et al., 2010) with some minor
modiﬁcations. Ampliﬁcations were done using the ABI PRISM
Sequence Analyzer 7500 (Applied Biosystems), according to the
following proﬁle: 5 min at 42˚C, 10 s at 95˚C following 40 cycles of
5 s at 95˚C and 34 s at 60˚C. RT-qPCR reactions were performed
in triplicate, for each sample. Quantiﬁcation results were further
examined using SDS7500 software v.1.2.3 (Applied Biosystems).

RNA EXTRACTION, RNA LABELING AND MICROARRAY HYBRIDIZATION
At least three biological replicates for each infected sample category
and four technical replicates of mock-inoculated plant were used
for this study. Total RNA was extracted from homogenized tissue
of control and infected plants using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit
(Qiagen) and following manufacturer’s protocol. RNA integrity
was veriﬁed in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technolo-
gies). RNA samples for Bioanalyzer were prepared using RNA 6000
Nano Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies) following manufacturer’s
instructions.

Five hundred nanogram of spectrophotometrically quanti-
ﬁed RNA (Nanodrop ND1000, Thermo scientiﬁc) were used in
ampliﬁcation and labeling reaction with the Quick Amp Labeling
Kit One-Color (Agilent Technologies) following manufacturer’s
instructions. All samples were ampliﬁed and labeled with Cy3

and subsequently veriﬁed in a 2100 Bioanalyzer as previously
described.

As positive control of amplifying, labeling, and hybridization,
synthetic RNA Spikes were added to the samples. The Spike solu-
tion was diluted and prepared following manufacturer’s protocol
(RNA Spike-In Kit, One-Color, Agilent Technologies). Labeled
RNA was used to hybridize the microarray 4× 44 K slides carrying
A. thaliana Col-0 probes (Agilent Technologies) as described at the
standard hybridization protocol from Gene Expression Hybridiza-
tion Kit (Agilent Technologies). After hybridization and wash,
slides were scanned at 532 nm with a GenePix 4000B scanner
(Axon Molecular Devices), at 10 µm resolution and 100% laser
power. Photomultiplier tube voltages were adjusted to equal the
overall signal intensity for each channel, to increase signal-to-noise
ratio, and to reduce the number of spots with saturated pixels. Spot
intensities were quantiﬁed using GenePix Pro 4.1 software (Axon
Molecular Devices).

Microarray data were deposited at NCBI GEO under accession

GSE37269.

MICROARRAY DATA ANALYSIS
Microarray data were simultaneously normalized with software
BABELOMICS 4.21 as follows. Measurements from all microar-
rays were rescaled into a unique ﬁnal distribution to get data from
different samples calibrated one to each other. The expression lev-
els of all probes matching each gene were averaged, reﬂecting the
expression of the gene. Control spots designed for quality check-
ing, background signal, and cross hybridization estimations were
eventually removed from the normalized data. For each ecotype of
A. thaliana, differential expression analyses with the normalized
data were performed using the LIMMA utility in BABELOMICS.
Then, gene ontology (GO) analyses were performed using the
FatiGO utility of BABELOMICS. The list of signiﬁcantly up- or
down-regulated genes was compared with the whole genome list.
To analyze the overlap in the lists of genes with altered expres-
sion among ecotypes, we calculated similarity matrixes between
lists of genes for all pairwise comparisons of ecotypes. The (i, j) ele-
ment of this matrix was computed according to Sij = 2nij/(ni + nj),
where ni and nj are the genes found in ecotypes i and j and nij
the number of genes shared between these two ecotypes. This
similarity matrix was then used to construct a neighbor-joining
dendrogram using PHYLIP v3.692. These analyses were performed
separately for up- and down-regulated genes.

All other statistical analyses were done using IBM SPSS

version 19.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
VIRAL LOAD AND INFECTIVITY OF TEV-At 17b ACROSS ECOTYPES
Strain TEV-At 17b was used to inoculate 50 plants of seven dif-
ferent ecotypes of A. thaliana. The ecotypes were selected accord-
ing to their differences in susceptibility to TEV-At 17 infection
as described in Lalic et al. (2010). TEV-At 17b induced visible
symptoms in the ecotype in which it was evolved, Ler-0, includ-
ing stunting, etching, and leaf malformation (Agudelo-Romero

Hillung et al.

Arabidopsis ecotypes differ in response to TEV

et al., 2008b; Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). The symp-
toms induced by TEV-At 17b strongly differed among ecotypes,
ranging from mild (Col-0, Di-2, and Oy-0) and moderate (Ler-0
and St-0) to a very severe syndrome (Ei-2 or Wt-1; Lalic et al.,
2010; Figure S1 in Supplementary Material).

Next, we sought to evaluate the infectivity of TEV-At 17b on
each ecotype. To do so, we inoculated 54 plants of each ecotype
with equal amounts of viral genomes (previously estimated by
RT-qPCR). Twenty-one dots per inch, infections were conﬁrmed
by visual inspection of symptoms. In those plants showing no
symptoms at all or very mild symptoms, the infection status was
conﬁrmed by RT-PCR. Infectivity was then estimated as the frac-
tion of infected plants using the Laplace’s point estimator for
the Binomial frequency parameter. For small sample sizes, this
method provides more robust estimates than the most commonly
used maximum likelihood estimator (Chew, 1971). Binomial 95%
conﬁdence intervals were also computed. Figure 1A shows the
infectivity data. In all ecotypes, TEV-At 17b infectivity was signiﬁ-
cantly greater than zero, being the lowest in Col-0 and the highest
in Ei-2 and Wt-1. Indeed, infectivity signiﬁcantly varied among
ecotypes (χ2 = 226.815, 6 d.f., P < 0.001) and a Tukey post hoc
test found that ecotypes could be classiﬁed into two disjoint groups
(P≥ 0.058). The ﬁrst group formed by Col-0 and Oy-0, with infec-
tivities ≤35.71%, and all other ﬁve ecotypes classiﬁed as a single
group with infectivities ≥96.43%.

Figure 1B illustrates the variation in viral load among eco-
types 21 dpi. Even after being log transformed, data violated
the assumption of homoscedasticity (Levene’s test, F 6,51 = 6.456,
P < 0.001) and thus Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric ANOVA was
used to evaluate the differences among groups. This test found
a highly signiﬁcant difference (χ2 = 44.113, 6 d.f., P < 0.001)
driven by the existence of two non-overlapping groups (Tukey
test, P≥ 0.171). The ﬁrst group was formed by Col-0 and
Oy-0, ecotypes in which TEV-At 17b reached the lowest accu-
mulation (average viral load= 7.261× 105 genomes/100 ng total
RNA). The second group was constituted by the ﬁve ecotypes
wherein the virus reached higher accumulations (average viral
load= 4.742× 107 genomes/100 ng total RNA; 65-fold compared
to the ﬁrst group).

All these results reproduce those previously reported by Lalic
et al. (2010). Therefore, we refer the interested readers to that paper
for an in depth discussion of these data. Here, we would only like to
emphasize that ecotypes can be classiﬁed into two groups accord-
ing to the susceptibility to and the accumulation of TEV-At 17b:
Col-0 and Oy-0 are less susceptible and allow for lower accumu-
lation levels whereas the other ﬁve ecotypes are highly susceptible
to infection and the virus accumulates to very high levels. An
unfortunate consequence of the low infectivity and accumulation
of TEV-At 17b in Col-0 was our failure to collect useful infected
plant material from this ecotype for its transcriptomic characteri-
zation. Therefore, in the following sections, only the remaining six
ecotypes were used.

SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES INPATTERNS OF GENE EXPRESSION
AMONG INFECTED ECOTYPES
In the previous section we described differences in virus ﬁtness
traits across A. thaliana ecotypes. Next we explored whether these

symptoms and conﬁrmed by RT-PCR in plants showing no or mild
symptoms. (B) Log viral load of TEV-At17b on each ecotype expressed as

differences in TEV-At 17b infectivity and accumulation had a
correlate at the transcriptomic level. A. thaliana Col-0 4× 44 K
one-color microarray slides (Agilent Technologies) representing
almost all plant genes were used in this study. Five biological repli-
cates, infected with TEV-At 17b, for ecotypes Di-2, Ei-2, Ler-0,
St-0, and Wt-1, and three for Oy-0 were analyzed. As negative
controls, we used four replicates of mock-inoculated plants from
each ecotype.

Arabidopsis ecotypes differ in response to TEV

After normalization and statistical analysis of microarray data,
we identiﬁed genes with altered expression in TEV-At 17b-infected
plants compared to mock-inoculated plants. Table 1 shows the
number of genes with signiﬁcant up- and down-regulation. The
complete list of altered genes can be found in Table S1 in Supple-
mentary Material. All ecotypes, except Oy-0, had a large number of
differentially expressed genes in response to TEV-At 17b infection,
ranging from 4041 for Ei-2 to 7184 for Wt-1. By contrast, only
40 genes had signiﬁcantly altered expression for Oy-0. Indeed, a
signiﬁcant correlation exist between the number of altered genes
and viral load (Spearman’s r S = 0.943, 4 d.f., P = 0.005), sup-
porting the hypothesis that the more intense viral replication
(and thus accumulation), the more perturbation to the cellular
metabolism and thus, the more genes are suffering alterations
in their expression levels. It is worth noting that the correlation
remains signiﬁcant even after removing Oy-0 data (rS = 0.900, 3
d.f., P = 0.037), thus precluding the possibility that the observed
correlation was entirely driven by the large difference existing
between accumulation in Oy-0 and the rest of ecotypes.

Readers interested in the detailed lists of differentially expressed
genes for each ecotype are referred to Table S1 in Supplemen-
tary Material. A thoughtful analysis of the effect of infection
of TEV-At 17 on Ler-0 can be found in Agudelo-Romero et al.

(2008a), and for the purpose of comparison, an analysis of the
effect of the ancestral TEV strain on the same ecotype can be found
in Agudelo-Romero et al. (2008b). Here we are mainly interested
in comparing the effect of TEV-At 17b infection across ecotypes.
To do so, we compared the lists of altered genes, separately for up-
and down-regulated genes, in a pairwise manner and computed a
similarity index among pairs of lists. The lists of shared genes can
be consulted in Table S1 in Supplementary Material. The result-
ing similarity matrixes were used to construct neighbor-joining
dendrograms that classify ecotypes according to the similarity of
their responses to TEV-At 17b infection. Figure 2 shows these two
dendrograms, with nearly identical topologies. The dendrograms
support the existence of two clearly separated responses to TEV-
At 17b. The ﬁrst group is formed by ecotypes Di-2, Ler-0, and
St-0. Interestingly, Ler-0 and St-0 were susceptible to the ancestral
strain of TEV because their susceptible alleles at the RTM loci.
Hereafter, we will refer to these ecotypes as Group 1. Similarly, we
will refer to ecotypes Ei-2, Oy-0 and Wt-1 as Group 2. Ecotypes do
not cluster according to their symptoms, viral load, or infectivity.
Group 2 is formed by ecotypes that show all possible sympto-
matologies, while members of Group 1 show either moderate or
severe symptoms. In terms of viral load, Group 1 members all show
high viral accumulation (Figure 1B), whereas Group 2 members
were more variable: Ei-2 and Oy-0 had intermediate accumula-
tion values (Figure 1B) while Wt-1 had the highest accumulation
observed (Figure 1B).

Group 1 have in common 688 up- and 521 down-regulated
genes. Group 2 shares very few genes, because the very short list
of genes altered in Oy-0 (Table 1). However, Ei-2 and Wt-1 within
Group 2 still share 652 up- and 676 down-regulated genes. Glob-
ally, the six ecotypes only share ﬁve up- (At1g21520, At3g50090,
At5g03350, At5g40990, and At5g61890) and one down-regulated
(At5g15240) genes. Again, the low number of altered genes in Oy-
0 biases this result. At1g21520 encodes for a protein of unknown
function that localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and has been

ribonuclease H-like and RNase T/DNA polymerase III and that
has been described in association to the degradation of miRNAs
(Ramachandran and Chen, 2008). At5g03350 encodes for a lectin

for the GDSL lipase-like 1 protein (GLIP1) directly involved in
plant resistance to fungal infection by acting on fungal cell walls.
GLIP1 is a critical component of both local and systemic resistance
responses via the ethylene-dependent pathway (Kwon et al., 2009).
GeneAt5g61890 encodes for a member of the ethylene response
factor subfamily B-4 of the ERF/AP2 transcription factor family.
It is involved in biotic defense responses (Huibers et al., 2009).
Finally, down-regulated gene At5g15240 encodes for a transmem-
brane amino acid transporter and it may be involved in osmotic
stress (Gong et al., 2001).

From this section, we can conclude that heterogeneity exists in
the response of different A. thaliana ecotypes to the infection with
TEV-At 17b. However, ecotypes can be classiﬁed in two groups
according to the similarities among their responses. A core set of
six genes was altered in all ecotypes. Interestingly, four of these
genes were involved in responses to stress and one in the metabo-
lism of miRNAs. Two of the stress-related genes were involved in
the ethylene-dependent systemic resistance, which may indicate
the relevance of this pathway in the response to viral infections.

One may argue that by looking only at 21 dpi, we had missed
the switch-on of speciﬁc defense-related genes and pathways and
that we have just observed a more general response to the intra-
cellular damage induced by TEV on each ecotype. Indeed, it has
been shown that early responses of A. thaliana to several viruses
include changes in the expression of genes related to defense, cellu-
lar signaling, primary, and secondary metabolism, transcription,
and transporters were up-regulated as soon as few hours post-
inoculation (Whitham et al., 2003; Ishihara et al., 2004; Babu
et al., 2008). Furthermore, one may also argue that different cells
and tissues may respond in slightly different ways to infection
(e.g., Yang et al., 2007) and that by pooling tissues together we
missed tissue-speciﬁc responses and take an average picture of a
more complex situation. These two criticisms are, indeed, impor-
tant weaknesses of our study, as for many other mRNA proﬁling
studies of plant-virus interactions (e.g., Golem and Culver, 2003;
Espinoza et al., 2007; Agudelo-Romero et al., 2008a,b; Ascencio-
Ibáñez et al., 2008). We had chosen 21 dpi as our sampling time
for three reasons: (i) symptoms at this late time point result from
the accumulative effects of alterations that take place at differ-
ent moments, (ii) in our previous experience (Agudelo-Romero
et al., 2008b), signiﬁcant differences between TEV strains can be
detected at this time point, and (iii) because this late time point
includes the effect of systemic movement and not just cell-to-cell
movement.

FUNCTIONAL ANOTATION OF ALTERED GENES
Next, we sought to explore which biological processes were affected
by TEV-At 17b infection on each ecotype. To this end GO enrich-
ment analyses were performed. Rather than describing individual
ecotypes, as in the previous section, we will focus in exploring the

commonalities and differences between ecotypic Groups 1 and 2.
To increase the sensitivity of the FatiGO analyses to identify signif-
icant enrichments in biological processes, we removed Oy-0 from
Group 2.

Figure 3 shows the biological processes signiﬁcantly enriched
for up- and down-regulated genes. Focusing ﬁrst in the biolog-
ical processes enriched for the up-regulated genes (Figure 3A),
we found that both groups of ecotypes shared 11 functional cat-
egories, including ﬁve related to oxidative stresses and six related
to defense responses to infections. Not surprisingly, a signiﬁ-
cant enrichment in genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) medi-
ated responses has been detected in all ecotypes. The differences
between the two ecotypic groups are perhaps more interesting than
the similarities. Six biological processes were signiﬁcantly enriched
in Group 1 but not in Group 2. By contrast, 18 categories had
been found as signiﬁcantly enriched in Group 2 but not in Group
1 (Figure 3A). In Group 1, cell wall catabolic processes, auxin
metabolic processes, response to ethylene, and responses to xeno-
biotic stimulus were all enriched. In Group 2, defense processes
were relatively more important: SA mediated signaling was further
enriched, as well as the SAR pathway, innate immune responses,
and activation of apoptosis genes. Some additional responses to
abiotic stresses were also activated in Group 2. The activation of
additional defense responses in Group 2 ecotypes correlates to the
stronger symptoms induced by TEV-At 17b in these ecotypes and
to its larger accumulation.

Regarding the biological processes enriched among down-
regulated genes (Figure 3B), we found a reduced number of
categories signiﬁcantly enriched in both ecotypic groups: peptide
transport, lipid metabolism, cellular glucan metabolism, response
to osmotic stress, and response to hormone stimulus. Twenty-six
categories were signiﬁcantly enriched for genes down-regulated
in Group 1. These categories include shadow avoidance and
responses to red light intensity, regulation of nitrogen utiliza-
tion, lignin catabolism, and cell wall organization, several sec-
ondary metabolism processes (e.g., phenylpropanoid, aromatic
compounds, malate, and fatty acids), and several signaling path-
ways mediated by jasmonic acid, auxins, and ethylene. Similarly, 10
biological processes were enriched among down-regulated genes
in Group 2. This included hyperosmotic salinity and water depra-
vation responses, processes involved in polysaccharide (e.g., cellu-
lose, glucan) biosynthesis, in the metabolism of carboxylic acids,
and responses to abscisic acid stimulus.

A major conclusion can be drawn from these analyses: the two
groups of A. thaliana ecotypes signiﬁcantly differ in the way they
perceive and respond to TEV-At 17b infection. Members of Group
1 tend to up-regulate genes involved in abiotic stresses and cell wall
construction (perhaps reﬂecting the mild effect of viral infection
in plant growth) and to shut down genes involved in secondary
metabolism and some hormone-regulated pathways. Members of
Group 2 tend to up-regulate defense genes and to shut down
the production of cell wall components (perhaps reﬂecting the
strong symptoms developed and the large accumulation of viral
genomes).

Hosts have developed a variety of mechanisms to compensate
for the impact of virus infection. For instance, modiﬁcation of
life-history traits and resource allocation may allow them to be

more tolerant to infection (Stearns, 1976; Michella, 1985; Per-
rin and Christe, 1996). However, experimental support for this
theory in the case of plant viruses is still scarce. In a pioneering
study, Pagán et al. (2008) inoculated 18 ecotypes of A. thaliana at
two different developmental stages with two isolates of Cucumber
mosaic cucumovirus of different virulence and found heterogeneity
among ecotypes in their response to infection. While all acces-
sions delayed ﬂowering, only those belonging to the more tolerant
allometric group modiﬁed resource allocation to increase the pro-
duction of reproductive structures and progeny, and reduced the
length of reproductive period. Similarly, Bedhomme and Elena
(2011) described that one of the effects of TEV and Turnip mosaic
potyvirus infection on Nicotiana benthamiana was to change the
allocation of resources, eliminating the plant-speciﬁc phenotypi-
cally plastic response to intra speciﬁc competition known as shade
avoidance. The results that we report here show that the toler-
ance to the infection of ecotypes belonging to Group 1 compared
to those belonging to Group 2 are clearly associated to profound
differences in the expression of multiple genes.

CONCLUSION
The adaptation of TEV to a particular ecotype of A. thaliana took
place by few mutations in the viral genome. However, these very
few changes had a major impact in the way the virus interacted
with its new host. Interestingly, the adaptation to a particular
ecotype was not speciﬁc but allowed the new virus to infect addi-
tional ecotypes that were not susceptible to the ancestral virus. The
interaction of this emerging virus with the different ecotypes was
heterogeneous and resulted in differences in susceptibility, viral
accumulation, and severity of symptoms. Here we have shown
that this heterogeneity has its reﬂection at the host transcriptomic
level, with different ecotypes activating/suppressing the expres-
sion of different sets of genes. However, we have been able of
classifying ecotypes according to their patterns of gene expression
into two groups. For those ecotypes where infection was more
severe and allowed for more viral accumulation, the set of genes

up-regulated tend to be involved into defenses, deviating resources
from building new tissues. By contrast, more tolerant ecotypes in
which infection induced milder symptoms and the virus accumu-
lated to a lesser extent tend to up-regulate genes involved in abiotic
stresses while expressing genes involved in the construction of new
tissues. The analysis of recombinant inbreed lines (RILs) resulting
from the cross between ecotypes from Groups 1 and 2 would allow
for a ﬁne dissection of the genetics underlying the differences in
response to TEV-At 17b infection. In this sense, RILs from the cross
Col-0× Ler-0 are already available (Lister and Dean, 1993).
