Grassland-based production systems use ∼26% of land surface on earth. However, there
are no evaluations of these systems as a source of antibiotic pollution. This study was
conducted to evaluate the presence, diversity, and distribution of tetracycline resistance
genes in the grasslands of the Colombian Andes, where administration of antibiotics to
animals is limited to treat disease and growth promoters are not included in animals’ diet.
Animal (ruminal ﬂuid and feces) and environmental (soil and water) samples were collected
from different dairy cattle farms and evaluated by PCR for the genes tet(M), tet(O), tetB(P),
tet(Q), tet(W), tet(S), tet(T), otr (A), which encode ribosomal protection proteins (RPPs),
and the genes tet(A), tet(B), tet(D), tet(H), tet(J), and tet(Z), encoding efﬂux pumps. A
wide distribution and high frequency for genes tet(W) and tet(Q) were found in both sam-
ple types. Genes tet(O) and tetB(P), detected in high frequencies in feces, were detected
in low frequencies or not detected at all in the environment. Other genes encoding RPPs,
such as tet(M), tet(S), and tet(T), were detected at very low frequencies and restricted
distributions. Genes encoding efﬂux pumps were not common in this region, and only two
of them, tet(B) and tet(Z), were detected. DGGE–PCR followed by comparative sequence
analysis of tet(W) and tet(Q) showed that the sequences detected in animals did not differ
from those coming from soil and water. Finally, the farms sampled in this study showed
more than 50% similarity in relation to the tet genes detected. In conclusion, there was
a remarkable presence of tet genes in these production systems and, although not all
genes detected in animal reservoirs were detected in the environment, there is a pre-
dominant distribution of tet(W) and tet(Q) in both animal and environmental reservoirs.
Sequence similarity analysis suggests the transmission of these genes from animals to
the environment.

INTRODUCTION
Antibiotics are broadly used around the world in concentrated ani-
mal feeding operations (CAFOs), not only to prevent and control
diseases but also to promote faster growth by mixing antibiotics
with livestock feed. These practices help reduce production costs
and retail prices to consumers. Nonetheless, the formation of
antibiotic resistant microbial pools in animal guts as a result of
antibiotic administration (Aminov et al., 2001; Aarestrup, 2005;
Sawant et al., 2007) is well documented. These pools have been
identiﬁed as the source of many antibiotic resistant pathogenic
bacteria transmitted to humans (van den Bogaard and Stobber-
ingh, 2000), and the consumption of meat, meat-derived products,
eggs, and food contaminated with antibiotic resistant zoonotic
bacterial pathogens, is considered the most common transmis-
sion route of antibiotic resistance from animal farms to humans
(Aarestrup, 2006).

An emergent concern is that antibiotic resistance could be
transmitted from environmental resistance reservoirs to humans

and animal pathogens by consuming polluted water or agricul-
tural food products. Environmental reservoirs of resistance may
be the result of three different process: the selective pressure
exerted by the antibiotics released in animal waste (Winckler and
Grafe, 2001; Campagnolo et al., 2002), the horizontal gene trans-
fer between the resistant bacteria released in feces and indigenous
bacteria (Götz and Smalla, 1997; Witte, 2000; Sengelov et al., 2003;
Schwarz et al., 2006; Heuer and Smalla, 2007; Binh et al., 2008),
and ﬁnally, natural selective pressures on the microbial commu-
nity (Aminov, 2009; Martinez, 2009). Previous studies conducted
in United States and Europe have shown the presence of tetracy-
cline resistance pools in surface and ground water of industrial
livestock facilities proving that CAFOs and land application of
manure are important sources of environmental antibiotic pollu-
tion that promote environmental reservoirs of resistance (Aminov
et al., 2001; Chee-Sanford et al., 2001; Koike et al., 2007; Patter-
son et al., 2007; Peak et al., 2007; Knapp et al., 2010; Heuer et al.,
2011).

tet Resistance in the Colombian Andes

Unlike industrial facilities, grassland-based production systems
rely upon natural vegetation growing in the ﬁeld for feeding ani-
mals that live off the land, with low numbers of livestock units
per area. The administration of antibiotics is restricted to disease
control, and no food concentrates containing antibiotics are used.
However, even though the amount of antibiotics administered to
animals in grasslands is signiﬁcantly lower to the amount admin-
istered in CAFOs, the possibility of animal and environmental
reservoirs of resistance, as a result of the livestock activity in these
extensive production systems, cannot be ruled out. It has been
demonstrated the presence of resistant bacteria in animals when
no growth promoters have been administered (Blake et al., 2003;
Bryan et al., 2004; Alexander et al., 2008). Despite the fact that
grasslands represent ∼26% of the land surface on earth (Steinfeld
et al., 2006), there are no evaluations of grassland-based systems
as a source of antibiotic pollution.

The ﬁrst objective of the present study was to evaluate the pres-
ence, distribution, and diversity of microbial genes encoding resis-
tance to the antibiotic tetracycline in animal (ruminal ﬂuid and
feces) and environmental (soil and water) samples from grassland-
based systems located in the tropical highlands of Colombia. The
presence of resistance in the total microbial community, including
viable but non-culturable bacteria, was evaluated by PCR detection
of the genes tet (M), tet (O), tet B(P), tet (Q), tet (W), tet (S), tet (T),
otr(A), which encode ribosomal protection proteins (RPPs), and

the genes tet (A), tet (B), tet (D), tet (H), tet (J), and tet (Z), encoding
tetracycline efﬂux pumps (Roberts, 2005). Tetracycline resistance
was chosen because this antibiotic is frequently used in Colom-
bia and other regions of the world for veterinary purposes. In
addition, no antibiotic resistance evaluations of the total micro-
bial community at the animal and environmental levels have been
previously conducted in Latin America and the Caribbean Region,
where grassland animal production is one of the most important
economic activities (FAO, 2008). The second objective of this study
was to establish whether the tet genes found in the environment of
the highlands were part of an intrinsic resistance in the indigenous
bacteria community or originating from the animal reservoirs in
the region.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STUDY SITE
This study evaluated six different grassland-based cattle farms,
mainly used for milk production: Manitas, Puente Luna, Granada,
Lindaraja,Alisos, and Corpoica. These sites are located on the East-
ern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes in a high plateau known
as Altiplano Cundiboyacense (Figure 1). The administration of
antibiotics to animals on these farms is limited to the treatment
of health problems. This limitation is part of a strict management
because the milk produced in the highlands of Colombia is pur-
chased by the dairy industry, and when traces of antibiotics are

found, the milk is rejected. In addition, many farms belong to
small producers who cannot pay the high cost of the drugs used
in this region.

The most often administered antibiotic in these farms is the
oxytetracycline dehydrate, followed by the ampicillin. Unfortu-
nately, farms managers do not keep record of dose and frequency
of use. Nonetheless, based on data supplied by veterinarians work-
ing for these extensive production systems, it was estimated that
the evaluated farms, with a number of animals between 60 and
100, use approximately between 13 and 130 g of oxytetracycline
dihydrate in a week. These values are well below the estimated
9 kg of chlortetracycline used per week in a medium size intensive
Colombian pig farm with 3000 animals.

SAMPLE COLLECTION
One sampling event was conducted at each farm where soil, water,
feces, and ruminal ﬂuid samples were collected.

Soil samples were collected from two different plots under the
inﬂuence of cattle waste. At each plot, four composite samples
were obtained, each resulting from four pooled soil cores. The soil
cores were randomly taken from the surface (0–5 cm) along four
transects ∼5 m apart and 10 m long.

Four composite feces samples were collected at one of the plots,
according to the sampling design described for soils. For this sam-
pling, 50 g of feces were taken from the inner center of a fresh cow
pie at each sampling point.

Runoff, ground, and animal drinking water samples were col-
lected depending on their availability at the sites. In all farms,
except Manitas, 50 ml samples of runoff water were collected from
a ditch draining system. In Manitas, runoff water samples were col-
lected from a pond where waters collect and remain stagnant. To
obtain the samples, a 50-ml sterile container was submerged about
50 cm below the water surface at different locations around the
waterbody. Animal drinking water samples had different sources
depending on the farm. In Puente Luna and Corpoica, animal
drinking water is the same potable water consumed by the human
population and is supplied by a municipal water processing plant.
In Granada, Lindaraja, and Alisos, animal drinking water is in situ
chemically treated runoff water. Approximately 100 ml of this
water was collected from cattle troughs in a sterile container. The
groundwater samples from active farming wells were collected
from the valve system installed at the head of each well. Water
ran for 30 min before ﬁlling a sterile 150 ml glass bottle.

Approximately 100 ml of ruminal ﬂuid was collected from each

animal using a bovine esophageal probe.

All samples were stored in a refrigerated cooler, transported to
the laboratory, and processed within 24 h. The number of collected
samples per farm and the number of samples analyzed are listed
in Table 1.

DNA EXTRACTION
Total DNA was extracted in duplicate from 0.5 g of each soil and
feces composite samples and from 0.5 ml of each ruminal ﬂuid
sample. DNA isolation was performed using the Ultra Clean DNA
kit from Mo Bio Laboratories Inc., according to manufacturer’s
instructions with modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, samples in the bead solu-
tion tubes containing SDS were boiled in water for 10 min before

proceeding with the protocol. Subsequently, an equal volume of
phenol was added to remove excess organic matter present in the
samples previously treated with the protein precipitation reagent.
After separating the phenol/aqueous phases by centrifugation, the
aqueous phase was mixed with the DNA binding salt solution and
passed through the silica membrane of the spin ﬁlter. Samples were
resuspended in 50 μl of the elution buffer (10 mM Tris Buffer, pH
8.5) and stored at −20˚C.

For DNA extraction, 50, 100, and 150 ml samples of runoff, ani-
mal drinking, and ground water, respectively, were ﬁltered through
a 25-mm polyester sulfone membrane with a 0.22-μm pore size
(Supor 200, Pall Corporation). Subsequently, the membranes were
cut into small squares of approximately 5 mm× 5 mm, and the
DNA was extracted with the Mo Bio kit as described previ-
ously, except the phenol step was omitted for the groundwater
samples.

POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION
Ampliﬁcation reactions were performed with a Labnet Thermal
Cycler in a ﬁnal reaction volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixtures
contained 1X PCR reaction buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 200 nM of each
dNTP, 200 nM of forward and reverse primers, 1U Taq polymerase
(Promega), 400 ng/μl BSA (Bioline), and 1 μl of DNA solution.
The following basic thermocycling program was used for all the
PCR reactions: 94˚C for 4 min (1 cycle); 94˚C for 50 s, X˚C for 40 s,
and 72˚C for 30 s (30 cycles); 72˚C for 4 min. The annealing tem-
perature (X) was speciﬁc for each primer pair used to amplify the
genes encoding for RPPs and tetracycline efﬂux pumps. Primers
details and annealing temperatures are described in Aminov et al.
(2001) and Aminov et al. (2002). DNA fragments of 250 bp, con-
taining annealing sequences for tet genes, were synthesized by
DNA Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA and used as posi-
tive controls. The control sequences were obtained from Aminov
et al. (2001, 2002). Negative controls were also included in each
PCR reaction. Before testing isolated DNA with tet primers, the
DNA quality was assessed by performing an initial ampliﬁcation
with the 16S rDNA universal Bacteria primers 8F and 1541R using
PCR conditions described by Lofﬂer et al. (2000).

To assess the similarity among sampled farms in terms of pres-
ence and frequency of the detected tet genes, a cluster analysis
was conducted based on the percentage similarity index and the
UPGMA method of hierarchical agglomeration using the XLSTAT
6.0 software (Addinsoft, NY, USA, 20011).

DENATURING GEL ELECTROPHORESIS ANALYSIS AND SEQUENCING OF
AMPLIFIED REGIONS
Animal and environmental DNA samples that were positive for
two of the most frequent genes were selected for PCR–Denaturing
gel electrophoresis analysis (DGGE). Positive tet samples were
newly ampliﬁed by PCR using a forward primer with a GC
tail (Kobayashi et al., 2007). PCR conditions were the same as
described before. The Bio-Rad D-Code Universal Mutation System
was used to analyze the polymorphisms found in these PCR prod-
ucts by loading 30 μl on an 8% polyacrylamide/bis acrylamide
37.5:1 gel in 1X TAE. The denaturing gradient was 30–50%, and
the electrophoresis was performed for 18 h at 40 V and 60˚C. To
visualize the DNA, gels were stained in ethidium bromide solution

(5 μg/ml), and digital images were taken using a UVP Gel Doc-It™
system.

Denaturing gel electrophoresis analysis bands were sequenced
to conﬁrm the identity of the ampliﬁed products and to compare
which PCR products originated from animal and environmental
samples. For the analysis, bands were excised from the gel and
stored in distilled water for 12 h. Water containing the diffused

template was used for PCR, and the reampliﬁcation products were
sequenced using a DYEnamic ET Dye terminator kit (MegaBACE)
on a MegBACE 1000 (GE Amersham) sequencer.

The identity of PCR amplicons was conﬁrmed by comparing
nucleotide sequences with the Gene Bank Database at National
Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) using the basic logical alignment
search tool (BLAST). Sequence alignment and cluster analysis,

including the tet genes from animal and environmental origin
detected in the present study and other studies, were performed
with Sequencher 4.1 and Clustal W.

RESULTS
DETECTION OF TETRACYCLINE RESISTANCE GENES
All of the farms evaluated were positive for tet genes in both animal
and environmental samples (Table 1). The detected genes include
tet (W), tet (Q), tet B(P), tet (O), tet (M), tet (S), tet (T), tet (B), and
tet (Z). The genes otr(A), tet (A), tet (D), tet (H), and tet (J) were not
detected in any sample. The highest detection frequencies were for
those genes encoding RPPs with 355 out of 388 positive PCR reac-
tions. Among this group, the most frequent were tet (W) with 36%
(140 out of 388), tet (Q) with 25% (98 out of 388), and tet (O) with
18% (70 out of 388; Table 2).

Considering the frequency of detection per sample type, feces
and ruminal ﬂuid showed the highest frequencies of PCR positives
for tet genes. Speciﬁcally, tet (O), tet (W), tet (Q), and tet B(P) were
present in 100, 98, 83, and 70% of the feces samples, respectively
(Table 2), while tet (W) and tet (Q) with frequencies of 100 and
80%, respectively, were the most common genes detected in the
ruminal ﬂuid. Genes tet (T) and tet (B) were also detected in feces,
although with low frequencies.

Generally, tet (W) and tet (Q) were detected simultaneously in
feces and runoff water samples from the farms, except in Lindaraja
and Puente Luna. In Lindaraja, tet (W) was detected only in feces,
while in Puente Luna both genes were found only in the feces sam-
ples (Table 1). Of all the genes that were detected simultaneously
in feces and runoff water, only tet (W) and tet (Q) were present in
soil samples at relatively high frequencies (Table 2). Treated runoff
water, used as animal drinking water in Granada, Lindaraja, and
Alisos, tested positive for the most common genes tet (W) and
tet (Q). Resistance was not detected in animal drinking water from
the municipal processing plant in Puente Luna; however, tet (W),
tet (S), and tet (O) were detected in the samples from Corpoica

(Table 1). Of the three groundwater samples analyzed, the sam-
ples collected from Granada and Corpoica were positive only for
genes tet (Q) and tet (S), respectively.

An analysis of the gene patterns detected per reservoir type
(Table 3) revealed that in four of the six sampled farms, the t et
gene diversity was higher in animal samples as compared with
the environmental samples. We also observed that the tet B(P)
gene was only found in animal samples, and in the contrast, the
genes tet (S) and tet (Z) were only found in environmental samples,
although at low frequencies (Table 2).

Cluster analysis shows that the geographically closest sites,
Puente Luna, Lindaraja, and Granada, are signiﬁcantly more simi-
lar in relation to the genes detected and their frequencies (Figures 1
and 2). Manitas is more distant from this group because the gene
tet (Z) was detected at this site but not tet (B/P). Corpoica is less
similar with the other sites due to the absence of gene tet (Q) and
the presence of genes tet (S). The tet (B) gene was not detected in
the other sampling sites.

DGGE AND SEQUENCE ANALYSIS
Denaturing gel electrophoresis analysis results did not show
genetic polymorphisms for tet (W) amplicons from any farm sam-
pled. Sequences originating from both, animals and environment,
exhibited a single band at the same gel level (data not shown).
Blast analysis conﬁrmed that the sequences of the bands corre-
sponded to gene tet (W), and the alignment analysis showed no
difference among the sequences from the samples, including the
positive control, B. ﬁbrisolvens (Nikolich et al., 1992). In addition,
Clustal W analysis conﬁrmed that the tet (W) sequences reported
in this study had 100% identity with more than 83% of counterpart
tet (W) sequences reported in databank.

In contrast, DGGE patterns for gene tet (Q) amplicons showed
several bands per sample (data not shown). Blast analysis con-
ﬁrmed that sequences of all the bands observed corresponded
to gene tet (Q), and the alignment analysis showed that most of

the bands in a sample shared the same sequence. We observed a
maximum of two bands with different tet (Q) genotypes within a
sample. The multiple bands for the same sequence in the DGGE
patterns of tet (Q) probably resulted from the presence of single-
stranded DNA and the formation of a PCR product with multiple
denaturation domains (Kocherginskaya et al., 2001; Kobayashi
et al., 2007; Calabria de Araujo and Schneider, 2008). Cluster
analysis classiﬁed 70 of the tet (Q) band sequences observed in
the DGGE analysis into ﬁve different groups based on nucleotide
variations, rather than the sample type (Figure 3). Only ﬁve dif-
ferent genotypes were found, which differed at position 32, where
a thymine had been replaced by cytosine and also at position 65
where a thymine was replaced by adenine or guanine as compared
with the positive control B. thetaiotaomicron (Aminov et al., 2001).
There were no particular tet (Q) genotypes associated exclusively

in environmental samples, although these sequences grouped
together with the control, which is a sequence of clinical origin
(Figure 3). Notably, most sequences were included in Group 5,
which was characterized by nucleotide changes at positions 32 and
65, where the thymine was replaced by an adenine. These changes
were also observed in tet (Q) nucleotide sequences previously
reported (Aminov and Mackie, 2007). According to Clustal and
Generunner analyses, these mutations do not produce changes in
the protein sequence when they are compared with the Tet(Q) pro-
tein of the reference strain B. thetaiotaomicron; in both positions,
the amino acid glycine is conserved.

DISCUSSION
Assessing the presence of resistance genes to the antibiotic tetra-
cycline in the highlands of Colombia has revealed not only resis-
tance reservoirs in dairy cattle raised in this region but also a
wide distribution of tet genes in the environment of grassland-
based production systems. The detection frequency and spatial
distribution of resistance genes in the runoff water and soils was
remarkable, especially for genes tet (W) and tet (Q). It is known
that resistant bacteria occur in nature as a result of natural selec-
tive pressures (Aminov, 2009; Martinez, 2009), as it was shown by
some studies reporting tetracycline resistance in a national park
and in fecal bacteria of wild animals in areas which apparently are
not under the exposure of urban or agricultural antibiotic contam-
ination (Gilliver et al., 1999; Yang et al., 2010; Rahman et al., 2008).

However, tet genes detected in the evaluated grasslands-based pro-
duction systems in Colombia, do not seem to be the result of
natural selective pressures. Instead, they are probably the result
of horizontal gene transfer because, the same tet (W) and tet (Q)

sequences were detected in animal, soil, and water samples. Addi-
tionally, it was not found any novel sequence for these genes at
the Altiplano region. Sequences detected for these genes did not
differ from most of the tet (Q) and tet (W) sequences reported in

the literature. It was not feasible to include in this study plots of
grazing land free areas in order to compare samples of natural
environments with those samples collected in the active grazing
plots. The vast majority of the land in the Altiplano Cundiboya-
cense is (or had been during the last decades) under the inﬂuence
of cattle waste given the predominant extensive cattle production
system. Therefore, it was not possible to determine the presence
and frequency of the tet genes in an environment of the Altiplano
that is not under the exposure of antibiotic contamination.

Cattle raised in the grassland-based production systems at the
highlands of Colombia, seem to be a source of tetracycline resis-
tance genes into the environment, especially those coding for RPPs.
This transmission was concluded on the basis that detection fre-
quencies for genes tet (Q) and tet (W) in the digestive tract of
the animals sampled in this region was greater than 80%, and
these genes were also common in the environmental samples, espe-
cially in water. Moreover, the sequences of the genes tet (W) and
tet (Q) detected in soil and water did not differ from those found
in samples of animal origin, and no otr(A) genes were detected
from antibiotic-producing bacteria. Finally, Lopez et al. (Submit-
ted manuscript) examined the presence of tet genes and their
sequences in 150 heterotrophic tetracycline resistant bacteria iso-
lated by culture techniques from the animal and environmental
samples analyzed in the present study. These data showed that
a high percentage of the isolates were positive for genes tet (W)
(53)% and tet (Q) (35%). Gene tet (W) did not show any genetic
polymorphism as it was observed for tet (W) sequences detected
in the total DNA samples. Sequences of gene tet (Q) detected in
the isolates, showed three different genotypes which were identi-
cal to those in group one, two, and ﬁve in Figure 3. These groups
included sequences detected in bacteria isolated from both, ani-
mal and environmental samples. 16S rRNA sequences analysis
of the bacteria isolates, revealed that genera where genes tet (W)
and tet (Q) were detected included Enterococcus, Staphylococcus,
Escherichia, Klebsiella and Shigella, and also non-strict patho-
genic, non-clinical bacteria commonly found in the environment
such as Burkholderia, Chryseobacterium, Variovorax, Acinetobac-
ter, Pseudomonas, and Dyella. Therefore, based on the foregoing,
it is likely that the resistance genes detected at the Altiplano
Cundiboyacense originated from animal reservoirs and are neither
associated with native bacteria genes that produce antibiotics nor
the result of selective pressure exerted by the tetracycline released
into the environment on microbial populations.

A comparison of gene patterns detected in animal and envi-
ronmental samples from the Altiplano (Table 3) revealed that the
detected genes are not equally distributed in animal and environ-
mental reservoirs. Despite having a 100% frequency of detection
in feces from all the sampling sites, gene tet (O) was not detected
in environmental samples from Puente Luna, Granada, and Lin-
daraja. Gene tet B(P), also with high frequencies of detection in
feces, was not detected in water or soil samples from any site.
These results are consistent with the mobility reported for tet
genes in the literature. Genes tet (W) and tet (Q), found in 18 and
15 different bacteria genera, respectively, have high transferability
rates because they are associated with conjugative chromosomal
elements encoding their own transfer (Roberts, 2005). However,
genes tet (O) and tet B(P), found in 10 and 1 bacteria genera,

respectively, are not normally associated with conjugative trans-
posons or other types of mobile genetic elements (Chopra and
Roberts, 2001; Roberts, 2005), which could limit the ﬂow of these
genes into soil and water bacteria.

Runoff water might be playing an important role in the trans-
mission of genes with genetic mobility to the regions of Altiplano
and the north of Colombia. This transmission is possible because
runoff water in the ditch systems, where samples were collected,
ﬂows into the Bogotá and Sogamoso watersheds, which in turn
drain into the Magdalena River Basin (Figure 1). Considering the
high detection frequencies of tet (Q) and tet (W) genes in runoff
waters and the high rainfall precipitation throughout most of the
year in this region (IDEAM, 2010) resistance genes might be dis-
persed by the waters of Magdalena because this river crosses the
country from north to south emptying into the great slope of
the Caribbean. Although this study did not analyze river water
impacted by runoff, Kobayashi et al. (2007) and Tao et al. (2010)
demonstrated the presence of resistance genes in waters and sed-
iments from rivers impacted by waste coming from developed
areas in southern Vietnam and China, where signiﬁcant amounts
of antibiotics are administrated to humans and animals.

There seems to be a geographical distribution of some tet genes
in the Altiplano region. Sampled farms showed more than 50%
similarity in relation to the detected tet genes and their frequencies
(Figure 2), and this similarity increases with decreasing geograph-
ical distances. For instance, Puente Luna, Granada, and Lindaraja,
close and under the inﬂuence of a dense hydrographic network
that ﬂows into the Sogamoso River, are signiﬁcantly more sim-
ilar to each other than to Corpoica, located further apart and
under the inﬂuence of a different hydrographic network that ﬂows
into the Bogota River. Moreover, the presence of genes tet (S) and
tet (T) and the absence of tet (Q) make Corpoica different from
the other sites. Manitas, a farm surrounded by fewer streams per
square kilometer was the only site positive for gene tet (Z) and
the only site where tet (B/P) was not detected. The differences in
the geographical distribution of some tet genes might result from
differences in the management practices for the administration of
antibiotics. Alexander et al. (2011), showed that cattle fed with dif-
ferent subtherapeutic antibiotics presented different abundances
of certain resistance genes. Future studies are needed to clarify
how the geographical location, presence of hydrological networks,
and management practices for the administration of antibiotics
determines the distribution of tet genes at the highland plateau of
the Altiplano Cundiboyacense.

Ruminal ﬂuid samples did not reveal the variety of tet genes
occurring in animals reservoirs as feces did. Genes tet B(P), tet (T),
and tet (B) were found in feces but not in the forestomach, may
be as a result of differences in the microbial populations along
the ruminant digestive tract. It has been demonstrated that rumen
and feces have different microbial communities as a result of dif-
ferences in the environmental conditions between rumen and the
end of the digestive tract, such as pH, degree of anaerobiosis,
and available substrates (Michelland et al., 2009; Callaway et al.,
2011). Therefore, genes tet (W) and tet (Q), reported in a wide
range of genera (Roberts, 2005), are detected in bacteria associ-
ated with both rumen and the end of the intestinal tract. However,
genes with narrow distribution ranges, such as tet B(P), tet (T),

and tet (B) (Roberts, 2005), were associated only with bacteria
at the end of the intestinal tract. In fact gene tet B(P) has been
only reported in Clostridium, one of the predominant genera in
feces (Callaway et al., 2011). Surprisingly, tet (M), although hav-
ing a wide distribution range (Roberts, 2005), was only present
in feces. This gene was not common on any sampled farm at the
Altiplano region; it was only detected in one feces sample from
Granada. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the presence of tet (M)
in the animal and environmental microbial community, where it
might be present at a low frequency, making it difﬁcult to detect
by PCR.

Genes tet (W), tet (Q), and tet (O), detected in higher frequen-
cies at the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, were also frequently detected
in studies conducted in the United States by Aminov et al. (2001)
and Peak et al. (2007) for ruminal content and waste water lagoons
near cattle feedlots. The most particular results found in this
present study were related to the frequencies detected for genes
tet (M) and tet B(P). Speciﬁcally, tet (M), often associated with con-
jugative transposons and identiﬁed in 35 genera from variety of
ecosystems, including humans, animals, and soils (Roberts, 2005),
was not common at the Altiplano Cundiboyacense. By contrast, in
other studies, it is reported as a common gene (Peak et al., 2007;
Alexander et al., 2011). Gene tet B(P), which is commonly found
in the intestinal tract of cows from most sampled farms in this
study, is not reported in previous studies of ruminal content, cow
feces, soil amended with cow manure, or waste water lagoons near
cattle feedlots conducted in Europe and the United States. Finally,
the most frequent genes found in the highlands of Colombia are
those encoding RPPs. Genes encoding membrane efﬂux pumps
are neither diverse nor frequent. Conversely, Sawant et al. (2007)
in the United States showed that genes tet (B) and tet (A) encoding
for efﬂux pumps, were the tet genes most frequently found in feces
of dairy cattle. Additionally, a study conducted by Kobashi et al.
(2007) in various agricultural environments of Japan, showed that
tet genes encoding efﬂux pumps were more frequent than those

encoding for RPPs. As far as we know, only Yang et al. (2010),
have reported in the USA that gene pools of tet (O) and tet (W),
were bigger than those encoding efﬂux pumps in fecal and water
samples of cattle operations.

In conclusion, grassland production systems at the highlands
plateau of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense present animal and envi-
ronmental reservoirs of tetracycline resistance genes, especially for
genes tet (W) and tet (Q) encoding RPPs. The high frequency of
detection of these genes in soil and water is probably the result
of horizontal gene transfer from fecal bacteria to environmental
bacteria. The range of diversity of the tet genes found in animal
reservoirs and particularly at the end of the animal digestive tract is
wider than for those found in soil and water, indicating that genes
encoding resistance do not have the same probability of trans-
mission to the environment. Runoff water might be an important
dissemination agent for the most frequent tet genes in this region;
however, the impact of inﬁltrated wastewaters on groundwater
appears to be lower, although it is necessary to include more
ground water sampling sites to reach a conclusion.
