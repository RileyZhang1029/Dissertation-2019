Abstract:  Microbial  virulence  and  their  resistance  to  multiple  drugs  have  obliged  researchers  to  look  for  novel  drug  
targets.  Virulence  of  pathogenic  microbes  is  regulated  by  signal  molecules  such  as  acylated  homoserine  lactone  (AHL) 
produced  during  a  cell  density  dependent  phenomenon  of  quorum  sensing  (QS).  In  contrast,  certain  microbes  produce 
AHL-lactonases and -acylases to degrade QS signals, also termed as quorum quenching. Mining sequenced genome data-
bases has revealed organisms possessing conserved domains for AHL-lactonases and –acylases: i) Streptomyces (Actino-
bacteria),  ii) Deinococcus  (Deinococcus-Thermus), iii) Hyphomonas ((cid:1)-Proteobacteria),  iv) Ralstonia ((cid:2)-Proteobacteria), 
v) Photorhabdus ((cid:3)-Proteobacteria), and certain marine gamma proteobacterium. Presence of genes for both the enzymes 
within  an  organism  was  observed  in  the  following:  i)  Deinococcus  radiodurans  R1,  ii)  Hyphomonas  neptunium  ATCC 
15444  and  iii)  Photorhabdus  luminescens  subsp.  laumondii  TTO1.  These  observations  are  supported  by  the  presence  
motifs  for  lactonase  and  acylase  in  these  strains.  Phylogenetic  analysis  and  multiple  sequence  alignment  of  the  gene  
sequences for AHL-lactonases and –acylases have revealed consensus sequences which can be used to design primers for 
amplifying  these  genes  even  among  mixed  cultures  and  metagenomes.  Quorum  quenching  can  be  exploited  to  prevent 
food spoilage, bacterial infections and bioremediation.

INTRODUCTION 

  The  advent  of  antibiotics  in  the  beginning  of  twentieth 
century  gave  a  new  lease  to  human  health  and  longevity  to 
life span. Ironically, usage of  antibiotics  to counter  the vari-
ous  diseases  caused  by  pathogenic  microbes  has  been  prov-
ing  quite  ineffective  during  the  last  decade  or  so.  The  situa-
tion  is  turning  alarmingly  grave  because  microbes  have  be-
come  increasingly  resistant  to  almost  all  the  antibiotics  in-
cluding those which had been approved quite recently [1, 2]. 
Pharmaceutical companies find it uneconomical to be in this 
evolutionary  race  with  multiple  drug  resistant  microbes  [3-
6].  In  fact,  microbes  have  evolved  defence  mechanisms 
against  antibiotics  by  exploiting  their  large  reservoir  of  
genetic  variability  [6].  The  needs  are  to  search  new  drug 
targets [7, 8] and /or attenuate bacterial pathogenicity [9] by 
preventing  dissemination  of  genes  conferring  resistance  and 
those  responsible  for  their  virulent  characteristics  [3]  and 
design drugs accordingly.  

  Among  the  various  microbial  pathogens,  those  notorious 
for  causing  high  morbidity  and  mortality  among  living 
beings initiate the infection process within specialized struc-
tures – biofilms, which enable microbes to withstand adverse

environmental  conditions,  such  as  the  host  defence  compo-
nents  and  drugs  including  antibiotics  used  for  treating  the 
disease  [10,  11].  Most  pathogenic  microbes  develop  it  in  a 
density  dependent  manner  by  a  process  termed  as  quorum 
sensing  (QS)  [12],  which  is  regulated  by  the  signal  molecu-
les  released  in  their  environment  [13].  In  Gram-negative 
bacteria, the most widely reported QS system is LuxR/I-type, 
where  signals  such  as  acylated  homoserine  lactones  (AHLs) 
regulate  the  expression  of  virulence  factors  like  elatase  and 
pycocyanin  production  by  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  [14], 
antibiotic  production  by  Erwinia  carotovora,  pigment  and 
antibiotic  production  by  Serratia  liquefaciens  [15].  The 
AHL-type pheromones differ in their specificity due to varia-
tions  in  acyl  chain  length,  degree  of  saturation  and  substitu-
tes at the third carbon of the lactone ring [16]. More than 70 
bacterial species produce AHL type QS [15, 17].  

 
In  contrast  to  AHL  mediated  QS,  which  allows  bacteria 
to compete  and dominate  the bacterial community,  there are 
others  which  have  developed  mechanisms  to  degrade  these 
signals. The process of interference with QS, known as quo-
rum  quenching  (QQ),  has  been  reported  among  prokaryotes 
and a few eukaryotic organisms [18, 19]. Bacteria are known 
to produce AHL-degrading enzymes such as AHL-lactonases 
and  AHL-acylases.  Lactonases  hydrolyze  the  lactone  ring  
of  AHL  and  are  found  in  numerous  Bacillus  spp.  [20,  21]. 
Heterologous  expression  of  aiiA  (encoding  for  AHL-
lactonase) from Bacillus spp. in Pseudomonas, Burkholderia 
and  Erwinia  resulted  in  marked  decrease  in  their  QS  signal

molecules  [22-24].  AHL-acylases  break  the  amide  linkages 
of the AHLs and have been reported to be produced by bac-
teria  such  as  Ralstonia  spp.  [25,  26]  and Pseudomonas  spp. 
[27-29].  Rhodococcus  erythropolis  W2  presents  an  interest-
ing  scenario,  as  it  possess  both  types  of  AHL-degrading  en-
zymes  [30-32].  Recently  proposals  have  been  floated  to  use 
QS signal molecules as potential drug targets to attenuate the 
virulence of pathogenic bacteria and use QQ to design novel 
drugs  [25].  The  large  reservoir  of  information  available  in 
sequenced  genomes  of  many  organisms  encouraged  us  to 
search for potential organisms [4, 33-35], which may possess 
either or both the enzymes for usage as potential drugs or as 
supplement to antibiotic based treatments.  

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY 

Phylogeny  of  Acyl-Homoserine  Lactone  Degrading  
Enzymes 

 
From  the  literature  available  in  public  domains,  we  col-
lected  protein  sequences  for  AHL-lactonase  from  Bacillus 
sp.  SB4  (Accession  No.  AAR85482.1)  and  AHL-acylase 
from  Ralstonia  sp.  XJ12B  (Accession  No.  AAO41113.1) 
from  NCBI  Protein  database.  The  nucleotide  sequences  of 
corresponding  protein  sequences  for  the  MEME  signature 
analysis  were  downloaded  from  the  NCBI  Genbank.  The 
conserved  domains  of  these  enzymes  from  reference  organ-
isms  have  been  presented  in  Fig.  (1). We  used  BLASTP  for 
the  similarity  searches  and  NCBI  Conserved  Domains  [36, 
37],  for  conserved  domain  search.  The  selected  sequences 
were  analyzed  to  get  similar  sequences  and  Conserved  Do-
mains  of  each  BLAST  hit.  We  selected  parameter  for  Max 
target  sequences  in  BLASTP  as  ~250  hits  (BLOSUM  62 
Matrix),  as  it  gives  results  with  large  number  of  sequences 
from same species.

SELECTION  OF  SEQUENCES  BY  HOMOLOGY 
SEARCH 

  The number of sequences in the each Table was reduced 
with respect to the homology among the same species using 
multiple  sequence  alignment  -  Neighbor  Joining  algorithm. 
We  selected  the  sequence  if  the  value  of  divergence  was 
more than 10% [38], others could be deleted. The homology 
search helped to reduce the number of sequences in the each 
Table  to  approximately  100.  This  was  done  primarily  to 
bring  down  redundancy  and  enable  preparation  of  phyloge-
netic trees of reasonable size.  

MULTIPLE  SEQUENCE  ALIGNMENT  (MSA)  AND 
RECONSTRUCTION OF PHYLOGENETIC TREE 

For  the  reconstruction  of  the  tree  we  have  collected  all 
 
the  protein  sequences  for  AHL-lactonase  and  AHL-acylase 
from  NCBI,  for  each  Table  nearly  100  sequences  were  se-
lected.  ClustalX  2.0.10  [39]  and  Tree  view  1.40  [40]  were 
used  for  the  multiple  sequence  alignments  and  phylogenetic 
tree reconstruction. Neighbor Joining algorithm was used for 
the  tree  reconstruction  and  Boot  Strap  value  used  was  1000 
(default value). And the tree constructed was visualized with 
the  Tree  view  software.  Multiple  aligned  sequences  were 
viewed  using  Jalview  to  find  out  the  conserved  region 
among them [41, 24].  

SIGNATURE  ANALYSIS  &  FINDING  REGULAR  
EXPRESSION, USING MEME 

  MEME  (Multiple  EM  for  Motif  Elicitation)  is  used  for 
searching for novel motifs or signatures in sets of biological 
sequences.  MEME  works  by  searching  for  repeated,  un-
gapped  sequence  patterns  that  occur  in  the  DNA  or  protein

sequences  [43-45].  MEME  searches  can  be  performed  
via  the  web  server  (http://meme.nbcr.net)  and  its  mirror  
sites  [44].  The  same  web  server  also  allows  access  to  motif 
alignment  and  search  tool  to  search  sequence  databases  for 
matches  to  motifs.  To  successfully  discover  motifs  with 
MEME,  it  is  necessary  to  choose  and  prepare  the  input  
sequences  carefully. Ideally,  the sequences should be <1000 
base pairs long [46]. 

  Data sets in FASTA format were submitted group wise in 
MEME  program  Version  4.0.0 
(http://meme.nbcr.net/ 
meme4/cgi-bin/meme.cgi).  In  order  to  obtain  maximum 
number  of  motifs  in  our  sequences,  we  modified  default  
settings  from  3  motifs  to  10  motifs.  MEME  search  stops 
when  this  number  of  motifs  has  been  found,  or  when  none 
can  be  found  with  E-value  less  than  10000  (http://meme. 
nbcr.net/meme4/meme-input.html#width).  We  used  default 
setting  zero or one motif per sequence  to get the occurrence 
of  single  motif  which  is  distributed  among  the  sequences. 
The default value of motif widths, set between 6 (minimum) 
and 50 (maximum) were modified and re-set between 25 and 
30, respectively. Each of the 10 signatures (25 to 30 nucleo-
tides  long)  (Table  S2  to  S17)  was  checked  for  its  frequency 
of  occurrence  among  all  the  sequences  of  a  particular  taxo-
nomic group and the ones with highest frequency and did not 
appear in other taxonomic groups were considered unique to 
a particular reference taxonomic group.  

 
In  our  analysis,  sequences  from  each  taxonomic  group 
were  analyzed  for  signature  using  MEME  [43].  The  MEME 
result  gives  a  graphic  representation  and  Motifs  in  regular 
expression format.  MEME analysis were conducted for each 
taxa  like  Actinobacteria,  Firmicutes,  (cid:1)-,  (cid:3)-,  (cid:4)-,  and  (cid:2)-
Proteobacteria,  Ascomycota,  Bacteroidetes,  Euryarchaeota. 
The number of sequences of (cid:4)-Proteobacteria with reference 
to acylase from Ralstonia sp.  Table were too  large to be ac-
commodated on line by the MEME Software (Word limit up 
to  60,000).  In  this  case,  we  segregated  the  members  of  (cid:4)-
bacterial group and made three case studies and searched for 
the  signatures  in  i)  Pseudomonas  spp.,  ii)  Shewanella  spp. 
and  iii)  rest  of  the  organisms  (Designated  as  Others).  The 
signatures  obtained  from  the  MEME  program  were  cross-
checked in other Tables and the other taxa in the same Table 
using online tool Sequence Manipulation Suite SMS [47]. 

VALIDATION  OF  SIGNATURES  AND  REGULAR 
EXPRESSIONS  

  The unique signatures - obtained after crosschecking with 
other  taxonomic  groups  -  were  used  as  query  sequence  to 
BLAST  against  the  sequenced  microbial  genomes  available 
in  NCBI  database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/),  to  vali-
date  them  [45].  Phylogenetic  trees  based  on  complete  se-
quence  of  the  gene  and  the  strings  based  on  the  signatures 
were  compared  for  AHL-lactonase  among  Firmicutes  and 
AHL-acylase  among  (cid:4)-Proteobacteria  –  Pseudomonas  spp. 
For  developing  strings,  each  of  the  10  signatures  was  repre-
sented by a single alphabet - A to J.  

RESULTS 

  Quorum  sensing  phenomenon  has  been  reported  from  a 
wide  range  of  organisms,  which  employ  these  primarily  to 
sense  environmental  stress  by  releasing  signal  molecules:  i) 

AHL  by  Gram-negative  bacteria  and  ii)  oligopeptides  by 
Gram-positive  bacteria.  In  contrast,  quite  a  few  organisms 
also  have  the  abilities  to  degrade  these  signal  molecules  to 
ensure  their  survival.  Here  we  are  presenting  the  phyloge-
netic  diversity  of  AHL 
inactivating  enzymes:  AHL-
lactonases  and  AHL-acylases,  which  act  by  hydrolyzing  the 
lactone ring and by cleaving the acyl chain, respectively.  

PHYLOGENY  OF  AHL-LACTONASE  AND  AHL-
ACYLASE 

  Using  Bacillus  sp.  SB4  AHL-lactonase  (Accession  No. 
AAR854821)  (Fig.  1)  amino  acid  sequences  as  reference, 
BLAST  resulted  in  detecting  110  sequences  in  different  or-
ganisms showing completely conserved domains (Table S1). 
Sequences  for  this  enzyme  were  found  to  be  distributed 
among organisms belonging to Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, 
Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, 
(cid:1)-Proteobacteria,  (cid:3)-Proteobacteria,  (cid:4)-Proteobacteria,  (cid:2)-
Proteobacteria,  Euryarchaeota,  Crenarchaeota,  Sphingo- 
bacteria,  Spirochaetales,  Nitrospirales,  and  Planctomycetes. 
Among  these,  two  major  groups  of  organisms  possessing 
AHL-lactonase  were  represented  by  Firmicutes  –  12  genera 
and  22  spp.  and  (cid:1)-Proteobacteria  –  18  genera  and  22  spp. 
(Table S1). 

  On  the  other  hand,  with  Ralstonia  sp.  XJ12B  AHL-
acylase  (Accession  No:  AAO41113.1)  (Fig.  1)  as  reference, 
BLAST  resulted  in  detecting  94  sequences  of  different  or-
ganisms showing completely conserved domains (Table S1). 
The  distribution  of  sequences  for  AHL-acylase  was  rather 
limited  in  comparison  to  AHL-lactonase.  It  was  found 
among Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria,  Bacteroidetes, Deino-
coccus-Thermus,  Firmicutes,  (cid:1)-Proteobacteria,  (cid:3)-Proteo- 
bacteria,  (cid:4)-Proteobacteria,  (cid:2)-Proteobacteria,  Euryarchaeota 
and  Crenarchaeota.  The  distribution  pattern  of  this  enzyme 
was  in  clear  contrast  to  that  of  AHL-lactonase.  The  largest 
group  of  organisms  (59)  possessing  AHL-acylase  belonged 
to (cid:4)-Proteobacteria - 20 genera and 31 spp. Here, Firmicutes 
and (cid:1)-Proteobacteria were  among the smaller groups consti-
tuted  by  3  and  10  genera,  respectively.  The  frequency  of 
occurrence  of  AHL-acylase  was  relatively  low  among  other 
Proteobacteria.  Another  contrasting  scenario  was  observed 
among  cyanobacterial  members,  which  were  found  to  pos-
sess  only  AHL-acylase.  On  the  other  hand,  organisms  be-
longing  to  Acidobacteria,  Sphingobacteria,  Spirochaetales, 
Nitrospirales and Planctomycetes were found to possess only 
AHL-lactonase (Table S1). 

  Multiple  sequence  alignment  of  all  the  sequences  re-
vealed  that  conserved  regions  for  gene  encoding  for  AHL-
lactonase and AHL-acylase are located at the positions rang-
ing  i)  from  467  to  484,  557  to  571  and  737  to  755  and  ii) 
from  236  to  254  and  1892  to  1907  nts,  respectively  (Table 
1). These regions can be used for designing ‘universal’ prim-
ers  for  amplifying  genes  from  diverse  taxonomic  classes.  In 
addition,  certain  conserved  regions  were  also  observed 
within  each  taxonomic  group,  which  can  be  exploited  for 
amplifying  genes  specific  to  them.  The  following  conserved 
sequences  can  be  used  for  amplifying 
i)  
Firmicutes  -  TA[CT]ATTA  at  positions  535  to  542  nts,  and 
ATATCGT  at  774  to  780  nts,  ii)  (cid:3)-Proteobacteria  -  CGCA-
GACCA  at  681  to  689  nts,  and  CGG[AC]CG  at  521  to  523 

lactonase:

nts,  etc.  Similar  regions  were  also  observed  among  (cid:4)-
Proteobacteria,  (cid:2)-Proteobacteria  and  Ascomycota  for  lacto-
nase  gene  (Table  1)  and  acylase  type  gene  among  Actino- 
bacteria,  Cyanobacteria,  (cid:1)-Proteobacteria,  (cid:3)-Proteobacteria 
and Bacteroidetes (Table 1).

cies  were  observed  for  AHL-lactonase  (Figs.  2,3,  Table  2), 
the notable being the associations between  i) Moorella ther-
moacetica  ATCC  39073  (Firmicutes)  and  Burkholderia 
graminis  C4D1M  ((cid:3)-Proteobacteria)  (Boot  Strap  Value,  BV

cus-Thermus)  and  Xylella  fastidiosa  ((cid:4)-Proteobacteria)  (BV 
1000).  Similarly,  certain  taxonomic  discrepancies  were  also 
recorded  in  the  phylogenetic  tree  (Figs. 4,5,  Table  2)  drawn 
with  respect  to  sequences  of  organisms  possessing  AHL-
acylase: i) Solibacter usitatus Ellin 6076 (Acidobacteria) and 
Plesiocystis pacifica SIR-1 ((cid:2)-Proteobacteria) (BV 1000), ii) 
D.  radiodurans  R1  (Deinococcus-Thermus)  and  Ralstonia

stonia  sp.  XJ12B  ((cid:3)-Proteobacteria  (BV  1000).  Since  these 
associations  between  widely  distributed  organisms  show 
very  high  BVs,  these  may  be  interesting  cases  of  horizontal 
gene transfers. 

ORGANISMS  POSSESSING  GENES  FOR  AHL-
LACTONASE AND AHL-ACYLASE 

 
Sixteen bacterial strains of 5 different genera and a group 
of  3  strains  belonging  to  marine  gamma  proteobacterium 

were  found  to  possess  genes  for  both  the  enzyme  types: 
AHL-lactonase  and AHL-acylase (Table 3). The diversity of 
these  19  strains  was  evident  by  their  distribution  among  5 
different taxonomic groups: i) Streptomyces spp. (Actinobac-
teria),  ii)  Deinococcus  spp.  (Deinococcus-Thermus),  iii) 
Hyphomonas  sp.  ((cid:1)-Proteobacteria),  iv)  Ralstonia  spp.  ((cid:3)-
Proteobacteria),  v)  Photorhabdus  sp.  ((cid:4)-Proteobacteria),  vi) 
marine  gamma  proteobacterium.  Three  out  of  these  19  stra-
ins  can  be  more  clearly  classified  as  those  which  possessed 
genes  for  both  the  enzyme  types:  i)  D.  radiodurans  R1,  ii) 
Hyphomonas neptunium ATCC 15444 and iii) Photorhabdus 
luminescens  subsp.  laumondii  TTO1.  This  observation  is 
supported by the presence motifs for lactonase and acylase in 
these strains. 

SIGNATURE  ANALYSIS  –  FREQUENCY  AND  DIS-
TRIBUTION PATTERN 

  Ten  signatures  (nucleotides)  were  obtained  through 
MEME  for  different  taxonomic  groups  with  reference  to:  i) 
AHL-lactonase  gene  (aiiA)  of  Bacillus  sp.  SB4  Accession 
No.  AAR85482.1  (Figs.  S1  to  S8  and  Tables  S2  to  S9)  and 
ii)  AHL-acylase  gene  (aiiD)  of  Ralstonia sp.  XJ12B  Acces-
sion  No.  AAO41113.1  (Figs.  S9  to  S19  and  Tables  S10  to 
S17). (See Additional File 4 for a description of data in Tables 
S2 to S17 and Figs. S1 to S17). Nucleotide signatures found 
to  be  present  at  high  frequency  within  the  taxonomic  group 
and  absent  from  all  other  groups  were  initially  classified  as

unique. The BLAST (against the NCBI database) result vali-
dated  the  uniqueness  of  these  signatures  (Table  4).  A  high 
correlation  was  recorded  for  signatures  M1  and  M10  of Ba-
cillus sp. SB4 and their occurrence among a large number of 
organisms possessing AHL-lactonase (BLAST hits with high 
frequency).  Similarly,  among  the  different  signatures  identi-
fied  within  each  taxonomic  group  for  AHL-acylase,  those 
retrieved  from  Pseudomonas  spp.  within  (cid:2)-Proteobacteria 
gave  the  BLAST  hits  with  high  frequency  for  organisms  of 
this  taxonomic  group.  Sequence  homology  searches  using 
BLAST  for  all  other  signatures  showed  best  hits  for  the 
query  sequence  from  the  respective  taxonomic  group  but 
their frequency among the top 50 hits was quite low. 

DISCUSSION 

Bacteria with Ability to Quench QS Signals 

erythropolis  W2  [30-32],  we  also  looked  for  certain  other 
organisms  with  potential  to  produce  both  these  enzyme 
types.  Our  in  silico  study  allowed  us  to  identify  organisms 
from  five  different  genera  with  potential  to  produce  both 
types  of  AHL-degrading  enzymes.  The  three  strains  i)  D. 
radiodurans  R1,  ii)  H.  neptunium  ATCC  15444  and  iii)  P. 
luminescens subsp. laumondii TTO1 are  among the top con-
tenders  for  producing  both  the  enzzyme  type  from  an  indi-
vidual  strain.  However,  more  such  strains  can  be  tracked 
among  strains  belonging  to  Streptomyces  spp.  (Actinobacte-
ria), ii) Ralstonia spp. ((cid:1)-Proteobacteria), and marine gamma 
proteobacterium.  In  order  to  reduce  the  efforts  needed  to 
search  organims,  conserved  regions  can  be  used  for  desig-
ning  primers  for  amplifying  these  genes.  Signature  sequen-
ces deduced in this study can be used as an additional tool to 
assign  these  sequences  to  respective  taxonomic  groups,  at 
least in some cases. 

  With  the  information  available  in  the  literature  on  the 
presence of AHL-lactonase and AHL-acylase activities  in R. 

  Another  interesting  features  of  this  in  silico  study  is  that 
R.  solanacearum  GMI1000  ((cid:1)-Proteobacteria)  has  been

found  to  possses  gene  and  motif  for  AHL-acylase.  This  ob-
servation  finds  support  from  the  work  which  demonstrates 
the presence of AHL-acylase in R. solanacearum GMI1000, 
through  cloning  and  expression  of  aac  gene  [25].  It  led  to 
inactivation of four different AHLs [25]. Another interesting 
observation  was  the  presence  of  genes  for  quenching  the  
QS  signals  in  archaeal  member  A.  fulgidus.  Although  
archaea have not been reported so far to be directly involved 
in  causing  infectious  diseases  [48],  however,  there  are  
evidences  of  their  presence  in  endodonic  infections  [49].  
The  presence  of  these  genes  support  the  possibility  of  their 
role in infections.  

MOTIFS  OF  AHL-LACTONASES  AND  AHL-
ACYLASES 

  AHL-lactonase  is  a  member  of  metallo-hydrolase  super-
family containing the motif: His104-X-His106-X-Asp108-His109, 
which resembles zinc binding motif of several other metallo-
enzymes  such  as  glyoxalase  II,  aryl  sulfatase  and  (cid:2)-
lactamase.  The  motif  His106-X-Asp108-His109-59X-His169-
21X-Asp191  has  been  reported  to  be  essential  for  AHL-
lactonase activity [18, 22]. 

  A very interesting scenario was observed while searching 
for  motifs  essential  for  AHL-lactonase  enzyme  activities.  It 
was observed to be that motif essential for AHL-lactonases - 
His106-X-Asp108-His109-59X-His169-21X-Asp191  was  present 
in  all  the  organisms  having  potential  for  AHL-lactonase  ex-
cept  R.  solanacearum  GMI1000,  A.  baumannii  AB0057,  A. 
baumannii  ACICU,  A.  baumannii  AYE,  Acinetobacter  sp. 
ADP1  and  Pseudomonas  stutzeri A1501  (Table  3).  Inciden-
tally, these latter 6 bacteria lacked even the motif specific for 
metallo-enzymes  in  genral-  His104-X-His106-X-Asp108-His109.

literature  reveals 

  Available 
that  AHL-acylases  are  
structurally  similar  with  respect  to  the  two  amino-acids  at 
positions  50  and  57  [18]  as  a)  AiiD  of Ralstonia  sp.  XJ12B 
has Ile50 and Ser57 [26], b) PvdQ of P. aeruginosa PAO1 has 
Leu50  and  Asp57  [27],  and  c)  AhlM  of  Streptomyces  sp.  
has  Leu50  and  Ser  57  [50].  These  share  features  with  Ntn  
hydrolases  including  the  signal  peptide,  (cid:1)-  and  (cid:2)-subunits 
[51].  

  On  the  other  hand,  Cephalosporin-acylase  has  Gln  and 
Arg  at  positions  50  and  57  respectively  [18].  Our  analysis 
reveals  that  most of  the organisms had amino-acids of AHL 
acylase  in  a  slightly  different  positions  than  those  reported  
in  the  literature  (Table  3).  Unique  features  were  observed  
in  i)  Streptomyces  spp.,  where  the  amino  acids  of  motif  for 
acylase  resembled  either  those  found  in  PvdQ  or  were  a 
combination  of  Ile  of  AiiD  and  Asp  of  PvdQ,  ii)  Ralstonia 
spp.,  where  Ser  was  substituted  with  Asp  and  also  that  
Ralstonia  sp.  XJ12B  was  found  to  posses  two  motifs  –  a) 
Ile52  and  Ser59  and  b)  Ile49  and  Asp56.  In  view  of  the  fact  
that  in  spite  of  such  a  large  number  of  organisms,  which  
had  the  conserved  domains  for  AHL-acylase,  only  few  
seem  to  have  retained  the  property  observed  at  respective 
positions  as  reported  in  literature  [18,  26,  27,  50].  It  may  
not be too  inappropriate to conclude that amino-acids at po-
sitions  50  and  57  might  have  changed  during  the  course  
of evolution.  

  A  few  other  organisms  which  deserve  attention  are:  i) 
Burkholderia  spp.  ((cid:2)-Proteobacteria),  which  had  motifs  for 

Quorum Quenching Enzymes

lactonase  and  cephalosporin  acylase,  ii)  Pseudomonas  sp.  
((cid:1)-Proteobacteria),  which  possessed  two  motifs  for  AHL-
acylase  and  one  for  cephalosporin  acylase,  and  iii)  A.  
baumannii  AYE  ((cid:1)-Proteobacteria),  which  showed  motifs  
for cephalosporin acylase. 

USING SIGNATURES TO DESIGN PRIMERS  

  Bacillus  spp.  and  Pseudomonas  spp.  have  been  reported 
to  possess  repeating  elements  in  the  16S  rDNA  [2,  45]. We 
observed  such  repeats  in  the  AHL-lactonase  and  -acylase 
gene in different members of these two genera. Individually, 
these  signatures  were  validated  by  using  them  as  query  se-
quences  in  BLAST  search.  Since  the  frequency  of  repeating 
elements  in  this  gene  was  quite  high  in  the  case  of  Pseudo-
monas  spp.,  we  also  checked  them  for  regular  expressions 
[52].  We  observed  a  very  good  co-relation  between  the  full 
length  gene  sequence  and  the  strings  (Fig.  S18a,  b).  The 
nucleotide  signatures  identified  in  our  study  for  each  taxo-
nomic  group  may  enable  one  to  design  primers  to  amplify 
genes  for  AHL-lactonase  [20,  24,  53]  or  AHL-acylase  and 
identify  a  possible  taxonomic  group  within  a  microbial 
community.  

THE ROLE OF QUORUM QUENCHERS 

  The  role  of  QQ  enzymes  in  vivo  is  debatable  [54].  They 
may  be  involved  in  metabolic  pathways  where  AHL  and  its 
products may be used as energy and carbon sources -such as 
by  Variovorax  paradoxus  and  Arthrobacter  spp.  [55-57]. 
AHL-acylase  PvdQ  from  P.  aeruginosa  is  thought  to  be  in-
volved in biosynthesis of protein (pyoverdine) necessary for 
acquisition  of  iron  [28,  54,  58].  The  role  of  the  enzymes  – 
lactonase  and  acylase  for  QQ  has  been  proposed  to  prevent 
food,  prevent  biofilm  growth,  surface  fouling,  treatment  of 
bacterial  infections,  etc.  [59].  It  can  act  as  a  potential  drug, 
which  will  selectively  block  the  virulence  and  pathogenic 
traits  [60].  Heterologous  expression  of  Bacillus  AiiA  lacto-
nase  in  Burkholderia  thailandensis  [24],  in  P.  aeruginosa 
PAO1  [23],  in  Vibrio  harveyi  [53],  in  E.  carotovora  [22] 
have  been  found  to  disrupt  QS  mediated  properties.  In  fact, 
certain  antibiotics  become  effective  on  biofilms  which  have 
been exposed to AHL degrading enzymes [61], which imply 
a  combination  of  the  two  treatments  can  be  complementary 
and  effective  in  controlling  the  pathogenic  organism(s).  
Although  there  may  be  barriers  to  their  diffusion  within  the 
microbial  communities  in  the  soil  environment,  however, 
their  usage  as  a  drug  may  not  face  similar  barriers  and  may 
prove effective.  

CONCLUSION 

  Using  available  metabolic  and  genomic  databases  data-
bases, we have been able to trace potential organisms such as 
i)  Deinococcus  radiodurans  R1,  ii) Hyphomonas  neptunium 
ATCC  15444  and  iii)  Photorhabdus  luminescens  subsp. 
laumondii TTO1 to possess genes for AHL-lactonases and –
acylases.  In  addition,  all  the  cyanobacterial  members  were 
found to possess genes only for AHL-acylase whereas mem-
bers  of  Acidobacteria,  Sphingobacteria,  Spirochaetales,  Ni-
trospirales  and  Planctomycetes  were  found  to  possess  genes 
only  for  AHL-lactonase.  It  also  revealed  those  bacteria 

which  evolved  to  produce  either  of  the  two  enzymes,  an  in-
dication  of  the  environmental  stresses  encountered  during 
their evolution. The presence of genes for quenching the QS 
signals  in  archaea  has  further  increased  the  range  of  organ-
isms which can be exploited for producing these enzymes for 
preventing  food  spoilage,  bioremediation  and  design  drugs 
against bacterial infections. 

 
Phylogenetic  analyses  and  multiple  sequence  alignment 
of  the  gene  sequences  coding  for  the  two  enzymes  revealed 
consensus  sequences,  which  can  be  used  to  design  primers 
for  amplifying  these  genes  even  among  mixed  cultures  and 
metagenomes.  Nucleotide  signature  sequences  deduced  in 
this  study  can  be  used  as  an  additional  tool  to  assign  these 
sequences  to  respective  taxonomic  groups.  A  few  phyloge-
netic  discrepancies  observed  for  AHL-lactonase  and  –
acylase  may  imply  HGT  and  help  us  identify  those  organ-
isms  which  can  be  subjected  to  genetic  engineering  with  a 
relative ease. 

It  has  been  proposed  that  since  lactonase  activity  is  not 
 
influenced by the acyl chain length of the AHL signal mole-
cule,  hydrolysis  of  the  ring  may  be  more  effectve  approach 
for  QQ.  As  a  wide  range  of  Bacillus  spp.  have  an  ability  to 
produce lactonase,  it may be the organism of choice in futu-
re. The usage of Bacillus is quite beneficial since it has been 
labeled as industrial workhorse and accorded the designation 
GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) by FDA. These organ-
isms can be exploited for producing drugs against pathogens.
