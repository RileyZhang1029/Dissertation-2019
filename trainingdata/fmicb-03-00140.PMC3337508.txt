Cyanobacterial mats are often a major biological component of extreme aquatic ecosys-
tems, and in polar lakes and streams they may account for the dominant fraction of total
ecosystem biomass and productivity. In this study we examined the vertical structure and
physiology of Arctic microbial mats relative to the question of how these communities
may respond to ongoing environmental change. The mats were sampled from Ward Hunt
Lake (83˚5.297(cid:2)N, 74˚9.985(cid:2)W) at the northern coast of Arctic Canada, and were composed
of three visibly distinct layers. Microsensor proﬁling showed that there were strong gra-
dients in oxygen within each layer, with an overall decrease from 100% saturation at the
mat surface to 0%, at the bottom, accompanied by an increase of 0.6 pH units down the
proﬁle. Gene clone libraries (16S rRNA) revealed the presence of Oscillatorian sequences
throughout the mat, while Nostoc related species dominated the two upper layers, and
Nostocales and Synechococcales sequences were common in the bottom layer. High per-
formance liquid chromatography analyses showed a parallel gradient in pigments, from
high concentrations of UV-screening scytonemin in the upper layer to increasing zeax-
anthin and myxoxanthin in the bottom layer, and an overall shift from photoprotective to
photosynthetic carotenoids down the proﬁle. Climate change is likely to be accompanied by
lake level ﬂuctuations and evaporative concentration of salts, and thus increased osmotic
stress of the littoral mat communities. To assess the cellular capacity to tolerate increas-
ing osmolarity on physiology and cell membrane integrity, mat sections were exposed to
a gradient of increasing salinities, and PAM measurements of in vivo chlorophyll ﬂuores-
cence were made to assess changes in maximum quantum yield. The results showed that
the mats were tolerant of up to a 46-fold increase in salinity. These features imply that
cyanobacterial mats are resilient to ongoing climate change, and that in the absence of
major biological perturbations, these vertically structured communities will continue to be
a prominent feature of polar aquatic ecosystems.

INTRODUCTION
Cyanobacterial mats are well known for their ecological success
in extreme environments (Stal and Krumbein, 1985). Some of
the most striking examples occur in the polar regions where
cyanobacterial mats often dominate the biomass and produc-
tivity of freshwater ecosystems (Vincent, 2000). This ubiquitous
and abundant distribution has been attributed to the ability of
Arctic and Antarctic cyanobacterial communities to withstand
extreme conditions of the polar environment including contin-
uous solar radiation (UV and photosynthetically active radiation,
PAR) during summer, persistent cold temperatures, and freeze–
thaw cycles (Zakhia et al., 2008). These ambient conditions of
the Arctic are currently being modiﬁed by the impacts of global
climate change. Observations and models show faster climatic
changes in the Arctic than at other latitudes, with a rate of atmos-
pheric warming over the last four decades that has been up to

three times greater than the global average (Serreze and Francis,
2006), and this trend is likely to continue in the future (IPCC,
2007).

Two major impacts of warming on Arctic lakes are reduced
thickness and duration ice cover, and a shift toward an increas-
ingly negative precipitation minus evaporation balance. The latter
is favored by increased evaporation at warmer lake water tem-
peratures, as well as the increasing exposure of the lakes to the
atmosphere during a longer ice-free season. For some High Arctic
lakes this has led to increased salinities, and in some cases, complete
evaporation to dryness (Smol and Douglas, 2007). Cyanobacterial
mats living in these shallow water ecosystems will be increasingly
subject to the osmotic stresses of solute concentration and desicca-
tion. These effects may be further compounded by salt-exclusion
during freeze-up of shallow water lakes (Schmidt et al., 1991)
and the littoral zone of deeper lakes. Cyanobacteria have long

of continuous light during summer (Mueller et al., 2005). Micro-
bial mats occur in the seasonally ice-free littoral zone along the
northern and western sides of the lake. Although, phytoplankton
in this oligotrophic lake are strongly nutrient limited, high concen-
trations of nutrients have been recorded in the interstitial waters of
the mats (Villeneuve et al., 2001), and in 2-week bioassays the mat
phototrophs showed no response to nutrient enrichment (Bonilla
et al., 2005).

FIELD SAMPLING
Temperature, oxygen, and conductivity of lake water in the lit-
toral zone were measured on July 10, 2011 using a Hydrolab DS5X
proﬁler (Loveland, CO, USA).

The mats were sampled from 10 to 20 cm water depth in July
2010 and 2011. The samples were placed in a cooler with lake water
and taken directly to a ﬁeld laboratory. Microenvironmental gradi-
ents within the mats were assessed within 20–40 min of collection
using micromanipulator-controlled, 10 μm diameter Unisense
microsensors for oxygen and pH (Unisense, Aarhus, Denmark),
with accurate positioning to within 10 μm. The microsensor mea-
surements were made at 100 μm intervals to obtain vertical proﬁles
through the mats.

The cyanobacterial mats samples were separated at the ﬁeld
laboratory into three layers: surface black colonies, an upper pink
layer, and a lower green layer (Figure 1). Subsamples for HPLC
analysis of the three layers were placed into a dry-shipper (previ-
ously cooled with liquid nitrogen) in the ﬁeld and transferred to
−80˚C storage until pigment analysis. Samples for DNA extrac-
−1 EDTA;
tion were stored in 1.5 mL of buffer (1.8 mL of 40 mmol L
−1 sucrose) and kept frozen
50 mmol L
in the dry-shipper in the ﬁeld and transferred to −80˚C storage
until analysis.

been known to be tolerant of salinity ﬂuctuations, but to a vari-
able extent among taxa (Mackay et al., 1984), and osmotic effects
have not been assessed in the Arctic where the physiological stress
may be exacerbated by cold ambient temperatures. Both evapo-
ration and salt-exclusion contribute to high salinity and the polar
microbial mats are exposed to higher salinities in liquid water
compared to microbial mats at lower latitudes. Reduced ice cover
(and its associated snow; Belzile et al., 2001) also results in greater
exposure to solar UV radiation, which is increasing over the Arc-
tic as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion (Manney et al.,
2011).

The phylogenetic composition of temperate latitude microbial
mats has been extensively studied (e.g., Balskus et al., 2011; Bolhuis
and Stal, 2011) and these communities contain diverse cyanobac-
teria, other Bacteria, and some eukaryotes. However, despite their
ubiquitous distribution throughout the Arctic, in lakes, ponds and
streams, the community composition, and structure of micro-
bial mats in northern Polar Regions is much less studied. Initial
surveys of bacteria (Bottos et al., 2008), cyanobacteria (Jungblut
et al., 2010), and one metagenomic study of mats on Arctic ice
shelves, has conﬁrmed the diversity of cyanobacteria along with
other Bacteria, notably Proteobacteria, and Archaea (Varin et al.,
2010). The ice shelf mats also provide a protected habitat for
eukaryotes including diatoms, chlorophytes, ﬂagellates, ciliates,
and microinvertebrates (Vincent, 2000).

Most studies to date on high latitude microbial mats have
focused on their bulk taxonomic, pigment, and physiological
characteristics; however there is also evidence of strong vertical
gradients in these properties within such communities (e.g., Que-
sada et al., 1999; Hawes and Schwarz, 2001). Such gradients are
also well known from temperate latitude mats. For example, a
study conducted on microbial mats of the intertidal zone showed
major vertical changes down the mat proﬁle in coloration, pigment
content, and phylogenetic composition (Balskus et al., 2011).

Our aims in the present study were to characterize cyanobacter-
ial mats growing at the northern limit of the terrestrial High Arctic,
and to evaluate the hypothesis that these communities have a high
tolerance to the osmotic stresses that may be increasingly common
in the future. We determined the oxygen and pH gradients in mat
samples by way of microsensor proﬁling in two successive years
of sampling. We partitioned the mats into their component layers
distinguishable by color, and examined the molecular phylogeny
(by 16S rRNA gene analysis) and pigment composition (by high
performance liquid chromatography, HPLC) of each stratum to
evaluate the vertical structure of these communities that thrive in
the extreme High Arctic environment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STUDY SITE
Sampling took place in July 2010 and 2011 at Ward Hunt Lake
(WHL; 83˚05.297
W), as part of the program“North-
ern Ellesmere Island in the Global Environment” (NEIGE). This
lake is on Ward Hunt Island off the northern coast of Ellesmere
Island in the Canadian High Arctic and within Quttinirpaaq
National Park. The total area is of the lake is 0.37 km2, with a max-
imum recorded depth of 7.5 m. At this extreme latitude, ice covers
the lake for at least 9 months of the year and there are 147 days

PIGMENT ANALYSIS
Within 1 month of collection, samples from the three layers of
the microbial mat destined for pigment analysis were freeze-dried
using a Labconco Freezone 12 (Labconco, Kansas City, USA). Mat
subsamples were then weighed and extracted in the dark by grind-
ing for 2 min followed by two sonication treatments for 30 s each
at 17 W in 4 mL 90% acetone:water (vol/vol). The samples were
then left overnight at −20˚C under an argon gas atmosphere,
and the supernatant recovered after vortexing and centrifugation
(4150 rpm for 15 min at 4˚C). This was ﬁltered through a 0.2-μm
pore size PTFE Acrodisc ﬁlter (PALL Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA) and placed in a 2-mL amber vial with an argon gas atmos-
phere for immediate analysis by HPLC. Each layer of the mat was
extracted three more times to ensure the full recovery of all mate-
rial. Four vials were thus analyzed for each mat sample, and the
results summed.

High performance liquid chromatography analysis was per-
formed using a ProStar HPLC system (Varian, Palo Alto,
CA, USA) with a Symmetry C8 column (3.5 μm pore size,
4.6 mm× 150 mm; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) at
25˚C, with a C8 guard column (5 μm pore size, 3.9 mm× 20 mm;
Waters Corporation). Carotenoids were quantiﬁed by their
absorbance at 450 nm in a Diode Array Detector (350–750 nm)
and chlorophylls were detected by ﬂuorescence (excitation at
400 nm and emission at 650 nm). The HPLC separation method
was as in Zapata et al. (2000). Pigments were identiﬁed based on
retention time and spectral comparisons with standards from DHI
(Water & Environments, Horsholm, Denmark).

MOLECULAR ANALYSIS
Mat samples for DNA analysis were extracted using a modiﬁed salt-
based protocol as in Harding et al. (2011). Cyanobacteria-speciﬁc
primers 27F1 and 809R (Jungblut et al., 2005, 2010) were used
to amplify 16S rRNA gene fragments using the polymerase chain
reactions (PCR) with Phusion® High-Fidelity Polymerase, buffer,
and dNTPs (New England BioLabs, Pickering, ON, Canada) on the
iCyclerTM Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules,
CA, USA). Denaturation was for 30 s at 98˚C, followed by 29 cycles
of 10 s at 98˚C, 30 s at 55˚C, 30 s at 72˚C, and a ﬁnal extension time
of 5 min at 72˚C.

Ampliﬁed PCR products were veriﬁed by gel electrophore-
sis then puriﬁed with a QIAquick PCR Puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen,
Mississauga, ON, Canada). Amplicons were cloned using a Strat-
aClone PCR Cloning Kit (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA). Positive clones were transferred to 96-well plates
containing Luria Bertani medium with 7% glycerol. The target
cloned fragments were ampliﬁed using the vector-speciﬁc primers
M13F and M13R. PCR products were veriﬁed by gel electrophore-
sis and the results visualized using the Bio-Rad Gel Doc imaging
system and Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Her-
cules, CA, USA). For each library 30–50 clones were sequenced
using the vector-speciﬁc T7 universal primer (single read) at the
Centre Hospitalier de l’Université Laval (CHUL, QC, Canada)
using an ABI 3730xl system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA), after puriﬁcation.

A total of 108 high quality sequences were retained and man-
ually checked using the BioEdit program (Hall, 1999 – version

7.0.5.3). Suspect sequences were checked manually to detect
chimeras by separate nBLAST searches of short fragments. The
closest matches for each ribotype based on nBLAST searches
(Altschul et al., 1990) of the nr/nt GenBank database were selected
as reference sequences, additional sequences of cultured species
were also added in an attempt to increase the phylogenetic res-
olution. If the closest match was to an uncultured clone, the
closest isolated strain sequence was retrieved and included in
our phylogenetic analysis. Following our microscopy identiﬁ-
cation (see below) of the morphological genus Dichothrix we
directly sequenced several ﬁlaments from one colony, which were
picked under a stereo microscope. Four samples were ampli-
ﬁed directly using cyanobacterial speciﬁc primers 27F1 and 809R
and sequenced in both directions using the same primers. The
eight separate sequencing reactions yielded the same sequence
(CBS4-C1). The phylogenetic tree was constructed following, ini-
tial alignment with multiple alignment using fast Fourier trans-
form (MAFFT, Katoh and Toh, 2008) on the EMBL-EBI portal
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/), all sequences were then
trimmed to 754 nt and realigned using ﬁrst MAFFT and then
ClustalW2, both provided similar arrangements and Nexus guide
trees with the 16S rRNA gene sequence of E. coli DP170 as the
outgroup. The ﬁnal tree was constructed and bootstrapped (1000
replicates) using the Maximum Likelihood in RAxML program
(Version 7.3.0; Stamatakis, 2006; Stamatakis et al., 2008). The
evolutionary model used was GTR +i+ gamma (Tavaré, 1986).
The sequences are deposited in GenBank (accession numbers
JQ249752–JQ249830).

MICROSCOPY ANALYSIS
The microbial mat samples were preserved with a 10% (ﬁnal con-
centration) glutaraldehyde–paraformaldehyde solution (Lovejoy
et al., 1993) and maintained in the dark at 4˚C until analy-
sis. Samples were dispersed prior to enumeration and diluted in
puriﬁed water (milliQ water, Millipore, Billerica, USA) to be sedi-
mented in 15 mL cylindrical counting chambers (Villeneuve et al.,
2001); and observed by Fluorescence, Nomarski, Utermöhl (FNU)
microscopy (Lovejoy et al., 1993). Samples were examined using
an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope (Olympus Canada, Rich-
mond Hill, ON, Canada) at 200× and 400× magniﬁcation under
UV, green, or blue excitation as well as under bright ﬁeld (Köhler)
illumination.
Another microbial mat sample for taxonomic analysis was kept
frozen at −20˚C without ﬁxatives. This sample was thawed and
dispersed in water prior to examination with an Olympus IX71
inverted microscope at 200× magniﬁcation under visible light.

SALINITY TOLERANCE EXPERIMENT
Twelve 150 mL beakers were ﬁlled with 100 mL of water sampled
from WHL on July 7, 2010, and these lake water samples were then
adjusted to the following conductivities with a NaCl solution: 0.25
(original lake water, no salt addition) 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 30, 100, 150,
−1. NaCl solution was used as sodium
200, 250, and 300 mS cm
and chloride are the most abundant dissolved ions in seawater, and
the marine aerosols that reach this coastal lake. The experiment
was repeated the next year (July 7, 2011) with the same range of

sample of freshly collected microbial mat was placed in each
beaker, and the active ﬂuorescence parameters F 0 (minimum ﬂu-
orescence) and F m (maximum ﬂuorescence) were then measured
over the subsequent 24 h using a PAM 2000 (Walz, Germany).
Photochemical quantum yield [F v/F m = (F m − F 0)/F m] was cal-

culated according to Butler (1978) to assess the physiological state
of the photosynthetic communities within the microbial mats.
The measurements were made placing the ﬂuorescence detector
at a distance of 6 mm from black communities of the surface. In
the 2010 experiment, the mats were also inverted to measure the
response of the bottom community.

RESULTS
MICROSENSOR PROFILES
On July 10, 2010, the lake water at the mat sampling site had
−1, the pH was 7.45, the
a measured conductivity of 250 μS cm
water temperature was 5.2˚C, and the oxygen concentration was
at 107% of saturation. The microbial mat was composed of three
distinct layers: the black layer from the surface to 2.2 mm depth
in 2010 and to 1.5 mm in 2011; the pink layer to 4 mm depth;
and the green layer to the bottom at 5.5 mm in 2010 and 4.8 mm
depth in 2011 (Figure 2). Within the mat, the in situ percentage
of oxygen saturation decreased from 100% at the surface to 56%
within the upper black layer, further decreasing to 19% through
the middle pink layer and to 0% at the bottom of the green layer.
There was a steep gradient within each layer, as indicated by the
high coefﬁcients of variation (Table 1). The pH slightly increased
down the mat proﬁle from 7.45 to 7.52 in the upper black layer,
to 7.80 through the pink layer, and to 7.93 in the bottom green
layer, with peaks in pH at the midpoint of each layer (Figure 2A;
Table 1). The oxygen and pH proﬁles were similar in 2011, but
oxygen did not fall completely to zero at the bottom of the proﬁle
(Figure 2B).

PIGMENT ANALYSES
The major pigments as shown by HPLC analysis were scy-
tonemin and its decomposition product reduced-scytonemin,
4-ketomyxol-2
-methylpentoside (keto-mmp), fucoxanthin, myx-
oxanthin, alloxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, canthaxanthin, echi-
nenone, Chlorophyll a (Chl a), and β-carotene (Table 2). Chl
a concentrations were similar in the pink and black layers, and
increased eightfold in the lower layer, from 55 (pink) to 430 μg Chl
−1 dry weight (green). The black and pink layers had similar
a g
ratios of pigments per unit Chl a, with high ratios of scytonemin,
red-scytonemin, keto-mmp, canthaxanthin, echinenone, and β-
carotene. Canthaxanthin, echinenone, and β-carotene were still
present in the green layer, along with myxoxanthin and zeax-
anthin and trace amounts of reduced-scytonemin, scytonemin,
and keto-mmp. The eukaryotic pigments fucoxanthin, alloxan-
thin, and lutein were also recovered from this bottom layer. The
concentrations of photoprotective carotenoids (echinenone, zeax-
anthin, lutein, and canthaxanthin) and photosynthetic carotenoids
(fucoxanthin and alloxanthin) varied among layers. Myxoxanthin
and β-carotene have more than one role in the cell and were
therefore excluded from this analysis. Photoprotective carotenoids
per unit Chl a were twofold higher in the black and pink layers
relative to the bottom green layer, while the two photosynthetic
carotenoids were only detected in the green layer (Table 2).

MOLECULAR ANALYSIS
A clone library was generated for each layer. We obtained 26, 41,
and 41 high quality sequences for the black, pink, and green layer
respectively for a ﬁnal number of 108 sequences The cyanobacteria
sequences from the three layers were diverse and while several of
the sequences had good matches to cultured species for exam-
ple Snowella spp. and Synechococcus sp. PC7502, the majority
had best matches to other environmental clones, notably those

recovered previously form WHL sequences (Figure 3) reported in
Jungblut et al. (2010). Three environmental clusters accounted for
the majority of the clones and these were named after the origi-
nal WHL sequences (WHL-82, WHL-87, and WHL-69). Nearest
cultured matches to other sequences included Nostoc, Leptolyn-
gbya, Phormidium, Oscillatoria, Chamaesiphon, and Gloeobacter
(Figure 3). Oscillatorian sequences were found in all three layers,
but in different proportions. The black layer sequences were mostly
Nostoc, which accounted for 65% of the sequences. Synechococ-
cus and Leptolyngbya were the second and third most frequent
followed by Pseudanabaena and Gloeobacter. The pink layer was
similar to the black layer with Nostoc accounting for 50% of
sequences, but the second most common sequences were clos-
est to Pseudanabaena with 22%, followed by Gloeobacter, Syne-
chococcus, Phormidium, and Leptolyngbya and Chamaesiphon. The
green layer was quite different with lower representation by Nostoc
(29% of sequences). Snowella sequences accounted for 22% and

Synechococcus for 27% of the sequences, and taxa with sequences
closest to Pseudanabaena, Leptolyngbya, Phormidium, Oscillatoria,
and Gloeobacter were also present in this layer (Figure 4). The
sequence of Dichothrix morphospecies aligned most closely to
Leptolyngbya in the Oscillatoriales.

MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS
Diverse morphospecies were observed within the microbial mat.
In the black and pink layers, heterocystous Dichothrix sp. was
well represented, with its usual associated ﬁne ﬁlaments. Nostoc
sp., mostly in small colonies, were also noted. The pink layer con-
tained various Oscillatoriales of diverse ﬁlament diameters, within
the morpho-genera Lyngbya, Oscillatoria, Phormidium, Pseudan-
abaena, and Leptolyngbya. In the lower green layer, the order
Synechococcales was represented, speciﬁcally, the colonial gen-
era Snowella and Aphanocapsa. Other than cyanobacteria, pennate
diatoms occurred throughout the microbial mat and included the
genera Achnanthes, Caloneis, Cymbella, Denticula, Eunotia, Navic-
ula, and Nitzschia. Nematodes were observed in the green layer.

SALINITY RESPONSES
The initial F v/F m of the microbial mat in 2010 ranged from 0.35
to 0.39. For the upper black layer, the F v/F m values immedi-
ately after the salt amendments deﬁned as T 0 remained above
−1, and fell to less than 0.1 at conductivi-
0.25 up to 150 mS cm
−1 and above. After 8 and 24 h of incubation,
ties of 200 mS cm
−1
high F v/F m values (>0.2) were maintained up to 30 mS cm
(Figure 5A). A similar set of responses was recorded for the green
−1 at T 0
layer, with high F v/F m values (>0.2) up to 100 mS cm
−1 at 8 and 24 h (Figure 5B). This experiment
and to 30 mS cm
was repeated in 2011 for the upper black layer, and the results were
similar to those in 2010. F v/F m values above 0.2 were recorded at
−1 over 4 h. After 2 days of incuba-
conductivities up to 50 mS cm
−1 and
tion, F v/F m values >0.29 were maintained up to 30 mS cm
there was a decline to <0.1 at 50 mS cm

−1 (Figure 5C).

To test the capacity of the photosynthetic communities to
recover from the salinity increase, all mat sections at the end of the
ﬁrst experiment were placed back into lake water with its natural
−1. The mats that had been previously
conductivity of 0.25 mS cm
−1 showed ongo-
exposed to conductivities of less than 50 mS cm
ing F v/F m ratios above 0.2 and values above 0.3 were recorded for
−1. There was some evidence
prior exposures of up to 10 mS cm
of partial recovery in the two most extreme salinities (150 and

DISCUSSION
COMMUNITY COMPOSITION
Cyanobacteria dominated the microbial mats from WHL, as in
many lakes of the polar regions (e.g., Vincent, 2000; Zakhia et al.,
2008). Previous studies on this lake have reported taxa from the
Nostocales, Oscillatoriales, and Synechococcales (Villeneuve et al.,
2001; Bonilla et al., 2005; Jungblut et al., 2010), consistent with our
analyses. Nostoc was found throughout the mat, producing black
globular colonies at the surface. The sequence from ﬁlaments of
the “Dichothrix” sample was found to be within the Oscillato-
riales, rather than the Nostocales as expected. Reliably classiﬁed

Dichothrix species are not as yet represented in GenBank and
further investigation is required to determine if this Dichothrix,
which had heterocysts and therefore is morphologically a hetero-
cystous Nostocales, has afﬁnities to the non-heterocystis Oscilla-
toriales. Alternatively, the thin trichomes that appear on the tips of
Dichothrix colonies may be a separate oscillatorian taxon, which
we ampliﬁed from our single trichome. Deeper within the mat
matrix there were no macroscopic colonies, suggesting a shift
toward the uniseriate, ﬁlamentous form of Nostoc that is often
found in association with Oscillatoria (Potts, 2000). The ability of
Nostoc to ﬁx nitrogen, resist desiccation (Mataloni et al., 2000),
and form UV-screening pigments (see below) would make it well
suited to life at the mat surface in the shallow littoral waters of the
lake. While not observed in the present study, Nostoc also produces
motile hormogones (Broady, 1979), enabling vertical migration to
optimize UV-protection deeper within the mat, light-harvesting
toward the mat surface, and access to nutrient resources in the
mat interior.

In the green layer of the mat, there was an increased pres-
ence of taxa that had their closest 16S rRNA gene sequence
matches to Snowella and Synechococcus. These mostly planktonic
taxa have previously been reported as metaphyton (Komárek
and Komárková-Legnerova, 1992). Synechococcus mats are known
from hot spring environments (Stal, 2000), but have been less
reported from the polar regions.

Gloeobacter-like sequences (WHL-69 cluster, Figure 3) were
found throughout the mat, and have been reported previously
from WHL and a pond mat from Ellesmere Island (Jungblut et al.,
2010). The sequences in the present study also closely match a set
of Gloeobacterales sequences from an epilithic bioﬁlm of a Spanish
high mountain lake (GenBank accession number FR667281 and
associated sequences). The Gloeobacterales lineage is divergent
from other cyanobacteria in a variety of striking ways, including
the absence of thylakoids and unique genes for carotenoid biosyn-
thesis (Tsuchiya et al., 2005). However the GenBank reference
Gloeobacter in culture (strain PCC 7421) is only 93% similar to our
sequences, the Jungblut et al. (2010) sequences, and those from the
Spanish alpine lakes, implying that this phylogenetically unusual
component of the cold biosphere may prove to be a new genus.

Oscillatorian cyanobacteria were found through the mat pro-
ﬁle and are well known from Arctic and Antarctic mats. These
organisms in culture have an ability to acclimate via pigment shifts
to large variations in ambient irradiance including UV radiation
(Quesada and Vincent, 1997). Most are cold-tolerant rather than
psychrophiles (Tang et al., 1997). The oscillatorians recorded here
had close matches to those previously reported in this region of
the High Arctic (Jungblut et al., 2010; Harding et al., 2011) and
included those that remain distance from cultured groups (WHL-
82 clade and WHL-87 clade). Overall our phylogenies highlighted
the poor concordance between morphospecies and 16S rRNA gene
sequences as previously noted by Jungblut et al. (2010) and oth-
ers. The limited morphological repertoire of cyanobacteria likely
contributes to this poor phylogeny and suggests that this group
requires major careful taxonomic revision. The 16S rRNA gene
may also lack resolution at higher taxonomic ranks and additional
genes need to be included in such revisions. However, despite these
shortcomings, at the level of 99–100% similarity many of the

of their nearest environmental matches were to other cold regions
as earlier reported by Jungblut et al. (2010).

PIGMENT COMPOSITION
The HPLC analyses showed clear differences in pigment con-
centration and composition through the mat proﬁle, and this
vertical structure may reﬂect both species differences as well as
physiological differences among the layers (Quesada et al., 1999).
Reduced-scytonemin and scytonemin were major pigments of
the black layer of the microbial mat, and are well known in the
Nostocales. The decrease in scytonemin and reduced-scytonemin
with an increase in keto-mmp was consistent with Pseudanabaena
and other oscillatorians in the pink layer. The photoprotective
carotenoids were in highest concentration, both in absolute terms
and per unit Chl a in the upper two layers where irradiance and
oxygen levels were highest, consistent with their role as quenching
agents of reactive oxygen species.

The pigment signature of the green layer was in accordance with
the appearance of myxoxanthin and zeaxanthin, which are typical
for Synechococcales, and the presence of three pigments that are
characteristic of eukaryotic taxa: fucoxanthin (found in diatoms
and other chrysophytes), alloxanthin (found in cryptophytes), and
lutein (characteristic of green algae). Our observations as well as
previous taxonomic analyses of these mats have observed pen-
nate diatoms, notably Cymbella spp. and Achnanthes spp., as well
as chlorophytes, notably Mougeotia sp. and Zygnema sp. (Vil-
leneuve et al., 2001). Canthaxanthin, echinenone, and β-carotene
are found in all cyanobacteria, and were detected in all three layers,
as expected.

Scytonemin and its reduced derivative (Garcia-Pichel and Cas-
tenholz, 1991) contributed the dominant fraction of the total
pigment content of the mat, collectively accounting for 2% of
the dry weight of the surface community, 0.6% of the pink layer,

and 0.2% of the bottom layer. In cultured organisms, scytone-
min has been recorded up to 5% of dry weight, and can similarly
accumulate to high levels in natural assemblages (Karsten et al.,
1998). This pigment has a broad absorbance maximum that peaks
in the UV-A waveband but that also extends into the UV-B and
PAR wavebands (Proteau et al., 1993). It can absorb up to 90%
of incident radiation (Castenholz and Garcia-Pichel, 2000), and
thereby acts as an effective sunscreen for the entire community.
The Ward Hunt communities therefore seem well protected from
any future increases in UV exposure as a result of stratospheric
ozone depletion or increased duration of ice-free conditions.

OXYGEN AND pH PROFILES
The oxygen content of the mats dropped from 100% saturation,
to 0% at the bottom of the green layer in 2010, and to below
40% in 2011. This implies that the mat consortia have a strong
respiratory demand for oxygen as a result of the bottom layer
phototrophs growing under shaded conditions, as well as the
high concentration of bacterial heterotrophs typically found in
polar microbial mats (e.g., Varin et al., 2010). It may also reﬂect
the strong oxygen sink conditions immediately beneath the mats,
where heterotrophic bacteria would dominate. The low photosyn-
thesis/respiration (P/R) balance is likely to extend upward through
the mat later in the season when the lake becomes covered by
ice and snow and the day length shortens, eventually to contin-
uous winter darkness. In shallow Antarctic ponds, the bottom
waters become anoxic during winter-freeze-up, and the mats expe-
rience continuous reducing conditions through much of the year
(Schmidt et al., 1991). Similar conditions are likely to prevail in
WHL during late Arctic autumn and winter.

The pH proﬁles of the Ward Hunt mats showed an increase
with depth, contrary to the decreasing P/R ratios down the pro-
ﬁle as inferred from the oxygen data. However the shifts were
relatively small, in accordance with the high dissolved inorganic

et al., 2001). The pH peaks in each layer might reﬂect a depth opti-
mum for oxygenic photosynthesis in each community, with the
equivalent peak in oxygen obliterated by its rapid diffusive ﬂux
downward as a result of the strong vertical gradient in concentra-
tion. Although rare, 16S rRNA gene sequences of green sulfur bac-
teria have been recorded from these microbial mats (Lionard and
Lovejoy, unpublished data). However, no marker pigments (bacte-
riochlorophylls) for photosynthetic sulfur bacteria were detected
in the HPLC analyses, implying that any anoxygenic photosynthe-
sis was likely minimal. The pH values throughout the mat were
within the neutral to alkaline range in which cyanobacteria are
commonly found (Castenholz, 2009).

SALINITY TOLERANCE
The Ward Hunt mats tolerated increased salinity up to a con-
−1, 46 times ambient salinities of the lake
ductivity of 10 mS cm
water, with little change in photophysiological state as measured
by the active ﬂuorescence parameter F v/F m. For the mats previ-
ously exposed to high salinities and then placed in freshwater, this
quantum yield ratio returned within hours to the range 0.35–0.39,
indicative of excellent physiological conditions for Nostoc (Bowker
et al., 2002). The mucilaginous, exopolysaccharide sheath envelop-
ing Nostoc colonies, is known to provide a buffer from external
variations in salinity (Webb et al., 2003; Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004).
However, salinity tolerance varies widely among cyanobacteria,
which range from species of relatively narrow tolerance (Stal and
Krumbein, 1985) to euryhaline species (Nübel et al., 1999). The
broad tolerances measured here for both the surface and bottom
communities imply that cyanobacteria species in the mats con-
tinue to be metabolically active despite large and rapid ﬂuctuations
in salinity, effectively increasing the range of environmental con-
ditions where active photosynthesis can occur, with implications
for the energy budget within the microbial mats. These results
are consistent with measurements of photosynthesis by microbial
mats from Arctic (Mueller et al., 2005) and Antarctic ice shelves
(Hawes et al., 1992); and Antarctic lakes (Sabbe et al., 2004), which
have shown acclimation to greatly increased salinities.

CONCLUSION
The cyanobacterial mats of WHL were suited to resist the major
ﬂuctuations in environmental conditions that occur at present
in the High Arctic. The layered community structure, with UV-
screening pigments and photoprotective carotenoids at the surface,
allows a more diverse community including eukaryotes to grow
in the bottom green communities of the mats. These bottom
communities must contend with low oxygen tensions in sum-
mer, and the entire mat community is likely to experience anoxia
during winter-freeze-up. The salinity responses measured here
indicate broad tolerances and no loss of photosynthetic func-
tion under high and ﬂuctuating osmolarities. Previous work on
polar microbial mats has shown their tolerance of desiccation
(Hawes et al., 1992), and that cyanobacterial isolates from Arc-
tic and Antarctic mats grow faster at temperatures that are well
above the present day ambient conditions (Tang et al., 1997). In
combination, these results imply that cyanobacterial communi-
ties will continue to dominate polar aquatic ecosystems despite
ongoing variations in water balance, increased UV radiation, and

prolongation of ice-free conditions. However, these slow-growing
mat communities currently experience little grazing pressure, and
their persistence may be less assured if the northward expansion
of invasive species accompanying climate change (Vincent et al.,
2011 and references therein) includes arthropod grazers that feed
on these large stocks of benthic microbial biomass.
