Aptamers generated from randomized libraries of nucleic acids have found utility in a wide
variety of ﬁelds and in the clinic. Aptamers can be used to target both intracellular and extra-
cellular components, including small molecules, proteins, cells, and viruses. With recent
technological developments in stringent selection and rapid isolation strategies, it is likely
that aptamers will continue to make an impact as useful tools and reagents. Although many
recently developed aptamers are intended for use as therapeutic and diagnostic agents,
use of aptamers for basic research, including target validation, remains an active area with
high potential to impact our understanding of molecular mechanisms and for drug discov-
ery. In this brief review, we will discuss recent aptamer discoveries, their potential role in
structural virology, as well as challenges and future prospects.

Keywords: aptamer, therapeutic and diagnostic agents, structural virology, research tools

INTRODUCTION
Aptamers are in vitro selected nucleic acid molecules that bind
to a broad range of targets with high afﬁnity and speciﬁcity. The
basic isolation process, termed “systematic evolution of ligands
by exponential enrichment” or SELEX (Ellington and Szostak,
1990; Robertson and Joyce, 1990; Tuerk and Gold, 1990), uti-
lizes a large initial pool of randomized nucleic acids from which
high afﬁnity binders are isolated and enriched through subsequent
rounds of selection (Figure 1). Different in vitro isolation strate-
gies can be used to generate aptamers against many diverse targets
under different selection and counter selection conditions, lead-
ing to facile identiﬁcation of aptamers that bind targets ranging
from a few atoms (small molecules) to many atoms (macromol-
ecules) to intact cells and viruses. Most aptamers characterized
to date are single stranded DNA or RNA molecules ranging
from 20 to 90 bases, although longer aptamers have been gen-
erated. These single stranded polynucleotide sequences can fold
into a variety of secondary structural elements, including dou-
ble stranded RNA (dsRNA) or dsDNA, stem loops, pseudoknots,
kinks, and bulges, providing multiple recognition surfaces for
target binding.

Aptamers are often compared to antibodies, due to the high
speciﬁcity for their targets generated through stringent in vitro
selection. However, aptamers have notable advantages over anti-
bodies, including low immunogenicity and the potential for chem-
ical derivatization to enhance in vivo stability and bioavailability
(Jellinek et al., 1995; Chelliserrykattil and Ellington, 2004; Kato
et al., 2005). The aptamer selection process can be carried out
in as little as 2–4 weeks, which is signiﬁcantly shorter compared
to antibody development (months). Since the initial description
of the SELEX process over two decades ago, general principles
guiding the selection process have remained largely unaltered.
However, modiﬁcations to the original process now allow for
highly efﬁcient and extremely stringent selection strategies to be

employed against a diverse array of targets. Identiﬁed aptamers
can be further optimized using biased libraries that result in
aptamer subpopulations with higher speciﬁcity and/or afﬁnity and
other desirable characteristics, such as membrane permeability.
Coupling SELEX methods with other techniques, such as capil-
lary electrophoresis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), can
reduce the number of selection rounds and shorten the period
for aptamer discovery against a given target. In addition, facile
generation of modiﬁed aptamers allows for coupling of diagnos-
tic tags, which can extend the use of aptamers through prolonged
lifetimes in serum. Given the traditional comparisons with anti-
bodies, the utility of aptamers in the clinic is taking longer than
anticipated from the outset of discovery. Nonetheless, with the
2004 FDA approval of pegaptanib, an aptamer-based drug used
to treat wet age-related muscular degeneration, and others in the
pipeline, it is clear that aptamers will continue to contribute to
our understanding of normal and aberrant cellular processes as
well as disease treatment. Recent comprehensive reviews highlight
advances in basic research (James, 2001, 2007; Syed and Pervaiz,
2010; Sun et al., 2011) and clinical settings (Bunka and Stockley,
2006; Gopinath, 2007, 2008; Meyer et al., 2011). These develop-
ments have positioned aptamers to make a signiﬁcant impact in
many areas.

APTAMERS AND VIRUSES
The host–viral interface has become an increasingly popular tar-
get for aptamers because interactions between nucleic acids and
proteins are critical to viral replication (Figure 2). Although not a
prerequisite, targeting nucleic acid binding proteins by aptamers
has a high probability of success due to the presence of basic surface
charges on most nucleic acid binding proteins. Below we summa-
rize select studies in order to highlight the use of aptamers against
viral components and discuss challenges and future prospects of
the ﬁeld.

APTAMERS IN THERAPEUTICS
Aptamers provide an alternative method for the development of
therapeutic agents to counter viral infections. Aptamers can be
used to inhibit viral infectivity at any stage in the viral repli-
cation cycle, including viral entry, which has the potential to
prevent initial infection. The development of aptamers against the
human immunodeﬁciency virus HIV-1 has been of interest for
drug discovery. In order to target HIV entry into helper T-cells,

aptamers generated against HIV glycoprotein 120 (gp120) com-
petes with the HIV co-receptor, CCR5. The aptamer binding site
is located in a highly conserved region of gp120, allowing neu-
tralization of a broad range of HIV isolates by disrupting the
gp120–CCR5 interaction (Dey et al., 2005a,b). Binding to a con-
served region of gp120 is critical due to the propensity of HIV
to undergo mutagenesis that results in drug-resistance. The anti-
gp120 aptamer has not been approved for clinical trials, but has

been used as a basis for developing chimeric aptamers (Neff et al.,
2011; Wheeler et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011). Coupling of siRNA
and the anti-gp120 aptamer through phi29 packaging RNA com-
bines two functions (Zhou et al., 2011). The anti-gp120 aptamer
has an inhibitory effect, while siRNA downregulates the expression
of its target.

Aptamer generation against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)
particles was carried out without prior information on speciﬁc tar-
gets (Wang et al., 2000). Two aptamers, L13 and L19, were isolated
that inhibit HCMV plaque formation and growth. The antiviral
activity of L13 and L19 aptamers identiﬁed HCMV glycoproteins
B and H as targets, respectively, by binding to the glycoproteins
and blocking viral entry.

Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases have been a common
target because viral polymerases use RNA as the template dur-
ing genome replication. For example, the hepatitis C virus (HCV)
polymerase non-structural protein 5B (NS5B), is required for tran-
scribing the HCV genome and has been used to generate both
anti-NS5B RNA and DNA aptamers (Biroccio et al., 2002; Belle-
cave et al., 2003, 2008). Both sets of aptamers have been shown to
bind to NS5B with high afﬁnity and inhibit polymerase activity.
The mechanism of inhibition of the anti-NS5B RNA aptamer is
non-competitive with regards to the template RNA, and mutagen-
esis studies revealed that a basic patch within the thumb domain of
NS5B is the aptamer binding site (Biroccio et al., 2002). Only one
anti-NS5B DNA aptamer inhibits replication by competing with
the RNA template; the other inhibits through a non-competitive
mechanism in which initiation and post initiation events are dis-
rupted. RNA aptamers capable of inhibiting NS5B polymerase
activity were further optimized through the use of deletion clones
and point mutagenesis, which identiﬁed a GC-rich motif and a
stem-loop with a bulge as important features for aptamer binding
to NS5B (Kanamori et al., 2009).

In the context of HIV pathogenesis, viral reverse transcriptase
(RT) converts the single stranded RNA (ssRNA) viral genome into
dsDNA. RNA aptamers that target HIV-RT effectively inhibit the
synthesis of cDNA (Tuerk et al., 1992). The ligand 1.1 aptamer
targeting HIV-RT is postulated to reduce adverse side effects, a
(cid:2)
main concern with current HIV-RT drugs, such as 3
-azido-3
-
deoxythymidine (AZT) and dideoxyinosine. Moreover, by target-
ing an enzyme early in the HIV-1 replication cycle, the likeli-
hood that mutations will arise resulting in drug-resistance should
diminish. These factors make aptamers generated against HIV-RT
promising candidates for drug development.

(cid:2)

Inhibition of protein translation is a key host defense mecha-
nism against viral infections since viruses are completely depen-
dent on the host machinery for protein synthesis. However,
viruses have developed various means to evade host defenses and
hijack the host translational machinery. For example, the HCV
mRNA has an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a structured
region within the mRNA that binds the ribosome and initiates
cap-independent translation, allowing HCV to circumvent the
requirement for host initiation and elongation factors. Aptamers
targeting the HCV IRES inhibit IRES-dependent translation of
HCV proteins (Aldaz-Carroll et al., 2002; Kikuchi et al., 2003,
2005; Da Rocha Gomes et al., 2004). Furthermore, many of these
HCV IRES aptamers inhibit translation both in vitro and in vivo,

highlighting the potential therapeutic value of these aptamers
since they target RNA secondary structure that is characteris-
tic of select viral mRNAs but not host mRNA. Therefore, such
selection may result in a reduction of negative side effects. The
viral inhibitory properties of HCV anti-IRES aptamers can be
enhanced through conjugation to other aptamers, which target
different binding sites within the HCV IRES. This results in a con-
jugated anti-IRES aptamer that binds the HCV IRES with a higher
afﬁnity and is functionally more effective than the unconjugated
aptamers (Kikuchi et al., 2009). Alternatively, HCV anti-IRES
aptamers can be coupled to the hammerhead ribozyme to pre-
vent translation. The chimeric RNA molecule, HH363-50, inhibits
IRES-dependent translation in vitro likely through disruption
of 80S complex formation with no effect on IRES-independent
translation. HH363-50 also reduced the level of HCV RNA due
to the ribozyme activity of the molecule (Romero-Lopez et al.,
2009).

APTAMERS IN VIRAL DIAGNOSTICS
Early and reliable detection of pathogens is a critical step in the
successful treatment of infection. Due to many potential advan-
tages aptamers provide, aptamers are also ideal tools for diag-
nostics. Many examples of aptamers as a detection tool have
been described. These studies include simple modiﬁcations to the
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as well as more
complex diagnostic systems, such as those that use inhibitory
aptamers to suppress multi turnover enzymes (Zhou et al., 2010).
The Inﬂuenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase
(NA) antigens are glycoproteins found on the surface of the viral
particle, and serve important roles in host membrane fusion.
A number of aptamers have been isolated against Inﬂuenza A
HA that inhibit viral infectivity (Jeon et al., 2004; Misono and
Kumar, 2005; Gopinath et al., 2006; Dhar and Datta, 2009; Park
et al., 2011). In addition to disrupting viral HA-mediated mem-
brane fusion, the P30-10-16 aptamer can distinguish between
closely related Inﬂuenza A strains. This aptamer property is novel,
considering that most monoclonal antibodies against HA have
been unsuccessful at differentiating among inﬂuenza subtypes.
Although initial studies were carried out by SPR-based detection,
coupling of these aptamers to ﬂuorophores or other signaling mol-
ecules could provide facile detection of virus subtypes. Develop-
ment of these aptamers for viral subtype diagnostics will provide a
signiﬁcant advancement in our ability to differentiate highly path-
ogenic inﬂuenza strains from those that are less virulent and will
likely yield important insights into its mechanism of action.

The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) is found
on the membrane of HBV-infected hepatocytes. A ﬂuorescently
labeled aptamer targeting HBsAg, HBs-A22, was used to isolate
cells expressing HBsAg. Use of ﬂuorescence microscopy showed
that that anti-HBsAg aptamer bound to the HBsAg-positive
cell line (HepG2.2.15) but not to the HBsAg-negative cell line
(HepG2). These results establish the use of aptamers for imaging,
but also provide the ﬁrst HBV speciﬁc antigen aptamer that could
be used for early detection and treatment of HBV-infected cells
(Liu et al., 2010).

Aptamers can also function as diagnostic tools when coupled
to existing biosensors (Davis et al., 1998; Jhaveri et al., 2000;

www.frontiersin.org

Binning et al.

Aptamers in virology

Fang et al., 2001; O’Sullivan, 2002). Biosensors utilize a biological
recognition element, such as aptamers, and a transducer for eas-
ier detection and quantiﬁcation. An aptamer-based biosensor, or
aptasensor, was isolated against the trans-activator of transcrip-
tion (Tat) of HIV-1, which is important for regulating the early
phases of HIV-1 infection (Chang et al., 1997; Mucha et al., 2002).
The Tat aptasensor was generated by immobilizing the aptamer on
a piezoelectric quartz-crystal, the transduction component of the
aptasensor. Comparison of the Tat aptasensor to a corresponding
immunosensor that uses an anti-Tat monoclonal antibody showed
that the two biosensors are similar in terms of sensitivity and
reproducibility (Minunni et al., 2004).

A multicomponent reporter system consisting of an inhibitory
aptamer bound to a restriction endonuclease and a target com-
plement/trigger system was successful in differentiating Dengue
virus serotypes (Fletcher et al., 2010). One of the key advantages
of this method is that the same aptamer/enzyme complex can be
used since only the nucleic acid complement/trigger needs modi-
ﬁcation to detect new targets. Such a system can be more sensitive
due to the multi-turnover nature of the endonuclease. Further
development of these aptasensors and incorporating more stable
chemical derivatives will likely overcome some of the limitations
of current aptasensors.

APTAMERS IN BASIC RESEARCH
In addition to diagnostic and therapeutic applications, aptamers
can be used as laboratory reagents in a number of biochemical
and cell-based assays, similar to antibodies. Aptamers have key
advantages over antibodies in that they often have higher afﬁn-
ity and speciﬁcity for their targets with some binding constants
(K D) < 1 nM, which results in an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio.
Additionally, aptamers can be generated against almost any target
ranging from small organic molecules to proteins to whole cells
(Jayasena, 1999), and they are often times smaller than antibod-
ies (7–30 kDa for aptamers vs. ∼150 kDa for antibodies) allowing
them to bind regions inaccessible to antibodies.

By utilizing aptamers that disrupt protein–protein interactions,
one can begin to dissect and characterize cellular pathways. The
human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein is a trans-activator
that regulates the expression of various viral and cellular genes.
Tax cannot directly bind DNA in the absence of certain host tran-
scription factors, suggesting that protein–protein interactions are
essential for Tax function. The YT1 aptamer disrupts Tax inter-
actions with the cyclic AMP-response element binding protein
(CREB) and NF-κB, but not serum response factor (SRF), all of
which are known to interact with Tax proteins (Tian et al., 1995).
These results suggest that the CREB and NF-κB binding interfaces
on Tax may potentially overlap or are in close proximity, whereas
the SRF binding site occupies a different surface on Tax. There-
fore, aptamers provide a potential tool to map interaction surfaces
between binding partners.

Assembly of the viral nucleocapsid (NC) requires multiple
protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interactions. The HIV
NC is a highly conserved protein that plays a key role in RNA
encapsidation and viral replication, and speciﬁcally binds viral
genomic RNA through the psi sequence. An aptamer generated
against NC competes with the psi sequence and prevents proper

encapsidation of the viral genome, which likely inhibits proper
packaging of the genomic RNA (Kim et al., 2002). Other HIV-
1 NC aptamers against the HIV-1 Gag protein bind the matrix
and the NC domains of Gag and reduced HIV replication in cul-
tured cells. The inhibitory effect of these aptamers was not due to
a defect in virion release but the downregulation of intracellular
Gag protein and mRNA. A subset of aptamers which speciﬁcally
bound NC competes with the psi packing signal of HIV-1, and
disrupts interactions between Gag and viral RNA (Ramalingam
et al., 2011). Unlike other aptamers that inhibit early stages in
viral infection, the NC aptamer targets events that occur after viral
entry, and therefore, allows one to study the intracellular effects of
viral infection.

Using aptamers to speciﬁcally target and modulate functions
of proteins within cellular pathways or the viral replication cycle
can provide invaluable information about these respective systems.
Nonetheless, an additional advantage of using aptamers to investi-
gate cellular signaling is the ability to selectively turn the aptamers
“on” and “off ” with effectors. Further advances in the spatial and
temporal regulation of aptamers will be important for enhanc-
ing our understanding of viral/host interactions. The potential
regulation of aptamers with effector molecules is highlighted by
Vuyisich and Beal (2002) in the regulation of formamidopyrimi-
dine glycosylase (Fpg), a bacterial enzyme involved in DNA repair.
A modiﬁed SELEX protocol was used where RNA-bound Fpg was
treated with neomycin in order to elute the bound RNA. The Fpg
aptamer inhibited Fpg activity, but the functionality was restored
in the presence of neomycin. Rusconi et al. (2002) utilized anti-
sense RNA in order to regulate the function of an aptamer targeted
against the blood coagulation factor IXa. The anti-sense RNA base
pairs to complementary regions within the aptamer and disrupts
aptamer function. The factor IXa aptamer and anti-sense RNA
antidote pair was an effective, reversible anticoagulant and shows
potential for clinical application.

FUTURE PROSPECTS
Many viral proteins bind nucleic acids, although not a required
characteristic, makes viruses good targets for aptamer develop-
ment. As outlined above, aptamers have been used in a vari-
ety of studies to characterize and counter host–viral interac-
tions, including targeting individual viral components or whole
cells. A signiﬁcant advantage of the aptamer technology lies
in its ability to identify aptamers against a given target with-
out a priori knowledge of the exact site or target. With lim-
ited information on the binding site, aptamers can be gener-
ated toward a given target and subsequently tested for regula-
tory activity either in vitro or in vivo. Similarly, aptamers can
be used in target validation, where judicious use of aptamers
can provide distinct advantages. Aptamers can also be used to
dissect protein–protein interfaces and to validate traditional tar-
gets for small molecules, such as enzyme active sites. Current
selection of small molecules toward known targets often depend
on a variety of factors, including the availability of validating
functional assays, structural and biochemical data, prior to ini-
tiating drug discovery efforts, which consume large amounts
of time and resources. In contrast, one can develop aptamers
with a fraction of the cost and time in a laboratory setting.

Aptamers in virology

It is interesting to note that most aptamers form unusual and
dynamic conformations that can potentially allow aptamers to
target protein–protein, protein–nucleic acid, and small molecule
interactions. However, in many of the examples reviewed, there is
limited knowledge on the structural and biochemical aspects of
these aptamer/target interactions, and available data are primar-
ily restricted to secondary structure predictions or mapping. The
addition of structural and biochemical studies of aptamer/target
pairs can enhance the utility of these aptamers by providing new
information on the aptamer/target interfaces and by providing

information for structure-based optimization of aptamers. Con-
tinual development and optimization of multifunctional, chimeric
aptamers, and aptamer libraries for strain speciﬁc viral iden-
tiﬁcation will lead to more broadly applicable therapeutic and
diagnostic applications in the future.
