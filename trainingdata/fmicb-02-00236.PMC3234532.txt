Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. ap), the causative agent of Johne’s
disease, infects many farmed ruminants, wild-life animals, and recently isolated from
humans. To better understand the molecular pathogenesis of these infections, we ana-
lyzed the whole-genome sequences of several M. ap and M. avium subspecies avium (M.
avium) isolates to gain insights into genomic diversity associated with variable hosts and
environments. Using Next-generation sequencing technology, all six M. ap isolates showed
a high percentage of similarity (98%) to the reference genome sequence of M. ap K-10
isolated from cattle. However, two M. avium isolates (DT 78 and Env 77) showed signiﬁcant
sequence diversity (only 87 and 40% similarity, respectively) compared to the reference
strain M. avium 104, a reﬂection of the wide environmental niches of this group of mycobac-
teria. Within the M. ap isolates, genomic rearrangements (insertions/deletions) were not
detected, and only unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed among
M. ap isolates. While more of the SNPs (∼100) in M. ap genomes were non-synonymous,
a total of ∼6,000 SNPs were detected among M. avium genomes, most of them were
synonymous suggesting a differential selective pressure between M. ap and M. avium
isolates. In addition, SNPs-based phylo-genomics had a enough discriminatory power to
differentiate between isolates from different hosts but yet suggesting a bovine source of
infection to other animals examined in this study. Interestingly, the human isolate (M. ap
4B) was closely related to a M. ap isolate from a dairy facility, suggesting a common source
of infection. Overall, the identiﬁed phylo-genomes further supported the idea of a common
ancestor to both M. ap and M. avium isolates. Genome-wide analysis described here could
provide a strong foundation for a population genetic structure that could be useful for the
analysis of mycobacterial evolution and for the tracking of Johne’s disease transmission
among animals.

INTRODUCTION
Infection with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis
(M. ap) causes Johne’s disease, or paratuberculosis, in a large num-
ber of ruminants and wild-life animals (Collins et al., 1994b). The
combination of low milk yield and mortalities caused by Johne’s
disease signiﬁcantly impacts the economics of the dairy industry in
the US and worldwide (Barrett et al., 2006; Raizman et al., 2009).
Both infected and clinically ill animals can shed M. ap in their
feces, a common source of infection, especially to young calves
through a fecal–oral route (Collins et al., 1994a). The infected ani-
mals usually have a prolonged subclinical phase which eventually
leads to severe gastroenteritis and death. The disease affects mainly
ruminants with some evidence suggesting an association between
M. ap and Crohn’s disease in humans (Naser et al., 2002, 2004;
Over et al., 2011). As expected, M. ap isolates from variable hosts
were the subject of several genetic analyses to decipher a potential
role for genetic variations on M. ap virulence and pathogenesis.

For example, approaches based on PCR ampliﬁcation of speciﬁc
targets (e.g., IS1311, IS900; Whittington et al., 2000) and short
sequence repeats (SSR; Sevilla et al., 2008) revealed isolate varia-
tion on a genetic level. Recently, DNA microarrays were applied
to examine variations on a whole-genome level (Paustian et al.,
2005; Wu et al., 2006) which provided a comprehensive analy-
sis of large scale differences among examined isolates. However,
events of genomic rearrangements (insertions/deletions, Indels)
were not easily identiﬁed. In this report, we resorted to a high
throughput sequencing strategy to address our hypothesis linking
genomic diversity to mycobacterial adaption to variable host and
environments where they replicate and persist.

Several studies attempted to examine the genomic polymor-
phisms among M. avium complex (MAC) strains to better identify
mycobacterial species associated with infections. In one study,
dnaJ sequence revealed a limited genomic diversity among human
and veterinary strains (Morita et al., 2004). However, comparative

Genomic diversity among M. ap isolates

genomic hybridization revealed more diversity among M. avium,
M. ap, and M. avium subsp. silvaticum (Semret et al., 2004; Paus-
tian et al., 2005). Despite a 95% similarity at the nucleotide level
between M. avium and M. ap, long oligonucleotide microarrays
were able to assess genomic diversity among the genomes of MAC
members (Semret et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2006). Fortunately, the
complete genome sequence of M. ap K-10 was reported in 2005
and has been revised and re-sequenced recently (Li et al., 2005; Wu
et al., 2009; Wynne et al., 2010) which allowed more detailed com-
parative analysis of several M. ap strains. For the M. tuberculosis
complex, the presence of historical data and documented isolates
collection helped in better understanding of the origin and evolu-
tion of members of this group (Behr and Small, 1999; Smith et al.,
2009). Unfortunately, such records are not available for members
of MAC.

With the advancements in next-generation sequencing tech-
nology (Bentley et al., 2008), we took advantage of Illumina-based
technology to decipher the genome contents of M. ap isolates from
various animals and their environments. This technology allows
us to compare genomic sequences on unprecedented level, the
nucleotide level, with high speed and accuracy. With the help of an
array of bioinformatics tools, we were able to analyze the genomes
of eight mycobacterial isolates including the ATCC 19698, a widely
used M. ap isolate in several virulence and pathogenesis stud-
ies (Tanaka et al., 1994; Shin et al., 2006; Van et al., 2010). Most
M. ap isolates had a high level of sequence similarity to the ref-
erence, M. ap K-10 strain on a genome-wide scale even when
human isolates were analyzed (Wynne et al., 2011). However, the
genomes of two M. avium isolates had lower level of sequence
identity to the M. avium 104 genome, the reference genome for M.
avium subsp. hominissuis (MAH). Overall, genomic rearrange-
ments represented by large scale inversions and deletions were
found between M. ap and M. avium genomes. However, single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were the most common varia-
tions observed among M. ap isolates from different animals despite
the bovine origin for all of these isolates. The observed genomic
polymorphism among MAC isolates provided us a better under-
standing for the evolutionary forces active on both closely related
organisms with different characteristic phenotypes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
BACTERIAL STRAINS
Six strains of M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. ap) from
different hosts and environments and two M. avium subspecies

avium (M. avium) were selected (Table 1) for whole-genome
sequencing. Laboratory strain of M. ap ATCC 19698, JTC 1281,
JTC 1285, and DT 3 were all obtained from Johne’s testing cen-
ter (JTC) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. M. ap 4B, a
human isolate, was provided by Dr. Saleh Naser at the Univer-
sity of Central Florida (Wu et al., 2006). Environmental isolates
were obtained from the soil and utensils of dairy farms and pro-
vided by National Veterinary Service Laboratories at Ames, IA. The
identity of each strain was conﬁrmed and genotyped as M. ap ver-
sus M. avium by PCR analysis of three genes (16S rRNA, IS1311,
hsp65) and growth phenotype in presence/absence of mycobactin
J as outlined before (Wu et al., 2006). Each strain was cultured
in Middlebrook 7H9 broth media supplemented with 10% ADC
(2% glucose, 5% bovine serum albumin factor V, and 0.85% NaCl),
0.05% Tween 80 at 37˚C. For M. ap isolates, 2 μg/ml of Mycobactin
J was added.

GENOMIC DNA EXTRACTION
Five to 10 ml of bacterial cultures at mid-log phase were used for
DNA extraction and isolation. Brieﬂy, M. ap cultures were cen-
trifuged down at 10,000 rpm for 3 min and pellets were then resus-
pended in sterile Tris–EDTA buffer. Bacterial cells were killed at
80˚C for 20 min before adding lysozyme (10 μl of 100 mg/ml) for
an overnight incubation at 37˚C. After cell lysis, 12 μl of 20 mg/ml
proteinase K/pellet was added and incubated at 65˚C for 2–3 h. For
DNA isolation, 100 μl of 5 M NaCl/pellet was added and incubated
at 65˚C for 10 min, followed by adding 80 μl of CTAB/NaCl and
then incubated for another 10 min at 65˚C. In addition, equal vol-
ume of phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was added
to each tube and centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at room tem-
perature. The aqueous upper layers were collected and transferred
to a fresh tube for washing with equal volume of chloroform–
isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and then with isopropanol followed by
incubation at −20˚C for at least 1 h. Genomic DNA was pre-
cipitated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min followed by
washing in 75% ethanol. After wash, DNA pellets were dried in a
Speed-Vac and resuspended in nuclease-free sterile water.

WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING
Puriﬁed genomic DNA (1–5 μg) samples isolated from each target
strain were sent to the Genomic Resource Center (GRC) at the Uni-
versity of Maryland for Illumina GAIIx whole-genome sequencing
with multiplexing using the sample preparation oligonucleotide
kit from Illumina. The integrity and concentration of DNA was

checked by GRC again and followed by fragmentation of DNA
using nebulization. DNA ends were repaired and A-tails and adap-
tors were added using Illumina protocols. The desired size of DNA
(around 200 bp) were selected and then ampliﬁed with adaptor
speciﬁc primers that contained four nucleotide barcode tags. The
ampliﬁed DNA libraries were analyzed by Agilent Bioanalyzer to
determine the size and the concentration of DNA fragments. DNA
libraries were loaded onto eight channel ﬂow cell. DNA fragments
were denatured and hybridized to the oligonucleotides in ﬂow
cells followed by and ampliﬁcation step to form clusters. The ﬂow
cells were then transferred to Genome analyzer II for sequencing.
For paired-end sequence reads, the amplicons were ﬂipped on the
ﬂowcells so the other end can be read as described before (Quail
et al., 2008). At the end of each run, four images were collected
and used for base-calling.

SEQUENCE ASSEMBLY AND ALIGNMENTS
Raw sequences obtained from the Illumina GAIIx were analyzed
using the CLC Genomic Workbench software (version 4.0.3, CLC
Bio, Cambridge, MA, USA) to perform both de novo and com-
parative reference assembly. For the M. ap genomes, all sequences
were assembled in reference to the revised M. ap K-10 sequences
(Wynne et al., 2010). The M. avium DT 78 genome was assem-
bled using the genome of M. avium subsp. hominissuis 104 (NCBI
accession NC 008595) as a reference. The de novo assembly was
used for the genome sequence of Env 77 strain because of the
lack of signiﬁcant similarity to other genomes. Additionally, the
MAUVE algorithm was used to align paired or multiple genomes
for comparative purposes, as outlined before (Perna et al., 1998;
Darling et al., 2010). The gapped consensus sequence of each strain
was imported to MAUVE for sequence alignment at default seed
weight setting.

SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS ANALYSIS
For SNPs detection, we used algorithms implemented in CLC
Bio Workstation. Criteria for identifying SNPs included a cov-
erage range setting at 10–55 reads and a presence frequency in
at least 50% of the reads before consideration for further analy-
sis. A randomly selected number of SNPs were further analyzed
using Sanger sequencing to conﬁrm Next-Generation sequencing
data. The primers were designed to cover 10 possible SNPs. The
BigDye Terminator (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit was used for sequencing. The
sequencing PCR included an initial denaturation cycle at 95˚C
for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 95˚C for 20 s, 45˚C for 30 s
and 60˚C for 2 min with a ﬁnal extension at 72˚C for 7 min. All
samples were sent to the Biotechnology Center at the University
of Wisconsin–Madison for sequencing on a ABI 3730XL machine
(Applied Biosystems).

For the genome-wide phylogeny (phylo-genome analysis), the
predicted SNPs from sequenced genomes (M. ap isolates) and the
corresponding nucleotides in DT 78, M. ap K-10 and M. avium 104
were tabulated to create a concatenated sequences of each strain.
The genome of M. avium Env 77 isolate was excluded from such
analysis because of the low similarity to other genomes. The con-
catenated sequence of each strain was aligned using CLUSTALW,
and phylogenetic trees were generated with MEGA version 5

using one of the following methods: maximum parsimony (MP),
maximum likelihood (ML), maximum likelihood with molecular
clock (MLK) assumption in addition to Neighbor-joining algo-
rithm with a bootstrapping values of 1,000 replicates applied to all
methods (Tamura et al., 2011).

RESULTS
CHARACTERIZATION OF MYCOBACTERIAL ISOLATES
Several mycobacterial species belonging to the M. avium com-
plex are present in animal surroundings; each with different
capacities to cause illness (e.g., M. ap, M. avium) and poten-
tial to spread to humans (Alvarez-Uria, 2010). Before initiating
our genome analysis of members of the M. avium complex, we
searched our collection of mycobacterial isolates originating from
diverse hosts, diverse tissues as well as from environmental sam-
ples of dairy herds that might help in spreading the infection. Our
selection scheme identiﬁed eight isolates that were subjected for
further genotyping protocols to conﬁrm their identity. Based on
acid-fast staining and ampliﬁcation of the 16S rRNA gene using
mycobacteria-speciﬁc primers (Talaat et al., 1997), all eight isolates
were shown to belong to the genus mycobacterium. Moreover, typ-
ing based on the hsp65 gene (Smole et al., 2002) conﬁrmed the
identity of two mycobacterial isolates, DT 78 and Env 77 as M.
avium subspecies avium (M. avium) while the rest of the isolates
were all M. ap. Identiﬁcation of sheep or cattle types of M. ap was
based on IS1311 ampliﬁcation followed by HinfI digestion (data
not shown). All of the six M. ap isolates belonged to the bovine
origin (M. ap type II). A compiled list of all mycobacterial isolates
used in this study and their origin is shown in Table 1.

WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING OF MYCOBACTERIAL ISOLATES
The Illumina sequencer generated an average read length of 50
nucleotides with an average coverage of 42–68× of each sequenced
genome after reference assembly. The number of reads, mapped
reads, and the length of consensus sequence are all listed in Table 2.
The revised version of M. ap K-10 sequence (Wynne et al., 2010)
and M. avium subspecies hominissuis (M. avium 104) were used as
references for comparative genome assembly of the target isolates.
As expected, all examined M. ap genomes showed a high sequence
identity (up to 99%) to the M. ap K-10 genome. Lack of sequence
coverage in some parts of the genome could explain some of the
differences from the reference genome. Despite the presence of
small deleted regions among M. ap genomes, only 2 gaps >1 kb
had been seen among M. ap genomes, including the one isolated
from human (M. ap 4B isolate), suggesting a high level of simi-
larity to the M. ap K-10 strain isolated from cattle. On the other
hand, the M. avium DT 78 strain had only 87% sequence iden-
tity to the M. avium 104 genome while it had a higher similarity
(93%) to the M. ap K-10 genome, despite its established geno-
type as M. avium isolate. In the DT 78 genome, more gaps were
present whether M. avium 104 or M. ap K-10 were used for ref-
erence alignment (Figure 1). The average gap size in this genome
is ∼4 kb.

Among the sequenced genomes, the genome of M. avium Env
77 provided a signiﬁcant challenge because of the low level of
similarity to M. avium 104 genome during the reference assem-
bly phase. Accordingly, we employed an algorithm for de novo

assembly that generated 772 contigs. These contigs were used as
queries in MegaBLAST search against the Mycobacteria genome
database (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The coverage of each contig is
at least 20× and the average coverage of all contigs is around 30×
for this strain. In fact, the Env 77 genome was sequenced twice with
similar result for each sequencing run (data not shown). Interest-
ingly, BLAST analysis showed only a third of the Env 77 genome
with sequence similarity to the genomes of either the M. ap K-
10 or M. avium 104 and to a lesser degree to other sequenced
mycobacterial genomes, suggesting a mosaic genome structure
(Figure 2). Detailed BLAST analysis of the Env 77 draft genome
shared common conserved genes, mainly with four mycobac-
terium species, including ribosomal proteins, DNA polymerase,
proteinase Clp, cell division protein Fts, and some transcription

or translation regulatory factors. As indicated in Figure 2, the
genome of M. avium Env 77 has higher similarity to M. avium
104 and M. ap K-10 than other mycobacterial species. Overall,
the sequenced genomes from all strains, except Env 77, mapped
to the reference genomes with a signiﬁcantly high level of similar-
ity. All sequenced genomes were deposited to GenBank database
for download and further analysis. The accession numbers for the
deposited sequences are listed in Table A1 in Appendix.

GENOMIC REARRANGEMENTS AMONG M. AP ISOLATES
A major goal of our investigation was to delineate events of
insertions and deletions among mycobacterial genomes to bet-
ter understand their evolutionary relationships. To identify large
scale events of insertions/deletions (Indels), we compared the

Genomic diversity among M. ap isolates

SNPS AMONG M. AP ISOLATES
To better analyze genomic diversity among M. ap isolates, we also
examined genomic variations on the nucleotide level. For SNPs
analysis, we set stringent criteria for SNP detection (see Materi-
als and Methods). The total number of SNPs among six M. ap
genomes ranged from 56 to 131 (Figure 4), among which 17 were
found in >1 genome (Table 4). The number of non-synonymous
SNPs (nSNPs) is slightly higher than synonymous SNPs (sSNPs),
suggesting a positive selective pressure on the identiﬁed genes. In
addition, most genes harbored one SNP with exceptions of 23
genes that contained two or three SNPs (Table A2 in Appendix).
Interestingly, GlnE and MAPK 4304 contained three SNPs each,
all are nSNPs, suggesting a high selective pressure on these two
genes. Majority of genes contained >1 SNP are larger than 1 kb in
size with an average SNP density of 1 SNP per 1.44 kb. Remain-
ing 232 genes that harbored only one SNP represented a similar
SNP density of one SNP per 1.44 kb that was identiﬁed in other
mycobacterium (Qi et al., 2009). For the M. ap JTC 1281 and M. ap
4B, the percentage of nSNPs were 52.68 and 51.76% respectively,
and the rest of M. ap strains with >60% of SNPs were nSNPs. Inter-
estingly, genes encoding the Cytochrome P450 proteins harbored
a high number of alleles in three of the six examined genomes
(Table 5), similar to the same family of genes in M. tuberculo-
sis (Cole, 1999). Intergenic SNPs were identiﬁed and counted for
<10% of total SNPs.

Generally, a modest number of SNPs were detected among
genomes of M. ap isolates, unlike M. avium isolates. The M.
avium DT 78 genome had a signiﬁcantly high number of SNPs
detected (6,278 SNPs) when compared to the standard M. avium
104 genome suggesting an earlier separation of this strain dur-
ing its evolutionary pathway. In addition, >75% of the identiﬁed
SNPs were synonymous, an indication of a higher stabilizing selec-
tive pressure for M. avium genes than those of M. ap. For the M.
avium Env 77, SNP detection was not performed because the whole
sequence aligned poorly with either M. ap K-10 or M. avium 104.
Finally, 10 SNPs were randomly chosen for further conﬁrmation
using the Sanger sequencing method. The 10 SNPs were chosen
based on the ATCC 19698 genome. The same 10 SNPs were also
found in JTC 1281, while only 5 common SNPs were found in
JTC 1285. All amplicons were sequenced from both forward and
reverse strands (Table A3 in Appendix). Three SNPs were not
detected in JTC 1285 based on the Sanger results, and is most
likely caused by the Illumina sequencer error. Overall, Illumina
sequencing was very beneﬁcial in providing a high level of single
nucleotide polymorphism in all examined genomes.

PHYLO-GENOMIC RELATIONSHIP AMONG M. AP ISOLATES
Single nucleotide polymorphisms of six M. ap strains were con-
catenated and used for phylogenetic analysis on a genome-wide
(phylo-genome) level. The two reference strains, M. ap K-10 and
M. avium 104, were included in the analysis. A total of 301 SNPs
present among the six M. ap strains as well as in M. avium 104 and
M. avium DT 78 genomes were included in this analysis using the
Neighbor-joining method (Tamura et al., 2011). The un-rooted
tree showed a strong discriminatory power of SNP for all exam-
ined isolates based on their origin (Figure 5A) while maintained
branches of M. avium genomes separate from genomes of M. ap

FIGURE 2 | Genome composition of M. avium Env 77. MegaBLAST
algorithm was used to identify closely related bacteria to all contig
sequences from the M. avium Env 77 isolate. Genomes with <10%
homology were excluded from representation. Members of the M.
tuberculosis complex included M. tuberculosis and M. bovis with sequence
divergence <5%. The same criteria was used to formulate M. avium and
M. ap groups.

assembled genomes of the six M. ap isolates to the standard M. ap
K-10 genome using MAUVE software (version 2.3.1; Darling et al.,
2010; Figure 3). Among the potential Indels that could exist among
these genomes, we identiﬁed only gaps that are <1 kb. A common
gap area located at reference position 3,767,550–3,767,870 which is
part of MAPK 3350 gene encoding a hypothetical protein has been
seen among all six strains with a gap size ∼300 bp. At this region,
low or zero read coverage has observed among all six strains sug-
gesting a problematic region for Illumina sequencer. The sequence
in this gap region appeared to have high GC contents (82%) but
no repetitive elements involved.

Based on the MAUVE comparison, the consensus sequences of
these six strains are closely matched to the M. ap K-10 genome and
no inversions were observed (Figure 3). On the other hand, when
MAUVE was used to compare the genome of M. ap isolates to
the M. avium 104 or M. avium DT78 genomes, about seven large
regions of Indels were identiﬁed, conﬁrming earlier ﬁndings by
our group when DNA microarray was used (Wu et al., 2006). For
example, one 11 kb Indel was found in all six M. ap strains at posi-
tion 2,318,400–2,333,740 (MAPK 2038–MAPK 2050) but absent
from M. avium. This 11 kb region encodes mostly hypothetical
proteins in M. ap K-10 genome with two exceptions, MAPK 2040
and MAPK 2050. MAPK 2040 is a predicted hydrolase and earlier
analysis (Santema et al., 2009) also showed the absence of this gene
in M. avium 104, but present in other M. avium strain (Table 3). In
addition, a total of six genomic inversions spanning ∼2.4 Mb were
identiﬁed among all M. ap strains when compared to M. avium
104 genome, similar to our earlier analysis of only M. ap K-10 and
M. avium 104 genomes (Wu et al., 2006).

FIGURE 4 | The total number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
among M. ap isolates. The number of nSNP (non-synonymous) and sSNP
(synonymous) and SNPs in the intergenic regions are color coded as
indicated. SNPs were detected using reference assembled sequences of
each strain. About 60–130 SNPs were detected M. ap isolates. Percentage
of nSNP is generally higher than sSNP which indicates a high selective
pressure in these strains.

isolates. Such discriminatory power was not possible when single-
gene genotypes were tried (see above). Nonetheless, when the tree
was rooted to M. avium 104 genome, two distinct major branches
within the M. ap genomes were easily discerned (Figure 5B).

In one branch within M. ap genomes (Figure 5B), an isolate
from red deer (M. ap DT 3) was closely related to the standard
cattle strains (M. ap K-10 and ATCC 19698). On the other hand,
isolates from goat and oryx (M. ap JTC 1281 and JTC 1285, respec-
tively) were more closely related to the recently isolated cattle type
strain (M. ap K-10) than to other laboratory strain (ATCC 19698),
suggesting a cattle source of infection. In the other branch of the

tree, M. ap 4B and M. ap Env 210 isolates from human and dairy
farm, respectively, were closely related to each other. It is note-
worthy to mention here that the association of M. avium DT 78
genome to the M. avium 104 strain based on phylo-genomic analy-
sis conﬁrmed our earlier identiﬁcation of this isolate to belong M.
avium group despites its overall higher similarity to the M. ap
K-10. Finally, when we tried additional three methods for tree
construction (MP, ML, MLK) on independent lists of sSNPs and
nSNPs, a congregant topology was obtained for all trees with a
high bootstrap support, similar to the one showed in Figure 5B.
The Log Likelihood Ratio test for MLK consensus tree against ML
tree indicated that the molecular clock assumption was not valid
(p < 0.007). Overall, the identiﬁed tree topology suggests that M.
avium 104 as a common ancestor from which M. ap likely emerged
and diversiﬁed into two lineages: a lineage that clustered Env 210
with M. ap 4B (Human) while the second clustered all type II
strains of M. ap. In both lineages, infected cows are the most likely
reservoir for spreading the type II M. ap strains.

DISCUSSION
Understanding the genome-wide variations among pathogenic
Mycobacteria will improve our understanding of the pathogen-
esis and evolution of these important pathogens. Recently, Next-
generation sequencing technologies provided us the opportunity
to examine whole-genome variations on a much faster basis than
traditional sequencing or DNA-microarray technologies. In this
study, M. ap isolates were chosen from diverse hosts, sources,
and locations to better assess the impact of these variations
on pathogen genome composition. As expected, the six M. ap
genomes sequenced in this study shared ∼99% sequence similar-
ity M. ap K-10 reference genome with a modest number of SNPs
(∼100) suggesting a stabilizing selective pressure. On the contrary,
isolates of M. avium origin showed more diversity. For example,
the M. avium DT 78 genome had a signiﬁcant number of gaps
and a large number of SNPs (∼6,000) compared to M. avium
104 despite its signiﬁcant similarity to M. ap K-10 (>90%) on a
whole-genome level. This isolate is likely to represents an inter-
mediate strain between M. avium 104 and M. ap K-10. Generally,
M. avium replicate faster than M. ap and survive in a more diverse
environments, those factors are likely to contribute to adaptive
polymorphism. Previous analyses showed that M. avium has more
diversity than M. ap strains (Turenne et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006).
Additionally, the M. avium Env 77 genome BLAST search indicated
its complex and mosaic structure, another indication of diversity
among M. avium isolates. Although standard genotyping proto-
cols used here (based on hsp65 and IS1311) clearly typed DT78 and
Env 77 isolates as M. avium, our genome sequencing approach
question the validity of genotyping of Mycobacteria based on a
single or a few genes and advocate for a whole-genome based
approach.

Because of the close relatedness of M. ap genomes, SNPs from
each strain provided valuable information on the divergence and
evolutionary process that control members of MAC. A wide range
of studies used SNPs for studying drug resistance mutations in
organisms (Xu et al., 2008), analysis of genomic evolution (Filliol
et al., 2006), and association of M. ap infection to Crohn’s dis-
ease patients (Wynne et al., 2011). In this study, SNPs were used

for genome-wide typing of isolates to understand the dynamics
of Johne’s disease transmission. Examining the modest number
of SNPs detected inM. ap identiﬁed the presence of a higher
percentage of nSNPs in all six M. ap isolates, suggesting a close
relatedness among strains (Gutacker et al., 2002; Holden et al.,
2004; Rocha et al., 2006). This close relationship among M. ap
isolates could indicate a “spillover” infection from cattle to other
animals (in this study red deer). However, the observed higher
percentage of nSNPs could indicate adaptive evolution of M. ap
to different hosts with positive selective pressure. A signiﬁcant
number of nSNPs were located in genes that encode hypothetical
proteins while others in genes that encode proteins with enzymatic
functions, some of them involved in metabolism and energy path-
ways, such as Pks proteins and NuoL protein. Interestingly, a SNP
in the glnE gene were identiﬁed in all six M. ap genomes and
additional SNPs in this gene were observed in ATCC 19698 and
M. ap 4B separately. In M. tuberculosis, GlnE is an adenylyl trans-
ferase modulating glutamine synthetase activity and it is essential
for bacterial growth under alternative nitrogen sources (Carroll
et al., 2008). SNPs within this gene could likely be an indication
of common evolutionary ancestor with environmental isolates.
Similarity, SNPs in cytochrome P450 enzymes (Table 5) that

catalyze mixed oxidation of hydrophobic compounds associated
with free-living saprophyte (Arnold, 2007), another indication of a
common environmental ancestor for M. ap. Finally, genes encod-
ing cytochrome P450 were shown to play a role in the persistence
of M. tuberculosis in tissues (McLean et al., 2010). SNPs found in
M. ap counterpart could potentially contribute to the M. ap-host
interactions.

An interesting outcome of the employed phylo-genomic analy-
sis provided here is the further support provided to the hypothesis
of presence of common origin to both subspecies of M. avium
complex, namely, M. ap and M. avium subsp. avium. Such hypoth-
esis was supported before based on large genomic regions of
insertions/deletions (Wu et al., 2006; Alexander et al., 2009). This
study provides further support to this hypothesis using SNPs on
a genome-wide level. The whole-genome approach we employed
here allowed us to explore the diversity among MAC isolates from
different hosts and variable locations. It also provided more clues
regarding the dynamic of mycobacterial transmission among ani-
mals. Sequencing the genome of more isolates will deﬁnitely enrich
our understanding of the genome content and evolution of both
environmental and pathogenic strains of mycobacteria and will
eventually provide a comprehensive population genetic structure.

Such knowledge base could elucidate the relationship between
strains and host or some special environmental cues. In addi-
tion, sequencing more diverse isolates will help to evaluate the

dynamic of disease transmission among animals or from animals
to humans. Developing algorithms that can utilize the informa-
tion gained from Next-generation sequencers will only improve
