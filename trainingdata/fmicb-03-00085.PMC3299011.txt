†Lanay Tierney and Jörg Linde have

The ability to adapt to diverse micro-environmental challenges encountered within a host
is of pivotal importance to the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans. We have
quantiﬁed C. albicans and M. musculus gene expression dynamics during phagocytosis
by dendritic cells in a genome-wide, time-resolved analysis using simultaneous RNA-seq.
A robust network inference map was generated from this dataset using NetGenerator,
predicting novel interactions between the host and the pathogen. We experimentally veri-
ﬁed predicted interdependent sub-networks comprising Hap3 in C. albicans, and Ptx3 and
Mta2 in M. musculus. Remarkably, binding of recombinant Ptx3 to the C. albicans cell
wall was found to regulate the expression of fungal Hap3 target genes as predicted by the
network inference model. Pre-incubation of C. albicans with recombinant Ptx3 signiﬁcantly
altered the expression of Mta2 target cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-4 in a Hap3-dependent
manner, further suggesting a role for Mta2 in host–pathogen interplay as predicted in the
network inference model. We propose an integrated model for the functionality of these
sub-networks during fungal invasion of immune cells, according to which binding of Ptx3 to
the C. albicans cell wall induces remodeling via fungal Hap3 target genes, thereby altering
the immune response to the pathogen. We show the applicability of network inference to
predict interactions between host–pathogen pairs, demonstrating the usefulness of this
systems biology approach to decipher mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Both host and pathogenic species have evolved a plethora of strate-
gies to rapidly adapt to the changing environmental dynamics
within the infection milieu. However, the extent of this com-
plexity has only recently been investigated through the use of
system biology approaches (reviewed in Rizzetto and Cavalieri,
2011). On the molecular level, these adaptations are mediated by
complex interaction networks, which sense these environmen-
tal changes and transmit the information throughout the cell,
leading to a cascade of changes in gene and eventually protein
expression. Understanding these underlying interaction networks
is important to elucidate how organisms and defense mechanisms
interact during microbial infection processes. Genome-wide inte-
grative approaches for modeling have become increasingly popular
(Rizzetto and Cavalieri, 2011) due to the availability of high-
throughput sequencing technologies, including RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq). These technologies now allow for the parallel sequenc-
ing of millions of nucleotide sequences simultaneously (Wang

et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011). One major advantage to using
sequencing approach rather than microarrays is that it is a species-
independent platform, allowing for an in-depth investigation of
non-model organism species, as well as multiple organisms from
a single experiment.

In many cases, the underlying interaction networks between the
organisms of interest are unknown. Network inference uses reverse
engineering techniques (Hecker et al., 2009b; Marbach et al.,
2010) to predict unknown interaction networks based on high-
throughput gene expression data. A number of approaches have
been established to predict inference networks including Bayesian
network modeling (Friedman et al., 2000), information theoretical
approaches (Butte and Kohane, 2000; Faith et al., 2007), regres-
sion based models (D’Haeseleer et al., 1999; Hecker et al., 2009a),
and differential equation models (Holter et al., 2001; Guthke et al.,
2005, 2007). Biological networks are scale free networks composed
of nodes and edges, where nodes represent the objects of interest
and edges show the relations between those objects (Le Novere

Tierney et al.

An interspecies network inference model

et al., 2009). Biological interaction networks often use nodes to
represent genes or proteins, and edges to show either a direct
or indirection interaction, such as protein binding or transcrip-
tional regulation (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004). Network inference
has been successfully applied to a variety of biological scenarios,
including the modeling of immune diseases (Guthke et al., 2005;
Hecker et al., 2009a), full-genomic models of Escherichia coli (Faith
et al., 2007), and more recently, small scale networks describing
fungal infections (Linde et al., 2010). So far these model have only
focused on a single species and have not addressed host–pathogen
interactions.

In the present work, we have generated the ﬁrst interspecies
computational model of molecular host–pathogen interactions.
We used RNA-seq expression data from an infection time course
of Candida albicans and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells
(BMDCs) from M. musculus. C. albicans is one of the most preva-
lent opportunistic human fungal pathogens. Although C. albicans
normally colonizes the human host, a variety of factors, most
notably immune suppression, can lead to dissemination of fungal
cells throughout the body. This dissemination can lead to a wide
range of diseases, from thrush to multi-organ failure (Gudlaugs-
son et al., 2003). We focused on dendritic cells as our model host
based of their function as antigen-presenting cells, their specializa-
tion in pathogen recognition, and their greater role in activating
and modulating adaptive immune responses (Netea et al., 2008;
Bourgeois et al., 2010). We experimentally veriﬁed predicted sub-
networks of the interspecies inferred regulatory network, which
identiﬁes a role of the transcription factor Hap3 in C. albicans
during in vitro infection. We ﬁnd that fungal Hap3 is regulated
by murine Ptx3, a soluble pattern recognition receptor acting as
an opsonin for pathogens (Diniz et al., 2004). We show that Ptx3
binding to C. albicans regulates fungal Hap3 target genes, altering
the immune response in dendritic cells. Based on the regulation
of downstream cytokines and the regulation of MTA2 mRNA in a
Hap3-dependent manner, we provide indirect evidence for a role
for Mta2, a member of the nucleosome remodeling and histone
deacetylase complex NuRD (Manavathi et al., 2007). We propose a
mechanism whereby Ptx3 binding to C. albicans leads to cell wall
remodeling via fungal Hap3 target genes, thereby changing the
ability of the fungi to be recognized by immune cells. The exper-
imental veriﬁcation of the predicted interspecies interactions is
proof-of-principle that network inference can be used to investi-
gate microbial pathogenesis. We suggest that this could be a useful
method to identify potential antifungal target genes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CANDIDA STRAINS AND GROWTH CONDITIONS
All strains were routinely grown on YPD plates (1% yeast extract,
2% peptone, 2% glucose, 2% agar) and in standard rich media
YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) for liquid cul-
ture at 30˚C. Fungal cells were collected in the logarithmic growth
phase by a brief centrifugation, washed in sterile PBS, and diluted
for all interaction studies. The following strains were used in this
study: C. albicans clinical isolate SC5314 (Gillum et al., 1984)
and homozygous knock-out of Hap3 (hap3Δ/hap3Δ) and rever-
tant strain (hap3Δ/hap3Δ+ CIp10 (HAP3, URA3), abbreviated
in the text as hap3Δ/hap3Δ+ HAP3), were generated from the

strain BWP17 (ura3::imm434/ura3::imm434 iro1/iro1::imm434
his1::hisG/his1::hisG arg4::hisG/arg4::hisG) by stepwise deletion of
both alleles using PCR-ampliﬁed HAP3::ARG4 and HAP3::HIS1
cassettes (Gola et al., 2003) and a cIP10 plasmid containing HAP3
and its promoter and terminator sequences integrated at the RP10
locus (Murad et al., 2000).The homozygous knock-out of cda2
and revertant were kindly provided by Neil Gow (Aberdeen, UK).

CELL CULTURE OF PRIMARY IMMUNE CELLS FROM MOUSE BONE
MARROW
Bone marrow was differentiated to either BMDCs or bone
marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from the femurs of 7-
to 9-week-old wild type C57BL/6 mice and assessed for homo-
geneity as previously described using a panel of marker antibodies
(Bourgeois et al., 2009).

FUNGAL-MAMMALIAN CELL CO-CULTURE
Fungal-mammalian cell co-cultures were performed as previously
described (Bourgeois et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, immune cells were
plated at a density of 1.0× 105 cells/cm2 in sterile cell culture
dishes and incubated with fungal cells at a multiplicity of infec-
tion (MOI) of ﬁve fungal cells per immune cell. Samples were
incubated at 37˚C in 5% CO2, 95% humidity for up to 24 h.

cDNA PREPARATION FOR RNA-seq
Total RNA was isolated from immune cells and C. albicans using
the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, MI, USA)
following manufacturers instructions. To obtain RNA mixtures
from both C. albicans and BMDCs, cells were ﬁrst scraped in the
provided lysis buffer, followed by homogenization with 200 μl
of 0.5 mm acid-washed glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) in a Fast Prep-24 cooling block at 4˚C (MP Bio-
medicals Europe, Illkirch, France) for 45 s at 5 m/s. Ribosomal
RNA was depleted from 10 μg of pooled total RNA samples using
the RiboMinus eukaryote kit for RNA-seq (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and concentrated using the corresponding RiboMi-
nus Concentration Module (Invitrogen) following manufactures
instructions for three independent biological repeats. For each
sample, 1 μg of ribosomal-depleted RNA was converted into
cDNA using the SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis kit and the Advan-
tage 2 polymerase mix (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA).
PCR ampliﬁcations were performed on 1/10 of the ﬁrst strand
synthesis reaction for 18 cycles of 90˚C for 1 min, 95˚C for 15 s,
65˚C for 30 s, and 68˚C for 6 min on a GeneAmp PCR system
9700 (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and puriﬁed on
ChromaSpin columns (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). The
resulting cDNAs were sequenced on the Genome Analyzer IIx at
GATC (Konstanz, Germany) using 36 bp, single run, indexed read
mode.

SEQUENCE READ MAPPING, PRE-PROCESSING, AND DATA
NORMALIZATION
All sequencing reads were mapped using TopHat 1.2.0 (Trapnell
et al., 2009) against the SC5314 C. albicans assembly 21 (Skrzypek
et al., 2010) and the M. musculus UCSC version mm9 from the
ENSEMBL database (Flicek et al., 2011). Mapping was carried out
using the default settings in which only unique hits were kept for

further analysis. The gene expression and normalization analysis
was performed as previously described (Mortazavi et al., 2008).
Genes were tested for differential expression using the bioconduc-
tor package baySeq (Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010) relative to the
0-min infection time point. The analysis was carried out for C.
albicans and M. musculus genes individually.

CLUSTERING AND OVER-REPRESENTED GENE ONTOLOGY TERMS
Fuzzy c-means clustering (Bezdek, 1992) was applied to the
two expression matrices of differentially expressed genes from
C. albicans and M. musculus. The optimal number of clus-
ters was estimated as previously described (Guthke et al., 2005;
Linde et al., 2010). Functional categorization and signiﬁcantly
over-represented categories were identiﬁed using the tool Fungi-
Fun (Priebe et al., 2011). All four hierarchical levels of Funcat
(Ruepp et al., 2004) and Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000)
categorization were used in this study.

NETWORK INFERENCE PREDICTION AND MEASURING INTERACTION
ROBUSTNESS
Network inference was performed as previously described using
the NetGenerator tool (Guthke et al., 2005; Linde et al., 2010).
Brieﬂy, NetGenerator is based on a set of linear differential equa-
tions and models the temporal change of the expression intensity
(i = 1. . .n) at time t as the weighted sum of the
xi(t ) of genei
expression intensities of all other genes and an external stimulus
u(t ) at timet. The external stimulus u(t ) is modeled as a stepwise
constant function representing the change from no host–pathogen
interaction to the onset of the interaction. The tool aims to identify
a network structure, which best ﬁts to the measured RNA-seq data,
while it minimizes the number of predicted interactions (Guthke
et al., 2005). Thus, a sparse network is inferred.

NetGenerator offers the possibility to integrate prior knowl-
edge (i.e., putative regulatory interactions based on additional data
besides the initial time series expression data). Based on the con-
ﬁdence of the prior knowledge source, it is possible to score each
proposed interaction. The conﬁdence of the prior knowledge is
based on the level of experimentation used to verify a speciﬁc inter-
action and the number of independent experiments showing the
same interaction. Since different data sources might be contradic-
tory, prior knowledge is softly integrated, i.e., if a proposed inter-
action contradicts the measured data too much it can be removed
by NetGenerator. Furthermore, the tool may add new interac-
tions not covered by the prior knowledge in order to ﬁt to the
measured data. In this study, prior knowledge from public data-
bases was softly integrated (Guthke et al., 2005). Each proposed
interaction was scored in an additive manner based on the con-
ﬁdence of the prior knowledge source as follows: direct evidence
that a gene is involved in a host–pathogen interaction (conﬁdence
score= 0.5), co-expression of two genes (conﬁdence score= 0.25),
and the occurrence of the respective transcription factor bind-
ing motif in the upstream intergenic regions of genes (conﬁdence
score= 0.125). Prior knowledge was obtained from GeneMania1,
IntAct (Aranda et al., 2010), BioGrid (Stark et al., 2011), the C. albi-
cans database (Skrzypek et al., 2010), the mouse genome database

(Blake et al., 2011), and a number of peer-reviewed publications
(Lane et al., 2001; Doedt et al., 2004; Martchenko et al., 2004;
Zhao et al., 2004; Fradin et al., 2005; Oberholzer et al., 2006; Wang
et al., 2006; Spira et al., 2007; Thewes et al., 2007; Zakikhany et al.,
2007; Almeida et al., 2008; Baek et al., 2008; Nobile et al., 2008;
Frohner et al., 2009; Grifﬁn et al., 2009; Raman et al., 2009; Sellam
et al., 2009; Hinze et al., 2010; Hou et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2010;
Wachtler et al., 2011) summarized in Figure 1C. Putative regula-
tory interactions were tested for robustness using two methods.
First, Gaussian noise was introduced with a mean of 0 and SD 0.05
to the estimated mRNA concentrations for 1000 iterations. Sec-
ondly, predicted interactions were screened for robustness against
changes in prior knowledge by iterating the modeling approach
1000 times while randomly skipping 10% of all interactions in the
set of prior knowledge for each run. Only edges that were con-
ﬁrmed by more than 50% of the iterations were considered to be
robust and used in the resultant model.

CYTOKINE QUANTIFICATION FROM CO-CULTURE SUPERNATANTS
The amount of cytokines released into cell culture supernatants by
immune cells during in vitro interaction studies with heat killed C.
albicans were assayed after 24 h of co-culture using the mouse IL-2,
IL-4, or TNFα Ready-set-go ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapo-
lis, MN, USA) or the Mouse Cytokine Array Panel A kit (R&D
Systems) according to the manufacturers instructions.

BINDING AND LABELING Ptx3 IN VITRO
Recombinant mouse Ptx3 (rmPtx3) protein (R&D Systems) was
reconstituted in sterile PBS and diluted for all experiments.
Some 0.5× 106 fungal cells were incubated for 1 h at 37˚C
with 5 μg reconstituted rmPtx3. Ptx3 was labeled with the pri-
mary antibody against Ptx3 (Abnova, Taiwan) and secondarily

We used massively parallel RNA sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq)
obtained from co-cultures of C. albicans and M. musculus BMDCs
over 2 h to model an infection time course from fungal adhesion
to early host cell lysis. In total, we obtained approximately 120
million reads, which were mapped to the C. albicans 21 assembly
or M. musculus mm9 genome and analyzed each for differential
gene expression relative to the pre-infection state. We identiﬁed
545 differentially expressed genes for C. albicans and 240 for M.
musculus over the complete time course.

The small number of measured data points for each gene over
the time course restricts the modeling approach to a limited num-
ber of genes. If there was no pre-selection of the genes, or a large
number of genes were to be used, it would result in an over-ﬁtting
of the measured data that would not produce a robust inference
model. For this reason, it is necessary to select a set of relevant
genes to be represented by nodes in the network model. To identify
candidate genes in C. albicans and M. musculus, all differentially
expressed genes were ﬁrst clustered (Bezdek, 1992) by their kinetics
during the time course (Figures 1A,B). From each cluster, one or
more representative genes were chosen for use within the model.
Several considerations were taken into account for the selection
of candidate genes. In C. albicans, we preferentially chose genes
that have been either annotated as virulence genes (i.e., adhe-
sion, hyphal formation, or response to host) or strongly respond
to infection or infection-like conditions (i.e., temperature stress,
nutrient limitation, or iron regulation). For M. musculus, we pri-
oritized genes with phenotypes relating to the immune defense or
response, or susceptibility to pathogens in a systemic mouse model
of infection.

A number of recent studies have shown the reverse engineer-
ing approach is greatly improved by the integration of different
data sources (Werhli and Husmeier, 2007; Gustafsson et al., 2008;
Hecker et al., 2009a,b). We therefore collected putative regulatory
interactions based on additional data obtained from literature,
referred to as prior knowledge, for each gene. Based on the con-
ﬁdence of the prior knowledge source, a score is attributed to
each interaction (see Materials and Methods). Since different data
sources might be contradictory, prior knowledge was softly inte-
grated so that if a proposed interaction contradicts the measured
data to a great extent, it can be removed from the resulting network
(see Materials and Methods). Genes with no known or predicted
function were therefore excluded from the analysis. Based on these
criteria, we narrowed our gene lists to ﬁve from C. albicans and six
from M. musculus. Prior knowledge scores (Figure 1C) and expres-
sion kinetics (Figure 1D) for the candidate genes were combined in
NetGenerator to generate the ﬁnal network inference (Figure 1E).
To verify the ﬁt of the model to the actual expression kinetics
of the candidate genes, we ﬁrst used NetGenerator to interpolate
and simulate gene expression for the measured data points of each
gene (Figure 1D). The closer expression proﬁles for the individual

genes ﬁt to the measured data points, the better the inference pre-
diction is. We found a close relationship between the simulated
and measured data points, showing that the NetGenerator model
is representative of the measured data. The ﬁnal interspecies net-
work was based on these predictions (Figure 1E). Only edges that
were robust against the addition of Gaussian noise and partial
skipping of prior knowledge were used in the construction of the
model. The ﬁnal network predicts 21 putative edges, including 4
interspecies edges.

To speciﬁcally test the robustness of the interspecies edges
experimentally, we focused on a sub-network composed of a sin-
gle C. albicans transcription factor Hap3 that was predicted in
the inference model to contain two interactions with M. musculus
genes. These interactions include a predicted blunt or repressing
edge between fungal Hap3 by murine Ptx3, and a predicted blunt
edge of murine Mta2 by fungal Hap3 itself.

THE BINDING OF MURINE Ptx3 REGULATES Hap3 TARGET GENES
Pentraxin 3 (Ptx3) is a soluble pattern recognition receptor that
has been previously shown to function as an opsonin to facili-
tate pathogen uptake by phagocytic cells in a dectin-1 dependent
manner (Diniz et al., 2004). To determine if M. musculus Ptx3
blocked fungal Hap3 function or the expression of Hap3-regulated
genes in C. albicans as suggested by the inference model, we
ﬁrst asked whether Ptx3 was induced upon infection with Can-
dida cells. Using intracellular staining for Ptx3, we detected a
strong ﬂuorescence signal in BMDMs infected with C. albicans,
−/−
whereas no signal was detected in BMDMs alone or ptx3
macrophages (Figures 2A,B). Furthermore, we found an increase
in PTX3 mRNA levels in BMDCs (Figure 2C) and BMDMs (data
not shown) after 1 h of C. albicans infection, verifying that Ptx3
is indeed induced in our experimental setup. Interestingly, the
amount of PTX3 induced signiﬁcantly decreased in the absence
of Hap3 (Figure 2C). We detected a similarly signiﬁcant decrease
in PTX3 induction in the gene containing the Hap3 binding box,
Cda2, a predicted chitin deacetylase in C. albicans.

Ptx3 has been previously shown to bind to numerous fungi,
including Aspergillus fumigatus (Jaillon et al., 2007) as well as
zymosan-coated particles (Diniz et al., 2004). Therefore, we asked
whether recombinant mouse Ptx3 (rmPtx3) could also bind to
the C. albicans cell wall. We assessed rmPtx3 binding using
ﬂuorescence microscopy and ﬂow cytometry. Fungal cells pre-
incubated with rmPtx3 for 1 h at 37˚C showed surface localization
of Ptx3 to the cell wall. No signal was visible on cells treated
with the PE-conjugated secondary alone or the untreated con-
trol (Figure 2E). Notably, the labeling pattern of Ptx3 coincided
with areas of expected chitin exposure. Hence, we also stained C.
albicans cells with Calcoﬂuor White, a ﬂuorescent dye that binds
to exposed chitin (Bulawa et al., 1995). Interestingly, the local-
ization of rmPtx3 on the C. albicans overlapped with the signal
detected for Calcoﬂuor White alone (Figure 2E), suggesting that
Ptx3 might bind to accessible cell surface chitin. We conﬁrmed
and quantiﬁed the amount of Ptx3 binding to the cell wall using
ﬂow cytometry. Based on the binding observed in the ﬂuorescence
microscopy, we analyzed our data using both the complete pool of
C. albicans cells as well as discriminating yeast and hyphal forms
(Figure 2D; Figure A1 in Appendix). We detected a high level of

An interspecies network inference model

Given that rmPtx3 binds to the fungal cell surface, we assessed
if rmPtx3 binding inﬂuenced the expression of predicted fungal
Hap3 target genes as predicted by the inferred network using qPCR
(Figure 2F). There are 10 predicted target genes of Hap3 that were
recently identiﬁed in a network inference study using microarray
data from C. albicans during in vitro epithelial infection, where
iron is assumed to be limited (Linde et al., 2010). Out of the 10
putative Hap3 target genes, we found three, TUP1, FRE6, and SEF1,
whose expressions were signiﬁcantly decreased in C. albicans after
rmPtx3 binding, verifying their functionality as Hap3 target genes.
Interestingly, the levels of these genes increased in the Hap3 knock-
out. These data strongly suggest that their down-modulation upon
binding of rmPtx3 is Hap3-dependent.

CANDIDA ALBICANS BOUND BY Ptx3 ATTENUATES THE IMMUNE
RESPONSE IN BMDCs
Recently it was shown that the binding of recombinant human
Ptx3 increases A. fumigatus conidia phagocytosis and inﬂuences
cytokine production. Those mice lacking Ptx3 were additionally
found to be more susceptible to A. fumigatus infection (Moalli
et al., 2011). To determine if the binding of Ptx3 to C. albicans
changed the cytokine production of murine immune cells in vitro,
we ﬁrst investigated the gross immune response using a cytokine
array after 24 h of co-culture with BMDCs (Figure A2 in Appen-
dix). RmPtx3-bound C. albicans induced multiple cytokines com-
pared to untreated C. albicans including IL-2, a cytokine regulated
by Mta2, as well as the inﬂammatory cytokines KC, JE, and TNFα
(Figures A2 in Appendix). Interestingly, when we then compared
Hap3 knock-out cells pre-incubated with rmPtx3, we detected a
general increase in these cytokines in addition to IL-23, IL-17,
IL-16, and IL-10 that were not detected in using wild type C.
albicans (Figure A2 in Appendix).

Since the cytokine array is a qualitative assessment of cytokine
production with a relatively high detection threshold, we veriﬁed
the changes in cytokine levels for the cytokines most relevant to
the inference model, namely, IL-2 and IL-4, both target cytokines
of Mta2, and TNFα, a pleiotropic inﬂammatory cytokine, by
ELISA. Mta2 is a member of the NuRD (nucleosome remodel-
ing and histone deacetylase) complex in M. musculus (Manavathi
et al., 2007) and predicted in our network model as repressed
by Hap3. The cytokines IL-2 and IL-4 produced during the host
immune response were both recently identiﬁed as targets of the
Mta2/NuRD complex (Lu et al., 2008). We found that in BMDCs,
MTA2 increased in the absence of Hap3, suggesting that Hap3
might indirectly regulate expression of Mta2 (Figure 3A). We
quantiﬁed cellular cytokine release using wild type BMDCs with
C. albicans, wild type BMDCs with rmPtx3-bound C. albicans, and
ptx3
BMDCs. We found that the production of IL-2 and IL-
4 signiﬁcantly increased in the absence of Hap3 (Figures 3B,C).
This increase was augmented by C. albicans cells pre-incubated
with rmPtx3, conﬁrming our observation from the cytokine array
that there is a general increase in the production of these cytokines
when there is an increase in Ptx3. Interestingly, compared to wild
type BMDCs, the basal level of cytokine production of IL-2 and
IL-4 increased in ptx3
BMDCs, corresponding to our inferred
network prediction that the loss of its predicted negative regu-
lators, Ptx3 and fungal Hap3, would increase the expression of

−/−

−/−

Mta2 and thereby increase the expression of its target cytokines.
In Hap3 knock-out cells, we found both on the cytokine arrays and
by ELISA a signiﬁcant decrease in TNFα (Figure 3D). These data
show that the binding of Ptx3 to fungal cells alters the cytokine
production by immune cells in a Hap3-dependent manner, and
the regulation of Mta2 target cytokines indirectly suggests an
involvement of Mta2 as predicted by the network inference model.

IDENTIFYING CELL SURFACE Hap3 TARGET GENES
To identify how immune cells could detect the regulation of the
transcription factor Hap3 in C. albicans, we searched for puta-
tive Hap3 target genes that could have more direct contact with
immune cells, including: cell wall, plasma membrane or secretory
proteins. We focused on C. albicans genes of cluster 2, since their
expression strongly increased expression over the time course of
invasion (Figure 1B). Within this cluster, we scanned for genes
harboring the binding site of the Hap-complex in their upstream
regulatory regions (Baek et al., 2008). We further narrowed down
the candidate list by removing genes that did not have a pre-
dicted cellular localization or function in the C. albicans database
(Skrzypek et al., 2010). Following these selection criteria, nine can-
didate genes were left that we used to infer an additional network in
combination with Ptx3, Hap3, and Mta2 to determine if an inter-
action could be inferred with a protein that could come in direct
contact with immune cells (Figure A3 in Appendix). To increase
the reliability of the putative Hap3 interactions within the new
interaction network, we included the validated interactions from
our experiments within this study (repression of HAP3 by Ptx3
and MTA2 by Hap3), as additional prior knowledge. Of all of the
candidate genes, only the activation of CDA2 (a putative chitin
deacetylase in C. albicans) by Hap3, was robust against Gaussian
noise and partial skipping of prior knowledge.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we aimed to infer a network that predicts interactions
between host and pathogenic species under infection settings. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst network inference approach pre-
dicting host–pathogen interactions. This approach allowed for
the prediction, identiﬁcation, and experimental veriﬁcation of
interdependent sub-networks composed of a single C. albicans
transcription factor Hap3, and the M. musculus genes Ptx3 and
Mta2. The experimental validation suggests a putative mecha-
nism to explain how these interactions could be regulated during
infection of immune cells by fungal pathogens.

Our modeling approach was fundamentally based on differen-
tial equations, which have been previously used to infer regulatory
network models (Toepfer et al., 2007; Linde et al., 2010). This
approach is generally suitable for time series data. Nevertheless,
this approach is inappropriate for large-scale modeling, because
a large number of genes incorporated into a differential equa-
tion based model leaves open a number of parameters to be
identiﬁed. This may result in an over-ﬁtting of the data. The mod-
eling approach uses four attempts to prevent over-ﬁtting. First,
we restrict the number of genes within the model such that a
smaller number of parameters need to be identiﬁed. Second, it
aims at inferring a sparse network where many parameters are zero.
Thirdly, it makes use of re-sampling techniques where the data are

perturbed in a random manner. Finally, we make use of prior
knowledge guiding the inferred structure to a knowledge-based
solution. Thus skipping incorrect network structures.

Gene expression levels, as well as available prior biological
knowledge, were used to aid in the narrowing of genes that we
chose to incorporate into the model. For this reason, genes where
no biological knowledge was available were excluded from fur-
ther analysis. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that
additional genes of unknown function might also play a role in
our inference model. This remains a limitation of the modeling
approach, in so far as predictions can only be made for genes where
a reasonable amount or prior knowledge is available. The genes
incorporated into the model represent only one possible scenario
of interactions and we do not exclude the possibility that other
genes may play a role under other conditions. We have already
started to take ﬁrst step for a full-genomic network modeling for
C. albicans utilizing a compendium of all available expression data
(Altwasser et al., 2012). Moreover, we primarily focused on genes
acting as putative network“hubs”in their organisms (Bulawa et al.,
1995). Hubs are genes such as transcription factors that regulate
many other downstream genes within a network either directly or
indirectly. Hubs were chosen because they are less likely to have
redundant roles. Therefore, we would expect a stronger pheno-
type than investigating genes that are sparsely connected. This also
means that the interactions we are investigating are more likely to
be indirect and should be interpreted with caution.

From our original candidate gene list, we inferred HAP3 as a
putative network hub targeted by innate immune cells. Interest-
ingly, several putative target genes of Hap3 identiﬁed in this study
are predicted to localize to the plasma membrane, cell wall, or are
involved with cell wall reorganization in C. albicans. The fungal
cell wall is a dynamic structure, which undergoes signiﬁcant struc-
tural and molecular composition remodeling throughout its life
cycle, as well as in response to a variety of external stimuli (Chafﬁn,
2008). As Hap3 in C. albicans is a transcription factor up-regulated
under iron-limiting conditions (Linde et al., 2010), it is likely
that its function during fungal recognition or phagocytosis by
immune cells is indirect. Of all of the candidate cell surface Hap3
targets, only Cda2, a putative chitin deacetylase forms a robust
interaction with Hap3 within the second network (Figure A3 in
Appendix). Chitin deacetylase enzymes exists in both intracellu-
lar and secreted forms in different fungi, where they hydrolyzes
the acetamido group in the N -acetylglucosamine units of chitin
and chitosan, leaving glucosamine units and acetic acid form as
byproducts (Zhao et al., 2010). Chitin deacetylases exist in both
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Martinou et al., 2002) and in the oppor-
tunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, where they have
been suggested as an antifungal target due to their severe effect on
cell wall integrity (Baker et al., 2007). Notably, chitin deacety-
lases are secreted during different developmental stages of some
other fungi (Zhao et al., 2010). For example, in Colletotrichum
lindemuthianum, a plant fungal pathogen, chitin deacetylases are

exclusively secreted during hyphal penetration into plant tissue
(Tokuyasu et al., 1996). We ﬁnd that Ptx3 induction is decreased
in the CDA2 knock-out (Figure 2C), further suggesting a possible
connection to the inferred network model. These data are consis-
tent with the overlap of Ptx3 staining and that of Calcoﬂuor White
(Figure 2E), which binds to exposed chitin. Therefore, it is tempt-
ing to speculate that the recognition of C. albicans by immune
cells triggers the production of this enzyme to induce cell wall
remodeling as an evasion strategy. However, further work beyond
the scope of this study is needed to decipher the speciﬁc function
of Cda2 in C. albicans and its connection to Hap3.

We observed that upon binding of rmPtx3 to fungal cells, the
C. albicans virulence genes TUP1, FRE6, and SEF1 mRNA levels
signiﬁcantly decreased in a Hap3-dependent manner (Figure 2F).
Tup1 has a well-characterized role as a key regulator in C. albicans
morphogenesis (Braun and Johnson, 1997). We cannot exclude
the possibility that Hap3 and Tup1 may have similar or even
complementary functions during interaction with immune cells.
Interestingly, both Tup1 and Fre6 are either directly or indirectly
involved in the C. albicans cell wall homeostasis. Tup1 is a multi-
functional transcriptional co-repressor of ﬁlamentous growth in
C. albicans whose lack leads to constitutive ﬁlamentous growth
(Braun and Johnson, 1997; Park and Morschhäuser, 2005). Fre6 is
an uncharacterized protein, for which in silico predictions suggest
it to reside in the plasma membrane with a putative functional
similarity to the ferric reductase Fre10, an important protein in
iron acquisition (Knight et al., 2005). Therefore, their regulation
upon binding or phagocytosis might play an additional role in
cell wall remodeling during infection. Since fungal cells experi-
ence severe iron-limiting condition within phagosomes of host

−/−

cells, Hap3 and Fre6 appear as logical candidates involved in this
reciprocal interaction. Likewise, Sef1 regulates iron uptake, and
has recently been shown to promote virulence in a mouse model
of bloodstream infections (Chen et al., 2011). Interestingly, it was
shown that knock-out mice lacking Ptx3 are hyper-susceptible to
A. fumigatus (Moalli et al., 2010). However, no in vivo work has
been performed to date using ptx3
mice and C. albicans. A
recent study has shown that the activation of the complement
system via the lectin pathway can be triggered via a complex of
Ptx3 and mannose binding lectin (MBL) on C. albicans mannan
in vitro (Ma et al., 2011). They showed the MBL–Ptx3 complex
could enhance the deposition of the complement components
C3 and C4 and thereby increase phagocytosis of C. albicans by
polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It has previously been shown that
C3 knock-out mice are additionally more susceptible to C. albi-
cans infections (Han et al., 2001). Therefore, it is possible that the
absence of Ptx3 could result in reduced activation of the comple-
ment pathway and reduced fungal killing. In vivo studies using
ptx3

−/−
We found that the expression of MTA2 and the regulation
of its downstream targets such as cytokines IL-2 and IL-4, are
increased during immune cell invasion by C. albicans in a Hap3-
dependent manner (Figures 3B,C). Moreover, we found that an
altered-immune response is one consequence of rmPtx3 binding.
Mta2 knock-out mice display partial embryonic lethality, while
the surviving mice develop lupus-like autoimmune symptoms,
including severe developmental phenotypes (Lu et al., 2008). Mta2
is uniquely associated with the NuRD chromatin complex, which
has both nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activ-
ity (Feng and Zhang, 2003). Although there has been no data

mice would be needed to investigate this hypothesis.

An interspecies network inference model

to date in fungi indicating a role for host chromatin in patho-
genesis, recent work in bacteria and viruses (Hamon and Cossart,
2008; Rohde, 2011) shows that chromatin remodeling is induced in
host cells during invasion. Consistent with these observations, our
data suggests that the regulation of MTA2 may affect chromatin
remodeling in immune cells in the response to fungal pathogens.
The resultant altered-immune response may be disadvantageous
to the pathogen because it would promote fungal clearance.

We propose that Hap3 constitutes a target hub of C. albicans,
which actively regulates immune responses through the reorga-
nization of the C. albicans cell wall during invasion of innate
immune cells (Figure 4). Speciﬁcally, we propose a model in which
the binding of Ptx3 released from immune cells to C. albicans
cell wall triggering the reorganization of the C. albicans cell wall
and plasma membrane via the activation of Hap3 target genes.
This reorganization in turn changes the recognition of the fun-
gus by immune cells and attenuates the host immune response.
This work demonstrates the possibility to experimentally verify
predicted host–pathogen relationships based on an interspecies
model of network inference, showing that inference modeling can
be used in the investigation of microbial pathogenesis. We propose
that this method could be useful for the identiﬁcation of antifungal
target genes.

FIGURE A1 | FACS analysis of rmPtx3 binding to C. albicans yeast and
hyphal cells. SC5314 after 1-h treatment with rmPtx3. Cells were gated
according to morphology based on size, all Candida cells analyzed (green

gate), yeast form only (black gate) and hyphal form only (the brown gate).
Histograms for untreated cells (red), and treated rmPtx3 and SC5314 (blue)
are shown.

FIGURE A3 | Inferred network model between C. albicans and M.
musculus using of candidate Hap3 effector genes. C. albicans (blue)
and M. musculus genes (green) included in the model are shown. The
following interactions are represented on the model: predicted
interactions based on the RNA-seq data set from individual species where

no prior knowledge exists (black) or predicted interactions between a C.
albicans and M. musculus gene where no prior knowledge exists (red), or
where prior knowledge exists but does not corresponds to expression
data set (gray, dotted). Here, activation is shown as a pointed arrow and a
repression a blunted arrow.
