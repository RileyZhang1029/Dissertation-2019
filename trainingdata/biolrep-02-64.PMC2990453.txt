Abstract
The latest high-throughput DNA sequencing technology can now be applied on a large scale to
capture the complete set of mRNA transcripts in a cell, using a technique called RNA-seq. Although
RNA-seq is only 2 years old, it has rapidly swept through the field of genomics, and it is now being
used to analyze the transcriptomes of organisms ranging from bacteria to primates. The depth of
sequencing allows researchers to quantify the level of expression of genes, to discover alternative
isoforms in eukaryotic species, and even to characterize the operon structure of bacterial genomes.

Introduction and context
Sequencing the mRNA in a cell has been used as a high-
throughput method for finding genes since the early days
of the human genome project. Beginning in the early
1990s, the expressed sequence tag (EST) method was used
to capture fragments of thousands of human genes [1]
prior to the sequencing of the genome. EST sequencing
relies on the fact that eukaryotic genes are polyadenylated
after transcription, and the long poly-A tract can be used to
capture the transcripts via reverse transcription PCR (RT-
PCR). The EST method was subsequently applied to many
other species, and EST databases (notably dbEST) became
a vital resource for genome annotation. Recently, a ‘next-
gen’ version of EST sequencing has emerged, allowing
researchers to capture and sequence mRNA at dramatically
lower cost, and higher volume, than was ever possible with
the EST method. The new RNA-seq methods [2-5] are
being applied to a rapidly growing variety of species, cell
types, and scientific questions, revealing far more about
the transcriptomes of these species than was known just a
few years ago. The field is advancing so rapidly that a brief
review cannot cover the work of the past 2 years; this
review is just a sampling of a few highlights.

Major recent advances
Sultan et al. [6] analyzed approximately 8 million short
reads and found that RNA-seq could detect 25% more

genes as compared to microarrays. About one-third of
transcripts in their experiments mapped to genomic
regions not annotated as genes. Of the 94,241 splice
junctions, 4096 were novel, and many of these indicated
exon skipping events. This result has been amplified by
subsequent studies that generated even more sequences
and showed even larger numbers of novel splicing events.
Trapnell et al. [7] generated approximately 430 million
paired-end reads to recover 13,692 known isoforms from
mouse myoblast cells, but also detected 12,712 novel
isoforms, of which 7395 contained novel splice junctions
while the rest represented novel combinations of known
exons. This latter study also demonstrated the power of a
new algorithm capable of detecting and quantifying
alternative isoforms when aligning RNA-seq reads to a
genome. In an RNA-seq study using liver RNA samples
from humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques,
Blekhman et al. [8] found that alternative splicing events
vary between closely related primates and also between
the sexes within species. Wang et al. [9] generated
approximately 600 million short reads from 15 cell
types and found that 92-94% of human genes are
alternatively spliced, and that many alternative splicing
events are tissue-specific. RNA-seq is also being used to
study genetic variation among individuals (expression
quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs). Pickrell et al. [10] and
Montgomery et al. [11] combined RNA-seq data and

HapMap data from 69 Nigerian individuals and 63
Caucasian individuals, respectively, and both groups
identified variants responsible for alternative splicing as
well as variation in expression levels among individuals.

In single-celled organisms, RNA-seq can reveal novel
insights about polycistronic transcripts.
In the first
transcriptome analysis of Trypanosoma brucei, thousands
of splicing and polyadenylation sites were identified and
many genes were found to be differentially expressed
between the parasite’s two life-cycle stages [12]. In
prokaryotes, RNA-seq can provide an extremely detailed
transcription map, at the single-base level, as has been
shown recently in an archaeal species, Sulfolobus solfatar-
icus, and in a pathogen bacterium, Helicobacter pylori. In
S. solfataricus, over 1000 transcriptional start sites were
detected and 80 novel protein-coding genes were
discovered [13]. In H. pylori, hundreds of transcriptional
start sites within operons were found, as well as
approximately 60 novel small RNA genes [14].

Future directions
The power of RNA-seq stems from its ability to generate
deep coverage of the entire transcriptome of a cell with
just a single run of a high-throughput sequencer, such as
the Illumina HiSeq, which can produce up to 200 billion
bases in a single run. The potential to characterize all
genes, to capture alternative isoforms, and to measure
differential expression has already been demonstrated in
dozens of studies, but hundreds of species, and countless
experimental conditions, are yet to be explored. Several
groups have developed methods besides poly-A selection
to capture all RNAs in a cell, for example, random
hexamer priming [13,15], which allows them to analyze
prokaryotic transcriptomes or to look at noncoding RNA
in eukaryotes. It now appears that RNA-seq will replace
microarray technology in the coming years, as it appears
to be not only more comprehensive but also much more
accurate than microarrays, particularly for transcripts
with low expression levels [16]. As this new method
becomes even more widely adopted, it should greatly
expand our understanding of the complex interplay of
genes in all phases of cell development.
