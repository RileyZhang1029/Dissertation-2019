To overcome this problem, we simultaneously employed real-time PCR to examine gene expression and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of mass spectrometry (MS) to examine the protein expression of AKRs in ﬁve different hepatic cell lines.
These include one rela- tively normal hepatic cell line, L-02, and four hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, HepG2, HuH7, BEL7402 and SMMC7721.
The results of real-time PCR showed that expression of genes encoding the AKR1C family members rather than AKR1A and AKR1B was associated with tumor, and most of genes encoding AKRs were highly expressed in HuH7.
Similar observations were obtained through MRM.
Different from HuH7, the protein abundance of AKR1A and AKR1B was relatively consistent among the other four hepatic cell lines, while protein expression of AKR1C varied signiﬁcantly compared to L-02.
Therefore, we conclude that the abundant distri- bution of AKR1C proteins is likely to be associated with liver tumorigenesis, and the AKR expres- sion status in HuH7 is completely different from other liver cancer cell lines.
This study, for the ﬁrst time, provided both overall and quantitative information regarding the expression of AKRs at both mRNA and protein levels in hepatic cell lines.
Our observations put the previous use of AKRs as a biomarker into question since it is only consistent with our data from HuH7.
Furthermore, the data presented herein demonstrated that quantitative evaluation and comparisons within a protein fam- ily at both mRNA and protein levels were feasible using current techniques.

Production and hosting by Elsevier  Introduction  Aldo keto reductases (AKRs), which include approximately 160 members, are a protein superfamily that is widely distrib- uted from prokaryotes to eukaryotes [1 3].
Most AKRs are generally believed to be the pivotal enzymes for the detoxiﬁca- tion of reactive aldehydes [4].
To date, 13 AKR proteins have been identiﬁed in humans, including AKR1A1 (aldehyde  1672-0229/$ - see front matter ª 2013 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of China.

Over recent years, it has be- come that many human AKRs are intimately linked with cancer biology.
Expression of some AKR1 members that may be induced by oxidative stress and participate in different signaling pathways of cell proliferation was increased in different types of cancer.
For example, expres- sion of AKR1B10 and AKR1C3 increased the risk of cancer in the target organ through the retinal reductase activity, thus leading to reduction in retinoic acid (RA) biosynthesis [6].
AKR7 family is involved in the metabolism of aﬂatoxin [7], which is a well-known carcinogen for the liver.
Despite these studies, the signiﬁcance of the involvement of AKRs in can- cers, however, is not yet fully elucidated.
Moreover, which AKR member is speciﬁcally related with cancer type is still inconclusive.
For instance, overexpression of AKR1B10 was considered as a novel biomarker for non-small cell lung carci- noma (NSCLC) [8].
The association of AKR1B10 in NSCLC with smoking was established by microarray analysis and con- ﬁrmed by RT-PCR, immunobloting and immunohistochemis- try (IHC) in paired samples of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and noncancerous tissues [8 11].
However, the associa- tion did not gain strong support from other large screenings in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics [12].
Lin et al.
re- ported that, AKR1C3 was consistently overexpressed in ductal carcinoma tissues of breast cancer in situ using IHC [13].
Ji et al.
took a similar strategy but came to the opposite results that selective loss of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 was found in 24 paired breast cancer tissues, whereas AKR1C3 was only minimally affected in the same samples [14].
Besides AKR1B10 and AKR1C3, abnormal expression of other AKR members, such as AKR1A1 [15], AKR1B1 [16,17], AKR1C1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C4 [14,18 29], was detected in various cancer tis- sues or cells.
However, employment of different approaches in different studies has led to conﬂicting results, which are not easily further cross validated by other approaches or labo- ratories due to the different samples examined, expression lev- els and even different cut-offs.
The controversial observations regarding AKRs and cancer necessitate the development of an approach to accurately eval- uate the AKR abundances in cells and tissues.
Fundamentally, three questions ought to be addressed.
First of all, most previ- ous studies on AKR gene expression have only reported one or several AKR members, there lacks general understanding of the expression proﬁle for all the AKR family members.
As many AKR enzymes convert the similar substrates following the same catalytic mechanism in vivo [30], it is likely that the protein abundances would compensate for each other [31,32].
Therefore, focusing on individual AKRs rather than the family has probably led to misinterpretation of the biological signiﬁ- cance of the expression status of AKRs in cancers.
Secondly, the conﬂicting conclusions regarding AKR expression were of- ten drawn from different measurements, at mRNA or protein level.
As mRNA abundance is not closely and linearly corre- lated with protein abundance for many genes, conclusion only derived from the mRNA or protein assay may lead to a dis- torted view of expression.
Hence, monitoring the AKR expres- sion status in cells or tissues at both mRNA and protein levels should be more appropriate.
Thirdly, for global screening of  the tumor-associated genes, traditional techniques such as DNA/RNA array and protein proﬁling are often lacking in accurate quantitative information, such that screening data are not always comparable with targeting data in biomarker discovery.
How to quantitatively evaluate the AKR expression is another key issue required to clarify the controversial argu- ment of the relationship of AKRs with cancers.
Therefore, we carried out the global evaluation of the AKR expression status in cancer cell lines, trying to address the three issues mentioned above.
Liver is an important organ involved in detoxiﬁcation in the human body and contains all types of human AKR proteins to perform such functions.
Several investigators reported that the abnormal expression of AKR proteins in liver tumor tissues or cells possibly resulted in loss of detoxiﬁcation functions [33,34].
For instance, Cao et al.
observed that expression of AKR1A1 remained unchanged while AKR1B1 was overexpressed in HCC [35].
However, Goh et al.
found that expression of AKR1A1 was decreased, while AKR1B1 did not change signif- icantly in HCC [36].
Therefore, liver cancer cells or tissues would be ideal for quantitatively evaluating the AKR expression status, either to detect the expression of AKR mem- bers globally or to clarify the argument on the AKR roles in li- ver cancers.
Therefore, four liver cancer cell lines were chosen to evaluate the global expression of AKRs.
The obtained re- sults were further validated at the protein level using 55 pairs of HCC samples and adjacent tissues.
In this study, we designed an analysis strategy aiming at globally and quantitatively to determine the abundance of individual AKRs at both mRNA and protein in the selected cell lines.
We employed real-time PCR to monitor the expres- sion of AKR mRNAs and MRM-based MS to detect the expression of AKR proteins.
With calibration and normaliza- tion, we produced the proﬁles for the abundance distribution of all the AKR gene products, and demonstrated the correla- tion of the AKRs and cancer cell lines.
Results  Preparation for quantitative evaluation of AKR expression in hepatic cell lines and tissues  Totally 13 AKRs have been reported in human.
These include 10 AKRs with the aldo keto enzyme activities, such as AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1B10, AKR1C1 1C4, AKR1D1, AKR7A2 and AKR7A3, and 3 AKRs without the catalytic functions, such as AKR6A3, AKR6A5 and AKR6A9.
As detoxiﬁcation by AKRs is believed to be involved in tumori- genesis and tumor development, the AKR members without enzymatic activities were not considered in this study.
Besides, there is a high homology in the amino acid sequences of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 (approximately 97%) and the high identity of the two genes makes the measurement at either mRNA or protein levels technically difﬁcult.
These two AKRs were thus regarded as a single protein product termed as AKR1C1/1C2 in this study.
In total, 9 AKRs were selected for quantitative evaluation of including AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1B10, AKR1C1/1C2, AKR1C3, AKR1C4, AKR1D1, AKR7A2 and AKR7A3.
Each unique peptide had four qualiﬁed transitions.
their expression,   232  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 230 240  The techniques of real-time PCR and MRM are appropri- ate for the quantiﬁcation of mRNA and protein abundances, because they can provide relatively accurate quantitative infor- mation.
During measurements, design of both the real-time PCR primers and the MRM unique peptides for each AKR is fundamentally important to clearly distinguish the AKR members.
As a matter of fact, it was not an easy job to select the primers or peptides in such enzyme family, since these members share such high sequence homology at either nucleo- tide or amino acid levels.
Primers that are able to amplify the unique sequences of various AKR genes with a length of 100  200 bp were synthesized and carefully evaluated for ampliﬁca- tion in pilot experiments prior to the real-time PCR experi- ments (sequencing validation was shown in Figure S1).
However, expression of AKR1D1 and AKR7A3 was not de- tected in our samples (data not shown).
In peptide design for MRM, the similar difﬁculty appeared in selecting multiple un- ique peptides of AKRs due to the highly homologous amino acid sequences in AKR proteins.
Thus the selection of proper peptides/transitions was based on the recombinant AKRs identiﬁed by MS.
Using data-independent acquisition to detect all the digested peptides of each AKR protein in an EMS EPI scan (the shotgun scan preformed on QTRAP5500 by a com- bination of enhanced MS and product ion scans), high quality MS/MS signals corresponding to the AKR peptides were ac- quired.
Furthermore, according to the criteria for selecting the MRM peptide, the AKR transitions were predicted with MRM pilot in MRM EPI mode (MRM triggered enhanced product ion scan).
Taking into accounts of the scanning results from EMS EPI and MRM EPI upon the AKR recombinant peptides, numbers of qualiﬁed AKR peptides for MRM were ﬁnally deﬁned, that is, two unique peptides for AKR1A1, AKR1B1 and AKR1B10, and single unique peptide for the remaining AKR1C1/1C2, AKR1C3, AKR1C4 and AKR7A2.
According to our experimental design, it would be valuable to evaluate the AKR expression not only within cell lines but also at tissue level.
Technically speaking, both techniques,  real-time PCR and MRM, are difﬁcult to use in tissue samples, whereas IHC is a proper approach to detect the AKRs if the AKR antibodies are available.
Unfortunately, appropriate antibodies for IHC against the 7 AKRs are not yet commer- cially available.
So we developed the speciﬁc monoclonal anti- bodies against AKRs by using the full length or truncated recombinant AKRs as the antigens (Figure S2).
Appropriate monoclonal AKR antibodies were characterized based upon two criteria: 1) no cross reactions between any AKR recombi- nant proteins, and 2) single band appeared in Western blot against the cell lysate (Figure S2).
Quantitative AKR transcriptomes in hepatic cell lines  In all the hepatic cell lines, strong signals were detected for AKR mRNAs using real-time PCR with actin as the internal control in triplicate experiments, although the signal was rela- tively lower in L-02 for AKR1C4.
Figure 1 shows the relative transcript abundance of AKRs in each hepatic cell line.
It is readily noticed that the mRNA abundance of almost AKR members in HuH7 was dramatically higher than that in the other hepatic cell lines.
In human genome, AKR1A1 and AKR7A2 are located on chromosome (Chr) 1p, AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 are found on Chr 7q, while all the AKR1Cs are located on Chr10p.
The globally higher AKR transcription in HuH7 thus implies that there may occur abnormality in copy numbers of chromosomes in HuH7 cells (see character- ization of HuH7 in JCRB cell bank), at least for Chr 1, 7 and 10 where AKR genes are located.
Of the four hepatic can- cer cell lines examined in this study, only HuH7 exhibited the unique features of AKR mRNA abundance.
Therefore, we suspect that whether AKR expression in HuH7 is representa- tive for hepatic cancer is thus questionable in the ﬁeld.
The mRNA abundant proﬁles presented in Figure 1 indeed con- tained plentiful information regarding AKR expression status.
Except for HuH7, mRNA abundance for four AKRs remained relatively stable both in normal and tumor cell lines, following  Figure 1 Relative mRNA abundance of each AKR in hepatic cell lines by real-time PCR Relative mRNA abundance of each AKR was measured by real-time PCR in 5 hepatic cell lines, respectively (one relative normal cell line L-02, with four HCC cell lines HepG2, HuH7, BEL7402 and SMMC7721).
The 4Ct values of AKRs were normalized by those of housekeeping gene ACTB in respective cell lines.
The comparison of mRNA abundances of the AKRs was achieved by 244Ct method.

Therefore, mRNA abundance distribu- tion patterns for theses four AKRs in these cell lines are unlikely to bear any cancer characteristics.
However, the  mRNA abundance distribution of AKR1C displayed different patterns within the cell lines.
mRNA abundance of AKR1C1/ 1C2 was lower than that of AKR1C3 in L-02, HepG2 and BEL7402, while the relative mRNA abundance ratio of   234  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 230 240  Cancer tissues  Adjacent tissues  AKR1A1  AKR1B10  Figure 3 Distribution of AKR1A1 and AKR1B10 protein in HCC Totally, 55 pairs of HCC and their adjacent tissues were examined.
Shown here are representative images for AKR1A1 (upper panel) and AKR1B10 (lower panel).
Staining intensity of AKR1B10 in cancer regions was relative higher than that in adjacent tissues, whereas AKR1A1 exhibited the opposite trends.
All images were taken with 400  magniﬁcation.
AKR1C1/1C2 to AKR1C3 in SMMC7721 was in the opposite direction.
Moreover, mRNA abundance of AKR1C4 in all the tumor cell lines was signiﬁcantly higher than that in L-02.
Tak- ing all together, the transcriptional status of the AKR1C fam- ily members rather than that of AKR1A and AKR1B may have tumor-related signiﬁcance.
It is interesting to note that mRNA expression of AKR1B10 was remarkably high in HuH7 (more than 400 folds than that in L-02, P   0.05), even higher than that of AKR1B1.
AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 are lo- cated on Chr 7q35 and 7q33, respectively.
Whether the extre- mely abnormal expression of AKR1B10 could be associated with the chromosomal position during tumorigenesis remains to be further explored.
Quantitative AKR proteomes in hepatic cell lines  In most cells, the selected AKR peptides with the correspond- ing transitions generated high quality MRM signals, which were satisfactory for accurate quantiﬁcation based upon the mass differential tags for relative and absolute quantiﬁcation (mTRAQ) approach.
The corresponding peptide signals were  the AKR1C1/1C2 and AKR1C3 peptides  easily detected in L-02, HepG2 and SMMC7721 (Table S1).
However, we failed to acquire MRM signals of AKR1C1/ 1C2 and AKR1C3 in BEL7402 for unknown reasons, although mRNA abundance of AKR1C1/1C2 and AKR1C3 in BEL7402 was comparable to that in the other three cell lines.
Therefore, we suspect that some interference in the m/z range of in BEL7402 may block the generation of the corresponding tran- sitions.
Compared to the other cell lines, HuH7 still showed quite distinct features in AKR abundance.
In particular, the abundance for AK1B10 and AKR1C1/1C2 was increased sig- niﬁcantly compared to L-02 (P   0.05), while that in the other cell lines was decreased or remained unchanged.
The protein abundance of the other AKRs in HuH7, however, showed dif- ferent patterns from the abundance of their corresponding mRNAs.
Abundance of AKR mRNAs in HuH7 were globally higher than that in the other cell lines (Figure 1), whereas abundance of AKR1A1, AKR1B1 and AKR7A2 proteins in HuH7 had no signiﬁcant increase (Figure 2).
In these cells, what kind of changes in translation or protein degrada- tion might be responsible for AKR abundances remains a  Table 1  IHC results of human AKR monoclonal antibodies  AKR  AKR1A1  AKR1B10  AKR1C1/1C2  AKR1C3  AKR1C4  Tissue samples  Total No.

Furthermore, overexpression of AKR1B10 at both mRNA and protein levels in HuH7 raised two questions as to why the signals for tran- script and protein expression were so strong for AKR1B10 and what would be associated with such overexpression.
Abundance and AKR1B10 was similar in the hepatic cell lines examined except for HuH7.
On the other hand, AKR7A2 expression exhibited some cell-type dependence.
For instance, abundance of AKR7A2 in SMMC7721 was much higher than that in the other cell lines.
The distribution of the AKR1C protein abundance was correlated with the cell lines as well.
Relative abundance of AR1C1/1C2 to AKR1C3 showed different pat- terns in L-02, HepG2, HuH7 and SMMC7721.
The protein abundance of AKR1C4 in L-02 was obviously lower than that in the tumor cell lines, which is similar to the observation in the AKR1C4 mRNA abundance.
Therefore, if HuH7 is not con- sidered, the quantitative proteomics results support the conclu- sion that the abundance distribution of AKR1A and AKR1B demonstrates the similar pattern in L-02, HepG2, BEL7402 and SMMC7721, while abundance of AKR1C displays a tu- mor-associated pattern.
Evaluation of the AKR protein expression status in hepatic tissues  To speciﬁcally examine the expression of respective AKR proteins, we expressed and puriﬁed 14 recombinant AKR proteins (in full or partial sequences), which were used as antigens to generate antibodies against various AKRs.
In to- tal, ﬁve speciﬁc monoclonal AKR antibodies that were pre- S65, pared including AKR1A1 AKR1B10 S2, AKR1C1/1C2 S29, AKR1C3 S8 and AKR1C4 S34, were shown to be successful as IHC antibod-  laboratory,  our  in  ies.
We collected 55 HCC samples and 55 adjacent tissue (non-HCC) samples, which included 19 pairs of well-differen- tiated tissues, 15 pairs of medium-differentiated ones and 21 pairs of low-differentiated ones in the tissue samples, from HCC patients, each consisting of an HCC tumor samples and adjacent tissue samples.
IHC was performed for these samples using the aforementioned AKR antibodies.
Our re- sults demonstrated varied staining pattern in tissues with dif- ferent AKR antibodies (Figure 3).
Analysis of the 55 HCC and 55 non-HCC samples revealed that positive staining for AKR1A1 appeared in 32.7% of the HCC samples (18 sam- ples) examined and 58.2% of the non-HCC samples (32 sam- ples) (Table 1).
Similarly, we showed that AKR1B10 was detected in 67.3% (37 samples) of the tumor tissues and 41.8% of the non-HCC samples (23 samples).
Further statis- tical analysis indicated that differences in IHC signals for AKR1A1 and AKR1B10 between the tumor and adjacent tis- sues were signiﬁcant in these paired samples (P   0.05, Ta- ble 1), while no signiﬁcant difference was observed for AKR1C proteins (P   0.05, Table 1).
We then went further to detect whether the staining for AKR proteins was associ- ated with the differentiation states of HCC.
Our analysis showed that no signiﬁcant correlation was found for staining of AKR1A1 and AKR1C1 1C4 proteins and the differentia- tion stages (P   0.05, Table 2).
However, the heavy staining of AKR1B10 was signiﬁcantly associated with the differenti- ation states of HCC, due to the presence of the signiﬁcant correlation (P = 0.037, Table 2).
Although the controversial results obtained from the AKR measurements in cells and tissues were somewhat disappoint- ing, the data are still worthy of further investigation.
First of all, AKRs are important detoxiﬁcation enzymes in the liver and the relatively high abundances of AKRs are expected in the normal tissues are  liver.
IHC data in the adjacent   236  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 230 240  consistent with their important roles under normal conditions.
Thus, the high background expression of AKRs may set the obstacle to distinguishing small differences in AKRs between tumor and adjacent tissues with IHC.
Secondly, the sample collection may be another source of experimental errors.
How to get samples with a high percentage of tumor cells is al- ways challenging.
Thirdly, AKRs are expressed in many tis- sues, including connective tissue and vessels [37].
AKR detection in a relatively pure cell population (such as a cell line) is likely different from a mixed cell population (excised tissues).
Discussion  The technical obstacles in quantitative evaluation of AKR expression status were priority considerations when we initi- ated this project.
There are fewer technical challenges for quantitative measurement of AKR transcripts, since PCR products corresponding to the individual AKRs were satisfac- torily ampliﬁed with properly-designed primers and appropri- ate PCR conditions for quantiﬁcation.
In order to globally estimate AKR protein abundances, our laboratory has devel- oped an approach based upon antibody recognition [38].
Using Pan-AKR-P4, an antibody generated in our lab with high afﬁnity to all the mouse AKR proteins, for 2-DE immu- noblotting to examine the AKR abundances in mouse liver and kidney, our semi-quantitative data were in good agree- ment with other previous reports [39].
This technique is useful to evaluate the sum abundance of AKRs, nevertheless, it is useless for globally evaluating and comparing abundance of individual AKRs.
Importantly, antibody-based measurement of AKRs offers relative limited information in accurate quan- tiﬁcation.
In this study, we utilized the mTRAQ/MRM ap- proach to quantitatively measure the absolute abundances of the individual AKRs in hepatic cell lines.
MRM measurement of AKRs in these hepatic cell lines provided relatively accurate data in protein quantiﬁcation with the acceptable coefﬁcient of variation values (Figure 2).
The absolute quantiﬁcation of AKRs thus makes it possible to globally and quantitatively evaluate contribution of various AKRs to different cancer cell lines.
Taken together, both quantitative techniques were estab- lished to evaluate AKR expression status.
Importantly, such strategy of quantitative evaluation can be potentially applied to other protein families.
The quantitative data in this study revealed that  the AKR1C members are likely to be associated with hepatic tu- mor because abundance patterns of AKRs at either mRNA or protein levels were quite diverse among the cell lines exam- ined.
On the other hand, AKR1A and AKR1B appear to have a relatively stable abundance in these cell lines.
Functional plasticity of AKR1Cs highlights their ability to modulate the  levels of active hormones such as androgens, oestrogens and progestins [25,40 42].
For instance, 20-alpha-hydroxysteroid is an AKR1C1 substrate, while 3-alpha- and 17-beta-hydroxy- steroid are oxidized by AKR1C2, AKR1C3 and AKR1C4 [43].
Hormone-dependent tissues require local production of andro- gens and estrogens to stimulate cell proliferation [25].
Penning et al.
proposed that participation of AKR1Cs in conversion of hormones and their derivatives may stimulate the growth of hormone-dependent and -independent prostate and breast can- cer [25,44,45].
In addition, some investigators found that the AKR1Cs were correlated with hormone-independent malig- nancies [20,46].
Figueroa et al.
reported that overexpression of AKR1C3 was a high-risk factor in bladder cancer [47], while Hsu et al.
observed that AKR1C mRNAs were not detected in the normal lung tissues but were overexpressed in 47% of the patients with non-small cell [18].
Although many documents indicate that AKR1C proteins play some roles in tumorigenesis, involvement of AKR1C in liver cancer is still a new view in the ﬁeld.
There is lack of evidence in the literature to support this hypothesis.
IHC data generated from this study unfortunately did not provide supportive evi- dence to this hypothesis, due to the contradictory results with MRM data.
More experiments are necessary to solve this ca- veat, since the quantitative data were generated upon solid experimental bases, and cross validated at mRNA and protein levels in cell lines, we could not ﬁnd any reason to doubt about their accuracy.
One option is to conduct the parallel experi- ments to test the AKR expression status in the liver cells both in vitro and in vivo.
lung cancer (NSCLC)  Lafﬁn and Petrash examined expression of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 across all major human cancer types using database searching [48,49].
They found that AKR1B10 was signiﬁcantly overexpressed in cancers of lung and liver, while AKR1B1 was more broadly overexpressed in human cancers but with a gen- erally lower magnitude.
Abnormal expression of AKRlB10 was also detected in HuH7 cells and most HCC tissues.
A somewhat surprising result came from the quantitative data for AKR1B10 mRNA and protein in other cancer cell lines.
In contrast to extremely high abundance of AKR1B10 mRNA and protein in HuH7 cells, three other liver cancer lines, HepG2, BEL7402 and SMMC7721, possessed almost normal levels of AKR1B10 mRNA and protein.
More impressively, HuH7 cells showed global overexpression for most AKR genes, indicating that AKR1B10 overexpression is not a un- ique feature of tumorigenesis.
Our data in quantitative mRNA and protein of AKR1B10 therefore prompt two questions.
Is the HuH7 cell line more representative for liver cancer than other cancer cell lines  Is the AKR1B10 protein more stable in tissues or cells than other AKR members  No matter what the answer would be, the use of AKR1B10 for diagnosis and prognosis is of great potential interest and merits further inves- tigation in the future.
Table 3 Features of the ﬁve hepatic cell lines examined in this study  Cell line  Origin  Ethnicity/race  Age (years)  Gender  Diﬀerentiation degree  Morphology  L-02 HepG2 HuH7 SMMC7721 BEL7402  Liver HCC HCC HCC HCC  Chinese Caucasian Japanese Chinese Chinese    15 57 50 53    Male Male Male Male  Immortalized Well-medium diﬀerentiated Well diﬀerentiated Medium low diﬀerentiated Medium low diﬀerentiated  Epithelial Epithelial Epithelial Epithelial Epithelial   Yang L et al / AKR Proﬁling in HCC Cell Lines  237  Materials and methods  Cell lines and tissues  L-02, BEL7402 and SMMC7721 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% FBS at 37  C with 5% CO2.
HepG2 and HuH7 cells were cultured in DMEM medium plus 10% FBS at 37  C with 5% CO2.
L-02 is a relatively normal hepatic cell line, while the others are HCC cell lines characterized by various degrees of differentiation.
HepG2 and HuH7 are well-medium differentiated cell lines, while BEL7402 and SMMC7721 are medium low differentiated cell lines (Table 3).
Thirty two paired hepatic tissues of patients consisting of the HCC portions with their corresponding adjacent tissues and 10 unpaired ones were obtained from the Department of Oncology, General Hospital of PLA.
And 13 pairs of tissues were gifts from Xiaohang Zhao s lab in Cancer Institute and Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College.
Among them, 19 are well-dif- ferentiated ones, 15 are medium-differentiated ones and 21 are low-differentiated ones.
The study was approved by the Re- search Ethics Boards of General Hospital of PLA and Cancer Institute and Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College.
Informed consent forms were obtained from all patients.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis  Total RNAs were extracted from the ﬁve hepatic cell lines with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reversely transcribed to generate cDNA libraries using reverse transcrip- tase M-MLV (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Primers speciﬁc for respective AKR genes were designed using PrimerQuest software (IDT DNA, Coralville, IA, USA) and sequences of primers were listed in Table S2.
Transcript levels of AKRs in the aforementioned hepatic cell lines were quantitatively eval- uated using real-time PCR with an ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and EvaGreen dye (OPE Tech, Shanghai, China).
The ﬁrst step of cycling was 5 min at 95  C followed by 40 cycles of 95  C for 15 s, 60  C for 15 s, 72  C for 15 s and 80  C for 30 s, then 10 min at 72  C. The second step is dissociation stage, 95  C for 15 s, 60  C for 15 s and 95  C for 15 s. Tripli- cate cDNA template samples were ampliﬁed and analyzed.
All samples were tested three times.
Identity of all the real-time PCR products was veriﬁed by sequencing (Figure S1).
Cell harvest and protein extraction  The hepatic cells were harvested by trypsin treatment.
After rinsed with saline solution, cells were incubated with lysis buf- fer containing 8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA and 40 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.5).
After centrifugation at 20,000g for 20 min at 4  C, the supernatant was removed and used as protein sample for electrophoresis on 12% SDS PAGE gels.
Quantitative MRM analysis  Protein levels of AKRs in hepatic cell lines were quantiﬁed by MRM with QTRP 5500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,  USA) and unique peptides.
MRM pilot software (Applied Bio- systems) was used to design transitions of unique peptides.
The sequences of unique peptides and corresponding transitions are listed in Table S1.
We excised the bands at 34 42 KDa (about molecular weight of AKRs) to reduce the complexity of the samples.
These samples were processed for trypsin diges- tion, mTRAQ label and MRM analysis.
Antigen expression  PCR products were veriﬁed by sequencing analysis.
To pro- duce the recombinant proteins, AKR1C1 1C4 were ligated into pET30a(+) vectors, while the others were ligated into pET28a(+), all fused in frame with N-terminal 6  His.
Plas- mids containing respective AKR1 sequences were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression.
All the recombinant proteins were produced and puriﬁed with the Ni- NTA spin column as instructed by manufacturer (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands), which were used as antigens in full length or truncated fragments for antibody generation.
Generation and selection of monoclonal antibodies  four  times of  immunization,  BALB/c mice were used for immunization of the AKR recom- binant proteins.
After the splenocytes were isolated and fused with a hypoxanthin  aminopterin thymidine (HAT)-sensitive mouse myeloma cell line, SP2/0-Ag14, using polyethylene glycol method [50].
Hybridomas producing speciﬁc monoclonal antibody to AKRs were selected, ampliﬁed and then injected into enteroco- elia of mice.
Monoclonal antibody puriﬁcation was carried out by afﬁnity chromatography method.
Antibodies of IgG sub- class were puriﬁed on Protein G beads while antibodies of IgM and IgA subclasses were puriﬁed on Protein L beads [50].
ELISA experiments were designed to select the speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies of AKRs (BPI, Beijing, China) to avoid cross reaction between AKR members.
Each well was coated with 10 ng AKR recombinant proteins.
Speciﬁc antibodies should only recognize the corresponding antigen without any signal from the other AKRs.
Immunoblotting  Dot blotting analysis was performed to validate speciﬁcities and sensitivities of the respective monoclonal antibodies (Fig- ure S2A).
Protein concentration was determined by the Brad- ford method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Recombinant AKR proteins were dotted on PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) with increasing amounts (1, 10, 100 and 1000 ng).
Membranes were then blocked in 5% milk in 1  Tris-buffered saline Tween (TBST) overnight at 4  C and incu- bated with a speciﬁc primary antibody (listed below) in 5% milk for 1 h at 37  C. Blots were washed in 1  TBST three times before incubated with an anti mouse secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (ZB2305, ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) for 1 h at room temperature.
Finally, blots were washed and bands were visualized by the Image Quant ECL equipment (GE healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Primary antibodies against AKRs and the working concentrations are as follows: AKR1A1 S65 (1:700)  AKR1B1 S1 (1:700)  AKR1B10 S2 (1:8000)  AKR1C1/1C2 S8 (1:7000)  AKR1C4 S34 (1:1000) and AKR7A2 S3 (1:1000).
(1:10,000)  AKR1C3  S29   238  Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 11 (2013) 230 240  In addition, speciﬁcities of the monoclonal antibodies were also validated with Huh7 cell lysate following the standard protocols using the aforementioned antibodies (Figure S2B).
IHC  The protein levels of AKRs in the HCC samples and adjacent tissues from patients were examined using IHC.
Brieﬂy, tissue sections were mounted and baked at 65  C for 1 2 h. Sections were deparafﬁnized with xylene and re-hydrated in graded eth- anol.
Antigen retrieval was performed with 10 mM sodium cit- ric acid buffer (pH 6.0) at high pressure for 2.5 min.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the tissue sections with 3% H2O2 for 15 min.
Antibodies were diluted with the blocking buffer and incubation in a moist chamber at 4  C overnight.
After washing, the slides were trea- ted with ready to use secondary antibody (ZB2305) and incu- bated at 37  C for 25 min, followed by rinses with PBS.
DAB substrate was added to the slides and incubated at room tem- perature for less than 10 min.
Tissue sections were counter- stained lightly with hematoxylin.
Slides were dehydrated and sealed with neutral balsam for visualization by light micros- copy.
Primary antibodies against AKRs and the working con- centrations are as follows: AKR1A1 S65 (1:500)  AKR1B10 S2 (1:10,000)  AKR1C1/1C2 S29 (1:10,000)  AKR1C3 S8 (1:5000) and AKR1C4 S34 (1:200).
The staining was scored as negative (if  5% cells were stained in a ﬁeld examined) or positive (if P5% cells were stained in a ﬁeld examined) by pathologists and research scientists independently.
Statistical analysis  Results are presented as the mean   standard error.
Statistical signiﬁcance was set at P   0.05.
For real-time PCR, the Ct values of housekeeping gene b-actin were adopted to normalize the expression of AKRs.
The comparison of mRNA levels be- tween the cell lines was achieved on the basis of the relative 44Ct method [51].
values of gene expression calculated by 2 One-way ANOVA and 2-way ANOVA were used for statisti- cal analysis.
For MRM, t test was used to determine P values between samples.
And for IHC, statistical analysis was carried out by Pearson v2 test.
