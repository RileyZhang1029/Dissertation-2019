Abstract
The Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) was established in 2000 by the National Institutes of General
Medical Sciences with the long-term goal of providing 3D (three-dimensional) structural information
for most proteins in nature. As advances in genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, homology modelling,
and methods for rapid determination of 3D structures of proteins by X-ray crystallography and
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) converged, it was proposed that our understanding of the biology
of protein structure and evolution could be greatly enabled by ‘genomic-scale’ protein structure
determination. Over the past 12 years, the PSI has evolved from a testing bed for new methods of
sample and structure production to a core component of a wide range of biology programs.

Introduction
The vision of the PSI is to make 3D protein structure
information an integral part of biology research.
Structural Genomics has the potential
to transform
biomedical research, creating a powerful new infrastruc-
ture capable of addressing some of the most challenging
molecular problems of modern biology. Large-scale
genome sequencing efforts have provided new insights
into the richness and diversity of life, and the genomic
bases of evolution and function. However, natural
selection is largely driven by the physical properties of
the 3D protein structure. A complete understanding of
protein function and evolution, thus, requires informa-
tion about both protein sequence and 3D structure [1,2].
The PSI has developed over three phases: the first phase
(from 2000-2001) was a pilot phase to test the feasibility
and develop the methodology; the second phase was to
solve large numbers of structures using insights from the
first phase; and the third phase, PSI:Biology, aims to
expand the role of the 3D structure in biological research
using advances from the first
In this
commentary, I summarize some of the achievements of
the PSI and the vision for expanding these in the new

two phases.

Institute of General Medical Science PSI:

Major recent advances
Several recent reviews have outlined the progress and
achievements of the PSI program [3-9]. Ultimately, the
success of
the initiative will be determined by the
scientific impact of the new technologies, reagents, and
3D structures provided into the public domain, and the
knowledge that is gained from these data. One operational
metric of the program is a count of 3D structures of
‘distinct’ proteins (or domains), referred to as ‘Distinct
Structures’, deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
Two protein sequences are ‘distinct’ if they share < 98%
sequence identity over the full-length of the shortest
sequence of the pair, e.g. though each provides uniquely
valuable information, two crystal structures of the same
protein bound to different ligands count as a single
Distinct Structure. “Novel” structures are defined as those
which have < 30% sequence identity with any structure in
the PDB at the time of deposition. In the second phase of
the PSI program (called PSI2, 2005-2010), investigators
achieved their goal set in 2005 of depositing more than

F1000 Biology Reports 2012, 4:7

http://f1000.com/reports/b/4/7

3,000 Distinct Structures into the PDB. Most of these were
also Novel Structures, greatly expanding our knowledge
of the relationship between protein sequences and 3D
structure. Over the full ten years of the PSI program,
investigators completed and deposited into the public
domain more than 5,000 3D protein structures, including
protein-ligand complexes and pairs of X-ray and NMR
structures which, though not counted as “Distinct”, have
important scientific value (see for example [10]).

Many of the structures determined in first and second
phases of the PSI program were, at the time of deposition
into the PDB, the first representatives from extensive
protein domain families [11]. A ‘protein domain family’
is a set of homologous protein domains likely to have
similar structures and possibly similar biochemical
functions. These included both domains with known
biochemical functions and domains of unknown func-
tion, known as DUFs. These structures are being used as
templates for modelling tens of thousands of homo-
logous proteins [12-17] and provide a database of
protein sequences, structures, and biophysical properties
(e.g. chemical shifts) that also inform the fields of
protein structure prediction, design, and engineering. By
focusing the choice of targets on proteins that have
minimal sequence similarity with known structures, PSI
structures have greatly increased the size of the non-
redundant protein structure knowledge base that is being
used to develop improved structure prediction algo-
rithms, including fragment-based search algorithms and
knowledge-based atomic potentials. In some cases, these
structural data are accompanied by extensive chemical
shift, nuclear overhauser effect (NOE), and other NMR
data that are being used in hybrid structure determina-
tion methods [18].

The PSI has also become the primary contributor of
structural data that can be used for testing new methods
for protein structure prediction and automated data
analysis, including data used in such projects as the
Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction [19,20] and the
Critical Assessment of Automated Structure Determina-
tion of Proteins from NMR data [21]. Structural Genomics
projects are unique as they can provide their data for
community-wide tests of computational methods without
concern regarding how it impacts their priorities for
publishing a particular structure. PSI Centers are also
involved in collaborative projects aimed at accelerating
the field of protein NMR structure analysis [22-28] and
computational protein design [29-31].

As part of the community-outreach goals of the PSI
program,
Institute of General Medical
Science has created the PSI Structural Biology Knowledge

the National

Base (PSI-SBKB) [32], for organizing and disseminating
the entire repertoire of scientific information generated
by the PSI program, and the PSI Materials Repository
(PSI-MR) [33], designed to provide easy, rapid, and broad
access to the biochemical reagents produced by PSI
Centers, particularly the protein expression systems.
These resources serve as a platform for PSI-funded
investigators to provide information on protein samples
and 3D structures to the broad biological community in
an “open source” fashion, in which intermediate results,
protein expression systems and protocols, protein struc-
tures, and new technologies are made available to the
community as soon as the data and/or methods are
deemed to be reliable. The PSI-SBKB also provides access
to 3D protein models generated using various compara-
tive modeling methods [14], together with coordinates of
structures solved by the PSI program.

The PSI program has also instituted a Community
Nomination Target (CNT) program, through which
scientists can nominate targets for study by PSI centers
and collaborate on functional follow on studies (http://
sbkb.org/cnt/). This program provides a unique method
of connecting PSI investigators with important biologi-
cal problems and top-tier biological investigators and
provides access to PSI Centers by a wide range of
collaborators who are not directly funded by the PSI.
Several of these CNT projects have yielded important
and challenging structures enabling the research pro-
grams of individual investigators across the globe (see
for example [34-42]).

Future directions: a vision for Structural
Genomics in PSI:Biology
The successful demonstration of the feasibility of ‘high-
throughput structure production’ opens doors to a wide
range of new opportunities for biological research that
could not be considered without such infrastructure. The
third phase of the PSI program, PSI:Biology, aims to
expand the role of 3D structure in biological research by
supporting several “high-throughput-enabled biology
partnerships”, designed to leverage the protein sample
and structure production horsepower of the PSI High-
Throughput Production Centers in applications involving
broad and/or challenging biological questions. Examples
of project areas that are emphasized in the PSI:Biology
program include the following:

(a) Metagenomics and microbiomes. Providing one or a
few representative 3D structures from the largest
protein domain families from ecosystems of organ-
isms (e.g. the human gut microbiome) that are being
characterized by large-scale metagenomic sequen-
cing projects.

http://f1000.com/reports/b/4/7

(b) Individual organisms or organelles. Structural Geno-
mics platforms are providing extensive structural
coverage of proteins from a specific organisms, such
as Thermatoga maritima [43] and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis [44], or proteins from organelles, such as
mitochondria [45] or nuclear pore complexes [46].

(c) Systems biology: networks, pathways, and com-
plexes. Structural Genomics platforms are being
directed to provide hundreds of experimental
structures and high-quality homology models of
proteins and protein complexes involved in co-
functioning networks, metabolic systems, such as
networks of interacting proteins involved in cancer
biology [47], and specific biochemical pathways,
such as biosynthetic pathways [48-50].

(d) Individual protein domain families. Structural
Genomics platforms are providing (i) extensive,
fine-grained structural coverage of particular protein
domain families in order to understand the atomic
details of structure-function relationships, (ii) stu-
dies of ligand binding affinities aimed at under-
standing the rules of molecular recognition, and
(iii) studies of the relationships between structure,
function, and internal dynamics across an extensive
enzyme family.

(e) Protein engineering and design. Structural Genomics
platforms are being applied to validate de novo
protein designs,
to discover new principles for
protein engineering, and to illuminate mechanisms
for altering enzyme specificity and chemistry.

These exciting applications provide a vision of the broad
impact Structural Genomics platforms and technologies
will have on biological and biomedical research.
Examples of key areas that are being explored in the
PSI:Biology program are outlined in the following three
sections.

The role of Structural Genomics in functional genomics
and systems biology
Structural Genomics provides 3D atomic-resolution
structural information of large numbers of gene products
(so far, primarily proteins) and, thus, lays the foundation
required for systems biology. For example, having protein
samples, affinity capture reagents (e.g. phage display
antibodies), and complete 3D structural descriptions of
the enzymes and protein-protein complexes associated
with a specific biological process, such as epigenetically-
regulated gene expression or protein translation, will open
new avenues to model and understand such complex

biological systems. Such a comprehensive view would
also allow improved diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

Structural Genomics of protein complexes
Most proteins function by forming complexes. Indeed,
some proteins are simply not folded in the absence of
their macromolecular and/or small molecule partners.
Genomes encode large numbers of natively disordered
proteins or protein regions that are functionally impor-
tant for protein-protein interactions, modulating bind-
ing affinities, and regulating signaling pathways [51-55].
This has been born out by biophysical studies on thousands
of proteins expressed and purified in the PSI program,
demonstrating that a large portion of the eukaryotic
proteome codes for intrinsically disordered proteins and/
or protein regions. In recent years, research groups of the PSI
have begun to address such disordered regions of proteins
(or entire intrinsically-disordered protein families), parti-
cularly those that become ordered upon complex forma-
tion [56].
technological goals include
development of high-throughput methods for protein co-
expression, crystallization-enhancing chaperones generated
by phage display methods [57,58], and various technolo-
gies for identifying, co-expressing, and forming complexes
between proteins, including those that involve disorder-
order transitions.

Important

Structural Genomics of membrane proteins
Membrane proteins remain a major challenge to structural
biology. However, our understanding of biology will not
be complete without extensive structural information on
integral membrane proteins. Structural genomics pipe-
lines, involving coordinated teams of scientists working
together with shared resources and infrastructure (e.g.
[59-61]), have the potential to make major breakthroughs
in creating new technologies and protocols for determin-
ing 3D structures and dynamics of integral membrane
proteins. Some important integral membrane protein
structures, including several G protein-coupled receptors,
known as GPCRs, and their complexes with ligands, have
recently been determined in PSI-funded projects using
both X-ray crystallography [62-71] and NMR spectroscopy
[72,73]. In the PSI:Biology program, expanded support
is provided for the technology development needed
for membrane protein sample production, coordinated,
project-wide structural analysis of human integral mem-
brane proteins, and community-nominated studies of
membrane protein structure and function.

Cooperation between PSI centers
One of the unique features of the PSI program is the
extensive cooperation and synergy between potentially
competing National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded
centers. For example, in the second phase of the PSI

program, target selection of proteins for structure deter-
mination was coordinated by a BioInformatics Group
committee that included members from each of the
computational biology teams associated with the four
Large Scale Centers [11]. The successful collaboration of
the different teams resulted not only in more rational and
comprehensive target selection but also minimized
duplications of effort by providing coordination among
hundreds of scientists and synergies that would not be
possible in smaller
laboratory research
projects.

individual

Challenges for PSI:Biology
The third phase of the PSI program, PSI:Biology, is an
experiment in large-scale biological research. Preliminary
progress using large-scale 3D protein structure production
to enable biological research partnerships is very exciting.
The program currently consists of four Centers for High-
Throughput Structure Determination, nine Centers for
Membrane Protein Structure Determination, 12 High-
Throughput Enabled Biology Partners, and two Resource
Centers (the PSI-SBKB and PSI-MR). In addition, several
of these centers host extensive CNT projects, involving
many research groups that are not directly funded by
the PSI:Biology program. These CNT projects have the
potential to create new and unexpected uses of protein
structure, and to enable, with 3D protein structures, a
wide range of biological and biochemical studies.

A challenge faced by the PSI:Biology program is to create
strong cooperation and synergies among the 27 PSI:Biology
centers, each of which is itself a multi-investigator team, as
well between the PSI:Biology centers and individual
investigators associated with the CNT programs. Such an
integrated program will be a unique engine for biological
discovery. Obviously,
issues may arise within such a
research network that require innovative thinking and
creative management. A model for this integration is the
cooperation and synergy achieved between the Large Scale
Centers. Despite challenges that may present themselves in
the early phases of the program, the power of such a unique,
integrated infrastructure for biological research has the
potential to rapidly advance biology and biomedical
science.

Conclusions
The PSI program provides a novel paradigm for biological
science discovery. Rather than determining 3D structures
as a means for testing specific hypotheses, the Structural
Genomics approach aims to discover new science by
analyzing the information provided by 3D structures,
sometimes even before the biological significance of
the protein is recognized. It has been a powerful and
successful driving force for a wide range of method

developments that have been realized only by collecting
homogeneous, fully-documented data across large num-
bers of protein samples and structures (see for example
[10,21,26,74-81]). The PSI has also provided a test bed
for “network biological science”, enabling discovery
through cooperative interactions across a network of
collaborating scientists. The unique multi-laboratory
structure of the PSI “centers” also provides a model of
how the internet can be used to integrate research activities
across a network of real time collaborations. This paradigm
is making significant contributions to biology, utilizing the
high-throughput platforms developed in the PSI program
to enable biology with 3D structural information. Indeed,
the concerted effort of the more than 500 scientists
participating in the PSI:Biology program has the potential
to revolutionize the utility and impact of protein 3D
structure information for the broad biological community.
