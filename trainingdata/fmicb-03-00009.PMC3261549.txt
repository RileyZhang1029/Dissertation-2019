Escherichia coli represents an incredible versatile and diverse enterobacterial species
and can be subdivided into the following; (i) intestinal non-pathogenic, commensal iso-
lates. (ii) Intestinal pathogenic isolates and (iii) extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli or ExPEC
isolates. The presence to several putative virulence genes has been positively linked
with the pathogenicity of ExPEC. E. coli remains one of the most frequent causes of
nosocomial and community-acquired bacterial infections including urinary tract infections,
enteric infections, and systemic infections in humans. ExPEC has emerged in 2000s as
an important player in the resistance to antibiotics including the cephalosporins and ﬂu-
oroquinolones. Most importantly among ExPEC is the increasing recognition of isolates
producing “newer β-lactamases” that consists of plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases
(e.g., CMY), extended-spectrum β-lactamases (e.g., CTX-M), and carbapenemases (e.g.,
NDM). This review will highlight aspects of virulence associated with ExPEC, provide a
brief overview of plasmid-mediated resistance to β-lactams including the characteristics
of the successful international sequence types such as ST38, ST131, ST405, and ST648
among ExPEC.

Keywords: Escherichia coli, virulence, antimicrobial resistance

INTRODUCTION
Escherichia coli is an important cause of urinary tract infections
(UTIs), enteric infections, and systemic infections in humans
(Mandell et al., 2005). The systemic infections include bacteremia,
nosocomial pneumonia, cholecystitis, cholangitis, peritonitis, cel-
lulitis, osteomyelitis, and infectious arthritis. E. coli is also leading
cause of neonatal meningitis.

Escherichia coli comprises of non-pathogenic commensal iso-
lates that forms part of the normal ﬂora of humans and vari-
ous animals (Kaper et al., 2004). However, several variants have
been described that cause infection of the gastrointestinal sys-
tem (intestinal pathogenic E. coli) while others cause infections
outside the gastrointestinal system (extraintestinal pathogenic E.
coli or ExPEC). ExPEC incorporates the following variants; avian
pathogenic E. coli, uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), and those iso-
lates responsible for septicemia and neonatal meningitis (Kaper
et al., 2004).

Uropathogenic E. coli are the primary causes of community-
acquired UTIs with an estimated 20% of women over the age of
18 years suffering from at least one UTI in their lifetime (Foxman,
2010). UPEC is responsible for 70–95% of community-onset UTIs
and approximately 50% of nosocomial UTIs, hence accounting for
substantial morbidity, mortality, and medical expenses. Recurrent
or relapsing UTIs are especially problematic in many individu-
als. The primary reservoir of UPEC is believed to be the human
intestinal tract and employ diverse repertoire of virulence factors
to colonize and infect the urinary tract in an ascending fashion
(Foxman, 2010). However, community-onset clonal outbreaks of

UTIs, possibly due to the consumption of food contaminated with
UPEC have also been described (Wiles et al., 2008). Additionally,
there is some evidence that UPEC isolates can also be transmitted
via sexual activities (Wiles et al., 2008).

The aim of this article is to highlight aspects of virulence
associated with ExPEC, to provide a brief overview of the most
important plasmid-mediated resistance to β-lactams including the
characteristics of international sequence types among ExPEC.

GENOMICS AND VIRULENCE FACTORS
Virulence factors involve mechanisms that enable pathogenic bac-
teria to cause infections. Genomics offers an interesting tool for
deﬁning virulence factors; it can be used to identify genes encod-
ing for speciﬁc factors that contributes to virulence in pathogens.
However, the presence of a single factor rarely makes an organism
virulent; a combination of factors will determine if a bacterium
can cause infection (Dobrindt, 2005). Moreover, the determining
factor is not simply the presence or absence of virulence-associated
genes, but also their levels of expression, which can vary between
pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates.

The E. coli genome is composed of a conserved core of genes
that provides the backbone of genetic information required for
essential cellular processes and a ﬂexible gene pool that har-
bors genetic information which provides properties that enables
the bacterium to adapt to special environmental conditions
(Dobrindt, 2005). The size of the ﬂexible gene pool is determined
by the acquisition and loss of genomic DNA. The parallel gain
and loss of mobile genetic elements in the ﬂexible portion of

the gene pool such as bacteriophages, plasmids, genomic islands,
transposons, insertion elements enabled the evolution of separate
clones of E. coli (Dobrindt, 2005). A portion of the ﬂexible gene
pool consists of accessory genetic elements (including plasmids,
transposons, insertion elements, prophages, and genomic islands),
that can be either integrated into the chromosome or replicate
independently as extrachromosomal elements. These elements
can be laterally transferred to other species thus contributing to
inter-, intra-species variability in genomic contents (Dobrindt,
2005).

The presence to several putative virulence genes has been posi-
tively linked with the pathogenicity of ExPEC. Phylogenetic analy-
ses have shown that intestinal E. coli and ExPEC falls into four
main phylogenetic groups namely A, B1, B2, and D (Herzer et al.,
1990). ExPEC belongs mainly to group B2 and, to a lesser extent,
to group D while intestinal commensal isolates tend to belong
to groups A and B1. ExPEC isolates exhibit considerable genome
diversity and possess a broad range of virulence-associated factors
including toxins, adhesions, lipopolysaccharides, polysaccharide
capsules, proteases, and invasins that are frequently encoded by
pathogenic islands and other mobile DNA islands (Table 1). It
seems that these putative virulence factors contribute to ﬁtness
(e.g., iron-uptake systems, bacteriocins, proteases, adhesins) of
ExPEC and increase the adaptability, competitiveness, and abil-
ity to colonize the human body rather than being typical virulence
factors directly involved in infection (Mokady et al., 2005).

Whether a commensal E. coli will develop into ExPEC requires
the presence of functional genes directly contributing to patho-
genesis and certain putative factors enabling the successful col-
onization of the host that enhances ﬁtness and adaptation of
the bacterium to its surroundings. This highlights the thin line
between “virulence” and “ﬁtness” and “colonization” factors in the
deﬁnition of ExPEC virulence factors.

ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE IN ESCHERICHIA COLI
The management of infections caused by ExPEC has been compli-
cated by the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, especially since
the late 1990s (Pitout and Laupland, 2008). The cephalosporins,
ﬂuoroquinolones, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole are often
used to treat community and hospital infections caused by E.
coli and resistance to these agents is responsible for delays in
appropriate therapy with subsequently increasing morbidity and
mortality (Lautenbach et al., 2001; Tumbarello et al., 2007).
Until the late 1990s ExPEC were relatively susceptible to ﬁrst
line antibiotics, however several surveillance studies during the
2000s across Europe, North and South America have shown
that between 20 and 45% of ExPEC are resistant to ﬁrst line
antibiotics including the cephalosporins, ﬂuoroquinolones, and
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (Foxman, 2010).

RESISTANCE TO β-LACTAMS
β-Lactam antibiotics, especially the third generation cephalosporins,
are a major drug class used to treat serious community-onset
or hospital-acquired infections caused by E. coli (Livermore and
Woodford, 2006). Among E. coli, β-lactamase production remains
the most important mediator of β-lactam resistance. β-lactamases
are bacterial enzymes that inactivate β-lactam antibiotics by

Most importantly is the increasing numbers of ExPEC iso-
lates producing “newer β-lactamases” that includes the plasmid-
mediated AmpC β-lactamases (e.g., CMY types), extended-
spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL; e.g., CTX-M types), and car-
bapenemases. The carbapenemases consists of three important
classes; the class A (e.g., KPC types), the class B or metallo-
β-lactamases (MBLs), and class D or OXA types (Jacoby and
Munoz-Price, 2005). CMY-2, CTX-Ms, and NDM types of β-
lactamase are mostly responsible for the emerging resistance to the
β-lactam antibiotics in E. coli. The characteristics of these newer
β-lactamases including the KPC and OXA types are summarized
in Table 2. Various carbapenemases including VIM, IPM, KPC,
and OXA-48 β-lactamases have been described in members of the

are less common among E. coli and will not be addressed in this
review. It is therefore important to remember that in certain areas
of the world, KPC and OXA-48-producing E. coli can be important
causes of carbapenem resistance.

EXTENDED-SPECTRUM β-LACTAMASES
The most well known of the “newer” β-lactamases was ﬁrst
described in 1983 and have been named the ESBLs. These enzymes
have the ability to hydrolyse the penicillins, cephalosporins, and
monobactams, but not the cephamycins and carbapenems, and are
inhibited by “classical” β-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic
acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam (Paterson and Bonomo, 2005).
Although ESBLs have been identiﬁed in a range of Enterobacteri-
aceae, they are most often present in E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The
majority of ESBLs identiﬁed in clinical isolates during the 1980s–
1990s were the SHV or TEM types, which evolved from parent
enzymes such as TEM-1, -2, and SHV-1 (Paterson and Bonomo,
2005). A different type of ESBL, named CTX-M β-lactamases, orig-
inated from environmental Kluyvera spp., and gained prominence
in the 2000s with reports of clinical isolates of E. coli produc-
ing these enzymes from Europe, Africa, Asia, South and North
America (Canton and Coque, 2006). Since the mid 2000s CTX-
M β-lactamases had been identiﬁed in different members of the
Enterobacteriaceae, but especially in E. coli, and have become the
most widespread and common type of ESBL (Pitout and Laupland,
2008).

CTX-M-producing E. coli are important causes of community-
onset UTIs, bacteremia and intra-abdominal infections (Can-
ton and Coque, 2006). Risk factors associated with infections
caused by CTX-M-producing E. coli include the following: repeat
UTIs, underlying renal pathology, previous antibiotics including

cephalosporins and ﬂuoroquinolones, previous hospitalization,
nursing home residents, older males and females, Diabetes Mel-
litus, underlying liver pathology, and international travel to high
risk areas such as the Indian subcontinent (Rodriguez-Bano and
Pascual, 2008). There are geographic variations in the prevalence
of ExPEC that produce CTX-Ms. Surveys from several coun-
tries worldwide have illustrated an alarming trend of associated
resistance to other classes of antimicrobial agents among CTX-M-
producing E. coli that included trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole,
tetracycline, gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciproﬂoxacin (Pitout
and Laupland, 2008).

Currently, the most widespread and prevalent type of CTX-M
enzyme among human clinical isolates of E. coli is CTX-M-15.
ExPEC producing this enzyme often belong to the international
uropathogenic sequence type named ST131 and to a lesser extend
ST38, ST405, and ST648 (Peirano and Pitout, 2010). It seems
that the intercontinental dissemination of these sequence types
have in part contributed to the worldwide emergence of CTX-
M-15 producing E. coli. ST131 with CTX-M-β-lactamases when
compared to other ESBL-producing E. coli was more likely to be
resistant to antibiotics, to produce the aminoglycoside modifying
(cid:2)
enzyme aac(6
)-Ib-cr, and cause community-acquired infections
including urosepsis (Pitout et al., 2009). ST131 is not a single
entity and can be subdivided into different clusters by other typ-
ing methods such as pulsed-ﬁeld electrophoresis (Peirano et al.,
2011a). It is therefore possible that variants of ST131 may differ
in virulence proﬁles and ability to spread. The global distribu-
tion of ST131 cam also reﬂects repeated selection of local variants
that have acquired certain resistance plasmids. A recent study
from Canada showed that investigated the molecular epidemiol-
ogy of ESBLs-producing E. coli causing bacteremia over an 11-year
period (2000–2010) showed that ST131 was the most common

ExPEC; virulence and resistance

and antimicrobial resistant sequence type and the inﬂux of a sin-
gle pulsotype of ST131 was responsible for a signiﬁcant increase
of ESBL-producing E. coli especially since 2007 (Peirano et al.,
2011a).

Johnson et al. (2009) gave some insight into the origin
of ST131 in North America. They studied 199 trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole-resistant and ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant E. coli
isolated from urines in Canada during 2002–2004 and identiﬁed
ST131 in 23% of isolates and nearly all were ﬂuoroquinolone-
resistant (i.e., 99%) but, notably, remained susceptible to the
cephalosporins (i.e., only 2% of ST131 in that study were resis-
tant to the cephalosporins; Johnson et al., 2009). Another study by
Johnson et al. (2010) investigated the presence and virulence prop-
erties of ST131 among 127 ExPEC E. coli from the 2007 SENTRY
and meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection
(MYSTIC) surveillance programs across the United States. Overall
54 (i.e., 17%) belonged to ST131, but interestingly this sequence
type included 52% of isolates that showed resistance to≥3 antimi-
crobial classes. ST131 has a signiﬁcant higher virulence score that
other ExPEC and certain virulence factors such as uropathogenic-
speciﬁc protein (usp); outer membrane protein (ompT); secreted
autotransporter toxin (sat ), aerobactin receptor (iutA), and patho-
genicity island marker (malX ) were associated with this sequence
type. Their results showed that ST131 had distinctive virulence
and resistance proﬁles and concluded that the combination of
antimicrobial resistance and virulence may be responsible for the
epidemiological success of this sequence type.

Studies have recently identiﬁed different sequence types such as
ST38, ST405, and ST648 among CTX-M-producing E. coli. ST38
with CTX-M-9, -14, and -15 has previously been described in
clinical isolates from Japan (Suzuki et al., 2009), the Netherlands
(van der Bij et al., 2011), Korea (Kim et al., 2011), and Tanzania
(Mshana et al., 2011). This sequence type is also associated with
OXA-48 (Poirel et al., 2011) and NDM-1 (Yamamoto et al., 2011).
ST405 with various types of CTX-Ms has a worldwide distribution
(Coque et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2008; Mihaila et al., 2010; Smet
et al., 2010) while ST648 with CTX-M-15, -32 are present in poul-
try from Spain (Cortes et al., 2010) and humans in China (Zong
and Yu, 2010) and the Netherlands (van der Bij et al., 2011). ST405
and ST648 are also associated with NDM β-lactamases (Hornsey
et al., 2011; Mushtaq et al., 2011). These reports suggest that they
might also play a role in the worldwide distribution and success of
CTX-M-producing E. coli.

It is evident today that CTX-M-producing E. coli is a major
player in the world of antimicrobial resistance. A report from the
Infectious Diseases Society of America listed ESBL-producing E.
coli as a priority drug-resistant microbe to which new therapies
are urgently needed (Talbot et al., 2006).

PLASMID-MEDIATED AmpC β-LACTAMASES
Escherichia coli possess a chromosomal gene that encodes for an
AmpC β-lactamase. Usually, low amounts of this β-lactamases
are produced because the AmpC gene is regulated by a weak
promoter and a strong attenuator (Olsson et al., 1982). Occa-
sionally, cephamycin-resistant strains produce plasmid-mediated
β-lactamases derived from bacteria with chromosomally encoded,
AmpC-cephalosporinases such as Enterobacter, Citrobacter feundii,

Morganella morganii, Aeromonas spp., and Hafnia alvei (Philip-
pon et al., 2002). These β-lactamases at high levels, hydrolyse
penicillins, most cephalosporins, cephamycins, and monobac-
tams, but not the fourth generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefepime)
and carbapenems. AmpC enzymes are not inhibited by “classi-
cal” β-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and
tazobactam although boronic acids and cloxacillin have shown to
be good inhibitors (Doi and Paterson, 2007).

Just like ESBL-producing bacteria, organisms with plasmid-
mediated AmpC enzymes have mostly been responsible for noso-
comial outbreaks on a worldwide basis during the late 1980s and
1990s, although the risk factors associated with infection are not
as well deﬁned as those associated with ESBL-producing bacteria
(Philippon et al., 2002). In a study reported from Korea, patients
infected by plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing organisms had
similar clinical features and outcomes to those patients infected
with TEM- or SHV-related ESBL producers (Pai et al., 2004).

The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program in the USA
found plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases in 2% of 1429 E. coli
isolates from 30 centers; with CMY-2, FOX-5, and DHA-1 being
identiﬁed (Deshpande et al., 2006). A UK study found acquired
cephamycinases in 49% of cefoxitin-resistant E. coli (Woodford
et al., 2007).

It seems that CMY-2, derived ancestrally from Citrobacter spp.,
is the most common plasmid-mediated cephamycinase reported
in E. coli from different areas of the world. Recent hospital sur-
veys from Asia, North America, and Europe have shown that the
CMY types are present in E. coli from Asia, North America, and
Europe (Alvarez et al., 2004; Mulvey et al., 2005; Moland et al.,
2006; Woodford et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008). A population-based
study conducted in Calgary, concluded that in this large Canadian
region, CMY-2-producing E. coli is an emerging pathogen in the
community that commonly causes UTIs in older women (Pitout
et al., 2007). This was followed by two reports from Washington
and Nebraska which showed Enterobacteriaceae producing CMY,
ACC, and DHA types of AmpC β-lactamases are present in clinical
isolates from outpatient clinics in the USA (Hanson et al., 2008;
Qin et al., 2008).

METALLO-β-LACTAMASES (NDM-1)
Recently, a new type of MBL, named NDM, was described in K.
pneumoniae and E. coli recovered from a Swedish patient who
was hospitalized in New Delhi, India (Yong et al., 2009). MBLs
have the ability to hydrolyse a wide variety of β-lactams, includ-
ing the penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, but not the
monobactams (i.e., aztreonam), and are inhibited by metal chela-
tors such as EDTA (Table 2). The majority of NDM-1-producing
bacteria are broadly resistant to various drug classes and also
carry a diversity of other resistance mechanisms (e.g., to amino-
glycosides and ﬂuoroquinolones), which leaves limited treatment
options (Nordmann et al., 2011a).

Kumarasamy et al. (2010), provide compelling evidence that
NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae (mostly K. pneumoniae and
E. coli) are widespread in India and Pakistan. They also found
that many UK patients infected with NDM-producing bacteria
had recently traveled to India to undergo several types of med-
ical procedures. The patients presented with a variety of hospital-

and community-associated infections with UTIs being the most
common clinical syndrome. Recent reports from the subconti-
nent (including India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) show that the
distribution of NDM β-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae are
widespread through these countries (Castanheira et al., 2011a,b;
Lascols et al., 2011): e.g., a hospital in Varanasi in Northern India
identiﬁed NDM-1 prevalence rate of 6% among E. coli (n= 528)
from outpatients and hospitalized patients between February 2010
and July 2010 (Seema et al., 2011), 7% among E. coli from a major
hospital in Mumbai, India (Deshpande et al., 2010), whereas 15%
(30/200) of in- and outpatients in Rawalpindi, Pakistan carried E.
coli with NDM-1 in their gut ﬂora (Perry et al., 2011).

Since mid-August 2010, NDM-1-positive bacteria have been
reported worldwide, except in Central and South America (Nord-
mann et al., 2011b). Most are Enterobacteriaceae from patients
hospitalized in 2009 and 2010 with an epidemiological link to
the Indian subcontinent. Recent ﬁndings suggest that the Balkan
states and the Middle East might act as secondary reservoirs
for the spread of NDM-1, which may or may not initially have
reached these countries from the Indian subcontinent. Enterobac-
teriaceae with NDM-1 have been recovered from many clinical set-
tings, reﬂecting the disease spectra of these opportunistic bacteria,
including hospital and community-onset UTIs, septicemia, pul-
monary infections, peritonitis, device-associated infections, and
soft tissue infections (Castanheira et al., 2011a; Nordmann et al.,
2011a,b). NDM-1-positive bacteria have been recovered from the
gut ﬂora of travelers returning from the Indian subcontinent and
undergoing microbiological investigation for unrelated diarrheal
symptoms (Leverstein-Van Hall et al., 2010). There is also wide-
spread environmental contamination by NDM-1-positive bacteria
in New Delhi (Walsh et al., 2011).

There is no evidence that E. coli that produce NDM are more
virulent than other isolates, however recent studies described pres-
ence of NDM β-lactamases in the very successful E. coli sequence
type ST131 with an identical virulence genotype than ST131 that
produce CTX-M β-lactamases (Peirano et al., 2011b). Of interest,

ST131 with VIM and KPC carbapenemases have also recently been
described (Mantengoli et al., 2011; Morris et al., 2011). Due to the
very resistant nature of these NDM-producing E. coli, the treat-
ment of infections due to these bacteria will remain a challenge to
physicians. Antibiotics such as colistin, tigecycline, and fosfomycin
show the best activity against NDM-producing bacteria (Nord-
mann et al., 2011b). However, Stone et al. (2011) recently described
a breakthrough bacteremia caused by E. coli that produce NDM
while the patient was treated with tigecycline; the isolate developed
resistance to tigecycline.

SUMMARY
Escherichia coli is an important cause of UTIs, enteric infections,
and systemic infections in humans. The presence to several puta-
tive virulence genes has been positively linked with the pathogenic-
ity of ExPEC including toxins, adhesions, lipopolysaccharides,
polysaccharide capsules, proteases, and invasins that are frequently
encoded by pathogenic islands and other mobile DNA islands.

Up to the late 1990s ExPEC was relatively susceptible to ﬁrst
line antibiotics, however several surveillance studies during the
2000s across the world have shown increasing resistance to ﬁrst
line antibiotics including the cephalosporins, ﬂuoroquinolones,
and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. The “newer β-lactamases”
that consists of plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases (e.g., CMY
types), ESBL (e.g., CTX-M types), and carbapenemases (e.g.,
NDM) are important causes of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics
among ExPEC.

Recent reports suggest that certain sequence types such as
ST38, ST131, ST405, and ST648 might play an important role
in the worldwide distribution and success of CTX-M-producing
E. coli. Future investigations should be undertaken to study the
microbiological and ecological factors that make CTX-M and
NDM-producing E. coli such successful pathogens including well-
designed epidemiological, clinical, and molecular studies to under-
stand the dynamics of transmission, risk factors, and reservoirs for
ST131.
