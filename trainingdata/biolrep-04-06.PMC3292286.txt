Abstract
In contrast to the development of Th1 (type 1 T helper cells), Th17 and Treg (regulatory T cells), little is
known of the mechanisms governing Th2 development, which is important for immunity to helminths
and for us to understand the pathogenesis of allergy. A picture is emerging in which mucosal epithelial
cells instruct dendritic cells to promote Th2 responses in the absence of IL-12 (interleukin 12)
production and provide instruction through thymic stromal lymphopoieitin (TSLP) or granulocyte-
macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). At the same time, allergens, helminths and chemical
adjuvants elicit the response of innate immune cells like basophils, which provide more polarizing
cytokines and IL-4 and reinforce Th2 immunity. This unique communication between cells will only be
fully appreciated if we study Th2 immunity in vivo and in a tissue-specific context, and can only be fully
understood if we compare several models of Th2 immune response induction.

Introduction: Th2 lymphocytes, the lesser
gods of adaptive immunity
Th2 cell immunity is something of a two-edged sword.
These cells evolved to fight off parasites, but they are also
responsible for allergic diseases. Recent advances in
understanding Th2 immunity bring us closer to more
effective treatments for allergic diseases like allergic
asthma and rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and food allergy.
These are clearly on the rise in western societies, and pose a
significant burden on the health of millions of patients
and on health expenditure.

The immune system evolved to neutralize or kill invading
pathogens, while at the same time avoiding reactivity to
self, harmless commensal organisms and environmental
antigens like allergens. Most often, pathogens are
neutralized through the effector mechanisms of innate
immunity, such as the activation of complement, and
phagocytosis and/or killing by macrophages, neutrophils
or eosinophils. These innate responses are reinforced by
adaptive immunity, in that humoral immunity facilitates

complement activation and phagocytosis by innate
immune cells and that particular subsets of T lympho-
cytes help innate effector cells through release of
cytokines. CD4+ T helper lymphocytes are divided into
broad categories based on the cytokines produced. Th1
lymphocytes produce interferon (IFN)-g and stimulate
the phagocytosis and killing of intracellular bacteria by
macrophages. Th17 lymphocytes produce IL-17, which
stimulates neutrophils to kill extracellular bacteria and
fungi. Th2 lymphocytes produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. IL-5
stimulates the differentiation of eosinophils, which have
important roles in killing helminths and other parasites,
whereas IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate contraction of smooth
muscle and overproduction of mucus, which helps in
expulsion of helminths from the gut and lung. The IL-4
(and, to a lesser extent IL-13) produced by Th2 cells also
drives the class switching of B cell immunoglobulin
production towards immunoglobulin E. Antigen-specific
IgE subsequently arms effector cells, like basophils and
mast cells, that express the high affinity IgE receptor
(FceRI, Fc e receptor I), which rapidly degranulate upon

re-encounter with the antigen and help in parasite
expulsion or resistance to reinfection [1]. Not surpris-
ingly, therefore, Th2 immune responses are often accom-
panied by activated eosinophils, basophils, and mast
cells, as well as goblet cell hyperplasia and functional
changes to the surrounding tissues. These activation loops
of innate and adaptive immunity need to be closely
regulated. Naturally occurring and induced Treg dampen
overt inflammatory reactions to microorganisms, and also
suppress immunity to self, by suppressing the activation of
innate immune cells, the antigen presenting capacity of
dendritic cells and the effector function of Th1, Th2 and
Th17 cells.

Despite the wealth of information and explosion of
recent research on how Th1, Th17 and Treg responses are
programmed, relatively less is known about the initia-
tion of Th2 responses. Understanding Th2 immunity is
to understanding allergic
important, as it is central
diseases. Like helminth infection,
these diseases are
characterized by increased production of IgE antibodies
(to inhaled or ingested harmless allergens) and eosino-
philic infiltration of the affected tissues. One possible
contributing factor to the increase in allergies in the west
is that the most commonly used adjuvant for vaccines
in humans aluminum hydroxide is also a known Th2
inducer in mice and humans, so understanding its
mechanism of action might have great implications for
design of better adjuvants [1]. We will not describe the
precise molecular mechanisms of Th2 lineage decisions
during Th polarization and development, as this is the
subject of several recent excellent review articles [2-4]. It
has been shown that dendritic cells are at the very heart
of inducing T cell responses; however, there has been a
lot of debate about how, and even if, they are involved in
Th2 response induction. Here, we will discuss the role of
dendritic cells in different Th2 models and focus on the
communication of dendritic cells with their neighboring
epithelial cells and the cells of the innate immune
response like basophils, mast cells and eosinophils.

The role of dendritic cells in different Th2
models
Dendritic cells perform a unique sentinel function in the
immune response in that
they recognize antigens
through expression of ancient pathogen pattern recogni-
tion receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs),
NOD-like receptors, and C-type lectin receptors. These
receptors will recognize motifs on virtually any patho-
gen, allergen, or substance. In addition, dendritic cells
have been shown to be sensitive to more generic stress
responses, such as oxidative stress, increased rates of
protein synthesis and hypoxia, that could also signal the
presence of xenobiotics,
tissue injury and

local

disturbance of homeostasis [5,6]. Dendritic cells take
up, process and present antigens on their surface, and
posses the ability to migrate from the tissues to the
draining lymph node. Having all
these capabilities,
dendritic cells are at the crossroads between innate and
adaptive immunity [7].

The study of the functional
importance of dendritic
cells in various Th2 diseases has been greatly aided by the
availability of transgenic models in which dendritic cells
can be conditionally depleted or rendered functionally
incapable of antigen presentation [9-12]. In one such
model, in which cd11cDTR mice were subjected to house
dust mite exposure, it was shown that Th2 immunity,
as measured by the early production of IL-4 in CD4+
T lymphocytes and the development of airway eosino-
philia and IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 production by mediastinal
lymph node T cells, failed to develop [8]. Also, it was
shown that Th2 immunity and features of Th2-dependent
asthma did not develop following inhalation of the
harmless protein antigen ovalbumin in the lung when
dendritic cells were eliminated [9,10]. This dependence of
Th2 immunity on dendritic cells was also seen when mice
with chronic airway remodeling (typically seen in asthma
of long duration) were exposed to a new allergen [16].
When dendritic cells were depleted during infection with
the parasitic helminth Schistosoma mansoni, Th2 immunity
failed to develop and responses skewed towards a Th1
dominated response [11]. In a more chronic model of the
intestinal parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Th2 effector
responses in the gut were severely affected by dendritic cell
depletion [12]. Finally, depletion of CD11chi dendritic
cells in mice exposed to ovalbumin antigen in the Th2
adjuvant alum completely abolished Th2 immunity, as
measured by the induction of
IgE responses and
eosinophilic airway inflammation upon ovalbumin aero-
sol re-exposure in immunized mice [13]. It was shown
that a large part of the adjuvant effects of alum were
mediated by the in vivo release of the endogenous danger
signal uric acid. When uric acid crystals are mixed with
harmless ovalbumin and injected intraperitoneally, this
also induced Th2 immunity, and this response was
abolished in cd11cDTR mice depleted of dendritic cells
[14]. These experiments showed that CD11chi dendritic
cells are necessary for Th2 immunity. However, it has to
be noted that by using the cd11c promoter to deplete
dendritic cells, there are also some off target effects. It has
been shown that alveolar macrophages and a propor-
tion CD8+ T cells and plasma cells also express
CD11c and will,
thereby, also be depleted by this
treatment [10,15]. However, adoptive transfer of these
affected cell types showed that the effect seen by depleting
cells expressing CD11c was due to the depletion of
dendritic cells [10].

Having established that dendritic cells are necessary for
induction of Th2 immunity, we asked whether they are
sufficient. When we transferred as few as 30,000 house
dust mite-pulsed lung-derived dendritic cells into the
lungs of naïve mice, a Th2 response to house dust mite
was induced and eosinophilic airway inflammation
developed upon re-exposure of the mice to house dust
mite [8]. More precise studies are warranted to define
with certainty whether specific subsets of dendritic cells
(inflammatory dendritic cells versus subtypes of
CD24+CD8a+CD103+ or CD24-CD11b+ conventional
dendritic cells) are differentially endowed with potential
to induce Th2 immunity. However, this question can be
partially, yet indirectly, answered by the fact that Th2
sensitization can be induced by adoptive transfer of GM-
CSF cultured bone marrow dendritic cells, most closely
resembling mature monocyte-derived CD11b+ dendritic
cells, but not by Flt3L cultured bone marrow-derived
dendritic cells that more resemble the immature, steady-
state dendritic cells resident in the lymph nodes and
spleen [14,16,18,19]. Lung dendritic cells can be divided
into several subsets [17], grossly divided into CD11c+
conventional dendritic cells and CD11clow plasmacytoid
dendritic cells. Conventional dendritic cells can be
further divided based on expression of either the
myeloid marker CD11b or the integrins CD103 (aEb7)
and langerin (CD207) [20]. During inflammation,
monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells are also
attracted to the site of inflammation [13].

Function can also be site-dependent. In the skin and gut,
CD103+ dendritic cells are primarily involved in cross-
presentation of self or foreign antigens to CD8+ T cells,
the generation of gut-tropic effector T cells and the
induction of Treg. In the lung, however, it has recently
been shown that CD11b+ dendritic cells were more
efficient at inducing Th2 cells producing IL-4 and IL-10,
whereas CD103+ dendritic cells induced greater frequen-
cies of CD4+ T cells producing IFN-g and IL-17A [18].
The role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the induction
of Th2 immunity is unclear. Several experiments from
several groups have shown that plasmacytoid dendritic
cells dampen Th2 immunity to inhaled antigens in vivo
[19-21]. However, plasmacytoid dendritic cells have
been shown to activate memory Th2 cells in vitro [22].
Recently, it was shown that increased PD-L1 and PD-L2
expression in plasmacytoid dendritic cells activated Th2
effector cells [23]. The precise role of plasmacytoid
dendritic cells in suppressing Th2 development in the
lung is the subject of intense research. The function of
plasmacytoid dendritic cells is in balance with that of
conventional dendritic cells and determined by the
cytokine osteopontin [24], as well as by activation of
the complement system [25,28].

Dendritic cell-independent development of
Th2 immunity
Recent papers have proposed that basophils, rather than
dendritic cells, are the true inducers of Th2 lymphocyte
responses by serving as an early source for the Th2
instructive cytokine IL-4 and, at the same time, acting as
antigen presenting cells [26,27]. These authors also
suggested that for some antigens, like the model allergen
papain or for the helminth Trichuris muris, dendritic cells
were neither sufficient nor necessary for Th2 induction.
These conclusions were based on the use of mice expressing
MHCII exclusively from the cd11c promoter, and recon-
stituted with CD4+ wild type T cells. These mice poorly
reconstitute MHCII expression on migratory inflammatory
dendritic cells, which might explain the lack of evidence in
this model for a role of dendritic cells as sufficient APCs for
inducing Th2 immunity. Another caveat to these studies
was the use of the MAR1 antibody to the FceRI. We, and
others, have found that inflammatory dendritic cells are
also depleted by this antibody [8,28]. Studies employing
genetic strategies to deplete basophils using Cre/lox
technology (mcpt8Cre mice) have found that Th2 immu-
nity to papain and the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis
is unaffected in the absence of basophils, yet severely
depleted when dendritic cells are genetically targeted using
cd11cDTA mice [29]. Another recent study showed that in
vivo basophils did not interact with antigen-specific T cells
in the lymph node and that IL-4 producing basophils could
only be found in the affected peripheral tissues [30]. We
concur with the view of others that the most likely scenario
is that basophils cooperate with dendritic cells to promote
Th2 immunity, but do not necessarily have to present
antigen to perform this function (Figure 1) [8,31].

Direct dendritic cell – T cell interaction and
Th2 instruction
In the draining lymph node, dendritic cells interact with
naïve Th cells and induce their differentiation. Whereas
activated CD4+ T cells differentiate into the Th1 lineage in
response to IL-12 provided by the dendritic cells, similar
signals that initiate Th2 differentiation remain poorly
characterized. Th2 differentiation is induced through the
actions of the cytokine IL-4 in the absence of IL-12
production by dendritic cells. When we retrovirally
overexpressed IL-12, GM-CSF cultured dendritic cells
were no longer capable of inducing Th2 immunity in the
lungs [32]. Others have proposed that production of IL-6
could be decisive in Th2 instruction [33-35], since IL-4KO
mice can still mount a Th2 response [36,37].

Differentiation of naïve Th cells into Th2 cells requires the
upregulation of the transcription factor GATA3 [38] and
requires activation of STAT-5 (through IL-2 or TSLP) and
STAT-6 transcription factors [39]. GATA3 and STAT-6

activation can be upregulated either through IL-4R signal-
ling or Jagged-Notch signalling [40,41]. Notch-dependent
signals have been shown to directly regulate GATA-3
expression and critically control Th cell fate in vivo
[40,42,43]. However,
it has also been suggested that
Notch signals provide survival and proliferative advantages
to committed Th cells rather than direct commitment to
the Th cell fate [44]. Nonetheless, recently Jagged1, and not
Jagged2, expression on dendritic cells has been shown to be

critical for IL-4 induction and the promotion of allergic
responses. Where exactly the STAT-5 activating signal
comes from is less well understood. Dendritic cells have
been shown to produce IL-2 and TSLP, but these could also
be produced by T cells in an autocrine manner upon T cell
activation [45].

Besides the expression of Jagged and production of
cytokines, other surface markers on dendritic cells can

Antigen stimulation leads to TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin) or IL(interleukin)-25 production from stromal cells, which subsequently stimulates
type 2 effector cytokine expression from various cell types, including innate lymphoid cells, basophils and mast cells. Alternatively, IL-33, which induces
many of the features similar to IL-25 and TSLP, is released as an active form from necrotic cells and acts as an alarmin. Besides IL-33, uric acid is
released from dying cells and produced by macrophages after alum or house dust mite stimulation. In addition, certain antigens such as Omega-1 from
the helminth S. mansoni prime dendritic cells, so that they guide CD4+ T cells towards a Th(T helper cells)2 response. Abbreviations: DC, dendritic cell;

influence Th2 differentiation. The expression of OX40L
on dendritic cells has also been shown to be required for
optimal Th2 priming [46-48]. The expression of OX40L
on dendritic cells is dependent upon signalling through
CD40 [47,49,50]. Furthermore, CD40 expression itself is
important for Th2 induction as CD40-/- dendritic cells
were incapable of inducing Th2 responses to helminth
antigens [50]. CD40 interacts with CD154 on T cells
and this also seems to be necessary for Th2 immunity.
When mice deficient
in CD154 were infected with
S. mansoni helminths, they did not induce Th2 immunity
and suffered from severe morbidity and mortality [51].
More confirmation is provided by the observation
that S. mansoni egg preparations prime Th2 cells via the
functional modulation of dendritic cells [46,52]. Den-
dritic cells exposed to parasitic helminth-derived anti-
gens,
including SEA, are distinguished by their low
production of IL-12, which is thought to be a prerequi-
site for their Th2-inducing capacity [53]. The omega-1
antigen from Schistosoma applied to dendritic cells in vitro
independent of IL-4Ra
stimulates Th2 development
signalling in vivo [54].

Interaction of dendritic cells with epithelial
cells leads to polarization of dendritic cells
Stromal cells have been shown to be important in
instructing dendritic cell behavior, particularly in muco-
sal tissues where epithelial cells represent the first line
barrier to the outside world, making them candidates for
orchestrating immune responses [55-58]. Some support-
ing evidence for this comes from the finding that certain
dendritic cells are located just below the epithelial lining
in the lung, making them easily assessable for epithelial
cell-derived factors (Figure 2) [17]. Indeed, chemokines
like CCL2 and CCL20 that attract immature dendritic
cells and their precursors are produced by airway
epithelial cells exposed to Th2 stimuli like house dust
mite [59-62]. In response to inhaled allergens, airway
epithelial cells secrete a variety of cytokines (GM-CSF,
TSLP, IL-25, IL-33, and IL-1 family members), which
contribute to dendritic cell maturation and drive them
into a Th2-activating mode [59,63].

One example of this was shown in mice overexpressing
GM-CSF, who showed a break of tolerance to the inhaled
harmless antigen ovalbumin, and developed a strong Th2
allergic airway inflammation driven by mature dendritic
cells [64]. Also, in a mouse model of house dust mite-
induced asthma, GM-CSF was shown to be necessary (but
not sufficient) for proper Th2 responses [65-68].

Another well-described Th2-inducing cytokine pro-
duced by epithelial cells (but also by mast cells and
dendritic cells
inflammatory

themselves under

conditions) is TSLP [45,59,69]. Initially, TSLP was
found to potently enhance the maturation of CD11c+
dendritic cells, and TSLP-primed dendritic cells were
shown to promote Th2 differentiation. TSLP was
reported to exert its Th2-promoting properties through
a dendritic cell-mediated pathway that involved induc-
tion of OX40L [59,70-72]. Mice overexpressing TSLP in
the lung epithelium had increased asthma features [73],
whereas blockade of the TSLP-R inhibited key features of
allergic asthma [74]. Besides the effects on dendritic
cells, TSLP also influences the function of mast cells and
basophils, cell types involved in Th2 responses, by
acting as a growth factor [75,76]. In specific helminth
infections,
like H. polygyrus, N. brasiliensis and S.
mansoni, TSLP plays a role in the clearance of worms
induced by Th2 immunity [77]. While, TSLP is not
necessary for clearing all helminth infections,
for
Trichuris muris it was shown to be indispensible; this
could be because T. muris is less efficient
in Th2
induction and more potent than other helminths in
triggering Th1 responses [3].

IL-25 (also known as IL-17E) was initially reported as a
Th2 cell-derived cytokine, but it can also be produced by
basophils [72] and airway epithelial cells in response to
allergens and respiratory viruses [78,79]. In mice, over-
expression of IL-25 in lung epithelial cells led to allergic
inflammation, likely due to the capacity of IL-25 to
activate dendritic cells to induce Th2 responses [80].
Injection of neutralizing anti-IL-25 antibodies was able to
strongly reduce allergic airway inflammation and airway
remodelling [78].

The last group of Th2 instructive cytokines discussed here
are the IL-1 family members. Some IL-1 family members
are produced as pro-cytokines that require cleavage by
caspase-1 through the inflammasome activation to be
released [81]. IL-1a and IL-1b both bind to the IL-1
receptor 1 (IL-1RI), which is present on almost all cell
types, including structural cells such as airway epithelial
cells [82,83]. IL-1b is released from cultured airway
epithelial cells following protease allergen exposure and
enhances the release of
the dendritic cell-attracting
chemokine CCL20, and of the dendritic cell maturation
cytokines TSLP and GM-CSF [84,85]. IL-1R signalling
involves the adaptor molecule MyD88, also found
downstream of several TLRs. Interestingly, house dust
mite-induced Th2 responses in the lung were found to be
strongly reduced in MyD88-/- mice [86]; however,
pathology induced by S. mansoni infection was unaltered
[87]. Also, dendritic cells have been shown to express
ST2, the receptor for the IL-1 family member IL-33. This
cytokine is expressed in airway epithelial cells where it is
constitutively stored in nuclei. Its location is unexpected,

Figure 2. Interactions between airway epithelial cells and dendritic cells

Dendritic cells (DCs) sample the airway lumen by forming dendritic extensions between epithelial cells. Enzymatically active allergens, like house dust mite can
stimulate airway epithelial cells, via TLR(toll-like receptor)4 followed by NF-kB (nuclear factor-kB) activation, to produce chemokines and cytokines that
attract and activate DCs. Certain cytokines, like IL(interleukin)-25 and IL-33 will lead to the upregulation of OX40L, CD40 and ST2, which will lead to
polarization of CD4+ T cells towards a Th2 phenotype. Other cytokines like IL-1a and b activate DCs, but also have a positive autocrine feedback on epithelial
cells and further stimulate the production of TSLP and GM-CSF. Abbreviations: DC, dendritic cell; EC, epithelial cell; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage
colony stimulating factor; HDM, house dust mite; IL, interleukin; NF-kB, nuclear factor-kB; TLR, toll-like receptor; TSLP, thymic stromal lymphopoietin.

and how it is released into the extracellular environment
remains unclear. It has been postulated, however, that
IL-33 might act as an alarmin in case of allergen exposure
[88]. Dendritic cells exposed to IL-33 increased their
expression of maturation markers, such as CD40 and
OX40L and, thereby, became very potent at inducing Th2
responses [89,90]. Both IL-33 and IL-25 have also been
shown to induce an allergic phenotype or helminth
clearance independent of Th2 lymphocytes [91,92]. In
Rag deficient mice, which lack T and B cells, innate
lymphoid cells producing IL-5 and IL-13 are induced by
IL-25 or IL-33 [93].

PRR expression by radioresistant stromal cells determines
Th2 immune response induction by dendritic cells
Several groups have used radiation chimeric models to
study the relative importance of PRRs of the TLR or NLR
(NOD-like receptors) family to induction of Th2 immu-
nity. Using chimeric Tlr4-/- animals, we and others have
demonstrated that the expression of TLR4 on epithelial
cells is crucial in inducing dendritic cell recruitment and
intramucosal migratory behaviour in response to LPS and
house dust mite [59,94]. In response to house dust mite
inhalation, TSLP, GM-CSF, IL-25 and IL-33 are made in an
epithelial TLR4-dependent manner [59]. TLR4 is triggered

F1000 Biology Reports 2012, 4:6

http://f1000.com/reports/b/4/6

by endotoxin found inside the house dust mite extract and
this is facilitated by the house dust mite allergen Der p 2,
which behaves like the MD2 chaperone and is important
for TLR4 activation [95]. This seems to be a common
theme, as many natural and synthetic allergens like cat
allergen Fel d 1 and nickel also trigger TLR4. Although
some helminths like S. mansoni activate dendritic cells via
TLR2 and TLR3, these receptors are dispensable to control
infection and pathology [96].

In a recent study, it was shown that Th2 immunity,
induced by injection of ovalbumin with agonists of the
NLR receptors NOD1 and NOD2, was also dependent on
stromal expression of these receptors, acting to induce the
systemic production of TSLP and induction of dendritic
cell maturation [97]. The precise role of other NLRs like
NLRP3 (involved in the formation of the IL-1 and IL-18
inducing inflammasome) in Th2 immunity to natural
allergens and alum is very controversial. Initially, it was
proposed that Th2 immunity to alum was completely
abolished in the absence of Nlrp3 [98], but others have
refuted this idea [14,99,100], and it has long been known
that alum-induced Th2 asthma models were IL-1R and
MyD88-independent [101]. Papers show either an abro-
gation of alum response in the absence of NLRP3
[98,102], no need for NLRP3 [103,104], or a selective
need for NLRP3 [105]. The differences found by the
different groups could be due to the type of alum and
ovalbumin used and/or mouse strain background.

For natural Th2 immunity to house dust mite in the lung,
we and others have found the NLRP3 inflammasome to be
irrelevant [14], whereas others have found a lack of the
NLRP3 inflammasome to cause a deficiency in Th2
induction when house dust mite was applied to the skin
[106]. These studies have certainly aroused interest in
inflammasomes, and it remains to be determined how
other NLRs are involved in Th2 immune responses to
allergens and helminths. Finally, stromal cells (like
epithelial cells, and also dendritic cells) express C-type
lectin receptors like dectin-2 that have been shown to
be involved in Th2 immune responses to house dust mite
allergen [107]. Signalling through these receptors often
involves the spleen tyrosine kinase pathway that increas-
ingly appears to be crucial for Th2 development [14,34],
through, as yet, unidentified mechanisms.

Conclusion
Recent advances are starting to dissect the mechanisms of
Th2 development, and a picture is emerging that
mucosal epithelial cells instruct dendritic cells to
promote Th2 responses by inducing their activation in
the absence of IL-12 production. At the same time Th2
stimulates innate immune cells like basophils, mast cells

and innate lymphoid cell 2 to produce more polarizing
cytokines and ILl-4, which reinforce Th2 immunity. This
unique communication network of cells will only be
fully appreciated if we study Th2 immunity in vivo in a
tissue specific context, and if we compare several models
of Th2 immune response induction,
like helminth
infection, allergen exposure and chemical adjuvants.
Given the role of dendritic cells in promoting allergy,
greater understanding may yield new targets for preven-
tion and treatment.
