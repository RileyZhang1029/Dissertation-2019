In allergic diseases such as asthma, eosinophils, basophils
and mast cells, through release of preformed and newly
generated mediators, granule proteins and cytokines, are
recognized as key effector cells. While their surface protein
phenotypes, mediator release proﬁles, ontogeny, cell trafﬁck-
ing and genomes have been generally explored and com-
pared, there has yet to be any thorough analysis and
comparison of their glycomes. Such studies are critical to
understand the contribution of carbohydrates to the induc-
tion and regulation of allergic inﬂammatory responses and
are now possible using improved technologies for detecting
and characterizing cell-derived glycans. We thus report
here the application of high-sensitivity mass spectrometric-
based glycomics methodologies to the analysis of N-linked
glycans derived from isolated populations of human mast
cells, eosinophils and basophils. The samples were subjected
to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)
time-of-ﬂight (TOF) screening analyses and MALDI-TOF/
TOF sequencing studies. Results reveal substantive quan-
tities of terminal N-acetylglucosamine containing structures
in both the eosinophil and the basophil samples, whereas
mast cells display greater relative quantities of sialylated
terminal epitopes. For the ﬁrst time, we characterize the cell
surface glycan structures of principal allergic effector cells,
which by interaction with glycan-binding proteins (e.g.
lectins) have the possibility to dictate cellular functions, and
might thus have important implications for the pathogenesis
of inﬂammatory and allergic diseases.

Introduction

Eosinophils, basophils and mast cells comprise the triumvirate
of principal allergic effector cells. Each cell type has its own
bone marrow differentiation paradigm, as well as distinct, yet
often overlapping pathways regulating their development,
migration, activation,
survival and death (Bochner and
Schleimer 2001). Much of what is known about the biologic
contributions of these cell types to allergic and other forms of
inﬂammation stems from extensive efforts to characterize their
release of preformed and newly generated mediators, granule
proteins and cytokines. It has also been revealing to compare
and contrast the capabilities and characteristics of these cells
at the protein and gene levels (Valent 1994; Agis et al. 1996;
Miyazaki et al. 1997; Nakajima et al. 2001).

The mammalian glycome, namely the entire complement of
carbohydrates in or on a cell, is encoded by a series of post-
translational modiﬁcations made to proteins and lipids.
Hundreds of enzymes control these steps, which are primarily
carried out within the Golgi of each cell. These glycans
appear to have multiple and overlapping functions. They are
recognized by glycan-binding proteins with lectin activity on
apposing cells, and such glycan-ligand interactions mediate
many biologic activities including recognition of pathogens
and induction of intracellular signaling pathways. Although
information on the biological roles of glycan-binding proteins
continues to evolve, challenges remain in detecting and quan-
tifying existing and novel cellular glycans.

Advances over the last decade in mass spectrometric tech-
niques, most notably the development and increased utilization
of the MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer, have driven a
period of steady progress in the analysis of glycan populations
derived from biological samples previously considered too
complex or low in abundance to provide meaningful data. The
comparative improvements provisioned by such techniques are
exempliﬁed by a recent glycomic reassessment of human neu-
trophil isolates (Babu et al. 2009). Dramatic improvements in
upper mass range and signal-to-noise ratios, in addition to sub-
stantive increases in sensitivity and resolution allowed the
characterization of an expanded population of both protein
N- and O-linked glycans. Coupled with the ability to fragment
glycan molecular ions and produce informative structural data
at masses up to 6000 Da, these and similar related techniques

(such as electron transfer dissociation and electron capture dis-
sociation; Perdivara et al. 2009) are now allowing the glycomic
characterization of immune cell populations, even those with
relatively limited abundance.

Indeed, the primary focus of one of the major international
glycobiology consortia,
the Consortium for Functional
Glycomics (CFG), is the analysis of mammalian immune cell
populations. To date, structural proﬁling work has been com-
pleted on a number of important components, including neu-
trophils (Babu et al. 2009), dendritic cells (Bax et al. 2007),
monocytes, natural killer cells and T- and B-lymphocytes as
well as erythrocytes. Data from all work are freely available
in the CFG databases (http://www.functionalglycomics.org/

structural analysis of
N-glycans derived from samples of human basophils, eosino-
phils and mast cells. The eosinophil and basophil samples
share a high level of heavily truncated structures with limited
levels of sialylated termini, while the mast cells conversely
exhibit a relatively high abundance of terminal sialic acid.

Results
Glycomics screening strategy
In order to produce isolated pools of N-linked glycans derived
from each of the investigated cell types (human basophils, eosi-
nophils and mast cells), each sample was sonicated, reduced,
carboxymethylated and proteolytically digested with trypsin to
produce short peptides and glycopeptides amenable to enzy-
matic deglycosylation. N-Linked glycan release was then
achieved by means of treatment of these tryptic fragments with
peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). Once puriﬁed, the pool
of N-glycans was derivatized by means of chemical permethy-
lation in order to enhance the sensitivity of mass spectrometric
detection and to assist predictable fragmentation when sub-
jected to tandem mass
spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis.
MALDI-TOF-MS proﬁling was utilized in order to produce a
ﬁngerprint of the derivatized N-glycans derived from each
original cell sample. These proﬁles consist of singly charged
sodiated molecular ions ([M + Na]+) that are putatively ident-
iﬁed by means of a combination of compositional analysis and
knowledge of available biosynthetic pathways. These tentative
assignments are then reinforced by supplementary experiments
utilizing tandem MS/MS analyses and gas chromatography
(GC)-MS linkage studies, which are variously capable of con-
ﬁrming the presence of structural features such as antennal
arrangements, terminal moieties and core modiﬁcations such as
fucosylation or the presence of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine
(GlcNAc) residues. The assignment of both glycan MS and
MS/MS spectra are assisted by the application of the glycoin-
formatic tools Cartoonist and GlycoWorkbench (Goldberg
et al. 2005; Ceroni et al. 2008).

Though mass spectrometric analyses of this type are not
fully quantitative, recent studies have established that rela-
tive quantitation based on the signal strength of permethy-
lated glycans analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS is indeed both
possible and accurate, especially when comparisons are
carried out among related species across small mass ranges
(Wada et al. 2007).

Glycomic analysis of human mast cells, eosinophils and basophils

Basophils
Samples of basophils were subjected to the glycomics screening
strategy, as outlined in the glycomics screening strategy section.
The PNGase F released N-linked glycans were derivatized via
permethylation and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis.
The results of a typical analysis are displayed in Figure 1A.
Complete compositional assignments can be found in Table I.

The N-glycan spectrum of human basophils contains a full
complement of high-mannose (Man)
type structures (m/z
1579.8, 1783.9, 1988.0, 2192.1 and 2396.2), as well as a
series of complex type glycans comprising a mixture of bi-,
tri- and tetra-antennary structures. These are mostly core-
fucosylated, with a relatively low level of N-acetylneuraminic
acid (NeuAc) terminal residues (n = 1–2); and some evidence
for low-abundance antennal fucosylation and simple hybrid
glycans.

The spectrum is characterized by the presence of a high
abundance of unsubstituted terminal GlcNAc residues. These
part-processed structures are present throughout the spectrum
in signiﬁcant quantities and are interspersed with structures
bearing a bisecting GlcNAc residue, an observation veriﬁed
by signiﬁcant levels of 3,4,6-linked Man identiﬁed in GC-MS
linkage analyses (data not shown). The most prominent peak
in the basophil sample at m/z 1835.9 corresponds to a glycan
composition of Fuc1Hex3HexNAc4, consistent with a core-
fucosylated part-processed structure bearing a pair of exposed
GlcNAc residues. MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS fragmentation
analysis of this molecular ion (Figure 2) conﬁrms this as the
most likely arrangement of the individual residues. The level
at which this and other truncated structures are present in the
sample can be assessed by evaluation of the levels at which
similar glycans are observed in the mass spectrum, in this
case the truncated core-fucosylated structure with and without
galactose
antennae.
Comparison of the relative intensities of three related species
at m/z 1835.9, 2040.0 and 2244.1 (corresponding to compo-
sitions
and
Fuc1Hex5HexNAc4, respectively) shows a ratio of relative
intensities of 8:4:1,
the non-substituted
structure is approximately twice as abundant as its singly
galactosylated form.

Eosinophils
Approximately 10 × 107 human eosinophils isolated from
allergic donors were subjected to the glycomics methodology
described in the glycomics screening strategy section. The
mass spectrum acquired from a typical sample of released,
permethylated N-glycans is shown in Figure 1B, with the
complete annotation of the spectrum presented in Table I.

The eosinophil samples produce a very similar glycomics
proﬁle to that of the basophils. The full complement of
high-Man N-glycans are present (m/z 1579.8, 1783.9, 1988.0,
2192.1 and 2396.2) and a number of complex glycans can be
identiﬁed, with antennal arrangements consistent with bi-, tri-
and tetra-antennary forms. Sialylation is a relatively low-
abundance terminal modiﬁcation, though slightly more promi-
nent than in the comparable basophil sample (n = 1–3). Some
low-level antennal fucosylation is also observed, together with
limited amounts of simple hybrid structures.

annotated with their proposed carbohydrate structure, according to the symbolic nomenclature adopted by the CFG (Varki et al. 2009). For complete annotations
of the spectra, see Table I. All molecular ions are present in singly charged sodiated form ([M + Na]+).

The distinctive feature of the eosinophil spectra, in similar
fashion to the basophils, is a remarkable level of truncated
or unsubstituted part-processed glycans. The base peak of
the spectrum at m/z 1835.9 corresponds to the same core-
fucosylated part-processed structure bearing a pair of exposed
GlcNAc residues that was observed in the basophils and was
similarly conﬁrmed via MS/MS analyses (data not shown).

Bisecting GlcNAc is again a common structural
feature
among the N-glycans derived from the eosinophil samples,
though at a slightly lower relative level when compared with
that of the basophils.

Mast cells
Samples of human mast cells containing (cid:1)15 × 106 cells were
taken through the glycomics screening procedure as described.
Isolated N-glycans were chemically modiﬁed into their per-
methyl derivatives and analyzed by MALDI-TOF and

MS, with the annotated results displayed in Figure 3
(N-glycans) and Figure 4 (O-glycans). Full assignments of all
of the observed molecular ions can be found in Table I.

The high-Man family of glycan structures is present (at m/z
1579.8, 1783.9, 1988.0, 2192.1 and 2396.2) together with a
low level of simple hybrid structures. The majority of the
high-abundance signals among N-glycans derived from mast
cells are of the complex type, comprising bi-, tri- and tetra-
antennary structures,
the vast majority of which are core-
fucosylated. Bisecting GlcNAc is also a common structural
feature, with some limited antennal fucosylation also present.
There is a signiﬁcant level of terminal NeuAc sialylation present
within the N-glycan proﬁle of the mast cells, with the majority
of abundant peaks bearing between one and four sialic acid resi-
dues. This is especially evident in the higher mass region of the
spectrum, with the larger structures being observed almost exclu-
sively with high levels of sialylation. Much larger structures than
those observed in either the basophil or the eosinophil samples
are also evident, with up to three poly-N-acetyllactosamine
extensions (Galβ1-4GlcNAc β1-3-) observed.

Signiﬁcantly,

the mast cell sample displays only small
amounts of the truncation/part processing that
is abundant
among the N-glycans of both the basophils and the eosinophils.
Making the same comparison between the related peaks at m/z
1835.9, 2040.0 and 2244.1 in the mast cell sample (correspond-
ing to compositions of Fuc1Hex3HexNAc4, Fuc1Hex4HexNAc4
and Fuc1Hex5HexNAc4, respectively) yields a ratio of relative
intensities of approximately 1:1:2, showing that the abundance
of a typical unsubstituted putative antenna is approximately the
same as that of a galactosylated one.

LAD2 cells
N- and O-linked glycans were isolated from cultured human
leukocyte adhesion deﬁciency 2 (LAD2) cells utilizing the gly-
comics methodology detailed in the glycomics screening strat-
egy section. The permethylated derivatives of these glycans
were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF/TOF

16

In a similar fashion to the N-linked glycan pools derived from
the other cell types in this study, the LAD2 cell line produces a
full range of high-Man glycans (observed at m/z 1580.2, 1784.3,
1988.4, 2192.5 and 2396.5) together with some low abundance
hybrid-type structures. Prevalent among the mid to high-mass
regions are a series of complex glycans, bearing two, three and
four antennae, most of which are fucosylated at the core and it is
of note that there is a particularly signiﬁcant amount of tetra-
antennary glycans. Some evidence for bisecting GlcNAc is
observed, but together with antennal fucosylation, this structural
modiﬁcation appears to be minimal. Sialylation is abundant,
with the majority of the complex N-glycans bearing between
one and three NeuAc terminal epitopes on their antennae.
LacNAc (Galβ1-4GlcNAc) extension of antenna is also
common, with the largest glycans possessing at
three
poly-N-acetyllactosamine extensions.

Signiﬁcantly less truncated structures are observed among
the N-glycan population of the LAD2 cell line when compared
with similar samples from the other immune cells studied here.
The truncated core-fucosylated structure and the singly
galactosylated glycan (corresponding to compositions of
Fuc1Hex3HexNAc4 and Fuc1Hex4HexNAc4) prominent in the
other samples are both present in vanishingly small quantities
when compared with the di-galactosylated form at m/z 2245.5,
which is present in a quantity of (cid:1)10 times that of the others.
The advantages of studying a cell line such as a stem cell
factor (SCF) dependent human mast cell line like LAD2, as
opposed to cell isolates, are readily apparent in the number of
additional experiments that can be effectively performed
within the glyco-analysis framework. High-quality data from
chemically released O-glycans were additionally obtained and
a typical proﬁle from a subsequent MALDI-TOF analysis of
the permethyl derivatives is shown in Figure 4. The vast
majority of the O-glycans produced by the LAD2 cells are
of core-1 type, with high levels of sialylation by NeuAc.

Abundant peaks observed at m/z 896.1 and 1257.4 (corre-
sponding to NeuAc1Hex1HexNAc1-itol and NeuAc2Hex1
HexNAc1-itol, respectively) dominate the spectrum,
though
low levels of similarly sialylated core 2 structures are also
observed. Of note is the structure at m/z 1618.6 whose compo-
sition is consistent with a tri-sialylated core 1 O-glycan. This
was conﬁrmed by subsequent MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS frag-
mentation analysis of this molecular ion (Figure 5). Key frag-
ment ions at m/z 981/659 and 620/1020 indicate two possible
structural isomers in which the NeuAcα2-8NeuAc di-sialylated
motif can be linked to either the Gal or N-acetylgalactosamine
of the core 1 O-glycan.

Discussion
This paper describes the ﬁrst detailed glycomic analysis of
human eosinophils, basophils and mast cells that play impor-
tant roles in maintaining homeostasis and in the induction and
perpetuation of allergic and other forms of inﬂammation. In
addition, human LAD2 cultured mast cells were glycomically
characterized. All the analyzed cells displayed both high-Man

18

and complex-type N-glycans. One of the most striking features
of the data is that both eosinophils and basophils contain a
large proportion of part-processed N-glycans which therefore
display large quantities of terminal β-linked GlcNAc residues.
This is clearly illustrated by the fact that in both species the
most abundant N-glycan is a bi-antennary structure with two
terminal non-extended GlcNAc residues (Figures 1 and 2).
This dramatically contrasts to culture-derived human mast cells
(and LAD2 mast cells) which display more highly processed
N-glycans with sialylated and fucosylated multi-antennary
structures and other immune cells, such as human neutrophils,
which have been similarly glycomically characterized. These
possess the most complex N-glycome to date with bi-, tri- and
tetra-antennary structures, capped with one, two, three or four
sialic acid residues with a high degree of fucosylation as well
as prevalent poly-LacNAc extensions (Babu et al. 2009).

As the glycans characterized in this study will be located
on the cells primary interface with their external environment,
the cell surface, they must be involved in interactions which
dictate cellular functions. Such interactions will involve the
recognition of a speciﬁc glycan structure by a speciﬁc lectin.
Previous characterization of
these cells by lectin-binding
studies has been limited. Lectin histochemistry of human mast
cell populations demonstrated binding with concanavalin A
(ConA), pisum sativum agglutinin (PSA),
lens culimaris
agglutinin (LCA), phaseolus vulgaris lectin E (e-PHA), pha-
seolus vulgaris lectin L (l-PHA) and wheat germ agglutinin
(WGA), the speciﬁcities of which are all consistent with the
proposed glycan structures we present (Roberts et al. 1990).
As stated above, both human eosinophils and basophils will
present a large amount of terminal β-linked GlcNAc residues
for speciﬁc lectin interactions. The C-type lectin LSECtin,
which is predominantly expressed on the liver and lymph
node sinusoidal endothelial cells, has been demonstrated to
bind with high selectivity to N-glycans displaying terminal
GlcNAcβ1-2Man structures. Indeed, the calculated inhibition
constant of 3.5 µM for the GlcNAcβ1-2Man disaccharide
indicates one of the highest relative afﬁnities of any C-type
lectin (Powlesland et al. 2008). N-Glycans expressing the
GlcNAcβ1-2Man disaccharide structures such as m/z 1835.9
are highly abundant
in both basophils and eosinophils
(Figures 1 and 2). Within the liver LSECtin has been demon-
strated to have an immunomodulatory function inhibiting T-cell
responses. Also when recombinant LSECtin was administered
intravenously, it signiﬁcantly reduces acute liver inﬂammatory
injury (Tang et al. 2009). Such immunomodulatory and anti-
inﬂammatory function could extend beyond the liver, as
LSECtin has also been demonstrated to be expressed by
human peripheral blood and thymic dendritic cells and
monocyte-derived macrophages (Dominguez-Soto et al. 2007).
Indeed, LSECtin expressed on immune-related cells has been
demonstrated to mediate intracellular interactions with partner
cells via recognition of the same terminal β-linked GlcNAc
rich N-glycans as we have demonstrated to be present on both
human eosinophils and basophils (Yabe et al. 2010).

A second potential binding partner for the GlcNAc rich
eosinophils and basophils cell surface is the protein YKL-40.
This is a chitinase-like protein which lacks hydrolytic enzy-
matic activity but retains the ability to bind to β-GlcNAc

(Lee and Elias 2010). Increased levels of YKL-40 have been
linked with a wide range of human diseases, particularly
those associate with inﬂammation, allergy and tissue remodel-
ing, as illustrated by the fact that asthmatic patents show a sig-
niﬁcantly higher level of YKL-40 than non-asthmatic controls
and that asthma severity also correlates with YKL-40 levels
(Ober and Chupp 2009). In addition, YKL-40 levels have also
been linked to cigarette smoke induced inﬂammation and
emphysema (Matsuura et al. 2011). Studies from BRP-39 (the
mouse homolog of YKL-40)−/− KO mice demonstrated a
reduced antigen-induced Th2 inﬂammatory reaction and
reduced death receptor-mediated eosinophil cell apoptosis
(Lee et al. 2009). As yet, no cell surface ligand for YKL-40
has been identiﬁed. It is enticing to hypothesize that YKL-40
is not binding to a cell surface protein but to the GlcNAc rich
N-glycans which we have characterized in this study.

Although both eosinophils and basophils contain a large
proportion of part-processed N-glycans, they do also express
more highly processed sialylated glycans. Such extensively
processed sialylated glycans are much more highly expressed
on both human mast cells and the LAD2 human mast cells.
Sialylated glycans can be recognized by siglecs (sialic acid-
binding immunoglobulin-like lectins) that are predominantly
expressed by immune cells where, via their cytoplasmic
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and
ITIM-like domains, they regulate cell signaling. Siglecs can
recognize sialylated glycans both in the context of cis (same
cell) and trans (adjacent cell) interactions (Crocker et al.
2007). Of the 14 currently identiﬁed siglecs, mast cells and
basophils have been demonstrated to express siglec-3, -5, -6,
-8 and -14, whereas eosinophils express siglec-8 and -10
(O’Reilly and Paulson 2009).
is noteworthy that both
siglec-5 and -14 have a preferred speciﬁcity for
the
NeuAcα2-8NeuAc di-sialylated motif that we identiﬁed on
the human mast cell line LAD2 O-glycans (Figures 4 and 5).
This remains a relatively rare glycan sequence being limited
to a small number of blood-associated glycoproteins such as
immunoglobulins, MUC-1, α2-macroglobulin, vitronectin,
glycophorin, plasminogen and von Willebrand factor (Fukuda
et al. 1987; Yasukawa et al. 2006; Canis et al. 2010). The
structure has also been described on the O-glycans of human
natural killer cells where it is thought to interact with siglec-7
regulating cellular activation (Avril et al. 2006).

It

In summary, we report here that the application of high-
sensitivity mass spectrometric-based glycomics (MALDI-TOF/
TOF sequencing) to compare and contrast human eosinophil,
basophil and mast cell glycomes. Results reveal substantive
quantities of terminal GlcNAc-containing structures in both
the eosinophil and basophil samples, while mast cells display
greater
relative quantities of sialylated terminal epitopes.
These novel ﬁndings may have important implications for the
involvement and interaction of eosinophils, basophils and
mast cells during inﬂammation and allergic diseases.

Materials and methods
Cell puriﬁcation and culture methods
Basophils. Residual
cell byproducts of normal donors
undergoing plateletpheresis were enriched in basophils using

Glycomic analysis of human mast cells, eosinophils and basophils

a combination of Percoll density gradients and countercurrent-
ﬂow elutriation and negative selection using columns from
Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, CA) and Stem Cell basophil
isolation reagents (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC),
as described (MacGlashan et al. 1994). Basophils counts and
purities were determined by staining with Alcian blue
(Pruzansky et al. 1983) and generally exceeded 99% purity.

Eosinophils. Eosinophils were isolated from allergic donors
on a Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board approved
clinical protocol (NA 00036470) following written informed
consent using density gradient centrifugation, hypotonic lysis
of erythrocytes and immunomagnetic depletion of neutrophils
with CD16 mAb and magnetic beads as described previously
(Matsumoto et al. 1997).

Mast cells. CD34+ cells were obtained from unidentiﬁed
blood donors or normal or allergic volunteers on an NIAID
Institutional Review Board approved clinical protocol (NIH
following written informed consent and with
98-I-0027)
or without granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor before
leukapheresis, followed by a positive selection as described
(Kirshenbaum et al. 1999; Kulka and Metcalfe 2005; Yokoi
et al. 2006).

Human mast cells were derived by culture of these CD34+
peripheral blood precursors, as described (Kirshenbaum et al.
1999; Yokoi et al. 2006). Brieﬂy, cells were cultured at a start-
ing concentration of 5 × 105 cells/mL in serum-free medium
(StemPro-34 SFM; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) sup-
plemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin,
50 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 ng/mL recombinant human SCF
(Biosource, Camarillo, CA), 100 ng/mL recombinant human
IL-6 (Biosource) and 30 ng/mL recombinant human IL-3
the latter for the ﬁrst
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN),
week only. Hemi-depletions of media were performed weekly,
replacing this with fresh media containing 100 ng/mL SCF
and 100 ng/mL IL-6. Cells were cultured at 37°C with 5%
CO2. Cell counts and viability were checked each week by
Trypan blue staining. Mast cells were used after 10.5 weeks
of culture. LAD2 cells were maintained in serum-free media
with SCF (100 ng/mL; Kirshenbaum et al. 2003).

Aliquots of mast cells were activated for 6 h at 37°C by
aggregation of FcRI using the anti-Fc α-chain antibody
CRA-1 at 1 μg/mL (IgG1 mouse anti-human Fc α-chain from
eBioscience, San Diego, CA).

Preparation of cells for glycomic analyses
Cells were resuspended in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline,
transferred to a microfuge tube and pelleted at 800g. The super-
natant was aspirated and the cell pellet was stored at −80°C.

Reduction and carboxymethylation
Each cell sample ((cid:1)10 × 107 eosinophils, 15 × 106 mast cells
and 106 basophils) was sonicated in extraction buffer (25 mM
Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) and 1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-
propanesulfonate (CHAPS) at pH 7.4) and then dialyzed
against 4 × 4.5 L of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5,

19

SJ North et al.

at 4°C for 48 h as described (Sutton-Smith and Dell 2006).
After dialysis, the sample was lyophilized and then reduced in
1 mL of 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 2 mg/
mL of dithiothreitol. Reduction was performed under a nitro-
gen atmosphere at 37°C for 1 h. Carboxymethylation was
carried out by the addition of iodoacetic acid (5-fold molar
excess over dithiothreitol), and the reaction was allowed to
proceed under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature in
the dark for 2 h. Carboxymethylation was terminated by
dialysis against 4 × 4.5 L of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate,
pH 8.5, at 4°C for 48 h. After dialysis,
the sample was
lyophilized.

Tryptic digest
The reduced carboxymethylated proteins were digested with
tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) pretreated
bovine pancreas trypsin (EC3.4.21.4, Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset,
UK), for 16 h at 37°C in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate
buffer ( pH 8.4). The products were puriﬁed by C18-Sep-Pak
(Waters Corp., Elstree, UK) as described (Dell et al. 1994).

Sep-Pak® separation of released glycans from peptides
The reverse-phase C18 Sep-Pak cartridge was primed sequen-
tially with 5 mL of methanol, 5 mL of 5% acetic acid (v/v)
and 5 mL of propan-1-ol before being re-equilibrated with 10
mL of 5% acetic acid (v/v). The sample was then dissolved in
a minimum volume of 5% acetic acid (v/v) and loaded
directly onto the Sep-Pak. Elution was achieved using 3 mL
of 5% acetic acid (v/v), followed by 2 mL each of 20, 40, 60
and 100% propan-1-ol in 5% acetic acid (v/v). Each elution
step was collected, reduced in volume on a Speed Vac and
lyophilized (Dell et al. 1994).

PNGase F digestion of glycopeptides
PNGase F (EC3.5.1.52, Roche Molecular Biochemicals,
Lewes, UK) digestion was carried out
in 200 µL of
ammonium bicarbonate (50 mM, pH 8.5) for 16 h at 37°C
using 3 U of enzyme. The reaction was terminated by lyophi-
lization and the released N-glycans were separated from pep-
tides and O-glycopeptides by Sep-Pak C18 (Waters Corp.) as
described (Dell et al. 1994).

Sep-Pak® separation of permethylated glycans
The reverse-phase C18 Sep-Pak cartridge was primed sequen-
tially with 5 mL methanol, 5 mL water and 5 mL acetonitrile
before being re-equilibrated with 10 mL of water. The lyophi-
lized permethylated oligosaccharide sample was then dis-
solved in a minimum volume of methanol and loaded directly
onto the Sep–Pak. Elution was achieved using 3 mL of water
followed by 2 mL each of 15, 30, 50, 75 and 100% aceto-
nitrile in water (v/v). Each elution step was collected, reduced
in volume on a Speed Vac and lyophilized (Dell et al. 1994).

Derivatization for MALDI-TOF and tandem MS analysis
Permethylation was performed using the sodium hydroxide
procedure, as described (Dell et al. 1994). One gram of
sodium hydroxide pellets was crushed in a glass mortar with
3 mL of distilled, anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

20

One milliliter of the resulting slurry and 200 μL of methyl
iodide were added to the lyophilized sample. The mixture was
then shaken for 10 min before the reaction was quenched by
dropwise addition of water. The permethylated sample
was next extracted into 1 mL of chloroform and washed with
4 × 1 mL of water. The chloroform was then removed under a
stream of nitrogen.

Partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from
permethylated samples
for GC-MS linkage analysis as
described (Albersheim et al. 1967). The permethylated
glycans were hydrolyzed with 2 M triﬂuoroacetic acid for 2 h
at 121°C, reduced with 10 mg/mL of sodium borodeuteride in
2 M aqueous ammonium hydroxide at room temperature for
2 h, then acetylated with acetic anhydride at 100°C for 1 h.

Mass spectrometric analysis
MALDI-TOF data were acquired on a Voyager-DE STR mass
spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the
reﬂectron mode with delayed extraction. Permethylated
samples were dissolved in 10 µL of 80% (v/v) aqueous
methanol and 1 µL of dissolved sample was premixed with
1 µL of matrix [20 mg/mL of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in
80% (v/v) aqueous methanol], spotted onto a target plate and
dried under vacuum. Further MS/MS analyses of peaks
observed in the MS spectra were carried out using a 4800
MALDI-TOF/TOF (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer.
The potential difference between the source acceleration
voltage and the collision cell was set to 1 kV and argon was
used as collision gas. The 4700 Calibration Standard Kit,
calmix (Applied Biosystems), was used as the external cali-
brant for the MS mode and [Glu1] ﬁbrinopeptide B human
(Sigma-Aldrich) was used as an external calibrant for the MS/
MS mode. Data from the MALDI-MS glycomic experiments
are available in the CFG databases (http://www.functional
glycomics.org/glycomics/publicdata/glycoproﬁling-new.jsp).

GC-MS linkage analysis
GC-MS linkage analysis of partially methylated alditol acet-
ates were carried out using a Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 instru-
ment (PerkinElmer, Cambridgeshire, UK) ﬁtted with a RTX-5
fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm internal diam-
eter, Restek Corp., PA). The sample was dissolved in hexanes
and injected onto the column at 60°C. The column was main-
tained at this temperature for 1 min and then heated to 300°C
at a rate of 8°C/min.

Automated MS and MS/MS analysis
Annotation of the MS and MS/MS data was achieved with
assistance from the Cartoonist algorithm (Goldberg et al.
2005) and the GlycoWorkbench software suite (Ceroni et al.
2008).
