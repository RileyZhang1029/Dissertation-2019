Background: Campylobacter spp. are together with Salmonella spp. the leading causes of
human bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide.The most commonly isolated species in humans
are Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli. The isolation, identiﬁcation, and antimicrobial resis-
tance of Campylobacter spp. from poultry and raw meat from slaughterhouses, has been
investigated for the ﬁrst time in Greece. During the period from August 2005 to Novem-
ber 2008 a total of 1080 samples were collected: (a) 830 fecal samples from ﬁve poultry
farms, (b) 150 cecal samples from chicken carcasses in a slaughterhouse, and (c) 100 fecal
samples from one pig farm near the region of Attica. The identiﬁcation of the isolates was
performed with conventional (sodium hippurate hydrolysis and commercial identiﬁcation
system (Api CAMPY system, bioMerieux, France), as well as with and molecular methods
based on 16S rRNA species speciﬁc gene ampliﬁcation by PCR and subsequent sequence
analysis of the PCR products. Results: Sixteen Campylobacter strains were isolated, all
collected from the poultry farms. None of the strains was identiﬁed as C. jejuni. Antimicro-
bial susceptibility to six antimicrobials was performed and all the strains were susceptible
to ciproﬂoxacin, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, and gentamicin.Thirteen out of 14 C. coli were
resistant to erythromycin and all C. coli strains were resistant to ampicillin. Conclusion:
Our results emphasize the need for a surveillance and monitoring system with respect to
the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter in poultry, as well as for the
use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine in Greece.

INTRODUCTION
Campylobacter spp. are together with Salmonella spp. the leading
causes of human bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. The most
commonly isolated species in humans are Campylobacter jejuni,
C. coli, and C. lari, but other species like C. fetus, seem to be also
involved in human disease (Lastovica and Skirrow, 2000). Sporadic
human cases have been associated with consumption of under-
cooked poultry meat, while larger outbreaks are associated with
raw milk (Karagiannis et al., 2010; Denis et al., 2011). Contami-
nated drinking water has been the cause of sporadic cases, as well
as of larger outbreaks (Peterson, 2003). Antimicrobial resistance of
Campylobacter spp. to ﬂuoroquinolones, which are generally used
for the empiric treatment of bacterial gastroenteritis, has increased
during the past two decades, mainly as a result of the approval of
this group of antimicrobials for the use in food producing animals
(Nelson and Harris, 2006; Han et al., 2009). Macrolide-resistant
Campylobacter spp. isolated from food, animals, and humans have
also been reported (Kang et al., 2000; Belanger and Shryock, 2007;
Gallay et al., 2007). In Greece epidemiological data about the
prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Campylobacter spp.
are restricted to strains from clinical samples belonging mainly to

C. jejuni, isolated from children with gastroenteritis (Kafetzis et al.,
2001; Chatzipanagiotou et al., 2002, 2003a,b; Maraki et al., 2003;
Ioannidis et al., 2006; Papavasileiou et al., 2007).

There is, neither an ofﬁcial surveillance and monitoring sys-
tem for the presence of Campylobacter in animals, nor for the use
of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine. The aim of this study
was (1) to evaluate the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in pos-
itive samples in poultry meat, farms, and slaughterhouses; (2) to
report for the ﬁrst time the isolation, identiﬁcation, and antimicro-
bial resistance of Campylobacter spp. from poultry in Greece; and
(3) to investigate any possible epidemiological association with
previous reports referring to isolates from clinical cases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE COLLECTION
In the period from August 2005 to November 2008 a total of 1080
samples were collected from poultry farms, pig farms, and slaugh-
terhouses as follows: (a) 830 fecal samples from ﬁve poultry farms
near the region of Attica, (b) 150 cecal samples from chicken car-
casses in a slaughterhouse, and (c) 100 fecal samples from one pig
farm near the region of Attica.

All samples were collected with a sterile swab from fresh feces
immediately dropped to the ground. The sampling places covered
geographically the location of Sterea Ellada, which is situated in
Central Greece and includes the Department of Attica, the most
populous Department in Greece, and also the Departments of Vio-
tia, Evia, Evritania, Fthiotida, and Fokida. Thirteen percent of the
total Greek meat production is concentrated in this location and
ﬁve per cent in Attica.

At these locations, 61 poultry farms, 52 pig farms, and approxi-
mately 9 slaughterhouses are situated, most of them located in the
Department of Attica and Viotia (40 poultry farms, 29 pig farms,
and 4 slaughterhouses).

In this study, the method of two-stage cluster sampling was
used. Under the well known cluster sampling scheme the popu-
lation is divided in representative clusters, then a sample of these
clusters is randomly chosen and all the units contained in the cho-
sen clusters are deemed as the sample. The units within a cluster
should ideally be as heterogeneous as possible, but there should be
homogeneity between cluster means. Here we assume that there
is homogeneity between all the farms as well as all the slaughter-
houses since there are EU laws that impose a minimum level of
neatness.

Nevertheless, in our case the cluster sampling is not adequate,
since the units that are contained in each cluster are thousands,
thus we choose the method of two-stage cluster sampling. There
are many ways to modify cluster sampling for more complex sam-
pling situations. However, the most common modiﬁcation is to
take a sample of secondary units from within sampled primary
units (clusters) instead of inspecting every secondary unit within
each primary unit (cluster).

Speciﬁcally, let us suppose that a simple random sample of n
primary units is selected from a population of N primary units.
Then a simple random sample of secondary units of sizes m1, m2,
. . ., mn are selected from within these n primary units. The total
sample of m = (cid:2)
i=1 mi secondary units is called a two-stage
n
cluster sample. In two-stage cluster sampling, we select mi units
from the Mi secondary units (mi ≤ Mi) in primary unit i.

Speciﬁcally in our case, at the ﬁrst stage, we selected seven
clusters (each farm and slaughterhouse is deemed as a cluster),
which represent about the 5.75% of the total number of the farms
and slaughterhouses in the area under study (122 units in total
population). The seven clusters (ﬁve poultry farms, one pig farm,

and chicken carcasses) have a total animal population equal to
46000 animals (Table 1). At the second stage, from each one of the
seven clusters, random samples were selected. The distribution of
the samples taken from each cluster as well as the each cluster’s
estimated number of Campylobacter spp. positive strains are given

in Table 1 (an unbiased estimator of the unit total is ˆyi = Mi · ¯yi,
where ¯yi is cluster’s percentage rate).

CULTURE, ISOLATION, AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA
Campylobacter isolation and bacteriological identiﬁcation
The swabs were immediately inoculated into 10 mL transport
Campylobacter selective enrichment broth (Preston broth, Oxoid,
CM0067+ SR0084+ SR117E, Basingstoke, UK) and refrigerated
at 5˚C for a maximum of 2 h after sampling and before dispatch to
the laboratory.

The samples in Preston broth were incubated for 48 h at 42˚C
and were then subcultured onto Campylobacter selective Skir-
row agar (manufacturer Oxoid, CM169+ SR0069, Basingstoke
UK). The agar plates were further incubated at 42˚C under
microaerophilic conditions
(GENbox microaer, bioMerieux,
France).
glycerol at −80˚C for any further investigation.

All isolates were stored in brain heart infusion broth with 50%

The suspected colonies, showing typical morphology and pos-
itive oxidase and catalase reaction were microscopically exam-
ined after Gram-stain and typical isolates were primarily iden-
tiﬁed through sodium hippurate hydrolysis as well as by means
of a commercial
identiﬁcation system (Api CAMPY system,
bioMerieux, France).

Campylobacter sequence identiﬁcation
All isolates were further identiﬁed by a molecular method based
on 16S rRNA species speciﬁc gene ampliﬁcation by PCR and
subsequent sequence analysis of the PCR products.

DNA extraction and PCR.
Bacterial DNA was extracted
using the commercially available InstaGene matrix reagent
(6% Polystyrene divinylbenzene iminodiacetate in Aqua bides;
BioRad Laboratories, CA, USA). For
the PCR reaction
JumpStart REDTaq ReadyMix solution (Sigma Laborato-
ries, St. Louis, USA) was used. The following oligonu-
cleotide primer pairs were applied corresponding to three 16S

Campylobacter.
16S rRNA sequencing identiﬁcation The 16S
rRNA sequencing of the PCR products was performed by Macro-
gen Incorporation (908 World Meridian Center #60-24 Gasan-
dong, Geumcheon-Gu Seoul, Republic of Korea) and the analyzed
16S rRNA gene fragments were submitted to the GenBank (using
nucleotide BLAST) and compared with sequences already accessed
from other studies.

For the quality assessment of the method the following refer-
ence strains were used: C. jejuni 0:37 NCO 12539, C. jejuni 0:38
NCO 12540, C. jejuni 0:41 NCO 12542, C. coli NCO 11366, C. lari
NCO 11352.

CAMPYLOBACTER ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by using
the standard E-test method (AB Biodisk, Sweden). The
antibiotics included were nalidixic acid, ciproﬂoxacin, ampi-
cillin, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, gentamicin, and erythromycin.
The bacterial inoculum was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland stan-
dard turbidity and Mueller–Hinton agar supplemented with 5%
lysed sheep blood were used. Plates were incubated at 37˚C
for 48 h under microaerophilic conditions. Results were inter-
preted according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Insti-
tute (CLSI) guidelines (CLSI document M45-A and M100-S17;
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2006, 2007) using
the following resistance breakpoints of C. jejuni/coli: ampicillin
>16 mg/L, ciproﬂoxacin >4 mg/L, gentamicin >16 mg/L, ery-
thromycin >32 mg/L, nalidixic acid >32 mg/L, and amoxicillin–
clavulanic acid >16 mg/L).

The following reference strains were used as controls: C. jejuni
0:37 NCO 12539, C. jejuni 0:38 NCO 12540, C. jejuni 0:41 NCO
12542, C. coli NCO 11366, C. lari NCO 11352.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For the analysis the statistical package SPSS (version 18) was
used. The chi-square test was the statistical method used (as a
distribution goodness of ﬁt test).

The chi-square test is used when we are interested as to how
well a model actually reﬂects empirical data. Speciﬁcally, when we
are interested in how “close” the observed values are to those which
would be expected under a theoretical model. In our case, we used

it in order to analyze multi-category percentages (e.g., test the null
hypothesis that the percentage of Campylobacter strains isolated
in poultry farms was equal to the percentages of Campylobacter
strains isolated in farm pigs and chicken carcasses).

Details about the chi-square test (as a distribution goodness of
ﬁt test) are given in Armitage et al. (2002). Finally, the signiﬁcance
of the test was set equal to 0.05.

RESULTS
CAMPYLOBACTER ISOLATION
From the total of 1080 collected samples 16 Campylobacter strains
were isolated: (a) 16 out of 830 fecal samples (1.93%) from the
ﬁve poultry farms, (b) none out of the 150 cecal samples from
chicken carcasses, and (c) none out of the 100 fecal samples from
the pig farm (Table 2). According to the statistical analysis the
percentage of Campylobacter strains isolated in poultry farms was
signiﬁcantly different (p-value <0.05%) from the percentage of
Campylobacter strains isolated from the farm pigs and chicken
carcasses.

CAMPYLOBACTER BACTERIOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION
All isolated strains were negative for sodium hippurate hydrolysis.
Through the commercial identiﬁcation system (Api CAMPY) only
7 out of the 16 isolated strains were identiﬁed: four as C. coli, two
as C. lari, and one as Arcobacter cryaerophilus.

CAMPYLOBACTER SEQUENCING IDENTIFICATION
The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis identiﬁed all the strains as
follows: 14 C. coli and 2 C. jejuni subsp. doylei (Table 2). The
accession numbers of the nucleotide sequences admitted to Gen-
Bank are shown in Table 3. In addition, the statistical analysis
revealed that the percentage of C. coli strains isolated in total was
signiﬁcantly different (p-value <0.05%) from the percentage of
the isolated C. jejuni subsp. doylei.

CAMPYLOBACTER ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING
The results for antimicrobial susceptibility in relation to species
and origin are shown in Table 4. All the strains were susceptible to
ciproﬂoxacin and amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, while 13 were resis-
tant to erythromycin, 14 to ampicillin, 2 to nalidixic acid, and 2 to
gentamicin.

Our study is the ﬁrst report ever published from Greece, refer-
ring to the isolation, identiﬁcation, and antimicrobial resistance of

Campylobacter in food animals

Campylobacter spp. from poultry farms. To our knowledge there
are only a few published data from Greece upon the infection rate
of Campylobacter spp. in human sporadic cases. Kafetzis et al.
(2001) isolated Campylobacter spp. in 9% of 294 stool samples of
hospitalized children, Maraki et al. (2003) isolated Campylobacter
spp. in 4.2% from 7090 human stool samples, and Gousia et al.
(2011) reported the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. of raw and
processed meat products from retail shops.

In the present study, the isolation rate of positive samples of
Campylobacter spp. in the examined poultry farms and in the
total of samples was 1.93 and 1.48% respectively, which is low
compared to those reported from other countries. In 2009, a total
of 24 countries reported data about the presence of Campylobac-
ter in broiler ﬂocks (Scientiﬁc Report of European Food Safety
Authority, 2011) and the recorded rates of positive samples were
variable, ranging from 0 to 100.0%. Low and moderate levels were
only observed in Estonia, Finland, Sweden, and Norway and high
levels (>50%) were observed in Austria, France, Romania, and
Spain. In the present study, we did not isolate any strain of Campy-
lobacter spp. from chicken carcasses and farm pigs and this might
be due to good hygiene practices in the slaughterhouse we visited,
including daily cleaning and disinfection of the equipment used,
existence of sufﬁcient air system ventilation, and use of appropriate

clothes (Young et al., 2010). Likewise, we did not isolate any strain
of C. jejuni and this could explain the fact that so far no out-
breaks due to Campylobacter spp. have been notiﬁed in Greece,
as all the hitherto reported cases are sporadic and community
acquired. The lack of outbreaks can also be explained by the fact
that according to the Greek alimentary customs, meat is always
well-cooked.

As shown by the results in Table 1, there are 285 estimated pos-
itive samples in the 7 primary sampling units (40.71 in each unit
on average). Thus, the estimated prevalence rate of Campylobacter
spp. positive animals was 0.622%. An upper bound for preva-
lence rate, with 95% conﬁdence, is approximately 1.226%, while
a lower bound is zero. For estimating prevalence rate and conﬁ-
dence intervals, appropriate estimators were used, corresponding
to the sampling scheme that was applied (Cochran, 1977; Kish,
1995). In the total of 122 poultry/pig farms and slaughterhouses
(which are situated in the examined location of Greece), 4967.2
animals are expected to be found as positive for Campylobac-
ter spp. in the total estimated population of 801715 animals.
These ﬁgures were estimated using appropriate estimators cor-
responding to the multistage sampling scheme that was applied
(combining and weighting the n independent unbiased estimates
ˆyi provides us with an unbiased estimate of the population total
t = N
ˆyi = 122 · 40.71 ≈ 4967.2 while the prevalence ratio
is calculated by the dividing 4967.2 by the estimated total number
of units in all the clusters which is 801715).

In the poultry samples, C. coli was prevailing with 14 out of 16
strains, a relatively high rate compared to other studies from Euro-
pean countries and the USA (Atanassova et al., 2007; Han et al.,
2009). This predominance could be speciﬁc for the geographical
region we visited and might be different in other Greece regions.
Besides, the present survey was performed in a speciﬁc region
near Athens and that could explain a probable clonality of the
strains, which might be not representative of the general animal
population. In our case another reason could be the protein-based
broilers feed, which inﬂuences the digestive bacterial ﬂora equilib-
rium of chickens. Previous reports showed that the ceca of birds
that receive plant protein-based feed are less likely to be colonized
with C. jejuni, than the ceca of birds that receive other types of
feed (Udayamputhoor et al., 2003).

There was a remarkable discrepancy in the identiﬁcation of
Campylobacter strains between biotyping by the commercial Api
CAMPY system and the molecular methods. In our study as
well as in previous reports, the 16S rRNA gene sequencing was
shown to be the most suitable test for the identiﬁcation of the less
common Campylobacter spp. (Al Amri et al., 2007; Caner et al.,
2008).

Campylobacter in food animals

Regarding the antimicrobial susceptibility, there was a remark-
ably high resistance rate to erythromycin and ampicillin of C.
coli isolates from poultry farms (92.85 and 100% respectively).
Unfortunately, there is no surveillance and monitoring system
for the notiﬁcation of antibiotic use in veterinary medicine and
together with the possibility that antibiotics were administered
to animals for growth, the possible use of erythromycin, and
ampicillin in poultry can only be an assumption. The poten-
tial use of ampicillin and erythromycin in veterinary medicine
or for animal growth could increase the prevalence of high-
resistant C. coli strains in poultry farms. On the other hand, C.
coli isolates are generally more resistant than C. jejuni strains
(Gallay et al., 2007). According to a pan–European survey upon
the antimicrobial susceptibility of Campylobacter spp. isolated
from chickens (de Jong et al., 2009), 60.2% of the isolated C.
coli isolates were resistant to ciproﬂoxacin, 61.4% to nalidixic
acid, 12.0% to erythromycin, and 1.2% to gentamicin. Macrolide
resistance is based on mechanisms including target modiﬁcation
by point mutation or methylation of 23S rRNA gene, hydrol-
ysis of the drug, and efﬂux pumps (Belanger and Shryock,
2007). Since no transmission of erythromycin resistance genes
through plasmid mechanism has been described so far, either
among strains of the same Campylobacter species, or of different
Campylobacter species, it seems that no clear association could be
assumed, between the use of macrolides in veterinary medicine

the strains was resistant

and the emergence of macrolide-resistant Campylobacter strains
in humans.
None of

to ciproﬂoxacin and
amoxicillin–clavulanic acid. Two C. coli isolates from the poul-
try farms were resistant to nalidixic acid and susceptible to
ciproﬂoxacin, a phenotype which could be considered as a type
2 mutant being previously described (Reina et al., 1994; Ioannidis
et al., 2009).

CONCLUSION
identiﬁcation, and antimicrobial resistance of
The isolation,
Campylobacter spp. from poultry farms and slaughterhouses has
been investigated and reported for the ﬁrst time in Greece. The
results showed a low prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in a geo-
graphical region around Athens, with the predominance of C. coli.
There was a remarkably high resistance rate of C. coli isolates from
poultry farms to ampicillin and erythromycin, indicating the pos-
sible use of erythromycin and ampicillin in poultry. Our results
also emphasize the need for a surveillance and monitoring system
for the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter
in poultry and other food animals.
