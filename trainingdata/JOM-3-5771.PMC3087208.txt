Pathogenesis and treatment of oral
candidosis

Oral infections caused by yeast of the genus Candida and particularly Candida albicans (oral candidoses) have
been recognised throughout recorded history. However, since the 1980s a clear surge of interest and associated
research into these infections have occurred. This has largely been due to an increased incidence of oral
candidosis over this period, primarily because of the escalation in HIV-infection and the AIDS epidemic. In
addition, changes in medical practice leading to a greater use of invasive clinical procedures and a more
widespread use of immunosuppressive therapies have also contributed to the problem. Whilst oral candidosis
has previously been considered to be a disease mainly of the elderly and very young,
its occurrence
throughout the general population is now recognised. Candida are true ‘opportunistic pathogens’ and only
instigate oral infection when there is an underlying predisposing condition in the host. Treatment of these
infections has continued (and in some regards continues) to be problematic because of the potential toxicity
of traditional antifungal agents against host cells. The problem has been compounded by the emergence of
Candida species other than C. albicans that have inherent resistance against traditional antifungals. The aim
of this review is to give the reader a contemporary overview of oral candidosis, the organisms involved, and
the management strategies that are currently employed or could be utilised in the future.

The Candida genus is comprised of over 150 species

of asporogenous ‘yeast-like’ fungi. Members of
this genus are ubiquitously distributed, persisting
as saprophytes in soil and aquatic environments, as well as
colonising several animal reservoirs (13). The majority of
Candida species are unable to grow at 378C and are,
therefore, not normally associated with human colonisa-
tion (4). However several species do persist as commensal
microorganisms within humans and these can act
as opportunistic pathogens in debilitated individuals
(Table 1). Candida albicans is the species most frequently
associated with normal oral carriage in humans, occurring
in the mouths of up to 80% of healthy individuals (13).

A change from the harmless commensal existence of
Candida to a pathogenic state can occur following
alteration of the oral cavity environment to one that
favours the growth of Candida. The causes of such
changes are the so-called predisposing factors for Can-
dida infection (candidosis) and most often these relate to
a weakening of host immune defences (Table 2).

Infections caused by Candida are most frequently
superficial, occurring on moist mucosal surfaces in
individuals suffering with a mild debilitation. In severely
immunocompromised patients, infections can be systemic

and are significant because of their associated high
mortality. To highlight this, in intensive care unit patients
the mortality rate for individuals with systemic candido-
sis is approximately 3050% (24).

Recent decades have seen a significant increase in the
incidence of all forms of candidosis and this reflects
changes in medical practice with a greater use of invasive
surgical procedures, a more widespread use of immuno-
suppressive therapies as well as broad-spectrum antibio-
tics. Key to the increase in oral candidosis has, however,
been the escalation of HIV-infection and AIDs (25).

The most prevalent Candida species involved in human
infection is C. albicans. In oral candidosis, C. albicans
generally accounts for around 50% of cases (26, 27) and
whilst a similar prevalence of C. albicans occurs in
systemic candidosis, in recent years higher incidences of
non-C. albicans Candida (NCAC) species have been
reported (28, 29). The reasons for the increasing in-
cidence of NCAC species in human infection are multi-
factorial and undoubtedly improved diagnostic methods,
changes in medical practices such as the more widespread
use of invasive medical procedures (e.g. use of indwelling
catheters, organ transplants) and immunosuppressive
therapy may all have facilitated increased rates (30).

Oral candidosis is not a single infection and generally
four primary oral forms are described based on clinical
presentation (Fig. 1). Pseudomembranous candidosis
(oral thrush) presents as creamy white lesions on the
oral mucosa and a diagnostic feature of this infection is
that these plaques can be removed by gentle scraping
leaving behind an underlying erythematous mucosal
surface (31, 32). Histological examination of recovered
pseudomembranes reveals desquamated epithelial cells
together with yeast and filamentous forms of Candida.
The infection has traditionally been regarded as an acute
condition often affecting newborn babies where there is
an immature immune system. In older individuals, acute
pseudomembranous candidosis often occurs when there
is a nutritional limitation, local immune suppression (e.g.
steroid inhaler administration for
the treatment of
asthma), or an underlying disease most notably HIV-
infection and AIDS (26, 33, 34).

In the case of AIDS, or other instances where the
individual
is immunocompromised long-term, chronic
pseudomembranous candidosis can develop and whilst
antifungal therapy can temporarily resolve the condition,
recurrent infection is frequent. Of additional concern
with chronic forms of pseudomembranous candidosis is
the subsequent progression of infection to oesophageal
involvement, which in turn can lead to difficulties in
swallowing and chest pains.

In addition to pseudomembranous candidosis, another
acute form of Candida infection is acute erythematous
candidosis. This form of oral candidosis frequently occurs
after receipt of a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which, by
lowering the oral bacterial population, facilitates subse-
quent overgrowth of Candida by alleviating competitive
pressures. The infection can occur on the buccal mucosa,
but most frequently presents as reddened lesions on the
dorsum of the tongue and also the palate (32, 35).
Erythematous candidosis is the only form of oral candi-
dosis that is consistently painful. Where antibiotic treat-
ment has been associated with predisposition, cessation of

treatment leads to spontaneous resolution of the lesions
once the bacterial population of the mouth recovers to
pretreatment levels (22).

Chronic forms of erythematous candidosis can also
occur and traditionally these infections encompassed the
atrophic lesions associated with angular cheilitis and
denture stomatitis. However, both infections are also
linked to bacterial colonisation and, therefore, these are
now often categorised under Candida-associated lesions
(see later). Chronic erythematous candidosis is prevalent
in HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients, and
depending on the study can represent over a third of
the Candida lesions encountered (36).

Chronic hyperplastic candidosis (occasionally referred
to as candidal
leukoplakia) can present on any oral
mucosal surface and appears either as smooth (homo-
genous) or nodular white lesions (37). Unlike the lesions
of pseudomembranous candidosis,
those of chronic
hyperplastic candidosis cannot be removed by gentle
scraping. Most frequently, chronic hyperplastic candido-
sis occurs bilaterally in the commissural regions of the
buccal mucosa with highest prevalence in middle-aged
men who are smokers (38). A characteristic feature of this
form of oral candidosis is the penetration of the oral
epithelium by C. albicans hyphae, which are detected in
biopsy sections following Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) or
equivalent staining methods (Fig. 2). Histological exam-
ination is indeed the diagnostic tool for this infection and
in addition to the presence of Candida hyphae, an
inflammatory cell infiltrate is invariably present within
the lamina propria together with marked variations in
epithelial thickness (39). An important feature of chronic
hyperplastic candidosis is its possible association with
malignant transformation (40). A confirmed link between
Candida and the development of oral cancer remains
to be established, although it has been shown in vitro
that yeast can generate the carcinogenic nitrosamine,

intraoral candidosis and where the Candida load is
already high.

Secondary forms of oral candidosis can also occur and
are frequently described as Candida-associated lesions.
Angular cheilitis is a condition where lesions manifest at
the angles of the mouth and microbiological sampling of
these sites frequently reveal the presence of C. albicans,
often in combination with the bacterium Staphylococcus
aureus (42). The exact role of Candida in this infection
remains unclear, but it is worth noting that angular
cheilitis often occurs in patients with existing forms of

hyperplastic candidosis. Typical invading hypha indicated by

Median rhomboid glossitis is a chronic condition that
presents as a diamond-shaped lesion at the posterior
midline on the dorsum of the tongue (31). High levels of
Candida can be recovered from these lesions, which are
often associated with individuals who frequently use
steroid inhalers or who are tobacco smokers (43).

The most prevalent oral infection involving Candida is
Candida-associated denture stomatitis, which occurs in
up to 65% of denture wearers, often asymptomatically
(44). As this name suggests, denture wearing is the
major predisposing factor, particularly in cases where
the denture is not adequately cleansed or is retained
overnight in the oral cavity. Under these conditions, the
stagnant area above the upper fitting surface of the
denture provides an ideal environment for the growth of
Candida, which is adept at adhering to acrylic used as the
base material for the denture (45). Furthermore, the
limited flow of saliva at this location means that loosely
adherent Candida may not be efficiently removed from
the site, as would be the case at other oral locations. In
situations where there is an ill-fitting denture, frictional
irritation can damage the normally protective mucosal
barrier, allowing infiltration of Candida into the tissue
thereby promoting infection.

Candida have also been associated with linear gingival
erythema, which, whilst rare, is occasionally seen in HIV-
infected patients (46, 47). The precise role of Candida in

this condition remains to be confirmed, which may in
part be due to the frequent use of systemic antifungal
agents in HIV patients.

In a discussion on the oral

forms of candidosis,
mention needs to be made of chronic mucocutaneous
candidosis (CMC), characterised by the widespread
occurrence of superficial candidosis of the skin, nails,
and mucosal membranes (including those of the oral
cavity) of infected individuals (48, 49). CMC is primarily
associated with disorders
resulting in the incorrect
functioning of T-lymphocytes (48).

Candida virulence factors
Given the high prevalence of Candida as a harmless
commensal in humans, it is not surprising that no single
primary virulence factor has been identified with the
organism. However, a number of putative virulence
factors (Table 3) have been proposed that in the event
of host debilitation contribute to tissue damage and
persistence of the organism within the host.

The ability of Candida to adhere to host surfaces is a
prerequisite for both successful commensal carriage as
well as persistence during active infection. Within the oral
cavity, removal of
loosely attached Candida by the
physical flushing action of salivary flow or the process
of sloughing off of epithelial cells from mucosal surfaces
are important factors in host defence against Candida
overgrowth. An enhanced ability to overcome these
removal mechanisms can therefore be regarded as a
virulence attribute.

Adherence of Candida to human epithelial cells is
initiated through weak and reversible interactions invol-
ving hydrophobic and electrostatic forces (50). The nature
of
these forces are in part governed by the local
environment in the oral cavity; however, studies have
shown that strain variation does occur in terms of cell
surface hydrophobicity that may give certain isolates
greater pathogenic potential (51).

Specific adhesion between Candida and receptors on
host tissues results in a stronger covalent attachment.
Candida genes of the ALS (agglutinin-like sequence)
family (52) and also HWP1 (hyphal wall protein) (53)
encodes for cell wall associated glycoproteins that pro-
mote adhesion of C. albicans to epithelial surfaces. In
addition, specific interaction of Candida with oral bacteria
has also been demonstrated that could encourage biofilm
formation on dentures and in dental plaque (54).

Biofilms can be defined as microbial communities that
are often (but not necessarily) attached to a solid surface;
invariably the biofilm microorganisms are encased within
an extracellular polysaccharide matrix that has been
generated by the organisms themselves. Candida species
are adept at forming biofilms (55, 56) and this has been
linked to both increased expression of virulence factors
(57) as well as reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial
agents (58). Candida biofilms in human disease are widely
recognised and occur on tissue surfaces as well as the
biomaterials of medical devices. Candida biofilms on
artificial voice box prostheses have been identified as a
major cause of their failure. Urinary tract infections
caused by Candida biofilms in catheterised patients are
recognised, whilst biofilms at other sites including on
prosthetic heart valves,
intravascular catheters, and
replacement joints have also been linked with infection
(59). Candidal biofilms in haemodialysis and peritoneal
dialysis catheters are a common occurrence and asso-
ciated with an infection rate of up to 20% in patients
undergoing treatment (55).

In terms of oral candidosis, biofilms on an oral
prosthesis, most commonly a denture, are a major
predisposing factor to chronic oral candidosis. Candida
readily adhere to the polymethylacrylate material of
dentures, and also exploit micro fissures and cracks
within the material to facilitate retention (60). Biofilm
formation on denture surfaces is further promoted by

might aid in evading recognition by adaptive immune
responses as well as promoting biofilm formation.

Pathogenesis and treatment of oral candidosis

Several Candida species are described as polymorpho-
genic (61) and whilst in nutrient rich culture media at
378C, yeast growth would appear to be prevalent,
filamentous growth can occur and indeed is frequently
seen in clinical situations. Both C. albicans and Candida
dubliniensis are species associated with the generation of
true hyphae (62). True hyphae are distinct from pseudo-
hyphae (which are effectively elongated yeast cells), as the
former lack constriction at yeast/hyphal junctions and
also possess septa within the filaments (Fig. 3). The
pathogenic significance of being able to produce hyphae
could relate to the greater resistance of hyphae to
phagocytosis compared with yeast, enhanced adherence
to host surfaces, and the ability of hyphae to invade
epithelial
layers resulting in tissue damage (Fig. 2).
Hyphal production is also linked with enhanced expres-
sion of several putative virulence genes, some of which
are not involved in the morphogenic process itself (63). It
should be noted that both filamentous and yeast forms
are encountered in the oral cavity of healthy individuals,
highlighting the importance of host factors in controlling
Candida and the fact
that no single predominant
virulence factor is associated with the organism (64).

A phenomenon referred to as ‘high frequency pheno-
typic switching’ is evident in vitro for certain strains of C.
albicans when cultured on appropriate agar media.
Colonies generated by isolates that are ‘high frequency
switchers’ exhibit variation in terms of colour, shape, and
translucency. The cause of these colony switch variants
relates to cell morphology and differential gene expres-
sion by the variants (56, 61). The so-called white-opaque
switching is associated with mating in C. albicans as
well as the up-regulation of biofilm genes (65, 66). High
frequency switching strains have been proposed to have
greater virulence, as replication of this property in vivo

Candida produces several extracellular enzymes that
could have a locally damaging effect on host structures
(67). Significant attention has been given to the secreted
aspartyl proteinases (SAPs) of Candida. C. albicans
possesses at least 10 different genes that encode for
SAPs, and the resulting proteins are in turn designated
SAPs 110. SAPs 18 are released extracellularly,
whilst SAPs 9 and 10 are thought to be membrane
bound. SAP enzymes belong to the same class of
proteinases as the HIV aspartyl proteinase as well as
human pepsin and renin. All Candida SAPs are inhibited
by the agent pepstatin A. Candida SAPs have optimal
activity at acidic pH (pH 27 activity range), although
distinct differences in pH optima are evident with SAPs
13 being most active at the lower end of the pH scale
and SAPs 46 at higher pH. This heterogeneity in activity
optima of the SAPs could benefit Candida in its survival
under different environmental conditions. Of the Candida
SAPs, the most widely studied are SAPs 16. From
research it has been shown that SAP 2 is induced when
C. albicans is cultured in media containing proteins as
the only nitrogen source (68). SAP 1 and SAP 3 are
specifically expressed during switching of C. albicans,
whilst SAPs 46 are involved in promoting hyphal growth
(69). C. albicans proteinases have keratinolytic activity
that can both serve to facilitate initial penetration of
keratinised cells as well as providing a valuable source of
nitrogen during colonisation (70, 71).

In terms of virulence, SAP activity can therefore
directly induce damage to host cells, facilitate hyphal
growth for invasion of tissue, increase adherence follow-
ing exposure of receptor sites, and also degrade host
immunoglobulins and other defence proteins (55, 7275).
Another group of hydrolytic enzymes produced by
Candida species are the phospholipases (PLs) and seven
distinct encoding genes have been identified in C. albicans.
These genes have been given the designations PLA,
PLB1, PLB2, PLC1, PLC2, PLC3, and PLD1 (76).
Through the hydrolysis of ester linkages of phospholipids,
PLs can effectively degrade the membrane of host cells
leading to cell
lysis and death. By this process, both
adherence of Candida to receptor sites and its subsequent
penetration of damaged tissue can be facilitated.

The role of extracellular lipase and esterase production
by Candida in pathogenic processes is less well understood
(77). Both lipases and esterases share the ability to
hydrolyse the ester bonds in glycerides, although the latter
only act on soluble substrate molecules. A total of 10
Candida lipase (LIP110) genes have been identified in
C. albicans and sequence-related genes found in C.
tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. krusei (78). Lipases of
C. albicans have recently been shown to exhibit cytotoxic

effects on host cells (79) and LIP gene expression detected
in oral candidosis (80).

Haemolysins are substances that lyse red blood cells and
their production by Candida is considered an important
attribute in promoting survival within the host through an
increased ability to sequester iron. Luo et al. (81) demon-
strated a- and b-haemolysis by clinical
isolates of
C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. zeyla-
noides, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. lusitaniae. Candida
haemolysin production positively correlates with glucose
concentration and that this could be a predisposing factor
in candidosis of poorly controlled diabetics where higher
blood and salivary glucose levels occurs (76, 82).

Host response to oral candidosis
Immunocompetent individuals rarely suffer from oral
candidosis even when Candida is present in the oral
cavity. Prevention of mucosal
infection by Candida is
mediated primarily by the functions of the innate immune
response. In particular, neutrophils and macrophages are
key to successful phagocytosis and killing of Candida.
Professional phagocytes recognise Candida through pat-
tern recognition receptors (PRRs), which interact with
specific molecules (pathogen-associated molecular pat-
terns; PAMPs) exposed on the surface of Candida (83).
Following recognition, these cells release cytokines and
chemokines to further modulate the immune response.
Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting
cells that provide a sentinel role in mucosal
tissue.
Interaction of DCs with Candida leads to DC activation
and phagocytosis. Following phagocytosis, DCs migrate
to the lymph nodes where the Candida antigen is
processed and presented on the surface of the DC to
naı¨ve CD4 T-cells (8488). Interaction between DCs
and T-cells cause the latter to differentiate into mature
effective T-cells (89). The type of T-cell generated is
thought to be under direction of the DC and examples of
effective T-cells include T-helper 1 (Th1), T-helper 2
(Th2), T-helper 17 (Th17), and regulatory T-cells (Tregs).
Previously it was generally accepted that a Th1 elicited
response was a protective one, whilst Th2 responses were
implicated in infection. More recently, evidence suggests
that a Th17 response is predominant in protection of
mucosal surfaces (90).

Treatment and management of oral candidosis
A priority in the treatment of oral candidosis is the
alleviation of any identifiable predisposing factor. Acquir-
ing a thorough medical history is, therefore, an essential
component in the management process. An example of
this are the recommendations made to patients suffering
from chronic erythematous candidosis in order to improve
oral hygiene through adequate denture cleansing. Such
recommendations would include the regular and frequent
use of a denture cleanser with anti-candidal properties

such as 1% sodium hypochlorite preparations, together
with the removal of dentures overnight. Chlorhexidine
(0.2%) should be used if the denture has metal compo-
nents since hypochlorite will otherwise cause discoloura-
tion. However, it should also be noted that discolouration
of teeth and mucosal surfaces have been reported with the
use of chlorhexidine (91).

Certain predisposing factors are, however, more diffi-
cult if not impossible to eradicate such as where there is
an underlying disease (e.g. leukaemia or AIDS). In these
cases, targeted antifungal therapy, as discussed later,
plays an important role in the management strategy.

tooth brushing may be more

Both the physical and chemical reduction of Candida
load in the oral cavity can be achieved by good oral
hygiene practices including tooth brushing and the use of
antimicrobial mouthwashes. Manual tooth brushing is
limited to accessible oral surfaces, although powered or
electrical
effective
as cavitation within surrounding fluids could disrupt
Candida biofilms at otherwise inaccessible sites (92).
Several mouthwashes exhibit anti-candidal activity in-
cluding triclosan, chlorhexidine gluconate, and essential
oil formulations. The latter tend to contain natural plant
extracts such as thymol, eucalyptol, and bioflavanoids
and these can have a direct anti-candidal activity in vitro
through cell membrane disruption and enzyme inhibition
(93, 94).

When compared with antibacterial agents, the avail-
ability of antifungal agents is significantly lower. The
reason for this relates to the relatively recent recognition
of the significance of human fungal infections and also
the fact that fungal organisms are eukaryotic and share
many features with mammalian cells making selection of
suitable targets for antifungal agents problematic. Classi-
fication of antifungal agents is based on the target of
activity, and in the treatment of candidosis the two classes
most commonly used are the polyenes and the azoles
(Table 4).

Polyenes include the drugs amphotericin B and nysta-
tin and their mode of action is through direct binding to
the sterol ergosterol found within fungal cell membranes.
Polyene binding to ergosterol induces leakage of cyto-
plasmic contents leading to fungal cell death (95). The
equivalent mammalian sterol is cholesterol, which has a
lower binding affinity for polyenes and this makes host
cells less susceptible to their toxic effects. Nevertheless, at
higher therapeutic concentrations polyenes do exhibit a
degree of toxicity in humans. The use of polyenes is
limited further as they are poorly absorbed through the
gut and, therefore, topical application in the form of
lozenges and oral suspensions are the principle means of
administration in oral infection. Polyenes are frequently
used in the treatment of chronic erythematous candidosis,
and oral suspension of amphotericin B may be employed

in treating refractory oral candidosis frequently seen in
HIV-infected and AIDs patients.

Unlike the polyenes, azole antifungals are fungistatic
rather than fungicidal (96). The mechanism of action is
by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol demethylase that is a
cytochrome P-450 3-A dependent enzyme involved in the
synthesis of ergosterol. Subsequent depletion of ergos-
terol in the fungal cell results in inhibition of fungal
growth and impairment of membrane permeability. Since
azoles are fungistatic, complete resolution of the infection
will be aided by simultaneously addressing predisposing
host factors. The two most frequently administered azole
antifungals in the treatment of oral candidosis are
fluconazole and itraconazole and these drugs have the
advantage of being readily absorbed through the gut with
the result that oral administration is an effective means of
delivery (97). Furthermore, fluconazole is secreted in high
levels in saliva making the agent particularly suitable for
treating oral infection (98).

Unfortunately, in recent years Candida resistance to
azole antifungals has been detected and this can arise
through several mechanisms including the over produc-

tion of the lanosterol demethylase enzyme, an alteration
in the demethylase enzyme structure that makes it less
susceptible to azole inhibition, the use of multi-drug
transporter pumps to remove azoles from the cell, and the
incorporation of alternative sterols to ergosterol within
the cell membrane (99). Several NCAC species are
inherently more resistant to azoles than other species.
For example, 35% and 75% of C. glabrata and C. krusei
isolates exhibit resistance to fluconazole and this could be
a reason why the prevalence of certain NCAC species in
human disease has increased in recent years (29, 100).

As the need to expand antifungal options increases,
newer azole drugs such as itraconazole have been used in
the treatment of oral candidosis, whilst others including
voriconazole and pozoconazole are alternatives
for
invasive infections by Candida. Recently, the echinocan-
din class of antifungals have emerged as alternatives to
the azoles and polyenes (101). Echinocandins act through
inhibition of the D-glucan synthase, which is an enzyme
required for the synthesis of the fungal cell wall. This
enzyme is absent from mammalian cells thereby reducing
potential host cell toxicity. Whilst echinocandins such as

caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin are fungici-
dal against Candida, their use is somewhat limited by
their large molecular size that dictates the need for
intravenous administration. Echinocandins are again
primarily used in the treatment of
invasive fungal
infections.

Successful treatment of candidosis can be hampered
where there is an established biofilm. Candida biofilms
exhibit significantly higher tolerance to both antimicro-
bial mouthwashes and also traditional antifungal agents.
As a consequence, alternative strategies have been
suggested to combat such infections. These have included
the modification of biomaterials such as those used in
denture prosthesis to inhibit adherence of Candida.
Examples include the use of coatings with silanes,
chlorhexidine, histatins, antifungals, as well as
the
incorporation of surface-modifying groups (102105).
Alternative
could exploit quorum-sensing
agents to promote biofilm disruption with the agent
farnesol already having been shown to induce instability
in Candida biofilms (106). Other possible strategies could
involve the use of probiotics (107), which would induce
an added microbiological pressure on Candida within the
oral cavity and may also promote local immune function.
The potential benefits of probiotics in the management of
Candida biofilms have already been reported for indwel-
ling voice box prostheses (108), as well as in lowering the
Candida prevalence in the oral cavity (109).

Summary
Whilst Candida species are frequent members of the
commensal oral microflora of humans, they are oppor-
tunistic pathogens that under conditions of host debilita-
tion can cause a spectrum of oral
infection. Oral
candidoses have been recognised throughout recorded
history, although most attention has been given to the
infections in the last few decades when the incidence
increased greatly with the advent and escalation of the
AIDs epidemic. C. albicans is the species most frequently
implicated in oral candidosis, although other species are
increasingly being encountered. Putative virulence factors
of Candida include the ability to adhere to host surfaces,
produce filamentous growth forms, and release hydrolytic
enzymes capable of
inducing damage to host cells.
Effective management of oral candidosis demands cor-
rection of any identified predisposing factor together with
the administration of appropriate antifungal agents.
Given the increasing incidence of NCAC species in oral
infection and the development of resistance against some
of the traditionally used antifungals, there is a constant
need for research into new and effective agents to treat
oral candidosis.
