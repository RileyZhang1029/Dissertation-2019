Abstract
Over the past half century, remarkable progress has been made in understanding the biological basis
of memory and how it changes over the lifespan. An important conceptual advance during this period
was the realization that normative cognitive trajectories can exist independently of dementing illness.
In fact, mammals as different as rats and monkeys, who do not spontaneously develop Alzheimer’s
disease, show memory impairments at advanced ages in similar domains as those observed in older
humans. Thus, animal models have been particularly helpful in revealing brain mechanisms responsible
for the cognitive changes that occur in aging. During these past decades, a number of empirical and
technical advances enabled the discoveries that began to link age-related changes in brain function to
behavior. The pace of innovation continues to accelerate today, resulting in an expanded window
through which the secrets of the aging brain are being deciphered.

Defining normative aging
Only 40 years ago it was widely believed that if you lived
long enough, you would eventually experience serious
cognitive decline, particularly with respect to memory.
The implication for cognition was that achieving an
advanced age was effectively equivalent to becoming
senile—a word that implies mental defects or a dement-
ing illness. As a graduate student during that era, I was
curious why such conclusions were being drawn about
the elderly—especially since there appeared to be striking
exceptions to this description of cognitive aging. A great-
grandmother and great-aunt on my father’s side, for
example, were fun to be with, exceptionally active and
quick witted. A closer look at the extant literature did not
give me confidence that either the biological basis of
memory or how it might be expected to change with age
was well understood. An explosion of discoveries were
made over the intervening years—including major
breakthroughs in understanding how memory is stored
and retrieved by the brain. This along with other factors
resulted in a major conceptual shift away from the view
of “aging as a disease” and towards the view of “aging as
a risk factor” for a number of neurological diseases. This

encourages examination of the question of why some
show successful aging trajectories that include perhaps
annoying, but relatively minor, cognitive change, while
others show significant and disabling memory decline.
Answers to this type of inquiry are fundamental for
understanding both how to prevent disease as well as
how to promote quality of life. While there is a rich
human literature on brain aging and cognition (e.g., [1]),
many insights about the details of brain aging have come
from the study of animal models, and the latter is the
focus of the current review.

Spatial memory and long-term potentiation
in aging
The gradual inability to recall the past or to retain new
information describes the erosion that occurs in those
who do become “demented” at older ages. In the end,
the rich set of recollections available from past events
defines each individual. Although many other changes
occur during the aging process, such as limitations in
range of motion, speed of gait, and acuity of vision and
hearing, none of these factors are as central to the core of
a person as are their collective experiences. Thus, the

quest to understand memory and how it is changed
during aging and in disease is a compelling problem.

As a graduate student in the 1970s, I remember listening
to neuroscience lectures about how scientists such as
Santiago Rámon y Cajal—often cited as the father of
modern neuroscience—were able to use relatively simple
microscopes to make fundamental discoveries. Rámon y
Cajal used Camillo Golgi’s silver chromate cell-staining
method to view single neurons in the brain, and
speculated that these neurons might communicate with
one another through specialized contact points. Charles
Sherrington would later call this critical point between
cells “the synapse”. In 1949 Donald Hebb articulated the
idea that the laying down of “memory traces” in the
brain would require a strengthening in the ability of one
cell to influence another. This increase in the strength of
synapses would then allow more reliable communica-
tion between one cell and another [2]. But how could
you test these ideas about memory traces in the brain
and whether
there was a breakdown in synaptic
communication during aging?

In 1973, Terje Lømo, Tim Bliss, and Tony Gardner-
Medwin devised a method that could experimentally
change synaptic strength—a process the brain may use to
lay down memory traces—that unlocked the door to the
mystery of memory [3,4]. Here, for the first time, was a
fully controllable, experimental proxy for learning. As
it turns out, the discovery of this method, known as
long-term potentiation (LTP), was a cornerstone in
the evolution of our understanding of the biology of
memory. Lømo et al. were electrophysiologists—they
applied small electrical currents to a group of cells, and
then measured the “collective” synaptic outputs. By
giving stimulation patterns to the brain that mimicked
normal electrical activity in neurons, a durable change in
synaptic strength could be directly measured. For me in
particular, LTP was the long-awaited tool that would
allow the biological process of learning and memory to
be studied. Importantly, it fulfilled a number of require-
ments proposed by Hebb for a process capable of laying
down and retrieving memories. This discovery made
it possible to study memory across the lifespan of an
animal, using animal models of aging.

The critical missing link in making progress towards
understanding what was “normal” in aging memory was
“what behavior to study.” Fortuitously, during the same
time that LTP was discovered, a draft copy of a review
article, which eventually morphed into the classic and
influential book, The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map [5]
by John O’Keefe and Lynn Nadel, was being passed
around among the professors of the department in which

I was a graduate student. It eventually found its way
to my desk, and in it was a description of how the
hippocampus likely had very similar functions in
memory in humans and other animals. In particular,
they outlined how spatial memory could be used across
species to better understand memory in all animals, as it
did not require language to be tested. John and Lynn’s
ideas encouraged my pursuit of questions that used
animal models of
the human condition, and that
combined behavioral studies with neurobiological
experiments that could interrogate how the brain
acquires, stores, and retrieves information.

Thus, with the discovery of LTP at hippocampal synapses,
and the idea that animal models of human memory could
be developed, I sought to finish my dissertation experi-
ments in a lab that was routinely conducting LTP
experiments. In 1973, when I began to look, there were
only three labs in the world that were doing these types of
experiments: Graham Goddard’s laboratory at Dalhousie
University, Tim Bliss’s in London, and Gary Lynch’s at
Irvine. As it turned out, my thesis advisor Peter Fried, at
Carleton University in Ottawa, had been one of God-
dard’s students, and he introduced me to Goddard by
saying, “I don’t really want you to steal my student, but
she has this idea that she thinks you might be interested
in.” I explained to Goddard that the experiment that
I wanted to conduct in his lab involved methods that only
his laboratory was currently using, namely surgically
implanting indwelling electrodes so that LTP could be
measured in awake,
freely behaving rats. Since the
hippocampus—the area of the brain where LTP was
first discovered—was also involved in spatial memory, I
wanted to use Goddard’s setup to track an animal’s ability
to make and keep spatial memories as it aged. Remark-
ably, after Fried’s phone call and introduction, and in an
act of faith and generosity, Goddard purchased animals
for me and began to “age” them in anticipation of my
arrival the following year, after I had finished the rest of
my course work and qualifying exams in Ottawa.

The behavioral tests used to study spatial memory at this
time all required either shock (a significant stress) or a
restricted eating or drinking schedule (also potentially
detrimental to the survival of the old rats) to motivate
animals. Because the precious aged animals could not
be replaced without waiting two years to grow another
“old” batch, we developed a novel, milder task that is
now often referred to as the Barnes maze. With rodents’
natural aversion to open, well-lit areas in mind, the
circular platform was designed with many openings
around its circumference, only one of which would
allow the animal to escape into a dark box beneath the
platform’s surface.

The rats were old enough to begin the behavior and
electrophysiological experiments in the latter part of
1975 (at an age equivalent to about 70–80 human
years). They were tested on the circular platform first
before being permanently implanted with electrodes that
could both stimulate hippocampal neurons and record
their activity (a technique similar to deep brain stimula-
tion for depression, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s in
humans), as well as allow the animals to walk unrest-
rained in a small holding cage while connected to the
amplifiers and computers necessary to obtain their
neurological responses. The electrodes implanted into
the hippocampus of the young and old rats in Goddard’s
laboratory allowed us to measure baseline synaptic
transmission with single stimuli, then to induce LTP
with patterned electrical currents that mimic the way in
which cells are normally active, and finally to monitor
the LTP (or elevated synaptic strength) and watch its
decay over several weeks. We found that LTP decayed
about twice as fast in the old rats as it did in the young,
with the “synaptic memory” lasting 20 days rather than
40. Most importantly, the durability of the synaptic
change (LTP) was correlated with the memory of the
correct hole on the circular platform task. In fact, the
correlation between LTP durability in the hippocampus
and spatial memory was the first demonstration that
rather than a mere proxy for learning, LTP might actually
represent at least one cellular mechanism by which
memories are created [6].

Just one year before I published my work on aging rats,
Bruce McNaughton [7] demonstrated that for synaptic
strengthening to occur, many synpases needed to
converge and be coactive on the target neuron. No
modification would result if only one or a few synapses
were active together (Graham Collingridge later found
that this cooperativity effect resulted from the properties
of a specific type of glutamate receptor—the newly
discovered, voltage-dependent N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid
[NMDA] receptor [8]). This fulfills Hebb’s requirement
for cooperativity among synapses carrying multiple bits
of information, reflecting the associations that must be
made to store an experience. These experimental results
had important theoretical implications that provided a
foundation on which to build the interpretation of our
aging findings from the experiments conducted in
Goddard’s laboratory [6]. In later experiments, others
also demonstrated that under some conditions, LTP can
be more difficult to induce in aged rats [9,10], and a
fascinating twist in the plasticity story is that mechanisms
that reduce synaptic strength and weaken connections,
known as long-term depression (LTD), are easier to
induce in the hippocampus of old rats [11]. This may
mean that LTD participates in ‘erasing’ LTP, potentially

increasing forgetting. Taken together, it is clear that even
in normal aging there are subtle changes in the biological
processes that underlie memory, and in the relationship
between how good an animal’s memory is and how
functional their synapses are. But the real message in
these experiments is that old animals can and do learn.
None of the older animals exhibited what could be
considered behaviorally to be “dementia”, nor were their
biological mechanisms that allow memory traces to be
laid down completely dysfunctional.

Aging networks
We know that plasticity mechanisms, LTP being one
example, are altered at older ages, but what was not
known was how this change in groups of cells that are
artificially stimulated translates into the function of cells
in behaviorally activated networks. While there is much
to be learned about the physiology of neural systems by
artificially stimulating them directly, even the mildest
currents do not exactly mimic the selective and sparse
activity of cells under normal behavioral states. To more
realistically understand the aging brain, it was necessary
to monitor cell circuits driven by natural behaviors.
Around the time that LTP was discovered, John O’Keefe
discovered “place cells” in the hippocampus—a major
breakthrough for the field. By simply placing small
microwires very close to hippocampal cells, without
stimulating them,
Jonathan

Dostrovski noted that
discharge action potentials only when a rat is in select
physical locations as it traverses a given environment
[12]. In fact, this observation provided a major rationale
for ideas outlined in the book, The Hippocampus as a
Cognitive Map [5], which detailed evidence for a link
between the hippocampus, memory, and space. The
unique property of
their
“receptive fields”, or the features that make each of
these cells fire, appeared to be related to specific regions
of space.

these place cells is that

John and his student

I went to O’Keefe’s lab in London in 1981 to learn how
to track the activity of these place cells in behaving young
and old rats, the motivation being to gain a broader
understanding of how changes in plasticity during aging
may impact the operation of these cellular networks. In
London that same year, Bruce McNaughton had the idea
for a much more powerful recording method (the tetrode
[13]), which could monitor and distinguish many cells at
once in behaving rats. He developed the method further
with Matt Wilson and they demonstrated that if enough
hippocampal cells were recorded simultaneously, it was
possible to reconstruct where the rat was in space, just by
using the activity of the recorded cells [14]. For example,
if cell A, B, and C had different, overlapping place fields

illustrating how the locations of

along a route, and the rat passed through that route in a
specific direction, cell A, B, and finally C would fire
sequentially,
the
elevated activity in specific hippocampal cells could
predict where the animal had been. This new method
provided an outstanding opportunity to examine the
effects of age on hippocampal network dynamics.

By recording from many individual cells at once, and
determining where each cell was active (where its place
field was), it is possible to visualize how the hippocam-
pus constructs a “cognitive map” of the surroundings.
The collective firing of cells in different places can be
thought of as a map or a representation of the context
onto which episodes of experience are linked. Using this
method, we were able to show that the hippocampal
map within a session of behavior (running around a track
for chocolate milk reward) was stable and reliable for
both young and old rats. That is, once the rat was placed
on the track, and began to run around it, each cell was
only active in its preferred spot. Additionally, if young
rats were given one track-running session in the morning,
and another one in the afternoon, the same hippocam-
pal map was retrieved in the afternoon as was present in
the morning, suggesting between-session map stability.
Here is where we made a critical observation about aging
hippocampal networks. For the old rats, a different place-
cell distribution would occasionally appear when the
rats went back for their second run of the day—it was as
if the older animals were retrieving the wrong hippo-
campal map [15]. This did not happen every day, but any
given old rat had about a 30% chance that this would
occur on any given day. Certainly if you are navigating
your memory space with the wrong map, you are going
to appear “lost”, or as though you have forgotten
your way. What could be the underlying cause of this
unstable map?

The possible answer to this question was provided by
Cliff Kentros, shortly after the aging observation was
made. Cliff pharmacologically blocked the NMDA
receptor in young animals, using a dose that also
blocked LTP. His findings were strikingly reminiscent
of the aging rats just described—within a given recording
session, the map was stable—but blocking LTP caused
map retrieval errors when a second session was given on
the same day [16]. This suggested that
faulty LTP
mechanisms may be responsible for this map instability
in aging.

Normative aging can be distinguished from
pathological aging in large scale neural circuits
Even though the new multiple tetrode recording method
was a large advance over the limitations of recording one

or two neurons at a time, as previous technologies
allowed, these methods are still constrained to samples
sizes of ~100–200 cells. With recent improvements in the
resolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) meth-
ods, and the discovery of genes whose expression can
dynamically monitor the activity of single neurons,
human, primate, and rat studies have begun to converge
on the identification of circuits most affected by the
normal aging process. Some of the new, genetic links to
memory have been particularly revealing. One of these is
the immediate early gene that Paul Worley has called Arc
(encoding the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated
protein) ([17], cf. [18]). This gene has at least two
features that are important with respect to understanding
normative aging processes. First, normal function of Arc
is necessary for durable LTP and lasting memories (both
of which are impaired in aging; e.g., [19]). I want to
emphasize another dimension, however, which is the
fact that Arc expression within individual cells is a
powerful and reliable indicator of cell activity—both
inside the hippocampus, and across many regions of the
brain. Using the property of Arc that allows readout of
behavior-driven cell activity, John Guzowski developed a
method that could monitor activity over hundreds of
thousands of cells across the brain (the ‘catFISH’
method) [20]. Using this single-cell imaging method,
an understanding is emerging of which cells, within
which memory circuits, are particularly affected by aging.
It is important to understand that the hippocampus is
not a unitary structure—there are three primary cell
groups within the hippocampus proper that combine to
make up the internal circuit. These include the CA1 and
CA3 pyramidal cells, and the granule cells of the den-
tate gyrus. Cells in the entorhinal cortex provide
the hippocampus with its primary input, and cells in
the subiculum serve as the primary output from the
hippocampus. We were able to show that in aging rats,
cell-specific gene expression (and therefore cell activity)
was identical across age in the cells of the CA1 and CA3
regions, but the Arc catFISH method revealed that the
number of granule cells engaged by these same behaviors
showed a continuous decline across age. In terms of
overall circuit function, these data point to the dentate
gyrus as being a weak link in the hippocampal circuit
during aging in the rat. Could this also be true in
primates?

Scott Small
joined in with my laboratory on an
experiment to answer this question in young and old
behaviorally characterized monkeys. Although MRI
methods do not have single-cell resolution, they can
provide an indirect gauge of activity over large segments
of the brain. Using a variation of standard MRI methods
(cerebral blood volume), it is possible to monitor the

F1000 Biology Reports 2011, 3:22

function of the brain in a resting state, and to look at
activity in different components of the hippocampus as
well as in its input and output structures. We applied
these cerebral blood volume imaging methods to a
colony of monkeys ranging in age from 9 to 27 years old
(equivalent to 27–87 human years). There were no
differences in resting metabolic measures in CA1,
subiculum, or entorhinal cortex over this age range. But
the old monkeys did show reduced activity selective to
the dentate gyrus—reminiscent of
the Arc imaging
findings in our aging rats [21]. Critically, there was a
significant correlation between the brain activity mea-
sure in the region of the dentate gyrus and memory in the
aging monkeys—the lower the activity, the poorer the
memory. Scott had observed something similar in an
earlier human aging study [22]. With human studies,
however, there is always some concern that some of the
people tested, while seemingly normal at the time, may
be showing the beginnings of neurological symptoms.
Because only humans contract Alzheimer’s disease, not
other animals, the monkey and rat experiments were
critical for the overall interpretation of the human data.
By examining aging in animals who do not sponta-
neously get this disease, a very strong case can be built
that the dentate gyrus is a major player in the changes
that occur in normal aging in mammals.

The findings just reviewed led to an important insight,
when combined with what
is known about which
temporal lobe regions are affected in diseases such as
Alzheimer’s. In the case of Alzheimer’s disease, the cells
in CA1 and in the entorhinal cortex are dramatically
affected early in the course of the disease; however, in the
same individuals, the granule cells of the dentate gyrus
do not show changes (with respect to age-matched
controls) until very late in the illness. While aging and
Alzheimer’s disease may in some cases be “super-
imposed”, there is not a simple linear trajectory where
we all end up with the disease. Rather, aging has a
different neural signature, supporting the contention
that aging and Alzheimer’s disease are distinct [23,24].

Understanding genetic and epigenetic processes
that guide successful aging trajectories
Presently, the “omic” revolution may be leading us as
close as we have ever been to understanding why one of a
pair of identical human twins can maintain a high level
of cognition during aging, while the other does not.
Technological advances in understanding the details of
individual genomes are progressing at an almost breath-
taking speed. One example with respect to memory is a
study that used a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
genome-wide association approach in young adults to
identify SNPs that were most strongly related to memory

performance. The SNP identified was a simple nucleotide
base switch between the normal cytosine–thymine bond
at a specific location in the KIBRA gene. The people
surveyed who had the thymine–thymine SNP had the
best memory [25]. This was further confirmed in an
independent elderly population, supporting the view
that this particular SNP in the KIBRA gene predisposed
people of any age to have “better memory” [26]. This
could be another clue to help guide our understanding of
the molecular cascades that support good memory; plus,
the activity of the KIBRA gene does influence pathways
involved in synaptic strengthening previously men-
tioned. Could there be a link between the KIBRA gene
and age-related memory decline? One way to test this
hypothesis was to find a way to manipulate part of the
molecular circuit in which the KIBRA gene is known to be
involved. These are the kinds of experiments that rarely
work, but Matt Huentelman persevered and found a
promising compound that was already approved for use
in treatment of angina. Quite remarkably, and as
predicted, hydroxyfasudil

improved spatial

In addition to methods that can accurately identify
variations in DNA in individuals, we now know that
epigenetic factors are engaged not only during early
development (as these mechanisms were classically
described), but also in adulthood. Another paradigm-
shifting observation in very recent years has been that
chromatin can be remodeled in the hippocampus in
response to learning [28]. The thought that your DNA is
continually being modified is somewhat disconcerting.
While the experimental progress in this area is picking up
speed, it took a long time for the scientific community to
be comfortable with this idea. But the data are the data; in
fact, it appears that some of the age-related changes in
memory are likely to be due to alterations in the epigenetic
modification of chromatin—via both acetylation [29] and
methylation [30] mechanisms. For example, as Marsha
Penner was finishing her PhD thesis in my lab on
behavior-induced Arc expression in young and old rats
she had an interesting insight: maybe the changes
observed in Arc mRNA expression, such as fewer
hippocampal granule cells expressing Arc in response to
behavior, were partly due to altered RNA transcription
processes in aging. One way transcription can be reduced,
of course, is through altered DNA methylation processes.

David Sweatt recently showed changes in DNA methyla-
tion state in response to learning, and he was very
interested in collaborating with us to determine whether
changes in this process during aging might explain our
Arc data. More methylation of DNA typically means that
there is less RNA transcribed. Following behavior, the

F1000 Biology Reports 2011, 3:22

http://f1000.com/reports/b/3/22

methylation state of the Arc gene was, in fact, reduced in
both age groups (a condition that allows more of the Arc
mRNA to be transcribed). The factor that differed
between young and old animals was that in the resting
old brain, granule cells, for example, had overall higher
methylation levels, meaning that it was less likely that
Arc could be transcribed from the DNA. There are many
complex facets of these data, but these kinds of results
have led us and others to hypothesize that there may well
be a number of changes that accumulate during aging
via epigenetic means, and that dysregulation of these
processes may contribute in a fundamental way to
normal age-related cognitive change. While the details of
exactly how aging affects histone posttranslational
modifications and alterations in DNA methylation
remain to be elucidated, it is at least safe to guess that
these mechanisms will be critical to understand for
future experimental designs aimed at optimizing cogni-
tion across the lifespan. These processes are also
amenable to pharmacological manipulation.

Conclusions
Looking back on the rather grim predictions concerning
memory and the elderly that were held only several
decades ago, the vision today is very different and much
more positive. There are many who live to very old ages
with minimal cognitive decline—and certainly no
dementia. One particularly interesting study in this
regard was done in Sweden with individuals who were
100 years of age (centenarians) at the beginning of the
study, who were followed longitudinally until the time
of their death to monitor cognitive function and other
factors in the “oldest old” [31]. Interestingly, 73% of
these centenarians were dementia free at the end of their
lives (the oldest reaching an age of 111 years). Watching
the remarkable discoveries in biology over the past half
century, one cannot help but look with excitement
towards the next groundbreaking findings that are surely
in the making. The future holds great promise for the
once remote dream of being able to understand the core
biological processes required for optimal cognitive
health during aging—our progress in this regard should
also provide the needed backdrop for understanding and
preventing the complex neurological diseases that can be
superimposed on the aging brain.
