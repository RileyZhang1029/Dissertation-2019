Abstract: There is a growing appreciation of the potential value for routine screening for the presence of HPV not only 
for cervical specimens but also from oral cavity. The purpose of this study was to develop and clinically evaluate a single-
tube seminested PCR assay for the detection of HPV. Several parameters such as PCR primers, primer annealing tempera-
ture, the number of PCR cycles and concentration of PCR components were optimized. The assay was evaluated using 
HPV inserts of type 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 38 and 51. Evaluation of seminested PCR assay was performed with cervical 
scrapings from 30 patients and buccal swabs from 30 head and neck cancer patients and results were compared with those 
of two-tube nested PCR. The results were found to be comparable with a total of 60% (36/60) of samples being positive 
for HPV using the single-tube assay, while 62% (37/60) positivity was found with two-tube PCR assay. We succeeded in 
developing a single-tube seminested PCR method for HPV DNA detection which is easier than the conventional nested 
PCR and can be further evaluated as a potential screening tool for detecting HPV in oral and cervical regions. 

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Infection  with  high-risk  (oncogenic)  types  of  human  
papillomavirus (HPV) is a well-established risk factor for the 
development of cervical carcinoma [1]. Association between 
HPV and the development of certain head and neck cancers 
has  also  been  established  recently  [2].  This  is  strengthened 
by the fact that the oncogenic HPV types detected in cervical 
carcinomas  have  also  been  identified  in  head  and  neck  
cancers [3]. 
  The  use  of  nested  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  
employing  degenerate  consensus  primers  has  been  shown  
by  various  authors  to  be  an  extremely  sensitive  method  for 
detecting a wide range of known and novel HPV types [4, 5]. 
Previous  studies,  including  our  own  work,  have  found 
MY/GP  two-step  nested  PCR  to  be  far  more  sensitive  than 
the USFDA approved Hybrid Capture II assay (Digene), for 
detecting HPV [6-8].  
  A  two-step  or  two-tube  nested  PCR  is  time-consuming, 
requires  two  sets  of  reaction  mixtures  and  is  prone  to  
false  positive  reactions,  as  transfer  from  first  to  second

amplification reaction can result in cross-contamination [9]. 
On the other hand, single-tube/step nested PCR requires only 
a  single  preparation  of  reaction  mixture  thus  reducing  the  
risk  of  contamination  and  overall  reaction  time.  However, 
single-tube nested PCR incorporating two primer pairs could 
lead  to  cross-reactivity  among  the  outer  and  inner  set  of 
primers  leading  to  non-specific  bands.  Instead  of  conven-
tional  four  primers  in  nested  PCR  assay,  some  researchers 
use only three primers [10, 11], whereby one outer primer is 
shared  with  two  inner  primers,  and  categorize  it  as  semi-
nested PCR. Seminested PCRs often help in reducing unde-
sired products, while at the same time dramatically increas-
ing sensitivity. Use of three or more primers in a single tube 
to  perform  seminested  PCR,  by  changing  concentration  of 
DNA and annealing temperatures for detection of virus and 
bacteria had been reported,  although these studies were not 
designed  for  HPV  detection.  Previous  seminested  PCRs  
developed  for  HPV  detection  were  performed  as  two-tube 
seminested  [10-12].  This  study  aimed  to  develop  a  single-
tube seminested PCR method for HPV DNA detection.  

2. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY 

2.1.  Selection  of  Primers  for  Single-Tube  Seminested 
PCR 
 
Primers  specific  for  L1  region  of  the  HPV  genome 
namely MY09, MY11 and GP6+ (Fig.  1) were employed in 
this  study [13, 14]. A mixture of plasmids with HPV DNA

inserts  of  type  6,11,16,18,31,33,38  and  51  were  utilized  as 
templates in the PCR.  

2.2. Optimization of Single-Tube Seminested PCR 
  Optimization of the PCR was done on several parameters 
such  as  annealing  temperatures  of  MY09/11  and  MY11/ 
GP6+  primer  pairs,  concentration  of  MY09,11  and  GP6+ 
primers,  MgCl2,  Taq  polymerase  and  number  of  cycles  for 
first and second round PCR, to obtain best results with HPV 
plasmid DNA. 

2.3. HPV Detection by Single-Tube Seminested PCR  
 
For  this  assay  optimized  amounts  of  reagents  (primers 
MY09,  MY11,  GP6+;  MgCl2;  Taq  polymerase),  dNTPs, 
buffer and sample DNA were made up to 20 (cid:1)l total reaction 
volume.  PCR  was  performed  at  optimized  annealing 
temperatures  and  number  of  cycles  on  HPV  plasmid  mix. 
Sensitivity of the assay was also determined.  

2.4. HPV Detection by Two-Tube Nested PCR 
  Two-tube  PCR  was  performed  on  HPV  plasmids  as 
above using conditions as per the published literature [7, 15].  

2.5. Clinical Samples  
 
Informed  consent  was  obtained  from  the  participants  
before  proceeding  for  sample  collection.  The  study  was 
approved  by  Human  Research  and  Ethics  Committee,  
Universiti Sains Malaysia (FWA Reg. No: 007718). 
2.5.1. Cervical Samples 
  Cervical  scrapings  from  30  patients  were  obtained  from 
Obstetrics  and  Gynecology  clinics  of  Hospital  Universiti 
Sains  Malaysia  (Table  1).  Two  swabs  were  obtained  using 

cytobrush.  One  of  the  swabs  was  used  in  the  preparation  
of  Pap  smear  for  evaluation  by  pathologists  based  on  Be-
thesda  reporting  system,  2001  [16]  while  the  other  was 
stored in -20oC freezer for further analysis.  
2.5.2. Oral Samples  
  Buccal  swabs  from  30  head  and  neck  cancer  patients 
were collected using sterile EUROTUBO® collection swabs 
(Table 2). The swab was held against the buccal mucosa and 
rubbed  for  10  seconds  at  each  side  and  stored  in  -20oC 
freezer until further analysis. 

2.6.  DNA  Extraction  and  HPV  Detection  in  Clinical 
Samples 
  DNA  was  extracted  from  samples  with  the  QIAamp® 
DNA  Extraction  Mini  Kit  (Qiagen,  Germany)  according  to 
the  manufacturer’s  protocol.  To  check  the  quality  of  DNA 
samples,  a  268-base-pair  sequence  of  (cid:2)-globin  gene  was  
amplified as  an internal control. PCR was performed on all 
clinical  samples  with  optimized  single-tube  seminested  and 
two-tube nested PCR to evaluate its clinical performance.  

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

3.1.  Establishment  and  Optimization  of  Single-Tube 
Seminested PCR 
  To begin with, MY11/GP6+ PCR was performed in 20 (cid:1)l 
total reaction volume with 100pg of plasmid DNA template 
using conditions described in previously published literature 
for  MY  09/11  and  GP5+/6+  systems  [17].  A  single  190bp 
band was visualized as PCR product. 
  To obtain this 190bp amplicon in single-tube seminested 
PCR,  optimization  with  primers  MY09,  MY11  and  GP6+

was done. To allow for the difference in annealing tempera- 
tures,  the  melting  temperatures  (Tms)  of  outer  and  inner 
primer  pairs  were  established  more  than  10oC  apart.  The 
highest  amplification  was  observed  at  53.0oC  &  40.0oC  for 
MY09/11  and  MY11/GP6+  primer  pairs  respectively.  The 
substantially higher first round annealing temperature (53oC) 
prevented  the  second  round  primers  annealing  to  the 
template DNA until  the  temperature was reduced  to 40.0oC 
at the start of the second round of amplification.  

  The optimization for the primer concentration was done 
by  varying  the  concentration  of  one  primer,  keeping  the 
other two primer concentrations fixed. As the concentration 
of MY09 was decreased, the 450bp band became less visible 
and  was  replaced  by  a  190  bp  band  at  1  pmole  of  MY09 
primer (Fig. 2). A concentration of 2.5 pmole for other outer 
primer MY09 was sufficient for optimum product formation 
in both amplification rounds of seminested PCR. Concentra-
tion  of  MY09  lower  than  2.5  pmole  resulted  in  only  one

band of 190 bp signifying that its concentration was too low 
to give any product to be used as a template for MY11/GP6+ 
primers.  A  concentration  higher  than  2.5  pmole  for  MY09 
also gave only one band which was of 450 bp, indicating that 
no MY11/GP6+ product formation occurred. 
  Different  combinations  of  number  of  cycles  were  used, 
i.e. 5 and 30, 10 and 30, 20 and 30, 20 and 20, 30 and 30, for 
first  and  second  round  PCR  respectively,  to  determine  the 
optimum number of cycles. An increase in the first round of 

PCR  cycles  resulted  in  a  strong  MY09/11  band  (450  bp) 
while an increase in second round cycles resulted in a strong 
MY11/GP6+  band  (190  bp).  In  order  to  achieve  clearly  
detectable amplification of the 190 bp product in the shortest 
overall  time  without  any  nonspecific  bands,  PCR  with  10 
cycles in the first round followed by 30 cycles for the second 
round was found to provide the best results. 
  As a result of optimizing PCR parameters, conditions for 
amplification  were  as  follows:  1.5  mM  MgCl2,  200  mM

dNTP  mixture,  10  pmol  of  MY11  and  GP6+  primers,  2.5 
pmol of MY09 primer, and 1 U of hot start Taq polymerase 
(Fermentas)  per  20  (cid:1)l  of  the  reaction  mixture.  Initial 
denaturation  occurred  at  95oC  for  3  min,  followed  by  10 
cycles  of  95oC  for  30  s,  53oC  for  30  s,  and  72oC  for  30  s. 
This  was  followed  by  another  30  cycles  of  95oC  for  30  s, 
40oC for 30 s, and 72oC for 30 s. A final extension was done 
at 72oC for 7 min.  

3.2.  Evaluation  of  Single-Tube  and  Two-Tube  PCR  on 
HPV Plasmids  
  The optimized single-tube seminested PCR performed on 
plasmids with different HPV genotype inserts produced am-
plicons of either 190 bp or 450 bp or both (Fig 3A). Results 
for two-tube nested PCR are shown in Fig  3B. The identity 
of the bands was further confirmed to be that of the HPV-L1 
region by sequencing (data not shown). The results of single-
tube  seminested  were  comparable  with  that  of  two-tube 
nested using plasmids with HPV genotype inserts.  
 
Figs.  (4A  and  4B)  show  the  sensitivity  of  single-tube 
seminested  PCR  and  two-tube  nested  PCR.  The  detection 
limit for seminested PCR was also found to have a compara-
ble  sensitivity  up  to  a  concentration  of  1  fg of  HPV  DNA. 

Saini et al. 
Two-tube  nested  PCR  gave  brightest  band  at  10  pg,  which 
suggests that excessive DNA  template  available  at the start 
of  second  round  of  GP  nested  PCR  might  inhibit  the  PCR 
reaction resulting in false negative results. Furthermore, two-
tube nested PCR gave amplicons at 140, 190 and 450 bp due 
to  cross-reaction  between  different  primers.  No  such  cross-
reactivity was seen with single-tube seminested PCR.  

3.3.  Evaluation  of  Single-Tube  and  Two-Tube  PCR  on 
Clinical Samples  
  The  results  of  HPV  DNA  detection  in  the  cervical 
scrapings  and  buccal  swabs  by  single-tube  seminested  
and two-tube nested PCR are shown in Table 1 and Table  2 
respectively. The results of our assay were comparable with 
that  of  two-tube  nested  PCR.  Nineteen  cervical  swabs 
(63.3%)  and  17  buccal  swabs  (56.7%)  were  found  to  be  
positive  for  HPV  by  single-tube  PCR.  With  two-tube,  18 
cervical samples (60%) and 19 buccal samples (63.3%) were 
positive for HPV. Analysis of the quality of DNA of the two 
buccal  swabs  positive  by  two-tube  but  negative  by  single-
tube assay revealed low concentration of DNA as compared 
to  other  samples.  The  higher  positivity  in  two-tube  could 
also have been due to false positivity by cross contamination 
during nested step. In the cervical samples, the concentration

of one discordant sample was relatively high as compared to 
other  samples  which  may  have  resulted  in  a  false  negative 
result  seen  in  the  two-tube  assay  as  explained  above.  This 
was  a  preliminary  clinical  evaluation  of  the  assay  we  devel-
oped using a relatively small number of samples. We intend 
to  carry  out  further  assessment  on  more  samples  to  better 
evaluate the single-tube seminested assay.  

 
In this study, we have described an improved nested am-
plification  system  for  HPV  in  which  the  reagents  of  both 
PCR  rounds  were  included  in  a  single  tube  to  eliminate  the 
risk  of  contamination  in  two-tube  PCR  at  the  nesting  step. 
Further,  as designing a system with short final amplification 
products  greatly  increases  its  amplification  efficiency  [18]; 
single-tube  seminested  gave  the  final  amplification  product 
of 190 bp which was less than half the size of MY09-MY11 
product.   

4. CONCLUSION 

Single-tube 

 
seminested  PCR  was  developed  and 
evaluated  for  the  detection  of  HPV  DNA  in  plasmids  with 
HPV  inserts  and  clinical  samples.  Preliminary  results  
show  that  our  assay  appears  to  be  well  suited  for  detecting 
HPV in cervical as well as buccal swabs. Further evaluation 
using  larger  number  of  samples  is  in  progress.  As  this 
method  is  rapid,  highly  sensitive  and  has  minimum  cross 
contamination,  it  has  a  potential  in  screening  high-risk  
patients and epidemiological studies.
