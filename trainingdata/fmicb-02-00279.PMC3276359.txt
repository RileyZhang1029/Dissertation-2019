Measles is a highly contagious disease that causes temporary and severe immunosup-
pression in patients. Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) expressed on cells
of the immune system functions as a receptor for measles virus (MV). In addition to SLAM,
vaccine strains of MV also use a ubiquitously expressed complement regulatory protein,
CD46, as a receptor, whereas wild-type (wt) MV strains do not use this receptor. How-
ever, recent studies have indicated that SLAM is not the sole receptor for wt MV strains.
These strains have an intrinsic ability to enter both immune and epithelial cells using dis-
tinct receptor binding sites in their hemagglutinin (H) protein. Recently, a clear answer
was obtained through the identiﬁcation of an epithelial MV receptor, nectin4, expressed
at adherens junctions, thereby greatly improving our knowledge of MV receptors. It is
now clear that MV speciﬁcally targets two cell types, immune cells and epithelial cells,
using SLAM and nectin4, respectively. MV loses the ability to use either SLAM or nectin4
when it possesses speciﬁc mutations in the H protein. However, nectin4-blind MV still
infects SLAM-positive immune cells efﬁciently (SLAM-tropic), and conversely, SLAM-blind
MV infects nectin4-positive epithelial cells efﬁciently (nectin4-tropic). In this regard, MV
is intrinsically dual-tropic to immune cells and epithelial cells. Although many aspects and
molecular mechanisms underlying immunosuppressive effects and a highly contagious
nature of MV still remain to be elucidated, analyses of physiological functions of these two
receptors would provide deep insights into MV pathogenesis.

MEASLES VIRUS
Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease characterized
by high fever, malaise, coryza, conjunctivitis, cough, and a mac-
ulopapular rash (Grifﬁn, 2007). Patients with measles develop a
severe and temporary immunosuppression, which is often accom-
panied by secondary bacterial infections (Grifﬁn, 2007). Despite
the availability of highly effective vaccines, measles-related deaths
were estimated to be 164,000 worldwide in 2008 (WHO, 2009).
The causative agent is measles virus (MV), which belongs to the
genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. The virus par-
ticle is enveloped and contains a non-segmented negative-strand
RNA genome encoding six tandem linked genes, N, P/V/C, M,
F, H, and L. The genome is encapsidated by the nucleocapsid
(N) protein and associated with viral RNA-dependent RNA poly-
merases, forming a helical ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). On
the envelope, the viral particle possesses two types of viral gly-
coprotein spikes, the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins
(Grifﬁn, 2007). The H protein is responsible for binding to cellu-
lar receptors on the target host cells, and plays a key role in the
determination of host cell speciﬁcity (tropism) of MV (Yanagi
et al., 2009). Binding of the H protein to a receptor triggers
F protein-mediated membrane fusion between the virus enve-
lope and the host cell plasma membrane, releasing the RNP into
the cytoplasm. In cells infected with MV, the H and F proteins
are expressed on the cell surface and cause cell-to-cell fusion,
producing syncytia.

DISCOVERIES OF CELLULAR RECEPTORS FOR MV
Basically, MV speciﬁcally infects cells expressing its receptors.
Therefore, the distribution pattern of its receptors is a key deter-
minant of which cells become infected with MV (Yanagi et al.,
2009). The initial discovery of an MV receptor came in 1993
(Dorig et al., 1993; Naniche et al., 1993). Two independent stud-
ies indicated that the receptor molecule for MV is the human
membrane cofactor protein (MCP/CD46), a central component
of the complement system, which is expressed ubiquitously on
all organs and tissues throughout the human body (Dorig et al.,
1993; Naniche et al., 1993). These ﬁndings were highly wel-
comed from the viewpoint that MV causes a systemic infection.
Meanwhile, Kobune et al. (1990) reported the isolation of lym-
photropic MV strains, and subsequent studies indicated that these
lymphotropic MV strains do not use MCP/CD46 as a recep-
tor (Yanagi et al., 2009). Importantly, Kobune’s isolates exhibited
a high virulence in experimentally infected monkeys, whereas
MCP/CD46-using classical MV isolates caused no or mild dis-
ease in monkeys (Kobune et al., 1990, 1996; Takeda et al., 1998).
Hence, new two questions have arisen for MV researchers. What
is the receptor for these lymphotropic strains? Which strains are
the real wild-type (wt) MV strains? In 2000, using Kobune’s iso-
lates, another receptor was identiﬁed (Tatsuo et al., 2000). This
receptor is signaling lymphocyte activation molecule, also known
as CD150 (SLAM/CD150), which is expressed on cells of the
immune system (Tatsuo et al., 2000). Subsequent studies clariﬁed

that SLAM/CD150 is a receptor for wt MV strains circulating in
patients, and that MCP/CD46 does not act as a receptor for wt
MV strains (Yanagi et al., 2009). MCP/CD46 acts as a receptor
only for vaccine and some laboratory MV strains (Yanagi et al.,
2009). Currently, it is clear that these MV strains have acquired
the ability to use MCP/CD46 as an alternative receptor to grow
in laboratory cell lines lacking SLAM/CD150 expression (Yanagi
et al., 2009).

Hence, it has become generally accepted that wt MV is a lym-
photropic virus that speciﬁcally targets immune cells, similar to
the case of human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) and human
T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV1). In 2000, a recombi-
nant MV, IC323, was generated based on Kobune’s ﬁrst isolate
(Takeda et al., 2000), and has greatly contributed to our under-
standing of the molecular bases for the pathogenesis of wt MV
strains (Takeuchi et al., 2005; de Swart et al., 2007; Devaux et al.,
2008, 2011; Leonard et al., 2008; Nakatsu et al., 2008; de Vries
et al., 2010; Ludlow et al., 2010; Mühlebach et al., 2011; Noyce
et al., 2011). At that time, only SLAM/CD150-positive cells were
found to be susceptible to wt MV infections. However, it remained
difﬁcult to make a ﬁnal conclusion that SLAM/CD150 is the sole
receptor for wt MV, because histopathological examinations of
measles patients and monkeys infected with MV have revealed
considerable levels of MV protein expression in the epithelia of
various organs, and histopathological changes are also evident
in these epithelia (Nii et al., 1964; Lightwood and Nolan, 1970;
Olding-Stenkvist and Bjorvatn, 1976; Moench et al., 1988; Craig-
head, 2000; Figure 1). In 2003, primary cultures of human small
airway epithelial cells (SAECs) were shown to be susceptible to wt
MV infection (Takeuchi et al., 2003). Upon MV infection, large
syncytia developed in SAECs via a SLAM-independent mech-
anism (Takeuchi et al., 2003). After searching many cell lines,
several epithelial cell lines with high susceptibility to MV infec-
tion were identiﬁed (Takeda et al., 2007; Tahara et al., 2008).
Tahara et al. (2008) and Leonard et al. (2008) clearly demonstrated
that wt MV infects epithelial cell lines that form tight junctions
(TJs) using an unidentiﬁed receptor (Leonard et al., 2008; Tahara
et al., 2008). Using these cells and recombinant IC323 express-
ing green ﬂuorescent protein (IC323-EGFP; Takeda et al., 2000;
Hashimoto et al., 2002), a ﬁnal answer was obtained for the recep-
tor on epithelial cells. Two groups independently demonstrated
that nectin4, which is expressed at adherens junctions (AJs), acts
as a receptor for MV (Mühlebach et al., 2011; Noyce et al., 2011).
Interestingly, MV loses the ability to use either SLAM/CD150 or
nectin4 when it possesses speciﬁc mutations in the H protein
(Leonard et al., 2008; Tahara et al., 2008; Figure 2). Nectin4-blind
MV still infects SLAM/CD150-positive immune cells efﬁciently
(SLAM/CD150-tropic), and conversely, SLAM/CD150-blind MV
infects nectin4-positive epithelial cells efﬁciently (nectin4-tropic;
Leonard et al., 2008; Tahara et al., 2008; Figure 2). In this regard,
MV is intrinsically dual-tropic to immune cells and epithelial cells
(Figure 2).

There is now no doubt that SLAM/CD150 and nectin4 are the
major receptors for MV. However, other molecules may further
support MV infection in vivo, being involved in the development
of measles and its neurological sequela. For example, the mech-
anism that the C-type lectin DC-speciﬁc intercellular adhesion

molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) acts as an attach-
ment receptor for MV, thereby promoting MV infection of DCs,
may be ideal to understand the extraordinarily high transmissibil-
ity of measles (de Witte et al., 2006, 2008). It is well known that
MV causes subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a persis-
tent infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with MV. This
occurs with a mean latency period of 7–10 years after suffering
from acute measles at a frequency of 1/5,000–1/100,000 reported
cases of acute measles (Takasu et al., 2003; Bellini et al., 2005). The
mechanisms underlying the spread of MV in the CNS remain to
be elucidated. Although nectin4 is a possible candidate for an MV
receptor in the CNS, no (or undetectable) nectin4 expression was
observed in the CNS in humans (Reymond et al., 2001; Brancati
et al., 2010), and some MV strains derived from SSPE patients are
likely to use nectin4 inefﬁciently (Seki et al., 2011). Data reported
by Makhortova et al. (2007) suggest that neurokinin-1, a substance
P receptor, supports trans-synaptic transmission of MV by acting
as a receptor for the F protein.

SLAM/CD150
Measles virus infection causes immunosuppression in patients and
is often accompanied by secondary bacterial infections. Typically,
MV-induced immunosuppression is characterized by a marked
lymphopenia, and an early TH1 response followed by predomi-
nant and prolonged TH2 response in patients, with suppression
of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation ex vivo (Grifﬁn and

Measles virus is dual-tropic

Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated pro-
tein (SAP)-family adaptors [SAP, Ewing’s sarcoma-associated
transcript (EAT)-2, and EAT-2-related transducer (ERT)] play
important roles for the signal transductions mediated by the
SLAM-family receptors (Veillette, 2010; Ma and Deenick, 2011).
They are small proteins that consist of a single Src homology 2
(SH2) domain and a short carboxy-terminal region. SAP asso-
ciates intracellularly with the ITSMs in the cytoplasmic region of
the SLAM-family receptors via the SH2 domain (Dong and Veil-
lette, 2010; Veillette, 2010; Ma and Deenick, 2011). SAP has the
ability to bind concomitantly to the Src-family protein tyrosine
kinase, Fyn, thereby coupling the SLAM-family receptors with
Fyn (Dong and Veillette, 2010; Veillette, 2010; Cannons et al.,
2011). Thereafter, Fyn phosphorylates tyrosine residues at the
cytoplasmic region of SLAM-family receptors and other intracel-
lular effector molecules, activating the downstream signals (Detre
et al., 2010; Dong and Veillette, 2010; Cannons et al., 2011; Ma
and Deenick, 2011). In another mechanism, SAP binding to the
SH2 domain of SLAM-family receptors competes with the bind-
ing of other SH2 domain-containing molecules, thus modulating
the SLAM-mediated signaling (Dong and Veillette, 2010; Veil-
+
lette, 2010; Cannons et al., 2011). In CD4
T cells, signals via
SLAM/CD150-SAP–Fyn interactions play important roles in reg-
ulating T cell receptor-mediated induction of TH2 cytokines, such
as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 (Detre et al., 2010; Cannons et al.,
2011; Ma and Deenick, 2011). EAT-2 also mediates the signal trans-
duction cascades of the SLAM-family receptors via a similar but
distinct mechanism to that of SAP (Cannons et al., 2011). Simi-
lar to SAP, EAT-2 also associates with the ITSMs of SLAM-family
receptors through its SH2 domain, but mediates the subsequent
signal cascades via its own phosphorylated tyrosine in the short
carboxy-terminal region (Veillette, 2010). In general, the signals
mediated by the SAP-family adaptors induce the activation and
differentiation of immune cells (Veillette, 2010). However, if the
SAP-family adaptors are absent, the SLAM-family receptors medi-
ate inhibitory signals to immune cells (a switch-of-function effect;
Dong and Veillette, 2010; Veillette, 2010).

Roles for SLAM/CD150 in macrophage functions, cell adhe-
sion, and NKT cell development have also been demonstrated,
although many data were obtained in mice (Dong and Veillette,
2010; Veillette, 2010; Cannons et al., 2011; Ma and Deenick, 2011).
X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is a rare immunodeﬁ-
ciency disease typically caused by mutations in the SAP-encoding
gene, SH2D1A (Veillette, 2010; Ma and Deenick, 2011). Patients
with this syndrome have various functional defects and impaired
differentiation of immune cells, indicating crucial roles for SAP
in normal immunity (Dong and Veillette, 2010). Hypogamma-
globulinemia, massive lymphoproliferative syndrome, and a fatal
response to Epstein–Barr virus infection are characteristics of the
disease (Veillette, 2010; Ma and Deenick, 2011). Although SLAM-
family receptors have some functional redundancy, each receptor
plays speciﬁc roles in a variety of immune responses (Dong and
Veillette, 2010; Veillette, 2010).

NECTIN4
In general, lymphotropic viruses, such as HIV and HTLV1, can
never be airborne, and are transmitted inefﬁciently even through

FIGURE 2 | Dual-tropic nature of wt MV. Wt MV (IC323) infects and
produces syncytia in both SLAM-positive lymphoblastoid B95a and
nectin4-positive epithelial II-18 cells (dual-tropic). IC323 with an R533A
mutation in the H protein fails to spread in B95a cells (SLAM-blind), but
replicates well in II-18 cells (nectin4-tropic). On the contrary, IC323 with a
Y543S mutation in the H protein spreads in B95a cells (SLAM-tropic), but
fails to spread in II-18 cells (nectin4-blind). All MVs in this ﬁgure are
engineered to express EGFP.

Ward, 1993; Schneider-Schaulies and Schneider-Schaulies, 2009).
Some, if not all, of these immunological observations must be
attributed either directly or indirectly to the fact that MV uses
SLAM/CD150 as a receptor. SLAM/CD150 is a member of the
SLAM-family receptors, which belong to the immunoglobulin
(Ig) superfamily (Veillette, 2010; Ma and Deenick, 2011). The
SLAM-family consists of nine members (Cannons et al., 2011;
Ma and Deenick, 2011). The SLAM-family receptors are type
I transmembrane proteins that typically possess an extracellu-
lar region with two Ig-like domains (an amino-terminal variable
(V)-like domain and a carboxy-terminal constant-2 (C2)-like
domain), a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region that
harbors multiple tyrosine-based motifs (Detre et al., 2010; Veil-
lette, 2010; Cannons et al., 2011; Ma and Deenick, 2011). These
motifs are referred to as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch
motifs (ITSMs; Cannons et al., 2011). The SLAM-family recep-
tors are expressed in a broad range of immune cells and play
critical roles in immunity. In general, the receptors act as self-
ligands and their homophilic trans-interactions occur between
either heterotypic or homotypic immune cells (Veillette, 2010; Ma
and Deenick, 2011). SLAM/CD150 is expressed on thymocytes,
subsets of B and T lymphocytes, mature dendritic cells (DCs),
macrophages, and platelets, and their expression is upregulated or
induced in lymphocytes and monocytes upon activation (Detre
et al., 2010; Veillette, 2010; Cannons et al., 2011; Ma and Deenick,
2011).

direct contact with patients. In sharp contrast, MV transmits via
aerosols, and has a highly contagious nature. Therefore, this trans-
mission style of MV cannot be easily explained by the fact that the
virus uses a lymphocytic molecule, SLAM/CD150, as a receptor.
The recent ﬁndings showing that MV uses nectin4, a cell adhe-
sion molecule (CAM) expressed at the AJs of epithelia, may partly
but nicely explain how and why MV transmits efﬁciently from
a patient to other individuals. Epithelial cells are connected with
one another through the formation of several specialized cell–cell
junctions, such as TJs, AJs, desmosomes, and gap junctions. TJs
function as a physical barrier that prevents the passage of solu-
ble molecules through the intercellular gaps, and also blocks the
lateral movement of lipids and membrane proteins across the TJ
barrier, thereby acting as the border of the apical and basolateral
membranes. AJs are located near the basolateral side of the TJs.
They are basically formed by cadherins and nectins and intracel-
lularly connected by actin ﬁlaments. Nectin4 is a member of the
nectin family, which consists of four members (nectin1, 2, 3, and
4; Takai et al., 2008a). Nectin1 and nectin2 were originally iden-
tiﬁed as poliovirus receptor-related protein (PRR)-1 and PRR-2,
respectively, and subsequently shown to support the entry of some
herpes viruses (Takai et al., 2008a,b). Similar to the SLAM-family
members, nectins are also type I transmembrane proteins that
belong to the Ig superfamily (Takai et al., 2008a,b). In general,
they possess an extracellular region with three Ig-like domains (an
amino-terminal V-like domain and two C-like domains), a trans-
membrane region, and a cytoplasmic region with a short afadin-
binding motif (Takai et al., 2008a,b). The consensus motif was
reported to be E/A-X-Y-V for nectin1, 2, and 3, while nectin4 does
not have this motif but still binds to afadin (Reymond et al., 2001;
Takai et al., 2008a). Reymond et al. (2001) proposed a new consen-
sus motif, K/R-X-X-Y/L-V, for all four nectins. Afadin is an actin
ﬁlament (F-actin)-binding protein, and supports nectins to inter-
act and co-operate with cadherins, other CAMs, and intracellular
signaling molecules (Takai et al., 2008a).

Nectins are expressed as dimers, and interact in trans with
other nectin dimers expressed on neighboring cells (Takai et al.,
2008a,b). All nectins show homophilic interactions, while het-
erophilic interactions are also observed between speciﬁc nectins,
such as those between nectin1/nectin3 and nectin 2/nectin3 (Takai
et al., 2008a,b). Some nectin-like molecules also interact with
nectins (Takai et al., 2008a,b). Nectin4 shows homophilic inter-
actions as well as heterophilic interactions with nectin1 (Rey-
mond et al., 2001; Takai et al., 2008a). The Ig V-like domain
is used for the trans-interaction (Reymond et al., 2001; Fabre
et al., 2002). Nectins play key roles in the initiation of AJ for-
mation, and regulate various physiological functions of epithelial
cells, such as contact inhibition of cell movement and prolifera-
tion, survival, differentiation, and cell polarization (Takai et al.,
2008a,b).

Although nectin1 and nectin2 are expressed in a broad range
of tissues, the expression of nectin3 and nectin4 is more spe-
ciﬁc (Reymond et al., 2001). Reymond et al. (2001) and Brancati
et al. (2010) showed that human nectin4 is expressed mainly
in the placenta and to lesser extents in the trachea, prostate,
lung, and stomach. In addition, Brancati et al. (2010) demon-
strated nectin4 expression in human keratinocytes, suprabasal

nucleated layers of the epidermis, and non-keratinized struc-
tures of hair. Some levels of expression in epithelial cells of the
tonsil, oral mucosa, esophagus, and nasopharynx have also been
reported (www.proteinatlas.org). Although, in many cases, nectin4
is expressed in low or undetectable levels in normal human tissues,
many cancer cells are highly positive for nectin4. Thus, it has been
proposed that nectin4 is a new tumor-associated marker (Fabre-
Lafay et al., 2007; Takano et al., 2009; Derycke et al., 2010). These
observations may provide a rationale for the use of MV as an
oncolytic agent (Mühlebach et al., 2011). In humans, mutations
in the PVRL4 gene encoding nectin4 cause ectodermal-dysplasia-
syndactyly syndrome (EDSS), in which patients have affected skin
and skin appendages, such as hair, teeth, and nails (Brancati et al.,
2010; Jelani et al., 2011).

RELEVANCE OF SLAM/CD150 AND NECTIN4 TO MV
PATHOGENESIS
The pathology of measles can now be drawn with these two recep-
tors (Figure 3). Although nectin4-expressing epithelial cells can be
the initial targets of MV, no or very limited infection of epithelia
was observed in monkeys experimentally infected with MV at the
early days after infection (Ludlow et al., 2010; Lemon et al., 2011).
Instead, MV initiates its infection via SLAM-mediated entry into
alveolar macrophages and DCs in the lung or respiratory tracts
(de Witte et al., 2008; de Vries et al., 2010; Lemon et al., 2011).
These infections may allow MV to penetrate into the human body
and reach the lymphoid organs or tissues, where SLAM/CD150-
expressing cells are abundant (Corry et al., 1984; Lehmann et al.,
2001). After initial replication in these lymphoid organs or tissues,
MV or MV-infected lymphocytes can easily enter the bloodstream.
Subsequently, a dramatic MV infection is observed in all lym-
phoid organs, such as the spleen, thymus, appendix, tonsil, and
lymph nodes, throughout the body (Moench et al., 1988; Kobune
et al., 1996; de Swart et al., 2007; de Vries et al., 2010). At the
time when the MV infection of lymphoid organs reaches its peak,
MV infection of epithelia, such as squamous stratiﬁed epithelia
of the tongue and buccal mucosa and ciliated epithelia of the
trachea, becomes evident (Nii et al., 1964; Olding-Stenkvist and
Bjorvatn, 1976; Moench et al., 1988; de Swart et al., 2007). This
epithelial infection is probably led by MV-infected immune cells
and initiated through the basolateral side, since monkeys infected
with MV often show infectious foci in the epithelia with MV-
infected lymphoid or myeloid cells in the subepithelial cell layers
of the trachea, bronchus, and tongue (de Vries et al., 2010; Ludlow
et al., 2010). The H protein expressed on MV-infected immune
cells that migrate through the epithelial cell layer likely recognizes
nectin4 expressed at AJs, triggering F protein-mediated mem-
brane fusion between the MV-infected immune cells and the target
epithelial cells. Mühlebach et al. (2011) demonstrated a correlation
between nectin4 expression and MV infection in epithelia in vivo.
Importantly, MV has a mechanism that further facilitates virus
shedding in the airway. In epithelia, MV selectively releases prog-
eny virus particles from the apical membrane to the luminal side
of the respiratory tract (Leonard et al., 2008; Tahara et al., 2008).
Leonard et al. (2008) showed that MV genetically engineered to use
SLAM/CD150, but not nectin4 (nectin4-blind or SLAM/CD150-
tropic), does not shed progeny viruses into the respiratory tract,

subsequently spreads to all lymphoid organs, such as the spleen, thymus,

infection of the lymphoid organs reaches its peak, MV-infected immune cells
transfer MV to epithelial cells through the basolateral side. At this step, MV
uses nectin4 expressed at AJs as a receptor. In the epithelia, MV selectively

although it does show systemic infection of lymphoid organs,
similar to the case for wt MV.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Membrane cofactor protein/CD46 was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a recep-
tor for MV (Dorig et al., 1993; Naniche et al., 1993). However, our
current knowledge of MV receptors has been totally transformed.
In 2000, it was shown that SLAM/CD150 expressed on cells of the
immune system, but not MCP/CD46, is a real receptor for wt MV.
However, recent studies further showed that SLAM/CD150 is not
the sole receptor for MV. MV has an intrinsic ability to enter not

only immune cells but also epithelial cells. In 2011, a clear answer
was obtained through the identiﬁcation of the epithelial MV recep-
tor nectin4, which is expressed at AJs, thereby partly explaining
why MV exhibits its highly contagious nature (Mühlebach et al.,
2011; Noyce et al., 2011). Recent studies on MV receptors greatly
advanced our understanding of MV pathogenesis. However, many
aspects and molecular mechanisms underlying immunosuppres-
sive effects and a highly contagious nature of MV still remain to
be elucidated. Analyses of physiological roles of MV receptors,
SLAM/CD150, and nectin4, would provide deep insights into MV
pathogenesis.
