Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the analysis of microbial communities in diverse
environments, including the human body. This article reviews several aspects of one of these technologies,
the pyrosequencing technique, including its principles, applications, and significant contribution to the
study of the human microbiome, with especial emphasis on the oral microbiome. The results brought about
by pyrosequencing studies have significantly contributed to refining and augmenting the knowledge of the
community membership and structure in and on the human body in healthy and diseased conditions. Because

Culture has been traditionally used for identifica-

tion of bacteria in the oral cavity, but over the
last two decades culture-independent molecular
biology methods have been increasingly used. These
methods have substantially refined and redefined the
knowledge of the microbial diversity in the different oral
habitats and expanded the list of candidate pathogens
associated with oral infectious diseases (14).

Specifically, the adoption of 16S rRNA gene amplifi-
cation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by
cloning and Sanger sequencing, allowed an even more
comprehensive broad-range investigation of oral bacterial
communities. Studies using this approach have revealed
that the oral microbiota is more diverse than previously
demonstrated by culture methods and that 4060% of
the bacterial taxa found in the mouth have not yet been
cultivated and validly named (16). Cataloguing the
bacterial taxa found in healthy and diseased conditions
by broad-range methods has allowed further closed-
ended molecular studies to target both cultivable and
as-yet-uncultivated taxa in multiple samples, revealing
several new candidate pathogens involved as for instance
with caries (7), periodontal diseases, (8) and endodontic
infections (9). In spite of these recent advances, technical
difficulties and high cost associated with the cloning and
Sanger sequencing approach make it difficult to analyze a

large number of clones from a large number of samples.
Consequently, the method is expected to reveal only the
dominant members of the bacterial community.

Recently, new methods for high throughput DNA
sequencing have been introduced. Because the Sanger
method is considered as the ‘first-generation’ technology,
these newer approaches have been regarded as next-
generation DNA sequencing (NGS) technologies. Of the
NGS techniques,
the pyrosequencing method has
been possibly the most widely used in medical micro-
biology. This approach has been recently introduced in
oral microbiology research. Pyrosequencing technology
provides a large number of sequence reads in a single
run, resulting in very large sampling depth and allowing
detection not only of
the most dominant microbial
community members but also of the low-abundance
(rare) taxa (10, 11). Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA

environments has demonstrated
that the microbial diversity can be orders of magni-
tude higher than appreciated by previous technologies
(10, 11).

The Sanger sequencing approach
The Sanger approach has stood as the gold standard
DNA sequencing technique over the last three decades.
In brief, the automated Sanger approach comprises the
following steps: DNA purification, DNA synthesis,
and labeling using the chain termination method with
dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), capillary elec-
trophoresis, and fluorescence detection.

In the last years,

the automated Sanger method
has evolved to generate longer sequence reads of up to
800 bases. The outstanding contribution of Sanger
sequencing to scientific advances in diverse areas is
incalculable. In oral microbiology, numerous studies
have used broad-range PCR, followed by cloning, and
Sanger sequencing to unravel the microbiota associated
with diverse oral sites in healthy (12, 13) and disease
conditions, including caries (3, 1416), endodontic infec-
tions (4, 6, 1720), periodontal diseases (1, 5, 2123),
periimplantitis (24), and halitosis (2, 25). Collectively,
these studies complemented the data from previous
culture studies to reveal that more than 1,000 different
bacterial species-level taxa belonging to 13 phyla colo-
nized the human oral cavity (26). Six bacterial phyla
(Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria,
Spirochaetes, and Fusobacteria) contained the huge
majority of oral representatives. Not all of these spe-
cies-level taxa were present in the same mouth at any one
time, and a particular individual usually harbored about
100200 taxa (27). Whereas some species were common
to different oral sites,
the majority of species were
selective for a particular site (12). Regardless of the site,
as much as 50% or more of the detected taxa have been
demonstrated to be as-yet-uncultivated bacteria (28).

NGS technologies
Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies that per-
mit massive sequencing with a much higher throughput
than the Sanger method have become recently available.
The first commercially available NGS platform was
introduced in 2005 and as of then NGS methods have
revolutionized the
(29).
The five most currently used NGS technologies include
the
(Roche Applied Science,
Basel, Switzerland), Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) SOLiD (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), the HeliScope Single
Molecule Sequencer (Helicos BioSciences, Cambridge,
MA, USA), and the Single Molecule Real Time technol-
ogy (SMRT, Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA).
These platforms share a common technologic character-
istic of performing massively parallel sequencing, either
of clonally PCR-amplified products (the first three plat-
forms) or even of single DNA molecule (the last two),
based on physical separation in a flow cell surface. This
feature diverges from the classic Sanger technique that is

based on electrophoretic separation of chain-termination
products.

454 Pyrosequencing
The 454 pyrosequencing technology is probably the
most used NGS platform to study the human micro-
biome and because of this the focus of this review relies
on it. This technology is a sequencing-by-synthesis
method that
emulsion

generation after nucleotides are incorporated in a grow-
ing chain of DNA. This approach requires no gels,
fluorescent dyes, or ddNTPs.

involves a combination of

In the pyrosequencing approach, DNA is isolated,
fragmented, ligated to special adapters, and separated
into single strands. Emulsion PCR is then carried out
for clonal amplification. In this approach, an oilwater
emulsion is formed in which the aqueous phase contains
the PCR reagents and the DNA template to be seq-
uenced. Capture beads containing one of the oligonu-
cleotide primers attached to them are also included. This
oligonucleotide is complementary to one of the adapter
sequences used in library construction. The other PCR
primer is placed in the solution. Beads are included
in excess of DNA template molecules, but not of the
expected number of droplets to be formed in the emul-
sion. After controlled and vigorous agitation of the oil
water system, emulsification takes place and millions of
aqueous droplets are formed, within which PCR amplifi-
cation takes place. Optimization of the concentration of
DNA template, beads, and water droplets guarantees
that only one template and one bead occur in each
droplet. Then, million copies of a unique DNA template
are generated on each bead in a clonal PCR amplification.
The possibility of more than one bead or template
occurring per droplet is greatly reduced by concentration,
and in case it occurs, the mixed DNA sequence that forms
is ultimately filtered out by the software (30).

Next, the emulsion is broken, the DNA is denatured,
and beads carrying single-stranded DNA are transferred
to the wells of a picotiter plate in such a way that it permits
a single bead to occur in each of the several hundred
thousand wells. Because each bead has a fixed location in
the plate, each sequencing reaction can be monitored.
Beads containing the enzymes used in the pyrosequencing
reaction steps are then deposited into each well (31, 32).
The pyrosequencing reaction takes place using a
mixture of the single-stranded DNA template, the sequen-
cing primer, and the enzymes DNA polymerase, ATP
sulfurylase, luciferase, and apyrase (Fig. 1). Two sub-
strates are also included in the reaction  adenosine
5‘ phosphosulfate (APS) and luciferin. The first one
of the four deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) is added to the
sequencing reaction, and the DNA polymerase catalyzes
its incorporation into the DNA strand,
in case there

sequence reads and output. The first-generation instru-
ment (GS 20) yields 100 bp sequence reads and up to
60 Mb per individual run. The second-generation instru-
ment (GS FLX) yields 250 bp sequence reads and up
to 150 Mb per run. The third-generation (XLR and now
GS FLX Titanium) yields 400 bp sequence reads and
about 500 Mb per run. Recently, the GS FLXwas
released, which offers read lengths up to 1 kb with a
mode read length of 700 bp.

Other NGS platforms
The Applied Biosystems Sequencing by Oligonucleotide
Ligation and Detection (SOLiD) system is based on
sequencing-by-ligation technology. In the SOLiD app-
roach, sequencing is obtained by measuring serial ligation
of an oligonucleotide to the sequencing primer by a
DNA ligase enzyme (33). Like in pyrosequencing,
DNA fragments are ligated to oligonucleotide adapters,
attached to beads, and then amplified by emulsion PCR
to provide sufficient signal for the sequencing reactions.
Beads are deposited on a flow cell surface, and the ligase-
mediated sequencing begins by annealing of the sequen-
cing primer to the adapter sequences on each amplified
fragment. In a unique approach of sequencing using
interrogation probes, each ligation step is accompanied
by fluorescence detection, after which a regeneration
step prepares the extended primer for the next round
of ligation (29, 31). The newest sequencers using this
technology can generate sequence reads that are 50 to
75 bp long.

The Illumina/Solexa sequencing platform is based
on the sequencing-by-synthesis principle and is similar
to the Sanger method in that it also relies on dye
terminator nucleotides incorporated in the sequence by a
DNA polymerase. Nonetheless, Illumina/Solexa termina-
tors are reversible, permitting polymerization to proceed
even after fluorophore detection. In this method, DNA
fragments are immobilized on a flow cell surface and
bridge PCR is used for amplification (34). The DNA
sequencing is initiated with addition of the sequencing
primer, DNA polymerase, and four reversible dye termi-
nators. Fluorescence is recorded after incorporation by a
four-channel fluorescent scanner (33). The newest sequen-
cers using this technology can generate sequence reads
that are about 100 bp long.

The HeliScope System by Helicos Biosciences is a
single molecule sequencing platform that also utilizes
the sequencing-by-synthesis principle. In the HeliScope
platform, single DNA molecules are sequenced directly,
obviating the need for a previous clonal PCR amplifica-
tion step. The sample DNA is fragmented and polyade-
nylated at the 3’ end, with the final adenine being labeled
with Cy3 (34). The poly-A template molecules are
captured by hybridization to poly-T oligonucleotides
immobilized on a flow cell surface. Because templates

is complementarity. During each incorporation event, a
phosphodiester bond between the dNTPs is formed,
releasing pyrophosphate (PPi) in a quantity equivalent
to the amount of incorporated nucleotide. In sequence,
the enzyme ATP sulfurylase converts PPi to ATP in the
presence of APS. ATP is used in the conversion of luciferin
to oxyluciferin mediated by the enzyme luciferase. This
gives rise to light in intensity that is proportional to
the amount of ATP used. Light is detected by a charge
coupled device camera and detected as a peak in a
pyrogram. The height of each peak is proportional to
the number of nucleotides incorporated. The system is
regenerated with the enzyme apyrase that degrades ATP
and unincorporated dNTPs. Then, the next dNTP is
added. Addition of dNTPs is performed one at a time.
Generation of a signal indicates which nucleotide is the
next one occurring in the sequence. As the process goes on,
the complementary DNA strand grows and the nucleotide
sequence is determined according to the signal peaks in
the pyrogram.

The 454 pyrosequencing technology has evolved over
the years, with consequent increase in the length of

are fluorescently labeled, imaging can identify the array
coordinates, where a sequencing read is expected. The
label is then cleaved and sequencing proceeds by adding
the DNA polymerase and each of four Cy5-labeled
nucleotides to the flow cell (29). Fluorescent imaging
detects incorporation into the individual strands. After
chemical cleavage of the label, the cycle is repeated for
the next nucleotide. Pacific Biosciences is another com-
pany that has developed another single molecule sequen-
cing platform, the SMRT technology (35).

Table 1 depicts many of the features of the most
currently used NGS technologies. For a more detailed
description of the NGS technologies and chemistries,
the reader is referred to some comprehensive reviews
(29, 31, 34, 36).

Advantages and limitations of pyrosequencing
One of the greatest advantages of the massive parallel
pyrosequencing approach over the Sanger sequencing
method is that hundreds of thousands of sequence reads
can be obtained in a single run, generating sequence
information data that are orders of magnitude larger
(37). Moreover, the cost per base is much lower for
pyrosequencing when compared with the Sanger method.
This has also helped to widely expand the utilization
of DNA-sequencing approaches. Another advantage of
the pyrosequencing technique is that it also avoids the
biases inherent to the cloning procedure.

In the pyrosequencing method, sequences from differ-
ent samples can be identified in the same run using the
barcoding multiplex approach, in which unique sequences
are incorporated into the primers and barcoded amplicons
are generated (38). This multiplex approach increases
efficiency and throughput, and reduces costs (10, 39).

The high throughput of the pyrosequencing method
impacts on both sampling depth (number of sequences per
sample) and breadth (number of samples or individuals
analyzed). A greater sampling depth permits a better
coverage of one individual sample, increasing the chances
of detecting rare species and is of extreme importance for
ecological studies. A greater sampling breadth permits to
examine more samples or subjects, providing results that
are more robust for comparisons. Depending on the
goal of the study and the type of samples analyzed,
the researcher should decide on which is better suited to

his/her purposes. When comparing microbial commu-
nities from different sites, it has been argued that NGS
platforms can be most wisely utilized to study more
samples (breadth) rather than more sequences per sample
(depth) (40). However, if the samples to be compared
come from the same or closely related sites, deeper
sequencing may be necessary to reveal minor differences
in the community composition (41).

As with any other method, pyrosequencing has also its
limitations. Most of them are common to other culture-
independent molecular methods and were reviewed else-
where (42). A limitation inherent of the pyrosequencing
approach refers to detection of
long homopolymers
(repeated nucleotides), which can result in sequencing
errors. Most of the pyrosequences contain none or only a
few errors, but a few of them may contain sufficient errors
to be interpreted as a rare operational taxonomic unit
(OTU),
inflating richness estimates. Several strategies
have been proposed to deal with these noises (43).

The short length of reads generated by the NGS
technologies may also represent a limitation when bacter-
ial identification is intended. It is recognized that less
phylogenetic information is available from short sequence
reads than from near full length of the 16S rRNA gene.
Indeed, there are still some bacterial species for which
sequencing of the entire 1,500-bp 16S rRNA gene is
required for reliable identification (44). Furthermore,
sequencing of the entire 16S rRNA gene is often required
for description of a new species. However, it has been
commonly accepted that sequencing the initial 500-bp
region of this gene may suffice for distinguishing a large
number of human-associated bacteria (44).

Most of the currently used NGS platforms generate
sequence reads that are too short in length. Because of
the short sequence reads, bacterial identification using
these methods has focused primarily on hypervariable
regions of the 16S rRNA gene. It has been shown that
reads spanning these particular regions of the 16S rRNA
gene can still be highly informative and that despite
the shorter read lengths, the pyrosequencing approach
provides a description of the microbiome that is in
good agreement with that provided by the cloning and
Sanger sequencing approach in terms of higher taxo-
nomic levels and relative abundance values (45, 46).

Although the first pyrosequencing technologies resulted
in short reads,
the most recent third generation of
pyrosequencing (GS FLX Titanium) produces an average
read length of more than 400 bp. This increases the
phylogenetic information and permits identification of
many taxa to the species level. Nevertheless, for over-
all community analyses, it has been shown that commu-
nities
subjected to GS FLX Titanium sequencing
after amplification with the V1V3 and V3V5 regions
resembled communities analyzed with GS FLX sequen-
cing after amplification with the V1V2 region (47).
Further advances in technology hold the perspective of
generating longer sequence reads.

As discussed before,

Pyrosequencing data analysis
When used to explore the diversity of prokaryotic com-
munities, pyrosequencing analysis relies on the use of
segments of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene or 16S
rRNA gene that includes one or more of the hyper-
variable regions, and that provide the highest discrimina-
tion among microorganisms (Fig. 2). Hypervariable
regions 16 (or V1V6) have been commonly used.
relatively short

reads
present some problems in taxonomic assignments of the
sequences. Therefore, the technology is generally much
more effective in the identification of higher level taxo-
nomic assignments such as phyla, classes, orders, families,
and genera, than species or strains. In fact, although
there are some attempts
to identify actual species
using pyrosequencing, most bioinformatics experts agree
that this area still needs additional efforts to resolve.
A reasonable compromise is to define the number of
different OTUs at the common 97, 95, or 90% levels.

Given that there are a large number of sequences

Pyrosequencing and the oral microbiome

determine if the number of reads was sufficient to identify
most microorganisms in a sample. This is commonly
done by an analysis of rarefaction curves of the OTUs
(48). A rarefaction curve plots the number of sequences
analyzed on the Y-axis and the number of OTUs on
the X-axis. If
the resultant curve shows a plateau,
then sufficient richness was present in the sample and
was analyzed to define all the component microorgan-
isms. Clearly, the higher the percentage of similarity
among OTUs that are selected (i.e. closer to species
designation), the more difficult it is to establish a plateau
and the more sequences are needed for identification of
all microbial taxa present. This is an additional reason
for the inability of the technology to define species
with precision.

As discussed above, there is a potential for exaggeration
of richness and diversity estimates caused by low-quality
pyrosequencing reads. Reads with multiple errors can
form new OTUs if they are more distant from their
true source and commonly occur as singletons or
doubletons (49). Therefore, bioinformatics tools have
been developed to remove low-quality reads, which is
now essential to do before analysis is performed. Addi-
tionally, sequences that occur less than three times are
usually excluded (50).

The assignment of taxonomy to sequences, annota-
tions, and functional analysis can be done using a variety
of online tools, mostly in the public domain, such as
BLAST programs from GenBank at the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the Ribosomal
Database Project (RDP) (51), Greengenes (52), GAST
(45), and the MG-RAST server (53). For studies of
the oral microbiome, the HOMD (26) and CORE (54),
which are curated 16S rRNA databases, are highly
recommended.

Another metric that is used for sequence analysis is
UniFrac (55, 56). Overall, bacterial community composi-
tion in different individuals, sites within an individual, or
in a site at different time periods can be compared
using the unweighted (qualitative) or weighted (quanti-
tative) UniFrac distance metric. This is a phylogenetic
tree-based metric ranging from 0 (distance between
identical communities) to 1 (distance between totally
different communities with no shared ancestry). UniFrac
analysis allows the determination of whether the micro-
bial populations overall are likely to be similar or distinct
from each other (57).

General application of pyrosequencing
technology in microbiology
The most important use of pyrosequencing in micro-
biology is in the efficient analysis of large amounts of
sequences, whether from a single genome, single gene, or
a community of microorganisms. Single genome analysis
is typically done for sequencing of the genome of an
organism of interest due to pathogenicity or prevalence.
Currently, over 1,500 bacterial, 19 fungal, and 2,700
viral genomes have been fully sequenced (58). The speed
of completion of genome sequences is increasing with
rapid advances in sequencing technology. Genome ana-
lyses allow the understanding of virulence, metabolism,
and structure of an organism as well as identify targets
for antimicrobial agents. They also provide the basis
for metagenomic analyses of complex microbiological
communities (see below).

The study of microbial communities using pyrosequen-
cing may be limited to the analysis of the 16S rRNA gene
of the bacteria and archaea (or 18S rRNA gene for
eukaryotes) in the community, or the analysis of random
fragments of genomic DNA of the organisms present,
commonly known as shotgun sequencing. The generation
of massive genomic sequences reveals a large amount of
data on the definition of normal microbiomes in different
body areas, and the pathogenesis of disease. The massive
amount of sequencing that has taken place in the last
decade has served in understanding pathogenesis of
diseases and developing new therapeutic modalities in
multiple ways. Thus, genome sequencing may help in
identifying microbial strains responsible for outbreaks of
disease, tracking evolutionary history and disease spread,
developing new diagnostic tests based on PCR technol-
ogies or DNA microarrays, or identify new strategies for
drug targets or vaccines (58). This analysis provides a
powerful tool for understanding gene expression, protein,
and metabolite profiles of the microbiome of microor-
ganisms in a community. Even if these microorganisms
are cultivable in the laboratory, their genomic, proteomic,
and metabolomic profiles are more likely to be different
in the artificial environment than they are in the natural
habitat (59).

Pyrosequencing was initially used to compare micro-
bial communities in samples from distinct environmental
ecosystems, in a rapid and relatively inexpensive manner
(60). It was then used in research questions related
to human health, with novel findings. For example,
16S rRNA gene analysis of human digestive tract
microbiomes in three locations revealed that the throat
and stomach microorganisms were closer to each other,
whereas fecal communities clustered separately (61). A
more extensive 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analysis
of mothers and newborns born by cesarian or vaginal
delivery showed that not only are microbial compositions
remarkably different in different body habitats but also
that newborn microbial acquisition depended on the
mode of delivery and may play a role in affecting their
future health (62). Other studies using pyrosequencing to
study the human microbiome are reviewed in the next
sections.

Pyrosequencing analysis of the human
microbiome
The resident microbiota has been regarded as integral
to the host’s health. This is because the resident micro-
bial communities have been shown to assist digestion,
provide vitamins, confer resistance against exogenous
pathogens, regulate metabolism, and stimulate the im-
mune system (63). Therefore, deciphering the human
microbiome in health and disease assumes great relevance
toward a better understanding of these processes and has
the potential to serve as a background for establishment
of diagnostic, preventive, or therapeutic measures for
numerous conditions.

In 2007, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH)
launched an international collaborative project termed
Human Microbiome Project
(http://commonfund.nih.
gov/hmp/) pointing to the need to characterize the
diversity of the microbiome of
the human body in
different sites, including oral, nasal, skin, gastrointestinal,
and urogenital regions, and to determine how changes
in the human microbiome affect health and disease (64).
Massively parallel pyrosequencing has been widely used
in studies with these purposes. One of the main focuses
of these studies has been to define a core microbiome
across individuals (65). The core microbiome can be
understood as those microbial taxa (but also genes) that
are shared by all or the great majority of humans.
Some authors have even used this term to mean the
taxa present in most individuals.

Most studies have focused exclusively on a given site
and will be reviewed in the next section. In a compre-
hensive study that compared the human microbiome
from diverse sites, Costello et al. (55) used a multiplexed
barcoded pyrosequencing approach to evaluate samples
from 27 distinct body sites of healthy adults on four
occasions. Sampled sites included the oral cavity, gut,

and skin surfaces. The V2 region of the 16S rRNA
gene was targeted to generate a dataset of about 1 million
sequences (average of 1,315 sequences/sample). Overall,
the detected taxa comprised representatives of 22 bacter-
ial phyla. Of these, 92% of the sequences belonged to
four phyla: Actinobacteria (37%), Firmicutes (34%),
Proteobacteria (12%), and Bacteroidetes (9.5%). Each
body site was found to harbor a unique microbiota and a
group of dominant taxa that remained stable over time.
Low-abundance taxa varied significantly. A high inter-
individual variability was found within sites.

Gut
Bacterial diversity in the gut
The gut contains the largest number of microorganisms
associated with the human body and is regarded as one
of the most densely populated microbial ecosystems on
this planet (66, 67). In a study by Turnbaugh et al. (68),
the pyrosequencing approach was used to evaluate the
diversity of bacterial communities in fecal samples from a
monozygotic twin pair. Findings were also compared to
communities from the gut and other body sites of related
and unrelated individuals. The V2 region of the 16S
rRNA gene was targeted to generate approximately
1.21.5 million sequencing reads. The total diversity of
species-level bacterial phylotypes in the reads obtained
from each twin was about 800. Most species-level
phylotypes were present at low abundance. A comparison
across 27 body habitats demonstrated high levels of
diversity. The combined data from the 27 body sites
revealed an estimated 4,949 species-level phylotypes.

A study of rural children in Burkina Faso and in
Italy analyzed approximately 440,000 sequences from the
V5V6 regions of the 16S rRNA gene and showed
that the Bacteroidetes phylum was far more abundant
in microbiomes of African children, with a unique
abundance of bacteria from the genus Prevotella and
Xylanibacter (69). Most Bacteroidetes representatives
detected in the African children are known to have genes
for cellulose and xylan hydrolysis, indicating that they are
possibly involved in obtaining energy from the plant-rich
diet. Moreover, Enterobacteriaceae taxa were significantly
underrepresented in African children when compared
to Italian children. These findings pointed to the fact
that microbiomes vary geographically with their hosts,
and diet may be one factor involved with such a variation.

Gut microbiome in obese individuals
Community profiling analysis of the human gut micro-
biome using cloning and Sanger sequencing disclosed a
higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in obese individuals
than in lean individuals (70). Furthermore, a barcode
pyrosequencing approach has been successfully proposed
and used to determine the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio
in the gut microbiota of obese humans (71), with the

potential of reducing costs, and increasing depth of
coverage.

The microbial community structures of individuals with
normal weight, morbidly obese, or postgastric-bypass
surgery were investigated in a study using pyrosequen-
cing (72). Analysis of approximately 180,000 sequences
spanning the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene demon-
strated that members of the Firmicutes phylum were
dominant in normal-weight and obese individuals, but
significantly decreased in postgastric-bypass individuals.
The latter had a proportional increase in Gammaproteo-
bacteria. Prevotellaceae were highly enriched in the
obese individuals. Three other families, namely Coriobac-
teriaceae (phylum Actinobacteria), Erysipelotrichaceae
(phylum Firmicutes), and Alcaligenaceae (phylum Proteo-
bacteria), were also more abundant in obese subjects.
Verrucomicrobia were generally rare in obeses but abun-
dant in the other individuals. The main conclusions of
this study were that despite interindividual differences,
obesity and gastric-bypass clearly affected the intestinal
microbiome.

In an analysis of the influence of host genotype,
environmental exposure, and host adiposity on the gut
microbiome, Turnbaugh et al. (73) characterized the fecal
microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and
dizygotic twin pairs matched for leanness or obesity,
and their mothers. The authors analyzed about 10,000
near full-length and 2 million partial (V2 and V6 regions)
16S rRNA gene sequences as well as more than 2 Gb
from the microbiomes of 154 individuals. The gut
microbial community of each individual varied in the
specific bacterial taxa detected. One interesting finding
from this study is that a core microbiome at the species
level was not observed. Instead, a wide array of microbial
genes was shared among individuals, comprising a
core microbiome at a functional level. Obese individuals
were associated with changes in the microbiota at the
phylum level and a significant decrease in diversity.

Gut microbiome in diabetics
The composition of the gut microbiota in type-2 diabetic
individuals was compared to non-diabetic individuals
(controls) by a study using pyrosequencing targeting the
V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (74). Analysis of nearly
700,000 sequences showed that the proportion of mem-
bers of the Firmicutes phylum was significantly higher
in the controls when compared with diabetics. Moreover,
the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio correlated positively
and significantly with plasma glucose concentration.
Class Betaproteobacteria was highly enriched in diabe-
tics compared to non-diabetic subjects and positively
correlated with plasma glucose. The authors concluded
that type-2 diabetes may be associated with changes
in the gut microbiome composition, especially at the
phylum and class levels.

Gut microbiome in autistic subjects
Finegold et al. (75) used the pyrosequencing approach
to examine the fecal microbiota of
subjects with
various severities of autism, siblings not showing autistic
symptoms (sibling controls), and non-sibling control
subjects. At the phylum level, members of Bacteroidetes
were found at high levels in the severely autistic group,
whereas members of Firmicutes were dominant
in
controls. At the species level, Desulfovibrio species and
Bacteroides vulgatus occurred in significantly higher
numbers in severely autistic children than in controls.
Higher bacterial diversity was disclosed in the feces of
autistic individuals when compared with controls. The
authors emphasized that it remains uncertain whether
autism leads to changes in the gut microbiota or the
changed microbiota exerts any influence on the disease
or its syndromes.

Gut microbiome as influenced by antibiotics
Some studies have used pyrosequencing to investigate
the impact of systemic antibiotic therapy on the gut
microbiome. Dethlefsen et al. (76) surveyed the distal
gut bacterial communities of healthy individuals before
and after treatment with ciprofloxacin. Their analyses
involved more than 7,000 full-length rRNA sequences
and over 900,000 pyrosequencing reads from V6 and V3
variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Ciprofloxacin
treatment influenced the abundance of about one-third
of the bacterial taxa in the gut, decreasing the commu-
nity diversity. The magnitude of this effect varied among
individuals. Despite disturbance, the community mem-
bership had largely returned to the pretreatment state
within 4 weeks, which is suggestive of community
resilience. However, several taxa failed to recover within
6 months.

In a further study, Dethlefsen and Relman (63)
examined the distal gut microbiota of individuals over
10 months, which included two courses of therapy with
ciprofloxacin. Analysis of more than 1.7 million pyrose-
quencing reads spanning the V1, V2, and V3 regions of
the 16S rRNA gene revealed that the effect of ciproflox-
acin on the gut microbiome was profound and rapid,
with a significant decrease in diversity and a shift in
community composition developing within 34 days of
antibiotic initiation. One week following the end of
each antibiotic course, the bacterial communities started
to return to their initial state. However, return was
frequently incomplete. In all individuals, the composition
of the gut microbiota was stabilized by the end of the
study, even though it was altered from its initial state.

The short- and long-term effects of clarithromycin and
metronidazole treatment on the microbiota of the lower
intestine and throat were investigated by Jakobsson et al.
(77). While the microbial communities of untreated
control subjects were relatively stable over time, a

decreased diversity of the gut and throat microbiomes
was apparent immediately after the antibiotic therapy. A
dramatic decline in Actinobacteria in both feces and
throat was observed immediately after
treatment.
Although the bacterial diversity subsequently returned
to the pretreatment states, perturbation remained in some
cases for up to 4 years following the antibiotic therapy. In
conclusion, the authors reported that a common 1-week
antibiotic treatment regimen with clarithromycin and
metronidazole resulted in a long-term impact in both
throat and gut microbiomes.

Skin
Considering the whole area available for colonization,
the skin is certainly one of the largest microbial habitats
associated with the human body. In the study by
Costello et al. (55) using pyrosequencing to evaluate the
microbiome in different body regions, very interesting
results were reported for the skin. Clustering of the
sequences obtained revealed different groups: a ‘head’
group, including the forehead, external nose, external ears,
and hair, where Propionibacterineae prevailed (6080%);
and an ‘arm’ group,
including forearms, palms, and
index fingers, where Propionibacterineae were less abun-
dant (2040%). Separate clusters were evident for sites
on the trunk and legs, which were dominated by Staphy-
lococcus species (armpits and soles of
the feet) or
Corynebacterium species (navel and back of the knees).
The highest levels of bacterial diversity were observed
in the forearms, palms, index fingers, back of the knees,
and soles of the feet.

The bacterial communities on the palm surfaces of
both the dominant and non-dominant hands of under-
graduate students were assessed using pyrosequencing
(78). Analysis of more than 330,000 sequences spanning
the V1V2 regions of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a
high bacterial diversity that was higher in women than
in men. A typical palm hand surface harbored more
than 150 unique species-level taxa. A total of 4,742
unique taxa were detected across all of
the hands
examined. Although representatives of 25 phyla were
disclosed, more than 90% of the sequences belonged
to three phyla (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteo-
bacteria). The most abundant genera on nearly all palm
surfaces were Propionibacterium, Streptococcus, Staphy-
lococcus, and Corynebacterium. Even though a core
microbiome was observed on the palm surface, pro-
nounced intra- and interindividual variations in the
bacterial community composition were reported. Inter-
estingly, hands from the same individual shared only
17% of their taxa, whereas hands from different indivi-
duals shared 13%.

Another study from the same group (57) revealed
the stability and uniqueness of the skin microbiome
among a group of individuals tested for their use of

computer keyboards and mouse. The discrimination
between individuals was stronger with the unweighted
UniFrac metric than with the weighted metric, suggesting
that differences
in community membership (rather
than community structure) discriminated best among
individuals.

Vagina
The vagina is known to harbor a resident microbiota
that is important for maintaining vaginal health and
preventing infections such as bacterial vaginosis, yeast
infections, urinary tract infections, and sexually trans-
mitted diseases. In the first study to use pyrosequencing
for the analysis of the vaginal microbiome, Sundquist
et al. (79) obtained 100,000200,000 sequence reads of
about 100 bp length and confirmed that Lactobacillus
is the dominant genus in the vagina. They also detected a
significant presence of other genera, including Psychro-
bacter, Magnetobacterium, Prevotella, Bifidobacterium,
and Veillonella.

Another study compared the diversity of the vaginal
microbiome in women with bacterial vaginosis as com-
pared to healthy women from China using several
culture-independent methods, including pyrosequencing
(80). Analysis of ca. 250,000 pyrosequencing reads of
the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that
there was a significant interindividual variability in the
bacterial communities. Overall, the most predominant
bacterial phyla were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actino-
bacteria, and Fusobacteria. Of these, Firmicutes was
the most dominant
in healthy individuals, whereas
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobac-
teria constituted the complex vaginal microbiota in the
vaginosis group. Eight bacterial genera, namely Gardner-
ella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Aerococcus,
Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Prevotella, and Papillibacter, were
strongly associated with vaginosis. The vaginal bacterial
diversity in women with vaginosis was remarkably higher
when compared with the healthy controls.

The vaginal microbiome of asymptomatic North
American women from four ethnic groups (white, black,
Hispanic, and Asian) was evaluated by pyrosequencing
of V1V2 regions of the 16S rRNA gene (81). Data
consisting of about 900,000 sequences with an average
length of 240 bp revealed that the vaginal bacterial
communities clustered into five groups. Four were domi-
nated by Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus,
Lactobacillus gasseri, or Lactobacillus
jensenii. The
fifth one had fewer lactobacilli and higher proportions
of anaerobic bacteria,
including Prevotella, Dialister,
Atopobium, Gardnerella, Megasphaera, Peptoniphilus,
Sneathia, Eggerthella, and Finegoldia. Interestingly, all
communities contained members known to produce
lactic acid, including Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Mega-

Pyrosequencing and the oral microbiome

sphaera, and Atopobium. This study found no single
core microbiome for the human vagina.

Other sites and conditions
Nasopharynx and oropharynx
Charlson et al. (82) used pyrosequencing to analyze
the microbiome from the nasopharynx and oropharynx
of smoking and non-smoking healthy adults. Analysis
of nearly 800,000 sequences encompassing the V1V2
regions demonstrated that the microbiota from smokers
was significantly more diverse than non-smokers and
clustered separately. The distributions of several genera
were systematically altered by smoking in both the
nasopharynx and oropharynx, and there was an enrich-
ment of obligate anaerobes in the oropharynx. The
authors concluded that distinct regions of the human
upper respiratory tract contain typical microbial commu-
nities, with altered patterns observed in smokers. These
have the potential to influence the prevalence of respira-
tory tract complications in these individuals.

Chronic wounds
Biofilm infections have been considered as the primary
impediment to the healing of chronic wounds. Dowd
et al. (83) used pyrosequencing to evaluate the bacterial
diversity of chronic diabetic foot ulcers and observed that
the most prevalent bacterial genus associated with these
wounds was Corynebacterium. Obligate anaerobes,
in-
cluding members from the genera Bacteroides, Peptoni-
philus, Finegoldia, Anaerococcus, and Peptostreptococcus,
also comprised a significant portion of the wound biofilm
communities. Other major components of the bacterial
communities included Streptococcus, Serratia, Staphylo-
coccus, and Enterococcus.

In another study, the same group (84) surveyed samples
from three types of chronic wound types: diabetic foot
ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. Analysis
of 129,000 pyrosequencing reads spanning the V4V6
regions disclosed specific major bacterial communities
that were evident in the biofilms of all chronic wound
types, including Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Peptoni-
philus, Enterobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Finegoldia, and
Serratia. Specifically, the predominant bacterial taxa in
venous leg ulcer biofilms were Enterobacter, Serratia,
Stenotrophomonas, and Proteus species. In diabetic foot
ulcers,
the predominant genera were Staphylococcus,
Peptoniphilus, Rhodopseudomonas, Enterococcus, Veillo-
nella, Clostridium, and Finegoldia. Pressure ulcer biofilms
were dominated by species from the genera Peptoniphilus,
Serratia, Peptococcus, Streptococcus, and Finegoldia.
Each of the wound types revealed marked differences in
bacterial community structure. In another study evaluat-
ing samples from venous leg ulcers, Wolcott et al. (85)
confirmed that polymicrobial communities commonly
colonize the wounds. Predominant
taxa included a

previously uncharacterized bacteroidales, various anae-
robes, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Serratia.

Smith et al. (86) used pyrosequencing to identify
bacterial populations in decubitus ulcers. Analysis of
nearly 220,000 sequences longer than 350 bp and inclu-
ding the V1V3 regions demonstrated that the biofilm
associated with decubitus ulcers was polymicrobial
in nature and characterized by a great interindividual
variability. A total of 228 genera and 487 predicted
species were identified from 49 wounds. Several genera
and species were found in high percentage in indivi-
dual wounds. Species that predominated in several cases
were Corynebacterium striatum, Streptococcus agalactiae,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Anaerococcus species, Serratia
marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus
faecalis. Several anaerobic species were detected.

Other infectious diseases
Several studies have used the pyrosequencing technology
to successfully detect pathogens associated with neonatal
sepsis (87), brain abscess (88), and diarrhea (89). A study
(90) described the incorporation of pyrosequencing for
routine pathogen identification of atypical isolates in a
children’s hospital. Using pyrosequencing, isolates that
lacked a definitive identification by culture and bio-
chemical testing yielded genus- or species-level identi-
fications in approximately 90% of cases. The authors
concluded that coupled with culture, pyrosequencing-
based bacterial identification can be a valuable tool for
improved bacterial identification in a pediatric hospital
setting.

Pyrosequencing analyses of the oral
microbiome
A number of laboratories are currently working on
analyzing the oral microbiome in health and disease.
Traditional research questions such as the comparison
between the oral microbiomes in healthy and diseased
sites in the same oral cavity, in healthy and diseased
patients, in diseased patients following treatment proce-
dures, and in patients with normal health and those with
systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and athero-
sclerosis are being explored using the pyrosequencing
technology. The intent is to gain better understanding
of the pathogenesis of oral microbial disease, of virulence
determinants that lead to extensive disease, and lack of
response to therapy or the interrelationship of oral and
systemic diseases.

Using 454 GS FLX pyrosequencing, an analysis of
71 saliva and 98 supragingival samples revealed a total
of 28,978 unique V6 tag sequences from 22 known
phyla (91). However, 99.6% of these sequences belonged
to one of the seven major phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacter-
oidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spir-
ochetes, or candidate division TM7. There was much

the bacterial

more diversity in plaque bacteria versus those in saliva,
with 267 versus 185 different genera, and 10,000 versus
5,600 OTUs at the 3% difference, respectively. Despite
this high number of OTUs,
richness
estimated from rarefaction curves indicated that the
richness is incomplete, that is, these numbers did not
reveal all the bacterial taxa present. Nevertheless, relative
abundance of the phylotypes indicates that the majority
of OTUs present had low abundance and that
the
1,000 most abundant OTUs account for 9095% of
all sequences. Further analysis by the same group of
children of various ages revealed that in deciduous teeth
dentition, Proteobacteria were prominent, but with a
change to permanent dentition, Bacteroidetes, the Veillo-
nellaceae family, Spirochaetes, and candidate division
TM7 increased (92). Further extensive analyses of the
oral microbiome in multiple sites from three individuals
revealed remarkable consistency among them in that
47% of OTUs (at 3%) and 72% of higher taxa were
common among them (49). Within an individual oral
cavity, over 3,600 sequences comprising over 500 species-
level phylotypes and 88104 higher taxa (genus level or
above) were found. The abundant phylotypes and relative
abundance in the three oral microbiomes are shown
in Fig. 3.

Pyrosequencing combined with UniFrac analysis has
also shown that the oral microbiome is relatively stable
within the same individual, in three samples collected
over 1 month, allowing for subject-specific grouping (93).
This finding could potentially lead to future uses of
salivary samples in forensic identification of individuals,
as was noted with skin samples before.

These findings are typical of the characteristics of
complex microbial populations, as would be expected in
the oral cavity. Examining microbial niches that are
more isolated and localized may reveal less complexity
and allow more effective comparisons among patients
with different presentations of disease. Therefore, a
pyrosequencing analysis was performed recently of mi-
croorganisms in seven primary and persistent endodontic
infections. Endodontic infections would be expected to
be less complex than microbiomes in saliva or plaque
(94). In addition, a comparison was made in this study
of the microbial diversity with pyrosequencing using
the 16S rRNA tag sequences in the second generation
454 GS FLX platform and traditional Sanger sequencing
of cloned 16S rRNA gene. Pyrosequencing yielded a
600-fold increase in depth of coverage compared to
Sanger sequencing. Using the RDP-II Classifier, analysis
at different taxonomic ranks showed that Sanger sequen-
cing and pyrosequencing yielded 8 versus 13 phyla,
10 versus 22 classes, 11 versus 43 orders, 20 versus 97
families, and 25 versus 179 genera, respectively. These
results showed that even in the relatively isolated root
canal environment, significant microbial diversity exists,

and that pyrosequencing allowed much better character-
ization of the endodontic microbiome than did tradi-
tional Sanger sequencing.

These findings for endodontic infections were con-
firmed and expanded by another study using pyrosequen-
cing, this one investigating the bacterial diversity of the
communities established specifically in the apical root
canal (95). DNA extracts from cryopulverized apical
root segments of 10 extracted teeth with primary apical
periodontitis were subjected to multiplex tag-encoded GS
FLX Titanium pyrosequencing. The sequences obtained
were taxonomically classified into 187 bacterial species-

level OTUs (at 97% similarity), 84 genera, and 10 phyla.
The most represented, abundant, and prevalent phyla
were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobac-
teria, and Actinobacteria. The majority of species-level
phylotypes occurred at low levels. The mean number
of species-level phylotypes per sample was 37, ranging
from 13 to 80. A great interindividual variation in the
composition of the apical microbiota was evident.

In another study of the endodontic microbiota using
pyrosequencing, Santos et al. (96) compared samples from
acute (symptomatic) or chronic (asymptomatic) endodon-
tic infections. Overall, about 900 bacterial species-level

OTUs (at 97% similarity) belonging to 67 genera and 13
phyla were detected. The most abundant phyla in acute
infections were Firmicutes (52%), Fusobacteria (17%),
and Bacteroidetes (13%), whereas in chronic infections the
dominant phyla were Firmicutes (59%), Bacteroidetes
(14%), and Actinobacteria (10%). Members of Fusobac-
teria were much more prevalent in acute than in chronic
cases. The most abundant/prevalent genera in acute
infections were Fusobacterium and Parvimonas. Twenty
genera were exclusively detected in acute infections and 18
in chronic infections. Only 18% of the OTUs were shared
by acute and chronic infections. Acute infections were
significantly more diverse
infections.
Although a high interindividual variation in bacterial
communities was observed, many samples tended to group
together according to the type of infection (acute or
chronic), which may suggest the existence of patterns
related to disease severity.

than chronic

The root canal environment is normally sterile, and
therefore, the use of this highly sensitive and powerful
technology to identify microbial resistance to endodontic
treatment modalities is likely to be very important in
future, particularly with the growing need to reach a
high degree of root canal disinfection in preparation
for regenerative endodontic procedures (97).

A comparison was recently reported between microbial
analysis of oral samples using 454 pyrosequencing and
targeted identification by DNA microarray with the
human oral microbe identification microarray (HOMIM)
(98). Oral lavage samples were collected from 20 indivi-
duals. Correlations and relative abundance were com-
pared at phylum and genus levels, between 16S rRNA
sequence read ratio and HOMIM hybridization intensity.
The major phyla present were identified with high
correlation by the two methods (r0.700.86). 16S
rRNA gene pyrosequencing identified 77 genera and
HOMIM identified 49. There were 37 genera detected
by both methods, and contained more than 98% of
the classified bacteria. Concordance by the two meth-
ods and correlations were high for common genera
(Streptococcus, Veillonella, Leptotrichia, Prevotella, and
Haemophilus). This again shows that the data revealed
by pyrosequencing add depth of coverage and better
definition of diversity of the sample compared to other
microbial analysis methods. It is salient to point out that
although pyrosequencing revealed more taxa, HOMIM
identifies taxa at the species level and specifically those for
which there are probes.

In the realm of the relationship of oral and systemic
disease, a recent study used 454 pyrosequencing to examine
the relationship between oral (periodontal swab), gut,
and atherosclerotic plaque samples in 15 atherosclerosis
and 15 control patients (99). Unweighted UniFrac analysis
revealed strong clustering by body site indicating distinct
overall microbial communities in the three locations.

Although the OTU analysis did not show differences
between the oral samples in atherosclerotic and control
individuals, OTUs from three genera were found to
be in the same consensus lineage between oral and
atheroma samples: Veillonella (7 OTUs from 11 patients),
Streptococcus (17 OTUs from 6 patients), and Propioni-
bacterium (4 OTUs from 8 patients). In addition, the
abundance of Fusobacterium was positively correlated
with levels of cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (p0.028
and 0.005, respectively) (99).

As discussed before, the oral metagenome can be
analyzed beyond the 16S rRNA gene data. This has
been carried out using both the Roche 454 pyrosequencing
and Illumina GA iiX platforms to pooled plaque samples
of volunteers (100). This analysis required a significant
amount of DNA and was done in a way to avoid sampling
of human DNA. The authors concluded that using the
31 phylogenetic marker genes for community profiling
may yield more accurate estimates than 16S rRNA-
based assays because of the presence of a single copy for
each marker per microbial genome.

Finally, the oral fungal microbiome (mycobiome) was
investigated in 20 healthy individuals by pyrosequencing
(101). The oral fungal microbiome was found to be
diverse as revealed by the presence of 74 culturable
and 11 non-culturable fungal genera. Fifteen genera
(which included four known pathogenic fungi and non-
culturable organisms) were present in 20% or more of
the tested samples; Candida species were the most
frequently obtained genera,
isolated from 75% of all
study participants,
followed by Cladosporium (65%),
Aureobasidium (50%), Saccharomycetales (50%), Asper-
gillus (35%), Fusarium (30%), and Cryptococcus (20%).

Future perspectives
The advent of massively parallel pyrosequencing has
allowed the development of large population-based stu-
dies of the microbiome of diverse human body sites. The
results brought about by these studies have significantly
contributed to refining and augmenting the knowledge
of the community membership and structure in and
on the human body in healthy and diseased conditions.
As most of the oral infectious diseases are now regarded
as biofilm-related polymicrobial infections, these high-
throughput technologies have the potential to revolutio-
nize our knowledge of the oral microbiome in the sense
that specific patterns related to health or disease may be
identified. This can have important implications in terms
of accurate diagnosis and more effective preventive and
therapeutic measures. Additionally, these methods can
be used for metagenomic analyses, permitting not only
to identify the microbial species present but also to
screen their genomes for functional roles and pathogenic
potential in the communities.

Despite the limitations of pyrosequencing, namely the
cost, need for large amounts of DNA, complexity of
analysis, and relatively short reads, the increasing avail-
ability of massive computing power and the efficiency
of data generation and analysis are likely to render this
technology a major player in the field of microbiology
in the near future. There is an obvious tendency for still
greater advances and decreased costs. Therefore, one
may envision the possibility of NGS technologies being
established as the main diagnostic means for microbial
infections in clinical laboratories.

Conflict of interest and funding
There is no conflict of interest in the present study for
any of the authors.
