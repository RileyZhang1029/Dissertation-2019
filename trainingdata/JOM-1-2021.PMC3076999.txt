Background: In vivo-induced antigen technology was previously used to identify 115 genes induced in
Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 during human infection. One of these, PG2197, a conserved hypothetical
protein which has homology to a Zn-dependent protease, was examined with respect to a role in disease.
Design: The expression of PG2197 in human periodontitis patients was investigated, but as there is increasing
evidence of a direct relationship between P. gingivalis and cardiovascular disease, a mutation was constructed
in this gene to also determine its role in adherence, invasion, and persistence within human coronary artery
endothelial cells (HCAEC) and neutrophil killing susceptibility.
Results: Plaque samples from 20 periodontitis patients were analyzed by real-time PCR, revealing that
PG2197 was expressed in 60.0% of diseased sites compared to 15.8% of healthy sites, even though P. gingivalis
was detected in equal numbers from both sites. The expression of this gene was also found to be up-regulated
in microarrays at 5 and 30 min of invasion of HCAEC. Interestingly, a PG2197 mutant displayed increased
adherence, invasion, and persistence within HCAEC when compared to the wild-type strain.
Conclusion: This gene appears to be important for the virulence of P. gingivalis, both in vivo and in vitro.

An estimated 80% of American adults currently

have some form of periodontal disease. In 2000,
the cost of therapy in the USA for the treatment
of periodontal disease was estimated at $56 billion (1).
Periodontitis is an inflammation of the periodontium
that results in destruction of the bone and connective
tissue attachment of the teeth. Periodontal diseases can
range in severity from the mildest form, gingivitis, to the
more common, chronic periodontitis, to the most severe,
necrotizing periodontal disease (2). The major character-
istics of the disease are microbial plaque formation,
periodontal inflammation, loss of attachment and alveo-
lar bone, and consequent periodontal pocket formation
(3). Porphyromonas gingivalis is recognized as an impor-
tant bacterial species in the pathogenesis of periodontitis
and is most often isolated from subgingival sites (47).

Many elements of periodontitis can be attributed to
virulence factors from P. gingivalis, such as proteolysis,
edema, neutrophil accumulation, and bleeding on prob-
ing (8). This bacterial species is also capable of invading
several epithelial and endothelial cell
lines including
human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) (9,
10). Cellular invasion is a mechanism by which bacteria
can evade host immunologic defenses. Previous studies
on the invasion of HCAEC by P. gingivalis were
performed in relation to an epidemiological and experi-
mental
link observed between cardiovascular disease
and the presence of periodontal pathogens such as
P. gingivalis (913). Gene expression during invasion of
HCAEC was also determined and microarray analyses
demonstrated that 62 genes were differentially regulated
(14).

Virulence gene expression is modulated by bacteria in
response to their environment (15). Previously, in vivo-
induced antigen technology (IVIAT) (16) identified 115 P.
gingivalis genes that were induced in vivo in humans during
periodontal disease (17). One of the genes identified,
PG2197 (conserved hypothetical protein, J. Craig Venter
Institute; http://cmr.jcvi.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/shared/Ge
nePage.cgi?locusPG_2197), has domain homology to a
Zn-dependent protease with chaperone function and may
be an HtpX homologue. HtpX is a stress-controlled
protease identified in Escherichia coli (18) that is under
control of the two-component stress response system Cpx
(19, 20). In this study, RT-PCR and real-time PCR were
used to probe patient plaque samples to confirm in vivo
gene expression of PG2197. In addition, microarrays were
used to examine differential expression of PG2197 during
co-cultivation with HCAEC. Additionally, a mutation was
constructed in PG2197 and the mutant, as well as the
parent strain were tested for (1) the ability to adhere,
invade, and persist within HCAEC and (2) the ability to
survive phagocytosis by mouse neutrophils.

Materials and methods

Bacterial and cell culture conditions
P. gingivalis W83 and W83D2197 were grown as described
elsewhere (21). HCAEC (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) were
maintained at 378C with 5% CO2 in endothelial cell basal
medium-2 (EBM-2)
supplemented with EGM-2-MV
singlequots (Lonza) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. HCAEC were seeded at 1105 cells/well into
24-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight in
antibiotic-free EBM-2.

RNA sample collection
P. gingivalis W83 cultures were grown in supplemented
brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and subcultured. RNA
was extracted as described below. Using criteria described
elsewhere (22) and after Institutional Review Board
approval, subgingival plaque samples were collected from
two healthy and two diseased sites from 20 patients using a
Gracey curette. Plaque was removed from the curette by
sterile paper point and placed into 1 mL of Trizol
(Invitrogen). Samples were vortexed and stored at 808C
for subsequent RNA extraction.

RNA isolation and reverse transcription (RT)
RNA isolations were performed by using Trizol and the
RNeasy kit (Qiagen) with DNase treatment as described
elsewhere (12). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed
by using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
and random hexamer primers (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s protocol, reactions were incubated at
488C for 16 hours. cDNA samples were purified by using
the PCR purification kit (Qiagen) following the manu-
facturer’s protocol.

standard curves. All real-time PCR reactions were run
with an annealing temperature of 558C. Data normal-
ization and analysis were performed by using iCycler and
Microsoft Excel software. Gene expression was normal-
ized to the P. gingivalis 16S rRNA expression.

Mutant construction
W83D2197 was constructed by allelic replacement as
described elsewhere (21). Briefly, upstream and down-
stream regions of PG2197 were amplified by PCR using
gene-specific primers (Table 1) and cloned into the suicide
vector pPR-UF1. This vector has been described pre-
viously (11). The mutation was confirmed by PCR and
growth curves were performed to confirm that growth
rate was not altered (data not shown). The mutation was
not expected to cause any polar effects since PG2197 does
not appear to exist in an operon.

Adhesion assays
Adhesion assays were performed as described elsewhere
(23) with minor modifications. P. gingivalis W83 or
W83D2197 from overnight cultures were added to anti-
biotic-free EBM-2 and bacteria were allowed to adhere to
HCAEC at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 for 30
min at 48C. Non-adherent bacteria were washed away
with cell-culture medium. Cells and adherent bacteria
were fixed with 5% formalin for 15 min at 378C, washed,
and then blocked (5% BSA, 1% goat serum, and 0.1%
Tween20 in PBS)
for 1 hour at room temperature.
Adherent bacteria were detected with polyclonal rabbit
anti-P. gingivalis serum followed by a horseradish perox-
idase (HRP)-labeled mouse anti-rabbit antibody (Cappel,
Solon, OH). An ELISA was performed to confirm that
the polyclonal antibody bound similarly to both W83 and
W83D2197. Colorimetric substrate 3,3?,5,5?-tetramethyl-
benzidine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to each well
and incubated with the cells for 5 min at room tempera-
ture. The reaction was stopped with the addition of an
equal volume of 1 N HCl and the OD450 was measured
with an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad). Wells containing
cells alone or cells and bacteria with no primary antibody
were used as controls.

Invasion and persistence assays
Invasion and persistence assays were performed as
described previously (11). A total of 105 HCAEC/well
were seeded into a 24-well
tissue culture plate and
incubated at 378C overnight. P. gingivalis W83 or
W83D2197 was added at a concentration of 107 bacterial
cells/ml per well (MOI of 100) and bacteria were allowed to
invade the cells for 1.5 hours. After washing, 300 mg/mL
gentamycin and 200 mg/mL metronidazole were added to
kill extracellular bacteria. After an additional 1-hour
incubation, the cells were washed and either lysed with 1
mL of water for 20 min and plated for enumeration on

blood agar plates or antibiotic-free medium was added to
the cells before reincubating. In the later case, at 6, 12, and
24 hours post-inoculation, the supernatant was collected
and centrifuged at 600g for 5 min. The pelleted bacteria
were resuspended in PBS and plated on blood agar to
enumerate
extracellular bacteria. Subsequently,
HCAEC were lysed with water and intracellular bacteria
were enumerated by plating on blood agar. All individual
cell culture experiments were performed by using triplicate
wells and each experiment was performed three times.

Microarray hybridizations and data analysis
P. gingivalis W83 microarray glass slides (version 2) were
obtained from J. Craig Venter
(http://
www.jcvi.org/). HCAEC were infected as described above
with P. gingivalis W83. After 5 and 30 min, total RNA
was isolated from internalized bacteria, RT and micro-
array reactions were performed as described elsewhere
(14). Control reactions by using broth cultures and data
analysis were done as described previously (14).

Institute

Neutrophil killing
The susceptibility of P. gingivalis to neutrophil killing was
measured as described previously with minor modifica-
tions (24). Briefly, overnight cultures of E. coli S17-1
(control) and P. gingivalis W83 and W83D2197 were
pelleted and resuspended to 1108 CFU/mL in PBS.
Each bacterial suspension (70 mL) was opsonized with 50
mL of polyclonal rabbit anti-P. gingivalis serum. After
opsonization, 0.5 mL of the neutrophil suspension (5105
polymorphonuclear leukocytes) was added to the bacteria/
serum mixture and incubated at 378C at 300 rpm in a
thermomixer. After 4 hours, a 30 mL sample was collected,
diluted, and plated. Experiments were performed in
triplicate.

Statistical analysis
Comparisons between groups were done by using a
Student t-test. Data that were not normally distributed
were compared by using the MannWhitney Rank sum
test. Differences in proportions were compared by using
the Fisher’s exact test plus Yate’s correction. A value of
PB0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Confirmation of in vivo-induced antigen technology
(IVIAT) gene expression in patient plaque samples
Real-time PCR was used to assay in vivo expression of
gene PG2197 in plaque samples from human period-
ontitis patients. No statistically significant differences
were observed in P. gingivalis detection (P0.05) be-
tween the plaque sites; 73.5% of samples taken from the
diseased sites were positive for P. gingivalis as measured
by previously reported P. gingivalis-specific 16S primers

(22) while 54.3% of healthy plaque samples tested positive
for P. gingivalis. However, when comparing the expres-
sion pattern in diseased versus healthy plaque sites,
PG2197 was expressed significantly more in diseased
sites (60.0%) than in healthy sites (15.8%, PB0.01).

Microarray experiments
Analysis of microarrays showed that a total of 160
P. gingivalis genes were differentially regulated at 5 min
and a total of 67 genes were differentially regulated at 30
min of co-culture with HCAEC (Fig. 1). Of these, 18
genes were differentially regulated at both time points. At
5 min of contact, 56 and 104 genes were up and down-
regulated, respectively (data not shown). At 30 min, 13
and 54 genes were up and down-regulated, respectively
(data not shown). Gene PG2197 was, among those, found
to be up-regulated at both the time points, 3.0 and
4.5-fold at 5 and 30 min, respectively. These data were
confirmed by Real-Time PCR by using P. gingivalis-
specific primers showing a 4.3 and 5.4-fold up-regulation
when compared to the control.

Adherence, invasion, and persistence
Mutant W83D2197 demonstrated significantly enhanced
adherence to HCAEC at 30 min when compared to W83
(2.6-fold, PB0.001, Fig. 2A) and the ability to invade
HCAEC was also increased by 2.3-fold for W83D2197 at
2.5 hours (PB0.01, Fig. 2B). However, when invasion
efficiency was normalized to the adherence data,
W83D2197 showed no increase in invasion. The persis-
tence of W83 and W83D2197 within HCAEC was also
examined. The results are expressed as the percentage of
the wild-type that was recovered at 2.5 hours post-
inoculation (Fig. 3). After 6 hours, more W83D2197
were recovered from the medium (3.6-fold, P0.06, Fig.
3A) than W83, although not statistically significant. After
12 hours, a similar percentage of W83D2197 was
recovered from within the cells when compared to W83
(Fig. 3B). However, at 6 and 24 hours greater numbers of
W83D2197 (1.6-fold, PB0.05; 3.1-fold, PB0.05) were
recovered when compared to W83 (Fig. 3B).

Neutrophil killing
There was no statistical difference in the susceptibility to
killing by neutrophils when P. gingivalis W83D2197 was
compared to W83 (Fig. 4).

Discussion
Previously, IVIAT was used to identify immunogenic
bacterial genes of P. gingivalis expressed specifically
during infection but not in regular culture conditions
(11). One of the genes identified by this technique,
PG2197, is described as a conserved hypothetical protein
and likely localizes to the inner or outer membrane
(PSORT). PG2197 domain homology is recognized as a

4

(page number not for citation purpose)

Zn-dependent protease with chaperone function. This
class of metalloproteases belongs to the MEROPS pepti-
dase family M48 and often is described as probable HtpX
homologues (25). As IVIAT has previously identified in
vivo-expressed genes that are likely related to virulence,
characterization of this newly discovered gene in P.
gingivalis was pursued to determine its relation to disease.
This study reports that the PG2197 gene is significantly
expressed in periodontitis disease sites (60%), but it is not
frequently expressed in healthy sites (16%) even though
P. gingivalis was detected in equal amounts from both sites.
Thus, PG2197 shows a correlation to disease. Previously,
we have reported that another IVIAT identified gene of
P. gingivalis W83 (PG1334; a band 7/MEC-2 family gene)
also had a higher expression in diseased sites versus
healthy sites and again P. gingivalis was present in similar
amount in both sites (11). Detection of P. gingivalis in
similar frequency from periodontally healthy and diseased
sites is not uncommon and has been previously observed
(26, 27). Therefore, bacteria could be present but not
necessarily expressing virulence genes until a triggering
event happens and initiation of disease occurs.

Since invasion of HCAEC has been used a model of
host/pathogen interactions in relation to cardiovascular
disease (913), microarray analysis was used to identify
those genes of P. gingivalis W83 that are up-regulated in
response to co-culture with HCAEC. This analysis
detected differential expression of 160 and 67 genes during
infection of HCAEC at 5 and 30 min, respectively. Most
pertinent to this study, PG2197, was one of the genes
identified as being up-regulated after only 5 and 30 min of
contact with host cells, suggesting its importance in early
colonization events. To further characterize the phenoty-
pic trait of this gene, a mutation in the gene was
constructed using allelic replacement. The mutant was
tested for its ability to resist killing by mouse neutrophils
and loss of this protein does not impact its susceptibility
to killing by neutrophils. Quantitative invasion assays of
the mutant and wild-type were then performed by using
HCAEC, a cell model previously used to study virulence
factors. Surprisingly, the adherence of W83D2197 was
increased when compared to adherence of the wild-type
strain. As adherence is an initial event in invasion, it is
possible that the enhanced invasion and persistence seen
with the PG2197 mutant were only due to its increased
adherence. This was confirmed when the invasion data
were normalized to the adherence data. Cellular invasion
is an important survival mechanism by which bacteria can
evade host immunologic defenses. P. gingivalis has been
previously shown to use this mechanism for survival (10,
28). Furthermore, extracellular bacteria were also recov-
ered in the medium at all time points for both the wild-
type and the mutant strains. This could be due to cell lysis
and subsequent release of bacteria or by a mechanism
used by P. gingivalis to ensure transmission from one cell

HCAEC at 48C. The P. gingivalis strains were allowed to
adhere to HCAEC for 30 min at 48C (to prevent inter-
nalization of bacteria) before non-adherent bacteria were
washed away. Host cells were then ﬁxed with 5% formalin
and probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-P. gingivalis serum
followed by an HRP-labeled mouse anti-rabbit secondary
antibody. The mutant strain W83D2197 showed enhanced
adherence to HCAEC (2.6-fold, PB0.001). (B) Invasion of

incubation, the cells were washed and lysed. The intracel-
lular bacteria were diluted in PBS and plated for enumera-
tion on blood agar. The PG2197 mutant demonstrated
increased invasive ability at 2.5 hours compared to the
wild-type (2.3-fold, PB0.01).

to another. For example, a recent study demonstrated that
P. gingivalis can exit infected cells and reinfect new host
cells (29). Therefore, intracellular transmission without
host cell lysis could be used as an important survival
mechanism by this periodontal pathogen.

The mechanism by which a mutation in the PG2197
gene affects adhesion to cells is at this point unknown.
Based on homology, PG2197 or HtpX is a membrane-
bound, stress-controlled protease identified in E. coli
whose proteolytic active site is on the cytosolic side of
the inner membrane (19, 20). This protease is under the
control of the Cpx stress response, a two-component
phosphorelay system capable of both autoamplification
and feedback inhibition mechanisms (19, 20). The Cpx

extracellular bacteria. After an additional hour, the cells
were again washed and antibiotic-free medium was added to
the wells. At 6, 12, and 24 hours post-inoculation, the
supernatants were collected, centrifuged the pelleted bacteria
were resuspended in PBS and plated on blood agar to
enumerate the extracellular bacteria (A). When compared to
W83, more W83D2197 were recovered from the medium at 6
hours (3.6-fold, P0.06) although the difference was not
statistically signiﬁcant. In addition for (B), the infected
HCAEC were washed and lysed with water to enumerate
intracellular bacteria in a similar manner. More W83D2197
(1.6-fold, PB0.05; 3.1-fold, PB0.05) were recovered at 6
and 24 hours when compared to the wild-type strain, W83.

stress response may also become activated by the loss of
HtpX function (20). In addition, it has been suggested that
this system is important in the regulation of virulence
factors. For example, Cpx regulates VirF in Shigella,
which in turn activates the transcription of genes necessary
for host-cell invasion (30). Furthermore, Cpx-regulated
DsbA and DegP are essential for pili assembly on the
surface of uropathogeneic E. coli (31, 32). Homologues for
the two components of the Cpx system appear to exist in
P. gingivalis: PG1797 (CpxA) and PG1089 (CpxR). If
PG2197 is related to HtpX, then it is conceivable that this
gene is regulated by a similar two component-response

resuspended to 1108 CFU/mL in PBS. Seventy ﬁve
microliters of each bacterial suspension was opsonized with
50 mL of polyclonal rabbit anti-P. gingivalis serum. After
opsonization, 0.5 mL of the neutrophil suspension (5105
PMN) was added to the bacteria/serum mixture. The
mixtures were incubated at 378C at 300 rpm in a thermo-
mixer, and a 30 mL sample was diluted and plated after 4
hours. There was no statistical difference in the susceptibility
to killing by neutrophils of P. gingivalis W83D2197 when
compared to the wild-type. This experiment was performed
in triplicate.

system. It is plausible that, similar to the loss of HtpX
activating the Cpx system, the loss of PG2197 could
activate its homologous response system and lead to up
regulation of other virulence factors. This may explain the
enhanced adhesion, invasion and persistence seen with the
PG2197 mutant. Future experiments are needed to clarify
the role of this gene including characterization of the
proteolytic activity of PG2197 and determination if this
gene is a component of the Cpx system.

In conclusion, PG2197 appears to be important for the

virulence of P. gingivalis, both in vivo and in vitro.
