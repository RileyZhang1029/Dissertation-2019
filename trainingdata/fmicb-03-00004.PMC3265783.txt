Addition of straw is common practice in rice agriculture, but its effect on the path of micro-
bial CH4 production and the microbial community involved is not well known. Since straw
from rice (C3 plant) and maize plants (C4 plant) exhibit different 13δ C values, we compared
the effect of these straw types using anoxic rice ﬁeld soils from Italy and China, and also a
soil from Thailand that had previously not been ﬂooded. The temporal patterns of produc-
tion of CH4 and its major substrates H2 and acetate, were slightly different between rice
straw and maize straw. Addition of methyl ﬂuoride, an inhibitor of acetoclastic methano-
genesis, resulted in partial inhibition of acetate consumption and CH4 production.The 13δ C
of the accumulated CH4 and acetate reﬂected the different 13δ C values of rice straw versus
maize straw. However, the relative contribution of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis to
total CH4 production exhibited a similar temporal change when scaled to CH4 production
irrespectively of whether rice straw or maize straw was applied. The composition of the
methanogenic archaeal communities was characterized by terminal restriction fragment
length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and was quantiﬁed by quantitative PCR targeting
archaeal 16S rRNA genes or methanogenic mcrA genes. The size of the methanogenic
communities generally increased during incubation with straw, but the straw type had lit-
tle effect. Instead, differences were found between the soils, with Methanosarcinaceae
and Methanobacteriales dominating straw decomposition in Italian soil, Methanosarci-
naceae, Methanocellales, and Methanobacteriale in China soil, and Methanosarcinaceae
and Methanocellales in Thailand soil. The experiments showed that methanogenic degra-
dation in different soils involved different methanogenic population dynamics. However,
the path of CH4 production was hardly different between degradation of rice straw versus
maize straw and was also similar for the different soil types.

INTRODUCTION
Methane production in rice ﬁelds is driven by the anaerobic degra-
dation of organic matter. The organic matter that is converted into
CH4 is basically derived from three different sources, i.e., straw, soil
organic matter (SOM), and plant photosynthesis (Watanabe et al.,
1999). Addition of straw, which is common practice in rice agricul-
ture to improve soil fertility, enhances CH4 production in ﬂooded
rice ﬁelds and results in increased CH4 emission (Schütz et al.,
1989; Denier van der Gon and Neue, 1995; Watanabe et al., 1995;
Yan et al., 2005). Under such conditions, CH4 production derived
from SOM can be negligible in comparison to that derived from
straw (Chidthaisong and Watanabe, 1997; Watanabe et al., 1998).
The methanogenic degradation of straw is achieved by fermenta-
tion producing acetate and H2/CO2 as major intermediates from
which CH4 is formed (Glissmann and Conrad, 2002). Besides rice
straw also the addition of straw from other plants, e.g., vetch, rape
seed, wheat, was studied (Cai et al., 2001; Ma et al., 2008). However,

maize straw has not received much attention, despite the fact that
crop rotation between maize and rice has recently increased and
is now already covering about 3.5 million hectare in Asia (Timsina
et al., 2010).

Both rice and maize straw consist mainly of cellulose (30–40%),
hemicellulose (25–35%), and lignin (4–8%; Tian et al., 1992; Singh
et al., 2011). However, maize is a C4 plant while rice is a C3 plant
resulting in distinct δ13C values of the plants and their degrada-
tion products. While plants with a C3 photosynthesis have δ13C
values on the average of about −27‰, plants with a C4 photo-
synthesis have much higher δ13C values, about −13‰ (Farquhar
et al., 1989). This difference in natural 13C abundance has been
exploited to study carbon turnover in soil (Amelung et al., 2008),
for example, to determine the partitioning between CO2 derived
from root organic matter versus SOM (Balesdent and Balabane,
1992; Hanson et al., 2000; Kuzyakov, 2006). Such determination of
partitioning is possible by measuring the δ13C of CO2 produced

Methanogenesis in rice ﬁeld soil

in a ﬁeld that undergoes vegetation change from C3 to C4 plant or
vice versa (e.g., Rochette et al., 1999; Flessa et al., 2000; Kuzyakov
and Cheng, 2001).

The partitioning of the CH4 emission should in principle also
be possible and would be of great interest in order to allow better
management of this important greenhouse gas. However, parti-
tioning studies have so far only been conducted by pulse labeling
experiments with 13CO2. These studies indicate that about 50% of
the CH4 emitted may originate from the rice plants, either by root
exudation or root decay (Minoda and Kimura, 1994; Watanabe
et al., 1999). However, pulse labeling experiments are cumber-
some and invasive. Experiments using the natural abundance of
δ13C have so far not been conducted for partitioning the CH4
production. One problem is the potentially large isotopic frac-
tionation factors that are involved in the conversion of organic
matter to CH4 (Conrad, 2005). These fractionation factors are on
the order of 10–70‰ and thus, more than an order of magni-
tude larger than the fractionation factors involved in conversion
of organic matter to CO2, which are only about 1–3‰ (Werth and
Kuzyakov, 2010). The fractionation factors involved in CH4 pro-
duction strongly depend on the path of CH4 formation. Thus, it is
much larger for CH4 formation from H2/CO2 (typically 50–70‰)
than for CH4 formation from acetate (typically 10–20‰; Conrad,
2005). The extent to which H2/CO2 and acetate contribute to CH4
formation thus crucially affects the stable carbon isotope fraction-
ation during CH4 production from organic matter. Since the path
of CH4 production may be dependent on type of organic matter
degraded, we were interested whether methanogenic degradation
of maize straw would be different from that of maize straw.

Methanogenic degradation of organic matter in ﬂooded
soils is achieved by a complex microbial community con-
sisting of hydrolytic, fermenting, and methanogenic microor-
ganisms (Conrad, 2007). The CH4 is usually produced by
acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea. Rice
ﬁeld soils frequently exhibit a rather large diversity of such
methanogenic archaea, including acetoclastic Methanosarcinaceae
and Methanosaetaceae as well as hydrogenotrophic Methanocel-
lales, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanobacteriales. The abun-
dance of methanogens in rice ﬁeld soils is usually rather high
−1 dry soil) throughout the season, even when the
(>106 cells g
soil is drained (Krüger et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2012). Upland soils,
on the other hand, contain only very low numbers (<103) of
methanogens. However, these numbers may dramatically increase
upon ﬂooding of the soil (Peters and Conrad, 1996; Angel et al.,
2011, 2012).

We comparatively studied carbon isotopic fractionation during
CH4 production in three different soils (two rice ﬁeld soils and one
upland soil) amended with either rice straw or maize straw, deter-
mined the paths of CH4 formation and the methanogenic archaea
involved in order to address the following research questions: (1)
Is the relative contribution of hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic
methanogenesis to CH4 production different during degradation
of maize straw versus rice straw; (2) is there a difference when dif-
ferent soils, including rice ﬁeld soil and upland soil, are amended;
(3) how does straw affect the composition and abundance of the
methanogenic archaeal community; and (4) can amendment with
maize straw serve as a labeling technique to determine partitioning
of C-ﬂux to CH4?

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SOIL INCUBATION
Soils were collected from Italy (Vercelli), China (Fuyang), and
Thailand (Suwan). The Italian soil (Vercelli), a silt loam, was origi-
nally from a rice ﬁeld (45.9˚N, 171.6˚E) at the Italian Rice Research
Institute in Vercelli, Italy (Holzapfel-Pschorn et al., 1986), and has
subsequently been used for cultivation of rice in our glasshouse.
The China soil (Fuyang), a clay loam, was collected in 2007 from
a rice ﬁeld (30.1˚N, 119.9˚E) at the China National Rice Research
Institute in Fuyang, Hangzhou (Peng et al., 2008). The Thailand
soil (Suwan), a clay soil, was collected in 2010 from an upland
ﬁeld site (14.6˚N, 101.3˚E) at the National Corn and Sorghum
Research Center of Kasetsart University (Suwanwajokkasikit Field
Corps Research Station), Nakornratchasima province, Thailand
(Thongsaga et al., 2010). The ﬁeld had been cropped with maize
for several years. The content of C (%) of the soils from Ver-
celli, Fuyang, and Suwan was 1.3± 0.01, 2.4± 0.1, and 2.0± 0.1,
respectively. The N content (%) was 0.13± 0.01, 0.25± 0.01,
and 0.19± 0.03, respectively. The soils were air-dried and stored
in dry state at room temperature. This treatment ensures that
methanogenic activity rapidly recovers after ﬂooding (Mayer and
Conrad, 1990). Rice straw originated from rice plants and maize
straw from maize plants, both grown in our glasshouse using Ital-
ian rice ﬁeld soil or commercial standard soil, respectively. The
straw was air-dried and ground using a blender. The C and N con-
tents of maize straw were 40.2% C and 2.4% N, of rice straw 41.7%
C and 0.7% N. The δ13C of the maize straw was −12.97± 0.05‰,
that of rice straw was −30.96± 0.10‰.

Soil slurries were prepared by mixing 600 g dry soil with 600 mL
of deionized, sterile, anoxic water, and incubating the mixture in
2 L bottles under a headspace of N2 at 25˚C for 4 weeks. The soil
slurry was then amended with either rice straw or maize straw at
a ratio of 10 mg dry ground straw per gram dry soil, and aliquots
(10 g slurry) dispensed into 26 mL pressure tubes. The tubes were
closed with black rubber stoppers, ﬂushed with N2, pressurized
to 0.5 bar overpressure, and incubated at 25˚C. The tubes with
soil slurry were prepared in numerous parallels, of which trip-
licates were sacriﬁced for chemical analyses. The gas phase of
some incubations was amended with CH3F, an inhibitor of ace-
toclastic methanogenesis (Janssen and Frenzel, 1997; Conrad and
Klose, 1999b), at a ratio of 1 or 2%. The initial pH values of the
soil slurries were between pH 6.1 (Vercelli) and 7.3 (Suwan), but
upon anoxic incubation narrowed to pH values between pH 6.7
and 7.0.

CHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS
Methane was quantiﬁed in a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped
with methanizer and ﬂame ionization detector, H2 in a GC with
a reduced gas detector (Conrad and Klose, 1999a). The partial
pressures of CH4 measured in the headspace of the incubations
were converted into molar quantities using the molar volumes of
an ideal gas at the different temperatures. The isotopic compo-
sition (δ13C) of CH4 and CO2 were determined in a Finnigan
gas chromatograph combustion isotope ratio mass spectrom-
eter (GC–C–IRMS) system (Thermoquest, Bremen, Germany;
Fey et al., 2004). Concentrations of acetate in the liquid phase
of the soil incubations were analyzed by high pressure liquid
chromatography (HPLC; Krumböck and Conrad, 1991), the δ13C

of acetate by a HPLC–C–IRMS as described before (Conrad et al.,
2007). The δ13C of the methyl group of acetate was determined
by off-line pyrolysis followed by GC–C–IRMS analysis (Conrad
et al., 2007). The C and N content of soil and straw were analyzed
on a CHNS-elemental analyzer by the Analytical Chemical Labo-
ratory of the University of Marburg. The δ13Corg of straw and the
straw-amended soils were analyzed at the Centre for Stable Isotope
Research and Analysis (KOSI) at the University of Göttingen using
an elemental analyzer coupled to an IRMS. The δ13Corg were for
Italian, China, and Thailand soil, respectively, −27.1, −27.6, and
−22.3‰ for rice straw-amended and −24.6,−25.9, and −18.6‰
for maize straw-amended soil.

MOLECULAR ANALYSES
DNA was extracted from the soil using the Fast DNA Spin Kit
for soil (MP, Heidelberg, Germany) following the manufacturer’s
instructions as described in detail by Kolb et al. (2005). DNA
extraction was optimized to obtain maximum copy numbers of
archaeal 16S rRNA in quantitative PCR (qPCR; see below), which
was by combining the DNA from 1, 2, and 3 extractions for soil
from Vercelli, Suwan, and Fuyang, respectively. The analysis of
terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of
archaeal 16S rRNA genes was done as described (Chin et al.,
1999) using the primer combination Ar109f/Ar915r (Grosskopf
et al., 1998), with the reverse primer labeled with FAM (6-
caboxyﬂuorescein). The 16S rRNA gene amplicons were digested
with TaqI (Fermentas, St. Leon Rot, Germany), and the prod-
ucts were size-separated in an ABI 3130 DNA sequencer (Applera,
Darmstadt, Germany). The abundance of total archaeal 16S rRNA
gene copies was determined by qPCR (Angel et al., 2011, 2012).
The abundance of individual groups of archaea was calculated
from the relative abundances of their T-RFs multiplied with the
copy numbers of total archaeal 16S rRNA genes determined by
qPCR (Conrad and Klose, 2006). The abundance of total copies
of the mcrA gene, coding for a subunit of the methyl coenzyme
M reductase of methanogens was also determined (only in Suwan
soil) by qPCR (Angel et al., 2011). The abundance of individual
groups of methanogens (only in Suwan soil) was determined by
TaqMan qPCR targeting speciﬁc 16S rRNA gene sequences (Yu
et al., 2005) as described by Angel et al. (2012).

Values of δ13C are deﬁned by
δ13C = 103 (Rsa/Rst − 1)

with R = 13C/12C of sample (sa) and standard (st) respectively,
using VPDB carbonate as standard. Fractionation factors for a
reaction A→ B are deﬁned after (Hayes, 1993; Angel et al., 2012):
αA,B = (δ13CA + 1000)
(δ13CB + 1000)

sometimes expressed as isotopic enrichment factor ε≡ 1− α (in
units of per mile). The fractionation factor for conversion of CO2
to CH4 is given by

assuming that acetoclastic methanogenesis was then completely
inhibited.

Relative contribution of H2 + CO2-derived CH4 to total CH4

was determined using the following mass balance equation
(Conrad, 2005):

− δ13CCH4−ma)
(δ13CCH4−mc − δ13CCH4−ma)

fCO2,CH4
where fCO2,CH4 is the fraction of CH4 formed from H2 + CO2,
δ13CCH4 the δ13C of total produced methane, δ13CCH4−mc the
δ13C of CH4 derived from H2 + CO2, and δ13CCH4−ma the δ13C
of CH4 derived from acetate determined by:
δ13CCH4−ma = δ13Cac−methyl + εac,CH4
where δ13Cac−methyl is the δ13C of the methyl group of acetate
accumulated and εac - methyl,CH4 is the isotopic enrichment factor
(equivalent to αac - methyl,CH4) during acetoclastic methanogene-
sis. It is assumed, that the methyl group of acetate was converted
= −15‰, which is close to the val-
to CH4 with εac - methyl,CH4
ues determined previously for straw-amended or acetate-amended
rice ﬁeld soil dominated by Methanosarcina species as acetoclastic
methanogens (Penning and Conrad, 2007; Goevert and Conrad,
2009).

RESULTS
METHANE PRODUCTION
Methane was produced from each soil amended with either rice
straw or maize straw (Figure 1). Vigorous CH4 production started
after about 2 days in soil from Vercelli and Fuyang, and after about
7 days in soil from Suwan. The soil from Suwan was not an authen-
tic rice ﬁeld soil and had so far not been ﬂooded. Note that the
soil from Suwan was preincubated under anoxic conditions with-
out straw amendment for 38 days before the experiment shown
in Figure 1C was started. Furthermore, in contrast to soils from
Vercelli and Fuyang, production of CH4 from Suwan soil was only
observed when straw was added (data not shown). However, the
maximum rates of CH4 production were in a similar range (140–
−1 dry soil) in all three soils, irrespectively which
200 nmol h
type of straw was added. Addition of methyl ﬂuoride (1–2%) par-
tially inhibited CH4 production in all incubations (Figure 1).
The pH values during methanogenesis were between pH 6.8
and 7.1.

−1 g

Acetate transiently accumulated in all incubations indicating
that it was produced during degradation of organic matter (straw)
and consumed by methanogenesis (Figure 2). The maximum
amount of acetate accumulated accounted for about 30–50% of
CH4 produced until the end of the incubation (a concentration
−1 dry
of 1 mM acetate corresponds to an amount of 1 μmol g
soil). Addition of CH3F resulted in inhibition of acetate con-
sumption so that acetate concentrations stayed high until the end
of incubation (Figure 2). Only in Vercelli soil, acetate steadily
decreased after 300 h of incubation, probably since Vercelli soil was
only treated with 1% CH3F, whereas the other soils were treated

with 2% CH3F. Since CH3F concentrations usually decrease slowly
during incubation (Conrad and Klose, 1999b; Penning and Con-
rad, 2006), the CH3F concentrations in Vercelli soil probably
fell below the critical inhibitory threshold of 1% so that acetate
could again be consumed by methanogens (Penning et al., 2006b).
Increase of acetate (Fuyang) and/or decrease of acetate (Vercelli,
Suwan) was generally faster with maize straw than with rice straw
(Figure 2), being probably a reason for why CH4 production
was also somewhat faster with maize straw than with rice straw
(Figure 1).

Hydrogen, which is next to acetate another important substrate
for methanogenesis, also accumulated transiently (Figure 3). As
previously reported (Conrad, 2002) the highest H2 concentra-
tions were reached during the initial lag phase of CH4 production.
During the main phase of CH4 production H2 partial pressures
were generally lower than 50 Pa. In Vercelli and Fuyang soil,
but not in Suwan soil, H2 partial pressures seemed to be gen-
erally about 2 Pa higher with rice straw than with maize straw
(Figure 3).

The δ13C of the produced CH4 was generally higher for the soils
amended with maize straw than with rice straw and was generally
lower in the treatments with CH3F than in the untreated controls

(Figure 4). The δ13C of the produced acetate was also generally
higher for the soils amended with maize straw than with rice straw,
and increased faster with time in the absence than in the presence
of CH3F (Figure 5). This behavior is reasonable, since δ13C of the
residual acetate should increase because of carbon isotope frac-
tionation during acetate consumption (cf. Penning and Conrad,
2007).

Note that δ13C of acetate-methyl is given in Figure 5. The data
were directly measured in the incubations of Vercelli and Fuyang
soil. The δ13C of acetate-methyl was about 10‰ lower than that
of total acetate (Figure 6). For Suwan soil, we only analyzed the
δ13C of total acetate. The corresponding values of acetate-methyl
shown in Figure 5 were calculated by subtracting 10‰ from the
δ13C of total acetate.

The fractionation factors (αCO2,CH4) for hydrogenotrophic
methanogenesis (calculated by Eq. 3) were in a range of 1.045–
1.060, 1.050–1.060, and 1.040–1.055 for soils from Vercelli, Fuyang,
and Suwan, respectively. In general, values were by about 0.005–
0.010 units higher in soil amended with rice straw than with maize
straw (data not shown).

The percentage contribution of hydrogenotrophic methano-
genesis to total CH4 production was calculated (using Eq. 4)

estingly, the pattern was very similar for treatments with maize
straw versus rice straw.

METHANOGENIC ARCHAEA
The abundance of methanogenic archaea in the authentic rice
ﬁeld soils from Vercelli and Fuyang was quantiﬁed before and
after incubation with straw using qPCR and T-RFLP targeting
archaeal 16S rRNA genes. The T-RFs detected could be afﬁli-
ated to different methanogenic groups based on previous studies
using T-RFLP and cloning/sequencing of archaeal genes (Chin
et al., 1999; Lueders and Friedrich, 2000; Peng et al., 2008; Wu
et al., 2009). The following T-RFs (in brackets) could be afﬁl-
iated: Methanomicrobiales (84 bp), Methanobacteriales (92 bp),
Methanosarcinaceae (186 bp), Methanosaetaceae (284 bp), and
Methanocellales (393 bp). The T-RFs of 74, 381, >738 bp were
only detected in low relative abundance (<2%), and thus were
not further considered. In Vercelli and Fuyang soil the T-
RF= 186 bp represents mainly Methanosarcinaceae. Although
this T-RF can also represent non-methanogenic crenarchaeotes
(Rice cluster VI or group I.1b), they generally constitute only

a minor fraction of T-RF= 186 bp in rice ﬁeld soil and can be
neglected.

Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns
of archaeal 16S rRNA genes slightly changed during incubation
with rice and maize straw in both Vercelli and Fuyang soil with
the relative abundance of the 186 bp peak increasing during the
phase of active acetate consumption (data not shown). Similar pat-
terns have been observed before and were interpreted as growth of
acetoclastic Methanosarcina spp. (Conrad and Klose, 2006; Peng
et al., 2008). In both Vercelli (Figure 8) and Fuyang (Figure 9) soil
the numbers of total archaea signiﬁcantly increased after incu-
bation with straw, more in Vercelli than in Fuyang, and more
with maize straw than with rice straw. The proliferating archaeal
community in Vercelli soil consisted mainly of Methanosarci-
naceae and Methanobacteriales, while Methanocellales were much
less abundant (Figure 8). In Fuyang soil, on the other hand,
Methanosarcinaceae and Methanocellales were the most abundant
methanogens, but Methanobacteriales were also of relatively large
importance (Figure 9). Addition of CH3F inhibited the prolifera-
tion of the methanogenic populations in Vercelli and Fuyang soil
(Figures 8 and 9).

The soil from Suwan had previously not been used for culti-
vating rice. Although archaea were abundant, the T-RFLP pattern
was almost exclusively dominated by the 186 bp T-RF. In contrast
to Vercelli and Fuyang soil, the abundance of total archaea did
not increase upon incubation with straw (Figure 10). Sequenc-
ing of six clones of archaeal 16S rRNA genes generally resulted
in assignment to crenarchaeotes (accession numbers: JQ286402–
JQ286407). We therefore assumed that the archaeal 16S rRNA in
this soil was mainly represented by crenarchaeotes, whose abun-
dance was not enhanced by addition of straw. We therefore decided
to quantify methanogens directly by applying qPCR assays tar-
geting the mcrA gene that is unique to methanogens. Using this
assay, a signiﬁcant proliferation of methanogens by two orders
of magnitude was detected after incubation with straw reaching
almost the abundance of total archaeal 16S rRNA gene copies
(Figure 10). The methanogenic community consisted almost
equally of Methanosarcinaceae and Methanocellales, with Metha-
nomicrobiales as only minor additional component (Figure 10).
Proliferation of Methanosarcinaceae and total methanogens was
slightly inhibited by the presence of CH3F (Figure 10).

DISCUSSION
Our study showed differences in the temporal patterns and rates
of CH4 production, and of the transient production of the

methanogenic precursors acetate and H2 especially across the dif-
ferent soils but also between the treatments with maize straw
versus rice straw. Similarly, the composition and dynamics of the
methanogenic populations were quite different in the different
soils. Finally, substantial differences were found in the isotopic
signatures of CH4 and acetate-methyl between maize straw and
rice straw treatments, basically since the organic matter serving
as substrate for methanogenic degradation had different isotopic
signatures (C4 versus C3 plant). However, despite all these differ-
ences, CH4 production from both maize straw versus rice straw
followed similar pathways, which were also quite similar for the
different soils.

METHANOGENIC PATHWAY
Hence, the differences were all in details of the methanogenic
degradation process and the active methanogenic populations,
while the overall methanogenic path was very similar. This demon-
strates an amazing constancy in system functioning despite all the
differences in substrate quality (mainly based on straw type) and
archaeal community composition and abundance (mainly based
on soil type). We had previously observed a similar constancy in
methanogenic paths in soils vegetated with cultivated rice versus
wild rice, although differences in turnover rates existed (Conrad
et al., 2009). However, these soils had a similar archaeal community

composition. On the other hand, we have observed dramatic dif-
ferences in CH4 production and emission when rice was grown
on different soils, and roots were colonized with crossly different
methanogenic populations (Conrad et al., 2008). Therefore, we
do not generally exclude that the archaeal methanogenic commu-
nity composition and abundance might have a substantial effect
on methanogenic functioning. In the present study, however, the
methanogenic functioning was generally similar.

In general, CH4 production was at ﬁrst dominated by
hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis which subsequently decreased
as acetoclastic methanogenesis became progressively more impor-
tant, and ﬁnally increased again. This temporal pattern was par-
alleled by the initial peak in H2 accumulation, followed by the
slower transient accumulation of acetate, which was eventually
depleted to rather low concentrations characteristic for steady
state between fermentative production and methanogenic con-
sumption of acetate. Similar temporal patterns of the relative
contribution of hydrogenotrophic versus acetoclastic methano-
genesis have been observed before (Conrad et al., 2002; Fey et al.,
2004; Penning and Conrad, 2007). Such temporal pattern has
been explained by a conceptual model based on the sequential
degradation of organic matter by hydrolytic fermentative, and
methanogenic microbes, by the competition of sulfate-reducing

and iron-reducing bacteria for H2 and by the relatively late activa-
tion of acetoclastic methanogens (Conrad, 2002; Glissmann and
Conrad, 2002).

METHANOGENIC ARCHAEA
Incubation of maize straw or rice straw under methanogenic
conditions generally resulted in increase of total methanogenic
archaea irrespectively of the soil used. In the Vercelli and Fuyang
soils, the archaeal 16S rRNA genes almost exclusively belonged to
methanogens and copy numbers were relatively abundant (106–
−1 dry soil) right from the beginning of incubation, as
108 g
expected for authentic rice ﬁeld soils (Krüger et al., 2005; Ma
et al., 2010). In the Suwan soil by contrast, copy numbers were
−1 dry soil), which is normal for
in the beginning rather low (103 g
upland soil (Angel et al., 2012). In all of the soils, however, num-
bers of methanogens eventually increased during methanogenic
degradation of straw. The most abundant methanogens always
belonged to the family of Methanosarcinaceae, presumably since
acetoclastic Methanosarcina species proliferated by consuming the
transiently accumulated acetate. Such proliferation during degra-
dation of straw has been observed before and the ﬁnal abundance
was found to be consistent with theoretical calculations based on
the energetic conditions in the soil for acetate conversion to CH4

(Conrad and Klose, 2006; Angel et al., 2012). The most abundant
hydrogenotrophic methanogens were Methanobacteriales in Ver-
celli soil, and Methanocellales in the other two soils. The results
on Vercelli (Weber et al., 2001; Conrad and Klose, 2006) and
Fuyang (Peng et al., 2008) soil is consistent with previous obser-
vations. Suwan soil had not been ﬂooded before and thus initially
contained only a low abundance of methanogens. In the end,
however, Methanosarcinaceae and Methanocellales dominated. In
other upland soils these two methanogenic groups were also found
to be the most prevalent ones, both before ﬁrst ﬂooding and after
an extensive phase of methanogenesis (Angel et al., 2012). These
two methanogenic groups are in particular known for potentially
being able to deal with toxic O2 species and surviving oxic soil
conditions (Erkel et al., 2006; Angel et al., 2011).

Addition of CH3F generally resulted in substantial inhibition of
CH4 production, irrespectively of the type of soil or straw. As CH3F
is known as speciﬁc inhibitor of acetoclastic methanogens (Janssen
and Frenzel, 1997), one would expect that acetate consumption by
this group of methanogens is inhibited. Thus, members of the
Methanosarcinaceae should be impeded in growth unless they
use an alternative energy source such as CH4 production from
H2/CO2. A previous study using methanogenic rice roots has
indeed shown that growth of acetoclastic Methanosarcinaceae was

inhibited by CH3F (Penning and Conrad, 2006). In the present
study using Vercelli soil addition of CH3F also signiﬁcantly inhib-
ited the growth of the potentially acetoclastic Methanosarcinaceae,
but it also inhibited growth of non-acetoclastic Methanobacteri-
ales. The same was observed in Fuyang soil amended with maize
straw, while the methanogenic population in the rice straw treat-
ments were not signiﬁcantly inhibited at all. In Suwan soil, on the
other hand, again only the growth of Methansarcinaceae but not
of Methanocellales was inhibited by CH3F. Although we have no
ﬁnal explanation for the different behavior, we assume that it is due
to the fact that Methanosarcina species are not restricted to aceto-
clastic methanogenic metabolism, and may have used for example
H2/CO2 for growth in the presence of CH3F, and that growth
of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was unspeciﬁcally inhibited
(Conrad and Klose, 1999b).

STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION
Due to inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis addition of
CH3F inhibited or delayed the consumption of the accumu-
lated acetate and resulted in lower δ13C of the produced CH4.
The δ13C of
the CH4 produced in the presence of CH3F
should represent the δ13C of hydrogenotrophically produced CH4
(δ13CCH4−mc). Since the fractionation factor for hydrogenotrophic

www.frontiersin.org

Conrad et al.

Methanogenesis in rice ﬁeld soil

methanogenesis is larger than for acetoclastic methanogenesis
(Conrad, 2005), δ13CCH4−mc is expected of being lower than
the δ13C of total CH4 or of acetoclastically produced CH4
(δ13CCH4−ma), which was actually observed. The fractionation
factors of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis that were calcu-
lated from the values of δ13CCH4−mc (Eq. 3) were in a range
= 1.04 − 1.06, which have quite commonly
of αCO2,CH4
been observed in rice ﬁeld soils (Sugimoto and Wada, 1993;
Chidthaisong et al., 2002; Penning and Conrad, 2007; Conrad
et al., 2009). The same range of αCO2, CH4 has been used for cal-
culation of (fH2) of total CH4 produced from CO2 reduction (Eq.
4) during studies on rice ﬁelds in TX, USA (Bilek et al., 1999) and
Italy (Krüger et al., 2002). If acetoclastic methanogenesis is not
completely inhibited (which might have been the case in Vercelli
and Fuyang soil, but not in Suwan soil), δ13CCH4−mc would be
less negative than expected and values of fH2 would be overesti-
mated (sensitivity analysis see Conrad et al., 2002). However, the
range of fH2 values was similar in soil from Suwan (25–80%) as in
soils from Vercelli (15–75%) and Fuyang (25–100%). Neverthe-
less, it should be noted that the fH2 values that were ﬁnally reached
were relatively high (50–70%) compared to a value of 33% that is
expected when carbohydrates are methanogenically decomposed
under steady state conditions (Conrad, 1999).

= 1.015 (equivalent to εac - methyl,CH4

Computation of fH2 is also affected by the value of δ13CCH4−ma,
which was based on measured values of δ13C of acetate-methyl and
the assumption of a fractionation factor for acetoclastic methano-
=
genesis of αac - methyl,CH4
−15‰). Such value is reasonable because acetoclastic methano-
genesis was apparently dominated by Methanosarcina. In soil,
Methanosarcina species exhibit εac - methyl,CH4 values that are about
5–10‰ less negative than in pure culture which is probably due
to limitation by acetate (Penning and Conrad, 2007; Goevert and
Conrad, 2009). In systems dominated by Methanosaeta species,
values of εac - methyl,CH4 are even less negative, i.e., on the order
of >−10‰ (Valentine et al., 2004; Penning et al., 2006a), and
fractionation may become actually zero in systems where acetate
supply is so low that it is quantitatively utilized as it is produced.

Calculation of fH2 results in increasing values with αac - methyl,CH4
becoming smaller (equivalent to εac - methyl,CH4 becoming less neg-
ative). However, we may assume that this was not the case in our
experiments, which generally showed acetate concentrations well
above 100 μM.

Taking all these uncertainties into account it is striking that
amendment with either maize straw or rice straw had a similar
effect on the overall value of fH2 and its temporal change. Hence,
amendment of soil with maize straw may be used for experiments
in which the partitioning of CH4 production derived from root
versus straw decomposition is determined. Such determinations
are even feasible under ﬁeld conditions by measuring the δ13C
in the total CH4 produced by comparing ﬁelds amended with
either rice straw or maize straw. We are presently about doing
such studies.

CONCLUSION
The present study showed that despite the involvement of dif-
ferent methanogenic populations in the different soils, pathways
and temporal patterns of CH4 production were nearly identi-
cal between straw treatments. Hence, the temporal patterns and
paths of CH4 production were mostly dependent on the soil
and not on the straw. Our study also demonstrates a surpris-
ing constancy of system functioning, despite the qualitative and
quantitative differences in soil methanogenic populations, includ-
ing those from a previous upland soil, and differences in straw
quality. The observed constancy indicates ﬂexible adaptation of
the different microbial communities in order to achieve similar
methanogenic degradation of straw.
