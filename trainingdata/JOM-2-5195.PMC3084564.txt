Inflammation caused by infections may be the most important preventable cause of cancer in general.
However, in the oral cavity the role of microbiota in carcinogenesis is not known. Microbial populations on
mouth mucosa differ between healthy and malignant sites and certain oral bacterial species have been linked
with malignancies but the evidence is still weak in this respect. Nevertheless, oral microorganisms inevitably
up-regulate cytokines and other inflammatory mediators that affect the complex metabolic pathways and
may thus be involved in carcinogenesis. Poor oral health associates statistically with prevalence of many types
of cancer, such as pancreatic and gastrointestinal cancer. Furthermore, several oral micro-organisms are
capable of converting alcohol to carcinogenic acetaldehyde which also may partly explain the known
association between heavy drinking, smoking, poor oral health and the prevalence of oral and upper
gastrointestinal cancer. A different problem is the cancer treatment-caused alterations in oral microbiota
which may lead to the emergence of potential pathogens and subsequent other systemic health problems to
the patients. Hence clinical guidelines and recommendations have been presented to control oral microbiota
in patients with malignant disease, but also in this area the scientific evidence is weak. More controlled studies
are needed for further conclusion.

Human microbiota may play a role in carcinogen-

esis. Helicobacter pylori
the best known
bacterium causally linked with cancer (1). How-
ever, the general concept of human microbiota is chan-
ging when molecular techniques have revealed its vast
diversity, but, at the same time, individual stability of
micro-organisms residing on skin and gastrointestinal
tract mucosa (2). Micro-organisms seem to play an
important role in metabolism but it is not known how
the diversity relates to function and to the rest of the
genes in the collective genomes of
the microbiota.
Extensive studies have shown in the gut that its totality
of microbes, the microbiome, is shared among family
members, but
that each person’s microbial comm-
unity varies in the specific bacterial
lineages present,
with a comparable degree of co-variation. A wide array of
shared microbial genes have been observed among
sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable
‘core microbiome’ at the gene level rather than at the
organismal lineage (3). Corresponding studies on oral
microbiota are on their way (4).

Traditionally it has been thought that mouth mucosa
(5), the tongue (6), and the pharynx (7) harbor char-
acteristic bacterial pathogens causing chronic inflamma-
tion and focal infections (8). Many of these infections
derive from oral biofilms commonly linked with the

highly prevalent dental diseases (911). For a long time,
particularly periodontal disease has been emphasized in
this respect (12). Oral microbiota may also associate
with the development of cancer. It is a well-known
clinical fact that the patients with oral cancer often
present with poor oral hygiene. Studies have shown that
the association between oral microorganisms and cancer
may even be causal (13).

Inflammation is a key feature in many chronic diseases
including cancer (14, 15). Investigations of gastrointest-
inal malignancies have shown that the large amount of
cytokines and growth factors released during inflamma-
tion by immune and non-immune cells may influence
carcinogenesis (16). In general, infection-driven inflam-
mations have been estimated to be involved in the
pathogenesis of approximately 1520% of human tumors
(17). Hence inflammation caused by infections might
be one of the most important preventable causes of
cancer (18).

The worldwide incidence of cancer also attributes to
infections caused by virus such as hepatitis viruses,
human papilloma virus (HPV), and Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) (19, 20). Characteristic to infections and inflam-
mations linked with malignancies is indeed that they are
persistent in the host for a long time and highly prevalent
in populations (21). However, there may be a long latency

between the initial infection and tumor appearance, and
not at all does every infected person develop cancer. In
general this area is difficult for research. The overall
effect of the microbiome in these contexts is not known.
This review briefly outlines current knowledge about
the role of oral microbiota in carcinogenesis with
emphasis on oral cancer and microbial changes caused
by cancer treatment. The focus is on bacterial and yeast
infections and the reader interested in viral infections is
advised to other texts. To put the viral
infections in
perspective, however, it has been estimated that at least
six human viruses, EBV, hepatitis B virus (HBV),
hepatitis C virus (HCV), HPV, human T-cell lympho-
tropic virus (HTLV-1) and Kaposi’s associated sarcoma
virus (KSHV) contribute to 1015% of
the cancers
worldwide (22). No such figures exist for bacteria- or
yeast-related malignancies. The role of viruses has
recently been reviewed in this journal (23).

The current text is based on the PubMed literature
searching 20 years back and up to the end of May 2010.
The keywords used were ‘cancer’ vs. ‘oral microbiota’ (20
hits), ‘dental hygiene’ (981 hits), ‘oral micro-organisms’
(136 hits); and ‘carcinogenesis’ vs. ‘oral infection’ (153
hits), and ‘oral
infection control’ (37 hits). Based on
relevance of the abstracts of the publications full texts
were then searched and assessed for final
inclusion.
Because of scarcity of hard data and the descriptive
nature of the majority of studies no systematic review
could be conducted.

Oral health effects on cancer
The association between poor oral health and tooth loss
with increased risk of gastric cancer has been reported in
retrospective studies in many countries (2426). Further-
more, in a prospective study from China, Abnet and co-
workers (27) reported that tooth loss increased the risk of
developing gastrointestinal cancer. Positive associations
between tooth loss and pancreatic cancer have also been
reported (28, 29). A prospective cohort study in the US
male health professionals showed that when compared
with no periodontal disease, the history of periodontitis
significantly associated with increased pancreatic cancer
risk [risk ratio (RR) 1.64; 95% confidence interval (CI)
1.192.26] while the cumulative tooth loss during the
16-year follow-up was not associated with pancreatic
cancer (30). There are also anecdotal data to show that
oral streptococci may associate with colonic cancer (31).
These data, however, rather present systemic compli-
cations of the patients than give any evidence for causal
effect (32).

In the male health professionals study from the USA,
periodontal disease has also been shown to increase the
statistical risk for head and neck cancer with an odds
ratio (OR) 4.36 (CI 6.0193.16). The association persisted
in subjects who never used alcohol or tobacco (33).

Furthermore, a study from Buffalo, New York, on 51
cases with tongue cancer, showed that chronic period-
ontitis presented a 5.23-fold increase in the cancer risk
when compared with 54 controls (OR 5.23; CI 2.64
10.35) (34). The same group reported that periodontitis
patients were also more likely to have poorly differen-
tiated oral squamous cell carcinomas than periodontally
healthy patients (35). Interestingly, practicing no regular
oral hygiene also conferred OR 2.37 (CI 1.423.97) for
esophageal cancer when compared with those who
undertook daily tooth brushing (36). Recently, in a study
on 30,475 individuals also from the USA, the use of
dental care was analyzed with respect to oral cancer.
After controlling relevant covariates the results showed
that when compared with no use of dental care those who
had had dental appointments during the past 12 months
were 62% less likely to have oral cancer (OR 0.38,
CI 0.131.10) (37).

Mucocutaneous candidiasis is also known to associate
with the development of cancer in particular patients
with a rare genetic disease called autoimmune poly-
endocrinopathycandidiasisectodermal dystrophy (38).
These patients call for frequent follow-up due to mark-
edly increased oral cancer risk with subsequent malig-
nancies presenting in young age of the patients. Recently,
however, cases have been presented where chronic muco-
cutaneous Candida infection associated with esophageal
cancer in patients with immunoglobulin-A deficiency
it can be speculated that impaired local
(39). Thus,
immunity which renders the patient
liable for oral
candidiasis increases the risk for cancer. More studies
are needed for further evidence, however.

Our unpublished results from a cohort study in Sweden
with 16 years of follow-up showed that age, female
gender, and periodontitis with loss of the first mandibular
molars were the principal
independent predictors of
cancers in general, and breast cancer in particular, as
registered in the Swedish Cancer Registry. From the same
database, premature death of young individuals was
observed to link statistically with periodontitis and
missing molars whether the cause of death was because
of cancer, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal disease (40).
A confounding factor difficult to control in epidemio-
logical studies, however,
is the fact that oral health-
related variables also link with the use of tobacco and
alcohol (41). Furthermore, there are no studies conducted
to show if aggressive forms of oral infections affect the
incidence or prevalence of cancer compared with milder
forms of infections (42). Hence there is a need for further
studies in which also the severity of oral infection is taken
into account together with encompassing all possible foci
of infections and not only periodontitis. However, it is of
interest to emphasize that in many studies the associa-
tions between periodontal disease and cancer, in parti-
cular, persisted after adjustment for major risk factors,

including cigarette smoking and socioeconomic status
(43). Thus, taken together the results from studies in this
area seem to support the general hypothesis of chronic
oral infection-based carcinogenesis (44).

Mechanisms involved in oral infection-linked
carcinogenesis
In general, the association between periodontal disease
and various systemic diseases has been intensively studied
during the past two decades, but the exact mechanisms
involved are still not known. Most studies have focused
on the development of atherosclerosis; periodontal micro-
organisms have been detected in atheroma plaques (45).
The large potential wound area of inflamed periodontium
in dentate subjects, the rich oral microbiota and the
frequent transient bacteremia episodes in normal
life,
maintain a low-grade chronic inflammation which trig-
gers a variety of systemic reactions. These in turn may
lead to carcinogenic mechanisms which, however, are not
clear. Irrespective of the focus of infection bacteria may
induce cellular proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, interfere
with cellular signaling mechanisms, and act as tumor
promoters (46).

Up-regulation of cytokines and other inflammatory
mediators affect complex metabolic pathways and there
also seems to be a link between chronic infections and
sugar metabolism. For example, the receptor for ad-
vanced glycation end products (RAGE), a multi-ligand
receptor expressed on various cell membranes, has been
suggested to play a role also in carcinogenesis. RAGE is
activated by ligands in a variety of cell types and tissues,
and may play a role in the oral infection-systemic health
associations (47). This receptor is associated with pro-
inflammatory responses and may underlie in diverse
pathologies including periodontal disease (48). Oral
infection may also directly reflect in endothelial dys-
function with systemic consequences (49). The cytokine
reactions involved have been shown to play a role in the
immune-related mechanisms of cancer development (50).
Another mechanism suggested to be involved in oral
carcinogenesis is mediated via salivary factors. Poor oral
health has been shown to associate with the genotoxic
salivary activity. Bloching et al. (51) studied dental status
and saliva of 100 subjects relating their oral health to
in vitro salivary mutagenicity, using the Salmonella test.
The authors reported a significant association ( pB0.05)
between high-plaque index and high number of carious
teeth with the genotoxic activity in saliva. Studies on this
field indicate, however, that salivary mutagenicity is the
result of external chemicals and carcinogens introduced
into the system. Thus, for example, the use of tobacco
and areca nuts associates with the development of oral
(52). The polymicrobial burden caused by
cancer
oral biofilms may also possess mutagenic
inter-
actions with saliva which may act as co-factors in

Oral microbiota and cancer

carcinogenesis. These examples illustrate the complexity
of tumor genesis.

Recently, a possible causal link between micro-organ-
isms and oral cancer has been suggested. Several bacteria
and Candida strains in the mouth convert ethanol to
carcinogenic acetaldehyde thus explaining the epidemio-
logical evidence between heavy drinking, smoking, and
development of cancer (53, 54). Both the commonly
encountered oral streptococci and yeasts possess meta-
bolic pathways for this conversion (5557). Alcohol-
related carcinogenesis is well-known and the enzymes
involved have been characterized. Polymorphism in these
genes may partly explain why subjects differ in their
liability for the development of cancer;
it may be a
question of higher or lower metabolic activities involved
in alcohol metabolism (58). Nevertheless, there is a
significant doseresponse relationship between alcohol
intake frequency, duration of use, and oral cancer risk
(59). Similarly, smoking associates with cancer and
smoking also causes an increase in salivary acetaldehyde
concentrations thus adding to the risk related to alco-
hol (60). The effect of smoking and alcohol
is thus
synergistic (61).

Differences in oral microbiota in patients with
and without cancer
Microbial populations on mouth mucosa seem to differ
between healthy and malignant sites. For example,
Streptococcus anginosus and Treponema denticola associ-
ate with various upper gastrointestinal tract carcinomas
(62). Shiga et al. (63) suggested that S. anginosus infection
might be implicated in the carcinogenesis of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma in general. S. anginosus
DNA has been detected in carcinoma tissue samples but
not in lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or leukoplakia
samples. Dental plaque could be a dominant reservoir of
this bacterium (64). As a curiosity, syphilis has also been
mentioned in textbooks to be associated with cancer, but
there are no data found to support this statement.

Mager et al. (65) investigated the relationship of 40
common salivary bacteria counts between 45 patients
with oral cancer compared with counts from 229 healthy
controls. They observed that Capnocytophaga gingivalis,
Prevotella melaninogenica, and Streptococcus mitis counts
were significantly increased among the oral cancer
patients. The authors further analyzed if these species
could be used as diagnostic markers for oral cancer and
found 80% sensitivity and 82% specificity, respectively.
In oral cancer patients mutated salivary DNA at the
53p gene was observed in 62.5% of 10 patients when
compared with 18.5% among 27 healthy controls in a
study from Taiwan (66). In another study salivary
mitochondrial DNA was found to be increased in patients
with head and neck cancer directly in proportion to the
degree of malignancy of the tissue, i.e. from mild to severe

dysplasia (67). Again, however, further studies are needed
to confirm these findings.

Several researchers have observed viral or pro-viral
DNA in saliva or gingival crevicular fluid samples of
patients with malignancies (68, 69). These and other
biomarkers of oral cancer have been recently reviewed by
Seoane Lesto´ n and Diz Dios (70) and Wu et al. (71). In
the future laboratory methods
such as microarray
analyses and gene expression profiling might be applic-
able for investigating changes in oral microbiota on
malignant sites. For example, pyrosequencing of the
oral cavity and salivary samples has greatly improved
our understanding in the wider perspective of
the
complex microbiota of the mouth (72).

In general, novel approaches to map oral cancer lesions
are based on molecular techniques (73, 74). It has been
shown that genes express differently on malignant vs.
healthy sites and that more accurately than conventional
histology certain gene profiles can be used to assess the
disease course. It remains to be shown how specifically
these changes possibly affect oral microbiota, however.
Further, studies are called for to investigate whether
combined molecular techniques such as genomics, tran-
scriptomics, and proteomics could be used to profile
both the host tissue and the microbiota for accurate
diagnostics (75).

Finally,

in mind that

it should also be kept

the
sampling site as such may influence the results. In oral
cancer patients optimal sampling may be difficult (76).
Consequently, proper sampling technique for both the
conventional cultivation and the new molecular methods
needs to be emphasized (77). There is a need for
standardized guidelines in this area.

Effect of cancer treatment on oral microbiota
Microbiological studies have been conducted in particu-
lar in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. Radio-
therapy-caused hyposalivation may affect
the oral
microbiota. Variations
in quantity, complexity, and
quality of the oral microbiota also occur during che-
motherapy, leading to a major imbalance of the ecosys-
tem (78). For example, in a study from Sweden, Candida
albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the
subjects who had received radiotherapy to the head and
neck in comparison to 15% of the controls. These patients
also harbored enterococci in 38% vs. none of the controls.
Lactobacillus spp. were detected in 92% of the subjects
and the proportion of the species was high compared with
the controls. Mutants streptococci were also detected
in high numbers; 31% in the patients vs. 23% in con-
trols (79). On the other hand, in a study from China
mutants streptococci were not isolated in radiotherapy
patients while lactobacilli, S. mitis and S. salivarius were
the predominant caries-related oral bacteria following
radiotherapy (80).

Bacteria in gingival pockets in head- and neck-
irradiated patients have also been investigated. A com-
prehensive study from Hong Kong showed that the
major components of sub-gingival microbiota appear
similar to that of gingivitis sites in the normal population
although among the radiotherapy patients bacterial or
fungal species uncommon in normal subjects were also
detected (81). These species included micro-organisms
such as Gemella, Peptostreptococcus, Staphylococcus,
Stomatococcus, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Eubacterium,
Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Neisseria, Veillonella,
Bacteroides, Campylobacter, Capnocytophaga, Fusobac-
terium, Kingella, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella. Also
species of microbes that are characteristic to the normal
skin (Peptostreptococcus prevotii and
microbiota of
Propionibacterium granulosum) and gut
(Eubacterium
aerofaciens, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacter-
ium varium) were detected in this material (81).

How permanent are the shifts in oral microbiota after
the treatment of cancer is another question of interest.
Radiotherapy or cytostatic treatment-caused changes in
bacterial composition need not be permanent. For
example, in child allogenic bone marrow transplantation
patients in the UK no differences were seen in the total
anaerobic counts or in the proportion of the S. oralis
group bacteria between the baseline and end of a 119-day
study or between the patients and controls (82). However,
caries risk may still be increased in particular in pediatric
patients surviving a malignant disease (83).

In immunosuppressed patients treated with cytostatic
drugs pathogenic and opportunistic micro-organisms
colonizing the mouth may indeed be dangerous. Enter-
obacteria and genera such as Pseudomonas, Neisseria, and
Veillonella have been observed in oral samples from
granulocytopenic patients with leukemia (84). Yeasts
can also be predominant but not always (85). It appears
that the pre-treatment oral health status is important in
this respect. For example, in a study on non-lymphocytic
leukemia patients in Baltimore periodontal disease status
and attachment
loss were positively correlated with
increase in the proportional recovery of Staphylococcus
spp. from supra-gingival sites and total yeasts from
supra- and sub-gingival sites (86). The authors suggested
that host
factors such as periodontal disease may
contribute to the patterns of oral microbial successions
during cancer chemotherapy. Finally, pathogens such as
Capnocytophaga may pose a systemic risk in patients with
cancer. Hence continuous attention is called for in order
to prevent bacteremia and also to overcome problems of
developing antibiotic resistance as pointed out by Sixou
et al. (87). Above all, however, studies are lacking to show
how different cancer treatments affect oral microbiota as
a whole. It can be anticipated that all the oral cancer
treatment modes,
include surgery, radiotherapy, and
cytostatic drugs, affect oral micro-organisms differently

with possible characteristic shifts in biofilm composition.
Hence more studies are needed in this area which is
important in order to get evidence-based guidelines to the
maintaining satisfactory dental health of an individual
with cancer (88). These are briefly discussed below.

Controlling oral microbiota in cancer patients
Potential oral infection foci need to be diagnosed and
treated before starting immunosuppressive therapy (89).
To avoid complications antiseptic oral rinses have been
recommended. Chlorhexidine has been the golden stan-
dard in controlling oral microbiota in cancer patients.
Oncologic units and wards have guidelines explaining
how and at what phase of the treatment the mouthwashes
should be administered to the patients. Chlorhexidine in
general has shown effective in preventing dentogenic
bacteremia. For example, in a study by Toma´s et al. (90),
the prevalence of bacteremia after dental extraction by
using chlorhexidine and control groups were 79% vs.
96%, respectively, at 30 s ( pB0.01), 30% vs. 64% at 15
min ( pB0.001), and 2% vs. 20% at 1 h ( pB0.01) after
the treatment. In their study the most frequently identi-
fied bacteria were Streptococcus spp., particularly of the
viridans group. These were detected from blood cultures
of both the chlorhexidine and control groups (64% and
68% of the subjects, respectively).

Chlorhexidine mouthwash has also shown effective in
preventing oral mucocitis during cancer chemotherapy. In
a randomized double-blind study on 206 patients receiv-
ing fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in gastrointestinal
cancer mucositis occurred more frequently (33%) if the
patients did not receive chlorhexidine in comparison to
the study phase when three daily chlorhexidine mouth
rinses were administered (13%, pB0.01) (91). Similarly in
a study on head and neck cancer patients undergoing
radiotherapy using either 0.12% chlorhexidine or 1%
povidoneiodine mouthwash was efficient in reducing
oral mucositis episodes when compared with saline or
soda rinses (92).

However, scientific evidence for the practise of recom-
mending chlorhexidine (or any other chemical) during
cancer treatment is weak and the results are partly
controversial. For example,
in a study on leukemia
patients one group rinsed with a 0.2% of chlorhexidine
solution twice daily while the other group did not. The
results showed that chlorhexidine had no significant
effect on any clinical parameters such as the number of
days with fever, number of oral lesions, plaque score,
gingival bleeding score, or the occurrence of candidiasis
(93). Recently, Antunes et al. (94) confirmed in their
study on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients
that using extra soft toothbrush and toothpaste was
enough during immunsuppression to prevent systemic
spread of alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus viridans and C.
albicans. Using 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinse thrice

daily in addition to the mechanical cleaning did not add
anything in preventing streptococcal bacteremia (94).
Nevertheless chlorhexidine has been routinely used since
the early 1970s when, for example, oral application of
0.2% chlorhexidine was found to reduce the suffering of
leukemic children and prevented spread of thrush from
the oral cavity (95).

Other chemicals except chlorhexidine may, however,
also have some value in controlling oral bacteria during
cancer chemotherapy. A 1-year randomized trial from
our clinic on 79 Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
patients
showed that using mouthwash containing
0.025% amine fluoridestannousfluoride caused a sig-
nificant decrease in visible plaque, gingival bleeding, and
salivary S. mutans counts while an increase was found in
the group using 0.05% sodium fluoride rinses (96).
However, also in this study a short-term use of 0.12%
chlorhexidine at the induction phase of chemotherapy
was most efficient in reducing dental plaque scores in
both the fluoride-rinsing groups (97).

In a meta-analysis, Stokman et al. (98) concluded that
of the several chemicals reported in controlled trials for
preventing oral mucositis the combined use of polymyxin
E, tobramycine, and amphotericin B showed an OR 0.61
(CI 0.390.96) and amifostine OR 0.37 (CI 0.150.89).
The authors concluded that ‘to date, no single interven-
tion completely prevents oral mucositis, so combined
preventive therapy strategies seem to be required to
ensure more successful outcomes’. The important issue
of anticancer therapy-related oral mucositis has also
been recently assessed in the Cochrane collaboration.
The systematic review was based on trials meeting the
following
random allocation
of participants; participants were anyone with cancer
receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy;
interventions
with agents prescribed to prevent oral mucositis; and the
outcomes were prevention of mucositis, pain, amount of
analgesia, dysphagia, systemic infection, length of hospi-
talization, costs incurred, and patient quality-of-life. The
authors conclude their meta-analysis stating that ‘there is
a need for well-designed and -conducted trials with
sufficient numbers of participants to perform subgroup
analyses by type of disease and chemotherapeutic agent’
(99). There is nothing to add to this conclusion.

criteria: design was

In addition to preventing oral bacteremia complica-
tions due to the direct spread of micro-organisms is of
further concern among immunosuppressed and cancer
patients. For example, pneumonia may follow and the
risk increases if the level of oral hygiene is poor (100).
Akutsu et al. (101) observed that pathogens in preopera-
tive dental plaque are risk factors for postoperative
pneumonia in patients with esophageal cancer.

Taken into consideration the weak scientific evidence
and partly controversial results from studies investigating
the control of oral microbiota in cancer patients there

nevertheless is agreement that oral health care is im-
portant during and after the treatment of cancer. The
oral health care personnel are in a key position in
advising the patients (102). We have recently reviewed
this topic more thoroughly (88).

Prevention of oral microbiota-linked
carcinogenesis
If there is indeed a causal link between oral microbiota
and cancer then the ultimate goal would be to prevent the
development of cancer by interfering with the putative
carcinogenic potential of the microbiome. Intervention of
acetaldehyde-related carcinogenesis has been investigated
using cysteine (103, 104). This non-essential amino acid
binds effectively acetaldehyde by forming a stable
thiazolidinecarboxylic acid compound hence eliminating
the local carcinogenic effect (105107). Cysteine has also
been shown to exert inhibitory effect on the gelatinolytic
activity of matrix metalloproteinases and to reduce
metastases in animal models (108). Studies are now in
progress for assessing the local effect of orally adminis-
tered cysteine on oral microbiota in this perspective. In
general, this compound is widely available in a number of
dietary supplements.

Several other compounds have been introduced for the
prevention of oral cancer. The main target, however, has
been interfering with the cellular carcinogenic mechan-
isms rather than addressing oral microbiota. Neverthe-
less, many such compounds also exert antimicrobial
activity. These include retinoids
(109), anti-oxidant
vitamins E and A, and carotenoids (110, 111). However,
data are sparse on their effect
in preventing oral
carcinogenesis. Liede et al. (112, 113) could not show
any effect of beta-carotene on the prevalence of oral
mucosal lesions and buccal cell dysplasia in a controlled
57-year study in men in Finland.

Many naturally occurring spices and herbs have been
used from the early history of mankind in foods and to
treat ailments. These include spices such as garlic, cumin,
cloves, cinnamon, thyme, mustard, and rosemary, which
possess antimicrobial properties (114). Green tea has
been particularly investigated in this perspective (115).
The common nominators in many of these items are the
potent phytochemicals the plants contain; several com-
pounds have been tested in animal models (116). It is of
interest in this context to cite results from a recent study
from Japan where in women the hazard ratios of oral
cancer for green tea consumption of 12, 34, and 5 or
more cups per day were 0.51 (CI 0.102.68), 0.60 (CI
0.172.10), and 0.31 (CI 0.091.07), respectively, com-
pared with those who daily drank less than one cup of
green tea (p for trend was 0.08) (117). However, scientific
evidence is weak of the topic and more controlled long-
term studies are called for further conclusions. In the
future the development of anti-carcinogenic products

from naturally occurring compounds is fascinating but
certainly a big challenge.

Finally, during the past two decades probiotic or
health-beneficial bacteria have been re-introduced for
strengthening immune function. The early discovery in
the turn of the nineteenth century by Nobel laureate Ilya
Metchnikoff was long forgotten until the globally in-
creased antibiotic drug resistance problem and functional
food concept brought these bacteria again into daylight
(118, 119). It has been suggested that consuming of dairy
products with probiotic lactic acid bacteria may have
anti-tumor effects. The mechanisms involved are attrib-
uted to the inhibition of mutagenic activity, the decrease
in several enzymes implicated in the generation of
carcinogens, mutagens, or tumor-promoting agents, sup-
pression of tumors, adjuvant effects including modula-
tion of cell-mediated immune responses, activation of the
reticuloendothelial system, augmentation of cytokine
pathways, and regulation of
interleukins and tumor
necrosis factors (120). However, these findings are mainly
based on laboratory or animal studies. Evidence regard-
ing probiotic effect on human carcinogenesis is weak or
non-existent. These bacteria seem to have some effect on
preventing oral mucositis caused by treatment of cancer,
however (121). But there are no studies on the effect of
probiotics on oral cancer. It can be anticipated, however,
that the same mechanisms are involved here as in the
lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract. This certainly is
an area of interest in future studies.

Conclusion
Oral microbiota with its hundreds of microbial species
mainly residing in biofilms pose a threat to immunosup-
pressed cancer patients if microbes gain access to blood
circulation or spread locally to adjacent tissues. Therefore
a number of clinical guidelines and protocols have been
introduced to control oral
the
protocols are not evidence based, but rather derive from
long-time clinical practice. Since bacteremia complica-
tions are life-threatening to patients whose defense
systems are weakened obviously every effort should be
taken to prevent such complications. All cancer patients,
including patients with oral cancer, must
therefore
maintain satisfactory oral health which often calls for
regular professional treatment given by the oral health
care team. Another question is the role of oral microbiota
in carcinogenesis. Certain bacteria and yeasts may trigger
carcinogenic mechanisms at the cellular level. They may
also participate in metabolizing substances to carcino-
gens. An example to this is the microbial metabolism of
alcohol to carcinogenic acetaldehyde. Poor oral hygiene
has been associated with increased risk of oral cancer
where the known risk factors are heavy use of alcohol and
tobacco. Modern molecular methods are anticipated to
cast new light on the role of oral microbiome in

epidemiological studies have linked poor oral health with
overall prevalence of malignancies.
