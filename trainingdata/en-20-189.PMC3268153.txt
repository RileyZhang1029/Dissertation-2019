In this study, we characterize the hemodynamic changes in the main olfactory bulb of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with 
near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS, ISS Imagent) during presentation of two different odorants. Odorants were presented for 10 
seconds with clean air via an automatic odor stimulator. Odorants are: (i) plain air as a reference (Blank), (ii) 2-Heptanone (HEP), (iii) 
Isopropylbenzene (IB). Our results indicated that a plain air did not cause any change in the concentrations of oxygenated (Δ[HbO2]) 
and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Δ[Hbr]), but HEP and IB induced strong changes. Furthermore, these odor-specific changes had 
regional differences within the MOB. Our results suggest that NIRS technology might be a useful tool to identify of various odorants 
in a non-invasive manner using animals which has a superb olfactory system.

INTRODUCTION

An animal’s olfactory system is very important for finding food, 
mating and avoiding predators. These behaviors are initiated by 
detection and discrimination of odorants in the environment, 
which involves representation of odorants as unique patterns of 
neuronal activity in the olfactory system. Previous studies have 
shown that segregation of sets of functionally similar inputs from 
olfactory receptor neurons [1, 2] and the postsynaptic outputs of

the dendrites of an exclusive set of mitral/tufted cells. The outputs 
delineate a mechanism for spatial coding of odors among the 
MOB neuron ensembles. Many studies have reported this concept 
of glomeruli as the functional units of spatial code [3-6]. In 
addition to spatial patterns, both glomerular and mitral/tufted cell 
activities demonstrate a stimulus-specific temporal structure [7]. 
Previously, we simultaneously recorded NIRS signals from 
many single neurons in the anesthetized rats while presenting five 
different odorants. We found odor-dependent neural responses 
in the same ensemble of MOB neurons and odor-specific 
localized differential activation in different regions of the MOB 
as in McNamara et al.’s study [8]. We have also reported a method 
for odorant discrimination based on the maximum likelihood 
estimation [9]. These results have given us the hope that we

might develop a sensory brain-machine interface (BMI) for the 
discrimination of valuable chemicals that have odors. 
A drawback of an invasive BMI is the problem of immune 
reaction and inflammation caused when we implant the recording 
micro-wire electrode in the brain. A potential alternative for an 
invasive BMI is a non-invasive BMI based on hemodynamic 
response measurement with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). 
The NIRS is a method to measure hemodynamic changes due 
to different absorption of oxy- (HbO2) and deoxy-hemoglobin 
(Hbr) via light diffusion in the brain and is useful for investigating 
brain function for a number of reasons including reasonable cost, 
high temporal resolution (up to 100 Hz), and portability [10-12]. 
Therefore, in this study we carried out experiments to test the 
possibility of discriminating different kinds of smells by measuring 
hemodynamic responses with a NIRS system in the main olfactory 
bulb of anesthetized rats. We also tested the possible presence of 
odor-dependent regional differences of hemodynamic response 
changes in the MOB.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animal preparations
All protocols were approved by the Hallym University Animal 
Care and Use Committee, and were performed according to 
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the 
U.S. National Institutes of Health as well as the guidelines of the 
Animal Welfare Act. Adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (350~400 
g, male, n=5) were used in this study. The rats where obtained 
from the experimental animal center of Orient Bio Co. (linked 
to the Charles River Lab.). The breeding room environment was 

maintained at a temperature of 23±2oC and relative humidity of 
55±10%. Artificial lighting was maintained for 12 hours per day. 
Two animals were housed in each cage with unlimited food and 
water. Subjects were anesthetized with i.p. injections of urethane 
(20%, 1.25 g/kg body weight) and they were transferred to a 
stereotaxic apparatus and fixed in a prone position. Prior to the 
surgery and optical recording, we checked their motor responses. 
After a one-inch middle incision and removal of the skin and soft 
tissue, the skull was exposed.
We defined the coordinates of the main olfactory (MOB) regions 
(anterior to posterior: +4.0 mm~+12.0 mm, later to medial: 0~±4.0  
mm) from bregma point on the bilateral hemisphere [8].

NIRS and odor-stimulator setup
A commercial sixteen source-channel frequency-domain 
NIRS system (Imagent, ISS, IL., USA) was used to measure the 
cerebral hemodynamic responses to olfactory stimulation. This 
system uses two wavelengths (690 nm, 830 nm), and each channel 
contains two optical fibers with 400 μm core diameter (FT-
400EMT, Thorlabs, NJ, USA) for 690 nm and 830 nm. The optical 
fibers were arranged as shown in Fig. 1A and a picture of the 
actual experiment is shown in Fig. 1B. The NIRS channels, source 
and detector, were separated by 7 mm and the corresponding 
penetration depth is approximately 2 mm, which is sufficient to 
cover the cortex area [10]. They encompass both left and right 
olfactory bulbs. After the optical fibers were placed at appropriate 
locations, dental cement (KetacCem, 3M, USA) was applied to

optodes was followed by 120 s of adaptation. Each test epoch consisted of

Odor-Induced Differential Hemodynamic Responses of Rat MOB

RESULTS

By using the above protocols, we collected NIRS signals for 
odor stimuli. Fig. 4 shows representative plots of hemodynamic 
responses on each channel. The scale of each plot is the “Hbr 
concentration (AU)”; horizontal axis, “Time (s)”: verticalaxis and 
for the representation, while initial level of each signal is set to 0. 
As shown in the figure, stimuli induced an increase in HbO2 levels 
and a decrease in Hbr levels.

Preprocessing and segmentation
To extract clear patterns about hemodynamic responses, signals 
were low pass-filtered with 0.5 Hz cut-off frequency. Then signals 
were segmented into two groups: the response state and the relax 
sate. The relax state indicates 20 seconds of signals before chemical 
stimuli, and the response state indicates of 20 seconds of signals 
after stimuli. The recorded signals are presented on Fig. 5A. To 

the rat skull to maintain a constant boundary condition between 
optical fibers and skull [11, 12]. The sampling rate of the NIRS 
system was 28.4 Hz.
Odorants were diluted with mineral oil to the expected dilution 
rate (approximately 350 PPM) based on individual odorant vapor 
pressure. Following the study of Wilson (2008), mixtures were 
produced by odorant supplements to mineral oil in amounts that 
provided identical component dilution rates within the mixture 
[13]. Fig. 2 shows the odor stimulatior sytem and the NIRS sytem 
where odorants were delivered by delivered by a motorized odor 
stimulator and presented 5 mm from the rat’s nose for 10 seconds 
with plain air. The approximate dilution rate was 1 : 1 with plain 
air. Fig. 3 explains each stimulus was delivered at an interval of 
about 170 seconds and repeated 20 times for each experiment.
We changed silicone tubes and the bottles containing the odorant 
each time we used another odorant to prevent unexpected 
dilution rate. Odorants are: (i) plain air as a reference (Blank), (ii) 
2-Heptanone (HEP), (iii) Isopropylbenzene (IB).

Calculation of hemoglobin concentration
We used an analysis program of Boas and Huppert’s [14] to cal-
cu late cerebral hemodynamic responses. This program provides 
calculation of ΔHbO2 and ΔHbr concentration, block average 
process and image reconstruction. For the recorded intensities 
from each channel, a modified Beer-Lambert law used to calculate 
the hemoglobin concentration.

remove the differences of sensitivity on each channel, the signals 
were normalized by fixing their variances to 1. Black vertical lines 
indicate the temporal location of stimuli. When the stimuli is given 
on time point t, each of the three lines are located on t-20, t and 
t+20. So, the time periods between the first and second line belong 
to the relax state, and periods between the second and third lines 
belong to the response state. As shown in Fig. 5A, hemodynamic 
responses for chemical stimuli were observed as a gradual increase 
of HbO2 levels and a decreasing of Hbr levels.

Temporal detection
Using these responses, we tried to detect an exact time point of 
the odor stimuli (t). To increase sensitivity for the detection, we 
applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a widely 
used mathematical procedure to find orthogonal basis and it 
is useful for explaining general shape of data distribution. The 
method can also be used for extracting linear filters to maximize 
sensitivity for specific responses. We concatenated all signals 
in the relax and response states, then found the most principal

filtered NIRS signals (A), spatial filter w was trained to maximize the 
sensitivity to the stimuli. By projecting original signals to w we obtained a 
new one-dimensional signal (B) that shows drastic peaks near the stimuli 
(indicated as the red box above the plots). To remove drift artifact we 
applied an additional low-pass filter, then obtained the signal on (C). To 
detect the exact time point of the stimuli, we applied the threshold value 
as represented by the blue dashed line on (C). The final detection result 
is plotted in (D). Time periods predicted as the stimuli are plotted with 1, 
otherwise 0. We can see that the prediction results is well matched with 
the actual locations of the stimuli.

component, as follows,

w = arg max(yT[Xrelax, Xres][Xrelax, Xres]Ty),
 

y

when Xrelax, Xres are NIRS signals for relax and response states. 
A useful characteristic of this component is that it can make 
distinctive alterations from the stimuli. The filtered signal obtained 
from wTX is shown in Fig. 5B. By this process, the signals of 16 
channels were transformed into a single channel signal. We could 
see that the obtained signal shows drastic peaks near the stimuli. 
However, gradual alteration of the signal’s baseline acts as an 
obstacle for extracting the exact time point of stimuli. To remove 
this drift, we applied an additional low-pass filter to the signal as 
shown in Fig. 5C. The time ranges of response states, which we 
tried to detect, are presented as the red box above the plot. Then by 
using mean values of relaxes and response states, we calculated the 
threshold for classification. The threshold is drawn as horizontal 
dotted line in Fig. 5C. In conclusion, we could successfully detect 
time periods for response states as shown in Fig. 5D.

Spatial patterns
From the previous analysis, we could extract temporal locations 
of the stimuli. Our next object was classifying the kinds of odor 
stimuli. For the classification, we analyzed the spatial patterns of 
hemodynamic responses. From each trial (a single odor stimuli), 
we calculated each channel’s mean values for relaxes and response 
states, and measured their differences. So, from a single trial, we 
obtained a 16-channel data vector. Odor stimuli were repeated 
20 times for each kind of odor, and three kinds of odors (HEP, IB 
and Blank) were continuously given to the rat, as the sequence 
of Blank, HEP and IB. Then 5 sessions of the above experiment 
were performed with 5 individual rats. As a result, we collected 
300 trials of the difference data vector (20 trials * 3 classes * 5 
sessions) and made the difference data matrix X∈ 16×300. To fulfill 
our object, the classification of odorants, we re-segmented X into 
Xblank, XHEP and XIB, and compared each of them.
Fig. 6 shows the analysis results for the experiment of 4th session 
of the experiment. From X, we extracted only the data vectors 
belonged to session 4, and put that data as matrix X(4)∈ 16×60. 
Then X(4) segmented to Xblank(4), XHEP(4) and XIB(4).
Fig. 6A shows a comparison results between XHEP(4) and Xblank(4). At 
first, we calculated mean values XHEP(4) and Xblank(4), then showed their 
differences on the table on the right side. As already explained, 
he mo dynamic responses for olfactory stimuli are observed as 
increased HbO2 levels with decreased of Hbr levels. Results of the 
table fit well with the phenomena. The results also presented as

topoplots on the left side. The plots show that the differences of 
channel 1A and 6F are more significant than other channels. 
To investigate the possibility of the classification, we performed 
a t-test between XHEP(4) and Xblank(4), then drew topoplots of the 
bottom row based on its results. The p-values obtained from 
two-sample t-test are finer measures than simple difference to 
prove discriminativeness between groups. It considers not only 
differences of means, but also variances, which are closely related 

to overlapping between groups. On the t-test, smaller p-values 
mean that the difference is relatively larger. So, to intensify the 
regions with smaller p-values, we applied a −log function on 
p-values and drew the topoplots by the values. Unlike upper-row 
mean value-based plots, 2B, 7G of HbO2 levels and 4D of Hbr 
levels showed more significant differences on p-value based plots.
The same kind of analysis performed between XIB(4) and Xblank(4)  
as shown in Fig. 6B. Trends of HbO2 and Hbr levels are observed 
quite often with Fig. 6A, as shown on the table and upper plots. 
Furthermore, HEP and IB shares similar spatial patterns. Mean 
value-based plots also indicates 1A and 6F as discriminative 
channels like Fig. 6A and p-value based plots point to 2B, 7G (in 
HbO2) and 4D (in Hbr) as informative channels. Although 1A 
and 6F more significantly emphasized on Hbr levels of p-value 
analysis, general patterns showed similar shapes. However, 
magnitudes of alteration showed clear difference between HEP 
and IB. The differences caused by IB were smaller than the results 
of HEP. The difference caused by HEP stimuli caused HbO2 levels 
to vary from 0.445 to 0.619 (mean value=0.538) and −0.713 to 
−0.401 (mean value=−0.576) on Hbr levels, but IB showed value 
range of 0.162~0.265 (mean value=0.211) and −0.306~−0.182 
(mean value=−0.247). Because of these small differences, p-value 
also showed a higher value range of 10−7~10−3.5.
From the above two analyses, we observed that the hemodynamic 
alteration caused by HEP and IB share similar patterns but their 
magnitude is different. In the third step of analysis, we compared 
XHEP(4) and XIB(4) as shown in Fig. 6C. This analysis is more impor-
tant in practical terms than the previous two analyses, because it is 
directly related to the classification of odors.     
The results in the table were calculated by mean (XHEP(4))−mean 
(XIB(4)). Because of XHEP(4) has larger value ranges than XIB(4), 
values for HbO2 levels have a positive range and values for Hbr 
have a negative range. p-value based plots extract 1A, 4D and 
7G (on HbO2) and 4D and 8H (on Hbr) as the discriminative 
channels. These results are slightly different from the previous 
two comparisons. This difference implies that even though the 
direction of hemodynamic alteration by HEP and IB is similar, 
there is a subtle difference between them, and it could be beneficial 
for following classifications.
We extended the above analysis to the entire data set X from 5 
sessions as shown in Fig. 7. The results were not much different to 
those in Fig. 6. The stimuli increased HbO2 levels and decreased 
Hbr levels. HEP caused more significant response than IB. Mean 
value-based topoplots showed similar results to Fig. 6, but p-value 
based topoplots showed slightly different results because data 
from different rats were mixed.

for each session, and the results are presented in Table 1. The 
performance fluctuated sharply between sessions from 64.8% 
(session 5) to 88.9% (session 4).
Secondly, we performed classification between odorant respon-
ses for two different stimuli. As already explained in the previous 
subsection, the difference between XHEP and XIB is smaller than 
the difference between relax and response signals. To overcome 
this lesser discriminability, we applied RBF (radial basis function) 
kernel-based SVM for the classification.
For the classification of each session, we tried both linear kernel 
and RBF kernel-based classification approaches, and we show best 
results in Table 2. In the first session and the third session, RBF 
kernel was used and in other sessions, linear kernel was used. The 
mean accuracy of the classifying stimuli was 77.9%, while the mean 
accuracy of odor classifications was 75.0%. 77.9% and 75.0% may 
not be satisfactory scores from the viewpoint of interface research. 
However, we confirmed that the magnitude of hemodynamic 
response from two different odor stimuli is significantly different, 
and sometimes it enables plausible accuracy of the classification 
as shown in the result of the session 4. We also observed subtle 
differences of spatial patterns between two responses on the t-test. 
These aspects of spatial patterns differences imply that improved 
measuring device/techniques and sophisticated classification 
algorithms can enhance the performance of the BMI system.

DISCUSSION

Classification
By the above analysis, we confirmed that the classification of each 
odor stimuli could be possible. As the final step of the analysis, we 
tried classification of signals. At first, we attempt the classification 
between relax signals (Xblank) and response signals (XHEP, XIB). For 
the classification, we used the linear-kernel based SVM (Support 
Vector Machine) method. To evaluate classification performances, 
we performed 5-fold cross validation test. We calculated the test 

The main goal of this study was to use the NIRS system to record 
activity in the olfactory bulb. As mirrored by changes in blood 
flow during presentation of chemical odorants as well as spicy fruit 
(HEP), aromatic smell (IB) and plain air (Blank), respectively.  
The NIRS system has several advantages specifically it is non-
invasive, not painful and confers no exposure to harmful light 
sources. Previously studies with functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) in adults have shown that olfactory stimulation 
activates a number of different regions of the brain [15-17].

Odor-Induced Differential Hemodynamic Responses of Rat MOB

Previously NIRs studies just focused on results of fMRI or PET 
studies during motor, visual and cognitive experiments [18-
21]. However, in recent years, NIRs has become useful systems 
in mapping the brain during dynamic experiments. We have 
obtained a significant result by investigating the change of 
hemodynamic responses in the olfactory regions of an animal’s 
brain.
Our study confirmed that NIRS were able to measure the specific 
hemodynamic responses of the brain during the presentation of 
various odors. The responses were from the MOB of anesthetized 
rats in experiments. Here we wish to point out that the method of 
similar study that was previously carried out the difference pattern 
of neuron spikes from MOB via invasive method to the odor 
discrimination. 
The alterations of hemodynamic responses caused by HEP, 
aromatic smells (perceived by adults as a spicy fruity smell) were 
2.2 times greater than IB (perceived by adults as an aromatic smell) 
but those alterations were stronger than the response the plain 
air. It might be tempting to explain this in terms of quantitative 
differences in emitted molecules and hence in the number of odor 
receptors engaged or the intensity of the inactivation [22].
We showed topoplots that reflected the regional basic activation 
patterns of olfactory bulbs during presentation of various odors in 
rodents. And through recorded raw data we can inferred the time 
when stimuli presented during the experiment session. Each of 
these results is very interesting as a scientific research. 
Hence further studies are needed to delve into the influence of 
other experimental parameters, such as the number of stimuli, rate 
of dilution, order of stimuli, kinds of odorant on hemodynamic 
responses on olfactory bulbs. In this study, we presented from 
18 to 20 times odor stimuli (total n; 5 rats, 90~100 times odor 
stimuli/each rat) to measure hemodynamic responses. Further 
studies should also investigate the number of stimuli and the 
discrimination accuracy with multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) 
modeling method called “Granger causality”. According to Schlogl’s 
study [23], the accuracy of the MVAR estimation is somewhat 
dependent on the number of time samples and the variance of the 
prediction error becomes smaller than 10% of the signal variance 
if the number of samples is larger than 70. The topoplots could 
provide more chance for the understanding brain activities such 
as hemodynamic responses that in odor stimuli tasks using NIRs. 
This is also of interest in connection with the specific brain region 
while presenting various stimuli such as music, decision making 
problems, or video games.
This experiment is intended to yield results that can be applied 
to develop a prototype BMI system for olfactory discrimination 
from brain blood changes, recorded either electro-physiological 

or optical (NIRS) methods. And practical applications of the 
olfactory sensory BMI could be used for various scent industries.
