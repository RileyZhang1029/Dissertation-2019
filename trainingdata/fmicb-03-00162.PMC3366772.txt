Current human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 pandemic is believed to originate from cross-
species transmission of simian immunodeﬁciency virus (SIV) into human population. Such
cross-species transmission, however, is not efﬁcient in general, because viral replication is
modulated by host cell factors, with the species-speciﬁcity of these factors affecting viral
tropism. An understanding of those host cell factors that affect viral replication contributes
to elucidation of the mechanism for determination of viral tropism.This review will focus an
anti-viral effect of ApoB mRNA editing catalytic subunit, tripartite motif protein 5 alpha, and
cyclophilins on SIV replication and provide insight into the mechanism of species-speciﬁc
barriers against viral infection in human cells. It will then present our current understanding
of the mechanism that may explain zoonotic transmission of retroviruses.

INTRODUCTION
There is signiﬁcant evidence that the ongoing worldwide acquired
immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic was caused by
cross-species transmission of simian immunodeﬁciency viruses
(SIVs) into the human population. Replication of primate
lentiviruses in their natural hosts is generally non-pathogenic;
however, cross-species transmission of these viruses can result
in highly pathogenic phenotypes. How and when this transmis-
sion occurred is still debated but it is now generally accepted that
HIV-2 originated from a sooty mangabeys strain of SIV (SIVsm;
Hirsch et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1996) while HIV-1 appears to
have originated from a chimpanzee strain of SIV (SIVcpz; Gao
et al., 1999). Zoonotic transmission of SIVs, however,
is not
common and is controlled by host factors that generally pro-
hibit SIV replication in human hosts and many human-derived
cell lines.

Viral replication is modulated by host cell factors, with the
species-speciﬁcity of these factors affecting viral tropism. Some of
these host factors can restrict viral replication and the anti-viral
systems mediated by such host restriction factors, termed intrinsic
immunity, play an important role in determining species-speciﬁc
barriers against viral infection. For instance, Fv-1 in mice is known
to restrict replication of a murine leukemia virus (Rein et al., 1976;
Gautsch et al., 1978; Towers et al., 2000) and tripartite interaction
motif 5α (TRIM5α) recently has been found to be responsible
for restricting HIV-1 but not SIV infection in Old World monkey
(OWM) cells (Hatziioannou et al., 2004b; Keckesova et al., 2004;
Stremlau et al., 2004; Yap et al., 2004; Song et al., 2005; Ylinen et al.,
2005). Restriction of retroviral replication by these host cell fac-
tors takes place after viral entry, but before the integration step,
and the viral determinants for this type of restriction have been
mapped to the capsid (CA) protein (Gautsch et al., 1978; Kozak
and Chakraborti, 1996; Towers et al., 2000; Goff, 2004; Stremlau
et al., 2006). Two recent studies showed that the cellular protein
SAMHD1 is myeloid-lineage cell-speciﬁc HIV-1 restriction factor

counteracted by Vpx proteins from HIV-2 and SIVsm (Hrecka
et al., 2011; Laguette et al., 2011). Restriction of lentivirus infec-
tion by SAMHD1 is likely to take place at the reverse transcription
step. Another anti-retroviral protein, tetherin (also referred to as
BST-2, CD317, or HM1.24) inhibits retrovirus release and is antag-
onized by HIV-1 Vpu protein, Nef protein of many SIVs, or Env
protein of HIV-2 (Neil et al., 2008; Le Tortorec and Neil, 2009;
Zhang et al., 2009). Understanding how host cell factors affect
viral replication, positively or negatively, would contribute to elu-
cidating the molecular mechanism that determines viral tropism.
Here, we discuss an anti-viral effect of ApoB mRNA editing cat-
alytic subunit (APOBEC), TRIM5α, and cyclophilins (Cyps) on
SIV replication.

APOBEC: ENZYMATIC RESTRICTION FACTOR THAT
TARGET RETROVIRUSES
Replication of HIV-1 in primary CD4+ T cells, monocyte, and
some immortalized T cell lines depends on the presence of the
HIV-1 accessory gene product, Vif (standing for virus infectiv-
ity factor; Fisher et al., 1987; Strebel et al., 1987), and it works
in a host cell-speciﬁc manner. Vif is required for enhanced HIV-
1 replication in some cell types called non-permissive cells. In
contrast, HIV-1 replication is Vif-independent in permissive cells
(Akari et al., 1992; Fan and Peden, 1992; Gabuzda et al., 1992;
Blanc et al., 1993; Sakai et al., 1993; von Schwedler et al., 1993;
Borman et al., 1995). Recently, some cytidine deaminases were
identiﬁed as a new class of host restriction factors that target retro-
viruses such as HIV-1 or SIV (Harris and Liddament, 2004; Cullen,
2006). APOBEC3G (Apo3G), a member of the APOBEC family of
cytidine deaminases, is the ﬁrst identiﬁed enzymatic restriction
factor and the determinant that makes cells permissive or non-
permissive. Apo3G is also a host factor that restricts replication
of human and simian lentiviruses in their respective target cells.
Unlike TRIM5α or Fv-1, Apo3G does not exert its anti-viral activ-
ity by targeting the viral CA protein, but it has to be incorporated

into a newly synthesized virion during a production step, and then
inhibits virus replication by targeting single-stranded viral cDNA
during a subsequent infection step. HIV-1 counteracts Apo3G with
Vif expression. During the production of progeny virions, Vif
binds to Apo3G and induces Apo3G’s proteasomal degradation,
resulting in the decreased steady-state levels of human Apo3G
(hApo3G; Yu et al., 2003).

There are several anti-retroviral mechanisms of Apo3G against
HIV-1 infection. First, Apo3G-containing virus can accumulate
in a large number of substitutions that register as cytidine (C) to
deoxyuridine (dU) in a virus minus-strand during reverse tran-
scription, resulting guanine (G) to adenine (A) mutations in a
viral plus-strand, known as “G-to-A hypermutation” (Harris et al.,
2003; Lecossier et al., 2003; Mangeat et al., 2003; Mariani et al.,
2003; Zhang et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2004b). Second, Apo3G can
inhibit tRNA annealing or tRNA processing during reverse tran-
scription (Guo et al., 2006, 2007; Mbisa et al., 2007). Third, Apo3G
inhibits DNA strand transfer or integration (Li et al., 2007; Luo
et al., 2007; Mbisa et al., 2007). Although Apo3G has the most
potent anti-HIV-1 activity among the APOBEC family of proteins,
another member of the family, APOBEC3F (Apo3F) was shown to
inhibit HIV-1 infection in the absence of Vif (Bishop et al., 2004a;
Liddament et al., 2004; Wiegand et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2004),
whereas APOBEC3B (Apo3B) can inhibit HIV-1 infection in both
the presence and absence of Vif (Bishop et al., 2004a; Doehle et al.,
2005; Rose et al., 2005).

Although we can imagine the broad range of anti-retroviral
activity of APOBEC family because APOBEC proteins from
non-human species can also inhibit HIV-1 infection (Mari-
ani et al., 2003; Bishop et al., 2004a,b; Wiegand et al., 2004;
Cullen, 2006),
the Vif-Apo3G interaction is thought to be
species-speciﬁc (Simon et al., 1998; Mariani et al., 2003). Accord-
ingly, hApo3G is insensitive to SIVagm Vif while African green
monkey Apo3G (agmApo3G) is insensitive to HIV-1 Vif and
the determinant of this species-speciﬁcity depends on amino
acid 128 of hApo3G and agmApo3G (Mariani et al., 2003; Bogerd
et al., 2004; Mangeat et al., 2004; Schrofelbauer et al., 2004; Xu
et al., 2004).

However, such species-speciﬁcity is not strictly controlled,
for example, a report from the laboratory of Klaus Strebel
demonstrated that SIVagm Vif supported replication of SIVagm
virus in the hApo3G-positive human A3.01 T cell line (Takeuchi
et al., 2005). Replication of vif-defective SIVagm in A3.01 cells
was severely restricted, resulted in an accumulation of cyti-
dine deaminase-induced G-to-A mutations in SIVagm genome
(Takeuchi et al., 2005).

Moreover, two independent groups showed that the differ-
ent APOBEC3 family members function to neutralize speciﬁc
lentiviruses (Yu et al., 2004a; Dang et al., 2006). One report from
the lab of Dr. Nathaniel R. Landau showed that APOBEC3B and
APOBEC3C were potent inhibitors of SIV (Yu et al., 2004a). Both
enzymes were efﬁciently encapsidated by HIV-1 and SIV. Another
report from the lab of Dr. Yong-Hui Zheng demonstrated that
APOBEC3DE blocked the replication of both HIV-1 and SIV but
not that of MLV (Dang et al., 2006) and APOBEC3H inhibited
the replication of HIV-1 by a cytidine deamination-independent
mechanism (Dang et al., 2008). These ﬁndings raise the possibility

that the various APOBEC3 family members protect against dif-
ferent lentiviruses and point to a possible role in the zoonotic
transmission of SIV.

TRIM5α: FV-1-TYPE HOST FACTOR RESTRICTING
HIV-1 IN PRIMATE CELLS
The host protein which dictates Ref1 activity was identiﬁed as an
α-isoform of rhesus macaque TRIM5 protein by the laboratory
of Dr. Joseph Sodroski (Stremlau et al., 2004). TRIM5 is a mem-
ber of the TRIM family of proteins, and has RING, B-box 2, and
coiled-coil as common and conserved domains among the family
and B30.2 (PRYSPRY) domain on its C-terminal region (Nisole
et al., 2005). Subsequently, the human and non-human primate
homologs of TRIM5α were shown to restrict retroviruses, such as
N-MLV, and equine infectious anemia virus (Hatziioannou et al.,
2004b; Keckesova et al., 2004; Perron et al., 2004; Yap et al., 2004;
Song et al., 2005; Ylinen et al., 2005; Si et al., 2006). Rhesus mon-
key TRIM5α (rhTRIM5α) has strong anti-HIV-1 activity but only
modestly restricts SIV isolated from a macaque monkey (SIVmac)
and does not block MLV infection, whereas its human homolog
does not restrict HIV-1 infection.

TRIM5α recognizes incoming viral cores, but not a monomeric
CA protein, thorough its B30.2 (PRYSPRY) domain. B-box 2 and
coiled-coil domains are required for TRIM5α multimerization,
and both coiled-coil and B30.2 (PRYSPRY) domains are essen-
tial for viral core binding (Reymond et al., 2001; Stremlau et al.,
2006). TRIM5α captures HIV-1 core at a very early step(s) after
infection, immediately after the release of the core into cyto-
plasm. To restrict HIV-1 infection and to recognize viral core,
TRIM5α must oligomerize through its B-box 2 and coiled-coil
domains (Mische et al., 2005; Li and Sodroski, 2008). Its RING
domain has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. It self-ubiquitination
occurs TRIM5α is quickly degraded (Diaz-Griffero et al., 2006).
This rapid degradation of TRIM5α is not required for post-
entry restriction since replacement of TRIM5α RING domain
with the corresponding domain of TRIM21, which has lower
self-ubiquitination activity and a longer half-life than TRIM5α
did not alter the anti-viral activity (Kar et al., 2008). Recently,
the laboratory of Dr. Mark Yeager discussed a novel architecture
made with dimers of TRIM5-21R. TRIM5α-21R forms a dimer
through its B-box 2 and coiled-coil domains, and these dimers
form six-sided rings on CA lattices to promote rapid core disas-
sembly (Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011). Overexpression of TRIM5α
leads to the formation of cytoplasmic bodies and is believed to
be required for its anti-viral activity (Stremlau et al., 2006; Camp-
bell et al., 2008). During TRIM5α-mediated post-entry restriction,
disassembly of viral cores is induced too quickly and the accumu-
lation of viral RT-products is reduced (Stremlau et al., 2006). On
the other hand, MG132 treatment inhibited quick-disassembly,
yet HIV-1 infectivity was still restricted. Two reports showed that
TRIM5α could block not only viral cDNA accumulation but also
the nuclear import of viral cDNA (Berthoux et al., 2004; Wu et al.,
2006). Thus, TRIM5α-mediated post-entry restriction is thought
to have at least two phases: (i) TRIM5α induces rapid disassembly
of viral core in a proteasome-dependent manner and (ii) TRIM5α
degrades HIV-1 cDNAs in a proteasome-independent manner.
The determinant of speciﬁcity and magnitude of the post-entry

Receptor-independent SIV tropism

restriction lies on B30.2 (PRYSPRY) domain. Previous report
showed that TRIM5α alleles did not cluster by species between rhe-
sus macaques and sooty mangabeys and none of the alleles from
either species restricted SIV, suggesting that there is little effect
of rhTRIM5α on transmission of SIVsm within species (New-
man et al., 2006). Recently, Pacheco et al. (2010) reported that
New World monkey (NWM) TRIM5α restricts foamy virus infec-
tion. Another consideration is the clinical signiﬁcance of TRIM5α
against AIDS in human. Moreover, several reports showed that
the efﬁcacy of TRIM5α-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replica-
tion might interfere with disease progression of AIDS in humans
(van Manen et al., 2008; Cagliani et al., 2010; Takeuchi et al., 2012).
Thus, TRIM5α-mediated restriction may be a multi-step process
in retrovirus replication with the relationship between other host
factor(s).

Recently, the lab of Dr. Yasuhiro Ikeda reported that rhesus
macaque TRIM5α also inhibits HIV-1 production by inducing
the degradation of a viral precursor Gag protein (Sakuma et al.,
2007). To restrict HIV-1 production, amino acid residues in
B-box 2 and coiled-coil domains dictated the speciﬁcity of the
restriction. In the late restriction, the accumulation of HIV-1
RNA was not affected but the accumulation of precursor Gag
was inhibited in an ubiquitin–proteasome-independent man-
ner. This TRIM5α-mediated late-restriction is still controversial
(Zhang et al., 2008), yet it is conceivable that TRIM5α restricts
HIV-1 infection and production in two distinct mechanisms.
Although TRIM5α restricts HIV-1 infection in a broad range of
cells, its late restriction involved transient overexpression (Sakuma
et al., 2007).

Here is another notable class of the TRIM family called TRIM-
Cyp isolated from NWM. A report from the laboratory of Dr.
Jeremy Luban demonstrated that owl monkey cells express TRIM-
Cyp that restricts HIV-1 infection (Sayah et al., 2004). Although
TRIM-Cyp has a cyclophilin A (CypA) sequence in its C-terminal
region instead of B30.2 (PRYSPRY) domain that dictates the
speciﬁcity and the magnitude of post-entry restriction in OWM
TRIM5α-mediated post-entry restriction, it recognizes incoming
core structure and restricts HIV-1 infection (Stremlau et al., 2006).
Recently, TRIM-Cyp mRNA was also detected in a rhesus macaque
cell, and overexpressed rhesus TRIM-Cyp restricts HIV-1 infection
and production (Newman et al., 2006; Brennan et al., 2008; Wilson
et al., 2008; Dietrich et al., 2010).

Unlike other restriction factors, there is no known accessory
gene product of HIV-1 to antagonize TRIM5α-mediated restric-
tions. Indeed, human TRIM5α has only a modest restriction
activity against HIV-1 infection. TRIM5 proteins from several
NWM species restrict infection by SIVmac and SIVagm (Song
et al., 2005). This suggests that TRIM5α could be a key molecule
of the species-species barrier.

CYCLOPHILINS: HOST FACTORS INVOLVED IN
RETROVIRUS REPLICATION
Cyclophilins are ubiquitous proteins and ﬁrst identiﬁed as the
target of cyclosporine A (CsA), an immunosuppressive reagent
(Takahashi et al., 1989). CypA has proline-isomerase activity that
catalyzes the cis–trans isomerization of proline residue (Fischer
et al., 1989). The binding of CsA to CypA inhibits this isomerase

activity (Takahashi et al., 1989). In retrovirus replication, CypA
was found to bind HIV-1 CA in the yeast two-hybrid system
(Luban et al., 1993). The sequence Ala88-Gly89-Pro90-Ile91 of
CA protein is the major fragment bound to the active site
of CypA (Franke et al., 1994; Gamble et al., 1996; Zhao et al.,
1997). Interestingly, The peptidyl-prolyl bond between Gly89
and Pro90 of the CA fragment has a trans conformation,
in
contrast to the cis conformation observed in other known CypA–
peptide complexes (Zhao et al., 1997; Bosco et al., 2002), and
Gly89 preceding Pro90 has an unfavorable backbone formation
usually only adopted by glycine, suggesting that special Gly89-
Pro90 sequence but not other Gly-Pro motif is required for
the binding of CA protein to CypA. Therefore, CypA might be
likely to act as a molecular chaperone but not a cis–trans iso-
merase (Zhao et al., 1997). However, one report showed that
CypA does not only bind CA protein but also catalyzes efﬁ-
ciently cis–trans isomerization of Gly89-Pro90 peptidyl-prolyl
bond (Bosco et al., 2002). The relationship between the Gly89-
Pro90 bond and catalysis of cis–trans isomerization by CypA
remains unclear.

It has been well established that CypA promotes an early step
of HIV-1 infection in human cells (Franke et al., 1994; Thali et al.,
1994; Braaten et al., 1996a,c; Franke and Luban, 1996; Braaten
and Luban, 2001; Sokolskaja et al., 2004; Hatziioannou et al.,
2005). CypA is efﬁciently encapsidated into HIV-1 produced
from infected cells through interaction with the CA domains
of the Gag polyprotein and disruption of CypA incorporation
into virions by CsA or HIV-1 Gag mutants caused a decrease
in replication efﬁciency (Franke et al., 1994; Thali et al., 1994;
Ott et al., 1995; Braaten et al., 1996a; Bukovsky et al., 1997; Ack-
erson et al., 1998; Braaten and Luban, 2001). It is still unclear
how CypA is efﬁciently packaged into HIV-1 virion, but several
reports showed that both dimerization of CA and multimer-
ization of CypA are required for efﬁcient interaction (Colgan
et al., 1996; Javanbakht et al., 2007). Although CA-CypA inter-
action is required for infectivity, the important point is that
CypA interacts with incoming HIV-1 cores in newly infected
target cells rather than during HIV-1 budding from the virion
producer cells, indicating that target cell CypA promotes HIV-1
infectivity (Kootstra et al., 2003; Towers et al., 2003; Sokolskaja
et al., 2004).

CypA-dependent virus replication is only limited to retro-
viruses which encode CA that binds CypA. In fact, only those
retroviruses are dependent upon CypA for replication (Luban
et al., 1993; Franke et al., 1994; Thali et al., 1994; Braaten et al.,
1996c; Franke and Luban, 1996). These observations suggested
that CA–CypA interaction might contribute tropism determinants
for retroviruses. HIV-1 infection in non-human primate cells is
blocked prior to reverse transcription after virus entry (Shibata
et al., 1995; Himathongkham and Luciw, 1996; Hofmann et al.,
1999; Besnier et al., 2002; Cowan et al., 2002; Munk et al., 2002;
Hatziioannou et al., 2003; Towers et al., 2003). This restriction
is thought to be the same step in the retrovirus life cycle where
CypA works (Braaten et al., 1996b). Indeed, analysis of CypA-
binding region of CA with chimeric viruses of HIV-1 and SIV
showed the viral determinant for species-speciﬁcity (Shibata et al.,
1991, 1995; Dorfman and Gottlinger, 1996; Bukovsky et al., 1997;

Towers et al., 2003; Berthoux et al., 2004; Hatziioannou et al.,
2004a, 2006; Ikeda et al., 2004; Sayah et al., 2004; Stremlau et al.,
2004; Kamada et al., 2006).

Human CypA is required for efﬁcient HIV-1 infection but not
SIV. There is no known role for CypA in SIV infection in human
cells. Recently, the ﬁrst report from the laboratory of Klaus Strebel
showed that human CypA acts as restriction factor against the
infection of two SIVs (SIVmac and SIVagm) in human cells,
and Vif protein of two SIVs counteracts a CypA-imposed inhi-
bition against the infection of two SIV strains with exclusion of
CypA from SIV virion (Takeuchi et al., 2007). This phenomenon
is different from the function of SIVagm Vif against hApo3G
previously reported from the same laboratory (Takeuchi et al.,
2005) because they used human cells lacking detectable deaminase
activity.

Moreover, a recent report showed a species-speciﬁc effect of
CsA, a peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase (PPIase) inhibitor, on
SIV replication, implying a possible contribution of Cyps to the
determination of SIV tropism (Figure 1; Takeuchi et al., 2012).
They demonstrated a host species-speciﬁc effect of CypA on SIV
replication: CypA affects the replication of two SIVs (SIVmac
and SIVagm) negatively in human cells but positively in macaque
cells (Figure 1). Further analysis indicated that the infection of
two SIVs was not signiﬁcantly affected by CypA but inhibited by
cyclophilin B (CypB), another PPIase, in human cells (Figure 2A;
Takeuchi et al., 2012). In contrast, CypA is likely to have positive

effects on the infection of two SIVs in macaque cells (Figure 2B;
Takeuchi et al., 2012). These results suggest that Cyps might have
a host species-speciﬁc effect of Cyps on SIV replication and pro-
vide insight into the mechanism of species-speciﬁc barriers against
viral infection.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Viral replication is modulated by host cell factors. Many of these
factors function in a species-speciﬁc manner. On the other hand,
there exist host factors that restrict viral replication. The anti-
viral system mediated by some of these restriction factors, termed
intrinsic immunity, which is distinguished from the conventional
innate and adaptive immunity has been indicated to play an

important role in making species-speciﬁc barriers against viral
infection. As discussed in this review, we describe the current
progress in understanding of such restriction factors against retro-
viral replication, especially focusing on TRIM5α and APOBEC
whose anti-retroviral effects have recently been recognized. Addi-
tionally, we mentioned a host species-speciﬁc effect of Cyps
including CypA and CypB on SIV replication. Such restriction fac-
tors would play an important role in determining species-speciﬁc
barriers against viral infection.
