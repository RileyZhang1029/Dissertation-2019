Although members of the serine (S)- and arginine (R)-rich
splicing factor family (SR proteins) were initially purified
on the basis of their splicing activity in the nucleus, there
is recent documentation that they exhibit carbohydrate-
binding activity at the cell surface. In contrast, galectins
were isolated on the basis of their saccharide-binding activ-
ity and cell surface localization. Surprisingly, however,
two members (galectin-1 and galectin-3) can be found in
association with nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes in-
cluding the spliceosome and, using a cell-free assay, have
been shown to be required splicing factors. Thus, despite
the difference in terms of their original points of interest,
it now appears that members of the two protein families
share four key properties: (a) nuclear and cytoplasmic
distribution; (b) pre-mRNA splicing activity; (c) carbo-
hydrate-binding activity; and (d) cell surface localization
in specific cells. These findings provoke stimulating ques-
tions regarding the relationship between splicing factors
in the nucleus and carbohydrate-binding proteins at the
cell surface.

Annotations: name and location

The availability of genome sequences of a variety of species,
the development of high throughput screening methodologies
such as DNA microarrays, and the reﬁnement of computational
algorithms for searching large databases have all stimulated
more and more genome-wide investigations. In turn, the inter-
pretation of the results of such studies yielding large data sets
has depended on the annotation of genes, which suggests rela-
tionships in terms of subcellular localization, biochemical
activity, or connectivity via a metabolic pathway. Most of the
annotations in the databases, however, are predicated on two
key tenets in the “classical” approach in naming a gene or pro-

tein: (a) the assay used in the initial puriﬁcation of the protein;
and (b) localization in a subcellular compartment consistent
with expectations.

More recently, it has become evident that many proteins
comprise multiple distinct domains and can interact with a be-
wildering number of other moieties ranging from other
polypeptide sequences to carbohydrate and nucleic acid se-
quences. In addition, members of many diﬀerent classes of
proteins (secreted growth factors, transcription factors, cytoskel-
etal proteins, and glycolytic enzymes) have been identiﬁed in
cellular compartments other than their “classical” site of action.
In the present essay, we focus on two protein families that have
recently been shown to share localization and functional simi-
larities: carbohydrate-binding at the cell surface and RNA
processing inside the nucleus.

Two protein families: SR proteins and galectins

Splicing factor 2/alternative splicing factor (SF2/ASF) was ini-
tially identiﬁed as an activity required for constitutive splicing
(Krainer et al. 1990) and as a factor that could modulate
5′-splice site selection (Ge and Manley 1990). SF2/ASF
(Ge et al. 1991; Krainer et al. 1991), now designated Sfrs1
(Table I), represents the prototype of a family of splicing
factors containing the RS domain, rich in arginine and ser-
ine dipeptides. Additional RS-domain-containing proteins
were identiﬁed by a monoclonal antibody (mAb 104) which
recognizes a phosphoepitope shared by the SR proteins
(Zahler et al. 1992). These include spliceosomal component
35 (SC35; Sfrs2), another factor required for spliceosome as-
sembly (Fu and Maniatis 1990). The SR protein family now
contains seven “canonical” members, using the criteria de-
scribed by Long and Caceres (2009). In addition to this
canonical SR family, other SR-related families have been de-
scribed, such as non-canonical SR proteins, SR-related
proteins, and RS-domain-containing proteins (for recent re-
views, see Long and Caceres 2009; Shepard and Hertel
2009). In the present essay, we use the name SR protein fam-
ily to refer to the seven “canonical” SR proteins. Although a
common nomenclature and a numbering system has been des-
ignated for the seven members of the SR protein family,
investigators in the ﬁeld of splicing have continued, for the
most part, using the original name corresponding to each spe-
ciﬁc SR protein (Table I). All eukaryotes express some SR
family member or recognizable SR-like proteins.

The SR proteins exhibit a modular structure (Figure 1A)
with one or two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that provide
the basis for RNA-binding activity. In cases where it has been
analyzed, individual SR proteins exhibit speciﬁc yet degener-

ate RNA-binding speciﬁcities (Liu et al. 1998, 2000; Sanford
et al. 2008). The carboxyl terminal RS domain is characterized
as being “disordered” (Haynes and Iakoucheva 2006). Never-
theless, this domain participates in either protein–protein or
protein–RNA interactions in assembly of the spliceosome, as
well as in targeting the polypeptide to the nucleus (see below).
The galectins are a family of carbohydrate-binding proteins that
share two key properties: (a) binding aﬃnity for β-galactosides;
and (b) conserved sequence elements in the saccharide-binding
site (Barondes et al. 1994). To date, 15 mammalian galectins have
been identiﬁed (Table II). Galectins have also been identiﬁed in
many non-mammalian species, including birds, amphibians, ﬁsh,
worms, sponges, and fungi. Screening the databases of genomic
DNA sequences and expressed sequence tags has revealed addi-
tional candidates for membership in the mammalian galectin
family, as well as putative galectins in plants and viruses (Cooper
2002).

Each member of the galectin family contains at least one
domain of about 130 amino acids;
this domain binds to
saccharides and is designated the carbohydrate recognition
domain (CRD) (Figure 1B). Based on the number and organi-

zation of domains in the polypeptides, the galectins have been
classiﬁed into subfamilies (Hirabayashi and Kasai 1993): (a)
the prototype group contains one domain, the CRD; (b) the
chimera group contains a proline (P)- and glycine (G)-rich do-
main (also about 130 amino acids) fused amino terminal to the
CRD; and (c) the tandem repeat group contains two CRDs.

In the amino acid sequence of galectin-3 (Gal3), the sole
representative of the chimera group, the P- and G-rich domain
is characterized by multiple internal sequence homologies,
each of which consists of a nine-residue repeat with a consen-
sus sequence of Pro–Gly–Ala–Tyr–Pro–Gly, followed by
three additional amino acids. Diﬀerential scanning calorimetry
of the murine Gal3 polypeptide yielded distinct transition
temperatures for the amino terminal, P- and G-rich domain
(~40°C), and the carboxy-terminal CRD (~55°C), both in
the full-length polypeptide and as isolated preparations of

Four properties shared by SR proteins and galectins
Binding of carbohydrates
Recently, Hatakeyama et al. (2009) reported that Sfrs1, Sfrs2,
Sfrs5, and Sfrs7 are expressed at the cell surface of lung
endothelial cells (see below). Even more striking was the
observation that these SR proteins exhibited carbohydrate-
binding activity. In previous studies, a short peptide (IELL-
QAR), designated I-peptide, was shown to be a carbohydrate
mimicry peptide and inhibited carbohydrate-dependent lung
colonization of sialyl Lewis X-expressing B16-FTIII-M cells
(B16 melanoma cells transfected with fucosyltransferase 3)
in E-selectin and P-selectin doubly deﬁcient mutant mice
(Fukuda et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2002). When a membrane
protein fraction from rat lung was subjected to I-peptide aﬃn-
ity chromatography, the four SR splicing factors were isolated
and identiﬁed by mass spectrometry. Recombinant Sfrs1
bound to B16-FTIII-M cells (expressing the sialyl LeX carbo-
hydrate) but not to parental B16 cells. Thus, it appears that
endothelial cells expressing cell surface SR splicing factors
were responsible for the carbohydrate-dependent binding and
lung colonization of the sialyl LeX-expressing B16-FTIII-M
cells.

Using a glycan array, it was determined that Sfrs1 bound a se-
ries of fucosylated oligosaccharides, including H-type 1, H-type
2, LeX, LeY, and LeB structures (Hatakeyama et al. 2009). Sfrs1
also exhibited strong binding to α-rhamnose (6-deoxy-mannose);
this was rationalized in terms of the structural similarity of this
saccharide to fucose (6-deoxy-galactose). These results provoke
questions and investigations at several levels. First, do other
members of the SR protein family also bind carbohydrates?
Second, what is the structural basis for the observed carbohy-
drate-binding activity of Sfrs1? Finally, since it was reported
that Sfrs1 requires calcium for binding to saccharides, is there a
calcium-dependent CRD as seen in the C-type lectins (Zelensky
and Gready 2005)?

The carbohydrate-binding speciﬁcity of various puriﬁed
galectins has been studied extensively and interpreted in
terms of the three-dimensional structures which have been de-
termined for CRDs derived from galectin-1 (Gal1), galectin-2,
Gal3, galectin-7, and galectin-10 (see Leﬄer et al. 2004 for an
overview). The CRDs all show a highly conserved tight fold,
with two anti-parallel β-pleated sheets forming a sandwich-
like structure (Rini and Lobsanov 1999). Amino acid side
chains on one of these sheets form the core carbohydrate-
binding site; the highly conserved residues responsible for
saccharide-binding include H158, N160, R162, N174, W181,
E184, and R186 (residue numbering from the human Gal3
sequence as reported in Seetharaman et al. 1998).

The composite picture derived from ligand binding and
structural studies suggests that the binding site is composed
of at least four subsites, each of which interacts with a single
monosaccharide unit (Leﬄer and Barondes 1986; Knibbs et al.
1993; Hirabayashi et al. 2002). More recently, this has been
reﬁned to six subsites (designated as A, B, C, D, D′, and E)
by Stowell et al. (2008), who conducted a detailed dose–

SR proteins and galectins

response analysis of the binding of Gal1, galectin-2, and Gal3
to a microarray containing hundreds of structurally diverse
glycans. The major and most conserved feature in the interac-
tion of a galectin polypeptide with saccharides is the binding
of a galactose residue in subsite C. This includes direct inter-
action of the monosaccharide with six of the seven most
highly conserved amino acid residues listed above. The bind-
ing of a second monosaccharide unit in subsite D is also
signiﬁcant inasmuch as there is an approximately 100-fold
higher aﬃnity for lactose than for galactose. Subsite D allows
for variations such as in lactose (Galβ1-4Glc) versus lactosa-
mine (Galβ1-4GlcNAc). Diﬀerences in the speciﬁcities of the
galectins are often reﬂected in the preference of subsite D for
diﬀerent monosaccharides. Other ﬁne features of the speciﬁc-
ity of galectins can be additionally accounted for by their
ability to accommodate diﬀerent saccharides (Gal, GalNAc,
GlcNAc, Fuc, or NeuAc) or aglycone groups (e.g., sulfate)
in subsite B, with further extensions in subsite A.

As an example, Gal3 binds type 1 or type 2 Galβ1→3(4)
GlcNAc chains, and the aﬃnity for straight-chain polylactosa-
mine structures or complex-type branched glycans is increased
over the simple disaccharide. Fucosylation or sialylation of
terminal galactose residues or further substitution by (α1→3)-
linked Gal or GalNAc does not aﬀect binding or may even
enhance it, whereas substitution (occupying subsite D′) of the
penultimate GlcNAc residue in subsite D drastically reduces
binding. Thus, blood group A, H-type 1, or H-type 2 structures
show high aﬃnity, whereas LeA and LeX structures bind
poorly. While Gal1 and galectin-2 share some common binding
characteristics with Gal3, it is important to note that the study
of Stowell et al. (2008) highlights the fact that, in mechanistic
detail, each of the galectins diﬀers in binding to glycans on
microarrays and on cell surfaces. These diﬀerences provide
the basis for unique and/or opposing biological activities.

Cell surface expression and extracellular localization
In addition to the isolation of Sfrs1, Sfrs2, Sfrs5, and Sfrs7 as
carbohydrate-binding receptors, several other lines of evidence
are consistent with the notion that SR proteins are expressed at
the cell surface of endothelial cells (Hatakeyama et al. 2009).
First, mice were injected with anti-Sfrs1 antibodies through the
tail vein. Lung tissue sections prepared from such mice yielded
ﬂuorescent capillaries when visualized with ﬂuorescence-
conjugated secondary antibody. In contrast, analysis of similar
sections from mice injected with irrelevant primary antibody
yielded no ﬂuorescence staining. Second, proteins exposed to
the luminal surface of blood vessels of a mouse were labeled
using a biotinylation reagent injected through the tail vein
(Rajotte and Ruoslahti 1999). When the in vivo biotinylated
lung endothelial surface proteins were immunoprecipitated
with anti-Sfrs1, the precipitated Sfrs polypeptides can be de-
tected by peroxidase-conjugated avidin. Finally, as discussed
above, Sfrs1, Sfrs2, Sfrs5, and Sfrs7 bind to the carbohydrate
mimic, I-peptide. Mice were injected intravenously, ﬁrst with
anti-Sfrs antibodies and then followed by I-peptide displaying
phage particles (Fukuda et al. 2000). The binding of the I-
phage to the lung was inhibited by anti-Sfrs but not by control
normal goat immunoglobulin. All of these results indicate that
the SR proteins are expressed on the luminal cell surface of
lung capillaries.

With the discovery of Hatakeyama et al. (2009), the SR fam-
ily of splicing factors joins a surprisingly long and rapidly
growing list of diverse proteins that have been reported to ex-
hibit dual localization (Figure 2A and B), being found in both
the extracellular (cell surface and medium) and intracellular
(cytoplasm and nucleus) compartments of cells (Arnoys and
Wang 2007). The mechanism by which the SR proteins are ex-
ternalized, however, must be unusual inasmuch as there does
not appear to be a signal sequence to direct the polypeptide
into the endomembrane pathway for cell surface expression
and/or secretion. An unconventional secretion pathway has al-
so been postulated for the galectin family (Hughes 1999;
Nickel and Rabouille 2009), in which 10 of the members are
found outside of cells (Table II and Figure 2C) despite the fact
that the amino acid sequences of the polypeptides do not
exhibit an obvious signal sequence.

The literature on the galectins has been dominated by stud-
ies focused on their activity on the extracellular side (for
reviews, see Leﬄer et al. 2004 and Rabinovich et al. 2007).
The present essay will illustrate three salient features using Gal3
as an example. First, Gal3 binds to oligosaccharide structures on
cell surface or extracellular matrix proteins to modulate cell-
to-cell or cell-substrate adhesion. For example, Gal3 induces
neutrophil adhesion to laminin by bridging the cell surface
carbohydrates to the adhesive glycoprotein (Kuwabara and
Liu 1999). This kind of bridging function may be particularly
important in organogenesis. The extracellular matrix protein
hensin is responsible for the diﬀerentiation of a clonal, inter-
calated epithelial cell line to form columnar structures and
develop specialized apical membrane structures (microvilli)

and functions (regulated endocytosis or exocytosis). Upon ter-
minal diﬀerentiation, the epithelial cells externalize Gal3, which
bundles hensin to maintain polarity in the diﬀerentiated state
(Hikita et al. 2000).

Second, Gal3 binds to saccharide structures on certain cell
surface receptors, leading to their cross-linking and activation
which, in turn, induces signaling events and physiological re-
sponses from within the cell. The binding of Gal3 to CD98 on
the T-lymphocyte cell line Jurkat results in the uptake of extra-
cellular Ca2+ ions (Dong and Hughes 1996). It has been shown
that Gal3 binds to CD32 (the low-aﬃnity IgG receptor FcγRII)
on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and induces down-
regulation of the IL-5 gene (Cortegano et al. 2000). Gal3 also
binds to the high-aﬃnity IgE receptor FcεRI on mast cells
and a rat basophilic leukemia cell line, modulating the IgE-
dependent activation as assayed by degranulation and seroto-
nin release (Zuberi et al. 1994).

Finally, Gal3 at the cell surface appears to play a supportive
role in endocytosis by binding to cubilin, a ~400-kDa mem-
brane protein implicated as the endocytic receptor for a
variety of molecules (Crider-Pirkle et al. 2002). Interestingly,
cubilin is found only in perforin-containing granules of uterine
natural killer cells. By in situ hybridization, cubilin mRNA
could be found in the yolk sac epithelium but not in the uterine
natural killer cells. These results raise the possibility that yolk
sac-derived cubilin is endocytosed by uterine natural killer
cells via Gal3.

In the examples cited above to illustrate the three features of
the extracellular galectin activity, Gal3 acts as a soluble protein
binding to cell surface carbohydrates (Figure 2C). On the other

hand, the results of Hatakeyama et al. (2009) document SR
proteins as carbohydrate-speciﬁc receptors, responsible for
the sialyl LeX-dependent binding and lung colonization of
B16 melanoma cells. Using magnetic glyco-nanoparticles,
the binding of speciﬁc saccharides to the cell surface of various
cell types and tissues has been documented both in vitro and in
vivo via magnetic resonance imaging (van Kasteren et al.
2009; El-Boubbou et al. 2010). Although the identity of the
carbohydrate-binding protein(s) responsible for the recognition
of each of the speciﬁc glyco-nanoparticle has not been deﬁni-
tively established, the data are consistent with the possibility
that cell surface SR splicing factors, along with the well char-
acterized E-selectin, P-selectin, and mannose receptors, could
collectively contribute to the observed binding. This, in turn,
raises the question whether galectins might be cell-surface car-
bohydrate receptors as well (Figure 2D).

Partitioning between the nucleus and cytoplasm
Early immunoﬂuorescence studies localized Sfrs2 to the nucle-
oplasm (Table I and Figure 2A) as well as to discrete regions in
the nucleus, designated as speckles (Fu and Maniatis 1990).
More recent studies have shown that all SR protein family
members can be found in these speckles (Caceres et al 1997;
Sapra et al. 2009), which are thought to be sites to which fac-
tors involved in transcription and splicing coalesce for storage,
recycling, or reactivation during periods of less active tran-
scription (for a review on nuclear speckles, see Zhao et al
2009). Additional studies have shown that SR proteins move
to regions of active transcription and can be recruited to
nascent mRNPs as RNA polymerase II is elongating the
transcript (Misteli et al. 1997, 1998; Sapra et al. 2009). The
RS domain (or even a short stretch of RS dipeptides) is
suﬃcient for targeting to the nucleus; this is mediated by
transportin-SR, which shows sequence similarity to the nuclear
import receptors importin-α and importin-β (Caceres et al.
1997; Cazalla et al. 2002).

With the exception of Sfrs2, the SR splicing factors undergo
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Caceres et al. 1998), binding to
nascent, nuclear, and cytoplasmic mRNAs, suggesting a role
for SR protein members in the biogenesis and activities of var-
ious mRNPs (Sapra et al. 2009; Zhong et al. 2009). The
nuclear export of the SR proteins has been linked to mRNA
export due to the interaction between TAP, an RNA export fac-
tor, and some members (Sfrs1, 3, 7) of the SR protein family
(Huang et al. 2003). Hypophosphorylated Sfrs1 and 7 prefer-
entially bind to TAP, and this form of Sfrs1 can be found
associated with mature mRNPs (Huang et al. 2004; Lia and
Tarn 2004). Interestingly, a recent report has implicated argi-
nine methylation of Sfrs1 in the control of its subcellular
localization; Sfrs1 mutants that are unable to be methylated
and lack positive charge accumulate in the cytoplasm (Sinha
et al. 2010). In the cytoplasm, the SR proteins have been
shown to stimulate translation (Sanford et al. 2004, 2005),
and Sfrs1 has been shown to be polysome-associated (Sanford
et al. 2008).

Of the 15 galectins identiﬁed, 11 have been reported to be in
the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells (Table II and Figure 2D).
Several distinct activities have been reported for galectins in
the cytoplasm, including membrane anchorage of the H-Ras
oncogene product by Gal1 (Paz et al. 2001) and anti-apoptotic

SR proteins and galectins

activity of Gal3 (Yang et al. 1996). This diverse set of subjects
has been reviewed (Liu et al. 2002; Liu 2004), and the present
essay will focus only on those issues for which there is paral-
lelism with the SR splicing factors.

The nuclear versus cytoplasmic distribution reported for
each galectin most likely reﬂects the speciﬁc cell type and
experimental conditions (source of cells under study, culture
conditions, proliferation status of the cell/culture, or neoplastic
transformation). For example, Gal3 has been reported to be
exclusively cytoplasmic, predominantly nuclear, or distributed
between the two subcellular compartments (for a recent review,
see Haudek et al. 2010). In fact, Gal3 shuttles between the
cytoplasm and nucleus (Davidson et al. 2002), and an impor-
tin-α/β-mediated nuclear localization signal and an exportin-
1-mediated nuclear export signal have been identiﬁed on the
polypeptide (Davidson et al. 2006; Li et al. 2006; Nakahara
et al. 2006). In contrast to Sfrs1, in which a hypophosphory-
lated form is preferentially exported (Lia and Tarn 2004), it is
the phosphorylated form of Gal3 that is transported during
nuclear export (Tsay et al. 1999; Takenaka et al. 2004). On
this basis, there must be exquisite mechanisms by which Gal3
localization, transport, and association with distinct subcellular
components are regulated.

Like Sfrs2, Gal1 and Gal3 have been localized in the nu-
cleoplasm and in speckles under ﬂuorescence microscopy and
to corresponding structures by electron microscopy (Hubert
et al. 1995). In fact, double immunoﬂuorescence studies have
shown tight co-localization between Gal1, Gal3, and Sfrs2
(Vyakarnam et al. 1997, 1998). Particularly striking was the
observation that Gal3 in the nucleus was dependent on the in-
tegrity of ribonucleoprotein complexes (Laing and Wang 1988).
More recent studies have identiﬁed a Gal3-U1 small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which provides a mecha-
nism of incorporation of the galectin onto the pre-mRNA
splicing substrate (Haudek et al. 2009; see below).

Splicing of pre-mRNA
Since its initial discovery, Sfrs1 and the other members of the
SR protein family have been investigated intensely in terms of
their participation in splicing (for recent reviews, see Long and
Caceres 2009; Shepard and Hertel 2009; Zhong et al. 2009). In
contrast, much less work and much less information have been
accumulated for the galectins with regard to splicing. We will
restrict our discussion of the galectins to Gal1 and Gal3, the
two members that have been documented as splicing factors
(Dagher et al. 1995; Vyakarnam et al. 1997). This disparity
is opposite the situation with respect to carbohydrate-binding
activity, in which much more has been learned regarding the
galectins. Nevertheless, there appears to be signiﬁcant overlap
in terms of what we do know regarding the splicing activity of
the two protein families (Table III).
Using cell-free splicing assays,

the classic criteria of
depletion–reconstitution have established Gal1 and Gal3, as
well as all members of the SR family, as required factors in
splicing. In general, the SR splicing factors function in deﬁning
both the 5′- and 3′-splice sites and bridge factors assembled at
both sites to form stable complexes committed to the splicing
pathway. Many members of the SR protein family display a
redundant function in cell-free assays using standard pre-
mRNA substrates (Fu et al. 1992; Zamore et al. 1992; Wang

Fig. 3. Diagram illustrating the association of SR splicing factor(s) and galectin(s) with snRNPs and with the pre-mRNA substrate in the assembly of the
spliceosome. The pre-mRNA is shown on the left side as two rectangular exons joined by a single-line intron. The SR proteins, represented by Sfrs, can interact with the
pre-mRNA via its RNA recognition motif. Galectin-3 (Gal3) can enter the splicing pathway through its association with U1 snRNP, highlighted at the top on the
right side. The unmarked ovals represent other components of the splicing machinery. The left side highlights the fact that Sfrs and Gal3 are associated with the
pre-mRNA substrate from the early commitment complex through the active C complex, and the ﬁnal mature mRNA product. Both Sfrs and Gal3 are found as free
polypeptides as well as being associated with multiple snRNPs in larger complexes outside of the spliceosome, as schematically illustrated on the right side.

et al. 1996). However, individual SR proteins have distinct
speciﬁcity and eﬃciency in splicing diﬀerent pre-mRNA sub-
strates, and SR proteins are known to aﬀect splice site selection
in a concentration-dependent manner (see review by Long and
Caceres 2009).

Figure 3 highlights two important aspects of the association
of Gal1/Gal3 and the SR proteins with the splicing machinery.
First, members of both protein families are associated with the
pre-mRNA substrate from the early commitment complex to
the ﬁnal active C complex (reviewed by Wang et al. 2006;
Wahl et al. 2009), as depicted on the left side of the ﬁgure un-
der splicing complexes. Second, the right side of the ﬁgure
illustrates the fact that, in the absence of a pre-mRNA scaﬀold,
SR proteins and Gal3 can be found either as free protein or
in association with multiple ribonucleoprotein complexes,
including complexes containing all ﬁve snRNPs (Peng et al.
2006; Haudek et al. 2009). This is signiﬁcant because one

mechanism for the incorporation of Gal3 onto the forming
spliceosome is through its association with the U1 snRNP,
which recognizes the 5′-splice site of the pre-mRNA substrate
(Haudek et al. 2009).

Table III also highlights three diﬀerences between galectins
and the SR proteins. First, both domains of the SR protein in-
teract directly with the pre-mRNA splicing substrate (Hertel
and Graveley 2005), whereas it appears that neither Gal1 nor
Gal3 binds pre-mRNA directly (Wang et al. 2006). Second,
more than one SR family member can coexist on the same spli-
ceosome (Wahl et al. 2009), while it appears that Gal1 and
Gal3 assemble onto diﬀerent spliceosomes (Wang et al.
2006). Finally, the stability of the association of each family
with spliceosomes is very diﬀerent in terms of ionic strength.
Galectins can be released from spliceosomes at ~130 mM
salt (Wang et al. 2006), and the SR proteins remain associated
even when the salt concentration is 250 mM (Jurica et al. 2002;

1204

Zhou et al. 2002). The signiﬁcance of this disparate stability is
intriguing.

The comparisons between SR proteins and galectins in
Table III also pose questions that require future investigations.
First, Dagher et al. (1995) had documented that, in cell-free
assays, carbohydrate ligands of galectins inhibit splicing,
whereas non-binding saccharides failed to yield the same
eﬀect. Do saccharides that bind the SR proteins modulate
splicing in the cell-free assay (i.e. are the RNA-binding and
carbohydrate-binding activities mutually exclusive for SR
proteins)? Moreover, can saccharide ligands of both SR pro-
teins and galectins serve as endogenous splicing regulators in
intact cells? Second, site-directed mutants of Gal1, devoid of
carbohydrate-binding activity, retained the ability to reconsti-
tute splicing in a galectin-depleted nuclear extract, suggesting
that saccharide-binding, per se, is not required for the splic-
ing activity of galectins (Voss et al. 2008). Can the splicing and
carbohydrate-binding activities of the SR proteins be similarly
dissociated? Third, while SR proteins are known to be in-
volved in splice site selection and alternative splicing, the
question remains whether the splicing activity of the galectins
is restricted to constitutive splicing or broader in scope to in-
clude alternative splicing.

Summary and perspectives

The studies cited in the present review document that two dis-
tinct families of proteins share the following four properties:
(a) pre-mRNA splicing activity; (b) carbohydrate-binding
activity; (c) nuclear localization; and (d) cell surface expres-
sion. The SR proteins SF2/ASF and SC35 were so named
because they were initially discovered on the basis of their
splicing activity and localized to the nucleus (Figure 2A).
The surprise is the recent documentation of their carbohy-
drate-binding activity at the cell surface (Figure 2B). In
contrast, the galectins were initially puriﬁed on the basis of
their saccharide-binding activity and cell surface localization
(Figure 2C). The unexpected ﬁndings are their association
with the spliceosome in the nucleus (Figure 2D). Why have
the carbohydrate-binding domains and cell surface localization
properties of the two families been retained? Are the SR pro-
teins lectins disguised as splicing factors, and are the galectins
splicing factors masquerading as lectins? Is it just a coinci-
dence that these two conserved families share such properties
as carbohydrate-binding, cell surface localization, and splicing
activity? Really, what is in a name?
