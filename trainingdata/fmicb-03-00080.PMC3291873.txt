Surface components in fungal cells include cell wall molecules 
and, in certain cases, capsular structures (Figure 1) and extra-
cellular  matrix  components.  In  pathogens,  surface  molecules 
are responsible for key events during interaction with the host 
(Nimrichter et al., 2005). These events include recognition of 
pathogens by the immune system and generation of damage to 
host cells and tissues (Roeder et al., 2004). The molecular diver-
sity of surface structures in fungi is vast and may include (glyco)
proteins,  polysaccharides,  lipids,  and  pigments  (Nimrichter 
et al., 2005). Many of them have been associated with the anti-
fungal immune response, as well as with steps of fungal adhesion 
and dissemination during interaction with host cells. For many 
fungal  pathogens,  surface  composition  and  architecture  are 
determinant for either disease progression or control (Roeder 
et al., 2004; Nimrichter et al., 2005; Latgé, 2010; Figueiredo et al., 
2011). The diversity of the composition of the cell surface and 
its molecular architecture are believed to reveal targets for the 
action of new antifungals, as well as immunogens with potential 
to interfere with fungal diseases in favor of the host (Nimrichter 
et al., 2005).

In the Research Topic “Surface Architecture of Fungal Cells,” 
many of the important aspects related to structure and function 
of surface components of fungi were covered. It was, of course, 
impossible to discuss the same research topic for each important 
fungal pathogen. In addition, surface architecture of some of the 
most important fungal pathogens has been extensively reviewed 
before (Cassone, 1989; Poulain and Jouault, 2004; Ruiz-Herrera 
et al., 2006; Chaffin, 2008; Nather and Munro, 2008; Latgé, 2010). 
We therefore selected a group of pathogens as prototypes for the 
topic, and this list included Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma 
capsulatum,  Paracoccidioides  brasiliensis,  Sporothrix  schenckii, 
Pseudallescheria boydii, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumiga-
tus, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Components of the cell 
surface that were discussed in this topic included cell wall and 
capsular  polysaccharides  (Frases  et  al.,  2011;  Rodrigues  et  al., 
2011; Zaragoza, 2011), peptidopolysaccharides (Lopes-Bezerra, 
2011), proteins (Figueiredo et al., 2011; Guimaraes et al., 2011; 
Puccia et al., 2011), pigments (Zaragoza, 2011), and glycolipids 
(Barreto-Bergter et al., 2011; Nimrichter and Rodrigues, 2011). 
In  this  context,  articles  in  this  topic  were  focused  on  (i)  how 
fungal  molecules  are  assembled  at  the  cell  surface  (Guimaraes 
et  al.,  2011;  Lopes-Bezerra,  2011;  Nimrichter  and  Rodrigues, 
2011; Puccia et al., 2011; Zaragoza, 2011), (ii) how they impact

the immune response (Figueiredo et al., 2011; Guimaraes et al., 
2011;  Lopes-Bezerra,  2011;  Nimrichter  and  Rodrigues,  2011; 
Puccia et al., 2011; Rodrigues et al., 2011), (iii) the role of surface 
components in fungal physiology (Guimaraes et al., 2011; Lopes-
Bezerra, 2011; Nimrichter and Rodrigues, 2011; Puccia et al., 2011; 
Zaragoza, 2011), (iv) their potential to work as target for preven-
tive  or  therapeutic  agents  (Figueiredo  et  al.,  2011;  Guimaraes 
et al., 2011; Lopes-Bezerra, 2011; Nimrichter and Rodrigues, 2011; 
Puccia et al., 2011; Rodrigues et al., 2011), and (v) how to study 
structure and function of these molecules (Barreto-Bergter et al., 
2011; Frases et al., 2011). The extensive work of each contributor 
resulted in a clear notion that surface molecules of fungal cells are 
essential to fungal pathogenesis, physiology, and immune recogni-
tion. Essentially, these articles strongly indicate that knowledge 
on structure and functions of surface molecules in fungi can be 
translated soon into the discovery of new diagnostic, therapeutic, 
and preventive alternatives.
