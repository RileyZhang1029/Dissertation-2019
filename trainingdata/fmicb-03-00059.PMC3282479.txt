Post-transcriptional events which regulate mRNA biogenesis are fundamental to the control
of gene expression. A nascent mRNA is therefore steered through multimeric RNA–
protein complexes that mediate its capping, splicing, polyadenylation, nuclear export, and
ultimately its translation. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) mRNA trans-
port and accumulation protein, or ORF57, is a functionally conserved protein found in all
herpesviruses which plays a pivotal role in enhancing viral gene expression at a post-
transcriptional level. As such, ORF57 has been implicated in multiple steps of RNA bio-
genesis, including augmenting viral splicing, protecting viral RNAs from degradation to
enhancing viral mRNA nuclear export and translation. In this review, we highlight the
multiple roles of KSHV ORF57 in regulating the post-transcriptional events which are
fundamental to the control of virus gene expression.

KAPOSI’S SARCOMA-ASSOCIATED HERPESVIRUS
Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human
herpesvirus 8 is a gamma-2 herpesvirus associated with multiple
AIDS-related malignancies (Chang et al., 1994), including KS, a
highly vascular tumor of endothelial lymphatic origin (Ganem,
2006), and two lymphoproliferative disorders; primary effusion
lymphoma and multicentric Castleman’s disease (Chang et al.,
1994; Cesarman et al., 1995; Soulier et al., 1995). In sub-Saharan
Africa, widespread HIV infection has turned KS into an epidemic
disease and KS is now amongst the most common of all diag-
nosed malignancies (Parkin et al., 2008). Moreover, solid-organ
transplant recipients are at an increased risk of developing KS due
to a pre-existing infection or recipients being infected by donors
(Piselli et al., 2009).

Like other herpesviruses, KSHV has two distinct forms of infec-
tion, latency, and lytic replication (Ganem, 2006). However, in con-
trast to other oncogenic herpesviruses, where latent gene expres-
sion plays a prominent role in tumorigenesis, lytic replication plays
an important part in the tumorigenicity, pathogenesis, and spread
of KSHV infection (Cai et al., 2010). Speciﬁcally, lytic replica-
tion appears to be a necessary antecedent step in KS development
from the primary target of viral infection, the B lymphocyte reser-
voir, to endothelial cells where tumors are observed. Moreover,
lytic gene expression potentially contributes to the development
of KS through the expression of lytic viral proteins which medi-
ate paracrine secretion of growth and angiogenic factors that are
essential for tumor growth and development (Ballon et al., 2011;
Bottero et al., 2011). In addition, they sustain the population of
latently infected cells that would otherwise be reduced due to the
poor persistence of the KSHV episome during spindle cell divi-
sion (Grundhoff and Ganem, 2004). Therefore, it is essential to
study the molecular mechanisms which regulate lytic replication

to fully understand KSHV pathogenesis. This in turn may lead to
novel therapeutic interventions which could become an important
strategy for the treatment of KSHV-associated diseases.

Post-transcriptional events which regulate mRNA biogenesis
are fundamental to the control of gene expression. As a conse-
quence, cells have evolved a “gene expression production line”
that encompasses the routing of a nascent transcript through
multimeric mRNA–protein complexes that mediate its splic-
ing, polyadenylation, nuclear export, and translation (Hastings
and Krainer, 2001; Proudfoot, 2011; Rodríguez-Navarro and
Hurt, 2011). These pathways are particularly important for her-
pesviruses which replicate in the host cell nucleus and express
numerous lytic intronless mRNAs. Due to the reliance of her-
pesviruses on the host cell machinery for efﬁcient processing of
their mRNAs, an immediate issue arises concerning the mecha-
nism by which the viral intronless mRNAs are efﬁciently exported
from the nucleus, given that the majority of cellular bulk mRNA
nuclear export is intimately linked, and dependent upon, splicing
(Luo and Reed, 1999; Valencia et al., 2008).

To circumvent the problem associated with efﬁcient intron-
less viral mRNA nuclear export KSHV encodes a multifunctional
protein, the mRNA transport and accumulation (MTA) protein,
or ORF57, which functions in many aspects of RNA processing
(Malik et al., 2004b). Many of these properties are also con-
served in ORF57 homologs throughout herpesviruses including
HSV-1 ICP27; HSV-2 UL54; EBV SM/EB2; CMV UL69, VZV
ORF4, HHV-6 U42, HHV-7 U42, HVS ORF57 (Swaminathan,
2005; Boyne and Whitehouse, 2006a; Boyne et al., 2008a; Sandri-
Goldin, 2008; Toth and Stamminger, 2008; Ote et al., 2009). The
most widely characterized of these is the herpes simplex (HSV-1)
homolog ICP27, which has been used as a prototype for herpes
virus infection (Sandri-Goldin, 2008). Functionally, ORF57 and

KSHV ORF57 and mRNA biogenesis

FIGURE 1 | Putative motifs within the KSHV ORF57 protein. KSHV ORF57
is a 455 amino acid protein with an exon junction within the codon for aa 17.
The functional motifs comprise a putative CKII phosphorylation site (region
18–43); three nuclear localization signals (NLS1,2,3; regions 101–107, 121–131,
143–152); an A/T hook (region 119–131); two arginine–glycine–glycine motifs

(RGG1,2; regions 138–140, 372–374); a leucine zipper (region 343–364); a zinc
ﬁnger domain (region 423–432); and a hydrophobic
glycine–leucine–phenylalanine–phenylalanine motif (GLFF; region 448–451).
The putative phosphorylation sites were predicted using GPS V2.1 (Xue et al.,

its homologs regulate viral and cellular RNA processing, which
results in accumulation of target genes and may also contribute to
host cell shut-off (Hardwicke and Sandri-Goldin, 1994; Hardy and
Sandri-Goldin, 1994; Ruvolo et al., 1998; Whitehouse et al., 1998).
However, ORF57 homologs are evolutionarily diverged, with little
sequence conservation and have adapted into different roles in the
respective viruses. Therefore this review focuses on KSHV ORF57
and its role in the lytic replication cycle and mRNA processing.

THE KSHV ORF57 PROTEIN
ORF57 GENE AND PROTEIN STRUCTURE
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus lytic gene expression is
initiated by the immediate early protein the replication and tran-
scription activator, RTA, which is necessary and sufﬁcient for com-
plete reactivation into the lytic cascade (Lukac et al., 1998, 1999).
RTA functions as a viral transcription factor to initiate transcrip-
tion of various viral genes by multiple mechanisms (Dourmishev
et al., 2003). Interestingly, although RTA has been shown to be
able to recognize speciﬁc RTA response elements in promoters, it
activates the ORF57 promoter indirectly via an interaction with
RBP-Jκ (Liang et al., 2002; Chang et al., 2005). Additional cellular
cofactors including HMGB1 are also thought to be necessary for
efﬁcient RTA-mediated activation of the ORF57 promoter (Song
et al., 2004; Harrison and Whitehouse, 2008).

ORF57 is transcribed as a monocistronic pre-mRNA, contain-
ing a small intron comprising 109 nucleotides. It is interesting to
note that both RTA and ORF57, as immediate early proteins con-
tain introns enabling efﬁcient mRNA processing prior to ORF57
action on numerous delayed early and late intronless transcripts.
The ORF57 gene encodes a 455 aa protein, with only the ﬁrst
16 aa translated from the ﬁrst exon. Currently there are no solved
structures for KSHV ORF57 or any of its homologs, but com-
puter predictions indicate that the N-terminal region is mainly
unstructured, whereas the C-terminal domain forms primarily
alpha helices (Taylor et al., 2011). Nevertheless, several functional
regions have been identiﬁed (Figure 1).

Three nuclear localization signals (NLS) are located in the
N-terminal region of ORF57. Each NLS consists of a stretch of
basic residues and each individual NLS is sufﬁcient to localize
ORF57 into the nucleus. Mutation of any two of these NLS is
sufﬁcient to severely inhibit ORF57 function (Majerciak et al.,

FIGURE 2 | Cellular localization of KSHV ORF57. BCBL-1 cells were
reactivated with TPA to express the lytic KSHV genes. Cells were ﬁxed and
permeabilized and proteins immunostained using an ORF57-speciﬁc
antibody and a monoclonal antibody to C23 and FITC and Texas Red
secondary antibodies. ORF57 can be seen localizing in the nucleus, as well
as the nuclear speckles and colocalizing in the nucleolus with C23.

2006). Furthermore, it has been shown that these NLS also confer
nucleolar localization (Figure 2). Nucleolar trafﬁcking is thought
to be essential for KSHV ORF57 function, as well as the related
HVS ORF57 (Boyne and Whitehouse, 2006b, 2009), however as yet
the role of the nucleolus in ORF57 function is yet to be determined.
ORF57 binds to both viral and cellular target RNAs, for exam-
ple cellular IL-6 and viral vIL-6 have been shown to interact with
ORF57 using crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) assays
(Kang et al., 2011). Two RGG motifs, which are putative RNA
binding sites are found in ORF57. However, deletion of the ﬁrst
RGG motif has no effect on ORF57 RNA binding, while deletion of
the second C-terminal RGG motif results in a lack of RNA bind-
ing and consequently inefﬁcient nuclear export of a viral target
RNA. Although, this could be due to a deﬁciency in RNA bind-
ing or binding of cellular interacting proteins (Nekorchuk et al.,
2007). However, more recent evidence using site-directed mutants
of the RGG motifs suggests to defects in homodimerization and
intranuclear trafﬁcking of the RGG2 mutant (Taylor et al., 2011).
Interestingly, the N-terminal domain is also thought to be sufﬁ-
cient to bind RNA (Majerciak et al., 2006). A similar observation

has also been seen in the highly conserved Herpesvirus saimiri
ORF57 protein (Goodwin et al., 1999). Further work is neces-
sary to fully elucidate the ORF57 RNA binding domain or indeed
domains.

ORF57 also contains an uncharacterized AT-Hook motif. AT-
Hook motifs are generally found in DNA binding proteins and
are also found in a series of transcriptional cofactors (Aravind and
Landsman, 1998). ORF57 has been shown to bind directly to DNA,
with the AT-Hook domain implicated in this interaction (Palmeri
et al., 2007). EMSA-based analysis shows a deletion of the AT-Hook
region lead to a loss of ORF57 activation of the polyadenylated
nuclear RNA (PAN) promoter and diminished ability of ORF57 to
bind DNA. It is intriguing to note that ORF57 has been described
to act as a cofactor for RTA-mediated transactivation (Kirshner
et al., 2000), which will be discussed in more detail later. Addition-
ally, a putative leucine zipper domain is located in the C-terminal
domain of ORF57, however the function of this region is still
unclear. Although, a leucine rich region in the ORF57 homolog
ICP27 from HSV-1, has been shown to contain a functional nuclear
export signal (Sandri-Goldin, 1998). Together with the NLS, this
motif might therefore be responsible for the ability of ORF57 to
shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm (Bello et al., 1999).

Finally, the C-terminal domain of ORF57 also contains a zinc
ﬁnger domain and a GLFF motif. The zinc ﬁnger domain is con-
served throughout ORF57 homologs whereas the GLFF motif is
restricted to gamma-herpesviruses (Goodwin et al., 2000). The
functional relevance of the zinc ﬁnger domain of KSHV ORF57
is not fully characterized, however work on HSV-1 ICP27 high-
lighted a potential role in dimerization and binding of the nuclear
export factor TAP (Hernandez and Sandri-Goldin, 2010, 2011).
The GLFF motif plays a role in transactivation as well as repres-
sion properties of the HVS ORF57 protein and SM protein in EBV,
however, again no role has been shown in KSHV to date (Goodwin
et al., 2000; Ruvolo et al., 2004).

cleavage event to prevent full lytic reactivation in the majority of
cells maintaining the large latent pool of infected cells.

THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL ROLES OF ORF57 IN mRNA
BIOGENESIS
THE ROLE OF ORF57 IN SPLICING
The mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing and the function of ORF57
and its homologs is closely linked. For example, HSV-1 ICP27
effectively inhibits splicing to reduce host cell gene expression,
thereby eliciting a host cell shut-off (Smith et al., 2005). This is
mediated by an interaction between ICP27 and SAP145, an essen-
tial pre-mRNA splicing factor (Bryant et al., 2001). No such effect
has been reported for KSHV ORF57 to date, as KSHV encodes
a number of spliced transcripts. On the contrary, KSHV ORF57
is able to enhance splicing of a number of viral genes (Majerciak
et al., 2008). This enhancement effect on splicing is not limited
to KSHV genes as a similar enhancement has been observed on
non-viral mRNA constructs. ORF57 was able to enhance splicing
of reporter constructs which are normally only poorly spliced due
to a large exon prior to the spliced intron. ORF57 forms a com-
plex with the spliceosome, as demonstrated by association with the
small spliceosomal RNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6), as well as the
splicing factors SF2/ASF and U2AF (Majerciak et al., 2008). Inter-
estingly, association of ORF57 with unspliced pre-mRNA could
only be observed in the presence of nuclear extract and not puriﬁed
ORF57, indicating that the association with pre-mRNA is indirect
and ORF57 is acting as a modulator of normal splicing rather than
directly recruiting splicing factors to the mRNA. A similar effect
has since also been reported for the EBV homolog of ORF57, SM,
which acts as an alternative splicing factor, inﬂuencing the choice
of splice site (Verma and Swaminathan, 2008). To this end, SM has
been reported to interact directly with SRp20 (Verma et al., 2010)
however it remains to be determined whether the same is true for
KSHV ORF57.

CASPASE-7 CLEAVAGE OF ORF57
An interesting recent study presented a hypothesis for a possible
cellular mechanism against lytic KSHV virus infection (Majer-
ciak et al., 2010). The authors showed that infection with KSHV
or reactivation into the lytic cycle induces the caspase-8 mediated
apoptosis pathway. This leads to the expression of caspase-7 which
was shown to cleave ORF57 33 amino acids from the N-terminus.
This cleaved form of ORF57 has been shown to be deﬁcient in
its functional roles of viral mRNA maturation and processing.
Furthermore, cells expressing caspase-7 showed little lytic reac-
tivation and underwent caspase-induced apoptosis, whereas cells
expressing full-length ORF57 appeared to show diminished activ-
ity of caspase-7 and were able to enter into a full lytic cycle. The
mechanisms underlying this delicate balancing act are yet to be
deﬁned, but understanding how caspase-7 is suppressed in a num-
ber of lytically active cells, and how caspase-8 is induced leading to
apoptosis in the remainder of cells presents an interesting scenario
for a potential antiviral mechanism against KSHV. It is, however,
possible that this cleavage is simply a neutral event, or perhaps
even beneﬁcial to the virus. For example, KSHV could utilize
this as a post-translational mechanism to control ORF57 activ-
ity. Alternatively, it maybe possible that the virus could utilize this

Spicing of cellular mRNAs is intrinsically linked to a number
of upstream and downstream processes, including transcription,

end formation, mRNA export, RNA stability, and translation
(Moore and Proudfoot, 2009). This link is due to the recruitment
of numerous proteins to an mRNA during the splicing process.
One such complex of proteins is the human transport/export
(hTREX) complex which comprises multiple proteins including
UAP56, Aly, the multi-protein THO complex, and the recently dis-
covered Tex1 and CIP29 (Masuda et al., 2005; Dufu et al., 2010).
(cid:2)
hTREX is deposited onto the 5
end of the mRNA in a splicing-
dependent manner through an interaction between Aly and the
cap-binding complex (Cheng et al., 2006). Aly then recruits the
remainder of the hTREX complex before interacting with the
nuclear export receptor protein, TAP. The handover from Aly to
TAP is promoted by arginine methylation of Aly within its TAP and
RNA binding domains (Hung et al., 2010). Methylation of these
sites reduces the RNA binding afﬁnity of Aly and allows TAP to
efﬁciently displace Aly during the export process. TAP then inter-
acts with nucleoporins to facilitate the transport of the mRNP
through the nuclear pore (Kohler and Hurt, 2007). However,
whilst understanding of the export of intron-containing genes has

KSHV ORF57 and mRNA biogenesis

increased signiﬁcantly over recent years, the mechanisms underly-
ing intronless cellular mRNA export are poorly understood. This
is of particular interest with regards to ORF57 as numerous KSHV
mRNAs are intronless. However, a recent study has identiﬁed that
some intronless cellular mRNAs can also be exported by hTREX
and TAP, increasing our understanding of how intronless mRNAs
are processed (Lei et al., 2011).

A pivotal function of ORF57 in viral mRNA metabolism is its
role in nuclear export of viral mRNA. To efﬁciently export viral
intronless mRNAs from the nucleus ORF57 is able to recruit the
entire hTREX complex to intronless viral mRNAs (Boyne et al.,
2008b; Tunnicliffe et al., 2010). ORF57 is able to bind directly to the
RNA and recruit the export adapter, Aly to the 5
end of the RNA,
bypassing the requirement for splicing-dependent recruitment of
Aly. Aly then recruits the remainder of the hTREX complex as well
as TAP to form an export competent viral RNP which then allows
efﬁcient translocation through the nuclear pore complex. This
function is also conserved in the HVS ORF57 homolog (Colgan
et al., 2009).

(cid:2)

However, a long-standing conundrum with this model has been
the role of the exporter adapter Aly. Surprisingly, depletion studies
in both mammalian and viral systems show that Aly is dispens-
able for mRNA export. The explanation for this appears to lie
in an apparent redundancy in the eukaryotic hTREX components;
speciﬁcally due to the discovery of a second export adapter protein,
UAP56 interacting factor (UIF; Hautbergue et al., 2009). UIF binds
to the mRNA in a splicing-independent reaction and is recruited
to the mRNA via a direct interaction with the histone chaperone
FACT. UIF can then interact with TAP to facilitate delivery of the
mRNA to the nuclear pore. To this end, ORF57 is now known to
interact directly with both Aly and UIF and to recruit the entire
hTREX complex through these interactions (Jackson et al., 2011),
as well as interacting with other cellular factors such as RBM15 and
OTT3 (Majerciak et al., 2011; Figure 3). While our understanding
of the proteins involved in the export of intronless KSHV mRNAs
has improved, the exact mechanism remains elusive. For exam-
ple, it has been demonstrated that ORF57 interacts directly with
UIF and Aly, but it is not known whether these interactions occur
simultaneously or independent of one another. siRNA depletion of
both Aly and UIF is sufﬁcient to severely impair ORF57-mediated
mRNA export. However, depletion of Aly and UIF individually
also causes a slight decrease in the level of mRNA export, perhaps
suggesting that both proteins are required simultaneously for the
efﬁcient export KSHV mRNAs.

THE ROLE OF ORF57 IN mRNA STABILITY
Another major role of KSHV ORF57 is to enhance RNA stabil-
ity. Multiple studies have shown that a series of KSHV mRNAs
are stabilized by ORF57 (e.g., ORF47, ORF59, and PAN), whereas
others show no dependence on ORF57 (e.g., GCR and K5), sug-
gesting that a speciﬁc RNA motif may be recognized by ORF57
to enhance the stability of target mRNAs (Kirshner et al., 2000;
Boyne et al., 2008b). Recent analysis has now shed light on a
possible ORF57 response element (ORE), although to date infor-
mation is mainly limited onto the KSHV PAN. An ORE has been
identiﬁed in the 5
end of PAN and further analysis showed that
the transfer of this element confers ORF57 responsiveness to an

intronless viral mRNA nuclear export. ORF57 binds to intronless viral
mRNA in the nucleus and interacts directly with the export adapters Aly and
UIF. Via the interaction with one or both of these export adapters ORF57
can then recruit the remainder of the hTREX complex, including the
proteins UAP56 and the THO complex as well as the export receptor, TAP.
ORF57 shuttles this complex through the nucleolus prior to the mRNA
being exported into the cytoplasm in a TAP-dependent mechanism. The
hTREX components are then recycled back into the nucleus while ORF57
remains bound to the viral mRNA for involvement in further downstream
mechanisms.

intronless reporter construct (Sei and Conrad, 2011). Deletion and
mutational mapping have demonstrated that a nine nucleotide
long core sequence is essential for the binding of ORF57 to PAN.
A similar response element was independently conﬁrmed, how-
ever the suggested minimal element of nine nucleotides is one
position shifted compared to the sequence identiﬁed by Sei and
Conrad (Massimelli et al., 2011). The binding of ORF57 to PAN
via this RNA sequence is believed to enhance PAN RNA stabil-
ity. In addition, two further proteins have been shown to interact
with the ORF57 binding sequence, namely PABPC1 and EIB-AP5
(Massimelli et al., 2011). As the PABPC1 binding to the ORE is
ORF57-dependent and speciﬁc to this binding site, it has been
suggested that PABPC1 recruitment might be involved in stabiliz-
ing the PAN RNA in an ORF57-dependent manner (Massimelli
et al., 2011; Figure 4).

An additional ORE has been identiﬁed within the KSHV vIL-6
mRNA (Kang et al., 2011). This sequence however only shares
a 4-bp core (GGAU) with the PAN minimal ORE. Interest-
ingly, investigations of ORF57 binding to this ORE highlighted
a mechanism by which ORF57 stabilizes and protects vIL-6 from
miRNA-mediated degradation. ORF57 protects the mRNA from
degradation by a miRNA by a competitive binding mechanism.
Moreover, the cellular IL-6 is also protected by ORF57 binding
from the action of a second miRNA. How the other ORF57 tar-
get mRNAs are recognized remains still unclear, but considering
the pace of recent ﬁndings, a better understanding of the underly-
ing mechanism of ORF57 RNA binding and RNA stability seems
closer than ever.

PAN RNA in the nucleus. ORF57 binds to the ORF57 response element
(ORE) in the 5(cid:2) of the KSHV PAN RNA, stabilizing PAN, and increasing
expression. Additionally, ORF57 is able to redistribute PABPC1 to the

explaining the stabilizing ability of the ORF57–PABPC1 interaction on PAN
RNA.

FIGURE 5 | Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ORF57 enhances
the translation of intronless viral mRNAs. As well as interacting with the
hTREX complex in the nucleus, ORF57 also binds directly to the cellular
protein PYM and recruits it to intronless KSHV mRNAs. ORF57 then
shuttles through the nucleolus in an mRNP complex with the hTREX
components, the intronless viral mRNA, PYM, and possibly other factors
before exporting the mRNA. PYM recruits the 48S preinitiation complex to
the viral mRNA, enhancing the pioneer round of translation in an
ORF57-dependent manner.

ORF57 FUNCTIONS TO ENHANCE THE TRANSLATION OF VIRAL
TRANSCRIPTS
The multistep processes of mRNA biogenesis and maturation are
not limited to the mechanisms that take place in the nucleus.
A major protein complex deposited onto cellular mRNA during
splicing is the exon junction complex (EJC; Bono and Gehring,
2011). The EJC is deposited ∼20 nts upstream of every exon–exon
junction of spliced mRNA. The EJC functions in nonsense medi-
ated decay targeting aberrant mRNAs which contain premature
stop codons (Chang et al., 2007). In addition, the EJC plays a criti-
cal role in enhancing the translation of cellular mRNA transcripts,
although the mechanisms by which it achieves this process have
only been recently elucidated. It is believed that the EJC interacts
with multiple translational enhancement proteins. For example,
the EJC associated SKAR is able to recruit the 40S ribosomal sub-
unit S6 protein kinase 1 (S6K1) to newly synthesized mRNA. This
recruitment of S6K1 leads to an mTORC1 signaling cascade that
results in enhancement of the pioneer round of translation (Ma
et al., 2008). Additionally, the cellular protein PYM is able to bind
to the EJC proteins Y14 and Magoh. PYM is then able to interact
with the 48S preinitiation complex through a direct interaction
with the small ribosomal subunit. This recruitment of the 48S
preinitiation complex by PYM then acts to enhance the pioneer
round of translation of cellular mRNAs (Diem et al., 2007).

Analysis of the complexes recruited to a viral mRNA by ORF57
has shown that ORF57 only recruits hTREX components to
viral intronless mRNAs, not EJC components, which leads to
the intriguing question of how the viral transcripts are efﬁ-
ciently translated, when lacking an EJC. The answer lies in that
ORF57 is able to enhance translation of viral transcripts itself.
To this end, ORF57 interacts directly with PYM in vitro and

in vivo, bypassing the need for PYM to interact with the EJC,
and recruit the 48S preinitiation complex to intronless KSHV
mRNAs (Figure 5; Boyne et al., 2010a,b). The functional impor-
tance of the PYM–ORF57 interaction was conﬁrmed through
in vivo use of transdominant mutants of PYM lacking the C-
and N-terminal domains that are essential for the interaction
of PYM with both the EJC and the 48S preinitiation complex.
Importantly, these transdominant PYM mutants are still able to
interact with ORF57 and expression in vivo alongside ORF57 dra-
matically reduced expression levels of late KSHV proteins and,
concurrently KSHV virion production highlighting the impor-
tance of the KSHV ORF57–PYM interaction for enhancement of
KSHV mRNA translation.

To date no other ORF57 homolog has been shown to interact
with PYM to enhance translation by a similar method, although
translational enhancement is not something that is unique to
KSHV ORF57. The ICP27 protein of HSV-1 has been shown to
enhance the translation of several late proteins including VP16
and ICP5 (Fontaine-Rodriguez and Knipe, 2008), although the
mechanism of this enhancement has not yet been deﬁned. Inter-
estingly, ICP27 does not affect the translation of all HSV-1 proteins
as protein levels of the viral glycoprotein gD are not affected by the
presence of ICP27, suggesting that whatever translational enhance-
ment effect ICP27 is having, it is not a global effect on all mRNAs.
Similarly, the SM protein of EBV has been shown to enhance trans-
lation of intronless viral transcripts. Moreover, insertion of an
intron into intronless EBV viral transcripts negated the require-
ment for SM for efﬁcient export and translation (Ricci et al., 2009).
One possible explanation for this is that SM functions in a similar

manner to KSHV ORF57 and recruits translational enhancement
proteins. Therefore inserting an artiﬁcial intron allows the for-
mation of an EJC which can recruit PYM independently of SM
thereby enhancing the translation of viral transcripts.

A POSSIBLE ROLE FOR ORF57 IN TRANSCRIPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT
The roles of ORF57 are not limited to post-transcriptional
processes; ORF57 also interacts with the KSHV transcriptional
activator, RTA (Malik et al., 2004a). RTA can transactivate a
number of KSHV and cellular promoters by binding directly to
promoter regions containing an RTA responsive element (RRE) or
interact with other transcriptional control proteins (Dourmishev
et al., 2003). Alternatively, RTA can target transcriptional repres-
sors for degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway
through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Yu et al., 2005; Gould et al.,
2009). Importantly, ORF57 has been shown to interact directly
with RTA through its N-terminal region and through this inter-
action synergistically transactivates a number of viral promoters,
including its own promoter as well as promoters for PAN/nut-1,
Kaposin, ori-Lyt (L), K-bZIP, and TK (Kirshner et al., 2000; Malik
et al., 2004a; Palmeri et al., 2007).

The A/T hook domain in the ORF57 N-terminus has been
shown to confer a DNA binding ability on ORF57, although dele-
tion of this domain did not completely abrogate DNA binding
(Palmeri et al., 2007). Moreover, ORF57 was able to transacti-
vate the PAN/nut-1 promoter irrespective of whether there was
an intact A/T hook domain. Furthermore, ORF57 has also been
shown to have a low transactivation effect on other viral promot-
ers, such as Kaposin and TK in the absence of RTA (Kirshner
et al., 2000). However, transactivation by ORF57 in the context
of a lytic infection appears to be dependent on the ORF57–RTA
interaction (Malik et al., 2004a). Additionally, transactivation by
the ORF57–RTA complex appears to be promoter-, transcript-,
and cell line-speciﬁc (Palmeri et al., 2007). Spontaneous KSHV
reactivation in lytic cells is an inefﬁcient process that is limited by
the expression of RTA. It is interesting to note that ORF57 is able
to enhance the expression of RTA in vivo, and one possibility is
that activation of the RTA promoter by the ORF57–RTA complex
is one mechanism by which KSHV overcomes the initial hurdle of
inefﬁcient reactivation.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
A number of recent studies have highlighted that ORF57 and its
homologs are highly multifunctional with major roles in tran-
scriptional activation, splicing, RNA stability, RNA nuclear export,
and translational enhancement. The key function of this family of
proteins, conserved amongst all α-, β-, and γ-herpesviruses, is the
enhancement of viral mRNA transcript accumulation, although
different homologs may have alternative ways they perform this
function, as well as additional roles they play within the viral
lifecycle.

A major question yet to be answered is how the multifunc-
tional aspects of ORF57 are controlled. As all ORF57 homologs
are designated as S/R proteins it seems highly likely that they are
heavily posttranslationally modiﬁed, perhaps by multiple modiﬁ-
cations. The ORF57 homolog of CMV, UL69, has been shown to
be phosphorylated by CDKs, and colocalizes with CDK9 (Rechter

et al., 2009). Inhibiting CDK activity in cell culture affects the
nuclear localization of UL69 and causes it to form aggregates
within the nucleus. Moreover, KSHV ORF57 is known to inter-
act with the major cellular kinase, casein kinase II, and has been
shown to be phosphorylated (Malik and Clements, 2004). This
phosphorylation regulates the interaction between ORF57 and the
cellular protein hnRNP K, a multifunctional protein involved in
regulating gene expression. However, ORF57 has multiple protein
partners, both cellular and viral, the majority of which presum-
ably have their interaction controlled by some form of post-
translational modiﬁcation. Further analysis of which residues of
ORF57 are phosphorylated, and what effect this has on the vari-
ous protein–protein interactions, as well as export and import of
ORF57, is therefore essential to understanding how the multiple
roles of ORF57 are controlled. Moreover, arginine methylation
is known to affect protein import and export within the cell
as well as protein–protein interactions. The HSV-1 ICP27 pro-
tein has recently been shown to be methylated on three residues
within its RGG box (Souki and Sandri-Goldin, 2009; Souki et al.,
2009), and that this methylation affected the interaction between
ICP27 and the cellular proteins Aly and SRPK1, as well as reg-
ulating its export; although import of ICP27 into the nucleus
is not affected by methylation. It is therefore important to test
whether KSHV ORF57 is methylated in a similar way within
either RGG1 or RGG2, and what effect any potential methyla-
tion has on its function. Additionally, a protein-wide screen of
which, if any, ORF57 residues are methylated could lead to an
understanding of how various ORF57 interactions and functions
are coordinated.

It is clear from recent data from a number of independent
research groups that ORF57 binds speciﬁcally to PAN RNA in con-
junction with PABPC1 to stabilize PAN and increase its expression
(Borah et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2011; Massimelli et al., 2011;
Sei and Conrad, 2011). However, one major unanswered ques-
tion relating to this is why does ORF57 stabilize PAN? It would
be interesting to see in the context of the virus what effect a PAN
lacking the MRE would have on virus replication. Presumably,
as PAN constitutes ∼80% of all polyadenylated RNA in a KSHV
lytically active cell, the binding to PAN is an important aspect
of ORF57 function. Furthermore, the understanding of ORF57
RNA binding is currently very limited with little awareness of
how ORF57 is able to distinguish between cellular and viral tran-
scripts, as well as the mechanistic way in which ORF57 recognizes
and binds to the RNA. Answering these questions is vital to con-
tinue our understanding of the role of ORF57 in viral mRNA
biogenesis.

Current understanding of the mechanisms involved in both
viral and cellular mRNA biogenesis is still in its infancy. The func-
tion of some of the key proteins in mRNA export, such as the THO
complex, is still poorly understood, as is the way that mRNA is sta-
bilized both by cellular and viral mechanisms. Elucidation of the
functions that ORF57 has and the roles it plays in various aspects of
mRNA biogenesis will not only improve our understanding of viral
mechanisms, but it will act as a model for the wider ﬁeld of RNA
biogenesis and processing. Moreover, from a clinical perspective
a major difference between KSHV and the other human onco-
genic herpesviruses is that KSHV requires reactivation and lytic

expression for the majority of its tumorigenic properties. For this
reason, studying the switch between latency and lytic replication
is essential for both fully understanding the mechanism of KSHV
tumorigenesis and also for developing treatments to prevent the
onset or spread of KSHV-associated malignancies. Therefore, the
study and understanding of the immediate early proteins that con-
trol this latent–lytic switch, including ORF57, is paramount for the
future development of novel KSHV therapeutics.
