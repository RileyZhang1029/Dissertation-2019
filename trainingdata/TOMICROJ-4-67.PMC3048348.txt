Abstract:  An  extracellular  protease  was  purified  from  Pseudomonas  thermaerum  GW1  a  new  strain  identified  by  
morphological, biochemical  and 16S rDNA  sequencing. It was isolated  from  soil of Poultry waste  site at Ghazipur near 
Ghaziabad, Delhi. The strain produces extra cellular protease in the culture media that was maintained at 37°C, 140 rpm. 
The media was harvested for protease after 48 hrs of incubation at 37°C in basal media supplemented with 1% casein. We 
report 6.08 fold purification of enzyme following ammonium sulphate precipitation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. 
The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be approximately 43,000 daltons as shown by casein zymography 
studies. The optimum pH for the proteolytic activity was pH 8.0 and enzyme remained stable between pH 5 -11 at 60°C. 
Interestingly  Mn2+  (5mM)  activated  enzyme  activity  by  5  fold,  while  Cu2+,  Mg2+and  Ca2+  moderately  activated  enzyme 
activity, where  as Zn2+, Fe2+ and Hg2+ inhibited  enzyme  activity.  The protease produced was  stable in presence of 50 % 
(v/v)  ethylacetate  and  acetone.  Isopropanol,  methanol  and  benzene  increased  protease  activity  by  2.7,  1.3  and  1.1  fold  
respectively but was inhibited in presence of glycerol and DMSO. This organic solvent-stable protease could be used as a 
biocatalyst for enzymatic peptide synthesis

INTRODUCTION 

 
Proteases  covers  up  to  60%  of  total  enzyme  market  and 
are  valuable  commercial  enzyme  that  have  biotechnological 
as well as industrial applications however the present known 
proteases  are  not  sufficient  to  meet  most  of  the  industrial 
demands  It  is  desirable  to  have  new  proteases  with  novel 
properties  from  different  sources.  Alkaline  proteases  hold  a 
great  potential  for  application  in  the  detergent  and  leather 
industries  [1-3]  and  are  also  reported  to  have  been  isolated 
from microbes, plants and animals. 

 
Proteases  from  plant  sources  have  application  in  food 
industry  [4].  Previous  studies  in  our  lab  have  shown  that 
proteases from senesced leaves of Lantana camara can have 
application in detergent industry as the enzyme is thermosta-
ble  [5].  Microbes  are  the  preferred  source  of  proteases  
because  of  their  rapid  growth,  and  the  ease  with  which  
they  can  be  genetically  manipulated  to  generate  new  
enzymes  with  altered  properties  [6,  7].  Proteases  have  
been purified and characterized from several bacteria [8-12]. 
However  there  are  only  few  reports  on  Pseudomonas  
thermaerum,  Yang  et  al.,  [13]  have  identified  two  strains  of 
Psudomonas thermaerum isolated from activated sludge that 
could  use  lignin  as  sole  carbon  source  and  excrete  peroxi-
dases. A novel antimicrobial peptide (30 kDa) produced by a 
this  bacterium  isolated  from  the  effluent  pond  of  a  bovine 
abattoir  showed  inhibition  to  a  broad  range  of  indicator

strains, including pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria such 
as  Listeria monocytogenes,  Bacillus cereus,  Staphylococ-
cus aureus  has  been  reported  by Fontoura  et  al.,  [14].  The 
partially  purified  antimicrobial  substance  remained  active 
over  a  wide  temperature  range  and  was  resistant  to  all  
proteases.  S28  strain  isolated  from  Nanyang  oil  field  was 
identified to be as P. thermaerum based on homology studies 
and  could  degrade  82.02%  of  phenenthrene  within  10  days 
[15]. 

 
In  our  attempt  to  screen  for  microbial  isolate  that  can 
provide  stable  enzyme,  soil  sample  of  the  poultry  waste  site 
which is rich in organic waste was selected. In this investiga-
tion, we report the production and effect of pH, temperature, 
metal  ions  and  substrate  concentration  on  protease  secretion 
whereby  the  culture  condition  were  manipulated  for  maxi-
mum  protease  production.  Pseudomonas  thermareum  GW1 
was isolated from soil of poultry waste site and it extracellu-
larly secreted this protease which was purified to homogene-
ity,  characterized  and  found  to  be  stable  in  the  presence  of 
several  organic  solvents.  Ours  is  the  first  report  that  shows 
extracellular  production  of  proteases  from  Pseudomonas 
thermaerum GW1 strain. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Isolation and Screening of Protease-Producing Strains 

Soil  was  collected 

 
in  sterilized  sampling  bags  of 
Ghazipur  poultry  waste  site,  India.  The  microbe  responsible 
for the production of protease was identified. The classifica-
tion  was  based  on  gram  strain  (-),  catalase  (+)  and  oxidase 
(+) 
reactions,  using  morphological  and  biochemical

characteristics  based  on  Bergey’s  Manual  of  Determinative 
Bacteriology  [16].  Soil  was  selected  from  areas  where  
naturally  degraded  feather  were  seen.  The  samples  were 
brought  to  the  laboratory  and  processed  for  the  analysis  the 
same  day.  Soil  samples  were  suspended  in  basal  media  and 
kept for growth at 37°C for 6 days. At regular  intervals of 6 
hrs  the  activity  of  protease  was  measured  and  sample  
showing  maximum  activity  was  screened  for  protease  
producing  strains.  Samples  of  repeated  batch  cultures  were 
plated on skim  milk agar. After 24–48 hrs at 37°C, colonies 
which  exhibited  the  largest  cleared  zones  were  selected  and 
was further  incubated  in cultivation media for further 48 hrs 
and checked for protease production. 

Identification of Protease Producing Bacteria 

  The  isolate  GW1  was  identified  originally  as  a  strain  of 
Pseudomonas  by  our  laboratory  based  on  Morphological, 
Physical,  Biochemical  characteristics  and  the  single  colony 
was  subcultured  on  bacterial  culture  plates  supplemented 
with  casein.  The  culture  was  sent  for  identification  till  
species level to Bangalore GeneI India by partial 16S r DNA 
sequence analysis.  

Production of Enzyme in Cultivation Media 

  The  Basal  media  for  protease  production  composed  of  
(g L-1): Peptone, 5; Glucose, 10; NaCl, 0.5; CaCl2.2H2O, 0.1; 
K2HPO4,  0.3;  KH2PO4,  0.4;  MgSO4  ·  7H2O,  0.1;  and  yeast 
extract,  5.  The  pH  was  maintained  at  7.5.  Microbes  were 
allowed to grow in 500 ml conical flask containing 50 ml of 
the  culture  media  that  was  maintained  at  37°C  at  140  rpm. 
5% (v/v) of the 20 hrs old culture was inoculated  in cultiva-
tion media [17]. 

i  Tryptic soy broth (TSB)  

ii  Gelatin (1%) + basal medium for protease production  

iii  Casein (1%)+ basal medium for protease production  

iv  Skim  milk  powder  (1%)+ basal  medium  for  protease 

production 

v  Pigeon  feathers  (1%)+ basal  medium  for  protease  pro-

duction  

  The  above  cultivation  media  were  checked  for  enzyme 
activity  at regular intervals of 6 hrs by the  modified method 
of Tsuchida et al. [18].  

Protease Purification 

  The  bacterial  strain  was  grown  for  48  hrs  at  37°C  in  the 
selected  cultivation  media.  The  culture  medium  was  
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and the cell-free 
supernatant was precipitated with 0-60% ammonium sulfate. 
The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved 
in a small volume (1/50) of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 
and dialyzed against 4 liters of same buffer for 12 hrs at 4°C. 
This step was repeated  twice. The dialyzed enzyme prepara-
tion  was  applied  on  a  DEAE-cellulose  column  (2  X  24  cm) 
pre-equilibrated  with  10  mM  Tris-HCl  (pH  8.0).  The  unad-
sorbed protein fraction was eluted with the same buffer (150 
ml).  The  enzyme  was  eluted  with  a  gradient  of  2mM  and  4 

Gaur et al. 

mM  NaCl  in  the  same  buffer  at  a  flow  rate  of  1ml/min.  
Active fractions that contained (80%) of the enzyme activity 
were pooled, and subsequently used for characterization. All 
steps were conducted at 4°C. 

Determination of Protease Activity 

 
Protease  activity  was  assayed  by  a  modified  method  of 
Tsuchida  et  al.  [18]  by  using  casein  as  substrate.  100  μl  of 
enzyme solution was added to 900 μl of substrate solution (2 
mg/ml (w/v)  casein in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer, pH 8.0).The 
mixture  was  incubated  at  45°C  for  30  min.  Reaction  was 
terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 10% (w/v) 
chilled  trichloroacetic  acid  then  the  reaction  mixture  was 
allowed to stand in ice for 15 min to precipitate the insoluble 
proteins.  The  supernatant  was  separated  by  centrifugation  at 
10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C; the acid soluble product in the 
supernatant  was  neutralized  with  5  ml  of  0.5  M  Na2CO3  
solution. The colour developed after adding 0.5 ml of 3-fold-
diluted  Folin–Ciocalteau  reagent  was  measured  at  660  nm. 
All  assays  were  done  in  triplicate.  One  protease  unit  is  
defined  as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 (cid:1)g of tyro-
sine per ml per minute under the above assay conditions. The 
specific  activity  is  expressed  in  the  units  of  enzyme  activity 
per milligram of protein. 

Protein Concentration 

Protein  concentration  was  determined  by  the  method  of 

 
Bradford [19] with bovine serum albumin as standard.  

Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Zymogram 

 
SDS-PAGE was performed on a slab gel containing 10% 
(w/v)  polyacrylamide  by  the  method  of  Laemmli  [20].  
Casein  zymography  was  performed  in  polyacrylamide  slab 
gels  containing  SDS  and  casein  (0.12%  w/v)  as  co-
polymerized  substrate,  as described by  Choi et al., [21]. Af-
ter  electrophoresis,  the  gel  was  incubated  for  30  minutes  at 
room  temperature  on  a  gel  rocker  in  50  mM  Tris-Cl  (pH 
7.4),  which  contained  2.5%  Triton  X-100  to  remove  SDS. 
The  gel  was  then  incubated  in  a  zymogram  reaction  buffer 
(30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl and 10 mM CaCl2) 
left at 37°C for 12 hrs on rocker shaker.The gel was stained 
with  Coomassie  brilliant  blue  (0.5%  w/v)  for  30  min.  The 
activity  band  was  observed  as  a  clear  colourless  area  
depleted  of  casein  in  the  gel  against  the  blue  background 
when  destained  in  10%  methanol  and  5%  acetic  acid  for  a 
limited period of time.  

Effect of pH on Enzyme Activity 

  Effect  of  pH  on  the  purified  enzyme  activity  was  meas-
ured at various pH ranges (3.0 – 12). Reaction mixtures were 
incubated at 45°C for 30 min and the activity of the enzyme 
was measured as described previously. 

Effect  Of  Temperature  On  Enzyme  Activity  And  
Stability 

  The activity of the enzyme was determined by incubating 
the  reaction  mixture  at  different  temperatures  ranging  from 
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80°C were studied. The activity of 
the enzyme was measured as described previously.

Effect of Various Metal Ions on Protease Activity 

Protease Production and Effects of Different Parameters 

  The  effects  of  metal  ions  on  enzyme  activity  (e.g.,  
Ca2+,  Mg2+,  Fe2+,  Mn2+,  Zn2+,  Hg2+,  and  Cu2+  [5  mM])  were  
investigated  by  adding  them  to  the  reaction  mixture  and  
pre-incubated  for  30  min  at  45°C  pH  10.0.  The  activity  of 
the enzyme was measured as described previously. 

Effect of Organic Solvents on the Protease Stability 

  The  organic  solvents  used  were  Methanol,  Ethyl  acetate, 
Benzene,  Glycerol,  Sucrose,  Toluene,  Acetone,  Hexane, 
DMSO,  Isopropanol  and  Ethanol.  In  the  stability  test,  1.0  
ml  of  organic  solvent  (100%  v/v)  was  added  to  1  ml  of  
the  reaction  mixture  and  pre  incubated  at  37°C  for  30  min.  
The  remaining  proteolytic  activity  was  measured  as  de-
scribed previously. Stability  was  expressed as the remaining  
proteolytic  activity  relative  to  the  solvent-free  controls  
(0%, v/v). 

Protease  production  was  tested  at  various  time  interval 
 
(1–7  days)  and  influence  of  addition  of  various  nutrient 
sources  (TSB,  Gelatin,  Casein,  Skim  milk,  Pigeon  feathers) 
were  evaluated  in  relation  to  enzyme  yield.  Pseudomonas 
thermaerum  strain  GW1  grew  in  five  nutrient  sources  and 
produced  protease.  The  highest  protease  production  32 
units/mg  occurred  in  Basal  medium  supplemented  with  
casein  whereas  lowest  in  basal  medium  supplemented  with 
Pigeon  feathers  9.7units/mg  protein  after  48  hrs  of  cultiva-
tion (Fig. 2).

Identification  of  Protease-Producing  

 
Soil  samples  were  analyzed  for  isolation  of  proteolytic 
bacterial  cultures.  Screening  of  microorganisms  that  pro-
duced  protease  was  done  on  cultures  isolated  from  soil  of 
Ghazipur  poultry  waste  site.  Organic  waste  such  as  feathers 
and  other  poultry  waste  is  essentially  composed  of  proteins. 
Protease producing strains were selected by growth on skim 
milk  agar,  as  described  in  Methods.  Among  the  cultures 
tested,  the  laboratory  isolate  GW1  showed  highest  zone  of 
clearance. The purity of the isolated bacteria was ascertained 
through repeated streaking (Fig not shown).

  Microscopic  observation  of  the  isolate  showed  a  non 
sporulating  gram  negative 
the  bacterium  grew  
aerobically  and  formed  typical  blue  green,  flat,  large,  grape 
like  odour  colonies.  The  strain  showed  positive  reaction  for  
catalase,  oxidase,  citrate,  nitrate,  motility,  and  production  of 
pyoveridin and pyocyanin. Negative reactions were observed 
for  indole,  urea  and  starch  hydrolysis  (Table  1).  These  
phenotypic  characteristics  based  on  Bergey’s  Manual  of  
Determinative  Bacteriology  [16]  suggest  the  Pseudomonad-
aceae family genus Pseudomonas. 

Strain Identification by 16S rDNA Sequencing 

  The  GW1  strain  was  identified  to  be  as  Pseudomonas 
thermaerum as predicted by 16S rDNA studies. Studying the

Fig.  (2).  Study  of  effect  of  various  nutrient  sources  on  protease 
production  by  Pseudomonas  thermaerum  GW1.  The  culture  was 
grown for production of protease as described in “Methods”. 1% of 
the  above  mentioned  nutrient  sources  were  added  to  basal  media. 
pH of the media was adjusted to 7.5. 

pH Optimum and pH Stability  

  Activity  of  the  enzyme  was  determined  at  different  pH 
ranging  from  3.0-12.0.  The  optimum  pH  recorded  was  8.0 
for  protease  activity.  Protease  activity  was  found  to  be  
stable in the alkaline range starting from the pH 5-11 at 45°C 
(Fig. 5).  

Temperature Optimum and Thermal Stability 

  The  thermal  stability  of  the  enzyme  was  also  tested  at 
different  temperatures  20°C,  30°C,  40°C,  50°C,  60°C,  70°C 
and  80°C  on  incubation  for  60  minutes  (Fig.  6).  The  opti-

 has a strong inhibitory effect, whereas Zn2+

 and Hg2+
 
 
have  mild  effects  on  protease  activity.  Interestingly  Mn2+ 
strongly activated enzyme activity by 5 fold (Table 5). 

Effect of Organic Solvents on the Protease Stability 

  Ten  organic  solvents  were  used  to  study  the  effect  on 
protease  activity.  As  shown  in  (Fig.  7)  the  protease  has  
ability  to  act  in  the  presence  of  solvents  in  reaction  system. 
The  enzyme  retained  78%  and  75  %  of  activity  in  the  pres-
ence  of  ethylacetate  and  acetone  respectively.  The  presence 
of  isopropanol,  methanol  and  benzene  increased  the  activity 
of  isolates  GW1  by  2.7,  1.3  and  1.1  fold,  respectively.

Enzyme lost 60% of total activity in presence of DMSO and 
hexane  and  was  not  stable  in  the  presence  of  glycerol,  tolu-
ene and sucrose. Ogino et al., [22] have reported importance 
of  disulfide  bonds  for  stability  of  the  protein  in  presence  of 
solvents.  Jorden  et  al.,  [23]  have  reported  that  61%  of  the 
activity  of  HIV1  protease  was  lost  in  presence  of  12% 
Me2SO;  similar  results  were  also  reported  from  protease 
thrombin  [24].  This  loss  of  hydrolytic  activity  over  time  as 
reported  by  the  authors  is  not  due  to  slow  dissociation  of 
enzyme  dimer  into  inactive  monomer.  The  activity  of  HIV1 
is  also  sensitive  to  glycerol  and  the  hydrolytic  efficiency  of 
this  enzyme  decreases  with  the  increasing  concentration  of 
glycerol.

Protease from Pseudomonas thermaerum retained its activity 
in organic solvents; these results are in line with many stud-
ies  that  report  protease  stability  in  the  presence  of  organic 
solvents [25-29] promising potential industrial application of 
protease from Pseudomonas thermaerum.

Fig.  (5). Effect of pH on the activity of the purified Protease from 
Pseudomonas thermaerum GW1 pH optima was measured by incu-
bating the enzyme with the substrate at different pH values at 45°C. 
The maximum activity obtained at pH 8.0 was considered as 100% 
activity. The treated enzyme solution was cooled rapidly in ice and 
the relative activity was measured under standard condition.

  Table  6  reveals  that  if  the  concentration  of  glycerol  is  
as  low  as10%v/v.  then  there  is  38%  decrease  in  Protease 
activity whereas 45 %decrease in enzyme activity is reported 
in presence of 20%v/v glycerol. 

  Ours  is  the  first  report  that  shows  extracellular  produc-
tion  of  proteases  from  Pseudomonas  thermaerum.  Protease 
from GW1 strain lost its activity in the presence of glycerol, 
sucrose and metal ion iron.

  Enzyme  activity  from  Pseudomonas  thermaerum  is  
lost  in  the  presence  of  glycerol  and  sucrose.  The  buffer  
best  suited  for  Pseudomonas  thermaerum  protease  should 
minimize the use of glycerol and sucrose during dialysis.  

So  far,  several  well-known  proteases  such  as  thermo-
 
lysin,  papain,  and  chymotrypsin  have  been  used  as  biocata-

Fig.  (6). Effect of  temperature on protease activity  from Pseu-
domonas  thermaerum  GW1.  The  relative  activity  was  defined  as 
the  percentage  of  activity  detected  with  respect  to  the  maximum 
protease  activity.  The  maximum  activity  obtained  at  temperature 
60°C  was  considered  as  100%  activity.    The  treated  enzyme  solu-
tion  was  cooled  rapidly  in  ice  and  the  relative  activity  was  meas-
ured under standard condition.
