Actin polymerization plays a major

role in many cellular processes,
including cell motility, vesicle trafficking,
and pathogen propulsion. The trans-
formation of the (protrusive) polymeriza-
tion forces into directed motion requires
that the growing filaments are positioned
next to the surface. This is achieved by
localization of surface actin nucleators
(WASP), which then activate Arp2/3
complex to form new actin branches.

Actin polymerization plays a major role
in many cellular processes, including cell
motility1,2 and invasion,3-5 vesicle traffick-
ing and pathogens propulsion.6-8 In all
of these processes a branched actin net-
work is polymerized at the surface of the
membrane/vesicle/pathogen. The
trans-
formation of
the polymerization forces
into directed motion requires the (transient)

forms at

attachment of the network to the surface,
which is done by localizing to the surface
potent actin nucleators, e.g., WASP or
WAVE, which then activate the Arp2/3
complex to form a new branch point.9
The actin network that

the same
WASP molecule that initiates actin poly-
merization through the nucleation of new
actin branches, also inherently inhibits

a friction-like force), by binding to the
same branch point. This is an inherent

In our recent paper12 we show that
wild-type (WT) cortactin (constitutively
active) plays a critical role in enhancing
the ability to translate actin polymeriza-
tion at a surface into motion by releasing
WASP-VCA (i.e., the VCA domain of
WASP) molecules from the new branching
site. This enhanced release has two major
effects;
it increases the turnover rate of
branching per WASP molecule, and it
decreases the friction-like force caused by
the binding of the moving surface with
respect to the growing actin network.

In that work we

based movement. We tested the role of
different cortactin variants that interacts
with the Arp2/3 complex and actin
filaments distinctively: (1) WT cortactin
that binds
the Arp2/3 complex and
F-actin, (2) the NTA fragment that inter-
act with Arp2/3 complex but is lacking
the F-actin binding domain, and (3) a
mutant lacking the acidic DDW motif
that mediates binding to the Arp2/3
complex. Our findings show that WT
cortactin significantly enhances the bead
velocity at
low concentrations while it
inhibits motility at large concentrations,
which results in a non-monotonous velo-
city curve (Fig. 1). We did not see such
a significant effect on the velocity in the
case of
the non-F-actin binding NTA
molecule; rather, the velocity was mono-
tonously increasing with NTA concentra-
tion. For the mutant lacking the Arp2/3
complex binding motif (DDW mutant)
we found that the velocity continuously
decreases with the concentration. Single

rate of

filament experiments
showed also that
WT cortactin had no significant effect on
the
actin polymerization and
branch stability. Yet, it strongly affected
(non-monotonously)
the branching rate
driven by VCA-Arp2/3 complex: whereas
at
low concentrations, cortactin signifi-
cantly increases
the rate of branching,
at
large concentrations the situation is
reversed. Repeating the experiments using
the two variants showed that the NTA
fragment
is effective in increasing the
branching rate, although less than WT
cortactin, while the DDW mutant only
interferes with the branching process.

These data indicate that the main effect
of cortactin on Arp2/3-mediated branch-
ing is the increase in the branching rate
due to cortactin capability to enhance the
release of WASP-VCA from the VCA/
Arp2/3 complex/F-actin complexes (i.e.,
branch point), thereby allowing it to have
a higher turnover rate. This means that
each molecule of WASP-VCA can have
rate of participation in the
a higher

Figure 1. In the bottom part is depicted a schematic plot of the bead velocity as a function of
the cortactin concentration. At low concentrations, cortactin enhances the release of WASP-VCA
molecules from the newly-formed branches, which induce an increase in the bead velocity.
At high concentrations cortactin has an inhibitory effect due to its high affinity to F-actin, leading to
its attachment to the filaments and prevents the binding of WASP-VCA-Arp2/3 complex and branch
formation.

nucleation of Arp2/3 branch points.
Analysis of the actin gel density near the
bead surface leads to the conclusion that
WT cortactin is able to efficiently release
WASP-VCA and increase the branching
rate near
the moving bead, while the
NTA fragment and a mutant lacking the
acidic DDW motif that binds the Arp2/3
complex do not. This observation high-
lights the efficiency of the WT molecule
especially in the context of moving sur-
face. The branching rate near a moving
bead surface controls the local density of
actin gel, which controls the strength of
the pushing force exerted by the gel.10,11
Furthermore, in addition to enhancing the
turn-over of the WASP-VCA molecules
at the bead surface, the faster release also
reduces the effective drag force acting on
the bead, thereby increasing its velocity.
This effective drag force arises from the
transient connection between the bead
and the comet-tail of actin gel, through
the WASP-VCA association with the
newly nucleated branches. We find that
this additional effect plays a dominant
role in the bead motility enhancement.

We conclude that the WT cortactin’s
affinity to F-actin enhances its efficacy in
releasing the WASP-VCA from the newly-
formed junction, compared with the NTA
fragment. Yet,
this added efficiency at
low concentrations has the price of an
inhibitory effect at large concentrations,
due to the same affinity to F-actin, i.e.,
the WT cortactin decorates the F-actin,
preventing WASP-VCA/Arp2/3 complex
from attaching to the
actin
filaments and initiating new branches,
and therefore decreases
the branching
rate. The F-actin affinity of WT cortactin
is responsible for the non-monotonous
behavior both in the bead motility mea-
surements and in the measured branching
rate of
the
DDW mutant only decorates the F-actin,
thereby only reducing the branching rate
and bead motility. The NTA fragment
enhances the branching rate (of individual
filaments) and bead motility in a mono-
tonous manner, since it cannot decorate
the F-actin.

gen propulsion. In all of these cases, the
function of cortactin depends on binding
partners, which include a variety of mem-
brane trafficking and signaling proteins.5
Practically all of the cellular activities
of cortactin, including cell migration and
invasion, require association with Arp2/3
complex and the actin cytoskeleton.1,13-16

both cases
the actin polymerization is

our bead motility experiments), but

monotonously increasing with cortactin
concentration. The activity of cortactin
can be regulated by different biochemical
modifications such as acetylation17 and
phosphorylation18-21 (mediated by Src and
Erk). Comparing to our in vitro work (in
which we use an active form of cortactin)
we speculate that the local concentration
of active cortactin may be regulated by
signaling molecules so that it is maintained

tion, where cortactin decoration of the

through various signaling molecules there
is a negative feedback whereby cortactin is
activated only when the concentration of
bare F-actin is high, and is deactivated
when bare F-actin is rare. This will have
the effect of deactivating cortactin as soon
as its concentration increases too much
and it starts decorating bare F-actin.

Although in all cellular processes cor-
tactin action involves the interaction with
the actin cytoskeleton and the Arp2/3
complex, the impact of cortactin can be
very different. One can divide the processes
in which cortactin is involved to two types:
(1) Processes in which cortactin pres-
ence is not essential, but
its presence
enhances the efficiency of a given process.
For example, a cortactin knock-down
does not

suggesting that it is not essential for its

cortactin enhances lamellipodial stability
and persistence, as well as cell motility.1,2

down of cortactin reduces cell motility by
a factor of ~2; this effect was attributed to
a decrease in Fibronectin exocytosis and

function, where
knockdown of cortactin was shown to
effectively abolish this process.24,25 This is
a multistep process, which was suggested
to include the fission of vesicles from the
trans-Golgi network, the assembly of actin
comet tails for the propulsion of vesicles
toward the plasma membrane (PM), the
capture and fusion of vesicles at the PM.24
In all of these processes, cortactin may be
involved in the regulation of the actin
network assembly dynamics and/or by

bridging the actin network to vesicular
trafficking proteins, such as dynamin-2.

While processes of type (1) are in direct
correlation to our finding that cortactin
simply enhances motility by a sizable
factor (bead velocity increased by a factor
of ~2), it is harder to explain the more
dramatic effects of cortactin reported in
processes of type (2). We note that type
(2) processes involve a series of events
involving intra-cellular vesicles including
their formation, transport, docking, and
fusion. When the actin pushing force is
reduced by removing cortactin, each of
these processes may be reduced until the
whole chain of events is disrupted. The
whole series of events, or a particular key
process along the chain, could behave as
having a threshold such that below some
critical level of activity the whole process
stops. Inducement of vesicle fusion, for
example, may require a minimal pushing
force in order to overcome the mechanical
barrier at the cell cortex.

Future work will have

to identify
cortactin’s binding partners which regulate
cortactin’s activity and action on the
dynamic reorganization of the actin cyto-
skeleton during different cellular processes.
